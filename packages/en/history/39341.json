Whether viewed from some promontory where the eye seeks in vain\r\nanother resting-place, or when sailing over the deep, one looks around on\r\nthe unbounded expanse of waters, the sea must always give rise to ideas of\r\ninfinite space and indefinable mystery hardly paralleled by anything of\r\nthe earth itself. Beneficent in its calmer aspect, when the silvery moon\r\nlights up the ripples and the good ship scuds along before a favouring\r\nbreeze; terrible in its might, when its merciless breakers dash upon some\r\nrock-girt coast, carrying the gallant bark to destruction, or when, rising\r\nmountains high, the spars quiver and snap before the tempest’s power, it\r\nis always grand, sublime, irresistible. The great highway of commerce and\r\nsource of boundless supplies, it is, notwithstanding its terrors,\r\ninfinitely more man’s friend than his enemy. In how great a variety of\r\naspects may it not be viewed!\r\n\r\nThe poets have seen in it a “type of the Infinite,” and one of the\r\ngreatest(1) has taken us back to those early days of earth’s history when\r\nGod said—\r\n\r\n         “‘Let there be firmament\r\n  Amid the waters, and let it divide\r\n  The waters from the waters.’ ...\r\n         So He the world\r\n  Built on circumfluous waters calm, in wide\r\n  Crystalline ocean.”\r\n\r\n“Water,” said the great Greek lyric poet,(2) “is the chief of all.” The\r\nocean covers nearly three-fourths of the surface of our globe. Earth is\r\nits mere offspring. The continents and islands have been and _still are\r\nbeing_ elaborated from its depths. All in all, it has not, however, been\r\ntreated fairly at the hands of the poets, too many of whom could only see\r\nit in its sterner lights. Young speaks of it as merely a\r\n\r\n     “Dreadful and tumultuous home\r\n  Of dangers, at eternal war with man,\r\n  Wide opening and loud roaring still for more,”\r\n\r\nignoring the blessings and benefits it has bestowed so freely, forgetting\r\nthat man is daily becoming more and more its master, and that his own\r\ncountry in particular has most successfully conquered the seemingly\r\nunconquerable. Byron, again, says:—\r\n\r\n  “Roll on, thou dark and deep blue ocean—roll!\r\n  Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;\r\n  Man marks the earth with ruin—his control\r\n  Stops with the shore; upon the watery plain\r\n  The wrecks are all thy deeds.”\r\n\r\nAnd though this is but the exaggerated and not strictly accurate language\r\nof poetry, we may, with Pollok, fairly address the great sea as “strongest\r\nof creation’s sons.” The first impressions produced on most animals—not\r\nexcluding altogether man—by the aspect of the ocean, are of terror in\r\ngreater or lesser degree. Livingstone tells us that he had intended to\r\nbring to England from Africa a friendly native, a man courageous as the\r\nlion he had often braved. He had never voyaged upon nor even beheld the\r\nsea, and on board the ship which would have safely borne him to a friendly\r\nshore he became delirious and insane. Though assured of safety and\r\ncarefully watched, he escaped one day, and blindly threw himself headlong\r\ninto the waves. The sea terrified him, and yet held and drew him,\r\nfascinated as under a spell. “Even at ebb-tide,” says Michelet,(3) “when,\r\nplacid and weary, the wave crawls softly on the sand, the horse does not\r\nrecover his courage. He trembles, and frequently refuses to pass the\r\nlanguishing ripple. The dog barks and recoils, and, according to his\r\nmanner, insults the billows which he fears.... We are told by a traveller\r\nthat the dogs of Kamtschatka, though accustomed to the spectacle, are not\r\nthe less terrified and irritated by it. In numerous troops, they howl\r\nthrough the protracted night against the howling waves, and endeavour to\r\noutvie in fury the Ocean of the North.”\r\n\r\nThe civilised man’s fear is founded, it must be admitted, on a reasonable\r\nknowledge of the ocean, so much his friend and yet so often his foe. Man\r\nis not independent of his fellow-man in distant countries, nor is it\r\ndesirable that he should be. No land produces all the necessaries, and the\r\nluxuries which have begun to be considered necessaries, sufficient for\r\nitself. Transportation by land is often impracticable, or too costly, and\r\nthe ocean thus becomes the great highway of nations. Vessel after vessel,\r\nfleet after fleet, arrive safely and speedily. But as there is danger for\r\nman lurking everywhere on land, so also is there on the sea. The world’s\r\nwreck-chart for one year must, as we shall see hereafter, be something\r\nappalling. That for the British Empire alone in one year has often\r\nexceeded 1,000 vessels, great and small! Averaging three years, we find\r\nthat there was an annual loss during that period of 1,095 vessels and\r\n1,952 lives.(4) Nor are the ravages of ocean confined to the engulfment of\r\nvessels, from rotten “coffin-ships” to splendid ironclads. The coasts\r\noften bear witness of her fury.\r\n\r\nThe history of the sea virtually comprises the history of adventure,\r\nconquest, and commerce, in all times, and might almost be said to be that\r\nof the world itself. We cannot think of it without remembering the great\r\nvoyagers and sea-captains, the brave naval commanders, the pirates,\r\nrovers, and buccaneers of bygone days. Great sea-fights and notable\r\nshipwrecks recur to our memory—the progress of naval supremacy, and the\r\nmeans by which millions of people and countless millions of wealth have\r\nbeen transferred from one part of the earth to another. We cannot help\r\nthinking, too, of “Poor Jack” and life before the mast, whether on the\r\nfinest vessel of the Royal Navy, or in the worst form of trading ship. We\r\nrecall the famous ships themselves, and their careers. We remember, too,\r\nthe “toilers of the sea”—the fishermen, whalers, pearl-divers, and\r\ncoral-gatherers; the noble men of the lighthouse, lifeboat, and coastguard\r\nservices. The horrors of the sea—its storms, hurricanes, whirlpools,\r\nwaterspouts, impetuous and treacherous currents—rise vividly before our\r\nmental vision. Then there are the inhabitants of the sea to be\r\nconsidered—from the tiniest germ of life to the great leviathan, or even\r\nthe doubtful sea-serpent. And even the lowest depths of ocean, with their\r\nmountains, valleys, plains, and luxurious marine vegetation, are full of\r\ninterest; while at the same time we irresistibly think of the submerged\r\ntreasure-ships of days gone by, and the submarine cables of to-day. Such\r\nare among the subjects we propose to lay before our readers. THE SEA, as\r\none great topic, must comprise descriptions of life on, around, and in the\r\nocean—the perils, mysteries, phenomena, and poetry of the great deep. The\r\nsubject is too vast for superfluous detail: it would require as many\r\nvolumes as a grand encyclopædia to do it justice; whilst a formal and\r\nchronological history would weary the reader. At all events, the present\r\nwriter purposes to occasionally gossip and digress, and to arrange facts\r\nin groups, not always following the strict sequence of events. The voyage\r\nof to-day may recall that of long ago: the discovery made long ago may be\r\ntraced, by successive leaps, as it were, to its results in the present\r\nepoch. We can hardly be wrong in believing that this grand subject has an\r\nespecial interest for the English reader everywhere; for the spirit of\r\nenterprise, enthusiasm, and daring which has carried our flag to the\r\nuttermost parts of the earth, and has made the proud words “Britannia\r\nrules the waves” no idle vaunt, is shared by a very large proportion of\r\nher sons and daughters, at home and abroad. Britain’s part in the\r\nexploration and settlement of the whole world has been so pre-eminent that\r\nthere can be no wonder if, among the English-speaking races everywhere, a\r\npeculiar fascination attaches to the sea and all concerning it. Countless\r\nthousands of books have been devoted to the land, not a tithe of the\r\nnumber to the ocean. Yet the subject is one of almost boundless interest,\r\nand has a special importance at the present time, when so much intelligent\r\nattention and humane effort is being put forth to ameliorate the condition\r\nof our seafarers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MEN-OF-WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n       Our Wooden Walls—The _Victory_—Siege of Toulon—Battle of St.\r\n    Vincent—Nelson’s Bridge—Trafalgar’s glorious Day—The Day for such\r\n       Battles gone—Iron _v._ Wood—Lessons of the Crimean War—Moral\r\n           Effect of the Presence of our Fleets—Bombardment of\r\n     Sebastopol—Red-hot Shot and Gibraltar—The Ironclad Movement—The\r\n      _Warrior_—Experiences with Ironclads—The _Merrimac_ in Hampton\r\n        Roads—A speedily decided Action—The _Cumberland_ sunk and\r\n         _Congress_ burned—The first Monitor—Engagement with the\r\n      _Merrimac_—Notes on recent Actions—The _Shah_ and _Huascar_—An\r\n                    Ironclad tackled by a Merchantman.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIf the reader should at any time find himself a visitor to the first naval\r\nport of Great Britain—which he need not be told is Portsmouth—he will\r\nfind, lying placidly in the noble harbour, which is large enough to\r\naccommodate a whole fleet, a vessel of modern-antique appearance, and\r\nevidently very carefully preserved.

Nor will he be surprised\r\nat this when he learns that it is none other than the famous _Victory_,\r\nthat carried Nelson’s flag on the sad but glorious day of Trafalgar, and\r\nwent bravely through so many a storm of war and weather. Very little of\r\nthe oft-shattered hulk of the original vessel remains, it is true—she has\r\nbeen so often renewed and patched and painted; yet the lines and form of\r\nthe old three-decker remain to show us what the flag-ship of Hood, and\r\nJervis, and Nelson was in general appearance. She towers grandly out of\r\nthe water, making the few sailors and loiterers on deck look like\r\nmarionettes—mere miniature men; and as our wherry approaches the\r\nentrance-port, we admire the really graceful lines of the planks,\r\ndiminishing in perspective. The triple battery of formidable guns, peeping\r\nfrom under the stout old ports which overshadowed them, the enormous\r\ncables and spare anchors, and the immensely thick masts, heavy shrouds and\r\nrigging, which she had in old times, must have given an impression of\r\nsolidity in this good old “heart of oak” which is wanting even in the\r\nstrongest-built iron vessel. Many a brave tar has lost his life on her,\r\nbut yet she is no coffin-ship. On board, one notes the scrupulous order,\r\nthe absolute perfection of cleanliness and trimness; the large guns and\r\ncarriages alternating with the mess-tables of the crew. And we should not\r\nthink much of the man who could stand emotionless and unmoved over the\r\nspots—still pointed out on the upper deck and cockpit below—where Nelson\r\nfell and Nelson died, on that memorable 21st, off Trafalgar Bay. He had\r\nembarked, only five weeks before, from the present resting-place of his\r\nbrave old ship, when enthusiastic crowds had pressed forward to bless and\r\ntake one last look at England’s preserver. “I had their hurrahs before,”\r\nsaid the poor shattered hero; “now I have their hearts!” And when, three\r\nmonths later, his body was brought home, the sailors divided the leaden\r\ncoffin into fragments, as relics of “Saint Nelson,” as his gunner had\r\ntermed him.\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: THE “VICTORY” AT PORTSMOUTH.]\r\n\r\nThe _Victory_ was one of the largest ships of war of her day and\r\ngeneration. She was rated for 100 guns, but really carried 102, and was\r\nclassed first-rate with such ships as the _Royal Sovereign_ and\r\n_Britannia_, both of 100, carrying only two in excess of the “brave old\r\n_Téméraire_”—made still more famous by Turner’s great picture—and the\r\n_Dreadnought_, which but a few years back was such a familiar feature of\r\nthe reach of the Thames in front of Greenwich. She was of 2,164 tons\r\nburden, and, having been launched in 1765, is now a good 112 years of age.\r\nHer complement was 841 men. From the first she deserved her name, and\r\nseemed destined to be associated with little else than success and\r\ntriumph. Nelson frequently complains in his journals of the\r\nunseaworthiness of many of his vessels; but this, his last flag-ship, was\r\na veritable “heart of oak,” and endured all the tests that the warfare of\r\nthe elements or of man could bring against her.\r\n\r\nThe good ship of which we have spoken more particularly is now enjoying a\r\nwell-earned repose, after passing nearly unscathed through the very thick\r\nof battles inscribed on the most brilliant page of our national history.\r\nHer part was in reality a very prominent one; and a glance at a few of the\r\nengagements at which she was present may serve to show us what she and\r\nother ships like her were made of, and what they were able to effect in\r\nnaval warfare. The _Victory_ had been built nearly thirty years when, in\r\n1793, she first came prominently to the front, at the occupation and\r\nsubsequent siege of Toulon, as the flag-ship of Lord Hood, then in command\r\nof a large fleet destined for the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nFrance was at that moment in a very revolutionary condition, but in Toulon\r\nthere was a strong feeling of loyalty for the Bourbons and monarchical\r\ninstitutions. In the harbour a large French fleet was assembled—some\r\nseventeen vessels of the line, besides many other smaller craft—while\r\nseveral large ships of war were refitting and building; the whole under\r\nthe command of the Comte de Trogoff, an ardent Royalist. On the appearance\r\nof the British fleet in the offing, two commissioners came out to the\r\nflag-ship, the _Victory_, to treat for the conditional surrender of the\r\nport and shipping. The Government had not miscalculated the disaffection\r\nexisting, and the negotiations being completely successful, 1,700 of our\r\nsoldiers, sailors, and marines were landed, and shortly afterwards, when a\r\nSpanish fleet appeared, an English governor and a Spanish commandant were\r\nappointed, while Louis XVII. was proclaimed king. But it is needless to\r\nsay that the French Republic strongly objected to all this, and soon\r\nassembled a force numbering 45,000 men for the recapture of Toulon. The\r\nEnglish and their Royalist allies numbered under 13,000, and it became\r\nevident that the city must be evacuated, although not until it should be\r\nhalf destroyed. The important service of destroying the ships and\r\nmagazines had been mainly entrusted to Captain Sir Sidney Smith, who\r\nperformed his difficult task with wonderful precision and order, and\r\nwithout the loss of one man. Shots and shells were plunged into the very\r\narsenal, and trains were laid up to the magazines and storehouses; a\r\nfire-ship was towed into the basin, and in a few hours gave out flames and\r\nshot, accompanied by terrible explosions. The Spanish admiral had\r\nundertaken the destruction of the shipping in the basin, and to scuttle\r\ntwo powder-vessels, but his men, in their flurry, managed to ignite one of\r\nthem in place of sinking it, and the explosion which occurred can be\r\nbetter imagined than described. The explosion shook the _Union_ gunboat to\r\npieces, killing the commander and three of the crew; and a second boat was\r\nblown into the air, but her crew were miraculously saved. Having completed\r\nthe destruction of the arsenal, Sir Sidney proceeded towards the basin in\r\nfront of the town, across which a boom had been laid, where he and his men\r\nwere received with such volleys of musketry that they turned their\r\nattention in another direction. In the inner road were lying two large\r\n74-gun ships—the _Héros_ and _Thémistocle_—filled with French prisoners.\r\nAlthough the latter were greatly superior to the attacking force, they\r\nwere so terrified that they agreed to be removed and landed in a place of\r\nsafety, after which the ships were destroyed by fire. Having done all that\r\nman could do, they were preparing to return, when the second\r\npowder-vessel, which should only have been scuttled by the Spaniards,\r\nexploded. Wonderful to relate, although the little _Swallow_, Sir Sidney’s\r\ntender, and three boats were in the midst of the falling timbers, and\r\nnearly swamped by the waves produced, they escaped in safety. Nowadays\r\ntorpedoes would settle the business of blowing up vessels of the kind in a\r\nmuch safer and surer manner. The evacuation was effected without loss,\r\nnearly 15,000 Toulonese refugees—men, women, and children—being taken on\r\nboard for removal to England. Fifteen French ships of war were taken off\r\nas prizes, while the magazines, storehouses, and shipping were destroyed\r\nby fire. The total number of vessels taken or burned by the British was\r\neighteen of the line, nine frigates, and eleven corvettes, and would have\r\nbeen much greater but for the blundering or treachery of the Spaniards,\r\nand the pusillanimous flight of the Neapolitans. Thus the _Victory_ was\r\nthe silent witness of an almost bloodless success, so far as our forces\r\nwere concerned, in spite of the noise and smoke and flame by which it was\r\naccompanied. A little later, she was engaged in the siege of Bastia,\r\nCorsica, which was taken by a naval force numbering about one-fourth of\r\ntheir opponents; and again at Calvi, where Nelson lost an eye and helped\r\nto gain the day. In the spring of 1795 she was again in the Mediterranean,\r\nand for once was engaged in what has been described as a “miserable\r\naction,” although the action, or want thereof, was all on the part of a\r\nvice-admiral who, as Nelson said, “took things too coolly.” Twenty-three\r\nBritish line-of-battle ships, whilst engaging, off the Hyères Isles, only\r\nseventeen French, with the certainty of triumphant results, if not,\r\nindeed, of the complete annihilation of the enemy, were signalled by\r\nAdmiral Hotham to discontinue the fight. The disgust of the commanders in\r\ngeneral and Nelson in particular can well be understood. The only prize\r\ntaken, the _Alcide_, blew up, with the loss of half her crew, as if in\r\nvery disgust at having surrendered, and we can well believe that even the\r\ninanimate timbers of the _Victory_ and her consorts groaned as they were\r\ndrawn off from the scene of action. The fight off the Hyères must be\r\ninscribed in black, but happily the next to be recorded might well be\r\nwritten with letters of gold in the annals of our country, although its\r\nglory was soon afterwards partially eclipsed by others still greater.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir John Jervis hoisted his flag on board the _Victory_ it marked an\r\nepoch not merely in our career of conquest, but also in the history of the\r\nnavy as a navy. Jervis, though then over sixty years of age, was hale and\r\nhearty, and if sometimes stern and severe as a disciplinarian, should long\r\nbe remembered as one who honestly and constantly strove to raise the\r\ncharacter of the service to its highest condition of efficiency, and he\r\nwas brave as a lion. As the Spanish fleet loomed through the morning fog,\r\noff Cape St. Vincent, it was found that Cordova’s force consisted of\r\ntwenty-nine large men-of-war, exclusive of a dozen 34-gun frigates,\r\nseventy transports, and other vessels. Jervis was walking the quarter-deck\r\nas the successive reports were brought to him. “There are eighteen sail of\r\nthe line, Sir John.” “Very well, sir.” “There are twenty sail, Sir John.”\r\n“Very well, sir.” “There are twenty-seven sail of the line, Sir John;\r\nnearly double our own.” “Enough, sir, no more of that, sir; if there are\r\nfifty I’ll go through them.” “That’s right, Sir John,” said Halliwell, his\r\nflag-captain, “and a jolly good licking we’ll give them.”\r\n\r\nThe grand fleet of Spain included six ships of 112 guns each, and the\r\nflag-ship _Santissima Trinidada_, a four-decker, carrying 130. There were,\r\nbesides, twenty-two vessels of eighty and seventy-four guns. To this large\r\nforce Jervis could only oppose fifteen vessels of the line, only two of\r\nwhich carried 100 guns, three of ninety-eight guns, one of ninety, and the\r\nremainder, with one exception, seventy-four each. Owing to gross\r\nmismanagement on the part of the Spaniards, their vessels were scattered\r\nabout in all directions, and six(5) of them were separated wholly from the\r\nmain body, neither could they rejoin it. The English vessels advanced in\r\ntwo lines, compactly and steadily, and as they neared the Spaniards, were\r\nsignalled from the _Victory_ to tack in succession. Nelson, on the\r\n_Captain_, was in the rear of the line, and he perceived that the\r\nSpaniards were bearing up before the wind, either with the intention of\r\ntrying to join their separated ships, or perhaps to avoid an engagement\r\naltogether. By disobeying the admiral’s signal, he managed to run clear\r\nathwart the bows of the Spanish ships, and was soon engaged with the great\r\n_Santissima Trinidada_, four other of the larger vessels, and two smaller\r\nones. Trowbridge, in the _Culloden_, immediately came to the support, and\r\nfor nearly an hour the unequal contest continued, till the _Blenheim_\r\npassed between them and the enemy, and gave them a little respite, pouring\r\nin her fire upon the Spaniards. One of the Spanish seventy-fours struck,\r\nand Nelson thought that the _Salvador_, of 112 guns, struck also.\r\n“Collingwood,” wrote Nelson, “disdaining the parade of taking possession\r\nof beaten enemies, most gallantly pushed up, with every sail set, to save\r\nhis old friend and messmate, who was, to appearance, in a critical\r\nsituation,” for the _Captain_ was being peppered by five vessels of the\r\nenemy’s fleet, and shortly afterwards was rendered absolutely\r\nincapable—not a sail, shroud, or rope left, with a topmast and the\r\nsteering-wheel shot away. As Dr. Bennett sings(6)—\r\n\r\n  “Ringed round by five three-deckers, she had fought through all the\r\n              fight,\r\n  And now, a log upon the waves, she lay—a glorious sight—\r\n  All crippled, but still full of fight, for still her broadsides roared,\r\n  Still death and wounds, fear and defeat, into the Don she poured.”\r\n\r\nTwo of Nelson’s antagonists were now nearly _hors de combat_, one of them,\r\nthe _San Nicolas_, in trying to escape from Collingwood’s fire, having got\r\nfoul of the _San Josef_. Nelson resolved in an instant to board and\r\ncapture _both_—an unparalleled feat, which, however, was accomplished,\r\nalthough\r\n\r\n          “To get at the _San Josef_, it seemed beyond a hope;\r\n  Out then our admiral spoke, and well his words our blood could stir—\r\n  ‘In, boarders, to their seventy-four! We’ll make a bridge of her.’”\r\n\r\nThe “bridge” was soon taken; but a steady fire of musketry was poured upon\r\nthem from the _San Josef_. Nelson directed his people to fire into the\r\nstern, and sending for more boarders, led the way up the main-chains,\r\nexclaiming, “Westminster Abbey or victory!” In a few moments the officers\r\nand crew surrendered; and on the quarter-deck of a Spanish first-rate he\r\nreceived the swords of the vanquished, which he handed to William Fearney,\r\none of his bargemen, who tucked them, with the greatest _sang-froid_, in a\r\nperfect sheaf under his arm. The _Victory_ came up at the moment, and\r\nsaluted the conquerors with hearty cheers.\r\n\r\nIt will be hardly necessary here to point out the altered circumstances of\r\nnaval warfare at the present day. A wooden vessel of the old type, with\r\nlarge and numerous portholes, and affording other opportunities for\r\nentering or climbing the sides, is a very different affair to the modern\r\nsmooth-walled iron vessel, on which a fly would hardly get a foothold,\r\nwith few openings or weak points, and where the grappling-iron would be\r\nuseless. Apart from this, with heavy guns carrying with great accuracy,\r\nand the facilities afforded by steam, we shall seldom hear, in the future,\r\nof a fight at close quarters; skilful manœuvring, impossible with a\r\nsailing vessel, will doubtless be more in vogue.\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: ROCKS NEAR CAPE ST. VINCENT.]\r\n\r\nMeantime, the _Victory_ had not been idle. In conjunction with two of the\r\nfleet, she had succeeded in silencing the _Salvador del Mundi_, a\r\nfirst-rate of 112 guns. When, after the fight, Nelson went on board the\r\n_Victory_, Sir John Jervis took him to his arms, and insisted that he\r\nshould keep the sword taken from the Spanish rear-admiral. When it was\r\nhinted, during some private conversation, that Nelson’s move was\r\nunauthorised, Jervis had to admit the fact, but promised to forgive any\r\nsuch breach of orders, accompanied with the same measure of success.\r\n\r\nThe battle had now lasted from noon, and at five p.m. four Spanish\r\nline-of-battle vessels had lowered their colours. Even the great\r\n_Santissima Trinidada_ might then have become a prize but for the return\r\nof the vessels which had been cut off from the fleet in the morning, and\r\nwhich alone saved her. Her colours had been shot away, and she had hoisted\r\nEnglish colours in token of submission, when the other ships came up, and\r\nCordova reconsidered his step. Jervis did not think that his fleet was\r\nquite equal to a fresh conflict; and the Spaniards showed no desire to\r\nrenew the fight. They had lost on the four prizes, alone, 261 killed, and\r\n342 wounded, and in all, probably, nearly double the above. The British\r\nloss was seventy-three killed, and 227 wounded.\r\n\r\nOf Trafalgar and of Nelson, both day and man so intimately associated with\r\nour good ship, what can yet be said or sung that has gone unsaid,\r\nunsung?—how when he left Portsmouth the crowds pressed forward to obtain\r\none last look at their hero—England’s greatest hero—and “knelt down before\r\nhim, and blessed him as he passed;”(7) that beautiful prayer, indited in\r\nhis cabin, “May the great God whom I worship grant to my country, and for\r\nthe benefit of Europe in general, a great and glorious victory, and may no\r\nmisconduct in any one tarnish it, and may humanity after victory be the\r\npredominant feature of the British fleet,” or the now historical signal\r\nwhich flew from the mizen top-gallant mast of that noble old ship, and\r\nwhich has become one of the grand mottoes of our tongue, are facts as\r\nfamiliar to every reader as household words.\r\n\r\nThe part directly played by the _Victory_ herself in the battle of\r\nTrafalgar was second to none. From the very first she received a raking\r\nfire from all sides, which must have been indeed severe, when we find the\r\nwords extorted from Nelson, “This is too warm work to last long,”\r\naddressed to Captain Hardy. At that moment fifty of his men were lying\r\ndead or wounded, while the _Victory’s_ mizen-mast and wheel were shot\r\naway, and her sails hanging in ribbons. To the terrible cannonading of the\r\nenemy, Nelson had not yet returned a shot. He had determined to be in the\r\nvery thick of the fight, and was reserving his fire. Now it was that\r\nCaptain Hardy represented to Nelson the impracticability of passing\r\nthrough the enemy’s line without running on board one of their ships; he\r\nwas coolly told to take his choice. The _Victory_ was accordingly turned\r\non board the _Redoubtable_, the commander of which, Captain Lucas, in a\r\nresolute endeavour to block the passage, himself ran his bowsprit into the\r\nfigurehead of the _Bucentaure_, and the two vessels became locked\r\ntogether. Not many minutes later, Captain Harvey, of the _Téméraire_,\r\nseeing the position of the _Victory_ with her two assailants, fell on\r\nboard the _Redoubtable_, on the other side, so that these four ships\r\nformed as compact a tier as though moored together. The _Victory_ fired\r\nher middle and lower deck guns into the _Redoubtable_, which returned the\r\nfire from her main-deck, employing also musketry and brass pieces of\r\nlarger size with most destructive effects from the tops.\r\n\r\n  “_Redoubtable_ they called her—a curse upon her name!\r\n  ’Twas from her tops the bullet that killed our hero came.”\r\n\r\nWithin a few minutes of Lord Nelson’s fall, several officers and about\r\nforty men were either killed or wounded from this source. But a few\r\nminutes afterwards the _Redoubtable_ fell on board the _Téméraire_, the\r\nFrench ship’s bowsprit passing over the British ship. Now came one of the\r\nwarmest episodes of the fight. The crew of the _Téméraire_ lashed their\r\nvessel to their assailants’ ship, and poured in a raking fire. But the\r\nFrench captain, having discovered that—owing, perhaps, to the sympathy\r\nexhibited for the dying hero on board the _Victory_, and her excessive\r\nlosses in men—her quarter-deck was quite deserted, now ordered an attempt\r\nat boarding the latter. This cost our flag-ship the lives of Captain Adair\r\nand eighteen men, but at the same moment the _Téméraire_ opened fire on\r\nthe _Redoubtable_ with such effect that Captain Lucas and 200 men were\r\nthemselves placed _hors de combat_.\r\n\r\nIn the contest we have been relating, the coolness of the _Victory’s_ men\r\nwas signally evinced. “When the guns on the lower deck were run out, their\r\nmuzzles came in contact with the sides of the _Redoubtable_, and now was\r\nseen an astounding spectacle. Knowing that there was danger of the French\r\nship taking fire, the fireman of each gun on board the British ship stood\r\nready with a bucketful of water to dash into the hole made by the shot of\r\nhis gun—thus beautifully illustrating Nelson’s prayer, ‘that the British\r\nmight be distinguished by humanity in victory.’ Less considerate than her\r\nantagonist, the _Redoubtable_ threw hand-grenades from her tops, which,\r\nfalling on board herself, set fire to her, ... and the flame communicated\r\nwith the foresail of the _Téméraire_, and caught some ropes and canvas on\r\nthe booms of the _Victory_, risking the destruction of all; but by immense\r\nexertions the fire was subdued in the British ships, whose crews lent\r\ntheir assistance to extinguish the flames on board the _Redoubtable_, by\r\nthrowing buckets of water upon her chains and forecastle.”(8)\r\n\r\nSetting aside, for the purpose of clearness, the episode of the taking of\r\nthe _Fougueux_, which got foul of the _Téméraire_ and speedily\r\nsurrendered, we find, five minutes later, the main and mizen masts of the\r\n_Redoubtable_ falling—the former in such a way across the _Téméraire_ that\r\nit formed a bridge, over which the boarding-party passed and took quiet\r\npossession. Captain Lucas had so stoutly defended his flag, that, out of a\r\ncrew of 643, only 123 were in a condition to continue the fight; 522 were\r\nlying killed or wounded. The _Bucentaure_ soon met her fate, after being\r\ndefended with nearly equal bravery. The French admiral, Villeneuve, who\r\nwas on board, said bitterly, just before surrendering, “_Le Bucentaure a\r\nrempli sa tâche; la mienne n’est pas encore achevée_.”\r\n\r\nLet the reader remember that the above are but a few episodes of the most\r\ncomplete and glorious victory ever obtained in naval warfare. Without the\r\nloss of one single vessel to the conqueror, more than half the ships of\r\nthe enemy were captured or destroyed, while the remainder escaped into\r\nharbour to rot in utter uselessness. Twenty-one vessels were lost for ever\r\nto France and Spain. It is to be hoped and believed that no such contest\r\nwill ever again be needed; but should it be needed, it will have to be\r\nfought by very different means. The instance of four great ships locked\r\ntogether, dealing death and destruction to each other, has never been\r\nparalleled. Imagine that seething, fighting, dying mass of humanity, with\r\nall the horrible concomitants of deafening noise and blinding smoke and\r\nflashing fire! It is not likely ever to occur in modern warfare. The\r\ncommanders of steam-vessels of all classes will be more likely to fight at\r\nout-manœuvring and shelling each other than to come to close quarters,\r\nwhich would generally mean blowing up together. It would be interesting to\r\nconsider how Nelson would have acted with, and opposed to, steam-frigates\r\nand ironclads. He would, no doubt, have been as courageous and far-seeing\r\nand rapid in action as ever, but hardly as reckless, or even daring.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: THE “VICTORY” AT CLOSE QUARTERS WITH THE “REDOUBTABLE.”]\r\n\r\n  “And still, though seventy years, boys,\r\n    Have gone, who, without pride,\r\n  Names his name—tells his fame\r\n    Who at Trafalgar died?”\r\n\r\nMay we always have a Nelson in the hour of national need!\r\n\r\nThe day for such battles as this is over; there may be others as\r\ngloriously fought, but never again by the same means. Ships, armaments,\r\nand modes of attack and defence are, and will be, increasingly different.\r\nThose who have read Nelson’s private letters and journals will remember\r\nhow he gloried in the appreciation of his subordinate officers just before\r\nTrafalgar’s happy and yet fatal day, when he had explained to them his\r\nintention to attack the enemy with what was practically a wedge-formed\r\nfleet. He was determined to break their line, and, Nelson-like, he did.\r\nBut that which he facetiously christened the “Nelson touch” would itself\r\nnowadays be broken up in a few minutes and thrown into utter confusion by\r\nany powerfully-armed vessel hovering about under steam. Or if the wedge of\r\nwooden vessels were allowed to form, as they approached the apex, a couple\r\nof ironclads would take them in hand coolly, one by one, and send them to\r\nthe bottom, while their guns might as well shoot peas at the ironclads as\r\nthe shot of former days.\r\n\r\nTaking the _Victory_ as a fair type of the best war-ships of her day (a\r\nday when there was not that painful uncertainty with regard to naval\r\nconstruction and armament existing now, in spite of our vaunted progress),\r\nwe still know that in the presence of a powerful steam-frigate with heavy\r\nguns, or an 11,000-ton ironclad, she would be literally nowhere. She was\r\none of the last specimens, and a very perfect specimen, too, of the\r\n_wooden_ age. This is the age of iron and steam. One of the largest\r\nvessels of her day, she is now excelled by hundreds employed in ordinary\r\ncommerce. The Royal Navy to-day possesses frigates nearly three times her\r\ntonnage, while we have ironclads of five times the same. The monster\r\n_Great Eastern_, which has proved a monstrous mistake, is 22,500 tons.\r\n\r\nBut size is by no means the only consideration in constructing vessels of\r\nwar, and, indeed, there are good reasons to believe that, in the end,\r\nvessels of moderate dimensions will be preferred for most purposes of\r\nactual warfare. Of the advantages of steam-power there can, of course, be\r\nonly one opinion; but as regards iron _versus_ oak, there are many points\r\nwhich may be urged in favour of either, with a preponderance in favour of\r\nthe former. A strong iron ship, strange as it may appear, is not more than\r\nhalf the weight of a wooden vessel of the same size and class. It will, to\r\nthe unthinking, seem absurd to say that an iron ship is more buoyant than\r\none of oak, but the fact is that the proportion of actual weight in iron\r\nand wooden vessels of ordinary construction is about six to twenty. The\r\niron ship, therefore, stands high out of the water, and to sink it to the\r\nsame line will require a greater weight on board. From this fact, and the\r\nactual _thinness_ of its walls, its carrying capacity and stowage are so\r\nmuch the greater. This, which is a great point in vessels destined for\r\ncommerce, would be equally important in war. But these remarks do not\r\napply to the modern armoured vessel. We have ironclads with plates\r\neighteen inches and upwards in thickness. What is the consequence? Their\r\nactual weight, with that of the necessary engines and monster guns\r\nemployed, is so great that a vast deal of room on board has to be\r\nunemployed. Day by day we hear of fresh experiments in gunnery, which keep\r\npace with the increased strength of the vessels. The invulnerable of\r\nto-day is the vulnerable of to-morrow, and there are many leading\r\nauthorities who believe in a return to a smaller and weaker class of\r\nvessel—provided, however, with all the appliances for great speed and\r\noffensive warfare _at a distance_. Nelson’s preference for small,\r\neasily-worked frigates over the great ships of the line is well known, and\r\nwere he alive to-day we can well believe that he would prefer a\r\nmedium-sized vessel of strong construction, to steam with great speed, and\r\ncarrying heavy, but, perhaps, not the heaviest guns, to one of those\r\nmodern unwieldy masses of iron, which have had, so far, a most disastrous\r\nhistory. The former might, so to speak, act while the latter was making up\r\nher mind. Even a Nelson might hesitate to risk a vessel representing six\r\nor seven hundred thousand pounds of the nation’s money, in anything short\r\nof an assured success. We have, however, yet to learn the full value and\r\npower of our ironclad fleet. Of its cost there is not a doubt. Some time\r\nago our leading newspaper estimated the expense of construction and\r\nmaintenance of our existing ironclads at £18,000,000. Mr. Reed states that\r\nthey have cost the country a million sterling per annum since the first\r\norganisation of the fleet. Warfare will soon become a luxury only for the\r\nrichest nations, and, regarding it in this light, perhaps the very men who\r\nare racking their powers of invention to discover terrible engines of war\r\nare the greatest peacemakers, after all. They may succeed in making it an\r\nimpossibility.\r\n\r\n“Hereafter, naval powers prepared with the necessary fleet will be able to\r\ntransport the base of operations to any point on the enemy’s coast, turn\r\nthe strongest positions, and baffle the best-arranged combinations. Thanks\r\nto steam, the sea has become a means of communication more certain and\r\nmore simple than the land; and fleets will be able to act the part of\r\nmovable bases of operations, rendering them very formidable to powers\r\nwhich, possessing coasts, will not have any navy sufficiently powerful to\r\ncause their being respected.”(9) So far as navy to navy is concerned, this\r\nis undoubtedly true; yet there is another side to the question. A fort is\r\nsometimes able to inflict far greater damage upon its naval assailants\r\nthan the latter can inflict upon it. A single shot may send a ship to the\r\nbottom, whilst the fire from the ship during action is more or less\r\ninaccurate. At Sebastopol, a whole French fleet, firing at ranges of 1,600\r\nto 1,800 yards, failed to make any great impression on a fort close to the\r\nwater’s edge; while a wretched earthen battery, mounting only five guns,\r\ninflicted terrible losses and injury on four powerful English men-of-war,\r\nactually disabling two of them, without itself losing one man or having a\r\ngun dismounted; while, as has been often calculated, the cost of a single\r\nsloop of war with its equipment will construct a fine fort which will last\r\nalmost for ever, while that of two or three line-of-battle ships would\r\nraise a considerable fortress. Whilst the monster ironclad with heavy guns\r\nwould deal out death and destruction when surrounded by an enemy’s fleet\r\nof lighter iron vessels or wooden ones as strong as was the _Victory_, she\r\nwould herself run great risk in approaching closely-fortified harbours and\r\ncoasts, where a single shot from a gun heavy enough to pierce her armour\r\nmight sink her. Her safety would consist in firing at long ranges and in\r\nsteaming backwards and forwards.\r\n\r\nThe lessons of the Crimean war, as regards the navy, were few, but of the\r\ngravest importance, and they have led to results of which we cannot yet\r\ndetermine the end. The war opened by a Russian attack on a Turkish\r\nsquadron at Sinope, November 20th, 1853.(10) That determined the fact that\r\na whole fleet might be annihilated in an hour or so by the use of large\r\nshells. No more necessity for grappling and close quarters; the iron age\r\nwas full in view, and wooden walls had outlived their usefulness, and must\r\nperish.\r\n\r\nBut the lesson had to be again impressed, and that upon a large English\r\nand French fleet. Yet, in fairness to our navy, it must be remembered that\r\nthe Russians had spent every attention to rendering Sebastopol nearly\r\nimpregnable on the sea-side, while a distinguished writer,(11) who was\r\npresent throughout the siege, assures us that until the preceding spring\r\nthey had been quite indifferent in regard to the strength of the\r\nfortifications on the land-side. And the presence of the allied fleets was\r\nthe undeniable cause of one Russian fleet being sunk in the harbour of\r\nSebastopol, while another dared not venture out, season after season, from\r\nbehind stone fortresses in the shallow waters of Cronstadt.(12) A great\r\nnaval authority thinks that, while England was, at the time, almost\r\ntotally deficient in the class of vessels essential to attacking the\r\nfleets and fortifications of Russia, the fact that the former never dared\r\n“to accept the challenge of any British squadron, however small, is one\r\nthe record of which we certainly may read without shame.” But of that\r\nperiod it would be more pleasant to write exultingly than apologetically.\r\n\r\nWhen the Allies had decided to commence the bombardment of Sebastopol, on\r\nOctober 17th, 1854, it was understood that the fleet should co-operate,\r\nand that the attack should be made by the line-of-battle ships in a\r\nsemicircle. They were ready at one p.m. to commence the bombardment. Lyons\r\nbrought the _Agamemnon_, followed by half a dozen other vessels, to within\r\n700 yards of Fort Constantine, the others staying at the safer distances\r\nof 1,800 to 2,200 yards. The whole fleet opened with a tremendous roar of\r\nartillery, to which the Russians replied almost as heavily. Fort\r\nConstantine was several times silenced, and greatly damaged; but, on the\r\nother hand, the Russians managed to kill forty-seven and wound 234 men in\r\nthe English fleet, and a slightly smaller number in the French. They had\r\nan unpleasant knack of firing red-hot shot in profusion, and of hitting\r\nthe vessels even at the distance at which they lay. Several were set on\r\nfire, and two for a time had to retire from the action. These were\r\npractical shots at our wooden walls. This naval attack has been\r\ncharacterised as “even a greater failure than that by land”—meaning, of\r\ncourse, the first attack.\r\n\r\nHere we may for a moment be allowed to digress and remind the reader of\r\nthe important part played by red-hot shot at that greatest of all great\r\nsieges—Gibraltar. As each accession to the enemy’s force arrived, General\r\nElliott calmly built more furnaces and more grates for heating his most\r\neffective means of defence. Just as one of their wooden batteries was on\r\nthe point of completion, he gave it what was termed at the time a dose of\r\n“cayenne pepper;” in other words, with red-hot shot and shells he set it\r\non fire. When the ordnance portable furnaces for heating shot proved\r\ninsufficient to supply the demands of the artillery, he ordered large\r\nbonfires to be kindled, on which the cannon-balls were thrown; and these\r\nsupplies were termed by the soldiers “hot potatoes” for the enemy. But the\r\ngreat triumph of red-hot shot was on that memorable 13th of September,\r\n1782, when forty-six sail of the line, and a countless fleet of gun and\r\nmortar boats attacked the fortress. With all these appliances of warfare,\r\nthe great confidence of the enemy—or rather, combined enemies—was in their\r\nfloating batteries, planned by D’Arcon, an eminent French engineer, and\r\nwhich had cost a good half million sterling. They were supposed to be\r\nimpervious to shells or red-hot shot. After persistently firing at the\r\nfleet, Elliott started the admiral’s ship and one of the batteries\r\ncommanded by the Prince of Nassau. This was but the commencement of the\r\nend. The unwieldy leviathans could not be shifted from their moorings, and\r\nthey lay helpless and immovable, and yet dangerous to their neighbours;\r\nfor they were filled with the instruments of destruction. Early the next\r\nmorning eight of these vaunted batteries “indicated the efficacy of the\r\nred-hot defence. The light produced by the flames was nearly equal to\r\nnoonday, and greatly exposed the enemy to observation, enabling the\r\nartillery to be pointed upon them with the utmost precision. The rock and\r\nneighbouring objects are stated to have been highly illuminated by the\r\nconstant flashes of cannon and the flames of the burning ships, forming a\r\nmingled scene of sublimity and terror.”(13) “An indistinct clamour, with\r\nlamentable cries and groans, arose from all quarters.”(14)\r\n\r\nWhen 400 pieces of artillery were playing on the rock at the same moment,\r\nElliott returned the compliment with a shower of red-hot balls, bombs, and\r\ncarcases, that filled the air, with little or no intermission. The Count\r\nd’Artois had hastened from Paris to witness a capitulation. He arrived in\r\ntime to see the total destruction of the floating batteries and a large\r\npart of the combined fleet. Attempting a somewhat feeble joke, he wrote to\r\nFrance:—“_La batterie la plus effective était ma batterie de cuisine_.”\r\nElliott’s cooking-apparatus and “roasted balls” beat it all to nothing.\r\nRed-hot shot has been entirely superseded in “civilised” warfare by\r\nshells. It was usually handled much in the same way that ordinary shot and\r\nshell is to-day. Each ball was carried by two men, having between them a\r\nstrong iron frame, with a ring in the middle to hold it. There were two\r\nheavy wads, one dry and the other slightly damped, between the powder and\r\nball. At the siege of Gibraltar, however, matters were managed in a much\r\nmore rough-and-ready style. The shot was heated at furnaces and wheeled\r\noff to the guns in wheelbarrows lined with sand.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: THE SIEGE OF GIBRALTAR]\r\n\r\nThe partial failure of the navy to co-operate successfully with the\r\nland-forces, so far as bombardment was concerned, during the Crimean war,\r\nhas had much to do with the adoption of the costly ironclad floating\r\nfortresses, armed with enormously powerful guns, of the present day. The\r\nearliest form, indeed, was adopted during the above war, but not used to\r\nany great extent or advantage. The late Emperor of the French(15) saw that\r\nthe coming necessity or necessary evil would be some form of\r\nstrongly-armoured and protected floating battery that could cope with\r\nfortresses ashore, and this was the germ of the ironclad movement. The\r\nfirst batteries of this kind, used successfully at Kinburn, were otherwise\r\nunseaworthy and unmanageable, and were little more than heavily-plated and\r\nmore or less covered barges.\r\n\r\nThe two earliest European ironclads were _La Gloire_ in France and the\r\n_Warrior_ in England—the latter launched in 1860. Neither of these vessels\r\npresented any great departure from the established types of build in large\r\nships of war. The _Warrior_ is an undeniably fine, handsome-looking\r\nfrigate, masted and rigged as usual, but she and her sister-ship, the\r\n_Black Prince_, are about the only ironclads to which these remarks\r\napply—every form and variety of construction having been adopted since. As\r\nregarded size, she was considerably larger than the largest frigate or\r\nship of the line of our navy, although greatly exceeded by many ironclads\r\nsubsequently built. She is 380 feet in length, and her displacement of\r\nmore than 9,100 tons was 3,000 tons greater than that of the largest of\r\nthe wooden men-of-war she was superseding. The _Warrior_ is still among\r\nthe fastest of the iron-armoured fleet. Considered _as_ an ironclad,\r\nhowever, she is a weak example. Her armour, which protects only\r\nthree-fifths of her sides, is but four and a half inches thick, with\r\neighteen inches of (wood) backing, and five-eighths of an inch of what is\r\ntechnically called “skin-plating,” for protection inside. The remote\r\npossibility of a red-hot shot or shell falling inside has to be\r\nconsidered. Her bow and stern, rudder-head and steering-gear, would, of\r\ncourse, be the vulnerable points.\r\n\r\nFrom this small beginning—one armoured vessel—our ironclad fleet has grown\r\nwith the greatest rapidity, till it now numbers over sixty of all\r\ndenominations of vessels. The late Emperor of the French gave a great\r\nimpetus to the movement; and other foreign nations speedily following in\r\nhis wake, it clearly behoved England to be able to cope with them on their\r\nown ground, should occasion demand. Then there was the “scare” of invasion\r\nwhich took some hold of the public mind, and was exaggerated by certain\r\nportions of the press, at one period, till it assumed serious proportions.\r\nLeading journals complained that by the time the Admiralty would have one\r\nor two ironclads in commission, the French would have ten or twelve. Thus\r\nurged, the Government of the day must be excused if they made some\r\ndoubtful experiments and costly failures.\r\n\r\nBut apart from the lessons of the Crimea, and the activity and rivalry of\r\nforeign powers, attention was seriously drawn to the ironclad question by\r\nthe events of the day. It was easy to guess and theorise concerning this\r\nnew feature in warfare, but early in 1862 practical proof was afforded of\r\nits power. The naval engagement which took place in Hampton Roads, near\r\nthe outset of the great American civil war, was the first time in which an\r\nironclad ship was brought into collision with wooden vessels, and also the\r\nfirst time in which two distinct varieties of the species were brought\r\ninto collision with each other.\r\n\r\nThe Southerners had, when the strife commenced, seized and partially\r\nburned the _Merrimac_, a steam-frigate belonging to the United States\r\nnavy, then lying at the Norfolk Navy-yard. The hulk was regarded as nearly\r\nworthless,(16) until, looking about for ways and means to annoy their\r\nopponents, they hit on the idea of armouring her, in the best manner\r\nattainable at the moment; and for awhile at least, this condemned wreck,\r\nresuscitated, patched up, and covered with iron plates,(17) became the\r\nterror of the enemy. She was provided with an iron prow or ram capable of\r\ninflicting a severe blow under water. Her hull, cut down to within three\r\nfeet of the water-line, was covered by a bomb-proof, sloping-roofed house,\r\nwhich extended over the screw and rudder. This was built of oak and pine,\r\ncovered with iron; the latter being four and a half inches thick, and the\r\nformer aggregating twenty inches in thickness. While the hull was\r\ngenerally iron-plated, the bow and stern were covered with steel. There\r\nwere no masts—nothing seen above but the “smoke-stack” (funnel),\r\npilot-house, and flagstaff. She carried eight powerful guns, most of them\r\neleven-inch. “As she came ploughing through the water,” wrote one\r\neyewitness of her movements, “she looked like a huge half-submerged\r\ncrocodile.” The Southerners re-christened her the _Virginia_, but her\r\nolder name has clung to her. The smaller vessels with her contributed\r\nlittle to the issue of the fight, but those opposed to her were of no\r\ninconsiderable size. The _Congress_, _Cumberland_, _Minnesota_, and\r\n_Roanoake_ were frigates carrying an aggregate of over 150 guns and nearly\r\n2,000 men. They, however, were wooden vessels; and although, in two cases\r\nin particular, defended with persistent heroism, had no chance against the\r\nironclad, hastily as she had been prepared. There is little doubt that the\r\nofficers of the two former vessels, in particular, knew something of the\r\nnature of the “forlorn hope” in which they were about to engage, when she\r\nhove in sight on that memorable 8th of March, 1862. It is said that the\r\nsailors, however, derided her till she was close upon them—so close that\r\ntheir laughter and remarks were heard on board. “That Southern Bugaboo,”\r\n“that old Secesh curiosity,” were among the milder titles applied to her.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: THE ORIGINAL “MERRIMAC.”]\r\n\r\nThe engagement was fought in the Hampton Roads, which is virtually an\r\noutlet of the James River, Virginia. The latter, like the Thames, has\r\nconsiderable breadth and many shallows near its mouth. The _Merrimac_ left\r\nNorfolk Navy-yard (which holds to the James River somewhat the position\r\nthat Sheerness does to the Thames) hurriedly on the morning of the 8th,\r\nand steamed steadily towards the enemy’s fleet, accompanied by some\r\nsmaller vessels of war and a few tug-boats.\r\n\r\n  “Meanwhile, the shapeless iron mass\r\n      Came moving o’er the wave,\r\n  As gloomy as a passing hearse,\r\n      As silent as the grave.”\r\n\r\nThe morning was still and calm as that of a Sabbath-day. That the\r\n_Merrimac_ was not expected was evidenced by the boats at the booms, and\r\nthe sailors’ clothes still hanging in the rigging of the enemy’s vessels.\r\n“Did they see the long, dark hull? Had they made it out? Was it ignorance,\r\napathy, or composure that made them so indifferent? or were they provided\r\nwith torpedoes, which could sink even the _Merrimac_ in a minute?” were\r\nquestions mooted on the Southern side by those watching on board the boats\r\nand from the shore.\r\n\r\nAs soon, however, as she was plainly discerned, the crews of the\r\n_Cumberland_, _Congress_, and other vessels were beat to quarters, and\r\npreparations made for the fight. “The engagement,” wrote the Confederate\r\nSecretary of the Navy, “commenced at half-past three p.m., and at four\r\np.m. Captain Buchanan had sunk the _Cumberland_, captured and burned the\r\n_Congress_, disabled and driven the _Minnesota_ ashore, and defeated the\r\n_St. Lawrence_ and _Roanoake_, which sought shelter under the guns of\r\nFortress Monroe. Two of the enemy’s small steamers were blown up, and the\r\ntwo transport steamers were captured.” This, as will be seen, must, as\r\nregards time, be taken _cum grano salis_, but in its main points is\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nThe _Merrimac_ commenced the action by discharging a broadside at the\r\n_Congress_, one shell from which killed or disabled a number of men at the\r\nguns, and then kept on towards the _Cumberland_, which she approached with\r\nfull steam on, striking her on the port side near the bow, her stem\r\nknocking two of the ports into one, and her ram striking the vessel under\r\nthe water-line. Almost instantaneously a large shell was discharged from\r\nher forward gun, which raked the gun-deck of the doomed ship, and killed\r\nten men. Five minutes later the ship began to sink by the head, a large\r\nhole having been made by the point of the ram, through which the water\r\nrushed in. As the _Merrimac_ rounded and rapidly came up again, she once\r\nmore raked the _Cumberland_, killing or wounding sixteen more men.\r\nMeantime the latter was endeavouring to defend herself, and poured\r\nbroadside after broadside into the _Merrimac_; but the balls, as one of\r\nthe survivors tells us, bounced “upon her mailed sides like india-rubber,\r\napparently making not the least impression except to cut off her\r\nflagstaff, and thus bring down the Confederate colours. None of her crew\r\nventured at that time on her outside to replace them, and she fought\r\nthenceforward with only her pennant flying.”(18) Shortly after this, the\r\n_Merrimac_ again attacked the unfortunate ship, advancing with her\r\ngreatest speed, her ram making another hole below the water-line. The\r\n_Cumberland_ began to fill rapidly. The scene on board is hardly to be\r\ndescribed in words. It was one of horrible desperation and fruitless\r\nheroism. The decks were slippery with human gore; shreds of human flesh,\r\nand portions of the body, arms, legs, and headless trunks were scattered\r\neverywhere. Below, the cockpit was filled with wounded, whom it would be\r\nimpossible to succour, for the ship was sinking fast. Meantime the men\r\nstuck to their posts, powder was still served out, and the firing kept up\r\nsteadily, several of the crew lingering so long in the after shell-room,\r\nin their eagerness to pass up shell, that they were drowned there. The\r\nwater had now reached the main gun-deck, and it became evident that the\r\ncontest was nearly over. Still the men lingered, anxious for one last\r\nshot, when their guns were nearly under water.\r\n\r\n  “Shall we give them a broadside, my boys, as she goes?\r\n      Shall we send yet another to tell,\r\n  In iron-tongued words, to Columbia’s foes,\r\n      How bravely her sons say ‘Farewell?’”\r\n\r\nThe word was passed for each man to save himself. Even then, one man, an\r\nactive little fellow, named Matthew Tenney, whose courage had been\r\nconspicuous during the action, determined to fire once more, the next gun\r\nto his own being then under water, the vessel going down by the head. He\r\nsucceeded, but at the cost of his life, for immediately afterwards,\r\nattempting to scramble out of the port-hole, the water suddenly rushed in\r\nwith such force that he was washed back and drowned. Scores of poor\r\nfellows were unable to reach the upper deck, and were carried down with\r\nthe vessel. The _Cumberland_ sank in water up to the cross-trees, and went\r\ndown _with her flag still flying from the peak_.(19) The whole number lost\r\nwas not less than 120 souls. Her top-masts, with the pennant flying far\r\nabove the water, long marked the locality of one of the bravest and most\r\ndesperate defences ever made\r\n\r\n  “By men who knew that all else was wrong\r\n      But to die when a sailor ought.”\r\n\r\nThe _Cumberland_ being utterly demolished, the _Merrimac_ turned her\r\nattention to the _Congress_. The Southerners showed their chivalric\r\ninstincts at this juncture by not firing on the boats, or on a small\r\nsteamer, which were engaged in picking up the survivors of the\r\n_Cumberland’s_ crew. The officers of the _Congress_, seeing the fate of\r\nthe _Cumberland_, determined that the _Merrimac_ should not, at least,\r\nsink their vessel. They therefore got all sail on the ship, and attempted\r\nto run ashore. The _Merrimac_ was soon close on them, and delivered a\r\nbroadside, which was terribly destructive, a shell killing, at one of the\r\nguns, every man engaged except one. Backing, and then returning several\r\ntimes, she delivered broadside after broadside at less than 100 yards’\r\ndistance. The _Congress_ replied manfully and obstinately, but with little\r\neffect. One shot is supposed to have entered one of the ironclad’s\r\nport-holes, and dismounted a gun, as there was no further firing from that\r\nport, and a few splinters of iron were struck off her sloping mailed roof,\r\nbut this was all. The guns of the _Merrimac_ appeared to have been\r\nspecially trained on the after-magazine of the _Congress_, and shot after\r\nshot entered that part of the ship. Thus, slowly drifting down with the\r\ncurrent, and again steaming up, the _Merrimac_ continued for an hour to\r\nfire into her opponent. Several times the _Congress_ was on fire, but the\r\nflames were kept under. At length the ship was on fire in so many places,\r\nand the flames gathering with such force, that it was hopeless and\r\nsuicidal to keep up the defence any longer. The national flag was sadly\r\nand sorrowfully hauled down, and a white flag hoisted at the peak. The\r\n_Merrimac_ did not for a few minutes see this token of surrender, and\r\ncontinued to fire. At last, however, it was discerned through the clouds\r\nof smoke, and the broadsides ceased. A tug that had followed the\r\n_Merrimac_ out of Norfolk then came alongside the _Congress_, and ordered\r\nthe officers on board. This they refused, hoping that, from the nearness\r\nof the shore, they would be able to escape. Some of the men, to the\r\nnumber, it is believed, of about forty, thought the tug was one of the\r\nNorthern (Federal) vessels, and rushed on board, and were, of course, soon\r\ncarried off as prisoners. By the time that all the able men were off\r\nashore and elsewhere, it was seven o’clock in the evening, and the\r\n_Congress_ was a bright sheet of flame fore and aft, her guns, which were\r\nloaded and trained, going off as the fire reached them. A shell from one\r\nstruck a sloop at some distance, and blew her up. At midnight the fire\r\nreached her magazines, containing five tons of gunpowder, and, with a\r\nterrific explosion, her charred remains blew up. Thus had the _Merrimac_\r\nsunk one and burned a second of the largest of the vessels of the enemy.\r\n\r\nHaving settled the fate of these two ships, the _Merrimac_ had, about 5\r\no’clock in the afternoon, started to tackle the _Minnesota_. Here, as was\r\nafterwards proved, the commander of the former had the intention of\r\ncapturing the latter as a prize, and had no wish to destroy her. He,\r\ntherefore, stood off about a mile distant, and with the _Yorktown_ and\r\n_Jamestown_, threw shot and shell at the frigate, doing it considerable\r\ndamage, and killing six men. One shell entered near her waist, passed\r\nthrough the chief engineer’s room, knocking two rooms into one, and\r\nwounded several men; a shot passed through the main-mast. At nightfall the\r\n_Merrimac_, satisfied with her afternoon’s work of death and destruction,\r\nsteamed in under Sewall’s Point. “The day,” said the Baltimore _American_,\r\n“thus closed most dismally for our side, and with the most gloomy\r\napprehensions of what would occur the next day. The _Minnesota_ was at the\r\nmercy of the _Merrimac_, and there appeared no reason why the iron monster\r\nmight not clear the Roads of our fleet, destroy all the stores and\r\nwarehouses on the beach, drive our troops into the fortress, and command\r\nHampton Roads against any number of wooden vessels the Government might\r\nsend there. Saturday was a terribly dismal night at Fortress Monroe.”\r\n\r\nBut about nine o’clock that evening Ericsson’s battery, the _Monitor_,(20)\r\narrived in Hampton Roads, and hope revived in the breasts of the\r\ndespondent Northerners. She was not a very formidable-looking craft, for,\r\nlying low on the water, with a plain structure amidships, a small\r\npilot-house forward, and a diminutive funnel aft, she might have been\r\ntaken for a raft. It was only on board that her real strength might be\r\ndiscovered. She carried armour about five inches thick over a large part\r\nof her, and had practically two hulls, the lower of which had sides\r\ninclining at an angle of 51° from the vertical line. It was considered\r\nthat no shot could hurt this lower hull, on account of the angle at which\r\nit must strike it. The revolving turret, an iron cylinder, nine feet high,\r\nand twenty feet in diameter, eight or nine inches thick everywhere, and\r\nabout the portholes eleven inches, was moved round by steam-power. When\r\nthe two heavy Dahlgren guns were run in for loading, a kind of pendulum\r\nport fell over the holes in the turret. The propeller, rudder, and even\r\nanchor, were all hidden.\r\n\r\nThis was a war of surprises and sudden changes. It is doubtful if the\r\nSoutherners knew what to make of the strange-looking battery which steamed\r\ntowards them next morning, or whether they despised it. The _Merrimac_ and\r\nthe _Monitor_ kept on approaching each other, the former waiting until she\r\nwould choose her distance, and the latter apparently not knowing what to\r\nmake of her queer-looking antagonist. The first shot from the _Monitor_\r\nwas fired when about one hundred yards distant from the _Merrimac_, and\r\nthis distance was subsequently reduced to fifty yards; and at no time\r\nduring the furious cannonading that ensued were the vessels more than two\r\nhundred yards apart. The scene was in plain view from Fortress Monroe, and\r\nin the main facts all the spectators agree. At first the fight was very\r\nfurious, and the guns of the _Monitor_ were fired rapidly. The latter\r\ncarried only two guns, to its opponent’s eight, and received two or three\r\nshots for every one she gave. Finding that she was much more formidable\r\nthan she looked, the _Merrimac_ attempted to run her down; but her\r\nsuperior speed and quicker handling enabled her to dodge and turn rapidly.\r\n“Once the _Merrimac_ struck her near midships, but only to prove that the\r\nbattery could not be run down nor shot down. She spun round like a top;\r\nand as she got her bearing again, sent one of her formidable missiles into\r\nher huge opponent.\r\n\r\n“The officers of the _Monitor_ at this time had gained such confidence in\r\nthe impregnability of their battery that they no longer fired at random\r\nnor hastily. The fight then assumed its most interesting aspect. The\r\n_Monitor_ went round the _Merrimac_ repeatedly, probing her sides, seeking\r\nfor weak points, and reserving her fire with coolness, until she had the\r\nright spot and the right range, and made her experiments accordingly. In\r\nthis way the _Merrimac_ received three shots.... Neither of these three\r\nshots rebounded at all, but appeared to cut their way clear through iron\r\nand wood into the ship.”(21) Soon after receiving the third shot, the\r\n_Merrimac_ made off at full speed, and the contest was not renewed. Thus\r\nended this particular episode of the American war.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN THE “MERRIMAC” AND “MONITOR.”]\r\n\r\nLieutenant Worden was in the pilot-house of the _Monitor_ when the\r\n_Merrimac_ directed a whole broadside at her, and was, besides being\r\nthrown down and stunned by the concussion, temporarily blinded by the\r\nminute fragments of shells and powder driven through the eye-holes—only an\r\ninch each in diameter—made through the iron to enable them to keep a\r\nlook-out. He was carried away, but, on recovering consciousness, his first\r\nthoughts reverted to the action. “Have I saved the _Minnesota_?” said he,\r\neagerly. “Yes; and whipped the _Merrimac_!” was the answer. “Then,”\r\nreplied he, “I don’t care what becomes of me.” The concussion in the\r\nturret is described as something terrible; and several of the men, though\r\nnot otherwise hurt, were rendered insensible for the time. Each side\r\nclaimed that they had seriously damaged the other, but there seems to have\r\nbeen no foundation for these assertions in facts.\r\n\r\nBut although this, the original _Monitor_, was efficient, if not\r\nomnipotent, in the calm waters at the mouth of the James River, she was,\r\nas might be expected with her flat, barge-like bottom, a bad sea-boat, and\r\nwas afterwards lost. Her ports had to be closed and caulked, being only\r\nfive feet above the water, and she was therefore unable to work her guns\r\nat sea. Her constructor had neglected Sir Walter Raleigh’s advice to\r\nPrince Henry touching the model of a ship, “that her ports be so laid, as\r\nthat she may carry out her guns all weathers.” She plunged\r\nheavily—completely submerging her pilot-house at times, the sea washing\r\nover and into her turret. The heavy shocks and jars of the armour, as it\r\ncame down upon the waves, made her leaky, and she went to the bottom in\r\nspite of pumps capable of throwing 2,000 gallons a minute, which were in\r\ngood order and working incessantly.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE PERUVIAN IRONCLAD _HUASCAR_ ATTACKED BY TWO CHILIAN\r\n                               IRONCLADS.]\r\n\r\nSince the conclusion of the American war, the ironclad question has\r\nassumed serious aspects, and many facts could be cited to show that they\r\nhave not by any means always confirmed the first impressions of their\r\nstrength and invulnerability. Two recent cases will be fresh in the\r\nmemories of our readers. The first is the recent engagement off Peru\r\nbetween the Peruvian ironclad turret-ship _Huascar_ and the British\r\nunarmoured men-of-war _Shah_ and _Amethyst_. With the political aspect of\r\nthe affair we have nothing, of course, to do, in our present work. It was\r\nreally a question between the guns quite as much as between the vessels.\r\nThe _Huascar_ is only a moderately-strong armoured vessel, her plates\r\nbeing the same thickness as those of the earliest English ironclad, the\r\n_Warrior_, and her armament is two 300-pounders in her turret, and three\r\nshell-guns. On the other hand, the _Shah_, the principal one of the two\r\nBritish vessels, is only a large iron vessel sheathed in wood, and not\r\narmoured at all; but she carries, besides smaller guns, a formidable\r\narmament in the shape of two 12-ton and sixteen 6½-ton guns. An eyewitness\r\nof the engagement states(22) that, after three hours’ firing, at a\r\ndistance of from 400 to 3,000 yards, the only damage inflicted by the\r\nopposing vessels was a hole in the _Huascar’s_ side, made by a shell, the\r\nbursting of which killed one man. “One 9-in. shot (from a 12-ton gun) also\r\npenetrated three inches into the turret without effecting any material\r\ndamage. There were nearly 100 dents of various depths in the plates, but\r\nnone of sufficient depth to materially injure them. The upper works—boats,\r\nand everything destructible by shell—were, of course, destroyed. Her\r\ncolours were also shot down.” According to theory, the _Shah’s_ two larger\r\nguns should have penetrated the _Huascar’s_ sides when fired at upwards of\r\n3,000 yards’ distance. The facts are very different, doubtless because the\r\nshots struck the armour obliquely, at any angles but right ones. The\r\n_Huascar_ was admirably handled and manœuvred, but her gunnery was so\r\nindifferent that none of the shots even struck the _Shah_, except to cut\r\naway a couple of ropes, and the latter kept up so hot a fire of shells\r\nthat the crew of the former were completely demoralised, and the officers\r\nhad to train and fire the guns. She eventually escaped to Iquique, under\r\ncover of a pitchy-dark night. The same correspondent admits, however, that\r\nthe _Shah_, although a magnificent vessel, is not fitted for the South\r\nAmerican station, since Peru has three ironclads, Chili two, and Brazil\r\nand the River Plate Republics several, against which no ordinary English\r\nman-of-war could cope, were the former properly handled.\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: THE PERUVIAN IRONCLAD _HUASCAR_.]\r\n\r\nThe recent story of the saucy Russian merchantman,(23) which not merely\r\ndared the Turkish ironclad, but fought her for five hours, and inflicted\r\nquite as much damage as she received, will also be remembered, although it\r\nmay be taken just for what it is worth. One Captain Baranoff, of the\r\nImperial Russian Navy, had, in an article published in the _Golos_, of St.\r\nPetersburg, recommended his Government to abandon ironclads, avoid naval\r\nbattles, and confine operations at sea to the letting loose of a number of\r\ncruisers against the enemy’s merchantmen. Where a naval engagement was\r\ninevitable, he “preferred fighting with small craft, making up by agility\r\nand speed what they lacked in cuirass, and if the worst came to the worst,\r\neasily replaced by other specimens of the same type.” The article created\r\nmuch notice; and at the beginning of the present war, the author was given\r\nto understand by the Russian Admiralty that he should have an opportunity\r\nof proving his theories by deeds. The _Vesta_, an ordinary iron steamer of\r\nlight build, was selected; she had been employed previously in no more\r\nwarlike functions than the conveyance of corn and tallow from Russia to\r\nforeign ports. She was equipped immediately with a few 6-in. mortars, her\r\ndecks being strengthened to receive them, but no other changes were made.\r\nOn the morning of the 23rd of July, cruising in the Black Sea, Captain\r\nBaranoff encountered the Turkish ironclad _Assari Tefvik_, a formidable\r\nvessel armoured with twelve inches of iron, and carrying 12-ton guns, and\r\nnothing daunted by the disproportion in size and strength, immediately\r\nengaged her. Both vessels were skilfully manœuvred, the ironclad moving\r\nabout with extraordinary alertness and speed. She was only hit three times\r\nwith large balls; the second went through her deck, “kindling a fire which\r\nwas quickly extinguished;” the third was believed to have injured the\r\nturret. Meantime, the _Vesta_ was herself badly injured, a grenade hitting\r\nher close to the powder-magazine, which would have soon blown up but for\r\nthe rapid measures taken by her commander. Her rudder was struck and\r\npartially disabled, but still she was not sunk, as she should have been,\r\naccording to all theoretical considerations. She eventually steamed back\r\nagain to Sebastopol—after two other vessels had come to the ironclad’s\r\nassistance—covered with glory, having for five hours worried, and somewhat\r\ninjured, a giant vessel to which, in proportion, she was but a weak and\r\nmiserable dwarf.\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious that from neither of the above cases can any positive\r\ninferences be safely drawn. In the former case, the weaker vessel had the\r\nstronger guns, and so matters were partially balanced; in the second\r\nexample, the ironclad ought to have easily sunk the merchantman by means\r\nof her heavy guns, even from a great distance—but she didn’t. The ironclad\r\nquestion will engage our attention again, as it will, we fear, that of the\r\nnation, for a very long time to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MEN OF PEACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Naval Life in Peace Times—A Grand Exploring Voyage—The Cruise of\r\n         the _Challenger_—Its Work—Deep-sea Soundings—Five Miles\r\n            Down—Apparatus Employed—Ocean Treasures—A Gigantic\r\n       Sea-monster—Tristan d’Acunha—A Discovery Interesting to the\r\n       Discovered—The Two Crusoes—The Inaccessible Island—Solitary\r\n     Life—The Sea-cart—Swimming Pigs—Rescued at Last—The Real Crusoe\r\n      Island to Let—Down South—The Land of Desolation—Kerguelen—The\r\n        Sealers’ Dreary Life—In the Antarctic—Among the Icebergs.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo form of life presents greater contrasts than that of the sailor. Storm\r\nand calm alternate; to-day in the thick of the fight—battling man or the\r\nelements—to-morrow we find him tranquilly pursuing some peaceful scheme of\r\ndiscovery or exploration, or calmly cruising from one station to another,\r\nprotecting by moral influence alone the interests of his country. His\r\ndeeds may be none the less heroic because his conquests are peaceful, and\r\nbecause Neptune rather than Mars is challenged to cede his treasures.\r\nAnson, Cook, and Vancouver, Parry, Franklin, M’Clintock, and M’Clure,\r\namong a host of others, stand worthily by the side of our fighting\r\nsailors, because made of the same stuff. Let us also, then, for a time,\r\nleave behind the smoke and din, the glories and horrors of war, and cool\r\nour fevered imaginations by descending, in spirit at least, to the depths\r\nof the great sea. The records of the famous voyage of the _Challenger_(24)\r\nwill afford a capital opportunity of contrasting the deeds of the men of\r\npeace with those of men of war.\r\n\r\nWe may commence by saying that no such voyage has in truth ever been\r\nundertaken before.(25) Nearly 70,000 miles of the earth’s watery surface\r\nwere traversed, and the Atlantic and Pacific crossed and recrossed several\r\ntimes. It was a veritable _voyage en zigzag_. Apart from ordinary\r\nsoundings innumerable, 374 deep-sea soundings, when the progress of the\r\nvessel had to be stopped, and which occupied an hour or two apiece, were\r\nmade, and at least two-thirds as many successful dredgings and trawlings.\r\nThe greatest depth of ocean reached was 4,575 fathoms (27,450 feet), or\r\n_over five miles_. This was in the Pacific, about 1,400 miles S.E. of\r\nJapan. We all know that this ocean derives its name from its generally\r\ncalmer weather and less tempestuous seas; and the researches of the\r\nofficers of the _Challenger_, and of the United States vessel _Tuscarora_,\r\nshow that the bottom slopes to its greatest depths very evenly and\r\ngradually, little broken by submarine mountain ranges, except off volcanic\r\nislands and coasts like those of the Hawaiian (Sandwich) Islands. Off the\r\nlatter there are mountains in the sea ranging to as high as 12,000 feet.\r\nThe general evenness of the bottom helps to account for the long, sweeping\r\nwaves of the Pacific, so distinguishable from the short, cut-up, and\r\n“choppy” waves of the Atlantic. In the Atlantic, on the voyage of the\r\n_Challenger_ from Teneriffe to St. Thomas, a pretty level bottom off the\r\nAfrican coast gradually deepened till it reached 3,125 fathoms (over three\r\nand a half miles), at about one-third of the way across to the West\r\nIndies. If the Alps, Mont Blanc and all, were submerged at this spot,\r\nthere would still be more than half a mile of water above them! Five\r\nhundred miles further west there is a comparatively shallow part—two miles\r\nor so deep—which afterwards deepens to three miles, and continues at the\r\nsame depth nearly as far as the West Indies.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: EXAMINING A “HAUL” ON BOARD THE “CHALLENGER.”]\r\n\r\nA few words as to the work laid out for the _Challenger_, and how she did\r\nit. She is a 2,000-ton corvette, of moderate steam-power, and was put into\r\ncommission, with a reduced complement of officers and men, Captain (now\r\nSir) George S. Nares, later the commander of the Arctic expedition, having\r\ncomplete charge and control. Her work was to include soundings,\r\nthermometric and magnetic observations, dredgings and chemical\r\nexaminations of sea-water, the surveying of unsurveyed harbours and\r\ncoasts, and the resurveying, where practicable, of partially surveyed\r\ncoasts. The (civil) scientific corps, under the charge of Professor\r\nWyville Thomson, comprised three naturalists, a chemist and physicist, and\r\na photographer. The naturalists had their special rooms, the chemist his\r\nlaboratory, the photographer his “dark-room,” and the surveyors their\r\nchart-room, to make room for which all the guns were removed except two.\r\nOn the upper deck was another analysing-room, “devoted to mud, fish,\r\nbirds, and vertebrates generally;” a donkey-engine for hauling in the\r\nsounding, dredging, and other lines, and a broad bridge amidships, from\r\nwhich the officer for the day gave the necessary orders for the\r\nperformance of the many duties connected with their scientific labours.\r\nThousands of fathoms of rope of all sizes, for dredging and sounding; tons\r\nof sounding-weights, from half to a whole hundredweight apiece; dozens of\r\nthermometers for deep-sea temperatures, and gallons of methylated spirits\r\nfor preserving the specimens obtained, were carried on board.\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: THE “ACCUMULATOR.”]\r\n\r\nSteam-power is always very essential to deep-sea sounding. No trustworthy\r\nresults can be obtained from a ship under sail; a perpendicular sounding\r\nis the one thing required, and, of course, with steam the vessel can be\r\nkept head to the wind, regulating her speed so that she remains nearly\r\nstationary. The sounding apparatus used needs some little description. A\r\nblock was fixed to the main-yard, from which depended the “accumulator,”\r\nconsisting of strong india-rubber bands, each three-fourths of an inch in\r\ndiameter and three feet long, which ran through circular discs of wood at\r\neither end. These are capable of stretching seventeen feet, and their\r\nobject is to prevent sudden strain on the lead-line from the inevitable\r\njerks and motion of the vessel. The sounding-rod used for great depths is,\r\nwith its weights,(26) so arranged that on touching bottom a spring\r\nreleases a wire sling, and the weights slip off and are left there. These\r\nrods were only employed when the depths were considered to be over 1,500\r\nfathoms; for less depths a long, conical lead weight was used, with a\r\n“butterfly valve,” or trap, at its basis for securing specimens from the\r\nocean bed. There are several kinds of “slip” water-bottles for securing\r\nsamples of sea-water (and marine objects of small size floating in it) at\r\ngreat depths. One of the most ingenious is a brass tube, two and a half\r\nfeet in length, fitted with easily-working stop-cocks at each end,\r\nconnected by means of a rod, on which is a movable float. As the bottle\r\ndescends the stop-cocks must remain open, but as it is hauled up again the\r\nflat float receives the opposing pressure of the water above it, and,\r\nacting by means of the connecting-rod, shuts both cocks simultaneously,\r\nthus inclosing a specimen of the water at that particular depth.\r\nSelf-registering thermometers were employed, sometimes attached at\r\nintervals of 100 fathoms to the sounding-line, so as to test the\r\ntemperatures at various depths. For dredging, bags or nets from three to\r\nfive feet in depth, and nine to fifteen inches in width, attached to iron\r\nframes, were employed, whilst at the bottom of the bags a number of\r\n“swabs,” similar to those used in cleaning decks, were attached, so as to\r\nsweep along the bottom, and bring up small specimens of animal life—coral,\r\nsponges, &c. These swabs were, however, always termed “hempen tangles”—so\r\nmuch does science dignify every object it touches! The dredges were\r\nafterwards set aside for the ordinary beam-trawls used in shallow water\r\naround our own coasts. Their open meshes allowed the mud and sand to\r\nfilter through easily, and their adoption was a source of satisfaction to\r\nsome of the officers who looked with horror on the state of their usually\r\nimmaculate decks, when the dredges were emptied of their contents.\r\n\r\nNot so very long ago, our knowledge of anything beneath the ocean’s\r\nsurface was extremely indefinite; for even of the coasts and shallows we\r\nknew little, marine zoology and botany being the last, and not the\r\nearliest, branches of natural history investigated by men of science. It\r\nwas asserted that the specific gravity of water at great depths would\r\ncause the heaviest weights to remain suspended in mid-sea, and that animal\r\nexistence was impossible at the bottom. When, some sixteen years ago, a\r\nfew star-fish were brought up by a line from a depth of 1,200 fathoms, it\r\nwas seriously considered that they had attached themselves at some midway\r\npoint, and not at the bottom. In 1868-9-70, the Royal Society borrowed\r\nfrom the Admiralty two of Her Majesty’s vessels, the _Lightning_ and\r\n_Porcupine_; and in one of the latter’s trips, considerably to the south\r\nand west of Ireland, she sounded to a depth of 2,400 fathoms,(27) and was\r\nvery successful in many dredging operations. As a result, it was then\r\nsuggested that a vessel should be specially fitted out for a more\r\nimportant ocean voyage round the world, to occupy three or more years, and\r\nthe cruise of the _Challenger_ was then determined upon.\r\n\r\nThe story of that cruise is utterly unsensational; it is one simply of\r\ncalm and unremitting scientific work, almost unaccompanied by peril. To\r\nsome the treasures acquired will seem valueless. Among the earliest gains,\r\nobtained near Cape St. Vincent, with a common trawl, was a beautiful\r\nspecimen of the Euplectella, “glass-rope sponge,” or “Venus’s\r\nflower-basket,” alive. This object of beauty and interest, sometimes seen\r\nin working naturalists’ and conchologists’ windows in London, had always\r\npreviously been obtained from the seas of the Philippine Islands and\r\nJapan, to which it was thought to be confined, and its discovery so much\r\nnearer home was hailed with delight. It has a most graceful form,\r\nconsisting of a slightly curved conical tube, eight or ten inches in\r\nheight, contracted beneath to a blunt point. The walls are of light\r\ntracery, resembling opaque spun glass, covered with a lace-work of\r\ndelicate pattern. The lower end is surrounded by an upturned fringe of\r\nlustrous fibres, and the wider end is closed by a lid of open network.\r\nThese beautiful objects of nature make most charming ornaments for a\r\ndrawing-room, but have to be kept under a glass case, as they are somewhat\r\nfrail. In their native element they lie buried in the mud. They were\r\nafterwards found to be “the most characteristic inhabitants of the great\r\ndepths all over the world.” Early in the voyage, no lack of living things\r\nwere brought up—strange-looking fish, with their eyes blown nearly out of\r\ntheir heads by the expansion of the air in their air-bladders, whilst\r\nentangled among the meshes were many star-fish and delicate zoophytes,\r\nshining with a vivid phosphorescent light. A rare specimen of the\r\nclustered sea-polyp, twelve gigantic polyps, each with eight long fringed\r\narms, terminating in a close cluster on a stalk or stem three feet high,\r\nwas obtained. “Two specimens of this fine species were brought from the\r\ncoast of Greenland early in the last century; somehow these were lost, and\r\nfor a century the animal was never seen.” Two were brought home by one of\r\nthe Swedish Arctic expeditions, and these are the only specimens ever\r\nobtained. One of the lions of the expedition was not “a rare sea-fowl,”\r\nbut a transparent lobster, while a new crustacean, perfectly blind, which\r\nfeels its way with most beautifully delicate claws, was one of the\r\ngreatest curiosities obtained. Of these wonders, and of some geological\r\npoints determined, more anon. But they did not even sight the sea-serpent,\r\nmuch less attempt to catch it. Jules Verne’s twenty miles of inexhaustible\r\npearl-meadows were evidently missed, nor did they even catch a glimpse of\r\nhis gigantic oyster, with the pearl as big as a cocoa-nut, and worth\r\n10,000,000 francs. They could not, with Captain Nemo, dive to the bottom\r\nand land amid submarine forests, where tigers and cobras have their\r\ncounterparts in enormous sharks and vicious cephalopods. Victor Hugo’s\r\n“devil-fish” did not attack a single sailor, nor did, indeed, any\r\nformidable cuttle-fish take even a passing peep at the _Challenger_, much\r\nless attempt to stop its progress. Does the reader remember the story\r\nrecited both by Figuier and Moquin Tandon,(28) concerning one of these\r\ngigantic sea-monsters, which should have a strong basis of truth in it, as\r\nit was laid before the French Académie des Sciences by a lieutenant of\r\ntheir navy and a French consul?\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: OBJECTS OF INTEREST BROUGHT HOME BY THE “CHALLENGER.”\r\n Fig. 1.—Shell of _Globigerina_ (highly magnified). Fig. 2.—_Ophioglypha\r\n  bullata_ (six times the size in nature). Fig. 3.—_Euplectella Suberea_\r\n (popularly “Venus’s Flower-basket”).

The head was of enormous\r\nsize, out of all proportion to the body, and had eyes as large as plates.\r\nThe other extremity terminated in two fleshy lobes or fins of great size.\r\nThe estimated weight of the whole creature was 4,000 lbs., and the flesh\r\nwas soft, glutinous, and of a reddish-brick colour. “The commandant,\r\nwishing, in the interests of science, to secure the monster, actually\r\nengaged it in battle. Numerous shots were aimed at it, but the balls\r\ntraversed its flaccid and glutinous mass without causing it any vital\r\ninjury. But after one of these attacks, the waves were observed to be\r\ncovered with foam and blood, and—singular thing—a strong odour of musk was\r\ninhaled by the spectators.... The musket-shots not having produced the\r\ndesired results, harpoons were employed, but they took no hold on the\r\nsoft, impalpable flesh of the marine monster. When it escaped from the\r\nharpoon, it dived under the ship and came up again at the other side. They\r\nsucceeded, at last, in getting the harpoon to bite, and in passing a\r\nbowling-hitch round the posterior part of the animal. But when they\r\nattempted to hoist it out of the water, the rope penetrated deeply into\r\nthe flesh, and separated it into two parts, the head, with the arms and\r\ntentacles, dropping into the sea and making off, while the fins and\r\nposterior parts were brought on board; they weighed about forty pounds.\r\nThe crew were eager to pursue, and would have launched a boat, but the\r\ncommander refused, fearing that the animal might capsize it. The object\r\nwas not, in his opinion, one in which he could risk the lives of his\r\ncrew.” M. Moquin Tandon, commenting on M. Berthelot’s recital, considers\r\n“that this colossal mollusc was sick and exhausted at the time by some\r\nrecent struggle with some other monster of the deep, which would account\r\nfor its having quitted its native rocks in the depths of the ocean.\r\nOtherwise it would have been more active in its movements, or it would\r\nhave obscured the waves with the inky liquid which all the cephalopods\r\nhave at command. Judging from its size, it would carry at least a barrel\r\nof this black liquid.”\r\n\r\nThe _Challenger_ afterwards visited Juan Fernandez, the real Robinson\r\nCrusoe island where Alexander Selkirk passed his enforced residence of\r\nfour years. Thanks to Defoe, he lived to find himself so famous, that he\r\ncould hardly have grudged the time spent in his solitary sojourn with his\r\ndumb companions and man Friday. Alas! the romance which enveloped Juan\r\nFernandez has somewhat dimmed. For a brief time it was a Chilian penal\r\ncolony, and after sundry vicissitudes, was a few years ago leased to a\r\nmerchant, who kept cattle to sell to whalers and passing ships, and also\r\nwent seal-hunting on a neighbouring islet. He was “monarch of all he\r\nsurveyed”—lord of an island over a dozen miles long and five or six broad,\r\nwith cattle, and herds of wild goats, and capital fishing all round—all\r\nfor two hundred a year! Fancy this, ye sportsmen, who pay as much or more\r\nfor the privileges of a barren moor! Yet the merchant was not satisfied\r\nwith his venture, and, at the time of the _Challenger’s_ visit, was on the\r\npoint of abandoning it: by this time it is probably to let. Excepting the\r\ncattle dotted about the foot of the hills and a civilised house or two,\r\nthe appearance of the island must be precisely the same now as when the\r\npiratical buccaneers of olden time made it their rendezvous and haunt\r\nwherefrom to dash out and harry the Spaniards; the same to-day as when\r\nAlexander Selkirk lived in it as its involuntary monarch; the same to-day\r\nas when Commodore Anson arrived with his scurvy-stricken “crazy ship, a\r\ngreat scarcity of water, and a crew so universally diseased that there\r\nwere not above ten foremast-men in a watch capable of doing duty,” and\r\nrecruited them with fresh meat, vegetables, and wild fruits.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: THE “CHALLENGER” AT JUAN FERNANDEZ.]\r\n\r\n“The scenery,” writes Lord George Campbell, “is grand: gloomy and wild\r\nenough on the dull, stormy day on which we arrived, clouds driving past\r\nand enveloping the highest ridge of the mountain, a dark-coloured sea\r\npelting against the steep cliffs and shores, and clouds of sea-birds\r\nswaying in great flocks to and fro over the water; but cheerful and\r\nbeautiful on the bright sunny morning which followed—so beautiful that I\r\nthought, ‘This beats Tahiti!’” The anchorage of the _Challenger_ was in\r\nCumberland Bay, a deep-water inlet from which rises a semi-circle of high\r\nland, with two bold headlands, “sweeping brokenly up thence to the highest\r\nridge—a square-shaped, craggy, precipitous mass of rock, with trees\r\nclinging to its sides to near the summit. The spurs of these hills are\r\ncovered with coarse grass or moss.... Down the beds of the small ravines\r\nrun burns, overgrown by dock-leaves of enormous size, and the banks are\r\nclothed with a rich vegetation of dark-leaved myrtle, bignonia, and\r\nwinter-bark, tree-shrubs, with tall grass, ferns, and flowering plants.\r\nAnd as you lie there, humming-birds come darting and thrumming within\r\nreach of your stick, flitting from flower to flower, which dot blue and\r\nwhite the foliage of bignonias and myrtles. And on the steep grassy slopes\r\nabove the sea-cliffs herds of wild goats are seen quietly\r\nbrowsing—quietly, that is, till they scent you, when they are off—as wild\r\nas chamois.” This is indeed a description of a rugged paradise!\r\n\r\nNear the ship they found splendid, but laborious, cod-fishing; laborious\r\non account of sharks playing with the bait, and treating the stoutest\r\nlines as though made of single gut; also on account of the forty-fathom\r\ndepth these cod-fish lived in. Cray-fish and conger-eels were hauled up in\r\nlobster-pots by dozens, while round the ship’s sides flashed shoals of\r\ncavalli, fish that are caught by a hook with a piece of worsted tied\r\nroughly on, swished over the surface, giving splendid play with a rod.\r\n“And on shore, too, there was something to be seen and done. There was\r\nSelkirk’s ‘look-out’ to clamber up the hill-side to—the spot where\r\ntradition says he watched day after day for a passing sail, and from\r\nwhence he could look down on both sides of his island home, over the\r\nwooded slopes, down to the cliff-fringed shore, on to the deserted ocean’s\r\nexpanse.”\r\n\r\nThe _Challenger_, in its cruise of over three years, naturally visited\r\nmany oft-described ports and settlements with which we shall have nought\r\nto do. After a visit to Kerguelen’s Land—“the Land of Desolation,” as\r\nCaptain Cook called it—in the Southern Indian Ocean, for the purpose of\r\nselecting a spot for the erection of an observatory, from whence the\r\ntransit of Venus should be later observed, they proceeded to Heard Island,\r\nthe position of which required determining with more accuracy. They\r\nanchored, in the evening, in a bay of this most gloomy and utterly\r\ndesolate place, where they found half-a-dozen wretched sealers living in\r\ntwo miserable huts near the beach, which were sunk into the ground for\r\nwarmth and protection against the fierce winds. Their work is to kill and\r\nboil down sea-elephants. One of the men had been there for two years, and\r\nwas going to stay another. They are left on the island every year by the\r\nschooners, which go sealing or whaling elsewhere. Some forty men were on\r\nthe island, unable to communicate with each other by land, as the interior\r\nis entirely covered with glacier, like Greenland. They have barrels of\r\nsalt pork, beef, and a small store of coals, and little else, and are\r\nwretchedly paid. “Books,” says Lord Campbell, “tell us that these\r\nsea-elephants grow to the length of twenty-four feet; but the sealers did\r\nnot confirm this at all. One of us tried hard to make the Scotch mate say\r\nhe had seen one eighteen feet long; but ‘waull, he couldn’t say.’ Sixteen\r\nfeet? ‘Waull, he couldn’t say.’ Fourteen feet? ‘Waull, yes, yes—something\r\nmore like that;’ but thirteen feet would seem a fair average size.... One\r\nof our fellows bought a clever little clay model of two men killing a\r\nsea-elephant, giving for it—he being an extravagant man—one pound and a\r\nbottle of rum. This pound was instantly offered to the servants outside in\r\nexchange for another bottle.”\r\n\r\nCrossing the Antarctic Circle, they were soon among the icebergs, keeping\r\na sharp look-out for Termination Land, which has been marked on charts as\r\na good stretch of coast seen by Wilkes, of the American expedition, thirty\r\nyears before. To make a long story short, Captain Nares, after a careful\r\nsearch, _un-discovered_ this discovery, finding no traces of the land. It\r\nwas probably a long stretch of ice, or possibly a _mirage_, which\r\nphenomenon has deceived many a sailor before. John Ross once thought that\r\nhe had discovered some grand mountains in the Arctic regions, which he\r\nnamed after the then First Lord of the Admiralty, Croker. Next year Parry\r\nsailed over the site of the supposed range; and the “Croker” Mountains\r\nbecame a standing joke against Ross.\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: “THE CHALLENGER” IN ANTARCTIC ICE.]\r\n\r\nIcebergs of enormous size were encountered; several of three _miles_ in\r\nlength and two hundred feet or more in height were seen one day, all close\r\ntogether. But bergs of this calibre were exceptional; they were, however,\r\nvery often over half a mile in length. “There are few people now alive,”\r\nsays the author we have recently quoted, “who have seen such superb\r\nAntarctic iceberg scenery as we have. We are steaming towards the supposed\r\nposition of land, only some thirty miles distant, over a glass-like sea,\r\nunruffled by a breath of wind; past great masses of ice, grouped so close\r\ntogether in some cases as to form an unbroken wall of cliff several miles\r\nin length. Then, as we pass within a few hundred yards, the chain breaks\r\nup into two or three separate bergs, and one sees—and beautifully from the\r\nmast-head—the blue sea and distant horizon between perpendicular walls of\r\nglistening alabaster white, against which the long swell dashes, rearing\r\nup in great blue-green heaps, falling back in a torrent of\r\nrainbow-flashing spray, or goes roaring into the azure caverns, followed\r\nimmediately by a thundering _thud_, as the compressed air within buffets\r\nit back again in a torrent of seething white foam.” Neither words\r\nadequately describe the beauty of many of the icebergs seen. One had three\r\nhigh arched caverns penetrating far to its interior; another had a large\r\ntunnel through which they could see the horizon. The delicate colouring of\r\nthese bergs is most lovely—sweeps of azure blue and pale sea-green with\r\ndazzling white; glittering, sparkling crystal merging into depths of\r\nindigo blue; stalactite icicles hanging from the walls and roofs of\r\ncavernous openings. The reader will imagine the beauty of the scene at\r\nsunrise and sunset, when as many as eighty or ninety bergs were sometimes\r\nin sight. The sea was intensely green from the presence of minute algæ,\r\nthrough belts of which the vessel passed, while the sun, sinking in a\r\ngolden blaze, tipped and lighted up the ice and snow, making them sparkle\r\nas with brightest gems. A large number of tabular icebergs, with\r\nquantities of snow on their level tops, were met. They amused themselves\r\nby firing a 9-pounder Armstrong at one, which brought the ice down with a\r\nrattling crash, the face of the berg cracking, splitting, and splashing\r\ndown with a roar, making the water below white with foam and powdered ice.\r\nThese icebergs were all stratified, at more or less regular distances,\r\nwith blue lines, which before they capsized or canted from displacement of\r\ntheir centres of gravity, were always horizontal. During a gale, the\r\n_Challenger_ came into collision with a berg, and lost her jibboom,\r\n“dolphin-striker,” and other head-gear. An iceberg in a fog or gale of\r\nwind is not a desirable obstruction to meet at sea.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: THE _CHALLENGER_ MADE FAST TO ST. PAUL’S ROCKS (SOUTH\r\n                               ATLANTIC).]\r\n\r\nThe observations made for deep-sea temperatures gave some remarkable\r\nresults. Here, among the icebergs, a band or stratum of water was found,\r\nat a depth of eighty to 200 fathoms, _colder_ than the water either above\r\nor below it. Take one day as an example: on the 19th of February the\r\nsurface temperature of the sea-water was 32°; at 100 fathoms it was 29·2°;\r\nwhile at 300 fathoms it had risen to 33°. In the Atlantic, on the eastern\r\nside about the tropics, the _bottom_ temperature was found to be very\r\nuniform at 35·2°, while it might be broiling hot on the surface. Further\r\nsouth, on the west side of the Atlantic below the equator, the bottom was\r\nfound to be very nearly three degrees cooler. It is believed that the cold\r\ncurrent enters the Atlantic from the Antarctic, and does not rise to\r\nwithin 1,700 fathoms of the surface. These, and many kindred points,\r\nbelong more properly to another section of this work, to be hereafter\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: THE NATURALIST’S ROOM ON BOARD THE “CHALLENGER.”]\r\n\r\nThe _Challenger_ had crossed, and sounded, and dredged the broad Atlantic\r\nfrom Madeira to the West Indies—finding their deepest water off the Virgin\r\nIslands; thence to Halifax, Nova Scotia; recrossed it to the Azores,\r\nCanary, and Cape de Verde Islands; recrossed it once more in a great\r\nzig-zag from the African coast, through the equatorial regions to Bahia,\r\nBrazil; and thence, if the expression may be used, by a great angular\r\nsweep through the Southern Ocean to Tristan d’Acunha _en route_ to the\r\nCape, where they made an interesting discovery, one that, unlike their\r\nother findings, was most interesting to the _discovered_ also. It was that\r\nof _two_ modern Robinson Crusoes, who had been living by themselves a\r\ncouple of years on a desolate rocky island, the name of which,\r\n“Inaccessible,” rightly describes its character and position in mid ocean.\r\nJuan Fernandez, the _locale_ of Defoe’s immortal story, is nothing to it\r\nnow-a-days, and is constantly visited. On arrival at the island of Tristan\r\nd’Acunha, itself a miserable settlement of about a dozen cottages, the\r\npeople, mostly from the Cape and St. Helena, some of them mulattoes,\r\ninformed the officers of the _Challenger_ that two Germans, brothers, had\r\nsome time before settled, for the purpose of catching seals, on a small\r\nisland about thirty miles off, and that, not having been over there or\r\nseen any signs of them for a long time, they feared that they had\r\nperished. It turned out afterwards that the Tristan d’Acunha people had\r\nnot taken any trouble in the matter, looking on them as interlopers on\r\ntheir fishing-grounds. They had promised to send them some animals—a bull,\r\ncow, and heifer—but, although they had stock and fowls of all kinds, had\r\nleft them to their fate. But first as to this little-known Tristan\r\nd’Acunha, of which Lord George Campbell(29) furnishes the following\r\naccount:—“It is a circular-shaped island, some nine miles in diameter, a\r\npeak rising in the centre 8,300 feet high—a fine sight, snow-covered as it\r\nis two-thirds of the way down. In the time of Napoleon a guard of our\r\nmarines was sent there from the Cape; but the connection between Nap’s\r\nbeing caged at St. Helena and a guard of marines occupying this island is\r\nnot very obvious, is it? Any way, that was the commencement of a\r\nsettlement which has continued with varying numbers to this day, the\r\nmarines having long ago been withdrawn, and now eighty-six people—men,\r\nwomen, and children—live here.... A precipitous wall of cliff, rising\r\nabruptly from the sea, encircles the island, excepting where the\r\nsettlement is, and there the cliff recedes and leaves a long grass slope\r\nof considerable extent, covered with grey boulders. The cottages, in\r\nnumber about a dozen, look very Scotch from the ship, with their white\r\nwalls, straw roofs, and stone dykes around them. Sheep, cattle, pigs,\r\ngeese, ducks, and fowls they have in plenty, also potatoes and other\r\nvegetables, all of which they sell to whalers, who give them flour or\r\nmoney in exchange. The appearance of the place makes one shudder; it looks\r\nso thoroughly as though it were always blowing there—which, indeed, it is,\r\nheavy storms continually sweeping over, killing their cattle right and\r\nleft before they have time to drive them under shelter. They say that they\r\nhave lost 100 head of cattle lately by these storms, which kill the\r\nanimals, particularly the calves, from sheer fatigue.” The men of the\r\nplace often go whaling or sealing cruises with the ships that touch there.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: DREDGING IMPLEMENTS USED BY THE “CHALLENGER.”\r\n Fig. 1, Sounding machines. Fig. 2, Slip water-bottles. Fig. 3, Deep-sea\r\n       thermometer. Fig. 4, The dredge. Fig. 5, Cup sounding lead.]\r\n\r\nThe _Challenger_ steamed slowly over to Inaccessible Island during the\r\nnight, and anchored next morning off its northern side, where rose a\r\nmagnificent wall of black cliff, splashed green with moss and ferns,\r\nrising sheer 1,300 feet above the sea. Between two headlands a strip of\r\nstony beach, with a small hut on it, could be seen. This was the residence\r\nof our two Crusoes.\r\n\r\nTheir story, told when the first exuberance of joy at the prospect of\r\nbeing taken off the island had passed away, was as follows:—One of the\r\nbrothers had been cast away on Tristan d’Acunha some years before, in\r\nconsequence of the burning of his ship. There he and his companions of the\r\ncrew had been kindly treated by the settlers, and told that at one of the\r\nneighbouring islands 1,700 seals had been captured in one season. Telling\r\nthis to a brother when he at last reached home in the Fatherland, the two\r\nof them, fired with the ambition of acquiring money quickly, determined to\r\nexile themselves for a while to the islands. By taking passage on an\r\noutward-bound steamer from Southampton, and later transferring themselves\r\nto a whaler, they reached their destination in safety on the 27th of\r\nNovember, 1871. They had purchased an old whale-boat—mast, sails, and oars\r\ncomplete—and landed with a fair supply of flour, biscuit, coffee, tea,\r\nsugar, salt, and tobacco, sufficient for present needs. They had blankets\r\nand some covers, which were easily filled with bird’s feathers—a German\r\ncould hardly forget his national luxury, his feather-bed. They had\r\nprovided themselves with a wheelbarrow, sundry tools, pot and kettles; a\r\nshort Enfield rifle, and an old fowling-piece, and a very limited supply\r\nof powder, bullets, and shot. They had also sensibly provided themselves\r\nwith some seeds, so that, all in all, they started life on the island\r\nunder favourable circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe west side of the island, on which they landed, consisted of a beach\r\nsome three miles in length, with a bank of earth, covered with the strong\r\nlong tussock grass, rising to the cliff, which it was just possible to\r\nscale. The walls of rock by which the island is bounded afforded few\r\nopportunities for reaching the comparatively level plateau at the top.\r\nWithout the aid of the grass it was impossible, and in one place, which\r\nhad to be climbed constantly, it took them an hour and a half of hard\r\nlabour, holding on with hands and feet, and _even teeth_, to reach the\r\nsummit. Meantime, they had found on the north side a suitable place for\r\nbuilding their hut, near a waterfall that fell from the side of the\r\nmountain, and close to a wood, from which they could obtain all the\r\nfirewood they required. Their humble dwelling was partly constructed of\r\nspars from the vessel that had brought them to the island, and was\r\nthatched with grass. About this time (December) the seals were landing in\r\nthe coast, it being the pupping season, and they killed nineteen. In\r\nhunting them their whale-boat, which was too heavy for two men to handle,\r\nwas seriously damaged in landing through the surf; but yet, with constant\r\nbailing, could be kept afloat. A little later they cut it in halves, and\r\nconstructed from the best parts a smaller boat, which was christened the\r\n_Sea Cart_. During the summer rains their house became so leaky that they\r\npulled it down, and shifted their quarters to another spot. At the\r\nbeginning of April the tussock grass, by which they had ascended the\r\ncliff, caught fire, and their means of reaching game, in the shape of wild\r\npigs and goats, was cut off. Winter (about our summer-time, as in\r\nAustralia, &c.) was approaching, and it became imperative to think of\r\nlaying in provisions. By means of the _Sea Cart_ they went round to the\r\nwest side, and succeeded in killing two goats and a pig, the latter of\r\nwhich furnished a bucket of fat for frying potatoes. The wild boars there\r\nwere found to be almost uneatable; but the sows were good eating. The\r\ngoats’ flesh was said to be very delicate. An English ship passed them far\r\nout at sea, and they lighted a fire to attract attention, but in vain;\r\nwhile the surf was running too high, and their _Cart_ too shaky to attempt\r\nto reach it.\r\n\r\nHitherto they had experienced no greater hardships than they had expected,\r\nand were prepared for. But in June [mid-winter] their boat was, during a\r\nstorm, washed off the beach, and broken up. This was to them a terrible\r\ndisaster; their old supplies were exhausted, and they were practically cut\r\noff from not merely the world in general, but even the rest of the island.\r\nThey got weaker and weaker, and by August were little better than two\r\nskeletons.\r\n\r\nThe sea was too tempestuous, and the distance too great for them to\r\nattempt to swim round (as they afterwards did) to another part of the\r\nisland. But succour was at hand; they were saved by the penguins, a very\r\nclumsy form of relief. The female birds came ashore in August to lay their\r\neggs in the nests already prepared by their lords and masters, the male\r\nbirds, who had landed some two or three weeks previously. Our good Germans\r\nhad divided their last potato, and were in a very weak and despondent\r\ncondition when the pleasant fact stared them in the face that they might\r\nnow fatten on eggs _ad libitum_. Their new diet soon put fresh heart and\r\ncourage in them, and when, early in September, a French bark sent a boat\r\nashore, they determined still to remain on the island. They arranged with\r\nthe captain for the sale of their seal-skins, and bartered a quantity of\r\neggs for some biscuit and a couple of pounds of tobacco. Late in October a\r\nschooner from the Cape of Good Hope called at the island, and on leaving,\r\npromised to return for them, as they had decided to quit the island, not\r\nhaving had any success in obtaining peltries or anything else that is\r\nvaluable; but she did not re-appear, and in November their supplies were\r\nagain at starvation-point. Selecting a calm day, the two Crusoes\r\ndetermined to swim round the headland to the eastward, taking with them\r\ntheir rifles and blankets, and towing after them an empty oil-barrel\r\ncontaining their clothes, powder, matches, and kettle. This they repeated\r\nlater on several occasions, and, climbing the cliffs by the tussock grass,\r\nwere able to kill or secure on the plateau a few of the wild pigs.\r\nSometimes one of them only would mount, and after killing a pig would cut\r\nit up and lower the hams to his brother below. They caught three little\r\nsucking-pigs, and towed them alive through the waves, round the point of\r\ntheir landing-place, where they arrived half drowned. They were put in an\r\nenclosure, and fed on green stuff and penguin’s eggs—good feeding for a\r\ndelicate little porker. Attempting on another occasion to tow a couple in\r\nthe same way, the unfortunate pigs met a watery grave in the endeavour to\r\nweather the point, and one of the brothers barely escaped, with some few\r\ninjuries, through a terrible surf which was beating on their part of the\r\ncoast. Part of their time was passed in a cave during the cold weather.\r\nWhen the _Challenger_ arrived their only rifle had burst in two places,\r\nand was of little use, while their musket was completely burst in all\r\ndirections, and was being used as a blow-pipe to freshen the fire when it\r\ngot low. Their only knives had been made by themselves from an old saw.\r\nTheir library consisted of eight books and an atlas, and these, affording\r\ntheir only literary recreation for two years, they knew almost literally\r\nby heart. When they first landed they had a dog and two pups, which they,\r\ndoubtless, hoped would prove something like companions. The dogs almost\r\nimmediately left, and made for the penguin rookeries, where they killed\r\nand worried the birds by hundreds. One of them became mad, and the\r\nbrothers thought it best to shoot the three of them. Captain Nares gave\r\nthe two Crusoes a passage to the Cape, where one of them obtained a good\r\nsituation; the other returned to Germany, doubtless thinking that about a\r\ncouple of dozen seal-skins—all they obtained—was hardly enough to reward\r\nthem for their two years’ dreary sojourn on Inaccessible Island.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chapter III.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE MEN OF THE SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The great Lexicographer on Sailors—The Dangers of the Sea—How Boys\r\n            become Sailors—Young Amyas Leigh—The Genuine Jack\r\n      Tar—Training-Ships _versus_ the old Guard-Ships—“Sea-goers and\r\n      Waisters”—The Training Undergone—Routine on Board—Never-ending\r\n    Work—Ship like a Lady’s Watch—Watches and “Bells”—Old Grogram and\r\n     Grog—The Sailor’s Sheet Anchor—Shadows in the Seaman’s Life—The\r\n         Naval Cat—Testimony and Opinion of a Medical Officer—An\r\n       Example—Boy Flogging in the Navy—Shakespeare and Herbert on\r\n                           Sailors and the Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson, whose personal weight seems to have had something to do with\r\nthat carried by his opinion, considered going to sea a species of\r\ninsanity.(30) “No man,” said he, “will be a sailor who has contrivance\r\nenough to get himself into a jail: for being in a ship is being in a jail,\r\nwith the chance of being drowned.” The great lexicographer knew Fleet\r\nStreet better than he did the fleet, and his opinion, as expressed above,\r\nwas hardly even decently patriotic or sensible. Had all men thought as he\r\nprofessed to do—probably for the pleasure of saying something ponderously\r\nbrilliant for the moment—we should have had no naval or commercial\r\nsuperiority to-day—in short, no England.\r\n\r\nThe dangers of the sea are serious enough, but need not be exaggerated.\r\nOne writer(31) indeed, in serio-comic vein, makes his sailors sing in a\r\ngale—\r\n\r\n  “When you and I, Bill, on the deck\r\n    Are comfortably lying,\r\n  My eyes! what tiles and chimney-pots\r\n    About their heads are flying!”\r\n\r\nleading us to infer that the dangers of town-life are greater than those\r\nof the sea in a moderate gale. We might remind the reader that Mark Twain\r\nhas conclusively shown, from statistics, that more people die in bed\r\ncomfortably at home than are killed by all the railroad, steamship, or\r\nother accidents in the world, the inference being that going to bed is a\r\ndangerous habit! But the fact is, that wherever there is danger there will\r\nbe brave men found to face it—even when it takes the desperate form just\r\nindicated! So that there is nothing surprising in the fact that in all\r\ntimes there have been men ready to go to sea.\r\n\r\nOf those who have succeeded, the larger proportion have been carried\r\nthither by the spirit of adventure. It would be difficult to say whether\r\nit has been more strongly developed through actual “surroundings,” as\r\nbelieved by one of England’s most intelligent and friendly critics,(32)\r\nwho says, “The ocean draws them just as a pond attracts young ducks,” or\r\nthrough the influence of literature bringing the knowledge of wonderful\r\nvoyages and discoveries within the reach of all. The former are immensely\r\nstrong influences. The boy who lives by, and loves the sea, and notes\r\ndaily the ships of all nations passing to and fro, or who, maybe, dwells\r\nin some naval or commercial port, and sees constantly great vessels\r\narriving and departing, and hears the tales of sailors bold, concerning\r\nnew lands and curious things, is very apt to become imbued with the spirit\r\nof adventure. How charmingly has Charles Kingsley written on the latter\r\npoint!(33) How young Amyas Leigh, gentle born, and a mere stripling\r\nschoolboy, edged his way under the elbows of the sailor men on Bideford\r\nQuay to listen to Captain John Oxenham tell his stories of heaps—“seventy\r\nfoot long, ten foot broad, and twelve foot high”—of silver bars, and\r\nSpanish treasure, and far-off lands and peoples, and easy victories over\r\nthe coward Dons! How Oxenham, on a recruiting bent, sang out, with good\r\nbroad Devon accent, “Who ’lists? who ’lists? who’ll make his fortune?\r\n\r\n  “‘Oh, who will join, jolly mariners all?\r\n  And who will join, says he, O!\r\n  To fill his pockets with the good red goold,\r\n  By sailing on the sea, O!’”\r\n\r\nAnd how young Leigh, fired with enthusiasm, made answer, boldly, “I want\r\nto go to sea; I want to see the Indies. I want to fight the Spaniards.\r\nThough I’m a gentleman’s son, I’d a deal liever be a cabin-boy on board\r\nyour ship.” And how, although he did not go with swaggering John, he lived\r\nto first round the world with great Sir Francis Drake, and after fight\r\nagainst the “Invincible” Armada. The story had long before, and has many a\r\ntime since, been enacted in various forms among all conditions of men. To\r\nsome, however, the sea has been a last refuge, and many such have been\r\nconverted into brave and hardy men, perforce themselves; while many\r\nothers, in the good old days of press-gangs, appeared, as Marryat tells\r\nus, “to fight as hard not to be forced into the service as they did for\r\nthe honour of the country after they were fairly embarked in it.” It may\r\nnot generally be known that the law which concerns impressing has never\r\nbeen abolished, although there is no fear that it will ever again be\r\nresorted to in these days of naval reserves, training-ships, and naval\r\nvolunteers.\r\n\r\nThe altered circumstances of the age, arising from the introduction of\r\nsteam, and the greatly increased inter-commercial relations of the whole\r\nworld, have made the Jack Tar pure and simple comparatively rare in these\r\ndays; not, we believe, so much from his disappearance off the scene as by\r\nthe numbers of differently employed men on board by whom he is surrounded,\r\nand in a sense hidden. A few A.B.’s and ordinary seamen are required on\r\nany steamship; but the whole tribe of mechanicians, from the important\r\nrank of chief engineer downwards, from assistants to stokers and\r\ncoal-passers, need not know one rope from another. On the other hand, the\r\nrapid increase of commerce has apparently outrun the natural increase of\r\nqualified seamen, and many a good ship nowadays, we are sorry to say, goes\r\nto sea with a very motley crew of “green” hands, landlubbers, and\r\nforeigners of all nationalities, including Lascars, Malays, and Kanakas,\r\nfrom the Sandwich Islands. A “confusion of tongues,” not very desirable on\r\nboard a vessel, reigns supreme, and renders the position of the officers\r\nby no means enviable. To obviate these difficulties, and furnish a supply\r\nof good material both to the Royal Navy and Mercantile Marine,\r\ntraining-ships have been organised, which have been, so far, highly\r\nsuccessful. Let these embryo defenders of their country’s interests have\r\nthe first place.\r\n\r\nOf course, at all periods the boys, and others who entered to serve before\r\nthe mast, received some training, and picked up the rest if they were\r\nreasonably clever. The brochure of “an old salt,”(34) which has recently\r\nappeared, gives a fair account of his own treatment and reception. Running\r\naway from London, as many another boy has done, with a few coppers in his\r\npocket, he tramped to Sheerness, taking by the way a hearty supper of\r\nturnips with a family of sheep in a field. Arrived at his destination, he\r\nfound a handsome flag-ship, surrounded by a number of large and small\r\nvessels. Selecting the very smallest—as best adapted to his own size—he\r\nwent on board, and asked the first officer he met—one who wore but a\r\nsingle epaulet—whether his ship was “_manned__ with boys_?” He was\r\nanswered, “No, I want men; and pray what may you want?” “I want to go to\r\nsea, sir, please.” “You had better go home to your mother,” was the\r\nanswer. With the next officer—“a real captain, wearing grey hair, and as\r\nstraight as a line”—he fared better, and was eventually entered as a\r\nthird-class boy, and sent on board a guard-ship. Here he was rather\r\nfortunate in being taken in charge by a petty officer, who had, as was\r\noften the case then, his wife living on board. The lady ruled supreme in\r\nthe mess. She served out the grog, too, and, to prevent intoxication among\r\nthe men, used to keep one finger inside the measure! This enabled her to\r\nthe better take care of her husband. She is described as the best “man” in\r\nthe mess, and irresistibly reminds us of Mrs. Trotter in “Peter Simple,”\r\nwho had such a horror of rum that she could not be induced to take it\r\nexcept when the water was bad. The water, however, always _was_ bad! But\r\nthe former lady took good care of the new-comer, while, as we know, Mrs.\r\nTrotter fleeced poor Peter out of three pounds sterling and twelve pairs\r\nof stockings before he had been an hour on board. Mr. Mindry tells the\r\nusual stories of the practical jokes he had to endure—about being sent to\r\nthe doctor’s mate for mustard, for which he received a peppering; of the\r\nconstant thrashings he received—in one case, with a number of others,\r\nreceiving two dozen for _losing his dinner_. He was cook of the mess for\r\nthe time, and having mixed his dough, had taken it to the galley-oven,\r\nfrom the door of which a sudden lurch of the ship had ejected it on the\r\nmain deck, “the contents making a very good representation of the White\r\nSea.” The crime for which he and his companions suffered was for\r\nendeavouring to scrape it up again! But the gradual steps by which he was\r\neducated upwards, till he became a gunner of the first class, prove that,\r\nall in all, he had cheerily taken the bull by the horns, determined to\r\nrise as far and fast as he might in an honourable profession. He was after\r\na year or so transferred to a vessel fitting for the West Indies, and soon\r\ngot a taste of active life. This was in 1837. Forty or fifty years before,\r\nthe guard-ships were generally little better than floating pandemoniums.\r\nThey were used partly for breaking in raw hands, and were also the\r\nintermediate stopping-places for men waiting to join other ships. In a\r\nguard-ship of the period described, a most heterogeneous mass of humanity\r\nwas assembled. Human invention could not scheme work for the whole, while\r\nskulking, impracticable in other vessels of the Royal Navy, was deemed\r\nhighly meritorious there. A great body of men were thus very often\r\nassembled together, who resolved themselves into hostile classes,\r\nseparated as any two castes of the Hindoos. A clever writer in\r\n_Blackwood’s Magazine_, more than fifty years ago, describes them first as\r\n“sea-goers,”—_i.e._, sailors separated from their vessels by illness, or\r\ntemporary causes, or ordered to other vessels, who looked on the\r\nguard-ship as a floating hotel, and, having what they were pleased to call\r\n_ships of their own_, were the aristocrats of the occasion, who would do\r\nno more work than they were obliged. The second, and by far the most\r\nnumerous class, were termed “waisters,” and were the simple, the\r\nunfortunate, or the utterly abandoned, a body held on board in the utmost\r\ncontempt, and most of whom, in regard to clothing, were wretched in the\r\nextreme. The “waister” had to do everything on board that was\r\nmenial—swabbing, sweeping, and drudging generally. At night, in defiance\r\nof his hard and unceasing labour, he too often became a bandit, prowling\r\nabout seeking what he might devour or appropriate. What a contrast to the\r\nclean orderly training-ships of to-day! Some little information on this\r\nsubject, but imperfectly understood by the public, may perhaps be\r\npermitted here.\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: THE “CHICHESTER” TRAINING-SHIP.]\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known that our supply of seamen for the Royal Navy is\r\nnowadays almost entirely derived from the training-ships—first established\r\nabout fourteen years ago. In a late blue-book it was stated that during a\r\nperiod of five years only 107 men had been entered from other sources, who\r\nhad not previously served. Training-ships, accommodating about 3,000, are\r\nstationed at Devonport, Falmouth, Portsmouth, and Portland, where the lads\r\nremain for about a year previous to being sent on sea-going ships. The age\r\nof entry has varied at different periods; it is now fifteen to sixteen and\r\na half years. The recruiting statistics show whence a large proportion\r\ncome—from the men of Devon, who contribute, as they did in the days of\r\nDrake and Hawkins, Gilbert and Raleigh, the largest quota of men willing\r\nto make their “heritage the sea.”\r\n\r\nDr. Peter Comrie, R.N., a gentleman who has made this matter a study,\r\ninforms the writer that on board these ships, as regards cleanliness, few\r\ngentlemen’s sons are better attended to, while their education is not\r\nneglected, as they have a good schoolmaster on all ships of any size. He\r\nsays that boys brought up in the service not merely make the best seamen,\r\nbut generally like the navy, and stick to it. The order, cleanliness, and\r\ntidy ways obligatory on board a man-of-war, make, in many cases, the\r\nill-regulated fo’castle of most merchant ships very distasteful to them.\r\nTheir drilling is just sufficient to keep them in healthy condition. No\r\none can well imagine the difference wrought in the appearance of the\r\nstreet arab, or the Irish peasant boy, by a short residence on board one\r\nof these ships. He fills out, becomes plump, loses his gaunt, haggard,\r\nhunted look; is natty in his appearance, and assumes that jaunty, rolling\r\ngait that a person gifted with what is called “sea-legs” is supposed to\r\nexhibit. Still, “we,” writes the doctor, “have known Irish boys, who had\r\nvery rarely even perhaps seen animal food, when first put upon the liberal\r\ndietary of the service, complain that they were being starved, their\r\nstomachs having been so used to be distended with large quantities of\r\nvegetables, that it took some time before the organ accommodated itself to\r\na more nutritious but less filling dietary.”\r\n\r\nYou have only got to watch the boy from the training-ship on leave to\r\njudge that the navy has yet some popularity. Neatly dressed, clean and\r\nnatty, surrounded by his quondam playmates, he is “the observed of all\r\nobservers,” and is gazed at with admiring respect by the street arab from\r\na respectful distance. He has, perhaps, learned to “spin a few yarns,” and\r\ngive the approved hitch to his trousers, and, while giving a favourable\r\naccount of his life on board ship, with its forecastle jollity and “four\r\nbitter,” is the best recruiting-officer the service can have. The great\r\npoint to be attended to, in order to make him a sailor, is that “you must\r\ncatch him young.”(35) That a good number have been so caught is proved by\r\nthe navy estimates, which now provide for over 7,000 boys, 4,000 of the\r\nnumber in sea-going ships.\r\n\r\nGovernments, as governments, may be paternal, but are rarely very\r\nbenevolent, and the above excellent institutions are only organised for\r\nthe safety and strength of the navy. There is another class of\r\ntraining-ships, which owe their existence to benevolence, and deserve\r\nevery encouragement—those for rescuing our street waifs from the treadmill\r\nand prison. The larger part of these do not enter the navy, but are passed\r\ninto the Merchant Marine, their training being very similar. The\r\nGovernment simply _lends_ the ship. Thus the _Chichester_, at Greenhithe,\r\na vessel which had been in 1868 a quarter of a century lying\r\nuseless—_never_ having seen service—was turned over to a society, a mere\r\nshell or carcase, her masts, rigging, and other fittings having to be\r\nprovided by private subscriptions. Her case irresistibly reminds the\r\nwriter of a vessel, imaginary only in name, described by James\r\nHannay:(36)—“H.M.S. _Patagonian_ was built as a three-decker, at a cost of\r\n£120,000, when it was discovered that she could not sail. She was then cut\r\ndown into a frigate, at a cost of £50,000, when it was found out that she\r\nwould not tack. She was next built up into a two-decker, at a cost of\r\nanother £50,000, and then it was discovered she could be made useful, so\r\nthe Admiralty kept her unemployed for ten years!” A good use was, however,\r\nfound at last for the _Chichester_, thanks to benevolent people, the\r\nquality of whose mercy is twice blessed, for they both help the wretched\r\nyoungsters, and turn them into good boys for our ships. Some of these\r\nstreet arabs previously have hardly been under a roof at night for years\r\ntogether. Hear M. Esquiros:—“To these little ones London is a desert, and,\r\nthough lost in the drifting sands of the crowd, they never fail to find\r\ntheir way. The greater part of them contract a singular taste for this\r\nhard and almost savage kind of life. They love the open sky, and at night\r\nall they dread is the eye of the policeman; their young minds become\r\nfertile in resources, and glory in their independence in the ‘battle of\r\nlife;’ but if no helping hand is stretched out to arrest them in this\r\nfatal and down-hill path, they surely gravitate to the treadmill and the\r\nprison. How could it be otherwise?... The question is, what are these lads\r\ngood for?” That problem, M. Esquiros, as you with others predicted, has\r\nbeen solved satisfactorily. The poor lads form excellent raw material for\r\nour ever-increasing sea-service.\r\n\r\nThe training of a naval cadet—_i.e._, an embryo midshipman, or\r\n“midshipmite” (as poor Peter Simple was irreverently called—before,\r\nhowever, the days of naval cadets)—is very similar in many respects to\r\nthat of an embryo seaman, but includes many other acquirements. After\r\nobtaining his nomination from the Admiralty, and undergoing a simple\r\npreliminary examination at the Royal Naval College in ordinary branches of\r\nknowledge, he is passed to a training-ship, which to-day is the\r\n_Britannia_ at Dartmouth. Here he is taught all the ordinary acquirements\r\nin rigging, seamanship, and gunnery; and, to fit him to be an officer, he\r\nis instructed in taking observations for latitude and longitude, in\r\ngeometry, trigonometry, and algebra. He also goes through a course of\r\ndrawing-lessons and modern languages. He is occasionally sent off on a\r\nbrig for a short cruise, and after a year on the training-ship, during\r\nwhich he undergoes a quarterly examination, he is passed to a sea-going\r\nship. His position on leaving depends entirely on his certificate—if he\r\nobtains one of the First Class, he is immediately rated midshipman; while\r\nif he only obtains a Third Class certificate, he will have to serve twelve\r\nmonths more on the sea-going ship, and pass another examination before he\r\ncan claim that rank.(37)\r\n\r\nThe actual experiences of intelligent sailors, or voyagers, written by\r\nthemselves, have, of course, a greater practical value than the\r\nsea-stories of clever novelists, while the latter, as a class, confine\r\nthemselves very much to the quarter-deck. Dana’s “Two Years Before the\r\nMast” is so well known that few of our readers need to be told that it is\r\nthe story of an American student, who had undermined his health by\r\nover-application, and who took a voyage, _viâ_ Cape Horn, to California in\r\norder to recover it. But the old brig _Pilgrim_, bound to the northern\r\nPacific coast for a cargo of hides, was hardly a fair example, in some\r\nrespects, of an ordinary merchant-vessel, to say nothing of a fine clipper\r\nor modern steam-ship. Dana’s experiences were of the roughest type, and\r\nmay be read by boys, anxious to go to sea, with advantage, if taken in\r\nconjunction with those of others; many of them are common to all grades of\r\nsea service. A little work by a “Sailor-boy,”(38) published some years\r\nago, gives a very fair idea of a seaman’s lot in the Royal Navy, and the\r\ntwo stories in conjunction present a fair average view of sea-life and its\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nPassing over the young sailor-boy’s admission to the training-ship—the\r\n“Guardho,” as he terms it—we find his first days on board devoted to the\r\nmysteries of knots and hitch-making, in learning to lash hammocks, and in\r\nrowing, and in acquiring the arts of “feathering” and “tossing” an oar.\r\nIncidentally he gives us some information on the etiquette observed in\r\nboats passing with an officer on board. “For a lieutenant, the coxswain\r\nonly gets up and takes his cap off; for a captain, the boat’s crew lay on\r\ntheir oars, and the coxswain takes his cap off; and for an admiral the\r\noars are tossed (_i.e._, raised perpendicularly, _not_ thrown in the\r\nair!), and all caps go off.” Who would not be an admiral? While in this\r\n“instruction” he received his sailor’s clothes—a pair of blue cloth\r\ntrousers, two pairs of white duck ditto, two blue serge and two white\r\nfrocks, two pairs of white “jumpers,” two caps, two pairs of stockings, a\r\nknife, and a marking-type. As soon as he is “made a sailor” by these\r\nmeans, he was ordered to the mast-head, and tells with glee how he was\r\nable to go up outside by the futtock shrouds, and not through “lubber’s\r\nhole.” The reader doubtless knows that the lubber’s hole is an open space\r\nbetween the head of the lower mast and the edge of the top; it is so named\r\nfrom the supposition that a “land-lubber” would prefer that route. The\r\nFrench call it the _trou du chat_—the hole through which the cat would\r\nclimb. Next he commenced cutlass-drill, followed by rifle-drill, big-gun\r\npractice, instruction in splicing, and all useful knots, and in using the\r\ncompass and lead-line. He was afterwards sent on a brig for a short sea\r\ncruise. “Having,” says he, “to run aloft without shoes was a heavy trial\r\nto me, and my feet often were so sore and blistered that I have sat down\r\nin the ‘tops’ and cried with the pain; yet up I had to go, and furl and\r\nloose my sails; and up I did go, blisters and all. Sometimes the pain was\r\nso bad I could not move smartly, and then the unmerited rebuke from a\r\nthoughtless officer was as gall and wormwood to me.”\r\n\r\nDana, in speaking of the incessant work on board any vessel, says, “A ship\r\nis like a lady’s watch—always out of repair.” When, for example, in a\r\ncalm, the sails hanging loosely, the hot sun pouring down on deck, and no\r\nway on the vessel, which lies\r\n\r\n  “As idle as a painted ship\r\n  Upon a painted ocean,”\r\n\r\nthere is always sufficient work for the men, in “setting up” the rigging,\r\nwhich constantly requires lightening and repairing, in picking oakum for\r\ncaulking, in brightening up the metal-work, and in holystoning the deck.\r\nThe holystone is a large piece of porous stone,(39) which is dragged in\r\nalternate ways by two sailors over the deck, sand being used to increase\r\nits effect. It obtains its name from the fact that Sunday morning is a\r\nvery common time on many merchant-vessels for cleaning up generally.\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: INSTRUCTION ON BOARD A MAN-OF-WAR.]\r\n\r\nThe daily routine of our young sailor on the experimental cruises gave him\r\nplenty of employment. In his own words it was as follows:—Commencing at\r\nfive a.m.—“Turn hands up; holystone or scrub upper deck; coil down ropes.\r\nHalf-past six—breakfast, half an hour; call the watch, watch below, clean\r\nthe upper deck; watch on deck, clean wood and brass-work; put the upper\r\ndecks to rights. Eight a.m.—hands to quarters; clean guns and arms;\r\ndivision for inspection; prayers; make sail, reef topsails, furl\r\ntop-sails, top-gallant sails, royals; reef courses, down top-gallant and\r\nroyal yards. This continued till eight bells, twelve o’clock, dinner one\r\nhour. ‘All hands again; cutlass, rifle, and big-gun drill till four\r\no’clock; clear up decks, coil up ropes;’ and then our day’s work is done.”\r\nThen they would make little trips to sea, many of them to experience the\r\nwoes of sea-sickness for the first time.\r\n\r\nBut the boys on the clean and well-kept training-brig were better off in\r\nall respects than poor Dana. When first ordered aloft, he tells us, “I had\r\nnot got my ‘sea-legs’ on, was dreadfully sea-sick, with hardly strength to\r\nhold on to anything, and it was ‘pitch-dark’ * * * How I got along I\r\ncannot now remember. I ‘laid out’ on the yards, and held on with all my\r\nstrength. I could not have been of much service; for I remember having\r\nbeen sick several times before I left the top-sail yard. Soon all was snug\r\naloft, and we were again allowed to go below. This I did not consider much\r\nof a favour; for the confusion of everything below, and that inexpressibly\r\nsickening smell, caused by the shaking up of bilge-water in the hold, made\r\nthe steerage but an indifferent refuge to the cold, wet decks. I had often\r\nread of the nautical experiences of others, but I felt as though there\r\ncould be none worse than mine; for, in addition to every other evil, I\r\ncould not but remember that this was only the first night of a two years’\r\nvoyage. When we were all on deck, we were not much better off, for we were\r\ncontinually ordered about by the officer, who said that it was good for us\r\nto be in motion. Yet anything was better than the horrible state of things\r\nbelow. I remember very well going to the hatchway and putting my head\r\ndown, when I was oppressed by nausea, and felt like being relieved\r\nimmediately.” We can fully recommend the example of Dana, who, acting on\r\nthe advice of the black cook on board, munched away at a good half-pound\r\nof salt beef and hard biscuit, which, washed down with cold water, soon,\r\nhe says, made a man of him.\r\n\r\nSome little explanation of the mode of dividing time on board ship may be\r\nhere found useful. A “watch” is a term both for a division of the crew and\r\nof their time: a full watch is four hours. At the expiration of each four\r\nhours, commencing from twelve o’clock noon, the men below are called in\r\nthese or similar terms—“All the starboard (or port) watch ahoy! Eight\r\nbells!” The watch from four p.m. to eight p.m. is divided, on a\r\nwell-regulated ship, into two “dog-watches;” the object of this is to make\r\nan uneven number of periods—seven, instead of six, so that the men change\r\nthe order of their watches daily. Otherwise, it will be seen that a man,\r\nwho, on leaving port, stood in a particular watch—from twelve noon to four\r\np.m.—would stand in the same watch throughout the voyage; and he who had\r\ntwo night-watches at first would always have them. The periods of the\r\n“dog-watches” are usually devoted to smoking and recreation for those off\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nAs the terms involved must occur frequently in this work, it is necessary\r\nalso to explain for some readers the division of time itself by “bells.”\r\nThe limit is “eight bells,” which are struck at twelve, four, and eight\r\no’clock a.m. or p.m. The ship’s bell is sounded each half-hour. Half-past\r\nany of the above hours is “one bell” struck sharply by itself. At the\r\nhour, two strokes are made sharply _following_ each other. Expressing the\r\nstrokes by signs, half-past twelve would be | (representing one stroke);\r\none o’clock would be || (two strokes sharply struck, one after the other);\r\nhalf-past one, || |; two o’clock, || ||; half-past two, || || |; three\r\no’clock, || || ||; half-past three, || || || |; and four o’clock, || || ||\r\n||, or “eight bells.” The process is then repeated in the next watch, and\r\nthe only disturbing element comes from the elements, which occasionally,\r\nwhen the vessel rolls or pitches greatly, cause the bell to strike without\r\nleave.\r\n\r\nSeamen before the mast are divided into three classes—able, ordinary, and\r\nboys. In the merchant service a “green hand” of forty may be rated as a\r\nboy; a landsman must ship for boy’s wages on the first voyage. Merchant\r\nseamen rate themselves—in other words, they cause themselves to be entered\r\non the ship’s books according to their qualifications and experience.\r\nThere are few instances of abuse in this matter, and for good reason.\r\nApart from the disgrace and reduction of wages and rating which would\r\nfollow, woe to the man who sets himself up for an A.B. when he should\r\nenter as a boy; for the rest of the crew consider it a fraud on\r\nthemselves. The vessel would be short-handed of a man of the class\r\nrequired, and their work would be proportionately increased. No mercy\r\nwould be shown to such an impostor, and his life on board would be that of\r\na dog, but anything rather than that of a “jolly sea-dog.”(40)\r\n\r\nThere are lights in the sailor’s chequered life. Seamen are, Shakespeare\r\ntells us, “but men”—and, if we are to believe Dibdin, grog is a decided\r\nelement in their happier hours. “Grog” is now a generic term; but it was\r\nnot always. One Admiral Vernon—who persisted in wearing a grogram(41)\r\ntunic so much that he was known among his subordinates as “Old\r\nGrog”—earned immortality of a disagreeable nature by watering the\r\nrum-ration of the navy to its present standard. At 11.30 a.m., on all\r\nships of the Royal Navy nowadays, half a gill of watered rum—two parts of\r\nwater to one of the stronger drink—is served out to each of the crew,\r\nunless they have forfeited it by some act of insubordination. The\r\nofficers, including the petty officers, draw half a gill of pure rum; the\r\nformer put it into the general mess, and many never taste it. “Six-water”\r\ngrog is a mild form of punishment. “Splicing the main-brace” infers extra\r\ngrog served out for extraordinary service. Formerly, and, indeed, as late\r\nas forty odd years ago, the daily ration was a full gill; but, as sailors\r\ntraded and bartered their drinks among themselves, it would happen once in\r\nawhile that one would get too much “on board.” It has happened\r\noccasionally in consequence that a seaman has tumbled overboard, or fallen\r\nfrom the yards or rigging, and has met an inglorious death. Boys are not\r\nallowed grog in the Royal Navy, and there is no absolute rule among\r\nmerchant-vessels. In the American navy there is a coin allowance in lieu\r\nof rum, and every nation has its own peculiarities in this matter. In the\r\nFrench navy, wine, very _ordinaire_, and a little brandy is issued.\r\n\r\nThere are shadows, too, in the sailor’s life—as a rule, he brings them on\r\nhimself, but by no means always. If sailors are “but men,” officers rank\r\nin the same category, and occasionally act like brutes. So much has been\r\nwritten on the subject of the naval “cat”—a punishment once dealt out for\r\nmost trifling offences, and not abolished yet, that the writer has some\r\ndiffidence in approaching the subject. A volume might be written on the\r\ntheme; let the testimony of Dr. Stables,(42) a surgeon of the Royal Navy,\r\nsuffice. It shall be told in his own words:—\r\n\r\n“One item of duty there is, which occasionally devolves on the medical\r\nofficer, and for the most part goes greatly against the feeling of the\r\nyoung surgeon; I refer to his compulsory attendance at floggings. It is\r\nonly fair to state that the majority of captains and commanders use the\r\ncat as seldom as possible, and that, too, only sparingly. In some ships,\r\nhowever, flogging is nearly as frequent as prayers of a morning. Again, it\r\nis more common on foreign stations than at home, and boys of the first or\r\nsecond class, marines, and ordinary seamen, are for the most part the\r\nvictims.... We were at anchor in Simon’s Bay. All the minutiæ of the scene\r\nI remember as though it were but yesterday. The morning was cool and\r\nclear, the hills clad in lilac and green, sea-birds floating high in air,\r\nand the waters of the bay reflecting the blue of the sky, and the lofty\r\nmountain-sides forming a picture almost dream-like in its quietude and\r\nserenity. The men were standing about in groups, dressed in their whitest\r\nof pantaloons, bluest of smocks, and neatest of black-silk neckerchiefs.\r\nBy-and-by the culprit was led in by a file of marines, and I went below\r\nwith him to make the preliminary examination, in order to report whether\r\nor not he might be fit for the punishment.\r\n\r\n“He was as good a specimen of the British mariner as one could wish to\r\nlook upon—hardy, bold, and wiry. His crime had been smuggling spirits on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n“‘Needn’t examine me, doctor,’ said he; ‘I aint afeared of their four\r\ndozen; they can’t hurt me, sir—leastways my back, you know—my breast,\r\nthough; hum—m!’ and he shook his head, rather sadly I thought, as he bent\r\ndown his eyes.\r\n\r\n“‘What,’ said I, ‘have you anything the matter with your chest?’\r\n\r\n“‘Nay, doctor, nay; it’s my feelings they’ll hurt. I’ve a little girl at\r\nhome that loves me, and, bless you, sir, I won’t look her in the face\r\nagain nohow.’\r\n\r\n“I felt his pulse. No lack of strength there, no nervousness; the artery\r\nhad the firm beat of health, the tendons felt like rods of iron beneath\r\nthe finger, and his biceps stood out hard and round as the mainstay of an\r\nold seventy-four.... All hands had already assembled—the men and boys on\r\none side, and the officers, in cocked hats and swords, on the other. A\r\ngrating had been lashed against the bulwark, and another placed on deck\r\nbeside it. The culprit’s shoulders and back were bared, and a strong belt\r\nfastened around the lower part of the loins for protection; he was then\r\nfirmly tied by the hands to the upper, and by the feet to the lower\r\ngrating; a little basin of cold water was placed at his feet, and all was\r\nnow prepared. The sentence was read, and orders given to proceed with the\r\npunishment. The cat is a terrible instrument of torture; I would not use\r\nit on a bull unless in self-defence; the shaft is about a foot and a half\r\nlong, and covered with green or red baize, according to taste; the thongs\r\nare nine, about twenty-eight inches in length, of the thickness of a\r\ngoose-quill, and with two knots tied on each. Men describe the first blow\r\nas like a shower of molten lead.\r\n\r\n“Combing out the thongs with his five fingers before each blow, firmly and\r\ndeterminedly was the first dozen delivered by the bo’swain’s mate, and as\r\nunflinchingly received.\r\n\r\n“Then, ‘One dozen, sir, please,’ he reported, saluting the commander.\r\n\r\n“‘Continue the punishment,’ was the calm reply.\r\n\r\n“A new man, and a new cat. Another dozen reported; again the same reply.\r\nThree dozen. The flesh, like burning steel, had changed from red to\r\npurple, and blue, and white; and between the third and fourth dozen, the\r\nsuffering wretch, pale enough now, and in all probability sick, begged a\r\ncomrade to give him a mouthful of water.\r\n\r\n“There was a tear in the eye of the hardy sailor who obeyed him,\r\nwhispering as he did so, ‘Keep up, Bill; it’ll soon be over now.’\r\n\r\n“‘Five, six,’ the corporal slowly counted; ‘seven, eight.’ It is the last\r\ndozen, and how acute must be the torture! ‘Nine, ten.’ The blood comes now\r\nfast enough, and—yes, gentle reader, I _will_ spare your feelings. The man\r\nwas cast loose at last, and put on the sick-list; he had borne his\r\npunishment without a groan, and without moving a muscle. A large pet\r\nmonkey sat crunching nuts in the rigging, and grinning all the time; I\r\nhave no doubt _he_ enjoyed the spectacle immensely, _for he was only an\r\nape_.”\r\n\r\nDr. Stables gives his opinion on the use of the cat in honest and\r\noutspoken terms. He considers “corporal punishment, as applied to men,\r\n_cowardly_, _cruel_, and debasing to _human nature_; and as applied to\r\nboys, _brutal_, and sometimes even _fiendish_.”\r\n\r\nThe writer has statistics before him which prove that 456 cases of\r\nflogging boys took place in 1875, and that only seven men were punished\r\nduring that year. There is every probability that the use of the naval cat\r\nwill ere long be abolished, and important as is good discipline on board\r\nship, there are many leading authorities who believe that it can be\r\nmaintained without it. The captain of a vessel is its king, reigning in a\r\nlittle world of his own, and separated for weeks or months from the\r\npossibility of reprimand. If he is a tyrannical man, he can make his ship\r\na floating hell for all on board. A system of fines for small offences has\r\nbeen proposed, and the idea has this advantage, that in case they prove on\r\ninvestigation to have been unjustly imposed, the money can be returned.\r\nThe disgrace of a flogging sticks to a boy or man, and, besides, as a\r\npunishment is infinitely too severe for most of the offences for which it\r\nis inflicted. It would be a cruel punishment were the judge infallible,\r\nbut with an erring human being for an irresponsible judge, the matter is\r\nfar worse. And that good seamen are deterred from entering the Royal Navy,\r\nknowing that the commission of a peccadillo or two may bring down the cat\r\non their unlucky shoulders, is a matter of fact.\r\n\r\nWe shall meet the sailor on the sea many a time and again during the\r\nprogress of this work, and see how hardly he earns his scanty reward in\r\nthe midst of the awful dangers peculiar to the elements he dares.\r\nShakespeare says that he is—\r\n\r\n  “A man whom both the waters and the wind,\r\n  In that vast tennis-court, hath made the ball\r\n  For them to play on”—\r\n\r\nthat the men of all others who have made England what she is, have not\r\naltogether a bed of roses even on a well-conducted vessel, whilst they may\r\nlose their lives at any moment by shipwreck and sudden death. George\r\nHerbert says—\r\n\r\n  “Praise the sea, but keep on land.”\r\n\r\nAnd while the present writer would be sorry to prevent any healthy,\r\ncapable, adventurous boy from entering a noble profession, he recommends\r\nhim to first study the literature of the sea to the best and fullest of\r\nhis ability. Our succeeding chapter will exhibit some of the special\r\nperils which surround the sailor’s life, whilst it will exemplify to some\r\nextent the qualities specially required and expected from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PERILS OF THE SAILOR’S LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Loss of the _Captain_—Six Hundred Souls swept into Eternity\r\n           without a Warning—The Mansion and the Cottage alike\r\n       Sufferers—Causes of the Disaster—Horrors of the Scene—Noble\r\n      Captain Burgoyne—Narratives of Survivors—An almost Incredible\r\n       Feat—Loss of the _Royal George_—A great Disaster caused by a\r\n     Trifle—Nine Hundred Lost—A Child saved by a Sheep—The Portholes\r\n      Upright—An involuntary Bath of Tar—Rafts of Corpses—The Vessel\r\n    Blown up in 1839-40—The Loss of the _Vanguard_—Half a Million sunk\r\n    in Fifty Minutes—Admirable Discipline on Board—All Saved—The Court\r\n                                 Martial.\r\n\r\n\r\nEngland, and indeed all Europe, long prior to 1870 had been busily\r\nconstructing ironclads, and the daily journals teemed with descriptions of\r\nnew forms and varieties of ships, armour, and armament, as well as of new\r\nand enormous guns, which, rightly directed, might sink them to the bottom.\r\nAmong the more curious of the ironclads of that period, and the\r\nconstruction of which had led to any quantity of discussion, sometimes of\r\na very angry kind, was the turret-ship—practically the sea-going\r\n“monitor”—_Captain_, which Captain Cowper Phipps Coles had at length been\r\npermitted to construct. Coles, who was an enthusiast of great scientific\r\nattainments, as well as a practical seaman, which too many of our\r\nexperimentalists in this direction have not been, had distinguished\r\nhimself in the Crimea, and had later made many improvements in rendering\r\nvessels shot-proof. His revolving turrets are, however, the inventions\r\nwith which his name are more intimately connected, although he had much to\r\ndo with the general construction of the _Captain_, and other ironclads of\r\nthe period.\r\n\r\nThe _Captain_ was a large double-screw armour-plated vessel, of 4,272\r\ntons. Her armour in the most exposed parts was eight inches in thickness,\r\nranging elsewhere downwards from seven to as low as three inches. She had\r\ntwo revolving turrets, the strongest and heaviest yet built, and carried\r\nsix powerful guns. Among the peculiarities of her construction were, that\r\nshe had only nine feet of “free-board”—_i.e._, that was the height of her\r\nsides out of water. The forecastle and after-part of the vessel were\r\nraised above this, and they were connected with a light hurricane-deck.\r\nThis, as we shall see, played an important part in the sad disaster we\r\nhave to relate.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 8th of September, 1870, English readers, at their\r\nbreakfast-tables, in railway carriages, and everywhere, were startled with\r\nthe news that the _Captain_ had foundered, with all hands, in the Bay of\r\nBiscay. Six hundred men had been swept into eternity without a moment’s\r\nwarning. She had been in company with the squadron the night before, and,\r\nindeed, had been visited by the admiral, for purposes of inspection, the\r\nprevious afternoon. The early part of the evening had been fine; later it\r\nhad become what sailors call “dirty weather;” at midnight the wind rose\r\nfast, and soon culminated in a furious gale. At 2.15 in the morning of the\r\n7th a heavy bank of clouds passed off, and the stars came out clear and\r\nbright, the moon then setting; but no vessel could be discerned where the\r\n_Captain_ had been last observed. At daybreak the squadron was all in\r\nsight, but scattered. “_Only ten ships instead of eleven could be\r\ndiscerned, the __‘__Captain__’__ being the missing one._” Later, it\r\nappeared that seventeen of the men and the gunner had escaped, and landed\r\nat Corbucion, north of Cape Finisterre, on the afternoon of the 7th. _All\r\nthe men who were saved belonged to the starboard watch_; or, in other\r\nwords, none escaped except those on deck duty. Every man below, whether\r\nsoundly sleeping after his day’s work, or tossing sleeplessly in his\r\nberth, thinking of home and friends and present peril, or watching the\r\nengines, or feeding the furnaces, went down, without the faintest\r\npossibility of escaping his doom.\r\n\r\nThink of this catastrophe, and what it involved! The families and friends\r\nof 600 men plunged into mourning, and the scores on scores of wives and\r\nchildren into poverty! In _one_ street of Portsea, thirty wives were made\r\nwidows by the occurrence.(43) The shock of the news killed one poor woman,\r\nthen in weak health. Nor were the sad effects confined to the cottages of\r\nthe poor. The noble-hearted captain of the vessel was a son of\r\nField-Marshal Burgoyne; Captain Coles, her inventor; a son of Mr.\r\nChilders, the then First Lord of the Admiralty; the younger son of Lord\r\nNorthbrook; the third son of Lord Herbert of Lea; and Lord Lewis Gordon,\r\nbrother of the Marquis of Huntley, were among the victims of that terrible\r\nmorning. The intelligence arrived during the excitement caused by the\r\ndefeat and capitulation of Sedan, which, involving, as it did, the\r\ndeposition of the Emperor and the fate of France, was naturally the great\r\ntopic of discussion, but for the time it overshadowed even those great\r\nevents, for it was a national calamity.\r\n\r\nFrom the statements of survivors we now know that the watch had been\r\ncalled a few minutes past midnight; and as the men were going on deck to\r\nmuster, the ship gave a terrible lurch to starboard, soon, however,\r\nrighting herself on that occasion. Robert Hirst, a seaman, who afterwards\r\ngave some valuable testimony, was on the forecastle. There was a very\r\nstrong wind, and the ship was then only carrying her three top-sails,\r\ndouble reefs in each, and the foretop-mast stay-sail. The yards were\r\nbraced sharp up, and the ship had little way upon her.(44) As the watch\r\nwas mustered, he heard Captain Burgoyne give the order, “Let go the\r\nforetop-sail halyards!” followed by, “Let go fore and maintop-sail\r\nsheets!” By the time the men got to the top-sail sheets the ship was\r\nheeling over to starboard so much that others were being washed off the\r\ndeck, the ship lying down on her side, as she was gradually turning over\r\nand trembling through her whole frame with every blow which the short,\r\njumping, vicious seas, now white with the squall, gave her.(45) The roar\r\nof the steam from her boilers was terrific, “outscreaming the noise of the\r\nstorm,” but not drowning the shrieks of the poor engineers and stokers\r\nwhich were heard by some of the survivors. The horrors of their situation\r\ncan be imagined. The sea, breaking down the funnel, would soon, no doubt,\r\nextinguish the furnaces, but not until some of their contents had been\r\ndashed into the engine-room, with oceans of scalding water; the boilers\r\nthemselves may, likely enough, have given way and burst also. Mercifully,\r\nit was not for long. Hirst, with two other men, rushed to the\r\nweather-forecastle netting and jumped overboard. It was hardly more than a\r\nfew moments before they found themselves washed on to the bilge of the\r\nship’s bottom, for in that brief space of time the ship had turned\r\ncompletely over, and almost immediately went down. Hirst and his\r\ncompanions went down with the ship, but the next feeling of consciousness\r\nby the former was coming into contact with a floating spar, to which he\r\ntied himself with his black silk handkerchief. He was soon, however,\r\nwashed from the spar, but got hold of the stern of the second launch,\r\nwhich was covered with canvas, and floating as it was stowed on board the\r\nship. Other men were there, on the top of the canvas covering. Immediately\r\nafter, they fell in with the steam-lifeboat pinnace, bottom-up, with\r\nCaptain Burgoyne and several men clinging to it. Four men, of whom Mr.\r\nMay,(46) the gunner, was one, jumped from off the bottom of the\r\nsteam-pinnace to the launch. One account says that Captain Burgoyne\r\nincited them, by calling out, “Jump, men, jump!” but did not do it\r\nhimself. The canvas was immediately cut away, and with the oars free, they\r\nattempted to pull up to the steam-pinnace to rescue the captain and others\r\nremaining there. This they found impossible to accomplish. As soon as they\r\nendeavoured to get the boat’s head up to the sea to row her to windward to\r\nwhere the capsized boat was floating, their boat was swamped almost level\r\nto her thwarts, and two of the men were washed clean out of her. The pump\r\nwas set going, and the boat bailed out with their caps, &c., as far as\r\npossible. They then made a second attempt to row the boat against the sea,\r\nwhich was as unsuccessful as before. Meantime, poor Burgoyne was still\r\nclinging to the pinnace, in “a storm of broken waters.” When the launch\r\nwas swept towards him once, one of the men on board offered to throw him\r\nan oar, which he declined, saying, nobly, “For God’s sake, men, keep your\r\noars: you will want them.” This piece of self-abnegation probably cost him\r\nhis life, for he went down shortly after, following “the six hundred” of\r\nhis devoted crew into “the valley of death.” The launch was beaten hither\r\nand thither; and a quarter of an hour after the _Captain_ had capsized,\r\nsighted the lights of one of their own ships, which was driven by in the\r\ngale, its officers knowing nothing of the fate of these unfortunates, or\r\ntheir still more hapless companions. Mr. May, the gunner, took charge of\r\nthe launch, and at daybreak they sighted Cape Finisterre, inside which\r\nthey landed after twelve hours’ hard work at the oars.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: THE “CAPTAIN” IN THE BAY OF BISCAY.]\r\n\r\nOne man, when he found the vessel capsizing, crawled over the\r\nweather-netting on the port side, and performed an almost incredible feat.\r\nIt is well told in his own laconic style:—“Felt ship heel over, and felt\r\nshe would not right. Made for weather-hammock netting. She was then on her\r\nbeam-ends. Got along her bottom by degrees, as she kept turning over,\r\nuntil I was where her keel would have been if she had one. The seas then\r\nwashed me off. I saw a piece of wood about twenty yards off, and swam to\r\nit.” In other words, he got over her side, and walked _up_ to the bottom!\r\nWhile in the water, two poor drowning wretches caught hold of him, and\r\nliterally tore off the legs of his trousers. He could not help them, and\r\nthey sank for the last time.\r\n\r\nMany and varied were the explanations given of the causes of this\r\ndisaster. There had evidently been some uneasiness in regard to her\r\nstability in the water at one time, but she had sailed so well on previous\r\ntrips, in the same stormy waters, that confidence had been restored in\r\nher. The belief, afterwards, among many authorities, was that she ought\r\nnot to have carried sail at all.(47) This was the primary cause of the\r\ndisaster, no doubt; and then, in all probability, when the force of the\r\nwind had heeled her over, a heavy sea struck her and completely capsized\r\nher—the water on and over her depressed side assisting by weighting her\r\ndownwards. The side of the hurricane-deck acted, when the vessel was\r\nheeled over, as one vast sail, and, no doubt, had much to do with putting\r\nher on her beam-ends. The general impression of the survivors appeared to\r\nbe that, with the ship heeling over, the pressure of a strong wind upon\r\nthe under part of the hurricane-deck had a greater effect or leverage upon\r\nthe hull, than the pressure of the wind on her top-sails. They were also\r\nnearly unanimous in their opinion that when the _Captain’s_ starboard side\r\nwas well down in the water, with the weight of water on the turret-deck,\r\nand the pressure of the wind blowing from the port hand on the under\r\nsurface of the hurricane-deck, and thus pushing the ship right over, she\r\nhad no chance of righting herself again.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked that long after the _Captain_ had sunk, the admiral\r\nof the squadron thought that he saw her, although it was very evident\r\nafterwards that it must have been some other vessel. In his despatch to\r\nthe Admiralty,(48) which very plainly indicated that he had some anxiety\r\nin regard to her stability in bad weather, he described her appearance and\r\nbehaviour up till 1.30 a.m.—more than an hour after her final exit to the\r\ndepths below. In the days of superstitious belief, so common among\r\nsailors, a thrilling story of her image haunting the spot would surely\r\nhave been built on this foundation.\r\n\r\nIn the old fighting-days of the Royal Navy, when success followed success,\r\nand prize after prize rewarded the daring and enterprise of its\r\ncommanders, they did not think very much of the loss of a vessel more or\r\nless, but took the lesser evils with the greater goods. The seamanship was\r\nwonderful, but it was very often utterly reckless. A captain trained in\r\nthe school of Nelson and Cochrane would stop at nothing. The country,\r\naccustomed to great naval battles, enriched by the spoils of the enemy—who\r\nfurnished some of the finest vessels in our fleet—was not much affected by\r\nthe loss of a ship, and the Admiralty was inclined to deal leniently with\r\na spirited commander who had met with an accident. But then an accident in\r\nthose days did not mean the loss of half a million pounds or so. The cost\r\nof a large ironclad of to-day would have built a small wooden fleet of\r\nthose days.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the _Captain_ irresistibly brings to memory another great loss\r\nto the Royal Navy, which occurred nearly ninety years before, and by which\r\n900 lives were in a moment swept into eternity. It proved too plainly that\r\n“wooden walls” might capsize as readily as the “crankiest” ironclad. The\r\nreader will immediately guess that we refer to the loss of the _Royal\r\nGeorge_, which took place at Spithead, on the 28th of August, 1782, in\r\ncalm weather, but still under circumstances which, to a very great extent,\r\nexplain how the _Captain_—at the best, a vessel of doubtful\r\nstability—capsized in the stormy waters of Biscay. The _Royal George_ was,\r\nat the time, the oldest first-rate in the service, having been put into\r\ncommission in 1755. She carried 108 guns, and was considered a staunch\r\nship, and a good sailer. Anson, Boscawen, Rodney, Howe, and Hawke had all\r\nrepeatedly commanded in her.\r\n\r\nFrom what small causes may great and lamentable disasters arise! “During\r\nthe washing of her decks, on the 28th, the carpenter discovered that the\r\npipe which admitted the water to cleanse and sweeten the ship, and which\r\nwas about three feet under the water, was out of repair—that it was\r\nnecessary to replace it with a new one, and to heel her on one side for\r\nthat purpose.” The guns on the port side of the ship were run out of the\r\nport-holes as far as they would go, and those from the starboard side were\r\ndrawn in and secured amidships. This brought her porthole-sills on the\r\nlower side nearly even with the water. “At about 9 o’clock a.m., or rather\r\nbefore,” stated one of the survivors,(49) “we had just finished our\r\nbreakfast, and the last lighter, with rum on board, had come alongside;\r\nthis vessel was a sloop of about fifty tons, and belonged to three\r\nbrothers, who used her to carry things on board the men-of-war. She was\r\nlashed to the larboard side of the _Royal George_, and we were piped to\r\nclear the lighter and get the rum out of her, and stow it in the hold....\r\nAt first, no danger was apprehended from the ship being on one side,\r\nalthough the water kept dashing in at the portholes at every wave; and\r\nthere being mice in the lower part of the ship, which were disturbed by\r\nthe water which dashed in, they were hunted in the water by the men, and\r\nthere had been a rare game going on.” Their play was soon to be rudely\r\nstopped. The carpenter, perceiving that the ship was in great danger, went\r\ntwice on the deck to ask the lieutenant of the watch to order the ship to\r\nbe righted; the first time the latter barely answered him, and the second\r\nreplied, savagely, “If you can manage the ship better than I can, you had\r\nbetter take the command.” In a very short time, he began himself to see\r\nthe danger, and ordered the drummer to beat to right ship. It was too\r\nlate—the ship was beginning to sink; a sudden breeze springing upheeled\r\nher still more; the guns, shot, and heavy articles generally, and a large\r\npart of the men on board, fell irresistibly to the lower side; and the\r\nwater, forcing itself in at every port, weighed the vessel down still\r\nmore. She fell on her broadside, with her masts nearly flat on the water,\r\nand sank to the bottom immediately. “The officers, in their confusion,\r\nmade no signal of distress, nor, indeed, could any assistance have availed\r\nif they had, after her lower-deck ports were in the water, which forced\r\nitself in at every port with fearful velocity.” In going down, the\r\nmain-yard of the _Royal George_ caught the boom of the rum-lighter and\r\nsank her, drowning some of those on board.\r\n\r\nAt this terrible moment there were nearly 1,200 persons(50) on board.\r\nDeducting the larger proportion of the watch on deck, about 230, who were\r\nmostly saved by running up the rigging, and afterwards taken off by the\r\nboats sent for their rescue, and, perhaps, seventy others who managed to\r\nscramble out of the ports, &c., the whole of the remainder perished.\r\nAdmiral Kempenfelt, whose flag-ship it was, and who was then writing in\r\nhis cabin, and had just before been shaved by the barber, went down with\r\nher. The first-captain tried to acquaint him that the ship was sinking,\r\nbut the heeling over of the ship had so jammed the doors of the cabin that\r\nthey could not be opened. One young man was saved, as the vessel filled,\r\nby the force of the water rushing upwards, and sweeping him bodily before\r\nit through a hatchway. In a few seconds, he found himself floating on the\r\nsurface of the sea, where he was, later, picked up by a boat. A little\r\nchild was almost miraculously preserved by a sheep, which swam some time,\r\nand with which he had doubtless been playing on deck. He held by the\r\nfleece till rescued by a gentleman in a wherry. His father and mother were\r\nboth drowned, and the poor little fellow did not even know their names;\r\nall that he knew was that his own name was Jack. His preserver provided\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: THE WRECK OF THE “ROYAL GEORGE.”]\r\n\r\nOne of the survivors,(51) who got through a porthole, looked back and saw\r\nthe opening “as full of heads as it could cram, all trying to get out. I\r\ncaught,” said he, “hold of the best bower-anchor, which was just above me,\r\nto prevent falling back again into the porthole, and seizing hold of a\r\nwoman who was trying to get out of the same porthole, I dragged her out.”\r\nThe same writer says that he saw “all the heads drop back again in at the\r\nporthole, for the ship had got so much on her larboard side _that the\r\nstarboard portholes were as upright as if the men had tried to get out of\r\nthe top of a __chimney, with nothing for their legs and feet to act\r\nupon_.” The sinking of the vessel drew him down to the bottom, but he was\r\nenabled afterwards to rise to the surface and swim to one of the great\r\nblocks of the ship which had floated off. At the time the ship was\r\nsinking, an open barrel of tar stood on deck. When he rose, it was\r\nfloating on the water like fat, and he got into the middle of it, coming\r\nout as black as a negro minstrel!\r\n\r\nWhen this man had got on the block he observed the admiral’s baker in the\r\nshrouds of the mizentop-mast, which were above water not far off; and\r\ndirectly after, the poor woman whom he had pulled out of the porthole came\r\nrolling by. He called out to the baker to reach out his arm and catch her,\r\nwhich was done. She hung, quite insensible, for some time by her chin over\r\none of the ratlines of the shrouds, but a surf soon washed her off again.\r\nShe was again rescued shortly after, and life was not extinct; she\r\nrecovered her senses when taken on board our old friend the _Victory_,\r\nthen lying with other large ships near the _Royal George_. The captain of\r\nthe latter was saved, but the poor carpenter, who did his best to save the\r\nship, was drowned.\r\n\r\nIn a few days after the _Royal George_ sank, bodies would come up, thirty\r\nor forty at a time. A corpse would rise “so suddenly as to frighten any\r\none.” The watermen, there is no doubt, made a good thing of it; they took\r\nfrom the bodies of the men their buckles, money, and watches, and then\r\nmade fast a rope to their heels and towed them to land.” The writer of the\r\nnarrative from which this account is mainly derived says that he “saw them\r\ntowed into Portsmouth Harbour, in their mutilated condition, in the same\r\nmanner as rafts of floating timber, and promiscuously (for particularity\r\nwas scarcely possible) put into carts, which conveyed them to their final\r\nsleeping-place, in an excavation prepared for them in Kingstown\r\nchurchyard, the burial-place belonging to the parish of Portsea.” Many\r\nbodies were washed ashore on the Isle of Wight.\r\n\r\nFutile attempts were made the following year to raise the wreck, but it\r\nwas not till 1839-40 that Colonel Pasley proposed, and successfully\r\ncarried out, the operations for its removal. Wrought-iron cylinders, some\r\nof the larger of which contained over a ton each of gunpowder, were\r\nlowered and fired by electricity, and the vessel was, by degrees, blown\r\nup. Many of the guns, the capstans, and other valuable parts of the wreck\r\nwere recovered by the divers, and the timbers formed then, and since, a\r\nperfect godsend to some of the inhabitants of Portsmouth, who manufactured\r\nthem into various forms of “relics” of the _Royal George_. It is said that\r\nthe sale of these has been so enormous that if they could be collected and\r\nstuck together they would form several vessels of the size of the fine old\r\nfirst-rate, large as she was! But something similar has been said of the\r\n“wood of the true cross,” and, no doubt, is more than equally libellous.\r\n\r\nIt is said, by those who descended to the wreck, that its appearance was\r\nmost beautiful, when seen from about a fathom above the deck. It was\r\ncovered with seaweeds, shells, starfish, and anemones, while from and\r\naround its ports and openings the fish, large and small, swam and\r\nplayed—darting, flashing, and sparkling in the clear green water.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: H.M.S. _VANGUARD_ AT SEA.]\r\n\r\nThere is probably no reasonable being in or out of the navy who does not\r\nbelieve that the ironclad is the war-vessel of the immediate future. But\r\nthat a woeful amount of uncertainty, as thick as the fog in which the\r\n_Vanguard_ went down, envelops the subject in many ways, is most certain.\r\nThe circumstances connected with that great disaster are still in the\r\nmemory of the public, and were simple and distinct enough. During the last\r\nweek of August, 1875, the reserve squadron of the Channel Fleet,\r\ncomprising the _Warrior_, _Achilles_, _Hector_, _Iron Duke_, and\r\n_Vanguard_, with Vice-Admiral Sir W. Tarleton’s yacht _Hawk_, had been\r\nstationed at Kingstown. At half-past ten on the morning of the 1st of\r\nSeptember they got into line for the purpose of proceeding to Queenstown,\r\nCork. Off the Irish lightship, which floats at sea, six miles off\r\nKingstown, the _Achilles_ hoisted her ensign to say farewell—her\r\ndestination being Liverpool. The sea was moderate, but a fog came on and\r\nincreased in density every moment. Half an hour after noon, the “look-out”\r\ncould not distinguish fifty yards ahead, and the officers on the bridge\r\ncould not see the bowsprit. The ships had been proceeding at the rate of\r\ntwelve or fourteen knots, but their speed had been reduced when the fog\r\ncame on, and they were running at not more than half the former speed. The\r\n_Vanguard_ watch reported a sail ahead, and the helm was put hard aport to\r\nprevent running it down. The _Iron Duke_ was then following close in the\r\nwake of the _Vanguard_, and the action of the latter simply brought them\r\ncloser, and presented a broadside to the former, which, unaware of any\r\nchange, had continued her course. The commander of the _Iron Duke_,\r\nCaptain Hickley, who was on the bridge at the time, saw the spectre form\r\nof the _Vanguard_ through the fog, and ordered his engines to be reversed,\r\nbut it was too late. The ram of the _Iron Duke_ struck the _Vanguard_\r\nbelow the armour-plates, on the port side, abreast of the engine-room. The\r\nrent made was very large—amounting, as the divers afterwards found, to\r\nfour feet in width—and the water poured into the hold in torrents. It\r\nmight be only a matter of minutes before she should go down.(52)\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: THE LOSS OF THE “VANGUARD.”]\r\n\r\nThe vessel was doomed; a very brief examination proved that: nothing\r\nremained but to save the lives of those on board. Captain Dawkins gave the\r\nnecessary orders with a coolness which did not represent, doubtless, the\r\nconflicting feelings within his breast. The officers ably seconded him,\r\nand the crew behaved magnificently. One of the mechanics went below in the\r\nengine-room to let off the steam, and so prevent an explosion, at the\r\nimminent risk of his life. The water rose quickly in the after-part, and\r\nrushed into the engine and boiler rooms, eventually finding its way into\r\nthe provision-room flat, through imperfectly fastened (so-called)\r\n“water-tight” doors, and gradually over the whole ship. There was no time\r\nto be lost. Captain Dawkins called out to his men that if they preserved\r\norder all would be saved. The men stood as at an inspection—not one moved\r\nuntil ordered to do so. The boats of both ships were lowered. While the\r\nlaunching was going on, the swell of the tide caused a lifeboat to surge\r\nagainst the hull, and one of the crew had his finger crushed. This was\r\nabsolutely the only casualty. In twenty minutes the whole of the men were\r\ntransferred to the _Iron Duke_, no single breach of discipline occurring\r\nbeyond the understandable request of a sailor once in awhile to be allowed\r\nto make one effort to secure some keepsake or article of special value to\r\nhimself. But the order was stern: “Boys, come instantly.” As “four bells”\r\n(2 p.m.) was striking, the last man having been received on the _Iron\r\nDuke_, the doomed vessel whirled round two or three times, and then sank\r\nin deep water.(53)\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, then, that the discipline and courage of the service had\r\nnot deteriorated from that always expected in the good old days. Captain\r\nDawkins was the last man to leave his sinking ship, and his officers one\r\nand all behaved in the same spirit. They endeavoured to quiet and reassure\r\nthe men—pointing out to them the fatal consequences of confusion. Captain\r\nDawkins may or may not have been rightly censured for his seamanship;\r\nthere can be no doubt that he performed his duty nobly in these systematic\r\nefforts to save his crew. However much was lost to the nation, no mother\r\nhad to mourn the loss of her sailor-boy; no wife had been made a widow, no\r\nchild an orphan; five hundred men had been saved to their country.\r\n\r\nOne of the officers of the _Vanguard_, in a letter to a friend,\r\ngraphically described the scene at and after the collision. After having\r\nlunched, he entered the ward-room, where he encountered the surgeon, Dr.\r\nFisher, who was reading a newspaper. “After remarking on the thickness of\r\nthe fog, Fisher went to look out of one of the ports, and immediately\r\ncried out, ‘God help us! here is a ship right into us!’ We rushed on deck,\r\nand at that moment the _Iron Duke_ struck us with fearful force, spars and\r\nblocks falling about, and causing great danger to us on deck. The _Iron\r\nDuke_ then dropped astern, and was lost sight of in the fog. The water\r\ncame into the engine-room in tons, stopping the engines, putting the fires\r\nout, and nearly drowning the engineers and stokers.... The ship was now\r\nreported sinking fast, although all the water-tight compartments had been\r\nclosed. But in consequence of the shock, some of the water-tight doors\r\nleaked fearfully, letting water into the other parts of the ship.\r\nMinute-guns were being fired, and the boats were got out.... At this\r\nmoment the _Iron Duke_ appeared, lowering her boats and sending them as\r\nfast as possible. The sight of her cheered us up, as we had been\r\nfrightened that she would not find us in the fog, in spite of the guns.\r\nThe scene on deck can only be realised by those who have witnessed a\r\nsimilar calamity. The booming of the minute-guns, the noise of the immense\r\nvolume of steam rushing out of the escape-funnel, and the orders of the\r\ncaptain, were strangely mingled, while a voice from a boat reported how\r\nfast she was sinking.”\r\n\r\nWhen the vessel went down, the deck of the _Iron Duke_ was crowded with\r\nmen watching the _finale_ of the catastrophe. When she was about to sink,\r\nshe heeled gradually over until the whole of her enormous size to the keel\r\nwas above water. Then she gradually sank, righting herself as she went\r\ndown, stern first, the water being blown from hawse-holes in huge spouts\r\nby the force of the air rushing out of the ship. She then disappeared from\r\nview. The men were much saddened to see their home go down, carrying\r\neverything they possessed. They had been paid that morning, and a large\r\nnumber of them lost their little accumulated earnings. These were, of\r\ncourse, afterwards allowed them by the Admiralty.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: THE “VANGUARD” AS SHE APPEARED AT LOW WATER.]\r\n\r\nThe _Vanguard_ and the _Iron Duke_ were two of a class of broadside\r\nironclads, built with a view to general and not special utility in\r\nwarfare. Their thickest armour was eight inches, a mere strip, 100 feet\r\nlong by three high, and much of the visible part of them was unarmoured\r\naltogether, while below it varied from six inches to as low as\r\nthree-eighths of an inch. It was only the latter thickness where the point\r\nof the _Iron Duke’s_ ram entered. Their advocates boasted that they could\r\npass through the Suez Canal, and go anywhere.\r\n\r\nEvery reader will remember the stormy discussion which ensued, in which\r\nnot merely the ironclad question, but the court-martial which followed—and\r\nthe Admiralty decision which followed that—were severely handled. Nor\r\ncould there be much wonder at all this, for a vessel which had cost the\r\nnation over a quarter of a million of pounds sterling, with equipment and\r\nproperty on board which had cost as much more,(54) was lost for ever. It\r\nwas in vain that the then First Lord of the Admiralty(55) told us, in\r\nsomewhat flippant tones, that we ought to be rather satisfied than\r\notherwise with the occurrence. It was not altogether satisfactory to learn\r\nfrom Mr. Reed, the principal designer of both ships, that ironclads were\r\nin more danger in times of peace than in times of war.(56) In the former\r\nthey were residences for several hundred sailors, and many of the\r\nwater-tight doors could not be kept closed without inconvenience; in the\r\nlatter they were fortresses, when the doors would be closed for safety.\r\nThe court-martial, constituted of leading naval authorities and officers,\r\nimputed blame for the high rate of speed sustained in a fog; the public\r\nnaturally inquired why a high rate of speed was necessary at all at the\r\ntime, but their lordships declined to consider this as in any way\r\ncontributing to the disaster. The Court expressed its opinion pretty\r\nstrongly upon the conduct of the officers of the _Iron Duke_, which did\r\nthe mischief, and also indirectly blamed the admiral in command of the\r\nsquadron, but the Admiralty could find nothing wrong in either case,\r\nsimply visiting their wrath on the unfortunate lieutenant on deck at the\r\ntime. So, to make a long and very unpleasant story short, the loss of the\r\n_Vanguard_ brought about a considerable loss of faith in some of our\r\nlegally constituted naval authorities.(57)\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: THE LOSS OF THE “KENT.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n                PERILS OF THE SAILOR’S LIFE (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Value of Discipline—The Loss of the _Kent_—Fire on Board—The\r\n     Ship Waterlogged—Death in Two Forms—A Sail in Sight—Transference\r\n     of Six Hundred Passengers to a small Brig—Splendid Discipline of\r\n      the Soldiers—Imperturbable Coolness of the Captain—Loss of the\r\n        _Birkenhead_—Literally Broken in Two—Noble Conduct of the\r\n        Military—A contrary Example—Wreck of the _Medusa_—Run on a\r\n      Sand-bank—Panic on Board—Raft constructed—Insubordination and\r\n    Selfishness—One Hundred and Fifty Souls Abandoned—Drunkenness and\r\n    Mutiny on the Raft—Riots and Murders—Reduced to Thirty Persons—The\r\n        stronger part Massacre the others—Fifteen Left—Rescued at\r\n    Last—Another Contrast—Wreck of the _Alceste_—Admirable Conduct of\r\n          the Crew—The Ironclad Movement—The Battle of the Guns.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to read the account of any great disaster at sea, without\r\nbeing strongly impressed with the enormous value of maintaining in the\r\nhour of peril the same strict discipline which, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, is the rule of a vessel. Few more striking examples of this\r\nare to be found, than in the story of the loss of the _Kent_, which we are\r\nnow about to relate. The disaster of the _Medusa_, which we shall record\r\nlater, in which complete anarchy and disregard of discipline, aggravated a\r\nhundredfold the horrors of the situation, only teaches the same lesson\r\nfrom the opposite point of view. Though the most independent people on the\r\nearth, all Englishmen worthy of the name appreciate the value of proper\r\nsubordination and obedience to those who have rightful authority to\r\ncommand. This was almost the only gratifying feature connected with the\r\nloss of the _Vanguard_, and the safe and rapid transference of the crew to\r\nthe _Iron Duke_ was due to it. But the circumstances of the case were as\r\nnought to some that have preceded it, where the difficulties and risks\r\nwere infinitely greater and the reward much less certain. The _Kent_ was a\r\nfine troop-ship, of 1,530 tons, bound from England for Bengal and China.\r\nShe had on board 344 soldiers, forty-three women, and sixty-six children.\r\nThe officers, private passengers, and crew brought the total number on\r\nboard to 640. After leaving the Downs, on the 19th of February, 1825, she\r\nencountered terrible weather, culminating in a gale on the 1st of March,\r\nwhich obliged them almost to sail under bare poles. The narrative(58) by\r\nSir Duncan MacGregor, one of the passengers, created an immense sensation\r\nat its first appearance, and was translated into almost every language of\r\nthe civilised world. He states that the rolling of the ship, which was\r\nvastly increased by a dead weight of some hundred tons of shot and shells\r\nthat formed a part of its lading, became so great about half-past eleven\r\nor twelve o’clock at night, that the main-chains were thrown by every\r\nlurch considerably under water; and the best cleated articles of furniture\r\nin the cabin and the cuddy were dashed about in all directions.\r\n\r\nIt was a little before this period that one of the officers of the ship,\r\nwith the well-meant intention of ascertaining that all was fast below,\r\ndescended with a lantern. He discovered one of the spirit-casks adrift,\r\nand sent two or three sailors for some billets of wood to secure it. While\r\nthey were absent, he unfortunately dropped the lamp, and letting go his\r\nhold of the cask in his eagerness to recover it, the former suddenly\r\nstove, and the spirits communicating with the light, the whole deck at\r\nthat part was speedily in a blaze. The fire spread rapidly, and all their\r\nefforts at extinguishing it were vain, although bucket after bucket of\r\nwater, wet sails and hammocks, were immediately applied. The smoke began\r\nto ascend the hatchway, and although every effort was made to keep the\r\npassengers in ignorance, the terrible news soon spread that the ship was\r\non fire. As long as the devouring element appeared to be confined to the\r\nspot where the fire originated, and which they were assured was surrounded\r\non all sides with water-casks, there was some hope that it might be\r\nsubdued; but soon the light-blue vapour that at first arose was succeeded\r\nby volumes of thick, dingy smoke, which ascended through all the hatchways\r\nand rolled over the ship. A thorough panic took possession of most on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nThe deck was covered with six hundred men, women, and children, many\r\nalmost frantic with excitement—wives seeking their husbands, children\r\ntheir mothers; strong men appearing as though their reason was overthrown,\r\nweak men maudlin and weeping; many good people on their knees in earnest\r\nprayer. Some of the older and more stout-hearted soldiers and sailors\r\nsullenly took their seats directly over the powder-magazine, expecting\r\nmomentarily that it would explode and put them out of their misery. A\r\nstrong pitchy smell suddenly wafted over the ship. “The flames have\r\nreached the cable-tier!” exclaimed one; and it was found to be too true.\r\nThe fire had now extended so far, that there was but one course to pursue:\r\nthe lower decks must be swamped. Captain Cobb, the commander of the\r\n_Kent_, was a man of action, and, with an ability and decision that seemed\r\nonly to increase with the imminence of the danger, ordered the lower decks\r\nto be scuttled, the coverings of the hatches removed, and the lower ports\r\nopened to the free admission of the waves. His instructions were speedily\r\nobeyed, the soldiers aiding the crew. The fury of the flames was, of\r\ncourse, checked; but several sick soldiers and children, and one woman,\r\nunable to gain the upper deck, were drowned, and others suffocated. As the\r\nrisk of explosion somewhat diminished, a new horror arose. The ship became\r\nwater-logged, and presented indications of settling down. Death in two\r\nforms stared them in the face.\r\n\r\nNo sail had been seen for many days, the vessel being somewhat out of the\r\nregular course. But, although it seemed hopeless, a man was sent up to the\r\nforetop to scan the horizon. How many anxious eyes were turned up to him,\r\nhow many anxious hearts beat at that moment, can well be understood. The\r\nsailor threw his eyes rapidly over the waste of howling waters, and\r\ninstantly waved his hat, exclaiming, in a voice hoarse with emotion, “A\r\nsail on the lee bow!” Flags of distress were soon hoisted, minute-guns\r\nfired, and an attempt made to bear down on the welcome stranger, which for\r\nsome time did not notice them. But at last it seemed probable, by her\r\nslackening sail and altering her course, that the _Kent_ had been seen.\r\nHope revived on board; but there were still three painful problems to be\r\nsolved. The vessel in the distance was but a small brig: could she take\r\nover six hundred persons on board? Could they be transferred during a\r\nterrible gale and heavy sea, likely enough to swamp all the boats? Might\r\nnot the _Kent_ either blow up or speedily founder, before even one soul\r\nwere saved?\r\n\r\nThe vessel proved to be the _Cambria_, a brig bound to Vera Cruz, with a\r\nnumber of miners on board. For fifteen minutes it had been very doubtful\r\nto all on the _Kent_ whether their signals of distress—and the smoke\r\nissuing from the hatchways formed no small item among them—were seen, or\r\nthe minute-guns heard. But at length it became obvious that the brig was\r\nmaking for them, and preparations were made to clear and lower the boats\r\nof the East Indiaman. “Although,” says Sir Duncan MacGregor, “it was\r\nimpossible, and would have been improper, to repress the rising hopes that\r\nwere pretty generally diffused amongst us by the unexpected sight of the\r\n_Cambria_, yet I confess, that when I reflected on the long period our\r\nship had been already burning—on the tremendous sea that was running—on\r\nthe extreme smallness of the brig, and the immense number of human beings\r\nto be saved—I could only venture to hope that a few might be spared.” When\r\nthe military officers were consulting together, as the brig was\r\napproaching, on the requisite preparations for getting out the boats, and\r\nother necessary courses of action, one of the officers asked Major\r\nMacGregor in what order it was intended the officers should move off, to\r\nwhich he replied, “Of course, in funeral order,” which injunction was\r\ninstantly confirmed by Colonel Fearon, who said, “Most undoubtedly—the\r\njuniors first; but see that any man is cut down who presumes to enter the\r\nboats before the means of escape are presented to the women and children.”\r\nTo prevent any rush of troops or sailors to the boats, the officers were\r\nstationed near them with drawn swords. But, to do the soldiers and seamen\r\njustice, it was little needed; the former particularly keeping perfect\r\norder, and assisting to save the ladies and children and private\r\npassengers generally. Some of the women and children were placed in the\r\nfirst boat, which was immediately lowered into a sea so tempestuous that\r\nthere was great danger that it would be swamped, while the lowering-tackle\r\nnot being properly disengaged at the stern, there was a great prospect for\r\na few moments that its living freight would be upset in the water. A\r\nsailor, however, succeeded in cutting the ropes with an axe, and the first\r\nboat got off safely.\r\n\r\nThe _Cambria_ had been intentionally lain at some distance from the\r\n_Kent_, lest she should be involved in her explosion, or exposed to the\r\nfire from the guns, which, being all shotted, went off as the flames\r\nreached them. The men had a considerable distance to row, and the success\r\nof the first experiment was naturally looked upon as the measure of their\r\nfuture hopes. The movements of this boat were watched with intense anxiety\r\nby all on board. “The better to balance the boat in the raging sea through\r\nwhich it had to pass, and to enable the seamen to ply their oars, the\r\nwomen and children were stowed promiscuously under the seats, and\r\nconsequently exposed to the risk of being drowned by the continual dashing\r\nof the spray over their heads, which so filled the boat during the passage\r\nthat before their arrival at the brig the poor females were sitting up to\r\ntheir waists in water, and their children kept with the greatest\r\ndifficulty above it.” Happily, at the expiration of twenty minutes, the\r\ncutter was seen alongside their ark of refuge. The next difficulty was to\r\nget the ladies and children on board the _Cambria_, for the sea was\r\nrunning high, and there was danger of the boat being swamped or stove\r\nagainst the side of the brig. The children were almost thrown on board,\r\nwhile the women had to spring towards the many friendly arms extended from\r\nthe vessel, when the waves lifted the boat momentarily in the right\r\nposition. However, all were safely transferred to the brig without serious\r\nmishap.\r\n\r\nIt became impossible for the boats, after the first trip, to come\r\nalongside the _Kent_, and a plan was adopted for lowering the women and\r\nchildren from the stern by tying them two and two together. The heaving of\r\nthe vessel, and the heavy sea raising the boat one instant and dropping it\r\nthe next, rendered this somewhat perilous. Many of the poor women were\r\nplunged several times in the water before they succeeded in landing safely\r\nin the boat, and many young children died from the effects—“the same\r\nviolent means which only reduced the parents to a state of exhaustion or\r\ninsensibility,” having entirely quenched the vital spark in their feeble\r\nframes. One fine fellow, a soldier, who had neither wife nor child of his\r\nown, but who showed great solicitude for the safety of others, insisted on\r\nhaving three children lashed to him, with whom he plunged into the water\r\nto reach the boat more quickly. He swam well, but could not get near the\r\nboat; and when he was eventually drawn on board again, two of the children\r\nwere dead. One man fell down the hatchway into the flames; another had his\r\nback broken, and was observed, quite doubled, falling overboard; a third\r\nfell between the boat and brig, and his head was literally crushed to\r\npieces; others were lost in their attempts to ascend the sides of the\r\n_Cambria_; and others, again, were drowned in their hurry to get on board\r\nthe boats.\r\n\r\nOne of the sailors, who had, with many others, taken his post over the\r\nmagazine, at last cried out, almost in ill-humour, “Well! if she won’t\r\nblow up, I’ll see if I can’t get away from her.” He was saved—and must\r\nhave felt quite disappointed. One of the three boats, swamped or stove\r\nduring the day, had on board a number of men who had been robbing the\r\ncabins during the confusion on board. “It is suspected that one or two of\r\nthose who went down, must have sunk beneath the weight of their spoils.”\r\n\r\nAs there was so much doubt as to how soon the vessel would explode or go\r\ndown, while the process of transference between the vessels occupied\r\nthree-quarters of an hour each trip, and other delays were caused by timid\r\npassengers and ladies who were naturally loath to be separated from their\r\nhusbands, they determined on a quicker mode of placing them in the boat. A\r\nrope was suspended from the end of the spanker-boom, along the slippery\r\ntop of which the passengers had either to walk, crawl, or be carried. The\r\nreader need not be told that this great boom or spar stretches out from\r\nthe mizen-mast far over the stern in a vessel the size of the _Kent_. On\r\nordinary occasions, in quiet weather, it would be fifteen or twenty feet\r\nabove the water, but with the vessel pitching and tossing during the\r\ncontinuous storm, it was raised often as much as forty feet in the air. It\r\nwill be seen that, under these circumstances, with the boat at the stern\r\nnow swept to some distance in the hollow of a wave, and now raised high on\r\nits crest, the lowering of oneself by the rope, to drop at the right\r\nmoment, was a perilous operation. It was a common thing for strong men to\r\nreach the boat in a state of utter exhaustion, having been several times\r\nimmersed in the waves and half drowned. But there were many strong and\r\nwilling hands among the soldiers and sailors ready to help the weak and\r\nfearful ones, and the transference went on with fair rapidity, though with\r\nevery now and again some sad casualty to record. The coolness and\r\ndetermination of the officers, military and marine, the good order and\r\nsubordination of most of the troops, and the bravery of many in risking\r\ntheir lives for others, seems at this time to have restored some little\r\nconfidence among the timid and shrinking on board. A little later, and the\r\ndeclining rays and fiery glow on the waves indicated that the sun was\r\nsetting. One can well understand the feeling of many on board as they\r\nwitnessed its disappearance and the approach of darkness. Were their lives\r\nalso to set in outer gloom—the ocean to be that night their grave?\r\n\r\nLate at night Major MacGregor went down to his cabin in search of a\r\nblanket to shelter him from the increasing cold. “The scene of desolation\r\nthat there presented itself was melancholy in the extreme. The place\r\nwhich, only a few short hours before, had been the scene of kindly\r\nintercourse and of social gaiety, was now entirely deserted, save by a few\r\nmiserable wretches who were either stretched in irrecoverable intoxication\r\non the floor, or prowling about, like beasts of prey, in search of\r\nplunder. The sofas, drawers, and other articles of furniture, the due\r\narrangement of which had cost so much thought and pains, were now broken\r\ninto a thousand pieces, and scattered in confusion around.... Some of the\r\ngeese and other poultry, escaped from their confinement, were cackling in\r\nthe cuddy; while a solitary pig, wandering from its sty in the forecastle,\r\nwas ranging at large in undisturbed possession of the Brussels carpet.”\r\n\r\nIt is highly to the credit of the officers, more especially to those who\r\nhad deck-cabins, from which it would be easy to remove many portable\r\narticles, and even trunks and boxes, that they entirely devoted their time\r\nand energies to saving life. They left the ship simply with the clothes\r\nthey stood in, and were the last to leave it, except, of course, where\r\nsubordinate officers were detailed to look after portions of the troops.\r\nCaptain Cobb, in his resolution to be the last to leave the ship, tried\r\nall he could to urge the few remaining persons on board to drop on the\r\nropes and save themselves. But finding all his entreaties fruitless, and\r\nhearing the guns successively explode in the hold, into which they had\r\nfallen, he at length, after doing all in his power to save them, got\r\nhimself into the boat by “laying hold of the topping-lift, or rope that\r\nconnects the driver-boom with the mizen-top, thereby getting over the\r\nheads of the infatuated men who occupied the boom, unable to go either\r\nbackward or forward, and ultimately dropping himself into the water.” One\r\nof the boats persevered in keeping its station under the _Kent’s_ stern,\r\nuntil the flames were bursting out of the cabin windows. The larger part\r\nof the poor wretches left on board were saved: when the vessel exploded,\r\nthey sought shelter in the chains, where they stood till the masts fell\r\noverboard, to which they then clung for some hours. Ultimately, they were\r\nrescued by Captain Bibbey, of the _Caroline_, a vessel bound from Egypt to\r\nLiverpool, who happened to see the explosion at a great distance, and\r\ninstantly made all sail in the direction whence it proceeded, afterwards\r\ncruising about for some time to pick up any survivors.\r\n\r\nAfter the arrival of the last boat at the _Cambria_, “the flames, which\r\nhad spread along the upper deck and poop, ascended with the rapidity of\r\nlightning to the masts and rigging, forming one general conflagration,\r\nthat illumined the heavens to an immense distance, and was strongly\r\nreflected on several objects on board the brig. The flags of distress,\r\nhoisted in the morning, were seen for a considerable time waving amid the\r\nflames, until the masts to which they were suspended successively fell,\r\nlike stately steeples, over the ship’s side.” At last, about half-past one\r\no’clock in the morning, the devouring element having communicated to the\r\nmagazine, the explosion was seen, and the blazing fragments of the once\r\nmagnificent _Kent_ were instantly hurled, like so many rockets, high into\r\nthe air; leaving, in the comparative darkness that succeeded, “the\r\ndeathful scene of that disastrous day floating before the mind like some\r\nfeverish dream.”\r\n\r\nThe scene on board the brig beggared description. The captain, who bore\r\nthe honoured name of Cook, and his crew of eight, did all that was in\r\ntheir power to alleviate the miseries of the six hundred persons added to\r\ntheir number; while they carried sail, even to the extent of danger, in\r\norder to make nine or ten knots to the nearest port. The Cornish miners\r\nand Yorkshire smelters on board gave up their beds and clothes and stores\r\nto the passengers; and it was extremely fortunate that the brig was on her\r\noutward voyage, for, had she been returning, she would not, in all\r\nprobability, have had provisions enough to feed six hundred persons for a\r\nsingle day. But at the best their condition was miserable. In the cabin,\r\nintended for eight or ten, eighty were packed, many nearly in a nude\r\ncondition, and many of the poor women not having space to lie down.\r\n\r\nThe gale increased; but still they crowded all sail—even at the risk of\r\ncarrying away the masts—and at length the welcome cry of “Land ahead!” was\r\nreported from mouth to mouth. They were off the Scilly lights, and\r\nspeedily afterwards reached Falmouth, where the inhabitants vied with each\r\nother in providing clothing and food and money for all who needed them.\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: FALMOUTH HARBOUR.]\r\n\r\nThe total loss from the _Kent_ was eighty-one souls; namely, fifty-four\r\nsoldiers, one woman, twenty children, one seaman, and five boys of the\r\ncrew. How much greater might it not have been but for the imperturbable\r\ncoolness, the commanding abilities, and the persevering and prompt action\r\nof Captain Cobb, and the admirable discipline and subordination of the\r\ntroops!\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: THE LOSS OF THE “BIRKENHEAD.”]\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable instance of the same thing is to be found in the case\r\nof the _Birkenhead_, where there were desperate odds against any one\r\nsurviving. The ship was a war-steamer, conveying troops from St. Simon’s\r\nBay to Algoa Bay, Cape Colony, and had, with crew, a total complement of\r\n638 souls on board. She struck on a reef, when steaming at the rate of\r\neight and a half knots, and almost immediately became a total wreck. The\r\nrock penetrated her bottom, just aft of the fore-mast, and the rush of\r\nwater was so great that most of the men on the lower troop-deck were\r\ndrowned in their hammocks. The commanding officer, Major Seton, called his\r\nsubordinate officers about him, and impressed upon them the necessity of\r\npreserving order and perfect discipline among the men, and of assisting\r\nthe commander of the ship in everything possible. Sixty soldiers were\r\nimmediately detailed for the pumps, in three reliefs; sixty more to hold\r\non the tackles of the paddle-box boats, and the remainder were brought on\r\nthe poop, so as to ease the fore-part of the ship, which was rolling\r\nheavily. The commander of the ship ordered the horses to be pitched out of\r\nthe first-gangway, and the cutter to be got ready for the women and\r\nchildren, who were safely put on board. Just after they were out of the\r\nship, the entire bow broke off at the fore-mast, and the funnel went over\r\nthe side, carrying away the starboard paddle-box and boat. The other\r\npaddle-box boat capsized when being lowered, and their largest boat, in\r\nthe centre of the ship, could not be got at, so encumbered was it. Five\r\nminutes later, the vessel actually “_broke in two_,” literally realising\r\nFalconer’s lines:—\r\n\r\n  “Ah, Heaven! Behold, her crashing ribs divide!\r\n  She loosens, parts, and spreads in ruin o’er the tide.”\r\n\r\n“She parted just abaft the engine-room, and the stern part immediately\r\nfilled and went down. A few men jumped off just before she did so; but the\r\ngreater number remained to the last, and so did every officer belonging to\r\nthe troops.” A number of the soldiers were crushed to death when the\r\nfunnel fell, and few of those at the pumps could reach the deck before the\r\nvessel broke up. The survivors clung, some to the rigging of the\r\nmain-mast, part of which was out of water, and others to floating pieces\r\nof wood. When the _Birkenhead_ divided into two pieces, the commander of\r\nthe ship called out, “All those who can swim, jump overboard and make for\r\nthe boats!” Two of the military officers earnestly besought their men not\r\nto do so, as, in that case, the boats with the women must be swamped; and,\r\nto the honour of the soldiers, only three made the attempt.\r\n\r\nThe struggles of a part of them to reach the shore, the weary tramp\r\nthrough a country covered with thick thorny bushes, before they could\r\nreach any farm or settlement; the sufferings of thirty or more poor\r\nfellows who were clinging, in a state of utter exhaustion, cold, and\r\nwretchedness, to the main-topmast and topsail-yard of the submerged\r\nvessel, before they were rescued by a passing schooner, have often been\r\ntold. The conduct of the troops was perfect; and it is questionable\r\nwhether there is any other instance of such thorough discipline at a time\r\nof almost utter hopelessness. The loss of life was enormous, only 192 out\r\nof 638 being saved. Had there been any panic, or mutiny, not even that\r\nsmall remnant would have escaped.\r\n\r\nTurn we now to another and a sadder case, where the opposite qualities\r\nwere most unhappily displayed, and the consequences of which were\r\nproportionately terrible.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of June, 1816, the _Medusa_, a fine French frigate, sailed\r\nfrom Aix, with troops and colonists on board, destined for the west coast\r\nof Africa. Several settlements which had previously belonged to France,\r\nbut which fell into the hands of the English during the war, were, on the\r\npeace of 1815, restored to their original owners; and it was to take\r\nre-possession that the French Government dispatched the expedition, which\r\nconsisted of two vessels, one of which was the _Medusa_. Besides infantry\r\nand artillery, officers and men, there was a governor, with priests,\r\nschoolmasters, notaries, surgeons, apothecaries, mining and other\r\nengineers, naturalists, practical agriculturists, bakers, workmen, and\r\nthirty-eight women, the whole expedition numbering 365 persons, exclusive\r\nof the ship’s officers and company. Of these the _Medusa_ took 240,\r\nmaking, with her crew and passengers, a total of 400 on board.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: THE RAFT OF THE “MEDUSA.”]\r\n\r\nAfter making Cape Blanco, the expedition had been ordered to steer due\r\nwestward to sea for some sixty miles, in order to clear a well-known\r\nsand-bank, that of Arguin. The captain, however, seems to have been an\r\nill-advised, foolhardy man, and he took a southward course. The vessel\r\nshortened sail every two hours to sound, and every half-hour the lead was\r\ncast, without slackening sail. For some little time the soundings\r\nindicated deep water, but shortly after the course had been altered to\r\nS.S.E., the colour of the water changed, seaweeds floated round the ship,\r\nand fish were caught from its sides; all indications of shallowing. But\r\nthe captain heeded not these obvious signs, and the vessel suddenly\r\ngrounded on a bank. The weather being moderate, there was no reason for\r\nalarm, and she would have been got off safely had the captain been even an\r\naverage sailor. For the time, the _Medusa_ stuck fast on the sand-bank,\r\nand as a large part of those on board were landsmen, consternation and\r\ndisorder reigned supreme, and reproaches and curses were liberally\r\nbestowed on the captain. The crew was set to work with anchors and cables\r\nto endeavour to work the vessel off. During the day, the topmasts, yards,\r\nand booms were unshipped and thrown overboard, which lightened her, but\r\nwere not sufficient to make her float. Meantime, a council was called, and\r\nthe governor of the colonies exhibited the plan of a raft, which was\r\nconsidered large enough to carry two hundred persons, with all the\r\nnecessary stores and provisions. It was to be towed by the boats, while\r\ntheir crews were to come to it at regular meal-times for their rations.\r\nThe whole party was to land in a body on the sandy shore of the\r\ncoast—known to be at no great distance—and proceed to the nearest\r\nsettlements. All this was, theoretically speaking, most admirable, and had\r\nthere been any leading spirit in command, the plan would have been, as was\r\nafterwards proved, quite practicable. The raft was immediately\r\nconstructed, principally from the spars removed from the vessel as before\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nVarious efforts were made to get the _Medusa_ off the sandbank, and at one\r\ntime she swung entirely, and turned her head to sea. She was, in fact,\r\nalmost afloat, and a tow-line applied in the usual way would have taken\r\nher into deep water; but this familiar expedient was never even proposed.\r\nOr, even had she been lightened by throwing overboard a part of her stores\r\ntemporarily—which could have been done without serious harm to many\r\narticles—she might have been saved. Half-measures were tried, and even\r\nthese were not acted on with perseverance. During the next night there was\r\na strong gale and heavy swell, and the _Medusa_ heeled over with much\r\nviolence; the keel broke in two, the rudder was unshipped, and, still\r\nholding to the stern-post by the chains, dashed against the vessel and\r\nbeat a hole into the captain’s cabin, through which the waves entered. It\r\nwas at this time that the first indications of that unruly spirit which\r\nafterwards produced so many horrors appeared among the soldiers, who\r\nassembled tumultuously on deck, and could hardly be quieted. Next morning\r\nthere were seven feet of water in the hold, and the pumps could not be\r\nworked, so that it was resolved to quit the vessel without delay. Some\r\nbags of biscuit were taken from the bread-room, and some casks of wine got\r\nready to put on the boats and raft. But there was an utter want of\r\nmanagement, and several of the boats only received twenty-five pounds of\r\nbiscuit and no wine, while the raft had a quantity of wine and no biscuit.\r\nTo avoid confusion, a list had been made the evening before, assigning to\r\neach his place. No one paid the slightest attention to it, and no one of\r\nthose in authority tried to enforce obedience to it. It was a case of\r\n“_Sauve qui peut!_” with a vengeance: a disorderly and disgraceful\r\nscramble for the best places and an utter and total disregard for the\r\nwants of others.\r\n\r\nIt is, and always has been, a point of honour for the officers to be among\r\nthe very last to leave (except, of course, where their presence might be\r\nneeded in the boats), and the captain to be the very last. Here, the\r\ncaptain was among the _first_ to scramble over the side; and his\r\ntwelve-oared barge only took off twenty-eight persons, when it would have\r\neasily carried many more. A large barge took the colonial governor and his\r\nfamily, _and_ the governor’s trunks. His boat wanted for nothing, and\r\nwould have accommodated ten or more persons than it took. When several of\r\nthe unfortunate crew swam off and begged to be taken in, they were kept\r\noff with drawn swords. The raft(59) took the larger part of the soldiers,\r\nand had in all on board one hundred and fifty persons. The captain coolly\r\nproposed to desert some sixty of the people still on board, and leave them\r\nto shift for themselves; but an officer who threatened to shoot him was\r\nthe means of making him change his mind, and over forty were taken off in\r\nthe long-boat. Seventeen men, many of whom were helplessly intoxicated,\r\nwere, however, left to their fate.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 5th of July the signal was given to put to sea, and\r\nat first some of the boats towed the raft, which had no one to command it\r\nbut a midshipman named Coudin, who, having a painful wound on his leg, was\r\nutterly useless. The other officers consulted their own personal safety\r\nonly, and, with a few exceptions, this was the case with every one else.\r\nWhen the lieutenant of the long-boat, fearing that he could not keep the\r\nsea with eighty-eight men on board, and no oars, entreated three of the\r\nother boats, one after the other, to relieve him of a part of his living\r\ncargo, they refused utterly; and the officer of the third, in his hurry to\r\nrun away, loosed from the raft. This was the signal for a general\r\ndesertion. The word was passed from one boat to another to leave them to\r\ntheir fate, and the captain had not the manliness to protest. The purser\r\nof the _Medusa_, with a few others, opposed such a dastardly proceeding,\r\nbut in vain; and the raft, without means of propulsion, was abandoned. As\r\nit proved afterwards, the boats, which all reached the land safely,\r\nsighted the coast the same evening; and the raft could have been towed to\r\nit in a day or two, or at all events sufficiently near for the purpose.\r\nThe people on it could not at first believe in this treacherous desertion,\r\nand once and again buoyed themselves up with the hope that the boats would\r\nreturn or send relief. The lieutenant on the long-boat seems to have been\r\none of the few officers possessing any spark of humanity and manliness. He\r\nkept his own boat near the raft for a time, in the hope that the others\r\nmight be induced to return, but at length had to yield to the clamour of\r\nsome eighty men on board with him, who insisted on his proceeding in\r\nsearch of land.\r\n\r\nThe consternation and despair of those on the raft beggars description.\r\nThe water was, even while the sea was calm, up to the knees of the larger\r\npart on board, while the horrors of a slow death from starvation and\r\nthirst, and the prospect of being washed off by the waves, should a storm\r\narise, stared them in the face. Several barrels of flour had been placed\r\non the raft at first, along with six barrels of wine and two small casks\r\nof water. When only fifty persons had got on it, their weight sunk it so\r\nlow in the water that the flour was thrown into the sea, and lost. When\r\nthe raft quitted the ship, with a hundred and fifty souls on her, she was\r\na foot to a foot and a half under water, and the only food on board was a\r\ntwenty-five-pound bag of biscuit, in a semi-pulpy condition, which just\r\nafforded them one meagre ration.\r\n\r\nSome on board, to keep up the courage of the remainder, promulgated the\r\nidea that the boats had merely made sail for the island of Arguin, and\r\nthat, having landed their crews, they would return. This for the moment\r\nappeased the indignation of the soldiers and others who had, with frantic\r\ngesticulations, been wringing their hands and tearing their hair. Night\r\ncame on, and the wind freshened, the waves rolling over them, and throwing\r\nmany down with violence. The cries of the people were mingled with the\r\nroar of the waves, whilst heavy seas constantly lifted them off their legs\r\nand threatened to wash them away. Thus, clinging desperately to the ropes,\r\nthey struggled with death the whole night through.\r\n\r\nAbout seven the next morning, the sea was again calm, when they found that\r\ntwelve or more unfortunate men had, during the night, slipped between the\r\ninterstices of the raft and perished. The effects of starvation were\r\nbeginning to tell upon them:(60) all their faculties were strangely\r\nimpaired. Some fancied that they saw lighted signals in the distance, and\r\nanswered them by firing off their pistols, or by setting fire to small\r\nheaps of gunpowder; others thought they saw ships or land, when there was\r\nnothing in sight. The next day strong symptoms of mutiny broke out, the\r\nofficers being utterly disregarded by the soldiers. The evening again\r\nbrought bad weather. “The people were now dashed about by the fury of the\r\nwaves; there was no safety but in the centre of the raft,” where they\r\npacked themselves so close that many were nearly suffocated. “The soldiers\r\nand sailors, now considering their destruction inevitable, resolved to\r\ndrown the sense of their situation by drinking till they should lose their\r\nreason;” nor could they be persuaded to forego their mad scheme. They\r\nrushed upon a cask of wine which was near the centre, and making a hole in\r\nit, drank so much, that the fumes soon mounted to their heads, in the\r\nempty condition in which they were; and “they then resolved to rid\r\nthemselves of their officers, and afterwards to destroy the raft by\r\ncutting the lashings which kept it together.” One of them commenced\r\nhacking away at the ropes with a boarding-hatchet. The civil and military\r\nofficers rushed on this ringleader, and though he made a desperate\r\nresistance, soon dispatched him. The people on the raft were now divided\r\ninto two antagonistic parties—about twenty civil officers and the better\r\nclass of passengers on one side, and a hundred or more soldiers and\r\nworkmen on the other. “The mutineers,” says the narrative, “drew their\r\nswords, and were going to make a general attack, when the fall of another\r\nof their number struck such a seasonable terror into them that they\r\nretreated; but it was only to make another attempt at cutting the ropes.\r\nOne of them, pretending to rest on the side-rail of the raft, began to\r\nwork;” when he was discovered, and a few moments afterwards, with a\r\nsoldier who attempted to defend him, was sent to his last account. This\r\nwas followed by a general fight. An infantry captain was thrown into the\r\nsea by the soldiers, but rescued by his friends. He was then seized a\r\nsecond time, and the revolters attempted to put out his eyes. A charge was\r\nmade upon them, and many put to death. The wretches threw overboard the\r\nonly woman on the raft, together with her husband. They were, however,\r\nsaved, only to die miserably soon afterwards.\r\n\r\nA second repulse brought many of the mutineers to their senses, and\r\ntemporarily awed the rest, some asking pardon on their knees. But at\r\nmidnight the revolt again broke out, the soldiers attacking the party in\r\nthe centre of the raft with the fury of madmen, even biting their\r\nadversaries. They seized upon one of the lieutenants, mistaking him for\r\none of the ship’s officers who had deserted the raft, and he was rescued\r\nand protected afterwards with the greatest difficulty. They threw\r\noverboard M. Coudin, an elderly man, who was covered with wounds received\r\nin opposing them, and a young boy of the party, in whom he took an\r\ninterest. M. Coudin had the presence of mind both to support the child and\r\nto take hold of the raft; and his friends kept off the brutal soldiery\r\nwith drawn swords, until they were lifted on board again. The combat was\r\nso fierce, and the weather at night so bad, that on the return of day it\r\nwas found that over sixty had perished off the raft. It is stated that the\r\nmutineers had thrown over the remaining water and two casks of wine. The\r\nindications in the narrative would not point to the latter conclusion, as\r\nthe soldiers and workmen were constantly intoxicated, and many, no doubt,\r\nwere washed off by the waves in that condition. A powerful temperance\r\ntract might be written on the loss of the _Medusa_. On the morning of the\r\nfourth day after their departure from the frigate, the dead bodies of\r\ntwelve of the company, who had expired during the night, were lying on the\r\nraft. This day a shoal of flying-fish played round the raft, and a number\r\nof them got on board,(61) and were entangled in the spaces between the\r\ntimbers. A small fire, lighted with flint and steel and gunpowder, was\r\nmade inside a barrel, and the fish, half-cooked, was greedily devoured.\r\nThey did not stop here; the account briefly indicates that they ate parts\r\nof the flesh of their dead companions. Horror followed horror: a massacre\r\nsucceeded their savage feast. Some Spaniards, Italians, and negroes among\r\nthem, who had hitherto taken no part with the mutineers, now formed a plot\r\nto throw their superiors into the sea. A bag of money, which had been\r\ncollected as a common fund, and was hanging from a rude mast hastily\r\nextemporised, probably tempted them. The officers’ party threw their\r\nringleader overboard, while another of the conspirators, finding his\r\nvillainy discovered, weighted himself with a heavy boarding-axe, and\r\nrushing to the fore part of the raft, plunged headlong into the sea and\r\nwas drowned. A desperate combat ensued, and the fatal raft was quickly\r\npiled with dead bodies.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth morning, there were only thirty alive. The remnant suffered\r\nseverely, and one-third of the number were unable to stand up or move\r\nabout. The salt water and intense heat of the sun blistered their feet and\r\nlegs, and gave intense pain. In the course of the seventh day, two\r\nsoldiers were discovered stealing the wine, and they were immediately\r\npushed overboard. This day also, Leon, the poor little boy mentioned\r\nbefore, died from sheer starvation.\r\n\r\nThe story has been so far nothing but a record of insubordination,\r\nmurderous brutality, and utter selfishness. But the worst has yet to come.\r\nLet the survivors tell their own shameful and horrible story. There were\r\nnow but twenty-seven left, and “of these twelve, amongst them the woman,\r\nwere so ill that there was no hope of their surviving, even a few days;\r\nthey were covered with wounds, and had almost entirely lost their\r\nreason.... They might have lived long enough to reduce our stock to a very\r\nlow ebb; but there was no hope that they could last more than a few days.\r\nTo put them on short allowance was only hastening their death; while\r\ngiving them a full ration, was uselessly diminishing a quantity already\r\ntoo low. After an anxious consultation, we came to the resolution of\r\nthrowing them into the sea, and thus terminating at once their sufferings.\r\nThis was a horrible and unjustifiable expedient, but who amongst us would\r\nhave the cruelty to put it into execution? Three sailors and a soldier\r\ntook it on themselves. We turned away our eyes from the shocking sight,\r\ntrusting that, in thus endeavouring to prolong our own lives, we were\r\nshortening theirs but a few hours. This gave us the means of subsistence\r\nfor six additional days. After this dreadful sacrifice, we cast our swords\r\ninto the sea, reserving but one sabre for cutting wood or cordage, as\r\nmight be necessary.” Was there ever such an example of demoniacal\r\nhypocrisy, mingled with pretended humanity!\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: ON THE RAFT OF THE “MEDUSA”—A SAIL IN SIGHT.\r\n             (_After the celebrated Painting by Géricault._)]\r\n\r\nOne can hardly interest himself in the fate of the remaining fifteen, who,\r\nif they were not all human devils, must have carried to their dying days\r\nthe brand of Cain indelibly impressed on their memories. A few days\r\npassed, and the indications of a close approach to land became frequent.\r\nMeantime, they were suffering from the intense heat, and from excessive\r\nthirst. One more example of petty selfishness was afforded by an officer\r\nwho had found a lemon, which he resolved to keep entirely for himself,\r\nuntil the ominous threats of the rest obliged him to share it. The wine,\r\nwhich should have warmed their bodies and gladdened their hearts, produced\r\non their weakened frames the worst effects of intoxication. Five of the\r\nnumber resolved, and were barely persuaded not to commit suicide, so\r\nmaddened were they by their potations. Perhaps the sight of the sharks,\r\nwhich now came boldly up to the edges of the raft, had something to do\r\nwith sobering them, for they decided to live.\r\n\r\nThree days now passed in intolerable torments. They had become so careless\r\nof life, that they bathed even in sight of the sharks; others were not\r\nafraid to place themselves naked upon the fore part of the raft, which was\r\nthen entirely under water; and, though it was exceedingly dangerous, it\r\nhad the effect of taking away their thirst. They now attempted to\r\nconstruct a boat of planks and spars. When completed, a sailor went upon\r\nit, when it immediately upset, and the design of reaching land by this\r\nmeans was abandoned. On the morning of the 17th of July, the sun shone\r\nbrightly and the sky was cloudless. Just as they were receiving their\r\nration of wine, one of the infantry officers discerned the topmasts of a\r\nvessel near the horizon. Uniting their efforts, they raised a man to the\r\ntop of the mast, who waved constantly a number of handkerchiefs tied\r\ntogether. After two hours of painful suspense, the vessel, a brig,\r\ndisappeared, and they once more resigned themselves to despair. Deciding\r\nthat they must leave some record of their fate, they agreed to carve their\r\nnames, with some account of their disaster, on a plank, in the hope that\r\nit might eventually reach their Government and families. But they were to\r\nbe saved: the brig reappeared, and bore down for them. She proved to be a\r\nvessel which had been dispatched by the Governor of Senegal for the\r\npurpose of rescuing any survivors; though, considering the raft had now\r\nbeen seventeen days afloat, there was little expectation that any of its\r\nhundred and fifty passengers still lived. The wounded and blistered limbs,\r\nsunken eyes, and emaciated frames of the remnant told its own tale on\r\nboard. And yet, with due order and discipline, presence of mind, and\r\nunited helpfulness, the ship, with every soul who had sailed on her, might\r\nhave been saved; and a fearful story of cruelty, murder, and cannibalism\r\nspared to us. The modern _Medusa_ has been branded with a name of infamy\r\nworse than that of the famous classical monster after which she was named.\r\nThe celebrated picture by Géricault in the Louvre, at Paris, vividly\r\ndepicts the horrors of the scene.\r\n\r\nThe wreck of the _Medusa_ has very commonly been compared and contrasted\r\nwith that of the _Alceste_, an English frigate, which was wrecked the same\r\nyear. Lord Amherst was returning from China in this vessel, after\r\nfulfilling his mission to the Court of Pekin, instituted at the instance\r\nof the East India Company, who had complained to Government of the\r\nimpediments thrown in the way of their trade by the Chinese. His secretary\r\nand suite were with him; and so there was some resemblance to the case of\r\nthe _Medusa_, which had a colonial governor and his staff on board. The\r\ncommander of the _Alceste_ was Captain (afterwards Sir) Murray Maxwell, a\r\ntrue gentleman and a bluff, hearty sailor. Having touched at Manilla, they\r\nwere passing through the Straits of Gaspar, when the ship suddenly struck\r\non a reef of sunken rocks, and it became evident that she must inevitably\r\nand speedily break up. The most perfect discipline prevailed; and the\r\nfirst efforts of the captain were naturally directed to saving the\r\nambassador and his subordinates. The island of Palo Leat was a few miles\r\noff; and, although its coast at this part was a salt-marsh, with\r\nmangrove-trees growing out in the water so thick and entangled that it\r\nalmost prevented them landing, every soul was got off safely. Good feeling\r\nand sensible councils prevailed. At first there was no fresh water to be\r\nobtained. It was\r\n\r\n  “Water, water everywhere,\r\n  Yet not a drop to drink.”\r\n\r\nIn a short time, however, they dug a deep well, and soon reached plenty.\r\nThen the Malays attacked and surrounded them; at first a few score, at\r\nlast six or seven hundred strong. Things looked black; but they erected a\r\nstockade, made rude pikes by sticking their knives, dirks, and small\r\nswords on the end of poles; and, although they had landed with just\r\nseventy-five ball-cartridges, their stock soon grew to fifteen hundred.\r\nHow? Why, the sailors set to with a will, and made their own, the balls\r\nbeing represented by their jacket-buttons and pieces of the glass of\r\nbroken bottles! Of loose powder they had, fortunately, a sufficient\r\nquantity. The Malays set the wreck on fire. The men waited till it had\r\nburned low, and then drove them off, and went and secured such of the\r\nstores as could be now reached, or which had floated off. The natives were\r\ngathering thick. Murray made his sailors a speech in true hearty style,\r\nand their wild huzzas were taken by the Malays for war-whoops: the latter\r\nsoon “weakened,” as they say in America. From the highest officer to the\r\nmerest boy, all behaved like calm, resolute, and sensible Britons, and\r\nevery soul was saved. Lord Amherst, who had gone on to Batavia, sent a\r\nvessel for them, on board which Maxwell was the last to embark. At the\r\ntime of the wreck their condition was infinitely worse than that of the\r\n_Medusa_; but how completely different the sequel! The story is really a\r\npleasant one, displaying, as it does, the happy results of both good\r\ndiscipline and mutual good feeling in the midst of danger. _Nil\r\ndesperandum_ was evidently the motto of that crew; and their philosophy\r\nwas rewarded. The lessons of the past and present, in regard to our great\r\nships, have taught us that disaster is not confined to ironclads, nor\r\nvictory to wooden walls; neither is good discipline dead, nor the race of\r\ntrue-hearted tars extinct. “Men of iron” will soon be the worthy\r\nsuccessors of “hearts of oak.”\r\n\r\nHaving glanced at the causes which led to the ironclad movement, and noted\r\ncertain salient points in its history, let us now for a while discuss the\r\nironclad herself. It has been remarked, as a matter of reproach to the\r\nadministrators and builders of the British ironclad navy, that the vessels\r\ncomposing it are not sufficiently uniform in design, power, and speed. Mr.\r\nReed, however, tells us that _la marine moderne cuirassée_ of France is\r\nstill more distinguished by the different types and forms of the vessels;\r\nand that ours by comparison wears “quite a tiresome appearance of\r\nsameness;” while, again, Russia has ironclads even more diversified than\r\nthose of France. The objection is, perhaps, hardly a fair one, as the\r\nexigencies of the navy are many and varied. We might have to fight a\r\nfirst-class power, or several first-class powers, where all our strength\r\nwould have to be put forth; some second-class power might require\r\nchastising, where vessels of a secondary class might suffice; while almost\r\nany vessel of the navy would be efficient in the case of wars with native\r\ntribes, as, for example, the Maories of New Zealand, or the Indians of the\r\ncoasts of North-west America. In a great naval conflict, provided the\r\nvessels of our fleet steamed pretty evenly as regards speed, there would\r\nbe an advantage in variety; for it might rather puzzle and worry the\r\nenemy, who would not know what next would appear, or what new form turn\r\nup. Mr. Reed puts the matter in a nutshell; although it must be seen that,\r\namong first-class powers with first-class fleets, the argument cuts both\r\nways. “In the old days,” says he, “when actions had to be fought under\r\nsail, and when ships of a class were in the main alike, the limits within\r\nwhich the arts, the resources, and the audacities of the navy were\r\nrestricted were really very narrow; and yet how brilliant were its\r\nachievements! I cannot but believe that, if the English ironclad fleet\r\nwere now to be engaged in a general action with an enemy’s fleet, the very\r\nvariety of our ships—those very improvements which have occasioned that\r\nvariety—would be at once the cause of the greatest possible embarrassment\r\nto the enemy, and the means of the most vigorous and diversified attack\r\nupon the hostile fleet. This is peculiarly true of all those varieties\r\nwhich result from increase in handiness, in bow-fire, in height of port,\r\nand so forth; and unless I have mis-read our naval history, and\r\nmisappreciate the character of our naval officers of the present day, the\r\nnation will, in the day of trial, obtain the full benefit of these\r\nadvantages.”\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: SECTION OF A FIRST-CLASS MAN-OF-WAR.]\r\n\r\nIt needs no argument to convince the reader that the aim of a naval\r\narchitect should be to combine in the best manner available, strength and\r\nlightness. The dimensions and outside form of the ship in great part\r\ndetermine her displacement; and her capacity to carry weights depends\r\nlargely on the actual weight of her own hull; while the room within partly\r\ndepends on the thinness or thickness of her walls. Now, we have seen that\r\nin wooden ships the hull weighs more than in iron ships of equal size; and\r\nit will be apparent that what is gained in the latter case can be applied\r\nto _carrying_ so much the more iron armour. Hence, distinguished\r\nauthorities do not believe in the wood-built ship _carrying_ heavy armour,\r\nnearly so much as in the ironclad, iron-_built_ ship.(62) The durability\r\nand strength are greater. The authority of such a man as Mr. J. Scott\r\nRussell, the eminent shipbuilder, will be conclusive. In a pamphlet,(63)\r\npublished in 1862, he noted the following ten points: 1, That iron steam\r\nships-of-war may be built as strong as wooden ships of greater weight, and\r\nstronger than wooden ships of equal weight. 2, That iron ships of equal\r\nstrength can go on less draught of water than wooden ships. 3, That iron\r\nships can carry much heavier weights than wooden ships [hence they can\r\ncarry heavier armour]. 4, That they are more durable. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, That\r\nthey are safer against the sea, against fire, explosive shots, red-hot\r\nshots, molten metal; and 10, That they can be made impregnable even\r\nagainst solid shot.\r\n\r\n                      [Illustration: THE “WARRIOR.”]\r\n\r\nThe last point, alas! is one which Mr. Scott Russell himself would hardly\r\ninsist upon to-day. When he wrote his pamphlet, five or six inches of\r\narmour, with a wood backing, withstood anything that could be fired\r\nagainst it. When the armour of the _Warrior_, our first real ironclad, had\r\nto be tested, a target, twenty feet by ten feet surface, composed of four\r\nand a half inch iron and eighteen inches of teak backing—the exact\r\ncounterpart of a slice out of the ship’s side—was employed. The shot from\r\n68-pounders—the same as composed her original armament—fired at 200 yards,\r\nonly made small dents in the target and rebounded. 200-pounders had no\r\nmore effect; the shot flew off in ragged splinters, the iron plates became\r\nalmost red-hot under the tremendous strokes, and rung like a huge gong;\r\nbut that was all. Now we have 6½-ton guns that would pierce her side at\r\n500 yards; 12-ton guns that would put a hole through her armour at over a\r\nmile, and 25-ton guns that would probably penetrate the armour of any\r\nironclad whatever. Why, some of the ships themselves are now carrying\r\n30-ton guns! It is needless to go on and speak of monster 81 and 100-ton\r\nguns after recording these facts. But their consideration explains why the\r\nthickness of armour has kept on increasing, albeit it could not possibly\r\ndo so in an equal ratio.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed tells us: “This strange contest between attack and defence,\r\nhowever wasteful, however melancholy, must still go on.”(64) Sir W. G.\r\nArmstrong (inventor of the famous guns), on the other hand, says, “In my\r\nopinion, armour should be wholly abandoned for the defence of the guns,\r\nand, except to a very limited extent, I doubt the expediency of using it\r\neven for the security of the ship. Where armour can be applied for\r\n_deflecting_ projectiles, as at the bow of a ship, it would afford great\r\nprotection, without requiring to be very heavy.”(65) Sir William\r\nrecommends very swift iron vessels, divided into numerous compartments,\r\nwith boilers and machinery below the water-line, and only very partially\r\nprotected by armour; considering that victory in the contest as regards\r\nstrength is entirely on the side of the artillery. Sir Joseph Whitworth\r\n(also an inventor of great guns) offered practically to make guns to\r\npenetrate _any_ thickness of armour. The bewildered Parliamentary\r\ncommittee says mournfully in its report: “A perfect ship of war is a\r\ndesideratum which has never yet been attained, and is now farther than\r\never removed from our reach;”(66) while Mr. Reed(67) again cuts the\r\ngordian knot by professing his belief that in the end, “guns will\r\nthemselves be superseded as a means of attack, and the ship itself, viewed\r\nas a steam projectile—possessing all the force of the most powerful shot,\r\ncombined with the power of striking in various directions—will be deemed\r\nthe most formidable weapon of attack that man’s ingenuity has devised.”\r\nThe contest between professed ship and gun makers would be amusing but for\r\nthe serious side—the immense expense, and the important interests\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR: FROM THE MAINLAND.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ROUND THE WORLD ON A MAN-OF-WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Mediterranean—White, blue, green, purple Waters—Gibraltar—Its\r\n      History—Its first Inhabitants the Monkeys—The Moors—The Great\r\n    Siege preceded by thirteen others—The Voyage of Sigurd to the Holy\r\n      Land—The Third Siege—Starvation—The Fourth Siege—Red-hot balls\r\n       used before ordinary Cannon-balls—The Great Plague—Gibraltar\r\n     finally in Christian hands—A Naval Action between the Dutch and\r\n      Spaniards—How England won the Rock—An Unrewarded Hero—Spain’s\r\n      attempts to regain It—The Great Siege—The Rock itself and its\r\n    Surroundings—The Straits—Ceuta, Gibraltar’s Rival—The Saltness of\r\n               the Mediterranean—“Going aloft”—On to Malta.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this and following chapters, we will ask the reader to accompany us in\r\nimagination round the world, on board a ship of the Royal Navy, visiting\r\n_en route_ the principal British naval stations and possessions, and a few\r\nof those friendly foreign ports which, as on the Pacific station, stand in\r\nlieu of them. We cannot do better than commence with the Mediterranean, to\r\nwhich the young sailor will, in all probability, be sent for a cruise\r\nafter he has been thoroughly “broken in” to the mysteries of life on board\r\nship, and where he has an opportunity of visiting many ports of ancient\r\nrenown and of great historical interest.\r\n\r\nThe modern title applied to the sea “between the lands” is not that of the\r\nancients, nor indeed that of some peoples now. The Greeks had no special\r\nname for it. Herodotus calls it “this sea;” and Strabo the “sea within the\r\ncolumns,” that is, within Calpe and Abyla—the fabled pillars of\r\nHercules—to-day represented by Gibraltar and Ceuta. The Romans called it\r\nvariously _Mare Internum_ and _Mare Nostrum_, while the Arabians termed it\r\n_Bahr Rüm_—the Roman Sea. The modern Greeks call it _Aspri Thalassa_—the\r\nWhite Sea; it might as appropriately be called blue, that being its\r\ngeneral colour, or green, as in the Adriatic, or purple, as at its eastern\r\nend: but they use it to distinguish it from the “Sea of Storms”—the Black\r\nSea. The Straits—“the Gate of the Narrow Passage,” as the Arabians\r\npoetically describe it, or the _Gut_, as it is termed by our prosaic\r\nsailors and pilots—is the narrow portal to a great inland sea with an area\r\nof 800,000 miles, whose shores are as varied in character as are the\r\npeoples who own them. The Mediterranean is salter than the ocean, in spite\r\nof the great rivers which enter it—the Rhone, Po, Ebro, and Nile—and the\r\ninnumerable smaller streams and torrents.(68) It has other physical and\r\nspecial characteristics, to be hereafter considered.\r\n\r\nThe political and social events which have been mingled with its history\r\nare interwoven with those of almost every people on the face of the globe.\r\nWe shall see how much our own has been shaped and involved. It was with\r\nthe memory of the glorious deeds of British seamen and soldiers that\r\nBrowning wrote, when sailing through the Straits:—\r\n\r\n  “Nobly, nobly, Cape St. Vincent to the north-west died away;\r\n  Sunset ran, one glorious blood-red, reeking into Cadiz Bay;\r\n  Bluish, ’mid the burning water, full in face Trafalgar lay;\r\n  In the dimmest north-east distance dawned Gibraltar, grand and gray;\r\n  ‘Here, and here, did England help me—how can I help England?’—say\r\n  Whoso turns as I, this evening, turns to God to praise and pray,\r\n  While Jove’s planet rises yonder, silent over Africa.”\r\n\r\nAnd the poet is almost literally correct in his description, for within\r\nsight, as we enter the Straits of Gibraltar, are the localities of\r\ninnumerable sea and land fights dating from earliest days. That grand old\r\nRock, what has it not witnessed since the first timid mariner crept out of\r\nthe Mediterranean into the Atlantic—the _Mare Tenebrosum_,—the “sea of\r\ndarkness” of the ancients? Romans of old fought Carthaginian galleys in\r\nits bay; the conquering Moors held it uninterruptedly for six hundred\r\nyears, and in all for over seven centuries; Spain owned it close on two\r\nand a half centuries; and England has dared the world to take it since\r\n1704—one hundred and seventy-three years ago. Its very armorial bearings,\r\nwhich we have adopted from those given by Henry of Castile and Leon, are\r\nsuggestive of its position and value: a castle on a rock with a key\r\npendant—the key to the Mediterranean. The King of Spain still includes\r\nCalpe (Gibraltar) in his dominions; and natives of the place, Ford tells\r\nus, in his “Handbook to Spain,” are entitled to the rights and privileges\r\nof Spanish birth. It has, in days gone by, given great offence to French\r\nwriters, who spoke of _l’ombrageuse puissance_ with displeasure.\r\n“Sometimes,” says Ford, “there is too great a _luxe de canons_ in this\r\nfortress _ornée_; then the gardens destroy ‘wild nature;’ in short, they\r\nabuse the red-jackets, guns, nursery-maids, and even the monkeys.” The\r\npresent colony of apes are the descendants of the aboriginal inhabitants\r\nof the Rock. They have held it through all vicissitudes.\r\n\r\nThe Moorish writers were ever enthusiastic over it. With them it was “the\r\nShining Mountain,” “the Mountain of Victory.” “The Mountain of Taric”(69)\r\n(Gibraltar), says a Granadian poet, “is like a beacon spreading its rays\r\nover the sea, and rising far above the neighbouring mountains; one might\r\nfancy that its face almost reaches the sky, and that its eyes are watching\r\nthe stars in the celestial track.” An Arabian writer well describes its\r\nposition:—“The waters surround Gibraltar on almost every side, so as to\r\nmake it look like a watch-tower in the midst of the sea.”\r\n\r\nThe fame of the last great siege, already briefly described in these\r\npages,(70) has so completely overshadowed the general history of the Rock\r\nthat it will surprise many to learn that it has undergone no less than\r\nfourteen sieges. The Moors, after successfully invading Spain, first\r\nfortified it in 711, and held uninterrupted possession until 1309, when\r\nFerdinand IV. besieged and took it. The Spaniards only held it twenty-five\r\nyears, when it reverted to the Moors, who kept it till 1462. “Thus the\r\nMoors held it in all about seven centuries and a quarter, from the making\r\na castle on the Rock to the last sorrowful departure of the remnants of\r\nthe nation. It has been said that Gibraltar was the landing-place of the\r\nvigorous Moorish race, and that it was the point of departure on which\r\ntheir footsteps lingered last. In short, it was the European _tête de\r\npont_, of which Ceuta stands as the African fellow. By these means myriads\r\nof Moslems passed into Spain, and with them much for which the Spaniards\r\nare wrongfully unthankful. It is said that when the Moors left their\r\nhouses in Granada, which they did with, so to speak, everything standing,\r\nmany families took with them the great wooden keys of their mansions, so\r\nconfident were they of returning home again, when the keys should open the\r\nlocks and the houses be joyful anew. It was not to be as thus longed for;\r\nbut many families in Barbary still keep the keys of these long ago\r\ndeserted and destroyed mansions.”(71) And now we must mention an incident\r\nof its history, recorded in the “Norwegian Chronicles of the Kings,”\r\nconcerning Sigurd the Crusader—the Pilgrim. After battling his way from\r\nthe North, with sixty “long ships,” King Sigurd proceeded on his voyage to\r\nthe Holy Land, “and came to Niörfa Sound (Gibraltar Straits), and in the\r\nSound he was met by a large viking force (squadron of war-ships), and the\r\nKing gave them battle; and this was his fifth engagement with heathens\r\nsince the time he came from Norway. So says Halldor Skualldre:—\r\n\r\n  “‘He moistened your dry swords with blood,\r\n  As through Niörfa Sound ye stood;\r\n  The screaming raven got a feast,\r\n  As ye sailed onwards to the East.’\r\n\r\nHence he went along Sarkland, or Saracen’s Land, Mauritania, where he\r\nattacked a strong party, who had their fortress in a cave, with a wall\r\nbefore it, in the face of a precipice: a place which was difficult to come\r\nat, and where the holders, who are said to have been freebooters, defied\r\nand ridiculed the Northmen, spreading their valuables on the top of the\r\nwall in their sight. Sigurd was equal to the occasion in craft as in\r\nforce, for he had his ships’ boats drawn up the hill, filled them with\r\narchers and slingers, and lowered them before the mouth of the cavern, so\r\nthat they were able to keep back the defenders long enough to allow the\r\nmain body of the Northmen to ascend from the foot of the cliff and break\r\ndown the wall. This done, Sigurd caused large trees to be brought to the\r\nmouth of the cave, and roasted the miserable wretches within.” Further\r\nfights, and he at last reached Jerusalem, where he was honourably received\r\nby Baldwin, whom he assisted with his ships at the siege of Sidon. Sigurd\r\nalso visited Constantinople, where the Emperor Alexius offered him his\r\nchoice: either to receive six skif-pound (or about a _ton_ of gold), or\r\nsee the great games of the hippodrome. The Northman wisely chose the\r\nlatter, the cost of which was said to be equal to the value of the gold\r\noffered. Sigurd presented his ships to the Emperor, and their splendid\r\nprows were hung up in the church of St. Peter, at Constantinople.\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: GIBRALTAR: THE NEUTRAL GROUND.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1319, Pedro, Infante of Castile, fought the Moors at Granada.\r\nThe latter were the victors, and their spoils were enormous, consisting in\r\npart of forty-three hundredweights of gold, one hundred and forty\r\nhundredweights of silver, with armour, arms, and horses in abundance.\r\nFifty thousand Castilians were slain, and among the captives were the wife\r\nand children of the Infante. Gibraltar, then in the hands of Spain, with\r\nTarifa and eighteen castles of the district, were offered, and refused for\r\nher ransom. The body of the Infante himself was stripped of its skin, and\r\nstuffed and hung over the gate of Granada.\r\n\r\nThe third siege occurred in the reign of Mohammed IV., when the Spanish\r\nheld the Rock. The governor at that time, Vasco Perez de Meira, was an\r\navaricious and dishonest man, who embezzled the dues and other resources\r\nof the place and neglected his charge. During the siege, a grain-ship fell\r\non shore,(72) and its cargo would have enabled him to hold out a long\r\ntime. Instead of feeding his soldiers, who were reduced to eating leather,\r\nhe gave and sold it to his prisoners, with the expectation of either\r\ngetting heavy ransoms for them, or, if he should have to surrender, of\r\nmaking better terms for himself. It availed him nothing, for he had to\r\ncapitulate; and then, not daring to face his sovereign, Alfonso XI., he\r\nhad to flee to Africa, where he ended his days.\r\n\r\nAlfonso besieged it twice. The first time the Granadians induced him to\r\nabandon it, promising a heavy ransom; the next time he commenced by\r\nreducing the neighbouring town of Algeciras, which was defended with great\r\nenergy. When the Spaniards brought forward their wheeled towers of wood,\r\ncovered with raw hides, the Moors discharged cannon loaded with _red-hot_\r\nballs. This is noteworthy, for cannon was not used by the English till\r\nthree years after, at the battle of Creçy, while it is the first recorded\r\ninstance of _red-hot_ shot being used at all.(73) It is further deserving\r\nof notice, that the very means employed at Algeciras were afterwards so\r\nsuccessfully used at the great siege. After taking Algeciras, Alfonso\r\nblockaded Gibraltar, when the plague broke out in his camp; he died from\r\nit, and the Rock remained untaken. This was the epoch of one of those\r\ngreat pestilences which ravaged Europe. Fifty thousand souls perished in\r\nLondon in 1348 from its effects; Florence lost two-thirds of her\r\npopulation; in Saragossa three hundred died daily. The sixth attack on the\r\npart of the King of Fez was unsuccessful; as was that in 1436, when it was\r\nbesieged by a wealthy noble—one of the De Gusmans. His forces were allowed\r\nto land in numbers on a narrow beach below the fortress, where they were\r\nsoon exposed to the rising of the tide and the missiles of the besieged.\r\nDe Gusman was drowned, and his body, picked up by the Moors, hung out for\r\ntwenty-six years from the battlements, as a warning to ambitious nobles.\r\n\r\nAt the eighth siege, in 1462, Gibraltar passed finally into Christian\r\nhands. The garrison was weak and the Spaniards gained an easy victory.\r\nWhen Henry IV. learned of its capture, he rejoiced greatly, and took\r\nimmediate care to proclaim it a fief of the throne, adding to the royal\r\ntitles that of Lord of Gibraltar. The armorial distinctions still borne by\r\nGibraltar were first granted by him. The ninth siege, on the part of a De\r\nGusman, was successful, and it for a time passed into the hands of a noble\r\nwho had vast possessions and fisheries in the neighbourhood. Strange to\r\nsay, such were the troubles of Spain at the time, that Henry the\r\nbefore-named, who was known as “the Weak,” two years after confirmed the\r\ntitle to the Rock to the son of the very man who had been constantly in\r\narms against him. But after the civil wars, and at the advent of Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella, there was a decided change. Isabella, acting doubtless under\r\nthe advice of her astute husband, whose entire policy was opposed to such\r\naggrandisement on the part of a subject, tried to induce the duke to\r\nsurrender it, offering in exchange the City of Utrera. Ayala(74) tells us\r\nthat he utterly refused. His great estates were protected by it, and he\r\nmade it a kind of central depôt for his profitable tunny fisheries. He\r\ndied in 1492, and the third duke applied to Isabella for a renewal of his\r\ngrant and privileges. She promised all, but insisted that the Rock and\r\nfortress must revert to the Crown. But it was not till nine years\r\nafterwards that Isabella succeeded in compelling or inducing the Duke to\r\nsurrender it formally. Dying in 1504, the queen testified her wishes as\r\nfollows:—“It is my will and desire, insomuch as the city of Gibraltar has\r\nbeen surrendered to the Royal Crown, and been inserted among its titles,\r\nthat it shall for ever so remain.” Two years after her death, Juan de\r\nGusman tried to retake it, and blockaded it for four months, at the end of\r\nwhich time he abandoned the siege, and had to make reparation to those\r\nwhose property had been injured. This is the only bloodless one among the\r\nfourteen sieges.\r\n\r\nIn 1540 a dash was made at the town, and even at a part of the fortress,\r\nby Corsairs. They plundered the neighbourhood, burned a chapel and\r\nhermitage, and dictated terms in the most high-handed way—that all the\r\nTurkish prisoners should be released, and that their galleys should be\r\nallowed to take water at the Gibraltar wells. They were afterwards\r\nseverely chastised by a Spanish fleet.\r\n\r\nIn the wars between the Dutch and Spaniards a naval action occurred, in\r\nthe year 1607, in the port of Gibraltar, which can hardly be omitted in\r\nits history. The great Sully has described it graphically when speaking of\r\nthe efforts of the Dutch to secure the alliance of his master, Henry IV.\r\nof France, in their wars against Philip of Spain. He says: “Alvares\r\nd’Avila, the Spanish admiral, was ordered to cruise near the Straits of\r\nGibraltar, to hinder the Dutch from entering the Mediterranean, and to\r\ndeprive them of the trade of the Adriatic. The Dutch, to whom this was a\r\nmost sensible mortification, gave the command of ten or twelve vessels to\r\none of their ablest seamen, named Heemskerk, with the title of\r\nvice-admiral, and ordered him to go and reconnoitre this fleet, and attack\r\nit. D’Avila, though nearly twice as strong as his enemy, yet provided a\r\nreinforcement of twenty-six great ships, some of which were of a thousand\r\ntons burden, and augmented the number of his troops to three thousand five\r\nhundred men. With this accession of strength he thought himself so secure\r\nof victory that he brought a hundred and fifty gentlemen along with him\r\nonly to be witnesses of it. However, instead of standing out to sea, as he\r\nought to have done, he posted himself under the town and castle of\r\nGibraltar, that he might not be obliged to fight but when he thought\r\nproper.\r\n\r\n“Heemskerk, who had taken none of these precautions, no sooner perceived\r\nthat his enemy seemed to fear him than he advanced to attack him, and\r\nimmediately began the most furious battle that was ever fought in the\r\nmemory of man. It lasted eight whole hours. The Dutch vice-admiral, at the\r\nbeginning, attacked the vessel in which the Spanish admiral was, grappled\r\nwith, and was ready to board her. A cannon-ball, which wounded him in the\r\nthigh soon after the fight began, left him only a hour’s life, during\r\nwhich, and till within a moment of his death, he continued to give orders\r\nas if he felt no pain. When he found himself ready to expire, he delivered\r\nhis sword to his lieutenant, obliging him and all that were with him to\r\nbind themselves by an oath either to conquer or die. The lieutenant caused\r\nthe same oath to be taken by the people of all the other vessels, when\r\nnothing was heard but a general cry of ‘Victory or Death!’ At length the\r\nDutch were victorious; they lost only two vessels, and about two hundred\r\nand fifty men; the Spaniards lost sixteen ships, three were consumed by\r\nfire, and the others, among which was the admiral’s ship, ran aground.\r\nD’Avila, with thirty-five captains, fifty of his volunteers, and two\r\nthousand eight hundred soldiers, lost their lives in the fight; a\r\nmemorable action, which was not only the source of tears and affliction to\r\nmany widows and private persons, but filled all Spain with horror.”(75)\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: MOORISH TOWER AT GIBRALTAR.]\r\n\r\nEngland won Gibraltar during the War of the Succession, when she was\r\nallied with Austria and Holland against Spain and France. The war had\r\ndragged on with varied results till 1704, when it was determined to attack\r\nSpain at home with the aid of the Portuguese. The commanders of the allied\r\nfleets and troops—_i.e._, the Landgrave George of Hesse-Darmstadt, Sir\r\nGeorge Rooke, Admiral Byng, Sir Cloudesley Shovel, Admiral Leake, and the\r\nthree Dutch admirals—determined to attack Gibraltar, believed to be weak\r\nin forces and stores. On the 21st of July, 1704, the fleet, which\r\nconsisted of forty-five ships, six frigates, besides fire and bomb-ships,\r\ncame to an anchor off the Rock, and landed 5,000 men, so as to at once cut\r\noff the supplies of the garrison. The commanders of the allied forces\r\nsent, on the morning after their arrival, a demand for the surrender of\r\nGibraltar to the Archduke Charles, whose claims as rightful King of Spain\r\nthey were supporting. The little garrison(76) answered valiantly; and had\r\ntheir brave governor, the Marquis Diego de Salinas, been properly backed,\r\nthe fortress might have been Spain’s to-day. The opening of the contest\r\nwas signalised by the burning of a French privateer, followed by a furious\r\ncannonading: the new and old moles were speedily silenced, and large\r\nnumbers of marines landed. The contest was quite unequal, and the besieged\r\nsoon offered to capitulate with the honours of war, the right of retaining\r\ntheir property, and six days’ provisions. The garrison had three days\r\nallowed for its departure, and those, as well as the inhabitants of the\r\nRock, who chose, might remain, with full civil and religious rights. Thus,\r\nin three days’ time the famous fortress fell into the hands of the allies,\r\nand possession was taken in the name of Charles III. Sir George Rooke,\r\nhowever, over-rode this, and pulled down the standard of Charles, setting\r\nup in its stead that of England. A garrison of 1,800 English seamen was\r\nlanded. The English were, alone of the parties then present, competent to\r\nhold it; and at the Peace of Utrecht, 1711, it was formally ceded\r\n“absolutely, with all manner of right for ever, without exemption or\r\nimpediment,” to Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards departed from the fortress they had valiantly defended, the\r\nmajority remaining at St. Roque. “Like some of the Moors whom they had\r\ndispossessed, their descendants are said to preserve until this day the\r\nrecords and family documents which form the bases of claims upon property\r\non that Rock, which, for more than a century and a half, has known other\r\nmasters.”\r\n\r\nRooke went absolutely unrewarded. He was persistently ignored by the\r\nGovernment of the day, and being a man of moderate fortune, consulted his\r\nown dignity, and retired to his country seat. The same year, 1704, the\r\nSpanish again attempted, with the aid of France, to take Gibraltar.\r\nEngland had only three months to strengthen and repair the fortifications,\r\nand the force brought against the Rock was by no means contemptible,\r\nincluding as it did a fleet of two-and-twenty French men-of-war. Succour\r\narrived; Sir John Leake succeeded in driving four of the enemy’s ships\r\nashore. An attempt to escalade the fortress was made, under the guidance\r\nof a native goat-herd. He, with a company of men, succeeded in reaching\r\nthe signal station, where a hard fight occurred, and our troops killed or\r\ndisabled 160 men, and took the remnant prisoners. Two sallies were made\r\nfrom the Rock with great effect, while an attempt made by the enemy to\r\nenter through a narrow breach resulted in a sacrifice of 200 lives. A\r\nFrench fleet, under Pointé, arrived; the English admiral captured three\r\nand destroyed one of them—that of Pointé himself. To make a six months’\r\nstory short, the assailants lost 10,000 men, and then had to raise the\r\nsiege. Although on several occasions our rulers have since the Peace of\r\nUtrecht proposed to cede or exchange the fortress, the spirit of the\r\npeople would not permit it; and there can be no doubt whatever that our\r\nright to Gibraltar is not merely that of possession—nine points of the\r\nlaw—but cession wrung from a people unable to hold it. And that, in war,\r\nis fair.\r\n\r\nTwenty years later Spain again attempted to wring it from us. Mr.\r\nStanhope, then our representative at Madrid, was told by Queen Isabella:\r\n“Either relinquish Gibraltar or your trade with the Indies.” We still hold\r\nGibraltar, and our trade with the Indies is generally regarded as a\r\ntolerably good one. In December, 1726, peace or war was made the\r\nalternative regarding the cession; another bombardment followed. An\r\nofficer(77) present said that it was so severe that “we seemed to live in\r\nflames.” Negotiations for peace followed at no great distance of time, and\r\nthe Spaniards suddenly drew off from the attack. Various offers, never\r\nconsummated, were made for an exchange. Pitt proposed to cede it in\r\nexchange for Minorca, Spain to assist in recovering it from the French. At\r\nanother time, Oran, a third-class port on the Mediterranean shores of\r\nAfrica, was offered in exchange; and Mr. Fitzherbert, our diplomatist, was\r\ntold that the King of Spain was “determined never to put a period to the\r\npresent war” if we did not agree to the terms; and again, that Oran “ought\r\nto be accepted with gratitude.” The tone of Spain altered very\r\nconsiderably a short time afterwards, when the news arrived of the\r\ndestruction of the floating batteries, and the failure of the grand\r\nattack.(78) This was at the last—the great siege of history. A few\r\nadditional details may be permitted before we pass to other subjects.\r\n\r\nThe actual siege occupied three years and seven months, and for one year\r\nand nine months the bombardment went on without cessation. The actual\r\nlosses on the part of the enemy can hardly be estimated; 1,473 were\r\nkilled, wounded, or missing on the floating batteries alone. But for brave\r\nCurtis, who took a pinnace to the rescue of the poor wretches on the\r\nbatteries, then in flames, and the ammunition of which was exploding every\r\nminute, more than 350 fresh victims must have gone to their last account.\r\nHis boat was engulfed amid the falling ruins; a large piece of timber fell\r\nthrough its flooring, killing the coxswain and wounding others. The\r\nsailors stuffed their jackets into the leak, and succeeded in saving the\r\nlives of 357 of their late enemies. For many days consecutively they had\r\nbeen peppering us at the rate of 6,500 shots, and over 2,000 shells each\r\ntwenty-four hours. With the destruction of the floating batteries “the\r\nsiege was virtually concluded. The contest was at an end, and the united\r\nstrength of two ambitious and powerful nations had been humbled by a\r\nstraitened garrison of 6,000 effective men.”(79) Our losses were\r\ncomparatively small, though thrice the troops were on the verge of famine.\r\nAt the period of the great siege the Rock mounted only 100 guns; now it\r\nhas 1,000, many of them of great calibre. In France, victory for the\r\nallies was regarded as such a foregone conclusion that “a drama,\r\nillustrative of the destruction of Gibraltar by the floating batteries,\r\nwas acted nightly to applauding thousands!”(80) The siege has, we believe,\r\nbeen a favourite subject at the minor English theatres many a time since;\r\nbut it need not be stated that the views taken of the result were widely\r\ndifferent to those popular at that time in Paris.\r\n\r\nGibraltar has had an eventful history even since the great siege. In 1804\r\na terrible epidemic swept the Rock; 5,733 out of a population of 15,000\r\ndied in a few weeks. The climate is warm and pleasant, but it is not\r\nconsidered the most healthy of localities even now. And on the 28th of\r\nOctober, 1805, the _Victory_, in tow of the _Neptune_, entered the bay,\r\nwith the body of Nelson on board. The fatal shot had done its work; only\r\neleven days before he had written to General Fox one of his happy,\r\npleasant letters.\r\n\r\nThe Rock itself is a compact limestone, a form of grey dense marble varied\r\nby beds of red sandstone. It abounds in caves and fissures, and advantage\r\nhas been taken of these facts to bore galleries, the most celebrated of\r\nwhich are St. Michael’s and Martin’s, the former 1,100 feet above the sea.\r\nTradition makes it a barren rock; but the botanists tell us differently.\r\nThere are 456 species of indigenous flowering plants, besides many which\r\nhave been introduced. The advantages of its natural position have been\r\neverywhere utilised. It bristles with batteries, many of which can hardly\r\nbe seen. Captain Sayer tells us that every spot where a gun could be\r\nbrought to bear on an enemy has one. “Wandering,” says he, “through the\r\ngeranium-edged paths on the hill-side, or clambering up the rugged cliffs\r\nto the eastward, one stumbles unexpectedly upon a gun of the heaviest\r\nmetal lodged in a secluded nook, with its ammunition, round shot,\r\ncanister, and case piled around it, ready at any instant.... The shrubs\r\nand flowers that grow on the cultivated places, and are preserved from\r\ninjury with so much solicitude, are often but the masks of guns, which lie\r\ncrouched beneath the leaves ready for the port-fire.” Everywhere, all\r\nstands ready for defence. War and peace are strangely mingled.\r\n\r\nGibraltar has one of the finest colonial libraries in the world, founded\r\nby the celebrated Colonel Drinkwater, whose account of the great siege is\r\nstill the standard authority. The town possesses some advantages; but as\r\n15,000 souls out of a population of about double that number are crowded\r\ninto one square mile, it is not altogether a healthy place—albeit much\r\nimproved of late years. Rents are exorbitant; but ordinary living and bad\r\nliquors are cheap. It is by no means the best place in the world for “Jack\r\nashore,” for, as Shakespeare tells us, “sailors” are “but men,” and there\r\nbe “land rats and water rats,” who live on their weaknesses. The town has\r\na very mongrel population, of all shades of colour and character. Alas!\r\nthe monkeys, who were the first inhabitants of the Rock—tailless Barbary\r\napes—are now becoming scarce. Many a poor Jocko has fallen from the\r\nenemy’s shot, killed in battles which he, at least, never provoked.\r\n\r\nThe scenery of the Straits, which we are now about to enter, is fresh and\r\npleasant, and as we commenced with an extract from one well-known poet, we\r\nmay be allowed to finish with that of another, which, if more hackneyed,\r\nis still expressive and beautiful. Byron’s well-known lines will recur to\r\nmany of our readers:—\r\n\r\n  “Through Calpe’s Straits survey the steepy shore;\r\n  Europe and Afric on each other gaze!\r\n  Lands of the dark-eyed maid and dusky Moor\r\n  Alike beheld beneath pale Hecate’s blaze;\r\n  How softly on the Spanish shore she plays,\r\n  Disclosing rock, and slope, and forest brown,\r\n  Distinct though darkening with her waning phase.”\r\n\r\nIn the distance gleams Mons Abyla—the Apes’ Hill of sailors—a term which\r\ncould have been, for a very long time, as appropriately given to\r\nGibraltar. It is the other sentinel of the Straits; while Ceuta, the\r\nstrong fortress built on its flanks, is held by Spain on Moorish soil,\r\njust as we hold the Rock of Rocks on theirs. Its name is probably a\r\ncorruption of _Septem_—Seven—from the number of hills on which it is\r\nbuilt. It is to-day a military prison, there usually being here two or\r\nthree thousand convicts, while both convicts and fortress are guarded by a\r\nstrong garrison of 3,500 soldiers. These in their turn were, only a few\r\nyears ago, guarded by the jealous Moors, who shot both guards and\r\nprisoners if they dared to emerge in the neighbourhood. There is, besides,\r\na town, as at Gibraltar, with over 15,000 inhabitants, and at the present\r\nday holiday excursions are commonly made across the Straits in strong\r\nlittle steamers or other craft. The tide runs into the Straits from the\r\nAtlantic at the rate of four or more knots per hour, and yet all this\r\nwater, with that of the innumerable streams and rivers which fall into the\r\nMediterranean, scarcely suffice to raise a perceptible tide! What becomes\r\nof all this water? Is there a hole in the earth through which it runs off?\r\nHardly: evaporation is probably the true secret of its disappearance: and\r\nthat this is the reason is proved by the greater saltness of the\r\nMediterranean as compared with the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nIn sailor’s parlance, “going aloft” has a number of meanings. He climbs\r\nthe slippery shrouds to “go aloft;” and when at last, like poor Tom\r\nBowling, he lies a “sheer hulk,” and—\r\n\r\n  “His body’s under hatches,\r\n  His soul has ‘_gone aloft_.’”\r\n\r\n“Going-aloft” in the Mediterranean has a very different meaning: it\r\nsignifies passing upwards and eastwards from the Straits of Gibraltar.(81)\r\nWe are now going aloft to Malta, a British possession hardly second to\r\nthat of the famed Rock itself.\r\n\r\n                          [Illustration: MALTA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ROUND THE WORLD ON A MAN-OF-WAR (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MALTA AND THE SUEZ CANAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n       Calypso’s Isle—A Convict Paradise—Malta, the “Flower of the\r\n    World”—The Knights of St. John—Rise of the Order—The Crescent and\r\n      the Cross—The Siege of Rhodes—L’Isle Adam in London—The Great\r\n       Siege of Malta—Horrible Episodes—Malta in French and English\r\n    Hands—St. Paul’s Cave—The Catacombs—Modern Incidents—The Shipwreck\r\n     of St. Paul—Gales in the Mediterranean—Experiences of Nelson and\r\n          Collingwood—Squalls in the Bay of San Francisco—A Man\r\n    Overboard—Special Winds of the Mediterranean—The Suez Canal and M.\r\n        de Lesseps—His Diplomatic Career—Saïd Pacha as a Boy—As a\r\n     Viceroy—The Plan Settled—Financial Troubles—Construction of the\r\n    Canal—The Inauguration Fête—Suez—Passage of the Children of Israel\r\n                           through the Red Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nApproaching Malta, we must “not in silence pass Calypso’s Isle.” Warburton\r\ndescribes it, in his delightful work on the East(82)—a classic on the\r\nMediterranean—as a little paradise, with all the beauties of a continent\r\nin miniature; little mountains with craggy summits, little valleys with\r\ncascades and rivers, lawny meadows and dark woods, trim gardens and\r\ntangled vineyards—all within a circuit of five or six miles.\r\n\r\nOne or two uninhabited little islands, “that seem to have strayed from the\r\ncontinent and lost their way,” dot the sea between the pleasant penal\r\nsettlement and Gozo, which is also a claimant for the doubtful honour of\r\nCalypso’s Isle. Narrow straits separate it from the rock, the “inhabited\r\nquarry,” called Malta, of which Valetta is the port. The capital is a\r\ncross between a Spanish and an Eastern town; most of its streets are\r\nflights of steps.\r\n\r\nAlthough the climate is delightful, it is extremely warm, and there is\r\nusually a glare of heat about the place, owing to its rocky nature and\r\nlimited amount of tree-shade. “All Malta,” writes Tallack,(83) “seems to\r\nbe light yellow—light yellow rocks, light yellow fortifications, light\r\nyellow stone walls, light yellow flat-topped houses, light yellow palaces,\r\nlight yellow roads and streets.” Stones and stone walls are the chief and\r\nconspicuous objects in a Maltese landscape; and for good reason, for the\r\nvery limited soil is propped up and kept in bounds by them on the hills.\r\nWith the scanty depth of earth the vegetation between the said stone walls\r\nis wonderful. The green bushy carob and prickly cactus are to be seen; but\r\nin the immediate neighbourhood of Malta few trees, only an occasional and\r\nsolitary palm. Over all, the bright blue sky; around, the deep blue sea.\r\nYou must not say anything to a Maltese against it; with him it is “Flor\r\ndel Mondo”—the “Flower of the World.”\r\n\r\nThe poorest natives live in capital stone houses, many of them with\r\nfaçades and fronts which would be considered ornamental in an English\r\ntown. The terraced roofs make up to its cooped inhabitants the space lost\r\nby building. There are five or six hundred promenadable roofs in the city.\r\nTallack says that the island generally is the abode of industry and\r\ncontentment. Expenses are high, except as regards the purchase of fruits,\r\nincluding the famed “blood,” “Mandolin” (sometimes called quite as\r\ncorrectly “Mandarin”) oranges, and Japan medlars, and Marsala wine from\r\nSicily. The natives live simply, as a rule, but the officers and foreign\r\nresidents commonly do not; and it is true here, as Ford says of the\r\nmilitary gentlemen at Gibraltar, that their faces often look somewhat\r\nredder than their jackets in consequence. As in India, many unwisely adopt\r\nthe high living of their class, in a climate where a cool and temperate\r\ndiet is indispensable.\r\n\r\nThe four great characteristics of Malta are soldiers, priests, goats, and\r\nbells—the latter not being confined to the necks of the goats, but\r\njangling at all hours from the many church towers. The goats pervade\r\neverywhere; there is scarcely any cow’s milk to be obtained in Malta. They\r\nmay often be seen with sheep, as in the patriarchal days of yore,\r\nfollowing their owners, in accordance with the pastoral allusions of the\r\nBible.\r\n\r\nWhat nature commenced in Valetta, art has finished. It has a land-locked\r\nharbour—really several, running into each other—surrounded by high\r\nfortified walls, above which rise houses, and other fortifications above\r\nthem. There are galleries in the rock following the Gibraltar precedent,\r\nand batteries bristling with guns; barracks, magazines, large docks,\r\nfoundry, lathe-rooms, and a bakery for the use of the “United” Service.\r\n\r\nTo every visitor the gorgeous church of San Giovanni, with its vaulted\r\nroof of gilded arabesque, its crimson hangings, and carved pulpits, is a\r\ngreat object of interest. Its floor resembles one grand escutcheon—a\r\nmosaic of knightly tombs, recalling days when Malta was a harbour of\r\nsaintly refuge and princely hospitality for crusaders and pilgrims of the\r\ncross. An inner chapel is guarded by massive silver rails, saved from the\r\nFrench by the cunning of a priest, who, on their approach, painted them\r\nwood-colour, and their real nature was never suspected. But amid all the\r\nsplendour of the venerable pile, its proudest possession to-day is a bunch\r\nof old rusty keys—the keys of Rhodes, the keys of the Knights of St. John.\r\nWhat history is not locked up with those keys! There is hardly a country\r\nin Europe, Asia, or Northern Africa, the history of which has not been\r\nmore or less entangled with that of these Knights of the Cross, who,\r\ndriven by the conquering Crescent from Jerusalem, took refuge successively\r\nin Cyprus, Rhodes, Candia, Messina, and finally, Malta.\r\n\r\nThe island had an important place in history and commerce long ere that\r\nperiod. The Phœnicians held it 700 years; the Greeks a century and a half.\r\nThe Romans retained it for as long a period as the Phœnicians; and after\r\nbeing ravaged by Goths and Vandals, it was for three and a half centuries\r\nan appanage of the crown of Byzantium. Next came the Arabs, who were\r\nsucceeded by the Normans, and soon after it had become a German\r\npossession, Charles V. presented it to the homeless knights.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the eleventh century, some merchants of the then\r\nflourishing commercial city of Amalfi obtained permission to erect three\r\nhostelries or hospitals in the Holy City, for the relief of poor and\r\ninvalided pilgrims. On the taking of Jerusalem by the Crusaders, the\r\nposition and prospects of the hospitals of St. John became greatly\r\nimproved. The organisation became a recognised religious order, vowing\r\npoverty, obedience, and chastity. Its members were distinguished by a\r\nwhite cross of four double points worn on a black robe, of the form\r\ncommonly to be met in the Maltese filigree jewellery of to-day, often to\r\nbe noted in our West End and other shops. Branch hospitals spread all over\r\nEurope with the same admirable objects, and the order received constant\r\nacquisitions of property. Under the guidance of Raymond du Puy, military\r\nservice was added to the other vows, and the monks became the White Cross\r\nKnights.(84) Henceforth each seat of the order became a military garrison\r\nin addition to a hospice, and each knight held himself in readiness to aid\r\nwith his arms his distressed brethren against the infidel.\r\n\r\nSlowly but surely the Crescent overshadowed the Cross: the Holy City had\r\nto be evacuated. The pious knights, after wandering first to Cyprus,\r\nsettled quietly in Rhodes, where for two centuries they maintained a\r\nsturdy resistance against the Turks. At the first siege, in 1480, a\r\nhandful of the former resisted 70,000 of the latter. The bombardment was\r\nso terrific that it is stated to have been heard a hundred miles off, and\r\nfor this extraordinary defence, Peter d’Aubusson, Grand Master, was made a\r\ncardinal by the Pope. At the second siege, L’Isle Adam, with 600 Knights\r\nof St. John, and 4,500 troops, resisted and long repelled a force of\r\n200,000 infidels. But the odds were too great against him, and after a\r\nbrave but hopeless defence, which won admiration even from the enemy,\r\nL’Isle Adam capitulated. After personal visits to the Pope, and to the\r\nCourts of Madrid, Paris, and London, the then almost valueless Rock of\r\nMalta was bestowed on the knights in 1530. Its noble harbours, and deep\r\nand sheltered inlets were then as now, but there was only one little town,\r\ncalled Burgo—Valetta as yet was not.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DEFENCE OF MALTA BY THE KNIGHTS OF ST. JOHN AGAINST THE\r\n                             TURKS IN 1565.]\r\n\r\nIn London, L’Isle Adam lodged at the provincial hostelry of the order, St.\r\nJohn’s Clerkenwell, still a house of entertainment, though of a very\r\ndifferent kind. Henry VIII. received him with apparent cordiality, and\r\nshortly afterwards confiscated all the English possessions of the knights!\r\nThis was but a trifle among their troubles, for in 1565 they were again\r\nbesieged in Malta. Their military knowledge, and especially that of their\r\nleader, the great La Valette, had enabled them to already strongly fortify\r\nthe place. La Valette had 500 knights and 9,000 soldiers, while the Turks\r\nhad 30,000 fighting men, conveyed thither in 200 galleys, and were\r\nafterwards reinforced by the Algerine corsair, Drugot, and his men. A\r\ndesperate resistance was made: 2,000 Turks were killed in a single day.\r\nThe latter took the fortress of St. Elmo, with the loss of Drugot—just\r\nbefore the terror of the Mediterranean—who was killed by a splinter of\r\nrock, knocked off by a cannon-ball in its flight. The garrison was at\r\nlength reduced to sixty men, who attended their devotions in the chapel\r\nfor the last time. Many of these were fearfully wounded, but even then the\r\nold spirit asserted itself, and they desired to be carried to the ramparts\r\nin chairs to lay down their lives in obedience to the vows of their order.\r\nNext day few of that devoted sixty were alive, a very small number\r\nescaping by swimming. The attempts on the other forts, St. Michael and St.\r\nAngelo, were foiled. Into the Eastern Harbour (now the Grand), Mustapha\r\nordered the dead bodies of the Christian knights and soldiers to be cast.\r\nThey were spread out on boards in the form of a cross, and floated by the\r\ntide across to the besieged with La Valette, where they were sorrowfully\r\ntaken up and interred. In exasperated retaliation, La Valette fired the\r\nheads of the Turkish slain back at their former companions—a horrible\r\nepisode of a fearful struggle. St. Elmo alone cost the lives of 8,000\r\nTurks, 150 Knights of St. John, and 1,300 of their men. After many false\r\npromises of assistance, and months of terrible suspense and suffering, an\r\nauxiliary force arrived from Sicily, and the Turks retired. Out of the\r\n9,500 soldiers and knights who were originally with La Valette, only 500\r\nwere alive at the termination of the great siege.\r\n\r\nThis memorable defence was the last of the special exploits of the White\r\nCross Knights, and they rested on their laurels, the order becoming\r\nwealthy, luxurious, and not a little demoralised. When the French\r\nRevolution broke out in 1789, the confiscation of their property in France\r\nnaturally followed; for they had been helping Louis XVI. with their\r\nrevenues just previously. Nine years later, Napoleon managed, by skilful\r\nintrigues, to obtain quiet possession of Malta. But he could not keep it,\r\nfor after two years of blockade it was won by Great Britain, and she has\r\nheld it ever since. At the Congress of Vienna in 1814, our possession was\r\nformally ratified. We hold it on as good a title as we do Gibraltar, by\r\nrights acknowledged at the signing of the Peace Treaty.(85)\r\n\r\nThe supposed scene of St. Paul’s shipwreck is constantly visited, and\r\nalthough some have doubted whether the Melita of St. Luke is not the\r\nisland of the same name in the Adriatic, tradition and probability point\r\nto Malta.(86) At St. Paul’s Bay, there is a small chapel over the cave,\r\nwith a statue of the apostle in marble, with the viper in his hand.\r\nColonel Shaw tells us that the priest who shows the cave recommended him\r\nto take a piece of the stone as a specific against shipwreck, saying,\r\n“Take away as much as you please, you will not diminish the cave.” Some of\r\nthe priests aver that there is a miraculous renovation, and that it cannot\r\ndiminish! and when they tell you that under one of the Maltese churches\r\nthe great apostle did _penance_ in a cell for three months, it looks still\r\nmore as though they are drawing on their imagination.\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: CATACOMBS AT CITTA VECCHIA, MALTA.]\r\n\r\nThe great catacombs at Citta Vecchia, Malta, were constructed by the\r\nnatives as places of refuge from the Turks. They consist of whole streets,\r\nwith houses and sleeping-places. They were later used for tombs. There are\r\nother remains on the island of much greater antiquity, _Hagiar Chem_ (the\r\nstones of veneration) date from Phœnician days. These include a temple\r\nresembling Stonehenge, on a smaller scale, where there are seven\r\nstatuettes with a grotesque rotundity of outline, the seven Phœnician\r\n_Cabiri_ (deities; “great and powerful ones”). There are also seven\r\ndivisions to the temple, which is mentioned by Herodotus and other ancient\r\nwriters.\r\n\r\nTo come back to our own time. In 1808, the following remarkable event\r\noccurred at Malta. One Froberg had raised a levy of Greeks for the British\r\nGovernment, by telling the individual members that they should all be\r\ncorporals, generals, or what not. It was to be all officers, like some\r\nother regiments of which we have heard. The men soon found out the deceit,\r\nbut drilled admirably until the brutality of the adjutant caused them to\r\nmutiny. Malta was at the time thinly garrisoned, and their particular fort\r\nhad only one small detachment of troops and thirty artillerymen. The\r\nmutineers made the officer of artillery point his guns on the town. He,\r\nhowever, managed that the shots should fall harmlessly. Another officer\r\nescaped up a chimney, and the Greeks coming into the same house, nearly\r\nsuffocated him by lighting a large fire below. Troops arrived; the\r\nmutineers were secured, and a court-martial condemned thirty, half of whom\r\nwere to be hanged, and the rest shot. Only five could be hanged at a time:\r\nthe first five were therefore suspended by the five who came next, and so\r\non. Of the men who were to be shot one ran away, and got over a parapet,\r\nwhere he was afterwards shot: another is thought to have escaped.\r\n\r\nColonel Shaw tells the story of a soldier of the Sicilian regiment who had\r\nfrequently deserted. He was condemned to be shot. A priest who visited him\r\nin prison left behind him—purposely, there can be little doubt—his iron\r\ncrucifix. The soldier used it to scrape away the mortar, and moved stone\r\nafter stone, until he got into an adjoining cell, where he found himself\r\nno better off, as it was locked. The same process was repeated, until he\r\nat last reached a cell of which the door was open, entered the passage and\r\nclimbed a wall, beneath which a sentry was posted. Fortunately for the\r\nprisoner, a regular Maltese shower was pouring down, and the guard\r\nremained in his box. The fugitive next reached a high gate, where it\r\nseemed he must be foiled. Not at all! He went back, got his blanket, cut\r\nit into strips, made a rope, and by its means climbed the gate, dropped\r\ninto a fosse, from which he reached and swam across the harbour. He lived\r\nconcealed for some time among the natives, but venturing one day into the\r\ntown, was recognised and captured. The governor considered that after all\r\nthis he deserved his life, and changed his sentence to transportation.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Malta, which, with its docks, navy-yard, and splendid\r\nharbours, fortifications, batteries, and magazines, is such an important\r\nnaval and military station, we may briefly mention the revenue derived,\r\nand expenditure incurred by the Government in connection with it, as both\r\nare considerable. The revenue derived from imposts of the usual nature,\r\nharbour dues, &c., is about £175,000. The military expenditure is about\r\n£366,000, which includes the expenses connected with the detachments of\r\nartillery, and the Royal Maltese Fencibles, a native regiment of 600 to\r\n700 men. The expenses of the Royal Navy would, of course, be incurred\r\nsomewhere, if not in Malta, and have therefore nothing to do with the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nOur next points of destination are Alexandria and Suez, both intimately\r\nidentified with British interests. On our way we shall be passing through\r\nor near the same waters as did St. Paul when in the custody of the\r\ncenturion Julius, “one of Augustus’ band.” It was in “a ship of\r\nAlexandria” that he was a passenger on that disastrous voyage. At Fair\r\nHavens, Crete (or Candia), we know that the Apostle admonished them to\r\nstay, for “sailing was now dangerous,” but his advice was disregarded, and\r\n“when the south wind blew softly” the master and owner of the vessel\r\nfeared nothing, but\r\n\r\n  “The flattering wind that late with promis’d aid,\r\n  From Candia’s Bay th’ unwilling ship betray’d,\r\n  No longer fawns beneath the fair disguise,”\r\n\r\nand “not long after, there arose against it a tempestuous wind called\r\nEuroclydon,” before which the ship drave under bare poles. We know that\r\nshe had to be undergirded; cables being passed under her hull to keep her\r\nfrom parting; and lightened, by throwing the freight overboard. For\r\nfourteen days the ship was driven hither and thither, till at length she\r\nwas wrecked off Melita. Sudden gales, whirlwinds, and typhoons are not\r\nuncommon in the Mediterranean; albeit soft winds and calm seas alternate\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd May, 1798, Nelson, while in the Gulf of Genoa, was assailed by\r\na sudden storm, which carried away all the _Vanguard’s_ topmasts, washed\r\none man overboard, killed an unfortunate middy and a seaman on board, and\r\nwounded others. This ship, which acted her name at the Nile only two\r\nmonths afterwards, rolled and laboured so dreadfully, and was in such\r\ndistress, that Nelson himself declared, “The meanest frigate out of France\r\nwould have been an unwelcome guest!” An officer relates that in the middle\r\nof the Gulf of Lyons, Lord Collingwood’s vessel, the _Ocean_, a roomy\r\n98-gun ship, was struck by a sea in the middle of a gale, that threw her\r\non her beam-ends, so much so that the men on the _Royal Sovereign_ called\r\nout, “The admiral’s gone down!” She righted again, however, but was\r\nterribly disabled. Lord Collingwood said afterwards that the heavy guns\r\nwere suspended almost _vertically_, and that “he thought the topsides were\r\nactually parting from the lower frame of the ship.” Admiral Smyth, in his\r\nimportant physical, hydrographical, and nautical work on the\r\nMediterranean, relates that in 1812, when on the _Rodney_, a new 74-gun\r\nship, she was so torn by the united violence of wind and wave, that the\r\nadmiral had to send her to England, although sadly in need of ships. He\r\nadds, however, that noble as was her appearance on the waters, “she was\r\none of that hastily-built batch of men-of-war sarcastically termed the\r\n_Forty Thieves_!”\r\n\r\nMany are the varieties of winds accompanied by special characteristics met\r\nin the Mediterranean, and, indeed, sudden squalls are common enough in all\r\nusually calm waters. The writer well remembers such an incident in the\r\nbeautiful Bay of San Francisco, California. He had, with friends, started\r\nin the morning from the gay city of “Frisco” on a deep-sea fishing\r\nexcursion. The vessel was what is technically known as a “plunger,” a\r\nstrongly-built two-masted boat, with deck and cabins, used in the bay and\r\ncoast trade of the North Pacific, or for fishing purposes. When the party,\r\nconsisting of five ladies, four gentlemen, the master and two men, started\r\nin the morning, there was scarcely a breath of wind or a ripple on the\r\nwater, and oars as large as those used on a barge were employed to propel\r\nthe vessel.\r\n\r\n  “The sea was bright, and the bark rode well,”\r\n\r\nand at length the desired haven, a sheltered nook, with fine cliffs,\r\nseaweed-covered rocks, and deep, clear water, was reached, and a dozen\r\nstrong lines, with heavy sinkers, put out. The sea was bountiful: in a\r\ncouple of hours enough fish were caught to furnish a capital lunch for\r\nall. A camp was formed on the beach, a large fire of driftwood lighted,\r\nand sundry hampers unpacked, from which the necks of bottles had protruded\r\nsuspiciously. It was an _al fresco_ picnic by the seaside. The sky was\r\nblue, the weather was delightful, “and all went merry as a marriage bell.”\r\nLater, while some wandered to a distance and bathed and swam, others\r\nclambered over the hills, among the flowers and waving wild oats for which\r\nthe country is celebrated. Then, as evening drew on, preparations were\r\nmade for a return to the city, and “All aboard” was the signal, for the\r\nwind was freshening. All remained on deck, for there was an abundance of\r\novercoats and rugs, and shortly the passing schooners and yachts could\r\nhear the strains of minstrelsy from a not altogether incompetent choir,\r\nseveral of the ladies on board being musically inclined. The sea gives\r\nrise to thoughts of the sea. The reader may be sure that “The Bay of\r\nBiscay,” “The Larboard Watch,” “The Minute Gun,” and “What are the Wild\r\nWaves saying?” came among a score of others. Meantime, the wind kept\r\nfreshening, but all of the number being well accustomed to the sea, heeded\r\nit not. Suddenly, in the midst of one of the gayest songs, a squall struck\r\nthe vessel, and as she was carrying all sail, put her nearly on her\r\nbeam-ends. So violent was the shock, that most things movable on deck,\r\nincluding the passengers, were thrown or slid to the lower side, many\r\nboxes and baskets going overboard. These would have been trifles, but\r\nalas, there is something sadder to relate. As one of the men was helping\r\nto take in sail, a great sea dashed over the vessel and threw him\r\noverboard, and for a few seconds only, his stalwart form was seen\r\nstruggling in the waves. Ropes were thrown to, or rather towards him, an\r\nempty barrel and a coop pitched overboard, but it was hopeless—\r\n\r\n  “That cry is ‘Help!’ where no help can come,\r\n  For the White Squall rides on the surging wave,”\r\n\r\nand he disappeared in an “ocean grave,” amid the mingled foam and driving\r\nspray. No more songs then; all gaiety was quenched, and many a tear-drop\r\nclouded eyes so bright before. The vessel, under one small sail only (the\r\njib), drove on, and in half an hour broke out of obscurity and mist, and\r\nwas off the wharfs and lights of San Francisco in calm water. The same\r\ndistance had occupied over four hours in the morning.\r\n\r\nIn the Mediterranean every wind has its special name. There is the\r\nsearching north wind, the _Grippe_ or _Mistral_, said to be one of the\r\nscourges of gay Provence—\r\n\r\n  “La Cour de Parlement, le Mistral et la Durance,\r\n  Sont les trois fléaux de la Provence.”\r\n\r\nThe north blast, a sudden wind, is called _Boras_, and hundreds of sailors\r\nhave practically prayed, with the song,\r\n\r\n  “Cease, rude Boreas.”\r\n\r\nThe north-east biting wind is the _Gregale_, while the south-east, often a\r\nviolent wind, is the dreaded _Sirocco_, bad either on sea or shore. The\r\nlast which need be mentioned here, is the stifling south-west wind, the\r\n_Siffante_. But now we have reached the Suez Canal.\r\n\r\n                       [Illustration: M. LESSEPS.]\r\n\r\nThis gigantic work, so successfully completed by M. Lesseps, for ever\r\nsolved the _possibility_ of a work which up to that time had been so\r\nemphatically declared to be an impossibility. In effect, he _is_ a\r\nconqueror. “_Impossible_,” said the first Napoleon, “_n’est pas\r\nFrançais_,” and the motto is a good one for any man or any nation,\r\nalthough the author of the sentence found many things impossible,\r\nincluding that of which we speak. M. de Lesseps has done more for peace\r\nthan ever the Disturber of Europe did with war.\r\n\r\nWhen M. de Lesseps(87) commenced with, not the Canal, but the grand\r\nconception thereof, he had pursued twenty-nine years of first-class\r\ndiplomatic service: it would have been an honourable career for most\r\npeople. He gave it up from punctilios of honour; lost, at least possibly,\r\nthe opportunity of great political power. He was required to endorse that\r\nwhich he could not possibly endorse. Lesseps had lost his chance, said\r\nmany. Let us see. The man who has conquered the usually unconquerable\r\nEnglish prejudice would certainly surmount most troubles! He has _only_\r\ncarried out the ideas of Sesostris, Alexander, Cæsar, Amrou, the Arabian\r\nconqueror, Napoleon the Great, and Mehemet Ali. These are simply matters\r\nof history. But history, in this case, has only repeated itself in the\r\nfailures, not in the successes. Lesseps has made the success; _they_ were\r\nthe failures! Let us review history, amid which you may possibly find many\r\ntruths. The truth alone, as far as it may be reached, appears in this\r\nwork. The Peace Society ought to endorse Lesseps. As it stands, the Peace\r\nparty—well-intentioned people—ought to raise a statue to the man who has\r\nmade it almost impossible for England to be involved in war, so far as the\r\ngreat East is concerned, for many a century to come.\r\n\r\nAfter all, who is the conqueror—he who kills, or he who saves, thousands?\r\n\r\nTo prove our points, it will not be necessary to recite the full history\r\nof the grandest engineering work of this century—a century replete with\r\nproud engineering works. Here it can only be given in the barest outline.\r\n\r\nEvery intelligent child on looking at the map would ask why the natural\r\nroute to India was not by the Isthmus of Suez, and why a canal was not\r\nmade. His schoolmaster answered, in days gone by, that there was a\r\ndifference in the levels of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. That\r\nquestion has been answered successfully, and the difference has not ruined\r\nthe Canal. Others said that it was impossible to dig a canal through the\r\ndesert. It has been done! Lord Palmerston, the most serious opponent in\r\nEngland that Lesseps had,(88) thought that France, our best ally to-day,\r\nwould have too much influence in Egypt. Events, thanks to Lord\r\nBeaconsfield’s astute policy, by purchasing the Khedive’s interest, have\r\ngiven England the largest share among the shareholders of all nations.\r\n\r\nIt would not be interesting to follow all the troubles that Lesseps\r\nsuccessfully combated. The idea had more than once occurred to him, when\r\nin 1852 he applied to Constantinople. The answer was that it in no way\r\nconcerned the Porte. Lesseps returned to his farm at Berry, and not\r\nunlikely constructed miniature Suez Canals for irrigation, thought of\r\ncamels while he improved the breed of cattle, and built houses, but not on\r\nthe sand of the desert. Indeed, it was while on the roof of one of his\r\nhouses, then in course of construction, that the news came to him of the\r\nthen Pacha of Egypt’s death (Mehemet Ali). They had once been on familiar\r\nterms. Mehemet Ali was a terribly severe man, and seeing that his son Saïd\r\nPacha, a son he loved, was growing fat, he had sent him to climb the masts\r\nof ships for two hours a day, to row, and walk round the walls of the\r\ncity. Poor little fat boy! he used to steal round to Lesseps’ rooms, and\r\nsurreptitiously obtain meals from the servants. Those surreptitious\r\ndinners did not greatly hurt the interests of the Canal, as we shall see.\r\n\r\nMehemet Ali had been a moderate tyrant—to speak advisedly. His son-in-law,\r\nDefderdar, known popularly as the “Scourge of God,” was his acting\r\nvicegerent. The brute once had his groom shod like a horse for having\r\nbadly shod his charger. A woman of the country one day came before him,\r\ncomplaining of a soldier who had bought milk of her, and had refused to\r\npay for it. “Art thou sure of it?” asked the tyrant. “Take care! they\r\nshall tear open thy stomach if no milk is found in that of the soldier.”\r\nThey opened the stomach of the soldier. Milk was found in it. The poor\r\nwoman was saved. But, although his successor was not everything that could\r\nbe wished, he had a good heart, and was not “the terrible Turk.”\r\n\r\nIn 1854, Lesseps met Saïd Pacha in his tent on a plain between Alexandria\r\nand Lake Mareotis, a swamp in the desert. His Highness was in good humour,\r\nand understood Lesseps perfectly. A fine Arabian horse had been presented\r\nto him by Saïd Pacha a few days previously. After examining the plans and\r\ninvestigating the subject, the ruler of Egypt said, “I accept your plan.\r\nWe will talk about the means of its execution during the rest of the\r\njourney. Consider the matter settled. You may rely on me.” He sent\r\nimmediately for his generals, and made them sit down, repeating the\r\nprevious conversation, and inviting them to give their opinion of the\r\nproposals of his _friend_. The impromptu counsellors were better able to\r\npronounce on equestrian evolutions than on a vast enterprise. But Lesseps,\r\na good horseman, had just before cleared a wall with his charger, and\r\nthey, seeing how he stood with the Viceroy, gave their assent by raising\r\ntheir hands to their foreheads. The dinner-tray then appeared, and with\r\none accord all plunged their spoons into the same bowl, which contained\r\nsome first-class soup. Lesseps considered it, very naturally, as the most\r\nimportant negotiation he had ever made.\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: BIRD’S-EYE VIEW OF SUEZ CANAL.]\r\n\r\nResults speak for themselves. In 1854, there _was not a fly in that\r\nhideous desert_. Water, sheep, fowls, and provisions of all kinds had to\r\nbe carried by the explorers. When at night they opened the coops of fowls,\r\nand let the sheep run loose, they did it with confidence. They were sure\r\nthat next morning, in that desolate place, the animals dare not desert the\r\nparty. “When,” says Lesseps, “we struck our camp of a morning, if at the\r\nmoment of departure a hen had lurked behind, pecking at the foot of a\r\ntamarisk shrub, quickly she would jump up on the back of a camel, to\r\nregain her cage.” That desert is now peopled. There are three important\r\ntowns. Port Saïd had not existed before: there is now what would be called\r\na “city,” in America, on a much smaller basis of truth: it has 12,000\r\npeople. Suez, with 15,000 people, was not much more than a village\r\npreviously. Ismaïlia, half-way on the route, has 5,000 or 6,000 of\r\npopulation. There are other towns or villages.\r\n\r\nA canal actually effecting a junction between the two seas _viâ_ the Nile\r\nwas made in the period of the Egyptian dynasties. It doubtless fulfilled\r\nits purpose for the passage of galleys and smaller vessels; history hardly\r\ntells us when it was rendered useless. Napoleon the First knew the\r\nimportance of the undertaking, and appointed a commission of engineers to\r\nreport on it. M. Lepère presented him a report on its feasibility, and\r\nNapoleon observed on it, “It is a grand work; and though I cannot execute\r\nit now, the day may come when the Turkish Government will glory in\r\naccomplishing it.” Other schemes, including those of eminent Turkish\r\nengineers, had been proposed. It remained to be accomplished in this\r\ncentury. The advantages gained by its construction can hardly be\r\nenumerated here. Suffice it to say that a vessel going by the Cape of Good\r\nHope from London to Bombay travels nearly 6,000 miles over the ocean; by\r\nthe Suez Canal the distance is 3,100, barely more than half the distance.\r\n\r\nTo tell the history of the financial troubles which obstructed the scheme\r\nwould be tedious to the reader. At last there was an International\r\nCommission appointed, which cost the Viceroy of Egypt £12,000, and yet no\r\nsingle member took a farthing for his services. The names are sufficient\r\nto prove with what care it had been selected. On the part of England,\r\nMessrs. Rendel and MacClean, both eminent engineers, with, for a\r\nsufficiently good reason, Commander Hewet of the East India Company’s\r\nservice, who for twenty-seven years had been making surveys in the Red Sea\r\nand Indian Ocean. France gave two of her greatest engineers, Messrs.\r\nRenaud and Liessou: Austria, one of _the_ greatest practical engineers in\r\nthe world, M. de Negrelli; Italy, M. Paléocapa; Germany, the distinguished\r\nPrivy Councillor Lentzé; Holland, the Chevalier Conrad; Spain, M. de\r\nMontesino. They reported entirely in favour of the route. A second\r\nInternational Congress followed. The Viceroy behaved so magnificently to\r\nthe scientific gentlemen of all nations who composed the commission, that\r\nM. de Lesseps thanked him publicly for having received them almost as\r\ncrowned heads. The Viceroy answered gracefully, “Are they not the crowned\r\nheads of science?”\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: MAP OF THE SUEZ CANAL.]\r\n\r\nAt last the financial and political difficulties were overcome. In 1858,\r\nan office was opened in Paris, into which money flowed freely. Lesseps\r\ntells good-naturedly some little episodes which occurred. An old\r\nbald-headed priest entered, doubtless a man who had been formerly a\r\nsoldier. “Oh! those English,” said he, “I am glad to be able to be\r\nrevenged on them by taking shares in the Suez Canal.” Another said, “I\r\nwish to subscribe for ‘Le Chemin de Fer de l’Ile de Suède’” (The Island of\r\nSweden Railway!) It was remarked to him that the scheme did not include a\r\nrailway, and that Sweden is not an island. “That’s all the same to me,” he\r\nreplied, “provided it be against the English, I subscribe.” Lord\r\nPalmerston, whose shade must feel uneasy in the neighbourhood of the\r\nCanal, could not have been more prejudiced. At Grenoble, a whole regiment\r\nof engineers—naturally men of intelligence and technical knowledge,\r\nclubbed together for shares. The matter was not settled by even the free\r\ninflow of money. The Viceroy had been so much annoyed by the opposition\r\nshown to the scheme, that it took a good deal of tact on the part of its\r\npromoter to make things run smoothly. For the first four years, Lesseps,\r\nin making the necessary international and financial arrangements,\r\ntravelled 30,000 miles per annum.\r\n\r\nAt length the scheme emerged from fog to fact. The Viceroy had promised\r\n20,000 Egyptian labourers, but in 1861 he begged to be let out of his\r\nengagement. He had to pay handsomely for the privilege. Although the men\r\nwere paid higher than they had ever been before, their labour was cheap:\r\nit cost double or treble the amount to employ foreigners.\r\n\r\nThe Canal, in its course of a shade over 100 miles, passes through several\r\nsalt marshes, “Les Petits Bassins des Lacs Amers,” in one of which a\r\ndeposit of salt was found, seven miles long by five miles wide. It also\r\npasses through an extensive piece of water, Lake Menzaleh.\r\n\r\nAt Lake Menzaleh the banks are very slightly above the level of the Canal,\r\nand from the deck of a big steamer there is an unbounded view over a wide\r\nexpanse of lake and morass studded with islets, and at times gay and\r\nbrilliant with innumerable flocks of rosy pelicans, scarlet flamingoes,\r\nand snow-white spoonbills, geese, ducks, and other birds. The pelicans may\r\nbe caught bodily from a boat, so clumsy are they in the water, without the\r\nexpenditure of powder and shot. Indeed, the sportsman might do worse than\r\nvisit the Canal, where, it is almost needless to state, the shooting is\r\nopen to all. A traveller, who has recently passed through the Canal _en\r\nroute_ to India, writes that there are alligators also to be seen. The\r\nwhole of the channel through Lake Menzaleh was almost entirely excavated\r\nwith dredges. When it was necessary to remove some surface soil before\r\nthere was water enough for the dredges to float, it was done by the\r\nnatives of Lake Menzaleh, a hardy and peculiar race, quite at home in\r\ndigging canals or building embankments. The following account shows their\r\nmode of proceeding:—“They place themselves in files across the channel.\r\nThe men in the middle of the file have their feet and the lower part of\r\ntheir legs in the water. These men lean forward and take in their arms\r\nlarge clods of earth, which they have previously dug up below the water\r\nwith a species of pickaxe called a fass, somewhat resembling a short, big\r\nhoe. The clods are passed from man to man to the bank, where other men\r\nstand with their backs turned, and their arms crossed behind them, so as\r\nto make a sort of primitive hod. As soon as each of these has had enough\r\nclods piled on his back, he walks off, bent almost double, to the further\r\nside of the bank, and there opening his arms, lets his load fall through\r\nto the ground. It is unnecessary to add that this original _métier_\r\nrequires the absence of all clothing.”(89)\r\n\r\nInto the channel thus dug the dredges were floated. One of the machines\r\nemployed deserves special mention. The _long couloir_ (duct) was an iron\r\nspout 230 feet long, five and a half wide, and two deep, by means of which\r\na dredger working in the centre of the channel could discharge its\r\ncontents beyond the bank, assisted by the water which was pumped into it.\r\nThe work done by these long-spouted dredges has amounted to as much as\r\n120,000 cubic yards a-piece of soil in a month. By all kinds of ingenious\r\nappliances invented for the special needs of the occasion, as much as\r\n2,763,000 cubic yards of excavation were accomplished in a month. M. de\r\nLesseps tells us that “were it placed in the Place Vendôme, it would fill\r\nthe whole square, and rise five times higher than the surrounding houses.”\r\nIt would cover the entire length and breadth of the Champs Elysées, and\r\nreach to the top of the trees on either side.\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: THE SUEZ CANAL: DREDGES AT WORK.]\r\n\r\nPort Saïd, which owes its very existence to the Canal, is to-day a port of\r\nconsiderable importance, where some of the finest steamships in the world\r\nstop. All the through steamers between Europe and the East—our own grand\r\n“P. & O.” (Peninsular and Oriental) line, the splendid French\r\n“Messageries,” the Austrian Lloyd’s, and dozens of excellent lines, all\r\nmake a stay here of eight or ten hours. This is long enough for most\r\ntravellers, as, sooth to say, the very land on which it is built had to be\r\n“made,” in other words, it was a tract of swampy desert. It has\r\nrespectable streets and squares, docks, quays, churches, mosques, and\r\nhotels. The outer port is formed by two enormous breakwaters, one of which\r\nruns straight out to sea for a distance of 2,726 yards. They have\r\nlighthouses upon them, using electricity as a means of illumination.\r\nMessrs. Borel and Lavalley were the principal contractors for the work.\r\nThe ingenious machinery used cost nearly _two and a half million pounds_\r\n(actually £2,400,000), and the _monthly_ consumption of coal cost the\r\nCompany £40,000.\r\n\r\nThe distance from Port Saïd to Suez is 100 miles. The width of the Canal,\r\nwhere the banks are low, is about 328 feet, and in deep cuttings 190 feet.\r\nThe deep channel is marked with buoys. The mole at the Port Saïd\r\n(Mediterranean) end of the Canal stretches out into the sea for over half\r\na mile, near the Damietta branch of the Nile. This helps to form an\r\nartificial harbour, and checks the mud deposits which might otherwise\r\nchoke the entrance. It cost as much as half a million. In the Canal there\r\nare recesses—shall we call them sidings, as on a railway?—where vessels\r\ncan enter and allow others to pass.\r\n\r\nThe scenery, we must confess, is generally monotonous. At Ismaïlia,\r\nhowever, a town has arisen where there are charming gardens. We are told\r\nthat “it seems only necessary to pour the waters of the Nile on the desert\r\nto produce a soil which will grow anything to perfection.” Here the\r\nViceroy built a temporary palace, and M. de Lesseps himself has a\r\n_châlet_. At Suez itself the scenery is charming. From the height, on\r\nwhich is placed another of the Khedive’s residences, there is a\r\nmagnificent panorama in view. In the foreground is the town, harbour,\r\nroadstead, and mouth of the Canal. To the right are the mountain\r\nheights—Gebel Attákah—which hem in the Red Sea. To the left are the rosy\r\npeaks of Mount Sinai, so familiar to all Biblical students as the spot\r\nwhere the great Jewish Law was given by God to Moses; and between the two,\r\nthe deep, deep blue of the Gulf. Near Suez are the so-called “Wells of\r\nMoses,” natural springs of rather brackish water, surrounded by tamarisks\r\nand date-palms, which help to form an oasis—a pic-nic ground—in the\r\ndesert. Dean Stanley has termed the spot “the Richmond of Suez.”\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the Canal on our outward voyage, it will not be out of\r\nplace to note the inauguration _fête_, which must have been to M. de\r\nLesseps the proudest day of a useful life. Two weeks before that event,\r\nthe engineers were for the moment baffled by a temporary obstruction—a\r\nmass of solid rock in the channel. “Go,” said the unconquerable projector,\r\n“and get powder at Cairo—powder in quantities; and then, if we can’t blow\r\nup the rock, we’ll blow up ourselves.” That rock was very soon in\r\nfragments! The spirit and _bonhomie_ of Lesseps made everything easy, and\r\nthe greatest difficulties surmountable. “From the beginning of the work,”\r\nsays he, “there was not a tent-keeper who did not consider himself an\r\nagent of civilisation.” This, no doubt, was the great secret of his grand\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: OPENING OF THE SUEZ CANAL—PROCESSION OF SHIPS.]\r\n\r\nThe great day arrived. On the 16th of November, 1868, there were 160\r\nvessels ready to pass the Canal. At the last moment that evening it was\r\nannounced that an Egyptian frigate had run on one of the banks of the\r\nCanal, and was hopelessly stuck there, obstructing the passage. She could\r\nnot be towed off, and the united efforts of several hundred men on the\r\nbank could not at first move her. The Viceroy even proposed to blow her\r\nup. It was only five minutes before arriving at the site of the accident\r\nthat an Egyptian admiral signalled to Lesseps from a little steam-launch\r\nthat the Canal was free. A procession of 130 vessels was formed, the steam\r\nyacht _L’Aigle_, _en avant_, carrying on board the Empress of the French,\r\nthe Emperor of Austria, and the Viceroy. This noble-hearted Empress, who\r\nhas been so long exiled in a country she has learned to love, told Lesseps\r\nat Ismaïlia that during the whole journey she had felt “as though a circle\r\nof fire were round her head,” fearing that some disaster might mar the\r\nday’s proceedings. Her pent-up feelings gave way at last; and when success\r\nwas assured, she retired to her cabin, where sobs were heard by her\r\ndevoted friends—sobs which did great honour to her true and patriotic\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThe Viceroy on that occasion entertained 6,000 foreigners, a large\r\nproportion of whom were of the most distinguished kind. Men of all\r\nnationalities came to honour an enlightened ruler, and witness the opening\r\nof a grand engineering work, which had been carried through so many\r\nopposing difficulties; to applaud the man of cool head and active brain,\r\nwho had a few years before been by many jeered at, snubbed, and thwarted.\r\nTo suitably entertain the vast assemblage, the Viceroy had engaged 500\r\ncooks and 1,000 servants, bringing many of them from Marseilles, Trieste,\r\nGenoa, and Leghorn.\r\n\r\nAlthough the waters of the Canal are usually placid—almost sleepily\r\ncalm—they are occasionally lashed up into waves by sudden storms. One\r\nsuch, which did some damage, occurred on December 9th, 1877.\r\n\r\nAnd now, before leaving the subject, it will be right to mention a few\r\nfacts of importance. The tonnage of vessels passing the Canal quadrupled\r\nin five years. As many as thirty-three vessels have been passing in one\r\nday at the same time, although this was exceptional. In 1874, the relative\r\nproportions, as regards the nationalities of tonnage, if the expression\r\nmay be permitted, were as follows:—\r\n\r\nEnglish    222,000   tons.\r\nFrench     103,000   „\r\nDutch       84,000   „\r\nAustrian    63,000   „\r\nItalian     50,000   „\r\nSpanish     39,000   „\r\nGerman      28,000   „\r\nVarious     65,000   „\r\n\r\nThe present tonnage passing the Canal is much greater. All the world knows\r\nhow and why England acquired her present interest in the Canal, but all\r\nthe world does not appreciate its value to the full extent.\r\n\r\nSuez has special claims to the attention of the Biblical student, for near\r\nit—according to some, eighteen miles south of it—the children of Israel\r\npassed through the Red Sea; 2,000,000 men, women, and children, with\r\nflocks of cattle went dryshod through the dividing walls of water. Holy\r\nWrit informs us that “the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east\r\nwind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were\r\ndivided.”(90) The effect of wind, in both raising large masses of water\r\nand in driving them back, is well known, while there are narrow parts of\r\nthe Red Sea which have been forded. In the morning “the Egyptians pursued,\r\nand went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh’s horses,\r\nhis chariots, and his horsemen.” We know the sequel. The waters returned,\r\nand covered the Egyptian hosts; “there remained not so much as one of\r\nthem.” “Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the\r\nLord, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed\r\ngloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown in the sea. * * *\r\n\r\n“Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen\r\ncaptains also are drowned in the Red Sea.\r\n\r\n“The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.”\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: CATCHING PELICANS ON LAKE MENZALEH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ROUND THE WORLD ON A MAN-OF-WAR (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE INDIA AND CHINA STATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Red Sea and its Name—Its Ports—On to the India Station—Bombay:\r\n      Island, City, Presidency—Calcutta—Ceylon, a Paradise—The China\r\n    Station—Hong Kong—Macao—Canton—Capture of Commissioner Yeh—The Sea\r\n    of Soup—Shanghai—“Jack” Ashore there—Luxuries in Market—Drawbacks:\r\n          Earthquakes, and Sand Showers—Chinese Explanations of\r\n          Earthquakes—The Roving Life of the Sailor—Compensating\r\n          Advantages—Japan and its People—The Englishmen of the\r\n     Pacific—Yokohama—Peculiarities of the Japanese—Off to the North.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Red Sea separates Arabia from Egypt, Nubia, and Abyssinia. Its name is\r\neither derived from the animalculæ which sometimes cover parts of its\r\nsurface, or, more probably, from the red and purple coral which abound in\r\nits waters. The Hebrew name signifies “the Weedy Sea,” because the corals\r\nhave often plant-like forms. There are reefs of coral in the Red Sea which\r\nutterly prevent approach to certain parts of the coasts. Many of the\r\nislands which border it are of volcanic origin. On the Zeigar Islands\r\nthere was an alarming eruption in 1846. England owns one of the most\r\nimportant of the islands, that of Perim, in the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb.\r\nIt is a barren, black rock, but possesses a fine harbour, and commands one\r\nentrance of the Red Sea. It was occupied by Great Britain in 1799,\r\nabandoned in 1801, and re-occupied on the 11th of February, 1857. Its\r\nfortifications possess guns of sufficient calibre and power to command the\r\nStraits.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: JIDDAH, FROM THE SEA.]\r\n\r\nThe entire circuit of the Red Sea is walled by grand mountain ranges. Some\r\nof its ports and harbours are most important places. There is Mocha, so\r\ndear to the coffee-drinker; Jiddah, the port for the holy city of Mecca,\r\nwhither innumerable pilgrims repair; Hodeida, and Locheia. It was in\r\nJiddah that, in 1858, the Moslem population rose against the Christians,\r\nand killed forty-five, including the English and French consuls. On the\r\nAfrican side, besides Suez, there are the ports of Cosseir, Suakim, and\r\nMassuah. The Red Sea is deep for a partially inland sea; there is a\r\nrecorded instance of soundings to 1,000 fathoms—considerably over a\r\nmile—and no bottom found.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Red Sea, where shall we proceed? We have the choice of\r\nthe India, China, or Australia Stations. Actually, to do the voyage\r\nsystematically, Bombay would be the next point.\r\n\r\nBombay, in general terms, is three things: a city of three-quarters of a\r\nmillion souls; a presidency of 12,000,000 inhabitants; or an island—the\r\nisland of Mambai, according to the natives, or Buon Bahia, the “good\r\nhaven,” if we take the Portuguese version. The city is built on the\r\nisland, which is not less than eight miles long by three broad, but the\r\npresidency extends to the mainland.\r\n\r\nIn 1509, the Portuguese visited it, and in 1530 it became theirs. In 1661,\r\nit was blindly ceded to our Charles II., as simply a part of the dowry of\r\nhis bride, the Infanta Catherine. Seven years after Charles the Dissolute\r\nhad obtained what is now the most valuable colonial possession of Great\r\nBritain, he ceded it to the Honourable East India Company—though, of\r\ncourse, for a handsome consideration.\r\n\r\nBombay has many advantages for the sailor. It is always accessible during\r\nthe terrible south-west monsoons, and possesses an anchoring ground of\r\nfifty miles, sheltered by islands and a magnificent series of breakwaters,\r\nat the south end of which is a grand lighthouse. Its docks and dockyards\r\ncover fifty acres; ship-building is carried on extensively; and there is\r\nan immense trade in cotton, coffee, opium, spices, gums, ivory, and\r\nshawls. Of its 700,000 inhabitants, 50,000 are\r\nParsees—Persians—descendants of the original Fire-worshippers. A large\r\nproportion of them are merchants. It may not be generally known to our\r\nreaders that the late Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy—who left wealth untold,\r\nalthough all his days he had been a humane and charitable man, and who\r\nestablished in Bombay alone two fine hospitals—was a Parsee.\r\n\r\nCalcutta, in 1700, was but a collection of petty villages, surrounding the\r\nfactories or posts of the East India Company, and which were presented to\r\nthat corporation by the Emperor of Delhi. They were fortified, and\r\nreceived the name of Fort William, in honour of the reigning king. It\r\nsubsequently received the title of Calcutta, that being the name of one of\r\nthe aforesaid villages. Seven years after that date, Calcutta was attacked\r\nsuddenly by Surajah Dowlah, Nawab of Bengal. Abandoned by many who should\r\nhave defended it, 146 English fell into the enemy’s hands, who put them\r\ninto that confined and loathsome cell of which we have all read, the\r\n“Black Hole of Calcutta.” Next morning but twenty-three of the number were\r\nfound alive. Lord Clive, eight months later, succeeded in recapturing\r\nCalcutta, and after the subsequently famous battle of Plassey, the\r\npossessions of the East India Company greatly extended. To-day Calcutta\r\nhas a “Strand” longer than that of London, and the batteries of Fort\r\nWilliam, which, with their outworks, cover an area half a mile in\r\ndiameter, and have cost £2,000,000, form the strongest fortress in India.\r\n\r\nAcross the continent by railway, and we land easily in Calcutta. It has,\r\nwith its suburbs, a larger population than Bombay, but can never rival it\r\nas a port, because it is a hundred miles up the Hooghly River, and\r\nnavigation is risky, although ships of 2,000 tons can reach it. It derives\r\nits name from Kali Ghatta, the ghaut or landing-place of the goddess Kali.\r\nTerrible cyclones have often devastated it; that in 1867 destroyed 30,000\r\nnative houses, and a very large amount of human life.\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: CYCLONE AT CALCUTTA.]\r\n\r\nThe sailor’s route would, however, take him, if bound to China or\r\nAustralia, round the island of Ceylon, in which there are two harbours,\r\nPoint de Galle, used as a stopping-place, a kind of “junction” for the\r\ngreat steamship lines, of which the splendid Peninsular and Oriental (the\r\n“P. & O.”) Company, is the principal. Point de Galle is the most\r\nconvenient point, but it does not possess a first-class harbour. At\r\nTrincomalee, however, there is a magnificent harbour.\r\n\r\nCeylon is one of the most interesting islands in the world. It is the\r\nSerendib of the “Arabian Nights,” rich in glorious scenery, equable\r\nclimate, tropical vegetation, unknown quantities of gems and pearls, and\r\nmany minerals. The sapphire, ruby, topaz, garnet, and amethyst abound. A\r\nsapphire was found in 1853 worth £4,000. Its coffee plantations are a\r\nsource of great wealth. Palms, flowering shrubs, tree ferns,\r\nrhododendrons, as big as timber trees, clothe the island in perennial\r\nverdure. The elephant, wild boar, leopard, bear, buffalo, humped ox, deer,\r\npalm-cat and civet are common, but there are few dangerous or venomous\r\nanimals. The Singhalese population, really Hindoo colonists, are\r\neffeminate and cowardly. The Kandyans, Ceylonese Highlanders, who dwell in\r\nthe mountains, are a more creditable race, sturdy and manly. Then there\r\nare the Malabars, early Portuguese and Dutch settlers, with a sprinkling\r\nof all nationalities.\r\n\r\nThere, too, are the outcast Veddahs, the real wild men of the woods. With\r\nthem there is no God—no worship. The Rock Veddahs live in the jungle,\r\nfollow the chase, sleep in caves or in the woods, eat lizards, and\r\nconsider roast monkey a prime dish. The Village Veddahs are a shade more\r\ncivilised.\r\n\r\nOne reads constantly in the daily journals of the India, China, or\r\nAustralian Stations, and the reader may think that they are very\r\nintelligible titles. He may be surprised to learn that the East India\r\nStation not merely includes the ports of India and Ceylon, but the whole\r\nIndian Ocean, as far south as Madagascar, and the east coast of Africa,\r\nincluding Zanzibar and Mozambique, where there are dockyards. The China\r\nStation includes Japan, Borneo, Sumatra, the Philippine Islands, and the\r\ncoast of Kamchatka and Eastern Siberia to Bering Sea. The Australian\r\nStation includes New Zealand and New Guinea. The leading stations in China\r\nare Hong Kong, Canton, and Shanghai. Vessels bound to the port of Canton\r\nhave to enter the delta of the Pearl River, the area of which is largely\r\noccupied with isles and sandbanks. There are some thirty forts on the\r\nbanks. When the ship has passed the mouth of this embouchure, which forms,\r\nin general terms, a kind of triangle, the sides of which are 100 miles\r\neach in length, you can proceed either to the island of Hong Kong, an\r\nEnglish colony, or to the old Portuguese settlement of Macao.\r\n\r\nThe name Hong Kong is a corruption of Hiang Kiang,(91) which is by\r\ninterpretation “Scented Stream.” Properly, the designation belongs to a\r\nsmall stream on the southern side of the island, where ships’ boats have\r\nlong been in the habit of obtaining fine pure water; but now the name is\r\ngiven by foreigners to the whole island. The island is about nine miles in\r\nlength, and has a very rugged and barren surface, consisting of rocky\r\nranges of hills and mountains, intersected by ravines, through which\r\nstreams of the purest water flow unceasingly. Victoria, Hong Kong, is the\r\ncapital of the colony, and the seat of government. It extends for more\r\nthan three miles east and west, part of the central grounds being occupied\r\nby military barracks and hospitals, commissariat buildings, colonial\r\nchurches, post-office, and harbour-master’s depôt, all of which are\r\noverlooked by the Government-house itself, high up on the hill. Close to\r\nthe sea-beach are the commercial houses, clubs, exchange, and\r\nmarket-places.\r\n\r\nIt was the shelter, security, and convenience offered by the harbour that\r\ninduced our Government to select it for a British settlement; it has one\r\nof the noblest roadsteads in the world. Before the cession to England in\r\n1841, the native population on the island did not exceed 2,000; now there\r\nare 70,000 or 80,000.\r\n\r\nMacao (pronounced _Macow_) is forty miles to the westward of Hong Kong,\r\nand an agreeable place as regards its scenery and surroundings, but\r\ndeficient as regards its harbour accommodation. Dr. Milne, himself a\r\nmissionary resident for fourteen years in China, says, writing in 1859:\r\n“To some of the present generation of English residents in China, there\r\ncan be anything but associations of a comfortable kind connected with\r\nMacao, recollecting as they must the unfriendly policy which the\r\nPortuguese on the spot pursued some sixteen or seventeen years since, and\r\nthe bitterly hostile bearing which the Chinese of the settlement were\r\nencouraged to assume towards the ‘red-haired English.’”\r\n\r\nMacao is a peninsula, eight miles in circuit, stretching out from a large\r\nisland. The connecting piece of land is a narrow isthmus, which in native\r\ntopography is called “the stalk of a water-lily.” In 1840 a low wall\r\nstretched across this isthmus, the foundation stones of which had been\r\nlaid about three hundred years ago, with the acknowledged object of\r\nlimiting the movements of foreigners. This was the notorious “barrier,”\r\nwhich, during the Chinese war of 1840-1, was used to annoy the English. As\r\nlarge numbers of the peasantry had to pass the “barrier gates” with\r\nprovisions for the mixed population at Macao, it was a frequent manœuvre\r\nwith the Chinese authorities to stop the market supplies by closing the\r\ngate, and setting over it a guard of half-starved and ravenous soldiery.\r\n\r\n                          [Illustration: MACAO.]\r\n\r\nLeaving Macao for Canton, the ship passes the celebrated “Bogue Forts,”\r\nthreads her course through a network of islets and mud-banks, and at last\r\ndrops anchor twelve miles from the city off the island of Whampoa, where\r\nthe numerous and grotesque junks, “egg boats,” “sampans,” &c., indicate a\r\nnear approach to an important place. The name Canton is a European\r\ncorruption of Kwang-tung, the “Broad East.” Among the Chinese it is\r\nsometimes described poetically as “the city of the genii,” “the city of\r\ngrain,” and the “city of rams.” The origin of these terms is thus shown in\r\na native legend. After the foundation of the city, which dates back 2,000\r\nyears, five genii, clothed in garments of five different colours, and\r\nriding on five rams of different colours, met on the site of Canton. Each\r\nof the rams bore in its mouth a stalk of grain having five ears, and\r\npresented them to the tenants of the soil, to whom they spake in these\r\nwords:—\r\n\r\n  “May famine and death never visit you!”\r\n\r\nUpon this the rams were immediately petrified into stone images. There is\r\na “Temple of the Five Rams” close to one of the gates of Canton.\r\n\r\nThe river scene at Canton is most interesting. It is a floating town of\r\nhuts built on rafts and on piles, with boats of every conceivable size,\r\nshape and use, lashed together. “It is,” says Dr. Milne, “an _aquarium_ of\r\nhuman occupants.” Canton has probably a population of over a million. The\r\nentire circuit of city and suburbs cannot be far from ten miles.\r\n\r\nCanton was bombarded in 1857-8 by an allied English and French force. Ten\r\ndays were given to the stubborn Chinese minister, Yeh, to accede to the\r\nterms dictated by the Allies, and every means was taken to inform the\r\nnative population of the real _casus belli_, and to advise them to remove\r\nfrom the scene of danger. Consul Parkes and Captain Hall were engaged\r\namong other colporteurs in the rather dangerous labour of distributing\r\ntracts and bills. In one of their rapid descents, Captain Hall caught a\r\nmandarin in his chair, not far from the city gate, and pasted him up in it\r\nwith bills, then starting off the bearers to carry this new advertising\r\nvan into the city! The Chinese crowd, always alive to a practical joke,\r\nroared with laughter. When the truce expired, more than 400 guns and\r\nmortars opened fire upon the city, great pains being taken only to injure\r\nthe city walls, official Chinese residences, and hill forts. Then a force\r\nof 3,000 men was landed, and the city was between two fires. The\r\nhill-forts were soon taken, and an expedition planned and executed,\r\nchiefly to capture the native officials of high rank. Mr. Consul Parkes,\r\nwith a party, burst into a _yamun_, an official residence, and in a few\r\nseconds Commissioner Yeh was in the hands of the English. An ambitious\r\n_aide-de-camp_ of Yeh’s staff protested strongly that the captive was the\r\nwrong man, loudly stammering out, “_Me_ Yeh! _Me_ Yeh!” But this attempted\r\ndeceit was of no avail; the prize was safely bagged, and shortly\r\nafterwards the terms of peace were arranged. The loss of life in the\r\nassault was not over 140 British and 30 French.\r\n\r\nShanghai is a port which has grown up almost entirely since 1844, the date\r\nof its first occupation by foreigners for purposes of commerce. Then there\r\nwere only forty-four foreign merchant ships, twenty-three foreign\r\nresidents and families, one consular flag, and two Protestant\r\nmissionaries. Twelve years later, there were, for six months’ returns, 249\r\nBritish ships, fifty-seven American, eleven Hamburg, eleven Dutch, nine\r\nSwedish, seven Danish, six Spanish, and seven Portuguese, besides those of\r\nother nationalities. The returns for the whole year embraced 434 ships of\r\nall countries; tea exports, 76,711,659 pounds; silk, 55,537 bales.\r\n\r\nShanghai (“the Upper Sea”) has been written variously Canhay, Changhay,\r\nXanghay, Zonghae, Shanhae, Shanghay, and so forth. Its proper\r\npronunciation is as if the final syllable were “high,” not “hay.”\r\n\r\n“Sailing towards the north of China,” says Milne, “keeping perhaps fifty\r\nor sixty miles off the coast, as the ship enters the thirtieth parallel, a\r\nstranger is startled some fine morning by coming on what looks like a\r\nshoal—perhaps a sand-bank, a reef—he knows not what. It is an expanse of\r\ncoloured water, stretching out as far as the eye can reach, east, north,\r\nand west, and entirely distinct from the deep-blue sea which hitherto the\r\nvessel had been ploughing. Of course, he finds that it is the ‘Yellow\r\nSea;’ a sea so yellow, turbid, and thick, certainly, that you might think\r\nall the pease-soup in creation, and a great deal more, had been emptied\r\ninto one monster cistern.” The name is therefore appropriate, as are the\r\ndesignations of several others:\r\n\r\n  “The Yellow Sea, the Sea that’s Red,\r\n  The White, the Black, the one that’s Dead.”\r\n\r\nBetween the thirtieth degree of north latitude, where the group of the\r\nChoosan Islands commences, and the thirty-seventh degree, this sea of\r\nsoup, this reservoir of tawny liquid, ranges, fed by three great rivers,\r\nthe Tseen-Tang, the Yangtsze-Kiang, and the Hwang-Ho, the greatest of\r\nwhich is the second, and which contributes the larger part of the muddy\r\nsolution held in its waters. Forty-five miles from the _embouchure_ of the\r\nYangtsze-Kiang, you reach the Woosung anchorage, and a few miles further\r\nthe city of Shanghai, where the tributary you have been following divides\r\ninto the Woosung and Whampoa branches, at the fork of which the land ceded\r\nto the British is situated. Here there is a splendid British consulate,\r\nchurches, mansions, and foreign mercantile houses.\r\n\r\nThe old city was built over three centuries ago, and is encircled, as\r\nindeed are nearly all large Chinese cities and towns, by a wall\r\ntwenty-four feet high and fifteen broad; it is nearly four miles in\r\ncircumference. Shanghai was at one time greatly exposed to the\r\ndepredations of freebooters and pirates, and partly in consequence of this\r\nthe wall is plentifully provided with loop-holes, arrow-towers, and\r\nmilitary observatories. The six great gates of the city of Shanghai have\r\ngrandiloquent titles, _à la Chinoise_. The north gate is the “calm-sea\r\ngate;” the great east gate is that for “paying obeisance to the honourable\r\nones;” the little east one is “the precious girdle gate;” the great south\r\nis the gate for “riding the dragon,” while another is termed “the pattern\r\nPhœnix.”\r\n\r\nIts oldest name is Hoo. In early days the following curious mode of\r\ncatching fish was adopted. Rows of bamboo stakes, joined by cords, were\r\ndriven into the mud of the stream, among which, at ebb tide, the fish\r\nbecame entangled, and were easily caught. This mode of fishing was called\r\n_hoo_, and as at one time Shanghai was famous for its fishing stakes, it\r\ngained the name of the “Hoo city.” The tides rise very rapidly in the\r\nriver, and sometimes give rise to alarming inundations. Lady Wortley’s\r\ndescription of the waters of the Mississippi apply to the river-water of\r\nShanghai; “it looks marvellously like an enormous running stream of\r\napothecary’s stuff, a very strong decoction of mahogany-coloured bark,\r\nwith a slight dash of port wine to deepen its hue; it is a\r\nmulatto-complexioned river, there is no doubt of that, and wears the\r\ndeep-tanned livery of the burnished sun.” Within and without the walls,\r\nthe city is cut up by ditches and moats, which, some years ago, instead of\r\nbeing sources of benefit and health to the inhabitants, as they were\r\noriginally intended to be, were really open sewers, breathing out effluvia\r\nand pestilence. In some respects, however, Shanghai is now better ordered\r\nas regards municipal arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of the earth are abundant at Shanghai, and “Jack ashore” may\r\nrevel in delicious peaches, figs, persimmons, cherries, plums, oranges,\r\ncitrons, and pomegranates, while there is a plentiful supply of fish,\r\nflesh, and fowl. Grains of all kinds, rice, and cotton are cultivated\r\nextensively; the latter gives employment at the loom for thousands. On the\r\nother hand there are drawbacks in the shape of clouds of musquitoes,\r\nflying-beetles, heavy rains, monsoons, and earthquakes. The prognostics of\r\nthe latter are a highly electric state of the atmosphere, long drought,\r\nexcessive heat, and what can only be described as a stagnation of all\r\nnature. Dr. Milne, reciting his experiences, says: “At the critical moment\r\nof the commotion, the earth began to rock, the beams and walls cracked\r\nlike the timbers of a ship under sail, and a nausea came over one, a\r\nsea-sickness really horrible. At times, for a second or two previous to\r\nthe vibration, there was heard a subterraneous growl, a noise as of a\r\nmighty rushing wind whirling about under ground.” The natives were\r\nterror-struck, more especially if the quake happened at night, and there\r\nwould burst a mass of confused sounds, “Kew ming! Kew ming!” (“Save your\r\nlives! save your lives!”) Dogs added their yells to the medley, amid the\r\nstriking of gongs and tomtoms. Next day there would be exhaustless gossip\r\nconcerning upheaval and sinking of land, flames issuing from the\r\nhill-sides, and ashes cast about the country. The Chinese ideas on the\r\nsubject are various. Some thought the earth had become too hot, and that\r\nit had to relieve itself by a shake, or that it was changing its place for\r\nanother part of the universe. Others said that the Supreme One, to bring\r\ntransgressors to their senses, thought to alarm them by a quivering of the\r\nearth. The notion most common among the lower classes is, that there are\r\nsix huge sea-monsters, great fish, which support the earth, and that if\r\nany one of these move, the earth must be agitated. Superstition is rife in\r\nascribing these earth-shakings chiefly to the remissness of the\r\npriesthood. In almost every temple there is a _muh-yu_—an image of a scaly\r\nwooden fish, suspended near the altar, and among the duties of the\r\npriests, it is rigidly prescribed that they keep up an everlasting tapping\r\non it. If they become lax in their duties, the fish wriggle and shake the\r\nearth to bring the drowsy priests to a sense of their duty.\r\n\r\nA singular meteorological phenomenon often occurs at Shanghai—_a fall of\r\ndust_, fine, light and impalpable, sometimes black, ordinarily yellow. The\r\nsun or moon will scarcely be visible through this sand shower. The deposit\r\nof this exquisite powder is sometimes to the extent of a quarter of an\r\ninch, after a fall of a day or two; it will penetrate the closest venetian\r\nblinds; it overspreads every article of furniture in the house; finds its\r\nway into the innermost chambers and recesses. In walking about, one’s\r\nclothes are covered with dust—the face gets grimy, the mouth and throat\r\nparched; the teeth grate; the eyes, ears, and nostrils become itchy and\r\nirritable. The fall sometimes extends as far as Ningpo in the\r\ninterior—also some 200 miles out at sea. Some think that it is blown all\r\nthe way from the steppes of Mongolia, after having been wafted by typhoons\r\ninto the upper regions of the air: others think that it comes across the\r\nseas from the Japanese volcanoes, which are constantly subject to\r\neruptions.\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: VESSELS IN THE PORT OF SHANGHAI.]\r\n\r\nThe population of Shanghai, rapidly increasing, is probably about 400,000\r\nto 450,000 souls. It swarms with professional beggars. Among the many\r\ncreditable things cited by Milne regarding the Chinese, is the number of\r\nnative charitable institutions in Canton, Ningpo, and Shanghai, including\r\nFoundling Hospitals, the (Shanghai) “Asylum for Outcast Children, retreats\r\nfor poor and destitute widows, shelters for the maimed and blind, medical\r\ndispensaries, leper hospitals, vaccine establishments, almshouses, free\r\nburial societies,” and so forth. So much for the heartless Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe sailor certainly has this compensation for his hard life, that he sees\r\nthe world, and visits strange countries and peoples by the dozen,\r\nprivileges for which many a man tied at home by the inevitable force of\r\ncircumstances would give up a great deal. What an oracle is he on his\r\nreturn, amid his own family circle or friends! How the youngsters in\r\nparticular hang on his every word, look up at his bronzed and honest face,\r\nand wish that they could be sailors,—\r\n\r\n  “Strange countries for to see.”\r\n\r\nHow many curiosities has he not to show—from the inevitable parrot,\r\nchattering in a foreign tongue, or swearing roundly in English vernacular,\r\nto the little ugly idol brought from India, but possibly manufactured in\r\nBirmingham!(92) If from China, he will probably have brought home some\r\ncurious caddy, fearfully and wonderfully inlaid with dragons and\r\nimpossible landscapes; an ivory pagoda, or, perhaps, one of those\r\nwonderfully-carved balls, with twenty or so more inside it, all separate\r\nand distinct, each succeeding one getting smaller and smaller. He may have\r\nwith him a native oil-painting; if a portrait, stolid and hard; but if of\r\na ship, true to the last rope, and exact in every particular. In San\r\nFrancisco, where there are 14,000 or more Chinese, may be seen native\r\npaintings of vessels which could hardly be excelled by a European artist,\r\nand the cost of which for large sizes, say 3½ by 2½ feet, was only about\r\nfifteen dollars (£3). What with fans, handkerchiefs, Chinese ladies’ shoes\r\nfor feet about three inches in length, lanterns, chopsticks, pipes,\r\nrice-paper drawings, books, neat and quaint little porcelain articles for\r\npresents at home, it will be odd if Jack, who has been mindful of the “old\r\nfolks at home,” and the young folks too, and the “girl he left behind\r\nhim,” does not become a very popular man.\r\n\r\nAnd then his yarns of Chinese life! How on his first landing at a port,\r\nthe natives in proffering their services hastened to assure him in “pigeon\r\nEnglish” (“pigeon” is a native corruption of “business,” as a mixed jargon\r\nhad and has to be used in trading with the lower classes) that “Me all\r\nsame Englische man; me belly good man;” or “You wantee washy? me washy\r\nyou?” which is simply an offer to do your laundry work;(93) or “You wantee\r\nglub (grub); me sabee (know) one shop all same Englische belly good.” Or,\r\nperhaps, he has met a Chinaman accompanying a coffin home, and yet looking\r\nquite happy and jovial. Not knowing that it is a common custom to present\r\ncoffins to relatives during lifetime, he inquires, “Who’s dead, John?” “No\r\nman hab die,” replies the Celestial, “no man hab die. Me makee my olo\r\nfader cumsha. Him likee too muchee, countoo my number one popa, s’pose he\r\ndie, can catchee,” which freely translated is—“No one is dead. It is a\r\npresent from me to my aged father, with which he will be much pleased. I\r\nesteem my father greatly, and it will be at his service when he dies.” How\r\none of the common names for a foreigner, especially an Englishman, is “I\r\nsay,” which derived its use simply from the Chinese hearing our sailors\r\nand soldiers frequently ejaculate the words when conversing, as for\r\nexample, “I say, Bill, there’s a queer-looking pigtail!” The Chinese took\r\nit for a generic name, and would use it among themselves in the most\r\ncurious way, as for example, “A red-coated _I say_ sent me to buy a fowl;”\r\nor “Did you see a tall _I say_ here a while ago?” The application is,\r\nhowever, not more curious than the title of “John” bestowed on the\r\nChinaman by most foreigners as a generic distinction. Less flattering\r\nepithets used to be freely bestowed on us, especially in the interior,\r\nsuch as “foreign devil,” “red-haired devil,” &c. The phrase Hungmaou,\r\n“red-haired,” is applied to foreigners of all classes, and arose when the\r\nDutch first opened up trade with China. A Chinese work, alluding to their\r\narrival, says, “Their raiment was red, and their hair too. They had bluish\r\neyes, deeply sunken in their head, and our people were quite frightened by\r\ntheir strange aspect.”\r\n\r\nJack will have to tell how many strange anomalies met his gaze. For\r\nexample, in launching their junks and vessels, they are sent into the\r\nwater _sideways_. The horseman mounts on the _right_ side. The scholar,\r\nreciting his lesson, _turns his back_ on his master. And if Jack, or, at\r\nall events one of his superior officers, goes to a party, he should not\r\nwear light pumps, but as thick solid shoes as he can get; _white lead_ is\r\nused for _blacking_. On visits of ceremony, you should keep your hat _on_;\r\nand when you advance to your host, you should close your fists and _shake\r\nhands with yourself_. Dinners commence with sweets and fruits, and _end_\r\nwith fish and soup. White is the funereal colour. You may see adults\r\ngravely flying kites, while the youngsters look on; shuttlecocks are\r\nbattledored by the _heel_. Books begin at the end; the paging is at the\r\nbottom, and in reading, you proceed from right to left. The surname\r\nprecedes the Christian name. The fond mother holds her babe to her nose to\r\nsmell it—as she would a rose—instead of kissing it.\r\n\r\nWhat yarns he will have to tell of pigtails! How the Chinese sailor lashes\r\nit round his cap at sea; how the crusty pedagogue, with no other rod of\r\ncorrection, will, on the spur of the moment, lash the refractory scholar\r\nwith it; and how, for fun, a wag will tie two or three of his companions’\r\ntails together, and start them off in different directions! But he will\r\nalso know from his own or others’ experiences that the foreigner must not\r\nattempt practical jokes upon John Chinaman’s tail. “_Noli me tangere_,”\r\nsays Dr. Milne, “is the order of the tail, as well as of the thistle.”\r\n\r\nNow that most of the restrictions surrounding foreigners in Japan have\r\nbeen removed, and that enlightened people—the Englishmen of the Pacific in\r\nenterprise and progress—have taken their proper place among the nations of\r\nthe earth, visits to Japan are commonly made by even ordinary tourists\r\nmaking the circuit of the globe, and we shall have to touch there again in\r\nanother “voyage round the world” shortly to follow. The English sailors of\r\nthe Royal Navy often have an opportunity of visiting the charming islands\r\nwhich constitute Japan. Its English name is a corruption of\r\n_Tih-punquo_—Chinese for “Kingdom of the Source of the Sun.” Marco Polo\r\nwas the first to bring to Europe intelligence of the bright isles, whose\r\nJapanese name, Nipon or Niphon, means literally “Sun-source.”\r\n\r\nOn the way to Yokohama, the great port of Japan, the voyager will\r\nencounter the monsoons, the north-east version of which brings deliciously\r\ncool air from October to March, while the south-west monsoon brings hot\r\nand weary weather. On the way Nagasaki, on the island of Kiusiu, will\r\nalmost certainly be visited, which has a harbour with a very narrow\r\nentrance, with hills running down to the water’s edge, beautifully covered\r\nwith luxuriant grass and low trees. The Japanese have planted batteries on\r\neither side, which would probably prevent any vessel short of a strong\r\nironclad from getting in or out of the harbour. The city has a population\r\nat least of 150,000. There are a number of Chinese restricted to one\r\nquarter, surrounded by a high wall, in which is a heavy gate, that is\r\nsecurely locked every night. Their dwellings are usually mean and filthy,\r\nand compare very unfavourably with the neat, clean, matted dwellings of\r\nthe Japanese. The latter despise the former; indeed, you can scarcely\r\ninsult a native more than to compare him with his brother of Nankin. The\r\nJapanese term them the Nankin Sans.\r\n\r\nThe island of Niphon, on which Yokohama is situated, is about one hundred\r\nand seventy miles long by seventy broad, while Yesso is somewhat longer\r\nand narrower. Japan really became known to Europe through Fernando Mendez\r\nPinto, a Portuguese who was shipwrecked there in 1549. Seven years later\r\nthe famous Jesuit, Francis Xavier, introduced the Catholic faith, which\r\nfor a long time made great progress. But a fatal mistake was made in 1580,\r\nwhen an embassy was sent to the Pope with presents and vows of allegiance.\r\nThe reigning Tycoon(94) had his eyes opened by this act, and saw that to\r\nprofess obedience to any spiritual lord was to weaken his own power\r\nimmeasurably. The priests of the old religions, too, complained bitterly\r\nof the loss of their flocks, and the Tycoon determined to crush out the\r\nChristian faith. Thousands upon thousands of converts were put to death,\r\nand the very last of them are said to have been hurled from the rock of\r\nPapenberg, at Nagasaki, into the sea. In 1600, William Adams, an English\r\nsailor on a Dutch ship, arrived in the harbour of Bungo, and speedily\r\nbecame a favourite with the Tycoon, who, through him, gave the English\r\npermission to establish a trading “factory” on the island of Firando. This\r\nwas later on abandoned, but the Dutch East India Company continued the\r\ntrade on the same island, under very severe restrictions. The fire-arms\r\nand powder on their ships were taken from them immediately on arrival, and\r\nonly returned when the ships were ready for sea again.\r\n\r\n                        [Illustration: YOKOHAMA.]\r\n\r\nYokohama, the principal port, stands on a flat piece of ground, at the\r\nwide end of a valley, which runs narrowing up for several miles in the\r\ncountry. The site was reclaimed from a mere swamp by the energy of the\r\nGovernment; and there is now a fine sea-wall facing the sea, with two\r\npiers running out into it, on each of which there is a custom-house. The\r\naverage Japanese in the streets is clothed in a long thin cotton robe,\r\nopen in front and gathered at the waist by a cloth girdle. This\r\nconstitutes the whole of his dress, save a scanty cloth tied tightly round\r\nthe loins, cotton socks and wooden clogs. The elder women look hideous,\r\nbut some of their ugliness is self-inflicted, as it is the fashion, when a\r\nwoman becomes a wife, to draw out the hair of her eyebrows and varnish her\r\nteeth black! Their teeth are white, and they still have their eyebrows,\r\nbut are too much prone to the use of chalk and vermilion on their cheeks.\r\nEvery one is familiar with the Japanese stature—under the general\r\naverage—for there are now a large number of the natives resident in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nJack will soon find out that the Japanese _cuisine_ is most varied. Tea\r\nand sacki, or rice beer, are the only liquors used, except, of course, by\r\ntravelled, Europeanised, or Americanised Japanese. They sit on the floor,\r\nsquatting on their heels in a manner which tires Europeans very rapidly,\r\nalthough they look as comfortable as possible. The floor serves them for\r\nchair, table, bed, and writing-desk. At meals there is a small stand,\r\nabout nine inches high, by seven inches square, placed before each\r\nindividual, and on this is deposited a small bowl, and a variety of little\r\ndishes. Chopsticks are used to convey the food to their mouths. Their most\r\ncommon dishes are fish boiled with onions, and a kind of small bean,\r\ndressed with oil; fowls stewed and cooked in all ways; boiled rice. Oil,\r\nmushrooms, carrots, and various bulbous roots, are greatly used in making\r\nup their dishes. In the way of a bed in summer, they merely lie down on\r\nthe mats, and put a _wooden_ pillow under their heads; but in winter\r\nindulge in warm quilts, and have brass pans of charcoal at the feet. They\r\nare very cleanly, baths being used constantly, and the public bath-houses\r\nbeing open to the street. Strangely enough, however, although so\r\nparticular in bodily cleanliness, they never wash their clothes, but wear\r\nthem till they almost drop to pieces. A gentleman who arrived there in\r\n1859, had to send his clothes to Shanghai to be washed—a journey of 1,600\r\nmiles! Since the great influx of foreigners, however, plenty of Niphons\r\nhave turned laundrymen.\r\n\r\nTheir tea-gardens, like those of the Chinese, are often large and\r\nextremely ornamental, and at them one obtains a cup of genuine tea made\r\nbefore your eyes for one-third of a halfpenny.(95)\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: THE FUSIYAMA MOUNTAIN.]\r\n\r\nThe great attraction, in a landscape point of view, outside Yokohama, is\r\nthe grand Fusiyama Mountain, an extinct volcano, the great object of\r\nreverence and pride in the Japanese heart, and which in native drawings\r\nand carvings is incessantly represented. A giant, 14,000 feet high, it\r\ntowers grandly to the clouds, snow-capped and streaked. It is deemed a\r\nholy and worthy deed to climb to its summit, and to pray in the numerous\r\ntemples that adorn its sides. Thousands of pilgrims visit it annually. And\r\nnow let us make a northward voyage.\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: A TEA MART IN JAPAN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ROUND THE WORLD ON A MAN-OF-WAR (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n             NORTHWARD AND SOUTHWARD—THE AUSTRALIAN STATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n       The Port of Peter and Paul—Wonderful Colouring of Kamchatka\r\n     Hills—Grand Volcanoes—The Fight at Petropaulovski—A Contrast—An\r\n    International Pic-nic—A Double Wedding—Bering’s Voyages—Kamchatka\r\n            worthy of Further Exploration—Plover Bay—Tchuktchi\r\n     Natives—Whaling—A Terrible Gale—A Novel “Smoke-stack”—Southward\r\n        again—The Liverpool of the East—Singapore, a Paradise—New\r\n     Harbour—Wharves and Shipping—Cruelties of the Coolie Trade—Junks\r\n          and Prahus—The Kling-gharry Drivers—The Durian and its\r\n     Devotees—Australia—Its Discovery—Botany Bay and the Convicts—The\r\n         First Gold—Port Jackson—Beauty of Sydney—Port Philip and\r\n                                Melbourne.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany English men-of-war have visited the interesting peninsula of\r\nKamchatka, all included in the China station. How well the writer\r\nremembers the first time he visited Petropaulovski, the port of Peter and\r\nPaul! Entering first one of the noblest bays in the whole world—glorious\r\nAvatcha Bay—and steaming a short distance, the entrance to a capital\r\nharbour disclosed itself. In half an hour the vessel was inside a\r\nlandlocked harbour, with a sand-spit protecting it from all fear of gales\r\nor sudden squalls. Behind was a highly-coloured little town, red roofs,\r\nyellow walls, and a church with burnished turrets. The hills around were\r\nautumnly frost-coloured; but not all the ideas the expression will convey\r\nto an artist could conjure up the reality. Indian yellow merging through\r\ntints of gamboge, yellow, and brown ochre to sombre brown; madder lake,\r\nbrown madder, Indian red to Roman sepia; greys, bright and dull greens\r\nindefinable, and utterly indescribable, formed a _mélange_ of colour which\r\ndefied description whether by brush or pen. It was delightful; but it was\r\npuzzling. King Frost had completed at night that which autumn had done by\r\nday. Then behind rose the grand mountain of Koriatski, one of a series of\r\ngreat volcanoes. It seemed a few miles off; it was, although the wonderful\r\nclearness of the atmosphere belied the fact, some thirty miles distant. An\r\nimpregnable fortress of rock, streaked and capped with snow, it defies\r\ntime and man. Its smoke was constantly observed; its pure snows only hid\r\nthe boiling, bubbling lava beneath.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few decent houses, the residences of the civil\r\ngovernor, captain of the port, and other officials, and a few foreign\r\nmerchants, the town makes no great show. The poorer dwellings are very\r\nrough, and, indeed, are almost exclusively log cabins. A very picturesque\r\nand noticeable building is the old Greek church, which has painted red and\r\ngreen roofs, and a belfry full of bells, large and small, detached from\r\nthe building, and only a foot or two raised above the ground. It is to be\r\nnoted that the town, as it existed in Captain Clerke’s time, was built on\r\nthe sand-spit. It was once a military post, but the Cossack soldiers have\r\nbeen removed to the Amoor.\r\n\r\nThere are two monuments of interest in Petropaulovski; one in honour of\r\nBering, the second to the memory of La Perouse. The former is a plain\r\ncast-iron column, railed in, while the latter is a most nondescript\r\nconstruction of sheet iron, and is of octagonal form. Neither of these\r\nnavigators is buried in the town. Poor Bering’s remains lie on the island\r\nwhere he miserably perished, and which now bears his name; while of the\r\nfate of La Perouse, and his unfortunate companions, little is known.\r\n\r\nIn 1855, Petropaulovski was visited by the allied fleets, during the\r\nperiod of our war with Russia. They found an empty town, for the Russian\r\nGovernment had given up all idea of defending it. The combined fleet\r\ncaptured one miserable whaler, razed the batteries, and destroyed some of\r\nthe government buildings. There were good and sufficient reasons why they\r\nshould have done nothing. The poor little town of Saints Peter and Paul\r\nwas beneath notice, as victory there could never be glorious. But a\r\nstronger reason existed in the fact, recorded in a dozen voyages, that\r\nfrom the days of Cook and Clerke to our own, it had always been famous for\r\nthe unlimited hospitality and assistance shown to explorers and voyagers,\r\nwithout regard to nationality. All is _not_ fair in war. Possibly,\r\nhowever, reason might be found for the havoc done, in the events of the\r\nprevious year.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1854, the inhabitants of Petropaulovski had covered themselves\r\nwith glory, much to their own surprise. On the 28th of the month, six\r\nEnglish and French vessels—the _President_, _Virago_, _Pique_, _La Fort_,\r\n_l’Eurydice_, and _l’Obligado_—entered Avatcha Bay. Admiral Price\r\nreconnoitred the harbour and town, and placed the _Virago_ in position at\r\n2,000 yards. The Russians had two vessels, the _Aurora_ and _Dwina_, to\r\ndefend the harbour, and a strong chain was placed across its narrow\r\nentrance. The town was defended by seven batteries and earthworks,\r\nmounting fifty guns.\r\n\r\nIt was not difficult to silence the batteries, and they were accordingly\r\nsilenced. The townspeople, with their limited knowledge of the\r\nEnglish—those English they had always so hospitably received, and who were\r\nnow doing their best to kill them—thought their hour was come, and that,\r\nif not immediately executed, they would have to languish exiles in a\r\nforeign land, far from their beautiful Kamchatka. The town was, and is,\r\ndefended almost as much by nature as by art. High hills shut it in so\r\ncompletely, and the harbour entrance can be so easily defended, that there\r\nis really only one vulnerable point, in its rear, where a small valley\r\nopens out into a plot of land bordering the bay. Here it was thought\r\ndesirable to land a body of men.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, 700 marines and sailors were put ashore. The men looked\r\nforward to an easy victory, and hurriedly, in detached and straggling\r\nstyle, pressed forward to secure it. Alas! they had reckoned without their\r\nhost—they were rushing heedlessly into the jaws of death. A number of\r\nbushes and small trees existed, and still exist, on the hill-sides\r\nsurrounding this spot, and behind them were posted Cossack sharp-shooters,\r\nwho fired into our men, and, either from skill or accident, picked off\r\nnearly every officer. The men, not seeing their enemy, and having lost\r\ntheir leaders, became panic-struck, and fell back in disorder. A retreat\r\nwas sounded, but the men struggling in the bushes and underbrush (and, in\r\ntruth, most of them being sailors, were out of their element on land)\r\nbecame much scattered, and it was generally believed that many were killed\r\nby the random shots of their companions. A number fled up a hill at the\r\nrear of the town; their foes pursued and pressed upon them, and many were\r\nkilled by falling over the steep cliff in which the hill terminates.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants, astonished at their own prowess, and knowing that they\r\ncould not hold the town against a more vigorous attack, were preparing to\r\nvacate it, when the fleet weighed anchor and set sail, and no more was\r\nseen of them that year! The sudden death of our admiral is always\r\nattributed to the events of that attack, as he was known not to have been\r\nkilled by a ball from the enemy.(96)\r\n\r\nThe writer has walked over the main battle-field, and saw cannon-balls\r\nunearthed when some men were digging gravel, which had laid there since\r\nthe events of 1854. The last time he passed over it, in 1866, was when\r\nproceeding with some Russian and American friends to what might be termed\r\nan “international” pic-nic, for there were present European and Asiatic\r\nRussians, full and half-breed natives, Americans, including genuine\r\n“Yankee” New Englanders, New Yorkers, Southerners, and Californians,\r\nEnglishmen, Frenchmen, Germans, and one Italian. Chatting in a babel of\r\ntongues, the party climbed a path on the hill-side, leading to a beautiful\r\ngrassy opening, overlooking the glorious bay below, which extended in all\r\ndirections a dozen or fifteen miles, and on one side farther than the eye\r\ncould reach. Several grand snow-covered volcanoes towered above, thirty to\r\nfifty miles off; one, of most beautiful outline, that of Vilutchinski, was\r\non the opposite shore of Avatcha Bay.\r\n\r\nThe sky was bright and blue, and the water without a ripple; wild flowers\r\nwere abundant, the air was fragrant with them, and, but for the mosquitoes\r\n(which are _not_ confined to hot countries, but flourish in the short\r\nsummer of semi-Arctic climes), it might have been considered an earthly\r\nedition of paradise! But even these pests could not worry the company\r\nmuch, for not merely were nearly all the men smokers, but most of the\r\nladies also! Here the writer may remark, parenthetically, that many of the\r\nRussian ladies smoke cigarettes, and none object to gentlemen smoking at\r\ntable or elsewhere. At the many dinners and suppers offered by the\r\nhospitable residents, it was customary to draw a few whiffs between the\r\ncourses; and when the cloth was removed, the ladies, instead of retiring\r\nto another room, sat in company with the gentlemen, the larger proportion\r\njoining in the social weed. After the enjoyment of a liberal _al fresco_\r\ndinner, songs were in order, and it would be easier to say what were not\r\nsung than to give the list of those, in all languages, which were. Then\r\nafter the songs came some games, one of them a Russian version of “hunt\r\nthe slipper,” and another _very_ like “kiss in the ring.” The writer\r\nparticularly remembers the latter, for he had on that occasion the honour\r\nof kissing the Pope’s wife! This needs explanation, although the Pope was\r\nhis friend. In the Greek Church the priest is “allowed to marry,” and his\r\ntitle, in the Russian language, is “Pope.”\r\n\r\nAnd the recollection of that particular “Pope” recalls a well-remembered\r\nceremony—that of a _double_ wedding in the old church. During the ceremony\r\nit is customary to crown the bride and bridegroom. In this case two\r\nconsiderate male friends held the crowns for three-quarters of an hour\r\nover the brides’ heads, so as not to spoil the artistic arrangement of\r\ntheir hair and head-gear. It seems also to be the custom, when, as in the\r\npresent case, the couples were in the humbler walks of life, to ask some\r\nwealthy individual to act as master of the ceremonies, who, if he accepts,\r\nhas to stand all the expenses. In this case M. Phillipeus, a merchant who\r\nhas many times crossed the frozen steppes of Siberia in search of valuable\r\nfurs, was the victim, and he accepted the responsibility of entertaining\r\nall Petropaulovski, the officers of the splendid Russian corvette, the\r\n_Variag_, and those of the Telegraph Expedition, with cheerfulness and\r\nalacrity.\r\n\r\nThe coast-line of Kamchatka is extremely grand, and far behind it are\r\nmagnificent volcanic peaks. The promontory which terminates in the two\r\ncapes, Kamchatka and Stolbevoy, has the appearance of two islands detached\r\nfrom the mainland, the intervening country being low. This, a circumstance\r\nto be constantly observed on all coasts, was, perhaps, specially\r\nnoticeable on this. The island of St. Lawrence, in Bering Sea, was a very\r\nprominent example. It is undeniable that the apparent gradual rise of a\r\ncoast, seen from the sea as you approach it, affords a far better proof of\r\nthe rotundity of the earth than the illustrations usually employed, that\r\nof a ship, which you are supposed to see by instalments, from the\r\nmain-royal sail (if not from the “sky-scraper” or “moon-raker”) to the\r\nhull. The fact is, that the royal and top-gallant sails of a vessel on the\r\nutmost verge of the horizon may be, in certain lights, barely\r\ndistinguishable, while the dark outline of an irregular and rock-bound\r\ncoast can be seen by any one. First, maybe, appears a mountain peak\r\ntowering in solitary grandeur above the coast-line, and often far behind\r\nit, then the high lands and hills, then the cliffs and low lands, and,\r\nlastly, the flats and beaches.\r\n\r\nIt was from the Kamchatka River, which enters Bering Sea near the cape of\r\nthe same name, that Vitus Bering sailed on his first voyage. That\r\nnavigator was a persevering and plucky Dane, who had been drawn into the\r\nservice of Russia through the fame of Peter the Great, and his first\r\nexpedition was directly planned by that sagacious monarch, although he did\r\nnot live to carry it out. Müller, the historian of Bering’s career, says:\r\n“The Empress Catherine, as she endeavoured in all points to execute most\r\nprecisely the plans of her deceased husband, in a manner began her reign\r\nwith an order for the expedition to Kamchatka.” Bering had associated with\r\nhim two active subordinates, Spanberg and Tschirikoff. They left St.\r\nPetersburg on February 5th, 1725, proceeding to the Ochotsk Sea, _viâ_\r\nSiberia. It is a tolerable proof of the difficulties of travel in those\r\ndays, that it took them _two years_ to transport their outfit thither.\r\nThey crossed to Kamchatka, where, on the 4th of April, 1728, Müller tells\r\nus, “a boat was put upon the stocks, like the packet-boats used in the\r\nBaltic, and on the 10th of July was launched, and named the boat\r\n_Gabriel_.” A few days later, and she was creeping along the coast of\r\nKamchatka and Eastern Siberia. Bering on this first voyage discovered St.\r\nLawrence Island, and reached as far north as 67° 18’, where, finding the\r\nland trend to the westward, he came to the conclusion that he had reached\r\nthe eastern extremity of Asia, and that Asia and America were distinct\r\ncontinents. On the first point he was not, as a matter of detail, quite\r\ncorrect; but the second, the important object of his mission, settled for\r\never the vexed question.\r\n\r\nA second voyage was rather unsuccessful. His third expedition left\r\nPetropaulovski on the 4th of July, 1741. His little fleet became dispersed\r\nin a storm, and Bering pursued his discoveries alone. These were not\r\nunimportant, for he reached the grand chain of the rock-girt Aleutian\r\nIslands, and others nearer the mainland of America. At length the scurvy\r\nbroke out in virulent form among his crew, and he attempted to return to\r\nKamchatka. The sickness increased so much that the “two sailors who used\r\nto be at the rudder were obliged to be led in by two others who could\r\nhardly walk, and when one could sit and steer no longer, one in little\r\nbetter condition supplied his place. Many sails they durst not hoist,\r\nbecause there was nobody to lower them in case of need.” At length land\r\nappeared, and they cast anchor. A storm arose, and the ship was driven on\r\nthe rocks; they cast their second anchor, and the cable snapped before it\r\ntook ground. A great sea pitched the vessel bodily over the rocks, behind\r\nwhich they happily found quieter water. The island was barren, devoid of\r\ntrees, and with little driftwood. They had to roof over gulches or\r\nravines, to form places of refuge. On the “8th of November a beginning was\r\nmade to land the sick; but some died as soon as they were brought from\r\nbetween decks in the open air, others during the time they were on the\r\ndeck, some in the boat, and many more as soon as they were brought on\r\nshore.” On the following day the commander, Bering, himself prostrated\r\nwith disease, was brought ashore, and moved about on a hand-barrow. He\r\ndied a month after, in one of the little ravines, or ditches, which had\r\nbeen covered with a roof, and when he expired was almost covered with the\r\nsand which fell from its sides, and which he desired his men not to\r\nremove, as it gave him some little warmth. Before his remains could be\r\nfinally interred they had literally to be disinterred.\r\n\r\nThe vessel, unguarded, was utterly wrecked, and their provisions lost.\r\nThey subsisted mainly that fearful winter on the carcases of dead whales,\r\nwhich were driven ashore. In the spring the pitiful remnant of a once\r\nhardy crew managed to construct a small vessel from the wreck of their old\r\nship, and at length succeeded in reaching Kamchatka. They then learned\r\nthat Tschirikoff, Bering’s associate, had preceded them, but with the loss\r\nof thirty-one of his crew from the same fell disease which had so reduced\r\ntheir numbers. Bering’s name has ever since been attached to the island\r\nwhere he died.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Kamchatka would repay a detailed exploration, which\r\nit has never yet received. It is a partially settled country. The\r\nKamchatdales are a good-humoured, harmless, and semi-civilised race, and\r\nthe Russian officials and settlers at the few little towns would gladly\r\nwelcome the traveller. The dogs used for sledging in winter are noble\r\nanimals, infinitely stronger than those of Alaska or even Greenland. The\r\nattractions for the Alpine climber cannot be overstated. The peninsula\r\ncontains a chain of volcanic peaks, attaining, it is stated, in the\r\nKlutchevskoi Mountain a height of 16,000 feet. In the country immediately\r\nbehind Petropaulovski are the three peaks, Koriatski, Avatcha, and\r\nKoseldskai; the first is about 12,000 feet in height, and is a conspicuous\r\nlandmark for the port. A comparatively level country, covered with rank\r\ngrass and underbrush, and intersected by streams, stretches very nearly to\r\ntheir base.\r\n\r\n         [Illustration: PETROPAULOVSKI AND THE AVATCHA MOUNTAIN.]\r\n\r\nAnd now, before leaving the Asiatic coast, let us, as many English naval\r\nvessels have done, pay a flying visit to a still more northern harbour,\r\nthat of Plover Bay, which forms the very apex of the China Station.\r\nSailing, or steaming, through Bering Sea, it is satisfactory to know that\r\nso shallow is it that a vessel can anchor in almost any part of it, though\r\nhundreds of miles from land.(97) Plover Bay does _not_ derive its name\r\nfrom the whaling which is often pursued in its waters, although an\r\ningenious Dutchman, of the service in which the writer was engaged at the\r\nperiods of his visits, persisted in calling it “Blubber” Bay; its name is\r\ndue to the visit of H.M.S. _Plover_ in 1848-9, when engaged in the search\r\nfor Sir John Franklin. The bay is a most secure haven, sheltered at the\r\nocean end by a long spit, and walled in on three sides by rugged mountains\r\nand bare cliffs, the former composed of an infinite number of fragments of\r\nrock, split up by the action of frost. Besides many coloured lichens and\r\nmosses, there is hardly a sign of vegetation, except at one patch of\r\ncountry near a small inner harbour, where domesticated reindeer graze. On\r\nthe spit before mentioned is a village of Tchuktchi natives; their tents\r\nare composed of hide, walrus, seal, or reindeer, with here and there a\r\npiece of old sail-cloth, obtained from the whalers, the whole patchwork\r\ncovering a framework formed of the large bones of whales and walrus. The\r\nremains of underground houses are seen, but the people who used them have\r\npassed away. The present race makes no use of such houses. Their canoes\r\nare of skin, covering sometimes a wooden and sometimes a bone frame. On\r\neither side of one of these craft, which is identical with the Greenland\r\n“oomiak,” or women’s boat, it is usual to have a sealskin blown out tight,\r\nand the ends fastened to the gunwale; these serve as floats to steady the\r\ncanoe. They often carry sail, and proceed safely far out to sea, even\r\ncrossing Bering Straits to the American side. The natives are a hardy\r\nrace; the writer has seen one of them carry the awkward burden of a\r\ncarpenter’s chest, weighing two hundred pounds, without apparent exertion.\r\nOne of their principal men was of considerable service to the expedition\r\nand to a party of telegraph constructors, who were left there in a wooden\r\nhouse made in San Francisco, and erected in a few days in this barren\r\nspot. This native, by name Naukum, was taken down into the engine-room of\r\nthe telegraph steamer—_G. S. Wright_. He looked round carefully and\r\nthoughtfully, and then, shaking his head, said, solemnly, “Too muchee\r\nwheel; makee man too muchee think!” His curiosity on board was\r\nunappeasable. “What’s that fellow?” was his query with regard to anything,\r\nfrom the donkey-engine to the hencoops. Colonel Bulkley gave him a suit of\r\nmock uniform, gorgeous with buttons. One of the men remarked to him, “Why,\r\nNaukum, you’ll be a king soon!” But this magnificent prospect did not\r\nseem, judging from the way he received it, to be much to his taste. This\r\nman had been sometimes entrusted with as much as five barrels of\r\nvillainous whisky for trading purposes, and he had always accounted\r\nsatisfactorily to the trader for its use. The whisky sold to the natives\r\nis of the most horrible kind, scarcely superior to “coal oil” or\r\nparaffine. They appeared to understand the telegraph scheme in a general\r\nway. One explaining it, said, “S’pose lope fixy, well; one Melican man\r\nPlower Bay, make talky all same San Flancisco Melican.” Perhaps quite as\r\nlucid an explanation as you could get from an agricultural labourer or a\r\nstreet arab at home.\r\n\r\nColonel Bulkley, at his second visit to Plover Bay, caused a small house\r\nof planks to be constructed for Naukum, and made him many presents. A\r\ndraughtsman attached to the party made a sketch, “A Dream of the Future,”\r\nwhich was a lively representation of the future prospects of Naukum and\r\nhis family. The room was picturesque with paddles, skins, brand-new Henry\r\nrifles, preserved meat tins, &c.; and civilisation was triumphant.\r\n\r\nAlthough Plover Bay is almost in sight of the Arctic Ocean, very little\r\nsnow remained on the barren country round it, except on the distant\r\nmountains, or in deep ravines, where it has lain for ages. “That there\r\nsnow,” said one of the sailors, pointing to such a spot, “is three hundred\r\nyears old if it’s a day. Why, don’t you see the wrinkles all over the face\r\nof it?” Wrinkles and ridges are common enough in snow; but the idea of\r\nassociating age with them was original.\r\n\r\nThe whalers are often very successful in and outside Plover Bay in\r\nsecuring their prey. Each boat is known by its own private mark—a cross,\r\nred stripes, or what not—on its sail, so that at a distance they can be\r\ndistinguished from their respective vessels. When the whale is harpooned,\r\noften a long and dangerous job, and is floating dead in the water, a small\r\nflag is planted in it. After the monster is towed alongside the vessel, it\r\nis cut up into large rectangular chunks, and it is a curious and not\r\naltogether pleasant sight to witness the deck of a whaling ship covered\r\nwith blubber. This can be either barreled, or the oil “tryed out” on the\r\nspot. If the latter, the blubber is cut into “mincemeat,” and chopping\r\nknives, and even mincing machines, are employed. The oil is boiled out on\r\nboard, and the vessel when seen at a distance looks as if on fire. On\r\nthese occasions the sailors have a feast of dough-nuts, which are cooked\r\nin boiling whale-oil, fritters of whale brain, and other dishes. The\r\nwriter has tasted whale in various shapes, but although it is eatable, it\r\nis by no means luxurious food.\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: WHALERS AT WORK.]\r\n\r\nIt was in these waters of Bering Sea and the Arctic that the _Shenandoah_\r\nplayed such havoc during the American war. In 1865 she burned _thirty_\r\nAmerican whalers, taking off the officers and crews, and sending them down\r\nto San Francisco. The captain of an English whaler, the _Robert Tawns_, of\r\nSydney, had warned and saved some American vessels, and was in consequence\r\nthreatened by the pirate captain. The writer was an eye-witness of the\r\nresults of this wanton destruction of private property. The coasts were\r\nstrewed with the remains of the burned vessels, while the natives had\r\nboats, spars, &c., in numbers.\r\n\r\nBut Plover Bay has an interest attaching to it of far more importance than\r\nanything to be said about whaling or Arctic expeditions. It is more than\r\nprobable that from or near that bay the wandering Tunguse, or Tchuktchi,\r\ncrossed Bering Straits, and peopled America. The latter, in canoes holding\r\nfifteen or twenty persons, do it now; why not in the “long ago?” The\r\nwriter has, in common with many who have visited Alaska (formerly\r\nRussian-America, before the country was purchased by the United States),\r\nremarked the almost Chinese or Japanese cast of features possessed by the\r\ncoast natives of that country. Their Asiatic origin could not be doubted,\r\nand, on the other hand, Aleuts—natives of the Aleutian Islands, which\r\nstretch out in a grand chain from Alaska—who had shipped as sailors on the\r\nRusso-American Telegraph Expedition, and a Tchuktchi boy brought down to\r\nbe educated, were constantly taken for Japanese or Chinamen in San\r\nFrancisco, where there are 40,000 of the former people. Junks have on two\r\noccasions been driven across the Pacific Ocean, and have landed their\r\ncrews.(98) These facts occurred in 1832-3; the first on the coast near\r\nCape Flattery, North-west America, and the second in the harbour of Oahu,\r\nSandwich (Hawaiian) Islands. In the former case all the crew but two men\r\nand a boy were killed by the natives. In the latter case, however, the\r\nSandwich Islanders treated the nine Japanese, forming the crew of the\r\njunk, with kindness, and, when they saw the strangers so much resembling\r\nthem in many respects, said, “It is plain, now, we come from Asia.” How\r\neasily, then, could we account for the peopling of any island or coast in\r\nthe Pacific. Whether, therefore, stress of weather obliged some\r\nunfortunate Chinamen or Japanese to people America, or whether they, or,\r\nat all events, some Northern Asiatics, took the “short sea route,” _viâ_\r\nBering Straits, there is a very strong probability in favour of the New\r\nWorld having been peopled from not merely the Old World, but the Oldest\r\nWorld—Asia.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific Ocean generally bears itself in a manner which justifies its\r\ntitle. The long sweeps of its waves are far more pleasant to the sailor\r\nthan the “choppy” waves of the Atlantic. But the Pacific is by no means\r\nalways so, as the writer very well knows. He will not soon forget\r\nNovember, 1865, nor will those of his companions who still survive.\r\n\r\nLeaving Petropaulovski on November 1st, a fortnight of what sailors term\r\n“dirty weather” culminated in a gale from the south-east. It was no\r\n“capful of wind,” but a veritable tempest, which broke over the devoted\r\nship. At its outset, the wind was so powerful that it blew the main-boom\r\nfrom the ropes which held it, and it swung round with great violence\r\nagainst the “smoke-stack” (funnel) of the steamer, knocking it overboard.\r\nThe guys, or chains by which it had been held upright, were snapped, and\r\nit went to the bottom. Here was a dilemma; the engines were rendered\r\nnearly useless, and a few hours later were made absolutely powerless, for\r\nthe rudder became disabled, and the steering-wheel was utterly\r\nunavailable. During this period a very curious circumstance happened; the\r\nsea driving faster than the vessel—itself a log lying in the trough of the\r\nwaves, which rose in mountains on all sides—acted on the screw in such a\r\nmanner that in its turn it worked the engines at a greater rate than they\r\nhad ever attained by steam! After much trouble the couplings were\r\ndisconnected, but for several hours the jarring of the machinery revolving\r\nat lightning speed threatened to make a breach in the stern.\r\n\r\nNo one on board will soon forget the night of that great gale. The vessel,\r\nscarcely larger than a “penny” steamer, and having “guards,” or bulwarks,\r\nlittle higher than the rail of those boats, was engulfed in the\r\ntempestuous waters. It seemed literally to be driving under the water.\r\nWaves broke over it every few minutes; a rope had to be stretched along\r\nthe deck for the sailors to hold on by, while the brave commander, Captain\r\nMarston, was literally _tied_ to the aft bulwark, where, half frozen and\r\nhalf drowned, he remained at his post during an entire night. The steamer\r\nhad the “house on deck,” so common in American vessels. It was divided\r\ninto state-rooms, very comfortably fitted, but had doors and windows of\r\nthe lightest character. At the commencement of the gale, these were\r\nliterally battered to pieces by the waves dashing over the vessel; it was\r\na matter of doubt whether the whole house might not be carried off bodily.\r\nThe officers of the expedition took refuge in the small cabin aft, which\r\nhad been previously the general ward-room of the vessel, where the meals\r\nwere served. A great sea broke over its skylight, smashing the glass to\r\natoms, putting out the lamps and stove, and filling momentarily the cabin\r\nwith about three feet of water. A landsman would have thought his last\r\nhour had come. But the hull of the vessel was sound; the pumps were in\r\ngood order, and worked steadily by a “donkey” engine in the engine-room,\r\nand the water soon disappeared. The men coiled themselves up that night\r\namid a pile of ropes and sails, boxes, and miscellaneous matters lying on\r\nthe “counter” of the vessel, _i.e._, that part of the stern lying\r\nimmediately over the rudder. Next morning, in place of the capital\r\nbreakfasts all had been enjoying—fish and game from Kamchatka, tinned\r\nfruits and meats from California, hot rolls and cakes—the steward and cook\r\ncould only, with great difficulty, provide some rather shaky coffee and\r\nthe regular “hard bread” (biscuit) of the ship.\r\n\r\nThe storm increased in violence; it was unsafe to venture on deck. The\r\nwriter’s room-mate, M. Laborne, a genial and cultivated man of the world,\r\nwho spoke seven languages fluently, sat down, and wrote a last letter to\r\nhis mother, enclosing it afterwards in a bottle. “It will never reach\r\nher,” said poor Laborne, with tears dimming his eyes; “but it is all I can\r\ndo.” Each tried to comfort the other, and prepare for the worst. “If we\r\nare to die, let us die like men,” said Adjutant Wright. “Come down in the\r\nengine-room,” another said, “and if we’ve got to die, let’s die decently.”\r\nThe chief engineer lighted a fire on the iron floor below the boilers, and\r\nit was the only part of the vessel which was at all comfortable.\r\nNoble-hearted Colonel Bulkley spent his time in cheering the men, and\r\nreminding them that the sea has been proved to be an infinitely safer\r\nplace than the land. No single one on board really expected to survive.\r\nMeantime, the gale was expending its rage by tearing every sail to\r\nribbons. Rags and streamers fluttered from the yards; there was not a\r\nsingle piece of canvas intact. The cabins held a wreck of trunks,\r\nfurniture, and crockery.\r\n\r\nIn one of the cabins several boxes of soap, in bars, had been stored. When\r\nthe gale commenced to abate, some one ventured into the house on deck,\r\nwhen it was discovered that it was full of soapsuds, which swashed\r\nbackwards and forwards through the series of rooms. The water had washed\r\nand rewashed the bars of soap till they were not thicker than sticks of\r\nsealing-wax.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: OUR “PATENT SMOKE-STACK.”]\r\n\r\nAt last, after a week of this horrible weather, morning broke with a sight\r\nof the sun, and moderate wind. There were spare sails on board, and the\r\nrudder could be repaired; but what could be done about the funnel? The\r\nengineer’s ingenuity came out conspicuously. He had one of the usual\r\nwater-tanks brought on deck, and the two ends knocked out. Then, setting\r\nit up over the boiler, he with pieces of sheet-iron raised this square\r\nerection till it was about nine feet high, and it gave a sufficient\r\ndraught to the furnaces. “Covert’s Patent Smoke-Stack” created a sensation\r\non the safe arrival of the vessel in San Francisco, and was inspected by\r\nhundreds of visitors. The little steamer had ploughed through 10,000 miles\r\nof water that season. She was immediately taken to one of the wharfs, and\r\nentirely remodelled. The sides were slightly raised, and a ward-room and\r\naft-cabin, handsomely fitted in yacht-fashion, took the place of the house\r\non deck. It was roofed or decked at top in such a manner that the heaviest\r\nseas could wash over the vessel without doing the slightest injury, and\r\nshe afterwards made two voyages, going over a distance of 20,000 miles.\r\nPoor old _Wright_! She went to the bottom at last, with all her crew and\r\npassengers, some years later, off Cape Flattery, at the entrance of the\r\nStraits of Fuca, and scarcely a vestige of her was ever found.\r\n\r\nAnd now, retracing our steps _en route_ for the Australian station, let us\r\ncall at one of the most important of England’s settlements, which has been\r\ntermed the Liverpool of the East. Singapore consists of an island\r\ntwenty-five miles long and fifteen or so broad, lying off the south\r\nextremity of Malacca, and having a city of the same name on its southern\r\nside. The surface is very level, the highest elevation being only 520\r\nfeet. In 1818, Sir Stamford Raffles found it an island covered with virgin\r\nforests and dense jungles, with a miserable population on its creeks and\r\nrivers of fishermen and pirates. It has now a population of about 100,000,\r\nof which Chinese number more than half. In 1819 the British flag was\r\nhoisted over the new settlement; but it took five years on the part of Mr.\r\nCrawford, the diplomatic representative of Great Britain, to negotiate\r\nterms with its then owner, the Sultan of Johore, whereby for a heavy\r\nyearly payment it was, with all the islands within ten miles of the coast,\r\ngiven up with absolute possession to the Honourable East India Company.\r\nSince that period, its history has been one of unexampled prosperity. It\r\nis a free port, the revenue being raised entirely from imports on opium\r\nand spirits. Its prosperity as a commercial port is due to the fact that\r\nit is an entrepôt for the whole trade of the Malayan Archipelago, the\r\nEastern Archipelago, Cochin China, Siam, and Java. Twelve years ago it\r\nexported over sixty-six million rupees’ worth of gambier, tin, pepper,\r\nnutmegs, coffee, tortoise-shell, rare woods, sago, tapioca, camphor,\r\ngutta-percha, and rattans. It is vastly greater now. Exclusive of\r\ninnumerable native craft, 1,697 square-rigged vessels entered the port in\r\n1864-5. It has two splendid harbours, one a sheltered roadstead near the\r\ntown, with safe anchorage; the other, a land-locked harbour, three miles\r\nfrom the town, capable of admitting vessels of the largest draught.\r\nSplendid wharfs have been erected by the many steam-ship companies and\r\nmerchants, and there are fortifications which command the harbour and\r\nroads.\r\n\r\n“A great deal has been written about the natural beauties of Ceylon and\r\nJava,” says Mr. Cameron,(99) “and some theologians, determined to give the\r\nfirst scene in the Mosaic narrative a local habitation, have fixed the\r\nparadise of unfallen man on one or other of those noble islands. Nor has\r\ntheir enthusiasm carried them to any ridiculous extreme; for the beauty of\r\nsome parts of Java and Ceylon might well accord with the description given\r\nus, or rather which we are accustomed to infer, of that land from which\r\nman was driven on his first great sin.\r\n\r\n“I have seen both Ceylon and Java, and admired in no grudging measure\r\ntheir many charms; but for calm placid loveliness, I should place\r\nSingapore high above them both. It is a loveliness, too, that at once\r\nstrikes the eye, from whatever point we view the island, which combines\r\nall the advantages of an always beautiful and often imposing coast-line,\r\nwith an endless succession of hill and dale stretching inland. The entire\r\ncircumference of the island is one panorama, where the magnificent\r\ntropical forest, with its undergrowth of jungle, runs down at one place to\r\nthe very water’s edge, dipping its large leaves in the glassy sea, and at\r\nanother is abruptly broken by a brown rocky cliff, or a late landslip,\r\nover which the jungle has not yet had time to extend itself. Here and\r\nthere, too, are scattered little green islands, set like gems on the bosom\r\nof the hushed waters, between which the excursionist, the trader, or the\r\npirate, is wont to steer his course. ‘Eternal summer gilds these shores;’\r\nno sooner has the blossom of one tree passed away, than that of another\r\ntakes its place and sheds perfume all around. As for the foliage, that\r\nnever seems to die. Perfumed isles are in many people’s minds merely\r\nfabled dreams, but they are easy of realisation here. There is scarcely a\r\npart of the island, except those few places where the original forest and\r\njungle have been cleared away, from which at night-time, on the first\r\nbreathings of the land winds, may not be felt those lovely forest\r\nperfumes, even at the distance of more than a mile from shore. These land\r\nwinds—or, more properly, land airs, for they can scarcely be said to blow,\r\nbut only to breathe—usually commence at ten o’clock at night, and continue\r\nwithin an hour or two of sunrise. They are welcomed by all—by the sailor\r\nbecause they speed him on either course, and by the wearied resident\r\nbecause of their delicious coolness.”\r\n\r\nAnother writer(100) speaks with the same enthusiasm of the well-kept\r\ncountry roads, and approaches to the houses of residents, where one may\r\ntravel for miles through unbroken avenues of fruit-trees, or beneath an\r\nover-arching canopy of evergreen palms. The long and well-kept approaches\r\nto the European dwellings never fail to win the praise of strangers. “In\r\nthem may be discovered the same lavish profusion of overhanging foliage\r\nwhich we see around us on every side; besides that, there are often hedges\r\nof wild heliotrope, cropped as square as if built up of stone, and forming\r\ncompact barriers of green leaves, which yet blossom with gold and purple\r\nflowers.” Behind these, broad bananas nod their bending leaves, while a\r\nchoice flower-garden, a close-shaven lawn, and a croquet-ground, are not\r\nuncommonly the surroundings of the residence. If it is early morning,\r\nthere is an unspeakable charm about the spot. The air is cool, even\r\nbracing; and beneath the shade of forest trees, the rich blossom of\r\norchids are seen depending from the boughs, while songless birds twitter\r\namong the foliage, or beneath shrubs which the convolvulus has decked with\r\na hundred variegated flowers. Here and there the slender stem of the aloe,\r\nrising from an armoury of spiked leaves, lifts its cone of white bells on\r\nhigh, or the deep orange pine-apple peeps out from a green belt of fleshy\r\nfoliage, and breathes its bright fragrance around. The house will\r\ninvariably have a spacious verandah, underneath which flowers in China\r\nvases, and easy chairs of all kinds, are placed. If perfect peace can\r\nsteal through the senses into the soul—if it can be distilled like some\r\nsubtle ether from all that is beautiful in nature—surely in such an island\r\nas this we shall find that supreme happiness which we all know to be\r\nunattainable elsewhere. Alas! even in this bright spot, unalloyed bliss\r\ncannot be expected. The temperature is very high, showing an average in\r\nthe shade, all the year round, of between 85° and 95° Fahr. Prickly heat,\r\nand many other disorders, are caused by it on the European constitution.\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: VIEW IN THE STRAITS OF MALACCA.]\r\n\r\nThe old Strait of Singhapura, that lies between the island of Singapore\r\nand the mainland of Johore, is a narrow tortuous passage, for many\r\ncenturies the only thoroughfare for ships passing to the eastward of\r\nMalacca. Not many years ago, where charming bungalows, the residences of\r\nthe merchants, are built among the ever verdant foliage, it was but the\r\nhome of hordes of piratical marauders, who carried on their depredations\r\nwith a high hand, sometimes adventuring on distant voyages in fleets of\r\nforty or fifty prahus. Indeed, it is stated, in the old Malay annals, that\r\nfor nearly two hundred years the entire population of Singapore and the\r\nsurrounding islands and coasts of Johore subsisted on fishing and\r\npirating; the former only being resorted to when the prevailing monsoon\r\nwas too strong to admit of the successful prosecution of the latter.\r\nSingle cases of piracy sometimes occur now; but it has been nearly\r\nstopped. Of the numberless vessels and boats which give life to the waters\r\nof the old strait, nearly all have honest work to do—fishing, timber\r\ncarrying, or otherwise trading. “A very extraordinary flotilla,” says Mr.\r\nCameron, “of a rather nondescript character may be often seen in this part\r\nof the strait at certain seasons of the year. These are huge rafts of\r\nunsawn, newly-cut timber; they are generally 500 or 600 feet long, and\r\nsixty or seventy broad, the logs being skilfully laid together, and\r\ncarefully bound by strong rattan-rope, each raft often containing 2,000\r\nlogs. They have always one or two attap-houses built upon them, and carry\r\ncrews of twenty or twenty-five men, the married men taking their wives and\r\nchildren with them. The timber composing them is generally cut many miles\r\naway, in some creek or river on the mainland.” They sometimes have sails.\r\nThey will irresistibly remind the traveller of those picturesque rafts on\r\nthe Rhine, on which there are cabins, with the smoke curling from their\r\nstove-pipes, and women, children, and dogs, the men with long sweeps\r\nkeeping the valuable floating freight in the current. Many a German, now\r\nin England or America, made his first trip through the Fatherland to its\r\ncoast on a Rhine raft.\r\n\r\nThe sailor generally makes his first acquaintance with the island of\r\nSingapore by entering through New Harbour, and the scenery is said to be\r\nalmost unsurpassed by anything in the world. The steamer enters between\r\nthe large island and a cluster of islets, standing high out of the water\r\nwith rocky banks, and covered to their summits by rich green jungle, with\r\nhere and there a few forest trees towering above it high in the air. Under\r\nthe vessel’s keel, too, as she passes slowly over the shoaler patches of\r\nthe entrance, may be seen beautiful beds of coral, which, in their\r\nvariegated colours and fantastic shapes, vie with the scenery above. The\r\nPeninsular and Oriental Steamers’ wharfs are situated at the head of a\r\nsmall bay, with the island of Pulo Brani in front. They have a frontage of\r\n1,200 feet, and coal sheds built of brick, and tile-roofed; they often\r\ncontain 20,000 tons of coal. Including some premises in Singapore itself,\r\nsome £70,000 or £80,000 have been expended on their station—a tolerable\r\nproof of the commercial importance of the place. Two other companies have\r\nextensive wharfs also. The passengers land here, and drive up to the city,\r\na distance of some three miles. Those who remain on board, and “Jack” is\r\nlikely to be of the number, for the first few days after arrival, find\r\nentertainment in the feats of swarms of small Malay boys, who immediately\r\nsurround the vessel in toy boats just big enough to float them, and induce\r\nthe passengers to throw small coins into the water, for which they dive to\r\nthe bottom, and generally succeed in recovering. Almost all the ships\r\nvisiting Singapore have their bottoms examined, and some have had as many\r\nas twenty or thirty sheets of copper put on by Malay divers. One man will\r\nput on as many as two sheets in an hour, going down a dozen or more times.\r\nThere are now extensive docks at and around New Harbour.\r\n\r\nOn rounding the eastern exit of New Harbour, the shipping and harbour of\r\nSingapore at once burst on the view, with the white walls of the houses,\r\nand the dark verdure of the shrubbery of the town nearly hidden by the\r\nnetwork of spars and rigging that intervenes. The splendid boats of the\r\nFrench Messageries, and our own Peninsular and Oriental lines, the opium\r\nsteamers of the great firm of Messrs. Jardine, of China, and Messrs. Cama,\r\nof Bombay; and the beautifully-modelled American or English clippers,\r\nwhich have taken the place of the box-shaped, heavy-rigged East Indiamen\r\nof days of yore, with men-of-war of all nations, help to make a noble\r\nsight. This is only part of the scene, for interspersed are huge Chinese\r\njunks of all sizes, ranging up to 600 or 700 tons measurement. The\r\nsampans, or two-oared Chinese boats, used to convey passengers ashore, are\r\nidentical in shape. All have alike the square bow and the broad flat\r\nstern, and from the largest to the smallest, on what in a British vessel\r\nwould be called her “head-boards,” all have two eyes embossed and painted,\r\nglaring out over the water. John Chinaman’s explanation of this custom is,\r\nthat if “no got eyes, no can see.” During the south-west monsoon they are\r\nin Singapore by scores, and of all colours, red, green, black, or yellow;\r\nthese are said to be the badge of the particular province to which they\r\nbelong. Ornamental painting and carving is confined principally to the\r\nhigh stern, which generally bears some fantastic figuring, conspicuous in\r\nwhich can invariably be traced the outlines of a spread eagle, not unlike\r\nthat on an American dollar. Did “spread-eagleism” as well as population\r\nfirst reach America from China?\r\n\r\n“It is difficult,” says Mr. Cameron, “while looking at these junks, to\r\nimagine how they can manage in a seaway; and yet at times they must\r\nencounter the heaviest weather along the Chinese coast in the northern\r\nlatitudes. It is true that when they encounter a gale they generally run\r\nbefore it; but yet in a typhoon this would be of little avail to ease a\r\nship. There is no doubt they must possess some good qualities, and,\r\nprobably, speed, with a fair wind in a smooth sea, is one of them. Not\r\nmany years ago a boat-builder in Singapore bought one of the common\r\nsampans used by the coolie boatmen, which are exactly the same shape as\r\nthe junks, and rigged her like an English cutter, giving her a false keel,\r\nand shifting weather-board, and, strange to say, won with her every race\r\nthat he tried.”\r\n\r\nPassing the junks at night, a strange spectacle may be observed. Amid the\r\nbeating of gongs, jangling of bells, and discordant shouts, the nightly\r\nreligious ceremonies of the sailors are performed. Lanterns are swinging,\r\ntorches flaring, and gilt paper burning, while quantities of food are\r\nscattered in the sea as an offering of their worship. Many of those junks,\r\ncould they but speak, might reveal a story, gentle reader—\r\n\r\n  “A tale unfold, whose lightest word\r\n  Would harrow up thy soul.”\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: JUNKS IN A CHINESE HARBOUR.]\r\n\r\nThe chief trade of not a few has been, and still is, the traffic of human\r\nfreight; and it is, unfortunately, only too lucrative. Large numbers of\r\njunks leave China for the islands annually packed with men, picked up,\r\nimpressed, or lured on board, and kept there till the gambier and pepper\r\nplanters purchase them, and hurry them off to the interior. It is not so\r\nmuch that they usually have to complain of cruelty, or even an\r\nunreasonably long term of servitude; their real danger is in the\r\novercrowding of the vessels that bring them. The men cost nothing, except\r\na meagre allowance of rice, and the more the shipper can crowd into his\r\nvessel the greater must be his profit. “It would,” says the writer just\r\nquoted, “be a better speculation for the trader whose junk could only\r\ncarry properly 300 men, to take on board 600 men, and lose 250 on the way\r\ndown, than it would be for him to start with his legitimate number, and\r\nland them all safely; for in the first case, he would bring 350 men to\r\nmarket, and in the other only 300. That this process of reasoning is\r\nactually put in practice by the Chinese, there was not long ago ample and\r\nvery mournful evidence to prove. Two of these junks had arrived in the\r\nharbour of Singapore, and had remained unnoticed for about a week, during\r\nwhich the owners had bargained for the engagement of most of their cargo.\r\nAt this time two dead bodies were found floating in the harbour; an\r\ninquest was held, and it then transpired that one of these two junks on\r\nthe way down from China had lost 250 men out of 600, and the other 200 out\r\nof 400.”\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: ISLANDS IN THE STRAITS OF MALACCA.]\r\n\r\nThe Malay prahus are the craft of the inhabitants of the straits, and are\r\nsomething like the Chinese junks, though never so large as the largest of\r\nthe latter, rarely exceeding fifty or sixty tons burden. They have one\r\nmast, a tripod made of three bamboos, two or three feet apart at the deck,\r\nand tapering up to a point at the top. Across two of the bamboos smaller\r\npieces of the same wood are lashed, making the mast thus act as a shroud\r\nor ladder also. They carry a large lug-sail of coarse grass-cloth, having\r\na yard both at top and bottom. The curious part of them is the top hamper\r\nabout the stem. With the deck three feet out of the water forward, the top\r\nof the housing is fifteen or more feet high. They are steered with two\r\nrudders, one on either quarter. In addition to the ships and native craft,\r\nare hundreds of small boats of all descriptions constantly moving about\r\nwith fruits, provisions, birds, monkeys, shells, and corals for sale. The\r\nsailor has a splendid chance of securing, on merely nominal terms, the\r\ninevitable parrot, a funny little Jocko, or some lovely corals, of all\r\nhues, green, purple, pink, mauve, blue, and in shape often resembling\r\nflowers and shrubbery. A whole boat-load of the latter may be obtained for\r\na dollar and a half or a couple of dollars.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: CHINESE JUNK AT SINGAPORE.]\r\n\r\nSingapore has a frontage of three miles, and has fine Government\r\nbuildings, court-house, town-hall, clubs, institutes, masonic lodge,\r\ntheatre, and the grandest English cathedral in Asia—that of St. Andrew’s.\r\nIn Commercial Square, the business centre of Singapore, all nationalities\r\nseem to be represented. Here, too, are the Kling gharry-drivers, having\r\nactive little ponies and neat conveyances. Jack ashore will be pestered\r\nwith their applications. “These Klings,” says Mr. Thomson, “seldom, if\r\never, resort to blows; but their language leaves nothing for the most\r\nvindictive spirit to desire. Once, at one of the landing-places, I\r\nobserved a British tar come ashore for a holiday. He was forthwith beset\r\nby a group of Kling gharry-drivers, and, finding that the strongest of\r\nBritish words were as nothing when pitted against the Kling vocabulary,\r\nand that no half-dozen of them would stand up like men against his huge\r\niron fists, he seized the nearest man, and hurled him into the sea. It was\r\nthe most harmless way of disposing of his enemy, who swam to a boat, and\r\nit left Jack in undisturbed and immediate possession of the field.” The\r\nnaval officer will find excellent deer-hunting and wild-hog shooting to be\r\nhad near the city, and tiger-hunting at a distance. Tigers, indeed, were\r\nformerly terribly destructive of native life on the island; it was said\r\nthat a man _per diem_ was sacrificed. Now, cases are more rare. For good\r\nliving, Singapore can hardly be beaten; fruit in particular is abundant\r\nand cheap. Pine-apples, cocoa-nuts, bananas of thirty varieties, mangoes,\r\ncustard-apples, and oranges, with many commoner fruits, abound. Then there\r\nis the mangosteen, the delicious “apple of the East,” thought by many to\r\nsurpass any fruit in the world, and the durian, a fruit as big as a boy’s\r\nhead, with seeds as big as walnuts enclosed in a pulpy, fruity custard.\r\nThe taste for this fruit is an acquired one, and is impossible to\r\ndescribe, while the smell is most disgusting. So great is the longing for\r\nit, when once the taste _is_ acquired, that the highest prices are freely\r\noffered for it, particularly by some of the rich natives. A former King of\r\nAva spent enormous sums over it, and could hardly then satisfy his\r\nrapacious appetite. A succeeding monarch kept a special steamer at\r\nRangoon, and when the supplies came into the city it was loaded up, and\r\ndispatched at once to the capital—500 miles up a river. The smell of the\r\ndurian is so unpleasant that the fruit is never seen on the tables of the\r\nmerchants or planters; it is eaten slily in corners, and out of doors.\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: SINGAPORE, LOOKING SEAWARDS.]\r\n\r\nAnd Jack ashore will find many other novelties in eating. Roast monkey is\r\nobtainable, although not eaten as much as formerly by the Malays. In the\r\nstreets of Singapore a meal of three or four courses can be obtained for\r\nthree halfpence from travelling _restaurateurs_, always Chinamen, who\r\ncarry their little charcoal stoves and soup-pots with them. The authority\r\nprincipally quoted says that, contrary to received opinion, they are very\r\nclean and particular in their culinary arrangements. One must not,\r\nhowever, too closely examine the nature of the viands. And now let us\r\nproceed to the Australian Station, which includes New Guinea, Australia\r\nproper, and New Zealand.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: LOOKING DOWN ON SINGAPORE.]\r\n\r\nThis is a most important colony of Great Britain, although by no means its\r\nmost important possession, a country as English as England itself,\r\ntempered only by a slight colonial flavour. Here Jack will find himself at\r\nhome, whether in the fine streets of Melbourne, or the older and more\r\npleasant city of Sydney, with its beautiful surroundings.\r\n\r\nWhen the seventeenth century was in its early youth, that vast ocean which\r\nstretches from Asia to the Antarctic was scarcely known by navigators. The\r\ncoasts of Eastern Africa, of India, and the archipelago of islands to the\r\neastward, were partially explored; but while there was a very strong\r\nbelief that a land existed in the southern hemisphere, it was an\r\ninspiration only based on probabilities. The pilots and map-makers put\r\ndown, as well as they were able, the discoveries already made; _must_\r\nthere not be _some_ great island or continent to balance all that waste of\r\nwater which they were forced to place on the southern hemisphere? Terra\r\nAustralis, “the Southern Land,” was therefore in a sense discovered before\r\nits discovery, just as the late Sir Roderick Murchison predicted gold\r\nthere before Hargreaves found it.(101)\r\n\r\nIn the year 1606, Pedro Fernando de Quiros started from Peru on a voyage\r\nof discovery to the westward. He found some important islands, to which he\r\ngave the name “Australia del Espiritu Santo,” and which are now believed\r\nto have been part of the New Hebrides group. The vessel of his second in\r\ncommand became separated in consequence of a storm, and by this Luis vas\r\nTorres in consequence reached New Guinea and Australia proper, besides\r\nwhat is now known as Torres Straits, which channel separates them. The\r\nsame year a Dutch vessel coasted about the Gulf of Carpentaria, and it is\r\nto the persistent efforts of the navigators of Holland that the Australian\r\ncoasts became well explored. From 1616, at intervals, till 1644, they\r\ninstigated many voyages, the leading ones of which were the two made by\r\nTasman, in the second of which he circumnavigated Australia. “New Holland”\r\nwas the title long applied to the western part of Australia—sometimes,\r\nindeed, to the whole country.\r\n\r\nThe voyages of the Dutch had not that glamour of romance which so often\r\nattaches to those of the Spanish and English. They did not meet natives\r\nladen with evidences of the natural wealth of their country, and adorned\r\nby barbaric ornaments. On the contrary, the coasts of Australia did not\r\nappear prepossessing, while the natives were wretched and squalid. Could\r\nthey have known of its after-destiny, England might not hold it to-day.\r\nWhen Dampier, sent out by William III. more than fifty years afterwards,\r\nre-discovered the west coast of Australia, he had little to record more\r\nthan the number of sharks on the coast, his astonishment at the kangaroos\r\njumping about on shore, and his disgust for the few natives he met, whom\r\nhe described as “the most unpleasant-looking and worst-featured of any\r\npeople” he had ever encountered.\r\n\r\nNearly seventy years elapsed before any other noteworthy discovery was\r\nmade in regard to Australia. In Captain Cook’s first voyage, in 1768, he\r\nexplored and partially surveyed the eastern part of its coasts, and\r\ndiscovered the inlet, to which a considerable notoriety afterwards clung,\r\nwhich he termed Botany Bay, on account of the luxuriant vegetation of its\r\nshores. Rounding the western side, he proceeded northwards to Torres\r\nStraits, near which, on a small island off the mainland, he took\r\npossession of the whole country, in the name of his sovereign, George\r\nIII., christening it _New South Wales_. It is still called _Possession_\r\nIsland. Captain Cook gave so favourable an account of Botany Bay on his\r\nreturn, that it was determined at once to form a colony, in which convict\r\nlabour should be systematically employed. Accordingly, a fleet of eleven\r\nvessels, under Captain Phillip, left Portsmouth on the 13th of May, 1787,\r\nand after a tedious voyage, reached Botany Bay the following January.\r\n\r\nCaptain Phillip found the bay was not a safe anchorage, and in other\r\nrespects was unsuitable. A few miles to the northward he discovered an\r\ninlet, now named Port Jackson—from the name of the seaman who discovered\r\nit—and which had been overlooked by Cook. The fleet was immediately\r\nremoved thither, the convicts landed, and the British flag raised on the\r\nbanks of Sydney Cove. Of the thousand individuals who formed this first\r\nnucleus of a grand colony, more than three-fourths were convicted\r\noffenders. For some time they were partially dependent on England for\r\nsupplies. It had been arranged that they should not, at first, be left\r\nwithout sufficient provisions. The first ship sent out after the colonists\r\nhad been landed for this purpose was struck by an iceberg in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Cape of Good Hope, and might not have been saved at\r\nall, but for the seamanship of the “gallant, good Riou,” who afterwards\r\nlost his life at the battle of Copenhagen. He managed to keep her afloat,\r\nand she was at length towed into Table Bay, and a portion of her stores\r\nsaved. Meantime, the colonists were living “in the constant belief that\r\nthey should one day perish of hunger.” Governor Phillip set a noble\r\nexample by putting himself on the same rations as the meanest convict; and\r\nwhen on state occasions he was obliged to invite the officers of the\r\ncolony to dine with him at the Government House, he used to intimate to\r\nthe guests that “they must bring their bread along with them.” At last, in\r\nJune, 1790, some stores arrived; and in the following year a second fleet\r\nof vessels came out from England, one ship of the Royal Navy and ten\r\ntransports; 1,763 convicts had left England on board the latter, of whom\r\nnearly 200 died on the voyage, and many more on arrival. The number of\r\nfree settlers was then, and long afterwards, naturally very small; they\r\ndid not like to be so intimately and inevitably associated with convicted\r\ncriminals. In 1810 the total population of Australia was about 10,000. In\r\n1836 it had risen to 77,000, two-fifths of whom were convicts in actual\r\nbondage, while of the remainder, a large proportion had at one time been\r\nin the same condition. Governor King, one of the earlier officials of the\r\ncolony, complained that “he could not make farmers out of pickpockets;”\r\nand Governor Macquarie later said that “there were only two classes of\r\nindividuals in New South Wales—those who had been convicted, and those who\r\nought to have been.” Under these discouraging circumstances, coupled with\r\nall kinds of other difficulties, the colony made slow headway. Droughts\r\nand inundations, famine or scarcity, and hostility on the part of the\r\nnatives, helped seriously to retard its progress. About the period of Sir\r\nThomas Brisbane’s administration, there was an influx of a better class of\r\ncolonists, owing to the inauguration of free emigration. In 1841,\r\ntransportation to New South Wales ceased. Ten years later the discovery of\r\ngold by Mr. E. H. Hargreaves (on the 12th of February, 1851) caused the\r\nfirst great “rush” to the colony, which influx has since continued, partly\r\nfor better reasons than gold-finding—the grand chances offered for\r\nstock-raising, agricultural, horticultural, and vinicultural pursuits.\r\n\r\nTo the north and south of Sydney, the coast is a nearly unbroken range of\r\niron-bound cliffs. But as a vessel approaches the shore, a narrow\r\nentrance, between the two “Heads” of Port Jackson, as they are called,\r\ndiscloses itself. It is nowhere greater than a mile in width, and really\r\ndoes not appear so much, on account of the height of the cliffs. On\r\nentering the harbour a fine sea-lake appears in view, usually blue and\r\ncalm, and in one of its charming inlets is situated the city of Sydney.\r\n“There is not,” writes Professor Hughes, “a more thoroughly English town\r\non the face of the globe—not even in England itself—than this southern\r\nemporium of the commerce of nations. Sydney is entirely wanting in the\r\nnovel and exotic aspect which belongs to foreign capitals. The emigrant\r\nlands there, and hears his own mother tongue spoken on every side; he\r\nlooks around upon the busy life of its crowded streets, and he gazes on\r\nscenes exactly similar to those daily observable in the highways of\r\nLondon, Liverpool, Birmingham, or Manchester.... ‘Were it not,’ says\r\nColonel Mundy, ‘for an occasional orange-tree in full bloom, or fruit in\r\nthe background of some of the older cottages, or a flock of little green\r\nparrots whistling as they alight for a moment on a house-top, one might\r\nfancy himself in Brighton or Plymouth.’”(102) Gay equipages crowd its\r\nstreets, which are lined with handsome shops; the city abounds in fine\r\npublic buildings. In the outskirts of the city are flour-mills of all\r\nkinds, worked by horse, water, wind, and steam; great distilleries and\r\nbreweries, soap and candle works, tanneries, and woollen-mills, at the\r\nlatter of which they turn out an excellent tweed cloth. Ship-building is\r\ncarried on extensively around Port Jackson. Although now overshadowed by\r\nthe commercial superiority of Melbourne, it has the preeminence as a port.\r\nIn fact, Melbourne is not a sea-port at all, as we shall see. Vessels of\r\nlarge burdens can lie alongside the wharves of Sydney, and “Jack,” in the\r\nRoyal Navy at least, is more likely to stop there for awhile, than ever to\r\nsee Melbourne. He will find it a cheap place in most respects, for\r\neverywhere in New South Wales meat is excessively low-priced; they used\r\nformerly to throw it away, after taking off the hides and boiling out the\r\nfat, but are wiser now, and send it in tins all over the world. Such\r\nfruits as the peach, nectarine, apricot, plum, fig, grape, cherry, and\r\norange are as plentiful as blackberries. The orangeries and orchards of\r\nNew South Wales are among its sights; and in the neighbourhood of Sydney\r\nand round Port Jackson there are beautiful groves of orange-trees, which\r\nextend in some places down to the water’s edge. Individual settlers have\r\ngroves which yield as many as thirty thousand dozen oranges per annum. One\r\nmay there literally “sit under his own vine and fig-tree.” If a\r\npeach-stone is thrown down in almost any part of Australia where there is\r\na little moisture, a tree will spring up, which in a few years will yield\r\nhandsomely. A well-known botanist used formerly to carry with him, during\r\nextensive travels, a small bag of peach-stones to plant in suitable\r\nplaces, and many a wandering settler has blessed him since. Pigs were\r\nformerly often fed on peaches, as was done in California, a country much\r\nresembling Southern Australia; it is only of late years they have been\r\nutilised in both places by drying or otherwise preserving. A basket-load\r\nmay be obtained in the Sydney markets during the season for a few pence.\r\nThe summer heat of Sydney is about that of Naples, while its winter\r\ncorresponds with that of Sicily.\r\n\r\nBut are there no drawbacks to all this happy state of things? Well, yes;\r\nabout the worst is a hot blast which sometimes blows from the interior,\r\nknown popularly in Sydney as a “brick-fielder” or “southerly buster.” It\r\nis much like that already described, and neither the most closely-fastened\r\ndoors nor windows will keep out the fearful dust-storm. “Its effect,” says\r\nProfessor Hughes, “is particularly destructive of every sense of comfort;\r\nthe dried and dust-besprinkled skin acquiring for the time some\r\nresemblance to parchment, and the hair feeling more like hay than any\r\nsofter material.”\r\n\r\nShould Jack or his superior officers land during the heat of autumn, he\r\nmay have the opportunity of passing a novel Christmas—very completely\r\nun-English. The gayest and brightest flowers will be in bloom, and the\r\nmusquitoes out in full force. “Sitting,” says a writer, “in a thorough\r\ndraught, clad in a holland blouse, you may see men and boys dragging from\r\nthe neighbouring bush piles of green stuff (oak-branches in full leaf and\r\nacorn, and a handsome shrub with a pink flower and pale green leaf—the\r\n‘Christmas’ of Australia) for the decoration of churches and dwellings,\r\nand stopping every fifty yards to wipe their perspiring brows.”\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Sydney, the grand park, called “The Domain,” which\r\nstretches down to the blue water in the picturesque indentations around\r\nPort Jackson, must be mentioned. It contains several hundred acres,\r\ntastefully laid out in drives, and with public walks cut through the\r\nindigenous or planted shrubberies, and amidst the richest woodland\r\nscenery, or winding at the edge of the rocky bluffs or by the margin of\r\nthe glittering waters. Adjoining this lovely spot is one of the finest\r\nbotanic gardens in the world, considered by all Sydney to be a veritable\r\nEden.\r\n\r\nPort Phillip, like Port Jackson, is entered by a narrow passage, and\r\nimmediately inside is a magnificent basin, thirty miles across in almost\r\nany direction. It is so securely sheltered that it affords an admirable\r\nanchorage for shipping. Otherwise, Melbourne, now a grand city with a\r\npopulation of about 300,000, would have had little chance of attaining its\r\ngreat commercial superiority over any city of Australia. Melbourne is\r\nsituated about eight miles up the Yarra-Yarra (“flowing-flowing”) river,\r\nwhich flows into the head of Port Phillip. That poetically-named, but\r\nreally lazy, muddy stream is only navigable for vessels of very small\r\ndraught. But Melbourne has a fine country to back it. Many of the old and\r\nrich mining-districts were round Port Phillip, or on and about streams\r\nflowing into it. Wheat, maize, potatoes, vegetables and fruits in general,\r\nare greatly cultivated; and the colony of Victoria is pre-eminent for\r\nsheep-farming and cattle-runs, and the industries connected with wool,\r\nhides, tallow, and, of late, meat, which they bring forth. Melbourne\r\nitself lies rather low, and its original site, now entirely filled in, was\r\nswampy. Hence came occasional epidemics—dysentery, influenza, and so\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: A TIMBER WHARF AT SAN FRANCISCO.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ROUND THE WORLD ON A MAN-OF-WAR (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE PACIFIC STATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Across the Pacific—Approach to the Golden Gate—The Bay of San\r\n    Francisco—The City—First Dinner Ashore—Cheap Luxury—San Francisco\r\n      by Night—The Land of Gold, Grain, and Grapes—Incidents of the\r\n      Early Days—Expensive Papers—A Lucky Sailor—Chances for English\r\n     Girls—The Baby at the Play—A capital Port for Seamen—Hospitality\r\n     of Californians—Victoria, Vancouver Island—The Naval Station at\r\n    Esquimalt—A Delightful Place—Advice to Intending Emigrants—British\r\n    Columbian Indians—Their fine Canoes—Experiences of the Writer—The\r\n    Island on Fire—The Chinook Jargon—Indian “Pigeon-English”—North to\r\n           Alaska—The Purchase of Russian America by the United\r\n       States—Results—Life at Sitka—Grand Volcanoes of the Aleutian\r\n    Islands—The Great Yukon River—American Trading Posts round Bering\r\n                                   Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nA common course for a vessel crossing the Pacific would be from Australia\r\nor New Zealand to San Francisco, California. The mail-steamers follow this\r\nroute, touching at the Fiji and Hawaiian groups of islands; and the sailor\r\nin the Royal Navy is as likely to find this route the orders of his\r\ncommander as any other. If the writer, in describing the country he knows\r\nbetter than any other, be found somewhat enthusiastic and gushing, he will\r\nat least give reasons for his warmth. On this subject, above all others,\r\nhe writes _con amore_. He spent over twelve years on the Pacific coasts of\r\nAmerica, and out of that time about seven in the Golden State, California.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, “See Naples, and die!” The reader is recommended to see\r\nthe glorious Bay of San Francisco before he makes up his mind that there\r\nis nought else worthy of note, because he has sailed on the blue waters of\r\nthe most beautiful of the Mediterranean bays. How well does the writer\r\nremember his first sight of the Golden Gate, as the entrance to San\r\nFrancisco Bay is poetically named! The good steamer on which he had spent\r\nsome seventy-five days—which had passed over nearly the entire Atlantic,\r\nweathered the Horn, and then, with the favouring “trade-winds,” had sailed\r\nand steamed up the Pacific with one grand sweep to California, out of\r\nsight of land the whole time—was sadly in want of coals when she arrived\r\noff that coast, which a dense fog entirely hid from view. The engines were\r\nkept going slowly by means of any stray wood on board; valuable spars were\r\nsacrificed, and it was even proposed to strip the woodwork out of the\r\nsteerage, which contained about two hundred men, women, and children. Guns\r\nand rockets were fired, but at first with no result, and the prospect was\r\nnot cheering. But at last the welcome little pilot-boat loomed through the\r\nfog, and was soon alongside, and a healthy, jovial-looking pilot came\r\naboard. “You can all have a good dinner to-night ashore,” said that\r\nexcellent seaman to the passengers, “and the sea shan’t rob you of it.”\r\nThe fog lifted as the vessel slowly steamed onwards.\r\n\r\nOn approaching the entrance to the bay, on the right cliffs and rocks are\r\nseen, with a splendid beach, where carriages and buggies are constantly\r\npassing and repassing. On the top of a rocky bluff, the Seal Rock or\r\n“Cliff” House, a popular hotel; below it, in the sea, a couple or so of\r\nrocky islets covered with sea-lions, which are protected by a law of the\r\nState. To the left, outside some miles, the Farralone Islands, with a\r\ncapital lighthouse perched on the top of one of them. Entering the Golden\r\nGate, and looking to the right again, the Fort Point Barracks and the\r\noutskirts of the city; to the left the many-coloured headlands and cliffs,\r\non whose summits the wild oats are pale and golden in the bright sunlight.\r\nBefore one, several islands—Alcatraz, bristling with guns, and covered\r\nwith fortifications; Goat Island, presumably so called because on it there\r\nare no goats. Beyond, fifty miles of green water, and a forest of\r\nshipping; and a city, the history of which has no parallel on earth. Hills\r\nbehind, with streets as steep as those of Malta; high land, with spires,\r\nand towers, and fine edifices innumerable; and great wharves, and slips,\r\nand docks in front of all; with steamships and steam ferry-boats\r\nconstantly arriving and departing. And now the vessel anchors in the\r\nstream, and if not caring to haggle over the half-dollar—a large sum in\r\nEnglish ears—which the boatman demands from each passenger who wishes to\r\ngo ashore, the traveller finds himself in a strange land, and amid a\r\npeople of whom he will learn to form the very highest estimate.\r\n\r\nThat first dinner, after the eternal bean-coffee, boiled tea, tinned\r\nmeats, dried vegetables, and “salt horse” of one’s ship, in a neat\r\n_restaurant_, where it seems everything on earth can be obtained, will\r\nsurprise most visitors. An irreproachable _potage_: broiled salmon (the\r\nfish is a drug, almost, on the Pacific coasts); turtle steaks, oyster\r\nplant, artichokes, and green corn; a California quail “on toast;” grand\r\nmuscatel grapes, green figs, and a cooling slice of melon; Roquefort\r\ncheese, or a very good imitation of it; black coffee, and cigars; native\r\nwine on the table; California cognac on demand; service excellent—napkins,\r\nhot plates, flowers on the table; price moderate for the luxuries\r\nobtained, and _no waiter’s fees_. The visitor will mentally forgive the\r\nboatman of the morning. Has he arrived in the Promised Land, in the\r\nParadise of _bon vivants_? It seems so. In the evening, he may take a\r\nstroll up Montgomery Street, and a good seat at a creditably performed\r\nopera may be obtained. Nobody knows better than the sailor and the\r\ntraveller the splendid luxury of such moments, after a two or three\r\nmonths’ monotonous voyage. And, in good sooth, he generally abandons\r\nhimself to it. He has earned it, and who shall say him nay? The same\r\nevening may be, he will go to a 300-roomed hotel—they have now one of 750\r\nrooms—where, for three dollars (12s. 6d.), he can sup, sleep, breakfast,\r\nand dine sumptuously. He will be answered twenty questions for nothing by\r\na civil clerk in the office of the hotel, read the papers for nothing in\r\nthe reading-room, have a bath—for nothing—and find that it is not the\r\nthing to give fees to the waiters. It is a new revelation to many who have\r\nstopped before in dozens of first-class English and Continental houses.\r\n\r\n“Seen,” says Mr. W. F. Rae,(103) “as I saw it for the first time, the\r\nappearance of San Francisco is enchanting. Built on a hill-slope, up which\r\nmany streets run to the top, and illumined as many of these streets were\r\nwith innumerable gas-lamps, the effect was that of a huge dome ablaze with\r\nlamps arranged in lines and circles. Those who have stood in Princes\r\nStreet at night, and gazed upon the Old Town and Castle of Edinburgh, can\r\nform a very correct notion of the fairy-like spectacle. Expecting to find\r\nSan Francisco a city of wonders, I was not disappointed when it seemed to\r\nmy eyes a city of magic—such a city as Aladdin might have ordered the\r\ngenii to create in order to astonish and dazzle the spectator. I was\r\nwarned by those whom personal experience of the city had taught to\r\ndistinguish glitter from substance, not to expect that the reality of the\r\nmorrow would fulfil the promise of the evening. Some of the parts which\r\nnow appeared the most fascinating were said to be the least attractive\r\nwhen viewed by day. Still, the panorama was deprived of none of its\r\nglories by these whispers of well-meant warning.” The present writer has\r\ncrossed the Bay in the ferry and other boats a hundred times, and on a\r\nfine night—and they have about nine months of fine nights in California—he\r\nnever missed the opportunity of going forward towards the bows of the boat\r\nwhen it approached San Francisco. As Mr. Rae writes, “The full-orbed stars\r\ntwinkling overhead are almost rivalled by the myriads of gas-lights\r\nilluminating the land.” Less than thirty years ago this city of 300,000\r\nsouls was but a mission-village, and the few inhabitants of California\r\nwere mostly demoralised Mexicans, lazy half-breeds, and wretched Indians,\r\nwho could almost live without work, and, as a rule, did so. Wild cattle\r\nroamed at will, and meat was to be had for the asking. The only ships\r\nwhich arrived were like the brig _Pilgrim_, described by Dana in “Two\r\nYears before the Mast,” bound to California for hides and tallow. Now, the\r\ntonnage of the shipping of all nations which enters the port of San\r\nFrancisco is enormous. The discovery made by Marshall, in 1847, _first_\r\nbrought about the revolution. “Such is the power of gold.” _Now_,\r\nCalifornia depends far more on her corn, and wool, and hides, her wine,\r\nher grapes, oranges, and other fruits, and on innumerable industries.\r\nReader, you have eaten bread made from California wheat—it fetches a high\r\nprice in Liverpool on account of its fine quality; you may have been\r\nclothed in California wool, and your boots made of her leather; more than\r\nlikely you have drunk California wine, of which large quantities are\r\nshipped to Hamburgh, where they are watered and doctored for the rest of\r\nEurope, and exported under French and German names; your head may have\r\nbeen shampooed with California borax; and your watch-chain was probably,\r\nand some of your coin assuredly, made from the gold of the Golden State.\r\n\r\nThis is not a book on “The Land,” but two or three stories of Californian\r\nlife in the early days may, however, be forgiven. The first is of a man\r\nwho had just landed from a ship, and who offered a somewhat seedy-looking\r\ncustomer, lounging on the wharf, a dollar to carry his portmanteau. He got\r\nthe reply, “I’ll give you an ounce of gold to see you carry it yourself.”\r\nThe new arrival thought he had come to a splendid country, and shouldered\r\nhis burden like a man, when the other, a successful gold-finder, not\r\nmerely gave him his ounce—little less than £4 sterling—but treated him to\r\na bottle of champagne, which cost another ounce. The writer can well\r\nbelieve the story, for he paid two and a half dollars—nearly half a\r\nguinea—for an _Illustrated London News_, and two dollars for a copy of\r\n_Punch_, in the Cariboo mines, in 1863; while a friend—now retired on a\r\ncompetency in England—started a little weekly newspaper, the size of a\r\nsheet of foolscap, selling it for one dollar (4s. 2d.) per copy. He was\r\nfortunately not merely a competent writer, but a practical printer. He\r\ncomposed his articles on paper first, and then in type; worked the press,\r\ndelivered them to his subscribers, collected advertisements and payments,\r\nand no doubt would have made his own paper—if rags had not been too\r\ncostly!\r\n\r\nA sailor purchased, about the year 1849, in an auction-room, while out on\r\na “spree,” the lots of land on which the Plaza, one of the most important\r\nbusiness squares of San Francisco, now stands. He went off again, and\r\nafter several years cruising about the world, returned to find himself a\r\nmillionaire. The City Hall stands on that property; it is surrounded by\r\noffices, shops, and hotels, and very prettily planted with shrubs,\r\ngrass-plots, and flowers.\r\n\r\nThere was a period when females were so scarce in California that the\r\nminers and farm-hands, ay, and farmers and proprietors too—a large number\r\nof these were old sailors—would travel any distance merely to see\r\none.(104) At this present time any decent English housemaid receives\r\ntwenty dollars (£4) per month, and is “found,” while a superior servant, a\r\nfirst-class cook, or competent housekeeper, gets anything from thirty\r\ndollars upwards.\r\n\r\nTheatres at San Francisco were once rude buildings of boards and canvas,\r\nand the stalls were benches. A story is told that at a performance at such\r\na house quite a commotion was caused by the piercing squall of a healthy\r\nbaby—brought in by a mother who, perhaps, had not had any amusement for a\r\nyear or two, and most assuredly had no servant with whom to leave it at\r\nhome—which was heard above the music. “Here, you fiddlers,” roared out a\r\nstalwart man in a red shirt and “gum” boots, just down from the mines,\r\n“stop that tune; I haven’t heard a baby cry for several years; it does me\r\ngood to hear it.” The “one touch of nature” made that rough audience akin,\r\nand all rose to their feet, cheering the baby, and insisting that the\r\norchestra must stop, and stop it did until the child was quieted. Then a\r\ncollection was made—not of coppers and small silver, but of ounces and\r\ndollars—to present the child with something handsome as a souvenir of its\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: THE BAY OF SAN FRANCISCO.]\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, as the most important commercial emporium and port of the\r\nwhole Pacific, has a particular interest to the “man of the sea.” It has\r\nsocieties, “homes,” and bethels for his benefit, and a fine marine\r\nhospital. At the Merchants’ Exchange he will find the latest shipping-news\r\nand quotations, while many public institutions are open to him, as to all\r\nothers. Above all, he will find one of the most conscientious and kind, as\r\nwell as influential, of British Consuls there—and how often the sailor\r\nabroad may need his interference, only the sailor and merchant knows—who\r\nis also one of the oldest in H.B.M. consular service. No matter his sect,\r\nit is represented; San Francisco is full of churches and chapels. If he\r\nneeds instruction and literary entertainment, he will get it at the\r\nsplendid Mercantile Library, or admirably-conducted Mechanics’ Institute.\r\nThere is a capital “Art Association,” with hundreds of members. He will\r\nfind journalism of a new type: “live,” vigorous, generous, and\r\nsemi-occasionally vicious. The papers of San Francisco will, however,\r\ncompare favourably with those of any other American city, short of New\r\nYork and Boston. The sailor will find the city as advanced in all matters\r\npertaining to modern civilisation, whether good or bad, as any he has ever\r\nvisited. The naval officer will find admirable clubs, and if of the Royal\r\nNavy will most assuredly be put on the books of one or more of them for\r\nthe period of his stay. He will find, too, that San Francisco hospitality\r\nis unbounded, that balls and parties are nowhere better carried out, and\r\nthat the rising generation of California girls are extremely good-looking,\r\nand that the men are stalwart, fine-looking fellows, very unlike the\r\ntypical bony Yankee, who, by-the-by, is getting very scarce even in his\r\nown part of the country, the New England States.\r\n\r\nIf Jack has been to China, he will recognise the truth of the fact that\r\nparts of San Francisco are Chinese as Hong Kong itself. There are\r\nJoss-houses, with a big, stolid-looking idol sitting in state, the temple\r\ngay with tinsel and china, metal-work and paint, smelling faintly of\r\nincense, and strongly of burnt paper. There are Chinese _restaurants_ by\r\nthe dozen, from the high-class dining-rooms, with balconies, flowers,\r\nsmall banners and inscriptions, down to the itinerant _restaurateur_ with\r\nhis charcoal-stove and soup-pot. Then there are Chinese theatres, smelling\r\nstrongly of opium and tobacco, where the orchestra sits at the back of the\r\nstage, which is curtainless and devoid of scenery. The dresses of the\r\nperformers are gorgeous in the extreme. When any new arrangement of\r\nproperties, &c., is required on the stage, the changes are made before\r\nyour eyes; as, for example, placing a table to represent a raised balcony,\r\nor piling up some boxes to form a castle, and so forth. Their dramas are\r\noften almost interminable, for they take the reign of an emperor, for\r\nexample, and play it through, night after night, from his birth to his\r\ndeath. In details they are very literal, and hold “the mirror up to\r\nnature” fully. If the said emperor had special vices, they are displayed\r\non the stage. The music is, to European ears, fearful and wonderful—a\r\nmixture of discordant sounds, resembling those of ungreased cart-wheels\r\nand railway-whistles, mingled with the rolling of drums and striking of\r\ngongs. Some of the streets are lined with Chinese shops, ranging from\r\nthose of the merchants in tea, silks, porcelain, and lacquered ware—a\r\ndignified and polite class of men, who are often highly educated, and\r\nspeak English extremely well—to those of the cigar-makers, barbers,\r\nshoemakers, and laundry-_men_. Half the laundry-work in San Francisco is\r\nperformed by John Chinaman. There is one Chinese hotel or caravanserai,\r\nwhich looks as though it might at a stretch accommodate two hundred\r\npeople, in which 1,200 men are packed.\r\n\r\nThe historian of the future will watch with interest the advancing or\r\nreceding waves of population as they move over the surface of the globe,\r\nnow surging in great waves of resistless force, now peacefully subsiding,\r\nleaving hardly a trace behind. The Pacific Mail Steamship Company’s\r\nsteamers have brought from China to San Francisco as many as 1,200\r\nChinamen—and, very occasionally, of course, more than that number—on a\r\nsingle trip. The lowest estimate of the number of Chinese in California is\r\n70,000, while they are spread all over the Pacific states and territories,\r\nand, indeed, in lesser numbers, all over the American continent. One finds\r\nthem in New England factories, New York laundries, and Southern\r\nplantations. Their reception in San Francisco used to be with brickbats\r\nand other missiles, and hooting and jeering, on the part of the lower\r\nclasses of the community. This is not the place to enter into a discussion\r\non the political side of the question. Suffice it to say that they were\r\nand still are a necessity in California, where the expense of reaching the\r\ncountry has kept out “white” labour to an extent so considerable, that it\r\nstill rules higher than in almost any part of the world. The respectable\r\nmiddle classes would hardly afford servants at all were it not for the\r\nChinese. All the better classes support their claims to full legal and\r\nsocial rights. The Chinamen who come to San Francisco are not coolies, and\r\na large number of them pay their own passages over. When brought over by\r\nmerchants, or one of the six great Chinese companies, their passage-money\r\nis advanced, and they, of course, pay interest for the accommodation. On\r\narrival in California, if they do not immediately go to work, they proceed\r\nto the “Company-house” of their particular province, where, in a kind of\r\ncaravanserai, rough accommodations for sleeping and cooking are afforded.\r\nHardly a better system of organisation could be adopted than that of the\r\ncompanies, who know exactly where each man in their debt is to be found,\r\nif he is hundreds of miles from San Francisco. Were it possible to adopt\r\nthe same system in regard to emigrants from this country, thousands would\r\nbe glad to avail themselves of the opportunity of proceeding to the Golden\r\nState.\r\n\r\nOne little anecdote, and the Chinese must be left to their fate. It\r\nhappened in 1869. Two Chinese merchants had been invited by one of the\r\nheads of a leading steamship company to visit the theatre, where they had\r\ntaken a box. The merchants, men of high standing among their countrymen,\r\naccepted. Their appearance in front of it was the signal for an outburst\r\nof ruffianism on the part of the gallery; it was the “gods” _versus_ the\r\ncelestials, and for a time the former had it all their own way. In vain\r\nLawrence Barrett, the actor, came forward on the stage to try and appease\r\nthem. He is supposed to have said that any well-conducted person had a\r\nright to his seat in the house. An excited gentleman in the dress-circle\r\nreiterated the same ideas, and was rewarded by a torrent of hisses and\r\ncaterwauling. The Chinamen, alarmed that it might result in violence to\r\nthem, would have retired, but a dozen gentlemen from the dress-circle and\r\norchestra seats requested them to stay, promising them protection, and the\r\nmerchants remained. They could see that all the better and more\r\nrespectable part of the house wished them to remain. After twenty or more\r\nminutes of interruption, the gallery was nearly cleared by the police, and\r\nthe performance allowed to proceed. And yet the very class who are so\r\nopposed to the Caucasian complain that he does not spend his money in the\r\ncountry where he makes it, but hoards it up for China. The story explains\r\nthe actual position of the Chinaman in America to-day. The upper and\r\nmiddle classes, ay, and the honest mechanics who require their assistance,\r\nsupport their claims; the lowest scum of the population persecute, injure,\r\nand not unfrequently murder them. Many a poor John Chinaman has, as they\r\nsay in America, been “found missing.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor ashore in San Francisco may likely enough have an opportunity\r\nof feeling the tremor of an earthquake. As a rule, they have been\r\nexceedingly slight, but that of the 21st October, 1868, was a serious\r\naffair. Towers and steeples swayed to and fro: tall houses trembled,\r\nbadly-built wooden houses became disjointed; walls fell. Many buildings,\r\nfor some time afterwards, showed the effects in cracked walls and\r\nplastering, dislocated doors and window-frames. A writer in the _Overland\r\nMonthly_, soon after the event, put the matter forcibly when recalling the\r\ngreat earthquake of Lisbon. He said, “Over the parts of the city where\r\nships anchored twenty years ago, they may anchor again,” for the worst\r\neffects were confined to the “made” ground—_i.e._, land reclaimed from the\r\nBay. Dwellings on the rocky hills were scarcely injured at all, reminding\r\nus of the relative fates of the man “who built his house upon a rock” and\r\nof him who placed it on the sand. Four persons only were killed on that\r\noccasion, all of them from the fall of badly-constructed walls, loose\r\nparapets, &c. The alarm in the city was great; excited people rushing\r\nwildly through the streets, and frightened horses running through the\r\ncrowds.\r\n\r\nCalifornia possesses other ports of importance, but as regards English\r\nnaval interests in the Pacific, Esquimalt, Vancouver Island, B.C., which\r\nhas a fine land-locked harbour of deep water, dock, and naval hospital,\r\ndeserves the notice of the reader. It is often the rendezvous for seven or\r\neight of H.M.’s vessels, from the admiral’s flag-ship to the tiniest steam\r\ngun-boat. Victoria, the capital, is three miles off, and has a pretty\r\nlittle harbour itself, not, however, adapted for large vessels. Formerly\r\nthe colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia, the mainland, were\r\nseparate and distinct colonies; they are now identified under the latter\r\nname. Their value never warranted the full paraphernalia of a double\r\ncolonial government—two governors, colonial secretaries, treasurers,\r\nattorney-generals, &c., &c.; for these countries, charming and interesting\r\nto the tourist and artist, will only attract population slowly. The\r\nresources of British Columbia in gold, timber, coal, fisheries, &c., are\r\nconsiderable; but the long winters on the mainland, and the small quantity\r\nof open land, are great drawbacks. Approaching Vancouver Island from the\r\nsea, the “inside channel” is entered through the grand opening to the\r\nStraits of Fuca, which Cook missed and Vancouver discovered. To the\r\neastward are the rocks and light of Cape Flattery, while the rather low\r\ntermination of Vancouver Island, thick with timber, is seen to the\r\nwestward. The scene in the Straits is often lively with steamers and\r\nshipping, great men-of-war, sometimes of foreign nationalities; coast\r\npacket-boats proceeding not merely to Vancouver Island, but to the ports\r\nof Washington Territory, on the American side; timber (called “lumber”\r\nalways on that side of the world) vessels; colliers proceeding to Nanaimo\r\nor Bellingham Bay to the coal-mines; coasting and trading schooners; and\r\nIndian canoes, some of them big enough to accommodate sixty or more\r\npersons, and carrying a good amount of sail. The Straits have many\r\nbeauties; and as, approaching the entrance of Esquimalt Harbour, the\r\nOlympian range of mountains, snow-covered and rugged, loom in the\r\ndistance, the scene is grandly beautiful; while in the channel, rocky\r\nislets and islands, covered with pine and arbutus, abound. Outside the\r\nStraits two lighthouses are placed, to warn the unwary voyager by night.\r\nOften those lighthouses may be noted apparently upside down! Mirage is\r\ncommon enough in the Straits of Fuca.\r\n\r\nVictoria, in 1862, had at least 12,000 or 15,000 people, mostly drawn\r\nthither by the fame of the Cariboo mines, on the mainland of British\r\nColumbia. Not twenty per cent. ever reached those mines. When ships\r\narrived in the autumn, it was utterly useless to attempt the long journey\r\nof about 600 miles, partly by steamer, but two-thirds of which must be\r\naccomplished on foot or horseback, or often mule-back, over rugged\r\nmountain-paths, through swamps and forests. Consequently, a large number\r\nhad to spend the winter in idleness; and in the spring, in many cases,\r\ntheir resources were exhausted. Many became tired of the colony; “roughing\r\nit” was not always the pleasant kind of thing they had imagined, and so\r\nthey went down to California, or left for home. Others were stuck fast in\r\nthe colony, and many suffered severe privations; although, so long as they\r\ncould manage to live on salmon alone, they could obtain plenty from the\r\nIndians, who hawked it about the streets for a shilling or two shillings\r\napiece—the latter for a very large fish. The son of a baronet at one time\r\nmight be seen breaking stones for a living in Victoria; and unless men had\r\na very distinct calling, profession, or trade, they had to live on their\r\nmeans or have a very rough time of it.\r\n\r\nThese remarks are not made to deter adventurous spirits from going abroad;\r\nbut we would advise them to “look well before they leap.” But how utterly\r\nunfitted for mining-work were the larger part of the young men who had\r\ntravelled so far, only to be disappointed. There was no doubt of the gold\r\nbeing there: two hundred ounces of the precious metal have been “washed\r\nout” in an eight hours’ “shift” (a “shift” is the same as a “watch” on\r\nboard ship); and this was kept up for many days in succession, the miners\r\nworking day and night. But that mine had been three years in process of\r\ndevelopment, and only one of the original proprietors was among the lucky\r\nnumber of shareholders. A day or so before the first gold had been\r\nfound—“struck” is the technical expression—his credit was exhausted, and\r\nhe had begged vainly for flour, &c., to enable him to live and work. The\r\nordinary price of a very ordinary meal was _two dollars_; and it will be\r\nseen that, unless employed, or simply travelling for pleasure, it was a\r\nruinous place to stop in. Fancy, then, the condition of perhaps as many as\r\n4,000 unemployed men, out of a total of 7,000 men, on the various creeks,\r\na good half of whom were of the middle and upper classes at home. But for\r\none happy fact, that beef—which, as the miners said, _packed itself_ into\r\nthe mines (in other words, the cattle were driven in from a distance of\r\nhundreds of miles)—was reasonably cheap, hundreds of them must have\r\nstarved. Everything—from flour, tea, sugar, bacon, and beans, to metal\r\nimplements and machinery—had to be packed there on the backs of mules, and\r\ncost from fifty cents and upwards per pound for the mere cost of\r\ntransportation. Tea was ten shillings a pound, flour and sugar a dollar a\r\npound, and so on. Those who fancy that gold-mining, and especially deep\r\ngravel-mining, as in Cariboo, is play-work, may be told that it is perhaps\r\nthe hardest, as it is certainly the most risky and uncertain, work in the\r\nworld; and that it requires machinery, expensive tools, &c., which, in\r\nplaces like Cariboo, cost enormous sums to supply. If labour was to be\r\nemployed—good practical miners, carpenters, &c. (much of the machinery was\r\nof wood)—received, at that period, ten to sixteen dollars per day. This\r\ndigression may be pardoned, as the sea is so intimately bound up with\r\nquestions of emigration. Apart from this, from personal observation, the\r\nwriter knows that quite a proportion of miners have been sailors, and, in\r\nmany cases, deserted their ships. In the “early days” of Australia,\r\nCalifornia, and British Columbia, this was eminently the case.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the sailors in the Royal Navy have, or will at some\r\nperiod, pass some time on the Pacific station, in which case, they will\r\ninevitably go to Vancouver Island, where there is much to interest\r\nthem.(105) They will find Victoria a very pretty little town, with\r\nGovernment house, cathedral, churches and chapels, a mechanics’ institute,\r\na theatre, good hotels and restaurants—the latter generally in French\r\nhands. He will find a curious mixture of English and American manners and\r\ncustoms, and a very curious mixture of coinage—shillings being the same as\r\nquarter-dollars, while crowns are only the value of dollars (5s., against\r\n4s. 2d.). Some years ago the island system was different from that of the\r\nmainland; on the latter, florins were equal to half-dollars (which they\r\nare, nearly), while on the island they were 37½ cents only (1s. 7½d.). The\r\nHudson’s Bay Company, which has trading-posts throughout British Columbia,\r\ntook advantage of the fact to give change for American money, on their\r\nsteamers, in English florins, obtaining them on the island. They thus made\r\nnearly twenty-five per cent. in their transaction, besides getting paid\r\nthe passenger’s fare. Yet the traveller, strange to say, did not lose by\r\nthis, for, on landing at New Westminster, he found that what was rated at\r\na little over eighteenpence on Vancouver Island, had suddenly, after\r\ntravelling only seventy miles or so, increased in value to upwards of two\r\nshillings!\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: THE BRITISH CAMP: SAN JUAN.]\r\n\r\nOutside Victoria there are many pleasant drives and walks: to “The Arm,”\r\nwhere, amid a charming landscape, interspersed with pines and natural fir\r\nwoods, wild flowers, and mossy rocks, there is a pretty little rapid, or\r\nfall; to Saanich, where the settlers’ homesteads have a semi-civilised\r\nappearance, half of the houses being of squared logs, but comfortable\r\nwithal inside, and where a rude plenty reigns; or to Beacon Hill, where\r\nthere is an excellent race-course and drive, which commands fine views up\r\nand down the Straits. In sight is San Juan Island, over which England and\r\nAmerica once squabbled, while the two garrisons which occupied it\r\nfraternised cordially, and outvied with each other in hospitality. The\r\nisland—rocky, and covered with forest and underbrush, with a farm or two,\r\nmade by clearing away the big trees, with not a little difficulty, and\r\nburning and partially uprooting the stumps—does not look a worthy subject\r\nfor international differences. But the fact is, that it commands the\r\nStraits to some extent. However, all that is over now, and it is England’s\r\nproperty by diplomatic arrangement. There are other islands, nearly as\r\nlarge, in the archipelago which stretches northward up the Gulf of\r\nGeorgia, which have not a single human inhabitant, and have never been\r\nvisited, except by some stray Indians, miners, or traders who have gone\r\nashore to cook a meal or camp for the night.\r\n\r\nAny one who has travelled by small canoes on the sea must remember those\r\nhappy camping-times, when, often wet, and always hungry and tired, the\r\nlittle party cautiously selected some sheltered nook or specially good\r\nbeach, and then paddled with a will ashore. No lack of drift-wood or small\r\ntrees on that coast, and no lord of the manor to interfere with one taking\r\nit. A glorious fire is soon raised, and the cooking preparations\r\ncommenced. Sometimes it is only the stereotyped tea—frying-pan bread\r\n(something like the Australian “damper,” only baked before the fire), or\r\n“slapjacks” (_i.e._, flour-and-water pancakes), fried bacon, and boiled\r\nChili beans; but ofttimes it can be varied by excellent fish, game,\r\nbear-meat, venison, or moose-meat, purchased from some passing Indians, or\r\nkilled by themselves. It is absurd to suppose that “roughing it” need mean\r\nhardship and semi-starvation all the time. Not a bit of it! On the\r\nnorthern coasts now being described, one may often live magnificently, and\r\nmost travellers learn instinctively to cook, and make the most of things.\r\nNothing is finer in camp than a _roast_ fish—say a salmon—split and\r\ngutted, and stuck on a stick before the fire, not over it. A few dozen\r\nturns, and you have a dish worthy of a prince. Or a composition stew—say\r\nof deer and bear-meat and beaver’s tail, well seasoned, and with such\r\nvegetables as you may obtain there; potatoes from some seaside farm—and\r\nthere are such on that coast, where the settler is as brown as his Indian\r\nwife—or compressed vegetables, often taken on exploring expeditions. Or,\r\nagain, venison dipped in a thick batter and thrown into a pan of\r\nboiling-hot fat, making a kind of meat fritter, with not a drop of its\r\njuices wasted. Some of these explorers and miners are veritable _chefs_.\r\nThey can make good light bread in the woods from plain flour, water, and\r\nsalt, and ask no oven but a frying-pan. They will make beans, of a kind\r\nonly given to horses at home, into a delicious dish, by boiling them\r\nsoft—a long job, generally done at the night camp—and then frying them\r\nwith bread-crumbs and pieces of bacon in the morning, till they are brown\r\nand crisp.\r\n\r\nIt was at one of these camps, on an island in the Gulf of Georgia, that a\r\ncamp fire spread to some grass and underbrush, mounted with lightning\r\nrapidity a steep slope, and in a few minutes the forest at the top was\r\nablaze. The whole island was soon in flames! For hours afterwards the\r\nflames and smoke could be seen. No harm was done; for it is extremely\r\nunlikely that island will be inhabited for the next five hundred years.\r\nBut forest fires in partially inhabited districts are more serious, or\r\nwhen near trails or roads. In the long summer of Vancouver Island, where\r\nrain, as in California, is almost unknown, these fires, once started, may\r\nburn for weeks—ay, months.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of this part of the coast, of dozens of petty tribes, all\r\nspeaking different languages, or, at all events, varied dialects, are not\r\nusually prepossessing in appearance, but the male half-breeds are often\r\nfine-looking fellows, and the girls pretty. The sailor will be interested\r\nin their cedar canoes, which on Vancouver Island are beautifully modelled.\r\nA first-class clipper has not more graceful lines. They are always cut\r\nfrom one log, and are finely and smoothly finished, being usually painted\r\nblack outside, and finished with red ornamental work within. They are very\r\nlight and buoyant, and will carry great weights; but one must be careful\r\nto avoid rocks on the coast, or “snags” in the rivers, for any sudden\r\nconcussion will split them all to pieces. When on the Vancouver Island\r\nExploring Expedition, a party of men found themselves suddenly deposited\r\nin a swift-running stream, from the canoe having almost parted in half,\r\nafter touching on a sunken rock or log. All got to shore safely, and it\r\ntook about half a day of patching and caulking to make her sufficiently\r\nriver-worthy (why not say “river-worthy” as well as “sea-worthy?”) to\r\nenable them to reach camp. The writer, in 1864, came down from the extreme\r\nend of Bute Inlet—an arm of the sea on the mainland of British\r\nColumbia—across the Gulf of Georgia (twenty miles of open sea), coasting\r\nsouthwards to Victoria, V.I., the total voyage being 180 miles, in an open\r\ncedar canoe, only large enough for four or five people. The trip occupied\r\nfive days. But while there is some risk in such an undertaking, there is\r\nlittle in a voyage in the great Haidah canoes of Queen Charlotte’s Island\r\n(north of Vancouver Island). These canoes are often eighty feet long, but\r\nare still always made from a single log, the splendid pines of that\r\ncoast(106) affording ample opportunity. They have masts, and carry as much\r\nsail as a schooner, while they can be propelled by, say, forty or fifty\r\npaddles, half on either side, wielded by as many pairs of brawny arms. The\r\nsavage Haidahs are a powerful race, of whom not much is known. They,\r\nhowever, often come to Victoria, or the American ports on Puget Sound, for\r\npurposes of trading.\r\n\r\n“How,” it might be asked, “does the trade communicate with so many\r\nvarieties of natives, all speaking different tongues?” The answer is that\r\nthere is a jargon, a kind of “pigeon-English,” which is acquired, more or\r\nless, by almost all residents on the coast for purposes of intercourse\r\nwith their Indian servants or others. This is the Chinook jargon, a\r\nmixture of Indian, English, and French—the latter coming from the French\r\nCanadian _voyageurs_, often to be found in the employ of the Hudson’s Bay\r\nCompany, as they were formerly in the defunct North-West Company. Some of\r\nthe words used have curious origins. Thus, an Englishman is a\r\n“King-George-man,” because the first explorers, Cook, Vancouver, and\r\nothers, arrived there during the Georgian era. An American is a\r\n“Boston-man,” because the first ships from the United States which visited\r\nthat coast hailed from Boston. This lingo has no grammar, and a very few\r\nhundred words satisfies all its requirements. Young ladies, daughters of\r\nHudson’s Bay Company’s employés in Victoria, rattle it off as though it\r\nwere their mother-tongue. “Ikte mika tikkee?” (“What do you want?”) is\r\nprobably the first query to an Indian who arrives, and has something to\r\nsell. “Nika tikkee tabac et la biscuit” (“I want some tobacco and\r\nbiscuit”). “Cleush; mika potlatch salmon?” (“Good; will you give me a\r\nsalmon?”). “Naāāāwitka, Se-ām” (“Yes, sir”); and for a small piece of\r\nblack cake-tobacco and two or three biscuits (sailors’ “hard bread” or\r\n“hard tack”) he will exchange a thirty-pound or so salmon.\r\n\r\nThe Chinook jargon, in skilful hands, is susceptible of much. But it is\r\nnot adapted for sentiment or poetry, although a naval officer, once\r\nstationed on the Pacific side, did evolve an effusion, which the sailor is\r\nalmost sure to hear there. It needed, however, a fair amount of English to\r\nmake it read pleasantly. Old residents and visitors will recognise some of\r\nits stanzas:—\r\n\r\n  “Oh! be not quass of nika;\r\n  Thy seahoose turn on me;\r\n  For thou must but hyas cumtux,\r\n  That I hyas tikkee thee!\r\n  Nika potlatch hyu ictas;\r\n  Nika makook sappalell\r\n  Of persicees and la biscuit,\r\n  I will give thee all thy fill!”\r\n\r\nwhich, addressed to a “sweet Klootchman,” a “forest maiden,” means, that\r\nloving her so much, all that he had was hers. Much greater absurdities\r\nhave been put in plain English.\r\n\r\nA bishop of British Columbia was, however, hardly so successful; not being\r\nhimself a student of Chinook, the entire vocabulary of which would have\r\ntaken him rather less time to learn than the barest elements of Latin, he\r\nengaged an interpreter, through whom to address the Indians. The latter\r\nwas perfectly competent to say all that _can_ be said in Chinook, but was\r\nrather nonplussed when his lordship commenced his address by “Children of\r\nthe forest!” He scratched his head and looked at the bishop, who, however,\r\nwas determined, and commenced once more, “Children of the forest!” The\r\ninterpreter knew that it must make nonsense, but he was cornered, and had\r\nto do it. And this is what he said: “Tenass man copa stick!”—literally,\r\n“Little men among the stumps” (or trunks of trees). The writer will not\r\ncomment upon the subject here, more than to say that Chinook is _not_\r\nadapted for the translation of Milton or Shakespeare; while the simplest\r\nstory or parable of the Scriptures must be unintelligible, or worse, when\r\nattempted in that jargon.\r\n\r\nThe only other settlement on Vancouver Island which has any direct\r\ninterest to the Royal Navy, is Nanaimo, the coal-mines of which yield a\r\nlarge amount of the fuel used by the steamships when in that neighbourhood\r\nand about all that is used on the island; a quantity is also shipped to\r\nSan Francisco. The mines are worked by English companies, and are so near\r\nthe coast that, by means of a few tramways and locomotives, the coal is\r\nconveyed to the wharves, where it can be at once put on board. It is a\r\npleasant little place, and many an English miner would be glad to be as\r\nwell off as the men settled there, who earn more money than at home, own\r\ntheir cottages and plots of land, obtain most of their supplies cheaper\r\nthan in England, and have a beautiful gulf before them, in summer, at\r\nleast, as calm as a lake, on which boating and canoeing is all the rage in\r\nthe evenings or on holidays.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific Station is an extensive one, for it commences at the most\r\nnorthernmost parts of Bering Sea, and extends below Cape Horn. It embraces\r\nthe Alaskan coast. Many English men-of-war have visited these latitudes,\r\nprincipally, however, in the cause of science and discovery.\r\n\r\nIn the old days, when the colony of Russian America was little better than\r\nare many parts of Siberia—convict settlements—the few Government officials\r\nand officers of the Russian Fur Company were, it may well be believed,\r\nonly too ready to welcome any change in the monotony of their existence,\r\nand a new arrival, in the shape of a ship from some foreign port, was a\r\nday to be remembered, and of which to make much. The true Russians are\r\nnaturally hospitably and sociably inclined, and such times were the\r\noccasion for balls, dinners, and parties to any extent. The writer well\r\nremembers his first visit to Sitka, which, although the capital of Alaska,\r\nis situated on an island off the mainland. On approaching the small and\r\npartially land-locked harbour, a mountain of no inconsiderable height,\r\nwooded to the top, appeared in view, and below it a little town of\r\nhighly-coloured roofs, in the middle of which rose a picturesque rock,\r\nsurmounted by a semi-fortified castle, which, in the distance at least,\r\nlooked most imposing. Near this, but separated by a stockade, was the\r\nvillage of the Kalosh Indians, a powerful tribe, who had at times, as the\r\nmembers of the expedition learned, given a considerable amount of trouble\r\nto the Russians—in 1804 they murdered nearly the whole of the Russian\r\ngarrison—while beyond on every side were rocky shores and wooded heights.\r\nAn old hulk or two, lying on the beach below the old castle, itself\r\nprincipally built of wood, the residence of the Governor of Russian\r\nAmerica, then Prince Maksutoff, which had been roofed in and were used for\r\nmagazines of stores, and some rather shaky pile-wharfs, made up the town.\r\n\r\nSoon was experienced the warmth of a Russian welcome, and for a week\r\nafterwards a succession of gaieties followed, which were so very gay that\r\nthey would have killed most men, unless they had been fortified with a\r\nlong sea-trip just before. Every Russian seemed to wish the party to\r\nconsider all that he had at their service; the _samovar_ boiled up\r\neverywhere as they approached; the little lunch-table of anchovies, and\r\npickles, rye-bread, butter, cheese, and so forth, with the everlasting\r\n_vodka_, was everywhere ready, and except duty called, no one was obliged\r\nto go off at night to the three vessels comprising the expedition to which\r\nthe writer was attached, for the best bed in the house was always at his\r\nservice. There was only one bar-room in the whole town, and there only a\r\nkind of _lager-bier_ and _vodka_ were to be obtained. When the country\r\nwas, for a consideration of 7,250,000 dollars, transferred to the United\r\nStates, there was a “rush” from Victoria and San Francisco. Keen Hebrew\r\ntraders, knowing that furs up country bore a merely nominal price, and\r\nthat Sitka was the great _entrepôt_ for their collection—a million\r\ndollars’ worth being frequently gathered there at a time—thought they\r\nwould be able to buy them for next to nothing still. Parcels of land in\r\nthe town, which had not at the utmost a greater value than a few hundred\r\ndollars, now ran up to fabulous prices; 10,000 dollars was asked for a log\r\nhouse! Hotels, “saloons”—_i.e._, bar-rooms _à l’Américaine_—German\r\nlager-bier cellars, and barbers’ shops sprang up like mushrooms; a\r\nnewspaper-office was opened, and everything reminded one of the sudden\r\ngrowth of mining-towns in the early days of California. Alas! everything\r\nelse went up in proportion, excepting salmon, which must be a drug on that\r\ncoast for many centuries to come;(107) provisions greatly rose in price,\r\nand the competition for furs was so great that they became nearly as dear\r\nas in San Francisco. The consequence may be imagined; there was an exodus,\r\nand the following January the whole city could have been bought for a\r\nsong. The Russian officials, of course, left it shortly after the\r\ntransfer, and most of the others as speedily as they could. The “capital”\r\nhas never recovered from the shock; for, although organised fur-companies\r\nare scattered over the country, in one instance the United States\r\nGovernment leasing the sole right—that of fur-sealing, on the Aleutian\r\nIslands—to a firm which has a Russian prince as a partner, Sitka is not\r\nthe _entrepôt_ it was; everything in furs is brought to San Francisco\r\nbefore being consigned to all quarters of the globe. The value of Alaska\r\nto the United States is at present very small, but so little is known\r\nabout it that one can hardly form an estimate concerning its future. It\r\npossesses minerals, but these will always be worked with difficulty, on\r\naccount of the climate. Its grand salmon-fisheries are, however, a\r\ntangible property; the cod in Bering Sea is as plentiful as it ever was on\r\nthe Newfoundland banks; and there are innumerable forests of trees, easily\r\naccessible, reaching down to the coast—of pines, firs, and cedars, of size\r\nsufficient for the tallest masts and largest spars, so that Alaska has a\r\ndirect interest for the ship-builder.\r\n\r\nBy its acquisition, the United States not merely extended its seaboard\r\nfor, say, 1,500 miles north, but it obtained Mount St. Elias, by far the\r\nlargest peak of the North American continent, and one of the loftiest\r\nmountains of the globe. “Upon Mont Blanc,” says an American writer,(108)\r\n“pile the loftiest summit in the British Islands, and they would not reach\r\nthe altitude of Mount St. Elias. If a man could reach its summit, he would\r\nbe two miles nearer the stars than any other American could be, east of\r\nthe Mississippi.... As a single peak it ranks among the half-dozen\r\nloftiest on the globe. Some of the Himalaya summits reach, indeed, a\r\ncouple of miles nearer Orion and the Pleiades, but they rise from an\r\nelevated plateau sloping gradually upwards for hundreds of miles. As an\r\nisolated peak, St. Elias may look down upon Mont Blanc and Teneriffe, and\r\nclaim brotherhood with Chimborazo and Cotopaxi.” It acquired also one of\r\nthe four great rivers of the globe, of which the writer had the pleasure\r\nof being one of the earliest explorers. The Yukon, which renders the\r\nwaters of Bering Sea fresh or semi-fresh for a dozen miles beyond its many\r\nmouths, is a sister-river to the Amazon, Mississippi, and, perhaps, the\r\nPlata; it has affluents to which the Rhine or Rhône are but brooks.\r\n\r\nThe Kalosh Indians of Sitka live in semi-civilised wooden barns or houses,\r\nwith invariably a round hole for a door, through which one creeps. They\r\nare particularly ingenious in carving; and Jack has many an opportunity of\r\nobtaining grotesque figures, cut from wood or slate-stone, for a cast-off\r\ngarment or a half-dollar. One brought home represents the Russian soldier\r\nof the period, prior to the American annexation, and is scarcely a\r\nburlesque of his stolid face, gigantic moustache, close fitting coat with\r\nvery tight sleeves, and loose, baggy trousers. Masks may be seen cut from\r\nsome white stone, which would not do dishonour to a European sculptor. But\r\nnow, leaving Sitka, let us make a rapid trip to the extreme northern end\r\nof the Pacific Station.\r\n\r\nMen-of-war proceeding north of Sitka—which, except for purposes of science\r\nor war, is not likely to be the case, although the Pacific Station extends\r\nto the northernmost parts of Alaska—would voyage into Bering Sea through\r\nOunimak Pass, one of the best passages between the rocky and rugged\r\nAleutian Islands. In the pass the scenery is superb, grand volcanic peaks\r\nrising in all directions. While there, many years ago, the writer well\r\nremembers going on deck one morning, when mists and low clouds hung over\r\nthe then placid waters, and seeing what appeared to be a magnificent\r\nmountain peak, snowy and scarped, right overhead the vessel, and having a\r\nwreath of white cloud surrounding it, while a lower and greyer bank of\r\nmist hid its base. It seemed baseless, and as though rising from nothing;\r\nwhile the bright sunlight above all, and which did not reach the vessel,\r\nlit up the eternal snows in brilliant contrasts of light and shadow. This\r\nwas the grand peak of Sheshaldinski, which rises nearly 9,000 feet above\r\nthe sea level.\r\n\r\nThe Aleutian Islands are thinly inhabited, and the Aleuts—a harmless,\r\nstrong, half-Esquimaux kind of people—often leave them. They make very\r\ngood sailors. The few Russian settlements, among the principal of which\r\nwas Kodiak, were simply trading posts and fur-sealing establishments.\r\nSince the purchase of Alaska, the United States Government has leased them\r\nto a large mercantile firm, which makes profits from the sealing. North of\r\nthe islands, after steaming over a considerable waste of waters, the only\r\nsettlements on the coast of the whole country are Michaelovski and\r\nUnalachleet, both trading posts; while south of the former are the many\r\nmouths of one of the grandest rivers in the world, the Yukon, almost a\r\nrival to the Amazon and Mississippi. That section of the country lying\r\nround the great river is tolerably rich in fur-bearing animals, including\r\nsable, mink, black and silver-grey fox, beaver, and bear. The moose and\r\ndeer abound; while fish, more especially salmon, is very abundant. Salmon,\r\nthirty or more pounds in weight, caught in the Yukon, has often been\r\npurchased for a half-ounce of tobacco or four or five common\r\nsewing-needles. The coasts of Northern Alaska are rugged and uninviting,\r\nand not remarkable for the grand scenery common in the southern division.\r\n\r\nLeaving the north, and passing the leading station already described on\r\nVancouver Island, the sailor has the whole Pacific coasts of both\r\nAmericas, clear to Cape Horn, before him as part of the Pacific Station.\r\nThere is Mexico, with its port of Acapulco; New Granada, with the\r\nimportant sea-port town of Panama; Callao, Peru; and Valparaiso, in Chili:\r\nat any of which H.B.M. vessels are commonly to be found. Panama is,\r\nindeed, a very important central point, as officers of the Royal Navy,\r\nordered to join vessels elsewhere, usually leave their own at Panama,\r\ncross the isthmus, and take steamer to England, _viâ_ St. Thomas’s, or by\r\nway of New York, thence crossing to Liverpool. The railroad—which, during\r\nits construction, is said to have cost the life of a Chinaman for every\r\nsleeper laid down, so fatal was the fever of the isthmus—has the dearest\r\nfares of any in the world. The distance from Panama across to Aspinwall\r\n(Colon) is about forty miles, and the fare is £5! An immense amount of\r\ntravel crosses the isthmus; and it is only matter of time for a canal to\r\nbe cut through some portion of it, or the isthmus of Darien adjoining.\r\nSteamers of the largest kind are arriving daily at Panama from San\r\nFrancisco, Mexico, and all parts of South America; while, on the Atlantic\r\nside, they come from Southampton, Liverpool, New York and other American\r\nports.\r\n\r\nSouthward, with favouring breezes and usually calm seas, one soon arrives\r\nat Callao—a place which may yet become a great city, but which, like\r\neverything else in Peru, has been retarded by interminable dissensions in\r\nregard to government and politics, and by the ignorance and bigotry of the\r\nmasses. Peru had an advantage over Chili in wealth and importance at one\r\ntime; but, while the latter country is to-day one of the most satisfactory\r\nand stable republics in the world, one never knows what is going to happen\r\nnext in Peru. Hence distrust in commerce; and hence the sailor will not\r\nfind a tithe of the shipping in Callao Roads that he will at the wharfs of\r\nValparaiso. Lima, the capital, is situated behind Callao, at a distance of\r\nabout six miles. When seen from the deck of a vessel in the roadstead, the\r\ncity has a most imposing appearance, with its innumerable domes and spires\r\nrising from so elevated a situation, and wearing a strange and rather\r\nMoorish air. On nearing the city, everything speaks eloquently of past\r\nsplendour and present wretchedness; public walks and elegant ornamental\r\nstone seats choked with rank weeds, and all in ruins. You enter Lima\r\nthrough a triumphal arch, tawdry and tumbling to pieces; you find that the\r\nchurches, which looked so imposing in the distance, are principally stucco\r\nand tinsel. Lima has a novelty in one of its theatres. It is built in a\r\nlong oval, the stage occupying nearly the whole of one long side, all the\r\nboxes being thus comparatively near it. The pit audience is men, and the\r\ngalleries, women; and all help to fill the house, between the acts, with\r\ntobacco smoke from their cigarettes.\r\n\r\nThe sailor, who has been much among Spanish people or those of Spanish\r\norigin, will find the Chilians the finest race in South America.\r\nValparaiso Harbour is always full of shipping, its wharfs piled with\r\ngoods; while the railroad and old road to the capital, Santiago, bears\r\nevidence of the material prosperity of the country. The country roads are\r\ncrowded with convoys of pack-mules, while the ships are loading up with\r\nwheat, wines, and minerals, the produce of the country. Travelling is free\r\neverywhere. Libraries, schools, literary, scientific, and artistic\r\nsocieties abound; the best newspapers published in South America are\r\nissued there. Santiago, the city of marble palaces—where even horses are\r\nkept in marble stalls—is one of the most delightful places in the world.\r\nThe lofty Andes tower to the skies in the distance, forming a grand\r\nbackground, and a fruitful, cultivated, and peaceful country surrounds it.\r\n\r\nValparaiso—the “Vale of Paradise”—was probably named by the early Spanish\r\nadventurers in this glowing style because any coast whatever is delightful\r\nto the mariner who has been long at sea. Otherwise, the title would seem\r\nto be of an exaggerated nature. The bay is of a semi-circular form,\r\nsurrounded by steep hills, rising to the height of near 2,000 feet,\r\nsparingly covered with stunted shrubs and thinly-strewed grass. The town\r\nis built along a narrow strip of land, between the cliffs and the sea;\r\nand, as this space is limited in extent, the buildings have straggled up\r\nthe sides and bottoms of the numerous ravines which intersect the hills. A\r\nsuburb—the Almendral, or Almond Grove—much larger than the town proper,\r\nspreads over a low sandy plain, about half a mile broad, bordering the\r\nbay. In the summer months—_i.e._, November to March—the anchorage is safe\r\nand pleasant; but in the wintry months, notably June and July, gales are\r\nprevalent from the north, in which direction it is open to the sea.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: THE PORT OF VALPARAISO.]\r\n\r\nCaptain Basil Hall, R.N., gave some interesting accounts of life in Chili\r\nin his published Journal,(109) and they are substantially true at the\r\npresent day. He reached Valparaiso at Christmas, which corresponds in\r\nclimate to our midsummer. Crowds thronged the streets to enjoy the cool\r\nair in the moonlight; groups of merry dancers were seen at every turn;\r\nsingers were bawling out old Spanish romances to the tinkle of the guitar;\r\nwild-looking horsemen pranced about in all directions, stopping to talk\r\nwith their friends, but never dismounting; and harmless bull-fights, in\r\nwhich the bulls were only teased, not killed, served to make the people\r\nlaugh. The whole town was _en carnival_. “In the course of the first\r\nevening of these festivities,” says Captain Hall, “while I was rambling\r\nabout the streets with one of the officers of the ship, our attention was\r\nattracted, by the sound of music, to a crowded pulperia, or\r\ndrinking-house. We accordingly entered, and the people immediately made\r\nway and gave us seats at the upper end of the apartment. We had not sat\r\nlong before we were startled by the loud clatter of horses’ feet, and in\r\nthe next instant, a mounted peasant dashed into the company, followed by\r\nanother horseman, who, as soon as he reached the centre of the room,\r\nadroitly wheeled his horse round, and the two strangers remained side by\r\nside, with their horses’ heads in opposite directions. Neither the people\r\nof the house, nor the guests, nor the musicians, appeared in the least\r\nsurprised by this visit; the lady who was playing the harp merely stopped\r\nfor a moment to remove the end of the instrument a few inches further from\r\nthe horses’ feet, and the music and conversation went on as before. The\r\nvisitors called for a glass of spirits, and having chatted with their\r\nfriends around them for two minutes, stooped their heads to avoid the\r\ncross-piece of the doorway, and putting spurs to their horses’ sides, shot\r\ninto the streets as rapidly as they had entered; the whole being done\r\nwithout discomposing the company in the smallest degree.” The same writer\r\nspeaks of the common people as generally very temperate, while their\r\nfrankness and hospitality charmed him. Brick-makers, day-labourers, and\r\nwasherwomen invited him and friends into their homes, and their first\r\nanxiety was that the sailors might “feel themselves in their own house;”\r\nthen some offering of milk, bread, or spirits. However wretched the\r\ncottage or poor the fare, the deficiency was never made more apparent by\r\napologies; with untaught politeness, the best they had was placed before\r\nthem, graced with a hearty welcome. Their houses are of adobes, _i.e._,\r\nsun-dried bricks, thatched in with broad palm-leaves, the ends of which,\r\nby overhanging the walls, afford shade from the scorching sun and shelter\r\nfrom the rain. Their mud floors have a portion raised seven or eight\r\ninches above the level of the rest, and covered with matting, which forms\r\nthe couch for the invariable _siesta_. In the cottages Hall saw young\r\nwomen grinding baked corn in almost Scriptural mills of two stones each.\r\nFrom the coarse flour obtained, the poor people make a drink called\r\n_ulpa_. In the better class of houses he was offered Paraguay tea, or\r\nmattee, an infusion of a South American herb. The natives drink it almost\r\nboiling hot. It is drawn up into the mouth through a silver pipe: however\r\nnumerous the company, all use the same tube, and to decline on this\r\naccount is thought the height of rudeness. The people of Chili, generally,\r\nare polite to a degree; and Jack ashore will have no cause to complain,\r\nprovided he is as polished as are they. He generally contrives, however,\r\nto make himself popular, while his little escapades of wildness are looked\r\nupon in the light of long pent-up nature bursting forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ROUND THE WORLD ON A MAN-OF-WAR (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n                        FROM THE HORN TO HALIFAX.\r\n\r\n\r\n       The dreaded Horn—The Land of Fire—Basil Hall’s Phenomenon—A\r\n    Missing Volcano—The South American Station—Falkland Islands—A Free\r\n    Port and Naval Station—Penguins, Peat, and Kelp—Sea Trees—The West\r\n         India Station—Trinidad—Columbus’s First View of it—Fatal\r\n          Gold—Charles Kingsley’s Enthusiasm—The Port of Spain—A\r\n         Happy-go-lucky People—Negro Life—Letters from a Cottage\r\n          Ornée—Tropical Vegetation—Animal Life—Jamaica—Kingston\r\n         Harbour—Sugar Cultivation—The Queen of the Antilles—Its\r\n    Paseo—Beauty of the Archipelago—A Dutch Settlement in the Heart of\r\n          a Volcano—Among the Islands—The Souffrière—Historical\r\n    Reminiscences—Bermuda: Colony, Fortress, and Prison—Home of Ariel\r\n     and Caliban—The Whitest Place in the World—Bermuda Convicts—New\r\n    York Harbour—The City—First Impressions—Its fine Position—Splendid\r\n           Harbour—Forest of Masts—The Ferry-boats, Hotels, and\r\n    Bars—Offenbach’s Impressions—Broadway, Fulton Market, and Central\r\n         Park—New York in Winter—Frozen Ships—The great Brooklyn\r\n    Bridge—Halifax and its Beauties—Importance of the Station—Bedford\r\n        Basin—The Early Settlers—The Blue Noses—Adieu to America.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now the exigencies of the service require us to tear ourselves away\r\nfrom gay and pleasant Valparaiso, and voyage in spirit round the Horn to\r\nthe South-East American Station, which includes the whole coast, from\r\nTerra del Fuego to Brazil and Guiana. Friendly ports, Rio and Montevideo,\r\nare open to the Royal Navy as stations for necessary repairs or supplies;\r\nbut the only strictly British port on the whole station is that at the\r\ndreary Falkland Islands, to be shortly described.\r\n\r\nEvery schoolboy knows that Cape Horn is even more dreaded than the other\r\n“Cape of Storms,” otherwise known as “The Cape,” _par excellence_. In\r\nthese days, the introduction of steam has reduced much of the danger and\r\nhorrors of the passage round, though on occasions they are sufficiently\r\nserious. In fact, now that there is a regular tug-boat service in the\r\nStraits of Magellan, there is really no occasion to go round it at all. In\r\n1862 the writer rounded it, in a steamer of good power, when the water was\r\nas still as a mill-pond, and the Horn itself—a barren, black, craggy,\r\nprecipitous rock, towering above the utter desolation and bleakest\r\nsolitudes of that forsaken spot—was plainly in sight.\r\n\r\nCaptain Basil Hall, and his officers and crew, in 1820, when rounding Cape\r\nHorn observed a remarkable phenomenon, which may account for the title of\r\nthe “Land of Fire” bestowed upon it by Magellan. A brilliant light\r\nsuddenly appeared in the north-western quarter. “At first of a bright red,\r\nit became fainter and fainter, till it disappeared altogether. After the\r\nlapse of four or five minutes, its brilliancy was suddenly restored, and\r\nit seemed as if a column of burning materials had been projected into the\r\nair. This bright appearance lasted from ten to twenty seconds, fading by\r\ndegrees as the column became lower, till at length only a dull red mass\r\nwas distinguishable for about a minute, after which it again vanished.”\r\nThe sailors thought it a revolving light, others that it must be a forest\r\non fire. All who examined it carefully through a telescope agreed in\r\nconsidering it a volcano, like Stromboli, emitting alternately jets of\r\nflame and red-hot stones. The light was visible till morning; and although\r\nduring the night it appeared to be not more than eight or ten miles off,\r\nno land was to be seen. The present writer would suggest the probability\r\nof its having been an electrical phenomenon.\r\n\r\n                        [Illustration: CAPE HORN.]\r\n\r\nThe naval station at the Falklands is at Port Stanley, on the eastern\r\nisland, where there is a splendid land-locked harbour, with a narrow\r\nentrance. The little port is, and has been, a haven of refuge for many a\r\nstorm-beaten mariner: not merely from the fury of the elements, but also\r\nbecause supplies of fresh meat can be obtained there, and, indeed,\r\neverything else. Wild cattle, of old Spanish stock, roam at will over many\r\nparts of the two islands. When the writer was there, in 1862, beef was\r\nretailed at fourpence per pound, and Port Stanley being a free port,\r\neverything was very cheap. How many boxes of cigars, pounds of tobacco,\r\ncases of hollands, and demijohns of rum were, in consequence, taken on\r\nboard by his 300 fellow-passengers would be a serious calculation. The\r\nlittle town has not much to recommend it: It has, of course, a Government\r\nHouse and a church, and barracks for the marines stationed there. It is,\r\nmoreover, the head-quarters of the Falkland Islands Company, a corporation\r\nmuch like the Hudson’s Bay Company, trading in furs and hides, and stores\r\nfor ships and native trade. The three great characteristics of Port\r\nStanley are the penguins, which abound, and are to be seen waddling in\r\ntroops in its immediate vicinity, and stumbling over the stones if\r\npursued; the kelp, which is so thick and strong in the water at the edge\r\nof the bay in places, that a strong boat’s crew can hardly get “way”\r\nenough on to reach the shore; and the peat-bogs, which would remind an\r\nIrishman of his beloved Erin. Peat is the principal fuel of the place; and\r\nwhat glorious fires it makes! At least, so thought a good many of the\r\npassengers who took the opportunity of living on shore during the\r\nfortnight of the vessel’s stay. For about three shillings and sixpence a\r\nday one could obtain a good bed, meals of beef-steaks and joints and fresh\r\nvegetables—very welcome after the everlasting salt junk and preserved\r\nvegetables of the ship—with the addition of hot rum and water, nearly _ad\r\nlibitum_. Then the privilege of stretching one’s legs is something, after\r\nfive or six weeks’ confinement. There is duck and loon-shooting to be had,\r\nor an excursion to the lighthouse, a few miles from the town, where the\r\nwriter found children, of several years of age, who had never even beheld\r\nthe glories of Port Stanley, and yet were happy; and near which he saw on\r\nthe beach _sea-trees_—for “sea-weed” would be a misnomer, the trunks being\r\nseveral feet in circumference—slippery, glutinous, marine vegetation,\r\nuprooted from the depths of ocean. Some of them would create a sensation\r\nin an aquarium.\r\n\r\nThe harbour of Port Stanley is usually safe enough, but, in the\r\nextraordinary gales which often rage outside, does not always afford safe\r\nanchorage. The steamship on which the writer was a passenger lay far out\r\nin the bay, but the force of a sudden gale made her drag her anchors, and\r\nbut for the steam, which was immediately got up, she would have gone\r\nashore. A sailing-vessel must have been wrecked in the same position. Of\r\ncourse, the power of the engines was set against the wind, and she was\r\nsaved. Passengers ashore could not get off for two days, and those on\r\nboard could not go ashore. No boat could have lived, even in the bay,\r\nduring a large part of the time.\r\n\r\nThe West Indian Station demands our attention next. Unfortunately, it must\r\nnot take the space it deserves, for it would occupy that required for ten\r\nbooks of the size of this—ay, twenty—to do it the barest justice. Why?\r\nRead Charles Kingsley’s admirable work, “At Last”—one, alas! of the last\r\ntasks of a well-spent life—and one will see England’s interest in those\r\nislands, and must think also of those earlier days, when Columbus, Drake,\r\nand Raleigh sailed among the waters which divide them—days of geographical\r\ndiscovery worth speaking of, of grand triumphs over foes worth fighting,\r\nand of gain amounting to something.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: THE LANDING OF COLUMBUS AT TRINIDAD.]\r\n\r\nOn the 31st July, 1499, Columbus, on his third voyage, sighted the three\r\nhills which make the south-eastern end of Trinidad. He had determined to\r\nname the first land he should sight after the Holy Trinity, and so he did.\r\nThe triple peaks probably reminded him.\r\n\r\nWashington Irving tells us, in his “Life of Columbus,” that he was\r\nastonished at the verdure and fertility of the country, having expected\r\nthat it would be parched, dry, and sterile as he approached the equator;\r\nwhereas, he beheld beautiful groves of palm-trees, and luxuriant forests\r\nsweeping down to the sea-side, with gurgling brooks and clear, deep\r\nstreams beneath the shade. The softness and purity of the climate, and the\r\nbeauty of the country, seemed, after his long sea voyage, to rival the\r\nbeautiful province of Valencia itself. Columbus found the people a race of\r\nIndians fairer than any he had seen before, “of good stature, and of very\r\ngraceful bearing.” They carried square bucklers, and had bows and arrows,\r\nwith which they made feeble attempts to drive off the Spaniards who landed\r\nat Punta Arenal, near Icacque, and who, finding no streams, sank holes in\r\nthe sand, and so filled their casks with fresh water—as is done by sailors\r\nnow-a-days in many parts of the world. “And there,” says Kingsley, “that\r\nsource of endless misery to these harmless creatures, a certain Cacique—so\r\ngoes the tale—took off Columbus’s cap of crimson velvet, and replaced it\r\nwith a circle of gold which he wore.”\r\n\r\nAlas for them! that fatal present of gold brought down on them enemies far\r\nmore ruthless than the Caribs of the northern islands, who had a habit of\r\ncoming down in their canoes and carrying off the gentle Arrawaks, to eat\r\nthem at their leisure—after the fashion which Defoe, always accurate, has\r\nimmortalised in “Robinson Crusoe.” Crusoe’s island has been thought by\r\nmany to be meant for Tobago; Man Friday having been stolen in Trinidad.\r\n\r\nNo scenery can be more picturesque than that afforded by the entrance to\r\nPort of Spain, the chief town in the colony of Trinidad, itself an island\r\nlying outside the delta of the great Orinoco River. “On the mainland,”\r\nwrote Anthony Trollope,(110) “that is, the land of the main island, the\r\ncoast is precipitous, but clothed to the very top with the thickest and\r\nmost magnificent foliage. With an opera-glass, one can distinctly see the\r\ntrees coming forth from the sides of the rocks, as though no soil were\r\nnecessary for them, and not even a shelf of stone needed for their\r\nsupport. And these are not shrubs, but forest trees, with grand spreading\r\nbranches, huge trunks, and brilliant-coloured foliage. The small island on\r\nthe other side is almost equally wooded, but is less precipitous.” There,\r\nand on the main island itself, are nooks and open glades where one would\r\nnot be badly off with straw hats and muslin, pigeon-pies and champagne.\r\nOne narrow shady valley, into which a creek of the sea ran, made Trollope\r\nthink that it must have been intended for “the less noisy joys of some\r\nPaul of Trinidad with his Creole Virginia.” The same writer, after\r\ndescribing the Savannah, which includes a park and race-course, speaks of\r\nthe Government House, then under repairs. The governor was living in a\r\ncottage, hard by. “Were I that great man,” said he, “I should be tempted\r\nto wish that my great house might always be under repair, for I never saw\r\na more perfect specimen of a pretty spacious cottage, opening, as a\r\ncottage should do, on all sides and in every direction.... And then the\r\nnecessary freedom from boredom, etiquette, and governors’ grandeur, so\r\nhated by governors themselves, which must necessarily be brought about by\r\nsuch a residence! I could almost wish to be a governor myself, if I might\r\nbe allowed to live in such a cottage.” The buildings of Port of Spain are\r\nalmost invariably surrounded by handsome flowering trees. A later writer\r\ntells us that the governors since have stuck to the cottage, and the\r\ngardens of the older building have been given to the city as a public\r\npleasure-ground. Kingsley speaks of it as a paradise.\r\n\r\nJack ashore, who, after a long and perhaps stormy voyage, would look upon\r\nany land as a haven of delight, will certainly think that he has at last\r\nreached the “happy land.” It is not merely the climate, the beauty, or the\r\nproductions of the country; nor the West Indian politeness and\r\nhospitality—both proverbial; but the fact that nobody seems to do, or\r\nwants to do, anything, and yet lives ten times as well as the poorer\r\nclasses of England. There are 8,000 or more human beings in Port of Spain\r\nalone, who “toil not, neither do they spin,” and have no other visible\r\nmeans of subsistence except eating something or other—mostly fruit—all the\r\nlive-long day, who are happy, very happy. The truth is, that though they\r\nwill, and frequently do, eat more than a European, they can almost do\r\nwithout food, and can live, like the Lazzaroni, on warmth and light. “The\r\nbest substitute for a dinner is a sleep under a south wall in the blazing\r\nsun; and there are plenty of south walls in Port of Spain.” Has not a poor\r\nman, under these circumstances, the same right to be idle as a rich one?\r\nEvery one there looks strong, healthy, and well-fed. The author of\r\n“Westward Ho!” was not likely to be deceived, and says: “One meets few or\r\nnone of those figures and faces—small, scrofulous, squinny, and\r\nhaggard—which disgrace the civilisation of a British city. Nowhere in Port\r\nof Spain will you see such human beings as in certain streets of London,\r\nLiverpool, and Glasgow. Every one plainly can live and thrive if they\r\nchoose; and very pleasant it is to know that.” And wonderfully well does\r\nthat mixed and happy-go-lucky population assimilate. Trinidad belongs to\r\nGreat Britain; but there are more negroes, half-breeds, Hindoos, and\r\nChinese there than Britons by ten times ten; and the language of the\r\nisland is mainly French, not English or Spanish. Under cool porticoes and\r\nthrough tall doorways are seen dark shops, built on Spanish models, and\r\nfilled with everything under the sun. On the doorsteps sit negresses, in\r\nflashy Manchester “prints” and stiff turbans, “all aiding in the general\r\nwork of doing nothing,” or offering for sale fruits, sweetmeats, or chunks\r\nof sugar-cane. These women, as well as the men, invariably carry\r\neverything on their heads, whether it be a half-barrow load of yams, a few\r\nounces of sugar, or a beer-bottle.\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: VIEW IN JAMAICA.]\r\n\r\nOne of the regrets of an enthusiastic writer must ever be that he cannot\r\nvisit all the lovely and interesting spots which he may so easily\r\ndescribe. The present one, enamoured with San Francisco, which he _has_\r\nvisited, and Singapore and Sydney, which as yet he hasn’t, would, if such\r\nwriters as Charles Kingsley and Anthony Trollope are to be credited, add\r\nTrinidad to the list. Read the former’s “Letter from a West Indian Cottage\r\nOrnée,” or the latter’s description of a ride through the cool woods and\r\nsea-shore roads, to be convinced that Trinidad is one of the most charming\r\nislands in the whole world. Bamboos keep the cottage gravel path up, and\r\nas tubes, carry the trickling, cool water to the cottage bath; you hear a\r\nrattling as of boards or stiff paper outside your window: it is the\r\nclashing together of a fan-palm, with leaf-stalks ten feet long and fans\r\nmore feet wide. The orange, the pine-apple, and the “flower fence”\r\n(_Poinziana_); the cocoa-palm, the tall Guinea grass, and the “groo-groos”\r\n(a kind of palm: _Acrocomia sclerocarpa_); the silk-cotton tree, the\r\ntamarind, and the Rosa del monte bushes—twenty feet high, and covered with\r\ncrimson roses; tea shrubs, myrtles, and clove-trees intermingle with\r\nvegetation common elsewhere. Thus much for a mere chance view.\r\n\r\nThe seaman ashore will note many of these beauties; but his superior\r\nofficers will see more. The _cottage ornée_, to which they will be\r\ninvited, with its lawn and flowering shrubs, tiny specimens of which we\r\nadmire in hot-houses at home; the grass as green as that of England, and\r\nwinding away in the cool shade of strange evergreens; the yellow cocoa-nut\r\npalms on the nearest spur of hill throwing back the tender blue of the\r\ndistant mountains; groups of palms, with perhaps _Erythrinas umbrosa_\r\n(_Bois immortelles_, they call them in Trinidad), with vermilion\r\nflowers—trees of red coral, sixty feet high—interspersed; a glimpse beyond\r\nof the bright and sleeping sea, and the islands of the Bocas “floating in\r\nthe shining waters,” and behind a luxuriously furnished cottage, where\r\nhospitality is not a mere name, but a very sound fact; what on earth can\r\nman want more?\r\n\r\nKingsley, in presence of the rich and luscious beauty, the vastness and\r\nrepose, to be found in Trinidad, sees an understandable excuse for the\r\ntendency to somewhat grandiose language which tempts perpetually those who\r\ntry to describe the tropics, and know well that they can only fail. He\r\nsays: “In presence of such forms and such colouring as this, one becomes\r\npainfully sensible of the poverty of words, and the futility, therefore,\r\nof all word-painting; of the inability, too, of the senses to discern and\r\ndefine objects of such vast variety; of our æsthetic barbarism, in fact,\r\nwhich has no choice of epithets, save such as ‘great,’ and ‘vast,’ and\r\n‘gigantic;’ between such as ‘beautiful,’ and ‘lovely,’ and ‘exquisite,’\r\nand so forth: which are, after all, intellectually only one stage higher\r\nthan the half-brute ‘Wah! wah!’ with which the savage grunts his\r\nastonishment—call it not admiration; epithets which are not, perhaps,\r\nintellectually as high as the ‘God is great!’ of the Mussulman, who is\r\nwise enough not to attempt any analysis, either of Nature or of his\r\nfeelings about her, and wise enough, also ... in presence of the unknown,\r\nto take refuge in God.”\r\n\r\nMonkeys of many kinds, jaguars, toucans, wild cats; wonderful ant-eaters,\r\nracoons, and lizards; and strange birds, butterflies, wasps, and spiders\r\nabound, but none of those animals which resent the presence of man. Happy\r\nland!\r\n\r\nBut the gun has fired. H.M.S. _Sea_ is getting all steam up. The privilege\r\nof leave cannot last for ever: it is “All aboard!” Whither bound? In the\r\narchipelago of the West Indies there are so many points of interest, and\r\nso many ports which the sailor of the Royal Navy is sure to visit. There\r\nare important docks at Antigua, Jamaica, and Bermuda; while the whole\r\nstation—known professionally as the “North American and West\r\nIndian”—reaches from the north of South America to beyond Newfoundland,\r\nKingston, and Jamaica, where England maintains a flag-ship and a\r\ncommodore, a dockyard, and a naval hospital.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: KINGSTON HARBOUR, JAMAICA.]\r\n\r\nKingston Harbour is a grand lagoon, nearly shut in by a long sand-spit, or\r\nrather bank, called “The Palisades,” at the point of which is Port Royal,\r\nwhich, about ninety years ago, was nearly destroyed by an earthquake. Mr.\r\nTrollope says that it is on record that hardy “subs” and hardier “mids”\r\nhave ridden along the Palisades, and have not died from sunstroke in the\r\neffort. But the chances were much against them. The ordinary ingress and\r\negress, as to all parts of the island’s coasts, is by water. Our naval\r\nestablishment is at Port Royal.\r\n\r\nJamaica has picked up a good deal in these later days, but is not the\r\nthriving country it was before the abolition of slavery. Kingston is\r\ndescribed as a formal city, with streets at right angles, and with\r\ngenerally ugly buildings. The fact is, that hardly any Europeans or even\r\nwell-to-do Creoles live in the town, and, in consequence, there are long\r\nstreets, which might almost belong to a city of the dead, where hardly a\r\nsoul is to be seen: at all events, in the evenings. All the wealthier\r\npeople—and there are a large number—have country seats—“pens,” as they\r\ncall them, though often so charmingly situated, and so beautifully\r\nsurrounded, that the term does not seem very appropriate. The sailor’s\r\npocket-money will go a long way in Kingston, if he confines himself to\r\nnative productions; but woe unto him if he will insist on imported\r\narticles! All through the island the white people are very English in\r\ntheir longings, and affect to despise the native luxuries. Thus, they will\r\ngive you ox-tail soup when real turtle would be infinitely cheaper. “When\r\nyams, avocado pears, the mountain cabbage, plantains, and twenty other\r\ndelicious vegetables may be had for the gathering, people will insist on\r\neating bad English potatoes; and the desire for English pickles is quite a\r\npassion.” All the servants are negroes or mulattoes, who are greatly\r\naverse to ridicule or patronage; while, if one orders them as is usual in\r\nEngland, they leave you to wait on yourself. Mr. Trollope discovered this.\r\nHe ordered a lad in one of the hotels to fill his bath, calling him “old\r\nfellow.” “Who you call fellor?” asked the youth; “you speak to a gen’lman\r\ngen’lmanly, and den he fill de bath.”\r\n\r\nThe sugar-cane—and by consequence, sugar and rum—coffee, and of late\r\ntobacco, are the staple productions of Jamaica. There is one district\r\nwhere the traveller may see an unbroken plain of 4,000 acres under canes.\r\nThe road over Mount Diabolo is very fine, and the view back to Kingston\r\nvery grand. Jack ashore will find that the people all ride, but that the\r\nhorses always walk. There are respectable mountains to be ascended in\r\nJamaica: Blue Mountain Peak towers to the height of 8,000 feet. The\r\nhighest inhabited house on the island, the property of a coffee-planter,\r\nis a kind of half-way house of entertainment; and although Mr.\r\nTrollope—who provided himself with a white companion, who, in his turn,\r\nprovided five negroes, beef, bread, water, brandy, and what seemed to him\r\nabout ten gallons of rum—gives a doleful description of the clouds and\r\nmists and fogs which surrounded the Peak, others may be more fortunate.\r\n\r\nThe most important of the West Indian Islands, Cuba—“Queen of the\r\nAntilles”—does not, as we all know, belong to England, but is the most\r\nsplendid appanage of the Spanish crown. Havana, the capital, has a grand\r\nharbour, large, commodious, and safe, with a fine quay, at which the\r\nvessels of all nations lie. The sailor will note one peculiarity: instead\r\nof laying alongside, the ships are fastened “end on”—usually the bow being\r\nat the quay. The harbour is very picturesque, and the entrance to it is\r\ndefended by two forts, which were taken once by England—in Albemarle’s\r\ntime—and now could be knocked to pieces in a few minutes by any nation\r\nwhich was ready with the requisite amount of gunpowder.\r\n\r\n                         [Illustration: HAVANA.]\r\n\r\nHavana is a very gay city, and has some special attractions for the\r\nsailor—among others being its good cigars and cheap Spanish wine and\r\nfruits. Its greatest glory is the Paseo—its Hyde Park, Bois de Boulogne,\r\nCorso, Cascine, Alamèda—where the Cuban belles and beaux delight to\r\npromenade and ride. There will you see them, in bright-coloured,\r\npicturesque attire—sadly Europeanised and Americanised of late,\r\nthough—seated in the volante, a kind of hanging cabriolet, between two\r\nlarge wheels, drawn by one or two horses, on one of which the negro\r\nservant, with enormous leggings, white breeches, red jacket, and gold\r\nlace, and broad-brimmed straw hat, rides. The volante is itself bright\r\nwith polished metal, and the whole turn-out has an air of barbaric\r\nsplendour. These carriages are never kept in a coach-house, but are\r\nusually placed in the halls, and often even in the dining-room, as a\r\nchild’s perambulator might with us. Havana has an ugly cathedral and a\r\nmagnificent opera-house.\r\n\r\nSlave labour is common, and many of the sugar and tobacco planters are\r\nvery wealthy. Properties of many hundred acres under cultivation are\r\ncommon. Mr. Trollope found the negroes well-fed, sleek, and fat as\r\nbrewers’ horses, while no sign of ill-usage came before him. In crop times\r\nthey sometimes work sixteen hours a day, and Sunday is not then a day of\r\nrest for them. There are many Chinese coolies, also, on the island.\r\n\r\nKingsley, speaking of the islands in general, says that he “was altogether\r\nunprepared for their beauty and grandeur.” Day after day, the steamer took\r\nhim past a shifting diorama of scenery, which he likened to Vesuvius and\r\nNaples, repeated again and again, with every possible variation of the\r\nsame type of delicate loveliness. Under a cloudless sky, and over the blue\r\nwaters, banks of light cloud turned to violet and then to green, and then\r\ndisclosed grand mountains, with the surf beating white around the base of\r\ntall cliffs and isolated rocks, and the pretty country houses of settlers\r\nembowered in foliage, and gay little villages, and busy towns. “It was\r\neasy,” says that charming writer, “in presence of such scenery, to\r\nconceive the exultation which possessed the souls of the first discoverers\r\nof the West Indies. What wonder if they seemed to themselves to have burst\r\ninto fairy-land—to be at the gates of the earthly Paradise? With such a\r\nclimate, such a soil, such vegetation, such fruits, what luxury must not\r\nhave seemed possible to the dwellers along those shores? What riches, too,\r\nof gold and jewels, might not be hidden among those forest-shrouded glens\r\nand peaks? And beyond, and beyond again, ever new islands, new continents,\r\nperhaps, and inexhaustible wealth of yet undiscovered worlds.”(111)\r\n\r\nThe resemblance to Mediterranean, or, more especially, Neapolitan, scenery\r\nis very marked. “Like causes have produced like effects; and each island\r\nis little but the peak of a volcano, down whose shoulders lava and ash\r\nhave slidden toward the sea.” Many carry several cones. One of them, a\r\nlittle island named Saba, has a most remarkable settlement _half-way up a\r\nvolcano_. Saba rises sheer out of the sea 1,500 or more feet, and, from a\r\nlittle landing-place, a stair runs up 800 feet into the very bosom of the\r\nmountain, where in a hollow live some 1,200 honest Dutchmen and 800\r\nnegroes. The latter were, till of late years, nominally the slaves of the\r\nformer; but it is said that, in reality, it was just the other way. The\r\nblacks went off when and whither they pleased, earned money on other\r\nislands, and expected their masters to keep them when they were out of\r\nwork. The good Dutch live peaceably aloft in their volcano, grow garden\r\ncrops, and sell them to vessels or to surrounding islands. They build the\r\nbest boats in the West Indies up in their crater, and lower them down the\r\ncliff to the sea! They are excellent sailors and good Christians. Long may\r\ntheir volcano remain quiescent!\r\n\r\nWhen the steamer stops at some little port, or even single settlement, the\r\nnegro boats come alongside with luscious fruit and vegetables—bananas and\r\ngreen oranges; the sweet sop, a fruit which looks like a strawberry, and\r\nis as big as an orange; the custard-apples—the pulp of which, those who\r\nhave read “Tom Cringle’s Log” will remember, is fancied to have an\r\nunpleasant resemblance to brains; the avocado, or alligator-pears,\r\notherwise called “midshipman’s butter,” which are eaten with pepper and\r\nsalt; scarlet capsicums, green and orange cocoa-nuts, roots of yam, and\r\ncush-cush, help to make up baskets as varied in colour as the gaudy gowns\r\nand turbans of the women. Neither must the junks of sugar-cane be omitted,\r\nwhich the “coloured” gentlemen and ladies delight to gnaw, walking,\r\nsitting, and standing; increasing thereby the size of their lips, and\r\nbreaking out, often enough, their upper front teeth. Rude health is in\r\ntheir faces; their cheeks literally shine with fatness.\r\n\r\nBut in this happy archipelago there are drawbacks: in the Guadaloupe\r\nearthquake of 1843, 5,000 persons lost their lives in the one town of\r\nPoint-à-Pitre alone. The Souffrière volcano, 5,000 feet high, rears many a\r\npeak to the skies, and shows an ugly and uncertain humour, smoking and\r\nflaming. The writer so often quoted gives a wonderfully beautiful\r\ndescription of this mountain and its surroundings. “As the sun rose, level\r\nlights of golden green streamed round the peak, right and left, over the\r\ndowns; but only for a while. As the sky-clouds vanished in his blazing\r\nrays, earth-clouds rolled up from the valleys behind, wreathed and\r\nweltered about the great black teeth of the crater, and then sinking among\r\nthem and below them, shrouded the whole cone in purple darkness for the\r\nday; while in the foreground blazed in the sunshine broad slopes of\r\ncane-field; below them again the town (the port of Basse Terre), with\r\nhandsome houses, and old-fashioned churches and convents, dating possibly\r\nfrom the seventeenth century, embowered in mangoes, tamarinds, and\r\npalmistes; and along the beach, a market beneath a row of trees, with\r\ncanoes drawn up to be unladen, and gay dresses of every hue. The surf\r\nwhispered softly on the beach. The cheerful murmur of voices came off the\r\nshore, and above it, the tinkling of some little bell, calling good folks\r\nto early mass. A cheery, brilliant picture as man could wish to see, but\r\nmarred by two ugly elements. A mile away on the low northern cliff, marked\r\nwith many a cross, was the lonely cholera cemetery, a remembrance of the\r\nfearful pestilence which, a few years since, swept away thousands of the\r\npeople: and above frowned that black giant, now asleep: but for how long?”\r\n\r\nThe richness of the verdure which clothes these islands to their highest\r\npeaks seems a mere coat of green fur, and yet is often gigantic forest\r\ntrees. The eye wanders over the green abysses, and strains over the wealth\r\nof depths and heights, compared with which fine English parks are mere\r\nshrubberies. There is every conceivable green, or rather of hues, ranging\r\nfrom pale yellow through all greens into cobalt; and “as the wind stirs\r\nthe leaves, and sweeps the lights and shadows over hill and glen, all is\r\never-changing, iridescent, like a peacock’s tail; till the whole island,\r\nfrom peak to shore, seems some glorious jewel—an emerald, with tints of\r\nsapphire and topaz, hanging between blue sea and white surf below, and\r\nblue sky and white cloud above.” And yet, over all this beauty, dark\r\nshadows hang—the shadow of war and the shadow of slavery. These seas have\r\nbeen oft reddened with the blood of gallant sailors, and every other gully\r\nholds the skeleton of an Englishman.\r\n\r\nHere it was that Rodney broke De Grasse’s line, took and destroyed seven\r\nFrench ships of war, and scattered the rest: saving Jamaica, and, in\r\nsooth, the whole West Indies, and bringing about the honourable peace of\r\n1783. Yon lovely roadstead of Dominica: there Rodney caught up with the\r\nFrench just before, and would have beaten them so much the earlier but for\r\nhis vessels being becalmed. In that deep bay at Martinique, now lined with\r\ngay houses, was for many years the Cul-de-sac Royal, the rendezvous and\r\nstronghold of the French fleet. That isolated rock hard by, much the shape\r\nand double the size of the great Pyramids, is Sir Samuel Hood’s famous\r\nDiamond Rock,(112) to which that brave old navigator literally tied with a\r\nhawser or two his ship, the _Centaur_, and turned the rock into a fortress\r\nfrom whence to sweep the seas. The rock was for several months rated on\r\nthe books of the Admiralty as “His Majesty’s Ship, _Diamond Rock_.” She\r\nhad at last to surrender, for want of powder, to an overwhelming force—two\r\nseventy-fours and fourteen smaller ships of war—but did not give in till\r\nseventy poor Frenchmen were lying killed or wounded, and three of their\r\ngun-boats destroyed, her own loss being only two men killed and one\r\nwounded. Brave old sloop of war! And, once more, those glens and forests\r\nof St. Lucia remind us of Sir John Moore and Sir Ralph Abercrombie, who\r\nfought, not merely the French, but the “Brigands”—negroes liberated by the\r\nRevolution of 1792.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: THE _CENTAUR_ AT THE DIAMOND ROCK, MARTINIQUE.]\r\n\r\nBut the good ship must proceed; and as British naval interests are under\r\nconsideration, let her bows be turned to Bermuda—a colony, a fortress and\r\na prison, and where England owns an extensive floating dock, dock-yards,\r\nand workshops.(113) Trollope says that its geological formation is\r\nmysterious. “It seems to be made of soft white stone, composed mostly of\r\nlittle shells—so soft, indeed, that you might cut Bermuda up with a\r\nhand-saw. And people are cutting up Bermuda with hand-saws. One little\r\nisland, that on which the convicts are established, has been altogether so\r\ncut up already. When I visited it, two fat convicts were working away\r\nslowly at the last fragment.” Bermuda is the crater of an extinct volcano,\r\nand is surrounded by little islets, of which there is one for every day of\r\nthe year in a space of twenty by three miles. These are surrounded again\r\nby reefs and rocks, and navigation is risky.\r\n\r\nWere the Bermudas the scene of Ariel’s tricks? They were first discovered,\r\nin 1522, by Bermudez, a Spaniard; and Shakespeare seems to have heard of\r\nthem, for he speaks of the\r\n\r\n  “Still vexed Bermoothes.”\r\n\r\nTrollope says that there is more of the breed of Caliban in the islands\r\nthan of Ariel. Though Caliban did not relish working for his master more\r\nthan the Bermudian of to-day, there was an amount of energy about him\r\nentirely wanting in the existing islanders.\r\n\r\nThere are two towns, St. George and Hamilton, on different islands. The\r\nformer is the head-quarters of the military, and the second that of the\r\ngovernor. It is the summer head-quarters of the admiral of the station.\r\nThe islands are, in general, wonderfully fertile, and will, with any\r\nordinary cultivation, give two crops of many vegetables in the year. It\r\nhas the advantages of the tropics, _plus_ those of more temperate climes.\r\nFor tomatoes, onions, beet-root, sweet potatoes, early potatoes, as well\r\nas all kinds of fruits, from oranges, lemons, and bananas to small\r\nberries, it is not surpassed by any place in the world; while arrowroot is\r\none of its specialities. It is the early market-garden for New York.\r\nShip-building is carried on, as the islands abound in a stunted cedar,\r\ngood for the purpose, when it can be found large enough. The working\r\npopulation are almost all negroes, and are lazy to a degree. But the\r\nwhites are not much better; and the climate is found to produce great\r\nlassitude.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: BERMUDA, FROM GIBBS HILL.]\r\n\r\nIt is the sea round the Bermudas, more than the islands themselves,\r\nperhaps, that give its beauty. Everywhere the water is wonderfully clear\r\nand transparent, while the land is broken up into narrow inlets and\r\nheadlands, and bays and promontories, nooks and corners, running here and\r\nthere in capricious and ever-varying forms. The oleander, with their\r\nbright blossoms, are so abundant, almost to the water’s edge, that the\r\nBermudas might be called the “Oleander Isles.”\r\n\r\nThe Bermuda convict, in Trollope’s time, seemed to be rather better off\r\nthan most English labourers. He had a pound of meat—good meat, too, while\r\nthe Bermudians were tugging at their teeth with tough morsels; he had a\r\npound and three-quarters of bread—more than he wanted; a pound of\r\nvegetables; tea and sugar; a glass of grog per diem; tobacco-money\r\nallowed, and eight hours’ labour. He was infinitely better off than most\r\nsailors of the merchant service.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: THE NORTH ROCK, BERMUDA.]\r\n\r\nSt. George, the military station of the colony, commands the only entrance\r\namong the islands suitable for the passage of large vessels, the narrow\r\nand intricate channel which leads to its land-locked haven being defended\r\nby strong batteries. The lagoons, and passages, and sea canals between the\r\nlittle islands make communication by water as necessary as in Venice.\r\nEvery one keeps a boat or cedar canoe. He will often do his business on\r\none island and have his residence on a second. Mark Twain has a wonderful\r\nfacility for description; and his latest articles, “Random Notes of an\r\nIdle Excursion,” contain a picturesque account of the Bermudas, and more\r\nparticularly of Hamilton, the leading port. He says that he found it a\r\nwonderfully white town, white as marble—snow—flour. “It was,” says he, “a\r\ntown compacted together upon the sides and tops of a cluster of small\r\nhills. Its outlying borders fringed off and thinned away among the cedar\r\nforests, and there was no woody distance of curving coast or leafy islet\r\nsleeping on the dimpled, painted sea but was flecked with shining white\r\npoints—half-concealed houses peeping out of the foliage. * * * There was\r\nan ample pier of heavy masonry; upon this, under shelter, were some\r\nthousands of barrels, containing that product which has carried the fame\r\nof Bermuda to many lands—the potato. With here and there an onion. That\r\nlast sentence is facetious, for they grow at least two onions in Bermuda\r\nto one potato. The onion is the pride and the joy of Bermuda. It is her\r\njewel, her gem of gems. In her conversation, her pulpit, her literature,\r\nit is her most frequent and eloquent figure. In Bermudian metaphor it\r\nstands for perfection—perfection absolute.\r\n\r\n“The Bermudian, weeping over the departed, exhausts praise when he says,\r\n‘He was an onion!’ The Bermudian, extolling the living hero, bankrupts\r\napplause when he says, ‘He is an onion!’ The Bermudian, setting his son\r\nupon the stage of life to dare and do for himself, climaxes all counsel,\r\nsupplication, admonition, comprehends all ambition, when he says, ‘Be an\r\nonion!’” When the steamer arrives at the pier, the first question asked is\r\nnot concerning great war or political news, but concerns only the price of\r\nonions. All the writers agree that for tomatoes, onions, and vegetables\r\ngenerally, the Bermudas are unequalled; they have been called, as noted\r\nbefore, the market-gardens of New York.\r\n\r\nJack who is fortunate enough to be on the West India and North American\r\nStations must be congratulated. “The country roads,” says the clever\r\nwriter above quoted, “curve and wind hither and thither in the\r\ndelightfulest way, unfolding pretty surprises at every turn; billowy\r\nmasses of oleander that seem to float out from behind distant projections,\r\nlike the pink cloud-banks of sunset; sudden plunges among cottages and\r\ngardens, life and activity, followed by as sudden plunges into the sombre\r\ntwilight and stillness of the woods; glittering visions of white\r\nfortresses and beacon towers pictured against the sky on remote hill-tops;\r\nglimpses of shining green sea caught for a moment through opening\r\nheadlands, then lost again; more woods and solitude; and by-and-by another\r\nturn lays bare, without warning, the full sweep of the inland ocean,\r\nenriched with its bars of soft colour, and graced with its wandering\r\nsails.\r\n\r\n“Take any road you please, you may depend upon it you will not stay in it\r\nhalf a mile. Your road is everything that a road ought to be; it is\r\nbordered with trees, and with strange plants and flowers; it is shady and\r\npleasant, or sunny and still pleasant; it carries you by the prettiest and\r\npeacefulest and most home-like of homes, and through stretches of forest\r\nthat lie in a deep hush sometimes, and sometimes are alive with the music\r\nof birds; it curves always, which is a continual promise, whereas straight\r\nroads reveal everything at a glance and kill interest. * * * There is\r\nenough of variety. Sometimes you are in the level open, with marshes,\r\nthick grown with flag-lances that are ten feet high, on the one hand, and\r\npotato and onion orchards on the other; next you are on a hill-top, with\r\nthe ocean and the islands spread around you; presently the road winds\r\nthrough a deep cut, shut in by perpendicular walls thirty or forty feet\r\nhigh, marked with the oddest and abruptest stratum lines, suggestive of\r\nsudden and eccentric old upheavals, and garnished with, here and there, a\r\nclinging adventurous flower, and here and there a dangling vine; and\r\nby-and-by, your way is along the sea edge, and you may look down a fathom\r\nor two through the transparent water and watch the diamond-like flash and\r\nplay of the light upon the rocks and sands on the bottom until you are\r\ntired of it—if you are so constituted as to be able to get tired of it.”\r\n\r\nBut as there are spots in the sun, and the brightest lights throw the\r\ndeepest shadows everywhere; so on the Bermuda coasts there are, in its\r\nrare storms, dangers of no small kind among its numerous reefs and rocks.\r\nThe North Rock, in particular, is the monument which marks the grave of\r\nmany a poor sailor in by-gone days. At the present time, however,\r\ntug-boats, and the use of steam generally, have reduced the perils of\r\nnavigation among the hundreds of islands which constitute the Bermuda\r\ngroup to a minimum.\r\n\r\nThe recent successful trip of Cleopatra’s Needle in a vessel of unique\r\nconstruction will recall that of the Bermuda floating-dock, which it will\r\nbe remembered was towed across the Atlantic and placed in its present\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nBermuda being, from a naval point of view, the most important port on the\r\nNorth American and West Indian Stations, it had long been felt to be an\r\nabsolute necessity that a dock capable of holding the largest vessels of\r\nwar should be built in some part of the island. After many futile attempts\r\nto accomplish this object, owing to the porous nature of the rock of which\r\nthe island is formed, it was determined that Messrs. Campbell, Johnstone &\r\nCo., of North Woolwich, should construct a floating-dock according to\r\ntheir patented inventions: those built by them for Carthagena, Saigon, and\r\nCallao having been completely successful. The dimensions of the dock for\r\nBermuda, which was afterwards named after that island, are as follows:—\r\n\r\nLength over all               381   feet.\r\nLength between caissons       330   „\r\nBreadth over all              124   „\r\nBreadth between sides          84   „\r\nDepth inside                   53   „    5 in.\r\n\r\nShe is divided into eight longitudinal water-tight compartments, and these\r\nagain into sets of compartments, called respectively load on and balance\r\nchambers. Several small compartments were also made for the reception of\r\nthe pumps, the machinery for moving capstans, and cranes, all of which\r\nwere worked by steam. She is powerful and large enough to lift an ironclad\r\nhaving a displacement of 10,400 tons, and could almost dock the _Great\r\nEastern_.\r\n\r\nThe building of the _Bermuda_ was begun in August, 1866; she was launched\r\nin September, 1868, and finally completed in May, 1869. For the purposes\r\nof navigation two light wooden bridges were thrown across her, on the\r\nforemost of which stood her compass, and on the after the steering\r\napparatus. She was also supplied with three lighthouses and several\r\nsemaphores for signalling to the men-of-war which had her in tow, either\r\nby night or day. In shape she is something like a round-bottomed canal\r\nboat with the ends cut off. From an interesting account of her voyage from\r\nSheerness to Bermuda by “One of those on Board,” we gather the following\r\ninformation respecting her trip. Her crew numbered eighty-two hands, under\r\na Staff-Commander, R.N.; there were also on board an assistant naval\r\nsurgeon, an Admiralty commissioner, and the writer of the book from which\r\nthese particulars are taken. The first rendezvous of the _Bermuda_ was to\r\nbe at the Nore.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: THE BERMUDA FLOATING DOCK.]\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 23rd of June, 1869, the _Bermuda_ was towed to the\r\nNore by four ordinary Thames tugs, accompanied by H.M.SS. _Terrible_,\r\n_Medusa_, _Buzzard_, and _Wildfire_. On arriving at the Nore off the\r\nlightship she found the _Northumberland_ waiting for her. The tugs cast\r\noff, and a hawser was passed to the _Northumberland_, which took her in\r\ntow as far as Knob Channel, the _Terrible_ bringing up astern. The\r\n_Agincourt_ was now picked up, and passing a hawser on board the\r\n_Northumberland_, took the lead in the maritime tandem. A hawser was now\r\npassed to the _Terrible_ from the stern of the _Bermuda_, so that by\r\ntowing that vessel she might be kept from swaying from side to side. The\r\n_Medusa_ steamed on the quarter of the _Northumberland_, and the _Buzzard_\r\nacted as a kind of floating outrider to clear the way. The North Foreland\r\nwas passed the same evening, at a speed of four knots an hour. Everything\r\nwent well until the 25th, when she lost sight of land off the Start Point\r\nlate in the afternoon of that day. On the 28th she was half-way across the\r\nBay of Biscay, when, encountering a slight sea and a freshening wind, she\r\nshowed her first tendency to roll, an accomplishment in which she was\r\nafterwards beaten by all her companions, although the prognostications\r\nabout her talents in this direction had been of the most lugubrious\r\ndescription. It must be understood that the bottom of her hold, so to\r\nspeak, was only some ten feet under the surface of the water, and that her\r\nhollow sides towered some sixty feet above it. On the top of each gunwale\r\nwere wooden houses for the officers, with gardens in front and behind, in\r\nwhich mignonette, sweet peas, and other English garden flowers, grew and\r\nflourished, until they encountered the parching heat of the tropics. The\r\ncrew was quartered in the sides of the vessel; and the top of the\r\ngunwales, or quarter-decks, as they might be called, communicated with the\r\nlower decks by means of a ladder fifty-three feet long.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: VOYAGE OF THE “BERMUDA.”]\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to the voyage. Her next rendezvous was at Porto Santo,\r\na small island on the east coast of the island of Madeira. On July 4th,\r\nabout six o’clock in the morning, land was signalled. This proved to be\r\nthe island of Porto Santo; and she brought up about two miles off the\r\nprincipal town early in the afternoon, having made the voyage from\r\nSheerness in exactly eleven days. Here the squadron was joined by the\r\n_Warrior_, _Black Prince_, and _Lapwing_ (gunboat), the _Helicon_ leaving\r\nthem for Lisbon. Towards nightfall they started once more in the following\r\norder, passing to the south of Bermuda. The _Black Prince_ and _Warrior_\r\nled the team, towing the _Bermuda_, the _Terrible_ being towed by her in\r\nturn, to prevent yawing, and the _Lapwing_ following close on the heels of\r\nthe _Terrible_. All went well until the 8th, when the breeze freshened,\r\nthe dock rolling as much as ten degrees. Towards eight o’clock in the\r\nevening a mighty crash was heard, and the whole squadron was brought up by\r\nsignal from the lighthouses. On examination it was found that the\r\n_Bermuda_ had carried away one of the chains of her immense rudder, which\r\nwas swaying to and fro in a most dangerous manner. The officers and men,\r\nhowever, went to work with a will, and by one o’clock the next morning all\r\nwas made snug again, and the squadron proceeded on its voyage. During this\r\nportion of the trip, a line of communication was established between the\r\n_Bermuda_ and the _Warrior_, and almost daily presents of fresh meat and\r\nvegetables were sent by the officers of the ironclad to their unknown\r\ncomrades on board the dock. On the 9th, the day following the disaster to\r\nthe rudder, they fell in with the north-east trade winds, which formed the\r\nsubject of great rejoicing. Signals were made to make all sail, and reduce\r\nthe quantity of coal burned in the boilers of the four steam vessels. The\r\nnext day, the _Lapwing_, being shorter of coal than the others, she was\r\nordered to take the place of the _Terrible_, the latter ship now taking\r\nthe lead by towing the _Black Prince_. The _Lapwing_, however, proved not\r\nto be sufficiently powerful for this service. A heavy sea springing up,\r\nthe dock began to yaw and behave so friskily that the squadron once more\r\nbrought to, and the old order of things was resumed.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th the _Lapwing_ was sent on ahead to Bermuda to inform the\r\nauthorities of the close advent of the dock. It was now arranged that as\r\nthe _Terrible_ drew less water than any of the other ships, she should\r\nhave the honour of piloting the dock through the Narrows—a narrow,\r\ntortuous, and shallow channel, forming the only practicable entrance for\r\nlarge ships to the harbour of Bermuda. On the morning of the 28th, Bermuda\r\nlighthouse was sighted, and the _Spitfire_ was shortly afterwards picked\r\nup, having been sent by the Bermudan authorities to pilot the squadron as\r\nfar as the entrance of the Narrows. She also brought the intelligence that\r\nit had been arranged that the _Viper_ and the _Vixen_ had been ordered to\r\npilot the dock into harbour. As they neared Bermuda, the squadron were met\r\nby the naval officer in charge of the station, who, after having had\r\ninterviews with the captains of the squadron and of the _Bermuda_,\r\nrescinded the order respecting the _Vixen_ and the _Viper_, and the\r\n_Terrible_ was once more deputed to tow the _Bermuda_ through the Narrows.\r\nJust off the mouth of this dangerous inlet, the _Bermuda_ being in tow of\r\nthe _Terrible_ only, the dock became uncontrollable, and would have done\r\nher best to carry Her Majesty’s ship to Halifax had not the _Warrior_ come\r\nto her aid, after the _Spitfire_ and _Lapwing_ had tried ineffectually to\r\nbe of assistance.\r\n\r\nBy this time, however, the water in the Narrows had become too low for the\r\n_Warrior_; the _Bermuda_ had, therefore, to wait until high water next\r\nmorning in order to complete the last, and, as it proved, the most\r\nperilous part of her journey. After the _Warrior_ and the _Terrible_ had\r\ntowed the dock through the entrance of the inlet, the first-named ship\r\ncast off. The dock once more became unmanageable through a sudden gust of\r\nwind striking her on the quarter. Had the gust lasted for only a few\r\nseconds longer, the dock would have stranded—perhaps for ever. She\r\nrighted, however, and the _Terrible_ steaming hard ahead, she passed the\r\nmost dangerous point of the inlet, and at last rode securely in smooth\r\nwater, within a few cables’ length of her future berth, after a singularly\r\nsuccessful voyage of thirty-six days.\r\n\r\nIt says much for the naval and engineering skill of all concerned in the\r\ntransport of this unwieldy mass of iron, weighing 8,000 tons, over nearly\r\n4,000 miles of ocean, without the loss of a single life, or, indeed, a\r\nsolitary accident that can be called serious. The conception, execution,\r\nand success of the project are wholly unparalleled in the history of naval\r\nengineering.\r\n\r\nLeaving Bermuda, whither away? To the real capital of America, New York.\r\nIt is true that English men-of-war, and, for the matter of that, vessels\r\nof the American navy, comparatively seldom visit that port, which\r\notherwise is crowded by the shipping of all nations. There are reasons for\r\nthis. New York has not to-day a dock worthy of the name; magnificent\r\nsteamships and palatial ferry-boats all lie alongside wharfs, or enter\r\n“slips,” which are semi-enclosed wharfs. Brooklyn and Jersey City have,\r\nhowever, docks.\r\n\r\nWho that has visited New York will ever forget his first impressions? The\r\ngrand Hudson, or the great East River, itself a strait: the glorious bay,\r\nor the crowded island, alike call for and deserve enthusiastic admiration.\r\nIf one arrives on a sunny day, maybe not a zephyr agitates the surface of\r\nthe noble Hudson, or even the bay itself: the latter landlocked, save\r\nwhere lost in the broad Atlantic; the former skirted by the great Babylon\r\nof America and the wooded banks of Hoboken. Round the lofty western hills,\r\na fleet of small craft—with rakish hulls and snowy sails—steal quietly and\r\nsoftly, while steamboats, that look like floating islands, almost pass\r\nthem with lightning speed. Around is the shipping of every clime; enormous\r\nferry-boats radiating in all directions; forests of masts along the wharfs\r\nbearing the flags of all nations. And where so much is strange, there is\r\none consoling fact: you feel yourself at home. You are among brothers,\r\nspeaking the same language, obeying the same laws, professing the same\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: MAP OF NEW YORK HARBOUR.]\r\n\r\nNew York city and port of entry, New York county, State of New York, lies\r\nat the head of New York Bay, so that there is a good deal of New York\r\nabout it. It is the commercial emporium of the United States, and if it\r\never has a rival, it will be on the other side of the continent, somewhere\r\nnot far from San Francisco. Its area is, practically, the bulk of\r\nManhattan or New York Island, say thirteen miles long by two wide. Its\r\nseparation from the mainland is caused by the Harlem River, which connects\r\nthe Hudson and East Rivers, and is itself spanned by a bridge and the\r\nCroton aqueduct. New York really possesses every advantage required to\r\nbuild a grand emporium. It extends between two rivers, each navigable for\r\nthe largest vessels, while its harbour would contain the united or\r\ndisunited navies, as the case may be, of all nations. The Hudson River, in\r\nparticular, is for some distance up a mile or more in width, while the\r\nEast River averages over two-fifths of a mile. The population of New York,\r\nwith its suburban appendages, including the cities of Brooklyn and Jersey\r\nCity, is not less than that of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe harbour is surrounded with small settlements, connected by\r\ncharmingly-situated villas and country residences. It is toward its\r\nnorthern end that the masts, commencing with a few stragglers, gradually\r\nthicken to a forest. In it are three fortified islands. By the strait\r\ncalled the “Narrows,” seven miles from the lower part of the city, and\r\nwhich is, for the space of a mile, about one mile wide, it communicates\r\nwith the outer harbour, or bay proper, which extends thence to Sandy Hook\r\nLight, forty miles from the city, and opens directly into the ocean,\r\nforming one of the best roadsteads on the whole Atlantic coasts of\r\nAmerica. The approach to the city, as above indicated, is very fine, the\r\nshores of the bay being wooded down to the water’s edge, and thickly\r\nstudded with villages, farms, and country seats. The view of the city\r\nitself is not so prepossessing; like all large cities, it is almost\r\nimpossible to find a point from which to grasp the grandeur in its\r\nentirety, and the ground on which it is built is nowhere elevated.\r\nTherefore there is very little to strike the eye specially. Many a petty\r\ntown makes a greater show in this respect.\r\n\r\nThose ferry-boats! The idea in the minds of most Englishmen is associated\r\nwith boats that may pass over from one or two to a dozen or so people,\r\npossibly a single horse, or a donkey-cart. There you find steamers a\r\ncouple of hundred or more feet long, with, on either side of the engines,\r\ntwenty or more feet space. On the true deck there is accommodation for\r\ncarriages, carts, and horses by the score; above, a spacious saloon for\r\npassengers. They have powerful engines, and will easily beat the average\r\nsteamship. On arrival at the dock, they run into a kind of slip, or basin,\r\nwith piles around stuck in the soft bottom, which yield should she strike\r\nthem, and entirely do away with any fear of concussion. “I may here add,”\r\nnotes an intelligent writer,(114) “that during my whole travels in the\r\nStates, I found nothing more perfect in construction and arrangement than\r\nthe ferries and their boats, the charges for which are most moderate,\r\nvarying according to distances, and ranging from one halfpenny upwards.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor ashore in New York—and how many, many thousands visit it every\r\nyear!—will find much to note. The public buildings of the great city are\r\nnot remarkable; but the one great street, Broadway, which is about eight\r\nmiles long, and almost straight, is a very special feature. Unceasing\r\nthrongs of busy men and women, loungers and idlers, vehicles of all kinds,\r\nstreet cars, omnibuses, and carriages—there are no cabs hardly in New\r\nYork—pass and re-pass from early morn to dewy eve, while the shops, always\r\ncalled “stores,” rival those of the Boulevards or Regent Street. Some of\r\nthe older streets were, no doubt, as Washington Irving tells us, laid out\r\nafter the old cow-paths, as they are as narrow and tortuous as those of\r\nany European city. The crowded state of Broadway at certain points rivals\r\nCheapside. The writer saw in 1867 a light bridge, which spanned the\r\nstreet, and was intended for the use of ladies and timid pedestrians.\r\nWhen, in 1869, he re-passed through the city it had disappeared, and on\r\ninquiry he learnt the reason. Unprincipled roughs had stationed themselves\r\nat either end, and levied black-mail toll on old ladies and\r\nunsophisticated country-people.\r\n\r\nSo extreme is the difference between the intense heat of summer and the\r\nequally intense cold of winter in New York, that the residents regularly\r\nget thin in the former and stout in the latter. And what a sight are the\r\ntwo rivers at that time! Huge masses of ice, crashing among themselves,\r\nand making navigation perilous and sometimes impossible, descending the\r\nstream at a rapid rate; docks and slips frozen in; the riggings and\r\nshrouds of great ships covered with icicles, and the decks ready for\r\nimmediate use as skating-rinks. The writer crossed in the ferry-boat from\r\nJersey City to New York, in January, 1875, and acquired a sincere respect\r\nfor the pilot, who wriggled and zig-zagged his vessel through masses of\r\nice, against which a sharp collision would not have been a joke. When, on\r\nthe following morning, he left for Liverpool, the steamship herself was a\r\ngood model for a twelfth-night cake ornament, and had quite enough to do\r\nto get out from the wharf. Five days after, in mid-Atlantic, he was\r\nsitting on deck in the open air, reading a book, so much milder at such\r\ntimes is it on the open ocean.\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: BROOKLYN BRIDGE.]\r\n\r\nBut our leave is over, and although it would be pleasant to travel in\r\nimaginative company up the beautiful Hudson, and visit one of the wonders\r\nof the world—Niagara, to-day a mere holiday excursion from New York—we\r\nmust away, merely briefly noting before we go another of the wonders of\r\nthe world, a triumph of engineering skill: the great Brooklyn bridge,\r\nwhich connects that city with New York. Its span is about three-quarters\r\nof a mile; large ships can pass under it, while vehicles and pedestrians\r\ncross in mid-air over their mast tops, between two great cities, making\r\nthem one. Brooklyn is a great place for the residences of well-to-do New\r\nYorkers, and the view from its “Heights”—an elevation covered with villas\r\nand mansions—is grand and extensive. Apart from this, Brooklyn is a\r\nconsiderable city, with numerous churches and chapels, public buildings,\r\nand places of amusement.\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: FERRY-BOAT, NEW YORK HARBOUR.]\r\n\r\nHalifax is the northernmost depôt of the whole West India and North\r\nAmerican Station, and is often a great rendezvous of the Royal Navy. It is\r\nsituated on a peninsula on the south-east coast of Nova Scotia, of which\r\nit is the capital. Its situation is very picturesque. The town stands on\r\nthe declivity of a hill about 250 feet high, rising from one of the finest\r\nharbours in the world. The city front is lined with handsome wharfs, while\r\nmerchants’ houses, dwellings, and public edifices arrange themselves on\r\ntiers, stretching along and up the sides of the hill. It has fine wide\r\nstreets; the principal one, which runs round the edge of the harbour, is\r\ncapitally paved. The harbour opposite the town, where ships usually\r\nanchor, is rather more than a mile wide, and after narrowing to a quarter\r\nof a mile above the upper end of the town, expands into Bedford Basin, a\r\ncompletely land-locked sheet of water. This grand sea-lake has an area of\r\nten square miles, and is capable of containing any number of navies.\r\nHalifax possesses another advantage not common to every harbour of North\r\nAmerica: it is accessible at all seasons, and navigation is rarely impeded\r\nby ice. There are two fine lighthouses at Halifax; that on an island off\r\nSambro Head is 210 feet high. The port possesses many large ships of its\r\nown, generally employed in the South Sea whale and seal fishery. It is a\r\nvery prosperous fishing town in other respects.\r\n\r\nThe town of Halifax was founded in 1749. The settlers, to the number of\r\n3,500, largely composed of naval and military men, whose expenses out had\r\nbeen paid by the British Government to assist in the formation of the\r\nstation, soon cleared the ground from stumps, &c., and having erected a\r\nwooden government house and suitable warehouses for stores and provisions,\r\nthe town was laid out so as to form a number of straight and handsome\r\nstreets. Planks, doors, window-frames, and other portions of houses, were\r\nimported from the New England settlements, and the more laborious portion\r\nof the work, which the settlers executed themselves, was performed with\r\ngreat dispatch. At the approach of winter they found themselves\r\ncomfortably settled, having completed a number of houses and huts, and\r\ncovered others in a manner which served to protect them from the rigour of\r\nthe weather, there very severe. There were now assembled at Halifax about\r\n5,000 people, whose labours were suddenly suspended by the intensity of\r\nthe frost, and there was in consequence considerable enforced idleness.\r\nHaliburton(115) mentions the difficulty that the governor had to employ\r\nthe settlers by sending them out on various expeditions, in palisading the\r\ntown, and in other public works.\r\n\r\nIn addition to £40,000 granted by the British Government for the\r\nembarkation and other expenses of the first settlers, Parliament continued\r\nto make annual grants for the same purpose, which, in 1755, amounted to\r\nthe considerable sum of £416,000.\r\n\r\nThe town of Halifax was no sooner built than the French colonists began to\r\nbe alarmed, and although they did not think proper to make an open avowal\r\nof their jealousy and disgust, they employed their emissaries\r\nclandestinely in exciting the Indians to harass the inhabitants with\r\nhostilities, in such a manner as should effectually hinder them from\r\nextending their plantations, or perhaps, indeed, induce them to abandon\r\nthe settlement. The Indian chiefs, however, for some time took a different\r\nview of the matter, waited upon the governor, and acknowledged themselves\r\nsubjects of the crown of England. The French court thereupon renewed its\r\nintrigues with the Indians, and so far succeeded that for several years\r\nthe town was frequently attacked in the night, and the English could not\r\nstir into the adjoining woods without the danger of being shot, scalped,\r\nor taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nAmong the early laws of Nova Scotia was one by which it was enacted that\r\nno debts contracted in England, or in any of the colonies prior to the\r\nsettlement of Halifax, or to the arrival of the debtor, should be\r\nrecoverable by law in any court in the province. As an asylum for\r\ninsolvent debtors, it is natural to suppose that Halifax attracted thither\r\nthe guilty as well as the unfortunate; and we may form some idea of the\r\nstate of public morals at that period from an order of Governor\r\nCornwallis, which, after reciting that the dead were usually attended to\r\nthe grave by neither relatives or friends, twelve citizens should in\r\nfuture be summoned to attend the funeral of each deceased person.\r\n\r\nThe Nova Scotians are popularly known by Canadians and Americans as “Blue\r\nNoses,” doubtless from the colour of their nasal appendages in bitter cold\r\nweather. It has been already mentioned that Halifax is now a thriving\r\ncity; but there must have been a period when the people were not\r\nparticularly enterprising, or else that most veracious individual, “Sam\r\nSlick,” greatly belied them. Judge Haliburton, in his immortal\r\n“Clockmaker,” introduces the following conversation with Mr. Slick:—\r\n\r\n“‘You appear,’ said I to Mr. Slick, ‘to have travelled over the whole of\r\nthis province, and to have observed the country and the people with much\r\nattention; pray, what is your opinion of the present state and future\r\nprospects of Halifax?’ ‘If you will tell me,’ said he, ‘when the folks\r\nthere will wake up, then I can answer you; but they are fast asleep. As to\r\nthe province, it’s a splendid province, and calculated to go ahead; it\r\nwill grow as fast as a Virginny gall—and they grow so amazing fast, if you\r\nput one of your arms round one of their necks to kiss them, by the time\r\nyou’ve done they’ve growed up into women. It’s a pretty province, I tell\r\nyou, good above and better below: surface covered with pastures, meadows,\r\nwoods, and a nation sight of water privileges; and under the ground full\r\nof mines. It puts me in mind of the soup at _Tree_mont house—good enough\r\nat top, but dip down and you have the riches—the coal, the iron ore, the\r\ngypsum, and what not. As for Halifax, it’s well enough in itself, though\r\nno great shakes neither; a few sizeable houses, with a proper sight of\r\nsmall ones, like half-a-dozen old hens with their broods of young\r\nchickens: but the people, the strange critters, they are all asleep. They\r\nwalk in their sleep, and talk in their sleep, and what they say one day\r\nthey forget the next; they say they were dreaming.’” This was first\r\npublished in England in 1838; all accounts now speak of Halifax as a\r\nwell-built, paved, and cleanly city, and of its inhabitants as\r\nenterprising.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: THE ISLAND OF ASCENSION.]\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: TRISTAN D’ACUNHA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ROUND THE WORLD ON A MAN-OF-WAR (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE AFRICAN STATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Its Extent—Ascension—Turtle at a Discount—Sierra Leone—An\r\n      Unhealthy Station—The Cape of Good Hope—Cape Town—Visit of the\r\n     Sailor Prince—Grand Festivities—Enthusiasm of the Natives—Loyal\r\n    Demonstrations—An African “Derby”—Grand Dock Inaugurated—Elephant\r\n      Hunting—The Parting Ball—The Life of a Boer—Circular Farms—The\r\n    Diamond Discoveries—A £12,000 Gem—A Sailor First President of the\r\n    Fields—Precarious Nature of the Search—Natal—Inducements held out\r\n     to Settlers—St. Helena and Napoleon—Discourteous Treatment of a\r\n                  Fallen Foe—The Home of the Caged Lion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now we are off to the last of the British naval stations under\r\nconsideration—that of the African coast. It is called, in naval\r\nphraseology, “The West Coast of Africa and Cape of Good Hope Station,” and\r\nembraces not merely all that the words imply, but a part of the east\r\ncoast, including the important colony of Natal. Commencing at latitude 20°\r\nN. above the Cape Verd Islands, it includes the islands of Ascension, St.\r\nHelena, Tristan d’Acunha, and others already described.\r\n\r\nAscension, which is a British station, with dockyard, and fort garrisoned\r\nby artillery and marines, is a barren island, about eight miles long by\r\nsix broad. Its fort is in lat. 70° 26’ N.: long., 140° 24’ W. It is of\r\nvolcanic formation, and one of its hills rises to the considerable\r\nelevation of 2,870 feet. Until the imprisonment of Napoleon at St. Helena,\r\nit was utterly uninhabited. At that period it was garrisoned with a small\r\nBritish force; and so good use was made of their time that it has been\r\npartly cultivated and very greatly improved. Irrigation was found, as\r\nelsewhere, to work wonders, and as there are magnificent springs, this was\r\nrendered easy. Vast numbers of turtle are taken on its shores; and, in\r\nconsequence, the soldiers prefer the soup of pea, and affect to despise\r\nturtle steaks worth half a guinea apiece in London, and fit to rejoice the\r\nheart of an alderman! The writer saw the same thing in Vancouver Island,\r\nwhere at the boarding-house of a very large steam saw-mill, the hands\r\nstruck against the salmon, so abundant on those coasts. They insisted upon\r\nnot having it more than twice a week for dinner, and that it should be\r\nreplaced by salt pork. The climate of Ascension is remarkably healthy. The\r\nobject in occupying it is very similar to the reason for holding the\r\nFalkland Islands—to serve as a depôt for stores, coal, and for watering\r\nships cruising in the South Atlantic.\r\n\r\nSierra Leone is, perhaps, of all places in the world, the last to which\r\nthe sailor would wish to go, albeit its unhealthiness has been, as is the\r\ncase with Panama, grossly exaggerated. Thus we were told that when a\r\nclergyman with some little influence was pestering the Prime Minister for\r\nthe time being for promotion, the latter would appoint him to the\r\nBishopric of Sierra Leone, knowing well that in a year or so the said\r\nbishopric would be vacant and ready for another gentleman!\r\n\r\n                      [Illustration: SIERRA LEONE.]\r\n\r\nSierra Leone is a British colony, and the capital is Free Town, situated\r\non a peninsula lying between the broad estuary of the Sherboro and the\r\nSierra Leone rivers, connected with the mainland by an isthmus not more\r\nthan one mile and a half broad. The colony also includes a number of\r\nislands, among which are many good harbours. Its history has one\r\ninteresting point. When, in 1787, it became a British colony, a company\r\nwas formed, which included a scheme for making it a home for free negroes,\r\nand to prove that colonial produce could be raised profitably without\r\nresorting to slave labour. Its prosperity was seriously affected during\r\nthe French Revolution by the depredations of French cruisers, and in 1808\r\nthe company ceded all its rights to the Crown. Its population includes\r\nnegroes from 200 different African tribes, many of them liberated from\r\nslavery and slave-ships, a subject which will be treated hereafter in this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nOne of the great industries of Sierra Leone is the manufacture of\r\ncocoa-nut oil. The factories are extensive affairs. It is a very beautiful\r\ncountry, on the whole, and when acclimatised, Europeans find that they can\r\nlive splendidly on the products of the country. The fisheries, both sea\r\nand river, are wonderfully productive, and employ about 1,500 natives.\r\nBoat-building is carried on to some extent, the splendid forests yielding\r\ntimber so large that canoes capable of holding a hundred men have been\r\nmade from a single log, like those already mentioned in connection with\r\nthe north-west coast of America. Many of the West Indian products have\r\nbeen introduced; sugar, coffee, indigo, ginger, cotton, and rice thrive\r\nwell, as do Indian corn, the yam, plantain, pumpkins, banana, cocoa,\r\nbaobab, pine-apple, orange, lime, guava, papaw, pomegranate, orange, and\r\nlime. Poultry is particularly abundant. It therefore might claim attention\r\nas a fruitful and productive country but for the malaria of its swampy\r\nrivers and low lands.\r\n\r\nAnd now, leaving Sierra Leone, our good ship makes for the Cape of Good\r\nHope, passing, mostly far out at sea, down that coast along which the\r\nPortuguese mariners crept so cautiously yet so surely till Diaz and Da\r\nGama reached South Africa, while the latter showed them the way to the\r\nfabled Cathaia, the Orient—India, China, and the Spice Islands.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1486 “The Cape” of capes _par excellence_, which rarely\r\nnowadays bears its full title, was discovered by Bartholomew de Diaz, a\r\ncommander in the service of John II. of Portugal. He did not proceed to\r\nthe eastward of it, and it was reserved for the great Vasco da\r\nGama—afterwards the first Viceroy of India—an incident in whose career\r\nforms, by-the-by, the plot of _L’Africaine_, Meyerbeer’s grand opera, to\r\ndouble it. It was called at first Cabo Tormentoso—“the Cape of Storms”—but\r\nby royal desire was changed to that of “Buon Esperanza”—“Good Hope”—the\r\ntitle it still bears. Cape Colony was acquired by Great Britain in 1620,\r\nalthough for a long time it was practically in the hands of the Dutch, a\r\ncolony having been planted by their East India Company. The Dutch held it\r\nin this way till 1795, when the territory was once more taken by our\r\ncountry. It was returned to the Dutch at the Peace of Amiens, only to be\r\nsnatched from them again in 1806, and finally confirmed to Britain at the\r\ngeneral peace of 1815.\r\n\r\nThe population, including the Boers, or farmers of Dutch descent,\r\nHottentots, Kaffirs, and Malays, is not probably over 600,000, while the\r\noriginal territory is about 700 miles long by 400 wide, having an area of\r\nnot far from 200,000 square miles. The capital of the colony is Cape Town,\r\nlying at the foot, as every schoolboy knows, of the celebrated Table\r\nMountain.\r\n\r\nA recent writer, Mr. Boyle,(116) speaks cautiously of Cape Town and its\r\npeople. There are respectable, but not very noticeable, public buildings.\r\n“Some old Dutch houses there are, distinguishable chiefly by a superlative\r\nflatness and an extra allowance of windows. The population is about 30,000\r\nsouls, white, black, and mixed. I should incline to think more than half\r\nfall into the third category. They seem to be hospitable and good-natured\r\nin all classes.... There is complaint of slowness, indecision, and general\r\n‘want of go’ about the place. Dutch blood is said to be still too apparent\r\nin business, in local government, and in society. I suppose there is sound\r\nbasis for these accusations, since trade is migrating so rapidly towards\r\nthe rival mart of Port Elizabeth.... But ten years ago the entire export\r\nof wool passed through Cape Town. Last year, as I find in the official\r\nreturns, 28,000,000 lbs. were shipped at the eastern port out of the whole\r\n37,000,000 lbs. produced in the colony. The gas-lamps, put up by a sort of\r\n_coup d’état_ in the municipality, were not lighted until last year, owing\r\nto the opposition of the Dutch town councillors. They urged that decent\r\npeople didn’t want to be out at night, and the ill-disposed didn’t deserve\r\nillumination. Such facts seem to show that the city is not quite up to the\r\nmark in all respects.”\r\n\r\nSimon’s Bay, near Table Bay, where Cape Town is situated, is a great\r\nrendezvous for the navy; there are docks and soldiers there, and a small\r\ntown. The bay abounds in fish. The Rev. John Milner, chaplain of the\r\n_Galatea_, says that during the visit of Prince Alfred, “large shoals of\r\nfish (a sort of coarse mackerel) were seen all over the bay; numbers came\r\nalongside, and several of them were harpooned with grains by some of the\r\nyoungsters from the accommodation-ladder. Later in the day a seal rose,\r\nand continued fishing and rising in the most leisurely manner. At one time\r\nit was within easy rifle distance, and might have been shot from the\r\nship.”(117) Fish and meat are so plentiful in the colony that living is\r\nexcessively cheap.\r\n\r\n                        [Illustration: CAPE TOWN.]\r\n\r\nThe visit of his Royal Highness the Sailor Prince, in 1867, will long be\r\nremembered in the colony. That, and the recent diamond discoveries, prove\r\nthat the people cannot be accused of sloth and want of enterprise. On\r\narrival at Simon’s Bay, the first vessels made out were the _Racoon_, on\r\nwhich Prince Alfred had served his time as lieutenant, the _Petrel_, just\r\nreturned from landing poor Livingstone at the Zambesi, and the\r\nreceiving-ship _Seringapatam_. Soon followed official visits, dinner,\r\nball, and fireworks from the ships. When the Prince was to proceed to Cape\r\nTown, all the ships fired a royal salute, and the fort also, as he landed\r\nat the jetty, where he was received by a guard of honour of the 99th\r\nRegiment. A short distance from the landing-place, at the entrance to the\r\nmain street, was a pretty arch, decorated with flowering shrubs, and the\r\nleaves of the silver-tree. On his way to this his Royal Highness was met\r\nby a deputation from the inhabitants of Simon’s Town and of the Malay\r\npopulation. “This was a very interesting sight; the chief men, dressed in\r\nOriental costumes, with bright-coloured robes and turbans, stood in front,\r\nand two of them held short wands decorated with paper flowers of various\r\ncolours. The Duke shook hands with them, and then they touched him with\r\ntheir wands. They seemed very much pleased, and looked at him in an\r\nearnest and affectionate manner. Several of the Malays stood round with\r\ndrawn swords, apparently acting as a guard of honour. The crowd round\r\nformed a very motley group of people of all colours—negroes, brown\r\nAsiatics, Hottentots, and men, women, and children of every hue. The\r\npolicemen had enough to do to keep them back as they pressed up close\r\nround the Duke.” After loyal addresses had been received, and responded\r\nto, the Prince and suite drove off for Cape Town, the ride to which is\r\ngraphically described by the chaplain and artist of the expedition. “The\r\nmorning was very lovely. Looking to seaward was the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nCape Hanglip, and the high, broken shores of Hottentot Holland, seen over\r\nthe clear blue water of the bay. The horses, carriages, escort with their\r\ndrawn swords, all dashing at a rattling pace along the sands in the bright\r\nsunshine, and the long lines of small breakers on the beach, was one of\r\nthe most exhilarating sights imaginable. In places the cavalcade emerged\r\nfrom the sands up on to where the road skirts a rocky shore, and where at\r\nthis season of the year beautiful arum lilies and other bright flowers\r\nwere growing in the greatest profusion. About four miles from Simon’s Bay,\r\nwe passed a small cove, called Fish-hook Bay, where a few families of\r\nMalay fishermen reside. A whale they had killed in the bay the evening\r\nbefore lay anchored ready for ‘cutting in.’ A small flag, called by\r\nwhalers a ‘whiff,’ was sticking up in it. We could see from the road that\r\nit was one of the usual southern ‘right’ whales which occasionally come\r\ninto Simon’s Bay, and are captured there. After crossing the last of the\r\nsands, we reached Kalk Bay, a collection of small houses where the people\r\nfrom Cape Town come to stay in the summer. As we proceeded, fresh\r\ncarriages of private individuals and horsemen continued to join on behind,\r\nand it was necessary to keep a bright look-out to prevent them rushing in\r\nbetween the two carriages containing the Duke and Governor, with their\r\nsuites. Various small unpretending arches (every poor man having put up\r\none on his own account), with flags and flowers, spanned the road in\r\ndifferent places between Simon’s Town and Farmer Peck’s, a small inn about\r\nnine miles from the anchorage, which used formerly to have the following\r\neccentric sign-board:—\r\n\r\n    ‘THE GENTLE SHEPHERD OF SALISBURY PLAIN.\r\n\r\n      ‘FARMER PECKS.\r\n\r\n  ‘Multum in Parvo! Pro bono publico!\r\n  Entertainment for man or beast, all of a row,\r\n  Lekher kost, as much as you please;\r\n  Excellent beds, without any fleas.\r\n  Nos patriam fugimus! now we are here,\r\n  Vivamus! let us live by selling beer.\r\n  On donne à boire et à manger ici;\r\n  Come in and try it, whoever you be.’\r\n\r\nThis house was decorated with evergreens, and over the door was a stuffed\r\nSouth African leopard springing on an antelope. A little further on, after\r\ndiscussing lunch at a half-way house, a goodly number of volunteer\r\ncavalry, in blue-and-white uniforms, appeared to escort the Sailor Prince\r\ninto Cape Town. The road passes through pleasant country; but the thick\r\nred dust which rose as the cavalcade proceeded was overwhelming. It was a\r\nSouth African version of the ‘Derby’ on a hot summer’s day. At various\r\nplaces parties of school-children, arrayed along the road-side, sung the\r\nNational Anthem in little piping voices, the singing being generally\r\nconducted by mild-looking men in black gloves and spectacles. At one place\r\nstood an old Malay, playing ‘God Save the Queen’ on a cracked clarionet,\r\nwho, quite absorbed as he was in his music, and apparently unconscious of\r\nall around him, looked exceedingly comic. There was everywhere a great\r\nscrambling crowd of Malays and black boys, running and tumbling over each\r\nother, shouting and laughing; women with children tied on their backs, old\r\nmen, and girls dressed in every conceivable kind of ragged rig and\r\npicturesque colour, with head-gear of a wonderful nature, huge Malay hats,\r\nalmost parasols in size, and resembling the thatch of an English\r\ncorn-rick; crowns of old black hats; turbans of all proportions and\r\ncolours, swelled the procession as it swept along. When the\r\ncavalry-trumpet sounded ‘trot,’ the cloud of dust increased tenfold.\r\nEverybody, apparently, who could muster a horse was mounted, so that ahead\r\nand on every side the carriage in which we were following the Duke was\r\nhemmed in and surrounded, and everything became mixed up in one thick\r\ncloud of red dust, in which helmets, swords, hats, puggeries, turbans, and\r\nhorses almost disappeared. The crowd hurraed louder than ever, pigs\r\nsquealed, dogs howled, riders tumbled off; the excitement was\r\nirresistible. ‘Oh! this is fun; stand up—never mind dignity. Whoo-whoop!’\r\nand we were rushed into the cloud of dust, to escape being utterly swamped\r\nand left astern of the Duke, standing up in the carriage, and holding on\r\nin front, to catch what glimpses we could of what was going on.... Some of\r\nthe arches were very beautiful; they were all decorated with flowering\r\nshrubs, flowers (particularly the arum lily) and leaves of the\r\nsilver-tree. In one the words WELCOME BACK(118) were formed with oranges.\r\nOne of the most curious had on its top a large steamship, with _Galatea_\r\ninscribed upon it, and a funnel out of which real smoke was made to issue\r\nas the Duke passed under. Six little boys dressed as sailors formed the\r\ncrew, and stood up singing ‘Rule Britannia.’” And so they arrived in Cape\r\nTown, to have _levées_, receptions, entertainments, and balls by the\r\ndozen.\r\n\r\nWhile at the Cape the Duke of Edinburgh laid the foundation of a grand\r\ngraving-dock, an adjunct to the Table Bay Harbour Works, a most valuable\r\nand important addition to the resources of the Royal Navy, enabling the\r\nlargest ironclad to be repaired at that distant point. The dock is four\r\nhundred feet long, and ninety feet wide. For more than forty years\r\npreviously frequent but unsuccessful efforts had been made to provide a\r\nharbour of refuge in Table Bay; now, in addition to this splendid dock, it\r\nhas a fine breakwater.\r\n\r\nOfficers of the Royal Navy may occasionally get the opportunity afforded\r\nthe Prince, of attending an elephant hunt. From the neighbourhood of the\r\nCape itself the biggest of beasts has long retired; but three hundred\r\nmiles up the coast, at Featherbed Bay, where there is a settlement, it is\r\nstill possible to enjoy some sport.\r\n\r\nTo leave the port or town of Knysna—where, by-the-by, the Duke was\r\nentertained at a great feed of South African oysters—was found to be\r\ndifficult and perilous. The entrance to the harbour is very fine; a high\r\ncliff comes down sheer to the sea on one side, while on the other there is\r\nan angular bluff, with a cave through it. As the _Petrel_ steamed out, a\r\nlarge group of the ladies of the district waved their handkerchiefs, and\r\nthe elephant-hunters cheered. It was now evident, from the appearance of\r\nthe bar, that the _Petrel_ had not come out a moment too soon. A heavy sea\r\nof rollers extended nearly the whole way across the mouth of the harbour,\r\nand broke into a long thundering crest of foam, leaving only one small\r\nspace on the western side clear of actual surf. For this opening the\r\n_Petrel_ steered; but even there the swell was so great that the vessel\r\nreared and pitched fearfully, and touched the bottom as she dipped astern\r\ninto the deep trough of the sea. The slightest accident to the rudder, and\r\nnothing short of a miracle could have saved them from going on to the\r\nrocks, where a tremendous surf was breaking. Providentially, she got out\r\nsafely, and soon the party was transferred to the _Racoon_, which returned\r\nto Simon’s Bay.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: THE “GALATEA” PASSING KNYSNA HEADS.]\r\n\r\nOn his return from the elephant hunt, the Prince gave a parting ball. A\r\ncapital ballroom, 135 feet long by 44 wide, was improvised out of an open\r\nboat-house by a party of blue-jackets, who, by means of ships’ lanterns,\r\nflags, arms arranged as ornaments, and beautiful ferns and flowers,\r\neffected a transformation as wonderful as anything recorded in the\r\n“Arabian Nights,” the crowning feature of the decorations being the head\r\nof one of the elephants from the Knysna, surmounting an arch of\r\nevergreens. Most of the visitors had to come all the way from Cape Town,\r\nand during the afternoon were to be seen flocking along the sands in\r\nvehicles of every description, many being conveyed to Simon’s Town a part\r\nof the distance in a navy steam-tender or the _Galatea’s_ steam-launch.\r\nThe ball was, of course, a grand success.\r\n\r\nThis not being a history of Cape Colony, but rather of what the sailor\r\nwill find at or near its ports and harbours, the writer is relieved from\r\nany necessity of treating on past or present troubles with the Boers or\r\nthe natives. Of course, everything was tinted _couleur de rose_ at the\r\nPrince’s visit, albeit at that very time the colony was in a bad way, with\r\nover speculation among the commercial classes, a cattle plague, disease\r\namong sheep, and a grape-disease. Mr. Frederick Boyle, whose recent work\r\non the Diamond-fields has been already quoted, and who had to leave a\r\nsteamer short of coal at Saldanha Bay, seventy or eighty miles from Cape\r\nTown, and proceed by a rather expensive route, presents a picture far from\r\ngratifying of some of the districts through which he passed. At Saldanha\r\nBay agriculture gave such poor returns that it did not even pay to export\r\nproduce to the Cape. The settlers _exist_, but can hardly be said to live.\r\nThey have plenty of cattle and sheep, sufficient maize and corn, but\r\nlittle money. Mr. Boyle describes the homestead of a Boer substantially as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\nReaching the home of a farmer named Vasson, he found himself in the midst\r\nof a scene quite patriarchal. All the plain before the house was white\r\nwith sheep and lambs, drinking at the “dam” or in long troughs. The dam is\r\nan indispensable institution in a country where springs are scarce, and\r\nwhere a river is a prodigy. It is the new settler’s first work, even\r\nbefore erecting his house, to find a hollow space, and dam it up, so as to\r\nmake a reservoir. He then proceeds to make the best sun-dried bricks he\r\ncan, and to erect his cottage, usually of two, and rarely more than three,\r\nrooms. Not unfrequently, there is a garden, hardly worthy of the name,\r\nwhere a few potatoes and onions are raised. The farmers, more especially\r\nthe Dutch, are “the heaviest and largest in the world.” At an early age\r\ntheir drowsy habits and copious feeding run them into flesh. “Three times\r\na day the family gorges itself upon lumps of mutton, fried in the tallowy\r\nfat of the sheep’s tail, or else—their only change of diet—upon the\r\ntasteless _fricadel_—kneaded balls of meat and onions, likewise swimming\r\nin grease. Very few vegetables they have, and those are rarely used. Brown\r\nbread they make, but scarcely touch it. Fancy existing from birth to death\r\nupon mutton scraps, half boiled, half fried, in tallow! So doth the Boer.\r\nIt is not eating, but devouring, with him. And fancy the existence! always\r\nalone with one’s father, mother, brothers, and sisters; of whom not one\r\ncan do more than write his name, scarce one can read, not one has heard of\r\nany event in history, nor dreamed of such existing things as art or\r\nscience, or poetry, or aught that pertains to civilisation.” An unpleasant\r\npicture, truly, and one to which there are many exceptions. It was\r\ndoubtful whether Mr. Vasson could read. His farm was several thousand\r\nacres. The ancient law of Cape Colony gave the settler 3,000\r\n_morgen_—something more than 6,000 acres. He was not obliged to take so\r\nmuch, but, whatever the size of his farm might be, it must be _circular_\r\nin shape; and as the circumference of a property could only touch the\r\nadjoining grants it follows that there were immense corners or tracts of\r\nland left waste between. Clever and ambitious farmers, in these later\r\ndays, have been silently absorbing said corners into their estates,\r\ngreatly increasing their size.\r\n\r\nThe Cape cannot be recommended to the notice of poor emigrants, but to\r\ncapitalists it offers splendid inducements. Mr. Irons, in his work on the\r\nCape and Natal settlements,(119) cites several actual cases, showing the\r\nprofits on capital invested in sheep-farming. In one case £1,250 realised,\r\nin about three years, £2,860, which includes the sale of the wool. A\r\nsecond statement gives the profits on an outlay of £2,225, after seven\r\nyears. It amounts to over £8,000. Rents in the towns are low; beef and\r\nmutton do not exceed fourpence per pound, while bread, made largely from\r\nimported flour, is a shilling and upwards per four-pound loaf.\r\n\r\nSo many sailors have made for the Diamond-fields, since their discovery,\r\nfrom the Cape, Port Elizabeth, or Natal, and so many more will do the\r\nsame, as any new deposit is found, that it will not be out of place here\r\nto give the facts concerning them. In 1871, when Mr. Boyle visited them,\r\nthe ride up cost from £12 to £16, with additional expenses for meals, &c.\r\nOf course, a majority of the 50,000 men who have been congregated at times\r\nat the various fields could not and did not afford this; but it is a tramp\r\nof 750 miles from Cape Town, or 450 from Port Elizabeth or Natal. From the\r\nCape, a railway, for about sixty miles, eases some of the distance. On the\r\njourney up, which reads very like Western experiences in America, two of\r\nthree mules were twenty-six hours and a half in harness, and covered 110\r\nmiles! South Africa requires a society for the prevention of cruelty to\r\nanimals, one would think. Mr. Boyle also saw another way by which the\r\ncolonist may become rapidly wealthy—in ostrich-farming. Broods, purchased\r\nfor £5 to £9, in three years gain their full plumages, and yield in\r\nfeathers £4 to £6 per annum. They become quite tame, are not delicate to\r\nrear, and are easily managed. And they also met the down coaches from the\r\nfields, on one of which a young fellow—almost a boy—had no less than 235\r\ncarats with him. At last they reached Pniel (“a camp”), a place which once\r\nheld 5,000 workers and delvers, and in November, 1872, was reduced to a\r\nfew hundred, like the deserted diggings in California and Australia. It\r\nhad, however, yielded largely for a time.\r\n\r\nThe words, “Here be diamonds,” are to be found inscribed on an old\r\nmission-map of a part of the Colony, of the date of 1750, or thereabouts.\r\nIn 1867, a trader up country, near Hope Town, saw the children of a Boer\r\nplaying with some pebbles, picked up along the banks of the Orange River.\r\nAn ostrich-hunter named O’Reilly was present, and the pair of them were\r\nstruck with the appearance of one of the stones, and they tried it on\r\nglass, scratching the sash all over. A bargain was soon struck: O’Reilly\r\nwas to take it to Cape Town; and there Sir P. E. Wodehouse soon gave him\r\n£500 for it. Then came an excitement, of course. In 1869, a Hottentot\r\nshepherd, named Swartzboy, brought to a country store a gem of 83½ carats.\r\nThe shopman, in his master’s absence, did not like to risk the £200 worth\r\nof goods demanded. Swartzboy passed on to the farm of one Niekirk, where\r\nhe asked, and eventually got, £400. Niekirk sold it for £12,000 the same\r\nday! Now, of course, the excitement became a fevered frenzy.\r\n\r\nSupreme among the camps around Pniel reigned Mr. President Parker, a\r\nsailor who, leaving the sea, had turned trader. Mr. Parker, with his\r\ncounsellors, were absolute in power, and, all in all, administered justice\r\nvery fairly. Ducking in the river was the mildest punishment; the naval\r\n“cat” came next; while dragging through the river was the third grade;\r\nlast of all came the “spread eagle,” in which the culprit was extended\r\nflat, hands and feet staked down, and so exposed to the angry sun.\r\n\r\nIn a short time, the yield from the various fields was not under £300,000\r\nper month, and claims were sold at hundreds and thousands of pounds\r\napiece. Then came a time of depression, when the dealers would not buy, or\r\nonly at terribly low prices. Meantime, although meat was always cheap,\r\neverything else was very high. A cabbage, for example, often fetched 10s.,\r\na water-melon 15s., and onions and green figs a shilling apiece. Forage\r\nfor horses was half-a-crown a bundle of four pounds. To-day they are\r\nlittle higher on the Fields than in other parts of the Colony.\r\n\r\nThat a number of diggers have made snug little piles, ranging from two or\r\nthree to eight, ten, or more thousand pounds, is undeniable, but they were\r\nvery exceptional cases, after all. The dealers in diamonds, though, often\r\nturned over immense sums very rapidly.\r\n\r\nAnd now, before taking our leave of the African station, let us pay a\r\nflying visit to Natal, which colony has been steadily rising of late\r\nyears, and which offers many advantages to the visitor and settler. The\r\nclimate, in spite of the hot sirocco which sometimes blows over it, and\r\nthe severe thunderstorms, is, all in all, superior to most of the African\r\nclimates, inasmuch as the rainfall is as nearly as possible that of\r\nLondon, and it falls at the period when most wanted—at the time of\r\ngreatest warmth and most active vegetation. The productions of Natal are\r\neven more varied than those of the Cape, while arrowroot, sugar, cotton,\r\nand Indian corn are staple articles. _The_ great industries are cattle and\r\nsheep-rearing, and, as in all parts of South Africa, meat is excessively\r\ncheap, retailing at threepence or fourpence a pound.\r\n\r\nNatal was discovered by Vasco da Gama, and received from him the name of\r\nTerra Natalis—“Land of the Nativity”—because of his arriving on Christmas\r\nDay. Until 1823 it was little known or visited. A settlement was then\r\nformed by a party of Englishmen, who were joined by a number of\r\ndissatisfied Dutchmen from the Cape. In 1838 the British Government took\r\npossession. There was a squabble, the colonists being somewhat defiant for\r\na while, and some little fighting ensued. It was proposed by the settlers\r\nto proclaim the Republic of Natalia, but on the appearance of a strong\r\nBritish force, they subsided quietly, and Natal was placed under the\r\ncontrol of the Governor of the Cape. In 1856, it was erected into a\r\nseparate colony.\r\n\r\nTo moderate capitalists it offers many advantages. Land is granted on the\r\neasiest terms, usually four shillings per acre; and free grants are given,\r\nin proportion to a settler’s capital: £500 capital receives a land order\r\nfor 200 acres. An arrowroot plantation and factory can be started for £500\r\nor £600, and a coffee plantation for something over £1,000.\r\nSugar-planting, &c., is much more expensive, and would require for plant,\r\n&c., £5,000, or more.\r\n\r\nAnd now, on the way home from the African station, the good ship will pass\r\nclose to, if indeed it does not touch at, the Island of St. Helena, a\r\ncommon place of refreshment for vessels sailing to the northward. Vessels\r\ncoming southward rarely do so; sailing ships can hardly make the island.\r\nIt lies some 1,200 miles from the African coasts, in mid-ocean. St. Helena\r\nhas much the appearance, seen from a distance, of the summit of some great\r\nsubmarine mountain, its rugged and perpendicular cliffs rising from the\r\nshore to altitudes from 300 to 1,500 feet. In a few scattered places there\r\nare deep, precipitous ravines, opening to the sea, whose embouchures form\r\ndifficult but still possible landing-places for the fishermen. In one of\r\nthe largest of these, towards the north-west, the capital and port of the\r\nisland, James Town, is situated. It is the residence of the authorities.\r\nThe anchorage is good and sufficiently deep, and the port is well\r\nprotected from the winds. The town is entered by an arched gateway, within\r\nwhich is a spacious parade, lined with official residences, and faced by a\r\nhandsome church. The town is in no way remarkable, but has well-supplied\r\nshops. The leading inhabitants prefer to live outside it on the higher and\r\ncooler plateaux of the island, where many of them have very fine country\r\nhouses, foremost of which is a villa named Plantation House, belonging to\r\nthe governor, surrounded by pleasant grounds, handsome trees and shrubs.\r\nIn the garden grounds tropical and ordinary fruits and vegetables\r\nflourish; the mango, banana, tamarind, and sugar-cane; the orange, citron,\r\ngrape, fig, and olive, equally with the common fruits of England. The yam\r\nand all the European vegetables abound; three crops of potatoes have been\r\noften raised from the same ground in one year. The hills are covered with\r\nthe cabbage tree, and the log-wood and gum-wood trees. Cattle and sheep\r\nare scarce, but goats browse in immense herds on the hills. No beasts of\r\nprey are to be met, but there are plenty of unpleasant and poisonous\r\ninsects. Game and fish are abundant, and turtles are often found. All in\r\nall, it is not a bad place for Jack after a long voyage, although not\r\nconsidered healthy. It has a military governor, and there are barracks.\r\n\r\nThe interior is a plateau, divided by low mountains, the former averaging\r\n1,500 feet above the sea. The island is undoubtedly of volcanic origin. It\r\nwas discovered on the 22nd May (St. Helena’s Day), by Juan de Nova, a\r\nPortuguese. The Dutch first held it, and it was wrested from them first by\r\nEngland in 1673, Charles II. soon afterwards granting it to the East India\r\nCompany, who, with the exception of the period of Napoleon’s imprisonment,\r\nheld the proprietorship to 1834, when it became an appanage of the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe fame of the little island rests on its having been the prison of the\r\ngreat disturber of Europe. Every reader knows the circumstances which\r\npreceded that event. He had gone to Rochefort with the object of embarking\r\nfor America, but finding the whole coast so blockaded as to render that\r\nscheme impracticable, surrendered himself to Captain Maitland, commander\r\nof the English man-of-war _Bellerophon_, who immediately set sail for\r\nTorbay. No notice whatever was taken of his letter—an uncourteous\r\nproceeding, to say the least of it, towards a fallen foe—and on the 7th of\r\nAugust he was removed to the _Northumberland_, the flag-ship of Sir George\r\nCockburn, which immediately set sail for St. Helena.\r\n\r\nOn arrival the imperial captive was at first lodged in a sort of inn. The\r\nfollowing day the ex-emperor and suite rode out to visit Longwood, the\r\nseat selected for his residence, and when returning noted a small villa\r\nwith a pavilion attached to it, about two miles from the town, the\r\nresidence of Mr. Balcombe, an inhabitant of the island. The spot attracted\r\nthe emperor’s notice, and the admiral, who had accompanied him, thought it\r\nwould be better for him to remain there than to go back to the town, where\r\nthe sentinels at the doors and the gaping crowds in a manner confined him\r\nto his chamber. The place pleased the emperor, for the position was quiet,\r\nand commanded a fine view. The pavilion was a kind of summer-house on a\r\npointed eminence, about fifty paces from the house, where the family were\r\naccustomed to resort in fine weather, and this was the retreat hired for\r\nthe temporary abode of the emperor. It contained only one room on the\r\nground-floor, without curtains or shutters, and scarcely possessed a seat;\r\nand when Napoleon retired to rest, one of the windows had to be\r\nbarricaded, so draughty was it, in order to exclude the night air, to\r\nwhich he had become particularly sensitive. What a contrast to the gay\r\npalaces of France!\r\n\r\n                       [Illustration: ST. HELENA.]\r\n\r\nIn December the emperor removed to Longwood, riding thither on a small\r\nCape horse, and in his uniform of a chasseur of the guards. The road was\r\nlined with spectators, and he was received at the entrance to Longwood by\r\na guard under arms, who rendered the prescribed honour to their\r\nillustrious captive. The place, which had been a farm of the East India\r\nCompany, is situated on one of the highest parts of the island, and the\r\ndifference between its temperature and that of the valley below is very\r\ngreat. It is surrounded by a level height of some extent, and is near the\r\neastern coast. It is stated that continual and frequently violent winds\r\nblow regularly from the same quarter. The sun was rarely seen, and there\r\nwere heavy rainfalls. The water, conveyed to Longwood in pipes, was found\r\nto be so unwholesome as to require boiling before it was fit for use. The\r\nsurroundings were barren rocks, gloomy deep valleys, and desolate gullies,\r\nthe only redeeming feature being a glimpse of the ocean on one hand. All\r\nthis after La Belle France!\r\n\r\nLongwood as a residence had not much to boast of. The building was\r\nrambling and inconveniently arranged; it had been built up by degrees, as\r\nthe wants of its former inmates had increased. One or two of the suite\r\nslept in lofts, reached by ladders and trap-doors. The windows and beds\r\nwere curtainless, and the furniture mean and scanty. Inhospitable and in\r\nbad taste, ye in power at the time! In front of the place, and separated\r\nby a tolerably deep ravine, the 53rd Regiment was encamped in detached\r\nbodies on the neighbouring heights. Here the caged lion spent the last\r\nfive weary years of his life till called away by the God of Battles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE SERVICE.—OFFICERS’ LIFE ON BOARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Conditions of Life on Ship-board—A Model Ward-room—An Admiral’s\r\n    Cabin—Captains and Captains—The Sailor and his Superior Officers—A\r\n         Contrast—A Commander of the Old School—Jack Larmour—Lord\r\n     Cochrane’s Experiences—His Chest Curtailed—The Stinking Ship—The\r\n      First Command—Shaving under Difficulties—The _Speedy_ and her\r\n             Prizes—The Doctor—On Board a Gun-boat—Cabin and\r\n      Dispensary—Cockroaches and Centipedes—Other horrors—The Naval\r\n        Chaplain—His Duties—Stories of an Amateur—The Engineer—His\r\n    Increasing Importance—Popularity of the Navy—Nelson always a Model\r\n    Commander—The Idol of his Colleagues, Officers, and Men—Taking the\r\n       Men into his Confidence—The Action between the _Bellona_ and\r\n       _Courageux_—Captain Falknor’s Speech to the Crew—An Obsolete\r\n     Custom—Crossing the Line—Neptune’s Visit to the Quarter-deck—The\r\n     Navy of To-day—Its Backbone—Progressive Increase in the Size of\r\n     Vessels—Naval Volunteers—A Noble Movement—Excellent Results—The\r\n                              Naval Reserve.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the previous pages we have given some account of the various stations\r\nvisited by the Royal Navy of Great Britain. Let us next take a glance at\r\nthe ships themselves—the quarter-deck, the captain’s cabin, and the\r\nward-room. In a word, let us see how the officers of a ship live, move,\r\nand have their being on board.\r\n\r\nTheir condition depends very much on their ship, their captain, and\r\nthemselves. The first point may be dismissed briefly, as the general\r\nimprovement in all descriptions of vessels, including their interior\r\narrangements, is too marked to need mentioning. The ward-room of a modern\r\nman-of-war is often as well furnished as any other dining-room—handsomely\r\ncarpeted, the sides adorned with pictures, with comfortable chairs and\r\nlounges, and excellent appointments at table. In the ward-room of a\r\nRussian corvette visited by the writer, he found a saloon large enough for\r\na ball, with piano, and gorgeous side-board, set out as in the houses of\r\nmost of the northern nations of Europe, with sundry bottles and incitives\r\nto emptying them, in the shape of salt anchovies and salmon, caviare and\r\ncheese. In a British flag-ship he found the admiral’s cabin, while in port\r\nat least, a perfect little bijou of a drawing-room, with harmonium and\r\npiano, vases of flowers, portfolios of drawings, an elaborate stove, and\r\nall else that could conduce to comfort and luxury. Outside of this was a\r\nmore plainly-furnished cabin, used as a dining-room. Of course much of\r\nthis disappears at sea. The china and glass are securely packed, and all\r\nof the smaller loose articles stowed away; the piano covered up in canvas\r\nand securely “tied up” to the side; likely enough the carpet removed, and\r\na rough canvas substituted. Still, all is ship-shape and neat as a new\r\npin. The few “old tubs” of vessels still in the service are rarely\r\nemployed beyond trifling harbour duties, or are kept for emergencies on\r\nforeign stations. They will soon disappear, to be replaced by smart and\r\nhandy little gun-boats or other craft, where, if the accommodations are\r\nlimited, at least the very most is made of the room at command. How\r\ndifferent all this is to many of the vessels of the last century and\r\ncommencement of this, described by our nautical novelists as little better\r\nthan colliers, pest ships, and tubs, smelling of pitch, paint,\r\nbilge-water, tar, and rum! Readers will remember Marryat’s captain, who,\r\nwith his wife, was so inordinately fond of pork that he turned his ship\r\ninto a floating pig-sty. At his dinner there appeared mock-turtle soup (of\r\npig’s head); boiled pork and pease pudding; roast spare rib; sausages and\r\npettitoes; and, last of all, sucking-pig. He will doubtless remember how\r\nhe was eventually frightened off the ship, then about to proceed to the\r\nWest Indies, by the doctor telling him that with his habit of living he\r\nwould not give much for his life on that station. But although Marryat’s\r\ncharacters were true to the life of his time, you would go far to find a\r\nsimilar example to-day. Captains still have their idiosyncrasies, but not\r\nof such a marked nature. There may be indolent captains, like he who was\r\nnicknamed “The Sloth;” or, less likely, prying captains, like he in “Peter\r\nSimple,” who made himself so unpopular that he lost all the good sailors\r\non board, and had to put up with a “scratch crew;” or (a comparatively\r\nharmless variety) captains who amuse their officers with the most\r\noutrageous yarns, but who are in all else the souls of honour. Who can\r\nhelp laughing over that Captain Kearney, who tells the tale of the Atta of\r\nRoses ship? He relates how she had a puncheon of the precious essence on\r\nboard; it could be smelt three miles off at sea, and the odour was so\r\nstrong on board that the men fainted when they ventured near the hold. The\r\ntimbers of the ship became so impregnated with the smell that they could\r\nnever make any use of her afterwards, till they broke her up and sold her\r\nto the shopkeepers of Brighton and Tunbridge-wells, who turned her into\r\nscented boxes and fancy articles, and then into money. The absolutely\r\nvulgar captain is a thing of the past, for the possibilities of entering\r\n“by the hawse-hole,” the technical expression applied to the man who was\r\noccasionally in the old times promoted from the fo’castle to the\r\nquarter-deck, are very rare indeed nowadays. Still, there are\r\ngentlemen—and there are gentlemen. The perfect example is a _rara avis_\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: ON DECK OF A MAN-OF-WAR, EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.]\r\n\r\nThe true reason why a captain may make his officers and men constitute an\r\nagreeable happy family, or a perfect pandemonium of discontent and misery,\r\nconsists in the abuse of his absolute power. That power is necessarily\r\nbestowed on him; there must be a head; without good discipline, no vessel\r\ncan be properly handled, or the emergencies of seamanship and warfare met.\r\nBut as he can in minor matters have it all his own way, and even in many\r\nmore important ones can determine absolutely, without the fear of anything\r\nor anybody short of a court-martial, he may, and often does, become a\r\nmartinet, if not a very tyrant.\r\n\r\nThe subordinate officer’s life may be rendered a burden by a cantankerous\r\nand exacting captain. Every trifling omission may be magnified into a\r\ngrave offence. Some captains seem to go on the principle of the Irishman\r\nwho asked, “Who’ll tread on my coat tails?” or of the other, “Did you blow\r\nyour nose at me, sir?” And again, that which in the captain is no offence\r\nis a very serious one on the part of the officer or seaman. He may exhaust\r\nthe vocabulary of abuse and bad language, but not a retort may be made. In\r\nthe Royal Navy of to-day, though by no means in the merchant service, this\r\nis, however, nearly obsolete. However tyrannically disposed, the language\r\nof commanders and officers is nearly sure to be free from disgraceful\r\nepithets, blasphemies, and scurrilous abuse, cursing and swearing.\r\nOfficers should be, and generally are, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nA commanding lieutenant of the old school—a type of officer not to be\r\nfound in the Royal Navy nowadays—is well described by Admiral\r\nCochrane.(120) “My kind uncle,” writes he, “the Hon. John Cochrane,\r\naccompanied me on board the _Iliad_ for the purpose of introducing me to\r\nmy future superior officer, Lieutenant Larmour, or, as he was more\r\nfamiliarly known in the service, Jack Larmour—a specimen of the old\r\nBritish seaman, little calculated to inspire exalted ideas of the\r\ngentility of the naval profession, though presenting at a glance a\r\npersonification of its efficiency. Jack was, in fact, one of a not very\r\nnumerous class, whom, for their superior seamanship, the Admiralty was\r\nglad to promote from the forecastle to the quarter-deck, in order that\r\nthey might mould into ship-shape the questionable materials supplied by\r\nparliamentary influence, even then paramount in the navy to a degree which\r\nmight otherwise have led to disaster. Lucky was the commander who could\r\nsecure such an officer for his quarter-deck.\r\n\r\n“On my introduction, Jack was dressed in the garb of a seaman, with\r\nmarlinspike slung round his neck, and a lump of grease in his hand, and\r\nwas busily employed in setting up the rigging. His reception of me was\r\nanything but gracious. Indeed, a tall fellow, over six feet high, the\r\nnephew of his captain, and a lord to boot, were not very promising\r\nrecommendations for a midshipman. It is not impossible he might have\r\nlearned from my uncle something about a military commission of several\r\nyears’ standing; and this, coupled with my age and stature, might easily\r\nhave impressed him with the idea that he had caught a scapegrace with whom\r\nthe family did not know what to do, and that he was hence to be saddled\r\nwith a ‘hard bargain.’\r\n\r\n“After a little constrained civility on the part of the first lieutenant,\r\nwho was evidently not very well pleased with the interruption to his\r\navocation, he ordered me to ‘get my traps below.’ Scarcely was the order\r\ncomplied with, and myself introduced to the midshipman’s berth, than I\r\noverheard Jack grumbling at the magnitude of my equipments. ‘This Lord\r\nCochrane’s chest? Does Lord Cochrane think he is going to bring a cabin\r\naboard? Get it up on the main-deck!’\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BETWEEN DECKS OF A MAN-OF-WAR, EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.]\r\n\r\n“This order being promptly obeyed, amidst a running fire of similar\r\nobjurgations, the key of the chest was sent for, and shortly afterwards\r\nthe sound of sawing became audible. It was now high time to follow my\r\nproperty, which, to my astonishment, had been turned out on the deck—Jack\r\nsuperintending the sawing off one end of the chest just beyond the\r\nkeyhole, and accompanying the operation by sundry uncomplimentary\r\nobservations on midshipmen in general, and on myself in particular.\r\n\r\n“The metamorphosis being completed to the lieutenant’s satisfaction—though\r\nnot at all to mine, for my neat chest had become an unshapely piece of\r\nlumber—he pointed out the ‘lubberliness of shore-going people in not\r\nmaking keyholes where they could most easily be got at,’ viz., at the end\r\nof a chest instead of the middle!” Lord Cochrane took it easily, and\r\nacknowledges warmly the service Jack Larmour rendered him in teaching him\r\nhis profession.\r\n\r\nLater, Lord Cochrane, when promoted to a lieutenancy, was dining with\r\nAdmiral Vandepat, and being seated near him, was asked what dish was\r\nbefore him. “Mentioning its nature,” says he, “I asked whether he would\r\npermit me to help him. The uncourteous reply was—that whenever he wished\r\nfor anything he was in the habit of asking for it. Not knowing what to\r\nmake of a rebuff of this nature, it was met with an inquiry if he would\r\nallow me the honour of taking wine with him. ‘I never take wine with any\r\nman, my lord,’ was the unexpected reply, from which it struck me that my\r\nlot was cast among Goths, if no worse.” Subsequently he found that this\r\napparently gruff old admiral assumed some of this roughness purposely, and\r\nthat he was one of the kindest commanders living.\r\n\r\nIn 1798, when with the Mediterranean fleet, ludicrous examples, both of\r\nthe not very occasional corruption of the period, and the rigid etiquette\r\nrequired by one’s superior officer, occurred to Lord Cochrane, and got him\r\ninto trouble. The first officer, Lieutenant Beaver, was one who carried\r\nthe latter almost to the verge of despotism. He looked after all that was\r\nvisible to the eye of the admiral, but permitted “an honest penny to be\r\nturned elsewhere.” At Tetuan they had purchased and killed bullocks _on\r\nboard the flagship_, for the use of the whole squadron. The reason for\r\nthis was that the hides, being valuable, could be stowed away in her hold\r\nor empty beef-casks, as especial perquisites to certain persons on board.\r\nThe fleshy fragments on the hides soon decomposed, and rendered the hold\r\nof the vessel so intolerable that she acquired the name of the “Stinking\r\nScotch ship.” Lord Cochrane, as junior lieutenant, had much to do with\r\nthese arrangements, and his unfavourable remarks on these raw-hide\r\nspeculations did not render those interested very friendly towards him.\r\nOne day, when at Tetuan, he was allowed to go wild-fowl shooting ashore,\r\nand became covered with mud. On arriving rather late at the ship, he\r\nthought it more respectful to don a clean uniform before reporting himself\r\non the quarter-deck. He had scarcely made the change, when the first\r\nlieutenant came into the ward-room, and harshly demanded of Lord Cochrane\r\nthe reason for not having reported himself. His reply was, that as the\r\nlieutenant had seen him come up by the side he must be aware that he was\r\nnot in a fit condition to appear on the quarter-deck. The lieutenant\r\nreplied so offensively before the ward-room officers, that he was\r\nrespectfully reminded by Cochrane of a rule he had himself laid down, that\r\n“Matters connected with the service were not there to be spoken of.”\r\nAnother retort was followed by the sensible enough reply, “Lieutenant\r\nBeaver, we will, if you please, talk of this in another place.” Cochrane\r\nwas immediately reported to the captain by Beaver, as having challenged\r\nhim: the lieutenant actually demanded a court-martial! And the\r\ncourt-martial was held, the decision being that Cochrane should be\r\nadmonished to be “more careful in future.”\r\n\r\nLord Cochrane was soon after given a command. The vessel to which he was\r\nappointed was, even eighty years ago, a mere burlesque of a ship-of-war.\r\nShe was about the size of an average coasting brig, her burden being 158\r\ntons. She was crowded rather than manned, with a crew of eighty-four men\r\nand six officers. Her armament consisted of fourteen _4-pounders_! a\r\nspecies of gun little larger than a blunderbuss, and formerly known in the\r\nservice as “minion,” an appellation quite appropriate. The cabin had not\r\nso much as room for a chair, the floor being entirely occupied by a small\r\ntable surrounded with lockers, answering the double purpose of\r\nstore-chests and seats. The difficulty was to get seated, the ceiling\r\nbeing only five feet high, so that the object could only be accomplished\r\nby rolling on the lockers: a movement sometimes attended with unpleasant\r\nfailure. Cochrane’s only practicable way of shaving consisted in removing\r\nthe skylight, and putting his head through to make a toilet-table of the\r\nquarter-deck!\r\n\r\nOn this little vessel—the _Speedy_—Cochrane took a number of prizes, and\r\nhaving on one occasion manned a couple of them with half his crew and sent\r\nthem away, was forced to tackle the _Gamo_, a Spanish frigate of\r\nthirty-two heavy guns and 319 men. The exploit has hardly been excelled in\r\nthe history of heroic deeds. The commander’s orders were not to fire a\r\nsingle gun till they were close to the frigate, and he ran the _Speedy_\r\nunder her lee, so that her yards were locked among the latter’s rigging.\r\nThe shots from the Spanish guns passed over the little vessel, only\r\ninjuring the rigging, while the _Speedy’s_ mere pop-guns could be\r\nelevated, and helped to blow up the main-deck of the enemy’s ship. The\r\nSpaniards speedily found out the disadvantage under which they were\r\nfighting, and gave the orders to board the little English vessel; but it\r\nwas avoided twice by sheering off sufficiently, then giving them a volley\r\nof musketry and a broadside before they could recover themselves. After\r\nthe lapse of an hour, the loss to the _Speedy_ was only four men killed\r\nand two wounded, but her rigging was so cut up and the sails so riddled\r\nthat Cochrane told his men they must either take the frigate or be taken\r\nthemselves, in which case the Spaniards would give no quarter. The doctor,\r\nMr. Guthrie, bravely volunteered to take the helm, and leaving him for the\r\ntime both commander and crew of the ship, Cochrane and his men were soon\r\non the enemy’s deck, the _Speedy_ being put close alongside with admirable\r\nskill. A portion of the crew had been ordered to blacken their faces and\r\nboard by the _Gamo’s_ head. The greater portion of the Spanish crew were\r\nprepared to repel boarders in that direction, but stood for a few moments\r\nas it were transfixed to the deck by the apparition of so many\r\ndiabolical-looking figures emerging from the white smoke of the bow guns,\r\nwhile the other men rushed on them from behind before they could recover\r\nfrom their surprise at the unexpected phenomenon. Observing the Spanish\r\ncolours still flying, Lord Cochrane ordered one of his men to haul them\r\ndown, and the crew, without pausing to consider by whose orders they had\r\nbeen struck, and naturally believing it to be the act of their own\r\nofficers, gave in. The total English loss was three men killed, and one\r\nofficer and seventeen men wounded. The _Gamo’s_ loss was the captain,\r\nboatswain, and thirteen seamen killed, with forty-one wounded. It became a\r\npuzzle what to do with 263 unhurt prisoners, the _Speedy_ having only\r\nforty-two sound men left. Promptness was necessary; so, driving the\r\nprisoners into the hold, with their own guns pointed down the hatchway,\r\nand leaving thirty men on the prize, Cochrane shaped the vessel’s course\r\nto Port Mahon, which was reached safely. Some Barcelona gun-boats,\r\nspectators of the action, did not venture to rescue the frigate.\r\n\r\nThe doctor on board a man-of-war has, perhaps, on the whole, better\r\nopportunities and, in times of peace, more leisure than the other officers\r\nfor noting any circumstances of interest that may occur. Dr. Stables, in\r\nhis interesting little work,(121) describes his cabin on board a small\r\ngun-boat as a miserable little box, such as at home he would have kept\r\nrabbits or guinea-pigs in, but certainly not pigeons. He says that it\r\nmight do for a commodore—Commodore Nutt. It was ventilated by a small\r\nscuttle, seven inches in diameter, which could only be raised in harbour,\r\nand beneath which, when he first went to sea, he was obliged to put a\r\nleather hat-box to catch the water; unfortunately, the bottom rotted out,\r\nand he was at the mercy of the waves. This cabin was alive with scorpions,\r\ncockroaches, and other “crawling ferlies,”\r\n\r\n  “That e’en to name would be unlawfu’.”\r\n\r\nHis dispensary was off the steerage, and sister-cabin to the pantry. To it\r\nhe gained access by a species of crab-walking, squeezing himself past a\r\nlarge brass pump, edging in sideways. The sick would come one by one to\r\nthe dispensary, and there he saw and treated each case as it arrived,\r\ndressing wounds, bruises, and putrefying sores. There was no sick berth\r\nattendant, but the lieutenant told off “a little cabin-boy” for his use.\r\nHe was not a model cabin-boy, like the youngster you see in the theatres.\r\nHe certainly managed at times to wash out the dispensary, in the intervals\r\nof catching cockroaches and making poultices, but in doing the first he\r\nbroke half the bottles, and making the latter either let them burn or put\r\nsalt into them. Finally, he smashed so much of the doctor’s apparatus that\r\nhe was kicked out. In both dispensary and what Dr. Stables calls his\r\n“burrow,” it was difficult to prevent anything from going to utter\r\ndestruction. The best portions of his uniform got eaten by cockroaches or\r\nmoulded by damp, while his instruments required cleaning every morning,\r\nand even this did not keep the rust at bay.\r\n\r\nAnd then, those terrible cockroaches! To find, when you awake, a couple,\r\neach two inches in length, meandering over your face, or even in bed with\r\nyou!—to find one in a state of decay in the mustard-pot!—to have to remove\r\ntheir droppings and eggs from the edge of your plate previous to eating\r\nyour soup! and so on, _ad nauseam_. But on small vessels stationed in the\r\ntropics—as described by the doctor—there were, and doubtless sometimes are\r\nnow, other unpleasantnesses. For instance, you are looking for a book, and\r\nput your hand on a full-grown scaly scorpion. Nice sensation! the animal\r\ntwining round your finger, or running up your sleeve! _Dénoûment_:\r\ncracking him under foot—joy at escaping a sting!\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: NAVAL OFFICERS AND SEAMEN, EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.]\r\n\r\n“You are enjoying your dinner, but have been for some time sensible of a\r\nstrange, titillating feeling about the region of your ankle; you look down\r\nat last, to find a centipede on your sock, with his fifty hind legs—you\r\nthank God not his fore-fifty!—abutting on your shin. _Tableaux_:\r\ngreen-to-red light from the eyes of the many-legged—horror of yourself as\r\nyou wait till he thinks proper to ‘move on.’\r\n\r\n“To awake in the morning, and find a large, healthy-looking tarantula\r\nsquatting on your pillow, within ten inches of your nose, with his\r\nbasilisk eyes fixed on yours, and apparently saying: ‘You’re awake, are\r\nyou? I’ve been sitting here all the morning, watching you.’\r\n\r\n“You think, if you move, he’ll bite you somewhere—and if he _does_ bite\r\nyou, you’ll go mad, and dance _ad libitum_—so you twist your mouth in the\r\nopposite direction, and ejaculate—‘Steward!’ But the steward does not\r\ncome; in fact, he is forward, seeing after breakfast. Meanwhile, the\r\ngentleman on the pillow is moving his horizontal mandibles in a most\r\nthreatening manner; and just as he moves for your nose, you tumble out of\r\nyour bed with a shriek, and, if a very nervous person, probably run on\r\ndeck in your shirt!”\r\n\r\nThe doctor’s last description of an accumulation of these horrors is\r\nfearful to even think about. The bulkheads all around your berth are black\r\nwith cock and hen-roaches, a few of which are nipping your toe, and\r\nrunning off with little bits of the skin of your leg; while a troop of\r\nants are carrying a dead one over your pillow; musquitoes and flies\r\nattacking you everywhere; rats running in and rats running out; your lamp\r\njust flickering and dying away into darkness, with the delicious certainty\r\nthat an indefinite number of earwigs and scorpions, besides two centipedes\r\nand a tarantula, are hiding themselves somewhere in your cabin! All this\r\nis possible; still Dr. Stables describes life on other vessels under more\r\nfavourable auspices.\r\n\r\nThe important addition of a chaplain to the establishment on board our\r\nships of war seems, from the following letter of George, Duke of\r\nBuckingham, to have been first adopted in the year 1626:—\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         “THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n“After my hearty commendations. His Majesty having given order for\r\npreachers to goe in every of his ships to sea, choyce hath been made of\r\none Mr. Daniel Ambrose, Master of Arts and Fellow of your College, to be\r\none. Accordingly, upon signification to me to come hither, I thought good\r\nto intimate unto you, that His Majesty is so careful of such scholars as\r\nare willing to put themselves forward in so good actions, as that he will\r\nexpect—and I doubt not but that you will accordingly take order—that the\r\nsaid Mr. Ambrose shall suffer noe detriment in his place with you, by this\r\nhis employment; but that you will rather take care that he shall have all\r\nimmunities and emoluments with advantage, which have been formerly, or may\r\nbe, granted to any upon the like service. Wherein, not doubting of your\r\naffectionate care, I rest,\r\n\r\n                                                “Your very loving friend,\r\n                                                           “G. BUCKINGHAM.\r\n_“York House, July 29th, 1626.”_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSailors, in spite of their outbursts of recklessness, have frequently,\r\nfrom the very nature of their perilous calling, an amount of seriousness\r\nunderlying their character, which makes them particularly amenable to\r\nreligious influences. The chaplain on a large modern ironclad or frigate\r\nhas as many men in his charge, as regards spiritual matters, as the vicar\r\nof a country town or large village, whilst he has many more opportunities\r\nof reaching them directly. Many of our naval chaplains are noble fellows;\r\nand to them come the sailors in any distress of mind, for the soothing\r\nadvice so readily given. He may not dare to interfere with the powers that\r\nbe when they are in danger of punishment, except in very rare cases; but\r\nhe can point them out their path of duty, and how to walk in it, making\r\nthem better sailors and happier men. He can lend them an occasional book,\r\nor write for them an occasional letter home; induce them to refrain from\r\ndissipation when on liberty; cheer them in the hour of greatest peril,\r\nwhile on the watery deep, and give them an occasional reproof, but in\r\nkindness, not in anger. To his brother officers he has even better\r\nopportunities of doing good than to the men. On the smaller classes of\r\nvessels—gun-boats and the like—the captain has to perform chaplain’s\r\nduties, by reading prayers on the Sabbath. This is the case also on\r\nwell-regulated steamships or passenger sailing-vessels of the merchant\r\nservice. The fine steamers of such lines as the Cunard, or White Star, of\r\nthe Royal Mail Company, or of the P. and O., have, of course, frequently,\r\nsome clergyman, minister, or missionary on board, who is willing to\r\ncelebrate divine service.\r\n\r\nA Committee of the Lower House of Convocation has recently collected an\r\nimmense amount of statistics regarding the provision made by private\r\nship-owners for the spiritual welfare of their men, and the result as\r\nregards England is not at all satisfactory. In point of fact, it is rarely\r\nmade at all. The committee seeks to encourage the growth of religion among\r\nsailors by providing suitable and comfortable church accommodation at all\r\nports, and urges owners to instruct their captains as to conducting divine\r\nservice on Sundays, and to furnish Bibles, prayer-books, and instructive\r\nworks of secular literature. Too much must not, however, be expected from\r\nJack. The hardships and perils through which he passes excuse much of his\r\nexuberance ashore. It is his holiday-time; and, so long as he is only gay,\r\nand not abandoned, the most rigid must admit that he has earned the right\r\nto recreation. A distinguished French naval officer used to say that the\r\nsailor fortunately had no memory. “Happy for him,” said he, “that he is\r\nthus oblivious. Did he remember all the gales and tempests, the cold, the\r\ndrenching rain, the misery, the privations, the peril to life and limb\r\nwhich he has endured, he would never, when he sets foot on shore, go to\r\nsea again. But he has no memory. The clouds roll away, the sea is calm,\r\nthe sun shines, the boat bears him to land; the wine flows; the music\r\nstrikes up; pretty girls smile: he forgets all the past, and lives only in\r\nthe present.”\r\n\r\nWhile the chaplain may, and no doubt generally does, earn the respect and\r\nesteem of the men, woe to any example of the “Chadband” order who shall be\r\nfound on board. This is, in the Royal Navy, almost impossible; but it\r\nsometimes happens that, on passenger ships, some sanctimonious and\r\nfanatical individual or other has had a very rough time of it. He is\r\nregarded as a kind of Jonah. In a recent number of that best of American\r\nmagazines, the _Atlantic Monthly_, the woes and trials of one poor Joseph\r\nPrimrose, a well-meaning minister who went out to America in 1742, are\r\namusingly recounted. There were, aboard the _Polly_, the vessel in which\r\nhe took passage, several of the crew who viewed their religious exercises\r\naskance. “These men,” says he, “had been foremost in a general indignation\r\nuprising that had ensued upon the stoppage of their daily allowance of\r\nrum; which step had been taken on my earnest recommendation. For this\r\ninjurious drink we had substituted a harmless and refreshing beverage\r\nconcocted of molasses, vinegar, and water, from a choice receipt I had\r\ncome upon in a medical book aboard the vessel. The sailors, to a man,\r\nrefused to touch it, egged on by these contumacious fellows, and more\r\nespecially by one Springer, a daring villain, who reviled me with bitter\r\nexecrations. In fine, the captain was obliged, for our own safety, to\r\nrestore the cherished dram; and I had the mortification to find myself,\r\nfrom that time forth, an object of dislike and suspicion to these men, who\r\nwere kept within decent bounds only by respect for their master. I became\r\nconvinced, on reflection, that I had gone the wrong way about this\r\nunfortunate piece of business; having, in fact, made a very serious error\r\nin the beginning, gentle argument and good example being more apt to bring\r\nabout the desired end than compulsory measures, these dulling the\r\nunderstanding by rousing the temper, especially among persons of the\r\nmeaner sort. All my efforts—and they were not few—to place myself on a\r\nfriendly footing with these men were of no avail: they had conceived the\r\nnotion that I was their enemy, and met all my advances with obstinate\r\ncoldness. As Captain Hewlett exacted the daily attendance at prayers of\r\nevery soul on board, these knaves were compelled to be on hand with their\r\nfellows; but they rarely failed to conduct themselves with such indecent\r\nlevity as made me rue their presence, playing covertly at cat’s-cradle,\r\njack-straws, and what not; besides grinning familiarly in my face,\r\nwhenever they could contrive to catch my eye.” This unseemly behaviour was\r\nas nothing to what followed ashore. While addressing a large assemblage,\r\nhe noted the advent of a number of unmannerly fellows, who, with a great\r\ndeal of clatter, elbowed their way to the front. “The moment I clapped\r\neyes upon them,” says poor Primrose, “I knew them for the sailors who had\r\nso persecuted me aboard the _Polly_, and my heart sank at the bare sight\r\nof them.” They sung, or rather bawled, ribald words to the music of the\r\nhymns; and one of them, when rebuked by some gentleman present, whipped\r\nout his cutlass, and a general row ensued, which broke up the assembly. A\r\nlittle later, Primrose induced a tavern-keeper to allow him to preach on\r\nhis premises. “A West Indian vessel coming into port about the middle of\r\nApril, and a horde of roystering sailors gathering in the common room of\r\nthe ‘Sailor’s Rest’ to drink, I announced a discourse on the subject of\r\n‘gin-guzzling,’ choosing one that I had delivered aboard the _Polly_, and\r\nwhich seemed to fit the occasion to a nicety. No sooner had the landlord\r\nseen the notice to this effect that I had attached to his door-cheek, than\r\nhe sends for me to repair to the tavern without loss of time; and on my\r\nappearance, in great haste, comes blustering up to me in a most offensive\r\nmanner, demanding whether I purposed the ruin of his trade, by putting\r\nforth of such a mischievous paper; adding, with astounding audacity, that\r\nhe should certainly lose all the custom I had been the means of fetching\r\nto his house, did I persist in my intent. Mark the cunning of the knave!\r\nHe had encouraged my labours for none other purpose than the bringing of\r\nfresh grist to his mill; and here was I, blindly leading precious souls to\r\ndestruction, the poor dupe of a specious villain—a wretch without bowels!\r\nMy agony of mind on being thus suddenly enlightened was of such a\r\ndesperate sort, that, gnashing my teeth, I leapt upon the miscreant, and,\r\nbearing him to the ground with an awful crash, beat him about the head and\r\nshoulders with the stout cane I carried; and with such good will, that I\r\npresently found myself lying in the town gaol, covered with the blood of\r\nmy enemy, and every bone in my body aching from the unaccustomed\r\nexercise.... Truly was I as forlorn and friendless a creature as the world\r\never saw. My clothing had been rent beyond repair in the shameful\r\nstruggle, and, yet worse, one of my shoes was gone—how and where I knew\r\nnot; and although I promised the gaoler’s little lad a penny in the event\r\nof his finding it, nothing was ever heard of it from that day to this. One\r\nthought alone cheered me in the dark abyss into which I was fallen. I had\r\nadministered wholesome and righteous correction in proper season: hip and\r\nthigh had I hewed my enemy; and, to reflect upon that, was as a healing\r\nbalm to my sore bones.” Mr. Primrose was at length released, and returned\r\nto England.\r\n\r\nAnother officer of the Royal Navy—the engineer—deserves particular notice,\r\nfor his position is becoming daily of more and more importance. It is not\r\nmerely the care and working of the engines which propel the vessel in\r\nwhich he is concerned; the chief and his subordinates have charge of\r\nvarious hydraulic arrangements often used now-a-days on large vessels, in\r\nconnection with the steering apparatus; of electrical and gas-producing\r\napparatus; the mechanical arrangements of turrets and gun-carriages;\r\npumping machinery; the management of steam-launches and torpedoes. Take\r\nthe great ironclad _Thunderer_ (that on which the terrible boiler\r\nexplosion occurred) as an example: she has _twenty-six_ engines for\r\nvarious purposes, apart from the engines used to propel the vessel, which\r\nhave an actual power of 6,000 horses. The _Téméraire_ has _thirty-four_\r\nengines distinct from those required for propulsion. A competent authority\r\nsays that, “with the exception of the paymaster’s and surgeon’s stores, he\r\nis responsible for everything in and outside the ship (meaning the hull,\r\napart from the navigator’s duties), to say nothing of his duties while\r\nunder weigh.” And yet engineers of the navy do not yet either derive the\r\nstatus or emoluments fairly due to them, considering the great and\r\nincreasing responsibilities thrown upon them of late years. Sir Walter\r\nScott makes Rob Roy express “his contempt of weavers and spinners, and\r\nsic-like mechanical persons, and their pursuits;” and in the naval service\r\nsome such feeling still lingers.\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: ENGINE-ROOM OF H.M.S. “WARRIOR.”]\r\n\r\nThe first serious introduction of steam-vessels into the Royal Navy\r\noccurred about the year 1829, the Navy List of that year showing seven, of\r\nwhich three only were commissioned, and these for home ports. No mention\r\nis made of engineers; they were simply taken over from the contractor with\r\nthe vessel, and held no rank whatever. In 1837 an Admiralty Circular\r\nconferred warrants on engineers, _who were to rank immediately below\r\n__carpenters_; they were to be assisted by boys, trained by themselves.\r\nThree years later, the standard was raised, and they were divided into\r\nthree classes; in 1842 a slight increase of pay was given, and they were\r\nadvanced to the magnificent rank of “after captains’ clerks,” and were\r\ngiven a uniform, with buttons having a steam-engine embossed upon them. In\r\n1847 the Government found that the increasing demands of the merchant and\r\npassenger service took all the best men (the engineers’ pay, to-day, is\r\nbetter on first-class steamship lines than in the Navy), and they were\r\nforced to do something. The higher grades were formed into chief\r\nengineers, and they were raised to the rank of commissioned officers,\r\ntaking their place after masters. The first great revolution in regard to\r\nthe use of steam in the Royal Navy took place in 1849, by means of the\r\nscrew-propeller. In that year Dupuy Delorme constructed the _Napoleon_, a\r\nscrew-vessel carrying 100 guns, and with engines of 600 horse-power, and\r\nEngland had to follow. Then came the Russian War, the construction of\r\nironclad batteries, and finally, the ironclad movement, which commenced in\r\nEngland in 1858, by the construction of the _Warrior_ and similar vessels.\r\n\r\nIt becomes a particularly serious question, at the present time, whether\r\nthe system, as regards the rank and pay of engineers, does not deter the\r\nmost competent men from entering the Royal Navy. Many very serious\r\nexplosions and accidents have occurred on board ironclads, which would\r\nseem to indicate that our great commercial steamship lines are far better\r\nengineered. The Admiralty has organised a system for training students at\r\nthe dockyard factories, followed up by a course of study at the Naval\r\nCollege, Greenwich; and it is to be hoped that these efforts will lead to\r\ngreater efficiency in the service. A naval engineer of the present day\r\nneeds to be a man of liberal education, and of considerable scientific\r\nknowledge, both theoretical and practical, and he should then receive on\r\nboard that recognition which his talents would command ashore. At present,\r\na chief engineer, R.N., ranks with a commander, and other engineers with\r\nlieutenants. It is probable that, at some date in the not very distant\r\nfuture, higher ranks will be thrown open to the engineer, as his\r\nimportance on board is steadily increasing.\r\n\r\nThe seamen of all nations, it has, in effect, been said, resemble each the\r\nother more than do the nations to which they belong. “As,” says a\r\nwell-known writer, “the sea receives and amalgamates the waters of all the\r\nrivers which pour into it, so it tends to amalgamate the men who make its\r\nwaves their home.... The seaman from the United States is said to carry to\r\nthe forecastle a large stock of ‘equality and the rights of man,’ and to\r\nbe unpleasantly distinguished by the inbred disrespect for authority which\r\ncleaves, perhaps inseparably, to a democrat who believes that he has\r\nwhipped mankind, and that it is his mission, at due intervals, to whip\r\nthem again. But, on board, he, too, tones down to the colour of blue\r\nwater, and is more a seaman than anything else.” The French sailor is\r\npainted, by Landelle, as the embodiment of the same frolicsome\r\nlightheartedness, carelessness of the future, abandonment to impulse, and\r\ndevotion to his captain, comrades, and ship, with which we are familiar in\r\nthe English sailor, on the stage. But although depicted as much more\r\npolished than, it is to be feared, the average sailor could be in truth,\r\nhe finishes by saying: “Il est toujours prêt à céder le haut du pavé _à\r\ntout autre qu’à un soldat_.” It would seem, then, that the French sailor\r\nrevenges the treatment of society on the soldiers of his country. Is there\r\nnot a similar feeling existing, perhaps to a more limited extent, between\r\nthe sailors and soldiers of our own country? It hardly, however, extends\r\nto the officers of the “United Service.”\r\n\r\nAnother trait of the British sailor’s character: Jack will forgive much to\r\nthe officer who is ever ready, brave, and daring, who is a true seaman in\r\ntimes of peace, and a sailor _militant_ in times of war. Lord Nelson, the\r\nmost heroic seaman the world ever saw, it is pleasant to remember, was\r\nequally the idol of his colleagues, of his subordinate officers, _and of\r\nhis men_ for these very reasons. After he had explained to his captains\r\nhis proposed plan of attack, just prior to the commencement of the battle\r\nof Trafalgar, he took the men of the _Victory_ into his confidence. He\r\nwalked over all the decks, speaking kindly to the different classes of\r\nseamen, and encouraging them, with his usual affability, praising the\r\nmanner in which they had barricaded certain parts of the ship. “All was\r\nperfect, death-like silence, till just before the action began. Three\r\ncheers were given his lordship as he ascended the quarter-deck ladder. He\r\nhad been particular in recommending cool, steady firing, in preference to\r\na hurrying fire, without aim or precision; and the event justified his\r\nlordship’s advice, as the masts of his opponents came tumbling down on\r\ntheir decks and over their sides.”(122) After the fatal bullet had done\r\nits work, and Nelson was conveyed below, the surgeon came and probed the\r\nwound. The ball was extracted; but the dying hero told the medical man how\r\nsure he was that his wound was fatal, and begged, when he had dressed it,\r\nthat he would attend to the other poor fellows, equal sufferers with\r\nhimself. A boatswain’s mate on board the _Brilliant_ frigate, shortly\r\nafterwards, when first acquainted of the death of Nelson, paid a tribute\r\nof affection and honest feeling, which shows how clearly he had gained the\r\nhearts of all. The boatswain’s mate, then doing duty as boatswain, was\r\nordered to pipe all hands to quarters; he did not respond, and the\r\nlieutenant on duty went to inquire the cause. The man had been celebrated\r\nfor his promptness, as well as bravery, but he was found utterly unnerved,\r\nand sobbing like a child. “I can’t do it,” said he—“poor dear fellow, that\r\nI have been in many a hard day with!—and to lose him now! I wouldn’t have\r\ncared so much for my old father, mother, brothers, or sisters; but to\r\nthink of parting with poor Nelson!” and he broke down utterly. The\r\nofficer, honouring his feelings, let him go below. Who does not remember\r\nhow, when the body of Nelson lay in state at Greenwich, a deputation of\r\nthe _Victory’s_ crew paid their last loving respects, tearful and silent,\r\nand could scarcely be removed from the scene? or how, when the two\r\nUnion-Jacks and St. George’s ensign were being lowered into the grave at\r\nSt. Paul’s—the colours shattered as was the body of the dead hero—the\r\nbrave fellows who had borne them each tore off a part of the largest flag,\r\nto remind them ever after of England’s greatest victory and England’s\r\ngreatest loss? Many an otherwise noble and brave officer has utterly\r\nfailed in endearing himself to his men; and there can be no doubt of the\r\nvalue of being thoroughly _en rapport_ with them—the more as it in no way\r\nneed relax discipline. It is an implied compliment to a crew from their\r\ncommander, to be taken, at the proper time, into his confidence. The\r\nfollowing anecdote will show how much an action was decided by this, and\r\nwith how little loss of life.\r\n\r\nThe _Bellona_, of 74 guns and 558 men, with a most valuable freight on\r\nmerchants’ account, and commanded by the celebrated Captain R. Faulkner,\r\nand the _Brilliant_, a 36-gun frigate, Captain Loggie, sailed from the\r\nTagus in August, 1761. When off Vigo, three sail were discovered\r\napproaching the land, and the strangers continued their approach, till\r\nthey found out the character of the English vessels, and then crowded on\r\nall sail, in flight. Upon this, the _Bellona_ and _Brilliant_ pursued,\r\ncoming up with them next morning, to find that they would have to engage\r\none ship of 74 guns, the _Courageux_, with 700 men, and two frigates of 36\r\nguns each, the _Malicieuse_ and _Ermine_. After exchanging a few\r\nbroadsides, the French vessels shot ahead; when Captain Loggie, seeing\r\nthat he could not expect to take either of the smaller vessels, determined\r\nto manœuvre, and lead them such a wild-goose chase, that the _Bellona_\r\nshould have to engage the _Courageux_ alone. During the whole engagement,\r\nhe withstood the united attacks of both the frigates, each of them with\r\nequal force to his own, and at last obliged them to sheer off, greatly\r\ndamaged. Meanwhile, the _Courageux_ and _Bellona_ had approached each\r\nother very fast. The _Courageux_, when within musket-shot, fired her first\r\nbroadside, and there was much impatience on the _Bellona_ to return it;\r\nbut they were restrained by Faulkner, who called out to them to hold hard,\r\nand not to fire till they saw the whites of the Frenchmen’s eyes, adding,\r\n“Take my word for it, they will never stand the singeing of their\r\nwhiskers!” His speech to the sailors just before the action is a model of\r\nsailor-like advice. “Gentlemen, I have been bred a seaman from my youth,\r\nand, consequently, am no orator; but I promise to carry you all near\r\nenough, and then you may speak for yourselves. Nevertheless, I think it\r\nnecessary to acquaint you with the plan I propose to pursue, in taking\r\nthis ship, that you may be the better prepared.... I propose to lead you\r\nclose on the enemy’s larboard quarter, when we will discharge _two_\r\nbroadsides, and then back astern, and range upon the other quarter, and so\r\ntell your guns as you pass. I recommend you at all times to point chiefly\r\nat the quarters, with your guns slanting fore and aft; this is the\r\nprincipal part of a ship. If you kill the officers, break the rudder, and\r\nsnap the braces, she is yours, of course; but, for this reason, I desire\r\nyou may only fire one round of shot and grape above, and two rounds, shot\r\nonly, below. Take care and send them home with exactness. This is a rich\r\nship; they will render you, in return, their weight in gold.” This\r\nprogramme was very nearly carried out; almost every shot took effect. The\r\nFrench still kept up a very brisk fire, and in a moment the _Bellona’s_\r\nshrouds and rigging were almost all cut to pieces, and in nine minutes her\r\nmizen-mast fell over the stern. Undaunted, Faulkner managed to wear his\r\nship round; the officers and men flew to their respective opposite guns,\r\nand carried on, from the larboard side, a fire even more terrible than\r\nthey had hitherto kept up from the starboard guns. “It was impossible for\r\nmortal beings to withstand a battery so incessantly repeated, and so\r\nfatally directed, and, in about twenty minutes from the first shot, the\r\nFrench colours were hauled down, and orders were immediately given in the\r\n_Bellona_ to cease firing, the enemy having struck. The men had left their\r\nquarters, and all the officers were on the quarter-deck, congratulating\r\none another on their victory, when, unexpectedly, a round of shot came\r\nfrom the lower tier of the _Courageux_. It is impossible to describe the\r\nrage that animated the _Bellona’s_ crew on this occasion. Without waiting\r\nfor orders, they flew again to their guns, and in a moment poured in what\r\nthey familiarly termed two ‘comfortable broadsides’ upon the enemy, who\r\nnow called out loudly for quarter, and firing at length ceased on both\r\nsides.” The _Courageux_ was a mere wreck, having nothing but her foremast\r\nand bowsprit standing, several of her ports knocked into one, and her deck\r\nrent in a hundred places. She lost 240 killed, and 110 wounded men were\r\nput ashore at Lisbon. On board the _Bellona_ only _six_ men were killed\r\noutright, and about twenty-eight wounded; the loss of her mizen was her\r\nonly serious disaster.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: FIGHT BETWEEN THE “COURAGEUX” AND THE “BELLONA.”]\r\n\r\nOne more possibility in the officer’s existence, although now nearly\r\nobsolete. The ceremonies formerly attendant on “crossing the line”—_i.e._,\r\npassing over the equator—so often described, have, of late years, been\r\nmore honoured in the breach than in the observance. On merchant vessels\r\nthey had become a nuisance, as the sailors often made them an opportunity\r\nfor levying black mail on timid and nervous passengers. In the Royal Navy,\r\nthey afforded the one chance for “getting even” with unpopular officers;\r\nand very roughly was it sometimes accomplished. They are for this reason\r\nintroduced in this chapter, as the officers had a direct interest in them.\r\nWith trifling exceptions, the programme was as follows. The men stripped\r\nto the waist, wearing only “duck” unmentionables, prepared, immediately\r\nafter breakfast, for the saturnalia of the day—a day when the ship was _en\r\ncarnival_, and discipline relaxed. Early in the day, a man at the\r\nmasthead, peering through a telescope, would announce a boat on the\r\nweather-bow, and soon after, a voice from the jibboom was heard hailing\r\nthe ship, announcing that Neptune wished to come on board. The ship was\r\naccordingly hove-to, when a sailor, in fashionable coat, knee-breeches,\r\nand powdered hair, came aft, and announced to the commander that he was\r\n_gentleman’s gentleman_ to the god of the sea, who desired an interview.\r\nThis accorded, the procession of Neptune from the forecastle at once\r\ncommenced. The triumphal car was a gun-carriage, drawn by half-a-dozen\r\nhalf-naked and grotesquely-painted sailors, their heads covered by wigs of\r\nsea-weed. Neptune was always masked, as were many of his satellites, in\r\norder that the officers should not know who enacted the leading _rôles_.\r\nThe god wore a crown, and held out a trident, on which a dolphin, supposed\r\nto have been impaled that morning, was stuck. He had a flowing wig and\r\nbeard of oakum, and was, in all points, “made-up” for Neptune himself. His\r\nsuite included a secretary of state, his head stuck all over with long\r\nquills; a surgeon, with lancet, pill-box, and medicines; his barber, with\r\na razor cut from an iron hoop, and with an assistant, who carried a tub\r\nfor a shaving-box. Mrs. Neptune was represented by the ugliest man on\r\nboard, who, with sea-weed hair and a huge night-cap, carried a baby—one of\r\nthe boys of the ship—in long clothes; the latter played with a\r\nmarline-spike, given it to assist in cutting its teeth. The nurse\r\nfollowed, with a bucketful of _burgoo_ (thick oatmeal porridge or\r\npudding), and fed the baby incessantly with the cook’s iron ladle.\r\nSea-nymphs, selected from the clumsiest and fattest of the crew, helped to\r\nswell the retinue. As soon as the procession halted before the captain,\r\nbehind whom the steward waited, carrying a tray with a bottle of wine and\r\nglasses, Neptune and Amphitrite paid submission to the former, as\r\nrepresentative of Great Britain, and the god presented him the dolphin.\r\nAfter the interview, in which Neptune not unfrequently poked fun and\r\nthrust home-truths at the officers, the captain offered the god and\r\ngoddess a bumper of wine, and then the rougher part of the ceremony\r\ncommenced. Neptune would address his court somewhat as follows: “Hark ye,\r\nmy Tritons, you’re here to shave and duck and bleed all as needs it; but\r\nyou’ve got to be gentle, or we’ll get no more fees. The first of ye as\r\ndisobeys me, I’ll tie to a ten-ton gun, and sink him ten thousand fathoms\r\nbelow, where he shall drink nothing but salt-water and feed on seaweed for\r\nthe next hundred years.” The cow-pen was usually employed for the\r\nducking-bath; it was lined with double canvas, and boarded up, so as to\r\nhold several butts of water. Marryat, in the first naval novel he wrote,\r\nsays: “Many of the officers purchased exemption from shaving and physic by\r\na bottle of rum; but none could escape the sprinkling of salt water, which\r\nfell about in great profusion; even the captain received his share.... It\r\nwas easy to perceive, on this occasion, who were favourites with the\r\nship’s company, by the degree of severity with which they were treated.\r\nThe tyro was seated on the side of the cow-pen: he was asked the place of\r\nhis nativity, and the moment he opened his mouth the shaving-brush of the\r\nbarber—which was a very large paint-brush—was crammed in, with all the\r\nfilthy lather, with which they covered his face and chin; this was roughly\r\nscraped off with the great razor. The doctor felt his pulse, and\r\nprescribed a pill, which was forced into his cheek; and the\r\nsmelling-bottle, the cork of which was armed with sharp points of pins,\r\nwas so forcibly applied to his nose as to bring blood. After this, he was\r\nthrown backward into the bath, and allowed to scramble out the best way he\r\ncould.” The first-lieutenant, the reader may remember, dodged out of the\r\nway for some time, but at last was surrounded, and plied so effectually\r\nwith buckets of salt water, that he fled down a hatchway. The buckets were\r\npitched after him, “and he fell, like the Roman virgin, covered with the\r\nshields of the soldiers.” Very unpopular men or officers were made to\r\nswallow half a pint of salt water. Those good old times!\r\n\r\nPleasant is it to read of life on board a modern first-class man-of-war.\r\nWhere there are, perhaps, thirty officers in the ward-room, it would be\r\nhard indeed if one cannot find a kindred spirit, while on such a vessel\r\nthe band will discourse sweet music while you dine, and soothe you over\r\nthe walnuts and wine, after the toils of the day, with selections from the\r\nbest operas, waltzes, and quadrilles. Then comes the coffee, and the\r\npost-prandial cigar in the smoking-room. At sea, luncheon is dispensed\r\nwith, and the regular hour is half-past two; but in port both lunch and\r\ndinner are provided, and the officers on leave ashore can return to\r\neither. Say that you have extended your ramble in the country, you will\r\nhave established an appetite by half-past five, the hour when the\r\nofficers’ boat puts off from shore, wharf, or pier. Perhaps the most\r\npleasant evening is the guests’ night, one of which is arranged for every\r\nweek, when the officer can, by notifying the mess caterer, invite a friend\r\nor two. The mess caterer is the officer selected to superintend the\r\nvictualling department, as the wine caterer does the liquid refreshments.\r\nIt is by no means an enviable position, for it is the Englishman’s\r\nconceded right to growl, and sailors are equal to the occasion. Dr.\r\nStables remarks on the unfairness of this under-the-table stabbing, when\r\nmost probably the caterer is doing his best to please. But on a\r\nwell-regulated ship, where the officers are harmonious, and either not\r\nextravagant or with private means, the dinner-hour is the most agreeable\r\ntime in the day. After the cloth has been removed, and the president, with\r\na due preliminary tap on the table to attract attention, has given the\r\nonly toast of the evening—“The Queen”—the bandmaster, who has been peering\r\nin at the door for some minutes, starts the National Anthem at the right\r\ntime, and the rest of the evening is devoted to pleasant intercourse, or\r\nvisits ashore to the places of amusement or houses of hospitable\r\nresidents.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving, for the nonce, the Royal Navy, its officers and men, a few\r\nfacts may be permitted, particularly interesting at the present time. The\r\nnavy, as now constituted, has for its main backbone fifty-four ironclads.\r\nThere are of all classes of vessels no less than 462, but more than a\r\nfourth of these are merely hulks, doing harbour service, &c., while quite\r\na proportion of the remainder—varying according to the exigencies of the\r\ntimes—are out of commission. There are seventy-eight steam gun-boats and\r\nfive fine Indian troop-ships. These numbers are drawn from the official\r\nNavy List of latest date.\r\n\r\nIt is said that since the ironclad movement commenced, not less than\r\n£300,000,000 has been disbursed (in about twenty years) by the different\r\ncountries of the world. Even Japan, Peru, Venezuela, Chili, the Argentine\r\nConfederation, possess many of this class of vessel, of more or less\r\npower. The British fleet, under the command of Vice-Admiral Hornby, in the\r\nMediterranean, &c., though numerically not counting twenty per cent. of\r\nthe fleets in the days of Nelson and Collingwood, when “a hundred sail of\r\nthe line” frequently assembled, has cost infinitely more. A cool half\r\nmillion is not an exceptional cost for an ironclad, while one of the\r\nlatest of our turret-ships, the _Inflexible_, has cost the nation\r\nthree-quarters of a million sterling at the least. She is to carry four\r\neighty-ton guns. A recent correspondent of a daily journal states that\r\nnext to Great Britain, “the ironclad fleet of the Sultan ranks foremost\r\namong the navies of the world.” Be that as it may, there can be little\r\ndoubt that if Russia had succeeded in acquiring it, it would, with her own\r\nfleet, have constituted a very powerful rival.\r\n\r\nThe progressive augmentation in the size of naval vessels has been rapid\r\nin Great Britain. When Henry VIII. constructed his _Henry Grace de Dieu_,\r\nof 1,000 tons,(123) it was, indeed, a great giant among pigmies, for a\r\nvessel of two or three hundred tons was then considered large. At the\r\ndeath of Elizabeth she left forty-two ships, of 17,000 tons in all, and\r\n8,346 men; fifteen of her vessels being 600 tons and upwards. From this\r\nperiod the tonnages of the navy steadily increased. The first really\r\nscientific architect, Mr. Phineas Pett, remodelled the navy to good\r\npurpose in the reigns of James I. and Charles I. Previous to this time the\r\nvessels with their lofty poops and forecastles had greatly resembled\r\nChinese junks. He launched the _Sovereign of the Seas_, a vessel 232 feet\r\nin length, and of a number of tons exactly corresponding to the date,\r\n1637, when she left the slips. Cromwell found a navy of fourteen\r\ntwo-deckers, and left one of 150 vessels, of which one-third were\r\nline-of-battle ships. He was the first to lay naval estimates before\r\nParliament, and obtained £400,000 per annum for the service. James II.\r\nleft 108 ships of the line, and sixty-five other vessels of 102,000 tons,\r\nwith 42,000 men. William III. brought it to 272 ships, of 159,020 tons.\r\nGeorge II. left, in 1760, 412 ships, of 321,104 tons. Twenty-two years\r\nlater the navy had reached 617 vessels, and in 1813 we had the enormous\r\nnumber of 1,000 vessels, of which 256 were of the line, measuring 900,000\r\ntons, carrying 146,000 seamen and marines, and costing £18,000,000 per\r\nannum to maintain. But since the peace of 1815, the number of vessels has\r\ngreatly diminished, while an entirely new era of naval construction has\r\nbeen inaugurated. In the seventeenth century a vessel of 1,500 tons was\r\nconsidered of enormous size. At the end of the eighteenth, 2,500 was the\r\noutside limit, whilst there are now many vessels of 4,000 tons, and the\r\nnavy possesses frigates of 6,000 and upwards. Several of our enormous\r\nironclads have a tonnage of over 11,000 tons, while the _Great Eastern_—of\r\ncourse a _very_ exceptional case—has a tonnage of 22,500.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE “GREAT HARRY” AND “GREAT EASTERN” IN CONTRAST.]\r\n\r\nWhilst we have efficient military volunteers enough to form a grand army,\r\nour naval volunteers do not number more than the contingents for a couple\r\nof large vessels. There are scarcely more than a thousand of the latter,\r\nand only three stations. London, Liverpool, and Brighton divide the honour\r\nbetween them of possessing corps. The writer believes that he will be\r\ndoing a service to many young men—who in their turn may do good service\r\nfor their country—in briefly detailing the conditions and expenses of\r\njoining. In a very short period of time the members have become\r\nwonderfully efficient, and the sailor-like appearance of the men is well\r\nillustrated by the fact, that at a recent reception at the Mansion House a\r\nnumber of them were taken for men-of-war’s men, and so described in\r\nseveral daily journals. Their prowess is illustrated by the prizes\r\ndistributed by Lady Ashley, at the inspection of the 1st London Corps, in\r\nthe West India Docks, on February 9th last. Badges were won by the gunner\r\nmaking the best practice with the heavy gun at sea, and by the marksman\r\nmaking the greatest number of points with the rifle. The “Lord Ashley\r\nchallenge prize,” for the best gun’s crew at sea, was won by fourteen men\r\nof No. 2 battery, who fired forty-two rounds at 1,300 yards in\r\nthirty-seven minutes, scoring 411 points out of a possible 504 points. The\r\nofficial report says:—“that further comment on the men or their instructor\r\nis superfluous.” The list included rifle, battery, and boating prizes.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Navy Artillery Volunteers are raised under an Act passed in\r\n1873, and are directly subject to the authority of the Admiralty. They may\r\nbe assembled for actual employment, their duties then consisting of coast\r\nor harbour service. They are not required to go aloft, or to attend to the\r\nengine fires, but in regard to berthing and messing must conform to the\r\narrangements usual with seamen. The force is formed into brigades, each\r\nbrigade consisting of four or more batteries, of from sixty to eighty men.\r\nEach brigade has a lieutenant-commander, and each battery a\r\nsub-lieutenant, chief petty officer, first and second-class petty\r\nofficers, buglers, &c., while the staff includes a lieutenant-instructor,\r\nfirst-class petty officer instructor, surgeon, bugle-major, and armourer.\r\nThose desiring to join a corps should communicate with the Secretary of\r\nthe Admiralty. The annual subscription to the 1st London Corps is one\r\nguinea, while each member has to provide himself with two white frocks,\r\none blue serge frock, one pair of blue trousers, one blue cloth cap, &c.,\r\nblack handkerchief, flannel, knife, lanyard, and monkey-jacket, costing in\r\nthe neighbourhood of six pounds. When on a cruise, in gunboat, the\r\nvolunteer requires in addition serge trousers and jumpers, flannel shirt,\r\ntowels, and brush and comb, canvas bags, &c. The officers’ uniforms are\r\nthe same as those of the Royal Navy, with the exception of silver, for the\r\nmost part, taking the place of gold. It is more expensive to join the\r\nnaval than the military volunteers, and the class composing the corps are\r\ngenerally well-to-do young men, a large number of them employed in\r\nshipping offices, and mercantile pursuits connected with the sea.\r\n\r\nThe drills consist of practice with great guns, rifle, pistol, and cutlass\r\nexercises. “Efficient” volunteers are entitled to a badge, while men\r\nreturned five times as efficient may wear one star, and those returned ten\r\ntimes two stars, above said badge. Every volunteer must attend at least\r\ntwo drills a month, until he has obtained the standard of an “efficient.”\r\nWhen on actual service, the Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers will receive\r\nthe same pay, allowances, and victuals as those of relative rank in the\r\nnavy, and when embarked on any of Her Majesty’s ships for more than\r\nforty-eight hours, in practice, will either be victualled or receive a\r\nmoney compensation. The cruises in gun-boats, &c., usually last ten days,\r\nand the vessel visits many of the Channel ports, &c., more especially off\r\npoints where gun practice is practicable. A volunteer wounded, either on\r\ndrill or in actual service, is entitled to the same compensation as any\r\nseaman in the navy would be under similar circumstances, and if killed his\r\nwidow (if any) to the same gratuities out of the Greenwich Hospital Funds\r\nas would a Royal Navy seaman’s widow. Members who are able to take\r\nadvantage of the cruise in gun-boats must have attended drill regularly\r\nfor three months previously. It must be remembered that each man costs the\r\nGovernment from £8 to £10 for the first year, in the expenses incurred in\r\ngreat gun and other practice; and it is therefore made a point of honour\r\nto those joining that they will devote sufficient time to their drills to\r\nmake themselves thoroughly efficient.\r\n\r\nThe London Naval Artillery Volunteers have a fine vessel, the _President_,\r\nnow in the West India Docks, on which to exercise, while to accustom them\r\nto living on board ship, the old _Rainbow_, off Temple Pier, is open to\r\nthem, under certain conditions, as a place of residence. A number avail\r\nthemselves of this: sleep on board in hammocks, and contribute their quota\r\nof the mess expenses. The writer is the last to decry other manly\r\nexercises, such as cricket, foot-ball, racing, or pedestrianism, but naval\r\nvolunteering has the advantage of not merely comprising a series of manly\r\nexercises, but in being directly practical and specially health-giving.\r\n\r\nAnd to prevent the need of impressment, the Government did well in\r\nestablishing the Royal Naval Reserve. The latest estimates provided\r\n£140,000 for the year; the number, which at present is about 20,000 men,\r\nis not to exceed 30,000. The service is divided into two classes: the\r\nfirst class consisting of seamen of the merchant service, and the second,\r\nfishermen on the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland. Both divisions are\r\npractical sailors, and the value of their services in a time of war would\r\nbe inestimable. They are required to drill twenty-eight days in each year,\r\nfor which they receive about £6 per annum, and sundry allowances for\r\ntravelling, &c. The former class can be drilled at our stations abroad, so\r\nthat a merchant seaman is not necessarily tied to England, or to mere\r\ncoasting trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE REVERSE OF THE PICTURE—MUTINY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Bligh’s Bread-fruit Expedition—Voyage of the _Bounty_—Otaheite—The\r\n     Happy Islanders—First Appearance of a Mutinous Spirit—The Cutter\r\n       Stolen and Recovered—The _Bounty_ sails with 1,000 Trees—The\r\n        Mutiny—Bligh Overpowered and Bound—Abandoned with Eighteen\r\n    Others—Their Resources—Attacked by Natives—A Boat Voyage of 3,618\r\n     miles—Violent Gales—Miserable Condition of the Boat’s Crew—Bread\r\n      by the Ounce—Rum by the Tea-spoonful—Noddies and Boobies—“Who\r\n    shall have this?”—Off the Barrier Reef—A Haven of Rest—Oyster and\r\n        Palm-top Stews—Another Thousand Miles of Ocean—Arrival at\r\n        Coupang—Hospitality of the Residents—Ghastly Looks of the\r\n      Party—Death of Five of the Number—The _Pandora_ Dispatched to\r\n        Catch the Mutineers—Fourteen in Irons—_Pandora’s_ Box—The\r\n     Wreck—Great Loss of Life—Sentences of the Court Martial—The Last\r\n       of the Mutineers—Pitcairn Island—A Model Settlement—Another\r\n    Example: The greatest Mutiny of History—40,000 Disaffected Men at\r\n     one point—Causes—Legitimate Action of the Men at First—Apathy of\r\n      Government—Serious Organisation—The Spithead Fleet Ordered to\r\n     Sea—Refusal of the Crews—Concessions Made, and the First Mutiny\r\n     Quelled—Second Outbreak—Lord Howe’s Tact—The Great Mutiny of the\r\n     Nore—Richard Parker—A Vile Character but Man of Talent—Wins the\r\n       Men to his Side—Officers Flogged and Ducked—Gallant Duncan’s\r\n     Address—Accessions to the Mutineers—Parker practically Lord High\r\n      Admiral—His Extravagant Behaviour—Alarm in London—The Movement\r\n    Dies out by Degrees—Parker’s Cause Lost—His Execution—Mutinies at\r\n     Other Stations—Prompt Action of Lords St. Vincent and Macartney.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Royal Navy has ever been the glory of our country, but there are spots\r\neven on the bright sun. The service has been presented hitherto almost\r\nentirely under its best aspects. Example after example of heroic bravery,\r\nunmurmuring endurance, and splendid discipline, have been cited. Nor can\r\nwe err in painting it _couleur de rose_, for its gallant exploits have won\r\nit undying fame. But in the service at one time—thank God those times are\r\nhardly possible now—mutiny and desertion on a large scale were\r\neventualities to be considered and dreaded; they were at least remote\r\npossibilities. In a few instances they became terrible facts. In the\r\nmerchant service we still hear of painful examples: every reader will\r\nremember the case of the _Lennie_ mutineers, who murdered the captain and\r\nmates in the Bay of Biscay, with the object of selling the ship in Greece,\r\nand were defeated by the brave steward, who steered for the coast of\r\nFrance, and was eventually successful in communicating with the French\r\nauthorities. The example about to be related is a matter of historical\r\nfact, from which the naval service in particular may still draw most\r\nimportant lessons.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1787, being seventeen years after Captain Cook’s memorable\r\nfirst voyage, a number of merchants and planters resident in London\r\nmemorialised his Majesty George III., that the introduction of the\r\nbread-fruit tree from the southern Pacific Islands would be of great\r\nbenefit to the West Indies, and the king complied with their request. A\r\nsmall vessel, the _Bounty_, was prepared, the arrangements for disposing\r\nthe plants being made by Sir Joseph Banks, long the distinguished\r\nPresident of the Royal Society, and one of the most eminent men of science\r\nof the day. Banks had been with Cook among these very islands; indeed, it\r\nis stated that in his zeal for acquiring knowledge, he had undergone the\r\nprocess of tattooing himself. The ship was put under the command of\r\nLieutenant Bligh, with officers and crew numbering in all forty-four\r\nsouls, to whom were added a practical botanist and assistant.\r\n\r\nThe _Bounty_ sailed from Spithead on December 23rd, 1787 and soon\r\nencountered very severe weather, which obliged them to refit at Teneriffe.\r\nTerrible gales were experienced near Cape Horn, “storms of wind, with hail\r\nand sleet, which made it necessary to keep a constant fire night and day,\r\nand one of the watch always attended to dry the people’s wet clothes. This\r\nstormy weather continued for nine days; the ship required pumping every\r\nhour; the decks became so leaky that the commander was obliged to allot\r\nthe great cabin to those who had wet berths to hang their hammocks\r\nin.”(124) It was at last determined, after vainly struggling for thirty\r\ndays to make headway, to bear away for the Cape of Good Hope. The helm was\r\naccordingly put a-weather, to the great joy and satisfaction of all on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: THE CREW OF H.M.S. “BOUNTY” LANDING AT OTAHEITE.]\r\n\r\nThey arrived at the Cape late in May, and stopped there for thirty-eight\r\ndays, refitting, replenishing provisions, and refreshing the worn-out\r\ncrew. On October 26th they anchored in Matavai Bay, Otaheite, and the\r\nnatives immediately came out to the ship in great numbers. Tinah, the\r\nchief of the district, on hearing of the arrival of the _Bounty_, sent a\r\nsmall pig and a young plantain tree, as a token of friendship, and the\r\nship was liberally supplied with provisions. Handsome presents were made\r\nto Tinah, and he was told that they had been sent to him, on account of\r\nthe kindness of the people to Captain Cook during his visit. “Will you\r\nnot, Tinah,” said Bligh, “send something to King George in return?” “Yes,”\r\nhe replied, “I will send him anything I have,” and then enumerated the\r\ndifferent articles in his power, among which he mentioned the bread-fruit.\r\nThis was exactly what Bligh wished, and he was told that the bread-fruit\r\ntrees were what King George would greatly like, and the chief promised\r\nthat a large number should be placed on board.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the bread-fruit to these people cannot be over-stated.\r\nThat old navigator, Dampier, had well described it a hundred years before.\r\n“The bread-fruit, as we call it, grows on a large tree, as big and high as\r\nour largest apple-trees; it hath a spreading head, full of branches and\r\ndark leaves. The fruit grows on the boughs like apples; it is as big as a\r\npenny loaf when wheat is at five shillings the bushel; it is of a round\r\nshape, and hath a thick, tough rind; when the fruit is ripe, it is yellow\r\nand soft, and the taste is sweet and pleasant. The natives of Guam use it\r\nfor bread. They gather it, when full grown, while it is green and hard;\r\nthen they bake it in an oven, which scorcheth the rind and makes it black,\r\nbut they scrape off the outside black crust, and there remains a tender,\r\nthin crust; and the inside is soft, tender, and white.” The fruit lasts in\r\nseason eight months. During Lord Anson’s two months’ stay at Tinian, no\r\nship’s bread was consumed, the officers and men all preferring the\r\nbread-fruit. Byron speaks of these South Sea Islands, where labour is the\r\nmerest play work, the earth affording nearly spontaneously all that the\r\nnatives need, as\r\n\r\n  “The happy shores without a law,\r\n  *   *   *   *   *   *   *\r\n  Where all partake the earth without dispute,\r\n  And bread itself is gathered as a fruit;\r\n  Where none contest the fields, the woods, the streams,\r\n  The gold-less age, where gold disturbs no dreams.”\r\n\r\nThe Otaheitans of those days were a most harmless, amiable, and\r\nunsophisticated people. One day the gudgeon of the cutter’s rudder was\r\nmissing, and was believed to have been stolen. “I thought,” says Bligh,\r\n“it would have a good effect to punish the boat-keeper in their presence,\r\nand accordingly I ordered him a dozen lashes. All who attended the\r\npunishment interceded very earnestly to get it mitigated; the women showed\r\ngreat sympathy.” The intercourse between the crew and natives was very\r\npleasant. The Otaheitans showed the most perfect ease of manner, with “a\r\ncandour and sincerity about them that is quite refreshing.” When they\r\noffered refreshments, for instance, if they were not accepted, they did\r\nnot press them; they had not the least idea of that ceremonious kind of\r\nrefusal which expects a second invitation. “Having one day,” says Bligh,\r\n“exposed myself too much in the sun, I was taken ill, on which all the\r\npowerful people, both men and women, collected round me, offering their\r\nassistance.” On an occasion when the _Bounty_ had nearly gone ashore in a\r\ntremendous gale of wind, and on another when she did go aground, after all\r\nwas right again, these kind-hearted people came in crowds to congratulate\r\nthe captain on her escape; many of them shed tears while the danger seemed\r\nimminent. In the evenings, the whole beach was like a parade, crowded with\r\nseveral hundred men, women, and children, all good-humoured, and\r\naffectionate to one another; their sports and games were continued till\r\nnear dark, when they peaceably returned to their homes. They were\r\nparticularly cleanly, bathing every morning, and often twice a day.\r\n\r\nIt is sad to turn from this pleasant picture to find the spirit of\r\ndesertion and mutiny appearing among the crew. There can be no doubt that\r\nthe allurements of the island, its charming climate and abundant\r\nproductions, the friendliness of the natives, and ease of living, were the\r\nmain causes. Bligh made one fatal mistake in his long stay of over five\r\nmonths, during which the crew had all opportunities of leave ashore. Every\r\nman of them had his _tayo_, or friend. From the moment he set his foot\r\nashore he found himself in the midst of ease and indolence, all living in\r\na state of luxury, without submitting to anything approaching real labour.\r\nSuch enticements were too much for a common sailor, for must he not\r\ncontrast the islander’s happy lot with his own hardships on board?\r\n\r\nOne morning the small cutter was missing, with three of the crew. They had\r\ntaken with them eight stands of arms and ammunition. The master was\r\ndispatched with one of the chiefs in their pursuit, but before they had\r\ngot any great distance, they met the boat with five of the natives, who\r\nwere bringing her back to the ship. “For this service they were handsomely\r\nrewarded. The chiefs promised to use every possible means to detect and\r\nbring back the deserters, which, in a few days, some of the islanders had\r\nso far accomplished as to seize and bind them, but let them loose again on\r\na promise that they would return to their ship, which they did not exactly\r\nfulfil, but gave themselves up soon after, on a search being made for\r\nthem.” A few days after this it was found that the cable by which the ship\r\nrode had been cut, close to the water’s edge, so that it held by only a\r\nstrand. Bligh considered this the act of one of his own people, who wished\r\nthe ship to go ashore, so that they might remain at Otaheite. It may,\r\nhowever, have chafed in the natural course of affairs.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: THE MUTINEERS SEIZING CAPTAIN BLIGH.]\r\n\r\nAnd now the _Bounty_, having taken on board over a thousand of the\r\nbread-fruit plants, besides other shrubs and fruits, set sail, falling in\r\nsoon after with many canoes, whose owners and passengers sold them hogs,\r\nfowls, and yams, in quantities. Some of the sailing canoes would carry\r\nninety persons. Bligh was congratulating himself on his ship being in good\r\ncondition, his plants in perfect order, and all his men and officers in\r\ngood health. On leaving deck on the evening of April 27th he had given\r\ndirections as to the course and watches. Just before sunrise on the 28th,\r\nwhile he was yet asleep, Mr. Christian, officer of the watch, with three\r\nof the men, came into his cabin, and seizing him, tied his hands behind\r\nhis back, threatening him with instant death if he spoke or made the least\r\nnoise. “I called, however,” says Bligh, “as loud as I could, in hopes of\r\nassistance; but they had already secured the officers who were not of\r\ntheir party, by placing sentinels at their doors. There were three men at\r\nmy cabin-door besides the four within; Christian had only a cutlass in his\r\nhand, the others had muskets and bayonets. I was hauled out of bed, and\r\nforced on deck in my shirt, suffering great pain from the tightness with\r\nwhich they had tied my hands.” The master and master’s mate, the gunner,\r\nand the gardener, were confined below, and the forecastle hatch was\r\nguarded by sentinels. The boatswain was ordered to hoist the launch out,\r\nwith a threat that he had better do it instantly, and two of the\r\nmidshipmen and others were ordered into it. Bligh was simply told, “Hold\r\nyour tongue, sir, or you are dead this instant!” when he remonstrated. “I\r\ncontinued,” says he, “my endeavours to turn the tide of affairs, when\r\nChristian changed the cutlass which he had in his hand for a bayonet that\r\nwas brought to him, and holding me with a strong grip by the cord that\r\ntied my hands, he threatened, with many oaths, to kill me immediately, if\r\nI would not be quiet; the villains round me had their pieces cocked and\r\nbayonets fixed.” The boatswain and seamen who were to be turned adrift\r\nwith Bligh were allowed to collect twine, canvas, lines, sails, cordage,\r\nand an eight-and-twenty gallon cask of water; the clerk secured one\r\nhundred and fifty pounds of bread, with a small quantity of rum and wine,\r\nalso a quadrant and compass, but he was forbidden to touch the maps,\r\nobservations, or any of the surveys or drawings. He did, however, secure\r\nthe journals and captain’s commission. The mutineers having forced those\r\nof the seamen whom they meant to get rid of into the boat, Christian\r\ndirected a dram to be served to each of his own crew. Isaac Martin, one of\r\nthe guard over Bligh, had an inclination to serve him, and fed him with\r\nsome fruit, his lips being quite parched. This kindness was observed, and\r\nMartin was ordered away. The same man, with three others, desired to go\r\nwith the captain, but this was refused. They begged him to remember that\r\nthey had no hand in the transaction. “I asked for arms,” says Bligh, “but\r\nthey laughed at me, and said I was well acquainted with the people among\r\nwhom I was going, and therefore did not want them; four cutlasses,\r\nhowever, were thrown into the boat after we were veered astern.\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: BLIGH CAST ADRIFT.]\r\n\r\n“The officers and men being in the boat, they only waited for me, of which\r\nthe master-at-arms informed Christian, who then said, ‘Come, Captain\r\nBligh, your officers and men are now in the boat, and you must go with\r\nthem; if you attempt to make the least resistance, you will instantly be\r\nput to death;’ and without further ceremony, with a tribe of armed\r\nruffians about me, I was forced over the side, when they untied my hands.”\r\nA few pieces of pork were thrown to them, and after undergoing a great\r\ndeal of ridicule, and having been kept for some time to make sport for\r\nthese unfeeling wretches, they were at length cast adrift in the open sea.\r\nBligh heard shouts of “Huzza for Otaheite!” among the mutineers for some\r\nconsiderable time after they had parted from the vessel.\r\n\r\nIn the boat, well weighted down to the water’s edge, were nineteen\r\npersons, including the commander, master, acting-surgeon, botanist,\r\ngunner, boatswain, carpenter, and two midshipmen. On the ship were\r\ntwenty-five persons, mostly able seamen, but three midshipmen were among\r\nthe number, two of whom had no choice in the matter, being detained\r\nagainst their will.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Bligh, although a good seaman, was a tyrannical man, and had\r\nmade himself especially odious on board by reason of his severity, and\r\nespecially in regard to the issuing of provisions. He had had many\r\ndisputes with Christian in particular, when his language was of the\r\ncoarsest order. Still, the desire to remain among the Otaheitans, or, at\r\nall events, among these enticing islands, seems to have been the main\r\ncause of the mutiny.\r\n\r\nIt was shown afterwards that Christian had only the night before\r\ndetermined to make his escape on a kind of small raft; that he had\r\ninformed four of his companions, and that they had supplied him with part\r\nof a roast pig, some nails, beads, and other trading articles, and that he\r\nabandoned the idea because, when he came on deck to his watch at four\r\na.m., he found an opportunity which he had not expected. He saw Mr.\r\nHayward, the mate of his watch, fall asleep, and the other midshipmen did\r\nnot put in an appearance at all. He suddenly conceived the idea of the\r\nplot, which he disclosed to seven of the men, three of whom had “tasted\r\nthe cat,” and were unfavourable to Bligh. They went to the armourer, and\r\nsecured the keys of his chest, under the pretence of wanting a musket to\r\nfire at a shark, then alongside. Christian then proceeded to secure\r\nLieutenant Bligh, the master, gunner, and botanist. He stated that he had\r\nbeen much annoyed at the frequent abusive and insulting language of his\r\ncommanding officer. Waking out of a short half-hour’s disturbed sleep, to\r\ntake the command of the deck—finding the mates of the watch asleep—the\r\nopportunity tempting, and the ship completely in his power, with a\r\nmomentary impulse he darted down the fore-hatchway, got possession of the\r\narm-chest, and made the hazardous experiment of arming such of the men as\r\nhe deemed he could trust. It is said that he intended to send away his\r\ncaptain in a small, wretched boat, worm-eaten and decayed, but the\r\nremonstrances of a few of the better-hearted induced him to substitute the\r\ncutter.\r\n\r\nAnd now to follow the fortunes of Lieutenant Bligh and his companions.\r\nTheir first consideration was to examine their resources. There were\r\nsixteen pieces of pork, weighing two pounds each, the bread and water as\r\nbefore mentioned, six quarts of rum, and six bottles of wine. Being near\r\nthe island of Tofoa, they resolved to seek a supply of bread-fruit and\r\nwater, so as to preserve their other stock, and they did obtain a small\r\nquantity of the former, but little water. The natives seeing their\r\ndefenceless condition meditated their destruction, and speedily crowded\r\nthe beach, knocking stones together, the preparatory signal for an attack.\r\nWith some difficulty the seamen succeeded in getting their things\r\ntogether, and got all the men, except John Norton, one of the\r\nquartermasters, into the boat, the surf running high. The poor man was\r\nliterally stoned to death within their sight. They pushed out to sea in\r\nall haste, and were followed by volleys of big stones, some of the canoes\r\npursuing them. Their only expedient left to gain time was to throw\r\noverboard some of their clothing, which, fortunately, induced the natives\r\nto stop and pick them up. Night coming on, the canoes returned to the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nThe nearest place where they could expect relief was Timor, a distance of\r\nfull 1,200 leagues, and the men agreed to be put on an allowance, which on\r\ncalculation was found not to exceed _one ounce_ of bread per diem, and a\r\ngill of water. Recommending them, therefore, in the most solemn manner,\r\nnot to depart from their promises, “we bore away,” says Bligh, “across a\r\nsea where the navigation is but little known, in a small boat,\r\ntwenty-three feet long from stem to stern, deeply laden with eighteen\r\nmen.... It was about eight at night on the 2nd of May when we bore away\r\nunder a reefed lug-foresail; and having divided the people into watches,\r\nand got the boat into a little order, we returned thanks to God for our\r\nmiraculous preservation, and in full confidence of His gracious support, I\r\nfound my mind more at ease than it had been for some time past.” Next\r\nmorning the sun rose fiery and red, a sure indication of a gale, and by\r\neight o’clock it blew a violent storm, the waves running so high that\r\ntheir sail was _becalmed_ when between the seas. They lightened the boat\r\nby throwing overboard all superfluous articles, and removing the tools,\r\nput the bread, on which their very existence depended, in the chest.\r\nMiserably wet and cold as were all, Bligh administered a _tea-spoonful_ of\r\nrum to each at dinner time. The sea still rose, and the fatigue of baling\r\nbecame very great. Next morning at daylight the men’s limbs were benumbed,\r\nand another spoonful of spirit was administered. Whatever might be said of\r\nBligh’s previous conduct, there is no doubt that at this juncture he\r\nexerted himself wonderfully and very judiciously to save the lives of all.\r\nTheir dinner this day consisted of five small cocoa-nuts. On the night of\r\nthe 4th the gale abated, and they examined the bread, much of which was\r\nfound to be damaged and rotten, but it was still preserved for use. On the\r\n6th they hooked a fish, “but,” says the commander, “we were miserably\r\ndisappointed by its being lost in trying to get it into the boat.” They\r\nwere terribly cramped for want of room on board, although Bligh did for\r\nthe best by putting them watch and watch, so that half of them at a time\r\ncould lie at the bottom of the boat. On the 7th they passed close to some\r\nrocky isles, from which two large sailing canoes came out and pursued\r\nhotly, but gave over the chase in the afternoon. This day heavy rain fell,\r\nwhen everybody set to work to catch some, with such success that they not\r\nmerely quenched their thirst, but increased their stock to thirty-five\r\ngallons. As a corresponding disadvantage they got wet through. On the 8th\r\nthe allowance issued was an ounce and a half of pork, a tea-spoonful of\r\nrum, half a pint of cocoa-nut milk, and an ounce of bread. Bligh\r\nconstructed a pair of scales of two cocoa-nut shells, using pistol-balls\r\nfor weights. The next nine days brought bad weather, and much rain, the\r\nsea breaking over the boat so much that two men were kept constantly\r\nbaling, and it was necessary to keep the boat before the waves to prevent\r\nher filling. When day broke it showed a miserable set of beings, full of\r\nwants, aches, and pains, and nothing to relieve them. They found some\r\ncomfort by wringing their clothes in sea-water, by which means they found\r\na certain limited amount of warmth. But though all were shivering with\r\ncold and wet, the commander was obliged to tell them that the rum\r\nration—one tea-spoonful—must for the present be discontinued, as it was\r\nrunning low.\r\n\r\n“During the whole of the afternoon of the 21st,” says Bligh, “we were so\r\ncovered with rain and salt water that we could scarcely see. We suffered\r\nextreme cold, and every one dreaded the approach of night. Sleep, though\r\nwe longed for it, afforded no comfort; for my own part, I almost lived\r\nwithout it. * * * The misery we suffered this night exceeded the\r\npreceding. The sea flew over us with great force, and kept us baling with\r\nhorror and anxiety. At dawn of day I found every one in a most distressed\r\ncondition, and I began to fear that another such night would put an end to\r\nthe lives of several, who seemed no longer able to support their\r\nsufferings. I served an allowance of two tea-spoonfuls of rum; after\r\ndrinking which, and having wrung our clothes, and taken our breakfast of\r\nbread and water, we became a little refreshed.” On the 24th, for the first\r\ntime in fifteen days, they experienced the warmth of the sun, and dried\r\ntheir now threadbare garments.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th, at mid-day, some noddies flew so near the boat that one was\r\ncaught by hand. This bird, about the size of a small pigeon, was divided\r\ninto eighteen portions, and allotted by the method known as _“__Who shall\r\nhave this?__”_ in which one person, who turns his back to the caterer, is\r\nasked the question, as each piece is indicated. This system gives every\r\none the chance of securing the best share. Bligh used to speak of the\r\namusement it gave the poor half-starved people when the beak and claws\r\nfell to his lot. That and the following day two boobies, which are about\r\nas large as ducks, were also caught. The sun came out so powerfully that\r\nseveral of the people were seized with faintness. But the capture of two\r\nmore boobies revived their spirits, and as from the birds, and other\r\nsigns, Mr. Bligh had no doubt they were near land, the feelings of all\r\nbecame more animated. On the morning of the 28th the “barrier reef” of\r\nwhat was then known as the eastern coast of New Holland, now Australia,\r\nappeared, with the surf and breakers outside, and smooth water within. The\r\ndifficulty was to find a passage; but at last a fine opening was\r\ndiscovered, and through this the boat passed rapidly with a strong stream,\r\nand came immediately into smooth water. Their past hardships seemed all at\r\nonce forgotten. The coast appeared, and in the evening they landed on the\r\nsandy point of an island, where they soon found that the rocks were\r\ncovered with oysters, and that plenty of fresh water was attainable. By\r\nhelp of a small sun-glass a fire was made, and soon a stew of oysters,\r\npork, and bread was concocted, which gladdened their hearts, each\r\nreceiving a full pint. The 29th of May being the anniversary of the\r\nrestoration of Charles II., the spot was not inappropriately named\r\nRestoration Island.\r\n\r\nBligh soon noted the alteration for the better in the looks of his men,\r\nwhich proved the value of oysters, stewed, as they sometimes were, with\r\nfresh green palm-tops. Strange to say, that the mutinous spirit, which had\r\nbeen satisfactorily absent before, broke out in one or two of the men, and\r\nBligh had, in one instance, to seize a cutlass and order the man to defend\r\nhimself. The threatened outbreak ended quietly.\r\n\r\nBut although the worst of their voyage was over, their troubles in other\r\nways were serious. While among the islands off the coast of Australia\r\nseveral of them were seriously affected with weakness, dizziness, and\r\nviolent pains in their bowels. Infinitesimal quantities of wine were\r\nadministered, to their great benefit. A party was sent out on one of the\r\nislands to catch birds, and they returned with a dozen noddies; these and\r\na few clams were all they obtained. On the 3rd of June they left Cape\r\nYork, and once more launched their little boat on the open ocean. On the\r\n5th a booby was caught by the hand, the blood of which was divided among\r\nthree of the men who were weakest, and the bird kept for next day’s\r\ndinner. The following day the sea ran high, and kept breaking over the\r\nboat. Mr. Ledward, the surgeon, and Lebogue, an old hardy sailor, appeared\r\nto be breaking up fast, and no other assistance could be given them than a\r\ntea-spoonful or two of wine. On the morning of the 10th there was a\r\nvisible alteration for the worse in many of the people. Their countenances\r\nwere ghastly and hollow, their limbs swollen, and all extremely\r\ndebilitated; some seeming to have lost their reason. But next day Bligh\r\nwas able to announce that they had passed the meridian of Timor, and the\r\nfollowing morning land was sighted with expressions of universal joy and\r\nsatisfaction. Forty-one days had they been on the ocean in their miserable\r\nboat, and by the log they had run 3,618 nautical miles. On the 14th they\r\narrived at Coupang Bay, where they were received with all kinds of\r\nhospitality. The party on landing presented the appearance of spectres:\r\ntheir bodies skin and bones, and covered with sores; their clothing in\r\nrags. But the strain had been too much for several of them. The botanist\r\ndied at Coupang, three of the men at Batavia, and one on the passage home.\r\nThe doctor was left behind and not afterwards heard of. Bligh arrived in\r\nEngland on March 14th, and received much sympathy. He was immediately\r\npromoted, and afterwards successfully carried the bread-fruit tree to the\r\nWest Indies. Meantime the Government naturally proposed to bring the\r\nmutineers to trial, whatever it might cost.\r\n\r\nThe _Pandora_, a frigate of twenty-four guns, and one hundred and sixty\r\nmen, was selected for the service, and was placed under the command of\r\nCaptain Edward Edwards, with orders to proceed to Otaheite, and if\r\nnecessary the other islands. The voyage was destined to end in shipwreck\r\nand disaster, but the captain succeeded in securing a part of the\r\nmutineers, of whom ten were brought to England, and four drowned on the\r\nwreck.\r\n\r\nThe _Pandora_ reached Matavia Bay on the 23rd of March, 1791. The armourer\r\nand two of the midshipmen, Mr. Heywood and Mr. Stewart, came off\r\nimmediately, and showed their willingness to afford information. Four\r\nothers soon after appeared, and from them the captain learned that the\r\nrest of the _Bounty’s_ people had built a schooner, and sailed the day\r\nbefore for another part of the island. They were pursued, and the schooner\r\nsecured, but the mutineers had fled to the mountains. A day or two\r\nelapsed, when they ventured down, and when within hearing were ordered to\r\nlay down their arms, which they did, and were put in irons. Captain\r\nEdwards put them into a round-house, built on the after part of the\r\nquarter-deck, in order to isolate them from the crew. According to the\r\nstatement of one of the prisoners, the midshipmen were kept ironed by the\r\nlegs, separate from the men, in a kind of round-house, aptly termed\r\n“Pandora’s Box,” which was entered by a scuttle in the roof, about\r\neighteen inches square. “The prisoners’ wives visited the ship daily, and\r\nbrought their children, who were permitted to be carried to their unhappy\r\nfathers. To see the poor captives in irons,” says the only narrative\r\npublished of the _Pandora’s_ visit, “weeping over their tender offspring,\r\nwas too moving a scene for any feeling heart. Their wives brought them\r\nample supplies of every delicacy that the country afforded while we lay\r\nthere, and behaved with the greatest fidelity and affection to them.”(125)\r\nStewart, the midshipman, had espoused the daughter of an old chief, and\r\nthey had lived together in the greatest harmony; a beautiful little girl\r\nhad been the fruit of the union. When Stewart was confined in irons,\r\nPeggy, for so her husband had named her, flew with her infant in a canoe\r\nto the arms of her husband. The interview was so painful that Stewart\r\nbegged she might not be admitted on board again. Forbidden to see him, she\r\nsank into the greatest dejection, and seemed to have lost all relish for\r\nfood and existence; she pined away and died two months afterwards.(126)\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: MAP OF THE ISLANDS OF THE PACIFIC.]\r\n\r\nAll the mutineers that were left on the island having been secured, the\r\nship proceeded to other islands in search of those who had gone away in\r\nthe _Bounty_. It must be mentioned, however, that two of the men had\r\nperished by violent deaths. They had made friends with a chief, and one of\r\nthem, Churchill, was his _tayo_, or sworn friend. The chief died suddenly\r\nwithout issue, and Churchill, according to the custom of the country,\r\nsucceeded to his property and dignity. The other, Thomson, murdered\r\nChurchill, probably to acquire his possessions, and was in his turn stoned\r\nto death by the natives. Captain Edwards learned that after Bligh had been\r\nset adrift, Christian had thrown overboard the greater part of the\r\nbread-fruit plants, and divided the property of those they had abandoned.\r\nThey at first went to an island named Toobouai, where they intended to\r\nform a settlement, but the opposition of the natives, and their own\r\nquarrels, determined them to revisit Otaheite. There the leading natives\r\nwere very curious to know what had become of Bligh and the rest, and the\r\nmutineers invented a story to the effect that they had unexpectedly fallen\r\nin with Captain Cook at an island he had just discovered, and that\r\nLieutenant Bligh was stopping with him, and had appointed Mr. Christian\r\ncommander of the _Bounty_; and, further, he was now come for additional\r\nsupplies for them. This story imposed upon the simple-minded natives, and\r\nin the course of a very few days the _Bounty_ received on board\r\nthirty-eight goats, 312 hogs, eight dozen fowls, a bull and a cow, and\r\nlarge quantities of fruit. They also took with them a number of natives,\r\nmale and female, intending to form a settlement at Toobouai. Skirmishes\r\nwith the natives, generally brought on by their own violent conduct or\r\nrobberies, and eternal bickerings among themselves, delayed the progress\r\nof their fort, and it was subsequently abandoned, sixteen of the men\r\nelecting to stop at Otaheite, and the remaining nine leaving finally in\r\nthe _Bounty_, Christian having been heard frequently to say that his\r\nobject was to find some uninhabited island, in which there was no harbour,\r\nthat he would run the ship ashore, and make use of her materials to form a\r\nsettlement. This was all that Captain Edwards could learn, and after a\r\nfruitless search of three months he abandoned further inquiry, and\r\nproceeded on his homeward voyage.\r\n\r\nOff the east coast of New Holland, the _Pandora_ ran on a reef, and was\r\nspeedily a wreck. In an hour and a half after she struck, there were eight\r\nand a half feet of water in her hold, and in spite of continuous pumping\r\nand baling, it became evident that she was a doomed vessel. With all the\r\nefforts made to save the crew, thirty-one of the ship’s company and four\r\nmutineers were lost with the vessel. Very little notice, indeed, seems to\r\nhave been taken of the latter by the captain, who was afterwards accused\r\nof considerable inhumanity. “Before the final catastrophe,” says the\r\nsurgeon of the vessel, “three of the _Bounty’s_ people, Coleman, Norman,\r\nand M’Intosh, were now let out of irons, and sent to work at the pumps.\r\nThe others offered their assistance, and begged to be allowed a chance of\r\nsaving their lives; instead of which, two additional sentinels were placed\r\nover them, with orders to shoot any who should attempt to get rid of their\r\nfetters. Seeing no prospect of escape, they betook themselves to prayer,\r\nand prepared to meet their fate, every one expecting that the ship would\r\nsoon go to pieces, her rudder and part of the stern-post being already\r\nbeaten away.” When the ship was actually sinking, it is stated that no\r\nnotice was taken of the prisoners, although Captain Edwards was entreated\r\nby young Heywood, the midshipman, to have mercy on them, when he passed\r\nover their prison to make his own escape, the ship then lying on her\r\nbroadside with the larboard bow completely under water. Fortunately, the\r\nmaster-at-arms, either by accident, or probably design, when slipping from\r\nthe roof of “Pandora’s Box” into the sea, let the keys unlocking the\r\nhand-cuffs and irons fall through the scuttle, and thus enabled them to\r\ncommence their own liberation, in which they were assisted by one brave\r\nseaman, William Moulter, who said he would set them free or go to the\r\nbottom with them. He wrenched away, with great difficulty, the bars of the\r\nprison. Immediately after the ship went down, leaving nothing visible but\r\nthe top-mast cross-trees.\r\n\r\nMore than half an hour elapsed before the survivors were all picked up by\r\nthe boats. Amongst the drowned were Mr. Stewart, the midshipman, and three\r\nothers of the _Bounty’s_ people, the whole of whom perished with the\r\nmanacles on their hands. Thirty-one of the ship’s company were lost. The\r\nfour boat-loads which escaped had scarcely any provisions on board, the\r\nallowance being two wine-glasses of water to each man, and a very small\r\nquantity of bread, calculated for sixteen days. Their voyage of 1,000\r\nmiles on the open ocean, and the sufferings endured, were similar to those\r\nexperienced by Bligh’s party, but not so severe. After staying at Coupang\r\nfor about three weeks, they left on a Dutch East Indiaman, which conveyed\r\nthem to Samarang, and subsequently Batavia, whence they proceeded to\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nAfter an exhaustive court-martial had been held on the ten prisoners\r\nbrought home by Captain Edwards, three of the seamen were condemned and\r\nexecuted; Mr. Heywood, the midshipman, the boatswain’s-mate, and the\r\nsteward were sentenced to death, but afterwards pardoned; four others were\r\ntried and acquitted. It will be remembered that four others were drowned\r\nat the wreck.\r\n\r\nTwenty years had rolled away, and the mutiny of the _Bounty_ was almost\r\nforgotten, when Captain Folger, of the American ship _Topaz_, reported to\r\nSir Sydney Smith, at Valparaiso, that he had discovered the last of the\r\nsurvivors on Pitcairn Island. This fact was transmitted to the Admiralty,\r\nand received on May 14th, 1809, but the troublous times prevented any\r\nimmediate investigation. In 1814, H.M.S. _Briton_, commanded by Sir Thomas\r\nStaines, and the _Tagus_, Captain Pipon, were cruising in the Pacific,\r\nwhen they fell in with the little known island of Pitcairn. He discovered\r\nnot merely that it was inhabited, but afterwards, to his great\r\nastonishment, that every individual on the island spoke very good English.\r\nThe little village was composed of neat huts, embowered in luxuriant\r\nplantations. “Presently they observed a few natives coming down a steep\r\ndescent with their canoes on their shoulders, and in a few minutes\r\nperceived one of these little vessels dashing through a heavy surf, and\r\npaddling off towards the ships; but their astonishment was extreme when,\r\non coming alongside, they were hailed in the English language with ‘Won’t\r\nyou heave us a rope now?’\r\n\r\n“The first young man that sprang with extraordinary alacrity up the side\r\nand stood before them on the deck, said, in reply to the question, ‘Who\r\nare you?’ that his name was Thursday October Christian, son of the late\r\nFletcher Christian, by an Otaheitan mother; that he was the first born on\r\nthe island, and that he was so called because he was brought into the\r\nworld on a Thursday in October. Singularly strange as all this was to Sir\r\nThomas Staines and Captain Pipon, this youth soon satisfied them that he\r\nwas none other than the person he represented himself to be, and that he\r\nwas fully acquainted with the whole history of the _Bounty_; and, in\r\nshort, the island before them was the retreat of the mutineers of that\r\nship. Young Christian was, at this time, about twenty-four years of age, a\r\nfine tall youth, full six feet high, with dark, almost black hair, and a\r\ncountenance open and extremely interesting. As he wore no clothes, except\r\na piece of cloth round his loins, and a straw hat, ornamented with black\r\ncock’s feathers, his fine figure, and well-shaped muscular limbs, were\r\ndisplayed to great advantage, and attracted general admiration. * * * He\r\ntold them that he was married to a woman much older than himself, one of\r\nthose that had accompanied his father from Otaheite. His companion was a\r\nfine, handsome youth of seventeen or eighteen years of age, of the name of\r\nGeorge Young, the son of Young, the midshipman.” In the cabin, when\r\ninvited to refreshments, one of them astonished the captains by asking the\r\nblessing with much appearance of devotion, “For what we are going to\r\nreceive, the Lord make us truly thankful.” The only surviving Englishman\r\nof the crew was John Adams, and when the captains landed through the surf,\r\nwith no worse result than a good wetting, the old man came down to meet\r\nthem. Both he and his aged wife were at first considerably alarmed at\r\nseeing the king’s uniform, but was reassured when he was told that they\r\nhad no intention of disturbing him. Adams said that he had no great share\r\nin the mutiny, that he was sick at the time, and was afterwards compelled\r\nto take a musket. He even expressed his willingness to go to England, but\r\nthis was strongly opposed by his daughter. “All the women burst into\r\ntears, and the young men stood motionless and absorbed in grief; but on\r\ntheir being assured that he should on no account be molested, it is\r\nimpossible,” says Pipon, “to describe the universal joy that these poor\r\npeople manifested.”\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: H.M.S. “BRITON,” AT PITCAIRN ISLAND.]\r\n\r\nWhen Christian had arrived at the island, he found no good anchorage, so\r\nhe ran the _Bounty_ into a small creek against the cliff, in order to get\r\nout of her such articles as might be of use. Having stripped her, he set\r\nfire to the hull, so that afterwards she should not be seen by passing\r\nvessels, and his retreat discovered. It is pretty clear that the misguided\r\nyoung man was never happy after the rash and mutinous step he had taken,\r\nand he became sullen, morose, and tyrannical to his companions. He was at\r\nlength shot by an Otaheitan, and in a short time only two of the mutineers\r\nwere left alive.\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: PITCAIRN ISLAND.]\r\n\r\nThe colony at this time comprised forty-six persons, mostly grown-up young\r\npeople, all of prepossessing appearance. John Adams had made up for any\r\nshare he may have had in the revolt, by instructing them in religious and\r\nmoral principles. The girls were modest and bashful, with bright eyes,\r\nbeautifully white teeth, and every indication of health. They carried\r\nbaskets of fruit over such roads and down such precipices as were scarcely\r\npassable by any creatures except goats, and over which we could scarcely\r\nscramble with the help of our hands. When Captain Beechey, in his\r\nwell-known voyage of discovery on the _Blossom_, called there in 1825, he\r\nfound Adams, then in his sixty-fifth year, dressed in a sailor’s shirt and\r\ntrousers, and with all a sailor’s manners, doffing his hat and smoothing\r\ndown his bald forehead whenever he was addressed by the officers of the\r\n_Blossom_. Many circumstances connected with the subsequent history of the\r\nhappy little colony cannot be detailed here. Suffice it to say that it\r\nstill thrives, and is one of the most model settlements of the whole\r\nworld, although descended from a stock so bad. Of the nine who landed on\r\nPitcairn’s Island only two died a natural death. Of the original officers\r\nand crew of the _Bounty_ more than half perished in various untimely ways,\r\nthe whole burden of guilt resting on Christian and his\r\nfellow-conspirators.\r\n\r\nThe mutiny just described sinks into insignificance before that which is\r\nabout to be recounted, the greatest mutiny of English history—that of the\r\nNore. At that one point no less than 40,000 men were concerned, while the\r\ndisaffection spread to many other stations, some of them far abroad. There\r\ncan be little doubt that prior to 1797, the year of the event, our sailors\r\nhad laboured under many grievances, while the navy was full of “pressed”\r\nmen, a portion of whom were sure to retain a thorough dislike to the\r\nservice, although so many fought and died bravely for their country. Some\r\nof the grievances which the navy suffered were probably the result of\r\ncareless and negligent legislation, rather than of deliberate injustice,\r\nbut they were none the less galling on that account. The pay of the sailor\r\nhad remained unchanged from the reign of Charles II., although the prices\r\nof the necessaries and common luxuries of life had greatly risen. His\r\npension had also remained at a stationary rate; that of the soldier had\r\nbeen augmented. On the score of provisions he was worse off than an\r\nordinary pauper. He was in the hands of the purser, whose usual title at\r\nthat time indicates his unpopularity: he was termed “Nipcheese.” The\r\nprovisions served were of the worst quality; fourteen instead of sixteen\r\nounces went to the navy pound. The purser of those days was taken from an\r\ninferior class of men, and often obtained his position by influence,\r\nrather than merit. He generally retired on a competency after a life of\r\ndeliberate dishonesty towards the defenders of his country, who, had they\r\nreceived everything to which they were entitled, would not have been too\r\nwell treated, and, as it was, were cheated and robbed, without scruple and\r\nwithout limit. The reader will recall the many naval novels, in which poor\r\nJack’s daily allowance of grog was curtailed by the purveyor’s thumb being\r\nput in the pannikin: this was the least of the evils he suffered. In those\r\nwar times the discipline of the service was specially rigid and severe,\r\nand most of this was doubtless necessary. Men were not readily obtained in\r\nsufficient numbers; consequently, when in harbour, leave ashore was very\r\nconstantly refused, for fear of desertions. These and a variety of other\r\ngrievances, real or fancied, nearly upset the equilibrium of our entire\r\nnavy. It is not too much to say that not merely England’s naval supremacy\r\nwas for a time in the greatest jeopardy through the disaffection of the\r\nmen, but that our national existence, almost—and most certainly our\r\nexistence as a first-class power—was alarmingly threatened, the cause\r\nbeing nothing more nor less than a very general spirit of mutiny. To do\r\nthe sailors justice, they sought at first to obtain fair play by all\r\nlegitimate means in their power. It must be noted, also, that a large\r\nnumber of our best officers knew that there was very general discontent.\r\nFurthermore, it was well known on shore that numerous secret societies\r\nopposed to monarchy, and incited by the example of the French Revolution,\r\nhad been established. Here, again, the Government had made a fatal\r\nmistake. Members of these societies had been convicted in numbers, and\r\nsent to sea as a punishment. These men almost naturally became ringleaders\r\nand partakers in the mutiny, which would, however, have occurred sooner or\r\nlater, under any circumstances. In the case of the mutiny at Spithead,\r\nabout to be recounted, the sailors exhibited an organisation and an amount\r\nof information which might have been expected from “sea-lawyers” rather\r\nthan ordinary Jack Tars; while in the more serious rebellion of the Nore,\r\nthe co-operation of other agents was established beyond doubt.\r\n\r\nThe first step taken by the men was perfectly legitimate, and had it been\r\nmet in a proper spirit by the authorities, this history need never have\r\nbeen penned. At the end of February, 1797, the crews of four\r\nline-of-battle ships at Spithead addressed separate petitions to Lord\r\nHowe, Commander-in-Chief of the Channel Fleet, asking his kind\r\ninterposition with the Admiralty, to obtain from them a relief of their\r\ngrievances, so that they might at length be put on a similar footing to\r\nthe army and militia, in respect both of their pay and of the provision\r\nthey might be enabled to make for their wives and families. Lord Howe,\r\nbeing then in bad health, communicated the subject of their petitions to\r\nLord Bridport and Sir Peter Parker, the port admiral, who, with a want of\r\nforesight and disregard of their country’s interest which cannot be\r\nexcused, returned answer that “the petitions were the work of some\r\nevil-disposed person or persons,” and took no trouble to investigate the\r\nallegations contained in them. Lord Howe, therefore, did nothing; and the\r\nseamen, finding their applications for redress not only disregarded, but\r\ntreated with contempt, determined to compel the authorities to give them\r\nthat relief which they had before submissively asked.\r\n\r\nIn about six weeks they organised their plans with such secrecy that it\r\nwas not till everything was arranged on a working basis that the first\r\nadmiral, Lord Bridport, gained any knowledge of the conspiracy going on\r\naround him. He communicated his suspicions to the Lords of the Admiralty;\r\nand they, thinking a little active service would prove the best cure for\r\nwhat they simply regarded as a momentary agitation, sent down orders for\r\nthe Channel Fleet to put to sea. The orders arrived at Portsmouth on April\r\n15th, and in obedience to them Lord Bridport signalled to the fleet to\r\nmake the necessary preparations. As might almost have been expected, it\r\nwas the signal, likewise, for the outbreak of the mutiny. Not a sailor\r\nbestirred himself; not a rope was bent; but, as if by common consent, the\r\ncrews of every vessel in the squadron manned the yards and rigging, and\r\ngave three cheers. They then proceeded to take the command of each ship\r\nfrom the officers, and appointed delegates from each vessel to conduct\r\nnegotiations with the authorities of the Admiralty. No violence nor force\r\nwas used. The first-lieutenant of the _London_, ordered by Admiral\r\nColpoys, one of the best-hated officers of the service, shot one of the\r\nmutineers, but his death was not avenged. They again forwarded their\r\npetition to the Admiralty, and its closing sentences showed their\r\ntemperance, and argued strongly in favour of their cause. They desired “to\r\nconvince the nation at large that they knew where to cease to ask, as well\r\nas where to begin; and that they asked nothing but what was moderate, and\r\nmight be granted without detriment to the nation or injury to the\r\nservice.” The Admiralty authorities, seeing that with the great power in\r\ntheir hands they had acted peaceably, only abstaining from work, yielded\r\nall the concessions asked; and a full pardon was granted in the king’s\r\nname to the fleet in general, and to the ringleaders in particular. In a\r\nword, the mutiny ended for the time being.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: THE MUTINY AT PORTSMOUTH.]\r\n\r\nIt was resumed on May 7th. As Parliament had delayed in passing the\r\nappropriations for the increase of pay and pensions, the crews rose _en\r\nmasse_ and disarmed all their officers, although still abstaining from\r\nactual violence. Lord Howe, always a popular officer with the men, and\r\ntheir especial idol after his great victory of June 1st, 1794, was sent\r\ndown by the Cabinet with full power to ratify all the concessions which\r\nhad been made, and to do his best to convince the men that the Government\r\nhad no desire of evading them. He completely mollified the men, and even\r\nsucceeded in exacting an expression of regret and contrition for their\r\noutbreak. He assured them that their every grievance should be considered,\r\nand a free pardon, as before, given to all concerned. The men again\r\nreturned to duty. The fleet at Plymouth, which had followed that of\r\nPortsmouth into the mutiny, did the same; and thus, in a month from the\r\nfirst outbreak, as far as these two great fleets were concerned, all\r\ndisaffection, dissatisfaction, and discontent had passed away, through the\r\ntact and judicious behaviour of Lord Howe. There can be no doubt that the\r\ntyranny of many of the officers had a vast deal to do with the outbreak.\r\nIn the list of officers whom the men considered obnoxious, and that Lord\r\nHowe agreed should be removed, there were over one hundred in one fleet of\r\nsixteen ships.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the very same week in which the men of the Portsmouth\r\nfleet returned to their duty, acknowledging all their grievances to be\r\nremoved, the fleet at the Nore arose in a violent state of mutiny,\r\ndisplaying very different attributes to those shown by the former. Forty\r\nthousand men, who had fought many a battle for king and country, and in\r\nsteadfast reliance upon whose bravery the people rested every night in\r\ntranquillity, confident in their patriotism and loyalty, became irritated\r\nby ungrateful neglect on the one part, and by seditious advisers on the\r\nother, and turned the guns which they had so often fired in defence of the\r\nEnglish flag against their own countrymen and their own homes.\r\n\r\nRichard Parker, the chief ringleader at the Nore, was a thoroughly bad man\r\nin every respect, and one utterly unworthy the title of a British sailor,\r\nof which, indeed, he had been more than once formally deprived. He was the\r\nson of an Exeter tradesman in a fair way of business, had received a good\r\neducation, and was possessed of decided abilities. He was a remarkably\r\nbold and resolute man, or he would never have acquired the hold he had for\r\na time over so many brave sailors. He was unmistakably\r\n\r\n  “The leader of the band he had undone,\r\n  Who, born for better things, had madly set\r\n  His life upon a _cast_,”\r\n\r\nand until overtaken by justice, he ruled with absolute sway.\r\n\r\nParker had, eleven years previously, entered the navy as a midshipman on\r\nboard the _Culloden_, from which vessel he had been discharged for gross\r\nmisconduct. A little later, he obtained, however, a similar appointment on\r\nthe _Leander_ frigate, and was again dismissed. We next find him passing\r\nthrough several ships in rotation, from which he was invariably dismissed,\r\nno captain allowing him to remain when his true character disclosed\r\nitself. It did not usually take long. At length he became mate of the\r\n_Resistance_, on which vessel, shortly after joining, he was brought to a\r\ncourt-martial and “broke”—_i.e._, his commission taken away—and declared\r\nincapable of serving again as an officer. After serving a short time as a\r\ncommon sailor on board the _Hebe_, he was either invalided or discharged,\r\nfor we find him residing in Scotland; and as he could no more keep out of\r\ntrouble ashore than he could afloat, he was soon in Edinburgh gaol for\r\ndebt. But men were wanted for the navy, and he was eventually sent up to\r\nthe fleet as one of the quota of men required from Perth district. He\r\nreceived the parochial bounty of £30 allowed to each man. He joined the\r\n_Sandwich_, the flag-ship of Admiral Buckner, Commander-in-Chief at the\r\nNore. The best authorities believe him to have been employed as an\r\nemissary of the revolutionists, as, although he had only just been\r\ndischarged from gaol, he had abundance of money. His good address and\r\ngeneral abilities, combined with the liberality and conviviality he\r\ndisplayed, speedily obtained him an influence among his messmates, which\r\nhe used to the worst purpose. He had scarcely joined the fleet when, aided\r\nby disaffected parties ashore, he began his machinations, and speedily\r\nseduced the majority of the seamen from their duty. In some respects the\r\nmen followed the example of those at Portsmouth, selecting delegates and\r\nforwarding petitions, but in other respects their conduct was\r\ndisgracefully different. When mastery of the officers had been effected,\r\nParker became, in effect, Lord High Admiral, and committed any number of\r\nexcesses, even firing on those ships which had not followed the movement.\r\nOfficers were flogged, and on board the flag-ship, the vessel on which\r\nParker remained, many were half-drowned, as the following account, derived\r\nfrom an unimpeachable source,(127) will show. Their hammocks were fastened\r\nto their backs, with an 18-pounder bar-shot as a weight; their hands were\r\ntied together, likewise their feet. They were then made fast to a tackle\r\nsuspended from a yard-arm, and hauled up almost to the block; at the word\r\nof command they were dropped suddenly in the sea, where they were allowed\r\nto remain a minute. They were again hoisted up, and the process repeated,\r\nuntil about every sign of life had fled. The unfortunate victims were then\r\nhoisted up by the heels; this was considerately done to get rid of the\r\nwater from their stomachs. They were then put to bed in their wet\r\nhammocks.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: ADMIRAL DUNCAN ADDRESSING HIS CREW.]\r\n\r\nOn June 6th the mutinous fleet was joined by the _Agamemnon_, _Leopard_,\r\n_Ardent_, and _Iris_ men-of-war, and the _Ranger_ sloop, which vessels\r\nbasely deserted from a squadron under Admiral Duncan, sent to blockade the\r\nTexel. Shortly after, a number of vessels of the line arrived at the mouth\r\nof the Thames, and still further augmented the ranks of the mutineers. By\r\nthis means eleven vessels were added to the list. Duncan, gallant old salt\r\nas he was, when he found himself deserted by the greater part of his\r\nfleet, called his own ship’s crew (the _Venerable_, 74) together, and\r\naddressed them in the following speech:—\r\n\r\n“My lads,—I once more call you together with a sorrowful heart, from what\r\nI have lately seen of the dissatisfaction of the fleets: I call it\r\ndissatisfaction, for the crews have no grievances. To be deserted by my\r\nfleet, in the face of an enemy, is a disgrace which, I believe, never\r\nbefore happened to a British admiral, nor could I have supposed it\r\npossible. My greatest comfort under God is, that I have been supported by\r\nthe officers, seamen, and marines of this ship; for which, with a heart\r\noverflowing with gratitude, I request you to accept my sincere thanks. I\r\nflatter myself much good may result from your example, by bringing these\r\ndeluded people to a sense of their duty, which they owe, not only to their\r\nking and country, but to themselves.\r\n\r\n“The British Navy has ever been the support of that liberty which has been\r\nhanded down to us by our ancestors, and which I think we shall maintain to\r\nthe latest posterity; and that can only be done by unanimity and\r\nobedience. This ship’s company, and others who have distinguished\r\nthemselves by their loyalty and good order, deserve to be, and doubtless\r\nwill be, the favourites of a grateful country. They will also have, from\r\ntheir inward feelings, a comfort which will be lasting, and not like the\r\nbloating and false confidence of those who have swerved from their duty.\r\n\r\n“It has often been my pride with you to look into the Texel, and see a foe\r\nwhich dreaded coming out to meet us; my pride is now humbled indeed! my\r\nfeelings are not easily expressed! Our cup has overflowed and made us\r\nwanton. The all-wise Providence has given us this check as a warning, and\r\nI hope we shall improve by it. On Him then let us trust, where our only\r\nsecurity may be found. I find there are many good men amongst us; for my\r\nown part, I have had full confidence of all in this ship, and once more\r\nbeg to express my approbation of your conduct.\r\n\r\n“May God, who has thus far conducted you, continue so to do; and may the\r\nBritish Navy, the glory and support of our country, be restored to its\r\nwonted splendour, and be not only the bulwark of Britain, but the terror\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n“But this can only be effected by a strict adherence to our duty and\r\nobedience; and let us pray that the Almighty God may keep us in the right\r\nway of thinking.\r\n\r\n“God bless you all!”\r\n\r\nAt an address so unassuming and patriotic, the whole ship’s crew were\r\ndissolved in tears, and one and all declared, with every expression of\r\nwarmth they could use, their determination to stay by the admiral in life\r\nor death. Their example was followed by all the other ships left in the\r\nsquadron, and the brave and excellent old admiral, notwithstanding the\r\ndefection of so many of his ships, repaired to his station, off the coast\r\nof Holland, to watch the movements of the Dutch fleet. Here he employed a\r\ndevice to hide the sparseness of his fleet by employing one of his\r\nfrigates, comparatively close in shore, to make signals constantly to\r\nhimself and to the other vessels in the offing, many of them imaginary,\r\nand give the enemy the impression that a large squadron was outside. He\r\nhad resolved, however, not to refuse battle, if the Dutch fleet should\r\nhave the courage to come out and offer it.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the mutineers. The accession of the new vessels so elated\r\nParker that he gave way to the wildest fits of extravagance. He talked of\r\ntaking the whole fleet to sea, and selling it to our enemies. He tried to\r\nstop the navigation of the Thames, declaring that he would force his way\r\nup to London, and bombard the city if the Government did not accede to his\r\nterms. The alarm at these proceedings became general in the metropolis,\r\nand the funds fell lower than ever known before or since in the financial\r\nhistory of our country. An order was given to take up the buoys marking\r\nthe channel of the Thames, while the forts were heavily armed and\r\ngarrisoned, so that should Parker attempt his vainglorious threat, the\r\nfleet might be destroyed. The Government now acted with more promptness\r\nand decision than they had previously displayed. Lord Spencer, Lord Arden,\r\nand Admiral Young hastened to Sheerness, and held a board, at which Parker\r\nand the other delegates attended, but the conduct of the mutineers was so\r\naudacious that these Lords of the Admiralty returned to town without the\r\nslightest success. The principal article of conflict on the part of the\r\nseamen’s delegates was the unequal distribution of prize-money, for the\r\nomission of which matter in the recent demands, they greatly upbraided\r\ntheir fellow-seamen at Portsmouth. Bills were immediately passed in\r\nParliament inflicting the heaviest penalties on those who aided or\r\nencouraged the mutineers in any way, or even held intercourse with them,\r\nwhich speedily had the effect of damping their ardour, and by the end of\r\nthe first week in June the fire which Parker had fanned into a serious\r\nconflagration, began to die out. The fleets at Portsmouth and Plymouth\r\ndisowned all fellowship with them, and the example of one or two ships,\r\nsuch as the _Clyde_, which from the first had resisted Parker’s influence,\r\ncommenced to be of effect. The ringleader himself, seeing that his\r\ninfluence was waning, and knowing the perilous position in which he had\r\nplaced himself, tried to re-open negotiations with the Admiralty, but his\r\ndemands were too ridiculous to be considered; whereupon he hung Mr. Pitt\r\nand Mr. Dundas in effigy at the yard-arm of the _Sandwich_. It is a\r\ncurious fact, showing that the crews were simply egged on by the\r\nringleaders, and that there was plenty of loyalty at bottom, that on June\r\n4th, the king’s birthday, the whole fleet insisted on firing a royal\r\nsalute, displaying the colours as usual, and hauling down the red flag\r\nduring the ceremony. Mr. Parker, however, insisted that it should fly on\r\nthe flag-ship.\r\n\r\nOn June 10th two of the ships, the _Leopard_ and _Repulse_, hauled down\r\nthe flag of mutiny, and sailed into the Thames; their example was soon\r\nfollowed by others. Parker and his cause were lost.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of June 14th this miserable affair was at an end. The crew\r\nof the _Sandwich_, Parker’s own ship, brought that vessel under the guns\r\nof the fort at Sheerness, and handed him as a prisoner to the authorities.\r\nSixteen days afterwards he was hanged. His wife presented a petition to\r\nthe queen in favour of her wretched husband, and is stated to have offered\r\na thousand guineas if his life could be spared. But he, of all men who\r\nwere ever hanged, deserved his fate, for he had placed the very kingdom\r\nitself in peril. Other executions took place, but very few, considering\r\nthe heinousness of the crime committed. Still, the Government knew that\r\nthe men had been in the larger proportion of cases more sinned against\r\nthan sinning; and when later, Duncan’s victory over the Dutch fleet\r\nprovided an occasion, an amnesty was published, and many who had been\r\nconfined in prison, some of them under sentence of death, were released.\r\n_En passant_, it may be remarked that three marines were shot at Plymouth\r\non July 6th of the same year, for endeavouring to excite a mutiny in the\r\ncorps, while another was sentenced to receive a _thousand_ lashes.\r\n\r\nThe mutinous spirit evinced at Portsmouth, Plymouth, and the Nore spread,\r\neven to foreign stations. Had it not been for Duncan’s manly and sensible\r\nappeal to his crew, where there were some disaffected spirits, our naval\r\nsupremacy might have been seriously compromised as regards the Dutch. On\r\nboard the Mediterranean Fleet, then lying off the coast of Portugal, the\r\nmutineers had for a time their own way. The admiral commanding, Lord St.\r\nVincent, was, however, hardly the man to be daunted by any number of\r\nevil-disposed fellows. He had only just before added to his laurels by\r\nanother victory over the enemies of his country. The ringleaders on board\r\nthe flagship _St. George_ were immediately seized, brought to trial, and\r\nhanged the next day, although it was Sunday, a most unusual time for an\r\nexecution. Still further to increase the force of the example, he departed\r\nfrom the usual custom of drawing men from different ships to assist at the\r\nexecution, and ordered that none but the crew of the _St. George_ itself\r\nshould touch a rope. The brave old admiral, by his energy and promptitude,\r\nsoon quieted every symptom of disaffection.\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: LORD ST. VINCENT.]\r\n\r\nThe last of the mutinies broke out at the Cape of Good Hope, on October\r\n9th of the same year, when a band of mutineers seized the flagship of\r\nAdmiral Pringle, and appointed delegates in the same way as their\r\nshipmates at home, showing plainly how extended was the discontent in the\r\nservice, and how complete was the organisation of the insurgents. Lord\r\nMacartney, who commanded at the Cape, was, however, master of the\r\noccasion. Of the admiral the less said the better, as he showed the white\r\nfeather, and was completely non-plussed. Macartney manned the batteries\r\nwith all the troops available, and ordered red-hot shot to be prepared. He\r\nthen informed the fleet that if the red flag was not at once withdrawn,\r\nand a white one hoisted, he would open fire and blow up every ship the\r\ncrew of which held out. The admiral at the same time informed the\r\ndelegates that all the concessions they required had already been granted\r\nto the fleets at home, and of course to them. In a quarter of an hour the\r\nred flag was hauled down, and a free pardon extended to the bulk of the\r\noffenders. The ringleaders were, however, hanged, and a few others\r\nflogged. The mutinous spirit never re-asserted itself.\r\n\r\nSince that time, thank God! no British fleet has mutinied; and as at the\r\npresent day the sailors of the Royal Navy are better fed, paid, and cared\r\nfor than they ever were before, there is no fear of any recurrence of\r\ndisaffection. One need only look at the Jack Tar of the service, and\r\ncompare him with the appearance of almost any sailor of any merchant\r\nmarine, to be convinced that his grievances to-day are of the lightest\r\norder. The wrongs experienced by sailors in a part of the merchant service\r\nhave been recently remedied in part; but it is satisfactory to be able to\r\nadd that there is every probability of their condition being greatly\r\nimproved in the future. On this point, however, we shall have more to say\r\nin a later chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE HISTORY OF SHIPS AND SHIPPING INTERESTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The First Attempts to Float—Hollowed Logs and Rafts—The Ark and\r\n     its Dimensions—Skin Floats and Basket-boats—Maritime Commerce of\r\n    Antiquity—Phœnician Enterprise—Did they Round the Cape?—The Ships\r\n           of Tyre—Carthage—Hanno’s Voyage to the West Coast of\r\n     Africa—Egyptian Galleys—The Great Ships of the Ptolemies—Hiero’s\r\n         Floating Palace—The Romans—Their Repugnance to Seafaring\r\n     Pursuits—Sea Battles with the Carthaginians—Cicero’s Opinions on\r\n    Commerce—Constantinople and its Commerce—Venice—Britain—The First\r\n         Invasion under Julius Cæsar—Benefits Accruing—The Danish\r\n        Pirates—The London of the Period—The Father of the British\r\n         Navy—Alfred and his Victories—Canute’s Fleet—The Norman\r\n      Invasion—The Crusades—Richard Cœur de Lion’s Fleet—The Cinque\r\n     Ports and their Privileges—Foundation of a Maritime Code—Letters\r\n     of Marque—Opening of the Coal Trade—Chaucer’s Description of the\r\n          Sailors of his Time—A Glorious Period—The Victories at\r\n          Harfleur—Henry V.’s Fleet of 1,500 Vessels—The Channel\r\n     Marauders—The King-Maker Pirate—Sir Andrew Wood’s Victory—Action\r\n          with Scotch Pirates—The _Great Michael_ and the _Great\r\n       Harry_—Queen Elizabeth’s Astuteness—The Nation never so well\r\n     Provided—“The Most Fortunate and Invincible Armada”—Its Size and\r\n            Strength—Elizabeth’s Appeal to the Country—A Noble\r\n           Response—Effingham’s Appointment—The Armada’s First\r\n     Disaster—Refitted, and Resails from Corunna—Chased in the Rear—A\r\n      Series of _Contretemps_—English Volunteer Ships in Numbers—The\r\n    Fire-ships at Calais—The Final Action—Flight of the Armada—Fate of\r\n    Shipwrecked Spanish in Ireland—Total Loss to Spain—Rejoicings and\r\n                        Thanksgivings in England.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will not now be out of place to take a rapid survey of the progress of\r\nnaval architecture, from log and coracle to wooden walls and ironclads,\r\nnoting rapidly the progressive steps which led to the present epoch.\r\n\r\nIt is only from the Scriptures, and from fragmentary allusions in the\r\nwritings of profane historians and poets, that we can derive any knowledge\r\nof the vessels employed by the ancients. Doubtless our first parents\r\nnoticed branches of trees or fragments of wood floating upon the surface\r\nof that “river” which “went out of Eden to water the garden;” and from\r\nthis to the use of logs singly, or combined in rafts, or hollowed into\r\ncanoes, would be an easy transition. The first boat was probably a mere\r\ntoy model; and, likely enough, great was the surprise when it was\r\ndiscovered that its sides, though thin, would support a considerable\r\nweight in the water. The first specimen of naval architecture of which we\r\nhave any description is unquestionably the ark, built by Noah. If the\r\ncubit be taken as eighteen inches, she was 450 feet long, 75 in breadth,\r\nand 45 in depth, whilst her tonnage, according to the present system of\r\nadmeasurement, would be about 15,000 tons. It is more than probable that\r\nthis huge vessel was, after all, little more than a raft, or barge, with a\r\nstupenduous house reared over it, for it was constructed merely for the\r\npurpose of floating, and needed no means of propulsion. She may have been,\r\ncomparatively speaking, slightly built in her lofty upper works, her\r\ncarrying capacity being thereby largely increased. Soon after the Flood,\r\nif not, indeed, before it, other means of flotation must have suggested\r\nthemselves, such as the inflated skins of animals; these may be seen on\r\nthe ancient monuments of Assyria, discovered by Layard, where there are\r\nmany representations of people crossing rivers by this means. Next came\r\nwicker-work baskets of rushes or reeds, smeared with mud or pitch, similar\r\nto the ark in which Moses was found. Mr. Layard found such boats in use on\r\nthe Tigris; they were constructed of twisted reeds made water-tight by\r\nbitumen, and were often large enough for four or five persons. Pliny says,\r\nin his time, “_Even now_ in British waters, vessels of vine-twigs sewn\r\nround with leather are used.” The words in italics might be used were\r\nPliny writing to-day. Basket-work coracles, covered with leather or\r\nprepared flannel, are still found in a few parts of Wales, where they are\r\nused for fording streams, or for fishing. Wooden canoes or boats, whether\r\nhollowed from one log or constructed of many parts, came next. The\r\npaintings and sculptures of Upper and Lower Egypt show regularly formed\r\nboats, made of sawn planks of timber, carrying a number of rowers, and\r\nhaving sails. The Egyptians were averse to seafaring pursuits, having\r\nextensive overland commerce with their neighbours.\r\n\r\nThe Phœnicians were, past all cavil, the most distinguished navigators of\r\nthe ancient world, their capital, Tyre, being for centuries the centre of\r\ncommerce, the “mart of nations.” Strange to say, this country, whose\r\ninhabitants were the rulers of the sea in those times, was a mere strip of\r\nland, whose average breadth never exceeded twelve miles, while its length\r\nwas only 225 miles from Aradus in the north to Joppa in the south. Forced\r\nby the unproductiveness of the territory, and blessed with one or two\r\nexcellent harbours, and an abundant supply of wood from the mountains of\r\nLebanon, the Phœnicians soon possessed a numerous fleet, which not only\r\nmonopolised the trade of the Mediterranean, but navigated Solomon’s fleets\r\nto the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean, establishing colonies wherever they\r\nwent. Herodotus states that a Phœnician fleet, which was fitted out by\r\nNecho, King of Egypt, even circumnavigated Africa, and gives details which\r\nseem to place it within the category of the very greatest voyages.\r\nStarting from the Red Sea, they are stated to have passed Ophir, generally\r\nsupposed to mean part of the east coast of Africa, to have rounded the\r\ncontinent, and, entering the Mediterranean by the Pillars of Hercules, our\r\nold friends the Rocks of Gibraltar and Ceuta, to have reached Egypt in the\r\nthird year of their voyage. Solomon, too, dispatched a fleet of ships from\r\nthe Red Sea to fetch gold from Ophir. Diodorus gives at great length an\r\naccount of the fleet said to be built by this people for the great Queen\r\nSemiramis, with which she invaded India. Semiramis was long believed by\r\nmany to be a mythical personage; but Sir Henry Rawlinson’s interpretations\r\nof the Assyrian inscriptions have placed the existence of this queen\r\nbeyond all doubt. In the Assyrian hall of the British Museum are two\r\nstatues of the god Nebo, each of which bears a cuneiform inscription\r\nsaying that they were made for Queen Semiramis by a sculptor of Nineveh.\r\nThe commerce of Phœnicia must have been at its height when Nebuchadnezzar\r\nmade his attack on Tyre. Ezekiel gives a description of her power about\r\nthe year B.C. 588, when ruin was hovering around her. “Tyre,” says the\r\nprophet, “was a merchant of the people for many isles.” He states that her\r\nship-boards were made of fir-trees of Senir; her masts of cedars from\r\nLebanon; her oars of the oaks of Bashan; and the benches of her galleys of\r\nivory, brought out of the isles of Chittim.\r\n\r\nTo the Tyrians also is due the colonisation of other countries, which,\r\nfollowing the example of the mother-country, soon rivalled her in wealth\r\nand enterprise. The principal of these was Carthage, which in its turn\r\nfounded colonies of her own, one of the first of which was Gades (Cadiz).\r\nFrom that port Hanno made his celebrated voyage to the west coast of\r\nAfrica, starting with sixty ships or galleys, of fifty oars each. He is\r\nsaid to have founded six trading-posts or colonies. About the same time\r\nHamilco went on a voyage of discovery to the north-western shores of\r\nEurope, where, according to a poem of Festus Avienus,(128) he formed\r\nsettlements in Britain and Ireland, and found tin and lead, and people who\r\nused boats of skin or leather. Aristotle tells us that the Carthaginians\r\nwere the first to increase the size of their galleys from three to four\r\nbanks of oars.\r\n\r\nUnder the dynasty of the Ptolemies the maritime commerce of Egypt rapidly\r\nimproved. The first of these kings caused the erection of the celebrated\r\nPharos or lighthouse at Alexandria, in the upper storey of which were\r\nwindows looking seaward, and inside which fires were lighted by night to\r\nguide mariners to the harbour. Upon its front was inscribed, “King Ptolemy\r\nto God the Saviour, for the benefit of sailors.” His successor, Ptolemy\r\nPhiladelphus, attempted to cut a canal a hundred cubits in width between\r\nArsinoe, on the Red Sea, not far from Suez, to the eastern branch of the\r\nNile. Enormous vessels were constructed at this time and during the\r\nsucceeding reigns. Ptolemy, the son of Lagos, is said to have owned five\r\nhundred galleys and two thousand smaller vessels. Lucian speaks of a\r\nvessel that he saw in Egypt that was one hundred and twenty cubits long.\r\nAnother, constructed by Ptolemy Philopator, is described by Calixenus, an\r\nAlexandrian historian, as two hundred and eighty cubits, say 420 feet, in\r\nlength. She is said to have had four rudders, two heads, and two sterns,\r\nand to have been manned by 4,000 sailors (meaning principally oarsmen) and\r\n3,000 fighting-men. Calixenus also describes another built during the\r\ndynasty of the Ptolemies, called the _Thalamegus_, or “carrier of the\r\nbed-chamber.” This leviathan was 300 feet in length, and fitted up with\r\nevery conceivable kind of luxury and magnificence—with colonnades, marble\r\nstaircases, and gardens; from all which it is easy to infer that she was\r\nnot intended for sea-going purposes, but was probably an immense barge,\r\nforming a kind of summer palace, moored on the Nile. Plutarch in speaking\r\nof her says that she was a mere matter of curiosity, for she differed very\r\nlittle from an immovable building, and was calculated mainly for show, as\r\nshe could not be put in motion without great difficulty and danger.\r\n\r\nBut the most prodigious vessel on the records of the ancients was built by\r\norder of Hiero, the second Tyrant of Syracuse, under the superintendence\r\nof Archimedes, about 230 years before Christ, the description of which\r\nwould fill a small volume. Athenæus has left a description of this vast\r\nfloating fabric. There was, he states, as much timber employed in her as\r\nwould have served for the construction of fifty galleys. It had all the\r\nvarieties of apartments and conveniences necessary to a palace—such as\r\nbanqueting-rooms, baths, a library, a temple of Venus, gardens,\r\nfish-ponds, mills, and a spacious gymnasium. The inlaying of the floors of\r\nthe middle apartment represented in various colours the stories of Homer’s\r\n“Iliad;” there were everywhere the most beautiful paintings, and every\r\nembellishment and ornament that art could furnish were bestowed on the\r\nceilings, windows, and every part. The inside of the temple was inlaid\r\nwith cypress-wood, the statues were of ivory, and the floor was studded\r\nwith precious stones. This vessel had twenty benches of oars, and was\r\nencompassed by an iron rampart or battery; it had also eight towers with\r\nwalls and bulwarks, which were furnished with machines of war, one of\r\nwhich was capable of throwing a stone of 300 pounds weight, or a dart of\r\ntwelve cubits long, to the distance of half a mile. To launch her,\r\nArchimedes invented a screw of great power. She had four wooden and eight\r\niron anchors; her mainmast, composed of a single tree, was procured after\r\nmuch trouble from distant inland mountains. Hiero finding that he had no\r\nharbours in Sicily capable of containing her, and learning that there was\r\nfamine in Egypt, sent her loaded with corn to Alexandria. She bore an\r\ninscription of which the following is part:—“Hiero, the son of Hierocles,\r\nthe Dorian, who wields the sceptre of Sicily, sends this vessel bearing in\r\nher the fruits of the earth. Do thou, O Neptune, preserve in safety this\r\nship over the blue waves.”\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: FLEET OF ROMAN GALLEYS.]\r\n\r\nAmong the Grecian states Corinth stood high in naval matters. Her people\r\nwere expert ship-builders, and claimed the invention of the trireme, or\r\ngalley with three tiers of oars. Athens, with its three ports, also\r\ncarried on for a long period a large trade with Egypt, Palestine, and the\r\ncountries bordering the Black Sea. The Romans had little inclination at\r\nfirst for seamanship, but were forced into it by their rivals of Carthage.\r\nIt was as late as B.C. 261 before they determined to build a war-fleet,\r\nand had not a Carthaginian galley, grounded on the coast of Italy, been\r\nseized by them, they would not have understood the proper construction of\r\none. Previously they had nothing much above large boats rudely built of\r\nplanks. The noble Romans affected to despise commerce at this period, and\r\ntrusted to the Greek and other traders to supply their wants. Quintus\r\nClaudius introduced a law, which passed, that no senator or father of one\r\nshould own a vessel of a greater capacity than just sufficient to carry\r\nthe produce of their own lands to market. Hear the enlightened Cicero on\r\nthe subject of commerce. He observes that, “_Trade is mean if it has only\r\na small profit for its object_; but it is otherwise if it has large\r\ndealings, bringing many sorts of merchandise from foreign parts, and\r\ndistributing them to the public without deceit; and if after a reasonable\r\nprofit such merchants are contented with the riches they have acquired,\r\nand purchasing land with them retire into the country, and apply\r\nthemselves to agriculture, I cannot perceive wherein is the dishonour of\r\nthat function.” Mariners were not esteemed by the Romans until after the\r\ngreat battle of Actium, which threw the monopoly of the lucrative Indian\r\ntrade into their hands. Claudius, A.D. 41, deepened the Tiber, and built\r\nthe port of Ostia; and about fifty years later Trajan constructed the\r\nports of Civita Vecchia and Ancona, where commerce flourished. The Roman\r\nfleets were often a source of trouble to them. Carausius, who was really a\r\nDutch soldier of fortune, about the year 280, seized upon the fleet he\r\ncommanded, and crossed from Gessoriacum (Boulogne) to Britain, where he\r\nproclaimed himself emperor. He held the reins of government for seven\r\nyears, and was at length murdered by his lieutenant. He was really the\r\nfirst to create a British manned fleet. In the reign of Diocletian, the\r\nVeneti, on the coast of Gaul, threw off the Roman yoke, and claimed\r\ntribute from all who appeared in their seas. The same emperor founded\r\nConstantinople, erected later, under Constantine, into the seat of\r\ngovernment. This city seemed to be destined by nature as a great\r\ncommercial centre; caravans placed it in direct communication with the\r\nEast, and it was really the entrepôt of the world till its capture by the\r\nVenetians, in 1204. That independent republic had been then in a\r\nflourishing condition for over two hundred years, and for more than as\r\nmany after, its people were the greatest traders of the world. It was at\r\nVenice in 1202 that some of the leading pilgrims assembled to negotiate\r\nfor a fleet to be used in the fourth crusade. The crusaders agreed to pay\r\nthe Venetians before sailing eighty-four thousand marks of silver, and to\r\nshare with them all the booty taken by land or sea. The republic undertook\r\nto supply flat-bottomed vessels enough to convey four thousand five\r\nhundred knights, and twenty thousand soldiers, provisions for nine months,\r\nand a fleet of galleys.\r\n\r\n“Surrounded by the silver streak,” our hardy forefathers often crossed to\r\nIreland and France, prior to the first invasion of Britain by Julius\r\nCæsar, B.C. 55, when he sailed from Boulogne with eighty vessels and 8,000\r\nmen, and with eighteen transports to carry 800 horses for the cavalry. In\r\nthe second invasion he employed a fleet of 600 boats and twenty-five\r\nwar-galleys, having with him five legions of infantry and 2,000 cavalry, a\r\nformidable army for the poor islanders to contend against. But their\r\nintercourse with the Romans speedily brought about commercial relations of\r\nimportance. The pearl fisheries were then most profitable, while the\r\n“native” oyster was greatly esteemed by the Roman epicures, of whom\r\nJuvenal speaks in his fourth satire. He says they\r\n\r\n  “Could at one bite the oyster’s taste decide,\r\n  And say if at Circean rocks, or in\r\n  The Lucrine Lake, or on the coast of Richborough,\r\n  In Britain they were bred.”\r\n\r\nBritish oysters were exported to Rome, as American oysters are now-a-days\r\nto England. Martial also mentions another trade in one of his epigrams,\r\nthat of basket-making—\r\n\r\n  “Work of barbaric art, a basket, I\r\n  From painted Britain came; but the Roman city\r\n  Now calls the painted Briton’s art their own.”\r\n\r\nThe smaller description of boats, other than galleys, employed by the\r\nRomans for transporting their troops and supplies, were the _kiulæ_,\r\ncalled by the Saxons _ceol_ or _ciol_, which name has come down to us in\r\nthe form of _keel_, and is still applied to a description of barge used in\r\nthe north of England. Thus\r\n\r\n  “Weel may the keel row,”\r\n\r\nsays the song, and on the “coaly Tyne,” a small barge carrying twenty-one\r\ntons four hundredweight is said to carry a “keel” of coals. The Romans\r\nmust also have possessed large transport vessels, for within seventy or\r\neighty years after they had gained a secure footing in this country, they\r\nreceived a reinforcement of 5,000 men in seventeen ships, or about 300\r\nmen, besides stores, to each vessel.\r\n\r\nBede places the final departure of the Romans from Britain in A.D. 409, or\r\njust before the siege of Rome by Attila. Our ancestors were now rather\r\nworse off than before, for they were left a prey to the Vikings—those\r\nbold, hardy, unscrupulous Scandinavian seamen of the north, who began to\r\nmake piratical visits for the sake of plunder to the coasts of Scotland\r\nand England. They found their way to the Mediterranean, and were known and\r\nfeared in every port from Iceland to Constantinople. Their galleys were\r\npropelled mainly by means of oars, but they had also small square sails to\r\nget help from a stern wind, and as they often sailed straight across the\r\nstormy northern seas, it is probable that they had made considerable\r\nprogress in the rigging and handling of their ships. A plank-built boat\r\nwas discovered a few years since in Denmark, which the antiquaries assign\r\nto the fifth century. It is a row-boat, measuring seventy-seven feet from\r\nstem to stern, and proportionately broad in the middle. The construction\r\nshows that there was an abundance of material and skilled labour. It is\r\nalike at bow and stern, and the thirty rowlocks are reversible, so as to\r\npermit the boat to be navigated with either end forward. The vessel is\r\nbuilt of heavy planks overlapping each other from the gunwale to the keel,\r\nand cut thick at the point of juncture, so that they may be mortised into\r\nthe cross-beams and gunwale, instead of being merely nailed. Very similar\r\nboats, light, swift, and strong, are still used in the Shetlands and\r\nNorway.\r\n\r\nLittle is known of the state of England from the departure of the Romans\r\nto the eighth century. The doubtful and traditionary landing of Hengist\r\nand Horsa with 1,500 men, “in three long ships,” is hardly worth\r\ndiscussing here. The Venerable Bede, who wrote about A.D. 750, speaks of\r\nLondon as “the mart of many nations, resorting to it by sea and land;” and\r\nhe continues that “King Ethelbert built the church of St. Paul in the city\r\nof London, where he and his successors should have their episcopal see.”\r\nBut the history of this period generally is in a hopeless fog. Still we\r\nknow that London was now a thriving port. Cæsar, in his “Commentaries”\r\ndistinctly states that his reason for attempting the conquest of England\r\nwas on account of the vast supplies which his Gaulish enemies received\r\nfrom us, in the way of trade. The exports were principally cattle, hides,\r\ncorn, dogs, and _slaves_, the latter an important item. Strabo observes\r\nthat “our internal parts at that time were on a level with the African\r\nslave coasts.” “Britons never shall be slaves” could not therefore have\r\nbeen said in those days. London, long prior to the invasion of England by\r\nthe Romans, was an existing city, and vessels paid dues at Billingsgate\r\nlong before the establishment of any custom-house. Pennant tells us, in\r\nhis famous work on London, “As early as 979, all the reign of Ethelred, a\r\nsmall vessel was to pay _ad Bilynggesgate_ one halfpenny as a toll; a\r\ngreater, bearing sails, one penny; a keel or hulk (_ceol vel hulcus_),\r\nfourpence; a ship laden with wood, one piece for toll; and a boat with\r\nfish, one halfpenny; or a larger, one penny. We had even now trade with\r\nFrance for its wines, for mention is made of ships from Rouen, who came\r\nhere and landed them, and freed them from toll—_i.e._, paid their duties.\r\nWhat they amounted to I cannot learn.”\r\n\r\nThe Danes, having once a foot-hold, were never thoroughly expelled till\r\nthe Norman conquest, and as a maritime race excelled all the nations of\r\nthe north of Europe. They had two principal classes of vessels, the\r\n_Drakers_ and _Holkers_, the former named from carrying a dragon on the\r\nbows, and bearing the Danish flag of the raven. The holker was at first a\r\nsmall boat, hollowed out of the trunk of a tree, but the word “hulk,”\r\nevidently derived from it, was used afterwards for vessels of larger\r\ndimensions. They had also another vessel called a _Snekkar_ (serpent),\r\nstrangely so named, for it was rather a short, stumpy kind of boat, not\r\nunlike the Dutch galliots of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\r\nTheir piratical expeditions soon increased, and Wales and the island of\r\nAnglesey were frequently pillaged by them, while in Ireland they possessed\r\nthe ports of Dublin, Waterford, and Cork, a Danish king reigning in the\r\ntwo first cities. But a king was to arise who would change all this—Alfred\r\nthe Great and Good, the “Father of the British Navy.”\r\n\r\nOn the accession of Alfred the Great to the throne, he found England so\r\nover-run by the Danes, that he had, as every school-boy knows, to conceal\r\nhimself with a few faithful followers in the forests. In his retirement he\r\nbusied himself in devising schemes for ridding his country of the pirate\r\nmarauders; and without much deliberation he saw that he must first have a\r\nmaritime force of his own, and meet the enemies of England on the sea,\r\nwhich they considered their own especial element. He set himself busily to\r\nstudy the models of the Danish ships, and, aided by his hardy followers,\r\nstirred up a spirit of maritime ambition, which had not existed to any\r\ngreat extent before. At the end of four years of unremitting labour in the\r\nprosecution of his schemes, he possessed the nucleus of a fleet in six\r\ngalleys, which were double the length of any possessed by his adversaries,\r\nand which carried sixty oars, and possessed ample space for the fighting\r\nmen on board. With this fleet he put to sea, taking the command in person,\r\nand routed a marauding expedition of the Danes, then about to make a\r\ndescent on the coast. The force was larger than his own; but he succeeded\r\nin capturing one and in driving off the rest. In the course of the next\r\nyear or two he captured or sunk eighteen of the enemy’s galleys, and they\r\nfound at last that they could not have it all their own way on the sea.\r\nAbout this time the cares of government occupied necessarily much of his\r\ntime: his astute policy was to win over a number of the more friendly\r\nDanes to his cause, by giving them grants of land, and obliging them in\r\nreturn to assist in driving off aggressors. He was nearly the first native\r\nof England who made any efforts to extend the study of geography.\r\nAccording to the Saxon chronicler, Florence of Worcester, A.D. 897, he\r\nconsulted Ohther, a learned Norwegian, and other authorities, from whom he\r\nobtained much information respecting the northern seas. Ohther had not\r\nonly coasted along the shores of Norway, but had rounded the North Cape—it\r\nwas a feat in those days, gentle reader, but now Cook’s tourists do it—and\r\nhad reached the bay in which Archangel is situated. The ancient geographer\r\ngave Alfred vivid descriptions of the gigantic whales, and of the\r\ninnumerable seals he had observed, not forgetting the terrible mäelstrom,\r\nthe dangers of which he did not under-rate, and which it was generally\r\nbelieved in those days was caused by a horribly vicious old sea-dragon,\r\nwho sucked the vessels under. He compared the natives to the Scythians of\r\nold, and was rather severe on them, as they brewed no ale, the poor\r\ndrinking honey-mead in its stead, and the rich a liquor distilled from\r\ngoats’ milk. Alfred not merely sent vessels to the north on voyages of\r\ndiscovery, but opened communication with the Mediterranean, his galleys\r\npenetrating to the extreme east of the Levant, whereby he was enabled to\r\ncarry on a direct trade with India. William of Malmesbury mentions the\r\nsilks, shawls, incense, spices, and aromatic gums which Alfred received\r\nfrom the Malabar coast in return for presents sent to the Nestorian\r\nChristians. Alfred constantly and steadily encouraged the science of\r\nnavigation, and certainly earned the right of the proud title he has borne\r\nsince of “Father of the British Navy.”\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: APPROACH OF THE DANISH FLEET.]\r\n\r\nTime passes and we come to Canute. On his accession to the throne as the\r\nson of a Danish conqueror, he practically put an end to the incursions and\r\nattacks of the northern pirates. The influence of his name was so great\r\nthat he found it unnecessary to maintain more than forty ships at sea, and\r\nthe number was subsequently reduced. So far from entertaining any fear of\r\nrevolt from the English, or of any raid on his shores, he made frequent\r\nvoyages to the Continent as well as to the north. He once proceeded as far\r\nas Rome, where he met the Emperor Conrad. II., from whom he obtained for\r\nall his subjects, whether merchants or pilgrims, complete exemption from\r\nthe heavy tolls usually exacted on their former visits to that city.\r\nCanute was a cosmopolitan. By his conquest of Norway, not merely did he\r\nrepresent the English whom he had subjugated, and who had become attached\r\nto him, but the Danes, their constant and inveterate foes and rivals. He\r\nthus united under one sovereignty the principal maritime nations of the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nAnd still the writer exerts the privilege conceded to all who wield the\r\npen, of passing quickly over the pages of history. “The stories,” says a\r\nwriter(129) who made maritime subjects a peculiar study, “as to the number\r\nof vessels under the order of the Conqueror on his memorable expedition\r\nare very conflicting. Some writers have asserted that the total number\r\namounted to no less than 3,000, of which six or seven hundred were of a\r\nsuperior order, the remainder consisting of boats temporarily built, and\r\nof the most fragile description. Others place the whole fleet at not more\r\nthan 800 vessels of all sizes, and this number is more likely to be\r\nnearest the truth. There are now no means of ascertaining their size, but\r\ntheir form may be conjectured from the representation of these vessels on\r\nthe rolls of the famous Bayeux tapestry. It is said that when William\r\nmeditated his descent on England he ordered ‘large ships’ to be\r\nconstructed for that purpose at his seaports, collecting, wherever these\r\ncould be found, smaller vessels or boats, to accompany them. But even the\r\nlargest must have been of little value, as the whole fleet were by his\r\norders burned and destroyed, as soon as he landed with his army, so as to\r\ncut off all retreat, and to save the expense of their maintenance.” This\r\nwould indicate that the sailors had to fight ashore, and may possibly have\r\nbeen intended to spur on his army to victory. Freeman states, in his\r\n“History of the Norman Conquest,” that he finds the largest number of\r\nships in the Conqueror’s expedition, as compiled from the most reliable\r\nauthorities, was 3,000, but some accounts put it as low as 693. Most of\r\nthe ships were presents from the prelates or great barons. William\r\nFitzOsborn gave 60, the Count de Mortaine, 120; the Bishop of Bayeux, 100;\r\nand the finest of all, that in which William himself embarked, was\r\npresented to him by his own duchess, Matilda, and named the _Mora_. Norman\r\nwriters of the time state that the vessels were not much to boast of, as\r\nthey were all collected between the beginning of January and the end of\r\nAugust, 1066. Lindsay, who thoroughly investigated the subject, says that\r\n“The Norman merchant vessels or transports were in length about three\r\ntimes their breadth, and were sometimes propelled by oars, but generally\r\nby sails; their galleys appear to have been of two sorts—the larger,\r\noccasionally called galleons, carrying in some instances sixty men, well\r\narmed with iron armour, besides their oars. The smaller galleys, which are\r\nnot specially described, doubtless resembled ships’ launches in size, but\r\nof a form enabling them to be propelled at a considerable rate of speed.”\r\nBoats covered with leather were even employed on the perilous Channel\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: SHIPS OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR. (_From the Bayeux\r\n                               Tapestry._)]\r\n\r\nThe Conqueror soon added to the security of the country by the\r\nestablishment of the Cinque Ports, which, as their title denotes, were at\r\nfirst five, but were afterwards increased in number so as to include the\r\nfollowing seaports:—Dover, Sandwich, Hythe, and Romsey, in Kent; and Rye,\r\nWinchelsea, Hastings, and Seaford, in Sussex. On their first establishment\r\nthey were to provide fifty-two ships, with twenty-four men on each, for\r\nfifteen days each year, in case of emergency. In return they had many\r\nprivileges, a part of which are enjoyed by them to-day. Their freemen were\r\nstyled barons; each of the ports returned two members of Parliament. An\r\nofficer was appointed over them, who was “Lord Warden of the Cinque\r\nPorts,” and also Constable of Dover Castle.\r\n\r\n“For more than a hundred years after the Conquest,” says the writer just\r\nquoted, “England’s ships had rarely ventured beyond the Bay of Biscay on\r\nthe one hand, and the entrance to the Baltic on the other; and there is no\r\nspecial record of long voyages by English ships until the time of the\r\nCrusades; which, whatever they might have done for the cause of the Cross,\r\nundoubtedly gave the first impetus to the shipping of the country. The\r\nnumber of rich and powerful princes and nobles who embarked their fortunes\r\nin these extraordinary expeditions offered the chance of lucrative\r\nemployment to any nation which could supply the requisite amount of\r\ntonnage, and English shipowners very naturally made great exertions to\r\nreap a share of the gains.” One of the first English noblemen who fitted\r\nout an expedition to the Holy Land was the Earl of Essex; and twelve years\r\nafterwards, Richard Cœur de Lion, on ascending the throne, made vast\r\nlevies on the people for the same object, joining Philip II. and other\r\nprinces for the purpose of raising the Cross above the Crescent. Towards\r\nthe close of 1189 two fleets had been collected, one at Dover, to convey\r\nRichard and his followers (among whom were the Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nthe Bishop of Salisbury, and the Lord Chief Justice of England) across the\r\nChannel, and a second and still larger fleet at Dartmouth, composed of\r\nnumbers of vessels from Aquitaine, Brittany, Normandy, and Poitou, for the\r\nconveyance of the great bulk of the Crusaders, to join Richard at\r\nMarseilles, whither he had gone overland with the French king and his\r\nother allies. The Dartmouth fleet, under the command of Richard de\r\nCamville and Robert de Sabloil, set sail about the end of April, 1190. It\r\nhad a disastrous voyage, but at length reached Lisbon, where the Crusaders\r\nbehaved so badly, and committed so many outrages, that 700 were locked up.\r\nAfter some delay, they sailed up the Mediterranean, reaching Marseilles,\r\nwhere they had to stop some time to repair their unseaworthy ships, and\r\nthen followed the king to the Straits of Messina, where the fleets\r\ncombined. It was not till seven months later that the fleet got under\r\nweigh for the Holy Land. It numbered 100 ships of larger kind, and\r\nfourteen smaller vessels called “busses.” Each of the former carried,\r\nbesides her crew of fifteen sailors, forty soldiers, forty horses, and\r\nprovisions for a twelvemonth. Vinisauf, who makes the fleet much larger,\r\nmentions that it proceeded in the following order:—three large ships\r\nformed the van; the second line consisted of thirteen vessels, the lines\r\nexpanding to the seventh, which consisted of sixty vessels, and\r\nimmediately preceded the king and his ships. On their way they fell in\r\nwith a very large ship belonging to the Saracens, manned by 1,500 men, and\r\nafter a desperate engagement took her. Richard ordered that all but 200 of\r\nthose not killed in the action should be thrown overboard, and thus 1,300\r\ninfidels were sacrificed at one blow. Off Etna, Sicily, they experienced a\r\nterrific gale, and the crew got “sea-sick and frightened;” and off the\r\nisland of Cyprus they were assailed by another storm, in which three ships\r\nwere lost, and the Vice-Chancellor of England was drowned, his body being\r\nwashed ashore with the Great Seal of England hanging round his neck.\r\nRichard did not return to England till after the capture of Acre, and the\r\ntruce with Saladin; he landed at Sandwich, as nearly as may be, four years\r\nfrom the date of his start. As this is neither a history of England, nor\r\nof the Crusades, excepting only as either are connected with the sea, we\r\nmust pass on to a subject of some importance, which was the direct result\r\nof experience gained at this period.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: CRUSADERS AND SARACENS.]\r\n\r\nThe foundation of a maritime code, by an ordinance of Richard Cœur de\r\nLion, a most important step in the history of merchant shipping, was due\r\nto the knowledge acquired by English pilgrims, traders, and seamen at the\r\ntime of the Crusades. The first code was founded on a similar set of rules\r\nthen existing in France, known as the _Rôles d’Oleron_, and some of the\r\narticles show how loose had been the conditions of the sailor’s life\r\npreviously. The first article gave a master power to pledge the tackle of\r\na ship, if in want of provisions for the crew, but forbad the sale of the\r\nhull without the owner’s permission. The captain’s position, as lord\r\nparamount on board, was defined; no one, not even part-owners or\r\nsuper-cargoes, must interfere; he was expected to understand thoroughly\r\nthe art of navigation. The second article declared that if a vessel was\r\nheld in port through failure of wind or stress of weather, the ship’s\r\ncompany should be guided as to the best course to adopt by the opinion of\r\nthe majority. Two succeeding articles related to wrecks and salvage. The\r\nfifth article provided that no sailor in port should leave the vessel\r\nwithout the master’s consent; if he did so, and any harm resulted to the\r\nship or cargo, he should be punished with a year’s imprisonment, on bread\r\nand water. He might also be flogged. If he deserted altogether and was\r\nretaken, he might be branded on the face with a red-hot iron, although\r\nallowance was made for such as ran away from their ships through\r\nill-usage. Sailors could also be compensated for unjust discharge without\r\ncause. Succeeding clauses refer to the moral conduct of the sailor,\r\nforbidding drunkenness, fighting, &c. Article 12 provided that if any\r\nmariner should give the lie to another at a table where there was wine and\r\nbread, he should be fined four _deniers_; and the master himself offending\r\nin the same way should be liable to a double fine. If any sailor should\r\nimpudently contradict the mate, he might be fined eight _deniers_; and if\r\nthe master struck him with his fist or open hand he was required to bear\r\nthe stroke, but if struck more than once he was entitled to defend\r\nhimself. If the sailor committed the first assault he was to be fined 100\r\n_sous_, or else his hand was to be chopped off. The master was required by\r\nanother rule not to give his crew cause for mutiny, nor call them names,\r\nnor wrong them, nor “keep anything from them that is theirs, but to use\r\nthem well, and pay them honestly what is their due.” Another clause\r\nprovided that the sailor might always have the option of going on shares\r\nor wages, and the master was to put the matter fairly before them. The\r\n17th clause related to food. The hardy sailors of Brittany were to have\r\nonly one meal a day from the kitchen, while the lucky ones of Normandy\r\nwere to have two. When the ship arrived at a wine country the master was\r\nbound to provide the crew with wine. Sailors were elsewhere forbidden to\r\ntake “royal” fish, such as the sturgeon, salmon, turbot, and sea-barbel,\r\nor to take on their own account fish which yield oil. These are a part\r\nonly of the clauses; many others referring to matters connected with\r\nrigging, masts, anchorages, pilotage, and other technical points. In bad\r\npilotage the navigator who brought mishap on the ship was liable to lose\r\nhis head. The general tenor of the first code is excellent, and the rules\r\nwere laid down with an evident spirit of fairness alike to the owner and\r\nsailor.\r\n\r\nThe subject of “Letters of Marque” might occupy an entire volume, and will\r\nrecur again in these pages; They were in reality nothing more than\r\nprivileges granted for purposes of retaliation-legalised piracy. They were\r\nfirst issued by Edward I., and the very first related to an outrage\r\ncommitted by Portuguese on an English subject. A merchant of Bayonne, at\r\nthe time a port belonging to England, in Gascony, had shipped a cargo of\r\nfruit from Malaga, which, on its voyage along the coast of Portugal, was\r\nseized and carried into Lisbon by an armed cruiser belonging to that\r\ncountry, then at peace with England. The King of Portugal, who had\r\nreceived one-tenth part of the cargo, declined to restore the ship or\r\nlading, whereupon the owner and his heirs received a licence, to remain in\r\nforce five years, to seize the property of the Portuguese, and especially\r\nthat of the inhabitants of Lisbon, to the extent of the loss sustained,\r\nthe expenses of recovery being allowed. How far the merchant of Bayonne\r\nrecouped himself, history sayeth not.\r\n\r\nA little later a most important mercantile trade came into existence—that\r\nin coal. From archæological remains and discoveries it is certain that the\r\nRomans excavated coal during their reign on this island; but it was not\r\ntill the reign of Edward III. that the first opening of the great\r\nNewcastle coal-fields took place, although as early as 1253 there was a\r\nlane at the back of Newgate called “Sea-coal Lane.” As in many other\r\ninstances, even in our own days, the value of the discovery seems to have\r\nbeen more appreciated by foreigners than by the people of this country,\r\nand for a considerable time after it had been found, the combustion of\r\ncoal was considered to be so unhealthy that a royal edict forbad its use\r\nin the city of London, while the queen resided there, in case it might\r\nprove “pernicious to her health.” At the same time, while England laid her\r\nveto on the use of that very article which has since made her, or helped\r\nto make her, the most famous commercial nation of the world, France sent\r\nher ships laden with corn to Newcastle, carrying back coal in return, her\r\nmerchants being the first to supply this new great article of commerce to\r\nforeign countries. In the reign of Henry V. the trade had become of such\r\nimportance that a special Act was passed providing for the admeasurement\r\nof ships and barges employed in the coal trade.\r\n\r\nKing John stoutly claimed for England the sovereignty of the sea—he was\r\nnot always so firm and decided—and decreed that all foreign ships, the\r\nmasters of which should refuse to strike their colours to the British\r\nflag, should be seized and deemed good and lawful prizes. This monarch is\r\nstated to have fitted out no less than 500 ships, under the Earl of\r\nSalisbury, in the year 1213, against a fleet of ships three times that\r\nnumber, organised by Philip of France, for the invasion of England. After\r\na stubborn battle, the English were successful, taking 300 sail, and\r\ndriving more than 100 ashore, Philip being under the necessity of\r\ndestroying the remainder to prevent them falling into the hands of their\r\nenemies. Some notion may be gained of the kinds of ships of which these\r\nfleets were composed, by the account that is narrated of an action fought\r\nin the following reign with the French, who, with eighty “stout ships,”\r\nthreatened the coast of Kent. This fleet being discovered by Hubert de\r\nBurgh, governor of Dover Castle, he put to sea with half the number of\r\nEnglish vessels, and having got to the windward of the enemy, and run down\r\nmany of the smaller ships, he closed with the rest, and threw on board\r\nthem a quantity of quick-lime—a novel expedient in warfare—which so\r\nblinded the crews that their vessels were either captured or sunk. The\r\ndominion of the sea was bravely maintained by our Edwards and Henrys in\r\nmany glorious sea-fights. The temper of the times is strongly exemplified\r\nby the following circumstance. In the reign of Edward I. an English sailor\r\nwas killed in a Norman port, in consequence of which war was declared by\r\nEngland against France, and the two nations agreed to decide the dispute\r\non a certain day, with the whole of their respective naval forces. The\r\nspot of battle was to be the middle of the Channel, marked out by\r\nanchoring there an empty ship. This strange duel of nations actually took\r\nplace, for the two fleets met on April 14th, 1293, when the English\r\nobtained the victory, and carried off in triumph 250 vessels from the\r\nenemy. In an action off the harbour of Sluys with the French fleet, Edward\r\nIII. is said to have slain 30,000 of the enemy, and to have taken 200\r\nlarge ships, “in one of which only, there were 400 dead bodies.” The same\r\nmonarch, at the siege of Calais, is stated to have blockaded that port\r\nwith 730 sail, having on board 14,956 mariners. The size of the vessels\r\nemployed must have been rapidly enlarging.\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: DUEL BETWEEN FRENCH AND ENGLISH SHIPS.]\r\n\r\nChaucer gives us a graphic description of the British sailor of the\r\nfourteenth century in his Prologue to the “Canterbury Tales,” It runs as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n  “A schipman was ther, wonyng fer by Weste:\r\n  For ought I woot, he was of Dertemouthe,\r\n  He rood upon a rouncy, as he couthe,\r\n  In a goun of faldying to the kne.\r\n  A dagger hangyng on a laas hadde he\r\n  Aboute his nekke under his arm adoun.\r\n  The hoote somer had maad his hew al broun;\r\n  And certainly he was a good felawe.\r\n  Ful many a draught of wyn had he drawe\r\n  From Burdeux-ward, whil that the chapman sleep.\r\n  Of nyce conscience took he no keep.\r\n  If that he foughte, and hadde the heigher hand,\r\n  By water he sent hem hoom to every land.\r\n  But of his craft to rikne wel the tydes,\r\n  His stremes and his dangers him bisides,\r\n  His herbergh and his mane his lode menage,\r\n  Ther was non such from Hulle to Cartage.\r\n  Hardy he was, and wys to undertake;\r\n  With many a tempest hadde his berd ben schake.\r\n  He knew well alle the havens, as thei were,\r\n  From Scotland to the Cape of Fynestere,\r\n  And every cryk in Bretayne and in Spayne,\r\n  His barge y-cleped was the _Magdelayne_.”\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Henry V., the most glorious period up to that time of the\r\nBritish Navy, the French lost nearly all their navy to us at various\r\ntimes; among other victories, Henry Page, Admiral of the Cinque Ports,\r\ncaptured 120 merchantmen forming the Rochelle fleet, and all richly laden.\r\nTowards the close of this reign, about the year 1416, England formally\r\nclaimed the dominion of the sea, and a Parliamentary document recorded the\r\nfact. “It was never absolute,” says Sir Walter Raleigh, “until the time of\r\nHenry VIII.” That great voyager and statesman adds that, “Whoever commands\r\nthe sea, commands the trade of the world; whosoever commands the trade,\r\ncommands the riches of the world, and consequently the world itself.”\r\n\r\nA curious poem is included in the first volume of Hakluyt’s famous\r\ncollection of voyages, bearing reference to the navy of Henry. It is\r\nentitled, “The English Policie, exhorting all England to keep the Sea,”\r\n&c. It was written apparently about the year 1435. It is a long poem, and\r\nthe following is an extract merely:—\r\n\r\n  “And if I should conclude all by the King,\r\n  Henrie the Fift, what was his purposing,\r\n  Whan at Hampton he made the great _dromons_,\r\n  Which passed other great ships of the Commons;\r\n  The _Trinitie_, the _Grace de Dieu_, the _Holy Ghost_,\r\n  And other moe, which as nowe be lost.\r\n  What hope ye was the king’s great intente\r\n  Of thoo shippes, and what in mind be meant:\r\n  It is not ellis, but that _he cast to bee_\r\n  Lord round about environ of the see.\r\n  And if he had to this time lived here,\r\n  He had been Prince named withouten pere:\r\n  His great ships should have been put in preefes,\r\n  Unto the ende that he ment of in chiefes.\r\n  For doubt it not but that he would have bee\r\n  Lord and Master about the rand see:\r\n  And kept it sure, to stoppe our ennemies hence,\r\n  And wonne us good, and wisely brought it thence,\r\n  That our passage should be without danger,\r\n  And his license on see to move and sterre.”\r\n\r\nWhen the king had determined, in 1415, to land an army in France, he hired\r\nships from Holland, Zeeland, and Friesland, his own naval means not being\r\nsufficient for the transport; among his other preparations, “requisite for\r\nso high an enterprise,” boats covered with leather, for the passage of\r\nrivers, are mentioned. His fleet consisted of 1,000 sail, and it left\r\nSouthampton on Sunday, the 11th of August, of the above-mentioned year.\r\nWhen the ships had passed the Isle of Wight, “swans were seen swimming in\r\nthe midst of the fleet, which was hailed as a happy auspice.” Henry\r\nanchored on the following Tuesday at the mouth of the Seine, about three\r\nmiles from Harfleur. A council of the captains was summoned, and an order\r\nissued that no one, under pain of death, should land before the king, but\r\nthat all should be in readiness to go ashore the next morning. This was\r\ndone, and the bulk of the army, stated to have comprised 24,000 archers,\r\nand 6,000 men of arms, was landed in small vessels, boats, and skiffs,\r\ntaking up a position on the hill nearest to Harfleur. The moment Henry\r\nlanded he fell on his knees and implored the Divine aid and protection to\r\nlead him on to victory, then conferring knighthood on many of his\r\nfollowers. At the entrance of the port a chain had been stretched between\r\ntwo large, well-armed towers, while it was farther protected by stakes and\r\ntrunks of trees to prevent the vessels from approaching. During the siege,\r\nwhich lasted thirty-six days, the fleet blockaded the port, and at its\r\nconclusion Henry, flushed with a victory, which is said to have cost the\r\nEnglish only 1,600 and the enemy 10,000 lives, determined to march his\r\narmy through France to Calais. It was on this march that he won the\r\nglorious battle of Agincourt. On the 16th of November he embarked for\r\nDover, reaching that port the same day. Here a magnificent ovation awaited\r\nhim. The burgesses rushed into the sea and bore him ashore on their\r\nshoulders; the whole population was intoxicated with delight. One\r\nchronicler states that the passage across had been extremely boisterous,\r\nand that the French noblemen suffered so much from sea-sickness that they\r\nconsidered the trip worse than the very battles themselves in which they\r\nhad been taken prisoners! When Henry arrived near London, a great\r\nconcourse of people met him at Blackheath, and he, “as one remembering\r\nfrom whom all victories are sent,” would not allow his helmet to be\r\ncarried before him, whereon the people might have seen the blows and dents\r\nthat he had received; “neither would he suffer any ditties to be made and\r\nsung by minstrels of his glorious victory, for that he would have the\r\npraise and thanks altogether given to God.”\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: REVERSE OF THE SEAL OF SANDWICH.]\r\n\r\nNext year the French attempted to retake Harfleur. Henry sent a fleet of\r\n400 sail to the rescue, under his brother John, Duke of Bedford, the\r\nupshot being that almost the whole French fleet, to the number of 500\r\nships, hulks, carracks, and small vessels were taken or sunk. The English\r\nvessels remained becalmed in the roadstead for three weeks afterwards.\r\nSouthey, who has collated all the best authorities in his admirable naval\r\nwork,(130) says:—“The bodies which had been thrown overboard in the\r\naction, or sunk in the enemies’ ships, rose and floated about them in\r\ngreat numbers; and the English may have deemed it a relief from the\r\ncontemplation of that ghastly sight, to be kept upon the alert by some\r\ngalleys, which taking advantage of the calm, ventured as near them as they\r\ndare by day and night, and endeavoured to burn the ships with wildfire.”\r\nHe adds that the first mention of wildfire he had found is by Hardyng, one\r\nof the earliest of our poets, in the following passage referring to this\r\nevent:—\r\n\r\n  “With oars many about us did they wind,\r\n  With wildfire oft assayled us day and night,\r\n  To brenne our ships in that they could or might.”\r\n\r\nNext year we read of Henry preparing to again attack France. The enemy had\r\nincreased their naval force by hiring a number of Genoese and other\r\nItalian vessels. The king sent a preliminary force against them under his\r\nkinsman, the Earl of Huntingdon, who, near the mouth of the Seine,\r\nsucceeded in sinking three and capturing three of the great Genoese\r\ncarracks, taking the Admiral Jacques, the Bastard of Bourbon, “and as much\r\nmoney as would have been half a year’s pay for the whole fleet.” These\r\nprizes were brought to Southampton, “from whence the king shortly set\r\nforth with a fleet of 1,500 ships, the sails of his own vessel being of\r\npurple silk, richly embroidered with gold.” The remainder of Henry’s brief\r\nreign—for he died the same year—is but the history of a series of\r\nsuccesses over his enemies.\r\n\r\nIt must never be forgotten that the navies of our early history were not\r\npermanently organised, but drawn from all sources. A noble, a city or\r\nport, voluntarily or otherwise, contributed according to the exigencies of\r\nthe occasion. As we shall see, it is to Henry VIII. that we owe the\r\nestablishment of a Royal Navy as a permanent institution. In 1546 King\r\nHenry’s vessels are classified according to their “quality,” thus:\r\n“ships,” “galleases,” “pynaces,” “roe-barges.” A list bearing date in 1612\r\nexhibits the classes as follows:—“Shipps royal,” measuring downwards from\r\n1,200 to 800 tons; “middling shipps,” from 800 to 600 tons; “small\r\nshipps,” 350 tons; and pinnaces, from 200 to 80 tons. According to the old\r\ndefinition, a ship was defined to be a “large hollow building, made to\r\npass over the seas with sails,” without reference to size or quality.\r\nBefore the days of the _Great Harry_, few, if any, English ships had more\r\nthan one mast or one sail; that ship had three masts, and the _Henri Grace\r\nde Dieu_, which supplanted her, four. The galleas was probably a long,\r\nlow, and sharp-built vessel, propelled by oars as well as by sails; the\r\nlatter probably not fixed to the mast or any standing yard, but hoisted\r\nfrom the deck when required to be used, as in the lugger or felucca of\r\nmodern days. The pinnace was a smaller description of galleas, while the\r\nrow-barge is sufficiently explained by its title.\r\n\r\nThe history of the period following the reign of Henry V. has much to do\r\nwith shipping interests of all kinds. The constant wars and turbulent\r\ntimes gave great opportunity for piracy in the Channel and on the high\r\nseas. Thus we read of Hannequin Leeuw, an outlaw from Ghent, who had so\r\nprospered in piratical enterprises that he got together a squadron of\r\neight or ten vessels, well armed and stored. He not only infested the\r\ncoast of Flanders, and Holland, and the English Channel, but scoured the\r\ncoasts of Spain as far as Gibraltar, making impartial war on any or all\r\nnations, and styling himself the “Friend of God, and the enemy of all\r\nmankind.” This pirate escaped the vengeance of man, but at length was\r\npunished by the elements: the greater part of his people perished in a\r\nstorm, and Hannequin Leeuw disappeared from the scene. Shortly afterwards\r\nwe find the Hollanders and Zeelanders uniting their forces against the\r\nEasterling pirates, then infesting the seas, and taking twenty of their\r\nships. “This action,” says Southey, “was more important in its\r\nconsequences than in itself; it made the two provinces sensible, for the\r\nfirst time, of their maritime strength, and gave a new impulse to that\r\nspirit of maritime adventure which they had recently begun to manifest.”\r\nPreviously a voyage to Spain had been regarded as so perilous, that\r\n“whoever undertook it settled his worldly and his spiritual affairs as if\r\npreparing for death, before he set forth,” while now they opened up a\r\nbrisk trade with that country and Portugal. Till now they had been\r\ncompelled to bear the insults and injuries of the Easterlings without\r\ncombined attempt at defence; now they retaliated, captured one of their\r\nadmirals on the coast of Norway, and hoisted a besom at the mast-head in\r\ntoken that they had swept the seas clean from their pirate enemies.\r\n\r\nAnd now, in turn, some of them became pirates themselves, more\r\nparticularly Hendrick van Borselen, Lord of Veere, who assembled all the\r\noutlaws he could gather, and committed such depredations, that he was\r\nenabled to add greatly to his possessions in Walcheren, by the purchase of\r\nconfiscated estates. He received others as grants from his own duke, who\r\nfeared him, and thought it prudent at any cost to retain, at least in\r\nnominal obedience, one who might render himself so obnoxious an enemy.\r\n“This did not prevent the admiral—for he held that rank under the\r\nduke—from infesting the coast of Flanders, carrying off cattle from\r\nCadsant, and selling them publicly in Zeeland. His excuse was that the\r\nterrible character of his men compelled him to act as he did; and the duke\r\nadmitted the exculpation, being fain to overlook outrages which he could\r\nneither prevent nor punish.” A statute of the reign of Henry VI. sets\r\nforth the robberies committed upon the poor merchants of this realm, not\r\nmerely on the sea, but even in the rivers and ports of Britain, and how\r\nnot merely they lost their goods, but their persons also were taken and\r\nimprisoned. Nor was this all, for “the king’s poor subjects dwelling nigh\r\nthe sea-coasts were taken out of their own houses, with their chattels and\r\nchildren, and carried by the enemies where it pleased them.” In\r\nconsequence, the Commons begged that an armament might be provided and\r\nmaintained on the sea, which was conceded, and for a time piracy on\r\nEnglish subjects was partially quashed.\r\n\r\nMeantime, we had pirates of our own. Warwick, the king-maker, was\r\nunscrupulous in all points, and cared nothing for the lawfulness of the\r\ncaptures which he could make on the high seas. For example, when he left\r\nEngland for the purpose of securing Calais (then belonging to England) and\r\nthe fleet for the House of York, he having fourteen well-appointed\r\nvessels, fell in with a fleet of Spaniards and Genoese. “There was a very\r\nsore and long continued battle fought betwixt them,” lasting almost two\r\ndays. The English lost a hundred men; one account speaks of the Spanish\r\nand Genoese loss at 1,000 men killed, and another of six-and-twenty\r\nvessels sunk or put to flight. It is certain that three of the largest\r\nvessels were taken into Calais, laden with wine, oil, iron, wax, cloth of\r\ngold, and other riches, in all amounting in value to no less than £10,000.\r\nThe earl was a favourite with the sailors, probably for the license he\r\ngave them; when the Duke of Somerset was appointed by the king’s party to\r\nthe command of Calais, from which he was effectually shut out by Warwick,\r\nthey carried off some of his ships and deserted with them to the latter.\r\nNot long after, when reinforcements were lying at Sandwich waiting to\r\ncross the Channel to Somerset’s aid, March and Warwick borrowed £18,000\r\nfrom merchants, and dispatched John Dynham on a piratical expedition. He\r\nlanded at Sandwich, surprised the town, took Lord Rivers and his son in\r\ntheir beds, robbed houses, took the principal ships of the king’s navy,\r\nand carried them off, well furnished as they were with ordnance and\r\nartillery. For a time Warwick carried all before him, but not a few of his\r\nactions were most unmitigated specimens of piracy, on nations little\r\nconcerned with the Houses of York and Lancaster, their quarrels or wars.\r\n\r\nBut as this is not intended to be even a sketch of the history of England,\r\nlet us pass to the commencement of the reign of Henry VII., when the\r\n“great minishment and decay of the navy, and the idleness of the\r\nmariners,” were represented to his first Parliament, and led to certain\r\nenactments in regard to the use of foreign bottoms. The wines of Southern\r\nFrance were forbidden to be imported hither in any but English, Irish, or\r\nWelsh ships, manned by English, Irish, or Welsh sailors. This Act was\r\nrepeated in the fourth year of Henry’s reign, and made to include other\r\narticles, while it was then forbidden to freight an alien ship from or to\r\nEngland with “any manner of merchandise,” if sufficient freight were to be\r\nhad in English vessels, on pain of forfeiture, one-half to the king, the\r\nother to the seizers. “Henry,” says Lord Bacon, “being a king that loved\r\nwealth, and treasure, he could not endure to have trade sick, nor any\r\nobstruction to continue in the gate-vein which disperseth that blood.” How\r\nwell he loved riches is proved by the fact that when a speedy and not\r\naltogether creditable peace was established between England and France,\r\nand the indemnity had been paid by the latter, the money went into the\r\nking’s private coffers; those who had impoverished themselves in his\r\nservice, or had contributed to the general outfit by the forced\r\n“benevolence,” were left out in the cold. From Calais Henry wrote letters\r\nto the Lord Mayor and aldermen (“which was a courtesy,” says Lord Bacon,\r\n“that he sometimes used), half bragging what great sums he had obtained\r\nfor the peace, as knowing well that it was ever good news in London that\r\nthe king’s coffers were full; better news it would have been if their\r\nbenevolence had been but a loan.”\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: SIR ANDREW WOOD’S VICTORY.]\r\n\r\nScotch historians tell us that Sir Andrew Wood, of Largo, Scotland, had\r\nwith his two vessels, the _Flower_ and _Yellow Carvel_, captured five\r\nchosen vessels of the royal navy, which had infested the Firth of Forth,\r\nand had taken many prizes from the Scotch previously, during this reign.\r\nHenry VII. was greatly mortified by this defeat, and offered to put any\r\nmeans at the disposal of the officer who would undertake this service, and\r\ngreat rewards if Wood were brought to him alive or dead. All hesitated,\r\nsuch was the renown of Wood, and his strength in men and artillery, and\r\nmaritime and military skill. At length, Sir Stephen Bull, a man of\r\ndistinguished prowess, offered himself, and three ships were placed under\r\nhis command, with which he sailed for the Forth, and anchored behind the\r\nIsle of May, waiting Wood’s return from a foreign voyage. Some fishermen\r\nwere captured and detained, in order that they should point out Sir\r\nAndrew’s ships when they arrived. “It was early in the morning when the\r\naction began; the Scots, by their skilful manœuvring, obtained the\r\nweather-gage, and the battle continued in sight of innumerable spectators\r\nwho thronged the coast, till darkness suspended it. It was renewed at\r\nday-break; the ships grappled; and both parties were so intent upon the\r\nstruggle, that the tide carried them into the mouth of the Tay, into such\r\nshoal water that the English, seeing no means of extricating themselves,\r\nsurrendered. Sir Andrew brought his prizes to Dundee; the wounded were\r\ncarefully attended there; and James, with royal magnanimity is said to\r\nhave sent both prisoners and ships to Henry, praising the courage which\r\nthey had displayed, and saying that the contest was for honour, not for\r\nbooty.”\r\n\r\nFew naval incidents occurred under the reign of Henry VII., but it\r\nbelongs, nevertheless, to the most important age of maritime discovery.\r\nHenry had really assented to the propositions of Columbus after Portugal\r\nhad refused them; had not the latter’s brother, Bartholomew, been captured\r\nby pirates on his way to England, and detained as a slave at the oar, the\r\nSpaniards would not have had the honour of discovering the New World.\r\nThis, and the grand discoveries of Cabot (directly encouraged by Henry),\r\nwho reached Newfoundland and Florida; the various expeditions down the\r\nAfrican coast instituted by Dom John; the discovery of the Cape and new\r\nroute to India by Diaz and Vasco de Gama; the discovery of the Pacific by\r\nBalboa, and Cape Horn and the Straits by Magellan, will be detailed in\r\nanother section of this work. They belong to this and immediately\r\nsucceeding reigns, and mark the grandest epoch in the history of\r\ngeographical discovery.\r\n\r\n“The use of fire-arms,” says Southey, “without which the conquests of the\r\nSpaniards in the New World must have been impossible, changed the\r\ncharacter of naval war sooner than it did the system of naval tactics,\r\nthough they were employed earlier by land than by sea.” It is doubtful\r\nwhen cannon was first employed at sea; one authority(131) says that it was\r\nby the Venetians against the Genoese, before 1330. Their use necessitated\r\nvery material alterations in the structure of war-ships. The first\r\nport-holes are believed to have been contrived by a ship-builder at Brest,\r\nnamed Descharges, and their introduction took place in 1499. They were\r\n“circular holes, cut through the sides of the vessel, and so small as\r\nscarcely to admit of the guns being traversed in the smallest degree, or\r\nfired otherwise than straightforward.” Hitherto there had been no\r\ndistinctions between the vessels used in commerce and in the king’s\r\nservice; the former being constantly employed for the latter; but now we\r\nfind the addition of another tier, and a general enlargement of the\r\nwar-vessels. Still, when any emergency required, merchant vessels, not\r\nmerely English, but Genoese, Venetian, and from the Hanse Towns, were\r\nconstantly hired for warfare. So during peace the king’s ships were\r\nsometimes employed in trade, or freighted to merchants. Henry was very\r\ndesirous of increasing and maintaining commercial relations with other\r\ncountries. In the commission to one of his ambassadors, he says, “The\r\nearth being the common mother of all mankind, what can be more pleasant or\r\nmore humane than to communicate a portion of all her productions to all\r\nher children by commerce?” Many special commercial treaties were made by\r\nhim, and one concluded with the Archduke Philip after a dispute with him,\r\nwhich had put a stop to the trade with the Low Countries, was called the\r\ngreat commercial treaty (_intercursus magnus_). “It was framed with the\r\ngreatest care to render the intercourse between the two countries\r\npermanent, and profitable to both.”\r\n\r\nThe first incident in the naval history of the next reign, that of Henry\r\nVIII., grew out of an event which had occurred long before. A Portuguese\r\nsquadron had, in the year 1476, seized a Scottish ship, laden with a rich\r\ncargo, and commanded by John Barton. Letters of marque were granted him,\r\nwhich he had not, apparently, used to any great advantage, for they were\r\nrenewed to his three sons thirty years afterwards. The Bartons were not\r\ncontent with repaying themselves for their loss, but found the Portuguese\r\ncaptures so profitable that they became confirmed pirates, “and when they\r\nfelt their own strength, they seem, with little scruple, to have\r\nconsidered ships of any nation as their fair prize.” Complaints were\r\nlodged before Henry, but were almost ignored, “till the Earl of Surrey,\r\nthen Treasurer and Marshal of England, declared at the council board, that\r\nwhile he had an estate that could furnish out a ship, or a son that was\r\ncapable of commanding one, the narrow seas should not be so infested.” Two\r\nships, commanded by his two sons, Sir Thomas and Sir Edward Howard, were\r\nmade ready, with the king’s knowledge and consent. The two brothers put to\r\nsea, but were separated by stress of weather; the same happened to the two\r\npirate ships—the _Lion_, under Sir Andrew Barton’s own command, and the\r\n_Jenny Perwin_, or _Bark of Scotland_. The strength of one of them is thus\r\ndescribed in an old ballad, by a merchant, one of Sir Andrew’s victims,\r\nwho is supposed to relate his tale to Sir Thomas Howard:—\r\n\r\n  “He is brass within, and steel without,\r\n    With beams on his top-castle strong;\r\n  And thirty pieces of ordnance\r\n    He carries on each side along;\r\n  And he hath a pinnace dearly dight,\r\n    St. Andrew’s Cross it is his guide;\r\n  His pinnace beareth nine score men,\r\n    And fifteen cannons on each side.\r\n  * * * * *\r\n  Were ye twenty ships, and he but one,\r\n    I swear by Kirk, and bower and hall,\r\n  He would overcome them every one\r\n    If once his beams they do down fall.”\r\n\r\nBut it was not so to be. Sir Thomas Howard, as he lay in the Downs,\r\ndescried the former making for Scotland, and immediately gave chase, “and\r\nthere was a sore battle. The Englishmen were fierce, and the Scots\r\ndefended themselves manfully, and ever Andrew blew his whistle to\r\nencourage his men. Yet, for all that, Lord Howard and his men, by clean\r\nforce, entered the main deck. There the English entered on all sides, and\r\nthe Scots fought sore on the hatches; but, in conclusion, Andrew was\r\ntaken, being so sore wounded that he died there, and then the remnant of\r\nthe Scots were taken, with their ship.” Meantime Sir Edward Howard had\r\nencountered the other piratical ship, and though the Scots defended\r\nthemselves like “hardy and well-stomached men,” succeeded in boarding it.\r\nThe prizes were taken to Blackwall, and the prisoners, 150 in number,\r\nbeing all left alive, “so bloody had the action been,” were tried at\r\nWhitehall, before the Bishop of Winchester and a council. The bishop\r\nreminded them that “though there was peace between England and Scotland,\r\nthey, contrary to that, as thieves and pirates, had robbed the king’s\r\nsubjects within his streams, wherefore they had deserved to die by the\r\nlaw, and to be hanged at the low-water mark. Then, said the Scots, ‘We\r\nacknowledge our offence, and ask mercy, and not the law,’ and a priest,\r\nwho was also a prisoner, said, ‘My lord, we appeal from the king’s justice\r\nto his mercy.’ Then the bishop asked if he were authorised by them to say\r\nthus, and they all cried, ‘Yea, yea!’ ‘Well, then,’ said the bishop, ‘you\r\nshall find the king’s mercy above his justice; for, where you were dead by\r\nthe law, yet by his mercy he will revive you. You shall depart out of this\r\nrealm within twenty days, on pain of death if ye be found after the\r\ntwentieth day; and pray for the king.’” James subsequently required\r\nrestitution from Henry, who answered “with brotherly salutation” that “it\r\nbecame not a prince to charge his confederate with breach of peace for\r\ndoing justice upon a pirate and thief.” But there is no doubt that it was\r\nregarded as a national affair in Scotland, and helped to precipitate the\r\nwar which speedily ensued.\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: THE DEFEAT OF SIR ANDREW BARTON.]\r\n\r\nSome of the edicts of the period seem strange enough to modern ears. The\r\nScotch Parliament had passed an Act forbidding any ship freighted with\r\nstaple goods to put to sea during the three winter months, under a penalty\r\nof five pounds. In 1493, a generation after the Act was passed, another\r\nprovided that _all_ burghs and towns should provide ships and busses, the\r\nleast to be of twenty tons, fitted according to the means of the said\r\nplaces, provided with mariners, nets, and all necessary gear for taking\r\n“great fish and small.” The officers in every burgh were to make all the\r\n“stark idle men” within their bounds go on board these vessels, and serve\r\nthem there for their wages, or, in case of refusal, banish them from their\r\nburgh. This was done with the idea of training a maritime force, but seems\r\nto have produced little effect. James IV. built a ship, however, which\r\nwas, according to Scottish writers, larger and more powerfully armed than\r\nany then built in England or France. She was called the _Great Michael_,\r\nand “was of so great stature that she wasted all the oak forests of Fife,\r\nFalkland only excepted.” Southey reminds us that the Scots, like the Irish\r\nof the time, were constantly in feud with each other, and consequently\r\ndestroyed their forests, to prevent the danger of ambuscades, and also to\r\ncut off the means of escape. Timber for this ship was brought from Norway,\r\nand though all the shipwrights in Scotland and many others from foreign\r\ncountries were busily employed upon her, she took a year and a day to\r\ncomplete. The vessel is described as twelve score feet in length, and\r\nthirty-six in breadth of beam, within the walls, which were ten feet each\r\nthick, so that no cannon-ball could go through them. She had 300 mariners\r\non board, six score gunners, and 1,000 men-of-war, including officers,\r\n“captains, skippers, and quarter-masters.” Sir Andrew Wood and Robert\r\nBarton were two of the chief officers. “This great ship cumbered Scotland\r\nto get her to sea. From the time that she was afloat, and her masts and\r\nsails complete, with anchors offering thereto, she was counted to the king\r\nto be thirty thousand pounds expense, by her artillery, which was very\r\ncostly.” The _Great Michael_ never did enough to have a single exploit\r\nrecorded, nor was she unfortunate enough to meet a tragic ending.\r\n\r\nIn 1511 war was declared against France, and Henry caused many new ships\r\nto be made, repairing and rigging the old. After an action on the coast of\r\nBrittany, where both claimed the advantage, and where two of the largest\r\nvessels—the _Cordelier_, with 900 Frenchmen, and the _Regent_, with 700\r\nEnglishmen, were burned—nearly all on board perishing, Henry advised “a\r\ngreat ship to be made, such as was never before seen in England,” and\r\nwhich was named the _Henri Grace de Dieu_, or popularly the _Great\r\nHarry_.(132) There are many ancient representations of this vessel, which\r\nis said to have cost £11,000, and to have taken 400 men four whole days to\r\nwork from Erith, where she was built, to Barking Creek. “The masts,” says\r\na well-known authority, “were five in number,” but he goes on clearly to\r\nshow that the fifth was simply the bowsprit; they were in one piece, as\r\nhad been the usual mode in all previous times, although soon to be altered\r\nby the introduction of several joints or top-masts, which could be lowered\r\nin time of need. The rigging was simple to the last degree, but there was\r\na considerable amount of ornamentation on the hull, and small flags were\r\ndisposed almost at random on different parts of the deck and gunwale, and\r\none at the head of each mast. The standard of England was hoisted on the\r\nprincipal mast; enormous pendants, or streamers, were added, though\r\nornaments which must have been often inconvenient. The _Great Harry_ was\r\nof 1,000 tons, and in—so far as the writer can discover—the only skirmish\r\nshe was concerned in the Channel, for it could not be dignified by the\r\nname of an engagement, carried 700 men. She was burned at Woolwich, at the\r\nopening of Mary’s reign, through the carelessness of the sailors.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: OLD DEPTFORD DOCKYARD.]\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Henry VIII. a navy office was first formed, and regular\r\narsenals were established at Portsmouth, Woolwich, and Deptford. The\r\nchange in maritime warfare consequent on the use of gunpowder rendered\r\nships of a new construction necessary, and more was done for the\r\nimprovement of the navy in this reign than in any former one. Italian\r\nshipwrights, then the most expert, were engaged, and at the conclusion of\r\nHenry’s reign the Royal Navy consisted of seventy-one vessels, thirty of\r\nwhich were ships of respectable burden, aggregating 10,550 tons. Five\r\nyears later, it had dwindled to less than one-half. Six years after\r\nHenry’s death, England lost Calais, a fort and town which had cost Edward\r\nIII., in the height of his power, an obstinate siege of eleven months. But\r\non Elizabeth’s accession to the throne, the star of England was once more\r\nin the ascendant.\r\n\r\nElizabeth commenced her reign by providing in all points for war, that she\r\n“might the more quietly enjoy peace.” Arms and weapons were imported from\r\nGermany, at considerable cost, but in such quantities that the land had\r\nnever before been so amply stored with “all kinds of convenient armour and\r\nweapons.” And she, also, was the first to cause the manufacture of\r\ngunpowder in England, that she “might not both pray and pay for it too to\r\nher neighbours.” She allowed the free exportation of herrings and all\r\nother sea-fish in English bottoms, and a partial exemption from\r\nimpressment was granted to all fishermen; while to encourage their work,\r\nWednesday and Saturday were made “fish-days;” this, it was stated, “was\r\nmeant politicly, not for any superstition to be maintained in the choice\r\nof meats.” The navy became her great care, so much that “foreigners named\r\nher the restorer of the glory of shipping, and the Queen of the North\r\nSea.” She raised the pay of sailors. “The wealthier inhabitants of the\r\nsea-coast,” says Camden, “in imitation of their princess, built ships of\r\nwar, striving who should exceed, insomuch that the Queen’s Navy, joined\r\nwith her subjects’ shipping, was, in short time, so puissant that it was\r\nable to bring forth 20,000 fighting men for sea service.”\r\n\r\nThe greatest and most glorious event of her reign was, without cavil, the\r\ndefeat of the Spanish Armada, at one time deemed and called “The\r\nInvincible.” With the political complications which preceded the invasion,\r\nwe have nought to do: it was largely a religious war, inasmuch as Popish\r\nmachinations were at the bottom of all. When the contest became\r\ninevitable, the Spanish Government threw off dissimulation, and showed “a\r\ndisdainful disregard of secrecy as to its intentions, or rather a proud\r\nmanifestation of them, which,” says Southey, “if they had been successful,\r\nmight have been called magnanimous.” Philip had determined on putting\r\nforth his might, and accounts which were ostentatiously published in\r\nadvance termed it “The most fortunate and invincible Armada.” The fleet\r\nconsisted of 130 ships and twenty caravels, having on board nearly 20,000\r\nsoldiers, 8,450 marines, 2,088 galley-slaves, with 2,630 great pieces of\r\nbrass artillery. The names of all the saints appeared in the nomenclature\r\nof the ships, “while,” says Southey, “holier appellations, which ought\r\nnever to be thus applied, were strangely associated with the Great Griffin\r\nand the Sea Dog, the Cat and the White Falcon.” Every noble house in Spain\r\nwas represented, and there were 180 friars and Jesuits, with Cardinal\r\nAllen at their head, a prelate who had not long before published at\r\nAntwerp a gross libel on Elizabeth, calling her “heretic, rebel, and\r\nusurper, an incestuous bastard, the bane of Christendom, and firebrand of\r\nall mischief.” These priests were to bring England back to the true Church\r\nthe moment they landed. The galleons being above sixty in number were,\r\n“exceeding great, fair, and strong, and built high above the water, like\r\ncastles, easy to be fought withal, but not so easy to board as the English\r\nand the Netherland ships; their upper decks were musket-proof, and beneath\r\nthey were four or five feet thick, so that no bullet could pass them.\r\nTheir masts were bound about with oakum, or pieces of fazeled ropes, and\r\narmed against all shot. The galleases were goodly great vessels, furnished\r\nwith chambers, chapels, towers, pulpits, and such-like; they rowed like\r\ngalleys, with exceeding great oars, each having 300 slaves, and were able\r\nto do much harm with their great ordnance.” Most severe discipline was to\r\nbe preserved; blasphemy and oaths were to be punished rigidly; gaming, as\r\nprovocative of these, and quarrelling, were forbidden; no one might wear a\r\ndagger; religious exercises, including the use of a special litany, in\r\nwhich all archangels, angels, and saints, were invoked to assist with\r\ntheir prayers against the English heretics and enemies of the faith, were\r\nenjoined. “No man,” says Southey, “ever set forth upon a bad cause with\r\nbetter will, nor under a stronger delusion of perverted faith.” The\r\ngunners were instructed to have half butts filled with water and vinegar,\r\nwet clothes, old sails, &c., ready to extinguish fire, and what seems\r\nstrange now-a-days, in addition to the regular artillery, every ship was\r\nto carry two boats’-loads of large stones, to throw on the enemy’s decks,\r\nforecastles, &c., during an encounter.\r\n\r\nMeantime Elizabeth and her ministers were fully aware of the danger, and\r\nthe appeals made to the Lords, and through the lord-lieutenants of\r\ncounties were answered nobly. The first to present himself before the\r\nqueen was a Roman Catholic peer, the Viscount Montague, who brought 200\r\nhorsemen led by his own sons, and professed the resolution that “though he\r\nwas very sickly, and in age, to live and die in defence of the queen and\r\nof his country, against all invaders, whether it were Pope, king, or\r\npotentate whatsoever.” The city of London, when 5,000 men and fifteen\r\nships were required, prayed the queen to accept twice the number. “In a\r\nvery short time all her whole realm, and every corner, were furnished with\r\narmed men, on horseback and on foot; and those continually trained,\r\nexercised, and put into bands in warlike manner, as in no age ever was\r\nbefore in this realm. There was no sparing of money to provide horse,\r\narmour, weapons, powder, and all necessaries.” Thousands volunteered their\r\nservices personally without wages; others money for armour and weapons,\r\nand wages for soldiers. The country was never in better condition for\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\nSome urged the queen to place no reliance on maritime defence, but to\r\nreceive the enemy only on shore. Elizabeth thought otherwise, and\r\ndetermined that the enemy should reap no more advantage on the sea than on\r\nland. She gave the command of the whole fleet to Charles Lord Howard of\r\nEffingham; Drake being vice-admiral, and Hawkins and Frobisher—all grand\r\nnames in naval history—being in the western division. Lord Henry Seymour\r\nwas to lie off the coast of Flanders with forty ships, Dutch and English,\r\nand prevent the Prince of Parma from forming a junction with the Armada.\r\nThe whole number of ships collected for the defence of the country was\r\n191, and the number of seamen 17,472. There was one ship in the fleet (the\r\n_Triumph_) of 1,100 tons, one of 1,000, one of 900, and two of 800 tons\r\neach, but the larger part of the vessels were very small, and the\r\naggregate tonnage amounted to only about half that of the Armada. For the\r\nland defence over 100,000 men were called out, regimented, and armed, but\r\nonly half of them were trained. This was exclusive of the Border and\r\nYorkshire forces.\r\n\r\nThe Armada left the Tagus in the latter end of May, 1588, for Corunna,\r\nthere to embark the remainder of the forces and stores. On the 30th of the\r\nsame month, the Lord Admiral and Sir Francis Drake sailed from Plymouth. A\r\nserious storm was encountered, which dismasted some and dispersed others\r\nof the enemy’s fleet, and occasioned the loss of four Portuguese galleys.\r\nOne David Gwynne, a Welshman, who had been a galley-slave for eleven\r\nyears, took the opportunity this storm afforded, and regained his liberty.\r\nHe made himself master of one galley, captured a second, and was joined by\r\na third, in which the wretched slaves were encouraged to rise by his\r\nexample, and successfully carried the three into a French port. After this\r\ndisastrous commencement, the Armada put back to Corunna, and was pursued\r\nthither by Effingham; but as he approached the coast of Spain, the wind\r\nchanged, and as he was afraid the enemy might effect the passage to the\r\nChannel unperceived, he returned to its entrance, whence the ships were\r\nwithdrawn, some to the coast of Ireland, and the larger part to Plymouth,\r\nwhere the men were allowed to come ashore, and the officers made merry\r\nwith revels, dancing, and bowling. The enemy was so long in making an\r\nappearance, that even Elizabeth was persuaded the invasion would not occur\r\nthat year; and with this idea, Secretary Walsingham wrote to the admiral\r\nto send back four of his largest ships. “Happily for England, and most\r\nhonourably for himself, the Lord Effingham, though he had relaxed his\r\nvigilance, saw how perilous it was to act as if all were safe. He humbly\r\nentreated that nothing might be lightly credited in so weighty a matter,\r\nand that he might retain these ships, though it should be at his own cost.\r\nThis was no empty show of disinterested zeal; for if the services of those\r\nships had not been called for, there can be little doubt, that in the\r\nrigid parsimony of Elizabeth’s government, he would have been called upon\r\nto pay the costs.”\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: THE FIRST SHOT AGAINST THE ARMADA.]\r\n\r\nThe Armada, now completely refitted, sailed from Corunna on July 12th, and\r\nwhen off the Lizard were sighted by a pirate, one Thomas Fleming, who\r\nhastened to Plymouth with the news, and not merely obtained pardon for his\r\noffences, but was awarded a pension for life. At that time the wind “blew\r\nstiffly into the harbour,” but all hands were got on board, and the ships\r\nwere warped out, the Lord Admiral encouraging the men, and hauling at the\r\nropes himself. By the following day thirty of the smaller vessels were\r\nout, and next day the Armada was descried “with lofty turrets like\r\ncastles, in front like a half-moon; the wings thereof speading out about\r\nthe length of seven miles, sailing very slowly though with full sails; the\r\nwind,” says Camden, “being as it were weary with wafting them, and the\r\nocean groaning under their weight.” The Spaniards gave up the idea of\r\nattacking Plymouth, and the English let them pass, that they might chase\r\nthem in the rear. Next day the Lord Admiral sent the _Defiance_ pinnace\r\nforward, and opened the attack by discharging her ordnance, and later his\r\nown ship, the _Ark Royal_, “thundered thick and furiously” into the\r\nSpanish vice-admiral’s ship, and soon after, Drake, Hawkins, and\r\nFrobisher, gave the Admiral Recalde a very thorough peppering. That\r\nofficer’s ship was rendered nearly unserviceable, and he was obliged to\r\ncrowd on sail to catch up with the others, who showed little disposition\r\nfor fighting. After a smart action in which he had injured the enemy much,\r\nand suffered little hurt himself, Effingham gave over, because forty of\r\nhis ships had not yet come up from Plymouth. During the night the\r\nSpaniards lost one of their ships, which was set on fire, it was believed,\r\nby a Flemish gunner, whose wife and self had been ill-treated by the\r\nofficer of the troops on board. The fire was quenched, after all her upper\r\nworks had been consumed; but when the Spaniards left the hulk, they\r\nabandoned fifty of their countrymen, “miserably hurt.” This night was\r\nremarkable for a series of disasters and _contretemps_. A galleon, under\r\nthe command of one Valdez, ran foul of another ship, broke her foremast,\r\nand was left behind. Effingham, supposing that the men had been taken out,\r\nwithout tarrying to take possession of the prize, passed on with two other\r\nvessels, that he might not lose sight of the enemy. “He thought that he\r\nwas following Drake’s ship, which ought to have carried the lanthorn that\r\nnight; it proved to be a Spanish light, and in the morning he found\r\nhimself in the midst of the enemy’s fleet;” but he managed to get away\r\nunobserved, or at all events unpursued. Drake, meantime, was mistakably\r\nfollowing in the dark and stormy night a phantom enemy, in the shape of\r\nfive Easterling vessels. Meantime, the English fleet not seeing the\r\nexpected light on Drake’s ship, lay-to during the night. Drake, next\r\nmorning, had the good fortune to fall in with Valdez, who, after a brief\r\nparley, surrendered, and the prize was sent into Plymouth. Drake and his\r\nmen divided 55,000 golden ducats among them, as part of the spoil on\r\nboard. The hulk of the galleon was taken to Weymouth, and although burned\r\nalmost to the water’s edge, the gunpowder in the hold remained intact and\r\nhad not taken fire. The next day there was considerable manœuvring and\r\nskirmishing, but with no very memorable loss on either side. A great\r\nVenetian ship and some smaller ones were taken from the enemy, while on\r\nour side Captain Cook died with honour in the midst of the Spanish ships,\r\nin a little vessel of his own. Both sides were wary; Effingham did not\r\nthink good to grapple with them, because they had an army in the fleet,\r\nwhile he had none; our army awaited their landing. The Spaniards meant as\r\nmuch as possible to avoid fighting, and hold on till they could effect a\r\njunction with the Prince of Parma. Next morning there was little wind, and\r\nonly the four great galleases were engaged, these having the advantage on\r\naccount of their oars, while the English were becalmed; the latter,\r\nhowever, did considerable execution with chain-shot, cutting asunder their\r\ntacklings and cordage. But they were now constrained to send ashore for\r\ngunpowder, with which they were either badly supplied, or had expended too\r\nfreely. Off the Isle of Wight, the English battered the Spanish admiral\r\nwith their great ordnance, and shot away his mainmast; but other ships\r\ncame to his assistance, beat them off, and set upon the English admiral,\r\nwho only escaped by favour of a breeze which sprung up at the right\r\nmoment. Camden relates how the English shot away the lantern from one of\r\nthe Spanish ships, and the beak-head from a second, and that Frobisher\r\nescaped by the skin of his teeth from a situation of great danger. Still\r\nthis was little more than skirmishing. “The Spaniards say that from that\r\ntime they gave over what they call the pursuit of their enemy; and they\r\ndispatched a fresh messenger to the Prince of Parma, urging him to effect\r\nhis junction with them as soon as possible, and withal to send them some\r\ngreat shot, for they had expended theirs with more prodigality than\r\neffect.” On the other hand the English determined to wait till they could\r\nattack the enemy in the Straits of Dover, where they expected to be joined\r\nby the squadrons under Lord Seymour and Sir William Winter. Meantime\r\nEffingham’s forces were being considerably increased by volunteers; “For\r\nthe gentlemen of England hired ships from all parts at their own charge,\r\nand with one accord came flocking thither as to a set field.” Among the\r\nvolunteers were Sir Walter Raleigh, the Earls of Oxford, Northumberland,\r\nand Cumberland. On the evening of the 27th the Spaniards came to anchor\r\noff Calais, and the English ships, now 140 in number, “all of them ships\r\nfit for fight, good sailors, nimble and tight for tacking about which way\r\nthey would, anchored within cannon-shot.” A squadron of about thirty ships\r\nbelonging to the States, acting in conjunction with the Admiral of Zeeland\r\nand his squadron, effectually blockaded Dunkirk, and the poor Prince of\r\nParma, with his pressed men constantly deserting, his flat-bottomed boats\r\nleaky, and his provisions not ready, could do nothing.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish ships were almost invulnerable to the shot and ordnance of the\r\nday, and “their height was such that our bravest seamen were against any\r\nattempt at boarding them.” These facts were well understood by Elizabeth’s\r\nministers, and the Lord Admiral was instructed to convert eight of his\r\nworst vessels into fire-ships. The orders arrived so _à propos_ of the\r\noccasion, and were so swiftly executed, that within thirty hours after the\r\nenemy had cast anchor off Calais, the ships were unloaded and dismantled,\r\nfilled with combustibles and all their ordnance charged, and their sides\r\nbeing smeared with pitch, rosin, and wildfire, were sent, in the dead of\r\nthe night, with wind and tide, against the Spanish fleet. When the\r\nSpaniards saw the whole sea glittering and shining with the reflection of\r\nthe flames, the guns exploding as the fire reached them, and a heavy\r\ncanopy of dense smoke overhead obscuring the heavens, they remembered\r\nthose terrible fire-ships which had been used so effectively in the\r\nScheldt, and the cry resounded through the fleet, “The fire of Antwerp!”\r\nSome of the Spanish captains let their hawsers slip, some cut their\r\ncables, and in terror and confusion put to sea; “happiest they who could\r\nfirst be gone, though few or none could tell which course to take.” In the\r\nmidst of all this fearful excitement one of the largest of the galleases,\r\ncommanded by D. Hugo de Moncada, ran foul of another ship, lost her\r\nrudder, floated about at the mercy of the tide, and at length ran upon\r\nCalais sands. Here she was assailed by the English small craft, who\r\nbattered her with their guns, but dared not attempt boarding till the\r\nadmiral sent a hundred men in his boats, under Sir Amias Preston. The\r\nSpaniards fought bravely, but at length Moncada was shot through the head,\r\nand the galleas was carried by boarding. Most of the Spanish soldiers, 400\r\nin number, jumped overboard and were drowned; the 300 galley-slaves were\r\nfreed from their fetters. The vessel had 50,000 ducats on board, “a\r\nbooty,” says Speed, “well fitting the English soldiers’ affections.” The\r\nEnglish were about to set the galleas on fire, but the governor of Calais\r\nprevented this by firing upon the captors, and the ship became his prize.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: THE FIRE-SHIPS ATTACKING THE ARMADA.]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Medina Sidonia, admiral of the Spanish Armada, had ordered the\r\nwhole fleet to weigh anchor and stand out to sea when he perceived the\r\napproaching fire-ships; his vessels were to return to their former\r\nstations when the danger should be over. When he fired a signal for the\r\nothers to follow his example, few of them heard it, “because they were\r\nscattered all about, and driven by fear, some of them in the wide sea, and\r\ndriven among the shoals of Flanders.” When they had once more congregated,\r\nthey ranged themselves in order off Gravelines, where the final action was\r\nfought. Drake and Fenner were the first to assail them, followed by many\r\nbrave captains, and lastly the admiral came up with Lord Thomas Howard and\r\nLord Sheffield. There were scarcely two or three and twenty among their\r\nships which matched ninety of the Spanish vessels in size, but the smaller\r\nvessels were more easily handled and manœuvred. “Wherefore,” says Hakluyt,\r\n“using their prerogative of nimble steerage, whereby they could turn and\r\nwield themselves with the wind which way they listed, they came oftentimes\r\nvery near upon the Spaniards, and charged them so sore, that now and then\r\nthey were but a pike’s length asunder; and so continually giving them one\r\nbroadside after another, they discharged all their shot, both great and\r\nsmall, upon them, spending a whole day, from morning till night, in that\r\nviolent kind of conflict.” During this action many of the Spanish vessels\r\nwere pierced through and through between wind and water; one was sunk, and\r\nit was learnt that one of her officers, having proposed to strike, was put\r\nto death by another; the brother of the slain man instantly avenged his\r\ndeath, and then the ship went down. Others are believed to have sunk, and\r\nmany were terribly shattered. One, which leaked so fast that fifty men\r\nwere employed at the pumps, tried to run aground on the Flemish coast,\r\nwhere her captain had to strike to a Dutch commander. Our ships at last\r\ndesisted from the contest, from sheer want of ammunition; and the Armada\r\nmade an effort to reach the Straits. Here a great engagement was expected,\r\nbut the fighting was over, and that which the hand of man barely commenced\r\nthe hand of God completed. The Spaniards “were now experimentally\r\nconvinced that the English excelled them in naval strength. Several of\r\ntheir largest ships had been lost, others were greatly damaged; there was\r\nno port to which they could repair; and to force their way through the\r\nvictorious English fleet, then in sight, and amounting to 140 sail, was\r\nplainly and confessedly impossible.” They resolved upon returning to Spain\r\nby a northern route, and “having gotten more sea room for their\r\nhuge-bodied bulks, spread their mainsails, and made away as fast as wind\r\nand water would give them leave.” Effingham, leaving Seymour to blockade\r\nthe Prince of Parma’s force, followed what our chroniclers now termed the\r\nVincible Armada, and pursued them to Scotland, where they did not attempt\r\nto land, but made for Norway, “where the English,” says Drake, “thought it\r\nbest to leave them to those boisterous and uncouth northern seas.”\r\n\r\nMeantime, it was still expected ashore that the Prince of Parma might\r\neffect a landing, and it was at this time that Elizabeth, who declared her\r\nintention to be present wherever the battle might be fought, rode through\r\nthe soldiers’ ranks at Tilbury, and made her now historical speech.\r\n“Incredible it is,” says Camden, “how much she encouraged the hearts of\r\nher captains and soldiers by her presence and her words.” When a false\r\nreport was brought that the prince had landed, the news was immediately\r\npublished throughout the camp, “and assuredly,” says Southey, “if the\r\nenemy had set foot upon our shores they would have sped no better than\r\nthey had done at sea, such was the spirit of the nation.” Some time\r\nelapsed before the fate of the Armada was known. It was affirmed on the\r\nContinent that the greater part of the English fleet had been taken, and a\r\nlarge proportion sunk, the poor remainder having been driven into the\r\nThames “all rent and torn.” It was believed at Rome that Elizabeth was\r\ntaken and England conquered! Meantime, the wretched Armada was being blown\r\nhither and thither by contending winds. The mules and horses had to be\r\nthrown overboard lest the water should fail. When they had reached a\r\nnorthern latitude, some 200 miles from the Scottish isles, the duke\r\nordered them each to take the best course they could for Spain, and he\r\nhimself with some five-and-twenty of his best provided ships reached it in\r\nsafety. The others made for Cape Clear, hoping to water there, but a\r\nterrible storm arose, in which it is believed more than thirty of the\r\nvessels perished off the coast of Ireland. About 200 of the poor Spaniards\r\nwere driven from their hiding-places and beheaded, through the inhumanity\r\nof Sir William Fitzwilliam. “Terrified at this, the other Spaniards, sick\r\nand starved as they were, committed themselves to the sea in their\r\nshattered vessels, and very many of them were swallowed up by the waves.”\r\nTwo of their ships were wrecked on the coasts of Norway. Some few got into\r\nthe English seas; two were taken by cruisers off Rochelle. About 700 men\r\nwere cast ashore in Scotland, were humanely treated, and subsequently\r\nsent, by request of the Prince of Parma, to the Netherlands. Of the whole\r\nArmada only fifty-three vessels returned to Spain; eighty-one were lost.\r\nThe enormous number of 14,000 men, of whom only 2,000 were prisoners, were\r\nmissing. By far the larger proportion were lost by shipwreck.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: QUEEN ELIZABETH ON HER WAY TO ST. PAUL’S.]\r\n\r\n“Philip’s behaviour,” says Southey, “when the whole of this great calamity\r\nwas known, should always be recorded to his honour. He received it as a\r\ndispensation of Providence, and gave, and commanded to be given,\r\nthroughout Spain, thanks to God and the saints that it was no greater.” In\r\nEngland, a solemn thanksgiving was celebrated at St. Paul’s, where the\r\nSpanish ensigns which had been taken were displayed, and the same flags\r\nwere shown on London Bridge the following day, it being Southwark Fair.\r\nMany of the arms and instruments of torture taken are still to be seen in\r\nthe Tower. Another great thanksgiving-day was celebrated on the\r\nanniversary of the queen’s accession, and one of great solemnity, two days\r\nlater, throughout the realm. On the Sunday following, the queen went “as\r\nin public, but Christian triumph,” to St. Paul’s, in a chariot “made in\r\nthe form of a throne with four pillars,” and drawn by four white horses;\r\nalighting from which at the west door, she knelt and “audibly praised God,\r\nacknowledging Him her only Defender, who had thus delivered the land from\r\nthe rage of the enemy.” Her Privy Council, the nobility, the French\r\nambassador, the judges, and the heralds, accompanied her. The streets were\r\nhung with blue cloth and flags, “the several companies, in their liveries,\r\nbeing drawn up both sides of the way, with their banners in becoming and\r\ngallant order.” Thus ended this most serious attempt at the invasion of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n        THE HISTORY OF SHIPS AND SHIPPING INTERESTS (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n        Noble Adventurers—The Earl of Cumberland as a Pirate—Rich\r\n       Prizes—Action with the _Madre de Dios_—Capture of the Great\r\n     Carrack—A Cargo worth £150,000—Burning of the _Cinco Chagas_—But\r\n        Fifteen saved out of Eleven Hundred Souls—The _Scourge of\r\n        Malice_—Establishment of the Slave Trade—Sir John Hawkins’\r\n         Ventures—High-handed Proceedings—The Spaniards forced to\r\n      Purchase—A Fleet of Slavers—Hawkins sanctioned by “Good Queen\r\n        Bess”—Joins in a Negro War—A Disastrous Voyage—Sir Francis\r\n    Drake—His First Loss—The Treasure at Nombre de Dios—Drake’s First\r\n       Sight of the Pacific—Tons of Silver Captured—John Oxenham’s\r\n       Voyage—The First Englishman on the Pacific—His Disasters and\r\n        Death—Drake’s Voyage Round the World—Blood-letting at the\r\n    Equator—Arrival at Port Julian—Trouble with the Natives—Execution\r\n    of a Mutineer—Passage of the Straits of Magellan—Vessels separated\r\n     in a Gale—Loss of the _Marigold_—Tragic Fate of Eight Men—Drake\r\n    Driven to Cape Horn—Proceedings at Valparaiso—Prizes taken—Capture\r\n     of the great Treasure Ship—Drake’s Resolve to change his Course\r\n         Home—Vessel refitted at Nicaragua—Stay in the Bay of San\r\n       Francisco—The Natives worship the English—Grand Reception at\r\n      Ternate—Drake’s Ship nearly wrecked—Return to England—Honours\r\n    accorded Drake—His Character and Influence—Sir Humphrey Gilbert’s\r\n           Disasters and Death—Raleigh’s Virginia Settlements.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spirit of adventure, fostered by the grand discoveries which were\r\nconstantly being made, the rich returns derived from trading expeditions,\r\nand from the pillage of our enemies, was at its zenith in the reign of\r\nQueen Elizabeth. Nor was it confined to mere soldiers of fortune, for we\r\nfind distinguished noblemen of ample fortunes taking to the seas as though\r\ntheir daily bread depended thereupon. Among these naval adventurers “there\r\nwas no one,” says Southey, “who took to the seas so much in the spirit of\r\na northern sea king as the Earl of Cumberland.” He had borne his part in\r\nthe defeat of the Armada, while still a young man, and the queen was so\r\nwell satisfied with him, that she gave him a commission to go the same\r\nyear to the Spanish coast as general, lending him the _Golden Lion_, one\r\nof the ships royal, he victualling and furnishing it at his own expense.\r\nAfter some fighting he took a prize, but soon after had to cut away his\r\nmainmast in a storm, and return to England. “His spirit remaining,\r\nnevertheless, higher than the winds, and more resolutely by storms compact\r\nand united in itself,” we find him shortly afterwards again on the high\r\nseas with the _Victory_, one of the queen’s ships, and three smaller\r\nvessels. The earl was not very scrupulous as regards prize-taking, and\r\ncaptured two French ships, which belonged to the party of the League. A\r\nlittle later he fell in with eleven ships from Hamburg and the Baltic, and\r\nfired on them till the captains came on board and showed their passports;\r\nthese were respected, but not so the property of a Lisbon Jew, which they\r\nconfessed to have on their ships, and which was valued at £4,500. Off the\r\nAzores, he hoisted Spanish colours, and succeeded in robbing some Spanish\r\nvessels. The homeward-bound Portuguese fleet from the East Indies narrowly\r\nescaped him; when near Tercera some English prisoners stole out in a small\r\nboat, having no other yard for their mainsail than two pipe-staves, and\r\ninformed him that the Portuguese ships had left the island a week before.\r\nThis induced him to return to Fayal, and the terror inspired by the\r\nEnglish name in those days is indicated by the fact that the town of about\r\n500 houses was found to be completely empty; the inhabitants had abandoned\r\nit. He set a guard over the churches and monasteries, and then calmly\r\nwaited till a ransom of 2,000 ducats was brought him. He helped himself to\r\nfifty-eight pieces of iron ordnance, and the Governor of Graciosa, to keep\r\non good terms with the earl, sent him sixty butts of wine. While there a\r\nWeymouth privateer came in with a Spanish prize worth £16,000. Next we\r\nfind the earl at St. Mary’s, where he captured a Brazilian sugar ship. In\r\nbringing out their prize they were detained on the harbour bar, exposed to\r\nthe enemy. Eighty of Cumberland’s men were killed, and he himself was\r\nwounded; “his head also was broken with stones, so that the blood covered\r\nhis face,” and both his face and legs were burnt with fire-balls. The\r\nprize, however, was secured and forwarded to England.\r\n\r\nCumberland himself held on his course to Spain, and soon fell in with a\r\nship of 400 tons, from Mexico, laden with hides, cochineal, sugar, and\r\nsilver, “and the captain had with him a venture to the amount of 25,000\r\nducats,” which was taken. They now resolved to return home, but “sea\r\nfortunes are variable, having two inconstant parents, air and water,” and\r\nas one of the adventurers(133) concisely put it, “these summer services\r\nand ships of sugar proved not so sweet and pleasant as the winter was\r\nafterwards sharp and painful.” Lister, the earl’s captain, was sent in the\r\nMexican prize for England, and was wrecked off Cornwall, everything being\r\nlost in her, and all the crew, save five or six men. On the earl’s ship,\r\ncontrary winds and gales delayed them so greatly that their water failed;\r\nthey were reduced to three spoonfuls of vinegar apiece at each meal; this\r\nstate of affairs lasting fourteen days, except what water they could\r\ncollect from rain and hail-storms. “Yet was that rain so intermingled with\r\nthe spray of the foaming sea, in that extreme storm, that it could not be\r\nhealthful: yea, some in their extremity of thirst drank themselves to\r\ndeath with their cans of salt water in their hands.” Some ten or twelve\r\nperished on each of as many consecutive nights, and the storm was at one\r\ntime so violent that the ship was almost torn to pieces; “his lordship’s\r\ncabin, the dining-room, and the half deck became all one,” and he was\r\nobliged to seek a lodging in the hold. The earl, however, constantly\r\nencouraged the men, and the small stock of provisions was distributed with\r\nthe greatest equality; so at last they reached a haven on the west coast\r\nof Ireland, where their sufferings ended. On this voyage they had taken\r\nthirteen prizes. The Mexican prize which had been wrecked would have added\r\n£100,000 to the profits of the venture, but even with this great\r\ndeduction, the earl had been doubly repaid for his outlay.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: THE EARL OF CUMBERLAND AND THE “MADRE DE DIOS.”]\r\n\r\nThe earl’s third expedition was a failure, but the fourth resulted in the\r\ncapture of the _Madre de Dios_, one of the largest carracks belonging to\r\nthe Portuguese crown. In this, however, some of Raleigh’s and Hawkins’\r\nships had a share. Captain Thomson, who came up with her first, “again and\r\nagain delivered his peals as fast as he could fire and fall astern to load\r\nagain, thus hindering her way, though somewhat to his own cost, till the\r\nothers could come up.” Several others worried the carrack, until the\r\nearl’s ships came up about eleven at night. Captain Norton had no\r\nintention of boarding the enemy till daylight, if there had not been a cry\r\nfrom one of the ships royal, then in danger, “An you be men, save the\r\nqueen’s ship!” Upon this the carrack was boarded on both sides. A\r\ndesperate struggle ensued, and it took an hour and a half before the\r\nattacking parties succeeded in getting possession of the high forecastle,\r\n“so brave a booty making the men fight like dragons.” The ship won, the\r\nboarders turned to pillage, and while searching about with candles,\r\nmanaged to set fire to a cabin containing some hundreds of cartridges,\r\nvery nearly blowing up the ship. The hotness of the action was evidenced\r\nby the number of dead and dying who strewed the carrack’s decks,\r\n“especially,” says the chronicler, “about the helm; for the greatness of\r\nthe steerage requiring the labour of twelve or fourteen men at once, and\r\nsome of our ships beating her in at the stern with their ordnance,\r\noftentimes with one shot slew four or five labouring on either side of the\r\nhelm; whose room being still furnished with fresh supplies, and our\r\nartillery still playing upon them with continual volleys, it could not be\r\nbut that much blood should be shed in that place.” For the times, the\r\nprisoners were treated with great humanity, and surgeons were sent on\r\nboard to dress their wounds. The captain, Don Fernando de Mendoza, was “a\r\ngentleman of noble birth, well stricken in years, well spoken, of comely\r\npersonage, of good stature, but of hard fortune. Twice he had been taken\r\nprisoner by the Moors and ransomed by the king; and he had been wrecked on\r\nthe coast of Sofala, in a carrack which he commanded, and having escaped\r\nthe sea danger, fell into the hands of infidels ashore, who kept him under\r\nlong and grievous servitude.” The prisoners were allowed to carry off\r\ntheir own valuables, put on board one of Cumberland’s ships, and sent to\r\ntheir own country. Unfortunately for them, they again fell in with other\r\nEnglish cruisers, who robbed them without mercy, taking from them 900\r\ndiamonds and other valuable things. About 800 negroes on board were landed\r\non the island of Corvo. Her cargo consisted of jewels, spices, drugs,\r\nsilks, calicoes, carpets, canopies, ivory, porcelain, and innumerable\r\ncuriosities; it was estimated to amount to £150,000 in value, and there\r\nwas considerable haggling over its division, and no little embezzlement;\r\nthe queen had a large share of it, and Cumberland netted £36,000. The\r\ncarrack created great astonishment at Dartmouth by her dimensions, which\r\nfor those days were enormous. She was of about 1,600 tons burden, and 165\r\nfeet long; she was of “seven several stories, one main orlop, three close\r\ndecks, one forecastle (of great height) and a spar deck of two floors\r\napiece.” Her mainmast was 125 feet in height, and her main-yard 105 feet\r\nlong. “Being so huge and unwieldly a ship,” says Purchas, “she was never\r\nremoved from Dartmouth, but there laid up her bones.”\r\n\r\nIn 1594 the earl set forth on his eighth voyage, with three ships, a\r\ncaravel, and a pinnace, furnished at his own expense, with the help of\r\nsome adventurers. Early in the voyage they descried a great Indian ship,\r\nwhose burden they estimated at 2,000 tons. Her name was the _Cinco Chagas_\r\n(the Five Wounds), and her fate was as tragical as her name. She had on\r\nboard a number of persons who had been shipwrecked in three vessels,\r\nwhich, like herself, had been returning from the Indies. When she left\r\nMozambique for Europe, she had on board 1,400 persons, an enormous number\r\nfor those days; on the voyage she had encountered terrible gales, and\r\nafter putting in at Loanda for water and supplies, and shipping many\r\nslaves, a fatal pestilence known by the name of the “mal de Loanda,”\r\ncarried off about half the crew. The captain wished to avoid the Azores,\r\nbut a mutiny had arisen among the soldiers on board, and he was forced to\r\nstand by them, and by this means came into contact with the Earl of\r\nCumberland’s squadron off Fayal. The Portuguese had pledged themselves to\r\nthe ship at all hazards, and to perish with her in the sea, or in the\r\nflames, rather than yield so rich a prize to the heretics. Cumberland’s\r\nships, after harassing the carrack on all sides, ranged up against her;\r\ntwice was she boarded, and twice were the assailants driven out. A third\r\ntime the privateers boarded her, one of them bearing a white flag; he was\r\nthe first of the party killed, and when a second hoisted another flag at\r\nthe poop it was immediately thrown overboard. The English suffered\r\nconsiderably, more especially among the officers. Cumberland’s\r\nvice-admiral, Antony, was killed; Downton, the rear-admiral, crippled for\r\nlife; and Cave, who commanded the earl’s ship, mortally wounded. The\r\nprivateers seem, in the heat of action, almost to have forgotten the\r\nvaluable cargo on board, and to have aimed only at destroying her. “After\r\nmany bickerings,” says the chronicler, “fireworks flew about\r\ninterchangeably; at last the vice-admiral, with a culverin shot at hand,\r\nfired the carrack in her stern, and the rear-admiral her forecastle,\r\n* * * * then flying and maintaining their fires so well with their small\r\nshot that many which came to quench them were slain.” The fire made rapid\r\nheadway, and P. Frey Antonio, a Franciscan, was seen with a crucifix in\r\nhis hand, encouraging the poor sailors to commit themselves to the waves\r\nand to God’s mercy, rather than perish in the flames. A large number threw\r\nthemselves overboard, clinging to such things as were cast into the sea.\r\nIt is said that the English boats, with one honourable exception, made no\r\nefforts to save any of them; it is even stated that they butchered many in\r\nthe water. According to the English account there were more than 1,100 on\r\nboard the carrack, when she left Loanda, of whom only fifteen were saved!\r\nTwo ladies of high rank, mother and daughter—the latter of whom was going\r\nhome to Spain to take possession of some entailed property—when they saw\r\nthere was no help to be expected from the privateers, fastened themselves\r\ntogether with a cord, and committed themselves to the waves; their bodies\r\nwere afterwards cast ashore on Fayal, still united, though in the bonds of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe earl afterwards built the _Scourge of Malice_, a ship of 800 tons, and\r\nthe largest yet constructed by an English subject, and in 1597 obtained\r\nletters patent authorising him to levy sea and land forces. Without royal\r\nassistance, he gathered eighteen sail. This expedition, although it\r\nworried and impoverished the Spaniards, was not particularly profitable to\r\nthe earl. He took Puerto Rico, and then abandoned it, and did not, as he\r\nexpected, intercept either the outward-bound East Indiamen, who, indeed,\r\nwere too frightened to venture out of the Tagus that year, or the\r\nhomeward-bound Mexican fleet. This was Cumberland’s last expedition, and\r\nno other subject ever undertook so many at his own cost.\r\n\r\nThe Elizabethan age was otherwise so glorious that it is painful to have\r\nto record the establishment of the slave-trade—a serious blot on the\r\nreign—one which no Englishman of to-day would defend, but which was then\r\nlooked upon as perfectly legitimate. John Hawkins (afterwards Sir John)\r\nwas born at Plymouth, and his father had long been a well-esteemed\r\nsea-captain, the first Englishman, it is believed, who ever traded to the\r\nBrazils. The young man had gained much renown by trips to Spain, Portugal,\r\nand the Canaries, and having “grown in love and favour” with the\r\nCanarians, by good and upright dealing, began to think of more extended\r\nenterprises. Learning that “negroes were very good merchandise in\r\nHispaniola, and that store of them might easily be had upon the coast of\r\nGuinea,” he communicated with several London ship-owners, who liked his\r\nschemes, and provided him in large part with the necessary outfit. Three\r\nsmall vessels were provided—the _Solomon_, of 120 tons, the _Swallow_, of\r\n100, and the _Jonas_, of forty. Hawkins left England in October, 1562, and\r\nproceeding to Sierra Leone, “got into his possession, partly by the sword\r\nand partly by other means, to the number of 300 negroes at the least,\r\nbesides other merchandise which that country yieldeth.” At the port of\r\nIsabella, Puerto de Plata, and Monte Christo, he made sale of the slaves\r\nto the Spaniards, trusting them “no farther than by his own strength he\r\nwas able to master them.” He received in exchange, pearls, ginger, sugar,\r\nand hides enough, not merely to freight his own vessels, but two other\r\nhulks, and thus “with prosperous success, and much gain to himself and the\r\naforesaid adventurers, he came home, and arrived in September, 1563.”\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: SIR JOHN HAWKINS.]\r\n\r\nThe second expedition was on a larger scale, and included a queen’s ship\r\nof 700 tons. Hawkins arriving off the Rio Grande, could not enter it for\r\nwant of a pilot, but he proceeded to Sambula, one of the islands near its\r\nmouth, where he “went every day on shore to take the inhabitants, with\r\nburning and spoiling their towns,” and got a number of slaves. Flushed\r\nwith easy success, Hawkins was persuaded by some Portuguese to attack a\r\nnegro town called Bymeba, where he was informed there was much gold. Forty\r\nof his men were landed, and they dispersing, to secure what booty they\r\ncould for themselves, became an easy prey to the negroes, who killed\r\nseven, including one of the captains, and wounded twenty-seven. After a\r\nvisit to Sierra Leone, which he left quickly on account of the illness and\r\ndeath of some of his men, he proceeded to the West Indies, where he\r\ncarried matters with a high hand at the small Spanish settlements, at\r\nwhich very generally the poor inhabitants had been forbidden to trade with\r\nhim by the viceroy, then stationed at St. Domingo. To this he replied at\r\nBorburata, that he was in need of refreshment and money also, “without\r\nwhich he could not depart. Their princes were in amity one with another;\r\nthe English had free traffic in Spain and Flanders; and he knew no reason\r\nwhy they should not have the like in the King of Spain’s dominions. Upon\r\nthis the Spaniards said they would send to their governor, who was\r\nthree-score leagues off; ten days must elapse before his determination\r\ncould arrive; meantime he might bring his ships into the harbour, and they\r\nwould supply him with any victuals he might require.” The ships sailed in\r\nand were supplied, but Hawkins, “advising himself that to remain there ten\r\ndays idle, spending victuals and men’s wages, and perhaps, in the end,\r\nreceive no good answer from the governor, it were mere folly,” requested\r\nlicence to sell certain lean and sick negroes, for whom he had little or\r\nno food, but who would recover with proper treatment ashore. This request,\r\nhe said, he was forced to make, as he had not otherwise wherewith to pay\r\nfor necessaries supplied to him. He received a licence to sell thirty\r\nslaves, but now few showed a disposition to buy, and where they did, came\r\nto haggle and cheapen. Hawkins made a feint to go, when the Spaniards\r\nbought some of his poorer negroes, “but when the purchasers paid the duty\r\nand required the customary receipt, the officer refused to give it, and\r\ninstead of carrying the money to the king’s account, distributed it to the\r\npoor ‘for the love of God.’” The purchasers feared that they might have to\r\npay the duty a second time, and the trade was suspended till the governor\r\narrived, on the fourteenth day. To him Hawkins told a long-winded story,\r\nconcluding by saying that, “it would be taken well at the governor’s hand\r\nif he granted a licence in this case, seeing that there was a great amity\r\nbetween their princes, and that the thing pertained to our queen’s\r\nhighness.” The petition was taken under consideration in council, and at\r\nlast granted. The licence of thirty ducats demanded for each slave sold\r\ndid not, however, meet Hawkins’ views, and he therefore landed 100 men\r\nwell armed, and marched toward the town. The poor townspeople sent out\r\nmessengers to know his demands, and he requested that the duty should be\r\n7½ per cent., and mildly threatened that if they would not accede to this\r\n“he would displease them.” Everything was conceded, and Hawkins obtained\r\nthe prices he wanted. Fancy a modern merchant standing with an armed\r\nguard, pistol in hand, over his customers, insisting that he would sell\r\nwhat he liked and at his own price!\r\n\r\nBut all this is nothing to what happened at Rio de la Hacha. There he\r\nspoke of his quiet traffic (!) at Borburata, and requested permission to\r\ntrade there in the same manner. He was told that the viceroy had forbidden\r\nit, whereupon he threatened them that he must either have the licence or\r\nthey “stand to their own defence.” The licence was granted, but they\r\noffered half the prices which he had obtained at Borburata, whereupon he\r\ntold them, insultingly, that “seeing they had sent him this to his supper,\r\nhe would in the morning bring them as good a breakfast.”(134) Accordingly,\r\nearly next day he fired off a culverin, and prepared to land with 100 men,\r\n“having light ordnance in his great boat, and in the other boats double\r\nbases in their noses.” The townsmen marched out in battle array, but when\r\nthe guns were fired fell flat on their faces, and soon dispersed. Still,\r\nabout thirty horsemen made a show of resistance, their white leather\r\ntargets in one hand and their javelins in the other, but as soon as\r\nHawkins marched towards them they sent a flag of truce, and the treasurer,\r\n“in a cautious interview with this ugly merchant,” granted all he asked,\r\nand the trade proceeded. They parted with a show of friendship, and\r\nsaluted each other with their guns, the townspeople “glad to be sped of\r\nsuch traders.”\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: ON THE COAST OF CORNWALL.]\r\n\r\nOn the return voyage, contrary winds prevailed, “till victuals scanted, so\r\nthat they were in despair of ever reaching home, had not God provided for\r\nthem better than their deserving.” They arrived at Padstow, in Cornwall,\r\n“with the loss,” says the narrative printed in Hakluyt’s collection, “of\r\ntwenty persons in all the voyage, and with great profit to the venturers,\r\nas also to the whole realm, in bringing home both gold, silver, pearls,\r\nand other jewels in great store. His name, therefore, be praised for\r\nevermore. Amen!” They did not consider that they had been engaged in a\r\nmost iniquitous traffic, nor was it, indeed, the opinion of the times.\r\n“Hawkins,” says Southey, “then, is not individually to be condemned, if he\r\nlooked upon dealing in negroes to be as lawful as any other trade, and\r\nthought that force or artifice might be employed for taking them with as\r\nlittle compunction as in hunting, fishing, or fowling.” He had a coat of\r\narms and crest bestowed upon him and his posterity. Among other devices it\r\nbore “a demi-Moor, in his proper colour, bound and captive, with annulets\r\non his arms,” &c.\r\n\r\nOn his next expedition for slaving purposes he had six vessels.\r\nHerrera(135) says that two Portuguese had offered to conduct this fleet to\r\na place where they might load their vessels with gold and other riches,\r\nand that the queen had been so taken with the idea that she had supplied\r\nHawkins with two ships, he and his brother fitting out four others and a\r\npinnace. The force on board amounted to 1,500 soldiers and sailors, who\r\nwere to receive a third of the profits. When the expedition was ready, the\r\nPortuguese deserted from Plymouth, and went to France, but as the cost of\r\nthe outfit had been incurred, it was thought proper to proceed. Hawkins\r\nobtained, after a great deal of trouble, less than 150 slaves between the\r\nRio Grande and Sierra Leone. At this juncture a negro king, just going to\r\nwar with a neighbouring tribe, sent to the commander asking his aid,\r\npromising him all the prisoners who should be taken. This was a tempting\r\nbait, and 120 men were sent to assist the coloured warrior. They assaulted\r\na town containing 8,000 inhabitants, strongly paled and well defended, and\r\nthe English losing six men, and having a fourth of their number wounded,\r\nsent for more help; “whereupon,” says Hawkins, “considering that the good\r\nsuccess of this enterprise might highly further the commodity of our\r\nvoyage, I went myself; and with the help of the king of our side,\r\nassaulted the town both by land and sea, and very hardly, with fire (their\r\nhouses being covered with dry palm-leaves), obtained the town, and put the\r\ninhabitants to flight, where we took 250 persons, men, women, and\r\nchildren. And by our friend, the king of our side, there were taken 600\r\nprisoners, whereof we hoped to have had our choice; but the negro (in\r\nwhich nation is seldom or never found truth) meant nothing less, for that\r\nnight he removed his camp and prisoners, so that we were fain to content\r\nus with those few that we had gotten ourselves.” They had obtained between\r\n400 and 500, a part of which were speedily sold as soon as he reached the\r\nWest Indies. At Rio de la Hacha, “from whence came all the pearls,” the\r\ntreasurer would by no means allow them to trade, or even to water the\r\nships, and had fortified the town with additional bulwarks, well manned by\r\nharquebusiers. Hawkins again enforced trade, by landing 200 men, who\r\nstormed their fortifications, at which the Spaniards fled. “Thus having\r\nthe town,” says Hawkins, “with some circumstance, as partly by the\r\nSpaniards’ desire of negroes, and partly by friendship of the treasurer,\r\nwe obtained a secret trade, whereupon the Spaniards resorted to us by\r\nnight, and bought of us to the number of 200 negroes.”\r\n\r\nThis voyage ended most disastrously. Passing by the west end of Cuba, they\r\nencountered a terrific storm, which lasted four days, and they had to cut\r\ndown all the “higher buildings” of the _Jesus_, their largest ship; her\r\nrudder, too, was nearly disabled, and she leaked badly. They made for the\r\ncoast of Florida, but could find no suitable haven. “Thus, being in great\r\ndespair, and taken with a new storm, which continued other three days,”\r\nHawkins made for St. Juan de Ulloa, a port of the city of Mexico. They\r\ntook on their way three ships, having on board 100 passengers, and soon\r\nreached the harbour. The Spaniards mistook them for a fleet from Spain,\r\nwhich was expected about that time, and the chief officers came aboard to\r\nreceive the despatches. “Being deceived of their expectation,” they were\r\nsomewhat alarmed, but finding that Hawkins wanted nothing but provisions,\r\n“were recomforted.” “I found in the same port,” says Hawkins, “twelve\r\nships, which had in them, by report, £200,000 in gold and silver; _all of\r\nwhich being in my possession_, with the king’s island, as also the\r\npassengers before in my way thitherward stayed, I set at liberty, without\r\nthe taking from them the weight of a groat.” This savours rather of\r\nimpudent presumption, for he was certainly not in good condition to fight\r\nat that period. Next day the Spanish fleet arrived outside, when Hawkins\r\nagain rode the high horse, by giving notice to the general that he would\r\nnot suffer them to enter the port until conditions had been made for their\r\nsafe-being, and for the maintenance of peace. The fleet had on board a new\r\nviceroy, who answered amicably, and desired him to propose his conditions.\r\nHawkins required not merely victuals and trade, and hostages to be given\r\non both sides, but that the island should be in his possession during his\r\nstay, with such ordnance as was planted there, and that no Spaniard might\r\nland on the island with any kind of weapon. These terms the viceroy\r\n“somewhat disliked” at first, nor is it very surprising that he did; but\r\nat length he pretended to consent, and the Spanish ships entered the port.\r\nIn a few days it became evident that treachery was intended, as men and\r\nweapons in quantities were being transferred from and to the Spanish\r\nships, and new ordnance landed on the island. Hawkins sent to inquire what\r\nwas meant, and was answered with fair words; still unsatisfied, he sent\r\nthe master of the _Jesus_, who spoke Spanish, to the viceroy, and\r\n“required to be satisfied if any such thing were or not.” The viceroy, now\r\nseeing that the treason must be discovered, retained the master, blew his\r\ntrumpet, and it became evident that a general attack was intended. A\r\nnumber of the English crews ashore were immediately massacred. They\r\nattempted to board the _Minion_ and _Jesus_, but were kept out, with great\r\nloss on both sides. “Now,” says Hawkins, “when the _Jesus_ and the\r\n_Minion_ were gotten about two ships’ lengths from the Spanish fleet, the\r\nfight began so hot on all sides, that, within one hour, the admiral of the\r\nSpaniards was supposed to be sunk, their vice-admiral burnt, and one other\r\nof their principal ships supposed to be sunk. The Spaniards used their\r\nshore artillery to such effect that it cut all the masts and yards of the\r\n_Jesus_, and sunk Hawkins’ smaller ships, the _Judith_ only excepted.” It\r\nhad been determined, as there was little hope to get the _Jesus_ away,\r\nthat she should be placed as a target or defence for the _Minion_ till\r\nnight, when they would remove such of the stores and valuables as was\r\npossible, and then abandon her. “As we were thus determining,” says\r\nHawkins, “and had placed the _Minion_ from the shot of the land, suddenly\r\nthe Spaniards fired two great ships which were coming directly with us;\r\nand having no means to avoid the fire, it bred among the men a marvellous\r\nfear, so that some said, ‘Let us depart with the _Minion_;’ others said,\r\n‘Let us see whether the wind will carry the fire from us.’ But, to be\r\nshort, the _Minion’s_ men, which had always their sails in readiness,\r\nthought to make sure work, and so, without either consent of the captain\r\nor master, cut their sail.” Hawkins was “very hardly” received on board,\r\nand many of the men of the _Jesus_ were left to their fate and the mercy\r\nof the Spaniards, “which,” he says, “I doubt was very little.” Only the\r\n_Minion_ and the _Judith_ escaped, and the latter deserted that same\r\nnight. Beaten about in unknown seas for the next fourteen days, hunger at\r\nlast enforced them to seek the land; “for hides were thought very good\r\nmeat; rats, cats, mice, and dogs, none escaped that might be gotten;\r\nparrots and monkeys, that were had in great price, were thought then very\r\nprofitable if they served the turn of one dinner.” So starved and worn out\r\nwere they, that about a hundred of his people desired to be left on the\r\ncoast of Tabasco, and Hawkins determined to water there, and then, “with\r\nhis little remain of victuals,” to attempt the voyage home. During this\r\ntime, while on shore with fifty of his men, a gale arose, which prevented\r\nthem regaining the ship; indeed, they expected to see it wrecked before\r\ntheir eyes. At last the storm abated, and they sailed for England, the men\r\ndying off daily from sheer exhaustion, the pitiful remainder being\r\nscarcely able to work the ship. They at last reached the coast of Galicia,\r\nwhere they obtained fresh meat, and putting into Vigo, were assisted by\r\nsome English ships lying there. Hawkins concludes his narrative as\r\nfollows:—“If all the miseries and troublesome affairs of this sorrowful\r\nvoyage should be perfectly and thoroughly written, there should need a\r\npainful man with his pen, and as great a time as he had that wrote the\r\nlives and deaths of the martyrs.”\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: HAWKINS AT ST. JUAN DE ULLOA.]\r\n\r\nThe _Judith_, which made one of Hawkins’s last fleet, was commanded by\r\nFrancis Drake, a name that was destined to become one of the most famous\r\nof the day, and very terrible to the Spaniards. In this last venture he\r\nlost all that he had accumulated by earlier voyages, “but a divine,\r\nbelonging to the fleet, comforted him with the assurance, that having been\r\nso treacherously used by the Spaniards, he might lawfully recover in value\r\nof the King of Spain, and repair his losses upon him wherever he could.”\r\nThis comfortable doctrine consoled him. “The case,” says Fuller, “was\r\nclear in sea divinity.” Two or three minor voyages he made to gain\r\nknowledge of the field of operation, and in the West Indies made some\r\nlittle money “by playing the seaman and the pirate.” On May 24th, 1572, he\r\nsailed from Plymouth, in the _Pascha_, of seventy tons, his brother\r\naccompanying him in the _Swan_, of only twenty-five tons; they had three\r\npinnaces on board, taken to pieces and stowed away. The force with which\r\nhe was to revenge himself on the Spanish monarch, numbered seventy-three\r\nmen and boys, all told. In the Indies he was joined by Captain Rowse, of\r\nan Isle of Wight bark, with thirty-eight men on board. Let us see how they\r\nsped.\r\n\r\nIt was known that there was great treasure at Nombre de Dios, and thither\r\nthe little squadron shaped its course. The town was unwalled, and they\r\nentered without difficulty, but the Spaniards received them in the\r\nmarket-place with a volley of shot. Drake returned the greeting with a\r\nflight of arrows, “the best ancient English complement,” but in the attack\r\nreceived a wound in his leg, which he dissembled, “knowing that if the\r\ngeneral’s heart stoop, the men’s will fall.” He arrived at the\r\ntreasury-house, which was full of silver bars, and while in the act of\r\nordering his men to break it open, fainted from the loss of blood, and his\r\nmen, binding up the wound, forcibly took him to his pinnace. It was time,\r\nfor the Spaniards had discovered their weakness, and could have overcome\r\nthem. Rather disappointed here, Drake made for Carthagena, and took\r\nseveral vessels on his way. He learned from some escaped negro slaves,\r\nsettled on the isthmus of Darien, that the treasure was brought from\r\nPanama to Nombre de Dios upon mules, a party of which he might intercept.\r\nDrake’s leg having healed, he was led to an eminence on that isthmus,\r\nwhere, from a great tree, both the Pacific and Atlantic might be seen.\r\nSteps had been cut in the trunk of this huge tree, and at the top “a\r\nconvenient arbour had been made, wherein twelve men might sit.” Drake saw\r\nfrom its summit that great Southern Ocean (the Pacific Ocean) of which he\r\nhad heard something already, and “being inflamed with ambition of glory\r\nand hopes of wealth, was so vehemently transported with desire to navigate\r\nthat sea, that falling down there upon his knees, he implored the divine\r\nassistance, that he might at some time or other sail thither, and make a\r\nperfect discovery of the same.”(136) Drake was the first Englishman to\r\ngaze on its waters.\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: DRAKE’S FIRST VIEW OF THE PACIFIC]\r\n\r\nOn the isthmus, Drake encountered an armed party of Spaniards, but put\r\nthem to flight, and destroyed merchandise to the value of 200,000 ducats.\r\nSoon after he heard “the sweet music of the mules coming with a great\r\nnoise of bells,” and when the trains came up, he found they had no one but\r\nthe muleteers to protect them. It was easy work to take as much silver as\r\nthey would, but more difficult to transport it to the coast. They, in\r\nconsequence, buried several _tons_, but one of his men, who fell into the\r\nhands of the Spaniards, was compelled by torture to reveal the place, and\r\nwhen Drake’s people returned for a second load it was nearly all gone.\r\nWhen they returned to the coast where the pinnaces should have met them,\r\nthey were not to be seen, but in place, seven Spanish pinnaces which had\r\nbeen searching the coast. Drake escaped their notice, and constructing a\r\nraft of the trees which the river brought down, mounted a biscuit sack for\r\nsail, and steered it with an oar made from a sapling, out to sea, where\r\nthey were constantly up to their waists in water. At last they caught\r\nsight of their own pinnaces, ran the raft ashore, and travelled by land\r\nround to the point off which they were laying. They then embarked their\r\ncomrades with the treasure, and rejoined the ship. One of their negro\r\nallies took a great fancy to Drake’s sword, and when it was presented to\r\nhim, desired the commander to accept four wedges of gold. “Drake accepted\r\nthem as courteously as they were proffered, but threw them into the common\r\nstock, saying, it was just that they who bore part of the charge in\r\nsetting him to sea, should enjoy their full proportion of the advantage at\r\nhis return.” Drake made the passage home to the Scilly Isles in the\r\nwonderfully short period of twenty-three days. Arriving at Plymouth on a\r\nSunday, the news was carried into the church during sermon time, and\r\n“there remained few or no people with the preacher,” for Drake was already\r\na great man and a hero in the eyes of all Devon.\r\n\r\nJohn Oxenham, who had served with Drake in the varied capacities of\r\nsoldier, sailor, and cook, was very much in the latter’s confidence. Drake\r\nhad particularly spoken of his desire to explore the Pacific, and Oxenham\r\nin reply, had protested that “he would follow him by God’s grace.” The\r\nlatter, who “had gotten among the seamen the name of captain for his\r\nvalour, and had privily scraped together good store of money,” becoming\r\nimpatient, determined to attempt the enterprise his late master had\r\nprojected. He reached the isthmus to find that the mule trains conveying\r\nthe silver were now protected by a convoy of soldiers, and he determined\r\non a bold and novel adventure. “He drew his ship aground in a retired and\r\nwoody creek, covered it up with boughs, buried his provisions and his\r\ngreat guns, and taking with him two small pieces of ordnance, went with\r\nall his men and six Maroon guides about twelve leagues into the interior,\r\nto a river which discharges itself into the South Sea. There he cut wood\r\nand built a pinnace, ‘which was five-and-forty feet by the keel;’”\r\nembarked in it, and secured for himself the honour of having been the\r\nfirst Englishman to sail over the waters of the blue Pacific. In this\r\npinnace he went to the Pearl Islands, and lay in wait for vessels. He was\r\nsuccessful in capturing a small bark, bringing gold from Quito, and\r\nscarcely a week later, another with silver from Lima. He also obtained a\r\nfew pearls on the islands.\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: OXENHAM EMBARKING ON THE PACIFIC.]\r\n\r\nSo far, fortune had followed Oxenham, and to his own want of caution is\r\ndue the fact that this prosperous state of affairs was soon reversed. He\r\nhad dismissed his prizes when near the mouth of the river, and had allowed\r\nthem to perceive where he was entering. The alarm was soon given; first,\r\nindeed, by some negroes who hastened to Panama. Juan de Ortega was\r\nimmediately dispatched with 100 men, besides negro rowers, in four barks.\r\nAfter entering the river, a four days’ search rewarded him by the\r\ndiscovery of the pinnace with six Englishmen on board, who leaped ashore\r\nand ran for dear life; one only was killed at this juncture. Ortega\r\ndiscovered in the woods the hut in which Oxenham had concealed the\r\ntreasure, and removed it to his barks. Meantime, Oxenham, whose men had\r\nbeen disputing over the division of spoils, had been to a distance for the\r\npurpose of inducing some of the Maroon negroes to act as carriers, and\r\nreturning with them, met the men who had escaped from the pinnace, and\r\nthose who were fleeing from the hut. “The loss of their booty at once\r\ncompleted their reconcilement; he promised larger shares if they should\r\nsucceed in re-capturing it; and marched resolutely in quest of the\r\nSpaniards, relying upon the Maroons as well as upon his own people.” But\r\nOrtega and his men were experienced in bush-fighting, and they succeeded\r\nin killing eleven Englishmen, and five negroes, and took seven of\r\nOxenham’s party prisoners. He, with the remnant of his party, went back to\r\nsearch for his hidden ship; it had been removed by the Spaniards. And now\r\nthe latter sent 150 men to hunt the Englishmen out, while those whom they\r\nfailed to take were delivered up by the natives. Oxenham and two of his\r\nofficers were taken to Lima and executed; the remainder suffered death at\r\nPanama.\r\n\r\nThe greatest semi-commercial and piratical voyage of this epoch is\r\nundoubtedly that of Drake, who reached the South Seas(137) _viâ_ the\r\nStraits of Magellan—the third recorded attempt, and the first made by an\r\nEnglishman—and was the first English subject to circumnavigate the globe.\r\nElizabeth gave it her secret sanction, and when Drake was introduced to\r\nher court by Sir Christopher Hatton, presented him a sword, with this\r\nremarkable speech: “We do account that he which striketh at thee, Drake,\r\nstriketh at us!” The expedition, fitted at his own cost, and that of\r\nvarious adventurers, comprised five vessels; the largest, his own ship,\r\nthe _Pelican_, being only 100 tons. His whole force consisted of “164 men,\r\ngentlemen, and sailors; and was furnished with such plentiful provision of\r\nall things necessary as so long and dangerous a voyage seemed to require.”\r\nThe frames of four pinnaces were taken, to be put together as occasion\r\nmight require. “Neither did he omit, it is said, to make provision for\r\nornament and delight; carrying to this purpose with him expert musicians,\r\nrich furniture (all the vessels for his table, yea, many belonging to the\r\ncook-room, being of pure silver) with divers shows of all sorts of curious\r\nworkmanship, whereby the civility and magnificence of his native country\r\nmight, among all nations whither he should come, be the more\r\nadmired.”(138) Few of his companions knew at the outset the destination of\r\nhis voyage; it was given out that they were bound merely for Alexandria.\r\n\r\nThe expedition sailed on November 15th, 1577, from Plymouth, and\r\nimmediately encountered a storm so severe that the vessels came near\r\nshipwreck, and were obliged to put back and refit. When they had again\r\nstarted under fairer auspices, Drake gave his people some little\r\ninformation as to his proposed voyage, and appointed an island off the\r\ncoast of Barbary as a rendezvous in case of separation at sea, and\r\nsubsequently Cape Blanco, where he mustered his men ashore and put them\r\nthrough drills and warlike exercises. Already, early in January, he had\r\ntaken some minor Spanish prizes, and a little later, off the island of\r\nSantiago, chased a Portuguese ship, bound for Brazil, “with many\r\npassengers, and among other commodities, good store of wine.” Drake\r\ncaptured and set the people on one of his smaller pinnaces, giving them\r\ntheir clothes, some provisions, and one butt of wine, letting them all go\r\nexcept their pilot. The provisions and wine on board the prize proved\r\ninvaluable to the expedition. From the Cape de Verde Islands they were\r\nnine weeks out of sight of land, and before they reached the coast of\r\nBrazil, when near the equator, “Drake, being very careful of his men’s\r\nhealth, let every one of them blood with his own hands.” On nearing the\r\nBrazilian coast, the inhabitants “made great fires for a sacrifice to the\r\ndevils, about which they use conjurations (making heaps of sand and other\r\nceremonies), that when any ships shall go about to stay upon their coast,\r\nnot only sands may be gathered together in shoals in every place, but also\r\nthat storms and tempests may arise, to the casting away of ships and men.”\r\nNear the Plata they slaughtered large numbers of seals, thinking them\r\n“good and acceptable meat both as food for the present, and as a supply of\r\nprovisions for the future.” Further south, they found stages constructed\r\non the rocks by the natives for drying the flesh of ostriches; their\r\nthighs were as large as “reasonable legs of mutton.” At a spot which Drake\r\nnamed Seal Bay, they remained over a fortnight. Here they “made new\r\nprovisions of seals, whereof they slew to the number of from 200 to 300 in\r\nthe space of an hour.” Some little traffic ensued with the natives, all of\r\nwhom were highly painted, some of them having the whole of one side, from\r\ncrown to heel, painted black, and the other white. “They fed on seals and\r\nother flesh, which they ate nearly raw, casting pieces of four or six\r\npounds’ weight into the fire, till it was a little scorched, and then\r\ntearing it in pieces with their teeth like lions.” At the sound of Drake’s\r\nband of trumpeters they showed great delight, dancing on the beach with\r\nthe sailors. They were described as of large stature. “One of these\r\ngiants,” said the chaplain of the expedition, “standing with our men when\r\nthey were taking their morning draughts, showed himself so familiar that\r\nhe also would do as they did; and taking a glass in his hand (being strong\r\ncanary wine), it came no sooner to his lips, than it took him by the nose,\r\nand so suddenly entered his head, that he was so drunk, or at least so\r\novercome, that he fell right down, not able to stand; yet he held the\r\nglass fast in his hand, without spilling any of the wine; and when he came\r\nto himself, he tried again, and tasting, by degrees got to the bottom.\r\nFrom which time he took such a liking to the wine, that having learnt the\r\nname, he would every morning come down from the mountains with a mighty\r\ncry of ‘Wine! wine! wine!’ continuing the same until he arrived at the\r\ntent.”(139)\r\n\r\nAfter some trouble caused by the separation of the vessels, the whole\r\nfleet arrived safely at the “good harborough called by Magellan Port\r\nJulian,” where nearly the first sight they met was a gibbet, on which the\r\nPortuguese navigator had executed several mutinous members of his company,\r\nsome of the bones of whom yet remained. Drake himself was to have trouble\r\nhere. At the outset the natives appeared friendly, and a trial of skill in\r\nshooting arrows resulted in an English gunner exceeding their efforts, at\r\nwhich they appeared pleased by the skill shown. A little while after\r\nanother Indian came, “but of a sourer sort,” and one Winter, prepared for\r\nanother display of archery, unfortunately broke the bow-string when he\r\ndrew it to its full length. This disabused the natives, to some extent, of\r\nthe superior skill of the English, and an attack was made, apparently\r\nincited by the Indian just mentioned. Poor Winter received two wounds, and\r\nthe gunner coming to the rescue with his gun missed fire, and was\r\nimmediately shot “through the breast and out at back, so that he fell down\r\nstark dead.” Drake assembled his men, ordering them to cover themselves\r\nwith their targets, and march on the assailants, instructing them to break\r\nthe arrows shot at them, noting that the savages had but a small store.\r\n“At the same time he took the piece which had so unhappily missed fire,\r\naimed at the Indian who had killed the gunner, and who was the man who had\r\nbegun the fray, and shot him in the belly. An arrow wound, however severe,\r\nthe savage would have borne without betraying any indication of pain; but\r\nhis cries, upon being thus wounded, were so loud and hideous, that his\r\ncompanions were terrified and fled, though many were then hastening to\r\ntheir assistance. Drake did not pursue them, but hastened to convey Winter\r\nto the ship for speedy help; no help, however, availed, and he died on the\r\nsecond day. The gunner’s body, which had been left on shore, was sent for\r\nthe next day; the savages, meantime, had stripped it, as if for the sake\r\nof curiously inspecting it; the clothes they had laid under the head, and\r\nstuck an English arrow in the right eye for mockery. Both bodies were\r\nburied in a little island in the harbour.”(140) No farther attempt was\r\nmade to injure the English, who remained two months in the harbour, but\r\nfriendly relations were not established. A more serious event was to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nOne Master Doughtie was suspected and accused of something worse than\r\nordinary mutiny or insubordination. It is affirmed in a history of the\r\nvoyage published under the name of Drake’s nephew, that Doughtie had\r\nembarked on the expedition for the distinct purpose of overthrowing it for\r\nhis own aggrandisement, to accomplish which he intended to raise a mutiny,\r\nand murder the admiral and his most attached followers. Further, it is\r\nstated, that Drake was informed of this before he left Plymouth; but that\r\nhe would not credit “that a person whom he so dearly loved would conceive\r\nsuch evil purposes against him.” Doughtie had been put in possession of\r\nthe Portuguese prize, but had been removed on a charge of peculation, and\r\nit is likely that “resentment, whether for the wrongful charge, or the\r\nrightful removal, might be rankling in him;” at all events, his later\r\nconduct, and mutinous words, left no alternative to Drake but to examine\r\nhim before a properly constituted court, and he seems to have most\r\nreluctantly gone even to this length.(141) He was “found guilty by twelve\r\nmen after the English manner, and suffered accordingly.” “The most\r\nindifferent persons in the fleet,” says Southey, “were of opinion that he\r\nhad acted seditiously, and that Drake cut him off because of his emulous\r\ndesigns. The question is, how far those designs extended? He could not\r\naspire to the credit of the voyage without devising how to obtain for\r\nhimself some more conspicuous station in it than that of a gentleman\r\nvolunteer; if he regarded Drake as a rival, he must have hoped to\r\nsupplant, or at least to vie with him; and in no other way could he have\r\nvied with him but by making off with one of the ships, and trying his own\r\nfortune” (which was afterwards actually accomplished by others). Doughtie\r\nwas condemned to death. “And he,” says a writer, quoted by Hakluyt,\r\n“seeing no remedy but patience for himself, desired before his death to\r\nreceive the communion; which he did at the hands of Master Fletcher, our\r\nminister, and our general himself accompanied him in that holy action;\r\nwhich being done, and the place of execution made ready, he, having\r\nembraced our general, and taken his leave of all the company, with prayer\r\nfor the queen’s majesty and our realm, in quiet sort laid his head to the\r\nblock, where he ended his life.” One account says that after partaking of\r\nthe communion, Drake and Doughtie dined at the same table together, “as\r\ncheerfully, in sobriety, as ever in their lives they had done; and taking\r\ntheir leave by drinking to each other, as if some short journey only had\r\nbeen in hand.” A provost marshal had made all things ready, and after\r\ndrinking this funereal stirrup-cup, Doughtie went to the block. Drake\r\nsubsequently addressed the whole company, exhorting them to unity and\r\nsubordination, asking them to prepare reverently for a special celebration\r\nof the holy communion on the following Sunday.\r\n\r\nAnd now, having broken up the Portuguese prize on account of its\r\nunseaworthiness, and rechristened his own ship, the _Pelican_, into the\r\n_Golden Hinde_, Drake entered the Straits now named after Magellan, though\r\nthat navigator termed them the Patagonian Straits, because he had found\r\nthe natives wearing clumsy shoes or sandals: _patagon_ signifying in\r\nPortuguese a large, ill-shaped foot. The land surrounding the straits is\r\nhigh and mountainous, and the water generally deep close to the cliffs.\r\n“We found the strait,” says the first narrator, “to have many turnings,\r\nand as it were, shuttings up, as if there were no passage at all.” Drake\r\npassed through the tortuous strait in seventeen days. Clift, one of the\r\nhistorians of the expedition, whose narrative is preserved in Hakluyt’s\r\ncollection of “Voyages,” says of the penguins there, three thousand of\r\nwhich were killed in less than a day, “We victualled ourselves with a kind\r\nof fowl which is plentiful on that isle (St. George’s in the Straits), and\r\nwhose flesh is not unlike a fat goose here in England. They have no wings,\r\nbut short pinions, which serve their turn in swimming; their colour is\r\nsomewhat black, mixed with white spots under their belly, and about their\r\nnecks. They wall so upright that, afar off, a man would take them to be\r\nlittle children. If a man approach anything near them, they run into holes\r\nin the ground (which be not very deep) whereof the island is full, so that\r\nto take them we had staves with hooks fast to the end, wherewith some of\r\nour men pulled them out, and others being ready with cudgels did knock\r\nthem on the head, for they bite so cruelly with their crooked bills, that\r\nnone of us were able to handle them alive.”\r\n\r\nDrake’s vessels, separated by a gale, were driven hither and thither. One\r\nof them, the _Marigold_, must have foundered, as she was never again heard\r\nof. The two remaining ships sought shelter in a dangerous rocky bay, from\r\nwhich the _Golden Hinde_ was driven to sea, her cable having parted. The\r\nother vessel, under Captain Winter’s command, regained the straits, and\r\n“anchoring there in an open bay, made great fires on the shore, that if\r\nDrake should put into the strait also, he might discover them.” Winter\r\nproceeded later up the straits, and anchored in a sound, which he named\r\nthe Port of Health, because his men, who had been “very sick with long\r\nwatching, wet, cold, and evil diet,” soon recovered on the nourishing\r\nshell-fish found there. He, after waiting some time, and despairing of\r\nregaining Drake’s company, gave over the voyage, and set sail for England,\r\n“where he arrived with the reproach of having abandoned his commander.”\r\n\r\nDrake was now reduced to his own vessel, the _Golden Hinde_, which was\r\nobliged to seek shelter on the coast of Terra del Fuego. The winds again\r\nforced him from his anchorage, and his shallop, with eight men on board,\r\nand provisions for only one day, was separated from him. The fate of these\r\npoor fellows was tragical. They regained the straits, where they caught\r\nand salted a quantity of penguins, and then coasted up South America to\r\nthe Plata. Six of them landed, and while searching for food in the\r\nforests, encountered a party of Indians, who wounded all of them with\r\ntheir arrows, and secured four, pursuing the others to the boat. These\r\nlatter reached the two men in charge, but before they could put off, all\r\nwere wounded by the natives. They, however, succeeded in reaching an\r\nisland some distance from the mainland, where two of them died from the\r\ninjuries received, and the boat was wrecked and beaten to pieces on the\r\nrocks. The remaining two stopped on the island eight weeks, living on\r\nshell-fish and a fruit resembling an orange, but could find no water. They\r\nat length ventured to the mainland on a large plank some ten feet in\r\nlength, which they propelled with paddles; the passage occupied three\r\ndays. “On coming to land,” says Carter, the only survivor, “we found a\r\nrivulet of sweet water; when William Pitcher, my only comfort and\r\ncompanion (although I endeavoured to dissuade him) overdrank himself, and\r\nto my unspeakable grief, died within half an hour.” Carter himself fell\r\ninto the hands of some Indians, who took pity on him, and conducted him to\r\na Portuguese settlement. Nine years elapsed before he was able to regain\r\nhis own country.\r\n\r\n                      [Illustration: SIR F. DRAKE.]\r\n\r\nMeantime Drake was driven so far to the southward, that at length he “fell\r\nin with the uttermost part of the land towards the South Pole,” or in\r\nother words, reached Cape Horn. The storm had lasted with little\r\nintermission for over seven weeks. “Drake went ashore, and, sailor-like,\r\nleaning over a promontory, as far as he safely could, came back and told\r\nhis people how that he had been farther south than any man living.” At\r\nlast the wind was favourable, and he coasted northward, along the American\r\nshore, till he reached the island of Mocha, where the Indians appeared at\r\nfirst to be friendly, and brought off potatoes, roots, and two fat sheep,\r\nfor which they received recompense. But on landing for the purpose of\r\nwatering the ship, the natives shot at them, wounding every one of twelve\r\nmen, and Drake himself under the right eye. In this case no attempt was\r\nmade at retaliation. The Indians doubtless took them for Spaniards. Drake,\r\ncontinuing his voyage, fell in with an Indian fishing from a canoe, who\r\nwas made to understand their want of provisions, and was sent ashore with\r\npresents. This brought off a number of natives with supplies of poultry,\r\nhogs, and fruits, while Felipe, one of them who spoke Spanish, informed\r\nDrake that they had passed the port of Valparaiso—then an insignificant\r\nsettlement of less than a dozen Spanish families—where a large ship was\r\nlying at anchor. Felipe piloted them thither, and they soon discovered the\r\nship, with a meagre crew of eight Spaniards and four negroes on board. So\r\nlittle was an enemy expected, that as Drake’s vessel approached, it was\r\nsaluted with beat of drum, and a jar of Chili wine made ready for an\r\nhospitable reception. But Drake and his men wanted something more than\r\nbumpers of wine, and soon boarded the vessel, one of the men striking down\r\nthe first Spaniard he met, and exclaiming, “_Abaxo perro!_” (Down, dog!)\r\nAnother of the crew leaped overboard and swam ashore to give an alarm to\r\nthe town; the rest were soon secured under hatches. The inhabitants of the\r\ntown fled incontinently, but the spoils secured there were small. The\r\nchapel was rifled of its altar-cloth, silver chalice, and other articles,\r\nwhich were handed over to Drake’s chaplain; quantities of wine and other\r\nprovisions were secured. The crew of the prize, with the exception of the\r\nGreek pilot, were set ashore, and Drake left with his new acquisition,\r\nwhich when examined at sea was found to contain one thousand seven hundred\r\nand seventy jars of wine, sixty thousand pieces of gold, some pearls, and\r\nother articles of value. The Indian who had guided them to this piece of\r\ngood fortune, was liberally rewarded.\r\n\r\nAt a place called Tarapaca, whither they had gone to water the ship, they\r\nfound a Spaniard lying asleep, and keeping very bad guard over thirteen\r\nbars of silver, worth four thousand ducats. Drake determined to take care\r\nof it for him. At a short distance off, they encountered another, who,\r\nwith an Indian, was driving eight llamas, each carrying a hundredweight of\r\nsilver. It is needless to say that the llamas were conveyed on board,\r\n_plus_ the silver. At Arica two ships were found at anchor, one of which\r\nyielded forty bars of silver, and the other a considerable quantity of\r\nwine. But these were as trifles to that which followed.\r\n\r\nDrake had pursued a leisurely course, but in spite of this fact, no\r\nintelligence of the pirate’s approach had reached Lima. The term “pirate”\r\nis used advisedly, for whatever the gain to geographical science afforded\r\nby his voyages, their chief aim was spoil, and it mattered nothing whether\r\nEngland was at war with the victims of his prowess or not. A few leagues\r\noff Callao harbour (the port of Lima), Drake boarded a Portuguese vessel:\r\nthe owner agreed to pilot him into Callao, provided his cargo was left\r\nhim. They arrived at nightfall, “sailing in between all the ships that lay\r\nthere, seventeen in number,” most of which had their sails ashore, for the\r\nSpaniards had had, as yet, no enemies in those waters. They rifled the\r\nships of their valuables, and these included a large quantity of silk and\r\nlinen, and one chest of silver reales. But they heard that which made\r\ntheir ears tingle, and inflamed their desires for gain; the _Cacafuego_, a\r\ngreat treasure ship, had sailed only a few days before for a neighbouring\r\nport. Drake immediately cut the cables of the ships at Lima, and let them\r\ndrive, that they might not pursue him. “While he was thus employed, a\r\nvessel from Panama, laden with Spanish goods, entered the harbour, and\r\nanchored close by the _Golden Hinde_. A boat came from the shore to search\r\nit; but because it was night, they deferred the search till the morning,\r\nand only sent a man on board. The boat then came alongside Drake’s vessel,\r\nand asked what ship it was. A Spanish prisoner answered, as he was\r\nordered, that it was Miguel Angel’s, from Chili. Satisfied with this, the\r\nofficer in the boat sent a man to board it; but he, when on the point of\r\nentering, perceived one of the large guns, and retreated in the boat with\r\nall celerity, because no vessels that frequented that port, and navigated\r\nthose seas, carried great shot.” The crew of the Panama ship took alarm\r\nwhen they observed the rapid flight of the man, and put to sea. The\r\n_Hinde_ followed her, and the Spanish crew abandoned their ship, and\r\nescaped ashore in their boat. The alarm had now been given in Lima, and\r\nthe viceroy dispatched two vessels in pursuit, each having two hundred men\r\non board, but no artillery. The Spanish commander, however, showed no\r\ndesire to tackle Drake, and he escaped, taking shortly afterwards three\r\ntolerable prizes, one of which yielded forty bars of silver, eighty\r\npounds’ weight of gold, and a golden crucifix, “set with goodly great\r\nemeralds.” One of the men having secreted two plates of gold from this\r\nprize, and denied the theft, was immediately hanged.\r\n\r\nBut it was the _Cacafuego_ that Drake wanted, and after crossing the line\r\nhe promised to give his own chain of gold to the first man who should\r\ndescry her. On St. David’s Day, the coveted prize was discovered from the\r\ntop, by a namesake of the commander, one John Drake. All sail was set, but\r\nan easy capture was before them; for the Spanish captain, not dreaming of\r\nenemies in those latitudes, slackened sail, in order to find out what ship\r\nshe was. When they had approached near enough, Drake hailed them to\r\nstrike, which being refused, “with a great piece he shot her mast\r\noverboard, and having wounded the master with an arrow, the ship yielded.”\r\nHaving taken possession, the vessels sailed in company far out to sea,\r\nwhen they stopped and lay by. She proved a prize indeed: gold and silver\r\nin coin and bars, jewels and precious stones amounting to three hundred\r\nand sixty thousand pieces of gold were taken from her. The silver alone\r\namounted to a value in our money of £212,000. It is stated that Drake\r\ncalled for the register of the treasure on board, and wrote a receipt for\r\nthe amount! The ship was dismissed, and Drake gave the captain a letter of\r\nsafe conduct, in case she should fall in with his consorts. This, as we\r\nknow, was impossible.\r\n\r\nDrake’s plain course now was to make his way home, and he wisely argued\r\nthat it would be unsafe to attempt the voyage by the route he had come, as\r\nthe Spaniards would surely attack him in full force, the whole coast of\r\nChili and Peru being aroused to action. He conceived the bold notion of\r\nrounding North America: in other words, he proposed to make that passage\r\nwhich has been the great dream of Arctic explorers, and which has only, as\r\nwe shall hereafter see, been once made (and that in a very partial sense)\r\nby Franklin and M’Clure. His company agreed to his views: firstly to\r\nrefit, water, and provision the ship in some convenient bay;\r\n“thenceforward,” says one of them, “to hasten on our intended journey for\r\nthe discovery of the said passage, through which we might with joy return\r\nto our longed homes.” They sailed for Nicaragua, near the mainland of\r\nwhich they found a small island with a suitable bay, where they obtained\r\nwood, water, and fish. A small prize was taken while there, having on\r\nboard a cargo of sarsaparilla, which they disdained, and butter and honey,\r\nwhich they appropriated. Drake now sailed northward, and most undoubtedly\r\nreached the grand bay of San Francisco. Californian authorities concede\r\nthis. The “Drake’s Bay” of the charts is an open roadstead, and does not\r\nanswer the descriptions given of the great navigator’s visit. He had\r\npeaceful interviews with the natives, and took possession, in the fashion\r\nof those days, of the country, setting up a monument of the queen’s “right\r\nand title to the same, namely, a plate nailed upon a fair great post,\r\nwhereupon was engraven her Majesty’s name, the day and year of our arrival\r\nthere, ... together with her highness’s picture and arms in a piece of\r\n_sixpence_ (!) of current English money under the plate, where under also\r\nwas written the name of our general.” History does not tell us the fate of\r\nthat sixpence, but the title, New Albion, bestowed on the country by\r\nDrake, remained on the maps half way into this century, or just before the\r\ndiscovery of gold in California. The natives regarded the English with\r\nsuperstitious awe, and could not be prevented from offering them\r\nsacrifices, “with lamentable weeping, scratching, and tearing the flesh\r\nfrom their faces with their nails, whereof issued abundance of blood.”\r\n“But we used,” says the narrator quoted by Hakluyt, “signs to them of\r\ndisliking this, and stayed their hands from force, and directed them\r\nupwards to the living God, whom only they ought to worship.” After\r\nremaining there five weeks, Drake took his departure, and the natives\r\nwatched the ships sadly as they sailed, and kept fires burning on the\r\nhill-tops as long as they continued in sight. “Good store of seals and\r\nbirds” were taken from the Farralone Islands. Many an egg has the writer\r\neaten, laid by the descendants of those very birds: they are supplied in\r\nquantities to the San Francisco markets. Drake’s attempt at the northern\r\npassage was now abandoned.\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: DRAKE’S ARRIVAL AT TERNATE.]\r\n\r\nSixty-eight days was Drake’s ship—containing one of the most valuable\r\nfreights ever held in one bottom—in the open sea, during which time no\r\nland was sighted; at the end of this period the Pelew, Philippine, and\r\nMolucca Islands were successively reached. At Ternate, Drake sent a velvet\r\ncloak as a present to the king, requesting provisions, and that he might\r\nbe allowed to trade for spices. The king was amiable and well disposed; he\r\nsent before him “four great and large canoes, in every one whereof were\r\ncertain of his greatest states that were about him, attired in white lawn\r\nof cloth of Calicut, having over their heads, from the one end of the\r\ncanoe to the other, a covering of thin perfumed mats, borne up with a\r\nframe made of reeds for the same use, under which every one did sit in his\r\norder, according to his dignity, to keep him from the heat of the sun.\r\n* * * The rest were soldiers which stood in comely order, round about on\r\nboth sides; without whom sat the rowers in certain galleries, which being\r\nthree on a side all along the canoes, did lie off from the side thereof\r\nthree or four yards, one being orderly builded lower than another, in\r\nevery of which galleries were fourscore rowers. These canoes were\r\nfurnished with warlike munitions, every man, for the most part, having his\r\nsword and target, with his dagger, besides other weapons, as lances,\r\ncalivers, darts, bows and arrows; also every canoe had a small cast-base\r\n(or cannon) mounted at the least one full yard upon a stock set upright.”\r\nThese canoes or galleys were rowed about the ship, those on board doing\r\nhomage as they passed. The king soon arrived in state, and was received\r\n“with a salute of great guns, with trumpets sounding, and such politic\r\ndisplay of state and strength as Drake knew it was advisable to exhibit.”\r\nMany presents were made to the king, who in return sent off provisions of\r\nrice, fowls, fruits, sugar-cane, and “imperfect and liquid sugar”\r\n(presumably molasses). Next day there was a grand reception ashore; the\r\nking, covered with gold and jewels, under a rich canopy embossed with\r\ngold, professing great friendship. The fact was that his own father had\r\nbeen assassinated by the Portuguese, and he himself had besieged and taken\r\ntheir Fort St. Paul’s, and compelled them to leave it. He was, doubtless,\r\nanxious for some alliance which might strengthen his hands against the\r\nPortuguese. Drake, however, had no commission, nor desire at that time to\r\nengage his country to any such treaty; his principal object now was to get\r\nhome safely with his treasure. He, however, successfully traded for a\r\nquantity of cloves and provisions.\r\n\r\nOff Celebes, the _Hinde_ became entangled among the shoals, and while\r\nrunning under full sail, suddenly struck on a rock, where she stuck fast.\r\nBoats were got out to see whether an anchor might not be employed to draw\r\nthe ship off, but the water all round was very deep, no bottom being\r\nfound. Three tons of cloves, eight guns, and certain stores were thrown\r\noverboard, but to no purpose. Fuller says quaintly, that they “threw\r\noverboard as much wealth as would break the heart of a miser to think\r\non’t; with much sugar, and packs of spices, making a caudle of the sea\r\nround about. Then they betook themselves to their prayers, the best lever\r\nat such a dead lift indeed, and it pleased God that the wind, formerly\r\ntheir mortal enemy, became their friend.”(142) To the joy of all, the\r\n_Hinde_ glided off the rocks, and almost uninjured. On the way home they\r\nvisited Barateva, Java, the Cape, and Sierra Leone, being singularly\r\nfortunate in avoiding the Portuguese and Spanish ships. The _Hinde_\r\narrived safely at Plymouth on September 26th, 1580, having been nearly\r\nthree years on her eventful voyage. Drake was received with great honour,\r\nand was knighted by the queen. She gave orders that his little ship should\r\nbe laid up at Deptford, and there carefully preserved as a monument of the\r\nmost remarkable voyage yet made. Elizabeth honoured Drake by banqueting on\r\nboard, and his fame spread everywhere through the kingdom. The boys of\r\nWestminster School set up some Latin verses on the mainmast, of which\r\nSouthey gives the following free translation—\r\n\r\n  “On Hercules’ Pillars, Drake, thou may’st _plus ultra_ write full well,\r\n  And say, I will in greatness that great Hercules excel.”\r\n\r\nAnd again—\r\n\r\n  “Sir Drake, whom well the world’s end knows, which thou didst compass\r\n              round,\r\n  And whom both poles of heaven once saw which north and south do bound,\r\n  The stars above will make thee known if men here silent were;\r\n  The sun himself cannot forget his fellow-traveller.”\r\n\r\nDrake’s series of victories over the Spaniards, and the repulse which\r\noccurred just before his death are details of history which would fill a\r\nvolume. He received a sailor’s funeral at Puerto Bello, his body being\r\ncommitted to the deep in a leaden coffin, with the solemn service of the\r\nEnglish Church, rendered more impressive by volleys of musketry, and the\r\nbooming of guns from all the fleet. A poet of the day says—\r\n\r\n  “The waves became his winding sheet, the waters were his tomb;\r\n  But for his fame the ocean sea was not sufficient room.”\r\n\r\nNo single name in naval history has ever attained the celebrity acquired\r\nby Drake. The Spaniards, who called him a dragon, believed that he had\r\ndealings with the devil; “that notion,” says Southey, “prevented them from\r\nfeeling any mortification at his successes, * * * and it enhanced their\r\nexultation over the failure of his last expedition, which they considered\r\nas the triumph of their religion over heresy and magic.” The common people\r\nin England itself, more especially in the western counties, believed any\r\nquantity of fables concerning him, some of them verging on childishness.\r\nHe had only to cast a chip in the water when it would become a fine\r\nvessel. “It was not by his skill as an engineer, and the munificent\r\nexpenditure of the wealth which he had so daringly obtained, that Drake\r\nsupplied Plymouth with fresh water; but by mounting his horse, riding\r\nabout Dartmoor till he came to a spring sufficiently copious for his\r\ndesign, then wheeling round, pronouncing some magical words, and galloping\r\nback into the town, with the stream in full flow, and forming its own\r\nchannel at the horse’s heels.” One of the popular stories regarding him is\r\nbriefly as follows. When Sir Francis left on one of his long voyages, he\r\ntold his wife that should he not return within a certain number of years\r\nshe might conclude that he was dead, and might, if she so chose, wed\r\nagain. One version places the time at seven, and another at ten years.\r\nDuring these long years the excellent lady remained true to her lord, but\r\nat the end of the term accepted an offer. “One of Drake’s ministering\r\nspirits, whose charge it was to convey to him any intelligence in which he\r\nwas nearly concerned, brought him the tidings. Immediately he loaded one\r\nof his great guns, and fired it right through the globe on one side, and\r\nup on the other, with so true an aim that it made its way into the church,\r\nbetween the two parties most concerned, just as the marriage service was\r\nbeginning. ‘It comes from Drake!’ cried the wife to the now unbrided\r\nbridegroom; ‘he is alive! and there must be neither troth nor ring between\r\nthee and me.’”\r\n\r\nDrake is described as of low stature, but well set, and of an admirable\r\npresence. His chest was broad, his hair nut-brown, his beard handsome and\r\nfull, his head “remarkably round,” his eyes large and clear, his\r\ncountenance fresh, cheerful and engaging. “It has been said of him that he\r\nwas a willing hearer of every man’s opinion, but commonly a follower of\r\nhis own,” which, as a rule, was really sure to be judicious. He had a\r\nquick temper, and once offended, was “hard to be reconciled,” but his\r\nfriendships were firm; he was ambitious to the last degree, and “the\r\nvanity which usually accompanies that sin laid him open to flattery.” He\r\nwas affable with his men, who idolised him as the grand commander and\r\nskilful seaman that he most undoubtedly was.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the rich prizes so often taken, a competent authority says:\r\n“The expeditions undertaken in Elizabeth’s reign against the Spaniards are\r\nsaid to have produced no advantage to England in any degree commensurate\r\nwith the cost of money and expense of life with which they were\r\nperformed.” But we must never forget the wonderful development of the navy\r\nwhich resulted; the splendid training acquired by our sailors, and the\r\ngrand gains to geographical science.\r\n\r\nThe opening of colonisation and trade with America—so far as England is\r\nconcerned—is due to Sir Humphrey Gilbert, and his step-brother, Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh. From their comparatively insignificant attempts at settling parts\r\nof that vast northern continent what grand results have accrued! The acorn\r\nhas become a mighty, wide-spreading oak, sheltering the representatives of\r\nevery nationality.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Humphrey Gilbert proposed to Queen Elizabeth the settlement of a\r\ncolony in the New World, she immediately assented, and granted him letters\r\npatent as comprehensive and wide-spreading as ever issued by papal\r\nsanction. She accorded free liberty to him, his heirs and assigns for\r\never, to discover and take possession of any heathen and savage lands not\r\nbeing actually possessed by any Christian prince or people; such\r\ncountries, and all towns, castles or villages, to be holden by them of the\r\ncrown, payment of a fifth of all the gold and silver ore discovered being\r\nrequired by the latter. The privileges seemed so great that “very many\r\ngentlemen of good estimation drew unto Sir Humphrey to associate with him\r\nin so commendable an enterprise.” But divisions and feuds arose, and\r\nGilbert went to sea only to become involved in a “dangerous sea-fight, in\r\nwhich many of his company were slain, and his ships were battered and\r\ndisabled.” He was compelled to put back “with the loss of a tall ship.”\r\nThe records of this encounter are meagre, but the disaster retarded for\r\nthe time his attempt at colonisation, besides impairing his estate.\r\n\r\nSir Humphrey’s patent was only for six years, unless he succeeded in his\r\nproject, and in 1583 he found means to equip a second expedition, to which\r\nRaleigh contributed a bark of 200 tons, named after him, the little fleet\r\nnumbering in all five vessels. The queen had always favoured Gilbert, and\r\nbefore he departed on this voyage, sent him a golden anchor with a large\r\npearl on it, by the hands of Raleigh. In the letter accompanying it,\r\nRaleigh wrote, “Brother, I have sent you a token from her Majesty—an\r\nanchor guided by a lady, as you see. And, further, her highness willed me\r\nto send you word, that she wished you as great a good hap and safety to\r\nyour ship, as if she herself were there in person, desiring you to have\r\ncare of yourself as of that which she tendereth; and, therefore, for her\r\nsake you must provide for it accordingly. Further she commandeth that you\r\nleave your picture with me.” Elizabeth’s direct interest in the rapidly\r\nincreasing maritime and commercial interests of the day was very apparent\r\nin all her actions.\r\n\r\n_Bark Raleigh_ was the largest vessel of the expedition, two of the others\r\nbeing of forty, and one of twenty tons only. The number of those who\r\nembarked was about 260, and the list included carpenters, shipwrights,\r\nmasons, and smiths; also “mineral men and refiners.” It is admitted that\r\namong them there were many “who had been taken as pirates in the narrow\r\nseas, instead of being hanged according to their deserts.” “For solace of\r\nour people,” says one of the captains under Gilbert, “and allurement of\r\nthe savages, we were provided of music in good variety, not omitting the\r\nleast toys, as morris-dancers, hobby-horse, and May-like conceits to\r\ndelight the savage people, whom we intended to win by all fair means\r\npossible.” The period of starting being somewhat late in the season, it\r\nwas determined to sail first for Newfoundland instead of Cape Florida, as\r\nat the former Gilbert knew that he could obtain abundant supplies from the\r\nnumerous ships employed in the abundant cod-fisheries. The voyage was to\r\ncommence in disaster. They sailed on June 11th, and two days later the men\r\nof the _Bark Raleigh_ hailed their companions with the information that\r\ntheir captain and many on board were grievously sick. She left them that\r\nnight and put back to Plymouth, where, it is stated, she arrived with a\r\nnumber of the crew prostrated by a contagious disease. Some mystery\r\nattaches to this defection; “the others proceeded on their way, not a\r\nlittle grieved with the loss of the most puissant ship in their fleet.”\r\nTwo of the fleet parted company in a fog; one of them was found in the Bay\r\nof Conception, her men in new apparel and particularly well provided, the\r\nsecret being that they had boarded an unfortunate Newfoundland ship on the\r\nway, and had pretty well rifled it, not even stopping at torture where the\r\nwretched sailors had objected to be stripped of their possessions. The\r\nother vessel was found lying off the harbour of St. John’s, where at first\r\nthe English merchants objected to Gilbert’s entry, till he assured them\r\nthat he came with a commission from her Majesty, and had no ill-intent. On\r\nthe way in, his vessel struck on a rock, whereupon the other captains sent\r\nto the rescue, saved the ship, and fired a salute in his honour. His first\r\nact was to tax all the ships for his own supply; the Portuguese, in\r\nparticular, contributed liberally, so that the crews were “presented,\r\nabove their allowances, with wines, marmalades, most fine rusk or biscuit,\r\nsweet oil, and sundry delicacies.” Then the merchants and masters were\r\nassembled to hear his commission read, and possession of the harbour and\r\ncountry for 200 leagues every way was taken in the name of the queen. A\r\nwooden pillar was erected on the spot, and the arms of England, engraved\r\non lead, were affixed. The lands lying by the water side were granted to\r\ncertain of the adventurers and merchants, they covenanting to pay rent and\r\nservice to Gilbert, his heirs and assigns for ever.\r\n\r\nSome of the before-mentioned pirates of the expedition gave Sir Humphrey a\r\nconsiderable amount of trouble while at St. John’s, some deserting, and\r\nothers plotting to steal away the shipping by night. A number of them\r\nstole a ship laden with fish, setting the crew on shore. When ready to\r\nsail, he found that there were not sufficient hands for all his vessels,\r\nand the _Swallow_ was left for the purpose of transporting home a number\r\nof the sick. He selected for himself the smallest of his fleet, the\r\n_Squirrel_, described as a “frigate” of ten tons, as most suitable for\r\nexploring the coasts. But that which made him of good heart was a sample\r\nof silver ore which one of his miners had discovered; “he doubted not to\r\nborrow £10,000 of the queen, for his next voyage, upon the credit of this\r\nmine.”\r\n\r\nFor eight days they followed the coast towards Cape Breton, at the end of\r\nwhich time the wind rose, bringing thick fog and rain, so that they could\r\nnot see a cable’s length before them. They were driven among shoals and\r\nbreakers, and their largest ship was wrecked in a moment. “They in the\r\nother vessel,” says Hayes,(143) “saw her strike, and her stern presently\r\nbeaten to pieces; whereupon the frigate in which was the general, and the\r\n_Golden Hinde_ cast about, even for our lives, into the wind’s eye,\r\nbecause that way carried us to the seaward. Making out from this danger,\r\nwe sounded one while seven fathoms, then five, then four, and less; again\r\ndeeper, immediately four fathom, then but three, the sea going mightily\r\nand high. At last we recovered (God be thanked!) in some despair to sea\r\nroom enough. All that day, and part of the night, we beat up and down as\r\nnear unto the wreck as was possible, but all in vain. This was a heavy and\r\ngrievous event to lose our chief ship, freighted with great provision; but\r\nworse was the loss of our men, to the number of almost a hundred souls;\r\namongst whom was drowned a learned man, an Hungarian, born in the city of\r\nBuda, called thereof Budæus, who out of piety and zeal to good attempts,\r\nadventured in this action, minding to record in the Latin tongue, the\r\ngests and things worthy of remembrance happening in this discovery to the\r\nhonour of our nation. Here, also, perished our Saxon refiner, and\r\ndiscoverer of inestimable riches. Maurice Brown, the captain, when advised\r\nto shift for his life in the pinnace, refused to quit the ship, lest it\r\nshould be thought to have been lost through his default. With this mind he\r\nmounted upon the highest deck, where he attended imminent death and\r\nunavoidable,—how long, I leave it to God, who withdraweth not his comfort\r\nfrom his servants at such a time.” Of the company only ten were saved in a\r\nsmall pinnace which was piloted to Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nMeantime, on board the remaining vessels, there was much suffering, and\r\nSir Humphrey was obliged to yield to the general desire, and sail for\r\nEngland, having “compassion upon his poor men, in whom he saw no lack of\r\ngood will, but of means fit to perform the action they came for.” He\r\npromised his subordinate officers to set them forth “royally the next\r\nspring,” if God should spare them. But it was not so to be.\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: THE DEATH OF SIR HUMPHREY GILBERT.]\r\n\r\nSir Humphrey Gilbert was entreated, when one day he had come on board the\r\n_Hinde_, to remain there, instead of risking himself “in the frigate,\r\nwhich was overcharged with nettage, and small artillery,” to which he\r\nanswered, “I will not forsake my little company going homewards, with whom\r\nI have passed so many storms and perils.” A short time afterwards, while\r\nexperiencing “foul weather and terrible seas, breaking short and high,\r\npyramidwise, men which all their life had occupied the sea never saw it\r\nmore outrageous,” the frigate was nearly engulfed, but recovered. Gilbert,\r\nsitting abaft with a book in his hand, cried out to the crew of the\r\n_Hinde_ in the following noble words, so often since recorded in poetry\r\nand prose: “Courage, my lads! We are as near to heaven by sea as by land!”\r\nThat same night the lights of the little vessel were suddenly missed, and\r\nGilbert and his gallant men were engulfed in the depths for ever. Of such\r\nmen we may appropriately say with the poet Campbell—\r\n\r\n  “The deck it was their field of fame,\r\n  And Ocean was their grave.”\r\n\r\nThe _Hinde_ reached Falmouth in safety, though sadly shattered and torn.\r\n\r\nBut the spirit of enterprise then prevailing was not to be easily quashed,\r\nand only a few months after the failure of poor Gilbert’s enterprise, we\r\nfind Sir Walter Raleigh in the field. He obtained letters of patent\r\nsimilar to those before mentioned, and was aided by several persons of\r\nwealth, particularly Sir Richard Greenville and Mr. William Saunderson.\r\nTwo barks, under Captains Amadas and Barlow, were sent to a part of the\r\nAmerican continent north of the Gulf of Florida, and after skirting the\r\ncoast for one hundred and twenty miles, a suitable haven was found, the\r\nland round which was immediately taken for the queen with the usual\r\nformalities. After sundry minor explorations they returned to England,\r\nwhere they gave a glowing account of the country. It was “so full of\r\ngrapes that the very beating and surge of the sea overflowed them.” The\r\nvegetation was so rich and abundant that one of the captains thought that\r\n“in all the world the like abundance is not to be found,” while the woods\r\nwere full of deer and smaller game. The cedars were “the highest and\r\nreddest in the world,” while among smaller trees was that bearing “the\r\nrind of black cinnamon.” The inhabitants were kind and gentle, and void of\r\ntreason, “handsome and goodly people in their behaviour, as mannerly and\r\ncivil as any of Europe.” It is true that “they had a mortal malice against\r\na certain neighbouring nation; that their wars were very cruel and bloody,\r\nand that by reason thereof, and of civil dissensions which had happened of\r\nlate years amongst them, the people were marvellously wasted, and in some\r\nplaces the country left desolate.” These little discrepancies were passed\r\nover, and Elizabeth was so well pleased with the accounts brought home,\r\nthat she named the country Virginia; not merely because it was discovered\r\nin the reign of a virgin queen, but “because it did still seem to retain\r\nthe virgin purity and plenty of the first creation, and the people their\r\nprimitive innocence.” These happy natives were described as living after\r\nthe manner of the golden age; as free from toil, spending their time in\r\nfishing, fowling, and hunting, and gathering the fruits of the earth,\r\nwhich ripened without their care. They had no boundaries to their lands,\r\nnor individual property in cattle, but shared and shared alike. All this,\r\nwhich was rather too good to be absolutely true, seems to have been\r\nimplicitly believed. The letters of patent, however, granted to poor Sir\r\nHumphrey Gilbert, and subsequently to Sir Walter Raleigh, mark a most\r\nimportant epoch in the world’s history, for from those small\r\nstarting-points date the English efforts at colonising America—the great\r\nNew World of the past, the present, and the future. Where then a few naked\r\nsavages lurked and lazed, fished and hunted, forty millions of\r\nEnglish-speaking people now dwell, whose interests on and about the sea,\r\nrising in importance every day, are scarcely excelled by those of any\r\nnation on the globe, except our own. Some points in connection with this\r\ncolonisation, bearing as they do on the history of the sea and maritime\r\naffairs, will be treated in the succeeding volume.\r\n\r\nThe reader, who while living “at home in ease,” has voyaged in spirit with\r\nthe writer over so much of the globe’s watery surface, visiting its most\r\ndistant shores, will not be one of those who under-rate\r\n\r\n  “The dangers of the seas.”\r\n\r\nNor will current events allow us to forget them. “The many voices” of\r\nocean—as Michelet puts it—its murmur and its menace, its thunder and its\r\nroar, its wail, its sigh, rise from the watery graves of six hundred brave\r\nmen, who but a few weeks ago formed the bulk of two crews, the one of a\r\nnoble English frigate, the other a splendid German ironclad, both lost\r\nwithin sight of our own shores. Early in this volume wooden walls were\r\ncompared with armoured vessels, and we are painfully reminded by the loss\r\nof both the _Eurydice_ and _Grosser Kurfüst_ how unsettled is the question\r\nin its practical bearings. Its discussion must also be resumed as a part\r\nof the history of ships and shipping in the ensuing volume. Till then,\r\nkind reader, adieu!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             END OF VOLUME I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     CASSELL, PETTER, GALPIN & CO., BELLE SAUVAGE WORKS, LONDON, E.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                FOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n    1 Milton.\r\n\r\n    2 Pindar.\r\n\r\n    3 “La Mer.” There is much truth in Michelet’s charming work, but\r\n      often, as above, presented in an exaggerated form. Animals, in\r\n      reality, soon become accustomed to the sea. They show generally,\r\n      however, a considerable amount of indisposition to go on board a\r\n      vessel.\r\n\r\n    4 W. S.

The Russians were stronger, but this did not\r\n      determine the battle; their success was won because they were well\r\n      supplied with large shells and shell-guns, while the Turks had\r\n      nothing more effective than 24-pounders. Their wooden vessels were\r\n      speedily on fire, and the Russians won an easy success. Shells were\r\n      no novelty, yet a great sea-fight had never before been, as it was\r\n      then, won by their exclusive agency.\r\n\r\n   11 The Hon. S. J. G. Calthorpe, “Letters from Head-quarters.”\r\n\r\n   12 The seven Russian ships sunk at the entrance of the harbour of\r\n      Sebastopol were of no small size or value, and they were scuttled in\r\n      a hurry so great that they had all their guns, ammunition, and\r\n      stores on board, and their rigging standing. They comprised five\r\n      line-of-battle ships, two of them eighty, two eighty-four, and one\r\n      120 guns, and two frigates of forty guns; a total of 528 guns.\r\n      Afterwards it became a common report that vessels had been disabled\r\n      and sunk in the harbour. On the night of the 5th of September, just\r\n      before the evacuation of the town, two large Russian men-of-war\r\n      caught fire and burned fiercely, illumining the harbour and town,\r\n      and causing great excitement, as an omen of coming doom. The night\r\n      of the memorable 8th, when the Russians gave up all further idea of\r\n      resistance, and left the town to take care of itself, witnessed the\r\n      sinking of the remainder of the Black Sea fleet. So far, therefore,\r\n      the presence of our fleet had a pronounced moral effect, without\r\n      involving further loss of life.\r\n\r\n   13 Cust, “Annals of the Wars of the Eighteenth Century.”\r\n\r\n   14 Drinkwater, “Siege of Gibraltar.”\r\n\r\n   15 Some have even gone so far as to consider Louis Napoleon the\r\n      inventor of iron-plated and armoured vessels. This is absurd. The\r\n      ancients knew the use of plates of iron or brass for covering ships\r\n      of war and battering-rams. One of Hiero’s greatest galleys was\r\n      covered that way. That it must come to this sooner or later was the\r\n      published idea of many, both in this country and in France. The\r\n      Emperor’s sagacity, however, was always fully alive to questions of\r\n      the kind.\r\n\r\n   16 The report of the Chief Engineer and Naval Constructor of the\r\n      Confederate Service, in regard to the conversion of the _Merrimac_\r\n      into an armoured vessel, distinctly stated that from the effects of\r\n      fire she was “useless for any other purpose, without incurring a\r\n      very heavy expense for rebuilding.”\r\n\r\n   17 The official reports state that she was plated, many popular\r\n      accounts averring that she was only covered with “railroad iron.”\r\n      The information presented here is drawn from the following\r\n      sources:—“The Rebellion Record,” a voluminous work, edited by Frank\r\n      Moore, of New York, and which contains all the leading official\r\n      war-documents, both of the Federals and Confederates; the statement\r\n      of Mr. A. B. Smith, pilot of the _Cumberland_, one of the survivors\r\n      of the fight; the Baltimore _American_, and the Norfolk _Day Book_,\r\n      both newspapers published near the scene of action. There is great\r\n      unanimity in the accounts published on both sides.\r\n\r\n   18 The pilot of the _Cumberland_.\r\n\r\n   19 “Finally, after about three-fourths of an hour of the most severe\r\n      fighting, our vessel sank, the Stars and Stripes still waving. That\r\n      flag was finally submerged; but after the hull grounded on the\r\n      sands, fifty-four feet below the surface of the water, our pennant\r\n      was still flying from the top mast above the waves.” (The Pilot of\r\n      the _Cumberland’s_ Narrative.)\r\n\r\n   20 The original _Monitor_, from which that class of vessel took its\r\n      name.\r\n\r\n   21 Account of eyewitnesses furnished to the Baltimore _American_.\r\n\r\n_   22 Vide_ the _Times_, 17th July, 1877.\r\n\r\n   23 Berlin correspondence of the _Times_, 31st July, 1877.\r\n\r\n   24 The full official account has not yet been issued. The brief\r\n      narrative presented here is derived principally from the lively and\r\n      interesting series of letters from the pen of Lord George Campbell;\r\n      from “The Cruise of H.M.S. _Challenger_,” by W. J. J. Spry, R.N.,\r\n      one of the engineers of the vessel; and the Nautical and other\r\n      scientific and technical magazines.\r\n\r\n   25 The Austrian frigate _Novara_ made, in 1857-8-9, a voyage round “and\r\n      about” the world of 51,686 miles. As it was a sailing vessel, no\r\n      reliable results could be expected from their deep-sea soundings,\r\n      and, in fact, on the only two occasions when they attempted anything\r\n      very deep, their lines broke.\r\n\r\n   26 The “sinkers” were usually allowed at the rate of 112 lb. for each\r\n      1,000 fathoms.\r\n\r\n   27 Most of the recorded examples of earlier deep-sea soundings have\r\n      little scientific value. Unless the sounding-line sinks\r\n      perpendicularly, and the vessel remains stationary—to do which she\r\n      may have to steam against wind and tide or current—it must be\r\n      evident that the data obtained are not reliable. From a sailing\r\n      vessel it is impossible to obtain absolutely reliable soundings\r\n      except in, say, a tideless lake, unruffled by wind. It is very\r\n      evident that if the sounding line drags after or in any direction\r\n      from the vessel, the depth indicated may be greatly in excess of the\r\n      true depth; indeed, it may be double or treble in some cases. There\r\n      is one recorded example of a depth of 7,706 fathoms having been\r\n      obtained, which too evidently comes under this category. After\r\n      several years’ soundings on the part of the _Challenger_ and the\r\n      United States vessel _Tuscarora_, it has become probable that no\r\n      part of the ocean has a depth much greater than 4,500 fathoms. But\r\n      even this is upwards of five miles!\r\n\r\n   28 In their popular works on the sea, “The Ocean World,” and “The World\r\n      of the Sea.”\r\n\r\n   29 “Log Letters from the _Challenger_.”\r\n\r\n   30 All readers will remember Peter Simple, and how he tells us that “It\r\n      has been from time immemorial the heathenish custom to sacrifice the\r\n      greatest fool of the family to the prosperity and naval superiority\r\n      of the country,” and that he personally “was selected by general\r\n      acclamation!” Marryat knew very well, however, that it was “younger\r\n      sons,” and not by any means necessarily the greatest fools of the\r\n      family who went to sea.\r\n\r\n   31 William Pitt, long Master-Attendant at Jamaica Dockyard, who died at\r\n      Malta, in 1840.

Plymouth had furnished more than\r\n      one-third of the crew.\r\n\r\n   44 None of the survivors appeared to know whether the _Captain’s_ screw\r\n      was revolving at the time. Her steam was partially up. Had she\r\n      steamed, there is every probability that the catastrophe would not\r\n      have occurred.\r\n\r\n   45 One man testified that he had heard Captain Burgoyne’s inquiries as\r\n      to how much the ship was heeling over, the answers given being\r\n      respectively, “18,” “23,” “25 degrees.” The movement was never\r\n      checked, and almost the moment after she had reached 25 degrees, she\r\n      was keel-uppermost, and about to make that terrific plunge to the\r\n      bottom.\r\n\r\n   46 Mr. May’s statement at the court-martial was in part as\r\n      follows:—“Shortly after 0.15 a.m. on the 7th inst., being in my\r\n      cabin, which was on the starboard or lee side of the ship, I was\r\n      disturbed in my sleep by the noise of some marines. Feeling the ship\r\n      uneasy, I dressed myself, and took the lantern to look at the guns\r\n      in the turrets.... It was but a very short time—from fifteen to\r\n      twenty minutes—past midnight. I then went to the after-turret. The\r\n      guns were all right. Immediately I got inside the turret I felt the\r\n      ship heel steadily over, deeper and deeper, and a heavy sea struck\r\n      her on the weather-side. _The water flowed into the turret_ as I got\r\n      through the pointing-hole on the top, and I found myself overboard;\r\n      I struck out, and succeeded in reaching the steam-pinnace, which was\r\n      bottom up, on which were Captain Burgoyne and five or six others. I\r\n      saw the ship turn bottom-up, and sink stern first, the last I saw of\r\n      her being her bows. The whole time of her turning over to sinking\r\n      was but from five to ten minutes, if so much. Shortly after, I saw\r\n      the launch drifting close to us who were on the pinnace; she was but\r\n      a few yards from us; I called out, ‘Jump, men—it is your last\r\n      chance!’ I jumped, and succeeded, with three others, in reaching\r\n      her. I do not know for certain whether Captain Burgoyne jumped or\r\n      not. I was under the impression he did; but the others in the launch\r\n      do not think so. At any rate, he never reached her. When on the\r\n      pinnace, a large ship, which I believe to have been the\r\n      _Inconstant_, passed us fifty yards to leeward. We all hailed her;\r\n      but, I suppose, the howling of the wind and sea prevented their\r\n      hearing us.”\r\n\r\n   47 The late Admiral Sherard Osborn, in a letter to the _Times_, said,\r\n      “The desire of our Admiralty to make all their fighting-ships cruise\r\n      under canvas, as well as steam, induced poor Captain Coles to go a\r\n      step further, and to make a ship with a low free board a\r\n      sailing-ship.” This was against his judgment, however.\r\n\r\n   48 Admiral Milne, in his despatch dated from H.M.S. _Lord Warden_, off\r\n      Finisterre, September 7th, 1870, stated that, at a little before 1\r\n      a.m., the _Captain_ was astern of his ship, “apparently closing\r\n      under steam. The signal ‘open order’ was made, and at once answered;\r\n      and at 1.15 a.m. she was on the _Lord Warden’s_ (the flag-ship’s)\r\n      lee quarter, about six points abaft the beam. From that time until\r\n      about 1.30 a.m. I constantly watched the ship.... She was heeling\r\n      over a good deal to starboard,” &c. We have seen that she went down\r\n      shortly after the midnight watch had been called.\r\n\r\n   49 A “Narrative of the Loss of the _Royal George_,” published at\r\n      Portsea, and written by a gentleman who was on the island at the\r\n      time.\r\n\r\n   50 The exact number was never known. There were 250 women on board, a\r\n      large proportion of whom were the wives and relatives of the\r\n      sailors; and there were also a number of children, most of whom\r\n      belonged to Portsmouth. Besides these, there were a number of Jew\r\n      and other traders on board.\r\n\r\n   51 Mr. Ingram, whose narrative, printed in the little work before\r\n      quoted, bears all the impress of truth.\r\n\r\n   52 The sentence of the court-martial blamed Captain Dawkins, his\r\n      navigating-lieutenant, and the ship’s carpenter, for not\r\n      endeavouring to stop “the breach from the outside with the means at\r\n      their command, such as hammocks and sails;” for not having “ordered\r\n      Captain Hickley, of H.M.S. _Iron Duke_, to tow H.M.S. _Vanguard_\r\n      into shallow water,” such being available at a short distance; the\r\n      chief-engineer for not “applying the means at his command to relieve\r\n      the ship of water;” the navigating-lieutenant “for neglect of duty\r\n      in not pointing out to his captain that there was shoaler water\r\n      within a short distance;” and the carpenter in “not taking immediate\r\n      steps for sounding the compartments, and reporting from time to time\r\n      the progress of the water.” A lamentable showing, truly, if all\r\n      these points were neglected! So far as the commander is concerned,\r\n      his successful efforts to save the lives of all on board (not\r\n      knowing when his ship might go down, and with the remembrance of the\r\n      sudden loss of the _Captain_ full in view) speak much in his favour,\r\n      and in extenuation of much that would otherwise appear culpable\r\n      neglect.\r\n\r\n   53 Nineteen fathoms, or 114 feet. Her main-topmast-head was afterwards\r\n      twenty-four feet out of water.\r\n\r\n   54 The total estimated loss was £550,000.\r\n\r\n   55 Mr. Ward Hunt said publicly that, “If the _Iron Duke_ had sent an\r\n      enemy’s ship to the bottom, we should have called her one of the\r\n      most formidable ships of war in the world, and all that she has done\r\n      is actually what she was intended to do, _except, of course, that\r\n      the ship she struck was unfortunately our own property, and not that\r\n      of the enemy_.”\r\n\r\n   56 Mr. Reed wrote to the _Times_ to the effect that there would,\r\n      undoubtedly, be a “greater measure of safety during a naval\r\n      engagement than on ordinary occasions,” and explained that “the\r\n      ruling consideration which has been aimed at in these ships has been\r\n      so to divide them into compartments, that, when all the water-tight\r\n      doors and valves are arranged as they would be on going into action,\r\n      the breach by a ram of one compartment only should not suffice to\r\n      sink the ship.”\r\n\r\n   57 Sir Henry James, Attorney-General to the previous Government, spoke\r\n      publicly on the subject in the plainest terms. He said:—“One would\r\n      have thought that if there were a court-martial on the vessel which\r\n      is lost, the officers of the vessel which caused that loss would not\r\n      go scot free.” The Admiralty was blamed for not having sent the\r\n      decision of the Court back to it for reconsideration, instead of\r\n      which they broke a rule of naval etiquette, and seemed anxious to\r\n      quash inquiry.\r\n\r\n   58 “The loss of the _Kent_, East Indiaman,” by Lieut.-General Sir\r\n      Duncan MacGregor, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n   59 The raft is described in the original work on the shipwreck of the\r\n      _Medusa_ substantially as follows:—It was composed of topmasts,\r\n      yards, planks, the boom, &c., lashed strongly together; two topmasts\r\n      formed the sides, and four other masts, of the same length as the\r\n      former, were placed in the centre, planks being nailed on them. Long\r\n      timbers were placed across the raft, adding considerably to its\r\n      strength; these projected about ten feet on each side. There was a\r\n      rail along the sides, to keep those on board from falling into the\r\n      sea. Its height being only about a foot and a half, it was\r\n      constantly under water, though this could easily have been remedied,\r\n      by raising a second floor a foot or two above it. Two of the ship’s\r\n      yards, joined to the extremities of the sides, at one end met in\r\n      front and formed a bow. Its length was sixty feet, and breadth about\r\n      twenty.\r\n\r\n   60 Later it took with many of them still stranger forms. One M. Savigny\r\n      had the most agreeable visions; he fancied himself in a rich and\r\n      highly-cultivated country, surrounded by happy companions. Some\r\n      desired their companions not to fear, that they were going to look\r\n      for succour, and would soon return; they then plunged into the sea.\r\n      Others became furious, and rushed on their companions with drawn\r\n      swords, asking for the wing of a chicken, or some bread. Some,\r\n      thinking themselves still aboard the frigate, asked for their\r\n      hammock, that they might go below to sleep. Others imagined that\r\n      they saw ships, or a harbour, behind which was a noble city. M.\r\n      Correard believed he was in Italy, enjoying all the delights of that\r\n      beautiful country. One of the officers said to him, “I recollect\r\n      that we have been deserted by the boats, but don’t be afraid; I have\r\n      just written to the governor, and in a few hours we shall be in\r\n      safety.” These illusions did not last for any length of time, but\r\n      were constantly broken by the war of the elements, and the fitful\r\n      revolts which constantly disgraced the company.\r\n\r\n   61 The writer, during a long voyage (England to Vancouver Island, _viâ_\r\n      Cape Horn), made in 1862, saw flying-fish constantly falling on the\r\n      deck, where they remained quivering and glittering in the sunlight.\r\n      To accomplish this, they had to fly over a height of about fifteen\r\n      or sixteen feet, the top of the bulwarks, or walls of the steamship,\r\n      being at least that distance above the water.\r\n\r\n   62 Large merchant-vessels have been constructed of steel, which is\r\n      stronger than iron, weight for weight; and consequently, in building\r\n      vessels of equal strength, a less weight and thickness is required.\r\n      It is said, that if the large Atlantic steamers of 3,500 tons and\r\n      upwards were built of steel, instead of iron, their displacement in\r\n      the water would be one-sixth less, and their carrying capacity\r\n      double. A steel troop-ship, accommodating about 1,000 persons and\r\n      drawing only two feet and a quarter of water, was constructed, in\r\n      1861, for use on the Lower Indus. She was taken out in pieces and\r\n      put together in India, the total weight of the steel employed being\r\n      only 270 tons, although she was 375 feet long, with a beam of 46\r\n      feet.\r\n\r\n   63 “The Fleet of the Future: Iron or Wood,” by J.

A year before a storm cast a quantity of\r\n      drift-wood under the walls. “As fuel had long been a scarce article,\r\n      this supply was therefore considered as a miraculous interference of\r\n      Providence in our favour.” (_Vide_ Drinkwater’s “Gibraltar.”)\r\n\r\n   73 The Romans, however, sometimes employed red-hot bolts, which were\r\n      ejected from catapults.\r\n\r\n   74 Lopez de Ayala, “Historia de Gibraltar.”\r\n\r\n   75 “Memoirs of Sully,” bk. xx.\r\n\r\n   76 In a memorial presented to Philip V. after the capture, it was\r\n      stated that the garrison comprised “fewer than 300 men; a few poor\r\n      and raw peasants.” Other accounts range from 150 to 500.\r\n\r\n   77 “Journal of an Officer during the Siege.”\r\n\r\n   78 See _ante_, page 16.\r\n\r\n   79 Sayer’s “History of Gibraltar.”\r\n\r\n   80 Barrow’s “Life of Lord Howe.”\r\n\r\n_   81 Vide_ “Malta Sixty Years Ago,” by Admiral Shaw.\r\n\r\n   82 “The Crescent and the Cross.”\r\n\r\n   83 “Malta under the Phœnicians, Knights, and English,” by W.

Thomson, “The Straits of Malacca, Indo-China, and China.”\r\n\r\n  101 It is stated that an old man, named Macgregor, had long before been\r\n      in the habit of bringing once a year to Sydney small pieces of gold,\r\n      which he always sold to a jeweller there, and also that a convict\r\n      had been whipped for having lumps of gold in his possession prior to\r\n      the above. Hargreaves’ claim rests both on the actual amount\r\n      discovered, and on his publishing the fact at once.\r\n\r\n  102 “The Australian Colonies: their Origin and Present Condition.”\r\n\r\n  103 In his work “Westward by Rail,” which contains a most reliable\r\n      account of California, its history and progress.\r\n\r\n  104 At the Cariboo mines, British Columbia, in 1863, there were 7,000\r\n      men on the various creeks. There were not over a dozen women there!\r\n\r\n  105 Excepting at San Francisco, the only docks worthy of the name on the\r\n      _whole_ Pacific coasts of America are those of England’s naval\r\n      station at Esquimalt.\r\n\r\n  106 Douglas pines have been measured in British Columbia which were\r\n      _forty-eight_ feet in circumference at their base, and therefore\r\n      about sixteen feet through. These magnificent trees are only second\r\n      in size to the “Big Trees” of California.\r\n\r\n  107 On many parts of the North-west Pacific coasts of America, from\r\n      Oregon northwards to Bering Straits, the salmon, in their season,\r\n      swarm so that a boat can hardly make a way through their “schools.”\r\n\r\n_  108 Harper’s Magazine_ (New York), April, 1869.\r\n\r\n  109 “Extracts from a Journal written on the Coasts of Chili, Peru, and\r\n      Mexico, &c.”\r\n\r\n  110 “The West Indies and the Spanish Main.”\r\n\r\n  111 “At Last: A Christmas in the West Indies.”\r\n\r\n  112 “Naval Chronicles,” vol. xii.\r\n\r\n  113 Other islands of the West Indies, as St. Thomas’s, which is a kind\r\n      of leading “junction” for mail steamers, and St. Domingo—so\r\n      intimately connected with the voyages of Columbus—will be mentioned\r\n      hereafter.\r\n\r\n  114 “Lands of the Slave and the Free,” by the Hon.
