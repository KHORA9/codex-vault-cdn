C. HARE\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF “MEMORIALS OF A QUIET LIFE.”\r\n“THE STORY OF TWO NOBLE LIVES.”\r\nETC. ETC.\r\n\r\nVOLUME IV\r\n\r\nLONDON\r\nGEORGE ALLEN, 156, CHARING CROSS ROAD\r\n1900\r\n\r\n[_All rights reserved_]\r\n\r\nPrinted by BALLANTYNE, HANSON & CO.\r\nAt the Ballantyne Press\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the last two chapters, these three volumes were\r\nprinted at the same time with the first three volumes of “The Story of\r\nmy Life” in 1896, therefore many persons are spoken of in them as still\r\nliving who have since passed away, and others, mentioned as children,\r\nhave since grown up.\r\n\r\nReviews will doubtless, in general, continue to abuse the book,\r\nespecially for its great length. But personally, if I am interested in a\r\nstory, I like it to be a long one; and there is no obligation for any\r\nwho dislike a long book to read this one: they may look at a page or two\r\nhere and there, where they seem promising; or, better still, they can\r\nleave it quite alone: they really need have nothing to complain of.\r\n\r\nIn the later volumes I have used letters for my narrative even more than\r\nin the former. Many will feel with Dr. Newman that “the true life of a\r\nman is in his letters.... Not only for the interest of a biography, but\r\nfor arriving at the inside of things, the publication of letters is the\r\ntrue method. Biographers varnish, they assign motives, they conjecture\r\nfeelings, but contemporary letters are facts.”\r\n\r\nAUGUSTUS J. C.

Forward! forward!”--CARLYLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI spent the greater part of the fiercely cold winter of 1870-71 in\r\ncomplete seclusion at Holmhurst, entirely engrossed in the work of the\r\n“Memorials,” which had been the last keen interest of my Mother’s life.\r\nIn calling up the vivid image of long-ago days spent with her, I seemed\r\nto live those days over again, and I found constant proof of her loving\r\nforethought for the first months of my solitude in the materials which,\r\nwithout my knowledge, and without then the slightest idea of\r\npublication, she must have frequently devoted herself to arranging\r\nduring the last few years of her life. As each day passed, and the work\r\nunravelled itself, I was increasingly convinced of the wisdom of her\r\ndeath-bed decision that until the book was quite finished I should give\r\nit to none of the family to read. They must judge of it as a whole.\r\nOtherwise, in “attempting to please all, I should please none: shocking\r\nnobody’s prejudices I should enlist nobody’s sympathies.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this decision greatly ruffled the sensibilities of my\r\nStanley cousins, especially of Arthur Stanley and his sister Mary, who\r\nfrom the first threatened me with legal proceedings if I gave them the\r\nsmallest loop-hole for them, by publishing a word of their own mother’s\r\nwriting without their consent, which from the first, also, they declared\r\nthey would withhold. They were also “quite certain” that no one would\r\never read the “Memorials” if they were published, in which I always\r\nthought they might be wrong, as people are so apt to be when they are\r\n“quite certain.”\r\n\r\nMy other cousins did not at first approve of the plan of the\r\n“Memorials,” but when once completely convinced that it had been their\r\ndear aunt’s wish, they withdrew all opposition.\r\n\r\nStill the harshness with which I was now continually treated and spoken\r\nof by those with whom I had always hitherto lived on terms of the utmost\r\nintimacy was a bitter trial. In a time when a single great grief\r\npervades every hour, unreasonable demands, cruel words, and taunting\r\nsneers are more difficult to bear than when life is rippling on in an\r\neven course. I was by no means blameless: I wrote sharp letters: I made\r\nharsh speeches; but that it was my duty to fight in behalf of the\r\nfulfilment of the solemn duty which had devolved upon me, I never\r\ndoubted then, and I have never doubted since. In the fulfilment of that\r\nduty I was prepared to sacrifice every friend I had in the world, all\r\nthe little fortune I had, my very life itself. I felt that I must learn\r\nhenceforth to act with “Selbständigkeit,” which somehow seems to have a\r\nstronger meaning than independence; and I believe I had in mind the\r\nmaxim of Sœur Rosalie--“Faites le bien, et laissez dire.”\r\n\r\nA vivid impression that I had a very short time to live made me more\r\neager about the _rapid_ fulfilment of my task. I thought of the Spanish\r\nproverb, “By-and-by is always too late,” and I often worked at the book\r\nfor twelve hours a day. My Mother had long thought, and latterly often\r\nsaid, that it was impossible I could long survive her: that when two\r\nlives were so closely entwined as ours, one could not go on alone. She\r\nhad often even spoken of “when we die.” But God does not allow people to\r\ndie of grief, though, when sorrow has once taken possession of one, only\r\nhard work, laboriously undertaken, can--not drive it out, but keep it\r\nunder control. It is as Whittier says:--\r\n\r\n     “There is nothing better than work for mind or body. It makes the\r\n     burden of sorrow, which all sooner or later must carry, lighter. I\r\n     like the wise Chinese proverb: ‘You cannot prevent the birds of\r\n     sadness from flying over your head, but you may prevent them from\r\n     stopping to build their nests in your hair.’”[1]\r\n\r\nI had felt the _gradual_ separation of death. At first the sense of my\r\nMother’s presence was still quite vivid: then it was less so: at last\r\nthe day came when I felt “she is nowhere here now.”\r\n\r\nIt was partly owing to the strong impression in her mind that I could\r\nnot survive her that my Mother had failed to make the usual arrangements\r\nfor my future provision. As she had never allowed any money to be placed\r\nin my name, I had--being no legal relation to her--to pay a stranger’s\r\nduty of £10 per cent on all she possessed, and this amounted to a large\r\nsum, when extended to a duty on every picture, even every garden\r\nimplement, &c.[2] Not only this, but during her lifetime she had been\r\ninduced by various members of the family to sign away a large portion of\r\nher fortune, and in the intricate difficulties which arose I was assured\r\nthat I should have nothing whatever left to live upon beyond £60 a year,\r\nand the rent of Holmhurst (fortunately secured), if it could be let. I\r\nwas urged by the Stanleys to submit at once to my fate, and to sell\r\nHolmhurst; yet I could not help hoping for better days, which came with\r\nthe publication of “Walks in Rome.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, half distracted by the unsought “advice” which was poured\r\nupon me from all sides, and worn-out with the genuine distress of my\r\nold servants, I went away in March, just as far as I could, first to\r\nvisit the Pole Carews in Cornwall, and then to the Land’s End, to\r\nStephen Lawley, who was then living in a cottage by the roadside near\r\nPenzance. I was so very miserable and so miserably preoccupied at this\r\ntime, that I have no distinct recollection of these visits, beyond the\r\nimage on my mind of the grand chrysoprase seas of Cornwall and the\r\nstupendous rocks against which they beat, especially at Tol Pedn\r\nPenwith. I felt more in my natural element when, after I had gone to\r\nBournemouth to visit Archie Colquhoun,[3] who was mourning the recent\r\nloss of both his parents, I was detained there by his sudden and\r\ndangerous illness. While there, also, I was cheered by the first\r\nthoughts for a tour in Spain during the next winter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MARY LEA GIDMAN.\r\n\r\n“_Penzance, March 13, 1871._--I know how much and sadly you will have\r\nthought to-day of the last terrible 13th of March, when we were awakened\r\nin the night by the dear Mother’s paralytic seizure, and saw her so\r\nsadly changed. In all the anguish of looking back upon that time, and\r\nthe feeling which I constantly have now of all that is bright and happy\r\nhaving perished out of my life with her sweet presence, I have much\r\ncomfort in thinking that we were able to carry out her last great wish\r\nin bringing her home, and in the memory of the three happy months of\r\ncomparative health which she afterwards enjoyed there. Many people since\r\nI left home have read some of the ‘Memorials’ I am writing, and express\r\na sense of never having known before how perfectly beautiful her\r\ncharacter was, and that in truth, like Abraham, they ‘entertained an\r\nangel unawares.’ Now that dear life, which always seemed to us so\r\nperfect, has indeed become perfected, and the heavenly glow which came\r\nto the revered features in death is but a very faint image of the\r\nheavenly glory which always rests upon them.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n“_Stewart’s Hotel, Bournemouth, March 30, 1871._--The discussion of a\r\ntour in Spain comes to me as the pleasant dream of a possible future....\r\nIt is of course easy for us to see Spain _in a way_ in a few weeks, but\r\nif one does not go in a cockney spirit, but really wishing to _learn_,\r\nto open one’s eyes to the glorious past of Spain, the story of Isabella,\r\nthe Moorish dominion, the boundless wealth of its legends, its proverbs,\r\nits poetry--all that makes it different from any other country--we must\r\nbegin in a different way, and our chief interest will be found in the\r\ngrand old cities which the English generally do _not_ visit--Leon,\r\nZaragoza, Salamanca; in the wonderful romance which clings around the\r\nrocks of Monserrat and the cloisters of Santiago; in the scenes of the\r\nCid, Don Roderick, Cervantes, &c.\r\n\r\n“You will be sorry to hear that I am again in my normal condition of day\r\nand night nurse, in all the varying anxieties of a sick-room. I came\r\nhere ten days ago to stay with Archie Colquhoun, whom I had known very\r\nlittle before, but who, having lost both father and mother lately,\r\nturned in heart to me and begged me to come to him. On Tuesday he fell\r\nwith a great crash on the floor in a fit, and was unconscious for many\r\nhours.... It was a narrow escape of his life, and he was in a most\r\ncritical state till the next day, but now he is doing well, though it\r\nwill long be an anxious case.[4] You will easily understand how much\r\npast anguish has come back to me in the night-watches here, and I feel\r\nit odd that these duties should, as it were, be perpetually _found_ for\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn May I paid the first of many visits to my dear Lady Waterford at\r\nHighcliffe, her fairy palace by the sea, on the Hampshire coast, near\r\nChrist Church, and though I was still too sad to enter into the full\r\ncharm of the place and the life, which I have enjoyed so much since, I\r\nwas greatly refreshed by the mental tonic, and by the kindness and\r\nsympathy which I have never failed to receive from Lady Waterford and\r\nher friend Lady Jane Ellice. With them, too, I was able to discuss my\r\nwork in all its aspects, and greatly was I encouraged by all they said.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIGHCLIFFE, THE KING’S ORIEL.][5]\r\n\r\nFor many years after this, Highcliffe was more familiar to me than any\r\nother place except my own home, and I am attached to every stone of it.\r\nThe house was the old Mayor’s house of Les Andelys, removed from\r\nNormandy by Lord Stuart de Rothesay, but a drawing shows the building as\r\nit was in France, producing a far finer effect than as it was put up in\r\nEngland by Pugin, the really fine parts, especially the great window,\r\nbeing lower down in the building, and more made of. In the room to which\r\nthat window belonged, Antoyne de Bourbon, King of Navarre, died. The\r\nportraits in the present room of the Duchess of Suffolk and her second\r\nhusband, who was a Bertie, have the old ballad of “The Duchess of\r\nSuffolk” inscribed beneath. They fled abroad, and their son Peregrine,\r\nborn in a church porch, was the progenitor of the present Berties. I\r\nhave myself always inhabited the same room at Highcliffe--one up a\r\nseparate stair of its own, adorned with great views of the old\r\nHighcliffe and Mount Stuart, and with old French furniture, including a\r\nchair worked in blue and red by Queen Marie Amélie and Madame Adelaïde.\r\nThe original house of Highcliffe was built on land sold to Lord Stuart\r\nby a Mr. Penlees, who had had a legacy of bank-notes left him in the\r\ncase of a cocked-hat--it was quite full of them. Mr. Penlees had built a\r\nvery ugly house, the present “old rooms,” which Lord Stuart cased over.\r\nThen he said that, while Lady Stuart was away, he would add a few rooms.\r\nWhen she came back, to her intense consternation, she found the new\r\npalace of Highcliffe: all the ornaments, windows, &c., from Les Andelys\r\nhaving been landed close by upon the coast. I always liked going with\r\nLady Waterford into the old rooms, which were those principally used by\r\nLady Stuart, and contained a wonderful copy of Sir Joshua which Lady\r\nWaterford made when she was ten years old. There was also a beautiful\r\ncopy of the famous picture of Lord Royston, done by Lady Waterford\r\nherself long ago; a fine drawing of the leave-taking of Charles I. and\r\nhis children--Charles with a head like the representations of the\r\nSaviour; and a portrait of the old Lady Stuart, “Grannie Stuart,” with\r\nall the wrinkles smoothed out. “Oh, if I am like that, I am only fit to\r\ndie,” she said, when she saw it.[6]\r\n\r\nI have put down a few notes from the conversation at Highcliffe this\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Mr. M. was remonstrated with because he would not admire Louis\r\nPhilippe’s régime. He said, ‘No, I cannot; I have known him before so\r\nwell. I am like the peasant who, when he was remonstrated with because\r\nhe would not take off his hat to a new wooden cross that was put up,\r\nsaid he couldn’t _parceque je l’ai connu poirier_.’”\r\n\r\n“Some one spoke to old Lady Salisbury[7] of Adam’s words--‘The woman\r\ntempted me, and I did eat.’ ‘Shabby fellow,’ she said.”\r\n\r\n“Lady Anne Barnard[8] was at a party in France, and her carriage never\r\ncame to take her away. A certain Duke who was there begged to have the\r\nhonour of taking her home, and she accepted, but on the way felt rather\r\nawkward and thought he was too affectionate and gallant. Suddenly she\r\nwas horrified to see the Duke on his knees at the bottom of the\r\ncarriage, and was putting out her hands and warding him off, when he\r\nexclaimed, ‘Taisez-vous, Madame, voilà le bon Dieu qui passe.’ It was a\r\ngreat blow to her vanity.”\r\n\r\n“Old Lord Malmesbury[9] used to invent the most extraordinary stories\r\nand tell them so well; indeed, he told them till he quite believed them.\r\nOne was called ‘The Bloody Butler,’ and was about a butler who drank the\r\nwine and then filled the bottles with the blood of his victims. Another\r\nwas called ‘The Moth-eaten Clergyman;’ it was about a very poor\r\nclergyman, a Roman he was, who had some small parish in Southern\r\nGermany, and was a very good man, quite excellent, absolutely devoted to\r\nthe good of his people. There was, however, one thing which militated\r\nagainst his having all the influence amongst his flock which he ought\r\nto have had, and this was that he was constantly observed to steal out\r\nof his house in the late evening with two bags in his hand, and to bury\r\nthe contents in the garden; and yet when people came afterwards by\r\nstealth and dug for the treasure, they found nothing at all, and this\r\nwas thought, well ... not quite canny.\r\n\r\n“Now the diocesan of that poor clergyman, who happened to be the\r\nArchbishop of Mayence, was much distressed at this, that the influence\r\nof so good a man should thus be marred. Soon afterwards he went on his\r\nvisitation tour, and he stopped at the clergyman’s house for the night.\r\nHe arrived with outriders, and two postillions, and four fat horses, and\r\nfour fat pug-dogs, which was not very convenient. However, the poor\r\nclergyman received them all very hospitably, and did the best he could\r\nfor them. But the Archbishop thought it was a great opportunity for\r\nputting an end to all the rumours that were about, and with a view to\r\nthis he gave orders that the doors should be fastened and locked, so\r\nthat no one should go out.\r\n\r\n“When morning came, the windows of the priest’s house were not opened,\r\nand no one emerged, and at last the parishioners became alarmed, for\r\nthere was no sound at all. But when they broke open the doors, volleys\r\nupon volleys of moths of every kind and hue poured out; but of the poor\r\nclergyman, or of the Archbishop of Mayence, or of the outriders and\r\npostillions, or of the four fat horses, or of the four pug-dogs, came\r\nout nothing at all, for they were all eaten up. For the fact was that\r\nthe poor clergyman really had the most dreadful disease which bred\r\nmyriads of moths; if he could bury their eggs at night, he kept them\r\nunder, but when he was locked up, and he could do nothing, they were too\r\nmuch for him. Now there is a moral in this story, because if the people\r\nand the Archbishop had looked to the fruits of that excellent man’s\r\nlife, and not attended to foolish reports with which they had no concern\r\nwhatever, these things would never have happened.\r\n\r\n“These were the sort of things Lord Malmesbury used to invent. Canning\r\nused to tell them to us.”\r\n\r\n“I call the three kinds of Churchism--Attitudinarian, Latitudinarian,\r\nand Platitudinarian.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, June 12, 1871._--In a few days’ solitude what a quantity of\r\nwork I have gone through; and work which carries one back over a wide\r\nextent of the far long-ago always stretches out the hours, but how\r\ninteresting it makes them! I quite feel that I should not have lived\r\nthrough the first year of my desolation without the companionship of\r\nthis work of the ‘Memorials,’ which my darling so wisely foresaw and\r\nprepared for me. Daily I miss her more. Now that the flowers are\r\nblooming around, and the sun shining on the lawn, and the leaves out on\r\nthe ash-tree in the shade of which she used to sit, it seems impossible\r\nnot to think that the suffering present must be a dream and that she is\r\nonly ‘not yet come out;’ and what the empty room, the unused pillow are,\r\nwhence the sunshine of my life came, I cannot say. On Thursday I am\r\ngoing for one day to Hurstmonceaux, to our sacred spot. The cross is to\r\nbe put up then. It is very beautiful, and is only inscribed:--\r\n\r\nMARIA HARE,\r\nNov. 22, 1798. Nov. 13, 1870.\r\nUntil the Daybreak.\r\n\r\nNo other words are needed there; all the rest is written in the hearts\r\nof the people who loved her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHURCHYARD AT HURSTMONCEAUX.]\r\n\r\n“I have been thinking lately how all my life hitherto has been down a\r\nhighway. There was no doubt as to where the duties were; there could be\r\nno doubt whence the pleasures, certainly whence the sorrows would come.\r\nNow there seem endless byways to diverge upon. But all the interest of\r\nlife must be on its highway: the byways may be beautiful and attractive,\r\nbut never interesting.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sept. 26._--I much enjoyed my Peakirk visit to charming people (Mr.\r\nand Mrs. James) and a curious place--an oasis in the Fens, the home of\r\nSt. Pega (sister of St. Guthlac), whose hermitage with its battered but\r\nbeautiful cross still remains. I saw Burleigh, like a Genoese palace\r\ninside; and yesterday made a fatiguing but worth while pilgrimage, for\r\nlove of Mary Queen of Scots, to Fotheringhay. One stone, but only one,\r\nremains of the castle which was the scene of her sufferings; so people\r\nwondered at my going so far. ‘Why cannot you let bygones be bygones?’\r\nsaid young W. to me. However, the church is very curious, and contains\r\ninscriptions to a whole party of Plantagenets--Richard, Earl of\r\nCornwall; Cicely, Duchess of York; Edward, father of Edward IV.--for\r\nFotheringhay, now a hamlet in the fen, was once an important place: the\r\ndeath of Mary wrought the curse which became its ruin.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have said little for many years of the George Sheffield who was the\r\ndearest friend of my boyhood. He had been attaché at Munich, Washington,\r\nConstantinople, and was now at Paris as secretary to Lord Lyons. In this\r\nmy first desolate year he also had a sorrow, which wonderfully reunited\r\nus, and we became perhaps greater friends than we had been before.\r\nAnother of whom I saw much at this time was Charlie Dalison. A younger\r\nson of a Kentish squire of good family, he went--like the young men of\r\nolden time--to London to seek his fortunes, and simply by his good\r\nlooks, winning manners, and incomparable self-reliance became the most\r\npopular young man in party-giving London society; but he had many higher\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nI needed all the support my friends could give me, for the family feud\r\nabout the “Memorials” was not the only trouble that pressed upon me at\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that, in my sister’s death-bed will, she had\r\nbequeathed to me her claims to a portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds. It was\r\nthe very fact of this bequest which in 1871 made my poor Aunt Eleanor\r\n(Miss Paul) set up a counter-claim to the picture, which was valued at\r\n_£_2000.\r\n\r\nFive-and-twenty years before, the picture had been entrusted for a time\r\nto Sir John Paul, who unfortunately, from some small vanity, allowed it\r\nto be exhibited in his own name instead of that of the owner. But I\r\nnever remember the time when it was not at Hurstmonceaux after 1845,\r\nwhen it was sent there. Sir Joshua Reynolds, who was an intimate family\r\nfriend, painted it in the house of Bishop Shipley, when my father was\r\ntwo and a half years old. It was painted for my great-aunt Lady Jones,\r\nwidow of the famous Orientalist. Lady Jones adopted her nephew Augustus\r\nHare, and brought him up as her own son, but, as she died intestate, her\r\npersonalty passed, not to him, but to her only surviving sister, Louisa\r\nShipley. Miss Shipley lived many years, and bequeathed the portrait to\r\nher youngest nephew, Marcus Hare. But Marcus gave up his legacy to my\r\nUncle Julius, who always possessed the picture in my boyhood, when it\r\nhung over the dining-room chimney-piece at Hurstmonceaux Rectory. Uncle\r\nJulius bequeathed the portrait, with all else he possessed, to his\r\nwidow, who transferred the picture at once to my adopted mother, as\r\nbeing the widow of the adopted son of Lady Jones.\r\n\r\nThe claim of the opposite party to the picture was that Mrs. Hare\r\n(“Italima”) had said that Lady Jones in her lifetime had promised to\r\ngive her the picture, a promise which was never fulfilled; and that my\r\nsister, after her mother’s death, had said at Holmhurst, “If every one\r\nhad their rights, that picture would belong to me, as my mother’s\r\nrepresentative, for Lady Jones promised it to my mother,” also that she\r\nproved her belief in having a claim to it by bequeathing that claim to\r\nme. But the strongest point against us was that somehow or other, _how_\r\nno one could explain, the picture had been allowed to remain for more\r\nthan a year in the hands of Sir John Paul, and he had exhibited it.\r\nThough the impending trial about the picture question was very different\r\nfrom that at Guildford, the violent animosity displayed by my poor aunt\r\nmade it most painful, in addition to the knowledge that she (who had\r\ninherited everything belonging to my father, mother, and sister, and had\r\ndispersed their property to the four winds of heaven, whilst I possessed\r\n_nothing_ which had belonged to them) was now trying to seize property\r\nto which she could have no possible moral right, though English law is\r\nso uncertain that one never felt sure to the last whether the fact of\r\nthe picture having been exhibited in Sir John Paul’s name might not\r\nweigh fatally with both judge and jury.\r\n\r\nFor the whole month of November I was in London, expecting the trial\r\nevery day, but it was not till the evening of the 6th of December that I\r\nheard that it was to be the next morning in the law-court off\r\nWestminster Hall. The court was crowded. My counsel, Mr. Pollock, began\r\nhis speech with a tremendous exordium. “Gentlemen of the jury, in a\r\nneighbouring court the world is sitting silent before the stupendous\r\nexcitement of the Tichborne trial: gentlemen of the jury, _that_ case\r\npales into insignificance--pales into the most _utter_ insignificance\r\nbefore the thrilling interest of the present occasion. On the narrow\r\nstage of this domestic drama, all the historic characters of the last\r\ncentury and all the literary personages of the present seem to be\r\nmarching in a solemn procession.” And he proceeded to tell the really\r\nromantic history of the picture--how Benjamin Franklin saw it painted,\r\n&c. I was called into the witness-box and examined and cross-examined\r\nfor an hour by Mr. H. James. As long as I was in the region of my\r\ngreat-uncles and aunts, I was perfectly at home, and nothing in the\r\ncross-examination could the least confuse me. Then the counsel for the\r\nopposition said, “Mr. Hare, on the 20th of April 1866 you wrote a\r\nletter, &c.: what was in that letter?” Of course I said I could not\r\ntell. “What do you think was in that letter?” So I said something, and\r\nof course it was exactly opposite to the fact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Francis George Hare_\r\n\r\n(Photogravure)]\r\n\r\nAs witnesses to the fact of the picture having been at the Rectory at\r\nthe time of the marriage of my Uncle Julius, I had subpœnaed the\r\nwhole surviving family of Mrs. Julius Hare, who could witness to it\r\nbetter than any one else, as they had half-lived at Hurstmonceaux\r\nRectory after their sister’s marriage. Her two sisters, Mrs. Powell and\r\nMrs. Plumptre, took to their beds, and remained there for a week to\r\navoid the trial, but Dr. Plumptre[10] and Mr. (F. D.) Maurice had to\r\nappear, and gave evidence as to the picture having been at Hurstmonceaux\r\nRectory at the time of their sister’s marriage in 1845,[11] and having\r\nremained there afterwards during the whole of Julius Hare’s life. Mr.\r\nGeorge Paul was then called, and took an oath that, till he went to\r\nAmerica in 1852, the picture had remained at Sir John Paul’s; but such\r\nis the inattention and ignorance of their business which I have always\r\nobserved in lawyers, that this discrepancy passed absolutely unnoticed.\r\n\r\nThe trial continued for several hours, yet when the court adjourned for\r\nluncheon I believed all was going well. It was a terrible moment when\r\nafterwards Judge Mellor summed up dead against us. Being ignorant,\r\nduring my mother’s lifetime, of the clause in Miss Shipley’s will\r\nleaving the picture to Marcus Hare, and being anxious to ward off from\r\nher the agitation of a lawsuit in her feeble health, I had made\r\nadmissions which I had really previously forgotten, but which were most\r\ndangerous, as to the difficulty which I then felt in establishing our\r\nclaim to the picture. These weighed with Judge Mellor, and, if the jury\r\nhad followed his lead, our cause would have been ruined. The jury\r\ndemanded to retire, and were absent for some time. Miss Paul, who was in\r\nthe area of the court, received the congratulations of all her friends,\r\nand I was so certain that my case was lost, that I went to the solicitor\r\nof Miss Paul and said that I had had the picture brought to Sir John\r\nLefevre’s house in Spring Gardens, and that I wished to give it up as\r\nsoon as ever the verdict was declared, as if any injury happened to it\r\nafterwards, a claim might be made against me for £2000.\r\n\r\nThen the jury came back and gave a verdict for ... the defendant!\r\n\r\nIt took everybody by surprise, and it was the most triumphant moment I\r\never remember. All the Pauls sank down as if they were shot. My friends\r\nflocked round me with congratulations.\r\n\r\nThe trial took the whole day, the court sitting longer than usual on\r\naccount of it. The enemy immediately applied for a new trial, which\r\ncaused us much anxiety, but this time I was not required to appear in\r\nperson. The second trial took place on the 16th of January 1872, before\r\nthe Lord Chief Justice, Judge Blackburn, Judge Mellor, and Judge Hannen,\r\nand, after a long discussion, was given triumphantly in my favour, Judge\r\nMellor withdrawing his speech made at the former trial, and stating\r\nthat, after reconsideration of all the facts, he rejoiced at the\r\ndecision of the jury.\r\n\r\nAs both trials were gained by me, the enemy had nominally to pay all the\r\ncosts, but still the expenses were most heavy. It was just at the time\r\nwhen I was poorest, when my adopted mother’s will was still in abeyance.\r\nThere were also other aspirants for the picture, in the shape of the\r\ncreditors of my brother Francis, who claimed as representing my father\r\n(not my mother). It was therefore thought wiser by all that I should\r\nassent to the portrait being sold, and be content to retain only in its\r\nplace a beautiful copy which had been made for me by the kindness of my\r\ncousin Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre. The portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds was\r\nsold at Christie’s in the summer of 1872 for £2200, and is now in the\r\nNational Gallery of America at New York.\r\n\r\nA week after the trial, on the 13th of December, I left England for\r\nSpain. It had at first been intended that a party of five should pass\r\nthe winter there together, but one after another fell off, till none\r\nremained except Miss Wright--“Aunt Sophy”--who joined me in Paris. The\r\nstory of our Spanish tour is fully told in my book “Wanderings in\r\nSpain,” which appeared first as articles in _Good Words_. These were\r\neasily written and pleasant and amusing to write, but have none of the\r\nreal value of the articles which I afterwards contributed on “Days near\r\nRome.” I will only give here, to carry on the story, some extracts from\r\nmy letters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Paris, Dec. 14, 1871._--How different France and England! At Holmhurst\r\nI left a green garden bright with chrysanthemums and everlastings: here,\r\na pathless waste of snow up to the tops of the hedges became so deep\r\nnear Creil that, as day broke, we remained fixed for an hour and a half\r\nin the midst of a forest, neither able to move backwards or forwards.\r\nAnd by the side of the rail were remains of a frightful accident of\r\nyesterday--engine smashed to bits, carriages cut in half, the linings\r\nhanging in rags, cushions lying about, &c. The guard was not\r\nencouraging--‘Oui, il y avait des victimes, pas beaucoup, mais il y a\r\ntoujours des victimes.’ ... The state of Paris is unspeakably wretched,\r\nhillocks of snow, uncarted away and as high as your shoulder, filling\r\nthe sides of the streets, with a pond in the intervening space. The\r\nTuileries (after the Commune) looks far worse than I\r\nexpected--restorable, but for the present it has lost all its form and\r\ncharacter. We went inside this morning, but were soon warned out on\r\naccount of the falling walls weakened by the frost.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Pau, Dec. 20_.--I was glad to seize the opportunity of Aunt Sophy’s\r\nwishing for a few days’ rest before encountering Spain to pay a visit to\r\nthe Taylors.[12] ... This morning I have walked on the terrace of the\r\npark, and lived over again many of those suffering scenes when we were\r\nhere before. Truly _here_ I have no feeling but one of thankfulness for\r\nthe Mother’s release from the suffering body which was so great a burden\r\nto her. I went to the Hotel Victoria, and looked up at the windows of\r\nthe rooms where, for the first time, we passed together through the\r\nvalley of the Shadow of Death.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MARY LEA GIDMAN,\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 2._--You will imagine how the long-ago came back to me at\r\nPau--the terrible time when we were hourly expecting the blow which has\r\nnow fallen, and which we both, I know, feel daily and hourly. But I\r\nthink it was in mercy that God spared us then: we were better prepared\r\nfor our great desolation when it really came, and in the years for which\r\nour beloved one was given back to us, she was not only our most precious\r\ncomfort and blessing, for her also they were filled with comfort, in\r\nspite of sickness, by the love with which she was ever surrounded. When\r\nI think of what the great blank is, life seems quite too desolate; but\r\nwhen I think of her _now_, and how her earthly life must have been one\r\nof increasing infirmity, instead of the perfected state from which I\r\nbelieve she can still look down upon us, I am satisfied.\r\n\r\n“Do you still keep flowers or something green in her room? I hope so.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Convent of Montserrat, in Catalonia, Jan. 4, 1872._--At the best of\r\ntimes you would never have been able to travel in Spain, for great as is\r\nthe delight of this unspeakably glorious place, I must confess we paid\r\ndear for it in the sufferings of the way. The first day introduced us to\r\nplenty of small hardships, as, a train being taken off _al improviso_,\r\nwe had to wade through muddy lanes--and the Navarre mud is _such_\r\nmud--in pitch darkness, to a wretched hovel, where we passed the night\r\nwith a number of others, in fierce cold, no fires or comforts of any\r\nkind. From thence (Alasua) we got on to Pamplona, our first picturesque\r\nSpanish town, where we spent part of Christmas Day, and then went on to\r\nTudela, where we had another wretched posada; no fires; milk, coffee,\r\nand butter quite unknown, and the meat stewed in oil and garlic; and\r\nthis has been the case everywhere except here, with other and worse\r\nin-_conveniences_.\r\n\r\n“At Zaragoza we were first a little repaid by the wonderful beauty of\r\nthe Moorish architecture--like lace in brick and stone, and the people\r\nas well as the place made a new world for us; but oh! the cold!--blocks\r\nof ice in the streets and the fiercest of winds raging.... No words\r\ncertainly can describe the awful, the hideous ugliness of the railway\r\nthe whole way here: not a tree, not a blade of grass to be seen, but\r\nceaseless wind-stricken swamps of brown mud--featureless, hopeless,\r\nutterly uncultivated. However, Manresa is glorious, a sort of mixture of\r\nTivoli (without the waterfall) and Subiaco, and thence we first gazed\r\nupon the magnificent Monserrat.\r\n\r\n“We have been four days in the convent. I never saw anything anywhere so\r\nbeautiful or so astonishing as this place, where we are miles and miles\r\nabove every living thing except the monks, amid the most stupendous\r\nprecipices of 3000 feet perpendicular, and yet in such a wealth of\r\nloveliness in arbutus, box, lentisc, smilax, and jessamine, as you can\r\nscarcely imagine. Though it is so high, and we have no fires or even\r\n_brasieros_, we scarcely feel the cold, the air is so still and the\r\nsituation so sheltered, and on the sunlit terraces, which overlook the\r\nwhole of Catalonia like a map, it is really too hot. The monks give us\r\nlodging and we have excellent food at a _fonda_ within the convent\r\nwalls, and are quite comfortable, though it must be confessed that my\r\nroom is so narrow a cell, that when I go in it is impossible to turn\r\nround, and I have to hoist myself on the little bed sideways.\r\n\r\n“It has been a strange beginning of the New Year. We breakfast at eight,\r\nand all day draw or follow the inexhaustibly lovely paths along the\r\nedges of the precipices. Yesterday we ascended the highest peak of the\r\nrange, and were away nine hours--Aunt Sophy, the maid, and I; and\r\nnothing can describe the sublimity of the views across so glorious a\r\nforeground, to the whole snowy Pyrenean ranges and the expanse of blue\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n“I act regular courier, and do all the work at inns, stations, &c., and\r\nMiss Wright is very easy to do for, and though very _piano_ in\r\nmisfortunes, is most kind and unselfish. The small stock of Spanish\r\nwhich I acquired in lonely evenings at Holmhurst enables me to get on\r\nquite easily--in fact, we never have a difficulty; and the kindness,\r\ncivility, and helpfulness of the Spanish people compensates for all\r\nother annoyances. No one cheats, nor does it seem to occur to them. All\r\nprices are fixed, and so reasonable that my week’s expenses have been\r\nless than I paid for two dismal rooms and breakfast only in Half-Moon\r\nStreet.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Barcelona, Jan. 9_.--We arrived here on the evening of the Befana--a\r\npicturesque sight. It was coming into perfect summer, people out walking\r\nin the beautiful Rambla till past 12 P.M., ladies without bonnets and\r\nshawls. It is a very interesting place, full of lovely architecture,\r\nwith palms, huge orange-trees, and terraces, and such a deep blue sea.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MARY LEA GIDMAN.\r\n\r\n“_Barcelona, Jan. 17._--We have good rooms now, but everywhere the food\r\nis shocking. At the _table-d’hôte_ one of the favourite dishes is\r\nsnail-soup, and as the snails are cooked in their shells, it does not\r\nlook very tempting. If the food were improved, this coast would be\r\nbetter for invalids in winter than the Riviera, as it is such a splendid\r\nclimate--almost too dry, as it scarcely ever rains for more than fifty\r\ndays out of the 365. The late Queen ordered every tree in the whole of\r\nSpain which did not bear fruit to be cut down, so the whole country is\r\nquite bare, and so parched and rocky that often for fifty miles you do\r\nnot see a shrub, but in some places there are palms, olives, oranges,\r\nand caroubas.\r\n\r\n“We are very thankful for the tea which Miss Wright’s maid makes for us\r\nin a saucepan.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Tarragona, Jan. 19._--We delighted in Barcelona, and wondered it did\r\nnot bring people to this coast instead of to the south of France.... We\r\nget on famously with the Spaniards. I talk as much as I can, and if I\r\ncannot, smile and look pleased, and everybody seems devoted to us, and\r\nwe are made much of and helped wherever we go. It is quite different\r\nfrom Italy: and we are learning _such_ good manners from the incessant\r\nbowing and complimenting which is required.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Cordova, Feb. 6._--We broke the dreadful journey from Valencia to\r\nAlicante by sleeping at Xativa, a lovely city of palms and rushing\r\nfountains with a mountain background, but the inn so disgusting we could\r\nnot stay. Alicante, on the other hand, had no attraction except its\r\nexcellent hotel, with dry sheets, bearable smells, no garlic, and\r\nbutter. The whole district is burnt, tawny, and desolate beyond\r\nwords--houses, walls, and castle alike dust-colour, but the climate is\r\ndelicious, and a long palm avenue fringes the sea, with scarlet\r\ngeraniums in flower. With Elche we were perfectly enraptured--the\r\nforests of palms quite glorious, many sixty feet high and laden with\r\ngolden dates; the whole place so Moorish, and the people with perfectly\r\nOriental hospitality and manners. We spent four days there, and were out\r\ndrawing from eight in the morning to five in the afternoon; _such_\r\nsubjects--but I lamented not being able to draw the wonderful\r\nfigures--copper-coloured with long black hair; the men in blue velvet,\r\nwith _mantas_ of crimson and gold and large black sombreros.\r\n\r\n“It was twenty-three hours’ journey here, and no possible stopping-place\r\nor buffet. But as for Miss Wright, she never seems the worse for\r\nanything, and is always equally kind and amiable. She is, however, very\r\n_piano_ in spirits, so that I should be thankful for a little pleasant\r\nsociety for her, as it must have been fearfully dull having no one but\r\nme for so long.\r\n\r\n“We were disappointed with Murcia, though its figures reach a climax of\r\ngrotesque magnificence, every plough-boy in the colours of Solomon’s\r\ntemple. But though we had expected to find Cordova only very\r\ninteresting, it is also most beautiful--the immense court before the\r\nmosque filled with fountains and old orange-trees laden with fruit, and\r\nthe mosque itself, with its forest of pillars, as solemn as it is\r\npicturesque.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MARY LEA GIDMAN.\r\n\r\n“_Seville, Feb. 10._--The dirt and discomfort of the railway journey to\r\nCordova was quite indescribable, but the mosque is glorious. It is so\r\nlarge that you would certainly lose your way in it, as it has more than\r\na thousand pillars, and twenty-nine different aisles of immense length,\r\nall just like one another. We made a large drawing in the court with its\r\ngrove of oranges, cypresses, and palms, and you would have been quite\r\naghast at the horrible beggars who crowded round us--people with two\r\nfingers and people with none; people with no legs and people with no\r\nnoses, or people with their eyes and mouths quite in the wrong place.\r\n\r\n“The present King (Amadeo) is much disliked and not likely to reign\r\nlong. Here at Seville, in the Carnival, they made a little image of him,\r\nwhich bowed and nodded its head, as kings do, when it was carried\r\nthrough the street, and all the great people went out to meet it and\r\nbring it into the town in mockery; and yesterday it was strangled like a\r\ncommon criminal on a scaffold in the public square; and to-day tens of\r\nthousands of people are come into the town to attend its funeral.\r\n\r\n“The Duchesse de Montpensier, who lives here, does a great deal of good,\r\nbut she is very superstitious, and, when her daughter was ill, she\r\nwalked barefoot through all the streets of Seville: the child died\r\nnotwithstanding. She and all the great ladies of Seville wear low\r\ndresses and flowers in their hair when they are out walking on the\r\npromenade, but at large evening parties they wear high dresses, which\r\nis rather contrary to English fashions. Miss Wright’s bonnet made her so\r\nstared at and followed about, that now she, and her maid also, have been\r\nobliged to get mantillas to wear on their heads instead, which does much\r\nbetter, and prevents their attracting any attention. No ladies ever\r\nthink of wearing anything but black, and gentlemen are expected to wear\r\nit too if they pay a visit.\r\n\r\n“I often feel as if I must be in another state of existence from my old\r\nlife of so many years of wandering with the sweet Mother and you, but\r\n_that_ life is always present to me as the reality--this as a dream.\r\nThere is one walk here which the dear Mother would have enjoyed and\r\nwhich always recalls her--a broad sunny terrace by the river-side edged\r\nwith marble, which ends after a time in a wild path, where pileworts are\r\ncoming into bloom under the willows. I always wonder _how_ much she\r\nknows of us now; but if she can be invisibly present, I am sure it is\r\nmostly with me, and then with you, and in her own room at Holmhurst,\r\nwhence the holy prayers and thoughts of so many years of faith and love\r\nascended.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Seville, Feb. 13._--Ever since we entered Andalusia it has poured in\r\ntorrents, but even in fine weather I think we must have been\r\ndisappointed with Seville. With such a grand cathedral interior and such\r\nbeautiful pictures, it seems hard to complain, but there never was\r\nanything less picturesque than the narrow streets of whitewashed houses,\r\nuglier than the exterior of the cathedral, or duller than the\r\nsurrounding country. Being Carnival, the streets are full of masks, many\r\nof them not very civil to the clergy--the Pope being led along by a\r\ndevil with a long tail, &c. Every one speaks of the Italian King\r\n(Amadeo) as thoroughly despised and disliked, and his reign (in spite of\r\nthe tirades in his favour in English newspapers) must now be limited to\r\nweeks; then it must be either a Republic, Montpensier, or Alfonso. Here,\r\nwhere they live, the Montpensiers are very popular, and they do an\r\nimmense deal of good amongst the poor, the institutions, and in\r\nencouraging art. Their palace of San Telmo is beautiful, with a great\r\npalm-garden. When we first came, we actually engaged lodgings in the\r\nAlcazar, the great palace of the Moorish kings, but, partly from the\r\nmosquitoes and partly from the ghosts, soon gave them up again.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Algeciras, Feb. 25._--Though we constantly asked one another what\r\npeople admired so much in Seville, its sights took us just a fortnight.\r\nOur pleasantest afternoon was spent in a drive to the Roman ruins in\r\nItalica, and we took Miss Butcher with us, who devotes her life to\r\nteaching the children in the Protestant school, for which she gets well\r\ndenounced from the same cathedral pulpit whence the _autos-da-fé_ were\r\nproclaimed, in which 34,611 people were burnt alive in Seville alone!\r\n\r\n“What a dull place Cadiz is. Nothing to make a feature but the general\r\ndistant effect of the dazzling white lines of houses rising above a\r\nsapphire sea. We had a twelve hours’ voyage to Gibraltar. I was very\r\nmiserable at first, but revived in time to sketch Trafalgar and to make\r\ntwo views in Africa as we coasted along. At last Gibraltar rose out of\r\nthe sea like an island, and very fine it is, far more so than I\r\nexpected, though we have not seen the precipice side of the rock yet. As\r\nwe turned into the bay of Algeciras, numbers of little boats put out to\r\ntake us on shore, and we are so enchanted with this place that we shall\r\nremain a few days in the primitive hotel. Our sitting-room opens by\r\nlarge glass doors on a balcony. Close below is the pretty beach with its\r\ngroups of brilliant figures--Moors in white burnooses, sailors, peasants\r\nin sombreros and _fajas_. Across the blue bay, calm as glass, with white\r\nsails flitting over it, rises the grand mass of the Rock, with the town\r\nof Gibraltar at its foot. All around are endless little walks along the\r\nshore and cliffs, through labyrinths of palmito and prickly pear, or\r\ninto the wild green moorlands which rise immediately behind, and beyond\r\nwhich is a purple chain of mountains. It is the only place I have yet\r\nseen in Spain which I think the dear Mother would have cared to stay\r\nlong at, and I can almost fancy I see her walking up the little paths\r\nwhich she would have so delighted in, or sitting on her camp-stool\r\namongst the rocks.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIBRALTAR FROM ALGECIRAS]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Gibraltar, March 2._--It was strange, when we crossed from Algeciras,\r\nto come suddenly in among an English-talking, pipe-smoking,\r\nbeer-drinking community in this swarming place, where 5000 soldiers\r\nare quartered in addition to the crowded English and Spanish population.\r\nThe main street of the town might be a slice cut out of the ugliest part\r\nof Dover, if it were not for the numbers of Moors stalking about in\r\nturbans, yellow slippers, and blue or white burnooses. Between the town\r\nand Europa Point, at the African end of the promontory, is the beautiful\r\nAlameda, walks winding through a mass of geraniums, coronillas, ixias,\r\nand aloes, all in gorgeous flower: for already the heat is most intense,\r\nand the sun is so grilling that before May the flowers are all withered\r\nup.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid we shall not be allowed to go to Ronda. Mr. Layard has sent\r\nword from Madrid to the Governor to prevent any one going, as the famous\r\nbrigand chief Don Diego is there with his crew. We had hoped to get up a\r\nsufficiently large armed party, but so many stories have come, that Aunt\r\nSophy and her maid, Mrs. Jarvis, are getting into an agony about losing\r\ntheir noses and ears.\r\n\r\n“The Governor, Sir Fenwick Williams, has been excessively civil to us,\r\nbut our principal acquaintance here is quite romantic. The first day\r\nwhen we went down to the _table-d’hôte_, there were only two others\r\npresent, a Scotch commercial traveller, and, below him, a rather\r\nwell-looking Spaniard, evidently a gentleman, but with an odd short\r\nfigure and squeaky voice. He bowed very civilly as we came in, and we\r\nreturned it. In the middle of dinner a band of Scotch bagpipers came\r\nplaying under the window, and I was seized with a desire to jump up and\r\nlook at them. Involuntarily I looked across the table to see what the\r\nothers were going to do, when the unknown gave a strange bow and wave\r\nof _permission_! With that wave came back to my mind a picture in the\r\nDuchesse de Montpensier’s bedroom at Seville: it was her brother-in-law,\r\nDon Francisco d’Assise, ex-King of Spain! Since then we have breakfasted\r\nand dined with him every day, and seen him constantly besides. This\r\nafternoon I sat out with him in the gardens, and we have had endless\r\ntalk--the result of which is that I certainly do not believe a word of\r\nthe stories against him, and think that, though not clever and rather\r\neccentric, he is by no means an idiot, but a very kind-hearted,\r\nwell-intentioned person. He is kept here waiting for a steamer to take\r\nhim to Marseilles, as he cannot land at any of the Spanish ports. He\r\ncalls himself the Comte de Balsaño, and is quite alone here, and\r\nevidently quite separated from Queen Isabella. He never mentions her or\r\nSpain, but talks quite openly of his youth in Portugal and his visits to\r\nFrance, England, Ireland, &c.\r\n\r\n“I have remained with him while Miss Wright is gone to Tangiers with her\r\nreal nephew, Major Howard Irby. This beginning of March always brings\r\nwith it many sad recollections, the date--always nearing March 4--of all\r\nour greatest anxieties, at Pau, Piazza di Spagna, Via Babuino, Via\r\nGregoriana. It is almost as incredible to me now as a year and a half\r\nago to feel that it is all over--the agony of suspense so often endured,\r\nand that life is now a dead calm without either sunshine or storm to\r\nlook forward to.\r\n\r\n“The King says that of all the things which astonish him in England,\r\nthat which astonishes him most is that the Anglo-Catholics (so called),\r\nwho are free to do as they please, are seeking to have confession--‘the\r\nbane of the Roman Catholic religion, which has brought misery and\r\ndisunion into so many Spanish homes.’ One felt sure he was thinking of\r\nFather Claret and the Queen, but he never mentioned them.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 6._--The poor King left yesterday for Southampton--a most\r\naffectionate leave-taking. He says he will come to Holmhurst: how odd if\r\nhe does!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Malaga, March 17._--Our pleasantest acquaintances at Gibraltar were\r\nthe Augustus Phillimores, with whom we spent our last day--in such a\r\nlovely garden on the side of the Rock, filled with gigantic daturas,\r\ndaphnes, oranges, and gorgeous creeping Bougainvillias. Admiral\r\nPhillimore’s boat took us on board the _Lisbon_, where we got through\r\nthe voyage very well, huddled up under cloaks on deck through the long\r\nnight. There is nothing to see at Malaga--a dismal, dusty, ugly place.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Hôtel Siete Suelos, Granada, March 19._--We had a dreadful journey\r\nhere--rail to Las Salinas and then the most extraordinary diligence\r\njourney, in a carriage drawn by eight mules, at midnight, over no road,\r\nbut rocks, marshes, and along the edge of precipices--quite frightful.\r\nWhy we were _not_ overturned I cannot imagine. I could get no place\r\nexcept at the top, and held on with the greatest difficulty in the\r\nfearful lunges. We reached Granada about 3½ A.M., seeing nothing that\r\nnight, but wearily conscious of the long ascent to the Siete Suelos.\r\n\r\n“How lovely was the morning awakening! our rooms looking down long\r\narcades of high arching elms, with fountains foaming in the openings of\r\nthe woods, birds singing, and violets scenting the whole air. It is\r\nindeed alike the paradise of nature and art. Through the first day I\r\nnever entered the Alhambra, but sat restfully satisfied with the\r\nabsorbing loveliness of the surrounding gorges, and sketched the\r\nvenerable Gate of Justice, glowing in gorgeous golden light. This\r\nmorning we went early to the Moorish palace. It is beyond all\r\nimagination of beauty. As you cross the threshold you pass out of fact\r\ninto fairyland. I sat six hours drawing the Court of Blessing without\r\nmoving, and then we climbed the heights of S. Nicolas and overlooked the\r\nwhole palace, with the grand snow peaks of Sierra Nevada rising behind.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Granada, April 1--Easter Sunday._--To-day especially I do not feel as\r\nif I was at Granada, but in the churchyard at Hurstmonceaux. I am sure\r\nMrs. Medhurst and other loving hands will have decorated our most dear\r\nspot with flowers. Aunt Sophy is most kind, only too kind and indulgent\r\nalways, but the thought of the one for and _through_ whom alone I could\r\nreally enjoy anything is never absent from me. I feel as if I lived in a\r\nlife which was not mine--beautiful often, but only a beautiful\r\nmoonlight: the sunlight has faded.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOLEDO.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Toledo, April 11._--We had twelve hours’ diligence from Granada, saw\r\nJaen Cathedral on the way, and joined the railroad at the little station\r\nof Mengibar. Next morning found us at Aranjuez, a sort of Spanish\r\nHampton Court, rather quaint and pleasant, four-fifths of the place\r\nbeing taken up by the palace and its belongings, so much beloved by\r\nIsabella (II.), but since deserted. We went to bed for four hours, and\r\nspent the rest of the day in surveying half-furnished palaces, unkempt\r\ngardens, and dried-up fountains, yet pleasant from the winding Tagus,\r\nlilacs and Judas-trees in full bloom, and birds singing. It was a nice\r\nprimitive little inn, and the landlord sat on the wooden gallery in the\r\nevening and played the guitar, and all his men and maids sang round him\r\nin patriarchal family fashion.\r\n\r\n“On the whole, I feel a little disappointed at present with this\r\ncurious, desolate old city: the cathedral and everything else looks so\r\nsmall after one’s expectations, and the guide-books exaggerate so\r\ntremendously all over Spain.\r\n\r\n“My last day at Granada was saddened by your mention of what is really a\r\ngreat loss to me--dear old Mr. Liddell’s death,[13] so kind to me ever\r\nsince I was a little boy, and endeared by the many associations of most\r\nhappy visits at Bamborough and Easington. I had also sad news from\r\nHolmhurst in the death of dear sweet Romo, the Mother’s own little dog,\r\nwhich no other can ever be.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Madrid, April 20._--We like Madrid better than we expected. It is a\r\npoor miniature of Paris, the Prado like the Champs Elysées, the Museo\r\nanswering to the Louvre, though all on the smallest possible scale. It\r\nhas been everything to us having our kind friends Don Juan and Doña\r\nEmilia de Riaño here, and we have seen a great deal of them. They have a\r\nbeautiful house, full of books and pictures, and every day she has come\r\nto take us out, and has gone with us everywhere, taking us to visit all\r\nthe interesting literary and artistic people, showing us all the\r\npolitical characters on the Prado, escorting us to galleries, &c., and\r\nin herself a mine of information of the most beautiful and delightful\r\nkind--a sort of younger Lady Waterford. She gives a dreadful picture of\r\nthe immorality of society in Madrid under the Italian King, the want of\r\nlaw, the hopelessness of redress; that everything is gained by influence\r\nin high places, nothing by right. A revolution is expected any day, and\r\nthen the King must go. The aristocratic Madrilenians all speak of him as\r\n‘the little Italian wretch,’ though they pity his pretty amiable Queen.\r\nAll seem to want to get rid of him, and, whatever is said by English\r\nnewspapers, we have never seen any one in Spain who was not hankering\r\nafter the Bourbons and the handsome young Prince of Asturias, who is\r\nsure to be king soon.\r\n\r\n“The pleasantest of all the people Madame de Riaño has taken us to visit\r\nare the splendid artist Don Juan de Madraza and his most lovely\r\nwife.[14]\r\n\r\n“The Layards have been very civil. At a party there we met no end of\r\nSpanish grandees. The Queen’s lady-in-waiting (she has only two who\r\nwill consent to take office), Marqueza d’Almena, was quite lovely in\r\nwhite satin and pearls--like an old picture.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Segovia, April 28._--I was quite ill at Madrid with severe sore throat\r\nand cough, and this in spite of the care I was always taking of myself,\r\nhaving been so afraid of falling ill. But it is the most treacherous\r\nclimate, and, from burning heat, changes to fierce ice-laden winds from\r\nthe Guadarama and torrents of cold rain. I was shut up five days, but\r\ncheered by visits from Madame de Riaño, young Arthur Seymour an attaché,\r\nand the last day, to my great delight, the well-known Holmhurst faces of\r\nMr. and Mrs. Scrivens (Hastings banker), brimming with Sussex news. Mr.\r\nLayard was evidently very anxious to get us and all other travelling\r\nEnglish safe out of Spain, but we preferred the alternative, suggested\r\nby the Riaños, of coming to this ‘_muy pacifico_’ place, and waiting\r\ntill the storm was a little blown over. Madrid was certainly in a most\r\nuncomfortable state, the Italian King feeling the days of his rule quite\r\nnumbered, houses being entered night and day, and arrests going on\r\neverywhere. I do not know what English papers tell, but the Spanish\r\naccounts are alarming of the whole of the north as overrun by Carlists,\r\nand that they have taken Vittoria and stopped the tunnel on the main\r\nline.\r\n\r\n“It was a dreadful journey here. The road was cut through the snow, but\r\nthere was fifteen feet of it on either side the way on the top of the\r\nGuadarama. However, our ten mules dragged us safely along. Segovia is\r\ngloriously picturesque, and the hotel a very tolerable--pothouse.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Salamanca, May 5._--One day at the Segovia _table-d’hôte_ we had the\r\nmost unusual sight of a pleasing young Englishman, who rambled about and\r\ndrew with us all afternoon, and then turned out to be--the Duchess of\r\nCleveland’s younger son, Everard Primrose.[15]\r\n\r\n“May-day we spent at La Granja, one of the many royal palaces, and one\r\nwhich would quite enchant you. It is a quaint old French château in\r\nlovely woods full of fountains and waterfalls, quite close under the\r\nsnow mountains; and the high peaks, one glittering mass of snow, rise\r\nthrough the trees before the windows. The inhabitants were longing there\r\nto have the Bourbons back, and only spoke of the present King as ‘the\r\ninoffensive Italian.’ Even Cristina and Isabella will be cordially\r\nwelcomed if they return with the young Alfonso.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEGOVIA]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“On May 2nd we left Segovia and went for one night to the Escurial--such\r\na gigantic place, no beauty, but very curious, and the relics of the\r\ntruly religious though cruelly bigoted Philip II. very interesting.\r\nThen we were a day at Avila, at an English inn kept by Mr. John Smith\r\nand his daughter--kindly, hearty people. Avila is a paradise for\r\nartists, and has remains in plenty of Ferdinand and Isabella, in whose\r\nintimate companionship one seems to live during one’s whole tour in\r\nSpain. It was a most fatiguing night-journey of ten hours to Salamanca,\r\na place I have especially wished to see--not beautiful, but very\r\ncurious, and we have introductions to all the great people of the place.\r\n\r\n“I shall be _very_ glad now to get home again. It is such an immense\r\nseparation from every one one has ever seen or heard of, and such a long\r\ntime to be so excessively uncomfortable as one must be at even the best\r\nplaces in Spain. Five-o’clock tea, which we occasionally cook in a\r\nsaucepan--without milk of course--is a prime luxury, and is to be\r\nindulged in to-day as it is Sunday.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Biarritz, May 12._--We are thankful to be safe here, having seen\r\nZamora, Valladolid, and Burgos since we left Salamanca. The stations\r\nwere in an excited state, the platforms crowded with people waiting for\r\nnews or giving it, but we met with no difficulties. I cannot say with\r\nwhat a thrill of pleasure I crossed the Bidassoa and left the great\r\ndiscomforts of Spain behind. What a luxury this morning to see once more\r\ntea! butter!! cow’s milk!!!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Paris, May 20._--Most lovely does France look after Spain--the\r\nflowers, the grass, the rich luxuriant green, of which there is more to\r\nbe seen from the ugliest French station than in the whole of the\r\nSpanish peninsula after you leave the Pyrenees. I have spent the\r\ngreater part of three days at the Embassy, where George Sheffield is\r\nmost affectionate and kind--no brother could be more so. We have been\r\nabout everywhere together, and it is certainly most charming to be with\r\na friend who is always the same, and associated with nineteen years of\r\none’s intimate past.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dover Station, May 23._--On Monday George drove me in one of the open\r\ncarriages of the Embassy through the Bois de Boulogne to S. Cloud, and I\r\nthought the woods rather improved by the war injuries than otherwise,\r\nthe bits cut down sprouting up so quickly in bright green acacia, and\r\nforming a pleasant contrast with the darker groves beyond. We strolled\r\nround the ruined château, and George showed the room whither he went to\r\nmeet the council, and offer British interference just before war was\r\ndeclared, in vain, and now it is a heap of ruins--blackened walls,\r\nbroken caryatides.[16] What a lovely view it is of Paris from the\r\nterrace: I had never seen it before. Pretty young French ladies were\r\nbegging at all the park gates for the dishoused poor of the place, as\r\nthey do at the Exhibition for the payment of the Prussian debt. George\r\nwas as delightful as only he can be when he likes, and we were perfectly\r\nhappy together. At 7 P.M. I went again to the Embassy. All the lower\r\nrooms were lighted and full of flowers, the corridors all pink geraniums\r\nwith a mist of white spirea over them. The Duchesse de la Tremouille was\r\nthere, as hideous as people of historic name usually are. Little fat\r\nLord Lyons was most amiable, but his figure is like a pumpkin with an\r\napple on the top. It is difficult to believe he is as clever as he is\r\nsupposed to be. He is sometimes amusing, however. Of his diplomatic\r\nrelations with the Pope he says, ‘It is so difficult to deal\r\ndiplomatically with the Holy Spirit.’ He boasts that he arrived at the\r\nEmbassy with all he wanted contained in a single portmanteau, and that\r\nif he were called upon to leave it for ever to-day, the same would\r\nsuffice. He has collected and acquired--nothing! He evidently adores\r\nGeorge, and I don’t wonder!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOUNTAIN OF S.

I\r\nfound fat John Gidman waiting at the Hastings station, and drove up\r\nthrough the flowery lanes to receive dear Lea’s welcome--most tearfully\r\njoyous. The little home looks very lovely, and I cannot be thankful\r\nenough--though its sunshine is always mixed with shadow--to have a home\r\nin which everything is a precious memorial of my sacred past, where\r\nevery shrub in the garden has been touched by my mother’s hand, every\r\nlittle walk trodden by her footsteps, and where I can bring up mental\r\npictures of her in every room. In all that remains I can trace the sweet\r\nwisdom which for years laid up so much to comfort me, which sought to\r\nbuy this place when she did, in order to give sufficient association to\r\nmake it precious to me; above all, which urged her to the supreme effort\r\nof returning here in order to leave it for me with the last sacred\r\nrecollections of her life. In the work of gathering up the fragments\r\nfrom that dear life I am again already engrossed, and Spain and its\r\ninterests are passing into the far away; yet I look back upon them with\r\nmuch gratitude, and especially upon your long unvaried kindness and your\r\npatience with my many faults.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 26._--To-night it blows a hurricane, and the wind moans sadly. A\r\nhowling wind, I think, is the most melancholy natural accompaniment\r\nwhich can come to a solitary life. After this, I must give you--to\r\nmeditate on--a beautiful passage I have been reading in Mrs.\r\nSomerville--‘At a very small height above the surface of the earth the\r\nnoise of the tempest ceases, and the thunder is heard no more in those\r\nboundless regions where the heavenly bodies accomplish their periods in\r\neternal and sublime silence.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is partly the relief I experienced after Spain and the animation of\r\never-changing society which make me look back upon the summer of 1872 as\r\none of the happiest I have spent at Holmhurst. A constant succession of\r\nguests filled our little chambers, every one was pleased, and the\r\nweather was glorious. I was away also for several short but very\r\npleasant glimpses of London, and began to feel how little the virulence\r\nof some of my family signified when there was still so much friendship\r\nand affection left to me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, June 21, 1872._--I am feeling ungrateful for never having\r\nwritten since my happy fortnight with you came to a close, a time which\r\nI enjoyed more than I ever expected to enjoy anything again, and which\r\nmade me feel there might still be something worth living on for, so much\r\nkindness and affection did I receive from so many. It is pleasant too to\r\nthink of your comfortable home, which rises before me in a gallery of\r\nhappy pictures, and I know it all so well now, from the parrot in Mrs.\r\nJarvis’s room to the red geraniums in your window. I have had Mrs. and\r\nMiss Kuper here, and now I am alone, no voice but that of the\r\nguinea-fowls shrieking ‘Come back’ in the garden. I miss all my London\r\nfriends very much, but suppose one would not enjoy it if it went on\r\nalways, and certainly solitude is the time for work: I did eleven hours\r\nof it yesterday. As regards my books, I feel more and more with Arnold\r\nthat a man is only fit to teach as long as he is himself learning\r\ndaily.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, June 25._--‘Poor Aunt Sophy’ would not have thought she had\r\ndone nothing to cheer me, could she have seen the interest with which I\r\nread her letter and returned to it over and over again. Such a letter is\r\nquite delightful, and here has the effect of one reaching Robinson\r\nCrusoe in Juan Fernandez, so complete is the silence and solitude when\r\nno one is staying here.\r\n\r\n    ‘The flowers my guests, the birds my pensioners,\r\n     Books my companions, and but few beside.’[18]\r\n\r\n“How I delight in knowing all that the delightful human beings are\r\nabout, of whom I think now as living in another hemisphere. I should\r\nlike to see more of people--perhaps another year I may not be so busy:\r\nthat is, I long for the cream which I enjoyed with you, but I should not\r\ncare for the milk and water of a country neighbourhood. If one has too\r\nmuch people-seeing, however, even of the London best, one feels that it\r\nis ‘a withering world,’[19] and that if--\r\n\r\n    ‘The world is too much with us, late and soon,\r\n     Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers.’[20]\r\n\r\n“I have been made very ill-tempered all day because Murray, during my\r\nabsence in Spain, has published a second edition of my Oxfordshire\r\nHandbook, _greatly_ altered, without consulting me, and it seems to me\r\nutterly spoilt and vulgarised. He is obliged by his contract to give me\r\n£40, but I would a great deal rather have seen the book uninjured and\r\nreceived nothing.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER (after a long visit from her at Holmhurst).\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, August 18, 1872._--There seems quite a chaos of things\r\nalready to be said to the dear cousin who has so long shared our quiet\r\nlife, and who has so much care for the simple interests of this little\r\nhome. Much have I missed her--in her chair, with her crotchet; sitting\r\non the terrace; and especially in the early morning walk yesterday, when\r\nthe garden was in its richest beauty, all the crimson and blue flowers\r\ntwinkling through a veil of dewdrops, and when ‘the gentleness of Heaven\r\nwas on the sea,’ as Wordsworth would say. I am grieved to think of you\r\nin London, instead of in your country home.\r\n\r\n“Our visit to Hurstmonceaux was thoroughly enjoyed by Mr. and Mrs.\r\nPile.[21] For myself, I shall always feel such short visits produce\r\nsuch extreme tension of conflicting feelings that they are scarcely a\r\npleasure. Most lovely was the drive for miles through Ashburnham beech\r\nand pine woods and by its old timber-yard. At Lime Cross we saw Mrs.\r\nIsted at her familiar window, and the dear woman sat there all the\r\nafternoon to have another glimpse on our return. We drove to the foot of\r\nthe hill and walked up to the church. Our sacred spot looked most\r\npeaceful, its double hedge of fuchsia in full flower, and the turf as\r\nsmooth as velvet. We had luncheon in the church porch, and then went to\r\nthe castle, and back through the park uplands, high with fern, to\r\nHurstmonceaux Place. How often, at Hurstmonceaux especially, I now feel\r\nthe force of Wordsworth’s lines:\r\n\r\n    ‘Thanks to the human heart by which we live,\r\n     Thanks to its tenderness, its joys and fears,\r\n     To me the meanest flower that blows can give\r\n     Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Sept. 6, 1872._--If my many guests of the last weeks have\r\nliked their visits, I have most entirely enjoyed having them and the\r\npleasant influx of new life and new ideas. Dear old Mrs. Robert Hare is\r\nnow very happy here, and most grateful for the very small kindness I am\r\nable to show. I have pressed her to make a long visit, as it is a real\r\ndelight to give so much pleasure, though humbling to think that, when\r\none can do it so easily, one does not do it oftener. She is quite\r\nstone-deaf, so we sit opposite one another and correspond on a\r\nslate.[22] On Tuesday I fetched Marcus Hare from Battle. He also is\r\nintensely happy here; but his aunts, the Miss Stanleys, have written to\r\nrefuse to see him again or allow him to visit them, because he has been\r\nto see the author of the ‘Memorials.’ I took him to Hurstmonceaux\r\nyesterday, and lovely was the first flush of autumn on our dear woods,\r\nwhile the castle looked most grand in the solemn stillness of its misty\r\nhollow. Next week I shall have George Sheffield here.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM THE LIBRARY WINDOW, FORD.][24]\r\n\r\nIn September I paid a pleasant visit to my cousin Edward Liddell, whom I\r\nfound married to his sweet wife (Christina Fraser Tytler) and living in\r\nthe Rectory in Wimpole Park in Cambridgeshire, close to the great house\r\nof our cousin Lord Hardwicke, which is very ugly, though it contains\r\nmany fine pictures.[23] In the beginning of October I was at Ford with\r\nLady Waterford, meeting the Ellices, Lady Marion Alford, and Lady\r\nHerbert of Lea, who had much to tell of La Palma, the _estatica_ of\r\nBrindisi, who had the stigmata, and could tell wonderful truths to\r\npeople about their past and future. Lady Herbert had been to America,\r\nTrinidad, Africa--in fact, everywhere, and in each country had, or\r\nthought she had, the most astounding adventures--living with bandits in\r\na cave, overturned on a precipice, &c. She had travelled in Spain and\r\nwas brimful of its delights. She had armed herself with a Papal permit\r\nto enter all monasteries and convents. She had annexed the Bishop of\r\nSalamanca and driven in his coach to Alva, the scene of S. Teresa’s\r\nlater life. The nuns refused to let her come in, and the abbess\r\ndeclared it was unheard of; but when Lady Herbert produced the bishop\r\nand the Papal brief, she got in, and the nuns were so captivated that\r\nthey not only showed her S. Teresa’s dead body, but dressed her up in\r\nall S. Teresa’s clothes, and set her in S. Teresa’s arm-chair, and gave\r\nher her supper out of S. Teresa’s porringer and platter. “Can you see\r\nLady Jane Ellice’s face,” I read in a letter from Ford to Miss\r\nLeycester, “as Lady Herbert ‘goes on’ about the Blessed Paul of the\r\nCross, the holy shift of S. Teresa, and the saintly privileges of a\r\nhermit’s life?” The first evening she was at Ford Lady Herbert said:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Did you never hear the story of ‘La Jolie Jambe’? Well, then, I will\r\ntell it you. Robert, my brother-in-law, told me. He knew the old lady it\r\nwas all about in Paris, and had very often gone to sit with her.\r\n\r\n“It was an old lady who lived at ‘le pavillon dans le jardin.’ The great\r\nhouse in the Faubourg was given up to the son, you know, and she lived\r\nin the pavillon. It was a very small house, only five or six rooms, and\r\nwas magnificently furnished, for the old lady was very rich indeed, and\r\nhad a great many jewels and other valuable things. She lived quite alone\r\nin the pavillon with her maid, but it was considered quite safe in that\r\nhigh-terraced garden, raised above everything else, and which could only\r\nbe approached through the house.\r\n\r\n“However, one morning the old lady was found murdered, and all her\r\njewels and valuables were gone. Of course suspicion fell upon the maid,\r\nfor who else could it be? She was taken up and tried. The evidence was\r\ninsufficient to convict her, and she was released, but every one\r\nbelieved her guilty. Of course she could get no other place, and she was\r\nso shunned and pointed at as a murderess that her life was a burden to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“One day, eleven years after, the maid was walking down a street when\r\nshe met a man, who, as she passed, looked suddenly at her and exclaimed,\r\n‘Oh, la jolie jambe!’ She immediately rushed up to a sergeant-de-ville\r\nand exclaimed, ‘Arrêtez-moi cet homme.’ The man was confused and\r\nhesitated, but she continued in an agony, ‘Arrêtez-le, je vous dis: je\r\nl’accuse, je l’accuse du meurtre de ma maîtresse.’ Meanwhile the man had\r\nmade off, but he was pursued and taken.\r\n\r\n“The maid said at the trial, that, on the night of the murder, the\r\nwindows of the pavilion had been open down to the ground; that they were\r\nso when she was going to bed; that as she was getting into bed she sat\r\nfor a minute on its edge to admire her legs, looked at them, patted one\r\nof them complacently, and exclaimed, ‘Oh, la jolie jambe!’\r\n\r\n“The man then confessed that while he had been hidden in the bushes of\r\nthe garden waiting to commit his crime, he had seen the maid and heard\r\nher, and that, when he met her in the street, the scene and the words\r\nrushed back upon his mind so suddenly, that, as if under an irresistible\r\nimpulse, his lips framed the words ‘Oh, la jolie jambe.’ The man was\r\nexecuted.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLady Herbert also told us that--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd, had a sheep-dog to which he was quite\r\ndevoted, and which used to go out and collect his sheep. One day in\r\nwinter a thick snow came on, and Hogg was in the greatest anxiety about\r\nhis flocks. He called his dog and explained all the matter to him,\r\ntelling him how he was going all round one side of the moors himself to\r\ndrive in his sheep, and that he was to go the other way and collect. The\r\ndog understood perfectly. Late in the evening the Shepherd returned\r\nperfectly exhausted, bringing in his flock through the deep snow, but\r\nthe dog had not come back. Hour after hour passed and the dog did not\r\nreturn. The Shepherd, who was devoted to his dog, was very anxious about\r\nit, when at last he heard a whining and scratching at the door, and\r\ngoing out, found the dog bringing all his sheep safe, and in its mouth a\r\nlittle puppy, which it laid at its master’s feet, and instantly darted\r\noff through the snow to seek another and bring it in. The poor thing had\r\npuppied in the snow, but would not on that account neglect one iota of\r\nits duty. It brought in its second puppy, laid it in its master’s lap,\r\nlooked up wistfully in his face as if beseeching him to take care of it,\r\nand--died.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLady Marion Alford is a real _grande dame_. Some one, Miss Mary Boyle, I\r\nthink, wrote a little book called the “Court of Queen Marion,”\r\ndescriptive of her and her intimate circle. At Ford she talked much of\r\nthe pleasure of Azeglio’s _Ricordi_, how he was the first Italian\r\nwriter who had got out of the ‘_conciosiachè_ style,’ and she was\r\ndelightful with her reminiscences of Italy:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Once when I was spending the summer in Italy I wanted models, and I was\r\ntold by an old general, a friend of mine, that I had better advertise,\r\nsend up to the priests in the mountains, and tell them to send down all\r\nthe prettiest children in their villages to be looked at: the lady\r\nwanted models; those she chose she should pay, the others should each\r\nhave sixpence and a cake. I was told I had better prepare for a good\r\nmany--perhaps a hundred might come. When the day came, I never shall\r\nforget our old servant’s face when he rushed in--‘Miladi, Miladi, the\r\nlane is full of them.’ There were seven hundred. It was very difficult\r\nto choose. We made them pass in at one door of the villa and out at the\r\nother. Those we selected we sent into the garden, and from these we\r\nchose again. Some were perfect monsters, for every mother thought her\r\nown child perfection. Those we selected to come first were a lovely\r\nfamily of three children with their mother. They were to come on a\r\nWednesday. The day came, and they never appeared: the next, and still\r\nthey did not come. Then we asked our old general about it, and he said,\r\n‘The fact is, I have kicked my carpenter downstairs this morning because\r\nhe said you were sending for the children to suck their blood, and they\r\nall think so.’ They none of them ever came.\r\n\r\n“Our old maid Teresa was of a very romantic turn of mind. We used, when\r\nI was a child, to live in the Palazzo Sciarra, where the ‘Maddalena\r\ndella Radice’ is. She used to stand opposite to the picture and exclaim\r\nin gulpy tones, ‘Sono bestia io, e non capisco niente, ma questo me\r\npare--pittoresco.’ My little sister, when our father was away, stood one\r\nday at the top of the stairs and said, ‘Io son padrona di casa, e no son\r\npadrona di casa: voi siete la servitu, e non siete la servitu.’ Teresa\r\nexclaimed, ‘Questa diavola, com’ é carina.’ We used to hear Teresa\r\ntalking to our other maid, and they boasted of the number of times they\r\nhad been beaten by their husbands. One day--it was during the French\r\noccupation, when the bread was doled out--Teresa took her tambourine\r\nwith her when she went to get it, for they all loved flirting with the\r\nsoldiers; and when her husband asked her what it was for, she said it\r\nwas to bring back the bread in. But when she got inside the circle of\r\nsoldiers, they had a merry _saltarello_. The husband was kept back\r\noutside the circle, and stood there furious. At first she laughed at\r\nhim, but then when he went away and came back again, she got really\r\nfrightened. And when she came out of the circle he flogged her with a\r\nwhip all the way back to the Trastevere, and she ran before him\r\nscreaming.\r\n\r\n“How curious it is that ‘_Est locanda_’ is still to be seen in Roman\r\nwindows of houses to be let--the one little relic of Latin: and how odd\r\nthe word for lodgings being the same in all languages--Quartier,\r\nQuartos, Quartiere, Quarter, &c.”\r\n\r\nLady Marion also said:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“As we were leaving Gibraltar, three of the shells from the practising\r\nfell quite close to our yacht. ‘Are you not very much frightened?’ said\r\na French gentleman on board. ‘Not in the least,’ I said. ‘How could I\r\nbe? our men are such perfect marksmen;’ but of course I was dreadfully.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis story is wonderfully characteristic of the speaker: the Empress\r\nCatherine might have given such an answer. About ghosts Lady Marion was\r\nvery amusing:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“When I went to Belvoir with Lady Caroline Cust, they danced in the\r\nevening. I went upstairs early, for I was tired. As I was going to my\r\nroom, Lady Jersey--it was wrong of her, I think--said, ‘Oh, I see you\r\nare put into the ghost-room.’ I said, ‘I am quite happy; there are no\r\nreal ghosts here, I think.’--‘Well,’ said Lady Jersey, ‘I can only say\r\nMiss Drummond slept there last night, and she received letters of\r\nimportance this morning and left before breakfast.’ Well, I went into my\r\nroom, and lit the candles and made up the fire, but very soon I gave a\r\ngreat jump, for I heard the most dreadful noise close at my\r\nelbow--Oh-o-oo-oo!’ I thought of course that it was a practical joke,\r\nand began to examine every corner of the room, thinking some one must be\r\nhidden there; then I rang my bell. When my maid came in I said, ‘Now\r\ndon’t be frightened, but there is some one hidden in this room\r\nsomewhere, and you must help me to find him.’ Very soon the noise came\r\nagain. Then Lady Caroline came, and she heard it: then her maid came.\r\nThe noise occurred about every five minutes. We examined everything and\r\nstood in each corner of the room. The noise then seemed close to each of\r\nus. At last Lady Caroline said, ‘I can stand this no longer, and I must\r\ngo,’ and she and her maid went away and shut themselves into the next\r\nroom. Then I said to my maid, ‘If you are frightened you had better go,’\r\nbut she protested that she would rather stay where she was; after what\r\nshe had heard, anything would be better than facing the long lonely\r\npassages alone. However, just at that moment ‘Oh-o-oo-oo!’ went off\r\nagain close to her ear, and with one spring she darted out of the room\r\nand ran off as hard as ever she could. I went courageously to bed and\r\ndetermined to brave it out. But the thing went to bed too, and went off\r\nat intervals on the pillow close to my face. And at last it grated on my\r\nnerves to such a degree that I could bear it no longer, and I dragged a\r\nmattress into Lady Caroline’s room and slept there till dawn. The next\r\nmorning I also received letters of importance and left before breakfast.\r\n\r\n“Before I left, I sent for the housekeeper, and said, ‘You really should\r\nnot put people into that room,’ and told her what had happened. She was\r\nmuch distressed, and told me that there really was no other room in the\r\nhouse then, but confessed it had often happened so before. Some time\r\nafter I went over to Belvoir with some friends who wanted to see the\r\ncastle, and the housekeeper then told me that the same thing had\r\nhappened again in that room, which was now permanently shut up.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOther guests at Ford were Mrs. Richard Boyle (known as E. V. B.), and\r\nher daughter--very quaint and original, and the mother a capital artist.\r\nWe went to the Rowting Lynn, a beautiful spot surrounded with rocks\r\noverhung by old oak-trees. “Did you enjoy your walk?” said Lady\r\nWaterford to Mrs. Boyle as we came in. “Yes, excessively. You never told\r\nme you had a waterfall. You offered me a coal-pit, but the waterfall you\r\nforgot to mention.”\r\n\r\nLady Waterford was herself more delightful than ever. As Marocetti said\r\nof her, “C’est un grand homme, mais une femme charmante.” Here are some\r\nscraps from her conversation:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“That is a sketch of L. H. She did not know I was drawing her. She looks\r\nsixteen, but is quite middle-aged. Mama used to say she was like\r\npreserved green peas. Preserved green peas are not quite so good as real\r\ngreen peas, but they do very nearly as well.’\r\n\r\n“I always take a little book with me in the train and draw the things as\r\nI pass them. That is some railings against a sunset sky when it was\r\nalmost dark: I thought it was like a bit of Tintoret.\r\n\r\n“How trying it is to be kept waiting for people. Don’t you know the\r\nItalian proverb?--\r\n\r\n    ‘Aspettare e non venire,\r\n     Star in letto e non dormire,\r\n     Vuol piacer, e non gradire.’\r\n\r\nMiss Boyle had a much better one, though--\r\n\r\n    ‘To do, to suffer, is a glorious state,\r\n     But a more noble portion is to _wait_.’\r\n\r\n“How beautiful the singing was in our young days--Grisi and Mario and\r\nLablache, who went straight to one’s heart and fluttered there.\r\n\r\n“Some one, old Madame de Flahault I think it was, asked what she could\r\ngive as a present. It must be ‘très rare et pas coûteux,’ and it was\r\nsuggested that she should give a lock of her hair.\r\n\r\n“You are like the old lady who said she had never had a ripe peach in\r\nher life, because when she was young all the old people had them, and\r\nwhen she grew old all the young people had them.\r\n\r\n“I am longing to read ‘Marjory,’[25] but I cannot when I have my house\r\nfull--my novel _en action_. When people are here and tell me their\r\nlittle stories, that is what I like best to read.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n“_Crook Hall, Lancashire, Oct. 20, 1872._--My visit at Ford was\r\nperfectly enchanting, and I made several new friendships there in what\r\nyou think my sudden way, especially one with Lord Ronald Gower, which I\r\nthink may become a pleasure. I much enjoyed, too, making friends with\r\nMr. Beaumont and Lady Margaret B., one of the very best types of a fine\r\nlady it is possible to meet, almost funnily aristocratic in all her\r\nideas, and high-minded in proportion. Her little person is arrayed in\r\ngowns which were as much things of beauty _in their way_ as a mountain\r\nlandscape; there is such a difference between ‘smart dress,’ and such a\r\nlovely harmony of shade and colour, as one can scarcely think of as mere\r\nclothing. Then I saw a great deal of the dear Lady Waterford, and am\r\nmore than ever instructed and touched by her beautiful, noble, holy\r\nlife. It is absolutely impossible to her to ‘think any evil,’ and so, to\r\nher, the best side of every one comes out. As an easier ‘let down’ than\r\nanything else, I accepted an invitation from thence to Lord and Lady\r\nGrey for three days at Howick on the wild sea-coast, and enjoyed my\r\nvisit immensely. No one has more completely ‘l’art de narrer’ than Lady\r\nGrey, and he is full of old-fashioned courtesy and kindness, such\r\nwinning manners and heart-whole goodness.\r\n\r\n“My ‘Memorials’ are out! Ere this all will have it. I know there will be\r\nmuch abuse and many varieties of opinion, but I am conscious of having\r\ncarried out the book as I believe to be best for others, not for myself,\r\nand in this consciousness can bear what is said. ‘Je laisse couler le\r\ntorrent,’ as Mme. de Sevigné used to say. One thing I dread is, that\r\npeople should think I am a better person than I am, on reading the book:\r\nfor I suppose it is always the fact that a man’s book is the best of\r\nhim, his thought better than his life. But in any case, it is a relief\r\nto have it out (as Arthur and Mary Stanley, at the last moment,\r\npersuaded Mr. Murray to go to my publishers to try to stop the\r\npublication), yet it is also a wrench to part with the occupation and\r\nchief thought of two desolate years.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dalton Hall, Oct. 28._--A second edition of the ‘Memorials’ was called\r\nfor before it had been out three days. I have had many letters about\r\nit--charming ones from Mrs. Arnold and the old Baroness de Bunsen. The\r\nolive-bearing dove has gone out with healing on his wings, and all the\r\nmists are cleared off and the long-standing feuds of the Hare family\r\nhealed by the book. Still the Stanleys make no sign.\r\n\r\n    ‘Alas! how easily things go wrong!\r\n     A sigh too much or a kiss too long,\r\n     And there follows a mist and a weeping rain,\r\n     And life is never the same again.’[26]\r\n\r\n“I certainly do suffer very much when people mean me to do so, to a\r\ndegree which must be quite satisfactory to them; but then in\r\ncompensation I always enjoy very much when it is the reverse. It is as I\r\nread somewhere--‘He who is the first to be touched by the thorns is\r\nsoonest awake to the flowers.’\r\n\r\n“From the Oswald Penrhyns’ at Huyton I saw in the same day two great\r\nhouses--the vast and hideous Knowsley, which interested me from its\r\nconnection with my Mother’s youth, and the glorious old hall of Speke,\r\nwhich has an air of venerable beauty quite unrivalled. Then I went for\r\nsome days to Lord Brougham’s, a delightful place, full of tapestry and\r\npictures, but though it looks old, really a modern castle, with the\r\nruins of the truly ancient castle on the river-bank hard by.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn November I went north again to stay for the first time at Bretton\r\nnear Wakefield, a great house in the Black Country, built by the famous\r\n“Madam Beaumont,” who followed the example of her ancestors in making an\r\nenormous fortune by her skilful management of her lead-mines. It is\r\nrecorded that when Mr. Pitt was dining with her, and all her magnificent\r\nplate was set out, she exclaimed, with pardonable pride, “That is all\r\nthe lead-mines,” when he replied, “Oh, really, I thought it was silver,”\r\nand would talk on, to her great annoyance, and never allow her a moment\r\nto explain. I had made friends with her grandson, Wentworth Beaumont, at\r\nFord, when he was there with his wife Lady Margaret, whom I have always\r\nregarded as the most thoroughly pleasant specimen in existence of a\r\nreally fine lady. Her powers of conversation were boundless, her gift of\r\nrepartee unequalled, and her memory most extraordinary. She was the\r\ndaughter of Lady Clanricarde, celebrated for her conversational talents,\r\nand whom I remember Lady Carnarvon describing as “the most agreeable\r\nwoman in England, because she was not only massive, but lively.” Lady\r\nMargaret was like a little queen amongst her guests, entertaining with\r\nthe simplicity of real kindness and thoughtfulness for others, whilst\r\nher manner was equally agreeable to all, and she never usurped\r\nattention, but rather exerted herself to draw others out and to show the\r\nbest side of them. She could be alarming as an enemy, but she was a most\r\nfaithful friend, and would exert herself to take definite trouble for\r\nher friends, never deserting them unless they were proved to be really\r\nunworthy. She was not exactly pretty, but her animation was more\r\ncharming than mere beauty. Dress with her was not a mere adjunct, but\r\nwas made as much a thing of poetic beauty as a landscape or a flower.\r\nShe was devoted to her husband, but theoretically she disapproved of\r\nlove in a general way. Still she was only worldly in principle and not\r\nin practice, and she was ever a devoted mother to her children, seeking\r\ntheir real happiness rather than their advancement before the world.[27]\r\nI have often been at Bretton since my first visit there, and always\r\nenjoyed it from the constant animation which the hostess shed around\r\nher; the excessive comfort of the house and of the thoroughly\r\nwell-regulated household; the plenty of time for work and writing, and\r\nyet the constant variety afforded by the guests coming and going: while\r\nwith the children of the house I was very intimate, and with the\r\nyoungest, Hubert, long on terms of almost elder-brotherly affection.\r\nLady Francis Gordon was generally at Bretton when I have been there,\r\nrather an amusing than an agreeable person, but an immense talker. One\r\nof her first remarks to me was characteristic--“I am quite past the age\r\nof blushing: when I want to do anything of that kind, I what they call\r\n_flush_ now.” I have frequently seen Colonel Crealock[28] at Bretton,\r\nwho drew animals so splendidly. He told me once--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Old Lady Selby of the Mote at Ightham had been out to some grand party\r\nin all her diamonds and jewels. She slept in a room which still remains\r\nthe same, hung all round with tapestry representing events in the life\r\nof Julius Caesar. Through this room was the dressing-room, in which she\r\nkept her jewels and valuables. On the night of her return from the\r\nparty, as she was undressing and taking off her jewels, she looked up at\r\nthe figure of Julius Caesar in the tapestry, and thought she saw\r\nsomething peculiar in one of his eyes. She looked again, and felt sure\r\nthe eye moved. She quietly proceeded, however, to take off her jewels\r\nand put them away. Having done that, she locked the jewel-case, left it\r\nin the dressing-room, and went to bed.\r\n\r\n“She had not been in bed long when a man appeared in the room with a\r\ncandle and a knife. Coming up to the bed, he passed the light again and\r\nagain close before her eyes. She bore it without flinching in the least,\r\nonly appeared to become restless and turned over in her sleep. Then he\r\nproceeded to the dressing-room and became occupied over the jewels. As\r\nsoon as she was aware that he was entirely engrossed, she darted out of\r\nbed, banged to the door of the dressing-room, locked it on the outside,\r\nand rang violently for assistance. When help came, and the door was\r\nopened, they found the man strangled from trying to get through the iron\r\nbars of the window.\r\n\r\n“The portrait of old Lady Selby still remains at the Mote.”[29]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Bretton Park, Nov. 21, 1872._--To-day we went--Lady Francis Gordon,\r\nMrs. Lowther, Mr. Doyle, and I--to luncheon at Walton, an extraordinary\r\nhouse in the middle of a lake, which belonged to the Roman Catholic Mr.\r\nWaterton, the great ornithologist. It is approached by a long drawbridge\r\nand is most curious. A Mr. Hailstone lives there now, a strange man,\r\nwho spends his large fortune on antiquities, and has a wife who writes\r\non lace, and wonderful collections.[30] Their son has never eaten\r\nanything but buttered toast, cheese, and port-wine (has never tasted\r\nmeat, vegetables, or fruit), but is eight years old and very\r\nflourishing.\r\n\r\n“Lord and Lady Salisbury are here. The latter can only be described by\r\nthe word ‘jocund,’ except when she does not wish to make acquaintance or\r\ndesires to snub people, when she becomes hopelessly impenetrable. There\r\nis a party of fourteen, all new to me, but I get on very well. They look\r\nupon me as an aboriginal from another hemisphere, and indeed they are\r\nthat to me; but it is too new a set to feel the least shy in. There is\r\ngreat satisfaction in being only a _background_ figure, and Lady\r\nMargaret is quite charming, the house handsome, and the park pretty. We\r\nall went to church this morning in a sort of family drawing-room in the\r\ngrounds, the vulgar herd screened off by red curtains, only the\r\nclergyman in his pulpit visible above the screen.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI made a very interesting excursion with Lady Margaret and some of her\r\nguests to Haworth, the wild weird home of the Brontës on the Yorkshire\r\nfells, where the steep street with the stones placed edgeways, up which\r\nthe horses scramble like cats, leads to the wind-stricken churchyard,\r\nwith its vast pavement of tombstones set close together. On one side of\r\nthis is the dismal grey stone house where the three unhappy sisters\r\nlived, worked, and suffered, with the window at the side through which\r\nPatrick Brontë used to climb at night. Not a tree is to be seen in the\r\nneighbourhood except the blackened lilac before the Rectory door. Nature\r\nis her dreariest self, and offers no ameliorations. The family were\r\nburied beneath their pew in the church,[31] so that Charlotte, the last\r\nsurvivor, sat in church over the graves of her brothers and sisters. The\r\npeople seemed half savage, most of all the Rector, who violently hurled\r\nLady Margaret and Lady Catherine Weyland from his door when they asked\r\nto see the house, being bored, I suppose, by the pertinacity of\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\nThe Brontës were really Pronty--Irish--but when old Mr. Brontë went to\r\ncollege, he did the wise thing of changing his name, and the family kept\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nI went for two days from Bretton to Lord Houghton at Fryston, which has\r\nsince been burnt, but which was so filled with books of every kind that\r\nthe whole house was a library, each bookcase being filled with a\r\ndifferent subject--the French Revolution, Demonology and Witchcraft,\r\n&c., &c. Lady Houghton was living then, a most gentle, kind woman, a\r\nsister of Lord Crewe. From Lord Houghton I received constant kindness\r\nand protection from my first entering upon a literary life, and, in\r\nspite of his excessive vanity, I was always sincerely attached to him.\r\n“Butterfly to the hasty eye, he was firm in his friendships, firmest of\r\nall in his fearless championship of the weak, the strugglers, the\r\nundeservedly oppressed.” As Johnson says of Garth--“he communicated\r\nhimself through a very wide extent of acquaintance.” His conversation\r\nwas always interesting, but I have preserved scarcely any notes of my\r\nvisit to Fryston, and chiefly remember his mentioning that Sydney Smith\r\nhad said to him, what I have so often thought, “It is one of the great\r\nriddles of life to me why good people should always be so dreadfully\r\nstupid.” He also spoke of the many proverbs which discouraged exertion\r\nin “doing good,” from the Persian “Do no good, and no harm will come of\r\nit,” to the French--\r\n\r\n    “Pour faire du bien\r\n     Ne faites rien.”\r\n\r\nTalking of the Baroness Burdett Coutts, Lord Houghton said, “Miss\r\nCoutts likes me because I never proposed to her. Almost all the young\r\nmen of good family did: those who did their duty by their family\r\n_always_ did. Mrs. Browne (Miss Coutts’ companion) used to see it\r\ncoming, and took herself out of the way for ten minutes, but she only\r\nwent into the next room and left the door open, and then the proposal\r\ntook place, and immediately it was done Miss Coutts coughed, and Mrs.\r\nBrowne came in again.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 10, 1872._--Went to visit the Ralph Duttons at Timsbury near\r\nRomsey. The house is in a flat, and sees nothing but clipped laurel\r\nhedges. Mr. Dutton is a sporting politician: Mrs. Dutton a politician\r\ntoo, but _on the other side_. Both are full of pleasant conversation,\r\nand most kind. Regarding English country-houses, however, it is as\r\nCarlyle truly says, ‘Life may be as well spent there as elsewhere by the\r\nowners of them, who have occupations to attend to. For visitors, when\r\nlarge numbers are brought together, some practice is required if they\r\nare to enjoy the elaborate idleness.’\r\n\r\n“We drove to visit Mr. Cowper Temple at Broadlands--a pleasant liveable\r\nhouse with beautiful flowers and pictures, the most remarkable of the\r\nlatter being Guercino’s ‘Hagar and the Angel’--an angel which poises and\r\nfloats, and Sir J. Reynolds’ ‘Infant Academy’ and ‘Babes in the Wood.’\r\nIn Mr. Cowper Temple’s room upstairs is Edward Clifford’s family group\r\nof the ‘Maimed and Halt’ being called in to the feast, the figures being\r\nthose of the Cowper-Temples, Augustus Tollemaches, Lord Roden, Lady\r\nPalmerston, and Clifford’s favourite drummer. They are wonderful\r\nlikenesses, but it is a strange picture, with our Saviour looking in at\r\nthe window.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 13._--I arrived at Hatfield in the dark. A number of carriages\r\nfrom the house met the guests at the station. As I emerged from it, a\r\nlittle groom touched his hat and said, ‘Please, sir, are you the Lord\r\nChancellor?’ I thought I must have grown in dignity of aspect. The Lord\r\nChancellor was expected, and came later in the evening.\r\n\r\n“I found Lord and Lady Salisbury in the library, lined with Burleigh\r\nbooks and MSS. Mr. Richmond the artist was with them. He has the most\r\ncharming voice, which, quite independently of his conversation, would\r\nmake him agreeable. He talked of the enormous prices obtained for\r\nstatues and pictures at the present time, while Michelangelo only got\r\n£90 and a block of marble for the great David at Florence, and Titian\r\nthe same for his Assumption at Venice. He spoke of the amount of\r\nchicanery which existed amongst artists even then--how the monks, and\r\nthe nuns too, would supply them with good ultra-marine for their\r\nfrescoes, and how they would sell the ultra-marine and use smalt. He\r\ndescribed how Gainsborough never could sell anything but portraits:\r\npeople came to him for those, but would not buy his other pictures, and\r\nhis house was full of them when he died. Gainsborough gave two pictures\r\nto the carrier who brought his other pictures from Clifton to London:\r\nthe carrier would take no fare, so he painted his waggon and horses and\r\nanother picture and gave them to him: these two pictures have been sold\r\nlately for £18,000.\r\n\r\n“Besides the Lord Chancellor Selborne with his two pleasant unaffected\r\ndaughters, Miss Alderson was here the first day, and Sir Henry and Lady\r\nMaine. With the last I rambled in search of adventures in the evening,\r\nand we walked in the long gallery, which is splendid, with a gilt\r\nceiling, only it is incongruous to see the old panelled wall brilliantly\r\nlighted with gas.\r\n\r\n“Lord Salisbury is delightful, so perfectly easy and unaffected: it\r\nwould be well if little great men would take pattern by him. Lady\r\nSalisbury is equally unassuming, sound sense ever dropping from her lips\r\nas unconsciously as Lady Margaret Beaumont’s bon-mots.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 14._--Lady Salisbury showed us the house. In the drawing-room,\r\nover the chimney-piece, is a huge statue of James I. of bronze. It is\r\nnot fixed, but supported by its own weight. A ball was once given in\r\nthat room. In the midst of the dancing some one observed that the bronze\r\nstatue was slowly nodding its head, and gave the alarm. The stampede was\r\nfrightful. All the guests fled down the long gallery.\r\n\r\n“In the same room is a glorious portrait of Lord Salisbury’s grandmother\r\nby Reynolds. It was this Lady Salisbury who was burnt to death in her\r\nold age. She came in from riding, and used to make her maid change her\r\nhabit and dress her for dinner at once, as less fatiguing. Then she\r\nrested for two or three hours with lighted candles near her, and read or\r\nnodded in her chair. One evening, from the opposite wing of the house,\r\nthe late Lord Salisbury saw the windows of the rooms near hers blazing\r\nwith light, and gave the alarm, but before anybody could reach his\r\nmother’s rooms they were entirely burnt--so entirely, that it would have\r\nbeen impossible to identify her ashes for burial but for a ruby which\r\nthe present Lady Salisbury wears in a ring. A little heap of diamonds\r\nwas found in one place, but that proved nothing, as all her jewels were\r\nburned with her, but the ruby her maid identified as having put on her\r\nfinger when she dressed her, and the ashes of that particular spot were\r\nall gathered up and buried in a small urn. Her two favourite dogs were\r\nburnt with her, and they are probably buried with her.[32] It was this\r\nLady Salisbury who was inadvertently thrown down by a couple waltzing\r\nviolently down the long gallery, when Lord Lytton, who was present,\r\nirreverently exclaimed:\r\n\r\n    ‘At Hatfield House Conservatives\r\n     Become quite harum-scarum,\r\n     For Radical could do no more\r\n     Than overturn Old Sarum.’[33]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HATFIELD.]\r\n\r\n“In ‘Oliver Twist,’ Bill Sykes is described as having seen the fire at\r\nHatfield as he was escaping from London.\r\n\r\n“In the dining-room there is a portrait by Wilkie of the Duke of\r\nWellington, painted when he was here after the battle of Waterloo. There\r\nis also at Hatfield a beautiful picture of Mary Queen of Scots at\r\nfifteen.[34] This, however, is not the authentic portrait. There is\r\nanother, a replica of that at Hardwicke, taken in a widow’s dress\r\nshortly before her execution, which is one of the three portraits\r\ncertainly painted from life. It was sent by the Queen to the Duke of\r\nNorfolk and intercepted by Lord Burleigh. One of the other two\r\nportraits belonged to Louis Philippe. As Sir Henry Bulwer was waiting\r\nfor an audience of the king, another gentleman was in the room with him.\r\nThe portrait of Queen Mary hung on the wall. The stranger looked at it,\r\nwalked backwards and forwards to it, and examined it again and again. At\r\nlast he walked up to Sir Henry Bulwer and said, ‘Can you tell me, sir,\r\nwhom that portrait represents?’--‘Yes, I can,’ said Sir Henry; ‘but will\r\nyou tell me why you ask?’--‘Because it is the lowest type of criminal\r\nface which is known to us.’ The stranger was Fouché the famous\r\ndetective.\r\n\r\n“In Lady Salisbury’s own room is a picture of Miss Pine, Lord\r\nSalisbury’s other grandmother, by Sir Joshua; also the Earl and Countess\r\nof Westmoreland and their child, by Vandyke; also a curious picture of a\r\nlady.\r\n\r\n“‘She looks dull but good,’ said Miss Palmer.\r\n\r\n“‘She looks clever but bad,’ said I.\r\n\r\n“‘She _was_ desperately wicked,’ said Lady Salisbury, ‘and therefore it\r\nis quite unnecessary to say that she was very religious. She endowed\r\nalmshouses--‘Lady Anne’s Almshouses,’--they still exist, and she sent\r\nher son to Westminster with especial orders that he should be severely\r\nflogged, when he was seventeen, and so soured his temper for life and\r\nsent him to the bad entirely; and none but ‘a thoroughly\r\nhighly-principled woman’ could do such a villainous action as that. The\r\nson lived afterwards at Quixwold, and led the most abominably wicked\r\nlife there, and died a death as horrible as his life. He sold everything\r\nhe could lay hands on, jewels and everything, all the old family plate\r\nexcept one very ugly old flat candlestick and six old sconces, which\r\nwere painted over mahogany colour, and so were not known to be silver.\r\nHis is the phantom coach which arrives and drives up the staircase and\r\nthen disappears. Lord Salisbury heard it the other night when he was in\r\nhis dressing-room, and dressed again, thinking it was visitors, and went\r\ndown, but it was no one.’\r\n\r\n“There is a picture of Elizabeth by Zucchero in the famous dress, all\r\neyes and ears, to typify her omniscience, and with the serpent of wisdom\r\non her arm: she loved allegorical dress. Her hat is here--an open-work\r\nstraw hat--and in the recess of the gallery her cradle, with A. R. for\r\nAnne Boleyn. Elizabeth hated Hatfield. She was here in her childhood and\r\nall through Mary’s reign, and she constantly wrote from hence complaints\r\nto her father, to Mary, and to the Ministers, and they told her she must\r\nbear it; but she hated it, and after she became queen she never saw\r\nHatfield again. The relics of her remain because James I. was in such a\r\nhurry to exchange Hatfield for Theobalds, on account of the hunting\r\nthere, that he did not stop to take anything away.\r\n\r\n“In the afternoon we had games, charades--Pilgrim, Pirate, Scullion, and\r\nstories.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 15._--Breakfast at a number of little round tables. I was at one\r\nwith Miss Palmer, the Attorney-General, and his daughter Miss Coleridge.\r\nThe Attorney-General told a story of a Mr. Kerslake, who was 6 feet 8\r\ninches in height. A little boy in the Strand, looking up at him, said,\r\n‘I say, Maister, if you was to fall down, you’d be halfway t’ome.’\r\n\r\n“My cough prevented my going out, but we had Sunday-afternoon service in\r\nthe chapel, with beautiful singing. In the evening Lady Salisbury asked\r\nme to tell stories to all the party, and it was sufficiently alarming\r\nwhen I saw the Lord Chancellor in the first row, with the\r\nAttorney-General on one side of him and Lord Cairns on the other. In\r\nrepeating a story, however, I always think of a bit of advice Mr. Jowett\r\ngave me long ago--‘Try to say everything as well as you can say it.’ The\r\nAttorney-General afterwards told us--\r\n\r\n“There is at Clifton a Mr. Harrison, who is the second medical authority\r\nthere, a man of undoubted probity and reputation. He told me this.\r\n\r\n“At Clifton lived a Mrs. Fry with her brother-in-law and his two\r\ndaughters, Elizabeth and Hephzibah. These were persons who, like many\r\nBristol people, had large property in the West Indies--the Miles’s, for\r\ninstance, made their fortunes there. The elder daughter, Elizabeth, had\r\nbeen born in the West Indies, and when she fell into bad health, her\r\nfather took the opportunity of taking her back to benefit by her native\r\nair, when he went to look after his West Indian property, leaving his\r\nyounger daughter, Hephzibah, with Mrs Fry.\r\n\r\n“They had not been gone long when Hephzibah took a chill, and in a very\r\nfew days she died. Mr. Harrison attended her. Some days after he called\r\nas a friend upon Mrs. Fry, when she said, ‘I want to tell you something\r\nwhich has happened to me: I have seen Elizabeth.’--’ Impossible,’ said\r\nMr. Harrison. ‘No,’ she said, ‘it was so. I was sitting reading the\r\n“Promise”’ (so I believe ‘Friends’ always call the Bible), ‘when I fell\r\ninto a state which was neither sleeping nor waking, and in that state--I\r\nwas not asleep--I saw Elizabeth standing by me. I spoke to her, and,\r\nforgetting what had happened in my surprise, I told her to call her\r\nsister. But she said to me that she had seen her sister already, and\r\nthat she was in a box, and had a great deal of sewing about her chest.\r\nShe especially used the word “sewing:” then she vanished away, and the\r\nplace in the Promise where I had left off was changed: some one had\r\nturned it over.’ Mr. Harrison noted all this.\r\n\r\n“Some time after came a letter from the father to Mrs. Fry, written\r\nbefore he had heard of Hephzibah’s death. After speaking of other\r\nmatters he said, ‘I must now tell you of a very curious circumstance\r\nwhich has occurred, and which is much on my mind. The other day\r\nElizabeth, who had been much better, and who is now nearly well,\r\nsurprised us by falling into a stupor, and when she came to herself she\r\nwould insist upon it that she had been to Clifton, and that she had seen\r\nyou and Hephzibah, and that Hephzibah was in a long box, with a great\r\ndeal of sewing upon her chest: and she says so still.’ The dates were\r\nprecisely the same.\r\n\r\n“Hephzibah’s death was so sudden that there was a post-mortem\r\nexamination, though it was not considered necessary to distress Mrs. Fry\r\nby telling her of it. On this occasion Mr. Harrison was unable to be\r\npresent. He went afterwards to the student of the hospital who was\r\nthere, and who remembered all about it, and he said--what Mr. Harrison\r\nhad not previously known--that after the examination the body was sewn\r\nup, with a great deal of sewing upon the chest.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 16._--The Archbishop of Canterbury and Mrs. Tait arrived before\r\nafternoon-tea, at which there was much lively conversation. Apropos of\r\nRadicalism and the conversation of Bishops, Lord Salisbury mentioned\r\nSydney Smith’s saying that he would ‘rather fall a victim to a\r\ndemocratic mob than be sweetly and blandly absorbed by a bishop.’\r\n\r\n“In speaking of Jenny Lind, Mr. Richmond said that she had ‘none of the\r\nwarm ruddy glow of the sunny South in her character, it was rather the\r\nsoft calm beauty of Swedish moonlight.’ He spoke of the faces he had\r\ndrawn--of the interest of the ugly faces, if the lines had character; of\r\nthe difficulty of translating a face like a moon or a footstool; that\r\nstill such faces were quite the exception, and that he believed the\r\nreason why he succeeded better than some others of his confraternity was\r\nthat he was better able to realise to himself the good in the character\r\nof his subjects.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 17._--Mr. Richmond was at the same little table at breakfast. He\r\ntalked of great writers and talkers, how their art was not the creation\r\nof something new, but the telling of old things well in a new dress--the\r\nbringing up the thoughts long bedridden in the chambers of their own\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\n“He talked of Carlyle--of how his peculiarities began in affectation,\r\nbut that now he was simply lost in the mazes of his own vocabulary. One\r\nnight, he said, he met a man at Albert Gate at 12 P.M., who asked for a\r\nlight for his cigar. He did not see who it was till, as he was turning\r\naway, he recognised Carlyle, who gave a laugh which could be heard all\r\ndown Piccadilly as he exclaimed, ‘I thought it was just any son of Adam,\r\nand I find a friend.’ It was soon after the Pope’s return to Rome, and\r\nMr. Richmond spoke of him. ‘The poor old Pope,’ said Carlyle, ‘the\r\npo-o-r old Pope! He has a big mouth! I do not like your button-holes of\r\nmouths, like the Greek statues you are all so fond of.’\r\n\r\n“Our third at the breakfast-table was a Mr. Jeffreys. Mr. Richmond said\r\nafterwards that he was a conchologist, which he regarded as the very\r\ntail of science--the topmost twig of the tree looking up at the sky.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 19._--Yesterday I drew the gallery and chapel. There is something\r\nmediæval in the band playing all dinner-time, yet without the sound\r\nbeing overwhelming, from the great size of the room; in the way the host\r\nand hostess sit in the middle like royalty, and in the little lovely\r\nbaskets of hot-house flowers given to each lady as she goes down the\r\nstaircase to dinner.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 20._--The last collection of guests have included the Duke of\r\nWellington, the Cowleys, Lord and Lady Stanhope, and M. and Madame de\r\nLavalette--all full of interest. Certainly Hatfield is magnificent and\r\ngrandly kept up. I had much talk with Mrs. Lowe,[35] who delights in\r\ntirades against Christianity. She said how absurd it was to expect\r\nbelief in the Bible, when no one could agree upon so recent a subject as\r\nLord Byron: that half the Bible was contrary to all reason: that it was\r\nmonstrous to suppose that the Deity could enjoin a murder like that of\r\nIsaac, &c.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 27, East Sheen._--Mrs. Stuart Wortley came to luncheon. She\r\nremarked how that which was most striking in Italy was not the effect of\r\nlight, but of shadow. Into the shadows of England you could not\r\npenetrate, but the shadows of Italy were transparent; the more you\r\nlooked into their cavernous depths, the more you saw there, discovering\r\nmarvels of beauty which existed there in repose.\r\n\r\n“She told us that the secret of ‘the Haunted House in Berkeley Square’\r\nis that it belonged to a Mr. Du Pré of Wilton Park. He shut up his\r\nlunatic brother there in a cage in one of the attics, and the poor\r\ncaptive was so violent that he could only be fed through a hole. His\r\ngroans and cries could be distinctly heard in the neighbouring houses.\r\nThe house is now to be let for £100 the first year, £200 the second,\r\n£300 the third, but if the tenant leaves within that time, he is to\r\nforfeit £1000. The house will be furnished in any style or taste the\r\ntenant chooses.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo MISS WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Jan. 10, 1873._--I have had a pleasant visit at Battle\r\nAbbey. The Duchess (of Cleveland) received me very kindly. The house is\r\ncomfortable and the library is first-rate, and there is always a\r\npleasure in a house which has ruins, cloisters, haunted yew\r\nwalks--history, in fact--in its garden. The Duke, who is one of the few\r\nliving of my father’s old friends, was very cordial; and Lord and Lady\r\nStanhope, whom I am devoted to, arrived with me. The rest of the guests\r\nwere Harry Stanhope, a clergyman, Colonel and Mrs. Heygarth, Colonel and\r\nMrs. Byng, Mr. Newton the Lycian archæologist, Mr. Planché the Somerset\r\nHerald, and Mr. Campbell of Islay--a party which had plenty of good\r\nmaterials. We drew, acted, and all tried to make ourselves agreeable.\r\nThe Duchess was a perfect hostess, amused us all very much, and was\r\nintensely amused herself.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy book “Wanderings in Spain,” came out in the autumn of 1872, and met\r\nwith a more enthusiastic reception from the public than anything I have\r\never written. Three editions were called for in six weeks, but there the\r\nsale ended.[36] The reviews were rapturously laudatory, but I felt at\r\nthe time how little reliance was to be placed upon their judgment,\r\nthough for the moment it was agreeable. The _Times_ declared that no\r\none ought to go to Spain without the book; the _Athenæum_, that only in\r\none instance had pleasanter sketches fallen under its notice; while the\r\n_Spectator_ blew the loudest trumpet of all:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“In this least commonplace, and yet most comprehensive of works of\r\ntravel, we find everything we have previously learnt of that\r\ncomparatively unworked mine of history, art, poetry, and nature, Spain,\r\nas well as a great deal which is entirely novel. But the old is placed\r\nin a dazzling light of fancy, association, and suggestion, and the new\r\nis captivating. The skies of Spain shine, the wide-sweeping breezes\r\nblow, the solemn church music swells, the ancient grandeur, gravity, and\r\ndignity of the history and life of the country, the old Moorish\r\nmagnificence, the splendid chivalry, the religious enthusiasm, the stern\r\nloyalty and narrow pride of the races of Arragon and Castile, all live\r\nagain in the vivid pages of this book.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe unusual success which was attending my “Walks in Rome,” and the many\r\nnotes which I already possessed for a similar work in the neighbourhood,\r\nmade me now devote my time to “Days near Rome,” and in January I left\r\nEngland to make Rome a centre from whence to revive my recollection of\r\nthe towns I had already visited in the Campagna and its surrounding\r\nmountains, and to examine and sketch those I had not yet seen.\r\nAltogether, “Days near Rome” is the one of my books in the preparation\r\nof which I had the greatest enjoyment, and from which I have had least\r\ndisappointment since its publication.[37] I was, however, terribly ill\r\nsoon after my arrival at Rome, and nearly died there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Paris, Jan. 19, 1873._--I have felt most dolorous on the journey, and\r\noften repented having decided to come abroad: I so dread seeing Rome\r\nagain. Still, as last year I added £252 to my income by small writings\r\nexclusive of the ‘Memorials,’ I must look upon it as a profession, and\r\nof course as _such_ it is very pleasant. This morning I am cheered by\r\nGeorge Sheffield’s pleasure at seeing me, and I am going to dine with\r\nthe Comte and Comtesse de Clermont-Tonnerre.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Florence, Jan. 23._--All descriptions of ‘sensations’ in the Mont\r\nCenis tunnel must be pure imagination. It is exactly like any other\r\ntunnel. I came all the way from Paris with two American ladies, one of\r\nthem very handsome, but the sort of person who said, ‘I guess I am\r\ngenteelly well satisfied’ when she had finished her dinner, and that she\r\nhad read ‘Walks in Rome,’ which ‘was a very elegant book, a very elegant\r\nbook indeed.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIDENAE.][38]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_81 Via della Croce, Rome, Jan. 27._--I left Florence on a still,\r\nmizzly morning. How familiar all the dear places seemed on the way, and\r\nyet how changed the feeling with which one saw them--Thrasymene,\r\nPerugia, Assisi, Spoleto--all so much to _us_, so woven into _our_\r\nlives, and I was thankful for the twilight obscurity before the steep of\r\nFidenae rose beside us, and then the towers of the beloved city crested\r\nthe hill, the hill down which my darling drove so often in her little\r\ncarriage to the Ponte Salario and the Ponte Nomentano, drinking in the\r\nfull beauty of the historic loveliness. On Saturday I removed to these\r\nrooms in the house of Voight, a German artist, much beloved by the\r\nBunsens, and indeed married to his old still-existing Signora from their\r\nhouse. I think that the rooms will answer sufficiently, though, as the\r\nVoights have never let rooms before, there is a terrible amount of\r\ntalking over everything I need. The whole family, of three generations,\r\nwere called into council the first time I desired to have an egg for\r\nbreakfast, and then it came in raw, and yesterday the scene was\r\nrepeated. However, ‘_pazienza_.’\r\n\r\n“On Sunday I went up first to the Pincio, and I cannot say--indeed no\r\none could understand--all that that walk is to me, where day after day,\r\nfor so many feeble winters, we helped my darling along; whence she\r\nlooked down upon the windows so sacred to her in the San Sebastianello;\r\nwhere every shrub was familiar and commented upon, as not even those in\r\nthe garden at Holmhurst have ever been. Nothing has been more _our_\r\ngarden. It seemed almost sacrilege to see the changes, and they are not\r\nmany. In the afternoon I went again with my old friend Stopford\r\nSackville.\r\n\r\n“It has been a great effort--a gasp--coming here, but I am thankful now\r\nthat I came. There is something in the simple greetings of all our poor\r\nfriends--‘Lei stá solo adesso--ahi poverino!’--far more to me than\r\nanything else could be, and the very trees and ruins talk to me, only\r\nthat as _she_ saw her Augustus’s, so I see my Mother’s name engraven on\r\nevery stone. In some ways I seem every day to make fresh acquaintance\r\nwith my solitary life.\r\n\r\n“It is perfect summer here, the Villa Doria a sheet of flowers, anemones\r\nof every hue, violets almost over. ‘How full of sources of comfort has\r\nGod made this lovely woe-world,’ as Mrs. Kemble says.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 1._--I have been very ill for the last three days with Roman\r\nfever, which has brought on a violent return of my cough. It all came\r\nfrom going out for one _instant_ upon the balcony at night without extra\r\nclothing: in that instant I felt the seizure like a stab, and the most\r\nviolent shivering fits came on immediately. Perhaps the chill of these\r\nrooms has something to do with it. I feel much the absence of the\r\nsympathising help I have had here in illness before, especially of Lea’s\r\ngood food and attentions; and now, if I ask even for a cup of tea, the\r\ncommotion is enough to bring the house down.... I am especially sorry to\r\nbe shut up at this time, as there are so many pleasant people in Rome,\r\nnot least the really charming Prince Arthur, to whom I was presented the\r\nother day, and whom I think most engaging, and hope--if I can only get\r\nbetter--to see more of next week, when I have been asked, and have\r\npromised, to go with him to several sights. Amongst his suite is Sir\r\nHoward Elphinstone, a capital artist, who is quite a friend of mine, and\r\nwent out drawing with me before I was taken ill.\r\n\r\n“The _old_ interest of Rome has wonderfully passed away, not only to me,\r\nbut I think also to many others. The absence of pope, cardinals, and\r\nmonks; the shutting up of the convents; the loss of the ceremonies; the\r\nmisery caused by the terrible taxes and conscription; the voluntary\r\nexile of the Borgheses and many other noble families; the total\r\ndestruction of the glorious Villa Negroni and so much else of interest\r\nand beauty; the ugly new streets in imitation of Paris and New York, all\r\ngrate against one’s former Roman associations. And to set against this\r\nthere is so very little--a gayer Pincio, a live wolf on the Capitol, a\r\nmere scrap of excavation in the Forum, and all is said.\r\n\r\n“Old Beppino (the beggar of the Trinità steps) escaped from a bad\r\naccident the other day and announced it thus--‘Ho mancato póco d’andare\r\nin Paradiso, che Dio me ne guarda!’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Il Tempietto, Feb. 4._--Since I last wrote I have been terribly ill.\r\nOn Friday night I was seized with feverish convulsions, and with loss of\r\nspeech for four hours. The first night I was too ill to call for any\r\nhelp, but next morning kind Dr. Grigor came, and I decided to forfeit\r\nthe rent of my other rooms and move up here to our dear old apartment,\r\nhaving more than ever the immoral conviction I have always had, that one\r\nnever does anything economical without doing something very foolish\r\nalso. These dear rooms have all their old homelike charm. I sit in the\r\nMother’s chair with her little table by my side, and Madame da Monaca,\r\nour old landlady, is perfectly charmed to have me back.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 9._--I have still some sparks of life in me, which really two\r\ndays ago I did not feel, it has been such a suffering illness and the\r\ncough has quite worn me out. I am sure, in thinking of dangerous illness\r\nhenceforward, I shall always remember the long nights here, nights of\r\npain and fever, tossing restlessly and longing for the morning, and\r\nfirst knowing it had dawned by the tinkling bells of the goats coming to\r\nbe milked under the windows, followed by the familiar cry of--\r\n\r\n    ‘Acqua Acetosa\r\n     Buona per la sposa.’\r\n\r\n“Charlie Dalison, who has been in Rome, has been most kind, and the\r\nArchbishop of Dublin and Mrs. Trench, living just underneath, have been\r\nincessant in their attentions. Endless little comforts have also been\r\nsupplied to me by the constant kindness of two ladies who live together,\r\nMiss Freeman Clarke, an American authoress, who has visited all the\r\nplaces in Italy connected with Dante, and drawn and described them; and\r\nMiss Foley, a most charming young sculptress, as clever as she is\r\nattractive.”[39]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 16._--Last week I felt as if life was really passing away--such\r\nwas my utter exhaustion and suffering.... After a most kind touching\r\nnote about the ‘Memorials,’ I have had an hour’s visit from Lord\r\nChichester, and he is coming again often. I constantly see Lady\r\nAshburton, who rains her benefits upon me. I am doing all I can to be\r\nable to go out with the Prince soon, having put him off again and again\r\nwith a greater pang each time, but I wish I could feel a little less\r\ndreadfully weak.\r\n\r\n“I think the ‘Memorials’ will soon reach a sale like that of the _Récit\r\nd’une Sœur_. Hatchard is pushing the ‘Alton Sermons’ under its\r\nshadow. ‘Wanderings in Spain’ also sells beyond all expectation.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW FROM THE TEMPIETTO, ROME.]\r\n\r\nIt was on the 18th of February that I was first able to have one of my\r\nlectures for Prince Arthur. It was arranged for the Palace of the\r\nCæsars. I had asked him if Lady Ashburton and her daughter might go with\r\nus, and to this he had consented. Lady Ashburton insisted upon coming\r\nto fetch me, but, knowing her unpunctual habits, I was most unwilling\r\nshe should do so. Nothing else would serve her, however, and she\r\npromised again and again to be punctual. However, the time came and she\r\ndid not arrive. Having secured no other carriage I waited minute after\r\nminute in an agony, and not till after the time at which we ought to\r\nhave been at the Palatine did Lady Ashburton appear on the Pincio. When\r\nwe reached the Palatine, the Prince and all his suite were still in the\r\nroad, unable to enter without my order. “I have been waiting ten\r\nminutes,” he said, “and they wouldn’t let me in.” It was a terrible\r\nbeginning. However, his lively pleasure and active interest in all that\r\nwas to be seen soon made me at home with him. If anything especial\r\nattracted his notice, he generally asked, “Do you think my brother and\r\nsister (the Prince and Princess of Wales) saw this?”\r\n\r\nA few days after, I had another lecture for the Prince on the Cœlian.\r\nThis time I refused altogether to go with Lady Ashburton, and when I\r\narrived ten minutes before the time at the steps of S. Gregorio, found\r\nthat she had already been there half-an-hour, walking up and down in the\r\ndew! This time the Prince was even pleasanter than before. Generally he\r\nbegged that his name might not be mentioned, but this was necessary to\r\nget into the garden of SS. Giovanni e Paolo, which at that time was\r\nalways closed. While we were in the church, a monk came up to me and\r\nsaid that the General of the Passionists was coming to pay his respects\r\nto the Prince. I said, “Sir, the General of the Passionists is coming to\r\nhave the honour of being presented to you.” The Prince began to say “No,\r\nno, no,” but at that moment the white robes of the abbot appeared in the\r\ndoorway, followed by a whole train of monks. The Prince immediately did\r\nthe right thing, receiving them and speaking to them on the steps of the\r\ntribune, and I have often thought what a picture the scene would have\r\nmade. In the shadow of royalty, Lady Ashburton was the first woman\r\nallowed to visit the Passionist garden, but to the Prince’s great\r\nannoyance, three Americans (probably not knowing who it was) got in too,\r\nby pretending to belong to our party. They followed us afterwards to the\r\nVilla Mattei. The Prince then asked Lady Ashburton to sit down near the\r\nentrance, and we raced up and down the walks, with the Americans\r\ncantering after us, and eventually slipped under one of the high box\r\nhedges, returned by the concealed way, snapped up Lady Ashburton, and\r\nescaped from the Villa, the gates of which were locked behind us; and\r\nhow those Americans got out I have never known.\r\n\r\nI was truly sorry when the Prince went away to Naples. He sent me from\r\nthence some friends of his--Colonel Crichton and his most sweet wife\r\nLady Madeleine (a daughter of Lord Headfort, who has died since), and\r\nasked me to do what I could for them. I knew that this meant lectures of\r\nthe same kind which I had given for the Prince himself, and thus was\r\noriginated my long course of Roman lectures.\r\n\r\nAt one of my lectures at the Palace of the Cæsars a curious thing\r\nhappened. We were about forty in number, and I had taken my company all\r\nover the palace, explaining and telling the story of the different rooms\r\nas we went. Finally, as was my habit, I assembled them on the slope\r\ntowards the Forum for a sort of recapitulation and final discourse on\r\nall we had seen. I had observed a stranger who had attached himself to\r\nour party looking more and more angry every minute, but the “why” I\r\ncould not understand. When I had concluded, the stranger stepped\r\nforward, and in a very loud voice addressed the whole party--“Gentlemen\r\nand ladies, it is not my habit to push myself forward, and it is\r\nexcessively painful to me to do it on the present occasion; but there\r\nare some things which no gentleman ought to pass unnoticed. All that\r\nthis _person_ has been telling you about the Palace of the Cæsars, he\r\nhas had the effrontery to relate to you as if it were his own. You will\r\nbe astounded, gentlemen and ladies, to hear that it is taken, word for\r\nword--word for _word_, without the slightest acknowledgment, from Mr.\r\nHare’s ‘Walks in Rome!’”\r\n\r\nI only said, “Oh, I am _so_ much obliged to you. I did not know there\r\nwas anybody in the world who would defend my interests so kindly. I am\r\nAugustus Hare.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_TO_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Il Tempietto, Rome, March 9, 1873._--I am much better, but still have\r\nfever every three days. The weather is glorious, and Miss Wright, who\r\narrived ten days ago, is revelling in the hot sunshine.\r\n\r\n“On Monday we had an enchanting expedition to Veii; there were twelve\r\nriders and five carriages. I went with Miss Baring[40] and her\r\ngoverness, and we had quite a banquet near the waterfall, with the old\r\ncastle of Isola Farnese opposite, and the woods around us carpeted with\r\ncyclamen, violets, and blue and white anemones, while the cliffs were\r\nsnow-drifted with laurustinus. After luncheon, the adventurous part of\r\nthe company, the Sackvilles, Miss Wright, &c., went on with me to the\r\nPonte Sodo and the painted tombs--_such_ a hot walk through the woods,\r\nbut we came back to Rome before sunset.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ISOLA FARNESE.][41]\r\n\r\n“At the end of this week I have a lecture on the Christian history of\r\nthe Trastevere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VALLEY OF SUBIACO.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PONTE DELL’ ISOLA, VEII.][42]\r\n\r\n“I think a Republic here will soon follow that of Spain. Victor Emmanuel\r\nis so hated, and the profligacy of the Court and the cruel taxes are\r\nhastening the end. People already shout ‘Viva la Republica’ and bawl\r\nGaribaldian hymns all night. I wonder whether you would think the\r\nfreedom of religious worship a compensation for the moral changes\r\nhere--the shops always open on Sundays, which were formerly so strictly\r\nclosed, the churches deserted, stalls for infidel books in the streets,\r\nand an ostentatious immorality which was formerly unknown. In the\r\nCarnival, in insulting reference to the Pope, a pasteboard dome of St.\r\nPeter’s was made to travel up and down the Corso in a car, with a\r\nparrot imprisoned in a cage on the top, ‘_pappagallo_’ being Italian for\r\na parrot, and ‘Papa Gallo’ a nickname given to Pio Nono during the\r\nFrench occupation. The parrot struggled and fluttered through the first\r\nday, but it died of sea-sickness in the evening, and afterwards it\r\nappeared stuffed. The Pope has felt bitterly the confiscation of the\r\nconvents and other religious institutions which the Sardinian\r\nGovernment, when it first entered Rome, promised so strictly to respect;\r\nand _triduos_ have been held at St. Peter’s and at S. Ignazio to implore\r\nthat the spoliation may be averted, or that a judgment may follow the\r\nspoiler. In St. Peter’s twenty thousand persons were collected on Sunday\r\nafternoon to join with one voice in this supplication. Pius IX. took no\r\npart in the manifestation: on Sunday afternoon he is quietly occupied as\r\na bishop in the Sala Regia, in explaining the Epistle and Gospel for\r\nthe day, and praying with the people of the different Roman parishes,\r\nwho come to him in turn, attended by their priests. Amongst the nuns who\r\nhave suffered most are the Poor Clares of S. Lorenzo Panisperna, who,\r\nwhen they were driven out of the greater part of their convent in\r\nFebruary 1872, were allowed to retain and fit up a few small rooms, from\r\nwhich they are now forcibly ejected altogether. The nuns of S. Antonio\r\non the Esquiline, who plaited all the palms used in the processions at\r\nSt. Peter’s, were driven out more than a year ago, though their convent\r\nhas never hitherto been used for anything else. The nuns of S. Giacomo\r\nalla Lungara are reduced to absolute beggary. The Carmelites of S. Maria\r\nVittoria have been driven out, and their Superior died of a broken heart\r\non the day of their ejection. The nuns of S. Teresa, when driven out of\r\ntheir convent, were permitted to take refuge in that of Regina Cœli,\r\nwhere they were allowed to fit up a corridor with canvas partitions: now\r\nthey are driven out again, in spite of solemn promises, and without any\r\ncompensation. If the dowries of all these ladies, given to them by their\r\nparents exactly as marriage portions are given, were restored,\r\ncomparatively little could be said, but their fortunes are all\r\nconfiscated by the Government. A pitiful allowance is promised, just\r\nsufficient to keep body and soul together, but even this is seldom paid;\r\nfor instance, in the case of the nuns of S. Teresa, the ‘_assegno_’ for\r\nthe first half of 1871 was not paid till October 1872, and since then\r\nnothing has been paid. In the same way it is supposed that the\r\nconventual buildings and gardens are paid for at a valuation, yet the\r\nreal value of those of the Cappuccini, in one of the most important\r\nsituations of the town, is £40,000, and it is expropriated at 4000\r\nfrancs (£160), while even this is to be paid in paper and at great\r\nintervals of time. Amongst the last institutions seized are the Orphan\r\nAsylum of the Quattro Incoronati, and the Conservatorio Pio, an especial\r\nand beloved institution of Pio Nono, intended as a school for servants\r\nand for instructing young girls in household work.[43]\r\n\r\n“The heads of the clerical schools have inquired from Pius IX. whether\r\ntheir pupils were to salute Queen Margaret when she passed them.\r\n‘Certainly,’ answered the Pope; ‘is she not a member of the royal house\r\nof Savoy?’\r\n\r\n“There is a stall for Bibles now opposite S. Carlo. A great dog manages\r\nit, such a fine beast. He cannot be expected to do all the business, so\r\nhe just receives the customers, and, when any one wants a Bible, he puts\r\nhis feet up and barks.\r\n\r\n“I am very glad to hear of Sir George Grey having given the ‘Memorials’\r\nto the Queen, and I have a most kind letter from Lord Stanhope,\r\ndelighted with ‘Wanderings in Spain.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March_ 17.--Yesterday I drove with Lady Ashburton to Castel Fusano;\r\nMiss Wright, Miss Howard, and Walter Jekyll going in another carriage,\r\nand we picnicked under the grand old pine-trees, and had a delicious\r\nday, wandering through the labyrinths of sweet daphne and rosemary, and\r\nover carpets of cyclamen in fullest bloom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASTEL FUSANO.][44]\r\n\r\n“I have had several more lectures. There was a party of forty, which is\r\nthe largest I can manage, at the one on the Early Christian Church in\r\nthe Trastevere. We met on the Island, where I gave a sort of preliminary\r\ndiscourse, and led my troop to everything connected with the Christian\r\nmartyrs. To-morrow I have the same kind of lecture on the Esquiline.\r\nMrs. Locke and her pretty charming little grand-daughter[45]\r\nunexpectedly joined us at S. Cecilia, and seemed much interested, never\r\nhaving visited the Roman sights before. I dined with them last night--an\r\nexceptionally pleasant party, as Mrs. Locke, the Duchess, and the little\r\nCountess move about constantly all evening, and do their utmost to amuse\r\ntheir guests, unlike most stiff Italian hostesses. They seem to me to\r\nhave three grades of beauty, the grandmother’s being the highest.”\r\n\r\n“_14 Trinità de’ Monti, March 29._--There are many quiet hours here,\r\nsuch as one gets nowhere else, and yet endless society of the most\r\ninteresting kind; troops of visitors of every sort, and what contrasts\r\nthose of a single day furnish--Madama de Bonis at breakfast, for help\r\nwith her photographs; then Rosina the poor donna; then Lady Howard de\r\nWalden and a daughter; then Signor Monachesi, the Italian master; then\r\nthe Marchese Carcolo, fresh from Perugia; then three ugly old ladies,\r\nwhose names I failed to discover, who wanted to be told where to live,\r\nhow to live, and what to live upon; then Mrs. Foljambe from Villa\r\nSavorelli; then Signor Altini the sculptor, to ask for recommendations:\r\nand this is only an ordinary Roman day, yet I cannot feel it is a\r\n_useless_ life.”\r\n\r\n“_Albano, April 6._--Yesterday, after dining with Mrs. Lockwood, I went\r\nto meet Princess Alice at the S. Arpinos’. They have a beautiful suite\r\nof rooms in the Bonaparte Palace, the same in which ‘Madame Mère’ died.\r\nMany ambassadors and Roman princes and princesses were there, but only\r\nfive English. I was presented at once to Prince Louis, who is very\r\nGerman and speaks very broken English, but is much better-looking than\r\nhis photographs. He talked for a long time about Rome and my book. Later\r\nin the evening I was presented to the Princess. She said at once, ‘Oh, I\r\nknow your face, I have seen you before,’ and with royal memory\r\nrecollected all about coming to see my Mother, &c. She said, ‘I have\r\ngone about everywhere with your book, and I am so pleased to be able to\r\nsay that I have found out a mistake in it: you say that the church at\r\nthe Navicella was designed by Michelangelo, and it was not; it was\r\ndesigned by Raffaelle: I know all about it, for my dear father had the\r\noriginal plan and sketch for it. My dear father always took a great\r\ninterest in the Navicella. I have been to see the martyrdoms at S.\r\nStefano: they are quite shocking.’ She talked for some time, then some\r\none else was brought up. She is grown much fatter and prettier, and was\r\nvery simply dressed in high slate-coloured silk with a pearl necklace.\r\nWe all stayed till she left at 11 P.M., and then made an avenue down the\r\nreception rooms, through which she passed, saying a little separate word\r\nto each lady.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Locke[46] said Princess Margherita was deep in ‘Walks in\r\nRome,’[47] and had desired her to get me to tell _her_ (Mrs. Locke) a\r\nghost-story, and then come and retail it immediately!\r\n\r\n“Yesterday I went with Lady Howard and her daughter and Miss Wright to\r\nTusculum and Frascati. I never saw the Villa Mondragone before. How\r\n_very_ grand it is, and the view was exquisitely lovely--such blue\r\nshadows cast by the clouds upon the pink campagna. All the ascent to\r\nTusculum was fringed with cyclamen, large purple violets, laurustinus,\r\nand blue and white anemones, also the loveliest little blue squills.\r\n\r\n“On Wednesday I met Miss Wright and Miss Howard at Albano, and we had an\r\ninteresting afternoon amongst the huge Cyclopean remains of Alatri,\r\ndriving on in the beautiful gloaming to Ferentino, where we slept at a\r\nprimitive but clean Italian tavern. The next day we reached Segni, a\r\nPelasgic city on the very highest peak of the Volscian mountains. On\r\nFriday I joined Lady Howard de Walden and her two daughters, and with\r\nthem revisited the glorious old Papal citadel of Anagni, where Boniface\r\nVIII. was imprisoned, and where there are many relics of him, though to\r\nme Anagni has an even deeper interest, because from its walls you can\r\nsee, on the barren side of the mountain, the brown building of Acuto,\r\nwhere my sister’s revered friend Maria di Matthias preached the sermons\r\nwhich had such an extraordinary influence throughout this wild\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CYCLOPEAN GATE OF ALATRI.][48]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Subiaco, April 16._--We spent Good Friday on the seashore at Porto\r\nd’Anzio, a delightful place, overgrown with gorgeous pink\r\nmesembryanthemum, and with huge remains of Nero’s palace projecting far\r\ninto the sea. For Easter we were at Velletri, and on Monday drove\r\nthrough the blooming country to Cori, where, after seeing the beautiful\r\ntemple, we rode along the edge of stupendous precipices to Norba, and\r\nthe man-deserted flower-possessed fairy-like town of Ninfa, returning\r\nby the light of the stars--‘le Ninfe eterne’ of Dante. Tuesday we went\r\nto Palestrina, an extraordinary place with a perfectly savage\r\npopulation; and Wednesday we came hither through Olevano, which is a\r\nparadise of beauty. This place seems quite as grandly beautiful as we\r\nthought it fifteen years ago.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE INN AT FERENTINO.][49]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Rome, April 28._--I parted with my kind Miss Wright at Tivoli, and\r\nnext day returned to Rome in the public omnibus.”[50]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAPAL PALACE, ANAGNI.][51]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEMPLES OF CORI.][52]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NINFA.][53]\r\n\r\nA few days later I left Rome again with Mr. and Mrs. Arbuthnot Feilden\r\nand the Misses Crawford (daughters of Mrs. Terry, and sisters of Marion\r\nCrawford) for a tour in the Ciminian Hills, which always comes back to\r\nme as a dream of transcendent loveliness.\r\n\r\nWe left the railway at Civita Castellana, an unspeakably beautiful\r\nplace, which I drew in the early dewy morning, sitting on the edge of\r\nits tremendous rocky gorge, above which Soracte, steeped in violet\r\nshadows, rises out of the tender green of the plain. On May-day we\r\nascended Soracte, queen of lovely mountains, mounting gradually from the\r\nrich lower slopes into the excelsior of olives, and thence to steeps of\r\nbare grey rock, crowned--in the most sublime position--by the ruined\r\nmonastery of S. Silvestro. It is the most exquisite drive from Civita\r\nCastellana, by Nepi, with a great machicolated castle overhanging a\r\nfoaming waterfall, and Sutri--“the key of Etruria”--with its solemn\r\nRoman amphitheatre surrounded by some of the grandest ilexes in the\r\nworld, to Ronciglione. Hence we visited Caprarola, and I will insert a\r\nlittle extract from “Days near Rome” about this expedition, it reminds\r\nme of so wondrously beautiful and delightful a day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S. ORESTE, FROM SORACTE.][54]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“From the little deep-blue lake of Vico it is a long ascent, and oh!\r\nwhat Italian scenery, quite unspoilt by the English, who never come here\r\nnow. The road is generally a dusty hollow in the tufa, which, as we\r\npass, is fringed with broom in full flower, and all the little children\r\nwe meet have made themselves wreaths and gathered long branches of it,\r\nand wave them like golden sceptres. Along the brown ridges of thymy\r\ntufa by the wayside, flocks of goats are scrambling, chiefly white, but\r\na few black and dun-coloured creatures are mingled with them, mothers\r\nwith their little dancing elf-like kids, and old bearded patriarchs who\r\nlove to clamber to the very end of the most inaccessible places, and to\r\nstand there embossed against the clear sky, in triumphant quietude. The\r\nhandsome shepherd dressed in white linen lets them have their own way,\r\nand the great rough white dogs only keep a lazy eye upon them as they\r\nthemselves lie panting and luxuriating in the sunshine. Deep down below\r\nus, it seems as if all Italy were opening out, as the mists roll\r\nstealthily away, and range after range of delicate mountain distance is\r\ndiscovered. Volscian, Hernican, Sabine, and Alban hills, Soracte nobly\r\nbeautiful--rising out of the soft quiet lines of the Campagna, and the\r\nTiber winding out of the rich meadow-lands into the desolate wastes,\r\ntill it is lost from sight before it reaches where a great mysterious\r\ndome rises solemnly through the mist, and reminds one of the times when,\r\nyears ago, in the old happy _vetturino_ days, we used to stop the\r\ncarriage on this very spot, to have our first sight of St. Peter’s.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONVENT OF S. SILVESTRO, SUMMIT OF SORACTE.][55]\r\n\r\n“Near a little deserted chapel, a road branches off on the right, a\r\nrough stony road enough, which soon descends abruptly through chestnut\r\nwoods, and then through deep clefts cut in the tufa and overhung by\r\nshrubs and flowers, every winding a picture, till in about half-an-hour\r\nwe arrive at Caprarola. Why do not more people come here? it is so very\r\neasy. As we emerge from our rocky way, the wonderful position of the\r\nplace bursts upon us at once. The grand, tremendous palace stands backed\r\nby chestnut woods, which fade into rocky hills, and it looks down from a\r\nhigh-terraced platform upon the little golden-roofed town beneath, and\r\nthen out upon the whole glorious rainbow-tinted view, in which, as\r\neverywhere we have been, lion-like Soracte, couching over the plain, is\r\nthe most conspicuous feature. The buildings are so vast in themselves,\r\nand every line so noble, every architectural idea so stupendous, that\r\none is carried back almost with awe to the recollections of the\r\ngreat-souled Farnese who originated the design, and the grand architect\r\nwho carried it out. S. Carlo Borromeo, the great patron of idle\r\nalmsgiving, came hither to see it when it was completed, and complained\r\nthat so much money had not been given to the poor instead. ‘I have let\r\nthem have it all little by little,’ said Alessandro Farnese, ‘but I have\r\nmade them earn it by the sweat of their brows.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUTRI.][56]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Are we really in Arcadia, when the old steward opens the door from the\r\ndark halls where the Titanic forms of the frescoed figures loom upon us\r\nthrough the gloom, to the garden where the brilliant sunshine is\r\nlighting up long grass walks between clipped hedges, adding to the\r\nsplendour of the flame-coloured marigolds upon the old walls, and even\r\ngilding the edges of the dark spires of the cypresses which were planted\r\nthree hundred years ago? From the upper terraces we enter an ancient\r\nwood, carpeted with flowers--yellow orchis, iris, lilies, saxifrage,\r\ncyclamen, and Solomon’s seal. And then we pause, for at the end of the\r\navenue we meet with a huge figure of Silence, with his finger on his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPRAROLA.][57]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAPAL PALACE, VITERBO.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Here an artificial cascade tumbles sparkling down the middle of the\r\nhillside path, through a succession of stone basins, and between a\r\nnumber of stone animals, who are sprinkled with its spray, and so we\r\nreach an upper garden before the fairy-like casino which was also built\r\nby Vignola. Here the turfy solitudes are encircled with a concourse of\r\nstone figures in every variety of attitude, a perfect population. Some\r\nare standing quietly gazing down upon us, others are playing upon\r\ndifferent musical instruments, others are listening. Two Dryads are\r\nwhispering important secrets to one another in a corner; one impertinent\r\nFaun is blowing his horn so loudly into his companion’s ears that he\r\nstops them with both his hands. A nymph is about to step down from her\r\npedestal, and will probably take a bath as soon as we are gone, though\r\ncertainly she need not be shy about it, as drapery is not much the\r\nfashion in these sylvan gardens. Above, behind the Casino, is yet\r\nanother water-sparkling staircase guarded by a vast number of huge lions\r\nand griffins, and beyond this all is tangled wood and rocky\r\nmountain-side. How we pity the poor King and Queen of Naples, the actual\r\npossessors, but who can never come here now. The whole place is like a\r\ndream which you wish may never end, and as one gazes through the stony\r\ncrowd across the green glades to the rosy-hued mountains, one dreads the\r\nreturn to a world where Fauns and Dryads are still supposed to be\r\nmythical, and which has never known Caprarola.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM THE WALLS OF ORVIETO.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe spent several days at Viterbo--“the city of beautiful\r\nfountains”--which has never been half appreciated by travellers, and\r\nmade many curious excursions into Etruria, which are all described in my\r\nbook; and then proceeded to Orvieto--all-glorious Orvieto. Once more I\r\nwill quote “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Long before reaching Orvieto, one comes in sight of it. It occupies an\r\nEtruscan site. On turning the crest of the hills which shelter Bolsena,\r\none looks down into a wide valley filled with the richest\r\nvegetation,--peach-trees and almonds and figs, with vines leaping from\r\ntree to tree and chaining them together, and beneath, an unequalled\r\nluxuriance of corn and peas and melons, every tiniest space occupied.\r\nMountains of the most graceful forms girdle in this paradise, and, from\r\nthe height whence we first gaze upon it, endless distances are seen,\r\nblue and roseate and snowy, melting into infinity of space; while, from\r\nthe valley itself, rises, island-like, a mass of orange-coloured rock,\r\ncrowned with old walls and houses and churches, from the centre of which\r\nis uplifted a vast cathedral, with delicate spray-like pinnacles, and a\r\ngolden and jewelled front,--and this is Orvieto.\r\n\r\n“The first impression is one which is never forgotten,--a picture which\r\nremains; and the quiet grandeurs of the place, as time and acquaintance\r\nbring it home to one, only paint in the details of that first picture\r\nmore carefully.\r\n\r\n“We descend into the plain by the winding road, where wains of great\r\noxen are always employed for the country-work of the hillside, and we\r\nascend the hill on which the city stands and enter it by a gate in rocky\r\nwalls. The town is remarkably clean, but one has always the feeling of\r\nbeing in a fortress. Unlike Viterbo, gaiety and brightness seem to have\r\ndeserted its narrow streets of dark houses, interspersed with huge tall\r\nsquare towers of the Middle Ages, and themselves, in the less frequented\r\nparts, built of rich brown stone, with sculptured cornices to their\r\nmassive doors and windows, and resting on huge buttresses. From one of\r\nthe narrowest and darkest of these streets we come suddenly upon the\r\ncathedral, a blaze of light and colour, the most aërial gothic structure\r\nin the world, every line a line of beauty. There is something in the\r\nfeeling that no artists worked at this glorious temple but the greatest\r\narchitects, the greatest sculptors of their time, that no material was\r\nused but that which was most precious, most costly, and which would\r\nproduce the most glorious effect, which carries one far away from all\r\ncomparisons with other earthly buildings--to the description in the\r\nRevelation of the New Jerusalem. The very platform on which the\r\ncathedral stands is of purple Apennine marble; the loveliest jaspers and\r\n_pietre dure_ are worked into its pinnacles and buttresses; the main\r\nfoundation of its pictured front is gold. A hundred and fifty-two\r\nsculptors, of whom Arnolfo and Giovanni da Pisa are the greatest names\r\nhanded down to us, worked upon the ornamentation near the base:\r\nsixty-eight painters and ninety workers in mosaic gave life to the\r\nglorious pictures of its upper stories. All the surroundings are\r\nharmonious--solemn old houses, with black and white marble seats running\r\nalong their basement, on which one may sit and gaze: a tower surmounted\r\nby a gigantic bronze warrior, who strikes the hours with the clash of\r\nhis sword upon a great bell: an ancient oblong palace with gothic arches\r\nand flat windows, where thirty-four popes have sought a refuge or held\r\na court at different times--all serving as a dark setting to make more\r\nresplendent the glittering radiancy of the golden front of the temple in\r\ntheir midst.\r\n\r\n“No passing traveller, no stayer for one night, can realise Orvieto.\r\nHours must be passed on those old stone benches, hours in reading the\r\nwondrous lessons of art, of truth, of beauty and of holiness which this\r\ntemple of temples can unfold. For Orvieto is not merely a vast\r\nsculpture-gallery and a noble building, but its every stone has a story\r\nto tell or a mystery to explain. What depths of thought are hidden in\r\nthose tremendous marble pictures between the doors! First the whole\r\nstory of Genesis, then the Old Testament story which followed Genesis,\r\nleading on to the birth of Christ; then the story of our Saviour’s life\r\nupon earth; and lastly, the lesson of His redemption wrought for us, in\r\nthe resurrection of the dead to the second life. Even the minor figures\r\nwhich surround these greater subjects, how much they have to tell us!\r\nTake the wondrous angels which surround the story of Christ; the\r\nAwe-stricken Angel of the Salutation, the Welcoming Angel of the Flight\r\ninto Egypt, the Praying Angel of the Temptation, the Suffering Angel of\r\nthe Betrayal, the Agonised Angel (and, oh, what a sublime figure, with\r\nits face covered with its hands!) of the Crucifixion, the Angel, rapt in\r\nentire unutterable beatitude, of the Resurrection. Or let us look at the\r\ngroups of prophets, who, standing beneath the life of Christ, foresee\r\nand foretell its events,--their eager invocation, their meditation,\r\ntheir inspiration, their proclamation of that which was to be.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy companions returned to Rome from Orvieto and I went on to Florence,\r\nwhere I found two old friends of my childhood--Ann-Emilia and Kate\r\nMalcolm, the latter of whom has always been one of the most agreeable\r\nand charming women I have ever known.[58] I remember her telling me, on\r\nthis occasion, of a friend of hers who was one day sitting at the end of\r\nher terrace at a retired watering-place, and heard a bride and\r\nbridegroom talking together beneath. “My dear,” said the bridegroom, “I\r\nthink it would not be unpleasant if a friend were to turn up this\r\nevening.”--“My dear,” retorted the bride, “I should be thankful to see\r\neven _an enemy_.” She had also a story of an old Scotch minister, who,\r\nbeing summoned to marry some couples, thus addressed them:--“Ma freends,\r\nto many, marriage is a great curse: ma freends, to some marriage is a\r\ngreat blessing: ma freends, to all marriage is a great uncertainty: wull\r\nye risk it?” and they all said “Yes.” With the Malcolms I saw much of\r\nSir James Lacaita. He was very full of convents and their abuses. He\r\ntold me that he had personally known a nun who was forced into a convent\r\nto prevent her from marrying the man she loved; but he made a silken\r\nladder, and, by bribing the gardener, got it fixed to her window. The\r\nnun escaped, but was in such a hurry to descend, that she slid down the\r\ncords, cut open both her hands, and bore the marks all her life. Her\r\nlover was rich, had relays of horses, and they escaped to Sicily, were\r\nmarried at once, and had eleven children. Lacaita also told me:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORCH OF CREMONA.][59]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“A beautiful girl of good family was left £6000 by her father, on\r\ncondition that she did not enter a convent. To prevent her doing so, he\r\nordained that the money should revert to her brother in case of her\r\nbecoming a nun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIAZZA MAGGIORE, BERGAMO.][60]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“The girl hated the very idea of a convent, but the brother made a\r\ncompact with an abbess to give her a third of the girl’s fortune if they\r\ncould force her to take the veil. She resisted vigorously, though the\r\nbrother’s wife ill-treated her in every possible way, and she had no\r\nother home. She possessed a lover, who professed great devotion, but\r\nnever would come to the point. At last the time came when the brother\r\nhad arranged for her to go to the convent. Her treatment was such that\r\nshe had no other course. Her lover came and pitied her. She implored\r\nhim: she knelt at his feet: she stretched out her hands: she said, ‘You\r\nknow you can save me;’ but he feared the priests, the Church, and her\r\nbrother too much. As she knelt there, her sister-in-law opened the door.\r\nThen her horror at her position was so great, she at once declared that\r\nshe would take the veil: she only wished the event hurried on.\r\n\r\n“At last the day of the sacrifice arrived. Lacaita was present. The\r\nbride came in, in her wedding splendour, _fière_, darting defiance at\r\nthem all; but Lacaita said he never should forget the shriek she gave\r\nwhen all was over and the grille closed upon her.\r\n\r\n“The remorse of the lover began at once: he never spoke to a woman for\r\ntwenty years: then he---- married!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLacaita also told me a most interesting story concerning persons whom he\r\nhad known, of which I forget the details, but the substance was that--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA beautiful girl in Sicily, of very noble family, was engaged by her\r\nparents to make a magnificent marriage with an Italian prince of the\r\nhighest rank, who had never seen her, and had only heard the report of\r\nher beauty. As she loved another, she made great friends with the\r\ngardener’s daughter, and persuaded her--for she was very lovely also--to\r\npersonate her, which the peasant girl, pleased at the notion of being a\r\nprincess, was very willing to do. Meantime the young Countess, supposed\r\nto have gone to her nuptials, eloped with the lover she preferred. The\r\npeasant bride was married, but her prince soon began to think she was\r\nwonderfully little educated, for he had heard of her great learning as\r\nwell as her beauty, and especially of her wonderful artistic powers, and\r\ntwo years after he obtained a divorce on the plea that she was married\r\nunder a false name.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom Florence I went to Cremona and Bergamo, lingering at them and\r\nseeing them thoroughly in glorious weather, which made one observe that,\r\nthough the Southern Italian skies are the opal ones, the Northern are\r\nthe blue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI spent June (1873) in London. At luncheon at Lady Marion Alford’s I met\r\nMr. Carlyle, who was full of the “Memorials.” He said, “I do not often\r\ncry and am not much given to weeping, but your book is most profoundly\r\ntouching, and when the dear Augustus was making the hay I felt a lesson\r\ndeep down in my heart.” He talked of Lady Ashburton--“Ah! yes, Lady\r\nAshburton is just a bonnie Highland lassie, a free-spoken and\r\nopen-hearted creature as ever was; and Hattie Hosmer, she is a fanciful\r\nkind of a being, who does not know yet that art is dead.” Finally he\r\nwent off into one of his characteristic speeches. “That which the warld\r\ntorments me in most is the awful confusion of noise. It is the devil’s\r\nown infernal din all the blessed day long, confounding God’s warks and\r\nHis creatures--a truly awfu’ hell-like combination, and the warst of a’\r\nis a railway whistle, like the screech of ten thousand cats, and ivery\r\ncat of them all as big as a cathédral.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.--_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_London, June 14, 1873._--I have seen and heard much that is\r\ninteresting. Yesterday I met Lord Aberdeen at luncheon, and liked him\r\nvery much. Then I went to old Lady Wensleydale’s afternoon reception,\r\nintending to stay ten minutes, and did stay two hours and a half, it was\r\nso agreeable, and I saw so many old friends. Mrs. W. Lowther is always\r\npleasant, the rooms are delightful, and the charming garden full of\r\nflowers.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 19._--Dined with Lord Ravensworth--a very pleasant party, to meet\r\npoor Lord Durham, whom I had not seen since his great sorrow. He looks\r\nas if he had cried night and day ever since, and _did_ cry in a corner\r\nwhen a touching song was sung about a young wife. I was very glad to\r\nmeet him again. He is quite devoted to his thirteen children, and the\r\neldest girl, of thirteen, manages everything.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 3._--The most extraordinary thing the Shah has done has been\r\noffering to buy Lady Margaret Beaumont (to carry off to Persia) for\r\n£500,000!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 24, 1873._--I went to luncheon with Lady Barrington, and found\r\nher still in tears for the Bishop of Winchester’s[61] death. He had\r\ndined with her a few days before, and she had spoken of the pleasure it\r\nwould be to him to go to Farnham. ‘Oh, I shall _never_ go to Farnham,’\r\nhe said; ‘the old Bishop of Winchester will long survive me;’ and so it\r\nwas. ‘Oh, what a joyful surprise for him!’ said Carlyle when he heard of\r\nthe Bishop’s sudden death. ‘He is our _show_ man for the Church of\r\nEngland,’ Hugh Pearson used to say.\r\n\r\n“Dined at Lord Salisbury’s, and sat between Miss Alderson and Lady Cork.\r\nI had always heard of Lady Cork as one of the best talkers in London,\r\nbut was not prepared for such a display of summer lightning as it was.\r\nHere is a trifling specimen.\r\n\r\n“_Lord Salisbury._--‘I am so glad he speaks English. I find it such an\r\nextra fatigue to have to struggle with a foreign tongue, and to think of\r\nthe words as well as the ideas.’\r\n\r\n“_Lady Cork._--‘Well, I am afraid when I talk, I think neither of the\r\none nor the other.’\r\n\r\n“_Lord S._--‘Yes, but then you come of a race’ ...\r\n\r\n“_Lady C._--‘Wha-a-at, or I had better use that most expressive French\r\nexpression ‘Plait-il?’ ... We have only one English sentence which would\r\ndo as well--‘I beg your parding’--with a _g_.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 26._--I reached Chevening about 6 P.M. It is a dull square white\r\nhouse with wings, but was once red, and was designed by Inigo Jones,\r\nfrom whom it retains the old plan, not only of the building, but of the\r\nstraight avenue, the lake, and the fountain with water-lilies before the\r\ndoor. Between the house and the lake is the loveliest of flower-gardens,\r\na wilderness of old-fashioned flowers, most perfectly charming. Here\r\nLady Stanhope was sitting out with Lord and Lady Carnarvon and Lord and\r\nLady Mahon. Lord Carnarvon is agreeable and his wife most lovely and\r\npiquant. Lady Mahon, very prettily dressed _en bergère_, looked like a\r\nflower herself as she moved in her bright blue dress through the living\r\nlabyrinth of colour.\r\n\r\n“Lady Carnarvon gave an amusing account of her visit to Dulwich College,\r\nof which her husband is a governor, and how she had produced a great\r\neffect by remarking that they used a new pronunciation of Latin; ‘and my\r\nlittle girl behaved very well too, and, though she was most awfully\r\nbored, smiled and bowed at all the right moments.... We came away before\r\nthe speeches, which were all quite horrid, I believe, except\r\nCarnarvon’s, and that I am quite sure was very nice indeed.”\r\n\r\n“Lord Stanhope talked of chess--a Persian game: in Germany they retain\r\nthe old names: checkmate is _Shahmate_. He said when the Shah of Persia\r\nwas in London it was quite impossible to make him understand how the\r\ntelegraph worked, until some one had the presence of mind to say, ‘If\r\nyour Majesty will imagine an immense dog, so big that his tail is in\r\nLondon while his head is in Teheran, your Majesty will see that if some\r\none treads upon his tail in London, he will bark in Teheran.’\r\n\r\n“Lord Stanhope spoke of the total absence of commissariat management in\r\nEngland, so that, if there was an invasion, the salvation of the country\r\nwould positively have to be abandoned to Messrs. Spiers & Pond.\r\n\r\n“Lord Carnarvon asked why Oxford was like an old Roman arsenal ‘Because\r\nthe honours are _classes_, the men are _puppes_, and the women are\r\n_nautes_.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sunday, July 28._--We had a dull missionary sermon at church, in which\r\nthe clergyman spoke of the poor Bishop of Winchester’s death as if it\r\nwas a judgment for his crimes. After service Lady Airlie talked of the\r\n‘Memorials,’ which she discussed as we walked round the lake. She spoke\r\nmuch of prevailing religious opinions, and said that it would be as\r\ndifficult to believe in complete inspiration now as to believe in\r\nwitchcraft. I startled her by telling her I did believe in witchcraft,\r\nand told something of Madame de Trafford. In the afternoon we drove with\r\nLord Stanhope to Knockholt Beeches and back by the steep park drive. The\r\ncountry was quite lovely. Lord Stanhope entertained us constantly with\r\nthat essence of courtesy and good-breeding which almost makes you feel\r\nas if you were the entertainer and the obliging, instead of the\r\nentertained and the obliged--indeed such perfection of courteous\r\nkindness I have never seen elsewhere in any one. I walked with Lady\r\nAirlie up to the beeches, and she talked of Lady Waterford, whom, she\r\nsaid, she worshipped afar off, as I did nearer.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 29._--A long talk about art and drawing and Italy with old Mr.\r\nCheney, who said, speaking of the best buildings, ‘They are much too\r\ngood for this generation: it will destroy them because they are so\r\nbeautiful.’ He is so pleasant that I could understand a bit of a\r\ndialogue I overheard between him and Lady Airlie.\r\n\r\n“_Lady A._--‘I am so sorry Englishwomen are not like French: they have\r\nnot always _le désir de plaire_.’\r\n\r\n“_Mr. C._--Well I confess I always like Englishwomen best, and even\r\ntheir manners seem to me far more charming.’\r\n\r\n“_Lady A._--‘Oh, yes; I can quite understand that _all_ must have _le\r\ndésir de plaire_ when they are near _you_.’\r\n\r\n“I walked with Mahon in the gardens and up the hill, crushing the wild\r\nthyme and sweet marjory, and then drove with Lord Stanhope, a long\r\ncharming drive up the Brasted hill, by poor Vine’s Gate and Chartwell,\r\nboth of many associations. He stopped the carriage to have some\r\nfoxgloves gathered, and said how the name pleased him, for the plant was\r\nthe fairies’ own special flower, and the name came from folks’ love. He\r\nwould only have one great stem of each foxglove gathered, the rest must\r\nbe left for the fairies. Lord Stanhope told me that when he took\r\nMacaulay up that hill he looked long at the view and then said, ‘How\r\nevident it is that there has never been, can never have been, an\r\ninvasion here: no other country could supply this view.”\r\n\r\n“Lord Stanhope talked much of the poet Claudian, so superior to\r\nStatius--his descriptions so picturesque, especially that of an old man\r\nwho had never been outside the walls of his native city, and how they\r\ntook him out in his extreme old age, and of all that he said, &c.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Sept. 10, 1873._--I enjoy your detailed letters. In them a\r\nbreeze from the outer world sweeps in upon my solitude. Not that it is\r\nquite solitude either, for Charlotte Leycester is still here, and Fanny\r\nTatton is at Hastings, and often coming up to luncheon, and Miss Cole\r\nhas been here for ten days, and her sister Louisa for three. Both these\r\nold friends are most pleasant and charming, and I was very glad to\r\nreceive here again those whom the dear Mother was so fond of seeing in\r\nher little home. And we talked much of her, they so truly feeling all\r\nthat she was, that it is as if a fragrance out of her beautiful past was\r\nhallowing their lives.\r\n\r\n“The little Hospice has been full all summer. The present inmates are\r\nmost romantic in title as well as dress--‘Sister Georgina Mary, Sister\r\nMildred, and Sister Lilian.’ They come from St. Alban’s, Holborn, so\r\nyou may imagine that Charlotte Leycester has already had some passages\r\nat arms with them. But they are truly excellent as well as pleasant\r\nguests, and I console Charlotte by telling her that if she likes to\r\nsupply me with any suffering Methodists when they are gone, I shall be\r\nequally glad to see them. Certainly, the only real pleasure in having\r\nany money is the opportunities it gives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOSPICE, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n“Admirable, holy, saint-like, as I think dear Charlotte Leycester, her\r\nSabbatarianism is a sore small trial to me when she lives with me for\r\nmonths. I love her most dearly, but I often long to say to her something\r\nlike the words of Bussy-Rabutin, ‘Souvent on arrive à la même fin par\r\ndifférentes voies: pour moi, je ne condamne pas vos manières, chacun se\r\nsauve à sa guise; mais je n’irai point à la béatitude par le chemin que\r\nvous suivez.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Sept. 19, 1873._--Yesterday I took Hugh Pearson[62] to\r\nHurstmonceaux. The walk through the wild ferny park and its decaying\r\nbeeches was most delightful, with the softest lights and shadows\r\nglinting over the delicate distances of the Levels. What a place of\r\nmemories it is! every tree, every pathlet with the reminiscences of so\r\nmany generations.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Sept. 30._--I came to Binstead Wyck[63] from Thornhill. It is a\r\ncharming family home on the edge of a deep declivity, with wide views\r\ninto the purple hollows between the beech-trees. From the windows we\r\ncould see Blackmoor, whither we went the next day--the great modern\r\nmediæval house of the Lord Chancellor Selborne, set down, as it were,\r\nanywhere in an utterly inexpressive part of his large low-lying\r\nproperty, but with pleasant Scotchified views of heath and fir\r\nplantations. The Chancellor, pleasant and beaming, was kind, Lady\r\nSelborne very nice, and the four daughters charming. The next day we\r\nwent to ‘White’s Selborne,’ through bowery lanes, where the hedges are\r\nall bound together by clematis. It is a beautiful village, just under a\r\nwooded hill called ‘the Hanger.’ The old house of Gilbert White is now\r\ninhabited by a striking old man, Mr. Bell, a retired dentist, the\r\nbeneficence, the ‘Bon Dieu,’ of the neighbourhood. He showed us his\r\nlovely sunny lawn, with curious trees and shrubs, sloping up to the rich\r\nwooded hillside, and, in the house, the stick, barometer, and spectacles\r\nof Gilbert White.\r\n\r\n“The adjoining property belonged to Sir Charles Taylor. His father was a\r\nfine old man, and some of his jokes are still quoted.\r\n\r\n“‘How are you, sir? I hope you are quite well,’ said a young man who\r\ncame on a visit.\r\n\r\n“‘_Well_, sir! I am suffering from a mortal disease.’\r\n\r\n“‘A mortal disease! and pray what may that be?’ said the young man,\r\naghast.\r\n\r\n“‘Why, I am suffering, sir, from--Anno Domini.’\r\n\r\n“Close to Selborne we saw the source of the Wey--a pretty spring\r\ntumbling over a rock near the road.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 4-10._--A charming visit at Shavington, the great desolate brick\r\nhouse of Lord Kilmorey.[64] It has very little furniture, but some fine\r\npictures, the best of them, by Gainsborough, representing an Hon.\r\nFrancis Needham of the Grenadier Guards, who was poisoned at a\r\nmagistrates’ dinner at Salthill in 1773. Lady Fanny Higginson[65] talked\r\nmuch of their old neighbours the Corbets of Adderley: how, when Lady\r\nCorbet was a child, she squinted very much, and how Dr. Johnson, when\r\nshe was introduced to him, said, ‘Come here, you little\r\nSquintifinko’--which gave her the greatest horror of him. When the\r\nfamily doctor called at Adderley, it was generally just before dinner,\r\nand Lady Corbet used to ask him to stay for it, and he found this so\r\npleasant that he came very often in this way, merely for the sake of the\r\ndinner; but when his bill came in, she found all these visits charged\r\nlike the others. She returned it to him with his visits divided into two\r\ncolumns, one headed ‘Official’ and the other ‘Officious,’ and she always\r\nafterwards spoke of him as ‘the officious official.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Ford Castle, Oct. 18, 1873._--The long journey and the bitterly cold\r\ndrive across the moors from Belford almost made me think before arriving\r\nthat absence must have exaggerated the charms of this place; but the\r\nkind welcome of the hostess in the warm library, brilliant with flowers\r\nand colour, soon dispelled all that. There is only a small party here,\r\nwhat Lady Waterford calls a _pension des demoiselles_--the two Miss\r\nLindsays (Lady Sarah’s daughters), Mrs. and Miss Fairholme, Lady Taunton\r\nand her daughter, and Lady Gertrude Talbot. All are fond of art and not\r\nunworthy of the place.\r\n\r\n“I _should_ like you to see it. No description gives any idea, not so\r\nmuch of the beautiful old towers, the brilliant flower-beds in the\r\nembrasures of the wall, the deep glen of old beeches, the village\r\nclustering round its tall fountain, and the soft colouring of the\r\nCheviots and Flodden,--as of the wonderful atmosphere of goodness and\r\nlove which binds all the people, the servants, the guests, so\r\nunconsciously around the beautiful central figure in this great _home_.\r\nEach cottage garden is a replica--the tiniest replica--of Lady\r\nWaterford’s own, equally cared for by her; each village child nestles up\r\nto her as she appears, the very tiny ones for the sugar-plums which she\r\nputs into their pockets, the elders to tell her everything as to a\r\nmother. And within the house, everything is at once so simple and so\r\nbeautiful, every passage full of pictures, huge ferns, brilliant\r\ngeraniums, tall vases, &c. In the evening Lady Waterford sings as\r\ndelightfully as ever, and in all the intervals talks as no one else\r\ncan--such exquisite stories of olden times, such poetical descriptions\r\nof scenery, and all so truth-inspiring because so wonderfully\r\nsimple.”[66]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 19._--You will never guess what I was doing yesterday--preaching\r\nto the children!\r\n\r\n“In the morning, to my great surprise, Mr. Neville, the clergyman, came\r\nwhile Lady Waterford was at the school, to say he had no help that day:\r\nwould I help him? There was a service for children in the church: would\r\nI undertake the sermon part? I thought it quite impossible, and utterly\r\nrefused at first, only promising to read the Morning Lessons. However,\r\nin the afternoon, when I found it was not only wished but _wanted_, I\r\nconsented. I took one of Neale’s Sermons as a foundation, and then\r\ndiscoursed--half story, half sermon; the story being of the departure of\r\nthe swallows from Etal and Ford and Flodden at this time of year; the\r\ntraining from their parents--so much depending upon whether they\r\nattended or not, whether they practised their wings in preparation for\r\nthe long journey or were idle; then of the temptations they had to\r\nidleness, &c.; of the journey, the crossing the sea (of death in the\r\nmoral), of the difficulty of crossing alone, of the clinging of some to\r\nthe mast of a ship (the Saviour), which bore them through the\r\ndifficulties. I was dreadfully alarmed at the idea, but, having once\r\nbegun, had no difficulty whatever, and it all came quite fluently\r\nwithout any seeking, though beforehand I could think of nothing to say;\r\nso that Lady Waterford said the only fault the children would find was\r\nthat it was so much longer than their usual sermons. There was a great\r\ncongregation of children, and all the guests in the house, and many of\r\nthe servants.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 16._--Mrs. Fairholme talked of her visit to Jedburgh--that she\r\nhad said to the old man who showed it, ‘Do you know, I admire your abbey\r\na great deal more than Melrose.’--‘Yes,’ he said, ‘there is no doubt it\r\nis a great deal the finer; but then you know, Ma’am, Sir Walter has cast\r\nsuch a halloo over Melrose that it has thrown everything else into the\r\nshade.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 17._--Mrs. Fairholme brought down a beautiful miniature of an\r\nunknown lady to breakfast, which was the subject of much discussion.\r\nLady Waterford said how she had designed a series of drawings for the\r\nwhole ‘Story of a Picture.’\r\n\r\n“1.

They used to say, if they saw me as strong as a horse, “Ah!\r\nthere, look at my lady; it is true she is as strong as a horse, but then\r\nshe always has all the wine she wants,” but now they say, “My lady has\r\nno wine at all, and yet you see she is as strong as a horse.”’\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Fairholme spoke of Curramore, and how she disliked somebody who\r\npretended that the beautiful terraces there were designed by herself and\r\nnot by Lady Waterford. With her generous simplicity, Lady Waterford\r\nsaid, ‘Oh, I don’t see why you should do that at all: I think it was\r\nrather a compliment, for it showed she admired the terraces, or she\r\nwould not have wished it to be supposed that they were due to her.’\r\n\r\n“Miss Fairholme was tired. ‘Now do rest,’ Lady Waterford said--‘there is\r\nthe sofa close by you--qui vous tend les bras;’ and then she talked to\r\nus of old Lady Balcarres, ‘the mother of Grandmama Hardwicke’--the\r\nsevere mother, who, when one of her little boys disobeyed her, ordered\r\nthe servants to fling him into the pond in front of the house. He\r\nmanaged to scramble out again; she bade them throw him in a second time,\r\nand a second time he got out, and, when she ordered it a third time, he\r\nexclaimed in his broad Scotch accent, ‘Woman, wad ye droun yer ain son?’\r\n\r\n“In the afternoon we were to have gone to the Heathpool Lynn, but did go\r\nto Langley Ford by mistake--a very long walk, after leaving the\r\ncarriage, up a bleak moorland valley. I walked chiefly with Miss\r\nLindsay. She talked of the extraordinary discovery of the well at Castle\r\nHedingham by ‘a wise woman’ by the power of the hazel wand--the hazel\r\ntwig bending on the right spot, not only upon the ground itself, but\r\nupon the representation of it on the map. She talked of the blind and\r\ndumb Sabbatarianism of the Presbyterians. She asked a respectable poor\r\nwoman how she liked the new preacher. ‘Wad I presume?’ she replied.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 18._--This morning Lady Waterford wished that the Misses Lindsay\r\nhad been dressed alike even in details. ‘It is a law of nature, I think,\r\nthat sisters should dress alike. A covey of partridges are all alike;\r\nthey do not want to have feathers of different colours; and why not\r\nchildren of the same family?’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANGLEY FORD, IN THE CHEVIOTS.][67]\r\n\r\n“We had a charming walk to Etal in the afternoon--lovely soft lights on\r\nthe distant hills, and brilliant reflections of the autumnal foliage in\r\nthe Till. We went to the castle, and then down the glen by St. Mary’s\r\nOratory and Well. Lady W. talked of the beauty of the sedges and of\r\ntheir great variety--of the difficult law, or rather no law, of\r\nreflections. Then of marriages--of the number of widows being so much\r\ngreater than that of widowers, and of the change which the loss of a\r\nhusband made in all the smallest details of life: of the supreme\r\ndesolation of Lady Charlotte Denison, ‘after a honeymoon of forty-three\r\nyears.’ Old Lady Tankerville was of another nature. She was urging a\r\nwidowed friend to do something. ‘Oh, but my cap, my cap!’ groaned the\r\nfriend. ‘Comment,’ exclaimed Lady Tankerville, ‘c’est le vrai bonnet de\r\nla liberté.’\r\n\r\n“Speaking of complexions--‘My grandmother used to say,’ said Mrs.\r\nFairholme, ‘that beauty “went out” with open carriages. “Why, you are\r\njust like men, my dear,” she said, “with your brown necks, and your\r\nrough skins, and your red noses. In our days it was different; young\r\nladies never walked, ate nothing but white meat, and never washed their\r\nfaces. They covered their faces with powder, and then put cold cream on,\r\nand wiped it off with a flannel: that was the way to have a good\r\ncomplexion.’”\r\n\r\n“‘I think it was Henri III.,’ said Lady Waterford, ‘who used to go to\r\nsleep with raw veal chops on his cheeks, and to cover his hands with\r\npomade, and have them tied up to the top of the bed by silk cords, that\r\nthey might be white in the morning.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 21._--Lady Waterford talked of her maid Rebekah, who lived with\r\nher so long. ‘The mistake was that we were together as girls and used to\r\nromp together; and so, when I married, she thought she was to rule me.\r\nBut she became the most dreadful tyrant: Tina used to say I wore her as\r\na hair-shirt.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 23._--Lady Waterford talked of ‘Grandmama Hardwicke’--how\r\nterrified she was of robbers: that one day, when she was going to cross\r\na wide heathy common, she said, ‘If any one comes up to the carriage, I\r\nshall give up all I have at once: I shall give him no chance of being\r\nviolent.’ Soon after, a man rode up. ‘Oh, take my money, but spare my\r\nlife,’ exclaimed Lady Hardwicke, and threw her purse at him. ‘My good\r\nwoman, I don’t want your purse,’ said the man, who was a harmless\r\ntraveller.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 24._--Lord Houghton arrived. He is rather crusty, but most\r\namusing. His conversation is always interesting, even when no one else\r\ncan speak, and he seems to be saying, with Sydney Smith, to the art\r\ncircle here--‘My dears, it’s all right; you keep with the dilettanti: I\r\ngo with the talkettanti.’ He talked of Alnwick. ‘It was there I first\r\nmet Père Hyacinthe. He did not strike me as anything remarkable. One\r\nevening he gave us a “Meditation.” It was just a falling into a topic\r\nand going on upon it; but nothing original or particular. I heard his\r\nsermons at Rome. He used to say a thing and then back out of it; but\r\nunder the pulpit sat three Inquisitors, and they were finding him out\r\nall the time. One thing he said--speaking of religious differences--was,\r\n“N’oublions jamais que le premier crime du monde était une querelle\r\nentre deux sacerdos.”’\r\n\r\n“Lord Houghton talked of the Bonapartes, and of the graves of Josephine\r\nand Hortense at Rueil, and of Madame Mère. ‘I had a very narrow miss of\r\nseeing Madame Mère, and I am very sorry I did not do it, for it would\r\nonly have cost a scudo. She was a very long time dying, it was a kind of\r\nlying in state, and for a scudo the porter used to let people in behind\r\na screen which there was at the foot of the bed, and they looked at her\r\nthrough the joinings. I was only a boy then, and I thought there was\r\nplenty of time, and put it off; but one day she died.’\r\n\r\n“Lord Houghton also said--\r\n\r\n“‘One of the prettiest ghost stories I ever heard is that of General\r\nRadowitz. He was made Governor of Frankfort, and not being able to go\r\nhimself, and having servants who had lived with him a long time and knew\r\nall his tastes, he sent them on before him to secure a suitable house\r\nand get everything ready. They chose an excellent house, with a large\r\ngarden full of lilacs and laburnums, overlooking the glacis. When\r\nGeneral and Madame Radowitz arrived some time after, they found\r\neverything as they wished, and began to question their old servants as\r\nto how they had got on, and especially as to the neighbours. The\r\nservants said that the next villa was inhabited by a person who was\r\nquite remarkable--a lady who was always known in Frankfort as the\r\n“weisse Frau,”--a very sweet, gentle person, who was full of charity and\r\nkindness, and greatly beloved. She had, however, quite lost her memory\r\nas to the past since the death, very long ago, of her lover in battle:\r\nshe had even forgotten his name, and answered to all questions about him\r\nor her own past, “Ich weiss nicht! ich weiss nicht!” but always with a\r\nsweet sad smile. And she had lived in the place so long, that, every one\r\nbelonging to her having passed away, no one really knew her history.\r\nYet, while her mind was gone as to the past, as to the practical present\r\nshe was quite herself, went to market and transacted her own affairs.\r\n\r\n“‘Gradually the confidential maid of Madame Radowitz made friends with\r\nthe servants of the “weisse Frau”--for the gardens of the two houses\r\njoined--and from servants’ gossip the Radowitz family learnt a good deal\r\nabout her, and from all around they heard of her as greatly respected,\r\nbut always the same, sad and sweet, always dressed in white, never\r\nremembering anything.\r\n\r\n“‘One day the “weisse Frau,” who had taken a great fancy to the maid of\r\nMadame Radowitz, invited her to come to her at twelve o’clock the next\r\nday: she said she expected some one; indeed, she pressed the maid to\r\ncome without fail. The maid told her mistress, who said certainly she\r\nhad better go; she should on no account wish so excellent a person as\r\nthe “weisse Frau” to be disappointed.\r\n\r\n“‘When the maid went, she found the little salon of the “weisse Frau” in\r\ngala decoration, the table laid and bright with flowers, and places set\r\nfor three. The Frau was not in her usual white dress, but in a curious\r\nold costume of rich brocade, which was said to have been intended for\r\nher wedding-dress. She still said she expected some one, but when asked\r\nwho it was, looked distressed and bewildered, and only said “Ich weiss\r\nnicht!”\r\n\r\n“‘As it drew near twelve o’clock she became greatly agitated--she said\r\n_he_ was coming. At length she threw the windows wide open, and gazing\r\nout into the street, looked back and said, “Er kommt! er kommt!” She had\r\na radiant expression no one remembered to have seen before; her eyes\r\nsparkled, every feature became animated--and as the clock struck twelve,\r\nshe went out upon the landing, appeared to enfold some one invisible in\r\nher arms, and then walking very slowly back into the room, exclaimed\r\n“Hoffmann,” and sank down dead!\r\n\r\n“‘In the supreme moment of life she had remembered the long-forgotten\r\nname.’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“On Wednesday Lady Waterford took her books and drawing, and went to the\r\nforge to spend the afternoon with ‘Frizzle’--a poor bedridden woman\r\nthere, to whom _thus_, not by a rapid visit, she brings enough sunshine\r\nand pleasure once every week to last for the other six days. Often she\r\nsings by the bedside, not only hymns, but a whole variety of things. I\r\ndrove Mrs. Fairholme to the Routing Lynn, and we came in for one of the\r\nfiercest storms I ever knew; not rain or snow, but lumps of ice, an inch\r\nand a half long, blowing straight upon us from the Cheviots. Lady\r\nWaterford came in delighted. ‘I do enjoy a difficult walk. When it is\r\nwinter, and the ground is deep in snow and the wind blowing hard, I\r\nsteal out and take a walk and enjoy it. I try to steal out unobserved; I\r\ndo not like the servants to get into a state about me, but I am\r\ngenerally betrayed afterwards by a wet petticoat or something.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 25._--Last night Lord Houghton talked much about Mrs. Harcourt’s\r\ndiaries, which he had edited (she was lady in waiting to Queen\r\nCharlotte), but the royal family had cut out so much as to make them\r\nnot worth publishing. When the poor Princesses heard of another German\r\nprince marrying, they used to say in a despairing tone, ‘Another chance\r\nlost.’\r\n\r\n“At Weymouth, Mrs. Harcourt described going to see the royal family in\r\nthe evening. ‘I ventured,’ she said, ‘to express my regret that the\r\nQueen should have had so unfavourable a morning for her water\r\nexpedition,’ whereat Prince William somewhat coarsely replied, ‘I only\r\nwish the accursed bitch would have spewed her soul up, and then we\r\nshould have had some peace in the house.’\r\n\r\n“The Duke of York was the only one of his sons the King really cared\r\nfor, and he said that the Duke’s faults were the cause of his madness.\r\n\r\n“This morning, before leaving, Lord Houghton talked of Howick, that he\r\nthought it a very dull place, while Lady Waterford and I maintained that\r\nit was a most pleasant, attractive family home. He said the Greys were\r\nvery self-important but not conceited: that he agreed with Charles\r\nBuller, who said, ‘No, the Greys are certainly not conceited: they only\r\ndemand of you that you should concede the absolute truth of one single\r\nproposition, which is, that it has pleased Providence in its inscrutable\r\nwisdom to endow one family with every conceivable virtue and talent,\r\nand, this once conceded, the Greys are really rather humble than\r\notherwise, because they feel they do not come up to their\r\nopportunities.’\r\n\r\n“He said, ‘It is very interesting to remember that all the beasts are\r\nSaxon, but when they become meat they become Norman.’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n“_Raby Castle, Oct. 31, 1873._--My visit here has been very pleasant,\r\nthe Duchess cordial, and a delightful party.

Once they travelled abroad together, and\r\nat an inn in Germany slept in the same room, in which there was also a\r\nthird bed with the curtains drawn round it. Two days after, one brother\r\nsaid to the other, “Did you see what was in that bed in our room the\r\nother night?” and the other answered, “Yes.” This was all that passed,\r\nbut they had both seen a dead body in the bed.’\r\n\r\n“The Duchess expects every one to devote themselves to _petits jeux_ in\r\nthe evening, and many of the guests do not like it. There is also a book\r\nin which every one is expected to write something when they go away.\r\nThere is one column for complaints: you are intended to complain that\r\nyour happy visit has come to an end, or something of that kind. There is\r\nanother column of ‘Why you came’--to which the natural answer seems to\r\nbe ‘Because I was asked.’ Some one wrote--\r\n\r\n    ‘To see their Graces\r\n     And to kill their grouses.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RABY CASTLE.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“I have, however, really enjoyed my visit very much indeed, and on\r\ntaking leave just now I wrote--\r\n\r\n    ‘In the desert of life, so dismal and wide,\r\n     A charming oasis is sometimes descried,\r\n     Where none are afraid their true feelings to own,\r\n     And wit never takes a satirical tone;\r\n     Where new roots of affection are planted each hour,\r\n     By courtesy, kindness, and magical power;\r\n     Where fresh friendships are formed, and destined to last,\r\n     In a golden chain fettered and rivetted fast.\r\n     Such a garden is Raby:--those who gather its flowers,\r\n     In grateful remembrance will think of the hours\r\n     Which, enjoyed, do not vanish, but seem to display\r\n     In riplets of silver the wake of their way.’\r\n\r\n“One evening I told a story, unfortunately; for if I ever afterwards\r\nescaped to my room after five o’clock, there came a tap and a\r\nservant--‘Their Graces want you to come down again’--always from their\r\ninsatiable love of stories.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Nov._ 7, 1873, _Bretton_.--After three days with the dear cousins at\r\nRavensworth, I am glad to find myself again in this pleasant house,\r\nwhere I have been rapturously welcomed by the children, especially by\r\nlittle Hubert. I have found the Motleys here. He is very agreeable; and\r\nthe daughters, especially Mrs. Ives,[68] to whom her husband left £6000\r\na year after one month of married life, are very pleasant. Motley was\r\nshut up for a long time in his room the other day, and when he came in\r\nannounced that he had just finished the preface (which was the winding\r\nup) of his new book. All the other ladies began fulsome compliments, but\r\nMiss Susie Motley, jumping up and throwing her arms round his neck,\r\nexclaimed, ‘Oh, you dear foolish old thing, how could you go and spend\r\nso much time over what you may be quite sure nobody will ever read?’\r\nLady Margaret has just said--\r\n\r\n“‘Now, Mr. Hare, what do you do with your eyes(_i_’s)?’\r\n\r\n“‘Dot them.’\r\n\r\n“‘Then why don’t I dot mine? Now there is an opportunity for you to make\r\na pretty speech.’\r\n\r\n“‘I don’t know how.’\r\n\r\n“‘Why, how stupid you are! Because they are capital eyes (_i_’s). And\r\nnow, having provided thus much food for your mind, I will go and look\r\nafter your body by ordering the dinner.’\r\n\r\n“I was very sorry to leave the happy cordial party at Ravensworth of\r\neleven young cousins, most easy to get on with certainly, though I had\r\nnever seen some of them before. But, directly I arrived, one of them\r\ncame forward and said, ‘Please remember, Augustus, that my name is only\r\nNellie, and my sisters are Har and Pem and Vicky, and my cousins are,’\r\n&c. At Lamesley Church we had the oddest sermon, with such sentences\r\nas--‘Our first father would insist upon eating sour fruit, and has set\r\nall his descendants’ teeth on edge ever since.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n“_Highclere Castle, Nov. 12, 1873._--This is a beautiful park, with\r\nevery variety of scenery, hill, valley, woods, with an undergrowth of\r\nrhododendron, a poetical lake! and is so immense--thirteen miles\r\nround--that one never goes out of it, and rather feels the isolation of\r\nthe great house in the centre, which, though very handsome, is not equal\r\nto the place. Lady Carnarvon is very lovely and winning, and boundlessly\r\ninteresting to listen to: one understands Mr. Delane saying that he\r\nbelieved that there could be no successor to Lady Palmerston till he saw\r\nLady Carnarvon. She says that she has hitherto been too exclusive; that\r\nhenceforth she shall wish to fill her house more with people of every\r\nshade--‘for Carnarvon’s sake.’ As I watch her, I am perpetually reminded\r\nof Longfellow’s lines--\r\n\r\n    “‘Homeward serenely she walked, with God’s benediction upon her;\r\n     When she had passed, it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music.’\r\n\r\n“The guests are Sir Stafford, Lady, and Miss Northcote, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nChandos Leigh, Mr. Herman Merivale, the Charles Russells, and Mr.\r\nForester and his son and daughter-in-law, all pleasant people, yet on\r\nthe whole not so well-fitting a party as I have usually fallen in with.\r\nThe little daughter of the house--Winifred--is the most delightful and\r\nunspoilt of children.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Highclere, Nov. 13._--Mr. Herman Merivale told us--\r\n\r\n“A captain was crossing to America in his ship, with very few sailors\r\non board. One day one of them came up to him on the deck and said that\r\nthere was a strange man in his cabin--that he could not see the man’s\r\nface, but that he was sitting with his back to the door at the table\r\nwriting. The captain said it was impossible there could be any one in\r\nhis cabin, and desired the sailor to go and look again. When he came up,\r\nhe said the man was gone, but on the table was the paper on which he had\r\nwritten, with the ink still wet, the words--‘Steer due south.’ The\r\ncaptain said that, as he was not pressed for time, he would act on the\r\nmysterious warning. He steered due south, and met with a ship which had\r\nbeen long disabled and whose crew were in the last extremity.\r\n\r\n“The captain of the disabled ship said that one of his men was a very\r\nstrange character. He had himself picked him up from a deserted ship,\r\nand since then he had fallen into a cataleptic trance, in which, when he\r\nrecovered, he declared that he had been in another ship, begging its\r\ncaptain to come to their assistance. When the man who had been sent to\r\nthe cabin saw the cataleptic sailor, he recognised him at once as the\r\nman he had seen writing.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Merivale said that a case of the same kind had happened to himself.\r\n\r\n“He was staying at Harrow, and very late at night was summoned to\r\nLondon. Exactly as the clock struck twelve he passed the headmaster’s\r\ndoor in a fly. Both he and the friend who was with him were at that\r\nmoment attracted by seeing a hackney-coach at the door--a most unusual\r\nsight at that time of night, and a male figure, wrapped in black,\r\ndescend from it and glide into the house, without, apparently, ringing,\r\nor any door being opened. He spoke of it to his friend, and they both\r\nagreed that it was equally mysterious and inexplicable. The next day,\r\nthe circumstance so dwelt on Mr. Merivale’s mind, that he returned to\r\nHarrow, and going to the house, asked if the headmaster, Dr. Butler, was\r\nat home. ‘No,’ said the servant. Then he asked who had come at twelve\r\no’clock the night before. No one had come, no one had been heard of, no\r\ncarriage had been seen; but Dr. Butler’s father had died just at that\r\nmoment in a distant county.\r\n\r\n“Sir Charles Russell told us--\r\n\r\n“When the 34th Regiment was quartered at Gibraltar, it had the stupidest\r\nand dullest set of officers that can possibly be imagined; they not only\r\nknew nothing, but they preferred to know nothing; and especially were\r\nthey averse to learning anything of Spanish, which was certainly very\r\nshort-sighted of them, as it cut them off from so many social pleasures.\r\nBut nevertheless they all very much admired a beautiful young Spanish\r\nseñorita who was living at Gibraltar, and pretended that they were not\r\notherwise than in her good graces, which of course was simply bombast,\r\nas none of them knew a word of Spanish and scarcely a word of French, so\r\nthat not one of them had ever spoken to her.\r\n\r\n“One day, while the regiment was at Gibraltar, a young ensign came to\r\njoin, who had never been abroad before, and who knew even less of any\r\nforeign language than his comrades. Nevertheless, in a short time he\r\nhad taken cue by them, and pretended more than all the others to be in\r\nthe good graces of the young lady, and was well laughed at accordingly.\r\n\r\n“One evening at mess one of the officers mentioned that the señorita was\r\ngoing to Cadiz. ‘No, she is not,’ said the young ensign. ‘Oh, you young\r\njackanapes,’ said his fellow-officers, ‘what can you know about it? You\r\nknow nothing about her.’--‘Yes,’ he said sharply, ‘I do. She is not\r\ngoing to Cadiz; and what is more, I beg that her name may not be brought\r\nforward in this way at mess any more: I am engaged to be married to\r\nher.’\r\n\r\n“There was a universal roar, and an outcry of ‘You don’t suppose we are\r\ngoing to believe that?’ But the ensign said, ‘I give you my word of\r\nhonour as an officer and a gentleman that I _am_ engaged to be married\r\nto her.’\r\n\r\n“Then the Colonel, who was present, said, ‘Well, as he represents it in\r\nthis way, we are bound to believe him.’ And then, turning to the young\r\nensign, said, ‘Now my dear fellow, as we do accept what you say, I think\r\nyou need not leave us up in the clouds like this. Will you not tell us\r\nhow it came about? You cannot wonder that we should be a little\r\nsurprised, when we know that you do not speak a word of Spanish and only\r\ntwo or three words of French, that you should be engaged to be married\r\nto this young lady.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ said the ensign, ‘since you accept what I say, yes, I do not\r\nwonder that you are a little surprised. I do not mind telling you all\r\nabout it. It is quite true I do not understand a word of Spanish,\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nand only three or four words of French, but that does not matter. After\r\nthe ball at the Convent the other day (the house of the Governor of\r\nGibraltar is called ‘the Convent’) we went out upon the balcony, and we\r\nwatched the moonlight shimmering on the waves of the sea, and I looked\r\nup into her eyes, and I said, “Voulez vous?” and she said, “Quoi?”--and\r\nI said, “Moi;” and she said, “Oui”--and it was quite enough.’\r\n\r\n“In the churchyard here is an epitaph ‘To the memory of J. T. C., a man\r\nof great uprightness and integrity, and, as far as is consistent with\r\nhuman imperfection, an honest man.”[69]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sonning, Nov. 17, 1873._--It is quite curious how intimately this\r\nparish and its Rector (Hugh Pearson) are bound together. The Rectory is\r\nless his house than that of all his parishioners, and it is perfectly\r\nopen to them at all times. The choir is most amusing, the ‘poor dear\r\nchicks,’ as the Rector calls them, combing each other’s hair in the\r\nvestry before coming into church. A number of young men are constant\r\nintimates of the house, especially ‘Ken,’ Kenneth Mackenzie; ‘Spes,’\r\nHope; and ‘Francis,’ Lord Francis Harvey. There was once a bishopric\r\nhere, a fact which was disputed by Professor Stubbs at Oxford, who said\r\nit was at Ramsbury, upon which the Vicar immediately left his card on\r\nhim as ‘Bishop of Sonning.’\r\n\r\n“Speaking of Arthur Stanley’s absence of mind, H. P. has been\r\ndescribing how one day driving from Monreale to Palermo with their\r\ncarpet-bags on the seat before them, Arthur suddenly complained of the\r\ncold. ‘Well, you had better put something on,’ said H. P. ‘I will,’ said\r\nArthur. H. P. went on with his book, till, after some time, suddenly\r\nlooking up, he saw Arthur, who was also busily engaged in reading,\r\nentirely clothed in white raiment. He had put on his night-shirt over\r\nall his other clothes, without thinking what he was doing, and they were\r\njust driving into the streets of Palermo!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Ascot Wood, Jan. 5, 1874._--I came to London three weeks ago in a\r\nthick fog, such as Charles Lamb would have said was meat, drink, and\r\nclothing. One day I went with Lady Ashburton to visit Mr. Carlyle. It\r\nwas most interesting--the quaint simple old-fashioned brick house in\r\nCheyne Row; the faded furniture; the table where he toiled so long and\r\nfruitlessly at the deification of Frederick the Great; the workbox and\r\nother little occupatory articles of the long dead wife, always left\r\nuntouched; the living niece, jealous of all visitors, thinking that even\r\nLady Ashburton must have either testamentary or matrimonial intentions;\r\nand the great man himself in a long grey garment, half coat, half\r\ndressing-gown, which buttoned to the throat and fell in straight folds\r\nto the feet or below them, like one of the figures in Noah’s Ark, and\r\nwith the addition, when he went out with us, of an extraordinary tall\r\nbroad-brimmed felt hat, which can only be procured at a single village\r\nin Bavaria, and which gave him the air of an old magician.\r\n\r\n“He talked of Holman Hunt’s picture of the Home at Nazareth, ‘the most\r\nunnatural thing that ever was painted, and the most unnatural thing in\r\nit the idea that the Virgin should be keeping her “preciosities” in the\r\ncarpenter’s shop.\r\n\r\n“He talked of Landor, of the grandeur and unworldliness of his nature,\r\nand of how it was a lasting disgrace to England that the vile calumnies\r\nof an insolent slanderer had been suffered to blight him in the eyes of\r\nso many, and to send him out an exile from England in his old age.\r\n\r\n“He complained much of his health, fretting and fidgeting about himself,\r\nand said he could form no worse wish for the devil than that he might be\r\nable to give him his stomach to digest with through all eternity.\r\n\r\n“We walked out with him in the street, one on each side. I saw the\r\ncab-drivers pointing and laughing at the extraordinary figure, and\r\nindeed it was no wonder.\r\n\r\n“At Mrs. Thornton’s I met Miss Thackeray at dinner, and have seen her\r\nsince. She is charming, well worthy to be the authoress of her books.\r\nShe said till the money for ‘Old Kensington’ was spent, she should rest.\r\nShe spoke of the happiness of bringing up her little niece, of the\r\nsurroundings of young life which it gave her. She talked much of the\r\n‘Memorials,’ and of the problem how far it was well to be contented with\r\na quiet life as God sent it, and how far one ought to _seek_ for work\r\nfor Him. When I said something of her books and their giving pleasure;\r\nshe said, ‘Now let us skip that last sentence and go back to what we\r\nwere saying before.’\r\n\r\n“Colonel and Mrs. Henderson (of the Police Force) were at dinner. He\r\nsaid his father had been executor to old Lord Bridport, who had a box\r\nwhich no one was ever allowed to open, and of the contents of which even\r\nLady Bridport was ignorant. After Lord Bridport’s death, the widow sent\r\nfor Colonel Henderson to look into things, and then said, ‘I wish you\r\nwould open that box; one ought to know about it.’ Colonel Henderson did\r\nnot like doing it, but took the box into the library and sat down before\r\nit, with candles by his side. Immediately he heard a movement on the\r\nother side of the table, and, looking up, saw old Lord Bridport as\r\nclearly as he had ever seen him in his life, scowling down upon him with\r\na furious expression. He went back at once to Lady Bridport and\r\npositively refused to open the box, which was then destroyed unopened.\r\nHe said, ‘I shall never to my dying day forget the face of Lord Bridport\r\nas I saw him after he was dead.’\r\n\r\n“In Wilton Crescent I saw Mrs. Leycester, who was just come from\r\nCheshire. She said:--\r\n\r\n“A brother of Sir Philip Egerton has lately been given a living in\r\nDevonshire, and went to take possession of it. He had not been long in\r\nhis rectory before, coming one day into his study, he found an old lady\r\nseated there in an arm-chair by the fire. Knowing no old lady could\r\nreally be there, and thinking the appearance must be the result of an\r\nindigestion, he summoned all his courage and boldly sat down upon the\r\nold lady, who disappeared. The next day he met the old lady in the\r\npassage, rushed up against her, and she vanished. But he met her a third\r\ntime, and then, feeling that it could not always be indigestion, he\r\nwrote to his sister in Cheshire, begging her to call upon the Misses\r\nAthelstan, sisters of the clergyman who had held his living before, and\r\nsay what he had seen. When they heard it, the Misses Athelstan looked\r\ninexpressibly distressed and said, ‘That was our mother: we hoped it was\r\nonly to us she would appear. When we were there, she appeared\r\nconstantly, but when we left, we hoped she would be at rest.’\r\n\r\n“About ‘ghost-stories’ I always recollect what Dr. Johnson used to\r\nsay--‘The beginning and end of ghost-stories is this, all argument is\r\nagainst them, all belief is for them.’\r\n\r\n“I have had a charming visit here at Ascot to the Lefevres, the only\r\nother guest being old Mr. Cole of South Kensington, the incarnation of\r\n‘Father Christmas’ or of ‘Old King Cole.’ He talked of the facility of\r\ngetting money and the difficulty of keeping it. He said that when he\r\nwanted money for a Music School, he asked Sir Titus Salt for a\r\nsubscription. Sir Titus asked him what he wanted him to give. ‘Whatever\r\nyou think will look best at the day of judgment,’ said Mr. Cole. Sir\r\nTitus signed a cheque for £1000.\r\n\r\n“Sir John Lefevre described a place in Essex belonging to a Mr. (now Sir\r\nWilliam) and Mrs. Stephenson. When they first went there, the\r\nhousekeeper said there was one room which it was never the custom to\r\nuse. For a long time it continued to be unoccupied, but one day, when\r\nthe house was very full and an unexpected arrival announced, Mrs. S.\r\nsaid she should open and air it, and sent for the key. All the people\r\nstaying in the house, full of curiosity, went with her when she visited\r\nthe room for the first time. It was a large panelled room containing a\r\nbed like a catafalque, with heavy stuff curtains drawn all round. They\r\ndrew aside the curtains, and there was the mark of a bloody hand upon\r\nthe pillow! The room was shut up again from that time forward.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Jan. 22._--George Sheffield is here.

I\r\nalways say that everything has been going to the bad since the pudding\r\nlost its place.’\r\n\r\n“‘Why, what can you mean?’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, in the old days, the good old days, the pudding always used to be\r\nbefore the meat, and then people were not so extravagant at the\r\nbutcher’s. Why, old Mr. Taylor[70] used to say to me, “You know, marm,”\r\nsays he, “we used to tak’ a bit of the dough when the bread was rising,\r\nand slip in an apple or two without peeling ’em, and bake ’em in the\r\noven, and that was our dinner you know, marm.”’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL (The Green Book).\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 25, 1874._--Somehow I have felt as if this volume was closed for\r\never--closed away with the sweet presence which was so long the sunshine\r\nof my life. Yet to-day, while I am alone, sitting once more in the\r\nsacred chamber where I have watched her through so many days and nights,\r\nI feel constrained to write once more.\r\n\r\n“How all is changed to me since then: I can hardly feel as if the two\r\nlives were related--hardly as if they _could_ belong to the same person.\r\n\r\n“Wonderfully, mysteriously, time has healed--no, not healed, but\r\nsoothed, even this wound. At first I felt this must always be\r\nimpossible, life was _too_ blank, but imperceptibly, stealthily, other\r\ninterests asserted their power, and though the old life is always _the_\r\nlife to me, yet I feel all is not over.\r\n\r\n“I have always talked of my Mother, and it has been a great comfort. At\r\nfirst it almost shocked people that I should do it. Perhaps the very\r\nfact of talking and writing about her myself, and her life being now so\r\nmuch talked of by others, has dried up the agony of my own inner\r\ndesolation by force of habitude. Yet, oh, my darling! there is never a\r\nday, seldom an hour, in which I do not think of her; and sometimes when\r\nI am alone,\r\n\r\n    ‘When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,\r\n      I summon up remembrance of things past,’\r\n\r\nI take one of her sketch-books, one of her journals or mine, and with\r\nthem go back into our old life--thus she looked--thus she spoke--thus\r\nshe smiled.\r\n\r\n“At first I was kept up by the sacred work of the ‘Memorials,’ and the\r\nnecessity of fighting against the violent family opposition to them.\r\nThis seemed a duty which rose out of her grave, the one duty for which\r\nI was prepared to sacrifice everything else in the world. I was\r\ndetermined to fulfil it at whatever cost to myself. And I have fulfilled\r\nit--not so well perhaps as I might have done if Arthur and Mary Stanley\r\nhad not tried to trample and stamp all the spirit out of it. They\r\ncondemned the book violently and furiously before they read it, and,\r\nafter reading it, they never had the courage to rescind opinions\r\nexpressed so frequently and publicly. Still, the world says that it is\r\nwell, and it will still keep her lamp burning brightly, so that her\r\nearthly work is not over yet, and she can still guide others heavenward\r\nthrough the darkness. Besides, not only in the ‘Memorials,’ but in all\r\nelse, I have felt the truth of Joseph Mazzini’s advice--‘Get up and\r\nwork; do not set yourself apart. When the Evil One wanted to tempt\r\nJesus, he led Him into a solitude.’\r\n\r\n“I was one winter in Spain with Miss Wright. Then not much more than my\r\nfirst desolate year had passed, and I had still that crushed lacerated\r\nfeeling of utter misery; but I tried to be as bright as I could for my\r\ncompanion’s sake. Last year I was in Italy, and though very ill, and\r\nthough I felt poignantly the first return to the old scenes, it was\r\nbetter, and all old friends were most kind.\r\n\r\n“The dear cousin of my mother’s life, Charlotte Leycester, has been here\r\neach year for some months, and other guests come and go through the\r\nsummer, so that little Holmhurst still gives pleasure.\r\n\r\n“At first I was very, very poor, and it was a struggle to have a home;\r\nbut latterly my books have brought in enough to keep the house, and a\r\ngreat deal to give away besides, which has been most opportune, as\r\nseveral members of the family have sorely needed helping. I have also a\r\nlittle Hospice, where I receive those whom I hear of as in need of\r\nthorough change, mental and physical, for a month, sets of\r\nsunshine-seekers succeeding each other. My dear Lea is still left to me,\r\nand is my greatest comfort, so associated with all that is gone.\r\n\r\n“My books have made me almost well known after a fashion, and people are\r\nvery kind, for, with what Shakspeare calls ‘the excellent foppery of the\r\nworld,’ many who used to snub me now almost ‘make up to me,’ and all\r\nkinds of so-called ‘great people’ invite me to their houses. Sometimes\r\nthis is very pleasant, and I always enjoy being liked. I do not think it\r\nis likely to set me up; I have too strong a feeling of my own real\r\ninferiority to the opinion formed of me. Intellectually, I am so ill\r\ngrounded that I really know nothing well or accurately; and if I am what\r\nis called ‘generous,’ certainly that is no virtue, for it pleases myself\r\nas well as others. I think it is still with me as George Sand says of\r\nherself, ‘Je n’ai pas de bonheur dans la vie, mais j’ai beaucoup de\r\nbonheurs.’\r\n\r\n“To-morrow I am going abroad again. It is almost necessary for my books;\r\nand though I feel bitterly leaving Lea and the little home, I like my\r\nmother’s adopted son to earn a reputation; that is all I care for,\r\nexcept that it is always a pleasure to give pleasure. There is a\r\nsentence, too, of Carlyle’s which comes back to me--‘We are sufficiently\r\napplauded and approved, and ought now, if possible, to go and do\r\nsomething _deserving_ a little applause.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nLITERARY WORK AT HOME AND ABROAD\r\n\r\n     “Ohne Hast, aber ohne Rast.”--GOETHE.\r\n\r\n     “Leisure and I have taken leave of one another.

First, as multiplying the ways and chances\r\n     by which a useful work comes into the hands of such as are prepared\r\n     to avail themselves of it; secondly, as securing for such a work\r\n     that submissiveness of heart, that docility, without which nothing\r\n     really good can be really acquired; and lastly, because the\r\n     individuality of the author, with all the associations connected\r\n     with his name and history, adds greatly to the effect of a\r\n     work.”--COLERIDGE _to_ SIR G.

I had a pleasant dinner at the Embassy, and I\r\nwent to see old Madame Dubois at the top of a house, in her room which\r\nis at once sitting-room, bedroom, and kitchen. She was full of the\r\nwretchedness of living in a country where your servant had no scruple in\r\ntelling you she was your equal, and that she was jealous of your being\r\nricher than herself. She showed her household treasures, especially a\r\nlittle silver owl, ‘qui est restée longtemps sans se marier, et puis a\r\nfait un petit hibou.’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“I left in the evening for my four-and-twenty hours’ journey. The train\r\nwas crowded, every place full, but, in spite of my seven companions and\r\ntheir twenty-eight handbags, which obliged me to sit bolt upright the\r\nwhole way, I rather enjoyed it. There is something so interesting in the\r\nrapid transitions: the plains of Central France: the rolling hills of\r\nBurgundy in the white moonlight: the great towns, Dijon and Lyons, deep\r\ndown below, and mapped out by their lamps: the dawn over the Rhone\r\nvalley: the change to blue sky melting into delicate amber: the first\r\nstunted olives: the white roads leading, dust-surrounded, to the white\r\ncities, Avignon and Tarascon and Arles: the desolate stone-laden Crau:\r\nthe still blue Mediterranean, and Marseilles with its shipping, and then\r\nthe granite phase of southern Provence and its growth of heath and\r\nlavender and pines.\r\n\r\n“On this, the eastern side, Cannes is a new world to me, but on Sunday,\r\nwith Marcus Hare and G., I went up to the other side, to the Villa S.\r\nFrançois and our beloved pine-wood, alive still with sacred memories,\r\nwhere the dear form still might seem to wander with her sunshade and\r\ncamp-stool, and where we sat on the very stone she used to rest on in\r\n‘the Shepherdesses’ Walk.’ G. is too matter of fact to enjoy this\r\ncountry. When I exclaimed over the glorious beauty and variety of the\r\nview of the Rocher de Bilheres, standing out as it does from the supreme\r\npoint of the forest promontory, with the purple shadows behind it in the\r\ndeep rift, she could only say, ‘I should be better satisfied if I could\r\nascertain exactly what it is mineralogically.’\r\n\r\n“I went with Frank de Wesselow to Vallauris, the walk a perfect series\r\nof pictures--the winding road with its glorious sea-views; then, at the\r\nchapel, the opening upon all the Alpine range; then the deep hollow ways\r\noverhung by old gnarled olives, and peopled by peasants with their mules\r\nand baskets.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday I had a visit from George Sutherland, whom I looked after in\r\nhis fever at Rome, full of his spiritualism, of his drawings made under\r\nthe influence of spirits, who ‘squeeze out just the amount of colour to\r\nbe used and no more,’ and of his conversations with his dead mother,\r\nwhom he described as ‘touching him constantly.’\r\n\r\n“In the evening we talked of the De Wesselows’ faithful servant Mrs.\r\nManning, of her wonderful power of making people understand her, and how\r\nher appreciation of foreigners was entirely in proportion to their doing\r\nso. Frank was standing by her one day in the garden when their maid\r\nThérèse passed by. Mrs. Manning said quickly, ‘Teresa, acqua fresca\r\npully, and these things want lavering,’ and, without giving another\r\nmoment’s attention, went on with what she had been doing. Thérèse, in\r\nher slow way, said ‘Yees,’ thinking that she talked English very well,\r\nand understood perfectly that she was to give some water to the chickens\r\nand that the things wanted washing.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Villa Heraud, Cimies, Feb. 6, 1874._--I am writing from a beautiful\r\ncountry villa, where, in sweet Mary Harford,[71] I find the friend of my\r\nchildhood quite unchanged, though it is fifteen years since I have seen\r\nher. In spite of being the mother of six daughters and two sons, she\r\nlooks still as young as the Mary Bunsen who was carried quite helpless\r\ninto Hurstmonceaux Place twenty-three years ago. It is a most united\r\nfamily, and you would admire the ‘way in which the six daughters take\r\narms and sing a hymn behind their mother (who plays) after family\r\nprayers.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Parma, Feb. 12, 1874._--I had so many kind invitations at Nice, I\r\nrather longed to remain there. On Sunday I went home after church with\r\nLady Jocelyn and her little grand-daughter. I had not seen her since the\r\nloss of her children. Her sweet sad face quite haunts me. I said to her,\r\n‘Do you often drive out.’--‘No,’ she said; ‘I must always walk, or else\r\nthe days would be _too_ long.’\r\n\r\n“I had an interesting railway journey on Monday with Madame Franzoni,\r\nwho lives in the house at Taggia described in ‘Dr. Antonio.’ She was\r\nSwiss. Her husband, of an old Swiss-Italian family, was disinherited on\r\nbecoming Protestant, and was obliged to become an engineer. His father,\r\nstill living, has been prevented by his priests from speaking to him for\r\nfive-and-twenty years, though devotedly fond of him. She took her two\r\nlittle children and made them sing a hymn beneath the tree in which\r\ntheir grandfather was sitting. Tears streamed down the old man’s cheeks,\r\nbut he would not look at them; he said it must be a lesson to his other\r\nchildren. The mother offered her whole fortune if her son would consent\r\nto hear one mass; she believed that one mass would reconvert him. Since\r\nthen the Protestant part of the family have been dreadfully poor, whilst\r\nthe rest are immensely rich. Madame Franzoni said that the priests of\r\nTaggia were very kind to them privately, but would not recognise them in\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAMPEDUSA FROM TAGGIA.][72]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STAIRCASE, PALAZZO DELL’ UNIVERSITA, GENOA][73]\r\n\r\n“When we parted, I gave her my card. Some Americans in the carriage saw\r\nit and almost flew into my arms. ‘Oh, the “Quiet Life”--too great\r\nhappiness,’ &c. Afterwards I had a warning to be careful what subjects\r\none touched upon with strangers, for I said something about the loss of\r\nthe _Ville de Havre_. The lady (Mrs. Colt) burst into tears, and her\r\ndaughter said, ‘Mother’s brother was the judge who was lost; he would\r\nnot leave his wife, and went down with her in his arms, saying, “Let us\r\ndie bravely!”’ Afterwards at Genoa I met a young lady (Miss Bulkeley)\r\nwho went down with her mother. The mother was lost. As the daughter\r\nrose, something hurt her head; she put her hand to it and caught a\r\nchain, and finding her head above water, called, ‘A woman! help!’ She\r\nheard men say, ‘American sailors are saving you,’ but became unconscious\r\nand knew nothing for long afterwards. She said it was quite a mistake to\r\nsay drowning was painless--the oppression on the lungs was agony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLOISTER OF S. MATTEO, GENOA.][74]\r\n\r\n“I enjoyed Genoa and my work there, and made several pleasant Italian\r\nacquaintances, the Genoese are so hospitable. The Marchese Spinola\r\nshowed me all the treasures and pictures of his old palace himself. I\r\nsuppose I must take this as a great compliment, for I was amused the\r\nother day by an anecdote of the Marchesa Spinola, who made herself most\r\nagreeable to an Englishman she met at the Baths of Monte Catini. On\r\ntaking leave, he politely expressed a hope that, as they were both going\r\nto Rome in the winter, they might meet there. ‘Mais non, Monsieur,’ she\r\nreplied; ‘à Monte Catini je suis charmée de vous voir, mais à Rome c’est\r\ntoute autre chose.’ Yesterday I spent in correcting my account of\r\nPiacenza--bitterly cold, children sliding all over the streets, which\r\nwere one mass of ice.... I had forgotten the intense interest of Parma\r\nand its glorious pictures, especially what a grand master Pordenone\r\nwas.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_59 B. Mario de’ Fiori, Rome, Feb. 22._--Rome is fearfully modernised,\r\nsuch quantities of new houses built, such quantities of old buildings\r\nswept away--the old shell fountain in the Felice, the lion of the\r\nApostoli, the Vintner’s fountain at Palazzo Simonetti, the ruins of the\r\nPonte Salara, and ... all the shrines in the Coliseum, even the famous\r\ncross on the wall. The last nearly caused a Revolution. On the Pincio a\r\nSwiss cottage is put up, strangely out of place amongst the old statues,\r\nand a clock which goes by water. Even the most ardent Protestants too\r\nare a little shocked that the famous Quirinal Chapel, so redolent of\r\nChurch history, should be turned into a cloak-room for balls, and the\r\ncloak-tickets kept in the holy water basins. The poverty and suffering\r\namongst the Romans is dreadful, the great influx of Torinese taking the\r\nbread out of their mouths.\r\n\r\n“You would be amused with the economy of my servants Ambrogio and Maria.\r\nThey think it most extravagant if I have both vegetables and a pudding,\r\nand quite sinful to have soup the same day; and the first day, after I\r\nhad seen the kitchen fire blazing away all afternoon, and ‘Il Signorino\r\nè servito’ was announced very magnificently, behold the dinner\r\nwas--three larks! But what a pleasure it is to hear again from\r\nservants--‘Felicissima notte,’--that sweetest bidding of repose, as\r\nPalgrave calls it.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 1._--I know, as usual, far too many people here for comfort,\r\nnearly three hundred.

Nothing can exceed the tastelessness of all that is being\r\ndone--the Coliseum, Baths of Caracalla, and the temples are scraped\r\nquite clean, and look like sham ruins built yesterday: all the pretty\r\ntrees are cut down: the outsides of the mediæval churches (Prassede,\r\nPudentiana, &c.) are washed yellow or painted over: the old fountains\r\nare stripped of their ferns and polished: the Via Crucis and other\r\nprocessions are forbidden: and the Government has even sent out the\r\n‘pompieri’ to cut down all the ivy from the aqueducts. I have, however,\r\ngot back one thing--the Lion of the Apostoli! I went round to a number\r\nof people living in that neighbourhood, and engaged them to go in the\r\nmorning to the Senators in the Capitol and demand its restoration: and a\r\nmessage was sent that the lion should be restored at once. So the little\r\nhideous beast goes back this week to his little vacant sofa, where he\r\nhas sat for more than six hundred years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLONNA CASTLE, PALESTRINA.][76]\r\n\r\n“The cardinals have been dying off a good deal lately, and a curious\r\nrelic of old times was the lying in state of Cardinal Bernabo in the\r\nPropaganda Fide--the chapel hung with black, the catafalque with cloth\r\nof gold, a chain of old abbots and cardinals standing and kneeling round\r\nwith tapers, and all the students singing. Pius IX. is well, and\r\nAntonelli has never been the least ill, except in the _Times_, in which\r\nhe has received the last sacraments.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENAZZANO.][77]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUBIACO.][78]\r\n\r\n“_Tivoli, March 22._--I have been greatly enjoying a little mountain\r\ntour with Lady Castletown and Mrs. Lewis Wingfield. On Wednesday we\r\nspent the day in the villas Aldobrandini and Mondragone at Frascati, and\r\nthe next morning had the most charming drive by Monte Porzio and Monte\r\nCompatri, chiefly through the desolate chestnut forests, to Palestrina.\r\nIt was the fair of Genazzano, and the whole road was most animated, such\r\ncrowds of peasants in their gayest costumes and prettiest ornaments. At\r\nbeautiful Olevano we had just time to go to the little inn and visit my\r\nfriend of last year, Peppina Baldi. It was a tiring journey thence to\r\nSubiaco after such a long day, and we only passed the worst precipices\r\nby daylight, so it was quite dark when we reached Subiaco, where we\r\nfound rooms with difficulty, as, quite unwittingly, we had arrived on\r\nthe eve of the great festa of S. Benedetto. Most delighted we were,\r\nhowever, of course, and most picturesque and beautiful was the early\r\npilgrimage, with bands of music and singing, up the stony mountain\r\npaths. Lady Castletown travels with a second carriage for her maids, so\r\nprices naturally rise at first sight of so grand a princess.... On the\r\nway here we diverged to the farm of Horace in the Licenza valley, all\r\nmarvellously unaltered--the brook, the meadows, the vines, the\r\nsurrounding hills and villages, still just as he described them eighteen\r\nhundred years ago. It is a wonderful country, one lives so entirely in\r\nthe past.”\r\n\r\nI have seldom enjoyed Tivoli more than in this spring of 1874. It was\r\nthen that, sitting in the scene I describe, I wrote the paragraph of\r\n“Days near Rome” which I insert here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SACRO SPECO, SUBIACO.][79]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Nothing can exceed the loveliness of the views from the road which\r\nleads from Tivoli by the chapel of S. Antonio to the Madonna di\r\nQuintiliolo. On the opposite height rises the town with its temples,\r\nits old houses and churches clinging to the edge of the cliffs, which\r\nare overhung with such a wealth of luxuriant vegetation as is almost\r\nindescribable; and beyond, beneath the huge pile of building known as\r\nthe Villa of Maecenas, the thousand noisy cataracts of the Cascatelle\r\nleap forth beneath the old masonry, and sparkle and dance and foam\r\nthrough the green--and all this is only the foreground to vast distances\r\nof dreamy campagna, seen through the gnarled hoary stems of grand old\r\nolive-trees--rainbow-hued with every delicate tint of emerald and\r\namethyst, and melting into sapphire, where the solitary dome of St.\r\nPeter’s rises, invincible by distance, over the level line of the\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S. MARIA DI COLLEMAGGIO, AQUILA.][80]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOLMONA.][81]\r\n\r\n“And the beauty is not confined to the views alone. Each turn of the\r\nwinding road is a picture; deep ravines of solemn dark-green olives\r\nwhich waken into silver light as the wind shakes their leaves--old\r\nconvents and chapels buried in shady nooks on the\r\nmountain-side--thickets of laurustinus, roses, genista, and\r\njessamine--banks of lilies and hyacinths, anemones and violets--grand\r\nmasses of grey rock, up which white-bearded goats are scrambling to\r\nnibble the myrtle and rosemary, and knocking down showers of the red\r\ntufa on their way;--and a road, with stone seats and parapets, twisting\r\nalong the edge of the hill through a constant diorama of loveliness, and\r\npeopled by groups of peasants in their gay dresses returning from their\r\nwork, singing in parts wild canzonetti which echo amid the silent hills,\r\nor by women washing at the wayside fountains, or returning with brazen\r\n_conche_ poised upon their heads, like stately statues of\r\nwater-goddesses wakened into life.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGreat was the difficulty of securing any companion for the desolate\r\nexcursion to the Abruzzi, but at length I found a clever artist, Mr.\r\nDonne, who agreed to go with me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HERMITAGE OF PIETRO MURRONE.][82]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASTLE OF AVEZZANO.][83]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATE OF ARPINUM.][84]\r\n\r\n“_Sora in the Marsica, April 2._--Mr. Donne and I left the train at\r\nTerni, taking diligence to Rieti, the capital of the Sabina. Next day we\r\nhad a long dreary drive to Aquila, a dismal place, but full of curious\r\nremains, surrounded by tremendous snow mountains. Thence we crossed a\r\nfearful pass in ghastly barren mountains to Solmona, a wonderful\r\nmediæval city seldom visited. On Sunday we clambered up the mountains\r\nabove the town to the hermitage of Pietro Murrone, afterwards\r\nCœlestine V., and then, as the snow was too deep to make it possible\r\nto cross the mountain, returned by night to Aquila. On Tuesday our\r\njourney of a whole day was through perfectly Lapland scenery, the road a\r\nmere track in the deep snow, which covered hedges and fields alike.\r\nFortunately the weather was lovely, but it was a relief to come down\r\nagain to even partial civilisation at Avezzano, on the borders of what\r\nwas once the Lago Fucino, now dried up and spoilt by Prince Torlonia.\r\nHere I had an introduction to Count and Countess Restà, to whom I paid\r\na most curious visit. On Wednesday we drew at S. Maria di Luco, a\r\npicturesque church on the site of a temple above the lake, and in the\r\nevening came on here, arriving at 2 A.M.--glorious moonlight and grand\r\nscenery, but the diligence unspeakably wretched. We have just been\r\nspending a charming day, partly at Arpino, the birthplace of Cicero,\r\nwhere there are wonderful Pelasgic remains, and a gateway which is the\r\noldest architectural monument in Europe, and partly at Cicero’s island\r\nhome on the Liris, a lovely place, all primroses and violets as in\r\nEngland, but with a background of snow mountains.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRIUMPHAL ARCH, AQUINO.][85]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTO S.

Germano, and we have been\r\nspending to-day in the monastery of Monte Cassino, gloriously beautiful\r\nalways, with its palatial buildings on a mountain-top, and all around\r\nbillows of purple hill tipped with snow. An introduction from the Duke\r\nof Sermoneta caused the gentle-looking Abbot to receive us, and then the\r\ngreat bent figure of the great Tosti came forward, his deep-set eyes\r\nexcessively striking. After the service in the church they entertained\r\nus to an excellent dinner, finishing with delicious Aleatico wine. They\r\nwere ‘_spogliati_,’ they said, but ‘_La Providenza_’ still watched over\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_April 7._--In the second-class carriage of the train on our way to\r\nVelletri sat a venerable and beautiful old man, to whom we talked of\r\nAquino, the birthplace of St. Thomas Aquinas, where we spent yesterday.\r\nGradually we found out that he was the Abbot of Monte Vergine, and he\r\ntold us much that was interesting about that wonderful place--of the\r\nintense love and veneration of the Neapolitan people for the sanctuary,\r\nwhich is connected with the different events of their domestic life;\r\nthat no betrothal or marriage or birth was considered entirely\r\nconsecrated without receiving a benediction at the sanctuary; that\r\npeasant women had it entered in their marriage contracts that they\r\nshould be allowed to make the pilgrimage from time to time, and after\r\nthe birth of each child; that because, on account of the suppression,\r\ntwo miles of the road to the sanctuary still remained unfinished, the\r\npeasants voluntarily undertook to finish it themselves, 30,000 persons\r\nsubscribing one soldo apiece; that when, at the same time, he, the\r\nAbbot, was obliged to give up keeping a carriage, five Neapolitan\r\nfamilies insisted upon undertaking to keep one for him, one paying the\r\nhorses, another the coachman, &c. The Abbot gave us his benediction on\r\ntaking leave, and invited us to Monte Vergine.”[88]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_April 14._--I met Mademoiselle von Raasloff at Mrs. Terry’s. She\r\nnarrated to me some facts which had been told to her by the well-known\r\nDr. Pereira.\r\n\r\n“An acquaintance of his, a lady, was travelling with some friends in an\r\nout-of-the-way part of Poland. Suddenly, late at night, their carriage\r\nbroke down and they were obliged to get out, and as they knew of no\r\nshelter near, they were in great difficulties. At this juncture a\r\ngentleman appeared, who said to the lady that if she would take the\r\ntrouble to walk a few steps farther, she would come to the gate of his\r\nhouse; that he was unable to accompany her, but that if she would\r\nmention his name she would be received, and would find all she required.\r\nShe thanked him and followed his directions. The servant to whom she\r\nspoke at the house seemed very much surprised, but seeing her plight,\r\nbrought her in, left her in a library, and went to get some refreshment.\r\nWhen she was alone, a door in the panelling opened and the unknown\r\nmaster of the house came in and sat down by her. As he said nothing, she\r\nfelt rather awkward, and more so when the servant, coming in with a\r\ntray, seemed to brush up close to him in a very odd way as he set it\r\ndown. When the servant left the room, the unknown said, ‘Ne vous étonnez\r\npas, Mademoiselle, c’est que je suis mort;’ and he proceeded to say that\r\nhe was most thankful she had come, and that he wished her to make him a\r\nsolemn promise; that the people who were now in possession of the\r\nproperty were not the rightful heirs, but that he had left a will,\r\ndeposited with a certain lawyer in a certain place, the name of which he\r\nmade her write down. She listened as in a trance, but did as she was\r\nbid. The servant, coming in again about this time, walked straight\r\n_through_ the unknown. Presently the carriage, being mended, was\r\nannounced to be at the door, upon which the unknown walked with her to\r\nthe porch, bowed, and disappeared.\r\n\r\n“When the lady got to Warsaw, she had an _attaque des nerfs_, was very\r\nill, and sent for Dr. Pereira. She told him all she had seen, and also\r\ngave him the paper with the directions she had written down. Dr.\r\nPereira, finding that the person and place mentioned really existed,\r\ninquired into the matter, and the result was that the will was found,\r\nthe wrongful possessors ejected, and the rightful owners set up in their\r\nplace.”\r\n\r\n“One evening at the Palazzo Odescalchi, when everybody had been telling\r\nstories, and nothing very interesting, Mademoiselle von Raasloff\r\nsuddenly astonished us by saying, ‘Now I will tell you something.’ Then\r\nshe said--\r\n\r\n“There was a young lady in Denmark, whose family, from circumstances,\r\nhad lived very much before the Danish world, and with whom, in so small\r\na society as that of Copenhagen, almost every one was acquainted.\r\nConsequently it was a subject of interest, almost of universal interest,\r\nat Copenhagen, when it became known that this young lady, with the full\r\napproval of her parents and joyful consent of every one concerned, had\r\nbecome engaged to a young Danish officer of good family and position.\r\n\r\n“‘Now in Danish society a betrothal is considered to be almost the same\r\nthing as a marriage: new relationships date from that time, and if\r\neither the affianced bride or bridegroom die, the family of the other\r\nside mourn as for a son or brother, as if the marriage had actually\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\n“‘While this young lady of whom I have spoken was only engaged, her\r\nbetrothed husband was summoned to join his regiment in a war which was\r\ngoing on; and very soon to the house of his betrothed came the terrible\r\nnews that he was dead, that he was killed in battle. And the way in\r\nwhich the news came was this. A soldier of his regiment was wounded and\r\nwas taken prisoner; and as he was lying in his cot in the hospital, he\r\nsaid to his companion who was in the next bed, “I saw the young\r\nColonel--I saw the young Colonel on his white horse, and he rode into\r\nthe ranks of the enemy and he never came back again.” And the man who\r\nsaid that died, but the man to whom he said it recovered, and, in\r\nprocess of time, he was ransomed, and came back to Copenhagen and told\r\nhis story with additions. “My comrade, who is dead, said that he saw the\r\nyoung Colonel on his white horse, and that he saw him ride into the\r\nranks of the enemy and the soldiers of the enemy drag him from his horse\r\nand kill him, so that he never came back again.” This was the form in\r\nwhich the story reached the family of the affianced wife of the young\r\nColonel, and they mourned him most truly; for they loved him much, and\r\nthey put on all the outward signs of deepest grief. There was only one\r\nperson who would not put on the outward signs of mourning, and that was\r\nhis affianced bride herself. She said, and persisted in saying, that she\r\n_could_ not believe that, where two persons had been as entirely united\r\nas she and her betrothed had been, one could pass entirely out of life\r\nwithout the other knowing it. That her lover was sick, in prison, in\r\ntrouble, she could believe, but that he was dead--_never_, without her\r\nhaving an inner conviction of it; and she would not put on the outward\r\nsigns of mourning, which to her sense implied an impression of ill omen.\r\nHer parents urged her greatly, not only because their own reality of\r\ngrief was very great, but because, according to the feeling of things in\r\nCopenhagen, it cast a very great slur upon their daughter that she\r\nshould appear without the usual signs of grief. They urged her\r\nceaselessly, and the tension of mind in which she lived, and the\r\nperpetual struggle with her own family, added to her own deep grief, had\r\na very serious effect upon her.\r\n\r\n“‘It was while things were in this state that one day she dreamt--she\r\ndreamt that she received a letter from her betrothed, and in her dream\r\nshe felt that it was of the most vital importance that she should see\r\nthe date of that letter; and she struggled and laboured to see it, but\r\nshe could not make it out; and she laboured on with the utmost intensity\r\nof effort, but she could not decipher it; and it seemed to her the most\r\nwearisome night she had ever spent, so incessant was her effort, but she\r\ncould not read it: still she would not give it up, and at last, just as\r\nthe dawn was breaking, she saw the date of the letter, and it was May\r\nthe 10th. The effort was so great that she woke; but the date remained\r\nwith her still--it was May the 10th.\r\n\r\n“‘Now she knew that if such a letter had been really written on the 10th\r\nof May, by the 1st of June she must receive that letter.\r\n\r\n“‘The next morning, when her father came in to see her before she was\r\nup, as he had always done since their great sorrow, he was surprised to\r\nfind her not only calm and serene, but almost radiant. She said, “You\r\nhave often blamed me for not wearing the outward signs of mourning for\r\nmy betrothed: grant me now only till the 1st of June, and _then_, if I\r\nreceive no letter from him, I will promise to resign myself to believe\r\nthe worst, and I will do as you desire.” Three weeks of terrible tension\r\nensued, and the 1st of June arrived. She said then that she felt as if\r\nher whole future life hung upon the postman’s knock. It came--and there\r\nwas the letter! Her lover had been taken prisoner, communication with\r\nhim had been cut off--in fact, till then it was impossible she should\r\nhear. Soon afterwards he was exchanged, came home, and they were\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\n“‘Now,’ said Mademoiselle von Raasloff, as she finished her narrative,\r\n‘that is no story which I have heard. The young lady was my dear mother;\r\nshe is here to testify to it: the young officer was my dear father,\r\nGeneral von Raasloff; he is here to confirm it.’ And they were both\r\npresent.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_April 15._--There is a pretty young American lady at the\r\n_table-d’hôte_--most amusing. Here are some snatches from her lips:--\r\n\r\n“‘I wonder if the old masters who painted such absurd figures of saints\r\nand angels _meant_ to be funny, or if they were only funny by mistake.’\r\n\r\n“‘Pity is like eating mustard without beef, and you wouldn’t like that,\r\nwould you?’\r\n\r\n“‘I was at a pension at Castellamare--Miss Baker’s. Avoid it. There\r\nwere places for fifty at dinner, and forty-nine of them were old maids.\r\nNo gentleman stayed--of course he couldn’t: they would have gobbled him\r\nup alive.’\r\n\r\n“‘I went to the Trinità to hear the nuns sing. The nun who opened the\r\ndoor said, “You’re too late!”--“Well,” I said, “you declared I was too\r\nearly yesterday. When _am_ I to come?”--“Well, I don’t know,” she said;\r\n“we’re always changing.”--“Well, you _are_ a civil old party, _you_\r\nare,” I said--and the old tigress actually slammed the door in my face.’\r\n\r\n“‘Somebody said to me about a nigger I was abusing that I shouldn’t,\r\nbecause he was a man and a brother. “Well, sir, he may be your brother,”\r\nI said, “but most certainly he is not mine.” I should think not indeed,\r\nwith a leg that comes down in the middle of his foot.’\r\n\r\n“‘I shall be burnt, I hope, when I die. I feel like the old lady I heard\r\nof the other day who knew she was getting immensely old and could not\r\nlive long, so paid down three thousand dollars to have a good big stove\r\nmade right off at once.’\r\n\r\n“‘I hope when I’m dying my people won’t be able to go on pegging away at\r\ntheir dinner just as if nothing was happening: I should not like that at\r\nall.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FARFA.][89]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATE OF CASAMARI.][90]\r\n\r\n“_Assisi, April 26._--I had a proposal from the Miss Seymours and Miss\r\nEllis that if I would wait at Rome till Saturday the 18th, they would\r\nset off with me in search of the lost monastery of Farfa, which was, of\r\nall places, the one I wanted most to see, and from which fear of\r\nbrigands had previously caused all my companions to fail at the last\r\nmoment. If you have read any old histories of Italy, you will remember\r\nhow all-important Farfa was in the Middle Ages, and will wonder that no\r\none, not even the best Roman antiquarians, knew anything about its\r\npresent state, or even where it is. We could only judge by old maps and\r\nchronicles. However, the excursion completely answered, and, after\r\ndivers little adventures, which ‘Days near Rome’ will narrate, we not\r\nonly arrived at Farfa, but found the Father-General of the Benedictines\r\naccidentally there to receive us. Greatly astonished he was at our\r\narrival, but said that one enterprising stranger had reached the place\r\nthree years before--I need hardly add, an English lady. Really Farfa is\r\none of the most radiant spots in Italy, and the sheets of wild-flowers,\r\nand the songs of nightingales and cuckoos enhanced its charms. My\r\ncompanions were so delighted that they consented, if I would stay till\r\nWednesday, to set off again on a long, wild, and very rough tourette to\r\nthe monasteries of the Hernican mountains. So on the 22nd we went by\r\nrail to Frosinone, and thence drove to Casamari, going on by a grand\r\nmountain road to sleep at Alatri. The next day we rode up a jagged rock\r\npath for many hours to the Carthusian Trisulti, a huge monastery in a\r\nmountain forest, amid Alpine flowers and close under the snows. Then we\r\nsaw the famous Grottoes of Collepardo--a sort of underground Staffa,\r\nvery grand indeed, and returned at night to Frosinone, and next day to\r\nRome.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_May 4, Florence._--General von Raasloff is here, and says that a\r\nfriend of his going to China received endless commissions for things he\r\nwas to bring home, but that only one of the people who gave them sent\r\nmoney for the things they wanted. On his return, this commission was the\r\nonly one he had fulfilled. His disappointed friends upbraided him, and\r\nhe said, ‘You see it was very unfortunate, but when we were nearing\r\nChina, I spread out all my different commissions on the deck that I\r\nmight examine them, and I put the money for each on the paper to which\r\nit belonged: and--it was very unfortunate, but my attention was called\r\naway for an instant, and behold a great gust of wind had come, and all\r\nthose commissions which were not weighted by money had been blown far\r\nout to sea, and I never saw them again.’\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle von Raasloff told me that--\r\n\r\n“Count Piper, an ancestor of the present Count Piper, was a very\r\ndetermined gambler. Being once at one of his desolate country estates,\r\nhe was in perfect despair for some one to play with him, but he was\r\nalone. At last, in a fit of desperation, he said, ‘If the devil himself\r\nwere to come to play with me, I should be grateful.’ Soon a tremendous\r\nstorm began to rage, during which a servant came in and said that a\r\ngentleman overtaken by night was travelling past, and implored shelter.\r\nCount Piper was quite enchanted, and a very gentlemanlike man was shown\r\nin. Supper was served, and then Count Piper proposed a game of cards, in\r\nwhich the stranger at once acquiesced. Count Piper won so enormously,\r\nthat he felt quite ashamed, and at last he proposed their retiring. As\r\nthey were leaving the room, the stranger said, ‘I am very much concerned\r\nthat I have not sufficient money with me to pay all my debt now;\r\nhowever, I shall beg you to take my ring as a guarantee, which is really\r\nof greater value than the money, and which has very peculiar properties,\r\none of which is that as long as you wear it, all you possess is safe\r\nfrom fire.’ The Count took the ring, and escorting the stranger to his\r\nroom, wished him good-night. The next morning he sent to inquire after\r\nhim: he was not there, his bed had not been slept in, and he never was\r\nheard of again. Count Piper wore the ring, but after some time, as it\r\nwas very heavy and old-fashioned, he took it off and put it away. The\r\nnext morning came the news that one of his finest farm-houses had been\r\nburnt down. And so it always is in that family. The descendants of Count\r\nPiper always have to wear the ring, and if ever they leave it off for a\r\nsingle day, one of their houses on one of their great estates is burnt.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Florence, May 10._--Ten days here in the radiant spring-tide have been\r\nvery delightful. I have seen a great deal of Mrs. Ross, Lady Duff\r\nGordon’s beautiful daughter, who is now writing the story of her\r\nmother’s life. She has a noble head, which is almost more full of\r\nexpression than that of any one I know, and I am sure that her character\r\nis noble too, with all the smallnesses of life, which make a thoroughly\r\nanglicised character ignoble, washed out, and its higher qualities\r\nremaining to be mingled with the Italian frankness and kindly simplicity\r\nwhich _English_-English do not possess, and consequently cannot\r\nunderstand. Her singing to a guitar is capital--chiefly of Italian\r\n_stornelli_, rendered with all the _verve_ which a _contadina_ herself\r\ncould give them. It is no wonder that Italians adore her. Each summer\r\nshe and her husband spend at Castagnuolo with the Marchese Lotteria\r\ndella Stufa, the great friend of her father, who died in his arms. This\r\nis ‘Il Marchese’ _par excellence_ with the Florentines, to whom he is\r\npublic property. When a child accidentally shot him with a pistol\r\nthrough the crown of his hat, thousands of people thronged the street\r\nbefore his house to inquire, and in all the villages round his native\r\nvalley of Signa the price of wax went up for a fortnight, so many\r\ncandles were burnt to the Madonna as thank-offerings for his escape. The\r\nnext day, as he was crossing one of the bridges, he met Giacomo, a\r\nflyman he knew, driving a carriage full of very respectable old Scotch\r\nladies. Giacomo flung his reins on the box, and rushing up to the\r\nMarchese, threw himself sobbing on his breast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA BADIA DI SETTIMO.][91]\r\n\r\n“I have been out with Mrs. Ross to the Stufa villa of Castagnuolo, seven\r\nmiles off, near the Badia di’ Settimo, in a tiny _baroccino_, drawn by\r\nTocco, the smallest of spirited ponies, and with Picco, the weest\r\nterrier ever seen, upon our knees. As we turned up from the highroad to\r\nthe villa on the hills through the rich luxuriant vineyards, the warmest\r\nwelcome met us from all the peasants, and Mrs. Ross received them with\r\n‘Ah, caro Maso, e come va la moglie,’--‘Addio, caro Guido mio.’ In a\r\nhouse in the grounds--a ‘_podere_’--the whole family of inmates thronged\r\nround her with ‘Vi pigliero un consiglio, Signora,’ about a sick child.\r\nWe wandered up the woods, gathering lovely wild orchids, and then went\r\nto the farm, where the creatures, like the people, seemed to regard Mrs.\r\nRoss as one of themselves: the cows came and licked her, the sheep came\r\nand rubbed against her, the pigeons perched, and even the wild boars\r\nwere gentleness itself. She was first able to make her way at\r\nCastagnuolo by nursing day and night an old _contadino_ who died in her\r\narms. She described comically, though pathetically, the frantic grief\r\nwhich ensued: how the son, Antonio, tried to drown himself, and was\r\npulled out of the water by his breeches: how the whole family insisted\r\nupon being bled: how a married daughter, a niece, and a cousin came and\r\nhad strong convulsions; and how, when she ventured to leave them for a\r\nlittle to go to her dinner, the _fattore_ rushed after her with--‘Ma\r\nSignora, _tutte_ le donne son svenute;’[92] how eventually she locked up\r\neach separately for the night with a basin of soup, having made them a\r\nlittle speech, &c. Whenever any of the _contadini_ have burns, they are\r\ncured by poultices of arum-leaves.\r\n\r\n“All is simple, graceful goodness at Castagnuolo.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Venice, May._--I feel that I am now learning much about masters I\r\nnever knew before. One is introduced to them at one place and continues\r\nthe acquaintance at another, till one becomes really intimate. Marco\r\nBasaiti is the best of these new friends, with his sad shadowy figures\r\nalways painted against an afterglow. One learns how, as Savonarola says,\r\n‘every painter paints himself. However varied his subjects, his works\r\nbear the sign-manual of his thought.’[93]\r\n\r\n“At Milan, on the Eve of S. Ambrogio, an American next me at the\r\n_table-d’hôte_ said to his neighbour opposite, ‘I have been, Marm, to\r\nsee St. Ambrose; and I say, Marm, do you know that to-morrow they are\r\ngoing to tootle the old gentleman all round the town?’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT MILAN.][94]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PARAY LE MONIAL.][95]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn returning from Italy this year I made the excursion to the curious\r\nshrine of Paray le Monial which I have described in an article in\r\n_Evening Hours_. All the time I had been abroad, as during my tour in\r\nSpain, I had sent monthly articles to _Good Words_, for which I was paid\r\nat the rate of five guineas a page--a sum, I believe, given besides only\r\nto Dean Alford and Arthur Stanley. But those were the palmy days of the\r\nmagazine. I was paid much less afterwards, till it came down to a fifth\r\nof that sum. I spent the rest of the summer in London. It was during\r\nthis year that I became a member of the Athenæum Club--an incalculable\r\nadvantage. Twelve years before, old Dr. Hawtrey, the Provost of Eton,\r\nhad said to me, “You ought to be a member of the Athenæum,” and I had\r\nanswered “Then I wish you would propose me.” But I had quite forgotten\r\nabout this, and had never known that the kind old man, long since dead,\r\nhad really done it; so the news that my name was just coming up for\r\nballot was a joyful surprise. I have since spent every London morning in\r\nsteady work at the Athenæum, less disturbed there than even at\r\nHolmhurst. The difficulties which the club rules throw in the way of\r\nreceiving visitors are a great advantage to students, and my life at the\r\nAthenæum has been as regular as clockwork. At breakfast I have always\r\noccupied the same table,--behind the door leading to the kitchen, the\r\none which, I believe, was always formerly used by Wilberforce. In the\r\nafternoons, when all the old gentlemen arrive, to poke up huge fires in\r\nwinter and close all the windows in summer, I have never returned to the\r\nclub.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n_“London, June (in the Park)._--_Fine Lady._--‘How strange it is to see\r\nall these smart carriages driving about and nobody in them.’\r\n\r\n“_My simple self._--‘Nobody in them! why, they are quite full of\r\npeople.’\r\n\r\n“_Fine Lady._--‘Ah, ye-es--_people_, but nobody all the same. _We_ never\r\ndrive in the Park now.

She talked of spiritualism--how she had been to a meeting\r\nat Mrs. Gregory’s--‘a truthful woman, who would not stand imposture if\r\nshe knew it.’ She ‘cottoned’ up the medium, ‘parcequ’il faut mieux\r\ns’adresser à Dieu qu’à ses saints.’ They sat in the dark, which was\r\ndepressing. Soon after she felt a shock ‘like a torpedo,’ and something\r\nlike the leg of a chair came and scratched her head. A voice called her\r\nand said, ‘I am John King, and I want you, Madame du Quaire; I have got\r\nsomething for you.’ ‘Then,’ said Madame du Q., ‘he gave me a sort of\r\nchain of sharks’ teeth; the kind of thing of which, when it was given to\r\nsome one at Honolulu, the recipient inquired, “C’est un collier?”--“Mais\r\npardon,” said the donor, “c’est une robe.”’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 24._--I dined with Lord Ravensworth at Percy’s Cross, and he told\r\nme--\r\n\r\n“When I was a young man, I was staying at Balnagowan with Lady Mary\r\nRoss. She had a son and daughter. The daughter was a very handsome,\r\ncharming girl. One day I was walking with her, and she told me that when\r\nher brother was ill of the measles, at their other place, Bonnington,\r\nwhere the Falls of the Clyde are, an old nurse who lived at the lodge\r\nsome way off used to come up and sit by him in the day, returning home\r\nat night. One morning when she arrived, she was most dreadfully\r\ndepressed, and being questioned as to the cause, said, ‘I am na lang for\r\nthis warld; and not only me, but a greater than I is na lang for this\r\nwarld--and that is the head o’ this hoose.’ And she said that as she was\r\nwalking home, two lights came out of the larches and flitted before her:\r\none was a feeble light, close to the ground; the other a large bright\r\nlight higher up. They passed before her to the park gates and then\r\ndisappeared. ‘And,’ she said, ‘I know that the feeble light is myself,\r\nand the greater light is the head o’ this hoose.’\r\n\r\n“A few days afterwards the old woman took a cold and died, and within a\r\nfortnight Sir C. Ross died too,[98] while the little boy recovered and\r\nis alive still.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptain Fisher, who is engaged to be married to Victoria Liddell, told\r\nme that--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n‘When Mr. Macpherson of Glen Truim was dying, his wife had gone to rest\r\nin a room looking out over the park, and sat near the window. Suddenly\r\nshe saw lights as of a carriage coming in at the distant lodge-gate, and\r\ncalling to one of the servants, said, ‘Do go down; some one is coming\r\nwho does not know of all this grief.’ But the servant remained near her\r\nat the window, and as the carriage came near the house, they saw it was\r\na hearse drawn by four horses and covered with figures. As it stopped at\r\nthe porch door, the figures looked up at her, and their eyes glared with\r\nlight; then they scrambled down and seemed to disappear into the house.\r\nSoon they reappeared and seemed to lift some heavy weight into the\r\nhearse, which then drove off at full speed, causing all the stones and\r\ngravel to fly up at the windows. Mrs. Macpherson and the butler had not\r\nrallied from their horror and astonishment, when the nurse watching in\r\nthe next room came in to tell her that the Colonel was dead.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“I was surprised to hear that Mrs. Hungerford was in London, and asked\r\nwhy she had left Ireland so unexpectedly. I was told she had had a great\r\nfright--then I heard what it was.\r\n\r\n“She was in her room in the evening in her beautiful house, which looks\r\nout upon a lake, beyond which rise hills wooded with fir-trees.\r\nSuddenly, on the opposite side of the lake, she saw a form which\r\nseemed--with sweeping garments--to move forward upon the water. It was\r\ngigantic. Mrs. Hungerford screamed, and her sister, Miss Cropper (who\r\nafterwards married Mr. Jerome), and the nurse came to her from the inner\r\nnursery. The three remained at the window for some time, but retreated\r\nas the figure advanced, and at length--being then so tall that it\r\nreached to the second floor--looked in at the window, and disclosed the\r\nmost awful face of a hideous old woman.\r\n\r\n“It was a Banshee, and one of the family died immediately afterwards.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptain Fisher also told us this really extraordinary story connected\r\nwith his own family:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Fisher may sound a very plebeian name, but this family is of very\r\nancient lineage, and for many hundreds of years they have possessed a\r\nvery curious old place in Cumberland, which bears the weird name of\r\nCroglin Grange. The great characteristic of the house is that never at\r\nany period of its very long existence has it been more than one story\r\nhigh, but it has a terrace from which large grounds sweep away towards\r\nthe church in the hollow, and a fine distant view.\r\n\r\n“When, in lapse of years, the Fishers outgrew Croglin Grange in family\r\nand fortune, they were wise enough not to destroy the long-standing\r\ncharacteristic of the place by adding another story to the house, but\r\nthey went away to the south, to reside at Thorncombe near Guildford, and\r\nthey let Croglin Grange.\r\n\r\n“They were extremely fortunate in their tenants, two brothers and a\r\nsister. They heard their praises from all quarters. To their poorer\r\nneighbours they were all that is most kind and beneficent, and their\r\nneighbours of a higher class spoke of them as a most welcome addition to\r\nthe little society of the neighbourhood. On their part the tenants were\r\ngreatly delighted with their new residence. The arrangement of the\r\nhouse, which would have been a trial to many, was not so to them. In\r\nevery respect Croglin Grange was exactly suited to them.\r\n\r\n“The winter was spent most happily by the new inmates of Croglin Grange,\r\nwho shared in all the little social pleasures of the district, and made\r\nthemselves very popular. In the following summer, there was one day\r\nwhich was dreadfully, annihilatingly hot. The brothers lay under the\r\ntrees with their books, for it was too hot for any active occupation.\r\nThe sister sat in the verandah and worked, or tried to work, for, in the\r\nintense sultriness of that summer day, work was next to impossible. They\r\ndined early, and after dinner they still sat out in the verandah,\r\nenjoying the cool air which came with evening, and they watched the sun\r\nset, and the moon rise over the belt of trees which separated the\r\ngrounds from the churchyard, seeing it mount the heavens till the whole\r\nlawn was bathed in silver light, across which the long shadows from the\r\nshrubbery fell as if embossed, so vivid and distinct were they.\r\n\r\n“When they separated for the night, all retiring to their rooms on the\r\nground-floor (for, as I said, there was no upstairs in that house), the\r\nsister felt that the heat was still so great that she could not sleep,\r\nand having fastened her window, she did not close the shutters--in that\r\nvery quiet place it was not necessary--and, propped against the pillows,\r\nshe still watched the wonderful, the marvellous beauty of that summer\r\nnight. Gradually she became aware of two lights, two lights which\r\nflickered in and out in the belt of trees which separated the lawn from\r\nthe churchyard, and as her gaze became fixed upon them, she saw them\r\nemerge, fixed in a dark substance, a definite ghastly _something_, which\r\nseemed every moment to become nearer, increasing in size and substance\r\nas it approached. Every now and then it was lost for a moment in the\r\nlong shadows which stretched across the lawn from the trees, and then it\r\nemerged larger than ever, and still coming on--on. As she watched it,\r\nthe most uncontrollable horror seized her. She longed to get away, but\r\nthe door was close to the window and the door was locked on the inside,\r\nand while she was unlocking it, she must be for an instant nearer to\r\n_it_. She longed to scream, but her voice seemed paralysed, her tongue\r\nglued to the roof of her mouth.\r\n\r\n“Suddenly, she never could explain why afterwards, the terrible object\r\nseemed to turn to one side, seemed to be going round the house, not to\r\nbe coming to her at all, and immediately she jumped out of bed and\r\nrushed to the door, but as she was unlocking it, she heard scratch,\r\nscratch, scratch upon the window, and saw a hideous brown face with\r\nflaming eyes glaring in at her. She rushed back to the bed, but the\r\ncreature continued to scratch, scratch, scratch upon the window. She\r\nfelt a sort of mental comfort in the knowledge that the window was\r\nsecurely fastened on the inside. Suddenly the scratching sound ceased,\r\nand a kind of pecking sound took its place. Then, in her agony, she\r\nbecame aware that the creature was unpicking the lead! The noise\r\ncontinued, and a diamond pane of glass fell into the room. Then a long\r\nbony finger of the creature came in and turned the handle of the window,\r\nand the window opened, and the creature came in; and it came across the\r\nroom, and her terror was so great that she could not scream, and it came\r\nup to the bed, and it twisted its long, bony fingers into her hair, and\r\nit dragged her head over the side of the bed, and--it bit her violently\r\nin the throat.\r\n\r\n“As it bit her, her voice was released, and she screamed with all her\r\nmight and main. Her brothers rushed out of their rooms, but the door was\r\nlocked on the inside. A moment was lost while they got a poker and broke\r\nit open. Then the creature had already escaped through the window, and\r\nthe sister, bleeding violently from a wound in the throat, was lying\r\nunconscious over the side of the bed. One brother pursued the creature,\r\nwhich fled before him through the moonlight with gigantic strides, and\r\neventually seemed to disappear over the wall into the churchyard. Then\r\nhe rejoined his brother by the sister’s bedside. She was dreadfully hurt\r\nand her wound was a very definite one, but she was of strong\r\ndisposition, not given either to romance or superstition, and when she\r\ncame to herself she said, ‘What has happened is most extraordinary and I\r\nam very much hurt. It seems inexplicable, but of course there is an\r\nexplanation, and we must wait for it. It will turn out that a lunatic\r\nhas escaped from some asylum and found his way here.’ The wound healed\r\nand she appeared to get well, but the doctor who was sent for to her\r\nwould not believe that she could bear so terrible a shock so easily, and\r\ninsisted that she must have change, mental and physical; so her\r\nbrothers took her to Switzerland.\r\n\r\n“Being a sensible girl, when she went abroad, she threw herself at once\r\ninto the interests of the country she was in. She dried plants, she made\r\nsketches, she went up mountains, and, as autumn came on, she was the\r\nperson who urged that they should return to Croglin Grange. ‘We have\r\ntaken it,’ she said, ‘for seven years, and we have only been there one;\r\nand we shall always find it difficult to let a house which is only one\r\nstory high, so we had better return there; lunatics do not escape every\r\nday.’ As she urged it, her brothers wished nothing better, and the\r\nfamily returned to Cumberland. From there being no upstairs in the\r\nhouse, it was impossible to make any great change in their arrangements.\r\nThe sister occupied the same room, but it is unnecessary to say she\r\nalways closed her shutters, which, however, as in many old houses,\r\nalways left one top pane of the window uncovered. The brothers moved,\r\nand occupied a room together exactly opposite that of their sister, and\r\nthey always kept loaded pistols in their room.\r\n\r\n“The winter passed most peacefully and happily. In the following March\r\nthe sister was suddenly awakened by a sound she remembered only too\r\nwell--scratch, scratch, scratch upon the window, and looking up, she\r\nsaw, climbed up to the topmost pane of the window, the same hideous\r\nbrown shrivelled face, with glaring eyes, looking in at her. This time\r\nshe screamed as loud as she could. Her brothers rushed out of their room\r\nwith pistols, and out of the front door. The creature was already\r\nscudding away across the lawn. One of the brothers fired and hit it in\r\nthe leg, but still with the other leg it continued to make way,\r\nscrambled over the wall into the churchyard, and seemed to disappear\r\ninto a vault which belonged to a family long extinct.\r\n\r\n“The next day the brothers summoned all the tenants of Croglin Grange,\r\nand in their presence the vault was opened. A horrible scene revealed\r\nitself. The vault was full of coffins; they had been broken open, and\r\ntheir contents, horribly mangled and distorted, were scattered over the\r\nfloor. One coffin alone remained intact. Of that the lid had been\r\nlifted, but still lay loose upon the coffin. They raised it, and there,\r\nbrown, withered, shrivelled, mummified, but quite entire, was the same\r\nhideous figure which had looked in at the windows of Croglin Grange,\r\nwith the marks of a recent pistol-shot in the leg; and they did--the\r\nonly thing that can lay a vampire--they burnt it.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Highcliffe, June 30, 1874._--It is delightful to be here again.

I believe it is owing\r\nto her conversion to Lady Jane Ellice’s teetotalism; but she says it is\r\nnot that. Lady Jane herself is a perpetual sunshine, which radiates on\r\nall around her and is quite enchanting. Miss Lindsay is the only other\r\nguest. In the evening Lady Jane sings and Miss Lindsay recites--most\r\nwonderfully--out of Shakspeare, with great power and pathos.\r\n\r\n“It has not been fine weather, but we have had delightful walks on the\r\nsand, by the still sad-looking sea, with the Isle of Wight and its\r\nNeedles rising in the faint distance, or in the thick woods of\r\nwind-blown ilex and arbutus. One day we went to ‘the Haven House,’ which\r\nis a place that often comes back to my recollection--picturesquely,\r\ngauntly standing on a tongue of land at the meeting of river and bay, at\r\nthe end of a weird pine-wood, where the gnarled roots of the trees all\r\nwrithe seawards out of the sand. Here groups of children were at play on\r\nthe little jetties of sea-weedy stones and timber, while a row of herons\r\nwere catching fish--solitarily--at great intervals, in the bay.\r\n\r\n“Lady Mary Lambart came last night--a simple, self-composed girl, with a\r\npale face and golden hair.

Outside, the position\r\nis beautiful, on a little height above the river, near which are some\r\nold ruins, and which winds away to the sea through flat reedy\r\nmeadow-lands, still marked by sails of boats where its outline is lost\r\nin distance.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 30._--Mrs. Hamilton Hamilton came last night. She was a daughter\r\nof Sir G. Robinson. Her father’s aide-de-camp, Captain Campbell, a poor\r\nman, wanted to marry her, and she was attached to him; but it was not\r\nallowed, and they were separated. She was married to Mr. Hamilton\r\nHamilton, but Captain Campbell never ceased to think of her, and he was\r\nambitious for her sake, and became Sir Colin Campbell and Lord Clyde.\r\nAfterwards, when she was free, it was thought he would marry her. He\r\nsent her an Indian shawl, and he wrote to her, and he came to see her,\r\nbut he never proposed; and she waited and expected, and at last she\r\nheard he had said, ‘No, it could not be; people would say it was\r\nabsurd.’ But it would not have been absurd at all, and she would have\r\nliked it very much.\r\n\r\n“One always feels here as if one did not half appreciate the perfection\r\nof each day as it goes by. It needs time to recognise and realise the\r\nwarmth and colour which a noble mind, a true heart, and an ever\r\nheaven-aspiring soul can throw into even the commonest things of life. I\r\noften wonder how these walks, how these rooms with their old boisserie\r\nwould appear with another inhabitant; quite unimpressive perhaps--but\r\nnow they are simply illuminated. Beautiful pictures remain with one from\r\neverything at Highcliffe, but most of all that of the noble figure,\r\nseated in her high tapestried chair, painting at her little table by the\r\nlight of the green lamp, and behind her a great vase filled with\r\ncolossal branches of green chestnut, mingled with tall white lilies,\r\nsuch as Gabriel bore before the Virgin. As Lady Jane sings, she is\r\nroused to call for more songs, for ‘something pathetic, full of\r\npassion--love cannot be passionate enough.’--‘What! another?’ says Lady\r\nJane. ‘Another, two nothers, three nothers: I cannot have enough.’\r\n\r\n“‘In the perfect Christian, the principal virtues which produce an\r\nupright life and beauty of form are fervent faith and the love of our\r\ncrucified Redeemer. As faith and love deepen, so external grace and\r\nbeauty increase, until they become able to convert the hearts of men....\r\nThe soul that is beloved of God becomes beautiful in proportion as it\r\nreceives more of the Divine grace.’ These words are from Savonarola’s\r\nSermons, and do they not apply to our Lady?\r\n\r\n“Lady Caroline Charteris[103] came to luncheon--plain in features, but\r\nin mind indescribably beautiful and interesting. She brought with her a\r\nmost touching letter she had received from Dr. Brown[104] after his\r\nwife’s death. He spoke of the wells of salvation which men came to when\r\nthey were truly thirsty, otherwise most people either passed them\r\naltogether, or stayed an instant, gazed into them admiringly, and still\r\npassed on. With Lady Caroline came Mrs. David Ricardo in a beautiful\r\npink hat, like a Gainsborough in flesh and blood.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 1._--A delightful morning in the library, fitful sunlight\r\ngleaming through the stained windows and upon the orange datura flowers\r\nin the conservatory, Lady Waterford painting at her table, Lady Jane and\r\nMiss Lindsay and Lady Mary Lambart[105] (a noble-looking girl like a\r\npicture by Bronzino) working around. Lady Waterford talked of the odd\r\nmistakes of words--how an old lady always said ‘facetious’ for\r\n‘officious’--that when she came by the railway the porters had been so\r\nvery ‘facetious,’ &c. Miss Mary Boyle condoled with an old woman at the\r\nAshridge almshouses on the loss of her old husband. ‘Oh, yes, ma’am,\r\nit’s a great loss; but still, ma’am, I’m quite happy, for I know that\r\nhe’s gone to Beelzebub’s bosom.’--‘I think you must mean\r\nAbraham.’--‘Well, yes, ma’am, since you mention it, I think that _was_\r\nthe gentleman’s name.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LIBRARY, HIGHCLIFFE.][106]\r\n\r\n“In the afternoon we had a delightful walk to Hoborne, across a common\r\non which a very rare kind of ophrys grows. Lady Waterford talked of a\r\nvisit she had had at Ford from Mr. Wayte, the new Rector of Norham, who\r\ntold her that a few nights before, his curate, Mr. Simon, had been\r\nobliged to go to fetch some papers out of the vestry at night. When he\r\nopened the church door, the moonlight was streaming in at the west\r\nwindow, and the middle of the nave was in bright light, but the side\r\naisles were dark. He walked briskly down the middle of the church to the\r\nvestry, and, as he went, was aware that a figure dressed in white was\r\nsitting motionless in the corner of one of the pews in the aisle. He did\r\nnot stay, but went into the vestry to get his papers, and, as he\r\nreturned, he saw that the figure was still in the same place. Much\r\nagitated, he did not go up to it, but hurried home, and waited for\r\ndaylight, when he returned at once to the church. The figure was still\r\nthere, and did not move as he approached. When he uncovered its face, he\r\nsaw that it was a dead body. The body had been found in the Tweed the\r\nday before, and the finders had not known what to do with it, so they\r\nhad wrapped it in a sheet, and set it up in the church.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 3._--We drove to Ashley Clinton--a charming place. Lady Waterford\r\ntalked of the origin of words--of weeds as applied to dress. Mrs.\r\nHamilton said how the Queen of the Sandwich Islands always spoke of\r\nflowers as weeds. ‘What pretty weeds there are in the cottage gardens.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FOUNTAIN, HIGHCLIFFE.][107]\r\n\r\n“Lady Waterford spoke of the picture of Miss Jane Warburton near her\r\nbedroom door; how she was appointed maid of honour to Queen Caroline at\r\na time when maids of honour were rather fast, and how, at dinner, when\r\nthe maids proposed toasts, and one gave the Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nanother the Dean of St. Paul’s, or some other old man, she alone had the\r\ncourage to give the smartest and handsomest man of the day, the Duke of\r\nArgyll.[108] She was so laughed at by her companions that it made her\r\ncry, and at the drawing-room somebody said to the Duke of Argyll, ‘That\r\nis a young lady who has been crying for you,’ and told him the story. He\r\nwas much touched, but unfortunately he was married. Afterwards, however,\r\nwhen his Duchess died, he married Miss Warburton, and, though she was\r\nvery ugly, he thought her absolute perfection. In the midst of the most\r\ninteresting conversation he would break off to ‘listen to his Jane;’ and\r\nhe had the most absolute faith in her, till once he discovered that she\r\nhad deceived him in something about a marriage for one of her daughters\r\nwith an Earl of Dalkeith, which was not quite straightforward; and it\r\nbroke his heart, and he died.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 5._--I came up to London with Lady Waterford on Friday, and as\r\nusual I find what Carlyle calls ‘the immeasurable, soul-confusing uproar\r\nof a London life’ rather delightful than otherwise. To-day I have been\r\nwith Mary Lefevre to Marylebone, to hear Mr. Haweis[109] preach. He is\r\nlike a Dominican preacher in Italy, begins without a text, acts,\r\ncrouches, springs, walks about in the pulpit--which is fortunately large\r\nenough, and every now and then spreads out vast black wings like a bat,\r\nand looks as if he was about to descend upon his appalled congregation.\r\nPart of his sermon was very solemn, but in part preacher and audience\r\nalike giggled. ‘He was converted last Sunday week: he was converted\r\nexactly at half-past four P.M., but since then they say that he has been\r\nseen at a theatre, at a ball, and at a racecourse, and that therefore\r\nhis conversion is doubtful. Now you know my opinion is that none of\r\nthese things are wrong in themselves. The question is not what the\r\nplaces are, but with what purpose and in what spirit people go to them.\r\nOur Saviour would not have thought it wrong to go to any of these\r\nplaces. John the Baptist certainly acted altogether on a lower level and\r\nwent out as an ascetic into the wilderness. But our Saviour was both\r\ncharitable and large-hearted. When _He_ was asked to a feast, he went.\r\nHe never sacrificed Himself unnecessarily, and so the ‘religious people’\r\nof that day abused him for eating with publicans and sinners. It is just\r\nwhat ‘religious people,’ the Pharisees of our own day, say now.... Oh,\r\nlet us leave these perpetual judgments of others.’\r\n\r\n“I went afterwards to luncheon at Lady Castletown’s; she was not come in\r\nfrom church, but I went up into the drawing-room. A good-looking very\r\nsmart young lady was sitting there, with her back to the window,\r\nevidently waiting also. After a pause, I made some stupid remark to her\r\nabout heat or cold, &c. She looked at me, and said, ‘That is a very\r\ncommonplace remark. I’ll make a remark. If a woman does not marry, she\r\nis nobody at all, nothing at all in the world; but if a man ever marries\r\nat all, he is an absolute fool.’ I said, ‘I know who you are; no one but\r\nMiss Rhoda Broughton would have said that.’ And it was she.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Browning came and sat on the other side of her at luncheon. She\r\nsaid something of novels without love: I said something of black dose as\r\na cure for love. Mr. Browning said that Aristophanes spoke of ‘the\r\nblack-dose-loving Egyptians.’ Miss Broughton said, ‘How do you know the\r\nword means black dose?’--‘Because there is a similar passage in\r\nHerodotus which throws light upon the subject, with details on which it\r\nwould not be delicate to dwell.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 6._--Dined with Madame du Quaire, meeting Mr. and Mrs. Wigan and\r\nMr. and Mrs. Preston. Mrs. Wigan talked of children’s odd sayings: of\r\none who, being told that God could see everywhere, asked if He could see\r\nthe top of His own head; of another, at a school-feast, who being asked\r\nto have another bun, said, ‘Oh no, want to go home.’--‘Nonsense! have\r\nanother bun.’--‘No, want to go home;’ upon which the giver of the feast\r\ntook him up, and the child exclaimed, ‘Oh don’t, don’t _bend_ me.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 8._--A drawing-party at Lambeth. Madeleine Lefevre and I went\r\nafterwards to show our drawings to Mrs. Tait, and had luncheon in the\r\nlarge cool pleasant rooms. In the afternoon I went with the Lefevres to\r\nthe camp at Wimbledon. It is an immense enclosure, with streets of\r\ntents, lines of flags. In front of the officers’ tents are masses of\r\nflowers in pots sunk in a substratum of tan, as by law the turf may not\r\nbe broken. Lady Ducie’s tent, whither we went, was most luxurious. We\r\nwent on afterwards to Lady Leven’s garden, which was a beautiful sight,\r\nwith brilliant groups of people. At the end, children were watching the\r\nmanœuvres of some cats, who sat quiet with garlands of mice and birds\r\nupon their heads.”\r\n\r\n“_July 10._--Drew in the Tower of London, and dined at Lord Castletown’s\r\nto meet Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey Pearse (she Mario’s daughter), Madame du\r\nQuaire, and the truly extraordinary M. Vivier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATEWAY, LAMBETH PALACE.][110]\r\n\r\n“He talked incessantly, but expected what Lady Castletown called ‘a\r\ngallery,’ and perfect silence and attention. ‘Je suis intéressant, moi!\r\nLa petite de C. elle n’a rien: elle chante, elle fait les oiseaux, voilà\r\ntout. Pour entendre les oiseaux, vous ferez mieux d’aller dans vos\r\nsquares: vous les entendrez, et vous payerez rien. Mais la petite de C.\r\nelle est moralement malsaine: moi je ne le suis pas, et je\r\nsuis--intéressant.’\r\n\r\n“He was so surprised at the number of servants: ‘And does all _that_\r\nsleep in the house?’ he said.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BLOODY GATE, TOWER OF LONDON.][111]\r\n\r\n“In the evening he sang ‘Nellie,’ and his ‘Drame’--of a blind Spanish\r\nmusician with a violin, watching windows for money, a perfect passion of\r\navarice and expectation.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 11._--Luncheon with Lady Morley, meeting Miss Flora Macdonald,\r\nwho has still a reminiscence of the great beauty which brought such a\r\nsurprise to the old Duchess of Gloucester when she asked Victor Emmanuel\r\nwhat he admired most in England, and he answered so promptly, ‘Miss\r\nFlora Macdonald.’ Lady Katherine Parker described--‘because, alas! it\r\nwas discovered that we date just a little farther back than the\r\nLeicesters,’ having to sit near ----, the most airified man in London.\r\nShe was congratulated afterwards upon his having condescended to speak\r\nto her, but said he wouldn’t, only his neighbour on the other side was\r\neven more insignificant than herself, and to her he did not speak at\r\nall. He said, apropos of a dinner at Dorchester House, ‘Pray who _are_\r\nthese Holfords?’--‘Oh,’ said Lady Katherine, ‘I believe they are people\r\nwho have got a little shake-down somewhere in Park Lane.’\r\n\r\n“I was at the ‘shake-down’ in the evening--something quite beautiful.\r\nThe staircase is that of an old Genoese palace, and was one blaze of\r\ncolour, and the broad landings behind the alabaster balustrades were\r\nfilled with people, sitting or leaning over, as in old Venetian\r\npictures. The dress of the time entirely lends itself to these effects.\r\nI sat in one of the arcades with Lady Sarah Lindsay and her daughters,\r\nthen with Lady Carnarvon. We watched the amusing contrasts of the people\r\ncoming upstairs--the shrinking of some, the _dégagée_ manner of others,\r\nthe dignity of a very few--in this, no one to be compared with Princess\r\nMary. The Prince and Princess of Wales were close by (he very merry,\r\ntalking with much action, like a foreigner), also the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Prussia. Lady Somers looked glorious in a black dress\r\nthickly sprinkled with green beetles’ wings and a head-dress of the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n“With Lady Carnarvon I had a long talk, and could not help feeling how\r\ntruly one might apply to her Edgar Poe’s lines:--\r\n\r\n    “Thou would’st be loved, oh! then thy heart\r\n       From its present pathway part not:\r\n     Being everything that now thou art,\r\n       Be nothing that thou art not.\r\n     So, with the world, thy winning ways,\r\n       Thy grace, thy more than beauty,\r\n     Shall be the theme of endless praise,\r\n       And love, and simple duty.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 12._--Yesterday there was a great party at Hatfield. I drove with\r\nthe Woods to King’s Cross for the special train at 4 P.M., but was\r\nseparated from them at the station, and joined Lady Darnley and Raglan\r\nSomerset. A tremendous storm was brewing over London, but we left it\r\nbehind at first. Quantities of carriages from the house were in waiting\r\nat the Hatfield station. The street was lined with wreaths and flowers,\r\nand a succession of triumphal arches made the steep hill look like a\r\nlong flowery bower. In the park, the grand old limes were in full\r\nblossom in front of the stately brick house. On the terrace on the other\r\nside the mass of guests was assembling. I went off with Lady Braybrooke\r\nto the labyrinth, then with Lady Darnley and the E. de Bunsens over the\r\nhouse. The storm now broke with tremendous lightning and loud peals of\r\nthunder, and in the Golden Gallery it was almost dark. Just as it began,\r\nthe royal party drove up, the Prince and Princess of Wales, Prince and\r\nPrincess of Prussia, Prince Arthur, the Tecks, the Duchess of\r\nManchester, and a great quantity of suite--a very pretty procession,\r\nvehemently cheered by the people. When the storm cleared, we went out\r\nupon the terraces; the royal party went to the labyrinth. As it\r\nreturned, I was standing with the Leghs of Lyme at the head of the\r\nsteps, when Prince Arthur came up to me, was very cordial, and talked\r\nfor some time about Rome, &c. I asked him if the Queen drew still. ‘Oh,\r\nyes,’ he said, ‘she is quite devoted to it: and I am very fond of it\r\ntoo, but then _I_ have so little time.’\r\n\r\n“Owing to the rain, the dinner for eight hundred had to be moved into\r\nthe Armoury. The royal guests and a few others dined in the Marble Hall;\r\nthe Princess of Prussia was forgotten as they were going in, and had to\r\nbe hunted for. We all dined at little tables; I was at one with Mrs.\r\nStuart Wortley, Mrs. W. Lowther, and Lord Sydney. Afterwards the\r\nterraces and house were beautifully illuminated with coloured lights, in\r\nwhich, through what looked like a sea of fire and blood, the cascades of\r\nwhite roses frothed up. Every one walked out. The royalties seemed to\r\nspring up everywhere; one was always running against them by mistake.\r\nThere was a pretty procession as they went away, and immediately\r\nafterwards I returned with Miss Thackeray, her sister, and the Master of\r\nNapier.\r\n\r\n“An excursion of this kind from London is delightful. _C’est\r\nl’entr’acte!_”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPIÈGNE.][112]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 13._--Yesterday (Sunday) I had luncheon with Lady Castletown;\r\nyoung Mr. Astley was there, and Miss Trollope. Lady Castletown talked\r\nof Vivier, of the marvellous versatility of his genius, of his absolute\r\nrefusal to go any way but his own; that except for love he never sang a\r\nsingle song under three thousand francs; that when he gave a concert at\r\nNice he asked ‘cent francs chaque,’ and the rooms were crowded; that at\r\nCompiègne he did some things, but he only allowed three persons to be\r\npresent--the Emperor and two others. He excluded the Empress, because,\r\nin his Spanish scene, she had dared, Spanish-wise, to throw a bracelet\r\ninto his hat, which so offended him that he told the Emperor he should\r\nnever let her see him again. The Emperor quite delighted in him, and\r\ncould not bear him to go away. He persuaded Vivier to go with him to\r\nVichy, and there some of the great men of the court called to him from a\r\nwindow, as he was walking in the garden, and begged him to come to them.\r\nHe was furious, and complained to the Emperor. ‘Sire, ce n’est pas comme\r\ncela qu’il faut appeler Vivier.’ On one occasion he stopped and threw up\r\nhis whole comedy in the middle before a large audience because Lord\r\nHoughton sneezed. It was therefore necessary carefully to select his\r\naudience, otherwise he might take offence and never return. He has\r\ndiscovered powers in a French horn which no one had any idea of before,\r\nand he can sit close by you and play it with a degree of delicacy which\r\nperfectly transports you--the most sublime philosophy of music.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOLLAND HOUSE.][114]\r\n\r\n“We went afterwards to Holland House. I sat in the carriage at first\r\nunder the shadow of the grand old red pile, but Lady Holland sent Mr.\r\nHayward out to fetch me in, which he did with a bad grace.[113] Lady\r\nHolland is a very little woman, simply dressed, with a white cap. She\r\nhas sparkling eyes, which give her face a wonderful animation; which is\r\nalmost beauty in itself, and which, in the setting of that house and its\r\nhistoric memories, makes her quite a person to remember. Mrs. Locke was\r\nthere, and Lord Tankerville, whom I was very glad to see again.\r\nOutside, on a comfortable bench, we sat some time with the old Duc de\r\nRichelieu. Mrs. Wingfield and I wandered about in the gardens, which\r\nwere glorious!--such blazes of flowers between the trees, such splashing\r\nfountains, such armies of scarlet lilies looking over the clipped yew\r\nhedges; and the house itself so rich in colour and in shadow. Then there\r\nis a glade--a grass walk of immense length, completely shut in by trees\r\nand forest-like tangle, so that you might think yourself in the deep\r\nrecesses of Sherwood instead of close to London.\r\n\r\n“Everard Primrose called to us out of a window, and we went up to him in\r\nthe old library. He was in a melancholy mood, and would not come down\r\nwith us; but Mrs. Wingfield went back to him alone, and, with that\r\nwonderful sympathy which is natural to her, she soon tamed him, and he\r\ncame to us and was as pleasant as possible.\r\n\r\n“The picture of Marie, Princess Lichtenstein, hung, pale and sad,\r\nlooking down on us from a corner, and seemed to say, ‘Hence I am now\r\nbanished; even my portrait is put away.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 14._--Dined at Lady Carnarvon’s to meet Lord Stanhope. Only the\r\ntwo mothers of the house, Lady Chesterfield and Lady Carnarvon--a\r\ncharming good-humoured old lady, and a Mr. Townshend were there. Lord\r\nCarnarvon talked much of the interests of regular work and the\r\nunutterable weariness of interruptions. Lord Stanhope was very agreeable\r\nat dinner, but fell asleep afterwards. The younger Lady Carnarvon, with\r\nher hair sprinkled with diamonds, looked unspeakably lovely.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOLMHURST, THE ROCK WALK.]\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, July 19, 1874._--I know half my friends wonder how I can\r\nlike the change from the intellectual interests and luxurious life of\r\nLondon to the society of the bumble-bees and butterflies in this little\r\nhermitage; but I am sure the absolute quietude is very good for one, and\r\nI rush into my work at once, and get through no end of it. I came away\r\nfrom London, however, rather pining to stay for the party at Holland\r\nHouse, because I thought it was a duty to Lea and Miss Leycester, and I\r\nexperienced the bathos, which so often comes when one is rather\r\nconceited about a little piece of self-sacrifice, of finding they would\r\nboth much rather I had gone to the party, that they might have heard all\r\nabout it!\r\n\r\n“Miss Leycester is very cheerful, and greatly enjoys her summer retreat\r\nhere--sitting out amid the scent of the lime-flowers: being wheeled\r\nabout in her chair amongst the baskets of geraniums: having tea upon the\r\nterrace, &c. Another sweet old lady cousin, Miss Tatton, who cannot walk\r\nat all, is just arriving for a fortnight, and the Hospice is quite full\r\nof dear feeble beings.\r\n\r\n“As to the little troubles about which you ask me, I can only reply in\r\nthe words of Delatouche to George Sand, ‘Patientez avec le temps et\r\nl’expérience, et soyez tranquille: ces deux tristes conseilleurs\r\nviendront assez vite.’\r\n\r\n“I shall be very anxious to hear about your German travels.... To me, if\r\none is not in a fever about going on, the lingering in the wonderful old\r\ntowns by the way, so full of a past deeply written still on their\r\nremains, is far more interesting than that part of the tour which all\r\nthe world takes, and the little glimpses of people and life which one\r\ngets in them give one far more to think about afterwards. Würtzburg and\r\nRatisbon I forbid you to pass unseen: they used to be reached, toiled\r\nafter with such labour and fatigue; and now, in these railway days, they\r\nare generally--_passed_.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n_“July 29._--I have been in London again for two days. On Tuesday Sir\r\nHoward Elphinstone, the Lefevres, and I went to Holland House, where\r\nLady Castletown and Mrs. Wingfield joined us. We drew in the Arcade, and\r\nthen Miss Coventry came out in her Spanish hat and called us in to Lady\r\nHolland. She was in the west room, sitting in the wide window, and, like\r\na queen, she sat on, moving for nobody. She was, however, very kind, and\r\npleased with our drawings. She talked of the royal ball, and said that\r\nthe two little Princes were so delighted with Puss in Boots that they\r\npulled his tail incessantly, till at last Puss said, ‘Remember I have\r\ngot teeth and claws as well as a tail,’ and then they were frightened\r\nand left off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOLLAND HOUSE (GENERAL VIEW).][115]\r\n\r\n“Wednesday was Victoria Liddell’s wedding-day.[116] All Fulham turned\r\nout, and Walham Green was a succession of triumphal arches, garlands,\r\nand mottoes. I went with Victor Williamson, and they mistook us for the\r\nbridegroom and best man. They told us to go up and wait near the altar,\r\nand the Wedding March struck up, but stopped abruptly as we went into a\r\npew.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 30._--Yesterday I dined at Lord Castletown’s, and met, as usual,\r\nan interesting party. Lord Castletown[117] talked of his youth at\r\nHolland House, when he was brought up there as the ward of Lord Holland.\r\n‘Lord H. was most indulgent, and was always finding amusements for me.\r\nOne day, two days before the end of the Eton holidays, he asked me to go\r\nsomewhere. “No, sir,” I said, “I cannot do that, because I have got my\r\nholiday task to finish.”--“And what is your task?” said Lord Holland.\r\n“Latin verses on St. Paul preaching at Athens, seventy lines.”--” Oh,\r\nwhat a grand subject,” said Lord Holland; “leave it for me. I will do\r\nyour task for you, and do you go out and amuse yourself.” And he did it\r\nall but four lines, and then some important business called him away,\r\nand he gave them back to me, saying I must finish them as well as I\r\ncould. It was a most grand set of verses, and when I gave them up to\r\nKeats, he would read them aloud before the whole school. In the middle\r\nhe said, “Who wrote these, sir?”--“I, sir.”--“You lie, sir,” said Keats.\r\nAt last he came to the last four lines. “You wrote these, sir,” he said.\r\nI heard no more of it, but I never got back my copy of verses.\r\n\r\n“‘Once I escaped from Eton, and Lord Holland caught me--found me in the\r\nstreets of London. He made me get into his carriage at once, and told\r\nthe man to drive to the White Horse Cellar, whence the coach started for\r\nEton. Unfortunately for me, there was one starting at once, and he made\r\nme get in. I remonstrated, saying that I had not got my things. “They\r\nshall be sent after you,” he said. “But I shall be flogged,\r\nsir.”--“Serve you right, too; I hope you will be flogged,” he said. I\r\nlooked very piteous, and as I got into the coach he said, “Well,\r\ngood-bye, John; I hope you’ll be flogged,” and he shook hands with me,\r\nand in my hand I found a five-pound note. He was always doing those kind\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n“‘At Holland House I saw everybody most worth seeing in Europe. All that\r\nwas best flowed in to Lord Holland, and he was equally hospitable to\r\nall. The Whigs, not only of England, but of all the world, came to him.’\r\n\r\n“Lady Castletown told a story of a Russian Princess who had a very\r\nhideous maid. One morning her maid came to her looking very much\r\nagitated--perfectly _défaite_. The Princess asked her what was the\r\nmatter, when she said, ‘Oh, I have had the most extraordinary night. As\r\nI was going to bed, I saw a man’s foot under the bed. I was going to\r\nring the bell when he stopped me by saying, “Oh, don’t ring; I have been\r\nbrought into this predicament by my hopeless passion for you. I felt\r\nthat there was no other chance of seeing you, so I ran this risk.”\r\nSeeing that he was serious, and never having had a proposal before, I\r\ncould not but talk to him; and we talked all night, and now it is all\r\nsettled, and we are to be married.’--‘Well,’ said the Princess, ‘that is\r\nvery strange; and now I am going to court, so where are my\r\ndiamonds?’--‘Oh, of course where they always are,’ said the maid; but,\r\nwhen she looked, they were gone: the lover had taken them. ‘Of course\r\nthat is what he came for,’ said the Princess; ‘do you think he would\r\nhave come for _you_?’ And the diamonds were never recovered.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOLLAND HOUSE (THE LILY GARDEN).][118]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 8._--Came to Chevening. The house strikes one by its\r\noverwhelming impression of sadness. The sunshine is all blotted out\r\nsince last year by the death of its beloved mistress last winter;[119]\r\nbut I am glad I came, as it gives pleasure, and I am glad I was asked so\r\nsoon, as it shows their liking to have me. Walking with Lady Mahon[120]\r\nbetween the same beds of tall flowers amongst which I walked with Lady\r\nStanhope last year, she spoke of her very touchingly, how, though there\r\nmight be many pleasures and interests left in life, there was always the\r\nfeeling that there never could be what _had_ been--the warm interest in\r\nothers, the cheerful sunny nature which radiated on all it came in\r\ncontact with. The illness was very sudden, and little alarm felt till\r\njust the end. Her last words to her poor broken-hearted husband were,\r\n‘Do not fret, love; I shall soon be quite well now.’ Lady Mahon said\r\nthat Lord Stanhope’s heroic determination to bear up for all their sakes\r\nenabled them to follow his example.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 10, Sunday._--This afternoon I drove with Lord Stanhope in the\r\nlong grassy glades of the park, the highest and prettiest of which gave\r\na name to the place--Chevening, ‘the Nook in the Hill.’ We drove\r\nafterwards from one fine young Wellingtonia which he had planted to\r\nanother, examining them all, and came back by the Spottiswoodes’. It is\r\na fine old place, intended as an imitation of the Villa Doria at Rome,\r\nand though in nowise like Villa Doria, it has a look of Italy in its\r\ngroves of ilexes and its cypresses. Lady Frederick Campbell[121] lived\r\nhere. Her first husband was the Lord Ferrers who was hanged, and some\r\nevidence which she gave was instrumental in bringing about his\r\ncondemnation. Lord Ferrers cursed her, saying that her death would be\r\neven more painful than his; and so in fact it was, for in 1807 she was\r\nburnt in one of the towers of the house, from spontaneous combustion it\r\nis said. Nothing was found of her but her thumb, she was so completely\r\nconsumed, and ever since it is said that the ghost of Lady Frederick\r\nCampbell wanders in the grounds at night, brandishing her thumbless\r\nhand, and looking for her lost thumb. The place lends itself to this\r\nfrom its wonderful green glades lined with cedars and guarded by huge\r\ngrey stone vases.\r\n\r\n“Coomb Bank was afterwards bought by the Claytons, who spent all they\r\nhad in the purchase and had nothing left for keeping it up, so\r\neventually they sold it to Mr. Spottiswoode, the King’s Printer, to whom\r\nthe monopoly of printing Bibles and Prayer-books has been the source of\r\na large fortune. Mr. Spottiswoode himself is a most remarkable man, who,\r\nfor hours before his daily walk to the City, is occupied with the\r\nhighest mathematical speculations, and returns to spend his evenings in\r\nstudies of the most abstract nature. It is said that the present\r\ngeneration is more indebted to him than to any other person for its\r\nimproved powers of analysis. He has made no important discoveries yet,\r\nbut he probably will make them, if he lives long enough. His character\r\nseems to be a wonderful combination of profound knowledge and power and\r\nprofound humility.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 11._--A semi-wet day, spent chiefly in the library, which is\r\nattached to the house by a corridor full of portraits. In the afternoon,\r\nthough it poured, we had a long drive on the Chart. The Spottiswoodes\r\ndined, and Mrs. Spottiswoode sang very old music.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 12._--Came to Cobham. It has a beautiful approach across the\r\nbroken ground of a very wild park with grand old trees. In the hollow is\r\nthe old house, which is immense, of red brick with projecting oriels and\r\ntowers. Lady Darnley[122] received me in the library; she has an\r\nunintentionally haughty manner, but when you are accustomed to her, you\r\nfind that she is charming--\r\n\r\n                  ‘Si sta placido e cheto,\r\n    Ma serba dell’ altiero nel mansueto;’[123]\r\n\r\nand soon it seemed as if one had known her all one’s life. The children\r\ncame dropping in--two grown-up daughters, two little girls, Lord\r\nClifton, and two fine frank younger boys--Ivo and Arthur. There are many\r\nguests.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 13._--A most pleasant morning sitting with Lady Darnley under\r\nthe fine old trees drawing the house, and seeing the rooms and the\r\npictures, which are mostly dull--chiefly nymphs and satyrs with very few\r\nclothes on--two very fine Titians being the redeeming part of the\r\ngallery. The pictures are wisely devoted to the public; they are too\r\nuncomfortable to live with, and the Chatham people adore them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COBHAM HALL.]\r\n\r\n“I find this house, where no one is too clever, but every one is\r\npleasant nevertheless, a great rest after Chevening, where I always felt\r\nstruggling up to an intellectual level which I have no right to and\r\nwhich I cannot attain. Apropos, the last morning Lord Stanhope talked\r\nmuch of the origin of words, and said ‘Beldam’ came from ‘Belle dame’\r\nused satirically.”\r\n\r\n“_August 15._--Returned to Holmhurst. Mr. Thomas, the landscape\r\ngardener, travelled with me. He spoke of an obnoxious American coming\r\ninto a great hotel at Liverpool and boasting of how much finer American\r\nhotels were--‘a hundred times the size,’ &c. The man he addressed\r\nlistened quietly and then said, ‘But you have not yet seen our great\r\nhotel at Southampton, sir; it is a mile long, will accommodate 5000\r\npeople, and all the waiters wait on horseback.’--‘I guess that’s a lie,\r\nsir,’ said the American. ‘Yes, it is,’ replied the Englishman, ‘but then\r\nI thought you were telling lies.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sept. 28._--A very pleasant visit of two days to the Shaw-Lefevres.\r\nThey are certainly one of the happiest and most united of families. We\r\nmade a delightful excursion of sixteen miles to Sutton Court, where they\r\nlived formerly. It must be very seldom that, after a lapse of ten years,\r\na father and mother can return to such a place in old age with their\r\nfamily of the original seven unbroken, only many others added. Sutton,\r\nthe beautiful old house of the Westons, inlaid with terra-cotta, is just\r\nthe place for a story, with the closed wing where the ivy forces its way\r\nthrough the walls and wreaths round the frames of the old family\r\nportraits, which, rent and forlorn, flap in the gusts of wind whenever a\r\ndistant door opens. Then there is the still-used Roman Catholic chapel,\r\nwith its priest and its country congregation.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Powderham Castle, Oct. 4._--A week here has been most delightful. I\r\nhad not felt certain how much I might like it, how much my dear friend\r\nof old days might be changed by lapse of time and new relations. I can\r\nonly say that, if he is changed, it is in being more entirely and\r\nperfectly delightful than ever, more indescribably thoughtful for\r\nothers, more filled with plans for the good of every one, and withal so\r\nsimple, so free from cant, that all else seems unchristian and mundane\r\nby comparison. Lady Agnes is the one person I have seen who is quite\r\nentirely worthy of him, and it does seem as if a reward of such\r\nperfectly beautiful lives was given even in this life, that they should\r\nhave been thrown together.\r\n\r\n“I arrived about half-past five. Powderham has a low park, rising into\r\nhigh ground as it approaches the castle, which has a gateway and\r\ncourtyard. Here Charlie was walking about amongst orange-trees in large\r\nboxes like those at the Tuileries. The bedrooms are dilapidated and\r\nfalling into decay: Lord Devon will not restore them, nor will he set\r\nany of his estates free by selling the rest, but he goes on planting\r\nquantities of Wellingtonias in his park and making expensive fences\r\nround them. In himself he is charming, with a perfect and entirely\r\ncourteous manner. Colonel and Mrs. Heygarth have been here, he still\r\nlame with shot in the leg from the battle of the Alma, where he was\r\nwounded again while lying on the ground, having been noticed because he\r\ntried to save Lord Chewton, who was lying near him, and whom a Russian\r\nsoldier was about to murder.\r\n\r\n“With Charlie and Lady Agnes I have been completely at home and\r\nperfectly happy. One day we went to the sands, and walked along them to\r\nDawlish. But yesterday was quite charming; I had much wished to go to\r\nLady Morley at Whiteway, and after luncheon we set off--Charlie, Lady\r\nAgnes, and I. When the narrow lanes grew too steep for the\r\npony-carriage, we left it under a hedge, and putting a saddle on Jack\r\nthe pony, rode and walked by turns up the hill and across the wild heath\r\nof the open moor: Charlie rode pick-a-back behind Lady Agnes. In the\r\nwoods we met Morley, greatly surprised to see us arrive thus. The others\r\nwere out, but Morley showed all the curiosities of the house, which were\r\nmany in a small way. Just as we were setting off, Lady Morley and Lady\r\nKatherine returned, and, after many pro’s and con’s, we stayed to a most\r\namusing dinner, and only set off again at 10 P.M. with lanthorns in\r\npitch darkness. Morley and Lady Katherine walked with us the first three\r\nmiles over the wild moor with _their_ lanthorn, and then we dived down\r\ninto the eerie lanes closely overhung with green and fringed with ferns,\r\nand most lovely were the effects as the lanthorn revealed one gleam of\r\nglistening foliage after another out of the darkness. When we reached\r\nhome at 11 P.M., we found the servants alarmed and a horseman sent out\r\nto search for us; and no wonder.\r\n\r\n“I was ill all night from having eaten junket at Whiteway. Charlie says\r\nthis Devonshire dainty is so called from the Neapolitan\r\n_joncetta_--cream on rushes. In Devon they pretend it is a relic of the\r\nRoman invasion!\r\n\r\n“We have just been to church at Kenton. An immense funeral party (from\r\nlast week) walked in, two and two, with great importance and occupied\r\nthree pews. They sat through the whole service, as if too overwhelmed\r\nby their late grief to rise, and the women held handkerchiefs to their\r\nfaces, and rocked, and shook the crape bows upon their bonnets, while\r\nwaiting for the expected ‘funeral discourse.’ The people here are\r\ndelightfully primitive. The other day, at a dinner Lord Devon gave, a\r\nman of the place rose to propose his health, and comprised all that\r\nneeded to be said in--‘I don’t know what Lord Devon du, but all I du\r\nknow is that if more would du as Lord Devon du du, there wouldn’t be so\r\nmany as would du as they du du.’\r\n\r\n“The wife of a neighbouring clergyman was very seriously ill of a\r\nstrange and mysterious complaint. It was observed that her worst attacks\r\nalways came on after her husband had administered the Sacrament to her.\r\nMr. O., who was attending her, studied her case very much, and came to\r\nthe conclusion that, if the peculiar symptoms she exhibited came from\r\nunnatural causes, they could only be produced by a single and very rare\r\ndrug. Forthwith he set himself to find out if there was any place in the\r\nneighbourhood where that drug was sold, and at last he did find it. He\r\nasked at the place if they had sold any of it. ‘Oh, yes; to the parson\r\nat ----; he bought some yesterday.’ As Mr. O. was going home he met the\r\nclergyman himself. He stopped him and said, ‘I have just found out that\r\nyesterday you bought some drugs at M.: now if Mrs. X. is worse\r\nto-morrow, I shall know what has caused it.’ That afternoon the\r\nclergyman went down to the shore to bathe, and he never returned. He was\r\nknown to be a splendid swimmer, and he was seen to swim far, far out to\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n“To-night Lady Agnes talked of her grandmother, who, at sixteen, was\r\nsent down to speak to the housekeeper at Audley End. The woman, who was\r\nraving mad, shut the door and said, ‘Now you must say your prayers at\r\nonce, for I have a commission from heaven to kill you.’--‘Oh, you cannot\r\ndare to do that,’ said the girl without hesitation, taking up a white\r\nnapkin which lay upon the table and giving it to her with an air of the\r\nutmost conviction, ‘for here is a reprieve.’ And the woman gave in at\r\nonce.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Anthony, Plymouth, Oct. 7._--On Monday I went to Exeter to my Aunt\r\nFitzGerald,[124] who was greatly pleased to see me. Her house is\r\ncharming, full of relics, and, as she says, certainly ‘shows that she is\r\n_somebody_.’ Over the dining-room chimney-piece hangs a magnificent\r\nMignet of the Duchess of Portsmouth. There are interesting pictures of\r\nLord Edward FitzGerald, and beautiful china given by Frederick the Great\r\nto the Duchess of York, and by her to Pamela. Most of the drawing-room\r\nfurniture is from Malmaison.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday I came here to Anthony (the Pole-Carews). It is a strange\r\ndrive from Plymouth, through endless courts, dockyards, &c., and then\r\ncrossing an arm of the sea by a ferry, which was very rough when I came,\r\nand worse at night, when the family crossed to a ball; but, as Mr. Carew\r\nsays, it is very well to have the sea between him and such a population\r\nas that of Plymouth.\r\n\r\n“This house is perfectly charming--the old hall and its pictures, the\r\noak staircase, the warm tapestried sitting-room--all, as it were,\r\ntypical of the broad christian kindness and warm-hearted cordiality of\r\nits inmates. It is a house in which no ill is ever spoken, and where\r\nscandal sits dumb; where, with the utmost merriment, there is the most\r\nsincere religious feeling, and yet an entire freedom from cant and what\r\nis called ‘religious talking.’ There is here a mutual spirit of\r\nforbearance, and an absence of all egotism and self-seeking, which is\r\nmore instructive than a thousand sermons; and it almost seems as if it\r\nwere arranged that what might be the asperities of any one member of the\r\nfamily should be softened and smoothed out by the qualities of another.\r\nMrs. Carew is the picture of a warm-hearted, most loving English mother,\r\nwho enters into and shares all the interests, all the amusements, of her\r\nchildren; and between the father and his sons there is none of the\r\nshadow which so often exists, but the truest confidence and\r\nfriendship.”[125]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 11._--It is only by a long stay that one learns all that the\r\nCarews really are--the perfect charm of this most united and beautiful\r\nfamily life. Just now their goodness has been especially drawn out by\r\nthe parting of Captain Ernest Rice and his wife in this house, he going\r\nto India for three years. The Carews especially _wished_ it to be here,\r\nthat they might soften it to both, and wonderfully have they helped\r\nthem through--cheering, enlivening, nerving, where it was possible, but\r\nnever intruding comfort when the natural burst of grief must come.\r\n\r\n“It has been very pleasant seeing the different guests come and go. The\r\nDean of St. Paul’s and Mrs. Church have been here. He is an excellent\r\nperson, but very nervous and twitchy.[126] She has a repose of goodness\r\nwhich sets you at rest with her, and imparts a confidence in her at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n“Sir John and Lady Duckworth were here for two days. His father was\r\nmilitary governor of Portsmouth. One day his mother was crossing the\r\ngreen at Mount Wyse when the sentry stopped her. ‘Do you know who you\r\nare speaking to?’ she said. ‘No, I don’t,’ he replied, ‘but I know you\r\nare not the governor’s cow, and that is the only thing which has any\r\nbusiness here.’\r\n\r\n“Lord Eliot[127] was also here. I found great grace in his sight, and\r\nwas most pressingly invited to Port Eliot. I went on Saturday. He met me\r\nat the station, and I was almost walked off my feet for four hours,\r\nbeing shown every picture in the house, every plant in the garden, and\r\nevery walk in the woods. There is a limit in what ought to be shown, and\r\nLord Eliot has never found it out.\r\n\r\n“Still Port Eliot is a beautiful place. The house and the grand old\r\nchurch of St. German’s Priory--chiefly Norman--stand close together, on\r\nshaven green lawns, radiant with masses of flowers and backed by\r\nluxuriant woods, amid which walks open here and there upon glimpses of\r\nrock and terraces near one of the salt fiords which are so common in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n“Lord St. Germans,[128] who is paralysed, is a beautiful and venerable\r\nold figure, with white hair and beard, wheeling himself about in a\r\nchair. Lord Eliot returned with me to Devonport, and introduced me to\r\nthe frightful sights of that most hideous place.\r\n\r\n“Some of the pictures at Port Eliot are beautiful, the most so that of\r\nLady Cornwallis--so simple and stately in its lines. It is engraved, but\r\nwithout the figure of a child, probably not born at that time, but\r\nintroduced afterwards in the picture.\r\n\r\n“On Friday I had a charming drive with Mrs. Carew to ‘the Hut,’ through\r\nthe narrowest lanes imaginable. An old clergyman near this, Mr. Wood,\r\nwas driving there, who told things in a most slow and solemn manner. He\r\nsaid, ‘Mrs. Wood was dreadfully frightened as we were driving, and said\r\nwe should be upset. I said, “ My dear, it is imposs”----“ible,” I could\r\nnot say, for we were over.’\r\n\r\n“Last night (Sunday) the family sang hymns beautifully in the hall. ‘No\r\nhorrid Gregorians,’ said Miss Julia, ‘for the old monks only sang those\r\nby way of penance, so why should we sing them?’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Stone Hall, Plymouth, Oct. 13._--Another pleasant family home! I came\r\non Monday to the George Edgcumbes. I had known Mrs. Edgcumbe well\r\nbefore at Rome, but had never seen her ‘dear old man,’ her ‘bird,’ &c.,\r\nas she calls her kind old husband.[129] They do not dislike having\r\nmarried their three daughters at all. It is less _embarras_ in their old\r\nage, and they enjoy having a constantly open house full of kindly\r\nhospitalities to their neighbours. Young Alwyn Greville has been here\r\ntwice since I came, and I like him increasingly. It is a charming old\r\nhouse, close to the town, but its tall trees and disordered garden give\r\nit a quaint look, which one would be sorry to see rectified. There is a\r\nview across the still reaches of the harbour, with masses of timber\r\nfloating close by and great ships lying far off, nearer the beautiful\r\nwoods of Mount Edgcumbe. Close by are many delightful walks amongst the\r\nrocks, and varied views. We went to ‘the Winter Villa,’ a luxurious\r\nsun-palace with a great conservatory, backed by natural rock. The late\r\nLord Mount Edgcumbe lived here for many years, quite helpless from\r\nrheumatic gout. It was his mother[130] who was buried alive and lived\r\nfor many years afterwards. It was known that she had been put into her\r\ncoffin with a very valuable ring upon her finger, and the sexton went in\r\nafter the funeral, when the coffin was put into the vault, to get it\r\noff. He opened the coffin, but the ring was hard to move, and he had to\r\nrub the dead finger up and down. This brought Lady Mount Edgcumbe to\r\nlife, and she sat up. The sexton fled, leaving the doors of the vault\r\nand church open. Lady Mount Edgcumbe walked home in her shroud, and\r\nappeared in front of the windows. Those within thought it was a ghost.\r\nThen she walked in at the front door. When she saw her husband, she\r\nfainted away in his arms. This gave her family time to decide what\r\nshould be done, and they settled to persuade her it had been a terrible\r\ndelirium. When she recovered from her faint, she was in her own bed, and\r\nshe ever believed it had been a dream.\r\n\r\n“On Monday we went in the Admiral’s steam-pinnace to Cotehele; Mrs.\r\nWilson, Mrs. Freemantle, and Charlie Williamson with us. I sat outside\r\nthe little cabin, and it was charming--gliding up the quiet river past\r\nthe richly wooded banks. Up steep woods we walked to Cotehele, an\r\nunaltered old house, with gate-tower, courtyard, chapel, armour-hung\r\nhall, and dark tapestried bedrooms. Within the entrance are ever-fresh\r\nstains like blood, which you can mop up with blotting paper. Sir Richard\r\nEdgcumbe went out, bidding the porter, on peril of his life, to let no\r\none in without a password. To prove his obedience, he came back himself\r\nand demanded entrance. The porter, recognising his master’s voice, let\r\nhim in, upon which Sir Richard cleft open his skull with his battle-axe\r\nas he entered. The so-called blood forms a dark pool, and looks as if it\r\nhad been spilt yesterday. Some say it is really a fungus which only\r\ngrows where blood has been shed, and that the same existed on the site\r\nof the scaffold on Tower Hill.\r\n\r\n“In the wood of Cotehele is a little chapel standing on a rock above the\r\nriver. It was built by one of the Edgcumbes in the Wars of the Roses,\r\nwho, closely pursued, vowed it if he escaped in safety. In desperation\r\nhe threw his cap and coat into the river from hence, and concealed\r\nhimself in a hollow tree: his enemies thought he was drowned.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Rockwood, Oct. 16._--I came from Plymouth here to the John Boyles’.\r\nMr. Boyle is failing rapidly, tenderly cared for by his son Edmund and\r\nhis daughter Mrs. Quin. The house is delightful and most comfortable. We\r\nhave been a charming drive by Babbicombe and Watcombe. At St. Mary\r\nChurch we saw the two great churches--Roman Catholic and High Church. In\r\nthe churchyard of the latter Bishop Phillpotts and his wife are buried\r\nunder simple crosses of grey Cornish granite. Watcombe is a curiously\r\ntumbled valley, full of grassy knolls interrupted by red rocks.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Abbots Kerswell, Oct. 26._--I have been very glad to see this\r\nplace--my cousin Marcus Hare’s home. We have been several excursions--to\r\nBerry Pomeroy, an old castle too much overgrown by woods, named from the\r\nCotentin family of Pommeraye: to Sharpham, a pretty place on the Dart\r\nwith lovely grounds: and to Darlington, a fine old place of the\r\nChamperownes. Two more days at Powderham have given another most happy\r\nsight of Charlie and Lady Agnes. Quite a large party were there--the\r\nDowager Lady Fortescue and her pleasant Irish sister Miss Gale; Lord\r\nFortescue with his three daughters and a pleasant and very good-looking\r\nmidshipman son, Seymour; Sir Edward, Lady, and Miss Hulse, and Miss A.\r\nGrosvenor, &c.\r\n\r\n“Lord Fortescue[131] talked much of Mr. Beresford Hope, his oddities and\r\nhis wisdom--how at Oxford he puzzled all the Dons and frightened them\r\nvery considerably by his questions from the Fathers and obscure\r\nChurchmen: how some friend of his, seeing in one of Mr. Hope’s books the\r\nfamily motto, ‘At Spes non fracta,’ wrote beneath, ‘So Hope is not\r\ncracked.’\r\n\r\n“‘In these days of Homeopathy and Romanism,’ said Lord Fortescue, ‘one\r\nnever knows where one is. I never knew what peace or comfort was till I\r\ntook to leaving out the prefix to the word “vert.” Neither party can be\r\noffended by your speaking of “a vert to Homeopathy” or “a vert to\r\nRomanism.”’\r\n\r\n“He talked much of different public men--of the accuracy of Disraeli’s\r\nname for Mr. Cardwell--an inferior imitation of Peel--‘Peel and water:’\r\nof Lord Russell, the ‘abruptness and deadness’ of most of his remarks,\r\nand yet how some of them had passed into a proverb; for instance, his\r\ndefinition of a proverb, ‘One man’s wit and every man’s wisdom:’ of\r\nPeel’s personal shyness and his awkward way of walking up the House, on\r\nwhich occasions O’Connor used to say, ‘Oh, there goes Peel with his two\r\nleft legs.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Ford Castle, Oct. 29._--I came here yesterday after a weary journey\r\nfrom Devonshire to Northumberland. Only Lady Sarah Lindsay, her two\r\ndaughters, and Alick Yorke are here. This morning we had most\r\ninteresting visitors. Two women were seen coming in under the gateway,\r\none in a red cloak, the other carrying a bundle. It was Her Majesty\r\nQueen Esther Faa and the Princess Ellin of the Gipsies!\r\n\r\n“When she had had her breakfast, the Queen came up into the library. She\r\nhas a grand and beautiful old face, and she was full of natural\r\nrefinement and eloquence. She said how she would not change places with\r\nany one, ‘not even with the Queen upon the throne,’ for ‘God was so good\r\nto her;’ that she ‘loved to wander,’ and that she wanted nothing since\r\nshe ‘always drove her own pair,’ meaning her legs.\r\n\r\n“She spoke very simply of her accession--that she was the last of the\r\nFaas; that she succeeded her uncle King William; that before him came\r\nher great-uncle, of whom we ‘must have read in history, Jocky Faa;’ that\r\nas for her subjects, she ‘couldna allude to them,’ for they were such a\r\nset that she kept herself clear of them; that she had had fourteen\r\nchildren, but they were none of them Faas. She spoke of her daughter as\r\n‘the Princess that I have left downstairs,’ but all she said was quite\r\nsimple and without any assumption. She sang to us a sort of paraphrase\r\nof Old Testament history. Lady Waterford asked her if there was anything\r\nshe would like to have. She said she cared for nothing but rings--all\r\nher family liked them; that her daughter, Princess Ellin, had wished to\r\nhave the ring Lady Waterford gave her when she last came to Ford, but\r\nthat she had told her she ‘never meant to take off her petticoats till\r\nshe went to bed;’ that next to rings, she liked ‘a good nate pair of\r\nshoes,’ for she ‘didna like to gang confused about the feet.’\r\n\r\n“When she went away she blessed us. She said to Alick, ‘You _are_ a\r\nbonnie lad, and one can see that you belong to the Board of Health.’ She\r\nsaid to me that she loved Lady Waterford, so that, ‘if it wouldna be too\r\nbould,’ she should ‘like to take her in her arms and kiss her and cuddle\r\nher to her old bosom.’”[132]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 30._--It has been very pleasant having Alick Yorke here. He is\r\nmost amusing. His impersonations are wonderful, and his singing very\r\ngood. Owing to his being here, Lady Waterford has talked much of her\r\nchildhood at Wimpole,[133] the delights of visits to the dairy, and\r\nreceiving great hunches of brown bread and little cups of cream there,\r\nand how, with her ‘mind’s nose,’ she still smelt the smell of a\r\nparticular little cupboard near her nursery, &c.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday we walked to Crookham, as Lady Waterford wished to visit a\r\nman dying there of consumption. Lady Sarah Lindsay went in the\r\ndonkey-chair. She talked of Stichill, the old Pringle place on the other\r\nside of the Tweed. It is now inhabited by a coal-master named Baird, who\r\nhas amassed an immense fortune, but retains all the old simplicity of\r\nhis character. He bought a quantity of books, from the idea of their\r\nbeing proper furniture for the house, but when there was a discussion as\r\nto whether they should be bound in Russia or Morocco, said, ‘Na, but I\r\nwill just ha’ them bound i’ Glasgow, my ain native place.’ In the\r\nevening Lady Waterford sang to us--her voice like a silver clarion and\r\nmost touching--‘Far away, far away,’ till with the melting words dying\r\ninto such indescribable sweetness, one’s whole soul seemed borne\r\nupwards.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 31._--Lady Waterford said, ‘Now I must tell you a story.\r\nSomers[134] came to Highcliffe this year. I like having Somers for a\r\ncousin, he is always so kind and pleasant, and tells me so many things\r\nthat are interesting. I felt it particularly this year, for he was\r\nsuffering so much from a piece of the railroad that had got into his eye\r\nand he was in great pain, but he was just as pleasant as ever. “Oh, love\r\nhas sore eyes,” he said, but he _would_ talk. The next day he insisted\r\non going off to Lymington to see Lord Warwick,[135] who was there, and\r\nwho had been ill; and it was an immense drive, and when he came back, he\r\ndid not come down, and Pattinson said, “Lord Somers is come back, but he\r\nis suffering so much pain from his eye that he will not be able to have\r\nany dinner.” So I went up to sit with him. He was suffering great pain,\r\nand I wanted him not to talk, but he said, “Oh, no; I have got a story\r\nquite on my mind, and I really must tell it you.” And he said that when\r\nhe got to Lymington, he found Lord Warwick ill in bed, and he said, “I\r\nam so glad to see you, for I want to tell you such an odd thing that has\r\nhappened to me. Last night I was in bed and the room was quite dark\r\n(this old-fashioned room of the inn at Lymington which you now see).\r\nSuddenly at the foot of the bed there appeared a great light, and in\r\nthe midst of the light the figure of Death just as it is seen in the\r\nDance of Death and other old pictures--a ghastly skeleton with a scythe\r\nand a dart: and Death balanced the dart, and it flew past me, just above\r\nmy shoulder, close to my head, and it seemed to go into the wall; and\r\nthen the light went out and the figure vanished. I was as wide awake\r\nthen as I am now, for I pinched myself hard to see, and I lay awake for\r\na long time, but at last I fell asleep. When my servant came to call me\r\nin the morning, he had a very scared expression of face, and he said, ‘A\r\ndreadful thing has happened in the night, and the whole household of the\r\ninn is in the greatest confusion and grief, for the landlady’s daughter,\r\nwho slept in the next room, and the head of whose bed is against the\r\nwall against which your head now rests, has been found dead in her\r\nbed.’”[136]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 1, Sunday._--Lady Waterford has talked much of how few people in\r\nthe world each person has to whom their deaths would make a real void;\r\nthat she had scarcely any one--General Stuart perhaps, and Lady Jane;\r\nthat others would be sorry at the time, but that it would to them make\r\nno blank; that somehow it would be pleasant to leave more of a void, but\r\nthat even with brothers and sisters it was seldom so. I spoke of her own\r\nsister and of the great grief her death had been. ‘Yes,’ she said, ‘a\r\ngreat grief, but still it is wonderful how little we had been\r\ntogether--scarcely three years, putting all the weeks together, out of\r\nthe fourteen years we had been married. Of all my relations, Mama is\r\ncertainly the greatest loss to me, we had been so much together\r\nlatterly, and were so much to each other.’\r\n\r\n“Lady Waterford talked much of her mother’s life in Paris as\r\nambassadress, and of her own birth there at the Embassy. ‘I went many\r\nyears after with Mama to Spa, and there was a very agreeable old\r\ngentleman there, to whom we talked at the _table-d’hôte_. He found out\r\nthat we knew Paris and the people there, and then he talked, not knowing\r\nwho we were, of the different ambassadresses. “Celle que j’ai preféré de\r\ntoutes les ambassadrices,” he said, “c’était Lady Granville.” He saw\r\nsomehow that he had not said quite the right thing, and next day he\r\nwanted to make the _amende_, and he talked of the Embassy again before\r\nall the people, of this room and that room, and then he said, “Est ce\r\nque c’était dans cette chambre, Miladi, que vous êtes accouchée de\r\nMiladi Waterford!” He was a M. de Langy, and was a very interesting\r\nperson. His family belonged to the _petite noblesse_, and at the time of\r\nthe flight to Varennes, after the royal family was captured, theirs was\r\none of the houses to which they were brought to rest and refresh on the\r\nway,--for it was the custom then, when there were so few inns. M. de\r\nLangy’s mother was a staunch royalist, and when she knew that the King\r\nand Queen were coming, she prepared a beautiful little supper,\r\neverything as nice as she could, and waited upon them herself. When they\r\nwere going away, the Queen, who had found it all most comfortable, said,\r\n“Où est donc la maîtresse de la maison? j’ai ête si bien ici, je\r\nvoudrais la remercier avant de partir.” Madame de Langy, who was\r\nwaiting, said simply, “J’étais la maîtresse de la maison avant que votre\r\nmajesté y est entrée.”’\r\n\r\n“We went to church at Etal in the afternoon. Both there and at Ford, it\r\nbeing All Saints’ Day, the sermons were wholly in exaltation of the\r\nsaints, church services, and salvation by works. Lady Waterford was\r\npained by it: coming back she spoke of a simple rule of doctrine:--\r\n\r\n    ‘Just before God by faith,\r\n     Just before men by works:\r\n     Just by the works of faith,\r\n     Just by the faith which works.’\r\n\r\nIn the evening she talked much of her first visit to Italy, her only\r\nvisit to Rome. ‘Char. was just married then, and I was just come out: we\r\nwent _pour un passe-temps_. We travelled in our own carriage, and the\r\nfloods had carried away the bridges, and it was very difficult to get\r\non. It was the year of the cholera, and we had to pass quarantine. My\r\nfather knew a great many of the people in authority, and we hoped to get\r\nleave to pass it in one of the larger towns. Mantua was decided upon,\r\nbut was eventually given up because of the unhealthiness, and we had to\r\npass ten days at Rovigo. We arrived at last at Bologna. The people were\r\ngreatly astonished at the inn when we asked if the Cardinal Legate was\r\nat home: it was as if we had asked for the Pope: and they were more\r\nastonished still the next day when he came to call upon us. We went to a\r\nparty at his palace. He was Cardinal Macchi. I shall never forget\r\nthat party or the very odd people we met--I see them now. The Cardinal\r\nwas in despair because the theatres were closed--“Je vous aurais preté\r\nma loge, et je vous aurais donné _des glaces_!” The next day Rossini\r\ncame to see us--“Je suis un volcan éteint,” he said. Afterwards we went\r\nto Rome and stayed four months there. I liked the society part best--the\r\nballs at the Borgheses’ and those at the Austrian Embassy: they were\r\ngreat fun.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SECRET STAIR, FORD.][137]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Louisa, Marchioness of Waterford_]\r\n\r\n“On Saturday we went to Norham--the Lindsays and I. Even coming from\r\nDevonshire, the interest of this country strikes one excessively. It is\r\nbare, it is even ugly, but it is strangely interesting. There is such\r\nbreadth and space in the long lines and sweeping distances, amidst which\r\nan occasional peel-tower stands like a milestone of history, and there\r\nis such a character in the strange, jagged, wind-tossed, storm-stricken\r\ntrees. But it became really beautiful when we descended into the lovely\r\nvalley of the Tweed with all its radiant autumnal tints, and sat under\r\nthe grand mass of ruin, with great flights of birds ever circling round\r\nit and crying in the still air.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 4._--Yesterday we went quite a round of visits, seeing different\r\nphases of Border family life. We lunched at the Hirsel (Lord Home’s)--a\r\ngreat Scotchy-looking house in a rather featureless park. There were two\r\ntables and an immense party at luncheon--Mr. and Lady Gertrude Rolle,\r\nLord Romney, and others. I did not think it an interesting place, though\r\nit contains a fine portrait of Sir Walter Scott by Raeburn; but Lady\r\nWaterford delighted in the happy family life, and says whenever she sees\r\nLord Home she is reminded of the Frenchman who said, ‘Oh, mon Dieu!\r\npourquoi est ce qu’il n’est pas mon père?’\r\n\r\n“We went next to Sir John Marjoribanks of Lees. He was just come in from\r\nhunting, and his wife was fishing in the Tweed. We went to her there:\r\nshe was standing up at the end of a boat which a man was rowing, and\r\nthe whole picture was reflected in a river so smooth that it looked as\r\nif they were floating on a mirror.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORHAM-ON-TWEED.][138]\r\n\r\n“Then we went to the Baillie Hamiltons at Lenels, another and prettier\r\nplace on the Tweed near Coldstream Bridge. The house contained much that\r\nwas interesting, especially two enormous Chelsea vases representing\r\n‘Air’ and ‘Water.’ Mrs. Baillie Hamilton was a daughter of Lord\r\nPolwarth--very pleasing, and her sister came in with the most perfect\r\nmanners of good-breeding, &c. Then we went to the Askews.\r\n\r\n“Lady Waterford stopped to take our luncheon--prepared but not eaten--to\r\na poor man in a consumption. She beguiled the way by describing her\r\nvisit to Windsor, and the Queen showing her the Mausoleum.\r\n\r\n“She talked also of the passion for jewels: that she could understand it\r\nin the case of such persons as Madame Mère, who, when remonstrated with\r\non buying so many diamonds, said, ‘J’accumule, j’accumule,’ for it had\r\nbeen very useful to her. Apropos of not despising dress, she gave me the\r\nquotation from Pope’s Homer’s Odyssey[139]--\r\n\r\n    ‘A dignity of dress adorns the great,\r\n     And kings draw lustre from the robe of state.’\r\n\r\n“Last Monday, having a great deal of natural talent for singing,\r\nreciting, &c., in the castle, Lady Waterford would not keep it to\r\nherself, and asked all the village people to the school, and took her\r\nguests there to sing, &c., to them. At the end, just before ‘God save\r\nthe Queen,’ she was surprised by Miss Lindsay’s ode:--\r\n\r\n    ‘All hail to thee, sweet lady, all hail to thee this night,\r\n     Of all things bright and beautiful, most beautiful, most bright;\r\n     Thou art a welcome guest alike in cottage and in hall,\r\n     With a kindly word and look and smile for each one and for all.\r\n     May every blessing life can give be thine from day to day,\r\n     May health, and peace, and happiness for ever strew thy way;\r\n     May the light thou shedd’st on others be reflected on thy brow,\r\n     May a grateful people’s love and pride like a stream around thee flow,\r\n     And all our prayers unite in one upon this festive e’en,\r\n     That long thou may’st be spared to Ford, to reign its Border queen.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 7._--Lord and Lady Warwick have been here for some days. She is\r\nso simple and genial, that the Italian word _simpatica_ is the only one\r\nto describe her.[140]\r\n\r\n“Yesterday, Lady Waterford, Miss Lindsay, and I had a delightful long\r\nwalk across the moor and through charming relics of forest. It was a\r\nsuccession of pictures--long extents of moss backed by ferny hills,\r\ndowny uplands breaking into red rocks, lighted here and there by the\r\nwhite stem of an old birch-tree, and overlooking the softest expanses of\r\nfaint blue distance. We found several curious fungi. Lady Waterford said\r\nthat at Balmoral the Duchess of Edinburgh shocked the royal household by\r\neating almost all she found. They thought she would be poisoned; but in\r\nRussia they are accustomed to eat fungi, and they make little patties of\r\nthem which they eat in Lent when meat is forbidden--‘and they taste so\r\nlike meat that there is almost the pleasure of doing something which is\r\nnot quite right.’\r\n\r\n“The objects of the walk were two. One was the fall of the Rowling Lynn\r\nin a chaos of red and grey rocks overhung by old birch-trees, a spot\r\nwhich seems photographed in Coleridge’s lines--\r\n\r\n    ‘Beneath yon birch with silver bark\r\n     And boughs so pendulous and fair,\r\n     The brook falls scattered down the rock,\r\n     And all is mossy there.’\r\n\r\nThe other was the sacrificial stone covered with the mysterious rings\r\nwhich have given rise to boundless discussion among Northumbrian\r\narchæologists. When we reached home, we found the Bloomfields\r\narrived.[141] In the evening Lady Bloomfield told a curious story.\r\n\r\n“‘I was very intimate at Vienna with the Princess Reuss, whose first\r\nhusband was Prince of Anhalt. She was a niece of Queen Teresa of\r\nBavaria. She told me that her aunt was at Aschaffenberg with the\r\nintention of going next day to Munich. In the evening the\r\nlady-in-waiting came in and asked the Queen if she was intending to give\r\nan audience. The Queen said, “Certainly not,” and that “she could not\r\nsee any one.” The lady then said that there was a lady sitting in the\r\nante-chamber who would not go away. Queen Teresa then desired her\r\nbrother to go out and find out who it was. He came back much agitated,\r\nand said it was _sehr unheimlich_ (very uncanny), for it was the Black\r\nLady, and that when he came up to her she disappeared; for the Bavarian\r\nroyal family have a Black Lady who appears to them before a death, just\r\nas the White Lady appears to the Prussian royal family. The next day the\r\nQueen left Aschaffenberg, but being a very kind-hearted woman, she sent\r\nback her secretary to fetch some petitions which had been presented, but\r\nwhich she had not attended to, and when the secretary came into her\r\nroom, he found the Black Lady standing by the table where the papers\r\nwere, but she vanished on his approach. That night, when the old\r\ncastellan of Aschaffenberg and his wife were in bed, the great bell of\r\nthe castle began to toll, and they remembered that it could toll by no\r\nhuman agency, as they had the key of the bell-tower.\r\n\r\n“At that moment Queen Teresa died at Munich. She arrived at three: at\r\nfive she was seized with cholera: at eleven she was dead.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE KING’S ROOM, FORD.][142]\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 8._--The two Miss Lindsays and I have been for a most wild\r\nexcursion into the Cheviot valleys to the Heathpool Lynn--a ravine full\r\nof ancient alders and birch, and a mountain torrent tossing through grey\r\nrocks. The carriage met us at a farmhouse--a most desolate place, cut\r\noff by snow all through the winter months, and almost always cold and\r\nbleak.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 9._--Lady Waterford, Miss Lindsay, and I walked to distant\r\nplantations to see some strange grass, which, from being surrounded by\r\nwater at times, had been matted together so that it formed a thick\r\ntrunk, and branched out at the top like a palm-tree, with the oddest\r\neffect. Lady Waterford talked of an old woman she knew, whose husband\r\nwas very ill, dying in fact. One day when she went to see him, she found\r\nhis wife busy baking cakes, and she--the old woman--said that as he was\r\ndying she was getting them ready for his funeral. Going again some days\r\nlater, Lady Waterford found the man still alive, and she could not\r\nresist saying to the woman that she thought her cakes must be getting\r\nrather stale. ‘Yes, that they are,’ said the wife; ‘some folks are _so_\r\ninconsiderate.’\r\n\r\n“When we returned to the castle, we found that old Mr. Fyler, the Vicar\r\nof Cornhill, had arrived, and he was very amusing all evening. He talked\r\nmuch of Sir Horace St. Paul (a neighbour here), who had become a\r\nteetotaler, and had thrown away all the wine in his cellar. His mother\r\nwas a daughter of Lord Ward, who had challenged and run through with his\r\nsword a brother officer, who, when he was engaged to his wife, had\r\nsnatched away a brooch he had given her and exhibited it at mess as her\r\npresent. It was the Lord Ward who was brother of Lady St. Paul, who was\r\nmade the prominent figure in the picture by Copley of the death of the\r\nEarl of Chatham. It is a grand portrait in a fine picture, and Copley\r\ngave the life-size sketch which he made for it to the Ward family.\r\n\r\n“When Sir Horace St. Paul was at college, he found a man lying drunk in\r\nthe quadrangle and tried to make him get up. ‘You’re drunk,’ he said;\r\n‘you don’t even know who I am.’--‘Yes, I know very well who you are,’\r\nsaid the man; ‘you’re the fellow that wrote an epistle to Timothy and\r\nnever got an answer.’ I have heard this quoted as one of the naturally\r\nclever retorts of drunken men.\r\n\r\n“Lady Waterford told Lord Grey’s story of the death--in a court in\r\nEdinburgh--of a naval captain who had been noted for his cruelties at\r\nsea, but especially in the slave trade. Mental terror made his death-bed\r\nmost appalling. According to Scottish custom, the family opened the door\r\nfor the spirit to pass more easily, when, to their horror, the bloody\r\nhead of a black man suddenly rolled into the room.\r\n\r\n“The dying man gave the most fearful scream, and his relations rushed to\r\nhis bedside. When they looked round, the head was gone, but there was\r\nfresh blood upon the floor. To them it seemed inexplicable, but the fact\r\nwas that Professor Owen had been attending an anatomical séance at which\r\nthe body of a black man had been dissected, and there was something so\r\ncurious in the way in which the head had been attached to the body, that\r\nhe had obtained leave to carry it home in a cloth, that he might examine\r\nit more carefully. It was a very slippery, wet day, and as he was\r\npassing the open door of the dying man, the Professor had stumbled, and\r\nthe head, slipping out of the cloth, had rolled into the house; then, in\r\nthe moment when they were all occupied with the dying man, he had\r\npursued it and whipped it up into the cloth again, and hoped it had not\r\nbeen observed.”[143]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 10._--Last night Mr. Fyler told his famous story of ‘the nun.’ It\r\nis briefly this:--\r\n\r\n“A son of Sir J. Stuart of Allanbank, on the Blackadder, where Lady\r\nBoswell lives now, was in Rome, where he fell in love with a novice in\r\none of the convents. When his father heard of it, he was furious, and\r\nsummoned him home. Young Stuart told the nun he must leave Rome, and she\r\nimplored him to marry her first; but he would do nothing of the kind,\r\nand, as he left, she flung herself under his carriage; the wheels went\r\nover her, and she was killed. The first thing the faithless lover saw on\r\nhis return to Scotland was the nun, who met him in the bridal attire she\r\nwas to have worn, and she has often appeared since, and has become known\r\nin the neighbourhood as ‘Pearlin Jean.’ On one occasion seven ministers\r\nwere called in to lay her, but with no effect.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Fyler says that when people on the Border are not quite right in\r\ntheir heads, they are said to ‘want twopence in the shilling.’ A poor\r\ncooper at Cornhill was one of these, and one day he disappeared. The\r\ngreatest search was made for the missing man, for he was a Johnson, and\r\nalmost all the village at Cornhill are Johnsons--fishermen. So every one\r\nwent out to look, and though nothing was found, they came to the\r\nconclusion that he had been drowned in the Tweed.\r\n\r\n“That evening Mr. Fyler observed that his church windows had not been\r\nopened as he desired, and going up to them and looking in, he saw a\r\nwhite figure wrapped in a sheet walking up and down the aisle and\r\nflapping its arms. He went back and said, ‘I’ve found the lost man. He\r\nis in the church, and two of the strongest men in the place must go with\r\nme and get him out.’ But if any one else had looked into the church,\r\nthey would have thought it was a ghost. As it was, one of the men who\r\ncame to get him out fainted dead away.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Winton Castle, Nov. 14._--Dear Lady Ruthven is stone deaf, almost\r\nblind, and her voice like waggon-wheels, but--in her eighty-sixth\r\nyear--she is as kind and good and as truly witty as ever.\r\n\r\n“On Friday we went to Gosford--five in the carriage. It is a dull flat\r\npark, redeemed by being so near the sea, and contains two great houses\r\nclose to each other, of which one--the modern one--has never been\r\ninhabited, as sea-sand was mixed with its mortar. We found old Lady\r\nWemyss[144] sitting behind a screen, much like a lady-abbess in\r\nappearance. I was most warmly received by two child-friends--little Lady\r\nEva Greville and her brother Sidney--a charming boy with dark eyes and\r\nlight flowing hair. Then Lady Warwick came in with Lady Jane Dundas,\r\nand, with one hand-candle, showed us the pictures, just as Lady Elcho\r\ndid many years ago.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday we went to Ormistoun, an attractive place, to see the\r\nDempsters, the uncle and aunt who brought up the authoress of\r\n‘Vera’--charming old people. He talked much of former times in Scotland,\r\nand said that much the most agreeable women in the country were\r\nconsidered to be Lady Ruthven and Mrs. Stewart Mackenzie. He described\r\nthe attachment of one of Mrs. Stewart Mackenzie’s sisters--a certain\r\nvery untidy Frances Mackenzie--to Thorwaldsen, but they were not allowed\r\nto marry. The last word Thorwaldsen spoke was ‘Francesca.’\r\n\r\n“In the garden of Ormistoun is a yew six hundred years old, but with\r\nevery appearance of being still quite in its prime, growing hard, and\r\nlikely to do so for another six hundred years. John Knox is said to have\r\npreached under it.\r\n\r\n“I sat by Lady Ruthven at dinner. She talked of the quaintnesses of her\r\nvillage people. The schoolmaster was very particular about\r\npronunciation. When his wife died, some one came in and said, ‘What a\r\nvery lamēntable,’ &c.--‘Oh, do say lamentable,’ interrupted the\r\nschoolmaster. When the minister was marrying a couple he said, ‘Art thou\r\nwilling to take this woman,’ &c.?--‘Yes, I am _willing_,’ replied the\r\nbridegroom, ‘but I had rather it had been her sister.’\r\n\r\n“To-day Lady Ruthven walked with me to the kirk. She had neither her\r\n‘speaking tubes’ nor her slate, so I could not answer her, but she told\r\nme the whole story of Lady Belhaven’s death, how it was ‘all arranged as\r\nwas best for her, just a gentle passing away, almost unconscious, but\r\nperfectly happy;’ yet how, though one glibly _said_, ‘God’s will be\r\ndone,’ it was _so_ hard to feel it. In returning, she talked of the\r\ntrees, how the forester wished her to cut one down where there were two\r\nclose together, but how she was ‘unwilling to separate friends who had\r\nlived together so long.’\r\n\r\n“One day Lady Ruthven had a letter asking for the character of her\r\nfootman, John Smith, who was leaving her--if he was ‘clever, honest,\r\nsober, a Christian, a recipient of the Holy Communion,’ &c. She\r\nanswered, ‘If John Smith could answer to half your demands, I should\r\nhave married him long ago.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Raby Castle, Nov. 20._--A week here with a large party, which I began\r\nto think delightful as soon as I could cure myself of the uncomfortable\r\nsensation of being so much behind my kind, all the other people knowing\r\neach other better, and being more in possession of their tongues and\r\nfaculties than myself. ‘Be insignificant, and you will make no enemies,’\r\nis, however, a very good piece of advice I once received. Interesting\r\nmembers of the circle have been the Fitzwilliams from Wentworth, and the\r\nQuaker family of Pease, of whom the mother is one of the sweetest, most\r\ncharming people I ever saw, like a lovely picture by Gainsborough, and\r\nwith the expression of one of Perugino’s angels. But the great feature\r\nof the visit has been the Butes, and I have been absorbed by them. I\r\nnever expected to make much acquaintance, but from the first Lord\r\nBute[145] annexed himself to me, perhaps because he thought I was shy,\r\nand because of other people he felt very shy himself. He has great\r\nsweetness and gentleness of manner, and a good-looking, refined face.\r\n\r\n“Lady Bute[146] says the happiest time in her life was the winter they\r\nspent in Majorca, because then she got away, not only from all the fine\r\npeople, but from all the people who wanted to know what they thought\r\nmust be the fine people; but that it was such a bore even there bearing\r\na name for which the natives _would_ raise their prices. Next winter\r\nthey mean to spend at Nazareth, where they will hire the Bishop’s house;\r\n‘no one can get at us there.’ They are supposed to long very anxiously\r\nfor the birth of a son, for now--\r\n\r\n    ‘That little something unpossess’d\r\n     Corrodes and poisons all the rest.’[147]\r\n\r\n“I walked with Lord Bute each day. It was like reading ‘Lothair’ in the\r\noriginal, and most interesting at first, but became somewhat monotonous,\r\nas he talks incessantly--winding into his subject like a serpent, as\r\nJohnson said of Burke--of altars, ritual, liturgical differences; and he\r\noften almost loses himself, and certainly quite lost me, in sentences\r\nabout ‘the Unity of the Kosmos,’ &c.\r\n\r\n“He spoke much of Antichrist--the mark 666, the question if it had been\r\nNero, or if Nero was only a type, and the real Antichrist still to come;\r\nand of the other theory, that the reason why no ten thousand were sealed\r\nof Dan was that Antichrist was to come from that tribe, the dying words\r\nof Jacob tending to this belief.\r\n\r\n“He talked much of fasting; that he had often fasted for twenty-four\r\nhours, and that he preferred fasting as the practice existed ‘before\r\nthe folly of collations.’ I asked if it did not make him ill. He said\r\n‘no,’ for if the hunger became too great he took a cigar, which allayed\r\nit, and that he went out and ‘ate the air’ while taking plenty of\r\nexercise; that poor people seldom became thin in Lent, because what they\r\ndid eat was bread and potatoes. I said I thought it must make him\r\ndreadfully ill-tempered to be so hungry, and thus conduce rather to vice\r\nthan virtue. He said he did not think it made him vicious; but he agreed\r\nwith me that persons naturally inclined to be ill-tempered had better\r\nfast _alone_.\r\n\r\n“From what he said it was evident that he would like to give up all his\r\ngoods to the poor, and that the Island of Bute stands a chance of\r\nbecoming a vast monastery. He talked much of the Troitska in Russia,\r\nwhere he had been; that the monks there were too lax, and that the\r\nreally desirable monastic life was that of those who lived in the cells\r\nestablished some miles off by Philaret, which were subterranean, with a\r\nstove, and no other furniture. When mass was celebrated in their chapel,\r\nthese anchorite monks could faintly discern, down a channel hollowed in\r\nthe rock, the glitter of the candles on the altar, and occasionally,\r\nmingled with this, appeared a ray or two of bluish light, and this was\r\ndaylight. It was the only time they ever saw it.\r\n\r\n“Amongst the young men here is a young Ashburnham, third son of Lord\r\nAshburnham, who reads Greek in his room for his amusement, and is a\r\nlawyer, but says he has not yet been able to realise the hymn, ‘Brief\r\nlife is here our portion.’ He told me that the expression of minding\r\nyour _p_’s and _q_’s came from toupets and queues.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Whitburn Hall, Nov. 24._--I returned here from Raby with my Williamson\r\ncousins,[148] who are always so kind that they make one feel at Whitburn\r\n‘où peut’on être mieux qu’au sein de sa famille?’ The place has much\r\ninterest of its own kind. There is something even fine in the vast black\r\ncloud of Sunderland smoke, obliterating the horizon and giving such an\r\nidea of limitless and mysterious space with the long lines of white\r\nbreakers foaming up through the gloom; while at night the ghastly shriek\r\nof the fog-horn and the tolling of the bell, and the occasional boom of\r\na cannon through the storm, give such dramatic effect that one forgets\r\nthe waste inland landscape, the blackened hedges and wind-stricken\r\ncoalfields.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Ravensworth, Nov. 29._--I was one night with poor Cousin Susan\r\n(Davidson), much aged and altered. She lay chiefly on a sofa in her own\r\nsitting-room, with her two favourite white dogs--the ‘boy and\r\ngirl’--Fritz and Lulu, by her side, and half the birds in the\r\nneighbourhood pecking bread and potatoes outside the windows. It seemed\r\na dreary life to leave her to, but she does not feel it so; hers is one\r\nof the cases in which only the body, and not the mind, seems to require\r\nnourishment. Thursday, when I came away, was her rent-day, and she\r\nwished me to go and see her tenants and speak to them at dinner, and\r\nsaid to the agent, ‘I wish that all my tenants should see my cousin;’\r\nbut fortunately the train came at the right moment to save me from this\r\nalarming encounter, which would have given a (probably) wrong\r\nimpression--at least to the tenants.\r\n\r\n“Lord Ravensworth[149] welcomed me with such cordial kindness, and has\r\nbeen so genial and good to me ever since, that I quite feel as if in him\r\nI had found the ideal uncle I have always longed for, but never before\r\nenjoyed. He is certainly the essence of an agreeable and accomplished\r\nscholar, with a faultless memory and apt classical quotations for every\r\npossible variety of subject. He told me, and made me write down, the\r\nfollowing curious story:--\r\n\r\n“It is going back a long time ago--to the time of Marie Antoinette. It\r\nwill be remembered that the most faithful, the most entirely devoted of\r\nall the gallant adherents of Marie Antoinette was the Comte de Fersen.\r\nThe Comte de Fersen was ready to lay down his life for the Queen, to go\r\nthrough fire and water for her sake; and, on her side, if Marie\r\nAntoinette had a corner in her heart for any one except the King, it was\r\nfor the Comte de Fersen.[150] When the royal family escaped to Varennes,\r\nit was the Comte de Fersen who dressed up as coachman and drove the\r\ncarriage; and when the flight to Varennes failed, and when, one after\r\nanother, he had seen all his dearest friends perish upon the scaffold,\r\nthe Comte de Fersen felt as if the whole world was cut away from under\r\nhis feet, as if life had nothing whatever left to offer, and he sunk\r\ninto a state of apathy, mental and physical, from which nothing whatever\r\nseemed to rouse him; there was nothing whatever left which could be of\r\nany interest to _him_.\r\n\r\n“The physicians who were called in said that the Comte de Fersen must\r\nhave absolute change; that he must travel for an unlimited time; that he\r\nmust leave France; at any rate, that he must never see again that Paris\r\nwhich was so terrible to him, which was stained for ever with the blood\r\nof the Queen and Madame Elizabeth. And he was quite willing; all places\r\nwere the same to him now that his life was left desolate: he did not\r\ncare where he went.\r\n\r\n“He went to Italy, and one afternoon in November he drove up to what was\r\nthen, as it is still, the most desolate, weird, ghastly inn in\r\nItaly--the wind-stricken, storm-beaten, lava-seated inn of Radicofani.\r\nAnd he came there not to stay; he only wanted post-horses to go on as\r\nfast as he could, for he was always restless to be moving--to go farther\r\non. But the landlord said, ‘No, it was too late at night; there was\r\ngoing to be a storm; he could not let his horses cross the pass of\r\nRadicofani till the next morning.’--‘But you are not aware,’ said the\r\ntraveller, ‘that I am the Comte de Fersen.’--‘I do not care in the least\r\nwho you are,’ said the landlord; ‘I make my rules, and my rules hold\r\ngood for one as well as for another.’--‘But you do not understand\r\nprobably that money is no object to me, and that time is a very great\r\nobject indeed. I am quite willing to pay whatever you demand, but I\r\nmust have the horses at once, for I must arrive at Rome on a particular\r\nday.’--‘Well, you will not have the horses,’ said the landlord; ‘at\r\nleast to-morrow you may have them, but to-night you will not; and if you\r\nare too fine a gentleman to come into my poor hotel, you may sleep in\r\nthe carriage, but to-night you will certainly not have the horses.’\r\n\r\n“Then the Comte de Fersen made the best of what he saw was the\r\ninevitable. He had the carriage put into the coach-house, and he himself\r\ncame into the hotel, and he found it, as many hundreds of travellers\r\nhave done since, not half so bad as he expected. It is a bare, dismal,\r\nwhitewashed barracky place, but the rooms are large and tolerably clean.\r\nSo he got some eggs or something that there was for supper, and he had a\r\nfire made up in the best of the rooms, and he went to bed. But he took\r\ntwo precautions; he drew a little round table that was there to the head\r\nof the bed and he put two loaded pistols upon it; and, according to the\r\ncustom of that time, he made the courier sleep across the door on the\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n“He went to bed, and he fell asleep, and in the middle of the night he\r\nawoke with the indescribable sensation that people have, that he was not\r\nalone in the room, and he raised himself against the pillow and looked\r\nout. From a small latticed window high in the opposite whitewashed wall\r\nthe moonlight was pouring into the room, and making a white silvery pool\r\nin the middle of the rough boarded oak floor. In the middle of this pool\r\nof light, dressed in a white cap and jacket and trousers, such as masons\r\nwear, stood the figure of a man looking at him. The Comte de Fersen\r\nstretched out his hand over the side of the bed to take one of his\r\npistols, and the man said, ‘Don’t fire: you could do no harm to me, you\r\ncould do a great deal of harm to yourself: I am come to tell you\r\nsomething.’ And the Comte de Fersen looked at him: he did not come any\r\nnearer; he remained just where he was, standing in the pool of white\r\nmoonlight, half way between the bed and the wall; and he said, ‘Say on:\r\ntell me what you have come for.’ And the figure said, ‘I am _dead_, and\r\nmy body is underneath your bed. I was a mason of Radicofani, and, as a\r\nmason, I wore the white dress in which you now see me. My wife wished to\r\nmarry somebody else; she wished to marry the landlord of this hotel, and\r\nthey beguiled me into the inn, and they made me drunk, and they murdered\r\nme, and my body is buried beneath where your bed now stands. Now I died\r\nwith the word _vendetta_ upon my lips, and the longing, the thirst that\r\nI have for revenge will not let me rest, and I never shall rest, I never\r\ncan have _any_ rest, till I have had my revenge. Now I know that you are\r\ngoing to Rome; when you get to Rome, go to the Cardinal Commissary of\r\nPolice, and tell him what you have seen, and he will send men down here\r\nto examine the place, and my body will be found, and I shall have my\r\nrevenge.’ And the Comte de Fersen said, ‘I will.’ But the spirit laughed\r\nand said, ‘You don’t suppose that I’m going to believe _that_? You don’t\r\nimagine that you are the only person I’ve come to like this? I have come\r\nto dozens, and they have all said, “I will,” and afterwards what they\r\nhave seen has seemed like a hallucination, a dream, a chimæra, and\r\nbefore they have reached Rome the impression has vanished altogether,\r\nand nothing has been done. Give me your hand.’ The Comte de Fersen was a\r\nlittle staggered at this; however, he was a brave man, and he stretched\r\nout his hand over the foot of the bed, and he felt something or other\r\nhappen to one of his fingers; and he looked, and there was no figure,\r\nonly the moonlight streaming in through the little latticed window, and\r\nthe old cracked looking-glass on the wall and the old rickety furniture\r\njust distinguishable in the half light; there was no mason there, but\r\nthe loud regular sound of the snoring of the courier was heard outside\r\nthe bedroom door. And the Comte de Fersen could not sleep; he watched\r\nthe white moonlight fade into dawn, and the pale dawn brighten into day,\r\nand it seemed to him as if the objects in that room would be branded\r\ninto his brain, so familiar did they become--the old cracked\r\nlooking-glass, and the shabby washing-stand, and the rush-bottomed\r\nchairs, and he also began to think that what had passed in the earlier\r\npart of the night was a hallucination--a mere dream. Then he got up, and\r\nhe began to wash his hands; and on one of his fingers he found a very\r\ncurious old iron ring, which was certainly not there before--and then he\r\n_knew_.\r\n\r\n“And the Comte de Fersen went to Rome, and when he arrived at Rome he\r\nwent to the Swedish Minister that then was, a certain Count\r\nLöwenjelm,[151] and the Count Löwenjelm was very much impressed with the\r\nstory, but a person who was much more impressed was the Minister’s\r\nyounger brother, the Count Carl Löwenjelm, for he had a very curious and\r\nvaluable collection of peasants’ jewelry, and when he saw the ring he\r\nsaid, ‘That is a very remarkable ring, for it is a kind of ring which is\r\nonly made and worn in one place, and that place is in the mountains near\r\nRadicofani.’\r\n\r\n“And the two Counts Löwenjelm went with the Comte de Fersen to the\r\nCardinal Commissary of Police, and the Cardinal also was very much\r\nstruck, and he said, ‘It is a very extraordinary story, a very\r\nextraordinary story indeed, and I am quite inclined to believe that it\r\nmeans something. But, as you know, I am in a great position of trust\r\nunder Government, and I could not send a body of military down to\r\nRadicofani upon the faith of what may prove to have been a dream. At any\r\nrate (he said) I could not do it unless the Comte de Fersen proved his\r\nsense of the importance of such an action by being willing to return to\r\nRadicofani himself.’ And not only was the Comte de Fersen willing to\r\nreturn, but the Count Carl Löwenjelm went with him. The landlord and\r\nlandlady were excessively agitated when they saw them return with the\r\nsoldiers who came from Rome. They moved the bed, and found that the\r\nflags beneath had been recently upturned. They took up the flags, and\r\nthere--not sufficiently corrupted to be irrecognisable--was the body of\r\nthe mason, dressed in the white cap and jacket and trousers, as he had\r\nappeared to the Comte de Fersen. Then the landlord and landlady, in true\r\nItalian fashion, felt that Providence was against them, and they\r\nconfessed everything. They were taken to Rome, where they were tried\r\nand condemned to death, and they were beheaded at the Bocca della\r\nVerità.\r\n\r\n“The Count Carl Löwenjelm was present at the execution of that man and\r\nwoman, and he was the person who told the Marquis de Lavalette, who told\r\nLord Ravensworth, who told me. The by-play of the story is also curious.\r\nThose two Counts Löwenjelm were the natural sons of the Duke of\r\nSudomania, who was one of the aspirants for the crown of Sweden in the\r\npolitical crisis which preceded the election of Bernadotte. He was, in\r\nfact, elected, but he had many enemies, and on the night on which he\r\narrived to take possession of the throne he was poisoned. The Comte de\r\nFersen himself came to a tragical end in those days. He was very\r\nunpopular in Stockholm, and during the public procession in which he\r\ntook part at the funeral of Charles Augustus (1810) he was murdered,\r\nbeing (though it is terrible to say so of the gallant adherent of Marie\r\nAntoinette) beaten to death with umbrellas. And that it was with no view\r\nto robbery and from purely political feeling is proved by the fact that\r\nthough he was _en grande tenue_, nothing was taken away.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Hutton, Yorkshire, Nov. 30._--I came here yesterday, arriving in the\r\ndark. It was a great surprise, as I expected to find the place amid the\r\nMiddlesborough smoke, to see from the window on awaking a beautiful view\r\nof high moorland fells beyond the terraced gardens. I laugh when I think\r\nhow the Duchess of Cleveland rejoiced in giving Mrs. Pease such a\r\npleasant change to Raby, to see this intensely luxurious house by\r\nWaterhouse, filled with delightful collections of books, pictures, and\r\ncarved furniture, and its almost Arabian-Night-like conservatories.\r\n\r\n“We have been through bitter wind to Guisborough Abbey--only a grand\r\nchurch front standing lonely near a fine avenue of trees in the grounds\r\nof Colonel Challoner.\r\n\r\n“Mr. and Mrs. Pease are excellent. He is member for Darlington, son and\r\nnephew of the famous Pease Brothers. She, formerly a Fox of Falmouth, is\r\none of the most charming people I ever saw, full of the sweetest and\r\nsimplest natural dignity. She lives in and for her children, and though\r\nthe mother of six girls and two boys, looks about six-and-twenty\r\nherself.[152]\r\n\r\n“There is a Mr. Stover here who is amusing. An uncle of his lives in the\r\nhaunted house at Biddick. One day when he came in from shooting, he hung\r\nhis hat on a pole-screen, and sat down by the fire to read his\r\nnewspaper. Presently, looking over his paper, he saw, to his amazement,\r\nhis hat on the top of the screen nodding at him. He thought he must be\r\ndreaming, but watched, and it certainly nodded again. He got up and\r\nwalked round it, when it seemed still. Then he sat down again and\r\nwatched it, and it nodded again, and not only that, but the screen\r\nitself seemed to be moving bodily towards him. He watched it, and it\r\ncertainly crossed part of the pattern of the carpet: of this there could\r\nbe no doubt. Then he could bear it no longer, and he rushed at the\r\nscreen and knocked it over. Underneath was his tame tortoise.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Wentworth Wodehouse, Dec. 3._--This house has a very stately effect as\r\nyou approach it, with a truly majestic portico. On the first floor is an\r\nimmense hall like those in the great Roman houses, and on either side\r\ndiverge the reception rooms, hung with pictures. Amongst the portraits\r\nare several of the great Lord Strafford, with his parents, his son, and\r\nhis two daughters--Anne and Arabella. Of these, the elder married the\r\nMarquis of Rockingham, from whom the present owners are descended. The\r\npicture by Vandyke of Lord Strafford and his secretary is glorious. The\r\nrooms themselves want colour and effect. Sixty guests can stay in the\r\nhouse, and a hundred and twenty can dine without any crowd, but the\r\nplace needs great parties of this kind, for smaller ones are lost in\r\nthese vast suites of too lofty rooms. Lord Fitzwilliam[153] is the very\r\ntype of a high-bred nobleman, and Lady Fitzwilliam[154] has a sweet and\r\ngentle manner; but Lady F. is calm and placid, her two daughters calmer\r\nand placider, and Lord F. calmest and placidest.\r\n\r\n“To-day we were taken by Lord Fitzwilliam to the two churches. One by\r\nPearson is new and most magnificent; the other is old and very ugly, but\r\nhas interesting monuments. That of Lord Strafford is mural, with his\r\nfigure kneeling near the altar. The epitaph does not allude to the\r\nmanner of his death, but, after setting forth his virtues, simply says\r\n‘he died May 8th, 1641.’ The ghost of Lord Strafford is still said to\r\nwalk down the oak staircase at Wentworth every Friday night, carrying\r\nhis head. An old gateway with several fragments of the house of his time\r\nremain, and many of his books are preserved in the library. My bedroom\r\nis hung with white worked with red by his daughter Lady Rockingham.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 4._--Lady Fitzwilliam has been showing us the house. It contains\r\nmuch of interest, especially in the pictures, and they are repeated so\r\noften that one learns to know the family faces--Lord Strafford and his\r\nthree wives, his son and his two daughters by his second wife, and the\r\nsecond Lord Strafford with his wife, who was the daughter of James, Earl\r\nof Derby, and Charlotte de la Tremouille. His inscriptions in the Bibles\r\nof her father and mother, which are here, and the many memorials he\r\nraised to her, are so touching that it is quite a shock to find he\r\nmarried again after her death; but in his will he always speaks of the\r\nsecond as only his “wife,” the first as his “deare wife.” He restored\r\nthe old church in her memory, and enjoined upon his descendants always\r\nto keep it up for her sake.\r\n\r\n“Lady Albreda drove us about the park and to the ‘Mausoleum,’ a\r\ncommemorative monument raised to the Minister Lord Rockingham by his\r\nson. It is copied from the Roman monument at S. Remy near Aries, and\r\ncontains, in a kind of Pantheon, a statue by Nollekens of Lord\r\nRockingham surrounded by his friends. The face is from a mask taken\r\nafter death, and the figure is full of power and expression, with a\r\ndeprecatory ‘Oh, pray don’t say such a thing as that.’”\r\n\r\n“_Temple Newsam, Dec. 6._--This great house is four miles from Leeds, by\r\na road passing through a squalid suburb of grimy houses and muddy lanes,\r\nwith rotten palings and broken paving-stones, making blackened pools of\r\nstagnant water; then black fields succeed, with withered hedges,\r\nstag-headed trees, and here and there a mountain of coal refuse breaking\r\nthe dismal distances. It was almost dark as I drove up the steep park to\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n“In an immense gallery, hung with red and covered with pictures, like\r\nthe gallery at Chesney Wold in Bleak House, I found Mrs. Meynell Ingram\r\nand Freddie Wood[155] sitting. It was like arriving at a bivouac in the\r\ndesert; the light from the fire and the lamps gleamed on a little\r\ntea-table and a few chairs round it, all beyond was lost in the dark\r\nimmensity.... Soon other guests arrived--Judge Denman, come for the\r\nassizes at Leeds, and his marshal, young Ottaway, the cricketer; Admiral\r\nDuncombe, the High Sheriff; Mr. Glyn, Vicar of Beverley, the chaplain;\r\nand Sir Frederick Grey and his wife ‘Barberina.’ Some of the pictures\r\nare very fine--a portrait by Titian, several Vandykes, Reynolds’\r\n‘Shepherd Boy,” and some fine Reynolds portraits of Lord and Lady\r\nIrvine, the former possessors of this place--the Templar’s Stow of\r\n‘Ivanhoe.’ They left it to their five daughters in turn. The eldest was\r\nLady Hertford, and, if she had two sons, it was to go to the second,\r\nbut she had only one; the second daughter was Lady Alexander Gordon, who\r\nwas childless; the third was Mrs. Meynell, mother-in-law of the present\r\npossessor.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec, 7._--Deep snow all to-day and a furious wind. But yesterday we\r\nreached Leeds for the assize sermon from the Sheriff’s chaplain, Mr.\r\nGlyn,[156] a really magnificent sermon on ‘What is thy life?’ The music\r\nalso was very fine, and the great church filled with people.\r\n\r\n“This house, where Lord Darnley was born, and whence Lord Strafford\r\nissued his summons to the Cavaliers to meet in defence of the King, is\r\nvery curious. In point of amusement, the Judge is the principal feature\r\nof the present party, and how he does trample on his High Sheriff! He\r\ncoolly said _to_ him yesterday that he considered a High Sheriff as\r\n‘dust under his feet;’ and he narrated _before_ him a story of one of\r\nhis brother judges, who, when his High Sheriff had left his hat in\r\ncourt, not only would not let him go to fetch it, but would not wait\r\nwhile his servants fetched it, and ordered him instantly to take him\r\nback to his lodgings without his hat! In court, Judge Denman was annoyed\r\nby some stone-breakers outside the window, and was told it would cost a\r\nmatter of _£_40 to have them stopped. ‘Stop the noise instantly,’ he\r\nsaid; and the Mayor had to pay for it out of his own pocket. Yesterday,\r\nwhen the snow was so deep, the High Sheriff timidly suggested that they\r\nmight be snowed up. ‘That is impossible,’ said the Judge; ‘whatever the\r\ndifficulties, Mr. High Sheriff, you are bound to see me conveyed to\r\nLeeds by the opening of the court, if the whole of Leeds is summoned out\r\nto cut a way for me.’\r\n\r\n“Lord Strafford was here because he borrowed the house of Sir Arthur\r\nIngram as the largest to which to summon the Cavaliers. Sir Arthur was\r\nrewarded by Charles II. for his devotion to the Stuarts by being made\r\nViscount Irvine.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Ripley Castle, Dec. 12._--In this pleasant hospitable house I greatly\r\nmiss the gentle presence of the beloved Lady Ingilby, who was so long a\r\nkind and warm-hearted friend; but it is pleasant to find her cordial\r\nwelcome still living in that of her son, Sir Henry, and her pretty\r\ngraceful daughter-in-law, who is a daughter of Lord Marjoribanks of\r\nLadykirk.\r\n\r\n“I found here Count and Countess Bathyany, people I was very glad to\r\nsee. They retain their old castle in Hungary, where they are magnates of\r\nthe first rank, but for some years they have lived chiefly in England,\r\nat Eaglehurst on the Solent, and receive there during the yachting\r\nseason. The Countess has remains of great beauty and is wonderfully\r\nagreeable. As I sat by her at dinner, she talked much of Lady William\r\nRussell,[157] and told me the story of Lord Moira’s appearance, which\r\nshe had heard from her own lips.\r\n\r\n“Lady William was at Brighton, where her friend Lady Betty ---- was also\r\nstaying. One day when Lady Betty went to her, she found her excessively\r\nupset and discomposed, and she said it was on account of a dream that\r\nshe had had of her uncle, who, as Lord Moira, had brought her up, and\r\nwho was then Governor of Malta. She said that she had seen a very long\r\nhall, and at the end of the hall a couch with a number of female figures\r\nin different attitudes of grief and despair bending over it, as if they\r\nwere holding up or attending to some sick person. On the couch she saw\r\nno one, but immediately afterwards she seemed to meet her Uncle Moira\r\nand embraced him, but said, with a start, ‘Uncle, how terribly cold you\r\nare!’ He replied, ‘Bessie, did you not know that I am dead?’ She\r\nrecollected herself instantly and said, ‘Oh, Uncle, how does it look on\r\nthe other side?’--‘Quite different from what we have imagined, and far,\r\nfar more beautiful,’ he replied with a radiant smile, and she awoke. Her\r\ndream occurred just when Lord Hastings[158] (formerly Lord Moira) died\r\non a couch in a hall at Malta; but she told the circumstances to Lady\r\nBetty long before the news came.[159]\r\n\r\n“Another story which Countess Bathyany told from personal knowledge was\r\nthat of Sir Samuel Romilly.\r\n\r\n“Lord Grey[160] and his son-in-law, Sir Charles Wood, were walking on\r\nthe ramparts of Carlisle. The rampart is there still. It is very narrow,\r\nand there is only one exit; so if you walk there, you must return as\r\nyou came. While they were walking, a man passed them, returned, passed\r\nthem again, and then disappeared in front of them over the parapet,\r\nwhere there was really no means of exit. There was a red scarf round his\r\nthroat. ‘How very extraordinary! and how exactly like Sir Samuel\r\nRomilly!’ they both exclaimed. At that moment Sir Samuel Romilly had cut\r\nhis throat in a distant part of England.\r\n\r\n“We have tea in the evening in the oak room in the tower, where Miss\r\nIngilby has often had much to say that is interesting, especially this\r\nstory.[161]\r\n\r\n“A regiment was lately passing through Derbyshire on its way to fresh\r\nquarters in the North. The Colonel, as they stayed for the night in one\r\nof the country towns, was invited to dine at a country-house in the\r\nneighbourhood, and to bring any one he liked with him. Consequently he\r\ntook with him a young ensign for whom he had taken a great fancy. They\r\narrived, and it was a large party, but the lady of the house did not\r\nappear till just as they were going in to dinner, and, when she\r\nappeared, was so strangely _distraite_ and preoccupied that she scarcely\r\nattended to anything that was said to her. At dinner, the Colonel\r\nobserved that his young companion scarcely ever took his eyes off the\r\nlady of the house, staring at her in a way which seemed at once rude and\r\nunaccountable. It made him observe the lady herself, and he saw that she\r\nscarcely seemed to attend to anything said by her neighbours on either\r\nside of her, but rather seemed, in a manner quite unaccountable, to be\r\nlistening to some one or something behind her. As soon as dinner was\r\nover, the young ensign came to the Colonel and said, ‘Oh, do take me\r\naway: I entreat you to take me away from this place.’ The Colonel said,\r\n‘Indeed your conduct is so very extraordinary and unpleasant, that I\r\nquite agree with you that the best thing we can do is to go away;’ and\r\nhe made the excuse of his young friend being ill, and ordered their\r\ncarriage. When they had driven some distance the Colonel asked the\r\nensign for an explanation of his conduct. He said that he could not help\r\nit: during the whole of dinner he had seen a terrible black shadowy\r\nfigure standing behind the chair of the lady of the house, and it had\r\nseemed to whisper to her, and she to listen to it. He had scarcely told\r\nthis, when a man on horseback rode rapidly past the carriage, and the\r\nColonel, recognising one of the servants of the house they had just\r\nleft, called out to know if anything was the matter. ‘Oh, don’t stop me,\r\nsir,’ he shouted; ‘I am going for the doctor: my lady has just cut her\r\nthroat.’\r\n\r\n“I may mention here a very odd adventure which the other day befell my\r\ncousin Eliot Yorke. He had been dining with the Duke of Edinburgh at\r\nBuckingham Palace, in company with Captain Fane, commander of H.M.S.\r\n_Bellerophon_ on the Australian Station, who had been well known to the\r\nDuke and Eliot when the former was in the South Pacific in command of\r\nthe _Galatea_. At a late hour Eliot and Captain Fane left the Palace to\r\ngo to their club. The night was cold and wet, and, at a crossing in\r\nPall-Mall, their attention was attracted by a miserable-looking little\r\nboy, ragged and shoeless, who, even in the middle of the night, was\r\nstill plying his broom and imploring a trifle from the passers-by.\r\nEliot, according to his usual custom, stopped to talk to the boy before\r\nrelieving him. The child told him he was a stranger in London, that he\r\nhad walked there to seek his fortune from some place on the south-west\r\ncoast, that he was friendless, homeless, and penniless. The proprietor\r\nof the crossing had lent it to him, with his broom, for that day only:\r\nhe had earned very little, but Eliot’s gift would secure him a lodging\r\nfor that night, and then--he supposed there was nothing for him but\r\nstarvation or the workhouse. ‘And have you really no friends or\r\nrelations in the world?’ said Eliot. ‘Well, sir, it’s the same as if I\r\nhad none; I’ve one brother, but I shall never see him again: I don’t\r\neven know if he is alive.’--‘What is your brother’s name?’--‘He is---- a\r\nsignalman on board the _Bellerophon_, and he’s been away so long, he\r\nmust have forgotten me.’--‘It’s perfectly true,’ said Captain Fane;\r\n‘that is the name of my signalman, and a very smart fellow he is, and I\r\nsee a strong likeness between him and the boy.’ The end of the story\r\nwas, that the two gentlemen secured a lodging for the boy, bought him\r\nsome clothes, and, through Captain Fane’s influence, he has been placed\r\non board one of the training vessels, the _Dreadnought_, for the\r\nmerchant service, to become a good sailor like his brother. But the\r\ncombination of coincidences is most striking and providential. The boy\r\nonly had the crossing for that one night. Captain Fane, almost the only\r\nperson in the world who could testify to the truth of the story, was\r\nonly in London for two nights; and he chanced to be walking with Eliot,\r\nprobably the only person who would have thought of stopping to talk to a\r\ncrossing-sweeper.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Hickledon, Dec. 12._--I came here yesterday, cordially welcomed by\r\nLord and Lady Halifax, and was glad to find the John Greys here. In the\r\nevening my dear Charlie and Lady Agnes came, but our meeting was sadly\r\nclouded by the terrible news of poor George Grey’s[162] death at\r\nSandringham. Charlie had brought back many stories from Bedgebury. Mr.\r\nBeresford Hope told him that:--\r\n\r\n“His uncle Lord Decies, who had lived very much in Paris, met, somewhere\r\nabroad, young Lionel Ashley, a brother of Lord Shaftesbury, then about\r\ntwenty-two, and living abroad, as he was, very much out at elbows. Lord\r\nDecies remarked upon a very curious iron ring which he wore, with a\r\ndeath’s-head and cross-bones upon it. ‘Oh,” said young Ashley, ‘about\r\nthat ring there is a very curious story. It was given to me by a famous\r\nconjuring woman, Madame le Norman, to whom I went with two friends of\r\nmine. She prophesied that we should all three die before we were\r\ntwenty-three. My two friends are already dead, and next year I shall be\r\ntwenty-three: but if you like I will give you the ring;’ and he gave it\r\nto Lord Decies. When Lord Decies returned to Paris, Lionel Ashley came\r\nthere too, and he frequently dined with him. A short time before the\r\nexpiration of the year, at the end of which Ashley was again engaged to\r\ndine with him, Lord Decies was sitting in his room, when the door\r\nopened, and Lionel Ashley came in. As to what was said, Mr. Hope was not\r\nquite clear, but the circumstances were so singular, that when he was\r\ngone, Lord Decies rang the bell, and asked the servant who had let Mr.\r\nAshley into the house. ‘Mais, Milord, M. Ashley est mort hier,’ said the\r\nservant.’[163]\r\n\r\n“Another curious story was that--\r\n\r\n“Lord Waterford (the third Marquis) was one day standing talking to the\r\nlandlord of the little inn in the village close to his place of\r\nCurraghmore, when some one rushed up looking very much agitated, and\r\nsaid that there had been a most dreadful murder in the neighbouring\r\nhills. ‘Then it must be the little one,’ exclaimed the landlord. ‘What\r\ncan you possibly mean?’ said Lord Waterford, feeling that the landlord’s\r\nknowing anything about it was at the least very suspicious. ‘Well, my\r\nlord,’ he said, ‘I am afraid you will never believe me, but I must tell\r\nyou that last night I dreamt that two men came to my inn, a tall man and\r\na little, and in my dream I saw the tall man murder the little man with\r\na very curious knife, the like of which I never saw before. I told my\r\nwife when I woke, but she only laughed at me. To my horror, in the\r\ncourse of the morning, those very two men came to my inn, and I was so\r\npossessed by my dream, that I refused them admittance; but coming back\r\nsome time after, I found that my wife had let them in when my back was\r\nturned. I could not turn them out of my house when they were once in it,\r\nbut going in, some time after, with some refreshments, my horror was\r\nincreased by seeing on the table between them the very knife I had seen\r\nin my dream. Then they paid for their refreshments and went away.’\r\n\r\n“The dream of the landlord and the coincidences were considered so\r\nextraordinary, that as the bridge at Carrick-on-Suir was the only bridge\r\nin that part, and so in a sort of sense divided the country, a watch was\r\nput there, and in course of time a man exactly answering to the\r\nlandlord’s description crossed the bridge and was arrested. In prison,\r\nhe confessed that he had been in the cod-fishery trade with his\r\ncompanion, who had boasted to him of his great earnings. He forthwith\r\nattached himself to him, travelled with him, and watched for the\r\nopportunity of murdering him. His weapon was a knife used in the\r\ncod-fishery, quite unknown in those parts.”[164]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Hickledon, Dec. 15._--I have been indescribably happy here with\r\nCharlie Wood, and every hour spent with him makes one more entirely feel\r\nthat there is no one like him--_no one_.\r\n\r\n                  ‘He is indeed the glass\r\n    Wherein the noble youth may dress themselves.’\r\n\r\nTo be with him is like breathing a pure mountain air of which one cannot\r\nimbibe enough, and which strengthens one for weary months of other\r\npeople. One cannot give greater praise to Lady Agnes than by saying that\r\nshe is quite worthy of him. Charlie’s relation to his parents is\r\nperfect. They often cannot agree with his High Church opinions, but he\r\nnever obtrudes his views or annoys them, and while his whole life is\r\nwhat it is, could they grudge or regret what is so much to him?”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 27._--I have been staying at Brighton with old Mrs. Aïdé, who\r\nlooks like Cinderella’s godmother or some other good old fairy. It\r\namused me exceedingly to see at Brighton an entirely new phase of\r\nsociety--two pleasant old ladies, daughters of Horace Smith, being its\r\nbest and leading elements. Every one was full of the ‘Rink,’ where all\r\nthe young gentlemen and all the young ladies skate all morning on dry\r\nland, come home to luncheon, and skate again all afternoon. No balls or\r\npicnics can promote the same degree of intimacy which is thus\r\nengendered, young men walking about (on wheels) all day long, holding up\r\nand assisting their partners. I heard this curious story:--\r\n\r\n“The Princess Dolgorouki had been a great heiress and was a person of\r\ngreat wealth and importance. One day she was driving through a village\r\nnear S. Petersburg, when she heard the clear glorious voice of a young\r\ngirl ringing through the upper air from a high window of one of the poor\r\nhouses by the wayside. So exquisitely beautiful was the voice, that the\r\nPrincess stopped her carriage to listen to it. The voice rang on and on\r\nfor some time, and, when it ceased, the Princess sent into the house to\r\ninquire who the singer had been. ‘Oh,’ they said, ‘it is one of your own\r\nserfs: it is the girl Anita;’ and they brought the singer out, a sweet,\r\nsimple, modest-looking girl of sixteen, and at the bidding of the\r\nPrincess she sang again, quite simply, without any shyness, in the road\r\nby the side of the carriage. The Princess was greatly captivated by her,\r\nand finding that she was educated beyond most of those in her condition\r\nof life, and being at that time in want of a reader in her palace at S.\r\nPetersburg, she took her to live with her, and Anita occupied in her\r\nhouse a sort of intermediate position, arranging the flowers, and\r\nreading when she was wanted. Gradually the Princess became very fond of\r\nher, and gave her masters, under whom she made such astonishing\r\nprogress, that she became quite a well-educated young lady, while her\r\nglorious voice formed the great attraction to all parties at the\r\nDolgorouki Palace.\r\n\r\n“The Princess Dolgorouki never foresaw, what actually happened, that\r\nwhen her son returned from ‘the grand tour,’ which young men made then,\r\nand found a very beautiful, interesting girl domesticated with his\r\nmother, he would fall in love with her. When she saw that it was so, she\r\nsaid to her son that she had a great regard for the girl and could not\r\nhave her affections tampered with, so that he had better go away again.\r\nThe young prince answered that he had no idea whatever of tampering with\r\nthe girl’s affections, that he loved her and believed that she loved\r\nhim, and that he meant to marry her.\r\n\r\n“On hearing this the fury of the Princess knew no bounds. She tried to\r\nreason with her son, and when she found him perfectly impracticable, she\r\nexpelled him from her house and got him sent to France. She also sent\r\nfor the parents of Anita, and told them that they must look out at once\r\nfor a suitable person for her to marry, for that she must be married\r\nbefore Prince Dolgorouki returned. She said that she had no complaint to\r\nmake of the girl, and that she would help her to make a good marriage by\r\ngiving her a very handsome dowry; all that she required was that she\r\nshould be married at once. Before leaving, however, Prince Dolgorouki\r\nhad found means to be alone for a few minutes with Anita, and had said\r\nto her, ‘I know my mother well, and I know that as soon as I am gone she\r\nwill try to insist upon your marriage. She will not consider you, and\r\nwill sacrifice you to the fulfilment of her own will. Have faith,\r\nhowever, in me, hold out, and believe that, however impossible it may\r\nseem, I shall be able at the last moment to save you.’\r\n\r\n“The bridegroom whom Anita’s father found was a certain Alexis\r\nAlexandrovitch, a farmer near their village and a person in a\r\nconsiderably higher position than their own. He was rich, he was much\r\nesteemed, he was greatly in love with Anita, but he was vulgar, he was\r\nhideous, he was almost always drunk, and Anita hated him. He came to her\r\nfather’s house and proposed. She refused him, but he persisted in\r\npersecuting her with his attentions, and her own family tried to force\r\nher consent by ill-treatment, half-starved her, cut her off from all\r\ncommunication with others and from all her usual employments, and shut\r\nher up in a room at the top of the house.\r\n\r\n“At last, when the girl’s position was becoming quite untenable and her\r\ncourage was beginning to give way, Prince Dolgorouki contrived to get a\r\nnote conveyed to her. He said, ‘I know all you are suffering; it is\r\nimpossible that you can go on like this. Pretend to accede to their\r\nwishes. Accept Alexis Alexandrovitch, but believe that I will save you\r\nat the last moment.’\r\n\r\n“So Anita said to her father and mother that she gave in to their\r\nwishes, that she would marry Alexis Alexandrovitch. And the wedding-day\r\nwas fixed and the wedding-feast was prepared. And the old Princess\r\nDolgorouki gave not only a very handsome dowry, but a very splendid set\r\nof peasant’s jewellery to the bride. She did not intend to be present at\r\nthe ceremony herself, but she would send her major-domo to represent\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“The wedding-day arrived, and the bride went with her family to the\r\nchurch, which was darkened, with candles burning everywhere. And Alexis\r\nAlexandrovitch also arrived, rather more drunk than usual. The church\r\nwas thronged with people from end to end, for the place was within a\r\ndrive of S. Petersburg, and it was fine weather, and hundreds of persons\r\nwho remembered Anita and had admired her wonderful voice at the\r\nDolgorouki palace drove out to see her married. According to the custom\r\nof the Greek Church, the register was brought to be signed before the\r\nceremony. He signed his name ‘Alexis Alexandrovitch,’ and she signed\r\nher name ‘Anita.’ And the service began, and the crowd pressed thicker\r\nand thicker round the altar, and there was a constant struggle to see.\r\nAnd the service went on, and the crowd pressed more closely still, and\r\nsomehow in the press the person who stood next to Anita was not Alexis\r\nAlexandrovitch, and the service went on, and Anita was married, and then\r\nthe crowd opened to let the bridal pair pass through, and Anita walked\r\nrapidly down the church on the arm of her bridegroom, and it was not\r\nAlexis Alexandrovitch, and it was Prince Dolgorouki. And a carriage and\r\nfour was waiting at the church door, and the bridal pair leapt into it\r\nand were whirled rapidly away.\r\n\r\n“The old Princess Dolgorouki sent at once to stop them at the frontier,\r\nbut the flight had been so well arranged, that she was too late. Then\r\nshe swore (having everything in her own power) that she would cut off\r\nher son without a penny, and that she would never see him again. Happy\r\nin each other’s love, however, the young Prince and Princess Dolgorouki\r\nlived at Paris, where, though they were poor, Anita’s wonderful voice\r\ncould always keep them from want. There, their two children were born.\r\nFour years elapsed, and they heard nothing from their Russian home. Then\r\nthe family lawyer in S. Petersburg wrote to say that the old Princess\r\nDolgorouki was dead. Whether she had repented of disinheriting her son\r\nand had destroyed her will before her death, or whether she had put off\r\nmaking her unjust will till it was too late, no one ever knew. The will\r\nof disinheritance was never found, and her son was the heir of all his\r\nmother’s vast estates.\r\n\r\n“The young couple set out with their children for Russia to take\r\npossession, but it was in the depth of winter, the Prince was very\r\ndelicate, and the change to the fierce cold of the north made him very\r\nill, and at some place on the frontier--Wilna, I think--he died. The\r\nunhappy widow continued her journey with her children to S. Petersburg,\r\nbut when she arrived, the heir-at-law had taken possession of\r\neverything. ‘But I am here; I am the Princess Dolgorouki,’ she said.\r\n‘No,’ was the answer; ‘you have been residing for four years with Prince\r\nDolgorouki, but the person you married was Alexis Alexandrovitch, and\r\nthe register in which you both signed your names before your marriage\r\nexists to prove it.’ A great lawsuit ensued, in which the young widow\r\nlost almost all the money she had, and eventually she lost her lawsuit\r\ntoo, and retired in great penury to Warsaw, where she maintained herself\r\nand her children by singing and giving music lessons.\r\n\r\n“But at Warsaw, as at Paris, her beauty and gentleness, and the patience\r\nwith which she bore her misfortunes, made her a general favourite.\r\nAmongst those who became devoted to her was a young lawyer, who examined\r\ninto the evidence of the trial which had taken place, and then, going to\r\nher, urged her to try again. She resisted, saying that the case was\r\nhopelessly lost, and besides, that she was too poor to reopen it. The\r\nlawyer said, ‘If you regain the vast Dolgorouki inheritance, you can pay\r\nme something: it will be a drop in the ocean to you; but if the lawsuit\r\nfails I shall expect no payment.’ So she let him try.\r\n\r\n“Now the lawyer knew that there was no use in contending against the\r\nregister, but he also felt that as--according to his view--in the eyes\r\nof God his client had been Princess Dolgorouki, there was no harm in\r\ntampering with that register if it was possible. It was no use, however,\r\nto alter it, as hundreds of witnesses existed who had seen the register\r\nas it was, and who knew that it contained the name of Alexis\r\nAlexandrovitch as the husband of Anita, for the trial had drawn\r\nattention to it from all quarters. It was also most difficult to see the\r\nregister at all, because it was now most carefully guarded. But at last\r\nthere came a time when the young lawyer was not only able to see the\r\nregister, but when for three minutes he was left alone with it. And he\r\ntook advantage of those three minutes to do what?\r\n\r\n“He scratched out the name, or part of the name of Alexis\r\nAlexandrovitch, and he wrote the name of Alexis Alexandrovitch over\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“Then when people came and said, ‘But here is the register--here is the\r\nname of Alexis Alexandrovitch,’ he said, ‘Yes, there is certainly the\r\nname of Alexis Alexandrovitch, but if you examine, you will find that it\r\nis written over something else which has been scratched out.’\r\n\r\n“And the case was tried again, and the young widow was reinstated in the\r\nDolgorouki property, and she was the grandmother of the present Prince\r\nDolgorouki.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Dec. 28._--Lea says, ‘You may put ought to ought (0 to 0)\r\nand ought to ought till it reaches to London, and it will all come to\r\nnothing at last if you don’t put another figure to it’--apropos of Mr.\r\nG.

Surely never was there a\r\nmore open, lovable, unselfish, charming, and truly noble character. She\r\nwas the one person in England capable ‘tenir salon,’ to succeed--in a\r\nfar more charming way--to Lady Palmerston’s celebrity in that respect.\r\n\r\n    ‘Sat vixit, bene qui vixit spatium brevis aevi:\r\n     Ignavi numerant tempore, laude boni.’\r\n\r\nApparently radiant with happiness, and shedding happiness on all around\r\nher, she yet had often said latterly that she ‘did not feel that the\r\ncompensations made up for the anxieties of life,’ and that she longed to\r\nbe at rest.\r\n\r\n“In the agreeable party at Battle it has been a great pleasure to find\r\nthe French Ambassador and the Comtesse de Jarnac. Lord Stanhope is here,\r\nand has talked pleasantly as usual. Apropos of the custom of the living\r\nalways closing the eyes of the dead, he reminded us of the admirable\r\ninscription over the door of the library at Murcia, ‘Here the dead\r\n_open_ the eyes of the living.’\r\n\r\n“He said how the Pineta at Ravenna was really a change in gender from\r\nthe original name Pinetum in the singular: first it had become the\r\nplural of that; then Pineta itself had become a singular word.\r\n\r\n“He described a dreary Sunday spent in Sabbatarian Glasgow, and how,\r\neverything else being shut up and forbidden, he had betaken himself for\r\nhours to examining the epitaphs in the churchyard, and at length found a\r\nsingle verse which atoned for the badness of all the rest:--\r\n\r\n    ‘Shed not for me the bitter tear,\r\n     Nor pour for me the vain regret,\r\n     For though the casket is not here,\r\n     The gem within it sparkles yet.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 27._--Count Nesselrode has come.

He says that he answers, ‘Est que à\r\nmon âge je puis songer à me marier?’ and that they reply, ‘Avec le nom\r\nque vous portez, M. le Comte, on est toujours jeune.’ ... ‘et ça me\r\ndonne le chair de poule.’\r\n\r\n“On the Duchess asking Count Nesselrode after his sons, he said they\r\nwere at a tutor’s, ‘pour former le cœur et l’esprit.’\r\n\r\n“There used to be a ghost at Battle Abbey. Old Lady Webster told Mr.\r\nHussey of Scotney Castle how she saw it soon after her marriage, an old\r\nwoman of most terrible aspect, who drew the curtains of her bed and\r\nlooked in. Immediately after, Sir Godfrey came into the room. ‘Who was\r\nthat old woman?’ she said. ‘There could have been no old woman.’ ‘Oh,\r\nyes, there was, and you must have met her in the passage, for she has\r\nonly just gone out of the room.’ In her old age Lady Webster would\r\ndescribe the pattern on the old woman’s dress, and say that she should\r\nrecognise it anywhere.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PINETA, RAVENNA.][165]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Feb. 1._--A long visit to Lord Stratford de Redcliffe in\r\nLady Jocelyn’s singular house at St. Leonards, which you enter from the\r\ntop story. Lord Stratford is a grand old man with high forehead and\r\nflowing white hair. He can no longer walk, and sits in his\r\ndressing-gown, but his artistic daughters make him very picturesque,\r\nhanging his chair with a shade of purple which matches the lining and\r\ncuffs of his dressing-gown, &c. He talked of many different people he\r\nhad seen, of Goethe, ‘who had a very high forehead’ (but ‘the highest\r\nforehead known was that of the immortal Shakspeare, who had every great\r\nquality that could exist phrenologically’), and then he spoke of\r\nMezzofanti, whom he had known personally in Italy, and who had told him\r\nthe story of his life. He had been a carpenter’s apprentice, and had one\r\nday been at his work outside the open window of a school where a master\r\nwas teaching. Having a smattering of Greek, which he had taught himself,\r\nhe felt sure that he detected the master in giving a wrong explanation.\r\nThis worried him so much that he could not get it out of his head, and,\r\nafter the school and his own work were both over, he rang the bell and\r\nbegged to see the master. ‘I was at work, sir, and I heard you speaking,\r\nand I think you gave such and such an explanation in Greek.’--‘Well, and\r\nwhat do you know about Greek?’--‘Not much, sir; but, if you will forgive\r\nmy saying so, I am sure you will find, if you examine, that the\r\nexplanation was not the correct one.’ The master found that the young\r\ncarpenter was right, and it led to his obtaining friends and being\r\neducated. Lord Stratford said that Mezzofanti spoke English perfectly to\r\nhim, and excellent modern Greek to his servant, and yet that, apart from\r\nhis wonderful versatility in languages, he seemed to be rather a dull\r\nman than otherwise, utterly wanting in originality.\r\n\r\n“Lord Stratford described going to dine one day with his agent, and\r\nmeeting there a lady whose name he did not catch, but whom he was told\r\nto take down to dinner. In the course of dinner the conversation turned\r\nupon some subject of mathematics, ‘And then,’ said Lord Stratford, ‘I\r\ndid what I have never done at any other time on a mathematical\r\nquestion. I tried to explain it and make it easy for my companion, who\r\nlistened with polite attention. When I went upstairs I inquired her\r\nname, and it was ... Mrs. Somerville! I knew her intimately afterwards,\r\nand she told me something of her early life, which I regret should not\r\nhave appeared in her memoirs. Her childhood was passed in Burntisland,\r\nwhither her brother returned for his holidays, having some school-work\r\nto do whilst at home. One day, when he was called out, she took up the\r\nEuclid he had been studying. ‘Ah! what curious little designs! let me\r\nsee if I can understand what it is about.’ And she found that she could,\r\nand devoured Euclid with avidity. Afterwards she got hold of her\r\nbrother’s Æschylus and taught herself Greek in order to read it.\r\n\r\n“Lord Stratford talked much of the extraordinary change, not only in\r\npolitics, but in ‘the way of carrying on politics,’ since he was young.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_69 Onslow Square, Feb. 4._--Aunt Sophy[166] had a pleasant party\r\nyesterday of Theodore Martins, Lady Barker, &c.

As Helen\r\nFaucit she was celebrated as an actress and as having done her utmost to\r\nelevate the stage; but I do not admire her reading of Shakspeare, in\r\nwhich I think there is too much manner. He is evidently most excellent.\r\nHe talked perfectly simply, but only when asked, of his intercourse with\r\nthe Queen, with whom he must be on happy terms of mutual confidence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 7, 1875._--Yesterday, when I was with Louisa, Lady Ashburton, at\r\nKent House, which is being beautifully arranged, Lady Bloomfield came in\r\nand then Mr. Carlyle--weird and grim, with his long coat and tall\r\nwizard-befitting hat. He talked in volumes, with fathomless depths of\r\nadjectives, into which it was quite impossible to follow him, and in\r\nwhich he himself often got out of his depth. A great deal was about\r\nGaribaldi, who was the ‘most absolute incarnation of zero, but the\r\ninexplicable perversity and wilfulness of the human race had taken him\r\nup, poor creature, and set him on a pedestal.’ Then he went on about\r\n‘the poor old Pope, so filled with all the most horrible and detestable\r\nlies that ever were conceived or thought of.’ He was like the man who\r\nasked his friends to dinner and said, ‘I am going to give you a piece of\r\nthe most delicious beef--the most exquisite beef that ever was eaten,’\r\nand all the while it was only a piece of stale brown bread; but the host\r\nsaid to his guests, ‘May God damn your souls for ever and ever, if you\r\ndon’t believe it’s beef,’ so they ate it and said nothing.\r\n\r\n“Then he talked of the books of Mazzini, which were ‘well worth\r\nreading,’ and of Saffi, ‘made professor of something at Oxford, where he\r\nused to give lectures in a moth-eaten voice.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 11._--Sir Garnet and Lady Wolseley, Miss Thackeray, and others\r\ndined. I was not prepared to like Sir Garnet much, a hero is usually so\r\ndull, but he is charming, so frank and candid, and most natural as well\r\nas good-looking. He has a very young face, though his hair is grey,\r\nalmost white. Lady Wolseley is remarkably pretty and attractive; Sir\r\nGarnet was quite devoted to drawing, and had a great collection of\r\nsketches, the work of his life. In the Crimea he drew everything, and it\r\nwas a most precious collection; but in returning it was all lost at sea.\r\nThe rest of his drawings he put into the Pantechnicon, where they were\r\nevery one of them burnt. Miss Thackeray has a sweet voice, which is\r\nmusic in every tone.\r\n\r\n“I have frequently seen lately, at the Lefevres’, old Lord Redesdale,\r\nwith whom we have some distant cousinship through my Mitford\r\ngreat-grandmother. He is very kind, clever, old-fashioned, and always\r\nwears a tail-coat. He took us into the far-away by telling us of having\r\nheard his father, Speaker Mitford, describe having known a man in\r\nSwaledale named Rievely, whose earliest recollection was of being\r\ncarried across the Swale by Henry Jenkyns (who lived to 160), who\r\nrecollected having gone as a boy, with a sheaf of arrows and his elder\r\nbrother on a pony, from Ellerton in Swaledale to Northallerton, to join\r\nthe army before the battle of Flodden. He would tell all about the\r\nbattle in a familiar way--‘the King was not there; but the Duke of\r\nSuffolk was there,’ &c.\r\n\r\n“Much of the conversation in certain houses is now about Moody and\r\nSankey, the American ‘revivalists,’ who are supposed to ‘produce great\r\neffects.’ Moody preaches and Sankey sings. They are adored by some,\r\nothers (including most Americans) think them ‘mere religious\r\ncharlatans’--and altogether they offer a famous opportunity for all the\r\nbarking and biting which ‘truly religious people’ often delight in.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 20._--Dined with the Rafe Leycesters in Cheyne Walk, where they\r\nhave a charming old manor-house with a stone gateway, flagged walk,\r\nancient bay-trees, a wide staircase, and panelled rooms. Mrs. Leycester\r\nwas picturesquely dressed like a picture by Millais. The company were\r\nMr. and Mrs. Haweis, Mr. and Mrs. Tom Taylor, and the Augustus\r\nTollemaches. It was an agreeable party, and a pleasant dinner in a room\r\nredolent of violets.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 21._--Dined with Lady Margaret Beaumont, who talked of dress and\r\nthe distinction of a gown by Worth, which ‘not only looked well, but\r\n_walked_ well.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Thorncombe, Feb. 27._--This place is a dell in the undulating hills\r\nabout five miles from Guildford, very pretty and pleasant; and our new\r\ncousin, Edward Fisher, to whom it belongs, is one of the kindest,\r\ncheeriest, pleasantest fellows who ever entered a family.\r\n\r\n“We have been to see Loseley, which belongs to my old college\r\nacquaintance Molyneux--a grand old house, gabled and grey, with a great\r\nhall, and richly carved chimney-pieces of white chalk, which looks like\r\nmarble. It has three ghosts, a green-coated hunter, a sallow lady, and a\r\nwarrior in plate-armour. The last appeared to the kitchen-maid as she\r\nwas drawing some beer in the cellar, and almost frightened her out of\r\nher wits.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_London, March 7, Sunday._--Breakfast at Lord Houghton’s, who has\r\nadopted Rogers’ custom of social breakfasts. It was a very amusing\r\nparty--Joaquin Miller[167] the American writer, Henry Cowper, Lord\r\nArthur Russell, &c. There was a young man there whom I did not notice\r\nmuch at first, but I soon found that he was very remarkable, and then\r\nthat he was very charming indeed. It was Lord Rosebery. He has a most\r\nsweet gravity almost always, but when his expression does light up, it\r\nis more than an illumination--it is a conflagration, at which all around\r\nhim take light. Joaquin Miller would have been thought insufferably\r\nvulgar if he had not been a notoriety: as it was, every one paid court\r\nto him. However, I ought not to abuse him, as he suddenly turned round\r\nto me and said, ‘Do you know, I’m glad to meet you, for you write books\r\nthat I can read.’ Quantities of good stories were told--one of a party\r\ngiven by George IV. as Prince Regent to the Irish peer Lord Coleraine.\r\nSmoking was allowed. After supper, when Lady Jersey drank, the Regent\r\nkissed the spot upon the cup where her lips had rested: upon which the\r\nPrincess took a pipe from Lord Coleraine’s mouth, blew two or three\r\nwhiffs, and handed it back to him. The Prince was quite furious, but it\r\nwas a lesson.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, March 14._--Went to see Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, who\r\ntalked incessantly and most agreeably for an hour. He said how surprised\r\nhe had been to read in the ‘Greville Memoirs’ of himself as\r\nill-tempered; he always thought he was ‘rather a good-tempered sort of\r\nfellow.’ It was Madame de Lieven who said that, and she had always\r\nhated him. She prevented him having an embassy once, but they made\r\npeace afterwards through a compliment he paid her at Paris. He talked of\r\nMadame de Lieven’s extraordinary influence, arising chiefly from our\r\ninherent national passion for foreigners.\r\n\r\n“I asked Lord Stratford which he thought the most interesting of the\r\nmany places in which he had lived. He said, ‘Oh, England is the most\r\ninteresting by far.’ He described his first going out to Constantinople,\r\nbefore he had taken his degree, only going for four months, and staying\r\nfor four or five years in a position equal to a Minister. He took his\r\ndegree afterwards, and by literary merit, though there was a way then of\r\ngiving degrees to those who were employed in the public service, and\r\nsince then they had made him a doctor of both Universities. Now, in his\r\nhelplessness, he amused himself by writing Greek verses. Once, walking\r\nabout his room, he thought, ‘Well, I have often written Latin verses;\r\nlet me see if I can write Greek.’ And his Greek has all come back to\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe enormous circulation of the “Memorials of a Quiet Life” in the two\r\nyears which had elapsed since its publication astonished those who were\r\nopposed to it; and in America the sale had been even greater than in\r\nEngland. Numbers of Americans had come to England entirely from the\r\ndesire to visit the different scenes of my mother’s quiet life, and had\r\ngone in turn to Toft, Stoke, Alton, Hurstmonceaux, Holmhurst, and some\r\neven to the distant grave of Lucy Hare at Abbots Kerswell. At Holmhurst\r\nthere were frequently many sets of visitors in a day--“pilgrims” we used\r\nto call them,--and even if I was at home I could never bear to refuse\r\nthem admittance, while to my dear old Lea, who was in very poor health\r\nat this time, they were a positive benefit, in rousing her from dwelling\r\nupon sad recollections. It was in answer to a constantly expressed\r\ndesire that, in the autumn of 1874, I occupied myself with the third\r\nvolume of the Memorials, containing more of my mother’s thoughts upon\r\nespecial subjects, and photographs from family portraits and of the\r\nplaces described in the first two volumes. The book was, as it were, a\r\ngift to the public. It had a large circulation, but no remuneration\r\nwhatever was ever looked for or obtained. Soon after the publication of\r\nthe volume, a review appeared in the _Spectator_ (July 8, 1876),\r\nspeaking of “the veiled self-conceit” with which Mr. Hare had placed\r\nhimself “upon the voluminous records of his family as upon a pedestal;”\r\nthat Mrs. Hare was far from being honoured by “the capital” her adopted\r\nson had made of her, though, “if his public likes and is willing to pay\r\nfor the contents of the family album, there is nothing more to be\r\nsaid.... Here, however, let us be thankful, is, so far as anything can\r\nbe predicated safely on such a subject, the last of the ‘Memorials,’ and\r\nthat is so grateful a thought as to justify tolerance of what already\r\nis.” It seemed a singular review to have been admitted by the\r\n_Spectator_, which, four years before (December 11, 1872), had written\r\nof the “Memorials” as containing “passage after passage worthy of\r\ncomment or quotation,” and as “an interesting record of spiritual\r\nconflicts and spiritual joy, free from narrowness and fanaticism, and\r\nmarked throughout by the most guileless sincerity.” I suppose that\r\neditors of reviews, when biassed by intense personal feeling, often\r\ntrust to the public having forgotten what has appeared before in their\r\npages.\r\n\r\nAnnually, I had tried to make my dearest mother’s home as useful as\r\npossible to all those in whom she was most nearly interested, as well as\r\nto keep up her charities, especially at Alton. It had also been a great\r\npleasure, with what my books produced, to fit up a cottage close to\r\nHolmhurst as a Hospice for needy persons of a better class. These I have\r\nalways invited to come for a month at a time, their travelling expenses\r\nbeing fully paid, and firing, linen, farm and garden produce, with an\r\noutfit of grocery, being supplied to them. Many are the interesting and\r\npleasant persons whom I have thus become acquainted with, many the\r\ntouching cases of sorrow and suffering with which I have come in\r\ncontact. In the month of October the Deaconesses of St. Peter’s, Eaton\r\nSquare, for several years occupied the Hospice, and they generally\r\nremained over All Saints’ Day, when they sang the Te Deum in the field\r\nround the twisted tree where the dear mother used to sit--“the Te Deum\r\ntree.”\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1875 I was obliged to go to Italy again, to continue\r\ncollecting materials for my “Cities of Northern and Central Italy.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MARY LEA GIDMAN.\r\n\r\n“_Rimini, April 4, 1875._--I made my first long lonely expedition from\r\nTurin, going for an hour by rail to the town of S. Ambrogio, and then\r\nwalking up through the forests to the top of the high mountain of S.\r\nMichele, where there is a famous monastery in which the sovereigns of\r\nthe country--Dukes of Savoy--used to be buried many hundreds of years\r\nago. It is a wonderful place, quite on the highest peak, looking into\r\nthe great gorges of snow. As I was sketching, the old Abbot was led by\r\non his mule, and stopped to speak to me. I found he was a famous\r\nmissionary preacher--Carlo Caccia--and had been in England, where he\r\nknew Lord Bute well, and was very glad to hear of him. So we made great\r\nfriends, and as he was going to Turin for Easter, we travelled back\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IL SAGRO DI S. MICHELE.][168]\r\n\r\n“From Turin I went to Parma, where I had a great deal of work to finish.\r\nThe cold there was ferocious, but I made the great excursion I went\r\nfor--to Canossa, where the Emperor Henry IV. performed his famous\r\npenance, though it is a most dreadfully fatiguing walk, either in snow\r\nabove the knees, or in the furrows of streams from the melted snow. At\r\nBologna I never saw anything like the snow--as high as the top of the\r\nomnibus, and darkening the lower windows, with a way cut through it\r\ndown the middle of the street. I had the same room at the Hotel S. Marco\r\nwhich you and the dear Mother had for those anxious days in 1870, and of\r\ncourse I seemed to _see_ her there, and it was a very sad visit. The\r\nLibrarian told me that hundreds of people had been to look at the\r\nportrait of Clotilda Tambroni since reading the ‘Memorials.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CANOSSA.][169]\r\n\r\n“We slept here once in 1857, but did not appreciate Rimini properly\r\nthen, I think, for it is a charming place, with a delightful seashore\r\nand interesting old town; but the country is strange and wild, and\r\nthere is not a sign of vegetation on the hedges; so that when I remember\r\nthe buds on the deutzia opposite your window at Holmhurst, it seems most\r\ndismal in Italy.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: URBINO.][170]\r\n\r\n“_Citta di Castello, April 12, 1875._--It is very cold in Italy, but\r\nglorious weather now--ceaseless sunshine and the pellucid skies of\r\nPerugino. I have been many great excursions already; to the Sagro di S.\r\nMichele, to desolate Canossa, and to S. Marino and the extraordinary S.\r\nLeo near Rimini. Then from Forli I paid an interesting visit to Count\r\nSaffi, one of the Roman triumvirate, whom I had known well at Oxford,\r\nand who lives, with his wife (Miss Craufurd of Portincross) and many\r\nchildren, in a farmhouse-like villa near the town. At Ancona, Charlie\r\nDalison came to meet me, a pleasant change after much silence and\r\nsolitude. We went together to Loreto, and next day a dreary journey to\r\nUrbino, which is more curious than beautiful, though there is a noble\r\nold palace of its Dukes. It was a thirteen hours’ drive thence through\r\nhideous country to Gubbio, where the inns are wretched, but the town\r\nfull of interest. Charlie left me at Perugia, and I came on here into\r\nthe Piero della Francesca country, which is more instructive than\r\ncaptivating.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUBBIO.][171]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Forli, April 2._--In one of the old churches here is the tomb of\r\nBarbara Ordelaffi, wife of the Lord of Forli, who was one of the most\r\nintensely wicked women of her own or any other age. But her tomb is\r\nindescribably lovely, her figure, that of quite a young girl, lying upon\r\nits marble sarcophagus with a look of innocence and simplicity which can\r\nscarcely be equalled.\r\n\r\n“The tomb is in a side-chapel, separated by a heavy railing from the\r\nchurch. Inside this railing, in an arm-chair, with his eyes constantly\r\nfixed upon the marble figure, sat this morning a very old gentleman,\r\nparalysed and unable to move, wrapped in a fur cloak. As I looked in at\r\nthe rails, he said, ‘And you also are come to see Barbara; how beautiful\r\nshe is, is not she?’ I acquiesced, and he said, ‘For sixty years I have\r\ncome constantly to see her. It is everything to me to be here. It is the\r\nlove and the story of my life. No one I have ever known is half so\r\nbeautiful as Barbara Ordelaffi. You have not looked at her yet long\r\nenough, but gradually you will learn this. Every one must love Barbara.\r\nI am carried here now; I cannot walk, but I cannot live without seeing\r\nher. My servants bring me; they put me here; I can gaze at her figure,\r\nthen I am happy. At eleven o’clock my servants will come, and I shall be\r\ntaken home, but they will bring me again to see Barbara in the\r\nafternoon.’\r\n\r\n“I remained in the church. At eleven o’clock the servants came. They\r\ntook up the old gentleman and carried him up to the monument to bid it\r\nfarewell, and then out to his carriage; but in the afternoon, said the\r\nSacristan, they would come again, for he always spent most of the day\r\nwith Barbara Ordelaffi; when he was alone with the marble figure, he was\r\nquite quiet and happy, and as they always locked him into the chapel, he\r\ncould never come to any harm.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MARY LEA GIDMAN.\r\n\r\n“_Florence, April 28._--On Monday I went to the excellent inn at Lucca,\r\nand on Tuesday to the Bagni.

Quintilia (our\r\nmaid) was enchanted to see me, but has grown into a very old woman,\r\nthough only sixty-three.\r\n\r\n“I liked Lucca better than all the other places. It was the festival of\r\nS.

Then I crossed the S. Gothard to Lucerne and came on\r\nhere. The semi-mountain air of this lovely place is as refreshing to the\r\nbody as the pure high-minded Bunsen character is to the soul. A little\r\nbranch railway brought me from the main line to Gernsbach, a pretty\r\nclean German village with picturesque gabled houses girding a lovely\r\nriver. Hence it is a charming drive of two hours through forest into the\r\nhighlands, where the wood-clad hills break occasionally into fine crags.\r\nHerrenalb itself takes its name from the abbey on the little river Alb,\r\nwhile a monastery for women on the same stream a few miles off gives its\r\nname to ‘Frauenalb.’ The former is Protestant now, the latter is still\r\nCatholic, but in the valley of Herrenalb are the immense buildings of\r\nthe abbey, its great granaries with wooden pillars, and the ruins of its\r\nNorman church.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOVERE, LAGO D’ISEO.][175]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Frances Baroness Bunsen 1874_]\r\n\r\n“Frances de Bunsen and one of her Sternberg nieces met me in the\r\nvalley, and we were soon joined by the dear old Frau von Bunsen in her\r\ndonkey-chair.

In that moment I am\r\nsure we both tried hard to recollect what had so entirely separated us\r\nfor five years, but we could not, and shook hands.

The Sultan has a good, sensible, clever,\r\namused face, but cannot speak a word of any language except Arabic, of\r\nwhich Lady Salisbury said that she had learnt some sentences by the end\r\nof the evening, from hearing them repeated so often through the\r\ninterpreter, and at last ventured to air her new acquirements herself.\r\nWhen the Sultan went away, the suite followed two and two--a picturesque\r\nprocession. Lord Salisbury walked first, leading the Sultan, or rather\r\nholding his right hand in his own left, which it seems is the right\r\nthing to do.

There the garden was in great beauty, and\r\nwe met Lady Airlie sauntering through its green walks with the Duke of\r\nTeck. We went to sit in a tent, where we found Mr. Doyle, Mr. Cheney,\r\nand a young lady who greeted me with, ‘Now, Mr. Hare, may I ask if you\r\nnever _can_ remember me, or if you always intend to cut me on purpose?’\r\nIt was Miss Rhoda Broughton.\r\n\r\n“Lady Airlie talked of the death of Madame Rossetti. Her husband[178]\r\nfelt so completely that all his living interests were buried with his\r\nwife, that he laid his unpublished poems under her dead head, and they\r\nwere buried with her. But, after a year had passed, his feeling about\r\nhis wife was calmed, while the longing for his poems grew daily, and\r\npeople urged him that he was forcing a loss upon the world. And the\r\ncoffin of the poor lady was taken up and opened to get at the poems, and\r\nbehold her beautiful golden hair had grown and grown till the whole\r\ncoffin was filled with it--filled with it and rippling over.[179] Lady\r\nAirlie had the account from an eye-witness. For one moment Madame\r\nRossetti was visible in all her radiant loveliness, as if she were\r\nasleep, then she sank into dust. She was buried with her Testament under\r\nher pillow on one side and her husband’s poems on the other.\r\n\r\n“The Duke of Teck looked very handsome and was most pleasant and\r\namiable. He said that an old lady in Germany, an ancestress of his, had\r\nthe most glorious pearl necklace in the world, and when she died, she\r\ndesired that the pearl necklace might be buried with her. And the family\r\nwere very sorry to part with their aged relative, but they were still\r\nmore sorry to part with the family jewels; and in time their grief for\r\nthe old lady was assuaged, but their grief for the pearl necklace was\r\nnever assuaged at all, and at last there came a moment when they dug up\r\nthe coffin, and took the pearl necklace from the aged neck. But behold\r\nthe pearls were quite spoilt and had lost all their lustre and beauty.\r\nThen pearl-doctors were summoned, men who were learned in such things,\r\nand they said that the only thing which would restore the beauty of the\r\npearls would be if three beautiful young ladies would wear them\r\nconstantly, and let the pearls drink in all their youth and beauty. So\r\nthe eldest daughter of the house took them and wore them constantly, and\r\nall the beauty and brilliancy of her loveliness flowed into the pearls,\r\nwhich grew brighter and better every day. And as her beauty faded,\r\nanother daughter of the house took them, and so three beautiful young\r\nladies took them and wore them in three generations, till, when sixty\r\nyears were passed, the pearls were so beautiful and glorious, so filled\r\nwith youth and radiancy, that there is no such pearl necklace in the\r\nwhole world.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 28._--Luncheon with dear old Lady Grey. Then to Lady Wharncliffe,\r\nwho looked very lovely seated beneath a great blue-green vase filled\r\nwith lilies.\r\n\r\n“The way young men now weary their friends to ask for invitations for\r\nthem is almost as contemptible as the conduct of the ladies who ask\r\nothers to invite their guests for them that they may ‘get into society.’\r\n‘Que ne fait-on pour trouver un faux bonheur!’ says Fénélon; ‘quels\r\nrebuts, quelles traverses n’endure t’on point pour un fantôme de gloire\r\nmondaine! quelles peines pour de misérables plaisirs dont il ne reste\r\nque des remords.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 29._--With the Archbishop of Dublin, Miss Trench, and Lady\r\nCharles Clinton to Strawberry Hill, the ‘little plaything house’ of\r\nHorace Walpole. It had been so wet that one had almost to wade from the\r\nstation to the house, and the beautiful breakfast was sopping in a tent\r\non the mossy lawn, so little being left in the house that the Princess\r\nof Wales had to drink her tea out of a tumbler in a corner. Still the\r\ninterior of the house was full of interest--the historic pictures,\r\nespecially those of the three beautiful Waldegrave sisters, and of\r\nMaria, Duchess of Gloucester; and then in the gallery are, by Sant and\r\nBucknor, all the especial friends of the house--all the beautiful\r\npersons who have stayed there.\r\n\r\n“Lady Waldegrave[180] (assisted by art) looked twenty-five years younger\r\nthan she did twenty-five years ago. The Princess of Wales, in a pink\r\ndress under black lace and a little hat to match, copied as a whole from\r\npictures of Anne Boleyn, looked lovely.\r\n\r\n“In the evening I went to Lady Salisbury’s reception. At the latter was\r\nthe Sultan of Zanzibar. Suddenly, in the midst of the party, he said to\r\nLady Salisbury, ‘Now, please, it is my time to say my prayers: I should\r\nlike to go into your room, and to be alone for ten minutes.’ And he did,\r\nand he does it four times a day, and never allows anything whatever to\r\ninterfere with it. The Archbishop of Dublin, when presented, said, ‘I am\r\nglad to have the honour of being presented to a man who has made a\r\npromise and _kept_ it.’ The Sultan answered, ‘It can only be your\r\ngoodness which makes you say that.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_How_ glad I am that we do not agree about Sunday. I think your view of\r\n‘the Sabbath’ so entirely derogatory to all the dignity and beauty of\r\nChristianity, and I cannot understand any one not becoming an infidel,\r\nif they think God so _mean_ as to suppose that He would consider ‘His\r\nday’ (though Sunday is only the Church’s day, all days are God’s days)\r\ndishonoured by walking with one’s intimate friends in a garden, or\r\nhaving tea in another garden with several persons, all infinitely better\r\nand wiser than oneself. ‘I am amazed,’ says Professor Amiel, ‘at the\r\nvast amount of Judaism, of formalism, that still exists, eighteen\r\ncenturies after the Redeemer’s declaration that the letter killeth....\r\nChristian liberty has yet to be won.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_June 30._--A very pleasant party in the Duke of Argyll’s garden, in\r\nspite of a wet afternoon; all the little golden-haired daughters of the\r\nhouse very kind in entertaining the guests. I returned with Louisa, Lady\r\nAshburton, to her beautiful Kent House. The rooms, hung with yellow,\r\nwith black doors and picture-frames, are very effective. There are some\r\nsemi-ruined cartoons of Paul Veronese upon the staircase.\r\n\r\n“In the evening I went to Lady Margaret Beaumont’s to meet the Queen of\r\nthe Netherlands, ‘La Reine Rouge,’ as she is often called from her\r\nrevolutionary tendencies. She sat at the end of the room, a pleasant\r\nnatural woman, with fuzzy hair done very wide in curls, and a quaint\r\nlittle diamond crown as an ornament at the back. She was most agreeable\r\nin conversation, and, as Prosper Merimée says in one of his letters to\r\nPanizzi, ‘would have been quite perfection, if she had not wished to\r\nappear a Frenchwoman, having had the misfortune to be born in\r\nWürtemburg.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 1._--Luncheon at Lord Stanhope’s to meet Miss Rhoda Broughton.\r\nLord Stanhope aired one of his pet hobbies--the virtues of the novel\r\n‘Anastasius.’ Mrs. Hussey says that his father used to say of him, ‘My\r\nson is often very prosy, but then he has been _vaccinated_;’ for the\r\nfourth Earl Stanhope had a familiar of whom he always spoke as ‘Tesco,’\r\nand Tesco had inveighed against vaccination to him, and had told him\r\nthat to be vaccinated had always the effect of making the recipient\r\nprosy.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Hussey mentioned this at a dinner to Mr. John Abel Smith, who\r\nexclaimed, ‘Oh, that accounts for what has always hitherto been a\r\nmystery to me. I went with that Lord Stanhope to hear a man named\r\nBelloni lecture on “the Tuscan Language,” and we sat behind him on the\r\nplatform. He was most terribly lengthy. Suddenly, Lord Stanhope caught\r\nhim by the coat, and, arresting the whole performance, said, “Pray, sir,\r\nhave you ever been vaccinated?”--“Certainly, my Lord,” said the\r\nastonished lecturer. “Oh, that is quite enough; pray continue,” said\r\nLord Stanhope, and the lecture proceeded, and Lord Stanhope composed\r\nhimself to sleep.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 2._--A large sketching party at Holland House. We sat for three\r\nhours in the Lily Garden, with birds singing, fountains playing, and\r\nflowers blooming, as if we had been a hundred miles from London. Our\r\nsketches were all sent in afterwards to Lady Holland, who sent them out\r\nin the order of merit--Mrs. Lowther’s first, mine second.\r\n\r\n“I dined with the Ralph Duttons and sat by Lady Barker, who was full of\r\nMoody and Sankey, to whom she has been often with the Duchess of\r\nSutherland, who insists upon going every day. She says the mixture of\r\nreligious fervour with the most intense toadyism of the Duchess was\r\nhorribly disgusting; that the very gift of fluency in the preachers\r\ncontaminated and spoilt their work. Sometimes they would use the most\r\nexcellent and powerful simile, and then spoil it by something quite\r\nblasphemous. Speaking of the abounding grace of God, Moody compared Him\r\nto a banker who scolded the man who only drew for a penny, when he might\r\ndraw for a pound and come again as often as he liked. So far the sermon\r\nwas admirable, and all understood it; but then he went on to call it the\r\n‘Great I Am Bank,’ and to cut all sorts of jokes, whilst the audience\r\nroared with laughter; that when a man presented his cheque, however\r\nlarge--‘Here ye are, says I Am,’ &c.\r\n\r\n“Went on to the ball at Dorchester House, which was beautiful; the\r\nPrince and Princess of Wales and the Tecks were there. The great charm\r\nof the house is in the immensely broad galleries, which are so effective\r\nwhen filled with beautiful women, relieved, like Greek pictures, against\r\na gold background. Miss Violet Lindsay, in a long white dress\r\nembroidered with gold and a wreath of gold oak-leaves, was quite\r\nexquisitely lovely.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DORCHESTER HOUSE.][181]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 3._--Breakfast with Sir James Lacaita to meet Mr. Gladstone, Lord\r\nNapier and Ettrick, and the Marchese Vitelleschi. The great topic was\r\nManning. About him and Roman Catholicism in general, Gladstone seems to\r\nhave lost all temperance, but told much that was curious. He described\r\nthe deathbed of Count Streletski and Manning’s attempts to get in.\r\nLacaita said that there was a lady still living to whom Manning had\r\nbeen engaged--‘fatto l’impégno’--and that he had jilted her to marry one\r\nof two heiress sisters: now, whenever she hears of any especial act of\r\nhis, she says, ‘As ever, fickle and false.’\r\n\r\n“‘False,’ said Gladstone, ‘always, but never fickle.’\r\n\r\n“Lacaita described the illness, the apparently hopeless illness, of\r\nPanizzi, when he and Mr. Winter kept guard. The Padre Mela came and\r\ntried to insist upon seeing the patient. He told the Padre it was quite\r\nimpossible, but, upon his insisting, he assured him that if Panizzi\r\nrallied, he would at once mention the Padre’s wish. At that time it was\r\n‘impossible, as Panizzi was quite unconscious.’ When the Padre heard\r\nthat Panizzi was insensible, he implored and besought an entrance ‘basta\r\nanche un’istante,’ but was positively and sternly refused.\r\n\r\n“The next day Panizzi rallied, upon which both Lacaita and Mr. Winter\r\nthought it necessary to mention the strong wish of the Padre Mela to see\r\nhim. ‘Oh, il birbone!’ said Panizzi, ‘vuol dunque convertirmi,’ and he\r\nwas so excited, that in order to content him they were obliged to engage\r\na policeman to stand constantly at the door to keep the priests out.\r\n\r\n“Gladstone said he knew that the Pope (Pius IX.) had determined against\r\ndeclaring the doctrine of _personal_ infallibility, till Manning had\r\nfallen at his feet, and so urged and implored him to do so, that at\r\nlength he had consented. He (Gladstone) upheld that there was no going\r\nback from this, and that even in case of the Pope’s death, the condition\r\nof the Roman Church was absolutely hopeless. Vitelleschi agreed so far,\r\nthat if a foreign Pope were chosen, for which an effort would be made,\r\nthere was no chance for the Church; but if an Italian were elected--for\r\ninstance, Patrizi or Bilio, who had especially opposed the doctrine of\r\npersonal infallibility--the sense of the doctrine would be so far\r\nmodified that it would practically fade into nothingness, and that every\r\nadvantage would be taken of the Council not being yet closed to make\r\nevery possible modification.\r\n\r\n“Vitelleschi lamented the utter want of religious education in modern\r\nItaly--that he had been in schools where, when asked who Jesus Christ\r\nwas, all the boys differed, one saying that he was a prophet, another\r\nsomething else; that when the question was put to Parliament how\r\nmorality was to be taught without religion, the answer was, ‘Faremmo un\r\ntrattato morale.”\r\n\r\n“Lord Napier every now and then insisted on attention, and delivered\r\nhimself of some ponderous paragraph, on which occasions Gladstone\r\npersistently and defiantly ate strawberries.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 4._--Tea at the Duchess of Cleveland’s. Lord John Manners was\r\nthere. They were full of the dog Minos and his extraordinary tricks. In\r\ninvitation cards to parties, ‘To meet the dog Minos’ is now constantly\r\nput in the corner. When told to take something to the most beautiful\r\nwoman in the room, however, he made a mistake, and took it to the Queen,\r\nwho flicked him with her pocket-handkerchief; and then he took it to the\r\nPrincess of Wales. Being left alone in the room with a plate on which\r\nthere were three sandwiches, he could not resist eating them, but found\r\nthree visiting cards and deposited them in their place!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 7._--A party at Holland House. The old cedars, the brilliant\r\nflowers, and more brilliant groups of people, made a most beautiful\r\nscene.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 8._--A party at Lady Airlie’s for the Queen of Holland--very\r\npleasant.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 9._--Luncheon at Mrs. Harvey of Ickwellbury’s. The whole family\r\nwere full of Nigger stories:--of a man who, being pursued by an Indian\r\nfor the sake of his scalp, and finding escape hopeless, pulled off his\r\nwig and presented it with a bow, upon which the Indian fell down and\r\nworshipped him as a god!--Of a negro who, on being told that the strait\r\npath to heaven was full of thorns and difficulties, said, ‘Den dis ere\r\nnigger take to the woods!’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 11._--To hear Mr. Stopford Brooke preach. It was most\r\ninteresting--upon the love of God. He began by saying that he would not\r\nundertake to prove the existence of God, for ‘God is, and those who love\r\nHim know it.’\r\n\r\n“He said, ‘Think in everything which you are about to do, whether it\r\nwill be for the good of the human race; if not, if it is only good for\r\nyourself, your family, your society, don’t do it: that is the love of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n“‘Fight against all power which in the name of religion seeks to narrow\r\nit. Fight against all, whether of caste or family, which seeks to\r\nelevate one power to the exclusion of another; for the perfection of the\r\n_whole_ human nature, that is God’s will. This is the service we must\r\ngive to Him, which separates worship from selfishness, and makes it more\r\npraise than prayer: thus, with our sails filled with the winds of God,\r\nmay we drive over the storms of the human race to the harbour of\r\nunity.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 12._--To luncheon at Lord Northampton’s, but, except Lady Marion\r\nAlford, I do not much like the Comptons. Lady Alwyn, who is charming,\r\nwas very amusing about them. ‘Lord Alwyn pretends not to hear; that is\r\nbecause he is displeased, for he thinks I am abusing the Comptons. He\r\ncannot bear me to find fault with any of his ancestors, however remote\r\nthey may be, for he thinks that the Comptons are quite perfect, and\r\nalways have been. When I first married, I hoped to have made a\r\ncompromise, and I told Lord Alwyn that if he would give up to me his\r\ngreat-grandfather, I would spare all the rest; but he wouldn’t.... After\r\nall, the Comptons were quite ruined, and we owe everything to old Sir\r\nJohn Spencer who lived at Crosby Hall in the City, and _he_ had so poor\r\nan opinion of the Comptons, that he wouldn’t let the Lord Northampton of\r\nthat day marry his daughter on any account. But Lord Northampton dressed\r\nup as the baker’s boy and carried his bride off on his head in a basket.\r\nHe met Sir J. Spencer on the stairs, who gave him a sixpence for his\r\npunctuality, and afterwards, when he found out that his daughter was in\r\nthat basket, swore it was the only sixpence of his money Lord\r\nNorthampton should ever see. But the next year Queen Elizabeth asked him\r\nto come and be ‘gossip’ with her to a newly-born baby, whom she hoped he\r\nwould adopt instead of his disinherited daughter, and he could not\r\nrefuse; and you may imagine whose that baby was.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSBY HALL.][182]\r\n\r\n“Five-o’clock tea at Ashburnham House. The pictures there are\r\nbeautiful, a Mantegna and several Ghirlandajos, and it is a charming old\r\nhouse in itself. In the evening to a party at the Duchess of Cleveland’s\r\ngiven to the blind Duke of Mecklenburg and his Duchess.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Highcliffe, July 18._--The usual party are here.... Lady Jane Ellice\r\nis full of a theory that she is an Israelite, that we are all members of\r\nthe lost tribes of Israel, that our royal family are the direct\r\ndescendants of Tepha, the beautiful daughter of Zedekiah, who was\r\nbrought to Ireland by Jeremiah, and married to its king.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Hamilton Hamilton has much that is interesting to tell of her old\r\nembassy life in France. She was at S. Leu the day before the Duc de\r\nBourbon’s death. She would not go in, though urged to do so, because\r\n‘that woman, Madame de Feuchères,’ was there, but heard how well the\r\nDuke was, preparing for the chase, ‘never better in his life.’ The next\r\nday, in returning to Paris, their carriage was passed and repassed by\r\nquantities of royal servants riding to and fro. At last they asked why\r\nit was. The Duc de Bourbon was dead, found hung up to the blind of the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n“A few days before, the Duke had declared his intention of altering his\r\nwill in favour of the Comte de Chambord. Previously Chantilly had been\r\nsettled upon the Duc d’Aumale. Madame de Feuchères had said long before\r\nto Louis Philippe, ‘Leave it all to me.’\r\n\r\n“Madame de Feuchères (once an orange-girl at Southampton) was left\r\nenormously rich. She promised to settle all her property on the Duc\r\nd’Aumale if the Duchess of Orleans would receive her. Mrs. Hamilton\r\nHamilton was seated at the end of the room between the Duchesse Decazes\r\nand another great lady of the old régime. Suddenly the Duchess of\r\nOrleans got up and crossed the whole room to receive some one at the\r\ndoor. Generally she remained in her place, making only one step even for\r\na duchess. It was Madame de Feuchères who entered.\r\n\r\n“At the Court of Charles X. it was the Dauphine who received. She was\r\nvery severe in her manner and had a very harsh voice: it was as if the\r\nshadow of the Temple always rested upon her. The Duchesse de Berri was\r\nof gentler manners, but less wise. When the family of Charles X. fled\r\nafter the revolution of four days, the deputation going to offer the\r\ncrown to Louis Philippe found he was out; they found only the Duchess of\r\nOrleans. She was horrified at the very idea and refused point-blank,\r\nsaying that her husband would never do such a wrong to his\r\ncousin--‘Grace à Dieu! mon mari ne sera pas usurpateur.’ Going through\r\nthe garden at Neuilly, however, the deputation met Madame Adelaïde, who\r\nasked what their business was, and being told what the Duchess had\r\nanswered, said, ‘Oh, mais mon frère accepte, certainement il accepte;’\r\nand her view was definitive. She never separated from her brother\r\nafterwards, and he always deferred to her opinion; indeed, as Napoleon\r\nused to say, she was ‘the only man of the family.’ The whole family paid\r\nher great attention. She was enormously rich, and made the Prince de\r\nJoinville her heir. Louis Philippe chose her epitaph in the vaults at\r\nDreux. It is from Gen. xii. 13: ‘Thou art my sister, and it has been\r\nwell with me for thy sake.’\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Hamilton Hamilton was the first person Queen Marie Amelie sent for\r\nafter her accession. She went in the evening, and found the Queen\r\nsitting at a table with Madame Adelaïde and one other lady, the wife of\r\nthe Swedish Minister. A place was given to her between the Queen and\r\nMadame Adelaïde. The first words of the Queen seemed ominous--‘Nous\r\navons laissé notre bonheur à Neuilly, Madame Hamilton.’ But Madame\r\nAdelaïde instantly took up the conversation, and talked of a bullet\r\nwhich she had found in her mirror, saying that she should never have the\r\nmirror mended, but should preserve it as ‘un souvenir historique.’\r\n\r\n“Lady Waterford says how much brighter and happier people are for having\r\nsomething young about them,--a young lady, a child, a young dog even.\r\nShe says, ‘I want to make a picture of Hope painting the future in the\r\nbrightest colours. It will be such a beautiful subject. A rainbow will\r\npour into the room and all its colours be reflected on her palette.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 20._--Lady Waterford and the Ellices went to Broadlands, and\r\nreturned in the evening radiant, and full of the Conference, with which\r\nthey were delighted. I was very sorry indeed to be too ill to go, these\r\nBroadland ‘Conferences’ being quite a type of the times.\r\n\r\n“They had a delightful drive through the forest and halted at Lyndhurst,\r\nvisiting the ‘King’s House’ and seeing the stirrup which is said to have\r\nbelonged to William Rufus. It is of gigantic size, and was probably\r\nreally intended, when dogs were forbidden in the forest, as a sort of\r\nstandard of measurement, only dogs which could pass through that stirrup\r\nbeing allowed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GARDEN PORCH, HIGHCLIFFE.][183]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SUNDIAL WALK, HIGHCLIFFE.][184]\r\n\r\n“At Broadlands, after luncheon, they went out on the lawn, where the\r\nConference was proceeding under some fine beech-trees. ‘It was like a\r\nClaude,’ said Lady Waterford, the view being over the water, with a\r\ntemple on one side and a cypress cutting the sky.’ Mr. Cowper Temple\r\nopened the afternoon meeting with a little speech; a Nonconformist\r\nminister followed, and then the High Church Mr. Wilkinson gave an\r\naddress. The most remarkable thing he told was a story of a young lady\r\nwho went to a meeting and returned resolved to dedicate herself to God.\r\nShe wrote down her dedication, and then said, ‘It shall be from to-day.’\r\nThen she considered that there was so much to be done, &c.--‘It shall be\r\nin three years.’ Again she hesitated and altered what she had\r\nwritten--‘I may not live: it shall be to-night.” But finally she thought\r\nagain how much there was she wanted to do first, and finally wrote--‘In\r\nthree weeks I will dedicate myself to God.’ In the morning the paper\r\nwas found with all the different erasures and alterations, but the young\r\nlady was dead.... Several other speakers followed, and then Mr. Cowper\r\nTemple knelt on the gravel and prayed: all was most simple and earnest.\r\n\r\n“Here at Highcliffe we have sat in the library in the morning, the great\r\nBrugmantia bursting into its bloom of scarlet bells in the conservatory\r\nbeyond, Lady Waterford painting at her table, the rest working beneath\r\nthe stained window.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Heckfield Place, August 13._--This is a beautiful open country with\r\nlovely woods and purple heaths studded with groups of fine old firs. The\r\ngrounds of Heckfield itself are delightful, and the house, of red brick,\r\nstands upon a high bastioned terrace filled with brilliant flower-beds\r\nand overlooking undulating green lawns and an artificial sheet of water.\r\n\r\n“Lord Eversley and his daughter Emma received me with most cordial\r\nkindness and a real family welcome, and it was pleasant to see so many\r\ninteresting pictures of our common ancestors,--on the staircase a\r\nfull-length of my great-grandmother Mrs. Hare, as a young girl tripping\r\nalong with her apron full of flowers. There are fine portraits of her\r\nfather and mother; and her sister, Helena Lefevre, is represented again\r\nand again, from youth to age.\r\n\r\n“Lord and Lady Selborne have been here. He has a stiff manner, but warms\r\ninto much pleasantness, and she is very genial: their daughter, Sophy,\r\nis a union of both. I went with Lord Selborne and Miss Palmer to\r\nStrathfieldsaye. The Duke (of Wellington), dressed like a poor\r\npensioner, received us in his uncomfortable room, where Lord Selborne,\r\nwho has a numismatical mania, was glad to stay for two hours examining\r\ncoins. Meanwhile the Duke, finding we were really interested, took Miss\r\nPalmer and me upstairs, and showed us all his relics. It was touching to\r\nsee the old man, who for the greater part of his lifetime existed in\r\nunloving awe of a father he had always feared and been little noticed\r\nby, now, in the evening of life, treasuring up every reminiscence of him\r\nand considering every memorial as sacred. In his close stuffy little\r\nroom were the last pheasants the great Duke had shot, the miniatures of\r\nhis mother and aunt and of himself and his brother as children, his\r\ngrandfather’s portrait, a good one of Marshal Saxe, and the picture of\r\nthe horse Copenhagen. Most of the bedrooms were completely covered with\r\nprints pasted on the walls. It was the great Duke’s fancy. Some of them\r\nare amusing, but the general effect is poor and bad, and the medley\r\ncurious, especially in some rooms where they were framed in crowds--Lord\r\nEldon, Melancthon, and views of the Alhambra together. In the hall hung\r\na fine beginning of a picture of the great Duke, painted by Goya at\r\nMadrid. Before it was finished the army had moved on to Salamanca. The\r\nDuke had then been made Captain-General of the forces, and upon the\r\nSpanish commander saying in a huff, ‘I will not serve under a\r\nforeigner,’ Goya rejoined, ‘And I will not finish his portrait.’ And he\r\nnever did.\r\n\r\n“Strathfieldsaye is an unprepossessing house--as the Duke himself said,\r\n‘like a great cottage.’\r\n\r\n“Lord Eversley gave, as a curious instance of the awe in which the great\r\nDuke kept his Duchess, that Mrs. Lefevre, going one day to visit her,\r\nfound her dissolved in tears. When she asked the reason, the Duchess\r\nsaid, sobbing, ‘Look there,’ and from the window Mrs. Lefevre saw\r\nworkmen cutting down all the ivy which made the whole beauty of the\r\ntrees before the house; and when Mrs. Lefevre asked the Duchess why she\r\ndid not remonstrate, she showed her a written paper which the head man\r\nhad just brought in, having received it from the Duke--‘Field Marshal\r\nthe Duke of Wellington desires that the ivy may immediately be cut down\r\nfrom every tree on his estate.’ They had begun with those nearest home;\r\nthe Duke had evidently forgotten to except those, but his order could\r\nnot be trifled with.\r\n\r\n“One day the great Duke was much surprised by receiving a letter which\r\nhe read as follows:--‘Being in the neighbourhood, I venture to ask\r\npermission to see some of your Grace’s best breeches. C. London.’ He\r\nanswered to the Bishop of London that he had great pleasure in assenting\r\nto his request, though he must confess it had given him very\r\nconsiderable surprise. London House was thrown into confusion. The note\r\nwas from Loudon, the great gardener, and ‘breeches’ should have been\r\nread ‘beeches.’[185]\r\n\r\n“We went on to Silchester, which is one of the three walled Roman towns\r\nof England, Wroxeter and Risborough being the others. The walls, three\r\nmiles in circumference, are nearly perfect. In the centre is the forum,\r\nan immense square, 315 feet by 276, surrounded by shops, amongst which\r\nthose of the oyster-monger, game-seller, butcher, and jeweller have been\r\nidentified. One house retains its curious apparatus for warming very\r\nperfect.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Heckfield, August 14._--Yesterday Colonel Townley came to dine,\r\ncelebrated for his ride of eight hundred miles without stopping. It was\r\nof great importance that certain despatches from our Government should\r\nreach Constantinople before the Austrian messenger could deliver his,\r\nand Colonel Townley accomplished it. When within a few hours of\r\nConstantinople, an old wound opened from his exertion, and he felt\r\nalmost dying; but just then he caught sight of the Austrian envoy coming\r\nover the brow of a distant hill, and it nerved him, and he rode on and\r\narrived first. It gained him his colonelcy.

He\r\nwas a Cambridge friend of my uncle Julius Hare, and lived in the same\r\ncircle, of Thirlwall, Whewell, Sedgwick, and the Malcolms, &c. His mind\r\nhas all its old power, and he has much that is most interesting to tell\r\nof all the people he has seen. He gave a curious account of breakfasts\r\nat the house of Ugo Foscolo, where everything was served by the most\r\nbeautiful maidens in picturesque dresses. He described the eccentric Mr.\r\nPeate, who lived in Trinity, but never came out of his rooms except to\r\ndinner or supper, when he always appeared to the moment. When Dr. Parr\r\ndined, Mr. Peate drew him out in Combination Room, but retired at the\r\nusual hour; only on going away, he walked up to Dr. Parr and said, ‘I\r\nwill take leave of you, sir, in words which may possibly not be\r\nunfamiliar to you,’ and made a long set complimentary speech in honour\r\nof learning; it was all taken word for word from an essay Dr. Parr had\r\npublished many years before; Peate’s memory was so very extraordinary.\r\nIt was not, however, always very convenient, for if a neighbour at\r\ndinner affirmed an opinion, Peate would sometimes say, ‘On such a day or\r\nsuch a year you expressed such and such an opinion, which was exactly\r\nthe reverse of this,’ for he never forgot anything, even the very terms\r\nof an expression.\r\n\r\n“There is here in Salisbury the usual familiar society of a cathedral\r\nclose--the Canon in residence and the other inhabitants meeting and\r\ngoing in and out of each others’ houses at all hours. With Canon Douglas\r\nGordon I have been to the Palace, where we found the Bishop in his\r\ngarden, which is quite lovely, the rich green and brilliant flowers\r\nsweeping up into and mingling with the grey arcades and rich chapels of\r\nthe cathedral; and from all points the tall heaven-soaring spire is\r\nsublime, especially in the purple shadows of evening, with birds\r\ncircling ceaselessly round it.\r\n\r\n“The Palace has a grand dull room full of portraits of deceased bishops,\r\nwhere we had tea. Bishop Moberly, who is still rather schoolmasterish,\r\nhas no end of daughters, all so excellent that it has been observed\r\nthat whenever a colonist sends home for a commendable wife, you may,\r\nwith the most perfect confidence, despatch a Miss Moberly.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 16._--To Breamore, the fine old Elizabethan house of Sir Edward\r\nHulse, almost gutted by fire some years ago. I was taken up to the\r\nhousetop to survey several surrounding counties, and sat the rest of the\r\nafternoon with the family in the shade of the old red gables. Two very\r\nhandsome boys, Edward and Westrow, asked for a story.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Stanmer Park, August 18._--I came here yesterday to Lord Chichester’s.\r\nIt is a moderate house in a dullish park, with fine trees and a bright\r\nflower-garden. We pray a great deal, and Lord Chichester--who is\r\nintensely good--makes little sermons at prayers.... Lord Pelham is very\r\namusing under a quiet manner. ‘I thought I heard your dulcet tones, my\r\nlove, so I am coming out to you,’ he is just saying, as he steps through\r\nthe open window to his wife upon the verandah.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 4._--A most charming visit to Lady Mary Egerton at Mountfield\r\nCourt. Mr. Charles Newton[186] of the British Museum is here, who is\r\nalways charming, with ripple of pleasantest anecdote and kindly, genial\r\nmanners. He says:--\r\n\r\n“General Skenk had a monkey and a parrot, which hated each other. One\r\nday he imprudently went out, leaving them alone together in a room. When\r\nhe came back, the monkey was sitting in his arm-chair, bleeding\r\nprofusely, and looking very sheepish and ashamed of himself, while the\r\nfloor was covered with feathers. The parrot had disappeared, but while\r\nGeneral Skenk was looking for any further remains of it, out from under\r\na sofa walked a perfectly naked bird, and said, ‘What a hell of a time\r\nwe’ve had!’\r\n\r\n“Mr. Newton was at a spiritual séance. An old man of the party was told\r\nthat the spirit manifested was his wife, upon which he said:--\r\n\r\n“‘Is that you, ’Arriet?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, it’s me.’\r\n\r\n“‘Are you ’appy, ’Arriet?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, very ‘appy.’\r\n\r\n“‘’Appier than you were with me, ’Arriet?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, much ‘appier.’\r\n\r\n“‘Where are you, ‘’Arriet?’\r\n\r\n“‘In ‘ell.’\r\n\r\n“Mr. Newton says that the cry of the wood-pigeon is ‘Sow peas, do, do.’\r\nThere is a bird in Turkey of which the male seems to say a string of\r\nwords meaning ‘Have you seen my sheep?’ when the female replies, ‘No, I\r\nhave not seen them.’ They are said to be a shepherd and shepherdess who\r\nlost all their sheep and died of a broken heart, when they were turned\r\ninto birds. But the interesting point is that the story is found in an\r\nold Greek novel--‘Longus.’\r\n\r\n“‘The origin of the Torlonia family,’ said Mr. Newton, ‘is very curious.\r\nWhen Pius VII. wished to excommunicate Napoleon I., he could not find\r\nany one who was bold enough to affix the _scomunica_ to the doors of the\r\nLateran. At length an old man who sold matches was found who ran the\r\nrisk and did it. On the return of the Pope in triumph, the old man was\r\noffered any favour he liked, and he chose the monopoly of tobacco. From\r\nthat time every speculation that the Torlonias entered upon was sure to\r\nanswer.’\r\n\r\n“The late Prince Torlonia, being at Naples, went into the room where the\r\npublic appointments were sold by auction. He left his umbrella there,\r\nand went back to get it while the sale was going on. The bidders,\r\nchiefly Neapolitan nobles, were aghast to see the great Torlonia\r\nreappear, and at last, after some consultation, one of them came up to\r\nhim and said they would give him 60,000 francs if he would leave.\r\nInstead of showing the intense astonishment he felt at this most\r\nunexpected proposal, Torlonia only shrugged his shoulders and said, ‘È\r\npóco,’ and they gave him 100,000.\r\n\r\n“The only other guests at Mountfield are a Mr. Baker, a Gloucestershire\r\nsquire, and his wife. He is an excellent man, and was the first who\r\ninstituted a Reformatory. This he did first at his own expense, but the\r\nGovernment bought it from him. He speaks with the most dreary voice. Mr.\r\nNewton says it is ‘just the sort of utterance he should be grateful for\r\nif he was making his last speech upon the scaffold.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sonning, Dec. 30._--My ever-kind friend Lord Stanhope died on\r\nChristmas Eve. It was only two years from the time of dear Lady\r\nStanhope’s death, on New Year’s Eve, 1873. She left a paper for her\r\nhusband--what she called her ‘Last Words’--imploring him, for her sake,\r\nto go back to his literary interests, not to give up what had been his\r\nwork, to try to fill up the blank in his life.\r\n\r\n“When Lord Stanhope was dying, he said touchingly to Lady Mohun, ‘You\r\nknow what my dearest Emily asked of me in her last words. I have tried\r\nto do as she wished, and you, my dear, have been such a good and kind\r\ndaughter to me, _you have almost made me wish to live_.’\r\n\r\n“I have been spending charming days with Hugh Pearson. He says, ‘What\r\nwill become of a country in which the upper classes are content to be\r\nfed upon Farrar’s ‘Life of Christ’ and the middle classes upon Moody and\r\nSankey?’ He told me of Justice Knight Bruce’s capital lines--\r\n\r\n    ‘The ladies praise our curate’s eyes;\r\n       I cannot see their light divine:\r\n     He always shuts them when he prays,\r\n       And, when he preaches, closes mine.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nLONDON WALKS AND SOCIETY\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“It is an inexpressible pleasure to know a little of the world, and to\r\nbe of no character or significancy in it.”--STEELE.\r\n\r\n    “Arranging long-locked drawers and shelves\r\n       Of cabinets, shut up for years,\r\n     What a strange task we’ve set ourselves!\r\n       How still the lonely room appears!\r\n     How strange this mass of ancient treasures,\r\n     Mementos of past pains and pleasures.”\r\n\r\n    “Be wisely worldly, be not worldly wise.”--QUARLES.\r\n\r\n    “No, when the fight begins within himself,\r\n     A man’s worth something.”--BROWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy three thick volumes of the “Cities of Northern and Central Italy”\r\nappeared in the autumn of 1875, a very large edition (3000 copies) being\r\nprinted at once. They were immediately the object of a most violent\r\nattack from Mr. Murray, who saw in them rivals to his well-known red\r\nhandbooks. A most virulent and abusive article appeared upon my work in\r\nthe _Athenæum_, accusing me, amongst other things, of having copied\r\nfrom Murray’s Handbooks without acknowledgment, and quoting, as proof,\r\npassages relating to Verona in both books, which have the same singular\r\nmistake. It was certainly a curious accident which made me receive the\r\nproof-sheets of Verona when away from home on a visit at Tunbridge\r\nWells, where the only book of reference accessible was Murray’s\r\n“Handbook of Northern Italy,” which I found in the house, so that the\r\nmistakes in my account of Verona _were_ actually copied from Murray’s\r\nHandbook, to which I was indebted for nothing else whatever, as (though\r\nmuch delighted with them when they first appeared) I had for years found\r\nMurray’s Handbooks so inefficient, that I had never bought or made any\r\nuse of them, preferring the accurate and intelligent Handbooks of the\r\nGerman _Gsel-fels_. Mr. Murray further took legal proceedings against\r\nme, because in one of my volumes I had mentioned that the Italian Lakes\r\nwere included in his Swiss rather than his Italian Handbooks: this\r\nhaving been altered in recent years, but having been the case in the\r\nonly volumes of his Handbooks I had ever possessed. On all occasions,\r\nany little literary success I met with excited bitter animosity from Mr.\r\nMurray.\r\n\r\nAnother curious attack was made upon me by the eccentric Mr. Freeman,\r\nthe historian of the Norman Conquest. He had published in the _Saturday\r\nReview_ a series of short articles on the Italian cities, which I always\r\nfelt had never received the attention they deserved, their real interest\r\nhaving been overlooked owing to the unpopularity of the dogmatic and\r\nverbose style in which they were written. Therefore, really with the\r\nidea of doing Mr. Freeman a good turn, I had rather gone out of my way\r\nto introduce extracts from his articles where I could, that notice might\r\nthus be attracted to them--an attention for which I had already been\r\nthanked by other little-read authors, as, whatever may be the many\r\nfaults of my books, they have always had a large circulation. But in the\r\ncase of Mr. Freeman, knowing the singular character of the man, I begged\r\na common friend to write to his daughter and amanuensis to mention my\r\nintention, and ask her, if her father had no objection to my quoting\r\nfrom his articles, to send me a list of them (as they were unsigned), in\r\norder that I might not confuse them with those of any other person. By\r\nreturn of post I received, without comment, from Miss Freeman, a list of\r\nher father’s articles, and I naturally considered this as equivalent to\r\nhis full permission to quote from them. I was therefore greatly\r\nsurprised, when Mr. Freeman’s articles appeared soon afterwards in a\r\nsmall volume, to find it introduced with a preface, the whole object of\r\nwhich was, in the most violent manner, to accuse me of theft. I\r\nimmediately published a full statement of the circumstances under which\r\nI had quoted from Mr. Freeman in sixteen different newspapers. Mr.\r\nFreeman answered in the _Times_ by repeating his accusation, and in the\r\n_Guardian_ he added, “Though Mr. Hare’s conduct was barefaced and\r\nwholesale robbery, I shall take no further notice of him till he has\r\nstolen something else.”[187]\r\n\r\nMr. Freeman made himself many enemies, but he did not make me one; he\r\nwas too odd. His neighbour, the Dean of Wells, Johnson, could not bear\r\nhim. When there was an Archæological Meeting at Wells, it was thought\r\nthat peace might be made if the Dean could be persuaded to propose the\r\nhistorian’s health at the dinner. The Dean was quite willing, but he\r\nbegan his speech unfortunately with--“I rise with great pleasure to\r\npropose the health of our eminent neighbour, Mr. Freeman the historian,\r\na man who--in his own personal characteristics--has so often depicted\r\nfor us the savage character of our first forefathers.”\r\n\r\nBut in spite of these little catastrophes attending its publication, I\r\nam certain that “Cities of Northern and Central Italy,” which cost me\r\nfar more pains and labour, and which is more entirely original, than all\r\nmy earlier books put together, was by far the best of my writings, up to\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nBefore the book was out, I was already devoted to a new work, suggested\r\nby the great delight I had long found in London, and by the desire of\r\nawakening others to an enjoyment of its little-known treasures. A set of\r\nlectures delivered at Sir John Shaw-Lefevre’s house in Seymour Street,\r\nand a series of articles in _Good Words_, laid the foundation for my\r\n“Walks in London.” When employed in this work, as in all my others, I\r\nfelt all those portions of life to be the most interesting which were\r\nspent in following out any one single purpose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 18, 1876._--I went to Cobham for three days last week. Deep snow\r\nwas on the ground, but the visit was delightful. I was delighted to find\r\nLady Pelham there, always so radiant and cordial, and so perfectly\r\nsimple. Of the other guests, the most interesting were Lord and Lady\r\nHarris. There were also a great many Kentish men, hunting clergy, who\r\ndressed in top-boots, &c., _during_ their visit, but departed in\r\necclesiastical attire.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 19._--Yesterday I went to Lady Taunton. She has a beautiful\r\nportrait of her daughter by young Richmond--a sort of play upon every\r\npossible tone of yellow--a yellow gown, a yellow background, a great\r\ncushion worked with yellow sunflowers, yellow hair looped up with\r\npearls, only a great white living lily to throw it all back. It is a\r\nmost poetical picture.\r\n\r\n“In the evening I went to a supper at the house of young F. P. to meet a\r\nwhole society of young actors, artists, &c. Eden was there, known in the\r\nstage world as Herbert, a name he took to save the feelings of his\r\nepiscopal uncle, Lord Auckland. His is a fine and a charming face, but\r\nrather sad.... There were about fourteen men present, very good singing,\r\nand then supper, much kindness and cordiality, and not a word which all\r\ntheir mothers and sisters might not have heard. It would not have been\r\nso at college or in a mess-room: so much for maligned actors.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 21._--To see Frederick Walker’s pictures. It is an interesting\r\ncollection, as being the written mind of one man. You see the same\r\npicture over and over again, from its first sketch of an idea--merely a\r\nfloating idea--to its entire completion, and it is interesting to know\r\nhow slow a growth of thought was required to lead up to something,\r\nwhich, after all, was not so very wonderful in the end. The pictures are\r\nnot beautiful, but the man who did them must have been charming, such a\r\nsimple lover of farmhouse life, apple-orchards, and old-fashioned\r\ngardens, with a glory of flowers--all the right kinds of flowers\r\nblooming together.\r\n\r\n“It poured, so I sat some time with R. on one of the seats. He talked\r\nlong and openly of all the temptations of his life, and endlessly about\r\nhimself. I urged that the best way of ennobling his own nature must be\r\nthrough others, that self-introspection would never do, and could only\r\nlead to egotism and selfishness, but that in trying to help others he\r\nwould unconsciously help himself. I find it most difficult to say\r\nanything of this kind without making illustrations out of my own life,\r\nwhich I have certainly no right to think exemplary.\r\n\r\n“As we were going away, a lady who had stared long and hard at us, and\r\nwhom I thought to be some waif turned up from my Roman lectures, came up\r\nto me. ‘I think, sir, that you were standing close to my sister just\r\nnow, and she has lost her purse.’--‘I am very sorry your sister has lost\r\nher purse; it is very unfortunate.’--‘Yes, but my sister has _lost_ her\r\npurse, and you, _you_ were standing by her when she lost it.’--‘I think\r\nafter what you have said I had better give you my card.’--‘Oh, no, no,\r\nno.’--’ Oh, yes, yes, yes: after what you have said I must _insist_ upon\r\ngiving you my card.’ What an odd experience, to be taken for a\r\npickpocket! R. thought the lady had really picked _my_ pocket, but she\r\nhad not.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 22._--An anonymous letter of apology from the lady of the picked\r\npocket; only she said that if I had been as flurried as she was, and had\r\nbeen placed in the same circumstances as she was, I should have acted\r\nexactly as she did; in which I do not quite agree with her.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Monk’s Orchard, Jan. 23._--This is a fine big house, be-pictured,\r\nbe-statued, with a terraced garden, a lake, and a great flat park. A Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Rodd are here with their son Rennell, a pleasant-looking boy,\r\nwonderfully precocious and clever, though, as every one listens to him,\r\nhe has--not unnaturally--a very good opinion of himself: still one feels\r\nat once that he is the sort of boy who will be heard of again some day.\r\n\r\n“Our host, Mr. Lewis Loyd, is in some ways one of the most absent men in\r\nthe world. One day, meeting a friend, he said, ‘Hallo! what a long time\r\nit is since I’ve seen you! How’s your father?’--‘Oh, my father’s\r\ndead.’--‘God bless me! I’m very sorry,’ &c. The next year he met the\r\nsame man again, and had forgotten all about it, so began with, ‘Hallo!\r\nwhat a long time since I’ve seen you! How’s your father?’-‘Oh, _my\r\nfather’s dead still_!’\r\n\r\n“We have been to church at Shirley--one of Scott’s new country churches.\r\nIn the churchyard is a cross to poor Sir John Anson, and beside it a\r\ngranite altar-tomb with an inscription saying that it is to Ruskin’s\r\nfather--‘a perfectly honest merchant,’ and that ‘his son, whom he loved\r\nto the uttermost, and taught to speak the truth, says this.’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_69 Onslow Square, Jan. 28._--A long visit to F. and S. It is quite a\r\nnew phase of life to me. They are perfect gentlemen, at least in heart,\r\nand one cannot be with them long without seeing a kindly, chivalrous\r\nnature, which comes to the surface in a thousand little nothings. Yet\r\nthey are what the world frowns upon--beginning to seek fortune on the\r\nstage, neglected or rejected by unsympathetic relations, living from\r\nhand to mouth, furnishing their rooms by pawning their rings and\r\nwatches, &c. S. in terrible illness, totally penniless, ignored by every\r\none, is taken in, nursed, doctored, and paid for by F., upon whom he has\r\nno claim whatever. F., abused, snubbed, and without any natural charm in\r\nhimself, is henceforth loved, defended, regarded with the most loyal\r\ndevotion, by his more popular companion.\r\n\r\n“I dined on the 26th with Lady E. Adeane. Mr. Percy Doyle was very\r\namusing. Talking of the anxiety of ministers in America to change their\r\nposts, he said, ‘If my father had bequeathed to me Hell and Texas, I\r\nshould have lived in Hell and let Texas.’\r\n\r\n“Yesterday I went to luncheon with the Vaughans at the Temple, and met\r\nthere Miss Rye, who has a home for homeless children at Clapham, and\r\ntakes them off by batches to America, to establish them there as\r\nservants, &c. She produced from her pocket about a hundred\r\ncartes-de-visite of the children, wild, unkempt, and wicked-looking, and\r\nof the same children after they had been under cultivation. Certainly\r\nthe change was marvellous, but then she had employed a good photographer\r\nfor the redeemed children and a very bad one for the little ruffians.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOUNTAIN COURT, TEMPLE.][188]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 5._--Dined at Lady Sarah Lindsay’s. Sir Robert Phillimore was\r\nthere, whom I had not seen since I was a child. He is most agreeable\r\nand has a noble nature. There was a young man there, a Bridgeman, just\r\nentering the law, and I thought the picture quite beautiful which Sir\r\nRobert drew without effort for his encouragement, of all that the\r\nprofession of the law might become and be made by any one who really\r\ntook to it,--of all the great aims to be fulfilled, of all the ways of\r\nmaking it useful to others and ennobling to one’s own nature. I felt so\r\nmuch all that I should have felt that sort of encouragement, drawn from\r\npractical experience, would have been to myself.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 8._--The opening of Parliament.

At a\r\nquarter to two the procession passed beneath--the fine old carriages and\r\ngorgeous footmen, one stream of gold and red, pouring through the black\r\ncrowd and leafless trees. We all counted the carriages\r\ndifferently--eight, twelve, fifteen; and there were only six! All one\r\nsaw of royalty was the waving of a white cap-string, as the Queen,\r\nsitting well back in the carriage, bowed to the people.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 13._--Dined at the Dowager Lady Barrington’s--the great topic\r\nbeing dinner past, present, and prospective. George, Lord Barrington,\r\nsaid that he had dined at the Brazilian Minister’s, and he was sure the\r\ncookery was good and also the wine, for he had eaten of every dish and\r\ndrunk fourteen kinds of wine, and had passed a perfectly good night and\r\nbeen quite well the next morning. He also dined with Mr. Brand the\r\nSpeaker, and complimented Mrs. Brand upon the dinner. She told her cook.\r\nHe said, ‘We are three, Lord Granville’s, Mr. Russell Sturgis’s, and\r\nmyself; there are only three cooks in London.’ When Lord Harrington\r\nafterwards saw Mrs. Brand, she told him the cook had asked who had\r\npraised him, and ‘when he heard,’ continued Mrs. Brand, ‘he also gave\r\nyou his little meed of praise.’ ‘Ah, M. Barrington,’ he said, ‘c’est une\r\nbonne fourchette.’ He had been at Kinmel, but said he had ‘dismissed Mr.\r\nHughes.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 14._--Dined at Lord Halifax’s to meet Lord and Lady Cardwell.\r\nThey are most pleasant, interesting, interested company, and it was\r\naltogether one of the happiest dinners I remember. The conversation was\r\nchiefly about the changes in spelling and their connection with changes\r\nin English history and customs.\r\n\r\n“Lord Cardwell was in the habit of using the Church prayers at family\r\nprayers. One day his valet came to him and said, ‘I must leave your\r\nlordship’s service at once.’--‘Why, what have you to complain\r\nof?’--‘Nothing personally, but your lordship _will_ repeat every\r\nmorning--“We have done those things which we ought not to have done, and\r\nhave left undone those things which we ought to have done:”--now I\r\nfreely admit that I have often done things I ought not, but that I have\r\nleft undone things that I ought to have done, I utterly deny: and I will\r\nnot stay here to hear it said.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 19._--A charming walk with Charlie Wood to St. Paul’s, along the\r\nEmbankment and then a labyrinth of quaint City streets. He called it his\r\nhalf-holiday, and I am sure it was so to me to mount into his pure\r\nunworldly atmosphere even for two hours. He is really the only young man\r\nI know who at once thinks no evil, believes no evil, and does no evil.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sunday, Feb. 20._--Luncheon with Mrs. Harvey of Ickwellbury, meeting\r\nColonel Taylor, the Whip of the House of Commons--a very amusing man. He\r\ntalked a great deal about Ireland. He said that when he congratulated\r\nWhyte-Melville upon the engagement of his daughter to Lord Massereene,\r\nhe said, ‘Yes, I have every reason to be satisfied: first, my future\r\nson-in-law is an Irishman, and then he speaks his native tongue in all\r\nits purity.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN FRONT OF ST. PAUL’S.][189]\r\n\r\n“He spoke of landing in former days at Kingstown, how the car-drivers\r\nfought for you, and, having obtained you, possessed you, and made all\r\nout of you that they could. Passing a mile-post with G. P. O. upon it,\r\nthe ‘fare’ asked its meaning. ‘Why, your honour,’ said the driver, ‘it’s\r\naizy to see that your honour has never been in ould Ireland before--why,\r\nthat’s just God preserve O’Connell, your honour, and it’s on ivery\r\nmile-post all through the country.’ It was of course ‘General Post\r\nOffice.’\r\n\r\n“Coming to a river, the ‘fare’ asked, ‘What do you call this\r\nriver?’--‘It’s not a river at all, your honour; it’s only a\r\nstrame.’--‘Well, but what do you call it?’--‘Oh, we don’t call it at\r\nall, your honour; it just comes of itself.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 24._--Dined at Lord Strathmore’s, and went on with Hedworth and\r\nLizzie Williamson to Lady Bloomfield’s, where sixty-eight cousins\r\nassembled to take leave of Lord and Lady Lytton on their departure for\r\nIndia.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf any one has ever the patience to read this memoir through, they will\r\nhave been struck by the way in which, for many years before the time I\r\nam writing of, the persons with whom I lived were quite different from\r\nthose amongst whom my childhood was spent. Arthur Stanley had never got\r\nover the publication of the “Memorials of a Quiet Life,” though he was\r\nalways at a loss to say what he objected to in it, and Mary Stanley I\r\nnever saw at all. From Lady Augusta alone I continued to receive\r\nfrequent and affectionate messages.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 Lady Augusta represented the Queen at the marriage of the Duke\r\nof Edinburgh, and she never really recovered the effects of the cold\r\nwhich she then endured in Russia. In the summer of 1875 she was\r\nalarmingly ill in Paris, was brought home with difficulty, and from that\r\ntime there was little hope of her recovery. She expired early in March\r\n1876. I had not seen her for long, but had always a most affectionate\r\nrecollection of her, and the last letter she was able to dictate was\r\naddressed to me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, March 12._--I have been again up to London for dear Augusta\r\nStanley’s funeral on the 9th. It was a beautiful day. All the approaches\r\nto Westminster were filled with people in mourning.\r\n\r\n“It seemed most strange thus to go to the Deanery again--that the doors\r\nclosed for six years were opened wide by death, by the death of one who\r\nhad always remained my friend, and whom no efforts of others could\r\nalienate. Red cloth showed that royalty was coming, and I went at once\r\nto the library, where an immense crowd of cousins were assembled. As I\r\nwent down the little staircase with Kate Vaughan, four ladies in deep\r\nmourning passed to the dining-room, carrying immense wreaths of lovely\r\nwhite flowers: they were the Queen and three of her daughters. The Queen\r\nseemed in a perfect anguish of grief. She remained for a short time\r\nalone with the coffin, I believe knelt by it, and was then taken to the\r\ngallery overhanging the Abbey.\r\n\r\n“Soon the immense procession set out by the cloisters, and on entering\r\nthe church, turned so as to pass beneath the Queen and then up the nave\r\nfrom the west end. The church was full of people: I felt as if I only\r\nsaw the wind lifting the long garlands of white flowers as the coffin\r\nmoved slowly on, and Arthur’s pathetic face of childlike bewilderment.\r\nThe music was lovely, but in that vast choir one longed for a village\r\nservice. It was not so in the second part, when we moved through one\r\nlong sob from the poor of Westminster who lined the way, to the little\r\nchapel behind the tomb of Henry VII., where the service was\r\nindescribably simple and touching.\r\n\r\n“The procession of mourners went round the Abbey from the choir by a\r\nlonger way to the chapel on account of the people. As it passed the\r\ncorner of the transept, the strange little figure of Mr. Carlyle slipped\r\nout. He had been very fond of Augusta, was full of feeling for Arthur,\r\nand seemed quite unconscious of who and where he was. He ran along,\r\nbefore the chief mourners, by the side of the coffin, and in the chapel\r\nitself he stood at the head of the grave, making the strangest\r\nejaculations at intervals through the service.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArthur stood at the head of the grave with his hands on the heads of\r\nThomas Bruce’s two children. When the last flowers fell into the grave,\r\na single voice sang gloriously, “Write, saith the Spirit.” Then we moved\r\nback again to the nave, and, standing at the end, in a voice of most\r\nmajestic pathos, quivering, yet audible through all that vast space,\r\nArthur himself gave the blessing. “The Queen was waiting for him upon\r\nthe threshold as he went into the house, and led him herself into his\r\ndesolate home.”\r\n\r\nI insert some poor lines which I wrote “In Memoriam.”\r\n\r\n    “Lately together in a common grief\r\n       Our Royal mistress with her people wept,\r\n     And reverently were fairest garlands laid\r\n       Where our beloved one from her sufferings slept.\r\n\r\n     Seeing the sunshine through a mist of tears\r\n       Fall on the bier of her we loved so well,\r\n     Each, in the memory sweet of happy years,\r\n       Some kindly word or kindlier thought could tell.\r\n\r\n     And tenderly, with sorrow-trembling voice,\r\n       All sought their comfort in a meed of love,\r\n     Unworthy echoes from each saddened heart\r\n       Seeking their share in the great loss to prove.\r\n\r\n     For she so lately gathered into rest\r\n       Was one who smoothed this stony path of ours,\r\n     And beating down the thorns along the way,\r\n       Aye left it strewn and sweet with summer flowers.\r\n\r\n     In the true candour of a noble heart,\r\n       She never sought another’s fault to show,\r\n     But rather thought there must be in herself\r\n       Some secret failure which she did not know.\r\n\r\n     While if all praised and honoured, she herself\r\n       Meekly received it with a sweet surprise,\r\n     Seeking henceforth to be what now she deemed\r\n       Was but a phantasy in loving eyes.\r\n\r\n     When the fair sunshine of her happy home\r\n       Tuned her whole heart and all her life to praise,\r\n     She ever tried to cheer some gloomier lot,\r\n       From the abounding brightness of its ways.\r\n\r\n     And many a weary sufferer blest the hand\r\n       Which knew so well a healing balm to pour;\r\n     While hungry voices never were denied\r\n       By her, who kept, as steward, a poor man’s store.\r\n\r\n     Thus when, from all the labour of her love,\r\n       She passed so sadly to a bed of pain,\r\n     And when from tongue to tongue the story went,\r\n       That none would see the honoured face again:\r\n\r\n     It was a personal grief to thousand hearts\r\n       Outside the sphere in which her lot was cast,\r\n     And tens of thousands sought to have a share\r\n       In loving honour paid her at the last.\r\n\r\n     E’en death is powerless o’er a life like hers,\r\n       Its radiance lingers, though its sun has set;\r\n     Rich and unstinted was the seed she sowed,\r\n       The golden harvest is not gathered yet.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_March 25._--A ‘Spelling Bee’ at Mrs. Dundas’s. I was plucked as I\r\nentered the room over the word Camelopard.\r\n\r\n“Dined at the Tower of London with Everard Primrose; only young Lord\r\nMayo there. At 11 P.M. the old ceremony of relieving guard took place. I\r\nstood with Everard and a file of soldiers on a little raised terrace. A\r\nfigure with a lanthorn emerged from a dark hole.\r\n\r\n“‘Who goes there?’ shouted the soldiers.\r\n\r\n“‘The Queen.’\r\n\r\n“‘What Queen?’\r\n\r\n“‘Queen Victoria.’\r\n\r\n“‘And whose keys are those?’\r\n\r\n“‘Queen Victoria’s keys.’\r\n\r\n“Upon which the figure, advancing into the broad moonlight, said ‘God\r\nbless Queen Victoria!’ and all the soldiers shouted ‘Amen’ and\r\ndispersed.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 28._--My lecture on ‘The Strand and the Inns of Court’ took\r\nplace in 41 Seymour Street. I felt at Tyburn till I began, and then got\r\non pretty well. There was a very large attendance. I was very much\r\nalarmed at the whole party, but had an individual dread of Lord\r\nHoughton, though I was soon relieved by seeing that he was fast asleep,\r\nand remained so all the time.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_April 4._--My lecture on Aldersgate, &c.

Dear Sir John talked much,\r\nwhen we were alone, of the great mercies and blessings of his life--how\r\nentirely he could now say with Horne Tooke, ‘I am both content and\r\nthankful.’ He described his life--his frequent qualms at having\r\nsacrificed a certain position at the bar to an uncertain post under\r\nGovernment: then how the Governorship of Ceylon was offered to him, and\r\nhow he longed to take it, but did not, though it was of all things what\r\nhe would have liked, because an instant answer was demanded, and he\r\ncould not at once find any means of providing for the children he could\r\nnot take with him: how through all the year afterwards he was very\r\nmiserable and could apply to nothing, it was such a very severe\r\ndisappointment; and then how he was persuaded to stand for Cambridge,\r\nand how, though he did not get in, the effort served its purpose in\r\ndiverting his thoughts. Eventually the place in the House of Lords was\r\noffered, in which he worked for so many years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHAPEL AND GATEWAY, LINCOLN’S INN.][193]\r\n\r\n“Sir John spoke most touchingly of his boy’s death. ‘We had another\r\nlittle boy once, you did not know perhaps. It died. It was the dearest,\r\nmost engaging child. When it died it took the shine out of life.’ Then\r\nhe dwelt on the law of compensations, how the anxiety for his eldest\r\ngirl Rachel, so very ill, ‘brought in on a cushion, and suffering so\r\nmuch, poor thing,’ diverted his thoughts from the great loss. In his old\r\nage he said, ‘And now at eighty all is blessing--_all_ ... but it is\r\ndifficult to remember how old one is. The chief sign of age I feel is\r\nthe inability to apply regularly to work, the having no desire to begin\r\nanything new.’ One could not but feel as if it was Sir Thomas More who\r\nwas speaking, so beautiful his spirit of blessed contentment, so perfect\r\nthe trust and repose of his gentle waiting for what the future might\r\nbring.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STAPLE INN, HOLBORN.][194]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, April 30._--Lea has been in saying, ‘It’s May Day\r\nto-morrow, the day to turn the cows out to grass. The poor things must\r\nhave a bit of a treat then, you know; they always have done. But there’s\r\nnot the good clover now-a-days there used to be. Eh! what a fuss there\r\nused to be, to be sure, putting the cows out in the clover; and we used\r\nto watch that they did not eat too much, and to see that they did not\r\nswell; if they did, they had to be pricked, or they’d have burst. And\r\nthen next day there was the making of the first May cheese.... Old John\r\nPearce at Lime used to take wonderful care of Mr. Taylor’s oxen, and\r\nproud enough he used to be of them. “Well, you give them plenty to eat,\r\nJohn,” I used to say. “Yes, that’s just about it, Miss Lea,” he said; “I\r\ndo put it into them right down spitefully, that I do.”’\r\n\r\n“Here are some more of her sayings:--\r\n\r\n“‘Here’s a pretty how-d’ye-do! It’s the master finding fault!--it’s one\r\nday one thing and one another. Old bachelors and old maids are all\r\nalike. They don’t know what they want, _they_ don’t; but _I_ know: the\r\nold maids want husbands, and the old bachelors want wives, that’s what\r\nthey want.’\r\n\r\n“‘It’s the mischief of the farming now-a-days that the farmers always\r\nsay ‘Go.’ ... My father used to say a farmer never ought to say ‘Go;’ if\r\nhe did, the work was sure to be neglected: a farmer should always say\r\n‘Come, lads,’ and then the work would be done.’\r\n\r\n“‘It’s hailing is it? then there’ll be frost, for\r\n\r\n    “Hail, hail,\r\n     Brings frost at its tail!”\r\n\r\nas the saying is.’\r\n\r\n“‘Why, girl, the moon’s waning.

I daresay folks laugh at me, but I\r\nknow what’s what.’\r\n\r\n“‘How you do make him (a sick young man) laugh!\r\n\r\n“‘Well, and there’s nothing does him so much good. He’d mope, mope,\r\nmope, and that’s nothing. It makes him fat, like babies. Boys must\r\nlaugh, or they won’t get fat. Girls may cry: it always does them good:\r\nit stretches their muscles and such like: but boys mustn’t cry; it’s bad\r\nfor them: that’s how the old saying goes.’\r\n\r\n“‘How do you like them?\r\n\r\n“‘Eh! how do I know? We must summer ’em and winter ’em afore we can\r\ntell, must’na we, wench: aye, and a good many summers and winters it\r\nmust be too, and then they may deceive ye.

Being told that the cell of Sir Thomas More was to be seen, and\r\nseeing a railing by the flickering torchlight, she thought that marked\r\nthe place, and went underneath it, and stepped out into--nothing! With a\r\npiercing shriek she fell into a black abyss by a precipice of fourteen\r\nfeet.

In the great Church of St. Mary Overy\r\nwe drew the wonderful figures of the ‘Sisters’--sleeping deeply with\r\ntheir rakes and prongs over their shoulders while waiting for the great\r\nfinal harvest.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAHERE’S TOMB, ST.

Lord Henry Scott talked of his place\r\non the Solent, and his different rights to flotsam, jetsam, and lagam;\r\nthat it never arrived at the third: that the second had only brought\r\nhim two dead sailors to bury.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SLEEPING SISTERS, ST. MARY OVERY.][199]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 27._--Dined at Lord Egerton of Tatton’s, Old General Doyle was\r\nvery amusing with his stories of duels in which he had a personal share.\r\nHe also told of his visit to Ireland as a young man with the present\r\nLord Enniskillen as Lord Cole. At the first house they went to, his\r\nfriend escaped after dinner, but he had not time. The host locked the\r\ndoor, and they began to drink at seven, and went on to eleven. At\r\neleven his host fell under the table, and he then picked his pocket of\r\nthe key and got out. The next day his host seriously consulted Lord Cole\r\nas to whether it was not his duty to call him out, because he would not\r\nstay for another drinking bout.\r\n\r\n“He told the story of a man in France, condemned to death for the murder\r\nof his father and mother, who, when asked if he could give any reason\r\nwhy he should not undergo the extreme penalty of the law, clasped his\r\nhands, and said, ‘Ayez pitié d’un pauvre orphelin.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 31._--An evening party at Lord Houghton’s, an omnium-gatherum, but\r\nvery amusing. It recalled Carlyle’s speech, who, when some ecclesiastic\r\ngloomily inquired in his presence ‘What would happen if Jesus Christ\r\nreturned to earth _now_?’ retorted--‘_Happen!_ why Dickie Milnes would\r\nask him to dinner, to be sure, and would ask Pontius Pilate to meet\r\nhim.’\r\n\r\n“It took half-an-hour to get up the staircase. Miss Rhoda Broughton was\r\nthere, beautifully dressed, pressed upon by bishops and clergy: Salvini\r\nand Irving were affectionately greeting: Lady Stanley of Alderley, under\r\na perfect stack of diamonds, was declaiming very loud in her unknown\r\ntongue to an astonished and bewildered audience; and through all the\r\ngroups upstairs the young King of the Belgians was smiling and bowing a\r\nretreat to his escape by a back-staircase.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 6._--Left London for Devonshire, struck more than usual with the\r\ninterest of the Great Western Railway, which has no exceptional beauty,\r\nbut most characteristic changes of scenery, even the botany along the\r\nbanks showing in its different plants the varied conformations of the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n“First, close to London, the endless brick-kilns, and the last streets\r\nstretching out into the blackened fields like fingers of a skeleton\r\nhand. Then across the green meadows, all intersected by elms, branchless\r\nand tufted like great brooms, the grey coronal of Windsor. Then the red\r\nhouses and pretentious prison of Reading and the glassy reaches of the\r\nThames, with its vigorous growth of sturdy water-plants at Pangbourne\r\nand Maple Durham.\r\n\r\n“Next we enter Berkshire, bare and featureless except near the river and\r\nwhere the White Horse appears, a scraggy creature rudely scratched in\r\nthe turf above a soft hollow in the downs. Chippenham is a little town\r\nin a wooded hollow, with a grey spire and stone bridge over the Avon.\r\nThen one reaches a stony country. The houses are no longer of brick, but\r\nall of stone. The Box tunnel is a result of the hills. The villas near\r\nBath, of grey stone, cling to the sides of the heights from whose\r\nquarries they were taken. In the valley are Hampton church and ferry.\r\n\r\n“Bath, an entirely stone city, has a consequent greyness of its own. The\r\nstreets have a desolate stateliness, and are still the abode of old\r\nmaids and card-playing dowagers as when described by Miss Austen; so\r\nBath-chairs are still the popular mode of conveyance to the frequent\r\ntea-parties. Beechen Cliff is a fine feature. In the centre of the town\r\nthe Abbey tower shows the poverty of perpendicular architecture.\r\n\r\n“By Kelsey Oaks we rush on to smoky Bristol, all energy and ugliness:\r\nthen a great strange rift in the hills shows where the Avon winds\r\nbeneath the rocks and hanging bridge of Clifton.\r\n\r\n“Now there is a change to softer scenery at Clevedon, Woodspring Priory,\r\nthe odd hill of Weston. The houses grow warmer as well as the\r\ncountry--no longer of grey, but of red sandstone: the Somersetshire\r\nchurches, proverbially fine, have pink-grey towers, their projections\r\ngilded with lichen. Now we pass through apple-orchards, and the thorns,\r\nsnow-drifted with bloom, stand knee-deep in the long mowing grass. In\r\nthe flats rises Bridgewater, then Taunton with its beautiful and\r\npicturesque towers standing out against the low grey hills; Exeter,\r\ncapped by the stumpy towers of its cathedral; and then the salt estuary\r\nof the Teign laps the bank of the railway and we enter the woods of\r\nPowderham.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Powderham, June 9._--I found the door open last night and walked\r\nstraight into the hall. Charlie Wood and Lady Agnes were there at tea,\r\nand people kept dropping in--a very pleasant party.... Lord Devon[200]\r\nis the kindest of hosts, full of small courtesies; but he is a great\r\ndeal away, flying up to London after dinner and returning next day: they\r\nsay he performs the circumference of the globe every year, and chiefly\r\non his own lines of railway.\r\n\r\n“Lord Devon’s only son, Lord Courtenay, is seldom here, but when he is,\r\namuses every one. One evening ‘Mademoiselle Bekker’ arrived late at\r\nPowderham, coming in the hope to obtain a chairman for a meeting which\r\nwas going to be held at Exeter in favour of the Rights of Women. There\r\nwas a very distinguished party in the house--the Bishop of Winchester,\r\nLord Halifax, the American Minister (Motley), &c., and they each, while\r\nrefusing, made a speech in answer to hers, which was most eloquent.\r\nEventually Mademoiselle Bekker declared herself so indignant as to be\r\nled to unsex herself: she was Lord Courtenay.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 12._--On Saturday we were called at daybreak, and went to Totness\r\nby rail, and thence in waggonettes eighteen miles through deep bosky\r\nlanes, and then over breezy uplands to the Moult, Lord Devon’s\r\nenchanting little place near Salcombe. Here the blue-green transparent\r\nsea glances through the thick foliage deep below the windings of the\r\nroad, and the quiet bay is encircled by rocky hills tufted with wood,\r\nwhich in parts feathers down into the water. We rested at North Sands\r\nCottage, a lovely wee place of Lord Devon’s, and then walked through the\r\ngrounds of his larger place of the Moult. Aloes grow and flourish here\r\nto an immense size. Beyond this a path--‘Lord Courtenay’s Walk’--runs\r\nhalf-way up the steep precipices above the sea.\r\n\r\n“It was an enchanting day, white wreaths of cloud drifting above in the\r\nblue, deep below the sea gloriously transparent, with all its\r\nweed-covered rocks visible through the waters, great white gulls\r\nswooping around with their wild outcries, and the pathlet winding up and\r\ndown the cliff, bordered by cistus and thrift in masses of pink\r\nluxuriance. On the steep descent to a cove, we were met by a welcome\r\nluncheon, and ate it high above some rock caverns which are very curious\r\nat that point.\r\n\r\n“One of the principal farmers belonging to an agricultural club near\r\nthis lost his wife lately, and in his kind way Lord Devon alluded to her\r\nat the annual club dinner,--speaking of her as an admirable, kind, and\r\nindustrious woman, and saying how he could feel with such a loss, having\r\nhad himself a bereavement which was ever present to him. But at last the\r\nfarmer interrupted him--‘I doan’t know what his Lordship be a talking\r\nabout; but I du know that she was an awful cranky, tiresome old woman,\r\nand God Almighty’s very welcome to she.’\r\n\r\n“Yesterday was Sunday. I went to the service at Powderham with Lord\r\nDevon and Lady Mary Fortescue in a chapel opposite the white recumbent\r\nmarble figure of Lady Devon. The afternoon was spent in the ‘plantation\r\ngarden,’ where an Australian gum-tree was in full flower. In the evening\r\nthere were prayers--‘Compline,’ they called it--a very living, earnest\r\nservice in the chapel.... Truly I felt, as I took leave of Charlie, that\r\nabove the door of every house that is his home might be inscribed the\r\nwords of S. Bernard engraved over the threshold of many Cistercian\r\nhouses--‘Bonum est nos hic esse, quia homo vivit purius, cadit rarius,\r\nsurgit velocius, incedit cautius, quiescit securius, moritur felicius,\r\npurgatur citius, praemiatur copiosius.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Abbots Kerswell, June 15._--Yesterday Sir Samuel and Lady Baker dined\r\nhere. He is most agreeable, and possesses _‘l’art de narrer’_ to\r\nperfection. He told a ghost-story in the evening, without either names,\r\ndates, or any definite material, and yet it was quite admirable, and\r\nkept the company breathless for three-quarters of an hour.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 16._--Yesterday we paid a long visit to Sir Samuel Baker. He has\r\nbought and made his place with the money he received from the Khedive\r\nfor his African discoveries.[201] The house is full of skeleton heads,\r\nhorns, &c. Many others were destroyed in the African depot by an insect\r\nwhich forces out the bone as with a gimlet, but fortunately it will not\r\nlive in England.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Charlton Hall, June 17._--I spent several hours in Bath on my way\r\nhere. It was an exquisite day, and everything was in great beauty. Bath\r\nseems a town exclusively intended for the rich. Everything being built\r\nof stone gives it a foreign character, and the height of the surrounding\r\nhills causes you to see green down every street. I felt age in the way\r\nin which everything looked so small in proportion to my recollection.\r\n\r\n“At Chippenham a dogcart from Lord Suffolk’s was waiting for me, and we\r\nrolled away down the dull lanes to Malmesbury. It was curious in one day\r\nto revisit, as it were, six years out of my former life. At Bath I had\r\nwalked up the hill to where I could look down upon Lyncombe, and what\r\nmemories it awakened of miserable longings after a fuller, more\r\ninteresting life, which lasted through the whole of two years and a half\r\nof wasted, monotonous, objectless time. Now in my full life, looking\r\ndown upon that richly wooded glen, it seemed quite beautiful; but in the\r\nwretched bondage of those weary years, how hideous it all was!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLTON HALL.]\r\n\r\n“At Chippenham, as I passed the park at Harnish, I went back farther\r\nstill to three years and a half of private school imprisonment and the\r\npettiest of petty miseries. They do not matter much now certainly, but\r\none does grudge six years of youth denuded of all that makes life\r\npleasant and beautiful.\r\n\r\n“Charlton is a magnificent old house of yellow-grey stone, Jacobean,\r\nopen on all sides, a perfect quadrangle. Inside, there was once a\r\ncourtyard, but a former Lord Suffolk closed it in. It remained for many\r\nyears a mere gravelled space: lately Lady Suffolk has had it paved, and\r\nto a certain extent furnished. The rooms are handsome in stucco\r\nornaments, but not picturesque. The pictures are glorious. There is one\r\nof the noblest known works of Leonardo da Vinci--‘La Vierge aux\r\nRochers,’ the figures all with the peculiar Leonardo type of face,\r\ngrouped in a rocky valley--strange, wild, and fantastic.[202] The\r\npicture which to me is most charming is ‘Le Raboteur,’ attributed to\r\nAnnibale Carracci. The Virgin, a sweet-looking peasant woman, yet with\r\nan expression of ‘pondering these things in her heart,’ is sitting\r\noutside her cottage door with her work-basket by her side. The boy\r\nJesus, in a simple blue tunic, is standing at the end of the carpenter’s\r\ntable--‘subject to his parents’--doing some measuring for old Joseph,\r\nwho is at work there. It is a quiet village group such as one has often\r\nseen, only elevated by expression.\r\n\r\n“There is a glorious old gallery with a noble ceiling, full of portraits\r\nand of old and interesting books. In the ‘rose parlour’ are more\r\npictures, and a ceiling the design of which is repeated in the\r\nflower-garden. Many of the pictures belonged to James II. When he fled,\r\nhe sent them to be taken care of by Colonel Graham, who had married the\r\nEarl of Berkshire’s daughter, and William III. afterwards allowed them\r\nto remain.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 18._--Yesterday it rained at intervals all day. I drew the\r\ngallery, and enjoyed talking to Lady Suffolk,[203] who sat by me, with a\r\ncharm of face and manner and mind which recalls Donne’s lines--\r\n\r\n    ‘No spring or summer beauty hath such grace\r\n     As I have seen on one autumnal face.’\r\n\r\nShe lives so far more in the heavenly than the earthly horizons, that\r\none feels raised above earth whilst one is with her. She spoke of the\r\nimpossibility of believing in eternity of punishment, yet of the mass of\r\ndifficulties besetting all explanations. She talked of a woman in the\r\nvillage in failing health and unhappy. Being asked if she was not\r\ntroubled in her mind, she confessed that she was, but said, ‘It is not\r\nfor want of light; I have had plenty of light.’ She said her father had\r\nsaid to her, ‘Now if you go to hell, Hannah, it will not be for want of\r\nlight.’\r\n\r\n“Some one had urged Lady Suffolk to go and hear Moody and Sankey,\r\nbecause their sermons on heaven were such a refreshment and rest: she\r\nhad gone, and the sermon had all been about hell.\r\n\r\n“Lady Victoria drove me to Malmesbury. The town cross is beautiful. The\r\nAbbey is a gigantic remnant of a colossal whole; the existing church\r\nbeing about two-thirds of the nave of the original abbey-church, entered\r\nby a magnificent Norman door. By the altar is a tomb to King Athelstan,\r\nerected some centuries after his death, and there is a gallery like\r\nPrior Bolton’s in Smithfield.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 18._--I sleep at Charlton in the ‘king’s room,’ so called from\r\nJames II. It is hung with tapestry and old pictures. As we were going to\r\nbed, Andover said, ‘You sleep in the haunted room.’ Consequently every\r\nnoise, which I had never observed before, troubled me through the night.\r\nOne ought never to be _told_ that a room is haunted.\r\n\r\n“Conversation has been much about Mrs. Wagstaff, a homœopathic\r\nclairvoyant, wife of an allopathic doctor at Leighton Buzzard. She comes\r\nup to London if desired, and works wonderful cures. _In_ her trances her\r\nconversation is most remarkable, but out of them she is a very ordinary\r\nperson. She never remembers when awake having seen any one (with her\r\neyes half-open) in a trance, but meets as a perfect stranger the person\r\nshe has just been talking to for half-an-hour.\r\n\r\n“It was odd on Sunday having no service in church till six in the\r\nevening, but certainly very pleasant. We walked in the park beforehand\r\nto Sans Souci, a pretty wood in which a clear stream has its source,\r\nthrowing up the sand in the oddest way in a large round basin. Numbers\r\nof trees were lying about, cut down, as Andover said, ‘to meet the\r\nannual demand for the needy.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 19._--The Andovers’ little girl is most amusing. At six, if she\r\ncatches a new word, she uses it without the slightest idea as to its\r\nmeaning. Her maid Sabina went to her to-day and said, ‘Now, Miss Howard,\r\nI must put on your things, for you must go out.’--‘No, Sabina, you must\r\nnot,’ promptly said ‘Tiny-Wee.’--‘But I really must, Miss Howard,’ said\r\nSabina.--‘No, Sabina, you must not,’ persisted Tiny-Wee.--‘And why, Miss\r\nHoward?’ said Sabina.--‘Because, Sabina, it is _co-eternal_,’ said\r\nTiny-Wee very solemnly; and Sabina was utterly quelled and gave way at\r\nonce. It is needless to say that Tiny had been to church and heard the\r\nAthanasian Creed.\r\n\r\n“Andover has been describing a clergyman who preached on the fatted\r\ncalf, and sought his words as well as his ideas as he proceeded\r\nextempore, and said, ‘He came home, my brethren, he came home to his\r\nfather, to his dear father, and his father killed for him the fatted\r\ncalf, which he had been saving up for years, my brethren--saving up for\r\n_years_ for some festive occasion.’\r\n\r\n“He told of an American who never was in time for anything in his life,\r\nwas unpunctual for everything systematically. One day, in a very\r\nout-of-the-way place, he fell into a cataleptic state, and was supposed\r\nto be dead. According to the rapidity of American movement, instead of\r\nbringing the undertaker to him, they took him to the undertaker, who\r\nfitted him with a coffin and left him, only laying the coffin lid\r\nloosely on the outside of it. In the middle of the night he awoke from\r\nhis trance, pushed off the lid, and finding himself in a place alone\r\nsurrounded by a quantity of coffins, he jumped up and pushed off the lid\r\nof the coffin nearest to him. He found nothing. He tried another:\r\nnothing. ‘Good God!’ he cried, ‘I’ve been late all my life, and now I’m\r\nlate for the resurrection!’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 20._--Yesterday we had a delightful drive to see Lady Cowley at\r\nDraycot, a most charming place of happy medium size, in a park full of\r\nfern and old oaks. Lord Mornington, who left it to the Cowleys, was\r\nquite a distant cousin, and they expected nothing. He came to dine with\r\nthem occasionally at Paris, he mounted Lady Feodore for the Bois de\r\nBoulogne, and one day they suddenly found themselves the heirs of\r\nDraycot, perfectly fitted up with everything they could possibly wish\r\nfor. It was like a fairy story, and Lady Cowley has never attempted to\r\nconceal her enchantment at it.\r\n\r\n“To-day we went to a different place--Mr. Holford’s new house of\r\nWestonbirt. It is an immense building in a flat, ugly situation. The\r\nhall goes up the whole height of the house, with open galleries to the\r\nbedrooms, so that every one sees who goes in and out of them. The\r\ndining-room has a fine Jacobean chimney-piece and modern Corinthian\r\npillars. There is a great chimney-piece in another room, which was an\r\naltar in a church at Rome. All is huge, and seemed very comfortless.\r\n\r\n“It has been a most happy visit to the Suffolks, with whom one is\r\ncompletely at home. As Lady Suffolk says, though they have often wished\r\nto be rich, they have been much happier for being poor, for they have\r\nall been obliged to do their part in the house and place, and all that\r\nhas to be carried on there, and so it is to them not only the scene of\r\ntheir life, but of their work.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 22._--Yesterday I went to Oxford, and came in, without intending\r\nit, for Commemoration. I will never go there again if I can help it. It\r\nis like visiting a grave of happy past years.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 28._--Went to Holland House. The deep shade of its lofty avenue\r\nis enchanting as one turns in from the baking street of Kensington. Lady\r\nHolland sat in the inner room, with her sweet face encircled by the\r\nprettiest of old-fashioned caps. Beau Atkinson was with her, with a\r\nlovely little Skye dog in his arms, and Lady Lilford with her two fine\r\nboys. After talking some time, we wandered into the gardens under the\r\nold cedars. When we came in, old Mr. Cheney was leaning over Lady\r\nHolland’s chair, chuckling to himself over the dogmatic self-assertion\r\nof Mr. Hayward,[204] who was talking to her of books, the value of which\r\nhe considered to be quite decided by his opinion of them. Especially he\r\ntalked of Ticknor’s Memoirs, so remarkable because, though he was an\r\nAmerican of the most lowly origin, it is evident that when he came to\r\nEurope he not only saw the best society of every country he visited, but\r\nsaw it intimately--which could only have been due to his own personal\r\ncharm.\r\n\r\n“Dined at Lady Barrington’s. She said I must be presented, and George\r\nBarrington said he should present me.\r\n\r\n“L. was full of a dinner she had been at at Count Beust’s. The Prince\r\nImperial was there, who had always hitherto been regarded as only a\r\npleasant boy, but who electrified them on this occasion by a remarkable\r\nflash of wit. It had been impossible to avoid asking the French\r\nAmbassador, but Count Beust had taken especial pains to make it as\r\nlittle offensive as possible. He took in the Princess of Wales to supper\r\nand placed her at the same table with the Prince Imperial. The Comte and\r\nComtesse d’Harcourt were at another table with the Prince of Wales.\r\nSuddenly an offensive pushing man, first secretary to the French\r\nembassy, brought Mademoiselle d’Harcourt to the Prince Imperial’s table\r\nand sat down. The Prince was very much annoyed. Looking up at a picture\r\nof the Emperor of Austria, he asked if it resembled him--‘I do not\r\nremember him, I was so very young when I saw him,’ and then in a louder\r\ntone, ‘I wonder how the French Ambassador represents the Republic of\r\nFrance on the walls of his rooms.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 29._--Yesterday I went down into Kent for Miss Virginia Smith’s\r\nwedding with young Francis Villiers,[205] toiling in a cab with Lady\r\nCraven over the hot chalky hills. The breakfast was at Selsden Park, a\r\nlovely place belonging to a child-heiress, Erroll Smith’s daughter.\r\n\r\n“Dined with Lady Head, and we went on together to Baroness Burdett\r\nCoutts’, where Irving read _Macbeth_ to an immense company, chiefly\r\nbishops and archbishops and their belongings. The reading was stilted\r\nand quite ineffective.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 30._--A most pleasant party at Lord Ducie’s--Mr. and Miss Froude,\r\nSir James Lacaita, Miss Grant the sculptress, Lord Aberdeen and Lady\r\nKatherine, Lord Northbrook and Lady Emma Baring, Lord Camperdown, Mr.,\r\nMrs., and Miss Gladstone, Lord Vernon, George and Lady Constance\r\nShaw-Lefevre, &c.\r\n\r\n“There was very agreeable conversation, chiefly about Macaulay’s\r\nLife--of his wonderful memory and the great power it gave him. Gladstone\r\nsaid the most astonishing thing about him was that he could remember not\r\nonly the things worth knowing, but the most extraordinary amount of\r\ntrash. He described another man he knew who, after once reading over the\r\nadvertisement sheet of the _Times_, could repeat it straight through.\r\n\r\n“In the evening I was asked to tell a story, and did, feeling that if\r\nIrving amused people for about three hundred nights of the year, it was\r\nrather hard if I declined to amuse him on one of the remaining\r\nsixty-five. He enjoyed it more than any one else, and lingering behind,\r\nwhen all were gone but Mrs. Gladstone and one or two others, said, ‘Now\r\nthat we are such a very small party, do tell us another.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 6._--Went by rail with Mr. Ralph Dutton and ‘Beauty Stephens’ to\r\nSyon. It is a great house in a low-lying park, on the edge of which the\r\nThames is marked by its great lines of tall sedges and the barges going\r\nup and down with music through the flat meadow-lands. On the parapet of\r\nthe house is the poor old lion from Northumberland House. The lime-trees\r\nwere in flower, scenting the whole air.\r\n\r\n“Lady Percy received in the gallery, and about two thousand guests were\r\ncollected on the lawn. I took courage and went and talked to the\r\nJapanese ambassadress, who was very smiling, but did not say much beyond\r\n‘Me speak leetle English and no moosh French.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 7._--Went by water with Mrs. Mostyn, Miss Monk, and Miss Milnes\r\nto Fulham. The steamer was actually two hours and a half on the way.\r\nThere was an interest in recognising a whole gallery of De Wint’s\r\nsketches in the tall bosky trees, the weirs, the great water-plants, and\r\nstill more on the causeway leading from Fulham Church to the palace. It\r\nwas a gloriously hot day, and very pleasant sitting under the old\r\ngateway looking into the sunlit court, with full light on the rich\r\ndecorations of the brickwork and the massy creepers.\r\n\r\n“Afterwards, I was at a beautiful and charming party at Holland House. A\r\nnumber of grown-up royalties and a whole bevy of royal children sat\r\nunder the trees watching Punch and Judy. The Prince Imperial, with\r\ncharming natural manners, walked about and talked to every one he knew.\r\nI was happy in finding Lady Andover and many other friends. Towards the\r\nend, Lady Wynford said the Princess Amelie of Schleswig[206] desired\r\nthat I might be presented to her, as she had read my books, &c. She is\r\nelderly, but enjoys life and dances at all the balls she is asked to,\r\nespecially at Pau, of which she talked with animation.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COURTYARD, FULHAM PALACE.][207]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 8._--At luncheon at Lady Alwyn Compton’s I met Lady Marion\r\nAlford. There was much talk of the wills of old London citizens--how Mr.\r\nBancroft had desired in his that for a hundred years a loaf of bread and\r\na bottle of wine should be placed in his vault every year on the\r\nanniversary of his death, because he was convinced that before that time\r\nhe should awake from his death-sleep and require it, and the hundred\r\nyears had only just expired;--of how Jeremy Bentham’s body, in\r\naccordance with his will, was produced a year after his death at the\r\nfeast of a club he had founded, and how all the company fled from it.\r\n\r\n“I was afterwards at a breakfast at Lord Bute’s. There were few people I\r\nknew there, and the grass was very wet, so I sat under the verandah with\r\nthe Egertons. Presently an old lady was led out there, very old, and\r\nevidently unable to walk, but with a dear beautiful face, dressed in\r\nwidow’s weeds. She seemed to know no one, so gradually--I do not know\r\nhow it came about--I gave her a rose, and sat down at her feet on the\r\nmat and she talked of many beautiful things. She was evidently sitting\r\nin the most peaceful waiting upon the very threshold of the heavenly\r\nkingdom. When I was going away she said, ‘I should like to know whom I\r\nhave been talking to.’ I said, ‘My name is Augustus Hare.’ She said, ‘I\r\ndivined that when you gave me the flower.’ I have not a notion who she\r\nwas.[208]\r\n\r\n“I dined at Sir John Lefevre’s, and was pained to see how weak and\r\nfailing he looks. The Rianos were there and Sir James Lacaita, and in\r\nthe evening Lady Ducie came in, radiant with goodness and beauty.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 11._--A very pleasant dinner at Lord Ebury’s. He overflows with\r\nkindness. He said, ‘If this hot weather is trying for you and me, it is\r\nvery good for the corn: that hardens, while we melt.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 13._--Luncheon with Sir C. Trevelyan, who showed me Macaulay’s\r\nlibrary, and then drove me to see the remnant of the house of Villiers,\r\nDuke of Buckingham, in Villiers Street. Peter the Great lived there when\r\nin London, and David Copperfield is made to lodge there by Dickens.\r\n\r\n“Dined at Lord Cardwell’s, where I sat by George Otto Trevelyan, the\r\nauthor of Lord Macaulay’s Life. At Lord Sherborne’s in the evening I\r\nfound Irving, with all the three hundred nights of his _Hamlet_ written\r\non his face. I was introduced to Dr. Ellicott, Bishop of Gloucester and\r\nBristol, a little dapper man in a violet coat.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 14._--Luncheon at Mrs. Lowe’s. She was most amusing about her\r\npets. ‘Mr. Lowe, you know, is always going out and bringing home a new\r\nanimal: he does like pets so. He went and he bought a dog, and then he\r\nwent and bought a parrot, and then he bought a cockatoo and a cat, and I\r\nsaid, “Mr. Lowe, if you go and buy any more pets, I will go out of the\r\nhouse, because I will _not_ bear it,” and then Mr. Lowe went and bought\r\nBow-wow, the little white dog, and it had not cut its teeth, and it was\r\nso dreadfully ill, and we had to nurse it, and it gave us more trouble\r\nthan all the other pets put together; and I like Bow-wow the best of\r\nthem all, and Mrs. Scutt (that’s the housekeeper) is just the same.\r\n\r\n“‘I said to Mr. Lowe, “If you will go downstairs with that cockatoo on\r\nyour shoulder, it will fly away out of the window, and you’ll lose him,”\r\nbut Mr. Lowe would do it, you know, he’s so obstinate; and it was just\r\nas I said, and the cockatoo flew out of the staircase window, and Mr.\r\nLowe was in a fine way about him. There are a lot of boys watching for\r\nhim now, and he’ll come back some day, for every one knows Mr. Lowe’s\r\ncockatoo: but he won’t come back yet. And finely he’s enjoying himself,\r\nthat bird is; he’s never had such a fine time in his life; he’s finished\r\nall the cherries in Eldon Grove, and he’s just beginning upon the\r\ngooseberries.\r\n\r\n“‘When we drive down to Caterham, Bow-wow and Elfin, the two dogs, sit\r\nupon the back-seat, and the cat sits in the middle. They look out of the\r\nwindows and amuse themselves wonderfully, and finely the people stare.\r\n\r\n“‘When I first married Mr. Lowe we lived at Oxford. It was quite\r\ndelightful: we had all the interesting society of the University, and\r\nMr. Lowe was a tutor and taught all the clever young men. When we went\r\nup to London, we hired a coach, and had six first-class men inside, all\r\nMr. Lowe’s pupils. Then Mr. Lowe’s eyes failed, and we threw it all up\r\nand went to Australia, and were away six years; but it answered to us,\r\nfor I had some money left to me at that time, and Mr. Lowe had some\r\nmoney left to him, and we invested it there in houses, and they pay us\r\n60 per cent., and we made our fortunes.\r\n\r\n“‘How sad the Duchess of ---- going away is! She cried so dreadfully when\r\nshe went, that I am sure it’s for ever. Don’t you think, if I had had a\r\ndreadful quarrel with Mr. Lowe, and we had parted for ever, that I\r\nshould cry too? It is a very different thing when it is not for ever. I\r\ngo off to Wiesbaden for six weeks, and I wish Mr. Lowe good-bye, and I\r\nsay, “Well, good-bye, Mr. Lowe; in six weeks you’ll have me back\r\nagain,” and if we have quarrelled, it does not signify; but it would be\r\nvery different if it was for ever. Why, I should cry my eyes out.’\r\n\r\n“One day, however, when Mrs. Lowe was inveighing against the absurdity\r\nof the marriage service--of the bridegroom’s statement, ‘With all my\r\nworldly goods I thee endow,’ even when he possessed nothing and it was\r\njust the other way, and when she was saying, ‘Now when I married Mr.\r\nLowe, he had nothing whatever but his brains’--a deep voice from the end\r\nof the room growled out, ‘Well, my love, I certainly did not endow you\r\nwith those.’\r\n\r\n“‘Why contend against your natural advantages?’ said Mr. Lowe one day to\r\na deaf friend who was holding up an ear-trumpet to listen to a bore.\r\n\r\n“In the afternoon I drove down with Lady Sherborne, Miss Dutton, and\r\nMiss Elliot to see Lord Russell at Pembroke Lodge. It is a beautiful\r\nplace; not merely a bit of Richmond Park, but a bit of old forest\r\nenclosed, with grand old oaks and fern. The Queen gives it to Lord\r\nRussell, who, at eighty-four,[209] was seated in a Bath-chair in the\r\ngarden, on a sort of bowling-green, watching his grandsons play at\r\ntennis. Though he no longer comprehends present events, he is said to be\r\nperfectly clear about a far-away past, and will converse at any length\r\nabout Napoleon, the escape from Elba, &c. When I was presented to him,\r\nby way of something to say, I spoke of having seen the historical mound\r\nin his garden, and asked what it was that Henry VIII. watched for from\r\nthence as a death-signal, ‘was it a rocket or a black flag?’\r\n\r\n“‘It was a rocket.’\r\n\r\n“‘Then that would imply that the execution was at night, for he would\r\nhardly have seen a rocket by day.’\r\n\r\n“‘No, it was not at night; it was very early in the morning. She was a\r\nvery much maligned woman was that Anne Boleyn.’\r\n\r\n“We all sat by a fountain under the oak-trees, and then went into the\r\nhouse to a sort of five-o’clock tea on a large scale.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, July 15._--Returned to the dear little home, where I found\r\nCharlotte Leycester sitting on the terrace surrounded by the dogs,\r\nlooking on the lovely view from our greenery. The intense freshness of\r\nthe air, the glory of the flowers, the deep blue sea beyond our upland\r\nhayfields, and the tame doves cooing in the copper beech-tree, are\r\ncertainly a refreshing contrast to London, though I should never have\r\nbeen able to leave it unless Duty had pulled at me.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Highcliffe, July 24._--In this most unearthly Paradise all looks like\r\nlast year going on still--the huge stems of chestnut, and the white\r\nlilies and bulrushes in the great vase relieved against the old boiserie\r\nof the saloon; the wide window-porch open to the fountain and\r\norange-trees and sunlit terraces and sea; Lady Waterford coming in her\r\nhat and long sweeping dress through the narrow wind-blown arbutus\r\navenue; old Mrs. Hamilton-Hamilton in her pleasant sitting-room, with\r\nMiss Lindsay hovering about and waiting on her like a maid-of-honour;\r\nthe Ellices, so cordial and pleasant, so beaming with kindness and\r\ngoodness, their largeness of heart quite preventing their being able to\r\nindulge in the sectarian part of their own religious ideas.... I have\r\nfelt, as I always do very shy at first, and then entirely at home.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 25._--We have all, I think, basked as much in the mental sunshine\r\nof this beautiful life as in the external sunshine which illumines the\r\nbrilliant flowers and glancing sea.\r\n\r\n“We walked on the shore this afternoon. ‘See what festival the sea has\r\nbeen making, and what beautiful coloured weeds she has been scattering,’\r\nsaid Lady Waterford. We found two little boots projecting from the sand,\r\nand as we dug them out and found them _filled_ and stiff, we really\r\nexpected a drowned child to follow; but it was only sand that filled\r\nthem, and the little Payne child of Chewton Bunny had lost them when\r\nbathing. As we sat on the shore while Lady Waterford looked for fossils,\r\na staith came down from the Bunny and flooded the little stream into a\r\nriver, cutting off our return. We, the male part, crossed much higher\r\nup: Lady Waterford plunged in and walked: Lady Jane took off shoes and\r\nstockings and waded.\r\n\r\n“Lady Waterford has talked much of marriages--how even indifferent\r\nmarriages tone down into a degree of comfort which is better for most\r\nwomen than desolation.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 26._--We walked in the evening to the Haven House. The old\r\npine-wood, with its roots writhing out of the sand, and its lovely\r\nviews, over still reaches of water to the great grey church, and the\r\nherons fishing, are more picturesque than ever. Afterwards Lady Herbert\r\nof Lea arrived with her beautiful daughter Gladys.[210] Lady Herbert is\r\nsuffering still from the bite of a scorpion when she was drawing in the\r\nruins of Karnac.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Louisa, Marchioness of Waterford.\r\n\r\nFrom a Photograph by W. J. Reed. Bournamouth.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 29._--In the afternoon I went with Lady Waterford to General\r\nMaberly, who talked, as it seemed to me, very sensibly about the\r\nexaggerations of teetotalism. He thought that every one should do as\r\nthey pleased, and that it was wrong of a great landowner to prevent the\r\nexistence of a public-house on his estate: that it was following the\r\nteaching of the Baptist rather than that of our Saviour, for ‘was not\r\nour Saviour a wine-bibber?’\r\n\r\n“Lady Waterford has been speaking of sympathy for others; that there is\r\nnothing more distressing than to see another person _mortified_.\r\n\r\n“‘Mama could never bear to see any one mortified. Once at Paris, at a\r\nball they had, there was a poor lady, and not only her chignon, but the\r\nwhole edifice of hair she had, fell off in the dance. And Mama was so\r\nsorry for her, and, when all the ladies tittered, as she was Madame\r\nl’Ambassadrice and a person of some influence, I don’t think it was\r\nwrong of her to apply the verse, and she said, “Let the woman among us\r\nwho has no false hair be the first to throw a stone at her.”’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 30._--Hamilton Aïdé says he went to visit two or three times at a\r\nlunatic asylum. The matron, a very nice person, said, ‘There is here a\r\nvery extraordinary example of a person who has become quite mad, and\r\nonly from vanity.’ He went to see her. It was a very old lady, with\r\ngreat traces of beauty and dignity of manner, but she wore the most\r\nextraordinary bonnet, very large, and from the fringe hung a pair of\r\nscissors, a thimble, and a needle-book. He made a civil speech to her\r\nabout being glad to see her looking so well, or something of that kind.\r\nIn reply she only just looked up and said, ‘For further information\r\nrefer to the 25th chapter of the second Book of Kings,’ and took no more\r\nnotice whatever.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 31._--Lady Jane Ellice says that there are three shades of people\r\none likes--those whom one must see in heaven, for it would not be heaven\r\nwithout them: those whom one hopes to see in heaven and to meet there:\r\nand those whom one hopes will be _in_ heaven but that one will not see\r\nthem there. Her singing this evening of ‘Zurich’s Blue Waters,’ ‘Three\r\nBlue Bottles,’ &c., has been perfectly charming.\r\n\r\n“Lady Waterford has been telling of Ruskin ‘like a little wizened rat.’\r\n‘He likes to be adored, but then Somers and I did adore him, and he\r\nlikes to lash his disciples with rods of iron. I do not mind that: it is\r\nhis jokes I cannot bear; they make me so sorry and miserable for him.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 3._--Lady Waterford said that Lady Stuart, when a Frenchman\r\ntried to talk to her in very bad English, told him she preferred talking\r\nFrench. ‘Ah,’ he said, ‘vous aimez mieux, Madame, écorcher les oreilles\r\ndes autres, qu’on vous écorche vos oreilles.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 5._--I have left Highcliffe, and the gates of Paradise seem\r\nclosed for a year. There has been the usual perfect confidence about\r\neverything through the whole party: the pleasant going backwards and\r\nforwards to ‘Hamilton Place,’ and the waiting upon old Mrs. Hamilton of\r\nher ‘equerry’ and her ‘maid-of-honour:’ the many friendly snubs and\r\ncontradictions which rail at all the smallnesses and ennoble all the\r\nhigher aims of life. After luncheon we all sat in the porch surrounded\r\nby the great lilies and geraniums in flower and we had coffee there,\r\nlooking upon the Isle of Wight with the Needles looming through the\r\nmist: then we parted.\r\n\r\n“It was a long drive in pouring rain from Southampton to Sydney Lodge,\r\nwhere I found a warm welcome from dear old Lady Hardwicke.[211] It is a\r\nmoderate house, with large gardens, into which bits of old forest are\r\ninterwoven. This morning we drove to Eliot Yorke’s house at Netley Fort,\r\nan old tower of the monks, in front of which the _Mayflower_ set sail.\r\nThe situation is lovely, close to the sea, with a hilly garden in\r\nminiature and a machicolated tower rising out of ivy walls like a scene\r\nin a play. But the great charm is in Eliot himself, so handsome, with\r\nsuch a pleasant smile and melodious voice. His Jewess wife, Agneta\r\nMontagu, and Hinchinbroke were there. From the garden we went to the\r\nAbbey, where I drew while Hinchinbroke amused himself by pretending to\r\nmake love to an old lady (‘Jemima Anne’) who was peering about in\r\nspectacles amongst the arches. When we went back, boats were arriving\r\nfrom Cowes at the little wharf--the Prince Imperial with the Duke and\r\nDuchess of St. Albans and a crowd of others. The Prince has the most\r\npleasant, frank, simple manners, and makes himself agreeable to every\r\none. He was much amused with the quantities of Yorkes who seemed to crop\r\nup from every house round, and said he ‘thought he must have landed by\r\nmistake on the coast of Yorkshire.’ His arm was in a sling, and he\r\nlooked pale and fagged, for somehow, in playing at leap-frog with his\r\n‘camarades,’ he had tumbled into a camp-fire, and, to save his face, had\r\ninstinctively put out his hands, and burnt the whole skin off one of\r\nthem. It must have been terrible agony, but he never complained.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 6._--The Yorkes are absolutely devoted to each other. There is\r\nsuch family loyalty that every peccadillo is consecrated. I certainly do\r\nnot wonder at their love for Eliot; he has such a sweet though frank\r\nmanner, and is so genial and kind to every one.[212] L. has been talking\r\nof the advantages of even an unhappy married life over a single one, as\r\nexemplified by the poor Empress, who herself said, ‘C’est mieux d’être\r\nmal à deux que d’être seule.’\r\n\r\n“L. was at a party at Mrs. Brand’s, sitting by Lady Cork, when Lady\r\nFrancis Gordon came up to her. ‘Come, Lady Cork, can you spell in five\r\nletters the three scourges of society?’ (drink, rink, ink). ‘No,’ said\r\nLady Cork instantly, ‘that I cannot do, but I can spell in two letters\r\nthe two blessings of society--U and I.’\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Eliot Yorke is exceedingly pleasing and much beloved in her\r\nhusband’s family. Amongst the few Jews I have known, I have always found\r\nthe women infinitely superior to the men, and this is especially the\r\ncase with the Rothschilds. Some one once made an observation of this\r\nkind to Rogers the poet. ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘the men crucified Him, but\r\nthe women--wept.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 12._--Last Monday I went to Cobham for a few days, arriving\r\njust as the setting sun was illuminating the grand old red brick house\r\ndeeply set in its massy woods. A large party was assembled, its most\r\ninteresting element being Fanny, Lady Winchilsea, who is always\r\ndelightful. Archdeacon Cust told me a curious story of a Mr. Phipps, a\r\nclergyman at Slough. He asked him if he was related to Lord Normanby’s\r\nfamily, and he said they were related, but that they had never known one\r\nanother, and that the reason was a strange one. His father had been\r\nresiding at Caen, where they had become very intimate with a French\r\nfamily called Beaurepaire. After his father left Caen, the great\r\nRevolution occurred, and all the Beaurepaire family perished on the\r\nscaffold except the youngest daughter, who, for some unknown reason, was\r\nspared. Having no relation left alive, she was utterly desolate, and\r\nfelt that no one in the world cared for her but young Phipps, the son of\r\nher former neighbour, who had evinced an attachment for her. So to the\r\nPhipps family she somehow made her way; but they, disapproving the\r\nattachment, were all excessively unkind to her, except one sister, who\r\nreceived her, and went out with her to India, where her brother was then\r\nsupposed to be. But when they reached India, they found, with despair,\r\nthat Phipps had left and gone to Egypt. Thither, however, they pursued\r\nhim, and there Mademoiselle de Beaurepaire was married to him. Young\r\nPhipps would never forgive the unkindness which had been shown to his\r\nwife by his family, and the two branches of the Phipps family were never\r\nafterwards friends.\r\n\r\n“A schoolmaster near Cobham, named King, for some reason best known to\r\nhimself, has abolished the game of football--a most unpopular move. The\r\nboys were furious, and one day, when the master entered the schoolroom,\r\nhe found ‘King is a donkey’ chalked up in large letters on a board. For\r\nan instant he was perplexed; but it would never do to take no notice. He\r\nleft the inscription, but added the single word--‘driver.’ The boys\r\nquite saw the joke, and the master’s prestige was restored.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Ampthill Park, August 29, 1876._--I came here on Monday, stopping some\r\nhours in London on the way, and finding out ancient treasures in the\r\npurlieus of Soho and St. Giles’s, which, black and filthy as they are,\r\nare still full of reminiscences.\r\n\r\n“At St. Pancras Station I saw a very ancient lady in a yellow wig step\r\ninto a railway carriage by herself, and her footman guard the door till\r\nthe train started, and I felt sure it was the Dowager Duchess of\r\nCleveland. At Ampthill Station the Lowther carriage was waiting for both\r\nof us, and we drove off together. She talked the whole way, but the\r\ncarriage rumbled so that I could hardly hear a word she said, except\r\nthat when I remarked ‘What a fine tree!’ as we entered the park, she\r\nanswered rather sharply ‘That _was_ a fine tree.’ She spoke too of the\r\nLowther boys--‘They are having their vacancies. I like that word\r\nvacancies,’ she said.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHURCHYARD OF ST. ANNE, SOHO.][213]\r\n\r\n“It is a fine wild park, with most unexpected ups and downs and a great\r\ndeal of grand old timber, on a ridge rising high above the blue\r\nBedfordshire plain, in the midst of which a spire rising out of a little\r\ndrift of smoke indicates the town of Bedford. On one of the highest\r\npoints of the ridge a cross raised on steps marks the site of the royal\r\nresidence where Katherine of Arragon lived for most of her\r\nsemi-widowhood, and where Anne Boleyn shot stags in a green velvet\r\ntrain. The later house, approached on the garden side by a narrow\r\ndownhill avenue half a mile long, is in the old French style, with posts\r\nand chains, broad steps widening at the top, and a _perron_.... The\r\nDuchess, at eighty-four, talked most pleasantly and interestingly all\r\nevening. Lady Wensleydale, in her high cap and large chair, with her\r\nsweet face and expression, sat by like an old picture. There is a\r\npicture of her thus, by Pointer, surrounded by great white azaleas, but\r\nit does not do her justice.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday I drove with James, Mildred, and Cecil Lowther to Wrest. It\r\nis a most stately place, one of the stateliest I have ever seen. The\r\ngardens were all laid out by Le Nôtre, and the house was of that period.\r\nLord De Grey pulled down the house, and found it rested on no\r\nfoundations whatever, but on the bare ground. It was so thin, that when\r\nthe still-room maid complained that her room was rather dark, the\r\nfootman took out his penknife and cut her a square hole for a window in\r\nthe plaster wall. Capability Brown was employed to rearrange the\r\ngardens, which were thought hideous at one time; but though he spoilt so\r\nmany other places, he had sense to admire the work of Le Notre so much\r\nhere, that he made no alterations, except throwing a number of round and\r\noblong tanks into one long canal, which, on the whole, is rather an\r\nimprovement. The modern house is magnificent, and like what Chantilly\r\nmust have been.\r\n\r\n“On the vast flagged terrace in front of the windows we found Lady\r\nCowper[214] sitting in an old-fashioned black silk dress and tight\r\nwhite bonnet. She has a most sweet face, and was very kind and charming\r\nin her manner. I walked with her for a long time on the terrace, looking\r\ndown on the brilliant gardens, and beyond them upon equally brilliant\r\ngroups of people, for it was the annual meeting of the great\r\nBedfordshire tennis club, for which she always gives a breakfast. She\r\ntold the whole story of the place, and took me to see all the finest\r\npoints of view and the great collection of fine orange-trees brought\r\nfrom Versailles. She greatly lamented the prudishness of her great-aunt\r\n(Lady De Grey), through whom her grandmother had derived the place, who\r\nthought most of the old French statues--which, according to the custom\r\nof that day, were made of lead--to be insufficiently dressed, and so\r\nsold them for the value of the metal, at the same time that she sold an\r\nincomparable collection of old plate, for the same reason, for its\r\nweight in silver. She showed one of the statues, backed by a yew hedge\r\nsome centuries old. ‘That poor lady, you see, was saved when all the\r\nothers were sent away, because she had got a few clothes on.’ Lord De\r\nGrey had replaced some of the statues, and Lady Cowper herself had added\r\na most beautiful fountain from Carrara, with a very flat basin.\r\n\r\n“Lady Cowper talked much of my mother and the ‘Memorials’ and of ‘my\r\nsister Lady Jocelyn.’ She spoke of the extreme quietude of her own life.\r\n‘A day like this (pointing out the crowd below) shows me that what this\r\nplace wants is--_people_, and I never have any. I think I must hire some\r\npuppets to walk about and represent them.’ There are a number of\r\ninscriptions in the grounds to different past-members of the family and\r\ntheir friends. Lady Cowper said that Lady Palmerston, who was very\r\nmatter-of-fact, thought that of course they were buried there, and said,\r\n‘How I do pity Anne, living alone at Wrest, surrounded by all those\r\ngraves of her family.’ Graves, however, there are, but of deceased dogs,\r\na regular burial-ground, with headstones like those in a churchyard,\r\nsurrounded by a wall of clipped yew.\r\n\r\n“I was very glad to find Henry Cowper, who showed me the rooms, which\r\nwere full of people for the ‘breakfast,’ but I saw the two great Sir\r\nJoshuas, which are magnificent, especially that of Lady Lucas and Lady\r\nGrantham, as very young girls, with a bird.\r\n\r\n“In the evening at Ampthill I told the story of Mary-Eleanor, Lady\r\nStrathmore, to which Lady Wensleydale added her reminiscence of having\r\nbeen told, at four years old, of Stoney Bowes having ‘nailed his wife’s\r\ntongue to a table.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 30._--Yesterday I drew with Miss Lowther at the ruins of\r\nHoughton Hall, the old home of the Russells, where Philip Sidney wrote\r\nverses under the trees. It is a very stately though not a large house,\r\nand beautiful in colour, from the mixture of red brick and\r\nyellow-lichened stone. A great avenue, now utterly ruined, leads away\r\nfrom it direct to Bedford, which lies six miles away in the elm-lined\r\nplain. It was deserted because Lord Tavistock, returning from hunting,\r\nwas thrown from his horse and killed on the spot in the presence of his\r\nwife, who was waiting for him on the doorstep: the family could never\r\nbear to live there again.[215]\r\n\r\n“After luncheon, I walked with the old Duchess in the avenue. She\r\ndescribed being couched. ‘Did you take chloroform?’--‘Oh, certainly not:\r\nno such thing: I should not have thought of it. Don’t _you_ know that\r\ncouching is a very dangerous operation? the very slightest movement\r\nmight be fatal to it. I did not know what might happen under chloroform,\r\nbut I knew that _I_ should never flinch if I had my senses, and I never\r\ndid: and in three weeks, though I was still bandaged up, I was out\r\nwalking.’\r\n\r\n“‘What was worse than becoming blind in my case,’ said the Duchess, ‘was\r\nbreaking my knee-pan, for then, you know, one bone goes up and the other\r\ngoes down, and you never really have the use of your knee again.’\r\n\r\n“‘And yet here you are walking, Duchess.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, certainly _I_ am. Prescott Hewitt said I never should walk again,\r\nand I said “Yes, I should,”--and he answered, “Ah! well, with you\r\nperhaps it is different; you belong to a family that have got a will;”\r\nand I walk, but I walk by the sheer force of _will_.’\r\n\r\n“The Duchess said she remembered old Lady Penrhyn and her pugs, and\r\ntheir being dressed like children, and keeping a footman, and having a\r\nkey of Grosvenor Square.\r\n\r\n“In the evening I drove with Mr. Lowther to Haynes, till lately written\r\nHawnes, the fine old place of Lord John Thynne (Sub-Dean of\r\nWestminster), which he inherited from his uncle, Lord Carteret. We met\r\nthe old man riding in his park, and so much taken up with a sick cow\r\nthat he almost ignored us. But when we had walked round by the charming\r\nold-fashioned gardens, we found him waiting for us on the garden\r\ndoorstep, all courtesy and kindness. Several sons and daughters-in-law\r\ndropped in to tea in a kind of passage-room, but Lord John took me to\r\nsee all the curiosities of the house himself, and warmed up over them\r\ngreatly. There is a most noble staircase and a very fine collection of\r\nfamily portraits. In the drawing-room is that of Lady Ann Carteret in a\r\nwhite satin dress, which she always wore, and is always remembered still\r\nas ‘The White Lady.’ Her husband was Jack Spencer, of whom there is also\r\na fine picture. His grandmother, Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, one day\r\nsaid to him suddenly, ‘Jack, you must marry, and I will give you a list\r\nof the ladies you may propose to.’--‘Very well, grannie,’ he said, and\r\nhe proposed to the first on the list. When he came back with his wife\r\nfrom their wedding tour they went to pay their respects to the old lady.\r\n‘Well, now,’ she said, ‘I am the root and you are only the branches, and\r\ntherefore you must always pay me a great deal of deference.’--‘That is\r\nall very well,’ said Jack impertinently, ‘but I think the branches would\r\nflourish a great deal better if the root was under ground.’\r\n\r\n“There is a great collection of small treasures at Haynes--snuff-boxes\r\nof royal persons, of Lord Chesterfield, &c., and one with a portrait of\r\na lady ancestress,--‘not a good woman, she had nothing but her\r\nbeauty,’--which takes off and puts on a mask. But the great relic of all\r\nis, in its own old shagreen case, the famous Essex ring--a gem\r\nbeautifully set. With it is a most interesting letter from Weigall, the\r\nfamous jeweller, explaining a great number of reasons why it must be\r\n_the_ ring. There is also the pedigree of the ring, which came through\r\nthe hands of a great number of females--heiresses.\r\n\r\n“To-day the Duchess (Dowager of Cleveland) has been talking much of the\r\nwicked Duchess of Gordon, her ancestress. She married all her daughters\r\nto drunken Dukes. One of them had been intended to marry Lord Brome, but\r\nhis father, Lord Cornwallis, objected on account of the insanity in the\r\nGordon family. The Duchess sent for him. ‘I understand that you object\r\nto my daughter marrying your son on account of the insanity in the\r\nGordon family: now I can solemnly assure you that there is not a single\r\ndrop of Gordon blood in her veins.’\r\n\r\n“The Duchess of Cleveland went out walking this morning in beating rain\r\nand bitter wind--blind, broken-kneed, and eighty-four as she is. ‘Well,\r\nyou _are_ a brave woman, Duchess,’ some one said as she came in. ‘You\r\nneed not take the trouble to tell me that: I know that I _am_ a brave\r\nwoman,’ she answered.\r\n\r\n“Old Miss Thornton called--Lady Leven’s sister. She talked much of the\r\nmisuse of charitable funds in dinners to directors, payment of matrons,\r\nex-matrons, &c., and said, ‘There really ought to be a society formed\r\nfor the demolition of charitable institutions.’\r\n\r\n“At dinner the Duchess vehemently inveighed against the deterioration\r\nof the times. ‘Was there ever _anything_ so ridiculous and uncalled-for\r\nas a school-feast?’--‘But it is such a pleasure to the\r\nchildren.’--‘Pleasure to them! In my days people were not always\r\nthinking how children were to be amused. Children were able to amuse\r\nthemselves in my day. It is not only with the lower classes: all classes\r\nare the same--the same utterly demoralising system of indulgence\r\neverywhere. Why are not the children kept at home to learn to wash and\r\nsew and do their duty?’--‘But the school-feast is only one day in the\r\nyear.’--‘One day in the year! Fiddlesticks! don’t tell me. I tell you\r\nit’s utterly demoralising. Why, if the feast is only one day, it\r\nunhinges them for ten days before and ten days after.\r\n\r\n“‘Formerly, too, people knew how to live like gentlemen and ladies. When\r\nthey built houses, they built houses fit to live in, not things in which\r\nthe walls were too thin to allow of the windows having any shutters....\r\nWhy, now people do not even know how to keep a great house. Look at ----,\r\ndo you think she knows it, with her alternate weeks for receiving\r\nvisitors. _That_ is not what ought to be; that is not hospitality. A\r\ngreat house ought to be open always. The master and mistress never ought\r\nto feel it a burthen, and if it was properly managed, they never would.\r\nThere should always be a foundation of guests in the house, a few\r\nrelations or intimate friends, who would be quite at home there, and who\r\nwould be civil and go out to walk or drive, or do whatever might be\r\nnecessary to amuse the others. There ought to be no _gêne_ of any kind,\r\nand there ought to be plenty of _equipages_--that should be quite\r\nindispensable.’\r\n\r\n“The conversation fell upon Rogers the poet. ‘Mr. Rogers came here\r\nonce,’ said Lady Wensleydale, ‘and I did not like him; I thought him so\r\nill-bred. He came with the Duchess of Bedford of that time, who was the\r\nmost good-natured woman in the world, and when he went out into the park\r\nand came in quite late for luncheon, she said he must have some, and\r\nwent into the dining-room herself to see that he had it properly, and\r\nwhile he was eating cold beef, mixed him herself a kind of salad of oil\r\nand vinegar, which she brought to him. He waited a moment, then took up\r\na piece of the beef in his fingers, rolled it in the sauce, and, walking\r\nround the table, popped it into the Duchess’s mouth. She went into the\r\ndrawing-room afterwards and complained to his friend Luttrell about it,\r\n“What can I have done that Mr. Rogers should treat me so?” Luttrell\r\nsaid, “I have known Rogers for sixty years, and have never yet been able\r\nto account for any one of his vagaries.”\r\n\r\n“‘Rogers and Luttrell were great friends, though they always quarrelled.\r\nWhen they walked out together, they never walked side by side, but\r\nalways one behind the other.\r\n\r\n“‘Rogers met Lord Dudley at one of the foreign watering-places, and\r\nbegan in his vain way, “What a terrible thing it is how one’s fame\r\npursues one, and that one can never get away from one’s own identity!\r\nNow I sat by a lady the other night, and she began, ‘I feel sure you\r\nmust be Mr. Rogers.’”--“And _were_ you?” said Lord Dudley, looking up\r\ninto his face quite innocently. It was the greatest snub the poet ever\r\nhad.\r\n\r\n“‘Rogers hated Monckton Milnes. He was too much of a rival. If Milnes\r\nbegan to talk, Rogers would look at him sourly, and say, “Oh, _you_ want\r\nto hold forth, do you?” and then, turning to the rest of the party, “I\r\nam looking for my hat; Mr. Milnes is going to entertain the company.”’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Sept. 1._--I had rather dreaded the _tête-à-tête_ journey\r\nwith the Duchess to-day, and truly it was a long one, for we had an hour\r\nto wait at Ampthill Station, and then missed the express at Bletchley.\r\nWhen we first got into the carriage the Duchess said, ‘Well, now, I am\r\ngoing to be quiet and rest my eyes,’ which I thought was a hint that I\r\nwas to take my book; but very soon she got bored and said, ‘I can’t see,\r\nand am obliged to go on asking the names of the stations for want of\r\nbeing amused;’ so then I was obliged to talk to her all the rest of the\r\nway.\r\n\r\n“At Ampthill she told me how she was going to London to meet Admiral\r\nInglefield, who was going to help her to ‘pick a child out of the\r\ngutter.’ ‘That child,’ she said, ‘will some day be Earl Powlett. Lord\r\nPowlett took a wager that he would run away with the lady-love of one of\r\nhis brother-officers, and he did run away with her; but she made it a\r\ncondition that he should marry her before a Registrar, which he believed\r\nwas illegal, but it was not, and they were really married. Her only\r\nchild, a boy, was brought up in the gutter. His name is Hinton, and he\r\nis presentable,[216] which his wife is not, for she is a figurante at\r\nthe opera; but she gets more than the other danseuses, because she has\r\nthe courage to stand unsupported upon a tight-rope, which the others\r\nhave not. Powlett offered his son £400 if he would go away from England\r\nand never come back again, but he refused, so then he would only give\r\nhim £100. He lives by acting at small theatres, but sometimes he does\r\nnot live, but starves. He had four children, but one is dead. It is the\r\neldest I mean to take away and place with a clergyman and his wife, that\r\nhe may learn something of being a gentleman. I shall undertake him for\r\nthree years, then I shall see what he is likely to be fit for. If I live\r\nso long, I can settle it; if not, I must leave the means for it. Facts\r\nare stranger than fiction.’\r\n\r\n“At the stations, the Duchess was perfectly furious at the bonnets she\r\nsaw. ‘If any respectable persons had gone to sleep twenty years ago and\r\nwoke up now, they would think it was Bedlam let loose.’ She said how\r\nCount Streletski, who had travelled everywhere, said there was no\r\ncountry in which people were satisfied with nature: if tall, they wished\r\nto make themselves short; if short, tall: if they were light, they\r\nwished to be dark, and _vice versâ_. She talked of the peculiarities of\r\nvanity in different people--how the first Lady Westmoreland made the\r\ncoiffeur wait and touch her up when she was _in_ the carriage.\r\n\r\n“The Duchess parted from me at Euston Station, with a cordial invitation\r\nto Osterley.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sept. 27._--I have had a constant succession of visitors at my little\r\nHolmhurst.\r\n\r\n“A singular subject of interest has been Mr. Freeman’s virulent letters\r\nagainst and about me. He seems insane on the subject of creating\r\nimaginary injuries.[217] Certainly it is a little annoying to be called\r\na thief in the public papers, though it may be useful for one’s morals.\r\nHowever, ‘Experience is the best teacher, only the school fees are\r\nheavy.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Conington Castle, Sept. 29._--I came here yesterday to old Mr.\r\nHeathcote’s. It is a low-lying place in the Fens, close to what was once\r\nWhitlesea Mere, but is now drained, only patches of reeds and marshy\r\nground remaining here and there. The house is near the site of an old\r\ncastle, but its only claim to be called a castle itself arises from its\r\nhaving been partly built out of the ruins of Fotheringhay, from which a\r\nrow of arches remain. To ordinary eyes the country is frightful, but Mr.\r\nHeathcote, as an artist, sees much beauty--which really does exist--in\r\nthe long unbroken lines where the mere once was, and the faint blue\r\nshadows in the soft distances. And he has preserved very interesting\r\nmemorials of all that the district has been, within his memory, in an\r\nimmense series of sketches of the mere in summer, and in winter, when\r\ncovered with people skating; and of the mere life--its fisheries, wild\r\nbirds, and its curious draining mills, now all of the past.\r\n\r\n“We have been to draw at Peterborough, a wonderfully foreign-looking\r\ntown, more so, I think, than any other in England. I saw Bishop Jeune’s\r\ngrave: it almost looks old now, and it really is many years since we\r\nlost him; yet, on looking back, the time seems nothing, so quickly does\r\nlife pass, and living become out-living.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sept. 30._--We have been to Hinchinbroke. Lord and Lady Sandwich were\r\nalone. She was the Lady Blanche Egerton[218] of my long ago Chillingham\r\ndays. Lord Sandwich took me all over the pictures. The best is that of\r\nLady Castlemaine, afterwards Duchess of Cleveland, very young and\r\nlovely, with all her hair down. There is also a fine full-length of\r\nCharles II., and a curious picture of Charles II. of Spain by Herrera.\r\nBy Gainsborough there is a beautiful portrait of Miss Martha Ray. Mr.\r\nHackman, who saw her with Lord Sandwich, fell in love with her, and took\r\norders in order to be able to marry her. Afterwards, when he saw her in\r\nCovent Garden receiving the attentions of somebody else, he shot her in\r\na fit of jealousy, and suffered for it at Tyburn. In the ‘Ship Room’ is\r\nan interesting picture by Vanderwelt of the naval action in which the\r\nfirst Lord Sandwich died. His ship was fired by a fireship and blown up,\r\nand he was drowned. Ten days afterwards his body was recovered, and the\r\ngarter and medal found upon it are preserved in a glass case near the\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n“The rooms at Hinchinbroke are very pleasant and livable, but the oldest\r\nparts of the house are burnt and the oak staircase is painted. Near the\r\nfoot of it, the skeletons of two prioresses (for the house was once a\r\nmonastery) were found in their stone coffins, and were buried again in\r\nthe same place! Lord Sandwich showed us the MSS. of the great Lord\r\nSandwich--journals and letters in many volumes; also many letters of\r\nGeorge III., showing his great interest in very minute public matters.\r\nHe has also a splendid collection of Elzevirs.\r\n\r\n“When Lady Sandwich was going to visit a school the next day, Miss Mary\r\nBoyle heard the mistress say, ‘Now, girls, to-morrow my Lady is coming,\r\nand so, recollect, pocket-handkerchiefs must be the order of the day:\r\nthere must be no _sniffling_.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Conington, Oct. 1._--This is one of the clockwork houses, with a\r\nmonotonous routine of life suited to the flat featureless country.\r\nTo-day, after church, the male part of the family set off to walk a\r\ncertain six miles, which they always walk after church, and, when we\r\nreached a certain bridge, the female part said, ‘Here we turn back; this\r\nis the place where we turn every Sunday through the year: we always go\r\nas far as this, and we never go any farther.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sarsden House, Chipping Norton, Oct. 4._--I came here on Monday. At\r\nPaddington Station I met Lady Darnley and Lady Kathleen Bligh, and a\r\nprocession of carriages in waiting showed that a large party was\r\nexpected by the same train. It came dropping in round the five-o’clock\r\ntea-table--Lord and Lady Denbigh; Lord and Lady Aberdare and a daughter;\r\nMr. and Mrs. J. A. Symonds; two young Plunketts; George, Lady Constance,\r\nand Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre; Lord Morton.... I like Lord Denbigh very\r\nmuch, and feel sure that no Roman Catholic plotter would induce him to\r\ndo what he did not believe to be right, or say what he did not believe\r\nto be true.\r\n\r\n“On Tuesday afternoon I drove to Heythorp with Lady Darnley, Lady\r\nDenbigh, and Lady Aberdare. A long unfinished avenue leads up to the\r\nvery stately house, which has been well restored by Albert Brassey.\r\n\r\n“In the evening Lord Denbigh told us:--\r\n\r\n“‘Dr. Playfair, physician at Florence, went to the garden of a villa to\r\nsee some friends of his. Sitting on a seat in the garden, he saw two\r\nladies he knew; between them was a third lady dressed in grey, of very\r\npeculiar appearance. Walking round the seat, Dr. Playfair found it very\r\ndifficult to see her features. In a farther part of the garden he met\r\nanother man he knew. He stayed behind the seat and asked his friend to\r\nwalk round and see if he could make out who the odd-looking lady was.\r\nWhen he came back he said, “Of course I could not make her out, because\r\nwhen I came in front of her, her face was turned towards you.” Dr.\r\nPlayfair then walked up to the ladies, and as he did so, the central\r\nfigure disappeared. The others expressed surprise that Dr. Playfair,\r\nhaving seen them, had not joined them sooner. He asked who the lady was\r\nwho had been sitting between them. They assured him that there had\r\nnever been any such person.\r\n\r\n“‘The next morning, Dr. Playfair went early to see the old gardener of\r\nthe villa, and asked him if there was any tradition about the place. He\r\nsaid, “Yes, there is a story of a lady dressed in grey, who appears once\r\nin every twenty-five years, and the singular part is that she has no\r\nface.” Dr. Playfair asked when she had appeared last. “Well, I remember\r\nperfectly; it was twenty-five years ago, and the time is about coming\r\nround for her to appear again.”’\r\n\r\n“Lord Aberdare said that when Edward Lear was drawing in Albania, he was\r\nin perfect despair over the troops of little ruffians who mobbed him and\r\nwould not go away. Suddenly his india-rubber tumbled down and bobbed\r\ndown some steps--bob-bob-bob. The boys all ran away as hard as they\r\ncould, screaming, ‘Thaitan! Thaitan!’ and never came back again.\r\n\r\n“A delightful old Mrs. Stewart has arrived from Scotland. I sat by her\r\nat dinner. She talked much of Mrs. Grote. She described an interview\r\nMrs. Grote had with Madame George Sand. She said to Madame Sand that it\r\nwas a pity she did not employ her great powers for the leavening and\r\nmellowing of mankind, as Miss Austen had done. ‘Madame,’ said Madame\r\nSand, ‘je ne suis pas philosophe, je ne suis pas moraliste, et je suis\r\nromancière.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 4._--While Madeleine has been drawing my portrait, Mrs. Stewart\r\nhas talked delightfully, contradicting the theory of De Tocqueville that\r\n‘the charming art of conversation--to touch and set in motion a\r\nthousand thoughts without dwelling tiresomely on any one--is amongst the\r\nlost arts, and can only be sought for in History Hut.’[219] She\r\ndescribed her visit to Ober Ammergau. Her anxiety to go was intense, but\r\nall the means seemed to fail. The Princess Mary of Hanover and the Grand\r\nDuchess Elizabeth (to whom she had intended to annex herself) _walked_.\r\nBut, to be in waiting upon them, went Baron Klenck, her Hanoverian\r\nson-in-law, and he came back greatly impressed, and said to his wife\r\nwhen he came in, ‘If thy mother still wishes to go, in God’s name let\r\nher set forth;’ and she went. She described the life at the village--the\r\nsimplicity, the cheapness; then, in the play, the awful agony of the\r\ntwenty minutes of the Crucifixion, the sublimity of the Ascension. ‘I\r\nhave seen hundreds of “ascensions” on the stage and elsewhere, but I\r\nhave never seen anything like that simple _re-presentation_.’\r\n\r\n“At luncheon Mrs. Stewart described a sitting with Mrs. Guppy the\r\nspiritualist. Count Bathyany, her daughter, and others were present.\r\nThey were asked what sort of manifestation they would have. They\r\ndeclared they would be satisfied with nothing less than a ghost. There\r\nwas a round hole in the table with a lid upon it. Presently the lid\r\nbegan to quiver, gradually it was thrown on one side, and a hand came up\r\nviolently agitating itself. ‘Mrs. Guppy said, “Dear spirit” (we are\r\nalways very affectionate you know), “would you like the glass?” and a\r\ngreat tall fern-glass was put over the place: otherwise, I should have\r\ntouched that hand. Then, inside the glass (but we could not touch it,\r\nyou know) came up something wrapped in muslin: Mrs. Guppy said it was a\r\nhead. Afterwards we were asked to go down to supper: there was quite a\r\nhandsome collation. A young American who was with us was so disgusted\r\nwith what he had seen that he would touch nothing--would take neither\r\nbread nor salt in that house. I was weak: I did not quite like to\r\nrefuse, and I ate a few strawberries. Of course, as far as the moral\r\nprotest went, I might as well have eaten a whole plateful. Bathyany made\r\na very good supper. He took a rose away with him for his Countess, for\r\nat the end of our séance quantities of flowers appeared, we knew not\r\nwhence, quite fresh, dewy, beautiful flowers: they appeared on the table\r\nclose to Count Bathyany.\r\n\r\n“‘The spirits are very indulgent. They think we are in better humour if\r\nour spirits are kept up. After I have been sitting there for some time\r\nthey generally say, “Harriet is exhausted; let her have a glass of\r\nwine.” Then sometimes they give us nicknames--beautiful nicknames; my\r\ndaughter they called “Mutability,” and me they named “Distrust.”’\r\n\r\n“We have been a long drive to a charming old house, Chastleton,\r\nbelonging to Miss Whitmore Jones, who lives there alone, ‘le dernier\r\nrejeton de sa famille.’ It is in a hollow with fine old trees around it,\r\nmanor-house, church, arched gateway, and dovecot on arches grouped close\r\ntogether, all of a delicate pink-yellow-grey. Inside is a banqueting\r\nhall with very fine old panelling and curious furniture, and upstairs a\r\nlong gallery and nobly panelled drawing-room.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sarsden, Oct. 5._--Last night Mrs. Stewart talked much of Hanover and\r\nher life there. Her daughter was lady-in-waiting to the Queen. She\r\ndescribed how all the royal family might have their property back at\r\nonce, but the King would make no concession--‘God has given me my crown;\r\nI will only give it back to Him.’\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Stewart was with the Queen and Princess for five months at\r\nHerrenhausen after the King left for Langensalza, when ‘like a knight,\r\nhe desired to be placed in the front of his army, where all his soldiers\r\ncould see him, and where he was not satisfied till he felt the bullets\r\nall whizzing around him.’ The people in Hanover said he had run away.\r\nWhen the Queen heard that, she and Princess Marie went down to the place\r\nand walked about there, and, when the people pressed round her, said,\r\n‘The King is gone with his army to fight for his people; but I am here\r\nto stay with you--to stay with you till he comes back.’ But alas! she\r\ndid not know!\r\n\r\n“All that time in Herrenhausen they were alone: only Mrs. Stewart and\r\nher daughter went out occasionally to bring in the news; the others\r\nnever went out. At last the confinement became most irksome to the\r\nPrincesses. They entreated Mrs. Stewart to persuade mama to let them go\r\nout. Mrs. Stewart urged it to the Queen, who said, ‘But the Princesses\r\nhave all that they need here; they ought to be satisfied.’--‘Pardon me,\r\nyour Majesty,’ said Mrs. Stewart; ‘the Princesses have not all they\r\nneed; it is necessary for young people to have some change.’ ‘So,’ said\r\nMrs. Stewart, ‘at last the Queen saw that it was well, and she\r\nconsented. She said, “We will not take one of our own carriages, that\r\nwould attract too much attention, but we will take Harty’s--that is, my\r\ndaughter’s--carriage, and we will drive in that;” for the Queen had\r\ngiven Harty a little low carriage and a pony. So they set off--the\r\nQueen, Princess Marie, and only the coachman besides. And when they had\r\ngone some way up the hills, the pony fretted under the new traces and\r\nbroke them, and, before they knew where they were, it was away over the\r\nhedges and fields, and they were left in the lane with the broken\r\ncarriage. Two Prussian officers rode up--for the Prussians were already\r\nin Hanover--and seeing two ladies, beautiful ladies too (for the Queen\r\nis still very handsome), in that forlorn state, they dismounted, and,\r\nlike gentlemen as they were, they came up hat in hand, and offered their\r\nassistance. The Queen said, “Oh, thank you; you see what has happened to\r\nus: our coachman has gone after the pony, which has run away, and no\r\ndoubt he will soon come back, so we will just wait his return.” But the\r\ncoachman did not come back, and the gentlemen were so polite, they would\r\nnot go away, so at last the Queen and Princess had to set out to return\r\nhome; and the officers walked with them, never having an idea who they\r\nwere, and never left them till they reached the gates of Herrenhausen.\r\nSo the Queen came in and said, “You see what has happened, my dear; you\r\nsee what a dreadful thing has befallen us: we will none of us ever try\r\ngoing out again,” and we never did.\r\n\r\n“‘We used to go and walk at night in those great gardens of\r\nHerrenhausen, in which the Electress Sophia died. The Queen talked then,\r\nGod bless her, of all her sorrows. We often did not come in till the\r\nmorning, for the Queen could not sleep. But, even in our great sorrow\r\nand misery, Nature would assert herself, and when we came in, we ate up\r\neverything there was. Generally I had something in my room, and the\r\nQueen had generally something in hers, though that was only bread and\r\nstrawberries, and it was not enough for us, for we were so very hungry.\r\n\r\n“‘One night the Queen made an aide-de-camp take the key, and we went to\r\nthe mausoleum in the grounds. I shall never forget that awful walk,\r\nHarty carrying a single lanthorn before us, or the stillness when we\r\nreached the mausoleum, or the white light shining upon it and the\r\nclanging of the door as it opened. And we all went in, and we knelt and\r\nprayed by each of the coffins in turn. The Queen and Princess Marie\r\nknelt in front, and my daughter and I knelt behind; and we prayed--oh!\r\nso earnestly--out of the deep anguish of our sorrow-stricken hearts. And\r\nthen we went up to the upper floor where the statues are. And there lay\r\nthe beautiful Queen, the Princess of Solms, in her still loveliness, and\r\nthere lay the old King, the Duke of Cumberland, with the moonlight\r\nshining on him, wrapped in his military cloak. And when the Queen saw\r\nhim, she, who had been so calm before, sobbed violently and hid herself\r\nagainst me--for she knows that I also have suffered--and said in a voice\r\nof pathos which I can never forget, “Oh, he was so cruel to me, so very,\r\nvery cruel to me.” And after that we walked or lingered on the\r\ngarden-seats till daylight broke.\r\n\r\n“‘The Queen was always longing to go away to her own house at\r\nMarienberg, and at last she went. She never came back; for, as soon as\r\nshe was gone, the Prussians, who had left her alone whilst she was\r\nthere, stepped in and took possession of everything.\r\n\r\n“‘The Queen is a noble, loving woman, but she is more admirable as a\r\nwoman than a queen. I _have_ known her queenly, however. When Count von\r\nWalchenstein, the Prussian commandant, arrived, he desired an interview\r\nwith her Majesty. He behaved very properly, but as he was going away--it\r\nwas partly from gaucherie, I suppose--he said, “I shall take care that\r\nyour Majesty is not interfered with in any way.” Then our Queen rose,\r\nand in queenly simplicity she said, “I never expected it.” He looked so\r\nabashed, but she never flinched; only, when he was gone out of the room,\r\nshe fainted dead away upon the floor.\r\n\r\n“‘The mistake of our Queen has been with regard to the Crown Prince. She\r\nhas had too great motherly anxiety, and has never sent out her son, as\r\nthe Empress Eugenie did, to _learn_ his world by acting in it and by\r\nsuffering in it.”\r\n\r\n“To-day Mrs. Stewart has been talking much of the pain of age, of the\r\ndistress of being now able to do so little for others, of being ‘just a\r\ncreature crawling between heaven and earth.’ She also spoke much of ‘the\r\ncomfort of experience,’ of scarcely anything being quite utterly\r\nirrevocable; that ‘in most things, most crimes even, one can trail,\r\n_trail_ oneself in the dust before God and man.’\r\n\r\n“In the morning Mrs. Stewart sat for her portrait to Madeleine, in her\r\npicturesque square head-dress. She was pleased at being asked to sit.\r\n‘Il faut vieillir être heureuse,’ she said. She talked much whilst she\r\nwas sitting--much of Lady H.’s insolent and often unfeeling sayings. She\r\nspoke of a doctor who had the same inclination, and said to her, ‘Ça ne\r\nme repugne pas de dire les vérités cruelles.’ Talking of self-respect,\r\nshe quoted the maxim of Madame George Sand--\r\n\r\n    ‘Charité envers les autres;\r\n     Sincérité envers Dieu;\r\n     Dignité envers soi-même.’\r\n\r\nAnd added, ‘But who should one be well with if not with oneself, with\r\nwhom one has to live so very much.’\r\n\r\n“This morning Lady Ducie’s pet housemaid gave warning, because, she\r\nsaid, Lady Ducie was not so sympathetic to her as she was six weeks ago.\r\nShe said that as Lady Ducie was now not nearly so nice to her as she had\r\nbeen, she should be obliged to marry a greengrocer who had proposed to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“In the afternoon we drove to Daylesford--Warren Hastings’ so beloved\r\nhome. It is a very pretty place, picturesque modern cottages amid tufted\r\ntrees, and a very beautiful small modern church on a green. This church\r\nwas built by Mr. Grisewood, and supplants a so-called Saxon church,\r\nrestored after a thousand years of use by Warren Hastings. The\r\ninscription commemorating his restoration still remains, and ends with\r\nthe text--‘For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday.’ The\r\ntomb of Warren Hastings, a yellow urn on a pedestal, stands in the\r\nchurchyard just under the east window. He left the place to his wife’s\r\nson by her first husband, Count Imhoff. Lady Ducie remembers Countess\r\nImhoff coming to visit her mother, always with a great deal of state,\r\nand always dressed in white satin and swansdown, like one of Romney’s\r\npictures. Mr. Grisewood succeeded the Imhoffs, and, when his son became\r\na Roman Catholic, sold the place to Mr. Bias. We drove to the house,\r\nwhich stands well--a comfortable yellow stone house in pretty grounds,\r\nwith a clear running stream. Its reminiscences and the power of calling\r\nthem up made Mrs. Stewart speak with great admiration of those who\r\n‘could find the least bit of bone and create a mastodon.’\r\n\r\n“In returning, Mrs. Stewart told the story of Miss Geneviève Ward, the\r\nactress. In early life she was travelling with her mother, when they\r\nfell in with a handsome young Russian, Count Constant Guerra. He\r\nproposed to her, and as the mother urged it, thinking it a good match,\r\nshe married him then and there in her mother’s presence, without\r\nwitnesses, he solemnly promising to make her his wife publicly as soon\r\nas he could. When he could, he refused to fulfil his promise; but the\r\nmother was an energetic woman, and she appealed to the Czar, who forced\r\nGuerra to keep his word. He said he would do what the Czar bade him, but\r\nthat his wife should suffer for it all her life. To his amazement, when\r\nthe day for the marriage arrived, the bride appeared with her mother,\r\nled to the altar in a long crape veil as to a funeral. Her brothers\r\nstood by her with loaded pistols, and at the door of the church was a\r\ncarriage into which she stepped as soon as the ceremony was over, and\r\nhe never saw her again. She is Madame Constant Guerra, and has acted as\r\n‘Guerrabella.’\r\n\r\n“When we came home, I told a story in Lady Ducie’s sitting-room. Then\r\nLord Denbigh told how--\r\n\r\n“‘Sir John Acton (whose son was Lady Granville’s first husband) was a\r\ngreat friend of Lord Nelson, who was at that time occupied in a vain and\r\nhopeless search for the French fleet.[220] One day Sir John was in his\r\nwife’s dressing-room while she was preparing for dinner. As her French\r\nmaid was dressing her, a letter was put into her hand, at which she gave\r\nsuch a start that she ran a pin she was holding into Lady Acton. This\r\ncaused Lady Acton to inquire what ailed her. She said the letter was\r\nfrom her brother, a French sailor, from whom she had not heard for a\r\nlong time, and about whom she had been anxious. Sir John Acton, with\r\ngreat presence of mind, offered to read her the letter while she went on\r\ndoing her mistress’s hair. As soon as he had read it he went off to Lord\r\nNelson. The letter gave all the information so long sought in vain, and\r\nthe battle of the Nile was the result of the prick of a pin.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Prestbury, Oct. 6._--It poured so hard this morning that I put off\r\nleaving Sarsden till late. Mrs. Stewart again talked much of the\r\nHanoverian Court, of the Guelph love of doubtful stories; how she saved\r\nup any story she heard for the blind King. One day she was telling him\r\na story ‘about Margaret Bremer’s father’ as they were driving. Suddenly\r\nthe horses started, and the carriage was evidently going to be upset.\r\n‘Why don’t you go on?’ said the King. ‘Because, sir, we are just going\r\nto upset.’--‘That is the coachman’s affair,’ said the King; ‘do you go\r\non with your story.’\r\n\r\n“With the Greatheeds, in whose cottage I am staying, I went a long\r\nexcursion yesterday up the Cotswold Hills, which have a noble view of\r\nthe great rich plain of Gloucestershire. Winchcombe, on the other side,\r\nis a charming old town of quaint irregular houses. We passed through it\r\nto Hailes Abbey, a small low ruin now, of cloisters in a rich meadow,\r\nbut once most important as containing the great relic of the Precious\r\nBlood, which was brought thither by Edmund, son of the founder, Richard,\r\nKing of the Romans. Thirteen bishops said mass at different altars at\r\nthe consecration, and three of the Plantagenets--the founder, his wife,\r\nand his son Edmund--are buried in the church. It is now a peaceful\r\nsolitude, with a few ancient thatched cottages standing round the wooded\r\npastures.\r\n\r\n“In returning, we turned aside to Sudeley Castle, the old Seymour house,\r\nwhere Katherine Parr is buried. It is a picturesque and grand old house,\r\npartially restored, partly now a green courtyard surrounded by ruined\r\nwalls and arches. The Queen’s (modern) tomb has a touching sleeping\r\nfigure[221] guarded by two angels. As we were coming out of the chapel,\r\nMrs. Dent[222] pursued us--a picturesque figure in a Marie Antoinette\r\nhat--and brought us in to tea. The Dents made their fortunes as glovers,\r\nand, in their present magnificence, a parcel of their gloves, as from\r\nthe shop, is always left in a conspicuous place in the hall, to ‘keep\r\nthem humble.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Tettenhall Wood, Oct. 12._--Whilst with the Corbets at Cheltenham, I\r\nvisited Thirlstone, a curious house which belonged to Lord Northbrook.\r\nIt was afterwards bought by Sir J. Philipps, the bibliomaniac, and\r\ncontains the most enormous and extraordinary collection of books and\r\npictures imaginable; a few gems, but imbedded in masses of rubbish,\r\nwhich the present possessor, Mrs. Fenwick, daughter of the collector, is\r\nforbidden to sell or destroy.\r\n\r\n“I have been working hard for Mrs. Moore at the Memoir of her husband\r\nthe Archdeacon (the object of my visit), and have read through all his\r\nspeeches, &c. I see, however, how impracticable it is to help in work of\r\nthis kind. Mrs. Moore implores me to cut out what should be omitted. I\r\nselect what seems to me utterly trivial and commonplace, and she is\r\nannoyed, saying it comprises the only matters of real importance. She\r\nimplores me to correct her diction and grammar: I do so, and she weeps\r\nbecause her pleasure is destroyed in a work which is no longer her own.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Donington Rectory, Oct. 13._--This is a pleasant place in itself, and\r\nany place would be pleasant within view of the beloved Wrekin.[223] On\r\narriving, I went on at once to Boscobel, and saw the oak which grew from\r\nan acorn of the tree that sheltered Charles II., and in the ancient\r\nhalf-timbered house, the hiding-place under the floor at the top of the\r\nturret-stairs, where the Prince is said to have crouched for forty-eight\r\nhours, with his trap-door concealed by cheeses. Well smothered he must\r\nhave been, if Staffordshire cheeses smelt then as they do now. There is\r\na good portrait of Charles, which he presented to the house after the\r\nRestoration. I went on with Henry de Bunsen to White Ladies, now a low\r\nruin of red walls in a meadow, but entered still by a fine Norman\r\narchway. Inside is a quiet burial-ground for Roman Catholics, amongst\r\nwhose lichen-tinted headstones is that of ‘Mistress Joan, who was called\r\nfriend by Charles II.’--being one of those who assisted in his escape.\r\nBeyond, in Hubble Lane, is the ruin of the Pendrill house. The\r\nPendrills[224] were seven brothers, common labourers, but went up to\r\nLondon and had a pension after the Restoration.\r\n\r\n“We went on to Tong--a glorious church, quite a church of the dead, so\r\nfull of noble tombs of Stanleys and Vernons. Near it, in low-lying lands\r\nwith water, is Tong Castle, the old house of the Durants. The last Mr.\r\nDurant brought in another lady to live with his wife, which she\r\nresented, and she left him. There was a long divorce suit, which they\r\nboth attended every day in coaches and six. Owing to some legal quibble,\r\nhe gained his suit, though the facts against him were well known, and he\r\nwas so delighted at the triumph over his wife that he erected a monument\r\nin honour of his victory on the hill above the castle. The sons all took\r\npart with their mother, and when Mr. Durant was lying in his last\r\nillness, they set barrels of gunpowder surreptitiously under the\r\nmonument, and had a match and train ready. They bribed a groom at the\r\nhouse to ride post-haste with the news as soon as the breath was out of\r\ntheir father’s body; and the news of his death first became known to\r\nthe county by the monument being blown into shivers. The Durants sold\r\nTong to Lord Bradford.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Bretton, Yorkshire, Oct. 30._--I have been here for a very pleasant\r\nweek with a large party of what Lady Margaret (Beaumont) calls her\r\n‘young men and maidens.’ ... There has been nothing especial to narrate,\r\nthough our hostess has entertained the whole party with her\r\nnever-failing charm of conversation and wit.\r\n\r\n“One day I went with Henry Strutt,[225] whom I like much, to Wakefield,\r\nto draw the old chapel on the bridge. What an awful place Wakefield\r\nis--always an inky sky and an inky landscape, and the river literally so\r\ninky that the Mayor went out in a boat, dipped his pen, and wrote a\r\nletter with it to the Commissioners of Nuisances.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Raby Castle, Nov. 1._--I came here on Monday, meeting the delicately\r\nhumorous Mr. Dicky Doyle at Darlington, yet with much fear that there\r\nwere few other guests; but I was relieved to find ‘Eleanor the Good,’\r\nDuchess of Northumberland, seated at the five-o’clock tea-table, and\r\nhave had much pleasant talk with her. She spoke of her absorbing\r\nattachment to Alnwick and the pain it was to leave it; that the things\r\nwhich make the greatest blanks in life are not the greatest griefs, but\r\nthe losses which most affect daily life and habits.... Frederick Stanley\r\nand Lady Constance[226] came in the evening, he very pleasant, and she\r\nalmost more full of laughs than any one I ever saw. Other guests are\r\nColonel and Mrs. Duncombe, young Gage, who will be Lord Gage,[227] and\r\njust before dinner a good-looking youth came in, who turned out to be\r\nPeddie Bennet.[228]\r\n\r\n“Yesterday Lord and Lady Pollington came, and old Lord Strathnairn,\r\nlooking thinner and more of an old dandy than ever.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 3._--Yesterday, while I was walking with the Pollingtons through\r\nthe beech-woods deep in rustling leaves, the castle bell announced the\r\nadvent of guests, and returning, we found the Warwicks and Brooke\r\narrived.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Whitburn Hall, Nov. 7._--There is a great pleasure not only in the\r\naffection, but in the _demonstration_ of affection which one receives\r\nhere. Dear old Lady Williamson, in her beautiful tender old age, wins\r\nall hearts by the patience with which she bears her blindness, and the\r\nsweetness with which she sometimes imagines she sees; and Lady\r\nBarrington’s lovely and lovable old face brings sunshine to all around\r\nit.... In the younger generation, all is hospitality and kindness.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Brancepeth Castle, Nov. 8._--Yesterday I went with Augusta Harrington\r\nto visit Edward[229] and Tunie Liddell in their new home at Jarrow. It\r\nis startling to see how the spirit that animated the early martyrs has\r\ninduced them to exchange competence for penury, and to give up the elms\r\nand flowers and pleasant sunny rooms of the Rectory at Wimpole. Now they\r\nare amidst a teeming population of blackened, foul-mouthed, drunken\r\nroughs, living in miserable rows of dismal houses, in a country where\r\nevery vestige of vegetation is killed by noxious chemical vapours, on\r\nthe edge of a slimy marsh, with a distance of inky sky, and furnaces\r\nvomiting forth volumes of blackest smoke. All nature seems parched and\r\nwrithing under the pollution. Their days are perfectly full of work, and\r\nthey have scarcely ever an evening to themselves.... They said our visit\r\ndid them good, and I shall go again.\r\n\r\n“Edward had been perplexed by an old woman, one of his parishioners,\r\nalways declaring herself to be at least ten years younger than he felt\r\ncertain she must be, yet he did not think she was of the kind who would\r\ntell a lie. At last he found that she dated her age from her baptism.\r\n‘The clergy were not so quick upon us then,’ she said, ‘as they are now;\r\nso my father he just waited till we were all born to have us baptized,\r\nand then had us all done together: there were eleven of us.’\r\n\r\n“I reached this great castle in pitch darkness. It is a magnificent\r\nplace--a huge courtyard and enormous fabric girdled in by tremendous\r\ntowers of Henry III. The staircase is modern, but most of the rooms have\r\nstill the vaulted ceilings of Henry III.’s time, though the arms of the\r\nNevilles, with which they were once painted, are gone now. The beer and\r\nwine cellars, with some cells called dungeons, are very curious. The\r\nbutler pointed out with pride the _black_ cobwebs which hung in festoons\r\nand cover much of the wine, a great deal of which was in the huge\r\nbottles called ‘cocks’ and ‘hens.’ The white cobwebs he had less opinion\r\nof: they are less healthy.\r\n\r\n“Pleasant Lady Haddington[230] and her daughter are here. Lady\r\nBoyne[231] is a most pretty and winning hostess, and her children are\r\nthoroughly well brought up, and take a pleasant easy part in everything.\r\nIn the evenings the whole party dance ‘Durham reels’ in the great hall.\r\n\r\n“It was disappointing to have snow to-day, but there is much to interest\r\nin the house and in the old church of St. Brandon close by, where some\r\ngrand figures of the Nevilles sleep before the altar. The very curious\r\npews and reading-desk of the time of Bishop Cosin were destroyed in a\r\nmutilation of the church under the garb of ‘restoration’ sixteen years\r\nago.\r\n\r\n“There are several curious pictures by Hogarth here, in which the Lord\r\nBoyne of that day is introduced; but the most remarkable is one of Sir\r\nFrancis Dashwood as a monk of Medmenham worshipping a naked woman and\r\nall the good things of life.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Kirklands, Nov. 14._--On Friday I was again at Jarrow, and was warmly\r\nwelcomed by the Edward Liddells. Next morning I went with Edward to the\r\nwonderful old church of the seventh century, where Bede’s chair still\r\nstands under the Saxon arches. All around vegetation is blasted; dead\r\ntrees rear their naked boughs into the black sky, and grimy rushes\r\nvainly endeavour to grow in the poisonous marshes. The very horror of\r\nugliness gives a weird and ghastly interest to the place. Edward finds\r\nendless work, and enjoys the struggle he lives in. As Montalembert says,\r\n‘Ce n’est pas la victoire qui fait le bonheur des nobles cœurs--c’est\r\nle combat.’ His is literally a Christian warfare. If he has spare time,\r\nhe employs it in looking about the streets for drunken men. As he sees\r\nthem come reeling along, he offers to help them, and walks home with\r\nthem clinging to his arm. On the way he draws them out, and having thus\r\nfound out where they live, returns next day, armed with the silly things\r\nthey have let fall, to make them ashamed with. While I was making a\r\nlittle sketch of the church, a wedding party came in, the bridegroom\r\nbeing tipsy. Edward accused him of it, and he confessed at once, saying\r\nthat he had been in such a fright at the ceremony, he had been obliged\r\nto take some spirits to keep his courage up. Edward said he wondered he\r\ncould care for that sort of courage, that was only Dutch courage, real\r\nEnglish courage was the only right sort; and as he supposed he wished\r\nto make his wife happy, that was the sort of courage he must look for;\r\nbut being drunk on the day he married was a bad omen for her happiness.\r\nAnd yet, in the midst of his little scolding, Edward was so charming to\r\nthem all that the whole wedding party were captivated, and an\r\nacquaintance, if not a friendship, was founded. It all showed a power of\r\nwork in the real way to win souls. And--\r\n\r\n    ‘He prayeth best who loveth best\r\n         All things both great and small;\r\n     For the dear God who loveth us,\r\n         He made and loveth all.’[232]\r\n\r\n“I came here by a bitterly cold journey of ten hours through the snow.\r\nThe train went off the line, and we were delayed so late that I had to\r\ndrive all the way from Kelso--a dark bitter drive. Har Elliot[233]\r\nreceived me most warmly, with her little Admiral, and dear old George\r\nLiddell. The place was built by old Mr. Richardson, the Writer to the\r\nSignet, and now belongs to his daughter Joanna. On Sunday afternoon we\r\nwent to Ancrum, the burnt house of Sir William Scott, now being rebuilt\r\nin the old Scotch style; its situation is lovely.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Edinburgh, Nov. 19._--I have been four days at Winton with dear old\r\nLady Ruthven. She is now blind as well as deaf, and very helpless, but\r\nshe is still a loving centre of beautiful and unstinted beneficence.\r\nShe says, ‘It is a great trial, a very great trial, neither to see nor\r\nhear, but it is astonishing the amount of time it gives one for good\r\nthoughts. I just know fifty chapters of the Bible by heart, and when I\r\nsay them to myself in the night, it soothes and quiets me, however great\r\nthe pain and restlessness. It is often a little trial to me--the\r\nunsatisfied longing I have to know just a little more, just _something_\r\nof the beyond. If I could only find out if my husband and my sister knew\r\nabout me. There is a little poem I often think of--\r\n\r\n    ‘The soul’s dark cottage, battered and decayed,\r\n     Lets in new light through chinks that time has made.’[234]\r\n\r\nPerhaps it will be so with me; but soon I shall know all, and meantime\r\nGod is very good. Since my last great illness I have not been able for\r\nit, but till then I just always went on reading prayers to my servants,\r\nthat is, I could not really read, you know, but I just _said_ a chapter\r\nout of my own remembrance, and then I prayed as I felt we needed.’\r\n\r\n“Lady Ruthven can repeat whole cantos of Milton and other poets, and her\r\npeculiar voice does not spoil them; rather, when one remembers her great\r\nage and goodness, it adds an indescribable pathos. She likes to be read\r\nto down her trumpet, which is not easy; and the person she hears best\r\nthus is George the under-footman; but, as she says, she ‘has formidable\r\nrivals in lamps.’\r\n\r\n“One of her occupations is feeding her pheasants with bread and milk at\r\nthe castle door. ‘Ah! I see you are early accustoming them to bread\r\nsauce,’ said Mr. Reeve of the _Edinburgh Review_, when he saw her thus\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n“One day we drove to Yester (Lord Tweeddale’s), only remarkable for its\r\npretty wooded approach. In leaving Lady Ruthven, one could not but feel\r\none left her for the last time, and _what_ for her the change--which at\r\nninety must be so near--will be, from blindness, deafness, helplessness,\r\nafter her entirely noble and holy life--to light, and hearing, and\r\npower.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Edinburgh, Nov. 20._--A visit to the Robert Shaw Stewarts has given me\r\na pleasant glimpse of Edinburgh society.\r\n\r\n“Certainly Edinburgh is gloriously beautiful, but never was there a city\r\nso richly endowed by Nature contaminated by such abject and ludicrous\r\npublic monuments!--the enormous monument of Walter Scott, a ludicrous\r\ncopy in stone of the Bishop’s throne at Exeter: the sort of lighthouse\r\nwhich closes Princes Street (a monument to Lord Nelson, I was told): the\r\nstatue of the Duke of Wellington, who has lost his hat in a perfectly\r\nfutile struggle with his restive horse, which is standing on its\r\ntail:--worst of all, the figure of the Prince Consort (in Charlotte\r\nSquare), being adorned by specimens of each class of society, the most\r\nridiculous of all being a peer and peeress in their robes.\r\n\r\n“This morning I drew in the Grassmarket. The crowd was most tiresome\r\ntill it took the idea that I was Sir Noel Paton, the popular Edinburgh\r\nartist. I tacitly encouraged the idea, when I found the result\r\nwas--‘Dinna ye see it’s Sir Noel Paton hissel drawing the cassel? then\r\nlet Sir Noel see, mon.’\r\n\r\n“In the afternoon I went with Mrs. Stewart to the exhibition of\r\nRaeburn’s pictures--nothing but Raeburns, though many vast rooms are\r\nfilled with them; and deeply interesting it is thus not only to follow\r\none great, too little appreciated, painter through life, but to be\r\nintroduced to the whole world of his illustrious contemporaries.\r\nRaeburn’s pictures may be slight, and may have faults of colouring, and\r\neven of drawing, but his men never fail to be gentlemen and his women\r\nare always ladies--very pleasant people too generally, and people it is\r\ndelightful to live with. ‘A great portrait should be liker than the\r\noriginal,’ wrote Coleridge. The noblest portrait here seemed to me to be\r\nthat of Alexander Adam, Rector of the High School, a serious and holy,\r\nbut engaging old man. Lady Mackenzie of Coul is a sweet, refined, and\r\nbeautiful woman. As a rule, the old men’s portraits are the best--their\r\nshaggy eyebrows, their vigorous old age, the sharp shadows of their\r\nchins, so vividly and carefully drawn, and all the _delicacies_ of\r\nexpression centred in the eyes. There were numbers of such old men’s\r\nportraits, in which the dead grandfather must still often seem to share\r\nthe inner family life of many a quiet country-house. It shows the\r\nextraordinary change in the value popular feeling places upon art when\r\none recollects that the works of Watts and Millais cost from £2000 to\r\n£3000, while these pictures--far more pleasing, far more like those they\r\nrepresent, and, though more sketchy, cleverer and more original--used to\r\ncost only £10.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 21._--We have been out to New Hailes, the old Dalrymple house,\r\nnow inhabited by Lord Shand. The characteristic of the house is its\r\nlibrary, which, however, is rather useless, as the bookcases are\r\nseventeen feet high, and there is no ladder to reach the upper shelves\r\nby.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 22._--Excursion to Pinkie, the fine old house of the Hopes, near\r\nMusselburgh--crenellated, machicolated, picturesque as possible. Charles\r\nEdward slept there when triumphant from Prestonpans. There is a noble\r\ngallery upstairs with a painted ceiling, and a secret passage and\r\nstaircase. Lady Hope was very kind.[235]\r\n\r\n“In Edinburgh I have been, for the first time, received as a sort of\r\nmild literary lion, and have found it very amusing. A quantity of people\r\ncame to call--professors, the bishop, and others.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Ravensworth Castle, Nov. 26._--I have been much enjoying a visit here,\r\nand the cordial affection which abounds in my dear Liddell cousins. Old\r\nGeneral Stanhope[236] is here, and told us--\r\n\r\n“‘A gentleman was riding over the Yorkshire Wolds late in the gloaming,\r\nwhen his horse started at something. With the perseverance of a good\r\nrider, he forced the horse to return to the spot where he had started,\r\nwhen he saw with horror that he had been frightened by a dead body,\r\nevidently of a murdered man, lying by the side of the road. A dog was\r\nsitting by the body, and as he rode up it ran away.\r\n\r\n“‘Without losing his presence of mind for an instant, without thought of\r\nlingering to hunt up police, &c., the rider set spurs to his horse and\r\npursued the dog. He pursued it a great distance, and eventually saw it\r\nenter a low solitary public-house.\r\n\r\n“‘He then put his horse into the wretched stable of the place and\r\nentered the house. In the brick kitchen three men were drinking, one man\r\nby himself, two men together; curled up by the fire was the dog.\r\n\r\n“‘The rider called for beer or whisky and sat down. Meanwhile he\r\nobserved his companions. The two men talked together of quite\r\nindifferent subjects; the solitary man said nothing. At last the\r\ngentleman got up and gave the dog a great kick. It ran to the lonely\r\nman, who said in a fury, “What do you mean, sir, by kicking my dog?”--“I\r\nmean that I chose to do it,” he replied; “and furthermore, I mean that I\r\narrest you for murder, and I call upon _you_ (turning to the other two\r\nmen) to assist me in arresting this murderer.”\r\n\r\n“‘And the man confessed.’\r\n\r\n“General Stanhope also gave an interesting account of how old Lord\r\nBraybrooke, going to a farm to see some cows, was struck by something in\r\none of the farming men. At last, suddenly slapping him on the shoulder,\r\nhe exclaimed, ‘Good God! you are De Bruhl!’ and it was a man who had\r\nbeen well known in the world, son of the Bruhl of the famous Terrace at\r\nDresden, the friend of Augustus of Saxony, who had been ruined by the\r\nPrince Regent, and had sunk lower and lower, till he came to be a farm\r\nlabourer, unrecognised and unnoticed for years.\r\n\r\n“Talking of dreams, General Stanhope said--\r\n\r\n“‘Lady Andover, who was the daughter of Lord Leicester, was with her\r\nhusband[237] at Holkham, and when one day all the other men were going\r\nout shooting, she piteously implored him not to go, saying that she had\r\ndreamt vividly that he would be shot if he went out. She was so terribly\r\neager about it, that he acceded to her wishes, and remained with her in\r\nher painting-room, for she painted beautifully in oils, and was copying\r\na picture of the “Misers” which was at Holkham. But the afternoon was\r\nexcessively beautiful, and Lady Andover’s strong impression, which had\r\nbeen so vivid in the morning, then seemed to wear off, till at last she\r\nsaid, “Well, really, perhaps I have been selfish in keeping you from\r\nwhat you like so much because of my own impressions; so now, if you care\r\nabout going out, don’t let me keep you in any longer.” And he said,\r\n“Well, if _you_ don’t mind, I should certainly like to go,” and he went.\r\n\r\n“‘He had not been gone long before Lady Andover’s impression returned\r\njust as vividly as ever, and she rushed upstairs and put on her bonnet\r\nand pursued him. But, as she crossed the park, she met her husband’s own\r\nservant riding furiously without his coat. “Don’t tell me,” she said at\r\nonce; “I know what has happened,” and she went back, and locked herself\r\ninto her room. His servant was handing him a gun through a hedge, it\r\nwent off, and he was killed upon the spot.’\r\n\r\n“‘The same Lady Andover had a dream of a minor kind which came curiously\r\ntrue. She said to her sister that she had dreamt most vividly that she\r\nwas standing with her under the portico at Holkham; that they were both\r\ndressed in deep mourning--thick black bombazine; and that they were\r\nwatching a great funeral leave the house, but that it was not going in\r\nthe natural direction of the churchyard, but the other way, up the\r\navenue.\r\n\r\n“‘A month after, the two sisters were standing under the portico,\r\ndressed in deep mourning for old Queen Charlotte, and the funeral of\r\nLady Albemarle, who had died in the house, was going away up the avenue.\r\nLady Andover said to her sister, “Don’t you remember?”’\r\n\r\n“Apropos of second sight, General Stanhope said--\r\n\r\n“‘Did you ever hear of a man they used to call Houghy White? When I was\r\nyoung, I went with him down to Richmond on a water-party, which was\r\ngiven by Sir George Warrender. Houghy was then engaged to be married to\r\na niece of Beau Brummel, as he was called, and when we returned from\r\nRichmond, we went to spend the evening at her mother’s house, and there\r\nHoughy told this story.\r\n\r\n“‘He was aide-de-camp to the old Duke of Cambridge when he was in\r\nHanover, and was required by the Duke to go with him on a shooting-party\r\ninto the Hartz Mountains. He, and indeed two of the Duke’s other\r\naides-de-camp, were then, I am sorry to say, very much in love with the\r\nwife of a fourth--a very beautiful young lady--and they were all much\r\noccupied by thoughts of her. At the place in the Hartz to which they\r\nwent, there was not much accommodation, but there was one good room with\r\nan alcove in it and four beds. The two German equerries slept in the\r\nalcove, and the two English aides-de-camp in two beds outside it. In the\r\nnight White distinctly saw the lady they all so much admired come into\r\nthe room. She came up to both of the beds outside the alcove and looked\r\ninto them; then she passed into the alcove. He immediately heard the\r\nequerry on the right cry out “Was haben sie gesehn?” and the other--the\r\nhusband--say, “Ach Gott! Ich habe meine Frau gesehn?”\r\n\r\n“‘White was terribly impressed, and the next day entreated to excuse\r\nhimself from going out shooting with the Duke. The Duke insisted on\r\nknowing his reason, upon which he told what he had seen, and expressed\r\nhis conviction that his friend was dead. The Duke was very much annoyed,\r\nand said, “You are really, as a matter of fact, so much occupied with\r\nthis lady that you neglect your duties to me: I brought you here to\r\nshoot with me, and now, on account of whimsical fancies, you refuse to\r\ngo: but I insist upon your going.” However, White continued to say, “I\r\nmust most humbly beg your Royal Highness to excuse me, but I cannot and\r\nwill not go out shooting to-day,” and at last he was left at home. That\r\nevening, the mail came in while they were at dinner, and the letters\r\nwere handed to the Duke. He opened them, and beckoned White to him.\r\n“You were quite right,” he said; “the lady died last night.”’\r\n\r\n“Lizzie Williamson said:--\r\n\r\n“‘I remember quite well how a very charming young surgeon came into this\r\nneighbourhood, a Mr. Stirling; he was beloved by everybody, and though\r\nhe was as poor as a church-mouse, he had not an enemy in the world.\r\nAfter his medical rounds, he was in the habit of riding home through a\r\nlovely wooded lane which there is near Gibside, with trees on each side\r\nand the river below. One day--one Friday--as he was riding home this\r\nway, he was shot by some men concealed amongst the bushes. His body was\r\ndragged into the wood and was searched and rifled; but he was very poor,\r\ndear man; he had nothing but his watch, and the brutes took that: and\r\nthat is all I have to say about him.\r\n\r\n“‘On the night before, the wife of Mr. Bowes’s agent, who was in the\r\nhabit of going every week to receive money at the lead-mines, some miles\r\ndistant from Gibside, awoke dreadfully agitated. She told her husband\r\nthat she had had a most terrible dream, and conjured him, as he loved\r\nher, to stay at home that day, and not to go to the mines. She said she\r\ndid not know the place herself, but she saw a wooded lane above a river\r\nand some men hiding in bushes, and she saw him come riding along, and\r\nthe men shoot at him from behind, and drag him into the bushes. He\r\nlaughed at her, and said of course he could not neglect his duty to his\r\nmaster for such an idle fancy as that, and that he must go to the mines.\r\n\r\n“‘She fell asleep again, and she dreamt the same thing, and she\r\nurgently entreated and implored him not to go. He said, “I must; the men\r\nwill be expecting me; they are to meet me there, and I have really no\r\nexcuse to give.”\r\n\r\n“‘She fell asleep the third time, and she dreamt the same thing, and\r\nawoke with agonised entreaties that her husband would accede to her\r\nwishes. Then he really began to be frightened himself, and at last he\r\nsaid he would make a concession; he would go to the mines, but he would\r\nnot go by the wooded lane at all (for he was obliged to allow there was\r\nsuch a place), but would both go and return by the high moorland way on\r\nthe other side the river.\r\n\r\n“‘So the agent was saved and the poor young surgeon was murdered in his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n“‘The watch which had been taken was found afterwards in a pawnbroker’s\r\nat Durham, and the men who pawned it were traced and taken: Cain and\r\nRain were their odd names. In the hand of the murdered man was found a\r\nbutton of pink glass, imitation amethyst, which exactly matched those on\r\nCain’s waistcoat, with a bit of the stuff hanging to it, as if the dead\r\nman’s hand had clenched it in a struggle. But Cain’s friends got hold of\r\nthe discovery, and sowed the wood with similar pink buttons, which were\r\nfound; so _that_ evidence went for nothing and Cain got off, but every\r\none believed that he and Rain did it.\r\n\r\n“‘Years afterwards, Cain was ill and sent for Harry,[238] and confided a\r\nsecret to him under strict vows of secrecy, and no one knows what that\r\nsecret was.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Kinmel, Nov. 30._--I left Ravensworth early on Monday to go to Ridley\r\nHall. In a few minutes after arriving, White the butler came to say that\r\nCousin Susan would see me. She was in her little sitting-room, half\r\nsitting up on her sofa before an immense fire. At above eighty, her face\r\nand figure have still the look of youth which they had at thirty-five,\r\nand that quite unaided by art, though not by dress. She has now quite\r\nlost the use of her feet, and is cut off from all her usual employments,\r\nher garden, her walks, her china, and, if it were not that she is so\r\nlong inured to solitary habits, her life would be indeed most desolate.\r\nShe talked all afternoon and evening, chiefly about Tyneside politics or\r\nfamily reminiscences. She asked me whom _I_ thought she had better leave\r\nher fortune to. I said, ‘After Mr. Bowes, to one of the Strathmore\r\nboys.’ She would not take leave of me at night, pretending she should\r\nsee me next day, but I knew then that she did not mean to do it. She\r\nsaid, as I went out, ‘You may think that you have given me _one_ happy\r\nday.’\r\n\r\n“I slept at Chester on Tuesday, and walked round the walls by moonlight,\r\nmost picturesque and desolate, with only the tramp of an occasional\r\nwanderer making the night more silent by its echoes.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday I came here. A beautiful ascent through woods leads from the\r\nseaboard to this house, magnificent in the style of a Louis XIV. château\r\nexternally, with Morris paper and colour inside. There is a man party\r\nhere--Lord Colville, Sir Dudley Marjoribanks, Lord de Lisle, Hedworth\r\nWilliamson, Lord Delamere. Hedworth is most amusing, and Lord de Lisle\r\nnot without a quaint humour.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 1._--To-day being a hunting day, most of the men breakfasted in\r\npink in the hall. We drove with the Harringtons to the old Shipley house\r\nof Bodryddan,[239] where young Mrs. Conwy received us. The fine old\r\nhouse has been altered by Nesfield--‘restored’ they call it--but, though\r\nwell done in its way, the quaint old peculiar character is gone. This\r\ngeneration, too, has sent its predecessors into absolute oblivion. Only\r\nthe pictures keep the past alive at all, and they very little. There was\r\na lovely portrait of a little girl with a dog in Mrs. Conwy’s\r\nsitting-room. ‘Who was it?’ I asked. ‘Oh, somebody, some sort of\r\ngreat-aunt,’ she supposed, ‘the dog was rather nice.’ It was Amelia\r\nSloper,[240] Dean Shipley’s most cherished niece, the idol of that house\r\nand of all that lived in it in a past generation. One could not help\r\nremembering how that child’s little footsteps were once the sweetest\r\nmusic that house ever knew, and now her very existence is forgotten\r\nthere, but her picture is preserved because ‘she had rather a nice\r\nlittle dog.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Tatton Park, Dec. 2._--This is a very pleasant, roomy country-house in\r\nan ugly park. The great feature is the conservatories, in one of which a\r\ngravel walk winds between banks of rock and moss and groves of tree-fern\r\nlike a scene in Tasmania.\r\n\r\n“Lady Egerton[241] shows to great advantage in her own house. On small\r\nsubjects her conversation is frivolous, but on deeper subjects she has\r\nacute observation and a capital manner of hitting the right nail on the\r\nhead, and she certainly gives her opinion without respect of persons.\r\nYesterday, Wilbraham Egerton and Lady Mary[242] dined, the latter most\r\nattractive. Lady Egerton was very amusing, especially about old Lady\r\nShaftesbury and her having ‘established a lying-in hospital for cats.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 4._--Yesterday we went to church at Rostherne. Going through the\r\npark gates, Mrs. Mitford (Emily Egerton) told the story of Dick\r\nTurpin--whose propensities were not known to his neighbours, and who\r\nconstantly dined with her grandfather--having been terrified at that\r\ngate one night as he rode away, by thinking that he saw the ghost of one\r\nof his victims, and that it was believed to be haunted ever since.\r\n\r\n“Rostherne Church stands on a terrace above the mere, into which one of\r\nits bells is said to have slipped down, and a mermaid is supposed to\r\ncome up and ring it whenever one of the family at Tatton is going to\r\ndie. It is the most poetical legend in Cheshire. Old Mrs. Egerton[243]\r\ntold it one day at dinner. A short time after, the butler rushed into\r\nthe drawing-room, and begged the gentlemen of the house to come and\r\ninterfere, for two of the under-servants were murdering one another.\r\nMrs. Egerton’s special footman had told the story of the mermaid in the\r\nservants’ hall, and another servant denied it. The footman declared that\r\nit was impossible it should not be true, for his mistress had said it,\r\nand a desperate fight ensued.\r\n\r\n“Miss Wilbraham[244] is here from Blyth--a most pleasant, easy, natural\r\nperson, who draws beautifully, and makes herself most agreeable.\r\n\r\n“To-day we have been to luncheon at Arley. It is a noble house, raised\r\nby the present Mr. Warburton[245] on the site of an old moated building,\r\nwhich was, however, spoilt before his time. In front is a leaden statue\r\nof a Moor, like those at Knowsley and Clement’s Inn. The blind Mr.\r\nWarburton wrote the well-known hunting songs. He lived through his eyes,\r\nbut bears the loss of them with a noble cheerfulness. All around are\r\ndevoted to him, not only his own family, but tenants and workmen, and it\r\nis a touching proof of this, that, when anything new is to be\r\nconstructed, the workmen always make a ‘blind plan’ of it, that he may\r\nfeel and know it--a bit of wood representing one kind of wall, a ridge\r\nof sealing wax another: and so he is still the adviser and soul of it\r\nall.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Gladstone is an old friend of his, and, with silence as to\r\npolitics, was come to cheer and amuse him.\r\n\r\n“Lady Egerton was most comical with Mr. Gladstone. ‘I told you you would\r\nnever rest,’ she said; ‘how could you be so stupid as to think it? A man\r\nwith brains cannot rest. Now how can you have come to do such a number\r\nof foolish things? However, if I was you, I would quiet down: indeed I\r\ndo not despair of you yet.’ At luncheon Mr. Gladstone said she did a\r\ngood deal of work in a very short time, for she totally demolished the\r\nBoard of Education and the Church of England, and eventually established\r\nthe Pope as the head of Christianity throughout the world.\r\n\r\n“Before luncheon, Mr. Warburton took me away to see some prints in the\r\nlibrary. We found there a Mr. Yates, a clergyman, and there was a most\r\nanimated and interesting conversation between him and Mr. Gladstone on\r\nthe logical difference between ‘Obedience’ and ‘Submission,’ which Mr.\r\nYates considered to be the same and I thought so too, but quite see from\r\nMr. Gladstone’s explanation that it is not so. He illustrated it by\r\nStrossmeyer, who was quite willing to _submit_ to the doctrine of Papal\r\ninfallibility, but turned restive at _obedience_, which involved\r\nsubscription, and prevented any power of antagonistic action on his own\r\nfaith any more. They spoke much of obedience to the decrees of a judge\r\nin Church matters. Mr. Gladstone said that while clergy were bound to\r\n_submit_ to a judge’s decree, and while they had no right to inquire his\r\nreasons (two judges often arriving at the same decision from perfectly\r\ndifferent reasons), he did not see why they might not state that the\r\nviews they maintained, according to their own conscience, were at\r\nvariance with the decision, though, as members of the Church of England,\r\nthey were bound to submit to it.\r\n\r\n“Altogether, it was a very interesting visit, and I was glad Mr.\r\nGladstone said he wished it had not been such a short one. He and Mrs.\r\nGladstone were both most cordial.\r\n\r\n“Here, at Tatton, is a number of pictures set into panels round the\r\nstaircase, full-lengths of Cheshire gentlemen, moved hither from Astbury\r\nHall, where the originals met to decide whether they should rise for\r\nPrince Charlie, and finally elected not to risk their estates. In the\r\ndining-room is a picture of a hand shaking out an empty purse by Rubens,\r\nsigned; it was sent to Charles V. when he had forgotten to pay the\r\npainter for his work, to remind him. Lord Egerton has many charming\r\nminiatures in his room, and--a gift to one of his ancestors--Queen\r\nElizabeth’s ‘horn-book,’ being the alphabet and the Lord’s Prayer set in\r\na frame of silver filagree and covered with talc (horn). He told us of\r\nsome one who, wishing effectually to protect his land from poachers, put\r\nup--‘Aspleniums and Polypodiums always on these premises.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 6._--Yesterday we drove to Wythenshawe.[246] It is a most\r\nengaging old house, very well restored, all the historical points\r\nretained--the low narrow door inside the other, through which the\r\ndefenders forced the conquerors to pass as their condition of surrender\r\nafter their siege by the Commonwealth, when the family was heavily\r\nfined: the ghost-room, where a soldier shot in the siege still appears:\r\nthe difference in the panelling of the oak drawing-room, where the\r\npanels were smashed in by a cannon-ball. There is another ghost--a\r\nghastly face of a lady, who draws the curtains and looks in upon a\r\nbride on the first night she sleeps in the house after her marriage: the\r\nlate Mrs. Tatton saw it.”[247]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Betton House, Dec. 9._--Wednesday morning was lovely. We drove to\r\nRostherne Manor, Lady Mary Egerton’s charming modern house, with a\r\nlovely view over the wide shining mere to the Derbyshire hills; on the\r\nright, the church tower on a wooded hill, and in the foreground the\r\nterraced garden with an old leaden figure of Mercury.\r\n\r\n“I came away to Hodnet, where the great new house perfectly swarmed with\r\nHeber Percy cousins, and next morning I went with Ethel Hood to Stoke.\r\nThere is nothing but the ghost of our memories there now--even the\r\nchurch pulled down, all that made the place touching or beautiful to us\r\nswept away.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Betton, Dec. 10._--It has been a great pleasure to go to church with\r\nthe Tayleurs at dear old Market Drayton, and to sit in the great green\r\nbaize room in the family gallery, with a large fire burning in an open\r\nhearth--a pleasant contrast to the wretched open seats which are the\r\nfashion now, though it might recall the exclamation of a Frenchman on\r\nseeing a similar pew--‘Pardi! on sert Dieu bien à son aise ici.’ Yet\r\neven at Drayton the respectable red-cloaked singers have given place to\r\nbawling choristers.\r\n\r\n“I always feel, in the neighbourhood of the winding Terne, as if I were\r\ncarried back into my child-life with my dear adopted grandparents, the\r\none happy part of my boyhood, so different from the many bitter days at\r\nHurstmonceaux.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sherborne Park, Dec. 12._--At Bourton-on-the-Water were many people\r\nwaiting. In the dark I recognised Lord and Lady Denbigh, and then a\r\nyoung lady came up with her husband and spoke to me. ‘I cannot see in\r\nthe least who you are.’--‘Oh, then I shall leave you to guess, and you\r\nwill find out by-and-by.’ It was Sir Garnet and Lady Wolseley. With him\r\nand Lord Powerscourt, and a fat old gentleman much muffled up, whom I\r\ntook for Sir Hastings Doyle, and who turned out to be Mr. Alfred\r\nDenison, I travelled in a carriage to Sherborne. It is a very fine house\r\nof Inigo Jones, of rich yellow stone, with short fluted columns between\r\nthe windows; but in effect it is overwhelmed by the church, which is\r\nclose upon it, and crushes it with its spire. The living rooms are\r\ndelightfully large, airy, and filled with books, flowers, and pictures.\r\n\r\n“I had a pleasant dinner, seated by Mr. Denison, who told me much about\r\nhis curious collection of books on angling, of which he has some of the\r\nearly part of the fifteenth century, and about 500 editions of Izaak\r\nWalton. He has even a Latin treatise on the Devil’s fishery for souls.\r\nHe was just come from Chatsworth, and had seen there a volume for which\r\n£12,000 had been refused, the original of Claude’s ‘Liber Veritatis.’\r\n\r\n“Lord Sherborne is both very fond and very proud of his wife, but her\r\nmusic he pretends to detest, though her singing is quite lovely--not\r\nmuch voice, but intense pathos and expression.\r\n\r\n“This afternoon I have been with Miss Dutton and charming Miss Ruth\r\nBouverie to the old chase and the deer-park, in which there is a\r\nbeautiful deserted hunting-lodge by Inigo Jones. Lady Sherborne wanted\r\nto make a garden in front of it, but was only allowed by her lord to\r\nhave grass instead of potatoes. We also went into the church adjoining\r\nthe house, which contains many family monuments. The most remarkable is\r\nthat of John Dutton, who was ‘possessed of large estate and of mind\r\næquall to his fortune;’ yet he lost a great part of his estates by\r\ngambling, and staked Sherborne too, and would have lost it if he had not\r\nbeen carried off to bed by his butler.\r\n\r\n“Speaking of concealment of the whole truth, Miss Dutton related a story\r\nher uncle, John Dutton, used to tell of the French governess sliding on\r\nthe ice, when one of the children said to her, ‘Mr. Lentil said,\r\nMademoiselle, that he hoped the boys would trip you up upon the ice, and\r\nI really could not tell you what Mr. Davis said.’ Mr. Davis had said\r\n_nothing_, but the intended impression was conveyed.\r\n\r\n“I forget how, apropos of Bible ignorance, Miss Dutton told of an\r\nAmerican, who, entering a coffee-house at New York, saw a Jew there, and\r\nseized him violently by the throat. ‘What, wh--at do you do that for!’\r\nexclaimed the nigh strangled Jew.--‘Because you crucified my\r\nLord.’--‘But all that happened more than 1800 years ago.’--‘That does\r\nnot matter; I have only just heard of it.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 14._--Yesterday we went to Biberry, a beautiful old house of Lord\r\nSherborne’s. Mr. and Lady Augusta Noel joined the party in the evening,\r\nshe a Keppel,[248] the authoress of ‘Wandering Willie,’ and very\r\npleasant. Several neighbours came to dinner. The astronomical\r\nconversation of Mr. Noel was very engaging. I deduced from it that the\r\nflames in the sun were 96,000 miles long, and that we were all liable to\r\nmeet our end in three ways--_i.e._, by going fizz if a particle of the\r\nsun (‘as big as this room’) broke off and struck the earth in any\r\ndirection: by being slowly consumed, the pools drying and the trees\r\nshrivelling up: or by being gradually frozen under an ice-wave. The\r\nearth has already perished once by the last-named contingency, and there\r\nare geological features, especially at Lord Lansdowne’s place in\r\nIreland, which prove it.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Osterley, Dec. 16._--I came here about tea-time to what Horace Walpole\r\ncalls ‘the Palace of Palaces.’ It is a magnificent house. Sir Thomas\r\nGresham was the original builder, and entertained Queen Elizabeth here.\r\nThen it passed through various hands till it fell to the Childs, for\r\nwhom it was partially rebuilt and splendidly fitted up by the brothers\r\nAdam. An immense flight of steps leads through an open portico to a\r\nthree-sided court, beneath which is the basement storey, and from which\r\nopen the hall and the principal rooms. There is a gallery like that at\r\nTemple Newsam, but much longer and finer, and in this case it is broken\r\nand partitioned by bookcases into pleasant corners--almost separate\r\nrooms. The walls and ceilings are ornamented with paintings (let in) by\r\nZucchi and Angelica Kauffmann, but the great charm lies in the\r\nmarvellous variety, delicacy, and simplicity of the wood carvings, each\r\nshutter and cornice a different design, but a single piece. In one room\r\nare exquisite pink Gobelins, the chairs quite lovely; one of them\r\nrepresents a little girl crying over the empty cage of her lost bird; on\r\nits companion a little boy has caught the bird and is rushing to restore\r\nit to her. There is a fine picture of Lady Westmoreland, Robert Child’s\r\ndaughter. When Lord Westmoreland, whom he considered a hopeless\r\nne’er-do-weel, asked for her hand, he had firmly refused it; but when\r\nLord Westmoreland some time after took him unawares with the question,\r\n‘Now, if you were in love with a beautiful girl, and her father would\r\nnot consent to your marrying her, what would you do?’ answered, ‘Run\r\naway with her, to be sure.’ Lord Westmoreland took him at his word, and\r\neloped with Miss Child in a coach-and-four from Berkeley Square; and\r\nwhen, near Gretna Green, he saw that the horses of his father-in-law, in\r\nhot pursuit, were gaining upon him, he stood up in the carriage and shot\r\nthe leader dead, and so gained his bride.\r\n\r\n“The Duchess Caroline (of Cleveland) was often here with Lady Jersey,\r\nand, when she sold her own place of Downham, determined to rent\r\nOsterley. Since then, though only a tenant, she has cared for it far\r\nmore than its owner, Lord Jersey, and has done much to beautify and keep\r\nit up. Only Miss Newton and Mr. Spencer Lyttelton[249] are here, the\r\nlatter with tremendous spirits, which carry him he knows not where. The\r\nDuchess is very amusing. Ordering a very good fire to be made up in\r\nchurch, she added drily to the servant, ‘Just such a fire as you make up\r\non a very hot day, you know.’ She mentioned a clever _mot_ of Count\r\nNesselrode. Speaking of Sir William Wallace’s marriage he said, ‘Il\r\navait une mauvaise habitude, et depuis il a épousé cette habitude.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 17._--The Duchess is a most interesting remnant of bygone times.\r\nShe is so easily put out by any one doing too much, that every one at\r\nluncheon was afraid to get up and ring the bell for her, till she was\r\nclose to the bell herself, when a nervous young man jumped up and rang\r\nit before she could reach it. ‘Sir, officiousness is not politeness,’\r\nshe said very slowly and forcibly.\r\n\r\n“To young ladies she frequently says, ‘My dear, _never_ marry for love:\r\nyou will repent it if you do; I _did_:’ and yet she was fond of her Lord\r\nWilliam.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Spencer Lyttelton rails at everything supernatural, so we spoke of\r\nthe story in his own family, and he told us the _facts_ of the Lyttelton\r\nghost, declaring that everything added to them about altering the clock,\r\n&c., was absolutely fictitious.\r\n\r\n“‘Thomas, Lord Lyttelton, my father’s first cousin, was at Peel House,\r\nnear Epsom, when a woman with whom he had lived seemed to appear to him.\r\nHe spoke of it to some friends--the Misses Amphlett--and said that the\r\nspirit had said he should die in three days, and that he believed that\r\nhe should certainly do so. Nevertheless, on the following day--he went\r\nup to London, and made one of his most brilliant speeches, for he was a\r\nreally great speaker--in the House of Lords. He was not well at the\r\ntime. On the third evening, his servant, after the custom of that time,\r\nwas in his room assisting him to undress. When the clock struck twelve,\r\nLord Lyttelton counted the strokes, and when it came to the last,\r\nexclaimed, “I have cheated the ghost,” and fell down dead: he must have\r\nhad something the matter with his heart.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Hinchinbroke, Dec. 26._--Lord Sandwich is a charmingly courteous host,\r\nand Lady Sandwich a warm, pleasant friend. The three sons, Hinchinbroke,\r\nVictor, and Oliver, are all cheery, kindly, and amusing. ‘You see what a\r\nset you’ve landed amongst,’ said Lord Sandwich; ‘it will take you some\r\ntime to know them.’ Agneta Montagu is here with her charming children;\r\nLady Honoria Cadogan; Miss Corry, a handsome, natural, lively\r\nlady-in-waiting to the Duchess of Edinburgh; and the kind old Duchess\r\nCaroline, with relays of walking-sticks, which she changes with her caps\r\nfor the different hours of the day.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday I went with Miss Corry and Hinchinbroke to Huntingdon, a\r\npicturesque old town on the sleepy Ouse. In the market-place, opposite\r\nthe principal church, is the old grammar-school where Oliver Cromwell\r\nwas educated. Mr. Dion Boucicault, of theatrical fame, is going to\r\nrestore it in memory of his son, killed hard by in the Abbots Repton\r\nrailway accident, and is going to destroy the one characteristic feature\r\nof the place--the high gable front of twisted and moulded brick, which\r\nrecalls Holland and records the Flemish settlers in the Fen country.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Christmas Day._--The damp, sleepy weather is far from an ideal\r\nChristmas, but I have liked being here in spite of a miserable cold, and\r\nbeing accepted as a sort of relation by this warm-hearted family.”[250]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Ascot Wood, Jan. 22, 1877._--I have been working quietly at home for\r\nnearly three weeks--a halt in life as far as the outer world is\r\nconcerned; and how good these silences are, when, from the turmoil of\r\nthe living present, one can retire into the companionship of a dead\r\npast--past associations, past interests, passed-away friends, who,\r\nthough dead, are living for ever in the innermost shrines of one’s\r\nheart, of which the general world knows nothing, at which very few care\r\nto knock; which, even to those who knock, are so seldom opened.\r\n\r\n“I have almost a pang when one of these breaks comes to an end, and the\r\noutside world rushes in. ‘On ne se détache jamais sans douleur.’[251]\r\nBut it was a great pleasure to come here again to the companionship of\r\nthis perfectly congenial cousinhood. Sir John Lefevre, as usual, is full\r\nof interesting conversation--not general, but with the one person next\r\nhim, and that one is generally myself! He described a visit in Sussex at\r\nSir Peckam Micklethwait’s (‘a man with other and more wonderful\r\nnames’).[252] When the Princess Victoria was at Hastings with the\r\nDuchess of Kent, their horses ran away. They were in the greatest peril,\r\nwhen Mr. Micklethwait, who was a huge and powerful man, stood in the\r\nway, and seized and grappled with the horses with his tremendous\r\nstrength, and they were saved. One of the first things the Queen did\r\nwhen she came to the throne was to make him a baronet.\r\n\r\n“Sir John said how few people there were now who remembered the origin\r\nof the word ‘fly’ as applied to a carriage. In the last century people\r\nalmost always went out to parties in sedan-chairs--a great fatigue and\r\ntrouble to their bearers. Gradually the sedans had wheels, and were\r\ndrawn. Then it began to dawn upon people to substitute a horse for a\r\nman. At that time the ‘Midsummer Night’s Dream’ was being acted and very\r\npopular, and, in allusion to a line in it, the new carriages were called\r\n‘Fly-by-Night.’ Then the sobriquet was abridged--‘by night’ was omitted,\r\nbut ‘fly’ remained. Sir John remembered, when flys were first invented,\r\nmeeting a man who said he had just ‘encountered’ a fly with a wasp\r\ninside and a bee (B) outside. It was Lord Brougham’s carriage.\r\n\r\n“We went this afternoon to Lady Julia Lockwood’s.[253] Her odd little\r\nhouse is quite full of relics of her sister, the Duchess of\r\nInverness--the Queen’s ‘Aunt Buggin,’ wife of the Duke of Sussex.\r\n\r\n“To-night, talking of my little diaries, Sir John said that he had a\r\nname for them--‘Seniority’--adapted from Nassau Senior’s journals. When\r\nSenior went about, however, people knew that what they said would be\r\ntaken down, so acted accordingly, and produced their sentiments and\r\nopinions as they wished them to be permanently represented. The Khedive\r\nwas told what Mr. Senior would do before he was admitted to his\r\ninterview. ‘Oh, yes, I quite understand,’ said the Khedive; ‘Mr. Senior\r\nis the trumpet, and I am to blow down it.’\r\n\r\n“Sir John described how in the Upper House of Convocation the members\r\namused their leisure moments by suiting each of the bishops with texts.\r\nThat for the Archbishop of York[254] was, ‘And _she_ was a Greek;’ for\r\nBishop Wilberforce, ‘She brought him _butter_ in a lordly dish.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 24._--When I arrived at the Ascot station, a little lady was\r\nthere, with glistening silver hair, waiting to go up to the house. It\r\nwas Mrs. William Grey. She was here two days and very pleasant--a\r\nbright, active, simple mind, which finds its vent in excitement for the\r\nsuperior education of women.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday we went to Windsor for the day. We went to the castle\r\nlibrary, where Natalli, the sub-librarian, showed us everything. It is\r\nvery interesting regarded merely as a building--not one room, but a\r\nsuccession of rooms, irregularly added as space allowed and comfort\r\ndictated, by a succession of sovereigns. Queen Elizabeth’s library (the\r\nonly part of the castle unaltered outside) has an old chimney-piece of\r\nher time, into which the Prince Consort cleverly inserted a bust from\r\nher figure by Cornelius Cure, and it once had a ceiling painted by\r\nVerrio, which was destroyed by William IV., who put up a stucco ceiling\r\ninstead. Of Anne there is the charming little boudoir, where she was\r\nsitting with the Duchess of Marlborough when a letter (a facsimile of\r\nwhich is preserved there) was brought in from the Duke telling of the\r\nvictory of Blenheim. The later rooms are of George III. and William IV.\r\nWe saw Miles Coverdale’s Bible, all the early editions of Shakspeare,\r\nCharles I.’s Prayer-book, Elizabeth’s Prayer-book, Sir Walter Scott’s\r\n‘Lay of the Last Minstrel’ with his corrections and alterations; but\r\nbetter far was the view from the end window, with the terrace and its\r\nfinal tower standing out in burly shadow against the misty and flooded\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Thorpe, Jan. 26._--We went to-day to St. Anne’s Hill. Lady Holland was\r\nsitting in the innermost of the richly furnished bright warm little\r\nrooms, but was bandaged up still from a frightful fall she had received\r\nby mistaking a staircase for a passage in the dark. One always feels\r\none’s own talk on waggon-wheels with a person who has the conversational\r\nreputation she has, and I was glad when Madame de Jarnac came in and\r\nundertook to show us the house. Lady Holland followed, and took us to\r\nher bedroom, which is charming, with a view towards Chobham. Then we\r\nwent to the gardens, with a temple to Friendship (_i.e._, to Lord\r\nHolland’s friendship), and the summer-house in which the preliminaries\r\nof the Peace of Amiens were signed. Other summer-houses are paved with\r\nencaustic tiles from Chertsey Abbey.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_69 Onslow Square, Jan. 27._--Mr. Byng preached a capital sermon to-day\r\nupon ‘religious hypochondriacs’--people who say, ‘You know I was always\r\nso spoilt when I was a child, you must make allowance for my being a\r\nlittle selfish now,’ &c.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_6 Bury Street, Feb. 13._--Last night I dined with the Haygarths, to\r\nmeet the Woods and Leslies. The Dowager Lady Spencer[255] was there, who\r\ngave an amusing account of her Irish experiences, when her stepson was\r\nLord Lieutenant. One day he was hunting, and had just leapt a hedge into\r\na lane, when he was aware that a funeral was coming up. He thought it\r\nmight hurt the feelings of the mourners if he passed them hunting, so he\r\nhid himself. But as the funeral came by the hounds appeared, and\r\ninstantly, setting the coffin down in the road, mourners, pall-bearers,\r\nand all started in hot pursuit, and Lord Spencer found himself left\r\nalone with the body.\r\n\r\n“Lady Spencer talked of one Irish gentleman, a Master of Hounds, who,\r\nbeing very much puzzled by the two Lady Spencers, and how to distinguish\r\nthem, settled the matter by calling them, like dogs, one ‘Countess,’ and\r\nthe other ‘Dowager.’ ‘The absurdity never struck me much,’ she said,\r\n‘till the last day of all, when Charlotte’s eyes were so red with\r\ncrying, and he, coming in, exclaimed, “Dowager, Dowager, what can we do\r\nto comfort Countess?”’\r\n\r\n“I have just been with Lady Halifax and the Corrys to see the Duke of\r\nSuffolk’s head at the church in the Minories--a most awful object.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bodley[256] told us last night that when he was staying at St.\r\nJohn’s College, Oxford, he saw a ghost. He could swear to it. He was in\r\na room which was in the broad moonlight of a summer’s night, for it had\r\nno shutters. Suddenly he heard a movement like that of a man under the\r\nbed, and then something thrown on the floor like a stick. He jumped up,\r\nbut there was nothing. He then went to bed again, when out of the floor\r\nin the moonlight rose the head and shoulders of a man. He saw it against\r\nthe chest of drawers. It hid two of the handles of the drawers, but not\r\nmore. Farther than that out of the ground it did not rise. He is quite\r\ncertain that he saw it, and quite certain that he was awake.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 14._--Luncheon at Miss Davenport Bromley’s to meet Mr. Portal.\r\nLord Houghton and his son and daughter were there. Mr. Portal has a\r\nscheme for educating the unfortunate Americans of gentle birth who have\r\nfallen from wealth to poverty owing to the changes on the cessation of\r\nthe slave trade in South Carolina, and he has been eminently successful.\r\nHe described the South Carolina reverses of fortune as most\r\nextraordinary. One of his friends died in his house who had once\r\npossessed an estate worth £300,000; yet, when his will was opened, it\r\nonly contained these words--‘I leave to the old and tried friend of my\r\nyouth, the Rev. ---- Portal, my only son!’ He had nothing else whatever\r\nto leave except £9 towards his funeral expenses. Mr. Portal described\r\nhow the ‘darkies’ had been ‘done’ since the change by those who had too\r\nmuch of the theory of religion to have any power left for the practice\r\nof it. Being at a place on the border, where some of the greatest\r\nbattles were, he asked some of the ‘darkies’ why, when they saw the\r\nNortherners gaining the upper hand, they did not join them. A ‘darkie’\r\nsaid, ‘Mossieu, did you ever see two dogs fighting for a bone?’--‘Yes,\r\nvery often.’--‘But, Mossieu, did you ever see the bone fight?’\r\n\r\n“The conversation fell on Philadelphia, ‘the most conservative place in\r\nAmerica, with its narrow streets and narrow notions.’ Lord Houghton said\r\nthat his son Robin had been shocked by the non-observance of Sunday in\r\nthe native city of Moody and Sankey. Mr. Portal said that Moody and\r\nSankey were utterly unknown, entirely without influence in their own\r\ncountry; that it could only be the most enormous amount of American\r\ncheek which had enabled them to come over to England, ‘exactly as if it\r\nwas a heathen country, to bring the light of the Gospel to the English;’\r\nthat America had heard with amazement and _shock_ how they were run\r\nafter; that they owed their success partly to their cheek, and partly to\r\ntheir music.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Portal described his feeling of desolation when he first arrived in\r\nEngland--‘not one soul he knew amongst all these millions;’ that the\r\nnext day a lady asked him to conduct her and her child to a pantomime.\r\nHe consented, without understanding that a pantomime meant Drury Lane\r\nTheatre, and his horror was intense when he ‘found himself, a clergyman\r\nof forty years’ standing,’ in such a place. This, however, was nothing\r\nto what he felt ‘when a troop of half-naked women rushed in and began to\r\nthrow up their legs into the air;’ he ‘could have sunk into the ground\r\nfor shame.’ ‘Was not the mother of our Lord a woman? was not my mother a\r\nwoman? is not my wife a woman? are not my daughters women? and what are\r\nthese?’\r\n\r\n“Mr. Knowles, the ex-editor of the _Contemporary Review_, who was at\r\nluncheon, said that he had taken Alfred Tennyson to see a ballet with\r\njust the same effect. When the ballet-girls trooped in wearing ‘une robe\r\nqui ne commence qu’à peine, et qui finit tout de suite,’ Tennyson had\r\nrushed at once out of the box, walked up and down in an agony over the\r\ndegradation of the nineteenth century, and nothing would induce him to\r\ngo in again. Mr. Knowles said, however, that a general improvement in\r\nthe stage had dated from a climax of impropriety in ‘Bedel and Bijou:’\r\nit had since been much leavened by Irving. Lord Houghton described how\r\nmuch of Irving’s success had been due to the entirely original view he\r\nhad taken of his characters; that in Hamlet he had taken ‘the domestic\r\nview, not declaiming, but pondering, saying things meditatively with his\r\nlegs over a chair-back.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 24._--I have been seeing a great deal of Willie Milligan lately,\r\nand cannot help thinking of the characteristics so distinctive of him\r\nwhom for twenty-six years I have never ceased to feel _honoured_ in\r\nbeing allowed to call my intimate friend.\r\n\r\n“He is a thorough-bred gentleman in all the highest senses of the term.\r\nAlways without riches, he has never complained of having less than was\r\nsufficient for his wants, which are most modest. Without being\r\ncultivated, he is very clever. He never talks religion, but his life is\r\nthoroughly christian. He is the soul of honour, pure, truthful,\r\nblameless, and without reproach; yet in conversation no one is more\r\nwitty, original, and amusing. He is celebrated as a peace-maker, and\r\nnever fails to show that chivalry is the truest wisdom. He has never\r\ndone a selfish act, and never omitted to do a kind one.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 25._--A visit to Mrs. Lowe. She talked of the contemptible state\r\nof politics now; that it was all only playing at the old game of brag;\r\nthat the object with every one seems to be who can tell most lies, and\r\nwho can get any one to believe his lies most easily. If she ‘was\r\nminister it would be different; she would nail men down to a point--what\r\nwill you do and what will you not do? and have a direct answer; _then_\r\none would know how to act.’\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lowe described his life in Australia. Money then scarcely existed\r\nthere: payments were made either in kind or in bills of exchange. He\r\nsaid, ‘When we played whist, we played sheep, with bullocks on the\r\nrubber; and when a man won much, he had to hire a field next morning to\r\nput his winnings in.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 28._--A charming visit to old Lord John Thynne, who told me many\r\nof his delightful reminiscences of Sydney Smith, Milman, and others.\r\n\r\n“Then to Mrs. Duncan Stewart, who was sitting almost on the ground,\r\ncovered with an eider-down. She talked of our ‘Memorials’ and of Mrs.\r\nGrote, who said, when she read of the dear mother’s marvellous trances,\r\n‘My dear, she was thinking more than was good for her; so God in His\r\ngreat mercy gave her chloroform.’ She spoke of the difficulties of a\r\nlike faith, of the effort of keeping it up when prayer was _not_\r\nanswered, believing in the power of prayer just the same. She told how,\r\nwhen her child was dying--she knew it must die--the clergyman came (it\r\nwas at Wimbledon) and used to kneel by the table and pray that\r\nresignation might be given to the mother to bear the parting, and\r\nresignation to the child to die; and how she listened and prayed too;\r\nand yet, at the end, she could not feel it. She did not, and--though she\r\nknew it was impossible--she could not but break in with, ‘Yet, O Lord,\r\nyet _restore_ her.’\r\n\r\n“‘Do you know,’ said Mrs. Stewart, ‘that till I was thirty, I had never\r\nseen death--never seen it even in a poor person; then I saw it in my own\r\nchild, and I may truly say that then Death entered into the world for me\r\nas truly as it did for Eve, and it never left me afterwards--_never_. If\r\none of my children had an ache afterwards, I thought it was going to\r\ndie; if I awoke in the night and looked at my husband in his sleep, I\r\nthought--“He will look like that when he is dead.”\r\n\r\n“‘Do not think I murmur, but life _is_ very trying when one knows so\r\nlittle of the beyond. The clergyman’s wife has just been, and she said,\r\n“But you must believe; you must believe Scripture literally; you must\r\nbelieve all it says to the letter.” But I cannot believe literally: one\r\ncan only use the faith one has, I have not the faith which moves\r\nmountains. I have prayed that the mountains might move, with all the\r\nfaith that was in me--_all_; but the mountains did not move. No, I\r\ncannot pray with the faith which is not granted me.\r\n\r\n“‘I think that I believe all the promises of Scripture; yet when I think\r\nof Death, I hesitate to wish to leave the certainty here for what\r\nis--yes, must be--the uncertainty beyond. Yet lately, when I was so ill,\r\nwhen I continued to go down and down into the very depths, I felt I had\r\ngot so far--so very far, it would be difficult to travel all that way\r\nagain--“Oh, let me go through the gates now.” And then the comforting\r\nthought came that perhaps after all it might _not_ be the will of God\r\nthat I should travel the _same_ way again, and that when He leads me up\r\nto the gates for the last time, it might be His will to lead me by some\r\nother, by some quite different way.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 4._--Breakfast with Lord Houghton--a pleasant male party--Dr.\r\nRalston, Henry James the American novelist, Sir Samuel Baker, and three\r\nothers. Harriet Martineau’s Memoirs had just arrived, and were a great\r\ntopic. Lord Houghton, who had known her well, said how often he had been\r\nsent for to take leave of Miss Martineau when she had been supposed to\r\nbe dying, and had gone at great personal inconvenience; but she had\r\nlived for thirty years after the first time. Her fatal illness (dropsy)\r\nhad set in before she went to America. Her friends tried strongly to\r\ndissuade her from going, suggesting that she would be very ill received\r\nin consequence of her opinions. ‘Why, Harriet,’ said Sydney Smith, ‘you\r\nknow, if you go, they will tar and feather you, and then they will turn\r\nyou loose in the woods, and the wild turkeys will come and say, “Why,\r\nwhat strange bird are you?”’\r\n\r\n“Of course, much of politics was talked, especially about the Turkish\r\natrocities. Sir S. Baker said that at the old Duchess of Cleveland’s he\r\nhad met Lord Winchester, now quite an old man. He said that he had\r\nridden from Constantinople to the Danube in 1832, and had passed thirty\r\nimpaled persons on the way. He himself (Sir Samuel) had seen the\r\nimpaling machine on the Nile--a stake tapered like a pencil, over which\r\na wheel was let down to a certain height, and when the man was impaled,\r\nhe was let down on the wheel and rested there; he often lived for three\r\nor four days; if the machine was in the market-places of the country\r\ntowns, the relations of the victims gave them coffee. ‘It is not worse,’\r\nsaid Lord Houghton, ‘than the stories we are told every Sunday: “he\r\ndestroyed them all, he left not one of them alive;” especially of the\r\ncruelties of David, who made his enemies pass under the harrow, a\r\npunishment much worse than impalement. How grateful David would have\r\nbeen for a steam-roller! what a number of people he would have been able\r\nto despatch at once!’\r\n\r\n“At Mrs. Tennant’s I saw the three girls who have been so much admired,\r\nand painted by Millais and so many others; their chief beauty consisting\r\nin their picturesqueness as a group.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 5._--To Mr. Brandram’s recitation of the ‘Merchant of Venice’ at\r\nLord Overstone’s. He said the whole play by heart, giving different\r\ncharacter and expression to each person--an astonishing effort of\r\nmemory. Hearing a play in this way certainly fixes it in the mind much\r\nmore than reading it, though not so much as seeing it.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 8._--Luncheon at charming old Mrs. Thellusson’s, where I met\r\nMadame Taglioni, the famous _danseuse_. She is now an old lady, with\r\npretty refined features, perfect grace of movement, and a most\r\nattractive manner. She has begun in her old age to give lessons again\r\nfor the benefit of her family, though she is, at the same time,\r\npresenting her princess grand-daughter--the Princess Marguerite\r\nTrubetskoi, a simple natural girl. Madame Taglioni spoke of her dancing\r\nas ‘un don de Dieu,’ just as she would of music or any other art. We\r\nasked her if she would like to be young again. ‘Oh, yes, indeed,’ she\r\nsaid; ‘how I _should_ dance!’ She said her father, a ballet-master, made\r\nher practise nine hours a day; ‘however great a talent you may have, you\r\nnever can bring it to perfection without that amount of practice.’\r\n\r\n“Lady Charlemont was there, and after luncheon we asked her to recite.\r\nShe made no difficulties, but said nothing; only, while we had almost\r\nforgotten her, she had glided round the room to where there was a red\r\ncurtain for a background, and suddenly, but slowly, she began. It was\r\nonly a simple ballad of Tennyson--‘Oh, the Earl was fair to see’--but\r\nshe threw a power into it which was almost agony, and the pauses were\r\nabsolute depths of pathos. You felt the power of her unfaltering\r\nvengeance, you _heard_ the raging of the storm ‘in turret and tree;’\r\nand, when the moment of the murder came, you quivered in every nerve as\r\nshe stabbed the Earl ‘through and through.’ It was absolutely awful.\r\n\r\n“Afterwards Mrs. Greville recited ‘Jeanne d’Arc.’ It is her best part.\r\nShe cannot look refined, but an inspired French paysanne she can look\r\nand be thoroughly.\r\n\r\n“Sir Baldwin Leighton made himself so pleasant, that when he asked me to\r\ngo to their box at the Lyceum in the evening, I promised to go, though I\r\nnever like seeing any, even the very best plays, twice. However, the\r\nnearness of the box to the stage enabled me to see many details\r\nunobserved before. Richard III. will always, I should think, be Irving’s\r\nbest part, for he looks the incarnation of the person. In Shakspeare,\r\nRichard III. is most anxious to become king, and perfectly determined to\r\nremain king when he has become so; but Irving carries out far more than\r\nthis. Irving’s Richard is perfectly determined that vice shall triumph\r\nover virtue, and utterly enraptured when it does triumph, in a way which\r\nis quite diabolical. The night before Bosworth Field is most striking\r\nand beautiful. You are with the king in his tent. He draws the curtain\r\nand looks out. On the distant wind-stricken heath the camp-fires are\r\nalight, and the lights in the tents blaze out one by one, eclipsing the\r\nstars overhead. Richard says little for a time; your whole mind is\r\nallowed the repose of the beauty. The king, who has been through the\r\nlast acts trying (you feel him striving against his personal\r\ndisadvantages) to be kingly, is all-kingly on that night, in the\r\nimmediate face of the great future on which everything hangs. He gives\r\nhis orders--simply, briefly, royally. He lies down on the couch, folding\r\nhimself in the royal velvet robe, which, like Creusa’s cloak, is\r\nassociated with all his crimes. He falls asleep. Then, out of the almost\r\ndarkness, just visible as outlines but no more, rise the phantoms; and,\r\nlike a whiffling wind, the voice of Clarence floats across the stage. As\r\neach spirit delivers its message in the same faint spiritual harmonious\r\nmonotone, the sleeping figure shudders and groans, moans more sadly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONDON BRIDGE FROM BILLINGSGATE.][257]\r\n\r\n“Then there is a powerfully human touch in the way in which he, so\r\ncoldly royal as he lay down, turns human-like for sympathy in his great\r\nhorror and anguish to the first person he sees, the soldier who wakens\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 10._--Went with Victor Parnell down the river in search of the\r\nold houses at Limehouse and Stepney. We found them, but the accounts in\r\nthe _Daily News_, which had led us to the excursion, were so exaggerated\r\nthat the houses were scarcely to be recognised. We came back by\r\nRatcliffe Highway. It all looked very clean, and thriving, and decent,\r\nvery different indeed from the descriptions in religious magazines.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 11._--Luncheon with Sir Robert and Lady Cunliffe, who showed me\r\na volume of portrait sketches by Downman, a little-known master of\r\nGeorge III.’s time, but a wonderfully charming artist.”\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.

I promised\r\nall the help I could give, but did not understand, till several months\r\nlater, that they wished me to undertake the whole biography myself.\r\nThis, however, I rejoiced to do, being assured that beyond her own\r\nchildren, no one had a warmer love and appreciation for the friend of my\r\nwhole life, and delighting to be raised, whilst dwelling amongst her\r\nwritten words and thoughts, into the serene and lofty atmosphere of her\r\ninner life.\r\n\r\nThe work which I had undertaken began at this time to bring me into\r\nconstant and intimate connection with all the branches of the Bunsen\r\nfamily, especially with Lady Llanover, the sister of my dear old friend.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Llanover, March 18, 1877._--I left London on my birthday and went to\r\nthe Harfords at Blaise Castle. It was bright but bitter March weather,\r\nand though the woods were full of flowers, there was no enjoyment of\r\nthem. I had much talk with sweet Mrs. Harford about old days and the\r\nmany passed-away things and people dear to us both. Sir George and Lady\r\nGrey were staying at Blaise, to my great pleasure.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday I came here by the ferry over the Severn. Lady Llanover’s old\r\nramshackle carriage met me at the Nantyderry Station, and brought me to\r\nLlanover. I had received endless solemn warnings about what I was to say\r\nand not to say here, what to do and not to do; but with a person of whom\r\none is not likely to see much in after life, one never feels any alarm.\r\nLady Llanover is very small and has been very pretty. We have a mutual\r\nbond in our love for her sister, whose memory is enshrined in her inmost\r\nheart with that of her mother, Mrs. Waddington, to whom she was quite\r\npassionately devoted. Of the Bunsen family she talked from 4 till 10.30\r\nP.M. ‘You see I have still the full use of my lungs,’ she said.\r\n\r\n“At eight we had tea. There is no dinner, which I like, but every one\r\nwould not. After tea she gathered up all the lumps of sugar which\r\nremained and emptied them with a great clatter into a box, which she\r\nlocked up. With £20,000 a year, the same economy pervades everything.\r\nHer great idea is Wales--that she lives in Wales (which many doubt), and\r\nthat the people must be kept Welsh, and she has Welsh schools, Welsh\r\nservices, a Welsh harper, always talks Welsh to her servants, and wears\r\na Welsh costume at church.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n“_March 24, 1877._--I may tell you now, as it is no longer a secret,\r\nthat I have acceded to the wish of all her family in undertaking to\r\nwrite the Life and edit the beautiful letters of my dear old friend the\r\nBaroness de Bunsen. How perfectly great and noble her character was, and\r\nthe intense interest of all she wrote, few know better than myself, and,\r\nbeyond her own family, no one loved her more; so, when my ‘London’ is\r\ndone, I shall give myself gladly to this sacred task, and trust that it\r\nmay be, as _her_ writings cannot fail to be, a blessing to many.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, April 6, 1877._--I look back on my visit to Llanover as\r\nquite a bit apart in my life. It was important that I should please, as\r\nmuch of the success of the memorials of her sister, which I have\r\nundertaken to edit, must depend upon Lady Llanover’s favourable\r\nco-operation. It was equally important that I should assert my own\r\nabsolute independence of will and action, and knock under in nothing. So\r\nit was a difficult course to steer. The very warnings I had received\r\nwere enough to annihilate self-confidence. I was not to believe anything\r\nLady Llanover said about different members of her family, for she was\r\nalways guided by her own prejudices and sympathies. I was not to be\r\nguided by her opinion on any subject, yet was never to contradict her. I\r\nwas not to make to her any one of the promises she was sure to attempt\r\nto exact from me: above all, I was never to leave any letter or paper\r\nabout in my room, as there were always ‘tame panthers stealing about the\r\nhouse,’ who would master the contents and make it known to their\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\n“I began by disregarding _all_ this advice, and taking Lady Llanover as\r\nif I had never heard a word about her, and I am sure that it was the\r\nbest way. I listened to all she had to say, and received part of it to\r\nprofit by. I left all my papers about, and if the mistress of the house\r\nlearnt what was in them, I hope it was beneficial to her. I found her\r\ndifficult to deal with certainly, but chiefly because, with endless\r\npower of talking and a vocabulary absolutely inexhaustible, it is next\r\nto impossible to keep her in the straight conversational path along\r\nwhich she ought to be travelling: she will linger to pick all the\r\nflowers that grow in the lanes diverging along the wayside. Thus, though\r\non an average we talked for six hours a day, not more than one of those\r\nhours could be utilised.\r\n\r\n“There is a great deal to admire in Lady Llanover: her pertinacity in\r\nwhat she _thinks_ right, whether she _is_ right or not: her insistence\r\non carrying out her sovereign will in all things; but chiefly her\r\ntouching devotion to the memory of the mother from whom she, the\r\nyoungest and favourite daughter, was scarcely ever separated. The\r\nwhitewashed ‘Upper House’ in the park is kept fresh and bright and\r\naired, as if the long-lost mother were constantly expected. In her\r\nsitting-room a bright fire burns in winter, and fresh flowers are daily\r\nplaced on the little table by her old-fashioned sofa. The plants she\r\nloved are tended and blooming in the little garden; the pictures and\r\nbooks are unremoved from the walls; the peacocks she used to feed, or\r\ntheir descendants, still spread their bright tails in the sun under her\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\n“It is in the kitchen of the ‘Upper House’ that Lady Llanover’s Welsh\r\nchaplain performs service on Sundays, for to the church she and her\r\npeople will not go, as the clergyman is--undesirable. Lady Llanover on\r\nSundays is even more Welsh than on week-days. She wears a regular man’s\r\ntall hat and short petticoats like her people, and very becoming the\r\ndress is to her, and very touching the earnestness of the whole\r\ncongregation in their national costume, joining so fervently--like one\r\nperson--in the services, especially in the singing, which is exquisitely\r\nbeautiful. I suppose it may be only from the novelty, but this earnest\r\nservice, these humble prayers on the worn benches in the brick-floored\r\nkitchen, with the incidents of manual labour in the background, and\r\nfarmhouse scenes outside the windows, seemed more of a direct appeal to\r\nGod than any formal prayers I ever heard in a church--the building\r\ncalled a church. I feel more and more that I shall probably end my\r\ndays--a Dissenter!\r\n\r\n“We had more of the Welsh music in the evening. We went and sat in the\r\narmchairs in the hall, and the household filed in above, and filled the\r\nmusic-gallery, and sang most gloriously, especially the burial-hymn ‘It\r\nis finished,’ which was sung in parts all the way from the house to the\r\nchurchyard at the funerals of Mrs. Waddington and Lord Llanover and his\r\nson. At other times, the blind harper attached to the house came in and\r\nharped to us, and four little boys sat in a circle on the floor and\r\nsang.\r\n\r\n“One afternoon we went to the churchyard overlooking the Usk. A great\r\npine-tree, the seed of which was brought from Rome by Mrs. Waddington,\r\novershadows the burial-place of the family, and, in accordance with a\r\nline in some poet she liked, her grave is covered with the simple\r\ncamomile. By its side is the colossal altar-tomb of Lord Llanover. It is\r\ngenerally supposed to be merely commemorative, but Lady Llanover herself\r\nunlocked a door concealed beneath the carving, and we went in. There are\r\nthree coffins--of Lord Llanover, his eldest son, and his grandson\r\nStephàn, son of Mrs. Herbert of Llanarth, whom she, the Roman Catholic\r\nmother, insisted should be brought here, the priests accompanying the\r\ncorpse to the churchyard gate, and there delivering it to the Welsh\r\npeople, who sang their beautiful hymns over it. There was a fourth place\r\nin the tomb, which Lady Llanover, tearless in her desolation, showed me\r\nas hers, which she must soon occupy. The poor Welsh women were busy\r\n‘dressing the graves’ in the churchyard--the graves are always dressed\r\nfor Palm Sunday.\r\n\r\n“At Llanover, in the weird house of dead associations, it was a relief\r\nwhen pleasant, handsome young Arthur Herbert came the last day. Almost\r\nthe only other guest was Miss Geraldine Jewsbury, the intimate and\r\nfaithful friend of Mrs. Carlyle. I found it difficult to trace in the\r\nancient spinster the gifted brilliancy I had heard described, though of\r\nher strong will there was abundant evidence.[258] During an illness of\r\nMrs. Carlyle there was a comic instance of this. Miss Jewsbury had\r\nunlimited faith in black currant jelly for a cold. Now Mrs. Carlyle’s\r\nthroat was very bad, and Miss Jewsbury took some of her jelly to her.\r\n‘But I will not take it; I will not take it, Geraldine,’ said Mrs.\r\nCarlyle, with her strong inflexion on the ‘ine.’ So Miss Jewsbury sat by\r\nthe head of the bed and kept her black currant jelly well out of sight.\r\nBut a moment came when Mrs. Carlyle fell fast asleep, and--if the truth\r\nmust be told--opened her mouth very wide. It was Miss Jewsbury’s\r\nopportunity, and she filled a spoon full of jelly, and popped it into\r\nthe open mouth. ‘Good God! Geraldine, what was that?’ exclaimed Mrs.\r\nCarlyle, waking up. ‘_That_ was the black currant jelly.’--‘Good God,\r\nGeraldine! I thought it was a leech gone the wrong way.’\r\n\r\n“Since I returned, I have greatly enjoyed a fortnight’s halt in life at\r\nhome. When here, with charming rooms full of books and pictures,\r\ninexhaustible employment within and without, and the dear Lea, the one\r\nliving relic of _our_ past, I wonder how I can ever go away.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_April 14._--The other day I dined at Lord Charlemont’s. Lady\r\nCharlemont[259] is astonishing. I sat near her at dinner. First she\r\nstartled me by saying what a bore her neighbour on the other side was:\r\nit was Lord Campbell. Then she said, ‘I am so happy. I have found some\r\none who breaks the first commandment.’--‘What! “Thou shalt have none\r\nother gods but me?”’--‘Yes, and the man who breaks it is Dr. Schliemann;\r\nhe adds Jupiter and Venus and a lot of others, all on the same level.’\r\n\r\n“Sir Julius Benedict was at dinner, a most amusing person. He described\r\nhow he was at Mentmore, and sat up very late in the hall reading, the\r\nrest of the gentlemen having gone to the smoking-room, and Baron\r\nRothschild having gone to bed. He was surprised after some time to see\r\nBaron Rothschild come down again and cross the entrance hall in\r\nconversation with a strange gentleman. Soon after, when Sir Julius had\r\ngone to his own room, a guest in the house knocked at the door and\r\napologised for disturbing him, but begged to know if he knew Sir James\r\nFergusson by sight. He said, ‘Yes, perfectly,’ and then he remembered\r\nwho the stranger was whom he had seen crossing the hall with the Baron:\r\nit was Sir James Fergusson; he had not recognised him at the moment.\r\n\r\n“The guest said, ‘You do not know what an awkward difficulty you have\r\nrelieved us from; a gentleman has arrived who seems to think he is\r\nexpected, and whom nobody knows, and he says he is Sir James Fergusson.’\r\nAnd it was.\r\n\r\n“Sir James had been called out from dinner by a servant from Mentmore,\r\nwho said that there had been no time to write, but that he had been\r\nsent off to fetch him, for the Baroness was so alarmingly ill that there\r\nwas not a moment to be lost. Sir James rushed off in a cab to Euston\r\nSquare, and asked for a special train. It was Sunday, and there was none\r\nto be had without great delay; but the station-master, hearing the\r\nurgency of the case, and whom it was for, said that the express, just\r\nstarting, should be allowed to stop at the station for Mentmore. On\r\narriving there, Sir James was surprised to find no carriage, but\r\nprocured a trap from the inn, and drove as hard as he could. As they\r\nreached the house, the servant got down and went round it, saying he was\r\ngoing in the other way.\r\n\r\n“The servant was quite mad, and the insanity first showed itself in this\r\nodd form.\r\n\r\n“Sir Julius also told us that--\r\n\r\n“‘One day an American bishop called in his carriage at Hunt & Roskell’s.\r\nHe asked to see some bracelets, mentioning that he was returning to\r\nAmerica and wished to take a present to his wife. ‘Nothing very\r\nexpensive,’ he said; ‘he could not afford that, but something about £70\r\nor £80.’ Eventually he agreed to take a bracelet that cost £100. He said\r\nthat he would pay for it with a £100 note which he had with him: it\r\nhappened to be the only money he had at the moment, but he would wait\r\nwhile they sent it to the bank to ascertain that it was all right; he\r\nshould really prefer doing this. They sent it to the bank and received\r\nanswer that it was perfectly correct.\r\n\r\n“‘Having paid for his bracelet, the bishop took it, and was just about\r\nto step into his carriage, when a policeman tapped him on the shoulder\r\nand said, ‘Hallo, Jim! you’re up to your old tricks again, are you?\r\nYou’ll just come along with me,’ and he brought him back into the shop.\r\nHunt & Roskell said there was some mistake, that the gentleman was an\r\nAmerican bishop, that he had just bought a £100 bracelet and paid for it\r\nwith an excellent £100 note. ‘Just let me look at the note, will you?’\r\nsaid the policeman. He looked at it and said, ‘Yes, it’s just as I\r\nthought; this note is one of a particularly clever batch of forgeries,\r\nwhich are very difficult to detect, and the man is no more a bishop than\r\nyou are. We will go off to the police-station at once. I will take the\r\nnote and go on with the prisoner in the carriage, and you must send your\r\nmen in a cab to meet us and bear witness.’ So the policeman took the\r\nbishop and the bracelet and the note, but when Hunt & Roskell’s men\r\nreached the police-station, they had not yet arrived; and they have\r\nnever been heard of since!’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_April 15._--Dined with Mrs. Rogerson, daughter of my dear Mrs. Duncan\r\nStewart. Irving was there. I ventured to tell him how I thought his play\r\nwas spoilt by the changes he had recently made, and _why_, and he was\r\nquite simple, as he always is, not the least offended, and in the end\r\nagreed with me, and said he should alter the changes as I suggested, and\r\nsend me a box that I might come and see the improvement. He said how,\r\never since he heard me tell a story at Lord Ducie’s, he had wished I\r\nshould do something in public. He ‘did not know if I wanted money, but\r\nthought I could make any sum I liked.’ He ‘believed he could guarantee’\r\nmy making £8000 a year! He advised my doing what he had intended doing\r\nhimself when he had been ‘making a mere nothing of ten guineas a week,\r\nand felt _that_ could not go on.’ He intended to have got Wilkie Collins\r\nto write him a story, and to take a room at the Egyptian Hall, fit it up\r\nin an old-fashioned way, sit down by the fire, and then take the\r\naudience, as it were, at once into his room and confidence. ‘But in your\r\ncase,’ he said, ‘you need not apply to Wilkie Collins.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_April 16._--Miss Northcote’s wedding in Westminster Abbey. I had a\r\ncapital place in a stall just behind Princess Louise and Princess Mary\r\nof Teck. The church was crowded, and though it was a bitter wind\r\noutside, it was quite glorious within, all the forest of arches tinted\r\nwith golden sunlight. Arthur gave the blessing _magnificently_, as he\r\nalways does. There were 350 people at the breakfast afterwards, which\r\nwas at Lord Beaconsfield’s house in Downing Street. There were endless\r\nlittle tables. I sat at one with Lady Aberdare, Lady Middleton, and\r\nyoung Lord Colchester. I was glad to see the dear little Lady Winifred\r\nHerbert again, growing up fast, but with the same sweet innocent\r\nexpression, walking about with Jim Cranbourne, who is a charming boy.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_April 23._--Dined with Lady Charlemont. Old Mr. Planché was there, and\r\ntalked much about the favourable characteristics of the present Duke of\r\nWellington; how before his father died he said how grief for his death\r\nwould be aggravated by perpetual consciousness of his own name and\r\nposition. ‘Think what it will be when the Duke of Wellington is\r\nannounced and only _I_ come in!’ Poor Mr. Planché, celebrated as a wit\r\nand story-teller in former times, is becoming painfully aware of having\r\noutlived the patience of his auditors!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHANTRY OF HENRY V.][260]\r\n\r\n“Lady Charlemont said, ‘Whenever I make a _very_ naughty quotation from\r\n‘Don Juan,’ I always preface it by saying, ‘As Dr. Watts touchingly\r\nobserves.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_April 26._--Dined at Mrs. Stratford Dugdale’s. Lord Crewe was there,\r\nwith the most extraordinary and diabolic-looking red flower in his\r\nbutton-hole. He always has one of these weird orchids, and delights to\r\nsurprise people with them.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_April 28._--A pleasant morning with Mrs. Hollond, Sir Hampton\r\nLorraine, and others at Grosvenor House. The rooms were quite lovely,\r\nand the flowers more so--great blue-green bowls filled with cowslips;\r\ngreat glasses of blue bells, with a few yellow jonquils intermixed.\r\n\r\n“Luncheon afterwards at Mrs. Duncan Stewart’s. Mrs. Rogerson told the\r\nstory of a cat she had known who would lie on the rug with its head on\r\nthe side of a little dog called Flossy. People said, ‘How selfish the\r\ncat is; she only lies there because it is warm.’ But Flossy died and the\r\ncat was missing. It was found on Flossy’s grave, and lay there all\r\nnight. It was brought in and milk was given to it, but it refused to\r\neat, and as soon as it was left alone in the room where it was shut up,\r\nit dashed straight through the window and went back to the grave again.\r\nIf they took hot milk out to it at the grave, it ate it, but away from\r\nthe grave it would eat nothing. It lay there day and night. At last they\r\nbuilt it a little pent-house over the grave, and it lay there, partially\r\nsheltered, till, six weeks afterwards, it died.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Rogerson knew another story of a terrier and a cat, who were\r\ndeadly foes and always quarrelling. The cat had kittens, and the kittens\r\nwere all put out of the way and were buried. The cat was inconsolable\r\nand went mewing about the house. The terrier could not make it out, and\r\nfollowed her everywhere; he did not snap at her any more; on the\r\ncontrary, he seemed to do all he could to console her. At last he had an\r\ninspiration. He found out where the kittens were buried, and scratched\r\nand scratched till he got them up, and one by one he brought the dead\r\nkittens and laid them down before the cat. It was a very small\r\nconsolation to poor pussy, but she and the terrier never quarrelled\r\nagain, and were the greatest friends as long as they lived.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 2._--A pleasant party at Lady Leslie’s beautiful house to meet the\r\nTecks. She looked more amenable than ever, yet the Princess all over.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 4._--Dined with Sir Dighton and Lady Probyn in the strange houses\r\nbuilt like the Tower of Babel by Mr. Hankey. Went to a quaint collection\r\nof anybodies and nobodies at Lord Houghton’s afterwards. He spoke of the\r\n‘unexpected places in which gold is found’ in literature.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 6._--To Lady Salisbury, whom I found in her bright sunny boudoir\r\nlooking on the Park. Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice and Mr. Ralli came in and\r\ntalked politics furiously. Lady Maude told me of Lord Sligo’s visit to\r\nParis immediately after the siege, and how he had driven about in the\r\nsame cab for some days, and then found he had been sitting all the time\r\non an explosive bomb which was under the seat. The cabman, when\r\nremonstrated with, as the slightest jolt might have made it explode,\r\nsaid he ‘had not left it at home, because he thought the children might\r\nget playing with it.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 11._--At dinner at Lady Jane Ellice’s I met Lady Waterford and\r\nLady Folkestone.[261] The latter sang most beautifully and pathetically.\r\nShe _felt_. ‘One cannot feel always,’ she said; ‘one cannot feel with an\r\naudience who say, “How sweet.” Lady Waterford told of Sir Philip and\r\nLady Durham. Lady Durham died quite suddenly. She had been out in the\r\ngarden the day before, seeing the gardener and ordering some bouquets\r\nshe wanted. After her sudden death, Sir Philip found a paper in her\r\ndressing-box. It said--‘Something so very odd has happened to me, that I\r\nthink I had better write it down. In the garden I saw a figure which\r\nbeckoned to me and beckoned to me, and I followed it. I followed it a\r\nlong way, and at last it reached the churchyard, and then it\r\ndisappeared.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 12._--Dined at Mrs. Rogerson’s, where I took down the Countess\r\nBremer, who has always lived at the Hanoverian Court. She is that\r\n‘Margaret Bremer’ who is celebrated for her answer to the blind King,\r\nwho loved to shock her by his improper stories. ‘What do you think of\r\nthat, Margaret?’ he asked, after telling her one of his worst. ‘I think\r\nthat your Majesty has a very clean way of telling a very dirty story,’\r\nshe replied.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 15._--Dined at Sir John Shaw-Lefevre’s. Having two round tables\r\nmade the party most pleasant. It included the beautiful and charming\r\nLady Granville, Lady Russell, Lady Aberdeen, and Wallace of the Russian\r\nbook.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 17._--A party at Lord Houghton’s; every one there, from Princess\r\nLouise to Mrs. Anthony Trollope, a beautiful old lady with snow-white\r\nhair turned back. These crowded parties remind me of Madame de Staëls\r\ndescription--‘Une société aux coups de poing.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 26._--I have been for three days at Cobham, where the woods\r\ncovered with bluebells were like expanses of Italian sky brought down\r\nand laid on the earth. There was a large party in the house--Lady\r\nHaddington and her bright Lady Ruth; Murray Finch Hatton and his wife,\r\nas delicate as a drooping lily; Meysey Clive, a charming natural fellow,\r\nand his Lady Catherine; Lord and Lady Pelham, &c. The life was most\r\neasy; we drew, read, talked, and showed the house to Lord and Lady\r\nOnslow, who arrived while touring in a four-in-hand.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 30._--On Saturday I was at a pleasant party at Lord Houghton’s,\r\nmeeting scarcely any one but authors, and a very odd collection--Black,\r\nYates, and James the novelists; Sir Francis Doyle and Swinburne the\r\npoets; Mrs. Singleton the erotic poetess (Violet Fane), brilliant with\r\ndiamonds; Mallock, who has suddenly become a lion from having written a\r\nclever squib called ‘The New Republic,’ and Mrs. Julia Ward Howe with\r\nher daughter. I was introduced to Mrs. Howe, having asked Lord Houghton\r\nwho was the charming, simply-dressed woman with the sensible face, and\r\nthen found she was sister of my Roman friend Mrs. Terry. She wrote the\r\nhymn, singing which the troops took Pittsburg. We asked her about it.\r\nShe said she could not help feeling the little annoyance so many felt on\r\nsimilar occasions--that she should be only known as the authoress of one\r\nthing, one little waif out of all her work, and that people should treat\r\nher as if she had _only_ written that.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 3._--I have dined several times with Miss Wright to meet the\r\nCharles Wilbrahams. She sings beautifully. He had much that was curious\r\nto tell about the project of a French engineer for deepening the course\r\nof the brook Kishon, so as to let in the Mediterranean. Kishon rises\r\nnear Tabor, and if the Mediterranean could once pass the watershed, it\r\nwould run down on the other side into the great hollow of the Dead Sea,\r\nwhich is now so far below its own level. The engineer, of course, had\r\nnever thought of Ezekiel xlvii., in which the fishermen of Engedi, now\r\nsome 3000 feet above the level of the sea, are described as casting in\r\ntheir nets.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Wilbraham was amusing with some of his American experiences. He\r\ntold of two young girls who were stopped going through a turnpike gate.\r\n‘What are your charges?’--‘Half a dollar for man and horse.’--‘Well,\r\nthen, just stand on one side, will you, for we are two girls and a\r\nmare, so we’ve nothing to pay.’ He said he had asked an American at\r\nFlorence what he thought of the Venus de Medicis. ‘Wal, I guess I’m not\r\nso partiklar overpowered by stone gals,’ was the reply.\r\n\r\n“I constantly meet Froude the historian at Miss Wright’s, a somewhat\r\nshy, sardonic, and silent man. His sphinx-like character, the very doubt\r\nabout him, makes him interesting: one never really knows what he would\r\nbe at.”[262]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 4._--Dined at Lord Egerton of Tatton’s. Old Mrs. Mildmay told a\r\nrather improper story there, which was received with shouts of\r\nmerriment. She was at a country-house where there was a very pleasant\r\nman named Jones, and there was also a lady who had a maid called Jones:\r\nthe people in the house knew this, because there was a confusion about\r\nletters. The lady’s husband went away for the day, and, as she was going\r\nto walk to the station in the evening to meet him, the mistress of the\r\nhouse asked Mr. Jones to walk with her. When the train came in, the\r\nhusband was not there, but just then a telegram was brought in. ‘Oh,’\r\nsaid the lady, ‘Oh-o-o, I’m sure my husband is dead: I can’t open\r\nit.’--‘Nonsense!’ said Mr. Jones; ‘if he is dead, he cannot have sent\r\nyou a telegram.’--‘Well, I can’t open it; I know it’s something\r\ndreadful--I can’t, I can’t, I can’t.’ So at last, Mr. Jones opened it\r\nfor her and read it aloud, not seeing at once what it contained. It\r\nwas--‘I am all right, unavoidably detained. If you are at all nervous,\r\n_get Jones to sleep with you!_’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 6._--Lady Manners and her daughters drove me down to Osterley.\r\nThe great wide park looked dark and dull under a leaden sky, the house\r\ngloomy and ghostly as Bleak House. The old Duchess, stumping about with\r\nher inlaid ebony stick, seemed part of the place. I dined at Sir Edward\r\nBlackett’s, a beautiful house with Raffaellesque and pink tapestry\r\ndecorations, prepared for the Duke of Gloucester on his marriage with\r\nthe Waldegrave, but never lived in by him.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 7._--Dined with George Lefevre. Mr. Bright was there, said to be\r\nthe man who reviewed me so unmercifully in the _Athenæum_, and I was\r\nvery glad to see the kind of man he is. He talked incessantly, never\r\nallowing a word to any one else; still after a time one found out he was\r\ninteresting. He talked most of Miss Martineau, then of Hawthorne with\r\ngreat praise--‘the kindest, most generous of men and friends.’ Of his\r\nson, Julian Hawthorne, he said that he had ‘written a book which it took\r\n_very_ long to read.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 13._--An excursion with the Lefevres to the Rye House, which I\r\nknew so well in my boyhood. It was like spending an afternoon in\r\nHolland, so very Dutch are those long expanses of rich meadow-lands,\r\nthose streams with their boats and tall water-plants. We sat in burning\r\nsunshine to draw the old terra-cotta tower, and then had tea and eggs\r\nand bacon in the garden of the little inn, which was covered with\r\nscarlet geranium in full flower up to the attic windows.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 19._--The news of poor old Cousin Susan’s[263] death. It is the\r\nglueing down of another much-read page of life, which can never be seen\r\nagain. I feel ashamed of not grieving more for one whom I have known so\r\nwell, but have always more feared than loved. The agent wrote desiring\r\nme to come down at once, but, backed by Lady Barrington’s decision that\r\nI had better keep out of the way till the will was decided, I excused\r\nmyself. Yet I am sorry not to be at the funeral, and the old house of\r\nmany associations, and the little Beltingham chapel with its view over\r\nthe gleaming Tyne, are very constantly in my mind. All the cousins are\r\nquite sure that I am the heir, but I do not think that it is so. Cousin\r\nSusan knew that I did not wish it, and I have always urged the claims of\r\nthe Strathmore boys.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 20._--I have received from Milligan the news of Cousin Susan’s\r\nwill. It is exactly the will I begged her to make--all to Mr. Bowes for\r\nlife, then to the Strathmores. These pleasant boys deserve their good\r\nfortunes. I would only rather she had selected _one_ of them to have\r\nmore definitely preserved her memory.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 28._--After a party at Lowther Lodge, I went to Lady Marian\r\nAlford, whom I found with a very ancient aunt, Lady Elizabeth Dickens.\r\nLady Marian showed me her drawings. There was one glorious sketch of a\r\nRoman model, yet most unlike a model. ‘She is,’ said Lady Marian, ‘the\r\nmodel who is so hated by the other models because of her stateliness.\r\n“She walks down the Corso as if it belonged to her,” they say. She had\r\ntwo beautiful children--a boy and a girl. Last time I went to Rome, I\r\nsaw her alone. “Where is your boy?” I asked.--“Oh, dead,” she\r\nanswered.--“And the girl?”--“Oh, dead, _dead_ too,” she replied,\r\npressing her hands to her forehead. And I pitied her, and I asked her\r\nabout it, and she said, “I will tell you how it was.” And she told me\r\nhow she was coming downstairs with her boy in her arms and the girl\r\nbehind her, and that just as she reached the house-door, a church-bell\r\nbegan to toll. “E un giustiziáto!” said one of the neighbours. And then,\r\nshe could not tell how, it was somehow borne in upon her that her\r\nboy--her son--might, if he grew up, also some day fall into sin, also\r\nsome day, perhaps, even be _giustiziáto_; and she turned round to the\r\nMadonna on the wall, and prayed that, if it were to be so, if such agony\r\nwere possible for her, that she would take her son _then_, that she\r\nwould take him away _then_, from the evil to come. And her husband, who\r\nheard her, said angrily, “Che sono queste stragonfiáte;” and he beat\r\nher; but the Madonna had heard her, and that night her boy was taken\r\nill, and in twenty-four hours he was dead.\r\n\r\n“‘And then she said, “That night I went again to the Madonna, and I\r\nsaid, ‘You have taken my boy, and, oh! if I may ever have _arrossire_\r\nfor my girl, take the girl also, take her away in her innocence;’ _e la\r\nMadonna mi ha fatto anche questa caritá_, and I, I am alone, but my\r\nchildren are safe.”’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 1._--To Holland House, most lovely in all the freshness of\r\nnew-mown hay, and the old elm avenue dewy from a shower. It was a\r\ndelight to see Mrs. Augustus Craven, altered from the lovely ‘Pauline de\r\nla Ferronays,’ but still beautiful, and I had the happiness of finding\r\nthat she liked to talk to me about her loved and lost ones.\r\n\r\n“A very interesting dinner at Miss Davenport Bromley’s. Signor\r\nFrancheschi described his life in Corsica, especially the weird women,\r\nwho come like the Fates, as hired mourners, to bewail the dead, yet\r\nthrow themselves so completely into their profession that they become\r\nquite absorbed in grief, and torrents of tears flow down their cheeks.\r\n\r\n“One night he had to travel. In a desolate road he saw two strange\r\nghastly horsemen approaching, with men walking on either side of their\r\nhorses and holding them. The moonlight glared upon their fixed and\r\nhorrid countenances. As they came near he heard the footmen talking to\r\nthem. ‘We must hasten; they are waiting for you; they are even now\r\nlamenting you.’ Then he saw that the riders were dead. They were\r\nmurdered men found by the highway, and had been set on horseback to be\r\nbrought home. In Corsica it is the custom never to cease speaking to the\r\ndead.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 7._--A capital party at Lowther Lodge to meet Princess Louise and\r\nLord Lorne. The garden was illuminated with magnesium light, and looked\r\nboth beautiful and--boundless!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOWTHER LODGE.][264]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 15._--Luncheon at Lady Combermere’s, where Lord Houghton\r\ndescribed his experience of executions. He had been to numbers of those\r\nin Newgate. Up to the time of George III. the sign-manual was necessary\r\nfor every execution, and it was an odd thing that George III., usually a\r\nhumane man, used to hang every one. He would sit at the council-board\r\nand ask each of the ministers in turn whether a man was to suffer death.\r\nThey would bow their heads in assent. Lord Melbourne was especially\r\nready to do this when he was sitting at the council-board. One day,\r\nhowever, there was a case of a man who had murdered his wife under most\r\nbrutal circumstances. The evidence was quite incontrovertible, and all\r\nwere surprised that Lord Melbourne, usually so ready, shrugged his\r\nshoulders and seemed to have the greatest difficulty in making up his\r\nmind to give an assent to the death-warrant. One of the ministers, in\r\ngoing out, asked why it was. ‘Why, poor man, those women are so damned\r\nprovoking,’ said Lord Melbourne.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Browning said he recollected seeing as many as twenty-one persons\r\nsitting together on the condemned bench in Newgate Chapel, many only for\r\nstealing a handkerchief. One day in chapel he was jostled by some one\r\npushing in past him, and turned round annoyed. ‘I beg your pardon, sir,\r\nbut I am going to _suffer_,’ said the man.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 12._--Monday was a most beautiful day for the party at Chiswick,\r\nfor its beautiful Italian gardens with glorious cedars. All London was\r\nthere, including the Prince of Wales, with his little boy George, and\r\nthe Tecks.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 29._--Since I wrote last the curious episode of Mrs. L. has\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\n“On the 14th I left my lodgings in the afternoon to go to the Athenæum,\r\nwhen a tremendous cataract of rain came on, in which I took refuge in\r\nthe covered entry of Pall Mall Place. A number of other people took\r\nrefuge there also. Amongst them, I was attracted by the agonised face of\r\na woman crouching in a corner--a lady, for so she seemed by her face,\r\nand in a certain degree by her dress; for though her gown looked as if\r\nit had been dragged through every Slough of Despond in Europe, the rest\r\nof her dress seemed to belong to the better class. As for her\r\nexpression, I cannot forget it, it was of such agonised, hopeless,\r\nbewildered despair. I suppose I looked pityingly at her, for she turned\r\nto me, and in sharp wolfish accents said, ‘I am not a beggar, I am not,\r\nI am only starving to death, I am starving to _death_!’ I think I begged\r\nher to tell me what had brought her to such a pass; at any rate she told\r\nme--‘I am Mrs. L.’ To many this would not convey anything, but, from\r\nhaving always been occupied with architecture, it conveyed something to\r\nme, and I said, ‘What! the widow of L., the architect?’--‘Yes,’ she\r\nsaid, and she described in the same sharp, broken, gasping accents how\r\nshe had been with her husband in Paris at the time of the siege, and how\r\nhe had wished to get her away and had arranged for her escape to\r\nEngland, and how at the moment that he was parting with her and putting\r\na purse into her hand to pay the expenses of her journey, a shell burst\r\nnear them, and her jaw was blown off. ‘When I came to myself in the\r\nhospital,’ she said, ‘I found that the shell which had blown off my jaw,\r\nhad blown my husband to pieces.’ She then described how she came to\r\nEngland, and how the Soane Museum, which takes care of the widows of\r\narchitects, had given her a pension of £75 a year. ‘You wonder,’ she\r\ncontinued, ‘that, having this pension, I should have reached the\r\ncondition I am in, but the fact is I have been a very wicked woman. When\r\nour pension is granted, we take a vow never to lend money, which is\r\nabsolutely forbidden by the rules of the Museum; but a friend of mine\r\nwas in great want, and I trusted her and became security for her, and\r\nshe has absconded, and they have come upon me for the debt, and\r\nyesterday morning early all my things were seized, and I could not apply\r\nto the Museum, because then they would take away my pension, and I was\r\nturned adrift in the streets with nothing at all in the world.’ And then\r\nthe poor woman corrected herself and said, ‘I have told a lie. I have\r\nnot quite nothing in the world. I have a silk gown. I had that on when I\r\nwas turned out, but I knew it would be worse for me to spend a night\r\nhomeless in the streets in a silk gown, and I went to a servant I knew,\r\nand got her to take care of it for me, and to lend me the worst gown she\r\nhad.’\r\n\r\n“‘Since yesterday morning,’ she said, ‘I have tasted nothing whatever.\r\nYou wonder I have not fainted. I have not done that because I am so\r\ndreadfully ill; I am in a burning fever. Yesterday I walked up to\r\nHampstead, because there was a governess I knew there, and I thought she\r\nwould help me; but when I arrived, I found her gone to Scotland with her\r\nfamily, and I walked all about Hampstead and Highgate, and the police\r\ninsulted me, they did not protect me, they insulted me worst of all; and\r\nall through the day I have walked in the streets.’ I asked her, ‘Have\r\nyou no friend in the world?’--‘Yes,’ she said, ‘I have one person who is\r\na friend; at least there is one person who I think would help me if I\r\ncould get to her, because my mother was once very kind to her, and that\r\nis Mrs. H. of the Mansfield Park School at Uxbridge, and to her, if I\r\ncould have even a cup of coffee to strengthen me, I should set out and\r\nwalk.’\r\n\r\n“I got her to go and have some tea, which, as I foresaw, made her\r\nviolently sick; and then, when she was a little better, I sent her by\r\nthe train to Uxbridge. Immediately returning to the Athenæum, I wrote a\r\nlady who lives close to Uxbridge, briefly telling her the story, that\r\nMrs. L. would probably arrive very ill, perhaps almost dying, and\r\nbegging her to go at once to Mansfield Park and look after her.\r\n\r\n“This was on Saturday. On Sunday there is no postal delivery. On Monday\r\nmorning I received two letters. One was from Mrs. H., overwhelmingly\r\ngrateful for what I had been able to do for Mrs. L., saying that she had\r\nreceived benefits from her mother which nothing could ever repay, and\r\nthat she had been only too thankful to receive and care for the\r\ndaughter. The other letter was from the lady to whom I had written,\r\nsaying that there was no such place as Mansfield Park, that there was no\r\nsuch person as Mrs. L., and enclosing letters from the police and\r\npost-office at Uxbridge certifying this. I explained this in my own mind\r\nby remembering that, while telling me her story under the entry, Mrs. L.\r\nhad said, ‘There is a little affectation about the name of Mansfield\r\nPark; it misleads people, for after all it is only a farmhouse.’\r\n\r\n“On Monday evening the servant at my lodgings said that Mrs. L. herself\r\nhad called: I was gone out to dinner. The next morning before I was up\r\nshe came again, and waited till I was dressed.\r\n\r\n“She was then quite calm and happy. She told how, when she got to\r\nUxbridge, after being dreadfully ill in the train, her heart failed\r\nher--‘perhaps after all Mrs. H. would not receive her.’ However, she\r\ndescribed with tears the touching kindness of Mrs. H.--that she had\r\nwashed her, dressed her, put her in her own bed, tended her, and finally\r\ngiven her a cheque for £20, which she showed me. Her brother also, a\r\ntravelling wine merchant in France, whom she had not seen for years, and\r\nto whom she had written without a hope of finding him, had also\r\ntelegraphed that he was on his way to her assistance.\r\n\r\n“She was overwhelmingly grateful to me.\r\n\r\n“Then I asked her of her past. She said she had been the daughter of a\r\nplanter in Havannah, but her fine voice induced her, against the will of\r\nher family, early to take to a public life. At the Exhibition of 1851\r\nshe (as Mademoiselle Mori) sang the anthem of which Jenny Lind sang one\r\nverse. She afterwards became a sculptress, and studied under Gibson at\r\nRome (and she described his peculiar studio accurately). She was his\r\nonly female pupil, and had the charge of his studio. He taught her his\r\nmode of colouring marble, and in her statue of ‘Waiting for the Spring,’\r\nshe used it in colouring the primroses and violets in a girl’s lap. The\r\nQueen bought this statue in the Exhibition building of 1862 before the\r\nExhibition opened. Then she married Mr. L. and went to Paris.\r\n\r\n“‘While I was in Paris,’ she said, ‘a very curious thing happened to me.\r\nI gave birth to three boys at once. When such an event occurs in France,\r\nthe sovereigns are always god-parents, and the Emperor and Empress were\r\npleased to have the christening of my three boys in Notre Dame, where\r\nthey stood sponsors at the font.’--‘And are the boys all dead?’ I said.\r\n‘Oh, dear no, they are all alive.’--‘Then where in the world are they?’\r\nI said. ‘Oh, they live with the Empress: she would not part with them,\r\nand my three boys are her little pages. Now they are gone with her into\r\nSpain to see her mother.’\r\n\r\n“She then described how the Empress often sent her money to go down to\r\nChislehurst to see her boys, and how the Prince Imperial often called to\r\nsee her, and called her ‘Grannie’ because of the boys, or left her a £10\r\nnote. ‘I should have gone at once to the Empress had she been in\r\nEngland,’ said Mrs. L., ‘but I would have died rather than have begged\r\nfrom any one: I would have died on a doorstep.’--‘Then what made you\r\nconfide in me?’ I asked. ‘Oh, surely you must see that,’ she replied.\r\n‘Of course you must see that. It was the likeness. Of course people must\r\nhave told you of the great, the wonderful likeness before. I was quite\r\nprepared for death, I had made up my mind to die, and then God in His\r\ngreat mercy sent the likeness of my Emperor to me; and I knew then that\r\nGod did not mean me to die yet.’\r\n\r\n“She wants to paint a picture in memory of what she calls my ‘saving\r\nher.’[265]\r\n\r\n“On the 18th, I had an interesting visit to Apsley House, for which the\r\nDuke had sent me the following order:--‘Admit Mr. Hare to see Apsley\r\nHouse on any day _on which the street outside is dry_.’ The street was\r\nquite dry, and, moreover, I went in a cab and arrived perfectly spick\r\nand span; but the servant laughed as he produced a pair of huge list\r\nslippers to go on over my boots, before I was allowed to go into any of\r\nthe rooms. ‘His Grace left these himself, and desired you should wear\r\nthem when you came.’ Yet the floors of Apsley House are not even\r\npolished.\r\n\r\n“On the 19th I went to Lady Ducie’s, to see the Macdonald family act the\r\nPilgrim’s Progress. They go through the whole of the second part, George\r\nMacdonald,[266] his wife, his twelve children, and two adopted children.\r\nChristiana (the eldest daughter) was the only one who acted well.\r\nNevertheless, the whole effect was touching, and the audience cried most\r\nsympathetically as Christiana embraced her children to go over the great\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n“On the 21st there was a delightful party at Holland House to meet the\r\nPrince of Wales, and on Wednesday I was thankful to come home.\r\n\r\n“Never has little Holmhurst been pleasanter than this year, and I have\r\nso enjoyed being alone, the repose of the intense quietude, the radiance\r\nof the flowers, the delicious sea-breezes through windows open to the\r\nground, the tame doves flitting and cooing in the branches of the tall\r\nlime-tree.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n“_August 6, 1877._--I came home on Wednesday week, and have been alone\r\never since, and over head and ears in work. I have seen nobody except\r\nlast Tuesday, when, though I thought no one knew I was at home,\r\nfourteen afternooners appeared. Miss Hamilton, who has taken a fancy to\r\ndo my portrait, has done it very cleverly against a window, with ivy\r\nhanging down outside, only it is a sentimental suggestion of\r\n\r\n    ‘He sat at the window all day long\r\n     And watched the falling leaves.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOLMHURST, THE POULTRY-YARD.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 19._--I have had a pleasant visit of three days to Cobham, and\r\nfelt much inclined to accede to Lord and Lady Darnley’s wish at the end,\r\nthat I would consider my visit just begun, and stay another three days.\r\nIt is indeed a glorious old place externally, and the gardens and\r\nimmense variety of walks under grand old trees, are enchanting in hot\r\nweather. I had many happy ‘sittings out’ and talks with Lady Darnley,\r\nand could not sufficiently admire, though I always observe it, how her\r\nperfectly serene nature enables her to carry out endless people-seeing,\r\nboundless literary pursuit, and inexhaustible good works, without ever\r\nfussing herself or any one else, leaving also time to enter into all the\r\nminute difficulties of her friends in the varied gyrations of their\r\nlives.... I was taken to see Cowling Castle, a romantic old place; just\r\non the edge of those marshes of the Thames which Dickens describes so\r\nvividly. We also saw his house, close to Dover road.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Walton Heath, Oct. 6._--After a delightful visit from Harry Lee at\r\nHolmhurst, I have come here to Miss Davenport Bromley at a quaint\r\ncottage, partly built out of a church, in a corner of the vast Walton\r\nHeath, but full of artistic comfort and brightness within. We drove on\r\nThursday to Box Hill, which is most beautiful, the high steep chalky\r\nground covered with such a luxuriance of natural wood, box grown into\r\ntrees and the billows of pink and blue distance so wonderfully luxuriant\r\nand wooded. The time of year is quite beautiful, and all the last\r\nfestival of nature in the clematis wreaths and the bryony with its red\r\nberries dancing from tree to tree.\r\n\r\n“We have been to see a quaint old house of the Heathcotes. There is a\r\ngreat stone hall with a high gallery, from which a young lady threw\r\nherself in her rage at her lover marrying some one else, and was killed\r\non the spot. Her picture hangs on the staircase wall, and her ghost\r\nwalks on the stairs, pretty, in white, something like a shepherdess. A\r\nhousemaid cut a great cross in the picture, ‘to let the ghost out,’ as\r\nthe old woman who showed the house said, and the hole has never been\r\nmended. This country is full of little traditions. There is a green lane\r\nclose by, down which a headless lady walks, and a phantom coach drives\r\nalong the road: a countryman who met old M. de Berg on the common\r\ndeclared that he had seen it--that it had driven over him.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday we went to Gatton (Lord Monson’s), which formerly belonged to\r\nSir Mark Wood. It is a curious place: the ugly church fitted inside with\r\nbeautiful Flemish carving and glass, and the house having a hall of\r\ncoloured marbles, copied from the Corsini Chapel at Rome--minus the\r\nupper story.\r\n\r\n“I have much enjoyed learning to know Miss Bromley better. She is the\r\nkindest of women, wonderfully clever and full of insight into every\r\nminutest beauty of nature. Her devotion to animals, especially pugs, is\r\na passion. Another pleasure has been finding Mrs. Henry de Bunsen here.\r\nShe told me--\r\n\r\n“‘There was, and there is still, living in Cadogan Place, a lady of\r\nmiddle age, who is clever, charming, amiable, even handsome, but who has\r\nthe misfortune of having--a wooden leg. Daily, for many years, she was\r\naccustomed to amble every morning on her wooden leg down Cadogan Place,\r\nand to take the air in the Park. It was her principal enjoyment.\r\n\r\n“‘One day she discovered that in these walks she was constantly followed\r\nby a gentleman. When she turned, he turned: where she went, he went: it\r\nwas most disagreeable. She determined to put an end to it by staying at\r\nhome, and for some days she did not go out at all. But she missed her\r\nwalks in the Park very much, and after a time she thought her follower\r\nmust have forgotten all about her, and she went out as before. The same\r\ngentleman was waiting, he followed her, and at length suddenly came up\r\nto her in the Park and presented her with a letter. He said that, as a\r\nstranger, he must apologise for speaking to her, but that he must\r\nimplore her to take the letter, and read it when she got home: it was of\r\ngreat importance. She took the letter, and when she got home she read\r\nit, and found that it contained a violent declaration of love and a\r\nproposal of marriage. She was perfectly furious. She desired her lawyer\r\nto enclose the letter to the writer, and say that she could not find\r\nwords to describe her sense of his ungentlemanly conduct, especially\r\ncruel to one afflicted as she was with a wooden leg.\r\n\r\n“‘Several years elapsed, and the lady was paying a visit to some friends\r\nin the country, when the conversation frequently turned upon a friend of\r\nthe house who was described as one of the most charming, generous, and\r\nbeneficent of mankind. So delightful was the description, that the lady\r\nwas quite anxious to see the original, and was enchanted when she heard\r\nthat he was likely to come to the house. But when he arrived, she\r\nrecognised with consternation her admirer of the Park. He did not,\r\nhowever, recur to their former meeting, and after a time, when she knew\r\nhim well, she grew to esteem him exceedingly, and at last, when he\r\nrenewed his proposal after an intimate acquaintance, she accepted him\r\nand married him.\r\n\r\n“‘He took her to his country-house, and for six weeks they were\r\nentirely, uncloudedly happy. Then there came a day upon which he\r\nannounced that he was obliged to go up to London on business. His wife\r\ncould not go with him because the house in Cadogan Place was dismantled\r\nfor the summer. “I should regret this more,” he said, “but that where\r\ntwo lives are so completely, so entirely united as ours are, there ought\r\nto be the most absolute confidence on either side. Therefore, while I am\r\naway, I shall leave you my keys. Open my desk, read all my letters and\r\njournals, make yourself mistress of my whole life. Above all,” he said,\r\n“there is one cupboard in my dressing-room which contains certain\r\nmemorials of my past peculiarly sacred to me, which I should like you to\r\nmake yourself acquainted with.” The wife heard with concern of her\r\nhusband’s intended absence, but she was considerably buoyed up under the\r\nidea of the three days in which they were to be separated by the thought\r\nof the very interesting time she would have. She saw her husband off\r\nfrom the door, and as soon as she heard the wheels of his carriage die\r\naway in the distance, she clattered away as fast as she could upon her\r\nwooden leg to the dressing-room, and in a minute she was down on all\r\nfours before the cupboard he had described.\r\n\r\n“‘She unlocked the cupboard. It contained two shelves. On each shelf was\r\na long narrow parcel sewn up in canvas. She felt a tremor of horror as\r\nshe looked at them, she did not know why. She lifted down the first\r\nparcel, and it had a label on the outside. She trembled so she could\r\nscarcely read it. It was inscribed--“In memory of my dear wife Elizabeth\r\nAnne, who died on the 24th of August 1864.” With quivering fingers she\r\nsought for a pair of scissors and ripped open the canvas, and it\r\ncontained--a wooden leg!\r\n\r\n“‘With indescribable horror she lifted down the other parcel, of the\r\nsame form and size. It also bore a label--“In memory of my dearest wife\r\nWilhelmine, who died on the 6th of March 1869,” and she opened it, and\r\nit contained--another wooden leg!\r\n\r\n“‘Instantly she rose from her knees. “It is evident,” she said, “that I\r\nam married to a Blue Beard--a monster who _collects_ wooden legs. This\r\nis not the time for sentiment, this is the time for action,” and she\r\nswept her jewels and some miniatures that she had into a handbag and she\r\nclattered away on her own wooden leg by the back shrubberies to the\r\nhighroad--and there she saw the butcher’s cart passing, and she hailed\r\nit, and was driven by the butcher to the nearest station, where she just\r\ncaught the next train to London, intending to make good her escape that\r\nnight to France and to leave no trace behind her.\r\n\r\n“‘But she had not consulted Bradshaw, and she found she had some hours\r\nto wait in London before the tidal train started. Then she could not\r\nresist employing them in going to reproach the people at whose house she\r\nhad met her husband, and she told them what she had found. To her\r\namazement they were not the least surprised. “Yes,” they said, “yes, we\r\nthought he ought to have told you: we do not wonder you were astonished.\r\nYes, indeed, we knew dear Elizabeth Anne very well; she was indeed a\r\nmost delightful person, the most perfect of women and of wives, and when\r\nshe was taken away, the whole light seemed blotted out of Arthur’s life,\r\nthe change was so very terrible. We thought he would never rally his\r\nspirits again; but then, after two years, he met dearest Wilhelmine, to\r\nwhom he was first attracted by her having the same affliction which was\r\ncharacteristic of her predecessor. And Wilhelmine was perhaps even a\r\nmore charming person than Elizabeth Anne, and made her husband’s life\r\nuncloudedly happy. But she too was, alas! early snatched away, and then\r\nit was as if the whole world was cut from under Arthur’s feet, until at\r\nlast he met you, with the same peculiarity which was endeared to him by\r\ntwo lost and loved ones, and we believe that with you he has been even\r\nmore entirely, more uncloudedly happy than he was either with Wilhelmine\r\nor Elizabeth Anne.\r\n\r\n“‘And the wife was so charmed by what she heard, that it gave quite a\r\nnew aspect to affairs. She went home by the next train. She was there\r\nwhen her husband returned; and ever since they have lived perfectly\r\nhappily between his house in the country and hers in Cadogan Place.’\r\n\r\n“Mrs. De Bunsen said that a cousin of hers was repeating this story when\r\ndining at the Balfours’. Suddenly he saw that his host and hostess were\r\nboth telegraphing frantic signals to him, and by a great effort he\r\nturned it off. The lady of the wooden leg and her husband were both\r\namongst the guests.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Milford Cottage, Oct. 8._--I came here with Miss Bromley on Saturday\r\nto visit Mrs. Greville and her most engaging mother, Mrs. Thellusson. It\r\nis a red house, standing almost in the village street, but with a\r\nFrench-looking garden behind, with clipped hedges and orange trees in\r\ntubs. It was left to Mrs. Greville by her husband, an old gentleman whom\r\nshe married when the Thellussons were ruined, and he said, ‘You had\r\nbetter marry me; there is nothing else that I can do for you.’ He always\r\ntreated her with the greatest generosity and kindness, but died very\r\nsuddenly, intending to leave his wife very rich. There was, however,\r\nsome mistake about the will, and she only inherited this cottage and\r\njust enough to live upon. I found at Milford, Lady Elizabeth Bryan, a\r\nPaget, who goes out visiting with four dogs, one of whom, Constance\r\nKent, is most beautiful, and she has adopted a little cousin and\r\npresented her with six-and-thirty dolls. I went to see the adopted\r\ndaughter in bed; two little dogs were cuddled in her bosom, and seven\r\ndolls lay at her feet with their heads out. Lately, the little girl has\r\ndisplayed signs of vanity, paraded her small person before a mirror, and\r\nexulted in fine clothes, and on these occasions she is always dressed in\r\n‘Sukey,’ a little workhouse girl’s gown, to remind her that ‘in the\r\nsight of God she is no better.’\r\n\r\n“This afternoon I have been with Mrs. Greville to Mr. Tennyson at\r\nHaselmere. It is a wild, high, brown heath, with ragged edges of birch,\r\nand an almost limitless view of blue Sussex distances. Jammed into a\r\nhollow is the house, a gothic house, built by Mr. Knowles, the editor of\r\nthe _Nineteenth Century_--‘that young bricklayer fellow that Alfred is\r\nso fond of,’ as Mr. Carlyle calls him. Though the place is a bleak,\r\nwind-stricken height, where the flowers in the garden can never sit\r\nstill, the house is pleasant inside and well and simply furnished, but\r\nis without any library whatever. Tennyson is older looking than I\r\nexpected, so that his _unkempt_ appearance signifies less. He has an\r\nabrupt, bearish manner, and seems thoroughly hard and _un_poetical: one\r\nwould think of him as a man in whom the direst prose of life was\r\nabsolutely ingrained. Mrs. Greville kissed his hand as he came in, which\r\nhe received without any protest. He asked if I would like to go out, and\r\nwe walked round the gardens. By way of breaking the silence I said, ‘How\r\nfine your arbūtus is.’--‘Well, I would say arbūtus,’ he answered,\r\n‘otherwise you are as bad as the gardeners, who say Clemātis.’ When\r\nwe returned to the house, Hallam Tennyson brought in his mother very\r\ntenderly and put her on a sofa. She is a very sweet-looking woman, with\r\n‘the glittering blue eyes’ which fascinated Carlyle, and a lady-abbess\r\nlook from her head-dress--a kind of veil. Mrs. Greville revealed that\r\nshe had broken her promise of not repeating an unpublished poem of\r\nTennyson’s by reciting it to Mr. Carlyle, who said, ‘But did Alfred give\r\nyou leave to say it?’ and Tennyson said, ‘You are the wickedest old\r\nwoman I ever met with: it is most _profligate_ conduct’--and he half\r\nmeant it too. Tennyson then insisted that I should tell him some\r\nstories. I did not like it, but found it was no use to resist; I should\r\nhave to do it in the end. He asked for ‘a village tragedy,’ so I told\r\nhim the story of Caroline Crowhurst: he said he should write it in a\r\nplay or a poem. Then I told him the stories of Mademoiselle von Raasloff\r\nand of Croglin Grange. He was atrociously bad audience, and constantly\r\ninterrupted with questions. He himself repeated a little story, which\r\nMr. Greene of the ‘English History’ had told him--of a man who felt that\r\nhis fiddle, to which he was devoted, was the source of temptation to him\r\nby leading him to taverns where he got drunk. On the Mississippi river,\r\nhe said, he heard a voice saying to him that he must destroy the fiddle;\r\nso he went down, kissed the fiddle, and then broke it to pieces. ‘_I_\r\nput in that kiss,’ said Tennyson, ‘because I thought it sounded better.’\r\n\r\n“On the whole, the wayward poet leaves a favourable impression. He could\r\nscarcely be less egotistic with all the flattery he has, and I am glad\r\nto have seen him so quietly. The maid who opened the door was Mrs.\r\nCameron’s beautiful model, and there were pictures of her by Mrs.\r\nCameron all about the house.\r\n\r\n“For the poet’s bearish manners the Tennyson family are to blame, in\r\nmaking him think himself a demigod. One day, on arriving at Mrs.\r\nGreville’s, he said at once, ‘Give me a pipe; I want to smoke.’ She at\r\nonce went off by herself down the village to the shop, and returning\r\nwith two pipes, offered them to him with all becoming subservience. He\r\nnever looked at her or thanked her, but, as he took them, growled out,\r\n‘Where are the matches? I suppose now you’ve forgotten the\r\nmatches!’--‘Oh dear! I never thought of those.’\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Greville has a note of Tennyson’s framed. It is a very pretty\r\nnote; but it begins ‘Dear Madwoman.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Babworth, Oct. 14._--This house overflows with loveliness in the way\r\nof amateur art, and the drawings of its mistress, Mrs. Bridgeman\r\nSimpson, are most beautiful. She is the kindest and most good-natured of\r\nhostesses.... Yesterday we went to Sandbeck, an ugly dull house in a\r\nflat, and looking bare within from paucity of furniture. Lord\r\nScarborough, once a bold huntsman, is now patiently awaiting a second\r\nstroke of paralysis in a wheel-chair. Lumley, a pleasant boy, just going\r\nto join his regiment at Dublin, drove me after luncheon to Roche Abbey,\r\na very pretty ruin in a glen.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 15._--Mrs. Simpson’s very charming Polish sister-in-law, Mrs.\r\nDrummond Baring, recounted yesterday evening a curious story out of the\r\nreminiscences of her childhood, of which her husband from knowledge\r\nconfirmed every fact. Her father, Count Potocka, lived in Martinique.\r\nHis wife had been married before, and her beautiful daughter, Minetta,\r\nidolised by her second husband, had made a happy marriage with the\r\nMarquis de San Luz, and resided at Port Royal about five miles from her\r\nparents. The father was a great naturalist, and had the greatest\r\ninterest in introducing and naturalising all kinds of plants in the West\r\nIndies. Amongst other plants, he was most anxious to introduce\r\nstrawberries. Every one said he would fail, and the neighbouring\r\ngardeners especially said so much about it that it was a positive\r\nannoyance to them when his plants all seemed to succeed, and he had a\r\nlarge bed of strawberries in flower. His step-daughter, Minetta, came to\r\nsee them, and he always said to her that, when the strawberries were\r\nripe, she should have the first fruit.\r\n\r\n“A ball was given at Port Royal by the Governor, and there her parents\r\nsaw Minetta, beautiful and radiant as ever; but she left the ball early,\r\nfor her child was not well. As she went away, she said to her\r\nstepfather, ‘Remember my strawberries.’\r\n\r\n“Her parents returned home in the early morning, and a day and a night\r\nsucceeded. Towards dawn on the second morning, when night was just\r\nbreaking into the first grey daylight, the mother felt an irresistible\r\nrestlessness, and getting up and going to the window, she looked out. A\r\nfigure in white was moving to and fro amongst the strawberries,\r\ncarefully examining each plant and looking under the leaves. She awoke\r\nher husband, who said at once, ‘It is one of the gardeners, who are so\r\njealous that they have come to destroy my plants;’ and jumping up, he\r\nput on his _gola_--a sort of dressing-gown wrapper worn in\r\nMartinique--and, taking his gun, rushed out. On first going out, he saw\r\nthe figure in white moving before him, but as he came up to the\r\nstrawberry beds it seemed to have disappeared. He was surprised, and\r\nturning round towards the house, saw his wife making agonised signs to\r\nhim to come back. Such was her livid aspect, that he threw down his gun\r\nupon the ground and ran in to her. He found her in a dead faint upon the\r\nfloor. When she recovered, she said that she had watched him from the\r\nwindow as he went out, and that, as he reached the strawberry beds, the\r\nfigure seemed to turn round, and she saw--like a person seen through a\r\nveil and through the glass of a window, and, though perfectly distinct,\r\ntransparent--her daughter Minetta. Soon after describing this, she was\r\nseized with violent convulsions. Her husband was greatly alarmed about\r\nher, and was just sending off for the doctor, who lived at some\r\ndistance, when a rider on a little Porto Rico pony came clattering into\r\nthe court. They thought it was the doctor, but it was not; it was a\r\nmessenger from Port Royal to say that Minetta was dead. She had been\r\nseized with a chill on returning from the ball, and it had turned to\r\nfatal diphtheria. In her last hours, when her throat was so swelled and\r\nhot, she had constantly said, ‘Oh, my throat is so hot! Oh, if I had\r\nonly some of those strawberries!’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Thoresby, Oct. 17._--Lord Manvers sent for me after luncheon three\r\ndays ago, and we came with a horse fleet as the wind through the green\r\nlanes of Clumber, and across part of the (Sherwood) forest, to this\r\nimmense modern palace by Salvin. All around is forest. No one was at\r\nhome when I arrived, so I went out for a walk, and was joined by Lord\r\nManvers on returning.... Lady Manvers is quite delightful, and so are\r\nher son and daughter, so I have been very glad of two days alone with\r\nthe family; and the forest is enchanting from its varieties of gnarled\r\noak, silver birch, endlessly contorted fir, and gigantic beeches, with\r\never-varying lights on the golden and crimson fern in its first\r\nbeautiful decay. Now guests have arrived, including Mr. Frederick\r\nTayler, the artist,[267] whose blottesque treatment of the green in the\r\nforest with only gamboge, indigo, and sepia is very interesting to see.\r\nHe was very funny about the late Lord Manvers, who was a wit, and who,\r\nwhen Lord Ossington was rather boastful about his lake, said--‘Come,\r\ncome now, Ossington, don’t speak of a lake; just wipe it up and say no\r\nmore about it.’\r\n\r\n“In the afternoon we drove through ‘the Catwhins’ to Clumber--a dull\r\nugly low-lying house. There is much fine china, but it is a dreary\r\nplace.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Glamis Castle, Oct. 26._--I had a delightful visit to the salt of the\r\nearth at Hutton,[268] where Mr. and Mrs. Pease were entertaining a large\r\nparty, chiefly of semi-Quaker relations, including Miss Fox of Falmouth,\r\nwho is most interesting and agreeable. Mrs. Pease is as delightful as\r\nshe is beautiful, and the place is an oasis of good works of every kind.\r\nThence I came here, meeting Mr. Waldegrave Leslie and Lady Rothes at the\r\nstation. As we drove up to the haunted castle at night, its many turrets\r\nlooked most eerie and weird against the moonlit sky, and its windows\r\nblazed with red light. The abundance of young life inside takes off the\r\nsolemn effect--the number of charming children, the handsome cordial\r\nboys, the winning gracious mistress; only Lord Strathmore himself has an\r\never sad look. The Bishop of Brechin, who was a great friend of the\r\nhouse, felt this strange sadness so deeply that he went to Lord\r\nStrathmore, and, after imploring him in the most touching manner to\r\nforgive the intrusion into his private affairs, said how, having heard\r\nof the strange secret which oppressed him, he could not help entreating\r\nhim to make use of his services as an ecclesiastic, if he could in any\r\nway, by any means, be of use to him. Lord Strathmore was deeply moved,\r\nthough he said that he thanked him, but that in his most unfortunate\r\nposition _no one_ could ever help him. He has built a wing to the\r\ncastle, in which all the children and all the servants sleep. The\r\nservants will not sleep in the house, and the children are not allowed\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\n“I found a large party here, and was agreeably surprised to see Lady\r\nWynford come down to dinner. Then Lady Holmesdale appeared, with her\r\npiteous little white-mouse aspect; Mr. and the charming Mrs.\r\nStreatfeild, Lady Strathmore’s sister; Miss Erica Robertson, and Lord\r\nand Lady Rosehill.\r\n\r\n“There is much of interest in the life here--the huge clock telling the\r\nhours; the gathering in early morning for prayers by the chaplain in the\r\nchapel, through a painted panel of which some think that the secret\r\nchamber is concealed, though others maintain that it is entered through\r\nLord Strathmore’s study, and occupies the space above ‘the crypt’--an\r\narmour-hung hall where we all meet for dinner, at which the old Lion of\r\nLyon--gold, for holding a whole bottle of claret, which the old lords\r\nused to toss off at a draught--is produced. There are lions everywhere.\r\nHuge gilt lions stand on either side in front of the drawing-room\r\nfireplace, lions are nut-crackers, a lion sits on the letter-box, the\r\nvery door-scraper is guarded by two lions.\r\n\r\n“The boys are charming, so very nice that one cannot believe any curse\r\ncan affect them. Claudie (Glamis) is very handsome, and looks strikingly\r\nso in his Scotch dress. Frank is ill now, but most engaging.\r\n\r\n“To-day, as I was drawing, Mr. Waldegrave Leslie gave a curious account\r\nof his life at Lady Rothes’ castle--that they themselves inhabit the\r\nghost-room, and that the ghost comes frequently, and not only groans,\r\nbut _howls_; they often hear it. When Lady Rothes’ brother died, the\r\nepiscopal service was read over him in the house by a clergyman, and the\r\nghost then howled so horribly that the service was quite inaudible, and\r\neventually had to be stopped. He said they did not mind the ghost, but\r\nthat Lady Rothes’ Dandie Dinmont dog was distracted with terror when it\r\ncame, and crept upon the bed quivering convulsively all over.\r\n\r\n“Lady Rosehill has been meeting Mr. (Dicky) Doyle, the genial fairy\r\nlover, who told her that one day when a man was walking down Pall Mall\r\nwith a most tremendous swagger, somebody walked up to him and said,\r\n‘Sir, will you have the kindness to tell me, _are_ you anybody in\r\nparticular?’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 29._--Yesterday was Sunday, and we had three services in the\r\nchapel, which is painted all over with figures of saints by the same man\r\nwho executed the bad paintings of the Scottish kings at Holyrood. The\r\nsermons from Mr. Beck, the chaplain, head of ‘the Holy Cross’ in\r\nScotland, were most curious: the first--apropos of All Saints--being a\r\nmere catalogue of saints, S. Etheldreda, S. Kenneth, S. Ninian, &c.,\r\nand their virtues; and describing All Saints’ festival as ‘the Mart of\r\nHoliness’: the second--apropos of All Souls--speaking of prayers for the\r\ndead as a duty inculcated by the Church in all ages, and taking the\r\nwords of Judas Maccabeus as a text.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Gorhambury, Nov. 20._--It was dark when I reached the St. Albans\r\nStation yesterday. Lord Verulam’s carriage was in waiting for guests: I\r\ngot into it with three others. ‘Lord Beaconsfield was with us in the\r\ntrain,’ said the young lady of the party, ‘and I am sure he is going to\r\nGorhambury, and oh! I _am_ so glad he has taken a fly.’ We drove up to\r\nthe great porticoed house in the dark, and a small winding staircase\r\ntook us to a great lofty hall, furnished as a sitting-room. Here we\r\nfound Lady Verulam, two of her daughters, Lady Catherine Weyland, &c.\r\nOther guests appeared at dinner--the sallow basilisk face of Lord\r\nBeaconsfield: his most amusing secretary, Montagu Corry: Lord Exeter,\r\nwith long black hair: Lady Exeter, tall, very graceful and\r\nrefined-looking, but with the coldest manner in the world: a young Lord\r\nMount-Charles: Scudamore Stanhope, remarkably pleasant: Charlie\r\nDuncombe, very pleasant too: Lady Mary Cecil: Dowager Lady Craven,\r\nalways most agreeable.\r\n\r\n“Lord Verulam is permanently lame and on two crutches, but most\r\nagreeable and kindly. This morning I sat to draw the ruin of Lord\r\nBacon’s house (Lady Craven saved it when it was going to be pulled\r\ndown). The place is full of relics of him, his observatory in the park:\r\nthe ‘Kissing Oak,’ beneath which Queen Elizabeth embraced him: the\r\n‘Queen’s Ride,’ used when she came to visit him: curious painted\r\nterra-cotta busts of his father and mother and of himself as a child, in\r\nthe library: and in the dining-room a large portrait of his brother,\r\nwhich he (the brother) painted himself, the most prominent feature being\r\nhis legs, of which he was evidently exceedingly proud.\r\n\r\n“In the afternoon I drove with Lady Exeter, Lady Catherine Weyland, and\r\nLady Jane Grimston to St. Albans, and went over the abbey with Mr.\r\nChapel, the delightfully enthusiastic clerk of the works, who repeatedly\r\nexclaimed, ‘It is the pride of my life, sir; it is the pride of my\r\nlife.’ He has most beautifully put together, from the fragments found,\r\nthe two great shrines of the place, of St. Alban and St. Amphipolis\r\n(Arthur Stanley doubts the existence of the latter saint, and thinks the\r\nname was only that of a cloak), not adding or inventing a single bit;\r\nand the whole interior of the abbey has been hitherto done in the same\r\nway, being perhaps the one church in England really restored, not\r\nremodelled. In returning we stopped at St. Michael’s to see the tomb of\r\nLord Bacon, represented as he sat in his chair--‘sic sedebat.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 21._--At dinner last night and all day Lord Beaconsfield seemed\r\nabsorbed, scarcely noticed any one, barely answered his hostess when\r\nspoken to. Montagu Corry[269] said that his chief declared that the\r\ngreatest pleasure in life was writing a book, because ‘in that way alone\r\nman could become a creator:’ that his habit was to make marionettes,\r\nand then to live with them for some months before he put them into\r\naction. Lately he had made some marionettes; now he was living with\r\nthem, and their society occupied him entirely.\r\n\r\n“To-day Lord Verulam showed me many of the relics of the house--the\r\ndecision of his ancestor, Judge Crook, releasing Hampden: a deed of\r\nfree-warren from Henry II. confirming to one of his ancestors another\r\ndeed of his grandfather Henry I.: the portrait of Edward Grimston\r\n(1460), the oldest known authentic portrait in England, representing a\r\nman who fought at Towton, but afterwards made peace with Edward IV.,\r\nlived in retirement, and is mentioned in the Paston Letters.\r\n\r\n“Lord Verulam told me of his discovery that Lord Lovat was seventy-three\r\nat the time of his execution, not eighty, as is generally affirmed. The\r\nsupposed date of his birth and the date of his learning to fence tend to\r\nconfirm this, and his _smiling_ when he looked upon his coffin-plate on\r\nthe scaffold and the line he quoted from Horace.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 25._--On Friday I drove with Lord Verulam in his victoria to\r\nWrothampstead. The old house there is one of the long many-gabled\r\nhouses, vine-covered, with windows and chimneys of moulded brick,\r\nstanding, backed by fine trees, in a brilliant garden. Inside it is\r\ngloriously panelled, and has a staircase approached by balustraded gates\r\nwith a tapestried room at the top of it. It belongs to a Mr. Lawes, who\r\nfor a long time was supposed to be wasting all his time and most of his\r\nmoney in chemistry, but at length by his chemistry he discovered a cheap\r\nway of making a valuable manure, and ‘Lawes’s manure’ has made him a\r\nmillionaire.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday we went to Tittenhanger, already familiar to me from Lady\r\nWaterford’s descriptions. It is a charming old house, utterly\r\nCromwellian, most attractive and engaging, depending for its effect upon\r\nits high overhanging roofs, and the simple, admirable brick ornaments of\r\nits windows. The rooms are full of beautiful pictures and china, but\r\nLady Caledon was not there, and it is always a loss not to see the owner\r\n_with_ a place.\r\n\r\n“It was on hearing some one mention this house that Sydney Smith made\r\nthe impromptu--\r\n\r\n    ‘Oh, pray, where is Tittenhanger?\r\n     Is it anywhere by Bangor?\r\n     Or, if it is not in Wales,\r\n     Can it, perhaps, be near Versailles?\r\n     Tell me, in the name of grace,\r\n     Is there really such a place?’\r\n\r\n“Lady Lilian Paulet was very absurd at dinner with her story of an\r\nAmerican who said that, going down Piccadilly, he met a mad dog, so, as\r\nhe could not avoid him, he thrust his hand down its throat and pulled\r\nout its inside; after which the dog ran on still, but it could no longer\r\nsay ‘bow-wow,’ it could only say ‘wow-bow.’\r\n\r\n“It was amusing _seeing_ Lord Beaconsfield at Gorhambury: _hear_ him I\r\nnever did, except when he feebly bleated out some brief and ghastly\r\nutterance. His is an extraordinary life. He told Lord Houghton that the\r\nwhole secret of his success was his power of never dwelling upon a\r\nfailure; he ‘had failed often, _constantly_ at first, yet had never\r\ndwelt on it, but always gone on to something else.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TITTENHANGER.][270]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Burghley, Nov. 29._--I have been glad to come to the place which is\r\noften called ‘the finest house in England’--a dictum in which I by no\r\nmeans agree. The guests are a row of elderly baronets of only hunting\r\nand Midland-county fame. An exception is Sir John Hay, a thorough old\r\n_gentleman_ (an Admiral) and very agreeable. I took a Miss Fowke in to\r\ndinner, and complained to her of the number of old baronets. ‘Yes,’ she\r\nsaid, ‘they are old and they are numerous, and the central one is my\r\nfather.’\r\n\r\n“The house is immense, but has little internal beauty. There is a series\r\nof stately rooms, dull and oppressive, with fine tapestry and china, and\r\na multitude of pictures with very fine names, almost all misnamed--a\r\ncopy of the well-known Bronzino of the Medici boy being called Edward\r\nVI.; a copy of the well-known Correggio in the National Gallery being\r\nmarked as an original by Angelica Kauffman, &c.[271] In a small closet\r\nis a number of jewelled trinkets, including Queen Elizabeth’s watch and\r\nthimble, and there hangs the gem of the picture collection--‘The Saviour\r\nBlessing the Elements,’ a very expressive but most unpleasing work of\r\nCarlo Dolci. It is the halo of the great Lord Burghley which gives the\r\nplace all its interest. He lies on his back in a scarlet robe under a\r\ncanopy in St. Martin’s Church at the entrance of the town, and close by\r\nis a cenotaph to his father and mother, who are buried at St.\r\nMargaret’s, Westminster. All the five churches of Stamford have merit,\r\nand the town is interesting and picturesque.\r\n\r\n“Lord Exeter, with his lank black hair and his wrinkled yellow\r\njack-boots high above the knee, looks like a soldier of Cromwell. In the\r\nevening he and the whole family dance incessantly to the music of a\r\nbarrel-organ, which they take it in turn to wind.[272]\r\n\r\n“The great idol of family adoration is ‘Telemachus’--the memory of\r\nTelemachus, or rather a whole dynasty of Telemachi, for they are now\r\narrived at Telemachus X. The bull Telemachus I. gained more than £1000\r\nat small county cattle-shows. His head is stuffed in the hall; his\r\nstatue in silver stands in the dining-room (where there are also silver\r\nstatues of Telemachus II. and III.), and his portrait hangs on the\r\nwall.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 6._--On Tuesday, at King’s Cross, I met Elizabeth Biddulph, Marie\r\nAdeane, Alethea Grenfell, and the Dalyells, and we came down together, a\r\nmerry party, to Hertford, whither the Robert Smiths sent to fetch us to\r\ntheir picturesque new house of Goldings. Alethea is full of the story of\r\nJagherds (near Corsham)--that ‘in the difficulty of finding a house\r\nthere suitable for the clergyman, an old manor-house was suggested,\r\nwhich seemed to meet all requisites. The Bishop (Ellicott) himself went\r\nto see it, and was quite delighted with it, and the clergyman went to\r\nreside there. But his servants would not stay, his governesses would not\r\nstay; all said they were worried out of their lives by the figure of a\r\nlady in blue, which appeared all over the house and on all possible\r\noccasions; and at last the clergyman himself gave in and went away. With\r\nthe next clergyman the same thing happened, and he appealed to the\r\nBishop. The Bishop said he never could tell why he suggested it, but in\r\nhis answer he said, “If the apparition comes again, I should advise you\r\nto throw as much sympathy as you can into your manner, and ask what you\r\ncan do for it.” Soon after he heard from the clergyman that this had\r\nquite succeeded. The blue lady had appeared again, and the clergyman\r\nimmediately, with an appearance of the utmost sympathy in his\r\ncountenance, said, “Madam, is there nothing in the world I can do for\r\nyou?”--upon which a seraphic smile came over the face of the spirit, and\r\nit vanished away and never appeared again.’\r\n\r\n“Lately the Bishop had a letter from an old clergyman at Wisconsin in\r\nAmerica, who wrote to him that an aged parishioner of his had sent for\r\nhim on his deathbed, saying that he could not die happy without\r\nrecounting the facts of a crime which he had witnessed in his boyhood.\r\nHe had been taken by a gang of highwaymen who held their headquarters at\r\nJagherds Court in Wiltshire, and while there was witness to many deeds\r\nof violence committed by them. Amongst others, they carried off a young\r\nlady, and in the row and quarrels which ensued, the young lady was\r\nmurdered at Jagherds Court.\r\n\r\n“The old clergyman, not knowing what to do with this confession, thought\r\nthe best way was to write it to the Bishop of the diocese in which\r\nJagherds was situated, and he wrote it to the Bishop of Gloucester, who\r\nverified the whole, finding his correspondent a veritable clergyman, &c.\r\nThe Bishop of Gloucester told the story last week at Lord Ducie’s.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Dec. 16._--I have been intensely busy. The life of Madame\r\nde Bunsen _unfolds_ itself in her letters more than any life I have ever\r\nheard of. I long for the time to come when I may begin to unite, my\r\nlinks, but at present I have only been making extracts--such extracts!\r\nHer power of expression is astonishing. I discover so much that I fancy\r\nI have felt myself, and never been able to put into words. I see in the\r\nvast piles of MS. the means of building a very perfect memorial to her.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Ampthill, Christmas Day, 1877._--I came here yesterday from\r\nHolmhurst.... It was a great pleasure to find charming old Sir Francis\r\nDoyle here with his son and daughter. Sir Francis talks incessantly and\r\nmost agreeably, and makes the mornings as interesting as the evenings.\r\n‘C’étaient des matinées excellentes, pour lesquelles je me sentirais\r\nencore du gout,’ as Talleyrand used to say. Sir Francis has just been\r\nsaying, apropos of how little one knows the true characters of those one\r\nmeets:--\r\n\r\n“‘H. told me a curious thing one day. He went to dine with a cabinet\r\nminister (I suppress the name), and there came down a lady, the\r\ngoverness, cherished by the family--“a perfect treasure.” He recognised\r\nher at once as a lady he had known very well, very intimately indeed.\r\nShe sank after that, sank into the lowest depth of that class of life.\r\n“I used to help her with money,” he said, “as long as I could, but at\r\nlast she sank too low even for that, quite out of my sphere of\r\npossibilities altogether, and here I found her reinstated. As I was\r\nquestioning what I ought to do, she passed near me and said only, ‘I\r\nhave sown my wild oats.’ I never told of her: I had nothing to do with\r\nplacing her where she was.”’\r\n\r\n“With the same intention Sir Francis told a curious story of ‘Two\r\nShoes,’ a boy at Eton:--\r\n\r\n“‘Two Shoes took a box to a boy-friend of his who was in another house\r\nand said, “A number of curious things are happening in my house, and\r\nthis box contains things of value to me; I wish you would let it stay\r\nhere for a little.” The boy said, “Yes, you may leave your box, provided\r\nonly that it contains no money: I will not be responsible for anything\r\nwith money in it.” Two Shoes said there was no money in the box, and it\r\nwas left. Afterwards, when the box was moved, a great rattle as of\r\nsovereigns was heard inside, and as the tutor of the house whence it had\r\nbeen taken declared himself robbed at the same time, the boy in whose\r\ncharge the box was left thought it necessary to declare what had\r\nhappened. The sixty sovereigns lost by the tutor were found in the box.\r\nTwo Shoes was expelled.... H. went down into ---- shire lately, and there\r\nhe found Two Shoes confidential solicitor to half the county.’\r\n\r\n“Apropos of the secret crimes of so-called ‘religious people,’ Sir\r\nFrancis said--\r\n\r\n“‘I am quite sure that Abigail murdered her husband; that one is quite\r\nleft to understand. He could not have died of the shock of having\r\nescaped David. Oh, no; she was a religious woman, so she waited till six\r\no’clock on the Sabbath evening, and then she poisoned him.’\r\n\r\n“His stories of old times and people are endless. He said--\r\n\r\n“‘I always keep a reminiscence of poor Lady Davy to laugh at. It was one\r\nof those great days at Stafford House, one of their very great gala\r\ndays, and Lady Davy was in the hall in the greatest anxiety about her\r\ncarriage; and she, little woman, walked up to one of those very\r\nmagnificent flunkeys, six feet high at least and in resplendent livery,\r\nand besought him to look after her carriage. I never saw any one _so_\r\ncivil as that man was. “I have called your Ladyship’s carriage three\r\ntimes,” he said, “and it has not answered, but if your Ladyship wishes,\r\nI will try again.”\r\n\r\n“‘I saw the second act of that little drama. I went through the door,\r\nbeyond the awning, just when the footman was stalking haughtily and\r\ncarelessly among the link-boys and saying disdainfully, “Just give old\r\nDavy another call.”’\r\n\r\n“At dinner the conversation turned on Lord and Lady Lytton. She was a\r\nMiss Doyle, a distant cousin of Sir Francis, and shortened his father’s\r\nlife by her vagaries and furies. After his father’s death Sir Francis\r\nleft her alone for many years; then it was represented to him that she\r\nhad no other relations, and that it was his duty to look after her\r\ninterests, and he consented to see her, and, at her request, to ask Sir\r\nE. Bulwer to give her another hundred a year. This Sir Edward said he\r\nwas most willing to do, but that she must first give a written\r\nretractation of some of the horrible accusations she had brought against\r\nhim. When Lady Bulwer heard that this retractation was demanded of her,\r\nshe turned upon Sir Francis with the utmost fury, and abused him with\r\nevery vile epithet she could think of. She afterwards wrote to him, and\r\ndirected to ‘Sir Francis Hastings Doyle, Receiver of her Majesty’s\r\nCustoms (however infamous), Thames Street, London.’ ‘But,’ said Sir\r\nFrancis, ‘I also had my day. I was asked as to her character. I\r\nanswered, “From _your_ point of view I believe her character to be quite\r\nimmaculate, for I consider her to be so perfectly filled with envy,\r\nhatred, malice, and all uncharitableness, as to have no possible room\r\nleft for the exercise of any tenderer passion.”’ Lady Bulwer appeared on\r\nthe hustings against her husband. His son told Sir Edward, ‘Do you know\r\nmy Lady is here?’--‘What, Henry’s wife!’--‘No, _yours_.’ She said, ‘He\r\nought to have gone to the colonies long ago, and at the Queen’s\r\nexpense.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Ampthill, Dec. 26._--This morning Sir Francis was attracted by the\r\nportrait of old Lady Carlisle hanging by the drawing-room door, and he\r\nsaid, ‘That portrait always reminds me of something Lady Carlisle said\r\nonce. I was speaking to her of the death of one of her sisters, and she\r\nsaid, “We were all very sorry, very sorry indeed; but she (pointing to\r\nanother sister), she _cared_.”’\r\n\r\n“For my benefit Sir Francis narrated the story of the thirty-nine\r\nYaconines.\r\n\r\n“In Japan, there was one Daimio who was in rivalry with another, and who\r\nwas superseded by him, and of course his honour could not stand that, so\r\nhe committed ‘the happy despatch.’ His followers ought to have avenged\r\nhim, it was Japanese etiquette that they should, but they did not; they,\r\nlamented and howled, but they did nothing, and the chief of them in his\r\nagony lay down in the gutter and remained there fasting for several\r\ndays. Then one day the head-follower of the successful Daimio, passing\r\nby, saw him in the gutter, and spurned him with his foot and said, ‘You\r\nbeast, you coward, you brute! do you intend to lie there and let your\r\nmaster go unavenged?’ but the man still lay crouched and grovelling and\r\ntook no notice.\r\n\r\n“But a time came when the followers of the successful Daimio were\r\ndispersed, and then the thirty-eight servants of the dead man arose and\r\nwent to him, and kneeling around him said with courtesy, ‘We do not wish\r\nto cut your throat, do not compel us; take the happy despatch;’ but the\r\nDaimio would not take their advice, he could not bring his mind to it;\r\nso then the Yakonines performed their duty, and they cut his throat.\r\nWhen they had done that, the thirty-eight Yakonines summoned all the\r\npeople together to attend them, for they were about to perform their\r\nfinal duty, their ‘happy despatch’ to the manes of their master, and the\r\nthirty-eight performed it, amid the acclamations of the people over\r\ntheir fidelity even to death. But when, afterwards, men came to count\r\nthe corpses, behold there were thirty-nine: the enemy who had spurned\r\nthe Yakonine as he lay in the gutter repented when he saw that he had\r\naccused him falsely, and had silently joined the procession of death:\r\nthere were thirty-nine Yakonines who died.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 27._--Last night a French play was acted, ‘Madame Choufleuri\r\nreçoit chez elle.’ Mr. Lowther, who was merely an old French gentleman\r\nspectator, created for himself a part which was a whole dumb dramatic\r\nperformance in itself.\r\n\r\n“I had a charming drive to-day with Lady Ashburton to Woburn, the rest\r\nhaving preceded us. There is a long winding double avenue in the park.\r\nThe stables are so enormous that we mistook them for the house, and were\r\nsurprised when we turned the other way. However, the door of the real\r\nhouse was most dilapidated and unducal. Long passages, surrounding an\r\nopen court, and filled with portraits, led to a large sitting-room,\r\nwhere we found most of our own party and the guests of the house. The\r\nDuchess was kind and cordial. We all went to luncheon in the Canaletti\r\nroom, enlivened by endless views of Venice, which, regardless of their\r\nartistic merits, are most pleasing to the eye through their delicate\r\ngreen-grey tints. Afterwards we went through the rooms, full of\r\nportraits, one of Lucy Harington in a ruff, very fine. In one corner is\r\na set of interesting Tudor portraits, including a large one of Jane\r\nSeymour; hideous I thought, though Froude, when he saw it, said he did\r\nnot wonder Henry VIII. cut Anne Boleyn’s head off to marry so bewitching\r\na creature. A great portrait of the famous Lord Essex in a white dress\r\nhas a mean feeble face and stubby red beard. The Duke[273] offered to\r\ntake us to the church. Lady Ashburton, Lady Howard of Glossop, and I\r\ndrove there with him. We passed ‘the Abbot’s Oak,’ where the last abbot\r\nwas hung. Froude says he went up to London and was swallowed up by his\r\nfate. The Duke asked what this meant. It did mean that he was hung,\r\ndrawn, and quartered, ‘but Froude was very angry at the question;\r\nhistorians never like being asked for details.’ The banks of a stone\r\nquarry are planted with cedars and evergreens, and the drive to the\r\nchurch is very pretty. The church was built by Clutton, who was turned\r\nloose into a field and told to produce what he could. He _did_ produce a\r\nvery poor mongrel building, neither gothic nor romanesque. The Duke\r\nsaid, ‘Would you like to see what is going to be done with me when I am\r\ndead?’ and he showed us the hole in the floor where he was to be let\r\nthrough ‘to the sound of solemn music,’ and then took us down into the\r\nvaults beneath to see the trestles on which his coffin was to repose! I\r\nlong tried in vain to get Lady Ashburton to leave the endless letters,\r\nsome of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, who stayed with her\r\ngrand-daughter and complained that the house was so dreadfully out of\r\nrepair that the rain came into her bedroom, but another year that was to\r\nbe remedied. We were deep in a ‘Boethius de Consolatione,’ printed in\r\nTavistock Abbey, when the Duchess came in. ‘Would you like to see my\r\ngolden image?’ So we went by a long open cloister, with wooden pillars\r\nrose-entwined, to see where the statue of the Duchess stands on a hill,\r\nall gilt like the figure of the Prince Consort, so that one really could\r\n_see_ nothing except that it was a standing figure, and I could _say_\r\nnothing except that it was very well placed. Then we were taken through\r\nthe sculpture-gallery, in which the great feature is a glorious\r\nsarcophagus, with a relief of the body of Hector being weighed against\r\ngold, Priam and Hecuba standing by with tears upon their cheeks.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 28._--The hours at Ampthill were especially pleasant from five to\r\nseven, when one was allowed to sit with Lady Wensleydale, who, in the\r\nbeautiful halo of her evergreen old age, is all that is most winning and\r\ndelightful--with full memory of her ‘wealthy past’ and gratitude for\r\npresent peace, hemmed in by loving care of children and grandchildren.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Ascot Wood, Dec. 29._--Sir John Lefevre has been talking of an old\r\nacquaintance of his named Balm, who was very extravagant. Some one said\r\nto him once, ‘_Balm, Balm_, if you are not _sage_, you’ll spend a _mint_\r\nin time (_thyme_), and then you’ll _rue_.’\r\n\r\n“He described a dinner-party at which he was present with ten others,\r\nincluding Sydney Smith, who made them all laugh so much that they were\r\nobliged to _stand up_. It was the only time he ever saw it--‘Laughter\r\nholding both its sides.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 6, 1878._--At Ascot Station I met Mark Napier, who resigned his\r\nfirst-class ticket and the companionship of Plato’s ‘Republic,’ his\r\nusual reading in the train, to travel with me. His conversation is\r\nalways full of thought and interest. I went to Cobham in the evening,\r\nand liked my visit, as I always do, meeting many people, including Mrs.\r\nRussell Barrington, who dresses like a figure by Burne Jones, and is\r\neven ambitious of becoming a Botticelli.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Crewe Hall, Jan. 6._--The number of hats in the hall told me on\r\narriving here that there was a large party in the house, but I find no\r\nremarkable elements except Lord Houghton and Mr. Nugee, a clergyman\r\nstill in appearance, but one who has gone out of the Church at the High\r\nend, and has a sort of monastery for training ecclesiastics somewhere in\r\nLondon. He preached to-day in the chapel, standing on the steps of the\r\naltar, a discourse like that of a French preacher, most dramatic, most\r\npowerful, most convincing--yet, oh! how difficult it is to carry away\r\nanything even from the sermons one likes best.\r\n\r\n“Lord Crewe welcomed me very cordially, and made himself so pleasant\r\nthat I thought his eccentricities had been exaggerated, till suddenly,\r\nat dinner, he began a long half-whispered conversation with himself,\r\ntalking, answering, _acting_, and nothing afterwards seemed able to\r\nrouse him back to ordinary life. During the fire which destroyed the\r\ninterior of Crewe some years ago, Lord Crewe bore all with perfect\r\nequanimity, and said not a word till the fire-engines came and were at\r\nwork. Then he turned to his sister, Lady Houghton, who was present, and\r\nsaid, ‘I think I had better send for my goloshes.’[274]\r\n\r\n“It is a very fine house, with noble alabaster chimney-pieces inlaid\r\nwith precious marbles, but since the fire all has been too much overlaid\r\nwith decoration, and in many respects indifferent decoration. The Sir\r\nJoshuas are glorious and numerous.\r\n\r\n“This afternoon Lord Houghton told an interesting story which he heard\r\nfrom Mrs. Robert Gladstone:--\r\n\r\n“‘She went to stay in Scotland with the Maxwells of Glenlee. Arriving\r\nearly in the afternoon, she went to her room to rest. It was a lovely\r\nday. Mrs. Maxwell lay upon the sofa at the foot of her bed. Soon it\r\nseemed to her as if the part of the room opposite to her was filled with\r\nmist. She thought it came from the fireplace, but there was no fire and\r\nno smoke. She looked to see if it came from the window; all without was\r\nbright clear sunshine. She felt herself _frisonner_. Gradually the mist\r\nseemed to assume form, till it became a grey figure watching the clock.\r\nShe could not take her eyes from it, and she was so terrified that she\r\ncould not scream. At length, with terror and cold, her senses seemed\r\ngoing. She became unconscious. When she came to herself the figure was\r\ngone. Her husband came in soon after, and she told him. He took her down\r\nto five-o’clock tea. Then some one said, “You are in the haunted room,”\r\nand she told what had happened. They changed her room, but the next\r\nmorning she went away.\r\n\r\n“Soon afterwards Mrs. Stamford Raffles went to stay at Glenlee. It was\r\nthen winter. She awoke in the night, and by the bright firelight burning\r\nin her room saw the same effect of mist, collecting gradually and\r\nforming a leaning figure looking at the clock. The same intense cold was\r\nexperienced, followed by the same unconsciousness, after a vain\r\nendeavour to awaken her husband, for her limbs seemed paralysed.\r\n\r\n“‘The Maxwells soon afterwards became so annoyed that they gave up\r\nGlenlee.’\r\n\r\n“Lord Houghton also told the story of General Upton:--\r\n\r\n“‘Whilst at Lisbon he saw a military friend of his in England pass\r\nacross the end of the room. On reaching England he went to see his\r\nfriend’s family, found them in deep mourning, and learnt that his\r\nfriend was dead. “Oh, yes,” he said, “I know that; he died on such a\r\nday, for I saw him.” Upon this the family became greatly agitated, and\r\nvehemently denied that he had died till several days later. “_Nothing_\r\nwill convince me,” said General Upton, “but that he died on that\r\nparticular day.” Upon this the widow flung herself on her knees before\r\nhim and implored him for God’s sake not to bring utter ruin upon her by\r\nsaying this to any one else. “Very well,” he said; “I do not want to\r\ninjure you, but the best way will be to tell me the whole truth.” Then\r\nshe confessed. It was one of those cases in which the time for a pension\r\nwas not quite due for a few days, and she concealed the death till those\r\ndays were past.’\r\n\r\n“Lady Egerton, who is here, told of young De Ritchie, whose wife died in\r\nFiji. He obtained leave of absence immediately, and wishing to break the\r\nshock of his wife’s sudden death to her friends, merely telegraphed that\r\nthey were coming home at once, for Ranee was very ill. On the day they\r\nwere expected to arrive, the grandparents said to the little boy left in\r\ntheir charge that they were going to meet his papa and mama, who were\r\ncoming home. The child looked very grave and said, ‘Papa, yes; Mama, no:\r\npoor Mama sleep in Fiji;’ and nothing would make it say any more. Dr. De\r\nRitchie (the grandfather) was so impressed with this, that he was hardly\r\nsurprised when, on going to Southampton, he met his son alone.\r\n\r\n“Sir Watkin Wynne described a curious event on his property. A poor\r\nwoman earnestly implored that a certain tree near her cottage might be\r\ncut down, for she had dreamt that her husband would be killed by it. She\r\nbesought it so earnestly that the tree was ordered to be cut down. In\r\nfalling, the rope attached to the tree caught the poor man, and crushed\r\nhim against the wall, and he was killed.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_London, Jan. 22._--A very pleasant dinner at Lady Ashburton’s. Miss\r\nHosmer[275] was there, very full of her strange discovery of being able\r\nto turn limestone into marble, and then to colour it to any tint she\r\nwishes--a discovery perhaps not unknown to the ancient Romans.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 26._--Dined with old Lady Lyndhurst,[276] who has all the clever\r\nvivacity acquired by her early life in France. Speaking of bullying at\r\npublic schools, she said, ‘I discovered that my Lord had been a bully\r\nwhen he was a boy, and I can assure you I thumped him well at eighty for\r\nwhat he had done at fourteen.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Battle Abbey, March 10, 1878._--I came here yesterday, finding Lady\r\nMarian Alford, and to-day Lord Houghton came. Speaking of Mrs. L. E----\r\n‘s poverty, the Duchess said, ‘It is so sad; really often she has\r\nactually not bread to eat.’--‘Yes,’ said Lord Houghton, ‘but then she\r\nhas so many kind friends who give her _cake_.’\r\n\r\n“Lady Marian described the railway adventure of a friend of hers. Two\r\nladies got into a carriage at King’s Cross, one old and the other young.\r\nInto the same carriage got a gentleman and sat down between them. As\r\nsoon as the train started, he looked round at one and then at the other.\r\nThen he took from his pocket six razors and laid them upon the seat\r\nopposite to him. Then he looked round at each of them again. Then he\r\ntook from his pocket an orange and laid it down in front of the razors.\r\nThen he began to cut up the orange, using one razor for each pig. He\r\nlooked round at each of his victims again. Then he walked across the\r\ncarriage and sat down opposite the old lady, who instantly wound her boa\r\nthree times round her throat. He said, ‘Do you like orange?’ She said,\r\n‘Very much indeed,’ and he took up a pig on the point of one of the\r\nrazors and popped it into her mouth. He then said, ‘Will you have\r\nanother?’ She said, ‘Yes, presently, but wait a few minutes: I like to\r\nhave time to _savourer_ my orange.’--‘How many minutes?’ he demanded.\r\nShe answered, ‘Five.’--‘Very well,’ he said, and he took out his watch\r\nand counted the minutes, and then he took up another pig on the end of\r\nanother razor and popped it into her mouth. Each time she prolonged the\r\nminutes, and the gallant old lady actually kept the madman at bay till\r\nan hour had elapsed and the train stopped at Peterborough, and she and\r\nthe other lady were able to escape.\r\n\r\n“Lord Houghton’s vanity is amusingly natural. Something was said of one\r\nof Theodore Hook’s criticisms. ‘You know even _I_ never said anything as\r\ngood as that,’ said Lord Houghton, and quite seriously. Yet how truly\r\nkind Lord Houghton is, and how amusing, and he does most truly, as\r\nJohnson said of Garth, ‘communicate himself through a very wide set of\r\nacquaintance.’ In his _histoires de société_ he is unrivalled.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 12._--Yesterday Lord Houghton and I sat very long after\r\nbreakfast with the Duke, who talked of his diplomatic life. He was\r\nappointed from St. Petersburg to Paris, and the revolution which\r\nenthroned Louis Philippe occurring just then, he hurried his journey.\r\nWhen he reached Frankfort, Chad, who was minister there, assured him\r\nthat he would not be allowed to enter France, but, provided with a\r\ncourier passport, he pushed on, and crossed the frontier without\r\ndifficulty. At Paris the barricades were still up. The town was in the\r\nhands of the Orleanists (they bore the name then). On the evening of his\r\narrival the Duke was introduced to Lafayette, ‘quite a grand seigneur in\r\nmanner.’ Lafayette asked him if he did not know Lord and Lady Holland,\r\nand on his answering in the affirmative, begged that he would write to\r\nassure Lord Holland that he meant to save the lives of the late\r\nministers, because he was accused of intending to have them executed.\r\n\r\n“The Duke talked much of the wonderful gallantry of the Emperor\r\nNicholas--how when the rebel troops were drawn out opposite his own in\r\nthe square at St. Petersburg, he stalked out fearless between them,\r\nthough the Governor of St. Petersburg was shot dead at his feet. The\r\nrebel troops were only waiting to fire till they saw a rocket, the\r\nsignal from Prince Troubetskoi, whose courage failed him at the last.\r\nTroubetskoi was sent to Siberia, whither his wife insisted upon\r\nfollowing. He was sentenced for life, so was legally dead, and she\r\nmight, had she preferred it, have married any one else.\r\n\r\n“We drove to Normanhurst in the afternoon. Mrs. Brassey showed her\r\nJapanese and Pacific curiosities; the house is full of them, like a\r\nbazaar. We returned through a very lovely bit of Ashburnham.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_April 3._--I came to London on the 19th, and dined that day with Lady\r\nMargaret Beaumont, hearing there of the dear kind old Lord Ravensworth\r\nbeing found dead that day on the floor of the Windsor rooms at\r\nRavensworth, when his daughter Nellie sent for him because he did not\r\ncome in to luncheon.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“On Monday, March 25, as I was breakfasting at the Athenæum, I glanced\r\ninto the paper, and the first thing which met my eyes was the news of\r\nthe total loss of the _Eurydice_, with dear good Marcus Hare and more\r\nthan three hundred men. It was a terrible shock, and seemed to carry\r\naway a whole mass of one’s life in recollections from childhood.... It\r\nis many days ago now, and the dreadful fact has seemed ever since to be\r\nhammering itself into one’s brain with ceaselessly increasing horror.\r\nHow small now seem the failings in Marcus’s unselfish and loving\r\ncharacter, how great the many virtues. It is difficult also to realise\r\nthat there is now scarcely any one left who really cares for the old\r\ntraditions of the Hare family, the old portraits, the old memorials,\r\nwhich were always so much to him, and which I hoped, through him, would\r\nbe handed down to another generation.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_April 14._--On the day on which the _Eurydice_ was lost, Sir J. Cowell\r\nand Sir John McNeill were standing together in a window of Windsor\r\nCastle which overlooks a wide extent of country. Suddenly Sir J. McNeill\r\nseemed to be dreaming and speaking aloud. ‘What a terrible storm,’ he\r\nsaid. ‘Oh, do you see that ship? It will be lost: oh, how horrible! Good\r\nGod, it’s gone!’ It was at that moment that the _Eurydice_ went\r\ndown.[277]\r\n\r\n“I have little to tell of London beyond the ordinary experiences, except\r\nperhaps having been more than ever shocked by the slanderous malignity\r\nof so-called ‘religious people,’ as I have been charmed by the\r\nchivalrous disinterestedness of many who do not aspire to that\r\ndenomination. One often finds Archbishop Whately’s saying too true--‘The\r\nGod of Calvinists is the devil, with God written on their foreheads.’ Of\r\nthe many dinner-parties I have attended, I cannot recollect anything\r\nexcept that some one--I cannot remember who--spoke of D’Israeli as ‘that\r\nold Jew gentleman who is sitting on the top of chaos.’\r\n\r\n“Last Sunday I went to luncheon at Mrs. Cavendish Bentinck’s. I arrived\r\nat two, having been requested to be punctual. No hostess was there, and\r\nthe many guests sat round the room like patients in a dentist’s\r\nanteroom, or, as a young Italian present said, when I made his\r\nacquaintance--‘like lumps of ice.’ Lady Waterford came in and Mr.\r\nBentinck, and we went in to luncheon. There was a table for about\r\nforty, who sat where they liked. Mrs. Bentinck came in when all were\r\nseated, greeting nobody in particular. The lady next me, a perfect\r\nstranger, suddenly said, ‘I want you to tell me what I must do to get\r\ngood. I do not feel good at all, and I want to be better: what must I\r\ndo?’\r\n\r\n“‘That depends on your peculiar form of badness,’ I replied.\r\n\r\n“‘Well, I live where I have a church on each side of me, and a church on\r\nthe top of the hill under which my house is situated. But they do me no\r\ngood. Now I wonder if that is owing to the inefficiency of the churches,\r\nor to the depravity of my own heart?’\r\n\r\n“‘Probably half to one and half to the other,’ I said.\r\n\r\n“I asked afterwards who the lady was, but neither her hostess nor any\r\none else had an idea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Yesterday I dined with the Pole-Carews. Mrs. Carew told me that Dr.\r\nBenson, Bishop of Truro,[278] told her:--\r\n\r\n“‘At my table were two young men, one of them a Mr. Akroyd. He began to\r\ntalk of a place he knew in one of the Midland counties, and how a\r\nparticular adventure always befell him at a certain gate there.\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ said the other young man, ‘your horse always shies and turns\r\ndown a particular lane.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ exclaimed Mr. Akroyd, ‘but how do you know anything about it?’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, because I know the place very well, and the same thing always\r\nhappens to me.’\r\n\r\n“‘And then I come to a gateway,’ said Mr. Akroyd.\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, exactly so,” said the other young man.\r\n\r\n“‘And then on one occasion I drove through it and came to a house.’\r\n\r\n“‘Ah! well, _there_ I do not follow you,’ said the other young man.\r\n\r\n“‘It was very long ago,’ continued Mr. Akroyd, ‘and I was a boy with my\r\nfather. When we drove down that lane it was very late, quite dark, and\r\nwe lost our way. When we reached the gateway, we saw within a great\r\nhouse standing on one side of a courtyard, brilliantly lighted up. There\r\nwas evidently a banquet inside, and through the large windows we saw\r\nfigures moving to and fro, but all were in mediaeval dress: we thought\r\nit was a masquerade.\r\n\r\n“‘We drove up to the house to inquire our way, and the owner came out to\r\nspeak to us. He was in a mediaeval dress. He said he was entertaining\r\nhis friends, and he entreated us, as chance had brought us there that\r\nnight, to come in and partake of his hospitality. We pleaded that we\r\nwere obliged to go on, and that to stay was impossible. He was\r\nexcessively civil, and said that if we must really go on, we must allow\r\nhim to send a footman to guide us back into the right road. My father\r\ngave the footman half-a-crown. When we had gone some distance I said,\r\n“Father, did you see what happened to that half-crown?”--“Yes, my boy, I\r\n_did_,” said my father. It had fallen _through_ the footman’s hand on to\r\nthe snow.’\r\n\r\n“‘The gateway really exists in the lane. There is no house, but there\r\nwas one once, inhabited by very wicked people who were guilty of\r\nhorrible blasphemies--a brother and sister, who danced upon the altar in\r\nthe chapel, &c.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Seaton, Devon, May 7._--I came here on Friday to visit Lady Ashburton,\r\nbut found that erratic hostess gone off to Torquay, so had two days here\r\nalone with Mrs. Drummond’s two pleasant, lively boys. This is an\r\nenchanting little paradise, looking down over the sea from a cliff.\r\nDelightful walks ramble along the edge through miniature groves of\r\ntamarisk and ilex. On one side rises the bluff chalk promontory and high\r\ndown of Bere Head; on the other, one looks across a bay to the cliffs\r\nnear Lyme Regis, and Portland is seen in the blue haze.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 7._--Drove with Lady Ashburton and her daughter to Shute, a\r\nbeautiful old house of the Poles, now a farmhouse, with a gateway like a\r\ncollege gate at the entrance of the park. We sat to draw in the\r\ncourtyard, full of colour and beauty, and afterwards had a delicious tea\r\nin the farmhouse kitchen. In returning, we went to an old ruined house\r\nwhich was the original homestead of the great Courtenay family.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 8._--We were off at 7 A.M. into Somersetshire by train. We got out\r\nat Yeovil, in a lovely country of orchards in full bloom, and drove\r\nfirst to Brympton, the lovely old house of the Ponsonby Fanes. They\r\ninherited it from Lady Georgiana Fane, who is represented in the church,\r\nhaving had her own head added to the body of an ancestress who was\r\nheadless. The place is perfectly delightful--such a broad staircase\r\nwinding endlessly away, and quaint but fresh and airy rooms opening upon\r\na terrace with balustrades and a staircase, and close by the most\r\npicturesque of churches.\r\n\r\n“We went on to Montacute, Mrs. Phelips’s--a most grand old house of\r\nyellow-grey stone, partly of Edward VI.’s time.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nROYAL DUTIES AND INTERESTS\r\n\r\n     “Montre ce qui est en toi!

I always buy them as soon as ever they come out, and I have\r\nso much wished to see you.” She told me that she had been to\r\nHurstmonceaux to visit my mother’s grave, and that she had one of her\r\nstrong presentiments as to the place coming back into our family,\r\nadding, “And I do so hope it will.” She talked of the dear Madame de\r\nBunsen with the greatest affection, and then of the many branches of the\r\nBunsen family. When my little audience of about ten minutes was over,\r\nshe said with great sweetness, “I am afraid I am keeping you much too\r\nlong from all your other friends.” She pressed me to come to stay with\r\nher at Potsdam. I said that I was going to Berlin to visit the Bunsens.\r\nShe said, “Oh, but you must come to _me_; I can show quite as many\r\nthings, and I can certainly show you a great many more people than the\r\nBunsens can.” I said that I feared my visit to Berlin would be during\r\nher approaching absence in Switzerland. She said, “Well, you can go to\r\nthe Bunsens in the summer when I am away, and then in the winter you can\r\ncome again to see me: Berlin is not so very far off.”\r\n\r\nAs spring advanced my Life of the Baroness Bunsen was so far completed\r\nas to be ready for the inspection of her children. I therefore decided\r\nto take it to them in Germany. Feeling how impossible it would be to\r\nmeet all the various wishes and tastes of such a hydra-headed family, I\r\ndetermined only to feel bound by the wishes of the two unmarried\r\ndaughters, Frances and Emilia, and any one of their brothers whom they\r\nmight choose. They selected George.\r\n\r\nI turned first towards the Rhineland to visit the Dowager Princess of\r\nWied, and profit by her recollections of one who had ever been one of\r\nthe most valued of her friends.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of May I reached Cologne, and found there a succession\r\nof telegrams from the Princess of Wied desiring me to come to her. She\r\ndid not exactly say that she expected me to stay beyond the day, so I\r\ndid not like to take my luggage, and was sorry, when I found my room\r\nready and that I was expected for a long visit, that I had sent it on.\r\n\r\nEarly on June 1, I went to Bonn. The place struck me much from its being\r\nso embowered in green and flowers. In a villa thus surrounded I found\r\nthe well-known authoress Fräulein von Weling,[280] whom I surprised in\r\nbargaining for ready-plucked chickens at her door. She is a very\r\ninteresting person, received me with that cordial simplicity which is so\r\ncharming in Germans, and in a minute had put on her bonnet to go with\r\nme to the cemetery by a quiet walk through nursery-gardens. The\r\nchurchyard itself is half hidden in pinks and roses. In the centre\r\nstands an old chapel of extreme beauty, transferred stone for stone by\r\nthe King of Prussia from a solitary position in the fields. Buried in\r\nflowers is the grave where the dear friends of my childhood rest side by\r\nside. Close by is that of their brother-like friend, the noble old\r\nBrandis, his invalid wife, and his son Johannes. Farther off, but still\r\nnear, are the graves of the old Arndt, Niebuhr and his Gretchen,\r\nSchumann, and the widow and son of Schiller. Then we went to Bunsen’s\r\nhouse, with the three-windowed room where he died, the garden with its\r\nview over the Rhine to the Sieben Gebirge, and the pavilion where he\r\ngave his last birthday feast.\r\n\r\nIt is a long ascent of an hour and a half from Neuwied through orchards\r\nand meadows radiant with wild-flowers to Segenhaus, standing on the\r\ncrest of the mountain, which is literally “the House of Blessing” to all\r\naround it. The beautiful spacious rooms, full of books and pictures,\r\nlook down over a steep declivity upon an immense view of the Rhineland.\r\nThe Princess came in immediately with a most warm welcome--a noble,\r\nbeautiful woman in a black dress, something like that one sees in\r\npictures of Spanish Queens-Dowager, with snow-white hair drawn back\r\nunder a long black veil. After a life of love, having lost all those who\r\ngave its greatest charm, she still finds much happiness in making\r\nherself the mother of her people, and the centre of good to the\r\nRhineland from her high forest-home. After a few minutes spent in\r\nexplaining the towns in the vast map-like view below us, she said,\r\n“There is a lady here who is anxious to make your acquaintance, and who\r\nwas delighted to hear that you were coming: it is the Queen of Sweden.”\r\nAt that moment the doors were thrown open, and the Queen entered--of\r\nmiddle age, with a beautiful expression, and possessing, with the utmost\r\nregal dignity, the most perfect simplicity and even cordiality of\r\nmanner. She desired me to sit by the Princess upon a divan facing her.\r\nShe said that I must consider her at once as a friend; that, in a life\r\nof great troubles, the “Memorials” had been her greatest comfort; that\r\nshe never went anywhere without them; that my mother had been for\r\nseveral years the intimate friend to whom she always had recourse, and\r\nin whose written thoughts she could always find something which\r\nanswered to her own feeling and the difficulty of the moment. She asked\r\nafter “Mary Lea,” and how old she was now. She also talked much and\r\nnaturally of my Bunsen work, and entirely entered into all the\r\ndifficulties of meeting the views of so large a family of varying\r\ndispositions.\r\n\r\nThe Princess took me away to see her own room with her family portraits\r\nand photographs. She spoke of her daughter, the Princess of\r\nRoumania,[281] “in her terrible position between Russia and Turkey.”\r\nThen she said, “I want to prepare you for something. At my daughter’s\r\ncourt there is a blind Roumanian noble who has an only daughter. She is\r\ndeaf and dumb. I could not bear that they should never communicate, so I\r\nhave taken her home with me, and I am teaching her to speak by making\r\nher hold her hand _on my throat_ as I speak very slowly; and she is\r\nalready learning, and, though it takes almost all my time, I am already\r\nrewarded by her making sounds which are intelligible to me.” When we\r\nwent back into the other room, the young lady was there, a most strange\r\nbeing, making sounds inarticulate, but intelligible to the Princess.\r\nWhen she saw that the Princess was going to speak, she rushed\r\nacross the room and held her hand on her throat, which had an almost\r\nterrible effect, like garrotting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sophie.\r\n\r\nQueen of Sweden and Norway.]\r\n\r\nAfter tea the Queen ordered her donkey, which was brought round by a\r\nhandsome Swedish chasseur. We went out into the forest. The Queen rode:\r\nthe Princess led the donkey: I walked by the side, and only the chasseur\r\nfollowed. We actually went on thus for three hours, through beautiful\r\nforest glades with exquisite sylvan views, the whole reminding me of\r\ndescriptions in Auerbach’s “Auf der Höhe.” The Queen never ceased\r\ntalking or asking. She wished to know the whole story of my mother’s\r\ntrances at Pau, of Madame de Trafford, of Prince Joseph Bonaparte--“a\r\nsort of cousin of my husband’s.” She talked much and most touchingly of\r\nher own life and its anxieties. “What I feel most,” she said, “is the\r\nimpossibility of ever being alone. I have much happiness, much to be\r\nthankful for, but I feel that what one has really to look forward to\r\nmust come after death, and I do not wish to live.” With her truly “la\r\ngrandeur est un poids qui lasse,” as Massillon said. When alone with her\r\nsister at the Segenhaus in the quiet forest-life, she finds most\r\nhappiness, and they live in a higher world, mentally as well as\r\nphysically. As we went down a steep bank the donkey stumbled, and the\r\nQueen cried out. “Pardon me that I have seemed to be afraid,” she said;\r\n“I have been so very ill, that my nerves are quite shattered;” and in\r\nfact a severe illness, long supposed to be mortal, had at this time\r\nobliged her for several years to leave Sweden in the winter, to be under\r\na great doctor at Heidelberg. She asked me to come to Norway to visit\r\nher. “You must also know my husband,” she said, “and my four sons, my\r\nfour blessings of God.” She repeatedly expressed her wish that I should\r\nbe at Rome in the winter with the Prince Royal. “I am sending him out to\r\nlearn his world.” She asked most warmly after Lea, and sent a message to\r\nher--“I know her so well.” She also desired I would give her tender\r\nsympathy to Hilda Hare,[282] “For can I not feel for her? my second boy\r\nis at sea.” She gave a charming description of her first tour through\r\nNorway to her coronation. “I sat in my carriole by myself, and a peasant\r\nsat upon the little portmanteau behind which held my things, and told me\r\nall about the places and people.” We walked on and on through the vast\r\nwoods, with lovely glimpses of country through the open glades, and\r\nmasses of huge foxgloves where the wood was cut down, and one really\r\nforgot the queen, the almost _tête-à-tête_ of three hours with a queen,\r\nin the noble great-souled woman, whose high ideal of life and all that\r\nit should be seemed for the time to ennoble all the world to one.\r\n\r\nAt the top of a high declivity the Princess unlocked a small gate.\r\nWithin, in a little circular grove of lime-trees, were two marble\r\ncrosses over the grave of the Prince of Wied and his martyr-like son\r\nOtto.[283] “And here,” said the Princess very simply, “is my grave\r\nalso.” The plan of these green mausoleums has been adopted by the\r\npresent family, and two more are planted to be ready for two\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nBehind the palace of the Princess is the great white château of\r\nMonrepos, where her son lives with his wife, who is Princess Royal of\r\nthe Netherlands. Above the lower range of windows is a line of huge\r\nstags’ heads, trophies of the chase of some former prince in the\r\nforest. The House of Wied are “_ehenwürdig_,” and so may always marry\r\nroyalty.\r\n\r\nI said something about never having seen the kitchen-garden of a German\r\nhouse, so when we came home the Princess took me to hers. The Queen then\r\nwalked with us. The Princess prunes and grafts her own roses, &c., but\r\nshe seems to have no perception whatever of any beauty in wild-flowers.\r\nWe went in, and I was shown to a room, whence I came down to that in\r\nwhich the court ladies were assembled. It was rather formidable, but the\r\nCountess Ebba von Rosen, dame du palais of the Queen, talked pleasantly\r\nin English. Doors were thrown open, and the Queen and Princess entered\r\nand we went in to supper. The Queen made me sit by her: the four court\r\nladies sat opposite: the Princess, on the other side of the Queen, made\r\ntea. Thick slices of bread and butter, like those of English\r\nschool-feasts, and mutton-chops were handed round. When we went into the\r\nother room, I wrote down some names of books as desired, and then at\r\n9.30 took leave. The Princess most cordially invited me to return, and\r\nthe Queen again pressed me to visit her in her own country. The vision\r\nof the Queen’s serene noble face as she took leave has ever since\r\nremained with me, and I parted from both the royal sisters with a\r\nstronger feeling of affectionate regard than I have ever felt towards\r\nany one else upon so short an acquaintance.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL _and_ LETTERS _to_ MISS LEYCESTER _and_ MISS WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n“_June 2._--I slept at Neuwied, and then crossing the Rhine in the\r\nmorning mist, passed a few hours at Boppart, where the colouring of the\r\nriver and old houses and the peculiar grey hills was most lovely.\r\nCharles de Bunsen met me at the station of Mosbach, and took me to his\r\nvilla, much like one in Italy, with the same rich intermingled\r\nvegetation of fruit and flowers growing around it.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 4._--Yesterday, a very sultry day, we went to Wiesbaden. The\r\nheavy trees in the gardens looked dripping even more with heat than with\r\nrain, and there is a splendid dulness in the great rooms, formerly the\r\ngambling-house, and in the park beyond, with the many chairs under the\r\ntrees on which people sit to listen to the band; but the fountain is\r\npretty.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. de Bunsen[284] was very amusing in her account of the crowded\r\nmusical festival at Baireuth. When they complained that there were not\r\nenough carriages there, a native replied, ‘Pardon me! of carriages there\r\nare quite enough, but of people there are too many.’\r\n\r\n“In and out, whilst I have been here, has come the next neighbour--‘the\r\nHerr Major.’ He is quite a character, and devotes his whole life to his\r\ngarden. From Holland he--a poor man--ordered some fruit-trees for a very\r\nlarge sum, but they have been a total failure and have borne nothing.\r\nThe other day Charles, driving with him, passed these trees, and knowing\r\nthey were a sore subject, turned his head the other way and pretended\r\nnot to see them. ‘Oh, thank you, dear friend; I appreciate what you are\r\ndoing,’ said the Herr Major, enthusiastically clasping his hand. When\r\nthe boys of Mosbach stole his fruit, he put up an electric wire on the\r\nwall which caused a bell to ring in his bedroom whenever any one got\r\nover it. A few nights ago the bell rang violently; the Herr Major took\r\nhis stick and rushed down the garden in his night-shirt: it was only his\r\nown bulldog, which had jumped over the wall to pay a visit to a friend\r\nin Mosbach. Another time, when his fruit was stolen, the Herr Major\r\nissued a placard offering a reward of a hundred marks to any one who\r\nwould deliver up the thief. The placard was read by two men sitting\r\noutside a beer-house, who were the men who had stolen the fruit. They\r\nimmediately agreed upon their course of action; one man delivered the\r\nother up to justice, and he was sentenced to pay ten marks or to three\r\ndays’ imprisonment; the other claimed the hundred marks, of which they\r\nhad ninety to divide and to spend in drinking for whole days together to\r\nthe health of the Herr Major.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 15._--I have had a charming week at Herrenalb, whither Charles\r\nand Theodore de Bunsen accompanied me. It was a real pleasure to be\r\nagain with the dear Frances and Emilia de Bunsen, who are so like\r\nsisters to me, and the kind pleasant Sternbergs. We were occupied almost\r\nentirely with my book, the sisters taking it in turn to talk over all\r\nthe different parts, but there were also delightful intervals of forest\r\nrambles, and sittings out under the old apple-trees with Emilia.\r\nReinhold von Ungern Sternberg came for the Sunday with Herr von Klüden,\r\nthe ‘_Bräutigam_’ of his sister Dora. The place is just what my sweetest\r\nmother would most have enjoyed for a summer residence--no grand scenery,\r\nbut very high forest-clad hills all round the rich green meadows, with\r\nthe crystal Alb tossing through them. The village of quaint black and\r\nwhite houses clusters round the old-fashioned inn and the water-cure\r\nestablishment in the buildings of the suppressed monastery, of which a\r\nbeautiful ruin of red sandstone--‘The Paradise’--still stands in the\r\nchurchyard. In all directions are well-kept walks and drives, and\r\ncomfortable seats at every picturesque point. The people are most\r\nfriendly and primitive, all the men taking off their hats, and all\r\ngreeting strangers with a friendly ‘Morgen’ or ‘Tag.’\r\n\r\n“A terrible sensation has been created by the attack on the Emperor, and\r\nstill more by the first false report of his death. Men and women were\r\nalike in tears, and the national disgrace is intensely felt. I hope, if\r\nthe Emperor is better, that I may see the Crown Princess again at\r\nBerlin.\r\n\r\n“I spent four hours at Heidelberg, and revisited all our old haunts, the\r\ngardens most lovely in their luxuriance of green. Thence I had intended\r\nto go to Weimar to visit the Grand Duchess, but at Eisenach received a\r\ntelegram from her lady-in-waiting, the Countess Kalkreuth, to put off my\r\nvisit, as they were gone off to Berlin, the Empress Augusta being sister\r\nof the Duke of Weimar. A wet morning at the Wartburg and an afternoon at\r\nErfurth brought me to Jena. There my cousin Alexander Paul met me at the\r\nstation, a pleasant, fat, frank Prussian officer, with a face very like\r\nthat of the first Napoleon.[285]\r\n\r\n“There is much charm in this old town of Jena and its simple population,\r\nincreased by the five hundred students of the university. The houses of\r\nSchiller, Alex. v. Humboldt, &c., have inscriptions in honour of those\r\nwho lived there: the streets wind picturesquely around the old Schloss\r\nand its gardens, and the trumpet still sounds every quarter of an hour\r\nfrom the tall grey tower of the noble old church. From my own window in\r\nAlexander’s house in the Cahl’sche Allée, I see on one side a robber\r\ncastle, on the other a wonderful old church of the time of the ‘Heilige\r\nBonifacius.’\r\n\r\n“On Thursday afternoon we went to Dornberg, where three castles crown\r\nthe cliff above the village with a narrow terrace running in front of\r\nthem along the edge of the precipice. One castle is occasionally\r\ninhabited by the Grand Duke; another, very old and picturesque, was\r\ngiven by Carl August to Goethe, and having been inhabited by him in the\r\nlast years of his life, still contains much furniture of his time: the\r\nthird was the palace of--the Sleeping Beauty in the Wood.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday we went a fatiguing excursion to Schwartzberg, the palace of\r\nthe Prince of Rudolstadt, by which we saw the finest parts of\r\nThuringia. A railway took us to Schwarza, where, in a ball on the top of\r\nthe church steeple, is a dart thrown by a Cossack as the Russian army\r\npassed through Germany. Thence we took an omnibus to the little\r\nChrysopraz Hotel at Blankenberg, where, after beer and brown bread and\r\nbutter under the trees, we walked up the Schwarzthal to Oppelei, where a\r\nSwiss cottage has been built by the Prince to indemnify a forester,\r\nwhose daughter he had made his mistress! Hence, by a steep path, we\r\nascended the Treppstein, whence there is a lovely view over the hollow\r\nin the forest-clad mountains, in the midst of which the great castle of\r\nthe Prince of Rudolstadt rises above the little town. The Prince is not\r\nunpopular, though his life has an Eastern license. On the day when he\r\nsucceeded to his tiny sovereignty he happened to be at Berlin. ‘Bonjour,\r\nsouverain,’ said the Emperor when he met him, and, when he took off his\r\nhat--‘Pray put on your crown.’\r\n\r\n“We dined at the charming little inn, where thousands of wild stags\r\noften assemble under the windows in the evenings, when the place is\r\ncomparatively empty, but take flight into the woods before the summer\r\nguests. In returning, we were much amused with the old ‘Herr Apotheke’\r\nof Rudolstadt, who had come out with a tin case to gather simples, and\r\nwho insisted upon stopping to drink a tankard of beer wherever one was\r\nto be had.\r\n\r\n“To-day we have been in a different direction, by rail to Roda, a\r\ncharming little Thuringian town, and thence by carriage to the Fröhliche\r\nWiederkunft, the old moated castle built by Friedrich Johann, father of\r\nFriedrich der Weise, on the spot where he met his family on his return\r\nfrom a long captivity abroad. The old Princess Therèse of\r\nSaxe-Altenbourg now lives there, she and her sisters--the Queen of\r\nHanover, the Grand Duchess of Oldenbourg, and the Grand Duchess\r\nConstantine of Russia--having been daughters of the old Duke Josef, by\r\nwhom the castle was restored. The news of the King of Hanover’s death\r\nhad just arrived. ‘How many tears,’ said the old man who showed the\r\ncastle, ‘did the old Duke my master shed in that chair over the King’s\r\nmisfortunes.’ The story of the founder is most quaintly told in\r\npaintings on panels round one of the rooms, and there are pictures and\r\nmemorials of Luther and of Friedrich Johann and his wife Sibylla over\r\nand over again.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 23._--A vision of many great towns is all that I carry away from\r\nthe varied journey which has brought me to Hildesheim--the old cities of\r\nWittenberg and Eisleben, with their glorious works of Lucas Cranach and\r\nvaried memorials of Luther and Melancthon: Magdeburg, great and noisy,\r\nwith its dull, restored cathedral: Halberstadt, also restored, but\r\nglorious in spite of its injuries, and with intensely picturesque\r\nstreets of old houses: the romantic beauty of imperial Goslar: stately\r\nQuedlinburg, where German princesses constantly reigned as abbesses:\r\nbeautiful Thale, at the entrance of the Harz, with its exquisite\r\ncombination of wood and rock and water: Brunswick and its many\r\nmarket-places, full of old houses: dull Hanover, with the great deserted\r\ngardens of Herrenhausen.\r\n\r\n“Aunt Marcia (Frau Paul von Benningsen[286]) and my cousins Jane and\r\nClementine met me here at the station.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Berlin, June 27._--My visit at Hildesheim had much of quiet interest.\r\nThe town is wonderfully picturesque, and I was glad to make acquaintance\r\nwith my cousins, who are perfectly _grandes dames_ and highly educated\r\nyoung ladies, though they cook and do almost all the housework\r\nthemselves. I drew in the early mornings, and went to dinner each day\r\nwith them at 12.30.\r\n\r\n“The Hildesheim churches are magnificent, but spoilt, ruined, by\r\nso-called restoration--the old pavements torn up, the old ornaments\r\nremoved and replaced by tawdry and vulgar imitation of Munich\r\nwall-painting.\r\n\r\n“On Monday George de Bunsen met me with his carriage at the Berlin\r\nstation, and brought me through the Thier-Garten, like a bit of wild\r\nforest, to the charming airy Villa Bunsen, standing in its own garden on\r\nthe extreme outskirts of the town. Here I have a most luxurious room,\r\nfilled with royal portraits, and every possible luxury. We dined _al\r\nfresco_ on the broad terrace amid the flowers. On the next evening there\r\nwas a party of about fifty people--tea, and the garden and terrace\r\nlighted up, a very pretty effect; the ladies in bright dresses, the men\r\nwith uniforms and orders, moving and sitting amongst the shrubs and\r\nflowers, amid which endless little supper-tables were laid at a late\r\nhour. Many were the historic names of those to whom I was\r\nintroduced--Falk of the Falk laws, Mommsen the historian, Austin the\r\npoet, Mohl, and many ministers and generals. I found also Arthur\r\nBalfour, and many waifs and strays of old acquaintance. The ‘Congress’\r\nis going on, but excites little or no general interest, and is scarcely\r\nmentioned here, German affairs being far too important.\r\n\r\n“Berlin interests me extremely, though without preparation it can be of\r\nsmall interest. It is almost entirely modern. In the sixteenth century\r\nit must have been a tiny electoral town, the houses encircling the old\r\nSchloss by the Spree in the time of the Great Elector, whose statue, a\r\ngrand though rococo work, stands close by on the bridge. Friedrich I.,\r\nwho got a kingdom by bribery, added the enormous castle, which,\r\nludicrous as it then was in a kingdom of five millions, is now\r\nsatisfactory in a kingdom of twenty millions. Close by, Frederick the\r\nGreat built two domes, merely as features in the distant view of an\r\notherwise featureless city, and to these his son added buildings which\r\nturned them into churches. Under Friedrich Wilhelm III. and IV. the\r\ngreat classical revival took place and endless fine buildings arose. The\r\nlibrary is one of the few buildings which date from Frederick the Great.\r\nThe architects were an endless time disputing over the designs, and at\r\nlast he said, ‘Damn you all, don’t waste any more time; this commode\r\nopposite me is of a very good design, copy that,’ and accordingly the\r\ndesign of the commode was copied.\r\n\r\n“The Museum was begun when the country was poor and had no money to\r\nspend. After the French war, when the country became rich, the design\r\nexpanded and became magnificent. Of the sculptures, four works deserve\r\nespecial attention--the ‘Adorante,’ the exquisite bronze boy who, in the\r\nearly morning, stretches out his arms in adoration: the noble vivid bust\r\nof Julius Caesar in basalt, with agate eyes, so speaking though\r\nvoiceless, so never to be forgotten, of which Rauch had three copies in\r\ndifferent parts of his house that it might never be long absent from his\r\nmind: the bust of Sappho, with banded hair, recognised as the poetess\r\nfrom a Hermes; and the Augustus statue, more noble than that of Livia’s\r\nvilla, because taken in earlier youth, when his one feeling was that he\r\nwas born to command, and when no furrow of disappointment or care was\r\nyet traced on his brow.\r\n\r\n“The collection of casts is most interesting, as showing the important\r\nstatues of each subject, Venus, Minerva, Mercury, &c., side by side for\r\ninstruction or contrast.\r\n\r\n“The pictures are a grand collection, spoilt by over-cleaning.\r\nEspecially worthy of remembrance are an Adoring Madonna by Filippino\r\nLippi, with God the Father above in glory; two noble portraits by\r\nGiorgione; one by Lorenzo Lotto (possibly of Sansovino); some\r\nmarvellously graphic pictures, eloquently expressed in well-considered\r\ntouches, by Franz Hals; and a noble Holbein of ‘Kaufmann Georg Gigge aus\r\nBasel.’\r\n\r\n“Last night we went late to the Zoological Garden. The most interesting\r\nthing was a solemn congregation of ibises listening in a row, each bird\r\nwith one foot in the air, and its head attentively on one side, to an\r\nibis preacher, who never ceased a continuous discourse to them, standing\r\non a stone. The elephant is said to be five hundred years old; what a\r\nsolemn silent witness! Apropos of the future of beasts, George de Bunsen\r\ntalked much of the absence of all allusion to _any_ future in the Old\r\nTestament--that it grew up, partly in the Talmud, partly in the\r\nApocryphal writers, in what Luther beautifully calls ‘the great empty\r\nleaf between the Old and New Testaments.’\r\n\r\n“Montbijou, the curious little one-storied palace of Sophia Charlotte,\r\nwife of Friedrich I., is now a museum for relics of the House of\r\nBrandenbourg. The chairs, sledges, and table of Friedrich I. are very\r\ncurious; the wheel-chairs of his unhappy second wife: the wax figures of\r\nhis grand-daughters as babies; and their portraits as grown\r\nwomen--queens and duchesses. Here also are three masks from the dead\r\nface of the lovely Queen Louisa, that taken immediately after death most\r\nexquisitely beautiful.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 30._--The day after I last wrote, I went with the Bunsens and Mr.\r\nWaddington, the French Minister[287] (come for the Congress of Berlin)\r\nto Charlottenbourg. The palace there is charming--the large gardens, the\r\ngroves of orange-trees in tubs, the great lawns sweeping away into\r\nwoods, and above all the mausoleum in one of the thick groves, with the\r\ntombs of Queen Louisa and her husband. Hither the old Emperor and all\r\nthe royal family come still once a year, on the anniversary of her\r\ndeath, to look upon the beautiful form of his young mother, snatched\r\naway in the very zenith of beauty and popularity, not living to see the\r\nre-establishment of the kingdom in whose cause she sacrificed her life.\r\nExquisitely, perfectly beautiful is the intense repose of her lovely\r\ncountenance, in what I must ever feel to be the most beautiful and\r\nimpressive statue in the world. The statue of the King is very fine too,\r\nbut in her angelic presence he is forgotten. And such was the feeling\r\nfor _her_, that though he did not marry again for many years after he\r\nhad lost her in his youth, his people at first would not believe it, and\r\nthen never forgave it. Mr. Waddington felt nothing in the presence of\r\nthis sublime statue. ‘Yes, it is very clever, it is a very clever figure\r\nindeed,’ he said. Never was any remark more completely out of tune,\r\nmaking it difficult for one to believe in the great power of the man.\r\n\r\n“The next day I went to Potsdam--quite a place by itself in the world,\r\nwith its endless great ultra-German palaces and stiff gardens, arid and\r\ndusty, though surrounded by many waters. Without Carlyle’s ‘Frederick\r\nthe Great,’ they would be mere dead walls enclosing a number of costly\r\nobjects; illuminated by the book, each room, each garden walk, thrills\r\nwith human interest. In the Residenz Schloss are the rooms in which\r\nFrederick the Great passed his winters, with massive silver furniture\r\nand priceless ornaments, amid which the portrait of Wilhelmina in her\r\nchildhood is a touching feature. In the Garrison Kirche is the tomb of\r\nthe great king. The terrace at Sans Souci, in this dried-up land, is\r\nquite lovely with its fountains and orange-trees. Close behind is the\r\nfamous windmill.\r\n\r\n“When I returned to the station, I was surprised to find the Bunsens’\r\nservant, sent on with my evening clothes, that I might accept an\r\ninvitation (by telegram) to dine with the Crown Princess. I had only\r\neight minutes before the royal train came up, and it was an awful\r\nscramble to wash and dress in a room the servant had taken at the\r\nstation. However, when the royal train set off, I was in it. The\r\npalace-station of Wildpark was a pretty sight, red cloth laid down\r\neverywhere, and sixteen royal carriages waiting for the immense\r\nmultitude of guests--quantities of ladies in evening dress (all black\r\nfor the King of Hanover) and veils, splendid-looking officers, an\r\nArmenian archbishop and bishop in quaint black hoods and splendid\r\ndiamond crosses. I went in a carriage with the Greek minister, and we\r\nwhirled away through the green avenues to the great Neue Palais, with\r\nthe sun striking warm on the old red and grey front. Count Eulenborg,\r\nMaster of the Household, stood on the steps to receive us, and we passed\r\ninto an immense hall, like a huge grotto, decorated with shells and\r\nfountains, where several of the court ladies were.\r\n\r\n“At the end of the hall were some folding-doors closely watched by two\r\naides-de-camp, till the rapping of a silver stick was heard from a\r\ndistant pavement, when the doors were flung open, and Count Eulenborg\r\ncame out, preceding the Prince and Princess. She immediately went up to\r\nMrs. Grant (General Grant’s wife) and several other ladies, and then\r\nbegan to go the round of the guests. I had more than my fair share of\r\nher kindly presence. ‘Oh, Mr. Hare, I am so glad to see you again so\r\nsoon. How little I expected it, and how sad the causes which have\r\nbrought it about!’ And she went on to speak of how, at our last meeting,\r\nthe Duchess of Argyll had been sitting with her at tea, and how three\r\ndays after she died. ‘And for me it was only the opening act of a\r\ntragedy,’ she said. She talked of the shock which the news of the attack\r\nupon the Emperor was to her, coming to her in the picture-gallery at\r\nPanshanger, and of her hurried journey to him. The Crown Prince came up\r\nthen, and led her away to dinner. Mrs. Grant was on his other side\r\n(General Grant, a very vulgar officious man, was also there). I had been\r\ndirected to a place near the Archbishop and Bishop of Armenia, but as\r\nthey only spoke Armenian, I was glad that a very handsome, agreeable\r\naide-de-camp eventually took his place between me and them. The dinner\r\nwas excellent, in a huge long marble hall, with windows opening to the\r\nground on the terrace above the flower-garden. Occasionally I met a\r\nbright kindly smile as the Princess looked to see how I was getting on.\r\nThere were about fifty guests, servants waiting noiselessly, not a\r\nfootfall heard.\r\n\r\n“After dinner we all went out on the terraces, and there the Crown\r\nPrincess had the goodness to come again to me. She talked of all I had\r\nseen at Berlin, and of Sweden and Queen Sophie. She talked also of Queen\r\nLouisa, her husband’s grandmother, preferring her statue at Potsdam even\r\nto that at Charlottenburg, and wished to have sent an aide-de-camp with\r\nme to see it. She was so good as to desire that I should return to\r\nPotsdam, and when I showed her that I could not, said, ‘Oh, but you will\r\nnow find your way again to Berlin to see me.’ The scene on the terraces\r\nwas very pretty, looking upon the bright flowers beneath in the subdued\r\nlight of a fine evening in this transparent atmosphere, the whole air\r\nscented with lime-flowers.\r\n\r\n“At a quarter to nine all the carriages came again to take us away:\r\nCount Eulenborg announced them. In the ante-chamber I found the Crown\r\nPrincess again. I kissed her hand, and she shook mine with many kind\r\nwords, and sent affectionate messages to the Queen of Sweden.\r\n\r\n“How we whirled away through the green avenues to Potsdam, where all the\r\npeople turned out to see the cavalcade! I travelled back to Berlin with\r\nthe young and very handsome Prince Friedrich of Hohenzollern (brother of\r\nthe Prince of Roumania and the Comtesse de Flandres), who was saved in\r\nthe annihilation of his regiment of guards in the second battle of Metz\r\nby being sent back with the standard.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 5._--I spent Sunday at beautiful old Lübeck, full of colour and\r\nrich architecture, rising spire upon spire above the limpid river. In\r\nthe streets and market-place are the quaintest towers, turrets,\r\ntourelles, but all end in spires. A great fat constable went about on\r\nSunday morning, keeping everybody from following any avocation whatever\r\nduring church-time: when the services were over, they might do what they\r\nliked.\r\n\r\n“Then came the long weary journey across West Holstein--peat flats\r\nvaried by marshy swamps--and a night at Schleswig, a white, colourless\r\nold town moored as if upon a raft in the marshes, where the Princess of\r\nWales’ grandmother and other royal potentates lie in exposed coffins\r\nupon the floor of the ugly rugged old cathedral, which has a belfry like\r\na dovecot. Everywhere roses grew in the streets on the house-walls. The\r\nchildren were hurrying along, _carrying_ the shoes they were to wear in\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROSENBORG PALACE, COPENHAGEN.][288]\r\n\r\n“Peat and marsh again for many hours, the interminable straight lines of\r\nlandscape only broken by the mounds, probably sepulchral, which are so\r\ncommon here. A straight line with humps at intervals would do for a view\r\nalmost anywhere in Jutland, Fuhnen, or Seeland. After hours upon hours\r\nof this engaging scenery, we crossed the Middelfardt at Fredericia into\r\nFuhnen, which we traversed by rail, and embarked again on the Great Belt\r\nat Nyborg. Then came four hours’ more rail in Seeland, and, at 10.30\r\nP.M., long lines of light glistening on streets of water showed that we\r\nhad reached Copenhagen. Here I met the two daughters of Sir Henry\r\nHolland (Caroline and Gertrude), with whom I had arranged to go on to\r\nNorway, and their niece, Miss Chenda Buxton. As they had already been\r\nwaiting for me several days, I felt obliged to give up a visit to Baron\r\nTroll (the stepson of Madame de Bülow) and the château of Gaüno, but I\r\nhad three full days for Copenhagen, and greatly enjoyed them, the air\r\nbeing that of the high mountains in Switzerland with a mixture of\r\nsea--the most bracing place I ever was in. There is a ‘Dragon Tower,’\r\nwhich is quite ideally Danish; and the old palace of the Danish kings,\r\nRosenborg, surrounded by a moat, is fairy-like in the beauty of its old\r\nage, in the midst of a stately and brilliant old garden, and filled with\r\nhistorical memorials, which carry you back into marvellous depths of\r\nDanish history, in which the Christians and Friedrichs, always\r\nalternating with each other, are most bewildering. The museums also are\r\nfull of interest, especially the Thorwaldsen collection, with casts of\r\nall the works of the great sculptor, and many most grand originals,\r\nespecially interesting to me, as being described in Madame de Bunsen’s\r\nletters from Rome in their first conception and progress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROESKILDE.]\r\n\r\n“One day we went out to Roeskilde, to the great church near a fiord\r\nwhere the kings are buried. Some of the older sovereigns have grand\r\ntombs, but those of later date than the grandfather of our Charles I.\r\nlie in their black and silver coffins unburied upon the floor of the\r\nchurch, with very odd effect.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Stockholm, Grand Hotel Rydberg, July 13._--On the evening of the 5th\r\nwe crossed to Helsingfors in Sweden by a very rough passage of ten\r\nminutes, and had a wild evening walk in the storm, looking upon the\r\nopposite Danish coast, and Helsingborg with the great traditional castle\r\nof Hamlet, whose father was really a pirate-chief in Jutland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASTLE OF ELSINORE.]\r\n\r\n“A journey of twenty-four hours brought us to Stockholm. We only\r\nlingered on the way to see the very fine Cathedral of Lund, the Oxford\r\nof Sweden. The scenery is not beautiful, but pretty--an exaggerated\r\nSurrey, low hills and endless fir-woods, with tiny glistening lakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE JUNCTION OF LAKE MALAR AND THE BALTIC, STOCKHOLM.]\r\n\r\n“Stockholm has deeply interested us, and there is an odd feeling in\r\nbeing at a place and knowing that it is for once and once only in a\r\nlifetime. It is a modern city of ugly streets, but in a situation quite\r\nexquisite, on a number of little rocky islets between Lake Malar and\r\nthe Baltic, surrounding, on the central islet, the huge palace, which is\r\nvery stately and imposing from its size, and the old church of\r\nRiddarholmen, where Gustavus Adolphus and many other kings and queens\r\nare buried under the banner-hung arches. Next to the palace, the\r\nstateliest building is certainly this hotel, where our windows overlook\r\nall that is most characteristic in the place, the bridge which crosses\r\nthe junction of the Baltic and Lake Malar, the mighty palace dominating\r\nthe central island, the great white seagulls poised upon the blue\r\nwaters, and the steam-gondolas, filled with people, darting to and from\r\none island to another. These are the chief means of communication, and\r\nwe make great use of them, the passages costing twelve öere, or one\r\npenny.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIDDARHOLMEN.]\r\n\r\n“We shall not go to see the midnight sun at Hammerfest; it would be very\r\nfatiguing, and indeed there can be little to see which we have not here;\r\nfor we have only about two hours’ night in Stockholm, and by 2 A.M. it\r\nis light enough to read the smallest print. This has a very odd effect\r\nat first, but one soon gets used to it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHURCH OF OLD UPSALA.]\r\n\r\n“Alas! we have been here a week, and, except one day, it has rained\r\nalmost incessantly. One pities the poor Swedes in losing their short\r\nsummer, for there are only about three months without snow, and every\r\nday is precious. The streets are sopping, but we have managed several\r\nexcursions in the covered gondolas to quiet damp old palaces on the\r\nbanks of lonely fiords. On our one fine day we went to Upsala by rail,\r\nand saw the cathedral where Gustavus Wasa lies aloft on a great tomb\r\nbetween his two pretty little wives, and we drove on to Old Upsala,\r\nwhere Odin, Thor, and Freya reigned as human beings and were buried as\r\ngods. In the tomb of Thor--a grassy mound--the Government still gives\r\nthe mead of ancient times to foreign visitors. It is a very delightful\r\nplace, like a dip in the Sussex downs, the quaint church, of immemorial\r\nantiquity, probably once a pagan temple, nestling behind the mounds of\r\nthe heroes.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday we heard a hundred Upsala students, the best singers in the\r\nworld, sing the best national music in the Caterina Church. The King was\r\nthere, a noble royal figure. He is _the_ sovereign of the age, artist,\r\npoet, equally at home in all modern languages and several ancient ones,\r\nprofoundly versed in all his duties and nobly performing them. The Crown\r\nPrince was with him, a fine young fellow, spoilt in appearance by his\r\nmother’s Nassau mouth, and the Prince Imperial, who is here with his\r\ncousins on a visit. The Queen is still away. I had many introductions\r\nhere, but as the Court is at the country palace of Drottningholm, have\r\nnot thought it worth while to present them; generally, however, Swedes\r\nare quite charming, especially in their manner to strangers.\r\n\r\n“Cheating or imposition in hotels or elsewhere is utterly unknown; the\r\nonly fear is lest you should not be charged enough. We asked what we\r\nshould do with our luggage if we went to Dalecarlia--‘Oh, you can leave\r\nit anywhere under a bush, no one would touch a thing,’ and I am sure\r\nthat it is so.\r\n\r\n“The Hollands are delightful companions, full of interest in everything,\r\nglad to draw, reading up all the history, learning Swedish, holding\r\nhistorical and retrospective examinations once a week. We do a great\r\ndeal of ‘lessons’ together. Certainly that one’s travels should ‘leave a\r\ngood taste’ behind entirely depends upon one’s companions. And we are\r\nnever even reduced to the state which I find alluded to in a French\r\nguide-book--‘Dans une voiture découverte, quand il y a une personne de\r\nmauvaise humeur, les autres admirent le paysage.’ Mr. and Mrs. Eric\r\nMagnusson are in this hotel, and we see a good deal of them. He is an\r\nIcelander, but now a Professor at Cambridge, and sent here by the\r\nUniversity to investigate and inspect the Runic inscriptions.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRIPSHOLM.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 15._--Yesterday we steamed down Lake Malar to Gripsholm, a very\r\nquaint castle with domed red towers, full of ancient pictures, and with\r\nthe wonderful old room and bed where Queen Catherine Jagellonica\r\n(delightful name!), whose tomb we saw at Upsala, gave birth to her son\r\nSigismund, afterwards King of Poland.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Throndtjem, July 28._--Surely this old cradle of Northern Christianity\r\nis one of the most beautiful places in the world. No one had ever told\r\nus about it, and we came here only because it was the Throndtjem of\r\nsagas and ballads, and expecting a wonderful and beautiful cathedral;\r\nbut it is really a dream of loveliness, so exquisite in the soft silvery\r\nmorning lights on the fiords and purple mountain ranges, and the nearer\r\nhills covered with bilberries and breaking into steep cliffs, that one\r\nremains in a state of transport, which is at a climax when all is\r\nengraven upon an opal sunset sky, and when ships and buildings meet\r\ntheir double in the still transparent water. Each old wide street of\r\ncurious wooden houses displays a new vista of sea, of rocky\r\npromontories, of woods dipping into the water, and at the end of the\r\nchief street is the grey massive cathedral of St. Olaf, where Northern\r\nart and poetry have exhausted their loveliest and most poetic fancies\r\naround the grave of the national hero. Here alone in Scandinavia I have\r\ngone back perpetually to the old days of my life, and felt how happy the\r\nmother would have been here, so much--almost everything--being within\r\nher own walk; and I seem to see our trio spending a quiet month at this\r\nhomelike hotel (where the landlord and landlady--highly educated people\r\nof good family--receive their guests like friends in a country-house),\r\nand sallying forth to draw in all the sheltered coves and wooded rocks\r\nby the side of fiord or river. The air too is most bracing, an arctic\r\nfeeling combined with the brightest sunshine.\r\n\r\n“My companions and I get on perfectly, and I am filled with admiration\r\nof Miss Holland’s strong, decided nature, and her perfect knowledge of\r\nall she wishes and intends, combined with great good-nature. Both\r\nsisters take boundless interest in all they see, and the journeys seem\r\nshortened by alternate lessons in history, Norsk, &c., and games of\r\ndifferent kinds, even charades, one side of the carriage acting against\r\nthe other!\r\n\r\n“But I must go back to Kristiania, which was steaming in intensity of\r\nheat when we reached it, the wet of Stockholm having cleared in Norway\r\ninto cloudless sunshine which had hatched all the mosquitoes. There is\r\nno beauty in the mean little town, which was built by Christian IV.\r\n(brother of our Anne of Denmark), and has a good central church of his\r\ntime. We went by rail to Kongsberg, a primitive place with a nice little\r\nhotel kept by a Dane, where, however (and at many other places), we were\r\nannoyed by the ludicrously consequential advent of General Grant and Co.\r\nHere we hired a carriage and carriole for a five days’ excursion in\r\nTellemarken. What a drive!--by silent lakes or through deep, beautiful,\r\never-varying woods of noble pine-trees, rising from thickets of juniper,\r\nbilberries, and cranberries. The loveliest mountain flowers grow in\r\nthese woods--huge larkspurs of rank luxuriant foliage and flowers of\r\nfaint dead blue, pinks, stagmoss--wreathing around the grey rocks, and\r\ndelicate lovely soldanellas drooping in the still recesses. But what a\r\nroad, or rather what a want of one!--hills of glassy rock, up which our\r\nhorses scrambled like cats, abysses where they gathered up their legs\r\nand flung themselves down headlong with the carriages on the top of\r\nthem, till at the bottom we were all buried in dust, and picked\r\nourselves up, gasping and gulping, and wondering we were alive, to begin\r\nthe same pantomime over again.\r\n\r\n“Our midday halt was at Bolkesjö, where the forest opens to green lawns,\r\nhill-set, with a charming view down their smooth declivities upon a\r\nmany-bayed lake with mountain distances. Here, in a group of old brown\r\nfarm-buildings, covered with rude picturesque painting and sculpture, is\r\na farmhouse inhabited by its primitive owners through many generations.\r\nThe little rooms and their furniture are painted and carved with mottoes\r\nand texts, and portraits with autographs of royal visitors hang on the\r\nwalls. The entrance to the cellar was under the bed. ‘Ajö, ajö,’\r\nexclaimed Miss Buxton, in our newly acquired Norsk, as the old landlady\r\ndescended into it to get us some ale.\r\n\r\n“We arrived at the little châlet of Tinoset on the wrong day for the\r\nsteamer down its lake, and had to engage a private boat. The little lake\r\nwas lashed by the wind into furious purple billows, and the voyage was\r\nmost wretched. A horrid male creature from Middlesborough, whom we\r\nsurnamed the ‘Bumble Bee,’ accompanied us. I was brutal enough to make\r\nhim over to Miss Holland, by saying, ‘This lady will be deeply\r\ninterested to hear all you have to say,’ and to her he buzzed on\r\nperpetually. He told us that the people of Middlesborough were\r\nastonished--and no wonder--at his building in the midst of that hideous\r\nred manufacturing place a black and white timber house in imitation of\r\none at Coventry, and designing to be carved on its barge-board the\r\ncharming inscription--\r\n\r\n    ‘Ye beastes who passe admire ye goode\r\n     Which thys manne didde whereer he coulde.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOLKESJÖ.]\r\n\r\n“From our landing-place at Strand we had several hours’ drive along an\r\nunprotected precipice to the Rjukan-foss, the 560 feet high fall of a\r\nmountain torrent into a black rift in the hills. It is a boiling,\r\nroaring abyss of waters, with drifts of spray which are visible for\r\nmiles before the fall can be seen itself, but the whole is scarcely\r\nworth the trouble of getting there, though a little mountain inn, with a\r\nwell-earned dinner of trout and ale, and a quiet hour amongst the great\r\ngrey larkspurs, furnish pleasant recollections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHURCH OF HITTERDAL.]\r\n\r\n“As we returned to Kongsberg, we stopped to see Hitterdal, the\r\ndate-forgotten old wooden church so familiar from picture-books. Here we\r\nwere told by our landlady that she would not give us any dinner--‘Nei,\r\nnei, nothing would induce her; perhaps the woman at the house with the\r\nflag would give us some.’ So, hungry and faint, Miss Holland and I\r\nsallied out as _avant-couriers_ to the house with the flag. All was\r\nsilent and deserted except for a dog, who received us furiously. Having\r\npacified him, and finding the front door locked, we made good our\r\nentrance at the back, examined the kitchen, pried into all the\r\ncupboards, lifted the lids of all the saucepans, and not till we had\r\nsearched everything for food ineffectually, were met by the lady of the\r\nhouse, a pleasant young lady, speaking English perfectly, who informed\r\nus, with no small surprise at our conduct, that we had been committing a\r\nraid upon her private residence. Afterwards we found a lonely farmhouse,\r\nwhere also there had once been a flag, where they gave us a very good\r\ndinner. Two young girls, whom we had first met at the Rjukan-foss, dined\r\nwith us, and made us acquainted with their parents. The father, an old\r\nman who smoked an enormously long pipe, turned out to be the Bishop of\r\nChristiansand.\r\n\r\n“On the 25th we started from Kristiania for Throndtjem, the whole\r\njourney of three hundred and sixty miles very comfortable and only\r\ncosting thirty francs. There is no great beauty in the scenery, but\r\npleasant variety--rail to Eidswold, with bilberries and strawberries in\r\nbirch baskets for sale at the railway-stations: a vibrating steamer on\r\nthe long dull Miosen lake: railway again, with some of the carriages\r\nopen at the sides: a night at Koppang, a large station, where several\r\npeople, strangers to each other, are expected to share the same room. On\r\nthe second day the scenery improves; the railway sometimes runs along,\r\nsometimes over the river, till the gorge of mountains opens beyond\r\nStoren into a rich open country, with turfy mounds which reminded us of\r\nthe graves of the hero-gods of Upsala, till, beyond the deep cleft in\r\nwhich the river Nid runs between lines of old painted wooden warehouses,\r\nrises the burial-place of St. Olaf, the centre of Northern Christianity,\r\nthe shrine of Northern faith, the stumpy-towered cathedral of\r\nThrondtjem.\r\n\r\n“The most northern railway station and the most northern cathedral in\r\nEurope.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THRONDTJEM FIORD.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 8._--To the last the unspeakable beauty of Throndtjem grew upon\r\nus. It is not at first sight of its wide streets of low timber houses,\r\nor even of its fiord with purple mountain background, or of its glorious\r\ncathedral in the wide-spreading churchyard, which is the town-garden as\r\nwell as the centre of all its sympathies, that you learn to admire it,\r\nbut after many sunsets have turned the fiord into rippling gold, and\r\nsent an amethystine glow over the mountains, and after many rambles\r\nalong the shores to rocky points and bosky hillocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THRONDTJEM CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S. OLAF’S WELL.]\r\n\r\n“After much indecision, we determined to return from Throndtjem by road,\r\nand engaged two carriages at Storen, with a pleasant boy named Johann as\r\na driver. At every ‘station’ we changed horses, which were sent back by\r\na boy who perched on the luggage behind, and we marked our distances by\r\ncalling our single carriole horses after the kings of England. Thus,\r\nsetting off from Storen with William the Conqueror, we drove into the\r\nRomsdal with Edward VI., but (after a drive with Lady Jane Grey) setting\r\noff again with Bloody Mary, our kings of England failed us long before\r\nour driving was over, and we used up the kings of Rome also. It was a\r\nvery wild interesting life, and there was a great charm in going on and\r\non into the unknown, meeting no one, dining on trout and pancakes at a\r\nstation at midday, sleeping in odd, primitive, but always clean rooms,\r\nand setting off again at 5.30 or 6 A.M. There are bears and wolves in\r\nthe forest, but we never saw any. Their skins, shot during the winter,\r\nare hanging up in almost all our sleeping-places. The prices are\r\nextraordinarily low, and the homely, cordial people kissed our hands\r\nall round on receiving the smallest gratuity, twopence halfpenny being\r\na source of ecstatic bliss. But the journeys were tremendous, as we were\r\nsometimes called at four, and did not get in till twelve at night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE ROMSDAL.]\r\n\r\nThere was for a long time nothing especially fine in the scenery, except\r\none gorge of old weird pine-trees in a rift of purple mountain, and the\r\nhigh moorland above Jerkinn, where the great ranges of white Sneehatten\r\nrise above the yellow grey of the Dovre Fyeld, hoary with reindeer moss.\r\nFrom Dombaas, we turned aside down the Romsdal, which soon became\r\nbeautiful, as the road wound above a chrysopraz river, broken by many\r\nrocky islets, and swirling into many waterfalls, but always equally\r\nradiant, equally transparent, till its colour is washed out by the\r\nmelting snows in a ghastly narrow valley which we called the ‘Valley of\r\nDeath.’\r\n\r\n“The little inn at Aak is very delightful, with a large garden on the\r\nhillside, and the views indescribably glorious--of the tremendous peaks\r\nof pink granite, or fields of pathless snow embossed against a sky\r\ndelicately blue above, but melting into clearest opal.... There was much\r\nin the place, as at Throndtjem, which recalled my former life, and I\r\nseemed to go back into a lost past, to read a page long pasted down and\r\nput away. In both places _we_ should have stayed for weeks; in both, I\r\ncould see our trio sallying out every morning with campstools and books,\r\nmaking friends with the natives, or in the quiet of home life, with its\r\nhome occupations in the little inn.\r\n\r\n“And now, after many more stations, we have passed through Lilliehammer,\r\nand are again on the Miosen lake, speeding through the closing days of\r\nour tour.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Orkeröd near Moss, on the Kristiania Fiord, August 9._--On reaching\r\nKristiania last night, I found a most gracious telegram from the Queen,\r\nthrough Countess Rosen, desiring that I would spend my last days in\r\nNorway with her. So I came this morning by the early steamer. Most\r\nbeautiful were the long changing reaches of the fiord, with the rocks\r\ncovered with foliage, already waving towards autumn, the rich russet and\r\ngolden tints of the trees repeating themselves in the water. At Moss (to\r\nthe intense astonishment of a very vulgar American family on board, who\r\nhad given themselves indescribable airs to me) a royal carriage with two\r\nchasseurs in cocked hats and plumes was in waiting, and the King’s\r\nchamberlain was standing on the pier to receive me. We drove swiftly up\r\na rocky forest road to the large villa which a merchant of Kristiania\r\nhas lent to the Queen for the benefit to her health from the pine air.\r\nAnother merchant close by has lent his to the King, as the immense\r\npersonnel of the court could not possibly live in one house. As we drove\r\nup through the garden, a tall figure in a wide-awake hat emerged from\r\none of the windows upon the terrace. ‘Sa Majesté le Roi!’ said the\r\nchamberlain; so I jumped out of the carriage, and he came forward at\r\nonce with ‘Is it Mr. Hare? The Queen has spoken of you so much, that you\r\nare not like a stranger. The Queen will be delighted to see you, and so\r\nam I. We were so glad to hear that you would come to see us in our quiet\r\ncountry life. You will find nearly the whole family, only my second son,\r\nOscar, has left us to-day. I am especially glad that you will see the\r\nPrince Royal, my eldest son, Gustaf. You will have a very little room\r\nwith us, for we are so full, but you will have a good bed, and that is\r\nthe essential. Come now and take a walk with me in the garden.’ So we\r\nwalked and he talked, chiefly about Rome. Then he took me to the Prince\r\nRoyal, who was sitting under the trees with the Countess Rosen, two\r\nmaids of honour, and Baron Holtermann, the marshal of the palace. There\r\nwe sat some time and talked till the Queen emerged from the house. I\r\nwent towards her, and met her amongst the flower-beds. She looks\r\nwonderfully well, far better than at Segenhaus. Nothing could be more\r\ncordial or kind than her reception of me. We walked on the terrace for\r\nsome time, and she talked of the great event since we parted, the attack\r\non the Emperor, and of the Crown Princess.\r\n\r\n“Then we went to sit under the trees and we talked of Throndtjem. The\r\nQueen described her first journey thither to her coronation. The King\r\nhad been making a tour round by the North Cape, and she went to meet\r\nhim. She went in a succession of carrioles by Lilliehammer and then by\r\nthe Romsdal. At all the little stations people met her with flowers.\r\n‘Art thou the mother of the land?’ they said, ‘art thou the mother of\r\nthe land? Thou lookest nice, but thou must do more than _look_ nice;\r\nthat is not the essential.’ She said that even at Throndtjem the\r\npeasants touchingly and familiarly always called her ‘Du.’ ‘Art thou the\r\nmother of these tall boys?’ they said, and they would pray aloud that\r\nshe might be blessed--in her husband, in her children, and in her home.\r\nOne old woman asked the Countess Rosen to beg the Queen to go upon the\r\nroof of the house--‘then we shall all see her.’ The Queen also described\r\nher last journey back from Segenhaus. Her two horses, her dog, and her\r\ndonkey travelled with her.\r\n\r\n“Soon the beautiful donkey of our Segenhaus walk was brought round, with\r\nits crimson trappings, and the Queen mounted, and went off through the\r\nforest to the King’s house. I went in a kind of large open car with the\r\nCountess Rosen, the maids of honour, and the chamberlain. We reached the\r\nKing’s villa before the Queen, and all drew up in two lines in the porch\r\nto receive her. There were also a great number of the people of Moss to\r\nsee her arrive, as it is known she always does so at this hour. The King\r\ngave his arm to the Queen, and we all went to luncheon in a garden\r\npavilion. Here the two youngest Princes came in,--Carl, a very handsome\r\nboy of seventeen, and Eugène, of twelve. The King called me to come up\r\nto a tiny round table at the end of the room on a daïs, where he and the\r\nQueen were alone, and made me sit with them on their divan. He said, ‘I\r\nshall now leave out your Mr. and only call you Hare, and upon that we\r\nwill all drink healths;’ and he made me clink my glass with his and the\r\nQueen’s. The King talked much of the Prince Royal and his education, of\r\nall the languages he thought he ought to learn, and (perfectly without\r\nostentation) of his own very great facility for\r\nlearning--‘catching’--languages, and of the great advantage it had been\r\nto him through life. I had had no food since six o’clock in the morning\r\nand was almost fainting with hunger, so, in spite of the honour of\r\nsitting with the King and Queen, I greatly envied the court at their\r\ngood luncheon below, as their Majesties (and consequently I) had only\r\ncoffee cups for their soup, and a tiny slice of bread and cheese apiece.\r\n\r\n“Then the Queen mounted her donkey again, the King lifting her up, while\r\nthe young Princes, climbing the pillars of the verandah behind their\r\nmother, made a pleasant family group. The cap of the Queen’s chasseur\r\nfell off, and the King picked it up for him and playfully pushed it\r\ntight down upon his head. Then the King and Princes started to walk, and\r\nI for a long drive with the Countess Rosen and some of the court. And\r\nnow I am resting and the Queen has sent me a number of English\r\nnewspapers to read. A propos of the picture of Lord Beaconsfield\r\nreceiving the Garter in the _Illustrated_, the King said, ‘Now, let us\r\ntalk a little politics. I like and admire most things English, but I\r\nwill not conceal from you that I do not admire Lord Beaconsfield. I did\r\nnot think his conduct about Cyprus was quite straightforward.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 10._--At four o’clock yesterday the whole court met in the\r\ndrawing-room, so many gentlemen turning up from hidden corners, that it\r\nmade twenty-four persons in all. The Prince Imperial recognised me\r\nimmediately when he came in, and was exceedingly cordial and friendly. I\r\nwas really glad to see him again. He is as nice as he can be, but as to\r\nappearance, his photographs flatter him, as he has such a bad complexion\r\nand his legs are too short. He is, however, quite delightfully frank and\r\nwinning. He kissed the Queen’s hand very prettily and gracefully as she\r\ncame in, looking very well with large bunches of natural double geranium\r\nupon the white lace of her dress and in her hair. He took the Queen, the\r\nKing took Countess Rosen, and we all followed to dinner. I was desired\r\nto sit by the Prince Royal. His peculiar features are redeemed by a good\r\nexpression when animated. He talks no English and atrocious French, and\r\nwas difficult to get on with at first. Prince Carl, the third son, is\r\nvery handsome, and seems to have a charming disposition. After dinner\r\nthe princes were to go out fishing, and the head fisherman sent to say\r\nthat there would be no room for little Prince Eugène, as there were so\r\nmany of the Prince Imperial’s suite to be taken. Prince Carl came to the\r\nQueen and begged that Eugène might not be told, he would be so\r\ndisappointed, and that he might stay at home in his place; and the Queen\r\nsaid, ‘Charles is always like that; he never can be persuaded to think\r\nof himself.’ I tried to talk of Rome to the Prince Royal, but whenever a\r\nmaid of honour on the other side claimed his attention, was glad to\r\nsubside into conversation with an old chamberlain. The King drank\r\nhealths at dinner, the Prince Imperial’s, mine, Count Murat’s. The\r\nPrince Royal asked me to clink glasses with him. ‘Do you like that\r\ncustom?’ he said. A Swedish noble, appointed to wait on the Prince\r\nImperial, stood up when the King drank his health. Then I saw the other\r\nside of the King--in very cold stern rebuke. ‘In good society gentlemen\r\ndo not stand up when their healths are drunk,’ and that in the severest\r\ntones. The Queen looked surprised, and a momentary chill fell upon the\r\nwhole party. I am sure that the Swede, who was a very bumptious young\r\nman, had done or said something before which had displeased the King.\r\n\r\n“When the princes were gone to their fishing, the Queen made me come and\r\nsit by her. She returned at once to the subject of the Prince Royal and\r\nher great anxiety that I should be much with him abroad. ‘He must\r\n_learn_ his world,’ she said, ‘he knows so little of it. He is\r\nthoroughly good, but what he wants is enthusiasm, he wants to be incited\r\nto knowledge, to learning his future out of the past, and oh! you can\r\nhelp him so much, and if you will, I shall always be so grateful to you:\r\nbut remember, and I know it will always help you to be kind to my boy\r\nif you do remember, what my boy’s future must in all probability be. Oh,\r\nMr. Hare, do when there is a chance, sow some little seeds of good in my\r\nson’s young heart, and remember that what you do is not only done for\r\nthe Prince Royal, not even for his mother, who entirely trusts you, but\r\nfor the thousands upon thousands of people whom he may one day be called\r\nupon to influence. Whatever happens, if you will only interest yourself\r\nfor my boy, you will believe in his mother’s gratitude.’\r\n\r\n“The Queen continued to talk long in this manner with the utmost\r\nanimation, till the Countess Rosen, suddenly seeing some sign of illness\r\nunobserved by us, ran round and said, ‘Dear Majesty, you must not now\r\nspeak any more,’ and led her away with a charming mixture of motherly\r\naffection and playful deference.\r\n\r\n“When Countess Rosen returned, she said, ‘The King desired that as soon\r\nas the Queen had ceased speaking to you, you should go to him: he\r\nespecially wishes to talk to you alone.’ I found the King under a tree\r\nin the garden, reading a book (the ‘Odes of Horace,’ I think), and,\r\nfearing to disturb him, I pretended to occupy myself with the flowers,\r\nbut he perceived me at once, closed the book, and coming to me, took my\r\narm, and walked up and down on the terrace. ‘The Queen has been speaking\r\nto you of our son,’ he said; ‘I know what the Queen has been saying, and\r\nI wish to continue her conversation. He is a good boy, but he has not\r\nbeen tried; he has no idea what the world is like, nor of the many\r\ntemptations which lie in wait for a young man, above all for a prince.\r\nNow the Queen and I are quite agreed that it is our wish that you\r\nshould be as much to our son as possible, and I wished to see you alone\r\nthat you might believe that all that his mother wishes, his father\r\nwishes also.’ The King then talked in detail of the Prince’s probable\r\nlife in Rome, of the places and people he must see. ‘Please understand\r\nat once that my son must go to the Quirinal,’ he said. He went on to\r\ntalk more earnestly of England, of the difficulties of all the lines to\r\nbe drawn, and of all the individual persons whom it might be well for\r\nthe Prince to see, and also some to be avoided. He wished the Prince to\r\nhave a quiet month in England, to accustom himself to language and\r\npeople, before going to London: he thought of Torquay; I suggested St.\r\nLeonards. He talked of Lady Waterford, whom he remembered many years\r\nago, and admired almost more than any woman living, and wished that she\r\nmight be persuaded to give an invitation to his son.\r\n\r\n“Speaking of the course of study which would be best for the Prince led\r\nthe King to talk of the great pleasure a thorough knowledge of Latin had\r\nbeen to himself, both for its own sake and as making all other languages\r\neasy to him.\r\n\r\n“The King talked much of the anxieties at Berlin, and of the cloud over\r\nthe royal life there. ‘Oh, how thankful I ought to be, how thankful I\r\ncontinually _am_, for our quiet corner, for a reign which is one of\r\nlove. I never felt this more than in the Queen’s lonely carriole journey\r\nto her coronation at Throndtjem, and it was renewed lately in our son’s\r\njourney to Tellemarken. And though our people care for us, they do not\r\nflatter us. When the Queen was in the little village churches, near the\r\ndifferent small stations where she passed her Sundays, the simple\r\nvillage curates of those mountain districts did not hesitate to preach\r\nto their Queen of all that she ought to do, of all that her life ought\r\nto be for herself and others, and oh! we are so grateful to them.’\r\n\r\n“While we were talking, the court ladies were playing at croquet on the\r\nlawn. The King afterwards joined them, and I took a short walk with\r\nBaron Holtermann, marshal of the palace, and then went in and sat down\r\nto read in the drawing-room. Presently the King put in his head from the\r\nQueen’s room--‘Yes, he is here,’ he said, and then he called me to come\r\nin to the Queen. They then both of them took my hands and spoke to me in\r\na most touching manner about the Prince Royal. The Queen also spoke of\r\nthe uncertainty of her life, and of renewed meetings in distant Norway,\r\nand of her hope of seeing me in another world. She gave me her portrait.\r\nI could not but feel it a very solemn moment and very affecting. They\r\ntook me out on the balcony of the room for one quiet moment. ‘Remember\r\n_how_ we trust you,’ they said. And we looked down upon the fountain\r\nplaying and the burnt grass and brilliant flowers in the moonlight and\r\nthen we went back to the public rooms.\r\n\r\n“The Prince Imperial and the Swedish princes now returned from fishing,\r\nsinging at the pitch of their voices through the woods, and we all went\r\nupstairs to supper. Their Majesties and the whole court had--Swedish\r\nfashion--each a great bowl of sour milk, with a great hunch of bread and\r\ntwo preserved peaches in a glass. The Prince Royal, by whom I again\r\nsat, fortunately asked for sweet milk, so I was able to do so also. Then\r\nthe King and princes went to the other house, and I took a sad farewell\r\nof the beloved Queen. If ever there was a woman who united the truest,\r\nwidest spirit of Christianity with every earthly grace, it is Queen\r\nSophie of Nassau.\r\n\r\n“The Queen’s dresser was turned out of a room for me--a good room, but\r\nwith neither soap nor bath, no chance or understanding of hot water, and\r\nthe looking-glass quite unavailable! Swedes are accustomed to none of\r\nthese things as necessaries in houses where they visit.\r\n\r\n“At 8 A.M. Baron Holtermann fetched me to walk through the woods to the\r\nKing’s house to breakfast, after which I walked with the King to the\r\npier at the end of the garden. There the younger princes kissed their\r\nfather, and the Prince Imperial (who was going away at the same time and\r\nwhom the King would accompany to Kristiania) took leave of the court. It\r\nwas an intensely hot day, the town of Moss and the shore of the fiord\r\nseeming to steam with hot mist and the flowers all drooping. A little\r\nsteam-pinnace took us all to the luxurious steamer, where there was\r\nboundless space for sitting or walking or whatever we liked. The voyage\r\nwas very long--five hours. I sat reading ‘Ticknor’s Memoirs,’ and the\r\nKing and Prince Imperial came occasionally to talk to me. I found in the\r\nbook an account of the Prince’s grandmother, Comtesse de Téba, in her\r\nprime, which interested the King very much. He said, ‘The Prince\r\nImperial keeps me in a perpetual state of mental tension: he does ask\r\nme _such_ questions. I am always wondering what he will say next. He is\r\nalmost _too_ intelligent a young man. He has just asked me to tell him\r\nhow long a steamer takes to get up steam. I have seen hundreds of\r\nsteamers getting up steam, but I never thought before how long it took.\r\nHowever, I have had to think now, and it takes five quarters of an hour.\r\nOh, the Prince Imperial is very good mental exercise.’\r\n\r\n“Half-way down the fiord, the Prince Imperial insisted upon it that he\r\nmust bathe. At first the King said it was impossible, that the moment of\r\nhis arrival at Kristiania was fixed, that the people were waiting to see\r\nhim, that the steamer could not be delayed--in fact, that it was out of\r\nthe question. But while the King was discoursing, the Prince Imperial\r\nstripped off every article of clothing he had on, and after rushing up\r\nand down the deck perfectly naked, jumped into the sea over the poop and\r\nswam like a fish. The King then was obliged to stop the steamer, as he\r\ncould not leave the Prince Imperial in the middle of the fiord, and he\r\ntold an aide-de-camp to undress and go to pick out the Prince. The\r\nPrince lay on the breast of the waves laughing at the King till the\r\naide-de-camp reached him, and then he dived, disappeared for some time,\r\nand came up on the other side of the vessel. The Prince Royal then\r\nundressed and went in too, and two aides-de-camp, and they all swam and\r\npursued each other like mermen. When at last the Prince was persuaded to\r\nre-embark, he sang and shouted in most uproarious spirits. Then came\r\nluncheon. The King proposed the Prince’s health--‘Mon cher hôte et mon\r\ncher neveu’--and then he proposed mine, saying, ‘I drink to your\r\nmeeting with the Prince Royal at Rome, and you _will_ be kind to my\r\nboy?’\r\n\r\n“We entered Kristiania in triumph--all the towers, houses, and masts of\r\nthe vessels in the harbour decorated with flags, cannon firing, and\r\ncrowds of people on the quays. At the station were crowds too, waiting\r\nfor the royal carriages as they drove up. There was quite a procession\r\nof them. I went in the second carriage with Count Murat. At the station\r\nI had just time to present the Miss Hollands, then I took leave of the\r\nking.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 17._--The Prince Imperial travelled with us from Kristiania. It\r\nwas an ovation to him the whole way--crowds at all the stations, and\r\nshouts of ‘Hoch, Hoch!’ instead of ‘Hurrah.’\r\n\r\n“We parted company with the Prince at Helsingor, whence we went to\r\nFredensborg, a dull château and pretty garden, and then to\r\nFrederiksborg, really magnificent, one of Christian IV.’s grandest\r\nbuildings, on three islands in a lake.\r\n\r\n“We have since seen Bremen with the grand calm face of the gigantic\r\nRoland-Säule raised above the busy market, and Münster with its old\r\ncathedral and Congress-hall, and now we are at Tournai, where there is a\r\nnoble cathedral, contrasting in its serious thoughtfulness of design\r\nwith the frippery and sameness of Cologne. And to-day, being in the\r\noctave of St. Roch, Tournai is hung with flags for a really beautiful\r\nprocession--crosses, banners, images, reliquaries carried aloft by\r\ntroops of young girls in white and blue and little boys in mediaeval\r\ndresses. Some of the tiny children in golden oak-chaplets, and with\r\ngreat golden oak-bouquets or golden lilies, are quite beautiful.\r\n\r\n“And to-day, too, we pass out of the peculiar existence of the last two\r\nmonths into ordinary working life again. Great is the thankfulness I\r\nfeel for all, especially for my kind and pleasant companions.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI spent the late summer of 1878 very quietly at home, busied in\r\ncompleting the Life of the Baroness Bunsen. Many guests came and went,\r\namongst them Miss Wright, whose constant kindness and affection had been\r\nso much to me for many years. Whilst with me she was very ailing, but it\r\nwas only supposed to be rheumatism, and doctors, who examined her\r\ncarelessly, sent her from Holmhurst to Buxton, which was fatal to her,\r\nfor her real disorder was heart-complaint. I never shall forget the\r\nbitter anguish of the shock, gently and tenderly broken as it was by\r\nMary Lefevre, when I read that I should never see again the loving\r\ndevoted friend of so many years, who alone was always ready to help me\r\nin any difficulty, always glad to fight a battle for me, and whose\r\nhumble nature so terribly overrated me, making me, however, long to\r\nstruggle up in reality to that higher shelf on which I saw she had\r\nmentally placed me. Hers was one of--\r\n\r\n    “The many lives, made beautiful and sweet\r\n     By self-devotion and by self-restraint,\r\n     Whose pleasure is to run without complaint\r\n     On unknown errands of the Paraclete.”[289]\r\n\r\nWonderfully, though simply and unconsciously, did she fulfil the ideal\r\nof a holy life which is given us in the 15th Psalm. But it was not till\r\nshe was gone, till her outpouring of gentle tenderness was silenced for\r\never, that one realised all she had been, and that her loss left a void\r\nfor life which could never be filled up. Constantly have I gone back\r\nwith useless self-reproach--would that I had done more to make her\r\nhappy! would that I had always been more grateful in reciprocating so\r\nmuch kindness!--and most constantly have I been reminded--\r\n\r\n    “How each small fretting fretfulness\r\n     Was but love’s over-anxiousness,\r\n     Which had not been had love been less.”\r\n\r\nYears have passed away as I write, but I can scarcely bear to speak of\r\nher, even to write of her, even now. “How holy are the holy dead! How\r\nwillingly we take _all_ the blame to ourselves which in life we were so\r\nwilling to divide.”[290] “Nevermore” is one’s echo of regret, but “too\r\nlate” is that of repentance.\r\n\r\nDear Lady Williamson passed away from us in the same autumn, deeply\r\nloved too, but in her blindness and deafness one felt that her life--her\r\nentirely noble and beautiful life--was lived out, which one could not\r\nfeel dear “Aunt Sophy’s” to be. She seemed to die, her life unfulfilled.\r\n\r\nThroughout the autumn I had heard frequently from the Queen of Sweden\r\nand Norway, through the medium of her principal lady in waiting, the\r\nCountess Ebba von Rosen. The entire confidence and noble friendship\r\nexpressed in these letters made it impossible for me to hesitate, when,\r\nafter the Prince Royal had spent some time in Paris, it became the\r\nstrong wish of her Majesty that I should join him at Rome. It was in\r\nentire concert with the King and Queen that I drew up the scheme of a\r\nseries of peripatetic lectures for the Prince, in which, by describing\r\nhistoric events on the places with which they were connected, I hoped to\r\nfix those events and their lessons in his recollection. Their Majesties\r\nalso agreed to the plan of my inviting others to join the excursions of\r\nthe Prince. It was, however, with great misgiving that I left England,\r\nfeeling that I gave up my pleasant home and congenial occupations in\r\nEngland for the constant companionship of a young man who had not, in\r\nour short previous acquaintance, made a very favourable impression upon\r\nme, and who might--should he take that line--resent my exertions in his\r\nbehalf, and look upon me rather as a spy for his parents than as a\r\nfriend to himself. When I once reached Rome, however, these fears were\r\nsoon set at rest, and during the whole nine months which I passed in\r\nconstant intimacy with the Prince, I never once had to reproach him with\r\nwant of consideration for myself personally, but, on the contrary,\r\nalways received from him marks of the utmost esteem and affection.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of November 16 I left Holmhurst, having worked at the\r\nindex of my Bunsen Memoirs till within ten minutes of my departure. Upon\r\nthe passage of the Mont Cenis I came in for terrible snowdrifts.\r\nSuddenly, after passing the tunnel, the walls of snow increased on each\r\nside of the train so as almost to block out the light, and, with a dull\r\nthud, the train came to a standstill near the wretched village of Oulx.\r\nAn avalanche had fallen upon the luggage train which was pioneering our\r\nway, and three poor men were engulfed in it. The cold was terrific, and\r\nthe suffering was increased in my case, because, having usually been\r\nmuch tried by the overheating of foreign trains, I had brought no\r\ncarriage-rug or other wraps with me. After some time a way was cut\r\nthrough the snow walls to a miserable tavern, where sixteen ladies\r\ndecided to sleep or cower in one wretched room and twelve gentlemen in\r\nanother, but I gladly made my way back to the carriage before the\r\npassage was blocked again. It was then two in the afternoon, and wearily\r\nthe day wore on into night, and still more wearily passed the night\r\nhours, with snow always falling thickly. I had a little brandy in the\r\ncarriage, but no food. The suffering from cold was anguish. There were\r\nseveral invalid ladies in the train, for whom I felt greatly, knowing\r\nwhat this catastrophe would have been in times past before I was alone.\r\nBefore morning two more avalanches had fallen behind us and the return\r\nto France was cut off. The telegraph wires were all broken, and the\r\nguard assured us that it was possible we might be detained days, or even\r\nweeks. At midday, cold and hunger made me try the hovel once more, but\r\nthe filth and smells again drove me back to the carriage. At 4 P.M.,\r\nhowever, on the second day, a welcome shouting announced that our\r\ndeliverance was at hand. No trains arriving at Turin, our position was\r\nsuspected, and the town-firemen were sent out _en masse_ to cut a way\r\nfor us. At 6 P.M. we were released from our twenty-eight hours’\r\nimprisonment, but the way was so dangerous, that we did not reach Turin\r\ntill long after midnight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_26 Piazza di Spagna; Rome, Nov. 25, 1878._--You will imagine how\r\ntouching--I shall never grow used to it--was the slow approach by rail\r\nround the walls of Rome, crossing all the little lanes _we_ knew so well\r\nin our drives, and seeing, one after another, S. Paolo, the Caius\r\nCestius, the Porta S. Sebastiano, S. Giovanni in Olio, Porta Maggiore,\r\nthe Minerva Medica, and then the vast space once occupied by the\r\nbeautiful Villa Negroni, but now parcelled out for straight streets and\r\nstuccoed houses.\r\n\r\n“Yet, considering it is four years since I was here last, the changes\r\nare not great yet: the same old man with peaked hat and long beard and\r\nthe same pretty girls stand waiting as models: the same old stonecutter\r\nis grinding away under the Tempietto, and Francesco threw open Miss\r\nGarden’s door and announced (simply) ‘Il Signorino,’ as if I had been\r\nthere the day before.\r\n\r\n“On Sunday, Umberto and Margherita of Savoy made a triumphal entry into\r\nRome, and I went to the Palazzo della Consulta to see them arrive at the\r\nQuirinal. It was an exquisitely beautiful evening--not a breath of air\r\nstirring the many flags: the obelisk and statues and the grand fountain\r\nof Pius VII. were in deep shadow, but the sun was glinting through the\r\nold ilexes in the Colonna Gardens and illuminated S. Peter’s and the\r\ntown in the hollow. There was an immense crowd of every class, from\r\nex-guardia nobile to peasants in the costumes of Sora and Aquino, and\r\nthrough them all the vast procession of sixty carriages moved to the\r\npalace, with flags flying, and flowers falling, and cannon thundering,\r\nand the one little bell of the royal chapel tinkling away as hard as it\r\ncould, because the other churches would make no sign. ‘I Sovrani,’ as\r\nall the people called them, looked very proud and happy, and Queen\r\nMargherita marvellously graceful, and pleased to see the millions of\r\nmarguerites, which people were wearing in honour of her. The little\r\nPrincipe de Napoli is quite hideous, but they say well brought up under\r\nan English governess, and King Umberto in every way seems to wish to\r\nreform his dissolute father’s court, as well as to screen his memory,\r\nhaving taken the whole of his enormous debts upon himself, besides\r\npaying off Victor Emmanuel’s eight ‘domestic establishments’ out of his\r\nprivate purse. The King and Queen came out upon the balcony of the\r\nQuirinal, and were triumphantly received. (Next after the royal\r\ncarriages had come a fourgon with the bouquets presented at the\r\nstation.) Last night there was a torchlight procession, tens of\r\nthousands bearing torches, with music, banners, and gigantic\r\nmarguerites, who passed through the Piazza di Spagna on their way to the\r\nQuirinal. _Still_, taxes are rather increasing them otherwise; the\r\nmisery of the formerly prosperous Romans is extreme, and many think a\r\nrevolution imminent.\r\n\r\n“Monsignor Prosperi is dead. I wonder if you remember about that most\r\nextraordinary person, who was supposed to have the evil eye. The Romans\r\nbelieve that all the many misfortunes of this year, and the attacks on\r\nroyalty, &c., are because it fell to his turn to _cantare la missa_ at\r\nS. Maria Maggiore on the first day of the year. No end of shipwrecks and\r\nrailway accidents are attributed to him, and so the poor man’s death is\r\na subject of general rejoicing. It is recollected that after the last\r\nvisit he ever paid, the servant of the house fell down on the stairs,\r\nand cut his eye open with the Monsignore’s visiting-card which he held\r\nin his hand.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn arriving in Rome, I had found a tolerable little apartment for myself\r\nin 29 Piazza di Spagna, and the Prince Royal established in the charming\r\nsunny first floor of the Palazzo Rocca-Giovine in the Forum of Trajan.\r\nThither I used daily, often twice a day, to go to the Prince. From the\r\nfirst he welcomed me very cordially, and I could see that he was really\r\nglad of my coming, still I was uncertain whether there would ever be\r\nmore than an interchange of courtesy and duty between us. I never hoped\r\nto be able to give him the real affection I afterwards so sincerely\r\nfelt. Somewhat to my consternation, I was desired by the King to fix my\r\nfirst lecture for the Prince for one of the very first days after my\r\narrival, in order that Baron Holtermann, marshal of the palace, who was\r\nreturning to Stockholm, might take back a full account of “how it went”\r\nto their Majesties. The Queen added her special request that I would say\r\nnothing except in English, in order to force the Prince-Royal to learn\r\nthat language.\r\n\r\nAs being the central feature and axis of ancient Rome, I chose the\r\nCapitoline for my first lecture. General and Mrs. Stuart and Lady Agnes\r\nDouglas met me there at the top of the steps, and waited for the Prince,\r\nwho arrived on foot with Baron Holtermann and two other Swedish\r\ngentlemen. I doubt at first whether they understood a word I said in\r\nEnglish, and the being obliged constantly to translate into French or\r\nbad German did not add to the liveliness of the lecture. Our procession\r\npassed from point to point in the most funereal manner. The Prince made\r\nno observation whatever, Romulus, the Tarpeian Rock, Marcus Aurelius\r\npassing equally unnoticed; only when we came to Palazzo Caffarelli he\r\nsaid, “Oh, that was where Mim Bunsen was born:” it had touched a\r\nchord of human interest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gustaf, Crown Prince of\r\n\r\nSweden-Norway.]\r\n\r\nI wonder what sort of account of this lecture Baron Holtermann can have\r\ntaken to the Swedish court; but we did better next time, when, on the\r\nPalatine, the Prince’s spirits quite rose over all the murders of the\r\nemperors and empresses. In the latter part of the winter, the lectures,\r\nwhich took place three times a week, were quite an enjoyment, he was so\r\nmerry, so kind and pleasant to every one, so glad to know everything.\r\n\r\nVery soon, after consultation with M. de Printzsköld, the Queen’s\r\nchamberlain, who had accompanied the Prince to Rome, I proposed going\r\ntwice a week to read English with the Prince in the late afternoon,\r\nwhich was gladly accepted, and on those occasions we read “Mademoiselle\r\nMori” alternately, and translated “Tolla” into English. It was in the\r\nlittle conversations which inevitably interspersed themselves with these\r\nreadings that I first learnt to know my Prince really well. The readings\r\nthemselves he found it very difficult to attend to, and the exercises he\r\nprepared for me were much against the grain, so we did not make much\r\nprogress till I obtained an order from the Queen that the equerries\r\nshould do the same exercises as the Prince, which roused his ambition,\r\nand he went ahead at once, and always did much better than his\r\ncompanions. I think it is Adam Smith who says that “the great secret of\r\neducation is to direct vanity to proper objects.” After our lessons, I\r\nalways dined with the Prince, sitting on his right hand. Afterwards the\r\nPrince and his Swedish gentlemen smoked, and as soon as it was possible\r\nto do it, I took my leave, except on evenings when I went out into the\r\nworld with the Prince. But for the most part the Prince’s evenings were\r\nspent at home, the Italian court showing him no attention, and scarcely\r\nany of the Roman princes inviting him, except during the Carnival. Old\r\nLady Morton was throughout exceedingly kind and helpful where the Prince\r\nwas concerned, and gave several parties for him. At these, the Prince’s\r\ndistant cousins, Princess Gabrielli, Countess Primoli, and Countess\r\nCampello, the round fat elderly daughters of Lucien Bonaparte, were\r\nalways present.[291] They were pleasant sensible women, especially\r\nCountess Primoli (Princess Charlotte Bonaparte). Having all married\r\nbeneath their rank, they always made a point of going in and out of a\r\nroom in the order of their age, which had often a funny effect.\r\n\r\nOf all the people who welcomed me back to Rome, the most cordial were\r\nthe blind Duke and the Duchess of Sermoneta, whom I was delighted to\r\nfind established for the winter in the upper floor of the old Caëtani\r\nPalace. Since her marriage, the Duchess had contrived to conciliate the\r\nwhole Caëtani family, not only to herself, but to each other. She had\r\nalso ransacked the unknown corners of the palace, and had found endless\r\nold hangings, old portraits, &c., things almost valueless in themselves,\r\nbut which gave the bare walls a look of historic antiquity. I often took\r\nthe Prince to the evening receptions of the Duchess, at which, as at all\r\nthe princely Roman houses, some tea and very sour lemonade were\r\nconsidered quite sufficient as refreshments. Without the Prince, I often\r\ndined with the Sermonetas at their homely early excellent Italian\r\ndinner, and an oasis in commonplace life was meeting there the Abbot\r\nMarcaldi of La Cava, the Abbot Pescitelli of Farfa, and a most beautiful\r\nold Don Pietro Tailetti, canon of St. Peter’s--like a mediaeval picture.\r\nThey had all wished to see me, from their pleasure in the chapter on the\r\nBenedictine rule in “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MARY LEA GIDMAN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORNETO.][292]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATHEDRAL OF CORNETO.][293]\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 11, 1878._--I always see the Prince now with increased\r\nsatisfaction and an increasing certainty that he likes having me with\r\nhim. I also feel that I _am_ able to be to him all that the Queen of\r\nSweden wished, of which at first I was uncertain. In our walks he asks\r\nso many questions about what he sees, that I have to work hard in the\r\nevenings before to prepare myself to answer properly, for I find that I\r\nhave forgotten much of the detail of my Roman history, &c.... Last week\r\nwe went for the whole day to Corneto, eating an excellent breakfast\r\nprovided by the Prince’s cook in the train. Professor Helbig, who had\r\npreceded us, met us at the station with a little omnibus. With this we\r\nwent up into the high hills above old Tarquinii, and then descended with\r\ntorches into the great sepulchres, where the dead of two thousand years\r\nago are seen (in terra-cotta figures as large as life) sitting round at\r\nimaginary banquets, while the walls are covered with paintings of their\r\ndeeds in life--hunting, fishing, dancing, &c., as fresh in colour as\r\nwhen they were painted. Then we went to visit a Countess Bruschi, who\r\nhad a great collection of jewels and other beautiful things found in the\r\ntombs. This lady was the only person to whom we revealed who the Prince\r\nRoyal was; but whilst we were at dinner the secret transpired, for there\r\ncame from the Bruschi palace a bouquet of the most magnificent roses,\r\nlike a sheaf, carried by two footmen, and another bouquet of camellias,\r\narranged in a huge citron; and then the governor of the town arrived to\r\nmake a little speech, to which the Prince gave a suitable answer, which\r\nI had to translate into Italian; and then all the people found out, and\r\ncame to look at the Prince.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day I received a telegram from the Queen of Sweden\r\nexpressing her good wishes, and thanks for the kindness shown to her\r\nson. From a letter received about the same time from Countess Rosen I\r\nextract:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Stockholm, Dec. 18, 1878._--H.M. the Queen charges me to convey to you\r\nher thanks for your letters, which are very welcome. The Queen says you\r\nmanage to tell just what interests her most about the doings of the\r\nCrown Prince. Both the Queen and the King thank you heartily for all\r\nyour kind interest in the Crown Prince, and they perceive already that\r\nyou have succeeded in gaining a good and useful influence over him, and\r\nthat you have kindled up his interest for all that now surrounds him.\r\nThe Queen is charmed if you write often, but she is afraid that it takes\r\nup too much of your time, which is much taxed already through all that\r\nyou do for the Prince....\r\n\r\n“The Queen begs you to write with perfect frankness, even when\r\neverything is not quite as one would wish it to be. Be sure that what\r\nyou say will never be misunderstood.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 5, 1878._--I think my last letter may have expressed some of the\r\ndepression I certainly felt as to the uncertainty of my position with\r\nthe Prince Royal, and I know with how much pleasure you will hear that\r\nthese clouds have completely cleared away. I have increasing, indeed I\r\nhave now _perfect_ satisfaction in my position with the Prince, and in\r\nthe internal conviction that I can and may be to him all that the Queen\r\nhas wished. The great secret is, I suppose, that I am becoming really\r\nvery fond of him. He not only daily unfolds new gifts and graces for\r\nevery one, but he is hourly pleasanter and more charming in all his\r\nrelations to me, and I have now the certainty that I am most welcome to\r\nhim; but indeed he has always treated me with entire confidence, though\r\nyou will easily understand that had he possessed the slightest shadow of\r\nsmall-mindedness, he must have looked upon me with a sort of suspicion,\r\nfrom the intimacy with which his parents have honoured me, and my\r\nconstant letters--which he knows _must_ be about himself--to the Queen.\r\n\r\n“To-day my lecture for him was on the Aventine. At S. Sabina I sent in\r\nnotice of their visitor to the Abbot and the Father-General of the\r\nDominicans, and in his honour the two ladies of our party, Countess\r\nBarnekow and Lady Agnes Douglas, were allowed to penetrate the inmost\r\nrecesses of the convent, and to visit the cell of S. Dominic, with his\r\nexquisitely beautiful picture, and the cell of S. Pius V. As we came out\r\nof the church, the Abbot presented the Prince with a large basket of\r\noranges and apples, and some leaves from the sacred tree of S. Dominic,\r\nand the Father-General with photographs of the convent pictures and\r\nview. Afterwards we visited the lovely Priorato garden, still full of\r\nflowers, and S. Prisca, and the wild, beautiful Vigna dei Gesuiti.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was one of the wise and kind thoughts of the Queen at this time to\r\nmake it appear to the Prince that an eagerly coveted permission to go to\r\nBucharest and Athens upon leaving Rome was granted in consequence of my\r\npetition in his favour. And indeed it was granted--as a Christmas\r\ngift--in consequence of my letters to the Queen as to the progress he\r\nwas making, &c. I often wonder whether my letters to the court of Sweden\r\nof this winter have been preserved: I wrote such volumes, often\r\nillustrating them with sketches, &c.--“Memoires _pour servir_ pour la\r\nvie du Prince Royal.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 19, 1878._--Ere this you will probably have received Madame de\r\nBunsen’s Life ‘from the author.’ There is much in it which will interest\r\nyou, some things you will not like. So it is with everything and\r\neverybody. But I am quite satisfied that it is the most truthful\r\nportrait _I_ could have painted, and I trust it may worthily commemorate\r\nmy dear old friend.\r\n\r\n“The news of Princess Alice’s death, announced in a sermon on Sunday,\r\nwas quite a shock, as I had not heard of her being ill; and she was so\r\nkind to me when here, and so interested and amused in correcting ‘Walks\r\nin Rome.’\r\n\r\n“My dear Prince is very well and happy and enjoying everything. I see\r\nhim daily, generally for half each day, but have very little new to say\r\nabout it. I have found a passage about Charles I., by Cowley I think,\r\nwhich expresses just what I hope may be said of him some day: ‘Never was\r\nthere a more gracious Prince or a more proper gentleman. In every\r\npleasure he was temperate, in conversation mild and grave, in friendship\r\nconstant, to his servants liberal, to his Queen faithful and loving, in\r\nbattle brave, in sorrow and captivity resolved, in death most Christian\r\nand forgiving.’\r\n\r\n“The Queen writes through the Countess Rosen that she is delighted that\r\nI am going with the Prince to Florence, and that it was quite the\r\nPrince’s own idea; but she fears I shall find him rather a dull\r\ncompanion there, as he has very little taste for picture-galleries.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 6, 1879._--I was very glad to part with 1878--a year of many\r\nsorrows--dear Miss Wright’s death the greatest. On the last evening I\r\nwent to Mrs. Terry’s, where Miss Trollope sang exquisitely ‘Should auld\r\nacquaintance be forgot’ in the last minutes of the year.\r\n\r\n“My last lecture for the Prince was upon the last days of S. Paul, going\r\nto the pyramid of Caius Cestius, the last surviving witness of his life,\r\nto the desolate Tre Fontane, and then to the huge basilica which sprung\r\nfrom his martyrdom. At the Tre Fontane the Prince found a beautiful\r\npiece of old marble railing and a fine fragment of pietra-dura pavement,\r\nused to wall in a flower-bed; bought them, and he and I lugged them back\r\nto the carriage between us. He is now very happy, and (though there\r\n_are_ black days) enjoys everything very much. We have increased our\r\nlittle party by the handsome widowed ‘Anne, Countess of Dunraven,’ and\r\nthe charming Countess Schulenberg, a North Prussian.\r\n\r\n“The Prince and I dined with Lady Morton the other day, meeting Prince\r\nand Princess Altieri, Prince and Princess Sulmona, Countess Apponyi, &c.\r\nI was very glad that he should meet this completely ‘black’ party, as he\r\nhas had few opportunities of meeting that phase of politics. On Thursday\r\nthe Duchess Sermoneta gives another party for him, to which she has\r\ntaken the fancy to ask all the ‘learned’ people in Rome. My poor Prince\r\nwill not make much of them, but will be amused with many, especially\r\nwith Donna Ursilia Lovatelli, who likes to converse in Sanscrit, and who\r\nhad to be told that she must not bring with her more aides-de-camp than\r\nthe Prince (four); as her ‘court,’ as she calls it, which likes to\r\nfollow her, sometimes numbers sixty persons. Madame Minghetti will also\r\nbring _her_ court, which is far more Bohemian, amusing, and agreeable.\r\n\r\n“But daily I feel more the force of something which I think was said by\r\nCharles V. of France: ‘On doit nourrir les princes des vertus, afin\r\nqu’ils surmontent en mœurs ceux qu’ils doivent surmonter en\r\nhonneurs.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 29._--I am glad to hear of my book, which I have not seen, though\r\nit reached Stockholm long ago. It is a pleasure to have an outburst of\r\napproval from the Bunsens. Of reviews I think little, knowing how they\r\nscarcely ever have anything to do with the merits or demerits of a work,\r\nbut only with the wish of an editor to advantage or injure an author:\r\nbesides, the newspapers all copy one another, only changing the words.\r\n\r\n“We have had burning sun and intense scirocco here, which of course\r\nmeans a great deal of rain, and there have been torrents each day, but\r\nlovely effects between, such masses of cloud rolling over St. Peter’s,\r\nwith brilliant light falling through upon the many-domed town, and\r\ntremendous conflagrations at sunset. I spent Christmas Eve at the\r\nPalazzo Colonna, where the Duchess Marino had an immense Christmas-tree\r\nfor her servants and friends, and a merry party of children. A prettier\r\nsight than the tree was the little Duchess herself, in a white silk\r\ndress, with a long lace veil looped upon her head and enveloping her\r\nfigure, ceaselessly carrying presents to servants, poor women, &c. She\r\nis really charming, with simple, sincere, cordial manners, and her\r\nhusband is most pleasant, the very best type of an Italian gentleman.\r\nDonna Olympia Colonna was at the tree--very bridal-looking, bright, and\r\npretty.\r\n\r\n“With the Prince I have ever more entire satisfaction. I constantly see\r\nmore of him, and have daily increasing affection for him. Of course the\r\nposition is not perfect, but I expect this in everything, and am quite\r\nsure of his absolute confidence to a degree which I never expected. I\r\nam happy in feeling that Rome _is_ doing for him all that the Queen\r\nhoped, but which I did not, and that he will return to her indescribably\r\nimproved in every way. I suppose people who have children of their own\r\nare familiar with it, but I could not have conceived before the interest\r\nof watching the gradual unfolding and expansion of a character to which\r\none utterly devotes oneself; and with him all was new, it was entirely\r\nfallow ground to work upon.\r\n\r\n“One day we went to Frascati by rail, taking with us Count and Countess\r\nBarnekow and Count and Countess Lievenhaupt, Swedes, and Lady Agnes\r\nDouglas. While Lady Agnes did the honours of some of the villas, M. de\r\nPrintzsköld and I got an excellent though thoroughly Roman dinner ready\r\nat the little inn, and afterwards the ladies had donkeys, the Prince a\r\nhorse, and we others walked up to Tuseulum. Here the Prince was very\r\nhappy picking up mosaics in the long grass, and eventually insisted on\r\nexcavating, and lugging back to Rome in his arms, a great mass, as big\r\nas that in the verandah at Holmhurst. We came down by the great desolate\r\nvilla of Mondragone, and returned to Rome in the evening laden with fern\r\nand butcher’s-broom, which, with its bright scarlet berries, is the\r\nRoman apology for holly.\r\n\r\n“The Prince _hates_ the churches, and generally has to be bribed to bear\r\nthem with equanimity by the promise of a little marble-hunt in some\r\nvineyard afterwards, when it is amusing to see the whole party fall to\r\ngrubbing simultaneously among the artichokes. It has been hard work\r\nrefusing the endless people who want to go with us, but besides Lady\r\nDunraven we have only admitted pretty little Miss Trollope, the\r\nhistorian’s daughter. I like Princess Teano very much, and am charmed\r\nwith her anxiety to make the very most of all she sees, and Lord\r\nHylton’s boy, George Jolliffe, is delightful, brimming with enthusiasm\r\nand intelligence.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 20, 1879._--Each day, as I have known the Prince Royal better, I\r\nhave liked him more. He has no sense of beauty and no care for it, and\r\nhe has naturally very few of my tastes, but he has the most transparent,\r\ntruthful, simple, loyal character I have ever known, and he has ever\r\nbeen unspeakably kind and affectionate to me. We have been wonderfully\r\nthrown together, even all the little circumstances intended by others to\r\ndivide us having acted the other way, and made us cling to each other\r\nwith truest friendship.\r\n\r\n“All the earlier part of the winter I continued my lectures for him, in\r\nwhich we visited almost every remarkable object in Rome. Our party was\r\nmuch increased latterly, one of its most interesting elements being the\r\nPrussian Countess Schulenberg, with whom I formed a great friendship. I\r\nwish now that I had written down the many conversations of interest I\r\nhad with her; she left suddenly in January to take care of a sick cousin\r\nin Germany.\r\n\r\n“One of the last evenings of the year was spent in the Palazzo Colonna\r\nwith the sweet little Duchess of Marino. She is a great addition and\r\nenlivenment to the dull egotistical Roman society, and is brimming with\r\ngood intentions and high aspirations, many of which she is really able\r\nto carry out. Greatly, for instance, did she astonish modern Rome, with\r\nits vulgar attempts at exclusiveness, by opening her rooms for a grand\r\nparty in the noble old Roman style, in which princes and sculptors met\r\non equal terms, and artists were as cordially received as if they were\r\nambassadors.\r\n\r\n“Amongst the acquaintance who came to me with the New Year were the\r\nDutch Minister and Madame de Westenberg, his American wife, from whom I\r\nhave received much cordiality. Other people with whom I have been\r\nintimate are the admirable Swedish Count and Countess Barnekow, the\r\nlatter especially charming, and full of life and intelligence. The Count\r\nhas been taking the post of consul here this year, but they have been\r\nwelcomed in all societies. There is something quite charming in their\r\nrelation to their children--little girls--and their influence over them.\r\nOf these, the second, Elisabet, was compelled at six years old to have\r\nher finger amputated. The mother prepared her for it, and told her how\r\nterribly it would add to her distress if she did not bear the operation\r\nbravely. The child said she could bear it if only they did not tell her\r\nit was nothing: she knew it was dreadful, but if no one attempted to\r\ndeceive her she could bear a dreadful thing. She sat on the surgeon’s\r\nknee while the finger was being taken off; she never uttered a sound,\r\nand when the operation was over, she kissed him to show she bore no\r\nmalice!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERUGIA.][294]\r\n\r\n“On the 16th of January I went, away with my Prince for a tour in\r\nTuscany. I very soon found that for me the trial of the tour would be\r\nhis hatred of fresh air. He never would have the carriage window\r\nopened, even on the hottest day and with steaming hot-water pans.\r\nOtherwise all was luxury, kindness, and comfort. We arrived at Perugia\r\non the most glorious evening I ever remember: violet mists were rolling\r\nthrough the valleys, the snow mountains were rosy in the sunset. It was\r\nsuch a scene as can only be enjoyed in Italy, and in Italy can only be\r\nfound in Umbria, perhaps only at Perugia. But the Prince was much more\r\ninterested in an illuminated church where there was a function in honour\r\nof S. Mauro. Next day we drove to Assisi, where he was far more\r\ndelighted at buying a little old silver box in a sidestreet than with\r\nall the old churches and monasteries. He travelled under the name of the\r\nComte de Tullgarn, and at Perugia no one found out who he was, which\r\nmade him very happy. At Florence, however, he was unfortunately\r\ndiscovered, and we found great preparations--two smart carriages waiting\r\nat the station, twenty-six candles and three lamps burning in our rooms,\r\nwith prices in proportion, and a serenade of music outside the windows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASSISI.][295]\r\n\r\n“Therefore, as soon as we arrived, I began to look up Florentine\r\nacquaintance, and called on the charming Marchesa Elisabetta Torrigiani,\r\nwho lives with her four sons, three of them married, in the greatest\r\nharmony, in the fine old Torrigiani palace. We dined with them, and were\r\ngreatly delighted with the three beautiful daughters-in-law, especially\r\nthe Marchesa Cristina, wife of Don Filippo, a member of the\r\nonce-sovereign house of Malaspina. The Marchese Pietro placed his\r\ncarriage at our disposal. The family of Corsini were also most civil to\r\nus, and their head, the Marchesa Lajatico, gave a great ball in honour\r\nof the Prince. Other parties were given to us by the Marchesa Cavoni,\r\nBaron de Talleyrand, Sir Digby and Lady Murray, and the Fenzis. One\r\nevening we spent with the C. de Bunsens, who asked many interesting\r\npeople, including Sir James Lacaita, Villari the historian, and the old\r\nDuc de Dino, to meet us. One beautiful day we drove out to Castagnuolo,\r\nwhere we were entertained in the ancient hill-set villa by the Marchese\r\ndella Stufa and Mrs. Ross, and the Prince fed all the rare birds, and\r\nvisited the farm and the wine-making.\r\n\r\n“On leaving Florence, the Prince and I had a really happy day together\r\nat Pisa. M. de Printzsköld was then sickening with Arno fever, and when\r\nwe were at Siena was unable to go out with us: with the others we drove\r\nto the mediaeval castle of Belcaro, whose owner, the Marchese Camajori,\r\nhad long been slightly known to me, and wandered much about the old\r\nstreets and into the shops of the antiquaries.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe returned to Rome on the 25th. My regular lectures were over then, but\r\nas the Prince missed our little parties, I had some for him to the\r\nvillas and galleries. At this time, as often afterwards, those who\r\nsurrounded the Prince gave me the opportunity of testing the truth of\r\nLord Chesterfield’s observation, that “courts are the best key to\r\ncharacters; there every passion is busy, every character analysed,” as\r\nwell as the dictum of La Bruyère, that at court “les joies sont visibles\r\nmais fausses, et les chagrins cachés mais réels.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Rome, Feb. 3, 1879._--I feel as if it must be dull reading letters\r\nonly about the Prince, but as I have not even the possibility of seeing\r\nmuch of any one else, what else can I say? I am obliged to give up\r\neverything to his lessons, his invitations, and to trying to help him to\r\nmake the most of all he sees. He enjoyed Pisa, where I saw the\r\nLimosins,[296] and we drove through the forest of San Rossore to the\r\nGombo, where the Prince and I sat long in the warm afternoon upon the\r\nlittle pier above the sea waves, which the dear Mother enjoyed so much\r\nthere in 1857. I often wonder if she knows what I am doing now, but I\r\nfeel sure she would be glad and satisfied that so much time should be\r\ngiven up to one who must one day influence tens of thousands. I have\r\nmany struggles now and much to contend with in the _position_, but with\r\nthe Prince himself have nothing but satisfaction. I tumbled downstairs\r\non Saturday night, and was so much hurt as to be all yesterday without\r\nseeing him: so to-day at eleven the donna announced--‘Un signorino.’ I\r\nwas sitting for my picture and was afraid of moving, so waited for the\r\nvisitor to come round from behind my chair, when behold the Prince, who\r\nhad escaped from his gentlemen, seized a little carriage in the street,\r\nand come off to me. I mention this as an example of the ever-pleasant\r\nterms I am on with him, and which make it impossible not to be fond of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“I am glad you like the Bunsen Memoirs on the whole. I knew you would\r\nnot agree with details. She always wondered, as I have always done,\r\n_how_ those who really love their Saviour, and wish to follow His\r\nprecepts, can reconcile themselves to setting up the great idol of\r\nSabbatarianism, _the_ sin against which He was most eager and earnest in\r\nwarning His disciples, and against which more of His teaching was\r\ndirected than any other single offence. She also thought, as I have\r\nalways done, that, next to churches (often misused), theatres (also\r\noften misused) were instruments which could be made most widely useful\r\nin leavening great numbers of people at once; and therefore she\r\nconsidered that an immaculate company and a play of high principles\r\nought always to be encouraged.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 13._--I have had a series of lectures for the Prince in the\r\nVatican galleries and St. Peter’s, and at the latter, by kindness of\r\nMonsignor Théodoli, had all the chapels of the crypt illuminated, and\r\nthe precious plate and vestments (Charlemagne’s robes, &c.) exhibited.\r\nWe climbed up to the cross, but the ladies of our little party succumbed\r\non the different roofs, except Lady Dunraven, who went with us to the\r\nball.\r\n\r\n“On the 4th I was with the Prince at a ball at the Palazzo Caffarelli,\r\nthe German embassy, which is much done up since Bunsen’s days and\r\nexceedingly magnificent. The great hall was entirely surrounded with\r\npalm-trees, under one of which I stood, with the Swedish Countess\r\nBarnekow, to watch the procession come in and the state quadrille--which\r\nQueen Marguerite danced with M. de Keudel, and my Prince with Mme. de\r\nKeudel--alone on the long sides of the room, with a perfect tourbillon\r\nof ambassadors and ambassadresses at the narrow ends. A much prettier\r\nball was that at Palazzo Caëtani. This the Prince had to open with the\r\nQueen, so we had to be there by eleven, but _because_ the King and Queen\r\nwere to be there, all the great nobles stayed away, so for once Palazzo\r\nCaëtani did not shine. The Queen looked lovely, but, ever since the\r\nattack on the King, has been more nervous than ever, perpetually picking\r\nat her gloves, twisting her fan, and shaking out the folds of her dress.\r\nHer beautiful hair was full of marguerites in diamonds. The King looked\r\nglaring and demoniacal, yet really is going on very well, and does all\r\nhe can to sweep away the abuses and immoralities of his father’s court,\r\nunpopular as it makes him with his father’s sycophants. Yesterday I was\r\nwith the Prince at a great ball at Prince Altieri’s--the blackest of the\r\n‘black’ houses--where I had the great pleasure of seeing again my\r\nsister’s dear friend the Duchess Sora, who has lived in a sort of exile\r\nhitherto, ever since the Sardinian occupation of Rome.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday morning I went with the Prince to the antiquity market in the\r\nCampo de’ Fiore. We left the carriage in the courtyard of the\r\nCancelleria, and made a raid upon the old bookstalls, till our arms\r\nwere quite full, and then we deposited our burthens and made another.\r\nThe Prince is getting on wonderfully with his English, and will talk\r\nfluently by the time he reaches London. I see him ceaselessly. He has\r\nbeen twice to my lodgings to-day, and I have been out with him besides.\r\nHe dances till 4 A.M. every night now (it is Carnival), but is never\r\ntired, and up at eight.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 24._--My present work is likely to end for a time on Thursday,\r\nwhen my dear Prince goes to Naples and Sorrento. On looking back, I have\r\nunmixed satisfaction that I came. He leaves Rome quite a different\r\nperson from the Prince I found here--much strengthened, and I am sure\r\nmuch improved in character, as well as speaking and reading English and\r\nFrench (which he did not know before), and being able to take a lively\r\nanimated part in a society in which he was previously a cypher. Of\r\ncourse, I personally have been able to do very little more than\r\nintroduce him and constantly throw him with those who have influenced\r\nhim, and I have been most ably seconded and helped in everything I\r\nwished for him by Lady Morton, the Sermonetas, Princess Teano, and--in\r\nher own way--by Lady Paget. To me he has been unfailingly pleasant. I\r\nhave never had a difficulty with him.\r\n\r\n“We have been together several times in the Vatican, with Monsignor\r\nPericoli, at the sale of Pius IX.’s things--quantities of things, from\r\nvaluable pictures and sculptures to empty jam-pots; but touching in many\r\nways, especially the boxes of the well-worn Papal slippers. All is\r\nobliged to be sold, as the produce is divided into three parts--one to\r\nthe family, one to the cardinals-in-waiting, and the third to the\r\nChurch. The Prince bought some valuable amethysts, and I have the Papal\r\ndespatch-box engraved with his arms, a picture which hung in his room,\r\nand a pair of the Papal slippers.\r\n\r\n“For the last ten days we have been in all the dirt and squalor of the\r\nsilly, filthy Carnival, which is more _mesquin_ and contemptible than\r\never; but the Prince is only twenty, and it has amused him. I have only\r\nbeen obliged to go with him to the Corso one day, when we went to\r\none-o’clock luncheon with the Dutch Minister, and were astonished to\r\nfind every shutter closed, chandeliers and candles lighted, ladies in\r\nwhite satin and diamonds, gentlemen in evening dress; in fact, midnight\r\nat midday! so that the Prince and I felt rather shy. However, Mrs. Bruce\r\ncheered us by appearing in a bonnet.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI saw much at this time of Madame Minghetti, the wife of the senator,\r\nstill wonderfully beautiful and captivating, though a grandmother. Her\r\nrooms were draped with every possible nuance of colour which can\r\nharmonise together, great palm-trees and bananas shaded the sofas and\r\narm-chairs, and the heavy curtains only let in witching rays of half\r\nlight upon a gorgeous gloom. Here, in her receptions in the early Sunday\r\nafternoon, she would sit upon the floor and sing, break off in the\r\nmiddle of a line to receive or embrace some one, and, in an instant, be\r\nagain in her place, singing as before and taking up the line which was\r\nleft unfinished.\r\n\r\nAnother new friend was the pretty lively Princess of Salm Reifferscheid,\r\nwhom, with her husband, I invited to accompany us to Tivoli, when the\r\nPrince gave me a carriage and told me to ask whom I liked. At Tivoli our\r\nparty had a charming day, riding on eleven donkeys, penetrating into the\r\ndepths of the cascades, having luncheon in front of the temple, and\r\nsitting in the sun opposite the cascatelle. At sunset we were at the\r\nVilla d’Este, and went down into the hollow to look up at the grand old\r\nvilla, golden through the dark cypresses.\r\n\r\nI saw, however, comparatively little of those who usually make the\r\npleasure of my Roman winter, and devoted myself to the Prince. There is\r\nno use--none--in trying to be, or to do, two things at once.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“Here is a story which I have heard lately:--\r\n\r\n“Lady Vernon[297] dreamt. She dreamt that she saw the butler, with a\r\nknife in one hand and a candle in the other, crossing the entrance hall,\r\nand she woke with a great start. After a little she composed herself to\r\nsleep again, and she dreamt--she dreamt that she saw the butler, with a\r\nknife in one hand and a candle in the other, on the middle of the\r\nstaircase, and she woke with a great shock. She got up; she thought she\r\ncould not be quite well, and she took a little sal-volatile. At last she\r\nfell asleep again, and she dreamt--she dreamt that she saw the butler,\r\nwith a knife in one hand and a candle in the other, standing at her\r\nbedroom door; and she awoke in a great terror, and she jumped out of\r\nbed, and she said: ‘I’ll have an end of this, I’ll have an end of these\r\nfoolish imaginations,’ and she rushed to the door, and she threw the\r\ndoor wide open. And there at the door _stood_ the butler, with a knife\r\nin one hand and a candle in the other. And when he suddenly saw Lady\r\nVernon in her white night-dress, with her hair streaming down her back,\r\n_he_ was so dreadfully frightened that he dropped the candle on the\r\nground and rushed off down the staircase, and off to the stables where\r\nthere was a horse ready saddled and bridled, on which he meant to have\r\nridden away when he had murdered Lady Vernon; and he rode away without\r\never having murdered her at all, and he was never, never, _never_ heard\r\nof again.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of March, a well-known partnership of upwards of sixty years\r\nwas closed at Rome by the death, in his little apartment at 55 Via\r\nSistina, of William Howitt the author leaving his sweet old Mary[298]\r\nalone with her unmarried daughter Margaret. Though never very\r\nremarkable, the many books of William and Mary Howitt were always\r\nexcellent, and the writers were deeply respected. I attended Mr.\r\nHowitt’s funeral on the 5th, walking with Mrs. Terry, Baron Hoffmann,\r\nand Prince George of Solms, immediately after the daughter and\r\nson-in-law. The ceremony was a very touching one, and the coffin buried\r\nin wreaths of camellias, lilies, and violets. As William Howitt was a\r\nQuaker, the service was different from ours, but hymns were beautifully\r\nsung over his coffin in the chapel and at the grave, where the American\r\nclergyman, Dr. Nevin, gave a really touching and beautiful address, as\r\nthe daughter was pouring basket after basket of flowers into the open\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nI dined with the Prince on the day before that fixed for his departure\r\nto Naples. When our last moment together came, he took me into his room\r\nand parted from me there, with many most affectionate words, and gave\r\nme the Order of St. Olaf, which the King of Sweden and Norway had\r\nconferred upon me, begging me to wear it for his sake.[299] I left him\r\nwith the truest affection, and with, I think, unbounded confidence and\r\nregard on both sides.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_From the_ COUNTESS ROSEN.\r\n\r\n“_February 23._--As the Prince’s stay in Rome is now drawing to its\r\nclose, their Majesties charge me once more to express to you their most\r\nheartfelt thanks for all your kindness to the Prince, all the good and\r\nuseful influence you have had over him, and all your arrangements to\r\ncombine the useful with the amusing in order to kindle his interest.\r\nTheir Majesties have always been so happy to know that you were at his\r\nside and smoothed all his difficulties. In his own letters the Prince\r\nshows that he has learnt to love and appreciate you, and is thankful for\r\nall you have done for him.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE ENTRANCE HALL, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 28, 1879._--You ask if I was alarmed over my lectures with the\r\nPrince, and found them difficult. No, not very. From the first I thought\r\nof what Johnson told Sir J. Reynolds, and I tried to do the same. He\r\ntold him that he had ‘early laid it down as a fixed rule to do his best\r\non every occasion, and in every company: to impart whatever he knew in\r\nthe most forcible language he could put it in, and that by constant\r\npractice and by never suffering any careless expressions to escape him,\r\nor attempting to deliver his thoughts without arranging them in the\r\nclearest manner, it had become habitual to him.’ So you see that I have\r\nbeen fortifying myself by wise advice! And I am sure that it is the\r\n_way_ in which things are said that fixes them in the mind.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“Fabj. Altini, the sculptor, says Thorwaldsen declared clay to be the\r\nlife of art, plaster its death, and marble its resurrection.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. F. Walker told me how she went out one evening at Freshwater to\r\nmeet her brother-in-law and niece as they were returning from an\r\nexcursion along the cliffs. On her way she saw a lady in deep mourning,\r\nwith a little boy, emerge apparently from a side path to the one on\r\nwhich she was, and walk on before her. She noticed the lady’s peculiarly\r\nlight step. Mother and son stopped at a little railed-in enclosure at\r\nthe top of the hill, and gazed over the railings; then they went on\r\nagain in front of her. At length, beyond them, Mrs. Walker saw Mr.\r\nPalmes and his daughter coming to meet her. Between her and them she saw\r\nthe lady and boy suddenly disappear--apparently go down some side path\r\nleading to the sands; but, when she came to the place, there was _no_\r\npath, the cliff was perfectly precipitous. Miss Palmes equally saw the\r\nlady and boy coming towards her, and was greatly agitated by their\r\nsudden disappearance.\r\n\r\n“Afterwards they found that the same sight was constantly seen there. It\r\nwas the little boy’s grave into which the two had gazed. He had fallen\r\nover the cliff just there and been killed, and was buried by his\r\nmother’s wish inside that little circular railing.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Prince was in Rome for one night on his way from Naples to Munich, I\r\nwent to him in the early morning, and was with him till 2 P.M., when he\r\nleft, spending the time in driving about with him, chiefly to the\r\nantiquity shops, in which he always had the greatest delight. The very\r\nday after he left I fell in with other royalties, of whom at first I\r\nseemed likely to see a great deal. I was at the Princess Giustiniani\r\nBandini’s, when the Hereditary Grand Duke and Duchess of Saxe-Weimar\r\nwere announced--a very simple homely pair. The lady-in-waiting, hearing\r\nmy name, most cleverly recollected all about me, and I was presented,\r\nand very cordially and kindly received. A few days after, Princess Teano\r\nasked me to meet them at dinner. Only the Keudells of the German Embassy\r\nand the Minghettis dined besides the family, but an immense party came\r\nin the evening. The Hereditary Grand Duke is a weak-looking little man\r\nwith a very receding forehead. The Grand Duchess (who was his cousin) is\r\na fine big woman--“bel pezzo di carne”--with intense enjoyment and\r\ngood-humour in everything. “How can anybody be ill, how is it possible\r\nthat anybody can be unhappy in Rome!” Both talked English perfectly.\r\nThey arranged then that I should show them the Palatine. But a few days\r\nafterwards I heard from the Duchess Sermoneta that the Grand Duchess\r\nhad said to her that, owing to the furious jealousy of the German\r\narchaeologists, she was unable to go with me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_March 17, 1879._--At Mrs. Terry’s I have met again her sister, Mrs.\r\nJulia Ward-Howe, the American poetess. When she wanted me to talk to her\r\nand I did not, she said, ‘In your case, Mr. Hare, I must pervert a text\r\nof Scripture--“to do good and to _communicate_ forget not.”’\r\n\r\n“I have seen much, almost daily, of Lord Hylton’s young son, George\r\nJolliffe, for whom I have an affection ever increased by his confidence\r\nin me, which makes me feel more of responsibility as an instrument of\r\npossible good in his case than I have ever done in any other. He is a\r\ndelightful companion in Rome, so full of interest and enthusiasm in all\r\nwe see.... We went together yesterday to the Palazzo Massimo alle\r\nColonne, where the old blackened portico was hung with bright tapestry,\r\nand the whole staircase and rooms strewn with box, because it was the\r\nday on which S. Filippo Neri raised the Massimo child from the dead.\r\nMost surprising were the masses of people--cobblers and contadini\r\nelbowing cardinals up the long staircase, washerwomen on their knees\r\ncrowding princesses round the altar. Prince Massimo, in full evening\r\ndress, received in the anteroom of the chapel, and the Princess\r\n(daughter of the Duchesse de Berri) invited every one she knew to have\r\nices and coffee.\r\n\r\n“I went afterwards to Miss Howitt, who talked cheerfully about her\r\nfather. ‘Rome might possibly not be the place to live in, but it\r\ncertainly was the place to die and be buried in.’ She spoke of the\r\nextraordinary shots made at her father’s life by the English\r\nnewspapers--how one of them described her mother’s daily walk on the\r\nPincio by the side of a Bath-chair which ‘contained an ancient man,’\r\n&c., the fact being that her mother never walked, that her father always\r\nwalked, and moreover that there was no Bath-chair in Rome.\r\n\r\n“Last night I was at the British Embassy till 1 A.M. I conquered shyness\r\nsufficiently to go and talk to the Grand Duchess, though she sat in a\r\nrow of princesses.

It\r\nwas a lovely day of soft scirocco, fleecy clouds floating over the pale\r\npink mountain distances and the Campagna bursting into its first green,\r\nacross which the long chains of aqueduct arches threw their deep\r\nshadows. Crowds of people and carriages were out, but we followed\r\nPrincess Teano, who knew all the ups and downs of the ground, and drove\r\nwith young Lady Clarendon so cleverly, that we were in at the death in\r\nthe great ruins of Sette Basse.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 21._--Tea with Countess Primoli (Princess Charlotte Bonaparte)\r\nin her little boudoir at the end of a long suite of quaint old-fashioned\r\nrooms.

It is a beautiful place, and the noble face\r\nof Madame Favart is worthy of its setting. Consolo was there and played\r\nmarvellously on the violin, every nerve seeming to vibrate, every hair\r\nto leap in unison with his chords.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 23._--Once more I am on the eve of leaving Rome, more sorry to\r\npart with my little winter rooms than I ever expected to be; even my\r\nugly squinting donna, ‘Irene,’ having proved very good and faithful. The\r\ntime here has been full of interests, independent of royal ones--one of\r\nthem, the going out to India of Frank Marion Crawford, the son of my\r\ndear friend Mrs. Terry. He would probably have done no work in Europe,\r\nthough he has evinced an ambitious perseverance by voluntarily pursuing\r\nthe study of Sanscrit--‘because it was so difficult,’ and this has\r\nenabled him to accept a vacant professorship in the University at\r\nBombay.”[300]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Florence, March 27._--I left Rome on Tuesday--a lovely morning, and I\r\nlooked my last at the glorious view from the Medici Terrace with a heavy\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n“Now I am in the old Palazzo Mozzi at Florence, as the guest of the\r\nSermonetas. On the side towards the Via dei Bardi the palace rises up\r\ngaunt and grim like a fortress, but at the back it looks into a\r\nbeautiful garden, with terraces climbing up the steep hillside to the\r\nold city wall. The rooms are large and dreadfully cold, but the Duchess\r\nhas made them very picturesque with old hangings and furniture. The Duke\r\ntalks incessantly and cleverly. I asked him why his Duchess signed\r\n‘Harriet Caëtani,’ not ‘Sermoneta,’ and he explained how all the\r\nsplendour of the family arose from the fact that they were Caëtani; that\r\nmany of the greatest of the old families, such as the Frangipani, had no\r\ntitles at all: that even the Orsini had no title of place, and that it\r\nwas only modern families, like the Braschi, who cared to air a title.\r\nThe oldest title in Italy was that of Marchese, which came in with the\r\nFrench: Duke came with the Imperialists; but the title of Prince, for\r\nwhich he had the utmost contempt, was merely the result of Papal\r\nnepotism: Borghese was the first Prince created.\r\n\r\n“The Duke declared that the word ‘antimonial’ was really ‘antimonacal.’\r\nThe alchemists who lived in the old convents used to throw out of the\r\nwindows the water which they had used in their search after the\r\nphilosopher’s stone: pigs drank the poisoned water and died: monks\r\n(monaci) ate the pigs and died also: hence the expression.\r\n\r\n“The Duke is very adverse to open windows: ‘If I want the air I can go\r\nout into the piazza,’ he says. To his relations, for the most part, he\r\ngreatly objects--‘Questi sono i flagelli di questo mondo.’ A monk or\r\nnun, he says, is ‘Un insétto chi puo vivere senza aria a senza acqua.’\r\n\r\n“We have been at a large party at the Palazzo Torrigiani, and it has\r\nbeen a great pleasure to see again the many members of the large,\r\npleasant, amiable Florentine society.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving undertaken to devote myself exclusively to the Prince Royal had\r\nmade me give up all my usual employments during this Roman winter of\r\n1878-79. The chief event in my life disconnected with the Prince was my\r\nbeing asked to open the session of the British and American\r\nArchaeological Society. This I long refused, urging that many others\r\nwere more worthy and competent, but it was insisted upon, and, to my\r\ngreat surprise, I found myself speaking to a crowded meeting words which\r\nI had written down before, but which I never found any need of referring\r\nto. Here they are (for I have preserved them nowhere else) from the\r\nnotes I made:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“The Secretary of this Society conferred upon me a most unexpected\r\nhonour when he asked me to open this meeting. I could have wished that\r\nhe had selected some one more worthy of that honour, for not only am I\r\nunaccustomed to public speaking, but I may truly say that I never made a\r\nspeech in my life. I will therefore hope that my many deficiencies--my\r\nmore than many deficiencies, may be either overlooked or pardoned.\r\n\r\n“But, though the Secretary could have found many persons in Rome better\r\nable to address you, with more power of doing justice to their subject\r\nthan myself, he could not have found one to whom Rome was dearer, about\r\nwhose heart all its sympathies were more tenderly and closely entwined.\r\nLong and intimate family association, perhaps the very fact of having a\r\nbirthplace in the once beautiful Villa Strozzi, have added to that sense\r\nwhich comes to so many, of looking upon Rome as a second home--a home as\r\nfamiliar almost, quite as tenderly beloved, as the home in far-away\r\nEngland. How truly Chateaubriand has said that those who have nothing\r\nleft in life should turn their footsteps to Rome: there the very stones\r\ncan waken into speech; there the very dust beneath our feet can kindle\r\ninto memories of a past ever fresh and ever sacred. To those who come\r\nhere first as strangers, the decay, the stagnation, the ruin of\r\neverything may be oppressive; they may see only the bareness of the\r\nstuccoed streets, they may grumble at the rough pavements, they may be\r\nwearied with the petty discomforts and difficulties of daily and\r\npractical life:--but no matter! If they only stay here long enough, the\r\nlove of Rome will insidiously creep upon them; they will feel it\r\ndifficult to tear themselves away from it; and, when they have left it,\r\nit will ever come back to them--in silent hours, in visions of the\r\nnight--grand ruins lying in silent slumbrous solitude; desolate\r\nvineyards flower-carpeted; beautiful villas, where the ancient ilex\r\navenues are peopled with marble statues, relics of a mythical past\r\nwhich in Rome seems almost as real as the present; and above all, the\r\nrecollection of a mighty purple dome embossed upon a sky whose sunset\r\nglory recalls the splendours of the New Jerusalem--first a sapphire,\r\nthen a chalcedony, then an emerald, then a chrysopraz, last an amethyst.\r\n\r\n“In regard to how many Roman scenes do we echo such thoughts as Clough\r\nhas expressed in his beautiful lines to the Alban Mount:--\r\n\r\n    ‘Alba, thou findest me still, and, Alba, thou findest me ever,\r\n       Now from the Capitol steps, now over Titus’s arch,\r\n     Here where the large grassy spaces stretch from the Lateran portal,\r\n       Towering o’er aqueduct lines lost in perspective between,\r\n     Or from a Vatican window, or bridge, or the high Coliseum,\r\n       Clear by the garlanded line cut of the Flavian ring.\r\n     Beautiful can I not call thee, and yet thou hast power to o’ermaster,\r\n     Power of mere beauty; in dreams, Alba, thou hauntest me still.’\r\n\r\n“What Madame Swetchine says of life, that you find in it exactly what\r\nyou put into it, is also true of Rome, and those who come to it with\r\nleast mental preparation are those least fitted to enjoy it. That\r\npreparation, however, is not so easy as it used to be. In the old days,\r\nthe happy old days of vetturíno travelling, there were so many quiet\r\nhours, when the country was not too beautiful, and the towns not too\r\ninteresting, when Gibbon, and Merivale, and Milman were the pleasantest\r\nof travelling companions, and when books of art and poetry served to\r\nillustrate and illuminate the graver studies which were making Italy\r\nnot only a beautiful panorama, but a country filled with forms which\r\nwere daily growing into more familiar acquaintance. Perugia and Spoleto,\r\nTerni and Civita Castellana, led fitly up then to the greater interests\r\nof Rome, as courtiers to a king. But in the journeys of the present, the\r\nhurried traveller has not these opportunities of preparation, and must\r\nrest upon his home-knowledge, and such reading as he can find time for\r\nin Rome itself. To such travellers--to those, I mean, who wish to take\r\naway from Rome something more than a mere surface impression--I would\r\ngive one piece of advice gathered from long experience: Never see too\r\nmuch; most of all, never see too much at once; never try to ‘do’ Rome.\r\nBetter far to leave half the ruins and nine-tenths of the churches\r\nunseen, and to see well the rest, to see them not once, but again and\r\noften again, to watch them, to learn them, to live with them, to love\r\nthem, till they become a part of your life and your life’s\r\nrecollections.\r\n\r\n“Thus, too, in the galleries. What can be carried away by those who\r\nwander over all the Vatican at once but a hopeless chaos of marble\r\nlimbs, at best a nightmare of Venuses and Mercurys and Jupiters and\r\nJunos? But if the traveller would benefit by the Vatican, let him make\r\nfriends with a few of the statues, and pay them visits, and grow into\r\ngreater intimacy:--then will the purity of their outlines, the majestic\r\nserenity of their godlike grace, have power over him, raising his spirit\r\nto a perception of creations of beauty of which he had no idea before,\r\nand enabling him to discern the traces of that noblest gift of God which\r\nmen call ‘genius’ in the humblest works of those who, while they have\r\nfound the true and right path which leads to the great end, are still\r\nvery far off.\r\n\r\n“I would urge those who are sight-seeing at Rome to read twice about\r\nthat which they see, before they see it, to prepare themselves for the\r\nsight, and after they have seen it, to fix the sight in their\r\nrecollection. I would also urge all archaeologists to believe that it is\r\nnot in one class of Roman interests alone that much is to be learnt;\r\nthat those who devote themselves exclusively to the relics of the kings\r\nand the Republic, to the walls, or to the vexed questions concerning the\r\nPorta Capena, and who see no interest in the reminiscences of the Middle\r\nAges, and the memorials of the saints and of the popes, take only half\r\nthe blessing of Rome, and the half which has the least of human sympathy\r\nin it. They are blind of one eye, because they see with the other: they\r\nare like the foolish Athenians, who have lately pulled down the noble\r\nVenetian towers on the Acropolis because they were not Greek.\r\n\r\n“Besides this, one should recollect that important relics of Pagan Rome\r\nare to be found elsewhere--at Nismes and Treves beyond the Alps, and at\r\nmany places in Northern Italy; but the memorials of Christian Rome, and\r\nof its early bishops and martyrs, are to be found only in Rome and its\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUGUSTUS J. C. HARE\r\n\r\n1879]\r\n\r\n“Those who wish to fix the scenes and events of Roman history securely\r\nin their minds will do best to take them in groups. Suppose, for\r\ninstance, that people wish to study the story of St. Laurence. Let them\r\nfirst visit the beautiful little chapel in the Vatican, where the whole\r\nstory of the saint’s life is portrayed in the lovely frescoes of\r\nAngelico da Fiesole. Let them stand on the green sward by the Navicella,\r\nwhere he distributed the treasures of the church in front of the house\r\nof St. Ciriaca. Let them walk through the crypto-porticus of the\r\nPalatine, up which he was dragged to his trial. Let them lean against\r\nthe still existing bar of the basilica, where he knelt to receive his\r\nsentence. Let them visit S. Lorenzo in Fonte, where he was imprisoned,\r\nand baptized his fellow-prisoners in the fountain which gives the church\r\nits name. Let them go hence to S. Lorenzo Pane e Perna, built upon the\r\nscene of his terrific martyrdom, which is there portrayed in fresco. Let\r\nthem see his traditional chains, and the supposed gridiron of his\r\nsuffering at S. Lorenzo in Lucina; and, lastly, at the great basilica of\r\nS. Lorenzo fuori le Mura let them admire the mighty church which for\r\n1200 years has marked the site of that little chapel which Constantine\r\nbuilt near the lowly catacomb grave in which the martyr was laid by his\r\ndeacon Hippolytus.\r\n\r\n“Let us turn to a very different character. Let us turn to Rienzi. How\r\nvivid will his story seem to those who go first to the old tower of the\r\nCrescenzi near the Bocca della Verità, which belonged to his ancestors,\r\nand then to the street behind S. Tommaso where he was born--the son of a\r\npublican and a washerwoman, for to such humble offices were the\r\nCrescenzi then reduced. They will find Rienzi again at the little church\r\nof S. Angelo in Pescheria, whither he summoned the citizens at midnight\r\nto hold a meeting for the re-establishment of ‘the Good Estate,’ and in\r\nwhich he kept the Vigil of the Holy Ghost--and at the Portico of\r\nOctavia, on whose ancient walls he painted his famous picture\r\nallegorical of the sufferings of the Romans under the oppression of the\r\ngreat patrician families, thus flaunting defiance in the eyes of the\r\nSavelli, who could look down upon the picture from the windows of their\r\npalace above the Theatre of Marcellus. At S. Giorgio in Velabro the\r\npediment still remains under the old terra-cotta cornice where an\r\ninscription proclaimed that the reign of the Good Estate was begun. We\r\nmust follow Rienzi thence, bareheaded, but in full armour, to the\r\nCapitol, and to the Lateran, where he took his mystic bath in the great\r\nvase of green basalt in which Constantine is falsely said to have been\r\nbaptized. We must think of his flight, after his short-lived glories\r\nwere over, by the light of the burning palace, down the steps of the\r\nCapitol, and of his wife looking out of the window to witness his murder\r\nat the foot of the great basaltic lioness, which looks scarcely older\r\nnow than on the night on which it was sprinkled with his blood. Lastly,\r\nwe may remember that his body was hung, a target for the stones of those\r\nby whom he was so lately adored, in the little piazza of S. Marcello in\r\nthe Corso, and that, in strange contradiction, it was eventually burnt\r\nby the Jews in the desolate mausoleum of Augustus, surrounded by Roman\r\nemperors, in a fire of dried thistles, till not a fibre of it remained.\r\n\r\n“Let us take one more character from a much later time. Let us take\r\nBeatrice Cenci. In the depths of the Ghetto, ghastly and grim, still\r\nstands the old palace of Francesco Cenci, whose colossal rooms and dark\r\npassages were the scene of her long misery. Hard by is the little\r\nchurch which one of that wretched family built in the hope of expiating\r\nits crimes. As we walk through the wearisome Tor di Nona on our way to\r\nS. Peter’s, we may think of the old tower which gave the street its\r\nname, in which the beautiful young girl is said to have undergone for\r\nforty hours the torture of the ‘vigilia,’ followed by the still more\r\nterrific agony called ‘tortura capillorum.’ At Sta. Maria Maggiore we\r\nmay look upon the stern face of Clement VIII., the cruel judge who knew\r\nno mercy, and who, in answer to all pleadings in their behalf, bade that\r\nthe whole Cenci family should be dragged by wild horses through the\r\nstreets of Rome. The ancient Santa Croce palace still stands, in which\r\nthe Marchesa Santa Croce was murdered by her two sons on the night in\r\nwhich a last effort was being made for the pardon of Beatrice--an event\r\nwhich sealed her fate. In the Corte Savelli we may think of her terrible\r\nexecution. Before the high altar of S. Pietro in Montorio she reposes\r\nfrom her long agony. And finally, we must go to the Palazzo Barberini,\r\nwhere, in the picture which Guido Reni is said to have painted in her\r\nprison, we may gaze upon the pale composure of her transcendent\r\nloveliness.\r\n\r\n“It is by thus entwining one sight with another, till they become the\r\ncontinuous links of a story, that they are best fixed in the mind. They\r\nshould also be read about, not merely in guide-books, but in the works\r\nof those who, from long residence in Italy and the deep love which they\r\nbear to it, have become impressed with the true Italian spirit. Amongst\r\nsuch books none are more delightful than the many volumes of\r\nGregorovius, from his ‘History of the City of Rome’ to his enchanting\r\n‘Lateinische Sommer,’ and his graphic little sketches of the\r\nburial-places of the Popes. I have often been laughed at for constantly\r\nrecommending and quoting novels in speaking of Rome and its interests;\r\nyet in few graver works are such glimpses of Rome, of Roman scenery,\r\nRoman character, Roman manners to be obtained as in Hawthorne’s ‘Marble\r\nFaun,’ which English publishers so foolishly call ‘Transformation;’ in\r\n‘Mademoiselle Mori;’ in the ‘Improvisatore’ of Hans Christian Andersen;\r\nin the ‘Daniella’ of George Sand; and, will my audience be unutterably\r\nshocked if I add, in the Pagan-spirited ‘Ariadne’ of Ouida. The writers\r\nof these books have really known Rome and loved it, and yet several of\r\nthem have only spent one or two winters here. The same knowledge, the\r\nsame inspiration, is open to all of us, and the reason why English and\r\nAmerican visitors so seldom carry away from Rome more than they bring to\r\nit is because they have never seen it at all; because the life in a\r\nhotel, with its English and French dinners, its English or\r\nFrench-speaking waiters, its newspapers and reading-rooms, is not a\r\nRoman life; because the shop-keepers in the Via Condotti, their\r\nwasherwomen, or their masters of music and languages, are the only\r\nItalians these visitors have come in contact with; because their sights\r\nare doled out to them by conceited couriers or ignorant ciceroni;\r\nbecause they have no ideas of the peasants and their costumes beyond the\r\nmodels of the Via Felice and the Trinità de’ Monti.\r\n\r\n“And all this might be so different! Can one look at the amethystine\r\nmountains which girdle in the Campagna around Rome without wishing to\r\npenetrate their recesses? In the mountain towns which hang like eagles’\r\nnests to their rocks there are not only costumes, but every one wears a\r\ncostume: there the true Italian life may be seen. By the railway which\r\nleads to Naples it is very easy now to reach many of these beautiful\r\nplaces and to have glimpses of a true Italy. The grand temples of Cori,\r\nthe rock-perched Norba, and mysterious beautiful flower-peopled Ninfa\r\nmay now be visited in one day from the station of Velletri, returning to\r\nRome in the evening. At Sora near Arpino, the gloriously situated home\r\nof Cicero and of Marius, and at San Germano, close to Monte Cassino and\r\nto Aquino with its beautiful Roman arches of triumph, there are now very\r\ntolerable hotels; and oh! believe me, there is no enjoyment more intense\r\nthan that of spring days on these lonely mountain heights carpeted with\r\nsweet basil and thyme, or in these old desolate cities where the women\r\ncome up from the fountains with great brazen _conche_ poised upon their\r\nblack locks, like animated caryatides.\r\n\r\n“But I would also urge those who cannot make these excursions to do at\r\nleast something which will give them an individual interest, a personal\r\nproperty in Rome itself. Let them collect marbles or plants, or even\r\nphotographs, or let them make sketches, choosing perhaps some special\r\nline of interest, either the ancient Roman remains, or the memorials of\r\nthe saints, or the mediaeval tombs, thus appropriating and having their\r\nown little personal share in the great field of archaeology. I remember\r\nthat two English ladies,[301] long valued members of the society here,\r\nmade a perfect collection of drawings of all the mediaeval towers in\r\nRome, whether campanile of the churches, or old brick fortresses of the\r\nAnicii and Frangipani. I have known another lady, a much honoured\r\nAmerican resident in this place,[302] who spent much of her time in\r\nmaking a perfect collection of drawings and photographs of all Italian\r\nsubjects connected with Dante. And, depend upon it, that the very fact\r\nthat these persons thus created for themselves a private centre around\r\nwhich all other interests should circle, gave them a wider grasp and an\r\neasier remembrance for all that came across them.\r\n\r\n“Archaeology is generally regarded as a dead and dry study, though it\r\nneed not be so. But its animating power is history, and to bring it into\r\nlife it must be combined with history, not in its narrowest, but in its\r\nwidest sense. To a life-long student of classical details, it may be a\r\nmatter of vital importance whether a stone on the Palatine is of the\r\ntime of the kings or the Republic; but to the casual visitor to Rome, to\r\nthe ladies who form so great a portion of my present audience, this can\r\nscarcely be a question of thrilling excitement. To the unlearned, I\r\nbelieve it to be of more interest to reflect upon the gladiatorial\r\ncombats and the Christian martyrdoms in the Coliseum than to discuss the\r\nexact manner in which its sheltering velarium was sustained.\r\n\r\n“Let our Roman archaeology, then, be unlimited as to ages, let it grasp\r\nas much as it can of the myriad human sympathies which Rome has to\r\noffer or awaken; for thus, and only thus, can it do a great work, in\r\narousing highest thoughts and aims, as it opens the ancient\r\ntreasure-house and teaches the vast experience of more than two thousand\r\nyears. Then, as John Addington Symonds says:--\r\n\r\n    ‘Then from the very soil of ancient Rome\r\n     You shall grow wise, and walking, live again\r\n     The lives of buried peoples, and become\r\n     A child by right of that eternal home,\r\n     Cradle and grave of empires, on whose walls,\r\n     The sun himself subdued to reverence falls.’\r\n\r\n“Let archaeology help the beauties of Rome in leaving their noblest\r\nimpress--in arousing feelings which are worthy of the greatest of Pagan\r\nheroes, of the sweetest of Latin poets, of the most inspired of\r\nsculptors and painters, as well as of Paul of Tarsus, who passed into\r\nRome under the arch of Drusus, upon whom the shadow of the pyramid of\r\nCaius Cestius fell as he passed out of Rome to his martyrdom, in that\r\nprocession of which it is the sole surviving witness, and who here in\r\nRome is sleeping now, with thousand other saints, till, as St. Ambrose\r\nreminds us, he shall awaken _here_, in Rome, at the great resurrection.\r\n\r\n“Rome, as Winckelmann says, is the high-art school which is open to all\r\nthe world. It can supply every mental requirement, if people will only\r\napply at the right corner of the fountain. This is what an\r\narchaeological society ought to help us to find: this is what I trust\r\nthe British and American Archaeological Society may help us to find.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_April 29, 1879, London._--I have heard again the curious story of Sir\r\nT. Watson from Mrs. T., to whom he told it himself, so will write it\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n“Sir Thomas Watson, better known as Dr. Watson, was a well-known\r\nphysician. During the last years of his life he was in failing health,\r\nand only saw patients at his own house, but till then he went about in\r\nEngland wherever he was sent for. One day he was summoned to attend an\r\nurgent case at Oxenholme in Cumberland. There was only one carriage in\r\nthe train which went through to Oxenholme, and in a compartment of that\r\ncarriage he took his seat. He tipped the guard, and said he should be\r\nglad to be alone if he could.\r\n\r\n“The train at Euston was already in motion, when a young lady came\r\nrunning down the platform, with a porter laden with her hand-bags and\r\ncloaks. The man just contrived to open the carriage door, push the young\r\nlady in, throw in her things after her, and the train was off. The young\r\nlady, a very pretty, pleasing young lady, took the seat opposite Dr.\r\nWatson. Being a polite, gallant old gentleman, very soon Dr. Watson\r\nbegan to make himself agreeable: ‘What beautiful effects of cloud there\r\nwere. How picturesque Harrow church steeple looked through the morning\r\nhaze,’ &c. &c., and the young lady responded pleasantly. At last, as\r\ntheir acquaintance advanced, Dr. Watson said, ‘And are you travelling\r\nfar?’ ‘Oh yes,’ said the young lady, ‘very far, I am going to Oxenholme\r\nin Cumberland.’ ‘How singular,’ said Dr. Watson, ‘for that is just where\r\nI am going myself. I wonder if you happen to know Lady D. who lives\r\nnear Oxenholme.’ ‘Yes,’ said the young lady, ‘I know Lady D. very well.’\r\n‘And Mrs. P. and her daughters?’ said Dr. W. ‘Oh yes, I know them too.’\r\n‘And Mr. Y.?’ There was a moment’s pause, and then the young lady very\r\nnaïvely and ingenuously said, ‘Yes, I do know Mr. Y. very well; and\r\nperhaps I had better tell you something. I am going to be _married_ to\r\nhim to-morrow. My own parents are in India, and I am going to be married\r\nfrom his father’s house. Since I have been engaged to him, I have made\r\nthe acquaintance of many of his friends and neighbours, and that is how\r\nI know so many people near Oxenholme, though I have never been there\r\nbefore.’\r\n\r\n“Dr. Watson was charmed with the simple candour of the young lady. They\r\nwent on talking, and they became quite friends. The train arrived at\r\nRugby, and they both got out and had their bun in the refreshment-room.\r\nThey were in the carriage again, and the train was already moving, when,\r\nin great excitement, the young lady called out: ‘Oh stop, stop the\r\ntrain, don’t you see how he’s urging me to get out. There! that young\r\nman in the brown ulster, that’s the young man I’m going to be married\r\nto.’ Of course it was impossible to get out, and the young lady was\r\ngreatly distressed, and though Dr. Watson assured her most positively\r\nthat there was no one standing where she described, she would not and\r\ncould not believe him.\r\n\r\n“Then Dr. Watson said, ‘Now, my dear young lady, you’re very young and\r\nI’m very old. I am a doctor. I am very well known, and from what you\r\nhave been seeing I am quite sure, as a physician, that you are not at\r\nall well. Now, I have my medicine chest with me, and you had better let\r\nme give you a little dose.’ And he did give her a little dose.\r\n\r\n“The train arrived at Stafford, and exactly the same thing occurred.\r\n‘There, there! don’t you see him! _that_ young man with the light beard,\r\nin the brown ulster, don’t you see how he’s urging me to get out.’ And\r\nagain Dr. Watson assured her there was no one there, and said, ‘I think\r\nyou had better let me give you another little dose;’ and he gave her\r\nanother little dose.\r\n\r\n“But Dr. Watson naturally felt that he could not go on giving her a dose\r\nat every station all the way to Oxenholme, so he decided within himself\r\nthat if the same thing happened at Crewe, the young lady’s state\r\nindicated one of two things: either that there was some intentional\r\nvision from Providence, with which he ought not to interfere; or that\r\nthe young lady was certainly not in a state of health or brain which\r\nshould allow of her being married next day. So he determined to act\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n“And at Crewe just the same thing happened. ‘There, there! don’t you see\r\nhim! he’s urging me more than ever to get out,’ cried the young lady.\r\n‘Very well,’ said Dr. Watson, ‘we will get out and go after him,’ and,\r\nwith the young lady, he pursued the imaginary figure, and of course did\r\nnot find him. But Dr. Watson had often been at Crewe station before, and\r\nhe went to the hotel, which opens on the platform, and said to the\r\nmatron, ‘Here is this young lady, who is not at all well, and should\r\nhave a very quiet room; unfortunately I am not able to remain now to\r\nlook after her, but I will leave her in your care, and to-morrow I shall\r\nbe returning this way and will come to see how she is.’ And he slipped a\r\nfive-pound note into the woman’s hand to guarantee expenses.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Watson returned to the railway carriage. There was another young\r\nlady there, sitting in the place which the first young lady had\r\noccupied--a passenger who had arrived by one of the many lines which\r\nconverge at Crewe. With the new young lady he did not make acquaintance,\r\nhe moved his things to the other side of the carriage and devoted\r\nhimself to his book.\r\n\r\n“Three stations farther on came the shock of a frightful accident. There\r\nwas a collision. The train was telescoped, and many passengers were\r\nterribly hurt. The heavy case of instruments, which was in the rack\r\nabove the place where Dr. Watson had first been sitting, was thrown\r\nviolently to the other side of the carriage, hit the young lady upon the\r\nforehead and killed her on the spot.\r\n\r\n“It was long before the line could be sufficiently cleared for the train\r\nto pass which was sent to pick up the surviving passengers. Many hours\r\nlate, in the middle of the night, Dr. Watson arrived at Oxenholme.\r\nThere, waiting upon the platform, stood the young man with the light\r\nbeard, in the brown ulster, exactly as he had been described. He had\r\nheard that the only young lady in the through carriage from London had\r\nbeen killed, and was only waiting for the worst to be confirmed. And\r\nDr. Watson was the person who went up to him and said: ‘Unfortunately it\r\nis too true that a young lady has been killed, but it is not your young\r\nlady. Your young lady is safe in the station hotel at Crewe.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, May 3._--I have had a visit from the people who formerly\r\nlived here, so surprised at the changes--at the continuation of the walk\r\nin the firwood, &c., but most at the number of pictures and books\r\neverywhere inside the house, a clothing of walls which they evidently\r\nthought most unsuitable in a dining-room and passages, and most of all\r\nwere they rather shocked at finding an ancient Madonna and Child of the\r\nLuca della Robbia school over the kitchen fireplace, though in an\r\nItalian house you might almost expect one there.\r\n\r\n“I have nothing else interesting to tell you, so I will send you some\r\nscraps from my notebook. Lord Brownlow, at a public meeting, heard a\r\nschoolmaster say--‘Education is that which enables you to despise the\r\nopinions of others, and conduces to situations of considerable\r\nemolument.’ Miss Cobbe told me--‘Conscience is that which supplies you\r\nwith an excellent motive for doing that which you desire to do, and\r\nwhich, when it is done, leaves you filled with self-satisfaction.’\r\n\r\n“Mrs. L. (who has plantations in South America) has been telling me of a\r\nnigger preacher there who said in the pulpit, ‘I am so blind I cannot\r\nsee; I’ve left my specs at home,’ and all the congregation thought he\r\nwas giving out the line of a hymn, and sung it lustily.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE FIR-WOOD, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DINING-ROOM FIREPLACE, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 13, 1879, 34 Jermyn Street, London._--This morning I went with\r\nMrs. Duncan Stewart and a very large party to Whistler’s studio--a huge\r\nplace in Chelsea. We were invited to see his pictures, but there was\r\nonly one there--‘The Loves of the Lobsters.’ It was supposed to\r\nrepresent Niagara, but looked as if the artist had upset the inkstand\r\nand left Providence to work out its own results. In the midst of the\r\nblack chaos were two lobsters curvetting opposite each other and looking\r\nas if they were done with red sealing-wax. ‘I wonder you did not paint\r\nthe lobsters making love before they were boiled,’ aptly observed a\r\nlady visitor. ‘Oh, I never thought of that,’ said Whistler! It was a\r\njoke, I suppose. The little man, with his plume of white hair (‘the\r\nWhistler tuft,’ he calls it) waving on his forehead, frisked about the\r\nroom looking most strange and uncanny, and rather diverted himself over\r\nour disappointment in coming so far and finding nothing to see. People\r\nadmire like sheep his pictures in the Grosvenor Gallery, following each\r\nother’s lead because it is the fashion.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 14, Sunday._--An immense luncheon at Mrs. Cavendish Bentinck’s. I\r\nsat near Mr. Herbert, the artist of the great fresco in the House of\r\nLords. He described things over which he became almost inspired--how in\r\nthe Bodleian he found an old MS. about the Magdalen which made him\r\ndetermine to go off at once to St. Maximin in Provence (near La Sainte\r\nBaume, the mountain hermitage where she died) to see her skull: that\r\nwhen he reached St. Maximin, he found that the skull was in a glass case\r\nupon the altar, where he could not really examine it, and he was told\r\nthat it was never allowed even to kings and emperors: that he\r\nrepresented with such fervour his object in making the pilgrimage, that\r\nat last the priests of the church consented to his sending twelve miles\r\nfor a _vitrier_ and having the case removed: then he was allowed to\r\nplace a single candle behind, and in that moment, as he described it,\r\nwith glowing face and voice trembling with emotion--‘I saw the outline\r\nof her profile; the Magdalen herself, that dear friend of our Blessed\r\nLord, was revealed to me.’\r\n\r\n“Miss Leslie, who was sitting near, asked how it was known that the\r\nMagdalen came to St. Maximin. ‘How can you help knowing it,’ said Mr.\r\nHerbert, ‘when it is all written in the Acts of the Apostles!!’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA SAINTE BAUME.][303]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 15._--Dined with Lord and Lady Aberdeen--a very large party,\r\nseventy-four pots of flowers upon the table.

Even at such a solemn\r\ntime one could not help smiling at his characteristic _last\r\nwords_--‘Present my duty to the Princess Amalie’ (of\r\nSchleswig-Holstein).[304]\r\n\r\n“At luncheon at Lady Florentia Hughes’s I met George Russell, who told\r\nme a story which Lord and Lady Portsmouth had just brought back from\r\nDevonshire.\r\n\r\n“‘On the railway which runs from Exeter to Barnstaple is a small station\r\ncalled Lapford. A farmer who lives in a farmhouse near that station\r\nawoke his wife one night, saying that he had had a very vivid dream\r\nwhich troubled him--that a very valuable cow of his had fallen into a\r\npit and could not get out again. The wife laughed, and he went to sleep\r\nand dreamt the same thing. Then he wanted to go and look after the cow.\r\nBut the wife urged the piercing cold of the winter night, and he went to\r\nsleep instead, and dreamt the same thing a third time. Then he insisted\r\nupon getting up, and, resisting his wife’s entreaties, he went out to\r\nlook after the cow. It was with a sense of bathos that he found the cow\r\nquite well and grazing quietly, and he was thinking how his wife would\r\nlaugh at him when he got home, and wondering what he should say to her,\r\nwhen he was aware of a light in the next field. Crawling very quietly to\r\nthe hedge, he saw, through the leafless branches of the hawthorns, a man\r\nwith a lanthorn and a spade, apparently digging a pit. As he was\r\nwatching, he stumbled in the ditch and the branches crackled. The man,\r\nhearing a noise, started, threw down the spade, and ran off with the\r\nlanthorn.\r\n\r\n“‘The farmer then made his way round into the next field and came up to\r\nthe place where the man had been digging. It was a long narrow pit like\r\nan open grave. At first he could make nothing of it, then by the side of\r\nthe pit he found a large open knife. He took that and the spade, and\r\nbegan to set out homewards, but, with an indescribable shrinking from\r\nthe more desolate _feeling_ of the fields, he went round by the lane. He\r\nhad not gone far before he heard footsteps coming towards him. It was\r\ntwo o’clock in the morning, and his nerves being quite unstrung, he\r\nshrank from meeting whoever it was, and climbed up into the hedge to\r\nconceal himself. To his astonishment, he saw pass below him in the\r\nmoonlit road one of the maids of his own farmhouse. He allowed her to\r\npass, and then sprang out and seized her. She was most dreadfully\r\nfrightened. He demanded to know what she was there for. She tried to\r\nmake some excuse. “Oh,” he said, “there can be no possible excuse; I\r\ninsist upon knowing the truth.” She then said, “You know I was engaged\r\nto be married, and that I had a dreadful quarrel with the man I was\r\nengaged to, and it was broken off. Well, yesterday he let me know that\r\nif I would meet him in the middle of the night, he had got something to\r\nshow me which would make up for all the past.”--“Would you like to know\r\nwhat he had to show you? It was your grave he had to show you,” said the\r\nfarmer, and he led her to the edge of the pit and showed it to her.\r\n\r\n“‘The farmer’s dream had saved the woman’s life.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 19._--The Prince (of Sweden and Norway) has arrived with his suite\r\nat Claridge’s.

I\r\npresented so many relations to the Prince that he said that which\r\nastonished him more than anything else in England was ‘the multitude of\r\nMr. Hare’s cousins.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 30._--With the Prince to Westminster Abbey, after which Arthur met\r\nus in the Jerusalem Chamber and took us into the Deanery. In the evening\r\nwith the Prince to Lady Margaret Beaumont’s.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 6._--With the Prince Royal to the Academy.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 7._--To the National Gallery with the Prince.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE JERUSALEM CHAMBER.][305]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 8._--Luncheon with the Prince. We drove afterwards to see Lady\r\nRussell. Pembroke Lodge looked enchanting with its bright green of old\r\noaks and its carpet of bluebells--a most perfect refuge for the latter\r\nyears of an aged statesman. Lady Russell was waiting for us at the\r\nentrance, with Lady Agatha and Rollo. On the lawn we found many other\r\nmembers of the family, with Mr. Bouverie and Mr. Froude the historian. I\r\npresented them all, and we walked in the grounds. At tea Lord Bute came\r\nin from a neighbouring villa--always most pleasant and cordial to me.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 11._--Dined with old Lady Harrington, and left as early as I\r\ncould to go to Mrs. Schuster’s, where Sarah Bernhardt was to act. She\r\nappeared first in the great scene of the ‘Phédre’--her face bloodless,\r\nher arms rigid, her voice monotonous and broken. Gradually, under the\r\ninfluence of her love, she became animated, but the animation began at\r\nthe tips of her fingers, till it burst all over her in a flood of\r\nirrepressible passion.\r\n\r\n“She did not seem to see her audience or to think of them. For the time\r\nbeing she was _only_ her part, and, when it was over, she sank down\r\nutterly exhausted, almost unconscious.\r\n\r\n“She appeared again in a small part, in which she was a great lady\r\nturned sculptress. The part was nothing; she had little more to say than\r\n‘Let me see more of your profile; turn a little more the other way;’ yet\r\nthe great simplicity of her perfect acting made it deeply interesting,\r\nand, in the quarter of an hour in which the scene lasted, she had done\r\nin the clay a real medallion which was a striking likeness.”[306]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 12._--Dined with Madame du Quaire--her table like a glorious Van\r\nHuysum picture from the fruit and flower piece in the centre. The\r\nhostess is famous for the warmth and steadfastness of her friendships.\r\nMrs. Stewart says--‘Fanny du Quaire is the only person I know who would\r\ndo _anything_ for her friends. If it were necessary for my peace that I\r\nshould have poison, I should send for Fanny du Quaire, and she would\r\ngive it me without flinching.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 13._--Dined at Sir Charles Trevelyan’s. I took down a lady whose\r\nname seemed to be ‘Mrs. Beckett.’ I did not interest her, and she talked\r\nexclusively to Lord O’Hagan, who was on the other side of her. Towards\r\nthe close of dinner she said to me, ‘We have been a very long time at\r\ndinner.’--‘To me it has seemed quite endless,’ I said.--‘Well,’ she\r\nexclaimed, ‘I do not wonder that you were chosen to speak truth to\r\nPrinces.’\r\n\r\n“I asked her how she knew anything about that, and she said, ‘I have\r\nlived a long time in a court atmosphere myself. I was for twelve years\r\nwith the late Queen of Holland.’--‘Oh,’ I said, ‘_now_ I know who you\r\nare; you are Mrs. Lecky!’ and it was the well-known author’s wife.”[307]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 14._--Luncheon with Lady Darnley, and a long quiet talk with her\r\nafterwards, then a visit to young Lord Lansdowne in his cool, pleasant\r\nrooms looking upon the garden.\r\n\r\n“Dined with Count Piper, the Swedish Minister,[308] to meet the Prince\r\nRoyal. I sat by Madame de Bülow, who is always pleasant. The only other\r\nlady unconnected with the Embassy was Mademoiselle Christine Nilsson,\r\nwho sang most beautifully afterwards till Jenny Lind arrived. Then the\r\nrivalry of the two queens of song became most curious, Nilsson planting\r\nherself at the end of the pianoforte with her arms akimbo, and crying\r\nsatirical bravas during Jenny’s songs, and Jenny avenging herself by\r\nnever allowing Nilsson to return to the pianoforte at all. The party was\r\na very late one, and supper was served, when the Prince offered Jenny\r\nhis arm to take her down. She accepted it, though with great diffidence;\r\nwhich so exasperated Nilsson, that with ‘Je m’en vais donc,’ utterly\r\nrefusing to be pacified, she swept out of the room and out of the house,\r\nthough how she got away I do not know.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 15._--A quiet luncheon with Lady Reay. Afterwards to Mrs. Duncan\r\nStewart, who told me:--\r\n\r\n“‘A great friend of mine was living lately in Brittany, and, while\r\nthere, made acquaintance with a lady and her daughter who were staying\r\nin the same place--the mother a commonplace woman, the daughter a\r\npleasant interesting girl.\r\n\r\n“‘A short time after, the mother and daughter came to England, and my\r\nfriend, who was in very delicate health at the time, invited them to\r\nvisit her. The mother was prevented coming at first, but sent her\r\ndaughter and said that she would follow.\r\n\r\n“‘One day my friend was sitting in her boudoir, of which the door was\r\najar, very little open. The girl had gone to her own room, which was\r\nimmediately above the boudoir, saying that she had letters to write.\r\n\r\n“‘Suddenly my friend was aware that _something_ was coming in at the\r\ndoor, not pushing it wider open, but gliding through the opening which\r\nalready existed, and, to her horror, she saw, perfectly naked,\r\npropelling herself serpent-like upon her belly, with her hair rising\r\nlike a crest over her head, and her eyes, without any speculation in\r\nthem, staring wide open, the figure of a young girl, whom she recognised\r\nas her guest.\r\n\r\n“‘With snake-like motion the girl glided in and out of the furniture,\r\nunder the chairs, sofas, &c., but touching nothing, and with her eyes\r\nconstantly fixed upon my friend, with an expression which was rather\r\nthat of fear than anything else. At length she glided out of the room as\r\nshe came in.\r\n\r\n“‘As soon as my friend could recover herself a little, she pursued the\r\ngirl to her room and quietly opened the door. To her horror, all the\r\narticles of crockery in the room, jug, basin, &c., were dispersed about\r\nthe floor at regular intervals and in a regular pattern, and through\r\nthem all, in and out, without touching them, the girl was gliding,\r\nsnake-like, with her head erect, and her vacant eyes staring.\r\n\r\n“‘My friend fled to her room and began to think what she should do; but\r\nsuch was her horror that she thinks she fainted; at any rate the power\r\nof action seemed to fail her. When she could move, she thought it her\r\nduty to go up to the girl’s room again, and perhaps was almost more\r\nhorrified than before to find the room in perfect order and the girl\r\nseated dressed at the table, writing. She sent for the girl’s mother,\r\nwho was terribly distressed. She allowed that her daughter had had these\r\nutterly inexplicable attacks before, but long ago, and she had hoped\r\nthat she was cured of them.’\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Stewart told this story to Mr. Fergusson the great naturalist, who\r\nonly said, ‘I am not the least surprised: there is nothing extraordinary\r\nin it. There have been many other instances of the serpent element\r\ncoming out in people.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 16._--Met the Prince early at Paddington, whence we had a saloon\r\ncarriage to Oxford, with Sir Watkin Wynne as director to watch over us.\r\nWe went a whole round of colleges and to the Bodleian, where Mr. Coxe\r\nexhibited his treasures. Then the Prince wished to see the boats, so we\r\nwalked down to the river. Just before us I saw an undergraduate in\r\nboating costume and ran after him.\r\n\r\n“‘Can you take us on board the University barge?’\r\n\r\n“‘No-o-o-o, I think not.’\r\n\r\n“‘But my companion is the Prince Royal of Sweden and Norway.’\r\n\r\n“Upon which the boy very soon found that he could take a Prince\r\nanywhere, and proud he probably was afterwards to narrate to whom he had\r\nbeen acting cicerone. In the barge, a number of undergraduates were\r\nlooking at the Prince’s portrait in the _Graphic_. He looked at it too,\r\nover their shoulders, but they did not recognise him.\r\n\r\n“It was a fatiguing day, and I felt greatly the utter apathy and want of\r\ninterest in all the Swedes, who scarcely noticed anything, admired\r\nnothing, and remembered nothing.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 18._--Again to Oxford with the Prince. This time the town was in\r\ngala costume, and we drove through a street hung with flags, and through\r\ncrowds of people waiting to see the Prince, to the Vice-Chancellor’s\r\nLodge at Pembroke. Here the Prince dressed, and I went on at once with\r\nhis gentlemen to the Theatre, where places were reserved for us just\r\nunder the Vice-Chancellor’s throne. My Swedish companions were amused\r\nwith the undergraduates’ expression of their likes and dislikes, till\r\nthe great moment came and the great doors were thrown open, and, amid a\r\nflood of sunlight, the procession streamed in headed by all the gold\r\nmaces. Immediately after the Vice-Chancellor came my Prince, looking\r\ntall and handsome in his white uniform with the crimson robe over it,\r\nand perfectly royal. _I_ knew that he felt nervous, but he could not\r\nhave been half as nervous as I was. He played his part, however,\r\nperfectly. He received his degree standing by the Vice-Chancellor’s\r\nside, and the whole body of undergraduates sang a little impromptu song,\r\nto the effect of ‘He’s a charming Swedish boy.’\r\n\r\n“We adjourned from the Theatre to the green court of All Souls, where,\r\nin the sunlit quadrangle, I brought up, one after another, all the\r\nprincipal persons to be presented to the Prince--Lord and Lady Dufferin,\r\nRachel and Sir Arthur Gordon, Lord Selborne, the Dean of Christ Church\r\nand Mrs. Liddell, &c. There was a luncheon for 300 in the All-Souls\r\nlibrary, and afterwards we drove with Mrs. Evans, the Vice-Chancellor’s\r\nwife, to the Masonic fête in the lovely Wadham garden, and then paid\r\nofficial visits, before leaving, to the Vice-Chancellor and Dean.\r\n\r\n“In the evening I was with the Prince at Mrs. E. Guiness’s ball, on\r\nwhich £6000 are said to have been wasted. It was a perfect fairy-land,\r\nice pillars up to the ceiling, an avenue of palms, a veil of stephanotis\r\nfrom the staircase, and you pushed your way through a brake of papyrus\r\nto the cloak-room.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 19._--We dined with the Aberdeens. I went before the Prince, and\r\nwas with Aberdeen to receive him at the door, and then presented a\r\nquantity of people--Lord and Lady Carnarvon, Lord and Lady Brownlow,\r\nLady Balfour, Dowager Lady Aberdeen, &c. The London Scottish Volunteers\r\nplayed soft music during dinner. Soon afterwards the Prince went away to\r\nthe Scandinavian ball, rather disappointing many people who came to see\r\nhim in the evening.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 20._--Oh, what a shock it has been that, while the balls last\r\nnight were going on, telegrams announced the death of the dear young\r\nPrince Imperial! I am sure I cried for him like a nearest relation;\r\nthere was something so very cordial and attaching in him, and there is\r\nsomething so unspeakably terrible in his death. The Prince was\r\noverwhelmed, and could not dine at Lowther Lodge, where there was a\r\nlarge party expressly to meet him, but he was quite right.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 21._--We can think of nothing else but the Prince Imperial and\r\nthe awful grief at Chislehurst. Immediately on hearing the telegram,\r\nLord Dorchester wrote to M. Pietri a letter of condolence. M. Pietri was\r\naway in Corsica, and the Empress opened his letter. It begged Pietri to\r\noffer deep sympathy to the Empress in her overwhelming affliction. She\r\nfelt her son was dead, and when Lord Sydney and Mr. Borthwick arrived,\r\nthey found her in tears; but when she heard the awful truth that her\r\ndarling had been deserted and assegaied, she gave terrible shrieks and\r\nfainted away.\r\n\r\n“Most of the day she was unconscious. Those who went to Chislehurst\r\ndescribe the scene as too heart-rending. The old servants could not\r\nrest, and walked in the garden in groups, wringing their hands and\r\ncrying ‘O mon pauvre petit Prince! O mon pauvre cher petit Prince!’\r\n\r\n“In the morning I went with the Prince to Lambeth,--all of us very sad\r\nand tearful. I had mentioned a rather later hour to the Archbishop, so\r\nthat he was not ready to receive us, and Lord and Lady Charles Clinton,\r\nwho were there, were dreadfully shy. When the Archbishop came, he showed\r\nus his library treasures, and climbed up the high Lollards’ Tower to\r\ntake the Prince to the prison of the early Reformers; but I felt how\r\nfearfully dull the Archbishop must think all the Swedes, who made no\r\nobservation whatever upon anything they saw.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 23._--With the Prince to the Rose and Crown Coffee-House. Lord\r\nand Lady Aberdeen and Lady Cairns met us there. It is a beautifully\r\nmanaged institution, and fresh and clean to a degree. All the workmen\r\ncrowded in for dinner before we left, but I would not let Aberdeen let\r\nthem know who was there till the last moment, when the news gave great\r\nsatisfaction; but they behaved beautifully--no crowding or staring: the\r\nPrince wrote his name in their book.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LOLLARDS’ PRISON, LAMBETH.][309]\r\n\r\n“Luncheon afterwards with Lord and Lady Garvagh, meeting only Madame\r\nRouzaud (Christine Nilsson).”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 25._--Dinner at Lord Sandwich’s--a particularly good party. I sat\r\nby Lady Elcho, whose mind seems to be in perpetual moonlight, very\r\ncalming and refreshing.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WAKEFIELD TOWER, TOWER OF LONDON.][310]\r\n\r\n“_June 26._--To the Tower of London with the Prince, who was very\r\ngood-humoured and absurd. It is a long fatiguing sight. Our being at\r\nTrinity Square was curious in its results, as persons were just then\r\nvisiting it (the site of the block at which More, Fisher, Laud,\r\nStrafford fell) with a view to its destruction, and the fact, afterwards\r\nadduced before the House of Lords, that the Prince Royal of Sweden and\r\nNorway was at that very moment being taken to see it as one of the great\r\nhistorical sites of London, proved its salvation.\r\n\r\n“How wearisome it is to steer the Prince through people’s little\r\nintrigues. They have to-day involved a letter of six sheets to the Queen\r\nof Sweden. Yesterday I was free, as he went with the ‘Four-in-Hand\r\nClub,’--an odd arrangement for _me_ to have to make for him.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 27._--Went with the Prince by appointment to Hertford House,\r\nwhere Sir R. Wallace received us. His riches are untold and\r\nindescribable. He showed them very pleasantly, and had much that was\r\ninteresting to tell about them.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 3._--To Syon with the Lockers and Leslies. So few people came at\r\nfirst, owing to the wet, that we were most cordially welcomed by the\r\nDuke and Lady Percy. Soon it cleared and half London began to pour in;\r\nbut the long wide galleries never seem crowded. I reached the\r\nconservatories with Mary and Lily Hughes, and the gardener showed us\r\nsome bamboos which, he said, grew twelve inches a day!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 4._--Oh, the constant variety of the tangle of London life! This\r\nmorning was occupied by a special farewell service in Henry VII.’s\r\nchapel at Westminster for Arthur Gordon and Victor Williamson going out\r\nto Fiji. Arthur Stanley preached, standing behind the altar over Edward\r\nVI.’s grave, a most pagan little sermon about Alexander and Priam and\r\nthe sacred fire of Troy as a comfort to wandering souls! We all received\r\nthe Sacrament together, and then took leave of the travellers in the\r\nChapter-House.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 5._--A reprieve from duties to the Prince, who has gone to\r\nWindsor and Aldershot. I had the great happiness of seeing Lady\r\nCastletown and Mrs. Lewis Wingfield again after four years. It is\r\ndelightful to see any one who ‘knows how’ to enjoy themselves: every one\r\nwishes it, but scarcely any one has an idea how it is to be done.\r\n\r\n“At dinner at Sir Rutherford Alcock’s I heard the startling news of the\r\ndeath of Frances, Lady Waldegrave.[311] To me she was only a lay figure,\r\nreceiving at her drawing-room door, but I remember her thus ever since I\r\nwas a boy at Oxford, when she was living at Nuneham. In spite of her\r\nfaults, she had many and warm friends: Lord Houghton sobbed like a child\r\non receiving the news in the midst of a large party. News which affected\r\nme more personally was the death of dear young Charlie Ossulston[312]\r\nfrom cholera in India.... I heard it at the Speaker’s party, which was\r\nmost beautiful, with windows wide open to the river in the glory of full\r\nmoonlight, with which the many lamp-reflections were vainly contending,\r\ngold against silver, upon the wavelets.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sunday, July 6._--To Bedford Chapel to hear Mr. Stopford Brooke preach\r\non the world as an arena and men as gladiators. ‘But who are the\r\nwitnesses on the encircling seats?’ These he described, from dwellers\r\nin the present life to a crowd, such as that painted ‘by artists of\r\nillimitable ideas but limited powers,’ of the glorious army of apostles,\r\nconfessors, and martyrs, who all diverge from Christ as a centre.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 10._--A charming party at Syon, where I walked about with dear\r\nold Lady Barrington. A very pleasant dinner at Lord Brownlow’s, where\r\nwas a whole succession of beautiful ladies--the lovely hostess herself,\r\nLady Pembroke, Lady Lothian, Lady de Vesci, Lady Wharncliffe, Mrs.\r\nReginald Talbot, &c. These high-bred beauties are indeed a contrast to\r\nthose known as the ‘professional beauties.’ Most exquisite singing in\r\nthe evening, then a party at the Duchess of Cleveland’s to meet the Duke\r\nand Duchess of Edinburgh.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 11._--Dined at Sir Dudley Marjoribanks’--Brook House a beautiful\r\ninterior with marvellous china. There was such a procession of Earls and\r\nCountesses, that it fell to my share to take Mrs. Gladstone in to\r\ndinner. Disraeli had said to her, ‘Now _do_ take care of Mr. Gladstone;\r\nyou know he is _so_ precious.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 12._--The dear Prince Imperial’s funeral. I was very sorry not to\r\ngo, but my Prince evidently thought I could not, having known him so\r\nwell and yet having no recognised place.\r\n\r\n“Our whole hearts are with the Empress. How many instances there have\r\nbeen of her perfectly noble character since she has been in England.\r\nNone are more striking than that which regarded M. Guizot. He had hated\r\nthe Imperial government, he had reviled the Emperor: there was no ill\r\nwhich he did not wish him. But his youngest son, Guillaume, got into\r\nserious money troubles, and eventually he borrowed a large sum--£4000 it\r\nis said--from the Emperor. It was concealed from his father. Long, very\r\nlong afterwards, when the Emperor was dead, M. Guizot found it out. It\r\nwas agony to him. It was most difficult to him to pay the money, but he\r\ndetermined to do it at any sacrifice, and he wrote to tell the Empress\r\nso. The Empress answered by telegraph--‘L’Impératrice donne, mais elle\r\nne prête pas.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 15._--Lady Ashburton had asked the Hereditary Grand Duke of Baden\r\nto dinner as well as my Prince, so I went to help her by acting Master\r\nof the Ceremonies and receiving the royalties in the hall of Kent House.\r\nWhile I was waiting, watching at the window, a fair young man arrived\r\nunattended and ran upstairs. I took no notice of _him_. Then I received\r\nthe Prince Royal properly, escorted him as far as Lady Ashburton’s\r\ncurtsies, and came back to wait for the young Grand Duke. At last Lady\r\nAshburton sent down to tell me he was _there_, had been there the whole\r\ntime: he was the young man who ran upstairs.\r\n\r\n“I had much talk with him afterwards--a tall, simple, pleasing-mannered\r\nyouth, much more responsive than my Prince, and good-looking, though\r\nvery German in appearance. There were glees at dinner, sung in the\r\nanteroom, and a large party and concert in the evening.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 16._--A beautiful party at Holland House. There was quite a mass\r\nof royalty on the lawn--the Prince and Princess of Wales and their\r\nlittle girls (in pink trimmed with red), the Edinburghs, the Connaughts,\r\nthe Tecks, with their little girl and two nice boys in sailor’s dress,\r\nthe Duchess of Mecklenbourg, the Prince of Baden, and my Prince. The\r\nroyal children were all in raptures over some performing dogs, which\r\nreally were very funny, as a handsome Spitz looked so ecstatically\r\ndelighted to ride about on the lawn on a barrel pushed by a number of\r\nother dogs.\r\n\r\n“Dined at Lord Muncaster’s, where I sat by Lady Cairns and Mrs. Cross,\r\nboth worth listening to. The Muncasters, by M. Henri’s aid, have given\r\nquite an old Flemish interior to a handsome commonplace house in Carlton\r\nGardens.\r\n\r\n“A concert afterwards at Lady Brownlow’s--all the three beautiful\r\nsisters were there, and most lovely in their different phases.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 18._--Luncheon with young Lady Morley and dinner with her\r\nmother-in-law, then to a concert at Stafford House. The Duchess (of\r\nSutherland) talked much and affectionately of my sister, whom so few\r\nremember now. The Spanish Students were ranged with their instruments on\r\nthe broad landing of the staircase, and the whole scene was like that\r\nof the play of ‘Hamlet.’ The Prince of Wales walked about and talked,\r\nwinning good opinions by the attention with which he always seems to\r\nlisten to whoever is speaking to him.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 19._--Went down with the special train to Hatfield, and drove up\r\nfrom the station to the house with old Lady Ailesbury. An immense party\r\nof Dukes and Duchesses, &c., were already collected to welcome the\r\nroyalties, Lady Salisbury receiving them in a large rough straw\r\ngarden-bonnet. The Hereditary Grand Duke of Baden arrived early, and I\r\nwas sent off with him to see the old Elizabethan buildings, the stables,\r\n&c. He is extremely pleasing, responsive, and conversable, and his\r\nadmiration of the place was most intense and natural. I walked about\r\nwith different friends till the royal party drove up in six carriages.\r\nThey were all going to stay at Hatfield till Monday, fifty people,\r\nbesides servants. I came back at eight.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 21._--Met the Prince Royal at Waterloo Station, where a great\r\nmany people were collected to see him off. Lady Marian Alford joined us,\r\nand we floated into Hampshire in a royal saloon carriage. I went to my\r\nPrince in the little private compartment, and had a long talk with him,\r\nin which all the growing mists of the London season seemed to be swept\r\naway at once, and our intimate trust and affection for each other\r\nrestored upon its old footing.\r\n\r\n“Carriages from Lady Waterford met us at Holmsley, and we had a\r\npleasant but rather cold drive through the forest. In the gothic porch\r\nof Highcliffe, Lady Waterford was waiting with Mr. and Lady Jane Ellice,\r\nand Miss Lindsay. Alwyn Greville came in the evening, and a few people\r\nto dinner. The ladies sang, Miss Lindsay recited, and the Prince also\r\nsang a little.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 22._--A misty day, but still, and Highcliffe delightful.\r\n\r\n“The King had said so much to the Prince about Lady Waterford, that he\r\nis at his very best here, and he has had well-worth-while conversation\r\nwith Lady Marian. We drove with Colonel Thursby’s four-in-hand to Herne\r\nPark, and in the afternoon looked for fossils on the cliffs, where M. de\r\nPrintzsköld sank up to his knees in a bog of black mud. In the evening\r\nthere was a little ball, opened by the dear Lady herself with the\r\nPrince.... The Prince was enchanted with everything, and said he would\r\nrather sit by either of ‘the three ladies’ at Highcliffe[313] than by\r\nthe most beautiful young lady in England.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 23._--The Prince was so anxious that I should go with him to\r\nDevonshire that I consented to leave Highcliffe with him after\r\nbreakfast. We had a pleasant journey through the rich Somersetshire\r\norchards, and during a wait at Templecombe, a ramble with the Prince to\r\nthe church. We have met the Swedish equerries again, and life is not\r\nalways quite as easy as it has been without them: however, though we\r\nhave our ups and downs, we have also our downs and ups, and ‘si gravis,\r\nbrevis,’ is a proverb one can always remember.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 24._--Torbay is bluer than I ever saw the Bay of Naples, and the\r\nsun shines on the red rocks of Paignton and the white sails flitting\r\nover the limpid water. My windows look into the grounds of Rockend--the\r\nsteep field, the little wood, the very windows of the house connected\r\nwith many of the miseries of my childhood.[314] I have wandered on the\r\nterraces--to the rock walk; the seat where I used to see Uncle Julius\r\nand Aunt Esther sitting in the first year of their marriage; ‘Cummany’s\r\nCorner,’ where ladies-finger and coronilla grow still; the tower where\r\nAunt Lucy used to meditate and pray. Almost all the friends--and enemies\r\ntoo--of my childhood have passed away now, and it is in places like this\r\nwhich recall them so vividly, that I feel the longing Webster describes\r\nin the ‘Duchess of Melfi’:--\r\n\r\n            “‘O that it were possible we might\r\n    But hold some two days’ conference with the dead!\r\n    From them I should learn something I am sure\r\n    I never shall learn here.’”\r\n\r\n“_July 26._--I took leave of the Prince in his bedroom before he was\r\ndressed. Our real separation must come soon; and though in many ways I\r\nshall feel wonderfully set free when my responsibility is over, my heart\r\nalways yearns toward him.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Lyme Hall, August 6._--After two days at Thornycroft in familiar\r\nscenes, I have come to Lyme to receive the Prince Royal. Only Mr. and\r\nMrs. Davenport are here, with their pretty daughter, engaged to marry\r\nTom Legh.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 7._--The Prince arrived from Manchester. I went to receive him\r\nat Disley Station and to present Mr. Legh, who had never seen him\r\nbefore. James II.’s rooms were prepared for him.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 8._--I sat out much of the day with Mrs. Legh, while the Prince\r\nplayed at lawn-tennis, and in the afternoon I drove with Mrs. Legh and\r\nMrs. Davenport along the hills and moor, while he rode with the others.\r\nHe is much delighted with the great Lyme dogs, and is to have one of\r\nthem; to his great disappointment the wild cattle have almost ceased to\r\nexist. He will only be interested in facts, never in vision or its\r\nemotions, and it is no use to tell him that--\r\n\r\n    “‘Man’s books are but man’s alphabet,\r\n        Beyond and on his lessons lie--\r\n      The lessons of the violet,\r\n        The large gold letters of the sky:\r\n      The love of beauty, blossomed soil,\r\n      The large content, the tranquil toil.’”[315]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 9._--Left Lyme with the Prince and the Davenports in a saloon\r\ncarriage to Crewe. I sat alone with the Prince most of the time in the\r\ninner compartment. We parted at Crewe intending to meet again in three\r\ndays’ time.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Betton House, August 10._--With the dear old Tayleurs. To church at\r\nMucklestone, and afterwards to Mr. Hinchcliffe’s charming vicarage\r\ngarden. From the church tower Margaret of Anjou watched the battle of\r\nBlore Heath, and in the village the same family (with the same name)\r\nstill officiate as blacksmiths, one of whose members shoed the Queen’s\r\nhorse backwards to be ready for her escape if it was needed, and thus\r\nsaved her.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 11._--To Buntingsdale, beautiful as in childish\r\nremembrance,[316] with the real scent of the lime-trees, which has often\r\ncome back to me in dreams.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Glamis Castle, August 13._--I arrived at Glamis at 9 P.M., and found\r\nan immense party in the house--Sir James and Lady Ramsay, Lord and (the\r\nvery charming) Lady Sydney Inverurie, Lord and Lady Northesk, and many\r\nothers. Lord Strathmore has made great preparations, and the Prince\r\nwould have had the most royal reception here which he has met with\r\nanywhere; but, to the great inconvenience of every one, he has put off\r\nleaving Hopetoun, where he is, being ill with toothache.\r\n\r\n“I have been sitting out much with Lady Sydney Inverurie, who went for\r\nher wedding tour to--Japan! She is most amusing about her children and\r\nthe agony they keep her in as to how to answer their questions. One had\r\njust asked her ‘Who cut God’s hair?’ and upon her describing the events\r\nof Eden, asked why Adam and Eve did not climb over the walls and get out\r\nthe other way, because the angel could not come after them, as God had\r\ncommanded him to _stay_ at the gate.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 15._--I have greatly enjoyed this visit at Glamis, and am glad\r\nto feel the cousinly tie drawn closer to the Lyon boys individually as\r\nwell as collectively. Miss Macdonald was very amusing in her stories.\r\n\r\n“A Bishop (Wilberforce of course) remonstrated with a country curate in\r\nhis diocese for driving tandem. The curate said, ‘Well, my Lord, I\r\ncannot see that there is more harm in my driving my horses before each\r\nother than in my driving them side by side.’ ‘Oh, yes,’ said the Bishop,\r\n‘there really is a fitness in things; for example, if I put my hands so\r\n(folding them together), no one can reproach me, but if I put them _so_\r\n(cutting a snooks), they might reproach me very much indeed.’\r\n\r\n“In the winter the Duchess of Leinster had a large Christmas party for\r\nher servants, and took particular pains to make it agreeable for them.\r\nAfterwards she asked her old housekeeper how she had enjoyed it. ‘Oh,\r\nyour Grace, I should have enjoyed it very much indeed, if something most\r\ndreadful had not happened, which has made me perfectly\r\nmiserable.’--‘What can it have been?’ said the Duchess. ‘Oh, it was\r\nsomething so dreadful, I really cannot tell your Grace: I was so\r\ndreadfully insulted by the butler, I really cannot repeat his\r\nwords.’--‘Oh, but you really must,’ said the Duchess. ‘Well, your Grace,\r\nif I really must, I must tell your Grace that I was coming out from\r\nsupper, and I had only had the wing of a pheasant and a little bit of\r\njelly, and I met the butler, and he said to me “Is your programme\r\n_full_?” Now your Grace will allow that _that_ was so insulting that\r\npleasure was not to be thought of afterwards.’\r\n\r\n“Miss Erica Robertson said:--\r\n\r\n“‘Bishop Wilberforce was going, in a visitation tour, to stay at a very\r\nhumble clergyman’s house. The maid was instructed that, if he spoke to\r\nher, she was never to answer him without saying “My Lord.” When the\r\nBishop had written his letters, he asked who would take them to the\r\npost. “The Lord, my boy,” said the terrified maid.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 24._--I left Glamis on Monday, and went by Dalmally to Oban\r\nthrough the Brender Pass--beautiful exceedingly, the mountains so varied\r\nand encircling such varied waters.\r\n\r\n“On Thursday, at dawn, I saw all the mountains meeting their shadows in\r\nthe still waters of Oban Bay, and determined to go to Staffa. It was a\r\ncrowded, rolling, smelly steamer, and I was very miserable, but rather\r\nbetter than worse when the fresh air in the Atlantic made up for the\r\nadditional rolling. At twelve we reached Iona--different from what I\r\nexpected, the island larger and the ruins smaller, and without the\r\nromantic effect of those on Holy Island. Still, of course, the interest\r\nis intense of the cradle of Scottish Christianity, the Throndtjem of\r\nScotland. I found some pleasant boys, sons of a Glasgow merchant,\r\nsketching, and made great friends with them. An agony of Atlantic swell\r\nbrought us to Staffa, but oh! how grand it is!--the grandest cathedral\r\nof nature, black with age and roofed with golden vegetation, rising out\r\nof the blue sea and lashed by the white foam. I drew a little on the\r\nbasaltic columns opposite Fingal’s Cave, whilst the mass of the\r\npassengers were landing and scrambling about the cavern, and then my boy\r\nfriends and I climbed the long staircases to the top, where the breezy\r\ndowns are enamelled with flowers, and the view is most sublime--of the\r\nAtlantic, the islands in their fantastic shapes, the distant ghost of\r\nshadowy mountains in Skye, and the turbulent waves beneath. I never saw\r\nany single place which makes such an impression of natural sublimity.\r\n\r\n“How the interests and emotions of life are mingled! In the train, on\r\nleaving Glamis, I heard of the death of my dear uncle-like cousin Lord\r\nBloomfield, and while I was drawing Dunolly Sir John Lefevre was passing\r\naway! Though the delicate thread which bound his life to earth was so\r\nindescribably frail, it _had_ lasted so long, that it is difficult to\r\nrealise that his loving sympathy and the holy example of his beautiful,\r\nhumble, and self-forgetful life are removed from us. He was the best man\r\nI have ever known and the truest friend. His sweet courtesies were\r\nunbounded. His advice was always worth taking, for it was always\r\nunselfish, always carefully considered, and it always came from the\r\nheart. While I honoured him like a father, he was so genial that I could\r\nalso love him as an intimate friend.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Ascot, August 25, 1879._--I am thankful to have come here to the\r\nLefevres’ to-day, so filled with crushing sorrow to all my dear cousins,\r\nthough no one can help being comforted in the beautiful recollections of\r\nthe beloved father--of his boundless love to all, and his painless\r\npassage, full of thankfulness and love to the last, to the full fruition\r\nof that love in the unseen.\r\n\r\n“I walked with his children to the church, where his coffin already\r\nlay[317] in the chancel covered with garlands. Lord Eversley and Emma\r\nLefevre were there, and many others. The grave was in a sheltered corner\r\nof the churchyard, a sunny peaceful spot, and there, with aching hearts,\r\nwe laid him.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Ledbury Court,[318] Sept. 13._--This is just the sort of place which\r\nis pleasantest--great comfort and no pretension, rather under than over\r\na very good income. The house, many-gabled and quaint, is _in_ the old\r\nstreet of the town, but you drive into a large paved court with a\r\nporter’s lodge and pavilion, and clipped bay-trees in tubs like those of\r\nan old hotel in the Faubourg St. Germain. Behind, pleasant modern rooms\r\nand an oak library open upon lawns with brilliant flowers, beyond which\r\na deer-park extends up wavy hills to a high terrace with a noble view\r\nover the western counties.\r\n\r\n“On Wednesday we went to the musical festival at Hereford. The cathedral\r\nis entirely ruined by restoration--a disgusting polychrome roof, and a\r\npiteous glazed-tile floor replacing the ancient pavement consecrated by\r\nfive centuries. After the Oratorio we went to luncheon with the Bishop,\r\nDr. Attley, and at the palace I met many old friends.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday we went to Eastnor. Lord and Lady Somers were away, but we\r\nsaw the gardens, which would be beautiful if they were not spoilt by too\r\nmany pines and araucarias, and the house, a hideous castle of Otranto,\r\nso unworthily occupying a noble situation. It contains a few fine\r\npictures, but the rooms are frightful.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holme Lacy, Sept. 14._--My visit at Ledbury was a very happy one,\r\nLibbet so cheerful and pleasant, Charlie Adeane so engaging and\r\naffectionate, dear Lady Hardwicke so delightful, and Alick Yorke so\r\namusing.\r\n\r\n“I came here last night, met at the station by Sir Henry Stanhope. It\r\nhas been a magnificent place, but was injured as much as possible by the\r\nlate possessor with the assistance of the ignorant architect who built\r\nLord Dudley’s house in Park Lane, who tried hard to turn it from a\r\nFrench château into a Grecian villa. Some of the ceilings, however, are\r\nquite glorious, and there are many fine portraits.... Lady Scudamore\r\nStanhope, ‘the most popular woman in the county,’ was Sir Adam Hay’s\r\neldest daughter Dora.”[319]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Cheltenham, Sept. 15, 1879._--I do not know when, if ever, I have seen\r\nanything so beautiful as the park at Holme Lacy. All Sunday afternoon I\r\nwandered with Sir Henry Stanhope in its glorious glades, with fern nine\r\nfeet high, grand old oaks, white-stemmed beeches, and deep blue depths\r\nof mossy dingle. The garden too is quite a poem--such a harmony of\r\ncolour backed by great yew hedges and grand old pine-trees. Seven\r\nhundred people on an average come to see it on the days it is shown, and\r\nno wonder.... We went to service at an old church full of tombs of the\r\nfamily, and afterwards to the rectory close by, where there is a\r\nwonderful old pear-tree, of which the branches always take root again\r\nwhen they fall off, and cover an immense extent, sometimes producing as\r\nmuch as 2000 gallons of perry.\r\n\r\n“In coming hither I stayed to see Gloucester--scarcely worth while, all\r\nis so modernised. Yet the cathedral tower and crypt are beautiful, and\r\nthe Norman nave fine. I saw there the tomb of an ancestor, Sir\r\nOnesiphorus Paul, of whom I knew nothing before, but it appears from his\r\nepitaph that he was ‘the first to put into practice the humane designs\r\nof Howard as to prison discipline.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Cheltenham, Sept. 16._--Mrs. Orlando Kenyon is staying here with the\r\nCorbetts. She was a Cotton, and is a very charming person. She described\r\ngoing with her cousin Miss Cotton (now Dowager Marchioness of Downshire)\r\nto Peover for a ball. Just as they were setting off news arrived of the\r\ndeath of her cousin’s grandfather, old Mr. Fulke Greville. However, as\r\nthe visit was settled, it was decided that it should take place, only\r\nthat Miss Cotton should not go to the ball and her cousin should. They\r\nslept together at Peover. In the night Miss Cotton woke Mrs. Kenyon and\r\nsaid, ‘I have had such an extraordinary dream. I have seen my mother\r\nmoving backwards and forwards between the doors at the end of the room,\r\nnot walking, but apparently moving in the air--floating with a quantity\r\nof gossamer drapery round her; and when I close my eyes, I seem to see\r\nher still.’ In the morning the cousins returned to Combermere.\r\n\r\n“Just before dinner a servant called Mr. Cotton (Mrs. Kenyon’s father)\r\nand said Lord Combermere wanted to speak to him. ‘Oh,’ said Miss Cotton,\r\nspringing forward, ‘then I am sure some news has come by the post,’ and\r\nshe tried to insist upon following her uncle, but he would not allow\r\nher. Mr. Cotton came back greatly agitated, but insisted on their all\r\ngoing in to dinner. It was a most wretched meal. Afterwards he told the\r\nson and daughter that their mother had died (just after her father’s\r\nfuneral) very suddenly, just when she had appeared at Peover.\r\n\r\n“We went yesterday to Southam, the beautiful old house of the De la\r\nBeres. After the De la Beres became extinct, it was bought by Lord\r\nEllenborough, and it contains a mixture of relics of the two\r\nfamilies--charming old furniture and pictures, including a grand Holbein\r\nof Edward VI. One of the De la Beres saved the life of the Black Prince\r\nat Crecy, and a Prince of Wales’s helmet and feathers over a\r\nchimney-piece commemorate the fact. Three Miss Sergisons of Cuckfield\r\nPark inhabit the house now--kindly, pleasant old ladies.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Llanover, Sept. 20._--From Cheltenham I went to the Vaughans at\r\nLlandaff. It is a hideous drive from Cardiff, but at length you ascend a\r\nlittle hill which is crowned by a knot of buildings--deanery, canonry, a\r\nfew houses, a cross, and the picturesque ruins of the old palace, while\r\nthe lofty steeples of the really beautiful cathedral shoot up from the\r\ndepths below. It is, in fact, far more picturesque than many more\r\nimportant places, and the graveyard around the cathedral, and many\r\npicturesque corners inside, make it very attractive.\r\n\r\n“Kate took me to Castle Coch--a restored castle of Lord Bute,\r\nbeautifully situated. We went to the Palace and saw Mrs. Oliphant, the\r\ncharming old wife of the Bishop of Llandaff. Bishop Perry and his very\r\namusing wife took us with them to dine at Dufferin with a brother of\r\nLord Aberdare, whom we found there.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday I went for an hour to Caerphilly on the way here to Llanover,\r\nwhere I arrived at 7 P.M. The Hereditary Grand Duke of Baden had already\r\narrived and gone up to his room. I first saw him when the party was\r\nassembled for dinner--Lord and Lady Raglan, Miss Johnes, Mr. Ram, Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Sandford, and Mr. and Mrs. Herbert of Llanarth, with two sons,\r\ndaughter, and daughter-in-law. The Duke received me most cordially and\r\npleasantly.\r\n\r\n“After a very long dinner we all went into the hall, when, from the\r\ncurtains at the end, all the servants tripped in, each footman leading a\r\nmaid by each hand, in most picturesque Welsh costumes, made obeisance\r\nto the Prince, went backwards, and then danced the most complicated and\r\npicturesque of reels, with ever-varying figures. Lady Llanover’s own\r\nmaid was the great performer, and nothing could exceed her consummate\r\ngrace and dignity. Then a board was brought in and placed in the centre\r\nof the floor and three candles upon it, around and between which the\r\nfootmen and the harper’s boys performed the wonderful candle-dance with\r\nthe greatest agility.\r\n\r\n“Lady Llanover’s excess of courtesies and overwhelming deference were\r\nrather oppressive to us all, and evidently frightened the poor boyish\r\nPrince dreadfully last night; but this morning she did not come down,\r\nand we have got on splendidly, and he delighted in being talked to like\r\nother people, and was as natural and nice as he could be. He is\r\ncertainly a most bewitching Prince, so full of animation and fun, so\r\nright-minded and so courteous and simple.\r\n\r\n“In three carriages we went to Llanarth to luncheon. I went with the\r\nroyal carriage, which, with its smart scarlet postillions, certainly\r\nwent slow enough; for the dear old lady, to do the Prince more honour,\r\nhad engaged for the occasion not only the two horses used for the\r\nweddings at Abergavenny, but also the two used at funerals, and the\r\nsteeds of death outweighed those of mirth, and kept us down to a\r\nfunereal pace.\r\n\r\n“Llanarth is a sunny, well-kept place. Its great relic is the portrait\r\nof Pope’s Arabella Fermor, whose sister was a direct ancestress of the\r\npresent possessors. After luncheon, we all ranged on the steps and were\r\nphotographed, and then went on to Raglan, where Lord and Lady Raglan\r\n(she a very charming person) did the honours of the really beautiful\r\nruin. To my surprise, I heard the Duke beginning to compare it to\r\nHurstmonceaux, not knowing my connection with the latter. I drove back\r\nwith him, and told him many stories, and we made pleasant friendly\r\nacquaintance. He ran after me when we came in, and kept me to talk to\r\nhim quietly, and spoke very nicely and kindly of his mother’s liking for\r\nmy books. He has one of the most open, frank countenances I have ever\r\nlooked upon.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Llanover, Sept. 21._--This morning the Herberts went to mass at\r\nLlanarth, and we (English Church) had a queer service in the\r\ndrawing-room, with a congregation of eight, and a clergyman in a\r\nsurplice, &c. He gave a capital little sermon, but illustrated his text,\r\n‘Pray without ceasing,’ by the story of the Welsh Prince for whom all\r\nthe birds sang when they were asked. He was taken captive, and the birds\r\nimmediately became silent. Then his captors commanded them to sing, but\r\nstill all the birds in Wales held silence. Then they asked the captive\r\nPrince to desire them to sing, and he, kneeling down, prayed that God\r\nwould open the mouths of the birds, upon which they all sang lustily.\r\nThis was to prove that prayer was worth while even in the smallest\r\nthings of life!\r\n\r\n“The poor Prince has been victimised to-day to see all the relics of\r\nMrs. Delany, the fetish of this house, and was afterwards taken to the\r\nlake to see two coracles, the boats of ancient Wales, in which Ivor and\r\nArthur Herbert besported themselves.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Sept. 27._--On Monday, all Llanover was in motion for the\r\nPrince’s departure, more scarlet cloth than ever all over the place, the\r\nWelsh harpers harping at the door, the Welsh housemaids, in high hats\r\nand bright scarlet and blue petticoats, waiting with bouquets in the\r\npark, and every guest in the house compelled to go to the station to see\r\nthe Prince off. Highly comical was the scene on the platform--the yards\r\nof red cloth hurriedly thrown down by two footmen wherever the poor\r\nboyish Prince, in his brown frieze suit and wideawake hat, seemed likely\r\nto tread. I wished to have travelled to Windsor by Gloucester, which is\r\ntwo and a half hours’ less journey; but no, that was impossible: the\r\nQueen of England sometimes has her own way; the Queen of South Wales\r\n_always_.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Herbert of Llanarth was sent to travel with the Prince to Malvern,\r\nMr. Ram to Worcester, I to Oxford. However, one could hardly see too\r\nmuch of him, he is such a nice Prince--kind, courteous, clever,\r\nintelligent, simple, and sincere. Captain Sommer, the gentleman in\r\nwaiting, is also a most superior person.\r\n\r\n“I reached Ronald Gower in the evening. He met me at the Windsor\r\nstation, and took me to his really charming little house, which is full\r\nof lovely things. It is an odd _ménage_, with the artistic valet, Robert\r\nStubbs, supreme. It was a great pleasure to take up with Ronald the\r\nlinks of a much-relaxed, never-forgotten friendship, and to find him far\r\nnicer than I had remembered him.\r\n\r\n“We spent Tuesday at Cliveden, a pouring day, but it did not matter. The\r\nDuchess of Westminster[320] is Ronald’s favourite sister, and was very\r\npleasant and cordial to his friend. She is gloriously handsome, though\r\nso large. We talked for four hours without ceasing, and she took us into\r\nevery corner of the beautiful house full of charming pictures, and then\r\nput on an ulster and hood and walked with us through the torrents of\r\nrain to the conservatories. One felt that she was a person to whom one\r\ncould say anything without being misunderstood, and who would become an\r\nincreasingly true friend. Her daughter, Lady Beatrice Cavendish, was\r\nthere, and the handsome young husband, Compton Cavendish, Lord Chesham’s\r\nson, came in to luncheon and tea. All saw us off at 5 P.M. in the little\r\ncart with Piggy the pony.\r\n\r\n“On Wednesday morning we went into the castle to see Lady Ponsonby, who\r\nlives in the old prison over Edward III.’s gateway--most curious, and\r\nfitted up in admirable taste, despairing to Mr. Ayrton.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Osterley Park, Nov. 13._--I came here yesterday, most kindly welcomed\r\nby the good old Duchess of Cleveland, who is delightful. The greatness\r\nof her charm certainly lies in the absence of charm: no one ever had\r\nless of it. But what bright intelligence, what acute perceptions, what\r\ngenuine kindness, what active beneficence! I found Julia, Lady Jersey,\r\nhere, and Mr. Brandling, and a Mr. and Mrs. Bramston, relations of the\r\nCleveland family. After dinner, the Duchess made me sit exclusively by\r\nher, saying kindly that she could not waste any of my short visit. She\r\ntalked in a very interesting way of the great Duke of Wellington, and\r\nthen of the present Duke. She said that when she asked the latter if\r\nthe great Duke had never shown him any kindness, he said, ‘No, he never\r\neven so much as patted me on the shoulder when I was a boy, but it was\r\nbecause he hated my mother.’\r\n\r\n“After luncheon to-day I walked with Brandling and Colonel Bramston to\r\nBoston Hall, the fine old house of the Clitherows.\r\n\r\n“As Lady Caroline Paulet, the Duchess of Cleveland used to be very proud\r\nof her little foot. She wore an anklet, and would often sit upon a\r\ntable, and let it fall down over her foot to show it. It was inscribed,\r\n‘La légèreté de Camille et la vitesse d’Atalante.’ One day Lady Isabella\r\nSt. John, who was equally proud of her little foot, said, ‘I wish you\r\nwould let me try if I can get your anklet over my foot, Lady Caroline.’\r\nAnd she put it on, and, to Lady Caroline’s great disgust, _kicked it\r\noff_, to show how easily her foot would go through it.\r\n\r\n“In those long-ago days--one cannot imagine it now--she used to be very\r\n_décolletée_, and the Duchess Elizabeth (Miss Russell), who did not like\r\nher, once flung a napkin at her across the table, saying, ‘Caroline,\r\nhere is something to cover your nakedness with.’\r\n\r\n“How many and amusing are the anecdotes remembered of that Duchess\r\nElizabeth, who went on receiving a pension from the Duke of Bedford, as\r\nhis cast-off mistress, after she was married to the Duke of Cleveland.\r\nShe had been a washerwoman. She left Newton House, where she lived as a\r\nwidow, to her nephew Mr. Russell, whose grandson married a Lushington.\r\nShe gave £70,000 to her niece Laura when she married Lord Mulgrave, and\r\nthe marriage very nearly went off because the Normanbys stuck out for\r\n£100,000. ‘Laura is not my only niece, remember that,’ she said, and\r\nthen they became frightened. She used to call Lord Harry Vane ‘My\r\n‘Arry.’ One day, with Mr. Francis Grey, the conversation turned upon\r\nVenus. ‘I do not like her,’ she said; ‘she had a bad figure, and by no\r\nmeans a good character.’ Her companion laughed and said, ‘She mistakes\r\nher for a living person,’ and so she did.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 14._--Life is very pleasant in this fine old house, and its long\r\nsunny gallery full of books and pictures is a delightful resort on\r\nwinter mornings. We breakfast at ten, during which Mr. Spencer\r\nLyttelton, who is frequently here, does his best to shock people for the\r\nday, but is certainly very clever and amusing. I never saw any one who\r\ncalled a spade a spade as he does, but I believe he likes every one to\r\nthink him worse than he is. This morning I walked with Brandling in the\r\nlong shrubberies, the great trees casting perfectly blue shadows upon\r\nthe park white with hoar-frost and the lake thinly coated with ice.\r\n\r\n“In the afternoon we went to Ham House--a most curious visit. No\r\nhalf-inhabited château of a ruined family in Normandy was ever half so\r\ndilapidated as this home of the enormously rich Tollemaches. Like a\r\nFrench château too is the entrance through a gateway to a desolate yard\r\nwith old trees and a sundial, and a donkey feeding. All the members of\r\nthe family whom I knew were absent, but I sent in my card to Mr.\r\nAlgernon Tollemache, who received us. As the door at the head of the\r\nentrance-stair opened, its handle went through a priceless Sir Joshua\r\nof Louisa, Countess of Dysart: it always does go through it. We were\r\ntaken through a half-ruined hall and a bedroom to an inner room in which\r\nMr. Algernon Tollemache (unable to move from illness) was sitting. It\r\npresented the most unusual contrasts imaginable--a velvet bed in a\r\nrecess backed by the most exquisite embroidery on Chinese silk; an\r\nuncarpeted floor of rough boards; a glorious Lely portrait of the\r\nDuchess of Lauderdale; a deal board by way of washing-stand, with a\r\ncoarse white jug and basin upon it; a splendid mirror framed in massive\r\nsilver on a hideous rough deal scullery table without a cover; and all\r\nMr. Tollemache’s most extraordinarily huge boots and shoes ranged round\r\nthe room by way of ornament.\r\n\r\n“The vast house is like a caravansary; in one apartment lives young Lord\r\nDysart, the real owner; in another his Roman Catholic mother, Lady\r\nHuntingtower, and her two Protestant daughters; in a third, his\r\ngreat-aunt, Lady Laura Grattan; in a fourth, his uncle, Mr. Frederick\r\nTollemache, who manages the property; in a fifth, Mr. and Mrs. Algernon\r\nTollemache, who made a great fortune in Australia.\r\n\r\n“We were sent over the house. All was of the same character--a glorious\r\nstaircase with splendid carving in deep relief; the dismal chapel in\r\nwhich the different members of the family, amongst them Lady\r\nAilesbury[321] and Lady Sudeley,[322] have been married, with the\r\nprayer-book of Charles I., in a most wonderful cover of metallic\r\nembroidery; marvellous old rooms with lovely delicate silk hangings of\r\nexquisitely beautiful tints, though mouldering in rags; old Persian\r\ncarpets of priceless designs worn to shreds; priceless Japanese screens\r\nperishing; beautiful pictures dropping to pieces for want of varnish;\r\nsilver grates, tongs, and bellows; magnificent silver tables; black\r\nchandeliers which look like ebony and are solid silver; a library full\r\nof Caxtons, the finest collection in the world except two; a china\r\ncloset with piles of old Chelsea, undusted and untouched for years; a\r\nlovely little room full of miniatures, of which the most beautiful of\r\nall was brought down for us to examine closer. ‘Do you see that mark?’\r\nsaid Mr. Tollemache. ‘Thirty years ago a spot appeared there upon the\r\nminiature, so I opened the case and wetted my finger and rubbed it: I\r\ndid not know paint came off(!). Wasn’t it fortunate I did not wipe my\r\nwet hand down over the whole picture: it would _all_ have come\r\noff!’[323]\r\n\r\n“And the inhabitants of this palace, which looks like that of the\r\nSleeping Beauty in the Wood, have wealth which is inexhaustible, though\r\nthey have scarcely any servants, no carriage, only bread and cheese for\r\nluncheon, and never repair or restore anything.\r\n\r\n“All the family have had their peculiarities. The late Lord Huntingtower\r\nwas at one time separated from his wife, and when he was persuaded that\r\nhe ought in common justice to allow her to return to Ham, he assented,\r\nbut he draped the gates and portico with black cloth for her reception,\r\nand he put a band of black cloth round the left leg of every animal on\r\nthe estate, the cows in the field, the horses in the stable, even the\r\ndogs and the cats. _His_ grandfather, Lord Huntingtower, was more\r\nextraordinary still. When he bought a very nice estate with a house near\r\nBuckminster, he bought all the contents of the house at the same time.\r\nThere was a very good collection of pictures, but ‘What do I want with\r\npictures? All that rubbish shall be burnt,’ he said. ‘But, my lord, they\r\nare very _good_ pictures.’ ‘Well, bring them all down here and make a\r\nvery great fire, and I will see them burnt.’ And he did.\r\n\r\n“There is a ghost at Ham. The old butler there had a little girl, and\r\nthe Ladies Tollemache kindly asked her to come on a visit: she was then\r\nsix years old. In the small hours of the morning, when dawn was making\r\nthings clear, the child, waking up, saw a little old woman scratching\r\nwith her fingers against the wall close to the fireplace. She was not at\r\nall frightened at first, but sat up to look at her. The noise she made\r\nin doing this caused the old woman to look round, and she came to the\r\nfoot of the bed, and grasping the rail with her hands, stared at the\r\nchild long and fixedly. So horrible was her stare, that the child was\r\nterrified, and screamed and hid her face under the clothes. People who\r\nwere in the passage ran in, and the child told what she had seen. The\r\nwall was examined where she had seen the figure scratching, and\r\nconcealed in it were found papers which proved that in that room\r\nElizabeth, Countess of Dysart, had murdered her husband to marry the\r\nDuke of Lauderdale.”[324]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE VERANDAH, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Nov. 24._--Here I am at home again, and we are very busy\r\nincreasing the walks round the tiny property with the money which dear\r\nAunt Sophy left. They will present quite a miniature variety of scenery\r\nnow--the ilex walk recalling Italy, and the fir-wood the Black Forest,\r\nbut the thick wood at the bottom, and its tiny glens and brook and\r\nbridges, could only be in England. In this wood we are trying to coax a\r\nthousand interesting flowers to ‘grow wild,’ and puzzle the botanists of\r\nthe twentieth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VERANDAH STEPS, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n“I spent the last three days of my absence with Hugh Pearson in his\r\ncanonry at Windsor, a delightful old house overlooking the steep ascent\r\nof the hill, where different members of the royal family are constantly\r\ndropping in to visit the dearest man in the world, as the princesses of\r\nGeorge III.’s time did to visit Mrs. Delany--and no wonder!\r\n\r\n“Willie Stephens[325] and I had much interesting talk with the beloved\r\nH. Pearson; after being with other people, there is an ease in talking\r\nto him which is like exchanging a frock-coat for a shooting-coat.\r\n\r\n“On Friday poor Prince Alemayu of Abyssinia (King Theodore’s son) was\r\nburied in Windsor Castle. After he came from Abyssinia the Queen adopted\r\nhim, and he had no one else to look to, for his mother died of\r\nconsumption on her way to England, and his only other near relation, his\r\nuncle, the present King, would certainly have cut his head off at once\r\nif he had returned to Abyssinia. He was at Rugby at Jex Blake’s house,\r\nand then at a private tutor’s to prepare him for the army, but he always\r\npassed his holidays in the castle with Lady Biddulph, and was like a\r\nyounger brother to Victor Biddulph, her son. Every one liked him. Lately\r\nhe had been at a tutor’s near Leeds, where he became ill of inflammation\r\nof the lungs, probably rapid consumption. Lady Biddulph did not believe\r\nin the danger, but Mrs. Jex Blake went to him, and her account of his\r\nlast hours was most touching. He said to her, ‘No doubts: no doubts at\r\nall,’ and then he died.\r\n\r\n“On Thursday he was brought to Windsor, and we went to look at his\r\ncoffin in the little mortuary chapel, draped with black and white, in\r\nfront of Princess Charlotte’s monument.\r\n\r\n“The funeral was at twelve on Friday. The chapel was full. Most\r\nexquisitely beautiful was the singing--the gradual swell of ‘I am the\r\nResurrection and the Life’ as the procession formed at the west door and\r\nmoved slowly up the nave into the choir. The coffin was piled with\r\nflowers upon a violet and white pall. Lady Biddulph and her children\r\nknelt on one side. Prince Christian, the Chancellor of the Exchequer (as\r\nguardian of the Prince), and Mr. Lowe were amongst the mourners. The\r\nDead March was played most grandly as the procession moved out again to\r\nthe little graveyard by the west door, where the snow had fallen thick\r\nupon the flowers by which the newly-made grave was surrounded.\r\n\r\n“I have heard a very eerie story from Lady Waterford:--There is a place\r\nin Scotland called Longmacfergus. Mr. and Mrs. Spottiswoode lived there,\r\nwho were the father and mother of Lady John Scott, and they vouched for\r\nthe story. The villagers of Longmacfergus are in the habit of going to\r\ndo their marketing at the little town of Dunse, and though their nearest\r\nway home would be by crossing the burn at a point called ‘the Foul\r\nFord,’ they always choose another and longer way by preference, for the\r\nFoul Ford is always looked upon as haunted. There was a farmer who lived\r\nin Longmacfergus, and who was highly respected, and very well-to-do. One\r\nnight his wife was expecting him back from the market at Dunse, and he\r\ndid not appear. Late and long she waited and he did not come, but at\r\nlast, after midnight, when she was very seriously alarmed, he knocked\r\nviolently at the door and she let him in. She was horrified to see his\r\nwild and agonised expression, and the awful change which had taken place\r\nin his whole aspect since they parted. He told her that he had come home\r\nby the Foul Ford, and that he must rue the day and the way, for he must\r\ndie before morning. He begged her to send for the minister, for he must\r\nsee him at once. She was terrified at his state, and implored him rather\r\nto send for the doctor, but he said, ‘No, the minister--the minister was\r\nthe only person who could do him any good.’ However, being a wise woman,\r\nshe sent for both minister and doctor. When the doctor came, he said he\r\ncould do nothing for the man, the case was past his cure, but the\r\nminister spent several hours with the farmer. Before morning he died,\r\nand what he said that night to the minister never was told till many\r\nyears after.\r\n\r\n“Naturally the circumstances of the farmer’s, death made the inhabitants\r\nof Longmacfergus regard the Foul Ford with greater terror than before,\r\nand for a few years no one attempted to use it. At last, however, there\r\ncame a day when the son of the dead farmer was persuaded to linger\r\nlonger than usual drinking at Dunse, and after being twitted by his\r\ncomrades for cowardice in not returning the shortest way, he determined\r\nto risk it, and set out with a brave heart. That night _his_ wife sat\r\nwatching in vain for his return, and she watched in vain till morning,\r\nfor he never came back. In the morning the neighbours went to search for\r\nhim, and he was found lying dead on the bank above the Foul Ford,\r\nand--it is a foolish fact perhaps, but it has always been narrated as a\r\nfact incidental to the story, that--though there were no marks of\r\nviolence upon his person, and though his coat was on, his waistcoat was\r\noff and lying by the side of his body upon the grass; his watch and his\r\nmoney were left intact in his pockets.\r\n\r\n“After his funeral the minister said to the assembled mourners and\r\nparishioners, that now that the second death had occurred of the son, he\r\nthought that he should be justified in revealing the substance of the\r\nstrange confession which the father had made on the night he died. He\r\nsaid that he had crossed the wooden bridge of the Foul Ford, and was\r\ncoming up the brae on the other side, when he met a procession of\r\nhorsemen dressed in black, riding two and two upon black horses. As they\r\ncame up, he saw amongst them, to his horror, every one he had known\r\namongst his neighbours of Longmacfergus, and who were already dead. But\r\nthe man who rode last--the last man who had died--was leading a\r\nriderless horse. As he came up, he dismounted by the farmer’s side, and\r\nsaid that the horse was for him. The farmer refused to mount, and all\r\nhis former neighbours tried to force him on to the horse. They had a\r\ndeadly struggle, in which at last the farmer seemed to get the better,\r\nfor the horseman rode away, leading the riderless horse, but he said,\r\n‘Never mind, you will want it before morning.’ And before morning he was\r\ndead.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was with a feeling of strangeness that, in the autumn of 1879, I felt\r\nthat my royal duties were over. I did not see the Prince of Sweden again\r\nafter his return from Scotland.\r\n\r\nI have heard since at intervals from the Prince (whose career I always\r\nfollow with deepest interest), and from the beloved Queen, by the hand\r\nof Countess Rosen; but their letters have referred rather to the past\r\nthan to the present or future: my part in the Prince’s life is probably\r\nover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nA HALT IN LIFE\r\n\r\n    “When I recall my youth, what I was then,\r\n       What I am now, ye beloved ones all;\r\n     It seems as though these were the living men,\r\n       And we the coloured shadows on the wall.”\r\n             --MONCKTON MILNES.\r\n\r\n     “Pain and joy, deception and fulfilled hopes, are just the rain and\r\n     the sunshine that must meet the traveller on his way.

Daldy and Isbister, had astounded\r\nthe literary world by becoming bankrupt. They had been personally\r\npleasant to deal with; I had never doubted their solvency; and I was on\r\nterms of friendly intercourse with Mr. Isbister. In April 1878 he wrote\r\nto me saying that he knew I applied the interest of money derived from\r\nmy books to charitable purposes, and that he would much rather bestow\r\nthe large interest he was prepared to give for such purpose than any\r\nother, and he asked me to lend him £1500. I had not the sum at the time\r\nhe asked for it, but, about a week later, being advised to sell out that\r\nsum from some American securities, I lent it to him. Then, within a\r\nmonth, the firm declared itself bankrupt, owing me in all nearly £3000,\r\nand the £1500 and much more was apparently lost for ever.[326] In\r\naccepting contracts for my different books, I had always fully\r\nunderstood, and been given to understand, that I never parted with the\r\ncopyright. I believe that most publishers would have informed an\r\nignorant author that the very unusual forms of agreement they prepared\r\ninvolved the copyright, but I was allowed to suppose that I retained it\r\nin my own hands. I first discovered my mistake after their bankruptcy,\r\nwhen, besides owing me nearly £3000, Messrs. Daldy and Isbister demanded\r\na bonus of £1500 (which I refused, offering £850 in vain) for giving me\r\nthe permission to go on circulating my own books through another\r\npublisher.\r\n\r\nAs it was impossible to come to terms, my unfortunate books lapsed. In\r\nthe autumn of 1879 Messrs. Daldy and Isbister offered to submit to an\r\narbitrator the question of the amount to be paid to my so-great debtors\r\nfor the liberty of continuing to publish my books. Three eminent\r\npublishing firms chose an arbitrator, but when he sent in his estimate\r\nthey would not agree to it.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances made such a discouragement for any real work, that\r\nfor two years I did nothing of a literary character beyond collecting\r\nthe reminiscences contained in these volumes. The first year was chiefly\r\noccupied by my duties towards the Crown Prince of Sweden and Norway. In\r\nthe second year I had a comparative holiday. It is therefore that I call\r\nit “A Halt in Life.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn November 1879 an event occurred which would at one time have affected\r\nme very deeply--the death of the Mary Stanley who for many years ruled\r\nmy adopted family by the force of her strong will, and who, after my\r\ndearest Mother was taken away from me, remorselessly used that power to\r\nexpel me from the hearts and homes of those over whom she had any\r\ninfluence, in her fury at the publication of the “Memorials of a Quiet\r\nLife.” Yet, when her restless spirit was quieted by Death, I could only\r\nremember the kind “Cousin Mary” of my childhood, when my greatest\r\ndelight was to go to her room at Norwich, and so many of my little\r\npleasures came from her.\r\n\r\n    “Where thou hast touched, O wondrous Death!\r\n       Where thou hast come between,\r\n     Lo, there for ever perisheth\r\n       The common and the mean.\r\n     No little flaw or trivial speck\r\n       Doth any more appear,\r\n     And cannot, from this time, to fleck\r\n       Love’s perfect image clear.”[327]\r\n\r\nHard to those in her own class, and with them ever occupied in asserting\r\nand insisting upon her own little imaginary dignities, Mary Stanley did\r\nmore unselfish work for the poor than almost any one, and hundreds of\r\nwhom nothing is known in the society in which she lived miss and mourn\r\nher. Probably only the poor knew the best, the really beautiful side of\r\nMary Stanley’s life, which was _most_ beautiful.\r\n\r\nI often wish, as regards her, I could have profited more by words of\r\nMrs. Kemble which I read too late to apply them--“Do you not know that\r\nto misunderstand and be misunderstood is one of the inevitable\r\nconclusions, and I think one of the especial purposes, of our existence?\r\nThe principal use of the affection of human beings for each other is to\r\nsupply the want of perfect comprehension, which is impossible. All the\r\nfaith and love which we possess are barely sufficient to bridge over the\r\nabyss of individualism which separates one human being from another; and\r\nthey would not, or could not, exist, if we really understood each\r\nother.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM S. GREGORIO, MESSINA.][328]\r\n\r\nIn December I went abroad to join the two Miss Hollands--my Norwegian\r\ncompanions--at Ancona, and go on with them to Sicily, a journey through\r\ndeep snow and agonising cold. After I met the Hollands and their friend\r\nMiss Lily Howard, we went rapidly south, with Sir George Baker, his wife\r\nand daughter, semi-annexed to our party, and at Reggio we found\r\nsummer--palms, bananas, blue skies and sunshine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAORMINA.][329]\r\n\r\nOur wretched journey made the first morning at Messina quite enchanting,\r\nas we climbed the heights, looking down upon the straits and to the\r\npurple peaks of Italy, their tips glistening with snow. Nespoli,\r\ndaturas, and camellias grew as trees in full bloom; the gardens were a\r\nmass of salvias, trumpet-flower, and roses; heliotrope in full blossom\r\nhung over the high walls, and quantities of scarlet geraniums grew wild\r\nupon the beach.\r\n\r\nMore lovely still was Taormina, hanging like an eagle’s nest on the\r\nledge of the mountain, and looking down into the blue sea, which breaks\r\ninto emerald near the snowy line of breakers. On one side is Etna, quite\r\ngigantic, with pathless fields of snow even upon the lower heights; on\r\nthe other are the grand ruins of the Theatre, from which, above the\r\nbroken arches and pillars, the queen of fire and snow looms unspeakably\r\nsublime. Our pleasant primitive inn was in a quiet street, where all the\r\ndaily incidents were lovely--the goats coming in the early morning to be\r\nmilked: the peasants riding in upon their asses: the convent bells\r\njangling: the women returning from the fountain with vases of old Greek\r\nforms upon their heads, burnished yellow, green, or red: the singing at\r\nAve Maria and Benediction. We spent several days at Taormina, drawing\r\nquietly in the mornings amongst the rocky beds of pinks, and snapdragon,\r\nand silene: reading aloud in the evenings--Thucydides, Gregorovius, and\r\nthen a novel for relaxation: the four ladies and their maid\r\noccasionally singing in parts as in Norway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROMAN AMPHITHEATRE, SYRACUSE.][330]\r\n\r\nWe were sorry to go on to Syracuse, for though many had told us of its\r\nintense interest and curiosity, no one had spoken of its extreme\r\nloveliness. Of its five towns, only the island-town of Ortygia remains.\r\nAcradina, Neapolis, Tycho, and Epipolae are desolate hillsides covered\r\nwith pink-grey limestone, overgrown with wild figs, olives, prickly\r\npears, and ten thousand lovely flowers; and from their sunny slopes you\r\nlook to the blue mountains of Hybla and the rose-coloured rocks of\r\nMegara. Here and there, in the most exquisite situations, are Roman, and\r\nstill more beautiful Greek ruins, which seem to have grown into the\r\nscenery and become part of it, gilded by lichen, fringed with flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM THE WALLS OF EPIPOLAE.][331]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE RIVER CYANE.][332]\r\n\r\nEach morning at Syracuse we engaged little carriages (costing one\r\nshilling the hour) for the day, and took with us a well-filled luncheon\r\nbasket for ourselves and our charming young drivers, and we wandered,\r\nand studied, and drew for hours. We spent a whole day on the grand\r\nheights of Epipolae, looking on one side across a luxuriant plain to\r\nsnowy Etna, and on the other across the vast ruined city to the blue\r\nsea, with Ortygia gleaming upon it like a jewel. Another whole day was\r\ngiven to ascending the rivers Anapus and Pisma to the mystic blue\r\nfountain of Cyane: the most romantic of boating excursions, the boatmen\r\nevery now and then being obliged to jump into the water and push the\r\nboat over the shallows or through the thick water-plants: the papyrus\r\nwith its exquisite feathery crests almost meeting overhead, or grouped\r\ninto the most glorious masses on the islets in midstream: enchanting\r\nlittle views opening every now and then to palms and cypresses and blue\r\nrifts in the roseate rocks of Megara; now a foreground of oleanders,\r\nthen of splendid castor-oil plants. In returning, we walked up a hill to\r\nthe Temple of Jupiter Olympus, through a perfect blaze of dwarf blue\r\niris, the loveliest flowers I ever saw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ACI CASTELLO.][333]\r\n\r\nWe spent the four first days of the New Year at Catania, a dull town,\r\nthough backed by the glorious snow-fields of Etna, and we made thence\r\ntwo excursions--to Aci Castello, a beautiful old castle on lava rocks,\r\nand to Aci Reale, with the spring into which Acis, the lover of Galatea,\r\nis supposed to have been changed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEMPLE OF CONCORD, GIRGENTI.][334]\r\n\r\nAt Girgenti we found an excellent hotel, with rooms opening to\r\ndelightful balconies, overhanging--at a great height--one of the\r\nnoblest views in the world, billow upon billow of purple hill, crested\r\nwith hoary olives, and with masses of oranges and caroubas in all the\r\nsheltered nooks, a vast expanse of glistening sea, and a range of Greek\r\ntemples in desolate loveliness. The landlord, Don Gaetano de Angelis,\r\nwas a stately old Sicilian, who treated us far more like honoured guests\r\nthan customers, and fed us so luxuriously and magnificently that we\r\nwondered how it was possible he could repay himself. He had lately\r\nmarried for the second time, a pretty merry child-wife in huge gold\r\nearrings, who paid us frequent visits, and was delighted with us and\r\nour drawings, and to sit for her portrait. They quite enjoyed the\r\npreparation of the luncheon basket, with which we always set off at 9\r\nA.M., not returning till the sunset had turned the sea rose-colour and\r\nset the mountains aflame. Each day we picnicked amongst the asphodels\r\nand lilies in the shadow of one of the Greek temples, and were glad to\r\nfind a shelter from the burning sun, which blazed in a sky that only\r\nturned from turquoise to opal. Some of the temples are nearly perfect,\r\nsome mere masses of ruin, or one or two pillars with a beautiful bit of\r\nyellow architrave set in the most exquisite landscape--delicate pink\r\nmountain distances, and foregrounds of grand old olive-trees or almonds\r\nflushing into richest bloom, above a ground enamelled with flowers of\r\nevery hue. We all agreed in thinking Girgenti more beautiful than any\r\nother place, and its people even more charming than the scenery, so full\r\nof kindly simplicity, from the Syndic to Pasqualuccio, the little\r\ngoatherd, with coins in his earrings after the old Greek fashion, who\r\ngives each of his goats a _colazione_ of acanthus leaves, set out like\r\nplates on a dinner-table, on the fallen columns in the Temple of Juno.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE TEMPLE OF JUNO LACINIA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE TEMPLE OF HERCULES.][335]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEMPLE OF CASTOR AND POLLUX, GIRGENTI.][336]\r\n\r\nThe second day after our arrival, as we were returning home up the hill\r\nin the still warm evening light, we turned aside to the old deserted\r\nconvent of S. Niccola. A merry crowd of gentlemen and ladies and little\r\nboys and girls were shouting and singing on the terrace, and dancing the\r\ntarantella to the music of three peasants on a bagpipe, tambourine, and\r\ntriangle. Like a Bacchanalian rout of old times they came rushing down\r\nto meet us, twenty-six in number, chained together with garlands, and\r\nthe girls all wreathed with wild scarlet geranium. They escorted us all\r\nover the garden, gathering flowers and fruits for us, the crowd of\r\nlittle children gambolling and dancing in front. Then they begged us to\r\ngo back with them to the terrace, and began dancing again, and were\r\ndelighted when Miss Howard and Miss G. Holland danced with them.\r\nAfterwards, standing on the terrace, our three ladies sang one of their\r\nbeautiful part songs, tumultuously applauded with _prosit_ and _evviva_.\r\nThe result was showers of visiting-cards from all the notables in\r\nGirgenti, especially from a family who rejoice in the singular name of\r\nthe _Indelicati_. Then came invitations to a party and ball at Casa\r\nGibilaro, the sons of the house, Cesare and Salvatore, coming to escort\r\nus up the steep street. Italian ladies sang, and so did our party, and\r\nall danced, and we taught the Girgentines Sir Roger de Coverley, which\r\ngreatly enchanted them. The family of twenty-six--grandmother, uncles,\r\naunts, cousins, were all there, living in the happiest union and\r\naffection, no daughter of the house ever marrying out of the place, and\r\nall meeting constantly. Carmela and Pasqualina Gibilaro were so\r\nenchanted with our two younger ladies, that they scarcely ever let go of\r\ntheir hands, and expressed their delight over them in the most naïve\r\nmanner, and I became great friends with Salvatore and Antonio. One day,\r\nSalvatore and Pasqualina dined with us, and we afterwards went again to\r\ntheir house, where there was another dance, at which all the professors\r\nof the university (on delightful terms of merriment with their pupils)\r\nassisted, the Professor of Theology frisking about in the tarantella,\r\nand the Professor of Philosophy leading the cotillon. We wished this\r\ntime to leave early, but our hosts insisted on our waiting till the\r\narrival of ices, an unwonted luxury with them, but ordered in our\r\nhonour. We had dined before, and since coming to the dance had been\r\nobliged to eat quantities of _pasticcie_, so were aghast when we found\r\nthat we were each expected to eat an ice larger than an ordinary\r\ntea-cake. We managed as well as we could, but it was dreadful. I\r\ndeposited more than half mine under a table. Miss Holland thought she\r\nwas getting on pretty well with hers, when a Contessa Indelicato, on the\r\nopposite side of the room, seeing her flagging, filled a large spoon\r\nwith her own ice, and rushing across, popped it into her mouth. With\r\ngreat promptitude Miss Howard instantly popped a spoonful of _her_ ice\r\ninto the mouth of a Contessina Indelicato! Great were the lamentations\r\nand embraces from this amiable family when we left Girgenti, dear little\r\nAntonio Gibilaro going with us to the station.\r\n\r\nI spent the last morning at Girgenti in drawing the sea glistening\r\nthrough the pink almond-trees, and the rocky road with its troops of\r\ngoats and donkeys, and in the afternoon of January 11 we went on to\r\nPalermo.\r\n\r\nUnder the later Bourbon kings Sicily was perfectly safe and brigandage\r\nutterly unknown, for the principal officials in each village and parish\r\nwere made responsible for its security; but the annihilation of the\r\nrural police under the Sardinian Government taking place at the same\r\ntime with the abolition of capital punishment, had introduced\r\nbrigandage; and though it had become rare since the formation of\r\nrailroads, it was not considered safe for us to go far from Palermo\r\nwithout an escort, and we were obliged to give up Segeste. When we were\r\nat Palermo, murders for _vendetta_ were of constant occurrence, and only\r\ncost three hundred francs, as the punishment was so slight,--generally\r\ntwo years’ imprisonment without labour, and with a life of much greater\r\ncomfort than the culprit could have enjoyed at home. Besides, the\r\nmurderers are scarcely ever given up, as the _vendetta_ would then fall\r\nupon those who betrayed them. Some of our party went to visit\r\nCalatafimi, the brigand who carried off a gentleman from Cefalu, and,\r\nwhen he got only half the ransom required, laboriously snipped with\r\nscissors till his head came off, in a cave on Monte Pellegrino. He was\r\nfound very merry, in most comfortable quarters, with quantities of\r\nfruit, newspapers, &c. When he was tired of being there, his family\r\nwould bribe the gaoler, and he would get out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PALERMO, FROM S. MARIA DI GESU.]\r\n\r\nThe glorious weather we enjoyed in the south of the island turned to\r\ntorrents of rain at Palermo, but it is said that there are only\r\nforty-two days in the year without rain there. On the rare occasions\r\nwhen it clears, Palermo is most lovely, backed by such grand mountains,\r\nthe nearer ones rugged purple rocks, over which the snow-peaks peep out.\r\nThe cathedral also is very beautiful, with a great courtyard in front of\r\nit planted with palm-trees and geraniums; but there are none of the\r\nglorious flowers of Girgenti; the climate is a constant damp chill, like\r\nthat of Pau and Pisa, and I shall always associate the place with the\r\nceaseless melancholy roar of the sea, the drip and splash of the rain,\r\nwhich fell day and night, and the monotony of the mouldy deserted walks.\r\nIn the Lazaretto cemetery--a lovely little spot hedged with Barbary\r\naloes--it was touching to see the tomb of my almost unknown father. He\r\nalso hated the place and was deeply depressed there.\r\n\r\nOur one really fine day was delightful. We drove along the shore to\r\nBagaria, where all the old nobility have their country palaces, enormous\r\nand stately in form, with huge courts and immense armorial shields over\r\ntheir gates, but the windows generally half choked up or glassless, the\r\ncourts overgrown with weeds, and the roofs tumbling in. Sad indeed\r\nwould be the shock to an English girl who married a Sicilian prince for\r\nhis title and his “palace,” upon her arrival at one of these old\r\nbarracks, where she would be lucky if she could find one weathertight\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOLUNTO.]\r\n\r\nBeyond Bagaria, Capo Zafferano strides into the sea--a grand mountain,\r\ncovered with cactus almost to the top; and here, high on the rocks, are\r\nthe ruins of Solunto, a Carthaginian city--broad streets edged by\r\ndiminutive houses and temples in the style of Pompeii. We picnicked at\r\nSolunto in the cactus shade, and drew all day the glorious view across\r\nthe bay to the purple crags and fantastic forms of Monte Griffone.\r\n\r\nAnother day we went to Monreale, the grand semi-Saracenic cathedral,\r\ncovered with mosaics, on the heights behind Palermo. It reminds me of a\r\nstory the late Lord Clanwilliam used to tell, which I will insert\r\nhere:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“A Knight of Malta, who, by the rules of his Order, was both a soldier\r\nand a priest, was once travelling in Sicily. Being at Palermo, he\r\nstrolled up to Monreale; it was a lovely evening, and in the great\r\ncathedral, where the shade was so welcome after the heat of the way, the\r\neffect was exquisitely beautiful, as the sunset streamed through the\r\nlong windows upon the mosaic walls. Being an artist, the knight took out\r\nhis sketch-book and began to draw, first one lovely arch and then\r\nanother, till the waning light warned him that night was approaching.\r\nThen he made his way to the western door, but it was closed. He turned\r\nto the side doors, to the sacristy; they were closed also. It was\r\nevident that he was locked into the cathedral, and though he shouted and\r\nkicked at the door, he could make no one hear. Spending the night alone\r\nin a church had no terrors for him: it was only on account of the\r\ndiscomfort that he objected to it; so he found his way to a confessional\r\nfar up the church, and made himself as comfortable there as he could\r\nwith all the cushions he could collect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLOISTERS, MONREALE.][337]\r\n\r\n“Most wondrously beautiful is the cathedral of Monreale when the moon\r\ncasts its magic halo over the ancient mosaics, and so it was on this\r\nnight, when the artist-soldier-priest sat entranced with its unspeakable\r\nloveliness. The whole building was bathed in softest light, each avenue\r\nof arches at once a poem and a picture, when the clock struck twelve.\r\nThen from the west door a figure seemed to be approaching, a cowled\r\nfigure in monastic robes, and the stranger felt with satisfaction that\r\nhe had been missed and that one of the monks of the adjoining monastery\r\nwas come to seek him. But, as he watched the figure, he observed its\r\npeculiar movement, rather floating than walking up the nave, enveloped\r\nin its sweeping draperies, and as it passed he heard a low musical voice\r\nlike a wiffling wind which said, ‘Is there no good Christian who will\r\nsay a mass for my poor soul?’ and the figure passed on swiftly, on\r\nbehind the altar, and did not return.\r\n\r\n“Through an hour the Knight of Malta sat watching and expecting, and\r\nthen, as the clock struck one, the figure again floated up the nave, and\r\nagain the same sad low voice murmured, ‘Is there no good Christian will\r\nsay a mass for my poor soul?’ Then the Knight came out of the\r\nconfessional and pursued the vanishing figure, pursued it to a\r\nparticular spot behind the altar, where it disappeared altogether.\r\n\r\n“When the clock struck two, the figure appeared again, and when it again\r\nuttered the words, ‘Will no good Christian say a mass for my poor soul?’\r\nthe priest-soldier answered, ‘I will; but you must serve the mass,’ for\r\nthere can be no mass without a server. The holy vessels were upon the\r\naltar, and the soldier-priest began the mass. Then the monk threw back\r\nhis cowl and displayed a skull, but he served the mass, which the priest\r\ncourageously went through to the end: then he fell down unconscious in\r\nfront of the altar.\r\n\r\n“In the morning, when the monks came into the church, the stranger was\r\nfound still unconscious upon the altar steps. He was taken into the\r\nconvent, and, when he came to himself, he told what had happened. Great\r\nsearch was made in the archives of the monastery, though nothing was\r\nfound to account for it. But long after, when some repairs were being\r\nmade in the cathedral, the body of a monk in his robe and cowl was\r\nfound walled up, evidently for some crime, near the altar, just at the\r\nspot where the Knight had seen him vanish.”[338]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA railway took us from Palermo to Caldane, almost on the opposite coast,\r\nand there we were transferred to a wretched tumble-down diligence, which\r\nwent swinging and jolting over the deep pools in the rocky road. Though\r\nthere were no regular brigands on this road, the peasants, who were too\r\nidle to work, constantly formed themselves into great bands and attacked\r\nthe diligences; so the Sardinian Government, too feeble to attempt\r\nmanaging the people themselves, sent a guard to defend us from them. Two\r\nsoldiers with guns sat on the luggage, and loaded pistols peeped\r\nominously from under the cloaks of the Sicilians within, one of whom was\r\nan _impiégato per la caccia dei briganti_. However, late at night we\r\nreached Caltanisetta, a great poverty-stricken city, with white houses,\r\nwhite rocks, and no vegetation, high in the sulphur district.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATE OF MOLA.][339]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TARANTO.][340]\r\n\r\nOn going to the station the next morning, we heard that the railway near\r\nMessina was washed away, and that the last train had narrowly escaped a\r\nTay Bridge disaster by the breaking of the high bridge at Ali. So we\r\ntelegraphed to Taormina to send a carriage to meet us at Giardini, the\r\nplace nearest the scene of the disaster. We did not reach Giardini till\r\nit was pitch-dark; the sea was raging close to the railway, and the rain\r\nhad been falling all day in torrents. It was such a night as one\r\nscarcely ever sees, so tempestuous, so utterly black! There was no\r\ncarriage for us, and no one to meet us; the telegraph had been swept\r\naway in the storm. Blankly and grimly did the officials see the large\r\nparty deposited at the desolate station surrounded by waters, and great\r\nwas the consternation of my four female companions when they found that\r\nit was just going to be closed and abandoned. We got a man to wade\r\nthrough the marsh to Giardini to try to get a carriage to come to us:\r\nthe carriage tried, but an intercepting torrent was so swollen, it was\r\nimpossible for it to cross without being swept out to sea. The man came\r\nback along the railway parapet, and told us that we must give up all\r\nhope of getting away. The officials refused to send any one with us; no\r\none would face the furies of the night; nor could they lend us a\r\nlanthorn; they wanted it themselves. Happily I had made friends with a\r\nyoung man of Taormina--_capo della musica_--who happened to be at the\r\nstation. He had a lanthorn, and kindly waited for us, till at last my\r\ncompanions consented to kilt up their dresses and venture out into the\r\nblackness. It was four miles by the road, about a mile and half by the\r\nprecipices; we chose the latter. But the path through the precipices,\r\nwhich we had toiled up before in burning sunshine, was now a roaring\r\ntorrent. However, there was nothing for it but to plunge in absolute\r\nblackness from stone to stone of the steep ascent, holding on to the\r\nbroom and asphodels. At the most dangerous points the _capo della\r\nmusica_, who made the little joke of “Io _solo_ sono sole,” kindly\r\nwaited with his lanthorn till each of the party of eight was safely\r\nround the corner. Fortunately the rain almost ceased during the ascent,\r\nand at last, by scrambling, jumping, or grovelling, we found ourselves\r\nin the street of Taormina. The people of the inn were gone to bed, but\r\nsoon the great event of a large party with ladies arriving on such a\r\nterrific night caused many windows to open in the friendly primitive\r\nstreet, and heads and candles to appear: the hotel was roused, and we\r\nwere warmly welcomed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASTEL DEL MONTE.][341]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOMB OF BOHEMUND, CANOSA.][342]\r\n\r\nFor three days we remained in a state of siege with the elements howling\r\naround in our rock-fortress of Taormina, sometimes seeing Etna reveal\r\nitself above the black storm-clouds. Then we crossed to Reggio, and went\r\non by night to Taranto, where we spent the morning in drawing the\r\ncurious island-town, and took the train again to Trani. Hence we made\r\nan excursion--three hours in a carriage and one on foot--to Castel del\r\nMonte, the favourite castle of the great Frederick II., long since a\r\nruin, but not roofless, and presenting a more perfect picture of\r\nmediaeval splendour in its suites of marble halls than any castle I ever\r\nvisited. Yet it must always have been a most desolate place and the most\r\nuninteresting of royal residences. Trani itself is full of interest, and\r\nhas a beautiful cathedral. Accounts we had read of “the all-glorious\r\ncathedral of Andria” beguiled us to toil next to that old episcopal\r\ncity, which we found a complete delusion, and went on to Barletta,\r\nvisiting thence the battlefield of Cannae and the curious old town of\r\nCanosa, where Ariosto’s hero Bohemund is buried. Then we proceeded to\r\nFoggia, where we saw the remains of Frederick II.’s palace, and thence\r\nwe made another excursion to his favourite town of Lucera, full of\r\nSaracenic remains. The next day we saw Beneventum, another glorious\r\ncathedral, mosque, and a grand Roman gateway, and arrived at Naples on\r\nthe 12th of February. My last days with my companions were spent at\r\nbeautiful Amalfi, and after a few lovely days at Naples and Rome, I\r\nfollowed them to England.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Elton Hall, Peterborough, April 1, 1880._--I have been two days here\r\nat Lord Carysfort’s.... The house is a jumble of architecture of every\r\nstyle and age, from Henry VII. to the present, and, without ever being\r\nvery picturesque, is thoroughly satisfactory and comfortable, with a\r\ndelightful library and a number of fine portraits. The park overlooks\r\nlong lines of flat, amid which rises Fotheringhay Church. An old\r\nwatermill is called ‘Pereo Mill,’ because when Mary Queen of Scots\r\narrived and saw all the waters out, as they so often are to this day,\r\nshe thought all was over with her and exclaimed, ‘Pereo,’--I perish. We\r\nhave driven to Fotheringhay, and seen again the mound and the one\r\nremaining stone of the castle. The church is like a lanthorn, so full of\r\nwindows, and very fine, though perpendicular. By the altar are tombs\r\nwith stately inscriptions on the wall over them to Richard and Cicely\r\nPlantagenet, father and mother of Edward IV., and to his grandfather\r\nEdward Plantagenet, who was killed in the battle of Agincourt. We went\r\non to Oundle, a charming old town with a noble church. Here, in the\r\nstreet, is the house of Lord and Lady Lyveden, with a large garden on\r\nthe other side. The two Lady Lyvedens were there. The old one, Lord\r\nCastletown’s sister, was once the beautiful little girl of Sir T.\r\nLawrence’s masterpiece; the younger, a plain, simple, sensible woman,\r\nwell fitted for a poor peer’s wife, is perfectly adored in the town of\r\nOundle.\r\n\r\n“Sir Frederick Peel is here with his young wife, who is charming, so\r\nvery pretty, with quantities to say on all subjects.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_St. James’s Place, May 8._--To Mrs. Stewart’s. Lord Houghton was\r\nthere, very cheery and kind. I was struck the other day by hearing some\r\none say, ‘Lord Houghton is not only a friend in poverty, he is a friend\r\nin _disgrace_.’ Can there be higher praise? He was very amusing apropos\r\nof my employing Henningham and Holles to leave my cards, and said that\r\nMiss Martineau at first absolutely refused to conform to the ways of the\r\nworld in paying visits, it was ‘such a waste of time;’ but it was\r\nsuggested to her that she should send out ‘an inferior authoress’ with\r\nher trumpet in a hackney-coach to represent her and do her work, and\r\nthat if the authoress only let the trumpet appear out of the\r\ncoach-window, she would do just as well as herself.\r\n\r\n“Dined at Lord Sherborne’s, meeting, amongst others, Lady Powerscourt,\r\nsurely one of the sweetest of God’s creatures.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 13._--Having heard of George Paul’s death, I went to see\r\nAuntie.[343] It was strange to find the familiar figure of my childhood,\r\nwho had been inexplicably separated from me for twelve years, and with\r\nher to see again many of the silent objects connected with Esmeralda and\r\nthose sealed chapters of life. We spoke only on indifferent subjects,\r\nbut I cannot think poor Auntie can have felt indifferent, though she\r\nrefused to show me the slightest affection, or evince the least pleasure\r\nat seeing me.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 15._--I paid £50 into Auntie’s account at Coutts’s, and shall\r\ncontinue to do so at this date annually.

Mrs. Stewart was there.\r\nSome one said Sir William Harcourt’s late election failure would be as\r\ngood as a dose of physic to him--‘No,’ she answered, ‘it will be no good\r\nat all; it has been a dose of castor-oil administered to a marble\r\nstatue.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 25._--Luncheon at Lady Sherborne’s. Dear old Mrs. Stewart was\r\nthere in great force, and recited Swinburne’s really grand lines apropos\r\nof the Prince Imperial’s proposed monument, exhorting the illustrious\r\ndead to veil their faces and leave Westminster Abbey on the arrival of\r\nhis statue.\r\n\r\n“Lady Airlie was at luncheon. She spoke of the almost necessity for a\r\ncloud over the most beautiful lives. She said how one might observe that\r\nin almost all the finest summer days the sun was clouded over for some\r\nhours.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 26._--Dined at the Thorntons’. Lord Houghton was there. He said\r\nhow he had discussed with George Sand the question how far it was well\r\nto know authors whose works you admired. She had urged him never to know\r\nthem, that they all put their best into their books; whatever you find\r\nafterwards can only be inferior material. Carlyle, Lord Houghton\r\nallowed, was just like his books; in his case you could know the man and\r\nnot be disappointed: it is the same mixture of grim humour, irony, and\r\npathos, of which his books are composed, which enables the man\r\npersonally to produce such an indescribable impression. Carlyle always\r\nhated having his picture taken, but was persuaded to sit to Millais.\r\nWhen he went there, to the beautiful house full of priceless\r\nart-treasures, he asked what brought them there. ‘My art,’ answered\r\nMillais proudly. ‘Then there are more fools in the world than I\r\nimagined,’ said Carlyle.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 30._--Sat a long time with Lady Airlie, who talked of the power\r\nof prayer and the number of people who really believed in it. She said\r\nshe prayed for everything, but always left it to God to decide for her,\r\nmaking a complete act of submission, but adding, ‘I should _like_ this\r\nor that best.’ The mystic Mr. Laurence Oliphant came in and talked for a\r\nlong time. Being asked as to his past and future, he said he could only\r\nact ‘under direction,’ _i.e._, of spirits. He said the separation from\r\nthe spiritual world was entirely dependent upon the constitution of the\r\nindividual. No wonder that the hallucinations of this brilliant and\r\nfascinating visionary wreck the comfort as well as the practical\r\nusefulness at once of his own life and the lives of those dearest to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“A few days ago Ronald Gower came and took me to Frank Miles’s studio--a\r\nnew-old house in Tite Street, Chelsea.

He paints all the\r\n‘professional beauties,’ who hover round him and his studio like moths,\r\nbut his pictures have no great power.”[344]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 31._--I was at Stafford House in the evening, the hall brilliantly\r\nlighted, a deafening band on the staircase, and all the\r\nCampbell-Percy-Gower connection looking on.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 1._--I dined with the Boynes, and went afterwards to Lady Sudeley\r\nand Mrs. Cavendish Bentinck.

Mr. Bouverie was there, and very\r\nentertaining with stories of the old Duke of Wellington, of whom he\r\njustly said that his character had greatly risen through the publication\r\nof his letters, while other characters had been lowered. ‘They will\r\nknock down a great many statues,’ the Duke had said in speaking of them\r\nto Mr. Bouverie in his lifetime.\r\n\r\n“Apropos of the Duke’s love of military discipline, Mr. Bouverie\r\nmentioned how, when he was at Walmer, all the officers of the\r\nneighbouring garrison called except Lord Douro, who thought it would be\r\nabsurd, as he was seeing his father every day. Consequently, the Duke\r\nasked all the officers to dinner except his own son, and at dinner said\r\nto the Colonel, ‘By-the-bye, who is your Major? for he has not called on\r\nme.’\r\n\r\n“Another example of the Duke’s character as a martinet was that Lord\r\nDouro once met him in plain clothes. The Duke took no notice of him\r\nwhatever. Lord Douro, knowing how angry his father must be, rushed in,\r\nchanged his clothes for uniform, and met his father again. ‘Hallo,\r\nDouro! how are you? it is a long time since I have seen you,’ said the\r\nDuke; but he had seen him quite well a quarter of an hour before.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 10._--Dined with the Miss Duff Gordons, meeting Tosti the singer\r\nand tall young Carlo Orsi from one of the old _castelli_ in the Tuscan\r\nvalley of Signa. He was very naïve about his coming to London, and his\r\nasking himself when he woke, ‘And can it be thou, Carlo, who art here?’\r\nMrs. Caulfield (_née_ Crampton[346]) and Tosti sang exquisitely in the\r\nevening.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 14._--With Mrs. Stewart to Alma Tadema’s studio--a small house on\r\nthe north of the Regent’s Park. Inside it is a labyrinth of small rooms\r\nwith gilt walls and ceilings, and doors hung with quaint draperies. A\r\nvague light fell through alabaster windows upon Madame Tadema in a cloth\r\nof gold dress backed by violet draperies. The Dutch artist, her husband,\r\nthinks her red hair glorious, and introduces her in all his pictures. In\r\nhis studio is a strange picture of ‘The Triumph of Death’ by Breughel\r\nthe Devil. I was glad to meet again Madame Riaño--Doña Emilia de\r\nGuyangos--gliding through the half-dark rooms after the ubiquitous wife\r\nof Tom Hughes.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 15._--Luncheon with Lady Dorothy Nevill in her charming house in\r\nCharles Street, which has all the attractions of an old manor. Lady\r\nDorothy is very pretty still, like a piece of Dresden china. She and\r\nLord Houghton were very amusing over Mr. Wolff,[347] who married her\r\naunt, Lady Georgiana. Nothing could persuade him to cleanliness. Once\r\nthey tried to insist upon his washing his hands, and took him to a jug,\r\nbasin, and clean towel for the purpose, but he would only dip the ends\r\nof his fingers in the jug and dry them on his pocket-handkerchief. If he\r\nwent to stay anywhere, he would never take any luggage. He was, however,\r\npersuaded for three days to take three clean shirts, but he arrived with\r\nthem all _on_, and peeled gradually.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Wolff went to stay with George Anthony Denison, who was frightfully\r\nbored with him. He stayed a week. As he was in the carriage going off\r\nfrom the door, Mr. Denison said to him, ‘Well, good-bye, my dear fellow;\r\nI’m sorry you’re going.’--‘Are you sorry I’m going?’ said a gruff voice\r\nfrom the carriage; ‘then I’ll stay another week.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 16._--A huge party at Devonshire House--the staircase most\r\nbeautiful.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 17._--To Lady Airlie to meet Miss Farrer and Emmeline Erskine--a\r\nlong talk quietly about spirituality and the Quietists. Miss Farrer told\r\nme first-hand a story I have often heard before:--\r\n\r\n“Her brother knew well a shopkeeper in Plymouth, who felt one day, he\r\ncould not tell why, that he must go to Bodmin. To get there, it was\r\nnecessary that he should cross a ferry. It was late at night, and he\r\nexpected to have great difficulty in getting across, but, to his\r\namazement, he found the boat ready for him. The ferryman said, ‘I am\r\nready, because you called me an hour ago.’\r\n\r\n“When the shopkeeper reached Bodmin, the town was full of crowds and\r\nconfusion; the assizes were going on. He made his way to the court. A\r\nman was being tried for murder, and likely to be condemned. He protested\r\nhis innocence in vain, and in an agony was just saying, ‘I was in\r\nPlymouth at the time, if I could only prove it.’ The shopkeeper was just\r\nin time to hear him, and exclaim, ‘I can prove it, my Lord; I remember\r\nthe prisoner perfectly: he came into my shop at the very time in\r\nquestion.’ And it saved the man’s life.\r\n\r\n“Emmeline told of Mr. Richmond’s little children, who, playing in a long\r\nalmost dark gallery, saw their dead mother standing at the end, and went\r\nto their father and told him, ‘Mama is come back.’ An open cistern was\r\nfound at the spot where they had seen her.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 18._--Dined with the Owen Grants. At ninety-three old Lord\r\nKilmorey is dying. He took his immense drives as usual till a few days\r\nago. Then, returning from one of them, he sent for George Higginson and\r\nOwen Grant, and said, ‘Now I am going to die; I think it is time, and I\r\nwish you to stay with me to the end.’ They sent for the doctor, who\r\npersistently declared that Lord Kilmorey had nothing whatever the matter\r\nwith him. They remonstrated as to the pain it would give to many.\r\n‘Well,’ he said, ‘yes, my sister Georgiana, perhaps she will feel it; I\r\nwill wait till I have seen her.’ And he waited till he had seen old Lady\r\nGeorgiana, talked to her very affectionately, took leave of her, and\r\nsince then has eaten nothing.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 20._--Lord Kilmorey died to-day.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 24._--With the Mark Woods to Charlton, the fine old house of Sir\r\nThomas Maryon Wilson, near Greenwich. It was built by James I. for his\r\nson Prince Henry, and is in wonderful keeping with its surroundings of\r\nbroad terraces, old pine-trees, &c. In the richly polished chimney-piece\r\nof one of the rooms, a lady while dressing is said to have seen a murder\r\nreflected while it was being committed in the park, and her evidence to\r\nhave found the man guilty.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 26._--In the evening I was at the Speaker’s party. His beautiful\r\nrooms were additionally illuminated by the glare from a great fire on\r\nthe opposite bank of the river. The bridge, and the chain of omnibuses\r\nand cabs, with their roofs crowded with the black figures of spectators,\r\nand the background of flames, gave the whole scene the aspect of the\r\nDevil’s funeral with appropriate fireworks. In a great hooded car,\r\nnodding against the flame, the Devil’s widow seemed to follow. We\r\nwatched from the windows for nearly two hours--inside, bright uniforms,\r\nlow dresses, glistening diamonds: outside, flames and a black shimmering\r\nriver. At last the fire-engines got the victory, a roof fell in, the\r\nglare began to fade, the bereaved demons returned from the ceremony, and\r\nthe illuminations were extinguished. No human life was lost, only the\r\ntwo great bloodhounds which were the guards of the timber-yard, and\r\nwhich for years have gained the prize in every dog-show.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 29._--Lady Lucy Grant had a pleasant party in her pretty garden.\r\nOld Madame Mohl was there, a wreck, but a curious reminiscence of the\r\npast. In the little garden-studio Miss Grant’s reredos for Edinburgh\r\nCathedral was lighted up. In the main features it is fine, but the women\r\nare all exactly the same height as the men, and all the figures stand in\r\na line, with an equal amount of individuality, too little occupied with\r\neach other.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 7._--Dinner at Lord Ducie’s. I was delighted to sit once more by\r\nMadame de Riaño[348] and enjoy the flow of her ever-fresh originality.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 8._--The Duchess of Norfolk’s ball. The house had not been opened\r\nto a great party for forty years, but the noble suite of rooms, with\r\ntheir old ceilings and pictures, is well adapted for it.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 9._--Lord Denbigh has sent me what he calls ‘a bundle of\r\nwonders.’ It contains one curious history related by Henry Malet in\r\nAugust 1869.\r\n\r\n“‘In the winter of 1854-55, at the end of December, I was in Paris, and\r\namong other people of whom I saw a good deal was Palgrave Simpson, the\r\ndramatic author. There was something about him I liked, and a certain\r\noriginality in the tone of his mind interested me. One evening, after a\r\nbachelors’ dinner at Charlie Webster’s rooms, the conversation turned on\r\nclairvoyance. Palgrave Simpson expressed himself a believer in many of\r\nthe clairvoyant phenomena which were then astonishing people in Paris,\r\nbut nearly all the rest of us, except myself, laughed in his face, and\r\ntold him that he must be insane to credit such nonsense. He and I walked\r\nhome together, and I believe that I told him I should be glad of an\r\nopportunity of investigating some of the stories which had impressed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“‘Within a few days I received a sudden order to return at once to\r\nLondon and hold myself in readiness to embark for the Crimea with a\r\nlarge detachment of my regiment.\r\n\r\n“‘Our departure was delayed from day to day, but about the end of March\r\nit was fixed for the first week in April. When the day was finally\r\nsettled, I prevailed on my mother, who was in despair at the idea of my\r\ngoing on active service, to leave London with my brother and go to\r\nFrankfort, as I concluded that the actual blow of the separation would\r\nbe lessened by this means.\r\n\r\n“‘I am not quite positive as to the date of our sailing, but it was two\r\nor three days after my mother arrived at Frankfort.\r\n\r\n“‘We were to parade in Wellington Barracks at 5 A.M., and, after\r\nmidnight on the last night, I looked in at the Guards Club, and found\r\nthere a note enclosing an antique ring. The note was from Palgrave\r\nSimpson and said, “Do not laugh at me, but while you are in the Crimea\r\nwear the enclosed ring. It was given to me by the last representative of\r\nan old Hungarian family on her death-bed. In her family it was an\r\nheirloom, and considered as a most precious talisman to preserve the\r\nwearer from any external harm.”\r\n\r\n“‘I slipped the ring on my finger, I must own, without attaching any\r\ngreat importance to the matter, and turned in, after writing Palgrave\r\nSimpson a note to thank him for his kindness.\r\n\r\n“‘The next morning I sailed at 10 A.M. from Portsmouth. We touched at\r\nGibraltar, but it was not till our arrival at Malta that I heard from my\r\nfamily. Then I found a letter from my mother dated from Frankfort on the\r\nvery day of our sailing from England. It said, “I have been quite\r\nbroken-hearted about you, and could find no comfort anywhere; but now\r\nall is changed, for a most extraordinary reason. This morning, as I lay\r\nin bed in broad daylight, and after my maid had brought my hot water,\r\njust as I was about to get up, a most beautiful young lady, very fair,\r\nand dressed in grey silk, drew aside the curtain of my bed and leant\r\nover me and said, ‘Do not be unhappy about your son: no harm shall\r\nhappen to him.’ I am quite certain I have had a vision, yet it seemed as\r\nif I were awake: certainly I was so the moment before this happened. The\r\nwhole thing is as distinct as possible, and as unlike an effect of\r\nimagination. Of course I cannot account for it, but it has made me quite\r\nhappy, and I _know_ you will come back safe.”\r\n\r\n“‘On receipt of this letter I bethought me of the ring, and begged my\r\nmother in reply to describe minutely the appearance of the mysterious\r\nvisitor. My mother said it was a young woman about twenty-seven years of\r\nage, rather pale, with very straight features, large grey eyes, and an\r\nabundance of brown hair worn in rather an old-fashioned manner: the\r\nsleeves of the grey silk dress were what we call “bishop sleeves.”\r\n\r\n“‘I sent copies of my mother’s letters to Palgrave Simpson, and he\r\nanswered me that the description was in the _minutest_ particular the\r\ncounterpart of the lady who on her death-bed had given him the ring some\r\nsixteen or seventeen years before.\r\n\r\n“‘It is to be observed that no communication whatever passed between me\r\nand my mother between the receipt of the ring and my arrival at Malta,\r\nand I will swear that I told no one the story.\r\n\r\n“‘On my return from the Crimea I restored the ring to its owner, but he\r\nsent it back to me, begging me to keep it. Last year he wrote to me that\r\nhe was threatened by a certain danger, and he wished to have back the\r\ntalisman. I at once returned it to him, and it is now in his hands.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 10._--Dining at Louisa, Lady Ashburton’s, I sat near George N.\r\nCurzon, eldest son of Lord Scarsdale, the sort of fellow I take to at\r\nonce, and we made great friends in one evening, unfolding ourselves in a\r\nway which makes me sure we shall meet again.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 11._--Dined at Lord Foley’s. George Russell was there. He said he\r\nhad said something about Lord Salisbury’s carriage to the Duchess\r\nDowager of Cleveland. ‘I did not know Lord Salisbury had a carriage,’\r\nsaid the old lady. ‘Surely, my dear Duchess?’--‘No; I have even heard it\r\nsaid that the present Marquis of Salisbury goes about in a vehicle\r\ncalled a brougham!’\r\n\r\n“Sir Robert and Lady Sheffield were going down to visit some friends\r\nnear West Drayton, where a carriage was to meet them. Arriving in the\r\ndark, they found a carriage waiting and jumped into it. After driving\r\nsome way, they entered a park and drove up to the door of a great house.\r\nThey were shown up to a long gallery, where a little old lady was\r\narranging some books. ‘Ah! some companion,’ they thought, and for a time\r\nthey took no notice of her. At last they said, ‘Is Lady ---- not coming\r\ndown soon?’--‘I am not cognisant of the movements of my Lady ----,’ said\r\nthe old lady very sharply, rapping her ebony stick violently on the\r\nfloor; ‘but you are under a misapprehension. This is Osterley Park, and\r\nI--am the Duchess of Cleveland.’ And then subsiding into her most\r\ngracious manner,--‘And now, whilst my carriage is getting ready to take\r\nyou on to Lady ----, I hope you will allow me to have the pleasure of\r\ngiving you some tea.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 14._--Dinner at Lady Charlemont’s. Mr. Synge, who declared at\r\nonce his belief in ghostly apparitions, told a pretty story of a\r\nclergyman in Somersetshire who had ridden to the bank and drawn out all\r\nthe money for his poor-club, which he was taking back with him, when he\r\nbecame aware of another horseman riding by his side, who did not speak,\r\nand who, at a certain point of the road beyond a hollow, disappeared. In\r\nthat hollow highwaymen, who knew the clergyman was coming with the\r\nmoney, were waiting to attack him; but they refrained, ‘for there are\r\ntwo of them,’ they said. It was his guardian angel.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Synge told us that his grandfather was the magistrate to whom the\r\nman came who said that he ought to warn Mr. Percival because he had\r\ntwice dreamt of a man in a white plush coat with purple glass buttons\r\nwho was going to murder him. But his grandfather restrained the man from\r\nsaying anything on so slight a foundation as a dream. After the murder\r\nof Mr. Percival, the man went up to London, and in the prisoner in\r\nNewgate recognised at once the man he had seen, and found him wearing\r\nthe white plush coat with the purple glass buttons.\r\n\r\n“Lady Charlemont talked much of the Lord Chancellor Thurlow. He asked\r\nfor the Bishopric of Durham for his brother. George IV. replied that he\r\nthought Lord Thurlow should have known that that Bishopric, being a\r\nprincipality, could only be given to persons of the very highest rank\r\nand connections. ‘It is therefore, your Majesty,’ said Lord Thurlow,\r\n‘that I have asked for it for the brother of the Lord High Chancellor of\r\nEngland.’\r\n\r\n“A clergyman desirous of a living went to the Bishop of London and asked\r\nhim for an introduction to the Lord Chancellor Thurlow. The Bishop said,\r\n‘I should be willing to give it, but an introduction from me would\r\ndefeat the very end you have in view.’ However, the clergyman persisted\r\nin his request, and the introduction was given.\r\n\r\n“The Lord Chancellor received him with fury. ‘So that damned scoundrel\r\nthe Bishop of London has given you an introduction: as it is he who has\r\nintroduced you, you will certainly not get the living.’--‘Well, so the\r\nBishop said, my lord,’ replied the clergyman. ‘Did the Bishop say so?’\r\nthundered Lord Thurlow: ‘then he’s a damned liar, and I’ll prove him so:\r\nyou _shall_ have the living,’ and the man got it.\r\n\r\n“At Arundel the guests were astonished by the butler coming in one day\r\nabruptly and saying to the Duke, ‘May it please your Grace, Lord Thurlow\r\nhas laid an egg.’ It was one of the owls which existed at Arundel till\r\nthe time of the present owner. Lord Thurlow’s daughter, going round\r\ntheir cages in the wall, had stopped opposite one of them, and, looking\r\nat the blinking bird, said, ‘Why, he’s just like papa.’ The bird was\r\never after called Lord Thurlow.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 16._--At Mrs. Ralph Dutton’s I took Mrs. Procter in to\r\ndinner--Barry Cornwall’s widow, always full of interest and excellence,\r\nand of many unknown kindnesses. She talked of her early days, of the\r\ncharm of Monckton Milnes when young--his brightness and vigour: of the\r\ndecadence of society now, when at least a thousand persons were invited\r\nto Grosvenor House whom our grandmothers would not consent to be in the\r\nsame room with; but that society now required high seasoning, and\r\nroyalty the strongest pepper of all: that in former days no guest would\r\nhave continued in a house where he was received on entering by a wet\r\nsponge from ----: that the abbreviation of P. B.’s in use for\r\n‘professional beauties’ was a sign of the depth to which we have fallen.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Stewart told me a characteristic story of Mrs. Procter’s wit. ‘The\r\nLionel Tennysons--dear good excellent people--asked that woman Sarah\r\nBernhardt, the actress, to luncheon, asked her to go all the way to them\r\nin Kensington, and invited some good, quiet, simple folk to meet her,\r\njust trusting in his prestige as the laureate’s son. I need hardly say\r\nthat, though they waited luncheon for Sarah Bernhardt till four o’clock,\r\nshe never came. She knew the company she was to meet, and she did not\r\nthink it worth while. They told Mrs. Procter of it. ‘Why,’ she said, ‘if\r\npeople will invite monkeys, they must provide them with _nuts_.’\r\n\r\n“‘Dear Mrs. Procter is so satirical,’ says Mrs. Stewart, ‘that when I go\r\nto her and find other people in the room, I always stay till the last,\r\nthat she may have no one to discuss me with.’\r\n\r\n“When Mrs. Procter dies, her last daughter will probably go into a\r\nconvent. She has had three daughters; two have become Roman Catholics,\r\nand one is already in a convent. ‘I have another daughter, but you will\r\nnever see her,’ is the only way in which the mother alludes to this.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 17._--Sat by Matthew Arnold at breakfast. Speaking of the odd\r\neffect misspelt words often produced, he quoted a begging letter he had\r\njust received from a lady who said she had a decided claim upon charity,\r\nbeing ‘the sole support of an aged Ant’ (_sic_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. DUNCAN STEWART]\r\n\r\n“Called on Mrs. Stewart. She said that the evening before she had asked\r\nMr. Froude what she should reply to Mr. Tennyson if he asked her what\r\nshe thought of his last wretched poems. ‘Oh, say, “Blessed sir, would I\r\npresume?”’ returned Mr. Froude.\r\n\r\n“Two days ago I went to Lady Airlie’s, where a large party was collected\r\nto hear Mr. Browning read. I never heard any one, even a child of ten,\r\nread so atrociously. It was two of his own poems--‘Good News to Ghent’\r\nand ‘Ivan Ivanowitch,’ the latter always most horrible and unsuitable\r\nfor reading aloud, but in this case rendered utterly unintelligible by\r\nthe melodramatic vocal contortions of the reader.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 23._--By invitation of Mrs. Stephen Winkworth to see Lewis\r\nCampbell’s translation of the ‘Agamemnon’ acted. Mrs. Fleeming Jenkin\r\ntook the parts of both Clytemnestra and Cassandra, and was very grand in\r\nboth, especially the latter. She has an infinity of action, but it is\r\nall graceful and very Greek. The chorus loses much, because each of the\r\nold men is made to say his speech separately, whereas in the original\r\nGreek they evidently all talked together.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 24, Milford._--I have ended a very happy season by leaving London\r\nimmediately after the marriage of Evelyn Bromley Davenport with Tom Legh\r\nof Lyme. Here, at Mrs. Greville’s, I find Lady Archibald Campbell, a\r\npale, beautiful young woman, strangely occupied with spiritualism, and\r\nMr. Watts, one of the principal writers in the _Athenæum_, and the man\r\nwho, living with Swinburne, has, by his personal influence, cured him of\r\nthe habit of drinking.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 25._--A hot Sunday afternoon, spent chiefly in sitting on the\r\nterrace, where great orange-trees are set in tubs as in a French garden,\r\nand in listening to the discursive conversation of Mr. Watts and Lady\r\nArchie about Swinburne and Rossetti.\r\n\r\n“I am very sorry, now that it is too late, that, in my last visit here,\r\nwhen asked to choose which I would be taken to see, I did not say George\r\nEliot instead of Tennyson. Mrs. Greville went to see her with an aching\r\nheart after Lewes’s death, and ‘found them all in the drawing-room\r\nplaying battledore and shuttlecock, nothing changed but the man.’\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Greville’s mother, sweet Mrs. Thellusson, was one of the claimants\r\nfor the great Thellusson fortune--an unsuccessful claimant. She is\r\nlovely still in her old age. Mrs. Greville has a picture of a young man\r\nin a dress of the beginning of this century. She described his return\r\nlately from India. ‘He came to Milford, and paid me endless attentions\r\nand made me endless presents; I really thought he wished to marry me,\r\nuntil he proposed to--my mother!’”[349]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Ammerdown Park, August 2._--I have been several days with Lady\r\nWaterford--always charming, always so full of holy teaching, that she\r\nrecalls the closing lines of St. Patrick’s Hymn--\r\n\r\n    ‘Christ in every eye that sees me,\r\n     Christ in every ear that hears me.’\r\n\r\nYet this visit leaves nothing especially to remember except a story of\r\nLord Waterford pursuing a robber who had broken into his house, finding\r\nhim in a public-house some four miles off, and convicting him amongst a\r\nnumber of other men by insisting upon feeling all their hearts; the man\r\nwhose heart was still beating quickly was the one who had just done\r\nrunning.\r\n\r\n“On Saturday I came to Wells, the lovely old city of orchards and clear\r\nrunning brooks, whence Lord Hylton fetched me to Ammerdown. Sir Augustus\r\nPaget and all his family are here, the daughter a lovely, bright,\r\nnatural girl,[350] and the sons, Victor and Ralph, most charming,\r\nkind-hearted, winning fellows. We have been to Mells--an overgrown park\r\nwith pretty natural features, which was the favourite manor of the Abbot\r\nof Glastonbury. At the dissolution, Mr. Horner was sent to take up the\r\nparchments of the abbatial lands to Windsor, and for better security\r\ntook them in a pasty. On the way he put in his thumb and pulled out for\r\nhimself the title-deeds of Mells, the best plum of all, which has ever\r\nsince remained in the family of ‘Little Jack Horner.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Ryde, Oct. 10._--I have spent a quiet, peaceful summer: so little from\r\nthe outer world seems to ruffle me now, and the storms of four terrible\r\nyears have been succeeded by six years of calm. It has been a constant\r\npleasure to visit the dear Mrs. Grove, now confined to the upper floor\r\nof her house. Charlotte Leycester has been long at Holmhurst, and other\r\nguests have come and gone, relics from my dearest Mother’s life, and\r\nwaifs and strays from my own, by many of whom I am sadly overrated; the\r\nmoral of which is, I suppose, that one should try really to clamber up\r\nto that high shelf on which one is placed in imagination. Of original\r\nwork I have done little enough, except one article on ‘Lucca’ for _Good\r\nWords_.\r\n\r\n“One of my chief occupations has been editing the life of the nun Amalie\r\nvon Lassaux, translated from the German by Fräulein von Weling. As\r\n‘Sister Augustine,’ her story possesses that interest which is always\r\nattached to a struggle in the cause of truth amid many persecutions and\r\ntorments, rather mental than physical.\r\n\r\n“I was away twice for a few days--first with young Mrs. Hamilton Seymour\r\nat Aylesford, a charming little old town on the sluggish Medway, with\r\n‘The Friars’ close by, where pleasant Lady Aylesford lives in a\r\nbeautiful old house, with oak staircase, gateway, water-gate, clipped\r\nyew-trees and terraces. Then I was two days at Hampton Court with witty\r\nold Lady Lyndhurst, and greatly delighted in the glories of the old\r\npalace and its gardens. And now I am with dear old George Liddell,[351]\r\nenjoying this otherwise dull watering-place through his genial\r\nhospitality.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Melchet, Hants, Oct. 23._--From Ryde I went to Amesbury to stay with\r\nSir Edmund and Lady Antrobus, who are some of the kindest and most\r\nhospitable people in London, and have a fine house in Piccadilly. Their\r\nhouse in Wiltshire is very fine too, though it has never been finished.\r\nGay’s Duchess of Queensberry lived there, and in the grounds are a cave\r\nand summer-house where the poet wrote verses to her. But the great\r\ninterest of Amesbury lies in its being the scene of Guinevere’s penance,\r\nand it recalls Tennyson’s poem in the swirling mists which arise with\r\nmorning and evening. Each morning we drew at Stonehenge amongst the\r\nhoary and mighty stones standing out against the ethereal lights and\r\nshadows of the plain.\r\n\r\n“Next, I went to Rushmore, to which the Lane Fox’s have succeeded, with\r\nthe name of Pitt Rivers and £36,000 a year, since the death of the 6th\r\nLord Rivers. It is a dull country-house on Cranbourne Chase--swooping\r\nmoors sprinkled with thorn-trees or thick woods of hazel. I was taken to\r\nsee Shaftesbury; Cranbourne, the fine old house of the Salisburys; and\r\nWardour, with noble cedars too closely overhanging the ruins of its\r\ncastle. Lord Arundel lives in the Park at Wardour, in an immense house\r\nwhich he is too poor to keep in repair. He has another place somewhere\r\nnear the sea, where his grandfather went to reside, to the great\r\ndiscomfiture of a gang of smugglers, who had previously had sole\r\npossession, and who tried to frighten him away by ghostly sights and\r\nsounds, but in vain. One night Lord Arundel was sitting in his room,\r\nhaving locked the door, when some one knocked. He demanded who was\r\nthere, when a voice said, ‘Open and you will see:’ He opened it, and\r\nfound a very rough-looking man with a keg of spirits under his arm. The\r\nman said, ‘Well, my Lord, we’ve done our best to frighten you, but you\r\nwon’t be frightened, so I’ve, come to make a clean breast of it, and\r\nI’ve brought you a little offering. I only hope you won’t be hard on\r\nus.’ ‘Oh, dear no, I won’t be hard on you,’ said Lord Arundel; and Lady\r\nMarian Alford, to whom he told the story at Rome when she was four years\r\nold, vividly remembers his vigorous assertion, ‘And the smuggler gave me\r\nthe very best Hollands I ever had in my life.’\r\n\r\n“From Rushmore, after a visit to the old Shipley home at Twyford, I came\r\nhere to Lady Ashburton. Melchet is a magnificent house in a beautiful\r\ncountry, and is filled with art-treasures of every kind. Lady Marian is\r\nhere, always pleasant with her ripple of conversation and anecdote. She\r\nhas been very amusing about her mother’s parrot, which used to hop about\r\nupon the lawn. One day it was carried off by an eagle. Old John Tooch,\r\none of the dynasty of John Toochs who worked in the garden, was mowing\r\nthe lawn, and as the parrot, in the eagle’s gripe, was sailing over his\r\nhead, he heard a voice in the air call out, ‘We’re ridin’ noo, John\r\nTooch, we’re ridin’ noo;’ at which strange sound the eagle was so\r\ndreadfully frightened that he let the parrot fall, so that John Tooch\r\ntook it home to its cage again.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Melchet, Oct. 28._--Yesterday we went to Longford--Lord Radnor’s--a\r\ngreat castellated house in a dull park, with no view, but very fine\r\npictures.\r\n\r\n“In the morning the (Melchet) footman woke me with the news that the\r\nhouse had been broken into. The robbers had entered through the\r\ndrawing-room window, perambulated the lower apartments, drunk up all the\r\nwine in the dining-room, and found all the valuables too big to carry\r\noff!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 29._--A charming visit to Broadlands, Lord Mount-Temple’s--the\r\npeople so full of genial goodness, the house most comfortable and\r\ngardens lovely. Lady Mount-Temple--in whom, as Miss Tollemache, Ruskin\r\nsaw such statuesque severity with womanly sweetness joined--a marvellous\r\nunion of beauty, goodness, and intelligence. The grounds, with fountain,\r\nriver, well-grouped trees, and a Palladian summer-house, are like a\r\nbeautiful Claude-Lorraine picture. The same landscape--of a river,\r\nwinding amongst cedar-shadowed lawns--forms the predella to Rossetti’s\r\npicture of ‘The Blessed Damozel.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Nov. 13._--Mr. and Mrs. Paterson have been here for the\r\nday. He told me two stories:--\r\n\r\n“A lady was awoke in the night with the disagreeable sense of not being\r\nalone in the room, and soon felt a thud upon her bed. There was no doubt\r\nthat some one was moving to and fro in the room, and that hands were\r\nconstantly moving over her bed. She was so dreadfully frightened that at\r\nlast she fainted. When she came to herself, it was broad daylight, and\r\nshe found that the butler had walked in his sleep and had laid the table\r\nfor fourteen upon her bed.\r\n\r\n“A lunatic, who had escaped for some time from his asylum, was\r\neventually captured. When he came in and saw the keeper who was\r\naccustomed to take care of him, he said, ‘Well, I’ve been very much\r\noccupied since I went away: I’ve been occupied in being\r\nmarried.’--‘Well, and whom have you married?’ said the keeper. ‘Oh, I’ve\r\nmarried the Devil’s daughter.’--‘Well, I hope it’s a happy union?’--‘Oh,\r\nvery, thank you,’ said the lunatic; ‘only I don’t much like the old\r\npeople.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Nov. 24._--Last week I was for two days at Cambridge as the\r\nguest of Jock Wallop, the best and kindest of hosts, under whose popular\r\nauspices I saw the present undergraduate life to perfection. There is a\r\nmost charming set of fellows there now, all delighted to be young, and\r\nnot aiming at juvenile senility, as was the fashion in my day at\r\nOxford.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 16._--Several Midland county visits afford nothing to recollect.\r\nCertainly country-house visits are a lottery. One old lady said, ‘My\r\ndear, I _am_ so glad to see you. It is so delightful to see any one _at\r\nall_ pleasant. In London one can have any agreeable company one likes,\r\nbut you know God Almighty fills one’s house in the country.’\r\n\r\n“I have, however, been to George Curzon at Oxford. He is most\r\ndelightful, and sure to become distinguished. At the meeting of the\r\nConservative ‘Canning Club’ I heard a most capital paper on Ireland by\r\nyoung Edward Arnold. Afterwards I was three days at Sherborne, meeting,\r\namongst other less interesting elements, the ever-charming Dowager Lady\r\nCraven. Lady Sherborne sang in a way which would move the heart of a\r\nbasilisk. The country around Sherborne was the scene of innumerable\r\nbattles in Saxon times, commemorated in the names of the fields and\r\nfarms, which are supposed to owe their fertility to the carnage with\r\nwhich they had been covered. This supposition makes the peasants eager\r\nfor the use of bone-dust, which they believe to be imported from the\r\nplains of Waterloo. If a field, after having been thus manured, still\r\nyields no crop, they say ‘Waterloo bean’t no use here!’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI spent the Christmas of 1880 again with the kind Lowthers at Ampthill,\r\nmeeting, as before, Louisa, Lady Ashburton, and going, as before, to\r\nspend a day at Woburn. In January 1881 I was at Bretton with the\r\nBeaumonts, meeting Julia, Lady Jersey, and a large party.\r\n\r\nWe went to see Nostell, a very grand but little known house of the\r\nWinns, full of splendid things, glorious tapestries, china, Chippendale\r\nfurniture, but, most remarkable of all, a doll’s house of the last\r\ncentury, with miniature fairy furniture, exquisitely carved and painted,\r\na doll trousseau with point lace, and a Liliputian service of plate.\r\n\r\nWe also went a long drive to Stainborough (Wentworth Castle), through a\r\ncountry which may be pretty in summer clearness, but which is hideously\r\nblack in winter. The house is a great Italian palace, half Queen Anne,\r\nhalf older, with little temples in the grounds, the building of one of\r\nwhich is described by Evelyn. Inside there are fine tapestries, and many\r\npictures of the Stuarts, ascribed to Vandyck, but probably copies. Lady\r\nHarriet Wentworth, who showed us everything herself, gave us the\r\ncharacteristic of her life when she said “I do so hate the _thraldom_ of\r\ncivilisation.” Her stately rooms have no charm for her, and, though they\r\nare so immense, she declares she cannot breathe in them, and she lives\r\nentirely and has all her meals in the conservatory, with a damp, warm,\r\nmarshy climate, from which she does not scruple to emerge through the\r\nbitter winds of the Yorkshire wolds (for the conservatory does not join\r\nthe house) with nothing extra on. From Bretton I went to Tortworth--Lord\r\nDucie’s--in Gloucestershire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 11, 1881._--There is a large party here (at Tortworth), but one\r\nforgets all its other elements in dear Mrs. Duncan Stewart. ‘L’esprit\r\npétille sur son visage.’ Never was there a more marvellous coruscation\r\nof wit and wisdom; and she not merely evades ever saying an ill-natured\r\nthing of any one, but, where there is positively _nothing_ of good to be\r\nsaid, has some apt line of old poetry or some proverb to bring forward\r\nurging mercy--‘Mercy, so much grander than justice.’\r\n\r\n“Last night she wanted to introduce me to Mrs. Grey, an American lady\r\nwho is staying here. ‘I cannot do it better,’ she said, ‘than in the\r\nwords of Alfred d’Orsay when he brought up Landseer to me, saying,\r\n“Here, Mrs. Stewart, is Landseer, who can do everything better than he\r\ncan paint,”--so here, Mrs. Grey, is Mr. Hare, who can do everything\r\nbetter than he can write.’\r\n\r\n“To-day, at luncheon, Mrs. Stewart talked much of Paris, and of her\r\nintercourse with a French physician there. Dr. ---- spoke to her of the\r\nhappy despatch, and unhesitatingly allowed that when he saw a patient\r\ncondemned to hopeless suffering, he practised it. ‘But of course you\r\ninsist on the acquiescence both of the patients and of their families,’\r\nsaid Mrs. Stewart. ‘_Never_,’ shouted Dr. ----. ‘I should be a mean sneak\r\nindeed if I waited for _that_.’\r\n\r\n“She talked much of George Sand and of her journey to Italy, from which\r\nthree books resulted, _her’s_, ‘Elle et Lui:’ _his_, ‘Lui et Elle,’ and\r\n‘Lettres d’un Voyageur.’\r\n\r\n“She said his was most horrible.\r\n\r\n“Afterwards Lord ---- was in a box at the opera in Paris with a number of\r\nother young men. There was a knock at the door, and George Sand came in.\r\n‘Il y a place pour moi?’--‘Certainly,’ they said. By-and-by one of them\r\ninquired, ‘Et Musset?’--‘Oh, il voyage en Italie,’ she replied.\r\nPresently the door opened, and a man came in--haggard, dishevelled, worn\r\nto a degree. It was Musset. He shook hands with one and other of the\r\nyoung men. ‘Et pas un mot pour moi?’ said George Sand. ‘Non,’ he\r\nexclaimed. ‘Je vous haïs, je vous deteste! c’est que vous avez tué le\r\nbonheur de ma vie.’\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Stewart talked of the great want of appreciation of Byron--of his\r\nwonderful satire, evinced by the lines in the ‘Age of Bronze’ on Marie\r\nLouise and Wellington: of his philosophy, for which she cited the lines\r\non Don Quixote: of his marvellous condensation and combination, for\r\nwhich she repeated those on the burning of Moscow.\r\n\r\n“She also talked of Trollope’s novels, and said how Trollope had told\r\nher of the circumstances which led to the death of Mrs. Proudie. He had\r\ngone up to write at the round table in the library at the Athenaeum, and\r\nspread his things all over it. It was early in the morning, and there is\r\nseldom any one there at that time. On this occasion, however, two\r\ncountry clergymen were sitting on either side of the fire reading one of\r\nhis own books: after a time they began to talk about them. ‘It is a\r\ngreat pity Trollope does not get some fresh characters,’ said one.\r\n‘Yes,’ said the other, ‘one gets so tired of meeting the same people\r\nagain and again, especially of Mrs. Proudie.’ Then Trollope got up, and\r\nplanting himself on the rug between them with his back to the fire,\r\nsaid, ‘Gentlemen, I do not think it would be honest to listen to you\r\ntalking about my books any more, without telling you that I am the\r\nvictim; but I will add that I quite agree with what you have been\r\nsaying, and that I will give you my word of honour that Mrs. Proudie\r\nshall die in the very next book I write.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 12._--Dr. Asa Grey, who is here, a Professor of Harvard\r\nUniversity, is one of the most famous botanists living; but he is also a\r\nvery charming person. Lowell describes how his\r\n\r\n            ‘indefatigable hours\r\n    Have been as gaily innocent\r\n    And fragrant as his flowers.’[352]\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Stewart talked of Madame Jerome Bonaparte, _née_ Paterson--her\r\nbeauty, her cleverness, her father to whom she always wrote of her\r\n_succès de société_, looking down upon him; but he could always avenge\r\nhimself; he could always write to her, ‘My dear Betsy.’ ‘She would tell\r\nhim how she had been received at this court and at that, and then would\r\ncome his answer with “My dear Betsy.” Oh, it was a terrible revenge.’\r\n\r\n“She talked of the society of her youth, when it was real society, for\r\npeople were never in a hurry. ‘One of the marked figures then was Lady\r\nCork,[353] who, after eighty, always dressed in white, with a little\r\nwhite pulled bonnet and a gold-headed stick. Another, whom you are none\r\nof you old enough to remember, was Lady Morgan, a little old lady, who\r\nused to rouge up to the eyes. M. Fonblanque--he was the editor of the\r\n_Examiner_--used to say, “She is just a spark of hell-fire, and is soon\r\ngoing back to her native element.”\r\n\r\n“‘I wonder,’ said Mrs. Stewart, ‘what has become of an early picture\r\nwhich I remember of Leighton’s. A lady went to all the great artists in\r\nLondon to get them to paint a dream of hers, and they refused, and\r\nLeighton, who was quite a young man, undertook it. She dreamt that she\r\nhad died, and that she had gone up--up to Christ, and that He had turned\r\nher back, and she said, “Why, Lord?” and He replied, “Because your work\r\non earth is not yet done.”\r\n\r\n“‘Leighton painted the Saviour in a glory of yellow light, and the woman\r\nbeing turned back by Him.’\r\n\r\n“This reminiscence led to one of a different kind from Mr. Ashley\r\nPonsonby.\r\n\r\n“‘Creswick the actor was once at a dinner where Irving absorbed all the\r\nconversation and allowed no one else to speak. At last he could stand it\r\nno longer, and turning round to his next neighbour, said, “I had such an\r\nextraordinary dream last night.” Of course, the whole party were\r\nattention at once.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ he said, ‘I dreamt that I was dead, and that I went up to the\r\ngates of heaven and knocked at them. ‘Who are you?’ said St. Peter. ‘I\r\nam Mr. Creswick.’--‘What, Creswick the Academician?’--‘No, Creswick the\r\nactor.’--‘Oh, then I can’t let you in here; we don’t admit any actors\r\nhere,’ said St. Peter, and he turned me away. Dreadfully crestfallen, I\r\nwent and sat down under a juniper-tree, and watched other people\r\narriving at the gates. Many of my friends came and were let in. Then I\r\ntook heart and went and knocked again, and when St. Peter said again\r\nthat I must go away, for he could not admit any actors, I said, ‘But\r\nreally that is not the case, for you have let in Mr. Irving.’--‘That is\r\ntrue,’ said St. Peter, ‘but--he _was no actor_.’”\r\n\r\n“‘Take care,’ said Mrs. Stewart, ‘or you will become that most dreadful\r\nof all things, a self-observant valetudinarian. I was once in the house\r\nwith a lady, who, after talking of nothing else for an hour, said, “I\r\nwon’t speak of my own health, for, when I was young, a dear old wise and\r\njudicious woman said to me, ‘When anybody asks you how you are, always\r\nsay you are very well, for nobody cares.’”\r\n\r\n“‘Many people fall into sin,’ said Mrs. Stewart, ‘merely because they\r\nare tired of the monotony of innocence.’\r\n\r\n“‘He was very fallible,’ she said, ‘and yet capable of becoming that\r\ngreatest of all things--a good man.’\r\n\r\n“‘I think it was a bishop who said, “Most people now go to seek their\r\nancestors at the Jardin des Plantes; for my part, I am content with the\r\nGarden of Eden.”’\r\n\r\n“‘Mr. Pigott is a finished critic, but with the innocence of a child\r\npicking daisies.’\r\n\r\n“‘It was one of the cases in which the highest and the lowest motives\r\ncombine, and oh! in life there are so many of those cases.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_January 12._--Mrs. Stewart has been talking of the cases in which a\r\nlie is justifiable. Of herself she said, ‘There was once a case in which\r\nI thought I ought to tell a lie, but I was not sure. I went to Dr. and\r\nMrs. Bickersteth, and I asked them. They would only answer, “We cannot\r\nadvise you to tell a lie;” they would not advise it, but they did not\r\nforbid it. So when a husband came to question me about his wife, I\r\nequivocated. I said, “She was certainly not seduced by that man.” He\r\nsaid to me very sternly and fiercely, “That is no answer; is my wife\r\ninnocent? I will believe you if you say she is.” And I said, “She is.”\r\nI said it hesitatingly, for I knew it was false, and _he_ knew it was\r\nfalse; he knew that I had lied to him, and he did not believe me in his\r\nheart; but he was glad to believe me outwardly, and he was grateful to\r\nme, and that husband and wife lived together till death. I believe that\r\nwas one of the cases in which it is right to tell a lie. You will say\r\nthat it might lead me to tell many others, but I don’t think it has.\r\nStopford Brooke once said that strict merciless truth was the most\r\nselfish thing he knew.”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Stewart also told us--\r\n\r\n“Dudley Smith, as a very young man, went out to China, and was employed\r\nin the opium trade. He then married and had several children. When he\r\nwas thirty-three his conscience began to work, and he felt the abuses of\r\nopium. He left the trade and became a wharfinger, in which profession he\r\nmade some money, though it was not nearly so lucrative as the occupation\r\nhe had given up, in which he had made £12,000.\r\n\r\n“When he was thirty-five, though he had then a wife and several\r\nchildren, Dudley Smith brought the £12,000 to his man of business,\r\nsaying that it burnt a hole in his pocket, and desiring him to so invest\r\nit as to realise £500 a year for a mission to the Chinese, from whom it\r\nwas taken. This story is delightful to me. It reminds me of a saying of\r\nold Mr. Planchet’s, which meant, though I cannot remember the exact\r\nwords--\r\n\r\n    ‘Of heroes and heroines I am sick grown;\r\n     The only real ones are those that are unknown.’\r\n\r\nWe have been to luncheon at Berkeley Castle to-day. Lady Fitzhardinge,\r\nfat to a degree, is charming, and has the most wonderful knowledge of\r\nall the delicate _finesses_ of form and colour, and the application of\r\nthem to furniture. Her rooms are quite beautiful, everything composing\r\nthe most harmonious picture, down to a string of blue beads suspended\r\nfrom a yellow vase. Lord Fitzhardinge came in to luncheon with Lord\r\nWorcester, Lord Guildford, and another man--four statues! Not one of\r\nthem spoke a word, I believe because not one of them had a word to say,\r\nexcept about racehorses, about which we none of us could say anything.\r\nThe castle relics are most interesting--Sir Francis Drake’s furniture,\r\nQueen Elizabeth’s plate, bequeathed to her cousin Lord Hunsdon, and the\r\nlast prayer of Edward VI., written out by his sister herself, in the\r\ntiniest of little jewel-embossed volumes.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 15._--Mrs. Stewart has been talking much of her great delight in\r\nthe works of Ampère, and of the intense devotion, the passionate love of\r\nthe younger Ampère for Madame Recamier. She was guilty of a _trahison_\r\nto him, though. When he was at Weimar, he wrote to her a private letter,\r\ntelling her particulars about all the people there, which he had better\r\nnot have told, but he wrote them in strict confidence. She made that\r\nletter public. ‘My dear Mr. Hare,’ said Mrs. Stewart, ‘I have never read\r\nany letter more exquisitely, more tenderly pathetic than that which\r\nAmpère wrote her when he heard this--a letter struggling between his old\r\nrespect and admiration and the feeling that his idol had fallen, that he\r\ncould not but reproach her.\r\n\r\n“When Lowell (the American poet and minister) was describing his wife’s\r\nterrible illness, he said, ‘My dear Mrs. Stewart, I would have given Job\r\nten and won.’\r\n\r\n“After Lady Fitzhardinge came, Mrs. Stewart talked much of her\r\nacquaintance with Brother Ignatius. She was at the place of her\r\nson-in-law, Mr. Rogerson, in Scotland. One day out walking, Mrs.\r\nRogerson met a young man, of wonderful beauty, dressed as a monk, with\r\nbare feet and sandals. He asked her whether they were near any inn, and\r\nsaid, ‘The fact is, I have with me two sisters, Sister Gertrude and\r\nanother, and a brother--Brother Augustine. And the brother is very ill,\r\npossibly ill to death, and we cannot go any farther.’ So Mrs. Rogerson\r\nmade them come to her house, and showed them infinite kindness, ‘giving\r\nthem at once water for their feet and all Scripture hospitality.’\r\nBrother Augustine was very ill, very ill indeed, and they all remained\r\nat Mrs. Rogerson’s house three weeks, during which Mrs. Stewart became\r\nvery intimate with them, especially with Brother Ignatius and Sister\r\nGertrude. They used to go out for the day together, ‘and then, in some\r\ndesolate strath, Brother Ignatius would sing, sing hymns like an\r\narchangel, and then he would kneel on the grass and pray.’\r\n\r\n“Many years afterwards, Mrs. Stewart heard that Brother Ignatius was\r\ngoing to preach in London--‘some very bad part of London,’ and she went.\r\nThe room was packed and crowded, but she was in the first row. He\r\npreached, a beautiful young monk, leaning against a pillar. ‘There were\r\nat least a hundred of his attitudes worth painting,’ but there was\r\nnothing in his words. At last a little girl thought he looked faint, and\r\nbrought him a smelling-bottle, which she presented to him kneeling. ‘He\r\nsmelled at it, and then seeing me, an old woman, near him, he sent it on\r\nto me, and I smelled at it too. Afterwards I stayed to see him, and we\r\ntalked together in a small room, talked till midnight. Then he gave me\r\nhis blessing, gave it me very solemnly, and afterwards I said, ‘And God\r\nbless you too, my dear young man.’\r\n\r\n“In the evening Mrs. Stewart spoke much of the Sobieski Stuarts--their\r\ngallant appearance when young, and their change into ‘the mildew of\r\nage.’\r\n\r\n“Apropos of the last words of St. Evremond, ‘Je vais savoir le grand\r\npeut-être,’ Mrs. Stewart mentioned Mrs. Grote having said to her at\r\ntheir last meeting, ‘I trust, dear, that you are living, as I am, in\r\n_respectful hope_.’\r\n\r\n“This led to much talk of Mrs. Grote, who had died (Dec. 29, 1878) when\r\nI was away at Rome with the Prince Royal, and Mrs. Stewart described\r\nhow, when she returned from Hanover after the fall of the royal family,\r\nand was quite full of events there, she went down at once to visit the\r\nGrotes in the country. ‘My dear,’ said Mrs. Grote, ‘I cannot enter into\r\nyour feelings about all your princesses and duchesses, but as regards\r\nyour king, I can enter into them fully: he has lived “as it is\r\nwritten.”’ Mrs. Stewart wrote this to the King, who knows Shakspeare to\r\nhis finger-ends, and he said it did him more good than anything else\r\nanybody wrote or said to him. As long as he lived, he and Mrs. Grote\r\nexchanged stories and messages afterwards, through Mrs. Stewart.\r\n\r\n“Lady William Russell said with much truth of Mr. and Mrs. Grote, ‘He is\r\nladylike, and she is such a perfect gentleman.’\r\n\r\n“When Lady Catherine Clive was painting her town-hall at Hereford, she\r\nwas very anxious to find new, not conventional, attributes for some of\r\nher allegorical figures; she especially wished for something instead of\r\nthe scales of ‘Justice.’ Mrs. Stewart wrote this to Mrs. Grote: ‘Tell\r\nyour friend,’ she answered, ‘not to try to struggle against\r\nconventionalities. Tell her to be content with the scales: she will come\r\nto find the cross conventional next.’\r\n\r\n“When Lady Eastlake undertook to write Mrs. Grote’s life after her\r\ndeath, she asked Mrs. Stewart for all her ‘jottings’ of Mrs. Grote’s\r\nconversations, but she made no use of them. She was so anxious that\r\nevery one should find the book too short, that she really omitted almost\r\neverything characteristic. She wrote her regrets afterwards to Mrs.\r\nStewart, who answered, ‘You are suffering, my dear, from a granted\r\nprayer,’--for, in fact, the book was so short and dry that it passed\r\nalmost unnoticed.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Stewart spoke again of how far a lie might be made right by\r\ncircumstances--giving a wrong direction to a man who was in pursuit of\r\nanother to kill him, &c., and, when some one objected, dwelt upon its\r\nbeing far greater to be noble for others than holy for one’s self. Some\r\none said that in this case all should follow the inner voice, which\r\nwould tell them truly what their real duty was. She replied, ‘Yes,\r\nhaving formed your character by the Master without, you may then act in\r\na crisis by the voice within, which will never be false to your life’s\r\nteachings.... But perhaps,’ she added, ‘I should say, like Dr. Johnson,\r\n“I have been speaking in crass ignorance, according to the failings of\r\nmy fallible human nature”’ (and she repeated some lovely lines on Mary\r\nMagdalen, from Moore’s ‘Rhymes of the Road’);[354] ‘and yet, may we all,\r\nwhilst acting like fallible human beings as we are, trust respectfully\r\nin God’s mercy,--though speaking of no glorious future as reserved for\r\nus, lest He should say, “What hast thou done to deserve that?”’\r\n\r\n“The letters written to the _Morning Post_ from Hanover during the last\r\ndays of the monarchy, and signed H. S., were by Mrs. Stewart: those in\r\nthe _Times_, bearing the same signature, were by another lady.\r\n\r\n“After being for a time with Mrs. Stewart and hearing her talk, I feel\r\nhow great the decay of conversation is since my childhood, when there\r\nwere many people who knew how to _converse_, not merely to _utter_.\r\nScarcely any one now ever says what they really think, and there is an\r\nunwholesome striving after aestheticism, Louis Quatorze, blue china,\r\n&c., which another age, if it remembers it, will think most\r\nridiculous.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_London, Jan. 24._--To Miss Bromley, who had been on Saturday to take\r\nleave of Carlyle, to whom she has been the most faithful of friends for\r\nmany years. He has been sinking for some time, full of power, pathos,\r\nand patience. He woke out of what was supposed to be a death stupor to\r\nrecognise her, and pressed her hand to his lips.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 26._--Went by appointment to see the Queen of Sweden, who is at\r\nClaridge’s Hotel for two nights. She was most kind and gracious, and\r\nsaid that she was glad to thank me in person for all that I had been to\r\nthe Crown Prince. She talked of her illness and its anxieties; but there\r\nwere many other people waiting for an audience, and there was no time\r\nfor any real conversation.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 1._--Met Lady Lyveden at dinner at General Higginson’s. She\r\ndescribed Mrs. Grote saying one day, ‘I have to go out this morning, my\r\ndear; it’s not my usual time, and in fact it’s very inconvenient to me,\r\nbut then you know, my dear, it’s _an affliction job_.’\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Grote, to the last, was very proud of her appearance. Her hands\r\nand feet she was especially proud of. One day Lady Lyveden asked her to\r\ncome in the evening to meet some pleasant people in her neighbouring\r\nhouse in Savile Row. She would not do it. ‘I shall not come, my dear,’\r\nshe said, ‘because I never go out; but besides that, I _could_ not come,\r\nfor, if I did, I should have to put my well-formed figure into one of\r\nyour abominably low arm-chairs.’[355]\r\n\r\n“There was a charm about her primitive household. There was not one of\r\nher servants who spoke of her otherwise than ‘the Missis.’\r\n\r\n“After dinner, she would leave ‘the historian,’ as she called him, in\r\nhis study, and come up to the drawing-room, where she would talk to her\r\nguests and be most entertaining. At nine o’clock, tea would be brought\r\nup--such a tea as one never sees now, with tablecloth, muffins, cakes,\r\n&c. Then she would say to the servant, ‘Bring up the historian’--and the\r\nhistorian was ‘brought up.’ He was vastly civil, of the old school, and\r\nwore a great deal of frill. He would take his place opposite the table,\r\nand immediately taking a large clean pocket-handkerchief from his\r\npocket, spread it very deliberately over his knees, after which a dog\r\njumped up and sat upon it. Then he would say, as to a perfect stranger,\r\n‘And now, Mrs. Grote, will you kindly favour us with a sonata?’ and Mrs.\r\nGrote, who was an admirable musician, would play a very long sonata\r\nindeed; after which he would say, ‘Thank you, Mrs. Grote. I am sure Lady\r\nLyveden joins with me in being very much obliged to you for your\r\nbeautiful sonata.’[356]\r\n\r\n“Lady Eastlake’s written portrait misses all the wit, all the acted\r\ncomedy of Mrs. Grote’s real life. She made, however, a capital pencil\r\nsketch (which Lady Lyveden has) of Mrs. Grote, who was greatly pleased\r\nwith it.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 9._--Met Princess Mary at luncheon at Lady Harrington’s, who\r\nonly presented me by ‘Here is Augustus.’ The Princess was good enough to\r\ntalk to me for a long time afterwards.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 22._--Dined at Lady Airlie’s, sitting by Lady Herbert of Lea,\r\nwho talked much of her long residence in Sicily, with which she was\r\nconnected through her mother. She went about a great deal amongst the\r\npoor at Palermo, generally accompanied by a Sister of Charity, and on\r\none occasion nursed a sick brigand. Soon afterwards, her children, going\r\nto the Bay of Mondello to pick up shells, were seized by brigands, but\r\nas soon as they found whose children they were, they sent them back to\r\nher safe. Another day, Lady Herbert was returning from a village,\r\nwhither she had been on some office of charity, to Palermo, as it was\r\nalmost dark. There were high walls on either side of the way. Suddenly\r\nthe Sister of Charity who was with her began to go so fast that she\r\ncould not keep up with her. ‘Non posso, Sorella mia, non posso cammináre\r\npiù,’ she said. ‘But look behind you,’ said the Sister. She looked, and\r\nsaw three brigands following them. It would have been impossible to get\r\naway, so she waited till they came up and said, ‘Che vuole?’ They begged\r\nher to excuse them: they were sent by their chief to protect her as far\r\nas the walls of Palermo: _they_ knew her, but others might not, and\r\nthey were ordered to ascertain that she came to no harm.\r\n\r\n“A Hungarian Count and Countess were at dinner. He talked of fashion\r\nvery amusingly. He said he had learnt much from his herdsman, a very\r\nclever man (‘he was hung afterwards, poor man, but he was very clever’),\r\nwho chose the animal to bear the bell, which was accustomed to go in the\r\ncentre of the herd. He asked why this was, and the herdsman answered,\r\n‘Because the one who goes first naturally runs first into all dangers,\r\nand when he has done it once or twice, the herd begin to find it out,\r\nand they cease to follow him; and the one who goes last is constantly\r\nleft behind, and the herd begin to find it out, and they cease to follow\r\n_him_; but the one that is in the middle, and chooses the safest place,\r\nthat is the one they know to be wise, and so, in any time of danger,\r\nthey will assuredly follow him. The Count spoke of the mania for\r\nhusband-murder which prevailed at Marseilles till it became quite a\r\nfashion. Six women were tried at the same assizes for murdering their\r\nhusbands. In some of these cases there seemed something of reason or\r\nexcuse, but at last there came a lady whose husband had been all that\r\nwas most charming and delightful, and where the crime seemed\r\nincomprehensible. The judge pressed her as to her motive, and at first\r\nshe said, ‘Ces dames me l’ont mis dans l’esprit,’ and, when urged\r\nfurther, ‘Mais, cela se fait à Marseilles!’\r\n\r\n“The London world has been full of the ‘Reminiscences of Carlyle,’\r\npublished with furious haste by Froude a fortnight after his death. They\r\nhave dwarfed their subject from a giant into a pigmy. His journal and\r\nletters speak well of no one except his own family, and assail with the\r\nutmost vituperation all who differed from him. For his wife there is a\r\nlong wail of affection, which would be touching if the devotion had not\r\nbegun after her death. ‘Never marry a genius,’ she said to Lady\r\nAshburton; ‘I have done it, and suffered from it; but then, after my\r\ndeath I shall have an apotheosis’--and she has had it. Much of Carlyle’s\r\nvirulence arose from the state of his health: he used to say, ‘I can\r\nwish the devil nothing worse than that he may have to digest with my\r\nstomach to all eternity; there will be no need of fire and brimstone\r\nthen.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 28._--Dined at Lady Lyveden’s. Sat by Lady S., who was very\r\npleasant. She talked of Tennyson, who had been to stay with her. He\r\ndesired his sons to let her know that he should like to be asked to read\r\nsome of his poems in the evening. Nevertheless, when she asked him, he\r\nmade a piece of work about it, and said to the other guests, ‘I do it,\r\nbut I only do it because Lady S. absolutely insists upon it.’ He read\r\nbadly and with too much emotion: over ‘Maud’ he sobbed passionately.\r\n\r\n“Afterwards, at Lady Ridley’s party, Lord Houghton talked to me about\r\nCarlyle--of how his grimness, which was unrelieved in the\r\n‘Reminiscences,’ was relieved in the _man_ by much kindly humour. He\r\nsaid that he and Lady Houghton were almost the only people spoken well\r\nof in the book. Mr. Spedding used to say that Carlyle always needed that\r\nkind of indulgence which most of us need in a fit of violent\r\ntoothache.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_April 3._--Dined with old Lady Combermere, who declared that only two\r\npeople ever had any excuse for living in the country, and they were Adam\r\nand Eve!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_April 8._--An amusing luncheon at Lady Sebright’s, with an immense\r\nparty of actors, actresses, painters, literati, and ‘great ladies.’ It\r\nseemed a reversion of the old order of things when the actresses had\r\nsaid they ‘must inquire a little into the characters of the great\r\nladies’ they were asked to meet!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, April 9._--Lea says, ‘It’s seven weeks from Guttit to\r\nAaster, and seven weeks from Aaster to Whissuntide.... You needna’ to\r\ntak’ any trouble about the clocks, for when Lady Day comes it ‘ull mak’\r\n’em all right, for there’s just twelve hours of sunshine on Lady Day.’\r\n\r\n“‘After New Year’s day every day is just a cock’s ted longer than the\r\nlast: a cock’s ted, you know, is just the time a cock stops between its\r\ncrowings.’\r\n\r\n“‘When we were any ways contrairy, my father used to say, “Yes, it’s\r\nalways too wet or too fine: it’s always too hot or too cold: that’s the\r\nway of the world.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_London, May 12._--To Mrs. Duncan Stewart, whom I found, after her\r\nsevere illness, sitting in a picturesque wrapper reading old _Figaros_.\r\n‘So much in them, you know, so much more than in any other newspaper.’\r\nThey called up reminiscences of Lady Blessington, whom she thinks Lady\r\nAirlie like, though without her perfect beauty: then of the trial of ...\r\nfor forgery, she being a grand-daughter of Stephanie Lafitte, ‘whom I\r\nremember, not in her wedding-dress, but in one of her trousseau dresses,\r\nfor it was velvet. All French girls--and I was a French girl then--are\r\nbrought up to observe and think a great deal about dress, and it is\r\nterrible, quite horrible to them, that an unmarried girl should have a\r\nvelvet dress: thus the remembrance clings to me.’\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Stewart had been most alarmingly ill, but said she had rallied\r\nfrom the moment Alfred Denison paid her a visit. She had said to him\r\nthat she had a presentiment she should not recover, and he had answered\r\nher that he had never been ill without such a presentiment, and that it\r\nhad never come true.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday I went to the Hollands to meet Princess Louise, and to tell\r\nher some stories which she had graciously wished to hear. I knew that I\r\nwas to do this, but it was sufficiently formidable notwithstanding. The\r\nPrincess felt that it must be so, and was very sympathetic, and as nice\r\nas she could be, talking first of my books, and saying that my Italian\r\nvolumes were never out of her hands when she was in Italy, &c. I had\r\nbeen allowed to choose the rest of the audience, and the Childers,\r\nNorthcotes, Goschens, Lady Taunton, and Mrs. Dundas were there.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 18._--Luncheon with Catherine Vaughan at the Temple. She was very\r\nfull of a story of Sir F. Gore Ouseley. He took a house near London, and\r\na young man went to stay with him, an atheist and a reprobate. The next\r\nmorning this man came down an altered person, saying that he had heard a\r\nsupernatural voice in the night, which had so horrified him that it\r\nwould change his whole life--the voice had blasphemed in the most awful\r\nlanguage. That day was November 22. The young man went away, and he\r\nreally did change his life.\r\n\r\n“The following year, on November 22, Sir F. Gore Ouseley suddenly opened\r\nhis door at night, and saw at the end of the passage a brilliant light,\r\nand in the light the figure of an old man in a dressing-gown--luminous,\r\nand all the rays of light issuing from his figure. Suddenly the light\r\nwent out: there was nothing more to be seen.\r\n\r\n“Some time after, Sir F. Gore Ouseley went to visit the owner of the\r\nhouse he had rented, who lived at a distance. Whilst waiting for him, he\r\nwas attracted by the picture of an old gentleman over the chimney-piece,\r\nand recognised the very man he had seen. When the master of the house\r\ncame in, he said, ‘Pray excuse me, but whom does that portrait\r\nrepresent?’--‘Oh,’ answered the owner, ‘that is no one you are likely to\r\nhave heard of: it is a grandfather of mine, who was a very bad man\r\nindeed: so bad, that, in fact, we never mention him.’ Afterwards, Sir\r\nFrederick found that he had strangled his wife in the very passage where\r\nhe appeared, and had then committed suicide.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Austen, Rector of Whitby, was present when Catherine told this. He\r\nsaid that Professor Owen had gone to stay at a house in Essex, where the\r\nhostess apologised for putting him into the haunted room. The next\r\nmorning he was asked if he had heard anything. ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘I have\r\nheard something, but I should like to say nothing about it till I have\r\nslept in that room again.’ The second morning he said that each night he\r\nhad heard loud cries of a child proceeding from the hearthstone, and\r\nbegged that a mason might be sent for and the stone removed. This was\r\ndone, and the skull of a child was found beneath the stone. They buried\r\nit in the garden, and the cries have never been heard since.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holyrood Palace, May 27._--On the evening of the 14th, at Cleveland\r\nHouse, first Lady Aberdeen, and then Aberdeen, asked me to come hither\r\nwith them as equerry, during their residence for the Lord High\r\nCommissionership. I stayed in London for Miss Beaumont’s wedding with\r\nCoplestone Bampfylde, and joined them on Friday, arriving at 9 P.M.,\r\nwhen ninety guests were at dinner in the brilliantly lighted picture\r\ngallery, in which all the kings of Scotland were, painted to order by\r\nthe same hand and from the same model. After dining by myself in a small\r\nroom, I joined the party in the reception-rooms, where I entered at once\r\nupon my duties, which, for the most part, seem to be to talk right and\r\nleft to every one I see. Each evening the Synods of the different\r\ndistricts dine, some eighty or a hundred clergymen, and I have generally\r\nfound from my clerical neighbours that they regard it as their carnival,\r\nlooked forward to throughout the whole year, and giving them much to\r\ntalk of when they return home. Sometimes military, legal, or other\r\nclasses are mixed with them. In the afternoons we have generally gone\r\nin state to visit institutions of one kind or other, the most\r\ninteresting being the really beautiful Infirmary, built entirely by the\r\npeople of Scotland, and the marvellous printing establishment of Messrs.\r\nNelson. When we were at the latter, most hands were busy over the\r\nrevised New Testament, in which there are 7000 alterations from the\r\nolder edition, 2000 of them being important.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holyrood Palace, May 28._--It is an interesting life here, but a very\r\nfatiguing one--the hours and hours of standing, as for real royalty; the\r\netiquette of always addressing Aberdeen as ‘Your Grace,’ and getting up\r\nwhen he comes into a room; the whirlpool of invitations to be sent, in\r\nwhich one is always being swallowed up.\r\n\r\n“I have had little enough of individual conversation, except with Ally\r\nGordon, the very pleasant aide-de-camp, and with Dr. Russell the\r\nchaplain, who has talked much of Carlyle. He said to a friend who\r\nvisited him a short time before his death, ‘We are both old men now, and\r\nI daresay you find, as I do, that it is well to rest upon the simple\r\nanswer to the first question in our Shorter Catechism--‘What is your\r\nobject in life?’--‘To glorify my Maker and to enjoy Him for ever.’\r\n\r\n“On Sunday we were at St. Giles’s in the morning, and in the afternoon\r\nhad a long service and sermon in the picture-gallery. These Scotch\r\nservices are most wearisome, and the long prayers, _informing_ the\r\nAlmighty upon subjects on which He is all-wise and we are utterly\r\nignorant, are most revolting.\r\n\r\n“One especially feels the length of these prayers in standing, in great\r\nheat, in the General Assembly, where we occupy places near the throne,\r\nwhich is raised in a gallery: the Moderator and ex-Moderator sit at a\r\ntable beneath, and the five hundred members occupy the body of the\r\nhouse. The Moderator, Dr. Smith, is a most beautiful and benign old man,\r\nfull of simple and true Christianity, who looks, with his courtly\r\nmanners, as if he never could wear anything _but_ his court dress.\r\nTo-day we and about a hundred other guests breakfasted with him at his\r\nhotel.\r\n\r\n“The Holyrood which struck such ‘dismay and terror’ into the hearts of\r\nthe French emigrant princes is to me most captivating. I am often\r\nreminded of Hogg’s admirably descriptive lines:--\r\n\r\n    ‘When Mary turned her wond’ring eyes\r\n     On rocks that seemed to prop the skies;\r\n     On palace, park, and battled pile;\r\n     On lake and river, sea and isle;\r\n     O’er woods and meadows bathed in dew,\r\n     To distant mountains wild and blue;\r\n     She thought the isle that gave her birth\r\n     The sweetest, wildest land on earth.’\r\n\r\n“On Sunday afternoon I went up Arthur’s Seat with Ally Gordon and the\r\nladies-in-waiting--Lady Margaret Hely Hutchinson and Lady Mary\r\nAshburnham. Most exquisite was the view over the sunlit slopes of\r\nEdinburgh in its purple haze. Besides this, I shall have many\r\nrecollections of the delightful gardens of Holyrood in this still hot\r\nweather, the apple-trees bursting into bloom, the hoary chapel with its\r\ngothic arches and windows, the Salisbury Crags, deeply purple above,\r\nand fading into mist below.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 29._--All has gone well and smoothly, and there is great interest\r\nin the Holyrood life--the moving diorama of people, with the varying\r\nlights and shades of character which they display, the old-world aspect\r\nof all that has to be done, with the pages in their crimson and white\r\nliveries, the chaplain and purse-bearer in their court dresses, and the\r\nmounted guard. It has all been made especially pleasant by being on such\r\nthoroughly friendly terms with the ladies-in-waiting and with one of the\r\naides-de-camp, Ally Gordon: the extreme goodness of the other, who has\r\nbeen vehemently ‘converted,’ being a sort of barrier to intimacy.\r\n\r\n“Old Miss Louisa Hope has been amongst the people who have come to\r\nHolyrood. She talked much of her friendship with Lord Brougham, with\r\nwhom she corresponded constantly for many years. She had many religious\r\nconversations with him, and he often used to dwell with her, as in his\r\npublic lectures, on the sublimity of that description of God, ‘eternal,\r\nimmortal, invisible,’ which has been spoilt in the revised translation\r\nby changing the word ‘immortal’ into ‘incorruptible.’ After he had been\r\nbetrayed into especially bad language in her presence, she wrote a\r\nstrong remonstrance to him. He said nothing definite in answer, but\r\nthenceforth always addressed her as ‘Dearest Miss Hope.’ When she heard\r\nthat he was not likely to live, Miss Hope wrote to him, saying that she\r\ntrusted that, if he was able to write himself, he would give her some\r\nsign of his assurance as to a future life; but that, if he were not\r\nable to write himself, he would not notice her request. Lord Brougham\r\nwrote, ‘I trust entirely in the _graciousness_ of Him who died for me,’\r\nand she was satisfied.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday we drove out to Winton to Lady Ruthven. It was a lovely day,\r\nthe sea deep blue, and the trees, especially the sycamores, in their\r\nrichest foliage. We found the house just set in order after its\r\ndevastation during the fire which consumed the dining-room three weeks\r\nago, when everything was thrown out of the windows. Dear old Lady\r\nRuthven herself sat all the time on a chair on the lawn watching the\r\nflames. She asked if every one was out of the castle, and being assured\r\nthat it was so, said, ‘Is Peppy (her dog) safe?’--‘Yes, my lady.’--‘Is\r\nmy blue vase safe?’--‘Yes, my lady.’--‘Then I am quite satisfied.’ And\r\nshe bade every person on the property go to church the next day to\r\nreturn thanks for her preservation. She received me with the greatest\r\naffection, and bade me kiss her.[357]\r\n\r\n“At the great dinner at Holyrood in the evening I took in a Mrs. Murray,\r\nwho talked pleasantly about the old phase of Edinburgh society which she\r\nremembered. ‘There were three subjects--wine, law, and contradiction:\r\nwine is extinct now as a topic, but the other two, and especially the\r\nlast, are as much to the fore as ever.’ She said that she had studied\r\nlaw herself, because it was the subject on which her husband was most\r\ninterested, and she liked him to be able to discuss all his occupations\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\n“Another day I took in Mrs. Fleeming Jenkin, the marvellous amateur\r\nactress. She described her home life and the reading aloud to her boys.\r\nShe read Landor, Alison, Scott. Only Byron’s ‘Childe Harold’ was a\r\nfailure. They got through the first two cantos, then the youngest boy\r\nsaid, ‘Did the Childe never cheer up?’ and she was obliged to allow that\r\nhe did not: so the book was closed.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday I talked much with Mrs. Fraser--Professor Fraser’s wife. She\r\ndescribed her visit to Hurstmonceaux--a week spent at the Rectory after\r\nher wedding tour, and going down twice to Lime, and my dear Mother\r\nsitting by the open window looking on the sunny lawn and flowers and the\r\nsparkling water.\r\n\r\n“To-day, at St. Giles’s, Professor Flint preached a magnificent sermon\r\non ‘I am the True Witness,’ describing how the doctrine which Christ\r\npreached was that of the kingdom; ‘that of the Church He left to\r\nothers.’ His whole teaching was that inculcated by Diderot--‘Elargissez\r\nDieu, montrez-lui à l’enfant, non dans le temple, mais partout et\r\ntoujours.’”[358]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 30._--Our stay is nearly at an end, and I am very sorry.... It is\r\nimpossible to live with the two charming old sisters (Lady Aberdeen and\r\nLady Ashburnham), so one in every thought and act, without being\r\nimpressed by their extreme simplicity and goodness; and Scottish ideas\r\nof clanship are more captivated by the fact of ‘His Grace’ being\r\nfollowed everywhere by his mother and aunt, and their going hand in\r\nhand with him in every good work, than they could be by the most\r\nbrilliant court. Yesterday the preaching and praying were tremendous.\r\nNow we are just off to a luncheon, then to visit the castle in state,\r\nthen a soldiers’ home, a sculptor’s studio, an artist’s studio, a dinner\r\nof a hundred, and the Assembly again in state at 10 P.M. I cannot say\r\nhow kind every one is to me at Edinburgh.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_London, July 10._--With Lady Paget to hear Spurgeon preach at his\r\ngreat Tabernacle near the Elephant and Castle. The vast congregation,\r\nthe united sound of the thousands of voices in the hymn, the earnestness\r\nand zest of everything, were very striking: but far more so the strange,\r\ncommon, coarse preacher. The text was from Rev. xxii. 17, ‘Let him that\r\nheareth say Come.’ He described a sinner as like Leviathan, in whom\r\nthere must be some weak spot betwixt its thousand scales, between which\r\nthe dart of the exhorters could penetrate before death intervened and\r\nset the ‘wax-tablet’ of his character for ever. He spoke of the\r\ndifferent ways of saying ‘Come,’ and acted them: that a ‘plain English,\r\nnot half Dutch-Latin-Hebrew way of speaking,’ should be employed: that\r\n‘prayer was as necessary as that a servant should tell her master who\r\nhad called: that no servant was equal to answering for herself without\r\nreferring to her master.’\r\n\r\n“The rough similes just suited the congregation, and also the jokes, at\r\nwhich the people laughed aloud, but not irreverently. ‘A friend of mine\r\nwas preaching in the street the other day, and one of those fellows\r\npassed by who has felt the hand touched by a bishop’s lawn sleeve upon\r\nhis blessed pate (not that I think there is any good in that; I do not\r\nknow if you do), and asked him by what authority he was preaching, and\r\nmy friend answered, ‘By the authority of Jesus Christ, who said, “Let\r\nhim that heareth say Come.”’ ‘Popes were represented sometimes with a\r\ndove whispering the words which they should speak into their ears--they\r\nwere represented with a dove; I hope it was not really a raven.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was suddenly called away in the middle of the season by the alarming\r\nillness of my dearest old nurse, and for several weeks was at Holmhurst\r\nwith her, in the mysterious solitude of the shadow of death, in which so\r\nmany of my earlier years were passed, and then I had the intense\r\nthankfulness of seeing life return into the dear old face connected with\r\nso much that no one else remembers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nHOME SORROWS\r\n\r\n     “Faire le bien, connaître le vrai, voilà ce qui distingue un homme\r\n     d’un autre; le reste n’est rien.

I thought little of it at the time,\r\nas he was so often sick, and I had lately seen him looking better and\r\nhappier than he had done since his sister Mary’s death. On Thursday 14th\r\nthere was a great dinner-party at the Deanery. Catherine Vaughan dined,\r\nand as, at the last moment, Arthur was not well enough to appear, she\r\nwent in to sit with him after dinner, and finding him very dispirited\r\nand unwell, gave up her intention of going to Llandaff next day, and\r\nmoved to the Deanery instead. That day erysipelas came on, and she was\r\nprevented seeing him till 3 A.M. on the morning of Monday the 18th, when\r\nthe doctors called her, saying that an alarming change had come on.\r\nCanon Farrar was then summoned, and administered the Sacrament, but when\r\nhe came to the blessing, Arthur motioned him to silence, and gave the\r\nwords of the longer Benediction himself, with the same solemnity with\r\nwhich he spoke them at Augusta’s funeral. Then also Arthur spoke some\r\nfarewell words--of grateful affection for the Queen, of trustful\r\nexhortation for his successor in the Deanery, of thankful appreciation\r\nof the fidelity of his housekeeper, Mrs. Waters, and the services of his\r\nbutler and Charlotte the housemaid. Those who surrounded him then\r\nthought that he was sinking, but he rallied, and in the morning all the\r\nsymptoms were favourable.\r\n\r\nAt 10 A.M. on Monday, I broke through the cordon which surrounded the\r\nDeanery, and made my way up to Catherine, who was glad to have me with\r\nher. The large rooms were silent and hushed, though many persons,\r\nchiefly Bruces and Baillies, were moving in and out. It was the dead\r\nheat of July, not a leaf stirring. In the afternoon, Arthur was so much\r\nbetter that I went away, and even kept an engagement to dine out. But\r\nnext morning came the shock of his death--Arthur--the “Cousin Arthur” of\r\nmy childhood. He had become worse at 9.30 P.M. The Archbishop read\r\nprayers in the room; they all knelt around; he never spoke more; and\r\nbefore midnight it was over.\r\n\r\nCatherine and I both took leave of the Deanery for ever the next\r\nmorning, but I went back to Westminster for the sad services of Sunday\r\nand Monday. The funeral sermons were much more affecting than the\r\nfuneral itself; _that_ was far less touching than Augusta’s, for _he_\r\nwas not there to be felt with and for; and yet the number and the\r\nunusual variety of true mourners made it a very remarkable sight.\r\n\r\nTo me it was a reopening of many beloved memories, and then a sealing\r\nthem away for ever. On the day after his death his sister and Hugh\r\nPearson, his dearest friend, wrote to me, asking me to undertake his\r\nbiography, to which I gladly assented, feeling sure that I could do it\r\nwell, and that no one could possibly know his life as well as myself.\r\nBut Sir George Grove, one of his literary executors, did not permit my\r\nundertaking it.\r\n\r\nThe following weeks at Holmhurst were occupied on an article which I\r\nwrote upon Arthur in _Macmillan_[359] (Sept. 1881), or rather in hunting\r\nup material for it amongst the few papers I myself possessed, as the\r\nliterary executors allowed me access to nothing else. Yet, in doing it,\r\nI could feel that, though somewhat estranged from him in late years,\r\nthere was no other who knew _all_ his life, its surroundings, motives,\r\nand interests as I did. I went afterwards to Catherine, but first paid a\r\nshort visit in Suffolk to the ever-kind and pleasant Mrs. Paterson and\r\nher husband at their charming Rectory of Brome.

I only just missed meeting two Mr.\r\nTyrrells, who have been building a church, not uncalled for, they said,\r\nas an expiatory offering, for one of their ancestors murdered William\r\nRufus, and another the Princes in the Tower. We saw Eye, with its fine\r\nchurch and pretty black and white grammar-school. The magnates of this\r\nneighbourhood are Sir Edward and Lady Caroline Kerrison, who possess two\r\nplaces, of which Brome Hall has delightful old gardens, while Oakley\r\ncontains the trunk of the tree under which St. Edward was said to have\r\nbeen shot by the Danes, and in which, when it was cut down, an\r\narrow-head was found imbedded. Sir E. Kerrison has just demolished a\r\nfine old wooden bridge, the successor of that under which the king\r\nconcealed himself, and where he was discovered to a newly married couple\r\nby the light gleaming on his spurs. They betrayed him to the Danes, who\r\nshot him. Dying, he cursed all persons who should cross that fatal\r\nbridge over the Waveney on their way to or from a marriage, and on such\r\noccasions the country people will always go two miles round to avoid it.\r\nClose by is a spot where the discovery of flint weapons in a\r\npre-historic stratum has compelled an entire re-arrangement of geology,\r\nas proving the existence of the world some millions of years before it\r\nwas supposed to have been created.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday I went to Norwich, and how many memories were awakened by the\r\nfirst sight of its beautiful spire! The river, the gateways, the ferry,\r\nthe cathedral were the same: only the beautiful palace was turned into a\r\ncommon fifth-rate house. All who met there have now passed away except\r\nCatherine Vaughan and Lea; but one seemed to see them all--the venerable\r\nwhite head of my uncle the Bishop in his stall; Sedgwick emerging from\r\nhis house; Aunt Kitty in the broad garden-walk; my dearest Mother in the\r\nAbbey Room; Sarah Burgess[360] in her still existing little room down\r\nthe steps; Arthur and Mary, Owen and Charlie--all gone!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORWICH FROM MOUSEHOLD.][361]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sept. 25._--We went from Brome to see Roydon. Mr. G. E. Frere is\r\nsquire there, an eccentric man of old family, who has planted the\r\nchurchyard with flowers appropriate to each of the graves near them. One\r\nis covered with wormwood: it is that of two old sisters in the parish,\r\nhorribly ill-tempered, who both became bedridden, but each was provided\r\nwith a stick that she might whack her companion as she lay in the bed\r\nnear her. We met Mr. H., an ugly man, intensely. proud of his worthless\r\npictures. Warren, the son of ‘Ten Thousand a Year,’ the clergyman who\r\npreached such a capital sermon on the single word ‘but,’ dined with him,\r\nand when Mr. H. pointed out what he calls a Murillo, said, ‘Really a\r\nGorillo--a family portrait, I suppose!’ We also went to see Wingfield,\r\nan interesting old fortified manor of the De la Poles, and their\r\nmagnificent tombs in the church. One of them married Chaucer’s\r\ngrand-daughter and was murdered at Calais in the time of Henry VI.;\r\nanother married the sister of Edward IV.\r\n\r\n“On leaving Brome, I made a tourette into Norfolk--to dilapidated\r\nWalsingham, once the most celebrated shrine in England: to Lynn, with a\r\ncustom-house worthy of Flanders: to Castle Rising, a Norman tower almost\r\nhidden in its green ballium: to Wymondham, with a splendid semi-ruined\r\nchurch, perpendicular outside, but Norman within: and to the glorious\r\nruins of Castle Acre. The Coke of Elizabeth’s time bought so much land\r\nin Norfolk, that the Queen ordered him to be told that he must not buy\r\nany more, he would own too much for a subject. He petitioned, however,\r\nthat he might just buy three acres more, which would complete his\r\nestate. The Queen said, ‘Yes, he might certainly do that;’ and he bought\r\nCastle Acre, West Acre, and South Acre, three huge properties, only the\r\nnucleus of which has descended to Lord Leicester.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“On the 20th I came to Llandaff.... We have been to see the ruins of a\r\ndeserted manor-house which belonged to Sir George Aubrey. It was\r\nabandoned on account of a family tragedy. Sir George’s only son, a\r\nlittle boy, one day refused to eat his pudding. ‘You must,’ said the\r\nfather. The child said he really could not, and implored with strange\r\nanguish to be excused, but the father insisted. Three hours after the\r\nchild died in frightful agonies. That day the cook, by mistake, had put\r\narsenic into the pudding instead of sugar.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday Lord and Lady Romilly[362] fetched me to their pretty little\r\nhouse of Porthkerry, overhanging the Bristol Channel, and to-day we have\r\ndriven through pouring rain to visit Fon Mon (pronounced Fun-Mun), a\r\nvery curious old house of the thirteenth century.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Penrhos, Anglesea, Oct. 9._--From Llandaff I went to Tenby, an\r\nindescribably delightful place, with its varied coast, its wonderful\r\ncaves, its rich festoons of clematis hanging over the cliffs, and its\r\nsapphire and chrysoprase seas. A girdle of old castles and abbeys\r\nsurrounds the place, affording an endless variety of excursions. I saw\r\nsomething at Tenby of many members of the kindly respectable family of\r\nAllen, and the Dean of the same name welcomed me to St. Davids, which is\r\ntruly marvellous in charm and interest--the cathedral, richly,\r\nexquisitely beautiful; the ruined palace and college; and the village,\r\nwith its fine old cross, isolated in the solitude of a hollow in the\r\nvast swooping hills, sixteen miles from a railway, almost from any other\r\ninhabited place. It is said that if you take a sod from the churchyard\r\nand stand upon it on the shore of the neighbouring sea, you look across\r\nthe mist of waters into all the glories of fairyland; and truly this\r\nseems almost the case without the assistance of the churchyard sod, all\r\nis so wondrously, uniquely, weirdly beautiful.\r\n\r\n“On my way to this Stanley home of many memories, I went to visit the\r\nWilliams’s of Parcian, in central Anglesea, where the very savageness of\r\nthe country gives it an interest, and the desolate coves of its\r\nsea-shore, in one of which, with the beautiful name of Moelvra, the\r\n_Royal Charter_ was lost.\r\n\r\n“Mr. (William) Stanley[363] is very kind, and has a great deal of shrewd\r\ncleverness of its own sort; but a great deal has been written about the\r\ncharms and moral advantages of the life of a country gentleman who never\r\nleaves his own place; nothing of its still more evident disadvantages.\r\nSurely no life has so strong a tendency to generate self-importance,\r\nexclusive possession, tenaciousness of authority, jealousy of\r\ninterference, hatred of independence in others.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Kinmel, Oct. 14._--A kind invitation from Lord and Lady Penrhyn took\r\nme from Penrhos to Penrhyn Castle, which is a very stately building\r\noutside, though the huge stone corridors and richly decorated Norman\r\nrooms are very unsuited for home comfort. A regiment of young ladies,\r\nMiss Pennants--daughters, step-daughters, and step-grand-daughters of\r\nLady Penrhyn[364] appeared at every meal. The lady of the castle herself\r\nis one of the most natural and unworldly women in the world; and Lord\r\nPenrhyn[365] was most agreeable with his personal reminiscences. He\r\ndescribed the coronation of George IV., where he stood close to Queen\r\nCaroline as she entered the carriage to drive away, and he said the\r\nexpression of her countenance was the most diabolical thing he ever\r\nlooked upon. Lord Penrhyn rode after Lord Anglesea, the Waterloo hero,\r\nwhen he was followed by a hooting mob through St. James’s Park. Lord\r\nAnglesea backed his horse between the trees, set his teeth, and hissed\r\nback at the yelling people. Then he said, ‘If every man of you were a\r\nhundred men, and each of them had a hundred hands, and a bayonet in each\r\nhand, I should still do my--_duty!_’ Then the people cheered him.\r\n\r\n“Lord and Lady Penrhyn took me to Pennisinant, Ogwen Bank, and the slate\r\nquarries. The two first cannot be much altered since my mother’s\r\ndescriptions of them in her childhood, except by the growth of trees,\r\nand are very lovely, with mossy rocks breaking the cascatelle of the\r\nOgwen, and old sycamores--now glorious in colour--on the grassy knolls,\r\nrelieved against a wild background of purple mountains. At Ogwen Bank,\r\nthe representation of our Lady Penrhyn’s pugs remains over the\r\nchimney-piece.\r\n\r\n“The life at Penrhyn Castle was most easy and agreeable, with the\r\nfreedom which only exists in very great houses, the plenty of time to\r\noneself, and yet interesting society. The same may be said of Kinmel,\r\nwhich is like a great château in France.\r\n\r\n“And here it has been a real pleasure to meet my sweet cousin Lizzie,\r\nLady Loch,[366] and her charming husband, Sir Henry, Governor of the\r\nIsle of Man: she is really one of the best people I ever saw, as well as\r\none of the pleasantest.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_London, Nov. 1._--Dined with Lady Lyndhurst in Eaton Square. She\r\ntalked of her early life. ‘I lived in Paris with my father, and I saw\r\nnobody. I never expected to marry; why should I? I had no fortune and no\r\nattractions. The first time I saw my Lord was when he came to Paris with\r\nhis first wife. He came to see my father, and we went out driving with\r\nhim. He and my father sat forward, and another young lady and I sat\r\nback, and most terribly afraid I was of him, and not a word did I\r\nspeak--a shy, awkward girl sitting bolt upright.\r\n\r\n“‘When my Lord was a widower, he came to Paris again. I was\r\nseven-and-twenty then, and was keeping my father’s house. Lord Lyndhurst\r\ncame to breakfast with my father, and I gave them their coffee and\r\nwhatever they wanted, and then sat there reading my _Galignani_, and not\r\nthinking a bit about them. Suddenly Lord Lyndhurst asked me if I knew of\r\nany very sunny apartment to let. “Oh, yes,” I said; “there is a friend\r\nof mine who wants to let just what you wish for, and, if you will wait a\r\nminute, I will run and get the keys, and can show it you.” So I got the\r\nkeys, and he went with me, and the apartment was a capital one and\r\nsuited him very well; and then, to my surprise, he asked me if I should\r\nbe at home in the afternoon, and I thought, “What on earth can the old\r\nman want to come again for?”--and I answered him that I did not know.\r\nAnd, in fact, I forgot all about it, and went out driving to the Bois;\r\nand when I came in, the servant said Lord Lyndhurst had been. It gave me\r\na sort of shock, and I went to my room, and said to myself, “What on\r\nearth can this mean?” But the next day before I was up--_before I was\r\nup_, if you please--I had a note from Lord Lyndhurst asking when I\r\nshould be at home; and he came at that hour, and he came twice a day for\r\nthree months, and it became quite awkward, every one talked of it--Paris\r\nis so small a world. However, at the end of that time he proposed.\r\nAfterwards I said, “Now do tell me what the dickens made you want to\r\nmarry me--a woman without family, without fortune, and most decidedly\r\nwithout beauty?” and he said he did not know. After he had engaged me to\r\nmarry him, he had to go back to England to his law-courts, and my father\r\ntold me that I had better begin to get my things ready and buy my\r\ntrousseau; but I said, “No, I should most certainly do nothing of the\r\nkind, for I did not believe for an instant that my Lord would ever come\r\nback again.”\r\n\r\n“‘But he did come back, and we were married, and I had twenty-six years\r\nof the most perfect happiness ever allotted to woman. My Lord had the\r\nmost perfect temper in the world, and in all the years we were together,\r\nwe never had even a difference of opinion. He never came in to\r\nbreakfast, and he never took luncheon, so he never appeared in our rooms\r\ntill dinner-time, but I trotted in and out of his library, and the\r\noftener I went in, the better he was pleased.\r\n\r\n“‘I had seen nothing of the world before I was married, but I saw plenty\r\nof it afterwards: indeed, a few years after, he was made Lord\r\nChancellor, and that was the top of everything. The world was the one\r\ndrawback to my happiness, for through almost the whole time of my\r\nmarried life I had to go out. My Lord’s eldest daughter was married\r\nthree years after I married my Lord, and four years after, Soph, his\r\nsecond girl, was married; and then very soon there was my own girl to\r\ntake out. Oh, how I hated it, but I never let my Lord know what I felt.\r\nWe dined with him, and afterwards there was his whist, or people came to\r\nsee him, and at ten o’clock he went to bed; then I went to my daily task\r\nof dressing to take the girls out, and sometimes I fairly cried as I was\r\ndressing.\r\n\r\n“‘I was always up so late at night that I breakfasted in my own room,\r\nbut there was always breakfast downstairs for the girls and Auntie--for\r\nmy Lord’s elder sister, Miss Copley, always lived with us. Auntie was no\r\ntrouble in the house, and I was very fond of her, for she perfectly\r\nadored my Lord. When I married, people wondered at my wishing to have my\r\nsister-in-law to live with me, but I said, “Bless you, have I not been\r\nbrought up in France, where whole families live together, and have to\r\naccommodate themselves to each other? and it would be hard indeed if I\r\ncould not get on with poor old Auntie, when she is so fond of my Lord.”\r\n\r\n“‘It was at the marriage of my daughter to Sir Charles Du Cane that my\r\nLord said he had nothing left to live for, his work was done. He\r\ncomforted me by telling me that he was so very old--and so he was,--and\r\nthat if he lived he must become helpless, and so perhaps would be\r\nunhappy, and then perhaps even his mind might go. He said, “You will\r\ntake care of Auntie?” and I said, “Of course I will,” and Auntie was\r\nalways with me afterwards, and I loved her dearly, and she died in this\r\nvery room at ninety-three. She was always well and cheerful, but one day\r\nshe asked for her cup of tea as usual, and afterwards she--fell\r\nasleep,--she was so very old.\r\n\r\n“‘My dear Lord was very old too when he died, but to me he was always\r\nlike a young man, he was so bright and cheerful and so kind--always the\r\npleasantest of companions. However, I could believe it was time that he\r\nshould go, because _he_ told me so.\r\n\r\n“‘That is the story of my life, Mr. Hare, and now I am only waiting,\r\nhoping that some day,--perhaps some day not very far off,--I may see my\r\ndear Lord again.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Athenæum Club, Dec. 13._--Sir G. Dasent, sitting at the next table at\r\nbreakfast this morning, said, ‘I see you always sit in the historical\r\ncorner.’--‘Do I? how?’--“Why, it is the place where Sam Wilberforce\r\nalways sat (behind the door leading to the kitchen), and so did Theodore\r\nHook. It was from that corner that, when he had finished two bottles of\r\nport, he used to be heard calling out “Waiter, lemonade: bring more\r\n_lemonade_.” And they all knew what it meant: he hadn’t the face to ask\r\nfor another bottle of port.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Heckfield Place, Dec. 30._--I have had a pleasant visit here, meeting\r\nSir Erskine May, a most winning and agreeable person. He revived for me\r\nthe old story of Mrs. Blomfield, who forgot her Royal Academy ticket for\r\nthe ‘private view,’ and, when they tried to prevent her coming in, said,\r\n‘Oh, but you must let me pass: I am the Bishop of London’s lady.’--‘No,\r\nMa’am, I could not let you in,’ said the doorkeeper, ‘if you were the\r\nBishop of London’s _wife_.’\r\n\r\n“We went with Lord Eversley to see Bramshill, one of the places intended\r\nfor Prince Henry, a most noble and beautiful old house.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 13, 1882._--With Ronald Gower and Hugh Pearson over the three\r\ngreat houses of London in the same morning. Grosvenor House is the\r\npleasantest to live in, but Stafford House the most magnificent. When\r\nthe Queen was being received there by the late Duchess, she said, with\r\nher happy power of expression, ‘I come, my dear, from my house to your\r\npalace.’\r\n\r\n“Hugh Pearson talked of Archbishop Longley’s singular tact in saying the\r\nright thing. Some one asked him what tact was. He said, ‘It will be\r\ndifficult for me to describe what it is, but I will give you an instance\r\nof what it is _not_. This morning I received a letter from a clergyman\r\nbeginning--“In consideration of your Grace’s many infirmities and\r\nfailing powers.” Now the beginning of that letter was not tact.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 14._--To Lady Lyndhurst, whom I found in her room ill, and in\r\ngreat grief for the death of General Macdonald, her oldest friend, ‘who\r\nwas the pleasantest, frankest, and handsomest of young men when I first\r\ncame to England, and whom everybody has liked ever since. He was so well\r\nknown, that when Mrs. Norton directed a letter to him “Jem at his Club,”\r\nthe postman made no difficulties at all, but took it straight to him at\r\nWhite’s. There have been several pleasant notices of him in the papers\r\nsince his death, but they have all committed the fatal blunder of\r\ncalling him “Jim,” the thing of all others he would have disliked--he\r\nwas always Jem with an _e_.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Athenæum, Feb. 3._--Sir G. Dasent sat by me at breakfast. He described\r\nhow he had almost bought the famous Vercelli MS. for £150, when ‘a\r\nstupid old canon interfered, and thought it ought not to be taken out of\r\nthe place. It was taken to Italy from England by a Cardinal S. Andrea,\r\nwho was tutor to Henry II., and who collected everything relating to St.\r\nAndrew, because of his name, and the MS. begins with the legend of St.\r\nAndrew. It ought some day to be restored to England by an interchange,\r\nEngland sending over some Italian MSS.; and now that it has been\r\nremoved to the National Collection, this has been facilitated.’\r\n\r\n“Sir G. Dasent talked of St. Olaf again. ‘He is what I call a good\r\nwearing saint, for he has lasted nine hundred years. It was just when\r\nSt. Olaf was “coming up” that Earl Godwin and his sons were banished for\r\na time. Two of them, Harold and Tosti, became Vikings, and in a great\r\nbattle they vowed that, if they were victorious, they would give half\r\ntheir spoil to the shrine of St. Olaf, and a huge silver statue which\r\nthey actually gave existed at Throndjem till 1500, and, if it existed\r\nstill, would be one of the most important relics in archaeology. The old\r\nkings of Norway used to dig up the saint from time to time and to cut\r\nhis nails. When Harold Hardrager was going to England, he declared he\r\nmust see St. Olaf again--“I must see my brother,” he said: and he also\r\ncut the saint’s nails. But then he thought that from that time it would\r\nbe better that no one should see his brother any more--it would not be\r\nfor the good of the Church; so he took the keys of the shrine and threw\r\nthem into the fiord; but at the same time he said that it would be a\r\ngood thing for men who came after to know what a king was like, and he\r\ncaused St. Olaf’s measure to be engraved upon the wall of the church at\r\nThrondjem--his measure of six feet.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 21._--I sat at dinner by Mrs. Duncan Stewart, who talked with her\r\nusual power. ‘When I was young, I lived with my guardian and his wife at\r\nHavre de Grâce, and thence I married Mr. Duncan Stewart, who was a\r\nBaltic merchant, a prosperous and well-to-do man then, though he was\r\nruined afterwards. We lived in Liverpool; but my husband loved hunting\r\nand fishing, and at certain times of the year he was “away after the\r\ngrouse,” as every Scotchman is. I stayed with my children then, but I\r\ntoo had my time of the year for going away, and I always went to London,\r\nwhere I became very intimate with Lady Blessington and all that set--a\r\nvery bad set, it must be allowed.\r\n\r\n“‘One day when I was sitting alone in my house in Liverpool, and my\r\nhusband was away with the grouse, a note of introduction was brought in\r\nfor me from Mrs. Milner Gibson, whom I had known in London, with the\r\ncards of Mr. and Mrs. Disraeli. He was a young man then, all curly and\r\nsmart, and his wife, though so much older than himself, was a very\r\nhandsome, imperial-looking woman. I told them that I should be delighted\r\nto show them everything in Liverpool, as Mrs. Milner Gibson asked me.\r\n\r\n“‘When I went to see them next day at the hotel, I asked Mrs. Disraeli\r\nhow she had slept, and she said, “Not at all, for the noise was so\r\ngreat.” Then I said, “Why not move to my house, for my house is very\r\nquiet, and I am alone, and there is plenty of room?” And they came, and\r\na most delightful ten days I had. We shut out Liverpool and its people,\r\nand we talked, and we became great friends, and when we parted it was\r\nwith very affectionate regard on both sides; and afterwards they wrote\r\nto me every week, and when I went to London, my place was always laid at\r\ntheir table, and if I did not appear at their dinner, they always asked\r\nme why I had not come to them.\r\n\r\n“‘After she died, we drifted apart, he and I, and though I saw him\r\nsometimes, it was never in the old intimate way. The last time I saw him\r\nthough, we had a really good talk together. It was not till we were\r\nparting that I said to him, “I hope you are quite well,” and I shall\r\nnever forget the hollow voice in which he said to me, “_Nobody_ is quite\r\nwell.” After that I never saw him again, but I had a message from him\r\nthrough William Spottiswoode. “Tell Mrs. Stewart always to come to talk\r\nto me when she can: it always does me good to see her.”’\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Duncan Stewart described Lady Beaconsfield as originally a\r\nfactory-girl. Mr. Lewis first saw her going to her factory, beautiful,\r\nand with bare feet. He educated her and married her, died, and left her\r\nvery rich, and then she married Disraeli. When asked _why_ she married\r\nher second husband, she would say, as if it was a feather in her cap,\r\n‘My dear, he made love to me whilst my first husband was alive, and\r\ntherefore I know that he really loved me.’\r\n\r\n“It was at ‘Greenmeadow,’ a house four miles from Llandaff, that\r\nDisraeli served his apprenticeship as secretary to Mr. Lewis, living in\r\nthe house with him and Mrs. Lewis in the position of a dependant. When\r\nthe house overflowed with visitors from London, as was often the case,\r\nhe was sent out to sleep at ‘The Holly Bush,’ a little public-house in\r\nthe village. Both Greenmeadow and the Holly Bush exist still.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of March I again left England for Italy. I could not endure\r\nleaving Holmhurst and my dear old nurse, but it seemed necessary to go\r\nto finish collecting materials for my book on Southern Italy, as there\r\nwere still so many places which I had not seen. At Rome I paid an\r\ninteresting visit to the blind Duke of Sermoneta, still full of mental\r\nvigour, and of indignation at “la stupidézza del Vaticano e l’infámia\r\ndel Quirinale.” Miss Garden had been to see him, and defended the policy\r\nof the Quirinal, saying Italy was a young country, would come round, &c.\r\nHe retorted, “If you say that from politeness, as I think you do, you\r\nare wrong; but if you really think so, you must be an idiot.” This was\r\nmy last visit to the kind old Duke, for he died in the following autumn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAKE OF AVERNUS, NEAR NAPLES.][367]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPRI.][368]\r\n\r\nAt Naples, returning at night from the hotels in the lower town to those\r\non the ridge of the hill, a gentleman engaged me in conversation and\r\nstrolled along by my side. Suddenly, in the most desolate part of the\r\nroad, he blew a whistle, and another man leapt out of the bushes, and\r\nboth rushing upon me demanded “L’orológio e la bórsa.” I declared that I\r\nhad neither watch nor purse. They insisted on my turning out all my\r\npockets, which contained only three francs in paper and sixteen soldi in\r\ncopper. Then they demanded my ring. I refused, and said it was no use\r\nfor them to try to get it; it had not been off my finger for more than\r\nthirty years: it would not come off. They struggled to get it off, but\r\ncould not. Then they whispered together. I said, “I see what you mean to\r\ndo: you mean to cut off my finger and then drop me into the sea (which\r\nthere--opposite the Boschetto--is deep water); but remember, I shall be\r\nmissed and looked for.”--“No, we took good care to ascertain that\r\nfirst,” said my first acquaintance; “you said you had only been two days\r\nin Naples (and so I had): people who have been only two days in Naples\r\nare never missed.”--“But I do know Naples well--bisogna esaminarmi sopra\r\nNapoli,” I protested. “Dunque chi fu la Principessa Altamonti?”--“Fu\r\nfiglia del Conte Cini di Roma, sorella della Duchessa Cirella.”--“E chi\r\nè il Principe S. Teodoro.”--“Fu Duca di S. Arpino, se maritava con una\r\nsignora Inglese, Lady Burghersh, chi sta adesso Lady Walsingham.” After\r\nthis they decided to let me go! But the strangest part of all was that\r\nthe first brigand said, “After this scene you will not be able to walk\r\nhome, and a carriage from the _guardia_ costs sixty centesimi; therefore\r\nthat sum I shall give you back,” and they counted twelve soldi from the\r\nsum they had taken. It is this fact which makes me speak of the men who\r\nattacked me at Naples as brigands, not as robbers.\r\n\r\nI spent a few days delightfully in beautiful Capri, but most miserable\r\nwere my after travels in the desolate wind-stricken plains or\r\nmalaria-teeming swamps of wretched Calabria, of which I had formed a\r\nlofty estimate from Lear’s almost wholly imaginary drawings. Each place\r\nI had to visit seemed uglier and more poverty-stricken than the last,\r\nbut perhaps came to a climax at Cotrone, where the windowless prison-van\r\n(being the only vehicle in the town) was sent to meet us, arriving by\r\nthe night-train at the distant desolate station, and where the stairs of\r\nthe hotel were crowded with beggars, who had nowhere else to sleep,\r\nlying in heaps, and swarming with vermin.\r\n\r\nI see that I wrote to Miss Leycester--“Calabria was indescribably\r\nhorrible, its poisonous swamps and arid plains too hideous for words:\r\nnothing whatever but dry bread to eat: the so-called inns the filthiest\r\nof hovels: the people ruffians: the remains of the Greek cities a few\r\nstones apiece.” I pushed on to Reggio and Scilla. But soon I became so\r\nill that I fled to Venice, where I was fit for nothing but to float in\r\na gondola on the breast of ocean till I grew better.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCILLA.][369]\r\n\r\n“_Venice, April 25, 1882._--It was by a happy accident that I found\r\nmyself here on St. Mark’s Day. Madame von Usedom[370] called for me in\r\nher gondola, and we went together to S. Marco at 10 A.M. Most glorious\r\nit looked, glints of sunlight falling here and there on the golden\r\nwalls and waving peacock-hued pavement, and violet shadows resting on\r\nall the inner recesses of arcades and cupolas, through which the grand\r\nmosaic forms of the saints were dimly visible. Crowds of people were\r\npresent, yet in that vast space many thousands can move with ease. It is\r\nonly a few days since the Patriarch, newly elected and a cardinal,\r\nentered Venice in triumph, followed by three hundred gondolas, standing\r\nat the prow of his barge, in his new scarlet robes, blessing the people.\r\nHe is a young man, but is greatly beloved,[371] and every eye followed\r\nhim as the grand procession swept chaunting round the church, and he was\r\nalmost borne along by his huge golden robes, held up by the white-mitred\r\nattendant bishops of Chioggia and Torcello.\r\n\r\n“I returned afterwards with the Usedoms to luncheon, and Madame von\r\nUsedom talked, as usual, of the great change which is sweeping over\r\nreligious belief, but of how, in most thinking minds, the great\r\nessentials remained untouched. She had told Tholuck that she was\r\ntroubled about her belief in the Trinity. He replied that in being so\r\nshe confounded Religion with Theology: that the doctrine of the Trinity\r\nwas a purely theological question, and not the least necessary to\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n“In the afternoon the Comtesse de Lützow took me to see Besarel, a very\r\nremarkable self-taught genius, and a very good simple man and sculptor\r\nin wood and marble: and then we floated peacefully for hours through the\r\nlabyrinthine streets of this wonderful water-city. In the evening, as I\r\nwas sitting with the Lützows and Lady Augusta Cadogan at one of the\r\ntables in the piazza in front of Florian’s caffè, a table near was\r\noccupied by a party in which the conspicuous figures were a lady, not\r\nold, but with snow-white hair, and a very beautiful young woman, sipping\r\n_graniti_ and listening to the music: they were Queen Mary and Princess\r\nMary of Hanover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM THE CAMPO DELLA CARITÀ.][372]\r\n\r\n“And all this late evening, as I am sitting up writing, a monotonous\r\nsong is wafted through the windows from the boats on the canal--\r\n\r\n    ‘One sombre sweet Venetian slumbrous tune,’\r\n\r\nas J. A. Symonds calls it.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI returned to England by way of Nüremberg, which seemed to me strangely\r\nsmaller and less interesting than when I saw it as a boy, and was more\r\nthankful than ever before to find myself again, on the 10th of May, at\r\nHolmhurst, where my dear old Lea’s most sweet and beautiful old face\r\nwelcomed me with a brighter smile than ever, and where I spent a happy\r\nmonth alone with her, going back into our “wealthy past,” and living\r\nagain in memory many happy scenes in our long-ago.\r\n\r\nAt Venice a great sorrow had come to me--another blank in the narrowing\r\ncircle of my beloved ones. It was the sort of sorrow from which “all at\r\nonce one awakes and finds a whole wing of one’s palace has fallen,” as\r\nEmerson says. Dearest Hugh Pearson was dead. He was altogether the most\r\nperfectly good man I have ever known, and, strange to say, at the same\r\ntime the most perfectly charming. He was, from his earliest youth, as\r\nfree from self-consciousness as he was from selfishness, but rippled\r\nover with geniality, cordiality, warmth of interest, affection to all\r\naround him. He was really, not nominally, the father of his parish, and\r\nI believe there was scarcely one of his parishioners who was not fonder\r\nof him than of most of their own nearest relations. To the children of\r\nhis village he was simply adorable, and his manner to them, his fun, his\r\nsympathy, his solicitude, the prettiest and most enchanting thing\r\nimaginable. “He was like James amongst the Apostles, who wrote nothing\r\nat all, and said nothing we know, and yet was one of the chosen three\r\nwho were with the Master that day when His glory was revealed, and that\r\nnight when His soul was exceeding sorrowful, even unto death. Trust came\r\nto him; he never sought it. He was at home in the human heart, but he\r\nnever seemed to probe it.”[373]\r\n\r\nI suppose dear Hugh Pearson was very ugly, but one loved him so much,\r\none thought there was no face like his. Though he was so very much older\r\nthan I was, there was no one with whom I was more intimate, and nothing\r\nI would not have confided to him. His goodness, his religion, were\r\nequally attractive and charming to all. One never felt with him as if\r\nGod had been rather unfortunate in His good intentions. His christian\r\nspirit christianised everything it came in contact with. His memory is a\r\npossession, and I may exclaim like the Duke of Ormonde, “I would not\r\nexchange my dead friend for any living friend in Christendom.” In the\r\nlater years of his life, he had yielded to urgent request in accepting a\r\ncanonry at Windsor, where I had delighted to visit him; but his heart\r\nwas always in his country vicarage of Sonning on the Thames, and with\r\nhis dear people there. He had refused the Queen’s persistent offer that\r\nhe should succeed Arthur Stanley at Westminster, saying that he wished\r\nto die as he had lived--“a private person.”\r\n\r\nThe end came suddenly. On Easter Sunday (April 9) he told his people\r\nthat it was his fortieth Easter Sunday amongst them, but he was taken\r\nill whilst he was preaching, and two days after mortification came on.\r\nOn Wednesday, the last evening of his life, when it was known that there\r\nwas no hope of saving it, he desired that all his people--his true\r\nchildren--might be admitted to see him once more, and for three hours\r\nmultitudes of his parishioners, men, women, and children, passed weeping\r\nthrough his room. He was able to speak separately to many of them, to\r\ngive them all his blessing, and with a message of peace--the last\r\neffort of his great loving heart--upon his lips, he passed into the\r\nperfect life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rev. Hugh Pearson.\r\n\r\nFrom a Photograph.]\r\n\r\nHe has left the most undimmed memory it is possible for man to leave. To\r\nnone of those who knew him is it possible that there can be even a\r\nbreath upon the mirror of his perfectly beautiful and lovable life. To\r\nno one could the words of Dante be applied with greater truth:--\r\n\r\n    “E se’l mondo sapesse il cor ch’ egli ebbe,\r\n        Assai lo loda e più lo loderebbe.”\r\n\r\n“O ye holy and humble men of heart, praise Him and magnify Him for\r\never.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_London, June 4, 1882._--In the last week I have spent three pleasant\r\ndays with the Husseys at Scotney, a lovely place, where an old tower of\r\nRichard the Second’s time and a ruined house by Inigo Jones stand in a\r\nwooded hollow, surrounded by a moat so clear that its reflections are\r\neven brighter than the reality. On the hill above is a handsome modern\r\nhouse with a glorious garden of azaleas and herbaceous flowers formed\r\nout of an old quarry. Here at this season ‘tout fourmille de vie,’ as\r\nBuffon would say. In the Roman Catholic persecution a priest was long\r\nimprisoned in the dungeon of the old tower, but escaped by persuading\r\nhis gaolers that robbers had broken into the stables and were carrying\r\noff the horses, and by swimming across the moat whilst they were gone to\r\nthe rescue.\r\n\r\n“The whole country-side is full of traditions of smuggling days.\r\nGoudhurst church, which crowns a steep hill-set village on the horizon\r\nof hills opposite Scotney, was fortified by smugglers, who held out\r\nthere for three days against the military sent against them in George\r\nthe Third’s time. They were forced to capitulate at last and a number of\r\nthem were executed, one of them, no one knows why, being afterwards\r\nburied under the hearthstone in one of Mr. Hussey’s cottages. This siege\r\nof Goudhurst church is described in James’s novel. One of the best\r\nremembered instances of successful smuggling was when a great funeral\r\nwas announced as arriving from the Continent. A gentleman, who had died\r\nin France, and who had lived far on the other side of London, was being\r\ntaken home to be buried with his ancestors. A hearse with four horses\r\nmet the coffin at Dover. Relays of horses were ordered, and they were\r\nchanged at Ashford, at Lamberhurst, and several other places. But the\r\nfuneral never went beyond London, for the coffin was full of lace, which\r\nwas soon dispersed over the city.\r\n\r\n“To the same wild times belongs the story of the outlawed Darrell, a\r\nformer owner of Scotney. News came that he had died abroad, and his body\r\nwas brought home to be buried at his native place. Great was the\r\nconcourse of neighbours and acquaintance at his funeral, but amongst the\r\nmourners was a tall figure wrapped in a cloak, who, as the body was\r\nlowered, said, ‘That is not me!’ to the mourner who stood nearest to the\r\ngrave, and immediately disappeared.\r\n\r\n“A few years ago, Mr. Hussey mentioned the tradition that Darrell had\r\nattended his own funeral to the old sexton, and asked if he could throw\r\nany light upon it. He said, ‘Yes, forty years ago, when your uncle was\r\nburied, the coffin next to which he was placed was that of Mr. Darrell,\r\nwhich was falling to pieces, and so I looked into it, and was surprised\r\nto see no remains whatever of a body, but only fragments of stone.’\r\n\r\n“On the first day of my visit an old Lady Smith Mariott dined, bringing\r\nwith her a magic crystal ball, in which she was very anxious that we\r\nshould ‘see something,’ and was greatly disappointed when we did not.\r\nThe ball was given to her by the old Lord Stanhope,[374] a firm\r\nbeliever, and many strange things had been seen in it--figures, and\r\nsometimes figures in armour. Mr. Hussey heard of a curious\r\nsixteenth-century MS. on magic balls in the British Museum, and went to\r\nlook at it, and it was strange to find it say that ‘men in armour\r\nfrequently appeared, especially on Sundays.’\r\n\r\n“In the evening the conversation turned on witchcraft, and on Mr.\r\nMaitland, author of the ‘Church in the Catacombs,’ chaplain of\r\nArchbishop Howley, who undertook to prove the absurdity of belief in\r\nwitchcraft, but, on examination, found such incontrovertible evidence of\r\nits reality, that he abandoned the subject. Talk of strange relics led\r\nto mention of the heart of a French king preserved at Nuneham in a\r\nsilver casket. Dr. Buckland, whilst looking at it, exclaimed, ‘I have\r\neaten many strange things, but have never eaten the heart of a king\r\nbefore,’ and, before any one could hinder him, he had gobbled it up, and\r\nthe precious relic was lost for ever. Dr. Buckland used to say that he\r\nhad eaten his way straight through the whole animal creation, and that\r\nthe worst thing was a mole--that was utterly horrible.[375]\r\n\r\n“Speaking of Lady Waterford, led Mr. Hussey to recall some of the wild\r\nescapades which he remembered in Lord Waterford’s youth. At one time,\r\nwhen he was living in Dublin with his uncle the Primate, coming home\r\nlate at night, he had a great quarrel with his carman about the fare,\r\nand left the man swearing outside the door. Coming into the hall, he\r\nfound his uncle’s gown and trencher lying on the side-table, and putting\r\nthem hastily on, and going out with a stick and gruff voice, said, ‘What\r\ndo you mean by coming here and trying to cheat my nephew? I’ll teach you\r\nnot to do such things for the future,’ and he thrashed him soundly. The\r\nman went away, saying that he had been thrashed by the Archbishop of\r\nArmagh in person.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_London, June 22._--Tea with Mrs. Duncan Stewart, who, talking of her\r\nyouth, recounted how Washington Irving had taken her eleven nights\r\nconsecutively to see Talma act, and of the acting of Madame Rachel;\r\nhow, in the ‘Cinna’ of Corneille, she sat quietly in a chair whilst all\r\nthe people were raging round her, and of the wonderful power with which\r\nshe hissed out--\r\n\r\n    ‘Je recevrois de lui la place de Livie,\r\n     Comme un moyen plus sur d’attenter à sa vie.’\r\n\r\n“Mr. and Mrs. Kendal were there, a pleasant handsome pair; and Madame\r\nModjeska came in, and taking a live chameleon, which was clinging to the\r\nbreast of Miss Thompson, her pet, posed with it perched on her finger,\r\nthough it looked the very incarnation of devildom.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 23._--Drew with Windsor and the Husseys at Ham House. Lady\r\nHuntingtower had said to us the other day, ‘You have heard about the\r\npoor Duke of Richmond?’ We thought it was the live Duke, and inquired\r\nanxiously after him, but she said, ‘No, it is the portrait at Ham: we\r\ncan see nothing but the Duke’s legs now.’ And thus at Ham we saw it--the\r\nutter ruin of a glorious Vandyke. They had sent for a common upholsterer\r\nfrom Richmond to varnish it, and he had covered it with something which\r\nhad annihilated it altogether.\r\n\r\n“An American being urged to go to see the Park at mid-day as a typical\r\nLondon scene, returned saying, ‘I was disappointed, the attendance was\r\nso slim.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 5, 1882._--Dined with Miss Courtenay. Kinglake of the Crimea sat\r\nclose to me--old now and very feeble, but apparently greatly beloved by\r\nthose who know him well. Mr. Burton was on the other side, receiving\r\ncongratulations on his purchases at the Hamilton sale. We had all been\r\nreading and generally enchanted with Mrs. Kemble’s ‘Later\r\nReminiscences,’ and Mr. Reeve of the _Edinburgh Review_ was delighted to\r\nhave much to say of his personal remembrance of her, much that certainly\r\nwas not favourable. She says little of the separation from her husband\r\n(Mr. Butler) in her book, but Mr. Reeve remembered her intensely\r\noverbearing manner to him. Once when he was travelling with them in\r\nBelgium, Mr. Butler, with great difficulty, procured a very beautiful\r\nbouquet for her for the evening. He gave it to her. ‘I have been all\r\nover the town, my dear, to get this bouquet for you,’ he said. She\r\nsniffed at it, said contemptuously, ‘There are no gardenias in this\r\nbouquet,’ and threw it to the back of the fire.\r\n\r\n“‘One day,’ said Mr. Reeve, ‘I was talking to Mr. Butler at a party,\r\nwhen she came up with “Pearce, I want to go.”--“In a minute, my dear.”\r\nIn another moment she came again with “Pearce, I want to go\r\ndirectly.”--“Very well, my dear,” and he prepared to order the carriage.\r\nI said, “It is cruel of you to take him away just now; we were having a\r\nvery deep conversation,” and I shall never forget the contemptuous tone\r\nin which she said, “Deep, with--Pearce!”\r\n\r\n“‘Mrs. Kemble always disliked those who were afraid of her, but she\r\nhated those who were not.\r\n\r\n“‘She loved scenic effect, and so did her sister Adelaide, who was her\r\nsuperior in many ways. When their father took his leave of the stage,\r\nall the audience wept; but Fanny and Adelaide, who had the stage-box,\r\nleant forward as much as possible over the side and wept copiously with\r\ntheir pocket-handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATEWAY, KENSINGTON PALACE.][376]\r\n\r\n“‘No one could do the Semiramide now, but Adelaide was sublime in it.\r\nShe was very grand in the Norma, but in the Semiramide no one ever came\r\nup to her.

He is an immense man, almost gigantic, and\r\nvery handsome, and had a magnificent boar-hound with him--a very prince\r\namongst dogs. He asked if I spoke Spanish. I said that I had spoken it\r\nin Spain, but was afraid of venturing upon it in London. So then he\r\nproposed Italian, in which it was easy to get on with him.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Chevening, July 15._--Yesterday I came here to a house where I have\r\nmuch memory of past kindness, and where I find the young Lord and Lady\r\nStanhope eminently desirous of carrying it on.

Afterwards, sitting on the stone platform in front\r\nof the house, Sir Stafford Northcote told us--\r\n\r\n“‘The great A. B. was tremendously jostled the other day in going down\r\nto the House. A. B. didn’t like it. “Do you know who I am?” he said; “I\r\nam a Member of Parliament and I am Mr. A. B.”--“I don’t know about\r\nthat,” said one of the roughs, “but I know that you’re a damned\r\nfool.”--“You’re drunk,” said A.

Lady Enfield\r\nwas there, with white hair turned back high on her head, like a Sir\r\nJoshua in real life. Mr. Newton was very amusing with his riddles:--\r\n\r\n                ‘My first Gladstone loves,\r\n                My second Gladstone hates:\r\n    My whole, pronounced slow, is what Gladstone wishes:\r\n    My whole, pronounced quick, is where Gladstone ought to be.’\r\n                                  Answer, _Reformatory_.\r\n\r\n“On the Greeks sending marble for a bust of Gladstone, he related the\r\nlines:--\r\n\r\n    ‘When Woolner’s hand, in classic mood, carving the Premier’s pate is,\r\n     Hellas, to show her gratitude, sends him the marble gratis.\r\n     Oh, could this nation, but in stone, repay the gift genteelly,\r\n     This country would send back her own Glad-stone to Hell-as freely.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SASSENPOORT, ZWOLLE.][377]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of September, my friend Harry Lee came to Holmhurst as\r\nusual for his autumn holidays, and, with the wish of giving him change\r\nand pleasure, I took him with me for a fortnight to Holland. We saw the\r\nwhole of that little country, and enjoyed several of the places very\r\nmuch, especially the so-thoroughly Dutch Dort; quiet Alkmaar, with its\r\ncharming old weigh-house; and Zwolle, with its fine old gateway. But the\r\ntour is not one which leaves much interest behind it. There is such a\r\ndisadvantage in not being able to understand what people say, and all\r\nthe Dutch we had anything to do with were so unaccommodating, so\r\nexcessively grasping and avaricious. Besides, all my luggage, registered\r\nthrough to Brussels, disappeared and could not be traced, so that I had\r\nthe odd experience of traversing a whole country with nothing more than\r\na comb and a tooth-brush. Two months afterwards the luggage arrived\r\nquite safe at Holmhurst, covered with labels, quite intact, having made\r\na long tour by itself quite in a different direction from the one we\r\ntook, and without any explanation or any expense.[378]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILL NEAR AMSTERDAM.][379]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Babworth Hall, Notts, Oct. 7, 1882._--I have been spending four\r\npleasant days with kind Mrs. Bridgeman Simpson, to meet old Lady\r\nWestminster,[380] who is the most winning, courteous, and charming of\r\nold ladies, finding something pleasant to say to every one, putting\r\nevery one at their ease, and possessing that real dignity of simplicity\r\nwhich is so indescribably charming. On Wednesday I went with her to\r\nClumber, where we saw the new and very ugly hall, with Italian artists\r\nputting down a mosaic pavement.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday we went by appointment to Welbeck, arriving by the darksome\r\ntunnel, more than two miles long, upon which the late Duke spent\r\n£60,000, and £60,000 more apiece upon banking up (and spoiling) his\r\nsheet of water with brick walls and building a gigantic riding-school.\r\nThe house itself stands well, considering the ugliness of the park, and\r\nis rather handsome. We were shown through a long suite of rooms\r\ncontaining a good many treasures, the most interesting being a glorious\r\nold chest of metal, in which the Bentincks, who came over with William\r\nIII., brought over their jewels. In the last room we found Lady\r\nBolsover, the Duke’s stepmother.\r\n\r\n“The house, vast as it is, has no staircase worth speaking of. The late\r\nDuke lived almost entirely in a small suite of rooms in the old part of\r\nthe house. He inherited the peculiarity of his mother, who would see no\r\none, and he always hid himself. If he gave permission to any one to\r\nvisit Welbeck, he always added, ‘But Mr. So-and-so will be good enough\r\nnot to _see_ me’ (if they chanced to meet). He drove out, but in a black\r\ncoach like a hearse, drawn by four black horses, and with all the blinds\r\ndown; and he walked out, but at night, with a woman, who was never to\r\nspeak to him, and always to walk exactly forty yards in front, carrying\r\na lanthorn. When he went to London, it was in a closed brougham, which\r\nwas put on a railway truck, and which deposited him at his own house at\r\nCavendish Square, his servants all being ordered out of the way: no one\r\never saw him go or arrive. When he needed a doctor, the doctor only came\r\nto the door, and asked questions through it of the valet, who was\r\nallowed to feel his pulse.\r\n\r\n“The Duke’s mania for a hidden life made him build immense suites of\r\nrooms underground, only approachable by a common flight of steps leading\r\nto a long tunnel, down which the dinner is conveyed from the far-distant\r\nkitchen on a tramway. From a great library one enters a billiard-room\r\ncapable of holding half-a-dozen billiard-tables. A third large room\r\nleads to an enormous ball-room, which can contain 2000 people. The\r\napproach to this from above is by means of a gigantic hydraulic drop, in\r\nwhich a carriage can be placed, or twenty persons can be\r\naccommodated--the guests being thus let down to the ball-room itself. A\r\nstaircase through the ceiling of one of the rooms, which is drawn up by\r\na windlass, leads hence to the old riding-school, which is lighted by\r\n1000 jets of gas. Hence a tunnel, 200 yards long, leads to a\r\nquadrangular piece of ground, unbuilt upon, but excavated in preparation\r\nfor a large range of bachelor’s rooms, smoking rooms, and nurseries, to\r\ncover four acres of ground. Another tunnel, three-quarters of a mile\r\nlong, leads thence to the stables, cow-houses, and dairies, like a large\r\nvillage. At the Duke’s death there were ninety-four horses in the\r\nstables, only trained for exercise or feeding. Beyond the stables is a\r\nlarge riding-school, in which there are 8000 jets of gas, an exercising\r\nground under glass, with a gallop on straw and sawdust for a quarter of\r\na mile. Close by is an enormous garden, of which six acres are used for\r\nstrawberry beds, every alternate row being glazed for forcing the\r\nplants. Alongside of this is a glazed wall a quarter of a mile long. The\r\ngarden is about thirty acres in extent, and requires fifty-three men. In\r\nthe late Duke’s time there were forty-five grooms and helpers in the\r\nstables. The cow-houses are palaces, with a covered strawyard attached,\r\nand are surrounded by hydraulic screens, which are let down or raised\r\naccording to the wind. There were eighty keepers and underkeepers.\r\n\r\n“All is vast, splendid, and utterly comfortless: one could imagine no\r\nmore awful and ghastly fate than waking up one day and finding oneself\r\nDuke of Portland and master of Welbeck.\r\n\r\n“Coming home through the tunnel, Mr. Watson told me the curious story of\r\nthe Misses Offley of Norton Hall. These ladies (descended from King\r\nOffa) saw in a vision their only brother, who was with a tutor in\r\nEdinburgh, upon the ridge of the house. Dreadfully alarmed, and\r\nperfectly certain of what they had seen, they went to a neighbour, a\r\nMr. Shore, and told him they were sure that their brother was dead.\r\nUtterly failing to reassure them, in order to comfort them, Mr. Shore\r\nundertook to ride to Edinburgh (it was before the time of railways), and\r\nfind out the truth. As he was crossing the boundary of Yorkshire, he met\r\nthe funeral of the young man, who was being brought back to be buried at\r\nhis own home. However, he went on to Edinburgh to see the tutor, and\r\nthen discovered that, in his illness, young Offley had been persuaded to\r\nmake a will entirely in favour of the tutor and his wife. Mr. Shore at\r\nonce said that he would give the tutor £20,000 if he would give up all\r\nhis claims under this will, but the tutor refused. The next day Mr.\r\nShore went back and offered £10,000, and it was taken. The property was\r\nthen worth £10,000 a year, but is now worth £20,000 a year.\r\n\r\n“Staying here with Lady Westminster is her friend Mrs. Hallyburton\r\n(_née_ Owen, and first married to a Mr. Williams), who is the widow of\r\nJudge Hallyburton--‘Sam Slick.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlas! whilst I was enjoying this Babworth visit, the greatest sorrow\r\nwhich still remained possible for me was preparing, and a few days later\r\nit fell. It would be difficult for any one who had not shared our life\r\nto understand how much my dearest old nurse, Mary Lea, was to me, or the\r\nmany causes which, with each succeeding year, had drawn closer and\r\ncloser the tender tie, as of mother and son, which existed between us.\r\nAnd since 1870 she had been more than ever dear to me--the one precious\r\nlink with _our_ past which no other knew: the only person to whom I\r\ncould talk on all subjects with entire certainty of understanding and\r\nsympathy. Each year, too, had made her more beautiful in her old age,\r\nand there were none who visited Holmhurst and failed to carry away an\r\nattractive remembrance of the lovely old woman, with her pretty\r\nold-fashioned dress and snowy cap, set in the homely surroundings of her\r\nsitting-room, full of pictures and curiosities, or in the poultry-yard,\r\nwhich was her pride and joy, brimming over with quaint proverbs, wise\r\nsayings, and interesting memories.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lea had not forgotten any of the places she had seen, or any of\r\nthe varied circumstances of her life; and these scenes and events formed\r\na mental picture-gallery in the circle of her inner consciousness, where\r\nshe could amuse herself for ever. Life was never monotonous to her;\r\nthere was so much that was beautiful, so much that was good, so much\r\nthat was even grand to recollect; and then the surroundings of the\r\npresent were full of simple pleasures; her room furnished with treasured\r\nmemorials of the long-ago; her farmyard, with its manifold life,\r\nrecalling her girlhood in a Shropshire farmhouse; her many kindly\r\nthoughts and deeds towards her neighbours at the hospice or in the\r\nvillage, one or other of whom loved to come in and chat for an hour\r\ndaily with the beautiful old woman who had so much of mild wisdom in her\r\ndiscourse; her many visitors of the higher class to see the house, in\r\nwhose coming she recognised and welcomed a kind of homage to her beloved\r\nmistress, and to whom consequently she would often pour out the most\r\nprecious of her recollections; the garden and fields, which brought\r\nfresh interest with each succeeding season; but most especially her\r\nmaster, her nursling, the child of her heart, whose every employment, or\r\nfriendship, or amusement, or duty, or work, or honour, was more to her\r\nthan anything else in the world.\r\n\r\nIn this year especially I had been much with her, and the elder and\r\nyounger relation seemed almost obliterated in the intimacy of our\r\nfriendship and communion. Daily I used to take a little walk with my\r\nsweet old nurse upon my arm, and the upper path leading to the little\r\npool above the field will always be connected with her, walking thus,\r\nand recalling a thousand memories out of the rich past, which was common\r\nto us, and to us alone. Here I walked with her the day before I went to\r\nBabworth, and am thankful that I did not give up doing so because a\r\nyoung man was staying with me. She seemed even more calmly happy than\r\nusual that day. Autumn tints and tones were pervading everything, but\r\nwhen I spoke of our seeing the plants again in their full beauty in\r\nspring, she said sweetly, “Those who _live_ till the spring will see\r\nthem, dear sir.” There are some lines of Lewis Morris which recall what\r\nmy dear nurse was at this time:--\r\n\r\n    “There is a sweetness in autumnal days,\r\n     Which many a lip doth praise:\r\n     When the earth, tired a little and grown mute\r\n     Of song, and having borne its fruit,\r\n     Rests for a little space ere winter come.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     And even as the hair grows grey\r\n     And the eyes dim,\r\n     And the lithe form which toiled the live-long day,\r\n     The stalwart limb,\r\n     Begins to stiffen and grow slow,\r\n     A higher joy they know:\r\n     To spend the season of the waning year,\r\n     Ere comes the deadly chill,\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     In a pervading peace.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 11, 1882._--Yesterday two terrible telegrams met me when I went\r\nto my breakfast at the Athenæum, telling me that my dearest Lea was\r\ndangerously ill, and bidding me return at once. In half-an-hour I was in\r\nthe train, Ronald Gower travelling with me to Hastings, and an\r\nagonising journey it was. I found the carriage at St. Leonards, having\r\nbeen waiting five hours, with a perfectly hopeless account.\r\n\r\n“Yet I found my dearest old nurse better than I had hoped, able to be\r\nglad to see me, even, though very suffering, to tell me little things\r\nwhich had occurred during my week’s absence. But at night she grew much\r\nworse, and hour after hour I had the anguish of watching, with Harriet\r\nand Mrs. Peters, over terrible suffering, which we were unable to\r\nalleviate. God sends one no discipline so terrible as this. Happy indeed\r\nare those who have only to suffer themselves, not to witness the\r\nsuffering of their dear ones.\r\n\r\n“To-day she is weaker. Yesterday she spoke of ‘when I am better.’ To-day\r\nshe speaks of ‘when I am gone.’\r\n\r\n“I sit all day in her room, watching the beloved beautiful old face,\r\nfanning her, repeating words of encouragement and comfort to her; and\r\nshe always has a smile for me.\r\n\r\n“Outside the window the beautiful laburnum tree which she loves is\r\nshaking off its leaves and preparing for winter, and oh! when its golden\r\nblossoms come again, this dearest friend of my whole life will be away!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Thursday, Oct. 12._--Last night she slept quietly, and her two nurses\r\nby her. I went in and out continually, and she scarcely moved. In the\r\nmorning she was better, and able to sit in the arm-chair near her bed.\r\nIt was the day on which we always used to try to leave for Rome, and she\r\nspoke of it, and this drew her into many pleasant recollections, such\r\nas the dear Mother had on her last day here; of the anemones in the\r\nVilla Doria at Rome, and the especial corners in which the best were to\r\nbe found; of the daisies in the Parco S. Gregorio, and of many happy\r\nhours spent in other favourite places. She also asked after all the\r\ndifferent members of the family, and sent messages to some of them. In\r\nthe afternoon she was so well that, by her wish, I went down to Hastings\r\nto see Ronald Gower, and when I came back, she liked to hear about it.\r\n\r\n“But to-night (9 P.M.) she is weaker and the pain and wheezing have\r\nincreased. I have just read to her, as usual, a litany for the\r\nnight-watches and several other prayers. She said the ‘Amen’ to each\r\nmost fervently, and repeated the ‘Lord’s Prayer’ after me. Afterwards I\r\nspoke of the comfort prayers and hymns were to the Mother in her\r\nillness: ‘Yes, her’s _were_ prayers,’ she said.\r\n\r\n“Then she said, ‘I did not think I should be taken away from you so soon\r\nas this.’ I said, ‘Perhaps, dear Pettie, it may still be God’s will that\r\nyou may be raised up to us again, and this is what we must wish and try\r\nfor.’--‘Yes,’ she answered, ‘and I _do_ try for it--too much perhaps,\r\nmore than is right perhaps; and yet I am quite resigned either to go or\r\nstay: the Lord’s will, that is the best.’\r\n\r\n“Then she said, ‘Open that top drawer and take out a box. There are some\r\nthings in it I wish you to have, things connected with your family which\r\nyou will value, and my large silver brooch; I wish you to keep that. And\r\nI would like you to keep the little bits of chaney that were my\r\nmother’s--the lions, and the little cups and saucers that are in your\r\nMother’s room; she liked to see them, and you will: I do not wish them\r\never to leave this house.’\r\n\r\n“‘Dearest Pettie,’ I said, ‘if it should be God’s will that you should\r\nnot be given back to us, would you wish to be laid by Mother at\r\nHurstmonceaux, or should you be taken to your own mother’s grave at\r\nCheswardine? Whatever you wish shall be done.’ ‘If you please,’ she\r\nmurmured, ‘Hurstmonceaux would be best. I have been always with you. All\r\nmy own are passed away. You are more to me than any one else. I should\r\nwish to be laid near your dear Mother, and then you would be laid there\r\ntoo.’--‘Yes, dear, we should all be together,’ I said.\r\n\r\n“Then she said, ‘You have been _everything_ to me all your life: quite\r\nlike my own child: _all_ that a child of my own could have been.’\r\n\r\n“She always smiles sweetly to see me near her; but she is weaker, and\r\neverything is difficult. As Aurora Leigh says--\r\n\r\n                        ‘The poor lip\r\n    Just motions for a smile, and lets it go.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 14._--Two terrible nights have we passed in trying to alleviate\r\nmy dearest Lea’s great sufferings, but last night especially it was\r\nanguish to hear her moans and to be able to do _so_ little: but I flit\r\nin and out, and whether it is day or night, am seldom many minutes away\r\nfrom her, and I think _that_ is a comfort.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 15._--Last night was better, but all to-day she has been terribly\r\nill. It is such a struggle to breathe through her worn-out frame. I sit\r\nconstantly by her side, and chafe her hands and bathe her forehead, and\r\ncan be quite cheerful for her sake; and she smiles to see me always\r\nthere whenever she wakes. ‘Oh, how good you are to me,’ she said to-day.\r\n‘I cannot be good enough to you, my own dearest Pettie, to you who have\r\nalways been so very good to me.’\r\n\r\n“But I feel, though no one tells me so, that I am sitting in the shadow\r\nof Death.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Monday, Oct. 16._--The doctor says she is sinking. She suffers less\r\nto-day, but is overwhelmed by the pressure on the lungs. I sit\r\nthere--feed her--watch her, and smile.... I can do it for her sake.\r\nThere will be time enough for grief when she cannot be grieved by it.\r\n\r\n“She is all thankfulness,--only afraid of wearing us all out. ‘Thank\r\nThee, O Lord, for my good victuals,’ she said, after taking her glassful\r\nof milk.\r\n\r\n“Last night, waking from her sleep, she said, ‘Oh, I thought I was away\r\nand so very happy, and now I am come back to all this.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Tuesday afternoon, Oct. 17._--She is still here--still suffering. Oh,\r\nmy poor darling! what anguish it is to see her, and how thankful I shall\r\nbe to God now when He will set her free. One can bear to part with one’s\r\nbeloved ones, but their suffering tears one to pieces. How truly Heine\r\nsays, ‘Der Tod ist nichts; aber das Sterben ist eine schändliche\r\nErfindung.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Wednesday, Oct. 19._--Yesterday morning there was agonising pain for\r\nthree hours and then a respite. At 12 A.M. Hubert Beaumont walked in,\r\nhaving come off at once on hearing a hopeless account. He was much\r\nbroken down at seeing his old friend so ill, but full of kindness and\r\nhelp for me and all of us.... All afternoon she was worse. Two doctors\r\ncame.... At night she was terribly worse. Oh, it was so hard to see her\r\nsuffer,--so very, very hard. Soon after midnight I gave dose after dose\r\nof laudanum, and when she was still, lay down--sank down, utterly\r\nworn-out. At 3 A.M. I heard Harriet’s voice, ‘Aunt is gone.’ All was\r\nstill then--the agony lived through, the fight fought. As I rushed into\r\nthe room, the colour was fading out of my darling Pettie’s cheeks, but\r\nher face and hands were still warm. A wonderful look of rest was\r\nstealing over the beloved features. I knelt down and said the bidding\r\nprayer. Truly we ‘gave thanks’ that our dearest one was at rest. Yet I\r\nfelt--oh, so stunned, so helpless! Dear Hubert was a great comfort.\r\n\r\n“All day we have sobbed at intervals. Many touching notes have come in;\r\nbut I have felt dead in body and mind.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 20._--My dearest Lea is laid in her coffin. It has been a day of\r\nbitter anguish. All have tried to console, but\r\n\r\n    ‘Console if you will, I can bear it,\r\n     ’Tis a well-meant alms of breath:\r\n     But not all the preaching since Adam\r\n     Can make Death other than Death.’”[381]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 21._--Hubert has been summoned away by his parents,--very\r\nmiserable to go, poor boy. There has been a terrible storm all day,\r\nwhich has seemed more congenial than the lovely sunshine yesterday.\r\n\r\n“In the evening Mrs. Peters had put lights in the room, and I went to\r\nlook at my dearest Pettie in her coffin. The ‘afterglow’ had come on.\r\nAll her old beauty had come back to her. There was not a wrinkle on her\r\nlovely dignified old face. Her snow-white hair just showed at the edge\r\nof her pretty little crimped cap: all was peace and repose. It comforted\r\nme to see her, and we surrounded her coffin with large branches of\r\nMichaelmas daisies, enlivened by sprays of fuchsia, and the autumn\r\nlilies which she loved.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 23._--In the morning I went into her room to see my dearest\r\nPettie for the last time. Lady Darnley had sent a box of lovely flowers,\r\nand I laid them round her. The marvellous beauty of her countenance\r\ncontinued: it was the most sublime majesty of Death:--\r\n\r\n    ‘That perfect presence of His face,\r\n     Which we, for want of words, call Death.’[382]\r\n\r\n“John[383] came in to see her too, but can think of nothing but his own\r\nfuture. That does not seem to occur to me--not yet: I can think of\r\nnothing but her wealthy past, so rich, so overflowing in deeds of love,\r\nin endearing ways which drew all hearts to her, in noble, simple trust\r\nand faith, in heart-whole devotion and self-abnegation for the Mother\r\nand me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HURSTMONCEAUX CASTLE GATEWAY.]\r\n\r\n“At eleven I set off alone, in a little carriage, by the familiar lanes.\r\nIt was the loveliest of autumnal days, and all was in its richest, most\r\ntouching beauty: the Ashburnham woods; the long Boreham hill, with the\r\ngroup of weird pine-trees called ‘The Crooked Aunts;’ Sybil Filiol’s\r\npaved walk winding by the roadside; Windmill Hill; Lime Cross; Lime;\r\nFlower’s Green and the Mother’s little school; Hurstmonceaux Place; and\r\nthen the ascent to the church through the deep hollow way overhung by\r\nold oaks.\r\n\r\n“Soon after 2 P.M. the little procession appeared over the brow of the\r\nhill, the bearers, in white smock-frocks, walking by the carriages. The\r\ncoffin was laden with flowers, wreaths sent by different friends, and a\r\nlong garland of Michaelmas daisies and laurustinus falling over the\r\nside. I followed the coffin alone first, then all the servants from\r\nHolmhurst and many poor women from Lime Cross.\r\n\r\n“The first part of the service was in the chancel amidst all the old\r\nfamily monuments. The grave was by my Mother’s side, in the same little\r\ngarden enclosure. It was strange to feel that the next funeral there\r\nmust be my own, and to look down upon her coffin on which my own will\r\nrest some day.\r\n\r\n“After the others were gone I walked in the old deer-park. I felt as if\r\nI was a spirit haunting the place. All was peace and loveliness, but how\r\ngreat the change from the time when I was there so constantly! ‘On\r\ndépose fleur à fleur la couronne de la vie.’[384] All the familiar\r\nfigures of my childhood are swept away--all the uncles and aunts,\r\nbrothers and sister; all the old neighbours; nearly all the old friends;\r\nthe dear Mother; Marcus Hare; Arthur and Mary Stanley; and now my own\r\ndear Lea: all the old homes too are broken up, pulled down, or\r\ndeserted; only I and the ruins of the castle seem left.\r\n\r\n                            ‘So live I in spirit,\r\n    Lonely, my hidden life, by none to be known of,\r\n    Never a sound nor cloud-picture but brings to my fancy\r\n    Matter for thought without end and keen-edged emotion.’”[385]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Nov. 14._--The winds are howling round and I sit alone in\r\nmy home. The silence is sometimes awful, for I never hear the human\r\nvoice now, for my only attendant, the faithful Anne, who waits upon me,\r\nis stone-deaf, so that all communication with her is in writing.\r\n\r\n“It may seem odd, but my dear Lea’s removal really makes a greater blank\r\nin my life than even the Mother left behind. My Mother had so long taken\r\nthe child’s place to be loved and taken care of: Lea, to her last hour,\r\ntook as much care of _me_ as in the first year of my life. I have the\r\npiteous feeling that there is none now to whom I _signify_: it can\r\nreally ‘matter’ to no one whether I live or die. My friends are very\r\nkind, and would be sorry to lose me, but in this rapid world-current a\r\nfew days would see them well out of their grief. And my dearest Lea, who\r\ncared--who would have cared while life lasted, rests now under a white\r\nmarble cross like my Mother’s, inscribed--\r\n\r\nMARY LEA GIDMAN,\r\nJune 2, 1800: Oct. 19, 1882.\r\nThrough fifty-four years\r\nDevoted, honoured, and beloved\r\nIn the Hare family.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nIN THE FURROWS OF LIFE\r\n\r\n                          “Days--when gone--\r\n    Gone! they ne’er go; when past they haunt us still.”\r\n                  --EDWARD YOUNG.\r\n\r\n“What used to be joy is joy no longer: but what is pain is easier\r\nbecause they have not to bear it.”--GEORGE ELIOT.\r\n\r\n“To live for the shorter or longer remainder of my days with the simple\r\nbravery, veracity, and piety of her that is gone, that would be a right\r\nlearning from her death, and a right honouring of her memory.”--CARLYLE.\r\n\r\n    “Dieu donne la robe selon le froid.”--PASCAL.\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 1882._--With what a numbed feeling of desolate sadness do I look\r\nback upon the last chapter. My home existence is so intensely changed by\r\nthe blank which the dear old friend of my whole life has left. It was\r\nlong before I could bear to go into her changed rooms, and I still wake\r\nnightly with the sad inward outcry, ‘Can it be--can it be? Is every one\r\ngone who shared _our_ home life? Is there no one left who is associated\r\nwith all our wealthy past?’ ‘Entbehren sollst du--sollst entbehren.’ And\r\nwhen my friends urge me to marry, I feel the utter desolateness of\r\nattempting to make new ties with any one who knows nothing and cares\r\nnothing of those with whom all my earlier life was bound up. I have\r\nhappily still a great power of enjoyment when anything pleasant comes to\r\nme, but oh! how seldom it happens. Griefs and worries--griefs and\r\nworries come round with wheel-like recurrence. I often think of Aubrey\r\nde Vere’s lines:--\r\n\r\n    ‘When I was young, I said to Sorrow,\r\n    “Come, and I will play with thee.”\r\n         He is near me now all day;\r\n         And at night returns to say,\r\n    “I will come again to-morrow,\r\n     I will come and stay with thee.”\r\n\r\n“Archbishop Tait, long a kind friend, is dead. I hear that at his\r\nfuneral, in the beautiful churchyard at Addington, a little robin\r\nperched on an adjoining tombstone and poured forth a flood of song,\r\napparently unconscious of all present. ‘How our father would have liked\r\nto have seen it,’ said one of the daughters.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 12, 1883._--Tea with Dowager Lady Donoughmore,[386] who was very\r\npleasant. She described walking in Ireland with a stingy old gentleman.\r\nA beggar came up to them, and he said, ‘I have not got a penny to give\r\nyou.’ The beggar retorted, ‘You’ve got an awful ugly face: I hope you\r\nmay die soon, but I pity the worms that will have to eat you.’\r\n\r\n“Lady Donoughmore, however, said that she had boundless experience of\r\nthe natural poetry in the Irish peasantry. On receiving a shilling, an\r\nold woman said to her, ‘May ivery hair of yer honour’s head become a\r\ntorch to guide yer sowle to heaven.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 19._--Dined with Lady Airlie, only meeting Mrs. Duncan Stewart\r\nand Lady De Clifford. Mrs. Stewart talked much of Mr. Carlyle.\r\n\r\n“‘Mr. Hannay knew Carlyle very well, and often went to see him, but it\r\nwas in his poorer days. One day when Mr. Hannay went to the house, he\r\nsaw two gold sovereigns lying exposed in a little vase on the\r\nchimney-piece. He asked Carlyle what they were for. Carlyle looked--for\r\nhim--embarrassed, but gave no definite answer. “Well, now, my dear\r\nfellow,” said Mr. Hannay, “neither you nor I are quite in a position to\r\nplay ducks and drakes with sovereigns: what _are_ these for?”--“Well,”\r\nsaid Carlyle, “the fact is, Leigh Hunt likes better to find them there\r\nthan that I should give them to him.”\r\n\r\n“‘I was sitting once by Mr. Bourton,’ said Mrs. Stewart, ‘and he was\r\ntalking of Leigh Hunt. He said, “He is the only person, I believe, who,\r\nif he saw something yellow in the distance, and was told it was a\r\nbuttercup, would be disappointed if he found it was only a guinea.”’\r\n\r\n“Lady Airlie said she had known Leigh Hunt very well when she was a\r\nchild. He had taken her into the garden, and talked to her, and asked\r\nher what she thought heaven would be like, and then he said, ‘I will\r\ntell you what I think it will be like: I think it will be like a most\r\nbeautiful arbour all hung with creepers and flowers, and that one will\r\nbe able to sit in it all day, and read a most interesting novel.’\r\n\r\n“Of her early acquaintance with Washington Irving, Mrs. Stewart said,\r\n‘It was at Havre. My guardian was consul there. People used to say,\r\n“Where is Harriet gone?” and he answered, “Oh, she is down at the end of\r\nthe terrace, busy making Washington Irving believe he is God Almighty,\r\nand he is busy believing it.”’\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Stewart told of Miss Ruth Paget, one of many sisters, who went\r\ndown at night to the kitchen to let out her little dog for a minute, and\r\nfound her brother Marco, who was a midshipman in the Mediterranean,\r\nsitting on the kitchen-table, swinging his legs, but pouring with wet.\r\nShe said, ‘Good heavens, Marco, how did you come here?’ He looked at\r\nher, and only said, ‘Do not tell any one you have seen me.” She looked\r\nround for an instant to see if any one was coming, and when she turned,\r\nhe was gone.\r\n\r\n“Ghastly pale, she went upstairs. Her sisters said, ‘You look as if you\r\nhad seen a ghost,’ and they tried to insist on her telling them what had\r\nhappened to her. She put them off by complaining of headache and\r\nfaintness; but she was terribly anxious.\r\n\r\n“Three months afterwards she heard her brother was coming home, then\r\nthat he had arrived at Portsmouth, then he came. The first time she was\r\nalone with him she said, ‘I must tell you something,’ and she told him\r\nhow he had appeared to her, and then she said, ‘I wrote it down at the\r\ntime, and here is the paper, with the date and the hour.’\r\n\r\n“He looked shocked at first, and then said, that at that very moment,\r\nbeing absent from his ship without leave, his boat had been upset, and\r\nhe had been as nearly drowned as possible--in fact, when he was taken\r\nout of the water, life was supposed to be extinct. His first fear on\r\nrecovering was that his absence without leave would be detected by his\r\naccident and become his ruin, and his first words were, ‘Do not tell any\r\none you have seen me.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 21._--At Madame du Quaire’s I met Oscar Wilde and Mrs. Stewart.\r\nHe talked in a way intended to be very startling, but she startled him\r\nby saying quietly, ‘You poor dear foolish boy! how can you talk such\r\nnonsense?’ Mrs. M. L. had recently met this ‘type of an aesthetic age’\r\nat a country house, and described his going out shooting in a black\r\nvelvet dress with salmon-coloured stockings, and falling down when the\r\ngun went off, yet captivating all the ladies by his pleasant talk. One\r\nday he came down looking very pale. ‘I am afraid you are ill, Mr.\r\nWilde,’ said one of the party. ‘No, not ill, only tired,’ he answered.\r\n‘The fact is, I picked a primrose in the wood yesterday, and it was so\r\nill, I have been sitting up with it all night.’ Oscar Wilde’s oddities\r\nwould attract notice anywhere, but of course they do so ten times more\r\nin the _plein midi_ of London society, where the smallest faults of\r\nmanner, most of all of assumption, are detected and exposed at once.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 2, 1883._--I have just heard again the ghost story so often told\r\nby Mrs. Thompson Hankey:\r\n\r\n“Two beautiful but penniless sisters were taken out in London by an\r\naunt. A young gentleman from the north, of very good family and fortune,\r\nfell in love with one of them, and proposed to her, but she was with\r\ndifficulty persuaded to accept him, and afterwards could never be\r\ninduced to fix a date for their marriage. The young man, who was very\r\nmuch in love, urged and urged, but, on one excuse or another, he was\r\nalways put off. Whilst things were in this unsettled state, the young\r\nlady was invited to a ball. Her lover implored her not to go to it, and\r\nwhen she insisted, he made her promise not to dance any round dances,\r\nsaying that if she did, he should believe she had ceased to care for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“The young lady went to the ball, and, as usual, all the young men\r\ngathered round her, trying to persuade her to dance. She refused any but\r\nsquare dances. At last, however, as a delightful valse was being played,\r\nand she was standing looking longingly on, she suddenly felt herself\r\nseized round the waist, and hurried into the dance. Not till she reached\r\nthe end of the room, very angry, did she succeed in seeing with whom she\r\nhad been forced to dance: it was with her own betrothed. Furious, she\r\nsaid she should never forgive him. But, as she spoke, he disappeared.\r\nShe begged several young men to look for him, but he could not be found\r\nanywhere, and, to her astonishment, every one denied altogether having\r\nseen him. On reaching home, she found a telegram telling her of his\r\ndeath, and when the hours were compared, he was found to have died at\r\nthe very moment when he had seized her for the dance.\r\n\r\n“Mrs Thompson Hankey knew all the persons concerned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE TERRACE, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n“Catherine Vaughan has just been taken to see an old woman in Scotland,\r\nwhose daughter was married last year. She asked if she was getting on\r\nwell. ‘Aye, she’s gettin’ on varra weel, varra weel indeed. She’s got a\r\npig, and she’s got a cock, and she’s got a son: it’s true that she hates\r\nher mon, but one must aye have ae thing.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE KITCHEN, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n“Charlotte Leycester is to be left in possession of my little Holmhurst\r\nwhilst I am away, and has such complete enjoyment of it, that I shall\r\nhave no sense of wasting my home by a long absence, as would otherwise\r\nbe the case.”\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1883, I left England to join my oft-times\r\ntravelling companions, the Miss Hollands, for a tour in Russia. I did\r\nnot greatly enjoy this tour, partly because I felt so terribly knowing\r\nalmost nothing of the language of the country, not being able to read\r\neven the names of the streets. I also suffered from not having had time\r\nto teach myself anything of the country before I went there: for, after\r\nI came home, and tried to instruct my mind by every book I could get\r\nhold of about Russia, I found my travels had been much more interesting\r\nthan, from the very intensity of my ignorance, I believed them to be at\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nAt Kieff I left my companions, and found my way home alone by Warsaw and\r\nby Cracow, with its curious monuments and odious Jew population. After\r\nthe great discomforts of Russia, a very few days in Germany seemed very\r\ncharming, and I was especially glad to see beautiful old Breslau, and\r\nafterwards Wilhelmshohe near Cassel, in a perfect conflagration of\r\nsplendid autumnal tints, truly realising Hood’s lines--\r\n\r\n    “How bravely Autumn paints upon the sky\r\n     The gorgeous fame of Summer which is fled.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_St. Petersburg, August 22, 1883._--A rest in the interesting group of\r\nNorth-German cities, Dantzic, Marienburg, Königsberg, prepared us for\r\nthe thirty-six hours’ journey through monotonous fir-woods and\r\ncornfields, unvaried through 1000 miles, till two great purple domes\r\nrose on the horizon--St. Alexander Newski and the Cathedral of St.\r\nIsaac.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATHEDRAL OF ST. ISAAC, ST. PETERSBURG.][387]\r\n\r\n“It was difficult to believe we were in Europe on emerging from the\r\nstation and seeing the endless droskies--sledges on wheels--drawn up,\r\nwith their extraordinary-looking drivers, in long blue dressing-gowns\r\n(wadded like feather-beds, so as to make the wearer look like a huge\r\npillow), with a girdle, and low cap. Then the gigantic streets, each\r\nabout as broad as St. James’s Square, and the huge squares, in which the\r\npalaces, however vast, are so disproportioned to the immensity of space,\r\nthat their architectural features are lost. Then the utter desolation,\r\none carriage and two or three foot-passengers in the apparently\r\nboundless vistas. Altogether, St. Petersburg is quite the ugliest place\r\nI ever saw, even the Neva, huge as it is, so black and grim, and the\r\nsmoke of the steamers giving the worst aspects of London. But yesterday\r\nevening we had a delightful drive of four hours on the islands in the\r\nNeva, which answer here to the Park, and are exquisitely varied--lovely\r\nwinding alleys, bosquets of flowering trees, green meadows, little\r\nlakes, rushing brooks, every variety of cottage and villa and garden and\r\nbridge, at least twenty miles of them. Coming back, we stopped at the\r\nfortress-church to see the royal tombs--stately marble sarcophagi in\r\ngroups; first Peter the Great and his family, then two groups of\r\nintermediate sovereigns, then the present family, surrounded (inside the\r\nchurch) by a grove of palms and laden with flowers. Close by is Peter\r\nthe Great’s cottage, and the tiny early church in which he worshipped,\r\nand, at the former, the famous ‘icon’ which he carried in his wars,\r\nbefore which crowds of people were incessantly prostrating and kissing\r\nthe pavement.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sept. 4._--We returned last night from Finland, of which I am glad to\r\nhave visited a specimen, though there is not much to see, except gloomy\r\nlittle lakes, flat country, hundreds of miles of monotonous forests of\r\nyoung firs and birch, and little wooden villages. All is very much like\r\nan inferior Sweden, and the people understand Swedish, and have the\r\nSwedish characteristics of honesty and civility, which, at so short a\r\ndistance off, make them an extraordinary contrast to the Russians. Our\r\njourney was amusingly varied by endless changes of rail, steamer, walk,\r\nchar-a-banc, as the country allowed. At Imatra, our destination, a lake\r\ntumbles into a river by curious rapids.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. SOPHIA OF NOVGOROD.][388][Illustration: KREMLIN,\r\nMOSCOW.][389]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW JERUSALEM.][390]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Moscow, Sept. 9._--We left St. Petersburg on Monday, and went to\r\nNovgorod the Great, one of the oldest cities in Russia, once enormous,\r\nbut now dwindled to a large village, with a decaying kremlin and a\r\nwonderful cathedral like a mosque, a blaze of beautiful ancient colour\r\nwithin, quite splendid in its gold and silver decorations, and the\r\nshrines of sixteen famous saints (the Greek saints are most puzzling)\r\nwho are buried there, and whose mummified hands, left outside their\r\ncerecloths, are exposed to the kisses of the faithful. A journey of\r\nnineteen hours’ rail brought us here on Thursday morning. The first\r\nimpression of Moscow is disappointing--commonplace omnibuses at the\r\nstation, ugly vulgar streets like the back-streets of Brighton, and, as\r\nthe town is above twenty miles round and nine miles across, they seem\r\nendless. But you enter the Chinese town, in which we are now living, by\r\ngates in the strangest walls imaginable, and the street has all the\r\ncrowd and clamour of Naples. Another series of very tall battlemented\r\nred walls and lofty gates announces the Kremlin. This is more striking\r\nthan I expected--the three mosque-like cathedrals (there are five\r\ncathedrals and three hundred churches in Moscow), and the splendid view\r\nfrom the high terrace in front of them, which recalls that from the\r\nPincio at Rome, only the Moskva is a very broad river, and every church\r\nhas the strangest of towers--like bulbs, pine-apples, melons, fir-cones,\r\ngilt or blue or brightest green, covered with network, with stars,\r\ndiscs, moons, hung with chains like veils, every device that the wildest\r\ndream or maddest imagination can invent, and yet in this clear\r\natmosphere of intense burning heat and with the arid low hills or burnt\r\nplains which surround the town, it all looks right. Inside, the\r\ncathedrals put all the churches in Italy and Spain to shame by their\r\nsplendour, but one is sorry not to know more of their history. I can\r\nspeak enough Russian now to get on humbly; but the alphabet beats me\r\nstill: it is not only that there are so many letters, but that the old\r\nfamiliar forms of written letters mean something new.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DNIEPER, KIEFF.][391]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOLY CHAPEL OF KIEFF.][392]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Kieff, ‘The Holy City,’ Sept. 21._--We made excursions from Moscow to\r\nall the great monasteries. There are few other sights of importance,\r\nbut these, in Russia, are quite unique--immense spaces surrounded by\r\nwalls, towers, and gates, which have stood many a siege, and which are\r\nlike the towns in old woodcuts, and contain gardens, cemeteries,\r\ncathedrals, usually six churches with gilt domes and minarets, besides\r\naccommodation for 600 or 800 monks and nuns, who have their wells,\r\ngardens, farms, &c. One of those which I thought most attractive was\r\nNovo Devichi, rising from an arid sandy plain close to the town, but\r\nfull of lovely flowers, which a kind old prioress came and gave us\r\nhandfuls of. Then we went to the New Jerusalem, where the famous Nikon\r\nlived and is buried--many hours jolting along a no-road through the\r\nforests in a rough tarantass, but a beautiful place when you get there.\r\nNikon chose it because he thought it so like the real Jerusalem, and\r\nchanged the name of its river to Jordan, and _made_ a Kedron. It was a\r\nquiet countrified spot, and the only one I have seen which the Mother\r\nand Lea would have enjoyed in the old days, and there was a primitive\r\ninn with kindly, gentle people. We also went to the famous Troitsa, the\r\nhome and grave of Philaret. In all these excursions, as everywhere else,\r\nwe found the ‘difficulties’ of Russian travel entire imagination:\r\nnothing can be easier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CITADEL OF CRACOW.][393]\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, the journey to Kieff by a slow train was terrible,\r\nlasting two days and a night, and awfully hot--across a hideous brown\r\nsteppe the whole way, with scarcely a tree to vary it. (There are\r\nforests _till_ Moscow, only steppes afterwards.) I was ill and wretched\r\nenough before this interesting place rose on its low hills above the\r\nDnieper.\r\n\r\n“To-day, however, has quite satisfied me that it was worth while to\r\ncome. It is a most unique and beautiful place, the vast town, or rather\r\nthree great towns, so embosomed in trees and gardens, that the houses\r\nare almost lost. But the greatest charm lies in the constant view over\r\nthe glorious Dnieper, and the immense aërial plain beyond, with its\r\ndelicate pink lights and blue shadows. Then Kieff is the Mecca of\r\nRussia, full of tombs of saints and holy images, and, though this is no\r\nspecial season, the thousands and thousands of pilgrims are most\r\nextraordinary--in sheep-skins and goat-skins, in fur caps, high-peaked\r\nhead-dresses and turbans; in azure blue, bright pink, or pale primrose\r\ncolour. I never could have believed without seeing it the reverence of\r\nthe Russian religion, and it has seemed the same everywhere and in all\r\nclasses. The bowing and curvetting and crossing before the icons is most\r\nextraordinary, and still more so the three prostrations which all make\r\non approaching any holy place, bending down and kissing the dust in a\r\nway worthy of an acrobat, though treated as a matter of course by the\r\ndevotees themselves. But the intense expression of devotion borne by\r\nthese pilgrims (who have often _walked_ from Archangel!) is such as I\r\nhave never seen on other faces, and some of the old men and women\r\nespecially would make the grandest studies for pictures of saintly\r\napostles and matrons. To see a smart young officer unhesitatingly\r\nprostrate himself and kiss the ground on sight of an icon (in the mud of\r\nthis morning even), in the presence of equally smart companions, has\r\nsomething deeply touching in it, and one wonders if any young guardsman\r\nin England would do the same if and because he thought it right.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_In the Warsaw train, Sept. 25._--In this smoothly gliding train, which\r\ntakes one in fifty-four weary hours across the steppes, it is as easy to\r\nwrite as in the study at home. I should be most comfortable if it were\r\nnot that my companion (in the compartment for two) is the most odious\r\ntype of American I ever came across. ‘I guess you will not want to have\r\nthe windows of this carriage opened till you get to Warsaw, because I\r\nwill not submit to it: I am in my right, and I will _not_ submit to it.’\r\n\r\n“We were arrested again yesterday at Kieff, though then only by\r\npriests--veiled priests--for daring to sketch the outside of one of\r\ntheir sacred chapels; but after being hurried about from place to place\r\nfor an hour, and shut up in a courtyard, with a wooden bench to sit\r\nupon, for another, we were regaled with a pile of beautiful grapes and\r\napples, and sent about our business. This constant worrying when drawing\r\nhas really made Russia very tiresome; but for those who do not want to\r\ndraw, I do not see what difficulties travelling in the country can\r\npresent, and Russians are always civil, even when arresting you.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Warsaw, Sept. 27._--We arrived at the junction station of Brest more\r\nthan two hours late, for on some of the Russian lines no hours are\r\nobligatory, and you are quite at the mercy of conductors and their whims\r\nfor spending ten, thirty, or even forty minutes in gossiping at side\r\nstations. So the Warsaw train had left Brest, and we had five hours to\r\nwait for another. Ill and wretched, I left the horrible room where a\r\ncrowd of people were smoking, spitting, and _smelling_, and made my way\r\nto a sort of deserted public garden, where cows were browsing on the\r\nlilacs. Here, from mere want of something to do, I began to sketch some\r\ncottages and bushes, when I was suddenly seized by two soldiers and\r\ncarried off to the guard-house. Here a very furious bombastical old\r\nmajor cross-examined me, and went into a passion over each sketch in my\r\nbook, with volleys of questions about each, and then he sent me with a\r\nmilitary escort to the station to fetch my passport. It was right, of\r\ncourse, and at last, after several hours, I was dismissed with\r\n‘Maintenant c’est fini;’ but after a quadruple walk of two miles each\r\nway, and over such a pavement as only Russia can supply.\r\n\r\n“I never was at Warsaw before, and should not care to stay. The Vistula\r\ndivides the town, which is full of palaces and gardens, but has older\r\nquarters full of Jews, which are like the old streets of Paris. This\r\nafternoon I drove to the old Sobieski palace of Villanov. Two horses\r\nwere necessary, for just outside this capital city the roads are like\r\nthe roughest of ploughed fields.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI spent the autumn of 1883 very quietly at Holmhurst, but paid some\r\nvisits in the winter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Palace, Lichfield, Jan. 1, 1884._--After a pleasant Christmas at\r\nKinmel, I came here yesterday to dear Augusta Maclagan. The immense\r\nquantity of work she does suits her, though it seems too much to those\r\nwho do not know her. Town, Diocese, Chapter, and the society of the\r\nneighbourhood all work the willing horse alike. I cannot sufficiently\r\nadmire the marvellous versatility of the Bishop, or his wonderful power\r\nof conversation, recalling that of Dean Alford in its simplicity and\r\nvivacity. He has led the most varied of lives, and has much of interest\r\nto tell of each part of it. He was for three years a soldier. When he\r\nwas born, the whole house was disturbed by the most fearful row, and\r\nwhen they inquired what it was, the servant said, ‘Eh, it’s just Sandie\r\nand Nellie fighting over the bit bairnie.’ Sandie, who had been military\r\nservant to the father, an army doctor, said it must be brought up as a\r\nsoldier. Nellie said, ‘Nay, it’s the seventh bairn, and if it’s a\r\nsoldier, it must be the Lord’s soldier: the bairn must aye be a\r\nminister;’ and he was both. The Bishop is still passionately fond of\r\nriding and driving, and as soon as he gets out of Lichfield, mounts the\r\nbox of his carriage and drives his own horses, ‘Pride’ and ‘Prejudice.’\r\nHe says people may consider it a terrible thing for a Bishop to be drawn\r\nhither and thither by these passions, but then it is assuredly a fine\r\nthing to have them well under control.\r\n\r\n“The Lonsdales dined last night, and afterwards we sat up for a touching\r\nlittle midnight service in the palace chapel, in which the Bishop\r\npreached, but very briefly, saying just what I have so often felt, that\r\nit is not the expected, but the _unexpected_ events which come with the\r\nNew Year--that God’s hand is full of ‘surprises.’\r\n\r\n“Augusta has written so admirable, so intensely interesting a Memoir of\r\nher dear mother, that I cannot say how delightful I find it, or how\r\nbeautifully it portrays that lovely and lovable life from life to death.\r\nIt is only in MS., though one of the best biographies I ever read--‘the\r\nhistory of a life, not a stuffed animal.’\r\n\r\n“The cathedral is most uniform in its beauty, even the modern monuments\r\nso fine. Of the older ones, the most interesting is that of Bishop\r\nHackett, who was appointed by Charles II. after the destruction caused\r\nby the Puritans. He found the church a ruin, and it is touching to hear\r\nhow he called his choir and the one remaining canon into the only bit\r\nwhich had still a roof, and prayed that he might have life and energy to\r\nrestore it. Going back to his palace, he harnessed his coach-horses to\r\nthe first cart that drew materials for the cathedral, and, though his\r\nincome was so small, he spent £8000 upon it.\r\n\r\n“The statue of our Lord over the west front was put up by the present\r\nBishop in the place of a statue of Charles II., which was due to a Mrs.\r\nWilson. She was of an old Lichfield family, and married far beneath her,\r\na mere mason; but she said to him, ‘Now you are a clever man: you know\r\nhow to carve; make a good statue of his Majesty for the cathedral, and\r\nit will be heard of at court, and you will be knighted, and I shall die\r\n“my lady.”’ And all this actually happened. When the statue of Charles\r\nwas being taken down, the present Dean gave a groan of ‘Poor King\r\nCharles!’--‘Why do you call him poor King Charles?’ said the Bishop.\r\n‘Because he is being dethroned by a _restoration_.’\r\n\r\n“Bishop Selwyn always desired that he might not be buried in the\r\ncathedral, so a little mortuary chapel on the outside was restored for\r\nhim, and you look from the church through arches upon his beautiful\r\nsleeping figure by Adams. When the Maori chiefs were in England, they\r\ncame down especially to see it, and gazed upon it with their eyes\r\nstreaming with tears. ‘They have laid him on a New Zealand mat, as a\r\nchieftain should lie,’ they said.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Fawsley, Jan. 8, 1884._--I came here from Lichfield to find a very\r\nlarge party in this large and most comfortable house, with a hall of\r\nHenry VII.’s time. Sir Rainald Knightley, its owner, is a splendid type\r\nof an English gentleman, very conservative, very courteous, very clever,\r\nand devoted to country sports and interests, which alternate with the\r\npolitics in which his more serious moments are spent. The only blemish\r\non his perfectly happy married life with Miss Bowater, who enters into\r\nall his pursuits, whether duties or pleasures, politics, country\r\nbusiness, hunting, &c., is that they have no children. He is surrounded\r\nby cousins--Charleses and Valentines--repeating in actual life the many\r\nCharleses and Valentines to whom there are monuments in the fine old\r\nchurch near the house. In the autumn, rheumatism takes him to Homburg,\r\nbut he refuses to learn German, ‘the grinding gibberish of the\r\ngarrulous Goth.’\r\n\r\n“The parish has a population of fifty-eight, and there is only service\r\nonce on Sundays, performed by the cousin who is in orders. It is\r\nalternately in the morning and afternoon, the difference being that the\r\nmorning service begins at noon, and the afternoon service at a quarter\r\npast.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Charles Knightley drove me to Canons Ashby, the beautiful and\r\nromantic old place of the eccentric and impoverished Sir H. Dryden. I\r\nthought it looked like the background of a novel, and afterwards found\r\nthat it was the background of--‘Sir Charles Grandison’!\r\n\r\n“Lady Knightley took me to Shackborough--a pretty place. When Charles I.\r\nwas going to the battle of Edgehill he met its proprietor of that day\r\nmerrily hunting. He had never heard that there was a civil war going on,\r\nsuch was the paucity of political news! But he turned about and went\r\nwith the king into the fight and was wounded there.\r\n\r\n“At the beginning of this century, the daughter of the house became\r\nengaged to be married to an officer quartered at Weedon--a mésalliance\r\nwhich was greatly disapproved by her family. At last she was induced to\r\nbreak it off. But the officer persuaded her to grant him one last\r\ninterview at the summer-house on the hill that he might give her back\r\nher letters. He gave her the letters with one hand, and with the other\r\nhe shot her dead, and then shot himself.\r\n\r\n“At Marston St. Lawrence, near this, is an old house, beautiful and\r\nmoated. Here a Mrs. Blencowe was one day being dressed by her maid\r\nbefore the toilet-table. Suddenly she said, ‘Did you see\r\nanything’--‘Yes,’ said the maid. A hand had come out from behind the\r\ncurtain. They had both seen it, and both screamed violently. Help came,\r\nand the room was searched, but no one was there.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Ickwellbury, Jan. 27._--A man here, being asked by Mrs. Harvey how he\r\nliked going to church, said, ‘Well, I like it very much: I goes to\r\nchurch, and I sits down, and I thinks o’ nowt.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_London, Feb. 23._--My dear Mrs. Duncan Stewart is dead. She never\r\nrallied from the sudden death of her son-in-law Mr. Rogerson. But she\r\nwas able to see several people, to whom she spoke with that all-majestic\r\ncharity which was the mainspring and keynote of her life. Her last words\r\nwere ‘Higher, higher!’ and we may believe that she has passed into those\r\nhigher regions where her thirst after life, not repose, meets its full\r\nfruition. I went to see her in the solemn peace of the newly dead, and\r\nlast Thursday I saw her laid in a grave of flowers at Kensal Green, many\r\nfaithful hearts mourning, many sad eyes weeping beside her coffin.[394]\r\n\r\n“There were few equal to her. Mrs. Procter is most so. I met her the\r\nother day, and some one made her a pretty speech. She said, ‘When I was\r\nvery young, Sydney Smith said to me, “My dear, do you like\r\nflattery?”--“Very much indeed,” I answered, “but I do not like it put on\r\nwith a trowel.” What I really do like is--in the words of Sterne--a few\r\ndelicate attentions, not so vague as to be bewildering, and not so\r\npointed as to be embarrassing.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Firle, Lewes, April 18, 1884._--I came here to find a party of twenty\r\nin the house, including Sir Rainald and Lady Knightley. It is a large\r\nhouse, like a French château, close under the downs, but as my kind but\r\nsingular little host, Lord Gage, likes every window open in these bitter\r\nwinds, the cold is ferocious. On Wednesday I got Lady Knightley to walk\r\nwith me (the inhabitants of this place had never heard of it!) 2½\r\nmiles across the marshes to Laughton Place, the ancient and original\r\nresidence of the Pelhams--a moated grange, having an old red brick tower\r\nwith terra-cotta ornaments, and many other curious remains,\r\nlooking--stranded in the desolate fen, and with an abundance of animal\r\nlife--like an old Dutch picture.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday I walked with Sir Rainald to Glynde. It is a curious old\r\nhouse, approached through a gateway and stableyard and by clipped yew\r\nhedges, having a pleasant view over upland country and high gardens. A\r\nfine black oak staircase leads to a noble gallery-room, with deep\r\nalcoves, so pleasantly furnished with fine pictures, &c., that, though\r\nsuitable to an enormous party, a single individual would never feel\r\nsolitary in it. Miss Brand did the honours of the many good portraits\r\nvery pleasantly, and, before we left, Lady Hampden came in from walking,\r\nand I was very glad to see her in her country home, having so often\r\nbeen in her house in the palace at Westminster.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIll-health in June made a happy excuse for my spending a delightful\r\nmonth abroad. I saw first the group of towns around Laon, charming\r\nold-fashioned Noyon, beautiful Soissons, and Coucy with its grand\r\ncastle. Then Alick Pitt met me at Thun, and we spent a delightful time,\r\njoining the Husseys of Scotney Castle at Mürren and Rosenlaui, sketching\r\nand flower-picking, and reawakening every slumbering sense of the\r\ndelights of Switzerland.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Pension Baumgarten, Thun, June 25, 1884._--You will be wishing to hear\r\nfrom this well-remembered place, where the mountains are quite as rugged\r\nand purple, the lake as limpid and still, the river as green and\r\nrushing, and the old town and castle as picturesque, as any youthful\r\nrecollection could paint them. This pension, too, is perfectly\r\ndelightful, with its coloured awnings over the wide terrace, its tubs of\r\npomegranates and oleanders, its garden of roses, and its meadows behind,\r\nwith the wooden châlets and the women making hay, and the delightful\r\npathlets through the dark woods on the mountain-side.\r\n\r\n“I had a calm crossing on Friday, and reached Laon by seven. On Saturday\r\nmorning I saw the stately cathedral at St. Quentin, and spent the\r\nafternoon at Noyon, which has an exquisite cathedral, Calvin’s curious\r\nold house, and a most attractive little inn. Sunday I was at Coucy,\r\nwhere there is the finest ruined château in existence after Heidelberg,\r\nbeautifully situated amongst wooded hills, in scenery so pretty, you\r\nwould take it for the Vosges, not Picardy. Monday morning I spent at\r\nSoissons, with two fine cathedrals, one in ruins, and an interesting\r\ntown, and then came on by night to Berne.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOYON.][395]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“The last night I was in London I dined with the Reptons to meet the\r\nKildares--Lady Kildare quite the most beautiful creature I ever saw.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOISSONS.][396]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 10._--Since I returned from Switzerland, my home life has been\r\nquite happy and uneventful. Only ten days ago I had a telegram from ‘my\r\nPrince’ (of Sweden and Norway), asking me to come and spend Sunday\r\nafternoon and evening with him at Eastbourne, as he was only there for\r\ntwo days. He met me most cordially and affectionately, making me feel as\r\nif the seeming neglect of several years was only ‘royalty’s way,’ and\r\npleasantly taking up all the dropped threads of life. We were several\r\nhours together, and while we were talking a sweet-faced young lady\r\nlooked in. ‘I must come in: you are such a friend of the Prince: I have\r\nheard of you, too, all my life. I am so very glad to see you at\r\nlast,’--and I felt at once that the Crown-Princess was a friend.\r\n\r\n“She wanted to know what I thought of the Prince--the Prince wanted to\r\nknow what I thought of her: I was glad to be able to answer both most\r\nsatisfactorily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHÂTEAU DE COUCY.][397]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“I saw her again at dinner, and she talked most delightfully, and was\r\nfull of animation and interest.

Two beautiful young girls\r\nwere tied together, and were going to be drowned. Suddenly a poissarde,\r\nseized with compassion from their looks, jumped upon a barrel and\r\nshouted, ‘Are there no young men here who will save the lives of these\r\ntwo beautiful girls by marrying them?’ Longworth and another young\r\nfellow were looking out of a window at the time and heard it, and said\r\nto one another, ‘Shall we do it?’ It was rather a gulp, for they were\r\nboth very young at the time; but they went down and said they would, and\r\nthey were both married there and then, by joining hands after the\r\nfashion of the Commune. The daughter of one of those marriages was\r\nThérèse Longworth.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEarly in October I paid a visit to my distant cousins, Mrs. Quin and her\r\nbrother, Edmund Boyle, who were staying at Ramsgate.

It is a charming\r\nhouse, full of books and pictures, in a beautiful country, with fine\r\nviews of Windsor and Claremont. Once there was an old priory here, but\r\nonly the fishponds are left. We went to-day to see the tomb of Pamela,\r\nmother of my Uncle Fitzgerald, at Thames Ditton. It was brought there\r\nfrom Montmartre, where it was broken by a bomb in 1870. It is inscribed,\r\n‘Pamela, Ladye Edward Fitzgerald, par son ami dévoué, L. L.;’ and no one\r\nnow knows who L. L. was. Close by are the graves of her daughter, Lady\r\nCampbell, and several of her grand-daughters.\r\n\r\n“The Foleys are said to descend from ‘Foley the Fiddler,’ a mechanic who\r\ndetermined to make his fortune by finding out the secret of making nails\r\nby machinery in Sweden. Up to that time the secret had been successfully\r\nkept: the ironfounders had shut every one out, and let no one see their\r\nprocess. But Foley the Fiddler, pretending to be half-witted, went and\r\nplayed in the neighbourhood of the manufactory. The Swedish workmen\r\ndanced to his music, and eventually were so delighted with him that they\r\ncould not resist taking him to play inside the factory. When he had been\r\nthere some time, he fancied he had seen all he wanted, and went home. He\r\nset up ironworks on the plan of what he had seen, but when he came to\r\ncompleting them, found that, after all, he did not understand the\r\nprocess perfectly. He went back, and the Swedish workmen were quite\r\ndelighted to find him again fiddling outside the factory--‘a daft\r\nfiddler’--and they brought him in, and he learnt all he wanted, and went\r\nhome and made a great fortune.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_“Goldings, Herts, Nov. 20._--Isabel Smith says that a lady in Wales, a\r\nfriend of Miss Frances Wynne, looked up suddenly one day after reading\r\nthe obituary in the _Times_, and exclaimed, ‘Now, at last, my lips are\r\nunsealed.’ Then she told this:--\r\n\r\n“One day she had been alone at her country-house in Wales, with her son\r\nand a friend of his. She had received all the money for her rents that\r\nday--a very large sum--and put it away in a strong box. Being asked, she\r\nsaid she did not mind the least having it in her room, and should sleep\r\nwith the key under her pillow.\r\n\r\n“When she had been in bed some time, she was aware that her door opened,\r\nand that a man in a cloak came into her room with a candle. He passed\r\nthe candle before her face, but she lay with closed eyes, perfectly\r\nmotionless. Then he felt for the key; he felt for a long time, but\r\nsomehow he failed to find it. At last he went away.\r\n\r\n“As soon as the door closed, she sprang out of bed, intending to go to\r\nher son’s room to warn him that a robber was in the house. But his room\r\nwas a long way off, and she thought it would be better to go instead to\r\nthe friend, whose room was nearer.\r\n\r\n“As she opened the door suddenly, she saw a figure muffled up in a long\r\ncloak put down the candle. It was the same figure who had come into her\r\nroom. She looked at him fixedly. ‘To-morrow at 9 A.M.,’ she said, ‘the\r\ndogcart will come to the door which was to have taken my strong box to\r\nthe bank: you will go in that dogcart, and you will never enter my door\r\nagain. If you never attempt to do this, I will never say a word on what\r\nhas happened as long as you live.’ And she never did, even to her son.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 21._--We have spent the day at Knebworth, an interesting place,\r\nthough full of shams--a sham old house, with a sham lake, sham heraldic\r\nmonsters, sham ancient portraits, &c. Lord Lytton, with his velvet\r\ncollar and gold chains, recalled his father, who is represented on the\r\nwalls, with his boots pointed like a needle, in a picture by Maclise.\r\nThe ‘old’ rooms are chiefly modern in reality, but there is one really\r\nancient bedroom--a room in which Queen Elizabeth once slept. Lady\r\nLytton, beautiful, charming, and courteous, looked like a queen in the\r\nlarge saloons and galleries. We found Lady Marian Alford, Lady\r\nColley--the pretty widow of Sir George--and Lady Paget, with her nice\r\nson Victor, amongst the guests.\r\n\r\n“I wish one did not know that the real name of the Lyttons is Wiggett.\r\nWilliam Wiggett took the name of Bulwer on his marriage with Sarah\r\nBulwer in 1756, and his youngest son (the novelist) took the name of\r\nLytton on succeeding to his mother’s property of Knebworth, she being\r\none Elizabeth Warburton, whose very slight connection with the real\r\nLytton family consisted in the fact that her grandfather, John Robinson\r\nwas cousin (maternally) to Lytton Strode, who was great-nephew of a Sir\r\nWilliam Lytton, who died childless in 1704.\r\n\r\n“I have had the small trial of another ‘call’ of £300 on those\r\nunfortunate Electric Lights in which St. George Lane Fox involved me. I\r\nhad saved up the money, so it was there, but it was provoking to have to\r\npay what is almost certain to be lost, yet to be obliged to do so, as\r\nthe only chance of seeing again any part of the £7000 which had gone\r\nbefore it. However, I am never more than very temporarily troubled by\r\nsuch things--there is no use. All I have ever made by my writings in\r\nfourteen very hard-worked years is gone now through St. G.

I arrived with Lord and Lady Leitrim--he quite charming, so\r\nmerry, pleasant, and natural, and she one of the delightful sisters of\r\ncharming Lady Powerscourt. It has been a great pleasure to find the\r\nBoynes here, and Lady Newark, who is an absolute sunbeam in her\r\nhusband’s home--perfect in her relation to every member of his family. I\r\nhave been again to Welbeck and Clumber, only remarking fresh at the\r\nformer a fine Sir Joshua of a Mr. Cleaver, an old man in the\r\nneighbourhood, dressed in grey, and the melancholy interesting portrait\r\nof Napoleon by Delaroche, given by the Duc de Coigny.\r\n\r\n“A Mrs. Francklin (sister of Lord St. Vincent), staying here, says that\r\na young man, going to stay with Millais, saw distinctly a hand and arm\r\ncome out of the fireplace in his room, and do it repeatedly.

No one knew so much\r\nabout the Empress as Merimée. He had known her well as a girl, and all\r\nthe letters about the marriage had passed through his hands. Nothing\r\ncould be more naïve than the Empress in her early married days. She\r\n_would_ go shopping. She clapped her hands with delight at the\r\nopera-bouffe, and the Emperor took them and held them, to the great\r\ndelight of the people, who applauded vehemently.\r\n\r\n“In the last days at the Tuileries, all the court ladies were only\r\noccupied in packing up their own things; all deserted their mistress\r\nexcept Madame le Breton. She and the Empress stayed to the last. The\r\nEmpress asked General Tronchin how long the palace could hold out. He\r\nsaid, ‘Certainly three days.’ It did not hold out three hours. They fled\r\nas the people entered, fled precipitately by the long galleries of the\r\nLouvre, once in agony finding a door locked and having to look for the\r\nkey. The Empress had no bonnet. Madame le Breton, with a bit of lace,\r\nmade something for her head. They reached the street and hailed a cab.\r\n‘Eh! ma petite mère,’ said the driver, ‘il parait que nous nous sauvons:\r\noù est le papa donc?’ But he took them and did not recognise them. They\r\nwent in the cab to the Boulevard Haussmann. Then they found that they\r\nhad no money to pay it, and Madame le Breton took off one of her rings.\r\n‘We have forgotten our money,’ she said, ‘but you see how suffering my\r\nfriend is. I _must_ take her on to the dentist, but I will leave this\r\nwith you; give me your address and I will redeem it.’ And he let them\r\ngo.\r\n\r\n“They took a second cab to the house of Evans, the American dentist, and\r\nthere found he was gone to his villa at Passy. They followed him there,\r\nbut when they reached the villa, the servant said he was out, and\r\npositively refused to let them in. But Madame le Breton insisted--her\r\nfriend was so terribly ill: Mr. Evans knew her very well: she was quite\r\ncertain that he would see her: and at length she almost forced her way\r\nin, and, moreover, made the servant pay the cab. At last Mr. Evans came\r\nin. He had been to Paris, in terrible anxiety as to the fate of the\r\nEmpress, knowing that the mob had broken into the Tuileries.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Baring said that when Plonplon, commonly called ‘_Fatalité_,’ was\r\nill, the people said he was ‘_Fat alité_.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Hickledon, Dec. 17._--No words can say how glad I am to be here with\r\nthe dearest friend of my young life--dearer still, if possible, with\r\nall his six children around him, who are learning also to be fond of me.\r\nWe walk and talk, and are perfectly happy together in everything.\r\n\r\n“We have been to visit Barnborough Church. A man met a wild-cat in Bella\r\nWood, some distance off. He and the cat fought all the way along the\r\nhillside, and they both fell down dead in this church porch.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday we went to Sprotborough to visit old Miss Copley. It is a\r\nvery pretty place, a handsome house on a terrace upon a wooded bank\r\nabove the river. Sir Joseph Copley and his wife Lady Charlotte (Pelham)\r\nquarrelled early in their married life. He overheard her at Naples,\r\nthrough a thin wall of a room, telling a friend that he was mad, and he\r\nnever forgave it. They were separated for some years, then they lived\r\ntogether again, but there was no cordiality. They were really Moyles. A\r\nMoyle married a Copley heiress, and the Copleys long ago had married the\r\nheiress of the Fitzwilliams, for Sprotborough was the old Fitzwilliam\r\nplace, and many of the family are buried there in the church. The\r\nCopleys divided into two branches, of Sprotborough and Wadsworth, and it\r\nis a pretty story that when the Copley of Sprotborough had nothing but\r\ndaughters, he left the estate to the Copley of Wadsworth, and then, when\r\nthe Copley of Wadsworth had nothing but daughters, he left it back to\r\nthe representative of the other branch. Not far from Sprotborough,\r\nConisborough stands beautifully on the top of a wooded hill: in\r\n‘Ivanhoe’ its castle is the place where Athelstan lies in state when\r\nsupposed to be dead.\r\n\r\n“The Bishop of Winchester told Charlie Wood that his predecessor, Bishop\r\nWilberforce, had always very much wished to see a portrait at Wotton\r\n(the Evelyns’ place) of Mrs. Godolphin, whose life he had written whilst\r\nhe was at Alverstoke. This wish he had often expressed; but Mr. Evelyn\r\nhad not liked the Bishop, and he had never been invited.\r\n\r\n“On the day on which the Bishop set off with Lord Granville to ride to\r\n‘Freddie Leveson’s,’ Mr. Evelyn, his brother, and a doctor were sitting\r\nlate in the dining-room at Wotton, when the brother exclaimed, ‘Why,\r\nthere is the Bishop of Winchester looking in at the window.’ They all\r\nthree then saw him distinctly. Then he seemed to go away towards some\r\nshrubs, and they thought he must have gone round to the door, and\r\nexpected him to be announced. But he never came, and an hour after a\r\nservant brought in the news that he had been killed only two miles off.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. George Portal of Burgclere told Charlie Wood that when Allan\r\nHerbert was so ill at Highclere--ill to death, it was supposed--the\r\nnurse, who was sitting up, saw an old lady come into the room when he\r\nwas at the worst, gaze at him from the foot of the bed, and nod her head\r\nrepeatedly. When he was better, and after he could be left, the\r\nhousekeeper, wishing to give the nurse a little distraction, showed her\r\nthrough the rooms, and, in Lord Carnarvon’s sitting-room, the nurse\r\nsuddenly pointed at the portrait over the chimney-piece and said, ‘That\r\nis the lady who came into the sick-room.’ The portrait was that of old\r\nLady Carnarvon, Allan Herbert’s mother, and the servants well\r\nrecollected her peculiar way of nodding her head repeatedly.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. George Portal was niece of Lady Anne Townshend, who was also aunt\r\nof that young Lord George Osborne who was killed at Oxford when\r\nwrestling with Lord Downshire in 1831. On the day of his death, she saw\r\nhim pass through the room; she called to him, and he did not answer; she\r\nrang the bell for the servant, who declared he had never entered the\r\nhouse, and then she wrote the fact of having seen him to her husband,\r\nwho was absent. Next morning came a messenger to tell Lady Anne of the\r\ndeath of her nephew, with whom she had been very intimate, and to beg\r\nher to break it to her sister--his mother, the Duchess of Leeds. Years\r\nafter, when Mrs. George Portal was sorting her aunt’s letters after her\r\ndeath, she found amongst them the very letter to her husband in which\r\nshe told what she had seen.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Mount St. John, Dec. 20._--To-day was Lord Halifax’s birthday. The\r\nhounds met at Hickledon, wishing to do him honour, but it was almost too\r\nmuch for him. With me, I think it has been a pleasure to him to go back\r\ninto old days, old memories, old sketch-books, &c. I cannot say how much\r\nI enjoyed my visit to the kind old man, as well as to my own dear\r\nCharlie--better, dearer, more charming than ever, and more in favour,\r\none feels sure, with God as well as with man.\r\n\r\n“Yet Charlie does not wish to die: his life here is so perfectly happy\r\nand useful, but he says that it must be ‘very unpleasant to God to feel\r\nthat His children never wish to come home: he is sure _he_ should feel\r\nit so with his children.’ He says he is quite certain what the pains of\r\nPurgatory will be--‘they will be the realising for the first time the\r\nlove of God, and not being able to do anything for Him: this life is our\r\nonly chance.’ He says he is ‘sure that the next life will be in a more\r\nbeautiful world, like this, only glorified, and so much, oh! so much\r\nbetter in everything. “Such cats!” my Uncle Courtenay says, “_such_\r\ncats!”’\r\n\r\n“Young Charlie came home yesterday, a most delightful boy, only less\r\nengaging perhaps than little Francis.[398] To me, these children of my\r\ndear brother-like friend are what no other children can ever be.\r\n\r\n“This Mount St. John (where I am now visiting Mrs. J. Dundas, Charlie\r\nWood’s sister) is a beautiful place, very high up in hills which are now\r\nsnowy. There is a long chain of them, ending in Rolleston Scaur, where\r\nit is said that, in the earliest times of Christianity, the followers of\r\nthe Druids met the first missionaries in a public discussion. The devil\r\nwas disguised in the ranks of the former, who, for a long time, had the\r\nbest of it; but, when Christian truth began to prevail, he was so\r\ndisgusted that he flew away to the neighbouring isolated height of\r\nHode’s Point, and a stone which stuck to his red-hot foot was deposited\r\non its summit--a tangible proof of the story, as it is of a wholly\r\ndifferent geological formation from its surroundings. The view from\r\nthese hills is intensely beautiful, comprising York Minster in the hazy\r\nplain, and the many places which take their name from the god\r\nThor--Thirkleby, Thirsk, &c.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 24._--Yesterday we spent at Newburgh, cordially received, and\r\nshown all over the house by Lady Julia Wombwell--a most simple,\r\npleasant, winning person. There is the look of an old Dutch house\r\nexternally, in the clock-tower, clipped yews, and formal water. Inside,\r\nthe house is very uncomfortable and cold, and has no good staircase.\r\nMary, Lady Falconberg, Cromwell’s daughter, is said to have rescued her\r\nfather’s body from Westminster at the Restoration, and to have buried it\r\nhere at the top of the stairs leading to the maids’ rooms. The family,\r\nhowever, prudently refuse to open ‘the tomb’ and see if there is\r\nanything inside. Two portraits are shown as those of Mary, Lady\r\nFalconberg, and there really is an old silver pen which belonged to her\r\nfather. There is a beautiful Vandyke of a Bellasye in a red coat, and a\r\ngood Romney of a lady. The church has an octagonal tower and some tombs\r\nof Falconbergs. At the end of the village is the house of Sterne, who\r\nwas curate there, with an inscription.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Whitburn, Dec. 28._--Lizzie Williamson[399] says she wonders very much\r\nthat, when our Saviour was on earth, no one thought of asking Him if\r\npeople ill of hopeless and agonising complaints, idiots, cretins, &c.,\r\nmight not be put out of the way--‘the Bible would have been so much more\r\nuseful if it had only given us a little information on these points.’\r\n\r\n“I stayed a few hours in Durham as I passed through, and found what is\r\nso picturesque in summer unbearably black and dismal in winter. The\r\npresent Dean (Lake), who has so spoilt the cathedral, is most unpopular.\r\nOne day he had taken upon himself to lecture Mr. Greenwell, one of the\r\nminor canons, for doing his part in the service in thick laced boots.\r\nGreenwell was furious. Rushing out of the cathedral, he met Archdeacon\r\nBland, the most polite and deliberate of men, and exclaimed, ‘I’ve been\r\nhaving the most odious time with the Dean, and I really think he must\r\nhave got the devil in him.’--‘No, Mr. Greenwell, no, no, not that,’ said\r\nArchdeacon Bland in his quiet way; ‘he is only possessed by three imps:\r\nhe is imperious, he is impetuous, and he is impertinent.’\r\n\r\n“People are full of ‘The Unclassed,’ a powerful novel, though, as a very\r\npretty young lady said to me the other day, ‘not at all the sort of book\r\none would give to one’s mother to read!’\r\n\r\n“Coming through Roker, I heard a woman say, ‘Wal, geese is geese, and ye\r\ncanna mak um nought else.’ But some one else had this to report as a\r\nspecimen Northumbrian sentence: ‘I left the door on the sneck, and, as I\r\nwas ganging doun the sandy chare (lane), I met twa bairnies huggin a can\r\no’ bumblekites, and a good few tykes were havin a reglar hubbledeshoo o’\r\na midden.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Brancepeth Castle, Jan. 3, 1885._--Mr. Wharton dined. He said, ‘When I\r\nwas at the little inn at Ayscliffe, I met a Mr. Bond, who told me a\r\nstory about my friend Johnnie Greenwood of Swancliffe. Johnnie had to\r\nride one night through a wood a mile long to the place he was going to.\r\nAt the entrance of the wood a large black dog joined him, and pattered\r\nalong by his side. He could not make out where it came from, but it\r\nnever left him, and when the wood grew so dark that he could not see it,\r\nhe still heard it pattering beside him. When he emerged from the wood,\r\nthe dog had disappeared, and he could not tell where it had gone to.\r\nWell, Johnnie paid his visit, and set out to return the same way. At the\r\nentrance of the wood, the dog joined him, and pattered along beside him\r\nas before; but it never touched him, and he never spoke to it, and\r\nagain, as he emerged from the wood, it ceased to be there.\r\n\r\n“‘Years after, two condemned prisoners in York gaol told the chaplain\r\nthat they had intended to rob and murder Johnnie that night in the wood,\r\nbut that he had a large dog with him, and when they saw that, they felt\r\nthat Johnnie and the dog together would be too much for them.’\r\n\r\n“‘Now that is what I call a useful ghostly apparition,’ said Mr.\r\nWharton.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_London, Feb. 22, 1885._--At dinner at Miss Bromley’s I met the Misses\r\nBryant, who live in 17 Somerset Street. On the ground-floor of the house\r\nis a large room said to be haunted, and in which such terrible noises\r\nare heard as prevent any one sleeping there. A man with a grey beard\r\nonce committed suicide in that room. The other day some children,\r\nnephews and nieces of the Misses Bryant, came to spend the afternoon\r\nwith them, and, to amuse them, one of the ladies got them to help her in\r\narranging her garden upon the leads. While they were at work, the little\r\nboy looked over the parapet into the court below, and said, ‘Who is that\r\nold man with the grey beard who keeps looking at me out of that window?\r\nOh! he is gone now, but he has put out his head and looked up at me\r\nseveral times.’ The window was that of ‘Greybeard’s room.’ Miss Bryant\r\nimmediately ran down and asked the servants if any one with a grey beard\r\nhad come into the house, but no one had entered the house at all, and\r\n‘Greybeard’s room’ was locked up.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 7._--Two days ago I dined with Lady Sarah Lindsay to meet\r\nColonel Hugh Lindsay and Lady Jane. Colonel Lindsay was full of\r\nspiritualism and the wonderful discoveries this generation seems on the\r\nverge of. He had himself seen a large table, which had been first set in\r\nmotion, after the hands which touched it were taken away, float up to\r\nthe ceiling, remain there for some time over their heads, and then float\r\ndown again. ‘The conjurors Maskelyne and Cook could not have done this;\r\nthey might have raised the table (by wires), but it would not have\r\nfloated.’\r\n\r\n“Colonel Lindsay spoke much of the wonderful Providence which keeps down\r\nvoracious animals. He said that the aphis (of the rose, &c.) reproduced\r\nitself in such intense multitudes, that, if not kept down by weather\r\nand other insects, it would, _in ten days_, have assumed proportions\r\nequal in volume to many thousand times the inhabitants of the earth, the\r\nwhole air would be darkened, and every living thing upon earth would be\r\nutterly consumed by them!\r\n\r\n“Lady Sarah told of her grandmother, old Lady Hardwicke,[400] with whom\r\na young lady came to stay. They dined at three o’clock, but when the\r\ngirl came down, she was dreadfully agitated, and looked as if she had\r\nseen a ghost. When Lady Hardwicke pressed her as to the reason, she,\r\nafter a time, confessed that it was because there was a spirit in her\r\nroom. It came to her lamenting its hard fate whilst she was dressing,\r\nand she was sure there had been a murder in that room. Lady Hardwicke\r\nsaid, ‘Well, my dear, to-morrow you must let me come and stay with you\r\nwhen you are dressing,’ and she did. Soon the girl said, ‘There--there\r\nit is!’ and Lady Hardwicke really did hear something. ‘Oh, listen!’\r\ncried the girl. ‘Once I was hap-hap-hap-y, but now I am me-e-e-serable!’\r\na voice seemed to wail: it was the old kitchen jack!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 19._--Edward Malet was married to Lady Ermyntrude Russell in\r\nWestminster Abbey at 4 P.M. Seldom was there a greater crowd in the\r\nstreets near Westminster. I met Lady Jane Repton in the crush, and we\r\nmade our way in together through the Deanery. The glorious building was\r\ncrowded from end to end, and the music most beautiful. Perhaps the\r\ngreatest of smaller features was Lady Ermyntrude’s dress, which the\r\npapers describe as ‘more pearly than pearl, and more snowy than snow.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 28._--Dining at Mrs. Quin’s, I met Mrs. Ward, who was very\r\namusing.\r\n\r\n“She described the airs of Frances-Anne, Lady Londonderry.[401] One day\r\nshe was extremely irritated with her page, and sent him to Lord\r\nLondonderry with a note, in which she had written in pencil, ‘Flog this\r\nfellow well for me: he has been quite unendurable.’ But the page read\r\nthe note on the way, and meeting one of the great magnificent flunkeys,\r\nsix feet high, said, ‘Just oblige me by taking this note in to my lord:\r\nI am forced to do something else.’ The flunkey brought out the answer,\r\nand met the page, who took it in to his lady. She was rather surprised,\r\nfor it was--‘I’m afraid.’ Mrs. Ward was in the house when this happened.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Ward recollected, in her own childhood, when she was not three\r\nyears old, sitting on the floor in her mother’s sitting-room cutting up\r\na newspaper with a pair of blunt scissors. A lady came in to see her\r\nmother, and brought with her two very fat children, with great round\r\nstaring eyes. The children were told to sit down by her on the floor,\r\nand she was bidden to amuse them. It was impossible: they only stared in\r\nhopeless irresponsiveness. Soon her mother began to talk as loudly as\r\nshe could. It was to drown the voice of her own little girl, whom she\r\nheard repeating aloud a verse of the psalm she had been learning that\r\nmorning, ‘Eyes have they, but they see not: ears have they, but they\r\nhear not: neither speak they with their lips.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHRINE OF ST. ERASMUS, WESTMINSTER ABBEY.][402]\r\n\r\n“In the afternoon I went with a crowd to see Herkomer’s portrait of my\r\nfriend Katharine Grant--a magnificent _tour de force_, white upon\r\nwhite.”\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of May 1885 I set off on the first of a series of excursions\r\nin France for literary purposes, oftentimes of dismal solitude, and\r\nalways of weary hard work, though full of interest of their own. I found\r\nthen, as I have always done, how different seeing a thing with intention\r\nis to ordinary sight-seeing. A dentist at Rome once said to me, “Mr.\r\nHare, you do not brush your teeth.”--“Yes, indeed I do,” I answered,\r\n“every night and morning.”--“Ah! yes; you brush them from habit, but not\r\nfrom motive;” and I discovered the result from my many past tours in\r\nFrance had been just the same. As usual, I found that the ordinary\r\nEnglish travellers, who are always occupied in playing at “follow my\r\nleader” all the time they are abroad, had missed the best part of\r\nFrance, and that the churches and abbeys of the Correze and\r\nCreuse--almost unknown hitherto--are absolutely glorious; and some\r\nplaces in that part of France--Rocamadour, for instance--worthy of being\r\ncompared with the very finest scenes in Italy. I described much of this\r\ntour in a series of papers in the _Art Journal_, as well as in my books\r\non France. In the central provinces the accommodation was very good in\r\nits way, and the food always excellent, but in some of the places in the\r\nEastern Pyrenees the dirt was scarcely endurable. The excellent hotel\r\nat Montpelier came as a real respite. Whilst there, I made some\r\nacquaintance with a banker of the place, who had a poetic Ruskin-like\r\nway of describing the wildness of the Cevennes, the grey rocks, desolate\r\nscenery, long lines of russet landscape. This so took hold of me, that I\r\nwent to Lodêve and engaged a carriage for several days to explore the\r\nCevennes thoroughly. It was wild enough certainly and rather curious,\r\nbut an unbroken monotone; every view, every rocky foreground, even each\r\ndreary ruinous village, repeated the last, and after eight or nine hours\r\nI was utterly wearied of it; thus it was an intense relief when my\r\ndriver came in the evening, with no end of apologies, and said he had\r\nreceived a telegram, bidding him return at once to Lodêve; and I was\r\nfree to jump into the first diligence and reach the nearest station.\r\nRailway then took me to Mende, an exceedingly beautiful place, and\r\nafterwards to Rodez. Hence I went south again by S. Antonin and\r\nBruniquel, whence beautiful recollections of the spring verdure and\r\nclear river come back to me. I made a little tour afterwards to Luchon\r\nand other places in the Pyrenees which I had not seen before, and\r\nreturned straight home from Bordeaux. During this two months’ tour I do\r\nnot think I ever once saw an English person, even in the railway, and I\r\nmade no acquaintances.\r\n\r\nI found Lourdes entirely changed since I was there last by its enormous\r\nreligious pilgrimages, and no doubt, whether from the healing waters or\r\nthe power of faith, many wonderful cures had taken place. It was\r\nstrange, on nearing the miraculous fountain, to read the inscription,\r\n“Ici les malades vont au pas,” &c. A story was told of an officer who\r\nhad a wooden leg and came to the fountain. When he put in his legs (he\r\nput them both in, the wooden leg and the other), as he did so he uttered\r\na little prayer--“Faites, Seigneur, O faites que mes jambes soient\r\npareilles.” When he drew them out, they were both wooden legs!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Châteauroux, May 6, 1885._--What weather! bitter north-east winds and\r\ntorrents of rain ever since I landed in France.... I spent Sunday at\r\nEtampes, a little narrow town, one street wide and three miles long,\r\nwith four churches of the utmost architectural importance.... Leaving\r\nOrleans, my ‘Untrodden France’ began, and very pleasantly, at pretty\r\nVierzon on the rushing river Cher. There are rather oppressive moments\r\nof solitude, but in this awful weather I am especially glad not to have\r\nany grumblers against disagreeables which cannot be helped.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Argenton, May 8._--Yesterday I was called at five for an excursion of\r\nforty miles up the valley of the Creuse, but it rained in such torrents\r\nit was impossible. At eight it cleared a little, and I set off, and\r\n_did_ it all, returning at eight, but it rained in a deluge more than\r\nhalf the time. There were, however, beautiful moments of sun-gleam, and\r\nthe scenery very lovely. At Le Crozant, the great rendezvous of French\r\nartists, where a most charming old woman keeps a very primitive inn, it\r\nis even magnificent, finer than anything on Rhine or Moselle--stupendous\r\nrocks and a grand castle. Gargilesse, the place where Mme. George Sand\r\nlived so oddly, and wrote ‘Promenades autour de mon Village,’ is also a\r\nvery curious and charming place, the village clustering around a\r\nromanesque church in the _enceinte_ of a great ruined castle above the\r\nriver.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Brive, May 15._--I feel like a child eating through a cake, feeling it\r\na duty not to leave anything remarkable unseen in this part of France,\r\nso little known to the English. How unfairly those judge this country\r\nwho measure France by what they see from the well-known railways to\r\nStrasbourg or Marseilles. Nothing can be more beautiful than these hills\r\nand valleys of the Creuse and Correze, nothing more rich than the\r\nforest-clad country, besides the interest of endless castles and later\r\nchâteaux, of old towns where the greater proportion of the houses date\r\nfrom the thirteenth century, and of perfectly honest, primitive, and\r\nunspoilt people.\r\n\r\n“I came to Limoges last Friday, and remained there five days, that is to\r\nsay, was scarcely there at all, but returned to a good hotel there at\r\nnight. I saw the great castle of Chalusset; the romanesque Abbey of\r\nSolignac; S. Junien, a most grand church; Le Dorat, almost as fine;\r\nMontmorillon, full of curiosities; and Chalus, where Richard Cœur de\r\nLion was killed, and where, under the old castle he was besieging, the\r\nstone called Rocher de Malmont still rises in the water-meadows, upon\r\nwhich he was standing when the fatal arrow struck him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LE CROZANT.][403]\r\n\r\n“Then I came here, and am staying here in the same way, breakfasting\r\ndaily at seven, off at half-past seven, and only returning to go to\r\nbed. All yesterday I was at the wonderful sanctuary of Rocamadour--the\r\nLa Salette of these parts--a most curious place, beautiful exceedingly;\r\nindeed, though it sounds a very grand comparison, rather like--Tivoli!\r\nBut it poured all day, with a bitter wind, and this has been the case\r\nevery day, only this afternoon there have been lovely lights at the\r\nfalls of Gimel in the exquisite mountain forests. I am so glad I have no\r\ncompanions: they would never have endured the discomfort. No words can\r\nsay how tired I am every day, nor how wet, nor how dirty; but I shall be\r\nglad afterwards to have done it all.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOLIGNAC.][404]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROCAMADOUR.][405]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sarlat in the Dordogne, May 21._--We are still in swelching torrents\r\n... but this is a pleasant little hotel in an old cathedral town, with\r\nmarvellous streets of houses of fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth\r\ncenturies. The weather makes no end of hindrances and discomforts, yet\r\nin this tour, as in all others, I have found that expected misfortunes\r\nnever happen: there are plenty of others, but what one looks for never\r\ncomes, and I have gone on steadily, missing nothing of the plan marked\r\nout, only sometimes delayed. The people are beyond measure pleasant and\r\nkind, and the cheapness of everything is a perpetual amazement.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Carcassonne, May 28._--On Friday 23rd it poured in torrents, but I\r\ncould not give in, so went by the earliest train as far into the hills\r\nas it penetrated, and then by omnibus to Souillac, one of the grand and\r\nglorious abbey churches, now parochial, which are so common in that part\r\nof France and nowhere else--full of colour and solemnity, though rugged\r\nto a degree, and into which you descend by long flights of steps.\r\n\r\n“It poured in returning too, but I stopped at a wayside station, and a\r\nlong walk through chalky mud and a ferry over the Dordogne took me to\r\nFénelon, which is a noble old château splendidly placed on a peninsula\r\nlooking down upon the meeting of many valleys and streams. It has always\r\nbeen kept up; its terraces were in luxuriant beauty of flowers, and the\r\nowner, Comte de Morville, was excessively civil in showing everything. I\r\ndrew under an umbrella in torrents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLOISTER OF CADOUIN.][406]\r\n\r\n“Saturday I was up at five, and off by rail and road to Cadouin, another\r\nof those grand abbey churches, of the same character as the rest, but\r\nwith the addition of a splendid gothic cloister. I arrived at nine,\r\nperished with wet and cold, but was resuscitated by the kind woman at\r\nthe little inn, who made a hot fire on the great dogs of her hearth, and\r\nsoon had hot coffee ready. It was, however, a long day, and I did not\r\narrive till near midnight at Montpazier. This curious Bastide was built\r\nby Edward III. of England, and has never been touched since his time,\r\nand, whilst all is so changed in England, it was interesting to find in\r\nthis remote French hill-country a town the same as when the Black Prince\r\nlived there, with old walls and gates, gothic house-windows, rectangular\r\nstreets, and in the centre of all the market, surrounded by arcades\r\nlike those at Padua, only here the arcades are so wide that you can\r\ndrive _in_ them. It was a quaint, charming place, and I stayed till\r\nMonday, spending Sunday in the magnificent old Château de Biron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARCADES OF MONTPAZIER.][407]\r\n\r\n“Then, by Cahors, with its wonderful old bridge over the Lot, I came to\r\nMontpezat, a very simple place and primitive inn--wild open down, old\r\nchurch, arcaded streets, flowers, goats, and old women in white-winged\r\ncaps. Late that night I reached Moissac, a place where there is a\r\nwonderful church and cloister, which has been extolled as one of the\r\narchaeological marvels of the world, but its describers have evidently\r\nnever seen St. Junien, Le Dorat, Souillac, Cadouin.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Narbonne, June 4._--The wet weather has changed to intense heat.\r\nSaturday was an interesting day at Alet, a ruined cathedral, and pretty\r\ndesolate place on the edge of the Eastern Pyrenees, with a very\r\nadmirable old curé, with whom I made great friends. That afternoon\r\nbrought me to Perpignan, an almost Spanish town on the\r\nfrontier--filthily dirty, but I was obliged to stay there to see Prades,\r\nthe fine lonely monastery of S. Michel de Cuxa, Amélie les Bains, and\r\nArles-sur-Tech. The great excursion to the latter place was indeed a\r\npenance--ten hours in a jolting diligence, five each way, with burning\r\nsun and stifling dust, and four passengers forced into each place meant\r\nfor three, so that _any_ movement was impossible, and as the diligence\r\nstarted at five, one was breakfastless. However, all miseries have an\r\nend, and Aries had to be visited, for St. Abdon and St. Sennen are\r\nburied there; but oh! how glad I was I had no companion to suffer too!\r\nOn the way here I saw Elne, most Spanish and picturesque, with perhaps\r\nthe most beautiful cloister in the world. Yesterday too was an\r\ninteresting day, spent entirely at the great convent of Fontefroide, in\r\nthe mountains nine miles from hence, spared at the late suppression of\r\nmonasteries on account of the beneficent and useful lives of its\r\nmonks--of whom there are still more than fifty--the benefactors of the\r\nwhole of this part of the country, not only in teaching and preaching,\r\nbut by taking the lead in all industrial and agricultural work. They\r\nreceive all strangers, and gave me an excellent luncheon, though, being\r\nWednesday, they had only boiled beans for themselves. The mountains all\r\nround the monastery were ablaze with cistus--white, pink, and\r\nrose-coloured, with yellow salvia and honeysuckle in masses.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT FONTEFROIDE.][408]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Lodéve, June 8._--From Montpelier I went to Aigues-Mortes, the old\r\nsea-town where St. Louis embarked for the Crusades, little altered since\r\nhis time, unless, indeed, the mosquitoes are worse, for they are\r\nterrible.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Lexos, Aveyron, June 15._--From Rodez and its great cathedral, and\r\nMareillac in the heart of the vine country, I had an excursion of\r\ntranscendent beauty through the most exquisite mountain valleys and\r\nchestnut forests, by rocks and waterfalls, to Conques. I was taken there\r\nby a single line in Fergusson’s ‘Architecture’ comparing it with\r\nSouillac, which I had already seen, but found perhaps the most beautiful\r\nspot in France, and, in that desolation, a glorious romanesque abbey\r\nchurch, grand as a cathedral of the first rank, in which, owing to its\r\nlonely position, all the curious mediaeval treasures remain unspoilt.\r\nHere, and indeed everywhere, I found the greatest kindness from the\r\ncharming well-to-do peasantry. Every one seems well off: every one full\r\nof courtesy and goodness; and though all the men in blouses expect to be\r\ntreated as equals, they are indescribably pleasant.\r\n\r\n“Anything so cheap as ‘Untravelled France’ it is impossible to imagine.\r\nEven at Mende, where it is quite a good hotel, prices were: room--very\r\ngood, 1 fr., dinner 2 fr., breakfast 50 c., service 50 c., bougie never\r\nanything, and these are the usual prices.\r\n\r\n“Nothing can describe what the delicious, sweetness of the acacias has\r\nbeen, so abundant in all these town-villages, and now it is giving way\r\nto that of the limes.\r\n\r\n“This is a wooden inn of the humblest kind, close in the shadow of a\r\ngreat junction station, at which I am for convenience, but the\r\npleasantness of the people gives it a charm.

She stopped and told them that, as they could not keep\r\nthemselves, she wondered they could keep a dog. The eldest boy answered\r\nrather savagely, ‘Father bought it: father gave sixpence for the dog,\r\nand right well he did too, for the rats wos so many, they wos, they\r\nused to eat our toes at night, and the dog keeps them all off.’\r\n\r\n“The Maharajah of Johore asked me to his ball. When he goes out to\r\nluncheon or dinner he sends on his own cook to prepare for him, taking\r\nwith him, to kill on the spot, the chicken which his master is to eat.\r\nWhen the cook kills it he says a sort of little prayer--‘Dear little\r\nbrother, forgive me for the pain I am going to inflict upon you: it will\r\nonly be momentary, and it really cannot be helped.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Campsea Ashe, Suffolk, August 22._--On the way here I saw Ipswich, its\r\ngreat feature being ‘the Ancient House,’ adorned outside with\r\nrepresentations of the Seasons. Close to St. Peter’s Church is Wolsey’s\r\nGate, covered with ivy, which led to his college. This place, which the\r\nWilliam Lowthers have bought, in the flat corn-lands of Suffolk, has a\r\nfine old garden, with clipped yew hedges and long tanks like Wrest. It\r\nhas been a most pleasant visit. I heard some one say once, ‘Mrs. Lowther\r\nis a most extraordinary woman: she never will let the grass grow under\r\nany one of her children’s feet even for a single instant;’ but it has\r\nmade them all very agreeable, from the immense variety of occupations in\r\nwhich they are interested, and in which, consequently, they interest\r\nothers. James Lowther, who is at home now, is certainly one of the\r\npleasantest and best-informed young men of the day. He has just been\r\nvery amusing about answers in Board Schools, telling, amongst others, of\r\na child who was asked ‘If King Alfred had been alive now, what part\r\nwould he have taken in politics?’ and replied, ‘If King Alfred had been\r\nalive now, he would have been far too old to have taken part in politics\r\nat all!’\r\n\r\n“We had a pleasant picnic at Framlingham, a noble ruined castle, which,\r\nfor Suffolk, stands almost on a height, and went to Sanbourn, the\r\nluxurious home of the rich family of Heywood, and to Glemham, where Lady\r\nNorth, mother of Lord Guildford, lives in a fine old house, which\r\ncontains much good old furniture and china.\r\n\r\n“We spent a long interesting day at the noble old moated house of\r\nHelmingham, where Lady Tollemache apologised amusingly for only having\r\nnine of her sons at home to assist her in doing the honours! It is a\r\ndelightful place, with beautiful old gardens, and its inhabitants are\r\ndelightful too. Lord Tollemache especially brims with goodness to all\r\naround him. He was very amusing in urging Miss Lowther, when she had as\r\nmany sons as he has (!), to make their home pleasanter to them than any\r\nother place in the world, so that they should always prefer it to\r\neverything else. He showed us all his relics, especially his Anglo-Saxon\r\nMS. of the time of Alfred the Great, and several beautiful Bibles of the\r\ntime of Edward I. There is a pretty picture of Mary Tudor as a child.\r\nQueen Elizabeth was at Helmingham, and stood godmother to a baby there,\r\nwho lived to become Sir Lionel Tollemache: that baby is represented,\r\nwith its three little sisters, in a curious picture in the hall.\r\n\r\n“In the church is the tomb of Colonel Thomas Tollemache, who was\r\ndistinguished in the wars of Queen Anne’s time. The Duke of Marlborough\r\nordered him to attack Brest. There were reasons which made him very\r\ndoubtful of success, and he represented to the Duke that the only chance\r\nof it lay in a surprise: still the Duke ordered him to attempt it. Brest\r\nwas found thoroughly prepared, the hoped-for surprise was an utter\r\nfailure, and Tollemache fell in the attack. The French Government had\r\nbeen forewarned, and it was afterwards found that it had been forewarned\r\nby Marlborough! When the Duc d’Aumale came to Helmingham, he said that\r\nthe thing he was most anxious to see was the monument of this\r\nunfortunate officer, and that he had himself read, in the archives at\r\nBrest, the letter of the Duke of Marlborough warning the garrison of the\r\ncoming attack.\r\n\r\n“The last owner of Campsea Ashe, Mr. Shepherd, was the grandson of a\r\ngardener. The Mr. Shepherd who then owned Campsea adopted a nephew, a\r\nyoung Frere, grandfather of the well-known Sir Bartle. The nephew\r\ninvited his friends to Campsea, and, after the fashion of the time, they\r\nsat up drinking. Very late, young Frere rang the bell and ordered\r\nanother bottle of port. The butler, very cross, went up to his master’s\r\nroom and woke him, saying that Mr. Frere wanted some more port and that\r\nhe must have the key of the cellar. Old Mr. Shepherd, furious, gave the\r\nkey, but next morning sent for a lawyer and disinherited his nephew,\r\nand, no one else being handy, and having a gardener he liked who bore\r\nhis own name of Shepherd, he left him his fortune.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, August 23._--In returning from Campsea Ashe I spent some\r\nhours at Colchester, and saw its two abbeys and its castle--rather\r\ncurious than beautiful.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Drayton House, Northamptonshire, Sept. 20._--I have been spending\r\nseveral days in this most pleasant old house, which is full of charm and\r\ninterest--many-towered, with an entrance court, a deserted Georgian\r\nchapel, a grand hall full of fine pictures, a vaulted room dating from\r\nEdward III., cellars probably from Henry III., admirable buildings of\r\nElizabeth and James I.\r\n\r\n“The place belonged to the Greenes, who, with the Earl of Wiltshire, who\r\nmarried a daughter of the house, have grand tombs in the church. Then it\r\npassed to the Mordaunts, and was left by Lady Mary Mordaunt, the\r\ndivorced wife of the Duke of Norfolk, to her second husband, Sir John\r\nGermaine, whose second wife, Lady Betty, left it to Lord George\r\nSackville, from whom it descended to its present owner, sweet engaging\r\nMrs. Sackville, who inherited it from her uncle, the last Duke of\r\nDorset, and who has all the perfect simplicity of the truest\r\nhigh-breeding.\r\n\r\n“The gardens are full of terraces, staircases, fountains, pleached\r\nwalks, avenues, and leaden statues--beautiful exceedingly. There is a\r\ngallery of Mordaunt portraits in the house; in the old library at the\r\ntop are no end of treasures, and out of it opens the Duchess of\r\nNorfolk’s boudoir, with old Japanese ornaments. Through a plank missing\r\nin the floor of an upper gallery you can look into quite a large room\r\nwhich no one has ever entered. Its windows are darkened by the\r\novergrowth of the creepers outside, and the only object in it is a large\r\nbox like a portmanteau. The Sackvilles have always lived here, yet not\r\none of them has had the curiosity to descend into that room or to look\r\ninto that portmanteau!\r\n\r\n“I have been taken to see the curious old house of Lyveden--never\r\nfinished--one of the three strange semi-religious erections of the\r\nTresham of the Gunpowder Plot. This is supposed to be in honour of the\r\nVirgin, and is covered with the oddest devices, such as ‘the Seven Eyes\r\nof God,’ the money-bag of Judas, with the thirty pieces of silver round\r\nit, &c. The second of Tresham’s buildings is Rothwell townhall; the\r\nthird a lodge at Rushton in honour of the Trinity, in which everything,\r\ndown to the minutest ornament, is three-cornered.\r\n\r\n“Then we have been to Boughton, the Duke of Buccleuch’s great desolate\r\nhouse, which contains two cartoons attributed, without any cause, to\r\nRaffaelle. The house was built by the Duke of Montagu, who was\r\nambassador to Louis XIV., and the king lent him a French architect and\r\ngardener. He made it as like a French château as possible. Then he told\r\nhis friends that he must plant an avenue to drive to London by, and when\r\nthey remonstrated that an immense part of the way to London did not\r\nbelong to him, he said, ‘Well, at any rate I will have an avenue of the\r\nsame length,’ and he planted seventy-two miles of it in his park. These\r\ntrees, hemming in the view in all directions, make the place\r\nindescribably dull. Just outside the park is the pretty village of\r\nGeddington, with a fine old church and bridge, and a beautiful Eleanor\r\ncross with slender detached columns. We went on thence to tea at Warkton\r\nwith Mrs. Bridges, wife of the clergyman, a real patrician Venetian\r\nbeauty, who has set all Northamptonshire quarrelling as to whether the\r\nglorious colour of her hair can be real; but it is. Half of the church\r\nher husband serves is a mausoleum of the Dukes of Buccleuch, who have\r\nfour large and magnificent monuments in it.\r\n\r\n“The old Duchess of Buccleuch, a homely-looking person, was very fond of\r\njoining people who came to see the place and talking to them. One day\r\nshe walked by a visitor and said, ‘You know, all this belongs to the\r\nDuke of Buccleuch.’--‘And pray, whom did he marry?’--‘ME!’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Cromer, Sept. 22._--I came yesterday to stay with the Lockers, who\r\nhave lately taken the additional name of Lampson, with a fortune from\r\nher father, Sir Curtis Lampson. They are exceedingly happy together. ‘My\r\nwinsome marrow,’ Mr. Locker has just said to his wife, ‘you know I never\r\ncan go anywhere without you.’ In the evening, Mr. Locker was very\r\npleasant in describing Rogers and his stories. Apropos of the dictum\r\nthat the postscript of a well-told story is often its best feature, he\r\ntold of Rogers describing a duel between a Frenchman and an Englishman,\r\nwhich was to be fought in the dark. The Englishman was a very humane\r\nman, and when it came to his turn to fire, fired up the chimney, that he\r\nmight do his adversary no harm, but brought down the Frenchman, who had\r\ntaken refuge there. ‘But when I tell that story in Paris,’ added\r\nRogers, ‘it is the Englishman who is up the chimney.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROMER.]\r\n\r\n“He told of a Mr. Egerton who was with his regiment in Canada. Coming\r\ninto the messroom one morning, he seemed much depressed, and being asked\r\nthe reason, said he was troubled by an oddly vivid dream, in which he\r\nhad seen his own coffin on the deck of a vessel, and in the dream had\r\nbeen even able to read the plate upon the coffin, which bore his name\r\nand the date June 16. He was so full of it, that the Colonel, to humour\r\nhim, wrote down the circumstances and the date. This was in April.\r\nAfterwards he went to Upper Canada, where he was killed by Indians on\r\nthe 16th of June, and his coffin was brought down the river as he had\r\nseen it. Mr. Locker told this story to Lord Algernon St. Maur, who said,\r\n‘I can corroborate that story, for I was in the messroom when what you\r\ndescribe occurred.’\r\n\r\n“Mr. Locker described Dickens’s way of telling stories. He heard him\r\ntell that of Lincoln’s dream, and of his describing the oppressive\r\nfeeling he had, how he was ‘drifting, drifting, drifting,’ and how at\r\nthat moment the members of council came in and he said, ‘Now we must go\r\nto business.’ It was on leaving that council that he was shot, so no one\r\nheard the end of that dream, or whether there would seem to be any\r\nforewarning in it.\r\n\r\n“We have been to-day to Felbrigge, the fine old house of the Windhams,\r\nsold to a Norwich tradesman named Catton, whose daughters have adopted\r\nthe older family as if it were their own, and are quite worthy of the\r\nold pictures, MSS., &c., all left in the house, _nothing_ having been\r\ntaken away when the place was given up. ‘Mr. Windham comes every night\r\nto look after his favourite books in the library,’ said Miss Catton; ‘he\r\noften comes, and he goes straight to the shelves where they are: we hear\r\nhim moving the tables and chairs about: we never disturb him though, for\r\nwe intend to be ghosts ourselves some day, and to come about the old\r\nplace just as he does.’ In the hall there is a grand bust of the\r\nstatesman by Nollekens. Formerly it was on his monument in the church,\r\nbut after some years the family put a copy there, and moved the original\r\ninto the house. The church, however, still retains the most glorious\r\nbrasses. One is that of a lady in waiting who came over with Anne of\r\nBohemia, and whose daughter was herself invited to share the throne. But\r\nthe man she really married was one of the early owners of Felbrigge.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sept. 24._--We have been with the Dick Gurneys in their fleet\r\nwaggonette to Blickling, quite glorious, so perfect in colour, with an\r\nexquisite entrance, and a splendid herbaceous garden. In the church is\r\nthe tomb which Lady Lothian has erected to her husband,[410] a most\r\ngrand one, with the head of the reclining statue turned to one side, and\r\nthe long beard drifted over the pillow.\r\n\r\n“The innumerable Gurneys, Buxtons, and Hoares who populate Cromer come\r\nin and out of this house, as of each other’s, whenever they like,\r\nwithout ringing the bell.\r\n\r\n“Last night Mrs. R. Hoare dined here. She says the people here always\r\naddress their superiors in the third person, as in French. They always\r\nsay ‘I’m very much fatagued,’ for bothered. ‘Well, Mrs. Smith, are you\r\ngoing to take the blue dress or the brown?’ she said when keeping a\r\ncharity shop. ‘Why, ma’am, I’ve not fairly averdupoised,’ replied the\r\nwoman; and it is a common expression for balancing.\r\n\r\n“There are many remnants here in Cromer from Danish occupation. The\r\nghosts, as in Denmark, are always without heads. There is great faith in\r\nthe story of ‘Old Strop,’ a Danish dog who was washed ashore with the\r\nbodies of two Danish sailors, one of whom was buried at Overstrand and\r\nthe other at Cromer. Every night the dog, headless, is believed to run\r\nfrom one grave to the other, and fishermen will always go round by the\r\nshore at night rather than by the shorter lane, which the dog is\r\nsupposed to take.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sept. 25._--Mrs. Ritchie (Miss Thackeray) is here, most charming and\r\ninteresting, as I have always thought her. She describes Tennyson and\r\nMrs. Kemble as the noblest man and woman she knows.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Kemble found, when in England, that her husband was going to take\r\nadvantage of an American law which allowed him to obtain a divorce if\r\nshe was away from him two years. For her children’s sake it was\r\nimperative that she should prevent this. She hurried back, and just\r\narrived in time by two or three days. Afterwards she herself quietly\r\nobtained a divorce in some way which gave her the charge of her\r\nchildren.... One of her daughters is Mrs. Leigh, whose husband, the\r\nVicar of St. Mary, Bryanston Square, she is always trying to persuade to\r\ngo out to the family plantations in Georgia. The other, Sarah, is the\r\nwife of a merchant in New York, and a replica--a much feebler\r\nreplica--of her mother.\r\n\r\n“Now, Mrs. Kemble is generally to be found knitting by her fireside. One\r\nday Mrs. Ritchie took her little girl to see her. ‘Here I am,’ Mrs.\r\nKemble said to the child, ‘an old woman who never allows another person\r\nto put in a word when she is talking; and now, what do you think of me?’\r\nThe little girl, who was shy, did not know what to say, and looked as if\r\nshe was going to cry. Mrs. Ritchie, to fill up the gap, said, ‘Oh, she\r\nthinks, Mrs. Kemble, that no one could possibly wish to put in a word\r\nwhen they could listen to you.’ ‘Ma fille, ne dites pas des choses\r\ncomme ça,’ cried Mrs. Kemble furiously; and then, more quietly, ‘You\r\nshould not say such things before the child: it is not right to teach\r\nher to be artificial.’\r\n\r\n“‘Right is right,’ she said one day, ‘and wrong is wrong, but God forbid\r\nthat I should judge of another whether he is right or wrong.’\r\n\r\n“‘One day,’ said Mrs. Ritchie, ‘I found Mrs. Kemble sitting by her\r\nfireside looking rather disconsolate, and asked her what she was doing.\r\n“Oh, I’m knocking my head against the wall, my dear; that man who was\r\nhere was so dreadfully stupid, I’m obliged to knock it out of me.”’\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Kemble was at an inn in Switzerland with a lady with whom she\r\nnever made acquaintance. They were both reading ‘Middlemarch,’ and came\r\ndown with their books into the public room, and were engrossed in them.\r\nBut one day the lady was so enchanted with a passage in her volume that\r\nshe burst out with, ‘Well, this woman is one of the noblest of authors:\r\nwhatever the peculiarities of her views on life may be, I will never\r\nbelieve that the woman who can write thus can be other than one with the\r\nvery noblest aims.’ Then Mrs. Kemble turned upon her furiously with,\r\n‘Who are _you_ that you should presume to _dare_ to judge such a woman\r\nas George Eliot? how can you _dare_ to judge her?’ and the lady jumped\r\nup, and, instead of being angry, embraced Mrs. Kemble upon the spot.\r\n\r\n“For her own sharp sayings, Mrs. Kemble is repaid by her grandchildren.\r\nShe wrote to one of her grandsons that she did not care for Wagner’s\r\nmusic, she could not understand what he meant by it. He answered, that\r\na fly crawling up the wall of Cologne Cathedral might as well presume to\r\njudge of its architectural glories as she of Wagner! She did not seem to\r\nknow whether to be angry or pleased at this.\r\n\r\n“Dear Lady Marian Alford used to tell of her first meeting Mrs. Kemble\r\nat a garden-party. She had scarcely sat down by her when Mrs. Kemble\r\nsaid slowly, with her peculiar intonation and inflection upon each\r\nsyllable--‘I do per-ceive a ... stink!’\r\n\r\n“Being asked if she would employ Pakenham or M’Crackem as agent for\r\nsending her goods from Italy to England, Mrs. Kemble said, ‘Why, rather\r\nPack’em than Crack’em, to be sure.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sept. 30._--A charming visit to the Delawarrs at Buckhurst. I had no\r\nidea there was such a beautiful place in Sussex, such moss-grown oaks\r\nand beeches; such deep ferny and heathy glens; such still pools, in\r\nwhich all the autumnal tints are reflected; such winding forest-paths,\r\nup and down and in and out of which Lady Delawarr has driven me with her\r\ntwo ponies tandem; an infantine Medway, nearly to the source of which\r\nthe eldest boy, Cantilupe, rowed me through channels so narrow that one\r\ncould touch the great water-plants on either side. Then the house has\r\nmany delightful books and pictures, including two Sir Joshuas; and there\r\nare two other old houses, semi-deserted, but with grand castellated\r\ngateways, infinitely picturesque; and there is a monumental chapel,\r\nwhere a marble Duke and Duchess of Dorset kneel eternally by the tomb of\r\nthe many children who died before them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATEWAY OF BUCKHURST.][411]\r\n\r\n“The ‘company’ has been varied and amusing--Miss (Doll) Farquharson of\r\nInvercauld, a perfect Niagara of amusing Scottish anecdote; Mr.\r\nBroadley, of terrible review reputation; and the Roman Catholic Bishop\r\nof Portsmouth, who has propounded many quaint riddles of his own\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\n“Miss Farquharson described a minister at Invercauld, who, wishing to\r\nflatter the family, stated in his sermon that the Farquharson tartan was\r\none of the oldest dresses in the world, as it was evident that Joseph’s\r\ncoat of many colours was made of it, ‘thereby giving mortal offence to\r\nthe Duffs, who sat in the opposite pew.’\r\n\r\n“When the minister was changed, Miss Farquharson asked an old woman if\r\nshe liked the new one as well as the old. ‘Eh, I like him weel eneuch,\r\nbut he’s na sae frolicsome in the pulpit.’\r\n\r\n“I made great friends with all the family at Buckhurst, down to the\r\nlittle Margaret of three, who peoples all the forest with imaginary\r\nbears and elephants, and talks to them, and of her adventures with them,\r\nexactly as if they were realities. We picnicked on an island in the\r\nlake, dreadfully damp, but it was very merry and pleasant.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_“Burwarton, Shropshire, Oct. 23._--This is a beautiful place of Lord\r\nBoyne’s, high in the Clee hills, with glorious views of the Welsh and\r\nMalvern ranges, beyond exquisite wooded scenery. The house is modern,\r\nbut has good pictures, several representing members of the Medmenham\r\nbrotherhood, and one a Lady Paisley, an ancestress, who declared that\r\nshe did not wish to go to heaven if poor people went there. Many\r\npleasant people are here, especially a Mr. Bankes, who is very amusing\r\nabout the primitive ways of the Isle of Purbeck. At one time the people\r\nof Corfe had been very good for some time, so that the lock-up had not\r\nbeen used, and the Mayor, one Robert Taylor, had filled it with his\r\npotatoes after they were dug up. But at last there was a man who was\r\nvery naughty indeed, and he had to be put in the lock-up, though there\r\nwas scarcely room for him even to stand in it, it was so full of the\r\nMayor’s potatoes. Late that night, some people going past stumbled over\r\na great heap lying in the middle of the road--quite a huge heap. It was\r\nthe Mayor’s potatoes, which the prisoner had amused himself by throwing\r\nthrough the bars of the window: so then the Mayor was obliged to\r\ncompromise matters, and to let his victim out on condition of his\r\npicking up all the potatoes and putting them back again.\r\n\r\n“This Mayor, Robert Taylor, used to say, ‘I shall have to adjudicate\r\nupon such and such a case to-morrow.’ He kept a shop where he sold hats.\r\nOne day he saw a neighbour walking by with a very smart shiny hat, and\r\ncalled out, ‘Thomas, good-day, Thomas; you’ve got a new hat, may I ask\r\nwhere you got it, Thomas?’--‘Well, I bought it at Wareham, Mr.\r\nTaylor.’--‘Oh, you bought it at Wareham, did you? Very good, Thomas.’\r\nSome days afterwards Thomas was set upon by a man in a lonely road and\r\nvery badly beaten, really very much hurt. He went to the Mayor and said,\r\n‘Really, Mr. Taylor, I think I must take out a summons.’--‘A summons!\r\nmust you, Thomas? Well, you may just go and take it out where you bought\r\nyour hat.’\r\n\r\n“The ignorance of the people in Purbeck is intense. A clergyman preached\r\nabout Zachaeus climbing into the fig-tree, &c. An old widow woman, who\r\nhad stayed at home, asked her son if he could tell her what the sermon\r\nwas about. ‘Yes, that he could,’ he said, ‘for it was all about Jack Key\r\n(a bad character in the village), who had been up to summut, and was to\r\nhave to give half of all his goods to the poor.’\r\n\r\n“Here, at Burwarton, witchcraft is generally believed in. A tenant said\r\nthe other day that his pig was bewitched by an old woman, and that it\r\nwould certainly die, unless he could have her blood; by which he meant\r\nnothing murderous--a prick of a pin would do. Many of the neighbouring\r\nclergy are bad. At a small hill-parish near this an old woman asked the\r\nclergyman what he did for his rheumatism. ‘Well, I swear like hell,’ he\r\nsaid.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oakley Park, Oct. 17._--A lovely place, with glorious old oaks\r\nmentioned in Domesday Book. Ludlow is only 2½les off. Its castle,\r\nwhich stands grandly opposite the entrance to the drive, is associated\r\nwith Prince Arthur, ‘Comus’ was acted there, and it was thence that the\r\nPrinces were taken to the Tower. It was also from Ludlow that the\r\npilgrims came who were met in the Holy Land by St. John when he gave\r\nthem the ring to take back to Edward the Confessor, and this story is\r\nrepresented on the windows of the grand old church. Stokesay, which we\r\nhave been to sketch, is inimitably picturesque. Nothing can be kinder\r\nthan my present hostess, Lady Mary Clive, so considerate of all that can\r\ninterest or amuse one,[412] even whilst talking incessantly of her two\r\nhobbies--Conservatism and Church matters. In the latter she is just now\r\nin her glory, as the house is full of clergy for the Church Congress at\r\nLudlow, where all the ecclesiastics in the county are delighting, like\r\ndogs, to bark and bite. There is _table-d’hôte_ for them here at every\r\nmeal, and the house is like a clerical hotel.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 22, 1885._--Mother’s birthday! on which for so many years we have\r\nbeen through the Catacombs (lighted up this one day of the year) to\r\nvisit the grave of S. Cecilia. My pleasant holiday and happy visits are\r\nalready becoming dreamlike, and it is as if my last time alone here\r\ngoing on still, as I sit in my hill-set solitude. The wind whistles in\r\nthe fir-trees; a cow lows in the meadow for a lost calf; Rollo snorts\r\nwith fat, but is always ready to play with Selma the cat, though greatly\r\nannoyed at her having given birth to a numerous progeny _in_ his bed;\r\nnew pigstyes are built, and a Lawsoniana hedge is planted round the\r\nlittle garden up the steps. ‘The Holmhurst muffin-bell,’ as St. Leonards\r\ncalls it, already rung for a tea-party next Tuesday; and ‘the boys’ (now\r\nHeddie Williamson and Freddie Russell) are due for their half-holiday on\r\nWednesday; George Jolliffe is coming to stay on the 4th; and for myself,\r\nthere is constant work to be done on ‘Paris,’ where, as I labour down\r\nthe highways, a thousand by-ways of interest and instruction are ever\r\nopening up.\r\n\r\n“I have, however, a little disappointment in Smith and Elder’s account,\r\nnearly £300 to the bad again this year, and no gain whatever: so much\r\nfor the supposed riches of ‘a very successful author.’\r\n\r\n“Just now also I am being most tremendously bored with the visit of\r\nyoung ----, and am wondering if he will profit by one of George\r\nWashington’s admirable ‘Rules of Civility,’ which I am going to read\r\naloud to him. ‘In the presence of others, sing not to yourself with a\r\nhumming voice, nor drum with your fingers or feet.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Powderham Castle, Nov. 14._--I have been spending a week with Charlie\r\nHalifax in this beautiful place, which recalls the Little Gidding of\r\n‘John Inglesant’ in its intense, its real saintliness--in the constant\r\nchapel services with wonderful singing of the servants, in the\r\ncommemorative hymns for such saints as Martin and Bricius, in the spirit\r\nof harmony and universal love, which rules everything. Lord Devon[413]\r\nis absolutely seraphic. Charlie says he knows only two perfect forms of\r\nhappiness, reciting the Holy Office or attending the Board of Guardians.\r\n‘I know one thing troubles you in respect of heaven,’ says Charlie, ‘it\r\nis, that there are no boards of guardians there; but, dearest Lord\r\nDevon, if they are quite essential to your happiness, I am sure that a\r\nboard will be created in some planet, with celestial paupers for you to\r\nrelieve.’\r\n\r\n“When with the Halifaxes, I always become brimful of good intentions.\r\nBut then something comes back to me that I once heard a Countess Zitchi\r\nsay, ‘Moi, je suis tout-à-fait comme Jésus Christ, seulement il me\r\nmanque--la conduite!’\r\n\r\n“We have had a delightful twenty-seven miles’ excursion to the very\r\ncurious old desolate house of Fulford and a picnic in its deserted\r\ndeer-park. Another day, Charlie, his uncle Francis Grey, and I, went to\r\nBerry Head, a wild rock-girt promontory, with ruined walls of an old\r\nfortress, looking on the bay crowded with Brixham trawlers.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe latter months of 1885 found me quietly at home, exceedingly busy\r\nover my work on France. As at all other times, except in fine summer\r\nweather, I was chiefly alone, save when on Sundays some of my young men\r\nfriends--“the boys”--were generally at Holmhurst for two nights, being\r\nusually those whose whole life is spent in bearing--\r\n\r\n          “The work-day burden of dull life,\r\n    About the footsore flags of a weary world;”[414]\r\n\r\nfor I have always felt how much, in similar circumstances, I should have\r\ncared myself to have a friend and a homelike little refuge to go to.\r\nBesides, “although in a very humble and apparently confined sphere of\r\naction, who can tell the effect which our influence or that of our\r\nconduct may have upon others, and its reaction throughout future\r\nages?”[415]\r\n\r\nIn latter years I have had better “material” in this respect; but it\r\nmust be allowed that, except in very rare cases, those I tried to be\r\nuseful to in former days turned out very ill. Here are just a few\r\ninstances:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo. 1 was a gentleman once in a good position, who had fallen into\r\nextreme poverty. I gave up being in London, I gave up going abroad, I\r\nalways went in an omnibus instead of a cab, always travelled second\r\nclass instead of first, to have £50 a year to give to No. 1. But when I\r\nfound that my poor gentleman always took a hansom even to cross Eaton\r\nSquare, I drew in my purse-strings.\r\n\r\nNo. 2 seemed very different. Rudely nurtured, he minded no difficulties,\r\nand was willing to live hardly. He only cared for work, and his work was\r\nscience. He threw his whole life into it, and seemed on the eve of great\r\ndiscoveries--in fact, he made them. But he had no one to help him to buy\r\nthe patents that were necessary, and I spent £800 for this, and\r\naltogether many thousand pounds in his behalf. He was to have repaid\r\nthis sum if he became successful in life, but he made a very large\r\nfortune, and “forgot to pay it.” Then, having lost his fortune again,\r\nhis originality and cleverness took another direction: he suddenly\r\nturned Buddhist, cared for nothing but the divine essence, and went off\r\nto India to join a brotherhood in which, after years of prayer and\r\nfasting, he might hope to obtain the distinction of “a little yellow\r\ngarment.” He wrote then that his religion itself would prevent his ever\r\nagain forgetting that he owed me four thousand pounds with interest.\r\nYet, after his return, he repudiated his debt altogether, and denied\r\nthat he had even the slightest obligation to me. All I had spent was\r\nthrown away! No. 2 was an utter collapse.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 wanted to be married. He had led a wild life, and his marriage\r\nwould “be the saving of him;” with his marriage a new page of his life\r\nwould be turned over; but to enable the marriage to be, a loan of money\r\nwas necessary. I sent the money, but the marriage never took place, and\r\nthe loan was never returned. No. 3 vanished into chaos.\r\n\r\nNo. 4 was very engaging and I became very fond of him. He was\r\nperpetually at my home, where I always treated him as a younger brother,\r\ngiving him money when I was away for whatever he wanted. When he wished\r\nto give a party to his friends in London, the food, the wine, the\r\nflowers, came from Holmhurst. He had to work hard in a public office, so\r\nevery year I gave him money for the change of a Continental tour, and on\r\none occasion, when he had no other companion, I took him myself, and\r\nshowed him the whole of a foreign country. This went on for nine years.\r\nThen a circumstance occurred which made me feel that he, in his turn,\r\nmight, not even for one day, but for one hour, be useful to me. Under\r\nthese circumstances I asked a favour of him. “No,” it was refused at\r\nonce, “it might not be to his advantage: it might even possibly be\r\nrather inconvenient.” No. 4 collapsed.\r\n\r\nNo. 5 was a very young and ingenuous boy. I met him first when he was at\r\nOxford, when his family--country gentlefolk--were trying to compel him\r\nto take Orders. He confided to me his misery about it, and his utter\r\nunfitness. I backed him up in resisting. From that time I saw a great\r\ndeal of him. He was very affectionate to me, and I grew very fond of\r\nhim. His family, irritated at his opposition to taking Orders, refused\r\nto go on spending money upon his education. I continued it, or thought\r\nI did, by letter, sending him daily questions to answer by post, and\r\nreceiving _précis_ of History from him and correcting them. He was also\r\nvery frequently at Holmhurst for a long time together, and had more of a\r\nreal home there than with his own parents. Once, without my knowledge or\r\nthat of his family, he went to London, and got into terribly bad\r\ncompanionship and disgracefully bad habits. He was plundered of all he\r\npossessed, and had to pawn his watch to get away. To prevent the\r\ndiscovery of this, which would have hopelessly estranged him from his\r\nfamily, I redeemed his valuables for a considerable sum. He then seemed\r\npenitent, promised amendment, and took refuge at Holmhurst again. About\r\na year after I found him on the eve of wilfully making an acquaintance\r\nwhich was sure to cause his ruin. I pointed out to him the misery he was\r\nbringing upon himself, and he promised to give it up. Then I found that\r\nall the while he was promising to do nothing of the kind, he had been\r\nconstantly writing to the person in question, with whom he had no\r\nprevious acquaintance, making assignations for meetings, &c. From that\r\ntime he got into one miserable scrape after another. He sank and sank.\r\nWhenever he has made a promise, he has always broken his word; nothing\r\nhe says can be believed; his every act must be mistrusted.... Now, he\r\nhas taken Holy Orders! This is the end of No. 5.\r\n\r\nNo. 6 was very dear to me. I had known him intimately from his earliest\r\nchildhood. Exceedingly unprepossessing in appearance, he gave the most\r\nbrilliant promise of a distinguished career. To me he showed the most\r\nunbounded affection and confidence, but he never told the truth. This\r\nled to a series of miserable deceptions which caused his expulsion from\r\nschool and brought about his failure everywhere. Dreaded, mistrusted, he\r\nbecame alienated from his family, almost from his fellow-men. No\r\nopportunity of extravagant folly occurred but was greedily seized upon,\r\nto be followed by fresh falsehood. His whole life has been a sorrow to\r\nthose who know him, and who think mournfully of its beautiful “might\r\nhave been.”\r\n\r\nI met No. 7 when he was eighteen. Of very lowly origin but gentle\r\ninstincts, he had been turned adrift at seventeen upon London to earn\r\nhis own living, and he seemed at first to be earning it bravely and\r\nhonestly. He was clever and was anxious to improve himself, and he spent\r\nall his evenings in reading, and succeeded in teaching himself French.\r\nBy his own unaided efforts he had really given himself an education. At\r\nfirst I used only to lend him books and do what I could to help his\r\nreading. Then I frequently invited him to Holmhurst, and paid for his\r\ncoming there. He had a bad illness in London, when I went constantly to\r\nhim in his miserable garret, and supplied all his little comforts. About\r\na year after I first knew him, he yielded to a great temptation in\r\nmisappropriating a large sum of money belonging to the firm he was\r\nserving, and spending it in a very disgraceful manner. It seemed as if\r\nhe really did this under a diabolic influence, and as if he really\r\nbelieved that he should be able to replace the money before the theft\r\nwas discovered. But the time drew very near when his accounts would be\r\nexamined, and there was no chance--there never had been--that they would\r\nbe found correct. Then the full agony of his position came upon him, and\r\nhe confessed the whole to me and implored me to save him. The day before\r\nthe examination of accounts I replaced the stolen money, and the\r\ndefalcation was never discovered.\r\n\r\nFrom this time he seemed to go on well, and I became much attached to\r\nhim. Five times a year I paid his expenses to Holmhurst, to give him\r\ncountry air, treating him like my own son when he was with me. Then came\r\na time when, after several years, he fell into feeble health, and had to\r\nleave his situation. I was then not perfectly satisfied with the way in\r\nwhich he was going on, and did not think him as frank and candid as he\r\nhad been, but I took him home with me for a month to recruit. At\r\nHolmhurst he had every kindness and indulgence, and was received not\r\nonly as an equal, but almost as a child of the house. At the end of a\r\nmonth, he told me that he had heard of some very suitable employment in\r\nLondon, and hoped that I would not object to his going to town to see\r\nabout it. I said, “Certainly not; but what is the employment?” To my\r\nsurprise, he said that he could not tell me then, but I should know\r\nlater. I was more surprised because, when he left, he was so unusually\r\naffectionate--“I am very glad you are so fond of me, but I cannot\r\nimagine why you should show it especially to-day, as you are coming back\r\nin a few hours.” He never came back. It was many days before he wrote.\r\nThen I had a formal letter saying that, when he went up to London, he\r\nhad been received into the Church of Rome at Brompton Oratory, and\r\nenclosing a list of his possessions left at Holmhurst, and directions\r\nfor sending them. Since then he has sunk lower and lower. I have often\r\nheard of him, and always a worse account. He is utterly lost to me. That\r\nis the end of No. 7.\r\n\r\nNo. 8 was excessively good-looking, had pleasant manners, and was\r\nespecially winning to ladies. I had known his family long ago, and his\r\nhome, a very quiet rectory in a desolate fen district. When he was at\r\nOxford, I found him, like No. 5, very unhappy at being expected to take\r\nOrders, for which he honestly felt himself unfitted, and I persuaded him\r\nto tell his father that it was impossible. Then, as he was penniless and\r\nhad no prospects, it was necessary that a profession should be found for\r\nhim, and I obtained a nomination for him for the Foreign Office from\r\nLord Granville. He came to London to work for this, and he worked well.\r\nFeeling that it would be most undesirable for him to go on in London,\r\nespecially to enter the Foreign Office, knowing no one in society, I\r\ntook him out with me every day to parties, and introduced him\r\neverywhere, claiming all kindness for him as my intimate friend. His\r\ngood looks and pleasing manners made him very welcome. But he fell in\r\nlove with an Earl’s daughter. Strange to say, his suit was not rejected,\r\nthough a probation of two years was required, during which he must begin\r\nto make an income. With this view, he abandoned all thought of the\r\nForeign Office and took to the Stock Exchange. A week before the end of\r\nthe two years’ probation, the lady, of her own accord, threw him over,\r\nbut, as far as love went, her place was soon supplied. By this time,\r\ntoo, the young man had acquired _l’habitude de société_, had begun to\r\ndespise his humble relations, to cut his old friends, and a shake of the\r\nPrince of Wales’s hand finally turned his head. He scarcely speaks to me\r\nnow when we meet. He openly says that, as he has gained all he can from\r\nme, he naturally prefers “those who can be more useful” to him.\r\n\r\nNo. 9, poor fellow, was long a great anxiety to me. He was of good\r\nfamily. He fell often--fell into the most frightful vice and shame. He\r\nrepented bitterly, and then fell again worse than before. But in one of\r\nhis best and truest times of repentance, God saw that he was positively\r\nunable to cope with temptation, and he died--died most mercifully, full\r\nof faith, hope, and gratitude. This was the end of No. 9. Thinking of\r\nhim has often brought to my mind Rossetti’s lines--\r\n\r\n    “Look in my face: my name is Might-have-been,\r\n     I am also called No-more, Too-late, Farewell.”\r\n\r\nAnd yet--\r\n\r\n    “La bontà infinita ha sì gran braccia,\r\n     Che prende ciò che si rivolve a lei.”[416]\r\n\r\nAs I retrace here, on paper, the story of my failures, a sentence of\r\nBalzac comes into my mind: “Il vous arrivera souvent d’être utile aux\r\nautres, de leur rendre service, et vous en serez pen récompensé”; mais\r\nn’imitez pas ceux qui se plaignent des hommes et se vantent de ne\r\ntrouver que des ingrats. N’est-ce pas se mettre sur un piédestal? puis\r\nn’est-il pas un peu niais d’avouer son peu de connaissance du\r\nmonde?”[417]\r\n\r\nAnd then Bunyan said in his last sermon (1692):--“Dost thou see a soul\r\nthat has had the image of God in him? Love him: love him: say, This man\r\nmust go to heaven some day. Do good to one another, and if any wrong\r\nyou, pray to God to right you, and love the brotherhood.”\r\n\r\nAnd there is a line of Tasso which comes back to me in all times of\r\ndisappointment--\r\n\r\n    “Brama assai--poco spera--nulla chiede.”\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.

Ils\r\n     vivent des leurs rentes; ils ne peuvent rien gagner; tandis que\r\n     nous, nous pouvons à chaque instant augmenter notre trésor.”--LE\r\n     CURÉ D’ARS.\r\n\r\n     “La debolezza umana piange, sorride l’imortale speranza.”--_Epitaph\r\n     at Pisa._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an old print at Holmhurst which represents life in its\r\nsuccessive stages as the ascent and descent of a hill. At fifty the top\r\nof the hill is reached and the descent begins. I have passed the top,\r\nand every year must bring less power of work and action, though I\r\nscarcely feel older now than I did at five-and-twenty. But certain marks\r\nin the forehead show that age has left his card upon one; we do not\r\nknow when he called, but the visit has been paid. Well, it is the more\r\nnecessary to do all we can whilst power lasts, never talking, but\r\nacting, and recollecting that a duty once divined binds one from that\r\nmoment; while as for the abuse, public and private, received for\r\nanything attempted out of the ordinary groove, we ought ever to follow\r\nthe simple advice of Sœur Rosalie, “Faites le bien, et laissez dire.”\r\n\r\nCertainly the longer one lives one feels how, of all shams, the\r\nreligious sham is the worst--the man who talks “goody” without any heart\r\nto sympathise with sorrow or _shame_, and who thus can never help those\r\nwho struggle sadly against vice and meanness, whilst tremulously aiming\r\nat a nobler life. The same, in a wider sense, is true of almost all\r\nsermons one hears--\r\n\r\n    “Two lips wagging, and never a wise word.”[418]\r\n\r\nSo few clergymen _feel_ what they say, that it only does harm. It was a\r\nsaying of Pope Pius II., “Bad physicians kill the body, unskilful\r\npriests the soul.”\r\n\r\nIt ought not to be, but it certainly is true that the Church and\r\nReligion are _two_; and, _apropos_ of sermons and religious\r\ndiscussions, another saying of Pope Pius often comes back to me, “The\r\nnature of God can be better grasped by believing than disputing.” “Let\r\nus not be the slaves of any human authority, but clear our way through\r\nall creeds and confessions to Thine own original revelation.” With\r\nThomas Chalmers, can I not feel this?\r\n\r\nI have endless compensations for a lonely life in my pretty little home,\r\nmy sufficient means, my multitudes of friends. Besides, it is as Madame\r\nd’Houdetot wrote to Madame Necker, “Vous savez que le seul être\r\nmalheureux est celui qui ne peut ni aimer, ni agir, ni mourir, et je\r\nsuis bien loin de cette situation.” I often feel, however, that this\r\nbook would give a very false idea of my life. I recount my many visits\r\nand what I hear there because it is amusing, and I leave unnoticed the\r\nmonths and months when nothing happens, and in which I am probably\r\nemployed in quiet work at Holmhurst. With every one naturally it must be\r\ntrue that\r\n\r\n    “The life of man is made of many lives,\r\n     His heart and mind of many minds and hearts.”[419]\r\n\r\nThis, however, is enough of sentimentalising. I will return to facts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 9, 1886._--I am just come back from a very pleasant visit at\r\nBattle Abbey, where I met the Powerscourts, Lord and Lady George\r\nCampbell (she lovely and like a beautiful Gainsborough), Lord Hardinge\r\nand a very nice daughter, Lord Wolmer and Lady Maude, Sir Prescott\r\nHewitt, a young Ryder, and Lady Dorothy Nevill. The latter was most\r\namusing, and well understands the famous principle--‘Glissez, mortels,\r\nn’appuyez pas.’ She and the Duchess of Cleveland, who was in very good\r\nvein, were quite charming together.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Feb. 20, 1886._--Do you know that, except for ten days, I\r\nhave been at home just three months to-day, and nearly all the time\r\nquite alone. I cannot say how much I have enjoyed the quietude of study\r\nand communing with great and wise people through many books. There is\r\ncertainly the greatest pleasure in thus acquiring new thoughts, and, in\r\na small way, fresh knowledge: indeed, I always feel that to give myself\r\nup to overwork is quite as great a temptation to me as over-idleness to\r\nsome people.\r\n\r\n“Each different literary work I have had has seemed to me, at the time,\r\nmore interesting and engrossing. The little accidental discoveries are\r\nso amusing. Amongst those of this week, who do you think invented a\r\nwheel-barrow?--Blaise Pascal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DEANERY, BATTLE.][420]\r\n\r\n“My diversion has been reading masses of old family letters, unearthed\r\nby Lady Hartopp. They are very curious, and a complete portrait of the\r\nfamily at the beginning of the century. My grandfather, Mr. Hare Naylor,\r\nmust have been quite odious--so imperious and arrogant: Lady Jones, the\r\nincarnation of a rod in pickle, but with very fine qualities:\r\ngreat-uncle Robert, the rector, more of a rowdy farmer than anything\r\nelse. Penelope Shipley (Mrs. Warren), a very fine unselfish creature:\r\nDean Shipley, selfish and dictatorial: Francis Hare, a self-indulgent\r\ndandy: Julius, a miracle of boyish learning, talking like a Solon:\r\nAugustus (it must be allowed), very priggish, but very amiable: Marcus,\r\nindulged in everything by his aunts: the second Mrs. Hare Naylor,\r\nfoolish and querulous, but by no means an unjust stepmother. The\r\nreligious letters of consolation which the whole party write to one\r\nanother when little Anna dies are so stilted as to be truly comic. What\r\nis touching is that over the harsh letters of her fierce elder sister,\r\nthe beloved memory of the first Mrs. Hare Naylor ever broods as a\r\nsoftening influence: however much trouble the Hare brothers give her, no\r\npains or expense are too great for them, because ‘they were hers.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of February I went up to London for Miss Jolliffe’s wedding,\r\nand came in for--a revolution! On returning from the City, I found\r\nTrafalgar Square one mass of people, and many orators addressing them,\r\nbut expected nothing more. Soon, however, a Socialist leader named Burns\r\nsuggested a reign of terror and offered himself as captain. Thousands of\r\nmen--well fed, well dressed, but still the scum of London--rushed down\r\nPall-Mall, breaking windows as they went--a very carnival of outlawry.\r\nTheir passions grew with their progress, and in St. James Street they\r\nwrecked the University Club, which had expelled Hyndman, one of their\r\nleaders, from its society. They seized certain carriages, turning out\r\nthe ladies they contained, and stripped a footman of his livery. They\r\npulled Lady Claude Hamilton out of her carriage and boxed her ears, but\r\nwhen, _after_ this, she denounced them as dogs who ought to be flogged\r\nas curs, they applauded her courage, and let her go on. Breaking windows\r\nand wrecking many shops in Piccadilly, they entered the Park at Hyde\r\nPark Corner and left it at Stanhope Gate. Then they rushed on through\r\nSouth Audley Street, which they left much like Paris after the excesses\r\nof the Commune. How truly Milton said--\r\n\r\n    “License they mean when they cry Liberty.”\r\n\r\nI went the next day to see Lady Foley, whose house in Grosvenor Square\r\nhad been on their line of route. It had not only no pane of glass\r\nunbroken, but not even fragments of glass left, and stones heaped in the\r\nlibrary enough to mend a good piece of road with. Lord Percy’s house,\r\nnext door, was so ruined that they went away next day.\r\n\r\nFor the two following days London had indeed a miserable aspect--windows\r\nall broken, streets littered with fragments, shops shut, streets paraded\r\nconstantly by bands of entirely victorious and triumphant ruffians, and\r\nshop-keepers, in some cases, guarding their property with revolvers.\r\n\r\nThe call for a fresh edition of my “Walks in Rome” made me suddenly\r\ndetermine to go to Italy at the end of February. At Florence I was the\r\nconstant guest of the ever-kind Duchess Dowager of Sermoneta, with whom\r\nI made delightful excursions in the hills.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Hotel Paoli, Florence, March 7, 1886._--France was covered with snow\r\nfrom end to end, yet next day we were speeding through lemon-groves\r\nladen with fruit, and carpeted with a blaze of iris and scarlet geranium\r\nin full flower. Here, after reading about the snowstorms in England, I\r\nam glad in the gardens of Arcetri to sit to draw in the shade of the\r\ncypresses, and all the hills are pink with almond-blossom. I spent one\r\nevening with the Duchess at Palazzo Torrigiani, alone with the family\r\nthere, which is the most perfect type of a grand old Italian household,\r\nconsisting of between eighty and ninety persons. The kind and charming\r\nold Marchesa Elisabetta has four sons, who have all married as soon as\r\nthey came of age, yet none have gone farther than to an apartment of\r\ntheir own under the maternal roof, and eighteen children and\r\ngrandchildren dine with her daily, besides other guests. The four\r\ndaughters-in-law all live in the utmost harmony; the Marchesa Giulia,\r\nwife of the eldest son Pietro, and the Marchesa Margherita, who was a\r\nMalespina (which in Italy means great things), quietly giving\r\nprecedence to the Marchesa Cristina, who is a princess (Scilla) by\r\nbirth. All sat with work round a table, visitors dropped in, and it was\r\nmost easy and pleasant.\r\n\r\n“Another day, the Duchess, Miss Phillimore, and I went out by the\r\nsteam-tram to spend a day at the Marchese della Stufa’s[421] old castle\r\nof Castagnolo. We had an amusing luncheon of Italian dishes, guitar\r\nmusic and singing, a walk to pick violets, with which the hedges are\r\nfull, a visit to the green-houses and aviaries of rare birds, and we\r\nwere taken back to the tram-line, where the station is built of\r\nsunflower-stalks, which are like bamboo in their qualities.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI reached Rome on the 10th of March, warmly welcomed by a large circle\r\nof friends. In the hotel were Mrs. Tilt and Letitia Hibbert, very\r\nfamiliar to me in early days at Birtles, and with them and their very\r\ncharming sister-in-law, Mrs. Frank Hibbert (_née_ Cholmondeley), I made\r\ndelightful excursions to familiar places--Tivoli, Frascati, Albano. Sir\r\nJohn Lumley was now reigning at the Embassy and making it delightful to\r\nhis countrymen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Hotel d’Italie, Rome, March 17, 1886._--What lovely June weather this\r\nis, so very hot, so unspeakably beautiful.... I find an immense deal to\r\ndo in correcting and writing, chiefly, however, in taking away from my\r\n‘Walks in Rome,’ so very much is destroyed; indeed, Lanciani, the\r\narchaeologist in power, says, ‘If they go on like this for twenty years,\r\nthere will be nothing left of older Rome but St Peter’s and the\r\nColiseum--_if_ those.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: L’ARICCIA.][422]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 21._--What expeditions we have had! On Monday we walked through\r\nthe glen at Ariccia and round the glorious old woods of the Parco Chigi,\r\nfull of cyclamen, cytisus, blue squills, green iris, and masses of dark\r\nviolets. Then, whilst the others went on to the convent of Palazzuola, I\r\nsat to draw above the still lake, and, when they came back, we went to\r\nthe grand pine-groves of the Villa Barberini, to Castel Gandolfo, and\r\nthrough the ilex galleries in time for the evening train....

Amid all the changes elsewhere, I can\r\nalways turn with comfort to the Palatine, and have spent many happy\r\nmornings there amongst the gigantic ruins, and the groves of laurustinus\r\nand lentisc, and the huge fenochii, meditating on my past and its\r\npast.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAKE OF BOLSENA.][424]\r\n\r\nOn April 22 I went to Perugia, finding in Brufani’s excellent hotel Mrs.\r\nRobert Drummond and her daughter, and two charming Americans, Miss\r\nIsabel and Miss Lorraine Wood, domesticated at Dresden. For the next\r\nfortnight we toured about together. As to some of the most restful and\r\nhappiest days of my later years, I look back to the extreme comfort of\r\nPerugia, and the perfect view from the windows of my room, unspeakably\r\nglorious at all hours, but most of all when the rising sun was lighting\r\nup the tops of the distant mountains, whilst all the detail of the\r\nintermediate plain was lost in soft white haze. Equally delightful was\r\nthe old-fashioned inn at Orvieto, and the drives into the hills and to\r\nBagnorea and the Lago di Bolsena, returning in the carriage laden with\r\nbranches of honeysuckle and masses of anemones, violets, cyclamen, and\r\nother spring flowers. From Siena, too, we made again the interesting\r\nexcursions to Monte Oliveto and S. Gimignano.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S. DOMENICO, SIENA.][425]\r\n\r\nCrossing the St. Gothard to Basle, I turned aside to visit the whole of\r\nthe Jura country, greatly overrated, I thought, by former travellers.\r\nBurgundy was much more interesting, with its fine churches and its noble\r\ninhabited châteaux of Ancy le Franc and Tanlay. As I was dining in the\r\ntiny primitive inn at the latter, the tradesmen who held the minute\r\nshops in the village were disputing as to the superiority of their\r\ndifferent trades. The carpenter certainly won the day by winding up\r\nwith, “Et la Vierge s’est mariée avec un charpentier: elle était bien\r\nlibre de son choix, et elle a choisi--un charpentier!” Nearly the whole\r\nof June I stayed in Paris, working at the archaeological details of the\r\ntown for my book, and seeing no one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTE OLIVETO.][426]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SENS.][427]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Montbard, May 23, 1886._--I wonder if my date conveys anything to you?\r\nI had determined to evade this place if it were possible, yet here I am\r\nfor two days at the place so connected with the agonising anxiety of\r\n_our_ last journey, where Mother in her illness was laid flat upon the\r\nrailway platform, to find, when the train was gone, that the little\r\nhotel was closed, and where she was carried through the lanes to an old\r\nfarmhouse. There the people were most kind to us, and she almost enjoyed\r\nit, and dear Lea was very happy, and of its inmates both were often so\r\nanxious to hear during the after-summer of the German invasion.

Old affection\r\nfor Thomas à Becket took me thence, through the sweet acacia forests, to\r\nPontigny, since which I have been very comfortable for two nights at a\r\ncharming inn close under the shadow of this old archiepiscopal\r\ncathedral.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Hotel Noël Peter, Paris, June 6._--I am very glad to have accomplished\r\na long-wished-for visit to the historic sites of Clairvaux and the\r\nParaclete, though there is nothing whatever to see in either of them!\r\nHow I have worked since I have been here!

They\r\nhave also a camp, in which they propose to train boys for hardships in\r\nthe colonies, and the sweet little bride began her own hardships by\r\nhaving to walk two miles to this, through the wet grass and fern of a\r\ndesolate moor, carrying in a basket the cold chicken and bread which her\r\nsisters had put up for her supper.\r\n\r\n“I have been reminded how James Baillie Hamilton was at Harrow at\r\nHayward’s house, which in my time used to be Harris’s, and to have then\r\nthe reputation of being haunted. He told Catherine Vaughan that one\r\nnight whilst he was there, Albert Grey, also a senior boy in the house,\r\nrushed into his room wild with horror, and said that when he was in bed\r\nhe had seen by the moonlight a most terrible figure come in, a kind of\r\nnondescript, and that as it approached a chill as of death came over\r\nhim. Eventually it had seemed to go into a corner of the room and\r\ndisappear there. Something was arranged for Albert Grey for that night,\r\nand the friends never told at Harrow what had occurred. Years\r\nafterwards, at his camp, Baillie Hamilton met a boy called Anderson, who\r\nhad been in Hayward’s house. He told how he and another boy slept in the\r\nsame room. One night he heard his companion in an agonised tone say,\r\n‘Oh, _do_ light the candle: there is something most dreadful in the\r\nroom.’ He lighted it, and found his friend sitting on the edge of his\r\nbed, trembling from head to foot. He said that the door had opened, and\r\na horrible nondescript figure had come in, when the most terrible\r\nchill, as of death, had come over him. After a time, all seeming as\r\nusual, the boys put out the light. They had hardly done so, when\r\nAnderson himself saw the figure--the appalling figure, come towards him,\r\nand the same deathly icy chill seized him. They lighted the candle\r\nagain, when the apparition vanished.\r\n\r\n“One of the curates at Llandaff was going to the place where Miss\r\nHayward, sister of the Harrow Master, lived, and Catherine asked him to\r\ninquire if she remembered the circumstance. ‘Yes,’ she said, ‘that is\r\nexactly what happened; and that room is never used now.’\r\n\r\n“On the evening of the wedding-day I went to Chichester, where the\r\nBishop’s palace, venerable and grey, but buried in myrtles and\r\ncoronillas, and radiant with brilliant flowers, lies close under the\r\nshadow of the beautiful cathedral spire. The Bishop (Durnford), at\r\neighty-seven, is the very type of a christian scholar, perfectly\r\ncharming in conversation, equally at home in classical and in French,\r\nEnglish, and Italian reminiscence and quotation, and touchingly filled\r\nwith a generous and kindly spirit to all he meets with. Circling around\r\nhim were various relations, a brother-in-law--a pleasant old clergyman\r\nMr. Keate, nieces, two sons, Dick and Walter, the latter the pleasantest\r\nand frankest of young Eton masters, and the daughter, Miss Durnford, who\r\nis mistress of the house, and whose active energy makes all right\r\nwherever she goes, and very cheerily right too. The profuse family use\r\nof adjectives and verbs, which they unearth for themselves, was very\r\nentertaining. ‘We seem to be going to have a regular Belshazzar,’ said\r\nWalter Durnford when something more than usual appeared for luncheon.\r\n\r\n“There is much to interest in the palace, which has a charming early\r\nEnglish chapel and a grand old kitchen. The cathedral retains the human\r\ninterest of its old pavement and a few tombs, sadly mutilated or\r\ntinkered up: one of a Lady Arundel is very fine. There are curious\r\npaintings of Cadwallador and of Henry VIII. giving charters on one of\r\nthe walls, by a painter of Henry VIII.’s time, who also decorated the\r\nceiling of the very fine old dining-room in the palace. Round the town,\r\nmuch of the old wall remains, making a pleasant walk; but the most\r\ncurious building is St. Mary’s Hospital, like a church, with a great\r\nsingle nave divided at the sides by chapels, which form the little\r\ntwo-roomed houses of ten old women, presented by the Bishop and custos,\r\nwho live there rent-free in great comfort, with firing, and twelve\r\nshillings a week for their maintenance. At the end is the chapel, only\r\nseparated from the rest by an old oak screen.\r\n\r\n“With the Bishop and his party I went to Midhurst, a most attractive old\r\ntown in lovely country, and we walked through an ancient wood above the\r\nRother to the grand ruins of Cowdray, full of recollections of the\r\nPoyntz family, who, as its possessors, came in bitterly for the curse of\r\nsacrilege. When Mr. Poyntz went out in a boat at Bognor with his two\r\nsons, and the boat upset whilst Mrs. Poyntz was watching it from the\r\nhotel-window, the boys clung to the tail of their father’s coat as he\r\nheld the side of the boat in the waves, and he--who could not swim--had\r\nthe agony of feeling one after the other leave go and sink, without\r\nbeing able to help them. He himself was eventually saved by the boatmen.\r\nIn the church of Easebourne, which stands in the park, near the fine old\r\nbuilding called the Priory, is a touching tomb by Chantrey, erected to\r\nthis Mr. and Mrs. Poyntz by their three daughters--Ladies Clinton,\r\nExeter, and Spencer. As they were co-heiresses, Cowdray was obliged to\r\nbe sold, and was bought by the Egmonts.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Highcliffe, August 25._--I arrived here for my usual happy summer week\r\nwith Tina, Lady Waterford, who has been a curious contrast to the lady\r\nof the place, but in herself very pleasant. She described how Cromwell,\r\ndetermined to take ‘the golden vale of Tipperary,’ said he would take it\r\n‘by Hook or by Crook’--the two villages on either side the river--and\r\nthence the proverb.\r\n\r\n“There has been a bee-show on the lawn here, Mr. Bellairs and young Evan\r\nMaberly going amongst the bees, taking them up, and treating them just\r\nas they pleased; but it looked horrible when their hats were covered\r\nwith a crawling mass, and bees were hanging to nose and ears.\r\n\r\n“Lady Jane Ellice says that at Harewood there is one of the most\r\nsplendid collections of china--quantities of it. Formerly it all used to\r\nbe kept in the gallery in which the family live, on bureaux, tables, &c.\r\nOne evening it was all left in its usual place, and the next morning the\r\nwhole collection--everything--quite unbroken, was found on the ground.\r\nThere was never the least explanation. The china has ever since been\r\nkept in cases.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Lychett Heath, Poole, August 30._--My visit at Highcliffe was a very\r\nhappy one. ‘We have not had a single quarrel, scarcely even a dispute,’\r\nsaid Lady Waterford when I came away.\r\n\r\n“This is the beautiful house of the Eustace Cecils. The modern house is\r\nexquisitely placed amongst sandy, heathery hills, with a lovely view,\r\nacross a rich wooded foreground, of the various reaches and windings of\r\nPoole harbour. I have had much pleasant talk with Lord Eustace, and like\r\nhim immensely. We had a delightful excursion to-day, taking the train to\r\nWool, and then driving in a car to Lulworth Cove, and walking up the\r\nfine wild hills, with noble sea-views, behind it. Then we went on to\r\nLulworth Castle, stern and stately, quadrangular with round towers at\r\nthe corners, standing on a terraced base, with beautiful park and woods\r\naround. We saw the pictures, a few good family portraits of the Welds,\r\nand Charles X.’s room which he inhabited when in exile.\r\n\r\n“Thomas Weld of Lulworth, who took orders after the death of his wife,\r\nbecame a bishop, and finally (1830) a cardinal. As a layman he had been\r\nperfectly devoted to hunting, and, on establishing himself at Rome, the\r\nfirst thing he did was to procure a very nice horse and hunt vigorously.\r\nThe Pope (Pius VIII.) sent for him and said, ‘Cardinals must not hunt.’\r\nSo, for his health’s sake, Cardinal Weld took to a vehement course of\r\nwalking; but the Pope sent for him again and said, ‘Cardinals must not\r\nwalk’--adding, ‘If it is necessary for your health that you should\r\nwalk, there is a place outside the walls where cardinals do walk up and\r\ndown; you can go there.’ But Cardinal Weld died of it.\r\n\r\n“We had tea with the Bond family and the Misses Weld of Lulworth at\r\nBinden Abbey, a Cistercian ruin, of which little remains beyond\r\nfoundations near some very curious fish-ponds.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 31._--I should find it difficult to say how perfectly congenial\r\nI find Lord Eustace, or how much I could look upon him as a friend. In\r\nmany ways he is like Charlie (Halifax), but is no ceremony-lover. No, he\r\nsays he always admires Gallio--‘such an excellent straightforward\r\nman,’--and even agrees with him on the special occasion on which we hear\r\nof him.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Hardwick Hall, Suffolk, Sept. 17._--I have been spending several happy\r\ndays with the Lowthers at Campsea Ashe, pleasant in every way, with much\r\nagreeable conversation. One day, when it turned on the origin of words,\r\nMr. Lowther described how the expression of ‘never set the Thames on\r\nfire’ originated in the reproach to an unenthusiastic cook, who would\r\nnever set her _tamise_ on fire.\r\n\r\n“We went to Aldeburgh, sailing in a yacht down an estuary to a point\r\nwhere the sea has eaten up what was once the site of a considerable\r\ntown, of which only the picturesque ‘Moot Hall’ remains, stranded on the\r\nbeach. It was a still, hot, glowing day, with a sea like that of the\r\nAncient Mariner.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday we went to an old house, Parham Hall, which is a poem in\r\nitself. In this flat country it stands in a wide moat, in a desolate\r\ngrassy hollow, surrounded by old trees, the richly sculptured oriels and\r\ngables, grey, battered, and moss-grown, rising straight from the\r\nwaters.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Sept. 26._--From Campsea Ashe I went to visit Gery Cullum,\r\na friend I have long known, but never till lately been intimate with.\r\nOne of his nieces met me at the station at Bury St. Edmunds, and brought\r\nme in a dogcart through that quaint town, past abbey gateways and the\r\nchurch where Mary, sister of Henry VIII., is buried, to the fine old\r\nhouse of Hardwick, which stands beyond a park well wooded with cedars\r\nand indigenous box, and which, with its bright flowers and sculptured\r\nterraces, well deserves the name of Allegro, as contrasted with\r\nPenseroso, the old neighbouring house of Rushbrooke.\r\n\r\n“There is a great charm about the interior--not fine, but very large and\r\nmost thoroughly comfortable--a small low hall with good portraits of\r\nJames I. and Elizabeth as a child, &c.; a dining-room with family\r\nportraits; a library with curious MSS. The gardens are gorgeous in\r\ncolour, and there are delightful walks beyond, with pines of all\r\ndescriptions.\r\n\r\n“The first day, knowing my love of being taken about, Gery arranged an\r\nexcursion to Hengrave, a very fine old house, with an exceedingly rich\r\nfront and stately garden, belonging to Lady Gage,[429] and close beside\r\nit a church filled with curious tombs.\r\n\r\n“On Sunday we went to service at Hawsteads, where the church has fine\r\nold monuments of Drurys and Cullums, and we sat in a high James I. pew\r\nto listen to a ranting Irish preacher, who lost himself completely in\r\nthe mazes of his own nonsense, and finally made us laugh by the emphasis\r\nwith which he announced, ‘As it is written, my brethren, in the Duke of\r\nBookeronomy,’ &c.\r\n\r\n“On Monday we picnicked in the park of Penseroso, the old house of\r\nRushbrooke, standing in a wide moat, into which a former mistress of the\r\nplace, an unfaithful wife, was thrown by her husband, and upon which she\r\nis said to float nightly. Her picture hangs above the magnificent\r\nstaircase, and the window whence she was thrown is pointed out at the\r\nend of a suite of desolate unfurnished rooms. The house belonged to Lord\r\nJermyn, and, whatever his relation to Henrietta Maria may have been, two\r\nmagnificent cabinets of hers are here, which Lord Bristol, to his\r\ndespair, inadvertently sold, with the house, to its present possessors.\r\nHere also the church has fine tombs.\r\n\r\n“Apropos of the dispersion of family relics, Gery told me how young Mrs.\r\nLe Strange of Hunstanton had inadvertently given away an old Persian\r\ncarpet, an absolute rag, to an old woman in the village, regarding it as\r\nuseless lumber. The next night she saw the most awful apparition, whom\r\nshe recognised from a portrait as her husband’s grandmother, old Mrs.\r\nStyleman, looking most ferocious and diabolical. Soon an old neighbour\r\ncalled and said, ‘How could you venture to give away the famous carpet:\r\nyou will have old Mrs. Styleman coming from the grave to remonstrate\r\nabout it;’ and then it was explained that Mrs. Styleman, who had been a\r\ngreat heiress, and had possessed a number of beautiful things, had lived\r\nto see almost all of them dispersed and sold, owing to the extravagance\r\nof the family into which she married. At last only the carpet\r\nremained--at that time a thing of some value, and in her old age she\r\nsaid, ‘Now if ever you sell that, I swear before God that I will haunt\r\nyou till it is replaced.’ Mrs. Le Strange bought back the carpet and\r\nlaid it down in its former place, and old Mrs. Styleman has never\r\nappeared since.\r\n\r\n“From Hardwick I went to Mrs. Robert Drummond in the lovely little black\r\nand white Upton Court of the fourteenth century, which she is renting\r\nnear Eton. Over the entrance is the little figure of a monk, and in the\r\nwide porch rude old oak settees. It was a sanatorium of Merton Abbey,\r\nand the quaint old fish-tanks of the monks remain.\r\n\r\n“We went to Ockwells, the desolate and decaying old house of the\r\nNorris’s, and finding the door off its hinges, entered, and went in and\r\nout of the deserted rooms, in one of which a coat of mail was hanging\r\nup.[430]\r\n\r\n“And now I am at home again, furiously busy, alone, but never finding\r\nthe day half long enough for all I have to do. ‘Rien ne vous serait plus\r\nlaborieux qu’une grande oisiveté, si vous aviez le malheur d’y tomber.\r\nDégouté premièrement des affaires, puis des plaisirs, vous seriez enfin\r\ndégouté de l’oisiveté elle-même.’ These are words of Louis XIV.,\r\nadmirable and worth thinking of.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PORCH, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Ickwellbury Oct. 14._--A visit to Mrs. Harvey.

A very bad character in the neighbourhood, who was known to hate\r\nthe dead man, and who had been seen near the wood at the time of his\r\ndeath, was arrested and tried for the murder. All the evidence was\r\nagainst him, but he got off because, instead of measuring the footprints\r\nnear the body and then the boots of the accused, the boots had been\r\ntaken to the spot and fitted into the footprints, which allowed of its\r\nbeing said that they had been manufactured by pressing the boots into\r\nthe soft earth. The man was always afterwards suspected of the murder,\r\nbut he got work in a factory. If the subject was spoken of, he became\r\nvery violent, and prayed that the devil might take him if he was guilty.\r\nOne day, after he had been declaiming thus, he was caught by the mill\r\nmachinery and torn to pieces. The iron claw which had caught him and\r\npulled him in is that always known as ‘the Devil.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_London, Dec. 6._--Luncheon with Miss Seymour to meet Madame du\r\nQuaire,[431] who talked of the Praslin murder. She was with the old\r\nDuchesse de Grammont soon after, and Madame Alfred de Grammont was\r\nthere. They began to discuss the division of money apportioned to\r\ndifferent members of a family according to the French system, and they\r\nspoke of a member of the Praslin family whom they thought stingy. One of\r\nthem added up her different expenses, ending with--‘et puis les\r\ndix-mille francs pour l’Angleterre.’ At this Madame Alfred, who is\r\n_très-bête_, suddenly broke in with,’ Avez vous été au Bois de Boulogne\r\nce matin?’ ‘It was then,’ said Madame du Quaire, ‘that I first learnt\r\nthat the Duc de Praslin was alive, and that they knew it.” The next day\r\nthe Duc de Grammont came to call upon me, and I told him of the\r\nconversation, adding--“I know now that the Duke is alive.” He neither\r\nallowed it nor denied it. A few days after, however, the Duke came again\r\nand said, “J’ai une petite faveur à vous demander.” It was that I would\r\nnever repeat to his mother what I had said to him: it might upset her.\r\nOf course I promised, but then I _knew_ the Duke was alive.’\r\n\r\n“‘The Duke did not wish to marry Mademoiselle de Luzy: that is an\r\ninvention. He only murdered the Duchess because she was such a bore. He\r\ncertainly did not wish to marry any one else.’\r\n\r\n“Miss Seymour[432] said that the Queen of the Belgians, speaking of the\r\nPraslin murder to Mrs. Augustus Craven, said, ‘How dreadful to find one\r\nwas being murdered by one’s husband: one could not even cry out.’\r\n\r\n“Madame du Quaire was reminded of her friend Madame Solkoff, whose hair\r\nwas quite snow-white whilst she was still quite young. ‘She was a Miss\r\nChilde, you know, a daughter of that Mrs. Childe who had a salon--_un\r\nsalon très répandu_--at Paris. She eloped with a Polish Count, to whom\r\nher family objected most intensely, and she was disinherited. Very soon\r\nafter her marriage it became known that it had turned out very ill, and\r\nthat the young Countess was very unhappy. Eventually it became\r\nimpossible for her to remain with her husband, and she went to live at\r\nCracow with her mother-in-law, who had a very fine old palace there, and\r\nwas very kind to her. She had a large apartment of her own in her\r\nmother-in-law’s house, her bedroom being approached through her\r\nsitting-room. She was still only twenty-two, when she was found one\r\nmorning insensible on the floor of her sitting-room in her night-dress,\r\nand with the floor all around her saturated with blood from a terrible\r\nwound in her head. Her cabinets and jewel-cases were all broken open and\r\nrifled. The _interrogatoire_ came, and she was examined. She said that\r\nin the night she heard a noise in her sitting-room, and going to see\r\nwhat it was, had found a man breaking open her drawers; that she had\r\nreceived a blow, and knew no more. It was in vain that she was\r\nquestioned as to whom she had seen; she affirmed that she could not\r\npossibly tell who it was. But her hair was turned snow-white from that\r\nnight. It was not till she knew he was dead that she allowed it was her\r\nhusband she had seen.’\r\n\r\n“Speaking of reading novels when young, Madame du Quaire said that she\r\nremembered at eleven years old reading ‘La Princesse de Babylone,’ and\r\nbeing found convulsed with laughter at the description of a\r\ndinner-party given by the Witch of Endor. She was described as having\r\nthe guardianship of Nebuchadnezzar, who was browsing near her, and that\r\nat her party, ‘_par délicatesse pour lui_,’ she would allow nothing to\r\nappear which--in his unfortunate position--could wound his feelings--no\r\nbeef, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n“Madame du Quaire talked of the prevailing passion for Buddhism, and\r\nsaid, ‘I am not even going to attempt to believe in it, for it is not\r\nnecessary to salvation: there is such a tremendous quantity that I am\r\nobliged to swallow, that I cannot possibly undertake anything--“_che non\r\ne d’obligo_” as the Italian priests say.’\r\n\r\n“Madame du Quaire had met Lady Colin Campbell at dinner and sat opposite\r\nto her, but she did not know her. She could not help being attracted by\r\nthe necklace she wore, it was so very extraordinary. After a time it\r\nseemed to be moving by itself. She fancied at first that this must be a\r\ndelusion, but, putting up her glasses, she certainly saw the necklace\r\nwrithing round Lady Colin’s throat. Seeing her astonished look, Lady\r\nColin said, ‘Oh, I see you are looking at my snake: I always wear a live\r\nsnake round my throat in hot weather: it keeps one’s neck so cool;’ and\r\nit really was a live snake.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 8._--Sat by Sir George Dasent at breakfast. A Mr. Frere passed\r\nthrough the room. ‘He comes from Roffham,’ said Sir G., ‘one of those\r\nplaces of which the name has such a rough East Anglian sound, and he is\r\nmember of the family which possessed the Paston Letters without knowing\r\nit. There were six volumes of letters. Two of them were sent up, by\r\nrequest, for Queen Charlotte to look at, and they were lost. She was\r\nvery accurate herself, that old woman, especially about things that were\r\nlent to her, and there is no doubt that she had given them to one of her\r\nladies to return: anyhow they were lost. Afterwards, however, duplicate\r\ncopies of many of the lost letters were found to be still in the\r\npossession of the family, and their existence quite disproved an\r\nassertion that the letters had been forgeries.\r\n\r\n“‘They were wonderful people, those old Pastons. They used to thrash\r\ntheir daughters like anything if they did not behave themselves, and\r\nthen, when they had flogged them well, they would say, “And now they\r\nmust have silk dresses, rich, red, and beautiful!”’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 9._--Dined with M. B., who told me of Lady Vane[433] being quite\r\nworn-out by the ghastly noises at their place in Cumberland: it was as\r\nif some one were always trying to climb up a disused chimney in the\r\nwall, and then falling violently down again. But lately, when Sir Henry\r\nVane was away, she had the wall opened. Inside she found a wide and very\r\nlofty closet, narrowing into a funnel as it reached the roof, where it\r\nopened by a very small hole to the sky. In it were human bones, a broken\r\nwater-bottle, and the cover of an old Bible, which bore a date. Lady\r\nVane had the bones gathered up and put into a box, which was left in a\r\ncorner of Sir Henry Vane’s room till his return.\r\n\r\n“When Sir Henry Vane came home, he was exhausted by a long journey and\r\nwent at once to rest. Lady Vane did not intend to tell him of her\r\ndiscovery till the next day. But suddenly, late in the afternoon, she\r\nheard a tremendous noise in her husband’s room. She rushed in, and found\r\nSir Henry in a state of the greatest agitation. He said, ‘I have seen\r\nthe most frightful apparition--a woman in that corner,’ pointing to\r\nwhere the box of bones had been deposited.\r\n\r\n“From old family archives they found that, some years before, exactly at\r\nthe date upon the Bible cover, a woman had been walled up in the house.\r\nShe had made desperate efforts to escape up the funnel of the disused\r\nchimney, and had always fallen down again. Sir Henry and Lady Vane\r\nthemselves buried the bones in the churchyard, and the house has been at\r\npeace ever since.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Thorncombe, Dec. 13._--Miss Montgomery is here, a lady of the most\r\nimpassive countenance, though she is the authoress of ‘Misunderstood.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Warwick Castle, Jan. 30, 1887._--A delightful visit to this beautiful\r\nplace. I came off suddenly on a telegram from Lady Warwick,[434] and\r\nfound several pleasant people, besides the family. More than ever have I\r\nbeen charmed by Lady Warwick, who has the rarest of all\r\nattractions--absolute simplicity, and ‘rien n’est difficile comme le\r\nsimple,’ as Madame de Maintenon used to say. Then most glorious in\r\nposition is the castle, with the river close underneath, so that the\r\nfamily feed the swans daily from the aërial balcony outside the\r\nbreakfast-room window. Pilgrim-visitors constantly pour through the\r\nrooms with the pictures, of which the finest are a grand Morone, and a\r\nRaffaelle finished by Ghirlandajo. The visitors are conducted through\r\nthe rooms by the housekeeper, who is a great character in her way. When\r\nthe Prince of Wales was here, she showed him a relic which ‘belonged to\r\nKing James III.’--‘Ah! the old Pretender,’ said the Prince. ‘_We_ do not\r\nthink so, your Royal Highness,’ she replied very stiffly. The pictures\r\nat Warwick are a real enjoyment, not only important and valuable, which\r\nis generally thought enough, but each individually lovely and\r\nsuggestive. And the happy family life is perfection--such a sharing of\r\ninterests, the hunting sons not entirely engrossed by it, and no single\r\nmember of the family talking scandal or looking for motes in their\r\nneighbours’ eyes. The old town is charming, with the Leicester hospital,\r\nand the great church, chiefly renaissance, but with a fine gothic choir.\r\nOne evening there was a dance, and after it Mrs. Bob Lyttelton (Miss\r\nSantley), who lives in the town, sang most gloriously.\r\n\r\n“We have driven to see the exceedingly curious old house of Badeley\r\nClinton, of which my distant cousin, Mr. Dering, has married the widowed\r\nowner. It is a most singular and poetical place, and there are many\r\ncurious stories about it. Handsome, refined, and naturally, not\r\naffectedly, poetical and picturesque, Edward Dering is wonderfully\r\nsuited to the place, and its very solitariness facilitates his leading a\r\nlife there of almost mediaeval saintliness.”[435]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of February 1887 I left England again for my French work,\r\nand spent a month in Paris at a primitive and economical inn in the Rue\r\nd’Amboise. Living here, I spent my days entirely amongst the historic\r\nquarters, seeing nothing of the Boulevards or Rue de Rivoli, but making\r\ngreat progress with a work--my “Paris”--which had no interruptions, and\r\nin which I became increasingly interested as I knew more of my subject.\r\nOn the fine days of early March many excursions were very pleasant,\r\ninvolving long walks to the Abbaye du Val, Nogent les Vierges, &c.\r\nUnfortunately the weather changed before I set out on a tour through the\r\nBourbonnais; and in Provence, where many long excursions were necessary,\r\nthe mistral was quite terrific. Mounting into the wild fastnesses of the\r\nMaritime Alps above S. Maximin, to visit the cave in which the Magdalen\r\nis believed to have died, I caught a terrible chill, from which I was\r\nafterwards very ill at Manosque. But the kindly though rough proprietors\r\nof the inn--M. and Mme. Pascal--persuaded me to try the remedy of taking\r\nno nourishment whatever except hot tea, and letting nature lie\r\nabsolutely at rest for forty-eight hours, and, as often since, I found\r\nthis quite answer, though during that time I drove in an open carriage\r\nfor eight hours to visit the Roman remains at Riez.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIEZ.][436]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRIGNAN.][437]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Avignon, April 3, 1887._--It has been a suffering week, owing to the\r\nbiting, rending, lacerating mistral, which has seemed perpetually to\r\ntear one’s vitals inside out, and to frizzle them afterwards. Thursday I\r\nwent by rail to Montelimar, and then in a carriage with a horse which\r\neither galloped furiously or would not go at all, over the sixteen miles\r\nof mountain-road to Grignan, where Madame de Sévigné lived so much with\r\nher daughter, and where she died. It is a really grand and striking\r\nplace--the immense château rising on a solitary rock, backed by a lovely\r\nmountain distance, and the town at its foot surrounded by cork forests.\r\nAll was ruined at the Revolution, but the shell of the rich\r\npalace-castle remains--‘un château vraiment royal,’ as Madame de\r\nSévigné calls it. In a solitary spot near is the cave, with old\r\nilex-trees, where she used to sit, and, even with blinding dust and\r\nwind, the colouring was most beautiful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLOISTER OF CAVAILLON.][438]\r\n\r\n“On Saturday, I had to spend five hours at Cavaillon, and wondered how\r\nto dispose of myself. But, on reaching the cathedral, the whole\r\npopulation was pouring in to take part in the funeral of a famous doctor\r\nwho had been a great benefactor of the place. Every one there was\r\npresented by the family with a huge wax-candle, as long as a\r\nwalking-stick, and asked to ‘assist.’ I had one, and walked and stood\r\nwith my burning candle for two hours! It was a striking sight, thousands\r\ntaking part, and the old bishop pronouncing the elegy of the deceased,\r\nwhom he described as quite a saint. But oh! how it poured, and blew, and\r\nswelched, and how deep was the white mortar-mud of Provence!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Arles, April 13._--The visit to this place--perhaps more than any\r\nother connected with happy days of our long-ago travels, and which I\r\nhave always avoided hitherto since I have been alone--has unexpectedly\r\nproved a great pleasure. And I am glad, now I have seen so much, that I\r\nstill think Arles by far the most interesting place in the south of\r\nFrance, and the excursion to Montmajour and Les Baux, which I made again\r\non Saturday, quite incomparable--the former, as far as I have seen the\r\nworld, one of its most beautiful ruins, the latter so glorious as to\r\nscenery. Yesterday there was what the French call a bull-fight in the\r\namphitheatre, but there is nothing terrible: no horses, only men\r\nenticing bulls with handkerchiefs, and when they run at them, vaulting\r\nlike chamois over the barriers; while the arcades of Roman masonry are\r\nfilled with vast multitudes, chiefly ‘belles Arlesiennes’ in their\r\npicturesque costume--a very fine sight.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTMAJOUR.][439]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LES BAUX.][440]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Aix in Provence, April 15._--All Provence, as you perhaps know, is\r\nfull of the same very early Church legend, that a number of the earliest\r\nChristians, escaping from Jerusalem after the Ascension, landed here on\r\nthe coast and became the earliest missionaries of Gaul. Of these, Mary\r\nSalome and Mary Cleopas are supposed to have stayed at Les Saintes\r\nMaries in the Camargue, Lazarus to have gone to preach at Marseilles,\r\nRestitutus at S. Restitut, Maximin at S. Maximin; but Mary Magdalen went\r\nfarther, spent years of penitence, and died in a cave at the top of the\r\nmountains, which is certainly one of the most curious places of\r\npilgrimage in Europe. So it was to La Sainte Baume that I went\r\nyesterday, starting at 6 A.M. by rail to S. Maximin, and there engaging\r\na carriage to Nant, where the road comes to an end. Thence it is an\r\nascent of an hour and a half through the steep lonely rocky forest,\r\ncovered with blue hepaticas, over stones, rocks, and quagmires. Near the\r\ntop it began to hail and rain furiously, and the cold was most intense,\r\nsnow still lying in great masses; but the cave is very curious, and the\r\nview magnificent over the lower mountains, beyond the masses of Alpine\r\nforest. How it poured! I sheltered at the worst times under some rocks,\r\nand got safely down to the sunlit valley about five, then had to wait\r\nat S. Maximin till nine o’clock for a train, and did not get back here\r\ntill nearly one.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LES S. MARIES DE LA CAMARGUE.][441]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA SALETTE.][442]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Grenoble, April 22._--On Wednesday evening, after returning from\r\nBriançon to Gap, I engaged a carriage thence to Corps, at the foot of\r\nthe mountain of La Salette. It was supposed to be three hours’ drive,\r\nbut took five and a half hours, and we did not arrive till nine o’clock,\r\nhaving spent the last two hours in pitch darkness, with a single\r\nlanthorn, driving along the edge of the most terrific precipices, with a\r\ndriver who had never been there before! Still we arrived at last at the\r\nvery miserable inn. On Thursday morning I set off early on foot to La\r\nSalette, three hours of weary steep ascent of the mountains, rather fine\r\nin their snowy solitudes, but affording just a slight panic to a\r\nsolitary traveller owing to the bears which still prowl about there. In\r\nthe latter part of the way the snow was above my waist, but a little\r\ngulley (turned into a watercourse from the meltings) was cut through it.\r\nWhen at length I reached the convent, I was received with great\r\nastonishment, as no one had visited those solitudes since April 6. All\r\naround, and up to the first floor of the building, was deep massy snow,\r\nnot a rock to be seen. I was comfortably fed, however, and saw the\r\nstrange place to which 15,000 pilgrims come annually. You know the\r\nstory, how two children declared that the Virgin had appeared to them,\r\nand told them that the bad language of the neighbouring villages was so\r\nshocking that she could no longer restrain the avenging hand of her Son\r\nunless a church was built. You will remember how Madame de Trafford\r\nnever varied in her account, that she was herself botanising in those\r\nmountains in one of her eccentric expeditions, and came suddenly out of\r\na fog upon two children, to whom she spoke of the shocking language she\r\nhad heard, saying it was sure to be punished, and why was there no\r\nchurch? &c.: then the fog became very thick again, and when it cleared,\r\nthe children were gone.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Cambrai, April 30._--How I thought of you to-day when I was by the\r\ntomb of Fénelon, which has a striking statue. But how ugly, how\r\ntreeless, how black with coal-dust is all this north-east of France. I\r\nalways imagined the Ardennes were pretty, but the beauty is only in the\r\nBelgian part. Nothing can be more frightful than Sedan, Charleville,\r\nMezières, Valenciennes, and this place is also hideous; though perhaps\r\nall has looked worse than usual under a black sky and incessant rain.\r\n\r\n“On Thursday I saw Domremy, which is well worth a visit, and can be\r\nlittle altered from the time of Jeanne Darc. Seen across the flat\r\nmeadows, backed by a low range of hills like Hawkestone, and with a\r\nwinding stream (the infant Meuse) like the Terne, it is really a little\r\nlike Stoke. The mere hamlet ends in the little church, hung all over\r\ninside, and very prettily, with wreaths and banners, sent from all\r\nquarters in honour of Jeanne; and close by is her quaint old cottage,\r\ncarefully preserved, with some of its old beams, an ancient armoire,\r\n&c., and its original garden. It is now in the hands of Sisters of\r\nCharity, who manage an orphanage joining her garden and established to\r\nher memory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOMREMY, VILLAGE STREET.][443]\r\n\r\n“It is really a great reward for many _misères de voyage_ that I have\r\nnow seen almost everything in Eastern France, and may soon think of\r\npublishing that part of my work.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE OF JEANNE DARC.][444]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EMBRUN.][445]\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of this French tour I had an unpleasant\r\nadventure, which excited more attention than I ever anticipated at the\r\ntime. On April 19 I had gone from Gap to visit Embrun, a curious little\r\ntown in the Alpes Dauphinoises. I had not long left the station before I\r\nwas aware that I was watched and followed wherever I went. However, at\r\nlast I contrived to dodge my pursuer, and made, from behind a wall, the\r\nsketch of the cathedral which I wanted, and then had dinner at the\r\nhotel. When I was returning to the station, separated by a desolate\r\nplain from the town, I saw, by the faint waning light, the same figure\r\nfollowing wherever I went. It was dark when the train by which I was to\r\nleave was to start. I had taken my place, and the train was already in\r\nmotion, when it was stopped, and an official accompanied by a gendarme\r\nentered the carriage and demanded what I had been doing at Embrun.\r\n“Visiting the cathedral.” “Why should I visit the cathedral?” and so on,\r\nthrough a long series of questions of the same kind. My passport was\r\ndemanded, and, though not usually considered necessary for English\r\ntravellers, I happened to have one. It was, however, refused as an\r\nidentification, not being dated in the present year. Fortunately, I\r\nrecollected having in my pocket-book an order from the Préfet de la\r\nSeine authorising me to draw in all the palaces in Paris and elsewhere\r\nin France, and this was considered sufficient. The train was allowed to\r\nmove on just as a crowd was collecting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHÂTEAU DE VIZILLE.][446]\r\n\r\nAt Briançon (where I spent the following day), I carefully abstained\r\nfrom drawing, as it was a fortified town. But on April 23 I left the\r\nstation at Vizille to visit the old château of the famous Lesdiguières,\r\ntwo miles distant. I had seen the château, and began to occupy the\r\nquarter of an hour which remained before the omnibus started for the\r\nstation by sketching it from the village street, when I was pounced upon\r\nby a gendarme. “Who has authorised you to sketch the château of\r\nVizille?”--“No one.”--“If you can draw this, you may also have drawn\r\nother places. You will go with me to the gendarmerie;” and I was marched\r\nthrough the long street of Vizille, followed by a crowd, and with the\r\nhand of the gendarme occasionally grasping me by the shoulder. At the\r\ngendarmerie a superior officer appeared, and, with the most extreme\r\ninsolence of manner, demanded what I had been doing in France, &c. “What\r\nhad I drawn?”--“Churches and mountains.”--“Ah! mountains! then it has\r\nbeen very easy for you to make a little mark in the drawing, known only\r\nto yourself, meaning here is a fortress, and there a fortress.”--“But I\r\nam an Englishman.”--“Oh, you are, are you? Then I am all the more glad\r\nthat we have taken you, for we shall probably soon be at war with\r\nEngland, and then you will make your sketches useful to your Government;\r\nso you will consider yourself under arrest.” The letter of the Préfet de\r\nla Seine was treated as worthless because it had no seal. The passport\r\nwas rejected altogether with contempt. After this, all further\r\nprotestations and remonstrances were answered by an insolent shout\r\nof--“Taisez vous donc, vous êtes en état d’arrestation.”\r\n\r\nThen the first gendarme was sent with me to the station, where my\r\nportmanteaux were opened and ransacked, the contents being tossed out\r\nupon the platform. Two suspicious articles were found. First, a slight\r\nsketch of the gorge at Sisteron (not the fort; the fort is on the other\r\nside of the rock), and, far worse, three volumes of the _Guide Joanne_\r\nfor France. “What did I want with guidebooks?”--“To study the\r\ncountry.”--“Ah! that is just what I thought;” and all the officials of\r\nthe station were called in to witness the discovery. The gendarme then\r\ndeclared that I must return with him and be locked up at Vizille, but a\r\ntrain coming up at that moment, I made a dash into it, and probably\r\nthinking a public scrimmage impolitic, the gendarme allowed the\r\nstation-master to fasten my boxes and bring me a ticket. The gendarme\r\nthen took his place opposite to me in a first-class carriage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUAYS OF GRENOBLE.][447]\r\n\r\nAt 5 P.M. the train arrived at Grenoble. At the station the gendarme of\r\nVizille summoned a gendarme of the town, and I was conducted as a\r\nprisoner by the two to the Hotel Monnet. The gendarme of Vizille then\r\nleft me in care of the other, shut up in a room of the hotel, where the\r\ngendarme of Grenoble sat silent opposite to me till 6.30. I thought that\r\nthen the other gendarme would come back from the Préfecture with an\r\norder that I was to be freed from further annoyance. Not a bit of it! He\r\ncame back with an order that all my possessions were to be carefully\r\nransacked, and all the contents of my boxes were turned out upon the\r\nfloor. All suspected articles--all my sketches, manuscripts, letters,\r\nand all the volumes of the _Guide Joanne_ were then put into my smallest\r\nportmanteau, which one of the gendarmes carried, and I was marched\r\nbetween the two to the old palace of the Dauphins, where the courts are.\r\nHere two clerks (or secretaries of the Préfecture) subjected me to a\r\nlong examination--who I was, what was my employment, where I had been,\r\n&c. The English letters found in my blotting-book (ordinary family\r\nletters) were translated into French by a clerk who understood English.\r\nAll my drawings (chiefly of church architecture) were examined in\r\ndetail, and their objects inquired into. The terrible _Guides Joanne_\r\nwere passed in review and, after an hour, I was told I was free, but\r\nwithout a single word of apology or regret. Indeed, I should not have\r\ngot away then if at last one of the clerks had not said in his insolent\r\nmanner, “Est que vous êtes donc un tel, qu’il n’y a une seule personne\r\ndans toute cette partie de la France qui peut répondre de vous?” And\r\ngoaded to desperation I answered, “Well, yes, there is one person, it is\r\na lady; she is only a few miles from here now (at Aix les Bains): it is\r\nthe Queen of England.” On parting, the gendarme of Vizille was told in\r\nmy presence that he had only done his duty in arresting me for having\r\nventured to draw the Château of Lesdiguières; and he left, carrying off\r\nin his pocket (by accident no doubt) a sealed packet which he had taken\r\nfrom my dressing-case, saying, “Nous allons ouvrir ça devant ces\r\nmessieurs, ça doit être des instruments pour tirer des plans.” I called\r\nthe next day upon my examiners to ask them to obtain restitution of the\r\npacket, but they declined to take any trouble. One of their comrades,\r\nlooking up from his writing, said insolently, “Puisque vous avez été\r\narrêté hier, est-ce qu’on ne vous a encore condamné?”\r\n\r\nI wrote this story in the train, and posted it at one of the stations to\r\nthe editor of the _Times_, who inserted it in the paper, so that when I\r\nreached home I found England ringing with it, and a question asked in\r\nthe House about it. I also complained to the Foreign Office, and Lord\r\nSalisbury sent me afterwards the French answer to the inquiries made.\r\nThey allowed the facts of the examination, but denied that I had ever\r\nbeen arrested, though the leading feature through the whole had been\r\nthat whenever I attempted to speak I had been silenced by a shout of\r\n“Taisez-vous donc; rappelez-vous donc que vous êtes en arrestation.” The\r\nsealed packet was never restored.\r\n\r\nI returned home on May 3, and at the beginning of June was at Scotney\r\nCastle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Scotney, June 1, 1887._--We have been for the day at Glassenbury, the\r\nold moated house of Mr. Atkin Roberts, in a wooded hollow of the hills,\r\nsurrounded by fine old trees, but of damp and dismal aspect. There is a\r\nlime avenue there, haunted by a lady--once Miss Roberts--who is always\r\nlooking for her husband, for as she was riding away with him down the\r\navenue on their wedding-day, he was thrown from his horse and killed on\r\nthe spot. She never afterwards left the paternal home, where there are\r\npictures of her, unmarried and as a widow. Some hundred years ago the\r\nlast Roberts of Glassenbury had only daughters, and of these the last\r\nmarried the then Duke of St. Albans. The Duke was a gambler and a\r\nspendthrift, and sold all her fine things--her diamonds, her plate, her\r\nchina; but she was determined that he should not make away the place,\r\nand that she would leave it to those who would take care of it; the\r\nquestion was--to whom?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCOTNEY CASTLE.][448]\r\n\r\n“One day she had sent for a painter to come to Glassenbury to paint a\r\ncoat of arms on her carriage, and, when she showed him the arms, he\r\nsaid, ‘Why, your Grace, those are the very arms I was employed to paint\r\nat a place in Ireland, to which I went quite by accident, having been\r\nshipwrecked on the coast close by.’ The Duchess inquired, and found that\r\nthe people in Ireland, for whom he had painted the arms, were very\r\ndistant relations, and she settled the property upon the Irish Colonel\r\nRoberts, who left it to the present owner, his nephew, formerly Atkin.\r\n\r\n“Sir Arthur Birch, who has some high appointment at the Bank of England,\r\nhas lately been at Scotney, full of a very singular circumstance. He had\r\ntwo clerks, an elderly Mr. Sperati and a Mr. Lutwich, and they were very\r\nintimate friends. One Whit-Monday evening, as he was sitting with his\r\nwife by the fire in his house in Burlington Gardens, Mr. Lutwich, with a\r\nvery scared look, bade her mark the exact time, ‘for,’ said he, ‘I have\r\njust seen Sperati; he has just appeared in this room, as distinctly as I\r\never saw him in my life. He wore a very old coat of his, which I know\r\nquite well, and had a very peculiar silver-knobbed stick in his hand; I\r\nam certain he is dead, and I must go to his house and see.’\r\n\r\n“But the wife urged him so much not to go then, and to wait till the\r\nnext morning, that he assented.\r\n\r\n“As he was on his way in the morning to Sperati’s house, he met\r\nSperati’s brother, who said, ‘I was on my way to tell you sad news; my\r\nbrother died last night at nine o’clock, very suddenly, of\r\nheart-disease.’ It was exactly the hour at which Mr. Lutwich had seen\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lutwich went on to the house, and saw the butler, whom he knew\r\nwell. He said, ‘I have an especial reason for asking about an old coat\r\nwhich I remember well, and which your master use to have--has he worn\r\nit lately?’--‘Well, it is strange you should ask about it, sir, because,\r\nthough he has not worn it for some time, he had it on last night.’--‘And\r\ndo you remember what stick he had in his hand?’--‘Yes, perfectly, sir,\r\nit is in the hall now,’ and it was the very stick with which he had\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Papillon had been telling the Husseys of a very famous female\r\nmesmerist living in Park Street. Late one night this person had a\r\nvisitor who urged her very much to consent to go at once to a mysterious\r\npatient, to whom she could only travel blindfolded. She hesitated for\r\nsome time, but finally, being very much urged, she assented. A\r\nwell-appointed carriage was at the door, in which she was driven to the\r\nrailway. In the train she was blindfolded. Several hours were passed in\r\ntravelling by train. Then she was taken out to a carriage and driven for\r\nsome distance. On arriving at a house, she was led up a staircase and\r\ninto a large room. As her bandage was removed, she saw two ladies in\r\nblack just leaving the room. A gentleman was lying in bed, very\r\ndangerously ill of typhoid fever. She mesmerised him and he fell asleep.\r\nWhen he awoke, a great change for the better was perceptible. He said,\r\n‘I feel better; I could drink a glass of beer.’ She said, ‘Give him the\r\nbeer.’ He drank it, and fell into a restful, natural sleep.\r\n\r\n“Then the lady was blindfolded again and conveyed back in the same way\r\nin which she came. When she reached her own house in Park Street, a\r\ncheque for a very large amount was left in her hands. The next day she\r\nread in the paper that the Prince of Wales--then most dangerously ill at\r\nSandringham--had rallied, and fallen into a deep natural sleep from the\r\nmoment of drinking a glass of beer.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Hussey told me that an old Mr. and Mrs. Close of Nottingham were\r\nvery rich and great misers, and they both made wills leaving all they\r\npossessed each to the other. However, as they died within a few hours of\r\neach other, that made very little difference to anybody.\r\n\r\n“When the heirs-at-law arrived at Nottingham--young people full of\r\nspirits--they were greatly excited and brimming with curiosity. It was\r\nknown that there were splendid diamonds, and that vast wealth of every\r\nkind existed, but at first nothing seemed to be forthcoming. Cupboards\r\nand drawers were ransacked in vain. Nothing particular was found.\r\n\r\n“At last, in a room at the top of the house a great trunk was\r\ndiscovered. ‘Here,’ they said, ‘it all is; we shall find all the\r\ntreasures now.’ But when the trunk was opened, the upper part was found\r\nto be full of nothing but scraps of human hair, as if for years the\r\noff-scourings of all the old hair-brushes had been collected; then below\r\nthat was a layer of very dirty old curl-papers; and the bottom of the\r\nbox was full of still more dirty old corsets of ladies’ dresses,\r\nand--the box was alive! When young Mrs. Close had dived into the box,\r\nshe exclaimed, ‘What disgusting old creatures our relations must have\r\nbeen! This horrible mess might infest the whole house; we must have it\r\nburnt at once.’ So she had some men up, and the trunk carried down into\r\nthe courtyard of the house, and a huge bonfire made there, and the\r\ntrunk upset into it.\r\n\r\n“As it was burning, she stood by, and heedlessly, with her stick, pulled\r\none of the curl-papers towards her, and poked it open at her feet. It\r\nwas a £50 note! In an agony, she scrimmaged at the fire, and raked out\r\nall she possibly could, but it was too late; most of the notes were\r\nburnt; she only saved about £800.\r\n\r\n“Naturally her husband was furious, and of course he was very unjust.\r\n‘Any one but you would have examined the box carefully; there never was\r\nsuch an idiot of a woman,’ &c. And every time he saw the burnt heap in\r\nthe courtyard, he burst forth afresh. So she sent for the dustman round\r\nthe corner, and had all the ashes carefully cleared away.\r\n\r\n“Still nothing had been found of the diamonds. They had certainly\r\nexisted; there were always the diamonds to fall back upon. But though\r\nthey searched everywhere, nothing could be found of them. At last they\r\nasked the only old lady with whom Mrs. Close had visited if she knew of\r\nany one who could help them. ‘Yes, certainly,’ she said; ‘there’s old\r\nBetty Thompson at the almshouses, she was always in and out of the house\r\nas charwoman; she knew more of Mrs. Close and her ways than any one\r\nelse.’ So away they went to the almshouses, and asked Betty Thompson.\r\n‘Oh yes,’ she said, ‘she knew very well that there were diamonds, very\r\nfine diamonds indeed, but small good _they_ ever did to old Mrs. Close,\r\nfor she always kept them sewn up and hidden away in her old stays.’\r\n\r\n“The stays had all perished in the fire; the diamonds would not have\r\nburnt, but then the very ashes had been thrown away; there was no trace\r\nleft of them. The bank-notes were all very old--the few that were\r\nsaved--but they were quite good; but there was very little else left of\r\nthe great inheritance.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ LOUISA, MARCHIONESS OF WATERFORD.\r\n\r\n“_Jermyn Street, June 16, 1887._--London is in gala costume, the streets\r\nflooded with flowers, and the West End thoroughfares lined by stands,\r\nwith seats covered with red and gay awnings. I am perpetually thinking\r\nof what Arthur Stanley’s ecstasy would have been on looking forward to\r\nhaving so many kings and queens, besides no end of other royalty, in the\r\nAbbey at once. On Saturday I was at Osterley, where the gardens were\r\nquite lovely and delicious in the heat, and yesterday there was a\r\npleasant party at Lord Beauchamp’s, with little comedies to amuse\r\nPrincess Mary, who was exceedingly gracious and kind to me.\r\n\r\n“Alas! we are expecting the news of Theodore Walrond’s death--a man\r\napparently as healthy in body as in mind till his last illness set in,\r\nand quite universally beloved.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 17._--Yesterday I had luncheon with Miss Geary at her very pretty\r\nhouse in Grosvenor Street, and met Lady Elgin and a charming, fresh,\r\nsensible Miss Boscawen. I dined at Lady Manners’, where I made rather\r\nfriends with Lord Apsley: afterwards there was a large brilliant party\r\nat Mrs. Portman’s.\r\n\r\n“To-day my two young American friends, Sands and Martin, gave a most\r\npleasant luncheon. I sat by Lady Middleton, who talked charmingly and\r\ngratefully of the happiness of married life--the pleasure to a woman of\r\nentire self-renunciation: then of her own life, which she would not\r\nexchange for any in the world, though she has had to give up all her own\r\ninclinations, and to throw herself absolutely and entirely into the\r\ninterests of hunting. She said she never allowed an ill word on the\r\nfield, and if she heard one, rode even for miles till she caught up the\r\nculprit to say so.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 19._--Lady Dorothy Nevill has been most funny about a burglary at\r\nLady Orford’s. While the family were away, a man came to the door, who\r\nsaid he was sent to measure the dining-room chimney-piece, and asked the\r\nold woman who was taking care of the place to go up to the top of the\r\nhouse to get him a piece of tape for the purpose. When she came down,\r\nthe man was gone, and so were two of the best pictures. ‘I could swear\r\nto the pictures anywhere,’ said the old woman afterwards, ‘for they were\r\nof members of the Orford family.’ ‘They _were_ the Virgin Mary and St.\r\nSebastian,’ added Lady Dorothy, ‘and I leave you to imagine how far\r\n_they_ were ever likely to have been members of the Orford family!’\r\n\r\n“At breakfast I sat by Sir George Dasent. I spoke of his wonderful\r\nmemory. He said, ‘When I was a boy, my father saw me writing--writing\r\nwith a pen was never a strong point with me--but still I was busy at it,\r\nand he asked me what I was doing. I said, “Writing down what I’ve\r\nread.”--“Don’t write it down, my boy,” he said; “carry it all in your\r\nhead; it is much better,” and I have always done so.’\r\n\r\n“He spoke of the folly of interfering in any street rows. ‘It had been a\r\nwet day, and you know when the pavement is wet--why I cannot tell--you\r\ncan see much farther than at other times, and down the whole length of\r\nEaton Place I saw a man knock a woman down; she got up, and he knocked\r\nher down again. He knocked her down several times running. At last I got\r\nup to him and said, “You villain, to knock a woman down like that; how\r\ncan you dare to do it?”--“Now you just go along with you,” said the\r\nwoman; “he only gave me what I deserved.”--“Oh, if you like being\r\nknocked down, it’s another matter,” I said.’\r\n\r\n“‘One day in the street,’ he related, ‘I passed a party of Germans\r\nabusing each other with most outrageous language, and I said, “Remember\r\nthere are police here as well as in Germany.” When I got near St Peter’s\r\nChurch, I was aware that one of the Germans was following me, and he\r\ncame up and said, “I am come to demand satisfaction.”--“Very well, you\r\nshall have satisfaction,” I said, and I beckoned a policeman from the\r\nother side of the street, who came across saying, “What can I do for\r\nyou, sir?” for all the police know me. So I said, “You will just take\r\nthis man up, and I will go with you and appear against him.” So we went\r\non our way, the policeman, the German, and I. When we had gone some way,\r\nthe policeman said, “It’s giving you a great deal of trouble, sir,\r\nisn’t it, to go to the police-station; couldn’t we manage it here?’ So I\r\nsaid, “Yes, perhaps we may as well try him here. If he kneels down in\r\nthe gutter in the mud and prays for forgiveness, we will let him off.”\r\nSo I said in German, “He (the policeman) says that if you kneel down in\r\nthe gutter and beg for forgiveness, he will let you off.”--“May not I\r\nkneel on the pavement?” he said. “No, that will not do; you must kneel\r\nin the mud, with your hands up so. “So down in the mud he went and said,\r\n“I am very sorry for vat I have done,” and we let him go.’\r\n\r\n“Chief-Justice Morris said he was sitting on the bench in Ireland, and\r\nafter a case had been tried, he said to the jurymen, ‘Now, to consider\r\nthis matter, you will retire to your accustomed place,’ and two-thirds\r\nof them went into _the dock_.\r\n\r\n“Another time he said to a culprit, ‘I can produce five witnesses who\r\nsaw you steal that cow.”--‘Yes,’ said the prisoner, ‘but I can produce\r\nfive hundred who did not.’\r\n\r\n“Sir George Dasent said he should not go to the Abbey on the Jubilee\r\nDay. His legs were so infirm now, that a touch would upset him, and,\r\nwhen once down, he could not get up again. He had once been knocked down\r\nby a newspaper--‘retributive, you might say.’”[449]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 20._--The streets are all hung with scarlet and blue draperies,\r\nand Waterloo Place is embowered in a succession of triumphal arches. The\r\ncrowds are tremendous. The foot-passengers have already expelled the\r\ncarriages from the principal thoroughfares, and two million more people\r\nare expected to arrive to-day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT WESTMINSTER.][450]\r\n\r\n“I dined last night with Charlie Halifax, meeting Lady Morton, the\r\nArundel Mildmays, and Sir Hickman Bacon--a pale frail youth, so\r\nHigh-Church that he could not take part in any Jubilee gaieties\r\nwhilst ---- (one of their especial clergy) was imprisoned. Charlie was\r\nvery funny in his tantrums against the bishops. ‘I hate them all except\r\nLincoln, and--as cowards--I despise them.’ He said he would not go to\r\nthe service in the Abbey, because he considers it desecrated by having\r\nseats erected over the altar!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_June 21, 1887._--Nothing can have been more sublimely pathetic than\r\nthe whole ceremony (of the Jubilee)--more inexpressibly touching and\r\nelevating. The Abbey, too, did not look spoilt: all the tiers of seats,\r\nall the galleries disappeared utterly: nothing was visible between the\r\ntime-worn pillars and under the grey arches but the masses of people\r\nthey contained.\r\n\r\n“I went at 8 A.M. It was not a moment too soon. Cabs charged two pounds\r\nto the Abbey, but I walked very comfortably. The tickets had little maps\r\nof the Abbey, with the entrance for the bearer marked on each. Mine was\r\nby a door on the north-east behind St. Margaret’s, and there I waited,\r\nwith a small crowd, till nine struck, and some iron gates were opened by\r\nthe police, when we ran down an awned passage to where a staircase of\r\nrough timber led up by the great Norris tomb to our places.\r\n\r\n“Mine was simply perfect, a splendid place, from whence--\r\n\r\n    ‘To see the lords of human kind go by,’\r\n\r\nas Goldsmith says. I would not have changed it with any other in the\r\nbuilding. In the theatre it would have been the royal box--a little red\r\ngallery to hold four, over the tomb of Aylmer de Valence; in front of\r\nthe gallery on the left of the sanctuary; close above the princesses of\r\nAustria, Spain, and Portugal; opposite the kings; with a view of the\r\npeers and peeresses in the right transept, and so near the Queen that\r\none could see every play of her expression. My companions were a doctor\r\nof music in his red gown and two females of the middle class, who were\r\nvery good-natured in lending me their glasses.\r\n\r\n“The time of waiting did not seem long: all was so full of interest.\r\n\r\n“The Abbey blazed with colour--crimson uniforms, smart ladies, ushers\r\nstiff with gold embroidery, yeomen of the guard in plumed helmets. Only,\r\nfor another coronation, I would clothe the supporting pillars of the\r\ngalleries with red cloth. The grey wooden supports looked cold, and\r\ntheir angular outlines drew attention to them amongst the rounded forms\r\nof the pillars, whereas the red seats and galleries disappeared\r\naltogether, or only served as admirable setting and background to the\r\npicture. The grand old tombs--Aylmer de Valence, Edmond Crouchback, Anne\r\nof Cleves--stood detached from the red, and in front of the altar the\r\nmosaic pavement of Henry III. was left exposed--not covered, like the\r\nrest of the floor, by red carpeting. Near the altar were two benches on\r\neach side--‘tabourets’--for queens and princesses in front, kings and\r\nprinces behind. Farther back stood, on a daïs, the coronation chair,\r\nfacing the altar, covered and hidden by red, and with the royal robe of\r\nstate hanging over it and trailing down from the daïs on the side\r\ntowards us: before it was a fald-stool and kneeling cushion.\r\n\r\n“Every moment the vast edifice became more filled with colour, but the\r\npeers and peeresses arrived very gradually. Lady Exeter, beautiful\r\nstill, sat long alone in the marchionesses’ seats, Lord and Lady Cross\r\nin the ministerial benches, and two or three duchesses in that appointed\r\nfor them. Then the Argylls came in, he gorgeous in the uniform\r\nof--MacCallum More. Behind I recognised the Spencers, Powerscourts,\r\nStanhopes, Charlie Halifax, and Lord Londonderry with the white ribbon\r\nof the Order of St. Patrick. The Lord Chancellor, preceded by mace and\r\nbag, now came in and took his place in the centre of the front row, with\r\nLord and Lady Salisbury and the Duchess of Marlborough on his right\r\nhand. A figure which attracted more attention than any other was that of\r\nMaria, Lady Aylesbury, except her three Cambridge cousins and her two\r\npages, the sole survivor of all those represented in the great picture\r\nof the Queen’s coronation.\r\n\r\n“At 11.15 a burst of music announced the first procession, and Princess\r\nFrederica and the Tecks were conducted to the stalls, with two of the\r\nEdinburgh children, and three gorgeous Eastern princes[451] to the\r\nplaces immediately below us. Then the Queen of Hawaii, in a black dress\r\ncovered with green embroidery, and with the famous yellow feathers only\r\nallowed to Sandwich Island royalty, was seated just opposite to us, with\r\nher princess-sister[452] (the heiress of the throne) in black velvet\r\ncovered with orders, and with a great white ostrich fan:--not together,\r\nhowever, as every one was to sit according to rank, and an intermediate\r\nplace after queens had to be reserved for the Duchess of\r\nMecklenbourg-Strelitz.\r\n\r\n“A long tension of waiting followed, but at twelve a rising of the\r\nwhite-robed choristers in their south-western gallery announced the\r\nsecond procession, and a flood of royalty poured in beneath us. Opposite\r\nsat the kings of Greece, Denmark (his father), the very handsome king of\r\nthe Belgians, whose beard is beginning to turn grey, the king of Saxony,\r\nthe Crown Princes of Austria, Portugal, Würtemburg, and Sweden, the Duc\r\nd’Aosta, and Prince George of Greece--a charming boy in a naval uniform.\r\nBeneath us were the Crown Princess of Portugal, Doña Eulalia of Spain,\r\nthe hereditary Duchess of Mecklenbourg, and Princess Philip of\r\nSaxe-Coburg. One of these royal ladies--Doña Eulalia, I think--had a\r\nwhite lace mantilla instead of a bonnet, with very pretty effect. But\r\nreally one of the finest features of the whole was the coming in of the\r\nQueen of the Belgians--so simple, royal, imperial--saluting everybody in\r\ncomprehensive though slight inclination, infinitely graceful and regal\r\nin every attitude.\r\n\r\n“At last a blaze of trumpets announced the Queen’s procession. It was\r\nheaded by canons, the Bishop of London, the two Archbishops in most\r\ngorgeous copes, and the Dean of Westminster in a heavy old embroidered\r\ncope to his feet, which made him look like a figure risen from one of\r\nthe old altar-tombs. Then--alone--serene--pale (not red)--beautifully\r\ndressed in something between a cap and bonnet of white lace and\r\ndiamonds, but _most_ becoming to her--perfectly self-possessed, full of\r\nthe most gracious sweetness, lovely and lovable--the Queen! All the\r\nprincesses in the choir, with the Queen of the Belgians at their head,\r\ncurtseyed low as she took her place upon the throne, from which the long\r\nrobe of state trailed so that it looked part of her dress.\r\n\r\n“When she was seated in lonely splendour, the princes poured in upon her\r\nright, and the princesses on her left, and took their places on gilt\r\nchairs on either side--a little behind. The bevy of granddaughters, in\r\nwhite and pale blue, was very pretty--so many, all curtseying as they\r\npassed the Queen, and she smiling most sweetly and engagingly upon them\r\nwith the most loving and motherly of looks.\r\n\r\n“Then came the burst of the ‘Te Deum.’ The silver trumpets at St.\r\nPeter’s seemed as nothing to the trumpet-shout which gave effect to the\r\nexultant sentences, pealing triumphantly through the arches, and\r\ncontrasting with the single voices of solitary choristers thrilling\r\nalone at intervals--voices far, far away, like the tenderest echo. The\r\nQueen did not shed a tear, and held a book all the time, but once sat\r\ndown as if it was too much for her, and often looked round at the Crown\r\nPrincess--who stood nearest, very sweet and sympathetic--with a look of\r\n‘_What_ this is to us!’ Princess Beatrice and the Grand Duchess Sergius\r\ncried the whole time.\r\n\r\n“A striking figure throughout the entire service was the Crown Prince of\r\nGermany, especially when kneeling erect like a knight, in jackboots, but\r\nwith folded hands and a simplicity of unwavering devotion.\r\n\r\n“Very solemnly, audibly everywhere, the Archbishop of Canterbury read\r\nthe prayers--the thanksgiving for all the mercies of the reign, the\r\npetition for eternal life. There was another psalm, sung most\r\ngloriously, then an anthem with a burst of trumpets in the ‘To be king\r\nfor the Lord thy God.’ Lastly, the benediction, in which the Queen bent\r\nlow, lower, lower, as the ‘Amen,’ sung over and over again, died away in\r\nvanishing cadences.\r\n\r\n“When it was quite silent, in a great hush, she rose up, and a beautiful\r\nray of sunshine shot through the stained windows and laid itself at her\r\nfeet, and then passed on and gilded the head of the Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\n“She beckoned to him afterwards, and he came and kissed her hand, but\r\nshe kissed him twice most affectionately. Then came the Crown Prince and\r\nthe Grand Duke of Hesse, who kissed her hands, and then the Duke of\r\nConnaught. When the Queen saw him, maternal feelings overcame those of\r\nroyalty, and she embraced him fervently, and then, evidently fearing\r\nthat the last two princes might be hurt, she called them back, and\r\nkissed them too, and so all the princes, who came in order. She was\r\nespecially cordial to Prince Albert Victor, and heartily kissed Lord\r\nLorne, who had bent down, as if he did not expect it.\r\n\r\n“Meantime the Crown Princess stood by the step of the throne on the\r\nother side, and I think the most touching part of the whole was when she\r\nbent low to kiss her mother’s hand and was folded in a close embrace,\r\nand so all the daughters and the grand-daughters--such a galaxy of\r\ngraceful girls--bent to kiss the hand, and were kissed in turn.\r\n\r\n“Then the Queen went away, bowing all down the choir, and the flood of\r\nher youthful descendants ebbed after her.\r\n\r\n“I felt I scarcely cared to see the procession afterwards, but it was\r\nvery fine. How a past age is repeating itself! One sees this in\r\ncomparing the newspaper accounts of the procession yesterday with the\r\ncontemporary tracts about the entry of Queen Elizabeth, telling how ‘in\r\nall her passage she did show her most gracious love towards the people\r\nin general,’ and how the citizens, when they saw her, ‘took such\r\ncomfort, that with tears they expressed the same.’ I am one of the 400\r\nasked to meet the 100 royalties at the Foreign Office, but cannot manage\r\narranging levée dress properly in time.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_June 23, 1887._--This is a postscript to my last.\r\n\r\n“Nothing could exceed the orderliness, good-nature, and merriment of the\r\nimmense crowd at the illuminations on the evening of the Jubilee day. I\r\ntook Letitia Hibbert and her friend Miss Robertson to see the best from\r\nHyde Park, and then along the Green Park, where movement was quite easy,\r\nand the effect of the houses bathed in a halo of coloured light very\r\nbeautiful through the dark massy foliage.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday I went at 3 P.M. to Hyde Park. A dense mass of people walled\r\nin the vast enclosed space, but all in the utmost good-humour, though\r\nmany came forward with--‘Oh, do give me your ticket: oh, do now, just\r\nfor once.’ Inside the outer barrier was a second, within which people\r\nwalked, and whence they saw. I was indignant at first at not being\r\nadmitted farther, but when I saw the Archbishop of Canterbury refused,\r\nwas quite contented to share the fate of the first subject in the realm.\r\nHowever, eventually we were both passed into the immense space where the\r\nchildren were playing, not apparently the least over-done by the hot\r\nsun, or tired from having been on the move since 10 A.M., and having\r\nbeen provided, on arriving, with nothing but a bag containing a\r\nmeat-pie, a bun (they say the buns would have reached from London to\r\nBrentford in a direct line), and an orange, with instructions to put the\r\nbag in their pockets when done with! Each of the 30,000 children also\r\nhad a ‘Jubilee mug’ of Doulton ware. Every now and then volleys of tiny\r\ncoloured balloons were sent up, like flights of bright birds floating\r\naway into the soft blue, and, as the royalties arrived, a great yellow\r\nballoon, with several people in its car, bore a huge ‘Victoria’\r\nskywards.\r\n\r\n“I found my cousin Lady Normanton lost, and stayed with her and a very\r\npleasant ex-governess of Princess May, most indignant at her adored\r\npupil having received no Order out of the numbers distributed. Between\r\nhalf-past four and five life-guards heralded a long procession of\r\ncarriages, with the Indian princes, the foreign queens and kings, and\r\nour own royal family in force. A number of Eastern chieftains were\r\nriding six abreast, and very like Bluebeard one or two of them looked.\r\nFinally came the Queen, smiling, good and gracious beyond words, and\r\nwith a wonderful reception everywhere. ‘I have made Socialist speeches\r\nfor years,’ said one man, ‘and the last two days have shown me how\r\nuseless they have been, and always must be in this country.’\r\n\r\n“As the Queen passed up the green drive by which we were standing, all\r\nthe 30,000 children sang ‘God save the Queen,’ and a thanksgiving hymn,\r\nwhich I think must have been, not for their tea (for they never had\r\nany), but for hers, which I hope she enjoyed out of the great fourgons\r\nwe saw arriving, and must much have needed. All the royal ladies’-maids\r\nand other servants also passed by in carriages on their way to the\r\nstation, by the Queen’s wish, that they should share in the sight.\r\n\r\n“Having escorted Lady Normanton to the safe solitudes of Wilton Place, I\r\nrushed off to Windsor, arriving at nine. Certainly the grandeur of the\r\nLondon illuminations paled before the intense picturesqueness of those\r\nin the old royal city. I had no time to go to Eton, where the Queen had\r\nentered--like Queen Elizabeth--under an arch on the battlements of which\r\nEton boys were lustily trumpeting. But the bridge, brilliant in electric\r\nlight, also ended in an arch, kept dark itself, beyond which every house\r\nin the steep, sharply-winding street was seen adorned with its own\r\nvaried devices of coloured light, from basement to attics, whilst the\r\nwalls were hung with scarlet draperies, and brilliant banners of scarlet\r\nand gold waved across the roadway.\r\n\r\n“I stayed on the bridge to see the thousand Eton boys cross, marching in\r\ndetachments, with white and blue uniforms alternately, carrying their\r\n(then unlighted) torches, and then went after them to the castle, where\r\nI was one of the few admitted, and pushed on at once to the inner court\r\nunder the Queen’s apartments.\r\n\r\n“Most unspeakably weird, picturesque, inspiring, beautiful, and\r\nglorious was the sight, when, with a burst of drums and trumpets, the\r\nwonderful procession emerged under the old gate of Edward III., headed\r\nby a detachment of the Blues, then the boys, six abreast, carrying\r\nlighted torches, till hundreds upon hundreds had filed in, singing\r\nsplendidly ‘God save the Queen.’ All the bigger boys formed into figures\r\nof blazing light in the great court, weaving designs of light in their\r\nmarch--‘Welcome,’ ‘Victoria,’ &c., in radiant blaze of moving living\r\nillumination; whilst the little boys, each carrying a coloured Chinese\r\nlantern on a wand, ascended in winding chains of light the staircases on\r\nthe steep hill of the Round Tower opposite the Queen’s window, till the\r\nslope was covered with brilliancy and colour. The little boys sang very\r\nsweetly in the still night their song of welcome, and then all the mass\r\nof the boys below, raising their flaming torches high into the air,\r\nshouted with their whole hearts and lungs, ‘Rule Britannia!’\r\n\r\n“It was an unspeakably transporting scene, and I am sure that the\r\nbeloved figure in the white cap seated in the wide-open central window\r\nfelt it so, and was most deeply moved by the sight and sound of so much\r\nloyal and youthful chivalry.\r\n\r\n“Then, in a great hush, she almost astonished them by leaving her place\r\nand suddenly reappearing in the open air in the courtyard amongst them,\r\nand making them a queenly and tender little speech in her clear\r\nbeautiful voice--‘I do thank you so very very much,’ &c.\r\n\r\n“You may imagine the hurrahs which followed, the frantic emotion and\r\napplause whilst she called up and spoke to Lord Ampthill and one or two\r\nother boys whose parents had been especial friends.\r\n\r\n“And then, in figures of light from their torches, as she reappeared at\r\nthe window, the vast assembly formed the word ‘Good-night.’ Nothing\r\ncould possibly have been more picturesquely pretty.\r\n\r\n“Immediately afterwards the whole of the great central tower was flooded\r\nwith red light, which seemed to turn it into blood, and I went with J.\r\nDundas to the North Terrace, whence we looked down upon the\r\nfireworks--fire-fountains, comets, cascades of golden, sapphire, and\r\namethyst rain.\r\n\r\n“It was 2 A.M. when I got back to London, but well worth the fatigue.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLONDON JOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_June 23, 1887._--Sat at breakfast by Sir George Dasent. ‘Did you ever\r\nknow,’ he said, ‘the late old Bengal tiger at Asbburnham?[453] He asked\r\nme down there, and when I went he said, “You are here, sir, under false\r\npretences. I have discovered that you are a member, sir, of that most\r\ndisreputable society called the ‘Historic MSS. Commission:’ they are a\r\nsociety of ruffians, sir.”--“Surely, Lord Ashburnham, a great many\r\neminent persons are members of that society,--Lord Salisbury, for\r\ninstance, surely he is not a ruffian.”--“Yes, sir, he _is_ a ruffian\r\nwhen he is acting for that society: and you, sir, you are a ruffian\r\ntoo--you tamper with title-deeds, sir,” and it was quite in vain to\r\nassure him that our society had no interest whatever in title-deeds of\r\nthe last hundred years.\r\n\r\n“‘I told Lady Ashburnham what he said, and she answered, “You must not\r\nmind: he is the most kind-hearted of men, but he has--his savage\r\nmoments!”\r\n\r\n“‘Afterwards he was very kind to me, and showed me all his treasures,\r\nespecially his glorious Anglo-Saxon MSS.\r\n\r\n“‘When I was at Hornby, I went up with the present Duchess of Leeds into\r\na tower into which a former Duchess had carried a quantity of books,\r\nbecause, she said, “there were enough downstairs.” They had been taken\r\nup at haphazard, and some of them were of extraordinary value: there\r\nwere wonderful editions of Aretino there, excessively improper, but\r\nnobody could read them. The tower had been open to the bats and owls,\r\nand when we took out the books, many of them were matted together in one\r\nsolid mass: they bore the name of Hewit Osborne, the apprentice who\r\njumped from London Bridge to save the life of his master’s daughter,\r\nand, afterwards marrying her, founded the family; he was a great Italian\r\nscholar.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 1._--Sir G. Dasent says that the late Queen of Sweden said to him\r\nthat she could not imagine how it was that her eldest son had done all\r\nhe could to alienate the affections of his people, and was adored, and\r\nthe second all he could to conciliate them, and was detested. The eldest\r\n(the late King) was a Hercules. ‘His Majesty will rise at 3 A.M.\r\nto-morrow and will ride thirty miles (to Gripsholm), and wishes you to\r\naccompany him,’ was a frequent announcement to guests and courtiers; and\r\nwhen they reached Gripsholm, all was prepared for a great elk-hunt, and\r\nwhen _that_ was finished, and they were gasping for rest, came the\r\nannouncement, ‘His Majesty will rise at 2 A.M. to-morrow, and will ride\r\nforty miles,’ &c.\r\n\r\n“Luncheon with Lady Stradbroke, who told me that as she was walking up\r\nGrosvenor Crescent during the illuminations, a group of country people\r\nwere inspecting the devices. ‘Ah!’ she heard one of them explain, ‘V.\r\nR.--that’s for _very respectable_.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 3._--Yesterday was very hot--a hotter scirocco, said Roman Mr.\r\nStory, than any he had felt in Italy. There was a great volunteer\r\nreview, which brought the usual picturesque procession of the Queen,\r\nwith her glittering life-guards, through the Park.\r\n\r\n“On Friday I went with Florentia Hughes to a great garden-party of the\r\nBaroness Coutts at Holly Lodge--a most lovely place, with steep hilly\r\ngardens and splendid herbaceous flowers.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 6._--Yesterday I went with the Indian princes by special train to\r\nWoburn. Everything was arranged _en grand seigneur_--nothing to be paid\r\nanywhere--a train with saloon carriages, in which we floated into\r\nBedfordshire without stopping, and thirty-two carriages, beautifully\r\nequipped, sent to meet us at the station. In one of these I drove\r\nthrough the lanes lined with dog-roses with Lord Normanby and Miss\r\nGrosvenor. ‘I am always mistaken for Princess Mary, so must keep up her\r\ncharacter,’ said the latter, and bowed incessantly, right and left, to\r\nthe village crowds, who were quite delighted with her. We had a long\r\nwait before luncheon, Europe and Asia separated by a great gulf which no\r\none seemed able to bridge over. Lady Tavistock did her best, but the\r\nparty hung fire, and, though a magnificent banquet, with all the gold\r\nplate displayed, took part of the time, there was not much to animate\r\nus, and we lounged on the lawn, tried to be agreeable and were not, and\r\nadmired the beautiful Indians, with their gorgeous dresses and languid\r\neyes, till another chain of carriages took us back through the Ampthill\r\nwoods to another station.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 7._--Miss Holford was married this afternoon to Mr. Benson at St.\r\nGeorge’s before an immense crowd. There was a great breakfast\r\nafterwards--though so late--at Dorchester House, where all London\r\nflocked through the rooms to admire the presents, which were\r\nindescribably splendid. The scene on the beautiful white marble\r\nstaircase was charming, especially when the bride went away, her father\r\nand mother leading her down on either side, and all the tiny bridesmaids\r\nand pages--nieces and nephews between six and seven--gambolling in\r\nfront, with huge baskets of dark red roses. Above, under the circular\r\narches, between the pillars of coloured marbles, and against a golden\r\nwall background, the overhanging galleries were filled with all the most\r\nbeautiful women in London leaning over the balustrades.\r\n\r\n“Dined at the Speaker’s--lovely lights sparkling along the shore, and\r\nthe splash of the river and distant hum only making one feel more the\r\nsilence of night. We sat out upon the haunted terrace afterwards--such\r\nstars, and a moon rising behind the towers of Lambeth.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ LOUISA, MARCHIONESS OF WATERFORD.\r\n\r\n“_June 30._--On Saturday I went to Osterley, meeting beautiful Lady\r\nKatherine Vane[454] with her brother and sister at the Victoria Station,\r\nand going down with them. Troops of people emerged from the train close\r\nto the gate in the park wall, and we all flocked together along the\r\ngravel walks through the hot meadows to the house, where the shade was\r\nvery refreshing. Lady Jersey was receiving under the portico, and groups\r\nof Indian princes with their interpreters were busy over strawberries\r\nand cream in the corners of the great stone hall. I went, with several\r\npeople who had an equally tender remembrance of the kind old Duchess of\r\nCleveland, who lived there so long, to visit the little library where\r\nshe always sat in winter--quite deserted now, and all the books\r\nsold--and then joined the many groups of people on the lawns and the\r\ngreen glade which ends in a porticoed summer-house like a\r\nClaude-Lorraine picture. Others went in a boat upon the lake. The\r\nJerseys pressed me to stay to dinner with Lord and Lady Muncaster; so\r\nLady M. and I both got a volume of a very dull novel, over which we had\r\na pleasant rest when all the crowd were gone. Never were such airy\r\npeople as the Jerseys, a line of six windows open on one side and two\r\ndoors on the other all dinner-time. Lady Hilda Brodrick and one of Lady\r\nJersey’s brothers were my neighbours, and very pleasant.\r\n\r\n“On Sunday I had luncheon at Lord Breadalbane’s, to have a quiet sight\r\nof my Prince. It is a wonderful house--deeply coved ceilings with\r\nfrescoes like those in an old Venetian palace, and wide spaces round the\r\noutside planted with groves of plane-trees. The Breadalbanes have\r\nthought it worth while to make a new dining-room (though sacrificing two\r\nold ceilings), as they have taken all the rest of the lease, after which\r\nthe house reverts (it is Harcourt House) to the Harcourts of Nuneham.\r\nThe Duchess of Roxburgh, an Indian prince, and several other ladies\r\ndropped in, so there were three tables for luncheon. In the middle, Lady\r\nBreadalbane[455] got up and went round to each table, almost to each\r\nguest, to see that they had all they could possibly want, and to say the\r\npleasantest things to them in the prettiest way: she certainly is a\r\nqueen of hostesses. Afterwards my Prince came to me, and we walked up\r\nand down upon the terrace. He was most affectionate, as he always is\r\nwhen we meet, and talked of all people and things as if we had never\r\nparted, but reproached me much with never coming to him in Norway,\r\nurging very much that I should write at any time, or even telegraph that\r\nI was coming for any length of stay. Some day, when I am free from my\r\nFrench work, I will go. He evidently wished that I should say something\r\nto Lady Breadalbane of the great difference her excessive kindness had\r\nmade during all this visit to England, so I was very glad to do so. ‘We\r\nhave done our best,’ she said, ‘and I am very glad it has gone off so\r\nwell; but it has not been my doing, but all owing to those who have\r\nhelped me.’ The Indian had brought a suit of flannels with him in a\r\ncarpet-bag, and changed into them, and when my Prince went to get ready\r\nto play at tennis with him, I came away.\r\n\r\n“On Monday (27th) we had our large drawing-party down the river. Meeting\r\nat Westminster Bridge, we all took tickets to ‘Cherry-Tree Yard’ at\r\nRotherhithe. Just as we were going to embark, the ticket-man very\r\ngood-naturedly emerged, and coming to me said, ‘I do not know if you are\r\naware, sir, that you are taking all these ladies into a most rough and\r\ndangerous part of London.’ I said we were only going to draw at the\r\nwharf, when he was satisfied. But when we arrived, they would not let us\r\nstay on the wharf. A man said, ‘I know of a most respectable\r\npublic-house where you can go: all the artists draw from thence.’ And\r\nthere we all sat, in great shade and comfort, under a wide verandah,\r\ndirectly overhanging the river and overlooking the Pool, with all the\r\nfine shipping which comes up to that picturesque reach of the\r\nThames--‘Dutch Crawls’ inclusive.\r\n\r\n“I dined with the Eustace Cecils, meeting, amongst others, Professor and\r\nMrs. Flower, of whom the former was holding Arthur Stanley’s hand when\r\nhe died.\r\n\r\n“At a quarter to five yesterday I went to Buckingham Palace--no string,\r\nno crowd, no difficulty. By my ticket I had to enter through the hall\r\nand rooms beyond it--the most picturesque way. The terrace was already\r\nfull of people, but the space is so vast there never could be a crowd,\r\nand the scene was beautiful, looking down upon the sunlit lawns, the\r\nlake and fountain, and the thousands of gaily-dressed people--the\r\nsplendid uniforms and lustrous robes and sparkling jewels of the Indians\r\nglistening amongst them. It was impossible to find any one one looked\r\nfor, but one came upon hundreds of unexpected friends. Very few young\r\nmen seemed to have been asked, but there were galaxies of pretty girls.\r\nOne ancient Indian chief in white, with a flowing beard and a robe of\r\ncloth of gold over his shoulders, was told he might salute the Queen. He\r\nsaid he must do it after his fashion, which was to wipe the dust from\r\nher feet with his handkerchief, and then kiss it.\r\n\r\n“The beloved Queen, though very hot and tired (she had been before to\r\nrevisit her birthplace at Kensington), looked very sweet and smiling,\r\nand walked indefatigably from side to side of the long avenues of\r\npeople, shaking hands with different ladies. There was the usual\r\nprocession of princes and princesses, including the white-haired Duchess\r\nof Mecklenbourg and the ever-pretty group of Hesse princesses. The\r\nPrincess Beatrice’s baby assisted at the party in her perambulator,\r\npushed by a nurse in white. A good deal of my time was taken up by the\r\nDuchess of Cleveland insisting that she could have no refreshment but\r\nlemonade, and that being quite a quarter of a mile off; but I could not\r\nget it after all, through people ten deep in the refreshment tents. Some\r\nof the guests were rowed by the Queen’s boatmen in their gorgeous\r\nmediaeval costume upon the lake, with very pretty effect. The palace is\r\nvery handsome on the garden side.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 8, 1887._--I made rather friends at the Speaker’s with his eldest\r\nboy, Willie Peel, and walked about with him on the terrace. He is in all\r\nthe first flush of people-seeing, and thinks everybody full of\r\noriginality; yet how few ever say more than something they have heard or\r\nread long ago, and dug up out of some remote corner of their brain. He\r\nis, however, delightful, and being evidently ambitious, will some day be\r\nvery distinguished, I should think.\r\n\r\n“How often one wishes one could enter society again, with one’s past\r\nconversation like a white page, that where one could not say good of any\r\none, one had always kept silence. I sympathise with General Gordon\r\nsaying that one reason why he never desired to enter social life was the\r\nvery great difficulty of knowing people and not discussing others.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 9._--At Lambeth garden-party I sat with ----, whose marriage, an\r\nadmirable one, was quelched by worldly motives on the other side, sadly,\r\nlong ago. She spoke of the married happiness of her brilliant and\r\npopular namesake ‘Yes, life for _her_ is always delightful now; but\r\n_I_--but I!’--‘Where do you live?’--‘I don’t live, I exist.’\r\n\r\n“I sat at dinner by Lady C, a very singular religious ‘talker,’ who\r\nplunged at once into--‘I trust you are interested in the good\r\nwork.’--‘What good work?’--‘Raising the classes,’ and so on, and so on,\r\nendless well-meant nonsense, in very grand expressions, till I longed to\r\nsay to her, and did, in other words, what Madame de Sévigné said to some\r\none, ‘Thicken me your religion a little; it is evaporating altogether by\r\nbeing subtilised.’ I tried to dwell upon the really higher life (for she\r\nhad talked of her own neglected education), of teaching herself first as\r\nmuch as possible, that she might help herself to teach her young son. I\r\nsuppose that, for her, would be the higher life. How much, in this\r\ngeneration, ‘religious people’ are apt to forget John Wyckliff’s motto,\r\n‘He who liveth best, prayeth best.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sunday, July 10._--Sat in the afternoon in the garden at Lowther\r\nLodge, seeing a long diorama of people drop in and have tea.\r\n\r\n“Afterwards I ascended the great brick mansions close by to see Mrs.\r\nProcter (Barry Cornwall’s widow), who is not the least aged in mind, and\r\napparently not in body. People thought she would be broken by her\r\ndaughter’s death; but constitutions, especially of the old, seldom take\r\nany notice of heart-blows, though there is something touching in the way\r\nshe speaks of her lost daughters as ‘my Edith,’ ‘my Adelaide.’ People\r\ncall her ‘Our Lady of Bitterness,’ but her words have no touch of\r\nsharpness. No one is more agreeable still: no one has more boundless\r\nconversational powers: indeed, she often says of herself that ‘talking\r\nis meat, drink, and clothing’ to her. Her sense of humour is exquisite;\r\nshe never speaks bad grammar herself, so she can never tolerate it in\r\nothers. She wears a front of _blonde cendré_, and boldly speaks of it\r\nas a wig. Mr. Browning came in, and they were most amusing together. ‘My\r\nwife thought you would not perhaps like to meet Mr. Labouchere, Mrs.\r\nProcter?’ said Mr. Thompson of the _Pall Mall Gazette_, rather\r\ninterrogatively. ‘Your wife was quite right: had I found, on coming to\r\ndine with you, that Mr. Labouchere was expected, I should have been\r\ncompelled to ask you at once to call me a cab.’--‘Ah! Labby,\r\nLabby!--Hie, cabby, cabby!!’ cried Mr. Browning in the quaintest\r\nway.[456] Mr. Browning goes to see Mrs. Procter every Sunday afternoon,\r\ngiving up all else for it.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Procter has the almost lost art of conversation in the fullest\r\ndegree. Lord Houghton recollects how she was asked to meet Macaulay at\r\none of Rogers’ breakfasts. Afterwards she said to Rogers, ‘But where was\r\nMacaulay?’--‘Why, he sat opposite to you!’--‘Was _that_ him? Why, I\r\nalways heard he was such a tremendous talker.’--‘So he is,’ said Rogers;\r\n‘but you see I talked so much myself, I only left one opening, and that\r\n_you_ took.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 11._--Dined with the Seymour Hughes’s, where General Higginson\r\nwas full of indignation about the mismanagement of royal\r\ninvitations--that it was impossible for the Lord Chamberlain to do it\r\nalone, but that he might have a committee--three or four men of the\r\nKenneth Howard kind--who would see that the right people were asked. The\r\nPrince of Wales had said to one lady, ‘I did not see you at the\r\ngarden-party,’ and she had answered, ‘No, I was not asked; but my\r\ndressmaker was.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 15._--Dined with Mrs. Portman--a very large party. She told me\r\nthat, close to her country-house, a labourer had watched some boys\r\nbathing, and thought how delightful was the way in which they dived,\r\nfloated, &c., and, though he could not swim, he determined that, on the\r\nvery first chance, he would enjoy the same amusement. Soon after, he was\r\nsent to cut rushes with two other men. When his work was finished, he\r\nremembered his wish, and did not even wait to undress, but, pulling off\r\nhis boots, jumped into the water with his clothes on. Soon he got into\r\na hole and began to sink. He called for help, and another of the men\r\njumped in, and was sucked into the hole also, and so the third. Mr.\r\nFitzhardinge Portman came up when it was all over, and said, ‘I will\r\nride on and break it to Mrs. W.,’ the wife of one of the men. As he\r\nreached the cottage, Mrs. W. came out to meet him and said, ‘I know what\r\nyou have come to tell me, sir. Poor W. is dead.’--‘How can you know\r\nit?’--‘Why, sir, just now my little girl came running in all awestruck,\r\nand said that she had met a figure all in white in the wood-path down\r\nwhich she always ran to meet her father; and then I knew it was a\r\nwarning.’\r\n\r\n“There was a beautiful ball at Lowther Lodge--the Princess Christian\r\nthere and the garden illuminated, and looking, in that dress, as big as\r\nthe Green Park. I sat out with Lady Strathmore, full of all the\r\ndiscomforts of a great inheritance--such endless details to be filled\r\nup: such endless new responsibilities; and just what seems the wrong\r\nthings always left away.\r\n\r\n“I heard such a charming story of little Jane Smith the other day. Her\r\nnurse told her to say her prayers. She wouldn’t; she said God wouldn’t\r\nexpect her to. ‘But He always expects it,’ said the nurse. ‘No, He\r\ndoesn’t,’ replied little Jane, ‘for I told Him the other day I couldn’t\r\nsay them, I was so sleepy, and He said, ‘Don’t mention it, _Miss\r\nSmith_.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 15._--Rain on St. Swithin’s Day. Lady Lyndhurst says, ‘Do you\r\nknow that he was three times Lord Chancellor of England, and that the\r\nonly man who has filled that office three times since was my lord.’\r\n\r\n“Went to see Mrs. Ross,[457] a breeze from Castagnuolo in London. She\r\nwas full of the enchantment of a visit to Lacaita at Leucaspide, and of\r\na tour she had made to Otranto; to Lecce, where all the professors had\r\nmet to receive ‘una donna molta istruita’ at the museum, where she had\r\nnot known anything whatever of the subjects they discoursed upon, but,\r\nby judicious silence and an occasional ‘si,’ had now the highest\r\nopinions; to Manfredonia, where the inn is now kept by one Don Michele,\r\nto whom the would-be sojourners have to be formally presented, when he\r\naccepts or rejects them, with ‘mi piace’ or ‘non mi piace.’ On one of\r\nthese excursions she heard the sound of an instrument hitherto unknown\r\nto her from a hollow below the road, and going down, found a boy playing\r\non a long pipe of birch-bark. ‘Cosa è questo?’--‘Il fischio della\r\nprimavera;’ and she bought it for ten centimes--the sweetest of music\r\nand of instruments; but it only lasts a week, and can only be obtained\r\nwith the spring.\r\n\r\n“Afterwards I sat with Miss Seymour, who talked of the political state\r\nof France, and of Kisseloff saying, ‘Ils se croient toujours malades\r\nquand ils n’ont pas la fièvre.’\r\n\r\n“Then to Mrs. Liddell (of Christ-Church). Princess Christian had just\r\nbeen there for a committee for women’s work. Mrs. Liddell said she went\r\nabout immensely amongst the poor of Windsor, and had a district. Once,\r\nwhen she went for a month to Berlin, she said to one of her poor women\r\nthat she was going away, but that she would be well looked after, as she\r\nhad got some one to take her place. ‘Yes, but it will not be the same to\r\nme; for I shall have no one to tell my troubles to.’\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Liddell had some capital oil-portraits. She asked who I thought\r\nthey were by. I supposed by young Richmond. ‘No; by my daughter\r\nViolet.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 16._--Luncheon with Lady Knightley and then to Osterley--a soft\r\nwarm day; the flowers, from the long drought, quite magnificent under\r\nthe dark cedars by the lake.\r\n\r\n    ‘Look how the roses\r\n     Hold up their noses,’\r\n\r\nsaid old Lord Ebury, with whom I walked about, and who begged Miss\r\nGrosvenor not to leave him till she had found him an _innamorata_; which\r\nshe eventually did in the person of Lady Balfour of Burleigh, very\r\npretty in her attentions to the old man. Then the Duchess of\r\nMecklenbourg came, and also sat under the trees. Lady Wynford brought\r\nMr. Graham Vivian and me home, and I went to a Cinderella ball at Lady\r\nGuinness’s--quite splendid; and though it began at ten and ended at\r\ntwelve, very crowded and successful, showing that the introduction of an\r\nearlier hour for balls would be perfectly easy.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 17._--Met Mr. Reeve, the editor of the _Quarterly_. Mr. Tedder\r\nreminded me of Mark Pattison’s speaking (in the _Academy_) of ‘those old\r\nthree-deckers--the _Edinburgh_ and the _Quarterly_; the latter of which\r\nsets to sea under the guidance, apparently, of the Ancient Mariner.’\r\n\r\n“I had luncheon yesterday with Mrs. Cyril Flower, the most amusingly\r\ndecided of women, and met young Lady Wenlock, pining to return to India,\r\nwhere she enjoyed so much the languid life, or rather, as she called it,\r\nthe time for thought which the heat gave her.\r\n\r\n“A most pleasant dinner at Charlie Balfour’s, meeting a group of real\r\nfriends--Guy Sebright and his nice wife, Basil Levett and his sweet Lady\r\nMargaret, and Sir John Maxwell, who is most simple, clever, and\r\npleasant,--delightful to be with. Minnie Balfour was full of Mrs.\r\nSlingsby, whose curious old house in Yorkshire is so strangely haunted.\r\nOne hot night, very late, when her husband was away, Mrs. Slingsby sat\r\nout on the terrace, and below her, in the park, saw the most brilliant\r\nlight apparently burning on the grass. She went down to it, reached it,\r\nand it disappeared. Exactly that day year, she watched for it and saw it\r\nagain. That time she went behind it, and saw it between herself and the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n“Lady Heathcote Amaury, whom I took down to dinner, said, ‘You know\r\nyoung Lady Onslow was a daughter of Lord Gardner. She told me that her\r\nfather rented a place called Chilton from Colonel ----. When he took it,\r\nColonel ---- said, “As you are taking the place for some time, I think\r\nperhaps it is my duty to tell you that the state bedroom is haunted. A\r\nyoung ancestor of mine, dressed in a blue coat and breeches, with a\r\nrose in his button-hole, comes in, arranges his hair at the mirror,\r\nlooks at the occupant of the room, throws up the window, and vanishes\r\nthrough it. He does nobody any harm, and is excessively\r\npleasant-looking, still I ought not to let you take the place without\r\ntelling you.”\r\n\r\n“‘Lord Gardner said he did not care a bit; but the state bedroom had\r\nvery remarkable furniture,--a magnificent bed with curtains looped up by\r\ngilt cherubs, and, after Lady Gardner heard the story, she got leave to\r\nchange the furniture, and the old hangings were carefully put away, and\r\nmodern furniture used instead.\r\n\r\n“‘Soon after some cousins of Lord Gardner, two ladies belonging to the\r\nelder branch of the family, came from Scotland to stay, and were put\r\ninto that room. When they came down next morning, Lord Gardner asked the\r\nelder if she had rested well after her journey. She answered, “Yes,\r\nindeed, and I have had the most delightful dream: I dreamt that the room\r\nI was in was furnished in the most beautiful way, with gilt cupids,\r\nhangings, &c.,--and really what I dreamt was so charming that I longed\r\nfor you some time to be able to furnish the room just in that way. And\r\nthen--I seemed to be awake, but of course I could not have been--I saw a\r\nyoung man of most beautiful countenance come into the room, dressed in a\r\nblue coat, &c., which was quite in keeping with the room, and he went up\r\nto the glass and arranged his hair, then he looked at me with a charming\r\nexpression upon his face, but just when he seemed going to speak, and I\r\nwas longing to know what he would say, he threw open the window, and\r\ndisappeared through it.”\r\n\r\n“‘Lady Onslow said, “You may imagine the breathless interest with which\r\nwe listened.”’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 17._--Supper at the Miss Hollands’. Met Mr. Turner, rather a\r\nremarkable American. The sight of white roses made him say, ‘A white\r\nrose comes home to me, Miss Holland, and I will tell you why. Many years\r\nago, in Philadelphia, I met a party of cousins, and we all spent the\r\nevening together. A young cousin of mine--very pretty--was there, who\r\nwas lately married, and I was very glad to see her, and we talked much\r\ntogether--so much together all evening that it was a matter of\r\ncomment--of foolish comment. When we parted, she gave me a white rose,\r\nand she said, “You must keep that rose as long as we live.” I took the\r\nrose home and pressed it. From time to time I heard from her afterwards,\r\nbut I never saw her, and I forgot the rose. Long afterwards I was in\r\nPhiladelphia again, and in the evening, opening a book, something fell\r\nout on the floor: it was the white rose. I felt it an omen, and I said\r\nto myself, “It is long since I heard of her; something has happened. I\r\nwill just go round to Uncle Joe’s and inquire.” I went, and found that\r\nUncle Joe knew nothing; but whilst I was there the news arrived that she\r\nwas dead.\r\n\r\n“‘The white rose, when it fell, had told me that already.\r\n\r\n“‘I believe in such things. I possess a looking-glass that I have long\r\nhad in my keeping. One day, there seemed no reason why, I saw it slide\r\nfrom the table: it fell. The corner was broken off. I had it mended.\r\nAlmost immediately a cable was brought in announcing the death of a near\r\nrelation. Some time after it fell again. The other corner was broken\r\noff. I said, “What is going to happen now?” The next day I heard of the\r\ndeaths of three intimate friends. So I said, “It will never do to go on\r\nlike this,” and I had the glass sawn down, and so framed and padded with\r\nindia-rubber at the back, that, if it fell, it was scarcely possible it\r\ncould be broken. Well, that--stopped it.’\r\n\r\n“Mr. Turner gave a very curious account of the early state of many\r\nAmerican settlements--that the rivers or any running stream generally\r\nmarked the track for civilisation. It was easier to make a path along\r\nthem than anywhere else; a road followed, eventually a railway. Along\r\none of these tracks, many years ago, came annually a venerable old man.\r\nPeople expected him--watched for his coming. He always came from the\r\neast, and he was never observed to return: yet he came again from the\r\neast in the following year. He was a kind of primitive missionary,\r\nbringing Bibles, which he cut up, leaving parts in the different houses\r\nhe passed. Thus he would leave the Gospel of St. John one year, and the\r\nnext would call for it, and leave the Acts in its place. He had a\r\npocket-full of apple-seed, and wherever he stopped in the middle of the\r\nday, he made a hole with his stick, and dropped one of his seeds into\r\nit. People called him ‘Old John Apple-seed.’ Mr. Turner had seen many\r\nfine apple-trees along the banks of streams, of which it was remembered\r\nthat they were planted by old John Apple-seed.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Turner described how primitive many of the early lines of railway\r\nwere, made at the rate of three miles a week. At Harrisburg several of\r\nthese lines met, and it was a very dangerous point. A poor half-witted\r\nman found his vocation in life by joining trains at this point, and\r\nrunning in front screaming, ‘The engine is coming: the engine is\r\ncoming.’ And thus he would run for miles, keeping just in front of the\r\ntrain, and if he saw a child, would seize it and throw it out of the\r\nway, and would often seize a woman by the shoulder, and would almost\r\nlift her off the line; but at last, after many years, whilst saving\r\nanother, he was killed himself.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 18._--A party at Lady Bantry’s, where Lady Helen Stewart recited\r\na poem much like the above story. Dined with the Grants. Old Lady\r\nFrances Higginson[458] frightened a mincing curate out of his life who\r\nsaid to her, ‘Will you _take_ some potatoes?’ by saying in her most\r\nabrupt way, ‘God bless my soul, aren’t you going to _give_ me some?’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 20._--At luncheon at the Higginsons’, I met the Storys from Rome,\r\nvery happy in London, but ‘it is surely a bad arrangement of Nature,’ he\r\nsaid, ‘that one should have so many coats and only one body. I should\r\nlike to have several--a body to work with; and a young smart body to go\r\ninto society with; and the old body, which always sleeps so well, to go\r\nto bed with.’\r\n\r\n“At luncheon at Lady Airlie’s I met Henry Cowper,[459] Mr. Morley, Lady\r\nTweeddale, and Miss Betty Ponsonby. Henry Cowper talked of the\r\nfriendship between Bright and Tuke. They had always been intimate. Then\r\nthey loved the same woman. In his great friendship Tuke gave way, and\r\nthe lady became the first Mrs. John Bright. Afterwards they were greater\r\nfriends, and saw more of each other than ever: Bright would do anything\r\nfor Tuke. But the conversation was chiefly about Gladstone, giving\r\ninstances of his marvellous personal charm--of his way of telling\r\nthings, bearing out Goethe’s words--\r\n\r\n    ‘Märchen! doch so wunderbar,\r\n     Dichterkünster machen’s wahr.’\r\n\r\n“Tea with Mrs. Ford--always interesting. She talked much of Dr. Morell\r\nMackenzie--well known to her. When he arrived at Berlin, he found six\r\ngreat doctors waiting for him at the palace. They took him to a room\r\nfilled with knives, &c. ‘What are these for?’--‘For your choice in\r\noperating upon the Crown Prince.’--‘But I can only operate upon him in\r\none way, that is my own;’ and he explained it. Four of the doctors\r\nagreed with what he said, two violently opposed it. He was taken at once\r\nto Bismarck, who said, ‘Do not consult me: ask me as many questions as\r\nyou like about _la haute politique_, but about this I can say nothing.’\r\nThen he was taken to the Emperor, to whom he explained his views. The\r\nEmperor listened to all, and then only said quietly--turning to those\r\nwho were with him--‘Let the Englishman act.’ He then went at once to the\r\nCrown Prince. He performed the operation with his own forceps, steeped\r\nin cocotine, which deadens, absolutely paralyses the throat, and seizing\r\nthe wart, dragged--not cut--it out. It seemed like a terrible\r\nresponsibility for England, as if the life of the Crown Prince was in\r\nits hands.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Browning described how he had been asked to dinner by two elderly\r\nladies--sisters. He did not know them, but it was very kind of them to\r\nask him, and he went. He met a very singular party at their\r\nhouse--Gladstone, Mrs. Thistlethwayte, and others. Going down to dinner,\r\nthe lady who fell to his share suddenly said to him, ‘You are a poet,\r\naren’t you?’--‘Well, people are sometimes kind enough to say that I\r\nam.’--‘Oh, don’t mind my having mentioned it: you know _Lord Byron was a\r\npoet_!’\r\n\r\n“Browning is unlike Tennyson; he does not write from inspiration, but by\r\npower of work. He says he sets himself a certain number of lines to\r\nwrite in a day, and he writes them. Sometimes he says, ‘To-morrow\r\nmorning I will write a sonnet; and he writes it. Nevertheless he is\r\nalways greater in aspiration than achievement. Mr. Carlyle could not\r\nbear his poems. ‘What did the fellow mean by leaving that cart-load of\r\nstones at my door?’ he said to Alfred Tennyson when Browning left one of\r\nhis poems there.\r\n\r\n“London is now always asking itself ‘What is the cause of this long\r\ndrought?’--‘Because we have had fifty years’ rain (reign).’\r\n\r\n“Went to the Halifax’s in the evening to meet the Indian princes, and\r\nthen to Lady Lamington’s party, made exceedingly pretty by its arcaded\r\ngarden on the roof.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Langleybury, August 2._--I am staying with Harry Loyd, who at\r\ntwenty-six is certainly as near perfection as any one can possibly be in\r\nevery relation of life--son, brother, friend, landlord, county magnate.\r\nHis mother and four sisters live with him, and their hospitalities are\r\nboundless.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_August 28._--Little Holmhurst has been full of summer guests--gentle\r\nLady Donoughmore and Lady Margaret Hamilton, Lady Airlie and Lady\r\nGriselda Ogilvie, Basil Levett and his Lady Margaret, Lady Sherborne,\r\nand lastly George Jolliffe and Lady Bloomfield, the latter a constant\r\nripple of interesting anecdote.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Tatton Park, Sept. 2, 1887._--The large party in this large pleasant\r\nhospitable house has included the Archbishop of Canterbury and Mrs.\r\nBenson, with their daughter--the ‘modest philosopher,’ as Miss Egerton\r\naptly calls her. We have been to Manchester to see the exhibition of all\r\nthe works of artists of Victoria’s reign--a very fine collection, from\r\nthe vapid works of Etty and the hard commonplaceness of the earlier\r\nLandseers to the noble ‘Christ or Diana’ of Long, which struck most of\r\nus as the grandest and most expressive work amongst such multitudes.\r\nThere is a curious contrast between the last and this Lady Egerton, who\r\ncannot enjoy life enough herself, or contribute enough to making it\r\nenjoyable for others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GARDEN, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n“We have just been across the park to the old Hall, where a fine timber\r\nroof remains, very richly carved; and we have driven to Tabley and its\r\nold isleted hall in the lake, so mysteriously beautiful, which the\r\nfamily abandoned two hundred and fifty years ago, leaving all its\r\ncontents in the deserted house, so that you still see the open spinnet\r\nwith the mouldering keys, the lace half worked on the cushion, the\r\nflax half spun on the distaff in the little low rooms, with their carved\r\nfurniture and fireplaces, opening, in two stories, around the great\r\ntimbered hall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RAVENNA PINE, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n“Raglan Somerset is here, unspeakably funny, so _décousu_ in his\r\nconversation, which never stops for an instant. I like also Lord and\r\nLady Rayleigh: he is learned, but perfectly simple, and she, _née_\r\nBalfour, is thoroughly pleasant and unsophisticated. Miss Mary Egerton,\r\nvery handsome, with her grey hair and youthful animated countenance, is\r\na delightful addition to the party. But the great, the real pleasure to\r\nme, has been finding Derek Keppel (Lord Bury’s second son and\r\nbrother-in-law of the only daughter of the house) almost domesticated\r\nhere: I like him so very much, certainly better than any one I know in\r\nthe same degree. It is Sunday, and we have been to the new church at\r\nAston, built by Lord and Lady Egerton without an architect, and so\r\npleasant to look upon inside that an old man said, ‘Why, sir, one can be\r\ncheerful in it, even when one is saying one’s prayers.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Woodlands, Glassbury, Sept. 7._--I came here through the lovely Church\r\nStretton country, stopping at picturesque Shrewsbury on the way to stay\r\nwith the Bishop of Lichfield and Augusta. Yesterday we went by rail\r\nthrough the beautiful but drippingly wet valleys to visit the Venables\r\nnear Builth. Our host was the well-known and severe critic in the\r\n_Saturday_--a pleasant old man to visitors, but evidently awful to the\r\nyounger members of his family.\r\n\r\n“Augusta had many interesting reminiscences of Lord Beaconsfield. One\r\nday, at luncheon, she offered him the mustard. ‘I never take mustard,’\r\nhe replied in his sepulchral voice. ‘Oh, don’t you?’ she said airily.\r\n‘No,’ he continued in solemnest tones. ‘There are three things I have\r\nnever used: I have never touched mustard; I have never had a watch; and\r\nI have never made use of an umbrella.’--‘Well,’ said Augusta, ‘I can\r\nunderstand the mustard--that is a mere matter of taste; but surely going\r\nwithout the other things must have been sometimes rather\r\ninconvenient.’--‘And why should I want them?’ continued Disraeli more\r\nsepulchrally than ever. ‘I live under the shadow of Big Ben, and there\r\nis a clock in every room of the House of Commons, so that I cannot\r\npossibly require a watch; and as I always go about in a close carriage,\r\nI can never want an umbrella.’ Disraeli was always full of these small\r\naffectations.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Woodlands, Sept. 8._--This is a charming visit, and the place is\r\ndelightful--close to the glistening Wye, with green hills--‘mountains’\r\nin Welsh--folding around, exquisite in the soft haze of early morning.\r\n\r\n“Augusta has been giving an interesting account of Champlatreux in\r\nFrance, belonging to the Duc d’Ayen, a representative of the De Noailles\r\nfamily. In the château is preserved the precious volume of the\r\n‘Imitation of Christ,’ which the young Duchesse de Noailles used in the\r\nprison of the Luxembourg, where she devoted herself to keeping up the\r\ncourage of her mother-in-law and daughter. When the three generations of\r\nthe House of Noailles were summoned together to the scaffold, the\r\nDuchesse was reading aloud to her fellow-prisoners from the chapter of\r\nthe ‘Chemin de la Croix.’ She turned down the page at that point and\r\ngave the book to one of her companions in prison, begging her, if she\r\never escaped, to convey it, as a memorial, to the De Noailles family.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sept. 10._--Two pleasant days with Graham Loyd in his charming cottage\r\nat Sketty near Swansea, and a great cementing of friendship with him.\r\nThe first day he took me by a terrible path overhanging an unprotected\r\nchasm opposite the Mumbles. All the population of Swansea seem to pour\r\nout to drink in the neighbourhood of the Mumbles. ‘You want to close the\r\npublic-houses at Swansea, that men may get drunk at the Mumbles,’ said\r\nJudge Bradwin, in opposing the Sunday-closing movement. At the same time\r\nhe said that he did not see any more reason why men should call beer a\r\n‘pernicious liquor’ than that they should call water a ‘drowning fluid.’\r\n\r\n“We have been to luncheon at Clyne, where Graham Vivian has an unkempt\r\nbut beautiful place, full of fine Italian treasures, and have dined at\r\nSingleton with Lady Hussey Vivian.[460] Besides this, we have had a\r\nwonderful drive, by heath, sandhill, and precipice, through the strange\r\ndistrict of Gower, where all the houses are whitewashed, and where there\r\nare constant wrecks on the rock-girt coast, though a great bell tolls\r\neerily through the night on a sandbank, with the waves for its ringers.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sept. 12._--Two days at the Deanery at Llandaff, where family\r\nfurniture and pictures--familiar from Alderley, Norwich, Canterbury,\r\nOxford days--give a homelike aspect.\r\n\r\n“Kate said that when she was in Madeira last year, a Mr. Husband, a\r\ndentist from Hull, was staying in the same hotel. She had heard that he\r\nhad seen a ghost there, and she asked him about it. It was only on being\r\nvery much pressed that he told how that one night, when he was in his\r\nbed in the hotel, a young man in lawn-tennis dress came in, stood at the\r\nfoot of the bed, and pointed with his finger at the pillow. Mr. H. was\r\nnot frightened, only annoyed, and asked the young man what he wanted. He\r\ndid not speak, and continued to point at the pillow. At last Mr. Husband\r\nwas so irritated that he said, ‘Well, if you will neither speak nor go\r\naway, take that,’ and dealt him a blow, but his hand only seemed to sink\r\ninto cold icy vapour, and the apparition vanished.\r\n\r\n“Next day Mr. Husband told the landlord of the hotel what had happened,\r\nwhen he said, ‘Your story is very extraordinary, because a young man,\r\nwho was staying here for some time, and was treated by a doctor for a\r\nvery slight ailment, died in that bed under very suspicious\r\ncircumstances; and, as long as he was about, that young man was never\r\nseen out of lawn-tennis dress.’\r\n\r\n“Afterwards Mr. Husband heard of that young Mr. Hyndeman from other\r\npeople in Madeira. They remembered him perfectly. He was very silent and\r\nshunned all society, and he was never out of lawn-tennis dress.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sept. 16._--A happy visit at cheerful merry Hardwick, which unites\r\nthe charms of an interesting house, of exquisite gardens, and most\r\nvaried and amusing society. There is a curious picture there of\r\nElizabeth Drury reclining on her side with her hand under her head,\r\nwhich perhaps led to the story that she died of a box on the ear. She\r\nwas a great friend of Wotton and of Donne, who wrote verses to her, and\r\nalso her epitaph.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sept. 19._--A visit to the Ordes at Hopton, in the flat marshy country\r\nnear Yarmouth--a happy united family, with a very beautiful eldest\r\ndaughter, Evelyn. Hopton village is the Blunderstone of ‘David\r\nCopperfield.’ Charlie Orde took me to Caister, the grandest fragment of\r\na castle I ever saw--so very lofty a tower rising abruptly from the edge\r\nof a very wide moat. On Sunday we saw the great low-lying lake of\r\nFlitton, which belongs to one of the Buxtons.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Sept. 22._--On Monday I went to Sculthorpe, near Fakenham, where I saw\r\nthe site of the old manor-house, part of the property which came to\r\nBishop Hare through his marriage with Mary-Margaret Alston. It has the\r\nodd name of Hos Tendis. Only the foundation-walls exist now, with\r\nremains of the moat, overhung with old apple-trees. The church is a very\r\nfine one, and the existing manor-house, Cranmer, is an exceedingly\r\nhandsome, pleasant house inside. Sir Laurence Jones, who lives there,\r\nhad brought out quantities of old Hare and Alston deeds to show me: it\r\nwas odd to see them there, but they had been sold with the property.\r\n\r\n“My kind host, the Rector, Herbert Jones, the squire’s uncle, was the\r\npicture of old-fashioned courtesy. His wife, a Gurney, sister of Mrs.\r\nOrde at Hopton, is well known for her archaeological writings. They took\r\nme, with their niece Miss Laura Troubridge and her betrothed, Adrian\r\nHope, to the beautiful old brick and terra-cotta house of Wolterton,\r\nwith a very fine gateway.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday we went to Houghton, in a well-timbered park--a house full of\r\nstately magnificence. The present Lord Cholmondeley has sold many of its\r\ntreasures, but, though much has been taken away, it is especially\r\ninteresting because nothing has been added since the time of Sir Robert\r\nWalpole. George, Lord Walpole, destroyed the grand staircase of the\r\nhouse, so that you now have to enter through the basement, instead of in\r\nstate by the grand hall on the first floor, where Sir Robert and his\r\ncompanions used to carouse, and where the chairs which they used still\r\nremain, with the rings in the ceiling which supported the scales for\r\nweighing deer. The pictures are interesting--Sir Robert over and over\r\nagain, with his beloved first wife, Catherine Shorter, and his inferior\r\nsecond wife Maria Skerret; his daughter and heiress, who brought the\r\nplace to the Cholmondeleys; and his sister Dorothy, who still walks as a\r\nghost at Rainham, where she was the wife of Lord Townshend, who is said\r\nto have walled her up in a spot where bones have been found, supposed to\r\nbe hers.\r\n\r\n“In one of the drawing-rooms is a glorious picture of the Duchess of\r\nAncaster, who was sent to bring Princess Charlotte of\r\nMecklenbourg-Strelitz to England when she came to marry George III.\r\n‘Pug, pug, pug!’ cried the people when they saw her appearance as she\r\nwas entering London. ‘Vat is dat they do say--poog?’ said the Princess,\r\n‘vat means poog?’--‘Oh, that means, God bless your Majesty,’ promptly\r\nreplied the Duchess, without the slightest hesitation. The pictures\r\nwhich are not portraits are wretched, chiefly bad copies.\r\n\r\n“In the grounds is the little garden of Catherine, Lady Walpole, which\r\nin her time was surrounded by a yew hedge. Now the yews have grown into\r\ntall trees and are interweaving overhead above the little grassy circle.\r\n\r\n“I came last night to the Locker-Lampsons at Cromer, finding Julia, Lady\r\nJersey, Brandling, Lady Kathleen Bligh, and Rollo Russell here. To-day\r\nwe have been to Blickling, where we found Lady Lothian and Lady Pembroke\r\nwalking in the radiantly beautiful garden of the grand old house. Lady\r\nLothian showed it all delightfully--the staircase, with its carved\r\nfigures on the banisters; the tapestried rooms; the long library with a\r\nvery rich ceiling, the room itself in exquisite harmony with its ranges\r\nof wonderful old books. At tea in the dining-room Baroness Coutts\r\nappeared, and many other unexpected persons dropped in.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Salisbury, Sept. 28._--A very delightful visit to Canon Douglas\r\nGordon[461] and Lady Ellen, full of old-fashioned peculiarities and\r\nbrimming over with real excellence. One son, George, is at home, a\r\nsuccessful young architect, and two daughters, of whom the eldest is a\r\ngood artist. The Canon is interesting in his recollections--amongst many\r\nothers, of the Queen Dowager, whom, as Rector of Stanmore, he saw\r\nconstantly; and a portrait of her with the last words she ever wrote\r\nbeneath it--her gift to him--hangs over the drawing-room chimney-piece.\r\nNear it is a very old oil-picture of Balmoral, interesting because the\r\nsight of that picture first decided the Queen to buy the place, which\r\nshe had not then visited: it also shows how exactly her large modern\r\nhouse follows the main lines of the old Scotch castle.\r\n\r\n“Canon Gordon says that instantly after the Queen Dowager’s death, when\r\nthey were all in tears, and all the servants were waiting in the hall\r\nfor the last news of their mistress, they were startled by a tremendous\r\nknocking at the door and a trumpet blowing, and three men entered with\r\nthe announcement, ‘We are the royal embalmers, and we are come to\r\nperform our duty!’ They had actually been waiting outside--waiting for\r\nthe first announcement of the death. In this case, however, they were\r\nsent away, as Queen Adelaide had left especial orders that her body was\r\nnot to be embalmed.\r\n\r\n“In the Canonry garden here is a fine mulberry-tree. The _only_ fact\r\nremembered about the old Canon who planted it is that whilst it was\r\nbeing placed in the ground the cathedral bell rang for service, and the\r\ngardener said, ‘You’ll be late for church, sir: the bell is ringing.’ To\r\nwhich the Canon rejoined, ‘Church be d--d; but I’ll see this mulberry\r\nplanted.’ A lesson to be careful of what one says.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday I went to Wilton in the pony-carriage with Miss Gordon, who\r\nleft me there. Lady Pembroke[462] soon came in in her riding-habit, and\r\ntook me at once through the beautiful brilliant gardens ending in the\r\nold building still called ‘Holbein’s Porch,’ though it is now far away\r\nfrom the house to which it once belonged. Then we walked on the sunny\r\nlawns swept by the massy branches of grand old cedars and intersected by\r\nthree rivers, over one of which is a beautiful Palladian bridge like\r\nthat at Prior Park.\r\n\r\n“Somehow Lady Pembroke is a person with whom one begins to talk\r\nintimately very soon, and her own conversation is most original and\r\ndelightful. But she spoke much of her wish that religion was ‘not so\r\nvery odd,’--of her intense craving to know something, _anything_\r\ntangible, about a future state. She had been seeing the Roman Mr. Story\r\nlately, who has been much amongst spiritualists, had heard speaking\r\nspirits, and had the very utmost faith in them. The spirits all\r\nconfirmed faith in a future state. Once a bad spirit came; its language\r\nwas perfectly horrible: in life it had been a pirate!\r\n\r\n“Returning to the house, we saw the Vandykes, which are most glorious.\r\nThere is a very curious contemporary picture of the coronation of\r\nRichard II. in the presence of his patron saints and of the heavenly\r\nhost. Lady Pembroke talked on and on, and when I got up to go, kept me:\r\nbut it was most interesting, and I would willingly have listened for\r\nmany hours more. Eventually she went with me to the end of the grounds,\r\nand let me out at a postern-gate in the wall.\r\n\r\n“To-day we have been to tea with the Pigott family, who live in George\r\nHerbert’s rectory (which he built) at Bemerton. It is a lovely spot,\r\nwith the little church (vulgarised inside by glazed tiles), beneath the\r\naltar of which he is believed to rest. The garden reaches to the clear\r\nrushing Madder, full of trout and grayling, and has a beautiful view of\r\nthe cathedral across the water-meadows. We saw the register with the\r\nnotice of the burial of ‘Mr. George Herbert, Esquire, parson of this\r\nplace,’[463] and his old study with its very thick walls: but he was\r\nonly at Bemerton two years, leading a life ‘little less than sainted,\r\nthough not exempt from passion and choler,’ as his brother, Lord Herbert\r\nof Cherbury, tells us in his memoirs. Americans come in crowds to see\r\nthe place, and can often repeat half his poems. Mr. Pigott asked one of\r\nthem to spend the night there, and in the morning inquired how he had\r\nslept. ‘Sleep,’ he said, ‘do you suppose I could sleep in George\r\nHerbert’s house? Why, I sat up all night thinking of him.’”[464]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 2._--Again at Highcliffe with Lady Waterford, whose conversation\r\nis as charming as ever.\r\n\r\n    ‘And thy eternal summer shall not fade,’\r\n\r\nis a line of Shakspeare which seems ever to apply to her. Here are some\r\nfragments from her lips:--\r\n\r\n“‘That is like the priest who, when he was remonstrated with for eating\r\nmeat on Friday, said, “All flesh is grass.”\r\n\r\n“‘When I was young, I delighted in Tittenhanger.[465] We used to post\r\ndown from London--a most delightful drive then. I thought it all\r\ncharming--the old house, and a wood with bluebells, and the Colne, a\r\nmere dull sluggish stream, I suppose, but it had frogs and bulrushes,\r\nand I found it enchanting. A few years ago I thought I would post down\r\nto Tittenhanger in the old way, but it was a street all the way to\r\nBarnet, and when the people saw the white horses and postillion in blue,\r\nthey came crowding round; for, though it was only my little maid\r\nBoardman and me, they thought, “Now we shall see them: now we shall see\r\nthe newly-married pair.”\r\n\r\n“The Duc d’Aumale is married. He married Mademoiselle Clinchamps, who\r\nwas lady-in-waiting to the Princess of Salerno, the Duchesse d’Aumale’s\r\nmother. She does the honours of his house, but it is a sort of\r\nmorganatic marriage.... Madame Adelaide was married too to one of the\r\ngenerals.... I remember the Aumales riding through the green avenues\r\nnear Ossington; Mary Boyle was with them. She was a most excellent\r\nhorsewoman, but a great gust of wind came, and the whole edifice of her\r\nchignon was blown off before she could stop it. The little Prince de\r\nCondé was very young then, and he was riding with her. He picked it up\r\nand said, “I will keep it in my pocket, and then, when we reach\r\nThoresby, you can go away quietly and get it put on;” and so she did.\r\nThat young Condé used to say, “I am not _le grand Condé_; I am _le petit\r\nCondé_.” ... Madame de Genlis used to write to Louis Philippe--“Sire et\r\ncher enfant.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MANOR WALK, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n“‘That Lord Shrewsbury[466] you were speaking of received Henri V. at\r\nAlton Towers--received him as king of France, and dressed up all the\r\npeople of the different lodges to represent the different nations of\r\nEurope giving him welcome. It was he who made the beautiful gardens.\r\nThere is a bust of him there, and inscribed beneath it--“He made the\r\ndesert to smile.” “And I don’t wonder at it,” said Lady Marian (Alford)\r\nwhen she saw the bust: he was so comically hideous.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhilst I was away on my visits, I had left my dear old cousin Charlotte\r\nLeycester provided with companions at Holmhurst during the annual summer\r\nvisit of several months, which had never failed since my mother’s death.\r\nI felt that thus my mother’s home, thus her own especial room, were\r\nfulfilling what she would most have wished for them. And (though, unlike\r\nmy gentle mother, Calvinistic, vehement, with a habit of constantly\r\n“improving the occasion,” and utterly intolerant still of all that did\r\nnot agree with her in religious matters), the beloved and beautiful old\r\ncousin, at nearly ninety, was this year more than ever occupied by plans\r\nand thoughts for the good of all around her, more full of spiritual\r\nmeditation herself, lifting her own heart and mind into celestial\r\ndwelling-places. For her truly one might say, “The poetry of earth is\r\nnever dead,” and I often found that I knew little of the natural charms\r\nof my own little home till she had shown them. “Speak to the earth and\r\nit shall teach thee” is a verse of Job for which she had a constant\r\napplication, and the shrubs and flowers--at Holmhurst always planted in\r\nthe same places--were intimate and familiar friends to her--\r\n\r\n        “Still within this life,\r\n    Though lifted o’er its strife.”[467]\r\n\r\nSunday was always her great delight--a Sunday to be dealt with as John\r\nKnox would have used it, and a church service freed from anything of\r\nritual, but with an extempore preacher if possible. She felt, “I always\r\nlike my victuals hot when I can get them,” as an old woman said in\r\nreference to her preacher. Latterly, however, Charlotte Leycester was\r\nscarcely able to hear sermons, though, as she wrote to me during my last\r\nabsence,--“I always _enjoy_ the sermon, though I do not hear it; for, as\r\nour old friend George Herbert says, ‘God takes a text, and preaches\r\npatience,’ and I can generally catch all texts quoted, which helps me to\r\nfollow the drift, like finding one stone after another in crossing a\r\ncurrent.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROSNY.][468]\r\n\r\nWhen turned to her reminiscences of the past, her conversation was often\r\nvery interesting. I remember her telling me this summer of her visit to\r\nParis in 1827, and going to the Royal Chapel, into which came the king,\r\nLouis XVIII., and the Duchess d’Angoulême with full evening dress in the\r\nmorning and feathers on her head. When the king entered, a great picture\r\nof our Lord hung opposite where he was to sit, to which the master of\r\nthe ceremonies seemed to introduce him--“Le roi.” “At Rosny, a beautiful\r\nold château with chestnut avenues, to which we drove out one October\r\nevening after dining at Mantes, we saw the Duchesse de Berri. Most\r\namusing the travelling then was, with the postillions in blue and in\r\ngreat jack-boots, into which they had to be lifted, with the blowing of\r\ntheir horns at every village we passed through.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few days after I reached home, two more volumes of mine were\r\npublished, “Paris” and “Days near Paris.” They had been the engrossing\r\nwork of the last two years. My hourly thought had been for them, and I\r\nhad taken all the pains I could with them. I knew their faults, and know\r\nthem still; but all the same I am conscious, and I am sure it is not\r\nconceit, that no better general books on those subjects have ever been\r\nwritten,--certainly in French there is nothing of the kind. I suppose it\r\nis one of the penalties of a lonely life, of having no near belongings,\r\nthat it seemed--perhaps a little bathos as regarded the subjects which\r\nhad filled one’s life--that no one spoke of them; that day after day\r\npassed on, and no one ever mentioned their existence. And then came a\r\nReview--a leading article indeed--in the _Athenæum_, not of mere abuse\r\nof the books, though no words were strong enough for that, but of such\r\nbitter personal malignity against myself, as gave one the shuddering\r\nconviction that one must indeed have an enemy as virulent as he was\r\nunscrupulous. “Turn author,” says Gray, “and straightway you expose\r\nyourself to pit, boxes, and gallery: any coxcomb in the world may come\r\nin and hiss if he pleases; ay, and what is almost as bad, clap too, and\r\nyou cannot hinder him.” Most of the Reviews of my books have been\r\nunfavourable, but the books have always contrived to outlive them; and\r\ngenerally, when they have been found fault with, I have felt almost\r\ngrateful for such lessons of humility, and have longed to say with\r\nGoethe, “Pray continue to make me acquainted with my own work.” Even\r\nhonest reviewers, however, seldom read beyond the first chapter of a\r\nbook; _that_ they usually read, and occasionally criticise; but even\r\nthen the tendency to save themselves trouble generally causes a great\r\ndeal of copying. I have always found that a first Review has influenced\r\nall the others except the very best. The excessive injustice and\r\nuntruthfulness this time made me understand the pain which Chatterton\r\nfelt, especially when it was said that the hundred and forty-seven\r\nquotations, which I had been at such pains to find for my “Versailles,”\r\nwere “all taken second-hand from Dussieux’ History” of that palace,\r\nthough I am assured that not one (!!) of them is to be found there,\r\nexcept the few taken from S. Simon, the especial historian of\r\nVersailles, to which any one writing about it would naturally apply.\r\n\r\n    “Every white will have its black,\r\n      And every sweet its sour,”\r\n\r\nand though serious disappointments are always a most bitter medicine,\r\nlife becomes much the same again after they are once swallowed and\r\nassimilated. I know they must be good for one, like all the other\r\nhumiliations of--is it?--yes, I suppose in a right spirit it may be, _le\r\nchemin de la croix_. Still I often wonder whether the writer of such an\r\narticle, when he _knows_ it is false and unjust, as this writer must\r\nhave done, does it with pleasure in taking away an author’s innocent\r\nenjoyment in the birth of his book-child. In most cases of personal\r\ninjustice and injury, I am sure that it answers to take some secret\r\nopportunity of doing something very kind towards the aggressor--it\r\n“takes out the taste;” but when the intentional injury is anonymous, one\r\nis deprived of even this consolation. Yet, to a certain extent, an inner\r\nconsciousness of high aims and disinterested intentions may raise a\r\nscreen against the base scurrilousness with which every one is assailed\r\nat some time in their lives. Fortunately, also, I have never\r\nquite--though very nearly--had to put in practice the maxim that--\r\n\r\n    “Those who live to please must please to live.”\r\n\r\nIt is curious, certainly, how one has only to turn to the pages of a\r\nbook which collects Reviews of past authors, like “Alibone’s\r\nDictionary,” to find plentiful consolation. I chanced to open it on\r\nThackeray, and found the _Edinburgh Review_, after abusing “Esmond” in\r\nthe most contemptuous tones, saying patronisingly, “If Esmond had been\r\nconfined within as short limits, it might have taken rank with the\r\n‘Defence of Natural Society,’ but a parody three volumes long becomes\r\ntiresome.” The same _Edinburgh Review_ advised Byron to abandon poetry\r\nand apply his talents to some better use; and declared Coleridge’s\r\n“Christabel” to be “a thing utterly destitute of value.” I think it is\r\nMontaigne who says, “Aucun chemin de fleurs ne conduit à la gloire.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nIN PLEASURE AND PAIN\r\n\r\n     “Why, of all the countless faces which I meet as I walk down the\r\n     Strand, are the enormous majority failures--deflections from the\r\n     type of beauty _possible_ to them?”--DEAN CHURCH.\r\n\r\n    “Before the beginning of years there came to the making of man,\r\n     Time with a gift of tears, Grief with a glass that ran.”\r\n               --SWINBURNE.\r\n\r\n    “From the black depths, the ashes, and the dross\r\n     Of our waste lives, we reach out to the Cross,\r\n     And by its fulness measure all our loss.”\r\n               --WHITTIER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the middle of October I went North for a short time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Thoresby, Oct. 20, 1887._--A visit here has been charming--its inmates\r\nall so filled with kindness and goodness of every description, and Lady\r\nManvers so very agreeable--‘une conversation si nourrie.” Nothing could\r\nexceed the dying splendour of the autumnal tints in the forest, of which\r\nwe saw a great deal, as we sat out through the whole of each morning\r\ndrawing amongst the tall golden bracken, over which the great antlers\r\nof a stag were now and then uplifted. My companions were Lady Mary\r\nPierrepont, very pretty and charming, and Mrs. Trebeck, daughter and\r\nsister of a Bishop Wordsworth, who is here with her husband, Canon\r\nTrebeck of Southwell, a very singular and admirable muscular Christian.\r\nThey have asked me to visit them. The first day of my visit I was\r\ndelighted to meet Lord and Lady Montagu, unusually pleasant people, with\r\na very nice daughter.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Southwell, Oct. 21._--Lord Manvers--kindest of hosts--sent me here,\r\nfourteen miles. It is a tiny town clustered around its--chiefly\r\nNorman--minster. The beautiful chapter-house has a wreathed door, before\r\nwhich Ruskin stood for an hour when he was here, motionless in rapt\r\ncontemplation. On one of the old Norman pillars on the right of the nave\r\nare remains of a fresco of the Annunciation, evidently painted over an\r\naltar of the Virgin: on the other side are traces of a very early organ.\r\nIn the graveyard is the tomb of Robert Lowe, Lord Sherbrooke’s father.\r\nThe Sub-dean and his wife are the centre around which the whole little\r\nplace revolves with its society and charities. The Bishop, who lives in\r\nthe country, seems rather to despise Southwell and to wish his cathedral\r\nhad been at Nottingham.\r\n\r\n“We went from Thoresby to Rufford,[469] a curious old low-lying house\r\ncontaining much fine tapestry, but where the old furniture is greatly\r\nmade up. The house has an obstreperous ghost, that especially haunted\r\nthe room which Augustus Lumley chose as his own, and frightened his\r\npug-dog out of its wits; for beyond that room is a little chamber in\r\nwhich a girl was once shut up and starved to death; but since some bones\r\nhave been found under one of the passages and received christian burial,\r\nthe ghost has been laid. There is a portrait of a boy who was taken as a\r\nbaby from gipsies and brought up in the house, but who disappeared after\r\nhe grew up and never was heard of again: it was supposed that the\r\nimpulse was too strong, and that he rejoined the tribe he came from.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Raby Castle, Oct. 25._--The Duchess of Cleveland has been describing\r\nLord Crawford’s interview with a famous clairvoyant. Lord Crawford saw\r\nthe medium go and hold his head in the fire: the flames played round him\r\nand he was quite unhurt. Then the medium said he could make Lord\r\nCrawford impervious to fire: ‘Would he like it?’ He said ‘yes,’ and the\r\nmedium took a large live coal from the fire and put it on the palm of\r\none of his hands, which was entirely unhurt, though the coal was left\r\nupon it, and Lord Crawford was told to light his cigar at it, which he\r\ndid. The clairvoyant then said, ‘Your other hand is not impervious:\r\ntouch the coal with it,’ and he touched the coal which lay in the palm\r\nof his left hand, and one of the fingers of his right hand bears the\r\nmarks of it still.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 26._--It has been a great pleasure during this visit that the\r\nDuke[470] has come in each morning for talk, generally more or less\r\nnarrative--in which he rises suddenly from his chair, walks rapidly\r\nbackwards and forwards to the fire, and then sits down again, always\r\nwith his sharp fiery restless look; but all he says most interesting.\r\nTo-day he told of his father’s early life,--sent to Oxford with a tutor,\r\nMr. Lipscombe, then abroad for three years, spent chiefly at Orleans\r\nlearning French with John, Duke of Bedford (the father of Lord Russell).\r\nThe Duke of Dorset was ambassador then, and took the two young men to\r\nVersailles, where they played billiards with Marie Antoinette. The\r\nFrench aristocracy were quite unconscious then of the coming danger, and\r\nwould not believe in the serious state of politics. The Duc de Bouillon\r\nwas the great person, and they stayed with him in the country. They went\r\non to Rome, where Cardinal York was then living. They went to his weekly\r\nreceptions, where he was always treated as royalty. ‘The Duchesse\r\nd’Albanie gave my father a ring,’ said the Duke, ‘but after my father’s\r\ndeath it was stolen from the Duchess Elisabeth by her maid. All young\r\nmen stayed abroad their three years at that time, and so did my father,\r\nthen as soon as he came home he was married to my mother, who was the\r\nDuke of Bolton’s daughter.\r\n\r\n“‘For myself, I went to Paris at eighteen in diplomacy, and was there\r\nfor many years. I spoke French better than English, and lived entirely\r\nin French society. Thiers I knew intimately in all the different phases\r\nof his life. He was said to have had an intrigue with Madame Dombes. I\r\ndon’t know how that may have been, but he married her daughter, and she\r\nmade him a very good wife. He always began his writing at six, when he\r\nhad a cup of coffee, and he wrote on--no one being allowed to disturb\r\nhim--till 12 A.M., which was the hour of _déjeûner_, and it was this\r\nwhich enabled him to write his histories; when he was in office he had\r\nnot time. He and Guizot were always rivals.\r\n\r\n“‘I was in Paris in Louis Philippe’s time, but not under the\r\nRestoration. Many of the Dames de la Cour of the older time, however,\r\nwere still in Paris, and had _salons_--Madame de Noailles, &c. I used to\r\nsee much of Princess Charlotte de Rohan, who had been privately married\r\nto the Duc d’Enghien, and whose excitement was great when Louis Philippe\r\nwas appointed. I was at Marienbad when the news of that revolution came,\r\nand posted back to Paris at once: we expected great difficulty on the\r\nway, but there was none. I saw the barricades, however, in the early\r\n_émeute_ of Louis Philippe’s time, and the people with their passions\r\nroused, and the _gamins_ who used to come under the windows of the\r\nPalais Royal and call for the king till he came out and made them a bow:\r\nit was the regular thing that was done.\r\n\r\n“‘I was at Paris when the Duc de Bourbon hung himself. Cuvier and\r\nanother great naturalist were sent down to examine into it, and they\r\nboth said he must have done it himself; but the Legitimists declared it\r\nwas an arrangement between the Orleanists and Madame de Feuchères, who\r\nshared his property between them.\r\n\r\n“‘I was at Coppet with Auguste de Staël a few years after Madame de\r\nStaël died: he asked Sismondi to meet me there and several others. Old\r\nMadame Necker--Madame de Staël’s mother--had a very remarkable _salon_\r\nin Paris: her daughter was Duchesse de Broglie and her grand-daughter\r\nmarried the Comte d’Haussonville, whom I knew very well: but, oh! it is\r\nmore than half a century ago now that I was at Coppet.’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 27._--Mrs. Forester, wife of the Duke’s nephew, who is here, has\r\ntold me much that is curious.\r\n\r\n“‘An old Mrs. Sauchiehall, unfortunately dead now, told Lady Vane that\r\nwhen she was a girl at Doncaster, at a famous school of that time, she\r\nmade a very intimate friendship with two other girls, and when they\r\nparted, they made each other a solemn vow that if either of the three\r\nwere in any real trouble in after life, the others would do all they\r\ncould to help her.\r\n\r\n“They parted, and Mrs. Sauchiehall married in Cumberland--married twice,\r\nand became a second time a widow. Life had seemed constantly to drift\r\nher away from her old friends. At last, at Marienbad, she met one of\r\nthem, then Mrs. A., and spent some weeks there with her, renewing all\r\ntheir old intimacy.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. A. told her that she had always continued to be on terms of the\r\nmost extreme intimacy with their third friend--Lady B. Her own story had\r\nbeen a very sad one. She had been left a widow with several children,\r\nand almost in a state of destitution. In all her troubles, she had\r\ncontinued to confide in Lady B., who never lost sight of her. At one\r\ntime especially, Lady B. was perplexed as to how she could help her, and\r\nspoke of it to her husband, who said, ‘Well, there is at least one thing\r\nI could do for her: there is that old place of ours in Dorsetshire,\r\nwhere nobody lives. It is all being kept up for nothing, so if Mrs. A.\r\nlikes to go and inhabit it, she is quite welcome; only, you know, she\r\nought to be told that it is said to be haunted.’\r\n\r\n“Lady B. made the proposal to Mrs. A., who was enchanted, and she moved\r\nat once with her children to the house in Dorsetshire, where she seemed\r\nto find a refuge from her troubles and every comfort. She asked the\r\nservants whom she found in the house about the ghosts, and they said,\r\n‘Oh yes, the great hall and the rooms beyond it are said to be haunted,\r\nbut we never go there, and the ghosts never come to our part of the\r\nhouse, so we are never troubled by them in the least.’ For several years\r\nMrs. A. lived most happily in the old house, and nothing happened.\r\n\r\n“At last, on one of her children’s birthdays, she invited some children\r\nfrom the neighbourhood to come and play with her own children, who\r\nbegged that, after tea, they might all go and play hide-and-seek in the\r\ngreat disused hall. The children had finished their games, and Mrs. A.\r\nwas alone in the hall setting things to rights afterwards, about 8 P.M.\r\nin the evening, with an unlighted candle in her hand, when she heard\r\nsome one call out loudly, ‘Bring me a light! bring me a light!’ Then,\r\nalmost immediately, the door from the inner passage leading to the\r\nfarther rooms opened, and a lady rushed in, beautifully dressed in\r\nwhite, but with all her dress in flames. She ran across the hall\r\nscreaming ‘She’s done it! she’s done it!’ and vanished through a door on\r\nthe other side. Mrs. A. instantly lighted her candle, and ran with it up\r\nthe passage from which the lady had emerged, but she found all the\r\ndoors locked. The next night, at exactly the same hour, she came again\r\nto the hall, and exactly the same thing happened. She then wrote to Lady\r\nB. that she should be obliged to leave the place, unless Lord B. could\r\nexplain the mystery.\r\n\r\n“Lord B. then said that an ancestress of his--a widowed Lady B.--had an\r\nonly son, who fell in love with the charming daughter of a neighbouring\r\nclergyman. The young lady was lovely, fascinating, and very well\r\neducated, but the mother regarded it as a mésalliance and would not hear\r\nof it. The young man, who was a very dutiful son, consented to gratify\r\nhis mother by waiting, and went abroad for two years. After that time,\r\nas their attachment was unbroken, and he was of age, he married the\r\nyoung lady.\r\n\r\n“It was with joyful surprise that the young married pair received a very\r\nkind letter from the mother, saying that as all was now settled, she\r\nshould make a point of welcoming the bride as her daughter, and always\r\nliving happily with her afterwards. They went home to the mother at the\r\nold house which Lord B. had lent to Mrs. A., and were most kindly\r\nreceived. All seemed perfectly smooth. At last a day came on which the\r\nmother had invited an immense party to be introduced to and do honour to\r\nthe bride. The evening arrived, and the young lady was already dressed,\r\nwhen her mother-in-law came into the room, kissed her affectionately,\r\nand then said to her son, ‘Now that she is indeed my daughter, I am\r\ngoing to fetch the family diamonds, that I may have the pleasure of\r\ndecorating her with them myself.’ The diamonds spoken of were really\r\nthe property of the son, but he had never liked to irritate his mother\r\nby claiming them, and rejoiced that his wife should accept them from\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“The mother then went to fetch the diamonds, the son lighting her. As\r\nthey were coming back, they heard the voice of the young lady calling to\r\nher husband to bring her a light. ‘Oh, I will take it to her,’ cried the\r\nmother suddenly, and snatched the candle out of his hand. In another\r\ninstant the girl rushed by with her white dress enveloped in flames,\r\nscreaming ‘She’s done it! she’s done it!’ The mother confessed that her\r\nhate and jealousy had been too much for her.\r\n\r\n“Now the house is pulled down, and a railway passes over its site.\r\n\r\n“Another curious story, told by Mrs. Sauchiehall to Lady Vane, was that\r\nof a young lady, a great Cumberland heiress, who was engaged to be\r\nmarried, but who pined away from some mysterious and causeless illness.\r\nAs there was no definite reason for her being ill, so nothing seemed to\r\ndo her any good, but she wasted constantly, and at last she died. After\r\nher death, her old nurse, who had been her devoted attendant, rather\r\nsurprised those who knew her by insisting upon leaving the place and\r\nmoving to the south of England. A cousin succeeded to the property, but\r\ndid not prosper. His wife died, then his children, one after another. A\r\nghostly appearance also frequently took place, and was especially seen\r\nby a little boy, the son of the house. At last the whole family became\r\nextinct, and quite passed away out of Cumberland memory.\r\n\r\n“Many, many years afterwards, Mrs. Sauchiehall was herself at Richmond\r\nin Surrey, when she heard that a very old woman, a native of Cumberland,\r\nwas dying in the workhouse--dying, apparently, with some secret upon her\r\nmind, which she could not bring herself to confess, but which never\r\nallowed her to rest. ‘Well,’ said Mrs. Sauchiehall to her informant, ‘I\r\nam a Cumberland woman myself; I will see what I can do.’ She went to the\r\nworkhouse, and soon found that the old woman had been the nurse of the\r\nyoung heiress who had died so long before, and heard her confess that\r\nshe had accepted a large bribe from the cousin who succeeded, to poison\r\nher by slow degrees. The bribe had done her no good. She had married,\r\nall her children had died, her husband had gambled away her money, and\r\nshe herself had come to die in the workhouse.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Forester told me of a girl who had gone to a famous school at\r\nBrighton. She was allowed to study after hours to fit her for the place\r\nof a pupil-teacher, which she wanted to get. After some time, she looked\r\nso pale and thin, that the mistress thought she was over-worked and\r\ncalled in a doctor. He asked her many questions, and at last ‘if she\r\never saw any strange visions.’ This she could conscientiously say she\r\ndid not. On learning this, the doctor said that being the case, it could\r\ndo her no harm to continue her studies, but that if she ever fancied she\r\nsaw anything unusual, it would be a sign that her brain was overworked,\r\nand she must give up her studies at once.\r\n\r\n“It was very soon after this that one night she distinctly heard the\r\ndoor of her room, which was behind a screen at the foot of her bed,\r\nopen and shut again. She got up and went to the door, but it was closed,\r\nand when she opened it, there was no one there. This happened several\r\ntimes. At last she locked the door. Still it happened again. That night,\r\nhowever, she assured herself that the delusion came from being\r\nover-tired, and by sheer force of will she went to sleep.\r\n\r\n“The next night, however, the same thing happened, and she again locked\r\nthe door. Happening to look up soon after, she saw something hanging\r\nover the screen in front of her. It was a hand--an attenuated human\r\nhand. It remained there some time, then it disappeared.\r\n\r\n“The girl then felt that she must lessen her studies, but, for fear they\r\nshould be stopped altogether, she said nothing, whilst at the school, of\r\nwhat she had seen. Soon after this, however, she went home to the old\r\naunt who had brought her up, and who was in very poor circumstances. She\r\nwas almost surprised at the extreme and anxious tenderness with which\r\nshe was received. After tea she said, ‘Auntie, I have a curious little\r\nstory I want to tell you,’ and she told her what she had seen. The aunt\r\nsaid, ‘My love, you have unconsciously made easier for me the task of\r\ntelling you some very sad news; I did not know how to break it to you,\r\nbut Edward’ (the young man to whom the girl was engaged) ‘is dead; he\r\ndied the night you saw the hand.’\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Forester told this story to Lord Rayleigh, who said, ‘That is a\r\nvery simple and explicable story: it is a case of telepathy.’\r\n\r\n“The Duchess of Cleveland says that when the Sultan was at Buckingham\r\nPalace, one of his servants offended him, and he condemned him to death.\r\nThe Sultan was informed that he could not execute him in this country;\r\nthen he said he should do it on board his own ship. One of his wives\r\nalso is said to have been executed whilst he was here, ‘because, poor\r\nthing, she had been so dreadfully sea-sick, that it was quite\r\ndisgusting,’ and she is said to be buried in the palace garden.\r\n\r\n“‘Mr. Lowell asserted to me,’ said the Duchess, ‘that there were no\r\nreally old families in England. “Surely the Nevilles?” I protested. The\r\nnext morning Lowell said, “I’ve been thinking that I am descended myself\r\nfrom the Nevilles, but I never thought it worth while before to inquire\r\nabout it.”’\r\n\r\n“‘Some one went,’ said the Duchess, ‘to inquire after the health of\r\nMadame Brunnow. “Oh,” said the servant, “she will never be any better.”\r\nThe inquirer was admitted afterwards to see Baron Brunnow, to whom he\r\nsaid, “I am so grieved to hear from your servant that Madame Brunnow is\r\nnever likely to be any better.” “Did he really say that?” said Baron\r\nBrunnow. “Oh, the faithfulness of these English servants! The fact is,\r\nMadame Brunnow really died three days ago; but the servant knows that it\r\nwas not at all convenient that she should die before the reception of\r\nthe Duke of Edinburgh is over, so--for inquirers--she is still only very\r\nill.”’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_“Raby Castle, Oct. 28._--A pleasant Mr. and Mrs.\r\nWilkinson--neighbours--came to stay yesterday. He told me a very\r\nremarkable story.\r\n\r\n“One day last year, Mr. Gurdon, an excellent Catholic priest belonging\r\nto a mission in the East End of London, had come in from his labours\r\ndreadfully wet and tired, and rejoicing in the prospect of a quiet\r\nevening, when the bell rung, and he was told that a lady wanted to see\r\nhim on most urgent business. He said to a friend who was with him, how\r\nsincerely he dreaded being called out again into the wet that night, and\r\nhow he hoped that the visit meant nothing of the kind; but he admitted\r\nthe lady. She was a remarkably sweet, gentle-looking person, who told\r\nhim that there was a case in most urgent need of his immediate\r\nministrations at No. 24 in a street near, and she implored him to come\r\nat once, saying that she would wait to point out the house to him. So he\r\nonly stayed to change his wet things, and then prepared to follow the\r\nlady. He took with him the Host, which he wore against his breast,\r\nholding, as is the custom, his hand over it. It is not considered right\r\nfor a priest carrying the Host to engage in conversation, so Mr. Gurdon\r\ndid not speak to the lady on the way to the house, but she walked a\r\nlittle way in front of him. At last she stopped, pointed to a house, and\r\nsaid, ‘This, Father, is No. 24.’ Then she passed on and left him.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Gurdon rang the bell, and when the servant came, asked who it was\r\nwho was seriously ill in the house. The servant looked much surprised\r\nand said there was no illness there at all. Much astonished, Mr. Gurdon\r\nsaid he thought the servant must be mistaken, that he had been summoned\r\nto the house to a case in most urgent need. The servant insisted that\r\nthere was no illness; but Mr. Gurdon would not go away without seeing\r\nthe owner of the house, and was shown up to a sitting-room, where he\r\nfound the master of the house, a pleasant-looking young man of about\r\nfive-and-twenty. To him Mr. Gurdon told how he had been brought there,\r\nand the young man assured him that there must be some mistake--there was\r\ncertainly no illness in the house; and to satisfy Mr. Gurdon, he sent\r\ndown to his servants, and ascertained that they were all perfectly well.\r\n\r\n“A tea-supper was upon the table, and very cordially and kindly the\r\nyoung man asked Mr. Gurdon to sit down to it with him. He pressed it, so\r\nthey had tea together and much pleasant conversation. Eventually the\r\nyoung man said, ‘I also am a Catholic,’ adding, in an ingenuous way,\r\n‘but I fear you would think a very bad one;’ and he explained that the\r\nsacraments and confession had long been practically unknown to him. ‘As\r\nlong as my dear mother lived,’ he said, ‘it was different: but she died\r\nthree years ago, and since her death I have paid no attention to\r\nreligion.’ And he described the careless life he had been leading.\r\n\r\n“Very earnestly and openly Mr. Gurdon talked with him, urging him to\r\namend his ways, to go back to his old serious life. At first he urged it\r\nfor his mother’s sake, then from higher motives. He seemed to make an\r\nimpression, and the young man was touched by what he said, and said no\r\none had spoken to him thus since his mother died. At last Mr. Gurdon\r\nsaid, ‘Why should you not begin a new life now? I might hear your\r\nconfession, and then be able to give you absolution this very evening.\r\nBut I should not wish you to decide this hurriedly: let me leave you for\r\nan hour--let me leave you perfectly alone for that time--you will then\r\nbe able to think over your confession, and decide what you ought to tell\r\nme.’ The young man consented, but urged Mr. Gurdon not to leave the\r\nhouse again in the rain: there were a fire and lights in the library,\r\nwould not Mr. Gurdon wait there?\r\n\r\n“Mr. Gurdon willingly went to spend the time in the library, where two\r\ncandles were lighted on the chimney-piece. Between these he placed the\r\nHost. Then he occupied himself by examining the pictures in the room.\r\nThere were many fine engravings, and there was also the crayon portrait\r\nof a lady which struck him very much. He seemed to remember the original\r\nquite well, and yet he could not recall where he had seen her. On going\r\nback to the other room, he told the young man how very much he had been\r\nstruck by the picture. ‘Ah!’ he said, ‘that is the portrait of my dear\r\nmother, and it is indeed the greatest comfort I have, it is so very like\r\nher.’ At that moment Mr. Gurdon suddenly recollected where he had seen\r\nthe lady: she it was who had come to fetch him to the house.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Gurdon heard the young man’s confession and gave him absolution; he\r\nseemed to be in the most serious and earnest frame of mind. He could not\r\nreceive the sacrament, because it must be taken fasting, so the evening\r\nmeal they had had made it impossible. But it was arranged that he should\r\ncome to the chapel at eight o’clock the next morning, and that he\r\nshould receive it then. Mr. Gurdon went home most deeply interested in\r\nthe case, and truly thankful for having been led to it; but when morning\r\ncame, and the service took place in the chapel, to his bitter\r\ndisappointment the young man was not there. He feared that he had\r\nrelapsed altogether, but he could not leave him thus, and as soon as the\r\nservice was over he hastened to his house. When he reached it, the\r\nblinds were all down. The old female servant who opened the door was in\r\nfloods of tears: her master had died in his sleep.\r\n\r\n“On the last evening of his life his mother had brought Father Gurdon to\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Muncaster Castle, Oct. 30._--What a gloriously beautiful place this\r\nis!--an ascent from the station, and then a descent through massy woods,\r\ntill the castle appears--infinitely picturesque in outline and in its\r\nred and grey colouring--on the edge of a gorge, wooded on both sides,\r\nand which now has every tint, from the dark blue-green of the hollies\r\nand the russet of dead fern, through crimson, scarlet, orange, to the\r\nfaintest primrose colour of the fading chestnut leaves. Then behind are\r\nthe finest of Cumbrian mountains, and in front terraced gardens, and the\r\nnot far distant sea. The interior has almost an equal charm, in the\r\nthick velvet-pile carpets of the long passages hung with portraits, the\r\nfine collection of books in the (too dark) octagonal library, and the\r\nlow hall, which has an organ, flowers, and books, and is the common\r\nsitting-room. I sleep in ‘the ghost-room,’ and in a red silk bed used by\r\nHenry VI. when he was here, and when he gave ‘the luck of Muncaster’ to\r\nthe family--an old Venetian glass bowl, from which every child of the\r\nhouse has been christened since. Once it was thrown from an upper\r\nwindow: the owners never had the courage to hunt for and examine it, and\r\nit remained buried in the earth for some years: then it was dug up quite\r\nuninjured.\r\n\r\n“We have driven up Eskdale--a delightfully wild mountain glen, with a\r\nclear, tossing river, and dark mountains of jagged outline, covered with\r\nbrown bracken wherever a turfy space is left between the rocks.\r\n\r\n“My host--‘Josceline’--is geniality itself, and very amusing, and Lady\r\nMuncaster excessively pleasant. Only her sister, pretty Lady Kilmarnock,\r\nis here with her little Ivan, and two young ladies, Miss Rhoda Lestrange\r\nand Miss Winifred Yorke,[471] whom her friends call ‘Frivolina.’ The\r\nMuncasters have lived here for six hundred years; then they came from\r\nPennington, where a mound still exists which was crowned by their\r\nresidence in ancient British times.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Alnwick Castle, Nov. 4._--Yesterday I left Muncaster at eight, and had\r\ntwo hours in the middle of the day to wait at Carlisle. Whilst I was\r\nsauntering round the cathedral, one of the Canons came up to me,\r\nintroduced himself as a college acquaintance--son of Richmond the\r\nartist--and asked me to luncheon. He also showed me the cathedral,\r\n‘restored’ out of much interest, with a miserable modern reredos and\r\nother rubbish, but with two fine old tombs, and the modern monuments of\r\nPaley and Law. Below the great east window Sir Walter Scott was married.\r\nA noble fragment remains of a beautiful renaissance screen, and at the\r\nback of the stalls are very curious early pictures of the lives of S.\r\nAnthony, S. Augustine, &c. Close to the cathedral is the Fratry--the\r\nrefectory of the abbey--now used for lectures. Carlisle is a black and\r\ntruly uninviting place.\r\n\r\n“Lady Airlie and Lady Griselda Ogilvy were at the station, and I\r\ntravelled with them as far as Naworth. On arriving here, it was pleasant\r\nto be met by the cordial welcome of Duchess Eleanor, always most genial\r\nand kind. The actual Duchess[472] did not appear till dinner, when she\r\nwas wheeled into the room in a chair, very sweet and attractive-looking,\r\nbut very fragile. The Duke[473] looks wiry, refined, rather bored, and\r\nsome people would find him very alarming. Lord and Lady Percy seem to be\r\ntwo of the most silent people in the world--she pretty still in spite of\r\nher ten children. There are also here pleasant little Lady Constance\r\nCampbell, Miss Ellison, who goes about with Duchess Eleanor, and Lady\r\nEmma and Miss M’Neile--the former a violent Radical, who went to bed at\r\nonce when the Primrose League became the topic of conversation. We\r\nplayed at whist in the evening, but it was broken at ten by going to\r\nprayers, which the Duke reads in the chapel. It is the only time I have\r\nseen evening prayers in any country-house for the last fifteen years.\r\n\r\n“This morning Duchess Eleanor showed me the rooms--the magnificent\r\nItalian rooms, which owe their glory to her husband, Duke Algernon, who,\r\nwhen remonstrated with for thus changing a mediaeval fortress, said,\r\n‘Would you wish us only to sit on benches upon a floor strewn with\r\nrushes?’ He purchased the whole of the great Camuccini collection at\r\nRome, because of his great wish to have one single picture, which they\r\nwould not sell separately. It is the so-called ‘Feast of the Gods’ by\r\nGian Bellini, with a landscape by Titian. Other noble pictures involved\r\nin the purchase are a Crucifixion by Guido, singularly dark for the\r\nmaster; a splendid portrait attributed to Andrea del Sarto, but more\r\nlike Franciabigio; and a little Raffaelle of SS. Mary Magdalen and\r\nCatherine. Bought from the Manfrini Palace at Venice are two noble works\r\nof Pordenone--one of them the picture of the father, mother, and son\r\nmentioned by Byron (in ‘Beppo’). From the Davenport collection are\r\nportions of a grand fresco of the ‘Salutation,’ by Sebastian del Piombo,\r\nonce in S. Maria della Pace at Rome. The magnificent decorations of the\r\nrooms are by Canina. But the most lasting attraction of the castle is\r\nthe library, with the really splendid collection of books formed by Duke\r\nAlgernon.\r\n\r\n“The Percies are Irvingites now, as well as the Duke and Duchess. Her\r\nfather, Mr. Drummond, was ‘one of the twelve apostles,’ in whose time it\r\nis a tenet of faith that the Lord must return. Now only one ‘apostle’ is\r\nalive, and when he dies what will happen? Meantime, though a very old\r\nman, he is hard at work beating up recruits and inciting proselytism.\r\nThe family go to the church here, but then the vicar of Alnwick is also\r\nan Irvingite. All the gibberish which the Irvingites talk when seized by\r\nthe spirit is taken down and treasured up as ‘prophecy.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALNWICK CASTLE.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 5._--This Irvingite family is constantly waiting and looking out\r\nfor the millennium: it is terribly anxious work. But their faith is most\r\nsimple and touching. When one of the Percy boys was very ill, they had\r\nhim anointed with oil; after that he recovered. ‘We had no doubt it\r\nwould be so,’ said Lady Percy, ‘no doubt whatever.’ After the anointing,\r\nthe friends of a patient have altogether done with human agency, and\r\nleave everything in the Divine hands. It is curious to hear members of\r\nthis family say casually--‘The angel was here on Monday, and will be\r\nhere again on Friday.’\r\n\r\n“I have had an interesting hour with the Duchess in her own\r\nsitting-room, where she showed me all the treasures in her cabinet--two\r\nminiatures of Elizabeth, contemporary, for they are painted without any\r\nshadow, which she forbade, upon her face, and two others, evidently\r\npainted afterwards, and naturally much more becoming; a miniature of\r\nMary Queen of Scots painted in prison, with the fat face and thick neck\r\nwhich want of exercise caused in one used to so much riding; some of the\r\nhair of Charles I., cut off by Sir Henry Halford when the king’s coffin\r\nwas opened at Windsor; miniatures of James I., Anne of Denmark, and\r\nthree of their children; the splendid ‘George’ of the fifth Earl of\r\nNorthumberland, made with the blue enamel which is now a lost art; one\r\nof the amber snuff-boxes which Queen Charlotte had constructed in\r\nGermany for her ladies, with her miniature on the outside, her dog\r\ninside the lid, and her monkey at the bottom of the box; the pencil-case\r\nof Lord Chesterfield, with a diamond at the end, being the pencil\r\nmentioned by Pope. Not less interesting is a little (Dutch) silver\r\nwoman, which runs by clockwork, because it was the means of saving all\r\nthe family plate. For when burglars broke into Sion, it scampered about\r\nthe floor when they were going to pack it up, which made them think the\r\nplate was possessed, and they took to flight, leaving all their booty\r\nbehind, with the baskets in which they had intended to carry it off.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 6._--All this morning I was left to ‘browse in the library,’ as\r\nDr. Johnson expresses it. In the afternoon I had a walk with the Duke\r\nand Percy to Alnwick Abbey--utterly unknown to history, and with only\r\nthe ruin of its fine gateway standing, yet which must have been one of\r\nthe most important buildings in the North of England. Its substructions\r\nwere sought and dug for in exact accordance with the rules laid down for\r\nbuilding a Premonstratensian abbey, and so they were found. The church\r\nmust have been grand as any cathedral.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Nov. 27, 1887._--I am greatly enjoying a little solitude in\r\nthis time so congenial for hard work, when all nature seems wrapped in a\r\nswampy mist-cloud. There are great improvements in the garden. Along\r\nthat little upper walk to the field, where the frames were, is now a\r\nrockery with rare heaths, and behind it a bed of kalmias, and then the\r\ncypress hedge of my especial little garden. Rock and fern are also put\r\non the steep descent to the pond, opposite the line of tree-fuchsias.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if you remember hearing of the extraordinary visitation of\r\ncrickets on the night of (my mother’s death) Nov. 12-13, seventeen years\r\nago--the uproar, like the sea in a storm, all night, scarcely allowing a\r\nvoice to be heard: then heard no more till the night, twelve years\r\nafter, in which dear Lea passed away. I was so struck by coming across\r\nan allusion to it when reading the last chapter of Ecclesiastes as the\r\nlesson in church last Sunday--‘And the grasshopper shall become a\r\nburden, because man goeth to his long home.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOLMHURST FROM THE SHRUBBERY.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 24._--The dreary Christmas season of damp and dyspepsia, bills\r\nand bother, is less odious than usual this year, as the day itself is\r\nswallowed up in Sunday. I have, however, also had a real pleasure in a\r\npresent from the Duchess of Cleveland of her Life of Everard Primrose,\r\nonly printed for his friends. It is most beautifully, touchingly, really\r\nnobly done, and the most perfect memorial of a high-minded\r\nsingle-hearted young man’s life. I think I never read so perfect a\r\nbiography. The story is entirely told in Everard’s own admirable\r\nletters, but the Duchess has not shrunk from her own part, and the\r\nlittle touches from her own life, the Duke’s, &c., are indescribably\r\nsimple, graceful, and sincere. The book gives one a far higher opinion\r\nof _her_ (of Everard I had always the very highest), and makes one\r\nregret many hasty judgments. I have been quite engrossed with the book,\r\nso perfectly delightful is it.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter a busy six weeks of work, I spent the New Year again at Cobham,\r\nalways charming in its quiet home life, but was glad to return soon\r\nagain to work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Feb. 10, 1888._--The news of Lady Marian Alford’s sudden\r\ndeath removes from the cycle of life one whom I had felt to be a true\r\nfriend for more than thirty years. Our meetings were at long intervals,\r\nbut when we met, it was as more than mere acquaintances. With a grace\r\nwhich was all her own, she often unfolded beautiful chapters in her own\r\nlife to me, and she was one of the very few persons who have read in\r\nmanuscript much of these written volumes of my past. She was a perfect\r\n_grande dame_, unable to harbour an ignoble thought, incapable of a\r\nsmall action. Regal, imperious, and extravagant,[474] she was generous,\r\nkind, and personally most unselfish, and, had the real greatness and\r\ngoodness that was in her been regulated and disciplined by the\r\ncircumstances of her early life, she would have been one of the noblest\r\nwomen of her century. Alas! only yesterday she was! How soon one has to\r\nschool oneself to say ‘would have been.’ Thus, however, it will\r\ncertainly be with oneself. The day after one dies people will say--and\r\nhow few with even a pang--‘He would: he might have been.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 14._--Met Lady Fergusson Davy (_née_ Fortescue). She told me\r\nthat when Lady Hills Johnes, the friend of Thirlwall, was twenty-four,\r\nshe was once in society with the late Lord Lytton, who was talking of\r\nsecond-sight, and of his own power of seeing the future of those he was\r\nwith. She urged him very much to tell her future, but he was very\r\nunwilling to do so. Still she urged it so much that at last he did. He\r\ndid it after the manner of the Chaldees--told it to her, and wrote it\r\ndown at the same time in hieroglyphics. He said, ‘You will have a very\r\ngreat sorrow, which will shake your faith in man: then you will have\r\nanother even greater sorrow, which will come to you through an old and\r\ntrusted servant: you will marry late in life a king among men, and the\r\nclose of your existence will be cloudlessly happy.’ All the first part\r\nof the prophecy has come true--the breaking off of her first\r\nengagement; the terrible murder of her father by his servant; her\r\nmarriage with Sir James Hills; all that remains now is happiness.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, May 14._--I have just returned from an interesting month in\r\nLondon, seeing many people delightfully and making some pleasant new\r\nacquaintance. At Lady Delawarr’s I was presented to the young Duchess of\r\nMecklenbourg, very pretty and full of life and animation. No one else\r\ncame up to talk to her, and I was left to make conversation from five\r\ntill a quarter to seven! by which time I think we had both exhausted all\r\npossible topics, though she was very charming. At last she said, ‘I\r\nalways go at six to read to the Duchess of Cambridge.’--‘Well, ma’am,’ I\r\nanswered, ‘you will certainly be terribly late to-day.’--‘What very odd\r\nthings you do say to me!’ she said. The next day I sent her my ‘Walks in\r\nLondon,’ and as her speaking of the Duchess of Cambridge convinced me of\r\nher identity, I directed to the ‘Hereditary Grand Duchess of\r\nMecklenbourg-Strelitz.’ The next time I saw her I had found out, and\r\nsaid, ‘I am sorry, ma’am, that I have made three mistakes in one line in\r\ndirecting to you--that you are not ‘Hereditary,’ not ‘Grand,’ and not\r\n‘Strelitz;’ for she was the Duchess Paul of Mecklenbourg-Schwerin; but\r\nshe laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n“In going to London, I first saw, on a placard at the station, that\r\nMatthew Arnold was dead. It seemed to carry away a whole joyous part of\r\nlife in a moment--for I have known Matthew Arnold ever since I remember\r\nanything, though I did not know till I lost him that his happy\r\npersonality and cordial welcome had made a real difference to me for\r\nyears, especially in the rooms of the Athenaeum, where I have spent so\r\nmuch time of late years. He had an evergreen youth, and died young at\r\nsixty-six, and he was so impregnated with social tact and courtesy, as\r\nwell as with intellectual buoyancy, that he was beyond all men liveable\r\nwith. Herman Merivale has written some lines which seem to express what\r\nI shall always remember--\r\n\r\n    ‘Thrice happy he, whose buoyant youth\r\n        In light of Beauty sought for Truth,\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     And to the longing listener showed\r\n        How Beauty decks the ugliest road.’\r\n\r\n“All who knew Matthew Arnold well loved him, though ‘the Apostle of\r\nModeration in Criticism’ would certainly have been shocked by some of\r\nthe fulsome articles which have followed his death; and I doubt of any\r\nof his writings surviving his generation, especially his refined and\r\ndelicate verses, which surely lack the fire of a poet whose work is to\r\nbe eternal. I went on April 19, with Montagu Wood, to his funeral in the\r\ngraveyard of the ancient church at Laleham, where his father was vicar\r\nbefore he went to Rugby, and where his children are buried. It was a day\r\nof pitiless rain, which pelted upon the widow and sisters and crowd of\r\nmourners round the grave, and on the piles of exquisite flowers beneath\r\nwhich his coffin was hidden. As Alfred Austin says in a beautiful\r\narticle upon him, ‘Wherever he lies, there will be a Campo-Santo.’ I was\r\nglad in going down to the funeral to make friends with Edward Arnold, a\r\ncharming fellow, who is the present editor of _Murray’s Magazine_.\r\n\r\n“At dinner at the Miss Monks’ I was interested to find myself sitting\r\nnext to Lady Sawle, who told me that she was niece of the Rose Aylmer\r\nwho was the love of Landor’s youth. It was on her that he wrote the\r\nlines which Archbishop Trench declared to be better than many an epic,\r\nand which Charles Lamb said he lived upon for a fortnight. Lady Sawle\r\nwas herself one of the three Roses to whom Landor afterwards addressed a\r\npoem, the third Rose being her mother. She described the death, when she\r\nwas at Rome, of Miss Bathurst--beautiful, radiant, and a splendid\r\nhorsewoman, riding along the narrow path between the Acqua Acetosa and\r\nthe Ponte Molle. The horse suddenly slipped backwards into the Tiber.\r\nShe called out to Lord Aylmer, ‘Uncle, save me!’ but he could not swim,\r\nnor could any of the gentlemen or the groom who was present. Another\r\ngroom, who was a good swimmer, had been sent back to Rome with a restive\r\nhorse. She sank in her long blue habit, and her body was never found.\r\nAll Rome mourned ‘La bella Inglesa,’ and the little party of friends,\r\nclosely united and present at her death, dispersed sadly. One of them\r\nalone, Mr. Charles Mills (of the Villa Mills), returned to Rome in the\r\nautumn. As he was about to enter the city, he sent his carriage on to\r\nthe gate from the Ponte Molle, and walked slowly along the Tiber bank by\r\nwhat had been the scene of the accident six months before. As he walked,\r\nhe saw two peasants on the other side of the river catch at something\r\nwhich looked like a piece of blue cloth on the mud, and pass on. A\r\nsudden impulse seized him, and he got some men to come at once with\r\nspades and dig there in the Tiber bank. There Miss Bathurst was found as\r\nif she were embalmed, in her blue riding-habit, perfectly beautiful, and\r\nwith her long hair over her shoulders. There was only one little mark of\r\na wound in her forehead. For a minute she was visible in all her\r\nloveliness--a minute only. She was buried in the English cemetery.”[475]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S. FLOUR, FROM THE SOUTH.][476]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHÂTEAU DU ROI, S.

How full each week seemed!--the two first alone\r\namongst quiet villages and churches in Picardy and afterwards in\r\nAuvergne, and many others after my friend Hugh Bryans joined me at wild\r\nS. Flour, in the hill country of Auvergne, at beautiful Obazine, and at\r\nRocamadour again, then at beautiful S. Emilion, in wandering amongst the\r\ninnumerable historic relics of La Vendée; lastly by the Loire and its\r\nsurroundings. Three places especially come back to me with pleasant\r\nmemories--the home-like inn at S. Emilion, its beautiful old buildings\r\nradiant with the blossom of pinks and valerian, and the sunset walks on\r\nits old walls looking into the vineyards and cornfields:--the little\r\nfishing port of Le Croisic, with its gay boats, its snow-white houses,\r\nand its windy surroundings:--and charming Clisson, with its pleasant\r\ninn and its balconies overhung with roses and wistaria. Hugh was a\r\ncapital companion, and full of interest in what he saw, though--like so\r\nmany at twenty-four--he pretended to hate all the historic detail.\r\nHowever, I am sure my endless archaeological inquiries must have sorely\r\ntried his patience, and he was always unweariedly good to me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Beauvais, June 1, 1888._--A number of friends wrote urging me to give\r\nup what was ‘entirely an imaginary duty.’ However, I felt it was a duty\r\nto finish what I had worked at so long, though perhaps it had not been a\r\nduty to begin it; and so, much as I hated coming, I am here! It is no\r\nuse thinking of all one has left, and there is a great deal in what one\r\n_has_, most of all _le grand air_ for hours and hours, and the\r\nmarvellous light and shade, which is in itself such a beauty in this\r\npellucid atmosphere. Then the peasants in Western France are delightful,\r\nand I have not much fear of being taken up here; and I come so well\r\nprimed and informed that I know exactly what to look for everywhere, and\r\nwhere to find it, and almost what to say about it.\r\n\r\n“I left dear Holmhurst at 6.30 P.M. and at 2.30 A.M. was carrying my own\r\nportmanteau down the desolate moonlit streets of Abbeville, where the\r\nold town struck me more than ever, such a complete change from England,\r\nand so romantically picturesque.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Clermont Ferrand, June 9._--Oh, it has been so hot! Never in my life\r\nhave I been so grilled, roasted, boiled, and melted down; and it has\r\nbeen hard having to work on all day, whatever the intense exhaustion\r\nfrom the heat. But I have kept up to exactly the tale of work measured\r\nout for each day before I left home.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Le Puy, June 13._--We had an exquisite journey on Tuesday by rail down\r\nthe valley of the Alagnon to Neussargues, the quantity of old castles on\r\nthe rocky hills as striking as those on the Rhine were forty years ago,\r\nand the mountain flowers lovely. Then we drove up through the cool\r\nforests to the high plateau which is under snow nine months of the year,\r\nand which was quite chilly even now. Here, in the evening, we reached\r\nthe old episcopal town of S. Flour, on a great basaltic rock, the most\r\nwonderfully placed of all French cities, and much recalling Orvieto.\r\nEverything seemed to belong to another world. From my window I could\r\nthrow anything sheer down the most tremendous of quite perpendicular\r\nprecipices, and the view was magnificent. The house had been in the same\r\nfamily for four hundred years, and the landlady showed with pride the\r\ndark passage where her ancestor intercepted the Protestants when they\r\nwere trying to take the city by stealth, the stone on which they were\r\nbeheaded, and the drain by which their blood flowed away. The other side\r\nof the house opened into a great square, with the cathedral standing\r\namongst trees as in an English close, and houses with sixteenth-century\r\ncolonnades. I saw the huge modern viaduct bridge of Garrabit, most\r\nextraordinary certainly, but though much more interesting to most\r\npeople, less so to me than the glorious views of S. Flour itself, on its\r\nblack and orange rocks, backed by the great purple towers of the\r\ncathedral.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Augustus J. C. Hare\r\n\r\n1888]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S.

Nectaire le Haut, June 28._--It was dark and raining in torrents\r\nbefore we arrived here, and the driver suddenly announced not only that\r\nhe had lost his way, but that one of our wheels was likely to come off!\r\nWe were skirting a precipice by a rocky road without any parapet, and at\r\nlast, by holding the carriage lamps low, found that we had somehow got\r\ninto a very ancient churchyard, where stone coffins were strewn all\r\nabout. At last we knocked up a woman at a farmhouse, who guided us back\r\nto the hotel, which we had long passed in the dark. This is an\r\nenchanting place, beautifully situated in a wooded gorge below the old\r\nromanesque church, where the Sunday congregation--from many far-away\r\nvillages--winding up the hill with baskets of food for the day, has been\r\nmost picturesque. There are lovely walks in all directions, and\r\nSwitzerland at its best never had more beautiful flowers, fields covered\r\nwith lilies, orchis, narcissus, globe ranunculus, pansies, pinks, &c.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Le Croisic, July 17._--At this little fishing-town there is no fine\r\nscenery, but it is most artistically lovely, with wide views over the\r\ngrey reaches of sea and yellow sandy flats to the soft hills, and\r\nendless fishing-boats with red sails and nets.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday we spent the day at La Guerande, a little unaltered mediaeval\r\ntown above the salt-flats; a very superior Winchelsea, described in\r\nBalzac’s wonderful novel of ‘Beatrix.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI returned to England on August 7th, just in time to attend Alwyne\r\nGreville’s wedding in London. In September I paid the Eustace Cecils a\r\nvisit, and then went to the Spencer Smiths at Kingston near Wareham.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATE OF LA GUERANDE.][479]\r\n\r\n“_Sept. 17._--It was a great pleasure to find Sir Howard and Lady\r\nElphinstone at the Eustace Cecils’. I like them both so very much. They\r\nsay the Queen is much occupied in learning Hindustanee and speaks it\r\nnow quite well--a great delight to her Indian subjects. She has three\r\nIndian servants in constant attendance, and converses fluently with\r\nthem. This afternoon has been delightful, with Mrs. Spencer Smith and\r\nher children, at St. Alban’s (St. Aldhelm’s) Head. In the little hollow\r\nwith stone cottages on the way thither a boy opened a gate for us whose\r\nname was Sagittary Clump. The name came from his parents’ lodger, but it\r\nmust have had its origin in Sagittarius. Mrs. Spencer Smith spoke to the\r\nboy’s father about his daughter’s misconduct. ‘I can’t help it,’ he\r\nsaid; ‘I’d given her her documents,’ meaning that he had spoken to her\r\nseriously: Shakspeare uses ‘documents’ in the same sense. Walking up the\r\nhill, we were terribly bitten by harvest-bugs, which little Michael\r\nSmith poetically called ‘Ces petites bêtes rouges dans les fleurs\r\nbleues’ (harebells). Close to the coastguard station, near the edge of\r\nthe cliff, is a tiny chapel, perfectly square, supported by a single\r\npillar, and with only one wee romanesque window, so that almost all the\r\nlight comes from the open door: however, there is only service here in\r\nsummer. A monk of Sherborne Abbey was always kept here to toll a bell to\r\nwarn off ships, whilst he prayed for the shipwrecked. Seven little\r\nchildren aged from three to four came up to us while we were drawing.\r\n‘We be going to throw ourselves over the cliff, we be: we be going to\r\nsmash ourselves quite up, we be,’ the little monsters announced to their\r\nmothers, as they all seven marched away arm-in-arm to the edge of the\r\ncliff. Then ‘little sister’ made ‘Ernest’ sit down upon a thistle, at\r\nwhich ‘Ernest’ roared; and finally the mother caught up Ernest and\r\ncarried it off, ‘little sister’ whacking its little naked behind with a\r\nstick all the way as they went. Then a young Palgrave appeared, who took\r\nthe Spencer Smith children down to a wreck in Chapman’s (Shipman’s) Bay,\r\nto their great delight. There were seven parrots saved from that ship,\r\nbut one was lost which was prepared for death by being able to say the\r\nLord’s Prayer straight through. We went afterwards to the desolate\r\nvillage of Worth, where, in the wind-stricken rectory, the clergyman and\r\nhis wife see no one for five months of the year, and have to shout into\r\neach other’s ears to be audible in the roaring winter blast. The church\r\nhas a Saxon arch, and in its graveyard two stone sarcophagi, one that of\r\na child-abbot, with an incised crosier lying upon it; also the\r\ngravestone, of Mr. ‘Jessy,’ ‘who, by his great courage, innoculated his\r\nwife and two sons from the (cow)’--_sic._ He rode up to London with\r\nsaddle-bags to give his experience to the Government. The Dorsetshire\r\nhere is pure Anglo-Saxon: King Alfred spoke Dorsetshire. The people are\r\nvery long-lived; at Steeple in Purbeck there have only been four rectors\r\nsince the time of Charles I. Three Messrs. Bond have lasted 160 years,\r\nand an old Mrs. Ross of 101 drives up this hill in a dogcart to visit\r\nher old servant of ninety-four in the village. In church the clerk said\r\n‘Stand in a wee (awe) and sin not!’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ LOUISA, MARCHIONESS OF WATERFORD.\r\n\r\n“_Cadland, Sept. 21._--This comfortable house stands in a park, which is\r\na piece of enclosed forest full of noble oaks and hollies, with glints\r\nof blue sea and shipping between. The passages are entirely clothed with\r\nfine prints and drawings, and in the rooms are many fine portraits,\r\nespecially that by Zoffany of the Drummond who founded the Bank. The\r\ncollection of autographs is priceless, and includes many by early kings\r\nof France, letters of Marie Antoinette, a charming one of the little\r\nDauphin, and the execution-warrant of Madame du Barry. Amongst the\r\ndrawings is the touching sketch which Severn made ‘to keep himself\r\nawake’ sitting by the death-bed of Keats.... We have driven to ‘the\r\nCottage,’ a charming house where Lady Elizabeth Drummond lived, in woods\r\nof ilex and fir above the Solent.... The company has included Valletort;\r\nHarry Forster, a very good-looking fellow; Robert Scott, Lord Montagu’s\r\nsecond son; and Christopher Walsh, a very nice son of Lord Ormathwayte.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Malshanger, Sept. 25._--I came here on the 22nd to visit Mr. Wyndham\r\nPortal, and (in her grandmotherhood) his most beautiful as well as\r\ncharming wife. After luncheon we drove to the Vyne, admirable in the\r\nrich colour of its old red brick and grey copings, and greatly beloved\r\nby Horace Walpole, who used to stay there with his friend John Chute, to\r\nwhom he gave many pictures, and whose ‘Chutehood’--depression of spirits\r\nand gout--he often deplored. It was to him that Gray wrote ‘suavissime\r\nChuti.’ The house has always been cared for and never allowed to ‘run\r\ndown,’ and there is much of interest in its fine old rooms, especially\r\nin its two stories of ‘gallery,’ lined with busts and portraits. Four of\r\nthese were brought hither by Lady Dacre of Hurstmonceaux, upon her\r\nsecond marriage with Challoner Chute of the Vyne, and include a portrait\r\nof Chrysogona Baker, afterwards Lady Dacre; of the widow of the Lord\r\nDacre who was executed, with his picture hanging behind her, and two of\r\nthe Chute Lady Dacre herself, one of them copied from a picture now at\r\nBelhus, the place of the Lennards. The present owner of the Vyne, who\r\nmarried Miss Eleanor Portal, showed it all admirably, and has written a\r\ncapital book on the place.[480] He educates his own beautiful boys,\r\nmaking scholars of them before they are ten years old.\r\n\r\n“This district--‘Portalia,’ as people call it--is quite peopled with\r\nPortals and their connections. They were a French Protestant family,\r\ngreatly persecuted under Louis XIV., when they took refuge at La\r\nCavalerie in the Larzac. Jean François de Portal escaped to Holland, and\r\nhis eight children, concealed in barrels and smuggled out of the kingdom\r\nby faithful nurses, reached England. The eldest of these became tutor to\r\nGeorge III., and the second, Henri, obtained the monopoly of the\r\nmanufacture of bank-notes, which the family have enjoyed ever since. The\r\nlast Portal left his vast landed estates to his eldest son, Melville,\r\nand his mills to his second son, Wyndham: now the land is only a burden,\r\nbut, police-guarded, the mills at Laverstoke constantly increase in\r\nvalue, and turn out daily 50,000 Bank of England notes, 12,000 Indian\r\nnotes, and 100,000 postal orders. By the process of one beautiful\r\nmachine, the linen rags (nothing but new rags of the best linen being\r\nused) are reduced to pulp, the pulp is flattened into paper, stamped,\r\ndrained, dried, and behold! before it leaves the machine, a bank-note\r\nready for the printer. All the machinery is turned by the transparent\r\nTeste, which is full of trout almost up to its source. The workmen, who\r\nlive in comfortable cottages near the mills and receive high wages, are\r\nhereditary, and always fulfil their quota of duty from father to son.\r\nMr. Portal throws open his fine gardens here every Saturday to the\r\npeople of Basingstoke, who play tennis and generally enjoy themselves,\r\nand do no harm whatever.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL AND LETTERS TO MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Ford Castle, Northumberland, Nov. 23._--I set out to come here on\r\nWednesday evening, after attending Miss Higginson’s wedding at Marlow.\r\nWhen we--two other guests, Mr. and Mrs. Bellairs, and I--reached the\r\ndesolate station amongst the bleak moorlands, we found only one little\r\ngig in waiting, and no chance of anything else. Mrs. B. and I struggled\r\ninto it, and came through the howling raging storm for seven miles here;\r\nMr. B. walked; but our reception in these fine old rooms made us forget\r\nall else, and to-day has been like all days at Ford and\r\nHighcliffe--drawing, reading aloud with talking at intervals, and walks\r\nin the glen and gardens.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 26._--A delightful walk, combating with the wind, to the Devil’s\r\nrocks, ‘where,’ say the Northumbrians, ‘the devil hanged his\r\ngrandmother.’ Mr. Neville (the rector) dined. He says the old rectory\r\nhere was haunted. His sister came to stay with him in the spare room\r\nthat looked out on the castle. The second day she said very quietly but\r\nfirmly that she could not sleep in that room again; another must be\r\ngiven her or she must leave. Then she described that, on two successive\r\nnights, the curtain of her bed had been drawn, and a strange voice had\r\ndistinctly said to her, ‘This is not a spare room.’\r\n\r\n“Mr. Neville said--\r\n\r\n“‘I belong to the Neville-Rolfes of Hitcham in Norfolk. After my cousin,\r\nCharles Neville-Rolfe, who was beloved by every one, died, his boxes\r\nwere all found to be fastened with letter-locks, and the family were a\r\nlong time before they were able to get them undone, as he had not left\r\nthe clue. My cousins suggested to me afterwards that I should ask Crisp\r\nthe carpenter how he had discovered it at last; so, as I was rubbing an\r\ninscription on a stone in the church, I got him to come and move part of\r\na pew which covered it, and I asked him about it. He said, “Whilst we\r\nwere puzzling over those locks, I heard in a dream the voice of Mr.\r\nCharles, and he said, ‘Crisp, come and walk and talk,’ and I said, ‘Yes,\r\nsir, gladly;’ and then he turned to me and said, ‘Crisp, guess!’--and I\r\nwoke, and ‘guess’ was the word we wanted.” I told my cousins afterwards\r\nwhat Crisp had told me, and they said, “Yes, but the really curious part\r\nwas that only three letters were wanted. Crisp thought ‘guess’ was spelt\r\n‘ges,’ still we acted on what he said, and it was right.’”\r\n\r\n“Lady Waterford says--‘My maid is very good, very good: her only fault\r\nis that she has three hands, she has a right hand and a left hand, and a\r\nlittle behind-hand.’\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bellairs, the Highcliffe agent, who is here, said--\r\n\r\n“‘My grandfather was both at Trafalgar and Waterloo, for he was wounded\r\nas a middy at Trafalgar, and then went into the army. It was odd when,\r\nlong afterwards, some one said about Trafalgar, “It was so and so” and\r\nhe said, “No, it was not, for _I_ was there,” and that the conversation\r\nthen went on to Waterloo, “It was so and so.”--“No, I beg your pardon,\r\nbut I was _there_.”\r\n\r\n“‘Afterwards he fell in love with Miss Mackenzie, one of two heiress\r\nsisters. He had nothing to marry upon, and the father forbade him the\r\nhouse, but he was allowed one interview, and in that he found out that\r\nthe butler was just leaving, and the family would be wanting another. He\r\ndressed up and came and applied for the place. He got it, and it was\r\nthree weeks before he was found out, and then Mr. Mackenzie allowed that\r\nhe was too much for him, and allowed that he should marry his daughter.\r\nBut he insisted that my grandfather should leave the army. “Very well,”\r\nhe said, “if you like I will go into the Church.” So that was agreed to,\r\nand in time he became a Canon. He was as earnest in the Church as\r\neverywhere else. Soon after his appointment to a country living, as he\r\nwas crossing some fields on a Sunday, he found a number of miners\r\ncrowding round some prize-fighters. “Come,” he said, “I can’t have this:\r\nI shall not allow this.” “But you can’t prevent it,” they cried. “Can’t\r\nprevent it! you’ll soon see if I can’t fight for my God as well as for\r\nmy king: I’ll fight you all in turn,” and he polished off the two\r\nstrongest miners in fair fight, and then the others were so pleased,\r\nthey chaired him, and carried him through the village to his church,\r\nwhich they filled from that time forward.’\r\n\r\n“Most delightful and full of holiest teaching have been the many quiet\r\nhours I have spent with the lady of the castle. There is a sentence of\r\nConfucius which says--‘If you would escape vexation, reprove yourself\r\nliberally and others sparingly.’ It is exactly her case. And there is\r\nanother sentence of Confucius which applies to her--‘The wise have no\r\ndoubts, the virtuous no sorrows, the brave no fears.’ Being here so\r\nquietly, I have seen even more of her than on other visits, and more\r\nthan ever has she seemed to be a fountain of original, interesting,\r\nnoble, and elevating words and thoughts. She is wonderfully well now,\r\nand able to walk, and take all her old energetic interest in the place\r\nand people, and oh! how we have talked!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Littlecote, Wilts, Dec. 3._--A charming visit to this beautiful old\r\nhouse, which mostly dates from Henry VII., and has a noble hall hung\r\nwith armour and the yellow jerkins of the Commonwealth, a long gallery\r\nfilled with fine Popham portraits, and a charming old pleasaunce with\r\nbowling-green and long grass walks. I sleep in the ghost-room, and just\r\noutside my door is the ante-chapel where Wild Darrell roasted the baby\r\nas described in the notes to ‘Rokeby,’ but the grandfather of the\r\npresent possessor was so bored by inquiring visitors that he burnt the\r\nold hangings of the bed by which the nurse identified the room of the\r\ncrime, and the bed itself, with much other old furniture, was sold to\r\nprovide the fortunes of the younger children in the present generation.\r\nNothing can be more delightfully comfortable, however, than the house as\r\nit now is, and my young host--Frank Popham--is most pleasant and genial.\r\nIt has been a great pleasure to find Lady Sherborne domesticated here,\r\nand to listen once more on a Sunday evening to her exquisite singing of\r\n‘Oh rest in the Lord’--so delicate and touching in its faintly vanishing\r\ncadences as to draw tears from her audience. Very pleasant too has it\r\nbeen to meet charming Mrs. Howard of Greystoke and her daughter again.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 11._--My old cousins, Mr. and Mrs. Thurlow, who had often invited\r\nme before to their house of Baynards, wrote that this week was my last\r\nchance of going, as Baynards was just sold, so I have been for one\r\nnight. The house is partly modern, but the place was an ancient royal\r\nresidence, and was part of the dower of Katherine Parr. A pretty statue\r\nof Edward VI. was discovered there walled up, and Margaret Roper lived\r\nthere afterwards, and long kept her father’s head in a box, which still\r\nexists at the foot of the staircase. There are also numbers of fine\r\nportraits, the dressing-box and travelling trunk of Elizabeth, and I\r\nslept in a magnificent old tapestried room and in Henry VIII.’s bed.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Thurlow says that Cardinal Wiseman went to dine with some friends\r\nof hers. It was a Friday, but they had quite forgotten to provide a\r\nfast-day dinner. However, he was quite equal to the occasion, for he\r\nstretched out his hands in benediction over the table and said, ‘I\r\npronounce all this to be fish,’ and forthwith enjoyed all the good\r\nthings heartily.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 12._--Henry Lyte says that Porson was told to write a Latin theme\r\nas to whether Brutus did well or not in killing Cæsar--‘Si bene fecit\r\naut male fecit.’ He wrote--‘Non bene fecit, nee male fecit, sed\r\ninterfecit.’\r\n\r\n“The Stuart Exhibition is most indescribably interesting. A glorious\r\nVandyke hangs there representing Henrietta Maria in radiant youth and\r\nhappiness, with husband and children. Close by hangs the most touching\r\nportrait in the gallery--Henrietta Maria, the same person exactly, with\r\nthe same curls, only grey, the same features sunken and worn by sorrow,\r\nin her old age at Chaillot, by Le Fevre.”[481]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Cobham, Jan. 3, 1889._--Drove with Lady Kathleen Bligh, Lady Mary, and\r\nLady Lurgan to Rochester to see the interesting old hospice for ‘six\r\npoor travellers, not rogues or proctors,’ where that number are still\r\ndaily received and cared for. They are given half a loaf, boiled beef,\r\nand porter for supper, have six small clean comfortable rooms lighted by\r\na street gas-lamp outside, and are sent away with fourpence each in the\r\nmorning. On Christmas Day a lady sends the travellers of the day some\r\ntobacco, a pipe, and a sixpence each, and quaint are their letters of\r\nthanks. ‘May you live for ever and a day after,’ was the good wish of\r\none of them this year.\r\n\r\n“Lord Darnley went himself into the village of Cobham to engage lodgings\r\nat a poor woman’s cottage for a man who wanted to come there. Lady\r\nKathleen went to see the poor woman afterwards, and found her greatly\r\ndelighted. ‘As soon as my Lord was gone,’ she said, ‘up I went to my\r\nroom, and down upon my knees I dropped to return thanks to the Almighty,\r\nbecause the Lord above, and the Lord below, were working together for my\r\ngood.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 10._--To tea with Mrs. Humphry Ward, almost a celebrity now as\r\nauthoress of ‘Robert Elsmere,’ at her house in Russell Square.

My cousin Florentia Hughes was at\r\nMentone with her youngest daughter, and we had many pleasant excursions\r\ntogether. In the hotel were Lord Northbrook and his daughter, with whom\r\nI dined several times, meeting the excessively entertaining Lord\r\nAlington and his pleasant daughters. On the 22nd I reached Rome, where\r\nI spent six weeks in the Hotel d’Italie, seeing many friends, correcting\r\nmy “Walks in Rome,” and drawing a great deal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PONT S.

Then they fetched\r\na black _pecorello_, and having tried to make it eat my paints, danced\r\nagain, the _pecorello_, held by a string, prancing behind them. Happily\r\nat last the cow which Amalia Maria was supposed to be chaperoning made\r\nits escape over a hedge, and whilst she was pursuing it over the\r\ncountry, I fled, and joined my companions at a little caffè, where we\r\nhad a delicious luncheon of excellent bread, hard-boiled eggs--painted\r\npurple for Lent--and sparkling Aleatico, for fourpence a head.\r\nAfterwards we sat to draw, looking down upon that loveliest of lakes and\r\nwoods full of cyclamens and anemones.\r\n\r\n“The crowds in the Roman galleries are endless. Whole families arrive\r\ntogether, every member of them carrying a campstool, and they will sit\r\ndown opposite each of the statues in turn, and move onwards gradually,\r\nwhilst the father reads aloud from a guidebook, and they all drink it\r\nin. He often begins the description at the wrong end, but they do not\r\nfind it out, and ... it does not signify! An American, a Mrs. Ruggles,\r\ncoming to the Apollo Belvidere, said, ‘Is _that_ the Apollo\r\nBelvidere?’--‘Yes, that’s the Apollo Belvidere.’--‘Well, then, if that’s\r\nthe Apollo Belvidere, I don’t think much of _him_: give me Ruggles.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_April 18._--Caught in tremendous rain and hail near a warehouse at the\r\nback of the Palatine, and took refuge under a rude porch with a number\r\nof peasants and was kept there an hour. One of the men described his\r\nlife as a soldier when his battalion was sent against the brigands near\r\nPescara. Of these, the famous Angelo Maria was so horrible a monster,\r\nthat his own mother determined to rid the world of such a fiend and to\r\ndeliver him up. He discovered this, seized his mother, laid her on a\r\ntable, ripped her up, and taking out her steaming heart--ate it! Words\r\ncannot describe the horrible gestures with which the peasant told this\r\nstory, or the dramatic power with which he described the sister seeing\r\nthe terrible scene through a chink in the door, and coming afterwards to\r\nthe guard-house, saying that she wished to betray her brother. ‘Oh,’\r\nsaid the officer, ‘you need not suppose that we trust you; this is a\r\ntrap you have laid for us.’--‘Yesterday,’ she answered, ‘I might have\r\nlaid a trap, but I had not then seen that monster eat my mother’s\r\nheart.’ And he was taken.\r\n\r\n“But Capolo Roscia was worse. He came one night to a _masseria_. The\r\ndoors were barred, but he forced his way in with his band. The head of\r\nthe farm hid himself in the straw, but he was found and dragged out.\r\nAll the men in the _masseria_, eighteen in number, were brought out and\r\nmade to sit in a row. ‘Now you must all be shaved,’ said Capolo Roscia,\r\nand he cut all their eighteen heads off and put them in a basket.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, in that time when we were brigand-hunting we did not stop much to\r\ninquire how far they were guilty. “A ginocchio: avete cinque minuti,” we\r\nshouted to a peasant if we caught him. “Oh, ma signori, signori!” he\r\nwould say. “A ginocchio! Un minuto, due, tre, cinque--bo-o-o-ah!” and he\r\nwas done for; for he had given the brigands provisions, and so he was as\r\nbad as themselves. Even with _i sindaci_, well, we often did the same;\r\nbut--we got rid of the brigands.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Easter Sunday, April 21._--To St. Peter’s. The service was under the\r\ndome, but the group around the shrine would not call up even a\r\nreminiscence of the glorious services under the Papacy. The relics were\r\nshown afterwards from a high gallery--the spear-head of Longinus, the\r\nbit of the true cross, the napkin of Veronica, to the sight of which\r\nseven thousand years’ indulgence is attached. I gazed hard, but could\r\nonly see its glittering frame, nor could any other member of the\r\ncongregation see any more.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN S.

I was at the Pension\r\nAnglaise, crowded with lively, kindly ultra-English people, whose\r\nmistakes were amusing. “Gesu-Maria!” suddenly exclaimed the gondolier on\r\nnarrowly escaping a concussion at a sharp corner. “Why on earth does he\r\nsay ‘Je suis marié’?” said a Mrs. R.

He is, however, preferred to his servants, who\r\ngive themselves endless airs, refusing the rooms prepared for them, &c.,\r\nand their hosts are afraid to complain of them to the Shah, for fear he\r\nshould cut off their heads! He is a true Eastern potentate in his\r\nconsideration for himself and himself only: is most unconcernedly late\r\nwhenever he chooses: utterly ignores every one he does not want to speak\r\nto: amuses himself with monkeyish and often dirty tricks: sacrifices a\r\ncock to the rising sun, and wipes his wet hands on the coat-tails of the\r\ngentleman next him without compunction. He expressed his wonder that\r\nLord Salisbury did not take a new wife, though he gave Lady Salisbury a\r\nmagnificent jewelled order. He knows no English and very few words of\r\nFrench, but when the Baroness Coutts, as the great benefactress of her\r\ncountry, was presented to him by the Prince of Wales, he looked in her\r\nface and exclaimed, ‘Quelle horreur!’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_July 22._--A wonderful speech (at the Aberdeens’) on Christian work\r\nfrom the Bishop of Ripon (Boyd Carpenter)--eloquent, elevating, touching\r\nbeyond description.

A\r\ndelicate haze softens the view of the distant sea, sprinkled over with\r\nvessels, and the castle-rock rises up pink-grey against it. Far\r\noverhead, the softest of white clouds float in the blue ether. In the\r\nmeadows, where the cows are ringing their Swiss bells, the old oak-trees\r\nare throwing long deep shadows across lawns of the most emerald green,\r\nand the flower-beds and the terrace borders are brimming with the most\r\nbrilliant flowers, over which whole battalions of butterflies and bees\r\nare floating and buzzing; the little pathlet at the side winds with\r\nenticing shadows under the beech-trees, whilst the white marble Venetian\r\nwell, covered with delicate sculpture of vines and pomegranates,\r\nstanding on the little grassy platform, makes a point of refinement\r\nwhich accentuates the whole. Selma steals lazily round the corner to see\r\nif she can catch a bird, but finds it quite too hot for the exertion;\r\nand Rollo raises himself now and then carelessly to snap at a fly. The\r\ndoves are cooing on the ledge of the roof, and the pigeons are\r\ncollecting on the smokeless chimneys. Upstairs Mrs. Whitford and Anne\r\nare dusting and laughing over their work, with the windows wide open\r\nabove the ivied verandah, and Rogers is planting out a box of\r\nsweet-scented tobacco-plants which has come by the post.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM THE WALKS, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n“Such is little Holmhurst on an August morning. You would be amused with\r\nmy hearing the other day that one of the servants had said, ‘Our\r\nmaster’s a gentleman as knows his place,’ which meant that I never find\r\nfault with an under-servant except through an upper, or cast even the\r\nfaintest shadow upon an upper-servant if an under-servant is present.\r\nAfter all, it is only another form of Landor’s observation--‘The spider\r\nis a gentleman, for he takes his fly in secret.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ LOUISA, MARCHIONESS OF WATERFORD.\r\n\r\n“_St. Michael’s Mount, Sept. 7, 1889._--This is a wonderful and\r\ndelightful place. It was nearly 10 P.M. when I reached the Marazion\r\nstation. The day had been very hot, and the evening lights and\r\nreflections perfectly lovely; but night had quite closed in. Lord St.\r\nLevan’s carriage met me at the station, and stopped at the head of a\r\nstaircase leading to the sea, where four sturdy boatmen took possession\r\nof me and my things, and rowed away on a waveless sea, following up the\r\nlong stream of brilliant light which fell from one of the upper windows\r\nof the castle on the sacred mount, grim and black in the still night. An\r\nold man with a lanthorn met me at the landing-place, and guided me up a\r\nsteep pathlet in the rocks. At the door a maid received me, for the\r\nfamily were all at dinner, but I found a pleasant meal ready for me in a\r\nsmall sitting-room, and then was ushered in to the large party--Lord and\r\nLady St. Levan, six daughters, a son, a niece--Lady Agnes Townshend,\r\nHugh Amherst, two Misses Tyssen Amherst, Mr. and Lady Harriet Cavendish,\r\nMiss Hill Trevor, Mr. Stewart, a young Manners, and Mrs. and Miss\r\nLowther. With the latter I have spent many pleasant mornings in drawing\r\non the rock (really improving greatly, I think, in knowledge of the\r\n‘how’ and ‘why’ of everything), whilst the whole family has gone out\r\nfishing, and most glorious are the subjects. Mrs. Lowther’s enthusiastic\r\nenergy makes her a first-rate companion. ‘Elle est au-dessus de l’ennui\r\net de l’oisiveté, deux vilaines bêtes,’ as Madame de Sévigné would have\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. MICHAEL’S MOUNT.]\r\n\r\n“It is a life apart. The chapel-bell rings at nine, and I always meet\r\nMrs. Lowther on the staircase hurrying up to the service, which is\r\nreached by an open-air walk at the top of everything. Then, before\r\nbreakfast in the ‘Chevy Chase Hall’ (surrounded by old stucco hunting\r\nscenes), we linger on the grand platform, looking down into the\r\nchrysoprase waves with sea-birds floating over them, and across to the\r\nmainland with its various bays, and its fleeting golden lights and\r\npurple shadows.\r\n\r\n“On Friday we went a long drive, passing St. Buryan’s, one of the three\r\nparishes of the Deanery of St. Levan. A Mr. Stanhope was long the rector\r\nhere, having also a rich living, where he resided, in Essex. At St.\r\nBuryan’s he kept a curate, to whom it was only necessary to give a very\r\nsmall stipend indeed, because he was--a harmless maniac! He used to be\r\nfastened to the altar-rail by a long chain, which allowed him to reach\r\neither the altar or the reading-desk. When once there, he was quite sane\r\nenough to go through the service perfectly! On week-day evenings he\r\nearned his subsistence by playing the fiddle at village taverns; but he\r\ncontinued to be the officiating clergyman of St. Buryan’s till his death\r\nin 1808.\r\n\r\n“This truly aquatic family bathe together from a raft at 7 A.M. most\r\nmornings. To-day they were all rowed in their scanty bathing costumes,\r\nlooking like Charon’s souls being ferried to purgatory, into the little\r\nport, and there (at twelve mid-day) one after the other took a header\r\ninto the sea, and swam--many of the guests with them--to the main-shore\r\nat Marazion, to the great astonishment of the natives on the beach\r\nthere. The parents followed or accompanied their mermaid-daughters in\r\nsafety-boats, but instead of being anxious about those who became\r\nexhausted, encouraged them to hold on. George Manners was almost choked\r\nby a butterfly flying down his throat, mistaking his head for an\r\nunexpected islet.\r\n\r\n“The place is beyond everything poetical: even I have been unable to\r\nrefrain from some verses, which I send you.\r\n\r\n    “Grey cloud-wreaths lovingly entwine,\r\n       And in their mystic maze enfold\r\n     The sacred Mount, which day’s decline\r\n       Shadowed upon a sheet of gold:\r\n     And faint and sweet, the surges beat\r\n       The burthen of the ancient lay,\r\n     Which low or loud, through mirk and cloud,\r\n       The Past bewails eternally.\r\n\r\n     But when the radiant morn awakes\r\n       To kiss fresh life into the flowers,\r\n     The windows beam, the turrets gleam,\r\n       The blue waves break in silver showers,\r\n     Tossing their glistening foam away\r\n       In merry riplets to the shore:\r\n     The Present reigns; the murmuring Past,\r\n       Though whispering still, is heard no more.\r\n\r\n     Serene, the great Archangel keeps\r\n       His vigil here on high,\r\n     Whilst in the changeful world below\r\n       Fleet life is fluttering by.\r\n     Through shine or shower, his silent power,\r\n       Unheard, unseen his sway,\r\n     Spirits of ill, which daunt or chill,\r\n       Shall drive rebuked away.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_St. Michael’s Mount, Sept. 7, 1889._--I have enjoyed my visit here\r\nextremely, and, difficult as it was to manage coming, it is more\r\ndifficult to get away, from the extreme kindness and genuine\r\nhospitality of Lord and Lady St. Levan, who would like one to stay\r\nmonths. I think I never saw such excellent people, or a happier, more\r\nunited family; and being very well off, their kindnesses to rich and\r\npoor cannot be calculated. Then it is indeed the most delightful of\r\nhomes, so healthy in its pure air of mingled sea and mountain\r\nexhilaration, so glorious in its views over land and water, with every\r\natmospheric effect which Nature, never the same, can paint upon both.\r\nLooking down from the ramparts into the deep clear chrysoprase water is\r\nin itself a delight, and watching the fish rising and leaping with\r\nsparkling showers, and the great white seagulls swooping down upon them.\r\nNo wonder the sons of the house, devoted to sport of every kind, think\r\nthere is nothing to compare to the fishing excursions round their home.\r\nBut there is unspeakable grandeur, too, when the sacred Mount is\r\nenveloped in sea-fog, shrouding it from all sign of the mainland and\r\neverything else, and when nothing is heard but the distant booming of\r\nthe waves far down below. This is the one great house of England, I\r\nsuppose, which is approached by no road whatever, for even the pathlet\r\nwhich winds among the cliffs and low wind-blown bushes of the island is\r\nlost where it crosses the turfy slopes which intervene here and there.\r\nThe castle is in seven stories (of which I inhabit the second); many of\r\nthe rooms are walled with rock, and in one of the narrow passages it is\r\nknown that a number of skeletons--naughty nuns, I suppose--are walled\r\nup. I never saw a place where so much of daily life was in the open\r\nair.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Sept. 19._--From the Mount I went to visit the Tremaynes in\r\nthe Vale of Tavistock. It was an exquisite still evening when I arrived\r\nat Sydenham, and it is a beautiful drive through a richly-wooded valley,\r\ntill a sharp turn brings one to the old bridge over the clear tossing\r\nLyd, on the other side of which rises the noble old manor-house, only\r\nseparated from the road by ‘the green court’ with a wrought iron gate.\r\nBy this gate, as I drove up, stood, with her daughter, Mrs. Tremayne,\r\nher exquisite profile, quite white, like a Greek gem, relieved against\r\nthe dark yew foliage: it is a picture that remains with one. We had tea\r\nin the old panelled hall, surrounded by four fine Chinese dogs.\r\n\r\n“It would be difficult to over-praise the sweet seclusion of the spot,\r\nthe constant merry ripple of the sparkling river, the deep shade of the\r\ntall trees, the old-fashioned gardens of splendid herbaceous flowers,\r\nthe charming old rooms and staircase, in which--even in this desolate\r\nplace--the two powdered footmen do not look out of keeping. But the\r\ngreat charm lies in the family itself--in the ever-genial, courteous,\r\nsweet-tempered father--the perfectly beautiful and dignified but simple\r\nmother--the daughters and the only son.\r\n\r\n“A relic in the house is the ‘tongue-token,’ only given during the Civil\r\nWars to the most faithful friends of the King and Queen,--a little gold\r\nmedal which could be concealed under the tongue. In this case it was\r\ngiven to the Tremayne of the day, because, at imminent risk to himself,\r\nhe rode to announce to the King at Oxford the birth of the Princess\r\nHenrietta at Exeter.\r\n\r\n“We went several excursions: to the fine old gateway of Bradstone; to\r\nthe Kellys of Kelly, who have a most admirable collection of Alpine\r\nplants, growing upon little but old mortar; to the Duke of Bedford’s\r\nhouse of Ensleigh, beautiful in hilly woods feathering down to a river;\r\nand to Launceston, a dull place, where the castle recalls that of\r\nGisors.\r\n\r\n“From Sydenham I went to see the Elphinstones[484] at their beautiful\r\nGovernment House at Plymouth, and on the same evening to Whiteway, where\r\nI paid a delightful visit to the dear Dowager Lady Morley, who is still\r\nas genially kind and as sharply truth-exacting as ever. It was comically\r\ncharacteristic that when the foolish Bishop of Exeter (Bickersteth) came\r\nover to Whiteway, Lady Morley, with innocent pride, showed him the\r\nimprovements she had made. ‘You should not take a sinful pride in your\r\npossessions,’ said the Bishop; ‘_all_ God’s works are beautiful, and all\r\nthese are the works of God.’--‘That is all very well,’ answered Lady\r\nMorley, ‘but _I_ made this walk.’ It was sad to see Lady Katherine, the\r\ncompanion of many happy mountain excursions long ago, laid up as a\r\npermanent invalid; but she is indescribably brave and cheerful.\r\n\r\n“A child at Whiteway, being asked where the eggs were laid, answered,\r\n‘On an average.’--‘What do you mean? who told you so?’--‘Father; he said\r\nthe hens laid, on an average, twenty eggs a day.’\r\n\r\n“With the Lowthers and Listers we one day met the Halifaxes and their\r\ntwo eldest children at Bovey, and we all went a delightful excursion\r\nover Dartmoor to several of the great tors, which rise above the russet\r\nwastes of moor, like castles in the south of France, and to Tecket\r\nFalls, near which Lord Devon has a cottage. Hence, after ascending\r\nthrough the mazes of a wood, Charlie H. insisted on our being taken\r\nblindfold till we reached ‘Exclamation Point,’ where the present\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury had fallen on his knees from the beauty of the\r\nview. We did not return till eight, when the Halifaxes stayed to dine,\r\nand went home at eleven, walking miles over the moors by night in true\r\nCharlie Halifax fashion.\r\n\r\n“Endless was the amusing talk of Devonshire quaintnesses. ‘How did you\r\nbreak your arm?’ said Lady Katherine to an old woman. ‘Well, ‘twere all\r\nalong of gathering apples; ‘twere first the apples and then the fall: I\r\nwere like Eve, I reckon.’ ‘Blow your nose,’ she said to a child. ‘Yes,\r\nmum, but her won’t bide blowed.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ LOUISA, MARCHIONESS OF WATERFORD.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Nov. 1889._--I have been far too long without writing, life\r\nripples by so quickly: it seems every day more different from the years\r\nbefore I was grown up, when all was so long.... My ‘outing’ to the North\r\nwas very enjoyable. I was nearly a week at Tatton, where the host and\r\nhostess were boundlessly kind. The party there had admirable\r\nelements--Lord Savile, Lord and Lady Knutsford, Lord and Lady Jersey,\r\nLord and Lady Waldegrave, Lord and Lady Amherst, Sir Redvers and Lady\r\nAudrey Buller, Mr. and Mrs. Piers Warburton, Mrs. Percy Mitford, Mrs.\r\nLegh of Lyme, Sir Charles Grant, and Dick Bagot. We were all taken to\r\nsee the Ship Canal in a royal way, with special trains, luncheon sent\r\non, and tea at the mouth of the Canal in ‘Bridgewater House,’ where the\r\nold Duke of Bridgewater spent his later years, and where his picture\r\nstill presides in the seldom-used dining-room.\r\n\r\n“I left with Mrs. Legh, whose ponies met us at the Disley station, and\r\ntook us a wild drive over moor and fen, rock and fell--a drive of\r\nglorious views, but no road whatever--before returning to Lyme. Lady\r\nLovelace came in the evening and was most agreeable, especially in her\r\nreminiscences of India and Lady Canning. With her and Mrs. Legh I went\r\nto draw the old hall at Marple, an interesting house of the Usherwoods,\r\nwho inherited it from the Bradshaws: the regicide’s chamber has its\r\noriginal furniture and tapestry.\r\n\r\n“Next, I went to Ingmire, a fine old place of Mrs. Upton\r\nCottrell-Dormer, beautifully situated amongst the Westmoreland fells,\r\nthough geographically in Yorkshire. John Way, the vicar of Henbury, was\r\nthere, who said that when the boys in his school were reading of\r\nJezebel, how she ‘painted her face, tired her head,’ &c., he asked, ‘Why\r\ndo you suppose she did that?’--‘She wanted to get married,’ promptly\r\nanswered a boy--true, probably, too. He described how his\r\ngreat-grandfather, Sir Roger Hill, and his son lay dying at Denham at\r\nthe same time. It was of the most vital importance to the son’s wife to\r\nkeep her husband alive beyond his father, just sufficient time to\r\nenable him to sign a will, and this she did by killing one pigeon after\r\nanother, keeping his feet immersed in the body of the hot steaming bird,\r\nand, as soon as it chilled, changing it for another. The pigeons\r\nconquered, and the Hedgeley property was left away to the son’s widow.\r\nThe Denham property went to the daughter, Mrs. Lockey, whose daughter\r\nAbigail married Mr. Way, and was mother of Benjamin Way and Lady\r\nSheffield.\r\n\r\n“From Ingmire I went to Muncaster, which I thought even more beautiful\r\nand delightful than before. With Lady Muncaster and Lady Kilmarnock I\r\nhad one lovely day at Wastwater--glorious in the last coruscations of\r\nNature. The Bishop of Carlisle had just been at Muncaster, who said that\r\na boy in a Board-school examination, being asked one of the foolish\r\nCatechism questions of ‘Why is a boy baptized when by reason of his\r\ntender age?’ &c., wrote, ‘Why indeed?’\r\n\r\n“Another child in a higher class, being asked to define faith, said it\r\nwas ‘the power of believing absolutely what was utterly incredible.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Bramfield House, Hertford, Nov. 27, 1889._--Lady Bloomfield is very\r\ncomfortably established here in a good house of Abel Smith’s, near a\r\npretty little church and village, and in the midst of the amiable Smith\r\ncolony. She finds no end of good works to do, and really is beyond\r\nmeasure kind, in addition to a thousand other unostentatious goodnesses,\r\nin filling her extra rooms with homeless and feeble gentlefolk needing\r\nhelp, kindness, and temporary home. We went through Panshanger\r\nyesterday, but I do not admire this cabbage-tree district, all so\r\nprosperously unpicturesque.\r\n\r\n“You must buy, you really must, ‘John Smith on Church Reform.’ It is by\r\nno means the dull book it sounds. You will delight in it, and will\r\npresent it to Mr. Neville, as I shall to our little clergyman, who is\r\nbecoming quite as like naughty Rome as he dares, but is a good little\r\nman all the same.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn quoting so constantly from journal and letters, I do not think I have\r\nmentioned how much poverty had been pressing upon me in the last few\r\nyears. Not only had Messrs. Daldy and Virtue, representing my first\r\npublishers, ceased to pay even the interest of their large debt, or paid\r\nit most irregularly, but under my second set of publishers I had made\r\n_nothing whatever_ during the seven years I had been with them. Their\r\naccounts showed that 28,000 of my books had been sold in the time, but\r\nthe innumerable percentages, &c., had swallowed up the whole of the\r\nprofits, leaving me nothing but the loss of money expended on woodcuts,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n    “’Tis a very good world that we live in,\r\n      To lend, or to spend, or to give in;\r\n      But to beg or to borrow, or get a man’s own,\r\n     ’Tis the very worst world that ever was known.”\r\n\r\nWhilst I was at Muncaster, however, Mrs. Arthur Severn came to the\r\ncastle, and told me how Mr. Ruskin also had made nothing by his books in\r\nthe hands of my then publishers, but that they had brought him in a good\r\nincome since they were removed to the hands of Mr. Allen of Orpington.\r\nTo his hands, therefore, I soon after removed all my books. I had no\r\ncomplaint of unfairness to make against those I had lately employed;\r\nthey only acted according to their agreements and their usual method,\r\nwhich I had long hoped against hope might eventually result to my\r\nadvantage: and they behaved very handsomely about parting with the\r\nbooks, though it must have been both a loss and disappointment to them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ LOUISA, MARCHIONESS OF WATERFORD.\r\n\r\n“_Campsea Ashe High House, Dec. 27, 1889._--We have had a very pleasant\r\nmerry week in this most kindly and happy of family homes, not going out\r\nmuch, but the days full of intellectual interest, the evenings of games,\r\nacting, &c. The party has been the two really charming Miss Farquhars,\r\ntheir brother Ernest, pretty, attractive Miss Theresa Lister, Lady\r\nCecily Clifton, Captain Sydney, Kenneth and Miss Matheson, James\r\nLowther, young Brooke--a pleasant clever little county magnate,\r\ndelightful Jack Cator and his remarkably nice sister, a young Macgregor\r\nin the Guards, and to-day the Anstruther Thompsons, the Edmund Fanes,\r\nMiss Mullholland, and a young Burroughs have come. Last night we acted a\r\nplay, ‘The Bilious Husband,’ before a large audience of neighbours. Can\r\nyou fancy me as Captain Marmaduke Mynch of the Royal Berkshire Plungers?\r\nThen there was ‘Barnum’s Show’--Miss Matheson as a mermaid, myself as a\r\ndwarf, Miss Lowther as the tattooed woman, Miss Farquhar the fat woman,\r\nBrooke a Zulu, Ernest Farquhar an Arab, and Mr. Lowther as ‘The Bearded\r\nLady!’ Another day I dressed up and came in as an old aunt of the\r\nfamily--being the first scene of the word _Antidote_, for which we made\r\na little story. I have liked my frivolous week very much, but it is\r\nenough, and I shall be glad to go back to my solitary work at Holmhurst\r\non Monday.\r\n\r\n“Kenneth Matheson very kindly said, ‘I know you will consider it\r\nsacrilege my pressing you to come to Highcliffe whilst I am its\r\ntenant’--which I allowed to be the case!\r\n\r\n“I was very glad to hear of Lady Ossington’s will--just like an echo\r\nfrom the generosity, justice, and beneficence of her life.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom Christmas 1889-90 people were already beginning to talk a great\r\ndeal about the “Influenza epidemic” which was spreading over Europe, and\r\nwas like a malarial fever. I was in London for a few hours on January\r\n11, and bringing it back to Holmhurst with me, was very ill for nearly\r\na month, but with the comfort of being in my own home, and, to me, the\r\ngreat comfort of being alone. In illness I quite feel the extreme\r\nblessing of religion--not the religion worried and touzled by a thousand\r\nmillion vagaries of personality, but the simple main facts, in which I\r\nbelieve so fully. I find some lines of Elizabeth Trench which exactly\r\nexpress what I feel myself:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    “Lord, I believe not yet as fain I would;\r\n     Dimly Thy dealings have I understood:\r\n     Thy word and message yet to me have brought\r\n     Only a shadow of Thy wondrous thought.\r\n\r\n     Fain would I follow on to know thee, Lord,\r\n     Fain learn the meaning of Thy every word;\r\n     Truth would I know--the truth that dwells in Thee,\r\n     Setting the lowest heart from doubting free.\r\n\r\n     Lord, I believe! oh fan this trembling spark,\r\n     Lest all my hope be lost in endless dark;\r\n     And where I yet believe not, lead Thou me,\r\n     And help my unbelief, which seeks for Thee.”\r\n\r\n“When all fails, and to stand firm seems impossible, stand on the wood\r\nof the Cross; it will float with you,” said Queen Marie Leczinska.\r\n\r\n“The Mercy of God--_all_ is included in that word Mercy,” was a saying\r\nof the Mère Angelique.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYet I find it very difficult to endure any other religious book than the\r\nBible itself: all are so self-asserting, so self-seeking; and hymns,\r\nwith one or two sublime exceptions, are either abjectly foolish or full\r\nof the self, even if it be the religious self, of man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 13, 1890._--In December my old servant Joe Cornford died, who had\r\nbeen all my lifetime in the family service. For several years he had\r\nbeen too old and infirm to do any work, but, when he was well enough, he\r\nmade a pretence of picking up a leaf or two, and received his wages all\r\nthe same. If it had not been for his grumbling old wife, it would have\r\nbeen a pleasure to see him slowly dragging himself about the walks, but\r\nher temper was a trial! He was worse for some time. One day I went in to\r\nthe lodge to see him after breakfast, and at that moment he suddenly\r\ndied! Again, as often before, I felt the wonderful power of the great\r\nmystery of death, actually seeing life ebb downwards: the forehead\r\nbecome white and waxen, then the cheeks, then the whole being. How I was\r\nreminded of the lines of Caroline Bowles (Mrs. Southey):--\r\n\r\n    ‘Oh change, oh wondrous change!\r\n       Burst are the prison bars,\r\n     This moment there so low,\r\n     So agonized, and now\r\n       Beyond the stars!\r\n\r\n     Oh change, stupendous change!\r\n       There lies the soulless clod;\r\n     The sun eternal breaks,\r\n     The new immortal wakes--\r\n       Wakes with his God.’\r\n\r\n“I was at his funeral some days afterwards, the poor old man carried to\r\nthe grave by our workmen, and followed by seventeen of his descendants,\r\nchildren and grandchildren. He has left me a chair which came out of\r\nHurstmonceaux Castle.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 26, 1890._--Went to see Lady De Ros,[485] aged ninety-five. She\r\nbrought out for me her greatest treasure, a beautifully printed Church\r\nof England Prayer-book in Spanish. It belonged to the great Duke of\r\nOrmonde, and descended from him to Lady Eleanor Butler, by whom and Miss\r\nPonsonby--‘ladies of Llangollen’--it was given to the Duke of Wellington\r\nas a boy. He taught himself Spanish by following its services, as he\r\nhimself says in an inscription on the fly-leaf. In his old age, when\r\nLady De Ros was with him at Strathfieldsaye, she found it in the\r\nlibrary, and told him what a valuable book she thought it. ‘Then, if you\r\nthink it such a valuable thing, I will give it you, my dear.’--‘So, as\r\nDouro and Charles were just coming, I took my book away at once,’ said\r\nLady De Ros, ‘for fear they should stop me.’ Some years afterwards the\r\nDuke asked Lady De Ros to lend him the book to show to some great\r\nlibrarian. She let it go, but made it a condition that, before it was\r\nreturned, the Duke should write its history in the book with his own\r\nhands; and this he did.\r\n\r\n“Lady De Ros also showed me a brush of hogs’-bristles, mounted in ebony,\r\nand with a silver plate. And she told how, when she was hunting wild\r\nboars with the Duke on Mont St. Jean near Cambrai, an immense boar\r\nsprang out of the thicket close by her. The Duke speared it. It was a\r\nhorrid sight and she shrank from it. ‘Oh, my dear,’ said the Duke, ‘you\r\nmust not mind it, for I am prouder of having killed that boar than of\r\nthe battle of Waterloo.’\r\n\r\n“Lady De Ros was very full of her dispute with Sir William Fraser about\r\nthe house in which the ball was given at Brussels by her father, the\r\nDuke of Richmond, on the eve of the battle of Waterloo. She was quite\r\ncertain of her facts, and that the house was now gone. She had been\r\nliving in the house itself, in the Rue de la Blanchisserie (‘where the\r\nDuke would direct to me “in the wash-house“‘), and cited as a proof that\r\nthe ball was given in her own house, the fact that her youngest sister,\r\nwho had been sent to bed, stole out, and watched the company arrive\r\nthrough the banisters. ‘I believe Sir William Fraser asserts,’ said Lady\r\nDe Ros, ‘that I am confused and doting now through my great age, but you\r\nknow very old people remember the long-ago as if it was to-day, and that\r\nis the case with me. In 1860 I went back to see Brussels, and I could\r\nnot find our house then; the whole street was swept away. At last, as I\r\nwas walking up and down, I was attracted by the name on a pastry-cook’s\r\nshop: it was a name I remembered in that long-ago time. So I went in and\r\nasked if they knew anything of our house. “Oh, a house in the Rue de la\r\nBlanchisserie,” they said; “it has been pulled down years and years\r\nago.”’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\nAT HOME AND ABROAD\r\n\r\n     “Le monde n’est éternel pour personne; laisse le passer, et\r\n     t’attache à celui qui l’a fait.”--DIDEROT, “_Sarrasins_.”\r\n\r\n    “Time there was, but it is gone;\r\n       Time there may be--who can tell?\r\n     Time there is to act upon,\r\n       Help me, Lord, to use it well.”\r\n           --LADY WATERFORD’S _Note-Book_.\r\n\r\n    “Non aver tema, disse il mio Signore:\r\n     Fatti sicuro, chè noi siamo a buon punto:\r\n     Non stringer, ma rallarga ogni vigore.”\r\n           --DANTE, “_Purgatorio_,” Canto ix.\r\n\r\n     “I hope the hereafter will not lack something to remind us of the\r\n     beautiful earth-life--beautiful in spite of its sin and\r\n     sorrow.”--WHITTIER’S _Letters_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen my friend George Jolliffe had passed his diplomatic examination, I\r\npromised him that I would go out and pay him a month’s visit wherever he\r\nwas sent to. Thus I came to set out for Constantinople on April 10,\r\n1890. The faithful Hugh Bryans went with me. At Vienna I spent several\r\ndays with the Lützows, who showed me the sights in the most agreeable\r\nway. The town was full of grand-dukes or exiled princes--Cumberland,\r\nParma, Tuscany, &c., all very rich and adding to its prosperity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_British Embassy, Constantinople, April 22, 1890._--We came straight\r\nthrough from Vienna, through the strange unknown country. There were\r\nvast plains of corn till Belgrade, a poor town hanging shaggy on the\r\nhillside: then we entered low wooded hills like the Sabina. In the\r\nServian villages of rude huts and ruder fences we could see the swarming\r\npeople, men and women in loose folds of white linen, the former with the\r\nair of princes. All seemed remote and unreal, and the shadows, as in\r\nSyrian clearness, fell pure blue upon the dusty hills. By the second\r\nmorning we were passing through Roumelia. All had become poorer. The\r\nvillages, of wretched huts, stood in wattled enclosures of thorns,\r\ninside which all the domestic animals are driven. Now, the men were seen\r\nin crimson and green, with magnificent mahogany-coloured faces beneath\r\ntheir turbans, and the women, all closely veiled, moved like masses of\r\ndark drapery; a little mosque appeared, with a delicate and refined\r\nminaret; a little fountain-cistern with a gothic arch in a grove of\r\nthorns; marshes with storks; plains with buffaloes.\r\n\r\n“About 3 P.M. the lovely Sea of Marmora gleamed upon the right, with a\r\nvariety of inlet bays of solitary beauty, and, in the distance, the\r\naërial mountains of Asia. Then a succession of battlemented towers rose\r\non the left from the untrodden plain--the walls of Stamboul! Through\r\nthese the train passes. We were far from the station still, but what a\r\nchange from our two days’ desolation! We rushed across many shabby\r\ncourts, paved either with mud or rough stones. The old houses, with\r\ntheir projecting lattices, were veiled in a web of flowering wistaria,\r\nand shaded by pink Judas-trees in fullest bloom. Then above us rose the\r\nmosques with their slender minarets and huge storm-blasted cypresses.\r\nSt. Sophia itself, Achmet, Suleiman, Mahmoud were passed, with many a\r\nstrange gothic fountain or decorated cistern, before we reached the\r\nshed-like station, where George was a most welcome sight, armed with an\r\nEmbassy cavass to extricate us from the mass of yelping, screaming\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\n“Off we went across the creaking, rocking, timber bridge over the Golden\r\nHorn, thronged by the strangest of multitudes. Then up the steep street\r\nof Galata, where the lattices project till they almost obliterate the\r\nsky, and the pavement is made of rough stones set edgeways, up which the\r\nhorses scrambled like cats. A road succeeded, a dusty deep-rutted track,\r\noverlooking an old burial-ground without barriers, where, amid the\r\nimmemorial cypresses, thousands of battered tombstones remain,\r\nneglected, ruined, but never wilfully destroyed; and so we reached the\r\nhandsome palace of the Embassy, with its delightful garden, overlooking\r\nthe valley of the Golden Horn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CEMETERY OF PERA, CONSTANTINOPLE.]\r\n\r\n“I have been here two days now, and cannot say how delightful I find it\r\nto be with George, with whom every thought may be exchanged. I live in\r\nthe room of an absent attaché, and the life is like that of a college.\r\nUnfortunately, on the first afternoon I caught a dreadful chill in the\r\nboat, and have been very ill ever since, though I dragged myself out\r\nyesterday to take advantage of a rarely procured permit to see the\r\nfamous church of St. Irene, where the Council of Constantinople was\r\nheld, and where the Christian emperors, Constantine, Arcadius, &c.,\r\nrepose, some of them in grand porphyry sarcophagi. I went with two\r\nclergymen, friends of Arthur Stanley, Canon Farrar of Durham, and Dr.\r\nLivingstone, who had been to every other scene of a General Council:\r\nthis was the last!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_April 27._--I have been suffering terribly from rheumatic fever, but\r\nam better to-day, and have been to St. Sophia. The carriage stopped at\r\nan obscure door on the N.W., where the cavass took off his boots and\r\nfetched some of the Turkish guardians of holiness, who, for a very large\r\nconsideration of baksheesh, put slippers over ours. Then we passed the\r\ncurtain, and found ourselves at once at the northern extremity of the\r\ngreat western narthex, like that of St. Mark’s at Venice on a huge\r\nscale, and--almost immediately--from a side-door, in the church itself.\r\n\r\n“It is so unspeakably, overwhelmingly, indescribably, entrancingly,\r\nbewilderingly glorious, words can give no idea of it.\r\n\r\n“Of the immense space--a St. Mark’s lifted into the heavens, soaring far\r\nabove in the mystic involutions of its entwining arches and the delicate\r\nnuances of its grey-golden colouring, never sufficiently defined to be\r\nobtrusive in any special point, only melting and harmonising into a\r\nwhole as tender and glorious as the hues on a dove’s back. So also in\r\nthe architectural details; all the walls, all the chapels are filled\r\nwith the most exquisite and graceful sculptured ornament, but the grand\r\nimpression of space is never lessened by any single object leaving its\r\nown identity upon the vision, till the gaze rests far above upon the\r\npendentives of the mightiest dome, where float the four huge prophetic\r\nseraphim[486] with their many wings folded in repose--with twain they\r\ncovered their breasts, with twain they covered their feet, and with\r\ntwain they did fly.\r\n\r\n“Close to the entrance was a vast fountain gurgling, rushing,\r\nspouting--a fountain of ablutions. Far towards the east, and beneath the\r\ntwo floating green banners of the Prophet, was the _mimber_ or pulpit of\r\nFriday prayer, and near it a platform for the choir, who face, not the\r\neast, but the Kibla, the holy house of Mecca. Under the shadowy arches\r\nare the cup and cradle of Jesus of Bethlehem, revered as a great\r\nteacher, the latter a hollowed block of red marble; the ‘sweating\r\ncolumn,’ the ‘shining stone,’ and the ‘cold window,’ fresh with the\r\nnorth wind, where the Sheik Shemseddin, the companion of Mahomet II.\r\n(the Conqueror), expounded the Koran. We may also see the pillar on\r\nwhich Mahomet the Conqueror left the mark of his bloody hand; for\r\nthrough the church itself, and the crowds of clergy and virgins who had\r\ntaken refuge there, he rode, exclaiming ‘There is no God but God, and\r\nMohammed is his Prophet,’ and ordaining the violation of sanctuary. Here\r\nand there, but lost in the extreme immensity, are chapels or refuges\r\nwhere groups of men, or of veiled women apart from them, seem to hold\r\nlittle services, with private litanies of their own. In some of these,\r\nsolitary individuals, wrapped in devotion or penance, were perpetually\r\nsmiting the earth with their foreheads: in one an old man was shouting,\r\nyelling, screaming portions of the Koran, flinging the words with\r\nsavagest ferocity amongst groups of squatters in fezes and turbans, who\r\nreceived them quite unconcerned.\r\n\r\n“The columns in the church make up the mystic number of forty, typical\r\nto the Eastern mind of all pomp and splendour. The cupola is inscribed\r\n‘God is the light of the heavens and the earth!’ On its Rhodian tiles\r\nare written ‘God hath founded it, and it will not be overthrown: God\r\nwill support it in the blush of the dawn.’ Nothing probably remains of\r\nthe fourth-century church of Constantine, but the present church is\r\nchiefly that of Justinian, who employed a hundred architects, each with\r\na hundred masons under him, of whom five thousand worked on the right,\r\nand five thousand on the left, according to the advice given to the\r\nemperor by an angel. The church itself is under the guardianship of an\r\nangel, who appeared to a boy watching the tools of lazy masons, and bade\r\nhim hurry them back to their work, saying he would guard his charge till\r\nhe came back. But the boy never came back, for the emperor intercepted\r\nhim, and sent him off, well provided for, to the Cyclades, that the\r\nangel might be obliged to watch for ever.\r\n\r\n“Our driver stuck his cigarette behind his ear and took us to the\r\nHippodrome, where we saw the great obelisk, raised by Theodosius on a\r\nbase with curious reliefs: and the brazen serpents supposed to have been\r\nbrought from Delphi, or the remains of them, for the Sultan Murad broke\r\noff one of their heads. Along the side of the square runs the screen of\r\nthe Mosque of Ahmed (the state church), enclosing its vast dusty court,\r\nold elm-trees, cloister, and a fountain, around which were groups of\r\npeople washing, dressing, and being shaved before entering the\r\nsanctuary.\r\n\r\n“We drove by the tomb of the Sultan Mahmoud the Reformer, where we\r\nstared through a metal screen at his sarcophagus, to the finest of the\r\ngreat mosques or _djami_, the glorious Suleimanyeh, which Solyman the\r\nMagnificent intended to surpass St. Sophia. On its giant dome is the\r\ntruly catholic inscription (Sura xxiv. 36), ‘God is the light of heaven\r\nand earth. His light is in the windows on the wall, in which a lamp\r\nburns covered with glass. The glass shines like a star, the lamp is lit\r\nwith the oil of a blessed tree. No Eastern, no Western oil; it shines\r\nfor whoever wills it.’ On the ever-clean matted floor of this mosque of\r\nglorious proportions numbers of barefooted children were sporting as in\r\na playground, and very pretty and graceful were the interlacing groups\r\nwhich they made. The ecclesiastical revenue of Suleimanyeh is 300,000\r\npiastres. Behind is a curious burial-ground, crowded with tombs, chiefly\r\nof women, marked by a sculptured rose, whilst the headstones of the men\r\nare crowned by a turban or fez. In two great sepulchral chapels or\r\n_turbé_ lie Solyman the Magnificent and his immediate family and\r\nsuccessors. The sarcophagi are covered with splendid embroideries and\r\ndelicate muslins, those of the sultans being often shrouded by their\r\nfavourite wives with their shawls--most precious of their possessions.\r\nAt their heads are their tall white turbans, with bunches of peacocks’\r\nfeathers on either side. The famous Roxolana lies amongst the group of\r\nladies.\r\n\r\n“But all through the streets of Stamboul the greatest feature is the\r\nlittle burial-grounds, with their closely packed tombs and their huge\r\ncypresses or tamarind trees, which always give them picturesqueness,\r\nbetween the houses, at the angles of the streets, everywhere--the dead\r\nforced, as it were, into the very life of the living, and never to be\r\nforgotten for a moment.\r\n\r\n“The next great feature--and an odious one--is the swarms of dogs, like\r\nlittle foxes, which lie about everywhere in the sun, encumbering the\r\nfootways, and refusing to move for any one. They are the friends of\r\ncats, but if a strange dog enters their quarter, they demolish him at\r\nonce. They never bite a human being, at least they have never been known\r\nto bite more than one, and that was--the Russian ambassador! Successive\r\ntravellers have given the idea that they are scavengers, but it is quite\r\nfalse: a man goes round at night with a cart and takes everything\r\nundesirable away. All night the air resounds with the yells of the dogs.\r\nThe English doctor is obliged to poison them by hundreds near the\r\nhospital, or all the patients would die of the noise.\r\n\r\n“We ended our first eventful drive at the Mosque of Bajazet, where the\r\ncourt was now turned into a bazaar, and round the central fountain\r\nglowed a moving mass of colour--white turbans, green turbans of Mecca,\r\npilgrims, negroes, Armenians, robed women in shot violet silk. Overhead\r\na perfect roar of wings indicated that the sacred pigeons of the mosque\r\nwere moving in vast battalions from one part to another. At the\r\nmany-coloured stalls, the beads--especially the green beads--were quite\r\nirresistible. In the _turbé_ of Bajazet, under the head of the Sultan,\r\nis a brick made of all the dust collected off his clothes and shoes\r\nduring his lifetime: his mother and his two daughters lie beside him.\r\n\r\n“It is a great pleasure having Gerard Lowther here; and the other\r\nattachés, Finlay and Tower, are charming.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 12._--As I have felt stronger, each day here has been more full of\r\ninterest. On alternate mornings I stay quietly in the Embassy garden or\r\nthe adjoining cemeteries and have luncheon with my kind hosts, with whom\r\nI have several times been out afterwards to the bazaars, steep, rugged,\r\nstony lanes, arched overhead, and a blaze of colour from their shops and\r\ncostumes. Here we have been served with cups of coffee in the inner den\r\nof Marchetto, the tradesman of ‘Paul Patoff,’[487] whilst going through\r\nthe wearisome routine of bargaining for old silver, weighing and\r\nreweighing, and only discovering one had concluded a purchase when one\r\nhad utterly despaired of it. How forcibly the truth of that verse of\r\nProverbs strikes one here--‘It is nought, it is nought, saith the buyer,\r\nbut when he goeth his way, he boasteth thereof.’ The whole bazaar seems\r\nlike an inextricable web to outsiders, yet any one or anything can be\r\nfound there in ten minutes by one who knows the place; and, amid all the\r\nbustle and confusion, one sees many a charming picture of an old Turk\r\nwith snowy beard and robes, sitting cross-legged at an angle of his\r\ncounter, poring over an ancient parchment Koran, and as utterly absorbed\r\nin it as if he were in the Great Desert. How the names Aladdin,\r\nMustapha, Scheherazade, Zobeide, recalled the large edition of the\r\n‘Arabian Nights’ which was at Hurstmonceaux Rectory in my childhood.\r\n\r\n“On other days I have gone off immediately after breakfast with a cavass\r\nfrom the Embassy--Dimitri--as my guard, making much use of the trams,\r\nfrom which one sees so much that is curious, and in which one has so\r\nmany experiences of Turkish life, from the ladies like bundles of green,\r\nbrown, or shot silk, who are huddled behind the curtain at the end of\r\nthe carriage, to the child-pasha well provided with copper coins to\r\nquiet the numerous clamourers for baksheesh. Thus I have twice reached\r\nYedi Kouli, the Seven Towers, where the triple walls of the town make\r\ntheir farthest angle close to the Sea of Marmora--bluest of blue waters\r\nmelting into chrysoprase-green near the shore. Here I was drawing an old\r\ngate in pencil in my little book, heedless of an old Turk who had been\r\ncursing the ‘christian dog’ as a breaker of the second commandment, when\r\nsuddenly, with a spring, he flew upon me, and in an instant his long\r\ntalons would have torn out my eyes, if Dimitri, throwing himself upon\r\nhim, had not hurled him on his back in the gutter, after which he got\r\nup, and went away quite quietly. Another day, after we had made the\r\ncircuit of the wonderful walls, I was sitting to draw in the middle of\r\nthe white dusty road near the Adrianople gate, and Dimitri had fallen\r\nasleep on a tombstone a few steps behind me, when suddenly he called out\r\nwith a rueful voice that he had been robbed, plundered of his watch and\r\nchain, whilst I, rather more in evidence in the sunshine, had escaped.\r\nIt is near this gate, the Polyandria of the Greeks, that we saw the\r\ncurious mosque, once a church covered with mosaics like St. Mark’s, and\r\nstill retaining many of them. One was shown as the Virgin waiting for\r\nher Teskerei, or passport, to go into Egypt!\r\n\r\n“All around the walls are tombs: the woods are filled, the hillsides are\r\npowdered, with them. The woods are all of cypress, which is supposed to\r\nneutralise effluvia. When a death occurs, a body is hurried to the grave\r\nas soon as possible, for the soul is always in torment, it is believed,\r\nbetween the death and burial. Little parcels of food are laid in holes\r\nby the side of the grave, and large headstones are always erected,\r\nstones on which the angels Nebir and Munkir sit to judge the souls of\r\nthe dead. We saw many touching little funerals--young girls being\r\ncarried to the grave without any coffin or shroud. The blocks of stone\r\non the road date from the time of Justinian. At an angle of the cemetery\r\nopposite the gate of Silivri a row of head-stones marks the graves of\r\nthe heads of Ali Pacha (de Tébelin) and his four sons, cut off in 1827.\r\nClose to this a lane turns off through the tombs and cypresses to the\r\nmonastery of Baloukli. Here, from a courtyard, filled, like everything\r\nelse, with tombs, we descended a staircase at the head of which an old\r\npriest was squatting as guardian of a number of huge brass alms-dishes.\r\nIn the subterranean chapel below are more alms-dishes, and a fountain\r\nwith the ‘miraculous fish,’ black on one side, red on the other. On the\r\n29th of May 1455, a monk was engaged in frying them, when a man rushed\r\nin and announced the capture of Constantinople by the Turks. ‘I shall\r\nbelieve it,’ said the monk, ‘when these fish leap out of the\r\nfrying-pan,’ and they leapt out immediately, and have remained\r\nhalf-cooked to this day! At the little restaurant close to the\r\nmonastery, shaded by pink Judas-trees and strewn with white sand, we had\r\nour luncheon, bread, pilaf, galetta, hard eggs, wine, and syrup of\r\nroses.\r\n\r\n“Beyond the Adrianople Gate the walls and cemetery descend together to\r\nEyoub, a hamlet at the head of the Golden Horn, with a very sacred\r\nmosque, which heretics are not allowed to enter, as it contains the\r\nsword of Mahomet, with which the Sultan girds himself on the day of his\r\ninstallation, and in its court, shaded by noble plane-trees, the tomb of\r\nEyoub, standard-bearer of the Prophet, near whose resting-place are\r\ngrouped a number of royal _turbé_, those of the Valide Sultana, mother\r\nof Selim III., and of Hussein Pacha being the most remarkable. We made a\r\nseparate excursion hither, finding the rugged streets round the mosque\r\noccupied by the gay booths of a fair shaded by banksia roses in full\r\nbloom, and the keeper of the sanctuary standing at the gate with a drawn\r\nsword to prevent the entrance of the giaours. But we wandered behind, by\r\nthe steep ascent between the eternal burial-grounds, where there was a\r\ngrand view down the Golden Horn between the old cypresses, all the\r\nmosques of Stamboul embossed upon an aërial sunset sky.\r\n\r\n“On May 3 we met a large party at Dolma Baghtché, one of the great\r\npalaces which are memorials of the extravagance of Abdul Medjid. The\r\nrooms are those in which his son, the savage Abdul Aziz, used to throw\r\neverything that came to hand at those who offended him. They are only\r\nused by the present Sultan for the great reception of Beiram, when all\r\nthe great dignitaries of the empire flock to kiss the hem of his\r\ngarment. The palace is vast, but decorated like a French café, with\r\nglass banisters to the staircase and numbers of fifth-rate pictures:\r\nnothing but the hall is worth seeing. Close by is the mosque of Abdul\r\nMedjid, with two slender minarets, and beyond it the palace of\r\nTeheragan-Sérai, where the ex-Sultan Murad is kept a prisoner, no one\r\nbeing allowed to linger either on the road or in a boat in front of the\r\nbuilding. The existing Sultan goes to see him sometimes, but asserts ‘My\r\nbrother and every one belonging to him are quite perfectly mad.’\r\n\r\n“We all went by carriage with an order to the Seraï or Seraglio near St.\r\nSophia, which occupies at least two-thirds of the ancient Byzantium,\r\nselected by Constantine for his capital. By an unkempt ascent we reach\r\nthe Bab-el-Sélam, or Gate of Safety, which had doors on either side, and\r\nin the intermediate space of which high officials condemned by the Divan\r\nwere executed. Passing an avenue of cypresses, we reached a second gate,\r\nthe Bab Seadet, or Gate of Happiness, guarded by white eunuchs. It was\r\nhere that the sultans used to give up their unpopular ministers to the\r\npopular fury; that Murad III. gave up his favourite falconer, Mehemet,\r\nto be cut to pieces before his eyes; that Mahomet III. gave up his three\r\nchief eunuchs, and Murad IV. his grand-vizier Hafiz, who was killed by\r\nseventeen wounds. Many old aunts and cousins of sultans still reside in\r\nthe inner apartments, guarded by numbers of eunuchs, the historic\r\ncriminal figures of Turkish history, whose existence is expressly\r\ncondemned by the Koran, and who are generally bought or stolen as\r\nchildren from Syria or Abyssinia. Without name, family, or sex, they\r\noften marry, and even have harems for the sake of feminine friendship.\r\n\r\n“The treasury is full of boundless barbaric treasures, uncut emeralds,\r\n&c., and much fine armour and china. The finest single object is the\r\nthrone of Selim I., taken from the Shah of Persia, of green enamel\r\nstudded with pearls and rubies. In the Salle du Divan is the curious bed\r\nwhere the sultans received ambassadors, though they only saw him through\r\nthe window. We also saw the glorious Bagdad mosque lined with blue\r\nPersian tiles, built by the Sultan Amurath in remembrance of one he had\r\nknown at Bagdad. In the garden is the famous cage where, from the time\r\nof Mahomet IV., sultans shut up princes who rebelled against them: Abdul\r\nAziz was confined there from his deposition to his death. Afterwards, I\r\nsat with Sir George Bowen on the terrace, which has an exquisite view up\r\nthe Bosphorus, while immediately below us ran the railway line, which\r\nsuggests the fall of Turkey. We were served with sweetmeats of\r\nrose-leaves, and coffee in golden cups studded with diamonds, by an\r\nattendant who bore an embroidered cloth upon his shoulder to conceal the\r\nempty cups which had been used by Christians, and were therefore\r\nunclean. This would sound hospitable on the part of the Sultan if one\r\nforgot to mention that we had each had to pay about fifteen francs to\r\nenter the palace, and that there were about thirty of us.\r\n\r\n“Another day we went to the mosque of Selimyeh, beautifully situated,\r\nand afterwards I sat to draw under a bower of banksia roses, surrounded\r\nby a marvellous group of Turkish figures, in the Saddlers’ Bazaar\r\n(_serra-jobane-jamissi_). Here the people were good to us, as there are\r\nso many Christians in that quarter of the town, but generally the\r\nnatives never cease cursing those who are breaking the second\r\ncommandment by making a likeness of something in heaven or earth. In the\r\ncourtyard of Suleimanyeh I was less fortunate: a number of soldiers\r\ncrowded in front, wholly obstructing all view, and on Dimitri\r\nremonstrating, their officer came up quite furious, with ‘My men shall\r\nstand where they like, and if they wish to hide the man’s view they\r\nshall certainly do so.’ Twice I have toiled to the distant mosque of\r\nMehmedyé, for Mahomet the Conqueror built it on the site of the famous\r\nchurch of the Holy Apostles, founded by Constantine the Great, and where\r\nhe was buried with eleven other emperors. A dial over a gate near this\r\nis inscribed (from the Koran), ‘Didst thou not see thy Lord, how He\r\nextended thy shadow?’ On some of these excursions it has been most\r\ndifficult to procure anything whatever for luncheon, for it is the fast\r\nof Ramazan, when no good Turk allows any food whatever to pass his lips\r\nbetween sunrise and sunset, on the approach of which he will begin to\r\nhold in his hands the viands which he will devour the very instant the\r\ngun fires. Wine at all times is described as ‘the father of all\r\nabominations,’ yet Solyman the Great, who burnt all the vessels laden\r\nwith wine in the port, himself died drunk: Murad IV., who cut off the\r\nhead of any one who smelt of wine, was a regular drunkard: Bajazet I.\r\nand II. both drank, and to Selim II. was given the surname of\r\n‘mesth’--the drunkard: so much for the far-famed Turkish consistency.\r\n\r\n“We went to the evening service at St. Sophia, three white-turbaned\r\nfigures receiving us in the dark at a postern door, and--after exacting\r\nten francs apiece--conducting us by a winding stair to the broad\r\ngallery, far beneath which the great chandeliers gleamed like\r\nflower-beds over the immense grey space, intersected by long lines of\r\nblack figures--all males, for women are soulless--bending, curvetting,\r\nprostrating symmetrically like corn in a wind, and with the same kind of\r\nrush and rustle. It is a curious but monotonous sight, a repetition of\r\nthe same movement over and over again, and the shrill harsh cry of the\r\nswaying and falling lines, even more discordant in its echo by the\r\nchoir, soon grates upon one: especially as the priests never cease\r\nwhispering and worrying for extra baksheesh.\r\n\r\n“After waiting one morning for a weary time with an order at the\r\n‘Selamlik,’ we saw the Sultan go to the Yildis mosque. The coachman was\r\ngorgeous in his golden livery, but the ‘Sultan of Sultans, the King of\r\nKings,’ was a piteous sight, a mixture of boredom and terror. Cringing\r\ncowardice prevents his going to Stamboul more than one day in the year,\r\nand this occurred lately. It is a great day for the court ladies, who\r\nare all allowed to accompany him in three hundred carriages, and avenge\r\nthemselves for veiled faces by exhibiting their bare arms covered with\r\nbracelets and as much else as they dare. Mahomet says, ‘He who espouses\r\nonly one wife is praiseworthy,’ and now it is considered indiscreet to\r\nhave more than four legitimate wives, who are all equal, and who have\r\neach their own dowry and servants. Women are generally well treated\r\nhere now, a divorce is easy, and each wife has a right to a separate\r\nroom, and may even exact a separate house, if she cannot get on with the\r\nother wives.\r\n\r\n“Almost every night through the streets there is a rush of the\r\nTalumbodgi or firemen--half-naked savages with primitive engines, who\r\nscurry to save the valuables of burning houses, not for the owners, but\r\nfor themselves, so that they are far more dreaded than the flames. In\r\nrecent conflagrations in Galata and Pera it is certain that the fire\r\nbegan in three or four places at the same moment; for when a street in\r\nConstantinople is wholly bad or unsafe, the authorities do not scruple\r\nto set fire to it, regardless of the consequences, though the people are\r\nsuch fatalists that they will not leave their dwellings till the last\r\nmoment, and then fly, leaving everything behind them.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 22._--I write during a quiet day with George at the Embassy, after\r\nmy return from Broussa, where I have been spending a week.... It was a\r\nvoyage of five hours in a steamer crowded with Turks on their carpets,\r\nsleeping, praying, or reciting the Koran, and at the ends of the vessel\r\nknots, lumps, and clusters of women. Outside Seraglio Point the view of\r\nStamboul is very fine, St. Sophia and the Achmet mosque rising above the\r\nold sea-walls, and the gardens lovely with rich green and pink Judas\r\nbloom. We passed the islands--Antigone, where Sir H. Bulwer lived with\r\nthe Greek princess, and Prinkapo, to which the Empress Irene was\r\nbanished, and where she is buried. After two hours it became very\r\nrough, and all were sick, especially a number of Turkish officers, who\r\nup to that time had been eating voraciously. So it was indeed a relief\r\nwhen we entered the comparatively calm bay of Mudania, with its glorious\r\nleaping ‘multitudinous seas’ of sapphire and chrysoprase waves, amid\r\nwhich endless dolphins--true clowns of the sea--were tumbling and\r\nsporting.\r\n\r\n“At Mudania a horde of half-naked savages leaped on board to seize our\r\nluggage, and a hand-to-hand fight ensued, during which we had to scale\r\nthe bulwarks of the vessel to reach the pier. Then came a scramble and a\r\nbargaining for carriages, but at last we were off and up the hills,\r\nwhere boys were selling piles of cherries for half a piastre (1¼ d.)\r\non the ascent. In the valley beyond, we came up with a knot of carriages\r\nin a desolate place, the inmates standing in the road round one whose\r\nwheel was coming off. It had contained two ladies, and I took up one of\r\nthem, who turned out to be Miss Holmes, sister of the librarian at\r\nWindsor. Very lovely was the ascent to Broussa, through the rich green\r\nwalnut-woods and by rushing streams, to the exquisite chain of mosques\r\nand minarets under the lower slopes of Olympus. At the table-d’hôte we\r\nhad the British Consul, who stated that he ‘was not at all gone on\r\nmosques;’ he had been seventeen years in Constantinople and had seen\r\nnothing but St. Sophia--‘what on earth was the good?’ The hotel was\r\ndelightful, and nothing could be more exquisite than the view from my\r\nwindow, whence I watched the long lines of camels following the\r\ninevitable donkey, and the handsome population, arrayed in every colour\r\nof the rainbow as to male turbans and girdles and the loose robes women\r\nare arrayed in. Thence also, I constantly heard, from the mosque of\r\nMurad, the shrill voice ‘La Ilah il Allah vè Mohammed resoul Allah,’\r\ncalling the people to prayer.\r\n\r\n“On the first day I joined Miss Holmes and her friend Miss Bacon on a\r\nlong excursion through the town, going first to the famous Green Mosque\r\n(Yéchil-Djami), which stands on a platform with old trees and a glorious\r\nview over the plain. We were not allowed to enter at once; it was the\r\nservice for women, who are permitted this mosque only. ‘Priest very old\r\nand well covered up: it must be so,’ said the dragoman; ‘it is necessary\r\nto guard their moralities: just let them a little loose, and it is a\r\nvery bad job.’\r\n\r\n“Close by is a beautiful _turbé_ with an entrance worthy of the\r\nAlhambra, and lovely tiles and jewelled glass within. Beneath the dome\r\nlies the sarcophagus of Mahomet I., with those of his son, his six\r\ndaughters, and their nurse--the last very plain, but close to the royal\r\ncoffins. In the centre of the mosque itself is a beautiful fountain,\r\nwhich freshens the air with a rush of falling waters: around are\r\ninscriptions--‘God is love,’ ‘Mahomet is the prophet of God,’ and the\r\nnames of the six caliphs who were the companions of Mahomet. The\r\n_mimber_ here is only ascended by the Sheik el Islam himself, when he\r\ngives the blessing with the Koran. As an interior, Oulou-Djami, the\r\ngreat mosque in the centre of the town, has even more perfect\r\nproportions--a perfection of interlacing architecture inclining to\r\ngothic, forming twenty-four cupolas, and centering in the great dome\r\nabove a splashing fountain. Outside this mosque, facing the street, a\r\nbay-tree overshadows the tomb of a sainted dervish: sick people hang\r\nbits of their clothes around it, and think that, with them, they leave\r\ntheir ailments there. Oulou-Djami stands on the edge of the vast bazaar,\r\nwhere splendid Eastern dresses are seen in perfection: the perfectly\r\nfitting jackets and breeches of the men, of richest embroidered stuff,\r\nnever costing less than from £3 to £10, so that one wondered at their\r\nnot minding the frequent torrents of rain; but it is all ‘kismet.’ When\r\nat home these glorious-looking Turks do nothing, for there is nothing to\r\ndo: if a house takes fire, they do not care--there is nothing to burn\r\nbut a few divans: perhaps the owner takes his clothes with him when he\r\nescapes--there is nothing else to take. They rise early and have a cup\r\nof coffee, at ten they breakfast, at six is dinner, at eight they go to\r\nbed: a few possible visits are the only variety of the day.\r\n\r\n“It was a delightful drive to the Citadel, where all the space not\r\noccupied by wonderful old buildings is shaded by the most magnificent\r\nplanes and cypresses, watered by crystal streams, which have their\r\nsource here. The tombs of the first Osmanli princes, Osman and Orchan,\r\nare here, restored after an earthquake. On the tomb of Osman lies the\r\norder of the Osmanlieh: two of his sons and fourteen of his daughters\r\nsurround him. A more curious family burial-place is that of Mouradié, a\r\ngreen enclosure, bright with fountains and roses, and containing a whole\r\nsuccession of venerable _turbé_ of the family of Murad I. and Mehemet\r\nII., chiefly murdered victims. Amongst the latter, the tomb of the\r\nhero-prince Djem is especially rich and striking. The grave of Murad, by\r\nhis own desire, is left open to the rain of heaven, and is covered with\r\nsickly grass. Of the early Broussa Sultans, several--being sons of\r\nfathers of eighteen and mothers of sixteen--were generals of armies and\r\ngovernors of provinces at fourteen, and their enormous families were due\r\nto the fact that they continued to have children from sixteen to\r\nseventy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BATHS, BROUSSA.]\r\n\r\n“We drove on to another noble mosque at Tchékirgué, about two miles from\r\nBroussa, with more tombs and relics. Amongst the latter is shown a\r\nprayer, inscribed on wood and enclosed in a bottle. ‘When the bottle\r\nbreaks, Broussa will become christian,’ is the tradition--suggesting an\r\neasy and cheap enterprise for missionaries. In front of this mosque\r\n(Ghazy-Hounkiar) is a fountain surrounded by cold and hot springs\r\nalternately, and a little below the village, on the edge of the valley,\r\nare the picturesque old domed baths, the strong sulphuric springs of\r\nwhich are famous throughout Turkey. All around Broussa is rich soil and\r\nvegetation; hollyhocks grow wild along the hedges: it is a glorious\r\nclimate: only justice and government are needed.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to go away without seeing more of the Bosphorus, but I have\r\njust been to Therapia, where the _villeggiatura_ life in summer must be\r\ndelightful.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_May 23._--My last hours at Constantinople were spent in an expedition\r\nwith the Whites in their picturesque state barge to the Sweet Waters of\r\nEurope. I believe I have said nothing of Sir William White, though he is\r\nthe ambassador in whose house I have been living so long. His simple\r\nmanners are full of bluff humour. He is said to understand the Turk\r\nperfectly, and rose entirely by his own merits, with the help of a lucky\r\nappointment to the Conference of 1876-77.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ LOUISA, MARCHIONESS OF WATERFORD.\r\n\r\n“_Ober-Ammergau, June 2._--We have seen the Passion-Play. It is a day to\r\nhave lived for: nothing can be more sublimely devotional, more\r\nindescribably pathetic.\r\n\r\n“Our journey from Constantinople was accomplished very easily. We stayed\r\nto see Buda-Pesth, a very handsome modern city, and then had two days\r\nof perfect enjoyment at Halstadt and the exquisite Gosau Lake. On Friday\r\nnight we slept at Oberau, and drove here early on Saturday morning,\r\nfinding the Lowthers at once in the village street, and spending most of\r\nthat day in drawing with them. We went at once to the house of the\r\nBurgomaster to inquire where we were billeted. All the material part of\r\nlife is most comfortably and economically arranged for visitors. I am\r\nquartered with St. Thomas, and all through the day one meets peasants\r\nwith long hair, recalling Biblical figures. The Burgomaster’s beautiful\r\ndaughter is the Virgin Mary. In a gracious and touching spirit of\r\nunselfish love all these villagers live together for mutual help and\r\ncomfort. They have been trained under their late pastor, Aloys\r\nDaisemberger, to regard the Passions-Spiel, which is the great event of\r\ntheir quiet lives, not only as a religious service of thanksgiving to\r\nwhich every talent and energy must be contributed for the glory of God,\r\nand a manifestation of gratitude for His preservation of them, but they\r\nare also taught to look upon it as an instrument which God’s grace has\r\nplaced in their hands for the calling back of Europe to Christianity,\r\nthrough the dark mists of infidelity which have been creeping over it in\r\nthe nineteenth century. And truly in this the actual visit to\r\nOber-Ammergau may be as full of teaching as the great representation\r\nitself--the simple contact with such men as ‘Christus Maier,’[488] as he\r\nis called, whose life’s work is ‘to endeavour to do God’s will _aufs\r\ninnersten_, and to be helpful to those around him.’ Here, in\r\nOber-Ammergau--perhaps here alone--religion takes no heed of Roman\r\nCatholic or Protestant vagaries; the will of God, the example of Christ,\r\nthose are the only guidance of life. In the five sermons of Daisemberger\r\npreparatory to the Passion-Play of 1871,[489] there is not a single word\r\nwhich indicates Romanism. ‘Look, O disciples of Christ,’ says\r\nDaisemberger to his people; ‘see your Master, how gentle, how kind He\r\nis, how mild in His intercourse with those around Him, how full of\r\nheartiest sympathy for their joys and sorrows. Then can you, in your\r\nintercourse with those around you, be grumbling, rough, discourteous,\r\nself-asserting, repellent, and wanting in sympathy? Oh no! you could\r\nnever endure to be so unlike your Master.’\r\n\r\n“It is a beautiful place, a high upland mountain valley, covered with\r\nrich pastures and enamelled with flowers. A long street, or rather road,\r\nlined by comfortable detached timber houses, leads to the handsome\r\nchurch, around which the older part of the village groups itself above\r\nthe clear rushing Ammer, and is highly picturesque. Beyond the village,\r\nin the meadows overlooked by the peak of the Kofel, is the theatre where\r\nthe great drama of the Passion is enacted, which, ever since 1634, has\r\ncommemorated every tenth year the then deliverance of Ammergau from the\r\nplague which was devastating the neighbouring villages.\r\n\r\n“All through Friday it was curious to meet a succession of London\r\nacquaintances, and most unexpected ones, but from all being here with\r\none object, no one was uncongenial. And all is so perfectly managed,\r\nthere is no fuss or hurry; comfortable accommodation, good seats,\r\nexcellent food are provided for all who are permitted to come, for the\r\nvisitors for every performance are limited to the 2000 for whom there is\r\nroom; no unexpected persons, no excursionists are ever admitted. No\r\nthought of gain has ever the slightest influence upon the villagers, and\r\nthe prices are only such as pay what is absolutely due.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday morning, I imagine, no visitor could sleep after four, when\r\ntheir peasant hosts began to tramp overhead and clatter down their\r\nnarrow oak staircases. Then, after an excellent breakfast of hot coffee,\r\ncream, eggs, and toast, many visitors and all the people of\r\nOber-Ammergau hurried to the six-o’clock service in the church, where\r\nall the five hundred actors knelt with their pastor in silent prayer,\r\nand many of them received the Sacrament. At eight all were comfortably\r\nplaced in their seats in the open-air theatre, and the soft wild music\r\nof Schutzgeister, which seems to come from behind the hills, preluded\r\nthe performance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OBER-AMMERGAU.]\r\n\r\n“One might be seated in the Piazza del Popolo at Rome with one’s back to\r\nthe gate. There is the same vast intervening space, and the same three\r\nbranching streets (the central closed by an inner theatre for tableaux),\r\nwith marked buildings at the entrance. Only here those buildings are the\r\nhouses of Annas, Caiaphas, and Pilate, and the streets are those of\r\nJerusalem, lined with Eastern houses, domes, and here and there a\r\npalm-tree, and they melt far away into lovely ethereal mountain\r\ndistances, the real mountains of the Bavarian Alps. The performance\r\nbegins when the spirit-chorus of eighteen persons, male and female, in\r\nmany-coloured tunics and mantles, advance in stately lines from either\r\nside of the stage, and in a chaunt, weird but most distinctly audible,\r\nexplain what is coming, and urge those present to receive it in a humble\r\nspirit of reverence and adoration of God. Then, on the central stage,\r\nbegin the strange series of types and antitypes, and, as the veil falls\r\nthe second time, the vast Hosanna-procession of five hundred men, women,\r\nand children, singing, shouting, and strewing palm-branches, appears\r\ndown the distant streets, and, as it draws nearer, and the mountains\r\nresound with jubilant shouts and the whole air is ablaze with life and\r\ncolour, the serene, rapt, stately figure of the Christus, riding upon\r\nthe ass, but even then spiritualised into absolute sublimity by the\r\nsense of his divine mission, comes for the first time before us.\r\nAfterwards, through the long eight hours of thrilling tension which\r\nfollow, overshadowing the endless, almost wearisome, series of Old\r\nTestament scenes, drawing every heart and eye nearer to himself through\r\nthe agony of the trial, the cross-bearing, the crucifixion, does that\r\nsublime figure become more familiar; never again can the thought of the\r\nGod-man be severed from it. And in the great drama itself one sees all\r\nthe rest, but one feels with, one lives for, the Christ alone; and the\r\ndignity of his lofty patience, unmoved from the holy calm which pervades\r\nhis whole being even when four hundred savage Jews are shouting and\r\njibing round in clamorous eagerness for his death, must be present with\r\none through life.\r\n\r\n“I cannot tell it all. Words fail and emotions are too much. Through\r\nthat long day--oh! is it that day alone?--one knows how to live with, to\r\nsuffer with Christ: one is raised above earth and its surroundings: one\r\ndies with Him to sin and suffering: one is raised with Him into heavenly\r\nplaces. After some hours, England is forgotten, Germany is forgotten.\r\nYou are a Jew. Jerusalem is your home: all, _all_ your interests are\r\ncentred there: nothing earthly is of the very least importance to you\r\nexcept the great tragedy that is being enacted before your eyes. It is\r\nperhaps the humanity of Christ which is brought most forcibly before\r\nyou; but oh! how divinely human, how humanly divine!\r\n\r\n“Could one wonder that Mr. Vanderbilt, the American millionaire, said\r\nthat he owed everything--everything for this world and the next--to\r\nOber-Ammergau? it had unveiled and explained religion for him: it had\r\nmade the Bible a living reality.\r\n\r\n“I think of the Old Testament scenes, the Fall of the Manna is the most\r\nbeautiful. More than four hundred Israelites, including a hundred and\r\nfifty children, are seen--groups of the most exquisite and harmonious\r\ncolour--with Moses and Aaron in the desert; and between you and them,\r\nand amongst and around them, falls mysteriously the soft vaporous manna;\r\nwhilst the chorus in sweet, wild, lingering monotone chaunt the\r\nbeautiful hymn beginning--\r\n\r\n    ‘Gut ist der Herr, gut ist der Herr.’\r\n\r\n“Of the New Testament scenes, the leave-taking with the family of\r\nBethany is perhaps the most pathetic. It is an exquisite sunset scene.\r\nHuge olive-trees stretch their gnarled boughs overhead and are embossed\r\nagainst the amber sky, in the distance the village of Bethany stands out\r\nin the soft blue mists of evening. Through the sunset comes the Christ\r\nin lingering last words with the sisters and Lazarus, and there, under\r\nthe old trees, is their last farewell, touching indescribably, after\r\nwhich the weeping family return to Bethany, and he goes away, a solitary\r\nfigure upon the burnt hills in the twilight, to his death at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n“At Ober-Ammergau one for the first time realises the many phases of\r\nthe trial--in the house of Caiaphas, of Annas, of Pilate, of Caiaphas\r\nagain, of Pilate again; and all is terribly real--the three crosses, for\r\ninstance, so really heavy, that none but a very strong man can support\r\nthem. One thinks better of Pilate after the performance, through which\r\none has watched his struggles--his weary, hopeless struggles to save the\r\nlife of Christ. Almost every act, nearly every word, is directly taken\r\nfrom the Gospel history. Amongst the few touches added is that of Mary\r\nthe mother, accidentally arriving at Jerusalem, meeting the other Marys\r\nin one of the side streets and talking of the condemnation of a Galilean\r\nwhich has just taken place. Then, as the street opens, suddenly seeing\r\nthe cross-bearing in the distance, and thrilling the whole audience with\r\nanguish in her cry of ‘It is my son: it is Jesus!’ The Last Supper is an\r\nexact reproduction of Leonardo’s fresco, and many of the other scenes\r\nfollow the great masters.\r\n\r\n“How thrilling were the words, how almost more thrilling were the\r\n_silences_, of Christ.[490]\r\n\r\n“The evening shadows are beginning to fall as we see Christ raised on\r\nthe cross. He hangs there for twenty minutes, and most indescribably\r\nsublime are the words given from thence. When all is over, it is so\r\nreal, you think that _this time_ death must really have taken place. The\r\nthree crosses, the bound thieves, the fainting women, the mounted\r\ncenturion, the soldiers drawing lots, all seem to belong to real events,\r\nenacted, not acted. The deposition of the dead Christ on the white\r\nsheet is a vast Rubens picture.[491]\r\n\r\n“The resurrection is more theatrical, but in the final scene, where the\r\nperfect figure of the spiritual Christ is seen for the last time, he\r\ngoes far away with his disciples and the Marys, and then, upon Olivet,\r\nin the midst of the group relieved against the golden sunset, he\r\nsolemnly blesses his beloved ones, and whilst you gaze rapt, seems to be\r\nraised a little, and then you look for him and he is not.\r\n\r\n“Each one of the four thousand spectators then sits in a vast sense of\r\nloneliness amid the silent Bavarian hills. The long tension is over. The\r\nday is lived out. The Master we have followed we can follow no longer\r\nwith material sight. He has suffered, died, and risen from the grave,\r\nand is no longer with us: in the heavens alone can we hope to behold Him\r\nas He is.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Ober-Ammergau, Hugh Bryans and I went with the Lowthers\r\nand Mrs. Ridley to Rothenburg, still an unaltered diminutive mediaeval\r\ncity, and the most interesting place in Germany. Then I paid a\r\ndelightful visit to my dear Bunsen friends at Carlsruhe and Herrenalb,\r\nand on our way back to England we saw the marvellous Schloss Eltz,\r\ngoing thither in a bullock-cart up the bed of the river from the\r\nattractive little inn at Moselkern, kept by a very old man and woman,\r\nsitting upon the very border-land of heaven.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the varied occupations of this summer of 1890 I was asked to\r\nwrite biographies of several members of my family for the “Dictionary of\r\nNational Biography,” and did so. My articles appeared, but greatly\r\naltered. The editor had a perfect right to condense them at his\r\npleasure, but I was astonished to find _additions_. Bishop Hare was\r\nsaddled with a third son, Richard Hare, “an apothecary of Winchester,”\r\nwho was the father of James Hare, afterwards called the “Hare with many\r\nfriends.” This son of my great-great-grandfather is entirely imaginary;\r\nour family was never in the remotest degree related to Richard or James\r\nHare. It gave one a terrible impression of how the veracity and\r\nusefulness of a work of really national importance might be spoilt by\r\nthe conceited ignorance of an editor; and to add such trash to an\r\narticle published with the signature of another was as unjustifiable as\r\nit was abominable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Woodbastwick Hall, August 6, 1890._--I have enjoyed a visit at Cobham\r\nvery much. We had only the usual circle of guests, but summer days in\r\nthat beautiful place are a delicious halt in life. Thence I went to\r\nOsterley, which looked bewitching, with its swans floating in sunshine\r\nbeyond the shade of the old cedars. Those radiant gardens will now bloom\r\nthrough five years unseen, for Lord Jersey has accepted the Governorship\r\nof New South Wales, which can only be from a sense of duty, as it is an\r\nimmense self-sacrifice, though he and Lady Jersey can never fail\r\nanywhere to be a centre of all that is most interesting and useful. To\r\nEnglish society her absence will be a terrible loss, as, with the utmost\r\nsimplicity of high breeding, she is the one person left in England who\r\nis capable of holding a _salon_ and keeping it filled, to the\r\nadvantage--in every best sense--of all who enter it. Nothing can be more\r\ncharming than the relation of Lord and Lady Jersey to their children,\r\nand the fact that the latter were always of the party, yet never in its\r\nway, was the greatest testimony to their up-bringing. The weather was\r\nreally hot enough for the luxury of open windows everywhere and for\r\nsitting out all day. The party was a most pleasant one--M. de Staël, the\r\nRussian Ambassador; Lady Crawford, still lovely as daylight, and her\r\nnice daughter Lady Evelyn; Lady Galloway, brimming with cleverness; M.\r\nde Montholon, French Minister at Athens; Mr. and Mrs. Frank Parker, most\r\namusing and cheery; Sir Philip Currie, General Fielding, &c. Everything\r\nwas most unostentatiously sumptuous and most enjoyable. On Monday we\r\nwere sent in three carriages to Richmond, where we saw Sir Francis\r\nCooke’s collections, very curious and worth seeing as it is, but which,\r\nif his pictures deserved the names they bear, would be one of the finest\r\ngalleries in the world. Then, after a luxurious luncheon at the ‘Star\r\nand Garter,’ we went on to Ham House, where Lady Huntingtower showed the\r\ncuriosities, including all the old dresses kept in a chest in the long\r\ngallery. Finally, I told the Jersey children--splendid audience--a long\r\nstory in a glade of the Osterley garden, where the scene might have\r\nrecalled the ‘Decameron.’ I was very sorry to leave these kind friends,\r\nand to know it would be so long before I saw them again.\r\n\r\n“I came here with the Lowthers, finding kind Mrs. Cator surrounded by\r\nthree sons and eight daughters. This is a luxurious modern house,\r\nreplacing one which was burnt. Only a lawn and trees separate it from\r\nthe Norfolk Broads, and we have floated down the Bere in a delightful\r\nsailing-boat, through the huge thirsty water-plants, to the weird\r\nremains of St. Benet in the Holme, of which the Bishops of Norwich are\r\nstill titular Abbots.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Sept. 6._--I have enjoyed a visit to Holmbury (Mr. Leveson Gower’s),\r\nnow let to Mr. Knowles of the _Nineteenth Century_--a lovely place with\r\na delightful view over Surrey plains. I like its homelike character\r\nbetter than the larger place of Mr. Ralli, whither we went yesterday to\r\na garden-party. Mr. Knowles is most delightful company, full of\r\npertinent and never _im_pertinent questions. He has talked much of\r\nTennyson, with whom his family are very intimate, and who used often to\r\nstay with him when he first married and lived on Clapham Common.\r\nTennyson speaks every thought without respect of persons. ‘What fish is\r\nthis?’ (at dinner).--‘Whiting.’--‘Yes, the meanest fish there is.’ Yet\r\nhis kindness of heart is such, that when his partridge was afterwards\r\ngiven him almost raw, he ate steadily through it, for fear his hostess\r\nmight be vexed.\r\n\r\n“After dinner Tennyson will sit smoking his pipe by the chimney-corner.\r\nThat is his great time for inspiration, but he will seldom write\r\nanything down. ‘Thousands of lines just float up this chimney,’ he said\r\none day. Sometimes he will go into the drawing-room and recite something\r\nhe has just composed. Some of these poems Mr. Knowles has written down.\r\nIf asked to repeat them again, Tennyson can never do it in the same way,\r\nsomething is always altered or forgotten: so hundreds of his poems are\r\nlost. One day lately, when he was unusually melancholy, his nurse, whom\r\nhe greatly likes (he always has a nurse now), took him to task. ‘Mr.\r\nTennyson, you ought to be ashamed of yourself for grumbling in this way:\r\nyou ought to be expressing your gratitude for your recovery from your\r\nbad illness by giving us something--by giving it to the world.’ And he\r\ntook her reproof very well, and went away to his own room, and in\r\nhalf-an-hour had written his lines ‘Crossing the Bar,’ which he gave to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“Tennyson was very rude to Mrs. Brotherton, a neighbour at Freshwater.\r\nThe next day he came to her house with a great cabbage under each arm.\r\n‘I heard you liked these, so I brought them.’ It was his idea of a\r\npeace-offering.\r\n\r\n“My ‘France’ is just appearing, under the guardianship of Ruskin’s\r\nfriend Allen. I think it is good. I have certainly worked hard at it.\r\nThe woodcuts are beautifully engraved, and with the letterpress I have\r\neven more than usual followed Arthur Young’s advice to authors--‘To\r\nexpunge as readily as to compose.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 14, 1890._--I went on the 27th to Worth, the ultra-luxurious\r\nhouse of the Montefiores, where the servants have their own\r\nbilliard-tables, ballroom, theatre, and pianofortes, and are arrogant\r\nand presumptuous in proportion. It was a pleasure to drive over to the\r\npicturesque old manor-house of Gravetye, which belongs to Mr. W.\r\nRobinson, who wrote ‘The English Flower-Garden;’ but except the thickets\r\nof Michaelmas daisies, I was disappointed in his flowers, for he only\r\nattempts those which belong to the naturally existing soil. A far more\r\nbeautiful garden is that of Mrs. Rate at Milton Court, near Dorking,\r\nwhither I went afterwards. John Evelyn’s own house of Wotton is much\r\naltered, but this, which was the dower-house of the Evelyns, remains as\r\nit was in his time, and most lovely are the ranges of brilliant\r\nold-fashioned flowers relieved against the yew-hedges. Mrs. Rate took me\r\na long drive over the back of Leith Hill, with views of unspeakable\r\nbeauty: abroad, there is nothing like such radiance and wealth of\r\nwoodland, such exquisite delicacy of misty distance. I was put down at\r\nthe station on my way to Highcliffe, to which I hastened in answer to an\r\nunusually urgent and affectionate invitation from its dear lady, bidding\r\nme on no account to miss coming at that time; at another time it might\r\nnot be possible. I found the dear Lady Waterford sadly ailing, but I\r\nhope I was able to be useful to her during some days of extreme quietude\r\nand much reading aloud. She had lately been to the Queen at Osborne,\r\ncrossing the Solent in the _Elfin_, seated between the two great\r\nbags--‘as big as large arm-chairs’--containing the Queen’s letters for\r\nthe day. ‘The Queen would have my drawings in. It was dreadful! for you\r\nknow how a big portfolio slides off the table, and the Queen looked at\r\nthem all so closely, and I was afraid the portfolio would slip and catch\r\nhold of her nose, and then I should have been sent to the Tower or\r\nsomething. There was one of the drawings she liked so much that I gave\r\nit to her. It was of Time with his scythe over his shoulder. A quantity\r\nof little children were gambolling and sporting in front and beckoning\r\nhim onwards, but behind were a number of old people trying to hold him\r\nback; for one wanted to go on with his book, another to finish a\r\ndrawing, and so on, and so they were clinging to his skirts as he was\r\nstriding away.’\r\n\r\n“Lady Waterford cannot understand the physical signs of age which seem\r\nto be suddenly attacking her: yet spiritually she is more than ever\r\nliving in Eternity’s sunrise. Truly those who have lived much at\r\nHighcliffe or Ford can never ‘think this life a low and poor place in\r\nwhich to seek the Divine Master walking to and fro.’[492]\r\n\r\n“I felt sadder than usual in leaving Highcliffe this time, as if it\r\nmight be a last visit, yet it is difficult to imagine life without what\r\nhas given its greatest interest and charm. The dear lady was down before\r\nI came away, though it was very early, and I retain a beautiful picture\r\nof her standing in the conservatory under the great brugmantia laden\r\nwith its orange flowers. She came with me through the rooms, and I\r\nlooked back at her, and found her still looking after me, and so,\r\nsomehow walked away sadly down the dewy lanes to the station, with a\r\ndesolate feeling that I might see her no more.\r\n\r\n“I went on to Babraham (the Adeanes’), whence I drove with Charlie to\r\nspend the afternoon at Audley End--what a magnificent place! Afterwards\r\nI had two days at pleasant, merry Hardwick.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ LOUISA, MARCHIONESS OF WATERFORD.\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 10, 1890._--On October 20 I went to Tatton, meeting a large and\r\npleasant party for the week, and one sees every one there to perfection,\r\nLady Egerton knowing so well how to unlock a portal of\r\ncommunication--often of friendship--with just the right key. Truly,\r\nindeed, might Lady Egerton say--\r\n\r\n    ‘Je suis né pour plaire aux nobles âmes,\r\n     Pour les consoler un peu d’un monde impur.’[493]\r\n\r\nThe country is black but always interesting. Little Knutsford was sanded\r\nall over in patterns (as in India) for a wedding: it is a custom which\r\ndates from King Alfred, who met a wedding-party as he was passing\r\nthrough the town and threw down some sand, saying that he hoped the\r\ndescendants of the marriage might be as numerous as its grains. The\r\npatterns of sand--flowers, love-knots, &c.--are made through the spout\r\nof a teapot. One day the conversation fell upon the little hamlet of\r\nFlash in the Cheshire hills. Pedlars from Manchester used to waste their\r\ntime there in drinking on their way to London, whence the term\r\n‘flash-goods!’ We drove to Holford Hall, passing on the outskirts of\r\nTabley many of the brown many-horned sheep, which are said to have\r\ndescended from some washed ashore from the Armada. I was glad to go\r\nagain with Lady Egerton to Arley, where the beautiful gardens, really\r\nmodern, have all the picturesqueness of antiquity. It is typical of the\r\nkindness which old Mr. Warburton shows in everything that all round the\r\nroads on his estate he leaves open spaces with plenty of brambles for\r\nblackberry gatherers.\r\n\r\n“Lord Donington told Lady Egerton that when he went to live where he\r\ndoes now, his two young boys were taught by an admirable English\r\ngoverness. One day, having observed the housekeeper carefully locking\r\nthe door of a spare bedroom, she casually said, ‘Do you always keep the\r\ndoors of the unused bedrooms locked?’--‘No,’ said the housekeeper, ‘only\r\nthis one;’ and she invited the governess to look into it, saying that\r\nthere was a mystery about it. Some one always seemed to come to sleep\r\nthere, whom she could not imagine, and she believed some trick was being\r\nplayed upon her. As an experiment, she said she would be very much\r\nobliged if the governess would take away the key after the room was\r\nlocked, and keep it till the following morning. The next day they went\r\ntogether to the room, which showed every appearance of having been slept\r\nin, yet the window was carefully fastened inside, and there was no other\r\npossible entrance.\r\n\r\n“Some time after, a young man came to shoot with the boys, and was put\r\ninto that room. In the morning he came down with a very scared look, and\r\nsaid he was very sorry, but he must leave. Being much pressed, he\r\nallowed that he had been dreadfully frightened. He had kept his candle\r\nby his bed to finish a book he had been reading, and, looking up, he saw\r\nan old man sitting by the fire, who eventually rose, came, looked into\r\nthe bed, and seeing him there, walked away. ‘And,’ said the visitor,\r\n‘_that_ is the man!’ pointing to a picture on the wall of an ancestor\r\nwho had died centuries before.\r\n\r\n“Amongst the guests at Tatton were a Mr. and Mrs. Crum, most delightful\r\npeople. He had made a fortune as a manufacturer, and they now live at\r\nBroxton Old Hall, a dower-house and beautiful old black and white manor\r\nof Sir Philip Egerton’s, whither I went to visit them. Thence I saw Mr.\r\nWolley Dodd’s wonderful garden, the most interesting herbaceous\r\ncollection in England. Mr. Wolley, well known as an Eton master, married\r\nMiss Dodd, the heiress of Edge, and of a family which has lived there\r\nfrom Saxon times, and of which a member was knighted at Agincourt; and\r\nhe has turned a farmyard, a quarry, a pond, a wood, &c., into the most\r\nastonishing of gardens, in which each genus of plants is provided with\r\nthe exact soil it loves best, and grows as it never does elsewhere. Near\r\nEdge we saw the noble old black and white house of Carden. We also saw\r\nthe once splendid church of Malpas, utterly ruined by its so-called\r\n‘restoration’ under a Chester architect named Douglas--old pavements,\r\nold pews ruthlessly destroyed, and a vestry by Vanbrugh only spared for\r\nwant of funds to pull it down. A miserable window commemorates Reginald\r\nHeber, once rector, and a lime avenue leads to his rectory. I was\r\nseveral days at Drayton as I returned--most beautiful and interesting.\r\n\r\n“C. writes to me for advice, but I feel more and more diffident about\r\ngiving any. I found such a capital bit about this in a novel called\r\n‘Margaret Maliphant,’ the other day. The old servant Deborah says, ‘What\r\nyou think’s the right way most times turns out to be the wrong way; and\r\nwhen you make folks turn to the right when they was minded to turn to\r\nthe left, it’s most like the left would have been the best way for them\r\nto travel after all. I’ve done advisin’ long ago; for it’s a queer tract\r\nof country here below, and every one has to take their own chance in the\r\nlong-run.’\r\n\r\n“_How_ tiresome the shibboleth which many clergymen talk in church is!\r\nMr. ---- has been dwelling upon the exceeding _sinfulness of sin_. We\r\n_may_ find a meaning for this, but is it in fact different from the\r\n_beautifulness of beauty_, which we should call nonsense?”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ LOUISA, MARCHIONESS OF WATERFORD.\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 30, 1890._--I had a pleasant visit at St. Audries, Sir A. Acland\r\nHood’s beautiful place. It is a red sandstone house, enfolded amongst\r\ngreen hills, chiefly covered with golden or russet woods or rich growth\r\nof arbutus, and in front is the sea. In the morning-room are Turner’s\r\nwater-colour pictures of Sussex (including one of Hurstmonceaux),\r\nexecuted for Mr. Fuller of Rosehill, of whom, with two other fortunes,\r\nLady Hood was the heiress. In a corner of the hall are baby-clothes of\r\nthree boys beneath the portrait of another remote ancestor, Edward\r\nPalmer of Ightham Mote. One Whitsunday morning a servant came in and\r\nsaid, ‘Sir, your lady has presented you with a son.’--‘The most joyful\r\nnews you could have brought me!’ said Mr. Palmer. The following Sunday\r\nthe servant came again: ‘Sir, your lady has presented you with another\r\nson.’--‘Oh, God bless my soul! you don’t say so?’ exclaimed Mr. Palmer.\r\nBut the third Sunday the servant came in with ‘Sir, your lady has\r\npresented you with another son.’ It seemed quite too much; but the\r\nbabies all lived, and grew up to be very distinguished men, being all\r\nknighted for their valour by Henry VIII.[494] I was delightfully taken\r\nabout--to Crowcombe, where the Carew heiress has married Cranmer\r\nTrollope, and where there are noble Vandykes and a fine Titian portrait:\r\nto Quantockshead, with a delightful old hall and carved chimney-pieces:\r\nand to Nettlecombe, where the old hall of the Catholic Sir Alfred\r\nTrevelyan nestles close to the parish church. Sir Alfred described how\r\nthe ‘church restorers’ at Bideford had turned all that was worth having\r\nout of the church. A figure of a man was bought by an old woman, but she\r\nthought it was too undressed and kept it--in bed! There it was found\r\nwith its head comfortably laid on the pillow, a figure of St. John\r\nBaptist. The old woman had some notion of its value, as she asked £600\r\nfor it; but it was well worth that, as it was a priceless Donatello!\r\n\r\n“All about this neighbourhood it is the same thing. Sir A. Hood had been\r\nto see a friend of his, and remarked, ‘What a pretty and peculiar\r\nflower-stand you have.’--‘Yes,’ said the friend, ‘and an interesting one\r\ntoo, for it is the font of Ongar church, in which Gunthran the Dane was\r\nbaptized, and by which King Alfred stood as his sponsor.’\r\n\r\n“Mr. W. Neville, who was one of the guests at St. Audries, had been to\r\nhear Dr. Parker, of the Congregational Hall, preach. He began his sermon\r\nby saying, ‘My brethren, I have received a letter from a gentleman\r\nsaying that he intends to be present to-day and to make a philosophical\r\nanalysis of my discourse to you. I am sure you will all sympathise with\r\nme in the embarrassment and nervousness which I must experience on such\r\nan occasion, though certainly I may derive some little comfort from the\r\nfact that my correspondent spells “philosophical” with an _f_.’\r\n\r\n“Mr. Neville told me that he had asked a boy in his parish what was the\r\ndifference between the head and the stomach. ‘The head has brains in it,\r\nif the owner has any,’ replied the boy; ‘the stomach has bowels; they\r\nare five--_a-e-i-o-u_.’\r\n\r\n“It was only a drive from St. Audries to Dunster, where I spent three\r\ndays, and which is, as Charlie Halifax has often described it, quite the\r\nmost beautiful place in the south of England. It is an old castle, of\r\nwhich the earlier parts are of Edward I., on a great height, rising from\r\nglorious evergreen woods, with a view of the sea on one side and russet\r\nmoorland on the other: in the depth, on one side, a tossing crystalline\r\nriver and old pointed bridge; on the other, the town with its ancient\r\nmarket-house and glorious church. I slept in ‘King Charles’s Room,’ in a\r\ngreat carved bed. The cottages in the villages around are covered with\r\nmyrtle, coronilla, and geranium.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Stucley, one of the Fanes of Clovelly, was at St. Audries. She\r\ntold me that one Sunday their clergyman preached entirely on\r\nThermopylae, and wound up by saying that the Spartans were much the\r\nbravest men that ever lived; that there was never any battle like\r\nThermopylae. Afterwards, at luncheon, Colonel Stucley said he did not\r\nagree with what the preacher had said, for all the Thespians perished,\r\nwhilst the Spartans survived: had the Thespians survived, they might\r\nhave proved as good as their rivals.\r\n\r\n“Three weeks afterwards the clergyman surprised the Stucleys by saying,\r\n‘Well, my case is proved. I’ve the opinion of the greatest Greek scholar\r\nof the age--Mr. Gladstone--that it is as I stated it, that the Spartans\r\nwere the bravest.’ He had actually written to Mr. Gladstone, and\r\nproduced the answer.\r\n\r\n“Afterwards Mrs. Stucley was dining out in London, and went down with\r\nMr. Godley, one of Gladstone’s secretaries. She said, ‘I am afraid my\r\nname may not be unknown to you?’--‘Oh,’ he said, ‘Thermopylae,’ and went\r\non to tell that when one of the secretaries opened the letter, they all\r\ndiscussed the question, and not being able to agree, took it in to Mr.\r\nGladstone, who was so excited by it that he left his finance and all\r\nelse, and walked about for three hours talking of nothing but\r\nThermopylae.\r\n\r\n“Except the Lefevres and Brasseys, I think my Dunster visit is the only\r\ntime I have ever stayed in a Radical house; but its mistress, Mrs.\r\nLuttrell, with the support of her own family twelve miles off, holds out\r\nas a Conservative.\r\n\r\n“From Somersetshire I went to Hatfield, arriving just after sunset. You\r\ncould only just see the red colouring on the majestic old house, but all\r\nthe windows blazed and glittered with light through the dark walls; the\r\nGolden Gallery with its hundreds of electric lamps was like a Venetian\r\nillumination. The many guests coming and going, the curiously varied\r\nnames inscribed upon the bedroom doors, give the effect of having all\r\nthe elements of society compressed under one roof. It was pleasant to\r\nmeet Lady Lytton, beautiful still, and with all the charm of the most\r\nhigh-bred refinement. Another guest was Count Herbert Bismarck. Lady\r\nSalisbury had spoken of him as a fallen power, greatly broken by his\r\nfall, and so had enlisted our sympathies for him, but he quenched them\r\nby his loud authoritative manner, flinging every sentence from him with\r\ndefiant self-assertion. He was especially opinionated about Henry\r\nVIII.’s wives, utterly refusing to allow that Anne of Cleves did not\r\nprecede Anne Boleyn. He is a colossal man and a great eater, and would\r\nalways fill two glasses of wine at once, to have one in reserve. At\r\ndinner he was rather amusing about the inefficiency of doctors, and said\r\nthat the only time when cause follows effect was when a doctor follows\r\nthe funeral of his patient. Lord Selborne, who was sitting near, spoke\r\nof Baron Munchausen, how he took the whole College of Physicians up in\r\nhis balloon, and kept them there a month, and then, when he sent them\r\ndown again out of pity for their patients, found all their patients had\r\ngot quite well in their absence, but that all the undertakers were\r\nruined.\r\n\r\n“The life of a Prime Minister’s family is certainly no sinecure. Lady\r\nSalisbury and her daughter have constantly to go off to found or open\r\ncharities of every description. Lord Salisbury is occupied with his\r\nsecretaries to the very last moment before breakfast and luncheon, into\r\nwhich he walks stooping, with hands folded behind him, and a deeply\r\nmeditative countenance, and by his side the great boar-hound called\r\n‘Pharaoh’--‘because he will not let the people go;’ but when once seated\r\nas a host, he wakes up into the most interesting and animated\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“How cold it is! but, as Mr. Bennett has been saying in Curzon Street\r\nChapel, ‘Winter is like the pause of the instrument; not the paralysis,\r\nbut the preparation of Nature.’ These sermons at Curzon Street are one\r\nof the greatest interests of London now. Last Sunday’s was on\r\n‘anonymous sins.’ ‘How many there are,’ said the preacher, ‘even in\r\nfashionable life, who say, “Lord, I will follow Thee, I mean to follow\r\nThee ... but ...;”’ and proceeded to describe how ‘the future of the\r\nworld depends upon its unknown saints.’ Very different are these from\r\nthe nonsensical sermons one often hears about ‘the awful circumstances\r\nof the times,’ interlarded with prophetic texts.\r\n\r\n“There has been a long and amusing Review of my ‘France’ in the\r\n_Speaker_, reproaching me with my Roman Catholic tendencies, as evinced\r\nin the length of my account of Ars and its Curé, the writer being\r\nevidently unconscious that for every English traveller who lingers at\r\nLyons, at least a hundred (Catholics) turn aside to Ars. This Review is\r\nnoticed in an American paper, which says, ‘As a matter of fact, Mr. Hare\r\nis a well-known Low Church clergyman, who _poses at clerical meetings as\r\nan advanced Evangelical_!’ The other Reviews seem to have been mostly\r\nwritten by men who knew nothing of the subject, and who have not taken\r\nthe trouble to know more of the book than, at most, the first chapter.\r\nOne of them asserts that ‘the illustrations, said to be taken from\r\noriginal sketches, are evidently all from photographs’ (!); but ‘j’ai\r\npour principe que le radotage des sots ne tire pas à conséquence,’ as\r\nErnest Renan says.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ LOUISA, MARCHIONESS OF WATERFORD.\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 7, 1890._--I have had an interesting visit to the De Capel\r\nBrookes in the old grey Tudor house of Great Oakley Hall in\r\nNorthamptonshire. Thence I saw two of the finest houses in England.\r\nRushton (Mr. Clarke Thornhill’s) is a great Tudor house with a screen\r\nlike that of a Genoese palace. In the garden is ‘Dryden’s Walk,’ and the\r\nthree-cornered lodge built by Richard Tresham (with Lyveden and the\r\ntown-hall of Rothwell) as a strange votive offering to propitiate the\r\nTrinity for success in the enterprise of the Gunpowder Plot. Rockingham\r\nis even more interesting. Once the hunting-palace of King John, it was\r\ninhabited ever afterwards by the English kings till the time of Henry\r\nVII., since which the Watsons have possessed it. The position is\r\nsplendid, with a wide view of map-like Northamptonshire country, and it\r\nis approached by a gateway between noble Plantagenet towers. All\r\nadditions have been made in the best taste, and the great drawing-room\r\nis magnificent. King John’s treasure-chest remains in the hall. There is\r\na noble Sir Joshua, and a most beautiful Angelica Kauffmann, probably\r\nher finest work. Other interesting pictures came to the Watsons through\r\nmarriages, many of Lord Strafford and his surroundings through the\r\nmarriage of his daughter with Lord Rockingham; those of Henry Pelham,\r\nthe Duke of Newcastle, &c., through the daughter of the former.\r\n\r\n“How interesting is the Parnell crisis! At Miss Seymour’s I met a\r\nCountess Ziski, who talked of how curious it was that abroad, if a woman\r\nmisconducts herself, she is boycotted, but no notice is taken of the\r\nmisconduct of the man: here, if a woman misconducts herself, an\r\neasy-going society makes excuses for her, but the man is cashiered for\r\never.\r\n\r\n“The Dean of Chester says that a friend of his was once baptizing a\r\nchild of six. All went well, till it came to making the sign of the\r\ncross, when the child exclaimed, ‘If you do that again, I’ll hit yer in\r\nthe eye.’ At a recent Board-school examination ‘Education’ was defined\r\nas ‘that which enables you to despise the opinions of others, and\r\nconduces to situations of considerable emolument.’ I think it was Miss\r\nCobbe who defined ‘Conscience’ as ‘that which supplies you with an\r\nexcellent motive for doing that which you desire to do, and which fills\r\nyou with self-satisfaction when you have done it.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ W. H. MILLIGAN.\r\n\r\n“_Llandaff, Dec. 18, 1890._--I was a week at Ammerdown, meeting Lord and\r\nLady Temple, the Phelips’s of Montacute, and a charming Miss Devereux,\r\nLord Hereford’s daughter.... The Dean of ---- had been out with a\r\nshooting party in the neighbourhood. ‘I hope you sent some pheasants the\r\nDean’s way,’ said the owner of the ground to a keeper. ‘Oh yes, that I\r\nhave, and his holiness has been pepperin’ away as stiff as a biscuit.’\r\n\r\n“Here at Llandaff it has been interesting to meet Mr. Herbert Ward of\r\nthe African Stanley rearguard, a most frank, simple, and evidently most\r\ntruthful fellow, who speaks with great moderation of the leader of the\r\nexpedition, to whom they owed so much of suffering, misery, death, and\r\nslander.\r\n\r\n“Have you never remarked how hypnotism is described in Wisdom xvii.?”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ LOUISA, MARCHIONESS OF WATERFORD.\r\n\r\n“_Honingham, Norfolk, January 8, 1891._--I enjoyed my Christmas visit to\r\nthe Lowthers, though it was rather spoilt by what novelists would call\r\nthe incipient agonies of a cold, which has about attained its perfection\r\nnow, and I am glad to be in this warm house of the hospitable Ailwyn\r\nFellowes’s, where I am well looked after.\r\n\r\n“I heard such a capital story of Bishop Magee the other day. He was in a\r\ncarriage on the Great Western with two young clergymen, one of whom\r\nbegan, and went on violently abusing the Bishop of Peterborough by name,\r\nwithout observing who he was. At Swindon the Bishop got out to have some\r\nsoup. When he was gone, the other curate said, ‘How could you go on like\r\nthat? couldn’t you see that _was_ the Bishop of Peterborough?’--‘Why\r\ndidn’t you stop me?’--‘Well, I did all I could; I’m sure I kicked you\r\nhard enough.’--‘What _can_ I do?’--‘Well, if I was you, I should\r\napologise.’ So, when the Bishop came back, the young man said, ‘I’m very\r\nsorry, my Lord, to have said all I did in your presence. I am sure I had\r\nnot an idea who you were, and if there is anything you especially\r\nobjected to, I should be very glad to withdraw it and\r\napologise.’--‘Well,’ said the Bishop, ‘there was one thing, there\r\ncertainly was one thing which annoyed me very much: you _would_ call me\r\nMajee; now my name is Magee!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlas! the shadows which I had observed during my last visit to my dear\r\nfriend Lady Waterford were now gathering very thickly around her. She\r\nhad failed rapidly from the time of her removal from Highcliffe to her\r\nNorthumbrian home, and was no longer able to answer me; but I still\r\nwrote to her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ LOUISA, MARCHIONESS OF WATERFORD.\r\n\r\n“_Athenaeum Club, March 1, 1891._--I am thankful still to hear of you\r\nfrom many common friends, and quite satisfied without hearing from\r\nyourself, and rejoice to think of you as able to enjoy drives. I think\r\nyou will often find out, by carriage, points which will be almost new to\r\nyou, and I can imagine how lovely the effects must have been in the hazy\r\nhollows of the Cheviots in these last days, when even here sunshine has\r\nbroken through the fog in which London was shrouded for a week. It is\r\nSunday, and I am just going to Curzon Street Chapel. I would not miss\r\none of Mr. Bennett’s sermons on any account.... The one which struck me\r\nmost was on the brief text ‘Nothing but leaves!’--so many bear those,\r\nquite a great growth of them, and no more: I am sure I do.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 16._--Two days ago I ran in from this Club to luncheon at the\r\nBrownlows’ close by, and had such a pleasant visit.\r\n\r\n“I went first into the large room they call the library on the ground\r\nfloor--the most enchanting of rooms, hung all round with noble Italian\r\npictures, some of them bequeathed by Miss Talbot, and bright with many\r\nflowers; some of your prettiest drawings on the table; Westminster\r\nAbbey, faint, grey, and impressive, beyond the leafless trees outside\r\nthe window. Here I found Lord Pembroke, always as genial, pleasant, and\r\ncharming as he is handsome.\r\n\r\n“The staircase is quite beautiful, chiefly designed by Lord Brownlow,\r\nbut partly taken from the old palace-inn at Parma, with friezes and\r\nalcoves, and lighted by a copy of Michelangelo’s lanthorn. In the wide\r\ngallery above we found Lady Brownlow. Her two sisters came in, and then\r\nwe had luncheon.\r\n\r\n“Afterwards we went to the pretty little sitting-room, full of beautiful\r\nthings, which is called Lady Lothian’s. What an attractive group the\r\nsisters made--the pale, spiritual, abstracted Lady Lothian, the very\r\ntype of refined gentleness: Lady Brownlow, with her noble Bronzino-like\r\nhead and colouring, and the figure of a classic caryatide: Lady\r\nPembroke, less interesting at first, but so intensely _grande dame_; and\r\nthen the two husbands leaning over them, on such happy, devoted terms\r\nwith all three, were such noble specimens of humanity. The conversation\r\nthere is delightful--so un-Londony, so original, so high-minded and\r\nhigh-meaning.\r\n\r\n“To-day I have been to Edward Clifford’s studio to see his drawings and\r\nhis Burne-Jones’s--all of the usual lean, limp, scared-woman kind. What\r\nwas more interesting was the handsome, radiant, bright-eyed elderly\r\nwoman who was looking over the drawings: it was the famous Madame\r\nNovikoff. I had much talk with her, and found her most simple and\r\nattractive, and not the least an alarming person.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was on the day after writing this that I first truly realised that my\r\ndearest Lady’s illness must be fatal. Our Lady was told that it must be\r\nso, that the end might come any day, any hour. At first she shed a few\r\nnatural tears, and said, “I thought I should have lived to\r\nseventy-seven, as my mother did,” and then added sweetly, “But why\r\nshould I mind, since God so wills it? tell me how it will be.”--“Perhaps\r\nin your chair, just as you are sitting now.”--“Oh, that will be well--so\r\nquiet, so well.” One day soon afterwards she wished to go out into the\r\ngarden when it was not thought good for her. “Perhaps you might die when\r\nyou are out.”--“And why should it not be like that? If God called me in\r\nthe garden, it would be as well as in any other place.” I could not go\r\nto Ford, because Lady Waterford was not allowed to see any one\r\nunnecessarily, but for many weeks succeeding my whole heart was there\r\nwith the faithful friend, the kind sympathiser, the constant\r\ncorrespondent of thirty years. One heard of the gradual increase of the\r\ndisease: of her laying aside all painting and writing: of her reading\r\nprayers to her servants for the last time; but still talking in her wise\r\nand beautiful way of all things “lovely and of good report,” laughing\r\nbrightly over old recollections: then of her lying constantly on a sofa,\r\nalways rejoicing to see those she loved, but mistaking her younger\r\nrelations for their mothers, dear to her in the long ago. Often also\r\nothers, those dearest to her, who had gone before, appeared to be\r\npresent with her as angel ministrants to cheer and comfort. The sweet\r\nface of old Lady Stuart, her mother, seemed visibly present: she\r\nimagined her old governess to be in the house, and bade Miss Lindsay to\r\nbe sure to arrange for the drives which she knew the old lady liked.\r\nThrough the flowers upon her table she constantly saw her sister\r\nCharlotte, Lady Canning, in all her loveliness. Her sense of the\r\ncompanionship of this beloved sister was so vivid, and she spoke of her\r\nso often, that at last one of those present thought it necessary to say\r\nto her, “Dear lady, Lady Canning died very many years ago.” “Oh, did\r\nshe? How delightful! then I shall soon be able to talk to her. I see her\r\nnow, but soon we shall talk as we used to do.” One evening there was a\r\nbeautiful sunset. Our dear Lady sat watching it. “It is like the coming\r\nof the Lord,” she said. Surely the watchers at Ford realised General\r\nGordon’s words--“Any one to whom God gives to be much with Him, cannot\r\neven suffer a pang at the approach of death. For what is death to a\r\nbeliever? It is a closer approach to Him whom, even through the veil,\r\nhe is ever with.”\r\n\r\nMr. Neville, the rector of Ford, prayed with her daily. “How I wish that\r\nothers might have the solace this is to me,” she said, with her peculiar\r\nemphasis on the word “solace.”\r\n\r\nLady Brownlow was with her three days, and was her last visitor: she\r\ncame away saying it had been like being in a beautiful church, so\r\npervading was the sense of holiness. “Oh, darling Adelaide! goodness and\r\nbeauty, beauty and goodness: those are ever the great things!” were our\r\ndear Lady’s last words to her, as she took her hands and gazed at her\r\nearnestly. They were very characteristic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ LOUISA, MARCHIONESS OF WATERFORD.\r\n\r\n“_April 12, 1891._--How often my thoughts go to Ford, and how well I can\r\nimagine all that surrounds you there--the snowy Cheviots, that pretty\r\nlittle garden in the bastion tower, the warm bright library; most of all\r\nthe constant care of Miss Thompson and Miss Lindsay. I am so glad I know\r\nit so well, and have so many memories of happy visits--in the old\r\ncastle, in the cottage with dear Lady Stuart, in the renewed castle\r\nsince. I seem to see you this bright Sunday morning, and hope it is as\r\nbright with you. Inwardly I am sure the sun is shining, and that the\r\nSaviour you have loved so well is very near you in hours of weakness. I\r\noften wish I could do something--anything--for you, but I can only\r\nthink of you with ever-grateful love, and pray that all may be peaceful\r\nand smooth with you.\r\n\r\n“Lady Bloomfield is feeling the loss of her old friend Mrs. Hogg,[495]\r\nbut she had the most gentle and peaceful end, just talking to her sister\r\nand daughter very calmly and quietly without any pain or fear, and then\r\nfalling sweetly asleep and not waking....\r\n\r\n“‘The Blessed Trinity have you in his keeping,’ as Margaret Paston wrote\r\nin 1461.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_April 26._--Another week of bitter cold and biting winds, and I fear\r\nyou will have been the worse for them. Your state of suspension from so\r\nmuch that you used to be able to do so constantly recalls that of my\r\ndearest mother--in winter--for many years; but when the limbs seemed\r\nleast helpful, and eyes and hands least active, all happy memories of\r\nher wealthy past seemed brighter to her, and she was always able to find\r\ncomfort in the feeling that ‘they also serve who only stand and wait.’\r\n... I know that, to the weakest, Christ can give such blessed assurance\r\nof His love, that in the joy of it all pain and fear are unfelt and\r\nvanish. Oh, would that I could do anything for you, but you know how\r\nmuch I always am your most affectionate and grateful\r\n\r\n“A. J. C. H.”\r\n\r\nThis letter was read to our Lady: then I was told to write no more. The\r\nend was very near, and each hour became filled with a tensity of\r\nwaiting for the silent summons. There were none of the ordinary signs of\r\nan illness. Our Lady suffered no pain at all, scarcely even discomfort.\r\nHer former beauty returned to her, only in a more majestic form, the\r\nsigns of age seeming to be smoothed away, except in the grey hair half\r\nhidden by soft lace. She rarely spoke, and noticed little except the\r\nbeauty of the flowers by which she was surrounded. But when she did\r\nspeak, those with her knew that, with entire and humblest prostration of\r\nself at the foot of the Cross, her faith and hope had never been\r\nbrighter. She looked beyond the snowy hills into a sky of unearthly\r\nbeauty. And so, peacefully, radiantly, our dearest Lady fell into the\r\never-smiling unconsciousness, in which, on May 11th, she passed away\r\nfrom us to join the beloved and honoured who are at rest with Christ. As\r\nI think of her, some lines come back to me which I read to her on my\r\nlast morning at Ford:--\r\n\r\n    “Now for all waiting hours\r\n       Well am I comforted,\r\n     For of a surety now I see\r\n       That, without dire distress\r\n       Of tears or weariness,\r\n     My Lady verily awaiteth me:\r\n     So that, until with her I be,\r\n       For my dear Lady’s sake\r\n       I am right fain to make\r\n     Out of my pain a pillow, and to take\r\n     Grief for a golden garment unto me;\r\n       Knowing that I, at last, shall stand\r\n       In that green garden-land,\r\n     And, in the holding of my Lady’s hand,\r\n     Forget the grieving and the misery.”[496]\r\n\r\nI should have gone to Ford afterwards, but our Lady only died on Monday,\r\nand it was late on Wednesday night before I heard that she was to be\r\nburied on Thursday afternoon, so to arrive in time was impossible. Miss\r\nLindsay wrote to me how her coffin was carried on the shoulders of her\r\nown labourers to the churchyard, how all the village and all her\r\ntenantry came to her funeral, with the few intimate friends within\r\nreach, and how Helmore’s music was sung. It was well the end was at\r\nFord. Highcliffe is a rapidly changing place, and it has already passed\r\nto comparative strangers; but at Ford she will always be _the_ Lady\r\nWaterford, “the good, the dear Lady Waterford.”\r\n\r\nThere our Lady rests, within view of her own Cheviots, surrounded by the\r\naffectionate Border people, to whom their “Border Queen” was their\r\ngreatest pride and interest and joy. An aching void will remain in our\r\nhearts through life, but it is only for our poor selves. When one thinks\r\nof her, earth fades and vanishes, and if--when one is alone--one allows\r\noneself to think, to dwell upon all the glory of what she _was_, an\r\nall-pervading sense of peace and holiness comes upon one, and one seems,\r\nfor the moment, almost to pass into the Land of Beulah--into the higher\r\nlife, without worry or vexation, where she _is_.\r\n\r\nWhen her things were being distributed, the distributors were surprised\r\nto hear that “the odd man” most earnestly begged for something: it was\r\nfor her old sealskin jacket. It was thought a most singular request at\r\nfirst, but he urged it very much: he should “treasure the jacket as long\r\nas ever he lived.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOMB OF LADY WATERFORD, FORD.]\r\n\r\nHe had been walking by her donkey-chair in the road, when they found a\r\nfemale tramp lying in the ditch, very ill indeed. Lady Waterford got out\r\nof her chair and made the man help her to lift the poor woman into it.\r\nThen she took off her own jacket, and put it upon the sick woman, and\r\nwalked home by the side of the chair, tending and comforting her all the\r\nway. “But it was not my Lady’s putting her jacket on the woman that I\r\ncared about,” said the man, “but that she did not consider her jacket\r\nthe least polluted by having been worn by the tramp; _she wore it\r\nherself afterwards_ as if nothing had happened.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\nSOCIAL REMINISCENCES\r\n\r\n     “Napoleon used to say that what was most fatal to a general was the\r\n     knack of combining objects into pictures. A good officer, he said,\r\n     never makes pictures; he sees objects, as through a field-glass,\r\n     exactly as they are.”--_Macmillan_, No. 306.\r\n\r\n     “Small causes are sufficient to make a man uneasy when great ones\r\n     are not in the way. For want of a block, he will stumble on a\r\n     straw.”--SWIFT.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Errors like straws upon the surface flow,\r\n     He who would search for pearls must dive below.”\r\n                   --DRYDEN.\r\n\r\n_To the_ HON. G. JOLLIFE.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, August 1891._--I enjoyed my months in London at the time,\r\nyet was very glad to come away. It is a terrible waste of life. The size\r\nand lateness of dinners have killed society. Scarcely any one says\r\nanything worth hearing, and if any one does, nobody listens.\r\n\r\n“‘Que de bonnes choses vont tous les jours mourir dans l’oreille d’un\r\nsot,’ was always a true saying of Fontenelle, but is less true now than\r\nformerly--there are so few _bonnes choses_.\r\n\r\n“People love talking, but not talk. Dinners are rather display than\r\nhospitality, supplying abundance of sumptuous viands, but no _esprit_.\r\nI heard pleasanter conversation in one quiet luncheon at the Speaker’s\r\nfrom his delightful family than at a hundred parties: as a social art it\r\nis extinct. One never hears such conversationalists as gathered round my\r\naunt Mrs. Stanley’s homely table long ago, or as, in later times, round\r\nArthur Stanley, Mrs. Grote, Madame Mohl, the first Lady Carnarvon, Lord\r\nHoughton, Lady Margaret Beaumont. The dinners, in food sense, have never\r\nany attraction to me. L. and I dined out together at ---- and I think it\r\nwas an even match which of us suffered most, L. or myself: myself,\r\nbecause the dinner was too good; L., because it was not good enough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OAK WALK, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n“From what I hear from the East End, the scandal of Tranby Croft seems\r\nto be acting as the _affaire du collier_ did in France in preparing the\r\nway for a revolution. But the West End goes on as if nothing had\r\nhappened. I saw the Emperor (of Germany) several times, a fat young man\r\nwith a bright good-humoured face, though apparently never free from the\r\noppression of his own importance, as well as of the importance of his\r\ndress, which he changes very often in the day. And I went, one glorious\r\nafternoon, when the limes were in blossom, with several thousand other\r\npeople to Hatfield to meet the Prince of Naples, whose intelligence\r\n(especially on subjects connected with Natural History) seems to have\r\npleased everybody. He is very small, but has none of the aggressive\r\nugliness of his father and grandfather. One day I went to luncheon with\r\nMiss Rhoda Broughton, who is seen at her very best in her little house\r\nat Richmond, most attractive in its old prints and furniture and lovely\r\nriver view. Then I spent a Sunday with my cousin Theresa Earle in her\r\npretty Surrey home, and wound up the season by meeting a large party at\r\nCobham.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VENETIAN WELL, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER (_æt._ 94).\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Sept. 2, 1891._--You will imagine how your birthday makes\r\nme think of you, and how much I give thanks for the blessing which your\r\nlove and kindness has been to us for so many years. I like to think of\r\nyou on your peaceful sofa, and I know you are like John Wilson Croker,\r\nwho, when some one remarked in his presence that death was an awful\r\nthing, said, ‘I do not feel it so. The same Hand which took care of me\r\nwhen I came into this world will take care of me when I go out of it.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ W. H. MILLIGAN, _and Note-book_.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Oct. 1891._--I have returned from my autumn visits, which\r\nhave been delightful. The Watsons, who live at Rockingham, the old royal\r\npalace of the Midlands, are well worthy of its noble rooms and its\r\nbrilliant gardens, relieved against the quaintest of yew hedges.\r\n\r\n“At Hovingham, in Yorkshire, I found Mrs. Lowther, and we sketched\r\ntogether very happily. It is an unusual great house, approached through\r\na riding-school and a sculpture gallery, which contains a huge work of\r\nGiovanni da Bologna and the loveliest little Greek statue in England.\r\nGenial Sir William Worsley, the adopted uncle of all the nicest young\r\nladies in the county, is a centre of love and goodness, and his\r\nsaint-like wife, crippled and utterly motionless from chronic\r\nrheumatism, is the sunshine of all around her. Most quaint are some of\r\nthe old-fashioned dependants. The old coachman seriously asked his\r\nmaster, ‘Is it true, Sir William, that Baron Rothschild was refused when\r\nhe offered to pay the whole of the natural debt if he might drive eight\r\nhorses like the Queen, instead of seven horses and a mule?’\r\n\r\n“We saw Gilling, the fine old Fairfax castle, and spent a delicious day\r\nat Rievaulx. Sir William has oratorios(!) annually performed in his\r\nriding-school.\r\n\r\n“I arrived at Bishopthorpe the day before the Archbishop’s enthronement,\r\nand found a large party of relations assembling; but it would be\r\ndifficult to crowd the house, as there are forty bedrooms and the\r\ndining-room is huge. The palace lies low, and out of the dining-room\r\nwindow you could very nearly fish in the Ouse, which often floods the\r\ncellars, the only part remaining of the original house of Walter de\r\nGray. The rococo gateway is imposed by guidebooks upon the uninitiated\r\nas that of Wolsey’s palace at Cawood: perhaps a few of its ornaments\r\ncame from thence. The ceremony in the Minster was very imposing, the\r\nmore so as a military escort was given to the Archbishop, as having been\r\nan old soldier. Most moving was his address upon the responsibilities,\r\nand what he felt to be the duties, of his office. The ebb and flow of\r\nprocessional music was beautiful, as the long stream of choristers and\r\nclergy flowed in and out of the Minster. The Archbishop’s brothers--one\r\nof them, Sir Douglas-Maclagan, being eighty--made a very remarkable\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n“Most happy and interesting were my four succeeding days at Hickleton,\r\nwhere I met one of the familiar circles of people I always connect with\r\nCharlie Halifax--Lady Ernestine Edgecumbe, Lady Morton, Canon and Lady\r\nCaroline Courtenay, the Haygarths. More characteristic still of the host\r\nwas the presence of a nun in full canonicals--Sister Caroline--‘this\r\nreligious,’ as Charlie called her--who appeared at meals, though only to\r\npartake of a rabbit’s diet. In the churchyard a great crucifix, twelve\r\nfeet high, is being erected, and the people of Doncaster do not come out\r\nto stone it; on the contrary, the crucifix and its adjuncts attract\r\nlarge congregations of pitmen, who would not go to church at all\r\notherwise; and the neighbourhood is beginning to wonder how long the\r\nChurch of England can dare to deny its Lord by condemning the crucifix,\r\nthe vacant cross being but the frame of the picture with the portrait\r\nleft out, and in itself an eloquent protest against the omission.\r\nAnother smaller crucifix commemorates the three dear boys who have ‘gone\r\nhome.’ The shadow of their great loss here is ever present, but it is\r\ntruly a sanctified grief: their memory is kept ever fresh and the\r\nthought of them sunny, and thus they still seem to have their\r\npart--invisible--in the daily life, upon which their beautiful pictured\r\nsemblances look down from the walls of their home. Only a deep sudden\r\nsigh from the father now and then recalls all he has undergone. The\r\nshort morning services in the house-chapel, with its huge crucifix from\r\nOber-Ammergau, where the household sing in parts, are very touching.\r\nStill more so are the Sunday services in the beautiful church, close to\r\nthe house, the low mass, then the full surpliced choir and the blazing\r\nlights, and the holy rood above the reredos glittering through them in a\r\ngolden glamour. In the darker aisle where we sat were the sleeping\r\nalabaster figures of the late Lord and Lady Halifax upon their great\r\naltar-tomb, and near me the dearest friend of my long-ago was\r\nkneeling--a stainless knight--in a rapt devotion which seemed to carry\r\nhim far into the unseen. I could only feel, as Inglesant at Little\r\nGidding, the presence of a peace and glory utterly unearthly, and as if\r\nthere--as nowhere else--Heaven took possession of one and entered into\r\none’s soul.\r\n\r\n“A journey through the Fen country took me to Campsea Ashe, where the\r\nartistic party collected in the pleasant Lowther home spent a most\r\npleasant week in drawing--studying--by the silent moats of old-timbered\r\nhouses--Parham, Seckford, and Otley. We went also to the attractive old\r\ntown of Woodbridge, where Percy Fitzgerald lived, who wrote so many\r\ncapital articles. A characteristic story told of him is that he once\r\nspent the evening in the company of a bore who buzzed on incessantly\r\nabout this lord and that till he could bear it no longer and left the\r\nroom, but as he did so, opened the door once more, and, putting in his\r\nhead, said, ‘_I_ knew a lord once, but he’s dead!’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BISHOP’S BRIDGE, NORWICH.][497]\r\n\r\n“I was at Felixstowe for a day afterwards, and made\r\nacquaintance--friends, I hope--with Felix Cobbold, a most attractive\r\nfellow, with a delightful house, and a garden close above the sea, which\r\ntruly makes ‘the desert smile’ in that most hideous of all sea-places.\r\nThen I was a night at the Palace at Norwich, full of childish\r\nreminiscence to me, and most stately and beautiful it all looked--the\r\nsmooth lawns and bright flowers, the grand grey cathedral and soaring\r\nspire, the old chapel and ruin; only the palace itself has had all the\r\npicturesqueness washed out of it. Its geography is entirely altered, but\r\nit was delightful to recognise old nooks and corners, and I almost\r\nseemed to see my Mother sitting by the old-fashioned chimney-piece in\r\nthe Abbey-room. I spent a delightful evening with the Bishop (Pelham),\r\nwho poured out a rich store of anecdote and recollection for hours. He\r\nspoke much of Manning, whom he had known most intimately--how his\r\ncharacteristic had always been his ambition. He wanted in early life to\r\nhave gone into Parliament; then, when that failed, he wished to have\r\nentered diplomacy; then his father’s bank broke, and he was obliged to\r\ngo into the Church. ‘Your uncle Julius and he,’ said the Bishop, ‘were\r\nonce with my brother (Lord Chichester), and Manning had been holding\r\nforth upon the celibacy of the clergy. “At least you will agree with\r\nme,” he said, turning to my brother, “that celibacy is the holier\r\nstate.” “Then of course you think,” said my brother, “that matrimony is\r\na _less_ holy state than celibacy.” And he started, with a reminiscence\r\nof his own happy married life, and said, “Oh no!”’\r\n\r\n“The Bishop talked much of Jenny Lind’s visit to Norwich when he was\r\nhere with the Stanleys; how the Duke of Cambridge had spoken to her of\r\nthe wonderful enjoyment her noble gift of voice must be, and how she had\r\nanswered, ‘I do enjoy it, and I thank God for giving it to me, and I\r\nfeel that in return I ought to use it first for His glory, and then for\r\nthe raising of my profession.’ When her great concert took place, Mr.\r\nThompson, a Norwich doctor, who had the management of the town\r\ncharities, ventured to put the best of the workhouse school-girls under\r\nthe orchestra, where no one could see them, whilst they could hear\r\neverything. But Jenny was sometimes greatly overcome at the end of one\r\nof her own songs, and it was so then, and when her song was over, she\r\nretired to her own room; but, to reach it, she had to pass under the\r\norchestra, and there she saw a number of girls in tears, and asked who\r\nthey were. Mr. Thompson came to explain with some diffidence, for he did\r\nnot know how she would take it; but she was much interested, and asked,\r\n‘Is there any one of your charities especially to which I could be of\r\nany use?’ And he thought a minute and said, ‘What we really want is a\r\nchildren’s hospital; there has never been one in Norwich.’--‘Then that\r\nis just what I will give a concert for,’ said Jenny Lind; and of course\r\nevery one was delighted, and so the hospital was started. Afterwards she\r\nsent down some one incognito to see how it was managed, and the report\r\nwas so favourable that she said she would give another concert, and that\r\nset it up altogether. It is now the ‘Jenny Lind Hospital.’\r\n\r\n“Talking of the late event at York led to the Bishop’s saying, ‘I heard\r\na fine thing of Archbishop Musgrave. I was not meant to hear it,\r\nthough. I was at Bishopthorpe to preach a consecration sermon for the\r\nBishop of Ripon. It was before I was a bishop myself, and I knew nothing\r\nabout precedence, and did not take my proper place in the procession as\r\nwas intended, though I was all ready, and I let them all pass out before\r\nme. Only the Archbishop and Mrs. Musgrave remained. The Archbishop had\r\nhad a stroke of apoplexy then, from which he was only just recovering,\r\nand it was his first appearance since, and they were all very anxious\r\nabout him. Just as they were leaving the house, the Archbishop said to\r\nhis wife, “My dear, take this key: it will unlock that box, in which you\r\nwill find a commission ready signed and sealed for the three bishops\r\npresent to take my place if anything _happens_ to me during the service:\r\nwhatever happens to me, the service must not be stopped.” And they went\r\non quietly to the church. I did not know which to admire most, the\r\nArchbishop for making the speech, or Mrs. Musgrave’s perfect calmness in\r\nhearing it and in taking the key. I spoke of it to Mrs. Bickersteth (the\r\nBishop of Ripon’s wife) afterwards, and she said, “That explains what\r\nthe Archbishop said to me last night--‘I am afraid you may be anxious\r\nabout the service to-morrow: set yourself quite at rest: everything is\r\nquite settled, so that, whatever happens to me, the ceremony of\r\nto-morrow will be carried out.’”\r\n\r\n“The Lowthers joined me at Norwich, and we went together to\r\nWoodbastwick, and for a delightful visit to the Locker-Lampsons at\r\nCromer. What an enchanting place it is! All the society meets on the\r\nbeach. Two bathing-machines were drawn up side by side, and their\r\ninmates were in the sea. ‘I hope you will kindly consider this as a\r\nvisit,’ said one of them to his neighbour, with his head just above the\r\nwater. ‘Oh, certainly,’ said the neighbour, ‘and I hope you will kindly\r\nconsider this as a visit returned.’\r\n\r\n“Mr. Locker is delightful. He says, ‘I suppose what makes a bore is a\r\nman’s perpetually harping upon one subject, not knowing what details to\r\nleave out, and insisting upon making his voice heard at unsuitable\r\ntimes. But certainly a bore is a bore in accordance with what he is\r\ntalking about: if, for instance, a man went on talking for hours of my\r\n“Lyra Elegantiarum,” I should never think him a bore.’ ‘My dear,’ he\r\nsays to Mrs. Locker-Lampson, ‘are you not sometimes of rather _too_\r\nrigid a disposition? You know, at railway stations you often point out\r\nto me a man as eternally damned because he wears trousers with rather a\r\nbroad check, and has an unusually large cigar in his mouth.’\r\n\r\n“In Lady Buxton’s pretty house are a whole gallery of Richmond\r\nportraits--a stately full-length of (her aunt) Mrs. Fry, most speaking\r\nlikenesses of her benignant father, her beautiful mother, of Sarah and\r\nAnna Gurney, the ‘Cottage Ladies’--of her father-in-law, Sir Fowell of\r\nthe Slave Trade--of her sons and brothers-in-law. Yellow tulips, like\r\nthose at Florence, grow wild in her fields in abundance, and the cows\r\neat them.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To the_ COUNTESS OF DARNLEY.\r\n\r\n“_Hotel d’Italie, Rome, March 30, 1892._--I think you will have wondered\r\nwhat has become of me, and that you will like to know.\r\n\r\n“I have been abroad since November 16, beginning by a week at Paris with\r\nGeorge Jolliffe, who was very ill then, and a month spent at Cannes in\r\nvisits to the De Wesselows, old friends of my Hurstmonceaux childhood;\r\nand to my old schoolfellow Fred Walker and his nice wife, one of the few\r\npeople I know who have seen two separate and undoubted ghosts with their\r\nown eyes. How civilised and be-villa’d Cannes is now, almost the least\r\npretentious house remaining in it being the little Villa Nevada, where\r\nthe Duke of Albany died, which was close to us, and which was so often\r\nvisited by ‘Madame d’Angleterre,’ as the people of Cannes call our\r\nQueen. My ever-kindest of hosts were more people-seeking than\r\nplace-seeing. We had one delightful picnic, however, at the old deserted\r\nvilla of Castellaras, looking upon the blue gorge of the Saut de Loup. A\r\nlittle suspicion of earthquake remained in the air from the alarm of the\r\nlast shock, when my friends’ native housemaid had refused to leave the\r\nwindow, saying, ‘Puisque le dernier jour est arrivé, je veux avoir les\r\nyeux partout, pour voir ce que se passe!’ Here at Rome there was a smart\r\nshock this spring. Our old friend Miss Garden asked _her_ ‘donna’ if she\r\nwas frightened. ‘Oh yes,’ she said; ‘I felt the two walls of my little\r\nroom press in upon my bed. I knew what it was. But I could not remember\r\nwhich was the right saint to pray to in an earthquake. So I just prayed\r\nto my own grandmother, for she was the best person I ever knew, and\r\nimmediately I heard the voice of my grandmother, who said, “Don’t be\r\nfrightened; it will all pass; no harm will come to you.” So then I was\r\nquite calm and satisfied.’ Might not this incident account for many\r\nstories of Catholic saints?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SASSO.]\r\n\r\n“I spent a week at Bordighera. Such varied points for walks! villages\r\nlike Sasso, which are just bright bits of umber colour amongst the\r\ntender grey olives; little painted towns amongst the orange-gardens,\r\nlike Dolceacqua, with its pointed bridge and blue river and great\r\ndeserted palace of the Dorias. George Macdonald, a most grand old\r\npatriarch to look upon, is king of the place. He writes constantly, and\r\nnever leaves the house, except to see a neighbour in need of help or\r\ncomfort. One after another of his delicate daughters has faded away,\r\nbut his sons seem strong and well, and there are several adopted\r\nchildren in the house, half in and half out of the family, but all\r\ncalling Mrs. Macdonald ‘Mama.’ It is a very unusual household, but ruled\r\nin a spirit of love which is most beautiful. I dined with them, the\r\ndining-table placed across one end of the vast common sitting-room. On\r\nSunday evenings he gives a sort of Bible lecture, which all the\r\nsojourners in Bordighera may attend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT BORDIGHERA.][498]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT REBEKAH’S WELL, NEAR S. REMO.]\r\n\r\n“Then I was a month in a palatial hotel at S. Remo, and greatly enjoyed\r\nbright winter days of quiet drawing in its ravines with their\r\nhigh-striding bridges, by its torrents full of Titanic boulders, or on\r\nits pathlets winding through vine and fig gardens or along precipitous\r\ncrags; most of all in a delicious palm-shaded cove by the sea, where I\r\nspent whole days alone with the great chrysoprase waves breaking over\r\nthe rocks in showers of crystal spray. With a charming Mrs. Rycroft and\r\nher pleasant Eton boys, I made longer excursions to Ceriano and\r\nBadalucco, very curious places surrounded by high mountains, with deep\r\ngorges, old bridges, and waterfalls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT S. REMO.]\r\n\r\n“But it is in changed, spoilt Rome that I have spent the last two\r\nmonths. All picturesqueness is now washed out of the place, so that\r\npeople who have any interest about them now usually give it only a\r\nglance and pass on. It has been delightful for me, however, that Miss\r\nHosmer is settled in this hotel, and that we dine together daily at a\r\nlittle round table, where she is a constant coruscation of wit and\r\nwisdom. All day she is shut up in her studio, which is closed to all the\r\nworld, but she cannot have a dull time, by the stories she has to tell\r\nof the workmen and models who are her only companions. Here are a few\r\nof them, only they sound nothing without her twinkling eyes and capital\r\nmanner of telling:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLEN AT S. REMO.]\r\n\r\n“‘Minicuccia was an excellent model, but very jealous. “Have you seen\r\nRosa? What fine arms she has!” I said to her one day. “I have seen\r\n_Rosaccia_” she replied, “and I should have thought, Signorina, that a\r\nlady of your taste would have known better than to admire her arms. What\r\nare they in comparison with really fine arms--with mine, for instance?”\r\n\r\n“‘One day Minicuccia was at a café, and some one admired the legs of\r\nanother model. Forthwith she gathered up her petticoats, and danced with\r\nher legs perfectly bare all about the place. She was not a bad woman; on\r\nthe contrary, she was a very moral one, and there was never a word\r\nagainst her, but she wanted to show what fine legs were. The police,\r\nhowever, heard of that escapade, and she was put in prison for a month\r\nafterwards for such an offence against the _decenza pubblica_. Poor\r\nMinicuccia!\r\n\r\n“‘Then there was Nana, whom Lady Marian (Alford) painted so often, and\r\nwhom she was so fond of. She was a magnificent woman. Dear Lady Marian\r\nused to say, “I would give anything to be able to come into a room with\r\nthe grace and dignity of Nana.” Her dignity was natural to her. Another\r\nmodel once said to me, “I met that Nanaccia; she was walking down the\r\nVia Sistina as if it all belonged to her.”\r\n\r\n“‘There was a very nice boy-model I had, Fortunato he was called. He is\r\ndead now--died of consumption, for he was always delicate. One day he\r\nsaid to me, “Last Sunday, Signorina, I went to the garden of the\r\nCappuccini, and it is _such_ a garden!--quite full of fruit, the most\r\nbeautiful fruit. And the Fathers are so kind; they said I might eat as\r\nmuch as ever I liked; only think of that, Signorina!”--“Well, that was\r\nkind indeed; but what sort of fruit was it?”--“O, cipolle and\r\nlettuge,[499] Signorina--most delicious fruit.”\r\n\r\n“‘Marietta was another model who came to me, a large handsome woman. One\r\nday I said to her, “Now, Marietta, I want you to look sad--_tutta\r\ndolorosa_.”--“What! _lagrime_, Signorina?”--“No,” I said, “only _look_\r\nsad; but if I wanted _lagrime_, could I have them too?”--“Sì, Signora:\r\nbasta pensare a quel calzolajo chi m’a fatto pagare sette lire in vece\r\ndi cinque, et piango subito.”[500]\r\n\r\n“‘Marietta had a brother who managed her little business for her. I\r\nasked her if it would not be very easy for him to misappropriate a\r\n_scudo_ now and then. “Facile sì,” she said, “_essendo fratello_.”\r\n\r\n“‘Mariuccia lived to be old, and many is the dinner and _paolo_ I have\r\ngiven her; but when she was fifteen or so, she was the model for Mr.\r\nGibson’s ‘Psyche borne by the Zephyrs.’ She was always a wonderful\r\nmodel: no one could act or stand as she did.\r\n\r\n“‘Then there was that woman who had the drunken husband, who used to\r\nbeat her. One night he came in late and fell down dead drunk across the\r\nbed. She took her needle and thread, and sewed him up in the sheets so\r\nthat he could not move, and then she took a stick, and beat him so that\r\nhe died of it: she was imprisoned for some years for that, though.\r\n\r\n“‘I asked one of the workmen what he did when every one was away. “Why,\r\nSignorina, I have the studio to clean out.”--“Well, I suppose that takes\r\nyou half-an-hour; and what do you do then?”--“Ma, Signorina, sto a\r\nsedere.”--“And after your dinner, what do you do then?”--“Sto ancora a\r\nsedere, Signorina.”--“Well, and in the evening?”--“Ma, Signorina,\r\ncontinuo di stare a sedere.”\r\n\r\n“‘My man Gigi came to me the other day and said, “I went to the Acqua\r\nAcetosa[501] last Sunday, Signorina, and I liked the water so much, I\r\ndrank no less than twenty _fiaschi_ of it.”--“Well,” I said, “Gigi, that\r\nwas a good deal; I’ll get twenty _fiaschi_ of it, and put twenty _scudi_\r\ndown by them, and then, if you can drink them all off, you shall have\r\nthe _scudi_.”--“Well, Signorina, perhaps I did exaggerate a little: now\r\nI come to think it over, perhaps it was ten _fiaschi_ I drank.”--“Well,\r\ndo it again before me, and you shall have ten _scudi_.” “Now, Signorina,\r\nyou know I like to be precise, perhaps it was six _fiaschi_ I\r\ndrank.”--“Well, do it again and you shall have six _scudi_.”--“Well, I\r\nsuppose it really was two _fiaschi_.”--“Oh, I could drink that myself!”’\r\n\r\n“You may imagine how entertaining stories like these--traits from the\r\nlife around one--make our little dinners, and afterwards we often go\r\ninto the Storys’ apartment close by, where the easy intellectual\r\npleasant talk and fun are always reviving. Besides, it amuses Mrs.\r\nStory, who is most sadly ailing now, though her cheerfulness is an\r\nexample. She says she comforts her sleepless nights by the old distich--\r\n\r\n    ‘For all the ills beneath the sun\r\n     There is a cure, or there is none:\r\n     If there is one, try to find it;\r\n     If there is none, never mind it.’\r\n\r\n“Nothing can describe the charm of Mr. Story’s natural bubble of fun and\r\nwit, or the merry twinkle which often comes into his eye, even now, at\r\nmoments when his wife’s illness does not make him too anxious.[502] He\r\nand Miss Hosmer are capital together. It is difficult to say what are\r\ntheir ‘projecting peculiarities,’ as Dr. Chalmers would have called\r\nthem, they have so many; but they are all of a perfectly delightful\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n“‘Well, what’s the news, Harriet?’ he said as we went in to-night. ‘Why,\r\nthat I am going to be married.’--‘What! to the Pope?’--‘Yes, only I\r\ndidn’t want it to get out till he announced it himself.’\r\n\r\n“‘An American was looking at my statue of Canidia the other day,’ said\r\nMr. Story, and exclaimed--“Ah! Dante, I suppose, or is it--Savonarola?”\r\nAnother man who came to my studio said, “Mr. Story, have you baptized\r\nyour statue?”--“Why, yes,” I said; “generally we think of the name\r\nfirst, and then we set to work in accordance with it.”--“Well,” he said,\r\n“there’s some as doos, and there’s some as doosn’t.”’\r\n\r\n“Mrs Story was very amusing about an Italian who wanted a portrait of\r\nhis father very much, and came to an artist she knew and asked him to\r\npaint it. The artist asked, ‘But when can I see your father?’--‘Oh, you\r\ncan’t see him: he’s dead.’--‘But how can I paint him, then?’--‘Well, I\r\ncan describe him, and he was very like me: I think you can paint him\r\nvery well.’ So the artist painted away, according to the description,\r\nas well as he could. When he had finished the portrait he sent for the\r\nson, anxious to see if he would find any likeness. The son rushed up to\r\nthe picture, knelt down by it, was bathed in tears, and sobbed out, ‘O\r\npadre mio, quanto avete sofferto, o quanto siete cambiato: O non l’aveva\r\nmai riconosciuto.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLAUDIAN AQUEDUCT.][503]\r\n\r\n“Mr. Story says that when _Othello_ was performed at Rome, he saw it\r\nwith an Italian friend, who said afterwards, ‘Convengo che ci sono\r\nqualche belle concette in questa dramma, ma fare tanto disturbo per un\r\nfazzoletto non mi conviene.’\r\n\r\n“Miss Hosmer told of a countryman who was asked what he thought of a\r\ntrain, for he had just seen one for the first time--seen it as it was\r\nentering a tunnel. ‘Well,’ he said, ‘it was just a black monster with a\r\ngoggle eye, and when it saw me, it gave a horrible shriek and ran into\r\nits hole.’\r\n\r\n“I should like you to have heard Miss Hosmer’s recollections of Kestner,\r\nwhose name was so familiar to me in old Bunsen days. He died soon after\r\nshe first came to Rome, but she recollects him as always wearing his old\r\nred studio cap. He knew he was dying, and when it was very near the end,\r\nhe said to those who were with him, ‘Now, my dear friends, it is a very\r\nsad experience to see a person die: I must beg you to leave me: it is my\r\ngreat wish to be alone, and you may come back in two hours.’ They came\r\nback in two hours, and found him lying peacefully dead. That is a\r\nbeautiful story, I think. It was Kestner who, priding himself very much\r\non his good English, said to Lord Houghton, ‘Allow me to present to you\r\nmy knee-pot (_nipote_).’\r\n\r\n“Outside the charmed circle of Palazzo Barberini there is little now at\r\nRome but the most inferior American society. ‘We must stop at Milan, you\r\nknow, going back; there is a picture there by a man called Leonard\r\nVinchey we must be sure to see,’ said a neighbour at the hotel luncheon.\r\nAnd, ‘Mr. Brown, sir, how’s Mrs. Brown’?--‘Well, she’s slim but round’\r\n(meaning weak but about): this is the sort of thing one hears.\r\n\r\n“In this hotel is the intelligent Indian Princess Tanjore, with whom I\r\nhave spent several evenings very pleasantly. Her ‘lady’ is Miss Blyth,\r\nsister of the Bishop of Jerusalem, and authoress of that capital novel\r\n‘Antoinette.’\r\n\r\n“Dear old Miss Garden, whom you will remember hearing of as the kindest\r\nand most original of Scottish ladies, still lives at 64 Via Sistina.\r\n‘How did you manage to boil the eggs so well, Maria, when you can’t\r\ntell the clock?’ said Miss Garden to her old donna, ‘for the eggs are\r\njust perfect.’--‘Why, I’ll tell you how it is,’ said Maria: ‘a lady I\r\nlived with showed me how to do it. I just put them into the water, and\r\nthen I say thirty-three _Credos_, and then I know that they’re done.’\r\n\r\n“With Miss Garden and Mrs. Ramsay I went one day to the curious little\r\nearly christian cemetery of S. Generosa, a lovely spot, where marble\r\nslabs covering the graves of martyrs under Diocletian are still seen in\r\na little hollow surrounded by wild roses and fenochii.\r\n\r\n“My room in this hotel looks out on the Barberini gardens, and the\r\nsplash of its fountain is an enjoyment. Its being lighted by electricity\r\nfor the King’s visit the other day was a type of the times, rather a\r\ncontrast to twenty years ago, when there were torches on every step of\r\nthe great staircase to welcome even a cardinal, and when not only the\r\nstaircase, but the whole street as far as S. Teresa, was hung with\r\ntapestries for the Prince’s funeral.\r\n\r\n“On Ash-Wednesday I went, as I have always done here, to the ‘stations’\r\non the Aventine. It is still a thoroughly Roman scene. Before one\r\nreaches S. Sabina, one is assailed by the chorus of old lady beggars\r\nseated in a double avenue of armchairs leading up to the door, with\r\n‘Datemi qualche cosa, signore, per l’amore della Madonna, datemi\r\nqual’co;’ and behind them kneel the old men--‘Poveri, poveretti cieci,\r\nsignore,’ in brown gowns and with arms stretched out _alla maniera di S.\r\nFrancesco_. Spread with box is the church itself, with its doors wide\r\nopen to the cloistered porch and the sacred orange-tree[504] seen in the\r\nsunny garden beyond. The Abbot is standing there, and has his hand\r\nkissed by all the monks who arrive for the stations, till a cardinal\r\nappears, after which he takes the lower place and is quite deserted.\r\nThen we all hurry on to S. Alessio and its crypt, and then to the\r\nPriorato garden, where, by old custom, we look through the keyhole of\r\nthe door, and see St. Peter’s down a beautiful avenue of bays.\r\n\r\n“The passage of the Pope to the Sistine on his coronation anniversary\r\nwas a very fine sight. Borne along in his golden chair, with the white\r\npeacock fans waving in front of him, and wearing his triple crown, Leo\r\nXIII. looked dying, but gave his benediction with the most serene\r\nmajesty, sinking back between each effort upon his cushions, as if the\r\nend had indeed come. Only his eyes lived, and lived only in his office;\r\notherwise his perfectly spiritualised countenance seemed utterly\r\nunconscious of the thundering _evvivas_ with which he was greeted, and\r\nwhich rose into a perfect roar as he was carried into the Sala Regia.\r\nThe potency of ‘Orders’ here is so great, that my Swedish decoration not\r\nonly gave me the best place, but I took in two young men as my chaplain\r\nand equerry! After the Pope had entered the Sistine, we sat in great\r\ncomfort in the Sala Regia till he returned, and then, as there was no\r\none between us and the procession, we saw all the individual faces of\r\nthe old cardinals--how few of them the same now as those I remember in\r\nthe processions of Pius IX.\r\n\r\n“There are no _evvivas_ now for the comparatively young king with the\r\nwhite hair and the ever-tragic countenance: the taxes are too great. I\r\nbelieve that he can read, if no one else can, the handwriting on the\r\nwall which foretells the doom of his southern kingdom. And yet\r\npersonally no one could be braver or more royal, and, where they detest\r\nthe king, the people honour the man. ‘Your king is at that house which\r\nhas fallen down, helping with his own hands to dig out that old man who\r\nis buried: he won’t leave till the old man is safe,’ said Mrs. Story to\r\nher Italian maid Margherita. ‘Si, Signora, casa di Savoia manca qualche\r\nvolta di testa, mai di cuore;’ and it is quite true. All one hears of\r\nthe King’s self-abnegation is so fine. He used to be quite devoted to\r\nsmoking, but he was ill, and one day his physician told him that it was\r\nextremely deleterious to him. He instantly took his cigar out of his\r\nmouth, threw it into the back of the fire, and has never smoked again.\r\n\r\n“The Pope’s secretary has just died of the influenza. Leo XIII. was much\r\nattached to him, and is greatly distressed by his death. There is\r\nsomething touching in the newspaper account of the Pope’s having refused\r\nto eat, and his attendants having had to use _qualche dolce violenze_ to\r\nmake him do it.\r\n\r\n“We have had two months of rain, only four fine days last week, in which\r\nI went to the Crimera, to Fidenae, to Ostia, and to a touching and\r\nbeautiful Mass in the heart of the Catacomb of S. Praetextatus, where\r\nthe martyrs’ hymn was sung by a full choir upon their graves, its\r\ncadences swelling through the subterranean church and dying away down\r\nthe endless rude passages, so long their refuge, and at last their place\r\nof death.\r\n\r\n“And now I must stop. I am just come up from luncheon. ‘Wal, I guess I’m\r\nstuffed, but I’m not appeased,’ said my neighbour as we came out; and\r\nshe was _con rispetto parlando_, as they say here--a lady.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ HUGH BRYANS.\r\n\r\n“_Rome, April 26, 1892._--How I wish you were here: how you would enjoy\r\nit, though there is little to admire now in this much-changed Rome\r\nbeyond the extreme loveliness of the spring, with its Judas and May\r\nflowers, and the golden broom of the Campagna. I have just been, with my\r\nold friends Mrs. Ramsay and Miss Garden, to the Villa Doria to pick\r\nanemones. There were thousands of them, and the ladies gathered them in\r\nlike a harvest. Their servant was told off to look after the violets.\r\nTheir late man, Francesco, said his was usually a very light place--‘ma\r\nnella primavera, al tempo dei violette, e duro veramente.’\r\n\r\n“I have seen little of the Easter ceremonies. On Holy Thursday I went to\r\nSt. Peter’s, and watched in the immense crowd for the extinction of the\r\nlast candle and beginning of the Miserere; but all the effect was lost\r\nand the music inaudible from the incessant moving and talking.\r\nAfterwards there was a fine scene at the blessing of the altar in the\r\nalready dark church--the procession, with lights, moving up and down\r\nthe altar-steps, and then kneeling all along the central aisle, whilst\r\nthe relics were exhibited from the brilliantly lighted gallery.\r\n\r\n“Fifty-eight artisans and schoolmasters from the Toynbee Hall Institute,\r\nwith some of their wives, have been in Rome for the Easter holidays. On\r\nThursday I took them all over the Palatine, finding them most delightful\r\ncompanions, and the most informed and interested audience I have ever\r\nknown. So since that I have been with them to the Appian Way, and Miss\r\nFleetwood Wilson kindly invited the whole party to tea at the old\r\nPalazzo Mattei, unaltered through three hundred years. I made friends\r\nwith many of the party individually, and think that for really good,\r\nintelligent, high-minded society, one should frequent the East End.\r\n\r\n“What struck me most of all was the absence amongst them of the\r\nscandal-talk which in our own society is so prevalent. ‘Consider how\r\ncheap a kindness it is not to speak ill: it only requires silence,’ is\r\nan exhortation of Bishop Tillotson. They remember this; we don’t.\r\n\r\n“Do you recollect the pretty Miss Cators? With them and some pleasant\r\nAmericans, and Lanciani the famous archaeologist, I have been up Monte\r\nCavi. Lanciani was most delightful, and told us about everything in a\r\nway which had all the enthusiasm and colour without the dry bones of\r\narchaeology, and oh! what lilies, violets, cyclamen, narcissus, covered\r\nthe woods. Another day he lectured on old Fidenae, standing aloft on the\r\nancient citadel, with all his listeners in groups on the turf around\r\nhim, and afterwards they all had luncheon--still in scattered groups: it\r\nwas like the pictures of the miracle of the loaves and fishes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REMAINS OF TEMPLE OF JUPITER LATIARIS, MONTE CAVI.][505]\r\n\r\n“It has been a great pleasure to see a good deal of ‘Mark Twain’ (Mr.\r\nSamuel Clemens) and his most charming wife. He is a wiry, thin old man,\r\nwith abundant grey hair, full round the head, like an Italian _zazzara_.\r\nHe speaks very slowly, dragging his words and sentences laboriously, and\r\nis long in warming up, and when he does, he walks about the room whilst\r\nhe makes all his utterances, which have additional drollery from the\r\nslowness with which they are given. He began life as a wharfinger,\r\nthrowing parcels into barges, and as he threw them the overseer called\r\nout ‘Mark one, Mark twain,’ and the chime of the words struck him, and\r\nhe took the name. Speaking of the Catacombs he said, ‘I might have\r\nhooked the bone of a saint and carried it off in my carpet-sack, but\r\nthen I might get caught with it at the frontier. I should not like to\r\nget caught with a thing like that; I would rather it were something\r\nelse.’ ‘That story by Symonds,’ he said, ‘of a crucifix which contained\r\na dagger, reminds me of the State of Maine. Spirits were strictly\r\nforbidden there, but pocket-testaments became very abundant. They\r\ncontained two or three leaves, then there was a whisky flask. Now with\r\none of those crucifixes and one of these pocket-testaments, one might\r\ncope with the worst society in the world.’\r\n\r\n“‘My man George has made his fortune,’ said Mark Twain. ‘He used to bet\r\non revivals, then he took to betting on horses: he understands it all\r\nround, and he has made a good thing of it.\r\n\r\n“‘One night when I came home unawares, I found the house-door open.\r\nAfter going in and poking round, I rang up George. “Well,” I said,\r\n“George, you’ve been here probably some hours with the house-door\r\nundone.”--“Good heavens!” he cried, striking his forehead, and rushed up\r\nthe stairs five steps at a time. When he came down I said, “Why, George,\r\nwhat was the matter?”--“The matter! why, that the house-door was left\r\nopen, and that there were fifteen hundred dollars between my\r\nmattresses.”’\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Clemens spoke to George one day about his answering ‘Not at home’\r\nwhen she did not want to see visitors. In England it is understood, but\r\nin quiet places in America it is not: it is a lie. And Mrs. Clemens\r\nsaid, ‘George, you really should not say what you know is not true; you\r\nshould say I’m engaged or that I beg to be excused.’ George came close\r\nup to her and said, ‘Mrs. Clemens, if I did not lie, you’d not be able\r\nto keep house a month.’\r\n\r\n“A rival to Mark Twain, or rather one who draws him out capitally, is an\r\nAmerican Miss Page, a very handsome elderly woman like an ancient Juno.\r\nShe said yesterday, ‘I must be going home soon to see all the coloured\r\nfriends and relations. Aunt Maria was groaning very much one day, so I\r\nasked her if she had found religion. She said, “No, but she was on the\r\nanxious bench.” A few days after she had “found religion,” and I asked\r\nher about it. “Why,” she said, “I got religion, and when I found that\r\nI’d got religion, I just did make the chignots (chignons) fly. And so we\r\ndid all; we danced so hard that Uncle Adam had to be sent right away the\r\nnext day to bring them all home in a wheelbarrow.”\r\n\r\n“‘My cousin was begged of by a woman one night,” said Miss Page. ‘She\r\nwas very violent, and she said, “You must give me money, you _shall_, or\r\nI’ll say you’re Jack the Ripper.” He went close up to her, and in\r\nsepulchral accents whispered “I _am_!” and the woman ran off as hard as\r\nshe could.’\r\n\r\n“There are other friends I must tell you about. At No. 38 Gregoriana, in\r\na delightfully home-like apartment with a view of St. Peter’s, live Miss\r\nLeigh Smith and her friend Miss Blyth. The former is a sister of Madame\r\nBodichon, who was such an admirable artist, and is of a most serene,\r\nnoble, and beautiful countenance, but perhaps severe: the latter is\r\ngentleness and sweetness itself, though she is less striking in\r\nappearance. Every one likes them both, but every one loves Miss Blyth.\r\nThey are known as ‘Justitia’ and ‘Misericordia.’\r\n\r\n“Another person of interest, another American, who has come to Rome to\r\nvisit Miss Hosmer, is Mrs. Powers. She is charming. She said this to me\r\nto-day: ‘I took a young lady with me on a Mississippi steamer. She was\r\nvery pretty and attractive. On the deck she sat by an old lady, who\r\nlooked at her and ejaculated “Married?”--“No.” “Engaged?”--“No.” Just\r\nthen her husband came up, and she said to him, “Here’s a young lady who\r\nsays she’s not married and not engaged: how’s that?” He looked her all\r\nover and said, “Guess the pattern don’t take.”’\r\n\r\n“And now, that you may be introduced to all my present society, Miss\r\nHosmer is going to give you one of her dinner enliveners. ‘An American\r\ncame in one day with, “Have you heard this extraordinary news from\r\nEngland?”--“No; what?”--“Why, about the Archbishop of Canterbury.”--“No;\r\nwhat about him?” “Why, about his having refused to bury a waiter at the\r\nLangham Hotel.”--“No; what a proud contemptuous priest he must be; but\r\nwhat possible reason could he give for refusing to bury the\r\nwaiter?”--“Why, that he was not dead.”\r\n\r\n“‘That’s a good catch,’ says Miss Hosmer, who is talking to you; ‘and\r\nnow I’ll give you another. A young man--a very charming young man--was\r\nengaged to be married, and he went down from London for the wedding to\r\nthe place where his bride lived, full of the brightest hopes and\r\nexpectations, and in his pocket he carried the ring with which he was\r\ngoing to marry his love. But alas! when he reached his destination, his\r\nlove had changed her mind, thought better of it, would not marry him at\r\nall. So he came away very miserable, and he thought he would go and hide\r\nhis sorrows in a little fishing-village, where he had often been in\r\nhappier days; he really could not face the world yet. And as soon as he\r\narrived at the village, he went out in a boat, and took the ring from\r\nhis pocket, and threw it far out to sea. Next day a remarkably fine fish\r\nwas brought to table, and when it was opened, what do you think they\r\nfound?--“Why, the ring,” of course you will say, as I did--No, a\r\nfishbone.’ A most provoking story!\r\n\r\n“There are two Misses Feuchtwanger in the hotel, kindest of elderly\r\nAmerican ladies, full of funny reminiscence. ‘Mrs. Broadhurst,’ said one\r\nof them, ‘liked nothing so much as going to dine with her old “Black\r\nMammy;” it was the thing she liked best: and so, through a long course\r\nof years, she heard Black Mammy’s old husband say grace, and the words\r\nhe used were always the same. “Beautiful mansions, we thee redorable,\r\nmany sensations, Amen.” The sound meant a whole world to him.’\r\n\r\n“But I shall send you too much anecdotage, so good-night.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To the_ HON. G. H. JOLLIFFE _and_ JOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Rome, April 27._--All the features of this Roman spring have been\r\nAmerican. Mrs. Lee was in this hotel. ‘I was just raised in the South,’\r\nshe said, ‘and I’m a Southerner to the backbone. Some one wanted to be\r\ncomplimentary, and wrote of me in a newspaper as one raised in the lap\r\nof luxury, but I was just raised in the lap of an old nigger.’ She was\r\nvery full of having been to the masquerade ball at La Scala. ‘It was\r\nawfully indecent. I could not have let my daughter go, but for me it did\r\nnot matter; so I just went, and stayed to the end, for I thought some\r\none might come along and say, “Ah! you don’t know about that, because it\r\nhappened after you left,” so I thought I’d just see what was indecent\r\nfor once; it might be my only chance; and I made quite sure nothing\r\nshould happen after I left.’\r\n\r\n“‘Don’t you know,’ she says, ‘that we call a story we have heard before\r\n“a chestnut”? Why, in America the smart young men used to wear a little\r\nbell on their watch-chains, and if they heard a story too often, they\r\nrung it to show the story was stale. That was the chestnut-bell.’\r\n\r\n“Perhaps the most interesting American here is the Bishop of Nova\r\nScotia. ‘“I’ve captured a church,” said a young American parson to me.\r\n“Captured a church! what in the world do you mean?”--“Why, I went into a\r\nchurch where the boys (soldiers) go, and I was asked to take the\r\nservice. Soon the boys came in, and I saw that there was going to be a\r\nrow. A lot of them sat down by the door, and as soon as I began to\r\npreach, one of them crowed like a cock. I said, ‘Just crow again, will\r\nyou; I’m not ready for you yet.’ So he crowed again. Then I said, ‘Now,\r\nif you crow again, I’ll just fix up your beak to the anvil of God’s\r\nrighteousness, and I’ll beat out your brains with the sledge-hammer of\r\nthe wrath of God. Now, crow again, if you dare,’ and he did not crow any\r\nmore, so I captured the church.”\r\n\r\n“‘I would not give five cents to hear what Bob Ingleson considers to be\r\nthe faults of Moses, but I’d give every cent I possess to know what\r\nMoses thinks of the faults of Bob Ingleson.\r\n\r\n“‘I asked somebody if he thought my sermon was too low or too high, and\r\nhe said “Neither, but I thought it was too long.”’\r\n\r\n“I always dine at a little table with Miss Hosmer, where I am sure her\r\nfun and wit are more nourishing than all the rest of the viands put\r\ntogether. She says, ‘Our real name is Osmer, but our country people\r\ncould never manage a name like that, so we voluntarily added the H.\r\nGenerally, provided we are born somehow, we never care who our fathers\r\nand mothers were; but I did, and I had an uncle who found out that we\r\nwere descended from a robber chieftain on the Rhine. Afterwards, in\r\nTurner’s “History of the Anglo-Saxons,” I found that the robber chief\r\nOsmer was one of the sons of Ida, king of Northumberland, and Ida\r\nclaimed descent from Odin, so it is from Odin that I descend.’\r\n\r\n“‘I promised to tell you about the siege of Rome,’ said Miss Hosmer the\r\nother day. ‘All that year we knew it was coming, and at last it came.\r\nThe Italians had 70,000 men, and the Pope had only 11,000, so of course\r\nall effectual resistance was out of the question; but it was necessary\r\nto make a semblance of defence, to show that the Romans only gave in to\r\nforce. September came, and the _forestieri_ who remained in Rome were\r\nall urged to leave, but Miss Brewster and I elected to stay. We were not\r\nlikely to have another chance of seeing a bombardment, so we just hung\r\nan American flag out of our windows; that we were told we must do, as it\r\nmight be necessary to protect us from pillage. All the other\r\n_forestieri_ left, and most of the Roman aristocracy. In the last days,\r\nwhen the Sardinians were just going to enter, there was a solemn Mass in\r\nSt. Peter’s for the Pope, to implore protection for him against his\r\nenemies. I went with Miss Brewster. It was the most striking sight I\r\never saw. Every corner of the vast church was filled. Every one was in\r\nblack--every one except the Pope in his white robes, and when he\r\nappeared, a universal wail echoed through the church. It was not a\r\nsilent cry; it was the wail of thousands. There was not a dry eye in the\r\nchurch. The Pope passed close to me. His face was as white as his dress,\r\nand down his face the large tears kept rolling, and all his clergy, in\r\nblack, were crying too. Oh, it was a terrible sight. I am not a\r\nCatholic, I am much the contrary, but I sobbed; every one did. Well, the\r\nPope passed into the chapel where he was to say Mass, and he said it,\r\nand he walked back again; but he was still crying. It was very piteous,\r\nand when we went out into the piazza, there was Monte Mario white with\r\nthe tents of the Italians, waiting, like vultures, to descend. It was\r\nuncertain, for the last few days, by which gate they would enter. It\r\nwas thought it would be by the Porta Angelica, then by the Porta del\r\nPopolo; finally, it was by the Porta Pia.\r\n\r\n“‘We were told that there would be no bombardment, but at five in the\r\nmorning we were waked by the cannon, and they went on till ten. Shells\r\ncame flying over our house, and one of them struck the church near us,\r\nand carried part of it away. At ten there seemed to be a cessation, so I\r\nsallied out as far as the Quattro Fontane, with my man Pietro behind me.\r\nWhen I got into the Via Pia (now Venti Settembre), I heard a cry of “In\r\ndietro! in dietro!” and the people ran. I thought I might as well get\r\nout of the way too, but indeed, any way, I was carried back by the\r\ncrowd. I heard what I thought was a scampering of feet behind me, and\r\nwhen I reached the Quattro Fontane, I looked back, and seeing a man I\r\nknew, I said, “Why, what is the matter with you?” for he was covered\r\nwith blood, and he said, “Why, Signorina, did not you know that a shell\r\nburst close behind you, and it has carried off several of my fingers,\r\nSignorina?” So I just took him into my house and gave him some wine, and\r\nbound his hand up as well as I could, and then sent him on to a surgeon.\r\nThen I went up to Rossetti’s house beyond the Cappuccini, because I\r\nthought from his loggia I should be able to see all that was to be seen;\r\nbut as soon as we reached the roof a musket-ball grazed my face, and\r\nothers were playing round us, so I said, “We had better get out of\r\nthis,” and we went down.\r\n\r\n“‘After the firing finally stopped, we went to Porta Pia to see the\r\ndamage. The house which is now the British Embassy was completely\r\nriddled. Six dead Zouaves were lying in the Villa Napoleone opposite,\r\nand though the statues of S. Peter and S. Paul, which you will remember\r\nat the gate, were otherwise intact, both their heads were lying at their\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n“‘At four, we went out again to see the Italian troops march into the\r\ncity. There was no enthusiasm whatever. The troops divided, some going\r\nby S. Niccola, others by the Quattro Fontane, to their different\r\nbarracks.’\r\n\r\n“No one who did not know the ‘has been’ can believe how the sights of\r\nthe Rome of our former days have dwindled away. All is now vulgarity and\r\ntinsel: the calm majesty of the Rome of our former winters is gone for\r\never.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS LEYCESTER.\r\n\r\n“_Cadenabbia, May 13._--At Florence, I went with the Duchess of\r\nSermoneta and Lady Shrewsbury to spend an evening with the grand old\r\nfamily of Torrigiani, in the palace where the four sons, their wives,\r\nand children innumerable, live with their charming mother, the Marchesa\r\nElisabetta, in perfect harmony and love; and another day went out to\r\nPoggio Gherardo, a grand fortified villa, approached through half-a-mile\r\nof roses, where the Ross’s now live. Then I was half a day at Padua,\r\nvisiting it as a tourist after many years, with my own book as a guide,\r\nand a most delightful book I thought it!\r\n\r\n“At Venice, I went to see ‘Pen Browning’ at the Palazzo Rezzonico, his\r\nmost beautiful old palace, full of memorials of Pope Clement XIII. The\r\nson Browning has no likeness to either father or mother: he has worked\r\nhard, both as painter and sculptor, and has a good portrait as well as a\r\nbust of his father, from his own hands. There were many relics of his\r\nparents and their friends, amongst them a sketch by Rossetti of Tennyson\r\nreading one of his own poems to them, with an inscription by Mrs.\r\nBrowning. ‘Pen’ was going off to his house at Asolo, a place which his\r\nfather first brought into notice when he walked there and wrote ‘Pippa\r\nPasses.’\r\n\r\n“Calling on a Mrs. Bronson in a neighbouring house, I met a young lady\r\nwith fluffy hair, a Countess Mocenigo. ‘My dear, how many Doges had you\r\nin your family?’ said Mrs. B. ‘Seven,’ she answered, and there really\r\nwere seven Doges of the name Mocenigo, besides all those from whom she\r\nwas descended by the different marriages of her ancestors.\r\n\r\n“Venice is still as full of odd stories as when my sister went to a\r\nparty there, and was surprised because the oddly dressed old lady by her\r\nside never answered when she spoke, and then found she was made of wax.\r\nMost of the company were, being ancestors present thus in the family\r\nlife of the present. Recently a lady named Berthold has lived at Venice\r\nwho was of marvellous beauty and charm. All the society flocked to her\r\nparties. One evening she invited all her friends as usual. They found\r\nthe palace splendidly lighted, and listened to the most exquisite music.\r\nAt the close of the evening, curtains which concealed a platform at the\r\nend of the principal room were drawn aside, and within, the beautiful\r\nhostess was seen, seated on a throne, and sparkling with jewels, in all\r\nher resplendent loveliness. And then, as she waved a farewell to all\r\npresent, the curtains were suddenly drawn, and she disappeared for ever.\r\nNo human eye has seen her since. She had observed signs, unperceived by\r\nothers, that her beauty was beginning to wane!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VENETIAN POZZO.][506]\r\n\r\n“In the hotel was a charming old lady who had just come back from Japan,\r\nand who was arrayed in a thick quilted and embroidered dress, presented\r\nto her by a Japanese lady. Her name, American fashion, was Mrs. Mary\r\nRidge Perkins. Her husband had sent her abroad, as she said, ‘with a\r\nbig letter of credit.’ ‘Mary, you may just go and do the honours of the\r\nold country alone.’ She hates English aristocrats, but was ameliorated\r\ntowards Lord Digby, with whom she travelled back from Japan. He pressed\r\nher to come and see him in London--‘Not if you have your paint on.’ She\r\nhas no children of her own, but, in the war, she and her husband adopted\r\nno less than thirty, who were rendered homeless. They all call her\r\n‘Auntie Perkins,’ but their children call her grandmother. All the\r\nthirty are married now, and Mrs. Perkins never intends to leave her own\r\nhome again, except to visit them. She came down to the gondola to see me\r\noff to the station with no bonnet on her aureole of short white curls,\r\nand I was touched by her parting benediction: ‘May your life always be\r\nhappy, for you have always made others happy.’\r\n\r\n“Here, at pleasant Cadenabbia, I have been glad to fall in with Lord and\r\nLady Ripon. He said, ‘Do you know that _you_ have been the cause of my\r\nbuying a property in Italy?’ It was in consequence of the sentence in my\r\n‘Cities of Central Italy’ beseeching some Roman Catholic nobleman to\r\nsave such a sacred and historic place, that he had bought S. Chiara’s\r\nconvent of S. Damiano near Assisi, giving its use to the monks on the\r\nsole condition that it was never to be ‘restored.’\r\n\r\n“An odd thing has happened to me here, almost like a slight shadow on\r\nthe path. I met ---- who lives here, and whom I used to know very well,\r\nand went up to meet him with pleasure, and he cut me dead! I have not an\r\nidea why, and he will give no explanation. ‘Il faut apprendre de la vie\r\nà souffrir la vie.’\r\n\r\n“The Archbishop of York and Augusta are at Cadenabbia, and have taken me\r\nacross the lake in their little boat to tea with Charlie Dalison on that\r\nlovely terrace of Villa Serbelloni.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\nA KNOCKING AT THE DOOR\r\n\r\n     “Let us try to see, try to do, better always and better. No\r\n     honourable, truly good and noble thing we do or have done for one\r\n     another, but will bear its good fruit. That is as true as truth\r\n     itself, a faith that should never fail us.”--CARLYLE’S _Letters_.\r\n\r\n     “What I must do is all that concerns me, and not what the people\r\n     think. This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual\r\n     life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and\r\n     meanness.\r\n\r\n     “It is the harder because you will always find those who think they\r\n     know what your duty is better than you know it. It is easy in the\r\n     world to live after the world’s opinion: it is easy in solitude to\r\n     live after your own; but the great man is he who, in the midst of\r\n     the crowd, keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of\r\n     solitude.”--EMERSON.\r\n\r\n    “On parent knees, a naked new-born child,\r\n     Weeping thou sat’st, while all around thee smiled:\r\n     So live, that, sinking in thy last long sleep,\r\n     Calm thou may’st smile while all around thee weep.”\r\n         --SIR W. JONES, _from the Persian_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1892 was full of quiet pleasures. Visits to Cobham,\r\nChevening, and to Mrs. Rycroft at Everlands, leave little to be\r\nremembered except the pleasant parties and the extreme kindness of hosts\r\nand hostesses everywhere. I am indeed glad that my visiting-lines are\r\ncast in such pleasant places, that I so seldom have to consort with the\r\ndrearier part of human nature--the “Hem-haw, really, you don’t say so”\r\nsort of people. In these houses, where the conversation is perfectly\r\ncharming, yet where no evil is spoken of any one or by any one, one sees\r\ntruly how a christian spirit will christianise everything it touches,\r\nand one learns--as, indeed, when does one not learn?--that the best\r\nshield against slander is to live so that nobody may believe it.\r\n\r\nIn September I was at gloriously picturesque Montacute in Somersetshire,\r\na noble house of yellow grey stone, where all the surroundings,\r\nterraces, vases, flowers, chime into the most harmonious whole. With its\r\ncharming owner, Mrs. Phelips, I made an excursion to Ford, a grand old\r\nabbey altered into a luxurious dwelling-house by Inigo Jones, and where\r\nTime has blended the new work with the old, till they are equally\r\npicturesque. The great hall has its gothic roof of abbatial times, and\r\nin the stately saloon are noble Mortlake tapestries, said to have been\r\npresented by Charles I. to his Chancellor, but more probably the gift of\r\nAnne. Then I was with Lord Zouche, a pleasant friend of late times, at\r\nhis fine old haunted house and ferny deer-park at Parham, meeting, with\r\nothers, Lord Robert Bruce, called “the King of Hayling Island,” where he\r\nlives and brims over with fun and anecdote. I saw from Parham the new\r\ncastle at Arundel, magnificently uncomfortable and containing little of\r\ninterest. But there was something touching in looking into the open\r\ngrave in which Cardinal Howard was to be laid in a few days, and\r\nremembering the different phases in which I had known him well--as the\r\nsmartest of young Guardsmen, as a priest, where he seemed so unnatural,\r\nand finally as Cardinal. The recollection came back of how, when the\r\nother cardinals were shuffling along St. Peter’s, Cardinal Howard\r\nmarched along in stately complacency, holding back his train on one side\r\nas a lady does her dress. “E troppo soldato,” said the other cardinals.\r\n\r\nAt Petworth I saw the magnificent Vandykes, Turners, and Reynoldses in\r\nthe waste of its dreary saloons. Then with Mary Hare I went to\r\nWoolbeding, a drive through loveliest lanes, across an open common\r\ncovered with fern turned brown by the early frost, and then down an\r\navenue of magnificent Scotch firs, to where lines of gorgeous flowers\r\nled up to the house, like a French château with high roof and dormer\r\nwindows. I had always wished to see its charming owner, Lady Lanerton,\r\nwho was just what I expected--a beautiful old lady, quite unable from\r\nrheumatism to move out of the chair in which, put upon wheels, she can\r\nbe taken to the services in the little church in the garden, filled with\r\nmemorials of those she has loved and outlived. In her face was the\r\nsatisfied and restful expression of one waiting in grateful patience and\r\nhumblest hope upon the borderland. She seemed to say, what I have just\r\nread as amongst Mrs. Stowe’s last words, “I feel about all things now as\r\nI do about the things that happen in a hotel after my trunk is packed to\r\ngo home. I may be vexed and annoyed--but what of it? I am going home\r\nsoon.” In the garden, amongst the splendid profusion of old-fashioned\r\nflowers, I was glad to find Lady Bagot, linked with many memories of my\r\nlong ago.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To the_ HON. G. H. JOLLIFFE.\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 1._--I have had an interesting and most pleasant visit to Sir\r\nJohn Lubbock, one of the most delightful of men, so entirely captivating\r\nin his simplicity of true wisdom, that no one could fail to be fond of\r\nhim. His home of High Elms, near Orpington, is a beautiful place, quite\r\nnear London, but with glorious woods and an entirely country aspect.\r\nProfessor Forster and many other clever men were there, all far too\r\nlearned for me, but I did not even try to ‘live up to them,’ and so\r\nenjoyed myself thoroughly. I went on from High Elms to Sir George\r\nHigginson’s at Great Marlow, and he--a very dear old friend--with all\r\nthe manly straightforwardness of a splendid soldier and the chivalry of\r\nthe most refined gentleness, is almost as attractive as Sir John, doing\r\nfar more than many cleverer people to make life pleasant, and verifying\r\nMadame Swetchine’s words, ‘C’est par l’esprit qu’on s’amuse, c’est par\r\nle cœur qu’on ne s’ennuie pas.’ Thence, I was taken to see my\r\nDashwood cousins at West Wycombe House, which is full of curious\r\npictures and furniture, recalling a French château of the beginning of\r\nthe eighteenth century, even in the peculiarly refined and delicate\r\nloveliness of its chatelaine.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ VISCOUNT HALIFAX.\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 9._--I have been very ill. It was a bad chill at first, followed\r\nby most terrible pains, which I thought were part of the chill, and\r\nstruggled against, moving about when I ought to have kept perfectly\r\nstill. When at last I sent for a doctor, he said I had been in most\r\nimminent danger for several days, and that I must have died before\r\nanother forty-eight hours were over if he had not come just then. A\r\nslight operation was necessary at once to re-arrange an internal\r\nmisplacement, and this relieved the agonising pain. I have not often\r\nbeen before so immediately, never so suddenly, face to face with\r\npossible death. For some hours no one knew how it would go, yet I have\r\noften _felt_ more ill. There was constantly in my mind a text which I\r\nbelieve is in the Old Testament somewhere, ‘Shall not the Judge of all\r\nthe earth do right?’ and I rested upon it somehow. There seems something\r\nalmost cowardly in the way in which, when very ill, one turns for\r\ncomfort to texts and hymns and prayers, which one seldom thinks of at\r\nother times. But I _do_ find them a comfort, and I suppose it is partly\r\nthe natural transition from active to contemplative life.... Still I\r\ncannot say what my extreme thankfulness was when it was pronounced that\r\nall was going on well and that I was likely to recover. I suspect that I\r\nshall have to ‘go softly’ for a long time to come, perhaps always, and\r\nnever be quite as well as I have been: still, in the many mercies which\r\nare left to me, I shall never have time to think of the disagreeables.\r\n\r\n“How strange it is when one knows, when one is told, that one is almost\r\nin the valley of the shadow of death! I felt more surprised than\r\nfrightened; indeed, I do not think I felt frightened at all, I could\r\nleave it so completely in wiser Hands. But I know that I looked very\r\nwistfully at all the little familiar pictures on the wall, feeling how\r\nsorry I should be to see them for the last time, and to part from all\r\n‘the boys’ and my many interests here, and go into the unknown, of which\r\none knows so little; only that I do, absolutely and entirely, trust in\r\nthe mercy of God, and know that it will be well somehow; as to the how,\r\nGod will know best how to settle it.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it may be, as in Michelangelo’s sonnet--\r\n\r\n    ‘Not death indeed, but the dread thought of death saveth and severeth.’\r\n\r\n“I may not always go on feeling so; but I feel now as if I had left my\r\nlong youth on the other side of this illness. Andersen says, ‘The stem\r\nof the pine-tree forms knots which betray the age of the tree: human\r\nlife has also its perceptible rings;’ I suspect this illness will be a\r\nperceptible ring to me.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To the_ HON. G. H. JOLLIFFE.\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 21, 1892._--You know how ill I was in November, but you do not\r\nknow all the serious thoughts it awakened. ‘Il est ennuyeux de vivre\r\ndans la grâce de Dieu, mais tout le monde veut y mourir;’ is that what\r\nyou would answer? I have a great deal to say about it, but as you will\r\nlike facts better, I will only tell you that since I recovered I have\r\nbeen quite a tour of visits, beginning with Lady Beauchamp,[507] and\r\nmeeting charming Lady Granville and a party of sixteen young men and\r\nmaidens at Madresfield Court, a moated house with a lovely view of the\r\nMalvern Hills, and full of precious collections of every kind--old\r\nbooks, old music, old miniatures, ivories, enamels, &c. In my room, ‘the\r\nStuart Room,’ it was a pleasure to live with portraits inscribed ‘Mary\r\nStewart, Princess of Orange,’ and ‘King James III.’ There is a chapel,\r\nwhere Lady Mary Lygon watches over the musical part of the services,\r\naided by a footman who sings splendidly and plays five instruments well!\r\n\r\n“I was several days at Moor Park near Ludlow, the stately house of Mrs.\r\nJohnston Foster and her pleasant heiress-daughters. They have built a\r\nhuge and handsome church near their present home, and another in\r\nYorkshire. Mrs. Foster took me to spend the day at the curious old house\r\nof Kyre, where there is a hiding-place in the hall behind a picture on a\r\nsliding panel, and an oubliette in the floor beneath a trap-door.\r\nAmongst the pictures was a curious portrait of Lady Pytts, whose\r\ndaughter married Sir Thomas Stanley, the first baronet of Alderley, and\r\nplanted the Alderley wood with beech-nuts from her old home, for before\r\nthat ‘there were no beech-trees in Cheshire.’ The lady of the house,\r\nMrs. Childe, has a wonderful power of making slight sketches from all\r\nsuch old portraits in the houses where she visits, and has many volumes\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n“At Hereford I spent a most pleasant day with kindly Dean Herbert, who\r\nshowed me all the details of his cathedral, which is beautiful still,\r\nthough somewhat spoilt by Wyatt. Nothing was more interesting than the\r\nslab tombs of a bishop and dean, who were such friends, that their hands\r\nare represented as clasping each other from their adjoining gravestones.\r\nHow seldom this can have been possible!\r\n\r\n“I was one day with my Biddulph cousins at Ledbury, and was even more\r\nstruck than before with their delightful old house of 1590, ‘entre cour\r\net jardin,’ like the houses of the Faubourg S. Germain, entered by a\r\ncourt from the little town, and with a delicious garden and an old\r\ndeer-park--perhaps the smallest in England--on the other side. I was at\r\nShakspeare’s Charlecote afterwards, and at Warwick, and oh! so bitterly\r\ncold!\r\n\r\n“It has been almost constantly bad weather, but I do not mind that as I\r\nused. I think it was Caroline Fox who first reminded us of ‘A wet day\r\nand all its luxuries, a fine day and all its liabilities.’\r\n\r\n“Then I had a happy week at beautiful old Blickling, with Constance,\r\nLady Lothian, who--though no blood relation to her--reminded me more\r\nthan any one else of my dear Lady Waterford, with much the same charm of\r\nmanner and power of enjoyment of all the smallest things of beauty. The\r\npark, gloriously wild, belonged to Harold, and endless illustrious\r\nowners since. The house is a dream of beauty externally, and is full of\r\nghost-stories. It was the family home of the Boleyns, and in the\r\ntapestried drawing-room Anne Boleyn is still supposed to walk at night\r\nwith her head in her hand. In the present serving-room the devil\r\nappeared to Lord Rockingham, who threw an inkstand at him, which missed,\r\nand marked the wall. When Lord and Lady Lothian first came to Blickling,\r\nthey altered the house and pulled down partitions to make the present\r\nmorning-room. ‘I wish these young people would not pull down the\r\npartitions,’ said an old woman in the village to the clergyman. ‘Why\r\nso?’--‘Oh, because of the dog. Don’t you know that when A. was fishing\r\nin the lake, he caught an enormous fish, and that, when it was landed, a\r\ngreat black dog came out of its mouth? They never could get rid of that\r\ndog, who kept going round and round in circles inside the house, till\r\nthey sent for a wise man from London, who opposed the straight lines of\r\nthe partitions to the lines of the circles, and so quieted the dog. But\r\nif these young people pull down the partitions, they will let the dog\r\nloose again, and there’s not a wise man in all London could lay that dog\r\nnow.’\r\n\r\n“Lady Lothian took me to Mannington, Lord Orford’s[508] curious little\r\nplace. The garden, with its clipped hedges, statues, and vases, is\r\nsurrounded, with the house, by a wide moat. The house is full of old\r\npictures and furniture. In the dining-room is a sculptured skeleton\r\nwhispering to a monk. It was here that Dr. Jephson saw his\r\nmuch-talked-of ghost. He had been sitting up late over the MSS., when an\r\nold man appeared to him. He spoke to the figure, and, though it did not\r\nanswer, he was for some time quite certain of the apparition. Whilst I\r\nwas at Blickling, however, Dr. Jephson was one of my fellow-guests, and\r\nhe now thinks the vision was an optical delusion.\r\n\r\n“On the outer wall of the house of Mannington are a number of Latin\r\ninscriptions, put up by the present owner. They are all most bitter,\r\nvehement, and incisive against women. But in a distant part of the\r\ngrounds there is also a monument to ‘Louise,’[509] with ‘Pensez à lui,\r\net priez pour elle.’ This is in a little wood, close to an old ruined\r\nchapel, within which Lord Orford has already placed his own sarcophagus,\r\nwith an inscription (saying nobody else would ever do it), and around\r\nwhich he has collected a vast number of architectural fragments from\r\ndestroyed churches. Lord Orford seldom comes to Mannington now, but\r\ntill five years ago he was much here in strictest seclusion, with his\r\nadopted son and his wife, who were much tried by the dinner at half-past\r\nsix, always of exactly the same food, after which he would talk to the\r\nlady with incessant quotations from the Latin poets, of which she did\r\nnot understand a word. Every Saturday he used to pass Blickling on his\r\nway to Norwich, where he used to see his doctor, play a game of whist,\r\nand hear a mass, returning next day.\r\n\r\n“I was two days at Titsey with Granville Leveson Gower, who is a\r\ndelightful archaeologist. I remember him at Oxford. Now he has six sons\r\nof his own, several of them very handsome.\r\n\r\n“And all this time dear Lady Egerton’s death has been a shadow. She was\r\na most kind friend to me, and ‘La Mort laisse souvent plus de vide que\r\nla Vie ne prenait de place.’ It was characteristic of her great\r\nunselfishness that, when she knew her illness must be a very suffering\r\none and certainly fatal, she insisted upon being removed from the home\r\nshe loved so devotedly to a hired house at Eastbourne, in order that\r\nTatton might not be left with any distressing association for her\r\nhusband. Truly of her may be said--\r\n\r\n    ‘But by her grave is peace and perfect beauty,\r\n          With the sweet heaven above,\r\n     Fit emblems of a life of Work and Duty\r\n          Transfigured into Love.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ W.

MILLIGAN _and_ JOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Belvoir Castle, Jan. 6, 1893._--‘Be firm with the weather, and it’s\r\nsure to clear up,’ said old Miss Hammersley, and, after the terrible\r\nearly winter, the weather, though bitterly cold, is most glorious. My\r\narrival at this stately castle was a fiasco. The Duchess had forgotten\r\nthat she had told me to come to their little station of Redmile, and\r\nwhen I arrived at that desolate place, with deep snow on the ground and\r\nnight fast closing in, there was nothing to meet me. The stationmaster\r\nsent his little boy to the next village, and in an hour he returned with\r\nan open waggonette, agonisingly cold across the open plain. But I was\r\nrepaid when we entered the still loveliness of the ice-laden woods,\r\nevery bough sparkling in the moonlight like crystallised silver; and\r\nstill more when we emerged upon the plateau at the top of the hill, and\r\nthe mighty towers of the castle rose pale grey into the clear air,\r\nlooking down into the wooded frost-bound gorges like the palace of the\r\nice-queen. I found the Duchess waiting for me in the corridor, with that\r\ngenial solicitude for one’s comfort which goes straight to the heart\r\nwhen one does meet with it, which is so seldom.\r\n\r\n“It was a great pleasure to find the all-delightful Speaker here, with\r\nhis pleasant daughters, also my friend Wilfrid Ricardo. The rest of the\r\nparty are Lady Bristol and her daughter, Lady Clancarty and hers,\r\npleasant Fred Henniker and his sister, Mr. Macalmont, Mr. G. H. Smith,\r\nMiss De la Brosse, &c., besides the sons and daughters of the house.\r\n\r\n“How I like all the mediaeval ways--the trumpeters, who walk up and down\r\nthe passages and sound the dressing-time: the watchman, who calls the\r\nhours through the night; the ball-room, always ready in the evenings for\r\nthose who want to dance: the band, in uniform, which plays soft music\r\nfrom an adjoining room during dinner, at which all the hunting men\r\nappear in their red coats, and add brilliancy and colour to the\r\nimmensely long table with its glorious old silver ornaments.\r\n\r\n“On the first morning, the Speaker and I went after breakfast with the\r\nDuchess to her private rooms, filled with comfort and sunshine, where\r\nshe fed thousands of birds upon the little platform outside her windows,\r\nand the Duke, amongst other treasures, showed me a deed of King John\r\nconferring Haddon upon Richard Manners.\r\n\r\n“At 12, I met the Duke and Duchess again, and walked alone with them on\r\nthe terraces and along the exquisitely beautiful wood walks, all\r\nglistening in silvered splendour, whilst the sun was bright and the air\r\nquite still. The Duke told me how he had the bill--at £60 a piece--of\r\nthose curious statues by Cibber which are such an ornament to the\r\ngarden. Nothing could be more delightful than the way in which he talked\r\nabout the place, and with great affection of his brother the late Duke.\r\nWhen we reached a little garden where there is a slab inscribed with\r\nverses by Mrs. Kemble, he was tired and returned. I went on with the\r\nDuchess, a long and most attractive path through the woods, and she\r\ntalked of her real devotion to the Queen, and of the Queen’s extreme\r\nkindness to her, especially in insisting on the Duke’s going to\r\nWiesbaden to the doctor who cured his eyes when he seemed upon the verge\r\nof total blindness. After luncheon, the Duke took the Speaker and me to\r\nsee in detail the miniatures, which are so beautifully arranged in\r\nlittle panels on the drawing-room walls, with movable glasses in front.\r\nWonderful are those portraits of Sir Philip Sidney, of his friend Prince\r\nHenry (with pearl earrings), and of Charles I. as a boy, with an\r\ninscription speaking of him as ‘the Hope of England.’ Then we saw those\r\ntwo little tables; one a sort of shrine to the Duke of Wellington, with\r\nthe (framed) letter which he wrote to the then Duchess after her son\r\nLord Robert was wounded in Spain--the prettiest, kindest letter ever\r\nwritten: the other a shrine to the Duke of York, with his little bust,\r\npart of his famous Protestant speech on yellow satin, and part of the\r\nfamous Cheshire cheese presented to him after it, and a bit of which he\r\nsent, with a letter, to the Duchess of Rutland.\r\n\r\n“In an exquisite old case worked by the Duke’s great-grandmother, and\r\nbeneath a heart of pearls enclosing his hair, is the last letter of her\r\nson, Lord Robert Manners, who fell as captain of the _Resolution_ in\r\naction under Rodney. The letter is addressed to the captain of another\r\nship, asking him to come to see him, and is written in the utmost\r\ncheerfulness--‘though one leg is off, the other shattered, and one arm\r\nbroke.’ He died immediately afterwards of lockjaw. The beautiful\r\nportrait of this very handsome young hero hangs in the ball-room.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday the Duchess was ill, and I went out alone with the Duke to\r\nthe kitchen-garden and to the fine stables, of Charles II.’s time, where\r\nthere are still sixty horses, over which Edward Manners presides as\r\n‘field-master.’ The Government gives £5 annually as a retaining fee for\r\nten of the best horses being always entered to serve in case of an\r\ninvasion. I cannot say how delightful I think the Duke, what a noble old\r\nman in every truest sense.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 1893._--Mrs. Kemble was certainly the living person I most wished\r\nto see, but I have let too many opportunities slip, and she has passed\r\naway without my knowing her. She must have been a great and generous\r\nwoman, and those who knew her always loved though they feared her. Miss\r\nHosmer has often told me how dearly she and her companions loved Mrs.\r\nKemble when she was at school in America near the place where she lived.\r\nShe would come voluntarily and read to the school-girls half a play in\r\nthe morning and would finish it in the evening. Once, when she was\r\nreading, snow came on, and when she was to go home it was quite deep; so\r\nall the school-girls turned out with spades and brooms and cleared it\r\naway before her.\r\n\r\n“But her severe manner terrified those who were given that way. ‘We had\r\nsome private theatricals,’ Mrs. Story told me, ‘and Mrs. Kemble came to\r\nlook on at the rehearsal, at which a girl was acting who was supposed to\r\ndo it very well. Afterwards, when she came in, Mrs. Kemble walked up to\r\nher, and ‘_Are_ you a fool?’ was all she said.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Silas Bartol, the Unitarian minister at Boston, took his girl to\r\nsee Mrs. Kemble. He was nervous, and said, ‘My daughter wished so much\r\nto have the honour of knowing--rather of hearing--rather of seeing Mrs.\r\nKemble, that I have ventured to bring her.’ Mrs. Kemble bowed stiffly,\r\nand motioned them to sit down, but she said nothing. The girl only sat\r\nand stared at her. Then the father[510] tried again--‘My daughter is\r\nvery young--is very nervous--is very shy.’ Then Mrs. Kemble looked at\r\nthem both, and, in her most sepulchral accents, said, ‘Shy! I also am\r\nshy. And since your daughter has nothing to say to me, and since most\r\nassuredly I have nothing to say to her, I will wish you good morning.’\r\n\r\n“To some Americans she met she said, ‘We hate you for your politics: we\r\nhate you for your prosperity: we hate you for your manners: and ... I\r\ndon’t wonder at it.’\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Sartoris had more talent, but Mrs. Kemble had the greater genius.\r\nThose who met her recognised it at once. I heard one who loved her best\r\nsay, ‘She married Mr. Butler because, for once in her life, she was a\r\nfool. He was very faulty as a husband, but she was so imperious, _no\r\none_ could have lived with dear Mrs. Kemble.’\r\n\r\n“When Mr. Cummings was taking the duty in the chapel at Dresden, they\r\nlived in the same house. Mrs. Cummings wishing to be civil, after some\r\ntime sent her card, and asked if she might wait on Mrs. Kemble. The\r\ndaughter came up at once and explained, very civilly, that her mother\r\nnow saw no one, so Mrs. Cummings thought no more about it. But some\r\ntime after, as she was sitting alone in her room, came a tap at the\r\ndoor, and on her opening it, she saw a lady in black velvet and lace,\r\nclosely veiled, who startled her by saying in sepulchral accents, ‘I’m\r\ncome to say that I shall never come again.’--‘Oh, is that really you,\r\nMrs. Butler?’ said lively little Mrs. Cummings, and the sound of her\r\nreal name, unheard for years, made her quite pleasant, and she came in,\r\nand was glad to hear of many mutual friends in the Berkshire of\r\nMassachusetts. But unfortunately Mrs. Cummings made some allusion to\r\nShakspeare, and ‘I did not come here to speak of Shakspeare,’ said Mrs.\r\nKemble in her most awful accents, and the charm was broken.\r\n\r\n“When in Boston long ago, while she was reading in public, she ordered\r\ndresses, pink and blue satin, at the great shop, the Marshall &\r\nSnelgrove of the town, but gave no address. The shopmen were afraid to\r\nask her. The manager felt he must run after her and ask where the things\r\nshould be sent. Unfortunately, to attract her attention, he touched her.\r\n‘Unhand me, ruffian,’ she shouted in her most ferocious tone. ‘And such\r\nwas the man’s terror,’ said my informant, ‘that, though he was quite\r\nyoung, his hair was turned white that night.’\r\n\r\n“From personal vanity she was absolutely free. Miss Hosmer once\r\nexpressed her regret that she had been photographed in a hat--‘We would\r\nso much rather have seen your head.’--‘My dear,’ said Mrs. Kemble, ‘my\r\nsister, and my friends, and you yourself expressed a wish to possess my\r\nphotograph, so, as I was passing a photographer’s shop, I just went in\r\nand flopped down and was photographed as I was.’\r\n\r\n“A lady was once alluding to the hope she entertained of reducing her\r\nfigure. In her most tragical voice Mrs. Kemble said, dwelling on every\r\nsyllable, ‘With a hereditary tendency to fat, nor exercise, nor diet,\r\nnor grief may avail.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MRS. C. VAUGHAN _and_ JOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Longford Castle, Salisbury, Jan. 18._--I have been five days in this\r\nmagnificent old place, and it has been a very interesting visit--and\r\nweird, from being with people to whom the other world is so very near,\r\nwho seem to be as intimate with the dead as with the living, and who\r\nthink no more of ‘receiving a message’ from one of their ‘guiding\r\nspirits’ than we should of a note from an ordinary acquaintance. These\r\nspirits, the wise ‘Huldah,’ the scientific ‘Iganesis,’ the sympathetic\r\n‘Echord,’ the evangelistic ‘Ernest,’ and ‘Semirus,’ the wise physician,\r\nare the friends of the Radnors’ daily life. There comes a rap, such a\r\nnoise as we should speak of as ‘only the furniture,’ and then it is\r\nsupposed that one of the spirits has something to say, and a pencil is\r\nput into the hand of a medium. One cannot say that she writes, for she\r\noften even goes fast asleep! but _it_ writes, frequently volumes--not\r\nthe sprawling incomprehensible stuff which I have often seen before from\r\n‘Planchette,’ but clear MS. in different handwritings, and purporting to\r\ncome from one of the spiritual friends. Personally, I should say that\r\nmost of these communications were not the least worth the immense\r\namount of time and thought given to them. The letters--‘messages’--from\r\nEchord and Ernest, are excellent certainly, but mild and affectionate\r\nreligious platitudes, such as might be written by an Evangelical\r\nclergyman of rather poetical tendencies. They all, however, speak of the\r\ndead as not asleep, but in action: of there being no ‘place,’ but ‘a\r\nstate’ after death: of existence after death being a process through\r\ngradations. None of the spirits have seen ‘God,’ but ‘the dear Master,’\r\n‘the sweet Master,’ is ever with them and amongst them. The\r\ncommunications from Semirus are more important. He is the great\r\nphysician, and his advice has provided means of healing and safety for\r\nnumbers, where earthly physicians have proved powerless or helpless. The\r\nBishop of Salisbury has been scandalised at the state of things at\r\nLongford and felt impelled to come and testify against it. He recognised\r\nall that happened as fact, as every one must, but denounced it as\r\n‘devilry,’ saying that the owners of the castle were risking their own\r\nsouls and all the souls around them. They answer: ‘It was said to\r\nChrist, Thou hast a devil.’\r\n\r\n“The great medium is Miss K. Wingfield, now aged about twenty-six. The\r\nRadnors have known her and her family most intimately for many years,\r\nand are certain of her absolute trustworthiness with regard to what she\r\nhears or writes. She is almost as a daughter to them, and they have\r\nwatched the development of her psychical powers, through various steps,\r\nwith the greatest interest. Her most remarkable gift is automatic\r\nwriting, which has been given in many languages, several with which she\r\nis wholly unacquainted (including a very old form of Chinese, only\r\ndecipherable at the British Museum), and in many different handwritings.\r\nWhen her hand writes, or rather the pencil in her hand, she has never\r\nthe least idea of what is being written. A divining rod has unfailing\r\npower in her hands.\r\n\r\n“The really remarkable communications are those which have reference to\r\nHistory. In August 1889, Sir Joseph (then Mr.) Barnby, came down to\r\nLongford to play the organ at Lady Skelmersdale’s marriage. One day at\r\nthis time Miss Wingfield’s hand wrote a communication in strange\r\nold-fashioned characters, which purported to come from one ‘John\r\nLongland.’ When asked why he came, he said that he had been brought ‘by\r\nthe influence of Mr. Barnby, whose music he had heard in Eton College\r\nChapel, where he was buried.’ Later in the day, the party went to\r\nSalisbury Cathedral, and while Lady Radnor and Miss Wingfield were\r\nsitting in the Hungerford Chapel (the freehold family pew of the Radnor\r\nfamily), Mr. Barnby played. Whilst he was playing, Miss Wingfield saw,\r\nas in a vision, various scenes enacted, culminating in a procession of\r\nmonks and other ecclesiastics with banners and canopies: one of these, a\r\ngrave-faced man, came up to the chapel and looked in at her through the\r\nbars. At the same time he announced (by loud raps on the wainscot, which\r\nis the ordinary means of communication) that he was John Longland, that\r\nit was he who had written in the morning, and that he had come to the\r\ncathedral because he had been Dean there in 1514, and that he had more\r\nto tell. Another vision in the cathedral showed the gorgeous ceremonial\r\nof a consecration, which was announced to be that of one Brian Duppa,\r\nBishop of Salisbury: in a third vision, Brian Duppa was again seen,\r\nlying dead in his coffin.\r\n\r\n“On reaching Longford, Miss Wingfield received more writing from John\r\nLongland, who described himself as anxious to confess how faithless he\r\nhad been to his intimate friendship with Thomas Bullen (Anne’s father);\r\nthat he had been instrumental in persuading Henry VIII. to divorce\r\nCatherine and to marry Anne, thus advancing his friend’s daughter, and\r\nthat afterwards--entirely from motives of personal pique against his\r\nformer friend--he had influenced Henry against Anne, and fostered\r\nsuspicions which led to her execution. He again said that he was buried\r\nin Eton College Chapel.\r\n\r\n“Anxious to verify these statements, Mr. Wingfield (Coldstream Guards)\r\npurposely went to Eton to search for the tomb of John Longland, and\r\nnowhere could it be found. The Radnors and Miss Wingfield then thought\r\nthat John Longland must be a ‘lying spirit,’ and not finding any record\r\nof his being Dean of Salisbury either, they tore up his writings.\r\n\r\n“After Mr. Barnby had left Longford, John Longland came again, but no\r\none would listen to him. He was, however, so persistent, that the\r\nRadnors decided to have a hunt for a list of officers of the cathedral.\r\nIn a lobby cupboard they discovered some old volumes of county history,\r\nuncut and covered with dust. In one of these they found that John\r\nLongland had been Dean of Salisbury at the date mentioned, and that he\r\nwas translated to Lincoln in 1521. Turning to ‘Britton’s Lincolnshire,’\r\nequally covered with dust, showing it had not been moved for months (so\r\nthat there was no possibility of Miss Wingfield having seen the\r\nstatement), it was found that Bishop John Longland was a person of great\r\nlearning and piety, &c., that he was confessor to Henry VIII., and\r\nsuspected of having unduly influenced the King with regard to Catherine\r\nand Anne, &c. He died at Woburn, and was privately buried in Eton\r\nCollege Chapel, of which he was ‘visitor,’ his heart being sent to\r\nLincoln.[511] The Radnors afterwards learnt that the tombstone of\r\nLongland was removed from Eton College Chapel during a ‘restoration.’\r\n\r\n“Some time after, when Miss Wingfield went for the first time to the\r\nPalace at Salisbury with Lady Radnor, she exclaimed, ‘There is my Bishop\r\nthat I saw!’ and went straight up to a portrait on which the name of\r\nBrian Duppa was found to be inscribed in very small characters.\r\n\r\n“The day after I came was Sunday--thick snow without, with bright\r\nsunshine, which together threw a glorious light on the pictures. Lady\r\nRadnor showed them all delightfully. Amongst those which remain in one’s\r\nmind are a delightful full-length of his boy by Rubens in the Long\r\nParlour, which the family chiefly inhabit, and the ‘Child Feeding\r\nChickens,’ and Mrs. Edward Bouverie and her child, by Reynolds, in the\r\ngreat saloon. In the Long Gallery are two grand Claudes and a steel\r\nchair of enormous value, the delicate work of one Thomas Ruker, given\r\nby the city of Augsburg to Rudolph II. in 1577. This gallery opens on\r\none side toward the chapel, with the font in which little Lucius Hare,\r\nson of Lord Coleraine, who once lived here, was baptized; and on the\r\nother to a sort of ‘Tribune’ with the choicest pictures--the Egidius of\r\nQuentin Matsys, the Erasmus of Holbein, a fine Sebastian del Piombo, and\r\na glorious Paris Bordone of a scornful beauty--‘Violante’--in a red\r\nvelvet dress. In a passage is the curious portrait of Mrs. Honeywood,\r\naged ninety-three, who had 367 descendants at the time of her death. She\r\nis represented with a glass goblet. In her great age she was sure she\r\nwas doomed to eternal damnation. ‘I am as certain to be lost,’ she said,\r\n‘as that goblet is to be broken to pieces,’ and she dashed it to the\r\nground, and it rolled away quite unhurt. So after that she remained\r\nperfectly satisfied that all would be well with her. But the pictures\r\nwhich interested me most personally were the noble Vandyke of my\r\ngreat-great-great-great-grandmother, Margaret Carey, Countess of\r\nMonmouth, and the Holbein of Mary Boleyn, who married William Carey, and\r\nwas also my grandmother by just ten removes.\r\n\r\n“The house is built in a triangle, with three round towers at the\r\nangles, known as the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Lord Radnor told me\r\nhow, when he walked out with his father every summer evening, as they\r\nneared the house he always saw his father take off his hat, look up at\r\nthe windows, and bow three times. When his father died he often\r\nregretted that he had never liked to ask him why he did this. But now\r\nhe _had_ asked his father’s spirit through a medium, and the spirit\r\nanswered that he had always repented not having told him the cause, in\r\nan old distich, which he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    ‘Owner of Longford, whoe’er you be,\r\n     Turn and bow with bends full three,\r\n     And call on the name of the Trinitie,\r\n     Or castle and lands will pass from thee.’\r\n\r\nAnd since that he had always done the same.\r\n\r\n“In one of the round towers is a pleasant room with ancient panelling of\r\nwhite and gold. This is now Lady Radnor’s boudoir, and here she has\r\noften sung to us delightfully. The grounds, with their two rivers, and\r\nthe garden with its terraces and vases and yew-hedges, are enchanting.\r\nThe younger son, Stuart Bouverie, called ‘Toby’ in the family, is, at\r\nfourteen, a clever mechanician.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of February 1893, my dear old cousin Charlotte Leycester\r\ndied peacefully at her house in London. For months past she had been\r\nfailing in her great age (ninety-five) as to physical powers, but her\r\nmind was as much alive as ever, and her affection and sympathy as warm\r\nand ready. “She seemed,” as I have read in the novel “Diana Tempest,” to\r\n“have reached a quiet backwater in the river of life, where the pressure\r\nof the current could no longer reach her, would never reach her again.”\r\nIn the last days of her own life, my dearest mother begged me always to\r\nbe all I possibly could to this dear cousin and friend of her whole\r\nlife, and I believe that I have been able to fulfil her wishes. She has\r\nhad a home at Holmhurst every summer, and I have never allowed a week,\r\ngenerally not three days, to pass without writing to her. She carries\r\naway with her my closest link with the past, but no one could wish to\r\nkeep her here. Better that she should go in her great age before the\r\nsuffering of age came.\r\n\r\nJust when her gentle life flickered out in sleep, I read in Grinnell’s\r\n“Pawnee Hero Stories”--“The sun was glad. He gave them great age. They\r\nwere never sick. When they were very old, one morning their children\r\nsaid, ‘Awake, rise and eat.’ They did not move. In the night, in sleep,\r\nwithout pain, their shadows had departed for the sandhills.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ HUGH BRYANS.\r\n\r\n“_June 20, 1893._--I was in London a long time, but saw and heard little\r\nof interest. At Mr. Knowles’s one day I met the honest sturdy Miss\r\nOctavia Hill, and another day Bret Harte, a young-old man, with white\r\nhair and an unwrinkled rosy face. It was odd to hear him called ‘Mr.\r\nHarte.’ After luncheon Mr. Knowles read Tennyson’s ‘Boadicea’ in a\r\nweird monotonous kind of chaunt, imitating him exactly, I should think.\r\nHe said that was the way Tennyson always wished his poems to be\r\nread--straight on, without emphasis or any change of voice. One day I\r\nwent with the Lowthers to draw at Fulham, and we had tea delightfully in\r\nthe open air with the Bishop and Mrs. Temple, he helping his boy\r\nmeanwhile to do Latin verses. George Lefevre had a great pleasant party\r\nat the old palace at Kew, to which we went by the river, and where we\r\nsaw the Tecks with their daughter and the Duke of York a very little\r\nwhile before their marriage. For this I saw the picturesque procession\r\ncapitally.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ VISCOUNT HALIFAX.\r\n\r\n“_October 20, 1893._--I have been little away from home all summer,\r\nbeing so busy with my Waterford Memorial, at which I have certainly\r\nworked _con amore_.\r\n\r\n“One little frisk I have had to Montacute, whence Mrs. Phelips took me\r\nto see two fine old houses, Barrington, and Wolferton near Dorchester.\r\nThen I was three pleasant days with Lord Arthur Hervey, the delightful\r\nold Bishop of Bath and Wells, in his moated fortified palace, as\r\npicturesque and as beautiful as it could possibly be. How attractive is\r\nall the apple-filled neighbourhood of Avalon--‘the Apple Island’--and\r\nhow delightful its legends of Arthur if one seeks them.\r\n\r\n“‘As Arthur ever still in British memory lives,’ says the inscription at\r\nCardeña on the tomb of the Cid, but I fear few think of him where he\r\nlived. The Bishop took me to Cheddar. How very grand it is! We mounted\r\nby a coombe into the hills, and so descended upon the gorge. ‘Imagine\r\nyourself a river working its way down,’ said the Bishop, as the narrow\r\nravine opened beneath us with its great purple rocks in labyrinthine\r\nwindings of inexpressible beauty. Very lovely, too, I thought the little\r\nlake at the bottom, covered with a kind of ranunculus unknown elsewhere.\r\n\r\n“The Bishop talks freely on all subjects with perfect ease and\r\nsimplicity, in the repose of a mind at rest and the humility of real\r\nknowledge. He was much occupied with the question as to whether the\r\nchildren of Israel were 200 or 400 years in the wilderness, all\r\ndepending upon where a stop ought to be placed. He was also full of\r\nderivations of names, and mentioned several interesting ones--Bevan, ap\r\nEvan; Bethel, ap Ithil; Coblentz, confluence; and Snowdon and Ben Nevis,\r\nmeaning the same thing. He talked of having known Madame de Gontaut long\r\nago, and how, when Louis XVIII. did something she could not approve, she\r\nalways turned his portrait to the wall. The last time he went to see\r\nher, the servant said, ‘Depuis qu’elle est en enfance, Madame la\r\nDuchesse ne reçoit pas.’ He told of having been in his childhood at the\r\nball which George IV. gave to children, and how a little girl being\r\nasked there what she would like to have, said, ‘I should like to have\r\ntoo much.’ In his room hung a beautiful engraving from Millet’s\r\n‘Angelus,’ which he aptly called ‘the picture of the good lout’[512]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BROADHURST.][513]\r\n\r\n“Later, for my little ‘Sussex’ book, I was four days wandering about the\r\ndeep sandy lanes and semi-forest tracts in the central part of the\r\ncounty. One of the prettiest places was Broadhurst, near Horsted Keynes,\r\nwhere the saintly Archbishop Leighton passed the last years of his life,\r\nand taught his sister’s children and grandchildren under the old oaks. I\r\nslept two nights at Groombridge Place, a delightful house, little\r\naltered since it was built in James I.’s time, and with three terraced\r\ngardens, and peacocks innumerable sunning themselves on the grey\r\nparapet of the wall above the moat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROOMBRIDGE PLACE.][514]\r\n\r\n“At Holmhurst I have been much alone, and I feel, with Carlyle, that\r\n‘the memory of many things which it is not at all good to forget rises\r\nwith strange clearness on me in these solitudes, very touching, very\r\nsad, out of the depths of old dead years.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe only incidents of my autumn were visits to Sir Raymond and Lady\r\nBurrell at Knepp Castle, containing one of the finest collections of\r\nportraits to be found at any small place in England; and to the Palace\r\nat Chichester, where the noble old Bishop Durnford seemed at ninety-one\r\nmore full of tireless energy than ever, and whence I was taken to visit\r\nthe site of the original bishopric, Selsey, with its lichen-covered\r\nwalls and storm-beaten gravestones.\r\n\r\nIn December, whilst staying at ever-pleasant Thorncombe with my cousin\r\nVictoria Rowe, I sat for my portrait to Mr. Eddis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 5, 1893._--I had a delightful morning with Mr. Eddis, now\r\neighty-three, but full of vigour and vivacity, and still more of\r\nreminiscence. He said, ‘You would not have been here now having your\r\nportrait painted if it had not been for the Athenaeum. When I was a very\r\nyoung man, one Magrath, who was secretary there, told me he wanted a\r\nsketch made of himself, and that he would give me £5 for one. So I did\r\nit, and it was such a success, that no fewer than sixty members of the\r\nclub put their names down to be drawn by me. I was doubtful if I should\r\ndo them, for I wanted to study, and I had not studied enough, but I\r\nasked Hilton, who was a very good artist then, and he told me it would\r\nbe folly to refuse what came so easily; and so I did the portraits, and\r\nfrom that time orders have poured in all through my long life, and so I\r\nhave never had time for real study since: I have only learnt through my\r\nwork.’\r\n\r\n“‘What one learns most by experience is the value of reflected light. I\r\nonce had a discussion with Gladstone about what was the brightest colour\r\nin Nature. He maintained red was: he was perfectly certain, and very\r\ndetermined in his opinion. I said blue was. I told him how, in the\r\nevening, when all was mysterious, the red flowers in the garden\r\ndisappeared, but the blue remained visible. But he was unconvinced. Then\r\nI showed him how, in a photograph of a flower-bed, the red flowers\r\nremained dead, undetached from the leaves, but the blue flowers were\r\nlight and visible in all their forms. Then--“Good night, Mr. Eddis,” he\r\nsaid.’\r\n\r\n“‘Did you know D’Israeli?’ said Mr. Eddis. ‘No, he must have been before\r\nyour time, but I used to meet him often. He always struck me as _lying\r\nin wait for points_: to make a point was what he cared for most.\r\n\r\n“‘James Croker had much to do with the building of the Athenaeum. They\r\nwanted him--the members did--to make an icehouse for them, but he\r\nwouldn’t. Afterwards some one found in a waste-paper basket a couplet he\r\nhad written--\r\n\r\n    ‘My name is James Croker, I’ll do as I please;\r\n     You wish for an ice-house, I’ll give you a frieze.’\r\n\r\n“‘Sydney Smith did not make at the time all the jokes which were\r\nattributed to him: he thought of them afterwards, and circulated them.\r\nHe told me once, for instance, that Landseer had asked him to sit for\r\nhis portrait, and that he had answered, “How could I possibly refuse a\r\nchance of immortality,” which was perhaps a very natural thing to say.\r\nBut it was reported afterwards in London, and reported with at least his\r\nconsent, that he had answered, “Is thy servant a dog, that I should do\r\nthis thing?”\r\n\r\n“‘One of his best real sayings was of Dr. Whewell--“Science is his\r\nforte, omniscience his passion.”\r\n\r\n“‘Macaulay, it is true, talked incessantly--talked like a machine, but\r\nhe had his attractive points. I found this out especially when he\r\nbrought the present Lady Knutsford, as a very little girl, to me to be\r\npainted, and talked nonsense to her the whole time, but it was always\r\nnonsense which had a lesson in it.\r\n\r\n“‘Lady Waterford was the most glorious specimen of womanhood I ever saw.\r\nShe came in with Lady Canning when I was drawing the Archbishop of\r\nArmagh[515]--“the Beauty of Holiness,” as he was called. Lady Canning\r\nhad the lovelier face and the more beautiful eyes, but Lady Waterford\r\nwas always the more striking from the grand pose of her head and her\r\nmajestic mien. In seeing her, one felt as if one looked upon a goddess.’\r\n\r\n“This afternoon Victoria took me to see Mr. Watts.[516] A drive through\r\nwooded lanes and water-meadows; then the carriage stopped at the foot of\r\na wooded knoll, and we walked up little winding paths through the\r\nbracken and Scotch firs to the house--a rustic hermitage. You enter\r\ndirectly upon the principal dwelling apartment--two low rooms, with old\r\ncarved furniture and deep windows, and much colour and many pictures.\r\nThe ceiling is in panels, decorated in stucco by Mrs. Watts (_née_\r\nFraser Tytler). At least she has finished one room, and is going to do\r\nthe other with an epitome of the religion of all the nations of the\r\nearth--‘A work,’ she said, ‘which gives me much study.’\r\n\r\n“Soon Mr. Watts came in, like a pilgrim, like a mediaeval hermit-saint,\r\nin a brown blouse and slippers, with a skull-cap above his white hair\r\nand beard, and his sharp eager features, in which there is also\r\nboundless tenderness and refinement. He sat by me on the window-sill,\r\nand began at once to talk of Lady Waterford--of her wonderful\r\ninspirations, her unrivalled colouring, her utter unconsciousness of\r\nself, and her majestic beauty--how, when he first saw her out walking at\r\nBlickling, with her grand mien, he could not but exclaim--‘It is Pallas\r\nAthene herself!’\r\n\r\n“He regretted that she should never have been painted in later life.\r\n‘When she came into a studio, it was like a glorious vision.’ His wife\r\nsaid how often he spoke of Lady Waterford, and that to herself it was a\r\nlifelong regret that she should never have looked upon one who so\r\noccupied his thoughts and admiration.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Watts took us into his studio, an immense and beautiful room added\r\nto the cottage. Here were many of his pictures, the work of years, on\r\nwhich, from time to time, he adds a few touches. He likes to have many\r\nof his works around him, and to add to them thus.\r\n\r\n“At the end of the room hangs his vast ‘Court of Death,’ which can be\r\nlowered by pulleys whenever he wishes to add to it. He was greatly\r\npleased with a photograph of it, which has the effect of a Tintoretto,\r\nand which, while preserving the grand masses, blots out the detail.\r\n‘Death’ is throned in the upper part of the picture. ‘I have given her\r\nwings,” said Mr. Watts, ‘that she may not seem like a Madonna. In her\r\narms nestles a child--a child unborn, perhaps, who has taken refuge\r\nthere. By her side the angels of silence guard the portals of the\r\nunseen. Beneath is the altar of Death, to which many worshippers are\r\nhastening: the old mendicant comes to beg; the noble offers his coronet;\r\nthe warrior does not offer--but surrenders--his sword; the sick girl\r\nclings for refuge to the feet of Death. I have wished to paint Death\r\nentirely without terrors.\r\n\r\n“‘You wonder what that is, that other picture of a figure of a rich man\r\nin Eastern dress whose face is half-hidden, buried away in the folds of\r\nhis garment. I meant that for the man who was “very sorry, for he had\r\ngreat possessions.” He cannot give them up. He has tried, but he\r\n_cannot_. He is going out into the world again, and yet--and yet he is\r\nvery sorry. I have only got to give him a number of rings and to put a\r\ngold chain round him, and I think his story will be told.’\r\n\r\n“‘And that great picture?’ we asked. ‘Oh, that is the Angel of Rest. He\r\nhas come to that old man, by whom all the instruments of music and\r\nscience are lying, that weary old man, and he is touching his hand and\r\nbidding him come with him and rest.’\r\n\r\n“Besides these, Mr. Watts produced from a corner a grand chalk portrait\r\nof Lady De Vesci--a most noble picture, giving all the dignity and all\r\nthe sympathy and pity of her expression. Mr. Watts said he was going to\r\ngive it to her little girl.\r\n\r\n“He said, ‘I am within two years of eighty, and I have worked all my\r\nlife, but I do not feel old or feeble. I do not even use a maul-stick,\r\nand I intend to do my best work yet.’\r\n\r\n“On the walls were photographs from Lady Waterford’s drawings, placed\r\nbeside Titians, and in their ideas as fine.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Watts took me to the window of the other room to look out into ‘the\r\nhalf-clothed trees of the winter world.’ In the foreground, a number of\r\ncocoa-nuts, open at the ends, were hung up, and wrens and other tiny\r\nbirds were fluttering in and out of them. ‘They like cocoa-nut,’ he\r\nsaid, ‘and I like to see them enjoy it.’\r\n\r\n“He said he had no wish to go into the world again. Living was\r\noutliving. Holland House, the second home of many years, was swept away\r\nfor him, and all its intimates were passing away, and its memories\r\nperishing. Nothing else in London could attract him.\r\n\r\n“He had wished to make large pictures of Hope, Charity, and Faith. With\r\nthe two first he had no difficulty, but he lingered long over the third.\r\nHe showed us the picture he had done--of a woman seated, looking\r\nupwards, an Amazonian woman, sheathing her sword, and bathing her\r\nblood-stained feet in a brook of clear water. ‘She had found out that\r\nall that was no use--no use at all.’ His words, his thoughts, his works,\r\nall seemed imbued with the truest spirit of religion. ‘With theology,’\r\nhe said, ‘I have nothing to do.’\r\n\r\n“He said he had no models. ‘Models are well as studies to draw from, but\r\nthey check inspiration.’ He rejoiced in Lady Waterford’s using no models\r\nfor her smaller pictures, and said she would not have been so truly\r\ngreat had she done so.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 7._--Another delightful sitting with Mr. Eddis. I told him of our\r\nvisit to Watts, and he said how he felt, on seeing his pictures and\r\nthose of Alma Tadema, that Watts was the head, while Tadema was only the\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“He talked of his own early life as a student. At that time, Fuseli[517]\r\nhad recently been the head of the Academy--the very fierce head. He used\r\nto say to his pupils, ‘You may be very good buttermen, you may be very\r\ngood cheesemen, but students of Art you will never be; and now, give me\r\nmy umbrella, and I’ll go and look at Constable’s pictures.’\r\n\r\n“‘Turner[518] often used to come in and look at us and our work. There\r\nwas a student amongst us who had painted in a red background, and he\r\npainted it the crudest, brightest red he could manage. Turner came in\r\nand said, “Come now, this will never do; give me your palette and\r\nbrush,” and in a few minutes he had toned and mellowed it down with a\r\nhundred delicate gradations of tint. “Well now, don’t you think it’s\r\nimproved?” said Turner. “No, I don’t,” answered the man; “I think it\r\nwas much better before,” which annoyed Turner rather.\r\n\r\n“‘I remember that he came to me that day. I was copying a Vandyke, and\r\nhe looked at my work. “Part of that is very good,” he said; “why isn’t\r\nall the rest as good?”--“Because,” I said, “all the rest is me, and that\r\npart is an accident.”--“Well, let that accident to-day become principle\r\nto-morrow,” said Turner, and we were always rather friends afterwards.\r\n\r\n“‘Turner was proud of his picture of Carthage. He had received many\r\nmortifications about his pictures, and people had haggled about the\r\nprices--very small prices too--that he asked for them. When Lord Francis\r\nEgerton came and told him that a subscription was on foot to buy that\r\npicture from him and present it to the National Gallery, he burst into\r\ntears, he was so moved. But he said, “No, I will not sell it, but I will\r\nleave it to the National Gallery.”\r\n\r\n“‘Afterwards, however, he changed his mind, and wished to be buried in\r\nthat picture. He spoke of it to Chantrey, who was his executor, and\r\nbegged that he would see that it was done, urging him to promise that it\r\nshould be done. “Yes, since you wish it, I’ll see you buried in that\r\npicture,” said Chantrey, “but, as sure as you’re alive now, I’ll see you\r\ndug up again.”\r\n\r\n“‘Eventually the picture was left to the National Gallery.\r\n\r\n“‘I was very near becoming an Academician,’ said Mr. Eddis, ‘but I never\r\ndid. I had painted a picture of the “Raising of Jairus’s Daughter,”\r\nwhich was considered a good thing, and my election was thought certain.\r\nI was advised to call upon some of the principal members, not to ask\r\nthem to vote for me, but to conciliate them by the attention. It went\r\nrather against the grain with me, and I asked Stanfield about it. “Your\r\nelection is as certain,” said Stanfield, “as that I am sitting upon this\r\nsofa, but you may perhaps hasten it a little if you call as you’ve been\r\nadvised.” I never did, however; I let it slip, and I was never elected.\r\nThen younger men cropped up, and I was forgotten: it was all as well,\r\nperhaps.’\r\n\r\n“In the afternoon Victoria took me to Lady Sligo’s new house, to which,\r\ninstead of the suitable name of Altamont,[519] she has insisted on\r\ngiving that of Mount Brown. It is beautifully situated on a wooded\r\nplatform above the town of Guildford. I thought the inside of the house\r\nvery charming, but Frank Thomas, the architect, who was with us,\r\nobjected because ‘there was too little of the architect, and too much of\r\nLady Sligo in it,’ which seemed to me just its greatest recommendation.\r\n\r\n“‘May I tum in?’ said a little boy, knocking at his little sister’s\r\ndoor. ‘No, oo mayn’t,’ answered the little sister. ‘May I tum in now?’\r\nsaid the little boy. ‘Yes, oo may,’ answered the little sister. ‘And why\r\nmightn’t I tum in before?’ said the little boy. ‘Because Mammy said oo\r\nwasn’t to see me in my chemise, and now I’ve taken it off,’ answered the\r\nlittle sister.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 8._--‘I see some pictures by amateurs,’ said Mr. Eddis this\r\nmorning, ‘which produce the same effect that _we was_ does in\r\nconversation: it is because they have never studied the grammar of art.\r\n\r\n“‘You would scarcely remember Chantrey, I think. He was always a kind\r\nfriend to me. He rose quite from the ranks, and began as a carver of\r\nwood. Rogers was always said to have a table which had been carved by\r\nChantrey.\r\n\r\n“‘Lord Eldon sat to me three times, and, while he sat, told me all the\r\nstory of his life, so when that Life was published, it was all familiar\r\nto me: he had told it all. He was unsuccessful as a lawyer in early\r\nlife, had no practice whatever, and his friends advised him to throw up\r\nthe profession altogether. Only two friends urged him to wait just a\r\nlittle longer, and he took their advice, and in that “little longer” the\r\ntide turned, and carried him on to the Chancellorship: “And then,” said\r\nLord Eldon, “I was able to provide those two friends with very good\r\nplaces.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn December 1893 my “Story of Two Noble Lives” appeared, and was warmly\r\nwelcomed by the upper classes of society--“the public” for whom it was\r\nespecially written. The last time I had gone out with Lady Waterford, we\r\nwalked up and down the little ilex avenue by the churchyard at\r\nHighcliffe. She spoke then of the great and increasing desolation of her\r\nlife, and said, “If I survive Charles Stuart, there will not be any one\r\nleft who would even put up a monument to me.” At the time I inwardly\r\nsaid, “I will,” and held firm to that resolution; and from what people\r\nsay of the book, I feel that I may venture to regard it, though very\r\nunworthy, as a memorial of my dear Lady and her so-beloved sister. Lady\r\nCanning’s is the better portrait, for her letters remained; the\r\ndestruction of all Lady Waterford’s best letters has prevented an\r\nequally good picture of her life being produced. General Stuart and many\r\nother of Lady Waterford’s friends assured me that a detailed memoir of\r\nher was impossible; but no good work was ever successfully carried\r\nthrough which has not at one time seemed impossible.\r\n\r\nIt was curious, on going to London, to see how opinions differed about\r\nthe book--how one heard, “Oh, all the interest is confined to Lady\r\nCanning,” or, “Of course all one’s sympathies are with Lady Waterford;\r\nit is only Lady Waterford one cares for,” or, “The old French history is\r\nthe only point of interest.” The Reviews were just the same, wishing\r\nthat the first, or the second, or the third volume were excluded--“the\r\ngeneral public would have been sure to welcome the book if it had been\r\nmuch shorter.” But that was exactly the welcome I did not care that it\r\nshould receive. The general public had no interest in, could not\r\nunderstand, and was not constituted to benefit by such “noble lives,”\r\nwhile the inner circle for whom they were intended could always\r\nskip--skip a whole volume if it pleased, just as suited the reader. “Le\r\nplus grand malheur d’un homme de lettres n’est peut-être pas d’être\r\nl’objet de la jalousie de ses confrères, la victime de la cabale, le\r\nmépris des puissants du monde; c’est d’être jugé par des sots.” I was,\r\nhowever, very grateful for the letter of “a Radical,” well known, though\r\nquite unknown to me, who wrote that the book had shown him that he had\r\noften talked and written of what he had known nothing about, of a class\r\nhe had misjudged or judged only from individuals, and that “the Story”\r\nhad taught him what noble, devoted, unselfish lives might belong to the\r\nclass he had maligned, and that he would never speak against it--in\r\ngeneralities--again. Lady Cork was furious because the married life of\r\nLord and Lady Canning had not been painted as cloudlessly, beatifically\r\nhappy. But how could I do this with all the written evidence before me?\r\nAnd, after all, what made Lady Canning’s so perfectly “noble” a life was\r\nthat, however much she suffered, she allowed her mother and sister to\r\nlive and _die_ under the impression that she was the happiest of wives.\r\n\r\nA very large first edition--5300 copies--was produced. I felt these\r\nwould be called for, and that such an edition would probably cover the\r\nvery heavy expenses. But the sale of the book is not likely to go on;\r\nthe generation contemporary with the two sisters will have passed away.\r\nFor myself, if I like a book, I prefer that it should be very long. It\r\nenables you to make a real acquaintance with the people described, to\r\nlearn to love them perhaps, and to be very sorry to part with them. I\r\nwonder if it will be so if some of these--very long--journals are ever\r\nmade public.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Augustus J C Hare\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph by Elliott & Fry]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\nWRITING THE GURNEY MEMOIRS\r\n\r\n                      “O thou wealthy Past,\r\n    Thine are our treasures!--thine and ours alone\r\n    Through thee: the Present doth in fear rejoice;\r\n    The Future, but in fantasy: but thou\r\n    Holdest secure for ever and for ever\r\n    The bliss that has been ours; nor present woe,\r\n    Nor future dread, can touch that heritage\r\n    Of joy gone by--the only joy we own.”\r\n              --FANNY ANNE KEMBLE.\r\n\r\n     “The stream bears us on, and our joys and our griefs are alike left\r\n     behind us: we may be shipwrecked, but we cannot be delayed: whether\r\n     rough or smooth, the river hastens towards its home, till the\r\n     roaring of the ocean is in our ears, and the tossing of the waves\r\n     is beneath our keel, and the lands lessen from our eyes, and the\r\n     floods are lifted up around us, and the earth loses sight of us,\r\n     and we take our last leave of earth and its inhabitants, and of our\r\n     further voyage there is no witness, but the Infinite and the\r\n     Eternal.”--REGINALD HEBER, _Farewell Sermon at Hodnet_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had frequently been urged by my friend Madame E. de Bunsen to write\r\nthe lives and edit the letters of her family--the Gurneys of Earlham;\r\nbut I had long declined. Much as I honoured the life-work and character\r\nof the Gurneys, I felt that I was so little in sympathy with their\r\noutward forms of religion, with their peculiar expression of it--with\r\ntheir religious talking, in fact--that I doubted if I could do them\r\njustice. Others seemed much better fitted for the task.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLHAM HALL][520]\r\n\r\nBut towards the close of 1893 it was again urged upon me--urged with\r\ngreat persistency; and when I had taken many of the Gurney journals and\r\nletters home, a memoir seemed gradually to unravel itself in my mind,\r\nand at length I promised to do my best. I know, however, how true it is\r\nthat “in a whole imbroglio of capabilities, we go stupidly groping\r\nabout, to grope which is ours, and very often clutch the wrong\r\none.”[521]\r\n\r\nIn many respects the work soon brought its own reward--inwardly, in\r\nbeing led to enter into the spiritual life and difficulties of so many\r\nholy departed ones: outwardly, in many visits to still living members of\r\nthe family, whose life is a constant example, and has often an\r\nintellectual as well as a spiritual charm. Especially charming were some\r\nwinter days at Colne House, the delightful home of Catherine, Lady\r\nBuxton, second daughter of Samuel Gurney; and a lovely spring day with\r\nMrs. Ripley at Earlham, in the old-fashioned rooms, and on the green\r\nlawns, fragrant to the family--but also to thousands of others--with\r\nendless sacred memories.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To the_ HON. G. HYLTON JOLLIFFE.\r\n\r\n“_London, April 1894._--I have had a pleasant time here, and as usual\r\nhave found that there is more to be learnt by enduring the ups and downs\r\nof social pleasures than by withdrawing from them, while in the\r\nmornings I have been very busy at the Athenaeum with a new edition of\r\n‘Walks in London’ and the production of my little ‘Sussex.’ At Lady\r\nWynford’s I met Miss Harynden, the authoress of ‘Ships that Pass in the\r\nNight,’ a very delicate-looking brown ‘Girton girl’--only her degree was\r\nnot taken at Girton, but at the London University. She was very simple\r\nand nice, but seems to _feel_ her books too much. She said she was\r\ngenerally ill and fretful because she was writing, but more ill and more\r\nfretful if she was not. She did not find her lodging at Hampstead quiet\r\nenough to write in, but shut herself up by day in a desolate cottage on\r\nthe Heath. She said she had received hundreds of letters about her\r\n‘Ships that Pass.’ That very morning she had a very kind one from an\r\nunknown gentleman, saying he liked her book very much, but was\r\ndisappointed because--in spite of the title--he found no information\r\nabout shipping in it!\r\n\r\n“A little Gould child said the other day, ‘Can God Almighty do\r\neverything, mother?’--‘Yes, my dear, God is omnipotent.’--‘I know one\r\nthing He couldn’t do, mother.’--‘Quite impossible, my dear.’--‘Yes,\r\nmother; God couldn’t make a stone so big that He couldn’t carry\r\nit,’--deep unconscious theology.\r\n\r\n” ...There is no place where Death makes a stranger impression than at\r\nthe Athenaeum. You become so accustomed to many men you do not know, to\r\ntheir comings and goings, that they become almost a part of your daily\r\nlife. You watch them growing older, the dapper young man becoming\r\ngrizzled, first too careful and then too neglectful of his dress: you\r\nsee his face become furrowed, his hair grow grey, then white, and at\r\nlast he is lame and bent. You become worried by his coughs, and hems,\r\nand little peculiarities. And--suddenly--you are aware that he is not\r\nthere, and all your little annoyances immediately seem to have been\r\nabsurd. For a time you miss him. He never comes. He will cough no more,\r\nno longer creak across the floor. He has passed into the unseen;\r\ngradually he is forgotten. His place knows him no more. But the wheel\r\ngoes on turning; it is others; it is oneself perhaps, who is waning\r\naway.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To the_ HON. MRS. W. LOWTHER.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, May 21, 1894._--You said you would like to hear about\r\nBelvoir.\r\n\r\n“I went with Henry Maxwell-Lyte. At Grantham was a quantity of red\r\ncloth, and crowds of people to see the Princess (Louise), and a string\r\nof carriages from the castle, and George Manners to show us which we\r\nwere to go in. In mine I found a young man, who turned out to be Cecil\r\nHanbury of La Mortola, with whom I made great friends, and found, as I\r\nalways do, that it makes all the difference if one has one special\r\nfriend in a large party. The Princess was already at tea when we\r\narrived, and very gracious and kind. But though she is such a really\r\ncharming person, the conversation had the effect of muffled drums, which\r\nalways accompanies the presence of royalty. Lord Lorne is much improved\r\nin appearance by age--a good Rubens, as his uncle, Ronald Gower--also at\r\nBelvoir--is a bad Bronzino. The Duke, as always, was most delightful, so\r\ncourteous, considerate, and full of interesting information. In the\r\nmornings we walked, drew, or sat in the gardens--a many-hued carpet of\r\nspring glories. In the evenings most of the company danced. The last day\r\nwe drove, all the way through the property, to Croxton Old Park, where\r\nthere was once a monastery, but nothing is left of it now. There is a\r\nquaint little house, where the Duchess Mary-Isabella, whoever she may\r\nhave been, died, and in its succursale we had tea, with all possible\r\n‘ameliorations.’ ...\r\n\r\n“Holmhurst is now a nest of spring blossoms, the azaleas glorious, and\r\nthe gold of the laburnums quite hiding the leaves.\r\n\r\n    ‘A tout oiseau\r\n     Son nid semble beau:’\r\n\r\nBut my nest really _is_ ‘beau.’ I am sometimes blamed for caring so much\r\nabout it, so that it was a comfort to read somewhere (I cannot remember\r\nwhere), ‘Every man’s proper mansion-house and home, being the theater of\r\nhis hospitality, the seate of self-fruition, the comfortablest part of\r\nhis own life, a kind of private princedome, nay, to the possessor\r\nthereof an epitome of the whole world, may well deserve by these\r\nattributes, according to the degree of the master, to be decently and\r\ndelightfully adorned.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt had weighed upon my mind for the last two years that my “France”\r\nremained unfinished. There was still another volume which could not be\r\nwritten without personally visiting all the places of interest in\r\nNormandy and Brittany, and my publishers were constantly urging its\r\ncompletion. The book has always been utterly unremunerative, very much\r\nthe contrary, which is very depressing in its way, but “on ne vit dans\r\nle mémoire du monde que par ses travaux pour le monde.’[522] So I\r\ndetermined to give up London and home pleasures this summer, and to set\r\nabout it, taking my young cousin Theodore Chambers as my companion and\r\nguest.\r\n\r\nWe left Holmhurst together on the first of June, and spent June in\r\nNormandy and July in Brittany. It was one of the most laborious journeys\r\nI ever made--eight or nine hours a day of walking, standing, collating,\r\ncorrecting, simmering in the relaxing western heat, and constantly\r\nsoaked by the Scotch mist which pervades that district five days out of\r\nseven. For the latter month young Inverurie, Lady Kintore’s eldest boy,\r\nwas also with me, a most kind and pleasant fellow-traveller, but, though\r\neager about drawing, neither of my companions had any more interest in\r\narchitecture or history than a stone. Thus my associations with\r\nNorth-Western France are not transcendent. Places, even the most\r\nbeautiful, are innutritious to the mind in the long run; one needs\r\npeople with mental life, and enthusiasm to see them with.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONT S. MICHEL.][523]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S. JEAN DU DOIGT.][524]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT CARNAC.][525]\r\n\r\nTo the cloudiest days, however, come gleams of sunshine. I remember with\r\ngreat pleasure the Abbey of S. Waudrille near Caudebec, restored once\r\nmore to the Benedictines, ejected at the Revolution. We were cordially\r\npressed to go and stay there, and shown the charming rooms we might\r\nhave, and I should really have liked it. Then five days at Mont S.\r\nMichel were enchanting, and the invigorating air, which the hundred and\r\nthirty steps to our bedrooms gave us full opportunity of benefiting by.\r\nAnd then from Brittany come recollections of many wonderful calvaries;\r\nof Tregastel and its golden rocks; of S. Jean du Doigt in its deep\r\nhollow, lovely in spite of soaking rain; and of Carnac and its wild\r\nmoorland, redolent of sweet basil and thyme. We also saw two stately\r\nwell-kept houses, Josselin of the Duc de Rohan, and Maintenon of the Duc\r\nde Noailles; but, after all, seeing houses without their owners is like\r\nseeing frames without portraits. More living to me, because I felt\r\nalready so familiar with the place, was Les Rochers, pervaded by the\r\nspirit of Madame de Sévigné, and even more fragrant from the memories\r\nshe has bequeathed to it than from the blossoms with which the glorious\r\nold orange-trees in its garden are covered now as in her day. It was\r\nenchanting to reach home again at the end of July. My companions said\r\nthe journey had turned my hair grey, and so it really had--rather.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LES ROCHERS.][526]\r\n\r\n“_August 16._--Most delightful has been the return to Holmhurst with its\r\nfreedom and peace. The shades in my life now are seldom troubles, only\r\nuncongenialities, and the ‘small fretting fretfulnesses’ which accompany\r\nthem: still, when these are past, the relief is enormous, and visits\r\nfrom such delightful young friends as Herbert Vaughan, Cecil Hanbury,\r\nand George Cockerton have been a great enjoyment. The last is indeed, in\r\nevery respect, a dear and true friend. No rules of friendship, I feel,\r\nare better than those inculcated by Buddhism:--\r\n\r\n“‘An honourable man should minister to his friends and companions by\r\ngiving presents, by courteous speech, by promoting their interests, by\r\ntreating them as his equals, by sharing with them his prosperity.\r\n\r\n“‘They, in return, should show attachment, by watching over him when he\r\nis off his guard, by guarding his property when he is careless, by\r\noffering him a refuge in danger, by adhering to him in misfortune, by\r\nshowing kindness to his family.’\r\n\r\n“The natural beauty of the garden here is a never-failing delight to me.\r\nMost people seem to be so full of expectations from the future that they\r\ndo not allow themselves to enjoy the present; but when I am at home, I\r\nam sure that is not the case with me. On the prettiest site in the\r\ngrounds I have just finished putting up the statues of Queen Anne and\r\nher four satellites by Bird, which formerly stood in front of St.\r\nPaul’s. They were taken away four years ago, and disappeared altogether\r\ntill last spring, when my friend Lewis Gilbertson discovered them in a\r\nstonemason’s yard on the point of being broken up for the sake of the\r\nmarble. I found they belonged to three people--the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, the Bishop of London, and the Lord Mayor, and all these were\r\npersuaded to resign their claims to me. The statues were brought down to\r\nHolmhurst at great expense, and put up, at much greater, on a home-made\r\npedestal like their old one; and now I hope they are enjoying the\r\nverdure and sea-breezes after the smoke of the City.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ W. H. MILLIGAN, _and_ JOURNAL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUEEN ANNE AT HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n“_Alderley Rectory, Oct. 5, 1894._--I left home on September 29, to\r\nvisit the Townshend Marshams at Frognal--the place I have so often heard\r\nof and thought of, from Lord and Lady Canning having been there so\r\nfrequently as the guests of Lord and Lady Sydney, who left it to the\r\nMarshams. No wonder they loved it, and that it was one of the places\r\npoor Lady Canning most looked forward to seeing again on her return\r\nfrom her long Indian exile. It is an enchanting old house!--its endless\r\nsuccession of small sitting-rooms, all lived in, all full of pictures,\r\nbooks, and flowers, and opening on to a sunny terrace and broad expanse\r\nof lawn, with pine-trees beyond it. In one of the rooms Lady Sydney\r\nstill presides from her picture, but as few alive now can remember her,\r\nradiant in loveliness, with a coronet surmounting her abundant and\r\nbeautiful hair. Upstairs there is an oak gallery, half library, half\r\npassage, but deliciously pleasant and quaint. The boy of the family is\r\nnamed Ferdinand, from Ferdinando Marsham, Charles I.’s esquire, upon\r\nwhose tombstone it is said that ‘he was lamented by all gentlemen.’\r\nAmongst the many curious pamphlets in the house is an account of Charles\r\nI.’s execution, printed whilst the king’s body was still lying at\r\nWhitehall, and mentioning his famous word, ‘Remember,’ as referring to\r\nhis ‘George,’ which he had desired might be given to his eldest son. A\r\nsketch by Lady Sydney represents the drawing-room at Frognal, with both\r\nthe Cannings and many other habitués of the house introduced, and easily\r\nrecognisable as portraits.\r\n\r\n“Through a most picturesque and lovely bit of primeval chase belonging\r\nto Frognal we walked to Chislehurst, to see the fine tomb of Lord Sydney\r\nby Boehm, surrounded by memorials of his family, and, on the common, the\r\nPrince Imperial’s Memorial Cross. Mr. Marsham Townshend, who recollected\r\nhaving seen the Empress in all her splendour at Paris, happened once to\r\ncome upon her here, a widowed and lonely exile, in her deep mourning,\r\nattended by a single servant, sobbing alone before this memorial of her\r\nmurdered son. Often, in the years she was at Chislehurst, while the\r\nfamily at Frognal were sitting at tea in the hall, a carriage would dash\r\nup, and the Empress Eugénie come in to stay for two hours. She loved the\r\nSydneys.\r\n\r\n“It was most delightful at Frognal having old Mrs. Sackville of Drayton\r\nthere--‘still constant in a wondrous excellence.’\r\n\r\n“A longish journey took me to Bromsgrove, where a carriage met me and an\r\nold Mrs. Laurence, who is apparently ‘a power’ in American society, with\r\nher nephew, Mr. Mercer, and brought us to Hewell, the great modern house\r\nwhich Bodley has built for the Windsors. It has an immense hall, with\r\nopen galleries round it, never a comfortable arrangement, I think, but\r\nit is handsome, has two beautiful Italian chimney-pieces, and is divided\r\nby arches into compartments at the two ends. Lady Windsor is quite as\r\nbeautiful and fascinating as before she married, and her mother, Lady\r\nPaget, is rather additionally embellished than otherwise by added years.\r\nLady De Vesci was at Hewell also, supremely beautiful in her own--a\r\npoetical way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BELLA’S LOGHOUSE, ALDERLEY MERE.][527]\r\n\r\n“I have enjoyed being in this familiar place, where the Rector of\r\nAlderley, Mr. Bell, and his daughters, are very kind. He has just been\r\ndriving me to see the Ernest Leycesters at Mobberley. Passing beneath a\r\nfield on the way to Chorley, he said, ‘A curious thing happened there\r\nwhen I was a little boy. A farmer went out very early to look over his\r\nland, and in that field he found a place where the soil had been\r\nrecently upturned. ‘Oh, poachers must have been here,’ he said to\r\nhimself, ‘and have buried their game;’ so he dug, and very soon came\r\nupon a sack. ‘Here it is,’ he said, when behold! from the sack emerged\r\nthe long tresses of a young woman! Pale as death, he rushed across the\r\nfield to Ellen Baskerville’s house, and told what had happened. It was\r\nthe body of a young woman, buried in Alderley Churchyard a few days\r\nbefore. Resurrection-men had dug it up, and being suddenly surprised,\r\nhad hastily buried it here.\r\n\r\n“‘When I was living as chaplain in the Infirmary at Norwich,’ said Mr.\r\nBell, ‘I was startled by hearing what seemed to be loud and furious\r\nimprecations overhead. They did not stop, and at last I ran upstairs to\r\nsee. There, in bed, was the old fat swarthy cook, screaming with all her\r\nmight, and a huge monkey was sitting on the bed grinning at her. I\r\nseized a newspaper which lay there, rolled it up, and hit out at the\r\nmonkey. But the beast knew better than to be afraid of that, seized it,\r\ntore it up, and made at me. Then I caught up a large ruler, which was\r\nhappily lying near, to defend myself with. The monkey did not like that,\r\nand bounded across the room and out at the window, and I heard a scream\r\nfrom the people upon whom it had descended in the street.\r\n\r\n“‘The woman told me how the monkey had come in at the window, and jumped\r\nstraight on to her bed, where it had found the pot of ointment used for\r\nher bad leg, and eaten it all up directly. Having finished that, it made\r\nfor the table, where it found her wig-box, pulled it open and began to\r\ndemolish her wig. _That_ she could not stand. “Oh, ye varmint! ye\r\nvarmint!” she shouted, and continued shouting till I came to the\r\nrescue.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Temple Newsam, Oct. 9._--This grand old house in the Black Country has\r\nbeen receiving the Duke and Duchess of York. They were just gone when I\r\narrived, but the Duchess’s pleasant brother, Prince Adolphus, is here,\r\nand his future bride, Lady Sybil Grosvenor, with Lady Grosvenor and her\r\ndaughter, also the William Lowthers and the beloved Halifax’s. With the\r\nLowthers I have been two excursions--to Swillerton, Sir C. Lowther’s\r\nrather fine house, and to the beautiful old house of Ledstone, a very\r\npicturesque place.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Ravenstone, Oct. 14._--This lovely little place of Mrs. Howard is\r\nabove Lake Bassenthwayte, not considered a beautiful lake, but\r\ninfinitely lovely at the spot to which she has taken me, through the\r\ngarden of Sir H. Vane, where a richly wooded promontory embossed upon\r\nthe still evening sky was reflected in every detail in the calm limpid\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\n“We have been for service to the most delightfully primitive little\r\nchurch--a Dalesman’s church--such as Wordsworth has described. At\r\nGreystoke we have spent a day, received by the little girl, daughter of\r\nthe house, with the manners of a princess. Little of the old castle\r\nremains.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Bishopthorpe, Oct. 16._--‘That is a portrait of Bishop Willmer of\r\nLouisiana,’ said the Archbishop, showing his study. ‘He was at one of\r\nthe conferences at Lambeth in Archbishop Tait’s time. When he went away\r\nMrs. Tait said to him, “Well, good-bye, Bishop; I hope you’ll come again\r\nat the next conference.”--“No, Mrs. Tait, neither you nor I will be at\r\nthe next conference.”--“Oh, Bishop, but I hope we shall see you\r\nagain.”--“No, Mrs. Tait,” said the Bishop very solemnly, “neither you\r\nnor I shall be at the next conference, but we shall meet again very\r\nsoon.” Three months after that--one in America, the other at\r\nEdinburgh--the Bishop and Mrs. Tait died on the very same day.\r\n\r\n“‘Bishop Willmer had the utmost simplicity of character, but he was a\r\ntrue apostle. One day, crossing a green at Boston, he found a little boy\r\nplaying pitch-and-toss. He was very fond of little boys, and he stopped\r\nand spoke to this one--spoke to him very kindly. “Now, are you a good\r\nlittle boy?” he said at length. “Well, I sometimes say cuss words,”\r\nanswered the boy. “Oh, I’m sorry for that,” said the Bishop; “but at any\r\nrate, I see you speak the truth.”--“Oh, only dogs tell lies,” said the\r\nboy. “Well, now,” said the Bishop, “would you like to do me a\r\nkindness?”--“Yes,” said the boy. “Well, I expect a parcel at the railway\r\nstation, and I want you to go for it, and bring it to a particular\r\nhouse. There will be seven dollars to pay for that parcel, and here are\r\nthe seven dollars, and there are fifty cents for yourself.” The boy took\r\nthe $7.50 and went off.\r\n\r\n“‘When the Bishop reached the house, he told what he had done, and was\r\nheartily jeered at--that he should trust a Boston waif like that. There\r\nwas a very large party, and they all went in to dinner. Before it was\r\nover, a servant came in and said that there was a boy there who wanted\r\nto speak to the Bishop. The Bishop went out, and the whole company\r\nfollowed him--they followed him into the hall, and there was the boy at\r\nthe door. He was not the least abashed, but, when he saw the Bishop,\r\nsaid, “Well, I’ve brought the parcel, but it cost seven dollars fifty\r\ncents: you did not see the fifty cents marked in the corner.”--“Well,\r\nhow did you get the parcel, then?”--” Oh, I paid the fifty cents you\r\ngave me.”--“And how did you know you’d get the fifty cents again?”--“\r\nWell, I thought as a chap as would trust me with seven dollars would\r\nnever make a trouble for fifty cents.”\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ said the Bishop, before they parted, ‘now I should like to give\r\nyou my blessing;’ and the boy knelt on the door-mat, and solemnly and\r\nepiscopally, before all the company, the Bishop gave the poor boy his\r\nblessing.’\r\n\r\n“The chapel here in the palace is thirteenth-century, and has been\r\nrestored by Archbishop Maclagan. The stained windows by Kempe are\r\nbeautiful, representing the Crucifixion, and the saints connected with\r\nYork. ‘I wished that the Saviour should be represented without any\r\nappearance of suffering,’ said the Archbishop--‘as the offering of\r\nhumanity, not the sacrifice for sin. The suffering crucifixes only grew\r\nup in mediaeval times with ideas of purgatory. The early artists wished\r\nto excite faith, not pity, and represented the Saviour’s triumph over\r\ndeath, even while enduring it. The earliest crucifix, in the Catacomb of\r\nPope Julius, given by Mrs. Jameson, but which totally disappeared a few\r\nyears since, represents on the cross a beautiful youth, draped from head\r\nto foot, and without suffering.’\r\n\r\n“I have had a delightful long drive with Augusta to Bramham. The old\r\nhouse was burnt down sixty years ago, and has never been rebuilt. But\r\nits glorious old gardens are kept up. There is nothing like them in\r\nEngland. They were laid out by Le Nôtre when he laid out Versailles, and\r\nare more like that than any other place. Eighty acres are intersected\r\nby grand avenues with immense walls of clipped beech, ending in\r\nsummer-houses, statues, vases, or tanks walled in with stone and\r\nsurrounded by statues and vases of flowers. Mr. Fox, a most grand old\r\nman, showed me everything, and talked of the change from the old times\r\nof his youth, when Yorkshire country visits were so cheery, and the\r\nchief dissipation of the county people was a ball at York. ‘Now every\r\nman with three hundred a year and a daughter thinks he must go to\r\nLondon.’ He talked of the degeneracy of Temple Newsam from the time when\r\nthree litters of cubs were regularly brought up in the woods near the\r\nhouse. His sitting-room is full of hunting pictures and caricatures of\r\nhis old friends--a great enjoyment to him.\r\n\r\n“I asked Augusta much about Mrs. (Adelaide) Sartoris, whom she had known\r\nwell. She said: ‘Edward Sartoris did not go with Adelaide when she went\r\nto Vichy. Leighton, who was always as a slave to her, went with her,\r\ntook her lodgings, and did everything for her. Then he said, “You will\r\nbe very dull, knowing no one here; I know some young men here, and I\r\nwill introduce them to you. They are Burton and Swinburne, but you know\r\none is a believer in Buddhism, the other in nothing; so you must not\r\nmind what they say.” Then Leighton left.\r\n\r\n“‘The next evening Adelaide was having her coffee in the gardens, when\r\nthe two young men came up and sat down by her. At first they made\r\nthemselves very agreeable. Then at length they began to air their\r\nopinions, and to say things evidently intended to shock. Adelaide laid\r\ndown her cup, looked at Burton, and said very slowly, “You believe, I\r\nthink, in _Juggernaut_, therefore, with regard to Juggernaut, I shall be\r\nvery careful not to hurt your feelings. And you, Mr. Swinburne (turning\r\nto him), believe, I think, in _nothing_, but if anything is mentioned in\r\nwhich you _do_ believe, I shall be very careful not to hurt your\r\nfeelings either, by abusing it: now I expect that you will show the same\r\ncourtesy to me.”\r\n\r\n“‘The young men laughed, and for some days all went well. Then the\r\nimpression passed, and one day they began to talk as before. Adelaide\r\nagain laid down her cup, and began again in the same slow tones--“You\r\nbelieve, Mr. Burton, I think, in Juggernaut”.... Then they burst out\r\nlaughing, and they always behaved themselves in future.’\r\n\r\n“‘When I was a girl,’ said Augusta, ‘I was with Mary at Madame de\r\nl’Aigle’s near Compiègne. There was to be a little function in the\r\nvillage, and some music was got up for it. We assisted at the practices,\r\nand Leighton also, who was there as a beautiful young man. But before\r\nthe day of the function came he had to go. “Oh, Fay, why should you\r\ndesert us? what can we do without our tenor?” said Madame de l’Aigle.\r\nBut she implored him in vain; he said he _must_ go. We all continued,\r\nhowever, to urge him, and at last he said, “Well, I’ll tell you what\r\nI’ll do: I must go, but I’ll come back.”--“What! all the way from\r\nLondon?” “Yes.” And he did. It was not long after that we found out why\r\nhe thought himself obliged to go: it was because the sale of the\r\npictures of that poor artist, Mason, who had died leaving his wife and\r\nchildren terribly unprovided for, was going to take place, and Leighton\r\nthought that if he were present at the sale, and seen bidding for the\r\npictures, they would fetch higher prices. It was only one of a thousand\r\nkindnesses Leighton has done.... People have sometimes called him\r\naffected, but he was not. His manners were perfectly natural: he could\r\nnot help being the spoiled darling of society.\r\n\r\n“‘George IV., as Prince Regent, was very charming when he was not drunk,\r\nbut he generally was. Do you remember how he asked Curran to dinner to\r\namuse him--only for that? Curran was up to it, and sat silent all\r\nthrough dinner. This irritated the Prince, and at last, after dinner,\r\nwhen he had had a good deal too much, he filled a glass with wine and\r\nthrew it in Curran’s face, with “Say something funny, can’t you!”\r\nCurran, without moving a muscle, threw his own glass of wine in his\r\nneighbour’s face, saying, “Pass his Royal Highness’s joke.”\r\n\r\n“‘That story reminds me of the old Queen of Sweden. She was furious at\r\nthe appointment of Bernadotte, and would have nothing to do with him; at\r\nwhich people congratulated him rather, because if she had seen him, they\r\nsaid, she would certainly have killed him. But at last she seemed to get\r\ntired of her estrangement, and she invited Bernadotte to a banquet. He\r\nwas delighted--so glad to be friends; but as he was going to her palace,\r\na paper was put into his hands inscribed--by whom he never knew--with\r\nthe words, “If she offers you food or drink, as you value your life,\r\nrefuse it.” He arrived, and the Queen was most affable, courtesy and\r\nkindness itself. After dinner a cup of coffee was brought on a golden\r\nsalver, and, with the most exquisite grace, the Queen offered it to\r\nBernadotte. He was just about to drink it when he remembered the\r\nwarning, and he returned it to her, saying, “Après vous, Madame.” The\r\nQueen turned deadly pale, looked him full in the face, and--drank it.\r\nNext day Stockholm was agitated by terrible news. The Queen-Dowager had\r\ndied in the night.’\r\n\r\n“The dining-room here is hung with Archbishops, a very fine set of\r\nportraits. Sir Joshua painted Archbishop Harcourt, and came down with\r\nthe picture to Bishopthorpe. At dinner, the chaplain, who was afterwards\r\nArchbishop Markham, said, ‘Who is the fellow who has painted that vile\r\npicture of the Archbishop?’--‘The fellow is me,’ said Sir Joshua, who\r\nwas sitting by him; but he was so struck by what Markham said that he\r\ninsisted on taking the picture back with him to London, and repainted it\r\nas it is now. Talking of the portraits led to Sir T. Lawrence, who was\r\nan endless time over his pictures. That was the case with his portrait\r\nof Lady Mexborough and her child. Lord Mexborough asked to have it home\r\nagain and again, but it was no use. At last he said he _must_ have the\r\npicture. ‘Well,’ said Sir Thomas, ‘I’ve been a long time, I allow; but\r\nI’ve got well forward with Lady Mexborough: it’s the baby wants\r\nfinishing. Now if Lady Mexborough would kindly bring the baby and give\r\nme another sitting, I really will finish.’--‘Well, Sir Thomas,’ said\r\nLord Mexborough, ‘my wife will be happy to give you another sitting\r\nwhenever you like, but _the baby’s in the Guards_!’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Lincoln, Oct. 18._--Between York and this, I turned aside to visit\r\nHowden, a most grand church. In the vicarage garden I saw an old lady\r\nfeeding chickens, and I could not help going up to her and saying, ‘Were\r\nyou not once a Miss Dixon?’ She was so exactly like her sister, who was\r\nwith Miss Dixon, the miniature-painter, at the little Holmhurst hospice\r\nlast year. Her husband, Mr. Hutchinson, showed me all the relics, the\r\nremains of the shrine of S. John of Howden, bearing a statue of the\r\nVirgin with the dove whispering into her ear, as S. Gregory is so often\r\nrepresented at Rome: the Saltmarshe Chapel, with its old tombs and its\r\nstone altar with five crosses: and the lovely ruined choir, with\r\nexquisite chantry chapels opening from it. Then, in the vicarage garden,\r\nare remains of an old palace of the Bishops of Durham, with a beautiful\r\nold gateway.\r\n\r\n“I also saw Selby, a very fine church with a Norman nave, but less\r\ninteresting than Howden.\r\n\r\n“Lincoln is altogether delightful, with its crown of yellow-grey towers\r\nrising high above the red roofs of the town. And it is most pleasant in\r\nstaying with the beloved Precentor Venables to go back into the old\r\nHurstmonceaux days, which he, and almost no one else, remembers, even\r\nthough I could not join in his loyal reverence for Uncle Julius, when it\r\nwas extended to Aunt Esther also. Time seems to have stood still with\r\nhim and Mrs. Venables more than with any one I know, and it is difficult\r\nto believe that it is more than half a century since they came to\r\nHurstmonceaux as bride and bridegroom--half a century of such entirely\r\nhappy married life, that one cannot contemplate one surviving the\r\nother.[528]\r\n\r\n“We visited the delightful and beautiful old Bishop King, who now has\r\nfitted up the ruins of the old palace, and lives appropriately in the\r\nheart of the cathedral society--‘very rightly placed,’ he says, ‘below\r\nthe church, and far above the world.’ He has an expression of gentle\r\nbenignity which I never saw equalled except by Pius IX., and a manner in\r\nwhich the greatest dignity of office and the most perfect personal\r\nhumility are marvellously blended. He was sitting in what I thought was\r\na purple dressing-gown, but was told it was a cassock: a jewelled cross\r\nwas on his breast. I hoped to have seen him mitred in the cathedral, but\r\nhe only appears thus on great festivals. He talked of the Church in\r\nFrance, and I urged him to visit Ars and enjoy its atmosphere of\r\nspiritual love and blessing: he said he should go there. We also visited\r\nDean Wickham and his delightful wife, who is Gladstone’s daughter,\r\nthinking her father’s principles always right, but so full of goodness,\r\ngentleness, and beneficence herself, that it is impossible to connect\r\nher with his practice.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 16._--At Letton, the pleasant house of the Gurdons in Suffolk, I\r\nhave met a large party, including the Hamonds of Westacre, into whose\r\ncourtyard an invisible horse and rider clatter whenever any death is\r\nabout to occur in their family. I have been taken to see Hingham, where\r\nthe church contains the very fine tomb of Thomas, Lord Morley, of 1435.\r\nAnother day we went to Dereham. S. Werburga was the great saint of the\r\nplace, and was stolen by the Abbot of Ely, that her body might be\r\nvenerated there with her two sainted sisters. By her empty grave a\r\nmiraculous spring gushed forth to console the people of Dereham. So many\r\nchildren died from being bathed in it, that it is now shut off by a\r\nrailing. In the church is the feeble monument of Cowper and Mrs. Unwin.\r\n\r\n“Several curious stories were told:--\r\n\r\n“Some young men once determined to frighten the famous naturalist\r\nCuvier. One of them got horns, hoofs, and a tail, and appeared by\r\nCuvier’s bedside. ‘I am the devil,’ he said, ‘and I am come to eat you.’\r\nCuvier looked at him. ‘Carnivorous! horns--hoofs--impossible!\r\nGood-night;’ and he turned over and went to sleep.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Hall Dare had told of a young girl friend of hers. She was with a\r\nnumber of other girls, foolish and frivolous, who went to consult an old\r\nwoman who had the reputation of being a witch, and who was supposed to\r\nhave the power of making them see their future husbands. She said they\r\nmust say their prayers backwards, perform certain incantations with\r\nwater, lock their doors when they went to bed, and then they would see\r\nwhom they were to marry, but they would find their doors locked in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n“The girl followed all the witch’s directions. Then she locked her\r\ndoor, went to bed, and waited. Gradually, by the firelight, a young man\r\nseemed to come in--to come straight through the locked door--a young man\r\nin uniform; she saw him distinctly.\r\n\r\n“He went to the end of the room and returned. As he passed the bed his\r\nsword caught in the curtain and fell upon the floor. Then he seemed to\r\npass out. The girl fainted.\r\n\r\n“In the morning at first she thought it was a dream, but there, though\r\nher door was still locked, lay the actual sword upon the floor! Greatly\r\naghast, she told no one, but put it away and kept it hidden. It was a\r\nterrible possession to her.\r\n\r\n“The following year, at a country-house, she met the very young man she\r\nhad seen. They fell violently in love and were married. For one year\r\nthey were intensely--perfectly--happy.\r\n\r\n“Then her husband’s regiment had to change its quarters. As she was\r\npacking up, with horror which was an instinct, she came upon the sword\r\nput away among her things. Just then, before she could hide it, her\r\nhusband came in. He saw the sword, turned deadly pale, and in a stern\r\nvoice said, ‘How did you come by that?’ She confessed the whole truth.\r\n\r\n“He was rigid. He said, ‘I can never forgive it; I can never see you\r\nagain;’ and nothing she could say or do could move him. ‘Do you know\r\nwhere I passed that terrible night?’ he said; ‘I passed it _in hell_!’\r\nHe has given up three-quarters of his income to her, but she has never\r\nseen him since.\r\n\r\n“A Miss Broke, a niece of our host, told me even a more curious story.\r\n\r\n“A few years ago there was a lady living in Ireland--a Mrs.\r\nButler--clever, handsome, popular, prosperous, and perfectly happy. One\r\nmorning she said to her husband, and to any one who was staying there,\r\n‘Last night I had the most wonderful night. I seemed to be spending\r\nhours in the most delightful place, in the most enchanting house I ever\r\nsaw--not large, you know, but just the sort of house one might live in\r\none’s-self, and oh! so perfectly, so deliciously comfortable. Then there\r\nwas the loveliest conservatory, and the garden was so enchanting! I\r\nwonder if anything half so perfect can really exist.’\r\n\r\n“And the next morning she said, ‘Well, I have been to my house again. I\r\nmust have been there for hours. I sat in the library: I walked on the\r\nterrace; I examined all the bedrooms: and it is simply the most perfect\r\nhouse in the world.’ So it grew to be quite a joke in the family. People\r\nwould ask Mrs. Butler in the morning if she had been to her house in the\r\nnight, and often she had, and always with more intense enjoyment. She\r\nwould say, ‘I count the hours till bedtime, that I may get back to my\r\nhouse!’ Then gradually the current of outside life flowed in, and gave a\r\nturn to their thoughts: the house ceased to be talked about.\r\n\r\n“Two years ago the Butlers grew very weary of their life in Ireland. The\r\ndistrict was wild and disturbed. The people were insolent and\r\nungrateful. At last they said, ‘We are well off, we have no children,\r\nthere’s no reason why we should put up with this, and we’ll go and live\r\naltogether in England.’\r\n\r\n“So they came to London, and sent for all the house-agents’ lists of\r\nplaces within forty miles of London, and many were the places they went\r\nto see. At last they heard of a house in Hampshire. They went to it by\r\nrail; and drove from the station. As they came to the lodge, Mrs. Butler\r\nsaid, ‘Do you know, this is the lodge of my house.’ They drove down an\r\navenue--‘But this _is_ my house!’ she said.\r\n\r\n“When the housekeeper came, she said, ‘You will think it very odd, but\r\ndo you mind my showing _you_ the house: that passage leads to the\r\nlibrary, and through that there is a conservatory, and then through a\r\nwindow you enter the drawing-room,’ &c., and it was all so. At last, in\r\nan upstairs passage, they came upon a baize door. Mrs. Butler, for the\r\nfirst time, looked puzzled. ‘But that door is not in my house,’ she\r\nsaid. ‘I don’t understand about your house, ma’am,’ said the\r\nhousekeeper, ‘but that door has only been there six weeks.’\r\n\r\n“Well, the house was for sale, and the price asked was very small, and\r\nthey decided at once to buy it. But when it was bought and paid for, the\r\nprice had been so extraordinarily small, that they could not help a\r\nmisgiving that there must be something wrong with the place. So they\r\nwent to the agent of the people who had sold it and said, ‘Well, now the\r\npurchase is made and the deeds are signed, _will_ you mind telling us\r\nwhy the price asked was so small?’\r\n\r\n“The agent had started violently when they came in, but recovered\r\nhimself. Then he said to Mrs. Butler, ‘Yes, it is quite true the matter\r\nis quite settled, so there can be no harm in telling now. The fact is\r\nthat the house has had a great reputation for being haunted; but you,\r\nmadam, need be under no apprehensions, for you are yourself the ghost!’\r\n\r\n“On the nights when Mrs. Butler had dreamt she was at her house,\r\nshe--her ‘astral body’--had been seen there.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Ashridge, Nov. 19._--I arrived here by tea-time, passing in the beech\r\nwoods Lady Lothian, who reminded me of Lady Waterford, as I saw her in\r\nher long black dress and black hat, backed by the leafless trees against\r\nthe golden sunset. Then Lady Brownlow came in, still radiant in her\r\nmarvellous Bronzino-like beauty. There is much charm too in the\r\nguests--Mrs. Dallas Yorke, with her subtle refinement, Mrs. Norman\r\nGrosvenor, the Jerseys, pleasant Jack Cator, and many others. Before\r\ndark, Lady Lothian took me to the drawing-room, built entirely from\r\ndesigns of Lord Brownlow, and thoroughly Italian in its marble pillars,\r\ngreen hangings, and many fine pictures, a Mona Lisa which disputes\r\noriginality with that at Paris, a beautiful Lo Spagna of a saint, and\r\nthe sketch for the Tintoret of the Presentation of the Virgin. The\r\ndinner was lighted from brilliant sconces on old boiserie from a Flemish\r\nsacristy. In the evening ‘Critic’ was acted as a charade, led by Lady\r\nJersey.\r\n\r\n“Breakfast was at small tables. Lord Brownlow, at ours, talked of a\r\nneighbouring house where a Lady Ferrers, a freebooter, used to steal out\r\nat night and rob the pilgrims coming from St. Albans. She had a passage\r\nfrom her room to the stables. In the morning one of the horses was often\r\nfound tired out and covered with foam: no one could tell why. At last\r\nthe poor lady was found dead on her doorstep in her suit of Lincoln\r\ngreen. She constantly haunts the place. Mr. Ady, who lives there now,\r\nmeets her on the stairs and wishes her good-night. Once, seeing her with\r\nher arms stretched out in the doorway, he called out to his wife who was\r\noutside, ‘Now we’ve caught her!’ and they rushed upon her from both\r\nsides, but caught--nothing.\r\n\r\n“Lady Brownlow came over to our table. ‘I’ve come to join in your\r\nconversation.’--‘Well, you’ve stopped it,’ said Lord B. ‘However, I\r\nbring you this story. A man in a foreign hotel took a loaded pistol to\r\nbed with him. By-and-by he saw a terrible deformed hand brandished at\r\nthe foot of the bed. “If you don’t go, I’ll fire,” he shouted. It did\r\nnot go and he fired. It was at his own foot.’\r\n\r\n“It was Sunday, but I did not go to church, and walked with Lady Lothian\r\nthrough the sunlit green glades and russet woods of autumn. The house is\r\nof immense length of frontage, and behind it rises the chapel like a\r\ngreat church. ‘Can you tell me in what part of this _village_ Lord\r\nBrownlow lives?’ asked an American when he came to Ashridge. In the\r\nevening we went to service in the chapel through the splendid\r\nconservatory, with long falling festoons of Ipomea. There was a full\r\ncongregation and singing. Two panes of Holbein glass recall that\r\nAshridge was the palace of Edward VI. and Elizabeth when young, but she\r\nhated it.\r\n\r\n“We knew what you would say if you found Lady Waterford’s drawings all\r\nlying about,’ said Lady Brownlow, ‘so we worked hard to hang them up\r\nthe day before you came.’ And they looked grand together, and such a\r\nvariety--the supreme desolation of the Hagar, the self-abandonment of\r\nthe Prodigal’s repentance, the proud Othello, the lovely springing,\r\nleaping children.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Middleton, Dec. 9._--A very agreeable visit to Lord and Lady Jersey.\r\nThe country is hideous, but the house pleasant and comfortable, and a\r\nlarge new ball-room is hung with many fine portraits--the first Duke of\r\nBuckingham by Mytens and by Van Somer; Frances, Countess of Jersey,\r\nbeloved by George IV., who was sent to meet Queen Caroline and persuaded\r\nher to eat onions--‘There is nothing the king likes so much as the smell\r\nof onions’--and Sarah, Countess of Jersey, the queen of Almack’s, a huge\r\nnoble picture by Lawrence. Joining the village church is the mortuary\r\nchapel which she built, with her tomb, a copy of the Scipio tomb at\r\nRome, and lovely medallions of her daughters, Sarah, Princess Esterhazy,\r\nand Lady Clementina Villiers. The font is said to have been that of\r\nEdward the Confessor at Islip, but is of Gothic, not Saxon date.\r\n\r\n“Conversation fell on Christine, Lady Saye and Sele, who had three\r\nhusbands. When she married the first surreptitiously, she took the bull\r\nby the horns, and said to her father at dinner, ‘Father, I’m\r\nmarried!’--‘Well, my dear, but at least wait till Thomas has left the\r\nroom.’--‘No, father, Thomas need not leave the room, for Thomas is the\r\nman I’ve married.’”\r\n\r\nMy home life this year was very quiet and uneventful, only marked by my\r\nbooks. The Edgeworth family had placed Maria Edgeworth’s letters in the\r\nhands of Lionel Holland, now a publisher, and desired him to find an\r\neditor. He asked me to accept the office--certainly not a remunerative\r\none, as I only received fifty pounds for it, the whole large profits of\r\nthe book falling to the publishers. I demurred at first, but eventually\r\nundertook it, and became interested in the work, and the simple,\r\nhigh-toned, unselfish character of the lady whose letters I was\r\nselecting; and the book at once became popular, and had a very large\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nBut “The Life and Letters of Maria Edgeworth” was rather a by-play. Most\r\nof my time was given to “The Gurneys of Earlham,” which gave me plenty\r\nof very hard and anxious work. I could not help feeling, as I attacked\r\nthe mines and mountains of self-introspection in the form of religious\r\njournals which each one of the Gurney brothers and sisters left behind\r\nthem, how unsuited I was for the task, how little I could enter into\r\ntheir feelings. Indeed Catherine Vaughan had written to me--“You are\r\nunworthy even to unfasten the shoe-latchets of those saints,” and I\r\nquite agreed with her. Still, into the beauty of their _actions_, of\r\ntheir devoted and unselfish lives, I could fully enter, and when the\r\npeculiar shibboleth of those times is sifted from their words, they said\r\na great deal that was most beautiful and touching. The work has brought\r\nme into contact with many good people. And the Gurneys are still, as\r\nthey were in the early days of Earlham, most liberal to all who do not\r\nagree with them, if only they are trying to follow the same Lord and\r\nSaviour--the dearest friend of the Gurneys of old time, and I think of\r\nmost of those of present date.\r\n\r\nAt Christmas I was with the Halifaxes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ W. H. MILLIGAN.\r\n\r\n“_Hickleton, Dec. 28, 1894._--Can it be I? I say to myself, when I am\r\ncalled in pitch darkness in these winter mornings, and hurry in the dawn\r\nthrough the still dark shrubberies to the brilliantly lighted church,\r\nwhere, amid clouds of incense and the chanted salutation of the Blessed\r\nSacrament, I receive ‘the mass,’ kneeling under the shadow of a great\r\ncrucifix. Then, after breakfast, there is matins, what we should call\r\nearly morning service, at which there are few worshippers; but when it\r\nis over, and you think you are going away, not a bit of it; there is a\r\nsound like the sea rushing in, and instantly the church is\r\nfilled--thronged with people--and these come, not to receive the\r\nSacrament, but to adore it! Charlie Halifax says, ‘How strangely things\r\ncome round. My uncle, a lawyer--who had his home here with my father and\r\nmother, and died when I was five years old--used to be a great friend of\r\nNewman and Lord Devon, and others who thought as they did, and his\r\nbeautiful spiritual letters and his religious sonnets remain to us. He\r\nlonged for what he thought was the impossible; he longed to have it\r\nhere, and now here it is. At that time there was only celebration here\r\nfour times in a year; he never hoped it could be otherwise, and yet what\r\nhe so longed for--what I, too, so longed for as a boy--has been all\r\nrealised.\r\n\r\n“‘Do you know that when Miss Margot Tennant (Mrs. Asquith) said to\r\nJowett, “What do you _really_ think of God?” he said nothing for a\r\nmoment, and then answered, “I think all that signifies is what God\r\nreally thinks of me.”’\r\n\r\n“I have had many delightful talks with Charlie. When I am with him I\r\nfeel imperceptibly lifted heavenwards. I do not agree with him in\r\neverything, but oh! I _love_ him always. With him, as indeed with every\r\none else, even where I most disagree, I am careful never to speak\r\nslightingly of anything he holds sacred. If it made any difference at\r\nall, it would only cause him to hold the cloak tighter.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Hatfield, Jan. 30._--After a visit to Lord and Lady Knightley at\r\nFawsley, in bitter cold and snow, I came here to meet a huge\r\nparty--Cadogans, Iveaghs, Hampdens, and very many others. Most of the\r\ncompany have skated in the morning, but I have thoroughly enjoyed the\r\nequably warm passages and rooms of this immense house. Arthur Balfour is\r\nhere, with charming manners, quite unspoilt. He stays in his room and\r\ndoes not appear till luncheon-time, so getting many quiet hours for\r\nwork. Lord Warkworth was here for one night, a most promising youth, who\r\nbreaks the silence of the Percies. Lord Rowton also is here, and most\r\nagreeable in his natural ripple of pleasant talk. He says that he once\r\nasked Disraeli what was the most remarkable, the most self-sustained and\r\npowerful sentence he knew. Dizzy paused for a moment, and then said,\r\n‘Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.’\r\n\r\n“Disraeli used to say that, _apropos_ of history, he should always\r\nremember going to a breakfast at Lord Houghton’s, and, as the door\r\nopened, hearing the loud voice of Bunsen exclaim, ‘Modern history! why,\r\nmodern history begins with Abraham!’\r\n\r\n“He described how the Duke of Wellington would always arrange everything\r\nfor a battle--he did before Waterloo--and then would sleep soundly for\r\nan hour. ‘How could you sleep so soundly?’--‘Why, I had arranged\r\neverything.’\r\n\r\n“Lady Salisbury said that her _masseuse_ went constantly to the Queen.\r\nShe told Lady Salisbury that what appeared to be lameness in the Queen\r\nwas merely that her feet were too small to support the weight of her\r\nbody. Her hands are those of a little child.\r\n\r\n“She gave the most graphic description of an awful storm she encountered\r\nin going to S. Tropez. ‘The rivers, you know, generally flow into the\r\nsea, but then the sea flowed into the rivers: it was such a reversion\r\nof things.’\r\n\r\n“Describing his great-grandfather, Lord Salisbury said he swore so\r\nhorribly that he used to be called ‘Blastus, the king’s chamberlain.’\r\n\r\n“I said how one of the things I most wished to see, Lady Anne\r\nGrimston’s[529] tomb, was in Hertfordshire. ‘Oh,’ said Lady Salisbury,\r\n‘I will drive you there in my sledge;’ and so she did, across the\r\nsnow-laden roads. It is the most extraordinary sight. Lady Anne Grimston\r\nwas a sceptic, and when she lay upon her deathbed in 1717, her family\r\nwere most anxious to make her believe in a future state, but she\r\nwouldn’t. ‘It is as likely,’ she said, ‘that I should rise again as that\r\na tree should grow out of my body when I’m dead.’\r\n\r\n“Lady Anne Grimston died, and was buried in Tewin churchyard, and over\r\nher grave was placed a great altar-tomb, with a huge massive stone slab\r\non the top of it. In a year or two, this slab showed signs of internal\r\ncombustion, and out of the middle of it--out of the very middle of\r\nit--grew a tree (some say six different trees, but one could not see in\r\nwinter), and increased, till, in the time which has elapsed, it has\r\nbecome one of the largest trees in Hertfordshire. Not only that, but the\r\nbranches of the tree have writhed about the tomb like the feelers of an\r\noctopus, have seized it, and lifted it into the air, so that the very\r\nbase of the tomb is high up now, one with the tree or trees, so are\r\nthey welded together. Then a railing was put round the tomb, and the\r\ntree has seized upon it in the same way, has twisted the strong iron\r\nrails like pack-thread, and they are to be seen tangled and twirled high\r\nin the branches of the tree. Another railing has now been put, and the\r\ntree will behave to it just as before.\r\n\r\n“If this tree were abroad, it would become the most popular place of\r\npilgrimage in the world. As it is, thousands visit it--even across the\r\nsnow a regular path was worn to it. Tewin churchyard preaches more\r\nsermons than a thousand clergymen.\r\n\r\n“‘I have brought back Mr. Hare a most firm believer in a future state,’\r\nsaid Lady Salisbury as we re-entered the Golden Gallery at Hatfield,\r\nwhere all the guests were sitting.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_London, Feb. 2._--I dined with my two friends, Lewis Gilbertson and\r\nFrank Cookson, who live so happily together in the charming little\r\ncanonical house of the former in Amen Court. Gilbertson told me how Mr.\r\nSpooner of Oxford, celebrated for his absence of mind, was one evening\r\nfound wandering disconsolately about the streets of Greenwich. ‘I’ve\r\nbeen here hours,’ he said. ‘I had an important appointment to meet some\r\none at “The Dull Man, Greenwich,” and I can’t find it anywhere; and the\r\nodd thing is no one seems to have heard of it.’ Late at night he went\r\nback to Oxford. ‘You idiot!’ exclaimed his wife; ‘why, it was the Green\r\nMan, Dulwich, you had to go to.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ HERBERT VAUGHAN OF LLANGOEDMORE.\r\n\r\n“_April 21._--My visit at Elton has been most pleasant, Lord and Lady\r\nCarysfort so kind, the house a climax of comfort, and the party one of\r\nold friends, Knightleys, Peels, Lady Tollemache, and beautiful Lady\r\nClaude Hamilton the elder. Then the gardens and groves are quite\r\nbeautiful, especially at this time--\r\n\r\n    ‘When daisies pied and violets blue,\r\n       And lady-smocks all silver white,\r\n     And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue\r\n       Do paint the meadows with delight.’[530]\r\n\r\nBut what I really cared for most was that I accomplished my\r\nlong-wished-for pilgrimage to Little Gidding.\r\n\r\n“It is a most attractive spot, a bosky hollow in the uplands, with a\r\npool and an oak-wood. The monastic house is gone, but probably stood\r\nwhere a farmhouse stands now, and whence the raised path which led to\r\nthe still existing chapel is yet visible in the turf. An ancient\r\nbox-tree with a stem like an oak, contemporary with the old house,\r\nstands on the grass. An old contemporary book in the library at Elton\r\nhad made me even more familiar than ‘John Inglesant’ had done with\r\nNicholas Ferrar, his sister--‘a tall ancient gentlewoman about eighty\r\nyears of age, she being matron of the house’--and with Mrs. Collet and\r\nher sixteen children, including the seven sisters named after the\r\nChristian virtues--the Patient, the Cheerful, the Affectionate, the\r\nSubmiss, the Moderate, and the Charitable--who spent their home hours in\r\nmaking such wonderful books of Christian Harmonies.\r\n\r\n“To me the chapel was of most touching interest, backed by the\r\noak-wood--‘the fine grove and sweet walks’ which the little book\r\ndescribes. A broad paved path leads to the door, but in the midst of the\r\npath rises a high grey altar-tomb--Nicholas Ferrar’s, I suppose--and on\r\nits paving-stones are inscriptions over graves, in which you may still\r\nmake out the oft-repeated names of Ferrar and Collet. Inside, the chapel\r\nis lined by stalls of Charles I. date, with round-headed canopies and\r\ndivided by oak pillars. Below is the open space where the sisterhood,\r\nwho kept the six canonical hours, ‘prayed publicly three times a day\r\nafter the order of the Booke of Common Prayer,’ and where the writer of\r\nmy little book himself saw ‘the mother-matron with all her traine, which\r\nwere her daughters and daughters’ daughters, who, with four sonnes,\r\nkneeled all the while in the body of the half-space, all being in black\r\ngownes and round Monmouth capps, save one of the daughters, who was in a\r\nfriar’s grey gowne.’ There are brasses on one side of the chancel arch\r\nto John Ferrar, 1637, and John Ferrar, 1719; and on the other side to\r\nSusanna Collet, daughter of Nicholas Ferrar, who ‘had eight sons and\r\neight daughters, and who died at the age of 76;’ below this is a brass\r\nto ‘Amy, wife of John Ferrar, 1702.’ And within is the chancel, where,\r\nwith the sacrament, Inglesant received stillness and peace unspeakable,\r\nand life and light and sweetness filled his mind; where in the misty\r\nautumn sunlight and the sweeping autumn wind, heaven itself seemed to\r\nhave opened to him.’\r\n\r\n“There were many minor relics of those who did not wish it, but were\r\ncalled ‘the Nuns of Gidding’--an embossed book-cover of their\r\ngold-thread work, and tapestry cases to hold the sacred books; and in\r\nthe farmhouse some old church plate, given to Nicholas Ferrar, and a\r\nchalice inscribed ‘What Sir Edmund Sandys bequeathed to the remembrance\r\nof friendship, his friende hath consecrated to the honour of God’s\r\nservice,’ and on the handle--‘For the church of Little Gidding of\r\nHuntington Shire.’\r\n\r\n“The owner of the property came to dinner at Elton, and told me that\r\nCharles Fitzwilliam, Lord Fitzwilliam’s brother, was lost many years ago\r\nin the wilds of America. When at the very last gasp, he saw the lights\r\nof a farmhouse, to which he made his way. The woman of the house\r\nreceived him most kindly, warmed and dried him, and made him some tea.\r\n‘It will do you good; it’s Gidding tea: I had it over from\r\nGidding.’--‘What! Gidding in Huntingdonshire.’--‘Yes.’--‘Why, that’s\r\nwhere I come from: I’m a Fitzwilliam!’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ W. H. MILLIGAN.\r\n\r\n“_July 20, 1895._--I have come away from London because all that was\r\ninteresting in the season seemed to be at an end; but I enjoyed it to\r\nthe last, though certainly what I find to delight in would not please\r\nmany others. Most of all I have liked my quiet writing-table at the\r\nAthenæum, and the silence, not the society, of the club, where no one,\r\nexcept Lord Acton and myself, seems to work in the mornings. Then, after\r\ntwo o’clock, I never go back, but see people for the rest of the day.\r\nThe garden-parties make this delightful, and I had charming afternoons\r\nat Osterley, at Roehampton, and at Sion, where the brilliant groups of\r\npeople are so picturesque under the great cedar-trees. It was a great\r\npleasure once more, to be welcomed to Holland House, and to find how\r\nmuch those who possess it appreciate its great interest and charm. Once\r\na week the writing-time was broken into, and I went with drawing-parties\r\nto the garden at Lambeth, to Waltham Abbey, and to the roof of the\r\nRecord Office, whence we tried to paint St. Paul’s and all the satellite\r\nCity churches reared up against an opal sky. In the evenings there was\r\nless of interest, and a great party at Devonshire House left more to\r\nrecollect than the daily dinners, with little real conversation. I think\r\nit is Bacon who says, ‘A crowd is not company, and faces are but a\r\ngallery of pictures, and talk but a tinkling cymbal, where there is not\r\nlove.’ The last day, however, a dinner at Lady Audrey Buller’s was most\r\npleasant. It was in honour of her cousin Captain Townshend, the hero of\r\nChitral, who gave me a most graphic description of lying all day smoking\r\nbehind a barrier of earth, with a spyhole through which he could fire at\r\nany man who showed himself, hearing the thud of the return shot against\r\nhis barrier afterwards. Returning to England, he was shocked to find no\r\none but boys at the balls--‘boys who shake hands with a movement like\r\nthat of kangaroos.’ I sat by ---- the widow of the historian, who talked\r\nof other historians, especially of Mr. Freeman--how he had the head of a\r\nJupiter on the body of a gorilla: how he did not eat, but devour; it was\r\nno use to put anything less than a joint before him: how scenery never\r\ngave him the power of realising an event which he could not read of. One\r\nday at dinner Mr. Parker was within one of him. To him Freeman talked\r\nincessantly across the lady who was next him. At last there was a pause.\r\nThe lady thought she would have her innings. ‘It has been very hot\r\nweather lately, Mr. Freeman,’ she said. ‘Stuff and nonsense,’ said\r\nFreeman. ‘Parker, you were saying,’ &c. His biographer misses all his\r\ncharacteristics, but errs most in speaking of him as a typical Teuton,\r\nwhen he was undoubtedly a typical Celt.\r\n\r\n“I grumbled very much at being engaged to spend a Sunday in the country\r\nduring my London time, but never enjoyed a visit more than that to Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Tower at the Weald, in Essex. It is only seventeen miles from\r\nLondon, but wild and most beautiful, with glorious trees, a delightful\r\nold house, and a still more delightful walled garden, with the curious\r\nbrick chapel of Mary I., a long tank, and an acre of splendid roses. We\r\nate rather too much and long, but the company was charming. I went and\r\ncame back with young Lord Abinger, whom I like particularly.\r\n\r\n‘How delightful the elections are, and the blatant, self-seeking\r\nhypocritical Radicals getting the worst of it. Do you know Luttrell’s\r\nlines?--\r\n\r\n    ‘Oh, that there might in England be\r\n      A duty on Hypocrisy,\r\n     A tax on humbug, an excise\r\n     On solemn plausibilities.”’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ VISCOUNT HALIFAX.\r\n\r\n“_Penrhyn Castle, Sept. 22, 1895._--I left home in the case of one\r\n\r\n    ‘Chi per lungo silenzio parea fioco,’[531]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STOKESAY.]\r\n\r\nand have much enjoyed my holiday talking-time. How many delightful\r\npeople there are in the world. I so seldom see any one I cannot care in\r\nthe least about. One side, one aspect, seems unprepossessing, but then,\r\nif one takes the trouble to go round on the other side, one is sure to\r\nfind something. Was it not Socrates who said, ‘It is impossible to lead\r\na quiet life, for that would be to disobey the Deity.’ And I am sure no\r\none can carry their eyes about with them through a variety of people as\r\nI do, without learning fresh lessons of compensating qualities to be\r\ntraced in most, and the uniform case of all in the fight to be fought,\r\nhowever different the enemies with which each has to contend. I saw no\r\nend of people in Shropshire when I was at Buntingsdale--so familiar in\r\nmy long-ago--for Gertrude Percy’s wedding at Hodnet. After that I was\r\nin quieter scenes, but oh! how lovely, on Wenlock Edge, that\r\neighteen-mile long strip of craggy wooded hill which stretches from\r\nWenlock to Craven Arms, with such fine views over the rich plain below.\r\nWenlock Abbey I saw the evening I arrived, with its grand ruin, and the\r\ncurious cloistered abbot’s house, so well restored as a residence by the\r\nMilnes-Gaskells. Lutwyche, which Lord and Lady Chetwynd have hired, is a\r\ncharming old house in the very centre of all the beauty, and each day we\r\nwent to some wonderful old grange, manor, or mansion--Langley, Shipton,\r\nStokesay, Wilderhope, but I think you would have liked best of all\r\nPitchford, the gem of old black and white houses, though you would not\r\nhave enjoyed as I did the untouched pews of the church, where there is a\r\ngigantic oaken effigy of a thirteenth-century De Pitchford. At Condover\r\nwe saw Miss Mary Cholmondeley the authoress,[532] who looks a genius,\r\nwhich most authoresses I have met do not. Even in conversation, ‘les\r\ngens d’esprit sont bêtes’ is usually as true as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PITCHFORD.]\r\n\r\n“Penrhyn Castle has been delightful, and my room, with its exquisite\r\nviews over sea and mountains, the most delightful thing in it. Lady\r\nPenrhyn presides over the great place with the calm of perpetual\r\nmoonlight: sunlight is left to her beautiful and impulsive\r\nstep-daughter Miss Alice (Pennant), who orders out no end of carriages\r\nto take guests up into the hills or wherever they want to go. And of\r\ncourse I longed to go to Ogwen Bank and Capel Curig, connected with my\r\nmother’s childhood, and more than ever admired these rude savage purple\r\nmountains, which have so much individual character that height is quite\r\na secondary consideration. Then yesterday we went to that island in the\r\nMenai Straits, where there is an old chapel of great sanctity, to which\r\nWelsh funerals still wind along a narrow causeway, singing their\r\nbeautiful hymns as they go.\r\n\r\n“Do you know that ‘The Gurneys of Earlham’ is out? You will not like it,\r\nI think, and indeed I feel myself, that Carlyle would be justified in\r\nsaying it was ‘a very superfluous book.’ Still, I will anticipate your\r\nasking me, and tell you that, up to its lights, it is not a bad piece of\r\nwork. The whole family are a singular instance of unity without\r\nuniformity. While I have worked at the book, I have become irresistibly\r\nand most strongly attracted by such characters as Catherine Gurney and\r\nRichenda Cunningham, though for the great fetish of the family, the\r\nself-opinionated, self-parading, egotistical Joseph John, I never could\r\nhave any warm feeling. Yet a descendant of one of his cousins (Lady Fry)\r\nassures me that she was so distressed on hearing of his death in her\r\nchildhood, that she pulled down all the blinds of her doll’s house. So\r\nhe must have had his attractive points.\r\n\r\n“The book is certainly better reading than the earlier memoirs of those\r\nit concerns. Of those memoirs I heard an amusing story the other day.\r\nMr. Parke of Andover, a great American philosopher and thinker, at one\r\ntime quite lost the power of sleep. He said he had long tried all\r\nremedies in vain, but at last found a remedy which never failed. It was\r\nto have a book read to him, the story of a woman’s life. It always took\r\neffect at once, and soothed him into the sweetest slumbers. If he was\r\nnervous, his wife would take the book and begin--‘Elizabeth Fry was\r\nborn’--‘But,’ said Mr. Parke, ‘she has begun that book constantly for\r\ntwo years, and I have never found out where she was born yet, for with\r\nthe first words I am in dreamland.’\r\n\r\n“Here are two little stories for you. Miss R. told me how the Bishop of\r\nWinchester and the Dean of Windsor were walking together down the street\r\nof Windsor, when they saw a little boy struggling to reach a bell. ‘Why,\r\nyou’re not tall enough, my little man; let me ring the bell for you,’\r\nsaid the Bishop. ‘Yes, if you please, sir,’ said the boy modestly. So\r\nthe Bishop gave the bell a good pull. ‘Now then, sir, run like the\r\ndevil,’ shrieked the boy, as he made off as hard as he could.\r\n\r\n“Little E. L. was very naughty indeed the other day, and not only\r\nscratched her governess, but spit at her. ‘How can you have been so\r\nnaughty?’ said her mother, ‘it can only have been the devil who made you\r\ndo such a thing.’ ‘Well, perhaps it was the devil who told me to scratch\r\nher,’ replied little E----, ‘but, as for the spitting, it was entirely\r\nmy own idea.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ W. H. MILLIGAN.\r\n\r\n“_Garrowby, Yorkshire, Oct. 4._--The glorious weather which illuminated\r\nWales continued at Lyme, which was still in the full splendour of summer\r\nflowers. I drew with Lady Newton each day, one day at Prestbury, where\r\nthere is a wonderful old Norman mortuary chapel, like those in Brittany.\r\nMrs. Mitford was at Lyme, and it was a pleasure to talk with her of the\r\ndear Lady Egerton, whom we both so much appreciated, and who preserved\r\nher sunny nature to the last. ‘How sad to see you suffering so!’ said\r\nMrs. M. to her in her last terrible illness. ‘Yes,’ she said, ‘but then,\r\nyou know, I have _enjoyed every day of my life_.’ Thinking of her, it is\r\na difficult endeavour to be ‘doux envers la mort,’ as Bossuet said after\r\nHenrietta Maria’s death.\r\n\r\n“I went on to flattest Lincolnshire, to Revesby Abbey, to visit my\r\ndistant cousin, dear Edward Stanhope’s widow. It is delightful to see\r\nhow, by making the effort at once, it is no effort to her now to talk of\r\nhim, and indeed he is so often spoken of, that he seems to have a part\r\nstill in the family life, and his cheerful grave, like a little garden,\r\nunder the east window of the church which he built, has nothing sad. It\r\nis as if he had gone from this room into the next. Yet how delightful he\r\nwas, how truly lovable! I was taken, by my urgent desire, to Mavis\r\nEnderby; but it is a little inland village with an insignificant church,\r\nwhich could by no possibility have given any tidal warning; so I suppose\r\nJean Ingelow only took the name[533] because of its musical sound. On\r\nthe way we passed some grassy mounds. ‘What are those?’--‘The remains of\r\nBolingbroke--of the castle of Bolingbroke.’ How Arthur Stanley would\r\nhave loved them; yet they are amongst the things which are worth seeing\r\nbut not worth going to see. Another day we went by the remains of the\r\nold house of Eresby, which gave its name to Willoughby d’Eresby, to\r\nvisit the grand tombs of the Willoughbys at Spilsby. They are all of\r\nalabaster, the last representing a mother who died in childbirth, with\r\nthe infant which cost her life by her side in its cradle. Sir John\r\nFranklin was born at Spilsby, and he and his two brothers have monuments\r\nin the church. Their father was a small farmer close by, and when his\r\nfarm failed, he settled in the village itself, and kept its shop,\r\ngrocery on one side the door, drapery on the other. And, coming from\r\nthence, John Franklin became the most famous of those Arctic travellers\r\nwhom Wilkie Collins aptly describes as ‘the men who go nowhere and find\r\nnothing.’ In this drive we passed by Keil, where the church tower had\r\nsuddenly collapsed. ‘Well, now, how was it? was it a hurricane, or did\r\nthe soil give way, or what?’ said Mrs. Egerton to the sexton, who for a\r\nminute answered nothing, and then, ‘Well, mum, ‘twere this way; her just\r\nsquatted and settled.’\r\n\r\n“The house at Revesby was full of interesting objects. Amongst them was\r\na magnificent repeater watch which belonged to the old Lord\r\nStanhope.[534] One night, when he was out late, a man pounced upon him\r\nwith pistols and ‘Your money or your life.’ Always imperturbable, Lord\r\nStanhope replied very slowly, ‘My friend, I have no money with\r\nme.’--‘No,’ said the robber, ‘but you have your watch; I must have your\r\nwatch.’--‘My friend, this watch was given to me by one very dear to me,\r\nand I value it extremely. It is considered to be worth £100. Now, if you\r\nwill trust me, I will this evening place a hundred-pound note in the\r\nhollow of that tree.’ And the highwayman trusted him and Lord Stanhope\r\nplaced the note there.\r\n\r\n“Very many years after, Lord Stanhope was at a public dinner in London,\r\nand opposite him sat a City magnate of great wealth and influence. They\r\nconversed pleasantly. Next day Lord Stanhope received a letter from him,\r\nenclosing a hundred-pound note, and saying, ‘It was your Lordship’s kind\r\n_loan_ of that sum many years ago that started me in life, and enabled\r\nme to rise to have the honour of sitting opposite your Lordship at\r\ndinner.’\r\n\r\n“When I was a child, ‘Marmion’ made me long passionately to see Whitby,\r\nand ‘Sylvia’s Lovers’ afterwards increased the longing. Now I have been\r\nthere, and what a wonderful place it is. I think nothing on the English,\r\nor French, or Spanish, or German coasts is equal to it. The first\r\nmorning was a thick fog--a most blessed fog. I felt a presentiment of\r\nwhat would happen. I was certain where the abbey was, and through the\r\ndim streets, up the slippery steps, and between the gravestones of the\r\nchurchyard dripping with wet, I made my way to a certain field, which I\r\nwas sure was the right place, and there I waited. Soon out of the thick\r\nmists rose, bathed in sudden sunlight, the grand ruin of an abbey, all\r\nglorious in the heavens, but no earth visible. It was as the summit of\r\nMont Blanc is sometimes seen, but a New Jerusalem, in splendour beyond\r\nwords--‘And the building of the wall of it was of pure gold.’ And then\r\nsuddenly the fog came down again and it vanished, and in a few minutes,\r\nwhen the veil drew up the second time, a noble ruined abbey stood there,\r\nevery arch and pillar reflected in the waters of a lonely tarn, but it\r\nwas only the bones of the glorious vision which had been.\r\n\r\n“The old courthouse of the Cholmondeleys was the abbot’s house, and in\r\nit was ‘Lady Anne’s Chamber,’ terribly haunted. A figure used to come\r\ndown from a picture over the chimney, and was seen by many still living.\r\nClose by was a passage with an oubliette, down which ‘the nuns used to\r\nthrow their babies.’ All, except the offices, has been cleared away by\r\nSir C. Strickland, and a hideous modern house built. Down the steep way\r\nbelow the house Sir Nicholas Cholmondeley used to drive his four-in-hand\r\nfuriously.\r\n\r\n“The fog was fainter all the rest of that day, and oh! how I luxuriated\r\nin the winding ways upon the cliffs, in the dark red roofs piled one\r\nupon another, and the delicate grey distances of buildings or sea.\r\n\r\n“Here, at Garrowby, I have been very happy with the Halifaxes. I always\r\nfeel better for the life with them, and I have especially liked the\r\nspiritual part of it here, where there is no chaplain, as at Hickleton,\r\nand where the services in the beautiful little chapel are led by\r\nCharlie Halifax himself. Everybody joins, and a footman sings gloriously\r\nat the very pitch of his voice. In everything Charlie recalls to me\r\nsomething which I have read with a higher reference--‘Not by his\r\ndoctrines has Christ laid hold upon the heart of men, but by the story\r\nof his life.’[535] He has ‘under all circumstances that just admixture\r\nin the moral character of sweetness and dignity’ which Marcus Aurelius\r\nspeaks of. Unlike everything else is the simplicity and singleness of\r\nheart and purpose written so distinctly on everything he says and does.\r\nAction is easy and natural where faith is so absolute. ‘At all times a\r\nman who would do faithfully must believe firmly,’ was a saying of\r\nCarlyle. And though religion pervades everything, no house was ever so\r\ngay as that of which Charlie is master. What merriment we have had over\r\nour games in the evening: what fun over the mysterious disappearances by\r\nday into the four secret chambers which make this house so curious: what\r\nadmirably good stories have been told; and while the loss of the dear\r\nboys who are gone ever leaves a blank in the parents’ hearts, how happy\r\nlife is made for the children who remain! ‘La joie est très bonne pour\r\nla santé: ce qui est sot, c’est d’être triste’[536]--this seems to be\r\none of the minor guides of action. The place is not very interesting,\r\nbut the house delightfully full of books and pictures. In the park are\r\nAfrican cows, Japanese deer, emus, and kangaroos. Lady Ernestine\r\nEdgecumbe and Lady Beauchamp are here. It is a little society of those\r\nwho feel that ‘we may not only know the truth, but may live even in this\r\nlife in the very household and court of God.’”[537]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ GEORGE COCKERTON.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Oct. 9._--My return home was saddened by finding dear old\r\nHarriet Rogers--Lea’s niece--in a dying state at her little cottage in\r\nthe grounds. She was just able to recognise me, and whispered\r\ntouchingly, ‘I thank you! I thank you!’ As in the many other people I\r\nhave now seen enter the shadow of death, there was no fear and no joy;\r\nthe power of mental emotion seemed past. Yesterday, whilst I was with\r\nher, she died, passing the barrier quite painlessly. Yet what a change\r\nfor her! There is always something very awe-striking in it.\r\n\r\n    ‘And her smooth face sharpened slowly,’\r\n\r\nis a line of the ‘Lady of Shalott’ which Tennyson afterwards removed, as\r\ngiving too painful an image of death; but it is exactly what happens.\r\nTo-day I feel it--yes, _odd_ to see the same farm and garden life, in\r\nwhich she was interested and had a share, going on the same, and that\r\nher part in it should be so suddenly over--snapped. How she must be\r\nlonging to tell one now what she felt at that momentous moment. I am\r\nexactly like the person in ‘Hitherto’--‘I can’t get over expectin’ her\r\nto come in and talk it all over. It seems as though she couldn’t do\r\nnothin’ without tellin’ folk how!--But there, I dare say,--if ‘tain’t\r\nwicked to think of it,--it’s half over heaven by this time.’\r\n\r\n“‘Il faut mourir et rendre compte de sa vie, voilà dans toute sa\r\nsimplicité le grand enseignement de la maladie. Fais au plus tôt ce que\r\ntu as à faire; rentre dans l’ordre, songe à ton devoir; prépare-toi au\r\ndépart; voilà ce que crient la conscience et la raison.’[538]\r\n\r\n“My ‘North-Western France’ is now ready to appear. It has been an\r\nimmense labour, one compared with which ‘The Gurneys of Earlham’ is as a\r\ndrop to a river; but I have no doubt the latter will be more read, and\r\ncertainly more reviewed, for scarcely any Englishmen know enough of\r\nFrance to be critical about descriptions of it. I have another little\r\nbook ready too--‘Biographical Essays’--which is sure to meet with plenty\r\nof abuse, but does not deserve much, all the same. In it I have tried to\r\ngive such a picture of Arthur Stanley as may make people love him as a\r\nfriend, whilst they shrink from following him as a guide.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\nIN MANY PLACES\r\n\r\n     “The whole value and meaning of life lies in the single sense of\r\n     conscience--duty.”--FRANCES ANNE KEMBLE.\r\n\r\n    “Do weel and dread nought though thou be espyit;\r\n     He is little gude worth that is not envyit:\r\n     Take thou nae heed what tales man tells;\r\n     If thou would’st live undeemed, gang where nae man dwells.”\r\n         --SIR WALTER SCOTT _in Orloff Davydoff’s Album_.\r\n\r\n     “True happiness is only to be obtained by devotedness to the will\r\n     of God.

In summer, Nature itself can give sufficient\r\ncompanionship; but when earth is dead and frost-bound, the silence in\r\nthe long hours after sunset becomes almost terrible, and I increasingly\r\nfeel that late autumn and winter are the best time for visits.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ VISCOUNT HALIFAX.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Nov. 25._--I have much enjoyed a visit from Mr. and Mrs.\r\nCummings, the Americans who were so kind to us on our terrible return\r\njourney from Italy in 1860, and of whom the wife, at least, is so\r\nclever, that she is suffering--as Mrs. Kemble said once of some\r\none--from a constipation of her talents. They came here fresh from a\r\nvisit to Haworth, much impressed with its severe desolation,--‘that any\r\none should be able to have any hope, or look forward to a future life,\r\non the top of Haworth hill is nothing short of a miracle.’ They have\r\nmade a Brontë museum there now, chiefly full of Branwell’s drawings, of\r\ngreat interest, chiefly military. Did you know that Mr. Nichols hoped to\r\nhave been rector when Mr. Brontë died? But it was given by election, and\r\nhe was unpopular, and it went against him. He is still living in\r\nIreland, whither he took all the Brontë memorials he cared for. The rest\r\nwere sold by auction, and the butcher, baker, and candlestick-maker of\r\nHaworth bought them. The sexton showed Mrs. Cummings some of Charlotte’s\r\nunderclothing, delicately marked by herself with her C. B., and her\r\nwedding shoes, of some grey material to match her dress. He had often\r\nseen her and her sister come out of the house, and go through the little\r\ngate at the back to the moors, which at Haworth are grass, not heather.\r\nAfter Charlotte married, Mr. Nichols would not let her write. His mind\r\nwas of the very narrowest, and he disapproved of novels, and when she\r\nwas pent up in that solitude, and all her secret thoughts were pent up\r\ntoo, and never allowed to come out in writing, she--died.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE WALKS, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Cummings says we should not like America; ‘it is a country utterly\r\nwithout perspective; one must go up to the Indians and the Jesuit\r\nmissionaries for that.’ She has been describing Miss Louisa\r\nAlcott,[539] the well-known authoress. ‘She lived with her old father\r\nand her beautiful mother and her three sisters. They used to write\r\nlittle stories. One day her sisters said, “Louisa, you must write\r\nsomething more than these.”--“I would, but I can’t do it here,” she\r\nanswered. So the sisters clubbed their little savings together, and they\r\nsold a few things, and Louisa went to Boston. There she called upon\r\nRoberts, the publisher of all American good things, and said, “I want to\r\nwrite a story.”--“Very well,” he answered; “what kind will you\r\ntake?”--“Oh, I can’t make up anything,” said Louisa; “I can only just\r\nwrite what I know.”--“Oh, you can just write what you know,” said\r\nRoberts; “then don’t stay talking here; go away at once and begin.” So\r\nshe went and lived by herself and wrote, and in five weeks she brought\r\nhim her “Little Women.” He took it and said, “Come again to-morrow.” And\r\nwhen she went next day he said, “Well, I will take your story, and I\r\nwill offer you one of two things; either you can take two hundred\r\ndollars down for it, or you can take your chance.”--“But what would you\r\ndo if you were me?” asked Miss Alcott. Roberts said he had never been\r\nplaced in such an awkward predicament in his life, but he spoke the\r\ntruth and said, “I would take my chance.” She did, and soon after he had\r\nto pay her 10,000 dollars.[540] She wrote “Little Men” afterwards, but\r\nit did not answer as well; boys do not take books to their pillows as\r\ngirls do.’\r\n\r\n“‘I love crying,’ said Mrs. Cummings, ‘but then I must have somebody to\r\ncry to. I cried as a little girl because I thought my mother might die,\r\nbut I cried most because I thought that then I should have no one to cry\r\n_to_.’ Miss Alcott said to her, ‘My dear, I shouldn’t mind dying if it\r\nwasn’t for the funeral.’\r\n\r\n“‘Mr. Tennyson was very rude and coarse,’ said Mrs. Cummings, ‘but he\r\ndied well--reading his little book in the moonlight: he really couldn’t\r\nhave done it better.’\r\n\r\n“‘Louisa Payson, who wrote “The Pastor’s Daughter” and many other\r\nbooks,[541] would not say “thank you” when she was a little girl. Her\r\nfather, the stern minister, punished her in various ways, but it was no\r\ngood--she said she couldn’t. So at last, at five years old, he turned\r\nher out of doors late on a winter’s evening. He went to his affairs,\r\nforgot her, I suppose; but her mother was in an agony, and she prayed\r\nfor her child with all the spirit that was in her. At last she could\r\nbear it no longer, and she opened the door a little way, and then she\r\nheard a little wail of “I can’t say thank you: I can’t say thank you.”\r\nWhat was the end I do not know, but at any rate Louisa did not die, and\r\nlived to write books.’\r\n\r\n“These are some snatches from the Holmhurst tea-table.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ HERBERT VAUGHAN.\r\n\r\n“_Kingston Vicarage, Wareham, Nov. 10._--You would have liked going with\r\nus to Wool, on a ‘Tess of the D’Urbervilles’ pilgrimage, for there,\r\nrising by the reedy river-side, is the old gabled house to which Tess\r\nwas taken after her marriage. It is exactly as Hardy describes it;[542]\r\neven the plank bridge remains across which Angel carried her in his\r\nsleep to the stone coffin at Bindon Abbey. The two old pictures\r\nmentioned in the book really hang at the top of the staircase, and the\r\nlady in one of them is supposed to blow out the candle of any one who\r\nventures up the stairs after midnight. The whole country-side is full of\r\nmemories of the D’Urbervilles, and there are many still living who\r\ndepose to having met their phantom coach and four with outriders. The\r\nfamily still exists at Kingston as--Tollerfield!\r\n\r\n“We had an awful storm last night, but such hurricanes are the fashion\r\nin Purbeck. A Mr. Bellasye, returning home, met, not his\r\nbathing-machine, but his bathing-_house_ coming to meet him across the\r\nhedges and ditches. Mr. and Mrs. Wordsworth had a huge hole blown into\r\ntheir roof by one gust; but that did not much signify, as the next gust\r\nblew a haystack on to the roof and filled the hole up. All the cabbages\r\nand other vegetables in the kitchen-garden are frequently blown out of\r\nthe earth and into a heap in a corner, and on one occasion those in the\r\nrectory-garden were all blown into the church porch.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ VISCOUNT HALIFAX.\r\n\r\n“_Elvedon, Thetford, Nov. 14._--All the way back from Dorsetshire did I\r\ncome for the pleasure of meeting the Duchess of York here (at Lord and\r\nLady Iveagh’s); but that was not to be, as an impending event is\r\nconsidered too near for her to travel with safety. The Duke is here, and\r\nvery unaffected and pleasant, really a very nice prince, and quite\r\ngood-looking. He never fails to be punctual to the moment--a grand\r\nquality for a prince, and due, probably, to naval discipline. He talks a\r\ngreat deal, and talks well, but in reality princes have no chance--no\r\nchance at all--conversationally, as no one ever contradicts them,\r\nhowever much they disagree; no subjects are aired but those which they\r\nchoose for themselves, and the merest commonplaces from royal lips are\r\nlistened to as if they were oracles.\r\n\r\n“Anything more odious or annoying than being a prince certainly cannot\r\nbe imagined. Such a wearisome round of dullest duties and painful\r\n‘pleasures’ as it is their life’s-work to live in like a tread-mill.\r\nThen, every fault of manner, far more of conduct and character, is\r\ncommented, dwelt on, and exaggerated. I should be sorry for any prince,\r\nbut am really dreadfully sorry for this one, as he would have been\r\ncharming, and might have been extremely happy if the misfortune of his\r\nbirth had not condemned him to the severe and miserable existence of\r\nprincedom, in which all minor faults are uncorrected because\r\nunsuggested, though I believe such a true friend and fine character as,\r\nfor instance, Lord Carrington, would always notice any sufficiently\r\ngrave to be of consequence either to the country or the royal family.\r\n\r\n“I floated here in the luxurious saloon carriage of a special train, but\r\nfelt rather shy, because whereas all the rest of the party were on terms\r\nof christian-name intimacy, I knew none of them before except Lord\r\nRowton, who is, however, always very kind and pleasant. But I was\r\ninterested to see those who are so frequently part of the royal circle,\r\nand liked them all, especially and extremely Lord and Lady Carrington;\r\nbut then--everyone does!\r\n\r\n“I wonder if you know this house of Elvedon. It was Duleep Singh’s, and\r\nhe tried to make it like an Indian palace inside. Much of his decoration\r\nstill remains, and the delicate white stucco-work has a pretty effect\r\nwhen mingled with groups of tall palms and flowering plants. Otherwise\r\nthe house (with the kindest of hosts), is almost appallingly luxurious,\r\nsuch masses of orchids, electric light everywhere, &c. However, a\r\nset-off the other way is an electric piano, which goes on pounding away\r\nby itself with a pertinacity which is perfectly distracting. In the\r\nevenings singing men and dancing women are brought down from London, and\r\nare supposed to enliven the royal guest.\r\n\r\n“You know, probably, how this place is the most wonderful shooting in\r\nEngland. The soil is so bad that it is not worth cultivating, and\r\nagriculture has been abandoned as a bad business. Game is found to be\r\nfar more profitable. The sterile stony fields are intersected at\r\nintervals by belts of fir; the hedges, where they exist, are of Scotch\r\nfir kept low; and acres of thick broom are planted. Each day I have gone\r\nout with the luncheon party, and we have met the shooters at tents\r\npitched at different parts of the wilderness, where boarded floors are\r\nlaid down, and a luxurious banquet is prepared, with plate and flowers.\r\nThe quantity of game killed is almost incredible, and the Royal Duke\r\nshot more than any one, really, I believe, owing to his being a very\r\ngood shot, and not, as so often is the case in royal battues, from the\r\nbirds being driven his way.\r\n\r\n“A great feature of the party is Admiral Keppel, kindest, most\r\ncourteous, and most engaging of old gentlemen, so captivating that there\r\nis always a rivalry amongst the ladies as to who shall walk with him,\r\nand amongst the men to get hold of his stories. He told me of how his\r\nfather first started him on his naval career, and, while he talked it\r\nover at Holcombe, made him sit in the same chair in which he had talked\r\nthe same subject over with Nelson when he was starting _him_.\r\n\r\n“He described the prayers at Holcombe on Sunday evening in his boyhood.\r\nAfter dinner the men were allowed an hour or two over their wine. Then\r\nthe prayer-bell rang, and they all went in. Afterwards an old servant\r\nstayed to take up those who could not get up from their knees, and carry\r\nthem to bed by turns when they were too drunk to go by themselves.\r\n\r\n“He remembered Charles James Fox reeling down the corridor at Holcombe,\r\nfalling helplessly from side to side. His father followed him, and he\r\nfollowed his father, who kept exclaiming, ‘Good God! drunk! Good God!\r\ndrunk again!’ for the expression had not gone out then.\r\n\r\n“He said that the present Lord Leicester and his father had married at\r\nexactly a hundred years apart.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ W. H. MILLIGAN _and_ JOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 27, Hornby Castle, Bedale._--I came here yesterday. Several\r\npeople were in the castle omnibus when I got into it at the station, of\r\nwhom a grand lion-like old man turned out to be Mr. Bayard, the American\r\nAmbassador. It was dark when we arrived. We found the Duchess (of\r\nLeeds), tall, gracious, and most winning in manner, and indeed all the\r\nfamily, in a noble hall, coved at the top, with busts in the upper\r\nniches, like the halls of Roman palaces, and looking (by daylight) into\r\na courtyard, which is very picturesque and curious.\r\n\r\n“Lady Harewood is here, sweet-looking and very white, with a pleasant\r\ndaughter, Mr. and Lady Alice Shaw Stewart, and several young men. Mr.\r\nBayard came down to dinner much delighted with a book he had found in\r\nhis room--the ‘Life of Agrippina’--in which ‘What news from Armenia?’ is\r\nanxiously asked, showing how the same subject occupied conversation then\r\nas now, at a distance of nineteen centuries. He said, ‘When bad men\r\n_conspire_, good men ought to _confederate_.’\r\n\r\n“This morning, in the library, I had much and delightful talk with Mr.\r\nBayard. He gave an interesting account of the allotment of land in\r\nAmerica: how a reserve was left to the Indians, but they were dying out,\r\nchiefly because of their catching all the vices of Europeans, especially\r\ntheir love of alcohol. He said they were like the buffaloes. These used\r\nto come down and swoop through the country in vast herds, and devour all\r\nthe spring produce; and later, in their vast battalions they would\r\nswoop back again; but now, fettered and shut in by barriers and fences,\r\nthey pined, starved, and died; and so it was with the Indians. He\r\ndescribed how, after an unjust woman had published a libel on her\r\ncountry,[543] the greatest suffering had resulted to the slaves, who\r\nwould follow their former masters to suffering, wounds, imprisonment,\r\nand death. A Southern lady, when ‘the army of liberation’ approached,\r\nhad entrusted all her silver and jewels to her slaves, and they had\r\nbrought it all back safely after the army had passed.\r\n\r\n“He talked of the Banco di S. Giorgio at Genoa--‘one of the most\r\ninteresting buildings in the world;’ that whereas the Bank of London had\r\nlasted two centuries, that of Genoa had lasted five: that the Bank was\r\nthe greatest evidence of the philosophy of nations. No aspersion was\r\never cast upon it, and this was because those who administered it had\r\nnever derived any profit from it, only honour. An instance of its\r\nusefulness as a record-office occurred lately, when a man in America\r\noffered Mr. H. an autograph letter of Columbus. To all appearance it was\r\ngenuine, but Mr. H. asked leave, which was readily granted, to have a\r\nphotograph facsimile made of it before purchasing. In the Banco di\r\nGiorgio the original letter was found, and, when compared with the\r\nfacsimile, proved that the copy was false. This was especially\r\nfortunate, as, after Napoleon I., ‘that great collector of other\r\npeople’s property,’ took away the archives of Genoa, though most were\r\nrestored, all were not.\r\n\r\n“The library at Hornby is full of interest, but I can only remember a\r\nfifteenth-century ‘Roman de la Rose;’ a first edition of Shakspeare,\r\nwhich came to its present owners through Henrietta, Duchess of\r\nMarlborough, who inherited it from William Congreve; and a copy of\r\n‘Dionysius the Areopagite,’ by Beghir, ‘the one-eyed scribe of\r\nBrabant’--most delightful name--with notes by Dean Colet.\r\n\r\n“The Duchess has shown us the house minutely and delightfully. The\r\nfamily portraits were full of interest, beginning with that of Sir\r\nWilliam Hewitt, whose daughter married William Osborne, the apprentice\r\nwho saved her when she fell over London Bridge, and who founded the\r\nLeeds family. In a curious Hogarth of ‘The Beggar’s Opera,’ the Duke of\r\nBolton is represented watching the acting of Polly Peachum, whom he\r\nafterwards married: the picture is here because Sir Conyers d’Arcy, an\r\nancestor of the house, is also represented. Mr. Bayard was delighted to\r\nfind portraits of the wife of the seventh Duke, who was Miss Caton, one\r\nof four beautiful American sisters.[544] The Duchess was amused that I\r\nhad never heard of ‘Godolphin Arabian,’ the ancestor of a succession of\r\nfamous racehorses.[545] In one of the rooms is the miniature\r\nspinning-wheel of Madame de Pompadour; in another, a bed of such\r\nglorious embroidery that when Lady Marian Alford was here, she could not\r\nget up for looking at it.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Nov. 29._--At breakfast, at one of several little round tables, Mr.\r\nBayard talked pleasantly of a grave in the cemetery at Nuremberg. It is\r\none of Adam Kraft’s iron tombstones, and it bears no name. Affixed to it\r\nis a human skull, exquisitely modelled, with a jaw which opens and\r\nshuts. In the forehead--the bronze forehead--is a white patch of some\r\nother metal. The story is that the owner of that skull was very\r\nunhappily married. His misery drove him from home, drove him into very\r\nbad company, and he sank lower and lower. One day he suddenly died and\r\nwas buried; but soon afterwards his family began to suspect foul play,\r\nand he was exhumed. At first his body seemed to bear no witness, but\r\nthen, in his forehead, under his hair, a large nail was found, buried up\r\nto the hilt, hammered in so accurately that no blood had come. Every one\r\nbelieved that it was his wife who had done it, but it could not be\r\nbrought home to her; his associates were too bad for their evidence to\r\nbe trusted. But the model of his skull was laid upon his grave, and his\r\nwife left the place; she could not continue to exist near it.\r\n\r\n“We went to luncheon at Thorp-Perrow with Sir Frederick and Lady\r\nMilbank, who have a glorious garden. He is full of antiquarian lore and\r\ninterests, and has a precious collection of old locks and keys. She\r\nknows sixteen languages well, and is learning a seventeenth. Hungarian\r\nshe acquired for the sake of its literature. A despatch came to the\r\nForeign Office in Hungarian, and no one there could read it, but Austen\r\nLee sent it to Lady Milbank, who translated it at once. The Milbanks\r\nwere very intimate with Madame Goldschmidt, whom they lived next door\r\nto in London. One day in a church--a country church--they saw her go out\r\nof her pew and shake a woman by her shoulders. ‘What on earth had that\r\nunfortunate woman done?’ they asked when they came out. ‘Why, didn’t you\r\nhear she was singing a false second.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Hams, Birmingham, Nov. 30._--This is a large house of extreme comfort,\r\nand its owner, Lord Norton, who looks sixty, though he is eighty-two, is\r\none of the most agreeable hosts in England. Walking on the terrace this\r\nmorning, he said he ought to put up a slab to record how the whole\r\nconstitution of New Zealand was settled on that terrace: that which was\r\narranged while walking up and down there had never been altered. The\r\nview of the pretty windings of the Thame recalled the exclamation of a\r\nfamous landscape-gardener when he saw it--‘Clever!’ ‘It was not made, it\r\nis natural,’ said Lord Norton. But no, his friend could not regard it\r\nexcept from the gardening point of view, and ‘clever’ was all he could\r\nsay. The river was terribly polluted by Birmingham, and Lord Norton went\r\nto law about it. ‘Should the convenience of one man be considered before\r\nthat of millions?’ exclaimed the Birmingham advocate at the trial.\r\n‘Yes,’ shouted the opposition, ‘for the grandeur of English law is that\r\nmillions may not interfere with the comfort and well-being of a single\r\nindividual. Now the pollution is partially diverted into a sewage farm\r\nfive miles in extent.\r\n\r\n“The clergyman here has only the care of three hundred souls, so he\r\nkeeps three hundred chickens, and is often able to supplement his income\r\nby getting fifty pounds for a cock.\r\n\r\n“An oak avenue leads to the church, being a remnant probably of the\r\nForest of Arden, of which there are many traces still, but such an\r\navenue is very rare. The late storm had blown down several fine trees.\r\n‘How strange it is,’ said Lord Norton, ‘that amid the thousand--the\r\nmillion--theories that science has put forth, there should be none about\r\nthe wind: it is one of the many incidental proofs of the truths of the\r\nBible, that our Saviour saw this when he spoke of--“The wind bloweth\r\nwhere it listeth,” &c.\r\n\r\n“‘Those who say that as to religion we know nothing, do not recognise\r\nthat half religion is instinct (every one has the instinct that there is\r\na God), and the other half what Pascal calls “the submission of\r\nreason.”’\r\n\r\n“Lord Norton used to know very well Ellis the shoemaker, who devoted\r\nhimself to the reformation of boys. He said, ‘I do not take them to make\r\nshoes only; I take them to give them a conscience.’ He said, ‘Many\r\npeople say that the boys are fools, but they are philosophers. They\r\nreason at night. I overhear them; I hear them reasoning as to whether\r\nthere is a God.’ There was one boy especially who denied this, who\r\nlaughed at all who believed. One day this boy was given a parcel to take\r\nto Sir Moses Montefiore. Now the boys may steal, but however much they\r\ndo that, when they are entrusted with anything, they are most tenacious\r\nto fulfil their trust. This boy only knew of Sir Moses by his popular\r\nname of ‘the King of the Jews,’ and all day long he asked his way to\r\nhim in vain. He could not find him anywhere. Evening closed in, and he\r\nwas faint with hunger and fatigue. He was quite sinking, but at the last\r\ngasp cried, ‘O God, if there be a God, help me.’\r\n\r\n“Immediately a policeman rushed at him. ‘What have you got there, you\r\nyoung rascal? What’s in that parcel?--something you’ve been stealing, I\r\nsuppose?’--‘No, ‘taint; it’s a parcel for the King of the Jews, and I\r\ncan’t find him.’--‘Why, you young fool,’ said the policeman, shaking\r\nhim, ‘it’s Sir Moses Montefiore you mean: I can show you where to find\r\nhim.’\r\n\r\n“That night the boys were philosophising as usual, declaring that there\r\nwas no God, there couldn’t be, when the boy who had taken the parcel\r\nshouted, ‘Stop that rubbish, you fellows; there _is_ a God, and I _know_\r\nit: and as for you, you’re just as much able to judge of God as a worm\r\nis to judge of me.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 2._--A walk amidst the remnants of the Forest of Arden led to\r\nmuch talk about trees. ‘When Gladstone meets any one new,’ said Lord\r\nNorton, ‘his first thought is, “What does he know? what can I get out of\r\nhim?” When he met Lord Leigh, he had heard of Stoneleigh, that it\r\npossessed some of the finest oaks in England; so, when he sat down by\r\nhim, he began at once, “Lord Leigh, have you any theory as to the age of\r\noaks?”--“Yes, certainly I have; I possess several myself that are above\r\na thousand years old.”--“And how do you know that is so?” said\r\nGladstone. “Well,” said Lord Leigh, “I have several that are called\r\n‘Gospel Oaks,’ because the old Saxon missionaries used to preach under\r\nthem more than eight hundred years ago, and they would not be likely to\r\nchoose a young oak to preach under: we may suppose that they chose an\r\noak at least two hundred years old.”--“Well, that is a very good\r\nreason,” said Gladstone.’\r\n\r\n“Lord Norton had lately been with Gladstone to Drayton, full of Peel\r\nrelics, and with the wonderful collection of portraits which Sir Robert\r\nbrought together. All the heads of Government, from Walpole to the Peel\r\nAdministration, are represented. The pistols are preserved with which\r\nPeel intended to fight O’Connell at Calais, but O’Connell’s wife\r\nprevented it by giving notice and getting him arrested at Dover.\r\n\r\n“While talking of hunting as conducive to the manliness of Englishmen,\r\nLord Norton said, ‘When I was hunting with Charlie Newdigate, a boy\r\nalmost naked, not quite, came out of a coal-pit, and on a donkey,\r\nwithout saddle or bridle, hunted with us all day, not going over the\r\nhedges, but through them. Newdigate was delighted. “_That’s_ the stuff\r\nEnglish heroes are made of,” he said, and he had a long talk with the\r\nboy afterwards, and explained to him all about the field, &c.... In\r\nNorthumberland there was a boy who would ride one of his father’s bulls.\r\nHis father cut him off at last, and would have nothing more to do with\r\nhim. ‘I’m not a bad father,’ he said, ‘and I don’t mind his riding my\r\nbull, but when he takes him out with the hounds it’s too much.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_The Deanery, Llandaff, Dec. 7._--Lord Robert Bruce told me the facts\r\nof Lord Llanover’s ghost story. As Sir Benjamin Hall and he were riding\r\nin the Park in London, Sir Benjamin distinctly saw Lord Rivers, who was\r\nan intimate friend of his, and he _saw him vanish_. He went to his club\r\nimmediately afterwards, and told what he had seen, and before he left\r\nthe club a telegram was brought in announcing that Lord Rivers was dead.\r\nAfterwards Sir Benjamin Hall went to Mrs. Hanbury Leigh, and told her\r\nwhat had happened, adding, ‘You know this must mean something; it must\r\nmean that I am myself to die within the year;’ and so he did.\r\n\r\n“I have enjoyed being again with the cousin so deeply loved in my\r\nchildhood, and also seeing the really beautiful work of the gentle and,\r\nI am sure, holy Dean amongst the young men preparing for orders, who\r\nhover reveringly around him.’\r\n\r\n“Catherine Vaughan has told me how, after Augusta Stanley’s death, she\r\nsaid to Mrs. Drummond (of Megginch), who was living at the Deanery,\r\n‘Augusta’s presence so seems to fill this place, that I quite wonder she\r\nnever appears here;’ and was startled by the way in which Mrs. Drummond\r\nsaid, ‘_She does_.’ Augusta used on her death-bed to say to Arthur, ‘I\r\nshall always be near you when you give the Benediction.’ One day in the\r\nAbbey, between the arches, but quite near Arthur, Mrs. Drummond most\r\ndistinctly saw Augusta--a vaporous figure, wrapped in folds of vaporous\r\nwhite drapery, but with every feature as distinctly visible as in life.\r\nThis was just before the Benediction, and as its last tones died away\r\nthe appearance vanished. Mrs. Drummond had no doubt about it at all.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ GEORGE COCKERTON.\r\n\r\n“_Burwarton, Shropshire, Dec. 12._--This is a charming place in the high\r\nClee Hills, and Lord and Lady Boyne, who live in it, are quite\r\ndelightful. I have been working for a great part of several days in the\r\nlibrary at a little book on ‘Shropshire,’ which I hope to be able to\r\nfinish another year. You would have been amused by the quaint sayings of\r\nan old clergyman who came to dinner. Speaking of an unusually stupid\r\nneighbour he said, ‘His folly is incredible, but even he has his lucid\r\nintervals, for the other day he told me he knew he was an ass.’\r\n\r\n“I would give up, if I were you, taking the extra work you speak of.\r\nThere is an old Swedish proverb which says--‘You cannot get more out of\r\nan ox than beef,’ and there is no use, none, in trying to do, or to be,\r\ntwo things at once.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ VISCOUNT HALIFAX.\r\n\r\n“_Rome, April 23, 1896._--I wonder if you know that I have been abroad\r\nsince the first of February. At first, for a month, I was on ‘the\r\nRivieras,’ finishing up a little volume which will be so called, and\r\nwhich will appear before next winter. Some new places are opened up now\r\nby a railway--a most beautiful miniature railway--from Hyères to S.\r\nRaphael, and amongst them is S. Maxime, a quiet scene of tranquil\r\nbeauty, where the pension is still only six francs, in a charming little\r\nhotel with a garden which comes down to a sea-cove, where you look\r\nacross transparent shallows of emerald-green water into mountain\r\ndistances, not grand, but supremely lovely, and where, in our long-ago\r\ndays, you and I should have been in a fever of romantic interest over\r\nthe old castle of Grimaud, which was the cradle of the princely\r\nGrimaldis.\r\n\r\n“At Nice, I was not in the town, but at the old Villa Arson, which you\r\nwill remember. It is now a hotel, though its wonderful garden, full of\r\nstatues, staircases, fountains, and grottoes amongst the flowers and\r\npalm-trees, is quite untouched. It was all beautiful, and the sky was\r\ncloudlessly blue for a month; and I lingered at Bordighera with the\r\nStrathmores and my dear old friend Emilia de Bunsen, and then at Alassio\r\nwith my cousin Lady Paul, and at beautiful Rapallo. But oh! the\r\ndifference on entering real Italy, and finding oneself in the delightful\r\nold-world streets of Lucca, with their clean pavements and brown\r\ngreen-shuttered houses, with the air so much more bracing, the sky so\r\nmuch more soft, and the pleasant manner and winning tongue of the\r\nItalian people.\r\n\r\n“At the Florence station I had an unpleasant experience, in being robbed\r\nof £100 by two roughly-jostling men at the entrance of the carriage. It\r\nwas a great loss, but I could not help admiring the cleverness with\r\nwhich they contrived to extract my pocket-book out of the inner breast\r\npocket of my coat _with a greatcoat over it_. They were taken up\r\nafterwards--Frenchmen, I am glad to say, not Italians--and immense booty\r\nof watches, purses, &c., found upon them, all taken at Florence station;\r\nbut I have no chance of recovering my notes. I have had to appear\r\nagainst them already six times and to identify them in prison.\r\n\r\n“My last six weeks have been spent in Rome,--spoilt, destroyed, from\r\nthe old Rome of our many winters here, but settling down now into the\r\ninferior mediocrity to which the Sardinian occupation has reduced it.\r\nAnd, though one does not see them every hour as one used to do, there\r\nare still many lovely and attractive corners to be hunted up. The\r\nItalian archaeologists (so called) are also finding out that they have\r\nmade a great mistake in tearing away all the plants and shrubs which\r\nprotected the tops of the ruins, and are comically occupied in planting\r\nlittle roots of grass and chickweed on their barren summits. There are\r\nvery few capable or interested winter visitors now. They mostly belong\r\nto the class of the first of the three audience-seekers to whom Pius IX.\r\naddressed his usual question of ‘How long have you been in Rome, and how\r\nmuch have you seen?’ and who answered, ‘I have been here three days, and\r\nhave seen everything.’[546]\r\n\r\n“Good old Dr. Gason has died lately (the man of whom Pius IX. said--‘un\r\ncerto pagano, chi si chiama Jasone’), the leader of the Evangelical\r\nparty here--one of a class who seemed to me ‘every one’ when I was a\r\nboy, and when the dreary desert of Sunday was only enlivened by Foxe’s\r\n‘Book of Martyrs’ and ‘Josephus,’ and almost everything pleasant was a\r\n‘carnal indulgence.’ How few there are who think like that now--no one\r\nwho has a real part in my life since dear Charlotte Leycester passed\r\naway. Certainly, there is no one now to think one--well, much worse than\r\na pagan for taking one’s sketch-book on Sundays to the Palace of the\r\nCaesars, where I have spent many quiet hours meditating on my past and\r\nits past. I am often oppressed, however, by my great loneliness, by the\r\nwant of any relation who has a real interest in me, by the constant\r\nfeeling--however kind people are--of _signifying_ nothing to anybody.\r\nAnd those who remember our old life--the old life with the mother and\r\nLea which was so different from this--are becoming very, very few. I can\r\nonly try to say--\r\n\r\n    ‘Call me, silent voices,\r\n     Forward to the starry track\r\n     Glimmering in the heights beyond me,\r\n     On, and always on.’[547]\r\n\r\n“The ruin of the great families here is depressing. There has been a\r\nsale at the old historic Orsini palace, at which a marble statue holding\r\na baton behind the auctioneer seemed to repeat his action and to preside\r\ncoldly over the ruin of his house and dispersion of its treasures. And\r\non the floor of the hall, appropriately surrounded by overthrown marble\r\npedestals, lay the great bust of the Orsini Pope, with a look of\r\nunutterable disgust upon his face at having been just sold for £6. I\r\nbought a little Madonna, which will adorn Holmhurst, if I can get it out\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\n“There is a new line to Viterbo now, which brings many places, formerly\r\ndifficult of access, within easy reach. With the Gordons from Salisbury\r\nI went to Anguillara, splendid in colour from the orange roofs of its\r\nquaint houses rising high above the broad, still lake in which\r\nBracciano and other towns on the farther shore were reflected. We\r\nwandered afterwards in the beautiful gardens of an old ‘Ser Vincenzo,’\r\nwith woods--real trees--of camelias in fullest bloom, and larks singing,\r\nand carpets of violets. Then another day, a large party of us went to\r\nSegni in the purple recesses of the Volscian mountains, and saw that\r\nwonderful arch whose origin is lost in pre-historic mystery. We took our\r\nluncheon with us, and ate it on the down above the huge stones of the\r\nwall. But generally we have something odd at the village inns. ‘How I\r\nlike topographical gastronomy!’ said old Mrs. Blackburn of Moidart on\r\none of these tourettes.\r\n\r\n“Few interesting visitors have been at Rome this year, but having Lady\r\nAirlie and Lady Kenmare here has been very pleasant, and dear old Miss\r\nGarden--even in her great feebleness, which, alas! is constant\r\nnow--always ripples with wit and wisdom. At Mrs. Terry’s I met Miss\r\nPaterson, the martyr-bishop’s sister, who told me how her old father,\r\nwhen he first learnt his son’s determination to go out, began to say,\r\n‘Oh, I cannot let him go,’ and then broke in with, ‘But oh! I _cannot_\r\ndeny him to God.’ He parted with him knowing they could never meet\r\nagain, but, after a time, in his letters found interest and consolation.\r\nTo-day--a desperately wet day--has been enlivened by a summons to\r\nluncheon with the Crown Princess of Sweden, whom I think one of the most\r\ncharming, natural, and attractive of human beings; and oh! how simple,\r\nhow utterly without affectation is that sort of person who can have\r\nnothing to _pretend_ to. It is that, I suppose, which makes such people\r\nso much the easiest to talk to, which makes one feel so far more at\r\nrest with them than with persons of another, even of one’s own class.\r\nThe Princess’s health obliges her to winter in Italy, away from her\r\nhusband and her little sons, but she will hurry back to them with the\r\nwarm weather. There was no one else at luncheon but the lady and\r\ngentleman in waiting, and the conversation was chiefly about ghost\r\nstories, the Princess declaring that ‘every hair of her head had curled\r\nup’ from one I had told her at Eastbourne.\r\n\r\n“There is a sort of homely amusement in seeing--I cannot help sometimes\r\ncounting them!--the great number of people who go about here with the\r\nfamiliar little red and black volumes of ‘Walks in Rome.’ Sometimes also\r\nI am touched by a kind note from an unknown hand saying that one of my\r\nother books has been helpful to them. I am so glad when this happens. As\r\nto any other feeling about my books, I think I gradually get to\r\n_realise_ how ... ‘there is one glory of the terrestrial, another glory\r\nof the celestial,’ and how one has to keep that in one’s heart.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS GARDEN _at Rome_.\r\n\r\n“_Viterbo, May 1, 1896._--Yesterday I went to Toscanella. The landlord\r\nof the hotel was to engage a little carriage for me, which I found at\r\nthe door when I went down, but with a horse which was an absolute\r\nskeleton. Still they declared it could go, and it _could_. How it\r\nrushed, and tore, and swung us down the rose-fringed descent to the\r\ngreat Etruscan plain, where the faint dome of Montefiascone rose in the\r\nblue haze against the heavens, beyond the aërial distances of burnt\r\ngrass, broken here and there by Etruscan caves and ruins. Then how the\r\nskeleton horse still galloped into the uplands, till great towers\r\nappeared grouped like ninepins, or rather like S. Gemignano. It is yet a\r\nlong circuit to the town, a descent into a rocky gorge, then a steep\r\nascent winding round the hill outside the walls, a sort of Calvary to\r\nthis Jerusalem, where the great churches stand, S. Pietro like the most\r\nmagnificent cathedral, girdled by huge walls and towers, with a ruined\r\nepiscopal palace beside it, and a triumphal arch, like those of\r\nBrittany, in front of the east end. The church was locked and the key\r\nwas away, but a little girl snatched a sick bambino from its cradle, and\r\ncarried it, and guided me to S. Maria in the depth below--even far\r\nlovelier and more refined in the delicate sculpture of its roseate stone\r\nthan the great church above. All its great western doors were open to\r\nthe brilliant sunshine, yet it was terribly damp, the font and all the\r\nlower part of the pillars green as the grass outside. But the exquisite\r\npulpit and bishop’s throne were unhurt, and the lovely frescoes--even\r\nmore beautiful in effect than detail--with which the walls were covered.\r\nHaving secured the key, we returned to S. Pietro, entering it by the\r\ncrypt--_l’incolonnata_--a perfect maze of little columns like the mosque\r\nat Cordova in extreme miniature. Most grand is the upper church in its\r\norange-grey desolation; mass there only once a year. But our bambino was\r\nworse for the damp, so we did not stay long, and indeed it was cheering\r\nto emerge on the breezy uplands, where the whole air was embalmed with\r\nsweet-basil, as one trod it down.\r\n\r\n“The city of Toscanella scrambles, a mass of brown towers, golden roofs,\r\nand grey houses, along the opposite hill, and has a thousand corners\r\nwhich are enough to drive an artist frantic--such gothic windows; such\r\ndark entries; such arcaded streets, with glints of brilliant foliage and\r\nflowers breaking in upon their solemn shadows. At a little inn I had\r\nluncheon--a dish of poached eggs, excellent bread, cheese, and wine, and\r\nall for forty centimes, so living is not dear in Toscanella.\r\n\r\n“Then oh! how the skeleton horse galloped home under the serene\r\nloveliness of the pellucid sky, over the plain where all the little\r\ngrasses and flowers were quivering and shimmering in golden sunset\r\necstasy.\r\n\r\n“I cannot say the food here is delicious; it would be an exaggeration.\r\nAll the little somethings and nothings a butchered calf is capable of,\r\nand vegetables lost in garlic and oil. The host’s name is Zefferino; he\r\nis a very substantial zephyr. He arranged for my going this morning to\r\nS. Martino, which I was most anxious to visit, for love--or was it\r\nhate?--of Donna Olimpia Pamfili. I so longed to see where the great\r\n‘papessa’ died; and how the plague got hold of her on that most grand\r\nheight, overlooking seventy miles of pink and blue distances, one cannot\r\nimagine. Rocky honeysuckle-hung lanes lead up to it--a little\r\nbrown-walled town, with gates and fountain, and just one street--the\r\nsteepest street in the world, up which the great white oxen can only\r\njust struggle--leading up to the palace and church. Before the high\r\naltar of the latter is Olimpia’s tomb, providently placed in her\r\nlifetime, with, I thought, a rather touching inscription, saying that\r\nshe had really tried to do all the good she _could_; and in the palace\r\nare her full-length portrait and furniture of her time, and two pictures\r\nof Innocent X. The great cool halls are let in the summer months, and\r\nhave, oh! such a view from their terrace; while close behind the palace\r\nis another gate of the walled town, from which glorious forest--the\r\ngreat Ciminian oak forest--begins at once, and stretches away to\r\ninfinity. I drew there, and five little swineherds in peaked hats and\r\nabout a hundred pigs grouped themselves around me. How _human_ the\r\nlatter are! They all had names, to which, when their masters called\r\nthem, they responded from a great distance, grunting loud, and running\r\nup as hard as they could.\r\n\r\n“Then this afternoon--oh! wealthy Viterbo!--I have been again to the\r\nglorious Villa Lante. Surely never was there so beautiful a garden;\r\nnever one so poetical out of nymph-and faun-land--the green glades, the\r\nmoss-grown staircases, the fountains and vases, the foaming waterfalls,\r\nthe orange-trees and flowers!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ W. H. MILLIGAN.\r\n\r\n“_Abbazia di S. Gregorio, Venice, May 17._--On arriving here, I was\r\npersuaded to go to one of the principal hotels, sumptuously luxurious,\r\nand consequently intensely unsympathetic and unattractive. The mass of\r\nAmericans, travelling like their own trunks, and with as much\r\nunderstanding of the place, drove me away at last, and I was enchanted\r\nto find a refuge in this dear little abbey, with its venerable court\r\nfull of flowers and beautiful decorated gateway, outside which the\r\ngreen waves of the Grand Canal sparkle and dance. Walter Townley and his\r\ncharming bride have the other rooms, and we go together for our dinner\r\nto a restaurant, and close by are Lady Airlie and Lady Kenmare, and,\r\njust opposite, Basil and Lady Margaret Levett, all as perfect types of\r\nhigh-bred excellence as can be found anywhere. I have enjoyed Venice\r\nmore than any other part of this time abroad--have had very happy times\r\nwith these friends in the afternoons, and in the mornings by myself\r\ndrawing in desolate but lovely corners, unknown places, quite overlooked\r\nin what Symonds calls ‘Ruskin’s paint-box of delirious words.’ Yet I\r\nfind colouring here very difficult, and quite a new style necessary,\r\nwhere _every_ shadow is transparent. Miss Clara Montalba thoroughly\r\nunderstands this, and the delicate drawings which come from her fairy\r\nbrush have as much of the most refined poetry of the place as mine have\r\nof its most unimaginative prose. But, with the love which I suppose\r\nevery one has of seeking what is unusual, she paints rather the dull and\r\nfoggy than the bright days. From the windows of the old house in the\r\nZattere, where she lives with her mother and two sisters, she has the\r\nmost glorious subjects, in which shipping is the great feature. Her\r\nsister Hilda has also a studio in the top of the house--such a quaint\r\nand picturesque place, with two tame doves flying about in it. She\r\ndescribed an old palace in which they had lived near Vicenza, where the\r\nimmense dining-room table had a central leg, with a fireplace in it to\r\nkeep the dinner hot.\r\n\r\n“Two sets of people ought always to live in Venice: those who have heart\r\ncomplaints and those who are afraid of horses; the peaceful floating\r\ngondola life would be so suited to them. Lord Houghton’s sister, old\r\nLady Galway, spent many winters here for the former reason. But no one\r\nought to come here unless they at least _intend_ to see the best of it,\r\nand to enjoy it.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ W. H. MILLIGAN.\r\n\r\n“_August 1, 1896._--I have enjoyed my six weeks in London with their\r\nmuch people-seeing. People laugh at me for liking it all so much, and\r\nstill more for expressing my liking for it; but I believe I shall never\r\nturn out to be ‘one of those whom Dante found in hell-border because\r\nthey had been sad under the blessed sun.’[548] How many people in ‘the\r\nworld,’ so called, are perfectly charming! Surely if there are many like\r\nthe Woods, Jerseys, William Lowthers, Pennants, Ilchesters, and oh! how\r\nmany others, good must far predominate over evil in society.\r\n\r\n“You know how I have always said I hated leaving London for Sundays, but\r\nI did leave it for three of them. The first was spent at Reigate\r\nManor--Lady Henry Somerset’s charming old house, with an oak panelled\r\nhall and staircase, such as one is surprised to find near London. Lady\r\nHenry is a delightful hostess, and though so enthusiastically interested\r\nin all her good works, keeps them quite in the background. I was so glad\r\nto find George Curzon at Reigate, as pleasant as ever, and his American\r\nwife; and he has so much to say on all subjects that one does not wonder\r\nhe has been spoken of as the man who ‘had seen everything, known\r\neverything, read all books, and written most of them.’ But yet the\r\n‘feature’ of the party was Lord Carlisle’s son, Hubert Howard, who\r\njumped upon the donkeys browsing in the park, and was kicked off by\r\nthem; then upon a stray long-haired pony, and was kicked off by it; and\r\nwho finally would go out to sea on the lake in a barrel in his Sunday\r\nclothes, and of course the barrel upset in the midst, and the nails with\r\nwhich it was studded left him with very few clothes at all.[549]\r\n\r\n“Then I was two days at Hatfield--days of brilliant sunshine, glowing\r\ngardens, scent of lime-flowers, great kindness from host and hostess,\r\nand much pleasant companionship. The rooms have names of trees: I was in\r\nthe hornbeam room, whence S. Alban’s Abbey was visible. I drew hard on\r\nSunday amid the brilliant flowers of the garden: oh! how wicked it would\r\nhave been thought when I was younger; but now no one thought it so. Most\r\nof the guests did nothing but talk and enjoy the summer beauty. Madame\r\nIgnatieff, coming to Hatfield, said, ‘Ah, I see what your life in great\r\ncountry-houses is--eat and doddle (dawdle), doddle and eat.’ Dear Sir\r\nAugustus Paget, of many pleasant Roman memories, sat out by me part of\r\nthe time, and on the Monday morning kept me after breakfast talking of\r\nhow very happy he was, how many enjoyments in his life. I could not help\r\nfeeling afterwards what characteristic ‘last words’ those were. I went\r\ninto the drawing-room to take leave of Lady Salisbury, and in an instant\r\nLady Cranborne ran in saying that Sir Augustus had fallen in the hall.\r\nHe scarcely spoke again, and on Saturday his bright spirit had\r\ndeparted. I was _very_ sorry. I had known him so long, and--I am again\r\nquoting George Eliot, whom I have just been reading--‘how unspeakably\r\nthe lengthening of memories in common endears one’s old friends.’\r\n\r\n“Lady Salisbury is delightful, not only to listen to but to watch. She\r\nis so young in her spirit. ‘On a l’age de son cœur.’ All she does, as\r\nall she says, is so clever, and her relation to her many\r\ndaughters-in-law, to the great variety of her visitors, to her vast\r\nhousehold, is so unfailingly sagacious. Even ‘to know her is a liberal\r\neducation,’ as Steele said of a lady he admired. She is a great contrast\r\nto Lord Salisbury: as I watched him solemnly and slowly walking up and\r\ndown the rooms with his hand on the head of his great dog Pharaoh, I was\r\nalways reminded of Henry Vaughan’s lines--\r\n\r\n    ‘The darksome statesman, hung with weight and woe,\r\n     Like to thick midnight fog, mov’d there so slow,\r\n            He did not stay, nor go.’\r\n\r\n“The next Sunday I was at Osterley, in intensely hot weather. Sir E.\r\nBurne Jones was there (as well as at Hatfield), the painter of morbid\r\nand unlovely women, who has given an apotheosis to ennui--the Botticelli\r\nof the nineteenth century. He is very agreeable naturally, and made\r\ninfinitely more so by his seductively captivating voice. He spoke much\r\nof Mr. Pepys’ ‘Diaries,’ and what a pity it was he became blind, ‘we\r\nmight have had so many more volumes.’ He described going to dine with\r\nthe Blumenthals, where the footman at the door presented him with a gilt\r\napple, and informed him that he was Paris, and would go down to dinner\r\nwith whichever of the Graces he presented it to. ‘I knew I must make two\r\ndeadly enemies,’ said Sir Edward, ‘so I shut my eyes and stretched out\r\nthe apple into space; _some one_ took it.’ He said peacocks made their\r\nshrill cry because they were afraid a thief might come and steal their\r\nbeauty away, and then he talked of the Talmud--‘that great repository of\r\ninteresting stories.’ The Grand-Vizier, he said, was terribly afraid\r\nSolomon would marry the Queen of Sheba, so he told the king her legs\r\nwere hairy. Then, in his wisdom, Solomon surrounded his throne with\r\nrunning water, and covered it with glass. And when the queen came to him\r\nand saw the water, she lifted up her trailing robe, and he beheld her\r\nlegs reflected in the glass, and they were not hairy, and he said, ‘The\r\nGrand-Vizier is a liar,’ and he put him to death. The beloved Halifaxes\r\nwere at Osterley, quite delightful always--\r\n\r\n    ‘Bright sparklings of all human excellence,\r\n     To which the silver wands of saints in heaven\r\n     Might point in rapturous joy.’[550]\r\n\r\n“After leaving London finally I went to Oxton Hall in Nottinghamshire\r\nfor my dear Hugh Bryan’s wedding with Miss Violet Sherbrooke--such a\r\npretty wedding--and thence to Wollaton Hall, Lord Middleton’s glorious\r\nold house near Nottingham. On the way I stayed to draw Nottingham\r\nCastle, which I had drawn as a boy, but they have quite spoilt it by\r\ntearing up its fine old plateau of grey flagstones, and putting down\r\nasphalt, only, of course, in the drawing I left that out. Wollaton is a\r\nbeautiful old grey stone building full of varied ornaments--niches,\r\npinnacles, and busts, with a central tower and huge central hall. It was\r\nbuilt by John of Padua with stone from Ancaster, all brought on donkeys,\r\nand for which nothing was paid, coal being taken and given in exchange\r\nfor it from a pit already open in Elizabeth’s time. In the church, to\r\nwhich we went on Sunday morning, is the tomb of John of Padua’s clerk of\r\nthe works, also the monument of Lady Anne Willoughby, _née_ Grey, aunt\r\nof Lady Jane, and a beautiful tomb of a Willoughby who was Knight of the\r\nHoly Sepulchre, with little effigies of his four wives, one of whom was\r\nmother of the Arctic voyager. The afternoon was wet, and amongst other\r\nrelics we saw the clothes of this Willoughby hero, left behind when he\r\nwent to the North Pole, and preserved with many other old dresses in a\r\nvast deserted upper chamber called ‘Bedlam,’ probably because the\r\n‘gentlemen’s gentlemen’ slept there in old times, as in a dormitory.\r\nThere is much else to see in the house, which was strongly fortified\r\nagainst the Nottingham rioters, and a number of handcuffs are hanging up\r\nwhich were prepared for them. The first evening I was alone with my\r\ndelightfully genial host and hostess, but on Saturday many guests came,\r\nincluding the exceedingly pleasant young Lord Deramore.\r\n\r\n“The late Lord Middleton lived in this palace in most primitive fashion.\r\nHe used to have dinner-parties, but the dinner consisted in a haunch of\r\nvenison at one end and a haunch of venison at the other, and\r\ncurrant-jelly in the middle, and then two apple-pies to match.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TERRACE DOOR, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n“Here is a delightful story of the present Bishop of London for you,\r\nwhich is _molto ben trovato_, at any rate. One day, he took a cab home\r\nto Fulham from the City, and wishing to be liberal, gave the man\r\nsixpence beyond the full fare. The man looked at it. ‘What, aren’t you\r\nsatisfied?’ said the Bishop. ‘Oh yes, I’m _satisfied_,’ said the man;\r\n‘but if I might, I should like to ask you a question.’ ‘Oh certainly,’\r\nsaid the Bishop, ‘ask whatever you like.’ ‘Well, then, if St. Paul had\r\ncome back to earth and was Bishop, do you suppose he’d be living in this\r\nhere palace?’ ‘Certainly not,’ replied the Bishop promptly, ‘for he’d be\r\nliving at Lambeth, and it would be a shilling fare.’\r\n\r\n“And now, after all these luxurious fine houses, I am in what, to me, is\r\nthe tenfold luxury of Holmhurst.\r\n\r\n    ‘My green and silent spot amid the hills,\r\n     Oh, ’tis a quiet spirit-healing nook.’[551]\r\n\r\nI should not like to live in a bare or commonplace house, but then I\r\ndon’t; and oh! the luxury of absolute independence. I should rather\r\n_like_ a carriage and horse perhaps, but I don’t in the least _want_\r\nthem. Certainly, in words I have been reading of Bishop Fraser, ‘living\r\nin comfort is a phrase entirely depending for its meaning on the ideas\r\nof him who uses it.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ FRANCIS COOKSON.\r\n\r\n“_Sept. 7._--Is it a sign of old age coming on, I wonder, when one has\r\nthe distaste for leaving home by which I am now possessed? I simply hate\r\nit. When one has all one wants and exactly what one likes, why should\r\none set off on a round of visits, in which one may, and probably will,\r\nhave many pleasant hours, but as certainly many bare and dull ones,\r\noften in dreary rooms, sometimes with wooden-headed people, and without\r\nthe possibility of the familiar associations which habit makes such a\r\npleasure? Then, in most country-houses, ‘l’anglais s’amuse moult\r\ntristement,’ as Froissart says. I cannot say how delightful I always\r\nfind my home life--the ever-fresh morning glories of the familiar view\r\nof brilliant flowers, green lawns, and oak woods; and then the sea,\r\nwhich to me is so much more beautiful in its morning whiteness with\r\nfaint grey cloud-shadows, or smiling under the tremulous sun-rays,[552]\r\nthan in the evening light, which brings a lovely but monotonous blueness\r\nwith it: the joyous companionship of my little black spitz Nero\r\n(‘Black,’ not the wicked emperor): the regularity of my proof-sheet\r\nwork, and other work, till luncheon-dinner, after which there are\r\ngenerally visitors to be attended to; and then quiet work again, or\r\nmeditation on the long-ago and the future, when\r\n\r\n    ‘Silent musings urge the mind to seek\r\n     Something too high for syllables to speak.’[553]\r\n\r\nThen there is always my library, in which 6000 agreeable friends are\r\nalways ready to converse with me at any moment, and ‘vingt-sept années\r\nd’ennui et de solitude lui firent lire bien des livres,’ as Catherine\r\nII. said in her epitaph on herself, might certainly be applied to me.\r\nOnly I can imagine, if eyes and limbs failed, the winter evenings\r\nbecoming long and monotonous. ‘Meglio solo che male accompagnato’ is a\r\ngood Italian proverb, only it would be pleasant to be ‘ben\r\naccompagnato.’ I am beginning to feel with Madame de Staël--‘J’aime la\r\nsolitude, mais il me faut à qui dire; j’aime la solitude.’\r\n\r\n“The neighbours are very kindly beginning to consider me ‘the hermit of\r\nHolmhurst,’ and come to visit me in my cell, especially on Tuesdays,\r\nwithout expecting me to go to them. I would not have a bicycle on any\r\naccount, for then I might be obliged to go, and I am too poor to have a\r\ncarriage. So, in six weeks, I have only twice been outside the\r\ngates--for one day to London for George Jolliffe’s wedding, and for two\r\nnights to Battle, whence, to my great joy, the Duchess asked me to\r\n‘mother’ her guests--charming Lady Edward Cavendish, the Vincent\r\nCorbets, and Mr. Armstrong, the Oxford history professor--to\r\nHurstmonceaux. How beautiful, how interesting it all looked. No other\r\nplace ever seems to me half so romantic; but though ‘at each step one\r\ntreads on a memory,’ as Cicero says, I can go there now without a pang;\r\nmy affections are too full of Holmhurst to have any room for it, and the\r\nold family are almost forgotten there already, ‘so much has happened\r\nsince they left.’ ‘Lord! to see how the world makes nothing of a man, an\r\nhoure after he is dead,’ writes Pepys in his Diary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NAYLOR LANDING, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n“I wonder if you ever saw Coventry Patmore here, who died lately. He\r\noften came to Holmhurst during the latter part of his residence at\r\nHastings, where he wrote ‘The Angel in the House’ in memory of his first\r\nwife, and in memory of his second spent most of the large fortune she\r\nhad brought him, £60,000, in building a beautiful church, S. Mary Star\r\nof the Sea; and whilst building it, though always a devout Catholic,\r\nimbibed, from being brought into close contact with them, a hatred of\r\npriests which never left him. The existence of ‘In Memoriam’ may be said\r\nto be due to Patmore. When young, he and Tennyson lodged together at\r\nsome house in London, where they had a violent quarrel with their\r\nlandlady, and left suddenly in a huff. Once well away, they recollected\r\nthat the MS. of ‘In Memoriam’ was left in the cupboard of their room\r\nwith the unfinished ham and the half-empty jam-pot. The timid Alfred\r\nwould not face the wrath of the landlady, but Patmore went back to get\r\nit. He found the woman cleaning her doorstep and told her that he was\r\ncome to get something he had left behind. ‘No,’ she said, ‘there was\r\nnothing, and she had seen quite enough of him, he should not go\r\nupstairs.’ But the slim Patmore took her by surprise, slipped past her,\r\nrushed up to the room, and from the jam cupboard extracted the MS., and\r\nmade off with it in spite of her imprecations.\r\n\r\n“Tennyson recognised what Patmore had done at the time, and said he\r\nshould give him the MS. But he never did; he gave it to Sir J. Simeon,\r\nwho left it to his second wife. When Tennyson’s MSS. rose so much in\r\nvalue, his family asked for it back, and Lady Simeon has promised that\r\nit shall go back at her death. In another generation, if Tennyson’s fame\r\nlasts so long, it will probably be sold for a large sum.\r\n\r\n“Apropos of poets, pleasant old Miss Courtenay was talking to me the\r\nother day of how Browning was beyond all things a man of the world\r\nrather than a poet. When she saw Mrs. Browning at Naples long ago, and\r\nexpressed some surprise at his being so much with Lockhart, who was then\r\nin his last serious illness, Mrs. Browning said, ‘Yes, and isn’t it\r\ndelightful that Mr. Lockhart likes him so much; he told me the other\r\nday, “I like Robert so much because he is not a damned _literary_\r\nperson!’”\r\n\r\n“The clergyman in the little iron tabernacle of a church at our gate\r\nseemed to some to preach at me last night for not having been at the\r\nmorning service, at which there was the Sacrament. He was quite right. I\r\nreally might have gone, for I had no ‘boys’ here, and I was not merely\r\nkept away by my detestation of sermons, so seldom, what Spurgeon said\r\nthey should be, ‘the man in flower;’ but I never thought of it, and was\r\nvery busy at home about a thousand things. But though I revere the\r\nSacrament as a holy commemorative ordinance, I cannot feel as if it did\r\none the slightest good, except as concentrating one’s thoughts for a\r\nfew minutes on sacred memories. James Adderley, the monk-preacher, says\r\nthere are many who regard the Sacrament like a ‘mourning ring;’ and that\r\nis exactly how I look upon it. I cannot understand how people can\r\nconsider such a mere commemorative service ‘a thing to live by,’ as they\r\ncall it; and all the transubstantiation idea is to me too truly\r\nhorrible. If I were dying--dying, I mean, in the trembling hope of a\r\nnear blessed reality--the reception of this mere type would be no\r\ncomfort to me. Then, also, as I am on the confession tack, I do not\r\nbelieve for one instant in ‘original sin;’ rather, as Solomon--who had\r\nmuch personal knowledge of the subject--says, that ‘God hath made man\r\nupright, but he hath sought out many inventions.’[554] ... And yet,\r\ntruly, in my own way, I always feel that--\r\n\r\n    ‘Malgré nous, vers le ciel il faut tourner les yeux.’”[555]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL _and_ LETTERS.\r\n\r\n“_Chesters, Northumberland, Oct. 6._--All my dread of visits passed away\r\nwhen they began. Capital indeed is Milton’s advice--\r\n\r\n                  ‘Be not over-exquisite\r\n    To cast the fashion of uncertain evils.’\r\n\r\nAnd then I know one ought to go into the world ‘as a fireman on duty,’\r\nwhich Cardinal Manning said was his only way of visiting it for thirty\r\nyears. One thing a man who pays a good many visits should always be\r\ncertain of--_never_ to outstay his welcome. It would be dreadful to see\r\none’s hostess begin to have the fidgets. It is safest--at latest--to go\r\nby the eleven o’clock train, but a good and pleasant plan is to take\r\nleave overnight, and _be_ gone the next morning. I was full of enjoyment\r\nat Penrhyn Castle--the genial and charming family, the great variety of\r\nthe guests, and the excursions, in spite of furious storms, into the\r\nWelsh hills. Then I was with a most kind bachelor host, Fred Swete, at\r\nOswestry, and spent the day at Brogyntyn with Lord Harlech, a perfect\r\nexample of old-fashioned courtesy and kindness. In his grounds is a long\r\nterrace with a glorious view over the plains and hills of Shropshire,\r\nincluding the beloved Hawkestone range of my childhood. The next day, at\r\nthe Brownlow-Towers’ pleasant house at Ellesmere, a little girl of eight\r\nwas most amusingly _fin de siècle_. ‘Now, darling, you must go up to the\r\nschoolroom and stay there,’ said her mother after luncheon. ‘No,\r\ndarling, no,’ answered the child. ‘I must not, darling,’ with an exact\r\nimitation of its mother’s manner, ‘for I’ve been listening, and it’s\r\ngoing to be interesting.’\r\n\r\n“We made delightful excursions from Lutwyche to draw at Bridgenorth and\r\nan old moated grange called Elswick, meeting Lady Boyne and her party,\r\nwho came from Burwarton as to a half-way house.\r\n\r\n“Then I was at Ridley Hall, full of--oh! how many memories of my\r\nlong-ago. But it was the greatest pleasure to see Frank and Lady Anne\r\nLyon there, and how much they appreciated and cared for the place. Lord\r\nand Lady Wantage were at Ridley, and I went with them to Hexham Abbey,\r\nonce a most grand church, but utterly ruined by an ignorant\r\nrestoration. And now, wandering still on the footprints of past days, I\r\nam at Chesters with the widow and children of my dear old friend George\r\nClayton, he as well as all the earlier generation of his family having\r\npassed away, and Miss Annie Ogle, whom I knew so well in those far-away\r\ndays, here as a delightful _old_ lady, with snow-white hair, but the\r\nsame winning character and ways as in her youth. A museum has been built\r\nnow for the immense collection of Roman altars and fragments, &c., from\r\nthe ‘stations’ of the Roman wall, one of the best of which (Cilurnum) is\r\njust in front of the house; while below ‘the riotous rapids of the\r\nTyne,’ as Swinburne calls them, with their rocky shores and bosky banks,\r\nare the boundary of the park.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Redholm, North Berwick, Oct. 17._--I am staying here with Robert Shaw\r\nStewart, a friend of old Roman days, and his kind wife, who was a\r\ndaughter of Charles Warner, the well-known statesman-philanthropist of\r\nTrinidad,--‘fort comme le diamant, plus tendre qu’une mère’--of whom\r\nFroude has given so charming a description. The Dalzells and all my\r\nother dear friends of past days here have gone over the border-land,\r\nbut, in this hospitable house, I have seen quite a diorama of people. A\r\ntopic has been the three modern Scotch novelists, Crockett,[556]\r\nBarrie,[557] and Ian Maclaren (Watson): Crockett such a delightful\r\nfellow, so full of sunshine, of real happy enjoyment of people and\r\nthings: Barrie, a weaver’s boy as to his origin, but simple and\r\nstraightforward to a degree, though his books have made him rich: Watson\r\njust a little spoilt since the great success of his annals of\r\nDrumtochty, which, under another name (Logiealmond, near Glenalmond) was\r\nthe place where he was minister. The Free Kirk minister in this place,\r\nDr. Davidson, told me how when they all were at college together, Barrie\r\nand Crockett used to tell stories in class. They sate up in a corner,\r\nwith a little coterie round them, and held their audience enthralled. No\r\none listened to the lecturer, and some of the students outside the\r\ncharmed circle used to say, ‘Had not you better send down to the\r\nprofessor and tell him not to make so much noise?’ The lower orders in\r\nScotland seem to read the modern national novelists just as much as the\r\nupper, and they read other deeper books too, and think calmly in a way\r\nvery unlike Englishmen. ‘The Shorter Catechism,’ which they all\r\nunderstand, is a proof of this. When it was published, indeed, there was\r\na far more serious catechism for adults: this one was only intended for\r\n‘those of tender years,’ yet there is much requiring deepest thought in\r\nit, though the peasant classes always master it.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Airlie Castle, Oct. 18._--Monday was fearfully cold, and it was a\r\npleasure to see the beautiful face of Lady Airlie--more picturesque and\r\ndistinguished in late middle life than any one else--looking out of a\r\nclose carriage come to meet me. Her most poetical home is just suited to\r\nher--the tiniest castle in the world, with its one noble gate-tower\r\ngiving access to a little green plateau beneath which the Melgum and\r\nthe Isla rush through deep wooded gorges to their meeting-place. And\r\ninto these gorges the castle windows look deep down. Then, to those who\r\nknow Lady Airlie, I need not say how beautiful the little rooms are, how\r\nsplendid the few flowers, how much of story clusters round the furniture\r\nand pictures--‘only a few; I do not like a room or a wall to be crowded,\r\neven with the best things,’ says their mistress.\r\n\r\n“In the serene beauty of her age, she herself lends a lustre to her\r\nsurroundings; quietly, contentedly severing most links with the great\r\nworld in which she has so long been a star, ‘elle dépose fleur à fleur\r\nla couronne de la vie.’[558]\r\n\r\n“Lady Maude White is here, returning to an intellectual world with which\r\nshe has never broken a single link, after many years of privation,\r\nsolitude, and duty nobly borne, first with her brother, and then with\r\nher husband, at a horse-ranch in America.\r\n\r\n“The castle of Airlie has never recovered its burning by Argyll and the\r\nCovenanters, when\r\n\r\n    ‘It fell on a day, a bonnie summer day,\r\n       When the corn was brearin’ fairly,\r\n     That there fell out a great dispute\r\n       Between Argyll and Airlie.’\r\n\r\nThe family were always for the King and the Church, indeed too much so,\r\nfor Maryott Ogilvy was the mistress of Cardinal Beaton, for whom he\r\nbuilt several castles, and who was enormously endowed by him. Of their\r\nsix children, the eldest girl had the richest dower in Scotland, and\r\nmarried the Lord Crawford of that day. It was David, Lord Ogilvy, who\r\nwas out in the ‘45, who rebuilt a bit of the old castle, just enough to\r\nlive in by himself after he came home, and added a few rooms for his\r\nwife when he married a second time. Behind the castle is a delightful\r\nold garden, to which Lady Airlie has added hedges and peacocks in\r\nclipped yew, with divers other ‘incidents;’ and all along the ledges of\r\nthe gorges run wonderful little pathlets--beautiful exceedingly in the\r\ncrimson and gold of their autumnal glory. But they will be gone\r\ndirectly; for, as Edward Fitzgerald says, ‘The trees in the Highlands\r\ngive themselves no dying airs, but turn orange in a day, and are swept\r\noff in a whirlwind, and winter is come.’\r\n\r\n“We drove to Cortachy through woods laid prostrate by the great storm of\r\n1893, which has left the trees piled on one another, like the dead of a\r\nvanquished army on a battlefield. Lady Airlie made the whole of the\r\nweird desolate country live through her interpretation of it:--\r\n\r\n“‘Those are the black hornless cattle of Angus. That is the hill of\r\nClota, on the top of which is the old tower where the last witch was\r\nburnt. In the church books there is an entry that on a particular day\r\nthere was no service, because all the congregation were gone to the\r\nburning of the witch. That village in the hollow, which is so red and\r\nstriking in the sunset, is Kirriemuir: it is the “Thrums” of Barrie’s\r\nnovel. Now we will leave the carriage at “the Devil’s Stone:” it is just\r\na stone which the devil threw at the kirk, but it missed and fell into\r\nthe stream: it rests the opposite way to all boulders, and it is of a\r\ndifferent formation from all the other stones in the district. Dicky\r\nDoyle loved the story and the stone, and used to paint it. And now we\r\nwill go into the “Garden of Friendship.” I made it when I first married\r\nout of an old kitchen-garden, and I cut down a belt of trees and let in\r\nthe view. The lines in the summer-house are by Robert Lowe. All the\r\ntrees bear the names of the different friends who planted them. That one\r\nwas planted by Dr. John Brown. He was often here. He told me that my\r\nClementine was a lassie who had said something she might be proud of.\r\nThat was because one day when I said to her, “I am so tired; are not you\r\ntired, darling?” she answered, “Tired! oh no, not a bit. I have a box of\r\nlaughter inside me, and the key that unlocks it is ‘fun.’” Over there is\r\nour deer-forest. Charlotte, Lady Strathmore, took me up to the tower of\r\nGlamis once, and stretched out her hand towards our hills--“You have a\r\ndeer-forest, and a river, and _scenery_” she said, “and I have\r\n_nothing_.”\r\n\r\n“‘Here is King Charles’s room. Charles II. was here for the gathering of\r\nthe clans, but they did not gather as they ought, and he went away\r\ndisappointed. He left a Prayer-book and a Euclid here: he was a great\r\nscientist. Under the floor at that corner is a secret room: we have\r\nnever seen it. Some workmen found it after the great fire here whilst\r\nevery one was away, and before we came back it was walled up, and it has\r\nnever been thought worth while to disturb it again. Those are the\r\nportraits of the Ogilvy who was out in the ‘45 and his first wife. She\r\nwas shut up in the Tolbooth for singing Jacobite songs in the Canongate.\r\nHe was devoted to her, but after they went to St. Germains he was told\r\nthat he must take a mistress because it was the fashion, and he did.\r\nAfter her death he married again, an extravagant woman, who wheedled\r\nhim out of £3000 which he had saved to buy the property on the other\r\nside of the river at Airlie,[559] and spent it on her own devices. They\r\nquarrelled at last, for she would give a ball at Airlie Lodge at Dundee,\r\nand he told her if she did he would never forgive it; and she had the\r\nball, and he never saw her again.’\r\n\r\n“Lord Airlie is a splendid young man,[560] and has the most delightful\r\nof wives in one of the granddaughters of the beloved Lady Jocelyn. He is\r\na consummate soldier. His devotion to his profession only allows him to\r\nbe six weeks at Cortachy in the year, but in that time he drives about\r\nand visits every person on the estate. He has the firm faith and strong\r\nreligious feeling of his Ogilvy forbears. One day, at the gate of Airlie\r\nCastle, with its unprotected precipices, he had mounted a dogcart with\r\nhis sister Clementine. The horse plunged and backed violently. They were\r\non the very edge of the abyss. ‘Make your peace with God,’ he said to\r\nhis sister; ‘in an instant we shall be over.’ At the very last moment a\r\nman rushed out and caught the horse, but the wheels were half over then.\r\n\r\n“To-day we have been to see the Monros at Lindertis--a semi-gothic\r\nhouse, most comfortable inside. Mrs. Munro is a capital portrait-painter\r\nin the style of Raeburn, and has done first-rate work. All evening Lady\r\nAirlie has talked delightfully:--\r\n\r\n“‘We were a very quarrelsome family as children. At Gosport, whilst we\r\nwere at church, my next sister, Cecilia,[561] who had been left at home,\r\nfell out of the window. She lived for some days, very suffering and\r\nscarcely conscious, but she used constantly, in her half-delirium, to\r\nsay, “Oh, don’t quarrel, don’t quarrel;” and it made a very great\r\nimpression upon me, and afterwards I always tried never to quarrel. My\r\nfather never let us complain. If anything unpleasant happened and my\r\nmother murmured, he would always say, “Oh, don’t; we have so much more\r\nthan we _deserve_.” He always thought it so ill-bred--so ill-bred\r\ntowards God--to murmur. A widow, especially, should never murmur. If one\r\nhas had a great place and occupied a great position which all vanishes\r\nwith one’s husband, one ought to be so filled with gratitude for the\r\nhas-been as to leave no room for complaints. “I have lived my life: I\r\nhave enjoyed to the utmost,” that should always be the feeling. It is\r\nterrible when a widow murmurs, for it is God who gave the husband, who\r\ngave the home; and when He takes them away again, how can one doubt that\r\nHe knows best when one has had enough? For children, leaving an old home\r\nis worse than for the widow: she has lived her life, but theirs is to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n“‘Before I grew up, my mother often took me with her to Miss Berry’s in\r\nthe evening. My father was away at the House, and she took her work and\r\nwent there, and Miss Berry liked to see that good and beautiful young\r\nwoman sitting there. At Miss Berry’s house I saw all the clever men of\r\nthe day, so I knew them all before I really came out. I shall never\r\nforget going down once to Richmond to take leave of Miss Berry before we\r\nwent into the country, and her saying to me, “Allez vous retremper l’âme\r\nà la campagne;” it seemed to me such a beautiful thought. Forty years\r\nafterwards my daughter Blanche told it to Schouvaloff, the Russian\r\nMinister. “Oui,” he said, and added, “et engourdir l’esprit.” It was as\r\ncharacteristic of him as the first part of the sentence was of Miss\r\nBerry.\r\n\r\n“‘As soon as I came out, I went with my parents to the Grange, where the\r\nfirst Lady Ashburton was very kind to me, and I passionately adored her.\r\nThere I first saw Carlyle and Mrs. Carlyle, but he had known my mother\r\nvery well before. Mrs. Carlyle really loved Lady Ashburton, yet she was\r\nmadly jealous of her. When they were at home, and Carlyle would come in\r\nquite tired out with a long day’s work, she would say, “Now just walk\r\ndown to Bath House and see Lady Ashburton, and that will refresh you.”\r\nShe meant him to go, but as soon as he was gone her grief was\r\npassionate, because she felt it would not have been the same thing to\r\nhim if he had stayed with her. He was always pleasant, but to a few--to\r\nmy mother especially--he never failed to show the most intense delicacy\r\nof feeling.\r\n\r\n“‘I cannot describe what Charles Buller was. Girl as I was, I loved him,\r\nbut so did every one else; he was so very delightful. I remember as if\r\nit were to-day going once into my mother’s room: all her long beautiful\r\nhair was down and she was sobbing violently. “Oh,” she said, “Charles\r\nBuller is dead.” How I longed to cry too, but I did not dare. I only\r\nwent to my own room in most bitter grief. Wherever he went, Charles\r\nBuller brought sunshine with him. He left me his Coleridge in his will.\r\nIt surprised people that he should leave anything to a young girl like\r\nme, and when I went to the Grange again, many spoke of it. Each had\r\nsomething to show which had belonged to him: we all mourned together.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, how many recollections there are which will always remain with\r\none, which will stay by one at the resurrection. Many of my happiest are\r\nof the Grange. Lord Houghton asked me once how long I had been there,\r\nand he told me long afterwards that I had answered “Oh, I cannot tell; I\r\nonly know that it is morning when I come, and night when I go away.”\r\nThis bookcase is full of the gifts of friends, and recalls much of my\r\npast. Here is a volume of Thackeray with an etching by himself, and here\r\nare all John Morley’s and Lord Sherbrooke’s books, which they gave me as\r\nthey came out. Here is Lord Houghton’s “Monographs,” with a touching\r\nletter from him after we had had a little coldness; and here are two\r\nbound volumes of Mrs. Carlyle’s Letters to me.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Balcaskie, Oct. 21._--What a wild country is this ‘low, sea-salted,\r\nwind-vexed’ Fife, with its little royal boroughs along the coast, each\r\nwith its tiny municipality. About them their natives have the same\r\npride, however, as an Aberdonian, who said the other day, ‘Just tak’ awa\r\nAberdeen and twenty mile round her, and where are ye?’ The sea-line is\r\nbroken by islets, the most important of them being May, where S. Adrian\r\nlived in a hermitage, and where the steps at the very difficult\r\nlanding-place are worn away by the knees of the pilgrims to his shrine.\r\nS. Monan lived there after him, but also frequented a little cave on the\r\nmainland, where the old church stands to which we went on Sunday, so\r\nnear the waves that, in rough weather, the roar of the surges mingles\r\nwith the music.\r\n\r\n“Highly picturesque is this house of Balcaskie, and its high-terraced\r\ngardens with their vases and statues. The Anstruthers have taken me to\r\nBalcarres to spend the afternoon with ever-sunny Lady Crawford. Her\r\nhusband, weird-looking as an old necromancer, only came in as we were\r\nleaving, but several of the handsome sons were at home. The house looks\r\ngloomy outside from the black stone of the country, but is bright and\r\ncheerful within, and has a beautiful oak-panelled parlour.\r\n\r\n“On Sunday afternoon we went to Kellie, a noble stern old castle, with\r\ncorbie-steps and tourelles. It was neglected and deserted by the Earls\r\nof Kellie, but has been restored by Mrs. Lorimer, widow of an Edinburgh\r\nprofessor, who rents it. ‘Two little red shoes’ haunt it, pattering up\r\nand down its winding staircases at night. At Crail we saw wonderful old\r\ntombs of the Lindsays in the churchyard, and inside the church that of\r\nMiss Cunningham, who, said the sacristan, died on the eve of her\r\nmarriage with some great poet whose name he could not remember: we\r\nafterwards found it was Drummond of Hawthornden.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Bishopthorpe, Oct. 23._--This house has a charm from the great variety\r\nof its styles, even the gingerbread-gothic is important as being of a\r\ndate anterior to Horace Walpole, who has the reputation of having\r\nintroduced that style.\r\n\r\n“The Archbishop of York says, ‘From sudden death, good Lord deliver us,’\r\nmeans, ‘From dying unprepared for death, good Lord deliver us.’\r\n\r\n“Lord Falkland has been here. He had been lately at Skelton Castle. His\r\nhostess, Miss Wharton, took him to his room, down a long passage--a\r\nlarge room, panelled with dark oak and with a great four-post bed with\r\nheavy hangings. It was very gloomy and oppressive, Lord Falkland\r\nthought, but he said nothing, dressed, and went down to dinner.\r\n\r\n“When he came upstairs again, he found the aspect of the room even more\r\noppressive, but he made up a great fire and went to bed. In the night he\r\nwas awakened by a pattering on the floor as of high-heeled shoes and the\r\nrustling of a stiff silk dress. There was still a little fire burning,\r\nbut he could see nothing. As he distinctly heard the footsteps turn, he\r\nthought, ‘Oh, I hope they may not come up to the bed.’ They _did_. But\r\nthen they turned away, and he heard them go out at the door.\r\n\r\n“With difficulty he composed himself to sleep again, but was soon\r\nreawakened by the same sound, the rustling of silk and the footsteps.\r\nThen he was thoroughly miserable, got up, lighted candles, made up the\r\nfire, and passed a wretched night. In the morning he was glad to find an\r\nexcuse for going away.\r\n\r\n“Afterwards he heard an explanation. An old Wharton, cruel and brutal,\r\nhad a young wife. One day, coming tipsy into his wife’s room, he found\r\nher nursing her baby. He was in a violent temper, and, seizing the baby\r\nfrom her arms, he dashed its head against the wall and killed it on the\r\nspot. When he saw it was dead, he softened at once. Even in her grief\r\nand horror Mrs. Wharton could not bear to expose him, and together they\r\nburied the child under the hearthstone; but she pined away and very soon\r\nshe died.\r\n\r\n“She used to be heard not only rustling, but weeping, wailing, sobbing,\r\ncrying. At that time the Whartons were Roman Catholics, and when the\r\nfamily were almost driven from their home by its terrors, they got a\r\npriest to exorcise the castle and to bury the baby skeleton in\r\nconsecrated ground. Since then, there have been no sobs and cries, only\r\nthe rustling and pattering of feet.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS GARDEN _at Rome_.\r\n\r\n“_Oct. 26, 1896._--The first three volumes of the ‘Story of my Life’ are\r\ncome out, and I send them to you. Even the favourable reviews complain\r\nvehemently about their length; and yet, if they were not in a huge type\r\nand had not quite half a volume’s space full of woodcuts, they might\r\neasily have been two very moderate volumes.[562] Then, say the\r\nreviewers, ‘the public would have welcomed the book.’ But after all, it\r\nwas not written or printed for the public, only for a private inner\r\ncircle, though I am sure that, in return for having been allowed to read\r\nit, ‘the public’ will kindly be willing--well, just to _pay_ for the\r\nprinting! Then it is funny how each review wants a different part left\r\nout--one the childhood, one the youth, one the experiences of later\r\nlife: there would be nothing left but the little anecdotes about already\r\nwell-known people, which they all wish to keep, and, in quoting these,\r\nthey one and all copy each other; it saves trouble. The _Saturday_ had\r\nwhat the world calls ‘a cruel review’ of the book, but what was really\r\nan article of nothing but personal vituperation against its author. I\r\nknow who the review was by, and that it was not, as every one seems to\r\nthink, by one of the family from whom I suffered in my childhood;\r\ncertainly, however, if any one cares to know how the members of that\r\nfamily always spoke to and of me in my youth, they have only to read\r\nthat article. I think there is a good bit about criticism in Matthew\r\nArnold’s Letters. ‘The great thing is to speak without a particle of\r\nvice, malice, or rancour.... Even in one’s ridicule one must preserve a\r\nsweetness and good-humour.... I remember how Voltaire lamented that the\r\n“literae humanae,” _humane_ letters, should be so dreadfully _inhuman_,\r\nand determined in print to be always scrupulously polite.’ Then, how\r\ntruly Ruskin says, ‘The _slightest_ manifestation of jealousy or\r\nself-complacency is sufficient to mark a second-rate character of\r\nintellect.’\r\n\r\n“As you know, I never intended the book, written seventeen and printed\r\ntwo years ago, to appear till after my death, but this year it was so\r\nstrongly represented to me that then all who would care to read about my\r\nearlier years would then be _dead too_, that I assented to the story up\r\nto 1870 being published. To tell the truth, I feel now how sorry I\r\nshould have been to have missed the amusement of hearing even the most\r\nabusive things people say. And certainly, as regards reviews, I feel\r\nwith Washington Irving, ‘I have one proud reflection to sustain myself\r\nwith--that I never in any way sought to win the praises nor deprecate\r\nthe censures of reviewers, but have left my work to rise or fall by its\r\nown deserts. If my writings are worth anything, they will outlive\r\ntemporary criticism; if not, they are not worth caring about.’[563]\r\nYet, yet, just for the sake of variety, I should like some day, as a\r\nchange to the unknown, to read a really favourable review of _something_\r\nI have written, though I read somewhere, ‘To like to be right is the\r\nlast weakness of a wise man: to like to be thought right is the\r\ninveterate prejudice of fools.’[564]\r\n\r\n“One of the things people find fault with is that I have not shown\r\nsufficient adoration for Jowett, who was so exceedingly kind to me at\r\nOxford. But I always felt that it was for Arthur Stanley’s sake. Jowett\r\nonly really cared for three kinds of undergraduate--a pauper, a\r\nprofligate, or a peer: he was boundlessly good to the first, he tried to\r\nreclaim the second, and he adored the third.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Blaise Castle, Henbury, Nov. 23._--I came here to charming Mary\r\nHarford[565] from Lockinge, where I paid a pleasant visit to Lord and\r\nLady Wantage, meeting a large party. Lady Wantage, beautified by the\r\nglory of her snowy hair, was most charming--so thoughtful and kind for\r\nevery one--‘elle brillait surtout par le caractère,’[566] and though\r\n‘few can understand an argument, all can appreciate a character.’[567]\r\nOne of the most agreeable guests, a ripple of interesting anecdote,\r\nwhich began even in the omnibus driving up from the station in the dark,\r\nwas Lord James of Hereford. At dinner he told how Sir Drummond and Lady\r\nWolff had a Spanish dog, who was the best-bred creature in the world.\r\nOne day its mistress had a visitor who engrossed her so much that she\r\nforgot her dog’s dinner. It would not scratch or whine, it was too well\r\nconducted, but it went out into the garden and bit off a flower, and\r\ncame and laid it at its mistress’s feet: the flower was a forget-me-not.\r\n\r\n“George Holford of Westonburt was at Lockinge, and very pleasant. Once\r\nhe walked from London to Ardington, close to Lockinge, where his\r\ngrandmother, Mrs. Lindsay, was then living. When he was within a mile\r\nand a half of it, he saw a man kneeling on the body of another man on\r\nthe road. He went up to them, called out, had no answer, and at last\r\nstruck the kneeling man with his stick. His stick went through the man.\r\nHis story was received at Lockinge with shouts of derision.\r\n\r\n“Three years after, at a tenants’ dinner, Lord Wantage told the story of\r\nhis nephew’s ‘optical delusion’ to the farmer sitting next, who said,\r\n‘It is a very extraordinary thing, my Lord, but a man _was_ once\r\nmurdered by his servant on that very spot. The servant knocked him down,\r\nknelt upon him, and killed him; and ever since the place has had the\r\nreputation of being haunted.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ VISCOUNT HALIFAX.\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 9, 1897._--My Christmas was spent very pleasantly at Hewell,\r\nwhere Lord and Lady Windsor had a large party. Most lovely and charming\r\nwas the hostess, most stately and beautiful the great modern house by\r\nBodley, greatly improved and embellished since I saw it last. How\r\nclosely, during a week’s visit, one is thrown with people, whom one\r\noften does not see again for years, if ever. It is, as Florence\r\nMontgomery says--‘People in a country-house play their parts, as it\r\nwere, before one, and then the curtain falls, and the actors disappear.\r\nThe play is played out.’[568] How laden with gifts children are\r\nnowadays, and how far too luxurious their life is, as much in excess\r\nthat way as in the privations and penances which I remember in my own\r\nchildhood.\r\n\r\n“Some people are very angry with me for telling the truth in the ‘Story\r\nof my Life’[569] about these young years, when I was suffering ‘from an\r\nindiscriminate theological education,’ as Mr. Schimmelpennick calls\r\nsuch, and when I was made so constantly to feel how ‘l’ennui n’a pas\r\ncessé d’être en Angleterre une institution religeuse.’[570] And it is\r\nnot merely the ‘canaille of talkers in type’[571] who find fault, but\r\nmany whose opinion I have a regard for. They think that the portrait of\r\na dead person should never be like a Franz Hals, portraying every\r\n‘projecting peculiarity,’ but all delicately wrought with the smooth\r\nenamelling touch of Carlo Dolce. They wonder I can ‘reconcile it to my\r\nconscience’ to hold ‘another estimate of the Maurices to that which has\r\nbeen hitherto popular.’ ‘Collect a bag of prejudices and call it\r\nconscience, and there you are!’[572] For myself, I believe, and I am\r\nsure it is the discipline of years which tells me so, that the rule of\r\nafter-death praise is a false one to be regulated by. It is true that\r\nthere is often an enlightenment from death upon sensations and\r\nsympathies towards one who is gone, but I cannot feel that a faithful\r\nrecord of words and actions ought to be altered by the mere _glamour_ of\r\ndeath, which so often gives an apotheosis to those who little deserve\r\nit. One of my reviewers says he would like to read a truthful\r\nword-portrait of Augustus Hare by one of the persons he describes in\r\nprint: so should I exceedingly, and most appallingly horrible it would\r\nbe!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ARSON STEPS, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n    ‘O wad some power the giftie gi’e us\r\n     To see oorsels as ithers see us,’[573]\r\n\r\nis what I would often say. Lately, a wonder whether I can have misjudged\r\nor exaggerated my remembrance of the long-ago has made me give many\r\nsolitary evenings to old-letter reading; yet contemporary letters only\r\nconfirm _all_ I have expressed. How interesting they are! It is as\r\nArchbishop Magee says, ‘Old letters are like old ghosts, coming often\r\nuncalled for and startling us with their old familiar faces--pleasant\r\nsome of them, and some of them very ugly, but all of them dead and\r\nbearing the stamp of death--and yet they will survive ourselves.’\r\n\r\n“Most extraordinarily _virulent_ certainly reviews can be! Really,\r\n‘hurricanes of calumny and tornados of abuse’[574] have been hurled at\r\nme. As Cardinal Manning said, ‘To write anonymously is always a danger\r\nto charity, truth, and justice.’ _Blackwood_ (_i.e._ the Maurice spirit\r\nin _Blackwood_), in an article which breathes of white lips, after\r\ndwelling scornfully upon ‘the sickening honey of the “Memorials,”’\r\nwrites:--\r\n\r\n“What is Mr. Augustus Hare? He is neither anybody nor nobody--neither\r\nmale nor female--neither imbecile nor wise.... As we wade through this\r\nfoam of superannuated wrath ... this vicious and venomous personal\r\nonslaught ... Mr. Hare’s paragraphs plump like drops of concentrated\r\nvenom over the dinted page.... Such a tenacity of ill-feeling, such a\r\ncold rage of vituperation, is seldom to be met with.’\r\n\r\n“I wonder a little if any one can really from his heart have offered\r\nsuch ‘a genuine tribute of undissembled horror,’ or whether these\r\nsentiments were only written to order? And then I look at Dante and\r\nread:--\r\n\r\n    ‘Vien dietro a me, e lascia dir le genti;\r\n     Sta come torre ferma che non crolla\r\n     Giammai la cima per soffiar de’ venti’[575]\r\n\r\nAnd so--\r\n\r\n    ‘I, painting from myself and to myself,\r\n     Know what I do, am unmoved by men’s blame,\r\n     Or their praise either.’”[576]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 31, 1897._--Saw Lady Delawarr, and heard all about her marvellous\r\nescape. Lady Mary (Sackville) first heard a crackling noise between two\r\nand three in the morning, and, looking out of her room door, saw that\r\nthe staircase[577] was in flames. She rushed into her sister Margaret’s\r\nroom, roused her, shrieked to the maids and governess, and finding a\r\nfiery gulf separated them from their mother’s room, the sisters flew in\r\ntheir night-dresses down the stairs, already in flames, and into the\r\nstreet. Lady Delawarr, stupefied by smoke, slept on heavily, though for\r\ntwenty minutes her old servant Vincent, who occupied a room off the\r\ngarden, threw stones at her window. He dragged his mattress beneath it,\r\nand strained it across the garden area. At last he roused her, and she\r\nrushed to the door, but closed it again as the flames poured in. Then\r\nshe threw up the window. ‘Jump, my lady, jump!’ shouted Vincent; ‘there\r\nis not a moment to lose.’ There was not time even to throw out her\r\ndiamonds, but she knotted her sheets firmly together, and sliding down\r\nthem, dropped upon the mattress. With her it held, but the fat cook, who\r\nhad not had courage to face the fiery staircase, leapt from the fourth\r\nfloor, and under her great weight the mattress gave way and she fell\r\ninto the area, breaking her leg in three places and fracturing her\r\nskull, and now she is dead. For a whole hour Lady Delawarr crouched\r\nbehind the lilac bushes in the ice-bound garden, with the blazing house\r\nbetween her and all else. Then she succeeded in breaking the window of a\r\ncarpenter’s shop which adjoined the garden, and was dragged through it,\r\nand reached a friend’s house in a four-wheel cab.\r\n\r\n“This cab she sent back to fetch her daughter Mary, but the horse fell\r\non the ice in Grosvenor Square, and Lady Mary, as she was, had to walk\r\nup Upper Brook Street to the house where her mother had taken refuge.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Jan. 28._--Dined at Lady Hope’s to meet Dr. Tucker, Bishop of Uganda,\r\nwho had walked 10,000 miles in his bishopric; there were no other means\r\nof locomotion. He said Africa as a whole was more swamp and thicket than\r\ndesert. ‘Were not the lions alarming?’ ‘Not very; they seldom attacked\r\nunless irritated.’ Once he saw five at the same time around him, but\r\n‘they all had their own affairs to attend to.’ Snakes were worse,\r\nespecially puff-adders, which would attack whenever they could.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Feb. 2, 1897._--Dreadful news has come of the terrible murder in the\r\nBenin expedition of my dear Kenneth Campbell (of Ardpatrick), than whom\r\nno one was better, braver, more attractive to look upon, or more\r\npleasant to live with.\r\n\r\n ‘I loved him, and love him for ever: the dead are not dead, but alive.’[578]\r\n\r\nYet a shadow is thrown over everything, and when even his friend feels\r\nas if he could never write or speak of him without tears, what must not\r\nit be to his parents! One had felt that he, if any one, had ‘i pensieri\r\nstretti ed il viso sciolto’ which would ‘go safely over the whole\r\nworld,’ as Alberto Scipioni said to Sir Henry Wotton, and which the\r\nlatter recommended to Milton when asked for advice as to his travels.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MRS. C. VAUGHAN.\r\n\r\n“_May 8, 1897._--Do you remember the article on my book, or rather on\r\nme, headed ‘A Monument of Self-Sufficiency,’ which amused us both so\r\nmuch? Dining at Lady Margaret Watney’s, I sate opposite to Mr. E. G. who\r\nwrote it--a pleasant man and much liked--and longed to make acquaintance\r\nwith him, but had not the chance. Last night I dined with Lady\r\nAshburton, a quiet party, with all the beautiful Kent House pictures\r\nlighted up. Mr. Henschel whistled like a bullfinch at dinner, and sang\r\ngloriously ‘Der Kaiser’ afterwards. Mrs. F. Myers, who sate by me, was\r\nmost agreeable, and is one of those with whom one soon penetrates\r\n‘l’écorce extérieur de la vie,’ as our dear S. Simon calls it. Amongst a\r\nthousand interesting things, she told me that, at Cambridge, she found\r\nLord De Rothschild’s son especially difficult to get on with, till one\r\nday he startled her by asking, ‘Have you got any fleas?’ She was\r\nsurprised, but found that special point of Natural History was just the\r\none thing he cared about, knew about, and would talk on for ever; and\r\nshe was able to get him some rare fleas from a friend in India, with\r\nwhich he was greatly delighted.\r\n\r\n“I also sate at dinner by ...whose father was ambassador at Vienna. He\r\nrented Prince Clary’s house. One day, as a little girl, she was at the\r\nend of the drawing-room with her mother, when they both saw a\r\nchasseur--their own chasseur, they supposed--standing in an alcove at\r\nthe end of the room. ‘Oh, there is Fritz,’ said her mother. ‘What can he\r\nbe doing there? Run and tell him to go downstairs.’ She ran across the\r\nroom, but as she came up to the alcove the chasseur seemed to vanish.\r\nThis happened three times; then the mother said, ‘If we were\r\nsuperstitious we might say we had seen a ghost, but it can be only a\r\nquestion of angles.’ Soon afterwards her father met Prince Clary at\r\ndinner and began, ‘Have you ever been troubled by any appearance?’ &c.\r\n‘Oh, don’t speak of it,’ exclaimed Prince Clary; ‘it is a most painful\r\nsubject: the fact is, that, in a fit of anger, my father killed his\r\nchasseur on that spot.’ Sir Augustus Loftus, who succeeded at the\r\nEmbassy, took the same house, and reproached them much for not warning\r\nhim of the apparition, on account of which he soon left and went to live\r\nin a hotel.\r\n\r\n“At Easter I was with the Carysforts at Elton, and was taken to see\r\nCastor, with its fine Roman and Norman remains, and Stobbington, a very\r\ninteresting old house, with a most curious collection of rare living\r\nfish, the pets of its owner. Lady Alwyn Compton, who was at Elton, told\r\nme a curious story. It was one of the great commentators--Calamy, she\r\nthought--who had occasion to go to a market-town in Devonshire, and take\r\na lodging there whilst the assizes were going on. In the evening a\r\nservant came to his room and said that the master of the house hoped\r\nthat he would do him the honour of coming down to supper with him. He\r\nsaid, ‘Oh, pray thank him very much, but say that I never take supper.’\r\nBut the servant came three times with the same message, and at last he\r\nsaid to himself, ‘Well, he seems so anxious to have me that it is rather\r\nchurlish not to go,’ and he went. There were many people in the room,\r\nquite a number of guests, and a great supper prepared. But, being a\r\nreligious man, before sitting down he said grace aloud, and, as he said\r\nit, the whole thing vanished.\r\n\r\n“Archbishop Benson told Lady Alwyn that two Americans were talking to\r\neach other about spiritualism. Said one to the other, ‘You do not\r\nbelieve in ghosts, do you?’--‘No, certainly not!’ ‘You would not believe\r\neven if you saw one?’--‘No, certainly not.’ ‘Well, I am one!’ and he\r\nvanished on the spot.\r\n\r\n“Afterwards I saw Higham Ferrers on my way to stay at Ecton, such a\r\npleasant old house; and the next week I was with the George Drummonds at\r\nSwaylands, which has the finest rock-garden in England, and drew with\r\nMiss Henniker in the delicious old gardens of Penshurst Place.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ HUGH BRYAN _and_ JOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Castle Hale, Painswick, June 17._--‘Voici venir les longs crépuscules\r\nde juin,’[579] and I will employ one of them in writing to you. I have\r\nhad a Whitsuntide of visits, beginning with the Deanery of Hereford.\r\nMrs. Leigh[580] was full of her visit to Butler’s Island, from which she\r\nwas lately returned--her last visit, she thinks, but I expect she will\r\nnot long be able to keep away from the old home in the rice-swamps which\r\nshe loves so dearly. Before she left, she had a little feast for all the\r\nolder negroes, who had been slaves, and whose ancestors had been on the\r\nplace since her great-grandfather’s time. She thanked them for coming in\r\na little speech, expressing her attachment to them, but saying that as\r\nher years were advancing, she might not meet them often again on earth,\r\nbut that she trusted to see them again hereafter. She was much moved\r\nherself, and many of the negroes wept; then, as by a universal impulse,\r\nthey all sprang up and sang the Doxology! Her daughter Alice had a\r\nsupper for the younger negroes in another room. One of them, a young\r\nman, made a speech, and ended it by saying, ‘I am sure that this\r\nfestival will be remembered by our offspring long after their forespring\r\nare dead and gone.’\r\n\r\n“‘Old Sie is my foreman,’ said Mrs. Leigh. ‘His grandfather lived with\r\nmy great-grandfather, the first of our family who established himself on\r\nButler’s Island. He was a very clever, efficient slave. Once, when all\r\nthe other slaves were out at another island trying to cultivate it--it\r\nis called “Experiment” still--there came on one of those tremendous\r\nhurricanes which are, happily, very rare with us. The slaves, who are\r\nlike sheep, all wanted at once to take to the boats and get home. Had\r\nthey succeeded in embarking, they would all have been lost, as many\r\nother negroes were then, when all boats were swamped. But, at the point\r\nof the whip, Sie’s grandfather drove them all back inland to a hut where\r\nthey could take refuge. Afterwards Sie was offered his freedom, but he\r\nwould not take it; so my grandfather had a silver cup made for him, with\r\nan inscription recording what he had done. Last winter I said to Sie, “I\r\nthink you had better let me buy that cup from you; you are all free now,\r\nand your children are not likely to care for it.” He considered awhile,\r\nthen he said, “No, Missus, I tink not: I keep cup;” and then he thought\r\na little more and said, “Missus, when I be gone done dead, you have de\r\ncup.”’\r\n\r\n“I went with the Leighs to see the wonderful old church of ‘Abbeydore in\r\nthe Golden Valley,’ as romantic as its name, and Kilpeck, a marvellous\r\nold Norman building.\r\n\r\n“I went next to Madresfield, a first visit in a new reign, and very\r\ndifferent it looked in its long grass and flowers, with the lovely\r\nMalvern hills behind, from the frost-bound place I remember. Its young\r\nmaster has spent all the time of his possession in beautifying it,\r\nplanting glorious masses of peonies, iris, and a thousand other flowers\r\nin the grass, and making a herbaceous walk--winding--with a background\r\nof yew hedge, which is a very dream of loveliness. I was very happy at\r\nMadresfield, liking Beauchamp and Lady Mary so much, and all the many\r\nguests were charming, especially the Arthur Walronds, genial Dick\r\nSomerset, delightful Lady Northcote, the evergreen Duchess of\r\nCleveland--‘Aunt Wilhelmine’--and three pleasant young men, Charlie\r\nHarris, Victor Cochran, and Lord Jedburgh. What a pleasure there is in\r\nthoroughly well-bred society! There is a capital passage in Ouida’s last\r\nbook about this--‘You are always telling me that I wear my clothes too\r\nlong: you’ve often seen me in an old coat--a shockingly old coat; but\r\nyou never saw me in an ill-cut one. Well, I like my acquaintance to be\r\nlike my clothes. They may be out at elbows, but I must have ’em well\r\ncut.’\r\n\r\n“One afternoon we drove to Eastnor, which was in great beauty, and the\r\ncastle--hideous outside--a palace of art treasures within, infinitely\r\nlovely from the flowers with which Lady Henry Somerset fills it.\r\n\r\n“But most I liked the rambles about the inexhaustible gardens of\r\nMadresfield itself, with my charming young host and hostess, and one or\r\nother of the guests, and the practice inculcated by the oft-repeated\r\nquestions which they ask so cheerily--‘Is it wise? is it kind? is it\r\ntrue?’ the very thought of which stops so much scandal; yet one has to\r\nconsider all the three questions together, for the last would so often\r\nbring an affirmative where there would be a negative for the two others.\r\nThe house itself is full of interesting and precious things, old\r\nfurniture, miniatures, enamels, &c.\r\n\r\n“Now I am with Mrs. Baddeley, whom you will remember as Helen Grant,\r\nthe second of the three beautiful sisters whom all the great artists\r\nwanted to paint, but who have been such dear friends of mine from their\r\nearliest childhood, and often at Holmhurst, whether I were there or not.\r\nHelen’s husband, St. Clair Baddeley, is full of amusing stories, and his\r\nadopted father, Mr. Christie, with whom they live, is the dearest of old\r\ngentlemen. Just behind this house is the old courthouse where Charles I.\r\nlodged in most troublous times, and whence he fled. Many of his\r\nCavaliers took refuge in the church, and numbers of them were afterwards\r\nshot in the churchyard, where old helmets are still dug up, and where a\r\nrow of yews are said to mark their graves. There are ninety-nine yews\r\naltogether, and it is said that a mystic power guards this number; if\r\nany one tries to plant more, the old yews destroy them. In their shadow\r\nare a number of fine tombs, executed by Italian workmen, who left the\r\nplace because they were not allowed to have their own chapel, but who\r\nwere brought over when Painswick was a very flourishing town from its\r\ncloth factories, now transferred to Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n“Just before her marriage, H. went to see Lady Burton at Mortlake, and\r\nwas taken to Burton’s mausoleum as a natural part of her visit.\r\nAfterwards Lady Burton wrote to her saying that she wanted to ask a very\r\ngreat favour. It was that she would never wear again the hat in which\r\nshe had come down to Mortlake. H. liked her hat very much--a pretty\r\nParis hat in which she fancied herself particularly, but she said she\r\nwould do as an old friend of her future husband wished, though utterly\r\nmystified. Afterwards Lady Burton wrote that when H. had come into the\r\nroom on her visit, she was horrified to see three black roses in her\r\nhat; that they were the mark of a most terrible secret sect in Arabia,\r\nmixed up in every possible atrocity, and that--especially as worn by a\r\ngirl about to be married--they were a presage of every kind of\r\nmisfortune; that, in another case of the same kind, she had given the\r\nsame warning, and the girl, who disregarded it, died on the day before\r\nher wedding. H. wore her hat again, but took out the black roses.\r\n\r\n“Sir Richard Burton died of syncope of the heart--died twenty minutes\r\nbefore Lady Burton’s priest could arrive; so her report of his having\r\nbeen received into the Roman Catholic Church was a complete delusion.\r\n\r\n“H. says that Count Herbert Bismarck went lately to a great function in\r\nRussia. While he wished to be incognito, he still did not see why he\r\ncould not have the advantages of his cognito. ‘Stand back; you must keep\r\nthe line,’ said an official as he was pushing through. ‘You do not know\r\nwho I am: I am Count Herbert Bismarck.’ ‘Really? Well that quite\r\n_explains_, but it does not _excuse_ your conduct,’ rejoined the\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\n“At the silver wedding of the Prince and Princess of Wales, a northern\r\ntown wished to present an address, but there was a great discussion as\r\nto its wording; for some time they could not agree at all. ‘Conscious as\r\nwe are of our own unworthiness,’ was universally condemned, but when\r\nsome one proposed, ‘Conscious as we are of each other’s unworthiness,’\r\nit was agreed to to a man.\r\n\r\n“Mr. P----, Q.C., who has just been here, has called to mind that the\r\nQueen’s name is neither Victoria nor Guelf. Her real name is Victorina\r\nWetting (pronounced Vettine). She was christened Victorina, and then\r\nthere was a little girl called Victorina who played a most unpleasant\r\npart in Queen Caroline’s trial, and the Duke and Duchess of Kent changed\r\ntheir child’s name to Victoria, that it might not be the same. And\r\nWetting is her husband’s--the real Saxe-Coburg name.\r\n\r\n“H. had been at Oxford when Max Müller one day received a letter which\r\npleased him so much that he insisted on sending a very nice letter in\r\nreturn, though it was evidently only written to get an autograph. It\r\nasked if there was any reason, other than coincidence, for _meche_ and\r\n_mechant_: wick, wicked. One day an American was shown in to Max Müller,\r\nsaying, ‘I have come, sir, four thousand miles to see you,’ &c. The\r\nprofessor was terribly pressed for time, and bored too; but as to the\r\nlatter, felt that in a quarter of an hour he would be released, as he\r\nhad a lecture to deliver. So he was civil, and then excused himself,\r\nsaying that he was afraid he must go to his lecture, but that if his\r\nvisitor wished to go to hear it, he could. ‘No,’ said the American, ‘I\r\nwill not go with you, for I am rather deaf; but I can make myself\r\nperfectly happy here, and you shall find me here on your return.”\r\n\r\n“St. Clair has been talking of Mrs. Procter, whom he knew well, and how\r\nshe used to say, ‘Never tell anybody how you are, because nobody wants\r\nto know.’ All her circle are gone now, Lowell, Matthew Arnold, Browning,\r\nAdelaide Sartoris. When she was dying, her nun-daughter came and tried\r\nto get a priest in, but she would not have it. She had preserved the\r\nletters of Thackeray, Dickens, and others in three tin boxes. Mrs.\r\nProcter left Browning and two others her executors, but the nun wanted\r\nall the papers to be given to a young Nottingham doctor, to be published\r\njust as she wished, and, when they would not have it so, she put the\r\nwhole of the correspondence on the kitchen-fire: it was her vendetta on\r\nher mother for having refused the priest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To the_ COUNTESS OF DARNLEY.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, June 29, 1897._--I said I would tell you about the Jubilee.\r\nFor the first few days I was with the hospitable Lowthers, and thence,\r\non Sunday, went to the Thanksgiving service at St. Paul’s. Going very\r\nearly, I had perhaps the best place in the choir, and enjoyed seeing the\r\ngradual gathering of so much of the bravery, learning, and beauty of\r\nEngland beneath the dusky arches and glistening mosaics. When the long\r\nfile of clergy went out to meet the royal procession at the west door,\r\nthe faint distant song was very lovely, gradually swelling, and lost in\r\nthe blare of trumpets, the roll of drums, and the triumphant shout of\r\nwelcoming voices as the clergy re-entered the choir. The most important\r\nfigure was the Bishop of Finland in a white satin train with two\r\ngorgeous train-bearers; but the newspapers tell this, and how the lines\r\nof royal persons sate on crimson chairs opposite the entrance of the\r\nchoir, and how the Bishop of London preached touchingly, not effusively,\r\nabout the Queen and her reign, and officiated at the altar in a gorgeous\r\nmitre and cope.\r\n\r\n“On Monday Miss Lowther and I went to tea with my friend (minor-canon)\r\nLewis Gilbertson at his lovely little house in Amen Court, and then were\r\ntaken, by one of the many secret staircases of the cathedral, to emerge\r\nover the portico for the rehearsal of the next day’s ceremony. Perhaps,\r\nin some ways, this was more impressive than the reality, as none of the\r\nvast surrounding space was kept clear; all was one sea of heads, whilst\r\nevery window, every house-top, even every chimney-pot, was crowded with\r\npeople. Never was anything more jubilant than the ‘Te Deum,’ more\r\nreverent than the solemn Lord’s Prayer in the open air--every hat off.\r\nWhen the appointed programme was over, the crowd very naturally asked\r\nfor ‘God save the Queen,’ and after some hesitation, and goings to and\r\nfro of dean and canons, it was begun by the bands and choristers, and\r\ntaken up vigorously by the mile of people as far as Temple Bar. How\r\ngrand it was!\r\n\r\n“That evening the dear Queen said to Miss ... ‘To-morrow will be a\r\n_very_ happy day for me;’ and I think it must have been. Where are\r\nanarchists and socialists before such a universal burst of loyalty--not\r\nof respect only, but of heartfelt filial _love_?--Nowhere! Their very\r\nexistence seems ridiculous. I saw all from the Beaumonts’ in Piccadilly\r\nTerrace, where a most kind hostess managed all most beautifully for us,\r\nand, entering through the garden, we had neither heat nor crowd to fear.\r\nNo small part of the sight was the crowd itself--the unfailing\r\ngood-humour increased by the extreme kindness of the police towards\r\nfainting women and all who needed their help. The Colonial procession\r\nwas charming--its young representatives rode so well, and were in\r\nthemselves such splendid specimens of humanity, and so picturesquely\r\nequipped. Then the group of old English generals on horseback drew every\r\neye, and the sixteen carriages of princesses, amongst whom the Duchess\r\nof Teck was far more cheered than any one except the Queen herself. And\r\nlastly came the cream-coloured horses with their golden-coated footmen,\r\nand the beloved Lady herself--the ‘Mother of the Land,’--every inch a\r\nqueen, royal most exceedingly, but with an expression of such love, such\r\ngratitude, such devotion, such thankfulness! Oh, no one felt for and\r\n_with_ her only as a sovereign; it was a far closer tie than that.\r\n\r\n“In the evening, Mrs. Tilt and her sister went with me to the\r\nMaxwell-Lytes on the top of the Record Tower, whence we saw the bonfires\r\nround London light up one by one, and St. Paul’s in silver light--a\r\nglorified spiritual church rising out of the darkness of the city\r\nagainst the deep blue sky. Far more than the illuminations of the noisy\r\nstreets, it was a fitting end to so solemn and momentous a day.\r\n\r\n“And on Wednesday I was in the Green Park, and heard the thousands of\r\nschool-children sing their farewell to the Queen as she went away to\r\nWindsor.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MRS. C VAUGHAN.\r\n\r\n“_March 1897._--I think the reviews of the first three volumes of my\r\n‘Story’ must be coming to an end now. I have had them all sent to me,\r\nand very amusing they have been, mostly recalling the dictum of\r\nDisraeli, that ‘critics are those who have failed in art and\r\nliterature.’ Many criticisms have been kind. One or two, but not more,\r\nhave been rather clever, and some of the fault-finding ones would have\r\nbeen very instructive if I had not so entirely agreed with them at the\r\noutset on all their main points--that I was a mere nobody, that my life\r\nwas wholly without importance, and that it was shocking to see parts of\r\nthe story in print, especially the painful episode which I called ‘The\r\nRoman Catholic Conspiracy;’ for reviewers, of course, could not know the\r\nanguish it cost when I was led to publish that chapter, by its being my\r\n_one_ chance of giving the true version of a story of which so many\r\nfalse versions had been given already. However, it is as Zola says,\r\n‘Every author must, at the outset, swallow his toad,’ _i.e._, some\r\nmalicious attack in the periodicals of the day; only I think my toads\r\nbecome more numerous and venomous as years go on.\r\n\r\n“Some of the reviews are very funny indeed. The _Saturday Review_ of ‘A\r\nMonument of Self-Sufficiency’ contrives to read (oh! where?) ‘how sweet\r\nand amenable and clever Augustus was,’ but is so shocked by a book\r\n‘wholly without delicacy’ that it--‘cannot promise to read any more of\r\nit’!! The _British Review_, which thinks me an absolute beast, has a\r\nstirring article on ‘Myself in Three Volumes.’ The _Pall Mall Gazette_\r\ndwells upon their ‘bedside sentiment and goody-goody twaddle,’ and is\r\n‘filled with genuine pity for a man who can attach importance to a life\r\nso trivial.’ The _Athenæum_ describes me as a mere ‘literary valet.’\r\nThe _New York Tribune_ finds the book ‘the continuous wail of a very\r\ngarrulous person.’ The reviewer in the _Bookbuyer_ speaks of the\r\n‘irritation and occasional fierce anger’ which the book arouses in\r\nhim(!). The _New York Independent_ dwells upon my ‘want not only of all\r\nkindly sense of humour, but also of propriety.’ It is long since the\r\n_National Observer_ has met with an author ‘so garrulous or so\r\nself-complacent.’ Finally, the _Allahabad Pioneer_ (what a name!) votes\r\nthat Mr. Hare’s chatter is ‘becoming a prodigious nuisance,’ and ‘if it\r\nhad its deserts his book would make its way, and pretty quickly, to the\r\npastry-cook and the trunk-maker.’\r\n\r\n“What fun! Yet I am glad that most of the more respectable reviews say\r\nexactly the opposite, and certainly the public does not seem to agree\r\nwith those I have quoted; it would be terribly expensive if it did. They\r\nare only birds of prey with their beaks cut and their claws pulled out,\r\nand if a book is found to be interesting, people read it whatever they\r\nsay. They influence nobody, except just at first those who choose books\r\nfor lending libraries.\r\n\r\n“What is really almost irritating is the very ragtag and bobtail of\r\nreviews, whose writers can scarcely even glance at the books they are\r\npenny-a-lining--such as the _Table_, which ‘explains’ that ‘my\r\ngrandmother was the wife of Archdeacon Hare;’ as another (I have lost it\r\nnow) which speaks of ‘Priscilla Maurice, second wife of Julius Hare;’ as\r\nthe _Weekly Register_, which reviews the life of ‘Esmeralda,’ or the\r\nstudent of the book who writes in _The Dial_ and describes my life at\r\n‘Balliol College,’ or _Household Words_ (copied by the _Free-thinker_\r\nand several other even inferior reviews), which ‘quotes’ in full a long\r\nstory about Mr. Gladstone and Father Healy which is not to be found in\r\nthe ‘Story’ at all.\r\n\r\n“Then, did you see Mr. Murray’s letter to the _Times_, which certainly\r\ngives a touching picture of the spirit of self-sacrifice which actuates\r\npublishers in their daily life, for he announces that my ‘Handbook of\r\nBerks, Bucks, and Oxon,’ which had three editions before his father’s\r\ndeath, and on which the author was only paid _altogether_ £152, left, at\r\nthat death, a deficit of £158!! I was sorry, all the same, that he was\r\nannoyed at my description of his father wrapt in his _enveloppe de\r\nglace_; for old Mr. Murray (who had cut me dead for all the years since\r\nthe appearance of my Italian Handbooks) asked me to shake hands with him\r\nonce again a few months before he died, which I did most cordially.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ FRANCIS COOKSON.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, August 29, 1897._-- ...With me, life has rippled on through\r\nseveral months, only I have been away for some days with the Lowthers to\r\ndraw under Carlandi, and quite lately I have sorrowed bitterly at the\r\nearly death of my dear Inverurie, kindest and most affectionate of young\r\nfriends. I feel his being taken so much myself that I cannot bear even\r\nto think of what it must be to his nearest belongings; and yet--while\r\nabsolutely free from all humbug--surely never was there any young man\r\nmore simply and trustfully prepared for an early death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE WALPOLE CORRIDOR, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n“He cared less for ‘the world’ than any young fellow I have ever known,\r\nand was more in love with his family, his homes, and their surroundings.\r\n\r\n    ‘Felix ille animi, divisque simillimus ipsis.\r\n     Quem non mordaci resplendens gloria fuco\r\n     Sollicitat, non fastosi mala gaudia luxus\r\n     Sed tacitos sinit ire dies et paupere cultu\r\n     Exegit innocuae tranquilla silentia vitae.’[581]\r\n\r\n“Last week I was for three nights at Hurstmonceaux, actually--for the\r\nfirst time in thirty-seven years--at my old home of Lime. What a mixture\r\nof emotions it was; but within all is so changed, I could not recall my\r\nmother and Lea there; and the present inhabitants, the young Baron and\r\nBaroness von Roemer, were boundlessly good to me. Outside, there were\r\nmany spots alive with old memories, especially in the garden, where my\r\nmother and I lived so much alone--our earthly Paradise. Did you know\r\nthat the word Paradeisos means a garden?\r\n\r\n“How I should like you to know the peculiar surroundings of Lime,\r\ndifferent to those of any other place I have seen--the brown parched\r\nsun-dried uplands, the bosky ferny hollows, the reedy pools fragrant\r\nwith mint, the eternal variety of pink lights and grey shadows on the\r\nsoft downs beyond the wide Levels, which recall O’Hara’s lines--\r\n\r\n    ‘Where the herds are slowly winding over leagues of waving grass,\r\n     And the wild cranes seek the sedges, and the wild swans homeward pass.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WARBLETON PRIORY, ON APPROACHING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WARBLETON PRIORY, SEEN FROM BEHIND.]\r\n\r\n“We made a little excursion. In my very early childhood I was once at\r\nthe ever-haunted Warbleton Priory, and the recollection of its utter\r\nweirdness and of the skulls kept there had always so remained with me\r\nthat I had quite longed to see it again. The many stories about it are\r\nsuch as ought never to be told, only whispered. The very approaches have\r\na mystery. No one will stay there now, even by broadest daylight; so we\r\nwent to an old manor near Rushlake Green for the keys, but found even\r\nthat so bolted and barred that we were long in obtaining them. ‘Oh no,\r\nthere is never any one there,’ said the servant, ‘but you must go on\r\ntill you come to a black gate, then drive in.’ To reach this, we\r\nfollowed a lane with well-built cottages, but they were deserted, their\r\nwindows broken and their gardens overgrown; no one could live so near\r\nthe accursed spot. Through the black gate we enter dark woods. A\r\ncart-track exists, winding through thickets with fine oaks interspersed,\r\nand by reedy ponds dense with waving cotton-plants. Then we cross open\r\nfields entirely covered with thistles--enough to seed all Sussex--for no\r\none will work there. Then, through another black gate, we enter a\r\nturf-grown space, with lovely distant view between old trees, and\r\nthere, with high red-tiled roofs, golden here and there with lichen, is\r\na forlorn and mossy but handsome old stone house, built from and rising\r\namidst other remains of an Augustinian priory. In its little garden are\r\nroses, and box bushes which have once been clipped into shapes. Inside,\r\nthe mildewed rooms have some scanty remnants of their old furniture. In\r\none of them, where a most terrible murder was committed, the blood then\r\nshed still comes up through the floor--a dark awful pool which no\r\ncarpenter’s work can efface. The most frightful sounds, cries, and\r\nshrieks of anguish, rumblings and clankings, even apparently explosions,\r\nare always heard by night, and sometimes by day. In the principal room\r\nof the ground floor, in the recess of a window, are two skulls. They\r\nare believed to be those of two brothers who fought here and both fell\r\ndead. From one, the lower jaw has fallen down, increasing its ghastly\r\neffect. Successive generations of farmers have buried them, and\r\ninstantly everything has gone wrong on the farm and all the cattle have\r\ndied: now they have altogether abandoned a hopeless struggle with the\r\nunseen world. Besides this there is a tradition--often verified--that if\r\nany one touches the skulls, within twelve hours they pass through the\r\nvalley of the shadow of Death. So naturally Warbleton Priory is left to\r\nthe undisputed possession of its demon-ghosts.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL _and_ LETTER _to_ W. H. MILLIGAN.\r\n\r\n“_Thoresby, Oct. 22, 1897._--I began my little tour of visits at Maiden\r\nBradley.... You know how it is almost the only remnant the title\r\npossesses from the once vast Somerset estates. The 12th Duke left\r\neverything he possibly could away, and when the present Duke and Duchess\r\nsucceeded, they were pictureless, bookless, almost spoonless. Still they\r\nwere determined to make the best of it. ‘He could not take away our\r\nfuture: we will not lament over all that is lost, but enjoy to the very\r\nutmost what we have;’ this has been the rule of their existence, and so\r\n‘Algie and Susie,’ as they, always speak of each other, have had a most\r\ndelightful life, enjoying and giving enjoyment. No one ever looked more\r\nducal than this genial, hearty, handsome Duke: no one brighter or\r\npleasanter than his Duchess: ‘all who have to do with her find nothing\r\nbut courtesy, gentleness, and goodness,’ as Brantôme wrote of Claude of\r\nFrance. I liked my visit extremely. My fellow-guests were Sir E. Poynter\r\nof the Royal Academy, Lady Heytesbury, and Mrs. Kelly, an authoress.\r\nWith the last I saw stately Longleat, which I had not visited since I\r\nwas fourteen, and--as horses are the one indulgence the Duke gives\r\nhimself--he drove us luxuriously about the country on his\r\ncoach-and-four.\r\n\r\n“The following week was delightful--with the Boynes in their beautiful\r\nhill-set home. They took me glorious excursions, and we picnicked out in\r\nbeautiful places five days running. One day we went to Kinlet--a really\r\ngreat house, as well kept by Swedish maids (its mistress is a Swede) as\r\nif there were a dozen men-servants. And the last day we went to a real\r\nstill-standing Norman farmhouse (Millichope), with its original round\r\narched doors and windows.\r\n\r\n“From Burwarton I went on to my pleasant cousin’s, the Francis\r\nBridgemans, close to that beautiful church at Tong, and we spent a day\r\nwith Francis’s kind old father, Lord Bradford, at Weston, and he showed\r\nus all the pictures and treasures in the house, and drove us about in\r\nhis sociable to the ‘Temple of Diana’ and other points of interest in\r\nthe park of a very comfortable well-to-do place.\r\n\r\n“Next, I visited Lady Margaret Herbert (daughter of my dear Lady\r\nCarnarvon) as châtelaine at Teversal manor in Notts, a smoky\r\nwind-stricken country, but with Hardwicke and other fine houses to see.\r\nThe charming aunt of my hostess, Lady Guendolen, was living with her as\r\nchaperon, none the worse in body for being a strict vegetarian, and in\r\nmind the sunniest of the sunny, delightful to be with.\r\n\r\n    ‘And scarcely is she altered, for the hours\r\n     Have led her lightly down the vale of life,\r\n     Dancing and scattering roses, and her face\r\n     Seems a perpetual daybreak.’[582]\r\n\r\nI was glad to be taken to spend the day at Bestwood, the Duke of St.\r\nAlban’s modern place, its woods an oasis in the wilderness, and its\r\nhonours were charmingly done by Lady Sybil Beauclerk and her\r\ngood-looking brother Burford. In the Duchess’s room were a series of\r\nalbums with all the original drawings for Dickens’s works. All the best\r\npictures were burnt in a fire.\r\n\r\n“The Ladies Herbert sometimes, but in a far-away sense, remind me of\r\ntheir mother, who was quite the most perfectly brilliant person I have\r\never known. I have always heard that she was this even as a girl, and\r\nthat it was a perpetual surprise to her parents, who were very inferior\r\npeople. Lady Dufferin used to say that they were like savages who had\r\nfound a watch.\r\n\r\n“Taking stern dismal Bolsover--its delicate carvings utterly ruined by\r\n‘trippers’--on the way, I came on to meet a large party here at\r\nThoresby, which is in more than usual autumnal forest glory. We have\r\njust been spending the afternoon at Welbeck, shown all the improvements\r\nby Mrs. Dallas Yorke, in the absence of the tall handsome Duchess, who,\r\nhowever, returned before we left. One did not wonder that she is such a\r\nspecial joy to the old people of the place, because they had ‘been so\r\nlong without a duchess, and when there was one long ago, it was only\r\nsuch a little one.’ She has built a delightful\r\ngallery--Florence-fashion--between the old house and the new, and hung\r\nit with a galaxy of old prints, and has made fascinating little\r\nterrace-gardens, and edged their beds with dwarf lavender, so that ‘when\r\nthe ladies’ dresses brush against it, its scent may be wafted into the\r\nhouse.’\r\n\r\n“And meantime my thoughts have been much at Llandaff, with the\r\ncousin[583] who was the dearest friend of my boyhood, seeming to pass\r\nwith her through the closing scenes of the good Dean’s life, and to see\r\nhim as she did, lying in his cathedral, dressed in his surplice, in the\r\nmajesty of eternal repose.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MRS. C. VAUGHAN.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Nov. 16, 1897._--Here I am again in quietude, thinking of\r\nyou very much in your last days at Llandaff; busy over the building of\r\nwhich I am architect, overseer, a hundred things at once, and planting a\r\ngreat deal, with a reminiscence of Dumbiedykes in Walter Scott--‘Be aye\r\nsticking in a tree; it will be growing, Jock, while you’re sleeping.’ My\r\nonly companions now are the pleasant Hospitallers in the little Hospice,\r\nwhom I constantly meet in the garden and wood walks. I wish you could\r\nsee their little house, and the late roses lingering on their porch.\r\n\r\n“I have been away for a week. Lady Stanhope took me from Chevening to\r\nsee Lullingstone Castle in Kent, the old house of the Dykes, with a\r\ngood brick gateway, a richly ceilinged upper gallery, and a chapel with\r\ninteresting tombs. Two days afterwards, Lady Chetwynd took me to a finer\r\nplace--Chawton in Hants, where the Knights, of Godmersham, live now,\r\nrepresenting several old extinct families, especially the Lewknors, with\r\nwhom I am very familiar through their tombs scattered all over Sussex,\r\nand who are commemorated at Chawton by many portraits and fine\r\ntapestried needlework. A little bookcase with a globe outside and a\r\nseries of Elzevir Histories of the World within, was very attractive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORCH OF HOSPICE, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n“Then I went to stay with ‘the richest man in the world,’ genial\r\nunassuming Mr. Astor, in his beautiful Cliveden, much improved since he\r\nbought it from its ducal owners, and enriched within by glorious\r\nportraits of Reynolds and Romney, and without by the noble terrace\r\nparapet of the Villa Borghese and its fountains, already looking here a\r\nnatural part of the Buckinghamshire landscape, and replaced on its old\r\nsite by a copy, which is just the same to nineteenth-century Italians!\r\nAll the splendid sarcophagi and even the marble benches of the\r\nworld-famous villa are now also at Cliveden, where they are more valued\r\nthan at Rome. We had a charming party--Jane, Lady Churchill, retaining\r\nin advancing years ‘sa marche de déesse sur les nues,’[584] for which\r\nshe was famous in her youth; the Lord Chancellor, Lady Halsbury, and a\r\ndaughter; pretty gentle Princess Löwenstein; the Duchess of Roxburghe,\r\never wreathed in smiles of geniality and kindness, with two very tall\r\nagreeable daughters; Lord Sandwich, as bubbling with fun as when he was\r\na young man; Lord and Lady Stanhope--always salt of the earth; with Mr.\r\nMarshall Hall and Sir Arthur Sullivan as geniuses; so, as you will see,\r\n‘une élite très intelligente.’ Every one of these delightful people,\r\ntoo, was simplicity itself, rare as that virtue is to find. I see that\r\nQueen Adelaide, as Duchess of Clarence, wrote to Gabrielle von\r\nBülow--‘How rarely you meet a really simple man or woman in our great\r\nworld; they would be hard to find even with Diogenes’ lantern.’\r\nCertainly ‘learned’ people are scarcely ever agreeable. There is a very\r\ngood sentence in Hamerton about that--‘A good mental condition includes\r\njust as much culture as is necessary to the development of the\r\nfaculties, but not any burden of erudition heavy enough to diminish, as\r\nerudition so often does, the promptitude or elasticity of the mind.’\r\n\r\n“On Sunday morning we all went to the beautifully situated little church\r\nat Hedsor, arriving early and seeing the congregation wind up the steep\r\ngrassy hill as to a church in Dalecarlia. In the afternoon we were\r\ndriven about the grounds of Cliveden to the principal points--Waldo\r\nStory’s grand fountain in the avenue and his noble landing-place on the\r\nriver. Exquisitely beautiful were the peace of the still autumn evening,\r\nthe amber and golden tints of the woods, and the wide river with its\r\nreflections. Mr. Astor has attended to all the historic associations of\r\nthe spot; placing a fine statue of Marlborough in the temple built by\r\nLord Orkney, who was one of his generals, and portraits of Lady\r\nShrewsbury and her Duke of Buckingham, and of Frederick and Augusta of\r\nWales, in the successor of the house where they lived. Another portrait\r\nof Frederick, with his three sisters, Anne, Emily, and Caroline, all\r\nplaying on musical instruments, has the old house in the background. Our\r\nhost seemed to me quite absolutely frank and delightful; indeed,\r\nSurrey’s lines on Sir T. Wyatt might be applied to him--\r\n\r\n    ‘An eye whose judgment no effect could blind,\r\n     Friends to allure and foes to reconcile,\r\n     Whose piercing look did represent a mind\r\n     With virtue fraught, reposèd, void of guile.’\r\n\r\n“Now, I am enjoying the time alone at home, with its much-reading\r\nopportunity, and I often think that my natural bent would have been to\r\nenjoy it quite as much as a boy, when all the family except you treated\r\nme not only as a consummate dunce, but a _hopeless_ dunce; and when\r\nalmost every book was thought wicked, or at best quite unsuited for a\r\nboy’s digestion. Now, eyes ache often, but I may say with Lady M.\r\nWortley Montagu, ‘If relays of eyes were to be ordered like post-horses,\r\nI would admit none but silent companions.’\r\n\r\n“Les années d’ennui et de solitude lui firent lire bien des\r\nlivres’--part of Catherine II.’s epitaph on herself--is certainly true\r\nin my case. Just now I have been labouring through the two long thick\r\nvolumes which are called ‘Memoirs of Tennyson,’ though, when you close\r\nthem, you have less idea of what the man was like than when you\r\nbegan--of the rude, rugged old egotist, who was yet almost sublimely\r\npicturesque; of the aged sage, who in dress, language, manners was\r\nalways posing for the adoration of strangers, and furious if he did not\r\nget it, or--if he did. The book is most provoking, for it would by no\r\nmeans have destroyed the hero to have truthfully described the man.\r\n\r\n“There have been no end of hard-worked boy-friends here for Sundays, and\r\nit is no trouble, but very much the contrary. We always get on together\r\ncapitally--\r\n\r\n    ‘That which we like, likes us:\r\n     No need of any fuss,’\r\n\r\nis a capital Feejee proverb.[585]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AVE-VALE STEPS, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n“I think it is Frederick Locker who says that one gradually finds out\r\nhow much of the affection one inspires is ‘_reflected_.’ ‘Though thou\r\nlose all that thou deemest happiness, if thou canst but make the\r\nhappiness of others, thou shall find it again in thine own heart,’ is a\r\nsentence of George Ebers, of which I mentally leave out as irrelevant\r\nthe conclusion--‘Is not this playing at being God Almighty?’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MISS GARDEN _at_ LUCCA, _and_ JOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, August 1, 1898._--I have been much in London since I wrote\r\nlast, enjoying the garden-parties at Sion, Osterley, Holland House,\r\nHatfield, Lady Penrhyn’s, Lady Portman’s, &c., and seeing many pleasant\r\npeople, mostly ‘grandes dames de par le monde.’ Yet, in the season, it\r\nis all too great a hurry; one seldom has time to become really\r\nacquainted with any one; there are few who have even sufficient\r\npersonality to leave an individual impression on the mind; if any one\r\ndoes, he or she is ‘like a tree in the steppe’ in the monotony of London\r\nlife. I dined out daily for two months, but how difficult it is to\r\nremember any dinner-party! ‘Who cares for the whipped cream of London\r\nsociety?’ was a saying of Walter Scott. I do recollect one dinner,\r\nhowever, at Mr. Knowles’s, from the fine effect of light on Leighton’s\r\n‘Clytie,’ the principal ornament of his dining-room, all the\r\nillumination being given to one fold of the dress, and the rest\r\neffectively left in shadow. One charming person whom I remember was Lady\r\nBlake, lately returned to England with her husband, who had been\r\ngovernor of Jamaica. She was fond of tame animals. ‘In Jamaica,’ she\r\nsaid, ‘I often had a large snake coiled round my waist; my tiger-cat I\r\ngenerally led by a string, for I never knew what he might do, but my\r\ntame crocodile always quietly followed me.’ She was Irish--a Bernal\r\nOsborne. ‘Oh, I assure you the Irish are very good to us, quite\r\ncharming, in fact.’ ‘But if you do anything they don’t like, they kill\r\nyou.’--‘Naturally.’\r\n\r\n“On July 11 I was at Miss Fleetwood Wilson’s wedding to Prince\r\nDolgorouki, and also at Lady Mary Savile’s in the Church of the\r\nAssumption, which was a most picturesque ceremony, performed by Cardinal\r\nVaughan--such a fine cardinal!--in a jewelled mitre, with all\r\naccompaniments of cross-bearers, incense-swingers, &c.\r\n\r\n“The nobly Christian death of Mr. Gladstone and the almost ludicrous\r\napotheosis of one who, in his political life, did nothing and undid so\r\nmuch, were events of the spring. I have personally more individual\r\nrecollection of his kindness to those who needed it than of his witty\r\nsayings; but they were constant. ‘What do you think of Purcell’s Life of\r\nManning?’ some one said to him shortly before the end. ‘I think that\r\nManning need have nothing to fear at the day of judgment.’ He was\r\nformidable to strangers, chiefly on account of ‘those demoniac eyes of\r\nhis,’ as Cardinal Alcander said of Luther; and though in his private\r\ncapacity he was all goodness, it seemed inconsistent with his public\r\none. Yet what admirers he had! I remember his saying once to Lord\r\nHoughton, ‘I lead the life of a dog,’ and the answer, ‘Yes, of a St.\r\nBernard--the saviour of men.’ Joseph Parker used to describe him as ‘the\r\ngreatest Englishman of the century, he was so massive, sincere, and\r\nmajestic. If he had had humour he would have been too good to live, but\r\neagles don’t laugh.’\r\n\r\n“How much and long people have talked of him, and now what a silence\r\nwill fall upon it all. An amusing breakfast at Mr. Leveson’s has just\r\nbeen recalled to me, where Lady Marian Alford said, ‘Gladstone really\r\nputs his foot in it so often, he is a perfect centipede.’ Directly\r\nafter, a wasp lighted on the breakfast-table and there was some question\r\nof killing it. ‘Oh, don’t; I can’t bear killing anything,’ cried Lady\r\nMarian. ‘What! not even a centipede?’ quietly said Lord Lyons, who was\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n“I was with Mrs. John Dundas at Holt in Wiltshire, where the little\r\nvillage once prospered exceedingly owing to its mineral spring. Ten\r\nsmart carriages used to wait round its fountain at once whilst their\r\nowners drank the waters, and a house is pointed out where some Duchess\r\nor other died. Then the fashion changed, and drainage was allowed to\r\nfilter into the spring, and Holt sank into obscurity.\r\n\r\n“We went to see Mr. Moseley, the admirable old Rector, who is\r\nhalf-paralysed. A farmer had been to him to ask whether he did not think\r\nhe might get his hay in on a Sunday afternoon, as the weather was likely\r\nto change, and he answered, ‘Certainly; it is God’s hay; save it by all\r\nmeans.’ How unlike most English priests, but how Christ-like--‘personne\r\nmoins prêtre que Jesus Christ.’ ‘From the fetters of spiritual\r\nnarrowness, Good Lord deliver us,’ is a petition which I feel more and\r\nmore ought to be added to the Litany.[586] Yet in many houses I visit I\r\nstill find much of the old Sabbath-bondage remaining, though certainly\r\nit is true that ‘we almost sigh with relief when we discover that even\r\nsaints can find monotony monotonous.’\r\n\r\n“There is a perfect cordon of drawable old manor-houses round Holt, and\r\nit is only two miles from Bradford-on-Avon, from which the great town in\r\nYorkshire was colonised, and which owes much of its foreign look to\r\nFrench refugees. Its houses rise high, tier above tier, on the hillside,\r\nblue-grey against the sky. Over the Avon is a beautiful bridge with a\r\nfine old bracketed mass-chapel, long used as a lock-up. A tiny Saxon\r\nchurch--the only real one probably in England--has been discovered\r\nwalled up into cottages; and there is a noble old ‘palace’ of the Dukes\r\nof Kingston standing in high-terraced gardens. Great Chalfield is a most\r\nlovely Tudor house, with an old chapel and moat. At South Wraxhall how I\r\nrecalled many visits from my miserable so-called tutors at Lyncombe, in\r\ndays of penury and starvation. How indefinite the misty future seemed in\r\nthe thinking-time which those long solitary rambles afforded, and how I\r\nlonged to penetrate it. At fifteen ‘j’ai trop voulu, des choses\r\ninfinies,’ but I was at a parting of the ways of life then, and I think\r\nI decided in those early days to try to do the best I could here, and\r\nleave the eternities and infinities--of which I heard so much more than\r\nof realities--to take care of themselves, for:--\r\n\r\n    ‘Though reason may at her own quarry fly,\r\n     Yet how can finite grasp infinity?’\r\n\r\n“But I am moralising too much and must return to my old houses, which\r\nwere full of smugglers formerly--‘moonrakers’ they called them in\r\nWiltshire, because many of the smuggled goods were concealed in the\r\nponds, and when the excisemen caught the smugglers extracting them at\r\nnight, and demanded what they were doing, they answered, ‘Oh, we are\r\nraking out the moon.’ I was working in Shropshire for some time after\r\nmy Wiltshire visit, inspecting almost every church and old house for my\r\nbook, and hospitably entertained by genial Fred Swete at Oswestry and\r\nthe Misses Windsor Clive at beautiful Oakly Park near Ludlow.\r\n\r\n“While in London I went for two days to Bulstrode, which the late Duke\r\nof Somerset left to his youngest daughter, Lady Guendolen Ramsden, who\r\nis the most charming of hostesses, but the place is disappointing--a\r\nvery large modern villa, only one room remaining of the old house where\r\nMrs. Delany lived so much with Margaret, Duchess of Portland, and\r\nnothing of that of Judge Jeffreys, which preceded it. It contains an\r\nearly portrait of Shakspeare, and a most grand Sir Joshua of a Mrs.\r\nWeddell. We dawdled most of the day in the verandah. Oh, the waste of\r\ntime in country-house visits; but Lady Guendolen had much that was\r\npleasant to tell of her mother, the witty (Sheridan) Duchess of\r\nSomerset. ‘She was once at a bazaar selling things, and a fat, burly,\r\nplethoric farmer asked her the price of something and she mentioned it.\r\nThe price seemed to him absurd. ‘Do you take me for the Prodigal,’ he\r\nsaid. ‘Oh, no,’ she replied; ‘I take you for the fatted calf.’ This made\r\nGraham Vivian, who was one of the party, recollect. ‘I was walking by\r\nthe Duchess’s donkey-chair, and suddenly the donkey brayed horribly.\r\n“Will he do it again?” said the Duchess. “Not unless he hears another,”\r\nanswered the donkey-boy. “Then mind _you_ don’t sneeze,” said the\r\nDuchess, turning to me.’\r\n\r\n“About Mr. L., who always speaks his mind, Lady Guendolen was very\r\namusing:--‘Mr. L. took me in to dinner, and I thought I was making\r\nmyself very agreeable to him, when he suddenly said--“Talk to your\r\nneighbour on the other side.” I felt humiliated, but I thought he\r\nfancied I couldn’t, so I did, and went on, and never spoke another word\r\nto Mr. L. I told him of it afterwards, that he had hurt me so much that\r\nI dreamt of it, and I told him my dream--that I said to him that I was\r\nconsidered to become very amusing after I had had two glasses of wine,\r\nand he answered, ‘_Then_, my dear lady, you must have been most\r\nuncommonly sober this evening.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ VISCOUNT HALIFAX.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, August 21, 1898._--I have been for three days at\r\nHurstmonceaux, doubly picturesque in the burnt turf of this hot summer,\r\nupon which the massy foliage of the trees is embossed as in Titian’s\r\nlandscapes. I always feel there, as nowhere else except in the views of\r\nthe Roman Campagna from the Alban Hills, the supreme beauty of looking\r\ndown upon vast stretches of flat pasture-land, reaching for ten miles or\r\nmore, and iridescent in its pink and blue cloud-shadows, with here and\r\nthere a ripple of delicate green in softest glamour of quivering light.\r\nEvery hour one sees it change--luminous with long lines of natural\r\nshadow, purple from drifting storm-clouds--\r\n\r\n    ‘Then at some angel evening after rain\r\n     Glowing like early Paradise again.’\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure now to be there, though life there is living amongst\r\nthe sepulchres. ‘La morte, l’estrema visitatrice,’[587] has come to all\r\nI knew, and the gravestones of most of them are _moss-grown_--not only\r\nof all the family of my childhood, but of all the neighbours, and all\r\nthat generation of poor people. How often there comes into one’s mind\r\nsomething like the lines often repeated in the cemetery of Port-Royal--\r\n\r\n    ‘Tous ces morts ont véçu, toi qui vis, tu mourras:\r\n     Ce jour terrible approche, et tu n’y penses pas.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE CHURCHYARD, HURSTMONCEAUX.]\r\n\r\n‘Ce n’est pas le temps qui passe, ce sont les hommes,’ was a saying of\r\nLouis Philippe. How different everything is to the time which\r\nHurstmonceaux recalls; all hurry now and energy and updoing, and then\r\nsuch an extreme quietude of intellectual pursuits, in which every\r\nuninitiated visitor was considered an unendurable bore, if, however\r\ninteresting he might be in himself, he did not fall in with the mutual\r\nadmiration society of which the Rectory was the axis. I remember how\r\nThomas Carlyle and Monckton Milnes, with his ‘gay and airy mind,’[588]\r\nwere amongst those so considered, for they had naturally their outside\r\nviews and intelligence, and the Rectory group never tried for a moment\r\nto penetrate ‘l’écorce exterieur de leur vie;’ and, while bristling with\r\nprejudices themselves, they always found much to be shocked at in every\r\noutside person they came across. It seemed oddly apropos in all the\r\nremembrance of the closed Hurstmonceaux life to read in Madame de\r\nMontagu--‘It is not a good thing for everybody to see each other every\r\nday and too closely; they risk becoming unconscious egoists, critics,\r\nrulers, or subjects, and exhaust themselves by revolving perpetually on\r\na tiny axis.’ Yet in many ways how much more really interesting the life\r\nwas then; how picturesque Uncle Julius’s enthusiasm, how pathetic his\r\npathos over the books which were his realities; how interesting the\r\nconversation, and how genial the courtesy of such constant visitors as\r\nBunsen and Landor, though the latter was such a perfect original,\r\n‘dressed in classical adorning,’ as Arthur Young said of some one; then\r\nhow unruffled my dearest mother’s temper, over which even Aunt Esther’s\r\n_strenuous_ exactions were powerless; and how ceaseless the flow of her\r\n_love_--not charity, as people use the word now--to the poor of the\r\ncottages in the hazel-fringed lanes around her, whose cares she made her\r\nown, more moved and stirred by the querulous mutterings of Mrs. Burchett\r\nor Mrs. Cornford than by the most important events of English politics\r\nor the world’s history. Certainly she had a wonderful power with the\r\npoor, and an influence which has never passed away, for she had the rare\r\nart of entering into and understanding all their feelings; and then,\r\nwhen with them, she always gave them her _whole_ attention. I feel that\r\nmy two books give very different ideas of what Hurstmonceaux was fifty\r\nyears ago, but both are quite true; only the ‘Memorials of a Quiet Life’\r\nis the inside, and the ‘Story of my Life’ the outside view. How much of\r\nlife, after sixty, consists in retrospect! It is, as Fanny Kemble says--\r\n\r\n    ‘Youth with swift feet walks onward in the way,\r\n       The land of joy lies all before his eyes;\r\n     Age, stumbling, lingers slower day by day,\r\n       Still looking back, for it behind him lies.’\r\n\r\nOne great difference of feeling older is that one is afraid to put off\r\ndoing anything. ‘By the street of By-and-by, you come to the house of\r\nNowhere,’ is an admirable Spanish proverb.\r\n\r\n“I have greatly enjoyed the vivid, charming, simple letters of Mary\r\nSibylla Holland--‘anche oggi si sente una dolcezza d’affetto a leggere\r\nquel libro.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ W. H. MILLIGAN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AVE-VALE GATE, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Sept. 29, 1898._--The building and changes here go on well,\r\nbut very slowly, a result of having the work done with my own stone, and\r\nas much as possible by the men of our village. I think all will look\r\nwell in the end. Not a chair or a book will be moved from the older part\r\nof the house, consecrated by my mother’s memory, but room will be given\r\nfor the many things connected with Esmeralda, which I bought back at Sir\r\nEdward Paul’s sale, and, if I survive her, for many precious pieces of\r\nfurniture, pictures, prints, and books from Norwich which Mrs. Vaughan\r\nsays that she has left me. Where you will remember a steep grass bank,\r\nthere is now a double stone terrace, with vases and obelisks, and\r\nluxuriant beds of brilliant flowers edged with stone, copied as a whole\r\nfrom the Italian Villa Lante near Viterbo. At the end are a staircase\r\nand gateway to the Solitude, the ‘Ave-Vale Gate,’ with ‘Ave’ on the\r\noutside and ‘Vale’ within. Cypresses are growing up beside it to enhance\r\nthe impression of Italy, which is further carried out in a widening\r\nstaircase from the centre of the terrace, with lead vases on the piers,\r\ncopied in design and proportions from one at the Villa Arson near Nice.\r\nJust now, in this hot noon-day, the gorgeous flowers against the stone\r\nparapet, and background of brown-green ilex and blue-green pine are\r\nreally very Italian, while below in the meadows all is as English as it\r\ncan be, the cows feeding in the rich grass, the heavy rounded masses of\r\noak foliage, and the misty sea asleep in the motionless heat. Nothing\r\nseems to move, except my little black Pomeranian spitz, Nero, frisking\r\nand barking at the butterflies. I am sure that much the happiest part of\r\nmy present life is that spent at home, though there is nothing to tell\r\nabout it--‘l’histoire ne se soucie pas des heureux.’\r\n\r\n“Emmie Penrhyn is here, whose visits are always an unusual pleasure to\r\nme, and who is one of the dearest relations I have left, partly because,\r\nmore than any one else, she has a distant likeness to my mother. She\r\nlives happily and most usefully at Richmond in a very little world, with\r\na weak body but an all-sufficing soul.\r\n\r\n“I have grieved so truly over the news of Ranulph Mostyn’s death in\r\nIndia, that I could not help writing to his mother. Yet I always\r\nhesitate about whether letters of condolence can be of any comfort, and\r\ncan only act upon the knowledge that I like myself to have them in any\r\ngreat sorrow. No Christian disquisitions, however: they always seem\r\nforced and unmeaning. ‘Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;’\r\nthat is somewhere in Shakspeare. Thirlwall’s Letters have an excellent\r\npassage about them--‘Expressions of general condolence may be welcome as\r\ntokens of goodwill, but can scarcely exert any general alleviating\r\npower. The afflicted ones stand within a circle of images and feelings\r\nof their own, which, painful as they may be, they would not part with\r\nfor worlds. Any attempt to draw them out of that circle can only inflict\r\na useless annoyance.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MRS. C. VAUGHAN.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Oct. 16, 1898._--I am alone this evening; the wind is\r\nwailing a dirge, and ‘the dark sea drinks in the greyness of the\r\nsky.’[589] But I have been away for three weeks. First to the sisters of\r\nmy old friend Willie Milligan, who now live in the Barrington\r\ndower-house at Shrivenham, close to Beckett, the ideal ‘great house’ of\r\nmy boyhood, so stately and luxurious. Now, so are the mighty fallen, it\r\nis let to some Australians, and the family--unless helped by an\r\nheiress--can never afford to live there again. Then I was with the\r\ndelightful Boynes in the high Shropshire uplands, seeing in the most\r\ncharming way many beautiful old houses. I saw two more from my next\r\nvisit at Oxton in Notts--Wiverton, and Annesley where the Miss Chaworth\r\nMusters, beloved by Byron, once walked on the beautiful old terraces.\r\nAnother echo from my long-ago came from my visit to Streatlam, where I\r\nso often was in my young days, and which is now inhabited by Lord\r\nStrathmore’s sister, Lady Frances Trevanion, and her pleasant cheery\r\nhusband, both most kind cousins to me. The long galleries are filled\r\nwith family portraits, including a great one of Mary Eleanor Bowes,\r\nwhose strange story I have so often told. Lady Frances’s time is greatly\r\ntaken up by the manners and morals of her dogs, the very smallest and\r\nnoisiest I ever saw. They must be the sort of dogs Chaucer speaks of--\r\n\r\n    ‘Of small houndes hadde she, that she fedde\r\n     With rosted flesh and milk, and wastel brede;\r\n     But sore wept she if one of hem were dead.’\r\n\r\n“It was a short journey from Streatlam to Kiplin, the beautiful old\r\nhouse of Admiral Carpenter.... He told me how his grandfather had six\r\nsons, Talbots, and was fond of making them all lie down full length on\r\nthe dining-room floor, joining one another, that he might see how many\r\nyards of sons he had! I saw Richmond from Kiplin: what a beautiful\r\nplace, few abroad equal to it.\r\n\r\n“But my most interesting visit was that to Baddesley Clinton in\r\nWarwickshire, rising, with a fortified central gate-tower, from a deep\r\nstill moat, and with an inner courtyard full of flowers. It has dark\r\ntapestried rooms, several priest’s hiding-holes, ghosts of a lady and a\r\nchild, and a murder-room, stained with the blood of a priest whom a\r\nsquire of Edward IV.’s time slew when he caught him chucking his wife\r\nunder the chin.[590] Then there are all the refined luxuries of fast-day\r\ndinners, evening prayers in the chapel with a congregation of maids\r\nveiled like nuns, and a live Bishop (of Portsmouth), in violet robes and\r\ngold cross and chain, to officiate.\r\n\r\n“Such a bishop he is! such a ripple of wit and wisdom! and so full of\r\nplayfulness! I read and copied somewhere--“A man after God’s own heart\r\nis never a one-sided man. He is not wholly spiritual, he is not wholly\r\nnatural; he is not all earnestness, he is not all play; he cannot be all\r\nthings at once, and therefore he is all things by turns.”[591] Our\r\nBishop at Baddesley was just like this in his fun, in his love of cats,\r\nand never more charming than when he gathered up all the scraps of toast\r\nleft at breakfast, and throwing open one of the windows, called ‘Quack,\r\nquack!’ and crowds of ducks came rushing under the bridge over the moat\r\nto scramble for them, one brown duck, which the Bishop called ‘the\r\norphan,’ being especially cared for. Speaking of the frequent ignorance\r\nof religious intolerance led him to tell of the people of Imola and\r\nBrigatella, who were always quarrelling. When the priest at Brigatella\r\nbegan the paschal mass with ‘Christus immolatus est,’ his congregation\r\nthought it was some compliment to the people of Imola, and declared they\r\nwould kill him unless he began ‘Christus brigatellatus est.’\r\n\r\n“He had been with the Calthorpes of Woodland Vale to see an old house of\r\ntheirs in the Isle of Wight, which was quite deserted, and in the very\r\nroom where it occurred was told the reason why. A friend who had come\r\nthere to stay with Mr. Calthorpe saw there, in the dawn of the morning,\r\nan old woman sitting knitting at the foot of the bed; he even heard the\r\nclick of the knitting-needles. At first he thought she had mistaken the\r\nroom, but it happened again the next day. The third time it happened, he\r\nkicked out. The old woman then turned round her face towards him, and\r\ndisplayed--a death’s-head. Another guest met the old woman on the stairs\r\nand equally saw the death’s-head. No servant would stay in the house,\r\nand now it is pulled down.\r\n\r\n“After the evening service in the chapel, the Bishop went to have a\r\ncigar before going to bed. When I excused myself from joining him, he\r\ntold of Benedict XIV., who offered a pinch of snuff to one of his\r\nCardinals. ‘Santo padre, non ho quel vizio,’ he answered. ‘Se fosse\r\nvizio, tu l’avrei,’ said the Pope.\r\n\r\n“Most charming of all was the châtelaine, the widow of my cousin Heneage\r\nDering, whose first wife was her aunt, Lady Chatterton, the well-known\r\nnovelist. The niece (‘Pysie’ Orpen) was then married to Marmion Ferrers,\r\nthe last of a famous Catholic family lineally descended from the Earl of\r\nDerby attainted in the Wars of the Roses, and himself legally Baron\r\nCompton and De Ferrers, though he never claimed the title on account of\r\nhis poverty and having no son. He was the pleasantest and most genial of\r\nmen--‘the old squire’ he used to be called in Warwickshire. One day he\r\nfound an old woman stealing his wood, and, when she expected a great\r\nscolding, he only said, ‘That load of wood is a great deal too heavy for\r\nyou; you must let me carry it home for you,’ and he did. Another day he\r\ncaught three poachers, and said, ‘Come, now, let us have it out!’ and\r\nthey pulled off their coats and had a regular set-to: he floored two of\r\nthem, he was so strong, and then he let them all go.\r\n\r\n“His life seems to have been made up of deeds of faith and charity, but\r\nhis property fell into decadence and must have been sold, if Heneage\r\nDering, who had married his wife’s aunt, had not come to the rescue.\r\nThey all lived together in the old house, mediaevally, almost mediaeval\r\neven in their dress; and after Lady Chatterton died, and then Marmion\r\nFerrers, a final break-up of the remaining links with the past was\r\nprevented by the marriage of Heneage Dering with the widowed ‘Pysie.’\r\nThey were perfectly happy for several years, but he always said ‘a\r\nsudden death is the happiest death,’ and so in 1892 it was.\r\n\r\n“Over the chapel door is inscribed--\r\n\r\n    ‘Transit gloria mundi,\r\n     Fides catholica manet,’\r\n\r\nand the Catholic religion nourishes as much at Baddesley still as it did\r\nin the time of Sir Edward Ferrers, who founded this branch of the family\r\nin 1517, and left ‘five masses in worship of the five wounds principal\r\nthat Our Lord suffered in His bitter Passion,’ and who is depicted\r\nkneeling before a crucifix, with the legend ‘Amor meus crucifixus est’\r\nissuing from his mouth. On Sunday afternoon we went to hear the\r\nBenediction service beautifully sung by the invisible nuns of a convent\r\nclose by--a convent of ‘Colettines’ from Bruges, a severe form of Poor\r\nClares, founded here in 1850, the first of the Order since the\r\nDissolution. A niece of Lord Clifford was their abbess. There are 250\r\nCatholics at Baddesley.\r\n\r\n“As we drove to Warwick, we passed through a village where the learned\r\nDr. Parr was rector. ‘He took pupils,’ said the Bishop. ‘They were not\r\nvery bright. One of them said, “I make a point of never believing\r\nanything I do not understand.” “Then your creed must be most uncommonly\r\nbrief,” said Dr. Parr.’\r\n\r\n“In returning home, I lingered one day with my kind friend E. Mathews at\r\nSonning. I had often longed to go there on a pilgrimage to dear Hugh\r\nPearson’s grave, and never before been able. What a lovely village it\r\nis, with its old red roofs nestling under tufted trees, and how fragrant\r\nis the beloved memory of the true pastor who gave himself so royally for\r\nhis people. ‘Go and break it to my family,’ were his first words when\r\ntold he could not live, meaning by his family his parishioners, the\r\npeople in the village, who loved him so, and amongst whom he was almost\r\nideally happy, for he was not only always striving to do good for the\r\npoor and helpless, but was successful in doing it.\r\n\r\n    ‘His virtues walked their humble round,\r\n       Nor knew a pause, nor felt a void,\r\n     And sure the Eternal Master found\r\n       His single talent well employ’d.’[592]\r\n\r\n“My volume on ‘Shropshire’ has come out--another book-child launched\r\ninto public life.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ W. H. MILLIGAN, _and_ JOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Belvoir Castle, Nov. 18, 1898._--I have been with my dear Lowthers at\r\nCampsea Ashe, enjoying their large party of pleasant musicianers,\r\nCountess Valda Gleichen, radiant Mrs. Arkwright of the lovely voice,\r\n&c., but enjoying much more two quiet days with the family when the\r\nothers were gone. Mrs. L. took me to Crowe Hall, a moated house with a\r\ndelightful old lady-farmeress, of the hard-working high-thinking type,\r\nso familiar in my boyhood, but almost extinct in these days of\r\nover-dressed, gig-driving, pianoforte-strumming minxes.\r\n\r\n“One of those kind and characteristic telegrams of the Duchess of\r\nRutland, extending over a whole page, has brought me here, where there\r\nis a large party too, almost entirely composed of the Duke’s innumerable\r\nnephews and nieces. As I do not either shoot or care for the regular\r\nevening ball in the gallery, what I like best is the daily walk with the\r\nDuke and Duchess, meeting them in the hall as the clock strikes 12.15,\r\nand wandering in the wood walks or on the nearer terraces, already\r\nfragrant with violets, listening to the Duke’s reminiscences of his own\r\npast and Belvoir’s past, always of endless interest. How I pity my host\r\nand hostess in their over-anxious cares about their immense estates; but\r\nthey must be comforted themselves by the pleasure they are able to give.\r\nSightseers are admitted always, and the great Midland towns daily pour\r\ntheir legions into these beautiful woods: they do no harm and behave\r\nwonderfully well, but one almost feels as if the public, who most enjoy\r\nit, ought to help to keep up the place. In the case of Belvoir, the\r\nscourge of the death-duties affects what is the pleasaunce of thousands.\r\n\r\n“I went with Mrs. G. Drummond to Bottesford, where there is such a grand\r\nseries of monuments of the Earls of Rutland and their families,\r\nincluding one of some children who died by witchcraft. Their nurse was\r\ncondemned to be burnt for it, but said, ‘If I am guilty, may this bit of\r\nbread choke me,’ and it did! The Duchess Elizabeth, who made all the\r\ncharming walks here, moved all the Dukes to her new mausoleum in the\r\nBelvoir woods, but she left the Earls at Bottesford.\r\n\r\n“Hearing of her again here has recalled much that Lady Waterford used to\r\ntell me of the Duchess Isabella, who was called ‘Was a bella’ in her\r\nlater years. She used to describe the painting of her fine portrait by\r\nSir Joshua, how he would rush forward and look closely into her eyes,\r\ntake her well in, and then go as far back as possible and look at the\r\ngeneral effect in a distant glass, chiefly making his picture from that.\r\nLady Adeliza Manners once met a very beautiful peasant girl near\r\nBelvoir, very beautiful except that she had lost one of her best front\r\nteeth. ‘What a misfortune,’ said Lady A.; ‘how could it have\r\nhappened?’--‘Oh, the Duchess (Isabella) had lost one of her front teeth,\r\nso she forced me to have mine taken out to replace it.’\r\n\r\n“I wonder if you went to Harlaxton when you were here--the immense\r\nmodern house by Blomfield, of which a most pleasant Mr. Pearson Gregory\r\nsuddenly found himself the heir from a godfather. He was staying at the\r\ncastle and took me there. When the Empress Frederick was here, she\r\nadmired it beyond words, but I did not: it is magnificent, but too\r\nheavy, and the staircase very dark. Outside there are garden-staircases\r\nand fountains, which are really beautiful, almost worthy of the Villa\r\nAldobrandini. There is a picture of a De Ligne baby, the heir of the\r\nplace, whose cradle was put too close to the fire: a coal flew out, and\r\nit was burnt to death. The village is rendered infinitely picturesque by\r\nstone wells and portals made from fragments of a recently destroyed\r\nmoated manor-house, of which only the gateway is left.\r\n\r\n“There is a great charm in being made a sharer in what Disraeli called\r\n‘the sustained splendour of a stately life,’ but much of the pleasure of\r\na great country-house depends upon whom it falls to your lot to take\r\ndown to dinner, and the Duchess attends to this with careful cleverness.\r\nI was especially amused by one sentence in that delightful ‘Isabel\r\nCarnaby’--‘There is one good thing in getting married. You know then\r\nthat, whatever happens, there is one woman you will never have to take\r\nin to dinner again as long as you live.’\r\n\r\n“And what funny things people say at dinner. Lately--not here--a very\r\n‘great lady’ said to me, ‘I can assure you that the consciousness of\r\nbeing well dressed gives me an inward peace which religion could never\r\nbestow.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE UPPER CORRIDOR, HOLMHURST.]\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Jan. 21, 1899._--I sit alone on my hilltop, amid the\r\nswirling mists, and howling winds, and swelching rain, and am often very\r\ndesolate and full of melancholy thoughts, which require active work to\r\ndrive them away. But I ought not to complain, for before Christmas I was\r\na week with the kind Llangattocks at the Hendre in beautiful\r\nMonmouthshire, seeing much that was interesting, and driving with four\r\nhorses and postillions, to Raglan, and through the beautiful brown\r\nbillowy country of the Forest of Dean. Then I had a quietly happy\r\nfortnight at Torquay with my kind Thornycroft cousins; and went from\r\nthem to Mount Ebford to Pamela Turner, a very pleasant first cousin I\r\nhad not seen for years; paying, lastly, a sad visit--because probably\r\nthe last ever possible--to beautiful Cobham.... Yet I am alone now, and\r\nperhaps it is as well that my thoughts should be always turning to the\r\n‘undiscovered country’ which will be so much to us, and of which we know\r\nnothing, even though we may be very near its shores. I work on, I enjoy\r\non, but I feel more that life is becoming a waiting time.\r\n\r\n    ‘I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;\r\n     My master calls me, I must not say no.’[593]\r\n\r\nAnd there is a sentence of Epictetus which seems to demand thinking\r\nabout. ‘If the Master call, run to the ship, forsaking all these things,\r\nand looking not behind. And if thou be in old age, go not far from the\r\nship at any time, lest the Master should ask, and thou not be ready.’\r\n... It was Adrienne de Lafayette who said, ‘Must we not all die? The\r\ngreat thing is to be always ready; as for the kind of death, that is\r\nonly a detail.’ I think and think, as so many millions have thought, how\r\nit can be after death, and such inquiries and searchings have no answer.\r\nStill, as Jowett wrote towards the close of life, ‘Though we cannot see\r\ninto another life, we believe, with inextinguishable hope, that there is\r\nstill something reserved for us.’\r\n\r\n“I feel the view usually held now on these subjects is wholesomer than\r\nthat of my childhood, when ‘good people’ talked with such dogmatic\r\nassurance, in all ‘le bel air de leur devotion,’ of how glorious their\r\nlife in another world would be, whilst definitely condemning so many of\r\ntheir neighbours to the hell which, in their imagination, was their\r\nGod’s vindictive retaliation for His injuries. I often remember her\r\nwords, and I think I realise the feeling with which my dear old friend\r\nMrs. Duncan Stewart once said to me, ‘I should say, like Dr. Johnson, I\r\nam speaking in crass ignorance, according to the failings of my fallible\r\nhuman nature; and yet, may we not all, whilst acting like fallible human\r\nbeings as we are, trust respectfully to God’s mercy, though speaking of\r\nno glorious future as reserved for us, lest He should say, “What hast\r\nthou done to deserve this?”’\r\n\r\n“Lord Llangattock writes urging me to join the Anti-vivisection Society;\r\nbut I answer I am not competent to judge of it. Then he sends me its\r\npamphlets, which seem to me rather blasphemous, asserting that ‘Christ\r\ndied just as much for all animals as for all human beings.’ What! for\r\nbugs, lice, ringworms, mosquitoes? ‘Don’t kill that flea; Christ died\r\nfor it.’ Then how about cobras and puff-adders? Surely it must have been\r\nthe Devil that died for those. What nonsense people, especially\r\n‘religious people,’ write in these little pamphlets, almost as great\r\nnonsense as most country clergy preach in the dreary Sahara of their\r\nendless sermons. ‘Long texts, short sermons,’ was John Wesley’s maxim,\r\nand what a good one!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL _and_ LETTERS.\r\n\r\n“_Rome, March 10, 1899._--I was very ailing, and Catherine Vaughan\r\ninsisted on my seeing Dr. Sansom, who found me so ‘run down’ that he\r\ninsisted on my coming out here to my ‘native air;’ therefore here I am,\r\nand already it has done me good. I found my dear old friend Miss Garden\r\nrather better than I left her three years ago, and full of her sister\r\nMrs. Ramsay’s escape, having been upset in a carriage close to the edge\r\nof the Tarpeian rock. ‘If the horse had not been _assolutamente\r\npecora_,’ said the coachman, ‘she must have gone over.’\r\n\r\n“The other day I was with a circle of old friends who were discussing\r\nthe ‘Story of my Life.’ ‘Surely the early part must have been\r\nexaggerated,’ said one of them, ‘that story of Aunt Esther hanging the\r\ncat, for instance,[594] because the child loved it.’ ‘I can testify that\r\nthat story was absolutely true, for _I was there_,’ said an old\r\nclergyman present, ‘and I have shuddered over the cruel recollection\r\never since.’ It was Canon Douglas Gordon. I had quite forgotten that he\r\nwas a pupil of Mr. Simpkinson, curate of Hurstmonceaux, at the time. Mr.\r\nGordon also said, ‘I can vouch, too, for the truth of the story of the\r\nbullying at Harrow, for _I was myself the victim_;’ and he told how a\r\nbrutal bully got a dead dog, and cut off its feet, ears, &c., and forced\r\nhim to drink them in coffee. That day he ran away. ‘Alexander Russell’\r\nwent with him. They had only four miles to go to his father Lord\r\nAberdeen’s house at Stanmore. He and Lord Abercorn were governors of the\r\nschool. They happened to be together, and they sent him back in a\r\ncarriage that evening with a letter to the head-master saying that, in\r\nthe interests of the school, what had happened had better be hushed up;\r\nbut that it was so dreadful, that he--the master--must be compelled to\r\ntake the awful bullying in the school seriously in hand. And he did. Mr.\r\nGordon says that the wickedness of Harrow at that time was quite\r\nappalling: things which could never be mentioned were then of nightly\r\noccurrence all over the school. The masters were as bad, and would come\r\ninto the very pupil-rooms humming obscene songs.\r\n\r\n“What an age of independent criticism it is! An acquaintance here said\r\nto me the other day, ‘I have a horror of the patriarchs, and how any one\r\ncan set up such wicked, low, mean men as an example, I cannot\r\nunderstand--Jacob and the rams, for instance. No wonder the Jews were\r\nbad with such examples to follow.... I believe in Christ thoroughly and\r\ncling to the thought of Him: of course the story of His birth and all\r\nthat is very difficult, but “autre pays, autres mœurs,” that is what\r\nI say.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 24._--We have been to Tivoli on the most glorious day--a\r\npellucid sky, and exquisite blue shadows flitting over the young green\r\nof the Campagna. From the station I went to S. Antonio, the old\r\nhermitage and shrine bought by the Searles. Mrs. Searle met me most\r\nkindly. I said, ‘_What_ a beautiful home you have!’ ‘Yes,’ she answered,\r\n‘and the really delightful thing is that _the Lord_ has given it to us.’\r\nI could hardly help saying, ‘I suppose that means you bought it.’\r\nAfterwards I found she was one of the very few ladies who belong to the\r\nSalvation Army. She is kind and Christian beyond words--‘vraie marchande\r\nde bonheur’--and her lovely home is a centre of thoughtful charity; but\r\nbeing in this Catholic country gives her many qualms and shocks. One day\r\nlately she was alone in a lane near her home, and came upon a shrine of\r\nthe Virgin with her little statue, and was filled with righteous\r\nindignation at ‘that doll.’ As she stood there, a number of peasant\r\nwomen came up and knelt before the shrine and prayed most devoutly. When\r\nthey got up she said, ‘How could you pray to that graven image? I wonder\r\nwhat you were praying for.’ ‘Why, we were asking the Madonna to send us\r\nrain; our land needs it so much,’ said the women, much surprised at her\r\nwrath. ‘How can you pray to _her_ for that?’ said Mrs. Searle; ‘let me\r\nshow you how to pray,’ and then and there she knelt down in the dusty\r\nroad and prayed aloud, prayed with her whole heart to her Lord, that He\r\nwould send them the rain they needed; and immediately, though the sky\r\nhad been quite clear till then, it _poured_!\r\n\r\n“The women went away to their priest and told him that they had seen a\r\nlady who reviled the Madonna, but who was a powerful witch and had been\r\nable to bring the rain by her enchantments.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_March 29._--To Sutri with Mrs. Ramsay. In the early morning the dew\r\nwas like crystal, every leaf glistening. The mountains rose pale blue\r\nagainst an opal sky, but were hidden at their base by the delicate mists\r\nof the plain. It was a long, long drive before we reached the great\r\nsolid rock, which is hewn away within into all the circular steps of a\r\nvast amphitheatre overhung by mighty ilexes. Behind it, is an Early\r\nChristian church, also hewn out of the rock,--pillars, font, and altar\r\nall one with it.\r\n\r\n“Se voi pensate sedere sopra una cittadina Americana, voi vi sbagliate,’\r\nwas heard by Gery Cullum from an American lady here in altercation with\r\nher cabman.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_April 1._--I have had one of my Palatine lectures quite in the old\r\nway, and a luncheon with the charming Crown Princess of Sweden has been\r\na great pleasure.\r\n\r\n“Dining at Palazzo Bonaparte, M. de Westenberg told me that one day when\r\nMadame Mère was living there, a stranger came to the palace and insisted\r\nupon seeing her on a matter of vital importance. He was evidently a\r\ngentleman, but would not tell his name or errand. At last his urgency\r\nprevailed, and Madame Mère admitted him. He gave her a crucifix and said\r\nit belonged to her son in St. Helena, and then he said, ‘You need no\r\nlonger be unhappy about him, for he has just entered into rest: his\r\nsorrows are over.’ It was on that day that Napoleon died in St. Helena.\r\n\r\n“Miss Garden says, ‘Lanciani came to me one day. He was not married\r\nthen, and he said, “I am too miserably dull; it cannot go on; I must\r\neither take a wife or a cat.” “Well, and which should you prefer, Signer\r\nLanciani?”--“Oh, a me sono tutte due eguale,” he said. “But la signora\r\nmadre, which would she prefer?”--“Oh, la madre,” he said meditatively,\r\n“il gatto.”\r\n\r\n“‘All life has its sorrows,’ says Miss Garden, ‘only they are unequally\r\ndistributed. Do you know what Eddie Baddeley’s sorrow is? He is only\r\nthree, you know. It is that the turkey-cock at the Villa Borghese will\r\nnot make friends with him. “But don’t you think he will ever like me?”\r\nhe said to his mother. “No, my dear,” she said, “I don’t think he ever\r\nwill.” But it was just one of those cases in which I think a lie would\r\nhave been permissible; she had better have held out hopes.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Palazzo Guadagni, Florence, April 17._--I have been here ten days as\r\nthe guest of the ever-kind Duchess Dowager of Sermoneta, and found Mrs.\r\nand Miss Lowther here.

He spoke of the great\r\ndifficulty of getting any one to do such work as is wanted for St.\r\nPaul’s Cathedral; that few would give up the high prices paid now for\r\nother work for the small prices the Government would pay. He talked of\r\nLeighton, whom he had known intimately in early life. Three tailors in\r\nBond Street, thinking it might be a good speculation, clubbed together\r\nto buy one of his first pictures. They offered £100 for it: he stuck out\r\nfor £200. Eventually it was arranged that they should pay £150, but a\r\nsuit of clothes was to be thrown in. Then came the violent abuse of all\r\nLeighton’s work, and the tailors got alarmed, and sold the picture for\r\n£100 without any suit of clothes. That picture was afterwards bought for\r\nthousands by the Gallery at Liverpool, and there it is now, unlikely\r\never to come to the hammer again.\r\n\r\n“After this, when Leighton’s pictures were accepted for the Academy and\r\nhe was hard at work for the next year, he was told by his studio-man\r\nthat some one wanted to speak to him. He sent out word that he was very\r\nbusy and could not see any one; but the man was pertinacious and would\r\nnot go away. At last Leighton said, ‘Well, he had better come in for a\r\nminute and say what his business is.’ So he was let in. But it was a man\r\nwho stood by the door and did not come further. ‘Well,’ said Leighton,\r\n‘what do you want?’ ‘To come straight to the point at once,’ said the\r\nman, ‘I want that picture’ (pointing to the work upon the easel). ‘You\r\nget £300 now for your pictures, don’t you? Well, I will give you £700.’\r\n‘But you have not even seen the picture,’ said Leighton; ‘you don’t even\r\nknow what the subject is.’ ‘No, I don’t,’ said the man, ‘and, if I did,\r\nI should know no more about it than I do now.’ That man was Agnew. He\r\nacquired the picture: it was his first venture.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Holman Hunt said, speaking of the bad results of Board Schools,\r\nthat he had been away lately. When he came back, a boy came to him as a\r\nmodel, a very good boy, whom he had not seen for some time. ‘Well,’ he\r\nsaid to the boy, ‘it’s a long time since I’ve seen you; I’ve been away;\r\nI’ve been at Stratford-on-Avon.’ ‘Ah,’ said the boy slowly, ‘so you’ve\r\nbeen at Stratford-on-Avon, have you? That’s where Shakspeare lived, him\r\nas married Anne Hathaway, and him as they called the Swan of Avon and\r\nthe smooth-tongued liar (lyre). It’s well I didn’t live in them times,\r\nor they might have been calling me some such beastly names as that.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Sept. 8._--Early on the morning of July 29 I was summoned\r\nfrom home by telegraph to the dying bed of my dear cousin Catherine\r\nVaughan, perhaps more than any one else still left bound up with all my\r\nlife in the long-ago. She had forbidden any one to come to her when ill,\r\nbut desired that, if it was known she was dying, I should be sent for. I\r\nfound her terribly ill and suffering, though delighted to see me. That\r\nSaturday was a day of great anguish, both for herself and those with\r\nher. But she grew calmer in the night, and was with us still for four\r\ndays and nights, during which I seemed to go back into my old life with\r\nmy mother, constantly by her side, fanning her, wiping the poor brow,\r\ntrying to help her to bear through. Almost her very last words were\r\n‘Dear, dear Augustus.’ Then, the day before she quite left us, she was\r\nunconscious, and we sate in a great calm, only waiting for the coming of\r\nthe angel. A majestic beauty had come back to her in the shadow of\r\ndeath, a likeness to her mother, to her brother Arthur Stanley at his\r\nbest, to the ‘Curly Kate’ of sixty years ago, only now they were\r\nsnow-white curls which rippled over the pillow. I think it was the so\r\nfrequent sight of this life-long friend, more intimate and dearer than\r\never in the last few years, yet so much older than myself, which has\r\nalways made me feel young, and that, with her passing away, a bridge is\r\nbroken down. It has been since quite a small added pain to take leave of\r\nthe old furniture and pictures, the inanimate witnesses of our\r\nlives--‘auld nick-nackets’ somebody called them--but still silent and\r\nsacred memorials of the dear Alderley and Norwich family homes, which\r\nhave now passed almost to a stranger. They could still recall to those\r\nfamiliar with them so much that only Kate and I knew, and so much more\r\nthat only Kate and I cared about.\r\n\r\n    ‘Yea, truly, as the sallowing years\r\n     Fall from us faster, like frost-loosened leaves\r\n     Pushed by the misty touch of shortening days,\r\n         And that unwakened winter nears,\r\n     ’Tis the void chair our surest guest receives,\r\n     ’Tis lips long cold that give the warmest kiss,\r\n     ’Tis the lost voice comes oftenest to our ears;\r\n     We count our rosary by the beads we miss.’[595]\r\n\r\n“How long and how full the hours of watching by a death-bed seem! how\r\nfull of what varied emotions and anxieties, an almost agonising\r\neagerness to do the right thing every minute even in a physical sense,\r\nbut much more to _say_ the right thing, only the right thing, to one\r\nwho is on the awful threshold of so great a transition, to whom, because\r\nshe is on the very brink of unravelling the great mystery, all the\r\ncommonplaces, even of religion, must fall so flat. One can only try to\r\nhelp, to _support_ the beloved one, who is passing away from our\r\npossibilities, spiritually as well as physically, try to recollect what\r\nwould be a comfort to oneself in such a crisis, and let oneself go\r\n_with_ the departing one to the very portal itself.\r\n\r\n“With dear Kate I had often spoken of this, yet, when the reality came,\r\nit was unlike all we had imagined, and I suppose it is always so. But I\r\nfelt how well it must always be to talk over the end of life with those\r\nyou are likely to be near when the close really comes. It makes a sort\r\nof death-bed comradeship, if I can so call it, which could never exist\r\nwithout it, and certainly in this case it made Kate cling to my being\r\nconstantly with her, when she would allow no one else to see her. Then\r\nhow seldom _any_ words are possible from a dying person. In the six\r\ndeath-beds I have attended it has been so; and even in this case, when\r\nit lasted four days and nights, there was little speech, only an urgency\r\nthat I should never leave her, that I should keep near her, that I\r\nshould be close by her side as long as she was on earth at all, till she\r\npassed into the unseen.\r\n\r\n“Whilst feeling the change which her loss makes in my life, I have read\r\nwords of Bishop Magee which have come home to me. ‘The most beautiful\r\nand natural of sunsets is still a sunset, and the shadows that follow it\r\nare chill and depressing. I begin to feel the peculiar sadness that the\r\ndeath of much older relatives brings to those who are entering\r\nthemselves on old age. When I see all those whom I remember once,\r\nmiddle-aged men and women, younger by many years than I am now, all\r\npassed and gone, I feel somehow as if light was going out of life very\r\nfast. There are so few living with whom one can recall the _past_, and\r\ngrow young again in recalling it.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Sept. 31._--I have been a week at Swaylands to meet the\r\nDuchess of York, and as there were scarcely any other guests, saw a\r\ngreat deal of her, and was increasingly filled with admiration for the\r\ndignified simplicity and single-mindedness, and the high sense of duty\r\nby which her naturally merry, genial nature is pervaded, and which will\r\nbe the very salvation of England some day. Before her scandal sits dumb:\r\nshe has a quiet but inflexible power of silencing everything which seems\r\nlikely to approach ill-natured gossip, yet immediately after gives such\r\na genial kindly look and word to the silenced one as prevents any\r\nfeeling of mortification. All morning the Duchess was occupied with her\r\nlady in real hard work, chiefly letters, I believe; in the afternoons we\r\nwent for long drives and sight-seeings--of Penshurst, Knole,\r\nGroombridge, Hever, Ightham, and she was full of interest in the history\r\nand associations of these old-world places. At Hever the owners were\r\naway, but we got a table from a cottage, and an excellent tea-meal was\r\nspread upon it at the top of the high field above the castle. If the\r\nDuchess is ever Queen of England, that table will be considered to have\r\na history.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Sept. 8._--I have been in Suffolk on an ancestor-hunt,\r\nwhich involved a delightful visit to Herbert and Lady Mary Ewart at\r\nGreat Thurlow. It was in the time of George I., I think, that our\r\ngreat-great-uncle Francis Naylor, the owner of Hurstmonceaux Castle, a\r\n‘Medmenham Brother’ and the wildest of the wild, was led to a changed\r\nand better life by his love for the beautiful Carlotta Alston of\r\nEdwardstone. Unfortunately, whilst they were engaged, his father, Bishop\r\nHare, found out that her elder sister, Mary Margaret, was one of the\r\ngreatest heiresses in England, married her without telling his son till\r\nthe day before the wedding, and then positively forbade him to become\r\nhis brother-in-law. Francis Naylor was very much inclined to go to the\r\ndevil again, but Carlotta maintained her influence, and eventually they\r\nwere married without the Bishop’s consent. They were too poor to live at\r\nHurstmonceaux, but the third Miss Alston had married the rich Stephen\r\nSoame, and she gave them a home, and there, in the house of the generous\r\nAnne Soame, they lived and died. The old Jacobean mansion of Little\r\nThurlow was magnificent and had eighty-one bedrooms; its beautiful\r\nwrought-iron gates with pilasters were given by Charles II., who often\r\nstayed there, and the family lived at Little Thurlow in most unusual\r\nstate, even for that time, driving out daily in three\r\ncarriages-and-four. Sir Stephen Soame, the builder of the house, has a\r\ngrand tomb in the church where Francis and Carlotta Naylor and Anne\r\nSoame are buried behind his stately carved pew, and there are a most\r\npicturesque grammar-school and almshouses erected by him. I remember\r\nsome of the Soames coming to Hurstmonceaux--as cousins--in my childhood,\r\nbut their direct line died out at last, and the place went to some very\r\ndistant relations from Beverley, who pulled down the old hall, because\r\n‘they could not live in a house where you could drive a coach-and-four\r\nup the great staircase.’ Old Mrs. Soame, however, of the second set, did\r\nnot die till she was 104, and the last of her two daughters only in\r\n1885. Yet the Misses Soame had never been to London: their travels were\r\nlimited to being driven twice a year to Lowestoft in their large yellow\r\nchariot with post-horses. They always intended to try the railway by\r\ngoing from Haverhill to the next station and having their carriage to\r\nmeet them there; but when the day came they shrank from the feat. They\r\nwere ‘worth an income to the doctor, the chemist, and the fishmonger,’\r\nand they left a fortune to the family of a man who had once proposed to\r\none of them.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, Oct. 23._--Again I have been on an ancestor-hunt. I met\r\nMrs. Lowther at the old haunted house of Lawford Hall near Manningtree,\r\nand our hostess, Mrs. Mouncey, sent us to Hadleigh, where Mary Margaret\r\nAlston’s grandfather, Charles Trumbull, was the very saintly Rector in\r\nthe time of James II., and resigned his living for his ordination oath’s\r\nsake on the advent of William III. The Rectory, now known as the\r\nDeanery, is a glorious old house, with a grand brick gateway, priests’\r\nhiding-holes, and curious pictures by Canaletto--an intimate friend and\r\nvisitor of one of the rectors--let into its walls. It was the home of\r\nRowland Taylor, the Marian martyr, who was dragged down the street of\r\nHadleigh to his stake outside the town ‘cracking jokes all the way,’ and\r\nanother vicar was Hugh Rose, when Archbishop Trench was the curate.\r\n\r\n“Two days later I went to Edwardstone, a delightful old place near\r\nSudbury, one of the many of which Bishop Hare’s wife was the heiress,\r\nand where numbers of her Alston ancestors are buried; and then I was two\r\ndays at the familiar Campsea Ashe, where, as its beloved owner says, ‘If\r\nyou do not know how to enjoy yourself, you must be made to.’ Mr. Astor\r\nwas there, and told me that the origin of the American expression ‘a\r\nchestnut’ lay in the rivalries of the theatres in Chestnut Street and\r\nWalnut Street in New York. An expected star who came out in the Walnut\r\nStreet Theatre could only do things which had already appeared in\r\nChestnut Street, and when the young men saw them they said, ‘That’s a\r\nchestnut,’ and it passed into a proverb.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Astor was very funny about a man who was always late for\r\neverything, and who one day, when he was expecting a party to stay with\r\nhim, rushed home after all his guests had arrived. On the stairs he met\r\na man, with whom, to make up for lost time, he shook hands most warmly,\r\nsaying, ‘Oh, my dear fellow, I’m so glad to see you; do make yourself\r\nquite at home and enjoy yourself.’ It was a burglar, very much surprised\r\nat his cordial reception, for he was carrying off all the valuables. He\r\nalso said--\r\n\r\n“‘You know Dr. N. and his wonderful tales. I heard him tell of going to\r\nshoot chamois. He had sighted one a long way off and fired. He said the\r\nchamois never moved, but put up one foot and scratched its ear. He fired\r\nagain, and it put up the other foot and scratched the other ear. Then he\r\nfired again and killed it. When he came up to it, he found that each of\r\nthe first shots had touched an ear. The chamois had only thought, “Oh,\r\nthese damned fleas!”\r\n\r\n“‘Then Dr. N. told of how he went after bears. A grisly came and he shot\r\nhim: then another grisly came and he shot him: then a third grisly\r\ncame.... “If you say you shot _him_” said a man present, “I’ll throw\r\nthis bottle at your head.” “Well, the third grisly escaped,” calmly said\r\nDr. N.’\r\n\r\n“The last two days of my absence I spent with the Grant Duffs at Lexden\r\nManor, where Sir Mountstuart was most agreeable and anecdotive, and\r\nwhence Lady Grant Duff drove me to see the old gateway of Layer Marney,\r\nbeautiful in its great decay.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_London, Nov. 29._--Luncheon with the C.’s, who had dined last night\r\nwith the Wilberforces. Canon Wilberforce told them of a missionary\r\nestablishment in Africa, a most admirable mission, which had been most\r\neffective, had converted the whole neighbourhood, built church and\r\nschools, and done no end of good.\r\n\r\n“Then, in some crisis or other, the mission was swept away and the place\r\nwas long left desolate.\r\n\r\n“After many years the missionaries returned, expecting to find\r\neverything destroyed. But, to their astonishment, they found the\r\nchurch-bell going and the buildings in perfect repair, all looking as\r\nbefore--only there _was_ a difference. They could not make out what it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n“So they went to the chief and asked him about it. ‘Well, yes,’ he said,\r\n‘there _is_ one little difference. You used to tell us that God was love\r\nand always watching over us for good, while the devil was always seeking\r\nto destroy us; so we felt it was the devil we had better propitiate, and\r\nit is the devil we have worshipped ever since you left, and--it has most\r\ncompletely answered.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Dec. 22, 1899._--I am just at the end of a long retreat in a sort of\r\nprivate hospital, where I have been for the sake of the ‘Nauheim cure’\r\nfor an affection of the heart, from which I have now suffered for more\r\nthan a year, and which was greatly increased by the anxieties and\r\nsorrows of last August. I am better since my ‘cure,’ but am seldom quite\r\nwell now, and, as I read in a novel, ‘my dinner is always either a\r\nsatisfying fact or a poignant memory,’ and generally the latter. The\r\nSouth African war news is casting a shadow over the closing year, and\r\nthe death of Lady Salisbury has been a real sorrow--an ever-kind friend\r\nsince my early boyhood. I went to the memorial service for her in the\r\nChapel-Royal--a beautiful service, but a very sad one to many.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_To_ MRS. _and_ MISS AGNES THORNYCROFT (_after a happy visit to\r\nthem at Torquay_).\r\n\r\n“_Liskeard, May 7, 1900._--I will begin a history to my two kindest of\r\nhostesses from this dreary wind-stricken little town, which is as ugly\r\nas it can be, but with a large, clean, old-fashioned posting-inn. I got\r\na little victoria to take me the 2½ miles to St. Cleer’s Well in the\r\nuplands, in a moorland village, approached by primrosy, stitchworty\r\nlanes. The well is a glorious subject for sketching, old grey stones\r\ntinged with golden lichen, a canopy of open Norman arches, and\r\nbackground of purple hill. It was so bitterly, snowily cold that I\r\nfeared, as I sate down on my camp-stool, that sciatica would never allow\r\nme to rise from it; but Providence sent me a whole schoolful of\r\nchildren, boys and girls, about sixty of them, who pressed close round\r\nthrough the whole performance, so I just wore them like an eider-down,\r\nand was rather hot than otherwise. Returning, the evening was still so\r\nyoung that I took the carriage on to St Keyne’s Well, on the other side\r\nof Liskeard, but it was scarcely worth the visit.”\r\n\r\n“_Helston, May 8_, 6 P.M.--No farther than this, for when I arrived here\r\nat midday, I found there was no chance of getting on to the Lizard; the\r\nwhole town was in too great a turmoil to attend to any individual, for\r\nit was Furry Day, a local floral festa from very early times, and all\r\nthe gentlemen and ladies of the neighbourhood (the real ones!) were\r\ndancing in couples, with bands playing through the streets, under\r\ngarlanded arches and flags flying from every window. This sounds\r\nlovely, but really was not--only curious, though it gave infinite\r\nsatisfaction to the thousands of spectators, who on this day bring great\r\nwealth to the town. But oh! the noise and discomfort for an unwilling\r\nspectator--the organs, and peep-shows, and wild-beast shows, and ‘Boer\r\nand Briton’ shows, and horsemanship-ladies careering through the streets\r\nafter the dancing was over. If any one wishes to know what the Inferno\r\nis like and the worst din the human mind can imagine, they should spend\r\na ‘Furry Day;’ only, to be sure, at Helston all the people are quite\r\ngood, which would probably make a very considerable difference!”\r\n\r\n“_Helston, May 10._--Yesterday I breakfasted in the coffee-room with an\r\nold gentleman who was exceedingly angry with me because I did not think\r\nSterne’s ‘Sentimental Journey’ should be one of the twelve novels to be\r\nsaved if all the rest in the world were swept away--‘only the most dense\r\nignorance of literature’ could make me confess such a thing!\r\n\r\n“It was a drive of ten miles in a grand and lonely landau through a\r\ncountry brilliant with gorse and blackthorn. Beneath a great plantation\r\non the right was the Loe Pool, only separated by a strip of silver sand\r\nfrom the sea, and described in Tennyson’s ‘Morte d’Arthur.’ Beyond a\r\nwooded hollow with rocks and fir trees the road enters upon the\r\nhigh-lying plain of the Lizard, wind-stricken, storm-swept, without a\r\ntree, the houses of ugly Lizard-town rising black against a pellucid sky\r\non the horizon. A scrambling walk down a rugged lane, and then a pathlet\r\nmarked by white stones above tremendous precipices brought me to\r\nKynance Cove--a little disappointing, for it was high water when it\r\nought to have been low, and a grey colourless day when it ought to have\r\nbeen brilliant. However, my drawing ‘answered,’ as Aunt Kitty would have\r\nsaid, and in two hours, as it began to mizzle, I was ready to return.”\r\n\r\n“_Tintagel, May 10._--The ‘girling’ of the sea in the old ballad of ‘Sir\r\nPatrick Spens’ just expresses what one hears here. This ‘Wharncliffe\r\nArms’ is an ideal inn, and very striking is the little glen, now so\r\nprimrosy, with the black ruined castle, the cries of the seabirds--\r\n\r\n    ‘And the great sea-waves below,\r\n     Pulse of the midnight, beating slow.’”[596]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Royal Hotel, Bideford, May 15._--This house has beautiful old rooms\r\nbuilt by John Davy, the first tobacco merchant, with splendid Italian\r\nceilings: the little _Revenge_ was built in a shipping yard just before\r\nthe house, and in a narrow street on the other side the river is a\r\npublic-house which is the house of Sir Richard Grenville. I thought the\r\npath above the precipice at Lynton the most beautiful sea-walk I ever\r\nsaw. In places it is a sheer wall of rock rising from the waves--\r\n\r\n    ‘Which roar, rock-thwarted, under bellowing caves\r\n     Beneath the windy wall.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Middlewick, Corsham, May 18._--The kind Clutterbucks, with whom I am\r\nstaying, took me to Castlecombe yesterday, the home of the Scroopes for\r\nfive hundred years, and quite one of the most enchanting places in\r\nEngland, in its green glen, its clear rushing river, its exquisite\r\nchurch tower and old market-cross. I saw it last at nine years old, and\r\nwas enchanted to find its loveliness all and more than I remembered.\r\nTo-day we went to luncheon at Harnish, and I visited once more the\r\nlittle rectory where I was at school for three and a half most miserable\r\nyears. How different a little boy’s path is now! We saw Corsham Court\r\nafterwards, with Cronje’s flag floating over its staircase.”\r\n\r\n“_Holmhurst, May 23._--I found a very large party on Saturday at\r\nhospitable Mr. Astor’s, and Cliveden in great beauty, entrancing carpets\r\nof bluebells under the trees. A telegram from the Queen of Sweden took\r\nme to Roehampton on Monday. It was twenty-two years since I had seen the\r\nKing, and I thought him even handsomer and more royal-looking than of\r\nold. The Queen is not less fragile, and as full of good thoughts and\r\nwords as ever. I had luncheon with the royal pair and their household,\r\nand a long talk with the Queen afterwards, who told me much of my\r\nespecial Prince, now Regent in his father’s absence.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\nFAREWELL\r\n\r\n              “Pleasure to our hot grasp\r\n              Gives flowers after flowers;\r\n              With passionate warmth we grasp\r\n              Hand after hand in ours:\r\n    Now do we soon perceive how fast our youth is spent.”\r\n                        --MATTHEW ARNOLD.\r\n\r\n    “Oh, He has taught us what reply to make,\r\n     Or secretly in spirit, or in words,\r\n     If there be need, when sorrowing men complain\r\n     The fair illusions of their youth depart,\r\n     All things are going from them, and to-day\r\n     Is emptier of delights than yesterday,\r\n     Even as to-morrow will be barer yet:\r\n     We have been taught to feel this need not be,\r\n     This is not life’s inevitable law;\r\n     But that the gladness we are called to know\r\n     Is an increasing gladness, that the soil\r\n     Of the human heart, tilled rightly, will become\r\n     Richer and deeper, fitted to bear fruit\r\n     Of an immortal growth from day to day,\r\n     Fruit of love, life, and inefficient joy.”--R. C TRENCH.\r\n\r\n     “Lord, I owe thee a death: let it not be terrible: yet Thy will,\r\n     not mine, be done.”--HOOKER.\r\n\r\n    “When the tapers now burn blue,\r\n     And the comforters are few,\r\n     And that number more than true,\r\n         Sweet Spirit, comfort me!”--HERRICK.\r\n\r\n\r\nI must close this book. Printers are calling for its last pages. It is\r\nlike seeing an old friend go forth into a new world, and wondering if\r\nthose who inhabit it will understand him and treat him well. Perhaps no\r\none will read it except the intimate circle--a large one certainly--who\r\nhave loved Hurstmonceaux, Stoke, and little Holmhurst at different\r\ntimes. But I can never regret having written it, and it has been so\r\ngreat an enjoyment to me, that perhaps others may like it; for I have\r\nconcealed nothing, and Coleridge says, “I could inform the dullest\r\nauthor how he might write an interesting book. Let him relate the events\r\nof his own life with honesty, not disguising the feelings that\r\naccompanied them.”[597]\r\n\r\nMost people will say two volumes would have been enough, but the fact is\r\nI have written chiefly for myself and my relations, and not for the\r\ngeneral public at all. They may read the book if they like, but it was\r\nnot intended for them, and, as Walter Scott describes it--\r\n\r\n    “Most men, when drawn to speak about themselves,\r\n     Are moved by little and by little to say more\r\n     Than they first dreamt; until at last they blush,\r\n     And can but hope to find secret excuse\r\n     In the self-knowledge of their auditors.”[598]\r\n\r\nExcept that I have seen more varieties of people than some do, I believe\r\nthere has been nothing unusual in my life. All lives are made up of joys\r\nand sorrows with a little calm, neutral ground connecting them; though,\r\nfrom physical reasons perhaps, I think I have enjoyed the pleasures and\r\nsuffered in the troubles more than most. But from the calm backwater of\r\nmy present life at Holmhurst, as I overlook the past, the pleasures seem\r\nto predominate, and I could cordially answer to any one who asked me “Is\r\nlife worth living?”--“Yes, to the very dregs.”\r\n\r\nSainte-Beuve says, “Il est donné, de nos jours, à un bien petit nombre,\r\nmême parmi les plus délicats et ceux qui les apprécient le mieux, de\r\nrecueillir, d’ordonner sa vie selon ses admirations et selon ses goûts,\r\navec suite, avec noblesse.” And latterly my days have been “avec suite;”\r\n“avec noblesse” is what they ought to have been. In my quiet home, of\r\nwhich little has been said in these volumes, days succeed each other\r\nunmarked, but on the whole happy, though sometimes very lonely. The\r\nwhole time passes very quickly, yet it is, as I remember the Grand\r\nDuchess Stephanie of Baden wrote to my aunt Mrs. Stanley--“In youth the\r\nyears are long, the moments short, but in age the moments are long, the\r\nyears short.” Really I have been alone here for thirty years, twelve in\r\nwhich my dearest Lea was still presiding over the lower regions of the\r\nhouse, and eighteen in absolute solitude. It is the winter evenings,\r\nafter the early twilight has set in, which are the longest. Then there\r\nare often no voices but those of the past:--\r\n\r\n    “Time brought me many another friend\r\n       That loved me longer;\r\n     New love was kind, but in the end\r\n       Old love was stronger.\r\n\r\n     Years come and go, no New Year yet\r\n       Hath slain December,\r\n     And all that should have cried, Forget!\r\n       Cried but--Remember!”\r\n\r\nPeople say, “It is all your own fault that you are solitary; you ought\r\nto have married long ago.” But they know nothing about it; for as long\r\nas my mother lived, and for some time after, I had nothing whatever to\r\nmarry upon, and after that I had very little, and I have been constantly\r\nreminded that people of the class in which I have always lived do not\r\nlike to marry paupers. Besides, the fact is, that except in one\r\nimpossible case perhaps, very long ago, “I have never loved any one\r\nwell enough to put myself in a noose for them: it is a noose, you\r\nknow.”[599] What I have to regret is that I have no very near relations\r\nwho have in the least my own interests and sympathies, though they are\r\nall very kind to me. I have far more in common with many of my younger\r\nfriends, “the boys,” who cease to be boys after a few years, and many of\r\nwhom, I am sure, turn to Holmhurst as the haven of their lives. But one\r\nfeels that there would be this difference between any very congenial\r\nnear relations and even the kindest friends: the latter are very glad to\r\nsee one, but would be very sorry to see more of one; whilst the former,\r\nif they existed, would take it as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nBy friends I often feel that I am greatly over-estimated, so many ask my\r\nadvice, and act upon what I tell them. It is a responsibility, but I\r\nfeel that I am right in urging what I have always found answer in my own\r\ncase, and what has greatly added to my happiness. When a wrong,\r\nsometimes a very cruel wrong, is done to one, one must not try at once\r\nto do some good to those who have done it, because that would be to\r\nmortify them; but if one immediately, at once, sets to think of what\r\none can do for somebody else, it takes out the taste. Then one can very\r\nsoon paste down that unpleasant page of life, as if it had never\r\nexisted, and all will be as before.\r\n\r\nAlso, always believe the best of people till the worst is proved, and\r\nmeditate not on your miseries, but your blessings.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of all the blessings I have to be grateful for is, that\r\nthough, since my serious illness six years ago, I have never been\r\nentirely without pain, I have, notwithstanding this, good health and a\r\nfeeling of youth--just the same feeling I had forty years ago. I suppose\r\nthere will be many who will be surprised to see in these pages how old I\r\nam; I am unspeakably surprised at it myself. I have to be perpetually\r\nreminding myself of my years, that I am so much nearer the close than\r\nthe outset of life. I feel so young still, that I can hardly help making\r\nplans for quite the far-distant future, schemes of work and of travel,\r\nand I hope sometimes of usefulness, which of course can never be\r\nrealised. I have very good spirits, and I feel that I should be\r\ninexcusable if I were not happy when I remember the contrast of my\r\npresent life to my oppressed boyhood, or to the terrible trial of the\r\ntime when every thought was occupied by such tangled perplexities as\r\nthose of the Roman Catholic conspiracy.\r\n\r\nMy next greatest blessing is my home, so infinitely, so exquisitely\r\nsuited to my needs, and indeed to all my wishes. As I write this, and\r\nlook from my window across the tiny terrace with its brilliant flowers\r\nto the oakwoods, golden in the autumn sunset, and the blue sea beyond,\r\nwith the craggy mass of Hastings Castle rising up against it, I feel\r\nthat there are few places more lovely than Holmhurst. Then the walks in\r\nthe grounds offer a constant variety of wood and rock, flowers and\r\nwater, and the distant view changes constantly, and composes into a\r\nhundred pictures. And in the little circle of this pleasant home love\r\nassuredly reigns supreme. I look upon my servants as my best and truest\r\nfriends; their rooms, in their way, are as pretty and comfortable as my\r\nown, and I believe that they have a real pleasure in serving me. We\r\nunite together in looking after our less fortunate friends, who come in\r\nbatches, for a month each set, to the little Hospice in the grounds. I\r\ncould not ask my servants to do this, but they are delighted to help me\r\nthus, as in everything. When one of our little household community, as\r\nhas happened four times now, passes, in an honoured and cherished old\r\nage, from amongst us, we all mourn together, watch by the deathbed, and\r\nfollow the flower-laden coffin to the grave.\r\n\r\nMy local affections are centred in Holmhurst now. Rome, which I was\r\nformerly even fonder of, is so utterly changed, it has lost its\r\nenchaining power, and, with the places, the familiar faces there have\r\nall passed away. I go there every third year, but not for pleasure, only\r\nbecause it is necessary for “Walks in Rome,” the one of my books which\r\npays best.\r\n\r\nIn the summer I generally have guests at Holmhurst, but even then my\r\nmornings are passed in writing, and several twilight hours besides. In\r\nthe evenings there is generally reading aloud, or there are drawings to\r\nbe looked at, or if “the boys” are with me there are games. Then the\r\nearly months of spring are often spent abroad, and the later in London,\r\nand in the autumn I have the opportunity of far more visits than I like\r\nto pay: so that I have quite sufficient people-seeing to prevent getting\r\nrusty, or at any rate to remind me of my utter insignificance in every\r\nsociety except my own. However, Reviews are a perfect antidote to all\r\nfollies of vainglory. I used to be pained by the most abusive ones,\r\nthough I generally learnt something from them. Latterly, however, I have\r\nbeen more aware of the indescribable incapacity and indolence of the\r\nwriters, and have not cared at all. I a little wonder, however, why I\r\nhave scarcely ever had a favourable Review. My work cannot always have\r\nbeen so _terribly_ bad, or it would not have had so wide a\r\ncirculation--wider, I think, than has attended any other work of the\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nHow I wish one knew something, anything, of the hereafter to which the\r\nOld Testament never alludes, and of which the New Testament tells us\r\nnothing satisfactory. Can we really sleep, for millions of years\r\nperhaps, or can we live in another hemisphere, or can we linger here\r\nnear people and places we love, incorporeal, invisible? I believe all\r\nthe truths of revealed religion, but there is so much that is\r\nunrevealed. Oh! if the disciples, during their three years’ opportunity,\r\nhad only asked our Saviour a few more questions--questions so absolutely\r\nessential, to which the answers would have been of such _vital_\r\nimportance. For oh! how far more important what our state after death is\r\nthan all our life’s work, than everything we have done or said or\r\nwritten, or what any one has thought of us. I can truly say with Olga de\r\nla Ferronays, “Je crois, j’aime, j’espère, je me repens;” but how\r\nstrangely dim is the clearest sight as to the future. “The awful\r\nmysteries of life and nature,” says Whittier, “sometimes almost\r\noverwhelm me. What? Where? Whither? These questions sometimes hold me\r\nbreathless. How little, after all, do we know! And the soul’s anchor of\r\nFaith can only grapple fast upon two or three things, and fast and\r\nsurest of all upon the Fatherhood of God.”[600]\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing how little good can be derived from all the religious\r\nteaching which is the form and order of the day, from the endless\r\nmonotony of services, from the wearisome sermons, not one of which\r\nremains with me from the thousands upon thousands I have been condemned\r\nto listen to, some few of them excellent, but most of them a farrago of\r\nstilted nonsense. I suppose that there are some types of mind which are\r\nbenefited by them: I cannot believe that they were good for me. “Oh,\r\nstop, do stop; you have talked enough,” my whole heart has generally\r\ncried out when I have listened to a preacher--generally a man whom one\r\nwould never dream of listening to in ordinary conversation for a quarter\r\nof an hour. It is a terrible penalty to pay for one’s religion to have\r\nweekly to hear it worried and tangled by these incapable and often\r\narrogant beings. What does really remain with me, and raise my mind\r\nheavenwards with every thought of it, is the gentle teaching of my sweet\r\nmother in my childhood, and the practical lesson of her long life of\r\nlove to God and man; the austere, unswerving uprightness and justice\r\nwhich was the mainspring of life’s action to the dear old nurse who was\r\nspared for forty-eight years to be the blessing of our home, ever one of\r\nthose who, as Emerson says, “make the earth wholesome;” the remembrance\r\nof Hugh Pearson, Lady Waterford, and many other holy ones entered into\r\nthe Perfect Life, and the certainty whence their peace in life and their\r\ncalm in death was derived. Whittier again echoes my own thoughts when he\r\nsays, “I regard Christianity as a life rather than a creed; and in\r\njudging my fellow-men, I can use no other standard than that which our\r\nLord and Master has given us, ‘By their fruits ye shall know them.’ The\r\nonly orthodoxy that I am especially interested in is that of life and\r\npractice.”\r\n\r\nI know my own great imperfection and unworthiness, and when I turn from\r\nmyself to others, I cannot judge them. One cannot know all the secret\r\nguiding wires of action in them. I think perhaps the secret of any\r\ninfluence I have with boys is, that though I am willing to tell them\r\nwhat I think best as to the future, I never condemn their past; I am not\r\ncalled upon to do so. Southey’s lines come back to me:--\r\n\r\n                            “Oh, what are we,\r\n    Frail creatures that we are, that we should sit\r\n    In judgment man on man! And what were we\r\n    If the All-Merciful should mete to us\r\n    With the same rigorous measure wherewithal\r\n    Sinner to sinner metes!”[601]\r\n\r\nWhen I look at the dates of births and deaths in our family in the\r\nFamily Bible, I see that I have already exceeded the age which has been\r\nusually allotted to the Hares. Can it be that, while I still feel so\r\nyoung, the evening of life is closing in. Perhaps it may not be so,\r\nperhaps long years may still be before me. I hope so; but the lesson\r\nshould be the same, for “man can do no better than live in eternity’s\r\nsunrise.”[602]\r\n\r\n“La figure de ce monde passe. Sans la possession de l’éternité, sans la\r\nvue religieuse de la vie, ces journées fugitives ne sont qu’un sujet\r\nd’effroi, le bonheur doit être une prière et le malheur aussi.

Greenleaf Whittier, “Letters.”\r\n\r\n[2] I had to pay a duty of 10 per cent, even on all my own money and\r\nsavings, as it had been unfortunately invested in her name.\r\n\r\n[3] Archibald, eldest son of John Archibald Colquhoun of Killermont,\r\nN.B., and Chartwell, near Westerham, in Kent.\r\n\r\n[4] Archie Colquhoun died at Nice in the following spring.\r\n\r\n[5] From “The Story of Two Noble Lives.”\r\n\r\n[6] These rooms have been entirely altered since Lady Waterford’s death.\r\n\r\n[7] Mary Amelia, widow of the first Marquis.\r\n\r\n[8] Daughter of the 5th Earl of Balcarres.\r\n\r\n[9] James Edward, 2nd Earl.\r\n\r\n[10] Afterwards Dean of Wells.\r\n\r\n[11] The picture was exhibited in the spring of 1845, and was sent\r\nstraight to Hurstmonceaux from the Exhibition.\r\n\r\n[12] Our cousins Sir Alexander and Lady Taylor. See vol. iii.\r\n\r\n[13] The Rev. Henry Liddell, brother of my great-uncle Ravensworth, and\r\nwhose wife, Charlotte Lyon, was niece of my great-grandmother, Lady Anne\r\nSimpson.\r\n\r\n[14] Don Juan died in 1880, leaving his last great work, the restoration\r\nof Leon Cathedral, unfinished.\r\n\r\n[15] This was my first meeting with Everard Primrose, afterwards for\r\nmany years one of my most intimate friends. He had a cold manner, which\r\nwas repellant to those who did not know him well, and in conversation he\r\nwas tantalising, for nothing came out of him at all comparable to what\r\none knew was within. But no young man’s life was more noble, stainless,\r\nand full of highest hopes and purposes. He died--to my lasting\r\nsorrow--of fever during the African campaign of 1885. His mother printed\r\na memoir afterwards, which was a beautiful and simple portrait of his\r\nlife--a very model of biographical truth.\r\n\r\n[16] It has since been entirely destroyed.\r\n\r\n[17] From “Paris.”\r\n\r\n[18] W. S. Landor.\r\n\r\n[19] Dr. Chalmers.\r\n\r\n[20] Wordsworth.\r\n\r\n[21] For these old friends of my mother, _vide_ vols. i. and iii.\r\n\r\n[22] This dear old lady (widow of a first cousin of my father’s) lived\r\nin uncomplaining poverty till 1891, and was a great pleasure to me. I\r\nwas glad to be able to contribute to the support of her small\r\nestablishment at Norbiton.\r\n\r\n[23] Since this was written the pictures have all been dispersed.\r\n\r\n[24] From “The Story of Two Noble Lives.”\r\n\r\n[25] Mrs. T. Erskine’s novel.\r\n\r\n[26] George Macdonald.\r\n\r\n[27] Lady Margaret Beaumont, whom I afterwards knew very intimately, and\r\nlearnt to regard with ever-increasing esteem and affection, died, to my\r\ngreat sorrow, March 31, 1888.\r\n\r\n[28] Afterwards Lieutenant-General Henry Hope Crealock. He died May\r\n1891.\r\n\r\n[29] The Mote has since been sold and its contents dispersed.\r\n\r\n[30] Mr. Hailstone of Walton Hall died 1890, his wife some years\r\nearlier. He bequeathed his topographical collections to the Chapter at\r\nYork, where they are preserved as the “Hailstone Yorkshire Library.”\r\n\r\n[31] This church, the most interesting memorial of the Brontë life at\r\nHaworth, was wantonly destroyed in 1880-81.\r\n\r\n[32] Lady Salisbury’s description.\r\n\r\n[33] Told me by Lord Houghton.\r\n\r\n[34] _Note added 1890._--Authorities now decide that this picture does\r\nnot represent Mary at all, and it is certainly not, as formerly stated,\r\nby Zucchero, for Zucchero, who was never in England till the Queen was\r\nin captivity, never painted her.\r\n\r\n[35] Afterwards Lady Sherbrooke.\r\n\r\n[36] This was so for a long time. Then in about ten years several more\r\neditions were called for in rapid succession. One can never anticipate\r\nhow it will be with books.\r\n\r\n[37] 1890.--This was so for many years: then the sale of “Days near\r\nRome” suddenly and unaccountably stopped.\r\n\r\n[38] From “Days near Rome”\r\n\r\n[39] Miss Margaret Foley died Dec. 1877.\r\n\r\n[40] Afterwards Lady Compton.\r\n\r\n[41] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[42] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[43] Perhaps the interest of these details is of the past, but I insert\r\nthem because the conduct of the Sardinian Government is being rapidly\r\nforgotten, and I was at great pains in obtaining accurate statistics and\r\nverifying the facts mentioned.\r\n\r\n[44] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[45] Afterwards Duchess of Marino.\r\n\r\n[46] Mother of the Duchess S. Arpino.\r\n\r\n[47] Shortly before this my publishers had given me a magnificently\r\nbound copy of “Walks in Rome,” with the desire that I would present it\r\nto Princess Margherita. I demurred to doing this, because, owing to the\r\nstrictures which the book contains on the “Sardinian Government,” I\r\nthought it might be considered little less than an impertinence; but I\r\ntold the Duchess S. Arpino, who was in waiting at the time, and she\r\nrepeated it. The amiable Princess said, “I am sorry Mr. Hare does not\r\nappreciate us, but I should like my present all the same,” and the book\r\nwas sent to her.\r\n\r\n[48] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[49] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[50] This quaint journey is described in the introductory chapter of\r\n“Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[51] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[52] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[53] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[54] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[55] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[56] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[57] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[58] Miss Kate Malcolm, the last of her family, died, universally\r\nbeloved, in May 1891.\r\n\r\n[59] From “Northern Italy.”\r\n\r\n[60] From “Northern Italy.”\r\n\r\n[61] Samuel Wilberforce.\r\n\r\n[62] Rev. Hugh Pearson, Rector of Sonning.\r\n\r\n[63] The house of William Wickham, who married my cousin Sophia Lefevre.\r\n\r\n[64] In 1884 this fine old property of the Needhams was sold to A. P.\r\nHeywood Lonsdale, Esq. (now Heywood), who is also owner of the\r\nneighbouring estate of Cloverly.\r\n\r\n[65] This old friend of my childhood died Dec. 1890, in her 99th year.\r\n\r\n[66]\r\n\r\n    “Andrew, she has a face looks like a story,\r\n     The story of the heavens looks very like her.”\r\n            BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER, _The Elder Brother_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[67] From “The Story of Two Noble Lives.”\r\n\r\n[67] Afterwards Lady Harcourt.\r\n\r\n[69] This is much like the epitaph which Ruskin has placed on the grave\r\nof his father.\r\n\r\n[70] A rich farmer, the landlord of our Lime farm at Hurstmonceaux.\r\n\r\n[71] Mrs. Harford of Blaise Castle, third daughter of Baron de Bunsen.\r\n\r\n[72] From “Northern Italy.”\r\n\r\n[73] From “Northern Italy.”\r\n\r\n[74] From “Northern Italy.”\r\n\r\n[75] Beatrice, afterwards the first wife of Charles Stuart Wortley.\r\n\r\n[76] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[77] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[78] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[79] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[80] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[81] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[82] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[83] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[84] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[85] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[86] Daughter of Lord Howard de Walden, afterwards Duchess of Sermoneta.\r\n\r\n[87] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[88] This excellent old Abbot was afterwards cruelly murdered at Rome.\r\n\r\n[89] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[90] From “Days near Rome.”\r\n\r\n[91] From “Florence.”\r\n\r\n[92] _All_ the women have fainted.\r\n\r\n[93] Sermon on Ezekiel.\r\n\r\n[94] From “Northern Italy.”\r\n\r\n[95] From “North-Eastern France.”\r\n\r\n[96] Afterwards known as “Sunday Hill.”\r\n\r\n[97] Fanny Blackett, Vicomtesse du Quaire, who died, universally beloved\r\nand regretted, in the spring of 1895.\r\n\r\n[98] Feb. 8, 1814.\r\n\r\n[99] Hon.

She died, deeply\r\nmourned and beloved, in 1891.\r\n\r\n[104] Author of “Rab and his Friends.”\r\n\r\n[105] Daughter of the 8th Earl of Cavan, afterwards Baroness von Essen.\r\n\r\n[106] From “The Story of Two Noble Lives.”\r\n\r\n[107] From “The Story of Two Noble Lives.”\r\n\r\n[108] John, second Duke of Argyll, immortalised by Pope.\r\n\r\n[109] Author of “Music and Morals,” &c.\r\n\r\n[110] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[111] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[112] From “Days near Paris.”\r\n\r\n[113] This was my first sight of the contentious and arbitrary essayist\r\nAbraham Hayward, whom I often saw afterwards. He was always interesting\r\nto meet, if only on account of his perverse acerbity. Constantly invited\r\nby a world which feared him, he was always determined to be listened to,\r\nand generally said something worth hearing.\r\n\r\n[114] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[115] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[116] Lady Victoria Liddell married Captain Edward Fisher, now Rowe.\r\n\r\n[117] John FitzPatrick, Baron Castletown of Upper Ossory.\r\n\r\n[118] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[119] Emily, wife of the 5th Earl Stanhope, died Dec. 31, 1873.\r\n\r\n[120] Evelyn Henrietta, daughter of R.

She married\r\nEdward, only son of the famous Lord Edward FitzGerald and of the\r\nbeautiful Pamela. She lived till November 1891.\r\n\r\n[125] The family circle was broken up by the death of Mr. Carew in 1888,\r\na few months after that of his eldest daughter.\r\n\r\n[126] I learnt to value Dean Church very much afterwards. The story of\r\nhis beautiful and noble life is told in a wonderfully interesting\r\n“Memoir.”\r\n\r\n[127] William, afterwards 4th Earl of St. Germans, died Oct. 7, 1877.\r\n\r\n[128] Edward Granville, 3rd Earl of St. Germans, died 1877.\r\n\r\n[129] George, second son of the 2nd Earl of Mount Edgcumbe, married\r\nFanny Lucy, eldest daughter of Sir John Shelley.\r\n\r\n[130] Sophia, daughter of the 2nd Earl of Buckinghamshire.\r\n\r\n[131] Hugh, 3rd Earl Fortescue.\r\n\r\n[132] The Queen of the Gipsies died in July 1883, at the age of\r\neighty-six.\r\n\r\n[133] Her mother, Lady Stuart de Rothesay, was daughter of the 3rd Earl\r\nof Hardwicke.\r\n\r\n[134] Charles, 3rd Earl of Somers.\r\n\r\n[135] George Guy Greville, 4th Earl of Warwick, died Dec. 2, 1893.\r\n\r\n[136] I afterwards heard the same story, almost in the same words, from\r\nLord Warwick himself.\r\n\r\n[137] from “The Story of Two Noble Lives.”\r\n\r\n[138] From “The Story of Two Noble Lives.”\r\n\r\n[139] Bk. vi. 73, 74.\r\n\r\n[140] Anne, wife of the 4th Earl of Warwick, daughter of Francis, 8th\r\nEarl of Wemyss and March.\r\n\r\n[141] My mother’s first cousin, Georgiana Liddell, had married Lord\r\nBloomfield, formerly ambassador at Berlin and Vienna.\r\n\r\n[142] From “The Story of Two Noble Lives.”\r\n\r\n[143] I have heard Professor Owen tell this story himself.\r\n\r\n[144] Louisa, fourth daughter of 2nd Earl of Lucan.\r\n\r\n[145] John Patrick, 3rd Marquis of Bute.\r\n\r\n[146] Gwendoline Mary-Anne, eldest daughter of Lord Howard of Glossop.\r\n\r\n[147] Prior.\r\n\r\n[148] Sir Hedworth and Lady Elizabeth Williamson.

Throughout his\r\nfriendship with her, the perfect reserve of a great gentleman and great\r\nlady was never broken.\r\n\r\n[151] In 1879 I told this story to the Crown Prince of Sweden and\r\nNorway, who took the trouble to verify facts and dates as to the\r\nLöwenjelms, &c., and found everything coincide.\r\n\r\n[152] Mrs., then Lady Pease, died, universally beloved and regretted, in\r\n1892.\r\n\r\n[153] The 6th Earl of Fitzwilliam.\r\n\r\n[154] Lady Frances Douglas, daughter of the 18th Earl of Morton.\r\n\r\n[155] Eldest daughter and youngest son of Viscount Halifax.\r\n\r\n[156] Edward Carr Glyn, afterwards Vicar of Kensington, son of the 1st\r\nBaron Wolverton.\r\n\r\n[157] Mother of the 9th Duke of Bedford, a most charming and hospitable\r\nperson. She died August 1874.\r\n\r\n[158] Lord Moira was created Marquis of Hastings 1816, and died at\r\nMalta, November 26, 1826.\r\n\r\n[159] “In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth\r\nupon men, in slumberings upon the bed; then He openeth the ears of men,\r\nand sealeth their instruction.”--_Elihu in Job._\r\n\r\n[160] Charles, 2nd Earl Grey.\r\n\r\n[161] I have since heard this story as told by a Captain Campbell, and\r\nas having happened in Ireland near the Curragh. A similar story is told\r\nof two officers invited to the house of a Mr. T. near Dorchester. The\r\nappearance of the hostess at dinner was excused on plea of illness, and\r\nthe younger guest, staring at the place where she would have sat,\r\nimplored his elder friend to get him away from this devil-haunted place.\r\nAn excuse of early parade was made, and as they were returning over the\r\nhills, the young man described the figure of “a lady with dripping hair\r\nwringing her hands.” Soon afterwards her body was found in the moat of\r\nthe house. It was Mrs. T.\r\n\r\n[162] My old schoolfellow, George, Equerry to the Prince of Wales, only\r\nson of the Right Hon. Sir George Grey.\r\n\r\n[163] Anthony Lionel Ashley, died Jan. 14, 1836.\r\n\r\n[164] I afterwards heard this story confirmed in every particular by\r\nLord Waterford’s widow.\r\n\r\n[165] From “Central Italy.”\r\n\r\n[166] Miss Wright\r\n\r\n[167] Whose real name is Cincinnatus.\r\n\r\n[168] From “Northern Italy.”\r\n\r\n[169] From “Northern Italy.”\r\n\r\n[170] From “Central Italy.”\r\n\r\n[171] From “Central Italy.”\r\n\r\n[172] From “Florence.”\r\n\r\n[173] From “Florence.”\r\n\r\n[174] From “Northern Italy.”\r\n\r\n[175] From “Northern Italy.”\r\n\r\n[176] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[177] He died March 1888.\r\n\r\n[178] Dante Gabriel Rossetti.\r\n\r\n[179] Professor Forster has since assured me that this was impossible,\r\nfor that hair will only continue to grow for a few hours after death.\r\n\r\n[180] Daughter of the famous English tenor, John Braham.\r\n\r\n[181] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[182] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[183] From “The Story of Two Noble Lives.”\r\n\r\n[184] From “The Story of Two Noble Lives.”\r\n\r\n[185] Story told me by Sir J. Shaw Lefevre.\r\n\r\n[186] Afterwards Sir Charles Newton. He died Nov. 28, 1894.\r\n\r\n[187] I need scarcely say that, as soon as possible thereafter, I\r\neliminated all reference to Mr. Freeman, and all quotations from his\r\nworks, from my books.\r\n\r\n[188] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[189] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[190] Tom Taylor, editor of _Punch_, died 1880.\r\n\r\n[191] _Née_ Sabine Thellusson.\r\n\r\n[192] Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\n[193] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[194] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[195] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[196] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[197] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[198] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[199] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[200] William Reginald Courtenay, 12th Earl of Devon.\r\n\r\n[201] Sir Samuel Baker died Dec. 1893.\r\n\r\n[202] This picture was sold to the National Gallery in 1880 for £9000,\r\nand is probably the cheapest purchase the Gallery ever made.\r\n\r\n[203] Isabella, second daughter of Lord Henry Howard.\r\n\r\n[204] Mr. Abraham Hayward, the well-known critic and essayist, who had\r\nbeen articled in early life to an obscure country attorney, always\r\nseemed to consider it the _summum-bonum_ of life to dwell amongst the\r\naristocracy as a man of letters: and in this he succeeded admirably, and\r\nwas always witty and well-informed, usually satirical, and often very\r\ncoarse.\r\n\r\n[205] Fourth son of the 4th Earl of Clarendon.\r\n\r\n[206] Eldest sister of Prince Christian.\r\n\r\n[207] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[208] Many years afterwards I saw her again: her name was Mrs. Macnabb.\r\n\r\n[209] Lord Russell died May 28, 1878.\r\n\r\n[210] Lady Gladys afterwards married the 4th Earl of Lonsdale.\r\n\r\n[211] My mother’s first cousin, Susan, sixth daughter of the 1st Lord\r\nRavensworth.\r\n\r\n[212] Eliot Yorke died Dec. 21, 1878--a bitter family sorrow.\r\n\r\n[213] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[214] Anne-Florence, Baroness Lucas, Dowager Countess Cowper, elder\r\ndaughter and co-heir of Thomas Philip, Earl De Grey. She died in 1880.\r\n\r\n[215] _P.S._--The unpublished letters of Lady Mary Cooke show that this\r\nlocal tradition is incorrect. Lord Tavistock’s accident occurred far\r\naway, and he lingered afterwards for three weeks; but it is true that\r\nthe family never lived at Houghton after his death.\r\n\r\n[216] Lord Hinton afterwards used to play a barrel-organ in the streets\r\nof London, with an inscription over it in large letters, “I am the only\r\nViscount Hinton.” He would play it for hours opposite the windows of\r\nLord Powlett in Berkeley Square.\r\n\r\n[217] Mr. E. A. Freeman--whose lengthy and disproportionate writings\r\nwere never wholly without interest--died March 1892.\r\n\r\n[218] Blanche, Countess of Sandwich, died March 1894.\r\n\r\n[219] Letters of Alexis de Tocqueville to Mrs. Grote.\r\n\r\n[220] Sir John Acton was commander-in-chief of the land and sea forces\r\nof Naples, and was for several years Neapolitan Prime Minister. His wife\r\nwas the daughter of his brother, General Acton, and he had by her two\r\nsons (the younger of whom became Cardinal), and a daughter, afterwards\r\nLady Throckmorton.\r\n\r\n[221] At Sudeley Castle, where “the Mother of the English Reformation”\r\nis buried, I wrote for Mrs. Dent:--\r\n\r\n    “Here, within the chapel’s shade,\r\n     Reverent hands have gently laid,\r\n     From the suffering of her life,\r\n     From its storminess and strife,\r\n     All that rests of one who shone\r\n     For a time on England’s throne,\r\n     Ever gentle, ever kind,\r\n     Seeking human souls to bind\r\n     In a Christian’s fetters fast,\r\n     Heavenward leading at the last:\r\n     And their watch two angels keep\r\n     Over Katherine’s gentle sleep.\r\n\r\n     Oh! amid this world of ours,\r\n     With its sunshine and its flowers,\r\n     Glad with light and blest with love,\r\n     Let us still so live above\r\n     All earth’s jealousies and snares,\r\n     All its fretfulness and cares,\r\n     Ever faithful, ever true,\r\n     With the noblest end in view,\r\n     Seeking human souls to raise\r\n     By the simplest, purest ways;\r\n     Then their ward will angels keep\r\n     When we too are hush’d to sleep.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[222] Emma, daughter of John Brocklehurst, Esq., of Hurdsfield, the\r\nauthoress of an admirable work on the “Annals of Winchcombe and\r\nSudeley.”\r\n\r\n[223] The great feature in views from Stoke Rectory.\r\n\r\n[224] The name is thus spelt in the epitaph on the tomb of Richard\r\nPendrill at St. Giles in the Fields.\r\n\r\n[225] Henry Strutt, who succeeded his father as 2nd Lord Belper in 1880,\r\nmarried Lady Margaret, sixth daughter of the 2nd Earl of Leicester.\r\n\r\n[226] Frederick Arthur, second son of the 14th Earl of Derby, married\r\nConstance, eldest daughter of the 4th Earl of Clarendon.\r\n\r\n[227] He succeeded his grandfather as 5th Viscount Gage in 1877.\r\n\r\n[228] Frederick, third son of the 6th Earl of Tankerville.

Cordy Jeaffreson (“Book of Recollections”) gives a most\r\nattractive account of this lady, which may be summed up in his dictum\r\n“It is impossible for a daughter of Eve to be a better woman than\r\nGeraldine Jewsbury.”\r\n\r\n[259] Elizabeth Jane, daughter of the first Lord Athlumney.\r\n\r\n[260] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[261] Helen Matilda, daughter of Rev.

She never recovered the\r\nfatigue of a visit to the Pope. It was all made as easy as possible for\r\nher, on account of her great age, and the Duke of Norfolk was allowed to\r\nbring her in separately. “Adieu! we shall meet again in heaven,” said\r\nLeo XIII., on taking leave of her: a fortnight after she was dead.\r\n\r\n[299] I have not been able to do this, as there is a prohibition in\r\nEngland against wearing foreign orders, dating from Elizabeth, who said,\r\n“My dogs shall wear nothing but my own collars.”\r\n\r\n[300] I little thought at the time that Frank Crawford would turn out a\r\ndistinguished and popular novelist: it was at Bombay that he met the\r\noriginal of “Mr. Isaacs.”\r\n\r\n[301] The Misses Monk, daughters of the Bishop of Gloucester and\r\nBristol.\r\n\r\n[302] Miss Clarke.\r\n\r\n[303] From “South-Eastern France.”\r\n\r\n[304] Of very humble origin himself, to court great personages had been\r\nthe ruling passion of his life, and it had been a subject of extravagant\r\npride to him that he had occasionally entertained this good-natured\r\nPrincess at dinner at Pau.\r\n\r\n[305] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[306] I often saw Mademoiselle Bernhardt act afterwards, and was far\r\nless impressed by her, feeling the truth of the expression “Une\r\ntragédienne du Boulevard.”\r\n\r\n[307] With whom afterwards I became great friends.\r\n\r\n[308] The story of Count Piper is curious and highly honourable to him.\r\nHe discovered that the late King Carl XV. was going to make a most\r\nunworthy and disgraceful marriage, and he wrote to him most strongly\r\nupon the subject. The king never forgave him, and made it impossible for\r\nhim to stay in Sweden, but the cause of his disgrace was unknown, till\r\nthe present king, Oscar, found the letter among his brother’s papers\r\nafter his death. Count Piper was at once recalled, and given first-rate\r\ndiplomatic posts.\r\n\r\n[309] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[310] From “Walks in London.”\r\n\r\n[311] Daughter of John Braham, the singer.

Vivier told Madame du Quaire that, when he first went to\r\nsee Mrs. Grote, he found her sitting high aloft in a tree, dressed in a\r\ncoachman’s brown greatcoat with capes, playing on the violoncello.\r\n\r\n[356] Mr. Grote was ever imperturbably placid. When Jenny Lind was asked\r\nwhat she thought of Mr. Grote, she said he was “like a fine old bust in\r\na corner which one longed to dust.” Mrs. Grote dusted him.\r\n\r\n[357] This was my last sight of Lady Ruthven, who died April 5, 1885,\r\naged 96.\r\n\r\n[358] “Pensées Philosophiques,” 1747.\r\n\r\n[359] Since republished in “Biographical Sketches.”\r\n\r\n[360] The Stanleys’ dear old nurse.\r\n\r\n[361] From “Biographical Sketches.”\r\n\r\n[362] Lord Romilly perished in his burning house in Egerton Gardens,\r\nLondon, in May 1891, having never recovered the death of his most sweet\r\nwife several years before.\r\n\r\n[363] Hon.

She liked\r\nto see people to the last. Every Sunday and Tuesday she admitted all who\r\ncame to her as long as she could; then she saw a portion: up to the last\r\nfew weeks she saw one or two. As Landor says, “She warmed both hands\r\nbefore the fire of life, and when it sank she was ready to depart.”\r\n\r\nOne day a young man remonstrated with Mrs. Procter for not going to see\r\nan exhibition of Sir Joshuas which was open at that time. “I have seen\r\nthem all,” she said. “Why, Mrs. Procter, there has never been such an\r\nexhibition before.”--“I beg your pardon; there has been.”--“Why,\r\nwhen?”--“In 1808, and--_where were you then_?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Procter used to tell how she had been at the jubilee of George\r\nIII., and would add that if she could see the jubilee of Queen Victoria\r\nshe would say her “Nunc Dimittis;” and she did see it, and the Queen\r\nexpressed a wish that Mrs. Procter, who was invited to her garden-party,\r\nshould be especially presented to her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Procter--Anne Benson Procter--was born Sept. 11, 1799, being the\r\ndaughter of Mr. Skepper, a small Yorkshire squire. Her mother, a Benson,\r\nwho was aunt of the Archbishop of Canterbury of that name, married, as\r\nher second husband, Basil Montagu, Q.C. In 1823, Miss Skepper married\r\nBryan Waller Procter, known as Barry Cornwall, described by Patmore as a\r\n“simple, sincere, shy, and delicate soul,” well known to his\r\ncontemporaries by his songs set to music by popular composers. He died\r\nin 1874.\r\n\r\n[457] _Née_ Janet Duff Gordon.\r\n\r\n[458] Second daughter of the 1st Earl of Kilmorey, aged 95.\r\n\r\n[459] Henry Cowper, than whom no one was a more universal favourite, or\r\nmore deservedly so, died a few months after this.\r\n\r\n[460] Afterwards Lady Swansea.\r\n\r\n[461] Third son of the 4th Earl of Aberdeen, married Ellen, 2nd daughter\r\nof the 19th Earl of Morton.\r\n\r\n[462] Lady Gertrude Talbot, daughter of the 18th Earl of Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\n[463] Esquire being written as well as Reverend, is supposed to have\r\nbeen intended to indicate the son of a baronet.\r\n\r\n[464] In 1890 Mr. Pigott died, and the new Rector destroyed the\r\ncharacter of Bemerton by adding largely to the rectory in red brick.\r\n\r\n[465] The Earl of Caledon’s place in Hertfordshire.\r\n\r\n[466] The 16th Earl, father of the Princesses Doria and Borghese.\r\n\r\n[467] Browning.\r\n\r\n[468] From “North-Western France.”\r\n\r\n[469] Sir John Saville’s.\r\n\r\n[470] Harry George Powlett, 4th Duke of Cleveland, who died August 21,\r\n1891.\r\n\r\n[471] Afterwards Duchess of Portland.\r\n\r\n[472] Louisa, daughter of Henry Drummond, Esq., died 1890.\r\n\r\n[473] Algernon-George, 6th Duke of Northumberland.\r\n\r\n[474] How well I remember, when somebody remonstrated with Lady Marian\r\nfor “burning the candle at both ends,” the quickness with which she\r\nanswered--“Why, I thought that was the very way to make two ends meet.”\r\n\r\n[475] Her father, Benjamin Bathurst (third son of Henry Bathurst, Bishop\r\nof Norwich), travelling as envoy from the British Government to the\r\nEmperor Francis, was about to enter his carriage at the door of the Swan\r\nInn at Perleberg, between Berlin and Hamburg, when he disappeared and\r\nwas _never heard of again_. Her brother was killed by a fall from his\r\nhorse in a race at Rome.

How long Christ\r\nwas silent before He spoke, and how little He then said.”--_Carlyle, in\r\nReid’s Life of Lord Houghton._\r\n\r\n[491] A passage in Richard Kurd’s Sermons (vol. ii.), which I had read\r\nlong ago, would come back to me during this terrible hour. “In this\r\nawfully stupendous manner, at which Reason stands aghast, and Faith\r\nherself is half-confounded, was the grace of God to man at length\r\nmanifested.”\r\n\r\n[492] John Inglesant.\r\n\r\n[493] Paul Verlaine.\r\n\r\n[494] The birth of John, Henry, and Thomas Palmer is perhaps the only\r\nwell-authenticated instance of a fortnight intervening between the\r\neldest and the youngest child produced at a birth. It is described by\r\nFuller. Their mother was Alice, daughter of John Clement. Sir Henry lost\r\nhis life in the defence of Guisnes, of which he was governor.
