Some\r\nof it is quite new. Her own _Autobiography_ was completed in 1855; and\r\nthere has not hitherto been anything at all worth calling a record of\r\nthe twenty-one years during which she lived and worked after that date.\r\nEven as regards the earlier period, although, of course I have drawn\r\nlargely for facts upon the _Autobiography_, yet I have found much that\r\nis new to relate. For some information and hints about this period I am\r\nindebted to her relatives of her own generation, Dr. James Martineau,\r\nand Mrs. Henry Turner, of Nottingham, as well as to one or two others.\r\nWith reference to the latest twenty-one years of her life, my record is\r\nentirely fresh, though necessarily brief. Mrs. Chapman, of Boston,\r\nU.S.A., has written a volume in completion of the _Autobiography_,\r\nwhich should have covered this later period; but her account is little\r\nmore than a repetition, in a peculiar style, of the story that Miss\r\nMartineau herself had told, and leaves the later work of the life\r\nwithout systematic record. As a well-known critic remarked in\r\n_Macmillan_--\"This volume is one more illustration of the folly of\r\nintrusting the composition of biography to persons who have only the\r\nwholly irrelevant claim of intimate friendship.\" But it should be\r\nremembered that when Miss Martineau committed to Mrs. Chapman the task\r\nof writing a memorial sketch, and when the latter accepted the\r\nundertaking, both of them believed that the life and work of the\r\nsubject of it were practically over. I have reason to know that if\r\nHarriet Martineau had supposed it to be even remotely possible that so\r\nmuch of her life remained to be spent and recorded, she would have\r\nchosen some one more skilled in literature, and more closely acquainted\r\nwith English literary and political affairs, to complete her \"Life.\"\r\nHaving once asked Mrs. Chapman to fulfill the task, however, Harriet\r\nMartineau was too loyal and generous a friend to remove it from her\r\ncharge; and Mrs. Chapman, on her side, while continually begging\r\ninstructions from her subject as to what she was to say, and while\r\ndoubtless aware that she would not be adequate to the undertaking which\r\nhad grown so since she accepted it, yet would not throw it off her\r\nhands. But her volume is in no degree a record of those last years,\r\nwhich constitute nearly a third of Harriet Martineau's whole life. I\r\nhave had to seek facts and impressions about that period almost\r\nentirely from other sources.\r\n\r\nMy deepest obligations are due, and must be first expressed, to Mr.\r\nHenry G. Atkinson, the dearest friend of Harriet Martineau's maturity.\r\nIt is commonly known that she forbade, by her will, the publication of\r\nher private letters; but she showed her supreme faith in and value for\r\nher friend, Mr. Atkinson, by specially exempting him from such\r\nprohibition. Her objection to the publication of letters was made on\r\ngeneral grounds. Her own letters are singularly beautiful specimens of\r\ntheir class; and she declared that she would not mind if every word\r\nthat ever she wrote were published; but she looked upon it as a duty to\r\nuphold the principle that letters should be held sacred confidences,\r\njust as all honorable people hold private conversations, not to be\r\npublished without leave. But in authorizing Mr. Atkinson to print her\r\nletters, if he pleased, she maintained that she was not departing from\r\nthis principle; for it was only the same as it would be if two friends\r\nagreed to make their conversation known. I feel deeply grateful to Mr.\r\nAtkinson for allowing me the privilege of presenting some of her\r\nletters to the public in this volume, and of perusing very many more.\r\n\r\nI have been permitted, also, to read a vast number of Harriet\r\nMartineau's letters addressed to other friends besides Mr. Atkinson,\r\nand how much they have aided me in the following work and in\r\nappreciating her personality, may easily be guessed; but, of course, I\r\nmay not publish these letters. Amongst many persons to whom I am\r\nindebted for helping me to \"get touch\" with my subject in this way, I\r\nmust specially thank two. Mr. Henry Reeve, the editor of the _Edinburgh\r\nReview_, was a relative and intimate friend of Harriet Martineau; and\r\nher correspondence with so distinguished a man of letters was,\r\nnaturally, peculiarly interesting--not the less so because they\r\ndiffered altogether on many matters of opinion. Her letters, which Mr.\r\nReeve has kindly allowed me to see, have been of very great service to\r\nme. Miss F. Arnold, of Fox How, (the youngest daughter of Dr. Arnold,\r\nof Rugby,) is the second to whom like particular acknowledgments is\r\ndue. She was young enough to have been Harriet Martineau's daughter;\r\nbut she was also a beloved friend, and was almost a daily visitor at\r\n\"The Knoll\" during the later years of Miss Martineau's life. The\r\nletters which Miss Arnold, during occasional absences from home,\r\nreceived from her old friend, are very domestic, lively, and\r\ncharacteristic of the writer. It has been of great value to me to have\r\nseen all the letters that have been lent me, but especially these two\r\nsets, so different and yet so similar as I have found them to be.\r\n\r\nI have visited Norwich, and seen the house where Harriet Martineau was\r\nborn; Tynemouth, where she lay ill; Ambleside, where she lived so long\r\nand died at last; and Birmingham, to see my valued friends, her nieces\r\nand nephew. If I should thank by name all with whom I have talked of\r\nher, and from whom I have learned something about her, the list would\r\ngrow over-long; and so I must content myself with thus comprehensively\r\nexpressing my sense of individual obligations to all who have laid even\r\na small stone to this little memorial cairn.\r\n\r\nF.

Many who thus settled in our midst were amongst the\r\nmost skillful and industrious workers, of various grades, that could\r\nhave been found in the dominions of the persecuting king who drove\r\nthem forth. They must have been, too, in the nature of the case,\r\nstrong-hearted, clear in the comprehension of their principles, and\r\ntruthful and conscientious about matters of opinion; for the\r\ncowardly, the weak, and the false could stay in their own land. From\r\nthe good stock of these exiles for conscience-sake sprang Harriet\r\nMartineau.\r\n\r\nHer paternal Huguenot ancestor was a surgeon, who was married to a\r\nfellow-countrywoman and co-religionist of the name of Pierre. This\r\ncouple of exiles for freedom of opinion settled in Norwich, where the\r\nhusband pursued his profession. Their descendants supplied a constant\r\nsuccession of highly-respected surgeons to the same town, without\r\nintermission, until the early part of this century, when the line of\r\nmedical practitioners was closed by the death of Harriet Martineau's\r\nelder brother at less than thirty years old. The Martineau family thus\r\nlong occupied a good professional position in the town of Norwich.\r\n\r\nHarriet's father, however, was not a surgeon, but a manufacturer\r\nof stuffs, the very names of which are now strange in our\r\nears--bombazines and camlets. His wife was Elizabeth Rankin, the\r\ndaughter of a sugar-refiner of Newcastle-on-Tyne. A true Northumbrian\r\nwoman was Mrs. Martineau; with a strong sense of duty, but little\r\nwarmth of temperament; with the faults of an imperious disposition,\r\nand its correlative virtues of self-reliance and strength of will.\r\nThese qualities become abundantly apparent in her in the story of her\r\nrelationship with her famous daughter. On both sides, therefore,\r\nHarriet Martineau was endowed by hereditary descent with the strong\r\nqualities--the power, the clear-headedness, and the keen\r\nconscience--which she interfused into all the work of her life.\r\n\r\nThomas and Elizabeth Martineau, her father and mother, were the parents\r\nof eight children, two of whom became widely known and influential as\r\nthinkers and writers. Harriet was the sixth of the family, and was born\r\nat Norwich, in Magdalen street, on the 12th of June, 1802, the mother\r\nbeing at that time thirty years old. The next child, born in 1805, was\r\nthe boy who grew up to become known as Dr. James Martineau; so that the\r\ntwo who were to make the family name famous were next to each other in\r\nage. Another child followed in this family group, but not until 1811,\r\nwhen Harriet was nine years old, so that she could experience with\r\nreference to this baby some of that tender, protective affection which\r\nis such an education for elder children, and so delightful to girls\r\nwith strong maternal instincts such as she possessed.\r\n\r\nThe sixth child in a family of eight is likely to be a personage of but\r\nsmall consequence. The parents' pride has been somewhat satiated by\r\nprevious experiences of the wonders of the dawning faculties of their\r\nchildren; and the indulgence which seems naturally given to \"the baby\"\r\ngets comparatively soon transferred from poor number six to that\r\ninterloper number seven. Mrs. Martineau, too, was one of that sort of\r\nwomen who, as they would say, do not \"spoil\" their children. Ready to\r\nwork for them, to endure for them, to struggle to provide them with all\r\nnecessary comforts, and even with pleasures, at the cost, if need be,\r\nof personal sacrifice of comfort and pleasure, such mothers yet do not\r\ngive to their children that bountiful outpouring of tender, caressing,\r\nmaternal love, which the young as much require for their due and free\r\ngrowth as plants do the floods of the summer sunshine. To starve the\r\nemotions in a child is not less cruel than to stint its body of food.\r\nTo repress and chain up the feelings is to impose as great a hardship\r\nas it would be to fetter the freedom of the limbs. Mothers who have\r\nlabored and suffered through long years for the welfare of their\r\nchildren, are often grieved and pained in after days to find themselves\r\nregarded with respect rather than with fondness; but it was they\r\nthemselves who put the seal upon the fountains of affection at the time\r\nwhen they might have been opened freely--and whose fault is it if,\r\nlater, the outflow is found to be checked for evermore?\r\n\r\nThe pity of it is that such mischief is often wrought by parents who\r\nlove their children intensely, but who err in the management of them\r\nfor want of the wisdom of the heart, the power of sympathetic feeling,\r\nwhich is seen so much stronger sometimes in comparatively shallow\r\nnatures than in the deeper ones that have really more of love and of\r\nself-sacrifice in their souls. Those who lack tenderness either of\r\nmanner or feeling, those to whom the full and free expression of\r\naffection is difficult or seems a folly, may perhaps be led to reflect,\r\nby the story of Harriet Martineau's childhood, on the suffering and\r\nerror that may result from a neglect of the moral command: \"Parents,\r\nprovoke not your children to wrath.\"\r\n\r\n\"My life has had no spring,\" wrote Harriet Martineau, sadly; yet there\r\nwas nothing in the outer circumstances of her childhood and youth to\r\njustify this feeling. Her mother's temper and character were largely\r\nresponsible for what Harriet calls her \"habit of misery\" during\r\nchildhood. It is right to explain, however, that this unhappiness was\r\ndoubtless partly due to physical causes. She was a weakly child, her\r\nhealth having been undermined by the dishonesty of the wet nurse\r\nemployed for her during the first three months of her life. The woman\r\nlost her milk, and managed to conceal the fact until the baby was found\r\nto be in an almost dying condition from the consequences of want of\r\nnourishment. How far her frequent ill-health, during many succeeding\r\nyears, was to be ascribed to this cannot be known; but her mother\r\nnaturally attributed all Harriet's delicacy of health to this cause,\r\neven the deafness from which she suffered, although this did not become\r\npronounced till she was over twelve years of age.\r\n\r\nHer deafness, which was the most commonly known of her deficiencies of\r\nsensation, was not her earliest deprivation of a sense. She was never\r\nable to smell, that she could remember; and as smell and taste are\r\nintimately joined together, and a large part of what we believe to be\r\nflavor is really odor, it naturally followed that she was also nearly\r\ndestitute of the sense of taste. Thus two of the avenues by which the\r\nmind receives impressions from the outer world were closed to her all\r\nher life, and a third was also stopped before she reached womanhood.\r\nThe senses are the gates by which pleasure as well as pain enter into\r\nthe citadel where consciousness resides. Of all the senses, those which\r\nmost frequently give entrance to pleasure and seldomest to pain, were\r\nthose which she had lost. \"When three senses out of five are\r\ndeficient,\" as she said, \"the difficulty of cheerful living is great,\r\nand the terms of life are truly hard.\"\r\n\r\nShe suffered greatly, even as a little child, from indigestion. Milk\r\nin particular disagreed with her; but it was held essential by Mrs.\r\nMartineau that children should eat bread and milk, and for years poor\r\nHarriet endured daily a lump at her chest and an oppression of the\r\nspirits, induced by her inability to digest her breakfast and supper.\r\nNightmares and causeless apprehensions in the day also afflicted the\r\nnervous and sensitive girl, and she had \"hardly any respite from\r\nterror.\"\r\n\r\nA child so delicate in health could not have been very happy under any\r\nhome conditions. Only a truly wise and tender maternal guardianship\r\ncould have made the life of such an one at all tolerable; but Harriet\r\nMartineau was one of the large family of a sharp-tempered, masterful,\r\nstern, though devoted mother, whose cleverness found vent in incessant\r\nsarcasm, and in whom the love of power natural to a capable, determined\r\nperson degenerated, as it so often does in domestic life, into a severe\r\ndespotism.\r\n\r\nMrs. Martineau's circumstances were such as to increase her natural\r\ntendency to stern and decided rule. Dr. Martineau tells me that all\r\nwho knew his mother feel that Harriet does not do justice in her\r\n\"Autobiography\" to that mother's nobler qualities, both moral and\r\nintellectual, and especially the latter. Harriet and James Martineau,\r\nlike so many other men and women of mark, were the children of a mother\r\nof uncommon mental capacity. Her business faculties were so good, and\r\nher judgment so clear, that her husband (a man of a sweet and gentle\r\ndisposition) invariably took counsel with her about all his affairs,\r\nand acted by her advice. There are still inhabitants of Norwich who\r\nremember Mrs. Martineau, and their testimony of her is identical with\r\nher son's. \"She was the ruling spirit in that house,\" says one of them.\r\n\"Whatever was done there, you understood that it was she who did it.\"\r\nThe way in which this gentleman came to know so much of her\r\ncorroborates Dr. Martineau's declaration that \"she was really devoted\r\nto her children, and would do anything for them; if we were miserable\r\nin our childhood (a fact which he does not dispute) it could not be\r\nsaid to be consciously her fault.\" Mr. ---- was the husband of a lady\r\nwho had been reared from early childhood by Mrs. Martineau, having been\r\nadopted by her simply in order to provide her little daughter, Ellen,\r\nwho was nine years younger than Harriet, with a child companion\r\nsomewhat about her own age. This lady, her widowed husband tells me,\r\nretained a most warm admiration and affection for Mrs. Martineau.\r\nMothers who have brought up eight children of their own can appreciate\r\nthe self-devotedness of this mother in receiving a ninth child by\r\nadoption in order to increase the well-being of her own little\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nSeveral other instances were told to me of Mrs. Martineau's benevolence\r\nand kindness of disposition. Young men belonging to her religious body,\r\nand living in lodgings in Norwich, were uniformly made welcome to her\r\nhouse, as a home, every Sunday evening. One of the Norwich residents,\r\nwith whom I have talked about her, received a presentation from her to\r\nthe Unitarian Free School, and afterwards, in his school life, met with\r\nconstant encouragement and patronage at her hands. He tells me that he\r\nhas never forgotten the stately and impressive address with which she\r\ngave him the presentation ticket, concluding with a reminder that if he\r\nmade good use of this opportunity he might even hope one day to become\r\na member of the Town Council of that city,--and at that giddy eminence\r\nher _protege_ now stands.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of the lesson, it should be understood that she was thus\r\ntruly benevolent and kindly, and no vulgar termagant or scold. It is\r\nfor us to see how such a nature can be spoiled for daily life by too\r\nunchecked a course of arbitrary rule, and by repression of outward\r\nsigns of tenderness.\r\n\r\nNot the least evil which a stern parent, who maintains a reserve of\r\ndemeanor, and who requires strictness of discipline within the home,\r\nmay do to himself and his children, is that by denying expression to\r\nthe children's feelings he closes to himself the possibility of knowing\r\nwhat goes on in their young minds. Thus, a child so restrained may for\r\nyears suffer under a sense of injustice, and of undue favoritism shown\r\nto another, or under a belief that the parent's love is lacking, when a\r\nfew words might have cleared away the misapprehension, and given the\r\nchild the natural happiness of its age.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of her childhood, Harriet says: \"I had a devouring passion\r\nfor justice; justice, first, to my own precious self, and then to\r\nother oppressed people. Justice was precisely what was least understood\r\nin our house, in regard to servants and children. Now and then I\r\ndesperately poured out my complaints; but in general I brooded over\r\nmy injuries and those of others who dared not speak, and then the\r\ntemptation to suicide was very strong.\"\r\n\r\nThe most vivid picture that she has drawn of the discipline under which\r\nsuch emotions were induced in her is found in a story, _The Crofton\r\nBoys_, which she wrote during a severe illness, and under the\r\nimpression that it would contain her last words uttered through the\r\npress. Mrs. Proctor, in _The Crofton Boys_, is depicted with remarkable\r\nvividness by a series of little touches, and in a succession of trivial\r\ndetails, with an avoidance of direct description, that reminds us of\r\nthe method of Jane Austen. Harriet never achieved any other portrait of\r\na character such as this one; for this is treated with such minute\r\nfidelity, and such evident unconsciousness, that we feel sure, as we\r\nsometimes do with a picture, that the likeness must be an exact one. So\r\ndistinct an individuality is shown to us, and at the same time, the\r\nevidences of the artist's close and careful observation of his model\r\nare so obvious, that, without having seen the subject, we _feel_ the\r\naccuracy of the likeness. So does the \"portrait of a mother\" in that\r\ntale which Harriet wrote for her last words through the press, show us\r\nthe nature of Mrs. Martineau in her maternal relation.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Proctor so seldom praised anybody that her words of esteem went a\r\ngreat way.... Everyone in the house was in the habit of hiding tears\r\nfrom Mrs. Proctor, who rarely shed them herself, and was known to think\r\nthat they might generally be suppressed, and should be so.\"\r\n\r\nIf any person were weak enough to express emotion in this way in\r\nher presence, Mrs. Proctor would promptly and sternly intimate her\r\ndisapproval of such indulgence of the feelings. When the little lad was\r\nleaving home for the first time, all the rest of the household became a\r\nlittle unhappy over the parting.\r\n\r\n\"Susan came in about the cord for his box, and her eyes were red,--and\r\nat the sight of her Agnes began to cry again; and Jane bent down over\r\nthe glove she was mending for him, and her needle stopped.\r\n\r\n\"'Jane,' said her mother, gravely, 'if you are not mending that glove,\r\ngive it to me. It is getting late.'\r\n\r\n\"Jane brushed her hand across her eyes, and stitched away again. Then\r\nshe threw the gloves to Hugh without looking at him, and ran to get\r\nready to go to the coach.\"\r\n\r\nSo little allowance was ordinarily made in that house for signs of\r\naffection, or manifestations of personal attachment, that the child who\r\nwas going away for six months was \"amazed to find that his sisters were\r\ngiving up an hour of their lessons that they might go with him to the\r\ncoach.\" Even when Hugh got his foot so crushed it had to be amputated,\r\nthough his mother came to him and gave him every proper attention, yet\r\n\"Hugh saw no tears from her\"; nothing more than that \"her face was very\r\npale and grave.\" His anticipations of her coming had not been warm; his\r\none anxiety had been that he might bear his pain resolutely before her.\r\n\"As Hugh cried, he said he bore it so very badly he did not know what\r\nhis mother would say if she saw him.\" And it was well that he had not\r\nanticipated any outburst of pity or expression of sympathy from her,\r\nfor, when she did come, \"she kissed him with a long, long kiss; but she\r\ndid not speak.\" Her first words in the hearing of her agonized child\r\nwere spoken to give him an intimation that the surgeons were waiting to\r\ntake off his foot. The boy's reply was--not to cling to her for\r\nsupport, and to nestle in her bosom for comfort in the most terrible\r\nmoment of his young life, but--\"Do not stay now; this pain is so bad! I\r\ncan't bear it well at all. Do go, now, and bid them make haste, will\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nLater, when the leg was better, the poor boy's mental misery once\r\noverpowered him, even in his mother's presence. Sitting with her and\r\nhis sister--\"... He said, 'He did not know how he should bear his\r\nmisfortune. When he thought of the long, long days, and months, and\r\nyears, to the end of his life, and that he should never run and play,\r\nand never be like other people, and never able to do the commonest\r\nthings without labor and trouble, he wished he was dead. He would\r\nrather have died!' Agnes thought he must be miserable indeed if he\r\nwould venture to say this to his mother.\" Such was the idea that these\r\nchildren had of maternal sympathy and love! So little did they look\r\nupon their mother as the one person above all others to whom their\r\nsecret troubles should be opened!\r\n\r\nIt is proper to observe that the mother came out of this test well.\r\nThere is no record that Mrs. Martineau was ever found wanting in due\r\ncare for her children when the pent-up agony of their bodies or spirits\r\nbecame so violent as to burst the bonds of reserve that her general\r\ndemeanor and method of management imposed upon them. Her children's\r\nmisery (for Harriet was not the only one of the family whose childhood\r\nwas wretched) came not from any intentional neglect, or even from any\r\nindifference on her part to their comfort and happiness, but solely,\r\nlet it be repeated, from her arbitrary manner and her quickness of\r\ntemper. It is worth repeating (if biography be of value for the lessons\r\nwhich may be drawn from it for the conduct of other lives) that the\r\nmother whose children were so spirit-tossed and desolate was,\r\nnevertheless, one who gave herself up to their interests, and labored\r\nincessantly and unselfishly for their welfare. It was not love that\r\nreally was wanting; far less was it faithfulness in the performance of\r\na mother's material duties to her children; all that was lacking was\r\nthe free play of the emotions on the surface, the kisses, the loving\r\nphrases, the fond tones, which are assuredly neither weaknesses nor\r\nworks of supererogation in family life. By means of candid expression\r\nalone can the emotions of one mind touch those of another; and from the\r\nlack of such contact between a child and its mother there must come, in\r\nso close a life relationship, misery to the younger and disappointment\r\nto the elder of the two.\r\n\r\n\"I really think,\" says Harriet, \"if I had once conceived that anybody\r\ncared for me, nearly all the sins and sorrows of my anxious childhood\r\nwould have been spared me.\" Yet, not only was she well fed, well\r\nclothed, well educated, and sent to amusements to give her pleasure\r\n(magic lanterns, parties and seaside trips are all mentioned); but\r\nbesides all this, when she did burst forth, like Hugh Proctor in the\r\nbook, with the expression of her suffering, she was soothed and cared\r\nfor. But this last happened so rarely--of course entirely because it\r\nwas made so difficult for her to express herself--that the occasions\r\nlived in her memory all her life.\r\n\r\nThe moral consequences of all this were naturally bad. Even with all\r\nmotherly sympathy and encouragement, so sickly a child would have been\r\nlikely to suffer from timidity, and to fall into occasional fits of\r\ndespondency and irritability; but, with fear continually excited in\r\nher mind, and with an eternal storm of passionate opposition to\r\narbitrary authority raging in her soul, it is no wonder that the poor\r\nchild made for herself a character for willfulness and obstinacy,\r\nwhile internally she suffered dreadfully from her conscience. \"In my\r\nchildhood,\" she says, \"I would assert or deny anything to my mother\r\nthat would bring me through most easily.... This was so exclusively\r\nto one person that, though there was remonstrance and punishment, I\r\nwas never regarded as a liar in the family.\" Her strength of will\r\nwas very great; and when she had been placed in a false position by\r\nher dread of rebuke, the powerful will came into play to maintain\r\na dogged, stubborn, indifferent appearance. Yet all the while her\r\nconscientiousness--the strong convictions as to what was right, and\r\nthe ardent desire to do it, which marked her whole career--was at work\r\nwithin her, causing a mental shame and distress which might have been\r\neasily aided by gentle treatment to overcome the fear and the firmness\r\nwhich were acting together to make her miserable and a sinner.\r\n\r\nIt is altogether a sad story, but I have not told it at length without\r\nreason. The fact that other children are suffering similarly every day\r\nmakes the record worth repeating. But, besides this, her vivid\r\nremembrance of her childish pangs tends to show how warm and strong\r\nwere her natural affections. If Harriet Martineau's mind had not been\r\nsensitive and emotional, and if her love for those united to her by\r\nfamily ties had not been ardent, she would not have felt as she did in\r\nher childhood, and she would not have remembered, all through her life,\r\nhow she had suffered in her early years from unsatisfied affection.\r\nNow, this soft, loving, emotional side of her character must be\r\nrecognized before her life and her work can be properly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual influences of her home life were not more happy than\r\nthe moral ones. She was thought by her family anything but a clever\r\nchild. Indeed, Dr. James Martineau (whose recollections are peculiarly\r\nvaluable, both from his nearness to Harriet in age and from their great\r\nattachment in early life) still thinks that she really was a dull\r\nchild. Her intelligence, he believes, awoke only in her later youth,\r\ncoincidentally with some improvement in health. It is hard to guess\r\nwhat the impression of her childish intellectual powers might have been\r\nunder different conditions. She suggestively remarks[1]: \"It should\r\nnever be forgotten that the happier a child is the cleverer he will be.\r\nThis is not only because in a state of happiness the mind is free, and\r\nat liberty for the exercise of its faculties instead of spending its\r\nthoughts and energy in brooding over troubles, but also because the\r\naction of the brain is stronger when the frame is in a state of\r\nhilarity; the ideas are more clear, impressions of outward objects are\r\nmore vivid, and the memory will not let them slip.\" Moreover, it is a\r\nfact worthy of note that the recognition by her family of her mental\r\ndevelopment followed upon her return home after she had been away for a\r\ntime, and had been learning at a boarding-school under \"the first\r\nperson of whom she never felt afraid.\" Still, the fact remains that\r\nHarriet was the ugly duckling of her family, and supposed to be the\r\nmost stupid of the group of Martineau children.\r\n\r\n          [1] _Household Education_, p. 202.\r\n\r\nShe was active-minded enough, however, to begin early that spontaneous\r\nself-education which only intellects of real power undertake, either\r\nin childhood or in later years.\r\n\r\nMilton was her master. When she was seven years old she came by\r\naccident upon a copy of _Paradise Lost_ lying open upon a table. Taking\r\nit up, she saw the heading \"Argument,\" and in the text her eye caught\r\nthe word \"Satan.\" Instantly the mind which her relations thought so\r\nsluggish was fired by the desire to know how Satan could be argued\r\nabout. She sought the passage which tells how the arch-fiend was--\r\n\r\n    Hurled headlong flaming from the ethereal sky,\r\n    With hideous ruin and combustion, down\r\n    To bottomless perdition, there to dwell\r\n    In adamantine chains and penal fire.\r\n\r\nFor the ensuing seven years her thoughts dwelt daily in the midst of\r\nthe solemn scenes, and moved to the sound of the sonorous music of\r\nMilton's poetry. \"I wonder how much of it I knew by heart--enough to\r\nbe always repeating it to myself with every change of light and\r\ndarkness, and sound, and silence, the moods of the day and the seasons\r\nof the year.\" The dull child, who neglected her multiplication table,\r\ndid so because her mind was pre-occupied with thoughts of this grander\r\norder.\r\n\r\nHer love of books increased, and her range of reading became wide.\r\nMilton, although the favorite, was by no means her only beloved\r\nauthor. She read rapidly, and, as clever children often do,\r\nvoraciously. Whole pages or scenes from Shakespeare, Goldsmith,\r\nThompson, and Milton she learned by heart, until she knew enough\r\npoetry to have fitted her for the occupation of a wandering reciter.\r\nIn this way her self-education in the English classics, and in\r\nliterary style, went on at the same time with her daily education by\r\nliving teachers.\r\n\r\nHarriet's formal education was somewhat desultory; but it is a\r\nnoteworthy fact that it was, so far as it went, what would have been\r\ncalled a \"boy's education.\" In this respect the history of her mental\r\ndevelopment is the same as that of many other illustrious women of\r\nthe past. Girls' High Schools, and University examinations for\r\nyoung women, are products of the present day, and are rapidly\r\nrendering obsolete the old ideas about the necessary differences and\r\ndistinctions between the education of boys and girls. But up to the\r\nfirst quarter of this century, the minds of boys and of girls were\r\ncommonly submitted to entirely different courses of training. While\r\nthe boys learned precision in reasoning from mathematics, the girls\r\nwere considered sufficiently equipped for their lot in life by a\r\nknowledge of the first three rules of arithmetic. While any faculty of\r\nlanguage that a lad possessed was trained and exercised by the study\r\nof the classics, his sister was thought to require no more teaching in\r\ncomposition and grammar than would enable her to write a letter.\r\nElaborate samplers, specimens of fine stitching, of hemming done by a\r\nthread on the most delicate cambric, of marking in tiny stitches and\r\nwonderful designs, and of lace more noticeable for difficulty in the\r\ndoing than for beauty, have come down to us from our grandmothers'\r\ndays, to show us how the school-time of the girls was being disposed\r\nof, while the boys were studying Euclid, Virgil, and Homer. If we have\r\nchanged all that, and are now beginning to give a considerable\r\nproportion of our girls the same mental diet for the growth and\r\nsustenance of their minds with that which is supplied to boys, it is\r\nlargely owing to the direct efforts in favor of such a course put\r\nforth by women such as Harriet Martineau, who had themselves been, at\r\nleast partially, educated \"like boys,\" and were conscious that to such\r\neducation they owed much of their mental superiority over average\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nIn her earlier years Harriet was taught at home by her elder brothers\r\nand sisters, with the addition of lessons in some subjects from\r\nmasters. She was well grounded in this manner in Latin, French and the\r\nordinary elementary subjects. But her systematic education did not\r\nbegin until she was eleven, when she and her sister Rachel were sent\r\nto a school kept by a good master, at which boys also were receiving\r\ntheir education.\r\n\r\nThe school-life was delectable to Harriet. Mr. Perry, the master, was\r\ngentle in his manner, and methodical in his style of teaching; and\r\nunder his tuition the shy, nervous child felt for the first time\r\nencouraged to do her best, and aided not merely to learn her lessons,\r\nbut also to expand her mental faculties. The two years that she\r\nremained at Mr. Perry's school gave her a fair insight into Latin and\r\nFrench, and enabled her to discover that arithmetic was to her mind a\r\ndelightful pastime rather than a difficult study. English composition\r\nwas formally and carefully taught. This was Harriet's favorite lesson;\r\nbut she would spend her playtime in covering a slate with sums for the\r\nmere pleasure of the exercise.\r\n\r\nWhen Harriet had been at this school for about two years, Mr. Perry\r\nleft Norwich. The home system of education was then resumed. She had\r\nvisiting masters in Latin, French, and music. For the rest, Mrs.\r\nMartineau selected a course of reading on history, biography, and\r\nliterature. One of the girls read aloud daily while the others did\r\nneedle-work.\r\n\r\n\"The amount of time we spent in sewing now appears frightful; but it\r\nwas the way in those days among people like ourselves.\" Harriet became\r\na thoroughly accomplished needle-woman. She had, indeed, a liking for\r\nthe occupation, and continued to do much of it all through her life.\r\nMany of her friends can show handsome pieces of fancy-work done by her\r\nhands. Again and again she contributed to public objects by sending a\r\npiece of her own beautiful needle-work to be sold for the benefit of a\r\nsociety's funds. Not even in the busiest time of her literary life did\r\nshe ever entirely cease to exercise her skill in this feminine\r\noccupation. In fact, she made wool-work her artistic recreation.\r\n\r\nBut with all her liking for needle-work, and with all the use that she\r\nmade of her skill in the art, she did feel very keenly how much her\r\ntime and strength had been wasted in childhood upon the practice of\r\nthis mechanical occupation that should have been employed in the\r\ncultivation of her mental powers. A girl then was required to become a\r\nproficient in the making of every kind of garment. It was considered a\r\ngood test of her capacity to know at an early age how to cut out and\r\nput together a shirt for her father; drawing threads to cut it by, and\r\ndrawing threads to do the rows of fine stitching by, and stitching\r\nevenly and regularly, only two threads of the finest material being\r\ntaken for each stitch! The expenditure of time out of a girl's life,\r\ninvolved in making her capable of doing all this, was something\r\nshocking. In these days, when the development of the means of\r\ncommunication has made division of labor more generally practicable\r\nthan of old, and when nearly all men and women, from the richest to\r\nthe artizan classes, wear garments made chiefly by machinery, I doubt\r\nif many readers can be got to realize how much a girl's intellectual\r\ntraining was diminished when Harriet Martineau was a child by the vast\r\namount of time consumed in training her as a seamstress. Harriet was\r\ntaught how to make all her own clothes, even to covering shoes with\r\nsilk for dancing, and to plaiting straw bonnets. It is as though every\r\nboy were taught in his school-life to be a thorough carpenter, so as\r\nto be able, in youth, to turn out, unaided, any article of furniture.\r\nIt is obvious how much time such technical training must swallow up.\r\nTo conceive how a girl was held back by it, we must ask ourselves:\r\nWhat was her brother doing while she was learning needle-work?\r\n\r\nThe matter did not end with the waste of time alone. Health, strength\r\nand nerve-force--in a word, _power_--was squandered upon it to a\r\ndegree truly lamentable. Harriet Martineau's testimony[2] upon this\r\npoint may be taken, because of her real fondness for the employment\r\nand the skill which she displayed in it:\r\n\r\n          [2] _Household Education_, p. 286.\r\n\r\n    \"I believe it is now generally agreed among those who know best\r\n    that the practice of sewing has been carried much too far for\r\n    health, even in houses where there is no poverty or pressure of\r\n    any kind. No one can well be more fond of sewing than I am, and\r\n    few, except professional seamstresses, have done more of it, and\r\n    my testimony is that it is a most hurtful occupation, except where\r\n    great moderation is observed. I think it is not so much the\r\n    sitting and stooping posture as the incessant monotonous action\r\n    and position of the arms that causes such wear and tear. Whatever\r\n    it may be, there is something in prolonged sewing which is\r\n    remarkably exhausting to the strength, and irritating beyond\r\n    endurance to the nerves. The censorious gossip, during sewing,\r\n    which was the bane of our youth,\" she adds, \"wasted more of our\r\n    precious youthful powers and dispositions than any repentance and\r\n    amendment in after life could repair.\"\r\n\r\nHarriet's reading for pleasure in childhood had mostly to be done by\r\nsnatches. She learned much poetry by keeping the book under her work,\r\non her lap, and glancing at a line now and another then. Shakespeare\r\nshe first enjoyed, while a child, by stealing away from table in the\r\nevenings of one winter, and reading by the light of the drawing-room\r\nfire, while the rest lingered over dessert in the dining-room. In this\r\nway, too, she had to read the newspaper.\r\n\r\nThe older she grew, the less time was afforded her from domestic\r\nduties for study. She was sent, at the age of fourteen, to a\r\nboarding-school near Bristol, kept by an aunt of her own, where she\r\nstayed fifteen months, and on her return home her education was\r\nconsidered finished. Thenceforth it was a struggle to obtain\r\npermission to spend any time in reading or writing, and such\r\nopportunities as she got, or could make, had to be taken advantage of\r\nin secrecy.\r\n\r\nIt is melancholy to read of her \"spending a frightful amount of time\r\nin sewing,\" and being \"expected always to sit down in the parlor to\r\nsew,\" instead of studying; of her being \"at the work-table regularly\r\nafter breakfast, making my own clothes or the shirts of the household,\r\nor about some fancy work, or if ever I shut myself into my own room\r\nfor an hour of solitude, I knew it was at the risk of being sent for\r\nto join the sewing-circle;\" and of the necessity that she lay under to\r\nfind time for study by stealing secret hours from sleep. But it is\r\nneedful to lay stress upon these hindrances through which the growing\r\ngirl fought her way to mental development. Wide though her knowledge\r\nwas, great though her mental powers became, who can tell how much was\r\ntaken from her possibilities (as from those of all other great women\r\nof the past) by such waste of her powers in childhood and youth?\r\n\r\nIt is distressing to think about. The only comfort is that it was\r\ninevitable. Of all the causes that unite to make the women of the\r\npresent more favorably circumstanced than those of the past, none is\r\nmore potent than the progress of mechanical discovery having relieved\r\nthem from the necessity of making all the clothing of mankind with\r\ntheir own hands. From the era when Errina, the Greek poetess,\r\nmournfully lamented that her mother tied her to her distaff, down to\r\nthe days in which Harriet Martineau studied by snatches, and spent her\r\ndays in making shirts in the parlor, an enormous amount of feminine\r\npower has been squandered wastefully in this direction. If women\r\nhereafter draw out a Comtist calendar of days upon which to reverence\r\nthe memory of those who have helped them on in the scale of beings,\r\nassuredly they must find places for the inventors of the\r\nspinning-mule, the stocking-loom and the sewing-machine.\r\n\r\nReligion formed the chief source of happiness to Harriet Martineau in\r\nchildhood and early youth. Her parents were Unitarians, and their\r\nchild's theology was, therefore, of a mild type, lacking a hell, a\r\npersonal devil, a theory of original sin, and the like. She did not\r\nfear God, while she feared almost all human beings, and her devotion\r\nwas thus a source of great joy and little misery.\r\n\r\nWhen she was at the Bristol boarding-school, she came under the\r\nministerial influence of the great Unitarian preacher, the Rev. Dr.\r\nCarpenter. The power of his teaching increased the ardor of her\r\nreligious sentiments. She was just at an intense age--between\r\nfourteen and sixteen. Dr. Carpenter's religious instructions made\r\nthe theism in which she had been educated become a firm personal\r\nconviction, and caused the natural action of a sensitive conscience,\r\nthe self-devotion and humility of a deep power of veneration, and\r\nthe truthfulness and sincerity of a rare courage, to be blended\r\nindistinguishably in their exercise with emotional outpourings of the\r\nspirit in worship, and with attachment to certain theological tenets.\r\n\r\nHer younger sister well remembers that Harriet's fervent and\r\nsomewhat gloomy piety was the cause of a good deal of quizzing\r\namongst her elders, when she returned home from Bristol; their\r\namusement being mixed, however, with much respect for her sincerity\r\nand conscientiousness. But, as her mind expanded, she thought as\r\nwell as felt about her theology, and her religious development did\r\nnot end with childhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEARLY WOMANHOOD: DEVELOPING INFLUENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Norwich, in the early years of this century, was a somewhat\r\nexceptional place. It so chanced that besides the exclusiveness\r\nnatural even now to the society of a cathedral town--besides the\r\ninsular tone of thought and manners which most towns possessed in\r\nthose pre-railway days, and while our continental wars were holding\r\nour country-people isolated from foreign nations--besides all this,\r\nNorwich then prided herself upon having produced a good deal of\r\nliterary ability. Her William Taylor was considered to be almost the\r\nonly German scholar in England, and other men, whose names are now\r\nnearly forgotten, but who in their day were looked up to as lights of\r\nlearning and literature--Sayers, Smith, Enfield, Alderson, and\r\nothers,--gave a tone to the society of Norwich, which, if somewhat\r\npedantic, was, nevertheless, favorable to the intellectual life. It is\r\nno small testimony to the healthy and stimulating mental atmosphere of\r\nold Norwich that there successively came out from her, in an age when\r\nindividuality and intellect in woman were steadily repressed, three\r\nwomen of such mark as Amelia Opie, Elizabeth Fry and Harriet\r\nMartineau.\r\n\r\nBut even in Norwich the repression just alluded to was felt by women.\r\nEven there it was held, to say the least, peculiar and undesirable for\r\na girl to wish to study deep subjects. \"When I was young,\" Miss\r\nMartineau writes, \"it was not thought proper for young ladies to study\r\nvery conspicuously; and especially with pen in hand.\" They were\r\nrequired to be always ready \"to receive callers, without any sign of\r\nblue-stockingism which could be reported abroad. My first studies in\r\nphilosophy were carried on with great care and reserve.... I won time\r\nfor what my heart was set upon either in the early morning or late at\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\nIt was thus at unseasonable hours, and without the encouraging support\r\nof that public feeling of the value and desirability of knowledge, and\r\nthe honorableness of its acquisition, by which a young man's studies\r\nare unconsciously aided, that Harriet in her young womanhood continued\r\nto learn. She read Latin with her brother James, and translated from\r\nthe classics by herself. Her cousin, Mr. Lee, read Italian with her\r\nand her sister; and in course of time they undertook the translation\r\nof Petrarch's sonnets into English verse. She read Blair's Rhetoric\r\nrepeatedly. Her Biblical studies were continued until she was in that\r\nposition which, according to Macaulay, is necessary \"for a critic of\r\nthe niceties of the English language;\" she had \"the Bible at her\r\nfingers' ends.\"\r\n\r\nBut her solitary studies went also into heavier and less frequented\r\npaths. Dr. Carpenter had taught her to interest herself in mental and\r\nmoral philosophy. She read about these subjects at first because he\r\nhad written upon them, and afterwards because she found them really\r\ncongenial to her mind. Locke and Hartley were the authors whom she\r\nstudied most closely. Then the works of Priestley, and the study of\r\nhis life and opinions--which she naturally undertook, because Dr.\r\nPriestley was the great apostle and martyr of Unitarianism--led her to\r\nmake a very full acquaintance with the metaphysicians of the Scotch\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nTo how much purpose she thus read the best books then available, upon\r\nsome of the highest topics that can engage the attention, soon became\r\napparent when she began to write; but of this I must speak in due\r\ncourse later on. Two other of the most important events, or rather\r\ntrains of events, in the history of her young womanhood, must be\r\nmentioned first.\r\n\r\nThe earlier of these was the gradual oncoming and increase of her\r\ndeafness. She began to be slightly deaf while she was at Mr. Perry's\r\nschool, and the fact was there recognized so far as to cause her to be\r\nplaced next to her teacher in the class. How keenly she even then felt\r\nthis loss, she has in part revealed in the story of Hugh Procter; and\r\na few lines from an essay of hers on Scott may here be added:\r\n\r\n\"Few have any idea of the all-powerful influence which the sense of\r\npersonal infirmity exerts over the mind of a child. If it were known,\r\nits apparent disproportionateness to other influences would, to the\r\ncareless observer, appear absurd; to the thoughtful it would afford\r\nnew lights respecting the conduct of educational discipline; it would\r\nalso pierce the heart of many a parent who now believes that he knows\r\nall, and who feels so tender a regret for what he knows that even the\r\nsufferer wonders at its extent. But this is a species of suffering\r\nwhich can never obtain sufficient sympathy, because the sufferer\r\nhimself is not aware, till he has made comparison of this with other\r\npains, how light all others are in comparison.\"\r\n\r\nAs pathetically, but more briefly, she says about herself:--\"My\r\ndeafness, when new, was the uppermost thing in my mind day and night.\"\r\n\r\nHer inability to hear continued to increase by slow degrees during the\r\nnext six years; and when she was eighteen \"a sort of accident\"\r\nsuddenly increased it. Music had, until then, been one of her great\r\ndelights, and it shows how gradual was the progress of her deafness,\r\nthat she found herself able to hear at an orchestral concert, provided\r\nshe could get a seat with a back against which she could press her\r\nshoulder-blades, for a long time after the music had become inaudible\r\nwithout this assistance. Such a gradual deprivation of a most\r\nimportant sense is surely far more trying than a quick, unexpected,\r\nand obviously irremediable loss would be. The alternations of hope and\r\ndespair, the difficulty of inducing the sufferer's friends to\r\nrecognize how serious the case is, the perhaps yet greater difficulty\r\nto the patient to resolutely step out of the ranks of ordinary people\r\nand take up the position of one deficient in a sense, the\r\nmortifications which have to be endured again and again both from the\r\nignorance of strangers and the mistaken sympathy of friends--all these\r\nmake up the special trial of one who becomes by degrees the subject of\r\na chronic affliction. No sensitive person can possibly pass through\r\nthis fiery trial unchanged. Such an experience must either refine or\r\nharden; must either strengthen the powers of endurance or break down\r\nthe mind to querulous ill-temper; must either make self the centre of\r\ncreation or greatly add to the power of putting personal interests\r\naside for the sake of wider and more unselfish thoughts and feelings.\r\nWhich class of influences Harriet Martineau accepted from her trial\r\nthe history of her courageous, resolute life-work, and her devotion to\r\ntruth and duty as she saw them, will sufficiently show.\r\n\r\nHow much she suffered in mind was quite unknown to her family at the\r\ntime. She was always reserved in speaking about her own feelings and\r\nemotions to her mother, and in this particular case Mrs. Martineau,\r\nwith the kindest intentions, discouraged, as far as possible, all\r\nrecognition of the growing infirmity. The society of Norwich had never\r\nbeen very attractive to the young girl, who was above the average in\r\nnatural abilities, and still further removed from the petty and\r\nfrivolous gossip of the commonplace evening party, by the extensive\r\nand elevating course of study through which her mind had passed. Had\r\nshe been well able to hear, she could have quietly accepted what such\r\nintercourse could give her. This would have been much. Kindliness and\r\ngood feeling, common sense, and ideas about man and his circumstances,\r\nare to be enjoyed and gained quite as much in ordinary as in what is\r\ncommonly called intellectual society. But in the freshness of her\r\nsensitive suffering Harriet shrank from the Norwich evening parties.\r\nHer mother, however, insisted upon her taking her full share of\r\nvisiting.\r\n\r\nThe case was made worse by the customary errors in the treatment of\r\ndeaf persons; namely, the endeavoring to keep up the illusion that she\r\nwas not deaf, the occasional assurances that she could hear as well as\r\never if it were not for her habits of abstraction, and so forth, and\r\nthe imploring her to always ask when she did not hear what was said,\r\nfollowed by scoldings (kindly meant, but none the less irritating to\r\nthe object) when it was found that she had been silently losing the\r\nlarger part of a conversation. False pride, pretence, and selfish\r\nexactions were thus sought to be nourished in her; while the blessings\r\nof an open recognition of her trouble, and a full and free sympathy\r\nwith her pain and her difficulty in learning to bear it, were at the\r\nsame time withheld.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of this method of treatment of such a case as erroneous.\r\nBut in such a matter only those who have gone through the experience\r\nand have come out of it at last, as she did, with the moral nature\r\nstrengthened, and the power of self-management increased, can be really\r\ncompetent to express an opinion upon the proper method of behavior to\r\nsimilar sufferers. I hasten to add, therefore, that in substance the\r\nview that I have given is that expressed in Harriet Martineau's _Letter\r\nto the Deaf_, published in 1834. In that remarkable fragment of\r\nautobiography she appealed to the large number of people who suffered\r\nlike herself, to insist upon the frank recognition of their infirmity,\r\nand to themselves acquiesce with patience in all the deprivations and\r\nmortifications which the loss of a sense must bring. The revelation in\r\nthis essay of her own sufferings is most touching; and very noble and\r\nbeautiful is the way in which she urges that the misery must be met,\r\nand the humiliation must be turned aside, by no other means than\r\ncourage, candor, patience, and an unselfish determination to consider\r\nfirst the convenience and happiness of others instead of the sufferer's\r\nown.\r\n\r\n    \"Instead of putting the singularity out of sight we should\r\n    acknowledge it in words, prepare for it in habits, and act upon it\r\n    in social intercourse. Thus only can we save others from being\r\n    uneasy in our presence, and sad when they think of us. That we can\r\n    thus alone make ourselves sought and beloved is an inferior\r\n    consideration, though an important one to us, to whom warmth and\r\n    kindness are as peculiarly animating as sunshine to the caged\r\n    bird. This frankness, simplicity, and cheerfulness can only grow\r\n    out of a perfect acquiescence in our circumstances. Submission is\r\n    not enough. Pride fails at the most critical moment. But hearty\r\n    acquiescence cannot fail to bring forth cheerfulness. The thrill\r\n    of delight which arises during the ready agreement to profit by\r\n    pain (emphatically the joy with which no stranger intermeddleth)\r\n    must subside like all other emotions; but it does not depart\r\n    without leaving the spirit lightened and cheered; and every\r\n    visitation leaves it in a more genial state than the last.... I\r\n    had infinitely rather bear the perpetual sense of privation than\r\n    become unaware of anything which is true--of my intellectual\r\n    deficiences, of my disqualifications for society, of my errors in\r\n    matter of fact, and of the burdens that I necessarily impose on\r\n    those who surround me. We can never get beyond the necessity of\r\n    keeping in full view the worst and the best that can be made of\r\n    our lot. The worst is either to sink under the trial or to be made\r\n    callous by it. The best is to be as wise as possible under a great\r\n    disability, and as happy as possible under a great privation.\"\r\n\r\nIt is essential, for a correct understanding of her character, that\r\nthis great trial of her youth should be presented amidst the moulding\r\ninfluences of that time with as much strength as it was experienced.\r\nBut it is difficult, within the necessary limits of quotation, to\r\nconvey an idea to the reader of either the intensity and bitterness of\r\nthe suffering revealed, or of the firmness and beauty of the spirit\r\nwith which the trial was met. Nor was the advice that she gave to\r\nothers mere talk, which she herself never put in practice. If her\r\nfamily did not realize at the time how deeply she suffered, still less\r\ncould her friends in later life discover by anything in her manners\r\nthat her soul had been so searched and her spirits so tried. So\r\nfrankly and candidly, and with such an utter absence of affectation,\r\ndid she accept this condition of her life, that those around her\r\nhardly realized that she felt it as a deprivation; and a few lines in\r\nher autobiography, in which she mentions how conscious she was of\r\nintellectual fatigue from the lack of those distractions to the mind\r\nwhich enter continually through the normal ear, came like a painful\r\nshock to her friends, making them feel that they had been unconscious\r\nof a need ever present with her throughout life.\r\n\r\nFor some time after the deafness began, she did not use an\r\near-trumpet. Like many in a similar position, she persuaded herself\r\nthat her deafness was not sufficiently great to cause any considerable\r\ninconvenience to others in conversation. At length, however, she was\r\nenlightened upon this point. An account appeared in a Unitarian paper\r\nof two remarkable cures of deafness by galvanism, and Harriet's\r\nfriends persuaded her to try this new remedy. For a brief while, hope\r\nwas revived in her; the treatment threw her into a state of nervous\r\nfever, during which she regained considerable sensibility in the organ\r\nof hearing. The improvement was very temporary, but it lasted\r\nsufficiently long to let her know how much her friends had been\r\nstraining their throats for her sake. From that time she invariably\r\ncarried and used an ear-trumpet, commencing with an india-rubber tube,\r\nwith a cup at the end for the speaker to take into his hand, but\r\nafterwards employing an ordinary stiff trumpet.\r\n\r\nInto this existence, which had hitherto been so full of sadness, there\r\ncame at length the bright-tinted and vivid shower of light, which\r\nmeans so much to a woman. Love came to brighten the life so dark\r\nhitherto for lack of that sunshine. Much as it is to any woman to know\r\nherself beloved by the man whom she loves, to Harriet Martineau it was\r\neven more than to most. It was not only that her character was a\r\nstrong one, and that to such a nature all influences that are accepted\r\nbecome powerful forces, but besides this she had always loved more\r\nthan she had been loved; and her self-esteem had been systematically\r\nsuppressed by her mother's stern discipline, and afterwards injured by\r\nthe mortifications to which the on-coming of her deafness gave rise.\r\nHow much, in such a case, it must have been, when the hour at last\r\ncame for the history of the heart to be written! How delightful the\r\ntime when she could cherish in her thoughts a love which was at once\r\nan equal friendship and a vivid passion! How great the revolution in\r\nher mind when she found that the man whom she could love would choose\r\nher from all the world of women to be his dearest, the partner of his\r\nlife!\r\n\r\nIt would be a proof, if proof were needed at this time of day, that it\r\nis well-nigh impossible for any person to give a candid, full and\r\nunerring record of his own past, and the circumstances in it which\r\nhave most influenced his development, to turn from the brief and\r\ncursory record which Harriet Martineau's autobiography gives of this\r\nattachment, to the complete story as I have it to tell, here and in a\r\nfuture chapter.\r\n\r\nThe strongest of all the family affections of her childhood and youth\r\nwas that which she felt for her brother James. He was two years\r\nyounger than herself. They had been playmates in childhood, and\r\ncompanions in study later on. Harriet's first attraction to Mr.\r\nWorthington was that he was her brother's friend. The two young men\r\nwere fellow-students at college, preparing for the Unitarian ministry.\r\nWorthington was already well known to Harriet from her brother's\r\nletters before she saw him. He then went on a visit to Norwich, to\r\nspend a part of the vacation with James, and the interest which the\r\nfriend and the sister already felt in each other, from their mutual\r\naffection for the brother, soon ripened into love. This was, I\r\nbelieve, in 1822, when she was twenty years old.\r\n\r\nHer father and mother looked not unkindly upon the dawning of this\r\naffection. The brother, however, who knew the two so well, felt quite\r\ncertain that they were not suited for each other. Harriet was of a\r\nstrong, decided temper, even somewhat arbitrary and hasty, quick in\r\nher judgments, and firm in her opinions. The temperament of\r\nWorthington, on the other hand, was, I am told, gentle, impressionable\r\nand sensitive in the extreme. He was highly conscientious, and\r\nultra-tender in his treatment of the characters and opinions of\r\nothers. The two seemed in many respects the antipodes of each other.\r\nHe who knew them both best was convinced that they would not be happy\r\ntogether, and that opinion he has never changed.\r\n\r\nIt is above all things difficult to predict beforehand whether two\r\napparently antagonistic characters will really clash and jar in the\r\nclose union of married life, or whether, on the contrary, the\r\ndeficiencies of the one will be supplemented by those opposite\r\ntendencies which are rather in excess in the other. It is notorious\r\nthat marriages are seldom perfect matches in the view of outsiders;\r\nthe incongruities in the temperaments and the habits of life and\r\nthought, are more easily discerned than the fusing influence of ardent\r\nlove can be measured. Nor, indeed, can the changes which will be\r\nworked in the disposition by a surrender to the free play of emotion\r\nbe accurately foreseen. Considerations such as these, however, do not\r\nhave much weight in the mind of a young man whose experience of the\r\nmysteries of the human heart is yet to come; and James Martineau was\r\nstrongly averse to the engagement of his sister and his friend. Their\r\nattachment was not then permitted to become an engagement. Worthington\r\nwas poor--was still only a student--Harriet was supposed, at that\r\ntime, to be well portioned; the sensitive temperament of the young\r\nlover felt the variety of discouragements placed in the path of his\r\naffection, and so that affection which should have brought only joy\r\nbecame, in fact, to Harriet the cause of sorrow, suspense and anxiety.\r\nYet its vivifying influence was felt, and the true happiness which is\r\ninseparable from mutual love, however the emotion be checked and\r\ndenied its full expression, was not lacking. For some insight into\r\nwhat Harriet Martineau knew and felt of love, we must look elsewhere\r\nthan in the formal record of the Autobiography.[3] But this, like all\r\nthe other chief events of her life, has found a place in her works\r\nunder a thin veiling of her personality. Let us see from one of her\r\nearly essays how Harriet Martineau learned to regard love. The essay\r\nis called \"In a Hermit's Cave.\"\r\n\r\n          [3] Mr. H. G. Atkinson writes to me: \"She had written much\r\n          more at length (than is published) in her Autobiography about\r\n          her courtship; but she consulted me about publishing it, and\r\n          I advised her not to do so--the matter counted for so little\r\n          in such a life as hers.\" The quotation which I give here\r\n          shows for what it did really count in the history of her\r\n          mental development. But so difficult must it needs be for the\r\n          writer of an autobiography to speak frankly of the more\r\n          sacred experiences of the life, that it is not surprising\r\n          that Harriet Martineau \"destroyed what she had written,\" when\r\n          so advised by the friend whom she consulted. I need only add\r\n          that the many new details about the facts of this matter,\r\n          which I am able to give, I have received from two of her own\r\n          generation, both of whom were very intimate friends of hers\r\n          at the time when all this occurred.\r\n\r\n    \"The place was not ill-chosen by the holy man, if the\r\n    circumstances could but have been adapted to that highest\r\n    worship--the service of the life.... But there is yet wanting the\r\n    altar of the human heart, on which alone a fire is kindled from\r\n    above to shine in the faces of all true worshippers for ever.\r\n    Where this flame, the glow of human love, is burning, there is the\r\n    temple of worship, be it only beside the humblest village hearth:\r\n    where it has not been kindled there is no sanctuary; and the\r\n    loftiest amphitheatre of mountains, lighted up by the ever-burning\r\n    stars, is no more the dwelling-place of Jehovah than the Temple of\r\n    Solomon before it was filled with the glory of the Presence....\r\n\r\n    \"Yes, Love is worship, authorized and approved.... Many are the\r\n    gradations through which this service rises until it has reached\r\n    that on which God has bestowed His most manifest benediction, on\r\n    which Jesus smiled at Cana, but which the devotee presumed to\r\n    decline. Not more express were the ordinances of Sinai than the\r\n    Divine provisions for wedded love; never was it more certain that\r\n    Jehovah benignantly regarded the festivals of His people than it\r\n    is daily that He has appointed those mutual rejoicings of the\r\n    affections, which need but to be referred to Him to become a holy\r\n    homage. Yet there have been many who pronounce common that which\r\n    God has purified, and reject or disdain that which He has\r\n    proffered and blest. How ignorant must such be of the growth of\r\n    that within! How unobservant of what passes without! Would that\r\n    all could know how from the first flow of the affections, until\r\n    they are shed abroad in their plentitude, the purposes of creation\r\n    become fulfilled. Would that all could know how, by this mighty\r\n    impulse, new strength is given to every power; how the intellect\r\n    is vivified and enlarged; how the spirit becomes bold to explore\r\n    the path of life, and clear-sighted to discern its issues.... For\r\n    that piety which has humanity for its object--must not that heart\r\n    feel most of which tenderness has become the element? Must not the\r\n    spirit which is most exercised in hope and fear be most familiar\r\n    with hope and fear wherever found?\r\n\r\n    \"How distinctly I saw all this in those who are now sanctifying\r\n    their first Sabbath of wedded love.... The one was at peace with\r\n    all that world which had appeared so long at war with him. He\r\n    feared nothing, he possessed all; and of the overflowings of his\r\n    love he could spare to every living thing. The other thought of no\r\n    world but the bright one above, and the quiet one before her, in\r\n    each of which dwelt one in whom she had perfect trust.... In her\r\n    the progression has been so regular, and the work so perfect, that\r\n    any return to the former perturbations of her spirit seems\r\n    impossible. She entered upon a new life when her love began; and\r\n    it is as easy to conceive that there is one Life Giver to the\r\n    body, and another to the spirit, as that this progression is not\r\n    the highest work of God on earth, and its results abounding to His\r\n    praise.... To those who know them as I know them, they appear\r\n    already possessed of an experience in comparison with which it\r\n    would appear little to have looked abroad from the Andes, or\r\n    explored the treasure-caves of the deep, or to have conversed with\r\n    every nation under the sun. If they could see all that the eyes of\r\n    the firmament look upon, and hear all the whispered secrets that\r\n    the roving winds bear in their bosoms, they could learn but little\r\n    new; for the deepest mysteries are those of human love, and the\r\n    vastest knowledge is that of the human heart.\"\r\n\r\nEven more vividly, at a later period, she told something of her\r\nexperiences in one of her fictions, under the guise of a conversation\r\nbetween a young husband and wife:--\r\n\r\n    \"Do you really think there are any people that have passed through\r\n    life without knowing what that moment was, that stir in one's\r\n    heart on being first sure that one is beloved? It is most like the\r\n    soul getting free of the body and rushing into Paradise, I should\r\n    think. Do you suppose anybody ever lived a life without having\r\n    felt this?\"\r\n\r\n    Walter feared it might be so; but, if so, a man missed the moment\r\n    that made a man of one that was but an unthinking creature before;\r\n    and a woman the moment best worth living for....\r\n\r\n    \"It seems to me,\" said Effie, \"that though God has kindly given\r\n    this token of blessedness to all--or to so many that we may nearly\r\n    say all--without distinction of great or humble, rich or poor, the\r\n    great and the lowly use themselves to the opposite faults. The\r\n    great do not seem to think it the most natural thing to marry\r\n    where they first love; and the lowly are too ready to love.\"\r\n\r\n    \"That is because the great have too many things to look to besides\r\n    love; and the lowly have too few. The rich have their lighted\r\n    palaces to bask in, as well as the sunshine; and they must have a\r\n    host of admirers, as well as one bosom friend. And when the poor\r\n    man finds that there is one bliss that no power on earth can shut\r\n    him out from, and one that drives out all evils for the time--one\r\n    that makes him forget the noon-day heats, and one that tempers the\r\n    keen north wind, and makes him walk at his full height when his\r\n    superiors lounge past him in the street--no wonder he is eager to\r\n    meet it, and jogs the time-glass to make it come at the soonest.\r\n    If such a man is imprudent, I had rather be he than one that first\r\n    lets it slip through cowardice, and would then bring it back to\r\n    gratify his low ambition!\"\r\n\r\n    \"And for those who let it go by for conscience sake, and do not\r\n    ask for it again?\"\r\n\r\n    \"Why, they are happy in having learned what _the one feeling is\r\n    that life is worth living for_. They may make themselves happy upon\r\n    it for ever, after that. Oh! Effie, you would not believe, nothing\r\n    could make you believe, what I was the day before and the day after\r\n    I saw that sudden change of look of yours that told me all. The one\r\n    day, I was shrinking inwardly from everything I had to do, and\r\n    every word of my father's, and everybody I met; and was always\r\n    trying to make myself happy in myself alone, with the sense of God\r\n    being near me and with me. The other day, I looked down upon\r\n    everybody, in a kindly way; and yet I looked up to them, too, for I\r\n    felt a respect that I never knew before for all that were suffering\r\n    and enjoying; and I felt as if I could have brought the whole world\r\n    nearer to God, if they would have listened to me. I shall never\r\n    forget the best moment of all--when my mind had suddenly ceased\r\n    being in a great tumult, which had as much pain as pleasure in it.\r\n    When I said distinctly to myself, 'She loves me,' Heaven came down\r\n    round about me that minute.\"[4]\r\n\r\n          [4] _Illustrations of Political Economy_: \"A Tale of the\r\n          Tyne,\" pp. 54, _et seq._ This passage is doubly interesting\r\n          from the fact that Mr. Malthus, the discoverer of the\r\n          Population Law, sent specially to thank her for having\r\n          written it.\r\n\r\nThis tells how Harriet Martineau could love in her youth. Perhaps the\r\nstream ran all the more powerfully for its course being checked; for\r\nit was over three years after she met and became attached to Mr.\r\nWorthington before their love was allowed to be declared, and their\r\nengagement was permitted--a long period for hope and fear to do their\r\npainful office in the soul, a long test of the reality of the love on\r\nboth sides.\r\n\r\nHer extensive and deep studies, her sufferings and inward strivings\r\nfrom her deafness, and the joys and anxieties of her love, were the\r\nchief moulding influences of her early womanhood. We shall soon see\r\nhow she came to seek expression for the results of all these in\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nEARLIEST WRITINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHarriet Martineau's first attempt to write for publication was made in\r\nthe same year that her acquaintance with Mr. Worthington was formed; in\r\n1822, when she was twenty years old. It was, apparently, at the close\r\nof the vacation in which Worthington had visited his friend Martineau\r\nat Norwich, that she commenced a paper with the design of offering it\r\nto the Unitarian magazine, _The Monthly Repository_. She had told James\r\nthat when he had returned to college she should be miserable, and he\r\nhad, with equal kindness and sense, advised her to try to forget her\r\nfeelings about the parting by an attempt at authorship. On a bright\r\nSeptember morning, therefore, when she had seen him start by the early\r\ncoach, soon after six, she sat down in her own room with a supply of\r\nfoolscap paper before her to write her first article.\r\n\r\nThe account which she--writing from memory--gives in her autobiography,\r\nof this little transaction, is curiously inaccurate, as far as the\r\ntrifling details are concerned. Her own statement is that she took\r\nthe letter \"V\" for her signature, and that she found her paper\r\nprinted in the next number of the magazine, \"and in the 'Notices to\r\nCorrespondents' a request to hear more from 'V' of Norwich.\" Her little\r\nerrors about these facts must be corrected, because the truth of the\r\nmatter is at once suggestive and amusing.\r\n\r\nThe article may be found in the _Monthly Repository_ for October, 1822.\r\nIt is signed, not \"V,\" but \"Discipulus.\" This, it need hardly be\r\npointed out, is the _masculine_ form of the Latin for learner, or\r\napprentice. The note in the correspondents' column is not in that same\r\nmonth's magazine; but in the number for the succeeding month, the\r\neditor says in his answers to correspondents: \"The continuation of\r\n'Discipulus' has come to hand. _His_ other proposed communications will\r\nprobably be acceptable.\" If more proofs than these were required that\r\nthe youthful authoress had presented herself to her editor in a manly\r\ndisguise, it would be furnished by a passage in one of these\r\n\"Discipulus\" articles, in which she definitely figures herself as a\r\nmasculine writer, speaking of \"our sex\" (_i.e._ the male sex) as a man\r\nwould do. The interesting fact is thus disclosed that Harriet Martineau\r\nadds another to the group of the most eminent women writers of this\r\ncentury who thought it necessary to assume the masculine sex in order\r\nto obtain a fair hearing and an impartial judgment for their earliest\r\nwork. Surely, as our \"Discipulus\" takes her place in this list with\r\nGeorge Eliot, George Sand, and Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell, a great\r\ndeal is disclosed to us about how women in the past have had to make\r\ntheir way to recognition _against the tide_ of public opinion.\r\n\r\nThat first printed essay is interesting because it was the precursor\r\nof so long a course of literary work, rather than for itself. Yet it\r\nis not without its own interest, and is very far indeed from being the\r\ncrude, imperfect performance of the ordinary amateur. The subject is\r\n\"Female Writers of Practical Divinity.\" Here are the first words that\r\nHarriet Martineau uttered through the press:\r\n\r\n\"I do not know whether it has been remarked by others as well as\r\nmyself, that some of the finest and most useful English works on the\r\nsubject of practical Divinity are by female authors. I suppose it is\r\nowing to the peculiar susceptibility of the female mind, and its\r\nconsequent warmth of feeling, that its productions, when they are\r\nreally valuable, find a more ready way to the heart than those of the\r\nother sex; and it gives me great pleasure to see women gifted with\r\nsuperior talents applying those talents to promote the cause of\r\nreligion and virtue.\"\r\n\r\nThere is nothing remarkable in the literary form of this first\r\narticle. How soon she came to have a style of her own, vivid,\r\nstirring, and instinct with a powerful individuality, may have been\r\ngathered already from the quotations given in our last chapter. But in\r\nher first paper the style is coldly correct; imitative of good but\r\nsevere models, and displaying none of the writer's individuality. Two\r\npoints as regards the matter of the essay are of special interest, and\r\nthoroughly characteristic. It is interesting, in the first place, to\r\nknow that she who was destined to do probably more than any other one\r\nwoman of her century for the enlargement of the sphere of her sex in\r\nthe field of letters, should have written her first article on the\r\nsubject of the capacity of women to teach through their writings. The\r\nsecond point worth noticing is that her idea of \"practical Divinity\"\r\nis simply, good conduct. Theological disputation and dogma do not\r\ndisturb her pages. Her view of practical Divinity is that it teaches\r\nmorals; and it is largely because the women to whose writings she\r\ndraws attention have occupied themselves with the attempt to trace out\r\nrules of conduct, that she is interested in their writings, and\r\nrejoices in their labors. Indeed, she only alludes once to the\r\nopinions on dogmatic theology of the writers whom she quotes, and then\r\nshe does it only to put aside with scorn the idea that morality and\r\nteaching should be rejected because of differences upon points of\r\ntheology.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the few stately words with which the editor of the\r\n_Repository_ had received the offer of more contributions, \"Discipulus\"\r\ncontinued his literary labors, and the result appeared in a paper on\r\n\"Female Education,\" published in the _Monthly Repository_ of February,\r\n1823. This is a noble and powerful appeal for the higher education of\r\ngirls and the full development of all the powers of our sex. It is\r\nwritten with gentleness and tact, but it courageously asserts and\r\ndemands much that was strange indeed to the tone of that day, though it\r\nhas become quite commonplace in ours.\r\n\r\nThe author (supposed to be a man, be it remembered,) disclaimed any\r\nintention of proving that the minds of women were equal to those of\r\nmen, but only desired to show that what little powers the female\r\nintellect might possess should be fully cultivated. Nevertheless, the\r\nfact was pointed out that women had seldom had a chance of showing how\r\nnear they might be able to equal men intellectually, for while the lad\r\nwas at the higher school and college, preparing his mind for a future,\r\n\"the girl is probably confined to low pursuits, her aspirings after\r\nknowledge are subdued, she is taught to believe that solid information\r\nis unbecoming her sex; almost her whole time is expended on low\r\naccomplishments, and thus, before she is sensible of her powers, they\r\nare checked in their growth and chained down to mean objects, to rise\r\nno more; and when the natural consequences of this mode of treatment\r\nare seen, all mankind agree that the abilities of women are far\r\ninferior to those of men.\" Having shown reasons to believe that women\r\nwould take advantage of higher opportunities if such were allowed\r\nthem, \"Discipulus\" maintained in detail that the cultivation of their\r\nminds would improve them for all the accepted feminine duties of life,\r\ncharitable, domestic and social, and that the consequent elevation of\r\nthe female character would react beneficially on the male; cited the\r\nworks of a cluster of eminent authoresses, as showing that women could\r\nthink upon \"the noblest subjects that can exercise the human mind;\"\r\nand closed with the following paragraph, wherein occurred the phrases\r\nby which it is shown that our \"Discipulus\" of twenty is masquerading\r\nas a man, more decisively even than by the termination of the Latin\r\n_nom de guerre_:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot better conclude than with the hope that these examples of\r\nwhat may be done may excite a noble emulation in _their own_ sex, and\r\nin _ours_ such a conviction of the value of the female mind, as shall\r\novercome _our_ long-cherished prejudices, and induce _us_ to give _our_\r\nearnest endeavors to the promotion of _women's_ best interests.\"\r\n\r\nIt is most interesting to thus discover that Harriet Martineau's first\r\nwritings were upon that \"woman question\" which she lived to see make\r\nsuch wonderful advances, and which she so much forwarded, both by her\r\ndirect advocacy, and by the indirect influence of the proof which she\r\nafforded, that a woman may be a thinker upon high topics and a teacher\r\nand leader of men in practical politics, and yet not only be\r\nirreproachable in her private life, but even show herself throughout\r\nit, in the best sense, truly feminine.\r\n\r\nHarriet contributed nothing more to the _Monthly Repository_ after this\r\n(so far as can now be ascertained), for a considerable time. Encouraged\r\nby the success of her first attempts with periodicals, she commenced a\r\nbook of a distinctly religious character, which was issued in the\r\nautumn of the same year, 1823, by Hunter, of St. Paul's Churchyard.\r\n\r\nThe little volume was published anonymously. Its title-page runs thus:\r\n\"_Devotional Exercises_; consisting of Reflections and Prayers for the\r\nuse of Young Persons. To which is added an Address on Baptism. By a\r\nlady.\"\r\n\r\nThe character of the work is perhaps sufficiently indicated by the\r\ntitle. But it would be a mistake to suppose that the book is a\r\ncommonplace one. It contains a good deal of dogmatism and many\r\nplatitudes. It contains, likewise, however, many a noble thought and\r\nmany a high aspiration, expressed in words equally flowing and fervent.\r\nA \"Reflection\" (something like a short sermon) and a prayer are\r\nsupplied for each morning and each evening of the seven days of the\r\nweek. She had already attained to such an insight into the human mind\r\nas to recognize that religious devotion is an exercise of the emotions.\r\nProof, too, is given in this little work of the fullness with which she\r\nrealized that true religion must be expressed by service to mankind; to\r\nthose nearest to one first, and afterwards to others; and indeed, that\r\na high sense of social duty, with a fervent and unselfish devotion to\r\nit, _is_ religion, rather than either the spiritual dram-drinking, or\r\nthe dogmatic irrationality to which that name of high import is\r\nfrequently applied.\r\n\r\nThe prayers in this little volume differ much from the supplications\r\nfor personal benefits which are commonly called prayers.\r\n\r\nThese are rather aspirations, or meditations. The highest moral\r\nattributes, personified in God, are held up for the worship of the\r\nimperfect human creature, with fervent aspiration to approach as\r\nnearly as possible towards that light of unsullied goodness.\r\n\r\nThe lack of petitions for material benefits which appears in these\r\n\"Devotions\" was by no means unconscious, instinctive, or accidental.\r\nShe had deliberately given up the practice of praying for personal\r\nbenefits, partly because she held that, since it is impossible for us\r\nto foresee how far our highest interests may be served or hindered by\r\nchanges in our external circumstances, it is not for us to attempt to\r\nindicate, or even to form a desire, as to what those circumstances\r\nshall be. As regarded the emotional side of her religion, she had come\r\nto prefer to leave herself and her fate to the unquestioned direction\r\nof a higher power.\r\n\r\nBut there was more than this in it. In her philosophical studies, she\r\nhad, of course, met with the eternal debates of metaphysicians and\r\ntheologians on Foreknowledge, Fate, and Freedom of the Will. The\r\ndifficult question had, indeed, presented itself to her active and\r\nacute young mind long before those studies began. She remembered that\r\nwhen she was but eleven years old she found courage to offer her\r\nquestionings upon this point to her elder brother Thomas. She asked:\r\nIf God foreknew from eternity all the evil deeds that every one of us\r\nshould do in our lives, how can He justly punish us for those actions,\r\nwhen the time comes that we are born, and in due course commit them?\r\nHer brother replied merely that she was not yet old enough to\r\nunderstand the point. The answer did not satisfy the child. She knew\r\nthat if she were old enough to feel the difficulty, she must also be\r\nmentally fit to receive some kind of explanation. But under the\r\npastoral influence of Dr. Carpenter, the emotional side of her\r\nreligion was cultivated, and such doubts and difficulties of the\r\nreason were put away for the time.\r\n\r\nNot for all time, however, could the problem be shirked by so active,\r\nlogical, and earnest a mind. It recurred to her when she was left to\r\nher own spiritual guidance. Long before the date of these \"Devotions\"\r\nshe had fought out the battle in her own mind, and had reached the\r\nstandpoint from which her Prayers are written. She had convinced\r\nherself of the truth of the Necessitarian doctrine, that we are what\r\nwe are, we do what we do, because of the impulses given by our\r\nprevious training and circumstances; and that the way to amend any\r\nhuman beings or all mankind is to improve their education, and to give\r\nthem good surroundings and influences, and mental associations; in\r\nshort, that physical and psychological phenomena alike depend upon\r\nantecedent phenomena, called causes.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had thus settled her mind in the doctrine of Necessity,\r\nshe perceived that prayer, in the ordinary sense of the term, had\r\nbecome impossible. If it be believed that all that happens in the\r\nworld is the consequence of the course of the events which have\r\nhappened before, it is clear that no petitions can alter the state of\r\nthings at any given moment. A belief in the efficacy of \"besieging\r\nHeaven with prayers\" implies a supposition that a Supreme Ruler of the\r\nUniverse interferes arbitrarily with the sequence of events. Those\r\nwhose minds are clear that no such arbitrary interference ever does\r\ntake place, but that, on the contrary, like events always and\r\ninvariably follow from like causes, cannot rationally ask for this\r\nfundamental rule of the government of the universe to be set aside for\r\ntheir behoof; even although they may believe in an all-powerful Divine\r\nRuler, who has appointed this sequence of events for the law under\r\nwhich His creatures shall live and develop.\r\n\r\nStill, however, Harriet Martineau supplicated for spiritual benefits,\r\nas we have seen in the little volume of _Devotional Exercises_. These\r\naspirations not only gave her an emotional satisfaction, but were, she\r\nthen thought, justifiable on necessitarian principles; for each time\r\nthat we place our minds in a certain attitude we increase their \"set\"\r\nin the same direction; and she believed at that time that a holy life\r\nwas in this way aided by frequent reflections on and aspirations\r\ntowards the highest ideal of holiness personified in the name of God.\r\n\r\nHer religious belief was, then, pure Theism. To her, it was still very\r\ngood to be a worshipper of Jehovah, the Eternal Presence, the\r\nEver-living Supreme; and Jesus was His Messenger, the highest type\r\nthat He had ever permitted to be revealed to man of the excellencies\r\nof the divine nature. But there was no Atonement, no personal Evil\r\nOne, no hell, no verbally-inspired revelation in her creed.\r\n\r\nIt will be unnecessary to say more about her theological beliefs till\r\nthe next twenty years have been recorded, for in that period there was\r\nsubstantially no change in her views. There did come, indeed, a change\r\nin her method of self-management and in her opinions as to the way in\r\nwhich religious feelings should affect daily life. She soon concluded\r\nthat we are best when least self-conscious about our own goodness, and\r\nthat, therefore, we should rely upon receiving inspiration to right\r\nand elevated feelings from passing influences, and should refrain from\r\nputting our minds, by a regular exercise of volition, into affected\r\npostures in anticipation of those high emotions which we cannot\r\ncommand. Under these beliefs she soon ceased all formal prayer.\r\nMeantime she was still, at twenty-one years old, in the condition of\r\nmind to write _Devotional Exercises_.\r\n\r\nThe little book met with a favorable acceptance among the Unitarians,\r\nand speedily went into the second edition. Thus encouraged, Harriet\r\nbegan another volume of the same character. Such work could not\r\nproceed very fast, however, for her domestic duties were not light,\r\nand her writing was still looked upon in her family as a mere\r\nrecreation. She labored under all the disadvantages of the amateur.\r\nBut events soon began to crowd into her life to alter this view of the\r\ncase, and to prepare the way for her beginning to do the work of her\r\nlife in the only fashion in which such labor can be effectively\r\ncarried on--as a serious occupation, the principal feature of every\r\nday's duties.\r\n\r\nAfter a long period of poverty and distress, caused by the Napoleonic\r\nwars, England, in 1824, experienced the special dangers of a time of\r\nrapidly increasing wealth. There was more real wealth in the country,\r\nowing to the expansion of trade, which followed on the re-opening of\r\nthe continent to our commerce, but speculation made this development\r\nappear far greater than it was in reality.\r\n\r\nThere was, at that time, no sort of check upon the issue of paper\r\nmoney. Not only did the Bank of England send out notes without limit;\r\nnot only could every established bank multiply its drafts recklessly;\r\nbut any small tradesman who pleased might embark in the same business,\r\nand put forth paper money without check or control. Thus there was\r\nmoney in abundance, the rate of interest was low, and prices rose.\r\n\r\nThe natural and inevitable consequence of this state of things, at a\r\nmoment when trade was suddenly revived, was a rage for speculation.\r\nNot only merchants and manufacturers were seized with this epidemic;\r\nthe desire for higher profits than could be obtained by quiet and\r\nperfectly safe investments spread amongst every class. \"As for what\r\nthe speculation was like, it can hardly be recorded on the open page\r\nof history without a blush. Besides the joint-stock companies who\r\nundertook baking, washing, baths, life insurance, brewing,\r\ncoal-portage, wool-growing, and the like, there was such a rage for\r\nsteam navigation, canals and railroads, that in the session of 1825,\r\n438 petitions for private Bills were presented, and 286 private Acts\r\nwere passed.... It is on record that a single share of a mine on which\r\nL70 had been paid, yielded 200 per cent, having risen speedily to a\r\npremium of L1400 per share.\"[5]\r\n\r\n          [5] Harriet Martineau's _History of the Peace_, book ii,\r\n          p. 8.\r\n\r\nPeriods of such inflation invariably and necessarily close in scenes\r\nof disaster. Gold becomes scarce; engagements that have been\r\nrecklessly entered into cannot be met; goods have been produced in\r\nresponse to a speculative instead of a legitimate demand, and\r\ntherefore will not sell; the locked-up capital cannot be released, nor\r\ncan it be temporarily supplied, except upon ruinous terms. Panic\r\ncommences; it spreads over the business world like fire over the dry\r\nprairies. The badly-managed banks and the most speculative business\r\nhouses begin to totter; the weakest of them fall, and the crash brings\r\ndown others like a house of cards; and in the depreciation of goods\r\nand the disappearance of capital, the prudent, sagacious and honorable\r\nmerchant suffers for the folly, the recklessness, the avarice and the\r\ndishonesty of others.\r\n\r\nSuch a crash came, from such causes, in the early winter of 1825.\r\nHarriet Martineau's father was one of those injured by the panic,\r\nwithout having been a party to the errors which produced it. He had\r\nresisted the speculative mania, and allowed it to sweep by him to its\r\nflood. It was, therefore, by no fault of his own that he was caught by\r\nthe ebbing wave, and carried backwards, to be stranded in the\r\nshallows. His house did not fail; but the struggle was a cruel one for\r\nmany months. How severe the crisis was may be judged from the fact\r\nthat between sixty and seventy banks stopped payment within six weeks.\r\n\r\nThe strain of this business anxiety told heavily upon the already\r\ndelicate health of Mr. Thomas Martineau. In the early spring of 1826\r\nit became clear that his days were numbered. Up to the commencement of\r\nthat troubled winter it had been supposed that his daughters would be\r\namply provided for in the event of his death. But so much had been\r\nlost in the crisis, that he found himself, in his last weeks,\r\ncompelled to alter his will, and was only able to leave to his wife\r\nand daughters a bare maintenance. He lingered on till June, and in\r\nthat month he died.\r\n\r\nIt was while Mr. Martineau lay ill, that Harriet's second book,\r\n_Addresses, Prayers, and Hymns_, passed through the press, and the\r\ndying father took great interest and found great comfort in his child's\r\nwork. Much of it he must have read with feelings rendered solemn by his\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThis little volume so closely resembles the _Devotional Exercises_,\r\nthat it is unnecessary to refer to it at greater length. The hymns,\r\nwhich are the special feature of this volume, do not call for much\r\nnotice. They are not quite commonplace; but verse was not Harriet's\r\nnatural medium of expression: she wrote a considerable quantity of it\r\nin her early days, as most young authors do; but she soon came to see\r\nfor herself that her gift of expression in its most elevated form was\r\nrather that which makes the orator than the poet.\r\n\r\nThe comparative poverty to which the family were reduced on Mr.\r\nMartineau's death at once freed Harriet, to a considerable extent,\r\nfrom the obstacles which had previously been interposed to her\r\nspending time in writing. It was still far from being recognized that\r\nliterature was to be her profession; but it was obvious that if her\r\npen could bring any small additions to her income they would be very\r\nserviceable. A friend gave her an introduction to Mr. Houlston, then\r\npublishing at Wellington, Shropshire; and a few little tales, which\r\nshe had lying by, were offered to him. He accepted them, issued them\r\nin tiny volumes, and paid her five guineas for the copyright of each\r\nstory. This, then, was the beginning of Harriet Martineau's\r\nprofessional authorship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nGRIEF STRUGGLE AND PROGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe loss of pecuniary position did something more for Harriet\r\nMartineau besides opening the way to work in literature. The knowledge\r\nthat she was now poor gave her lover courage to declare himself, and\r\nto seek her for his wife. Poverty, therefore, brought her that\r\nexperience which is so much in a woman's mental history, however\r\nlittle it, perhaps, goes for in a man's. A love in youth, fervent,\r\npowerful, and pure; a love, happy and successful in the essential\r\npoint that it is reciprocated by its object, however fate may deny it\r\noutward fruition; such a love once filling a woman's soul, sweetens it\r\nand preserves it for her whole life through. Pity the shriveled and\r\ndecayed old hearts which were not thus embalmed in youth! Harriet\r\nMartineau did have this precious experience; and her womanliness of\r\nnature remained fresh and true and sweet to the end of her days\r\nbecause of it.\r\n\r\nThere may be many married women old maids in heart--to be so is the\r\npunishment of those who marry without love; and there are many, like\r\nHarriet Martineau, who are single in life, but whose hearts have been\r\nmated, and so made alive. I do not know that she would have gained by\r\nmarriage, in any way, except in the chance of motherhood, a yet\r\ngreater fact than love itself to a woman. On the other hand, her work\r\nmust have been hindered by the duties of married life, even if her\r\nmarriage had been thoroughly happy, and her lot free from exceptional\r\nmaterial cares. Matronage is a profession in itself. The duties of a\r\nwife and mother, as domestic life is at present arranged, absorb much\r\ntime and strength, and so diminish the possibilities of intellectual\r\nlabor. Moreover, the laws regulating marriage are still, and fifty\r\nyears ago were far more, in a very bad state; and, leaving a woman\r\nwholly dependent for fair treatment, whether as a wife or mother, upon\r\nthe mercy and goodness of the man she marries, justify Harriet\r\nMartineau's observation: \"The older I have grown, the more serious\r\nhave seemed to me the evils and disadvantages of married life, as it\r\nexists among us at this time.\" The wife who is beloved and treated as\r\nan equal partner in life, the mother whose natural rights in the\r\nguardianship of her family are respected, the mistress of a home in\r\nwhich she is the sunshine of husband and children, must ever be the\r\nhappiest of women. But far better is it to be as Harriet Martineau\r\nwas--a widow of the heart by death--than to have the affections torn\r\nthrough long years by neglect and cruelty, springing less from natural\r\nbadness than from the evil teaching of vile laws and customs. Fifty\r\nyears ago marriage was a dangerous step for a woman; and Harriet\r\nMartineau had reason for saying at last: \"Thus, I am not only entirely\r\nsatisfied with my lot, but think it the very best for me.\"\r\n\r\nFor a while, however, the happy prospect of a beloved wifehood cheered\r\nher struggling and anxious life. But it was not for long. Her actual\r\nand acknowledged engagement lasted, I believe, only a few months. Mr.\r\nWorthington had, at this time, but lately completed his course as a\r\nDivinity student; and he had been appointed to the joint charge of a\r\nvery large Unitarian Church at Manchester. Conscientiousness was one\r\nof the most marked features of his character, according to his college\r\nfriend; and Harriet herself declares that she \"venerated his moral\r\nnature.\" He had thrown himself into the very heavy pastoral work\r\ncommitted to him with all the devotion of this high characteristic.\r\nMoreover, the long doubt and suspense of his love for her before their\r\nengagement, had, doubtless, worked unfavorably upon his nervous\r\nsystem. The end of it was, that he was suddenly seized with a brain\r\nfever, in which he became delirious. He was removed to his father's\r\nhome in Leicestershire, to be nursed; and in process of time, the\r\nfever was subdued. But the mind did not regain its balance. He was\r\nstill, as she says, \"insane\"; but from one of her dear and early\r\nfriends, I hear that \"his family did not call it insanity,\"--only a\r\nfeeble and unhinged state, from which recovery might have been\r\nexpected hopefully.\r\n\r\nIn this state of things it was thought desirable that the woman he\r\nloved should be brought to see him. The beloved presence, his\r\nphysician believed, might revive old impressions and happy\r\nanticipations, and might be the one thing needful to induce a\r\nfavorable change in his condition. His mother wrote to beg Harriet\r\nMartineau to come to him; Harriet eagerly sought her mother's\r\npermission to hasten to his side; and Mrs. Martineau forbade her\r\ndaughter to go. The old habit of obedience to her mother, and the\r\nearly implanted ideas of filial duty, were too strong for Harriet at\r\nonce to break through them; she did not defy her mother and go; and in\r\na few more weeks--terrible weeks of doubt and mental storm they must\r\nhave been, between her love and her obedience dragging her different\r\nways--Worthington died, and left her to her life of heart-widowhood,\r\ndarkened by this shadow of arbitrary separation to the last. \"The\r\ncalamity was aggravated to me,\" she says, \"by the unaccountable\r\ninsults I received from his family, whom I had never seen. Years\r\nafter, the mystery was explained. They had been given to understand,\r\nby cautious insinuation, that I was actually engaged to another while\r\nreceiving my friend's addresses.\" They had not appreciated how\r\nsubmissive she was as a daughter; and their belief that her love was\r\ninsincere was not an unnatural one in the circumstances.\r\n\r\nHad those relatives of the dead lover lived to read Harriet Martineau's\r\nAutobiography, they would not have been made to think differently of\r\nher feelings towards him; for there she goes calmly on, after the\r\npassage above quoted, to say only: \"Considering what I was in those\r\ndays, it was happiest for us both that our union was prevented.\" As we\r\nhave had to look outside the Autobiography for a record of what love\r\nwas to her, and what it did for her, so we must seek elsewhere for the\r\ncry of agony which tells how she felt her loss. But the record exists;\r\nit is found in an essay entitled _In a Death Chamber_, one of that\r\nautobiographical series published in _The Monthly Repository_, from\r\nwhich I have previously quoted.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful piece of writing--far more of a poem in essence than\r\nanything which she ever published in verse--is spoiled as a\r\ncomposition by mutilation in quoting. But its length leaves me no\r\noption but to select from it only a few of the more confessional\r\npassages, to aid us in our psychological study:\r\n\r\n    This weary watch! In watching by the couch of another there is no\r\n    weariness; but this lonely tending of one's own sick heart is more\r\n    than the worn-out spirit can bear. What an age of woe since the\r\n    midnight clock gave warning that my first day of loneliness was\r\n    beginning--to others a Sabbath, to me a day of expiation.\r\n\r\n    All is dull, cold and dreary before me, until I also can escape to\r\n    the region where there is no bereavement, no blasting root and\r\n    branch, no rending of the heart-strings. What is aught to me, in\r\n    the midst of this all-pervading, thrilling torture, when all I\r\n    want is to be dead? The future is loathsome, and I will not look\r\n    upon it; the past, too, which it breaks my heart to think\r\n    about--what has it been? It might have been happy, if there is\r\n    such a thing as happiness; but I myself embittered it at the time,\r\n    and for ever. What a folly has mine been! Multitudes of sins now\r\n    rise up in the shape of besetting griefs. Looks of rebuke from\r\n    those now in the grave; thoughts which they would have rebuked if\r\n    they had known them; moments of anger, of coldness; sympathy\r\n    withheld when looked for; repression of its signs through selfish\r\n    pride; and worse, far worse even than this ... all comes over me\r\n    now. O! if there be pity, if there be pardon, let it come in the\r\n    form of insensibility; for these long echoes of condemnation will\r\n    make me desperate.\r\n\r\n    But was there ever human love unwithered by crime--by crime of\r\n    which no human law takes cognizance, but the unwritten everlasting\r\n    laws of the affections? Many will call me thus innocent. The\r\n    departed breathed out thanks and blessing, and I felt them not\r\n    then as reproaches. If, indeed, I am only as others, shame, shame\r\n    on the impurity of human affections; or, rather, alas! for the\r\n    infirmity of the human heart! For I know not that I could love\r\n    more than I have loved.\r\n\r\n    Since the love itself is wrecked, let me gather up its relics, and\r\n    guard them more tenderly, more steadily, more gratefully. This\r\n    seems to open up glimpses of peace. O grant me power to retain\r\n    them--the light and music of emotion, the flow of domestic wisdom\r\n    and chastened mirth, the life-long watchfulness of benevolence,\r\n    the thousand thoughts--are these gone in their reality? Must I\r\n    forget them as others forget?\r\n\r\n    If I were to see _my_ departed one--that insensible, wasted\r\n    form--standing before me as it was wont to stand, with whom would\r\n    I exchange my joy?... But it is not possible to lose all. The\r\n    shadows of the past may have as great power as their substance\r\n    ever had, and the spirit of human love may ever be nigh, invested\r\n    with a majesty worthy to succeed the lustre of its mortal days.\r\n\r\nThis is the poem of Harriet Martineau's love. This is what remains to\r\nshow that the girl whose intellect was so powerful, and who had\r\nhabitually and of choice exercised her mind upon the most abstruse\r\nstudies and the most difficult thoughts which can engage the\r\nattention, could nevertheless feel at least as fervently, and deliver\r\nherself up to her emotions at least as fully, as any feeble, ignorant,\r\nor narrow-minded creature that ever lived. Surely, with the truth\r\nemphasized by such an example, the common but stupid delusion that the\r\ndevelopment of the intellect diminishes the capacity for passion and\r\ntenderness, must fade away! This girl's mental power and her mental\r\nculture were both unusually large; but here is the core of her heart,\r\nand is it not verily womanly?\r\n\r\nThis experience did more than give her hours of happiness; it did more\r\nthan bring to her that enlargement of the spirit which she so well\r\ndescribed; for it taught her to appreciate, and to properly value, the\r\ninfluence of the emotions in life. Never in one of her works, never in\r\na single phrase, is she found guilty of that blasphemy against the\r\nindividual affections, into which some who have yet sought to pose as\r\nhigh priests of the religion of humanity have fallen and lost\r\nthemselves. In all her writings one finds the continual recognition of\r\nthe great truth which was in the mind of him who said: \"If a man love\r\nnot his brother whom he hath seen, how shall he love God whom he hath\r\nnot seen?\"--a truth of the very first consequence to those who aim at\r\nexpressing their religion by service to the progress of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe year 1826, to Harriet crowded so full of trouble, came to an end\r\nsoon after Mr. Worthington's death. In the following year, though she\r\nwas in very bad health, she wrote a vast quantity of manuscript. Some\r\nof it was published at once. Other portions waited in her desk for a\r\ncouple of years, when her contributions to _The Monthly Repository_\r\nrecommenced, after a change in its editorship.\r\n\r\nShe wrote in the year 1827 various short stories, which were published\r\nby Houlston, of Shrewsbury, without her name on their title-pages.\r\nTheir character may be guessed by the fact that they were circulated\r\nas Mrs. Sherwood's writings! In tone, they resemble the ordinary\r\nSunday-school story-book; but there is a fire, an earnestness, and an\r\noriginality often discoverable in them which are enough to mark them\r\nout from common hack-writing. Two of them, _The Rioters_ and _The Turn\r\nOut_, deal with topics of political economy; but the questions were\r\nthought out (very accurately) in her own mind, for at that time she\r\nhad never read a book upon the subject.\r\n\r\nThese little stories were so successful that the publisher invited her\r\nto write a longer one, which should have her name attached to it. She\r\nwent to work, accordingly, and produced a good little tale, of one\r\nhundred and fifty pages of print, which she called _Principle and\r\nPractice_. It recounts the struggles of an orphan family in their\r\nefforts after independence. As in all her writings of this kind, her\r\nown experience is interfused into the fiction. No part of this story\r\nis so interesting as that where a young man who has met with an\r\naccident has to reconcile his mind to the anticipation of life-long\r\nlameness--as she to deafness. The sisters of this orphan family, too,\r\nmake money by a kind of fancy-work by which she herself was earning a\r\nfew guineas from the wealthier members of her family, namely, by\r\ncutting bags and baskets out of pasteboard, fitting them together with\r\nsilk and gold braid, and painting plaques upon their sides. _Principle\r\nand Practice_ was so warmly received in the circle to which it was\r\nsuited that the publisher called for a sequel, which was accordingly\r\nwritten early in the following year.\r\n\r\nThere was a vast quantity of writing in all these publications; and,\r\nbesides this, she was continually at work with her needle. Such\r\nunremitting sedentary occupation, together with her sorrow, caused a\r\nserious illness, from which she suffered during 1828. It was an\r\naffection of the liver and stomach, for which she went to be treated\r\nby her brother-in-law, Mr. Greenhow, a surgeon at Newcastle-on-Tyne.\r\n\r\nHer remarkable powers of steady application, and her untiring industry,\r\nwere always[6] amongst her most noteworthy characteristics--as,\r\nindeed, is proved by the vast quantity of work she achieved. In each\r\nof her various illnesses, friends who had watched with wonder and\r\nalarm how much she wrote, and how unceasingly she worked, either with\r\npen, or book, or needle in hand, told her that her suffering was\r\ncaused by her merciless industry. Her \"staying power\" was great; she\r\nrarely felt utterly exhausted, and therefore she was impatient of\r\nbeing told that she had, in fact, over-exerted her strength.\r\nSometimes, indeed, she admitted that she worked too much, and pleaded\r\nonly that she could not help it--that the work needed doing, or that\r\nthe thoughts pressed for utterance, and she could not refuse the call\r\nof duty. But more often she said, as in a letter to Mr. Atkinson,\r\nwhich lies before me, \"My best aid and support in the miseries of my\r\nlife has been in _work_--in the intellectual labor which I believe has\r\ndone me nothing but good.\" So her immense industry in 1827 may have\r\nseemed to her a relief from her heart-sorrows at the moment; but none\r\nthe less it probably was the chief cause of her partial breakdown in\r\nthe next year. A blister relieves internal inflammation; but a\r\nsuccession of such stimuli too long continued will exhaust the\r\nstrength, and render the condition more critical than it would have\r\nbeen without such treatment.\r\n\r\n          [6] \"I should think there never was such an industrious\r\n          lady,\" said the maid who was with her for the last eleven\r\n          years of her life; \"when I caught sight of her, just once,\r\n          leaning back in her chair, with her arms hanging down, and\r\n          looking as though she wasn't even thinking about anything,\r\n          it gave me quite a turn. I felt she _must_ be ill to sit\r\n          like that!\"\r\n\r\nAt Newcastle there was a brief cessation from work, under the doctor's\r\norders. But in the middle of 1828 Harriet began to write again for the\r\n_Repository_, in response to an appeal put forth by the editor for\r\ngratuitous literary aid. That editor was the well-known Unitarian\r\npreacher, William Johnston Fox, of South Place Chapel. Mr. Fox became\r\nHarriet Martineau's first literary friend. He had no money with which\r\nto reward her work for his magazine; but he paid her amply in a course\r\nof frank, full, and generous private criticism and encouragement. \"His\r\ncorrespondence with me,\" she says, \"was unquestionably the occasion,\r\nand, in great measure, the cause, of the greatest intellectual\r\nprogress I ever made before the age of thirty.\" Mr. Fox was so acute a\r\ncritic that he ere long predicted that \"she would be one of the first\r\nauthors of the age if she continued to write;\" while, at the same\r\ntime, he offered suggestions for improvement, and made corrections in\r\nher work upon occasion. Her advance in literary capacity was now very\r\nrapid. Her style went on improving, as it should do, till her latest\r\nyears; but it now first became an _individual_ one, easy, flowing,\r\nforcible, and often most moving and eloquent.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter half of 1828 and the early part of the succeeding\r\nyear, she contributed, more or less, to nearly every monthly number of\r\nthe _Repository_, without receiving any payment. She wrote essays,\r\npoems, and so-called reviews, which last, however, were really\r\nthoughtful and original papers, suggested by the subject of a new\r\nbook. Some of these contributions were signed \"V\"; but others,\r\nincluding all the reviews, were anonymous.\r\n\r\nMost of these articles are on philosophical subjects, and are written\r\nwith the calmness of style suitable to logical and argumentative\r\nessays. In the _Repository_ for February, 1829, and the succeeding\r\nmonth, for instance, there appeared two papers, headed, \"On the Agency\r\nof Feelings in the Formation of Habits,\" which are simply an accurate,\r\nclear, and forcibly-reasoned statement of the philosophical doctrine\r\nof Association, with which that of Necessity is inseparably connected.\r\nThese were, it has been already observed, the theories by which she\r\nwas learning both to guide her own action and to see that society is\r\nmoulded, however unconsciously, as regards most of the individuals\r\ncomposing it. A clearer statement of the doctrines, or a more forcible\r\nindication of how they can be made to serve as a moral impulse, cannot\r\nbe imagined. Here is very different work from _Devotional Exercises_,\r\nor _Principle and Practice_. But it brought its author neither fame\r\nnor money.\r\n\r\nAnother piece of work done in 1828, or early in the following year,\r\nwas a _Life of Howard_, which was written on a positive commission\r\nfrom a member of the Committee of Lord Brougham's \"Society for the\r\nDiffusion of Useful Knowledge,\" who promised her thirty pounds for it.\r\nThe MS. was at first said to be lost at the office; eventually she\r\nfound that its contents were liberally cribbed by the writer of the\r\n_Life_ which was published; but she never received a penny of the\r\npromised payment. These were her times of stress, and struggle, and\r\nsuffering, and disappointment, in literature as in ordinary life. Her\r\ngreat success, when at last it did come, was so sudden that her\r\nprevious work was obscured and pushed out of sight in the blaze of\r\ntriumph. But these years of labor, unrecognized and almost unrewarded,\r\nmust not be left out of our view, if we would judge fairly of her\r\ncharacter. Courage, resolution, self-reliance, determination to\r\nconquer in a field once entered upon, are displayed by her quiet\r\nindustrious perseverance through those laborious years. Harriet\r\nMartineau did not make a sudden and easy rush far up the ladder of\r\nfame all at once; her climb, like that of most great men and women,\r\nwas arduous and slow, and her final success proved not only that she\r\nhad literary ability, but also the strength of character which could\r\nwork on while waiting for recognition.\r\n\r\nFresh trouble was yet impending. After Mr. Martineau's death, his son\r\nHenry remained a partner in the weaving business which the father had\r\ncarried on so long; and the incomes (small, but sufficient for a\r\nmaintenance) of the widow and unmarried daughters had to be paid out\r\nof the profits of the factory. Just three years after Mr. Martineau's\r\ndeath, however, in June, 1829, the old house became bankrupt, with but\r\nsmall assets. Mrs. Martineau and her daughters were thus deprived\r\nsuddenly of all means of support.\r\n\r\nThe whole family met this final blow to their fortunes with calm\r\ncourage. It was soon settled that the two girls who possessed all\r\ntheir senses should go out to teach; but Harriet could not be set to\r\nwork in the same way--for pupils could not easily be found who would\r\nsay their lessons into an ear-trumpet. The husband of the lady brought\r\nup by Mrs. Martineau with her youngest daughter tells me that upon\r\nthis occasion Harriet's mother said to her adopted child, \"I have no\r\nfear for any of my daughters, except poor Harriet; the others can\r\nwork, but, with her deafness, I do not know how _she_ can ever earn\r\nher own bread!\"\r\n\r\nThe first resource for Harriet was fancy work of different kinds. \"I\r\ncould make shirts and puddings,\" she declares, \"and iron, and mend,\r\nand get my bread by my needle, if necessary--as it was necessary, for\r\na few months, before I won a better place and occupation with my pen.\"\r\nDuring the winter which followed the failure of the old Norwich house,\r\nshe spent the entire daylight hours poring over fancy-work, by which\r\nalone she could with certainty earn money. But she did not lay aside\r\nthe sterner implement of labor for that bright little bread-winner,\r\nthe needle. After dark she began a long day's literary labor in her\r\nown room.\r\n\r\n    Every night, I believe, I was writing till two, or even three, in\r\n    the morning, obeying always the rule of the house of being present\r\n    at the breakfast-table as the clock struck eight. Many a time I\r\n    was in such a state of nervous exhaustion and distress that I was\r\n    obliged to walk to and fro in the room before I could put on paper\r\n    the last line of a page, or the last half-sentence of an essay or\r\n    review. Yet was I very happy. The deep-felt sense of progress and\r\n    expansion was delightful; and so was the exertion of all my\r\n    faculties; and not least, that of Will to overcome my\r\n    obstructions, and force my way to that power of public speech of\r\n    which I believed myself more or less worthy.\r\n\r\nShe offered the results of this nightly literary toil to a great\r\nnumber of magazine editors and publishers, but without the slightest\r\nsuccess. Totally unknown in London society, having no literary friends\r\nor connections beyond the editor of the obscure magazine of her sect,\r\nher manuscripts were scarcely looked at. Everything that she wrote was\r\nreturned upon her hands, until she offered it in despair to the\r\n_Monthly Repository_, where she was as invariably successful. Her\r\nwork, when published there, however, brought her not an atom of fame,\r\nand only the most trifling pecuniary return. She wrote to Mr. Fox,\r\nwhen she found herself penniless, to tell him that it would be\r\nimpossible for her to continue to render as much gratuitous service as\r\nshe had been doing to the _Repository_; but he could only reply that\r\nthe means at his disposal were very limited, and that the utmost he\r\ncould offer her was L15 a year, for which she was to write \"as much as\r\nshe thought proper.\" With this letter he forwarded her a parcel of\r\nnine books to review, as a commencement. A considerable portion of the\r\nspace in his magazine was filled by Miss Martineau for the next two\r\nyears on these terms.\r\n\r\nThe essay previously referred to, on the \"Agency of Feelings in the\r\nFormation of Habits,\" which appeared in the _Repository_ for February\r\nand March, 1829, was Harriet Martineau's first marked work. It was\r\nfollowed up by a series, commencing in the August of the same year, of\r\n\"Essays on the Art of Thinking,\" which were continued in the magazine\r\nuntil December, when two chapters were given in the one number, in\r\norder, as the editor remarked, that his readers \"might possess entire\r\nin one volume this valuable manual of the Art of Thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"V,\" the writer of these articles, was supposed to be of the superior\r\nsex. In those days, Mr. Fox would have shown rare courage if he had\r\ninformed his readers that they were \"receiving valuable instruction\"\r\nin how to exercise their ratiocinative faculties from the pen of a\r\nwoman. In the Index, I find the references run--\"V.'s\" \"Ode to\r\nReligious Liberty\"; _his_ \"Last Tree of the Forest\"; _his_ \"Essays\r\non the Art of Thinking,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThe \"Essays on the Art of Thinking\" are nothing less than an outline\r\nof Logic. In substance, they present no great originality; but they\r\ndisplay full internal evidence that the thoughts presented were the\r\nwriter's own, and not merely copied from authority. It is really no\r\nlight test of clearness and depth of thought to write on an abstruse\r\nscience in lucid, perspicuous fashion, giving a brief but complete\r\nview of all its parts in their true relations. Only an accurate\r\nthinker, with a mind both capacious and orderly, can perform such a\r\ntask. The highest function of the human mind is, doubtless, that of\r\nthe discoverer. The original thinker, he who observes his facts from\r\nnature at first hand, who compares them, and reasons about them, and\r\ncombines them, and generalizes a principle from them, is the one whom\r\nposterity to all time must honor and reverence for his additions to\r\nthe store of human knowledge. But not far inferior in power, and equal\r\nin immediate usefulness, is the disciple who can judge the\r\noriginator's work, and, finding it perfectly in accordance with facts\r\nas known to him, can receive it into his mind, arrange it in order,\r\ndeck it with illustration, illuminate it with power of language, and\r\nrepresent it in a form suitable for general comprehension. There is\r\noriginality of mind needed for such work; that which is done, the\r\nadaptation of the truths to be received to the receptive powers of the\r\nmultitude, is an original work performed upon the truths, hardly\r\ninferior in difficulty and utility to that of him who first discerns\r\nthem. This was the class of work which Harriet Martineau was beginning\r\nto do, and to do well. But there was more than this in her purposes.\r\n\r\nAs these articles, though vastly inferior in execution to what she\r\nafterwards did, nevertheless show the essential characteristics of her\r\nwork, this seems to be the most favorable opportunity to pause to\r\ninquire what was the special feature of her writings. For, various\r\nthough her subjects appear to be, ranging from the humblest topics,\r\nsuch as the duties of maids-of-all-work, up to the highest themes of\r\nmental and political philosophy, yet I find one informing idea, one\r\nand the same moving impulse to the pen of the writer, throughout the\r\nwhole series. Let us see what it was that she really, though half\r\nunconsciously perhaps, kept before her as her aim.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious at once that her writings are all designed to _teach_.\r\nA little closer consideration shows that what they seek to teach is\r\nalways _what is right conduct_. Abstract truth merely as such does not\r\ncontent her. She seeks its practical concrete application to daily\r\nlife. Further, not merely has she the aim of teaching morals, but she\r\ninvariably makes _facts_ and _reasonings from facts the basis_ of her\r\nmoral teachings. In other words, she approaches morals from the\r\nscientific instead of the intuitional side; and to thus influence\r\nconduct is the invariable final object of her writings.\r\n\r\nIt would sound simpler to say that she wrote on the science of morals.\r\nBut the term \"moral science\" has already been appropriated to a class\r\nof writing than which nothing could, very often, less deserve the name\r\nof science. The work which Harriet Martineau spent her whole life in\r\ndoing, was, however, true work in moral science. What she was ever\r\nseeking to do was to find out how men should live from what men and\r\ntheir surroundings are. She must be recognized as one of the first\r\nthinkers to uniformly consider practical morals as derived from\r\nreasoned science.\r\n\r\nMany of the articles contributed to the _Repository_ were naturally,\r\nfrom the character of the publication, upon theology. Much that is\r\nnoticeable might be culled from amongst them; as, indeed, could be\r\ninferred from the fact that an able leader of her religious body\r\nallowed her to fill so very large a portion of the pages by which,\r\nunder his guidance, the Unitarian public were instructed. In all the\r\nessays, a distinguishing feature is the earnestness of the effort put\r\nforth to judge the questions at issue by reason, and not by prejudice.\r\nIt is true that the effort often fails. There comes the moment at\r\nwhich faith in dogma intervenes, and submerges the pure argument; but\r\nnone the less do the spirit of justice and fairness, and the love of\r\ntruth, irradiate the whole of these compositions.\r\n\r\nMr. Fox soon asked her if she thought that any of her ideas could be\r\nexpressed through the medium of fiction. It so happened that the\r\nsuggestion precisely fell in with a thought that had already occurred\r\nto her that \"of all delightful tasks, the most delightful would be to\r\ndescribe, with all possible fidelity, the aspect of the life and land\r\nof the Hebrews, at the critical period of the full expectation of\r\nthe Messiah.\" She wrote a story which she called _The Hope of the\r\nHebrews_, in which a company of young people, relatives and friends,\r\nwere shown as undergoing the alternations of doubt and hope about\r\nwhether this teacher was indeed Messiah, on the first appearance\r\nof Jesus in Palestine. The day after this story appeared in the\r\n_Repository_ Mr. Fox was at an anniversary dinner of the sect, where\r\nso many persons spoke to him about the tale, that he wrote and\r\ngenerously advised Harriet not to publish any more such stories in his\r\nmagazine, but to make a book of them. She adopted the suggestion; the\r\nlittle volume was issued with her name, and proved her first decisive\r\nsuccess. Not only was it well circulated and highly appreciated in\r\nEngland, but it was translated into French, under high ecclesiastical\r\nsanction, and was also immediately reproduced in the United States.\r\n\r\nWhile this book was in the press, she went to stay for a short time in\r\nLondon. Mr. Fox, hearing from her how anxious she was to earn her\r\nlivelihood by literature, succeeded in obtaining from a printer friend\r\nof his an offer for her to do \"proof correcting and other drudgery,\"\r\nif she liked to remain in London for the work. This would have given\r\nher a small but certain income, and there could be little doubt that,\r\nif she stayed in London, she would gradually get into some\r\njournalistic employment which would enable her to support herself\r\ntolerably well. There were no great hopes in the matter. Mr. Fox told\r\nher that \"one hundred or one hundred and fifty pounds a year is as\r\nmuch as our most successful writers usually make\"--success here\r\nmeaning, of course, full employment in hackwork. It had not yet\r\noccurred, even to Mr. Fox, that she was to be really a successful\r\nauthor. But to do even this drudgery, and to take the poor chance now\r\noffered to her, implied that she must make her home in London; and she\r\nwrote to inform her mother of this fact.\r\n\r\nThe same post which carried Harriet's letter to this effect, bore to\r\nMrs. Martineau a second missive, from the relative with whom her\r\ndaughter was staying, which strongly advised that Harriet should be\r\nrecalled home, there to pursue the needle-work by which she had proved\r\nshe could earn money. The good lady had been wont to ask Harriet day\r\nby day \"how much she would get\" for the literary labor upon which she\r\nhad expended some hours; and the poor young author's reply not being\r\nsatisfactory or precise, her hostess looked upon the time spent at the\r\ndesk as so much wasted. She gave Harriet some pieces of silk, \"lilac,\r\nblue, and pink,\" and advised her to keep to making little bags and\r\nbaskets, which the kind friend generously promised to assist in\r\ndisposing of for good coin of the realm.\r\n\r\nThe mother who had stood between her full-grown daughter and the bed\r\nof a dying betrothed, now thought herself justified in interposing\r\nbetween the woman of twenty-seven and the work which she desired to\r\nundertake for her independence. Mrs. Martineau sent Harriet a stern\r\nletter, peremptorily ordering her to return home forthwith. Bitterly\r\ndisappointed at seeing this chance of independence in the vocation she\r\nloved thus snatched away, Harriet's sense of filial duty led her to\r\nobey her mother's commands. She went home with a heavy heart; and with\r\nequal sadness, her little sister of eighteen turned out of home, at\r\nthe same despotic bidding, to go a-governessing. \"My mother received\r\nme very tenderly. She had no other idea at the moment than that she\r\nhad been doing her best for my good.\"\r\n\r\nHarriet did not return to Norwich entirely discouraged. Resolution\r\nsuch as hers was not easily broken down. The British and Foreign\r\nUnitarian Association had advertised three prizes for the best essays\r\ndesigned to convert Roman Catholics, Jews and Mohammedans respectively\r\nto Unitarianism. The sum offered for each was but small: ten guineas\r\nfor the Catholic, fifteen for the Jewish, and twenty for the\r\nMohammedan essays. But it was less the money than interest in the\r\ncause, and desire to see if she could succeed in competition with\r\nothers, that led Harriet to form the intention of trying for _all\r\nthree_ prizes.\r\n\r\nShe went to work immediately upon the Catholic essay, which was to be\r\nadjudicated upon six months earlier than the other two. When it was\r\nfinished, she paid a schoolboy, who wrote a good hand, a sovereign\r\nthat she could ill spare, for copying the essay, which was about\r\ntwo-thirds the length of this volume. The essays were to be\r\nsuperscribed, as usual in such competitions, with a motto, and the\r\nwriter's name and address had to be forwarded in a sealed envelope,\r\nwith the same motto outside. In September, 1830, she received the\r\ngratifying news that the committee of adjudication had unanimously\r\nawarded this prize to her.\r\n\r\nThe other two essays were commenced with the spirit induced by this\r\nsuccess. One of them was copied out by a poor woman, the other by a\r\nschoolmaster. Harriet was careful even to have the two essays written\r\nupon different sorts of paper, to do them up in differently shaped\r\npackages, and to use separate kinds of wax and seals.\r\n\r\nThe sequel may be told, with all the freshness of the moment, in a\r\nquotation from the _Monthly Repository_ for May, 1831: \"We were about\r\nto review it [_i.e._ the Catholic essay] when the somewhat startling\r\nfact transpired of her having carried off the other premiums offered\r\nby the Association's committee for tracts addressed to the Mohammedans\r\nand the Jews. We shall not now stop to inquire how it has happened\r\nthat our ministers would not or could not prevent the honor of\r\nchampioning the cause of pure Christianity against the whole\r\ntheological world from developing upon a young lady. However that\r\nmay be, she has won the honor and well deserves to wear it.\"\r\n\r\nThe essays were published by the Unitarian Association. There can be\r\nlittle doubt that, however many ministers may have competed, the\r\nCommittee did select the best papers offered to their choice. The\r\nlearning in all is remarkable; the freedom from sectarian bitterness,\r\nfrom bigotry, and from the insolent assumption of moral and religious\r\nsuperiority, is even more striking, in such proselytising\r\ncompositions.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting the result of the prize competition, Harriet wrote a\r\nlong story for young people, which she called _Five Years of Youth_.\r\nIt is one of the prettiest and most attractive of all her writings of\r\nthis class. It has a moral object, of course--a somewhat similar one\r\nto that of Jane Austen's _Sense and Sensibility_; but the warning\r\nagainst allowing sensitiveness to pass into sentimentality is here\r\ndirected to girls just budding into womanhood; and the punishment for\r\nthe error is not a love disappointment, but the diminution of the\r\npower of domestic and social helpfulness.\r\n\r\nHarriet's work of this year, 1830, comprised the doing of much\r\nfancy-work for sale, making and mending everything that she herself\r\nwore, knitting stockings even while reading, studying a course of\r\nGerman literature, and writing for the press the following quantity of\r\nliterary matter:--_Traditions of Palestine_, a duodecimo volume of 170\r\nprinted pages; _Five Years of Youth_, 264 small octavo pages; three\r\ntheological essays, making a closely printed crown octavo volume of\r\n300 pages; and fifty-two articles of various lengths in the twelve\r\nnumbers of the _Monthly Repository_.\r\n\r\nAnd now she had touched the highest point of sectarian fame. The\r\nchosen expositor to the outer world of her form of religion, and the\r\nwriter of its favorite Sunday School story-book of the hour, she must\r\nalready have felt that her industrious, resolute labor through many\r\nyears had at last borne some fruit.\r\n\r\nBut the moment for wider fame and a greater usefulness was now at\r\nhand. In the autumn of 1827 she had read Mrs. Marcet's _Conversations\r\non Political Economy_, and had become aware that the subject which she\r\nhad thought out for herself, and treated in her little stories of _The\r\nRioters_, and _The Turn-Out_, was a recognized science. She followed\r\nthis up by a study of Adam Smith, and other economists, and the idea\r\nthen occurred to her that it might be possible to illustrate the whole\r\nsystem of political economy by tales similar in style to those she had\r\nalready written. The thought had lain working in her mind for long,\r\nand, in this autumn of 1831, the idea began to press upon her as a\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nThere were many reasons why it was especially necessary just then that\r\nthe people should be brought to think about Social Science. The times\r\nwere bitter with the evils arising from unwise laws. None knew better\r\nthan she did how largely the well-being of mankind depends upon causes\r\nwhich cannot be affected by laws. It is individual conduct which must\r\nmake or mar the prosperity of the nation. But, on the other hand, laws\r\nare potent, both as direct causes of evil conditions (and in a less\r\ndegree of good conditions), and from their educational influence upon\r\nthe people. Harriet Martineau felt that she had come to see more\r\nclearly than the masses of her fellow-countrymen exactly how far the\r\nmiseries under which English society groaned were caused directly or\r\nindirectly by mischievous legislative acts. Moreover, the\r\ncircumstances of the moment made the imparting of such knowledge not\r\nonly possible, but specially opportune. The Bishops had just thrown\r\nout the Reform Bill; but no person who watched the temper of the time\r\ncould doubt that their feeble opposition would be speedily swept\r\naside, and that self-government was about to be extended to a new\r\nclass of the people. Most suitable was the occasion, then, for\r\noffering information to these upon the science and art of society.\r\nHarriet was right in her judgment when she started her project of a\r\nseries of tales illustrative of Political Economy, under a \"thorough,\r\nwell-considered, steady conviction that the work was wanted, was even\r\ncraved for by the popular mind.\"\r\n\r\nShe began to write the first of her stories. The next business was to\r\nfind a publisher to share her belief that the undertaking would be\r\nacceptable to the public. She wrote to one after another of the great\r\nLondon publishers, receiving instant refusal to undertake the series\r\nfrom all but two; and even these two, after giving her a little of\r\nthat delusive hope which ends by plunging the mind into deeper\r\ndespair, joined with their brethren in declining to have anything to\r\ndo with the scheme.\r\n\r\nFinally, she went to London to try if personal interviews would bring\r\nher any better success. She stayed in a house attached to a brewery\r\n(Whitbread's), belonging to a cousin of hers, and situated near the\r\nCity Road. Thence, she tramped about through the mud and sleet of\r\nDecember to the publishers' offices day after day for nearly three\r\nweeks. The result was always failure. But though she returned to the\r\nhouse worn-out and dispirited, her determination that the work should\r\nbe done never wavered, and night after night she sat up till long\r\nafter the brewery clock struck twelve, the pen pushing on in her\r\ntrembling hand, preparing the first two numbers of the series, to be\r\nready for publication when the means should be found.\r\n\r\nIt was the kind friend who had helped her before who came to the\r\nrescue at last at this crisis. Mr. W. J. Fox induced his brother\r\nCharles to make her proposals for publishing her series.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Fox took care to offer only such arrangement as should\r\nindemnify him from all risk in the undertaking. He required, first,\r\nthat five hundred subscribers should be obtained for the work; and\r\nsecond, that he, the publisher, should receive about seventy-five per\r\ncent of the possible profits. Hopeless of anything better, she\r\naccepted these hard terms, and it was arranged that the first number\r\nshould appear with February, 1832.\r\n\r\nThe original stipulation as to the time that this agreement should run\r\nwas that the engagement should be terminable by either party at the\r\nend of every five numbers. But a few days afterwards, when Harriet\r\ncalled upon Mr. W. J. Fox to show him her circular inviting\r\nsubscribers for the series, she found that Mr. Charles Fox had decided\r\nto say that he would not publish more than two numbers, unless a\r\nthousand copies of No. I were sold in the first fortnight! This\r\ndecision had been arrived at chiefly in consequence of a conversation\r\nwhich W. J. Fox had held with James Mill, in which the distinguished\r\npolitical economist had pronounced against the essential point of the\r\nscheme--the narrative form--and had advised that, if the young lady\r\nmust try her hand at Political Economy, she should write it in the\r\northodox didactic style.\r\n\r\nMr. Fox lived at Dalston. When Harriet left his house, after receiving\r\nthis unreasonable and discouraging ultimatum, she \"set out to walk the\r\nfour miles and a half to the Brewery. I could not afford to ride more\r\nor less; but, weary already, I now felt almost too ill to walk at all.\r\nOn the road, not far from Shoreditch, I became too giddy to stand\r\nwithout some support; and I leaned over some dirty palings, pretending\r\nto look at a cabbage-bed, but saying to myself as I stood with closed\r\neyes, 'My book will do yet.'\"\r\n\r\nThat very night she wrote the long, thoughtful, and collected preface\r\nto her work. After she had finished it she sat over the fire in her\r\nbedroom, in the deepest depression; she cried, with her feet on the\r\nfender, till four o'clock, and then she went to bed, and cried there\r\ntill six, when she fell asleep. But if any persons suppose that\r\nbecause the feminine temperament finds a relief in tears, the fact\r\nargues weakness, they will be instructed by hearing that she was up by\r\nhalf-past eight, continuing her work as firmly resolved as ever that\r\nit should be published.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT SUCCESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe work which had struggled into printed existence with such extreme\r\ndifficulty raised its author at a bound to fame. Ten days after the\r\npublication of the first number, Charles Fox sent Harriet word that\r\nnot only were the fifteen hundred copies which formed the first\r\nedition all sold off, but he had such orders in hand that he proposed\r\nto print another five thousand at once. The people had taken up the\r\nwork instantly. The press followed, instead of leading the public in\r\nthis instance; but it, too, was enthusiastic in praise, both of the\r\nscheme and the execution of the stories.\r\n\r\nMore than one publisher who had previously rejected the series made\r\novertures for it now. Its refusal, as they saw, had been one of those\r\nstriking blunders of which literary history has not a few to tell. But\r\nthere is no occasion to cry out about the stupidity of publishers.\r\nThey can judge well how far a work written on lines already popular\r\nwill meet the demand of the market; but an entirely original idea, or\r\nthe work of an original writer, is a mere lottery. There is no telling\r\nhow the public will take it until it has been tried. Publishers put\r\ninto a good many such lotteries, and often lose by them; then nothing\r\nmore is heard of the matter. But the cases where they decline a\r\nspeculation which afterwards turns out to have been a good one are\r\nnever forgotten. Still, the fact remains that it was Harriet Martineau\r\nalone who saw that the people needed her work, and whose wonderful\r\ncourage and resolution brought it out for the public to accept.\r\n\r\nHer success grew, as an avalanche gains in volume, by its own\r\nmomentum. Besides the publishers' communications she had letters, and\r\npamphlets, and blue-books, and magazines forwarded to her in piles, in\r\norder that she might include the advocacy of the senders' hobbies in\r\nher series. One day the postmaster sent her a message that she must\r\nlet a barrow be fetched for her share of the mail, as it was too bulky\r\nto come in any other way. Lord Brougham declared, that it made him\r\ntear his hair to think that the Society for the Diffusion of\r\nKnowledge, which he had instituted for the very purpose of doing such\r\nwork as she was undertaking, seemed not to have a man in it with as\r\nmuch sense of what was wanted as this little deaf girl at Norwich. The\r\npublic interest in the work was, perhaps, heightened by the fact that\r\nso ignorant was everybody of her personality, that this description of\r\nBrougham's passed muster. But she was not little, and she was now\r\ntwenty-nine years of age.\r\n\r\nShe stayed in Norwich, going on writing hard, until the November of\r\n1832, by which time eight numbers of her series had appeared. Then she\r\nwent to London, taking lodgings with an old servant of Mrs.\r\nMartineau's, who lived in Conduit street. In the course of a few\r\nmonths, however, Mrs. Martineau settled herself in London, and her\r\ndaughter again resided with her, in a house in Fludyer street,\r\nWestminster.\r\n\r\nThe purely literary success which she had hitherto enjoyed was now\r\nturned into a social triumph. However she might strive against being\r\nlionized she could not avoid the attentions and honors that were\r\npoured upon her. It is little to say that all the distinguished people\r\nin town hastened to know her; it was even considered to give\r\ndistinction to a party if she could be secured to attend it. Literary\r\ncelebrities, titled people, and members of Parliament, competed for\r\nthe small space of time that she could spare for society.\r\n\r\nThis was not very much, for the work she had undertaken was heavy\r\nenough to absorb all her energies. She had engaged to produce one of\r\nher stories every month. They were issued in small paper-covered\r\nvolumes of from one hundred and twenty to one hundred and fifty pages\r\nof print. She began publication with only two or three numbers ready\r\nwritten. Thus, to keep on with her series, she had to write one whole\r\nnumber every month. It would have been hard work had it been simple\r\nstory-telling, had she been merely imaginatively reproducing scenes\r\nand characters from her past experience, or writing according to her\r\nfancy. But it was, in fact, a much more difficult labor upon which she\r\nwas engaged. Her scheme required that she should embody every shade of\r\nvariety of the human character; that her scenes should be laid in\r\ndifferent parts of the world, with topography and surroundings\r\nappropriate to the story; and that the governments and social state of\r\nall these various places should be accurately represented. In addition\r\nto all this she had to lay down for each tale the propositions which\r\nhad to be illustrated in it; to assure herself that she clearly saw\r\nthe truth and the bearings of every doctrine of political economy; and\r\nthen to work into a connected fiction in a concrete form the abstract\r\ntruths of the science--representing them as exemplified in the lives\r\nof individuals.\r\n\r\nPolitical economy treats of the production, distribution and\r\nconsumption, or use, of all the material objects of human desire,\r\nwhich are called by the general name of wealth. Thus, it is a subject\r\nwhich concerns every one of us in our daily lives, and not merely a\r\nmatter belonging (as its name unfortunately leads many to suppose)\r\nentirely to the province of the legislator. The great mass of mankind\r\nare producers of wealth. All are necessarily consumers--for the bare\r\nmaintenance of existence demands the consumption of wealth. The\r\nwell-being of the community depends upon the industry and skill with\r\nwhich wealth is produced; upon the distribution of it in such a manner\r\nas to encourage future production; and upon the consumption of it with\r\ndue regard to the claims of the future. It is individuals who, as the\r\nbusiness of common life, produce, exchange, divide and consume wealth;\r\nit is, therefore, each individual's business to comprehend the science\r\nwhich treats of his daily life. A science is nothing but a collection\r\nof facts, considered in their relationship to each other. Miss\r\nMartineau's plan, in her series, was strictly what I have indicated as\r\nbeing always her aim; namely, to deduce from an abstract science rules\r\nfor daily life--the secondary, practical or concrete science. It was\r\nthe union of a scientific basis with practical morals that made this\r\nsubject attractive to her mind, and led her (in the words of her\r\npreface,) to \"propose to convey the leading truths of political\r\neconomy, as soundly, as systematically, as clearly and faithfully, as\r\nthe utmost painstaking and the strongest attachment to the subject\r\nwill enable us to do.\"\r\n\r\nShe did her work very methodically. Having first noted down her own\r\nideas on the branch of the subject before her, she read over the\r\nchapters relating to it in the various standard works that she had at\r\nhand, making references as she read. The next thing to do was to draw\r\nout as clearly and concisely as possible the truths that she had to\r\nillustrate; this \"summary of principles,\" as she called it, was\r\naffixed to each tale. By this time she would see in what part of the\r\nworld, and amongst what class of people, the principles in question\r\nwere operating most manifestly; and if this consideration dictated the\r\nchoice of a foreign background, the next thing to be done was to get\r\nfrom a library works of travel and topography, and to glean hints from\r\nthem for local coloring.\r\n\r\nThe material thus all before her in sheets of notes, she reduced it to\r\nchapters; sketching out the characters of her _dramatis personae_,\r\ntheir action, and the features of the scenes, and also the political\r\neconomy which they had to convey either by exemplification or by\r\nconversation. Finally, she paged her paper. Then \"the story went off\r\nlike a letter. I did it,\" she says, \"as I write letters; never\r\naltering the expression as it came fresh from my brain.\"\r\n\r\nI have seen the original manuscript of one of the Political Economy\r\nTales. It shows the statement just quoted to be entirely accurate. The\r\nwriting has evidently been done as rapidly as the hand could move;\r\nevery word that will admit of it is contracted, to save time. \"Socy.,\"\r\n\"opporty.,\" \"agst.,\" \"abt.,\" \"independce.,\" these were amongst the\r\nabbreviations submitted to the printer's intelligence; not to mention\r\ncommoner and more simple words, such as wh., wd., and the like. The\r\ncalligraphy, though very readable, has a somewhat slipshod look.\r\nThus, there is every token of extremely rapid composition. Yet the\r\ncorrections on the MS. are few and trifling; the structure of a\r\nsentence is never altered, and there are but seldom emendations even\r\nof principal words. The manuscript is written (in defiance of law and\r\norder) on both sides of the paper; the latter being quarto, of the\r\nsize now commonly called _sermon_ paper, but, in those pre-envelope\r\nages, it was letter paper.\r\n\r\nHer course of life in London was as follows: she wrote in the morning,\r\nrising, and making her own coffee at seven, and going to work\r\nimmediately after breakfast until two. From two till four she saw\r\nvisitors. Having an immense acquaintance, she declined undertaking to\r\nmake morning calls; but people might call upon her any afternoon. She\r\nwas charged with vanity about this arrangement; but, with the work on\r\nher hands and the competition for her company, she really could not do\r\ndifferently. Still, Sydney Smith suggested a better plan; he told her\r\nshe should \"hire a carriage, and engage an inferior authoress to go\r\nround in it to drop the cards!\" After any visitors left, she went out\r\nfor her daily \"duty walk,\" and returned to glance over the newspapers,\r\nand to dress for dinner. Almost invariably she dined out, her host's\r\nor some other friend's carriage being commonly sent to fetch her. One\r\nor two evening parties would conclude the day, unless the literary\r\npressure was extreme, in which case she would sometimes write letters\r\nafter returning home. During the whole time of writing her series, she\r\nwas satisfied with from five to six hours' sleep out of the\r\ntwenty-four; and though she was not a teetotaller, but drank wine at\r\ndinner, still she took no sort of stimulant to help her in her work.\r\n\r\nThis was the course of life that a woman, of no extraordinary physical\r\nstrength, was able to maintain with but little cessation or interval\r\nfor two years. When I look at the thirty-four little volumes which she\r\nproduced in less than as many months, and when I consider the\r\ncharacter of their contents, I am bound to say that I consider the\r\nfeat of mere industry unparalleled, within my knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe _Illustrations of Political Economy_ are plainly and inevitably\r\ndamaged, as works of art, by the fact that they are written to convey\r\ndefinite lessons. The fetters in which the story moves are necessarily\r\nfar closer than in the ordinary \"novel with a purpose;\" for here the\r\nobject is not merely to show the results, upon particular characters\r\nor upon individual careers, of a certain course of conduct, and thence\r\nto argue that in similar special circumstances all persons would\r\nexperience similar consequences: but the task here is to show in\r\noperation those springs of the social machinery by which we are _all_,\r\ngenerally quite unconsciously, guided in our _every-day_ actions, the\r\nnatural laws by which _all_ our lives are _inevitably_ governed. To do\r\nthis, the author was compelled to select scenes from common life, and\r\nto eschew the striking and the unusual. Again, it was absolutely\r\nnecessary that much of the doctrine which had to be taught must be\r\nconveyed by dialogue; not because it would not be possible to\r\nexemplify in action every theory of political economy--for all those\r\ntheories have originally been derived from observation of the facts of\r\nhuman history--but because no such a small group of persons and such a\r\nlimited space of time as must be taken to _tell a story about_, can\r\npossibly display the whole consequences of many of the laws of social\r\nscience. The results of our daily actions as members of society are\r\nnot so easily visible as they would be if we could wholly trace them\r\nout amongst our own acquaintances or in our own careers. The\r\nconsequences of our own conduct, good or bad, must _come round_ to us,\r\nit is true, but often only as members of the body politic. Thus, they\r\nare very often in a form as little distinguishable to the uninstructed\r\nmind as we may suppose it would be comprehensible to the brain, if the\r\norgans of the body had a separate consciousness, that it was\r\nresponsible for its own aches arising from the disturbance of the\r\nliver consequent upon intemperance. But in a tale it is obviously\r\nimpossible to show _in action_ any more of the working of events than\r\ncan be exemplified in one or two groups of persons, all of whom must\r\nbe, however slightly, personally associated. The larger questions and\r\nprinciples at issue must be expounded and argued out in conversations,\r\nor else by means of an entire lapse from the illustrative to the\r\ndidactic method. Now, as ordinary people do not go about the world\r\nholding long conversations or delivering themselves of dissertations\r\non political economy, it is clear that the introduction of such talks\r\nand preachments detracts from the excellence of the story as a work of\r\nart. Still less artistically admirable does the fiction become when a\r\nlesson is introduced as a separate argument intruded into the course\r\nof the tale.\r\n\r\nPolitical economy as a science was then but fifty years old. Adam\r\nSmith had first promulgated its fundamental truths in his immortal\r\n_Wealth of Nations_, in 1776. Malthus, Ricardo, and one or two others\r\nhad since added to the exposition of the facts and the relationship\r\nbetween the facts (that is to say, the science) of social\r\narrangements. But it was not then--nor is it, indeed, yet, in an age\r\nwhen the great rewards of physical research have attracted into that\r\nfield nearly all the best intellects for science of the time--a\r\ncomplete body of reasoned truths. Some of the positions laid down by\r\nall the earlier writers are now discredited; others are questioned. In\r\na few passages, accordingly, these tales teach theories which would\r\nnow require revision. It must be added at once that these instances\r\nare few and far between. The reasoning, the grasp of the facts of\r\nsocial life and the logical acumen with which they are dissected and\r\nexplained in these tales are, generally speaking, nearly perfect, and\r\ntherefore such as all competent students of the subject would at this\r\nday indorse. The slips in exposition of the science as it was then\r\nunderstood are _exceedingly_ rare. Greater clearness, and more\r\nprecision, and better arrangement could hardly have been attained had\r\nyears been spent upon the work, in revising, correcting, and\r\nre-copying, instead of each \"Illustration\" being written in a month,\r\nand sent to press with hardly a phrase amended.\r\n\r\nThe accuracy and excellence in the presentation of the science were\r\nadmitted at once by the highest authorities. Mr. James Mill early made\r\nhonorable amends for his previous doubts as to the possibility of Miss\r\nMartineau's success. Whately and Malthus expressed their admiration of\r\nthe work. Lord Brougham called upon her, and engaged her pen to\r\nillustrate the necessity for reform in the treatment of the social\r\ncanker of pauperism. The Gurneys, and the rest of the Quaker members\r\nof Parliament got Mrs. Fry to make an appointment to ask Miss\r\nMartineau's advice as to their action in the House on the same\r\nsubject, when it was ripe for legislation. The Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer (Lord Althorp) even sent his private secretary (Mr.\r\nDrummond, the author of the world-famous phrase \"Property has its\r\nduties as well as its rights\") to supply Miss Martineau with\r\ninformation to enable her to prepare the public for the forthcoming\r\nBudget. The chairman of the Royal Commission on Excise Taxes gave her\r\nthe manuscript of the evidence taken, and the draft of the report of\r\nthe Commission, before they were formally presented to the Ministers\r\nof the Crown (a thing without precedent!), in order that she might use\r\nthe facts to pave the way for the reception of the report in the House\r\nand by the people. The whole public of male students of her science\r\npaid her work what men consider in their unconscious insolence to be\r\nthe highest compliment that they _can_ pay a woman's work: the\r\nmilder-mannered ones said she had \"a masculine intelligence\"; the\r\nstronger characters went further, and declared that the books were so\r\ngood that it was impossible to believe them to be written by a woman.\r\nNewspaper critics not infrequently attributed them to Lord Brougham,\r\nthen Lord Chancellor; that versatile and (at the moment) most popular\r\npolitician was supposed either to write them all himself, or to supply\r\ntheir main features for the inferior mind to throw into shape.\r\n\r\nWhile statesmen, politicians, thinkers, and students were thus\r\npraising the clearness and appreciating the power of the work as\r\npolitical economy, the general public eagerly bought and read the\r\nbooks, both for their bearing on the legislative questions of the day\r\nand for their vividness and interest as stories. And indeed, they\r\nrichly deserved to be read as works of fiction. Remembering the\r\nlimitations to their artistic excellence previously adverted to, they\r\nmay be with justice praised for most of the essential features of good\r\nnovel-writing.\r\n\r\nThe characters are the strongest point. Clearly individualized,\r\nconsistently carried out, thinking, speaking, and acting in accordance\r\nwith their nature, the characters are always personages; and some of\r\nthem must live long in the memories of those who have made their\r\nacquaintance. The sterner virtues in Cousin Marshall, in Lady F----,\r\nin Ella of Garveloch, and in Mary Kay, are no less clearly and\r\nattractively depicted than the milder and more passive ones in the\r\npatience of Christian Vanderput, in the unconscious devotion to duty\r\nof Nicholas, in the industry and hopefulness of Frank and Ellen\r\nCastle, in the wifely love and agony of Hester Morrison, in the quiet\r\npublic spirit of Charles Guyon, in the proved patriotism of the Polish\r\nexiles, and in a dozen other instances. Her feelings and her spirit\r\nare at home in depicting these virtues of the character; but none the\r\nless does she well succeed in realizing both vice and folly. Her real\r\ninsight into character was quite remarkable; as Dr. Martineau observed\r\nto me, when he said, \"My sister's powers of observation were\r\nextraordinary.\" If, on the one hand, her deafness often prevented her\r\nfrom appreciating the delicacies and the chances of verbal expression\r\n(which really reveal so much of the nature) in those around her, so\r\nthat she was apt to draw sharper lines than most people do between the\r\nsheep and the goats in her estimation; on the other hand, she saw more\r\nthan those whose minds are distracted by sounds, the light and play of\r\nthe countenance, and the indications of character in trivial actions.\r\nThe excellence of her character-drawing in these novels gives abundant\r\nevidence that the disqualification was more than counterbalanced by\r\nthe cultivation of the other faculty.\r\n\r\nThe unconsciousness of her mental analysis is at once its greatest\r\ncharm and the best token of its truthfulness. Florence Nightingale\r\nrealized how fully this was so with reference to the finer qualities\r\nof morals. In her tribute to Harriet Martineau's memory Miss\r\nNightingale justly observes:--\r\n\r\n    In many parts of her _Illustrations of Political Economy_--for\r\n    example, the death of a poor drinking-woman, \"Mrs. Kay,\"--what\r\n    higher religious feeling (or _one should rather say instinct_)\r\n    could there be? To the last she had religious feeling--in the\r\n    sense of good working out of evil into a supreme wisdom\r\n    penetrating and moulding the whole universe; into the natural\r\n    subordination of intellect and intellectual purposes and of\r\n    intellectual self to purposes of good, even were these merely the\r\n    small purposes of social or domestic life.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the human character in her delineation of the bad\r\nqualities, she as instinctively seeks and finds causes for the errors\r\nand evils of the minds she displays. Foolishness, and ignorance, and\r\npoverty are traced, entirely without affectation and \"cant,\" in their\r\naction as misleading influences in the lives of the poor sinners and\r\nsufferers.\r\n\r\nThe stories told in the _Illustrations_ are frequently very\r\ninteresting. In this respect, there is a notable advance in the course\r\nof the series. The earlier tales, such as _Life in the Wilds_ and\r\n_Brooke Farm_, are not to be compared, as mere stories, with even\r\nthose written later on by only eight or nine stirring eventful months,\r\nsuch as _Ireland_ and _The Loom and the Lugger_. Still better are the\r\nlatest tales. The _Illustrations of Taxation_ and _Illustrations of\r\nPoor-Laws and Paupers_ are, despite the unattractiveness of their\r\ntopics, of the highest interest. _The Parish_, _The Town_, _The\r\nJerseymen Meeting_, _The Jerseymen Parting_; and _The Scholars of\r\nArnside_, would assuredly be eagerly read by any lover of fiction\r\nalmost without consciousness that there was anything in the pages\r\nexcept a deeply interesting story.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Whately pronounced _The Parish_ the best thing she had\r\ndone. _Vanderput and Snook_, the story dealing with bills of exchange,\r\nwas the favorite with Mr. Hallam. Lord Brougham, on whose engagement\r\nshe did the five \"Poor-Law\" stories, wrote most enthusiastically that\r\nthey surpassed all the expectations that her previous works had led\r\nhim to form. Coleridge told her that he \"looked eagerly every month\"\r\nfor the new number; and Lord Durham recounted to her how one evening\r\nhe was at Kensington Palace (where the widowed Duchess of Kent was\r\nthen residing, and devoting herself to that education which has made\r\nher daughter the best sovereign of her dynasty), when the little\r\nPrincess Victoria came running from an inner room to show her mother,\r\nwith delight, the advertisement of the \"Taxation\" tales; for the young\r\nPrincess was being allowed to read the _Illustrations_, and found them\r\nher most fascinating story-books.\r\n\r\nHarriet's experiences, however, were not all quite so agreeable. Mrs.\r\nMarcet, who \"had a great opinion of great people--of people great by\r\nany distinction, ability, office, birth, and what not--and innocently\r\nsupposed her own taste to be universal,\" formed a warm and generous\r\nfriendship for Miss Martineau, and used to delight in carrying to her\r\nthe \"homages\" of the savants and the aristocratic readers of the\r\n_Illustrations_ in France, where Mrs. Marcet's acquaintance was\r\nextensive. She one day told Miss Martineau, with much delight, that\r\nLouis Philippe, the then King of the French, had ordered a copy of the\r\nseries for each member of his family, and had also requested M. Guizot\r\nto have the stories translated, and introduced into the French\r\nnational schools. This was presently confirmed by a large order from\r\nFrance for copies, and by a note from the officially-appointed\r\ntranslator requesting Harriet Martineau to favor him with some\r\nparticulars of her personal history, for introduction into a\r\nperiodical which was being issued by the Government for the promotion\r\nof education amongst the French people. The writer added that M.\r\nGuizot wished to have Miss Martineau's series specially noticed in\r\nconnection with her own personality, since she afforded the first\r\ninstance on record of a woman who was not born to sovereign station\r\naffecting practical legislation otherwise than through a man.\r\n\r\nAt the very time that she received this flattering note, Harriet was\r\nengaged in writing her twelfth number, _French Wines and Politics_.\r\nThe topic treated in this story is that of value, with the subsidiary\r\nquestions relating to prices and their fluctuations. The tale takes up\r\nthe period of the great French Revolution, and shows how the fortunes\r\nof certain wine-merchants near Bordeaux, and of the head of the Paris\r\nhouse in connection, were affected by the course of that great social\r\nconvulsion. The scene was unquestionably happily chosen. The\r\ncircumstances were abnormal, it is true; but the causes which created\r\nsuch vast fluctuations in prices, and such changes in the value of\r\ngoods, were, in fact, only the same fundamental causes as are always\r\nat the basis of such alterations in price and value; it was merely the\r\nrapidity and violence of the movement which were peculiar. The story\r\nwas well put together; and the \"Illustration\" was in every way\r\nadmirable for every possible desirable object, except only for the one\r\nof being pleasant to the ruling powers in the France of 1833.\r\n\r\nHarriet Martineau's constant sympathy with democracy, her hatred of\r\noppression and tyranny, and her aversion to class government, all\r\nbecame conspicuous in this story. \"The greatest happiness of the\r\ngreatest number\" of mankind was her ideal of the aim of legislation;\r\nand she well knew, as Bentham saw, that only the democratic form of\r\ngovernment can produce a body of laws approximating to this ideal. Her\r\nefforts were constant, therefore, to prepare the people to demand, and\r\nto afterwards wisely use, the power of governing themselves. Now,\r\nthough Louis Philippe was the citizen-king, though he was the head of\r\na republican monarchy, though his legislative chamber rejected in that\r\nsame year a ministerial document because it spoke of the people as\r\n\"subjects,\" yet it may be easily understood that this king and his\r\nministers did not care to stimulate the democratic feeling of the\r\nnation any more than they found inevitable. The whole tone of this\r\nwork would be objectionable to them; and a dozen passages might be\r\nreadily quoted to show why royal and aristocratic rulers were little\r\nlikely to aid its circulation amongst the people whom they governed.\r\nHere, for instance, is a portion of the passage on the storming of the\r\nBastile:--\r\n\r\n    The spectacles of a life-time were indeed to be beheld within the\r\n    compass of this one scene.... Here were the terrors which sooner\r\n    or later chill the marrow of despotism, and the stern joy with\r\n    which its retribution fires the heart of the patriot. Here were\r\n    the servants of tyranny quailing before the glance of the\r\n    people.... The towers of palaces might be seen afar, where princes\r\n    were quaking at this final assurance of the downfall of their\r\n    despotic sway, knowing that the assumed sanctity of royalty was\r\n    being wafted away with every puff of smoke which spread itself\r\n    over the sky, and their irresponsibility melting in fires lighted\r\n    by the hands which they had vainly attempted to fetter, and blown\r\n    by the breath which they had imagined they could stifle. They had\r\n    denied the birth of that liberty whose baptism in fire and in\r\n    blood was now being celebrated in a many-voiced chant with which\r\n    the earth should ring for centuries. Some from other lands were\r\n    already present to hear and join in it; some free Britons to aid,\r\n    some wondering slaves of other despots to slink homewards with\r\n    whispered tidings of its import; for from that day to this, the\r\n    history of the fall of the Bastile has been told as a secret in\r\n    the vineyards of Portugal, and among the groves of Spain, and in\r\n    the patriotic conclaves of the youth of Italy, while it has been\r\n    loudly and joyfully proclaimed from one end to the other of Great\r\n    Britain, till her lisping children are familiar with the tale.\r\n\r\nBesides such passages as this, scarcely likely to please the French\r\nking, there was the special ground for his objection that his\r\nimmediate ancestor, Egalite, was introduced into the story, and\r\ndepicted in no favorable light his efforts to inflame the popular\r\nviolence for his selfish ends, his hypocrisy, his cowardice, and so\r\non, being held up to contempt. Mrs. Marcet, when she read all this,\r\ncame breathless to Harriet Martineau to ask her how she could have\r\nmade such a blunder as to write a story that plainly would (and, of\r\ncourse, in fact, did) put an end to the official patronage of her\r\nseries in France, and would destroy for ever any hopes that she might\r\nhave entertained of being received at the Court of Louis Philippe?\r\nGreatly surprised was the good lady at finding Harriet's reverence for\r\nthat monarch so limited in extent. She replied to her kind friend that\r\nshe \"wrote with a view to the people, and especially the most\r\nsuffering of them; and the crowned heads must for once take their\r\nchance for their feelings.\"\r\n\r\nAt the very moment that Mrs. Marcet's remonstrance was made, Miss\r\nMartineau was writing a story of a character likely to be even more\r\ndistasteful to the Emperor of Russia than this one to the King of the\r\nFrench. She had found it difficult to illustrate the theory of the\r\ncurrency in a story treating of the existence of civilized people. The\r\nonly situation in which she could find persons, above the rank of\r\nsavages, transacting their exchanges by aid of a kind of money which\r\nmade the business only one remove from bartering, was amongst the\r\nPolish exiles in Siberia. She therefore wrote _The Charmed Sea_, a\r\nstory founded upon the terrible facts of the lives of the exiled Poles\r\n\"in the depths of Eastern Siberia,\" working in \"a silver-mine near the\r\nwestern extremity of the Daourian Range, and within hearing of the\r\nwaters of the Baikal when its storms were fiercest.\" Had the\r\nmelancholy tale been written in the service of the Poles, it could not\r\nhave been more moving. So powerful, and interesting was it, indeed,\r\nthat the criticism of the _Edinburgh Review_ was that the fiction too\r\nentirely overpowered the political economy. The arrival of _The\r\nCharmed Sea_ in Russia changed the favorable opinion which the Czar\r\nhad previously been so kind as to express about the _Illustrations_.\r\nHe had been purchasing largely of the French translation of the series\r\nfor distribution amongst his people. But now he issued a proclamation\r\nordering every copy in Russia of every number to be immediately burnt,\r\nand forbidding the author ever to set foot upon his soil. Austria,\r\nequally concerned in the Polish business, followed this example, and a\r\ndescription of Harriet Martineau's person was hung in the appointed\r\nplaces, amidst the lists of the proscribed, all over Russia, Austria,\r\nand Austrian-Italy. Despots, at least, had no admiration for her\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nThe only important adverse criticism in the press appeared in the\r\n_Quarterly Review_.[7] The reviewer objected impartially to every\r\none of the twelve stories which had then appeared. Every circumstance\r\nwhich could arouse prejudice against the series was taken advantage\r\nof, from party political feeling and religious bigotry, down to the\r\nweakness of fluid philanthropy, and \"the prudery and timidity of the\r\nmiddle-classes of England.\" The principal ground of attack was the\r\nstory which dealt with Malthusianism, _Weal and Woe in Garveloch_.\r\n\r\n          [7] In the same number, by the way, appeared the notorious\r\n          biting and sarcastic notice of Tennyson's second volume. It\r\n          is a distinction, indeed, for a critical review, that one\r\n          number should have devoted half its space to violently\r\n          unfavorable criticisms of Alfred Tennyson's poetry and\r\n          Harriet Martineau's political economy.\r\n\r\n    When the course of my exposition brought me to the population\r\n    subject, I, with my youthful and provincial mode of thought and\r\n    feeling--brought up, too, amidst the prudery which is found in its\r\n    great force in our middle class--could not but be sensible that I\r\n    risked much in writing and publishing on a subject which was not\r\n    universally treated in the pure, benevolent, and scientific spirit\r\n    of Malthus himself.... I said nothing to anybody; and, when the\r\n    number was finished, I read it aloud to my mother and aunt. If\r\n    there had been any opening whatever for doubt or dread, I was sure\r\n    that these two ladies would have given me abundant warning and\r\n    exhortation--both from their very keen sense of propriety and\r\n    their anxious affection for me. But they were as complacent and\r\n    easy as they had been interested and attentive. I saw that all\r\n    ought to be safe.\r\n\r\nThe _Quarterly Review_ seized the opportunity of the appearance\r\nof this number to make a vile attack upon the series and its writer.\r\nHarriet suffered under it to a degree which seems almost excessive.\r\nThe review is so obviously full of fallacies, as regards its Political\r\nEconomy, that any person whose opinion was worth having could hardly\r\nhesitate in deciding that she, and not her critic, was talking\r\ncommon-sense and arguing logically. As to the personal part of the\r\narticle, it is, though scurrilous, and even indecent, so very funny\r\nthat the attacked might almost have forgotten the insult in the\r\namusement. Nevertheless, the writers, Croker and Lockhart, did their\r\nworst. Croker openly said that he expected to lose his pension very\r\nshortly, and, being wishful to make himself a literary position before\r\nthat event happened, he had begun by \"tomahawking Miss Martineau.\" All\r\nthat could be painful to her as a woman, and injurious to her as a\r\nwriter, was said, or attempted to be conveyed, in this article.\r\n\r\nLet us see what it was all about. Garveloch, one of the Hebridean\r\nislands, is seen in the \"Illustration\" rapidly multiplying its\r\npopulation, both by early marriages and by immigration, under the\r\nstimulus of a passing prosperity in the fishing industry. The influx\r\nof capital and the increase of the demand for food, have led to such\r\nan improvement in the cultivation of the land, that the food produce\r\nof the island has been doubled in ten years. Ella, the heroine (a\r\nfine, strong, self-contained, helpful woman--one of the noblest female\r\ncharacters in these works), foresees that if the reckless increase of\r\npopulation continues, the supply of food will by-and-by run short. Her\r\ninterlocutor asks how this will be the case, since the population will\r\nsurely not double again, as it has done already, in ten years? Then\r\nthe _Quarterly_ quotes Ella's reply, and comments on it:--\r\n\r\n    \"Certainly not; but say twenty, thirty, fifty or any number of\r\n    years you choose; still, as the number of the people doubles\r\n    itself for ever, while the produce of the land does not, the\r\n    people must increase faster than the produce.\"\r\n\r\n    This is rare logic and arithmetic, and not a little curious as\r\n    natural history. A plain person now would have supposed that if\r\n    the produce doubled itself in ten, and the people only in a\r\n    hundred years, the people would not increase _quite_ so fast\r\n    as the produce, seeing that at the end of the first century the\r\n    population would be multiplied but by two, the produce by one\r\n    thousand and twenty-four. But these are the discoveries of genius!\r\n    Why does Miss Martineau write, except to correct our mistaken\r\n    notions and to expound to us the mysteries of \"the principle of\r\n    population.\"\r\n\r\nThe reviewer goes on to suggest, in the broadest language, that she\r\nhas confounded the rate of the multiplication of the herring-fisher-women\r\n with that of the herrings themselves; reproves her for writing on\r\n \"these ticklish topics\" with so little physiological information; and\r\n tells her that she, \"poor innocent, has been puzzling over Mr.\r\n Malthus's arithmetical and geometrical ratios for knowledge which she\r\n should have obtained by a simple question or two of her mamma.\" In\r\n one and the same paragraph, he tells her that he is \"loth to bring a\r\n blush unnecessarily upon the cheek of any woman,\" and asks her if she\r\n picked up her information on the subject \"in her conferences with the\r\n Lord Chancellor?\"\r\n\r\nThis is enough to show to what a sensitive young lady was exposed in\r\nillustrating \"a principle as undeniable as the multiplication table,\"\r\nand in stating the facts upon which hangs the explanation of the\r\npoverty, and therefore of a large part of the vice and misery, of\r\nmankind. Miss Martineau's exposition was, of course, entirely right,\r\nand the fallacy in the review is obvious, one would suppose on the\r\nsurface. The reviewer's error consists in his assumption--the falsity\r\nof which is at once apparent on the face of the statement--that land\r\ncan go on doubling its produce _every_ ten years, for an indefinite\r\nperiod. So far from this being true, the fact is that the limit of\r\nimproving the cultivation of land is soon reached.\r\n\r\nBetter agricultural treatment may easily make half-cultivated land\r\nbring forth double its previous produce; but the highest pitch of\r\nfarming once reached--as it comparatively soon is--the produce cannot\r\nbe further increased; and even before this limit is reached, the\r\nreturn for each additional application of capital and labor becomes\r\nless and less proportionately bountiful. This is the truth known to\r\npolitical economists as \"the Law of the Diminishing Return of Land.\"\r\nTaken in conjunction with the fact that the human race _can_ double\r\nfor ever, theoretically, and in reality _does_ multiply its numbers\r\nwith each generation, checked only by the forethought of the more\r\nprudent and the operations of famine, war, crime, and the diseases\r\ncaused by poverty, this law explains why mankind does not more rapidly\r\nimprove its condition--why the poor have been always with us--and why\r\nteaching such as Harriet Martineau here gave must be received into the\r\npopular mind before the condition of society can be expected to be\r\nimproved in the only way possible, by the wisdom and prudence of its\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nPainful as was the attack she had undergone, intensely as she had\r\nsuffered from its character and nature, Miss Martineau did not allow\r\nwhat she had felt of personal distress to have any influence on her\r\nfuture writings. Her moral courage had been well trained and\r\nexercised, first by the efforts that her mind had had to make in\r\nfollowing her conscience as a guide to the formation of opinions, in\r\nopposition to the tendency implanted by her mother's treatment to bow\r\nsupinely before authority; secondly, by the lesson of endurance which\r\nher deafness had brought to her. She had now to show, for the first,\r\nbut by no means the last time, that hers was one of those temperaments\r\nwhich belong to all leaders of men, whether in physical or moral\r\nwarfare; that danger was to her a stimulus, and that her courage rose\r\nthe higher the greater the demand for its exercise.\r\n\r\nPraise and blame, appreciation and defamation, strengthened and\r\nenlarged her mind during this period. But at the end of it, Sydney\r\nSmith could say: \"She has gone through such a season as no girl before\r\never knew, and she has kept her own mind, her own manners, and her own\r\nvoice. She's safe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nFIVE ACTIVE YEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the conclusion of the publication of the _Illustrations of\r\nPolitical Economy_, Harriet went to the United States, and travelled\r\nthere for more than two years. Her fame had preceded her; and she\r\nreceived the warm and gracious greeting from the generous people of\r\nAmerica that they are ever ready to give to distinguished guests from\r\ntheir \"little Mother-isle.\" She travelled not only in the Northern\r\nStates, but in the South and the West too, going in the one direction\r\nfrom New York to New Orleans, and in the other to Chicago and\r\nMichigan. Everywhere she was received with eager hospitality. Public\r\ninstitutions were freely thrown open to her, and eminent citizens vied\r\nwith each other in showing her attention, publicly and privately.\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy incident in the course of the whole two years was\r\nher public declaration of her anti-slavery principles. The\r\nAnti-Slavery movement was in its beginning. The abolitionists were the\r\nsubjects of abuse and social persecution, and Miss Martineau was\r\nquickly made aware that by a declaration in their favor she would risk\r\nincurring odium, and might change her popularity in society into\r\ndisrepute and avoidance. It would have been perfectly easy for a less\r\nactive conscience and a less true moral sense to have evaded the\r\nquestion, in such a manner that neither party could have upbraided her\r\nfor her action. She might simply have said that she was there as a\r\nlearner, not as a teacher; that her business was to survey American\r\nsociety, and not to take any share in its party disputes, or to give\r\nany opinion on the political questions of a strange land. Such\r\npaltering with principle was impossible to Harriet Martineau. She did\r\nnot obtrude her utterances on the subject, but when asked in private\r\nsociety what she thought, she frankly spoke out her utter abhorrence,\r\nnot merely of slavery in the abstract, but also of the state of the\r\nSouthern slave-holders and their human property. She could not help\r\nseeing that this candor often gave offense; but that was not her\r\nbusiness when her opinion was sought on a moral question.\r\n\r\nThe really searching test of her personal character did not come,\r\nhowever, with regard to this matter, till she went to stay for a while\r\nin Boston, the head-quarters of the abolitionists, fifteen months\r\nafter her arrival in America. It happened that she reached Boston the\r\nvery day a ladies' anti-slavery meeting was broken up by the violence\r\nof a mob, and that Garrison, falling into the hands of the enraged\r\nmultitude, was half-murdered in the street. Harriet had given a\r\npromise, long previously, to attend an abolitionists' meeting; and\r\nthough these occurrences showed her that there was actual personal\r\ndanger in keeping her word, she was not to be intimidated. She went to\r\nthe very next meeting of the ladies' society, which was held a month\r\nafter the one so violently disturbed, and there, being unexpectedly\r\nbegged to \"give them the comfort\" of a few words from her, she rose,\r\nand as the official report says, \"with great dignity and simplicity of\r\nmanner,\" declared her full sympathy with the principles of the\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\nShe knew well how grave would be the social consequences to her of\r\nthus throwing in her lot with the despised and insulted abolitionists;\r\nbut she felt that \"she never could be happy again\" if she shrunk from\r\nthe duty of expression thrust upon her. The results to her were as\r\nserious as she had apprehended. She received innumerable personal\r\ninsults and slights, public and private, where before all had been\r\nhomage; the Southern newspapers threatened her personal safety,\r\ncalling her a foreign \"incendiary;\" and, to crown all, she had to give\r\nup an intended Ohio tour, on the information of an eminent Cincinnati\r\nmerchant that he had heard with his own ears the details of a plot to\r\nhang her on the wharf at Louisville, before the respectable\r\ninhabitants could intervene, in order to \"warn all other meddlesome\r\nforeigners.\"\r\n\r\nAll this abuse and insult and threatening from the lower kind of\r\npersons, interested for their purses, had, of course, no influence\r\nupon the hundred private friendships that she had formed. Ardent and\r\ndeep was the affection with which many Americans came to regard her,\r\nand with some of them her intimate friendship lasted through all the\r\nsucceeding forty years of her life. Emerson was one of these friends,\r\nand Garrison another. It was her frequent correspondence with these\r\nand many others that kept her interest in the affairs of the United\r\nStates so active, and made her so well-informed about them as to give\r\nher the great authority that she had, both in England and America,\r\nduring the life and death struggle of the Union, so that at that time,\r\nwhen she was writing leaders for the London _Daily News_, Mr. W.\r\nE. Forster said that \"it was Harriet Martineau alone who was keeping\r\nEnglish public opinion about America on the right side through the\r\npress.\"\r\n\r\nLoath to leave such friendships behind, and yet longing for home, she\r\nsailed from New York at the end of July, 1836, and reached Liverpool\r\non the 26th August. A parting act of American chivalry was that her\r\nship-passage was paid for her by some unknown friend.\r\n\r\nIt was while she was in the United States that the first portrait of\r\nher which I have seen was painted. She herself did not like it,\r\ncalling the attitude melodramatic; but her sister Rachel, I am told,\r\nalways declared that it was the only true portrait of Harriet that was\r\never taken. At this point, then, some idea of her person may be given.\r\n\r\nShe was somewhat above the middle height, and at this time had a\r\nslender figure. The face in the portrait is oval; the forehead rather\r\nbroad, as well as high, but not either to a remarkable degree. The\r\nmost noticeable peculiarity of the face is found in a slight\r\nprojection of the under lip. The nose is straight, not at all turned\r\nup at the end, but yet with a definite tip to it. The eyes are a clear\r\ngray, with a calm, steadfast, yet sweet gaze; indeed there is an\r\nalmost appealing look in them. The hair is of so dark a brown as to\r\nappear nearly black. A tress of it (cut off twenty years later than\r\nthis American visit, when it had turned snow-white) has been given\r\nto me; and I find the treasured relic to be of exceptionally fine\r\ntexture--a sure sign of a delicate and sensitive nervous organization.\r\nHer hands and feet were small.\r\n\r\nShe was certainly not beautiful; besides the slight projection of the\r\nlower lip the face has the defect of the cheeks sloping in too much\r\ntowards the chin. But she was not strikingly plain either. The\r\ncountenance in this picture has a look both of appealing sweetness\r\nand of strength in reserve; and one feels that with such beauty of\r\nexpression it could not fail to be attractive to those who looked upon\r\nit with sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe competition amongst the publishers for Miss Martineau's book on\r\nAmerica was an amusing contrast to the scorn with which her proposals\r\nfor her _Political Economy_ had been received. Murray sent a message\r\nthrough a friend, offering to undertake the American work; and letters\r\nfrom two other publishers were awaiting her arrival in England. On the\r\nday that the newspapers announced that she had reached town no fewer\r\nthan three of the chief London publishers called upon her with\r\nproposals. She declined those of Bentley and Colburn, and accepted the\r\noffer of Messrs. Saunders and Otley to pay her L300 per volume for the\r\nfirst edition of three thousand copies. The book appeared in three\r\nvolumes, so that she received L900 for it. She completed the three\r\ngoodly volumes in six months.\r\n\r\nShe had wished to call the book _Theory and Practice of Society in\r\nAmerica_, a title which would have exactly expressed the position that\r\nshe took up in it, viz., that the Americans should be judged by the\r\ndegree in which they approached, in their daily lives, to the standard\r\nof the principles laid down in their Constitution. Her publishers so\r\nstrongly objected to this title, that she consented to call the work\r\nsimply _Society in America_. She held to her scheme none the less, and\r\nthe book proceeds upon it. She quotes the Declaration of Independence\r\nthat all men are created equal, with an inalienable right to life,\r\nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and that Governments derive\r\ntheir just powers from the consent of the governed. \"Every true\r\ncitizen,\" she claims, \"must necessarily be content to have his\r\nself-government tried by the test of the principles to which, by his\r\ncitizenship, he has become a subscriber.\" She brings social life in\r\nthe United States of 1834-6 to this test accordingly.\r\n\r\nThat method of approaching her subject had some advantages. It enabled\r\nher to treat with peculiar force the topics of slavery, of the\r\nexclusion of women from political affairs, and of the subservience to\r\nthe despotism of public opinion which she found to exist at that time\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nBut she herself came to see, in after times, that her _plan_ (leaving\r\nthe details aside) was radically faulty. She was, as she says, \"at the\r\nmost metaphysical period\" of her mental history. Thus, she failed at\r\nthe moment to perceive that she commenced her subject _at the wrong\r\nend_ in taking a theory and judging the facts of American society by\r\ntheir agreement or disagreement with that _a priori_ philosophy. It\r\nwas the theory that had to be judged by the way in which the people\r\nlived under a government framed upon it, and not the people by the\r\ndegree in which they live up to the theory. The English public wanted\r\na book that would help them to know the American public and its ways;\r\nthe Americans required to see through the eyes of an observant,\r\ncultivated foreigner, what they were being and doing. It is this which\r\na traveller has to do--to observe _facts_: to draw lessons from them,\r\nif he will, but not to consider the facts in their relationship to a\r\npre-conceived theory. Human experience is perennially important and\r\neternally interesting; and this is what a traveller has to note and\r\nrecord. Political philosophies must be gathered from experience\r\ninstead of (what she attempted) the real life being viewed only as\r\nrelated to the philosophy. In fine, her error was in treating\r\nabstractedly what was necessarily a concrete theme.\r\n\r\nWith this objection to the scheme of the book, all criticism may end.\r\nAll criticism did not end (any more than it began) in this way in\r\n1837. Speaking out so boldly as she did on a variety of the most\r\nimportant social topics, she naturally aroused opposition, which the\r\npower and eloquence of the style did not mitigate.\r\n\r\nThe anti-slavery tone of the book alone would have ensured violent\r\nattacks upon it and its author, as, after her ostracism because of her\r\nanti-slavery declaration, she well knew would be the case. \"This\r\nsubject haunts us on every page,\" distressfully wrote Margaret Fuller;\r\nand greatly exaggerated though this statement was, it certainly is\r\ntrue that there is hardly a chapter in which the reader is allowed to\r\nforget that the curse of humanity made merchandise, shadowed life,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, throughout the whole United States. Neither by\r\nthe holders of slaves in the South, nor by their accessories in the\r\nNorth, was it possible that she could be regarded otherwise than as an\r\nenemy, the more powerful, and therefore the more to be hated and\r\nabused, because of her standing and her ability. In estimating the\r\ncourage and disinterestedness which she displayed in so decisively\r\nbearing her witness against the state of American society under the\r\nslave system, it must be remembered not only that she had many valued\r\npersonal friends in the South, and amongst the anti-abolitionists of\r\nthe North, but also that she knew that she was closing against herself\r\na wide avenue for the dissemination of her opinions upon any subject\r\nwhatsoever. No book written by an abolitionist would be admitted into\r\nany one of thousands of American homes. The abolitionists reprinted\r\nportions of _Society of America_, as a pamphlet, and distributed\r\nit broadcast. The result was that, up to the time when slavery was\r\nabolished Harriet Martineau was continually held up to scorn and\r\nreprobation in Southern newspapers, \"in the good company of Mrs.\r\nChapman and Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe.\"\r\n\r\nEven greater courage was displayed by Harriet Martineau in her\r\nboldness of utterance upon some other points, about which freedom of\r\nthought was as obnoxious in England as in America. When she maintained\r\nthat divorce should be permissible by mutual consent, provided only\r\nthat the interests of children and the distribution of property were\r\nequitably arranged for; when she pleaded for the emancipation of\r\nwomen; or when she devoted a chapter to showing the evils which spring\r\nfrom the accumulation of enormous fortunes, and incidentally attacked\r\nthe laws and customs of primogeniture, of the transfer of land, and\r\nthe like, which are devised specially to facilitate and encourage such\r\naccumulations: in these and other passages of an equally radical\r\nnature, she braved a large body of opinion in English society, as\r\nwell as in the other country for which she wrote. She mentions\r\nsubsequently, that for many years she was occasionally startled by\r\nfinding herself regarded in various quarters as a free-thinker upon\r\ndangerous subjects, and as something of a demagogue. I have little\r\ndoubt that the \"advanced\" political philosophy of _Society in America_\r\ndid originate such suspicions in minds of the Conservative order, \"the\r\ntimid party,\" as she described them in this same book. Yet she adds:\r\n\r\n    I have never regretted its boldness of speech. I felt a relief in\r\n    having opened my mind which I would at no time have exchanged for\r\n    any gain of reputation or fortune. The time had come when, having\r\n    experienced what might be called the extremes of obscurity and\r\n    difficulty first, and influence and success afterwards, I could\r\n    pronounce that there was nothing for which it was worth\r\n    sacrificing freedom of thought and speech.\r\n\r\nThere was but little in _Society in America_ of the ordinary book of\r\ntravels. As an account of the political condition and the social\r\narrangements of the American people it was of singular value. But\r\nthe personal incidents of travel, the descriptions of scenery, the\r\nreminiscences of eminent persons, of all which Harriet Martineau\r\nhad gathered a store, were entirely omitted from this work. Messrs.\r\nSaunders and Otley suggested to her that she should make a second\r\nbook out of this kind of material. She consented; and wrote her\r\n_Retrospect of Western Travel_. She completed the manuscript of this\r\nin December, 1837, and it was published soon afterwards in three\r\nvolumes. The publishers gave her six hundred pounds for it.\r\n\r\nThe fifteen hundred pounds which she thus earned exceeded in amount\r\nthe whole of what she had then received for her _Illustrations of\r\nPolitical Economy_. The last-named great work was nearly all published\r\nupon the absurdly unequal terms which Charles Fox had secured from her\r\nin the beginning. It was characteristic of her generosity in pecuniary\r\nmatters and her loyalty to her friends, that although her agreement\r\nwith Fox was dissoluble at the end of every five numbers, she\r\nnevertheless allowed it to hold good, and permitted him to pocket a\r\nvery leonine share of her earnings throughout the whole publication of\r\nthe original series, only claiming a revision of the terms when she\r\ncommenced afresh, as it were, with the \"Poor-Law,\" and \"Taxation\"\r\ntales. Thus the immense popularity of the _Illustrations_ had not\r\ngreatly enriched her. A portion of her earnings by them was invested\r\nin her American tour; and now that she received this return from her\r\nbooks of travels she felt it her duty to make a provision for the\r\nfuture. She purchased a deferred annuity of one hundred pounds to\r\nbegin in April, 1850. It displayed a characteristic calm confidence in\r\nherself that she should thus have entirely locked up her earnings for\r\ntwelve years. She clearly felt a quiet assurance that her brain and\r\nher hand would serve to maintain her, at least as long as she was in\r\nthe flower of her age.\r\n\r\nThe six volumes about America were not the whole of her work during\r\nthe first eighteen months after her return to England. She wrote an\r\narticle on Miss Sedgwick's works for the _Westminster Review_, and\r\nseveral other short papers for various magazines. The extraordinary\r\nindustry with which she returned to labor after her long rest requires\r\nno comment.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1838 she wrote a work called _How to Observe in Morals\r\nand Manners_. It forms a crown octavo volume of two hundred and\r\nthirty-eight pages, and was published by Mr. Charles Knight. The book\r\nis an interesting one, both for the reflections which it contains upon\r\nthe subject of its title, and as indicating the method which she had\r\nherself pursued in her study of the morals and manners of the country\r\nin which she had been travelling. There is certainly no failure in the\r\ncourage with which she expresses her convictions. She admits elsewhere\r\nthat the abuse which she received from America had so acted upon her\r\nmind that she had come to quail at the sight of letters addressed in a\r\nstrange handwriting, or of newspapers sent from the United States. But\r\nthere is no trace in this her next considerable work of any tendency\r\nto follow rather than to lead the public opinion of her time. One\r\nparagraph only may be quoted to indicate this fact:\r\n\r\n    Persecution for opinion is always going on. It can be inflicted\r\n    out of the province of Law as well as through it.... Whatever a\r\n    nation may tell him of its love of liberty should go for little if\r\n    he sees a virtuous man's children taken from him on the ground of\r\n    his holding an unusual religious belief; or citizens mobbed for\r\n    asserting the rights of negroes; or moralists treated with public\r\n    scorn for carrying out allowed principles to their ultimate\r\n    issues; or scholars oppressed for throwing new light on the sacred\r\n    text; or philosophers denounced for bringing fresh facts to the\r\n    surface of human knowledge, whether they seem to agree or not with\r\n    long established suppositions.[8]\r\n\r\n          [8] _How to Observe_, p. 204.\r\n\r\nThe next piece of work that Harriet did in this spring of 1838 was of\r\na very different order. The Poor-Law Commissioners were desirous of\r\nissuing a series of \"Guides to Service,\" and application was made to\r\nMiss Martineau to write some of these little books. She undertook\r\n_The Maid of All Work_, _The Housemaid_, _The Lady's Maid_ and _The\r\nDress-maker_. These were issued without her name on the title-page,\r\nbut the authorship was an open secret.\r\n\r\nShe was a thoroughly good housekeeper herself. Her conscience went\r\ninto this, as into all her other business. \"Housewifery is supposed to\r\ntransact itself,\" she wrote; \"but in reality it requires all the\r\nfaculties which can be brought to bear upon it, and all the good moral\r\nhabits which conscience can originate.\" It was in this spirit that\r\nshe wrote instructions for servants. The fine moral tone invariably\r\ndiscoverable in her works, is as delightful here as elsewhere. But\r\nthe little \"Guides to Service,\" contain also the most precise and\r\npractical directions for the doing of the household duties and the\r\nneedlework which fall to the hands of the classes of servants for whom\r\nshe wrote. Practical hints are given from which the majority of these\r\nclasses of women-workers might learn much, for _brains tell_ in the\r\nmean and dirty scrubbery of life as well as in pleasanter things, and\r\nscience is to be applied to common domestic duties as to bigger\r\nundertakings. The heart and mind of Harriet Martineau were equal to\r\nteaching upon matters such as these, as well as to studying the deeper\r\nrelations of mankind in political economy, or the state of society in\r\na foreign land. Her great power of sympathy enabled her to enter fully\r\ninto every human position. So well was the maid-of-all-work's station\r\ndescribed, and her duties indicated, and her trials pointed out, and\r\nhow she might solace herself under those troubles discovered, and the\r\nway in which her work should be set about detailed, that the rumor\r\nspread pretty widely that Harriet had once occupied such a situation\r\nherself. She regarded this mistake with complacency, as a tribute to\r\nthe practical character of her little work.\r\n\r\nAs a fact, she was herself a capable housewife. Her housekeeping was\r\nalways well done. Her own hands, indeed, as well as her head, were\r\nemployed in it on occasion. When in her home, she daily filled her\r\nlamp herself. She dusted her own books, too, invariably. Sometimes she\r\ndid more. Soon after her establishment at the Lakes (an event which we\r\nhave not yet reached, but the anecdote is in place here), a lady who\r\ngreatly reverenced her for her writings called upon her in her new\r\nhome, accompanied by a gentleman friend. As the visitors approached\r\nthe house by the carriage-drive, they saw someone perched on a set of\r\nkitchen steps, cleaning the drawing-room windows. It was the famous\r\nauthoress herself! She calmly went for her trumpet, to listen to their\r\nbusiness; and when they had introduced themselves, she asked them in,\r\nand entered into an interesting conversation on various literary\r\ntopics. Before they left, she explained, with evident amusement at\r\nhaving been caught at her housemaid's duties, that the workmen had\r\nbeen long about the house; that this morning, when the dirty windows\r\nmight for the first time be cleaned, one of her servants had gone off\r\nto marry a carpenter, and the other to see the ceremony; and so the\r\nmistress, tired of the dirt, had set to work to wash and polish her\r\nwindow for herself.\r\n\r\nAn article on \"Domestic Service,\" for the _Westminster Review_, was\r\nwritten easily, while her mind was so full of the subject, in the\r\nbeginning of June, 1838. But a great enterprise was before her--a\r\nnovel; and at length she settled down to this, beginning it on her\r\nthirty-sixth birthday, June 12th, 1838. The writing of this new book\r\nwas interrupted by a tour in Scotland during August and September, and\r\nby writing a remarkable and eloquent article on slavery, \"The Martyr\r\nAge of the United States,\" which occupies' fifty-five pages of the\r\n_Westminster Review_ in the January, 1839, number of that publication.\r\nThe novel got finished, however, in February of this latter year; and\r\nit was published by Easter under the title of _Deerbrook_.\r\n\r\nGreat expectations had been entertained by the literary public of\r\nHarriet Martineau's first novel. The excellences of her _Illustrations_\r\nas works of fiction had been so marked and so many, that it was\r\nanticipated that she might write a novel of the highest order when\r\nreleased from the trammels under which she wrote those tales. To most\r\nof those who had expected so much _Deerbrook_ was a complete\r\ndisappointment. I believe I may justly say that it is the weakest of\r\nall Harriet Martineau's writings. It is, indeed, far superior in all\r\nrespects to nine hundred out of every thousand novels published. But\r\nshe is not judged by averages. A far higher standard of literary art\r\nis that to which we expect Harriet Martineau's writings to conform.\r\n\r\nThe book is deficient in story. Deerbrook is a country village, where\r\ntwo sisters from Birmingham, Hester and Margaret Ibbotson, take up\r\ntheir temporary abode. Mr. Hope, the village surgeon, falls in love\r\nwith Margaret; but being told that Hester loves him, while Margaret is\r\nattached to Philip Enderby, Hope decides to propose to Hester; is\r\naccepted, married to the sister he does not love, and sets up\r\nhousekeeping with the sister with whom he is in love as an inmate of\r\nhis home. The wife, moreover, is of a jealous, exacting disposition,\r\never on the watch for some token of neglect of her feelings by her\r\nfriends, anxious, irritable, and hyper-sensitive.\r\n\r\nHere is a situation which, the characters being what they are\r\ndescribed to be, could in real life eventuate only in either violent\r\ntragedy or long, slow heart-break. A woman of ultra-sensitive and\r\nrefined feelings could not live with a husband and a sister under such\r\ncircumstances without discovering the truth. A man of active\r\ntemperament and warm emotions, who declares to himself on the night of\r\nhis return from his wedding tour that his marriage \"has been a\r\nmistake, that he has desecrated his own home, and doomed to withering\r\nthe best affections of his nature,\"--such a man, with the woman he\r\nreally loves living in his home, beside the unloved wife, could not\r\ncompletely conceal his state of mind from everybody, and presently\r\nfind that after all he likes the one he has married best. Yet in the\r\nimpossible manner just indicated do all things end in _Deerbrook_. The\r\ninterest of the book is then suddenly shifted to Margaret and Enderby.\r\nHope and Hester become mere accessories. But the plot does not\r\nimprove. The Deerbrook people, hitherto adorers of their doctor,\r\nsuddenly take to throwing stones at him, and to mobbing his house,\r\nbecause he votes for the Parliamentary candidate opposed by the great\r\nman of the village, and because they take it into their heads (not a\r\nparticle of reason why they do so being shown,) that he anatomizes\r\nbodies from the graveyard. We are invited to believe that though his\r\npractice had been singularly successful, all his patients deserted\r\nhim; and notwithstanding that Hester and Margaret had each seventy\r\npounds a year of private income, the household was thus reduced to\r\nsuch distress that they could not afford gloves, and had to part with\r\nall their servants, and dined as a rule off potatoes and bread and\r\nbutter! Then Margaret's lover, Enderby, hears that she and Hope loved\r\neach other before Hope married; and though he does not for a moment\r\nsuspect anything wrong in the present, and though he passionately\r\nloves Margaret, this supposed discovery that he is not her first love\r\ncauses him to peremptorily and without explanation break off the\r\nengagement. Presently, however, an epidemic comes and restores\r\nconfidence in Mr. Hope; and Enderby's sister, who had given him the\r\ninformation on which he acted, confesses that she had exaggerated the\r\nfacts and invented part of her story; and so it all ends, and they\r\nlive happily ever after!\r\n\r\nFeeble and untrue as are plot and characters in this \"poor novel\" (as\r\nCarlyle without injustice called it), yet many scenes are well\r\nwritten, the details are truly colored, and every page is illuminated\r\nwith thought of so high an order and language so brilliant, so\r\nflowing, so felicitous, that one forgives, for the sake of merits such\r\nas these, the failure of the fiction to be either true or interesting.\r\nThis seemed to show, nevertheless, that Harriet could write essays,\r\nand travels, and didactic and philosophical works, but could not write\r\na novel except \"with a purpose,\" when the accomplishment of the\r\npurpose might excuse any other shortcomings. But when one considers\r\nthe great excellence of many of the _Illustrations_, the decided\r\ndrawing of the characters, the truthful analysis of the springs of\r\nhuman action, the manner in which the incidents are combined and\r\narranged to develop and display dispositions and histories, it becomes\r\nclear that she _had_ great powers as an imaginative depicter of human\r\nnature and social life, and that there must have been other causes\r\nthan sheer incapacity for the faults and the feebleness of\r\n_Deerbrook_.\r\n\r\nThe first cause was what seems to me a mistaken theory about plots in\r\nfiction, which she had adopted since writing the _Illustrations_. She\r\nnow fancied that a perfect plot must be taken from life, forgetting\r\nthat we none of us know the whole plot of the existence of any other\r\ncreature than ourselves, and that the psychological insight of the\r\ngifted novelist is displayed in arguing from what is known to what is\r\nunknown, and in combining the primary elements of human character into\r\ntheir necessary consequences in act and feeling. This error she would\r\nhave been cured from by experience had she gone on writing fiction.\r\nShe might have been aided in this by what she naively enough avows\r\nabout _Deerbrook_: that she supposed that she took the story of Hope's\r\nmarriage from the history of a friend of her family, and that she\r\nafterwards found out that nothing of the sort had really happened to\r\nhim! She might then have asked herself whether the story as she had\r\ntold it was more possible than it was possible that gunpowder should\r\nbe put to flame without an explosion. A girl in her teens might have\r\nbeen forgiven for playing with the history of the wildest passions of\r\nthe human heart; but Harriet Martineau erred because she tried to\r\nenslave herself to fact in a matter in which she should have inferred,\r\njudged from psychological principles, and trusted to the intuitions of\r\nher own mind for the final working out of her problem. As it was, if\r\nher \"fact\" had been a reality we should have been compelled to account\r\nfor the placid progress of events by the supposition that she had\r\nutterly misrepresented the characters of the persons involved.\r\n\r\nThis bondage to (supposed) fact was one cause of her failure. A\r\nlesser, but still important reason for it, was that she tried to\r\nimitate Jane Austen's style. Her admiration of the works of this\r\nmistress of the art of depicting human nature was very great.\r\nHarriet's diary of the period when she was preparing to write\r\n_Deerbrook_, shows that she re-read Miss Austen's novels, and found\r\nthem \"wonderfully beautiful.\" This judgment she annexed to _Emma_;\r\nand again, after recording her new reading of _Pride and Prejudice_,\r\nshe added, \"I think it as clever as before; but Miss Austen seems\r\nwonderfully afraid of pathos. I long to try.\" When she did \"try,\" she,\r\neither intentionally or unconsciously, but very decidedly, modelled\r\nher style on Miss Austen's. But the two women were essentially\r\ndifferent. Harriet Martineau had an original mind; she did wrong, and\r\nprepared the retribution of failure for herself, in imitating at all;\r\nand Jane Austen was one of the last persons she should have imitated.\r\n\r\nThe principal reasons for the inferiority of _Deerbrook_, however, are\r\nfound in her personal history. Three months after its publication, she\r\nwas utterly prostrated by an illness which had undoubtedly been slowly\r\ngrowing upon her for long before. Thus, she wrote her novel under the\r\ndepression and failure of strength caused by this malady. The illness\r\nitself was partly the result of what further tended to make her work\r\npoor in quality--the domestic anxieties, miseries and heart-burnings\r\nof that period.\r\n\r\nThe three anxious members of her family were at this time upon her\r\nhands. That brother who had succeeded to the father's business, and in\r\nwhose charge it had failed, was at this time in London. Before the\r\nweaving business stopped, Henry Martineau was engaged; but the girl\r\nbroke off the affair in consequence of the downfall of his pecuniary\r\nprospects. Henry then undertook a wine-merchant's business, and\r\nwretched with the mortification of his double failure in purse and in\r\nheart, he yielded to the temptations of his new employment, and became\r\nintemperate. During the time that _Deerbrook_ was being written, he\r\nwas living with his mother and sister in London. At the same time\r\nMrs. Martineau, now nearing seventy years old, was becoming blind.\r\nThe natural irritability of her temper was thus increased. The\r\nheart-wearing trials of a home with two such inmates were made greater\r\nto Harriet by the fact that an aged aunt also lived with them, who,\r\nbesides the many cares exacted for the well-being of age, added to\r\nHarriet's troubles by the necessity of shielding her from the tempers\r\nand depressions of the other two.\r\n\r\nIt was in this home that Harriet Martineau did all the work that has\r\nnow been recorded after her return from America. No one who has the\r\nleast conception of how imperatively necessary domestic peace and\r\ncomfort are for the relief of the brain taxed with literary labor,\r\nwill be surprised to hear that Harriet's strength and spirits failed\r\nduring all that summer and winter in which she was writing\r\n_Deerbrook_, and that presently her health completely broke down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEARS OF ILLNESS AND THE MESMERIC RECOVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after the publication of _Deerbrook_ Harriet\r\nstarted for a Continental tour. She was to escort an invalid cousin to\r\nSwitzerland, and afterwards to travel through Italy with two other\r\nfriends. But her illness became so severe by the time that she reached\r\nVenice that the remainder of the journey had to be abandoned. Under\r\nmedical advice, a couch was fitted up in the travelling carriage, and\r\nupon it, lifted in and out at every stage, she returned to England and\r\nwas conveyed to her sister's at Newcastle-on-Tyne. In the autumn of\r\nthat same year (1839) she took up her abode in Front street,\r\nTynemouth, in order to remain under the medical care of her\r\nbrother-in-law, Mr. Greenhow of Newcastle.\r\n\r\nHer physical sufferings during the next five years were very severe,\r\nand almost incessant. She could not go out of the house, and\r\nalternated only between her bed in one room and her couch in another.\r\nFrom her sick-room window she overlooked a narrow space of down, the\r\nruins of the priory, the harbor with its traffic, and the sea. On the\r\nfarther side of the harbor she could discern through the telescope a\r\nrailroad, a spreading heath, and, on the hills which bounded the view,\r\ntwo or three farms. To this outlook she, whose life had been hitherto\r\nspent so actively, and in the midst of such a throng of society, found\r\nherself confined for a term of five years. At the same time her pain\r\nwas so great that she was compelled to take opiates daily. \"I have\r\nobserved, with inexpressible shame, that with the newspaper in my\r\nhand, no details of the peril of empires, or of the starving miseries\r\nof thousands, could keep my eye from the watch before me, or detain my\r\nattention one second beyond the time when I might have my opiate. For\r\ntwo years, too, I wished and intended to dispense with my opiate for\r\nonce, to try how much there was to bear, and how I should bear it; but\r\nI never did it, strong as was the shame of always yielding. I am\r\nconvinced that there is no more possibility of becoming inured to\r\nacute agony of body, than to paroxysms of remorse--the severest of\r\nmoral pains. A familiar pain becomes more and more dreaded, instead of\r\nbecoming more lightly esteemed in proportion to its familiarity. The\r\npain itself becomes more odious, more oppressive, more feared in\r\nproportion to the accumulation of experience of weary hours, in\r\nproportion to the aggregate of painful associations which every\r\nvisitation revives.\"[9]\r\n\r\n          [9] _Life in the Sick-Room._\r\n\r\nSome indication of what she endured in those weary years is given in\r\nthis quotation. If we had to rely upon the inferences to be drawn from\r\nthe amount of work which she did in her sick-room, we should naturally\r\nsuppose the suffering not to have been very great; for she produced,\r\nin the midst of her illness, as much and as noble work as we look for\r\nfrom the most active persons in ordinary health.\r\n\r\nThe first business of the sick-room life was to write both an article\r\nfor publication, and a number of letters of personal appeal to\r\nfriends, on behalf of Oberlin College, an institution which was being\r\nfounded in America for the education of persons of color of both\r\nsexes, and of the students who had been turned out of Lane College for\r\ntheir advocacy of anti-slavery principles.\r\n\r\nThe next undertaking was another novel; or, rather, a history,\r\nimaginatively treated, of the negro revolution in San Domingo.\r\nToussaint L'Ouverture, the leader of the revolution and the president\r\nof the black Republic of Hayti, was the hero of this story. _The Hour\r\nand the Man_, as a mere novel, is vastly superior to _Deerbrook_.\r\nHarriet wrote it, however, rather as a contribution to the same\r\nanti-slavery cause for which she had written her preceding article,\r\nbelieving that it would be useful to that cause to show forth the\r\ncapacity and the high moral character which had been displayed by a\r\nnegro of the blackest shade when in possession of power. The work was\r\nbegun in May, 1840, and published in November of the same year.\r\n\r\nLord Jeffrey, in a familiar private letter to Empson, his successor in\r\nthe editorship of the _Edinburgh Review_, wrote thus of _The Hour and\r\nthe Man_:--\r\n\r\n    I have read Harriet's first volume, and give in my adhesion to her\r\n    Black Prince with all my heart and soul. The book is really not\r\n    only beautiful and touching, but _noble_; and I do not recollect\r\n    when I have been more charmed, whether by very sweet and eloquent\r\n    writing and glowing description, or by elevated as well as tender\r\n    sentiments.... The book is calculated to make its readers better,\r\n    and does great honor to the heart as well as the talent and fancy\r\n    of the author. I would go a long way to kiss the hem of her\r\n    garment, or the hand that delineated this glowing and lofty\r\n    representation of purity and noble virtue. And she must not only\r\n    be rescued from all debasing anxieties about her subsistence, but\r\n    placed in a station of affluence and honor; though I believe she\r\n    truly cares for none of these things. It is sad to think that she\r\n    suffers so much, and may even be verging to dissolution.\r\n\r\nEven the morose and ungracious Carlyle, writing to Emerson of this\r\nbook, is obliged to say \"It is beautiful as a child's heart; and in so\r\nshrewd a brain!\" While Florence Nightingale declares that she \"can\r\nscarcely refrain from thinking of it as the greatest of historical\r\nromances.\"\r\n\r\nThe allusion in the latter part of Lord Jeffrey's letter was to a\r\nproposal just then made to give Harriet Martineau one of the Civil\r\nList literary pensions. This idea had been mooted first during the\r\nprogress of her _Illustrations_, and again after her return from\r\nAmerica; but upon each occasion she had stated privately that she\r\nwould not be willing to accept it. She replied from Tynemouth to the\r\nsame effect to Mr. Hutton, who wrote to inquire if she would now be\r\nthus assisted. Her objection was, in the first place, one of\r\nprinciple; she disapproved of the money of the people being dispensed\r\nin any pensions at the sole will of the Ministry, instead of being\r\nconferred directly by the representatives of the people. Her second\r\nreason was, that after accepting she would feel herself bound to the\r\nMinisters, and would be understood by the public to be so bound, and\r\nwould thus suffer a loss of both freedom and usefulness during\r\nwhatever life might remain to her. Lord Melbourne, a few months later,\r\nin July, 1841, made her an explicit offer of a pension of L150 per\r\nannum, and her answer to the Minister was substantially the same as to\r\nher friend. She said that while taxation was levied so unequally, and\r\nwhile Parliament had no voice in the distribution of pensions, she\r\nwould rather receive public aid from the parish, if necessary, than as\r\na pensioner. She added an earnest plea that all influential persons\r\nwho held themselves indebted on public grounds to any writer, would\r\nshow that gratitude by endeavoring to make better copyright\r\narrangements and foreign treaties, so as to secure to authors the\r\nfull, due and independent reward of their efforts.\r\n\r\nThe rare (perhaps mistaken) generosity of this refusal can only be\r\nappreciated by bearing in mind that she had invested a large part of\r\nher earnings a few years before in a form from which she was now\r\nreceiving no return. During her illness she was really in want of\r\nmoney, so far as to have to accept assistance from relatives. For\r\nher charities she partly provided by doing fancy-work, sending\r\nsubscriptions both in this form and in the shape of articles for\r\npublication to the anti-slavery cause in America.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1841 she began a series of four children's\r\nstories, which were published under the general title of _The\r\nPlayfellow_. These admirable tales are still amongst the best-known\r\nand most popular of her writings; simple, vivid and interesting, they\r\nare really model children's stories, and it would have been quite\r\nimpossible for any reader to imagine that they were written by an\r\ninvalid, in constant suffering. _Settlers at Home_ was the first one\r\nwritten, _The Prince and the Peasant_ came next; then _Feats on the\r\nFjord_; and, finally, that one from which I quoted largely in an early\r\nchapter, _The Crofton Boys_. By the time the last-named was finished\r\nshe was very ill, and believed that she should never write another\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nHer interest in all public affairs continued, nevertheless, to be as\r\nkeen as ever. In 1841 she wrote for publication a long letter to\r\nsupport the American Anti-Slavery Society under a secession from its\r\nranks of a number of persons, chiefly clerical, who objected, of all\r\nthings, to women being allowed to be members of the society! Another\r\npiece of work which she did for the public benefit was by a course of\r\ncorrespondence, full of delicate tact, to personally reconcile Sir\r\nRobert Peel and Mr. Cobden, and so to pave the way for the amicable\r\nwork of the two statesmen in the repeal of the Corn Laws.\r\n\r\nIn 1843, some of her friends who knew her circumstances, and that she\r\nhad refused a pension, collected money to present her with a\r\ntestimonial. L1,400, thus obtained, was invested for her benefit in\r\nthe Terminable Long Annuities, and a considerable sum besides was\r\nexpended in a present of plate. The Ladies Lambton (the eldest of\r\nwhom, as Countess of Elgin, was afterwards one of her warmest friends)\r\nwent over to Tynemouth to use the plate with her for the first time,\r\nand \"it was a testimonial fete.\"\r\n\r\nIt was about this time, too, that the personal acquaintance, destined\r\nto become an intimate association in work, between Harriet Martineau\r\nand Florence Nightingale was commenced. Miss Martineau's younger\r\nsister Ellen had been governess in Miss Nightingale's family.\r\nSick-nursing occupied Florence Nightingale's hands and heart long\r\nbefore the Crimean War made her famous, and Harriet Martineau was one\r\nof the sick to whom she ministered in those earlier days.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1843, Harriet's mind had accumulated a store of\r\nthoughts and feelings which imperatively pressed to be poured forth.\r\nShe wrote then, in about six weeks, her volume of essays, _Life in\r\nthe Sick-Room_. The book was published under the pseudonym of \"An\r\nInvalid,\" but was immediately attributed to her on all hands. It is a\r\nmost interesting record of the high thoughts and feelings by which so\r\nmelancholy an experience as years of suffering, of an apparently\r\nhopeless character, can be elevated, and made productive of benefit to\r\nthe sufferer's own nature. Incidentally there is much wise counsel in\r\nthe volume for those who have the care of invalids of this class.\r\n\r\nAmidst the many expressions of admiration and interest which this work\r\ndrew forth, the following is perhaps most worthy of preservation\r\nbecause of the source whence it came. Mr. Quillinan, Wordsworth's\r\nson-in-law, wrote as follows to his friend, Henry Crabbe Robinson, on\r\nDecember 9, 1843:--\r\n\r\n    Mr. Wordsworth, Mrs. Wordsworth and Miss Fenwick have been quite\r\n    charmed, affected, and instructed by the invalid's volume....\r\n    Mrs. Wordsworth, after a few pages were read, at once pronounced\r\n    it to be Miss Martineau's production, and concluded that you\r\n    knew all about it and caused it to be sent hither. In some of\r\n    the most eloquent parts it stops short of their wishes and\r\n    expectations: but they all agree that it is _a rare book_, doing\r\n    honor to the head and heart of your able and interesting friend.\r\n    Mr. Wordsworth praised it with more unreserve--I may say, with\r\n    more _earnestness_--than is usual with him. The serene and\r\n    heavenly-minded Miss Fenwick was prodigal of her admiration. But\r\n    Mrs. Wordsworth's was the crowning praise. She said--and you\r\n    know how she would say it--\"I wish I had read exactly such a\r\n    book as that years ago!\"... It is a _genuine_ and touching\r\n    series of meditations by an invalid not sick in mind or\r\n    heart.[10]\r\n\r\n          [10] _Diary and Letters of H. C. Robinson_, vol. iii.,\r\n          p. 235.\r\n\r\nFrom one of the letters with which Mr. Henry G. Atkinson has favored\r\nme and my readers, I find that she wrote a chapter for that book,\r\nwhich undoubtedly must have been of the deepest interest, but which\r\nwas not published.\r\n\r\n    LETTER TO MR. ATKINSON.\r\n\r\n    [Extract.]\r\n    November 19, 1872.\r\n\r\n    DEAR FRIEND:\r\n\r\n    ... You will feel at once how earnestly\r\n    I must be longing for death--I who never loved life, and who would\r\n    any day of my life have rather departed than stayed. Well! it can\r\n    hardly go on very much longer now. But I do wish it was permitted\r\n    to us to judge for ourselves a little how long we ought to carry\r\n    on the task which we never desired and could not refuse, and how\r\n    soon we may fairly relieve our comrades from the burden of taking\r\n    care of us. I wonder whether the chapter I wrote about this for\r\n    the \"Sick-Room\" book will ever see the light. I rather wish it\r\n    may, because I believe it utters what many people think and feel.\r\n    I let it be omitted from that book because it might perhaps injure\r\n    the impression of the rest of the volume; but, so far as I\r\n    remember it, it is worth considering, and therefore publishing.\r\n\r\nI have made such inquiries as I could (of one of Miss Martineau's\r\nexecutors and others), but can get no tidings of this missing chapter\r\non Euthanasia. It was just such a subject--needing for its discussion,\r\ncourage, calmness, common sense, and logic, combined with sympathy,\r\nand a high standard of moral beauty and goodness--as she would have\r\nbeen sure to treat rarely well. There is one passage in _Life in the\r\nSick-Room_, bearing upon the question; she observes that the great\r\nreason why hopeless invalids so commonly endure on when they are\r\nlonging for the rest of insensibility, is the uncertainty as to\r\nwhether they may not find themselves still conscious in another state.\r\nHer own history was to supply a stronger reason still against the\r\nirrevocable action being taken upon our rash assumptions that our work\r\nand our usefulness in life are ended. As she truly observed: \"No one\r\nknows when the spirits of men begin to work, or when they leave off,\r\nor whether they work best when their bodies are weak, or when they are\r\nstrong. Every human creature that has a spirit in him must therefore\r\nbe taken care of, and kept alive as long as possible, that his spirit\r\nmay do all it can in the world.\" So she wrote at that very\r\ntime--showing how her mind was pondering every view of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe sentence just quoted is from _Dawn Island_, a little one-hundred\r\npaged story which she wrote in the midst of her suffering, as her\r\ncontribution to the funds of the Anti-Corn Law League. It was printed\r\nand sold for the benefit of that league, at the great bazaar of 1845.\r\n\r\nAfter the publication of the \"Sick-Room\" book, she commenced the\r\nwriting of her autobiography--not as it was published afterwards, be\r\nit understood--for she was too ill to make much progress with it, and\r\nsoon stopped writing. But she _never_ became too ill to feel and\r\nto show a vivid interest in every cause that had the happiness and\r\nprogress of mankind for its object. She kept up an extensive\r\ncorrespondence with those engaged in the world's work, and such\r\npersonal efforts for public objects as those above mentioned she\r\nfrequently exerted--sometimes over-exerted--herself to make. Her body\r\nwas chained to two small rooms; but her mind, with all its powers and\r\naffections, yet swept freely through the universe. No one would have\r\nbeen more impatient than she herself of any pretence that she lived\r\nincessantly on a high plane of lofty emotions, where pain ceased to be\r\nfelt, or that her care for others was so extraordinary that\r\nself-regard was swallowed up in the depths of altruism. I have quoted\r\nher candid revelations about her sufferings and her opiates, to avoid\r\nthe possibility of conveying an impression that she was thus guilty of\r\nhypocrisy or affectation. But the wide interests and the sympathies\r\nwith mankind that were the solace of her sick life, and the\r\ninspiration of the work which she did so heavily, and yet so\r\ncontinuously, amidst her pain, assuredly shall be marked with the\r\nreverence that they merit.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 the long illness came to an end. Harriet Martineau was\r\nrestored to perfect health by means of mesmerism. Such a cure of such\r\na person could not fail to make a great sensation. Not only had she a\r\nwide circle of personal acquaintances, but she had deeply impressed\r\nthe public at large with a sense of her perfect sanity, her calm\r\ncommon-sense, and her practical wisdom, as well as with a conviction\r\nof her truthfulness and accuracy. Accordingly, as the _Zoist_\r\n(Dr. Elliotson's mesmeric periodical) declared at the time:--\r\n\r\n    The subject which the critic, a few months since, would not\r\n    condescend to notice, has been elevated to a commanding position.\r\n    It is the topic with which the daily papers and the weekly\r\n    periodicals are filled; in fact, all classes are moved by one\r\n    common consent, and mesmerism, from the palace to the smallest\r\n    town in the United Kingdom, is the scientific question absorbing\r\n    public attention.... The immediate cause of all this activity, is\r\n    the publication of the case of Miss Martineau, who, after five\r\n    years' incessant suffering and confinement to her couch, is now\r\n    well.\r\n\r\nI have thought that what needs to be said here of the medical aspect\r\nand course of this period of suffering, and of the final cure, will\r\nbest be said consecutively; and, therefore, we will look back briefly\r\nover the five busy but suffering years, the work of which has now been\r\nrecorded, and see what were the physical conditions under which that\r\nwork was executed.\r\n\r\nHer health had been declining gradually from 1834 to 1839; there was a\r\nslow but a marked deterioration in strength, and her spirits became\r\ndepressed. In April of the latter year, when she undertook a\r\ncontinental journey the fatigue of travelling suddenly aggravated her\r\ncondition; and in Venice, early in June, she was compelled to consult\r\na physician, Dr. Nardo. She was found to be suffering from a tumor,\r\nwith enlargement and displacement of an important organ, all this\r\ncausing great internal pain, accompanied by frequent weakening\r\nhemorrhages. She was carried back to England by easy stages, and lying\r\non a couch, and reached Newcastle-on-Tyne at the end of July, 1839.\r\nShe stayed for some time at the house in that town of her eldest\r\nsister, and then was removed only nine miles off, in order that her\r\nbrother-in-law, Mr. T. M. Greenhow, F.R.C.S., might undertake the\r\nmedical care of her case. Until October, she persevered in taking\r\nwalking exercise; but the pain, sickness and breathlessness which\r\naccompanied this were so distressing, that soon after her removal to\r\nTynemouth she ceased to go out of doors, or even to descend the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\nMr. Greenhow's prescriptions were confined at first to opiates, and\r\nother medicines to alleviate symptoms. The opiates were not taken in\r\nexcess--as, indeed, the books written in the period would conclusively\r\nprove. The patient's suffering was so great, however, that extreme\r\nrecourse to such palliatives might have been forgiven. She could not\r\nraise the right leg; and could neither sit up for the faintness which\r\nthen ensued, nor lie down with ease because of the pain in her back.\r\n\"She could not sleep at night till she devised a plan of sleeping\r\nunder a basket, for the purpose of keeping the weight of the\r\nbed-clothes from her; and even then she was scared by horrors all\r\nnight, and reduced by sickness during the day. This sickness increased\r\nto such a degree that for two years she was extremely low from want of\r\nfood.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of two years, that is to say, in September, 1841, Sir\r\nCharles Clarke, M.D., was called in consultation; and he prescribed\r\niodine, remarking at the same time that, in his view, such a case as\r\nhers was practically incurable, and admitting that he \"had tried\r\niodine in an infinite number of such cases, and never knew it avail.\"\r\nFor the next _three years_ Miss Martineau took three grains per\r\ndiem of iodide of iron. It relieved the sickness; but up to April,\r\n1844 (two and a half years from the commencement of its\r\nadministration), Mr. Greenhow did not pretend that any improvement in\r\nthe physical condition had taken place. In that month, as he\r\nafterwards said, he believed he found a slight change, \"but he was not\r\nsure\"; and, if any, it was very trifling. The patient, on her part,\r\nwas quite convinced that her state then was in no way altered.\r\n\r\nMore than once different friends--amongst them Lord Lytton, Mr.\r\nHallam, and the Basil Montagus--had urged her to try mesmerism; but\r\nshe had thought it due to her relative to give his orthodox medicines\r\nthe fullest trial, before taking herself out of his hands in such a\r\nway. In June, 1844, however, Mr. Greenhow himself suggested that she\r\nshould be mesmerized. Of course, so advised, she consented to make the\r\ntrial. A Mr. Hall, brought by Mr. Greenhow, accordingly mesmerized her\r\nfor the first time on June 22d, 1844, and again on the following day.\r\n\r\nThe patient thought she experienced some relief, but did not feel\r\nquite sure. \"On occasion of a perfectly new experience, scepticism and\r\nself-distrust are strong.\"[11] The next day, however, set her doubts at\r\nrest. Mr. Hall was unable to come to her, and she asked her maid to\r\nmake the passes in his stead.\r\n\r\n          [11] This and the succeeding quotations are from her \"Letters\r\n          on Mesmerism,\" published in the _Athenaeum_, 1845.\r\n\r\n    Within one minute, the twilight and phosphoric lights appeared;\r\n    and in two or three more a delicious sensation of ease spread\r\n    through me--a cool comfort, before which all pain and distress\r\n    gave way, oozing out, as it were, at the soles of my feet. During\r\n    that hour, and almost the whole evening, I could no more help\r\n    exclaiming with pleasure than a person in torture crying out with\r\n    pain. I became hungry, and ate with relish for the first time for\r\n    five years. There was no heat, oppression, or sickness during the\r\n    _seance_, nor any disorder afterwards. During the whole evening,\r\n    instead of the lazy, hot ease of opiates, under which pain is felt\r\n    to lie in wait, I experienced something of the indescribable\r\n    sensations of health, which I had quite lost and forgotten.\r\n\r\nHer dear friend during all the years that remained to her--Mr. Henry\r\nG. Atkinson[12]--had just come into her life. His interest in her case\r\nwas enlisted by their mutual friend, Basil Montagu; and Mr. Atkinson\r\nundertook to direct the mesmeric treatment by correspondence.\r\nMargaret, the maid, continued the mesmerism till September, and then\r\nMr. Atkinson induced his friend Mrs. Montague Wynyard, the young widow\r\nof a clergyman, to undertake the case. \"In pure zeal and benevolence\r\nthis lady came to me, and has been with me ever since. When I found\r\nmyself able to repose on the knowledge and power (mental and moral) of\r\nmy mesmerist the last impediments to my progress were cleared away and\r\nI improved accordingly.\"\r\n\r\n          [12] As this friendship had a profound influence upon\r\n          Harriet's after thought and work, some description of Mr.\r\n          Atkinson seems in place; and I need offer that gentleman no\r\n          apology for merely quoting what has appeared in print before\r\n          about him. Margaret Fuller wrote thus of him in a private\r\n          letter, in 1846:--\r\n\r\n              \"Mr. Atkinson is a man about thirty, in the fullness of\r\n              his powers, tall and finely formed, with a head for\r\n              Leonardo to paint; mild and composed, but powerful and\r\n              sagacious; he does not think, but perceives and acts. He\r\n              is intimate with artists, having studied architecture\r\n              himself as a profession; but has some fortune on which he\r\n              lives. Sometimes stationary and acting in the affairs of\r\n              other men; sometimes wandering about the world and\r\n              learning; he seems bound by no tie, yet looks as if he\r\n              had relatives in every place.\"--_Memoirs of Margaret\r\n              Fuller_, by Emerson.\r\n\r\nOn December the 6th Mr. Greenhow found his patient quite well, and\r\nabout to leave the place of her imprisonment, and start on a series of\r\nfriendly visits. He declared, notwithstanding, that firstly, her\r\n_physical condition_ was not essentially different from what it had\r\nbeen all through; secondly, that the change in her _sensations_ arose\r\nfrom the iodine suddenly and miraculously becoming more effective, and\r\nnot from mesmerism.\r\n\r\nSuch is the medical history, so interesting to all physiological\r\nstudents and to all sufferers of the same class, of Harriet\r\nMartineau's five years' illness and recovery. My business is simply to\r\nstate facts, and I need not here undertake any dissertation upon\r\nmesmerism. It is sufficient to add that only those who are unaware of\r\nthe profundity of our ignorance (up to the present day) about the\r\naction of the nervous system, and still more about what _life_\r\nreally is, can be excused for rash jeering and hasty incredulity in\r\nsuch a case as this.\r\n\r\nHarriet Martineau knew that she was well again, and it seemed to her a\r\nclear duty to make as public as possible the history of how her\r\nrecovery had been brought about. She did so by six letters to the\r\n_Athenaeum_; and these were reprinted in pamphlet form. Mr. Greenhow\r\nwas thereupon guilty of one of the most serious professional faults\r\npossible. He also published an account of _The Case of Miss H. M._, in\r\na shilling pamphlet, giving the most minute and painful details of her\r\nillness, and respecting no confidence that had been reposed in his\r\nmedical integrity. The result of this conduct on his part was that his\r\npatient felt herself compelled to break off all future intercourse\r\nwith a man capable of such objectionable action.\r\n\r\nIt may be added here that the cure was a permanent one.[13] She enjoyed\r\nten years of health so good that she declared it taught her that in no\r\nprevious period of her life had she ever been well. It may be as well\r\nto say that she never wavered in her assurance that her cure was\r\nworked by mesmerism, and that the cure was complete. All dispute about\r\nher firm conviction on this point may be set at rest by the following\r\nextracts from\r\n\r\n    LETTERS TO MR. ATKINSON.\r\n\r\n    [Extract.]\r\n    July 6, 1874.\r\n\r\n    Notices of my mesmeric experience in illness have revived an\r\n    anxiety of mine about what may happen when I am gone, if certain\r\n    parties should bring up the old falsehoods again, when I am not\r\n    here to assert and prove the truth. I don't in the least suppose\r\n    you can help me, any more than Mrs. Chapman, whom I have got to\r\n    look over a box of papers of mine deposited with her. But I had\r\n    rather tell you what is on my mind about it.\r\n\r\n    I wrote, at Tynemouth, a diary of my case and experience under\r\n    the mesmeric experiment (experiment desired and proposed by Mr.\r\n    Greenhow himself). _He_ read it when finished, and so did several\r\n    of my friends. There are two copies somewhere, for, not wishing to\r\n    show certain passages, rather saucy, about the Greenhow prejudices\r\n    and behavior, I accepted Mrs. Wynyard's kind offer to copy the\r\n    MS., omitting those remarks. Now where are those MSS? I cannot\r\n    find them, nor say what I did with them, beyond having a dim\r\n    notion that they (or at least Mrs. Wynyard's copy) were put away\r\n    into some safe place, to await future chances. I perfectly\r\n    remember the look of the packet, and the label on it, etc. When I\r\n    remember what was said after reading it, by one of the wisest\r\n    people I have known, I am _shocked_ at our inability to find\r\n    it. \"One must dispute anything being the cause of anything, if one\r\n    disputes after reading this statement, that your recovery is due\r\n    to mesmerism.\" And now, while I see false statements of the\r\n    \"facts,\" and false references circulating, as at present, I cannot\r\n    find my own narrative, written from day to day, and do not know\r\n    where to turn next! If I had strength I would turn out all the\r\n    papers in my possession, and make sure for myself. Now, dear\r\n    friend, do you think you ever saw that statement?\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Extract.]\r\n    September 18, 1874.\r\n\r\n    My malady was absolutely unlike cancer, and it never had any sort\r\n    of relation to \"malignant\" disease. The doctors called it\r\n    \"indolent tumor--most probably polypus.\" Don't you remember how,\r\n    at that very time, the great dispute on Elliotson's hands was\r\n    whether any instance could be adduced of cure of organic disease\r\n    by mesmerism? Elliotson was nearly certain, but not quite, of the\r\n    cure of a cancer case in his own practice. The doctors were full\r\n    of the controversy, and some of them wrote both to me and to Mr.\r\n    Greenhow to inquire the nature of my case, whether malignant or\r\n    not. Of course we both replied \"No.\" It would be a dreadful\r\n    misfortune if now anybody concerned should tell a different story.\r\n    Greenhow is still living (aged 82) and all alive; and he would\r\n    like nothing better than to get hold of it, and bring out another\r\n    indecent pamphlet. If I could but lay hands on the diary of the\r\n    case, written at the time, what a security it would be? But I can\r\n    nowhere find it. The next best security is turning back to the\r\n    statement, \"Letters\" in the _Athenaeum_ of the autumn of 1844.\r\n    Those \"Letters\" went through two editions when reprinted, after\r\n    having carried those numbers of the _Athenaeum_ through three\r\n    editions. One would think the narrative must be accessible enough.\r\n    Above all things, let there be no mistake in our statements.\r\n\r\n    It ought to be enough for observers that I had ten years of robust\r\n    health after that recovery, walking from sixteen to twenty miles\r\n    in a day, on occasion, and riding a camel in the heart of Nubia,\r\n    and hundreds of miles on horseback, through Palestine to Damascus,\r\n    and back to the Levant.\r\n\r\n    I have written so much because I could not help it. I shall hardly\r\n    do it again. I will add only that the mesmerizing began in June,\r\n    1844, and the cure was effected before the following Christmas.\r\n\r\n    Dear friend,\r\n\r\n    I am yours ever,\r\n\r\n    H. M.\r\n\r\n          [13] I find there is a widespread impression that she\r\n          eventually died of the same tumor that she supposed to have\r\n          been cured at this time. It should be distinctly stated,\r\n          however, that if this were the case, Mr. Greenhow and Sir C.\r\n          Clarke were both _utterly_ wrong in their diagnosis in\r\n          1840. I have read Mr. Greenhow's _Report of the Case of\r\n          Miss H. M._, and the notes of the post-mortem lie before\r\n          me--kindly lent me by the surgeon, Mr. King, now of Bedford\r\n          Park, who made the autopsy. I find that the organ which Mr.\r\n          Greenhow and his consultant both stated to be the seat of the\r\n          disease, enlargement and tumor, in 1840, is described as\r\n          being found \"particularly small and unaffected\" after death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE HOME LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt forty-two years old, Harriet Martineau found herself free for the\r\nfirst time to form and take possession of a _home of her own_. Now,\r\nfor the first time, she could have the luxury which many girls obtain\r\nby marriage so young that they spoil it to themselves and others, and\r\nwhich it is as natural for each grown woman to desire, irrespective of\r\nmarriage, as it is for a fledged bird to leave the old nest--a house\r\nand a domestic circle in which she could be the organizing spirit,\r\nwhere the home arrangements should be of her own ordering, and where\r\nshe could have the privacy and self-management which can no otherwise\r\nbe enjoyed, in combination with the exercise of that housewifely skill\r\nto which all women more or less incline.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the scenery led her to fix upon the English lakes for\r\nthe locality in which to make her home, and, finding no suitable house\r\nvacant, she resolved to build one for herself. She purchased two acres\r\nof land, within half-a-mile of the village of Ambleside; borrowed some\r\nmoney on mortgage from a well-to-do cousin; had the plans drawn out\r\nunder her own instructions, and watched the house being built so that\r\nit should suit her own tastes.\r\n\r\nIt is a pretty little gabled house, built of gray stone, and stands\r\nupon a small rocky eminence--whence its name \"the Knoll.\" There is\r\nenough rock to hold the house, and to allow the formation of a terrace\r\nabout twenty feet wide in front of the windows; then there comes the\r\ndescent of the face of the rock. At the foot of the rock is the\r\ngarden. Narrow flights of steps at either end of the terrace lead down\r\nto the greensward and the flower-beds; in the centre of these is a\r\ngray granite sun-dial, with the characteristic motto around it--\"Come\r\nLight! Visit me!\" To the left is the gardener's cottage, with the\r\ncow-house, pig-stye and root-shed. The front of the house looks across\r\nthe garden, and over the valley to Loughrigg. Its back is turned to\r\nthe road, and concealed from passers-by, partly by the growth of\r\ngreenery, and partly by the Methodist Chapel. A winding path leads up\r\nfrom the road to the house, and a small path forking off from this\r\ngoes round past the cottage to the field where the cows used to graze,\r\nand to the piece of land that was appropriated to growing the roots\r\nfor the cows and the household fruit and vegetables.\r\n\r\nWithin, \"The Knoll\" is just a nice little residence for a maiden lady,\r\nwith her small household, and room for an occasional guest. You enter\r\nby a covered porch, and find the drawing-room on the right hand of the\r\nhall. It is a fairly large room, and remarkably well-lighted; there\r\nwas a window-tax when she built, but she showed her faith in the\r\ngrowth of political common-sense abrogating so mischievous an impost,\r\nby building in anticipation of freedom of light and air from taxation.\r\nThe drawing-room has two large windows, one of which descends quite to\r\nthe floor, and is provided with two or three stone steps outside, so\r\nthat the inmates may readily step forth on to the terrace. This\r\nwindow, by the way, exposed her to another tax than the Government\r\none. Hunters of celebrities were wont, in the tourist season, not\r\nmerely to walk round her garden and terrace without leave, but even to\r\nmount these steps and flatten the tips of their noses against her\r\nwindow. Objectionable as the liability to this friendly attention\r\nwould be felt by most of us, it was doubly so to Miss Martineau\r\nbecause of her deafness, which precluded her from receiving warning of\r\nher admirers' approaches from the crunching of their footsteps on the\r\ngravel--so that the first intimation that she would receive of their\r\npresence would be to turn her head by chance and find the flattened\r\nnose and the peering eyes against the window-pane. There is a special\r\nrecord of one occasion, when her bell rang in an agitated fashion, and\r\nthe maid, on going, found her mistress much disturbed. \"There is a\r\n_big_ woman, with a _big_ pattern on her dress, beckoning to me to\r\ncome to the window--go, and tell her to go away.\" But similar\r\nincidents were manifold, and her servants had to be trained to guard\r\ntheir mistress as if she were the golden apples of the Hesperides.\r\nIndeed, for several years (till she became too ill to travel) she used\r\nto leave her lake-side home altogether during the tourist season.\r\n\r\nIn her latest years she commonly wrote in the drawing-room, as the\r\nsunniest and most cheerful apartment, and where, too, she could sit by\r\nthe fire, and yet get plenty of daylight. Her proper study, however,\r\nwas the room on the opposite side of the hall. This is a long room\r\nwith a bay window at the other end of the fire-place, and the door in\r\nthe centre. Book-cases lined the whole of these walls; but her library\r\nwas an extensive one, and there were books all over the house. This\r\nroom served as dining-room and study, both; the writing table was near\r\nthe window, the dining-table further towards the fire.\r\n\r\nThe only other room on the ground floor is the kitchen, which runs\r\nparallel with the drawing-room. Her principles and her practice went\r\nhand-in-hand in her domestic arrangements as in her life generally;\r\nand her kitchen was as airy, light and comfortable for her maids as\r\nher drawing-room was for herself. The kitchen, too, was provided with\r\na book-case for a servants' library. A scullery, dairy, etc., are\r\nannexed to the kitchen, and the entrance to the cellars below is also\r\nfound through the green baize door which shuts off the cooking region\r\nfrom the front of the house.\r\n\r\nUp-stairs, that which was her own room is large and cheerful, and\r\nprovided with two windows, a big hanging cupboard, and a good sized\r\ndressing-room--the latter indeed, fully large enough for a maid to\r\nsleep in. The next was the spare-room; and there lingers no small\r\ninterest about the guest-chamber, where Harriet Martineau received\r\nsuch guests as Charlotte Bronte, George Eliot, Emerson, and Douglas\r\nJerrold. A small servants' room is next to this, and a larger one is\r\nover the kitchen, so that it comes just at the head of the stairs.\r\nSuch is the size and arrangement of Harriet Martineau's home.\r\n\r\nClimbing plants soon covered \"The Knoll\" on every side. The ivy kept\r\nit green through all the year; the porch was embowered in honeysuckle,\r\nclematis, passion-flower, and Virginia creeper. Wordsworth, Macready,\r\nand other friends of note, planted trees for Harriet below the\r\nterrace. The making of all these arrangements was a source of\r\nsatisfaction and delight to her such as can only be imagined by those\r\nwho have felt what it is to come abroad after a long and painful\r\nconfinement from illness, and to find life and usefulness freely open\r\nagain under agreeable conditions and prospects.\r\n\r\nWhile her house was being built, she lodged in Ambleside; and in that\r\ntime, during the autumn and winter of 1845-6, she wrote her _Forest\r\nand Game Law Tales_, with the object of showing how mischievous the\r\ngame laws were in their operation upon society at large, and more\r\nparticularly upon the fortunes of individual farmers, and upon the\r\nlaborers who were led into poaching. These tales occupy three volumes\r\nof the ordinary novel size. They had a sale which would have been very\r\ngood for a novel; two thousand copies were disposed of, and doubtless\r\ndid some service for the cause for which she had worked. So far as her\r\nown pecuniary interests were concerned, however, these tales made her\r\nfirst failure. It was the only work which never returned her any\r\nremuneration. The publisher had reckoned on a very large circulation,\r\nand so had put out too much capital in stock, stereotypes, and the\r\nlike, to leave any profit on the sale that actually took place; and\r\nthe publication unfortunately coincided with the agitation of the\r\npolitical world about the repeal of the corn laws. But one pleasing\r\nincident arose out of them for her personally. She had been in\r\ndifficulties as to how to obtain turf to lay down upon the land under\r\nher terrace. One fine morning, soon after her entrance on her home,\r\nher maid found a great heap of sods under the window, when she opened\r\nthe shutters in the morning. A dirty note, closed with a wafer, was\r\nstuck upon the pile, and this was found to state that the sods were \"a\r\ntoken of gratitude for the _Game Law Tales_, from a Poacher.\" Harriet\r\nnever discovered from whom this tribute came.\r\n\r\nShe took possession of her home on April 7th, 1846. During the summer\r\nshe wrote another story for young people--one of her most interesting\r\ntales, and instructive in its moral bearing--_The Billow and the\r\nRock_. It must here be noted, in passing, that this is the last of\r\nher works in which the theism that she had, up to this time, held for\r\nreligious truth, makes itself visible. A new experience was about to\r\nlead her to think afresh upon the theological subjects, and to revise\r\nher opinions about the genesis of faiths, and their influence upon\r\nmorals.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1846, she accepted an invitation from her friends,\r\nMr. and Mrs. R. V. Yates, of Liverpool, to join them in a journey to\r\nthe East, they bearing the expense. The party left England in October,\r\nand were met at Malta by Mr. J. C. Ewart, afterwards M.P. for\r\nLiverpool. Together, these four travellers sailed up the Nile to the\r\nsecond cataract, studied Thebes and Philae, went up and into the Great\r\nPyramid, visited bazaars, mosques and (the ladies) harems, in Cairo.\r\nThen they travelled in the track of Moses in the desert, passing Sinai\r\nand reaching Petra. Next, they completely traversed Palestine; and\r\nfinally, passed through Syria to Beyrout, where they took ship again\r\nfor home. This journey occupied eight months.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1847, Harriet reached \"The Knoll\" again, and settled\r\nherself in her permanent course of home life. As the same habits were\r\ncontinued, with only the interruptions of occasional visits to other\r\nparts of the country, day by day, for many years, I may as well\r\nmention what was the course of that daily home life.\r\n\r\nShe rose very early: not infrequently, in the winter, before daylight;\r\nand immediately set out for a good, long walk. Sometimes, I am told,\r\nshe would appear at a farm-house, four miles off, before the cows were\r\nmilked. The old post-mistress recollects how, when she was making up\r\nher early letter-bags, in the gray of the morning mists, Miss\r\nMartineau would come down with her large bundle of correspondence, and\r\nnever failed to have a pleasant nod and smile, or a few kindly\r\ninquiries, for her humble friend. \"I always go out before it is quite\r\nlight,\" writes Miss Martineau to Mr. Atkinson, in November, 1847; \"and\r\nin the fine mornings I go up the hill behind the church--the Kirkstone\r\nroad--where I reach a great height, and see from half way along\r\nWindermere to Rydal. When the little shred of moon that is left and\r\nthe morning star hang over Wansfell, among the amber clouds of the\r\napproaching sunrise, it is delicious. On the positively rainy\r\nmornings, my walk is to Pelter Bridge and back. Sometimes it is round\r\nthe south end of the valley. These early walks (I sit down to my\r\nbreakfast at half-past seven) are good, among other things, in\r\npreparing me in mind for my work.\"\r\n\r\nReturning home, she breakfasted at half-past seven; filled her lamp\r\nready for the evening, and arranged all household matters; and by\r\nhalf-past eight was at her desk, where she worked undisturbed till\r\ntwo, the early dinner-time. These business hours were sacred, whether\r\nthere were visitors in the house or not. After dinner, however, she\r\ndevoted herself to guests, if there were any; if not, she took another\r\nwalk, or in bad weather, did wool-work--\"many a square yard of which,\"\r\nshe says, she \"all invisibly embossed with thoughts and feelings\r\nworked in.\" Tea and the newspaper came together, after which she\r\neither read, wrote letters, or conversed for the rest of the evening,\r\nending her day always, whatever the weather, by a few moments of\r\nsilent meditation in the porch or on the terrace without.\r\n\r\nShe was not one of those mistresses who cannot talk to their servants,\r\nany more than she was one to indulge them in idle and familiar gossip.\r\nIf there were any special news of the day, she would invite the maids\r\ninto her sitting-room for half an hour in the evening, to tell them\r\nabout it. During the Crimean War, and again during the American\r\nstruggle, in particular, the servants had the frequent privilege of\r\ntracing with her on the map the position of the battles, and learning\r\nwith her aid to understand the great questions that were at stake.\r\n\r\nThe servants thus trained and considered[14] were not, certainly,\r\ncommon domestics. She kept two girls in the house, besides the\r\nlaboring man and his wife at the cottage; and, as the place was small,\r\nand her way of living simple, the work did not require that she should\r\nchoose rough women for servants merely because of their strength. On\r\nthe contrary, she made special efforts to secure young girls of a\r\nsomewhat superior order, whom she might train and attach to herself.\r\nShe got servants whom she had to dismiss now and again, of course; but\r\nthe time that most of her maids stopped with her and the warm feelings\r\nthat they showed towards her, are a high testimony to the domestic\r\ncharacter of their \"strong minded\" mistress. At the time of which we\r\nare now speaking, her maids were \"Jane,\" who had been cured from\r\nchronic illness by Miss Martineau's mesmerizing, and who was in her\r\nservice for seven years, when the girl emigrated; and \"Martha,\" who\r\nhad been trained for teaching, and had to resign it from ill-health,\r\nbut who later on married the master of Miss Carpenter's Bristol Ragged\r\nSchools, and returned to teaching, after serving Miss Martineau for\r\nsome eight years.\r\n\r\n          [14] Henry Crabbe Robinson writes to Miss Fenwick on January\r\n          15, 1849:--\r\n\r\n              \"Miss Martineau makes herself an object of envy by the\r\n              success of her domestic arrangements.... Mrs. Wordsworth\r\n              declares she is a model in her household economy, making\r\n              her servants happy, and setting an example of activity to\r\n              her neighbors.\"\r\n\r\nOf the servants who came after this, \"Caroline\" was there twenty\r\nyears, till she was removed by death; and \"Mary Anne\" served Miss\r\nMartineau eleven years, till the mistress's death closed the long term\r\nof attendance and almost filial love.\r\n\r\nIndications of how different the relationship was in this home from\r\nwhat it only too often is, are found in many of Miss Martineau's\r\nletters. When \"Martha\" married, she had the rare honor of having\r\nHarriet Martineau and Mary Carpenter for her bridesmaids. The mistress\r\ngave the wedding breakfast, and partook of it, too, in company with\r\nthe bride and bridegroom and their friends; and when she had seen them\r\nall off, she sat down to write to her family about her loss \"with a\r\nbursting heart.\" References to her feelings for her \"dear friend,\r\nCaroline,\" will be seen presently in her letters to Mr. Atkinson; and\r\nher care and affection for this valued servant are expressed yet more\r\nfrequently in letters which I may not quote, to more domestic friends.\r\nAs to \"Mary Anne,\" she has travelled a long way while in delicate\r\nhealth, to see me, to tell me all she could of her mistress, and to\r\nexpress how glad she was \"to know of anything being done to make Miss\r\nMartineau's goodness better understood.\" \"Mary Anne\" is now a married\r\nwoman. She was engaged for three or four years before Miss Martineau's\r\ndeath, but would not leave her mistress in her old age and her\r\nill-health. That mistress, on her part, when told of the engagement,\r\nnot only admitted the lover to an interview with herself, but even\r\ngenerously urged that the wedding should not be delayed for her sake,\r\nalthough at this time she had an almost morbid shrinking from\r\nstrangers, and the loss of the personal attendant who knew her ways,\r\nwould have been one of the greatest calamities of the commoner order\r\nthat could have befallen her. But \"Mary Anne\" did not leave her; and\r\nwhen, at last, it became quite certain that death was at hand, the\r\ngenerous lady said to a relative that it made her \"so glad to think\r\nthat, when it was over, there could be nothing to stand in the way of\r\nMary Anne's marriage.\" I have thus anticipated in order to show that\r\nthe domestic peace which existed under her household rule was no\r\nspecial thing dependent upon the character of a single servant, but\r\nwas maintained through all the years of her home life, and therefore\r\nunquestionably was the result of the mistress's qualities of heart and\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nWhat may be called her external home-life--that is to say, what she\r\nwas to her poorer neighbors--during that ten years of activity, may\r\nalso be best noticed before the mental progress and literary work of\r\nthe period come under further review.\r\n\r\nEvery winter, for several years, she gave a course of lectures to the\r\nworking-people and tradesfolk of the place, in the Methodist\r\nschool-room at the back of her house. Many of the gentry desired to\r\nattend, but she would have none of them, on the double ground that\r\nthere was no room for them, and that the lectures were designed for\r\npeople who had little access to books or other educational resources.\r\nThe subjects that she treated were as various as those of her books,\r\nbut all chosen with what I have previously observed seems to me to\r\nhave been the object of all her works--to influence conduct through\r\nknowledge and reasoning. There was a course on sanitary matters,\r\nothers on her travels (and we know from her books on the same topics\r\nfrom what point of view these were treated), some on the history of\r\nEngland, another on the history and constitution of the United States;\r\nand, finally, the last course for which she had health and strength\r\nwas given in November and December, 1854, and was on the Crimean War\r\nand the character of the government of Russia.\r\n\r\nI have seen some of the older inhabitants of Ambleside who attended\r\nthese lectures, and who now speak of them in the warmest terms of\r\nadmiration. \"They were so clear; and she never stopped for a word; and\r\nso interesting!--one could have listened to them over and over again.\"\r\nBut there is no one who could tell, with the aid of a cultivated\r\ntaste, what she was as a public speaker. So eloquent is some of her\r\nwriting that one holds one's breath as one reads it; and the evident\r\nrapidity of the penmanship of her MS.[15] shows that such passages were\r\nproduced with all the improvisatory impulse and flow of the orator.\r\nIf, besides this, her delivery was fervent and impressive, one cannot\r\nbut think how great a statesman and parliamentary leader she might\r\nhave been, with these essential qualifications for modern public life\r\nadded to all that knowledge, judgment, strength of principle, and\r\npolitical capacity which made men willing (as we shall see soon) to\r\naccept her as their political teacher in the daily and quarterly\r\npress. That she had the orator's stirring gifts, the personal\r\nmagnetism which compels the minds of a mass to move with the words of\r\na speaker, and the reciprocal power of receiving stimulus from an\r\naudience, when\r\n\r\n    The hearts of many fires the lips of one,\r\n\r\nthere is one shadowy incident left to show, besides the testimony of\r\nher local hearers who survive. It is this: in 1849 Charlotte Bronte,\r\nthen in the first flush of her fame, sought Harriet Martineau's\r\nacquaintance, saying that she desired \"to see one whose works have so\r\noften made her the subject of my thoughts.\" In the following year\r\nCharlotte visited Harriet at \"The Knoll,\" and heard one of the English\r\nHistory lectures. Her bright eyes were fixed on the lecturer all\r\nthrough; and as Harriet stood on her low platform, while the audience\r\ndispersed, she heard Charlotte say, in the very voice of the lecturer,\r\nwhat Edward said in the wind-mill at Cressy: \"Is my son dead?\" They\r\nwalked silently to the house together--about three hundred paces--and\r\nwhen Harriet turned up her lamp in the drawing-room, the first thing\r\nshe saw was Charlotte looking at her with wide, shining eyes, and\r\nrepeating, in the same tone, \"Is my son dead?\" To those who know the\r\ndramatic quality of Charlotte Bronte's imagination, there is a beam of\r\nlight reflected from this trifling anecdote upon the force and the\r\nmanner of the speaker who had so impressed her.\r\n\r\n          [15] In speaking of her eloquent writings I refer specially\r\n          to the _History of the Peace_; and I have seen the\r\n          manuscript of this, bearing evidence that the hand could not\r\n          keep pace with the flow of words and thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe opinion which this keenly observant and candid woman formed of\r\nHarriet Martineau is of peculiar interest, and, as it specially refers\r\nto the period and the relations of which we are now treating, I quote\r\nit from Mrs. Gaskell's _Life of Charlotte Bronte_. It is given in\r\nsome private letters, written from \"The Knoll\" (not, as Mrs. Chapman\r\nabsurdly says, to Emily Bronte, who was dead, but) to Charlotte's\r\nlife-long and most confidential friend, Miss Ellen Nussey:--\r\n\r\n    \"I am at Miss Martineau's for a week. Her house is very pleasant\r\n    both within and without; arranged at all points with admirable\r\n    neatness and comfort. Her visitors enjoy the most perfect liberty;\r\n    what she claims for herself she allows them.... She is a great and\r\n    good woman.... The manner in which she combines the highest mental\r\n    culture with the nicest discharge of feminine duties filled me\r\n    with admiration; while her affectionate kindness earned my\r\n    gratitude. I think her good and noble qualities far outweigh her\r\n    defects. It is my habit to consider the individual apart from his\r\n    (or her) reputation, practice independent of theory, natural\r\n    disposition isolated from acquired opinion. Harriet Martineau's\r\n    person, practice, and character inspire me with the truest\r\n    affection and respect.\r\n\r\n    \"I find a worth and greatness in herself, and a consistency and\r\n    benevolence and perseverance in her practice, such as win the\r\n    sincerest esteem and affection. She is not a person to be judged\r\n    by her writings alone, but rather by her own deeds and life, than\r\n    which nothing can be more exemplary or nobler. She seems to me the\r\n    benefactress of Ambleside, yet takes no sort of credit to herself\r\n    for her active and indefatigable philanthropy. The government of\r\n    her household is admirably administered; all she does is well\r\n    done, from the writing of a history down to the quietest feminine\r\n    occupation. No sort of carelessness or neglect is allowed under\r\n    her rule, and yet she is not over-strict, or too rigidly exacting;\r\n    her servants and her poor neighbors love as well as respect her.\r\n\r\n    \"I must not, however, fall into the error of talking too much\r\n    about her, merely because my mind is just now deeply impressed\r\n    with what I have seen of her intellectual power and moral worth.\"\r\n\r\nSome of her lectures were given with the express object of inducing\r\nthe people to form a building society. Rents were excessively high for\r\nthe working classes from the scarcity of cottages; and therefore they\r\nlived and slept crowded together, while the open country extended all\r\naround them. The moral screw was turned upon them, too, about politics\r\nand religion, by the threat of the landlord that, if they offended\r\nhim, he would turn them out of the only cottages they could get. With\r\nthat true philanthropy which her studies in political economy had\r\ntaught, Miss Martineau went to work to aid the people to improve their\r\nown condition. She obtained a loan of L500 from her old friend, Mrs.\r\nReid, of London (to whom the foundation of Bedford college is mainly\r\ndue), with which she purchased a field just above the village at\r\nEllercross, and parcelled it out, drained it, and made the road. Then,\r\nby her lectures, she showed the people how they could \"buy a house\r\nwith its rent\"; and she undertook all the infinite trouble that\r\ndevolved upon her when the society was formed, as the only member of\r\nit with legal and general knowledge, and, therefore, the only one able\r\nto guide its affairs. Before me there lies a package of the notes that\r\nshe sent at different times on this business to Mr. Bell, the\r\nAmbleside chemist, who was the nominal chairman--though she was the\r\nreal one--of the society. \"Jealousy and ridicule went to work against\r\nthe scheme\"; but her philanthropic energy and wisdom were fully\r\nsuccessful. The cottages are healthily planned and well built, and\r\nremain there as a monument to the efforts which she made for the good\r\nof her poor neighbors.\r\n\r\nBesides these more general undertakings for their benefit, there yet\r\nlive many amongst them who are grateful to her for personal kindness\r\nand assistance. While her strength lasted, she was ever ready to try\r\nto relieve others from illness by the means which she believed to have\r\ncured herself; and seven mesmerized patients were sometimes asleep at\r\none time in her drawing-room. She was a powerful mesmerist. Most of\r\nher patients were at least relieved--some cured. A present resident of\r\nAmbleside, who owes his success in business life to her kindness, told\r\nme how she mesmerized him for nearly an hour every day for a year; and\r\nto show that she did not do this without very decided results to\r\nherself, he remembers that her fingers used to swell during the\r\nprocess, so as to almost hide her rings, if she forgot to take them\r\noff before beginning.\r\n\r\nAgain, her library was placed freely at the service of deserving young\r\nmen in the village, and only book-lovers will be able to appreciate\r\nthe generosity of this neighborly kindness. Old Miss Nicholson tells\r\nme of Miss Martineau's kindness to her invalid sister; sharing with\r\nher the luxuries which were not to be bought in Ambleside, but which\r\nthe famous writer frequently received from some of her many friends.\r\nNor was the mere personal human sympathy wanting in her; those who\r\nneeded no gifts or material aid from her knew her as a kind friend,\r\nready to think for them and advise with them in their troubles or\r\nperplexities.\r\n\r\nIn mentioning her activities other than literary, during those ten\r\nbusy and healthy years of home life, I must not omit her\r\n\"farming\"--her farm of two acres. She had no intention, at first, of\r\nembarking in such an enterprise. She let on hire that portion of her\r\nland which she did not wish to have in her garden, and her maids and\r\nherself, with the occasional help of a man, kept the garden in order.\r\nBut this plan did not answer well. The tenant allowed the grass to get\r\nuntidy, and his sheep broke into the garden to eat the cabbages.\r\nNeither the vegetable nor the flower garden could be kept so nicely as\r\nmight be wished. Milk, butter, eggs, and hams, all had to be bought at\r\nhigh prices; and so small was the supply at times that these articles\r\nof country produce were actually unattainable by purchase.\r\n\r\nThe energetic lady of the small domain was profoundly dissatisfied\r\nwith this state of affairs. So to work she went to study the science\r\nof agriculture and practical farming; and soon a Norfolk laborer was\r\nestablished on her land, and this small farm was under her own\r\nmanagement. She set up a cross-pole fence around her estate, the first\r\none ever seen in the Lake District; and, like a true woman, she\r\nplanted roses all along the fence, to wreathe and decorate it in\r\nsummer. Then she initiated her fellow-farmers into the mysteries of\r\nhigh farming, and stall feeding. \"A cow to three acres\" was the Lake\r\nrule; but she hired another half-acre of land, to add to her own, and\r\nshowed that upon this total of two acres she could _almost_ keep two\r\ncows. Fowls and pigs were, of course, kept also; and all the household\r\ncomforts which cows, hens, and pigs supply were obtained from her land\r\nat, practically, no cost at all. The subsistence of the laborer and\r\nhis wife was created out of the soil; and the house had a constant\r\nsupply of vegetables, milk, eggs, and hams, at a less expense than\r\nbuying had previously been, and with a much nicer and always certain\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nThe experiment became famous in a small way. \"People came to see how\r\nwe arranged our ground, so as to get such crops out of it,\"[16] and one\r\nof the Poor-Law Commissioners, having asked her for a private account\r\nof how she had managed her little farm, printed her letter in the\r\n_Times_, without asking her consent. This brought such a flood of\r\ncorrespondence on her that she was compelled to write on the subject\r\nfor publication, and so the farm superintendence resulted in a piece\r\nof literary work for the mistress.\r\n\r\n          [16] _Health, Husbandry and Handicraft_, p. 269, \"Our\r\n          Farm of Two Acres.\"\r\n\r\nNow we will see what her pen was doing while all these activities were\r\nhelping to fill her days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nIN THE MATURITY OF HER POWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe book, published early in 1848, in which Harriet described her\r\nEgyptian, Desert and Palestine travels, was entitled _Eastern Life,\r\nPast and Present_. If I were required to give from some one only of\r\nher works a series of extracts which should illustrate the special\r\npowers of her mind and the finest features of her style, it would be\r\nthis book that I should choose. I do not mean to say that the most\r\neloquent and vivid passage that I might find in all her writings is\r\nhere; nor that her deepest and noblest qualities as a thinker are more\r\nforcibly displayed here than elsewhere. But I mean that in _Eastern\r\nLife, Past and Present_, all her best moral and intellectual\r\nfaculties were exerted, and their action becomes visible, at one page\r\nor another, in reading the book from the first to the last chapters.\r\nThe keen observation, the active thought, the vigorous memory, the\r\npower of deep and sustained study, the mastery of language, giving the\r\nability to depict in words and to arouse the reader's imagination to\r\nmental vision--all these requisites for the writing of a good book of\r\ntravel she showed that she possessed. But there is even more than all\r\nthis in _Eastern Life_. There is the feeling for humanity in all\r\nits circumstances, which can sympathize no less with the slave of the\r\nharem at this moment alive in degradation, than with the highest\r\nintelligences that ceased from existence unnumbered thousands of years\r\nago. The most interesting and characteristic feature distinguishing\r\nthis work is, however, the openness and freedom of its thought\r\ncombined with the profound reverence that it shows for all that is\r\nvenerable.\r\n\r\nIt was _Eastern Life_ which first declared to the world that Harriet\r\nMartineau had ceased to have a theology. She had learned in travelling\r\nthrough Egypt, how much of what Moses taught was derived from the\r\nancient mythology of Egypt. Passing afterwards through the lands where\r\nthe Hebrew, the Christian, and the Mohammedan faiths in turn arose,\r\nobserving, thinking, and studying, the conclusion at which she arrived\r\nat last was, in brief, this: That men have ever constructed the image\r\nof a Ruler of the Universe out of their own minds; that all successive\r\nideas about the Supreme Power have been originated from within, and\r\nmodified by the surrounding circumstances; and that all theologies,\r\ntherefore, are baseless productions of the human imagination, and have\r\nno essential connection with those great religious ideas and emotions\r\nby which men are constrained to live nobly, to do justly, and to love\r\nwhat they see to be the true and the right.\r\n\r\nHer conviction that the highest moral conduct, and the most unselfish\r\ngoodness, and the noblest aspirations, are in no degree connected with\r\nany kind of creed, was aided and supported, no doubt, by her warm\r\npersonal affection for Mr. Atkinson, and some other of her friends of\r\nhis way of thinking, in whom she found aspirations as lofty and\r\nfeelings as admirable as ever she had enjoyed communion with, together\r\nwith a complete rejection, on scientific grounds, of all theology. Her\r\nbelief now was that--\r\n\r\n    The best state of mind was to be found, however it might be\r\n    accounted for, in those who were called philosophical atheists....\r\n    I knew several of that class--some avowed, and some not; and I had\r\n    for several years felt that they were among my most honored\r\n    acquaintances and friends; and now I knew them more deeply and\r\n    thoroughly, I must say that, for conscientiousness, sincerity,\r\n    integrity, seriousness, effective intellect, _and the true\r\n    religious spirit_, I knew nothing like them.\r\n\r\nHer own \"true religious\" earnestness was unabated. _Eastern Life_\r\ncontains abundance of evidence that the spirit in which she now wrote\r\nagainst all theological systems was exactly at one with that in which\r\nshe had twenty years before written _Addresses, Prayers and Hymns_.\r\nHer intellectual range had become far wider; her knowledge of human\r\nnature and of the history and conditions of mankind had vastly\r\nincreased; but her religious earnestness--that is to say, her devotion\r\nto truth, and her emotional reverence for her highest conceptions of\r\ngoodness and duty--was as fervent as ever.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the boldness and heterodoxy of _Eastern Life_, it did\r\nnot cause much outcry; and her two next books were amongst the most\r\nsuccessful of all her works. The first of these was _Household\r\nEducation_; the second, _A History of the Thirty Years' Peace_.\r\n\r\nThe former was partly written for periodical publication during 1847\r\nin the _People's Journal_, for which magazine she wrote also a few\r\ndesultory articles.\r\n\r\nThe _History of the Peace_ was a voluminous work of the first order of\r\nimportance. Its execution is in most respects entirely admirable. Her\r\ntask of writing the history of the time in which she had herself lived\r\nwas one of extreme delicacy. Honest contemporary judgments about\r\nstill-living or lately-dead persons, and about actions which have been\r\nobserved with all the freshness of feeling of the passing moment, must\r\noften seem unduly stern to those who look back through the softening\r\nveil of the past, and to whom the actors have always been purely\r\nhistoric personages. Moreover, I have before mentioned her tendency,\r\nwhich seems to me to have arisen from her deafness, to give\r\ninsufficient _shading off_ in depicting character. But wonderfully\r\nlittle allowance is, after all, required on such grounds from the\r\nreader at the present day of Harriet Martineau's history of the years\r\nbetween 1815 and 1845. The view taken by her of O'Connell, Brougham,\r\nand some others is perhaps too stern; the picture has too many dark\r\nshades, and not a due proportion of light tints; but it can scarcely\r\nbe questioned that the outline is accurate, and the whole drawing\r\nsubstantially correct. The earnest endeavor after impartiality, and\r\nthe success with which the judicial attitude of the historian is on\r\nthe whole maintained, are very remarkable.\r\n\r\nThis appears so to one who looks upon the book with the eyes of the\r\npresent generation; but the recognition of the fact at the moment when\r\nshe wrote is perhaps more conclusive, and the following quotation may\r\nserve to show the opinion of those who (with her) had lived through\r\nthe time of which she treats.\r\n\r\n    Miss Martineau has been able to discuss events which may almost be\r\n    called contemporary as calmly as if she were examining a remote\r\n    period of antiquity. She has written the history of a rather\r\n    undignified reign with a dignity that raises even the strifes of\r\n    forgotten and exploded parties into philosophic importance. She\r\n    exhibits warm sympathies for all that is noble, honorable, or\r\n    exalted--and a thorough disdain of every paltry contrivance\r\n    devised to serve a temporary purpose, or gain an unworthy end. The\r\n    principles which she enunciates are based on eternal truths, and\r\n    evolved with a logical precision that admits rhetorical ornament\r\n    without becoming obscure or confused. There are few living authors\r\n    who may be so implicitly trusted with the task of writing\r\n    contemporary history as Miss Martineau. She has spared no pains in\r\n    investigating the truth, and allowed no fears to prevent her from\r\n    stating it.[17]\r\n\r\n          [17] _Athenaeum_, March, 31st, 1849.\r\n\r\nThough all her other books should die, and be buried utterly under the\r\ndust of time, this one will never be entirely lost. It is as accurate\r\nand as careful in its facts as the driest compendium, while yet its\r\npages glow with eloquence, and are instinct with political wisdom. She\r\nreally did here what she had designed to do in _Society in America_;\r\nbut here she did it in the right method, there in a wrong one. The\r\ngreat growth of her mind in twelve years of maturity could not be\r\nbetter gauged than by a comparison of these two works. Her political\r\nprinciples did not change in the time; she was a true believer in\r\npopular government all her life--her love of justice caused her to be\r\na hater of class rule, and of every kind of privilege; her sympathies\r\nwere boundless, and made her in earnest for the freedom and progress\r\nof the democracy; her conscience was active so that she loved truth\r\nfor its own sake; and her sense of duty never failed to keep alive in\r\nher large mind a feeling of personal concern in the progress of public\r\naffairs. All this was true of her when she wrote her American book; it\r\nwas equally true when she treated the history of her own land and her\r\nown times. But in the latter case, she writes on political philosophy\r\nlike a statesman--in the former there is much of the doctrinaire. In\r\nthe latter work, principles underlie the whole fabric; but the actions\r\nof politicians are made the means of judging their own professed\r\ncreeds, the value of those creeds being easily appraised by the\r\nresults seen to follow on actions in conformity with them. In the\r\nearlier work, as we saw, the theories were postulated first, and the\r\nactions were measured against those self-derived standards of right\r\nand wrong. For political sagacity, for nobility of public spirit, for\r\neffective thought, for knowledge of facts, for clear presentation of\r\nthem, for accuracy in judging of their permanent importance, for\r\ncandor, and impartiality, for insight into character, and for vivid\r\nand glowing eloquence, _The History of the Thirty Years' Peace_ stands\r\nforth unmatched amongst books of its class. This, I take it, will be\r\nthe most enduring and valuable of all her works, and the one by which\r\nchiefly posterity will learn what were her powers and how estimable\r\nwas her character.\r\n\r\nIn the two works last mentioned, _Eastern Life_ and _The Thirty\r\nYears' Peace_, it seems to me that she touched the high-water mark\r\nof her permanent achievements. We have nearly reached the end of the\r\nlong catalogue of her books, though by no means the end of her\r\nwritings. Very much more work she did in her life, as will presently\r\nbe told, but it was that kind of work which is (with the single\r\nexception of oratory) the most powerful at the moment, but the most\r\nevanescent--journalism. She was soon to begin to apply her ripe wisdom\r\nand her life-long study of the theory of government to the concrete\r\nproblems of practical politics. The influence of an active and\r\npowerful journalist cannot be measured; the work itself cannot be\r\nadequately surveyed and criticized; and thus what is, perhaps, the\r\nmost useful, capable and important work which Harriet Martineau did,\r\neludes our detailed survey. We can best judge what was her power as a\r\nleader-writer and review and magazine essayist by noting how\r\nprogressively her mind improved, and to what a high moral and\r\nintellectual standpoint she had attained in her latest volumes, just\r\nbefore she exchanged such sustained labors for the briefer though not\r\nless arduous efforts of leading and teaching through the periodical\r\npress.\r\n\r\n_The History of the Peace_ was completed in 1850, and was so\r\nimmediately successful that the publisher asked Miss Martineau to\r\nwrite an introductory volume on the history of the first fifteen years\r\nof this century. While at work upon this \"Introduction\" she did also\r\nsome short articles on various subjects for Charles Dickens'\r\nperiodical, _Household Words_, and was likewise proceeding with the\r\npreparation of another volume of a very different kind. This last was\r\npublished in January, 1851 (before the introductory volume of the\r\n_History_), under the title of _Letters on the Laws of Man's Nature\r\nand Development_, by Henry George Atkinson, F.G.S., and Harriet\r\nMartineau.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the book were actual letters which had passed between\r\nthe friends. It will be remembered that Harriet did not meet Mr.\r\nAtkinson during the progress of her mesmeric treatment and recovery\r\nfrom illness under his written advice. But soon after she got better,\r\nthey were visiting together at the house of a cousin of hers, and\r\nduring the six years or so which had since then passed, they had often\r\nmet, and their correspondence had grown to be very frequent. Mr.\r\nAtkinson had gradually become the friend dearest to Harriet Martineau\r\nin all the world. He gained her affection (I use the word advisedly)\r\nby entirely honorable roads--by the delight which she took in\r\nobserving his scientific knowledge, his originality of thought and his\r\nelevated tone of mind. But I cannot doubt that long before this volume\r\nof _Letters_ was published, he had become dear to her by virtue\r\nof that personal attraction which is not altogether dependent upon\r\nmerit, but which enhances such merits as may be possessed by the\r\nobject of the attachment, and somewhat confuses the relationship on\r\nthe intellectual side. This condition of things is in no way\r\nespecially feminine; John Stuart Mill bowed down to Mrs. Taylor, and\r\nComte erected his admiration of Clotilde into a _culte_. Mr.\r\nAtkinson was many years younger than his friend, and very likely she\r\nnever fully realized the depth of her own feelings towards him. But\r\nstill the attraction had its influence, though unacknowledged in\r\nwords, and unreciprocated in kind.\r\n\r\nMiss Martineau was really taught by Mr. Atkinson much of science that\r\nshe had not previously studied; but yet it was an error, from every\r\npoint of view, for her to present to the world a book in which she\r\navowed herself his pupil. Her letters are mainly composed of\r\nquestions, upon which she seeks enlightenment. The answers cannot, in\r\nthe nature of the case, give forth a connected system of thought upon\r\n\"Man's Nature and Development.\" No one was more ready than she herself\r\nto recognize that, as she says, \"in literature, no mind can work well\r\nupon the lines laid down by another\"; yet this was what she required\r\nMr. Atkinson to do in replying to her questions and taking up her\r\npoints. The errors that one would expect are found in the results of\r\nthis mistaken form; the facts and the inferences are neither\r\nsufficiently separated, nor properly connected; and the real value\r\nwhich the book had as a contribution to science and philosophy is lost\r\nsight of in the disorder. In fact, no form could be less suitable than\r\nthe epistolary for such work--either for the writers to arrange and\r\nanalyze what they were doing, or for the reader to see and understand\r\nwhat they have done. Besides this, the public had long consented to\r\nlearn from Harriet Martineau; but Mr. Atkinson, though highly\r\nrespected by his own circle, was not known to the general public, and\r\nit was therefore an error in policy for Miss Martineau to show herself\r\nsitting as a pupil at his feet, and to call on those who believed in\r\nher to believe in him as her teacher and guide. Her fine tact and long\r\nexperience must have led her to perceive all this in an ordinary case;\r\nand only the personal reason of a desire to win for her friend the\r\nrecognition from the public which she herself had already given him so\r\nfully in her own head and heart, could have led an experienced and\r\nable woman of letters to so blunder in her selection of the literary\r\nform of the book.\r\n\r\nAs to the substance of the _Letters_, but little need be said, because\r\nthe bulk of the volume is not her writing, but Mr. Atkinson's. The\r\nideas which she had then accepted, however, were those by which she\r\nlived the rest of her life, and must have their due share of notice\r\nfor that reason.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental point in the book is its insistance on the Baconian,\r\nor experiential, or scientific, method of inquiry being adopted in\r\nstudying man and his mental constitution, just as much as in studying\r\ninanimate nature. A great First Cause of all things is not denied, but\r\ndeclared unknown and unknowable, as necessarily beyond the\r\ncomprehension of the senses of man. Supernatural revelation is, of\r\ncourse, entirely rejected; indeed, the very word supernatural is held\r\nto involve a fallacy, for only natural things can be known. Mr.\r\nAtkinson pointed out that the whole of the facts which are around us\r\ncan be observed, analyzed, and found to occur in an invariable\r\nsequence of causes and effects, which form natural laws; and that the\r\nmind of man is no exception to this general truth, that all events\r\nspring from causes, and are themselves in turn causes of other\r\neffects. It follows from these conclusions that the \"First Cause\"\r\n(which, as Miss Martineau said, the constitution of the human mind\r\nrequires it to suppose) never intervenes in the world as an errant\r\ninfluence, disturbing natural law; and all speculations about its\r\nnature, character, and purposes are put aside as out of the field of\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nPassing on from method to results, Mr. Atkinson gave the first hints\r\nof many doctrines now fully accepted: as that of unconscious\r\ncerebration, or that of more senses than five, for instance; and many\r\nothers (based mainly on phrenology and mesmerism) not held, up to the\r\npresent time, even by the scientists of his own school. For the rest\r\nthe book has much that is interesting; it has much that is true; but\r\nit has, also, much that might well have been put forward as\r\nspeculation, but should not have been stated so dogmatically as it was\r\non the evidence available.[18]\r\n\r\n          [18] It is right that I should say that I alone am\r\n          responsible for the above (necessarily imperfect) digest of\r\n          the contents of the book. I at first thought of asking Mr.\r\n          Atkinson to do me the favor of reading my account of his work\r\n          in proof; but I ultimately concluded that it would be better\r\n          that in this instance, as in the case of all Harriet\r\n          Martineau's other books, I myself should be wholly\r\n          responsible to the public for my own substantial accuracy\r\n          and fairness.\r\n\r\nIt was received in 1851 with a howl from the orthodox press which\r\nwould seem strange indeed in these days. But of competent criticism it\r\nhad very little. Miss Martineau's name, of course, secured attention\r\nfor it; and small though her share in the book was, it was quite\r\nenough to make the fact perfectly clear that she was henceforth to be\r\nlooked upon as a \"materialist\" and a \"philosophical atheist,\" and the\r\nrest of the names by which it was customary to stigmatize any person\r\nwho rejected supernaturalism and revelation.\r\n\r\nThe motives with which this book was written and published could\r\nhardly be misunderstood. There could be no idea of making money out of\r\na work on philosophy--even if either of the authors had been in the\r\nhabit of writing merely to make money; while as to fame and applause,\r\neveryone is more or less acquainted with the history of the reception\r\ngiven in all ages to those who have questioned the popular beliefs of\r\ntheir time! The sole motive with which Harriet Martineau wrote and\r\nissued this book was the same that impelled her to do all her\r\nwork--the desire to teach that which she believed to be true, and to\r\nbe valuable in its influence upon conduct. With regard to the latter\r\npoint, it seemed to her that one great cause for the slow advance of\r\ncivilization is the degree to which good men and women have occupied\r\nthemselves with supernatural concerns, neglecting for these the actual\r\nworld, its conditions, and its wants, and giving themselves over to\r\nthe guidance of a spiritual hierarchy instead of exercising all their\r\nown powers in freedom. She struck at this error in publishing the\r\n_Letters_. At the same time she felt doubtful if her future writings\r\nwould ever be read after her bold utterances, and even, as the\r\nfollowing letter shows, whether she might not find herself the\r\noccupant of a felon's dock for the crime of which Socrates, and Jesus,\r\nand Galileo were each in turn accused--blasphemy:\r\n\r\n    LETTER TO MR. ATKINSON.\r\n\r\n    [Extract.]\r\n    August 10, 1874.\r\n\r\n    One thing more is worth saying. Do you remember how, when we were\r\n    bringing out our \"Letters,\" I directed your attention to our\r\n    Blasphemy Law, and the trial of Moxon, under that law, for\r\n    publishing Shelley's \"Queen Mab\" among his _Poems_? You ridiculed\r\n    my statement, and said Mr. Procter[19] denied there being such a\r\n    law, or Moxon having been tried, in the face of the fact that I\r\n    had corresponded with Moxon on the occasion, on the part of\r\n    certain personal friends. The fact appeared afterwards in the\r\n    _Annual Register_, but it seemed to produce no effect. Well, now\r\n    you can know the truth by looking at the _Life of Denman_, by Sir\r\n    Joseph Arnould. If you can lay your hands on the book, please look\r\n    at vol. ii. p. 129, where there is an account of the trial, Judge\r\n    Denman being the judge who tried the case. The narrative ends\r\n    thus:--\"The verdict was for the Crown\" (conviction for blasphemy),\r\n    \"but Mr. Moxon was never called up for sentence.\" It is too late\r\n    for Mr. Procter to learn the truth, but it is surely always well\r\n    for us, while still engaged in the work of life, to be accurately\r\n    informed on such matters as the laws we live under, and our\r\n    consequent responsibilities. Is it not so?\r\n\r\n          [19] \"Barry Cornwall.\"\r\n\r\nIt was, then, with the full anticipation, not only of social obloquy,\r\nbut also of legal penalty, that the brave thinker fulfilled (to quote\r\nher own words in the preface to the _Letters_) \"that great social\r\nduty, to impart what we believe, and what we think we have learned.\r\nAmong the few things of which we can pronounce ourselves certain is\r\nthe obligation of inquirers after truth to communicate what they\r\nobtain.\" The heroic soul fulfilled now, as before and afterwards, what\r\nshe held to be her duty, as simply and unwaveringly as ever a soldier\r\non the battlefield charged the cannon's mouth.\r\n\r\nFive times in her life did Harriet Martineau write and publish that\r\nwhich she believed would ruin her prospects, silence her voice for\r\never, and close her career. Far from her was that common paltering\r\nwith the conscience by which so many men confuse their minds--the poor\r\npretence that truth must not be spoken for fear that the speaker's\r\ninfluence for future worthy work may be injured by his boldness. This\r\nis how the devil tempts, saying, \"Fall down, and worship me, and I\r\nwill give thee all the kingdoms of the earth and the glory of them.\"\r\nHarriet Martineau never worshipped evil even by silence, when silence\r\nwas sin, playing fast and loose with her conscience by a promise to\r\nuse the power so obtained for higher objects hereafter. The truth that\r\nappeared to her mind she spoke frankly; the work that was placed for\r\nher to do she did simply; and so the quagmire of the expedient never\r\nengulfed her reputation, her self-respect and her usefulness, as it\r\nhas done that of so many who have been lured into it from the straight\r\npath of right action and truthful speech in public life, by\r\nwill-o'-the-wisp hopes of greater power and glory for themselves in\r\nthe future--which they hope they may use for good when they shall be\r\nsmothered in cowardice and lies. She had much to suffer, and did\r\nsuffer. Martyrs are not honored because they are insensate, but\r\nbecause they defy their natural human weaknesses in maintaining that\r\nwhich they believe to be true. Probably the keenest grief which she\r\nexperienced on the occasion now before us came from the complete\r\nseparation which took place between her and the dearest friend of her\r\nyouth, her brother James. Dr. Martineau was, at that time, one of the\r\neditors of the _Prospective Review_. Philosophy was his department,\r\nand in the natural order the _Letters_ came to him for review. He\r\nreviewed the book accordingly and in such terms that all intercourse\r\nbetween him and his sister was thenceforward at an end. They had long\r\nbefore drifted apart in thought; but this final separation was none\r\nthe less felt as a wrench. Dr. Martineau's attack was almost\r\nexclusively aimed against Mr. Atkinson. But with Harriet's loyalty of\r\nnature she was more impelled to resent what was said about her friend\r\nand colleague than if it had been directed against herself. The\r\nbrother and sister never met or communicated with each other again.\r\n\r\nThe introductory volume of the _History of the Peace_ was published\r\nsoon after the Atkinson _Letters_. The next work which she undertook\r\nwas a great labor--the rendering into English of Comte's _Positive\r\nPhilosophy_.\r\n\r\nWhat she accomplished with this book was not a mere translation, nor\r\ncould it be precisely described as a condensation; it was both these\r\nand more. Comte had propounded his groundwork of philosophy and his\r\noutline of all the sciences in six bulky volumes, full of repetitions,\r\nand written in an imperfect French style. Harriet Martineau rendered\r\nthe whole substance of these six volumes into two of clear English,\r\norderly, consecutive, and scientific in method as in substance. So\r\nwell was her work accomplished that Comte himself adopted it for his\r\nstudents' use, removing from his list of books for Positivists his own\r\nedition of his course, and recommending instead the English version by\r\nMiss Martineau. It thus by-and-bye came to pass that Comte's own work\r\nfell entirely out of use, and his complete teachings became\r\ninaccessible to the French people in their own tongue; so that twenty\r\nyears afterwards, when one of his disciples wished to call public\r\nattention to the master's work as teaching the method of social\r\nscience by which the French nation must find its way back to\r\nprosperity after the great war, he was constrained to ask Harriet\r\nMartineau's permission to re-translate her version.\r\n\r\nComte wrote her the warmest expressions of his gratitude; but this he\r\nowed her on another ground besides the one of the value of her labors\r\nin popularizing his work so ably. While she was laboring at her task,\r\nMr. Lombe, then High Sheriff of Norfolk, sent her a cheque for L500,\r\nwhich he begged her to accept, since she was doing a work which he had\r\nlong desired to see accomplished, but which he knew could not possibly\r\nbe remunerative to her. She accepted the money, but with her customary\r\ngenerosity in pecuniary affairs, she employed more than half of it in\r\npaying the whole expenses of publication, and arranged that the\r\nproceeds of the sale, whatever they might be, should be shared with M.\r\nComte.\r\n\r\nThere was a considerable demand for the work on its first appearance;\r\nand up to this present date a fair number of copies is annually\r\ndisposed of. It came out in November, 1853, having partly occupied her\r\ntime during the preceding two years. Only partly, however; for,\r\nbesides all the efforts for her neighborhood previously referred to\r\n(the building society was in progress during those years, and gave her\r\nmuch thought, as her business notes are in evidence), and besides her\r\nfarming, she was now writing largely for periodicals and newspapers.\r\nThese are the pulpits from which our modern preachers are most widely\r\nand effectively heard, and the right tone of which is, therefore, of\r\nthe first consequence to society. For every hundred persons who listen\r\nto the priest, the journalist (including in this term writers for all\r\nperiodicals) speaks to a thousand; and while the words of the one are\r\noften heard merely as a formality, those of the other, dealing with\r\nthe matters at the moment most near and interesting to his audience,\r\nmay effectively influence the thoughts and consciences and actions of\r\nthousands in the near future. Shallow, indeed, would be the mind which\r\nundervalued the power of the journalist, or underrated the seriousness\r\nof his vocation.\r\n\r\nHarriet Martineau saw the scope which journalism afforded for the kind\r\nof work which she had all her life been doing--the influencing of\r\nconduct by considering practical affairs in the light of principle.\r\nHer periodical writing being, according to our mistaken English\r\ncustom, anonymous, neither brought her any increase of fame nor\r\ncarried with it the influence which her personality as a teacher would\r\nhave contributed to the weight of what she wrote. Nevertheless, she\r\nrepeatedly in her letters, speaks of her journalism as the most\r\ndelightful work of her life, and that which she believed had been\r\nperhaps the most useful of all her efforts.\r\n\r\nSome stories with sanitary morals, which she now contributed to\r\n_Household Words_, were admirably written. \"The People of Bleaburn\" is\r\nthe true story of what was done by a grand American woman, Mary Ware,\r\nwhen she happened to go into an isolated village at the very time\r\nthat half its inhabitants were lying stricken down by an epidemic.\r\n\"Woodruffe, the Gardener,\" was a presentation of the evils of living\r\nin low-lying damp countries. \"The Marsh Fog and the Sea Breeze\" is\r\nperhaps the most interesting of all her stories since the Political\r\nEconomy tales, which it much resembles in lightness of touch and in\r\npractical utility.\r\n\r\nA series of slight stories under the general title of \"Sketches from\r\nLife,\" was also contributed at this time to the _Leader_; they\r\nwere all of them true tales and, like most real life stories,\r\nextremely pathetic. The most touching is one called \"The Old\r\nGoverness,\" describing the feelings with which an educated elderly\r\nwoman, past her work, and with an injured hand, sought refuge in the\r\nworkhouse; and how she conducted herself there. These stories were\r\nrepublished in a volume in 1856.\r\n\r\nA series of descriptive accounts of manufactures, some of which\r\ncontain most graphic writing, were also done in this time. These\r\npapers, with others written between 1845-55, were re-published in a\r\nvolume in 1861.[20] There are some passages which I am greatly tempted\r\nto quote, merely as specimens of the perfection to which her literary\r\nstyle had at this time arrived. It is now a style of that clear\r\nsimplicity which seems so easy to the reader, but which is in reality\r\nthe highest triumph of the literary artist. The inexperienced reader\r\nis apt to suppose that anybody could write thus, until perhaps he\r\ngains some glimpse of the truth by finding the powerful effect which\r\nit is producing upon his thoughts and imagination. The practiced\r\nwriter knows meanwhile that, simple though the vocabulary appears, he\r\ncould not change a word for the better; and easily though the\r\nsentences swing, the rounding of their rhythm is an achievement to\r\nadmire. I may not pause to quote, but I may especially refer to the\r\npaper on \"The Life of a Salmon,\" in illustration of this eloquence of\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\n          [20] _Health, Husbandry and Handicraft._\r\n\r\nEarly in 1852, Harriet Martineau received an invitation from the\r\n_Daily News_ to send a \"leader\" occasionally. Busily engaged as she\r\nwas with Comte, and with work for other periodicals, she yet gladly\r\naccepted this proposition; and thus began her connection with that\r\npaper (then newly started) which was so valuable both to her and the\r\nproprietors of the _Daily News_. During the early summer of 1852, she\r\nwrote two \"leaders\" each week, and, before she had finished Comte, the\r\nregular contributions to the newspaper had grown to three a week.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1852 she made a two months' tour through Ireland; and\r\nat the request of the editor she wrote thence a descriptive letter for\r\npublication in the _Daily News_, almost every other day. The letters\r\ndescribed the state of Ireland at the moment, with observations such\r\nas few were so well qualified as she to make upon the facts. She did\r\nnow what Daniel O'Connell had entreated her to do years before. In\r\n1839 the Liberator begged her to travel through his country, and\r\nwithout bias or favor represent calmly what really was the political\r\nand social condition of Ireland.[21] The \"Letters from Ireland\"\r\nattracted immediate attention as they appeared in the _Daily News_;\r\nand before the end of the year they were re-published in a volume. At\r\nthe same time some of her \"leaders\" secured much attention, and the\r\neditor pressed her to write even more frequently. During 1853 she\r\nwrote on an average four articles a week, and shortly afterwards the\r\nnumber rose to six--one in each day's paper.\r\n\r\n          [21] It may be mentioned that a similar plea was made to her\r\n          by the Crown Prince Oscar of Sweden, who desired her aid in\r\n          preparing his people for constitutional reform; and again, at\r\n          a later date, by Count Porro, of Milan, who begged that she\r\n          would let the world know what was the condition of Italy\r\n          under Austrian rule.\r\n\r\nThe tale of the journalistic work of these busy two years is not yet\r\ncomplete. There is a long article of hers in the _Westminster Review_\r\nfor January, 1853; the subject is, \"The Condition and Prospects of\r\nIreland.\"\r\n\r\nAll this journalism was done at the same time that the heavy sustained\r\ntask of the condensation of Comte's abstruse and bulky work was\r\nproceeding. When to all this we add in our recollection her home\r\nduties, and when the fact is borne in mind that it was her common\r\npractice to take immense walks, not infrequently covering from twelve\r\nto fifteen miles in the day, it will be seen that the mere industry\r\nand energy that she showed were most extraordinary. But, besides this,\r\nher work was of a high order of literary excellence, and full of\r\nintellectual power.\r\n\r\nSuch incessant labor is not to be held up as altogether an example to\r\nbe imitated. There are some few whose duty it is to consciously\r\nmoderate the amount of labor to which their mental activity impels\r\nthem; and no one ought to allow the imperative brain to overtax the\r\nrest of the system. During the Irish journey, Harriet began to be\r\naware of experiencing unusual fatigue. She gave herself no sufficient\r\npause, however, either then or afterwards, until she could not help\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\nAfter the publication of Comte she wrote a remarkable article for the\r\n_Westminster Review_ (anonymous of course) on \"England's Foreign\r\npolicy.\" This appeared in the number for January, 1854. It dealt\r\nlargely with the impending struggle between England and Russia. True\r\nLiberal as Harriet Martineau was, she hated with all her soul, not the\r\nRussian people, but the hideous despotism, the Asiatic and barbarian\r\nand brutal government of that empire. She foresaw a probable great\r\nstruggle in the future between tyranny and freedom, in which Russia,\r\nby virtue of all her circumstances, will be the power against which\r\nthe free peoples of the earth will have to fight. Not only, then, did\r\nshe fully recognize the necessity for the immediate resistance, which\r\nthe Crimean war was, to the encroachments on Europe of the Czar, but\r\nher article also included a powerful plea for the abolition of that\r\nsystem of secrecy of English diplomacy, by which it is rendered quite\r\npossible for our ministry to covertly injure our liberties, and to\r\ntake action behind our backs in our names in opposition to our warmest\r\nwishes. The article, as a whole, is one of her most powerful pieces of\r\nwriting, and had it been delivered as a speech in parliament, it would\r\nundoubtedly have produced a great effect, and have placed her high\r\namongst the statesmen of that critical time.\r\n\r\nIn the April (1854) number of the same _Review_, there appeared an\r\narticle from her pen upon \"The Census of 1851.\" This paper was not a\r\nmere comment upon the census return, but an historical review of the\r\nprogress of the English people from barbarism to the civilization of\r\nour century.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of this year she made a careful survey of the beautiful\r\ndistrict around her home, in order to write a _Complete Guide to the\r\nLakes_ for a local publisher. She was already thoroughly acquainted\r\nwith the neighborhood by means of her long and frequent pedestrian\r\nexcursions, and reminiscences of these abound in this \"Guide.\" The\r\nvivid description of a storm on Blake Fell, for instance, is a\r\nfaithful account of an occurrence during a visit which a niece and\r\nnephew from Birmingham paid to her soon after her settlement at the\r\nlakes. The word-paintings of the scenery, too, were drawn, not from\r\nwhat she saw on one set visit only, but were the results of her many\r\nand frequent pilgrimages to those beauties of nature which she so\r\nhighly appreciated. But still she would not write her \"Guide\" without\r\nrevisiting the whole of the district.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting point about this book is that it reveals one\r\nfeature of her character that all who knew her mention, but that very\r\nrarely appears in her writings. This is, her keen sense of humor. She\r\ndearly loved a good story, and could tell one herself with pith and\r\npoint. Her laugh is said to have been very hearty and ready. Even when\r\nshe was old and ill, she was always amusable, and her laughter at any\r\nlittle bit of fun would even then ring through her house as gaily as\r\nthough the outburst had been that of a child's frank merriment. It is\r\nsurprising that this sense of and enjoyment in the ludicrous so rarely\r\nappears in her writings. But I think it was because her authorship was\r\nto her too serious a vocation for fun to come into it often. She felt\r\nit almost as the exercise of a priestly function. It was earnest and\r\nalmost solemn work for her to write what might be multiplied through\r\nthe printing-press many thousand times over, and so uttered to all who\r\nhad ears to hear. She showed that this was so by the greater\r\ndeliberateness with which she expressed judgments of persons and\r\npronounced opinions of any kind in her writings than in conversation.\r\nSimilarly she showed it by the abeyance of her humor in writing; it\r\nwas no more possible for her to crack jokes when seated at her desk\r\nthan it would have been for a priestess when standing by her tripod.\r\nBut this particular book, this \"Guide, written for neighborly\r\nreasons,\" did not admit of the seriousness of her intellect being\r\ncalled into action, and the result is that it is full of good stories\r\nand lighted up with fun. Her enjoyment in such stories reveals that\r\nsense of humor which, however strongly visible in daily intercourse,\r\nrarely appears in her books in any other form than in her perfect\r\nappreciation of the line between the sublime and the ludicrous.\r\n\r\nThis summer brought her much annoyance of a pecuniary kind. Her\r\ngenerosity about money matters were repeatedly shown, from the time\r\nwhen she left her \"_Illustrations_\" in the hands of Mr. C. Fox,\r\nonwards; and she had now given what was for her means an extravagant\r\ncontribution to the maintenance of the _Westminster Review_, taking a\r\nmortgage on the proprietorship for her only security. In the summer of\r\n1854, Dr. Chapman, its publisher and editor, failed; and an attempt\r\nwas made to upset the mortgage. Harriet Martineau gave Chapman the\r\nmost kindly assistance and sympathy in his affairs at this juncture;\r\nnot only overlooking the probable loss to herself, but exerting\r\nherself to write two long articles for the next number of the _Review_\r\n(October, 1854).\r\n\r\nOne of these essays is on \"Rajah Brooke;\" a name that has half faded\r\nout of the knowledge of the present generation, but which well\r\ndeserves memory from the heroic devotedness, and courage, and\r\ngoverning faculty of the man. His qualities were those most congenial\r\nto Harriet Martineau; and, finding his enemies active and potent, she\r\nmade a complete study of his case and represented it in full in an\r\narticle which (like her previous one on \"Foreign Policy\") was so\r\nstatesman-like and so wise, so calm and yet so eloquent, that it would\r\nhave made her famous amongst the politicians of the day had it been\r\ndelivered as a speech in the House, instead of being printed\r\nanonymously in a review with too small a circulation to pay its way.\r\n\r\nNor did generous aid to Dr. Chapman end here. He was disappointed of\r\nsome expected contributions, and Miss Martineau wrote him a second\r\nlong article for the same number--the one on \"The Crystal Palace,\"\r\nwhich concludes the _Westminster_ for October, 1854. Her two\r\ncontributions amounted to fifty-four pages of print--truly a generous\r\ngift to an impecunious magazine editor.\r\n\r\nIt was now precisely ten years since her recovery from her long\r\nillness. The work done in that time shows how complete the recovery\r\nhad been. Those ten happy years of vigor and of labor were, she was\r\nwont to say, Mr. Atkinson's gift to her. Well had she used these last\r\nyears of her strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nIN RETREAT; JOURNALISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Martineau's health failed towards the end of 1854; and early in\r\n1855, symptoms of a disorganized circulation became so serious that\r\nshe went up to London to consult physicians. Dr. Latham and Sir Thomas\r\nWatson both came to the conclusion that she was suffering from\r\nenlargement and enfeeblement of the heart; and, in accordance with her\r\nwish to hear a candid statement of her case, they told her that her\r\nlife would probably not be much prolonged. In short they gave her to\r\nunderstand that she was dying; and her own sensations confirmed the\r\nimpression. She had frequent sinking fits; and every night when she\r\nlay down, a struggle for breath began, which lasted sometimes for\r\nhours. She received her death sentence then, and began a course of\r\nlife as trying to the nerves and as searching a test of character as\r\ncould well be imagined. That trial she bore nobly for twenty-one long\r\nsuffering years. She was carefully carried home, and at once occupied\r\nherself with making every preparation for the departure from earth\r\nwhich she supposed to be impending. The first business was to make a\r\nnew will; and this was a characteristic document. After ordering that\r\nher funeral should be conducted in the plainest manner, and at the\r\nleast possible cost, she continued thus:--\"It is my desire, from an\r\ninterest in the progress of scientific investigation, that my skull\r\nshould be given to Henry George Atkinson, of Upper Gloucester Place,\r\nand also my brain, if my death take place within such distance of the\r\nsaid Henry George Atkinson's then present abode as to enable him to\r\nhave it for purposes of scientific investigation.\" Her property was\r\nthen ordered to bear various small charges, including one of L200 to\r\nMrs. Chapman for writing a conclusion to the testator's autobiography,\r\nover and above a fourth share of the profits on the sale of the whole\r\nwork after the first edition. \"The Knoll\" was bequeathed to her\r\nfavorite \"little sister,\" Ellen. The remainder of her possessions were\r\ndivided amongst all her brothers and sisters, or their heirs, with as\r\nmuch impartiality as though she held, with Maggie Tulliver's aunt\r\nGlegg, that \"in the matter of wills, personal qualities were\r\nsubordinate to the great fundamental fact of blood.\" Although\r\nmesmerism had estranged her from a sister, and theology from a\r\nbrother, she made no display of bitter feelings towards them and\r\ntheirs in her last will.\r\n\r\nAll her personal affairs being made as orderly as possible, she\r\nproceeded to write her _Autobiography_. Readers of that interesting\r\nbut misleading work must bear in mind that it was a very hasty\r\nproduction. The two large volumes were written in a few months; the\r\nMS. was sent to the printer as it was produced, the sheets for the\r\nfirst edition were printed off, then the matter was stereotyped, and\r\nthe sheets and plates were packed up in the office of the printer,\r\nduly insured, and held ready for immediate publication after her\r\ndeath. She wrote in this hot haste with \"the shadow cloaked from head\r\nto foot\" at her right hand. So much reason had she to believe that her\r\nvery days were numbered, that she wrote the latter part of her\r\n_Autobiography_ before the first portion. She had already given forth,\r\nin _Household Education_ and _The Crofton Boys_, the results of her\r\nchildish experiences of life; and she was now specially anxious not to\r\ndie without leaving behind her a definite account of the later course\r\nof her intellectual history.\r\n\r\nNo one who knew her considers that she did herself justice in the\r\n_Autobiography_. It is hard and censorious; it displays vanity,\r\nboth in its depreciation of her own work, and in its recital of the\r\npetty slights and insults which had been offered to her from time to\r\ntime; it is aggressive, as though replying to enemies rather than\r\nappealing to friends; and no one of either the finer or the softer\r\nqualities of her nature is at all adequately indicated. It is, in\r\nshort, the least worthy of her true self of all the writings of her\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe reasons of this unfortunate fact was not far to seek. Her\r\nrationalism, and the abuse and moral ill-usage which she had incurred\r\nby her avowal of her anti-theological opinions, were still new to her.\r\nHer very thoughts, replacing as they did the ideas which she held\r\nwithout examination for some twenty years (the time which intervened\r\nbetween her devotional writings and her _Eastern Life_) were still so\r\nfar new that they had not the unconsciousness and the quiet placidity\r\nwhich habit alone gives; for new ideas, like new clothes, sit\r\nuneasily, and are noticeable to their wearer, however carefully they\r\nmay have been fitted before adoption. Again, the announcement in the\r\npress that her illness was fatal revived the discussion of her\r\ninfidelity, and brought down upon her a whole avalanche of signed and\r\nanonymous letters, of little tracts, awe-inspiring hymns, and manuals\r\nof divinity. The letters were controversial, admonishing, minatory, or\r\nentreating; but whatever their character they were all agreed upon one\r\npoint, viz., that her unbelief in Christianity was a frightful sin, of\r\nwhich she had been willfully guilty. They all agreed in supposing that\r\nit was within her own volition to resume her previous faith, and that\r\nshe would not only go to eternal perdition if she did not put on again\r\nher old beliefs, but that she would richly deserve to do so for her\r\nwillful wickedness.\r\n\r\nThus, as Miss Arnold remarked to me, the moment at which she wrote\r\nthe _Autobiography_ was the most aggressive and unpleasant of her\r\nwhole life. Conscious as she was of the purity of her motives in\r\nuttering her philosophical opinions, she found herself suddenly spoken\r\nto by a multitude, whom she could not but know were mentally and\r\nmorally incapable of judging her, as a sinner, worthy of their pity\r\nand reprobation. Knowing that she had long been recognized as a\r\nteacher, in advance of the mass of society in knowledge and power of\r\nthought, here was a crowd of people talking to her in the tones which\r\nthey might have adopted towards some ignorant inmate of a prison. What\r\nwonder that her wounded self-esteem seemed for a little while to pass\r\ninto vanity, when she had to remind the world, from which such insults\r\nwere pouring in, of all that she had done for its instruction in the\r\npast? What wonder that the strength which was summed up to bear with\r\nfortitude this species of modern martyrdom, seemed to give a tone of\r\ncoldness and hardness to writing of so personal a kind? Then the\r\nextreme haste with which the writing and printing were done gave no\r\ntime for the subsidence of such painful impressions; and great\r\nphysical suffering and weakness, together with the powerful depressing\r\nmedicines which were being employed, added to the difficulty of\r\nwriting with calmness, and with a full possession of the sufferer's\r\nwhole nature. In short, an autobiography could not have been written\r\nunder less favorable conditions. All things taken into account, it is\r\nno wonder that those who knew and loved her whole personality were\r\nshocked and amazed at the inadequate presentation given of it in those\r\nvolumes. The sensitive, unselfish, loving, domestic woman, and the\r\njust, careful, disinterested, conscientious and logical author, were\r\nalike obscured rather than revealed; and the biographer whom she chose\r\nto complete the work had neither the intimate personal knowledge, the\r\nmental faculty which might have supplied its place, nor the literary\r\nskill requisite to present a truer picture.\r\n\r\nHer _Autobiography_ completed, the plates engraved, and all publishing\r\narrangements made, she might, had she been an ordinary invalid, have\r\nsettled down into quiet after so hard-working a life. Harriet\r\nMartineau could not do this. Her labors continued uninterruptedly, and\r\nwere pursued to the utmost limit which her illness would allow. She\r\ndid not cease (except during the few months that the _Autobiography_\r\nwas in hand) writing her \"leaders\" for the _Daily News_. Every week it\r\ncontained articles by her, instructing thousands of readers. Yet she\r\nwas _very_ ill. She never left her home again, after that journey to\r\nLondon early in 1855. Sometimes she was well enough to go out upon her\r\nterrace; and she frequently sat in her porch, which was a bower, in\r\nthe summer time, of clematis, honeysuckle, and passion-flowers,\r\nintermingled with ivy; but she could do no more. She was given, as\r\nsoon as she became ill, the daughterly care of her niece, Maria, the\r\ndaughter of her elder brother, Robert Martineau, of Birmingham; and no\r\nmother ever received tenderer care or more valuable assistance from\r\nher own child than Harriet Martineau did from the sensible and\r\naffectionate girl whose life was thenceforth devoted to her service.\r\nMaria once tried if her aunt could be taken out of her own grounds in\r\na bath-chair; but before they reached the gates a fainting fit came\r\non, with such appalling symptoms of stoppage of the heart that the\r\nexperiment was never repeated. Sometimes Miss Martineau would be well\r\nenough to see visitors; more frequently, however, those whom she would\r\nmost have liked to talk with had to be sent away by the doctor's\r\norders. But, through it all, her work continued.\r\n\r\nSoon after the _Autobiography_ was finished, she wrote a long paper\r\nupon a most important subject, and one which she felt to be a source\r\nof the gravest anxiety for the future of English politics--the true\r\nsphere of State interference with daily life. The common ignorance and\r\ncarelessness upon this point she believed to be the most painful and\r\nperilous feature of our present situation.\r\n\r\n    It has been brought to light by beneficent action which is, in\r\n    another view, altogether encouraging. Our benevolence towards the\r\n    helpless, and our interest in personal morality, have grown into a\r\n    sort of public pursuit; and they have taken such a hold on us that\r\n    we may fairly hope that the wretched and the wronged will never\r\n    more be thrust out of sight. But, in the pursuit of our new\r\n    objects, we have fallen back--far further than 1688--in the\r\n    principle of our legislative proposals--undertaking to provide by\r\n    law against personal vices, and certain special social contracts.\r\n\r\nHer devotion to freedom, and her belief in personal liberty, led her\r\nto write an article on \"Meddlesome Legislation\" for the _Westminster\r\nReview_.\r\n\r\nHer pecuniary sacrifices for the _Review_ had been made because she\r\nlooked upon it as an organ for free speech. Her feelings may be\r\nimagined when the editor refused to insert this article, not on any\r\nground of principle, but merely because it spoke too freely of some of\r\nthe advocates of meddlesome factory laws. The essay was published\r\nhowever, as a pamphlet, and had such influence upon a bill then before\r\nParliament that the Association of Factory Occupiers requested to be\r\nallowed to signalize their appreciation of it by giving one hundred\r\nguineas in her name to a charity. A somewhat similar piece of work\r\nfollowed in the next year, a rather lengthy pamphlet _On Corporate\r\nTraditions and National Rights_. She offered nothing more to the\r\n_Westminster Review_, however, for some time; not, indeed, until that\r\nsubject in which she took so profound an interest, the welfare of the\r\nUnited States, and the progress of the anti-slavery cause, seemed to\r\nrequire of her that she should avail herself of every possible means\r\nof addressing the public upon it. Then, in 1857, she wrote an article\r\non _The Manifest Destiny of the American Union_, which appeared in the\r\n_Westminster_ for July of that year.\r\n\r\nHaving thus signalized her forgiveness of that _Review_, she went on\r\nwriting again for it for a little while. In the October number of\r\nthe same year there was a paper by her on _Female Dress_ in 1857.\r\nCrinoline had then lately been introduced by the Empress of the\r\nFrench. If one good, rousing argument could have stood in the path of\r\nfashion, this amusing and vigorous paper from Harriet Martineau's\r\nsick-room might have answered the purpose. But, alas! crinoline\r\nflourished; and five whole years later on was still so enormous that\r\nshe took up her parable against it once more, in _Once a Week_, as\r\nthe cause of \"willful murder.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time she determined to assume the prefix of \"Mrs.\" \"There\r\nwere so many Misses Martineau,\" she said; and, besides, she felt the\r\nabsurdity of a woman of mature years bearing only the same complimentary\r\ntitle as is accorded to a little girl in short frocks at school. Her\r\ncards and the envelopes of her friends bore thenceforward the\r\ninscription, \"Mrs. Harriet Martineau.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough she continued to write, contributing almost every day to the\r\n_Daily News_, as well as to these larger periodicals, she was, it\r\nmust be remembered, an invalid. Her health fluctuated from day to day;\r\nbut it may as well be explicitly stated that she was more or less ill\r\nduring the whole of the rest of her life. She suffered a considerable\r\namount daily of actual pain, which was partly the consequence of the\r\nmedicines prescribed for her, and partly the result of the\r\ndisplacement of the internal organs arising, as her doctors led her to\r\nsuppose, from the enlargement of the heart; but in reality, as was\r\nafterwards discovered, from the growth of a tumor. Her most constant\r\nafflictions were the difficulty of breathing, dizziness, and dimness\r\nof sight, resulting from disturbed circulation. At irregular, but not\r\ninfrequent, intervals she was seized with fainting-fits, in which her\r\nheart appeared to entirely cease beating for a minute or two; and it\r\nwas not certain from day to day but that she might die in one of these\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\nNot only did she continue her work under these conditions, but her\r\ninterest in her poor neighbors remained unabated. There is more than\r\none man now living in Ambleside who traces a part of his prosperity to\r\nthe interest which she from her sick-room displayed in his progress. A\r\nphotograph of her, still sold in Ambleside, was taken in her own\r\ndrawing-room by a young beginner whom she allowed thus to benefit\r\nhimself. He and several others were given free access to her library.\r\nA sickly young woman in the village was made a regular sharer in the\r\ngood things--the wine, the turtle soup, the game and the\r\nflowers--which devoted friends sent frequently to cheer Harriet\r\nMartineau's retirement. Every Christmas, there was a party of the\r\noldest inhabitants of Ambleside invited to spend a long day in the\r\nkitchen of the \"Knoll.\" The residents in her own cottages looked upon\r\nher less as a landlady than as a friend to whom to send in every\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nNor did she cease to do whatever was possible to her in the local\r\npublic life. The question of Church Rates was approaching a crisis\r\nwhen she was taken ill; and when the Ambleside Quakers resolved to\r\norganize resistance to payment of these rates, they found Harriet\r\nMartineau ready to help. The householders who refused to pay were\r\nsummoned before the local bench; and it was Harriet Martineau whom the\r\njustices selected to be distrained upon; but events marched rapidly,\r\nand the distraint was not made.\r\n\r\nThe next article that she contributed to the _Westminster Review_\r\nappeared in the July (1858) number, and, under the title of _The\r\nLast Days of Church Rates_, gave an account of the efforts by which\r\nNon-conformists in all parts of the country were rendering this impost\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1858, there was another long article in the _Westminster_,\r\nentitled _Travel during the Last Half-Century_. She was now, however,\r\ngrowing tired of wasting her work in that quarter, and, as we shall\r\npresently see, she sought a more influential and appreciative medium\r\nfor her longer communications with the public.\r\n\r\nSubjects which could be treated briefly were always taken up as\r\n\"leaders\" for the _Daily News_. Lengthier topics, too, were\r\noccasionally dealt with in those columns in the form of serial\r\narticles. One set of papers on _The Endowed Schools of Ireland_, were\r\ncontributed in this manner, in 1857, to the _Daily News_, and\r\nafterwards reprinted in a small volume. In that same year occurred\r\nthe terrible Indian crisis which compelled the people of this country\r\nto give, for a time, the attention which they so begrudge to their\r\ngreat dependency. Miss Martineau then wrote a series of articles,\r\nunder the title of _The History of British Rule in India_, for the\r\n_Daily News_, and this most useful work was immediately re-published\r\nin a volume. Alas! even she could not make so involved and distant a\r\nstory interesting; but her book was clear and vivid, and whenever it\r\ndealt with the practical problem of the moment, it was full of wisdom\r\nand conscientiousness. This volume was immediately followed by\r\n_Suggestions towards the Future Government of India_. The preface of\r\nthe first is dated October, 1857; and that of the second, January,\r\n1858. The key-note of these books is a plea for the government of\r\nIndia according to Indian ideas; and, as a natural consequence, its\r\ngovernment with the assistance of its natives. Courage as well as\r\ninsight were required at that particular moment of popular passion to\r\nput forward these calm, statesman-like ideas. The wisdom and the\r\npractical value of the books cannot be shown by extracts; but one\r\nparagraph may be given as a faint indication of the tone: \"If instead\r\nof attempting to hold India as a preserve of English destinies, a\r\nnursery of British fortunes, we throw it open with the aim of\r\ndeveloping India for the Indians, by means of British knowledge and\r\nequity, we shall find our own highest advantage, political and\r\nmaterial, and may possibly recognize brethren and comrades at length,\r\nwhere we have hitherto perceived only savages, innocents, or\r\nfoes.\"[22] Such was the spirit to which the _Daily News_, under\r\nHarriet Martineau's hand, led the people at a moment of great\r\npolitical excitement. The amplest testimony to the practical wisdom\r\nof the suggestions that she made was borne by those Anglo-Indians who\r\nwere qualified to judge.\r\n\r\n          [22] _Future Government of India_, p. 94.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1858, she wrote the first letter, which lies before me, to\r\nher relative, Mr. Henry Reeve, the editor of the _Edinburgh Review_.\r\nIn this, after telling him that she never before has offered or wished\r\nto write for that _Review_, because in politics she had generally\r\ndisagreed with it (to her, it may be remarked in passing, Toryism was\r\nless odious than official Whigism), she says that she has now a\r\nsubject in view which she thinks would be suitable for the pages of\r\nthe good old Whig organ. Before entering into details, she begs him to\r\ntell her frankly if any article will be refused merely because it\r\ncomes from her. She adds that her health is so sunk and her life so\r\nprecarious, that all her engagements have to be made with an\r\nexplanation of the chances against their fulfillment; still she _does_\r\nwrite a good deal, and with higher success than in her younger days.\r\n\r\nMr. Reeve replied cordially inviting her contributions, and the result\r\nwas the establishment both of an intimate correspondence with him, and\r\nof a relationship with the _Review_ under his charge, which lasted\r\nuntil she could write no more.\r\n\r\nThe particular subject which she offered Mr. Reeve at first did not\r\nseem to him a suitable one. The title of it was to have been _French\r\nInvasion Panics_; but as Mr. Reeve did not like the idea, the paper\r\nwas not written. But for the _Edinburgh_ of April, 1859, she wrote a\r\nlong article on _Female Industry_, which attracted much attention. Its\r\npurpose was to show how greatly the conditions of women's lives are\r\naltered in this century from what they were of old. \"A very large\r\nproportion of the women of England earn their own bread; and there is\r\nno saying how much good may be done by a timely recognition of this\r\nsimple truth. A social organization framed for a community of which\r\nhalf stayed at home while the other half went out to work, cannot\r\nanswer the purposes of a society of which a quarter remains at home\r\nwhile three-quarters go out to work.\" After considering in detail,\r\nwith equal benevolence and wisdom, the condition of the various\r\nclasses of women workers--those employed in agriculture, mines,\r\nfishing, domestic service, needlework, and shop-keeping, and\r\nsuggesting, in passing, the schools of cookery which have since become\r\nestablished facts, the article concludes: \"The tale is plain enough.\r\nSo far from our countrywomen being all maintained as a matter of fact\r\nby us, the 'bread-winners,' three millions out of six of adult English\r\nwomen work for subsistence, and two out of the three in independence.\r\nWith this new condition of affairs new duties and new views must be\r\nadopted. Old obstructions must be removed; and the aim must be set\r\nbefore us, as a nation as well as in private life, to provide for the\r\nfree development and full use of the powers of every member of the\r\ncommunity.\" It scarcely needs to be pointed out that here she went\r\nquietly but surely to the foundation of that whole class of new claims\r\nand demands on behalf of the women of our modern world, of which she\r\nwas so valuable an advocate, and for the granting of which her life\r\nwas so excellent a plea. In these few sentences she at one time\r\ndisplayed the character of the changes required, and the reasons why\r\nit is now necessary, as it did not use to be, that women should be\r\ncompletely enfranchised, industrially and otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe year 1859 was a very busy one. Besides the long article just\r\nmentioned, she published in April of that year quite a large volume on\r\n_England and her Soldiers_. The book was written to aid the work\r\nwhich her beloved friend Florence Nightingale, had in hand for the\r\nbenefit of the army. It was, in effect, a popularization of all that\r\nhad come out before the Royal Commission on the sanitary condition of\r\nthe army; with the additional advantage of the views and opinions of\r\nFlorence Nightingale, studied at first hand. One of the most beautiful\r\nfeatures of the book is the hearty and generous delight with which the\r\none illustrious lady recounts the efforts, the sacrifices, and the\r\ntriumphs of the other.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, also, Mrs. Martineau began to write frequent letters for\r\npublication to the American _Anti-Slavery Standard_. The affairs\r\nof the Republic were plainly approaching a crisis; and those in\r\nAmerica who knew how well-informed she was on the politics of both\r\ncountries, and on political principles, were anxious to have the\r\nguidance that only she could give in the difficult time that was\r\napproaching. During the three years, 1859 to 1861, she sent over\r\nninety long articles for publication in America.\r\n\r\nAn article on _Trades Unions_, denouncing the tyranny of men in\r\nfustian coats sitting round a beer-shop table, as to the full as\r\nmischievous as that of crowned and titled despots, appeared in the\r\n_Edinburgh Review_ for October, 1859. In the July (1860) issue of the\r\nsame _Review_ she wrote on _Russia_, and in October of that year on\r\n_The American Union_.\r\n\r\nBesides these large undertakings, she was writing during these years\r\nalmost weekly articles, on one topic or another, for the illustrated\r\nperiodical _Once a Week_; whilst the _Daily News_ \"leaders\" continued\r\nwithout intermission during the whole time. As regards these latter, I\r\nshall presently mention when she entirely ceased to write; but in the\r\nmeanwhile I do not attempt to follow them in detail. Nothing that I\r\ncould say would give any adequate impression of their quality. _That_\r\nmay be sufficiently judged by the fact that the newspaper in which\r\nthey were issued was one of the best of the great London dailies; and\r\nthat, during her time, it touched the highest point of influence and\r\ncirculation, as the organ of no clique, but the consistent advocate of\r\nhigh principles, and just, consistent, sound (not mere \"Liberal\r\nParty\") political action. As to the subjects of the _Daily News_\r\narticles, they range over the whole field of public interests,\r\nexcepting only those \"hot and hot\" topics which had to be treated\r\nimmediately that fresh news about them reached London. Those who were\r\nwith Mrs. Martineau tell me that the only difficulty with her was to\r\nchoose what subject she would treat each day, out of the many that\r\noffered. She kept up an extensive correspondence, and read\r\ncontinually; and her fertile mind, highly cultivated as it was by her\r\nlife-long studies, had some original and valuable contribution to make\r\nupon the vast variety of the topics of which each day brought\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\nThe marvel that a sick lady, shut up in her house in a remote village,\r\ncould thus keep touch with and take an active part in all the\r\ninterests and movements of the great world, increases the more it is\r\nconsidered. The very correspondence by which she was aided in knowing\r\nand feeling what the public mind was stirred about, was in itself a\r\nheavy labor, and a great tax upon such feeble strength as she\r\npossessed. The letters with which Mr. Reeve has favored me give\r\nglimpses of how ideas and calls came to her sometimes. Here is a\r\ngraphic account, for instance, of a man riding up with a telegram from\r\nMiss Nightingale--\"Agitate! agitate! for Lord de Grey in place of Sir\r\nG. Cornewall Lewis\"--which gives the first intimation in Ambleside\r\nthat the post of War Minister is vacant. The newspaper arrives later,\r\nand Lewis' death is learned; so a \"leader\" is written early next\r\nmorning, to catch the coach, and appears in the following morning's\r\n_Daily News_. Presently Lord de Grey is appointed, and then the\r\ntwo women friends rejoice together in the chance of getting army\r\nreforms made by a minister who, they hope, will not be a slave to\r\nroyal influences. Another time she tells Mr. Reeve how she is treating\r\nthe _Reversion of Mysore_ in the _Daily News_, on the suggestion of a\r\nman learned in Indian affairs; and again, that she is reviewing a book\r\nof Eastern travel at the request of a friend. In fine, there were\r\nconstant letters seeking to engage her interest and aid in every\r\ndescription of reforms, and for all kinds of movements in public\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nBut with all the wide circle of suggesting correspondents, the wonder\r\nof the prolific mind working so actively from the Ambleside hermitage\r\nremains untouched. Perhaps I cannot better show how much she did, and\r\nhow wide a range she covered, in _Daily News_ \"leaders,\" than by\r\ngiving a list of the articles of a single year. I take 1861, really at\r\nrandom. It was simply the page at which the office ledger happened to\r\nbe open before me.\r\n\r\nHere are the subjects of her _Daily News_ \"leaders\" in 1861:\r\n\r\n    The American Union; The King of Prussia; Arterial Drainage; Sidney\r\n    Herbert; The Secession of South Carolina; Cotton Supply; Laborers'\r\n    Dwellings; The American Difficulty (two days); Destitution and its\r\n    Remedy; The American Revolution; Cotton Culture; The American\r\n    Union; Indian Affairs; America; North and South; American Politics;\r\n    Agricultural Labor; The London Bakers; President Buchanan; The\r\n    Southern Confederacy; United States Population; The Duchess of\r\n    Kent; Indian Famines; Agricultural Statistics; President Lincoln's\r\n    Address; Indian Currency; American Census; The Southern\r\n    Confederacy; The Action of the South; The Census; America and\r\n    Cotton; The American Envoy; Lord Canning's Address; The American\r\n    Crisis; Spain and San Domingo; East Indian Irrigation; Water-mills;\r\n    Hayti and San Domingo; The Conflict in America; American Movements;\r\n    The Secession Party; The American Contest; The Literary Fund;\r\n    Working-men's Visit to Paris; Mr. Clay's Letter; The American\r\n    Contest; Money's \"Java\" (four articles); Mr. Douglas; Our American\r\n    Relations; Lord Campbell; Results of American Strife; Our Cotton\r\n    Supply; American Union; Soldiers' Homes; Indian Irrigation; San\r\n    Domingo; American Movements; Slavery in America; The Morrill\r\n    Tariff; Drainage in Agriculture; Neutrality with America; The\r\n    Builders' Strike; Lord Herbert; Lord Elgin's Government; The\r\n    Builders' Dispute; The Strike; The American Contest; Indian\r\n    Famines; Syrian Improvement; Affairs of Hayti; Cotton Supply; The\r\n    American War and Slavery; Mr. Cameron and General Butler;\r\n    Post-office Robberies; The American Press; Mrs. Stowe; The Morrill\r\n    Tariff; American Affairs; Domestic Servants; The Education Minutes;\r\n    The Georgian Circular; French Free Trade; The Fremont Resolution;\r\n    Laborers' Improvidence; American Humiliation; The Education Code; A\r\n    Real Social Evil; Captain Jervis in America; The American Contest;\r\n    Indian Cotton; Slaves in America; The Prince of Wales; American\r\n    Movements; Lancashire Cotton Trade; India and Cotton; Cotton\r\n    Growing; The Herbert Testimonial; Captain Wilkes' Antecedents;\r\n    Arterial Drainage; The American Controversy; Land in India; Slaves\r\n    in America; Death of Prince Albert; Slavery; Loyalty in Canada;\r\n    Review of the Year, five columns long.\r\n\r\nThis gives a total of one hundred and nine leading articles, in that\r\none year, on political and social affairs. In the same year she wrote\r\nto the Boston _Anti-Slavery Standard_ as much matter as would have\r\nmade about forty-five \"leaders;\" and during the same period she\r\nregularly contributed to _Once a Week_[23] a fortnightly article on\r\nsome current topic, and also a series of biographical sketches\r\nentitled \"Representative Men.\" These _Once a Week_ articles were all\r\nmuch longer than \"leaders;\" the year's aggregate of space filled, in\r\n1861, is two hundred and eighty-one of the closely printed columns of\r\n_Once a Week_; and this would be equivalent to at least one hundred\r\nand forty leading articles in the usual \"leaded\" type. I need not give\r\na complete list of titles of the year's _Once a Week_ articles; but a\r\nfew may be cited to show what class of subjects she selected: \"Our\r\nPeasantry in Progress,\" \"Ireland and her Queen,\" \"The Harvest,\" \"The\r\nDomestic Service Question,\" \"What Women are Educated for,\" \"American\r\nSoldiering,\" \"Deaths by Fire,\" \"The Sheffield Outrages,\" \"Education\r\nand the Racing Season.\"\r\n\r\n          [23] Most of these papers are signed \"From the Mountain.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was Harriet Martineau's work for the year 1861; and thus could\r\nshe, confined to her house, comprehend and care for the condition of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that she had written on Domestic Servants both in\r\nthe _Daily News_ and _Once a Week_; but still she had not said all\r\nthat she wished to say about the subject, and early in the next year\r\nshe wrote a long article on it, which appeared in the _Edinburgh_\r\nfor April, 1862. It is a capital article, distinguished alike by\r\ncommon-sense, and by wide-reaching sympathy; _womanly_ in the best\r\nsense--in its domestic knowledge, and its feeling for women in their\r\nperplexities and troubles, whether as servants or mistresses,--and yet\r\nphilosophical in its calmness, its power of tracing from causes to\r\neffects, and its practical wisdom in forestalling future difficulties.\r\n\r\nIn this year she began to write historical stories, \"Historiettes,\" as\r\nshe called them, for _Once a Week_. As fictions, they are not equal to\r\nher best productions of that class; but their special value was less\r\nin this direction, or even in the detailed historical knowledge that\r\nthey displayed, than in the insight into the philosophy of political\r\nhistory which the reader gained. They were illustrated by Millais, and\r\nproved so attractive that they were continued during the next two\r\nyears. One, dealing with the constitutional struggle in the reign of\r\nCharles I., and called \"The Hampdens,\" has been re-published so\r\nrecently as 1880.\r\n\r\nA large portion of her time and thought was absorbed, in these years,\r\nby the American struggle and its consequences. Loving the United States\r\nand their people as she did, the interest and anxiety with which she\r\nwatched their progress were extreme. She was no coward--as it is, no\r\ndoubt, hardly necessary to remark on this page--and though she grieved\r\ndeeply for the sufferings both of personal friends and of the whole\r\ncountry, yet her soul rose up in noble exultation over the courage, the\r\nresolution, and the high-mindedness of the bulk of the American nation.\r\nOver here, she threw herself with warm eagerness into the effort to\r\nsupport those Lancashire workers upon whom fell so heavy a tax of\r\ndeprivation in the cotton famine. The patience, the quietness, the\r\nheroism with which our North-Country workers bore all that they had to\r\nsuffer, supported as they were by the sympathy of the mass of their\r\nfellow-countrymen, and by their own intelligent convictions that they\r\nwere aiding a good cause by remaining peaceful and quiet--this was just\r\nthe sort of thing to arouse all Harriet Martineau's loving sympathies.\r\n\"Her face would all light up and the tears would rush to her eyes\r\nwhenever she was told of a noble deed,\" says Miss Arnold; \"no matter\r\nhow humble the doer, or how small the matter might seem, you could see\r\nthe delight it gave her to know that a fine, brave, or unselfish act\r\nhad been done.\" Animated by such respectful joy in the attitude of the\r\nLancashire workers, she threw herself into their service; and her\r\ncorrespondence on this topic during 1861, when she used all her public\r\nand private influence on their behalf, and employed her best energies\r\nin aiding and advising the relief committees, would fill a large\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of her labors for America, she could not but be gratified\r\nby the testimonies which constantly reached her from that country to\r\nthe appreciation of the work which she had done and was doing.\r\n\r\n_The History of the Peace_ was reprinted in Boston in the very midst\r\nof the civil war, \"at the instance of men of business throughout the\r\ncountry, who believe it will do great good from its political and yet\r\nmore economical lessons, which are so much wanted.\" The publishers of\r\nthe _Atlantic Monthly_ appealed to her to write them a series of\r\narticles on \"Military Hygiene;\" and, over-pressed as she was, she\r\ncould not refuse a request which enabled her to do much good service\r\nfor the soldiers of the North, for whom she felt so deeply. Nor were\r\nmore private tributes to the value of her efforts lacking. A set of\r\nthe _Rebellion Record_, published by Putnam, was sent to her with the\r\ncover stamped under the title with these words: \"Presented by citizens\r\nof New York to Harriet Martineau;\" and innumerable books came with\r\ntestimonies inscribed by the writers, such as that in Henry Wilson's\r\n_Slave Power in America_, which was as follows: \"Mrs. Harriet\r\nMartineau; with the gratitude of the author for her friendship for his\r\ncountry, and her devotion to freedom.\"[24]\r\n\r\n          [24] The highest honor yet done to her memory is the work of\r\n          our sisters and brothers across the Atlantic. A public\r\n          subscription has raised funds for a statue of Harriet\r\n          Martineau, which has been executed by Anne Whitney, in white\r\n          marble. The statue represents Mrs. Martineau seated, with her\r\n          hands folded over a manuscript on her knees. The head is\r\n          raised, and has a light veil thrown over the back of it and\r\n          falling down upon the shoulders, while a shawl is draped\r\n          partially over the figure. The eyes are looking forth, as\r\n          though in that thoughtful questioning of the future to which\r\n          she often gave herself. The statue was unveiled in the Old\r\n          South Hall, Boston, December 26th, 1883, in the presence of\r\n          many notable personages. Mrs. Mary Livermore presided, and\r\n          speeches were made by William Lloyd Garrison, Jun., and\r\n          Wendell Phillips, in the case of the last-named it was his\r\n          final speech, for he, too, six weeks after, was numbered\r\n          amongst those who are at rest. \"The audience sat in silence\r\n          for a moment as the white vision was unveiled; then went up\r\n          such applause as stirred the echoes of the historic interior\r\n          in which the ceremony took place.\"\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the year 1862, Harriet Martineau wrote a paper\r\non \"Our Convict System,\" which appeared in the following January\r\nnumber of the _Edinburgh_. It will be noted that she never wrote on\r\nthe politics of the day--the action of the Government and Opposition\r\nof the moment--in this _Review_; her political principles were too\r\ndemocratic for the great Whig organ.\r\n\r\nIn _Once a Week_, however, her articles became more decisively\r\npolitical year by year. Some of her best political papers are in that\r\nmagazine for 1863. The most noteworthy feature in them are their\r\nbasis of principles and not of party, and their practical wisdom.\r\nWhen I speak of her devotion to principles, in politics, I half fear\r\nthat I may be misunderstood--for so shockingly does Cant spawn its\r\nloathsomeness over every holy phrase, that such expressions come to\r\nus \"defamed by every charlatan,\" and doubtful in their use. But she\r\nwas neither doctrinaire, nor blind, nor pig-headed, nor pharisaic,\r\nnor jealous, nor scheming; but wise, brave, truthful, upright, and\r\nindependent. Love of justice and truthfulness of speech were as much\r\nto her in public affairs as they are to any high-minded person in\r\nprivate. Her desire in her thoughts and utterances on politics was\r\nsimply to secure \"the greatest happiness for the greatest number\"\r\nof the people; and the spirit in which she worked was correctly\r\nappraised by the then editor of the _Daily News_, William Weir, when\r\nhe wrote to her in these terms, in 1856:--\r\n\r\n    I have never before met--I do not hope again to meet--one so\r\n    earnest (as you) to promote progress, so practical in the means by\r\n    which to arrive at it. My aim in life is to be able to say, when\r\n    it is closing, \"I, too, have done somewhat, though little, to\r\n    benefit my kind;\" and there are so few who do not regard this as\r\n    Quixotism or hypocrisy, that I shrink even from confessing it.\r\n\r\nHe so well recognized that as truly _her_ aim also that he did not\r\nfear to utter to her his high aspiration. It is in this spirit that\r\nher political articles are written, and the result of the constant\r\nreference to principles is that her essays are almost as instructive\r\nreading now as they were when first published; _then_, their interest\r\nand their importance were both incalculable.\r\n\r\nOf such articles Harriet Martineau wrote in the _Daily News_, from\r\nfirst to last, _sixteen hundred and forty-two_: besides the great\r\nnumber that I have referred to, which appeared in other journals. I\r\nwonder how many of the men who have presumed to say that the women are\r\n\"incapable of understanding politics,\" or of \"sympathizing in great\r\ncauses,\" received a large part of their political education, and of\r\nrousing stimulus to public-spirited action, from those journalistic\r\nwritings by Harriet Martineau?\r\n\r\nAn instructive article on \"The Progress of the Negro Race\" was\r\nprepared for the _Edinburgh_ of January, 1864. Only a few weeks after\r\nthe appearance of this, there fell upon her the greatest blow of her\r\nold age. Her beloved niece Maria, who had for so long filled the place\r\nof a daughter to her, was taken ill with typhoid fever, and died after\r\na three weeks' illness. Maria Martineau's active disposition, and her\r\nintellectual power (which was far above the average) had made her an\r\nideal companion for her aunt, and the blow to _her_ was a terrible\r\none. Ill and suffering as she was before, this shock completed the\r\nwreck of Harriet Martineau's health. She had a dreary time of illness\r\nimmediately after her niece's death; and although she went on writing\r\nfor some time longer, it was always with the feeling that the end of\r\nher long life's industry was near at hand.\r\n\r\nShe was not left alone; for Maria's youngest sister, Jane, presently\r\noffered voluntarily to fill, as far as she could, the vacant place at\r\n\"The Knoll.\" The family from which these sisters came was one in which\r\nkindliness and generosity were (and are to this day, with its younger\r\nmembers who remain) distinguishing features. It was no light matter for\r\nMr. and Mrs. Robert Martineau to part with a second daughter to their\r\nsister; but, as it was Jane's own wish to try to be to that beloved and\r\nhonored relative what Maria had been, the parents would not refuse\r\ntheir permission. Harriet wrote of this to Mr. Reeve with her heart\r\nfull; telling him how \"humbly grateful\" she felt for what was so\r\ngenerously offered to her, and with what thankfulness she accepted the\r\nblessing. Even in such circumstances, she could note what a delight it\r\nwas to find that Maria's own spirit of devotedness prevailed amongst\r\nthem all--for nothing could be nobler and sweeter than the conduct of\r\neveryone.\r\n\r\nBy June of that same year, 1864, Mrs. Martineau was ready to undertake\r\nanother article on a topic which pressed upon her mind, \"Co-operative\r\nSocieties,\" which was published in the _Edinburgh_ for October\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nShe went on writing for the _Daily News_, through that year and the\r\nnext, though the effort came to be constantly more and more laborious.\r\nHer interest in public affairs did not flag; nor is there the least\r\nsign of failure of power in her letters; but she became increasingly\r\nconscious that it was a strain upon her to write under the\r\nresponsibility of addressing the public.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1865 she wrote some articles on \"The Scarcity of Nurses,\"\r\n\"poked up to do it,\" as she said, by Florence Nightingale. In the\r\nApril of the same year was prepared an article on \"Female Convicts,\"\r\nwhich was published in the _Edinburgh_ for October. In sending this\r\nshe intimated to the editor that it would be her last contribution,\r\nas she felt the strain of such writing too great for her strength.\r\nAfter all she did prepare one more article for the _Edinburgh_,\r\nthough it was as long afterwards as 1868. This was the paper on\r\n\"Salem Witchcraft,\" which will be found in the number of that\r\n_Review_ for July. It formed Harriet Martineau's last contribution of\r\nany length to literature; and she wrote it with some reluctance,\r\nafter having suggested the subject to Mr. Reeve, and he having\r\nreplied that he could find no one suitable to undertake it but\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nShe was very loath to cease her writing for the _Daily News_, and\r\ncontinued it until the spring of 1866. It was a great trial when at\r\nlast the moment came that she felt she absolutely _must_ be freed from\r\nthe obligation and the temptation to frequent work. But the spring was\r\nalways her worst time as to health; and during this customary vernal\r\nexacerbation of illness, in April, 1866, she found herself obliged at\r\nlast, after fourteen years' service, to send in her resignation to the\r\n_Daily News_.\r\n\r\nWhen she thus terminated her connection with the paper through whose\r\ncolumns she had spoken so long, she practically concluded her literary\r\nlife. Neither her intellectual powers, nor her interest in public\r\naffairs, were perceptibly diminished; as will presently be seen, these\r\ncontinued to the end of her life all but unabated. Her regular\r\nliterary exertions were now, however, at an end; and she was ill\r\nenough by this time, her niece tells me, to feel only relief at being\r\nfreed from the constant pressure of the duty of thought and speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST YEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHarriet Martineau had never gone the right way to work to become rich\r\nby literature. She had not chosen her subjects with a view to the mere\r\nmonetary success she might attain, and, not infrequently, she had\r\ndisplayed a rare generosity in her pecuniary affairs. In April, 1867,\r\nshe was plunged into perplexity about the means of living, by the\r\ntemporary failure of the Brighton Railway to pay its dividends. After\r\nall her work, she had but little to lose. She had from investments in\r\nthe preference stock of that railway L230 per annum, and she had only\r\nL150 yearly from all other sources. Such was the fortune saved, after\r\nlabors such as hers, through a long life of industry and thrift. There\r\nwas a beautiful contest between the inmates of that home, when the\r\ntrouble came, as to which of them should begin to make the necessary\r\nsacrifices involved in economizing. Miss Jane Martineau and the maid\r\nCaroline were each ready with their offers, and the invalid mistress\r\nof the house was with difficulty induced to continue her wine and\r\ndinner ale, while she declared, with a brave assumption of\r\ncarelessness, that she should be rather glad than otherwise to be rid\r\nof seeing the _Times_ daily and getting the periodic box of books from\r\n\"Mudie's.\" It is touching to note how she tried to lightly pass off\r\nthis sacrifice of current literature, when one knows that reading was\r\nthe chief solace of her lonely and suffering days. Her family\r\nintervened, however, to prevent any such deprivations, and by-and-by\r\nthe company resumed payment of its dividends.\r\n\r\nIn 1868, she received a generous offer, which touched her very deeply.\r\nMr. J. R. Robinson, of the _Daily News_, proposed to her that there\r\nshould be a reprint of the several biographical sketches which she had\r\ncontributed to the paper during her connection with it; and he offered\r\nto take all the trouble and responsibility of putting the volume\r\nthrough the press, while leaving to her the whole of the profits. She\r\nhad not even supposed that the copyright in the biographies which she\r\nhad written for the paper from time to time, upon the occasions of the\r\ndeaths of eminent persons, remained her property. Mr. Robinson had the\r\nsatisfaction of assuring her that the proprietors held her at liberty\r\nto reproduce these writings, and, with that comrade's generosity which\r\nis not altogether rare among journalists, her kind friend devoted\r\nhimself to securing her a good publisher, and editing the volume,\r\n_Biographical Sketches_, for her benefit. These vignettes well\r\ndeserved re-production. She had had more or less personal acquaintance\r\nwith nearly every one of the forty-six eminent persons of whom she\r\ntreated; and the portraits which she sketched were equally vivid and\r\nimpartial. The work was received by the public with an enthusiasm\r\nwhich repaid Mr. Robinson for his generous efforts. It was reprinted\r\nin America; and it is now in its fourth English edition.\r\n\r\nThe last occasion upon which she was to give her powers and her\r\ninfluence to a difficult but great public work must now be mentioned.\r\nIt was the final effort of her career. Marked as that life had been\r\nall through by devotedness to public duty, she never before was\r\nengaged in a task so painful and difficult, or one which, upon mere\r\npersonal grounds, she might more strongly have desired to evade. But\r\nat near seventy years old, and so enfeebled that she had thought her\r\nwork quite finished, she no more hesitated to come to the front under\r\nfire when it became necessary, than she had done in those active\r\nyounger days when combat may have had its own delights.\r\n\r\nThe subject was an Act of Parliament passed in 1869, having reference\r\nto certain police powers over women in various large towns. \"In our\r\ntime, or in any other,\" wrote Mrs. Martineau, \"there never was a\r\ngraver question.\" It was clear to her that if women \"did not insist\r\nupon the restoration of the most sacred liberties of half the people\r\nof England, men alone would never do it;\" and she wrote four letters\r\non the subject to the _Daily News_, as powerful, as sensible, as free\r\nfrom cant of any kind, as clear in the appreciation of facts, and as\r\ndefinite and able in the presentation of them, as anything she had\r\never written. She wrote, also, and signed an \"Appeal to the Women of\r\nEngland\" upon the subject, where her name headed the list of signers,\r\nwhilst that of Florence Nightingale came next. Two such women,\r\nvenerated not less for the intellectual capacity and practical wisdom\r\nthan for the devoted benevolence that they had shown in their long\r\nlives, were well able to arouse and lead the moral sense of the\r\nwomanhood of England in this crisis. Other respected names were soon\r\nadded to theirs, but it would not be easy to over-estimate the value\r\nof the self-sacrificing, brave action, at the most critical moment, of\r\nthese two great and honorable women.\r\n\r\nBesides writing articles, and appeals, and signing documents which\r\nwere placarded as election posters in some great towns, Mrs. Martineau\r\nhelped that cause in the way told in the following letter to Mr.\r\nAtkinson:\r\n\r\n    May 21st, 1871.\r\n\r\n    One pleasant thing has happened lately. I _longed_ for money for a\r\n    public object [repeal of the acts in question], and, unable to do\r\n    better, worked a chair, and had it beautifully made up. It was\r\n    produced at a great evening party in, London, and seized upon and\r\n    vehemently competed for, and it has actually brought fifty\r\n    guineas! In the middle of the night it occurs to me what a thing\r\n    it is to give fifty guineas--so much as I had longed for money to\r\n    give that fund. I was asked for a letter of explanation and\r\n    statement to go with the chair, and, of course, did it by that\r\n    post.\r\n\r\nWork for this cause formed the most keen and active interest of her\r\nlatest years. In this she thought and labored constantly. She gave her\r\nname and support to other objects, but only quietly. Amongst other\r\nthings she was a member of the Women's Suffrage Society; and she was a\r\nsubscriber to the movement for the medical education of women.\r\n\r\nIn all public affairs, indeed, her interest remained keen and unabated\r\nto the very last, as the letters for which I am indebted to Mr.\r\nAtkinson, and which I am to quote, will abundantly show. These letters\r\nwill indicate, too, something of the quiet course of her now uneventful\r\ndaily life. Sick and weary as she was, it will be seen that literature\r\nand politics, the public welfare, and the concerns of her household's\r\ninmates, still occupied her thoughts and her pen.\r\n\r\n    LETTERS TO MR. ATKINSON.\r\n\r\n    August 24, 1870.\r\n\r\n    ... I am as careful as possible to prevent anyone losing sleep on\r\n    my account, and being disturbed at meals, or failing in air,\r\n    exercise and pleasure. If these regular healthy habits of my\r\n    household become difficult, we are to have a trained nurse at once.\r\n    This is settled. I am disposed to think, myself, that the last\r\n    stage will be short, probably the end sudden.\r\n\r\nThe tone of this last sentence is no affectation. \"She used to talk\r\nabout her death as if it meant no more than going into the next room,\"\r\nsaid one who knew her in these years.\r\n\r\n    September 10, 1870.\r\n\r\n    ... I am not sure whether you have read Dr. Bence Jones's _Life\r\n    and Letters of Faraday_. I have been thankful, this last week,\r\n    for the strong interest of that book, which puts Continental\r\n    affairs out of my head for hours together. The first half volume\r\n    is rather tiresome--giving us four times as much as necessary of\r\n    the uncultivated youth's early prosing on crude moralities, etc.\r\n    It is quite right to give us _some_ of this, to show from how low\r\n    a point of thought and style he rose up to his perfection of\r\n    expression as a lecturer and writer; but a quarter of the early\r\n    stuff would have been enough for that. The succeeding part, for\r\n    hundreds of pages, is the richest treat I have had for many a\r\n    day. I can only distantly and dimly follow the scientific\r\n    lectures and writings; but I understand enough of sympathy; and\r\n    the disclosures of the moral nature of the man is perfectly\r\n    exquisite. I have never known, and have scarcely dreamed of, a\r\n    spirit and temper so thoroughly uniting the best attributes of\r\n    the sage and the child.\r\n\r\n\r\n    October 18, 1870.\r\n\r\n    I had my envelope directed yesterday, but was prevented writing,\r\n    and in the evening came your welcome letter. I am glad to know\r\n    _when_ you mean to leave your quarters; and every line from\r\n    France is interesting.\r\n\r\n    I wonder whether you remember a night in London when dear Mrs.\r\n    Reid and you and I were returning in her carriage from Exeter\r\n    Hall and the _Messiah_. I was saying that that sacred drama\r\n    reminded me of Holy Philae, and the apotheosis of Osiris, and how\r\n    the one was as true as the other, with its \"Peace on earth, and\r\n    good-will to men,\" so false a prophesy, etc., etc. Whereupon Mrs.\r\n    Reid said, plaintively (of the _Messiah_), \"I believe it all at\r\n    the time,\" but she did not set up any pretense of the promises\r\n    having been fulfilled. It does not seem as if Christendom had got\r\n    on very much since the world said, \"See how these Christians love\r\n    one another!\" I seem to have got to a new state of mind about\r\n    war, or I may perhaps forget the emotions of youth; but I seem\r\n    never before to have felt the horror, disgust, shame--in short,\r\n    misery--that the spectacle of this war creates now. I am reading\r\n    less and less in the newspapers; for the truth is, I cannot\r\n    endure it. There is no good in any _hopeless_ spectacle; and for\r\n    France, I am, like, most people, utterly hopeless.... By selling\r\n    themselves for twenty years to the worst and meanest man in\r\n    Europe, the people of France have incurred destruction; and\r\n    though most of us knew this all the time, we do not suffer the\r\n    less from the spectacle now.... I suppose the French will have no\r\n    alternative but peace in a little while; but, when all that is\r\n    settled, internal strife and domestic ruin will remain ahead. The\r\n    truth is, the _morale_ of the French is corrupted to the core.\r\n    All habit of integrity and sincerity is apparently lost; and when\r\n    a people prefers deception to truth, vain-glory to honor, passion\r\n    to reason--all is over. I will leave it, for it is a terrible\r\n    subject. I must just say that I believe and know that there _are_\r\n    French citizens--a very few--who understand the case, but they\r\n    are as wretched as they necessarily must be. But \"the gay,\r\n    licentious, proud,\" the pleasure-loving, self-seeking\r\n    aristocracy, and the brutally ignorant rural population, must\r\n    entirely paralyze the intelligent, an honest few scattered in\r\n    their midst. But I must leave all this.\r\n\r\n    The only news we have is of the royal marriage (Princess Louise)\r\n    which pleases everybody. It is a really great event--as a sign\r\n    politically, and as a fact socially and morally. After the\r\n    Queen's marriage, I wrote repeatedly on behalf of repealing the\r\n    Royal Marriage Act _then_, while there could be no invidious\r\n    appearance in it. The present chaotic condition of Protestant\r\n    princedoms in Germany may answer the purpose almost as well as a\r\n    period of abeyance. Any way, the relaxation seems a wise and\r\n    happy one.\r\n\r\n    My items of news are small in comparison, but not small to me;\r\n    especially that a happy idea struck me lately, of trying a spring\r\n    mattress as a means of obtaining sleep of some continuance. I\r\n    have ventured upon getting one; and, after four nights, there is\r\n    no doubt of my being able to sleep longer, and with more loss of\r\n    consciousness than for a very long time. Last night I once slept\r\n    three hours with only one break. Otherwise, I go on much the\r\n    same. There is one objection to these beds which healthy people\r\n    are unaware of--that so much more strength is required to move in\r\n    bed, from want of _purchase_. This is a trouble, but the\r\n    advantages far outweigh it.\r\n\r\n    Dear Jenny comes home to-morrow evening, all the better, I am\r\n    assured, for three weeks at the sea, in breeze and sun, and all\r\n    manner of beauty of land and sea (at Barmouth, and with a merry\r\n    party of young people). And here is a game basket, arrived from\r\n    parts unknown, with a fine hare, two brace of partridges, and a\r\n    pheasant. A savory welcome for Jenny! Cousin Mary has been more\r\n    good and kind than I can say. She stays for Jenny, and leaves us\r\n    on Friday. I must not begin upon Huxley, Tyndall, and Evans, whom\r\n    I have been reading. Much pleasure to you, dear friend, in your\r\n    closing weeks.\r\n\r\n    Yours ever,\r\n\r\n    H. MARTINEAU.\r\n\r\nThe sleepless nights repeatedly mentioned in these letters were a\r\nsource of great suffering to her in these latest years; under medical\r\nadvice she tried smoking as a means of procuring better rest, with\r\nsome success. She smoked usually through the chiboque which she had\r\nbrought home with her from the East, and which she had there learned\r\nto use, as she relates with her customary simplicity and directness\r\nin the appendix to _Eastern Life_: \"I found it good for my health,\"\r\nshe says there, \"and I saw no more reason why I should not take it\r\nthan why English ladies should not take their glass of sherry at\r\nhome--an indulgence which I do not need. I continued the use of my\r\nchiboque for some weeks after my return, and then only left it off\r\nbecause of the inconvenience.\" When health and comfort were to be\r\npromoted by it, she resumed it. Her nights were, nevertheless, very\r\nbroken, and frequent allusions occur in her letters to the suffering\r\nof sleeplessness, with its concomitant of drowsiness in the day-time.\r\n\r\nThe next letter is on trivial topics, truly; but is none the less\r\nvaluable for the unconscious record which it affords of her domestic\r\ncharacter. The anxiety for her household companion's enjoyment, the\r\ndelight in the kindness that the young folk had shown to each other\r\nand to the poor Christmas guests, the pleasure in the happiness of\r\nother people, are all characteristic features which are of _no\r\ntrivial_ consequence.\r\n\r\n    AMBLESIDE, Jan. 2, '71.\r\n\r\n    I am so sorry for the way you are passing from the old year to\r\n    the new that I cannot help saying so. I ought to be anything but\r\n    sorry, considering what good you are doing--essential,\r\n    indispensable good; but you must be so longing for your own\r\n    quiet, warm home, and the friends around it, that I heartily wish\r\n    you were there.... As for me, my business is to promote, as far\r\n    as possible, the cheerfulness of my household. There really has\r\n    been much fun,--and yet more sober enjoyment, throughout this\r\n    particular Christmas. In my secret mind I am nervously anxious\r\n    about Jenny to whom cold is a sort of poison; but, when she had\r\n    once observed that there was much less cold here than at home, or\r\n    anywhere else that she could be, I determined to say no more, and\r\n    to make the best of it. She said it for my sake, I know (the only\r\n    reason for her ever speaking of herself), and I frankly received\r\n    it as a comfortable saying. She is getting on better than any of\r\n    us expected, and she has been thoroughly happy in exercising our\r\n    hospitalities.... Jenny's brother Frank came for three days at\r\n    Christmas; and Harriet made herself housekeeper and secretary,\r\n    and made Jenny the guest, to set her wholly at liberty for her\r\n    brother. It was quite a pretty sight--they were all so happy!\r\n    There was a kitchen party on Christmas Day; by far the best we\r\n    ever had; for Frank did the thing thoroughly--read a comic tale,\r\n    taught the folk games, played off the snapdragons, and finally\r\n    produced boxes of new and strange crackers, which spat forth the\r\n    most extraordinary presents! All the guests and the servants were\r\n    in raptures with him. The oldest widow but one vowed that \"she\r\n    did not know _when_ she had seen such a gentleman\"--which I think\r\n    very probable. They came to dinner at noon, and stayed till past\r\n    10 P.M. Think of spending those ten hours entirely in the two\r\n    kitchens, and having four meals, in the time! My nieces, _and\r\n    nephews were_ tired! So was I, though I had only the\r\n    consciousness of the occasion.... All this is so good for Jenny!\r\n    and she will like the quiet and leisure that will follow....\r\n\r\n    I am more alive and far less suffering than in the great heats of\r\n    autumn. Your slips and cuttings are very interesting, and I am\r\n    very thankful for them. More of them when (or if) my head is\r\n    worth more. Of course we shall hear when you get home. May it be\r\n    soon!\r\n\r\n    Yours ever, dear friend,\r\n\r\n    H. MARTINEAU.\r\n\r\n\r\n    AMBLESIDE, March 6, '71.\r\n\r\n    _We_ are in a queer state just now. Gladstone turns out _exactly_\r\n    as I expected. I once told some, who are his colleagues now, that\r\n    he would do some very fine deeds--give us some separate measures\r\n    of very great value, and would do it in an admirable manner; but\r\n    that he would show himself incapable of governing the country.\r\n    For two years he did the first thing; and now, this third year,\r\n    he is showing the expected incapacity. Were there ever such means\r\n    thrown away as we see this session? Probably you are out of the\r\n    way of hearing the whole truth of the situation, and I cannot go\r\n    into it here. Suffice it, that Gladstone totters (and three or\r\n    four more), and that several departments are in such a mess and\r\n    muddle that one hardly sees how they are to be brought straight\r\n    again; and all this without the least occasion! One matter, in\r\n    which I feel deep interest, and on which I have acted, is\r\n    prospering, and we have the Government at our disposal; so that\r\n    we hope they will remain in office till we have secured what we\r\n    want; but the more we have to do with Ministers, the weaker we\r\n    find them. And Gladstone is not only weak as a reasoner (with all\r\n    his hair-splitting), but ignorant in matters of political\r\n    principle.\r\n\r\nThe next letter is very characteristic and perfectly true to her\r\nstate of mind with regard to flatterers:\r\n\r\n    May 21, '71.\r\n\r\n    And now you will want to know how Miss ---- and we fared this day\r\n    week. We (she and I) were together only three-quarters of an\r\n    hour; and for part of that time I was too much exhausted to\r\n    benefit much. My impression is that she is not exactly the person\r\n    for the invalid room. But I may be utterly wrong in this. I might\r\n    be misled by the fatiguing sort of annoyance of overpraise--of\r\n    worship in fact. I don't want to be ungracious about what my\r\n    books were to her in her childhood and youth; I am quite ready to\r\n    believe her sincere in what she said. But not the less is it bad\r\n    taste. It must be bad taste to expatiate on that one topic which\r\n    it is most certain that the hearer cannot sympathize in. Also, I\r\n    have much doubt of her being accurate in her talk. There is a\r\n    random air about her statements, and she said two or three things\r\n    that certainly were mistakes, more or less. These things, and a\r\n    general smoothness in her talk, while she was harsh about some of\r\n    the ---- were what I did not quite like. As for the rest, she was\r\n    as kind as possible; and not only kind to me, but evidently with\r\n    a turn that way, and a habit of it in regard to children and\r\n    friends....\r\n\r\n\r\n    June 11, '71.\r\n\r\n    ... Of all odd things, Dean Stanley and Lady Augusta have been,\r\n    by way of a trip, to Paris, from last Monday to Saturday. How\r\n    _can_ they! One would think nothing could take one there but some\r\n    strong call of duty. The least that one must read and hear is\r\n    enough to make one's heart ache, and to spoil one's sleep, and to\r\n    disfigure life till one does not wish to look at it any more. I\r\n    do long to have done with it. I believe it is the first occasion\r\n    in my life of my having felt hopeless of any destiny, individual\r\n    or national.... How badly our public affairs are going! Gladstone\r\n    & Co, are turning out exactly as many of us foresaw. The thing\r\n    nearest my heart (repeal of the acts above alluded to), and more\r\n    important than all other public questions, will do well. It is, I\r\n    believe, secure, in virtue of an amount of effort and devotedness\r\n    never surpassed. You know what I mean. I rest upon that\r\n    achievement--a vital aim with me and others for many years--with\r\n    satisfaction and entire hopefulness, but in all other directions\r\n    the prospect is simply dreary. In that one case, we, who shall\r\n    have achieved the object, have saved Ministers from themselves,\r\n    and from evil councillors. Wherever they have, this year, trusted\r\n    their own wisdom and resources, they have failed, or see that\r\n    they must fail. They would have been _out_ since early in April,\r\n    but for want of a leader on the Conservative side; and they still\r\n    make their party dwindle till there will be no heart or energy\r\n    left in the Liberal ranks--lately so strong and ardent! They may\r\n    be individually clever; but they cannot govern the country. This\r\n    is eminently the case with Gladstone; and it may serve as the\r\n    description of the group. I shall not dare to ask the Arnolds\r\n    about such matters--so thoroughly did they assume, when they went\r\n    away, that all must be right with \"William\" and Co. in the\r\n    Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Nov. 5, '71.\r\n\r\n    ... Mrs. Grote seems to like to open her feelings to me, as a\r\n    very old friend of hers and her husband's. Did I tell you that\r\n    she sent me--to put me in possession of her state--her private\r\n    diary, from the first day of her alarm about her husband's health\r\n    to the day she sent it? It was more interesting than I can say;\r\n    but it brought after it something more striking still. Some\r\n    half-century ago, Jeremy Bentham threw upon paper some thoughts\r\n    on the operation of natural religion on human welfare, or\r\n    _ill-fare_. His MSS. were left to Mrs. Grote (or portions of\r\n    them), and those papers were issued by the Grotes under the\r\n    title, \"_Analysis of the Influence of Natural Religion_, etc.\r\n    etc., by Philip Beauchamp.\" It is a tract of 142 pp. It is the\r\n    boldest conceivable effort at fair play; and in this particular\r\n    effect, it is most striking. At the outset, all attempts to\r\n    divide the \"abuses\" of religion from other modes of operation are\r\n    repudiated at once; and the claim is so evidently sound that the\r\n    effect of the exposure is singular. Well! of course the tendency\r\n    of the exposition is to show that the absolute darkness of the\r\n    Unseen Life supposed must produce a demoralizing effect, and\r\n    destroy ease of mind. There is something almost appalling in the\r\n    unflinching representation of the mischief of the spirit of fear,\r\n    of its torment, and of its damaging effects in creating a habit\r\n    of adulation, in perverting the direction of our desires, in\r\n    corrupting our estimate of good and evil, in leaving us, in\r\n    short, no chance of living a healthy and natural life, but\r\n    rather, making cowards, liars, and selfish rascals of us all. I\r\n    can't go on, being tired; and you will be thinking, as you read,\r\n    that this is only the old story--of the mischiefs and miseries of\r\n    superstition. But there is something impressive in the cheerful\r\n    simplicity with which Bentham tells us his opinion of the sort of\r\n    person recommended to us for a master under the name of God, and\r\n    with which he warns us all of the impossibility of our being good\r\n    or happy under such a Supreme Being. In looking at the table of\r\n    contents, and seeing the catalogue he gives of evil effects of\r\n    belief in the barest scheme of Natural Religion, one becomes\r\n    aware, as if for the first time, of the atmosphere of falsehood\r\n    against which we ought to have recoiled all our lives since\r\n    becoming capable of thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dec. 30, '71.\r\n\r\n    ... I go off rapidly as a correspondent; there is no use blinking\r\n    the fact. I am so slow and write so badly! and leave off _too_\r\n    tired. Oddly enough, this very week one of the _Daily News_\r\n    authorities has been uttering a groaning longing for my pen in\r\n    the service of that paper, as of old. The occasion is a short\r\n    letter of mine in last Thursday's paper, which you may have\r\n    seen.[25] If so, you will see that I had no choice. W. E. Forster\r\n    was at Fox How; and I got Jenny to carry the volume of Brougham\r\n    (vol. iii. p. 302) to consult Forster and Arnolds about what I\r\n    should do, W. E. Forster being in the same line of business with\r\n    my father, and a public man--man of the world. He was clear: it\r\n    was impossible to leave my father under a false imputation of\r\n    having failed. And when my letter appeared, he was delighted with\r\n    it; so are those of my family that I have heard from; and, above\r\n    all, _Daily News_ editors. They hope and believe it will excite\r\n    due distrust of Brougham's representations, and encourage others\r\n    to expose his falsehoods. His suppressions are as wonderful as\r\n    his disclosures; _e.g._ the very important crisis in his career,\r\n    known by the name of the \"Grey Banquet\" at Edinburgh, he cuts\r\n    completely out of the history of the time--perverting Lord\r\n    Durham's story as well as his own. I can see how the false story\r\n    of me and mine got made; but enough of that--especially if you\r\n    have _not_ seen the letter in the _Daily News_. Forster is kindly\r\n    and quiet, but he is altered. He is now--the Courtier!--and odd\r\n    sort of one, with much Quaker innocence and prudence in it; but\r\n    of a sort which leaves me no hope of _his_ handling of his\r\n    Education measure. There will be such a fight! and the\r\n    Nonconformists are right, and know that they are. You will\r\n    probably see _that_ achieved--a real National Education\r\n    established, secular and compulsory.\r\n\r\n          [25] Refuting a statement made in Lord Brougham's\r\n          _Autobiography_ that her father had failed in business.\r\n\r\nThe Ambleside surgeon, who had undertaken, in acccordance with Harriet\r\nMartineau's will, to prepare and transmit her skull and brain to Mr.\r\nAtkinson, died in the year 1872. The following letter shows that the\r\nprogress of time had in no way diminished her willingness to leave her\r\nhead for scientific investigation:\r\n\r\n    AMBLESIDE, April 23, '72.\r\n\r\n    (Shakespere's birthday and Wordsworth's death-day.)\r\n\r\n    DEAR FRIEND,\r\n\r\n    I am not writing about poets to-day, nor about any \"play\" topic,\r\n    nor anything gay, or pretty, or amusing. I write on business only.\r\n\r\n    When you heard of Mr. Shepherd's death, you must, I should think,\r\n    have considered what was to be done in regard to fulfilling the\r\n    provision of my will about skull and brain. It is to inform you\r\n    of this that I write.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Shepherd's assistant and successor is _Mr. William Moore\r\n    King_, a young man who is considered very clever, and is\r\n    certainly very kind, gentlemanly, simple in mind and manners,\r\n    and married to a charming girl (grand-daughter of Martin, the\r\n    artist). Jenny has known them for two years, having called on\r\n    their arrival. I had seen him twice before this last week. I\r\n    wrote to him the other day, to ask him to give me half an hour\r\n    for confidential conversation; and he came when I was quite alone\r\n    for the morning.\r\n\r\n    I told him the whole matter of the provision in my will, and of\r\n    Mr. Shepherd's engagement, in case of his surviving me in\r\n    sufficient vigor to keep his word. Mr. King listened anxiously,\r\n    made himself master of the arrangement, and distinctly engaged to\r\n    do what we ask, saying that it was so completely clear between us\r\n    that we need never speak of it again.\r\n\r\nI may add that Mr. King has shown me the letters in which Mrs.\r\nMartineau made the necessary arrangements with him for his task. Mr.\r\nAtkinson was, however, now residing out of England, and not in a\r\nposition to usefully accept the bequest, so he intimated his desire\r\nto be freed from his promise to undertake the examination of his\r\nfriend's brain. A codicil was added to Harriet Martineau's will,\r\ntherefore, revoking the provision about this matter.\r\n\r\nThe next quotation shows how little the long prospect of death had\r\nchanged her expectations and desires about things supernatural:--\r\n\r\n    November 19, '72.\r\n\r\n    I mean to try to do justice to what I think and believe, by\r\n    avowing the satisfaction I truly feel with my release from\r\n    selfish superstition and trumpery self-regards, and with the calm\r\n    conclusions of my reason about what to desire and expect in the\r\n    position in which each one of us mysterious human beings finds\r\n    him or herself. It is all we have to do now (such as you and I),\r\n    to be satisfied with the conditions of the life we have left\r\n    behind us, and fearless of the death which lies before us. Nobody\r\n    will ever find me craving the \"glory and bliss\" which the\r\n    preachers set before us, and pray that we may obtain. Some of\r\n    them are very good and kind, I know; but they will never create\r\n    any longing of the sort in me. But why should I scribble on in\r\n    this way to you? Perhaps because our new Evangelical curate has\r\n    written me almost the worst and silliest letter of this sort that\r\n    I ever saw. Enough of him then! But I have left myself no room or\r\n    strength for other matters this time. I wanted to tell you about\r\n    the effect--according to my experience--of a second reading of\r\n    _Adam Bede_, Miss Evans' first great novel. A singular mind is\r\n    hers, I should think, and truly wonderful in power and scope. Her\r\n    intellectual power and grace attract and win people of very high\r\n    intellectual quality.\r\n\r\nMiss Jane Martineau was at this time in very delicate health, and,\r\nafter long fluctuations of hope and fear, was compelled to leave her\r\naunt for the winter and go to a warmer climate. Mrs. Martineau's\r\nletters show how cruel was her anxiety for \"my precious Jenny,\" and\r\nare filled with expressions of her feelings about the state of her\r\nbeloved young companion. All this is, of course, too personal for\r\nquotation, but a perusal of it amply confirms the accounts of her\r\ndomestic affection, and the warmth and sensitiveness of her heart.\r\n\r\nThe loss of her niece from her side ultimately compelled the\r\nengagement of a companion, Miss Goodwin, a young lady who became as\r\nmuch attached to Harriet Martineau as did all others who came in\r\nclose relationship with her in those years.\r\n\r\n    May 10th, '73.\r\n\r\n    ... The great event to me and my household is, that Caroline--my\r\n    dear maid and nurse--has seen Jenny.... It was such a pouring out\r\n    on both sides. It would have almost broken Jenny's heart not to\r\n    have seen this very dear friend of ours, when only half an hour\r\n    off. All her longing is to be by my side again. I never\r\n    discourage this; but I don't believe it can come to pass....\r\n    Everybody is kind and helpful; and our admiration of Miss Goodwin\r\n    ever increases.\r\n\r\n\r\n    AMBLESIDE, Sept. 7th, '73.\r\n\r\n    DEAR FRIEND,\r\n\r\n    I am not ungrateful nor insensible about your treating me with\r\n    letters, whether I reply or not. You may be sure I _would_ write\r\n    if I could. But you know I cannot, and why. At times I really\r\n    indulge in the hope and belief that the end is drawing near, and\r\n    then again, if I compare the present day with a year ago, it\r\n    seems as if there was no very great change. I still do not make\r\n    mistakes--or only in trifling slips of memory common enough at\r\n    seventy. Still I have no haunting ideas, no delusions, no\r\n    fears,--except that vague sort of misgiving that occurs when it\r\n    becomes a fatigue to talk, and to move about, and to plan the\r\n    duties of the day. Yet aware as I am of the character of the\r\n    change in me, and confident as I still am of not making a fool of\r\n    myself till I alter further, I now seldom or never (almost never)\r\n    feel _quite_ myself. I have told you this often lately; but I\r\n    feel as if it would not be quite honest to omit saying it while\r\n    feeling it to be the most prominent experience of my life at this\r\n    time. It is not always easy to draw the line as to what one\r\n    should tell in such a case. On the one hand, I desire to avoid\r\n    all appearance of weak and tiresome complaining of what cannot be\r\n    helped; and on the other, I do wish not to appear unaware of my\r\n    failures. I am sure you understand this, and can sympathize in\r\n    the anxiety about keeping the balance honest. There have been\r\n    heart-attacks now and then lately, which have caused digitalis\r\n    and belladonna to be prescribed for me; and this creates a hope\r\n    that the general bodily condition is declining in good proportion\r\n    to the brain weakening.... Miss ---- and her naval partner remind\r\n    me of the pair in the novel that I have read eleven times--Miss\r\n    Austen's _Persuasion_--unequalled in interest, charm and truth\r\n    (to my mind). There is a hint there of the drawback of\r\n    separation; but yet,--who would have desired anything for Anne\r\n    Elliot and her Captain Wentworth but that they should marry? I am\r\n    now in the middle of Miss Thackeray's _Old Kensington_--reading\r\n    it with much keen pleasure, and some satisfaction and surprise.\r\n    There are exquisite touches in it; and there is a further\r\n    disclosure of power, of genuine, substantial, vital power; but\r\n    her mannerism grows on her deplorably, it seems to me. The amount\r\n    and the mode of analysis of minds and characters are too far\r\n    disproportioned to the other elements to be accepted without\r\n    regret, and, perhaps, some fear for the future. But I have not\r\n    read half the book yet; and I hope I may have to recall all\r\n    fault-finding, and to dwell only on the singular value and beauty\r\n    of the picture-gallery she has given us.\r\n\r\nAn incident of this year's (1873) story, which must not be\r\noverlooked, was an offer of a pension made to Harriet Martineau by\r\nMr. Gladstone. She had written sadly of her own sufferings in a\r\nletter to Mrs. Grote, which referred also to Mr. Grote's life, and\r\nthat lady had published the letter. Mr. Gladstone, in delicate and\r\nfriendly terms, intimated to Mrs. Martineau that if pecuniary anxiety\r\nin any way added to her troubles, he would recommend the Queen to\r\ngive her one of the literary pensions of the Civil List. She declined\r\nit with real gratitude, partly upon the same grounds which had before\r\nled her to refuse a similar offer, but with the additional reason now\r\nthat she would not expose the Queen and the Premier to insult for\r\nshowing friendliness to \"an infidel.\"\r\n\r\nThe next letter is mainly domestic, but I am sure that those spoken\r\nof by name in it will not object to publication of references in\r\norder to show Harriet Martineau in her amiable, considerate household\r\ncharacter:--\r\n\r\n    December 6, 1873.\r\n\r\n    DEAR FRIEND,\r\n\r\n    I will not trouble and pain you by a long story about the cares\r\n    and anxieties which make the last stage of my long life hard to\r\n    manage and to bear. If I could be quite sure of the end being as\r\n    near as one would suppose, I could bear my own share quietly\r\n    enough; but it is a different thing watching a younger life going\r\n    out prematurely. My beloved Jenny will die, after all, we think,\r\n    bravely as she has borne up for two years. The terrible East\r\n    winds again got hold of her before she went (so early as\r\n    October!) to her winter quarters; and there are sudden and grave\r\n    symptoms of dropsy. The old dread of the post has returned upon\r\n    me; and I am amazed to find how I can still suffer from fear. I\r\n    am quite unfit to live alone--even for a week; yet I mean to\r\n    venture it, if necessary. Miss Goodwin _shall_ go (to Leeds) for\r\n    Christmas Day, on which the family have always hitherto\r\n    assembled. I will not prevent their doing so now. My niece\r\n    Harriet (Higginson) was to come, as usual, for a month's holiday\r\n    at Christmas; but her mother has lamed herself by a fall, and it\r\n    must be doubtful whether she can be left. Parents protest the\r\n    dear girl shall come, but she and I wait to see. There is nobody\r\n    else; for there is illness in all families, or anxiety about\r\n    illness elsewhere. \"Well! we shall be on the other side of it\r\n    somehow,\" as people say, and it won't matter much then. My young\r\n    cook is wanted on Christmas Day to be a bridesmaid, at\r\n    Nottingham. So I have a real reason for giving up the great\r\n    Christmas party I have given (in the kitchen) every year till\r\n    now. It will be costly giving the people handsome dinners in\r\n    their own homes; but the house will be quiet, and to me the day\r\n    will be like any other day. It is not now a time for much mirth;\r\n    the Arnolds meeting at their mother's grave, my Jenny absent,\r\n    from perilous illness, my brain failing, so that I can do nothing\r\n    for anybody but by money (and not very much in that way). We are\r\n    all disposed to keep quiet--wishing the outside world a \"Merry\r\n    Christmas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    April 15th, 1874.\r\n\r\n    I am reading again that marvellous _Middlemarch_, finding I did\r\n    not half value it before. It is not a book to issue as a serial.\r\n    Yet, read _en suite_, I find it almost more (greater) than I can\r\n    bear. The Casaubons set me dreaming all night. Do you ever hear\r\n    _any_-thing of Lewes and Miss Evans?\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the time over which these letters extend Mrs.\r\nMartineau was subject to fainting fits, in any one of which her life\r\nmight have ended. It was thus necessary for her to have her maid\r\nsleeping in her bed-room. Caroline, the \"dear friend and servant\" for\r\ntwenty-one years, died early in 1875. Her place was filled by the\r\nyounger maid, Mary Anne, whom Caroline had trained. The maid has told\r\nme of her mistress's kindness and readiness to be amused; of the\r\ngentleness of her manner, and the gratitude which she seemed to feel\r\nfor all loving tendance. The next letter gives a glimpse of the daily\r\nlife from the mistress' pen:--\r\n\r\n    Dec. 8, '75.\r\n\r\n    East winds have been abundantly bitter; but this house is\r\n    sheltered from the east and north. We do pity the babes and their\r\n    mothers in the cottages below; and there is no denying that I am\r\n    painfully stupefied by such cold as we have; but my _aides_ and\r\n    my maids are all as well and as happy as if we had the making of\r\n    the season. It is a daily surprise to me to see how Jenny holds\r\n    _out_ and on, without any sort of relapse; yet I _cannot_ rise\r\n    above the anxiety which haunts me in the midst of every night and\r\n    early morning--dread of hearing that she and Miss Goodwin are ill\r\n    with the cold which makes _me_ so ill. By six o'clock I can stay\r\n    in bed no longer. My maid and I (in the same room) turn out of\r\n    our beds as the clock strikes; she puts a match to the fire, and\r\n    goes for my special cup of tea (needed after my bad nights),\r\n    while I brush my hair. I take the tea to the window, and look out\r\n    for the lights (Fox How usually the first) as they kindle and\r\n    twinkle throughout the valley--Orion going down behind Loughrigg\r\n    as day is breaking. Then I get on the bed for half an hour's\r\n    reading, till the hot water comes up. By that time I am in a\r\n    panic about my _aides_; but as soon as I am seated at my little\r\n    table ready for breakfast, in come the dear creatures, as gay as\r\n    larks, with news how the glass stands, out-door and in. Out-door\r\n    (not on the ground) it is somewhere between 32 deg. and 40 deg. at\r\n    present; and in my room (before the fire has got up), from 50 deg. to\r\n    57 deg.. So now you know what our present life and climate are like.\r\n\r\n    After dinner--I must end almost before I have begun! But, have\r\n    you seen, in any newspaper, the address presented to Carlyle on\r\n    his 80th birthday? I had no doubt about subscribing, and my name\r\n    is there. I feel great deference for Masson, who asked me; and\r\n    though I do not agree with all the ascriptions of the address,\r\n    there is enough in which I do heartily agree to enable me to\r\n    sign; so I send my sovereign with satisfaction. I shall not see\r\n    the medal, not even a bronze one (you know Carlyle's is gold). My\r\n    expenses are considerable _at present_ (not always), and I must\r\n    not spend on such an object. The way in which the thing was done\r\n    is delicate. Instead of overwhelming the old man with a\r\n    deputation, the promoters had the packet quietly left at his\r\n    door. It would set him weeping for his loneliness,--that his\r\n    long-suffering, faithful wife did not witness this crowning\r\n    glory. He does love fame (or _did_), and no man would despise\r\n    such a tribute as this; but I think he will find it oppressive.\r\n    What a change since the day when the _Edinburgh Review_ was\r\n    obliged, as Jeffrey said, to decline articles from Carlyle--much\r\n    as he wished to aid him--because the readers could not tolerate\r\n    C.'s writings! And that was after his now famous \"Burns\" article\r\n    had appeared, and founded his fame in America!\r\n\r\n    Did you see that the _Times_ death-list showed, in two days last\r\n    week, thirty-three deaths of persons over 70, eleven of whom were\r\n    over 80? The effect of the cold!\r\n\r\n    ... The sick and aged will die off fast this winter. May I be\r\n    one!\r\n\r\n\r\n    January 25, '76.\r\n\r\n    DEAR OLD FRIEND,\r\n\r\n    It is time that you were hearing from us of the marked increase\r\n    in my illness within the few days since I last reported of\r\n    matters of mutual interest. I will not trouble you with\r\n    disagreeable descriptions of ailments which admit of no\r\n    advantageous treatment. Last week there was, as twice before (and\r\n    now again twice), a copious hemorrhage from some interior part,\r\n    by which I am much weakened. The cause is not understood; and\r\n    what does it matter? I neither know nor much care how it happens\r\n    that I find myself sinking more rapidly than hitherto. All I know\r\n    is that I am fully satisfied with my share of the interest and\r\n    amusement of life, and of the value of the knowledge which has\r\n    come to me by means of the brain, which is worth all the rest of\r\n    us.\r\n\r\n    I have not much pain, none very severe, but much discomfort. At\r\n    times I _see_ very badly, and _hear_ almost nothing; and then I\r\n    recover more or less of both powers. There is so much cramp in\r\n    the hands, and elsewhere, that it seems very doubtful whether you\r\n    and other friends will hear much from me during the (supposed)\r\n    short time that I shall be living. But I do hope you will let me\r\n    hear, to the last, of your interests and pursuits, your\r\n    friendships and companionships, and prospects of increasing\r\n    wisdom. I cannot write more to-day. Perhaps I may become able\r\n    another day. My beloved niece Jenny is well; better here than she\r\n    would be anywhere else, and more happy in her restoration to her\r\n    home with me than I can describe. I could easily show you how and\r\n    why my death within a short time may be for the happiness of some\r\n    whom I love, and who love me; and if it should be the severest\r\n    trial to this most dear helper of my latter days, I am sure she\r\n    will bear it wisely and well. It cannot but be the happiest\r\n    thought in her mind and heart--what a blessing she has been to my\r\n    old age! What have not _you_ been, dear friend! I must not enter\r\n    on that now. Jenny observed this morning that old or delicate\r\n    people live wonderfully long. True! but I hope my term will be\r\n    short, if I am to continue as ill as at present.\r\n\r\nThe end was, indeed, approaching; and now, when at the worst of her\r\nillness, it so came about that she was asked and consented to do one\r\nlast piece of writing for publication. Her young companion, Miss\r\nGoodwin, had translated Pauli's _Simon de Montfort_, and Mr. Truebner,\r\nunaware of course, how ill Mrs. Martineau was, offered to publish the\r\ntranslation on the condition that she would write an introduction.\r\nShe would not refuse this favor to Miss Goodwin, and did the work\r\nwith great difficulty. It was characteristic that she should think it\r\nnecessary to take the trouble to _read_ the whole MS. before writing\r\nher few pages of introduction.\r\n\r\nShe was now nearing her seventy-fourth birthday; and the strong\r\nconstitution which had worn through so much pain and labor had almost\r\nexhausted its vitality.\r\n\r\nEven in these last weeks she could not be idle. Her hands were\r\ncramped, her eyes weak, her sensations of fatigue very hard to bear;\r\nstill, she not only continued her correspondence with one or two of\r\nher dearest friends, but also went on with her fancy work. The latter\r\nwas now of that easiest kind, requiring least effort of eye and\r\nthought--knitting. She occupied herself with making cot blankets, in\r\ndouble knitting, for the babies of her young friends; some of them\r\namong her poorer neighbors, whom she had known when they were little\r\nchildren themselves and she came first to Ambleside, others among\r\nmore distant and wealthier couples. She finished one blanket early in\r\nthe year 1876, for a baby born in Ambleside in the January, and she\r\nleft a second one unfinished when she died.\r\n\r\nBabies were an unfailing delight to her, to the end. Her maids knew\r\nthat even if she were too ill to see grown-up visitors, a little\r\nchild was always a welcome guest, for at least a few moments. Her\r\nletters to children were altogether charming, and so were her ways\r\nwith them, and children always loved her with all their wise little\r\nhearts. She was a pleasant old lady, even for them to look at. The\r\nexpression of the countenance became very gentle and motherly, when\r\nthe strife of working life was laid aside; the eyes were ever kind;\r\nand the mouth loved to laugh, sternly and firmly though it could at\r\ntimes be compressed. She wore a large cap of delicate lace, and was\r\ndainty about her person, as regarded the fairest cleanliness. Plain\r\nin her youth and middle life, she had now grown into a beautiful old\r\nage--beauty of the kind which such years can gain from the impress on\r\nthe features of the high thoughts and elevated emotions of the past,\r\nwith patience, lovingness, and serenity in the present.\r\n\r\nPatient, loving, and serene the last years of Harriet Martineau were.\r\nThose who lived with her knew less than her correspondents of what\r\nshe suffered; for she felt it a duty to tell the absent what they\r\ncould not see for themselves of her state; but to her household she\r\nspoke but seldom, comparatively, of her painful sensations, leaving\r\nthe matter to their own observation. She could be absorbed to the\r\nlast in all that concerned the world and mankind; and she was equally\r\naccessible to the smaller and more homely interests of the quiet\r\ndaily life of her inmates. The incidents which go to show what she\r\nwas in her domestic circle are but trifling; but what is it that\r\nmakes the difference between an intolerable and a venerable old age\r\n(or youth, for the matter of that, in domestic life) except its\r\nconduct about trifles? One who was with her tells of her delight when\r\na basket of newly-fledged ducklings was brought to her bedside,\r\nbefore she was up, on St. Valentine's Day in the year of her death,\r\noffering her a doggerel tribute as follows:--\r\n\r\n    St. Valentine hopes you will not scorn\r\n    This little gift on St. Valentine's morn.\r\n    We'd have come with the chime of last evening's bells,\r\n    But, alas! we could not break our shells!\r\n\r\nThen another remembers her amusement when one of her nephews had just\r\nstarted to go to the coach for London, and the doctor, coming in\r\nunannounced, left his hat on the hall table, which the active servant\r\nseeing, and jumping to the conclusion that Mr. Martineau (travelling\r\nin a felt) had left his high hat behind him, rushed off with it to\r\nthe coach-office, half a mile away; so that when the doctor wanted to\r\ngo, his hat was off to the coach; and \"the old lady did laugh so.\"\r\nOnly a week or two before her death, she was merry enough to ask her\r\ndoctor that dreadful punning conundrum about the resemblance between\r\nan ice-cream vender, and an hydrophobic patient--the answer turning\r\non the legend \"Water ices and ice creams\" (water I sees, and I\r\nscreams)--telling him that it was a _professional_ conundrum. At the\r\nsame time she was kind enough to repeat to him the compliments which\r\na visitor of hers had been paying his baby. This was the lighter side\r\nof the aged woman's life, the more serious aspect of which is shown\r\nin some of her letters to Mr. Atkinson. The last of these letters\r\nmust now be given:--\r\n\r\n    AMBLESIDE, May 19, 1876.\r\n\r\n    DEAR FRIEND,\r\n\r\n    Jenny, and also my sister, have been observing that you ought to\r\n    be hearing from us, and have offered to write to you. You will\r\n    see at once what this means; and it is quite true that I have\r\n    become so much worse lately that we ought to guard against your\r\n    being surprised, some day soon, by news of my life being closed.\r\n    I feel uncertain about how long I _may_ live in my present state.\r\n    I can only follow the judgment of unprejudiced observers; and I\r\n    see that my household believe the end to be not far off. I will\r\n    not trouble you with disagreeable details. It is enough to say\r\n    that I am in no respect better, while all the ailments are on the\r\n    increase. The imperfect heart-action immediately affects the\r\n    brain, causing the suffering which is worse than all other evils\r\n    together,--the horrid sensation of not being quite myself. This\r\n    strange, dreamy _non-recognition of myself_ comes on every\r\n    evening, and all else is a trifle in comparison. But there is a\r\n    good deal more. Cramps in the hands prevent writing, and most\r\n    other employment, except at intervals. Indications of dropsy have\r\n    lately appeared: and after this, I need not again tell you that I\r\n    see how fully my household believe that the end is not far off.\r\n    Meantime I have no cares or troubles beyond the bodily uneasiness\r\n    (which, however, I don't deny to be an evil). I cannot think of\r\n    any future as at all probable, except the \"annihilation\" from\r\n    which some people recoil with so much horror. I find myself here\r\n    in the universe,--I know not how, whence, or why. I see\r\n    everything in the universe go out and disappear, and I see no\r\n    reason for supposing that it is not an actual and entire death.\r\n    And for _my_ part, I have no objection to such an extinction. I\r\n    well remember the passion with which W. E. Forster said to me, \"I\r\n    had rather be damned than annihilated.\" If he once felt five\r\n    minutes' damnation, he would be thankful for extinction in\r\n    preference. The truth is, I care little about it any way. Now\r\n    that the event draws near, and that I see how fully my household\r\n    expects my death, pretty soon, the universe opens so widely\r\n    before my view, and I see the old notions of death and scenes to\r\n    follow to be so merely human--so impossible to be true, when one\r\n    glances through the range of science--that I see nothing to be\r\n    done but to wait without fear or hope, or ignorant prejudice, for\r\n    the expiration of life. I have no wish for further experience,\r\n    nor have I any fear of it. Under the weariness of illness I long\r\n    to be asleep; but I have not set my mind in any state. I wonder\r\n    if all this represents your notions at all. I should think it\r\n    does, while yet we are fully aware how mere a glimpse we have of\r\n    the universe and the life it contains.\r\n\r\n    Above all, I wish to escape from the narrowness of taking a mere\r\n    human view of things, from the absurdity of making God after\r\n    man's own image, etc.\r\n\r\n    But I will leave this, begging your pardon for what may be so\r\n    unworthy to be dwelt on. However, you _may_ like to know how the\r\n    case looks to a friend under the clear knowledge of death being\r\n    so near at hand. My hands are cramped and I must stop. My sister\r\n    is here for the whole of May, and she and Jenny are most happy\r\n    together. Many affectionate relations and friends are willing to\r\n    come if needed (the Browns among others), if I live beyond July.\r\n    You were not among the Boulogne theological petitioners, I\r\n    suppose. I don't know whether you can _use_----there? I was very\r\n    thankful for your last, though I have said nothing about its\r\n    contents. If I began _that_, I should not know how to stop.\r\n\r\n    So good-bye for to-day, dear friend!\r\n\r\n    Yours ever,\r\n\r\n    H. M.\r\n\r\nThe internal tumor which was the prime cause of her malady (an\r\nentirely different kind of thing, however, from that which she\r\nsuffered from at Tynemouth), had long been the source of great\r\ninconvenience, compelling her to descend the stairs backwards, and to\r\nspend much time in a recumbent position. The post mortem examination\r\nmade by her medical attendant, at the request of her executors, two\r\ndays after she died, revealed the fact that this tumor was the true\r\ncause of her sufferings. She never knew it herself. Relying on the\r\nstatement of the eminent men whom she consulted in 1855, that it was\r\nthe heart that was affected, she accepted that as her fate. It was,\r\nhowever, the slow growth of a \"dermoid cyst\" which made her linger\r\ntill such an age, through the constant suffering of twenty-one\r\npreceding years.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of June, 1876, she had an attack of bronchitis, and\r\nthough medical treatment subdued this speedily, it exhausted her\r\nstrength greatly. From about the 14th of that month--two days after\r\nher seventy-fourth birthday--she was confined to her room, but still\r\nrose from bed. On the 24th she was too ill to get up. Then drowsiness\r\ngradually increased and in a little while she sank quietly into a\r\ndreamy state, in which she seemed to retain consciousness when\r\naroused, but was too weak to either take food or to speak. At last,\r\non the 27th of June, 1876, just as the summer sunset was gilding the\r\nhills that she knew and loved so well, she quietly and peacefully\r\ndrew her last breath, and entered into eternal rest.\r\n\r\nTruly her death--not only the last moments, but the long\r\nordeal--might stand for an illustration of the saying of the wise men\r\nof old--\"Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing that is right,\r\nfor _that_ shall bring a man peace at the last.\"\r\n\r\nShe was buried amidst her kindred, in the old cemetery of Birmingham;\r\nand upon the tombstone, where it stands amidst the smoke, there is no\r\ninscription beyond her name and age, and the places of birth and death.\r\n\r\nMore was, perhaps, needless. Her works, and a yet more precious\r\npossession, her character remain. Faults she had, of course--the\r\nnecessary defects of her virtues. Let it be said that she held her own\r\nopinions too confidently--the uncertain cannot be teachers. Let it be\r\nsaid that her personal dislikes were many and strong--it is the\r\nnecessary antithesis of powerful attachments. Let it be said that her\r\npowers of antagonism at times were not sufficiently restrained--how,\r\nwithout such oppugnancy, could she have stood forth for unpopular\r\ntruths? Let all that detractors can say be said, and how much remains\r\nuntouched!\r\n\r\nIn the paths where Harriet Martineau trod at first almost alone, many\r\nwomen are now following. Serious studies, political activity, a share\r\nin social reforms, an independent, self-supporting career, and freedom\r\nof thought and expression, are by the conditions of our age, becoming\r\nopen to the thousands of women who would never have dared to claim them\r\nin the circumstances in which she first did so. In a yet earlier age\r\nsuch a life, even to such powers as hers, would have been impossible.\r\nAs it was, she was only a pioneer of the new order of things inevitable\r\nunder the advance of civilization and knowledge. The printing-press,\r\nwhich multiplies the words of the thinker; the steam-engine, which both\r\nfeeds the press and rushes off with its product, and the electric\r\ntelegraph, which carries thought around the globe, make this an age in\r\nwhich mental force assumes an importance which it never had before in\r\nthe history of mankind. Mind will be more and more valued and\r\ncultivated, and will grow more and more influential; and the condition\r\nand status of women must alter accordingly. Some people do not like\r\nthis fact; and no one can safely attempt to foresee all its\r\nconsequences; but we can no more prevent it than we can return to\r\nhornbooks, or to trial by ordeal, or to the feudal tenure of land, or\r\nto any other bygone state of social affairs. More and more it will grow\r\ncustomary for women to study such subjects as Harriet Martineau\r\nstudied; more commonplace will it constantly become for women to use\r\nall their mental faculties, and to exert every one of their powers to\r\nthe fullest extent in the highest freedom. What, then, have we to wish\r\nabout that which is inevitable, except that the old high womanly\r\nstandard of moral excellence may be no whit lowered, but may simply be\r\ncarried into the wider sphere of thought and action?\r\n\r\nIt may do much, indeed, for us that we have had such a pioneer as\r\nHarriet Martineau. It is not only that she lived so that all worthy\r\npeople, however differing from her in opinion, respected and honored\r\nher--though that is much. It is not only that she has settled, once for\r\nall, that a woman can be a political thinker and a teacher from whom\r\nmen may gladly receive guidance--though that is much. But the great\r\nvalue of her life to us is as a splendid example of the moral qualities\r\nwhich we should carry into our widest sphere, and which we should\r\ndisplay in our public exertions.\r\n\r\nShe cared for nothing before the truth; her efforts to discover it were\r\nearnest and sincere, for she spared no pains in study and no labor in\r\nthought in the attempt to form her opinions correctly. Having found\r\nwhat she must believe to be a right cause to uphold, or a true word to\r\nspeak, no selfish consideration intruded between her and her duty. She\r\ncould risk fame, and position, and means of livelihood, when necessary,\r\nto unselfishly support and promulgate what she believed it to be\r\nimportant for mankind to do and believe. She longed for the well-being\r\nof her kind; and so unaffectedly and honestly that men who came under\r\nher influence were stimulated and encouraged by her to share and avow\r\nsimilar high aims. Withal, those who lived with her loved her; she was\r\na kind mistress, a good friend, and tender to little children; she was\r\ntruly helpful to the poor at her gates, and her life was spotlessly\r\npure.\r\n\r\nIs not this what we should all strive to be? Shall we not love\r\nknowledge, and use it to find out truth; and place outspoken fidelity\r\nto conscience foremost amongst our duties; and care for the progress of\r\nour race rather than for our own fame; shall we not be truthful, and\r\nhonest, and upright--and, to this end, brave--in public as in private\r\nlife; and shall we not seek so to bear ourselves that men shall shrink\r\nfrom owning their ignobler thoughts and baser shifts to us, but shall\r\nnever fear to avow high aims and pure deeds, while yet we retain our\r\nwomanly kindness and all our domestic virtues unchanged? All this we\r\nmay know that we can be and do, if we will; for we have seen it\r\nexemplified in the life of Harriet Martineau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Messrs.

One had but to recall the names and\r\ncharacteristics of some of the women with whom it deals,--literary\r\nwomen, like Maria Edgeworth, Margaret Fuller, Mary Lamb, Emily Bronte,\r\nGeorge Eliot, and George Sand; women of the world (not to mention the\r\nother parties in that well-known Scriptural firm), like the naughty\r\nbut fascinating Countess of Albany; and women of philanthropy, of\r\nwhich the only example given here so far is Mrs. Elizabeth Fry,--one\r\nhas but to compare the intellectual qualities of the majority of\r\nEnglish men of letters to perceive that the former are the most\r\ndifficult to handle, and that a series of which they are the heroines\r\nis, if successful, a remarkable collection of biographies. We thought\r\nso as we read Miss Blind's study of George Sand, and Vernon Lee's\r\nstudy of the Countess of Albany, and we think so now that we have read\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Robins Pennell's study of Mary Wollstonecraft, who,\r\nwith all her faults, was an honor to her sex. She was not so\r\nconsidered while she lived, except by those who knew her well, nor for\r\nyears after her death; but she is so considered now, even by the\r\ngranddaughters of the good ladies who so bitterly condemned her when\r\nthe century was new. She was notable for the sacrifices that she made\r\nfor her worthless father and her weak, inefficient sisters, for her\r\ndogged persistence and untiring industry, and for her independence and\r\nher courage. The soul of goodness was in her, though she would be\r\nherself and go on her own way; and if she loved not wisely, according\r\nto the world's creed, she loved too well for her own happiness, and\r\npaid the penalty of suffering. What she might have been if she had not\r\nmet Capt. Gilbert Imlay, who was a scoundrel, and William Godwin, who\r\nwas a philosopher, can only be conjectured. She was a force in\r\nliterature and in the enfranchisement of her sisterhood, and as such\r\nwas worthy of the remembrance which she will long retain through Mrs.\r\nPennell's able memoir.\"--_R. H.

Price $1.00.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The almost uniform excellence of the 'Famous Women' series is well\r\nsustained in Mrs. Fenwick Miller's life of Harriet Martineau, the\r\nlatest addition to this little library of biography. Indeed, we are\r\ndisposed to rank it as the best of the lot. The subject is an\r\nentertaining one, and Mrs. Miller has done her work admirably. Miss\r\nMartineau was a remarkable woman, in a century that has not been\r\ndeficient in notable characters. Her native genius, and her\r\nperseverance in developing it; her trials and afflictions, and the\r\ndetermination with which she rose superior to them; her conscientious\r\nadherence to principle, and the important place which her writings\r\nhold in the political and educational literature of her day,--all\r\ncombine to make the story of her life one of exceptional interest....\r\nWith the exception, possibly, of George Eliot, Harriet Martineau was\r\nthe greatest of English women. She was a poet and a novelist, but not\r\nas such did she make good her title to distinction. Much more\r\nnoteworthy were her achievements in other lines of thought, not\r\nusually essayed by women. She was eminent as a political economist, a\r\ntheologian, a journalist, and a historian.... But to attempt a mere\r\noutline of her life and works is out of the question in our limited\r\nspace. Her biography should be read by all in search of\r\nentertainment.\"--_Professor Woods in Saturday Mirror._\r\n\r\n\"The present volume has already shared the fate of several of the\r\nrecent biographies of the distinguished dead, and has been well\r\nadvertised by the public contradiction of more or less important\r\npoints in the relation by the living friends of the dead genius. One\r\nof Mrs. Miller's chief concerns in writing this life seems to have\r\nbeen to redeem the character of Harriet Martineau from the appearance\r\nof hardness and unamiability with which her own autobiography\r\nimpresses the reader.... Mrs. Miller, however, succeeds in this volume\r\nin showing us an altogether different side to her character,--a\r\nhome-loving, neighborly, bright-natured, tender-hearted, witty,\r\nlovable, and altogether womanly woman, as well as the clear thinker,\r\nthe philosophical reasoner, and comprehensive writer whom we already\r\nknew.\"--_The Index._\r\n\r\n\"Already ten volumes in this library are published; namely, George\r\nEliot, Emily Bronte, George Sand, Mary Lamb, Margaret Fuller, Maria\r\nEdgeworth, Elizabeth Fry, The Countess of Albany, Mary Wollstonecraft,\r\nand the present volume. Surely a galaxy of wit and wealth of no mean\r\norder! Miss M. will rank with any of them in womanliness or gifts or\r\ngrace. At home or abroad, in public or private. She was noble and\r\ntrue, and her life stands confessed a success. True, she was literary,\r\nbut she was a home lover and home builder. She never lost the higher\r\naims and ends of life, no matter how flattering her success. This\r\nwhole series ought to be read by the young ladies of to-day. More of\r\nsuch biography would prove highly beneficial.\"--_Troy Telegram._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Our publications are for sale by all booksellers, or will be mailed,\r\npost-paid, on receipt of price._\r\n\r\nROBERTS BROTHERS, BOSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRACHEL.\r\n\r\nBy Mrs. NINA H. KENNARD.\r\n\r\nOne Volume. 16mo. Cloth. Price, $1.00.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Rachel_, by Nina H. Kennard, is an interesting sketch of the famous\r\nwoman whose passion and genius won for her an almost unrivalled fame\r\nas an actress. The story of Rachel's career is of the most brilliant\r\nsuccess in art and of the most pathetic failure in character. Her\r\nfaults, many and grievous, are overlooked in this volume, and the\r\nbetter aspects of her nature and history are recorded.\"--_Hartford\r\nCourant._\r\n\r\n\"The book is well planned, has been carefully constructed, and is\r\npleasantly written.\"--_The Critic._\r\n\r\n\"The life of Mlle. Elisa Rachel Felix has never been adequately told,\r\nand the appearance of her biography in the 'Famous Women Series' of\r\nMessrs. Roberts Brothers will be welcomed.... Yet we must be glad the\r\nbook is written, and welcome it to a place among the minor\r\nbiographies; and because there is nothing else so good, the volume is\r\nindispensable to library and study.\"--_Boston Evening Traveller._\r\n\r\n\"Another life of the great actress Rachel has been written. It forms\r\npart of the 'Famous Women Series,' which that firm is now bringing\r\nout, and which already includes eleven volumes. Mrs. Kennard deals\r\nwith her subject much more amiably than one or two of the other\r\nbiographers have done. She has none of those vindictive feelings which\r\nare so obvious in Madame B.'s narrative of the great tragedienne. On\r\nthe contrary, she wants to be fair, and she probably is as fair as the\r\nmaterials which came into her possession enabled her to be. The\r\nendeavor has been made to show us Rachel as she really was, by relying\r\nto a great extent upon her letters.... A good many stories that we are\r\nfamiliar with are repeated, and some are contradicted. From first to\r\nlast, however, the sympathy of the author is ardent, whether she\r\nrecounts the misery of Rachel's childhood, or the splendid altitude to\r\nwhich she climbed when her name echoed through the world and the great\r\nones of the earth vied in doing her homage. On this account Mrs.\r\nKennard's book is a welcome addition to the pre-existing biographies\r\nof one of the greatest actresses the world ever saw.\"--_N.Y.

Cloth. Price, $1.00.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Of all the interesting biographies published in the Famous Women\r\nSeries, Mathilde Blind's life of Mme. Roland is by far the most\r\nfascinating.... But no one can read Mme. Roland's thrilling story, and\r\nno one can study the character of this noble, heroic woman without\r\nfeeling certain that it is good for the world to have every incident\r\nof her life brought again before the public eye. Among the famous\r\nwomen who have been enjoying a new birth through this set of short\r\nbiographies, no single one has been worthy of the adjective _great_\r\nuntil we come to Mme. Roland....\r\n\r\n\"We see a brilliant intellectual woman in Mme. Roland; we see a\r\ndutiful daughter and devoted wife; we see a woman going forth bravely\r\nto place her neck under the guillotine,--a woman who had been known as\r\nthe 'Soul of the Girondins;' and we see a woman struggling with and\r\nnot being overcome by an intense and passionate love. Has history a\r\nmore heroic picture to present us with? Is there any woman more\r\ndeserving of the adjective 'great'?\r\n\r\n\"Mathilde Blind has had rich materials from which to draw for Mme.\r\nRoland's biography. She writes graphically, and describes some of the\r\nterrible scenes in the French Revolution with great picturesqueness.\r\nThe writer's sympathy with Mme. Roland and her enthusiasm is very\r\ncontagious; and we follow her record almost breathlessly, and with\r\nintense feeling turn over the last few pages of this little volume. No\r\none can doubt that this life was worth the writing, and even earnest\r\nstudents of the French Revolution will be glad to refresh their\r\nmemories of Lamartine's 'History of the Girondins,' and again have\r\nbrought vividly before them the terrible tragedy of Mme. Roland's life\r\nand death.\"--_Boston Evening Transcript._\r\n\r\n\"The thrilling story of Madame Roland's genius, nobility,\r\nself-sacrifice, and death loses nothing in its retelling here. The\r\nmaterial has been collected and arranged in an unbroken and skilfully\r\nnarrated sketch, each picturesque or exciting incident being brought\r\nout into a strong light The book is one of the best in an excellent\r\nseries.\"--_Christian Union._\r\n\r\n\r\n_For sale by all booksellers.
