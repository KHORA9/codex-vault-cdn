For that,\r\nhaving from my first youth unto this present been beyond measure\r\ninflamed with a very high and noble passion (higher and nobler,\r\nperchance, than might appear, were I to relate it, to sort with my low\r\nestate) albeit by persons of discretion who had intelligence thereof I\r\nwas commended therefor and accounted so much the more worth, natheless\r\na passing sore travail it was to me to bear it, not, certes, by reason\r\nof the cruelty of the beloved lady, but because of the exceeding\r\nardour begotten in my breast of an ill-ordered appetite, for which,\r\nfor that it suffered me not to stand content at any reasonable bounds,\r\ncaused me ofttimes feel more chagrin than I had occasion for. In this\r\nmy affliction the pleasant discourse of a certain friend of mine and\r\nhis admirable consolations afforded me such refreshment that I firmly\r\nbelieve of these it came that I died not. But, as it pleased Him who,\r\nbeing Himself infinite, hath for immutable law appointed unto all\r\nthings mundane that they shall have an end, my love,--beyond every\r\nother fervent and which nor stress of reasoning nor counsel, no, nor\r\nyet manifest shame nor peril that might ensue thereof, had availed\r\neither to break or to bend,--of its own motion, in process of time, on\r\nsuch wise abated that of itself at this present it hath left me only\r\nthat pleasance which it is used to afford unto whoso adventureth\r\nhimself not too far in the navigation of its profounder oceans; by\r\nreason whereof, all chagrin being done away, I feel it grown\r\ndelightsome, whereas it used to be grievous. Yet, albeit the pain hath\r\nceased, not, therefore, is the memory fled of the benefits whilom\r\nreceived and the kindnesses bestowed on me by those to whom, of the\r\ngoodwill they bore me, my troubles were grievous; nor, as I deem, will\r\nit ever pass away, save for death. And for that gratitude, to my\r\nthinking, is, among the other virtues, especially commendable and its\r\ncontrary blameworthy, I have, that I may not appear ungrateful,\r\nbethought myself, now that I can call myself free, to endeavour, in\r\nthat little which is possible to me, to afford some relief, in\r\nrequital of that which I received aforetime,--if not to those who\r\nsuccoured me and who, belike, by reason of their good sense or of\r\ntheir fortune, have no occasion therefor,--to those, at least, who\r\nstand in need thereof. And albeit my support, or rather I should say\r\nmy comfort, may be and indeed is of little enough avail to the\r\nafflicted, natheless meseemeth it should rather be proffered whereas\r\nthe need appeareth greater, as well because it will there do more\r\nservice as for that it will still be there the liefer had. And who\r\nwill deny that this [comfort], whatsoever [worth] it be, it behoveth\r\nmuch more to give unto lovesick ladies than unto men? For that these\r\nwithin their tender bosoms, fearful and shamefast, hold hid the fires\r\nof love (which those who have proved know how much more puissance they\r\nhave than those which are manifest), and constrained by the wishes,\r\nthe pleasures, the commandments of fathers, mothers, brothers and\r\nhusbands, abide most time enmewed in the narrow compass of their\r\nchambers and sitting in a manner idle, willing and willing not in one\r\nbreath, revolve in themselves various thoughts which it is not\r\npossible should still be merry. By reason whereof if there arise in\r\ntheir minds any melancholy, bred of ardent desire, needs must it with\r\ngrievous annoy abide therein, except it be done away by new discourse;\r\nmore by token that they are far less strong than men to endure. With\r\nmen in love it happeneth not on this wise, as we may manifestly see.\r\nThey, if any melancholy or heaviness of thought oppress them, have\r\nmany means of easing it or doing it away, for that to them, an they\r\nhave a mind thereto, there lacketh not commodity of going about\r\nhearing and seeing many things, fowling, hunting, fishing, riding,\r\ngaming and trafficking; each of which means hath, altogether or in\r\npart, power to draw the mind unto itself and to divert it from\r\ntroublous thought, at least for some space of time, whereafter, one\r\nway or another, either solacement superveneth or else the annoy\r\ngroweth less. Wherefore, to the end that the unright of Fortune may by\r\nme in part be amended, which, where there is the less strength to\r\nendure, as we see it in delicate ladies, hath there been the more\r\nniggard of support, I purpose, for the succour and solace of ladies in\r\nlove (unto others[1] the needle and the spindle and the reel suffice)\r\nto recount an hundred stories or fables or parables or histories or\r\nwhatever you like to style them, in ten days' time related by an\r\nhonourable company of seven ladies and three young men made in the\r\ndays of the late deadly pestilence, together with sundry canzonets\r\nsung by the aforesaid ladies for their diversion. In these stories\r\nwill be found love-chances,[2] both gladsome and grievous, and other\r\naccidents of fortune befallen as well in times present as in days of\r\nold, whereof the ladies aforesaid, who shall read them, may at once\r\ntake solace from the delectable things therein shown forth and useful\r\ncounsel, inasmuch as they may learn thereby what is to be eschewed and\r\nwhat is on like wise to be ensued,--the which methinketh cannot betide\r\nwithout cease of chagrin. If it happen thus (as God grant it may) let\r\nthem render thanks therefor to Love, who, by loosing me from his\r\nbonds, hath vouchsafed me the power of applying myself to the service\r\nof their pleasures.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _i.e._ those not in love.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Syn. adventures (_casi_).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Day the First_\r\n\r\n     HERE BEGINNETH THE FIRST DAY OF THE DECAMERON WHEREIN (AFTER\r\n     DEMONSTRATION MADE BY THE AUTHOR OF THE MANNER IN WHICH IT\r\n     CAME TO PASS THAT THE PERSONS WHO ARE HEREINAFTER PRESENTED\r\n     FOREGATHERED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEVISING TOGETHER) UNDER THE\r\n     GOVERNANCE OF PAMPINEA IS DISCOURSED OF THAT WHICH IS MOST\r\n     AGREEABLE UNTO EACH\r\n\r\n\r\nAs often, most gracious ladies, as, taking thought in myself, I mind\r\nme how very pitiful you are all by nature, so often do I recognize\r\nthat this present work will, to your thinking, have a grievous and a\r\nweariful beginning, inasmuch as the dolorous remembrance of the late\r\npestiferous mortality, which it beareth on its forefront, is\r\nuniversally irksome to all who saw or otherwise knew it. But I would\r\nnot therefore have this affright you from reading further, as if in\r\nthe reading you were still to fare among sighs and tears. Let this\r\ngrisly beginning be none other to you than is to wayfarers a rugged\r\nand steep mountain, beyond which is situate a most fair and delightful\r\nplain, which latter cometh so much the pleasanter to them as the\r\ngreater was the hardship of the ascent and the descent; for, like as\r\ndolour occupieth the extreme of gladness, even so are miseries\r\ndetermined by imminent joyance. This brief annoy (I say brief,\r\ninasmuch as it is contained in few pages) is straightway succeeded by\r\nthe pleasance and delight which I have already promised you and which,\r\nbelike, were it not aforesaid, might not be looked for from such a\r\nbeginning. And in truth, could I fairly have availed to bring you to\r\nmy desire otherwise than by so rugged a path as this will be I had\r\ngladly done it; but being in a manner constrained thereto, for that,\r\nwithout this reminiscence of our past miseries, it might not be shown\r\nwhat was the occasion of the coming about of the things that will\r\nhereafter be read, I have brought myself to write them.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _i.e._ the few pages of which he speaks above.]\r\n\r\nI say, then, that the years [of the era] of the fruitful Incarnation\r\nof the Son of God had attained to the number of one thousand three\r\nhundred and forty-eight, when into the notable city of Florence, fair\r\nover every other of Italy, there came the death-dealing pestilence,\r\nwhich, through the operation of the heavenly bodies or of our own\r\niniquitous dealings, being sent down upon mankind for our correction\r\nby the just wrath of God, had some years before appeared in the parts\r\nof the East and after having bereft these latter of an innumerable\r\nnumber of inhabitants, extending without cease from one place to\r\nanother, had now unhappily spread towards the West. And thereagainst\r\nno wisdom availing nor human foresight (whereby the city was purged of\r\nmany impurities by officers deputed to that end and it was forbidden\r\nunto any sick person to enter therein and many were the counsels\r\ngiven[4] for the preservation of health) nor yet humble\r\nsupplications, not once but many times both in ordered processions and\r\non other wise made unto God by devout persons,--about the coming in of\r\nthe Spring of the aforesaid year, it began on horrible and miraculous\r\nwise to show forth its dolorous effects. Yet not as it had done in the\r\nEast, where, if any bled at the nose, it was a manifest sign of\r\ninevitable death; nay, but in men and women alike there appeared, at\r\nthe beginning of the malady, certain swellings, either on the groin or\r\nunder the armpits, whereof some waxed of the bigness of a common\r\napple, others like unto an egg, some more and some less, and these the\r\nvulgar named plague-boils. From these two parts the aforesaid\r\ndeath-bearing plague-boils proceeded, in brief space, to appear and\r\ncome indifferently in every part of the body; wherefrom, after awhile,\r\nthe fashion of the contagion began to change into black or livid\r\nblotches, which showed themselves in many [first] on the arms and\r\nabout the thighs and [after spread to] every other part of the person,\r\nin some large and sparse and in others small and thick-sown; and like\r\nas the plague-boils had been first (and yet were) a very certain token\r\nof coming death, even so were these for every one to whom they came.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Syn. provisions made or means taken (_consigli dati_).\r\nBoccaccio constantly uses _consiglio_ in this latter sense.]\r\n\r\nTo the cure of these maladies nor counsel[5] of physician nor virtue\r\nof any medicine appeared to avail or profit aught; on the\r\ncontrary,--whether it was that the nature of the infection suffered it\r\nnot or that the ignorance of the physicians (of whom, over and above\r\nthe men of art, the number, both men and women, who had never had any\r\nteaching of medicine, was become exceeding great,) availed not to know\r\nwhence it arose and consequently took not due measures thereagainst,--not\r\nonly did few recover thereof, but well nigh all died within the third\r\nday from the appearance of the aforesaid signs, this sooner and that\r\nlater, and for the most part without fever or other accident.[6] And\r\nthis pestilence was the more virulent for that, by communication with\r\nthose who were sick thereof, it gat hold upon the sound, no otherwise\r\nthan fire upon things dry or greasy, whenas they are brought very near\r\nthereunto. Nay, the mischief was yet greater; for that not only did\r\nconverse and consortion with the sick give to the sound infection of\r\ncause of common death, but the mere touching of the clothes or of\r\nwhatsoever other thing had been touched or used of the sick appeared\r\nof itself to communicate the malady to the toucher. A marvellous thing\r\nto hear is that which I have to tell and one which, had it not been\r\nseen of many men's eyes and of mine own, I had scarce dared credit,\r\nmuch less set down in writing, though I had heard it from one worthy\r\nof belief. I say, then, that of such efficience was the nature of the\r\npestilence in question in communicating itself from one to another,\r\nthat, not only did it pass from man to man, but this, which is much\r\nmore, it many times visibly did;--to wit, a thing which had pertained\r\nto a man sick or dead of the aforesaid sickness, being touched by an\r\nanimal foreign to the human species, not only infected this latter\r\nwith the plague, but in a very brief space of time killed it. Of this\r\nmine own eyes (as hath a little before been said) had one day, among\r\nothers, experience on this wise; to wit, that the rags of a poor man,\r\nwho had died of the plague, being cast out into the public way, two\r\nhogs came up to them and having first, after their wont, rooted amain\r\namong them with their snouts, took them in their mouths and tossed\r\nthem about their jaws; then, in a little while, after turning round\r\nand round, they both, as if they had taken poison, fell down dead upon\r\nthe rags with which they had in an ill hour intermeddled.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Syn. help, remedy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Accidente_, what a modern physician would call\r\n\"complication.\" \"Symptom\" does not express the whole meaning of the\r\nItalian word.]\r\n\r\nFrom these things and many others like unto them or yet stranger\r\ndivers fears and conceits were begotten in those who abode alive,\r\nwhich well nigh all tended to a very barbarous conclusion, namely, to\r\nshun and flee from the sick and all that pertained to them, and thus\r\ndoing, each thought to secure immunity for himself. Some there were\r\nwho conceived that to live moderately and keep oneself from all excess\r\nwas the best defence against such a danger; wherefore, making up their\r\ncompany, they lived removed from every other and shut themselves up in\r\nthose houses where none had been sick and where living was best; and\r\nthere, using very temperately of the most delicate viands and the\r\nfinest wines and eschewing all incontinence, they abode with music and\r\nsuch other diversions as they might have, never suffering themselves\r\nto speak with any nor choosing to hear any news from without of death\r\nor sick folk. Others, inclining to the contrary opinion, maintained\r\nthat to carouse and make merry and go about singing and frolicking and\r\nsatisfy the appetite in everything possible and laugh and scoff at\r\nwhatsoever befell was a very certain remedy for such an ill. That\r\nwhich they said they put in practice as best they might, going about\r\nday and night, now to this tavern, now to that, drinking without stint\r\nor measure; and on this wise they did yet more freely in other folk's\r\nhouses, so but they scented there aught that liked or tempted them, as\r\nthey might lightly do, for that every one--as he were to live no\r\nlonger--had abandoned all care of his possessions, as of himself,\r\nwherefore the most part of the houses were become common good and\r\nstrangers used them, whenas they happened upon them, like as the very\r\nowner might have done; and with all this bestial preoccupation, they\r\nstill shunned the sick to the best of their power.\r\n\r\nIn this sore affliction and misery of our city, the reverend authority\r\nof the laws, both human and divine, was all in a manner dissolved and\r\nfallen into decay, for [lack of] the ministers and executors thereof,\r\nwho, like other men, were all either dead or sick or else left so\r\ndestitute of followers that they were unable to exercise any office,\r\nwherefore every one had license to do whatsoever pleased him. Many\r\nothers held a middle course between the two aforesaid, not straitening\r\nthemselves so exactly in the matter of diet as the first neither\r\nallowing themselves such license in drinking and other debauchery as\r\nthe second, but using things in sufficiency, according to their\r\nappetites; nor did they seclude themselves, but went about, carrying\r\nin their hands, some flowers, some odoriferous herbs and other some\r\ndivers kinds of spiceries,[7] which they set often to their noses,\r\naccounting it an excellent thing to fortify the brain with such\r\nodours, more by token that the air seemed all heavy and attainted with\r\nthe stench of the dead bodies and that of the sick and of the remedies\r\nused.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _i.e._ aromatic drugs.]\r\n\r\nSome were of a more barbarous, though, peradventure, a surer way of\r\nthinking, avouching that there was no remedy against pestilences\r\nbetter than--no, nor any so good as--to flee before them; wherefore,\r\nmoved by this reasoning and recking of nought but themselves, very\r\nmany, both men and women, abandoned their own city, their own houses\r\nand homes, their kinsfolk and possessions, and sought the country\r\nseats of others, or, at the least, their own, as if the wrath of God,\r\nbeing moved to punish the iniquity of mankind, would not proceed to do\r\nso wheresoever they might be, but would content itself with afflicting\r\nthose only who were found within the walls of their city, or as if\r\nthey were persuaded that no person was to remain therein and that its\r\nlast hour was come. And albeit these, who opined thus variously, died\r\nnot all, yet neither did they all escape; nay, many of each way of\r\nthinking and in every place sickened of the plague and languished on\r\nall sides, well nigh abandoned, having themselves, what while they\r\nwere whole, set the example to those who abode in health.\r\n\r\nIndeed, leaving be that townsman avoided townsman and that well nigh\r\nno neighbour took thought unto other and that kinsfolk seldom or never\r\nvisited one another and held no converse together save from afar, this\r\ntribulation had stricken such terror to the hearts of all, men and\r\nwomen alike, that brother forsook brother, uncle nephew and sister\r\nbrother and oftentimes wife husband; nay (what is yet more\r\nextraordinary and well nigh incredible) fathers and mothers refused to\r\nvisit or tend their very children, as they had not been theirs. By\r\nreason whereof there remained unto those (and the number of them, both\r\nmales and females, was incalculable) who fell sick, none other succour\r\nthan that which they owed either to the charity of friends (and of\r\nthese there were few) or the greed of servants, who tended them,\r\nallured by high and extravagant wage; albeit, for all this, these\r\nlatter were not grown many, and those men and women of mean\r\nunderstanding and for the most part unused to such offices, who served\r\nfor well nigh nought but to reach things called for by the sick or to\r\nnote when they died; and in the doing of these services many of them\r\nperished with their gain.\r\n\r\nOf this abandonment of the sick by neighbours, kinsfolk and friends\r\nand of the scarcity of servants arose an usage before well nigh\r\nunheard, to wit, that no woman, how fair or lovesome or well-born\r\nsoever she might be, once fallen sick, recked aught of having a man to\r\ntend her, whatever he might be, or young or old, and without any shame\r\ndiscovered to him every part of her body, no otherwise than she would\r\nhave done to a woman, so but the necessity of her sickness required\r\nit; the which belike, in those who recovered, was the occasion of\r\nlesser modesty in time to come. Moreover, there ensued of this\r\nabandonment the death of many who peradventure, had they been\r\nsuccoured, would have escaped alive; wherefore, as well for the lack\r\nof the opportune services which the sick availed not to have as for\r\nthe virulence of the plague, such was the multitude of those who died\r\nin the city by day and by night that it was an astonishment to hear\r\ntell thereof, much more to see it; and thence, as it were of\r\nnecessity, there sprang up among those who abode alive things contrary\r\nto the pristine manners of the townsfolk.\r\n\r\nIt was then (even as we yet see it used) a custom that the kinswomen\r\nand she-neighbours of the dead should assemble in his house and there\r\ncondole with those who more nearly pertained unto him, whilst his\r\nneighbours and many other citizens foregathered with his next of kin\r\nbefore his house, whither, according to the dead man's quality, came\r\nthe clergy, and he with funeral pomp of chants and candles was borne\r\non the shoulders of his peers to the church chosen by himself before\r\nhis death; which usages, after the virulence of the plague began to\r\nincrease, were either altogether or for the most part laid aside, and\r\nother and strange customs sprang up in their stead. For that, not only\r\ndid folk die without having a multitude of women about them, but many\r\nthere were who departed this life without witness and few indeed were\r\nthey to whom the pious plaints and bitter tears of their kinsfolk were\r\nvouchsafed; nay, in lieu of these things there obtained, for the most\r\npart, laughter and jests and gibes and feasting and merrymaking in\r\ncompany; which usance women, laying aside womanly pitifulness, had\r\nright well learned for their own safety.\r\n\r\nFew, again, were they whose bodies were accompanied to the church by\r\nmore than half a score or a dozen of their neighbours, and of these no\r\nworshipful and illustrious citizens, but a sort of blood-suckers,\r\nsprung from the dregs of the people, who styled themselves\r\n_pickmen_[8] and did such offices for hire, shouldered the bier and\r\nbore it with hurried steps, not to that church which the dead man had\r\nchosen before his death, but most times to the nearest, behind five or\r\nsix[9] priests, with little light[10] and whiles none at all, which\r\nlatter, with the aid of the said pickmen, thrust him into what grave\r\nsoever they first found unoccupied, without troubling themselves with\r\ntoo long or too formal a service.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: _i.e._ gravediggers (_becchini_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Lit. _four_ or six. This is the equivalent Italian\r\nidiom.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _i.e._ but few tapers.]\r\n\r\nThe condition of the common people (and belike, in great part, of the\r\nmiddle class also) was yet more pitiable to behold, for that these,\r\nfor the most part retained by hope[11] or poverty in their houses and\r\nabiding in their own quarters, sickened by the thousand daily and\r\nbeing altogether untended and unsuccoured, died well nigh all without\r\nrecourse. Many breathed their last in the open street, whilst other\r\nmany, for all they died in their houses, made it known to the\r\nneighbours that they were dead rather by the stench of their rotting\r\nbodies than otherwise; and of these and others who died all about the\r\nwhole city was full. For the most part one same usance was observed by\r\nthe neighbours, moved more by fear lest the corruption of the dead\r\nbodies should imperil themselves than by any charity they had for the\r\ndeparted; to wit, that either with their own hands or with the aid of\r\ncertain bearers, whenas they might have any, they brought the bodies\r\nof those who had died forth of their houses and laid them before their\r\ndoors, where, especially in the morning, those who went about might\r\nsee corpses without number; then they fetched biers and some, in\r\ndefault thereof, they laid upon some board or other. Nor was it only\r\none bier that carried two or three corpses, nor did this happen but\r\nonce; nay, many might have been counted which contained husband and\r\nwife, two or three brothers, father and son or the like. And an\r\ninfinite number of times it befell that, two priests going with one\r\ncross for some one, three or four biers, borne by bearers, ranged\r\nthemselves behind the latter,[12] and whereas the priests thought to\r\nhave but one dead man to bury, they had six or eight, and whiles more.\r\nNor therefore were the dead honoured with aught of tears or candles or\r\nfuneral train; nay, the thing was come to such a pass that folk recked\r\nno more of men that died than nowadays they would of goats; whereby it\r\nvery manifestly appeared that that which the natural course of things\r\nhad not availed, by dint of small and infrequent harms, to teach the\r\nwise to endure with patience, the very greatness of their ills had\r\nbrought even the simple to expect and make no account of. The\r\nconsecrated ground sufficing not to the burial of the vast multitude\r\nof corpses aforesaid, which daily and well nigh hourly came carried in\r\ncrowds to every church,--especially if it were sought to give each his\r\nown place, according to ancient usance,--there were made throughout\r\nthe churchyards, after every other part was full, vast trenches,\r\nwherein those who came after were laid by the hundred and being heaped\r\nup therein by layers, as goods are stowed aboard ship, were covered\r\nwith a little earth, till such time as they reached the top of the\r\ntrench.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _i.e._ expectation of gain from acting as tenders of the\r\nsick, gravediggers, etc. The word _speranza_ is, however, constantly\r\nused by Dante and his follower Boccaccio in the contrary sense of\r\n\"fear,\" and may be so meant in the present instance.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _i.e._ the cross.]\r\n\r\nMoreover,--not to go longer searching out and recalling every\r\nparticular of our past miseries, as they befell throughout the\r\ncity,--I say that, whilst so sinister a time prevailed in the latter,\r\non no wise therefor was the surrounding country spared, wherein,\r\n(letting be the castles,[13] which in their littleness[14] were like\r\nunto the city,) throughout the scattered villages and in the fields,\r\nthe poor and miserable husbandmen and their families, without succour\r\nof physician or aid of servitor, died, not like men, but well nigh\r\nlike beasts, by the ways or in their tillages or about the houses,\r\nindifferently by day and night. By reason whereof, growing lax like\r\nthe townsfolk in their manners and customs, they recked not of any\r\nthing or business of theirs; nay, all, as if they looked for death\r\nthat very day, studied with all their wit, not to help to maturity the\r\nfuture produce of their cattle and their fields and the fruits of\r\ntheir own past toils, but to consume those which were ready to hand.\r\nThus it came to pass that the oxen, the asses, the sheep, the goats,\r\nthe swine, the fowls, nay, the very dogs, so faithful to mankind,\r\nbeing driven forth of their own houses, went straying at their\r\npleasure about the fields, where the very corn was abandoned, without\r\nbeing cut, much less gathered in; and many, well nigh like reasonable\r\ncreatures, after grazing all day, returned at night, glutted, to their\r\nhouses, without the constraint of any herdsman.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _i.e._ walled burghs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _i.e._ in miniature.]\r\n\r\nTo leave the country and return to the city, what more can be said\r\nsave that such and so great was the cruelty of heaven (and in part,\r\nperadventure, that of men) that, between March and the following July,\r\nwhat with the virulence of that pestiferous sickness and the number of\r\nsick folk ill tended or forsaken in their need, through the\r\nfearfulness of those who were whole, it is believed for certain that\r\nupward of an hundred thousand human beings perished within the walls\r\nof the city of Florence, which, peradventure, before the advent of\r\nthat death-dealing calamity, had not been accounted to hold so many?\r\nAlas, how many great palaces, how many goodly houses, how many noble\r\nmansions, once full of families, of lords and of ladies, abode empty\r\neven to the meanest servant! How many memorable families, how many\r\nample heritages, how many famous fortunes were seen to remain without\r\nlawful heir! How many valiant men, how many fair ladies, how many\r\nsprightly youths, whom, not others only, but Galen, Hippocrates or\r\nÆsculapius themselves would have judged most hale, breakfasted in the\r\nmorning with their kinsfolk, comrades and friends and that same night\r\nsupped with their ancestors in the other world!\r\n\r\nI am myself weary of going wandering so long among such miseries;\r\nwherefore, purposing henceforth to leave such part thereof as I can\r\nfitly, I say that,--our city being at this pass, well nigh void of\r\ninhabitants,--it chanced (as I afterward heard from a person worthy of\r\ncredit) that there foregathered in the venerable church of Santa Maria\r\nNovella, one Tuesday morning when there was well nigh none else there,\r\nseven young ladies, all knit one to another by friendship or\r\nneighbourhood or kinship, who had heard divine service in mourning\r\nattire, as sorted with such a season. Not one of them had passed her\r\neight-and-twentieth year nor was less than eighteen years old, and\r\neach was discreet and of noble blood, fair of favour and well-mannered\r\nand full of honest sprightliness. The names of these ladies I would in\r\nproper terms set out, did not just cause forbid me, to wit, that I\r\nwould not have it possible that, in time to come, any of them should\r\ntake shame by reason of the things hereinafter related as being told\r\nor hearkened by them, the laws of disport being nowadays somewhat\r\nstraitened, which at that time, for the reasons above shown, were of\r\nthe largest, not only for persons of their years, but for those of a\r\nmuch riper age; nor yet would I give occasion to the envious, who are\r\nstill ready to carp at every praiseworthy life, on anywise to\r\ndisparage the fair fame of these honourable ladies with unseemly talk.\r\nWherefore, so that which each saith may hereafterward be apprehended\r\nwithout confusion, I purpose to denominate them by names altogether or\r\nin part sorting with each one's quality.[15] The first of them and\r\nher of ripest age I shall call Pampinea, the second Fiammetta, the\r\nthird Filomena and the fourth Emilia. To the fifth we will give the\r\nname of Lauretta, to the sixth that of Neifile and the last, not\r\nwithout cause, we will style Elisa.[16] These, then, not drawn of any\r\nset purpose, but foregathering by chance in a corner of the church,\r\nhaving seated themselves in a ring, after divers sighs, let be the\r\nsaying of paternosters and fell to devising with one another many and\r\nvarious things of the nature of the time. After awhile, the others\r\nbeing silent, Pampinea proceeded to speak thus:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Or character (_qualità_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: I know of no explanation of these names by the\r\ncommentators, who seem, indeed, after the manner of their kind, to\r\nhave generally confined themselves to the elaborate illustration and\r\nelucidation (or rather, alas! too often, obscuration) of passages\r\nalready perfectly plain, leaving the difficult passages for the most\r\npart untouched. The following is the best I can make of them.\r\n_Pampinea_ appears to be formed from the Greek [Greek: pan], all, and\r\n[Greek: pinuô], I advise, admonish or inform, and to mean all-advising\r\nor admonishing, which would agree well enough with the character of\r\nPampinea, who is represented as the eldest and sagest of the female\r\npersonages of the Decameron and as taking the lead in everything.\r\n_Fiammetta_ is the name by which Boccaccio designates his mistress,\r\nthe Princess Maria of Naples (the lady for whom he cherished \"the very\r\nhigh and noble passion\" of which he speaks in his Proem), in his\r\nearlier opuscule, the \"Elégia di Madonna Fiammetta,\" describing, in\r\nher name, the torments of separation from the beloved. In this work he\r\nspeaks of himself under the name of Pamfilo (Gr. [Greek: pan], all,\r\nand [Greek: phileô], I love, _i.e._ the all-loving or the passionate\r\nlover), and it is probable, therefore, that under these names he\r\nintended to introduce his royal ladylove and himself in the present\r\nwork. _Filomena_ (Italian form of Philomela, a nightingale, Greek\r\n[Greek: philos] loving, and [Greek: melos], melody, song, _i.e._\r\nsong-loving) is perhaps so styled for her love of music, and\r\n_Emilia's_ character, as it appears in the course of the work,\r\njustifies the derivation of her name from the Greek [Greek: aimylios],\r\npleasing, engaging in manners and behaviour, cajoling. _Lauretta_\r\nBoccaccio probably intends us to look upon as a learned lady, if, as\r\nwe may suppose, her name is a corruption of _laureata_,\r\nlaurel-crowned; whilst _Neifile's_ name (Greek [Greek: neios] [[Greek:\r\nneos]] new, and [Greek: phileô], I love, _i.e._ novelty-loving) stamps\r\nher as being of a somewhat curious disposition, eager \"to tell or to\r\nhear some new thing.\" The name _Elisa_ is not so easily to be\r\nexplained as the others; possibly it was intended by the author as a\r\nreminiscence of Dido, to whom the name (which is by some authorities\r\nexplained to mean \"Godlike,\" from a Hebrew root) is said to have been\r\ngiven \"quòd plurima supra animi muliebris fortitudinem gesserit.\" It\r\ndoes not, however, appear that there was in Elisa's character or life\r\nanything to justify the implied comparison.]\r\n\r\n\"Dear my ladies, you may, like myself, have many times heard that\r\nwhoso honestly useth his right doth no one wrong; and it is the\r\nnatural right of every one who is born here below to succour, keep and\r\ndefend his own life as best he may, and in so far is this allowed that\r\nit hath happened whiles that, for the preservation thereof, men have\r\nbeen slain without any fault. If this much be conceded of the laws,\r\nwhich have in view the well-being of all mortals, how much more is it\r\nlawful for us and whatsoever other, without offence unto any, to take\r\nsuch means as we may for the preservation of our lives? As often as I\r\nconsider our fashions of this morning and those of many other mornings\r\npast and bethink me what and what manner discourses are ours, I feel,\r\nand you likewise must feel, that each of us is in fear for herself.\r\nNor do I anywise wonder at this; but I wonder exceedingly, considering\r\nthat we all have a woman's wit, that we take no steps to provide\r\nourselves against that which each of us justly feareth. We abide here,\r\nto my seeming, no otherwise than as if we would or should be witness\r\nof how many dead bodies are brought hither for burial or to hearken if\r\nthe friars of the place, whose number is come well nigh to nought,\r\nchant their offices at the due hours or by our apparel to show forth\r\nunto whosoever appeareth here the nature and extent of our distresses.\r\nIf we depart hence, we either see dead bodies or sick persons carried\r\nabout or those, whom for their misdeeds the authority of the public\r\nlaws whilere condemned to exile, overrun the whole place with unseemly\r\nexcesses, as if scoffing at the laws, for that they know the executors\r\nthereof to be either dead or sick; whilst the dregs of our city,\r\nfattened with our blood, style themselves _pickmen_ and ruffle it\r\neverywhere in mockery of us, riding and running all about and flouting\r\nus with our distresses in ribald songs. We hear nothing here but 'Such\r\nan one is dead' or 'Such an one is at the point of death'; and were\r\nthere any to make them, we should hear dolorous lamentations on all\r\nsides. And if we return to our houses, I know not if it is with you as\r\nwith me, but, for my part, when I find none left therein of a great\r\nhousehold, save my serving-maid, I wax fearful and feel every hair of\r\nmy body stand on end; and wherever I go or abide about the house,\r\nmeseemeth I see the shades of those who are departed and who wear not\r\nthose countenances that I was used to see, but terrify me with a\r\nhorrid aspect, I know not whence newly come to them.\r\n\r\nBy reason of these things I feel myself alike ill at ease here and\r\nabroad and at home, more by token that meseemeth none, who hath, as we\r\nhave, the power and whither to go, is left here, other than ourselves;\r\nor if any such there be, I have many a time both heard and perceived\r\nthat, without making any distinction between things lawful and\r\nunlawful, so but appetite move them, whether alone or in company, both\r\nday and night, they do that which affordeth them most delight. Nor is\r\nit the laity alone who do thus; nay, even those who are shut in the\r\nmonasteries, persuading themselves that what befitteth and is lawful\r\nto others alike sortable and unforbidden unto them,[17] have broken\r\nthe laws of obedience and giving themselves to carnal delights,\r\nthinking thus to escape, are grown lewd and dissolute. If thus, then,\r\nit be, as is manifestly to be seen, what do we here? What look we for?\r\nWhat dream we? Why are we more sluggish and slower to provide for our\r\nsafety than all the rest of the townsfolk? Deem we ourselves of less\r\nprice than others, or do we hold our life to be bounden in our bodies\r\nwith a stronger chain than is theirs and that therefore we need reck\r\nnothing of aught that hath power to harm it? We err, we are deceived;\r\nwhat folly is ours, if we think thus! As often as we choose to call to\r\nmind the number and quality of the youths and ladies overborne of this\r\ncruel pestilence, we may see a most manifest proof thereof.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: This phrase may also be read \"persuading themselves that\r\nthat (_i.e._ their breach of the laws of obedience, etc.) beseemeth\r\nthem and is forbidden only to others\" (_faccendosi a credere che\r\nquello a lor si convenga e non si disdica che all' altre_); but the\r\nreading in the text appears more in harmony with the general sense and\r\nis indeed indicated by the punctuation of the Giunta Edition of 1527,\r\nwhich I generally follow in case of doubt.]\r\n\r\nWherefore, in order that we may not, through wilfulness or\r\nnonchalance, fall into that wherefrom we may, peradventure, an we but\r\nwill, by some means or other escape, I know not if it seem to you as\r\nit doth to me, but methinketh it were excellently well done that we,\r\nsuch as we are, depart this city, as many have done before us, and\r\neschewing, as we would death, the dishonourable example of others,\r\nbetake ourselves quietly to our places in the country, whereof each of\r\nus hath great plenty, and there take such diversion, such delight and\r\nsuch pleasance as we may, without anywise overpassing the bounds of\r\nreason. There may we hear the small birds sing, there may we see the\r\nhills and plains clad all in green and the fields full of corn wave\r\neven as doth the sea; there may we see trees, a thousand sorts, and\r\nthere is the face of heaven more open to view, the which, angered\r\nagainst us though it be, nevertheless denieth not unto us its eternal\r\nbeauties, far goodlier to look upon than the empty walls of our city.\r\nMoreover, there is the air far fresher[18] and there at this season is\r\nmore plenty of that which behoveth unto life and less is the sum of\r\nannoys, for that, albeit the husbandmen die there, even as do the\r\ntownsfolk here, the displeasance is there the less, insomuch as houses\r\nand inhabitants are rarer than in the city.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Syn. cooler.]\r\n\r\nHere, on the other hand, if I deem aright, we abandon no one; nay, we\r\nmay far rather say with truth that we ourselves are abandoned, seeing\r\nthat our kinsfolk, either dying or fleeing from death, have left us\r\nalone in this great tribulation, as it were we pertained not unto\r\nthem. No blame can therefore befall the ensuing of this counsel; nay,\r\ndolour and chagrin and belike death may betide us, an we ensue it not.\r\nWherefore, an it please you, methinketh we should do well to take our\r\nmaids and letting follow after us with the necessary gear, sojourn\r\nto-day in this place and to-morrow in that, taking such pleasance and\r\ndiversion as the season may afford, and on this wise abide till such\r\ntime (an we be not earlier overtaken of death) as we shall see what\r\nissue Heaven reserveth unto these things. And I would remind you that\r\nit is no more forbidden unto us honourably to depart than it is unto\r\nmany others of our sex to abide in dishonour.\"\r\n\r\nThe other ladies, having hearkened to Pampinea, not only commended her\r\ncounsel, but, eager to follow it, had already begun to devise more\r\nparticularly among themselves of the manner, as if, arising from\r\ntheir session there, they were to set off out of hand. But Filomena,\r\nwho was exceeding discreet, said, \"Ladies, albeit that which Pampinea\r\nallegeth is excellently well said, yet is there no occasion for\r\nrunning, as meseemeth you would do. Remember that we are all women and\r\nnone of us is child enough not to know how [little] reasonable women\r\nare among themselves and how [ill], without some man's guidance, they\r\nknow how to order themselves. We are fickle, wilful, suspicious,\r\nfaint-hearted and timorous, for which reasons I misdoubt me sore, an\r\nwe take not some other guidance than our own, that our company will be\r\nfar too soon dissolved and with less honour to ourselves than were\r\nseemly; wherefore we should do well to provide ourselves, ere we\r\nbegin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Verily,\" answered Elisa, \"men are the head of women, and without\r\ntheir ordinance seldom cometh any emprise of ours to good end; but how\r\nmay we come by these men? There is none of us but knoweth that of her\r\nkinsmen the most part are dead and those who abide alive are all gone\r\nfleeing that which we seek to flee, in divers companies, some here and\r\nsome there, without our knowing where, and to invite strangers would\r\nnot be seemly, seeing that, if we would endeavour after our welfare,\r\nit behoveth us find a means of so ordering ourselves that, wherever we\r\ngo for diversion and repose, scandal nor annoy may ensue thereof.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst such discourse was toward between the ladies, behold, there\r\nentered the church three young men,--yet not so young that the age of\r\nthe youngest of them was less than five-and-twenty years,--in whom\r\nneither the perversity of the time nor loss of friends and kinsfolk,\r\nno, nor fear for themselves had availed to cool, much less to quench,\r\nthe fire of love. Of these one was called Pamfilo,[19] another\r\nFilostrato[20] and the third Dioneo,[21] all very agreeable and\r\nwell-bred, and they went seeking, for their supreme solace, in such a\r\nperturbation of things, to see their mistresses, who, as it chanced,\r\nwere all three among the seven aforesaid; whilst certain of the other\r\nladies were near kinswomen of one or other of the young men.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: See ante, p. 8, note.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: _Filostrato_, Greek [Greek: philos], loving, and [Greek:\r\nstratos], army, _met._ strife, war, _i.e._ one who loves strife. This\r\nname appears to be a reminiscence of Boccaccio's poem (_Il\r\nFilostrato_, well known through its translation by Chaucer and the\r\nSenechal d'Anjou) upon the subject of the loves of Troilus and\r\nCressida and to be in this instance used by him as a synonym for an\r\nunhappy lover, whom no rebuffs, no treachery can divert from his\r\nill-starred passion. Such a lover may well be said to be in love with\r\nstrife, and that the Filostrato of the Decameron sufficiently answers\r\nto this description we learn later on from his own lips.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: _Dioneo_, a name probably coined from the Greek [Greek:\r\nDiônê], one of the _agnomina_ of Venus (properly her mother's name)\r\nand intended to denote the amorous temperament of his personage, to\r\nwhich, indeed, the erotic character of most of the stories told by him\r\nbears sufficient witness.]\r\n\r\nNo sooner had their eyes fallen on the ladies than they were\r\nthemselves espied of them; whereupon quoth Pampinea, smiling, \"See,\r\nfortune is favourable to our beginnings and hath thrown in our way\r\nyoung men of worth and discretion, who will gladly be to us both\r\nguides and servitors, an we disdain not to accept of them in that\r\ncapacity.\" But Neifile, whose face was grown all vermeil for\r\nshamefastness, for that it was she who was beloved of one of the young\r\nmen, said, \"For God's sake, Pampinea, look what thou sayest! I\r\nacknowledge most frankly that there can be nought but all good said of\r\nwhich one soever of them and I hold them sufficient unto a much\r\ngreater thing than this, even as I opine that they would bear, not\r\nonly ourselves, but far fairer and nobler dames than we, good and\r\nhonourable company. But, for that it is a very manifest thing that\r\nthey are enamoured of certain of us who are here, I fear lest, without\r\nour fault or theirs, scandal and blame ensue thereof, if we carry them\r\nwith us.\" Quoth Filomena, \"That skilleth nought; so but I live\r\nhonestly and conscience prick me not of aught, let who will speak to\r\nthe contrary; God and the truth will take up arms for me. Wherefore,\r\nif they be disposed to come, verily we may say with Pampinea that\r\nfortune is favourable to our going.\"\r\n\r\nThe other ladies, hearing her speak thus absolutely, not only held\r\ntheir peace, but all with one accord agreed that the young men should\r\nbe called and acquainted with their project and bidden to be pleased\r\nbear them company in their expedition. Accordingly, without more\r\nwords, Pampinea, who was knit by kinship to one of them, rising to her\r\nfeet, made for the three young men, who stood fast, looking upon them,\r\nand saluting them with a cheerful countenance, discovered to them\r\ntheir intent and prayed them, on behalf of herself and her companions,\r\nthat they would be pleased to bear them company in a pure and\r\nbrotherly spirit. The young men at the first thought themselves\r\nbantered, but, seeing that the lady spoke in good earnest, they made\r\nanswer joyfully that they were ready, and without losing time about\r\nthe matter, forthright took order for that which they had to do\r\nagainst departure.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, Wednesday to wit, towards break of day,\r\nhaving let orderly make ready all things needful and despatched them\r\nin advance whereas they purposed to go,[22] the ladies, with certain\r\nof their waiting-women, and the three young men, with as many of their\r\nserving-men, departing Florence, set out upon their way; nor had they\r\ngone more than two short miles from the city, when they came to the\r\nplace fore-appointed of them, which was situate on a little hill,\r\nsomewhat withdrawn on every side from the high way and full of various\r\nshrubs and plants, all green of leafage and pleasant to behold. On the\r\nsummit of this hill was a palace, with a goodly and great courtyard in\r\nits midst and galleries[23] and saloons and bedchambers, each in\r\nitself most fair and adorned and notable with jocund paintings, with\r\nlawns and grassplots round about and wonder-goodly gardens and wells\r\nof very cold water and cellars full of wines of price, things more apt\r\nunto curious drinkers than unto sober and modest ladies. The new\r\ncomers, to their no little pleasure, found the place all swept and the\r\nbeds made in the chambers and every thing full of such flowers as\r\nmight be had at that season and strewn with rushes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: _e prima mandato là dove_, etc. This passage is obscure\r\nand may be read to mean \"and having first despatched [a messenger] (or\r\nsent [word]) whereas,\" etc. I think, however, that _mandato_ is a\r\ncopyist's error for _mandata_, in which case the meaning would be as\r\nin the text.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Or balconies (_loggie_).]\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had seated themselves, Dioneo, who was the merriest\r\nspringald in the world and full of quips and cranks, said, \"Ladies,\r\nyour wit, rather than our foresight, hath guided us hither, and I know\r\nnot what you purpose to do with your cares; as for my own, I left them\r\nwithin the city gates, whenas I issued thence with you awhile agone;\r\nwherefore, do you either address yourselves to make merry and laugh\r\nand sing together with me (in so far, I mean, as pertaineth to your\r\ndignity) or give me leave to go back for my cares and abide in the\r\nafflicted city.\" Whereto Pampinea, no otherwise than as if in like\r\nmanner she had banished all her own cares, answered blithely, \"Dioneo,\r\nthou sayst well; it behoveth us live merrily, nor hath any other\r\noccasion caused us flee from yonder miseries. But, for that things\r\nwhich are without measure may not long endure, I, who began the\r\ndiscourse wherethrough this so goodly company came to be made, taking\r\nthought for the continuance of our gladness, hold it of necessity that\r\nwe appoint some one to be principal among us, whom we may honour and\r\nobey as chief and whose especial care it shall be to dispose us to\r\nlive joyously. And in order that each in turn may prove the burden of\r\nsolicitude, together with the pleasure of headship; and that, the\r\nchief being thus drawn, in turn, from one and the other sex, there may\r\nbe no cause for jealousy, as might happen, were any excluded from the\r\nsovranty, I say that unto each be attributed the burden and the honour\r\nfor one day. Let who is to be our first chief be at the election of us\r\nall. For who shall follow, be it he or she whom it shall please the\r\ngovernor of the day to appoint, whenas the hour of vespers draweth\r\nnear, and let each in turn, at his or her discretion, order and\r\ndispose of the place and manner wherein we are to live, for such time\r\nas his or her seignory shall endure.\"\r\n\r\nPampinea's words pleased mightily, and with one voice they elected her\r\nchief of the first day; whereupon Filomena, running nimbly to a\r\nlaurel-tree--for that she had many a time heard speak of the honour\r\ndue to the leaves of this plant and how worship-worth they made whoso\r\nwas deservedly crowned withal--and plucking divers sprays therefrom,\r\nmade her thereof a goodly and honourable wreath, which, being set upon\r\nher head, was thenceforth, what while their company lasted, a manifest\r\nsign unto every other of the royal office and seignory.\r\n\r\nPampinea, being made queen, commanded that every one should be silent;\r\nthen, calling the serving-men of the three young gentlemen and her own\r\nand the other ladies' women, who were four in number, before herself\r\nand all being silent, she spoke thus: \"In order that I may set you a\r\nfirst example, by which, proceeding from good to better, our company\r\nmay live and last in order and pleasance and without reproach so long\r\nas it is agreeable to us, I constitute, firstly, Parmeno, Dioneo's\r\nservant, my seneschal and commit unto him the care and ordinance of\r\nall our household and [especially] that which pertaineth to the\r\nservice of the saloon. Sirisco, Pamfilo's servant, I will shall be\r\nour purveyor and treasurer and ensue the commandments of Parmeno.\r\nTindaro shall look to the service of Filostrato and the other two\r\ngentlemen in their bed chambers, what time the others, being occupied\r\nabout their respective offices, cannot attend thereto. Misia, my\r\nwoman, and Filomena's Licisca shall still abide in the kitchen and\r\nthere diligently prepare such viands as shall be appointed them of\r\nParmeno. Lauretta's Chimera and Fiammetta's Stratilia it is our\r\npleasure shall occupy themselves with the ordinance of the ladies'\r\nchambers and the cleanliness of the places where we shall abide; and\r\nwe will and command all and several, as they hold our favour dear, to\r\nhave a care that, whithersoever they go or whencesoever they return\r\nand whatsoever they hear or see, they bring us from without no news\r\nother than joyous.\" These orders summarily given and commended of all,\r\nPampinea, rising blithely to her feet, said, \"Here be gardens, here be\r\nmeadows, here be store of other delectable places, wherein let each go\r\na-pleasuring at will; and when tierce[24] soundeth, let all be here,\r\nso we may eat in the cool.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: _i.e._ Nine o'clock a.m. Boccaccio's habit of measuring\r\ntime by the canonical hours has been a sore stumbling-block to the\r\nordinary English and French translator, who is generally terribly at\r\nsea as to his meaning, inclining to render _tierce_ three, _sexte_ six\r\no'clock and _none_ noon and making shots of the same wild kind at the\r\nother hours. The monasterial rule (which before the general\r\nintroduction of clocks was commonly followed by the mediæval public in\r\nthe computation of time) divided the twenty-four hours of the day and\r\nnight into seven parts (six of three hours each and one of six), the\r\ninception of which was denoted by the sound of the bells that summoned\r\nthe clergy to the performance of the seven canonical offices _i.e._\r\n_Matins_ at 3 a.m., _Prime_ at 6 a.m., _Tierce_ at 9 a.m., _Sexte_ or\r\nNoonsong at noon, _None_ at 3 p.m., _Vespers_ or Evensong at 6 p.m.\r\nand _Complines_ or Nightsong at 9 p.m., and at the same time served\r\nthe laity as a clock.]\r\n\r\nThe merry company, being thus dismissed by the new queen, went\r\nstraying with slow steps, young men and fair ladies together, about a\r\ngarden, devising blithely and diverting themselves with weaving goodly\r\ngarlands of various leaves and carolling amorously. After they had\r\nabidden there such time as had been appointed them of the queen, they\r\nreturned to the house, where they found that Parmeno had made a\r\ndiligent beginning with his office, for that, entering a saloon on the\r\nground floor, they saw there the tables laid with the whitest of\r\ncloths and beakers that seemed of silver and everything covered with\r\nthe flowers of the broom; whereupon, having washed their hands, they\r\nall, by command of the queen, seated themselves according to Parmeno's\r\nordinance. Then came viands delicately drest and choicest wines were\r\nproffered and the three serving-men, without more, quietly tended the\r\ntables. All, being gladdened by these things, for that they were fair\r\nand orderly done, ate joyously and with store of merry talk, and the\r\ntables being cleared away,[25] the queen bade bring instruments of\r\nmusic, for that all the ladies knew how to dance, as also the young\r\nmen, and some of them could both play and sing excellent well.\r\nAccordingly, by her commandment, Dioneo took a lute and Fiammetta a\r\nviol and began softly to sound a dance; whereupon the queen and the\r\nother ladies, together with the other two young men, having sent the\r\nserving-men to eat, struck up a round and began with a slow pace to\r\ndance a brawl; which ended, they fell to singing quaint and merry\r\nditties. On this wise they abode till it seemed to the queen time to\r\ngo to sleep,[26] and she accordingly dismissed them all; whereupon the\r\nyoung men retired to their chambers, which were withdrawn from the\r\nladies' lodging, and finding them with the beds well made and as full\r\nof flowers as the saloon, put off their clothes and betook themselves\r\nto rest, whilst the ladies, on their part, did likewise.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: The table of Boccaccio's time was a mere board upon\r\ntrestles, which when not in actual use, was stowed away, for room's\r\nsake, against the wall.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: _i.e._ to take the siesta or midday nap common in hot\r\ncountries.]\r\n\r\nNone[27] had not long sounded when the queen, arising, made all the\r\nother ladies arise, and on like wise the three young men, alleging\r\novermuch sleep to be harmful by day; and so they betook themselves to\r\na little meadow, where the grass grew green and high nor there had the\r\nsun power on any side. There, feeling the waftings of a gentle breeze,\r\nthey all, as their queen willed it, seated themselves in a ring on the\r\ngreen grass; while she bespoke them thus, \"As ye see, the sun is high\r\nand the heat great, nor is aught heard save the crickets yonder among\r\nthe olives; wherefore it were doubtless folly to go anywhither at this\r\npresent. Here is the sojourn fair and cool, and here, as you see, are\r\nchess and tables,[28] and each can divert himself as is most to his\r\nmind. But, an my counsel be followed in this, we shall pass away this\r\nsultry part of the day, not in gaming,--wherein the mind of one of the\r\nplayers must of necessity be troubled, without any great pleasure of\r\nthe other or of those who look on,--but in telling stories, which, one\r\ntelling, may afford diversion to all the company who hearken; nor\r\nshall we have made an end of telling each his story but the sun will\r\nhave declined and the heat be abated, and we can then go a-pleasuring\r\nwhereas it may be most agreeable to us. Wherefore, if this that I say\r\nplease you, (for I am disposed to follow your pleasure therein,) let\r\nus do it; and if it please you not, let each until the hour of vespers\r\ndo what most liketh him.\" Ladies and men alike all approved the\r\nstory-telling, whereupon, \"Then,\" said the queen, \"since this pleaseth\r\nyou, I will that this first day each be free to tell of such matters\r\nas are most to his liking.\" Then, turning to Pamfilo, who sat on her\r\nright hand, she smilingly bade him give beginning to the story-telling\r\nwith one of his; and he, hearing the commandment, forthright began\r\nthus, whilst all gave ear to him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: _i.e._ three o'clock p.m.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: _i.e._ backgammon.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the First]\r\n\r\n     MASTER CIAPPELLETTO DUPETH A HOLY FRIAR WITH A FALSE\r\n     CONFESSION AND DIETH; AND HAVING BEEN IN HIS LIFETIME THE\r\n     WORST OF MEN, HE IS, AFTER HIS DEATH, REPUTED A SAINT AND\r\n     CALLED SAINT CIAPPELLETTO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is a seemly thing, dearest ladies, that whatsoever a man doth, he\r\ngive it beginning from the holy and admirable name of Him who is the\r\nmaker of all things. Wherefore, it behoving me, as the first, to give\r\ncommencement to our story-telling, I purpose to begin with one of His\r\nmarvels, to the end that, this being heard, our hope in Him, as in a\r\nthing immutable, may be confirmed and His name be ever praised of us.\r\nIt is manifest that, like as things temporal are all transitory and\r\nmortal, even so both within and without are they full of annoy and\r\nanguish and travail and subject to infinite perils, against which it\r\nis indubitable that we, who live enmingled therein and who are indeed\r\npart and parcel thereof, might avail neither to endure nor to defend\r\nourselves, except God's especial grace lent us strength and foresight;\r\nwhich latter, it is not to be believed, descendeth unto us and upon us\r\nby any merit of our own, but of the proper motion of His own benignity\r\nand the efficacy of the prayers of those who were mortals even as we\r\nare and having diligently ensued His commandments, what while they\r\nwere on life, are now with Him become eternal and blessed and unto\r\nwhom we,--belike not daring to address ourselves unto the proper\r\npresence of so august a judge,--proffer our petitions of the things\r\nwhich we deem needful unto ourselves, as unto advocates[29] informed\r\nby experience of our frailty. And this more we discern in Him, full as\r\nHe is of compassionate liberality towards us, that, whereas it\r\nchanceth whiles (the keenness of mortal eyes availing not in any wise\r\nto penetrate the secrets of the Divine intent), that we peradventure,\r\nbeguiled by report, make such an one our advocate unto His\r\nmajesty, who is outcast from His presence with an eternal\r\nbanishment,--nevertheless He, from whom nothing is hidden, having\r\nregard rather to the purity of the suppliant's intent than to his\r\nignorance or to the reprobate estate of him whose intercession be\r\ninvoketh, giveth ear unto those who pray unto the latter, as if he\r\nwere in very deed blessed in His aspect. The which will manifestly\r\nappear from the story which I purpose to relate; I say manifestly,\r\nensuing, not the judgment of God, but that of men.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Or procurators.]\r\n\r\nIt is told, then, that Musciatto Franzesi,[30] being from a very rich\r\nand considerable merchant in France become a knight and it behoving\r\nhim thereupon go into Tuscany with Messire Charles Sansterre,[31]\r\nbrother to the king of France,[32] who had been required and bidden\r\nthither by Pope Boniface,[33] found his affairs in one part and\r\nanother sore embroiled, (as those of merchants most times are,) and\r\nwas unable lightly or promptly to disentangle them; wherefore he\r\nbethought himself to commit them unto divers persons and made shift\r\nfor all, save only he abode in doubt whom he might leave sufficient to\r\nthe recovery of the credits he had given to certain Burgundians. The\r\ncause of his doubt was that he knew the Burgundians to be litigious,\r\nquarrelsome fellows, ill-conditioned and disloyal, and could not call\r\none to mind, in whom he might put any trust, curst enough to cope with\r\ntheir perversity. After long consideration of the matter, there came\r\nto his memory a certain Master Ciapperello da Prato, who came often to\r\nhis house in Paris and whom, for that he was little of person and\r\nmighty nice in his dress, the French, knowing not what Cepparello[34]\r\nmeant and thinking it be the same with Cappello, to wit, in their\r\nvernacular, Chaplet, called him, not Cappello, but Ciappelletto,[35]\r\nand accordingly as Ciappelletto he was known everywhere, whilst few\r\nknew him for Master Ciapperello.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: A Florentine merchant settled in France; he had great\r\ninfluence over Philippe le Bel and made use of the royal favour to\r\nenrich himself by means of monopolies granted at the expense of his\r\ncompatriots.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Charles, Comte de Valois et d'Alençon.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Philippe le Bel, A.D. 1268-1314.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: The Eighth.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Sic. _Cepparello_ means a log or stump. Ciapperello is\r\napparently a dialectic variant of the same word.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Diminutive of Cappello. This passage is obscure and most\r\nlikely corrupt. Boccaccio probably meant to write \"hat\" instead of\r\n\"chaplet\" (_ghirlanda_), as the meaning of _cappello_, chaplet\r\n(diminutive of Old English _chapel_, a hat,) being the meaning of\r\n_ciappelletto_ (properly _cappelletto_).]\r\n\r\nNow this said Ciappelletto was of this manner life, that, being a\r\nscrivener, he thought very great shame whenas any of his instrument\r\nwas found (and indeed he drew few such) other than false; whilst of\r\nthe latter[36] he would have drawn as many as might be required of him\r\nand these with a better will by way of gift than any other for a great\r\nwage. False witness he bore with especial delight, required or not\r\nrequired, and the greatest regard being in those times paid to oaths\r\nin France, as he recked nothing of forswearing himself, he knavishly\r\ngained all the suits concerning which he was called upon to tell the\r\ntruth upon his faith. He took inordinate pleasure and was mighty\r\ndiligent in stirring up troubles and enmities and scandals between\r\nfriends and kinsfolk and whomsoever else, and the greater the\r\nmischiefs he saw ensue thereof, the more he rejoiced. If bidden to\r\nmanslaughter or whatsoever other naughty deed, he went about it with a\r\nwill, without ever saying nay thereto; and many a time of his proper\r\nchoice he had been known to wound men and do them to death with his\r\nown hand. He was a terrible blasphemer of God and the saints, and that\r\nfor every trifle, being the most choleric man alive. To church he went\r\nnever and all the sacraments thereof he flouted in abominable terms,\r\nas things of no account; whilst, on the other hand, he was still fain\r\nto haunt and use taverns and other lewd places. Of women he was as\r\nfond as dogs of the stick; but in the contrary he delighted more than\r\nany filthy fellow alive. He robbed and pillaged with as much\r\nconscience as a godly man would make oblation to God; he was a very\r\nglutton and a great wine bibber, insomuch that bytimes it wrought him\r\nshameful mischief, and to boot, he was a notorious gamester and a\r\ncaster of cogged dice. But why should I enlarge in so many words? He\r\nwas belike the worst man that ever was born.[37] His wickedness had\r\nlong been upheld by the power and interest of Messer Musciatto, who\r\nhad many a time safeguarded him as well from private persons, to whom\r\nhe often did a mischief, as from the law, against which he was a\r\nperpetual offender.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: _i.e._ false instruments.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: A \"twopence-coloured\" sketch of an impossible villain,\r\ndrawn with a crudeness unusual in Boccaccio.]\r\n\r\nThis Master Ciappelletto then, coming to Musciatto's mind, the latter,\r\nwho was very well acquainted with his way of life, bethought himself\r\nthat he should be such an one as the perversity of the Burgundians\r\nrequired and accordingly, sending for him, he bespoke him thus:\r\n'Master Ciappelletto, I am, as thou knowest, about altogether to\r\nwithdraw hence, and having to do, amongst others, with certain\r\nBurgundians, men full of guile, I know none whom I may leave to\r\nrecover my due from them more fitting than thyself, more by token that\r\nthou dost nothing at this present; wherefore, an thou wilt undertake\r\nthis, I will e'en procure thee the favour of the Court and give thee\r\nsuch part as shall be meet of that which thou shalt recover.'\r\n\r\nDon Ciappelletto, who was then out of employ and ill provided with the\r\ngoods of the world, seeing him who had long been his stay and his\r\nrefuge about to depart thence, lost no time in deliberation, but, as\r\nof necessity constrained, replied that he would well. They being come\r\nto an accord, Musciatto departed and Ciappelletto, having gotten his\r\npatron's procuration and letters commendatory from the king, betook\r\nhimself into Burgundy, where well nigh none knew him, and there,\r\ncontrary to his nature, began courteously and blandly to seek to get\r\nin his payments and do that wherefor he was come thither, as if\r\nreserving choler and violence for a last resort. Dealing thus and\r\nlodging in the house of two Florentines, brothers, who there lent at\r\nusance and who entertained him with great honour for the love of\r\nMesser Musciatto, it chanced that he fell sick, whereupon the two\r\nbrothers promptly fetched physicians and servants to tend him and\r\nfurnished him with all that behoved unto the recovery of his health.\r\nBut every succour was in vain, for that, by the physicians' report,\r\nthe good man, who was now old and had lived disorderly, grew daily\r\nworse, as one who had a mortal sickness; wherefore the two brothers\r\nwere sore concerned and one day, being pretty near the chamber where\r\nhe lay sick, they began to take counsel together, saying one to the\r\nother, 'How shall we do with yonder fellow? We have a sorry bargain on\r\nour hands of his affair, for that to send him forth of our house, thus\r\nsick, were a sore reproach to us and a manifest sign of little wit on\r\nour part, if the folk, who have seen us first receive him and after\r\nlet tend and medicine him with such solicitude, should now see him\r\nsuddenly put out of our house, sick unto death as he is, without it\r\nbeing possible for him to have done aught that should displease us. On\r\nthe other hand, he hath been so wicked a man that he will never\r\nconsent to confess or take any sacrament of the church; and he dying\r\nwithout confession, no church will receive his body; nay, he will be\r\ncast into a ditch, like a dog. Again, even if he do confess, his sins\r\nare so many and so horrible that the like will come of it, for that\r\nthere is nor priest nor friar who can or will absolve him thereof;\r\nwherefore, being unshriven, he will still be cast into the ditches.\r\nShould it happen thus, the people of the city, as well on account of\r\nour trade, which appeareth to them most iniquitous and of which they\r\nmissay all day, as of their itch to plunder us, seeing this, will rise\r\nup in riot and cry out, \"These Lombard dogs, whom the church refuseth\r\nto receive, are to be suffered here no longer\";--and they will run to\r\nour houses and despoil us not only of our good, but may be of our\r\nlives, to boot; wherefore in any case it will go ill with us, if\r\nyonder fellow die.'\r\n\r\nMaster Ciappelletto, who, as we have said, lay near the place where\r\nthe two brothers were in discourse, being quick of hearing, as is most\r\ntimes the case with the sick, heard what they said of him and calling\r\nthem to him, bespoke them thus: 'I will not have you anywise misdoubt\r\nof me nor fear to take any hurt by me. I have heard what you say of me\r\nand am well assured that it would happen even as you say, should\r\nmatters pass as you expect; but it shall go otherwise. I have in my\r\nlifetime done God the Lord so many an affront that it will make\r\nneither more nor less, an I do Him yet another at the point of death;\r\nwherefore do you make shift to bring me the holiest and worthiest\r\nfriar you may avail to have, if any such there be,[38] and leave the\r\nrest to me, for that I will assuredly order your affairs and mine own\r\non such wise that all shall go well and you shall have good cause to\r\nbe satisfied.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: _i.e._ if there be such a thing as a holy and worthy\r\nfriar.]\r\n\r\nThe two brothers, albeit they conceived no great hope of this,\r\nnevertheless betook themselves to a brotherhood of monks and demanded\r\nsome holy and learned man to hear the confession of a Lombard who lay\r\nsick in their house. There was given them a venerable brother of holy\r\nand good life and a past master in Holy Writ, a very reverend man, for\r\nwhom all the townsfolk had a very great and special regard, and they\r\ncarried him to their house; where, coming to the chamber where Master\r\nCiappelletto lay and seating himself by his side, he began first\r\ntenderly to comfort him and after asked him how long it was since he\r\nhad confessed last; whereto Master Ciappelletto, who had never\r\nconfessed in his life, answered, 'Father, it hath been my usance to\r\nconfess every week once at the least and often more; it is true that,\r\nsince I fell sick, to wit, these eight days past, I have not\r\nconfessed, such is the annoy that my sickness hath given me.' Quoth\r\nthe friar, 'My son, thou hast done well and so must thou do\r\nhenceforward. I see, since thou confessest so often, that I shall be\r\nat little pains either of hearing or questioning.' 'Sir,' answered\r\nMaster Ciappelletto, 'say not so; I have never confessed so much nor\r\nso often but I would still fain make a general confession of all my\r\nsins that I could call to mind from the day of my birth to that of my\r\nconfession; wherefore I pray you, good my father, question me as\r\npunctually of everything, nay, everything, as if I had never\r\nconfessed; and consider me not because I am sick, for that I had far\r\nliefer displease this my flesh than, in consulting its ease, do aught\r\nthat might be the perdition of my soul, which my Saviour redeemed with\r\nHis precious blood.'\r\n\r\nThese words much pleased the holy man and seemed to him to argue a\r\nwell-disposed mind; wherefore, after he had much commended Master\r\nCiappelletto for that his usance, he asked him if he had ever sinned\r\nby way of lust with any woman. 'Father,' replied Master Ciappelletto,\r\nsighing, 'on this point I am ashamed to tell you the truth, fearing to\r\nsin by way of vainglory.' Quoth the friar, 'Speak in all security, for\r\nnever did one sin by telling the truth, whether in confession or\r\notherwise.' 'Then,' said Master Ciappelletto, 'since you certify me of\r\nthis, I will tell you; I am yet a virgin, even as I came forth of my\r\nmother's body.' 'O blessed be thou of God!' cried the monk. 'How well\r\nhast thou done! And doing thus, thou hast the more deserved, inasmuch\r\nas, an thou wouldst, thou hadst more leisure to do the contrary than\r\nwe and whatsoever others are limited by any rule.'\r\n\r\nAfter this he asked him if he had ever offended against God in the sin\r\nof gluttony; whereto Master Ciappelletto answered, sighing, Ay had he,\r\nand that many a time; for that, albeit, over and above the Lenten\r\nfasts that are yearly observed of the devout, he had been wont to fast\r\non bread and water three days at the least in every week,--he had\r\noftentimes (and especially whenas he had endured any fatigue, either\r\npraying or going a-pilgrimage) drunken the water with as much appetite\r\nand as keen a relish as great drinkers do wine. And many a time he had\r\nlonged to have such homely salads of potherbs as women make when they\r\ngo into the country; and whiles eating had given him more pleasure\r\nthan himseemed it should do to one who fasteth for devotion, as did\r\nhe. 'My son,' said the friar, 'these sins are natural and very slight\r\nand I would not therefore have thee burden thy conscience withal more\r\nthan behoveth. It happeneth to every man, how devout soever he be,\r\nthat, after long fasting, meat seemeth good to him, and after travail,\r\ndrink.'\r\n\r\n'Alack, father mine,' rejoined Ciappelletto, 'tell me not this to\r\ncomfort me; you must know I know that things done for the service of\r\nGod should be done sincerely and with an ungrudging mind; and whoso\r\ndoth otherwise sinneth.' Quoth the friar, exceeding well pleased, 'I\r\nam content that thou shouldst thus apprehend it and thy pure and good\r\nconscience therein pleaseth me exceedingly. But, tell me, hast thou\r\nsinned by way of avarice, desiring more than befitted or withholding\r\nthat which it behoved thee not to withhold?' 'Father mine,' replied\r\nCiappelletto, 'I would not have you look to my being in the house of\r\nthese usurers; I have nought to do here; nay, I came hither to\r\nadmonish and chasten them and turn them from this their abominable way\r\nof gain; and methinketh I should have made shift to do so, had not God\r\nthus visited me. But you must know that I was left a rich man by my\r\nfather, of whose good, when he was dead, I bestowed the most part in\r\nalms, and after, to sustain my life and that I might be able to\r\nsuccour Christ's poor, I have done my little traffickings, and in\r\nthese I have desired to gain; but still with God's poor have I shared\r\nthat which I gained, converting my own half to my occasion and giving\r\nthem the other, and in this so well hath my Creator prospered me that\r\nmy affairs have still gone from good to better.'\r\n\r\n'Well hast thou done,' said the friar; 'but hast thou often been\r\nangered?' 'Oh,' cried Master Ciappelletto, 'that I must tell you I\r\nhave very often been! And who could keep himself therefrom, seeing men\r\ndo unseemly things all day long, keeping not the commandments of God\r\nneither fearing His judgment? Many times a day I had liefer been dead\r\nthan alive, seeing young men follow after vanities and hearing them\r\ncurse and forswear themselves, haunting the taverns, visiting not the\r\nchurches and ensuing rather the ways of the world than that of God.'\r\n'My son,' said the friar, 'this is a righteous anger, nor for my part\r\nmight I enjoin thee any penance therefor. But hath anger at any time\r\navailed to move thee to do any manslaughter or to bespeak any one\r\nunseemly or do any other unright?' 'Alack, sir,' answered the sick\r\nman, 'you, who seem to me a man of God, how can you say such words?\r\nHad I ever had the least thought of doing any one of the things\r\nwhereof you speak, think you I believe that God would so long have\r\nforborne me? These be the doings of outlaws and men of nought, whereof\r\nI never saw any but I said still, \"Go, may God amend thee!\"'\r\n\r\nThen said the friar, 'Now tell me, my son (blessed be thou of God),\r\nhast thou never borne false witness against any or missaid of another,\r\nor taken others' good, without leave of him to whom it pertained?'\r\n'Ay, indeed, sir,' replied Master Ciappelletto; 'I have missaid of\r\nothers; for that I had a neighbour aforetime, who, with the greatest\r\nunright in the world, did nought but beat his wife, insomuch that I\r\nonce spoke ill of him to her kinsfolk, so great was the compassion\r\nthat overcame me for the poor woman, whom he used as God alone can\r\ntell, whenassoever he had drunken overmuch.' Quoth the friar, 'Thou\r\ntellest me thou hast been a merchant. Hast thou never cheated any one,\r\nas merchants do whiles!' 'I' faith, yes, sir,' answered Master\r\nCiappelletto; 'but I know not whom, except it were a certain man, who\r\nonce brought me monies which he owed me for cloth I had sold him and\r\nwhich I threw into a chest, without counting. A good month after, I\r\nfound that they were four farthings more than they should have been;\r\nwherefore, not seeing him again and having kept them by me a full\r\nyear, that I might restore them to him, I gave them away in alms.'\r\nQuoth the friar, 'This was a small matter, and thou didst well to deal\r\nwith it as thou didst.'\r\n\r\nThen he questioned him of many other things, of all which he answered\r\nafter the same fashion, and the holy father offering to proceed to\r\nabsolution, Master Ciappelletto said, 'Sir, I have yet sundry sins\r\nthat I have not told you.' The friar asked him what they were, and he\r\nanswered, 'I mind me that one Saturday, after none, I caused my\r\nservant sweep out the house and had not that reverence for the Lord's\r\nholy day which it behoved me have.' 'Oh,' said the friar, 'that is a\r\nlight matter, my son.' 'Nay,' rejoined Master Ciappelletto, 'call it\r\nnot a light matter, for that the Lord's Day is greatly to be honoured,\r\nseeing that on such a day our Lord rose from the dead.' Then said the\r\nfriar, 'Well, hast thou done aught else?' 'Ay, sir,' answered Master\r\nCiappelletto; 'once, unthinking what I did, I spat in the church of\r\nGod.' Thereupon the friar fell a-smiling, and said, 'My son, that is\r\nno thing to be recked of; we who are of the clergy, we spit there all\r\nday long.' 'And you do very ill,' rejoined Master Ciappelletto; 'for\r\nthat there is nought which it so straitly behoveth to keep clean as\r\nthe holy temple wherein is rendered sacrifice to God.'\r\n\r\nBrief, he told him great plenty of such like things and presently fell\r\na-sighing and after weeping sore, as he knew full well to do, whenas\r\nhe would. Quoth the holy friar, 'What aileth thee, my son?' 'Alas,\r\nsir,' replied Master Ciappelletto, 'I have one sin left, whereof I\r\nnever yet confessed me, such shame have I to tell it; and every time I\r\ncall it to mind, I weep, even as you see, and meseemeth very certain\r\nthat God will never pardon it me.' 'Go to, son,' rejoined the friar;\r\n'what is this thou sayest? If all the sins that were ever wrought or\r\nare yet to be wrought of all mankind, what while the world endureth,\r\nwere all in one man and he repented him thereof and were contrite\r\ntherefor, as I see thee, such is the mercy and loving-kindness of God\r\nthat, upon confession, He would freely pardon them to him. Wherefore\r\ndo thou tell it in all assurance.' Quoth Master Ciappelletto, still\r\nweeping sore, 'Alack, father mine, mine is too great a sin, and I can\r\nscarce believe that it will ever be forgiven me of God, except your\r\nprayers strive for me.' Then said the friar, 'Tell it me in all\r\nassurance, for I promise thee to pray God for thee.'\r\n\r\nMaster Ciappelletto, however, still wept and said nought; but, after\r\nhe had thus held the friar a great while in suspense, he heaved a deep\r\nsigh and said, 'Father mine, since you promise me to pray God for me,\r\nI will e'en tell it you. Know, then, that, when I was little, I once\r\ncursed my mother.' So saying, he fell again to weeping sore. 'O my\r\nson,' quoth the friar, 'seemeth this to thee so heinous a sin? Why,\r\nmen blaspheme God all day long and He freely pardoneth whoso repenteth\r\nhim of having blasphemed Him; and deemest thou not He will pardon thee\r\nthis? Weep not, but comfort thyself; for, certes, wert thou one of\r\nthose who set Him on the cross, He would pardon thee, in favour of\r\nsuch contrition as I see in thee.' 'Alack, father mine, what say you?'\r\nreplied Ciappelletto. 'My kind mother, who bore me nine months in her\r\nbody, day and night, and carried me on her neck an hundred times and\r\nmore, I did passing ill to curse her and it was an exceeding great\r\nsin; and except you pray God for me, it will not be forgiven me.'\r\n\r\nThe friar, then, seeing that Master Ciappelletto had no more to say,\r\ngave him absolution and bestowed on him his benison, holding him a\r\nvery holy man and devoutly believing all that he had told him to be\r\ntrue. And who would not have believed it, hearing a man at the point\r\nof death speak thus? Then, after all this, he said to him, 'Master\r\nCiappelletto, with God's help you will speedily be whole; but, should\r\nit come to pass that God call your blessed and well-disposed soul to\r\nHimself, would it please you that your body be buried in our convent?'\r\n'Ay, would it, sir,' replied Master Ciappelletto. 'Nay, I would fain\r\nno be buried otherwhere, since you have promised to pray God for me;\r\nmore by token that I have ever had a special regard for your order.\r\nWherefore I pray you that whenas you return to your lodging, you must\r\ncause bring me that most veritable body of Christ, which you\r\nconsecrate a-mornings upon the altar, for that, with your leave, I\r\npurpose (all unworthy as I am) to take it and after, holy and extreme\r\nunction, to the intent that, if I have lived as a sinner, I may at the\r\nleast die like a Christian.' The good friar replied that it pleased\r\nhim much and that he said well and promised to see it presently\r\nbrought him; and so was it done.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the two brothers, misdoubting them sore lest Master\r\nCiappelletto should play them false, had posted themselves behind a\r\nwainscot, that divided the chamber where he lay from another, and\r\nlistening, easily heard and apprehended that which he said to the\r\nfriar and had whiles so great a mind to laugh, hearing the things\r\nwhich he confessed to having done, that they were like to burst and\r\nsaid, one to other, 'What manner of man is this, whom neither old age\r\nnor sickness nor fear of death, whereunto he seeth himself near, nor\r\nyet of God, before whose judgment-seat he looketh to be ere long, have\r\navailed to turn from his wickedness nor hinder him from choosing to\r\ndie as he hath lived?' However, seeing that he had so spoken that he\r\nshould be admitted to burial in a church, they recked nought of the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nMaster Ciappelletto presently took the sacrament and, growing rapidly\r\nworse, received extreme unction, and a little after evensong of the\r\nday he had made his fine confession, he died; whereupon the two\r\nbrothers, having, of his proper monies, taken order for his honourable\r\nburial, sent to the convent to acquaint the friars therewith, bidding\r\nthem come thither that night to hold vigil, according to usance, and\r\nfetch away the body in the morning, and meanwhile made ready all that\r\nwas needful thereunto.\r\n\r\nThe holy friar, who had shriven him, hearing that he had departed this\r\nlife, betook himself to the prior of the convent and, letting ring to\r\nchapter, gave out to the brethren therein assembled that Master\r\nCiappelletto had been a holy man, according to that which he had\r\ngathered from his confession, and persuaded them to receive his body\r\nwith the utmost reverence and devotion, in the hope that God should\r\nshow forth many miracles through him. To this the prior and brethren\r\ncredulously consented and that same evening, coming all whereas Master\r\nCiappelletto lay dead, they held high and solemn vigil over him and on\r\nthe morrow, clad all in albs and copes, book in hand and crosses\r\nbefore them, they went, chanting the while, for his body and brought\r\nit with the utmost pomp and solemnity to their church, followed by\r\nwell nigh all the people of the city, men and women.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had set the body down in the church, the holy friar,\r\nwho had confessed him, mounted the pulpit and fell a-preaching\r\nmarvellous things of the dead man and of his life, his fasts, his\r\nvirginity, his simplicity and innocence and sanctity, recounting,\r\namongst other things, that which he had confessed to him as his\r\ngreatest sin and how he had hardly availed to persuade him that God\r\nwould forgive it him; thence passing on to reprove the folk who\r\nhearkened, 'And you, accursed that you are,' quoth he, 'for every waif\r\nof straw that stirreth between your feet, you blaspheme God and the\r\nVirgin and all the host of heaven.' Moreover, he told them many other\r\nthings of his loyalty and purity of heart; brief, with his speech,\r\nwhereto entire faith was yielded of the people of the city, he so\r\nestablished the dead man in the reverent consideration of all who were\r\npresent that, no sooner was the service at an end, than they all with\r\nthe utmost eagerness flocked to kiss his hands and feet and the\r\nclothes were torn off his back, he holding himself blessed who might\r\navail to have never so little thereof; and needs must they leave him\r\nthus all that day, so he might be seen and visited of all.\r\n\r\nThe following night he was honourably buried in a marble tomb in one\r\nof the chapels of the church and on the morrow the folk began\r\nincontinent to come and burn candles and offer up prayers and make\r\nvows to him and hang images of wax[39] at his shrine, according to the\r\npromise made. Nay, on such wise waxed the frame of his sanctity and\r\nmen's devotion to him that there was scarce any who, being in\r\nadversity, would vow himself to another saint than him; and they\r\nstyled and yet style him Saint Ciappelletto and avouch that God\r\nthrough him hath wrought many miracles and yet worketh, them every day\r\nfor whoso devoutly commendeth himself unto him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: _i.e._ ex voto.]\r\n\r\nThus, then, lived and died Master Cepperello[40] da Prato and became a\r\nsaint, as you have heard; nor would I deny it to be possible that he\r\nis beatified in God's presence, for that, albeit his life was wicked\r\nand perverse, he may at his last extremity have shown such contrition\r\nthat peradventure God had mercy on him and received him into His\r\nkingdom; but, for that this is hidden from us, I reason according to\r\nthat which, is apparent and say that he should rather be in the hands\r\nof the devil in perdition than in Paradise. And if so it be, we may\r\nknow from this how great is God's loving-kindness towards us, which,\r\nhaving regard not to our error, but to the purity of our faith, whenas\r\nwe thus make an enemy (deeming him a friend) of His our intermediary,\r\ngiveth ear unto us, even as if we had recourse unto one truly holy, as\r\nintercessor for His favour. Wherefore, to the end that by His grace we\r\nmay be preserved safe and sound in this present adversity and in this\r\nso joyous company, let us, magnifying His name, in which we have begun\r\nour diversion, and holding Him in reverence, commend ourselves to Him\r\nin our necessities, well assured of being heard.\" And with this he was\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: It will be noted that this is Boccaccio's third variant\r\nof his hero's name (the others being Ciapperello and Cepparello) and\r\nthe edition of 1527 furnishes us with a fourth and a fifth form _i.e._\r\nCiepparello and Ciepperello.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the First]\r\n\r\n     ABRAHAM THE JEW, AT THE INSTIGATION OF JEHANNOT DE CHEVIGNÉ,\r\n     GOETH TO THE COURT OF ROME AND SEEING THE DEPRAVITY OF THE\r\n     CLERGY, RETURNETH TO PARIS AND THERE BECOMETH A CHRISTIAN\r\n\r\n\r\nPamfilo's story was in part laughed at and altogether commended by the\r\nladies, and it being come to its end, after being diligently\r\nhearkened, the queen bade Neifile, who sat next him, ensue the\r\nordinance of the commenced diversion by telling one[41] of her\r\nfashion. Neifile, who was distinguished no less by courteous manners\r\nthan by beauty, answered blithely that she would well and began on\r\nthis wise: \"Pamfilo hath shown us in his story that God's benignness\r\nregardeth not our errors, when they proceed from that which is beyond\r\nour ken; and I, in mine, purpose to show you how this same\r\nbenignness,--patiently suffering the defaults of those who, being\r\nespecially bounden both with words and deeds to bear true witness\r\nthereof[42] yet practise the contrary,--exhibiteth unto us an\r\ninfallible proof of itself, to the intent that we may, with the more\r\nconstancy of mind, ensue that which we believe.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: _i.e._ a story.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: _i.e._ of God's benignness.]\r\n\r\nAs I have heard tell, gracious ladies, there was once in Paris a great\r\nmerchant and a very loyal and upright man, whose name was Jehannot de\r\nChevigné and who was of great traffic in silks and stuffs. He had\r\nparticular friendship for a very rich Jew called Abraham, who was also\r\na merchant and a very honest and trusty man, and seeing the latter's\r\nworth and loyalty, it began to irk him sore that the soul of so worthy\r\nand discreet and good a man should go to perdition for default of\r\nfaith; wherefore he fell to beseeching him on friendly wise leave the\r\nerrors of the Jewish faith and turn to the Christian verity, which he\r\nmight see still wax and prosper, as being holy and good, whereas his\r\nown faith, on the contrary, was manifestly on the wane and dwindling\r\nto nought. The Jew made answer that he held no faith holy or good save\r\nonly the Jewish, that in this latter he was born and therein meant to\r\nlive and die, nor should aught ever make him remove therefrom.\r\n\r\nJehannot for all that desisted not from him, but some days after\r\nreturned to the attack with similar words, showing him, on rude enough\r\nwise (for that merchants for the most part can no better), for what\r\nreasons our religion is better than the Jewish; and albeit the Jew was\r\na past master in their law, nevertheless, whether it was the great\r\nfriendship he bore Jehannot that moved him or peradventure words\r\nwrought it that the Holy Ghost put into the good simple man's mouth,\r\nthe latter's arguments began greatly to please him; but yet,\r\npersisting in his own belief, he would not suffer himself to be\r\nconverted. Like as he abode obstinate, even so Jehannot never gave\r\nover importuning him, till at last the Jew, overcome by such continual\r\ninsistence, said, 'Look you, Jehannot, thou wouldst have me become a\r\nChristian and I am disposed to do it; insomuch, indeed, that I mean,\r\nin the first place, to go to Rome and there see him who, thou sayest,\r\nis God's Vicar upon earth and consider his manners and fashions and\r\nlikewise those of his chief brethren.[43] If these appear to me such\r\nthat I may, by them, as well as by your words, apprehend that your\r\nfaith is better than mine, even as thou hast studied to show me, I\r\nwill do as I have said; and if it be not so, I will remain a Jew as I\r\nam.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Lit. cardinal brethren (_fratelli cardinali_).]\r\n\r\nWhen Jehannot heard this, he was beyond measure chagrined and said in\r\nhimself, 'I have lost my pains, which meseemed I had right well\r\nbestowed, thinking to have converted this man; for that, an he go to\r\nthe court of Rome and see the lewd and wicked life of the clergy, not\r\nonly will he never become a Christian, but, were he already a\r\nChristian, he would infallibly turn Jew again.' Then, turning to\r\nAbraham, he said to him, 'Alack, my friend, why wilt thou undertake\r\nthis travail and so great a charge as it will be to thee to go from\r\nhere to Rome? More by token that, both by sea and by land, the road is\r\nfull of perils for a rich man such as thou art. Thinkest thou not to\r\nfind here who shall give thee baptism? Or, if peradventure thou have\r\nany doubts concerning the faith which I have propounded to thee, where\r\nare there greater doctors and men more learned in the matter than are\r\nhere or better able to resolve thee of that which thou wilt know or\r\nask? Wherefore, to my thinking, this thy going is superfluous. Bethink\r\nthee that the prelates there are even such as those thou mayst have\r\nseen here, and indeed so much the better as they are nearer unto the\r\nChief Pastor. Wherefore, an thou wilt be counselled by me, thou wilt\r\nreserve this travail unto another time against some jubilee or other,\r\nwhereunto it may be I will bear thee company.' To this the Jew made\r\nanswer, 'I doubt not, Jehannot, but it is as thou tellest me; but, to\r\nsum up many words in one, I am altogether determined, an thou wouldst\r\nhave me do that whereof thou hast so instantly besought me, to go\r\nthither; else will I never do aught thereof.' Jehannot, seeing his\r\ndetermination, said, 'Go and good luck go with thee!' And inwardly\r\nassured that he would never become a Christian, when once he should\r\nhave seen the court of Rome, but availing[44] nothing in the matter,\r\nhe desisted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: Lit. losing (_perdendo_), but this is probably some\r\ncopyist's mistake for _podendo_, the old form of _potendo_, availing.]\r\n\r\nThe Jew mounted to horse and as quickliest he might betook himself to\r\nthe court of Rome, he was honourably entertained of his brethren, and\r\nthere abiding, without telling any the reason of his coming, he began\r\ndiligently to enquire into the manners and fashions of the Pope and\r\nCardinals and other prelates and of all the members of his court, and\r\nwhat with that which he himself noted, being a mighty quick-witted\r\nman, and that which he gathered from others, he found all, from the\r\nhighest to the lowest, most shamefully given to the sin of lust, and\r\nthat not only in the way of nature, but after the Sodomitical fashion,\r\nwithout any restraint of remorse or shamefastness, insomuch that the\r\ninterest of courtezans and catamites was of no small avail there in\r\nobtaining any considerable thing.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he manifestly perceived them to be universally gluttons,\r\nwine-bibbers, drunkards and slaves to their bellies, brute-beast\r\nfashion, more than to aught else after lust. And looking farther, he\r\nsaw them all covetous and greedy after money, insomuch that human,\r\nnay, Christian blood, no less than things sacred, whatsoever they\r\nmight be, whether pertaining to the sacrifices of the altar or to the\r\nbenefices of the church, they sold and bought indifferently for a\r\nprice, making a greater traffic and having more brokers thereof than\r\nfolk at Paris of silks and stuffs or what not else. Manifest simony\r\nthey had christened 'procuration' and gluttony 'sustentation,' as if\r\nGod apprehended not,--let be the meaning of words but,--the intention\r\nof depraved minds and would suffer Himself, after the fashion of men,\r\nto be duped by the names of things. All this, together with much else\r\nwhich must be left unsaid, was supremely displeasing to the Jew, who\r\nwas a sober and modest man, and himseeming he had seen enough, he\r\ndetermined to return to Paris and did so.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Jehannot knew of his return, he betook himself to him,\r\nhoping nothing less than that he should become a Christian, and they\r\ngreeted each other with the utmost joy. Then, after Abraham had rested\r\nsome days, Jehannot asked him how himseemed of the Holy Father and of\r\nthe cardinals and others of his court. Whereto the Jew promptly\r\nanswered, 'Meseemeth, God give them ill one and all! And I say this\r\nfor that, if I was able to observe aright, no piety, no devoutness, no\r\ngood work or example of life or otherwhat did I see there in any who\r\nwas a churchman; nay, but lust, covetise, gluttony and the like and\r\nworse (if worse can be) meseemed to be there in such favour with all\r\nthat I hold it for a forgingplace of things diabolical rather than\r\ndivine. And as far as I can judge, meseemeth your chief pastor and\r\nconsequently all the others endeavour with all diligence and all their\r\nwit and every art to bring to nought and banish from the world the\r\nChristian religion, whereas they should be its foundation and support.\r\nAnd for that I see that this whereafter they strive cometh not to\r\npass, but that your religion continually increaseth and waxeth still\r\nbrighter and more glorious, meseemeth I manifestly discern that the\r\nHoly Spirit is verily the foundation and support thereof, as of that\r\nwhich is true and holy over any other. Wherefore, whereas, aforetime I\r\nabode obdurate and insensible to thine exhortations and would not be\r\npersuaded to embrace thy faith, I now tell thee frankly that for\r\nnothing in the world would I forbear to become a Christian. Let us,\r\nthen, to church and there have me baptized, according to the rite and\r\nordinance of your holy faith.'\r\n\r\nJehannot, who looked for a directly contrary conclusion to this, was\r\nthe joyfullest man that might be, when he heard him speak thus, and\r\nrepairing with him to our Lady's Church of Paris, required the clergy\r\nthere to give Abraham baptism. They, hearing that the Jew himself\r\ndemanded it, straightway proceeded to baptize him, whilst Jehannot\r\nraised him from the sacred font[45] and named him Giovanni. After\r\nthis, he had him thoroughly lessoned by men of great worth and\r\nlearning in the tenets of our holy faith, which he speedily\r\napprehended and thenceforward was a good man and a worthy and one of a\r\ndevout life.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: _i.e._ stood sponsor for him.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the First]\r\n\r\n     MELCHIZEDEK THE JEW, WITH A STORY OF THREE RINGS, ESCAPETH A\r\n     PARLOUS SNARE SET FOR HIM BY SALADIN\r\n\r\n\r\nNeifile having made an end of her story, which was commended of all,\r\nFilomena, by the queen's good pleasure, proceeded to speak thus: \"The\r\nstory told by Neifile bringeth to my mind a parlous case the once\r\nbetided a Jew; and for that, it having already been excellent well\r\nspoken both of God and of the verity of our faith, it should not\r\nhenceforth be forbidden us to descend to the doings of mankind and the\r\nevents that have befallen them, I will now proceed to relate to you\r\nthe case aforesaid, which having heard, you will peradventure become\r\nmore wary in answering the questions that may be put to you. You must\r\nknow, lovesome[46] companions[47] mine, that, like as folly ofttimes\r\ndraweth folk forth of happy estate and casteth them into the utmost\r\nmisery, even so doth good sense extricate the wise man from the\r\ngreatest perils and place him in assurance and tranquillity. How true\r\nit is that folly bringeth many an one from fair estate unto misery is\r\nseen by multitude of examples, with the recounting whereof we have no\r\npresent concern, considering that a thousand instances thereof do\r\nevery day manifestly appear to us; but that good sense is a cause of\r\nsolacement I will, as I promised, briefly show you by a little story.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: Lit. amorous (_amorose_), but Boccaccio frequently uses\r\n_amoroso_, _vago_, and other adjectives, which are now understood in\r\nan active or transitive sense only, in their ancient passive or\r\nintransitive sense of lovesome, desirable, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: _Compagne_, _i.e._ she-companions. Filomena is\r\naddressing the female part of the company.]\r\n\r\nSaladin,--whose valour was such that not only from a man of little\r\naccount it made him Soldan of Babylon, but gained him many victories\r\nover kings Saracen and Christian,--having in divers wars and in the\r\nexercise of his extraordinary munificences expended his whole treasure\r\nand having an urgent occasion for a good sum of money nor seeing\r\nwhence he might avail to have it as promptly as it behoved him, called\r\nto mind a rich Jew, by name Melchizedek, who lent at usance in\r\nAlexandria, and bethought himself that this latter had the wherewithal\r\nto oblige him, and he would; but he was so miserly that he would never\r\nhave done it of his freewill and Saladin was loath to use force with\r\nhim; wherefore, need constraining him, he set his every wit awork to\r\nfind a means how the Jew might be brought to serve him in this and\r\npresently concluded to do him a violence coloured by some show of\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he sent for Melchizedek and receiving him familiarly,\r\nseated him by himself, then said to him, 'Honest man, I have\r\nunderstood from divers persons that thou art a very learned man and\r\ndeeply versed in matters of divinity; wherefore I would fain know of\r\nthee whether of the three Laws thou reputest the true, the Jewish, the\r\nSaracen or the Christian.' The Jew, who was in truth a man of learning\r\nand understanding, perceived but too well that Saladin looked to\r\nentrap him in words, so he might fasten a quarrel on him, and\r\nbethought himself that he could not praise any of the three more than\r\nthe others without giving him the occasion he sought. Accordingly,\r\nsharpening his wits, as became one who felt himself in need of an\r\nanswer by which he might not be taken at a vantage, there speedily\r\noccurred to him that which it behoved him reply and he said, 'My lord,\r\nthe question that you propound to me is a nice one and to acquaint you\r\nwith that which I think of the matter, it behoveth me tell you a\r\nlittle story, which you shall hear.\r\n\r\nAn I mistake not, I mind me to have many a time heard tell that there\r\nwas once a great man and a rich, who among other very precious jewels\r\nin his treasury, had a very goodly and costly ring, whereunto being\r\nminded, for its worth and beauty, to do honour and wishing to leave it\r\nin perpetuity to his descendants, he declared that whichsoever of his\r\nsons should, at his death, be found in possession thereof, by his\r\nbequest unto him, should be recognized as his heir and be held of all\r\nthe others in honour and reverence as chief and head. He to whom the\r\nring was left by him held a like course with his own descendants and\r\ndid even as his father had done. In brief the ring passed from hand to\r\nhand, through many generations, and came at last into the possession\r\nof a man who had three goodly and virtuous sons, all very obedient to\r\ntheir father wherefore he loved them all three alike. The young men,\r\nknowing the usance of the ring, each for himself, desiring to be the\r\nmost honoured among his folk, as best he might, besought his father,\r\nwho was now an old man, to leave him the ring, whenas he came to die.\r\nThe worthy man, who loved them all alike and knew not himself how to\r\nchoose to which he had liefer leave the ring, bethought himself,\r\nhaving promised it to each, to seek to satisfy all three and privily\r\nlet make by a good craftsman other two rings, which were so like unto\r\nthe first that he himself scarce knew which was the true. When he came\r\nto die, he secretly gave each one of his sons his ring, wherefore each\r\nof them, seeking after their father's death, to occupy the inheritance\r\nand the honour and denying it to the others, produced his ring, in\r\nwitness of his right, and the three rings being found so like unto one\r\nanother that the true might not be known, the question which was the\r\nfather's very heir abode pending and yet pendeth. And so say I to you,\r\nmy lord, of the three Laws to the three peoples given of God the\r\nFather, whereof you question me; each people deemeth itself to have\r\nhis inheritance, His true Law and His commandments; but of which in\r\nvery deed hath them, even as of the rings, the question yet pendeth.'\r\n\r\nSaladin perceived that the Jew had excellently well contrived to\r\nescape the snare which he had spread before his feet; wherefore he\r\nconcluded to discover to him his need and see if he were willing to\r\nserve him; and so accordingly he did, confessing to him that which he\r\nhad it in mind to do, had he not answered him on such discreet wise.\r\nThe Jew freely furnished him with all that he required, and the Soldan\r\nafter satisfied him in full; moreover, he gave him very great gifts\r\nand still had him to friend and maintained him about his own person in\r\nhigh and honourable estate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the First]\r\n\r\n     A MONK, HAVING FALLEN INTO A SIN DESERVING OF VERY GRIEVOUS\r\n     PUNISHMENT, ADROITLY REPROACHING THE SAME FAULT TO HIS\r\n     ABBOT, QUITTETH HIMSELF OF THE PENALTY\r\n\r\n\r\nFilomena, having despatched her story, was now silent, whereupon\r\nDioneo, who sat next her, knowing already, by the ordinance begun,\r\nthat it fell to his turn to tell, proceeded, without awaiting farther\r\ncommandment from the queen, to speak on this wise: \"Lovesome ladies,\r\nif I have rightly apprehended the intention of you all, we are here to\r\ndivert ourselves with story-telling; wherefore, so but it be not done\r\ncontrary to this our purpose, I hold it lawful unto each (even as our\r\nqueen told us a while agone) to tell such story as he deemeth may\r\nafford most entertainment. Accordingly having heard how, by the good\r\ncounsels of Jehannot de Chevigné, Abraham had his soul saved and how\r\nMelchizedek, by his good sense, defended his riches from Saladin's\r\nambushes, I purpose, without looking for reprehension from you,\r\nbriefly to relate with what address a monk delivered his body from a\r\nvery grievous punishment.\r\n\r\nThere was in Lunigiana, a country not very far hence, a monastery\r\nwhilere more abounding in sanctity and monks than it is nowadays, and\r\ntherein, among others, was a young monk, whose vigour and lustiness\r\nneither fasts nor vigils availed to mortify. It chanced one day,\r\ntowards noontide, when all the other monks slept, that, as he went all\r\nalone round about the convent,[48] which stood in a very solitary\r\nplace, he espied a very well-favoured lass, belike some husbandman's\r\ndaughter of the country, who went about the fields culling certain\r\nherbs, and no sooner had he set eyes on her than he was violently\r\nassailed by carnal appetite. Wherefore, accosting her, he entered into\r\nparley with her and so led on from one thing to another that he came\r\nto an accord with her and brought her to his cell, unperceived of\r\nany; but whilst, carried away by overmuch ardour, he disported himself\r\nwith her less cautiously than was prudent, it chanced that the abbot\r\narose from sleep and softly passing by the monk's cell, heard the\r\nracket that the twain made together; whereupon he came stealthily up\r\nto the door to listen, that he might the better recognize the voices,\r\nand manifestly perceiving that there was a woman in the cell, was at\r\nfirst minded to cause open to him, but after bethought himself to hold\r\nanother course in the matter and, returning to his chamber, awaited\r\nthe monk's coming forth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: Lit. his church (_sua chiesa_); but the context seems to\r\nindicate that the monastery itself is meant.]\r\n\r\nThe latter, all taken up as he was with the wench and his exceeding\r\npleasure and delight in her company, was none the less on his guard\r\nand himseeming he heard some scuffling of feet in the dormitory, he\r\nset his eye to a crevice and plainly saw the abbot stand hearkening\r\nunto him; whereby he understood but too well that the latter must have\r\ngotten wind of the wench's presence in his cell and knowing that sore\r\npunishment would ensue to him thereof, he was beyond measure\r\nchagrined. However, without discovering aught of his concern to the\r\ngirl, he hastily revolved many things in himself, seeking to find some\r\nmeans of escape, and presently hit upon a rare device, which went\r\nstraight to the mark he aimed at. Accordingly, making a show of\r\nthinking he had abidden long enough with the damsel, he said to her,\r\n'I must go cast about for a means how thou mayest win forth hence,\r\nwithout being seen; wherefore do thou abide quietly until my return.'\r\n\r\nThen, going forth and locking the cell door on her, he betook himself\r\nstraight to the abbot's chamber and presenting him with the key,\r\naccording as each monk did, whenas he went abroad, said to him, with a\r\ngood countenance, 'Sir, I was unable to make an end this morning of\r\nbringing off all the faggots I had cut; wherefore with your leave I\r\nwill presently go to the wood and fetch them away.' The abbot, deeming\r\nthe monk unaware that he had been seen of him, was glad of such an\r\nopportunity to inform himself more fully of the offence committed by\r\nhim and accordingly took the key and gave him the leave he sought.\r\nThen, as soon as he saw him gone, he fell to considering which he\r\nshould rather do, whether open his cell in the presence of all the\r\nother monks and cause them to see his default, so they might after\r\nhave no occasion to murmur against himself, whenas he should punish\r\nthe offender, or seek first to learn from the girl herself how the\r\nthing had passed; and bethinking himself that she might perchance be\r\nthe wife or daughter of such a man that he would be loath to have done\r\nher the shame of showing her to all the monks, he determined first to\r\nsee her and after come to a conclusion; wherefore, betaking himself to\r\nthe cell, he opened it and, entering, shut the door after him.\r\n\r\nThe girl, seeing the abbot enter, was all aghast and fell a-weeping\r\nfor fear of shame; but my lord abbot, casting his eyes upon her and\r\nseeing her young and handsome, old as he was, suddenly felt the pricks\r\nof the flesh no less importunate than his young monk had done and fell\r\na-saying in himself, 'Marry, why should I not take somewhat of\r\npleasure, whenas I may, more by token that displeasance and annoy are\r\nstill at hand, whenever I have a mind to them? This is a handsome\r\nwench and is here unknown of any in the world. If I can bring her to\r\ndo my pleasure, I know not why I should not do it. Who will know it?\r\nNo one will ever know it and a sin that's hidden is half forgiven.\r\nMaybe this chance will never occur again. I hold it great sense to\r\navail ourselves of a good, whenas God the Lord sendeth us thereof.'\r\n\r\nSo saying and having altogether changed purpose from that wherewith he\r\ncame, he drew near to the girl and began gently to comfort her,\r\npraying her not to weep, and passing from one word to another, he\r\nended by discovering to her his desire. The girl, who was neither iron\r\nnor adamant, readily enough lent herself to the pleasure of the abbot,\r\nwho, after he had clipped and kissed her again and again, mounted upon\r\nthe monk's pallet and having belike regard to the grave burden of his\r\ndignity and the girl's tender age and fearful of irking her for\r\novermuch heaviness, bestrode not her breast, but set her upon his own\r\nand so a great while disported himself with her.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the monk, who had only made believe to go to the wood and\r\nhad hidden himself in the dormitory, was altogether reassured, whenas\r\nhe saw the abbot enter his cell alone, doubting not but his device\r\nshould have effect, and when he saw him lock the door from within, he\r\nheld it for certain. Accordingly, coming forth of his hiding-place, he\r\nstealthily betook himself to a crevice, through which he both heard\r\nand saw all that the abbot did and said. When it seemed to the latter\r\nthat he had tarried long enough with the damsel, he locked her in the\r\ncell and returned to his own chamber, whence, after awhile, he heard\r\nthe monk stirring and deeming him returned from the wood, thought to\r\nrebuke him severely and cast him into prison, so himself might alone\r\npossess the prey he had gotten; wherefore, sending for him, he very\r\ngrievously rebuked him and with a stern countenance and commanded that\r\nhe should be put in prison.\r\n\r\nThe monk very readily answered, 'Sir, I have not yet pertained long\r\nenough to the order of St. Benedict to have been able to learn every\r\nparticular thereof, and you had not yet shown me that monks should\r\nmake of women a means of mortification,[49] as of fasts and vigils;\r\nbut, now that you have shown it me, I promise you, so you will pardon\r\nme this default, never again to offend therein, but still to do as I\r\nhave seen you do.' The abbot, who was a quick-witted man, readily\r\nunderstood that the monk not only knew more than himself, but had seen\r\nwhat he did; wherefore, his conscience pricking him for his own\r\ndefault, he was ashamed to inflict on the monk a punishment which he\r\nhimself had merited even as he. Accordingly, pardoning him and\r\ncharging him keep silence of that which he had seen, they privily put\r\nthe girl out of doors and it is believed that they caused her return\r\nthither more than once thereafterward.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: Lit. a pressure or oppression (_priemere_, hod.\r\n_premere_, to press or oppress, indicative used as a noun). The monk\r\nof course refers to the posture in which he had seen the abbot have to\r\ndo with the girl, pretending to believe that he placed her on his own\r\nbreast (instead of mounting on hers) out of a sentiment of humility\r\nand a desire to mortify his flesh _ipsâ in voluptate_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the First]\r\n\r\n     THE MARCHIONESS OF MONFERRATO, WITH A DINNER OF HENS AND\r\n     CERTAIN SPRIGHTLY WORDS, CURBETH THE EXTRAVAGANT PASSION OF\r\n     THE KING OF FRANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story told by Dioneo at first pricked the hearts of the listening\r\nladies with somewhat of shamefastness, whereof a modest redness\r\nappearing in their faces gave token; but after, looking one at other\r\nand being scarce able to keep their countenance, they listened,\r\nlaughing in their sleeves. The end thereof being come, after they had\r\ngently chidden him, giving him to understand that such tales were not\r\nfit to be told among ladies, the queen, turning to Fiammetta, who sat\r\nnext him on the grass, bade her follow on the ordinance. Accordingly,\r\nshe began with a good grace and a cheerful countenance, \"It hath\r\noccurred to my mind, fair my ladies,--at once because it pleaseth me\r\nthat we have entered upon showing by stories how great is the efficacy\r\nof prompt and goodly answers and because, like as in men it is great\r\ngood sense to seek still to love a lady of higher lineage than\r\nthemselves,[50] so in women it is great discretion to know how to keep\r\nthemselves from being taken with the love of men of greater condition\r\nthan they,--to set forth to you, in the story which it falleth to me\r\nto tell, how both with deeds and words a noble lady guarded herself\r\nagainst this and diverted another therefrom.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: An evident allusion to Boccaccio's passion for the\r\nPrincess Maria, _i.e._ Fiammetta herself.]\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Monferrato, a man of high worth and gonfalonier[51] of\r\nthe church, had passed beyond seas on the occasion of a general\r\ncrusade undertaken by the Christians, arms in hand, and it being one\r\nday discoursed of his merit at the court of King Phillippe le\r\nBorgne,[52] who was then making ready to depart France upon the same\r\ncrusade, it was avouched by a gentleman present that there was not\r\nunder the stars a couple to match with the marquis and his lady, for\r\nthat, even as he was renowned among knights for every virtue, so was\r\nshe the fairest and noblest of all the ladies in the world. These\r\nwords took such hold upon the mind of the King of France that, without\r\nhaving seen the marchioness, he fell of a sudden ardently in love with\r\nher and determined to take ship for the crusade, on which he was to\r\ngo, no otherwhere than at Genoa, in order that, journeying thither by\r\nland, he might have an honourable occasion of visiting the\r\nmarchioness, doubting not but that, the marquis being absent, he might\r\navail to give effect to his desire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: Or standard-bearer.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: _i.e._ the One-eyed (syn. le myope, the short-sighted,\r\nthe Italian word [_Il Bornio_] having both meanings), _i.e._ Philip\r\nII. of France, better known as Philip Augustus.]\r\n\r\nAs he had bethought himself, so he put his thought into execution;\r\nfor, having sent forward all his power, he set out, attended only by\r\nsome few gentlemen, and coming within a day's journey of the\r\nmarquis's domains, despatched a vauntcourier to bid the lady expect\r\nhim the following morning to dinner. The marchioness, who was well\r\nadvised and discreet, replied blithely that in this he did her the\r\ngreatest of favours and that he would be welcome and after bethought\r\nherself what this might mean that such a king should come to visit her\r\nin her husband's absence, nor was she deceived in the conclusion to\r\nwhich she came, to wit, that the report of her beauty drew him\r\nthither. Nevertheless, like a brave lady as she was, she determined to\r\nreceive him with honour and summoning to her counsels sundry gentlemen\r\nof those who remained there, with their help, she let provide for\r\neverything needful. The ordinance of the repast and of the viands she\r\nreserved to herself alone and having forthright caused collect as many\r\nhens as were in the country, she bade her cooks dress various dishes\r\nof these alone for the royal table.\r\n\r\nThe king came at the appointed time and was received by the lady with\r\ngreat honour and rejoicing. When he beheld her, she seemed to him fair\r\nand noble and well-bred beyond that which he had conceived from the\r\ncourtier's words, whereat he marvelled exceedingly and commended her\r\namain, waxing so much the hotter in his desire as he found the lady\r\noverpassing his foregone conceit of her. After he had taken somewhat\r\nof rest in chambers adorned to the utmost with all that pertaineth to\r\nthe entertainment of such a king, the dinner hour being come, the king\r\nand the marchioness seated themselves at one table, whilst the rest,\r\naccording to their quality, were honourably entertained at others. The\r\nking, being served with many dishes in succession, as well as with\r\nwines of the best and costliest, and to boot gazing with delight the\r\nwhile upon the lovely marchioness, was mightily pleased with his\r\nentertainment; but, after awhile, as the viands followed one upon\r\nanother, he began somewhat to marvel, perceiving that, for all the\r\ndiversity of the dishes, they were nevertheless of nought other than\r\nhens, and this although he knew the part where he was to be such as\r\nshould abound in game of various kinds and although he had, by\r\nadvising the lady in advance of his coming, given her time to send\r\na-hunting. However, much as he might marvel at this, he chose not to\r\ntake occasion of engaging her in parley thereof, otherwise than in the\r\nmatter of her hens, and accordingly, turning to her with a merry air,\r\n'Madam,' quoth he, 'are hens only born in these parts, without ever a\r\ncock?' The marchioness, who understood the king's question excellent\r\nwell, herseeming God had vouchsafed her, according to her wish, an\r\nopportune occasion of discovering her mind, turned to him and answered\r\nboldly, 'Nay, my lord; but women, albeit in apparel and dignities they\r\nmay differ somewhat from others, are natheless all of the same fashion\r\nhere as elsewhere.'\r\n\r\nThe King, hearing this, right well apprehended the meaning of the\r\nbanquet of hens and the virtue hidden in her speech and perceived that\r\nwords would be wasted upon such a lady and that violence was out of\r\nthe question; wherefore, even as he had ill-advisedly taken fire for\r\nher, so now it behoved him sagely, for his own honour's sake, stifle\r\nhis ill-conceived passion. Accordingly, without making any more words\r\nwith her, for fear of her replies, he dined, out of all hope; and the\r\nmeal ended, thanking her for the honourable entertainment he had\r\nreceived from her and commending her to God, he set out for Genoa, so\r\nby his prompt departure he might make amends for his unseemly visit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the First]\r\n\r\n     AN HONEST MAN, WITH A CHANCE PLEASANTRY, PUTTETH TO SHAME\r\n     THE PERVERSE HYPOCRISY OF THE RELIGIOUS ORDERS\r\n\r\n\r\nEmilia, who sat next after Fiammetta,--the courage of the marchioness\r\nand the quaint rebuke administered by her to the King of France having\r\nbeen commended of all the ladies,--began, by the queen's pleasure,\r\nboldly to speak as follows: \"I also, I will not keep silence of a\r\nbiting reproof given by an honest layman to a covetous monk with a\r\nspeech no less laughable than commendable.\r\n\r\nThere was, then, dear lasses, no great while agone, in our city, a\r\nMinor friar and inquisitor of heretical pravity, who, for all he\r\nstudied hard to appear a devout and tender lover of the Christian\r\nreligion, as do they all, was no less diligent in enquiring of who had\r\na well-filled purse than of whom he might find wanting in the things\r\nof the Faith. Thanks to this his diligence, he lit by chance upon a\r\ngood simple man, richer, by far in coin than in wit, who, of no lack\r\nof religion, but speaking thoughtlessly and belike overheated with\r\nwine or excess of mirth, chanced one day to say to a company of his\r\nfriends that he had a wine so good that Christ himself might drink\r\nthereof. This being reported to the inquisitor and he understanding\r\nthat the man's means were large and his purse well filled, ran in a\r\nviolent hurry _cum gladiis et fustibus_[53] to clap up a right\r\ngrievous suit against him, looking not for an amendment of misbelief\r\nin the defendant, but for the filling of his own hand with florins to\r\nensue thereof (as indeed it did,) and causing him to be cited, asked\r\nhim if that which had been alleged against him were true.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: _i.e._ with sword and whips, a technical term of\r\necclesiastical procedure, about equivalent to our \"with the strong arm\r\nof the law.\"]\r\n\r\nThe good man replied that it was and told him how it chanced;\r\nwhereupon quoth the most holy inquisitor, who was a devotee of St.\r\nJohn Goldenbeard,[54] 'Then hast thou made Christ a wine-bibber and\r\ncurious in wines of choice, as if he were Cinciglione[55] or what not\r\nother of your drunken sots and tavern-haunters; and now thou speakest\r\nlowly and wouldst feign this to be a very light matter! It is not as\r\nthou deemest; thou hast merited the fire therefor, an we were minded\r\nto deal with thee as we ought.' With these and many other words he\r\nbespoke him, with as menacing a countenance as if the poor wretch had\r\nbeen Epicurus denying the immortality of the soul, and in brief so\r\nterrified him that the good simple soul, by means of certain\r\nintermediaries, let grease his palm with a good dose of St. John\r\nGoldenmouth's ointment[56] (the which is a sovereign remedy for the\r\npestilential covetise of the clergy and especially of the Minor\r\nBrethren, who dare not touch money), so he should deal mercifully with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: _i.e._ a lover of money.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: A notorious drinker of the time.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: _i.e._ money.]\r\n\r\nThis unguent, being of great virtue (albeit Galen speaketh not thereof\r\nin any part of his Medicines), wrought to such purpose that the fire\r\ndenounced against him was by favour commuted into [the wearing, by way\r\nof penance, of] a cross, and to make the finer banner, as he were to\r\ngo a crusading beyond seas, the inquisitor imposed it him yellow upon\r\nblack. Moreover, whenas he had gotten the money, he detained him about\r\nhimself some days, enjoining him, by way of penance, hear a mass every\r\nmorning at Santa Croce and present himself before him at dinner-time,\r\nand after that he might do what most pleased him the rest of the day;\r\nall which he diligently performed.\r\n\r\nOne morning, amongst others, it chanced that at the Mass he heard a\r\nGospel, wherein these words were chanted, 'For every one ye shall\r\nreceive an hundred and shall possess eternal life.'[57] This he laid\r\nfast up in his memory and according to the commandment given him,\r\npresented him at the eating hour before the inquisitor, whom he found\r\nat dinner. The friar asked him if he had heard mass that morning,\r\nwhereto he promptly answered, 'Ay have I, sir.' Quoth the inquisitor,\r\n'Heardest thou aught therein whereof thou doubtest or would question?'\r\n'Certes,' replied the good man, 'I doubt not of aught that I heard,\r\nbut do firmly believe all to be true. I did indeed hear something\r\nwhich caused and yet causeth me have the greatest compassion of you\r\nand your brother friars, bethinking me of the ill case wherein you\r\nwill find yourselves over yonder in the next life.' 'And what was it\r\nthat moved thee to such compassion of us?' asked the inquisitor.\r\n'Sir,' answered the other, 'it was that verse of the Evangel, which\r\nsaith, \"For every one ye shall receive an hundred.\" 'That is true,'\r\nrejoined the inquisitor; 'but why did these words move thee thus?'\r\n'Sir,' replied the good man, 'I will tell you. Since I have been used\r\nto resort hither, I have seen give out every day to a multitude of\r\npoor folk now one and now two vast great cauldrons of broth, which had\r\nbeen taken away from before yourself and the other brethren of this\r\nconvent, as superfluous; wherefore, if for each one of these cauldrons\r\nof broth there be rendered you an hundred in the world to come, you\r\nwill have so much thereof that you will assuredly all be drowned\r\ntherein.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: \"And every one that hath forsaken houses or brethren or\r\nsisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my name's\r\nsake shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting\r\nlife.\"--Matthew xix. 29. Boccaccio has garbled the passage for the\r\nsake of his point.]\r\n\r\nAll who were at the inquisitor's table fell a-laughing; but the\r\nlatter, feeling the hit at the broth-swilling[58] hypocrisy of himself\r\nand his brethren, was mightily incensed, and but that he had gotten\r\nblame for that which he had already done, he would have saddled him\r\nwith another prosecution, for that with a laughable speech he had\r\nrebuked him and his brother good-for-noughts; wherefore, of his\r\ndespite, he bade him thenceforward do what most pleased him and not\r\ncome before him again.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: Syn. gluttonous (_brodajuola_).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the First]\r\n\r\n     BERGAMINO, WITH A STORY OF PRIMASSO AND THE ABBOT OF CLUNY,\r\n     COURTEOUSLY REBUKETH A FIT OF PARSIMONY NEWLY COME TO MESSER\r\n     CANE DELLA SCALA\r\n\r\n\r\nEmilia's pleasantness and her story moved the queen and all the rest\r\nto laugh and applaud the rare conceit of this new-fangled crusader.\r\nThen, after the laughter had subsided and all were silent again,\r\nFilostrato, whose turn it was to tell, began to speak on this wise:\r\n\"It is a fine thing, noble ladies, to hit a mark that never stirreth;\r\nbut it is well-nigh miraculous if, when some unwonted thing appeareth\r\nof a sudden, it be forthright stricken of an archer. The lewd and\r\nfilthy life of the clergy, in many things as it were a constant mark\r\nfor malice, giveth without much difficulty occasion to all who have a\r\nmind to speak of, to gird at and rebuke it; wherefore, albeit the\r\nworthy man, who pierced the inquisitor to the quick touching the\r\nhypocritical charity of the friars, who give to the poor that which it\r\nshould behove them cast to the swine or throw away, did well, I hold\r\nhim much more to be commended of whom, the foregoing tale moving me\r\nthereto, I am to speak and who with a quaint story rebuked Messer Cane\r\ndella Scala, a magnificent nobleman, of a sudden and unaccustomed\r\nniggardliness newly appeared in him, figuring, in the person of\r\nanother, that which he purposed to say to him concerning themselves;\r\nthe which was on this wise.\r\n\r\nAs very manifest renown proclaimeth well nigh throughout the whole\r\nworld, Messer Cane della Scala, to whom in many things fortune was\r\nfavourable, was one of the most notable and most magnificent gentlemen\r\nthat have been known in Italy since the days of the Emperor Frederick\r\nthe Second. Being minded to make a notable and wonder-goodly\r\nentertainment in Verona, whereunto many folk should have come from\r\ndivers parts and especially men of art[59] of all kinds, he of a\r\nsudden (whatever might have been the cause) withdrew therefrom and\r\nhaving in a measure requited those who were come thither, dismissed\r\nthem all, save only one, Bergamino by name, a man ready of speech and\r\naccomplished beyond the credence of whoso had not heard him, who,\r\nhaving received neither largesse nor dismissal, abode behind, in the\r\nhope that his stay might prove to his future advantage. But Messer\r\nCane had taken it into his mind that what thing soever he might give\r\nhim were far worse bestowed than if it had been thrown into the fire,\r\nnor of this did he bespeak him or let tell him aught.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: _i.e._ gleemen, minstrels, story-tellers, jugglers and\r\nthe like, lit. men of court (_uomini di corte_).]\r\n\r\nBergamino, after some days, finding himself neither called upon nor\r\nrequired unto aught that pertained to his craft and wasting his\r\nsubstance, to boot, in the hostelry with his horses and his servants,\r\nbegan to be sore concerned, but waited yet, himseeming he would not do\r\nwell to depart. Now he had brought with him three goodly and rich\r\nsuits of apparel, which had been given him of other noblemen, that he\r\nmight make a brave appearance at the festival, and his host pressing\r\nfor payment, he gave one thereof to him. After this, tarrying yet\r\nlonger, it behoved him give the host the second suit, an he would\r\nabide longer with him, and withal he began to live upon the third,\r\nresolved to abide in expectation so long as this should last and then\r\ndepart. Whilst he thus fed upon the third suit, he chanced one day,\r\nMesser Cane being at dinner, to present himself before him with a\r\nrueful countenance, and Messer Cane, seeing this, more by way of\r\nrallying him than of intent to divert himself with any of his speech,\r\nsaid to him, 'What aileth thee, Bergamino, to stand thus disconsolate?\r\nTell us somewhat.'[60] Whereupon Bergamino, without a moment's\r\nhesitation, forthright, as if he had long considered it, related the\r\nfollowing story to the purpose of his own affairs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: _Dinne alcuna cosa._ If we take the affix _ne_ (thereof,\r\nof it), in its other meaning (as dative of _noi_, we), of \"to us,\"\r\nthis phrase will read \"Tell somewhat thereof,\" _i.e._ of the cause of\r\nthy melancholy.]\r\n\r\n'My lord,' said he, 'you must know that Primasso was a very learned\r\ngrammarian[61] and a skilful and ready verse-maker above all others,\r\nwhich things rendered him so notable and so famous that, albeit he\r\nmight not everywhere be known by sight, there was well nigh none who\r\nknew him not by name and by report. It chanced that, finding himself\r\nonce at Paris in poor case, as indeed he abode most times, for that\r\nworth is[62] little prized of those who can most,[63] he heard speak\r\nof the Abbot of Cluny, who is believed to be, barring the Pope, the\r\nrichest prelate of his revenues that the Church of God possesseth, and\r\nof him he heard tell marvellous and magnificent things, in that he\r\nstill held open house nor were meat and drink ever denied to any who\r\nwent whereas he might be, so but he sought it what time the Abbot was\r\nat meat. Primasso, hearing this and being one who delighted in looking\r\nupon men of worth and nobility, determined to go see the magnificence\r\nof this Abbot and enquired how near he then abode to Paris. It was\r\nanswered him that he was then at a place of his maybe half a dozen\r\nmiles thence; wherefore Primasso thought to be there at dinner-time,\r\nby starting in the morning betimes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: _i.e._ Latinist.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: Lit. was (_era_); but as Boccaccio puts \"can\"\r\n(_possono_) in the present tense we must either read _è_ and _possono_\r\nor _era_ and _potevano_. The first reading seems the more probable.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: _i.e._ have most power or means of requiting it.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, he enquired the way, but, finding none bound thither, he\r\nfeared lest he might go astray by mischance and happen on a part where\r\nthere might be no victual so readily to be found; wherefore, in order\r\nthat, if this should betide, he might not suffer for lack of food, he\r\nbethought himself to carry with him three cakes of bread, judging that\r\nwater (albeit it was little to his taste) he should find everywhere.\r\nThe bread he put in his bosom and setting out, was fortunate enough to\r\nreach the Abbot's residence before the eating-hour. He entered and\r\nwent spying all about and seeing the great multitude of tables set and\r\nthe mighty preparations making in the kitchen and what not else\r\nprovided against dinner, said in himself, \"Of a truth this Abbot is as\r\nmagnificent as folk say.\" After he had abidden awhile intent upon\r\nthese things, the Abbot's seneschal, eating-time being come, bade\r\nbring water for the hands; which being done, he seated each man at\r\ntable, and it chanced that Primasso was set right over against the\r\ndoor of the chamber, whence the Abbot should come forth into the\r\neating-hall.\r\n\r\nNow it was the usance in that house that neither wine nor bread nor\r\naught else of meat or drink should ever be set on the tables, except\r\nthe Abbot were first came to sit at his own table. Accordingly, the\r\nseneschal, having set the tables, let tell the Abbot that, whenas it\r\npleased him, the meat was ready. The Abbot let open the chamber-door,\r\nthat he might pass into the saloon, and looking before him as he came,\r\nas chance would have it, the first who met his eyes was Primasso, who\r\nwas very ill accoutred and whom he knew not by sight. When he saw him,\r\nincontinent there came into his mind an ill thought and one that had\r\nnever yet been there, and he said in himself, \"See to whom I give my\r\nsubstance to eat!\" Then, turning back, he bade shut the chamber-door\r\nand enquired of those who were about him if any knew yonder losel who\r\nsat at table over against his chamber-door; but all answered no.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Primasso, who had a mind to eat, having come a journey and\r\nbeing unused to fast, waited awhile and seeing that the Abbot came\r\nnot, pulled out of his bosom one of the three cakes of bread he had\r\nbrought with him and fell to eating. The Abbot, after he had waited\r\nawhile, bade one of his serving-men look if Primasso were gone, and\r\nthe man answered, \"No, my lord; nay, he eateth bread, which it seemeth\r\nhe hath brought with him.\" Quoth the Abbot, \"Well, let him eat of his\r\nown, an he have thereof; for of ours he shall not eat to-day.\" Now he\r\nwould fain have had Primasso depart of his own motion, himseeming it\r\nwere not well done to turn him away; but the latter, having eaten one\r\ncake of bread and the Abbot coming not, began upon the second; the\r\nwhich was likewise reported to the Abbot, who had caused look if he\r\nwere gone.\r\n\r\nAt last, the Abbot still tarrying, Primasso, having eaten the second\r\ncake, began upon the third, and this again was reported to the Abbot,\r\nwho fell a-pondering in himself and saying, \"Alack, what new maggot is\r\nthis that is come into my head to-day? What avarice! What despite! And\r\nfor whom? This many a year have I given my substance to eat to\r\nwhosoever had a mind thereto, without regarding if he were gentle or\r\nsimple, poor or rich, merchant or huckster, and have seen it with mine\r\nown eyes squandered by a multitude of ribald knaves; nor ever yet came\r\nthere to my mind the thought that hath entered into me for yonder man.\r\nOf a surety avarice cannot have assailed me for a man of little\r\naccount; needs must this who seemeth to me a losel be some great\r\nmatter, since my soul hath thus repugned to do him honour.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he desired to know who he was and finding that it was\r\nPrimasso, whom he had long known by report for a man of merit, come\r\nthither to see with his own eyes that which he had heard of his\r\nmagnificence, was ashamed and eager to make him amends, studied in\r\nmany ways to do him honour. Moreover, after eating, he caused clothe\r\nhim sumptuously, as befitted his quality, and giving him money and a\r\npalfrey, left it to his own choice to go or stay; whereupon Primasso,\r\nwell pleased with his entertainment, rendered him the best thanks in\r\nhis power and returned on horseback to Paris, whence he had set out\r\nafoot.\r\n\r\nMesser Cane, who was a gentleman of understanding, right well\r\napprehended Bergamino's meaning, without further exposition, and said\r\nto him, smiling, 'Bergamino, thou hast very aptly set forth to me thy\r\nwrongs and merit and my niggardliness, as well as that which thou\r\nwouldst have of me; and in good sooth, never, save now on thine\r\naccount, have I been assailed of parsimony; but I will drive it away\r\nwith that same stick which thou thyself hast shown me.' Then, letting\r\npay Bergamino's host and clothing himself most sumptuously in a suit\r\nof his own apparel, he gave him money and a palfrey and committed to\r\nhis choice for the nonce to go or stay.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the First]\r\n\r\n     GUGLIELMO BORSIERE WITH SOME QUAINT WORDS REBUKETH THE\r\n     NIGGARDLINESS OF MESSER ERMINO DE' GRIMALDI\r\n\r\n\r\nNext Filostrato sat Lauretta, who, after she had heard Bergamino's\r\naddress commended, perceiving that it behoved her tell somewhat,\r\nbegan, without awaiting any commandment, blithely to speak thus: \"The\r\nforegoing story, dear companions,[64] bringeth me in mind to tell how\r\nan honest minstrel on like wise and not without fruit rebuked the\r\ncovetise of a very rich merchant, the which, albeit in effect it\r\nresembleth the last story, should not therefore be less agreeable to\r\nyou, considering that good came thereof in the end.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: Fem.]\r\n\r\nThere was, then, in Genoa, a good while agone, a gentleman called\r\nMesser Ermino de' Grimaldi, who (according to general belief) far\r\noverpassed in wealth of lands and monies the riches of whatsoever\r\nother richest citizen was then known in Italy; and like as he excelled\r\nall other Italians in wealth, even so in avarice and sordidness he\r\noutwent beyond compare every other miser and curmudgeon in the world;\r\nfor not only did he keep a strait purse in the matter of hospitality,\r\nbut, contrary to the general usance of the Genoese, who are wont to\r\ndress sumptuously, he suffered the greatest privations in things\r\nnecessary to his own person, no less than in meat and in drink, rather\r\nthan be at any expense; by reason whereof the surname de' Grimaldi had\r\nfallen away from him and he was deservedly called of all only Messer\r\nErmino Avarizia.\r\n\r\nIt chanced that, whilst, by dint of spending not, he multiplied his\r\nwealth, there came to Genoa a worthy minstrel,[65] both well-bred and\r\nwell-spoken, by name Guglielmo Borsiere, a man no whit like those[66]\r\nof the present day, who (to the no small reproach of the corrupt and\r\nblameworthy usances of those[67] who nowadays would fain be called and\r\nreputed gentlefolk and seigniors) are rather to be styled asses,\r\nreared in all the beastliness and depravity of the basest of mankind,\r\nthan [minstrels, bred] in the courts [of kings and princes]. In those\r\ntimes it used to be a minstrel's office and his wont to expend his\r\npains in negotiating treaties of peace, where feuds or despites had\r\nbefallen between noblemen, or transacting marriages, alliances and\r\nfriendships, in solacing the minds of the weary and diverting courts\r\nwith quaint and pleasant sayings, ay, and with sharp reproofs,\r\nfather-like, rebuking the misdeeds of the froward,--and this for\r\nslight enough reward; but nowadays they study to spend their time in\r\nhawking evil reports from one to another, in sowing discord, in\r\nspeaking naughtiness and obscenity and (what is worse) doing them in\r\nall men's presence, in imputing evil doings, lewdnesses and knaveries,\r\ntrue or false, one to other, and in prompting men of condition with\r\ntreacherous allurements to base and shameful actions; and he is most\r\ncherished and honoured and most munificently entertained and rewarded\r\nof the sorry unmannerly noblemen of our time who saith and doth the\r\nmost abominable words and deeds; a sore and shameful reproach to the\r\npresent age and a very manifest proof that the virtues have departed\r\nthis lower world and left us wretched mortals to wallow in the slough\r\nof the vices.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: _Uomo di corte._ This word has been another grievous\r\nstumbling block to the French and English translators of Boccaccio,\r\nwho render it literally \"courtier.\" The reader need hardly be reminded\r\nthat the minstrel of the middle ages was commonly jester, gleeman and\r\nstory-teller all in one and in these several capacities was allowed\r\nthe utmost license of speech. He was generally attached to the court\r\nof some king or sovereign prince, but, in default of some such\r\npermanent appointment, passed his time in visiting the courts and\r\nmansions of princes and men of wealth and liberty, where his talents\r\nwere likely to be appreciated and rewarded; hence the name _uomo di\r\ncorte_, \"man of court\" (not \"courtier,\" which is _cortigiano_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: _i.e._ those minstrels.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: _i.e._ the noblemen their patrons.]\r\n\r\nBut to return to my story, from which a just indignation hath carried\r\nme somewhat farther astray than I purposed,--I say that the aforesaid\r\nGuglielmo was honoured by all the gentlemen of Genoa and gladly seen\r\nof them, and having sojourned some days in the city and hearing many\r\ntales of Messer Ermino's avarice and sordidness, he desired to see\r\nhim. Messer Ermino having already heard how worthy a man was this\r\nGuglielmo Borsiere and having yet, all miser as he was, some tincture\r\nof gentle breeding, received him with very amicable words and blithe\r\naspect and entered with him into many and various discourses. Devising\r\nthus, he carried him, together with other Genoese who were in his\r\ncompany, into a fine new house of his which he had lately built and\r\nafter having shown it all to him, said, 'Pray, Messer Guglielmo, you\r\nwho have seen and heard many things, can you tell me of something that\r\nwas never yet seen, which I may have depictured in the saloon of this\r\nmy house?' Guglielmo, hearing this his preposterous question,\r\nanswered, 'Sir, I doubt me I cannot undertake to tell you of aught\r\nthat was never yet seen, except it were sneezings or the like; but, an\r\nit like you, I will tell you of somewhat which me thinketh you never\r\nyet beheld.' Quoth Messer Ermino, not looking for such an answer as he\r\ngot, 'I pray you tell me what it is.' Whereto Guglielmo promptly\r\nreplied, 'Cause Liberality to be here depictured.'\r\n\r\nWhen Messer Ermino heard this speech, there took him incontinent such\r\na shame that it availed in a manner to change his disposition\r\naltogether to the contrary of that which it had been and he said,\r\n'Messer Guglielmo, I will have it here depictured after such a fashion\r\nthat neither you nor any other shall ever again have cause to tell me\r\nthat I have never seen nor known it.' And from that time forth (such\r\nwas the virtue of Guglielmo's words) he was the most liberal and the\r\nmost courteous gentleman of his day in Genoa and he who most\r\nhospitably entreated both strangers and citizens.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NINTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the First]\r\n\r\n     THE KING OF CYPRUS, TOUCHED TO THE QUICK BY A GASCON LADY,\r\n     FROM A MEAN-SPIRITED PRINCE BECOMETH A MAN OF WORTH AND\r\n     VALIANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Queen's last commandment rested with Elisa, who, without awaiting\r\nit, began all blithely, \"Young ladies, it hath often chanced that what\r\nall manner reproofs and many pains[68] bestowed upon a man have not\r\navailed to bring about in him hath been effected by a word more often\r\nspoken at hazard than of purpose aforethought. This is very well shown\r\nin the story related by Lauretta and I, in my turn, purpose to prove\r\nto you the same thing by means of another and a very short one; for\r\nthat, since good things may still serve, they should be received with\r\na mind attent, whoever be the sayer thereof.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: Syn. penalties, punishments (_pene_).]\r\n\r\nI say, then, that in the days of the first King of Cyprus, after the\r\nconquest of the Holy Land by Godefroi de Bouillon, it chanced that a\r\ngentlewoman of Gascony went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre and\r\nreturning thence, came to Cyprus, where she was shamefully abused of\r\ncertain lewd fellows; whereof having complained, without getting any\r\nsatisfaction, she thought to appeal to the King for redress, but was\r\ntold that she would lose her pains, for that he was of so abject a\r\ncomposition and so little of worth that, far from justifying others of\r\ntheir wrongs, he endured with shameful pusillanimity innumerable\r\naffronts offered to himself, insomuch that whose had any grudge\r\n[against him] was wont to vent his despite by doing him some shame or\r\ninsult.\r\n\r\nThe lady, hearing this and despairing of redress, bethought herself,\r\nby way of some small solacement of her chagrin, to seek to rebuke the\r\nking's pusillanimity; wherefore, presenting herself in tears before\r\nhim, she said to him, 'My lord, I come not into thy presence for any\r\nredress that I expect of the wrong that hath been done me; but in\r\nsatisfaction thereof, I prithee teach me how thou dost to suffer those\r\naffronts which I understand are offered unto thyself, so haply I may\r\nlearn of thee patiently to endure mine own, the which God knoweth, an\r\nI might, I would gladly bestow on thee, since thou art so excellent a\r\nsupporter thereof.'\r\n\r\nThe King, who till then had been sluggish and supine, awoke as if from\r\nsleep and beginning with the wrong done to the lady, which he cruelly\r\navenged, thenceforth became a very rigorous prosecutor of all who\r\ncommitted aught against the honour of his crown.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TENTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the First]\r\n\r\n     MASTER ALBERTO OF BOLOGNA CIVILLY PUTTETH A LADY TO THE\r\n     BLUSH WHO THOUGHT TO HAVE SHAMED HIM OF BEING ENAMOURED OF\r\n     HER\r\n\r\n\r\nElisa being now silent, the last burden of the story-telling rested\r\nwith the queen, who, with womanly grace beginning to speak, said,\r\n\"Noble damsels, like as in the lucid nights the stars are the ornament\r\nof the sky and as in Spring-time the flowers of the green meadows,\r\neven so are commendable manners and pleasing discourse adorned by\r\nwitty sallies, which latter, for that they are brief, are yet more\r\nbeseeming to women than to men, inasmuch as much and long speech,\r\nwhenas it may be dispensed with, is straitlier forbidden unto women\r\nthan to men, albeit nowadays there are few or no women left who\r\nunderstand a sprightly saying or, if they understand it, know how to\r\nanswer it, to the general shame be it said of ourselves and of all\r\nwomen alive. For that virtue,[69] which was erst in the minds of the\r\nwomen of times past, those of our day have diverted to the adornment\r\nof the body, and she on whose back are to be seen the most motley\r\ngarments and the most gaudily laced and garded and garnished with the\r\ngreatest plenty of fringes and purflings and broidery deemeth herself\r\nworthy to be held of far more account than her fellows and to be\r\nhonoured above them, considering not that, were it a question of who\r\nshould load her back and shoulders with bravery, an ass would carry\r\nmuch more thereof than any of them nor would therefore be honoured for\r\nmore than an ass.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: _Virtù_, in the old Roman sense of strength, vigour,\r\nenergy.]\r\n\r\nI blush to avow it, for that I cannot say aught against other women\r\nbut I say it against myself; these women that are so laced and purfled\r\nand painted and parti-coloured abide either mute and senseless, like\r\nmarble statues, or, an they be questioned, answer after such a fashion\r\nthat it were far better to have kept silence. And they would have you\r\nbelieve that their unableness to converse among ladies and men of\r\nparts proceedeth from purity of mind, and to their witlessness they\r\ngive the name of modesty, as if forsooth no woman were modest but she\r\nwho talketh with her chamberwoman or her laundress or her bake-wench;\r\nthe which had Nature willed, as they would have it believed, she had\r\nassuredly limited unto them their prattle on other wise. It is true\r\nthat in this, as in other things, it behoveth to have regard to time\r\nand place and with whom one talketh; for that it chanceth bytimes that\r\nwomen or men, thinking with some pleasantry or other to put another to\r\nthe blush and not having well measured their own powers with those of\r\nthe latter, find that confusion, which they thought to cast upon\r\nanother, recoil upon themselves. Wherefore, so you may know how to\r\nkeep yourselves and that, to boot, you may not serve as a text for the\r\nproverb which is current everywhere, to wit, that women in everything\r\nstill take the worst, I would have you learn a lesson from the last of\r\nto-day's stories, which falleth to me to tell, to the intent that,\r\neven as you are by nobility of mind distinguished from other women, so\r\nlikewise you may show yourselves no less removed from them by\r\nexcellence of manners.\r\n\r\nIt is not many years since there lived (and belike yet liveth) at\r\nBologna a very great and famous physician, known by manifest renown to\r\nwell nigh all the world. His name was Master Alberto and such was the\r\nvivacity of his spirit that, albeit he was an old man of hard upon\r\nseventy years of age and well nigh all natural heat had departed his\r\nbody, he scrupled not to expose himself to the flames of love; for\r\nthat, having seen at an entertainment a very beautiful widow lady,\r\ncalled, as some say, Madam Malgherida[70] de' Ghisolieri, and being\r\nvastly taken with her, he received into his mature bosom, no otherwise\r\nthan if he had been a young gallant, the amorous fire, insomuch that\r\nhimseemed he rested not well by night, except the day foregone he had\r\nlooked upon the delicate and lovesome countenance of the fair lady.\r\nWherefore he fell to passing continually before her house, now afoot\r\nand now on horseback, as the occasion served him, insomuch that she\r\nand many other ladies got wind of the cause of his constant passings\r\nto and fro and oftentimes made merry among themselves to see a man\r\nthus ripe of years and wit in love, as if they deemed that that most\r\npleasant passion of love took root and flourished only in the silly\r\nminds of the young and not otherwhere.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: Old form of Margherita.]\r\n\r\nWhat while he continued to pass back and forth, it chanced one holiday\r\nthat, the lady being seated with many others before her door and\r\nespying Master Alberto making towards them from afar, they one and\r\nall took counsel together to entertain him and do him honour and after\r\nto rally him on that his passion. Accordingly, they all rose to\r\nreceive him and inviting him [to enter,] carried him into a shady\r\ncourtyard, whither they let bring the choicest of wines and sweetmeats\r\nand presently enquired of him, in very civil and pleasant terms, how\r\nit might be that he was fallen enamoured of that fair lady, knowing\r\nher to be loved of many handsome, young and sprightly gentlemen. The\r\nphysician, finding himself thus courteously attacked, put on a blithe\r\ncountenance and answered, 'Madam, that I love should be no marvel to\r\nany understanding person, and especially that I love yourself, for\r\nthat you deserve it; and albeit old men are by operation of nature\r\nbereft of the vigour that behoveth unto amorous exercises, yet not for\r\nall that are they bereft of the will nor of the wit to apprehend that\r\nwhich is worthy to be loved; nay, this latter is naturally the better\r\nvalued of them, inasmuch as they have more knowledge and experience\r\nthan the young. As for the hope that moveth me, who am an old man, to\r\nlove you who are courted of many young gallants, it is on this wise: I\r\nhave been many a time where I have seen ladies lunch and eat lupins\r\nand leeks. Now, although in the leek no part is good, yet is the\r\nhead[71] thereof less hurtful and more agreeable to the taste; but you\r\nladies, moved by a perverse appetite, commonly hold the head in your\r\nhand and munch the leaves, which are not only naught, but of an ill\r\nsavour. How know I, madam, but you do the like in the election of your\r\nlovers? In which case, I should be the one chosen of you and the\r\nothers would be turned away.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: _i.e._ the base or eatable part of the stem.]\r\n\r\nThe gentlewoman and her companions were somewhat abashed and said,\r\n'Doctor, you have right well and courteously chastised our\r\npresumptuous emprise; algates, your love is dear to me, as should be\r\nthat of a man of worth and learning; wherefore, you may in all\r\nassurance command me, as your creature, of your every pleasure, saving\r\nonly mine honour.' The physician, rising with his companions, thanked\r\nthe lady and taking leave of her with laughter and merriment, departed\r\nthence. Thus the lady, looking not whom she rallied and thinking to\r\ndiscomfit another, was herself discomfited; wherefrom, an you be wise,\r\nyou will diligently guard yourselves.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sun had begun to decline towards the evening, and the heat was in\r\ngreat part abated, when the stories of the young ladies and of the\r\nthree young men came to an end; whereupon quoth the queen\r\nblithesomely, \"Henceforth, dear companions, there remaineth nought\r\nmore to do in the matter of my governance for the present day, save to\r\ngive you a new queen, who shall, according to her judgment, order her\r\nlife and ours, for that[72] which is to come, unto honest pleasance.\r\nAnd albeit the day may be held to endure from now until nightfall,\r\nyet,--for that whoso taketh not somewhat of time in advance cannot,\r\nmeseemeth, so well provide for the future and in order that what the\r\nnew queen shall deem needful for the morrow may be prepared,--methinketh\r\nthe ensuing days should commence at this hour. Wherefore, in reverence\r\nof Him unto whom all things live and for our own solacement, Filomena,\r\na right discreet damsel, shall, as queen, govern our kingdom for the\r\ncoming day.\" So saying, she rose to her feet and putting off the\r\nlaurel-wreath, set it reverently on the head of Filomena, whom first\r\nherself and after all the other ladies and the young men likewise\r\nsaluted as queen, cheerfully submitting themselves to her governance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: _i.e._ that day.]\r\n\r\nFilomena blushed somewhat to find herself invested with the queendom,\r\nbut, calling to mind the words a little before spoken by\r\nPampinea,[73]--in order that she might not appear witless, she resumed\r\nher assurance and in the first place confirmed all the offices given\r\nby Pampinea; then, having declared that they should abide whereas they\r\nwere, she appointed that which was to do against the ensuing morning,\r\nas well as for that night's supper, and after proceeded to speak thus:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: See ante, p. 8.]\r\n\r\n\"Dearest companions, albeit Pampinea, more of her courtesy than for\r\nany worth of mine, hath made me queen of you all, I am not therefore\r\ndisposed to follow my judgment alone in the manner of our living, but\r\nyours together with mine; and that you may know that which meseemeth\r\nis to do and consequently at your pleasure add thereto or abate\r\nthereof, I purpose briefly to declare it to you.\r\n\r\nIf I have well noted the course this day held by Pampinea, meseemeth I\r\nhave found it alike praiseworthy and delectable; wherefore till such\r\ntime as, for overlong continuance or other reason, it grow irksome to\r\nus, I judge it not to be changed. Order, then, being taken for [the\r\ncontinuance of] that which we have already begun to do, we will,\r\narising hence, go awhile a-pleasuring, and whenas the sun shall be for\r\ngoing under, we will sup in the cool of the evening, and after sundry\r\ncanzonets and other pastimes, we shall do well to betake ourselves to\r\nsleep. To-morrow, rising in the cool of the morning, we will on like\r\nwise go somewhither a-pleasuring, as shall be most agreeable to every\r\none; and as we have done to-day, we will at the due hour come back to\r\neat; after which we will dance and when we arise from sleep, as to-day\r\nwe have done, we will return hither to our story-telling, wherein\r\nmeseemeth a very great measure to consist alike of pleasance and of\r\nprofit. Moreover, that which Pampinea had indeed no opportunity of\r\ndoing, by reason of her late election to the governance, I purpose now\r\nto enter upon, to wit, to limit within some bound that whereof we are\r\nto tell and to declare it[74] to you beforehand, so each of you may\r\nhave leisure to think of some goodly story to relate upon the theme\r\nproposed, the which, an it please you, shall be on this wise; namely,\r\nseeing that since the beginning of the world men have been and will\r\nbe, until the end thereof, bandied about by various shifts of fortune,\r\neach shall be holden to tell OF THOSE WHO AFTER BEING BAFFLED BY\r\nDIVERS CHANCES HAVE WON AT LAST TO A JOYFUL ISSUE BEYOND THEIR HOPE.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: _i.e._ the terms of the limitation aforesaid.]\r\n\r\nLadies and men alike all commended this ordinance and declared\r\nthemselves ready to ensue it. Only Dioneo, the others all being\r\nsilent, said, \"Madam, as all the rest have said, so say I, to wit that\r\nthe ordinance given by you is exceeding pleasant and commendable; but\r\nof especial favour I crave you a boon, which I would have confirmed to\r\nme for such time as our company shall endure, to wit, that I may not\r\nbe constrained by this your law to tell a story upon the given theme,\r\nan it like me not, but shall be free to tell that which shall most\r\nplease me. And that none may think I seek this favour as one who hath\r\nnot stories, in hand, from this time forth I am content to be still\r\nthe last to tell.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen,--who knew him for a merry man and a gamesome and was well\r\nassured that he asked this but that he might cheer the company with\r\nsome laughable story, whenas they should be weary of discoursing,--with\r\nthe others' consent, cheerfully accorded him the favour he sought.\r\nThen, arising from session, with slow steps they took their way\r\ntowards a rill of very clear water, that ran down from a little hill,\r\namid great rocks and green herbage, into a valley overshaded with many\r\ntrees and there, going about in the water, bare-armed and shoeless,\r\nthey fell to taking various diversions among themselves, till\r\nsupper-time drew near, when they returned to the palace and there\r\nsupped merrily. Supper ended, the queen called for instruments of\r\nmusic and bade Lauretta lead up a dance, whilst Emilia sang a song, to\r\nthe accompaniment of Dioneo's lute. Accordingly, Lauretta promptly set\r\nup a dance and led it off, whilst Emilia amorously warbled the\r\nfollowing song:\r\n\r\n     I burn for mine own charms with such a fire,\r\n         Methinketh that I ne'er\r\n       Of other love shall reck or have desire.\r\n\r\n     Whene'er I mirror me, I see therein[75]\r\n       That good which still contenteth heart and spright;\r\n     Nor fortune new nor thought of old can win\r\n       To dispossess me of such dear delight.\r\n       What other object, then, could fill my sight,\r\n         Enough of pleasance e'er\r\n     To kindle in my breast a new desire?\r\n\r\n     This good flees not, what time soe'er I'm fain\r\n       Afresh to view it for my solacement;\r\n     Nay, at my pleasure, ever and again\r\n       With such a grace it doth itself present\r\n       Speech cannot tell it nor its full intent\r\n         Be known of mortal e'er,\r\n       Except indeed he burn with like desire.\r\n\r\n     And I, grown more enamoured every hour,\r\n       The straitlier fixed mine eyes upon it be,\r\n     Give all myself and yield me to its power,\r\n       E'en tasting now of that it promised me,\r\n       And greater joyance yet I hope to see,\r\n         Of such a strain as ne'er\r\n       Was proven here below of love-desire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: _i.e._ in the mirrored presentment of her own beauty.]\r\n\r\nLauretta having thus made an end of her ballad,[76]--in the burden of\r\nwhich all had blithely joined, albeit the words thereof gave some much\r\nmatter for thought,--divers other rounds were danced and a part of the\r\nshort night being now spent, it pleased the queen to give an end to\r\nthe first day; wherefore, letting kindle the flambeaux, she commanded\r\nthat all should betake themselves to rest until the ensuing morning,\r\nand all, accordingly, returning to their several chambers, did so.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: _Ballatella_, lit. little dancing song or song made to\r\nbe sung as an accompaniment to a dance (from _ballare_, to dance).\r\nThis is the origin of our word ballad.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE ENDETH THE FIRST DAY\r\nOF THE DECAMERON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Day the Second_\r\n\r\n     HERE BEGINNETH THE SECOND DAY OF THE DECAMERON WHEREIN UNDER\r\n     THE GOVERNANCE OF FILOMENA IS DISCOURSED OF THOSE WHO AFTER\r\n     BEING BAFFLED BY DIVERS CHANCES HAVE WON AT LAST TO A JOYFUL\r\n     ISSUE BEYOND THEIR HOPE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun had already everywhere brought on the new day with its light\r\nand the birds, carolling blithely among the green branches, bore\r\nwitness thereof unto the ear with their merry songs, when the ladies\r\nand the three young men, arising all, entered the gardens and pressing\r\nthe dewy grass with slow step, went wandering hither and thither,\r\nweaving goodly garlands and disporting themselves, a great while. And\r\nlike as they had done the day foregone, even so did they at present;\r\nto wit, having eaten in the cool and danced awhile, they betook them\r\nto repose and arising thence after none, came all, by command of their\r\nqueen, into the fresh meadows, where they seated themselves round\r\nabout her. Then she, who was fair of favour and exceeding pleasant of\r\naspect, having sat awhile, crowned with her laurel wreath, and looked\r\nall her company in the face, bade Neifile give beginning to the day's\r\nstories by telling one of her fashion; whereupon the latter, without\r\nmaking any excuse, blithely began to speak thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Second]\r\n\r\n     MARTELLINO FEIGNETH HIMSELF A CRIPPLE AND MAKETH BELIEVE TO\r\n     WAX WHOLE UPON THE BODY OF ST. ARRIGO. HIS IMPOSTURE BEING\r\n     DISCOVERED, HE IS BEATEN AND BEING AFTER TAKEN [FOR A\r\n     THIEF,] GOETH IN PERIL OF BEING HANGED BY THE NECK, BUT\r\n     ULTIMATELY ESCAPETH\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It chanceth oft, dearest ladies, that he who studieth to befool\r\nothers, and especially in things reverend, findeth himself with\r\nnothing for his pains but flouts and whiles cometh not off scathless.\r\nWherefore, that I may obey the queen's commandment and give beginning\r\nto the appointed theme with a story of mine, I purpose to relate to\r\nyou that which, first misfortunately and after happily, beyond his\r\nevery thought, betided a townsman of ours.\r\n\r\nNo great while agone there was at Treviso a German called Arrigo, who,\r\nbeing a poor man, served whoso required him to carry burdens for hire;\r\nand withal he was held of all a man of very holy and good life.\r\nWherefore, be it true or untrue, when he died, it befell, according to\r\nthat which the Trevisans avouch, that, in the hour of his death, the\r\nbells of the great church of Treviso began to ring, without being\r\npulled of any. The people of the city, accounting this a miracle,\r\nproclaimed this Arrigo a saint and running all to the house where he\r\nlay, bore his body, for that of a saint, to the Cathedral, whither\r\nthey fell to bringing the halt, the impotent and the blind and others\r\nafflicted with whatsoever defect or infirmity, as if they should all\r\nbe made whole by the touch of the body.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this great turmoil and concourse of folk, it chanced\r\nthat there arrived at Treviso three of our townsmen, whereof one was\r\ncalled Stecchi, another Martellino and the third Marchese, men who\r\nvisited the courts of princes and lords and diverted the beholders by\r\ntravestying themselves and counterfeiting whatsoever other man with\r\nrare motions and grimaces. Never having been there before and seeing\r\nall the folk run, they marvelled and hearing the cause, were for going\r\nto see what was toward; wherefore they laid up their baggage at an inn\r\nand Marchese said, 'We would fain go look upon this saint; but, for my\r\npart, I see not how we may avail to win thither, for that I understand\r\nthe Cathedral place is full of German and other men-at-arms, whom the\r\nlord of this city hath stationed there, so no riot may betide; more by\r\ntoken that they say the church is so full of folk that well nigh none\r\nelse might enter there.' 'Let not that hinder you,' quoth Martellino,\r\nwho was all agog to see the show; 'I warrant you I will find a means\r\nof winning to the holy body.' 'How so?' asked Marchese, and Martellino\r\nanswered, 'I will tell thee. I will counterfeit myself a cripple and\r\nthou on one side and Stecchi on the other shall go upholding me, as it\r\nwere I could not walk of myself, making as if you would fain bring me\r\nto the saint, so he may heal me. There will be none but, seeing us,\r\nwill make way for us and let us pass.'\r\n\r\nThe device pleased Marchese and Stecchi and they went forth of the inn\r\nwithout delay, all three. Whenas they came to a solitary place,\r\nMartellino writhed his hands and fingers and arms and legs and eke his\r\nmouth and eyes and all his visnomy on such wise that it was a\r\nfrightful thing to look upon, nor was there any saw him but would have\r\navouched him to be verily all fordone and palsied of his person.\r\nMarchese and Stecchi, taking him up, counterfeited as he was, made\r\nstraight for the church, with a show of the utmost compunction, humbly\r\nbeseeching all who came in their way for the love of God to make room\r\nfor them, the which was lightly yielded them. Brief, every one gazing\r\non them and crying well nigh all, 'Make way! Make way!' they came\r\nwhereas Saint Arrigo's body lay and Martellino was forthright taken up\r\nby certain gentlemen who stood around and laid upon the body, so he\r\nmight thereby regain the benefit of health. Martellino, having lain\r\nawhile, whilst all the folk were on the stretch to see what should\r\ncome of him, began, as right well he knew how, to make a show of\r\nopening first one finger, then a hand and after putting forth an arm\r\nand so at last coming to stretch himself out altogether. Which when\r\nthe people saw, they set up such an outcry in praise of Saint Arrigo\r\nas would have drowned the very thunder.\r\n\r\nNow, as chance would have it, there was therenigh a certain\r\nFlorentine, who knew Martellino very well, but had not recognized him,\r\ncounterfeited as he was, whenas he was brought thither. However, when\r\nhe saw him grown straight again, he knew him and straightway fell\r\na-laughing and saying, 'God confound him! Who that saw him come had\r\nnot deemed him palsied in good earnest?' His words were overheard of\r\nsundry Trevisans, who asked him incontinent, 'How! Was he not\r\npalsied?' 'God forbid!' answered the Florentine. 'He hath ever been as\r\nstraight as any one of us; but he knoweth better than any man in the\r\nworld how to play off tricks of this kind and counterfeit what shape\r\nsoever he will.'\r\n\r\nWhen the others heard this, there needed nothing farther; but they\r\npushed forward by main force and fell a-crying out and saying, 'Seize\r\nyonder traitor and scoffer at God and His saints, who, being whole of\r\nhis body, hath come hither, in the guise of a cripple, to make mock of\r\nus and of our saint!' So saying, they laid hold of Martellino and\r\npulled him down from the place where he lay. Then, taking him by the\r\nhair of his head and tearing all the clothes off his back, they fell\r\nupon him with cuffs and kicks; nor himseemed was there a man in the\r\nplace but ran to do likewise. Martellino roared out, 'Mercy, for God's\r\nsake!' and fended himself as best he might, but to no avail; for the\r\ncrowd redoubled upon him momently. Stecchi and Marchese, seeing this,\r\nbegan to say one to the other that things stood ill, but, fearing for\r\nthemselves, dared not come to his aid; nay, they cried out with the\r\nrest to put him to death, bethinking them the while how they might\r\navail to fetch him out of the hands of the people, who would certainly\r\nhave slain him, but for a means promptly taken by Marchese; to wit,\r\nall the officers of the Seignory being without the church, he betook\r\nhimself as quickliest he might, to him who commanded for the Provost\r\nand said, 'Help, for God's sake! There is a lewd fellow within who\r\nhath cut my purse, with a good hundred gold florins. I pray you take\r\nhim, so I may have mine own again.'\r\n\r\nHearing this, a round dozen of sergeants ran straightway whereas the\r\nwretched Martellino was being carded without a comb and having with\r\nthe greatest pains in the world broken through the crowd, dragged him\r\nout of the people's hands, all bruised and tumbled as he was, and\r\nhaled him off to the palace, whither many followed him who held\r\nthemselves affronted of him and hearing that he had been taken for a\r\ncutpurse and themseeming they had no better occasion[77] of doing him\r\nan ill turn,[78] began each on like wise to say that he had cut his\r\npurse. The Provost's judge, who was a crabbed, ill-conditioned fellow,\r\nhearing this, forthright took him apart and began to examine him of\r\nthe matter; but Martellino answered jestingly, as if he made light of\r\nhis arrest; whereat the judge, incensed, caused truss him up and give\r\nhim two or three good bouts of the strappado, with intent to make him\r\nconfess that which they laid to his charge, so he might after have him\r\nstrung up by the neck.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: Or pretext (_titolo_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Or \"having him punished,\" lit. \"causing give him ill\r\nluck\" (_fargli dar la mala ventura_). This passage, like so many\r\nothers of the Decameron, is ambiguous and may also be read\r\n\"themseeming none other had a juster title to do him an ill turn.\"]\r\n\r\nWhen he was let down again, the judge asked him once more if that were\r\ntrue which the folk avouched against him, and Martellino, seeing that\r\nit availed him not to deny, answered, 'My lord, I am ready to confess\r\nthe truth to you; but first make each who accuseth me say when and\r\nwhere I cut his purse, and I will tell you what I did and what not.'\r\nQuoth the judge, 'I will well,' and calling some of his accusers, put\r\nthe question to them; whereupon one said that he had cut his purse\r\neight, another six and a third four days agone, whilst some said that\r\nvery day. Martellino, hearing this, said, 'My lord, these all lie in\r\ntheir throats and I can give you this proof that I tell you the truth,\r\ninasmuch as would God it were as sure that I had never come hither as\r\nit is that I was never in this place till a few hours agone; and as\r\nsoon as I arrived, I went, of my ill fortune, to see yonder holy body\r\nin the church, where I was carded as you may see; and that this I say\r\nis true, the Prince's officer who keepeth the register of strangers\r\ncan certify you, he and his book, as also can my host. If, therefore,\r\nyou find it as I tell you, I beseech you torture me not neither put me\r\nto death at the instance of these wicked, men.'\r\n\r\nWhilst things were at this pass, Marchese and Stecchi, hearing that\r\nthe judge of the Provostry was proceeding rigorously against\r\nMartellino and had already given him the strappado, were sore affeared\r\nand said in themselves, 'We have gone the wrong way to work; we have\r\nbrought him forth of the frying-pan and cast him into the fire.'\r\nWherefore they went with all diligence in quest of their host and\r\nhaving found him, related to him how the case stood. He laughed and\r\ncarried them to one Sandro Agolanti, who abode in Treviso and had\r\ngreat interest with the Prince, and telling him everything in order,\r\njoined with them in beseeching him to occupy himself with Martellino's\r\naffairs. Sandro, after many a laugh, repaired to the Prince and\r\nprevailed upon him to send for Martellino.\r\n\r\nThe Prince's messengers found Martellino still in his shirt before the\r\njudge, all confounded and sore adread, for that the judge would hear\r\nnothing in his excuse; nay, having, by chance, some spite against the\r\npeople of Florence, he was altogether determined to hang him by the\r\nneck and would on no wise render him up to the Prince till such time\r\nas he was constrained thereto in his despite. Martellino, being\r\nbrought before the lord of the city and having told him everything in\r\norder, besought him, by way of special favour, to let him go about his\r\nbusiness, for that, until he should be in Florence again, it would\r\nstill seem to him he had the rope about his neck. The Prince laughed\r\nheartily at his mischance and let give each of the three a suit of\r\napparel, wherewith they returned home safe and sound, having, beyond\r\nall their hope, escaped so great a peril.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Second]\r\n\r\n     RINALDO D'ASTI, HAVING BEEN ROBBED, MAKETH HIS WAY TO CASTEL\r\n     GUGLIELMO, WHERE HE IS HOSPITABLY ENTERTAINED BY A WIDOW\r\n     LADY AND HAVING MADE GOOD HIS LOSS, RETURNETH TO HIS OWN\r\n     HOUSE, SAFE AND SOUND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ladies laughed immoderately at Martellino's misfortunes narrated\r\nby Neifile, as did also the young men and especially Filostrato, whom,\r\nfor that he sat next Neifile, the queen bade follow her in\r\nstory-telling. Accordingly he began without delay, \"Fair ladies, needs\r\nmust I tell you a story[79] of things Catholic,[80] in part mingled\r\nwith misadventures and love-matters, which belike will not be other\r\nthan profitable to hear, especially to those who are wayfarers in the\r\nperilous lands of love, wherein whoso hath not said St. Julian his\r\nPaternoster is oftentimes ill lodged, for all he have a good bed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: Lit. a story striveth in (draweth) me to be told or to\r\ntell itself (_a raccontarsi mi tira una novella_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: _i.e._ religious matters (_cose cattoliche_).]\r\n\r\nIn the days, then, of the Marquis Azzo of Ferrara, there came a\r\nmerchant called Rinaldo d'Asti to Bologna on his occasions, which\r\nhaving despatched and returning homeward, it chanced that, as he\r\nissued forth of Ferrara and rode towards Verona, he fell in with\r\ncertain folk who seemed merchants, but were in truth highwaymen and\r\nmen of lewd life and condition, with whom he unwarily joined company\r\nand entered into discourse. They, seeing him to be a merchant and\r\njudging him to have monies about him, took counsel together to rob\r\nhim, at the first opportunity that should offer; wherefore, that he\r\nmight take no suspicion, they went devising with him, like decent\r\npeaceable folk, of things honest and seemly and of loyalty, ordering\r\nthemselves toward him, in so far as they knew and could, with respect\r\nand complaisance, so that he deemed himself in great luck to have met\r\nwith them, for that he was alone with a serving-man of his on\r\nhorseback.\r\n\r\nThus faring on and passing from one thing to another, as it chanceth\r\nin discourse, they presently fell to talking of the orisons that men\r\noffer up to God, and one of the highwaymen, who were three in number,\r\nsaid to Rinaldo, 'And you, fair sir, what orison do you use to say on\r\na journey?' Whereto he answered, 'Sooth to say, I am but a plain man\r\nand little versed in these matters and have few orisons in hand; I\r\nlive after the old fashion and let a couple of shillings pass for\r\nfour-and-twenty pence.[81] Nevertheless, I have still been wont, when\r\non a journey, to say of a morning, what time I come forth of the inn,\r\na Pater and an Ave for the soul of St. Julian's father and mother,\r\nafter which I pray God and the saint to grant me a good lodging for\r\nthe ensuing night. Many a time in my day have I, in the course of my\r\njourneyings, been in great perils, from all of which I have escaped\r\nand have still found myself at night, to boot, in a place of safety\r\nand well lodged. Wherefore I firmly believe that St. Julian, in whose\r\nhonour I say it, hath gotten me this favour of God; nor meseemeth\r\nshould I fare well by day nor come to good harbourage at night, except\r\nI had said it in the morning.' 'And did you say it[82] this morning?'\r\nasked he who had put the question to him. 'Ay did I,' answered\r\nRinaldo; whereupon quoth the other in himself, knowing well how the\r\nthing was to go, 'May it stand thee in stead![83] For, an no hindrance\r\nbetide us, methinketh thou art e'en like to lodge ill.' Then, to\r\nRinaldo, 'I likewise,' quoth he, 'have travelled much and have never\r\nsaid this orison, albeit I have heard it greatly commended, nor ever\r\nhath it befallen me to lodge other than well; and this evening maybe\r\nyou shall chance to see which will lodge the better, you who have said\r\nit or I who have not. True, I use, instead thereof, the _Dirupisti_ or\r\nthe _Intemerata_ or the _De Profundis_, the which, according to that\r\nwhich a grandmother of mine used to tell me, are of singular virtue.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: _i.e._ take things by the first intention, without\r\nseeking to refine upon them, or, in English popular phrase, \"I do not\r\npretend to see farther through a stone wall than my neighbours.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: _i.e._ the aforesaid orison.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: Or \"'Twill have been opportunely done of thee.\"]\r\n\r\nDiscoursing thus of various matters and faring on their way, on the\r\nlook out the while for time and place apt unto their knavish purpose,\r\nthey came, late in the day, to a place a little beyond Castel\r\nGuglielmo, where, at the fording of a river, the three rogues, seeing\r\nthe hour advanced and the spot solitary and close shut in, fell upon\r\nRinaldo and robbed him of money, clothes and horse. Then, leaving him\r\nafoot and in his shirt, they departed, saying, 'Go see if thy St.\r\nJulian will give thee a good lodging this night, even as ours[84] will\r\nassuredly do for us.' And passing the stream, they went their ways.\r\nRinaldo's servant, seeing him attacked, like a cowardly knave as he\r\nwas, did nought to help him, but turning his horse's head, never drew\r\nbridle till he came to Castel Guglielmo and entering the town, took up\r\nhis lodging there, without giving himself farther concern.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: _i.e._ our patron saint.]\r\n\r\nRinaldo, left in his shirt and barefoot, it being very cold and\r\nsnowing hard, knew not what to do and seeing the night already at\r\nhand, looked about him, trembling and chattering the while with his\r\nteeth, if there were any shelter to be seen therenigh, where he might\r\npass the night, so he should not perish of cold; but, seeing none, for\r\nthat a little before there had been war in those parts and everything\r\nhad been burnt, set off at a run, spurred by the cold, towards Castel\r\nGuglielmo, knowing not withal if his servant were fled thither or\r\notherwise and thinking that, so he might but avail to enter therein,\r\nGod would send him some relief. But darkness overtook him near a mile\r\nfrom the town, wherefore he arrived there so late that, the gates\r\nbeing shut and the draw-bridges raised, he could get no admission.\r\nThereupon, despairing and disconsolate, he looked about, weeping, for\r\na place where he might shelter, so at the least it should not snow\r\nupon him, and chancing to espy a house that projected somewhat beyond\r\nthe walls of the town, he determined to go bide thereunder till day.\r\nAccordingly, betaking himself thither, he found there a door, albeit\r\nit was shut, and gathering at foot thereof somewhat of straw that was\r\ntherenigh, he laid himself down there, tristful and woebegone,\r\ncomplaining sore to St. Julian and saying that this was not of the\r\nfaith he had in him.\r\n\r\nHowever, the saint had not lost sight of him and was not long in\r\nproviding him with a good lodging. There was in the town a widow lady,\r\nas fair of favour as any woman living, whom the Marquis Azzo loved as\r\nhis life and there kept at his disposition, and she abode in that same\r\nhouse, beneath the projection whereof Rinaldo had taken shelter. Now,\r\nas chance would have it, the Marquis had come to the town that day,\r\nthinking to lie the night with her, and had privily let make ready in\r\nher house a bath and a sumptuous supper. Everything being ready and\r\nnought awaited by the lady but the coming of the Marquis, it chanced\r\nthat there came a serving-man to the gate, who brought him news, which\r\nobliged him to take horse forthright; wherefore, sending to tell his\r\nmistress not to expect him, he departed in haste. The lady, somewhat\r\ndisconsolate at this, knowing not what to do, determined to enter the\r\nbath prepared for the Marquis and after sup and go to bed.\r\n\r\nAccordingly she entered the bath, which was near the door, against\r\nwhich the wretched merchant was crouched without the city-wall;\r\nwherefore she, being therein, heard the weeping and trembling kept up\r\nby Rinaldo, who seemed as he were grown a stork,[85] and calling her\r\nmaid, said to her, 'Go up and look over the wall who is at the\r\npostern-foot and what he doth there.' The maid went thither and aided\r\nby the clearness of the air, saw Rinaldo in his shirt and barefoot,\r\nsitting there, as hath been said, and trembling sore; whereupon she\r\nasked him who he was. He told her, as briefliest he might, who he was\r\nand how and why he was there, trembling the while on such wise that he\r\ncould scarce form the words, and after fell to beseeching her\r\npiteously not to leave him there all night to perish of cold, [but to\r\nsuccour him,] an it might be. The maid was moved to pity of him and\r\nreturning to her mistress, told her all. The lady, on like wise taking\r\ncompassion on him and remembering that she had the key of the door\r\naforesaid, which served whiles for the privy entrances of the Marquis,\r\nsaid, 'Go softly and open to him; here is this supper and none to eat\r\nit and we have commodity enough for his lodging.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: _i.e._ whose teeth chattered as it were the clapping of\r\na stork's beak.]\r\n\r\nThe maid, having greatly commended her mistress for this her humanity,\r\nwent and opening to Rinaldo, brought him in; whereupon the lady,\r\nseeing him well nigh palsied with cold, said to him, 'Quick, good man,\r\nenter this bath, which is yet warm.' Rinaldo, without awaiting farther\r\ninvitation, gladly obeyed and was so recomforted with the warmth of\r\nthe bath that himseemed he was come back from death to life. The lady\r\nlet fetch him a suit of clothes that had pertained to her husband,\r\nthen lately dead, which when he had donned, they seemed made to his\r\nmeasure, and whilst awaiting what she should command him, he fell to\r\nthanking God and St. Julian for that they had delivered him from the\r\nscurvy night he had in prospect and had, as he deemed, brought him to\r\ngood harbourage.\r\n\r\nPresently, the lady, being somewhat rested,[86] let make a great fire\r\nin her dining-hall and betaking herself thither, asked how it was with\r\nthe poor man; whereto the maid answered, 'Madam, he hath clad himself\r\nand is a handsome man and appeareth a person of good condition and\r\nvery well-mannered.' Quoth the lady, 'Go, call him and bid him come to\r\nthe fire and sup, for I know he is fasting.' Accordingly, Rinaldo\r\nentered the hall and seeing the gentlewoman, who appeared to him a\r\nlady of quality, saluted her respectfully and rendered her the best\r\nthanks in his power for the kindness done him. The lady, having seen\r\nand heard him and finding him even as her maid had said, received him\r\ngraciously and making him sit familiarly with her by the fire,\r\nquestioned him of the chance that had brought him thither; whereupon\r\nhe related everything to her in order. Now she had heard somewhat of\r\nthis at the time of his servant's coming into the town, wherefore she\r\ngave entire belief to all he said and told him, in turn, what she knew\r\nof his servant and how he might lightly find him again on the morrow.\r\nThen, the table being laid, Rinaldo, at the lady's instance, washed\r\nhis hands and sat down with her to supper. Now he was tall of his\r\nperson and comely and pleasant of favour and very engaging and\r\nagreeable of manners and a man in the prime of life; wherefore the\r\nlady had several times cast her eyes on him and found him much to her\r\nliking, and her desires being already aroused for the Marquis, who was\r\nto have come to lie with her, she had taken a mind to him.\r\nAccordingly, after supper, whenas they were risen from table, she took\r\ncounsel with her maid whether herseemed she would do well, the Marquis\r\nhaving left her in the lurch, to use the good which fortune had sent\r\nher. The maid, seeing her mistress's drift, encouraged her as best she\r\nmight to ensue it; whereupon the lady, returning to the fireside,\r\nwhere she had left Rinaldo alone, fell to gazing amorously upon him\r\nand said to him, 'How now, Rinaldo, why bide you thus melancholy?\r\nThink you you cannot be requited the loss of a horse and of some small\r\nmatter of clothes? Take comfort and be of good cheer; you are in your\r\nown house. Nay, I will e'en tell you more, that, seeing you with those\r\nclothes on your back, which were my late husband's, and meseeming you\r\nwere himself, there hath taken me belike an hundred times to-night a\r\nlonging to embrace you and kiss you: and but that I feared to\r\ndisplease you, I had certainly done it.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: _i.e._ after her bath.]\r\n\r\nRinaldo, who was no simpleton, hearing these words and seeing the\r\nlady's eyes sparkle, advanced towards her with open arms, saying,\r\n'Madam, considering that I owe it to you to say that I am now alive\r\nand having regard to that from which you delivered me, it were great\r\nunmannerliness in me, did I not study to do everything that may be\r\nagreeable to you; wherefore do you embrace me and kiss me to your\r\nheart's content, and I will kiss and clip you more than willingly.'\r\nThere needed no more words. The lady, who was all afire with amorous\r\nlonging, straightway threw herself into his arms and after she had\r\nstrained him desirefully to her bosom and bussed him a thousand times\r\nand had of him been kissed as often, they went off to her chamber, and\r\nthere without delay betaking themselves to bed, they fully and many a\r\ntime, before the day should come, satisfied their desires one of the\r\nother. Whenas the day began to appear, they arose,--it being her\r\npleasure, so the thing might not be suspected of any,--and she, having\r\ngiven him some sorry clothes and a purse full of money and shown him\r\nhow he should go about to enter the town and find his servant, put him\r\nforth at the postern whereby he had entered, praying him keep the\r\nmatter secret.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was broad day and the gates were opened, he entered the\r\ntown, feigning to come from afar, and found his servant. Therewithal\r\nhe donned the clothes that were in the saddle-bags and was about to\r\nmount the man's horse and depart, when, as by a miracle, it befell\r\nthat the three highwaymen, who had robbed him overnight, having been a\r\nlittle after taken for some other misdeed of them committed, were\r\nbrought into the town and on their confession, his horse and clothes\r\nand money were restored to him, nor did he lose aught save a pair of\r\ngarters, with which the robbers knew not what they had done. Rinaldo\r\naccordingly gave thanks to God and St. Julian and taking horse,\r\nreturned home, safe and sound, leaving the three rogues to go kick on\r\nthe morrow against the wind.\"[87]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: _i.e._ to be hanged or, in the equivalent English idiom,\r\nto dance upon nothing.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Second]\r\n\r\n     THREE YOUNG MEN SQUANDER THEIR SUBSTANCE AND BECOME POOR;\r\n     BUT A NEPHEW OF THEIRS, RETURNING HOME IN DESPERATION,\r\n     FALLETH IN WITH AN ABBOT AND FINDETH HIM TO BE THE KING'S\r\n     DAUGHTER OF ENGLAND, WHO TAKETH HIM TO HUSBAND AND MAKETH\r\n     GOOD ALL HIS UNCLES' LOSSES, RESTORING THEM TO GOOD ESTATE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe adventures of Rinaldo d'Asti were hearkened with admiration and\r\nhis devoutness commended by the ladies, who returned thanks to God and\r\nSt. Julian for that they had succoured him in his utmost need. Nor yet\r\n(though this was said half aside) was the lady reputed foolish, who\r\nhad known how to take the good God had sent her in her own house. But,\r\nwhilst they discoursed, laughing in their sleeves, of the pleasant\r\nnight she had had, Pampinea, seeing herself beside Filostrato and\r\ndeeming, as indeed it befell, that the next turn would rest with her,\r\nbegan to collect her thoughts and take counsel with herself what she\r\nshould say; after which, having received the queen's commandment, she\r\nproceeded to speak thus, no less resolutely than blithely, \"Noble\r\nladies, the more it is discoursed of the doings of Fortune, the more,\r\nto whoso is fain to consider her dealings aright, remaineth to be said\r\nthereof; and at this none should marvel, an he consider advisedly that\r\nall the things, which we foolishly style ours, are in her hands and\r\nare consequently, according to her hidden ordinance, transmuted by her\r\nwithout cease from one to another and back again, without any method\r\nknown unto us. Wherefore, albeit this truth is conclusively\r\ndemonstrated in everything and all day long and hath already been\r\nshown forth in divers of the foregoing stories, nevertheless, since it\r\nis our queen's pleasure that we discourse upon this theme, I will, not\r\nbelike without profit for the listeners, add to the stories aforesaid\r\none of my own, which methinketh should please.\r\n\r\nThere was once in our city a gentleman, by name Messer Tedaldo, who,\r\nas some will have it, was of the Lamberti family, albeit others avouch\r\nthat he was of the Agolanti, arguing more, belike, from the craft\r\nafter followed by his sons,[88] which was like unto that which the\r\nAgolanti have ever practised and yet practise, than from aught else.\r\nBut, leaving be of which of these two houses he was, I say that he\r\nwas, in his time, a very rich gentleman and had three sons, whereof\r\nthe eldest was named Lamberto, the second Tedaldo and the third\r\nAgolante, all handsome and sprightly youths, the eldest of whom had\r\nnot reached his eighteenth year when it befell that the aforesaid\r\nMesser Tedaldo died very rich and left all his possessions, both\r\nmoveable and immoveable, to them, as his legitimate heirs. The young\r\nmen, seeing themselves left very rich both in lands and monies, began\r\nto spend without check or reserve or other governance than that of\r\ntheir own pleasure, keeping a vast household and many and goodly\r\nhorses and dogs and hawks, still holding open house and giving\r\nlargesse and making tilts and tournaments and doing not only that\r\nwhich pertaineth unto men of condition, but all, to boot, that it\r\noccurred to their youthful appetite to will.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: _i.e._ usury? See post. One of the commentators\r\nridiculously suggests that they were needlemakers, from _ago_, a\r\nneedle.]\r\n\r\nThey had not long led this manner of life before the treasure left by\r\ntheir father melted away and their revenues alone sufficing not unto\r\ntheir current expenses, they proceeded to sell and mortgage their\r\nestates, and selling one to-day and another to-morrow, they found\r\nthemselves well nigh to nought, without perceiving it, and poverty\r\nopened their eyes, which wealth had kept closed. Whereupon Lamberto,\r\none day, calling the other two, reminded them how great had been their\r\nfather's magnificence and how great their own and setting before them\r\nwhat wealth had been theirs and the poverty to which they were come\r\nthrough their inordinate expenditure, exhorted them, as best he knew,\r\nere their distress should become more apparent, to sell what little\r\nwas left them and get them gone, together with himself. They did as he\r\ncounselled them and departing Florence, without leavetaking or\r\nceremony, stayed not till they came to England, where, taking a little\r\nhouse in London and spending very little, they addressed themselves\r\nwith the utmost diligence to lend money at usance. In this fortune was\r\nso favourable to them that in a few years they amassed a vast sum of\r\nmoney, wherewith, returning to Florence, one after another, they\r\nbought back great part of their estates and purchased others to boot\r\nand took unto themselves wives.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, they still continued to lend money in England and sent\r\nthither, to look to their affairs, a young man, a nephew of theirs,\r\nAlessandro by name, whilst themselves all three at Florence, for all\r\nthey were become fathers of families, forgetting to what a pass\r\ninordinate expenditure had aforetime brought them, began to spend more\r\nextravagantly than ever and were high in credit with all the\r\nmerchants, who trusted them for any sum of money, however great. The\r\nmonies remitted them by Alessandro, who had fallen to lending to the\r\nbarons upon their castles and other their possessions, which brought\r\nhim great profit, helped them for some years to support these\r\nexpenses; but, presently, what while the three brothers spent thus\r\nfreely and lacking money, borrowed, still reckoning with all assurance\r\nupon England, it chanced that, contrary to all expectation, there\r\nbroke out war in England between the king and his son, through which\r\nthe whole island was divided into two parties, some holding with the\r\none and some with the other; and by reason thereof all the barons'\r\ncastles were taken from Alessandro nor was there any other source of\r\nrevenue that answered him aught. Hoping that from day to day peace\r\nshould be made between father and son and consequently everything\r\nrestored to him, both interest and capital, Alessandro departed not\r\nthe island and the three brothers in Florence no wise abated their\r\nextravagant expenditure, borrowing more and more every day. But, when,\r\nafter several years, no effect was seen to follow upon their\r\nexpectation, the three brothers not only lost their credit, but, their\r\ncreditors seeking to be paid their due, they were suddenly arrested\r\nand their possessions sufficing not unto payment, they abode in\r\nprison for the residue, whilst their wives and little ones betook\r\nthemselves, some into the country, some hither and some thither, in\r\nvery ill plight, unknowing what to expect but misery for the rest of\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Alessandro, after waiting several years in England for\r\npeace, seeing that it came not and himseeming that not only was his\r\ntarrying there in vain, but that he went in danger of his life,\r\ndetermined to return to Italy. Accordingly, he set out all alone and\r\nas chance would have it, coming out of Bruges, he saw an abbot of\r\nwhite friars likewise issuing thence, accompanied by many monks and\r\nwith a numerous household and a great baggage-train in his van. After\r\nhim came two old knights, kinsmen of the King, whom Alessandro\r\naccosted as acquaintances and was gladly admitted into their company.\r\nAs he journeyed with them, he asked them softly who were the monks\r\nthat rode in front with so great a train and whither they were bound;\r\nand one of them answered, 'He who rideth yonder is a young gentleman\r\nof our kindred, who hath been newly elected abbot of one of the most\r\nconsiderable abbeys of England, and for that he is younger than is\r\nsuffered by the laws for such a dignity, we go with him to Rome to\r\nobtain of the Holy Father that he dispense him of his defect of\r\novermuch youthfulness and confirm him in the dignity aforesaid; but\r\nthis must not be spoken of with any.'\r\n\r\nThe new abbot, faring on thus, now in advance of his retinue and now\r\nin their rear, as daily we see it happen with noblemen on a journey,\r\nchanced by the way to see near him Alessandro, who was a young man\r\nexceedingly goodly of person and favour, well-bred, agreeable and fair\r\nof fashion as any might be, and who at first sight pleased him\r\nmarvellously, as nought had ever done, and calling him to his side,\r\nfell a-discoursing pleasantly with him, asking him who he was and\r\nwhence he came and whither he was bound; whereupon Alessandro frankly\r\ndiscovered to him his whole case and satisfied his questions, offering\r\nhimself to his service in what little he might. The abbot, hearing his\r\ngoodly and well-ordered speech, took more particular note of his\r\nmanners and inwardly judging him to be a man of gentle breeding, for\r\nall his business had been mean, grew yet more enamoured of his\r\npleasantness and full of compassion for his mishaps, comforted him on\r\nvery friendly wise, bidding him be of good hope, for that, an he were\r\na man of worth, God would yet replace him in that estate whence\r\nfortune had cast him down, nay, in a yet higher. Moreover, he prayed\r\nhim, since he was bound for Tuscany, that it would please him bear him\r\ncompany, inasmuch as himself was likewise on the way thitherward;\r\nwhereupon Alessandro returned him thanks for his encouragement and\r\ndeclared himself ready to his every commandment.\r\n\r\nThe abbot, in whose breast new feelings had been aroused by the sight\r\nof Alessandro, continuing his journey, it chanced that, after some\r\ndays, they came to a village not overwell furnished with hostelries,\r\nand the abbot having a mind to pass the night there, Alessandro caused\r\nhim alight at the house of an innkeeper, who was his familiar\r\nacquaintance, and let prepare him his sleeping-chamber in the least\r\nincommodious place of the house; and being now, like an expert man as\r\nhe was, grown well nigh a master of the household to the abbot, he\r\nlodged all his company, as best he might, about the village, some here\r\nand some there. After the abbot had supped, the night being now well\r\nadvanced and every one gone to bed, Alessandro asked the host where he\r\nhimself could lie; whereto he answered, 'In truth, I know not; thou\r\nseest that every place is full and I and my household must needs sleep\r\nupon the benches. Algates, in the abbot's chamber there be certain\r\ngrain-sacks, whereto I can bring thee and spread thee thereon some\r\nsmall matter of bed, and there, an it please thee, thou shalt lie this\r\nnight, as best thou mayst.' Quoth Alessandro, 'How shall I go into the\r\nabbot's chamber, seeing thou knowest it is little and of its\r\nstraitness none of his monks might lie there? Had I bethought me of\r\nthis, ere the curtains were drawn, I would have let his monks lie on\r\nthe grain-sacks and have lodged myself where they sleep.' 'Nay,'\r\nanswered the host, 'the case standeth thus;[89] but, an thou wilt,\r\nthou mayst lie whereas I tell thee with all the ease in the world. The\r\nabbot is asleep and his curtains are drawn; I will quickly lay thee a\r\npallet-bed there, and do thou sleep on it.' Alessandro, seeing that\r\nthis might be done without giving the abbot any annoy, consented\r\nthereto and settled himself on the grain-sacks as softliest he might.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: _i.e._ the thing is done and cannot be undone; there is\r\nno help for it.]\r\n\r\nThe abbot, who slept not, nay, whose thoughts were ardently occupied\r\nwith his new desires, heard what passed between Alessandro and the\r\nhost and noted where the former laid himself to sleep, and well\r\npleased with this, began to say in himself, 'God hath sent an occasion\r\nunto my desires; an I take it not, it may be long ere the like recur\r\nto me.' Accordingly, being altogether resolved to take the opportunity\r\nand himseeming all was quiet in the inn, he called to Alessandro in a\r\nlow voice and bade him come couch with him. Alessandro, after many\r\nexcuses, put off his clothes and laid himself beside the abbot, who\r\nput his hand on his breast and fell to touching him no otherwise than\r\namorous damsels use to do with their lovers; whereat Alessandro\r\nmarvelled exceedingly and misdoubted him the abbot was moved by\r\nunnatural love to handle him on that wise; but the latter promptly\r\ndivined his suspicions, whether of presumption or through some gesture\r\nof his, and smiled; then, suddenly putting off a shirt that he wore,\r\nhe took Alessandro's hand and laying it on his own breast, said,\r\n'Alessandro, put away thy foolish thought and searching here, know\r\nthat which I conceal.'\r\n\r\nAlessandro accordingly put his hand to the abbot's bosom and found\r\nthere two little breasts, round and firm and delicate, no otherwise\r\nthan as they were of ivory, whereby perceiving that the supposed\r\nprelate was a woman, without awaiting farther bidding, he straightway\r\ntook her in his arms and would have kissed her; but she said to him,\r\n'Ere thou draw nearer to me, hearken to that which I have to say to\r\nthee. As thou mayst see, I am a woman and not a man, and having left\r\nhome a maid, I was on my way to the Pope, that he might marry me. Be\r\nit thy good fortune or my mishap, no sooner did I see thee the other\r\nday than love so fired me for thee, that never yet was woman who so\r\nloved man. Wherefore, I am resolved to take thee, before any other, to\r\nhusband; but, an thou wilt not have me to wife, begone hence\r\nforthright and return to thy place.'\r\n\r\nAlessandro, albeit he knew her not, having regard to her company and\r\nretinue, judged her to be of necessity noble and rich and saw that she\r\nwas very fair; wherefore, without overlong thought, he replied that,\r\nif this pleased her, it was mighty agreeable to him. Accordingly,\r\nsitting up with him in bed, she put a ring into his hand and made him\r\nespouse her[90] before a picture wherein our Lord was portrayed, after\r\nwhich they embraced each other and solaced themselves with amorous\r\ndalliance, to the exceeding pleasure of both parties, for so much as\r\nremained of the night.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: _i.e._ make her a solemn promise of marriage, formally\r\nplight her his troth. The ceremony of betrothal was formerly (and\r\nstill is in certain countries) the most essential part of the marriage\r\nrite.]\r\n\r\nWhen the day came, after they had taken order together concerning\r\ntheir affairs, Alessandro arose and departed the chamber by the way he\r\nhad entered, without any knowing where he had passed the night. Then,\r\nglad beyond measure, he took to the road again with the abbot and his\r\ncompany and came after many days to Rome. There they abode some days,\r\nafter which the abbot, with the two knights and Alessandro and no\r\nmore, went in to the Pope and having done him due reverence, bespoke\r\nhim thus, 'Holy Father, as you should know better than any other,\r\nwhoso is minded to live well and honestly should, inasmuch as he may,\r\neschew every occasion that may lead him to do otherwise; the which\r\nthat I, who would fain live honestly, may throughly do, having fled\r\nprivily with a great part of the treasures of the King of England my\r\nfather, (who would have given me to wife to the King of Scotland, a\r\nvery old prince, I being, as you see, a young maid), I set out,\r\nhabited as you see me, to come hither, so your Holiness might marry\r\nme. Nor was it so much the age of the King of Scotland that made me\r\nflee as the fear, if I were married to him, lest I should, for the\r\nfrailty of my youth, be led to do aught that might be contrary to the\r\nDivine laws and the honour of the royal blood of my father. As I came,\r\nthus disposed, God, who alone knoweth aright that which behoveth unto\r\nevery one, set before mine eyes (as I believe, of His mercy) him whom\r\nit pleased Him should be my husband, to wit, this young man,' showing\r\nAlessandro, 'whom you see here beside me and whose fashions and desert\r\nare worthy of however great a lady, although belike the nobility of\r\nhis blood is not so illustrious as the blood-royal. Him, then, have I\r\ntaken and him I desire, nor will I ever have any other than he,\r\nhowever it may seem to my father or to other folk. Thus, the principal\r\noccasion of my coming is done away; but it pleased me to make an end\r\nof my journey, at once that I might visit the holy and reverential\r\nplaces, whereof this city is full, and your Holiness and that through\r\nyou I might make manifest, in your presence and consequently in that\r\nof the rest of mankind, the marriage contracted between Alessandro\r\nand myself in the presence of God alone. Wherefore I humbly pray you\r\nthat this which hath pleased God and me may find favour with you and\r\nthat you will vouchsafe us your benison, in order that with this, as\r\nwith more assurance of His approof whose Vicar you are, we may live\r\nand ultimately die together.'\r\n\r\nAlessandro marvelled to hear that the damsel was the King's daughter\r\nof England and was inwardly filled with exceeding great gladness; but\r\nthe two knights marvelled yet more and were so incensed, that, had\r\nthey been otherwhere than in the Pope's presence, they had done\r\nAlessandro a mischief and belike the lady also. The Pope also, on his\r\npart, marvelled exceedingly both at the habit of the lady and at her\r\nchoice; but, seeing that there was no going back on that which was\r\ndone, he consented to satisfy her of her prayer. Accordingly, having\r\nfirst appeased the two knights, whom he knew to be angered, and made\r\nthem well at one again with the lady and Alessandro, he took order for\r\nthat which was to do, and the day appointed by him being come, before\r\nall the cardinals and many other men of great worship, come, at his\r\nbidding, to a magnificent bride-feast prepared by him, he produced the\r\nlady, royally apparelled, who showed so fair and so agreeable that she\r\nwas worthily commended of all, and on like wise Alessandro splendidly\r\nattired, in bearing and appearance no whit like a youth who had lent\r\nat usury, but rather one of royal blood, and now much honoured of the\r\ntwo knights. There he caused solemnly celebrate the marriage afresh\r\nand after goodly and magnificent nuptials made, he dismissed them with\r\nhis benison.\r\n\r\nIt pleased Alessandro, and likewise the lady, departing Rome, to\r\nbetake themselves to Florence, whither report had already carried the\r\nnews. There they were received by the townsfolk with the utmost honour\r\nand the lady caused liberate the three brothers, having first paid\r\nevery man [his due]. Moreover, she reinstated them and their ladies in\r\ntheir possessions and with every one's goodwill, because of this, she\r\nand her husband departed Florence, carrying Agolante with them, and\r\ncoming to Paris, were honourably entertained by the King. Thence the\r\ntwo knights passed into England and so wrought with the King that the\r\nlatter restored to his daughter his good graces and with exceeding\r\ngreat rejoicing received her and his son-in-law, whom he a little\r\nafter made a knight with the utmost honour and gave him the Earldom of\r\nCornwall. In this capacity he approved himself a man of such parts and\r\nmade shift to do on such wise that he reconciled the son with his\r\nfather, whereof there ensued great good to the island, and thereby he\r\ngained the love and favour of all the people of the country.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Agolante thoroughly recovered all that was there due to him\r\nand his brethren and returned to Florence, rich beyond measure, having\r\nfirst been knighted by Count Alessandro. The latter lived long and\r\ngloriously with his lady, and according as some avouch, what with his\r\nwit and valour and the aid of his father-in-law, he after conquered\r\nScotland and was crowned King thereof.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Second]\r\n\r\n     LANDOLFO RUFFOLO, GROWN POOR, TURNETH CORSAIR AND BEING\r\n     TAKEN BY THE GENOESE, IS WRECKED AT SEA, BUT SAVETH HIMSELF\r\n     UPON A COFFER FULL OF JEWELS OF PRICE AND BEING ENTERTAINED\r\n     IN CORFU BY A WOMAN, RETURNETH HOME RICH\r\n\r\n\r\nLauretta, who sat next Pampinea, seeing her come to the glorious\r\nending of her story, began, without awaiting more, to speak on this\r\nwise: \"Most gracious ladies, there can, to my judgment, be seen no\r\ngreater feat of fortune than when we behold one raised from the lowest\r\nmisery to royal estate, even as Pampinea's story hath shown it to have\r\nbetided her Alessandro. And for that from this time forth whosoever\r\nrelateth of the appointed matter must of necessity speak within these\r\nlimits,[91] I shall think no shame to tell a story, which, albeit it\r\ncompriseth in itself yet greater distresses hath not withal so\r\nsplendid an issue. I know well, indeed, that, having regard unto that,\r\nmy story will be hearkened with less diligence; but, as I can no\r\notherwise, I shall be excused.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: _i.e._ cannot hope to tell a story presenting more\r\nextraordinary shifts from one to the other extreme of human fortune\r\nthan that of Pampinea.]\r\n\r\nThe sea-coast from Reggio to Gaeta is commonly believed to be well\r\nnigh the most delightful part of Italy, and therein, pretty near\r\nSalerno, is a hillside overlooking the sea, which the countryfolk call\r\nAmalfi Side, full of little towns and gardens and springs and of men\r\nas rich and stirring in the matter of trade as any in the world. Among\r\nthe said cities is one called Ravello and therein, albeit nowadays\r\nthere are rich men there, there was aforetime one, Landolfo Ruffolo by\r\nname, who was exceeding rich and who, his wealth sufficing him not,\r\ncame nigh, in seeking to double it, to lose it all and himself withal.\r\nThis man, then, having, after the usance of merchants, laid his plans,\r\nbought a great ship and freighting it all of his own monies with\r\ndivers merchandise, repaired therewith to Cyprus. There he found\r\nsundry other ships come with the same kind and quality of merchandise\r\nas he had brought, by reason of which not only was he constrained to\r\nmake great good cheap of his own venture, but it behoved him, an he\r\nwould dispose of his goods, well nigh to throw them away, whereby he\r\nwas brought near unto ruin.\r\n\r\nSore chagrined at this mischance and knowing not what to do, seeing\r\nhimself thus from a very rich man in brief space grown in a manner\r\npoor, he determined either to die or repair his losses by pillage, so\r\nhe might not return thither poor, whence he had departed rich.\r\nAccordingly, having found a purchaser for his great ship, with the\r\nprice thereof and that which he had gotten of his wares, he bought a\r\nlittle vessel, light and apt for cruising and arming and garnishing it\r\nexcellent well with everything needful unto such a service, addressed\r\nhimself to make his purchase of other men's goods and especially of\r\nthose of the Turks. In this trade fortune was far kinder to him than\r\nshe had been in that of a merchant, for that, in some year's space,\r\nhe plundered and took so many Turkish vessels that he found he had not\r\nonly gotten him his own again that he had lost in trade, but had more\r\nthan doubled his former substance. Whereupon, schooled by the chagrin\r\nof his former loss and deeming he had enough, he persuaded himself,\r\nrather than risk a second mischance, to rest content with that which\r\nhe had, without seeking more. Accordingly he resolved to return\r\ntherewith to his own country and being fearful of trade, concerned not\r\nhimself to employ his money otherwise, but, thrusting his oars into\r\nthe water, set out homeward in that same little vessel wherewith he\r\nhad gained it.\r\n\r\nHe had already reached the Archipelago when there arose one evening a\r\nviolent south-east wind, which was not only contrary to his course,\r\nbut raised so great a sea that his little vessel could not endure it;\r\nwherefore he took refuge in a bight of the sea, made by a little\r\nisland, and there abode sheltered from the wind and purposing there to\r\nawait better weather. He had not lain there long when two great\r\nGenoese carracks, coming from Constantinople, made their way with\r\ngreat difficulty into the little harbour, to avoid that from which\r\nhimself had fled. The newcomers espied the little ship and hearing\r\nthat it pertained to Landolfo, whom they already knew by report to be\r\nvery rich, blocked against it the way by which it might depart and\r\naddressed themselves, like men by nature rapacious and greedy of\r\ngain,[92] to make prize of it. Accordingly, they landed part of their\r\nmen well harnessed and armed with crossbows and posted them on such\r\nwise that none might come down from the bark, an he would not be shot;\r\nwhilst the rest, warping themselves in with small boats and aided by\r\nthe current, laid Landolfo's little ship aboard and took it out of\r\nhand, crew and all, without missing a man. Landolfo they carried\r\naboard one of the carracks, leaving him but a sorry doublet; then,\r\ntaking everything out of the ship, they scuttled her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: The Genoese have the reputation in Italy of being\r\nthieves by nature.]\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, the wind having shifted, the carracks made sail\r\nwestward and fared on their voyage prosperously all that day; but\r\ntowards evening there arose a tempestuous wind which made the waves\r\nrun mountains high and parted the two carracks one from the other.\r\nMoreover, from stress of wind it befell that that wherein was the\r\nwretched and unfortunate Landolfo smote with great violence upon a\r\nshoal over against the island of Cephalonia and parting amidships,\r\nbroke all in sunder no otherwise than a glass dashed against a wall.\r\nThe sea was in a moment all full of bales of merchandise and chests\r\nand planks, that floated on the surface, as is wont to happen in such\r\ncases, and the poor wretches on board, swimming, those who knew how,\r\nalbeit it was a very dark night and the sea was exceeding great and\r\nswollen, fell to laying hold of such things as came within their\r\nreach. Among the rest the unfortunate Landolfo, albeit many a time\r\nthat day he had called for death, (choosing rather to die than return\r\nhome poor as he found himself,) seeing it near at hand, was fearful\r\nthereof and like the others, laid hold of a plank that came to his\r\nhand, so haply, an he put off drowning awhile, God might send him\r\nsome means of escape.\r\n\r\nBestriding this, he kept himself afloat as best he might, driven\r\nhither and thither of the sea and the wind, till daylight, when he\r\nlooked about him and saw nothing but clouds and sea and a chest\r\nfloating on the waves, which bytimes, to his sore affright, drew nigh\r\nunto him, for that he feared lest peradventure it should dash against\r\nhim on such wise as to do him a mischief; wherefore, as often as it\r\ncame near him, he put it away from him as best he might with his hand,\r\nalbeit he had little strength thereof. But presently there issued a\r\nsudden flaw of wind out of the air and falling on the sea, smote upon\r\nthe chest and drove it with such violence against Landolfo's plank\r\nthat the latter was overset and he himself perforce went under water.\r\nHowever, he struck out and rising to the surface, aided more by fear\r\nthan by strength, saw the plank far removed from him, wherefore,\r\nfearing he might be unable to reach it again, he made for the chest,\r\nwhich was pretty near him, and laying himself flat with his breast on\r\nthe lid thereof, guided it with his arms as best he might.[93]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: It seems doubtful whether _la reggeva diritta_ should\r\nnot rather be rendered \"kept it upright.\" Boccaccio has a knack, very\r\ntrying to the translator, of constantly using words in an obscure or\r\nstrained sense.]\r\n\r\nOn this wise, tossed about by the sea now hither and now thither,\r\nwithout eating, as one indeed who had not the wherewithal, but\r\ndrinking more than he could have wished, he abode all that day and the\r\nensuing night, unknowing where he was and descrying nought but sea;\r\nbut, on the following day, whether it was God's pleasure or stress of\r\nwind that wrought it, he came, grown well nigh a sponge and clinging\r\nfast with both hands to the marges of the chest, even as we see those\r\ndo who are like to drown, to the coast of the island of Corfu, where a\r\npoor woman chanced to be scouring her pots and pans and making them\r\nbright with sand and salt water. Seeing Landolfo draw near and\r\ndiscerning in him no [human] shape, she drew back, affrighted and\r\ncrying out. He could not speak and scarce saw, wherefore he said\r\nnothing; but presently, the sea carrying him landward, the woman\r\ndescried the shape of the chest and looking straitlier, perceived\r\nfirst the arms outspread upon it and then the face and guessed it for\r\nthat which it was.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, moved with compassion, she entered somedele into the sea,\r\nwhich was now calm, and seizing Landolfo by the hair, dragged him\r\nashore, chest and all. There having with difficulty unclasped his\r\nhands from the chest, she set the latter on the head of a young\r\ndaughter of hers, who was with her, and carried him off, as he were a\r\nlittle child, to her hut, where she put him in a bagnio and so chafed\r\nand bathed him with warm water that the strayed heat returned to him,\r\ntogether with somewhat of his lost strength. Then, taking him up out\r\nof the bath, whenas it seemed good to her, she comforted him with\r\nsomewhat of good wine and confections and tended him some days, as\r\nbest she might, till he had recovered his strength and knew where he\r\nwas, when she judged it time to restore him his chest, which she had\r\nkept safe for him, and to tell him that he might now prosecute his\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nLandolfo, who had no recollection of the chest, yet took it, when the\r\ngood woman presented it to him, thinking it could not be so little\r\nworth but that it might defray his expenses for some days, but,\r\nfinding it very light, was sore abated of his hopes. Nevertheless,\r\nwhat while his hostess was abroad, he broke it open, to see what it\r\ncontained, and found therein store of precious stones, both set and\r\nunset. He had some knowledge of these matters and seeing them, knew\r\nthem to be of great value; wherefore he praised God, who had not yet\r\nforsaken him, and was altogether comforted. However, as one who had in\r\nbrief space been twice cruelly baffled by fortune, fearing a third\r\nmisadventure, he bethought himself that it behoved him use great\r\nwariness and he would bring those things home; wherefore, wrapping\r\nthem, as best he might, in some rags, he told the good woman that he\r\nhad no more occasion for the chest, but that, an it pleased her, she\r\nshould give him a bag and take the chest herself. This she willingly\r\ndid and he, having rendered her the best thanks in his power for the\r\nkindness received from her, shouldered his bag and going aboard a\r\nbark, passed over to Brindisi and thence made his way, along the\r\ncoast, to Trani.\r\n\r\nHere he found certain townsmen of his, who were drapers and clad him\r\nfor the love of God,[94] after he had related to them all his\r\nadventures, except that of the chest; nay more, they lent him a horse\r\nand sent him, under escort, to Ravello, whither he said he would fain\r\nreturn. There, deeming himself in safety and thanking God who had\r\nconducted him thither, he opened his bag and examining everything more\r\ndiligently than he had yet done, found he had so many and such stones\r\nthat, supposing he sold them at a fair price or even less, he was\r\ntwice as rich again as when he departed thence. Then, finding means to\r\ndispose of his jewels, he sent a good sum of money to Corfu to the\r\ngood woman who had brought him forth of the sea, in requital of the\r\nservice received, and the like to Trani to those who had reclothed\r\nhim. The rest he kept for himself and lived in honour and worship to\r\nthe end of his days, without seeking to trade any more.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: _i.e._ for nothing.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Second]\r\n\r\n     ANDREUCCIO OF PERUGIA, COMING TO NAPLES TO BUY HORSES, IS IN\r\n     ONE NIGHT OVERTAKEN WITH THREE GRIEVOUS ACCIDENTS, BUT\r\n     ESCAPETH THEM ALL AND RETURNETH HOME WITH A RUBY\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The stones found by Landolfo,\" began Fiammetta, to whose turn it came\r\nto tell, \"have brought to my mind a story scarce less full of perilous\r\nscapes than that related by Lauretta, but differing therefrom inasmuch\r\nas the adventures comprised in the latter befell in the course of\r\nbelike several years and these of which I have to tell in the space\r\nof a single night, as you shall hear.\r\n\r\nThere was once in Perugia, as I have heard tell aforetime, a young\r\nman, a horse-courser, by name Andreuccio di Pietro,[95] who, hearing\r\nthat horses were good cheap at Naples, put five hundred gold florins\r\nin his purse and betook himself thither with other merchants, having\r\nnever before been away from home. He arrived there one Sunday evening,\r\ntowards vespers, and having taken counsel with his host, sallied forth\r\nnext morning to the market, where he saw great plenty of horses. Many\r\nof them pleased him and he cheapened one and another, but could not\r\ncome to an accord concerning any. Meanwhile, to show that he was for\r\nbuying, he now and again, like a raw unwary clown as he was, pulled\r\nout the purse of florins he had with him, in the presence of those who\r\ncame and went. As he was thus engaged, with his purse displayed, it\r\nchanced that a Sicilian damsel, who was very handsome, but disposed\r\nfor a small matter to do any man's pleasure, passed near him, without\r\nhis seeing her, and catching sight of the purse, said straightway in\r\nherself, 'Who would fare better than I, if yonder money were mine!'\r\nAnd passed on.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: _i.e._ son of Pietro, as they still say in Lancashire\r\nand other northern provinces, \"Tom o' Dick\" for \"Thomas, son of\r\nRichard,\" etc.]\r\n\r\nNow there was with her an old woman, likewise a Sicilian, who, seeing\r\nAndreuccio, let her companion pass on and running to him, embraced him\r\naffectionately, which when the damsel saw, she stepped aside to wait\r\nfor her, without saying aught. Andreuccio, turning to the old woman\r\nand recognizing her, gave her a hearty greeting and she, having\r\npromised to visit him at his inn, took leave, without holding overlong\r\nparley there, whilst he fell again to chaffering, but bought nothing\r\nthat morning. The damsel, who had noted first Andreuccio's purse and\r\nafter her old woman's acquaintance with him, began cautiously to\r\nenquire of the latter, by way of casting about for a means of coming\r\nat the whole or part of the money, who and whence he was and what he\r\ndid there and how she came to know him. The old woman told her every\r\nparticular of Andreuccio's affairs well nigh as fully as he himself\r\ncould have done, having long abidden with his father, first in Sicily\r\nand after at Perugia, and acquainted her, to boot, where he lodged and\r\nwherefore he was come thither.\r\n\r\nThe damsel, being thus fully informed both of his name and parentage,\r\nthereby with subtle craft laid her plans for giving effect to her\r\ndesire and returning home, set the old woman awork for the rest of the\r\nday, so she might not avail to return to Andreuccio. Then, calling a\r\nmaid of hers, whom she had right well lessoned unto such offices, she\r\ndespatched her, towards evensong, to the inn where Andreuccio lodged.\r\nAs chance would have it, she found him alone at the door and enquired\r\nat him of himself. He answered that he was the man she sought,\r\nwhereupon she drew him aside and said to him, 'Sir, an it please you,\r\na gentlewoman of this city would fain speak with you.' Andreuccio,\r\nhearing this, considered himself from head to foot and himseeming he\r\nwas a handsome varlet of his person, he concluded (as if there were\r\nno other well-looking young fellow to be found in Naples,) that the\r\nlady in question must have fallen in love with him. Accordingly, he\r\nanswered without further deliberation that he was ready and asked the\r\ngirl when and where the lady would speak with him; whereto she\r\nanswered, 'Sir, whenas it pleaseth you to come, she awaiteth you in\r\nher house'; and Andreuccio forthwith rejoined, without saying aught to\r\nthe people of the inn, 'Go thou on before; I will come after thee.'\r\n\r\nThereupon the girl carried him to the house of her mistress, who dwelt\r\nin a street called Malpertugio,[96] the very name whereof denoteth how\r\nreputable a quarter it is. But he, unknowing neither suspecting aught\r\nthereof and thinking to go to most honourable place and to a lady of\r\nquality, entered the house without hesitation,--preceded by the\r\nserving-maid, who called her mistress and said, 'Here is\r\nAndreuccio,'--and mounting the stair, saw the damsel come to the\r\nstairhead to receive him. Now she was yet in the prime of youth, tall\r\nof person, with a very fair face and very handsomely dressed and\r\nadorned. As he drew near her, she came down three steps to meet him\r\nwith open arms and clasping him round the neck, abode awhile without\r\nspeaking, as if hindered by excess of tenderness; then kissed him on\r\nthe forehead, weeping, and said, in a somewhat broken voice, 'O my\r\nAndreuccio, thou art indeed welcome.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: _i.e._ ill hole.]\r\n\r\nHe was amazed at such tender caresses and answered, all confounded,\r\n'Madam, you are well met.' Thereupon, taking him by the hand, she\r\ncarried him up into her saloon and thence, without saying another word\r\nto him, she brought him into her chamber, which was all redolent of\r\nroses and orange flowers and other perfumes. Here he saw a very fine\r\nbed, hung round with curtains, and store of dresses upon the pegs and\r\nother very goodly and rich gear, after the usance of those parts; by\r\nreason whereof, like a freshman as he was, he firmly believed her to\r\nbe no less than a great lady. She made him sit with her on a chest\r\nthat stood at the foot of the bed and bespoke him thus, 'Andreuccio, I\r\nam very certain thou marvellest at these caresses that I bestow on\r\nthee and at my tears, as he may well do who knoweth me not and hath\r\nmaybe never heard speak of me; but I have that to tell thee which is\r\nlike to amaze thee yet more, namely, that I am thy sister; and I tell\r\nthee that, since God hath vouchsafed me to look upon one of my\r\nbrothers, (though fain would I see you all,) before my death,\r\nhenceforth I shall not die disconsolate; and as perchance thou has\r\nnever heard of this, I will tell it thee.\r\n\r\nPietro, my father and thine, as I doubt not thou knowest, abode long\r\nin Palermo and there for his good humour and pleasant composition was\r\nand yet is greatly beloved of those who knew him; but, among all his\r\nlovers, my mother, who was a lady of gentle birth and then a widow,\r\nwas she who most affected him, insomuch that, laying aside the fear of\r\nher father and brethren, as well as the care of her own honour, she\r\nbecame so private with him that I was born thereof and grew up as thou\r\nseest me. Presently, having occasion to depart Palermo and return to\r\nPerugia, he left me a little maid with my mother nor ever after, for\r\nall that I could hear, remembered him of me or her; whereof, were he\r\nnot my father, I should blame him sore, having regard to the\r\ningratitude shown by him to my mother (to say nothing of the love it\r\nbehoved him bear me, as his daughter, born of no serving-wench nor\r\nwoman of mean extraction) who had, moved by very faithful love,\r\nwithout anywise knowing who he might be, committed into his hands her\r\npossessions and herself no less. But what [skilleth it]? Things ill\r\ndone and long time passed are easier blamed than mended; algates, so\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nHe left me a little child in Palermo, where being grown well nigh as I\r\nam now, my mother, who was a rich lady, gave me to wife to a worthy\r\ngentleman of Girgenti, who, for her love and mine, came to abide at\r\nPalermo and there, being a great Guelph,[97] he entered into treaty\r\nwith our King Charles,[98] which, being discovered by King\r\nFrederick,[99] ere effect could be given to it, was the occasion of\r\nour being enforced to flee from Sicily, whenas I looked to be the\r\ngreatest lady was ever in the island; wherefore, taking such few\r\nthings as we might (I say few, in respect of the many we had) and\r\nleaving our lands and palaces, we took refuge in this city, where we\r\nfound King Charles so mindful of our services that he hath in part\r\nmade good to us the losses we had sustained for him, bestowing on us\r\nboth lands and houses, and still maketh my husband, thy kinsman that\r\nis, a goodly provision, as thou shalt hereafter see. On this wise come\r\nI in this city, where, Godamercy and no thanks to thee, sweet my\r\nbrother, I now behold thee.' So saying, she embraced him over again\r\nand kissed him on the forehead, still weeping for tenderness.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: _i.e._ a member of the Guelph party, as against the\r\nGhibellines or partisans of the Pope.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: Charles d'Anjou, afterwards King of Sicily.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: _i.e._ Frederick II. of Germany.]\r\n\r\nAndreuccio, hearing this fable so orderly, so artfully delivered by\r\nthe damsel, without ever stammering or faltering for a word, and\r\nremembering it to be true that his father had been in Palermo,\r\nknowing, moreover, by himself the fashions of young men and how\r\nlightly they fall in love in their youth and seeing the affectionate\r\ntears and embraces and the chaste kisses that she lavished on him,\r\nheld all she told him for more than true; wherefore, as soon as she\r\nwas silent, he answered her, saying, 'Madam, it should seem to you no\r\nvery great matter if I marvel, for that in truth, whether it be that\r\nmy father, for whatsoever reason, never spoke of your mother nor of\r\nyourself, or that if he did, it came not to my notice, I had no more\r\nknowledge of you than if you had never been, and so much the dearer is\r\nit to me to find you my sister here, as I am alone in this city and\r\nthe less expected this. Indeed, I know no man of so high a condition\r\nthat you should not be dear to him, to say nothing of myself, who am\r\nbut a petty trader. But I pray you make me clear of one thing; how\r\nknew you that I was here?' Whereto she made answer, 'A poor woman, who\r\nmuch frequenteth me, gave me this morning to know of thy coming, for\r\nthat, as she telleth me, she abode long with our father both at\r\nPalermo and at Perugia; and but that meseemed it was a more reputable\r\nthing that thou shouldst visit me in my own house than I thee in that\r\nof another, I had come to thee this great while agone.' After this,\r\nshe proceeded to enquire more particularly of all his kinsfolk by\r\nname, and he answered her of all, giving the more credence, by reason\r\nof this, to that which it the less behoved him to believe.\r\n\r\nThe talk being long and the heat great, she called for Greek wine and\r\nconfections and let give Andreuccio to drink, after which he would\r\nhave taken leave, for that it was supper-time; but she would on no\r\nwise suffer it and making a show of being sore vexed, embraced him and\r\nsaid, 'Ah, woe is me! I see but too clearly how little dear I am to\r\nthee! Who would believe that thou couldst be with a sister of thine,\r\nwhom thou hast never yet seen and in whose house thou shouldst have\r\nlighted down, whenas thou earnest hither, and offer to leave her, to\r\ngo sup at the inn? Indeed, thou shalt sup with me, and albeit my\r\nhusband is abroad, which grieveth me mightily, I shall know well how\r\nto do thee some little honour, such as a woman may.' To which\r\nAndreuccio, unknowing what else he should say, answered, 'I hold you\r\nas dear as a sister should be held; but, an I go not, I shall be\r\nexpected to supper all the evening and shall do an unmannerliness.'\r\n'Praised be God!' cried she. 'One would think I had no one in the\r\nhouse to send to tell them not to expect thee; albeit thou wouldst do\r\nmuch greater courtesy and indeed but thy duty an thou sentest to bid\r\nthy companions come hither to supper; and after, am thou must e'en\r\nbegone, you might all go away together.'\r\n\r\nAndreuccio replied that he had no desire for his companions that\r\nevening; but that, since it was agreeable to her, she might do her\r\npleasure of him. Accordingly, she made a show of sending to the inn to\r\nsay that he was not to be expected to supper, and after much other\r\ndiscourse, they sat down to supper and were sumptuously served with\r\nvarious meats, whilst she adroitly contrived to prolong the repast\r\ntill it was dark night. Then, when they rose from table and Andreuccio\r\nwould have taken his leave, she declared that she would on no wise\r\nsuffer this, for that Naples was no place to go about in by night\r\nespecially for a stranger, and that, whenas she sent to the inn to say\r\nthat he was not to be expected to supper, she had at the same time\r\ngiven notice that he would lie abroad. Andreuccio, believing this and\r\ntaking pleasure in being with her, beguiled as he was by false\r\ncredence, abode where he was, and after supper they held much and long\r\ndiscourse, not without reason,[100] till a part of the night was past,\r\nwhen she withdrew with her women into another room, leaving Andreuccio\r\nin her own chamber, with a little lad to wait upon him, if he should\r\nlack aught.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: The reason was that she wished to keep him in play till\r\nlate into the night, when all the folk should be asleep and she might\r\nthe lightlier deal with him.]\r\n\r\nThe heat being great, Andreuccio, as soon as he found himself alone,\r\nstripped to his doublet and putting off his hosen, laid them at the\r\nbedhead; after which, natural use soliciting him to rid himself of the\r\novermuch burden of his stomach, he asked the boy where this might be\r\ndone, who showed him a door in one corner of the room and said, 'Go in\r\nthere.' Accordingly he opened the door and passing through in all\r\nassurance, chanced to set foot on a plank, which, being broken loose\r\nfrom the joist at the opposite end, [flew up] and down they went,\r\nplank and man together. God so favoured him that he did himself no\r\nhurt in the fall, albeit he fell from some height; but he was all\r\nbemired with the ordure whereof the place was full; and in order that\r\nyou may the better apprehend both that which hath been said and that\r\nwhich ensueth, I will show you how the place lay. There were in a\r\nnarrow alley, such as we often see between two houses, a pair of\r\nrafters laid from one house to another, and thereon sundry boards\r\nnailed and the place of session set up; of which boards that which\r\ngave way with Andreuccio was one.\r\n\r\nFinding himself, then, at the bottom of the alley and sore chagrined\r\nat the mishap, he fell a-bawling for the boy; but the latter, as soon\r\nas he heard him fall, had run to tell his mistress, who hastened to\r\nhis chamber and searching hurriedly if his clothes were there, found\r\nthem and with them the money, which, in his mistrust, he still\r\nfoolishly carried about him. Having now gotten that for which,\r\nfeigning herself of Palermo and sister to a Perugian, she had set her\r\nsnare, she took no more reck of him, but hastened to shut the door\r\nwhereby he had gone out when he fell.\r\n\r\nAndreuccio, getting no answer from the boy, proceeded to call\r\nloudlier, but to no purpose; whereupon, his suspicions being now\r\naroused, he began too late to smoke the cheat. Accordingly, he\r\nscrambled over a low wall that shut off the alley from the street, and\r\nletting himself down into the road, went up to the door of the house,\r\nwhich he knew very well, and there called long and loud and shook and\r\nbeat upon it amain, but all in vain. Wherefore, bewailing himself, as\r\none who was now fully aware of his mischance, 'Ah, woe is me!' cried\r\nhe. 'In how little time have I lost five hundred florins and a\r\nsister!' Then, after many other words, he fell again to battering the\r\ndoor and crying out and this he did so long and so lustily that many\r\nof the neighbours, being awakened and unable to brook the annoy, arose\r\nand one of the courtezan's waiting-women, coming to the window,\r\napparently all sleepy-eyed, said peevishly, 'Who knocketh below\r\nthere?'\r\n\r\n'What?' cried Andreuccio. 'Dost thou not know me? I am Andreuccio,\r\nbrother to Madam Fiordaliso.' Whereto quoth she, 'Good man, an thou\r\nhave drunken overmuch, go sleep and come back to-morrow morning. I\r\nknow no Andreuccio nor what be these idle tales thou tellest. Begone\r\nin peace and let us sleep, so it please thee.' 'How?' replied\r\nAndreuccio. 'Thou knowest not what I mean? Certes, thou knowest; but,\r\nif Sicilian kinships be of such a fashion that they are forgotten in\r\nso short a time, at least give me back my clothes and I will begone\r\nwith all my heart.' 'Good man,' rejoined she, as if laughing,\r\n'methinketh thou dreamest'; and to say this and to draw in her head\r\nand shut the window were one and the same thing. Whereat Andreuccio,\r\nnow fully certified of his loss, was like for chagrin to turn his\r\nexceeding anger into madness and bethought himself to seek to recover\r\nby violence that which he might not have again with words; wherefore,\r\ntaking up a great stone, he began anew to batter the door more\r\nfuriously than ever.\r\n\r\nAt this many of the neighbours, who had already been awakened and had\r\narisen, deeming him some pestilent fellow who had trumped up this\r\nstory to spite the woman of the house and provoked at the knocking he\r\nkept up, came to the windows and began to say, no otherwise than as\r\nall the dogs of a quarter bark after a strange dog, ''Tis a villainous\r\nshame to come at this hour to decent women's houses and tell these\r\ncock-and-bull stories. For God's sake, good man, please you begone in\r\npeace and let us sleep. An thou have aught to mell with her, come back\r\nto-morrow and spare us this annoy to-night.' Taking assurance,\r\nperchance, by these words, there came to the window one who was within\r\nthe house, a bully of the gentlewoman's, whom Andreuccio had as yet\r\nneither heard nor seen, and said, in a terrible big rough voice, 'Who\r\nis below there?'\r\n\r\nAndreuccio, hearing this, raised his eyes and saw at the window one\r\nwho, by what little he could make out, himseemed should be a very\r\nmasterful fellow, with a bushy black beard on his face, and who yawned\r\nand rubbed his eyes, as he had arisen from bed or deep sleep;\r\nwhereupon, not without fear, he answered, 'I am a brother of the lady\r\nof the house.' The other waited not for him to make an end of his\r\nreply, but said, more fiercely than before, 'I know not what hindereth\r\nme from coming down and cudgelling thee what while I see thee stir,\r\nfor a pestilent drunken ass as thou must be, who will not let us sleep\r\nthis night.' Then, drawing back into the house, he shut the window;\r\nwhereupon certain of the neighbours, who were better acquainted with\r\nthe fellow's quality, said softly to Andreuccio, 'For God's sake, good\r\nman, begone in peace and abide not there to-night to be slain; get\r\nthee gone for thine own good.'\r\n\r\nAndreuccio, terrified at the fellow's voice and aspect and moved by\r\nthe exhortations of the neighbours, who seemed to him to speak out of\r\ncharity, set out to return to his inn, in the direction of the quarter\r\nwhence he had followed the maid, without knowing whither to go,\r\ndespairing of his money and woebegone as ever man was. Being loathsome\r\nto himself, for the stench that came from him, and thinking to repair\r\nto the sea to wash himself, he turned to the left and followed a\r\nstreet called Ruga Catalana,[101] that led towards the upper part of\r\nthe city. Presently, he espied two men coming towards him with a\r\nlantern and fearing they might be officers of the watch or other\r\nill-disposed folk, he stealthily took refuge, to avoid them, in a\r\nhovel, that he saw hard by. But they, as of malice aforethought, made\r\nstraight for the same place and entering in, began to examine certain\r\nirons which one of them laid from off his shoulder, discoursing\r\nvarious things thereof the while.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: _i.e._ Catalan Street.]\r\n\r\nPresently, 'What meaneth this?' quoth one. 'I smell the worst stench\r\nmeseemeth I ever smelt.' So saying, he raised the lantern and seeing\r\nthe wretched Andreuccio, enquired, in amazement. 'Who is there?'\r\nAndreuccio made no answer, but they came up to him with the light and\r\nasked him what he did there in such a pickle; whereupon he related to\r\nthem all that had befallen him, and they, conceiving where this might\r\nhave happened, said, one to the other, 'Verily, this must have been\r\nin the house of Scarabone Buttafuocco.' Then, turning to him, 'Good\r\nman,' quoth one, 'albeit thou hast lost thy money, thou hast much\r\nreason to praise God that this mischance betided thee, so that thou\r\nfellest nor couldst after avail to enter the house again; for, hadst\r\nthou not fallen, thou mayst be assured that, when once thou wast\r\nfallen asleep, thou hadst been knocked on the head and hadst lost thy\r\nlife as well as thy money. But what booteth it now to repine? Thou\r\nmayst as well look to have the stars out of the sky as to recover a\r\nfarthing of thy money; nay, thou art like to be murdered, should\r\nyonder fellow hear that thou makest any words thereof.' Then they\r\nconsulted together awhile and presently said to him, 'Look you, we are\r\nmoved to pity for thee; wherefore, an thou wilt join with us in\r\nsomewhat we go about to do, it seemeth to us certain that there will\r\nfall to thee for thy share much more than the value of that which thou\r\nhast lost.' Whereupon Andreuccio, in his desperation, answered that he\r\nwas ready.\r\n\r\nNow there had been that day buried an archbishop of Naples, by name\r\nMesser Filippo Minutolo, and he had been interred in his richest\r\nornaments and with a ruby on his finger worth more than five hundred\r\nflorins of gold. Him they were minded to despoil and this their intent\r\nthey discovered to Andreuccio, who, more covetous than well-advised,\r\nset out with them for the cathedral. As they went, Andreuccio still\r\nstinking amain, one of the thieves said, 'Can we not find means for\r\nthis fellow to wash himself a little, be it where it may, so he may\r\nnot stink so terribly?' 'Ay can we,' answered the other. 'We are here\r\nnear a well, where there useth to be a rope and pulley and a great\r\nbucket; let us go thither and we will wash him in a trice.'\r\nAccordingly they made for the well in question and found the rope\r\nthere, but the bucket had been taken away; wherefore they took counsel\r\ntogether to tie him to the rope and let him down into the well, so he\r\nmight wash himself there, charging him shake the rope as soon as he\r\nwas clean, and they would pull him up.\r\n\r\nHardly had they let him down when, as chance would have it, certain of\r\nthe watch, being athirst for the heat and with running after some\r\nrogue or another, came to the well to drink, and the two rogues,\r\nsetting eyes on them, made off incontinent, before the officers saw\r\nthem. Presently, Andreuccio, having washed himself at the bottom of\r\nthe well, shook the rope, and the thirsty officers, laying by their\r\ntargets and arms and surcoats, began to haul upon the rope, thinking\r\nthe bucket full of water at the other end. As soon as Andreuccio found\r\nhimself near the top, he let go the rope and laid hold of the marge\r\nwith both hands; which when the officers saw, overcome with sudden\r\naffright, they dropped the rope, without saying a word, and took to\r\ntheir heels as quickliest they might. At this Andreuccio marvelled\r\nsore, and but that he had fast hold of the marge, would have fallen to\r\nthe bottom, to his no little hurt or maybe death. However, he made his\r\nway out and finding the arms, which he knew were none of his\r\ncompanions' bringing, he was yet more amazed; but, knowing not what to\r\nmake of it and misdoubting [some snare], he determined to begone\r\nwithout touching aught and accordingly made off he knew not whither,\r\nbewailing his ill-luck.\r\n\r\nAs he went, he met his two comrades, who came to draw him forth of the\r\nwell; and when they saw him, they marvelled exceedingly and asked him\r\nwho had drawn him up. Andreuccio replied that he knew not and told\r\nthem orderly how it had happened and what he had found by the\r\nwellside, whereupon the others, perceiving how the case stood, told\r\nhim, laughing, why they had fled and who these were that had pulled\r\nhim up. Then, without farther parley, it being now middle night, they\r\nrepaired to the cathedral and making their way thereinto lightly\r\nenough, went straight to the archbishop's tomb, which was of marble\r\nand very large. With their irons they raised the lid, which was very\r\nheavy, and propped it up so as a man might enter; which being done,\r\nquoth one, 'Who shall go in?' 'Not I,' answered the other. 'Nor I,'\r\nrejoined his fellow; 'let Andreuccio enter.' 'That will I not,' said\r\nthe latter; whereupon the two rogues turned upon him and said, 'How!\r\nThou wilt not? Cock's faith, an thou enter not, we will clout thee\r\nover the costard with one of these iron bars till thou fall dead.'\r\n\r\nAndreuccio, affrighted, crept into the tomb, saying in himself the\r\nwhile, 'These fellows will have me go in here so they may cheat me,\r\nfor that, when I shall have given them everything, they will begone\r\nabout their business, whilst I am labouring to win out of the tomb,\r\nand I shall abide empty-handed.' Accordingly, he determined to make\r\nsure of his share beforehand; wherefore, as soon as he came to the\r\nbottom, calling to mind the precious ring whereof he had heard them\r\nspeak, he drew it from the archbishop's finger and set it on his own.\r\nThen he passed them the crozier and mitre and gloves and stripping the\r\ndead man to his shirt, gave them everything, saying that there was\r\nnothing more. The others declared that the ring must be there and bade\r\nhim seek everywhere; but he replied that he found it not and making a\r\nshow of seeking it, kept them in play awhile. At last, the two rogues,\r\nwho were no less wily than himself, bidding him seek well the while,\r\ntook occasion to pull away the prop that held up the lid and made off,\r\nleaving him shut in the tomb.\r\n\r\nWhat became of Andreuccio, when he found himself in this plight, you\r\nmay all imagine for yourselves. He strove again and again to heave up\r\nthe lid with his head and shoulders, but only wearied himself in vain;\r\nwherefore, overcome with chagrin and despair, he fell down in a swoon\r\nupon the archbishop's dead body; and whoso saw him there had hardly\r\nknown which was the deader, the prelate or he. Presently, coming to\r\nhimself, he fell into a passion of weeping, seeing he must there\r\nwithout fail come to one of two ends, to wit, either he must, if none\r\ncame thither to open the tomb again, die of hunger and stench, among\r\nthe worms of the dead body, or, if any came and found him there, he\r\nwould certainly be hanged for a thief.\r\n\r\nAs he abode in this mind, exceeding woebegone, he heard folk stirring\r\nin the Church and many persons speaking and presently perceived that\r\nthey came to do that which he and his comrades had already done;\r\nwhereat fear redoubled upon him. But, after the newcomers had forced\r\nopen the tomb and propped up the lid, they fell into dispute of who\r\nshould go in, and none was willing to do it. However, after long\r\nparley, a priest said, 'What fear ye? Think you he will eat you? The\r\ndead eat not men. I will go in myself.' So saying, he set his breast\r\nto the marge of the tomb and turning his head outward, put in his\r\nlegs, thinking to let himself drop. Andreuccio, seeing this, started\r\nup and catching the priest by one of his legs, made a show of offering\r\nto pull him down into the tomb. The other, feeling this, gave a\r\nterrible screech and flung precipitately out of the tomb; whereupon\r\nall the others fled in terror, as they were pursued by an hundred\r\nthousand devils, leaving the tomb open.\r\n\r\nAndreuccio, seeing this, scrambled hastily out of the tomb, rejoiced\r\nbeyond all hope, and made off out of the church by the way he had\r\nentered in. The day now drawing near, he fared on at a venture, with\r\nthe ring on his finger, till he came to the sea-shore and thence made\r\nhis way back to his inn, where he found his comrades and the host, who\r\nhad been in concern for him all that night. He told them what had\r\nbetided him and themseemed, by the host's counsel, that he were best\r\ndepart Naples incontinent. Accordingly, he set out forthright and\r\nreturned to Perugia, having invested his money in a ring, whereas he\r\ncame to buy horses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Second]\r\n\r\n     MADAM BERITOLA, HAVING LOST HER TWO SONS, IS FOUND ON A\r\n     DESERT ISLAND WITH TWO KIDS AND GOETH THENCE INTO LUNIGIANA,\r\n     WHERE ONE OF HER SONS, TAKING SERVICE WITH THE LORD OF THE\r\n     COUNTRY, LIETH WITH HIS DAUGHTER AND IS CAST INTO PRISON.\r\n     SICILY AFTER REBELLING AGAINST KING CHARLES AND THE YOUTH\r\n     BEING RECOGNIZED BY HIS MOTHER, HE ESPOUSETH HIS LORD'S\r\n     DAUGHTER, AND HIS BROTHER BEING LIKEWISE FOUND, THEY ARE ALL\r\n     THREE RESTORED TO HIGH ESTATE\r\n\r\n\r\nLadies and young men alike laughed heartily at Andreuccio's\r\nadventures, as related by Fiammetta, and Emilia, seeing the story\r\nended, began, by the queen's commandment, to speak thus: \"Grievous\r\nthings and woeful are the various shifts of Fortune, whereof,--for\r\nthat, whenassoever it is discoursed of them, it is an awakenment for\r\nour minds, which lightly fall asleep under her blandishments,--methinketh\r\nit should never be irksome either to the happy or the unhappy to hear\r\ntell, inasmuch as it rendereth the former wary and consoleth the\r\nlatter. Wherefore, albeit great things have already been recounted\r\nupon this subject, I purpose to tell you thereanent a story no less\r\ntrue than pitiful, whereof, for all it had a joyful ending, so great\r\nand so longsome was the bitterness that I can scarce believe it to\r\nhave been assuaged by any subsequent gladness.\r\n\r\nYou must know, dearest ladies, that, after the death of the Emperor\r\nFrederick the Second, Manfred was crowned King of Sicily, in very high\r\nestate with whom was a gentleman of Naples called Arrighetto Capece,\r\nwho had to wife a fair and noble lady, also of Naples, by name Madam\r\nBeritola Caracciola. The said Arrighetto, who had the governance of\r\nthe island in his hands, hearing that King Charles the First[102] had\r\novercome and slain Manfred at Benevento and that all the realm had\r\nrevolted to him and having scant assurance of the short-lived fidelity\r\nof the Sicilians, prepared for flight, misliking to become a subject\r\nof his lord's enemy; but, his intent being known of the Sicilians, he\r\nand many other friends and servants of King Manfred were suddenly made\r\nprisoners and delivered to King Charles, together with possession of\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: Charles d'Anjou.]\r\n\r\nMadam Beritola, in this grievous change of affairs, knowing not what\r\nwas come of Arrighetto and sore adread of that which had befallen,\r\nabandoned all her possessions for fear of shame and poor and pregnant\r\nas she was, embarked, with a son of hers and maybe eight years of age,\r\nGiusfredi by name, in a little boat and fled to Lipari, where she gave\r\nbirth to another male child, whom she named Scacciato,[103] and\r\ngetting her a nurse, took ship with all three to return to her\r\nkinsfolk at Naples. But it befell otherwise than as she purposed; for\r\nthat the ship, which should have gone to Naples, was carried by stress\r\nof wind to the island of Ponza,[104] where they entered a little bight\r\nof the sea and there awaited an occasion for continuing their voyage.\r\nMadam Beritola, going up, like the rest, into the island and finding a\r\nremote and solitary place, addressed herself to make moan for her\r\nArrighetto, all alone there.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: _i.e._ the Banished or the Expelled One.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: An island in the Gulf of Gaeta, about 70 miles from\r\nNaples. It is now inhabited, but appears in Boccaccio's time to have\r\nbeen desert.]\r\n\r\nThis being her daily usance, it chanced one day that, as she was\r\noccupied in bewailing herself, there came up a pirate galley,\r\nunobserved of any, sailor or other, and taking them all at unawares,\r\nmade off with her prize. Madam Beritola, having made an end of her\r\ndiurnal lamentation, returned to the sea-shore, as she was used to do,\r\nto visit her children, but found none there; whereat she first\r\nmarvelled and after, suddenly misdoubting her of that which had\r\nhappened, cast her eyes out to sea and saw the galley at no great\r\ndistance, towing the little ship after it; whereby she knew but too\r\nwell that she had lost her children, as well as her husband, and\r\nseeing herself there poor and desolate and forsaken, unknowing where\r\nshe should ever again find any of them, she fell down aswoon upon the\r\nstrand, calling upon her husband and her children. There was none\r\nthere to recall her distracted spirits with cold water or other\r\nremedy, wherefore they might at their leisure go wandering whither it\r\npleased them; but, after awhile, the lost senses returning to her\r\nwretched body, in company with tears and lamentations, she called long\r\nupon her children and went a great while seeking them in every cavern.\r\nAt last, finding all her labour in vain and seeing the night coming\r\non, she began, hoping and knowing not what, to be careful for herself\r\nand departing the sea-shore, returned to the cavern where she was wont\r\nto weep and bemoan herself.\r\n\r\nShe passed the night in great fear and inexpressible dolour and the\r\nnew day being come and the hour of tierce past, she was fain,\r\nconstrained by hunger, for that she had not supped overnight, to\r\nbrowse upon herbs; and having fed as best she might, she gave herself,\r\nweeping, to various thoughts of her future life. Pondering thus, she\r\nsaw a she-goat enter a cavern hard by and presently issue thence and\r\nbetake herself into the wood; whereupon she arose and entering whereas\r\nthe goat had come forth, found there two little kidlings, born belike\r\nthat same day, which seemed to her the quaintest and prettiest things\r\nin the world. Her milk being yet undried from her recent delivery, she\r\ntenderly took up the kids and set them to her breast. They refused not\r\nthe service, but sucked her as if she had been their dam and\r\nthenceforth made no distinction between the one and the other.\r\nWherefore, herseeming she had found some company in that desert place,\r\nand growing no less familiar with the old goat than with her little\r\nones, she resigned herself to live and die there and abode eating of\r\nherbs and drinking water and weeping as often as she remembered her of\r\nher husband and children and of her past life.\r\n\r\nThe gentle lady, thus grown a wild creature, abiding on this wise, it\r\nbefell, after some months, that there came on like wise to the place\r\nwhither she had aforetime been driven by stress of weather, a little\r\nvessel from Pisa and there abode some days. On broad this bark was a\r\ngentleman named Currado [of the family] of the Marquises of Malespina,\r\nwho, with his wife, a lady of worth and piety, was on his return home\r\nfrom a pilgrimage to all the holy places that be in the kingdom of\r\nApulia. To pass away the time, Currado set out one day, with his lady\r\nand certain of his servants and his dogs, to go about the island, and\r\nnot far from Madam Beritola's place of harbourage, the dogs started\r\nthe two kids, which were now grown pretty big, as they went grazing.\r\nThe latter, chased by the dogs, fled to no other place but into the\r\ncavern where was Madam Beritola, who, seeing this, started to her feet\r\nand catching up a staff, beat off the dogs. Currado and his wife, who\r\ncame after them, seeing the lady, who was grown swart and lean and\r\nhairy, marvelled, and she yet more at them. But after Currado had, at\r\nher instance, called off his dogs, they prevailed with her, by dint of\r\nmuch entreaty, to tell them who she was and what she did there;\r\nwhereupon she fully discovered to them her whole condition and all\r\nthat had befallen her, together with her firm resolution [to abide\r\nalone in the island].\r\n\r\nCurrado, who had know Arrighetto Capece very well, hearing this, wept\r\nfor pity, and did his utmost to divert her with words from so\r\nbarbarous a purpose, offering to carry her back to her own house or to\r\nkeep her with himself, holding her in such honour as his sister, until\r\nGod should send her happier fortune. The lady not yielding to these\r\nproffers, Currado left his wife with her, bidding the latter cause\r\nbring thither to eat and clothe the lady, who was all in rags, with\r\nsome of her own apparel, and charging her contrive, by whatsoever\r\nmeans, to bring her away with her. Accordingly, the gentle lady, being\r\nleft with Madam Beritola, after condoling with her amain of her\r\nmisfortunes, sent for raiment and victual and prevailed on her, with\r\nall the pains in the world, to don the one and eat the other.\r\n\r\nUltimately, after many prayers, Madam Beritola protesting that she\r\nwould never consent to go whereas she might be known, she persuaded\r\nher to go with her into Lunigiana, together with the two kids and\r\ntheir dam, which latter were meantime returned and had greeted her\r\nwith the utmost fondness, to the no small wonderment of the\r\ngentlewoman. Accordingly, as soon as fair weather was come, Madam\r\nBeritola embarked with Currado and his lady in their vessel, carrying\r\nwith her the two kids and the she-goat (on whose account, her name\r\nbeing everywhere unknown, she was styled Cavriuola[105]) and setting\r\nsail with a fair wind, came speedily to the mouth of the Magra,[106]\r\nwhere they landed and went up to Currado's castle. There Madam\r\nBeritola abode, in a widow's habit, about the person of Currado's\r\nlady, as one of her waiting-women, humble, modest and obedient, still\r\ncherishing her kids and letting nourish them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: _i.e._ wild she-goat.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: A river falling into the Gulf of Genoa between Carrara\r\nand Spezzia.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the corsairs, who had taken the ship wherein Madam Beritola\r\ncame to Ponza, but had left herself, as being unseen of them, betook\r\nthemselves with all the other folk to Genoa, where, the booty coming\r\nto be shared among the owners of the galley, it chanced that the nurse\r\nand the two children fell, amongst other things, to the lot of a\r\ncertain Messer Guasparrino d'Oria,[107] who sent them all three to his\r\nmansion, to be there employed as slaves about the service of the\r\nhouse. The nurse, afflicted beyond measure at the loss of her mistress\r\nand at the wretched condition where into she found herself and the two\r\nchildren fallen, wept long and sore; but, for that, albeit a poor\r\nwoman, she was discreet and well-advised, when she saw that tears\r\navailed nothing and that she was become a slave together with them,\r\nshe first comforted herself as best she might and after, considering\r\nwhither they were come, she bethought herself that, should the two\r\nchildren be known, they might lightly chance to suffer hindrance;\r\nwherefore, hoping withal that, sooner or later fortune might change\r\nand they, an they lived, regain their lost estate, she resolved to\r\ndiscover to no one who they were, until she should see occasion\r\ntherefor, and told all who asked her thereof that they were her sons.\r\nThe elder she named, not Giusfredi, but Giannotto di Procida (the name\r\nof the younger she cared not to change), and explained to him, with\r\nthe utmost diligence, why she had changed his name, showing him in\r\nwhat peril he might be, an he were known. This she set out to him not\r\nonce, but many and many a time, and the boy, who was quick of wit,\r\npunctually obeyed the enjoinment of his discreet nurse.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: More familiar to modern ears as Doria.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the two boys and their nurse abode patiently in Messer\r\nGuasparrino's house several years, ill-clad and worse shod and\r\nemployed about the meanest offices. But Giannotto, who was now sixteen\r\nyears of age, and had more spirit than pertained to a slave, scorning\r\nthe baseness of a menial condition, embarked on board certain galleys\r\nbound for Alexandria and taking leave of Messer Guasparrino's service,\r\njourneyed to divers parts, without any wise availing to advance\r\nhimself. At last some three or four years after his departure from\r\nGenoa, being grown a handsome youth and tall of his person and hearing\r\nthat his father, whom he thought dead, was yet alive, but was kept by\r\nKing Charles in prison and duresse, he went wandering at a venture,\r\nwell nigh despairing of fortune, till he came to Lunigiana and there,\r\nas chance would have it, took service with Currado Malespina, whom he\r\nserved with great aptitude and acceptance. And albeit he now and again\r\nsaw his mother, who was with Currado's lady, he never recognized her\r\nnor she him, so much had time changed the one and the other from that\r\nwhich they were used to be, whenas they last set eyes on each other.\r\n\r\nGiannotto being, then, in Currado's service, it befell that a daughter\r\nof the latter, by name Spina, being left the widow of one Niccolo da\r\nGrignano, returned to her father's house and being very fair and\r\nagreeable and a girl of little more than sixteen years of age, chanced\r\nto cast eyes on Giannotto and he on her, and they became passionately\r\nenamoured of each other. Their love was not long without effect and\r\nlasted several months ere any was ware thereof. Wherefore, taking\r\novermuch assurance, they began to order themselves with less\r\ndiscretion than behoveth unto matters of this kind, and one day, as\r\nthey went, the young lady and Giannotto together, through a fair and\r\nthickset wood, they pushed on among the trees, leaving the rest of the\r\ncompany behind. Presently, themseeming they had far foregone the\r\nothers, they laid themselves down to rest in a pleasant place, full of\r\ngrass and flowers and shut in with trees, and there fell to taking\r\namorous delight one of the other.\r\n\r\nIn this occupation, the greatness of their delight making the time\r\nseem brief to them, albeit they had been there a great while, they\r\nwere surprised, first by the girl's mother and after by Currado, who,\r\nchagrined beyond measure at this sight, without saying aught of the\r\ncause, had them both seized by three of his serving-men and carried in\r\nbonds to a castle of his and went off, boiling with rage and despite\r\nand resolved to put them both to a shameful death. The girl's mother,\r\nalthough sore incensed and holding her daughter worthy of the severest\r\npunishment for her default, having by certain words of Currado\r\napprehended his intent towards the culprits and unable to brook this,\r\nhastened after her enraged husband and began to beseech him that it\r\nwould please him not run madly to make himself in his old age the\r\nmurderer of his own daughter and to soil his hands with the blood of\r\none of his servants, but to find other means of satisfying his wrath,\r\nsuch as to clap them in prison and there let them pine and bewail the\r\nfault committed. With these and many other words the pious lady so\r\nwrought upon him that she turned his mind from putting them to death\r\nand he bade imprison them, each in a place apart, where they should be\r\nwell guarded and kept with scant victual and much unease, till such\r\ntime as he should determine farther of them. As he bade, so was it\r\ndone, and what their life was in duresse and continual tears and in\r\nfasts longer than might have behoved unto them, each may picture to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nWhat while Giannotto and Spina abode in this doleful case and had\r\ntherein already abidden a year's space, unremembered of Currado, it\r\ncame to pass that King Pedro of Arragon, by the procurement of Messer\r\nGian di Procida, raised the island of Sicily against King Charles and\r\ntook it from him, whereat Currado, being a Ghibelline,[108] rejoiced\r\nexceedingly, Giannotto, hearing of this from one of those who had him\r\nin guard, heaved a great sigh and said, 'Ah, woe is me! These fourteen\r\nyears have I gone ranging beggarlike about the world, looking for\r\nnought other than this, which, now that it is come, so I may never\r\nagain hope for weal, hath found me in a prison whence I have no hope\r\never to come forth, save dead.' 'How so?' asked the gaoler. 'What doth\r\nthat concern thee which great kings do to one another? What hast thou\r\nto do in Sicily?' Quoth Giannotto, 'My heart is like to burst when I\r\nremember me of that which my father erst had to do there, whom, albeit\r\nI was but a little child, when I fled thence, yet do I mind me to have\r\nbeen lord thereof, in the lifetime of King Manfred.' 'And who was thy\r\nfather?' asked the gaoler. 'My father's name,' answered Giannotto, 'I\r\nmay now safely make known, since I find myself in the peril whereof I\r\nwas in fear, an I discovered it. He was and is yet, an he live, called\r\nArrighetto Capece, and my name is, not Giannotto, but Giusfredi, and I\r\ndoubt not a jot, an I were quit of this prison, but I might yet, by\r\nreturning to Sicily, have very high place there.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: The Ghibellines were the supporters of the Papal\r\nfaction against the Guelphs or adherents of the Emperor Frederick II.\r\nof Germany. The cardinal struggle between the two factions took place\r\nover the succession to the throne of Naples and Sicily, to which the\r\nPope appointed Charles of Anjou, who overcame and killed the reigning\r\nsovereign Manfred, but was himself, through the machinations of the\r\nGhibellines, expelled from Sicily by the celebrated popular rising\r\nknown as the Sicilian Vespers.]\r\n\r\nThe honest man, without asking farther, reported Giannotto's words, as\r\nfirst he had occasion, to Currado, who, hearing this,--albeit he\r\nfeigned to the gaoler to make light of it,--betook himself to Madam\r\nBeritola and courteously asked her if she had had by Arrighetto a son\r\nnamed Giusfredi. The lady answered, weeping, that, if the elder of her\r\ntwo sons were alive, he would so be called and would be two-and-twenty\r\nyears old. Currado, hearing this, concluded that this must be he and\r\nbethought himself that, were it so, he might at once do a great mercy\r\nand take away his own and his daughter's shame by giving her to\r\nGiannotto to wife; wherefore, sending privily for the latter, he\r\nparticularly examined him touching all his past life and finding, by\r\nvery manifest tokens, that he was indeed Giusfredi, son of Arrighetto\r\nCapece, he said to him, 'Giannotto, thou knowest what and how great is\r\nthe wrong thou hast done me in the person of my daughter, whereas, I\r\nhaving ever well and friendly entreated thee, it behoved thee, as a\r\nservant should, still to study and do for my honour and interest; and\r\nmany there be who, hadst thou used them like as thou hast used me,\r\nwould have put thee to a shameful death, the which my clemency brooked\r\nnot. Now, if it be as thou tellest me, to wit, that thou art the son\r\nof a man of condition and of a noble lady, I purpose, an thou thyself\r\nbe willing, to put an end to thy tribulations and relieving thee from\r\nthe misery and duresse wherein thou abidest, to reinstate at once\r\nthine honour and mine own in their due stead. As thou knowest, Spina,\r\nwhom thou hast, though after a fashion misbeseeming both thyself and\r\nher, taken with love-liking, is a widow and her dowry is both great\r\nand good; as for her manners and her father and mother, thou knowest\r\nthem, and of thy present state I say nothing. Wherefore, an thou will,\r\nI purpose that, whereas she hath unlawfully been thy mistress, she\r\nshall now lawfully become thy wife and that thou shalt abide here with\r\nme and with her, as my very son, so long as it shall please thee.'\r\n\r\nNow prison had mortified Giannotto's flesh, but had nothing abated the\r\ngenerous spirit, which he derived from his noble birth, nor yet the\r\nentire affection he bore his mistress; and albeit he ardently desired\r\nthat which Currado proffered him and saw himself in the latter's\r\npower, yet no whit did he dissemble of that which the greatness of his\r\nsoul prompted him to say; wherefore he answered, 'Currado, neither\r\nlust of lordship nor greed of gain nor other cause whatever hath ever\r\nmade me lay snares, traitor-wise, for thy life or thy good. I loved\r\nand love thy daughter and still shall love her, for that I hold her\r\nworthy of my love, and if I dealt with her less than honourably, in\r\nthe opinion of the vulgar, my sin was one which still goeth hand in\r\nhand with youth and which an you would do away, it behoveth you first\r\ndo away with youth. Moreover, it is an offence which, would the old\r\nbut remember them of having been young and measure the defaults of\r\nothers by their own and their own by those of others, would show less\r\ngrievous than thou and many others make it; and as a friend, and not\r\nas an enemy, I committed it. This that thou profferest me I have still\r\ndesired and had I thought it should be vouchsafed me, I had long since\r\nsought it; and so much the dearer will it now be to me, as my hope\r\nthereof was less. If, then, thou have not that intent which thy words\r\ndenote, feed me not with vain hope; but restore me to prison and there\r\ntorment me as thou wilt, for, so long as I love Spina, even so, for\r\nthe love of her, shall I still love thee, whatsoever thou dost with\r\nme, and have thee in reverence.'\r\n\r\nCurrado, hearing this, marvelled and held him great of soul and his\r\nlove fervent and tendered him therefore the dearer; wherefore, rising\r\nto his feet, he embraced him and kissed him and without more delay\r\nbade privily bring Spina thither. Accordingly, the lady--who was grown\r\nlean and pale and weakly in prison and showed well nigh another than\r\nshe was wont to be, as on like wise Giannotto another man--being come,\r\nthe two lovers in Currado's presence with one consent contracted\r\nmarriage according to our usance. Then, after some days, during which\r\nhe had let furnish the newly-married pair with all that was necessary\r\nor agreeable to them, he deemed it time to gladden their mothers with\r\nthe good news and accordingly calling his lady and Cavriuola, he said\r\nto the latter, 'What would you say, madam, an I should cause you have\r\nagain your elder son as the husband of one of my daughters?' Whereto\r\nshe answered, 'Of that I can say to you no otherwhat than that, could\r\nI be more beholden to you than I am, I should be so much the more so\r\nas you would have restored to me that which is dearer to me than mine\r\nown self; and restoring it to me on such wise as you say, you would in\r\nsome measure re-awaken in me my lost hope.' With this, she held her\r\npeace, weeping, and Currado said to his lady, 'And thou, mistress, how\r\nwouldst thou take it, were I to present thee with such a son-in-law?'\r\nThe lady replied, 'Even a common churl, so he pleased you, would\r\nplease me, let alone one of these,[109] who are men of gentle birth.'\r\n'Then,' said Currado, 'I hope, ere many days, to make you happy women\r\nin this.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: _i.e._ Beritola's sons.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, seeing the two young folk now restored to their former\r\ncheer, he clad them sumptuously and said to Giusfredi, 'Were it not\r\ndear to thee, over and above thy present joyance, an thou sawest thy\r\nmother here?' Whereto he answered, 'I dare not flatter myself that the\r\nchagrin of her unhappy chances can have left her so long alive; but,\r\nwere it indeed so, it were dear to me above all, more by token that\r\nmethinketh I might yet, by her counsel, avail to recover great part of\r\nmy estate in Sicily.' Thereupon Currado sent for both the ladies, who\r\ncame and made much of the newly-wedded wife, no little wondering what\r\nhappy inspiration it could have been that prompted Currado to such\r\nexceeding complaisance as he had shown in joining Giannotto with her\r\nin marriage. Madam Beritola, by reason of the words she had heard from\r\nCurrado, began to consider Giannotto and some remembrance of the\r\nboyish lineaments of her son's countenance being by occult virtue\r\nawakened in her, without awaiting farther explanation, she ran,\r\nopen-armed, to cast herself upon his neck, nor did overabounding\r\nemotion and maternal joy suffer her to say a word; nay, they so locked\r\nup all her senses that she fell into her son's arms, as if dead.\r\n\r\nThe latter, albeit he was sore amazed, remembering to have many times\r\nbefore seen her in that same castle and never recognized her,\r\nnevertheless knew incontinent the maternal odour and blaming himself\r\nfor his past heedlessness, received her, weeping, in his arms and\r\nkissed her tenderly. After awhile, Madam Beritola, being\r\naffectionately tended by Currado's lady and Spina and plied both with\r\ncold water and other remedies, recalled her strayed senses and\r\nembracing her son anew, full of maternal tenderness, with many tears\r\nand many tender words, kissed him a thousand times, whilst he all\r\nreverently beheld and entreated her. After these joyful and honourable\r\ngreetings had been thrice or four times repeated, to the no small\r\ncontentment of the bystanders, and they had related unto each other\r\nall that had befallen them, Currado now, to the exceeding satisfaction\r\nof all, signified to his friends the new alliance made by him and gave\r\nordinance for a goodly and magnificent entertainment.\r\n\r\nThen said Giusfredi to him, 'Currado, you have made me glad of many\r\nthings and have long honourably entertained my mother; and now, that\r\nno whit may remain undone of that which it is in your power to do, I\r\npray you gladden my mother and bride-feast and myself with the\r\npresence of my brother, whom Messer Guasparrino d'Oria holdeth in\r\nservitude in his house and whom, as I have already told you, he took\r\nwith me in one of his cruises. Moreover, I would have you send into\r\nSicily one who shall thoroughly inform himself of the state and\r\ncondition of the country and study to learn what is come of\r\nArrighetto, my father, an he be alive or dead, and if he be alive, in\r\nwhat estate; of all which having fully certified himself, let him\r\nreturn to us.' Giusfredi's request was pleasing to Currado, and\r\nwithout any delay he despatched very discreet persons both to Genoa\r\nand to Sicily.\r\n\r\nHe who went to Genoa there sought out Messer Guasparrino and instantly\r\nbesought him, on Currado's part, to send him Scacciato and his nurse,\r\norderly recounting to him all his lord's dealings with Giusfredi and\r\nhis mother. Messer Guasparrino marvelled exceedingly to hear this and\r\nsaid, 'True is it I would do all I may to pleasure Currado, and I\r\nhave, indeed, these fourteen years had in my house the boy thou\r\nseekest and one his mother, both of whom I will gladly send him; but\r\ndo thou bid him, on my part, beware of lending overmuch credence to\r\nthe fables of Giannotto, who nowadays styleth himself Giusfredi, for\r\nthat he is a far greater knave than he deemeth.' So saying, he caused\r\nhonourably entertain the gentleman and sending privily for the nurse,\r\nquestioned her shrewdly touching the matter. Now she had heard of the\r\nSicilian revolt and understood Arrighetto to be alive, wherefore,\r\ncasting off her former fears, she told him everything in order and\r\nshowed him the reasons that had moved her to do as she had done.\r\n\r\nMesser Guasparrino, finding her tale to accord perfectly with that of\r\nCurrado's messenger, began to give credit to the latter's words and\r\nhaving by one means and another, like a very astute man as he was,\r\nmade enquiry of the matter and happening hourly upon things that gave\r\nhim more and more assurance of the fact, took shame to himself of his\r\nmean usage of the lad, in amends whereof, knowing what Arrighetto had\r\nbeen and was, he gave him to wife a fair young daughter of his, eleven\r\nyears of age, with a great dowry. Then, after making a great\r\nbride-feast thereon, he embarked with the boy and girl and Currado's\r\nmessenger and the nurse in a well-armed galliot and betook himself to\r\nLerici, where he was received by Currado and went up, with all his\r\ncompany, to one of the latter's castles, not far removed thence, where\r\nthere was a great banquet toward.\r\n\r\nThe mother's joy at seeing her son again and that of the two brothers\r\nin each other and of all three in the faithful nurse, the honour done\r\nof all to Messer Guasparrino and his daughter and of him to all and\r\nthe rejoicing of all together with Currado and his lady and children\r\nand friends, no words might avail to express; wherefore, ladies, I\r\nleave it to you to imagine. Thereunto,[110] that it might be complete,\r\nit pleased God the Most High, a most abundant giver, whenas He\r\nbeginneth, to add the glad news of the life and well-being of\r\nArrighetto Capece; for that, the feast being at its height and the\r\nguests, both ladies and men, yet at table for the first service, there\r\ncame he who had been sent into Sicily and amongst other things,\r\nreported of Arrighetto that he, being kept in captivity by King\r\nCharles, whenas the revolt against the latter broke out in the land,\r\nthe folk ran in a fury to the prison and slaying his guards, delivered\r\nhimself and as a capital enemy of King Charles, made him their captain\r\nand followed him to expel and slay the French: wherefore he was become\r\nin especial favour with King Pedro,[111] who had reinstated him in all\r\nhis honours and possessions, and was now in great good case. The\r\nmessenger added that he had received himself with the utmost honour\r\nand had rejoiced with inexpressible joy in the recovery of his wife\r\nand son, of whom he had heard nothing since his capture; moreover, he\r\nhad sent a brigantine for them, with divers gentlemen aboard, who came\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: _i.e._ to which general joy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: Pedro of Arragon, son-in-law of Manfred, who, in\r\nconsequence of the Sicilian Vespers, succeeded Charles d'Anjou as King\r\nof Sicily.]\r\n\r\nThe messenger was received and hearkened with great gladness and\r\nrejoicing, whilst Currado, with certain of his friends, set out\r\nincontinent to meet the gentlemen who came for Madam Beritola and\r\nGiusfredi and welcoming them joyously, introduced them into his\r\nbanquet, which was not yet half ended. There both the lady and\r\nGiusfredi, no less than all the others, beheld them with such joyance\r\nthat never was heard the like; and the gentlemen, ere they sat down to\r\nmeat, saluted Currado and his lady on the part of Arrighetto, thanking\r\nthem, as best they knew and might, for the honour done both to his\r\nwife and his son and offering himself to their pleasure,[112] in all\r\nthat lay in his power. Then, turning to Messer Guasparrino, whose\r\nkindness was unlooked for, they avouched themselves most certain that,\r\nwhenas that which he had done for Scacciato should be known of\r\nArrighetto, the like thanks and yet greater would be rendered him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: Or (in modern phrase) putting himself at their\r\ndisposition.]\r\n\r\nThereafter they banqueted right joyously with the new-made bridegrooms\r\nat the bride-feast of the two newly-wedded wives; nor that day alone\r\ndid Currado entertain his son-in-law and other his kinsmen and\r\nfriends, but many others. As soon as the rejoicings were somewhat\r\nabated, it appearing to Madam Beritola and to Giusfredi and the others\r\nthat it was time to depart, they took leave with many tears of Currado\r\nand his lady and Messer Guasparrino and embarked on board the\r\nbrigantine, carrying Spina with them; then, setting sail with a fair\r\nwind, they came speedily to Sicily, where all alike, both sons and\r\ndaughters-in-law, were received by Arrighetto in Palermo with such\r\nrejoicing as might never be told; and there it is believed that they\r\nall lived happily a great while after, in love and thankfulness to God\r\nthe Most High, as mindful of the benefits received.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Second]\r\n\r\n     THE SOLDAN OF BABYLON SENDETH A DAUGHTER OF HIS TO BE\r\n     MARRIED TO THE KING OF ALGARVE, AND SHE, BY DIVERS CHANCES,\r\n     IN THE SPACE OF FOUR YEARS COMETH TO THE HANDS OF NINE MEN\r\n     IN VARIOUS PLACES. ULTIMATELY, BEING RESTORED TO HER FATHER\r\n     FOR A MAID, SHE GOETH TO THE KING OF ALGARVE TO WIFE, AS\r\n     FIRST SHE DID\r\n\r\n\r\nHad Emilia's story been much longer protracted, it is like the\r\ncompassion had by the young ladies on the misfortunes of Madam\r\nBeritola would have brought them to tears; but, an end being now made\r\nthereof, it pleased the queen that Pamfilo should follow on with his\r\nstory, and accordingly he, who was very obedient, began thus, \"Uneath,\r\ncharming ladies, is it for us to know that which is meet for us, for\r\nthat, as may oftentimes have been seen, many, imagining that, were\r\nthey but rich, they might avail to live without care and secure, have\r\nnot only with prayers sought riches of God, but have diligently\r\nstudied to acquire them, grudging no toil and no peril in the quest,\r\nand who,--whereas, before they became enriched, they loved their\r\nlives,--once having gotten their desire, have found folk to slay them,\r\nfor greed of so ample an inheritance. Others of low estate, having,\r\nthrough a thousand perilous battles and the blood of their brethren\r\nand their friends, mounted to the summit of kingdoms, thinking in the\r\nroyal estate to enjoy supreme felicity, without the innumerable cares\r\nand alarms whereof they see and feel it full, have learned, at the\r\ncost of their lives, that poison is drunken at royal tables in cups of\r\ngold. Many there be who have with most ardent appetite desired bodily\r\nstrength and beauty and divers personal adornments and perceived not\r\nthat they had desired ill till they found these very gifts a cause to\r\nthem of death or dolorous life. In fine, not to speak particularly of\r\nall the objects of human desire, I dare say that there is not one\r\nwhich can, with entire assurance, be chosen by mortal men as secure\r\nfrom the vicissitudes of fortune; wherefore, an we would do aright,\r\nneeds must we resign ourselves to take and possess that which is\r\nappointed us of Him who alone knoweth that which behoveth unto us and\r\nis able to give it to us. But for that, whereas men sin in desiring\r\nvarious things, you, gracious ladies, sin, above all, in one, to wit,\r\nin wishing to be fair,--insomuch that, not content with the charms\r\nvouchsafed you by nature, you still with marvellous art study to\r\naugment them,--it pleaseth me to recount to you how ill-fortunedly\r\nfair was a Saracen lady, whom it befell, for her beauty, to be in some\r\nfour years' space nine times wedded anew.\r\n\r\nIt is now a pretty while since there was a certain Soldan of\r\nBabylon,[113] by name Berminedab, to whom in his day many things\r\nhappened in accordance with his pleasure.[114] Amongst many other\r\nchildren, both male and female, he had a daughter called Alatiel, who,\r\nby report of all who saw her, was the fairest woman to be seen in the\r\nworld in those days, and having, in a great defeat he had inflicted\r\nupon a vast multitude of Arabs who were come upon him, been\r\nwonder-well seconded by the King of Algarve,[115] had, at his request,\r\ngiven her to him to wife, of especial favour; wherefore, embarking her\r\naboard a ship well armed and equipped, with an honourable company of\r\nmen and ladies and store of rich and sumptuous gear and furniture, he\r\ndespatched her to him, commending her to God.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: _i.e._ Egypt, Cairo was known in the middle ages by the\r\nname of \"Babylon of Egypt.\" It need hardly be noted that the Babylon\r\nof the Bible was the city of that name on the Euphrates, the ancient\r\ncapital of Chaldæa (Irak Babili). The names Beminedab and Alatiel are\r\npurely imaginary.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: _i.e._ to his wish, to whom fortune was mostly\r\nfavourable in his enterprises.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: _Il Garbo_, Arabic El Gherb or Gharb, [Arabic: al\r\ngharb], the West, a name given by the Arabs to several parts of the\r\nMuslim empire, but by which Boccaccio apparently means Algarve, the\r\nsouthernmost province of Portugal and the last part of that kingdom to\r\nsuccumb to the wave of Christian reconquest, it having remained in the\r\nhands of the Muslims till the second half of the thirteenth century.\r\nThis supposition is confirmed by the course taken by Alatiel's ship,\r\nwhich would naturally pass Sardinia and the Balearic Islands on its\r\nway from Alexandria to Portugal.]\r\n\r\nThe sailors, seeing the weather favourable, gave their sails to the\r\nwind and departing the port of Alexandria, fared on prosperously many\r\ndays, and having now passed Sardinia, deemed themselves near the end\r\nof their voyage, when there arose one day of a sudden divers contrary\r\nwinds, which, being each beyond measure boisterous, so harassed the\r\nship, wherein was the lady, and the sailors, that the latter more than\r\nonce gave themselves over for lost. However, like valiant men, using\r\nevery art and means in their power, they rode it out two days, though\r\nbuffeted by a terrible sea; but, at nightfall of the third day, the\r\ntempest abating not, nay, waxing momently, they felt the ship open,\r\nbeing then not far off Majorca, but knowing not where they were\r\nneither availing to apprehend it either by nautical reckoning or by\r\nsight, for that the sky was altogether obscured by clouds and dark\r\nnight; wherefore, seeing no other way of escape and having each\r\nhimself in mind and not others, they lowered a shallop into the water,\r\ninto which the officers cast themselves, choosing rather to trust\r\nthemselves thereto than to the leaking ship. The rest of the men in\r\nthe ship crowded after them into the boat, albeit those who had first\r\nembarked therein opposed it, knife in hand,--and thinking thus to flee\r\nfrom death, ran straight into it, for that the boat, availing not, for\r\nthe intemperance of the weather, to hold so many, foundered and they\r\nperished one and all.\r\n\r\nAs for the ship, being driven by a furious wind and running very\r\nswiftly, albeit it was now well nigh water-logged, (none being left on\r\nboard save the princess and her women, who all, overcome by the\r\ntempestuous sea and by fear, lay about the decks as they were dead,)\r\nit stranded upon a beach of the island of Majorca and such and so\r\ngreat was the shock that it well nigh buried itself in the sand some\r\nstone's cast from the shore, where it abode the night, beaten by the\r\nwaves, nor might the wind avail to stir it more. Broad day came and\r\nthe tempest somewhat abating, the princess, who was half dead, raised\r\nher head and weak as she was, fell to calling now one, now another of\r\nher household, but to no purpose, for that those she called were too\r\nfar distant. Finding herself unanswered of any and seeing no one, she\r\nmarvelled exceedingly and began to be sore afraid; then, rising up, as\r\nbest she might, she saw the ladies who were in her company and the\r\nother women lying all about and trying now one and now another, found\r\nfew who gave any signs of life, the most of them being dead what with\r\nsore travail of the stomach and what with affright; wherefore fear\r\nredoubled upon her.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, necessity constraining her, for that she saw herself\r\nalone there and had neither knowledge nor inkling where she was, she\r\nso goaded those who were yet alive that she made them arise and\r\nfinding them unknowing whither the men were gone and seeing the ship\r\nstranded and full of water, she fell to weeping piteously, together\r\nwith them. It was noon ere they saw any about the shore or elsewhere,\r\nwhom they might move to pity and succour them; but about that hour\r\nthere passed by a gentleman, by name Pericone da Visalgo, returning by\r\nchance from a place of his, with sundry of his servants on horseback.\r\nHe saw the ship and forthright conceiving what it was, bade one of the\r\nservants board it without delay and tell him what he found there. The\r\nman, though with difficulty, made his way on board and found the young\r\nlady, with what little company she had, crouched, all adread, under\r\nthe heel of the bowsprit. When they saw him, they besought him,\r\nweeping, of mercy again and again; but, perceiving that he understood\r\nthem not nor they him, they made shift to make known to him their\r\nmisadventure by signs.\r\n\r\nThe servant having examined everything as best he might, reported to\r\nPericone that which was on board; whereupon the latter promptly caused\r\nto bring the ladies ashore, together with the most precious things\r\nthat were in the ship and might be gotten, and carried them off to a\r\ncastle of his, where, the women being refreshed with food and rest, he\r\nperceived, from the richness of her apparel, that the lady whom he had\r\nfound must needs be some great gentlewoman, and of this he was\r\nspeedily certified by the honour that he saw the others do her and her\r\nalone; and although she was pale and sore disordered of her person,\r\nfor the fatigues of the voyage, her features seemed to him exceeding\r\nfair; wherefore he forthright took counsel with himself, an she had no\r\nhusband, to seek to have her to wife, and if he might not have her in\r\nmarriage, to make shift to have her favours.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of commanding presence and exceeding robust and having\r\nfor some days let tend the lady excellently well and she being thereby\r\naltogether restored, he saw her lovely past all conception and was\r\ngrieved beyond measure that he could not understand her nor she him\r\nand so he might not learn who she was. Nevertheless, being\r\ninordinately inflamed by her charms, he studied, with pleasing and\r\namorous gestures, to engage her to do his pleasure without contention;\r\nbut to no avail; she altogether rejected his advances and so much the\r\nmore waxed Pericone's ardour. The lady, seeing this and having now\r\nabidden there some days, perceived, by the usances of the folk, that\r\nshe was among Christians and in a country where, even if she could, it\r\nhad little profited her to make herself known and foresaw that, in the\r\nend, either perforce or for love, needs must she resign herself to do\r\nPericone's pleasure, but resolved nevertheless by dint of magnanimity\r\nto override the wretchedness of her fortune; wherefore she commanded\r\nher women, of whom but three were left her, that they should never\r\ndiscover to any who she was, except they found themselves whereas they\r\nmight look for manifest furtherance in the regaining of their liberty,\r\nand urgently exhorted them, moreover, to preserve their chastity,\r\navouching herself determined that none, save her husband, should ever\r\nenjoy her. They commended her for this and promised to observe her\r\ncommandment to the best of their power.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Pericone, waxing daily more inflamed, insomuch as he saw the\r\nthing desired so near and yet so straitly denied, and seeing that his\r\nblandishments availed him nothing, resolved to employ craft and\r\nartifice, reserving force unto the last. Wherefore, having observed\r\nbytimes that wine was pleasing to the lady, as being unused to drink\r\nthereof, for that her law forbade it, he bethought himself that he\r\nmight avail to take her with this, as with a minister of enus.\r\nAccordingly, feigning to reck no more of that whereof she showed\r\nherself so chary, he made one night by way of special festival a\r\ngoodly supper, whereto he bade the lady, and therein, the repast being\r\ngladdened with many things, he took order with him who served her that\r\nhe should give her to drink of various wines mingled. The cupbearer\r\ndid his bidding punctually and she, being nowise on her guard against\r\nthis and allured by the pleasantness of the drink, took more thereof\r\nthan consisted with her modesty; whereupon, forgetting all her past\r\ntroubles, she waxed merry and seeing some women dance after the\r\nfashion of Majorca, herself danced in the Alexandrian manner.\r\n\r\nPericone, seeing this, deemed himself on the high road to that which\r\nhe desired and continuing the supper with great plenty of meats and\r\nwines, protracted it far into the night. Ultimately, the guests having\r\ndeparted, he entered with the lady alone into her chamber, where she,\r\nmore heated with wine than restrained by modesty, without any reserve\r\nof shamefastness, undid herself in his presence, as he had been one of\r\nher women, and betook herself to bed. Pericone was not slow to follow\r\nher, but, putting out all the lights, promptly hid himself beside her\r\nand catching her in his arms, proceeded, without any gainsayal on her\r\npart, amorously to solace himself with her; which when once she had\r\nfelt,--having never theretofore known with what manner horn men\r\nbutt,--as if repenting her of not having yielded to Pericone's\r\nsolicitations, thenceforth, without waiting to be bidden to such\r\nagreeable nights, she oftentimes invited herself thereto, not by\r\nwords, which she knew not how to make understood, but by deeds.\r\n\r\nBut, in the midst of this great pleasance of Pericone and herself,\r\nfortune, not content with having reduced her from a king's bride to be\r\nthe mistress of a country gentleman, had foreordained unto her a more\r\nbarbarous alliance. Pericone had a brother by name Marato,\r\nfive-and-twenty years of age and fair and fresh as a rose, who saw her\r\nand she pleased him mightily. Himseemed, moreover, according to that\r\nwhich he could apprehend from her gestures, that he was very well seen\r\nof her and conceiving that nought hindered him of that which he craved\r\nof her save the strait watch kept on her by Pericone, he fell into a\r\nbarbarous thought, whereon the nefarious effect followed without\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nThere was then, by chance, in the harbour of the city a vessel laden\r\nwith merchandise and bound for Chiarenza[116] in Roumelia; whereof two\r\nyoung Genoese were masters, who had already hoisted sail to depart as\r\nsoon as the wind should be fair. Marato, having agreed with them, took\r\norder how he should on the ensuing night be received aboard their ship\r\nwith the lady; and this done, as soon as it was dark, having inwardly\r\ndetermined what he should do, he secretly betook himself, with certain\r\nof his trustiest friends, whom he had enlisted for the purpose, to the\r\nhouse of Pericone, who nowise mistrusted him. There he hid himself,\r\naccording to the ordinance appointed between them, and after a part of\r\nthe night had passed, he admitted his companions and repaired with\r\nthem to the chamber where Pericone lay with the lady. Having opened\r\nthe door, they slew Pericone, as he slept, and took the lady, who was\r\nnow awake and in tears, threatening her with death, if she made any\r\noutcry; after which they made off, unobserved, with great part of\r\nPericone's most precious things and betook themselves in haste to the\r\nsea-shore, where Marato and the lady embarked without delay on board\r\nthe ship, whilst his companions returned whence they came.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: The modern Klarentza in the north-west of the Morea,\r\nwhich latter province formed part of Roumelia under the Turkish\r\ndomination.]\r\n\r\nThe sailors, having a fair wind and a fresh, made sail and set out on\r\ntheir voyage, whilst the princess sore and bitterly bewailed both her\r\nformer and that her second misadventure; but Marato, with that Saint\r\nWaxeth-in-hand, which God hath given us [men,] proceeded to comfort\r\nher after such a fashion that she soon grew familiar with him and\r\nforgetting Pericone, began to feel at her ease, when fortune, as if\r\nnot content with the past tribulations wherewith it had visited her,\r\nprepared her a new affliction; for that, she being, as we have already\r\nmore than once said, exceeding fair of favour and of very engaging\r\nmanners, the two young men, the masters of the ship, became so\r\npassionately enamoured of her that, forgetting all else, they studied\r\nonly to serve and pleasure her, being still on their guard lest Marato\r\nshould get wind of the cause. Each becoming aware of the other's\r\npassion, they privily took counsel together thereof, and agreed to\r\njoin in getting the lady for themselves and enjoy her in common, as if\r\nlove should suffer this, as do merchandise and gain.\r\n\r\nSeeing her straitly guarded by Marato and being thereby hindered of\r\ntheir purpose, one day, as the ship fared on at full speed under sail\r\nand Marato stood at the poop, looking out on the sea and nowise on his\r\nguard against them, they went of one accord and laying hold of him\r\nsuddenly from behind, cast him into the sea, nor was it till they had\r\nsailed more than a mile farther that any perceived Marato to be\r\nfallen overboard. Alatiel, hearing this and seeing no possible way of\r\nrecovering him, began anew to make moan for herself; whereupon the two\r\nlovers came incontinent to her succour and with soft words and very\r\ngood promises, whereof she understood but little, studied to soothe\r\nand console the lady, who lamented not so much her lost husband as her\r\nown ill fortune. After holding much discourse with her at one time and\r\nanother, themseeming after awhile they had well nigh comforted her,\r\nthey came to words with one another which should first take her to lie\r\nwith him. Each would fain be the first and being unable to come to any\r\naccord upon this, they first with words began a sore and hot dispute\r\nand thereby kindled into rage, they clapped hands to their knives and\r\nfalling furiously on one another, before those on board could part\r\nthem, dealt each other several blows, whereof one incontinent fell\r\ndead, whilst the other abode on life, though grievously wounded in\r\nmany places.\r\n\r\nThis new mishap was sore unpleasing to the lady, who saw herself\r\nalone, without aid or counsel of any, and feared lest the anger of the\r\ntwo masters' kinsfolk and friends should revert upon herself; but the\r\nprayers of the wounded man and their speedy arrival at Chiarenza\r\ndelivered her from danger of death. There she went ashore with the\r\nwounded man and took up her abode with him in an inn, where the report\r\nof her great beauty soon spread through the city and came to the ears\r\nof the Prince of the Morea, who was then at Chiarenza and was fain to\r\nsee her. Having gotten sight of her and himseeming she was fairer than\r\nreport gave out, he straightway became so sore enamoured of her that\r\nhe could think of nothing else and hearing how she came thither,\r\ndoubted not to be able to get her for himself. As he cast about for a\r\nmeans of effecting his purpose, the wounded man's kinsfolk got wind of\r\nhis desire and without awaiting more, sent her to him forthright,\r\nwhich was mighty agreeable to the prince and to the lady also, for\r\nthat herseemed she was quit of a great peril. The prince, seeing her\r\ngraced, over and above her beauty, with royal manners and unable\r\notherwise to learn who she was, concluded her to be some noble lady,\r\nwherefore he redoubled in his love for her and holding her in\r\nexceeding honour, entreated her not as a mistress, but as his very\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nThe lady, accordingly, having regard to her past troubles and\r\nherseeming she was well enough bestowed, was altogether comforted and\r\nwaxing blithe again, her beauties flourished on such wise that it\r\nseemed all Roumelia could talk of nothing else. The report of her\r\nloveliness reaching the Duke of Athens, who was young and handsome and\r\ndoughty of his person and a friend and kinsman of the prince, he was\r\ntaken with a desire to see her and making a show of paying him a\r\nvisit, as he was wont bytimes to do, repaired, with a fair and\r\nworshipful company, to Chiarenza, where he was honourably received and\r\nsumptuously entertained. Some days after, the two kinsmen coming to\r\ndiscourse together of the lady's charms, the duke asked if she were\r\nindeed so admirable a creature as was reported; to which the prince\r\nanswered, 'Much more so; but thereof I will have not my words, but\r\nthine own eyes certify thee.' Accordingly, at the duke's\r\nsolicitation, they betook themselves together to the princess's\r\nlodging, who, having had notice of their coming, received them very\r\ncourteously and with a cheerful favour, and they seated her between\r\nthem, but might not have the pleasure of conversing with her, for that\r\nshe understood little or nothing of their language; wherefore each\r\ncontented himself with gazing upon her, as upon a marvel, and\r\nespecially the duke, who could scarce bring himself to believe that\r\nshe was a mortal creature and thinking to satisfy his desire with her\r\nsight, heedless of the amorous poison he drank in at his eyes,\r\nbeholding her, he miserably ensnared himself, becoming most ardently\r\nenamoured of her.\r\n\r\nAfter he had departed her presence with the prince and had leisure to\r\nbethink himself, he esteemed his kinsman happy beyond all others in\r\nhaving so fair a creature at his pleasure, and after many and various\r\nthoughts, his unruly passion weighing more with him than his honour,\r\nhe resolved, come thereof what might, to do his utmost endeavour to\r\ndespoil the prince of that felicity and bless himself therewith.\r\nAccordingly, being minded to make a quick despatch of the matter and\r\nsetting aside all reason and all equity, he turned his every thought\r\nto the devising of means for the attainment of his wishes, and one\r\nday, in accordance with the nefarious ordinance taken by him with a\r\nprivy chamberlain of the prince's, by name Ciuriaci, he let make ready\r\nin secret his horses and baggage for a sudden departure.\r\n\r\nThe night come, he was, with a companion, both armed, stealthily\r\nintroduced by the aforesaid Ciuriaci into the prince's chamber and saw\r\nthe latter (the lady being asleep) standing, all naked for the great\r\nheat, at a window overlooking the sea-shore, to take a little breeze\r\nthat came from that quarter; whereupon, having beforehand informed his\r\ncompanion of that which he had to do, he went softly up to the window\r\nand striking the prince with a knife, stabbed him, through and through\r\nthe small of his back; then, taking him up in haste, he cast him forth\r\nof the window. The palace stood over against the sea and was very\r\nlofty and the window in question looked upon certain houses that had\r\nbeen undermined by the beating of the waves and where seldom or never\r\nany came; wherefore it happened, as the duke had foreseen, that the\r\nfall of the prince's body was not nor might be heard of any. The\r\nduke's companion, seeing this done, pulled out a halter he had brought\r\nwith him to that end and making a show of caressing Ciuriaci, cast it\r\nadroitly about his neck and drew it so that he could make no outcry;\r\nthen, the duke coming up, they strangled him and cast him whereas they\r\nhad cast the prince.\r\n\r\nThis done and they being manifestly certified that they had been\r\nunheard of the lady or of any other, the duke took a light in his hand\r\nand carrying it to the bedside, softly uncovered the princess, who\r\nslept fast. He considered her from head to foot and mightily commended\r\nher; for, if she was to his liking, being clothed, she pleased him,\r\nnaked, beyond all compare. Wherefore, fired with hotter desire and\r\nunawed by his new-committed crime, he couched himself by her side,\r\nwith hands yet bloody, and lay with her, all sleepy-eyed as she was\r\nand thinking him to be the prince. After he had abidden with her\r\nawhile in the utmost pleasure, he arose and summoning certain of his\r\ncompanions, caused take up the lady on such wise that she could make\r\nno outcry and carry her forth by a privy door, whereat he had entered;\r\nthen, setting her on horseback, he took to the road with all his men,\r\nas softliest he might, and returned to his own dominions. However (for\r\nthat he had a wife) he carried the lady, who was the most distressful\r\nof women, not to Athens, but to a very goodly place he had by the sea,\r\na little without the city, and there entertained her in secret,\r\ncausing honourably furnish her with all that was needful.\r\n\r\nThe prince's courtiers on the morrow awaited his rising till none,\r\nwhen, hearing nothing, they opened the chamber-doors, which were but\r\nclosed, and finding no one, concluded that he was gone somewhither\r\nprivily, to pass some days there at his ease with his fair lady, and\r\ngave themselves no farther concern. Things being thus, it chanced next\r\nday that an idiot, entering the ruins where lay the bodies of the\r\nprince and Ciuriaci, dragged the latter forth by the halter and went\r\nhaling him after him. The body was, with no little wonderment,\r\nrecognized by many, who, coaxing the idiot to bring them to the place\r\nwhence he had dragged it, there, to the exceeding grief of the whole\r\ncity, found the prince's corpse and gave it honourable burial. Then,\r\nenquiring for the authors of so heinous a crime and finding that the\r\nDuke of Athens was no longer there, but had departed by stealth, they\r\nconcluded, even as was the case, that it must be he who had done this\r\nand carried off the lady; whereupon they straightway substituted a\r\nbrother of the dead man to their prince and incited him with all their\r\nmight to vengeance. The new prince, being presently certified by\r\nvarious other circumstances that it was as they had surmised, summoned\r\nhis friends and kinsmen and servants from divers parts and promptly\r\nlevying a great and goodly and powerful army, set out to make war upon\r\nthe Duke of Athens.\r\n\r\nThe latter, hearing of this, on like wise mustered all his forces for\r\nhis own defence, and to his aid came many lords, amongst whom the\r\nEmperor of Constantinople sent Constantine his son and Manual his\r\nnephew, with a great and goodly following. The two princes were\r\nhonourably received by the duke and yet more so by the duchess, for\r\nthat she was their sister,[117] and matters drawing thus daily nearer\r\nunto war, taking her occasion, she sent for them both one day to her\r\nchamber and there, with tears galore and many words, related to them\r\nthe whole story, acquainting them with the causes of the war.\r\nMoreover, she discovered to them the affront done her by the duke in\r\nthe matter of the woman whom it was believed he privily entertained,\r\nand complaining sore thereof, besought them to apply to the matter\r\nsuch remedy as best they might, for the honour of the duke and her own\r\nsolacement.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: _i.e._ sister to the one and cousin to the other.]\r\n\r\nThe young men already knew all the facts as it had been; wherefore,\r\nwithout enquiring farther, they comforted the duchess, as best they\r\nmight, and filled her with good hope. Then, having learned from her\r\nwhere the lady abode, they took their leave and having a mind to see\r\nthe latter, for that they had oftentimes heard her commended for\r\nmarvellous beauty, they besought the duke to show her to them. He,\r\nunmindful of that which had befallen the Prince of the Morea for\r\nhaving shown her to himself, promised to do this and accordingly next\r\nmorning, having let prepare a magnificent collation in a very goodly\r\ngarden that pertained to the lady's place of abode, he carried them\r\nand a few others thither to eat with her. Constantine, sitting with\r\nAlatiel, fell a-gazing upon her, full of wonderment, avouching in\r\nhimself that he had never seen aught so lovely and that certes the\r\nduke must needs be held excused, ay, and whatsoever other, to have so\r\nfair a creature, should do treason or other foul thing, and looking on\r\nher again and again and each time admiring her more, it betided him no\r\notherwise than it had betided the duke; wherefore, taking his leave,\r\nenamoured of her, he abandoned all thought of the war and occupied\r\nhimself with considering how he might take her from the duke,\r\ncarefully concealing his passion the while from every one.\r\n\r\nWhilst he yet burnt in this fire, the time came to go out against the\r\nnew prince, who now drew near to the duke's territories; wherefore the\r\nlatter and Constantine and all the others, sallied forth of Athens\r\naccording to the given ordinance and betook themselves to the defence\r\nof certain frontiers, so the prince might not avail to advance\r\nfarther. When they had lain there some days, Constantine having his\r\nmind and thought still intent upon the lady and conceiving that, now\r\nthe duke was no longer near her, he might very well avail to\r\naccomplish his pleasure, feigned himself sore indisposed of his\r\nperson, to have an occasion of returning to Athens; wherefore, with\r\nthe duke's leave, committing his whole power to Manuel, he returned to\r\nAthens to his sister, and there, after some days, putting her upon\r\ntalk of the affront which herseemed she suffered from the duke by\r\nreason of the lady whom he entertained, he told her that, an it liked\r\nher, he would soon ease her thereof by causing take the lady from\r\nwhereas she was and carry her off. The duchess, conceiving that he did\r\nthis of regard for herself and not for love of the lady, answered that\r\nit liked her exceeding well so but it might be done on such wise that\r\nthe duke should never know that she had been party thereto, which\r\nConstantine fully promised her, and thereupon she consented that he\r\nshould do as seemed best to him.\r\n\r\nConstantine, accordingly, let secretly equip a light vessel and sent\r\nit one evening to the neighbourhood of the garden where the lady\r\nabode; then, having taught certain of his men who were on board what\r\nthey had to do, he repaired with others to the lady's pavilion, where\r\nhe was cheerfully received by those in her service and indeed by the\r\nlady herself, who, at his instance, betook herself with him to the\r\ngarden, attended by her servitors and his companions. There, making as\r\nhe would speak with her on the duke's part, he went with her alone\r\ntowards a gate, which gave upon the sea and had already been opened by\r\none of his men, and calling the bark thither with the given signal, he\r\ncaused suddenly seize the lady and carry her aboard; then, turning to\r\nher people, he said to them, 'Let none stir or utter a word, an he\r\nwould not die; for that I purpose not to rob the duke of his wench,\r\nbut to do away the affront which he putteth upon my sister.'\r\n\r\nTo this none dared make answer; whereupon Constantine, embarking with\r\nhis people and seating himself by the side of the weeping lady, bade\r\nthrust the oars into the water and make off. Accordingly, they put out\r\nto sea and not hieing, but flying,[118] came, after a little after\r\ndaybreak on the morrow, to Egina, where they landed and took rest,\r\nwhilst Constantine solaced himself awhile with the lady, who bemoaned\r\nher ill-fated beauty. Thence, going aboard the bark again, they made\r\ntheir way, in a few days, to Chios, where it pleased Constantine to\r\ntake up his sojourn, as in a place of safety, for fear of his father's\r\nresentment and lest the stolen lady should be taken from him. There\r\nthe fair lady bewailed her ill fate some days, but, being presently\r\ncomforted by Constantine, she began, as she had done otherwhiles, to\r\ntake her pleasure of that which fortune had foreordained to her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: _Non vogando, ma volando._]\r\n\r\nThings being at this pass, Osbech, King of the Turks, who abode in\r\ncontinual war with the Emperor, came by chance to Smyrna, where\r\nhearing how Constantine abode in Chios, without any precaution,\r\nleading a wanton life with a mistress of his, whom he had stolen away,\r\nhe repaired thither one night with some light-armed ships and entering\r\nthe city by stealth with some of his people, took many in their beds,\r\nere they knew of the enemy's coming. Some, who, taking the alert, had\r\nrun to arms, he slew and having burnt the whole place, carried the\r\nbooty and captives on board the ships and returned to Smyrna. When\r\nthey arrived there, Osbech, who was a young man, passing his prisoners\r\nin review, found the fair lady among them and knowing her for her who\r\nhad been taken with Constantine asleep in bed, was mightily rejoiced\r\nat sight of her. Accordingly, he made her his wife without delay, and\r\ncelebrating the nuptials forthright, lay with her some months in all\r\njoyance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Emperor, who had, before these things came to pass,\r\nbeen in treaty with Bassano, King of Cappadocia, to the end that he\r\nshould come down upon Osbech from one side with his power, whilst\r\nhimself assailed him on the other, but had not yet been able to come\r\nto a full accord with him, for that he was unwilling to grant certain\r\nthings which Bassano demanded and which he deemed unreasonable,\r\nhearing what had betided his son and chagrined beyond measure thereat,\r\nwithout hesitating farther, did that which the King of Cappadocia\r\nasked and pressed him as most he might to fall upon Osbech, whilst\r\nhimself made ready to come down upon him from another quarter. Osbech,\r\nhearing this, assembled his army, ere he should be straitened between\r\ntwo such puissant princes, and marched against Bassano, leaving his\r\nfair lady at Smyrna, in charge of a trusty servant and friend of his.\r\nAfter some time he encountered the King of Cappadocia and giving him\r\nbattle, was slain in the mellay and his army discomfited and\r\ndispersed; whereupon Bassano advanced in triumph towards Smyrna,\r\nunopposed, and all the folk submitted to him by the way, as to a\r\nconqueror.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Osbech's servant, Antiochus by name, in whose charge the\r\nlady had been left, seeing her so fair, forgot his plighted faith to\r\nhis friend and master and became enamoured of her, for all he was a\r\nman in years. Urged by love and knowing her tongue (the which was\r\nmighty agreeable to her, as well as it might be to one whom it had\r\nbehoved for some years live as she were deaf and dumb, for that she\r\nunderstood none neither was understanded of any) he began, in a few\r\ndays, to be so familiar with her that, ere long, having no regard to\r\ntheir lord and master who was absent in the field, they passed from\r\nfriendly commerce to amorous privacy, taking marvellous pleasure one\r\nof the other between the sheets. When they heard that Osbech was\r\ndefeated and slain and that Bassano came carrying all before him, they\r\ntook counsel together not to await him there and laying hands on great\r\npart of the things of most price that were there pertaining to Osbech,\r\ngat them privily to Rhodes, where they had not long abidden ere\r\nAntiochus sickened unto death.\r\n\r\nAs chance would have it, there was then in lodging with him a merchant\r\nof Cyprus, who was much loved of him and his fast friend, and\r\nAntiochus, feeling himself draw to his end, bethought himself to leave\r\nhim both his possessions and his beloved lady; wherefore, being now\r\nnigh upon death, he called them both to him and bespoke them thus, 'I\r\nfeel myself, without a doubt, passing away, which grieveth me, for\r\nthat never had I such delight in life as I presently have. Of one\r\nthing, indeed, I die most content, in that, since I must e'en die, I\r\nsee myself die in the arms of those twain whom I love over all others\r\nthat be in the world, to wit, in thine, dearest friend, and in those\r\nof this lady, whom I have loved more than mine own self, since first I\r\nknew her. True, it grieveth me to feel that, when I am dead, she will\r\nabide here a stranger, without aid or counsel; and it were yet more\r\ngrievous to me, did I not know thee here, who wilt, I trust, have that\r\nsame care of her, for the love of me, which thou wouldst have had of\r\nmyself. Wherefore, I entreat thee, as most I may, if it come to pass\r\nthat I die, that thou take my goods and her into thy charge and do\r\nwith them and her that which thou deemest may be for the solacement of\r\nmy soul. And thou, dearest lady, I prithee forget me not after my\r\ndeath, so I may vaunt me, in the other world, of being beloved here\r\nbelow of the fairest lady ever nature formed; of which two things an\r\nyou will give me entire assurance, I shall depart without misgiving\r\nand comforted.'\r\n\r\nThe merchant his friend and the lady, hearing these words, wept, and\r\nwhen he had made an end of his speech, they comforted him and promised\r\nhim upon their troth to do that which he asked, if it came to pass\r\nthat he died. He tarried not long, but presently departed this life\r\nand was honourably interred of them. A few days after, the merchant\r\nhaving despatched all his business in Rhodes and purposing to return\r\nto Cyprus on board a Catalan carrack that was there, asked the fair\r\nlady what she had a mind to do, for that it behoved him return to\r\nCyprus. She answered that, an it pleased him, she would gladly go with\r\nhim, hoping for Antiochus his love to be of him entreated and regarded\r\nas a sister. The merchant replied that he was content to do her every\r\npleasure, and the better to defend her from any affront that might be\r\noffered her, ere they came to Cyprus, he avouched that she was his\r\nwife. Accordingly, they embarked on board the ship and were given a\r\nlittle cabin on the poop, where, that the fact might not belie his\r\nwords, he lay with her in one very small bed. Whereby there came about\r\nthat which was not intended of the one or the other of them at\r\ndeparting Rhodes, to wit, that--darkness and commodity and the heat of\r\nthe bed, matters of no small potency, inciting them,--drawn by equal\r\nappetite and forgetting both the friendship and the love of Antiochus\r\ndead, they fell to dallying with each other and before they reached\r\nBaffa, whence the Cypriot came, they had clapped up an alliance\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nAt Baffa she abode some time with the merchant till, as chance would\r\nhave it, there came thither, for his occasions, a gentleman by name\r\nAntigonus, great of years and greater yet of wit, but little of\r\nwealth, for that, intermeddling in the affairs of the King of Cyprus,\r\nfortune had in many things been contrary to him. Chancing one day to\r\npass by the house where the fair lady dwelt with the merchant, who was\r\nthen gone with his merchandise into Armenia, he espied her at a window\r\nand seeing her very beautiful, fell to gazing fixedly upon her and\r\npresently began to recollect that he must have seen her otherwhere,\r\nbut where he could on no wise call to mind. As for the lady, who had\r\nlong been the sport of fortune, but the term of whose ills was now\r\ndrawing near, she no sooner set eyes on Antigonus than she remembered\r\nto have seen him at Alexandria in no mean station in her father's\r\nservice; wherefore, conceiving a sudden hope of yet by his aid\r\nregaining her royal estate, and knowing her merchant to be abroad, she\r\nlet call him to her as quickliest she might and asked him, blushing,\r\nan he were not, as she supposed, Antigonus of Famagosta. He answered\r\nthat he was and added, 'Madam, meseemeth I know you, but on no wise\r\ncan I remember me where I have seen you; wherefore I pray you, an it\r\nmislike you not, put me in mind who you are.'\r\n\r\nThe lady hearing that it was indeed he, to his great amazement, cast\r\nher arms about his neck, weeping sore, and presently asked him if he\r\nhad never seen her in Alexandria. Antigonus, hearing this, incontinent\r\nknew her for the Soldan's daughter Alatiel, who was thought to have\r\nperished at sea, and would fain have paid her the homage due to her\r\nquality; but she would on no wise suffer it and besought him to sit\r\nwith her awhile. Accordingly, seating himself beside her, he asked her\r\nrespectfully how and when and whence she came thither, seeing that it\r\nwas had for certain, through all the land of Egypt, that she had been\r\ndrowned at sea years agone. 'Would God,' replied she, 'it had been so,\r\nrather than that I should have had the life I have had; and I doubt\r\nnot but my father would wish the like, if ever he came to know it.'\r\n\r\nSo saying, she fell anew to weeping wonder-sore; whereupon quoth\r\nAntigonus to her, 'Madam, despair not ere it behove you; but, an it\r\nplease you, relate to me your adventures and what manner of life yours\r\nhath been; it may be the matter hath gone on such wise that, with\r\nGod's aid, we may avail to find an effectual remedy.' 'Antigonus,'\r\nanswered the fair lady, 'when I beheld thee, meseemed I saw my father,\r\nand moved by that love and tenderness, which I am bounden to bear him,\r\nI discovered myself to thee, having it in my power to conceal myself\r\nfrom thee, and few persons could it have befallen me to look upon in\r\nwhom I could have been so well-pleased as I am to have seen and known\r\nthee before any other; wherefore that which in my ill fortune I have\r\nstill kept hidden, to thee, as to a father, I will discover. If, after\r\nthou hast heard it, thou see any means of restoring me to my pristine\r\nestate, prithee use it; but, if thou see none, I beseech thee never\r\ntell any that thou hast seen me or heard aught of me.'\r\n\r\nThis said, she recounted to him, still weeping, that which had\r\nbefallen her from the time of her shipwreck on Majorca up to that\r\nmoment; whereupon he fell a-weeping for pity and after considering\r\nawhile, 'Madam,' said he, 'since in your misfortunes it hath been\r\nhidden who you are, I will, without fail, restore you, dearer than\r\never, to your father and after to the King of Algarve to wife.' Being\r\nquestioned of her of the means, he showed her orderly that which was\r\nto do, and lest any hindrance should betide through delay, he\r\npresently returned to Famagosta and going in to the king, said to him,\r\n'My lord, an it like you, you have it in your power at once to do\r\nyourself exceeding honour and me, who am poor through you, a great\r\nservice, at no great cost of yours.' The king asked how and Antigonus\r\nreplied, 'There is come to Baffa the Soldan's fair young daughter, who\r\nhath so long been reputed drowned and who, to save her honour, hath\r\nlong suffered very great unease and is presently in poor case and\r\nwould fain return to her father. An it pleased you send her to him\r\nunder my guard, it would be much to your honour and to my weal, nor do\r\nI believe that such a service would ever be forgotten of the Soldan.'\r\n\r\nThe king, moved by a royal generosity of mind, answered forthright\r\nthat he would well and sending for Alatiel, brought her with all\r\nhonour and worship to Famagosta, where she was received by himself and\r\nthe queen with inexpressible rejoicing and entertained with\r\nmagnificent hospitality. Being presently questioned of the king and\r\nqueen of her adventures, she answered according to the instructions\r\ngiven her by Antigonus and related everything;[119] and a few days\r\nafter, at her request, the king sent her, under the governance of\r\nAntigonus, with a goodly and worshipful company of men and women, back\r\nto the Soldan, of whom let none ask if she was received with\r\nrejoicing, as also was Antigonus and all her company.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: Sic (_contò tutto_); but this is an oversight of the\r\nauthor's, as it is evident from what follows that she did _not_ relate\r\neverything.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was somewhat rested, the Soldan desired to know how it\r\nchanced that she was yet alive and where she had so long abidden,\r\nwithout having ever let him know aught of her condition; whereupon the\r\nlady, who had kept Antigonus his instructions perfectly in mind,\r\nbespoke him thus, 'Father mine, belike the twentieth day after my\r\ndeparture from you, our ship, having sprung a leak in a terrible\r\nstorm, struck in the night upon certain coasts yonder in the\r\nWest,[120] near a place called Aguamorta, and what became of the men\r\nwho were aboard I know not nor could ever learn; this much only do I\r\nremember that, the day come and I arisen as it were from death to\r\nlife, the shattered vessel was espied of the country people, who ran\r\nfrom all the parts around to plunder it. I and two of my women were\r\nfirst set ashore and the latter were incontinent seized by certain of\r\nthe young men, who fled with them, one this way and the other that,\r\nand what came of them I never knew.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: Lit. Ponant (_Ponente_), _i.e._ the Western coasts of\r\nthe Mediterranean, as opposed to the Eastern or Levant.]\r\n\r\nAs for myself, I was taken, despite my resistance, by two young men,\r\nand haled along by the hair, weeping sore the while; but, as they\r\ncrossed over a road, to enter a great wood, there passed by four men\r\non horseback, whom when my ravishers saw, they loosed me forthwith and\r\ntook to flight. The new comers, who seemed to me persons of great\r\nauthority, seeing this, ran where I was and asked me many questions;\r\nwhereto I answered much, but neither understood nor was understanded\r\nof them. However, after long consultation they set me on one of their\r\nhorses and carried me to a convent of women vowed to religion,\r\naccording to their law, where, whatever they said, I was of all the\r\nladies kindly received and still entreated with honour, and there with\r\ngreat devotion I joined them in serving Saint Waxeth-in-Deepdene, a\r\nsaint for whom the women of that country have a vast regard.\r\n\r\nAfter I had abidden with them awhile and learned somewhat of their\r\nlanguage, they questioned me of who I was and fearing, an I told the\r\ntruth, to be expelled from amongst them, as an enemy of their faith, I\r\nanswered that I was the daughter of a great gentleman of Cyprus, who\r\nwas sending me to be married in Crete, when, as ill-luck would have\r\nit, we had run thither and suffered shipwreck. Moreover, many a time\r\nand in many things I observed their customs, for fear of worse, and\r\nbeing asked by the chief of the ladies, her whom they call abbess, if\r\nI wished to return thence to Cyprus, I answered that I desired nothing\r\nso much; but she, tender of my honour, would never consent to trust me\r\nto any person who was bound for Cyprus, till some two months agone,\r\nwhen there came thither certain gentlemen of France with their ladies.\r\nOne of the latter being a kinswoman of the abbess and she hearing that\r\nthey were bound for Jerusalem, to visit the Sepulchre where He whom\r\nthey hold God was buried, after He had been slain by the Jews, she\r\ncommended me to their care and besought them to deliver me to my\r\nfather in Cyprus.\r\n\r\nWith what honour these gentlemen entreated me and how cheerfully they\r\nreceived me together with their ladies, it were a long story to tell;\r\nsuffice it to say that we took ship and came, after some days, to\r\nBaffa, where finding myself arrived and knowing none in the place, I\r\nknew not what to say to the gentlemen, who would fain have delivered\r\nme to my father, according to that which had been enjoined them of the\r\nreverend lady; but God, taking pity belike on my affliction, brought\r\nme Antigonus upon the beach what time we disembarked at Baffa, whom I\r\nstraightway hailed and in our tongue, so as not to be understood of\r\nthe gentlemen and their ladies, bade him receive me as a daughter. He\r\npromptly apprehended me and receiving me with a great show of joy,\r\nentertained the gentlemen and their ladies with such honour as his\r\npoverty permitted and carried me to the King of Cyprus, who received\r\nme with such hospitality and hath sent me back to you [with such\r\ncourtesy] as might never be told of me. If aught remain to be said,\r\nlet Antigonus, who hath ofttimes heard from me these adventures,\r\nrecount it.'\r\n\r\nAccordingly Antigonus, turning to the Soldan, said, 'My lord, even as\r\nshe hath many a time told me and as the gentlemen and ladies, with\r\nwhom she came, said to me, so hath she recounted unto you. Only one\r\npart hath she forborne to tell you, the which methinketh she left\r\nunsaid for that it beseemeth her not to tell it, to wit, how much the\r\ngentlemen and ladies, with whom she came, said of the chaste and\r\nmodest life which she led with the religious ladies and of her virtue\r\nand commendable manners and the tears and lamentations of her\r\ncompanions, both men and women, when, having restored her to me, they\r\ntook leave of her. Of which things were I fain to tell in full that\r\nwhich they said to me, not only this present day, but the ensuing\r\nnight would not suffice unto us; be it enough to say only that\r\n(according to that which their words attested and that also which I\r\nhave been able to see thereof,) you may vaunt yourself of having the\r\nfairest daughter and the chastest and most virtuous of any prince that\r\nnowadays weareth a crown.'\r\n\r\nThe Soldan was beyond measure rejoiced at these things and besought\r\nGod again and again to vouchsafe him of His grace the power of\r\nworthily requiting all who had succoured his daughter and especially\r\nthe King of Cyprus, by whom she had been sent back to him with honour.\r\nAfter some days, having caused prepare great gifts for Antigonus, he\r\ngave him leave to return to Cyprus and rendered, both by letters and\r\nby special ambassadors, the utmost thanks to the king for that which\r\nhe had done with his daughter. Then desiring that that which was begun\r\nshould have effect, to wit, that she should be the wife of the King of\r\nAlgarve, he acquainted the latter with the whole matter and wrote to\r\nhim to boot, that, an it pleased him have her, he should send for her.\r\nThe King of Algarve was mightily rejoiced at this news and sending for\r\nher in state, received her joyfully; and she, who had lain with eight\r\nmen belike ten thousand times, was put to bed to him for a maid and\r\nmaking him believe that she was so, lived happily with him as his\r\nqueen awhile after; wherefore it was said, 'Lips for kissing forfeit\r\nno favour; nay, they renew as the moon doth ever.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Second]\r\n\r\n     THE COUNT OF ANTWERP, BEING FALSELY ACCUSED, GOETH INTO\r\n     EXILE AND LEAVETH HIS TWO CHILDREN IN DIFFERENT PLACES IN\r\n     ENGLAND, WHITHER, AFTER AWHILE, RETURNING IN DISGUISE AND\r\n     FINDING THEM IN GOOD CASE, HE TAKETH SERVICE AS A HORSEBOY\r\n     IN THE SERVICE OF THE KING OF FRANCE AND BEING APPROVED\r\n     INNOCENT, IS RESTORED TO HIS FORMER ESTATE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ladies sighed amain over the fortunes of the fair Saracen; but who\r\nknoweth what gave rise to those sighs? Maybe there were some of them\r\nwho sighed no less for envy of such frequent nuptials than for pity of\r\nAlatiel. But, leaving that be for the present, after they had laughed\r\nat Pamfilo's last words, the queen, seeing his story ended, turned to\r\nElisa and bade her follow on with one of hers. Elisa cheerfully obeyed\r\nand began as follows: \"A most ample field is that wherein we go to-day\r\na-ranging, nor is there any of us but could lightly enough run, not\r\none, but half a score courses there, so abounding hath Fortune made it\r\nin her strange and grievous chances; wherefore, to come to tell of one\r\nof these latter, which are innumerable, I say that:\r\n\r\nWhen the Roman Empire was transferred from the French to the\r\nGermans,[121] there arose between the one and the other nation an\r\nexceeding great enmity and a grievous and continual war, by reason\r\nwhereof, as well for the defence of their own country as for the\r\noffence of that of others, the King of France and a son of his, with\r\nall the power of their realm and of such friends and kinsfolk as they\r\ncould command, levied a mighty army to go forth upon the foe; and ere\r\nthey proceeded thereunto,--not to leave the realm without\r\ngovernance,--knowing Gautier, Count of Antwerp,[122] for a noble and\r\ndiscreet gentleman and their very faithful friend and servant, and for\r\nthat (albeit he was well versed in the art of war) he seemed to them\r\nmore apt unto things delicate than unto martial toils, they left him\r\nvicar general in their stead over all the governance of the realm of\r\nFrance and went on their way. Gautier accordingly addressed himself\r\nwith both order and discretion to the office committed unto him, still\r\nconferring of everything with the queen and her daughter-in-law, whom,\r\nfor all they were left under his custody and jurisdiction, he honoured\r\nnone the less as his liege ladies and mistresses.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: _i.e._ A.D. 912, when, upon the death of Louis III, the\r\nlast prince of the Carlovingian race, Conrad, Duke of Franconia, was\r\nelected Emperor and the Empire, which had till then been hereditary in\r\nthe descendants of Charlemagne, became elective and remained\r\nthenceforth in German hands.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: _Anguersa_, the old form of _Anversa_, Antwerp. All\r\nversions that I have seen call Gautier Comte d'_Angers_ or _Angiers_,\r\nthe translators, who forgot or were unaware that Antwerp, as part of\r\nFlanders, was then a fief of the French crown, apparently taking it\r\nfor granted that the mention of the latter city was in error and\r\nsubstituting the name of the ancient capital of Anjou on their own\r\nresponsibility.]\r\n\r\nNow this Gautier was exceedingly goodly of his body, being maybe\r\nforty years old and as agreeable and well-mannered a gentleman as\r\nmight be; and withal, he was the sprightliest and daintiest cavalier\r\nknown in those days and he who went most adorned of his person. His\r\ncountess was dead, leaving him two little children, a boy and a girl,\r\nwithout more, and it befell that, the King of France and his son being\r\nat the war aforesaid and Gautier using much at the court of the\r\naforesaid ladies and speaking often with them of the affairs of the\r\nkingdom, the wife of the king's son cast her eyes on him and\r\nconsidering his person and his manners with very great affection, was\r\nsecretly fired with a fervent love for him. Feeling herself young and\r\nlusty and knowing him wifeless, she doubted not but her desire might\r\nlightly be accomplished unto her and thinking nought hindered her\r\nthereof but shamefastness, she bethought herself altogether to put\r\nthat away and discover to him her passion. Accordingly, being one day\r\nalone and it seeming to her time, she sent for him into her chamber,\r\nas though she would discourse with him of other matters.\r\n\r\nThe count, whose thought was far from that of the lady, betook himself\r\nto her without any delay and at her bidding, seated himself by her\r\nside on a couch; then, they being alone together, he twice asked her\r\nthe occasion for which she had caused him come thither; but she made\r\nhim no reply. At last, urged by love and grown all vermeil for shame,\r\nwell nigh in tears and all trembling, with broken speech she thus\r\nbegan to say: 'Dearest and sweet friend and my lord, you may easily as\r\na man of understanding apprehend how great is the frailty both of men\r\nand of women, and that more, for divers reasons, in one than in\r\nanother; wherefore, at the hands of a just judge, the same sin in\r\ndiverse kinds of qualities of persons should not in equity receive one\r\nsame punishment. And who is there will deny that a poor man or a poor\r\nwoman, whom it behoveth gain with their toil that which is needful for\r\ntheir livelihood, would, an they were stricken with Love's smart and\r\nfollowed after him, be far more blameworthy than a lady who is rich\r\nand idle and to whom nothing is lacking that can flatter her desires?\r\nCertes, I believe, no one. For which reason methinketh the things\r\naforesaid [to wit, wealth and leisure and luxurious living] should\r\nfurnish forth a very great measure of excuse on behalf of her who\r\npossesseth them, if, peradventure, she suffer herself lapse into\r\nloving, and the having made choice of a lover of worth and discretion\r\nshould stand for the rest,[123] if she who loveth hath done that.\r\nThese circumstances being both, to my seeming, in myself (beside\r\nseveral others which should move me to love, such as my youth and the\r\nabsence of my husband), it behoveth now that they rise up in my behalf\r\nfor the defence of my ardent love in your sight, wherein if they avail\r\nthat which they should avail in the eyes of men of understanding, I\r\npray you afford me counsel and succour in that which I shall ask of\r\nyou. True is it, that availing not, for the absence of my husband, to\r\nwithstand the pricks of the flesh nor the might of love-liking, the\r\nwhich are of such potency that they have erst many a time overcome and\r\nyet all days long overcome the strongest men, to say nothing of weak\r\nwomen,--and enjoying the commodities and the leisures wherein you see\r\nme, I have suffered myself lapse into ensuing Love his pleasures and\r\nbecoming enamoured; the which,--albeit, were it known, I acknowledge\r\nit would not be seemly, yet,--being and abiding hidden, I hold[124]\r\nwell nigh nothing unseemly; more by token that Love hath been insomuch\r\ngracious to me that not only hath he not bereft me of due discernment\r\nin the choice of a lover, but hath lent me great plenty thereof[125]\r\nto that end, showing me yourself worthy to be loved of a lady such as\r\nI,--you whom, if my fancy beguile me not, I hold the goodliest, the\r\nmost agreeable, the sprightliest and the most accomplished cavalier\r\nthat may be found in all the realm of France; and even as I may say\r\nthat I find myself without a husband, so likewise are you without a\r\nwife. Wherefore, I pray you, by the great love which I bear you, that\r\nyou deny me not your love in return, but have compassion on my youth,\r\nthe which, in very deed, consumeth for you, as ice before the fire.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: _i.e._ of her excuse.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: Lit. Thou holdest (or judges); but _giudichi_ in the\r\ntext is apparently a mistake for _giudico_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: _i.e._ of discernment.]\r\n\r\nWith these words her tears welled up in such abundance that, albeit\r\nshe would fain have proffered him yet other prayers, she had no power\r\nto speak farther, but, bowing her face, as if overcome, she let\r\nherself fall, weeping, her head on the count's bosom. The latter, who\r\nwas a very loyal gentleman, began with the gravest reproofs to rebuke\r\nso fond a passion and to repel the princess, who would fain have cast\r\nherself on his neck, avouching to her with oaths that he had liefer be\r\ntorn limb from limb than consent unto such an offence against his\r\nlord's honour, whether in himself or in another. The lady, hearing\r\nthis, forthright forgot her love and kindling into a furious rage,\r\nsaid, 'Felon knight that you are, shall I be this wise flouted by you\r\nof my desire? Now God forbid, since you would have me die, but I have\r\nyou put to death or driven from the world!' So saying, she set her\r\nhands to her tresses and altogether disordered and tore them; then,\r\nrending her raiment at the breast, she fell to crying aloud and\r\nsaying, 'Help! Help! The Count of Antwerp would do me violence.' The\r\ncount, seeing this, misdoubting far more the courtiers' envy than his\r\nown conscience and fearful lest, by reason of this same envy, more\r\ncredence should be given to the lady's malice than to his own\r\ninnocence, started up and departing the chamber and the palace as\r\nquickliest he might, fled to his own house, where, without taking\r\nother counsel, he set his children on horseback and mounting himself\r\nto horse, made off with them, as most he might, towards Calais.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, many ran to the princess's clamour and seeing her in that\r\nplight and hearing [her account of] the cause of her outcry, not only\r\ngave credence to her words, but added[126] that the count's gallant\r\nbearing and debonair address had long been used by him to win to that\r\nend. Accordingly, they ran in a fury to his houses to arrest him, but\r\nfinding him not, first plundered them all and after razed them to the\r\nfoundations. The news, in its perverted shape, came presently to the\r\narmy to the king and his son, who, sore incensed, doomed Gautier and\r\nhis descendants to perpetual banishment, promising very great guerdons\r\nto whoso should deliver him to them alive or dead.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: Sic (_aggiunsero_); but _semble_ should mean \"believed,\r\nin addition.\"]\r\n\r\nThe count, woeful for that by his flight he had, innocent as he was,\r\napproved himself guilty, having, without making himself known or being\r\nrecognized, reached Calais with his children, passed hastily over into\r\nEngland and betook himself in mean apparel to London, wherein ere he\r\nentered, with many words he lessoned his two little children, and\r\nespecially in two things; first, that they should brook with patience\r\nthe poor estate, whereunto, without their fault, fortune had brought\r\nthem, together with himself,--and after, that with all wariness they\r\nshould keep themselves from ever discovering unto any whence or whose\r\nchildren they were, as they held life dear. The boy, Louis by name,\r\nwho was some nine and the girl, who was called Violante and was some\r\nseven years old, both, as far as their tender age comported, very well\r\napprehended their father's lessons and showed it thereafter by deed.\r\nThat this might be the better done,[127] he deemed it well to change\r\ntheir names; wherefore he named the boy Perrot and the girl Jeannette\r\nand all three, entering London, meanly clad, addressed themselves to\r\ngo about asking alms, like as we see yonder French vagabonds do.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: _i.e._ That the secret might be the better kept.]\r\n\r\nThey being on this account one morning at a church door, it chanced\r\nthat a certain great lady, the wife of one of the king's marshals of\r\nEngland, coming forth of the church, saw the count and his two little\r\nones asking alms and questioned him whence he was and if the children\r\nwere his, to which he replied that he was from Picardy and that, by\r\nreason of the misfeasance of a rakehelly elder son of his, it had\r\nbehoved him depart the country with these two, who were his. The lady,\r\nwho was pitiful, cast her eyes on the girl and being much taken with\r\nher, for that she was handsome, well-mannered and engaging, said,\r\n'Honest man, an thou be content to leave thy daughter with me, I will\r\nwillingly take her, for that she hath a good favour, and if she prove\r\nan honest woman, I will in due time marry her on such wise that she\r\nshall fare well.' This offer was very pleasing to the count, who\r\npromptly answered, 'Yes,' and with tears gave up the girl to the lady,\r\nurgently commending her to her care.\r\n\r\nHaving thus disposed of his daughter, well knowing to whom, he\r\nresolved to abide there no longer and accordingly, begging his way\r\nacross the island, came, not without sore fatigue, as one who was\r\nunused to go afoot, into Wales. Here dwelt another of the king's\r\nmarshals, who held great state and entertained a numerous household,\r\nand to his court both the count and his son whiles much resorted to\r\nget food. Certain sons of the said marshal and other gentlemen's\r\nchildren being there engaged in such boyish exercises as running and\r\nleaping, Perrot began to mingle with them and to do as dextrously as\r\nany of the rest, or more so, each feat that was practised among them.\r\nThe marshal, chancing whiles to see this and being much taken with\r\nthe manners and fashion of the boy, asked who he was and was told that\r\nhe was the son of a poor man who came there bytimes for alms;\r\nwhereupon he caused require him of the count, and the latter, who\r\nindeed besought God of nought else, freely resigned the boy to him,\r\ngrievous as it was to him to be parted from him. Having thus provided\r\nhis son and daughter, he determined to abide no longer in England and\r\npassing over into Ireland, made his way, as best he might, to\r\nStamford, where he took service with a knight belonging to an earl of\r\nthe country, doing all such things as pertain unto a lackey or a\r\nhorseboy, and there, without being known of any, he abode a great\r\nwhile in unease and travail galore.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Violante, called Jeannette, went waxing with the gentlewoman\r\nin London in years and person and beauty and was in such favour both\r\nwith the lady and her husband and with every other of the house and\r\nwhoso else knew her, that it was a marvellous thing to see; nor was\r\nthere any who noted her manners and fashions but avouched her worthy\r\nof every greatest good and honour. Wherefore the noble lady who had\r\nreceived her from her father, without having ever availed to learn who\r\nhe was, otherwise than as she had heard from himself, was purposed to\r\nmarry her honourably according to that condition whereof she deemed\r\nher. But God, who is a just observer of folk's deserts, knowing her to\r\nbe of noble birth and to bear, without fault, the penalty of another's\r\nsin, ordained otherwise, and fain must we believe that He of His\r\nbenignity permitted that which came to pass to the end that the gentle\r\ndamsel might not fall into the hands of a man of low estate.\r\n\r\nThe noble lady with whom Jeannette dwelt had of her husband one only\r\nson, whom both she and his father loved with an exceeding love, both\r\nfor that he was their child and that he deserved it by reason of his\r\nworth and virtues. He, being some six years older than Jeannette and\r\nseeing her exceeding fair and graceful, became so sore enamoured of\r\nher that he saw nought beyond her; yet, for that he deemed her to be\r\nof mean extraction, not only dared he not demand her of his father and\r\nmother to wife, but, fearing to be blamed for having set himself to\r\nlove unworthily, he held his love, as most he might, hidden; wherefore\r\nit tormented him far more than if he had discovered it; and thus it\r\ncame to pass that, for excess of chagrin, he fell sick and that\r\ngrievously. Divers physicians were called in to medicine him, who,\r\nhaving noted one and another symptom of his case and being\r\nnevertheless unable to discover what ailed him, all with one accord\r\ndespaired of his recovery; whereat the young man's father and mother\r\nsuffered dolour and melancholy so great that greater might not be\r\nbrooked, and many a time, with piteous prayers, they questioned him of\r\nthe cause of his malady, whereto or sighs he gave for answer or\r\nreplied that he felt himself all wasting away.\r\n\r\nIt chanced one day that, what while a doctor, young enough, but\r\nexceedingly deeply versed in science, sat by him and held him by the\r\narm in that part where leaches use to seek the pulse, Jeannette, who,\r\nof regard for his mother, tended him solicitously, entered, on some\r\noccasion or another, the chamber where the young man lay. When the\r\nlatter saw her, without word said or gesture made, he felt the amorous\r\nardour redouble in his heart, wherefore his pulse began to beat\r\nstronglier than of wont; the which the leach incontinent noted and\r\nmarvelling, abode still to see how long this should last. As soon as\r\nJeannette left the chamber, the beating abated, wherefore it seemed to\r\nthe physician he had gotten impartment of the cause of the young man's\r\nailment, and after waiting awhile, he let call Jeannette to him, as he\r\nwould question her of somewhat, still holding the sick man by the arm.\r\nShe came to him incontinent and no sooner did she enter than the\r\nbeating of the youth's pulse returned and she being gone again,\r\nceased. Thereupon, it seeming to the physician that he had full enough\r\nassurance, he rose and taking the young man's father and mother apart,\r\nsaid to them, 'The healing of your son is not in the succour of\r\nphysicians, but abideth in the hands of Jeannette, whom, as I have by\r\nsure signs manifestly recognized, the young man ardently loveth,\r\nalbeit, for all I can see, she is unaware thereof. You know now what\r\nyou have to do, if his life be dear to you.'\r\n\r\nThe gentleman and his lady, hearing this, were well pleased, inasmuch\r\nas some means was found for his recoverance, albeit it irked them sore\r\nthat the means in question should be that whereof they misdoubted\r\nthem, to wit, that they should give Jeannette to their son to wife.\r\nAccordingly, the physician being gone, they went into the sick man and\r\nthe lady bespoke him thus: 'Son mine, I could never have believed that\r\nthou wouldst keep from me any desire of thine, especially seeing\r\nthyself pine away for lack thereof; for that thou shouldst have been\r\nand shouldst be assured that there is nought I can for thy\r\ncontentment, were it even less than seemly, which I would not do as\r\nfor myself. But, since thou hast e'en done this, God the Lord hath\r\nbeen more pitiful over thee than thou thyself and that thou mayst not\r\ndie of this sickness, hath shown me the cause of thine ill, which is\r\nno otherwhat than excess of love for some damsel or other, whoever she\r\nmay be; and this, indeed, thou needest not have thought shame to\r\ndiscover, for that thine age requireth it, and wert thou not\r\nenamoured, I should hold thee of very little account. Wherefore, my\r\nson, dissemble not with me, but in all security discover to me thine\r\nevery desire and put away from thee the melancholy and the\r\nthought-taking which be upon thee and from which proceedeth this thy\r\nsickness and take comfort and be assured that there is nothing of that\r\nwhich thou mayst impose on me for thy satisfaction but I will do it to\r\nthe best of my power, as she who loveth thee more than her life.\r\nBanish shamefastness and fearfulness and tell me if I can do aught to\r\nfurther thy passion; and if thou find me not diligent therein or if I\r\nbring it not to effect for thee, account me the cruellest mother that\r\never bore son.'\r\n\r\nThe young man, hearing his mother's words, was at first abashed, but\r\npresently, bethinking himself that none was better able than she to\r\nsatisfy his wishes, he put away shamefastness and said thus to her:\r\n'Madam, nothing hath wrought so effectually with me to keep my love\r\nhidden as my having noted of most folk that, once they are grown in\r\nyears, they choose not to remember them of having themselves been\r\nyoung. But, since in this I find you reasonable, not only will I not\r\ndeny that to be true which you say you have observed, but I will, to\r\nboot, discover to you of whom [I am enamoured], on condition that you\r\nwill, to the best of your power, give effect to your promise; and thus\r\nmay you have me whole again.' Whereto the lady (trusting overmuch in\r\nthat which was not to come to pass for her on such wise as she deemed\r\nin herself) answered freely that he might in all assurance discover to\r\nher his every desire, for that she would without any delay address\r\nherself to contrive that he should have his pleasure. 'Madam,' then\r\nsaid the youth, 'the exceeding beauty and commendable fashions of our\r\nJeannette and my unableness to make her even sensible, still less to\r\nmove her to pity, of my love and the having never dared to discover it\r\nunto any have brought me whereas you see me; and if that which you\r\nhave promised me come not, one way or another, to pass, you may be\r\nassured that my life will be brief.'\r\n\r\nThe lady, to whom it appeared more a time for comfort than for\r\nreproof, said, smilingly, 'Alack, my son, hast thou then for this\r\nsuffered thyself to languish thus? Take comfort and leave me do, once\r\nthou shalt be recovered.' The youth, full of good hope, in a very\r\nshort time showed signs of great amendment, whereas the lady, being\r\nmuch rejoiced, began to cast about how she might perform that which\r\nshe had promised him. Accordingly, calling Jeannette to her one day,\r\nshe asked her very civilly, as by way of a jest, if she had a lover;\r\nwhereupon she waxed all red and answered, 'Madam, it concerneth not\r\nneither were it seemly in a poor damsel like myself, banished from\r\nhouse and home and abiding in others' service, to think of love.'\r\nQuoth the lady, 'An you have no lover, we mean to give you one, in\r\nwhom you may rejoice and live merry and have more delight of your\r\nbeauty, for it behoveth not that so handsome a girl as you are abide\r\nwithout a lover.' To this Jeannette made answer, 'Madam, you took me\r\nfrom my father's poverty and have reared me as a daughter, wherefore\r\nit behoveth me to do your every pleasure; but in this I will nowise\r\ncomply with you, and therein methinketh I do well. If it please you\r\ngive me a husband, him do I purpose to love, but none other; for that,\r\nsince of the inheritance of my ancestors nought is left me save only\r\nhonour, this latter I mean to keep and preserve as long as life shall\r\nendure to me.'\r\n\r\nThis speech seemed to the lady very contrary to that whereto she\r\nthought to come for the keeping of her promise to her son,--albeit,\r\nlike a discreet woman as she was, she inwardly much commended the\r\ndamsel therefor,--and she said, 'How now, Jeannette? If our lord the\r\nking, who is a young cavalier, as thou art a very fair damsel, would\r\nfain have some easance of thy love, wouldst thou deny it to him?'\r\nWhereto she answered forthright, 'The king might do me violence, but\r\nof my consent he should never avail to have aught of me save what was\r\nhonourable.' The lady, seeing how she was minded, left parleying with\r\nher and bethought herself to put her to the proof; wherefore she told\r\nher son that, whenas he should be recovered, she would contrive to\r\nget her alone with him in a chamber, so he might make shift to have\r\nhis pleasure of her, saying that it appeared to her unseemly that she\r\nshould, procuress-wise, plead for her son and solicit her own maid.\r\n\r\nWith this the young man was nowise content and presently waxed\r\ngrievously worse, which when his mother saw, she opened her mind to\r\nJeannette, but, finding her more constant than ever, recounted what\r\nshe had done to her husband, and he and she resolved of one accord,\r\ngrievous though it seemed to them, to give her to him to wife,\r\nchoosing rather to have their son alive with a wife unsorted to his\r\nquality than dead without any; and so, after much parley, they did;\r\nwhereat Jeannette was exceeding content and with a devout heart\r\nrendered thanks to God, who had not forgotten her; but for all that\r\nshe never avouched herself other than the daughter of a Picard. As for\r\nthe young man, he presently recovered and celebrating his nuptials,\r\nthe gladdest man alive, proceeded to lead a merry life with his bride.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Perrot, who had been left in Wales with the King of\r\nEngland's marshal, waxed likewise in favour with his lord and grew up\r\nvery goodly of his person and doughty as any man in the island,\r\ninsomuch that neither in tourneying nor jousting nor in any other act\r\nof arms was there any in the land who could cope with him; wherefore\r\nhe was everywhere known and famous under the name of Perrot the\r\nPicard. And even as God had not forgotten his sister, so on like wise\r\nHe showed that He had him also in mind; for that a pestilential\r\nsickness, being come into those parts, carried off well nigh half the\r\npeople thereof, besides that most part of those who survived fled for\r\nfear into other lands; wherefore the whole country appeared desert. In\r\nthis mortality, the marshal his lord and his lady and only son,\r\ntogether with many others, brothers and nephews and kinsmen, all died,\r\nnor was any left of all his house save a daughter, just husband-ripe,\r\nand Perrot, with sundry other serving folk. The pestilence being\r\nsomewhat abated, the young lady, with the approof and by the counsel\r\nof some few gentlemen of the country[128] left alive, took Perrot, for\r\nthat he was a man of worth and prowess, to husband and made him lord\r\nof all that had fallen to her by inheritance; nor was it long ere the\r\nKing of England, hearing the marshal to be dead and knowing the worth\r\nof Perrot the Picard, substituted him in the dead man's room and made\r\nhim his marshal. This, in brief, is what came of the two innocent\r\nchildren of the Count of Antwerp, left by him for lost.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: _Paesani_, lit., countrymen; but Boccaccio evidently\r\nuses the word in the sense of \"vassals.\"]\r\n\r\nEighteen years were now passed since the count's flight from Paris,\r\nwhen, as he abode in Ireland, having suffered many things in a very\r\nsorry way of life, there took him a desire to learn, as he might, what\r\nwas come of his children. Wherefore, seeing himself altogether changed\r\nof favour from that which he was wont to be and feeling himself, for\r\nlong exercise, grown more robust of his person than he had been when\r\nyoung and abiding in ease and idlesse, he took leave of him with whom\r\nhe had so long abidden and came, poor and ill enough in case, to\r\nEngland. Thence he betook himself whereas he had left Perrot and found\r\nhim a marshal and a great lord and saw him robust and goodly of\r\nperson; the which was mighty pleasing unto him, but he would not make\r\nhimself known to him till he should have learned how it was with\r\nJeannette. Accordingly, he set out and stayed not till he came to\r\nLondon, where, cautiously enquiring of the lady with whom he had left\r\nhis daughter and of her condition, he found Jeannette married to her\r\nson, which greatly rejoiced him and he counted all his past adversity\r\na little thing, since he had found his children again alive and in\r\ngood case.\r\n\r\nThen, desirous of seeing Jeannette, he began beggarwise, to haunt the\r\nneighbourhood of her house, where one day Jamy Lamiens, (for so was\r\nJeannette's husband called,) espying him and having compassion on him,\r\nfor that he saw him old and poor, bade one of his servants bring him\r\nin and give him to eat for the love of God, which the man readily did.\r\nNow Jeannette had had several children by Jamy, whereof the eldest was\r\nno more than eight years old, and they were the handsomest and\r\nsprightliest children in the world. When they saw the count eat, they\r\ncame one and all about him and began to caress him, as if, moved by\r\nsome occult virtue, they divined him to be their grandfather. He,\r\nknowing them for his grandchildren, fell to fondling and making much\r\nof them, wherefore the children would not leave him, albeit he who had\r\ncharge of their governance called them. Jeannette, hearing this,\r\nissued forth of a chamber therenigh and coming whereas the count was,\r\nchid them amain and threatened to beat them, an they did not what\r\ntheir governor willed. The children began to weep and say that they\r\nwould fain abide with that honest man, who loved them better than\r\ntheir governor, whereat both the lady and the count laughed. Now the\r\nlatter had risen, nowise as a father, but as a poor man, to do honour\r\nto his daughter, as to a mistress, and seeing her, felt a marvellous\r\npleasure at his heart. But she nor then nor after knew him any whit,\r\nfor that he was beyond measure changed from what he was used to be,\r\nbeing grown old and hoar and bearded and lean and swart, and appeared\r\naltogether another man than the count.\r\n\r\nThe lady then, seeing that the children were unwilling to leave him\r\nand wept, when she would have them go away, bade their governor let\r\nthem be awhile and the children thus being with the good man, it\r\nchanced that Jamy's father returned and heard from their governor what\r\nhad passed, whereupon quoth the marshal, who held Jeannette in\r\ndespite, 'Let them be, God give them ill-luck! They do but hark back\r\nto that whence they sprang. They come by their mother of a vagabond\r\nand therefore it is no wonder if they are fain to herd with\r\nvagabonds.' The count heard these words and was mightily chagrined\r\nthereat; nevertheless, he shrugged his shoulders and put up with the\r\naffront, even as he had put up with many others. Jamy, hearing how the\r\nchildren had welcomed the honest man, to wit, the count, albeit it\r\nmisliked him, nevertheless so loved them that, rather than see them\r\nweep, he commanded that, if the good man chose to abide there in any\r\ncapacity, he should be received into his service. The count answered\r\nthat he would gladly abide there, but he knew not to do aught other\r\nthan tend horses, whereto he had been used all his lifetime. A horse\r\nwas accordingly assigned to him and when he had cared for it, he\r\nbusied himself with making sport for the children.\r\n\r\nWhilst fortune handled the Count of Antwerp and his children on such\r\nwise as hath been set out, it befell that the King of France, after\r\nmany truces made with the Germans, died and his son, whose wife was\r\nshe through whom the count had been banished, was crowned in his\r\nplace; and no sooner was the current truce expired than he again began\r\na very fierce war. To his aid the King of England, as a new-made\r\nkinsman, despatched much people, under the commandment of Perrot his\r\nmarshal and Jamy Lamiens, son of the other marshal, and with them went\r\nthe good man, to wit, the count, who, without being recognized of any,\r\nabode a pretty while with the army in the guise of a horseboy, and\r\nthere, like a man of mettle as he was, wrought good galore, more than\r\nwas required of him, both with counsels and with deeds.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, it came to pass that the Queen of France fell\r\ngrievously sick and feeling herself nigh unto death, contrite for all\r\nher sins, confessed herself unto the Archbishop of Rouen, who was held\r\nof all a very holy and good man. Amongst her other sins, she related\r\nto him that which the Count of Antwerp had most wrongfully suffered\r\nthrough her; nor was she content to tell it to him alone, nay, but\r\nbefore many other men of worth she recounted all as it had passed,\r\nbeseeching them so to do with the king that the count, an he were on\r\nlife, or, if not, one of his children, should be restored to his\r\nestate; after which she lingered not long, but, departing this life,\r\nwas honourably buried. Her confession, being reported to the king,\r\nmoved him, after he had heaved divers sighs of regret for the wrong\r\ndone to the nobleman, to let cry throughout all the army and in many\r\nother parts, that whoso should give him news of the Count of Antwerp\r\nor of either of his children should for each be wonder-well guerdoned\r\nof him, for that he held him, upon the queen's confession, innocent of\r\nthat for which he had gone into exile and was minded to restore him to\r\nhis first estate and more.\r\n\r\nThe count, in his guise of a horseboy, hearing this and being assured\r\nthat it was the truth,[129] betook himself forthright to Jamy Lamiens\r\nand prayed him go with him to Perrot, for that he had a mind to\r\ndiscover to them that which the king went seeking. All three being\r\nthen met together, quoth the count to Perrot, who had it already in\r\nmind to discover himself, 'Perrot, Jamy here hath thy sister to wife\r\nnor ever had any dowry with her; wherefore, that thy sister may not go\r\nundowered, I purpose that he and none other shall, by making thee\r\nknown as the son of the Count of Antwerp, have this great reward that\r\nthe king promiseth for thee and for Violante, thy sister and his wife,\r\nand myself, who am the Count of Antwerp and your father.' Perrot,\r\nhearing this and looking steadfastly upon him, presently knew him and\r\ncast himself, weeping, at his feet and embraced him, saying, 'Father\r\nmine, you are dearly welcome.' Jamy, hearing first what the count\r\nsaid and after seeing what Perrot did, was overcome at once with such\r\nwonderment and such gladness that he scarce knew what he should do.\r\nHowever, after awhile, giving credence to the former's speech and sore\r\nashamed for the injurious words he had whiles used to the\r\nhostler-count, he let himself fall, weeping, at his feet and humbly\r\nbesought him pardon of every past affront, the which the count, having\r\nraised him to his feet, graciously accorded him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: _i.e._ that it was not a snare.]\r\n\r\nThen, after they had all three discoursed awhile of each one's various\r\nadventures and wept and rejoiced together amain, Perrot and Jamy would\r\nhave reclad the count, who would on nowise suffer it, but willed that\r\nJamy, having first assured himself of the promised guerdon, should,\r\nthe more to shame the king, present him to the latter in that his then\r\nplight and in his groom's habit. Accordingly, Jamy, followed by the\r\ncount and Perrot, presented himself before the king, and offered,\r\nprovided he would guerdon him according to the proclamation made, to\r\nproduce to him the count and his children. The king promptly let bring\r\nfor all three a guerdon marvellous in Jamy's eyes and commanded that\r\nhe should be free to carry it off, whenas he should in very deed\r\nproduce the count and his children, as he promised. Jamy, then,\r\nturning himself about and putting forward the count his horseboy and\r\nPerrot, said, 'My lord, here be the father and the son; the daughter,\r\nwho is my wife and who is not here, with God's aid you shall soon\r\nsee.'\r\n\r\nThe king, hearing this, looked at the count and albeit he was sore\r\nchanged from that which he was used to be, yet, after he had awhile\r\nconsidered him, he knew him and well nigh with tears in his eyes\r\nraised him--for that he was on his knees before him--to his feet and\r\nkissed and embraced him. Perrot, also, he graciously received and\r\ncommanded that the count should incontinent be furnished anew with\r\nclothes and servants and horses and harness, according as his quality\r\nrequired, which was straightway done. Moreover, he entreated Jamy with\r\nexceeding honour and would fain know every particular of his[130] past\r\nadventures. Then, Jamy being about to receive the magnificent guerdons\r\nappointed him for having discovered the count and his children, the\r\nformer said to him, 'Take these of the munificence of our lord the\r\nking and remember to tell thy father that thy children, his\r\ngrandchildren and mine, are not by their mother born of a vagabond.'\r\nJamy, accordingly, took the gifts and sent for his wife and mother to\r\nParis, whither came also Perrot's wife; and there they all\r\nforegathered in the utmost joyance with the count, whom the king had\r\nreinstated in all his good and made greater than he ever was. Then\r\nall, with Gautier's leave, returned to their several homes and he\r\nuntil his death abode in Paris more worshipfully than ever.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: _Quære_, the Count's?]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NINTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Second]\r\n\r\n     BERNABO OF GENOA, DUPED BY AMBROGIUOLO, LOSETH HIS GOOD AND\r\n     COMMANDETH THAT HIS INNOCENT WIFE BE PUT TO DEATH. SHE\r\n     ESCAPETH AND SERVETH THE SOLDAN IN A MAN'S HABIT. HERE SHE\r\n     LIGHTETH UPON THE DECEIVER OF HER HUSBAND AND BRINGETH THE\r\n     LATTER TO ALEXANDRIA, WHERE, HER TRADUCER BEING PUNISHED,\r\n     SHE RESUMETH WOMAN'S APPAREL AND RETURNETH TO GENOA WITH HER\r\n     HUSBAND, RICH\r\n\r\n\r\nElisa having furnished her due with her pitiful story, Filomena the\r\nqueen, who was tall and goodly of person and smiling and agreeable of\r\naspect beyond any other of her sex, collecting herself, said, \"Needs\r\nmust the covenant with Dioneo be observed, wherefore, there remaining\r\nnone other to tell than he and I, I will tell my story first, and he,\r\nfor that he asked it as a favour, shall be the last to speak.\" So\r\nsaying, she began thus, \"There is a proverb oftentimes cited among the\r\ncommon folk to the effect that the deceiver abideth[131] at the feet\r\nof the deceived; the which meseemeth may by no reasoning be shown to\r\nbe true, an it approve not itself by actual occurrences. Wherefore,\r\nwhilst ensuing the appointed theme, it hath occurred to me, dearest\r\nladies, to show you, at the same time, that this is true, even as it\r\nis said; nor should it mislike you to hear it, so you may know how to\r\nkeep yourselves from deceivers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: _Rimane._ The verb _rimanere_ is constantly used by the\r\nold Italian writers in the sense of \"to become,\" so that the proverb\r\ncited in the text may be read \"The deceiver becometh (_i.e._ findeth\r\nhimself in the end) at the feet (_i.e._ at the mercy) of the person\r\ndeceived.\"]\r\n\r\nThere were once at Paris in an inn certain very considerable Italian\r\nmerchants, who were come thither, according to their usance, some on\r\none occasion and some on another, and having one evening among others\r\nsupped all together merrily, they fell to devising of divers matters,\r\nand passing from one discourse to another, they came at last to speak\r\nof their wives, whom they had left at home, and one said jestingly, 'I\r\nknow not how mine doth; but this I know well, that, whenas there\r\ncometh to my hand here any lass that pleaseth me, I leave on one side\r\nthe love I bear my wife and take of the other such pleasure as I may.'\r\n'And I,' quoth another, 'do likewise, for that if I believe that my\r\nwife pusheth her fortunes [in my absence,] she doth it, and if I\r\nbelieve it not, still she doth it; wherefore tit for tat be it; an ass\r\nstill getteth as good as he giveth.'[132] A third, following on, came\r\nwell nigh to the same conclusion, and in brief all seemed agreed upon\r\nthis point, that the wives they left behind had no mind to lose time\r\nin their husbands' absence. One only, who hight Bernabo Lomellini of\r\nGenoa, maintained the contrary, avouching that he, by special grace of\r\nGod, had a lady to wife who was belike the most accomplished woman of\r\nall Italy in all those qualities which a lady, nay, even (in great\r\npart) in those which a knight or an esquire, should have; for that she\r\nwas fair of favour and yet in her first youth and adroit and robust of\r\nher person; nor was there aught that pertaineth unto a woman, such as\r\nworks of broidery in silk and the like, but she did it better than any\r\nother of her sex. Moreover, said he, there was no sewer, or in other\r\nwords, no serving-man, alive who served better or more deftly at a\r\nnobleman's table than did she, for that she was very well bred and\r\nexceeding wise and discreet. He after went on to extol her as knowing\r\nbetter how to ride a horse and fly a hawk, to read and write and cast\r\na reckoning than if she were a merchant; and thence, after many other\r\ncommendations, coming to that whereof it had been discoursed among\r\nthem, he avouched with an oath that there could be found no honester\r\nnor chaster woman than she; wherefore he firmly believed that, should\r\nhe abide half a score years, or even always, from home, she would\r\nnever incline to the least levity with another man. Among the\r\nmerchants who discoursed thus was a young man called Ambrogiuolo of\r\nPiacenza, who fell to making the greatest mock in the world of this\r\nlast commendation bestowed by Bernabo upon his wife and asked him\r\nscoffingly if the emperor had granted him that privilege over and\r\nabove all other men. Bernabo, some little nettled, replied that not\r\nthe emperor, but God, who could somewhat more than the emperor, had\r\nvouchsafed him the favour in question. Whereupon quoth Ambrogiuolo,\r\n'Bernabo, I doubt not a whit but that thou thinkest to say sooth; but\r\nmeseemeth thou hast paid little regard to the nature of things; for\r\nthat, hadst thou taken heed thereunto, I deem thee not so dull of wit\r\nbut thou wouldst have noted therein certain matters which had made\r\nthee speak more circumspectly on this subject. And that thou mayst not\r\nthink that we, who have spoken much at large of our wives, believe\r\nthat we have wives other or otherwise made than thine, but mayst see\r\nthat we spoke thus, moved by natural perception, I will e'en reason\r\nwith thee a little on this matter. I have always understood man to be\r\nthe noblest animal created of God among mortals, and after him, woman;\r\nbut man, as is commonly believed and as is seen by works, is the more\r\nperfect and having more perfection, must without fail have more of\r\nfirmness and constancy, for that women universally are more\r\nchangeable; the reason whereof might be shown by many natural\r\narguments, which for the present I purpose to leave be. If then man be\r\nof more stability and yet cannot keep himself, let alone from\r\ncomplying with a woman who soliciteth him, but even from desiring one\r\nwho pleaseth him, nay more, from doing what he can, so he may avail to\r\nbe with her,--and if this betide him not once a month, but a thousand\r\ntimes a day,--what canst thou expect a woman, naturally unstable, to\r\navail against the prayers, the blandishments, the gifts and a thousand\r\nother means which an adroit man, who loveth her, will use? Thinkest\r\nthou she can hold out? Certes, how much soever thou mayst affirm it,\r\nI believe not that thou believest it; and thou thyself sayst that thy\r\nwife is a woman and that she is of flesh and blood, as are other\r\nwomen. If this be so, those same desires must be hers and the same\r\npowers that are in other women to resist these natural appetites;\r\nwherefore, however honest she be, it is possible she may do that which\r\nother women do; and nothing that is possible she be so peremptorily\r\ndenied nor the contrary thereof affirmed with such rigour as thou\r\ndost.' To which Bernabo made answer, saying, 'I am a merchant, and not\r\na philosopher, and as a merchant I will answer; and I say that I\r\nacknowledge that what thou sayst may happen to foolish women in whom\r\nthere is no shame; but those who are discreet are so careful of their\r\nhonour that for the guarding thereof they become stronger than men,\r\nwho reck not of this; and of those thus fashioned is my wife.'\r\n'Indeed,' rejoined Ambrogiuolo, 'if, for every time they occupy\r\nthemselves with toys of this kind, there sprouted from their foreheads\r\na horn to bear witness of that which they have done, there be few, I\r\nbelieve, who would incline thereto; but, far from the horn sprouting,\r\nthere appeareth neither trace nor token thereof in those who are\r\ndiscreet, and shame and soil of honour consist not but in things\r\ndiscovered; wherefore, whenas they may secretly, they do it, or, if\r\nthey forebear, it is for stupidity. And have thou this for certain\r\nthat she alone is chaste, who hath either never been solicited of any\r\nor who, having herself solicited, hath not been hearkened. And\r\nalthough I know by natural and true reasons that it is e'en as I say,\r\nyet should I not speak thereof with so full an assurance, had I not\r\nmany a time and with many women made essay thereof. And this I tell\r\nthee, that, were I near this most sanctified wife of thine, I warrant\r\nme I would in brief space of time bring her to that which I have\r\nalready gotten of other women.' Whereupon quoth Bernabo, 'Disputing\r\nwith words might be prolonged without end; thou wouldst say and I\r\nshould say, and in the end it would all amount to nothing. But, since\r\nthou wilt have it that all women are so compliant and that thine\r\naddress is such, I am content, so I may certify thee of my wife's\r\nhonesty, to have my head cut off, and thou canst anywise avail to\r\nbring her to do thy pleasure in aught of the kind; and if thou fail\r\nthereof, I will have thee lose no otherwhat than a thousand gold\r\nflorins.' 'Bernabo,' replied Ambrogiuolo, who was now grown heated\r\nover the dispute, 'I know not what I should do with thy blood, if I\r\nwon the wager; but, an thou have a mind to see proof of that which I\r\nhave advanced, do thou stake five thousand gold florins of thy monies,\r\nwhich should be less dear to thee than thy head, against a thousand of\r\nmine, and whereas thou settest no limit [of time,] I will e'en bind\r\nmyself to go to Genoa and within three months from the day of my\r\ndeparture hence to have done my will of thy wife and to bring back\r\nwith me, in proof thereof, sundry of her most precious things and such\r\nand so many tokens that thou shalt thyself confess it to be truth, so\r\nverily thou wilt pledge me thy faith not to come to Genoa within that\r\nterm nor write her aught of the matter.' Bernabo said that it liked\r\nhim well and albeit the other merchants endeavoured to hinder the\r\naffair, foreseeing that sore mischief might come thereof, the two\r\nmerchants' minds were so inflamed that, in despite of the rest, they\r\nbound themselves one to other by express writings under their hands.\r\nThis done, Bernabo abode behind, whilst Ambrogiuolo, as quickliest he\r\nmight, betook himself to Genoa. There he abode some days and informing\r\nhimself with the utmost precaution of the name of the street where the\r\nlady dwelt and of her manner of life, understood of her that and more\r\nthan that which he had heard of her from Bernabo, wherefore himseemed\r\nhe was come on a fool's errand. However, he presently clapped up an\r\nacquaintance with a poor woman, who was much about the house and whose\r\ngreat well-wisher the lady was, and availing not to induce her to\r\naught else, he debauched her with money and prevailed with her to\r\nbring him, in a chest wroughten after a fashion of his own, not only\r\ninto the house, but into the gentlewoman's very bedchamber, where,\r\naccording to the ordinance given her of him, the good woman commended\r\nit to her care for some days, as if she had a mind to go somewhither.\r\nThe chest, then being left in the chamber and the night come,\r\nAmbrogiuolo, what time he judged the lady to be asleep, opened the\r\nchest with certain engines of his and came softly out into the\r\nchamber, where there was a light burning, with whose aid he proceeded\r\nto observe the ordinance of the place, the paintings and every other\r\nnotable thing that was therein and fixed them in his memory. Then,\r\ndrawing near the bed and perceiving that the lady and a little girl,\r\nwho was with her, were fast asleep, he softly altogether uncovered the\r\nformer and found that she was as fair, naked, as clad, but saw no sign\r\nabout her that he might carry away, save one, to wit, a mole which she\r\nhad under the left pap and about which were sundry little hairs as red\r\nas gold. This noted he covered her softly up again, albeit, seeing her\r\nso fair, he was tempted to adventure his life and lay himself by her\r\nside; however, for that he had heard her to be so obdurate and\r\nuncomplying in matters of this kind, he hazarded not himself, but,\r\nabiding at his leisure in the chamber the most part of the night, took\r\nfrom one of her coffers a purse and a night-rail, together with sundry\r\nrings and girdles, and laying them all in his chest, returned thither\r\nhimself and shut himself up therein as before; and on this wise he did\r\ntwo nights, without the lady being ware of aught. On the third day the\r\ngood woman came back for the chest, according to the given ordinance,\r\nand carried it off whence she had taken it, whereupon Ambrogiuolo came\r\nout and having rewarded her according to promise, returned, as\r\nquickliest he might, with the things aforesaid, to Paris, where he\r\narrived before the term appointed. There he summoned the merchants who\r\nhad been present at the dispute and the laying of the wager and\r\ndeclared, in Bernabo's presence, that he had won the wager laid\r\nbetween them, for that he had accomplished that whereof he had vaunted\r\nhimself; and to prove this to be true, he first described the fashion\r\nof the chamber and the paintings thereof and after showed the things\r\nhe had brought with him thence, avouching that he had them of herself.\r\nBernabo confessed the chamber to be as he had said and owned,\r\nmoreover, that he recognized the things in question as being in truth\r\nhis wife's; but said that he might have learned from one of the\r\nservants of the house the fashion of the chamber and have gotten the\r\nthings in like manner; wherefore, an he had nought else to say,\r\nhimseemed not that this should suffice to prove him to have won.\r\nWhereupon quoth Ambrogiuolo, 'In sooth this should suffice, but, since\r\nthou wilt have me say more, I will say it. I tell thee that Madam\r\nGinevra thy wife hath under her left pap a pretty big mole, about\r\nwhich are maybe half a dozen little hairs as red as gold.' When\r\nBernabo heard this, it was as if he had gotten a knife-thrust in the\r\nheart, such anguish did he feel, and though he had said not a word,\r\nhis countenance, being all changed, gave very manifest token that what\r\nAmbrogiuolo said was true. Then, after awhile, 'Gentlemen,' quoth he,\r\n'that which Ambrogiuolo saith is true; wherefore, he having won, let\r\nhim come whenassoever it pleaseth him and he shall be paid.'\r\nAccordingly, on the ensuing day Ambrogiuolo was paid in full and\r\nBernabo, departing Paris, betook himself to Genoa with fell intent\r\nagainst the lady. When he drew near the city, he would not enter\r\ntherein, but lighted down a good score miles away at a country house\r\nof his and despatched one of his servants, in whom he much trusted, to\r\nGenoa with two horses and letters under his hand, advising his wife\r\nthat he had returned and bidding her come to him; and he privily\r\ncharged the man, whenas he should be with the lady in such place as\r\nshould seem best to him, to put her to death without pity and return\r\nto him. The servant accordingly repaired to Genoa and delivering the\r\nletters and doing his errand, was received with great rejoicing by the\r\nlady, who on the morrow took horse with him and set out for their\r\ncountry house. As they fared on together, discoursing of one thing and\r\nanother, they came to a very deep and lonely valley, beset with high\r\nrocks and trees, which seeming to the servant a place wherein he\r\nmight, with assurance for himself, do his lord's commandment, he\r\npulled out his knife and taking the lady by the arm, said, 'Madam,\r\ncommend your soul to God, for needs must you die, without faring\r\nfarther.' The lady, seeing the knife and hearing these words, was all\r\ndismayed and said, 'Mercy, for God's sake! Ere thou slay me, tell me\r\nwherein I have offended thee, that thou wouldst put me to death.'\r\n'Madam,' answered the man, 'me you have nowise offended; but wherein\r\nyou have offended your husband I know not, save that he hath commanded\r\nme slay you by the way, without having any pity upon you, threatening\r\nme, an I did it not, to have me hanged by the neck. You know well how\r\nmuch I am beholden to him and how I may not gainsay him in aught that\r\nhe may impose upon me; God knoweth it irketh me for you, but I can no\r\notherwise.' Whereupon quoth the lady, weeping, 'Alack, for God's sake,\r\nconsent not to become the murderer of one who hath never wronged thee,\r\nto serve another! God who knoweth all knoweth that I never did aught\r\nfor which I should receive such a recompense from my husband. But let\r\nthat be; thou mayst, an thou wilt, at once content God and thy master\r\nand me, on this wise; to wit, that thou take these my clothes and give\r\nme but thy doublet and a hood and with the former return to my lord\r\nand thine and tell him that thou hast slain me; and I swear to thee,\r\nby that life which thou wilt have bestowed on me, that I will remove\r\nhence and get me gone into a country whence never shall any news of me\r\nwin either to him or to thee or into these parts.' The servant, who\r\nwas loath to slay her, was lightly moved to compassion; wherefore he\r\ntook her clothes and give her a sorry doublet of his and a hood,\r\nleaving her sundry monies she had with her. Then praying her depart\r\nthe country, he left her in the valley and afoot and betook himself to\r\nhis master, to whom he avouched that not only was his commandment\r\naccomplished, but that he had left the lady's dead body among a pack\r\nof wolves, and Bernabo presently returned to Genoa, where the thing\r\nbecoming known, he was much blamed. As for the lady, she abode alone\r\nand disconsolate till nightfall, when she disguised herself as most\r\nshe might and repaired to a village hard by, where, having gotten from\r\nan old woman that which she needed, she fitted the doublet to her\r\nshape and shortening it, made a pair of linen breeches of her shift;\r\nthen, having cut her hair and altogether transformed herself in the\r\nguise of a sailor, she betook herself to the sea-shore, where, as\r\nchance would have it, she found a Catalan gentleman, by name Senor\r\nEncararch, who had landed at Alba from a ship he had in the offing, to\r\nrefresh himself at a spring there. With him she entered into parley\r\nand engaging with him as a servant, embarked on board the ship, under\r\nthe name of Sicurano da Finale. There, being furnished by the\r\ngentleman with better clothes, she proceeded to serve him so well and\r\nso aptly that she became in the utmost favour with him. No great while\r\nafter it befell that the Catalan made a voyage to Alexandria with a\r\nlading of his and carrying thither certain peregrine falcons for the\r\nSoldan, presented them to him. The Soldan, having once and again\r\nentertained him at meat and noting with approof the fashions of\r\nSicurano, who still went serving him, begged him[133] of his master,\r\nwho yielded him to him, although it irked him to do it, and Sicurano,\r\nin a little while, by his good behaviour, gained the love and favour\r\nof the Soldan, even as he had gained that of the Catalan. Wherefore,\r\nin process of time, it befell that,--the time coming for a great\r\nassemblage, in the guise of a fair, of merchants, both Christian and\r\nSaracen, which was wont at a certain season of the year to be held in\r\nAcre, a town under the seignory of the Soldan, and to which, in order\r\nthat the merchants and their merchandise might rest secure, the latter\r\nwas still used to despatch, besides other his officers, some one of\r\nhis chief men, with troops, to look to the guard,--he bethought\r\nhimself to send Sicurano, who was by this well versed in the language\r\nof the country, on this service; and so he did. Sicurano accordingly\r\ncame to Acre as governor and captain of the guard of the merchants and\r\ntheir merchandise and there well and diligently doing that which\r\npertained to his office and going round looking about him, saw many\r\nmerchants there, Sicilians and Pisans and Genoese and Venetians and\r\nother Italians, with whom he was fain to make acquaintance, in\r\nremembrance of his country. It befell, one time amongst others, that,\r\nhaving lighted down at the shop of certain Venetian merchants, he\r\nespied among other trinkets, a purse and a girdle, which he\r\nstraightway knew for having been his and marvelled thereat; but,\r\nwithout making any sign, he carelessly asked to whom they pertained\r\nand if they were for sale. Now Ambrogiuolo of Piacenza was come\r\nthither with much merchandise on board a Venetian ship and hearing the\r\ncaptain of the guard ask whose the trinkets were, came forward and\r\nsaid, laughing, 'Sir, the things are mine and I do not sell them; but,\r\nif they please you, I will gladly give them to you.' Sicurano, seeing\r\nhim laugh, misdoubted he had recognized him by some gesture of his;\r\nbut yet, keeping a steady countenance, he said, 'Belike thou laughest\r\nto see me, a soldier, go questioning of these women's toys?' 'Sir,'\r\nanswered Ambrogiuolo, 'I laugh not at that; nay, but at the way I came\r\nby them.' 'Marry, then,' said Sicurano, 'an it be not unspeakable,\r\ntell me how thou gottest them, so God give thee good luck.' Quoth\r\nAmbrogiuolo, 'Sir, a gentlewoman of Genoa, hight Madam Ginevra, wife\r\nof Bernabo Lomellini, gave me these things, with certain others, one\r\nnight that I lay with her, and prayed me keep them for the love of\r\nher. Now I laugh for that I mind me of the simplicity of Bernabo, who\r\nwas fool enough to lay five thousand florins to one that I would not\r\nbring his wife to do my pleasure; the which I did and won the wager;\r\nwhereupon he, who should rather have punished himself for his\r\nstupidity than her for doing that which all women do, returned from\r\nParis to Genoa and there, by what I have since heard, caused her put\r\nto death.' Sicurano, hearing this, understood forthwith what was the\r\ncause of Bernabo's anger against his wife[134] and manifestly\r\nperceiving this fellow to have been the occasion of all her ills,\r\ndetermined not to let him go unpunished therefor. Accordingly he\r\nfeigned to be greatly diverted with the story and artfully clapped up\r\na strait acquaintance with him, insomuch that, the fair being ended,\r\nAmbrogiuolo, at his instance, accompanied him, with all his good, to\r\nAlexandria. Here Sicurano let build him a warehouse and lodged in his\r\nhands store of his own monies; and Ambrogiuolo, foreseeing great\r\nadvantage to himself, willingly took up his abode there. Meanwhile,\r\nSicurano, careful to make Bernabo clear of his[135] innocence, rested\r\nnot till, by means of certain great Genoese merchants who were then in\r\nAlexandria, he had, on some plausible occasion of his[136] own\r\ndevising, caused him come thither, where finding him in poor enough\r\ncase, he had him privily entertained by a friend of his[137] against\r\nit should seem to him[138] time to do that which he purposed. Now he\r\nhad already made Ambrogiuolo recount his story before the Soldan for\r\nthe latter's diversion; but seeing Bernabo there and thinking there\r\nwas no need to use farther delay in the matter, he took occasion to\r\nprocure the Soldan to have Ambrogiuolo and Bernabo brought before him\r\nand in the latter's presence, to extort from the former, by dint of\r\nseverity, an it might not easily be done [by other means,] the truth\r\nof that whereof he vaunted himself concerning Bernabo's wife.\r\nAccordingly, they both being come, the Soldan, in the presence of\r\nmany, with a stern countenance commanded Ambrogiuolo to tell the truth\r\nhow he had won of Bernabo the five thousand gold florins; and Sicurano\r\nhimself, in whom he most trusted, with a yet angrier aspect,\r\nthreatened him with the most grievous torments, an he told it not;\r\nwhereupon Ambrogiuolo, affrighted on one side and another and in a\r\nmeasure constrained, in the presence of Bernabo and many others,\r\nplainly related everything, even as it passed, expecting no worse\r\npunishment therefor than the restitution of the five thousand gold\r\nflorins and of the stolen trinkets. He having spoken, Sicurano, as he\r\nwere the Soldan's minister in the matter, turned to Bernabo and said\r\nto him, 'And thou, what didst thou to thy lady for this lie?' Whereto\r\nBernabo replied, 'Overcome with wrath for the loss of my money and\r\nwith resentment for the shame which meseemed I had gotten from my\r\nwife, I caused a servant of mine put her to death, and according to\r\nthat which he reported to me, she was straightway devoured by a\r\nmultitude of wolves,' These things said in the presence of the Soldan\r\nand all heard and apprehended of him, albeit he knew not yet to what\r\nend Sicurano, who had sought and ordered this, would fain come, the\r\nlatter said to him, 'My lord, you may very clearly see how much reason\r\nyonder poor lady had to vaunt herself of her gallant and her husband,\r\nfor that the former at once bereaved her of honour, marring her fair\r\nfame with lies, and despoiled her husband, whilst the latter more\r\ncredulous of others' falsehoods than of the truth which he might by\r\nlong experience have known, caused her to be slain and eaten of\r\nwolves; and moreover, such is the goodwill and the love borne her by\r\nthe one and the other that, having long abidden with her, neither of\r\nthem knoweth her. But that you may the better apprehend that which\r\neach of these hath deserved, I will,--so but you vouchsafe me, of\r\nspecial favour to punish the deceiver and pardon the dupe,--e'en cause\r\nher come hither into your and their presence.' The Soldan, disposed in\r\nthe matter altogether to comply with Sicurano's wishes, answered that\r\nhe would well and bade him produce the lady; whereat Bernabo marvelled\r\nexceedingly, for that he firmly believed her to be dead, whilst\r\nAmbrogiuolo, now divining his danger, began to be in fear of worse\r\nthan paying of monies and knew not whether more to hope or to fear\r\nfrom the coming of the lady, but awaited her appearance with the\r\nutmost amazement. The Soldan, then, having accorded Sicurano his wish,\r\nthe latter threw himself, weeping, on his knees before him and putting\r\noff, as it were at one and the same time, his manly voice and\r\nmasculine demeanour, said, 'My lord, I am the wretched misfortunate\r\nGinevra, who have these six years gone wandering in man's disguise\r\nabout the world, having been foully and wickedly aspersed by this\r\ntraitor Ambrogiuolo and given by yonder cruel and unjust man to one\r\nof his servants to be slain and eaten of wolves.' Then, tearing open\r\nthe fore part of her clothes and showing her breast, she discovered\r\nherself to the Soldan and all else who were present and after, turning\r\nto Ambrogiuolo, indignantly demanded of him when he had ever lain with\r\nher, according as he had aforetime boasted; but he, now knowing her\r\nand fallen well nigh dumb for shame, said nothing. The Soldan, who had\r\nalways held her a man, seeing and hearing this, fell into such a\r\nwonderment that he more than once misdoubted that which he saw and\r\nheard to be rather a dream than true. However, after his amazement had\r\nabated, apprehending the truth of the matter, he lauded to the utmost\r\nthe life and fashions of Ginevra, till then called Sicurano, and\r\nextolled her constancy and virtue; and letting bring her very\r\nsumptuous woman's apparel and women to attend her, he pardoned\r\nBernabo, in accordance with her request, the death he had merited,\r\nwhilst the latter, recognizing her, cast himself at her feet, weeping\r\nand craving forgiveness, which she, ill worthy as he was thereof,\r\ngraciously accorded him and raising him to his feet, embraced him\r\ntenderly, as her husband. Then the Soldan commanded that Ambrogiuolo\r\nshould incontinent be bound to a stake and smeared with honey and\r\nexposed to the sun in some high place of the city, nor should ever be\r\nloosed thence till such time as he should fall of himself; and so was\r\nit done. After this he commanded that all that had belonged to him\r\nshould be given to the lady, the which was not so little but that it\r\noutvalued ten thousand doubloons. Moreover, he let make a very goodly\r\nbanquet, wherein he entertained Bernabo with honour, as Madam\r\nGinevra's husband, and herself as a very valiant lady and gave her, in\r\njewels and vessels of gold and silver and monies, that which amounted\r\nto better[139] than other ten thousand doubloons. Then, the banquet\r\nover, he caused equip them a ship and gave them leave to return at\r\ntheir pleasure to Genoa, whither accordingly they returned with great\r\njoyance and exceeding rich; and there they were received with the\r\nutmost honour, especially Madam Ginevra, who was of all believed to be\r\ndead and who, while she lived, was still reputed of great worth and\r\nvirtue. As for Ambrogiuolo, being that same day bounded to the stake\r\nand anointed with honey, he was, to his exceeding torment, not only\r\nslain, but devoured, of the flies and wasps and gadflies, wherewith\r\nthat country aboundeth, even to the bones, which latter, waxed white\r\nand hanging by the sinews, being left unremoved, long bore witness of\r\nhis villainy to all who saw them. And on this wise did the deceiver\r\nabide at the feet of the deceived.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: Lit.

In telling you this story, I shall at once show you how\r\ngreat is the folly of these folk and how greater yet is that of those\r\nwho, deeming themselves more potent than nature herself, think by dint\r\nof sophistical inventions[140] to avail unto that which is beyond\r\ntheir power and study to bring others to that which they themselves\r\nare, whenas the complexion of those on whom they practise brooketh it\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: Lit. fabulous demonstrations (_dimostrazioni\r\nfavolose_), casuistical arguments, founded upon premises of their own\r\ninvention.]\r\n\r\nThere was, then, in Pisa a judge, by name Messer Ricciardo di\r\nChinzica, more gifted with wit than with bodily strength, who,\r\nthinking belike to satisfy a wife by the same means which served him\r\nto despatch his studies and being very rich, sought with no little\r\ndiligence to have a fair and young lady to wife; whereas, had he but\r\nknown to counsel himself as he counselled others, he should have\r\nshunned both the one and the other. The thing came to pass according\r\nto his wish, for Messer Lotto Gualandi gave him to wife a daughter of\r\nhis, Bartolomea by name, one of the fairest and handsomest young\r\nladies of Pisa, albeit there be few there that are not very lizards to\r\nlook upon. The judge accordingly brought her home with the utmost pomp\r\nand having held a magnificent wedding, made shift the first night to\r\nhand her one venue for the consummation of the marriage, but came\r\nwithin an ace of making a stalemate of it, whereafter, lean and dry\r\nand scant of wind as he was, it behoved him on the morrow bring\r\nhimself back to life with malmsey and restorative confections and\r\nother remedies. Thenceforward, being now a better judge of his own\r\npowers than he was, he fell to teaching his wife a calendar fit for\r\nchildren learning to read and belike made aforetime at Ravenna,[141]\r\nfor that, according to what he feigned to her, there was no day in the\r\nyear but was sacred not to one saint only, but to many, in reverence\r\nof whom he showed by divers reasons that man and wife should abstain\r\nfrom carnal conversation; and to these be added, to boot, fast days\r\nand Emberdays and the vigils of the Apostles and of a thousand other\r\nsaints and Fridays and Saturdays and Lord's Day and all Lent and\r\ncertain seasons of the moon and store of other exceptions, conceiving\r\nbelike that it behoved to keep holiday with women in bed like as he\r\ndid bytimes whilst pleading in the courts of civil law. This fashion\r\n(to the no small chagrin of the lady, whom he handled maybe once a\r\nmonth, and hardly that) he followed a great while, still keeping\r\nstrait watch over her, lest peradventure some other should teach her\r\nto know working-days, even as he had taught her holidays. Things\r\nstanding thus, it chanced that, the heat being great and Messer\r\nRicciardo having a mind to go a-pleasuring to a very fair country-seat\r\nhe had, near Monte Nero, and there abide some days to take the air, he\r\nbetook himself thither, carrying with him his fair lady. There\r\nsojourning, to give her some diversion, he caused one day fish and\r\nthey went out to sea in two boats, he in one with the fishermen, and\r\nshe in another with other ladies. The sport luring them on, they\r\ndrifted some miles out to sea, well nigh without perceiving it, and\r\nwhilst they were intent upon their diversion, there came up of a\r\nsudden a galliot belonging to Paganino da Mare, a famous corsair of\r\nthose days. The latter, espying the boats, made for them, nor could\r\nthey flee so fast but he overtook that in which were the women and\r\nseeing therein the judge's fair lady, he carried her aboard the\r\ngalliot, in full sight of Messer Ricciardo, who was now come to land,\r\nand made off without recking of aught else. When my lord judge, who\r\nwas so jealous that he misdoubted of the very air, saw this, it\r\nbooteth not to ask if he was chagrined; and in vain, both at Pisa and\r\notherwhere, did he complain of the villainy of the corsairs, for that\r\nhe knew not who had taken his wife from him nor whither he had carried\r\nher. As for Paganino, finding her so fair, he deemed himself in luck\r\nand having no wife, resolved to keep her for himself. Accordingly,\r\nseeing her weeping sore, he studied to comfort her with soft words\r\ntill nightfall, when, his calendar having dropped from his girdle and\r\nsaints' days and holidays gone clean out of his head, he fell to\r\ncomforting her with deeds, himseeming that words had availed little by\r\nday; and after such a fashion did he console her that, ere they came\r\nto Monaco, the judge and his ordinances had altogether escaped her\r\nmind and she began to lead the merriest of lives with Paganino. The\r\nlatter carried her to Monaco and there, over and above the\r\nconsolations with which he plied her night and day, he entreated her\r\nhonourably as his wife. After awhile it came to Messer Ricciardo's\r\nears where his wife was and he, being possessed with the most ardent\r\ndesire to have her again and bethinking himself that none other might\r\nthoroughly suffice to do what was needful to that end, resolved to go\r\nthither himself, determined to spend any quantity of money for her\r\nransom. Accordingly he set out by sea and coming to Monaco, there both\r\nsaw and was seen of the lady, who told it to Paganino that same\r\nevening and acquainted him with her intent. Next morning Messer\r\nRicciardo, seeing Paganino, accosted him and quickly clapped up a\r\ngreat familiarity and friendship with him, whilst the other feigned\r\nnot to know him and waited to see at what he aimed. Accordingly,\r\nwhenas it seemed to him time, Messer Ricciardo discovered to him, as\r\nbest and most civilly he knew, the occasion of his coming and prayed\r\nhim take what he pleased and restore him the lady. To which Paganino\r\nmade answer with a cheerful countenance, 'Sir, you are welcome, and to\r\nanswer you briefly, I say thus; it is true I have a young lady in my\r\nhouse, if she be your wife or another's I know not, for that I know\r\nyou not nor indeed her, save in so much as she hath abidden awhile\r\nwith me. If you be, as you say, her husband, I will, since you seem to\r\nme a civil gentleman, carry you to her and I am assured that she will\r\nknow you right well. If she say it is as you avouch and be willing to\r\ngo with you, you shall, for the sake of your civility, give me what\r\nyou yourself will to her ransom; but, an it be not so, you would do\r\nill to seek to take her from me, for that I am a young man and can\r\nentertain a woman as well as another, and especially such an one as\r\nshe, who is the most pleasing I ever saw.' Quoth Messer Ricciardo,\r\n'For certain she is my wife, an thou bring me where she is, thou shalt\r\nsoon see it; for she will incontinent throw herself on my neck;\r\nwherefore I ask no better than that it be as thou proposest.' 'Then,'\r\nsaid Paganino, 'let us be going.' Accordingly they betook themselves\r\nto the corsair's house, where he brought the judge into a saloon of\r\nhis and let call the lady, who issued forth of a chamber, all dressed\r\nand tired, and came whereas they were, but accosted Messer Ricciardo\r\nno otherwise than as she would any other stranger who might have come\r\nhome with Paganino. The judge, who looked to have been received by her\r\nwith the utmost joy, marvelled sore at this and fell a-saying in\r\nhimself, 'Belike the chagrin and long grief I have suffered, since I\r\nlost her, have so changed me that she knoweth me not.' Wherefore he\r\nsaid to her, 'Wife, it hath cost me dear to carry thee a-fishing, for\r\nthat never was grief felt like that which I have suffered since I lost\r\nthee, and now meseemeth thou knowest me not, so distantly dost thou\r\ngreet me. Seest thou not that I am thine own Messer Ricciardo, come\r\nhither to pay that which this gentleman, in whose house we are, shall\r\nrequire to thy ransom and to carry thee away? And he, of his favour,\r\nrestoreth thee to me for what I will.' The lady turned to him and\r\nsaid, smiling somewhat, 'Speak you to me, sir? Look you mistake me\r\nnot, for, for my part, I mind me not ever to have seen you.' Quoth\r\nRicciardo, 'Look what thou sayest; consider me well; an thou wilt but\r\nrecollect thyself, thou wilt see that I am thine own Ricciardo di\r\nChinzica.' 'Sir,' answered the lady, 'you will pardon me; belike it is\r\nnot so seemly a thing as you imagine for me to look much on you.\r\nNevertheless I have seen enough of you to know that I never before set\r\neyes on you.' Ricciardo, concluding that she did this for fear of\r\nPaganino and chose not to confess to knowing him in the latter's\r\npresence, besought him of his favour that he might speak with her in a\r\nroom alone. Paganino replied that he would well, so but he would not\r\nkiss her against her will, and bade the lady go with him into a\r\nchamber and there hear what he had to say and answer him as it should\r\nplease her. Accordingly the lady and Messer Ricciardo went into a room\r\napart and as soon as they were seated, the latter began to say,\r\n'Alack, heart of my body, sweet my soul and my hope, knowest thou not\r\nthy Ricciardo, who loveth thee more than himself? How can this be? Am\r\nI so changed? Prithee, fair mine eye, do but look on me a little.' The\r\nlady began to laugh and without letting him say more, replied, 'You\r\nmay be assured that I am not so scatterbrained but that I know well\r\nenough you are Messer Ricciardo di Chinzica, my husband; but, what\r\ntime I was with you, you showed that you knew me very ill, for that\r\nyou should have had the sense to see that I was young and lusty and\r\ngamesome and should consequently have known that which behoveth unto\r\nyoung ladies, over and above clothes and meat, albeit for\r\nshamefastness they name it not; the which how you performed, you know.\r\nIf the study of the laws was more agreeable to you than your wife, you\r\nshould not have taken her, albeit it never appeared to me that you\r\nwere a judge; nay, you seemed to me rather a common crier of saints'\r\ndays and sacraments and fasts and vigils, so well you knew them. And I\r\ntell you this, that, had you suffered the husbandmen who till your\r\nlands keep as many holidays as you allowed him who had the tilling of\r\nmy poor little field, you would never have reaped the least grain of\r\ncorn. However, as God, having compassion on my youth, hath willed it,\r\nI have happened on yonder man, with whom I abide in this chamber,\r\nwherein it is unknown what manner of thing is a holiday (I speak of\r\nthose holidays which you, more assiduous in the service of God than in\r\nthat of the ladies, did so diligently celebrate) nor ever yet entered\r\nin at this door Saturday nor Friday nor vigil nor Emberday nor Lent,\r\nthat is so long; nay, here swink we day and night and thump our wool;\r\nand this very night after matinsong, I know right well how the thing\r\nwent, once he was up. Wherefore I mean to abide with him and work;\r\nwhilst I am young, and leave saints' days and jubilees and fasts for\r\nmy keeping when I am old; so get you gone about your business as\r\nquickliest you may, good luck go with you, and keep as many holidays\r\nas you please, without me.' Messer Ricciardo, hearing these words, was\r\ndistressed beyond endurance and said, whenas he saw she had made an\r\nend of speaking. 'Alack, sweet my soul, what is this thou sayest? Hast\r\nthou no regard for thy kinsfolk's honour and thine own? Wilt thou\r\nrather abide here for this man's whore and in mortal sin than at Pisa\r\nas my wife? He, when he is weary of thee, will turn thee away to thine\r\nown exceeding reproach, whilst I will still hold thee dear and still\r\n(e'en though I willed it not) thou shalt be mistress of my house. Wilt\r\nthou for the sake of a lewd and disorderly appetite, forsake thine\r\nhonour and me, who love thee more than my life? For God's sake, dear\r\nmy hope, speak no more thus, but consent to come with me; henceforth,\r\nsince I know thy desire, I will enforce myself [to content it;]\r\nwherefore, sweet my treasure, change counsel and come away with me,\r\nwho have never known weal since thou wast taken from me.' Whereto\r\nanswered the lady, 'I have no mind that any, now that it availeth not,\r\nshould be more tender of my honour than I myself; would my kinsfolk\r\nhad had regard thereto, whenas they gave me to you! But, as they had\r\nthen no care for my honour, I am under no present concern to be\r\ncareful of theirs; and if I am herein _mortar_[142] sin, I shall abide\r\nthough it be in pestle[142] sin. And let me tell you that here\r\nmeseemeth I am Paganino's wife, whereas at Pisa meseemed I was your\r\nwhore, seeing that there, by season of the moon and quadratures of\r\ngeometry, needs must be planets concur to couple betwixt you and me,\r\nwhereas here Paganino holdeth me all night in his arms and straineth\r\nme and biteth me, and how he serveth me, let God tell you for me. You\r\nsay forsooth you will enforce yourself; to what? To do it in three\r\ncasts and cause it stand by dint of cudgelling? I warrant me you are\r\ngrown a doughty cavalier since I saw you last! Begone and enforce\r\nyourself to live, for methinketh indeed you do but sojourn here below\r\nupon sufferance, so peaked and scant o' wind you show to me. And yet\r\nmore I tell you, that, should he leave me (albeit meseemeth he is\r\nnowise inclined thereto, so I choose to stay,) I purpose not therefor\r\never to return to you, of whom squeeze you as I might, there were no\r\nmaking a porringer of sauce; for that I abode with you once to my\r\ngrievous hurt and loss, wherefore in such a case I should seek my\r\nvantage elsewhere. Nay, once again I tell you, here be neither saints'\r\ndays nor vigils; wherefore here I mean to abide; so get you gone in\r\nGod's name as quickliest you may, or I will cry out that you would\r\nfain force me.' Messer Ricciardo, seeing himself in ill case and now\r\nrecognizing his folly in taking a young wife, whenas he was himself\r\nforspent, went forth the chamber tristful and woebegone, and bespoke\r\nPaganino with many words, that skilled not a jot. Ultimately, leaving\r\nthe lady, he returned to Pisa, without having accomplished aught, and\r\nthere for chagrin fell into such dotage that, as he went about Pisa,\r\nto whoso greeted him or asked him of anywhat, he answered nought but\r\n'The ill hole[143] will have no holidays;'[144] and there, no great\r\nwhile after, he died. Paganino, hearing this and knowing the love the\r\nlady bore himself, espoused her to his lawful wife and thereafter,\r\nwithout ever observing saints' day or vigil or keeping Lent, they\r\nwrought what while their legs would carry them and led a jolly life of\r\nit. Wherefore, dear my ladies, meseemeth Bernabo, in his dispute with\r\nAmbrogiuolo, rode the she-goat down the steep.\"[145]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 141: According to one of the commentators of the Decameron,\r\nthere are as many churches at Ravenna as days in the year and each day\r\nis there celebrated as that of some saint or other.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: A trifling jingle upon the similarity in sound of the\r\nwords _mortale_ (mortal), _mortaio_ (mortar), _pestello_ (pestle), and\r\n_pestilente_ (pestilential). The same word-play occurs at least once\r\nmore in the Decameron.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: _Il mal foro_, a woman's commodity (Florio).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: _i.e._ _Cunnus nonvult feriari._ Some commentators\r\npropose to read _il mal furo_, the ill thief, supposing Ricciardo to\r\nallude to Paganino, but this seems far-fetched.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: _i.e. semble_ ran headlong to destruction. The\r\ncommentators explain this proverbial expression by saying that a\r\nshe-goat is in any case a hazardous mount, and _a fortiori_ when\r\nridden down a precipice; but this seems a somewhat \"sporting\" kind of\r\ninterpretation.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis story gave such occasion for laughter to all the company that\r\nthere was none whose jaws ached not therefor, and all the ladies\r\navouched with one accord that Dioneo spoke sooth and that Bernabo had\r\nbeen an ass. But, after the story was ended and the laughter abated,\r\nthe queen, observing that the hour was now late and that all had told\r\nand seeing that the end of her seignory was come, according to the\r\nordinance commenced, took the wreath from her own head and set it on\r\nthat of Neifile, saying, with a blithe aspect, \"Henceforth, companion\r\ndear, be thine the governance of this little people\"; and reseated\r\nherself. Neifile blushed a little at the honour received and became in\r\ncountenance like as showeth a new-blown rose of April or of May in the\r\nbreaking of the day, with lovesome eyes some little downcast,\r\nsparkling no otherwise than the morning-star. But, after the courteous\r\nmurmur of the bystanders, whereby they gladsomely approved their\r\ngoodwill towards the new-made queen, had abated and she had taken\r\nheart again, she seated herself somewhat higher than of wont and said,\r\n\"Since I am to be your queen, I will, departing not from the manner\r\nholden of those who have foregone me and whose governance you have by\r\nyour obedience commended, make manifest to you in few words my\r\nopinion, which, an it be approved by your counsel, we will ensue.\r\nTo-morrow, as you know, is Friday and the next day is Saturday, days\r\nwhich, by reason of the viands that are used therein,[146] are\r\nsomewhat irksome to most folk, more by token that Friday, considering\r\nthat He who died for our life on that day suffered passion, is worthy\r\nof reverence; wherefore I hold it a just thing and a seemly that, in\r\nhonour of the Divinity, we apply ourselves rather to orisons than to\r\nstory-telling. As for Saturday, it is the usance of ladies on that day\r\nto wash their heads and do away all dust and all uncleanliness\r\nbefallen them for the labours of the past week; and many, likewise,\r\nuse, in reverence of the Virgin Mother of the Son of God, to fast and\r\nrest from all manner of work in honour of the ensuing Sunday.\r\nWherefore, we being unable fully to ensue the order of living taken by\r\nus, on like wise methinketh we were well to rest from story-telling on\r\nthat day also; after which, for that we shall then have sojourned here\r\nfour days, I hold it opportune, an we would give no occasion for\r\nnewcomers to intrude upon us, that we remove hence and get us gone\r\nelsewhither; where I have already considered and provided. There when\r\nwe shall be assembled together on Sunday, after sleeping,--we having\r\nto-day had leisure enough for discoursing at large,[147]--I have\r\nbethought myself,--at once that you may have more time to consider and\r\nbecause it will be yet goodlier that the license of our story-telling\r\nbe somewhat straitened and that we devise of one of the many fashions\r\nof fortune,--that our discourse shall be OF SUCH AS HAVE, BY DINT OF\r\nDILIGENCE,[148] ACQUIRED SOME MUCH DESIRED THING OR RECOVERED SOME\r\nLOST GOOD. Whereupon let each think to tell somewhat that may be\r\nuseful or at least entertaining to the company, saving always Dioneo\r\nhis privilege.\" All commended the speech and disposition of the queen\r\nand ordained that it should be as she had said. Then, calling for her\r\nseneschal, she particularly instructed him where he should set the\r\ntables that evening and after of what he should do during all the time\r\nof her seignory; and this done, rising to her feet, she gave the\r\ncompany leave to do that which was most pleasing unto each.\r\nAccordingly, ladies and men betook themselves to a little garden and\r\nthere, after they had disported themselves awhile, the hour of supper\r\nbeing come, they supped with mirth and pleasance; then, all arising\r\nthence and Emilia, by the queen's commandment, leading the round, the\r\nditty following was sung by Pampinea, whilst the other ladies\r\nresponded:\r\n\r\n     What lady aye should sing, and if not I,\r\n     Who'm blest with all for which a maid can sigh?\r\n     Come then, O Love, thou source of all my weal,\r\n       All hope and every issue glad and bright\r\n         Sing ye awhile yfere\r\n     Of sighs nor bitter pains I erst did feel,\r\n       That now but sweeten to me thy delight,\r\n       Nay, but of that fire clear,\r\n       Wherein I, burning, live in joy and cheer,\r\n     And as my God, thy name do magnify.\r\n\r\n     Thou settest, Love, before these eyes of mine\r\n       Whenas thy fire I entered the first day,\r\n         A youngling so beseen\r\n     With valour, worth and loveliness divine,\r\n       That never might one find a goodlier, nay,\r\n         Nor yet his match, I ween.\r\n         So sore I burnt for him I still must e'en\r\n     Sing, blithe, of him with thee, my lord most high.\r\n\r\n     And that in him which crowneth my liesse\r\n       Is that I please him, as he pleaseth me,\r\n         Thanks to Love debonair;\r\n     Thus in this world my wish I do possess\r\n       And in the next I trust at peace to be,\r\n         Through that fast faith I bear\r\n         To him; sure God, who seeth this, will ne'er\r\n     The kingdom of His bliss to us deny.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: _i.e._ Friday being a fast day and Saturday a _jour\r\nmaigre_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: _i.e._ generally upon the vicissitudes of Fortune and\r\nnot upon any particular feature.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: _Industria_, syn. address, skilful contrivance.]\r\n\r\nAfter this they sang sundry other songs and danced sundry dances and\r\nplayed upon divers instruments of music. Then, the queen deeming it\r\ntime to go to rest, each betook himself, with torches before him, to\r\nhis chamber, and all on the two following days, whilst applying\r\nthemselves to those things whereof the queen had spoken, looked\r\nlongingly for Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE ENDETH THE SECOND DAY\r\nOF THE DECAMERON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Day the Third_\r\n\r\n     HERE BEGINNETH THE THIRD DAY OF THE DECAMERON WHEREIN UNDER\r\n     THE GOVERNANCE OF NEIFILE IS DISCOURSED OF SUCH AS HAVE BY\r\n     DINT OF DILIGENCE ACQUIRED SOME MUCH DESIRED THING OR\r\n     RECOVERED SOME LOST GOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dawn from vermeil began to grow orange-tawny, at the approach of\r\nthe sun, when on the Sunday the queen arose and caused all her company\r\nrise also. The seneschal had a great while before despatched to the\r\nplace whither they were to go store of things needful and folk who\r\nshould there make ready that which behoved, and seeing the queen now\r\non the way, straightway let load everything else, as if the camp were\r\nraised thence, and with the household stuff and such of the servants\r\nas remained set out in rear of the ladies and gentlemen. The queen,\r\nthen, with slow step, accompanied and followed by her ladies and the\r\nthree young men and guided by the song of some score nightingales and\r\nother birds, took her way westward, by a little-used footpath, full of\r\ngreen herbs and flowers, which latter now all began to open for the\r\ncoming sun, and chatting, jesting and laughing with her company,\r\nbrought them a while before half tierce,[149] without having gone over\r\ntwo thousand paces, to a very fair and rich palace, somewhat upraised\r\nabove the plain upon a little knoll. Here they entered and having gone\r\nall about and viewed the great saloons and the quaint and elegant\r\nchambers all throughly furnished with that which pertaineth thereunto,\r\nthey mightily commended the place and accounted its lord magnificent.\r\nThen, going below and seeing the very spacious and cheerful court\r\nthereof, the cellars full of choicest wines and the very cool water\r\nthat welled there in great abundance, they praised it yet more.\r\nThence, as if desirous of repose, they betook themselves to sit in a\r\ngallery which commanded all the courtyard and was all full of flowers,\r\nsuch as the season afforded, and leafage, whereupon there came the\r\ncareful seneschal and entertained and refreshed them with costliest\r\nconfections and wines of choice. Thereafter, letting open to them a\r\ngarden, all walled about, which coasted the palace, they entered\r\ntherein and it seeming to them, at their entering, altogether[150]\r\nwonder-goodly, they addressed themselves more intently to view the\r\nparticulars thereof. It had about it and athwart the middle very\r\nspacious alleys, all straight as arrows and embowered with trellises\r\nof vines, which made great show of bearing abundance of grapes that\r\nyear and being then all in blossom, yielded so rare a savour about the\r\ngarden, that, as it blent with the fragrance of many another\r\nsweet-smelling plant that there gave scent, themseemed they were among\r\nall the spiceries that ever grew in the Orient. The sides of these\r\nalleys were all in a manner walled about with roses, red and white,\r\nand jessamine, wherefore not only of a morning, but what while the sun\r\nwas highest, one might go all about, untouched thereby, neath\r\nodoriferous and delightsome shade. What and how many and how orderly\r\ndisposed were the plants that grew in that place, it were tedious to\r\nrecount; suffice it that there is none goodly of those which may brook\r\nour air but was there in abundance. Amiddleward the garden (what was\r\nnot less, but yet more commendable than aught else there) was a plat\r\nof very fine grass, so green that it seemed well nigh black, enamelled\r\nall with belike a thousand kinds of flowers and closed about with the\r\ngreenest and lustiest of orange and citron trees, the which, bearing\r\nat once old fruits and new and flowers, not only afforded the eyes a\r\npleasant shade, but were no less grateful to the smell. Midmost the\r\ngrass-plat was a fountain of the whitest marble, enchased with\r\nwonder-goodly sculptures, and thence,--whether I know not from a\r\nnatural or an artificial source,--there sprang, by a figure that stood\r\non a column in its midst, so great a jet of water and so high towards\r\nthe sky, whence not without a delectable sound it fell back into the\r\nwonder-limpid fount, that a mill might have wrought with less; the\r\nwhich after (I mean the water which overflowed the full basin) issued\r\nforth of the lawn by a hidden way, and coming to light therewithout,\r\nencompassed it all about by very goodly and curiously wroughten\r\nchannels. Thence by like channels it ran through well nigh every part\r\nof the pleasance and was gathered again at the last in a place whereby\r\nit had issue from the fair garden and whence it descended, in the\r\nclearest of streams, towards the plain; but, ere it won thither, it\r\nturned two mills with exceeding power and to the no small vantage of\r\nthe lord. The sight of this garden and its fair ordinance and the\r\nplants and the fountain, with the rivulets proceeding therefrom, so\r\npleased the ladies and the three young men that they all of one accord\r\navouched that, an Paradise might be created upon earth, they could not\r\navail to conceive what form, other than that of this garden, might be\r\ngiven it nor what farther beauty might possibly be added thereunto.\r\nHowever, as they went most gladsomely thereabout, weaving them the\r\ngoodliest garlands of the various leafage of the trees and hearkening\r\nthe while to the carols of belike a score of different kinds of birds,\r\nthat sang as if in rivalry one of other, they became aware of a\r\ndelectable beauty, which, wonderstricken as they were with the other\r\ncharms of the place, they had not yet noted; to wit, they found the\r\ngarden full of maybe an hundred kinds of goodly creatures, and one\r\nshowing them to other, they saw on one side rabbits issue, on another\r\nhares run; here lay kids and there fawns went grazing, and there was\r\nmany another kind of harmless animal, each going about his pastime at\r\nhis pleasure, as if tame; the which added unto them a yet greater\r\npleasure than the others. After they had gone about their fill,\r\nviewing now this thing and now that, the queen let set the tables\r\naround the fair fountain and at her commandment, having first sung\r\nhalf a dozen canzonets and danced sundry dances, they sat down to\r\nmeat. There, being right well and orderly served, after a very fair\r\nand sumptuous and tranquil fashion, with goodly and delicate viands,\r\nthey waxed yet blither and arising thence, gave themselves anew to\r\nmusic-making and singing and dancing till it seemed good to the queen\r\nthat those whom it pleased should betake themselves to sleep.\r\nAccordingly some went thither, whilst others, overcome with the beauty\r\nof the place, willed not to leave it, but, abiding there, addressed\r\nthemselves, some to reading romances and some to playing chess or\r\ntables, whilst the others slept. But presently, the hour of none being\r\npast and the sleepers having arisen and refreshed their faces with\r\ncold water, they came all, at the queen's commandment, to the lawn\r\nhard by the fountain and there seating themselves, after the wonted\r\nfashion, waited to fall to story-telling upon the subject proposed by\r\nher. The first upon whom she laid this charge was Filostrato, who\r\nbegan on this wise:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: _i.e._ half _before_ (not half _after_) tierce or 7.30\r\na.m. _Cf._ the equivalent German idiom, _halb acht_, 7.30 (not 8.30)\r\na.m.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: _i.e._ as a whole (_tutto insieme_).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Third]\r\n\r\n     MASETTO OF LAMPORECCHIO FEIGNETH HIMSELF DUMB AND BECOMETH\r\n     GARDENER TO A CONVENT OF WOMEN, WHO ALL FLOCK TO LIE WITH\r\n     HIM\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Fairest ladies, there be many men and women foolish enough to believe\r\nthat, whenas the white fillet is bound about a girl's head and the\r\nblack cowl clapped upon her back, she is no longer a woman and is no\r\nlonger sensible of feminine appetites, as if the making her a nun had\r\nchanged her to stone; and if perchance they hear aught contrary to\r\nthis their belief, they are as much incensed as if a very great and\r\nheinous misdeed had been committed against nature, considering not\r\nneither having regard to themselves, whom full license to do that\r\nwhich they will availeth not to sate, nor yet to the much potency of\r\nidlesse and thought-taking.[151] On like wise there are but too many\r\nwho believe that spade and mattock and coarse victuals and hard living\r\ndo altogether purge away carnal appetites from the tillers of the\r\nearth and render them exceeding dull of wit and judgment. But how much\r\nall who believe thus are deluded, I purpose, since the queen hath\r\ncommanded it to me, to make plain to you in a little story, without\r\ndeparting from the theme by her appointed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: _Sollecitudine._ The commentators will have it that\r\nthis is an error for _solitudine_, solitude, but I see no necessity\r\nfor the substitution, the text being perfectly acceptable as it\r\nstands.]\r\n\r\nThere was (and is yet) in these our parts a convent of women, very\r\nfamous for sanctity (the which, that I may not anywise abate its\r\nrepute, I will not name), wherein no great while agone, there being\r\nthen no more than eight nuns and an abbess, all young, in the nunnery,\r\na poor silly dolt of a fellow was gardener of a very goodly garden of\r\ntheirs, who, being miscontent with his wage, settled his accounts with\r\nthe ladies' bailiff and returned to Lamporecchio, whence he came.\r\nThere, amongst others who welcomed him home, was a young labouring\r\nman, stout and robust and (for a countryman) a well-favoured fellow,\r\nby name of Masetto, who asked him where he had been so long. The good\r\nman, whose name was Nuto, told him, whereupon Masetto asked him in\r\nwhat he had served the convent, and he, 'I tended a great and goodly\r\ngarden of theirs, and moreover I went while to the coppice for faggots\r\nand drew water and did other such small matters of service; but the\r\nnuns gave me so little wage that I could scare find me in shoon\r\nwithal. Besides, they are all young and methinketh they are possessed\r\nof the devil, for there was no doing anything to their liking; nay,\r\nwhen I was at work whiles in the hortyard,[152] quoth one, \"Set this\r\nhere,\" and another, \"Set that here,\" and a third snatched the spade\r\nfrom my hand, saying, \"That is naught\"; brief, they gave me so much\r\nvexation that I would leave work be and begone out of the hortyard;\r\ninsomuch that, what with one thing and what with another, I would\r\nabide there no longer and took myself off. When I came away, their\r\nbailiff besought me, an I could lay my hand on any one apt unto that\r\nservice, to send the man to him, and I promised it him; but may God\r\nmake him sound of the loins as he whom I shall get him, else will I\r\nsend him none at all!' Masetto, hearing this, was taken with so great\r\na desire to be with these nuns that he was all consumed therewith,\r\njudging from Nuto's words that he might avail to compass somewhat of\r\nthat which he desired. However, foreseeing that he would fail of his\r\npurpose, if he discovered aught thereof to Nuto, he said to the\r\nlatter, 'Egad, thou didst well to come away. How is a man to live with\r\nwomen? He were better abide with devils. Six times out of seven they\r\nknow not what they would have themselves.' But, after they had made an\r\nend of their talk, Masetto began to cast about what means he should\r\ntake to be with them and feeling himself well able to do the offices\r\nof which Nuto had spoken, he had no fear of being refused on that\r\nhead, but misdoubted him he might not be received, for that he was\r\nyoung and well-looked. Wherefore, after pondering many things in\r\nhimself, he bethought himself thus: 'The place is far hence and none\r\nknoweth me there, an I can but make a show of being dumb, I shall for\r\ncertain be received there.' Having fixed upon this device, he set out\r\nwith an axe he had about his neck, without telling any whither he was\r\nbound, and betook himself, in the guise of a beggarman, to the\r\nconvent, where being come, he entered in and as luck would have it,\r\nfound the bailiff in the courtyard. Him he accosted with signs such as\r\ndumb folk use and made a show of asking food of him for the love of\r\nGod and that in return he would, an it were needed, cleave wood for\r\nhim. The bailiff willingly gave him to eat and after set before him\r\ndivers logs that Nuto had not availed to cleave, but of all which\r\nMasetto, who was very strong, made a speedy despatch. By and by, the\r\nbailiff, having occasion to go to the coppice, carried him thither and\r\nput him to cutting faggots; after which, setting the ass before him,\r\nhe gave him to understand by signs that he was to bring them home.\r\nThis he did very well; wherefore the bailiff kept him there some days,\r\nso he might have him do certain things for which he had occasion. One\r\nday it chanced that the abbess saw him and asked the bailiff who he\r\nwas. 'Madam,' answered he, 'this is a poor deaf and dumb man, who came\r\nhither the other day to ask an alms; so I took him in out of charity\r\nand have made him do sundry things of which we had need. If he knew\r\nhow to till the hortyard and chose to abide with us, I believe we\r\nshould get good service of him; for that we lack such an one and he is\r\nstrong and we could make what we would of him; more by token that you\r\nwould have no occasion to fear his playing the fool with yonder lasses\r\nof yours.' 'I' faith,' rejoined the abbess, 'thou sayst sooth. Learn\r\nif he knoweth how to till and study to keep him here; give him a pair\r\nof shoes and some old hood or other and make much of him, caress him,\r\ngive him plenty to eat.' Which the bailiff promised to do. Masetto was\r\nnot so far distant but he heard all this, making a show the while of\r\nsweeping the courtyard, and said merrily in himself, 'An you put me\r\ntherein, I will till you your hortyard as it was never tilled yet.'\r\nAccordingly, the bailiff, seeing that he knew right well how to work,\r\nasked him by signs if he had a mind to abide there and he replied on\r\nlike wise that he would do whatsoever he wished; whereupon the bailiff\r\nengaged him and charged him till the hortyard, showing him what he was\r\nto do; after which he went about other business of the convent and\r\nleft him. Presently, as Masetto went working one day after another,\r\nthe nuns fell to plaguing him and making mock of him, as ofttimes it\r\nbetideth that folk do with mutes, and bespoke him the naughtiest words\r\nin the world, thinking he understood them not; whereof the abbess,\r\nmayhap supposing him to be tailless as well as tongueless, recked\r\nlittle or nothing. It chanced one day, however, that, as he rested\r\nhimself after a hard morning's work, two young nuns, who went about\r\nthe garden,[153] drew near the place where he lay and fell to looking\r\nupon him, whilst he made a show of sleeping. Presently quoth one who\r\nwas somewhat the bolder of the twain to the other, 'If I thought thou\r\nwouldst keep my counsel, I would tell thee a thought which I have once\r\nand again had and which might perchance profit thee also.' 'Speak in\r\nall assurance,' answered the other, 'for certes I will never tell it\r\nto any.' Then said the forward wench, 'I know not if thou have ever\r\nconsidered how straitly we are kept and how no man dare ever enter\r\nhere, save the bailiff, who is old, and yonder dumb fellow; and I have\r\nagain and again heard ladies, who come to visit us, say that all other\r\ndelights in the world are but toys in comparison with that which a\r\nwoman enjoyeth, whenas she hath to do with a man. Wherefore I have\r\noften had it in mind to make trial with this mute, since with others I\r\nmay not, if it be so. And indeed he is the best in the world to that\r\nend, for that, e'en if he would, he could not nor might tell it\r\nagain. Thou seest he is a poor silly lout of a lad, who hath overgrown\r\nhis wit, and I would fain hear how thou deemest of the thing.'\r\n'Alack!' rejoined the other, 'what is this thou sayest? Knowest thou\r\nnot that we have promised our virginity to God?' 'Oh, as for that,'\r\nanswered the first, 'how many things are promised Him all day long,\r\nwhereof not one is fulfilled unto Him! An we have promised it Him, let\r\nHim find Himself another or others to perform it to Him.' 'Or if,'\r\nwent on her fellow, 'we should prove with child, how would it go\r\nthen?' Quoth the other, 'Thou beginnest to take thought unto ill ere\r\nit cometh; when that betideth, then will we look to it; there will be\r\na thousand ways for us of doing so that it shall never be known,\r\nprovided we ourselves tell it not.' The other, hearing this and having\r\nnow a greater itch than her companion to prove what manner beast a man\r\nwas, said, 'Well, then, how shall we do?' Quoth the first, 'Thou seest\r\nit is nigh upon none and methinketh the sisters are all asleep, save\r\nonly ourselves; let us look about the hortyard if there be any there,\r\nand if there be none, what have we to do but to take him by the hand\r\nand carry him into yonder hut, whereas he harboureth against the rain,\r\nand there let one of us abide with him, whilst the other keepeth\r\nwatch? He is so simple that he will do whatever we will.' Masetto\r\nheard all this talk and disposed to compliance, waited but to be taken\r\nby one of the nuns. The latter having looked well all about and\r\nsatisfied themselves that they could be seen from nowhere, she who had\r\nbroached the matter came up to Masetto and aroused him, whereupon he\r\nrose incontinent to his feet. The nun took him coaxingly by the hand\r\nand led him, grinning like an idiot, to the hut, where, without\r\novermuch pressing, he did what she would. Then, like a loyal comrade,\r\nhaving had her will, she gave place to her fellow, and Masetto, still\r\nfeigning himself a simpleton, did their pleasure. Before they departed\r\nthence, each of the girls must needs once more prove how the mute\r\ncould horse it, and after devising with each other, they agreed that\r\nthe thing was as delectable as they had heard, nay, more so.\r\nAccordingly, watching their opportunity, they went oftentimes at\r\nfitting seasons to divert themselves with the mute, till one day it\r\nchanced that one of their sisters, espying them in the act from the\r\nlattice of her cell, showed it to other twain. At first they talked of\r\ndenouncing the culprits to the abbess, but, after, changing counsel\r\nand coming to an accord with the first two, they became sharers with\r\nthem in Masetto's services, and to them the other three nuns were at\r\ndivers times and by divers chances added as associates. Ultimately,\r\nthe abbess, who had not yet gotten wind of these doings, walking one\r\nday alone in the garden, the heat being great, found Masetto (who had\r\nenough of a little fatigue by day, because of overmuch posting it by\r\nnight) stretched out asleep under the shade of an almond-tree, and the\r\nwind lifting the forepart of his clothes, all abode discovered. The\r\nlady, beholding this and seeing herself alone, fell into that same\r\nappetite which had gotten hold of her nuns, and arousing Masetto,\r\ncarried him to her chamber, where, to the no small miscontent of the\r\nothers, who complained loudly that the gardener came not to till the\r\nhortyard, she kept him several days, proving and reproving that\r\ndelight which she had erst been wont to blame in others. At last she\r\nsent him back to his own lodging, but was fain to have him often again\r\nand as, moreover, she required of him more than her share, Masetto,\r\nunable to satisfy so many, bethought himself that his playing the mute\r\nmight, an it endured longer, result in his exceeding great hurt.\r\nWherefore, being one night with the abbess, he gave loose to[154] his\r\ntongue and bespoke her thus: 'Madam, I have heard say that one cock\r\nsufficeth unto half a score hens, but that half a score men can ill or\r\nhardly satisfy one woman; whereas needs must I serve nine, and to this\r\nI can no wise endure; nay, for that which I have done up to now, I am\r\ncome to such a pass that I can do neither little nor much; wherefore\r\ndo ye either let me go in God's name or find a remedy for the matter.'\r\nThe abbess, hearing him speak whom she held dumb, was all amazed and\r\nsaid, 'What is this? Methought thou wast dumb.' 'Madam,' answered\r\nMasetto, 'I was indeed dumb, not by nature, but by reason of a malady\r\nwhich bereft me of speech, and only this very night for the first time\r\ndo I feel it restored to me, wherefore I praise God as most I may.'\r\nThe lady believed this and asked him what he meant by saying that he\r\nhad to serve nine. Masetto told her how the case stood, whereby she\r\nperceived that she had no nun but was far wiser than herself; but,\r\nlike a discreet woman as she was, she resolved to take counsel with\r\nher nuns to find some means of arranging the matter, without letting\r\nMasetto go, so the convent might not be defamed by him. Accordingly,\r\nhaving openly confessed to one another that which had been secretly\r\ndone of each, they all of one accord, with Masetto's consent, so\r\nordered it that the people round about believed speech to have been\r\nrestored to him, after he had long been mute, through their prayers\r\nand by the merits of the saint in whose name the convent was\r\nintituled, and their bailiff being lately dead, they made Masetto\r\nbailiff in his stead and apportioned his toils on such wise that he\r\ncould endure them. Thereafter, albeit he began upon them monikins\r\ngalore, the thing was so discreetly ordered that nothing took vent\r\nthereof till after the death of the abbess, when Masetto began to grow\r\nold and had a mind to return home rich. The thing becoming known,\r\nenabled him lightly to accomplish his desire, and thus Masetto, having\r\nby his foresight contrived to employ his youth to good purpose,\r\nreturned in his old age, rich and a father, without being at the pains\r\nor expense of rearing children, to the place whence he had set out\r\nwith an axe about his neck, avouching that thus did Christ entreat\r\nwhoso set horns to his cap.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: Hortyard (_orto_) is the old form of orchard, properly\r\nan enclosed tract of land in which fruit, vegetables and potherbs are\r\ncultivated for use, _i.e._ the modern kitchen garden and orchard in\r\none, as distinguished from the pleasaunce or flower garden\r\n(_giardino_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: _Giardino_, _i.e._ flower-garden.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: Lit. broke the string of.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Third]\r\n\r\n     A HORSEKEEPER LIETH WITH THE WIFE OF KING AGILULF, WHO,\r\n     BECOMING AWARE THEREOF, WITHOUT WORD SAID, FINDETH HIM OUT\r\n     AND POLLETH HIM; BUT THE POLLED MAN POLLETH ALL HIS FELLOWS\r\n     ON LIKE WISE AND SO ESCAPETH ILL HAP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe end of Filostrato's story, whereat whiles the ladies had some\r\nlittle blushed and other whiles laughed, being come, it pleased the\r\nqueen that Pampinea should follow on with a story, and she\r\naccordingly, beginning with a smiling countenance, said, \"Some are so\r\nlittle discreet in seeking at all hazards to show that they know and\r\napprehend that which it concerneth them not to know, that whiles,\r\nrebuking to this end unperceived defects in others, they think to\r\nlessen their own shame, whereas they do infinitely augment it; and\r\nthat this is so I purpose, lovesome ladies, to prove to you by the\r\ncontrary thereof, showing you the astuteness of one who, in the\r\njudgment of a king of worth and valour, was held belike of less\r\naccount than Masetto himself.\r\n\r\nAgilulf, King of the Lombards, as his predecessors had done, fixed the\r\nseat of his kingship at Pavia, a city of Lombardy, and took to wife\r\nTheodolinda[155] the widow of Autari, likewise King of the Lombards, a\r\nvery fair lady and exceeding discreet and virtuous, but ill fortuned\r\nin a lover.[156] The affairs of the Lombards having, thanks to the\r\nvalour and judgment of King Agilulf, been for some time prosperous and\r\nin quiet, it befell that one of the said queen's horse-keepers, a man\r\nof very low condition, in respect of birth, but otherwise of worth far\r\nabove so mean a station, and comely of person and tall as he were the\r\nking, became beyond measure enamoured of his mistress. His mean estate\r\nhindered him not from being sensible that this love of his was out of\r\nall reason, wherefore, like a discreet man as he was, he discovered it\r\nunto none, nor dared he make it known to her even with his eyes. But,\r\nalbeit he lived without any hope of ever winning her favour, yet\r\ninwardly he gloried in that he had bestowed his thoughts in such high\r\nplace, and being all aflame with amorous fire, he studied, beyond\r\nevery other of his fellows, to do whatsoever he deemed might pleasure\r\nthe queen; whereby it befell that, whenas she had occasion to ride\r\nabroad, she liefer mounted the palfrey of which he had charge than any\r\nother; and when this happened, he reckoned it a passing great favour\r\nto himself nor ever stirred from her stirrup, accounting himself happy\r\nwhat time he might but touch her clothes. But, as often enough we see\r\nit happen that, even as hope groweth less, so love waxeth greater, so\r\ndid it betide this poor groom, insomuch that sore uneath it was to him\r\nto avail to brook his great desire, keeping it, as he did, hidden and\r\nbeing upheld by no hope; and many a time, unable to rid himself of\r\nthat his love, he determined in himself to die. And considering\r\ninwardly of the manner, he resolved to seek his death on such wise\r\nthat it should be manifest he died for the love he bore the queen, to\r\nwhich end he bethought himself to try his fortune in an enterprise of\r\nsuch a sort as should afford him a chance of having or all or part of\r\nhis desire. He set not himself to seek to say aught to the queen nor\r\nto make her sensible of his love by letters, knowing he should speak\r\nand write in vain, but chose rather to essay an he might by practice\r\navail to lie with her; nor was there any other shift for it but to\r\nfind a means how he might, in the person of the king, who, he knew,\r\nlay not with her continually, contrive to make his way to her and\r\nenter her bedchamber. Accordingly, that he might see on what wise and\r\nin what habit the king went, whenas he visited her, he hid himself\r\nseveral times by night in a great saloon of the palace, which lay\r\nbetween the king's bedchamber and that of the queen, and one night,\r\namongst others, he saw the king come forth of his chamber, wrapped in\r\na great mantle, with a lighted taper in one hand and a little wand in\r\nthe other, and making for the queen's chamber, strike once or twice\r\nupon the door with the wand, without saying aught, whereupon it was\r\nincontinent opened to him and the taper taken from his hand. Noting\r\nthis and having seen the king return after the same fashion, he\r\nbethought himself to do likewise. Accordingly, finding means to have a\r\ncloak like that which he had seen the king wear, together with a taper\r\nand a wand, and having first well washed himself in a bagnio, lest\r\nhaply the smell of the muck should offend the queen or cause her smoke\r\nthe cheat, he hid himself in the great saloon, as of wont. Whenas he\r\nknew that all were asleep and it seemed to him time either to give\r\neffect to his desire or to make his way by high emprise[157] to the\r\nwished-for death, he struck a light with a flint and steel he had\r\nbrought with him and kindling the taper, wrapped himself fast in the\r\nmantle, then, going up to the chamber-door, smote twice upon it with\r\nthe wand. The door was opened by a bedchamber-woman, all sleepy-eyed,\r\nwho took the light and covered it; whereupon, without saying aught, he\r\npassed within the curtain, put off his mantle and entered the bed\r\nwhere the queen slept. Then, taking her desirefully in his arms and\r\nfeigning himself troubled (for that he knew the king's wont to be\r\nthat, whenas he was troubled, he cared not to hear aught), without\r\nspeaking or being spoken to, he several times carnally knew the queen;\r\nafter which, grievous as it seemed to him to depart, yet, fearing lest\r\nhis too long stay should be the occasion of turning the gotten delight\r\ninto dolour, he arose and taking up the mantle and the light,\r\nwithdrew, without word said, and returned, as quickliest he might, to\r\nhis own bed. He could scarce yet have been therein when the king arose\r\nand repaired to the queen's chamber, whereat she marvelled\r\nexceedingly; and as he entered the bed and greeted her blithely, she\r\ntook courage by his cheerfulness and said, 'O my lord, what new\r\nfashion is this of to-night? You left me but now, after having taken\r\npleasure of me beyond your wont, and do you return so soon? Have a\r\ncare what you do.' The king, hearing these words, at once concluded\r\nthat the queen had been deceived by likeness of manners and person,\r\nbut, like a wise man, bethought himself forthright, seeing that\r\nneither she nor any else had perceived the cheat, not to make her\r\naware thereof; which many simpletons would not have done, but would\r\nhave said, 'I have not been here, I. Who is it hath been here? How did\r\nit happen? Who came hither?' Whence many things might have arisen,\r\nwhereby he would needlessly have afflicted the lady and given her\r\nground for desiring another time that which she had already tasted;\r\nmore by token that, an he kept silence of the matter, no shame might\r\nrevert to him, whereas, by speaking, he would have brought dishonour\r\nupon himself. The king, then, more troubled at heart than in looks or\r\nspeech, answered, saying, 'Wife, seem I not to you man enough to have\r\nbeen here a first time and to come yet again after that?' 'Ay, my\r\nlord,' answered she. 'Nevertheless, I beseech you have regard to your\r\nhealth.' Quoth Agilulf, 'And it pleaseth me to follow your counsel,\r\nwherefore for the nonce I will get me gone again, without giving you\r\nmore annoy.' This said, taking up his mantle, he departed the chamber,\r\nwith a heart full of wrath and despite for the affront that he saw had\r\nbeen done him, and bethought himself quietly to seek to discover the\r\nculprit, concluding that he must be of the household and could not,\r\nwhoever he might be, have issued forth of the palace. Accordingly,\r\ntaking a very small light in a little lantern, he betook himself to a\r\nvery long gallery that was over the stables of his palace and where\r\nall his household slept in different beds, and judging that, whoever\r\nhe might be that had done what the queen said, his pulse and the\r\nbeating of his heart for the swink endured could not yet have had time\r\nto abate, he silently, beginning at one end of the gallery, fell to\r\nfeeling each one's breast, to know if his heart beat high. Although\r\nevery other slept fast, he who had been with the queen was not yet\r\nasleep, but, seeing the king come and guessing what he went seeking,\r\nfell into such a fright that to the beating of the heart caused by the\r\nlate-had fatigue, fear added yet a greater and he doubted not but the\r\nking, if he became aware of this, would put him to death without\r\ndelay, and many things passed through his thought that he should do.\r\nHowever, seeing him all unarmed, he resolved to feign sleep and await\r\nwhat he should do. Agilulf, then, having examined many and found none\r\nwhom he judged to be he of whom he was in quest, came presently to the\r\nhorsekeeper and feeling his heart beat high, said in himself, 'This is\r\nthe man.' Nevertheless, an he would have nought be known of that which\r\nhe purposed to do, he did nought to him but poll, with a pair of\r\nscissors he had brought with him, somewhat on one side of his hair,\r\nwhich they then wore very long, so by that token he might know him\r\nagain on the morrow; and this done, he withdrew and returned to his\r\nown chamber. The culprit, who had felt all this, like a shrewd fellow\r\nas he was, understood plainly enough why he had been thus marked;\r\nwherefore he arose without delay and finding a pair of shears, whereof\r\nit chanced there were several about the stables for the service of the\r\nhorses, went softly up to all who lay in the gallery and clipped each\r\none's hair on like wise over the ear; which having done without being\r\nobserved, he returned to sleep. When the king arose in the morning, he\r\ncommanded that all his household should present themselves before him,\r\nor ever the palace-doors were opened; and it was done as he said.\r\nThen, as they all stood before him with uncovered heads, he began to\r\nlook that he might know him whom he had polled; but, seeing the most\r\npart of them with their hair clipped after one and the same fashion,\r\nhe marvelled and said in himself, 'He whom I seek, for all he may be\r\nof mean estate, showeth right well he is of no mean wit.' Then, seeing\r\nthat he could not, without making a stir, avail to have him whom he\r\nsought, and having no mind to incur a great shame for the sake of a\r\npaltry revenge, it pleased him with one sole word to admonish the\r\nculprit and show him that he was ware of the matter; wherefore,\r\nturning to all who were present, he said, 'Let him who did it do it no\r\nmore and get you gone in peace.' Another would have been for giving\r\nthem the strappado, for torturing, examining and questioning, and\r\ndoing this, would have published that which every one should go about\r\nto conceal; and having thus discovered himself, though he should have\r\ntaken entire revenge for the affront suffered, his shame had not been\r\nminished, nay, were rather much enhanced therefor and his lady's\r\nhonour sullied. Those who heard the king's words marvelled and long\r\ndebated amongst themselves what he meant by this speech; but none\r\nunderstood it, save he whom it concerned, and he, like a wise man,\r\nnever, during Agilulf's lifetime, discovered the matter nor ever again\r\ncommitted his life to the hazard of such a venture.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 155: Boccaccio calls her _Teudelinga_; but I know of no\r\nauthority for this form of the name of the famous Longobardian queen.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 156: Referring apparently to the adventure related in the\r\npresent story.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: Lit. with high (_i.e._ worthy) cause (_con alta\r\ncagione_).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Third]\r\n\r\n     UNDER COLOUR OF CONFESSION AND OF EXCEEDING NICENESS OF\r\n     CONSCIENCE, A LADY, BEING ENAMOURED OF A YOUNG MAN, BRINGETH\r\n     A GRAVE FRIAR, WITHOUT HIS MISDOUBTING HIM THEREOF, TO\r\n     AFFORD A MEANS OF GIVING ENTIRE EFFECT TO HER PLEASURE\r\n\r\n\r\nPampinea being now silent and the daring and subtlety of the\r\nhorsekeeper having been extolled by several of the company, as also\r\nthe king's good sense, the queen, turning to Filomena, charged her\r\nfollow on; whereupon she blithely began to speak thus, \"I purpose to\r\nrecount to you a cheat which was in very deed put by a fair lady upon\r\na grave friar and which should be so much the more pleasing to every\r\nlayman as these [--friars, to wit--], albeit for the most part very\r\ndull fools and men of strange manners and usances, hold themselves to\r\nbe in everything both better worth and wiser than others, whereas they\r\nare of far less account than the rest of mankind, being men who,\r\nlacking, of the meanness of their spirit, the ability to provide\r\nthemselves, take refuge, like swine, whereas they may have what to\r\neat. And this story, charming ladies, I shall tell you, not only for\r\nthe ensuing of the order imposed, but to give you to know withal that\r\neven the clergy, to whom we women, beyond measure credulous as we are,\r\nyield overmuch faith, can be and are whiles adroitly befooled, and\r\nthat not by men only, but even by certain of our own sex.\r\n\r\nIn our city, the which is fuller of cozenage than of love or faith,\r\nthere was, not many years agone, a gentlewoman adorned with beauty and\r\ncharms and as richly endowed by nature as any of her sex with engaging\r\nmanners and loftiness of spirit and subtle wit, whose name albeit I\r\nknow, I purpose not to discover it, no, nor any other that pertaineth\r\nunto the present story, for that there be folk yet alive who would\r\ntake it in despite, whereas it should be passed over with a laugh.\r\nThis lady, then, seeing herself, though of high lineage, married to a\r\nwool-monger and unable, for that he was a craftsman, to put off the\r\nhaughtiness of her spirit, whereby she deemed no man of mean\r\ncondition, how rich soever he might be, worthy of a gentlewoman and\r\nseeing him moreover, for all his wealth, to be apt unto nothing of\r\nmore moment than to lay a warp for a piece of motley or let weave a\r\ncloth or chaffer with a spinster anent her yarn, resolved on no wise\r\nto admit of his embraces, save in so far as she might not deny him,\r\nbut to seek, for her own satisfaction, to find some one who should be\r\nworthier of her favours than the wool-monger appeared to her to be,\r\nand accordingly fell so fervently in love with a man of very good\r\nquality and middle age, that, whenas she saw him not by day, she could\r\nnot pass the ensuing night without unease. The gentleman, perceiving\r\nnot how the case stood, took no heed of her, and she, being very\r\ncircumspect, dared not make the matter known to him by sending of\r\nwomen nor by letter, fearing the possible perils that might betide.\r\nHowever, observing that he companied much with a churchman, who,\r\nalbeit a dull lump of a fellow, was nevertheless, for that he was a\r\nman of very devout life, reputed of well nigh all a most worthy friar,\r\nshe bethought herself that this latter would make an excellent\r\ngo-between herself and her lover and having considered what means she\r\nshould use, she repaired, at a fitting season, to the church where he\r\nabode, and letting call him to her, told him that, an he pleased, she\r\nwould fain confess herself to him. The friar seeing her and judging\r\nher to be a woman of condition, willingly gave ear to her, and she,\r\nafter confession, said to him, 'Father mine, it behoveth me have\r\nrecourse to you for aid and counsel anent that which you shall hear. I\r\nknow, as having myself told you, that you know my kinsfolk and my\r\nhusband, who loveth me more than his life, nor is there aught I desire\r\nbut I have it of him incontinent, he being a very rich man and one who\r\ncan well afford it; wherefore I love him more than mine own self and\r\nshould I but think, let alone do, aught that might be contrary to his\r\nhonour and pleasure, there were no woman more wicked or more deserving\r\nof the fire than I. Now one, whose name in truth I know not, but who\r\nis, meseemeth, a man of condition, and is, if I mistake not, much in\r\nyour company,--a well-favoured man and tall of his person and clad in\r\nvery decent sad-coloured raiment,--unaware belike of the constancy of\r\nmy purpose, appeareth to have laid siege to me, nor can I show myself\r\nat door or window nor go without the house, but he incontinent\r\npresenteth himself before me, and I marvel that he is not here now;\r\nwhereat I am sore concerned, for that such fashions as these often\r\nbring virtuous women into reproach, without their fault. I have whiles\r\nhad it in mind to have him told of this by my brothers; but then I\r\nhave bethought me that men oftentimes do messages on such wise that\r\nill answers ensue, which give rise to words and from words they come\r\nto deeds; wherefore, lest mischief spring therefrom and scandal, I\r\nhave kept silence of the matter and have determined to discover it to\r\nyourself rather than to another, at once because meseemeth you are his\r\nfriend and for that it beseemeth you to rebuke not only friends, but\r\nstrangers, of such things. I beseech you, therefore, for the one God's\r\nsake, that you rebuke him of this and pray him leave these his\r\nfashions. There be women enough, who incline belike to these toys and\r\nwould take pleasure in being dogged and courted by him, whereas to me,\r\nwho have no manner of mind to such matters, it is a very grievous\r\nannoy.' So saying, she bowed her head as she would weep. The holy\r\nfriar understood incontinent of whom she spoke and firmly believing\r\nwhat she said to be true, greatly commended her righteous intent and\r\npromised her to do on such wise that she should have no farther annoy\r\nfrom the person in question; and knowing her to be very rich, he\r\ncommended to her works of charity and almsdeeds, recounting to her his\r\nown need. Quoth the lady, 'I beseech you thereof for God's sake, and\r\nshould he deny, prithee scruple not to tell him that it was I who told\r\nyou this and complained to you thereof.' Then, having made her\r\nconfession and gotten her penance, recalling the friar's exhortations\r\nto works of almsgiving, she stealthily filled his hand with money,\r\npraying him to say masses for the souls of her dead kinsfolk; after\r\nwhich she rose from his feet and taking leave of him, returned home.\r\nNot long after up came the gentleman, according to his wont, and after\r\nthey had talked awhile of one thing and another, the friar, drawing\r\nhis friend aside, very civilly rebuked him of the manner in which, as\r\nhe believed, he pursued and spied upon the lady aforesaid, according\r\nto that which she had given him to understand. The other marvelled, as\r\nwell he might, having never set eyes upon her and being used very\r\nrarely to pass before her house, and would have excused himself; but\r\nthe friar suffered him not to speak, saying, 'Now make no show of\r\nwonderment nor waste words in denying it, for it will avail thee\r\nnothing; I learnt not these matters from the neighbours; nay, she\r\nherself told them to me, complaining sore of thee. And besides that\r\nsuch toys beseem not a man of thine age, I may tell thee this much of\r\nher, that if ever I saw a woman averse to these follies, it is she;\r\nwherefore, for thine own credit and her comfort, I prithee desist\r\ntherefrom and let her be in peace.' The gentleman, quicker of wit than\r\nthe friar, was not slow to apprehend the lady's device and feigning to\r\nbe somewhat abashed, promised to meddle no more with her\r\nthenceforward; then, taking leave of the friar, he betook himself to\r\nthe house of the lady, who still abode await at a little window, so\r\nshe might see him, should he pass that way. When she saw him come, she\r\nshowed herself so rejoiced and so gracious to him, that he might very\r\nwell understand that he had gathered the truth from the friar's words,\r\nand thenceforward, under colour of other business, he began with the\r\nutmost precaution to pass continually through the street, to his own\r\npleasure and to the exceeding delight and solace of the lady. After\r\nawhile, perceiving that she pleased him even as he pleased her and\r\nwishful to inflame him yet more and to certify him of the love she\r\nbore him, she betook herself again, choosing her time and place, to\r\nthe holy friar and seating herself at his feet in the church, fell\r\na-weeping. The friar, seeing this, asked her affectionately what was\r\nto do with her anew. 'Alack, father mine,' answered she, 'that which\r\naileth me is none other than yonder God-accursed friend of yours, of\r\nwhom I complained to you the other day, for that methinketh he was\r\nborn for my especial torment and to make me do a thing, such that I\r\nshould never be glad again nor ever after dare to seat myself at your\r\nfeet.' 'How?' cried the friar. 'Hath he not given over annoying thee?'\r\n'No, indeed,' answered she; 'nay, since I complained to you of him, as\r\nif of despite, maybe taking it ill that I should have done so, for\r\nevery once he used to pass before my house, I verily believe he hath\r\npassed seven times. And would to God he were content with passing and\r\nspying upon me! Nay, he is grown so bold and so malapert that but\r\nyesterday he despatched a woman to me at home with his idle tales and\r\ntoys and sent me a purse and a girdle, as if I had not purses and\r\ngirdles galore; the which I took and take so ill that I believe, but\r\nfor my having regard to the sin of it and after for the love of you, I\r\nhad played the devil. However, I contained myself and would not do or\r\nsay aught whereof I should not first have let you know. Nay, I had\r\nalready returned the purse and the girdle to the baggage who brought\r\nthem, that she might carry them back to him, and had given her a rough\r\ndismissal, but after, fearing she might keep them for herself and tell\r\nhim that I had accepted them, as I hear women of her fashion do\r\nwhiles, I called her back and took them, full of despite, from her\r\nhands and have brought them to you, so you may return them to him and\r\ntell him I want none of his trash, for that, thanks to God and my\r\nhusband, I have purses and girdles enough to smother him withal.\r\nMoreover, if hereafter he desist not from this, I tell you, as a\r\nfather, you must excuse me, but I will tell it, come what may, to my\r\nhusband and my brothers; for I had far liefer he should brook an\r\naffront, if needs he must, than that I should suffer blame for him;\r\nwherefore let him look to himself.' So saying, still weeping sore, she\r\npulled out from under her surcoat a very handsome and rich purse and a\r\nquaint and costly girdle and threw them into the lap of the friar,\r\nwho, fully crediting that which she told him and incensed beyond\r\nmeasure, took them and said to her, 'Daughter, I marvel not that thou\r\nart provoked at these doings, nor can I blame thee therefor; but I\r\nmuch commend thee for following my counsel in the matter. I rebuked\r\nhim the other day and he hath ill performed that which he promised me;\r\nwherefore, as well for that as for this that he hath newly done, I\r\nmean to warm his ears[158] for him after such a fashion that\r\nmethinketh he will give thee no farther concern; but do thou, God's\r\nbenison on thee, suffer not thyself to be so overcome with anger that\r\nthou tell it to any of thy folk, for that overmuch harm might ensue\r\nthereof unto him. Neither fear thou lest this blame anywise ensue to\r\nthee, for I shall still, before both God and men, be a most constant\r\nwitness to thy virtue.' The lady made believe to be somewhat comforted\r\nand leaving that talk, said, as one who knew his greed and that of his\r\nfellow-churchmen, 'Sir, these some nights past there have appeared to\r\nme sundry of my kinsfolk, who ask nought but almsdeeds, and meseemeth\r\nthey are indeed in exceeding great torment, especially my mother, who\r\nappeareth to me in such ill case and affliction that it is pity to\r\nbehold. Methinketh she suffereth exceeding distress to see me in this\r\ntribulation with yonder enemy of God; wherefore I would have you say\r\nme forty masses of Saint Gregory for her and their souls, together\r\nwith certain of your own prayers, so God may deliver them from that\r\npenitential fire.' So saying, she put a florin into his hand, which\r\nthe holy father blithely received and confirming her devoutness with\r\nfair words and store of pious instances, gave her his benison and let\r\nher go. The lady being gone, the friar, never thinking how he was\r\ngulled, sent for his friend, who, coming and finding him troubled, at\r\nonce divined that he was to have news of the lady and awaited what the\r\nfriar should say. The latter repeated that which he had before said to\r\nhim and bespeaking him anew angrily and reproachfully, rebuked him\r\nseverely of that which, according to the lady's report, he had done.\r\nThe gentleman, not yet perceiving the friar's drift, faintly enough\r\ndenied having sent her the purse and the girdle, so as not to\r\nundeceive the friar, in case the lady should have given him to believe\r\nthat he had done this; whereat the good man was sore incensed and\r\nsaid, 'How canst thou deny it, wicked man that thou art? See, here\r\nthey are, for she herself brought them to me, weeping; look if thou\r\nknowest them.' The gentleman feigned to be sore abashed and answered,\r\n'Yes, I do indeed know them and I confess to you that I did ill; but I\r\nswear to you, since I see her thus disposed, that you shall never more\r\nhear a word of this.' Brief, after many words, the numskull of a friar\r\ngave his friend the purse and the girdle and dismissed him, after\r\nrating him amain and beseeching him occupy himself no more with these\r\nfollies, the which he promised him. The gentleman, overjoyed both at\r\nthe assurance that himseemed he had of the lady's love and at the\r\ngoodly gift, was no sooner quit of the friar than he betook himself to\r\na place where he made shift to let his mistress see that he had the\r\none and the other thing; whereat she was mightily rejoiced, more by\r\ntoken that herseemed her device went from good to better. She now\r\nawaited nought but her husband's going abroad to give completion to\r\nthe work, and it befell not long after that it behoved him repair to\r\nGenoa on some occasion or other. No sooner had he mounted to horse in\r\nthe morning and gone his way, than the lady betook herself to the holy\r\nman and after many lamentations, said to him, weeping, 'Father mine,\r\nI tell you now plainly that I can brook no more; but, for that I\r\npromised you the other day to do nought, without first telling you, I\r\nam come to excuse myself to you; and that you may believe I have good\r\nreason both to weep and to complain, I will tell you what your friend,\r\nor rather devil incarnate, did to me this very morning, a little\r\nbefore matins. I know not what ill chance gave him to know that my\r\nhusband was to go to Genoa yestermorn; algates, this morning, at the\r\ntime I tell you, he came into a garden of mine and climbing up by a\r\ntree to the window of my bedchamber, which giveth upon the garden, had\r\nalready opened the lattice and was for entering, when I of a sudden\r\nawoke and starting up, offered to cry out, nay, would assuredly have\r\ncried out, but that he, who was not yet within, besought me of mercy\r\nin God's name and yours, telling me who he was; which when I heard, I\r\nheld my peace for the love of you and naked as I was born, ran and\r\nshut the window in his face; whereupon I suppose he took himself off\r\n(ill-luck go with him!), for I heard no more of him. Look you now if\r\nthis be a goodly thing and to be endured. For my part I mean to bear\r\nwith him no more; nay, I have already forborne him overmuch for the\r\nlove of you.' The friar, hearing this, was the wrathfullest man alive\r\nand knew not what to say, except to ask again and again if she had\r\nwell certified herself that it was indeed he and not another; to which\r\nshe answered, 'Praised be God! As if I did not yet know him from\r\nanother! I tell you it was himself, and although he should deny it,\r\ncredit him not.' Then said the friar, 'Daughter, there is nothing to\r\nbe said for it but that this was exceeding effrontery and a thing\r\nexceeding ill done, and in sending him off, as thou didst, thou didst\r\nthat which it behoved thee to do. But I beseech thee, since God hath\r\npreserved thee from shame, that, like as thou hast twice followed my\r\ncounsel, even so do thou yet this once; to wit, without complaining to\r\nany kinsman of thine, leave it to me to see an I can bridle yonder\r\ndevil broke loose, whom I believed a saint. If I can make shift to\r\nturn him from this lewdness, well and good; if not, I give thee leave\r\nhenceforth to do with him that which thy soul shall judge best, and my\r\nbenison go with thee.' 'Well, then,' answered the lady, 'for this once\r\nI will well not to vex or disobey you; but look you do on such wise\r\nthat he be ware of annoying me again, for I promise you I will never\r\nagain return to you for this cause.' Thereupon, without saying more,\r\nshe took leave of the friar and went away, as if in anger. Hardly was\r\nshe out of the church when up came the gentleman and was called by the\r\nfriar, who, taking him apart, gave him the soundest rating ever man\r\nhad, calling him disloyal and forsworn and traitor. The other, who had\r\nalready twice had occasion to know to what the monk's reprimands\r\namounted, abode expectant and studied with embarrassed answers to make\r\nhim speak out, saying, at the first, 'Why all this passion, Sir? Have\r\nI crucified Christ?' Whereupon, 'Mark this shameless fellow!' cried\r\nthe friar. 'Hear what he saith! He speaketh as if a year or two were\r\npassed and he had for lapse of time forgotten his misdeeds and his\r\nlewdness! Hath it then escaped thy mind between this and matinsong\r\nthat thou hast outraged some one this very morning? Where wast thou\r\nthis morning a little before day?' 'I know not,' answered the\r\ngentleman; 'but wherever it was, the news thereof hath reached you\r\nmighty early.' Quoth the friar, 'Certes, the news hath reached me.\r\nDoubtless thou supposedst because her husband was abroad, that needs\r\nmust the gentlewoman receive thee incontinent in her arms. A fine\r\nthing, indeed! Here's a pretty fellow! Here's an honourable man! He's\r\ngrown a nighthawk, a garden-breaker, a tree-climber! Thinkest thou by\r\nimportunity to overcome this lady's chastity, that thou climbest up to\r\nher windows anights by the trees? There is nought in the world so\r\ndispleasing to her as thou; yet must thou e'en go essaying it again\r\nand again. Truly, thou hast profited finely by my admonitions, let\r\nalone that she hath shown thee her aversion in many ways. But this I\r\nhave to say to thee; she hath up to now, not for any love she beareth\r\nthee, but at my instant entreaty, kept silence of that which thou hast\r\ndone; but she will do so no more; I have given her leave to do what\r\nseemeth good to her, an thou annoy her again in aught. What wilt thou\r\ndo, an she tell her brothers?' The gentleman having now gathered\r\nenough of that which it concerned him to know, appeased the friar, as\r\nbest he knew and might, with many and ample promises, and taking leave\r\nof him, waited till matinsong[159] of the ensuing night, when he made\r\nhis way into the garden and climbed up by the tree to the window. He\r\nfound the lattice open and entering the chamber as quickliest he\r\nmight, threw himself into the arms of his fair mistress, who, having\r\nawaited him with the utmost impatience, received him joyfully, saying,\r\n'Gramercy to my lord the friar for that he so well taught thee the way\r\nhither!' Then, taking their pleasure one of the other, they solaced\r\nthemselves together with great delight, devising and laughing amain\r\nanent the simplicity of the dolt of a friar and gibing at wool-hanks\r\nand teasels and carding-combs. Moreover, having taken order for their\r\nfuture converse, they did on such wise that, without having to resort\r\nanew to my lord the friar, they foregathered in equal joyance many\r\nanother night, to the like whereof I pray God, of His holy mercy,\r\nspeedily to conduct me and all Christian souls who have a mind\r\nthereto.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: Lit.

Being\r\nan ignorant, clod-pated fellow, he said his paternosters, went to\r\npreachments and attended mass, nor ever failed to be at the Lauds\r\nchanted by the seculars,[161] and fasted and mortified himself; nay,\r\nit was buzzed about that he was of the Flagellants.[162] His wife,\r\nwhose name was Mistress Isabetta,[163] a woman, yet young, of\r\neight-and-twenty to thirty years of age, fresh and fair and plump as a\r\nlady-apple, kept, by reason of the piety and belike of the age of her\r\nhusband, much longer and more frequent fasts than she could have\r\nwished, and when she would have slept or maybe frolicked with him, he\r\nrecounted to her the life of Christ and the preachments of Fra\r\nNastagio or the Complaint of Mary Magdalene or the like. Meantime\r\nthere returned home from Paris a monk hight Dom[164] Felice,\r\nConventual[165] of San Pancrazio, who was young and comely enough of\r\nperson, keen of wit and a profound scholar, and with him Fra Puccio\r\ncontracted a strait friendship. And for that this Dom Felice right\r\nwell resolved him his every doubt and knowing his pious turn of mind,\r\nmade him a show of exceeding devoutness, Fra Puccio fell to carrying\r\nhim home bytimes and giving him to dine and sup, as the occasion\r\noffered; and the lady also, for her husband's sake, became familiar\r\nwith him and willingly did him honour. The monk, then, continuing to\r\nfrequent Fra Puccio's house and seeing the latter's wife so fresh and\r\nplump, guessed what should be the thing whereof she suffered the most\r\ndefault and bethought himself, an he might, to go about to furnish her\r\nwithal himself, and so spare Fra Puccio fatigue. Accordingly, craftily\r\ncasting his eyes on her, at one time and another, he made shift to\r\nkindle in her breast that same desire which he had himself, which when\r\nhe saw, he bespoke her of his wishes as first occasion betided him.\r\nBut, albeit he found her well disposed to give effect to the work, he\r\ncould find no means thereunto, for that she would on nowise trust\r\nherself to be with him in any place in the world save her own house,\r\nand there it might not be, seeing that Fra Puccio never went without\r\nthe town. At this the monk was sore chagrined; but, after much\r\nconsideration, he hit upon a device whereby he might avail to\r\nforegather with the lady in her own house, without suspect, for all\r\nFra Puccio should be at home. Accordingly, the latter coming one day\r\nto visit him, he bespoke him thus, 'I have many a time understood, Fra\r\nPuccio, that all thy desire is to become a saint and to this end\r\nmeseemeth thou goest about by a long road, whereas there is another\r\nand a very short one, which the Pope and the other great prelates, who\r\nknow and practise it, will not have made known, for that the clergy,\r\nwho for the most part live by alms, would incontinent be undone,\r\ninasmuch as the laity would no longer trouble themselves to propitiate\r\nthem with alms or otherwhat. But, for that thou art my friend and hast\r\nvery honourably entertained me, I would teach it thee, so I were\r\nassured thou wouldst practise it and wouldst not discover it to any\r\nliving soul.' Fra Puccio, eager to know the thing, began straightway\r\nto entreat him with the utmost instancy that he would teach it him and\r\nthen to swear that never, save in so far as it should please him,\r\nwould he tell it to any, engaging, an if it were such as he might\r\navail to follow, to address himself thereunto. Whereupon quoth the\r\nmonk, 'Since thou promisest me this, I will e'en discover it to thee.\r\nThou must know that the doctors of the church hold that it behoveth\r\nwhoso would become blessed to perform the penance which thou shalt\r\nhear; but understand me aright; I do not say that, after the penance,\r\nthou wilt not be a sinner like as thou presently art; but this will\r\nbetide, that the sins which thou hast committed up to the time of the\r\npenance will all by virtue thereof be purged and pardoned unto thee,\r\nand those which thou shalt commit thereafterward will not be written\r\nto thy prejudice, but will pass away with the holy water, as venial\r\nsins do now. It behoveth a man, then, in the first place, whenas he\r\ncometh to begin the penance, to confess himself with the utmost\r\ndiligence of his sins, and after this he must keep a fast and a very\r\nstrict abstinence for the space of forty days, during which time\r\nthou[166] must abstain from touching, not to say other women, but even\r\nthine own wife. Moreover, thou must have in thine own house some place\r\nwhence thou mayst see the sky by night, whither thou must betake\r\nthyself towards the hour of complines,[167] and there thou must have a\r\nwide plank set up, on such wise that, standing upright, thou mayst\r\nlean thy loins against it and keeping thy feet on the ground, stretch\r\nout thine arms, crucifix fashion. An thou wouldst rest them upon some\r\npeg or other, thou mayst do it, and on this wise thou must abide\r\ngazing upon the sky, without budging a jot, till matins. Wert thou a\r\nscholar, thou wouldst do well to repeat certain orisons I would give\r\nthee; but, as thou art it not, thou must say three hundred\r\nPaternosters and as many Ave Marys, in honour of the Trinity, and\r\nlooking upon heaven, still have in remembrance that God is the Creator\r\nof heaven and earth and the passion of Christ, abiding on such wise as\r\nHe abode on the cross. When the bell ringeth to matins, thou mayst, an\r\nthou wilt, go and cast thyself, clad as thou art, on thy bed and\r\nsleep, and after, in the forenoon, betake thyself to church and there\r\nhear at least three masses and repeat fifty Paternosters and as many\r\nAves; after which thou shalt with a single heart do all and sundry\r\nthine occasions, if thou have any to do, and dine and at evensong be\r\nin church again and there say certain orisons which I will give thee\r\nby writ and without which it cannot be done. Then, towards complines,\r\ndo thou return to the fashion aforesaid, and thus doing, even as I\r\nhave myself done aforetime, I doubt not but, ere thou come to the end\r\nof the penance, thou wilt, (provided thou shalt have performed it with\r\ndevoutness and compunction,) feel somewhat marvellous of eternal\r\nbeatitude.' Quoth Fra Puccio, 'This is no very burdensome matter, nor\r\nyet overlong, and may very well be done; wherefore I purpose in God's\r\nname to begin on Sunday.' Then, taking leave of him and returning\r\nhome, he related everything in due order to his wife, having the\r\nother's permission therefor. The lady understood very well what the\r\nmonk meant by bidding him stand fast without stirring till matins;\r\nwherefore, the device seeming to her excellent, she replied that she\r\nwas well pleased therewith and with every other good work that he did\r\nfor the health of his soul and that, so God might make the penance\r\nprofitable to him, she would e'en fast with him, but do no more. They\r\nbeing thus of accord and Sunday come, Fra Puccio began his penance and\r\nmy lord monk, having agreed with the lady, came most evenings to sup\r\nwith her, bringing with him store of good things to eat and drink, and\r\nafter lay with her till matinsong, when he arose and took himself off,\r\nwhilst Fra Puccio returned to bed. Now the place which Fra Puccio had\r\nchosen for his penance adjoined the chamber where the lady lay and was\r\nparted therefrom but by a very slight wall, wherefore, Master Monk\r\nwantoning it one night overfreely with the lady and she with him, it\r\nseemed to Fra Puccio that he felt a shaking of the floor of the house.\r\nAccordingly, having by this said an hundred of his Paternosters, he\r\nmade a stop there and without moving, called to his wife to know what\r\nshe did. The lady, who was of a waggish turn and was then belike\r\nastride of San Benedetto his beast or that of San Giovanni Gualberto,\r\nanswered, 'I' faith, husband mine, I toss as most I may.' 'How?'\r\nquoth Fra Puccio. 'Thou tossest? What meaneth this tossing?' The lady,\r\nlaughing, for that she was a frolicsome dame and doubtless had cause\r\nto laugh, answered merrily; 'How? You know not what it meaneth? Why, I\r\nhave heard you say a thousand times, \"Who suppeth not by night must\r\ntoss till morning light.\"' Fra Puccio doubted not but that the fasting\r\nwas the cause of her unableness to sleep and it was for this she\r\ntossed thus about the bed; wherefore, in the simplicity of his heart,\r\n'Wife,' said he, 'I told thee not to fast; but, since thou wouldst\r\ne'en do it, think not of that, but address thyself to rest; thou\r\ngivest such vaults about the bed that thou makest all in the place\r\nshake.' 'Have no care for that,' answered the lady; 'I know what I am\r\nabout; do you but well, you, and I will do as well as I may.' Fra\r\nPuccio, accordingly, held his peace and betook himself anew to his\r\nPaternosters; and after that night my lord monk and the lady let make\r\na bed in another part of the house, wherein they abode in the utmost\r\njoyance what while Fra Puccio's penance lasted. At one and the same\r\nhour the monk took himself off and the lady returned to her own bed,\r\nwhereto a little after came Fra Puccio from his penance; and on this\r\nwise the latter continued to do penance, whilst his wife did her\r\ndelight with the monk, to whom quoth she merrily, now and again, 'Thou\r\nhast put Fra Puccio upon performing a penance, whereby we have gotten\r\nParadise.' Indeed, the lady, finding herself in good case, took such a\r\nliking to the monk's fare, having been long kept on low diet by her\r\nhusband, that, whenas Fra Puccio's penance was accomplished, she still\r\nfound means to feed her fill with him elsewhere and using discretion,\r\nlong took her pleasure thereof. Thus, then, that my last words may not\r\nbe out of accord with my first, it came to pass that, whereas Fra\r\nPuccio, by doing penance, thought to win Paradise for himself, he put\r\ntherein the monk, who had shown him the speedy way thither, and his\r\nwife, who lived with him in great lack of that whereof Dom Felice,\r\nlike a charitable man as he was, vouchsafed her great plenty.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: _i.e._ a lay brother or affiliate.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: _i.e._ the canticles of praise chanted by certain lay\r\nconfraternities, established for that purpose and answering to our\r\npræ-Reformation Laudsingers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: An order of lay penitents, who were wont at certain\r\ntimes to go masked about the streets, scourging themselves in\r\nexpiation of the sins of the people.

She, rather tartly than otherwise, not out of\r\nmalice, but of old habit, began to speak thus, \"Many folk, knowing\r\nmuch, imagine that others know nothing, and so ofttimes, what while\r\nthey think to overreach others, find, after the event, that they\r\nthemselves have been outwitted of them; wherefore I hold his folly\r\ngreat who setteth himself without occasion to test the strength of\r\nanother's wit. But, for that maybe all are not of my opinion, it\r\npleaseth me, whilst following on the given order of the discourse, to\r\nrelate to you that which befell a Pistolese gentleman[168] by reason\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: _i.e._ a gentleman of Pistoia.]\r\n\r\nThere was in Pistoia a gentleman of the Vergellesi family, by name\r\nMesser Francesco, a man of great wealth and understanding and well\r\nadvised in all else, but covetous beyond measure. Being made provost\r\nof Milan, he had furnished himself with everything necessary for his\r\nhonourable going thither, except only with a palfrey handsome enough\r\nfor him, and finding none to his liking, he abode in concern thereof.\r\nNow there was then in the same town a young man called Ricciardo, of\r\nlittle family, but very rich, who still went so quaintly clad and so\r\nbrave of his person that he was commonly known as Il Zima,[169] and he\r\nhad long in vain loved and courted Messer Francesco's wife, who was\r\nexceeding fair and very virtuous. Now he had one of the handsomest\r\npalfreys in all Tuscany and set great store by it for its beauty and\r\nit being public to every one that he was enamoured of Messer\r\nFrancesco's wife, there were those who told the latter that, should he\r\nask it, he might have the horse for the love Il Zima bore his lady.\r\nAccordingly, moved by covetise, Messer Francesco let call Il Zima to\r\nhim and sought of him his palfrey by way of sale, so he should proffer\r\nit to him as a gift. The other, hearing this, was well pleased and\r\nmade answer to him, saying, \"Sir, though you gave me all you have in\r\nthe world, you might not avail to have my palfrey by way of sale, but\r\nby way of gift you may have it, whenas it pleaseth you, on condition\r\nthat, ere you take it, I may have leave to speak some words with your\r\nlady in your presence, but so far removed from every one that I may be\r\nheard of none other than herself.' The gentleman, urged by avarice and\r\nlooking to outwit the other, answered that it liked him well and [that\r\nhe might speak with her] as much as he would; then, leaving him in the\r\nsaloon of his palace, he betook himself to the lady's chamber and\r\ntelling her how easily he might acquire the palfrey, bade her come\r\nhearken to Il Zima, but charged her take good care to answer neither\r\nlittle or much to aught that he should say. To this the lady much\r\ndemurred, but, it behoving her ensue her husband's pleasure, she\r\npromised to do his bidding and followed him to the saloon, to hear\r\nwhat Il Zima should say. The latter, having renewed his covenant with\r\nthe gentleman, seated himself with the lady in a part of the saloon at\r\na great distance from every one and began to say thus, 'Noble lady,\r\nmeseemeth certain that you have too much wit not to have long since\r\nperceived how great a love I have been brought to bear you by your\r\nbeauty, which far transcendeth that of any woman whom methinketh I\r\never beheld, to say nothing of the engaging manners and the peerless\r\nvirtues which be in you and which might well avail to take the\r\nloftiest spirits of mankind; wherefore it were needless to declare to\r\nyou in words that this [my love] is the greatest and most fervent that\r\never man bore woman; and thus, without fail, will I do[170] so long as\r\nmy wretched life shall sustain these limbs, nay, longer; for that, if\r\nin the other world folk love as they do here below, I shall love you\r\nto all eternity. Wherefore you may rest assured that you have nothing,\r\nbe it much or little worth, that you may hold so wholly yours and\r\nwhereon you may in every wise so surely reckon as myself, such as I\r\nam, and that likewise which is mine. And that of this you may take\r\nassurance by very certain argument, I tell you that I should count\r\nmyself more graced, did you command me somewhat that I might do and\r\nthat would pleasure you, than if, I commanding, all the world should\r\npromptliest obey me. Since, then, I am yours, even as you have heard,\r\nit is not without reason that I dare to offer up my prayers to your\r\nnobility, wherefrom alone can all peace, all health and all well-being\r\nderive for me, and no otherwhence; yea, as the humblest of your\r\nservants, I beseech you, dear my good and only hope of my soul, which,\r\nmidmost the fire of love, feedeth upon its hope in you,--that your\r\nbenignity may be so great and your past rigour shown unto me, who am\r\nyours, on such wise be mollified that I, recomforted by your kindness,\r\nmay say that, like as by your beauty I was stricken with love, even so\r\nby your pity have I life, which latter, an your haughty soul incline\r\nnot to my prayers, will without fail come to nought and I shall perish\r\nand you may be said to be my murderer. Letting be that my death will\r\ndo you no honour, I doubt not eke but that, conscience bytimes\r\npricking you therefor, you will regret having wrought it[171] and\r\nwhiles, better disposed, will say in yourself, \"Alack, how ill I did\r\nnot to have compassion upon my poor Zima!\" and this repentance, being\r\nof no avail, will cause you the great annoy. Wherefore, so this may\r\nnot betide, now that you have it in your power to succour me, bethink\r\nyourself and ere I die, be moved to pity on me, for that with you\r\nalone it resteth to make me the happiest or the most miserable man\r\nalive. I trust your courtesy will be such that you will not suffer me\r\nto receive death in guerdon of such and so great a love, but will with\r\na glad response and full of favour quicken my fainting spirits, which\r\nflutter, all dismayed, in your presence.' Therewith he held his peace\r\nand heaving the deepest of sighs, followed up with sundry tears,\r\nproceeded to await the lady's answer. The latter,--whom the long court\r\nhe had paid her, the joustings held and the serenades given in her\r\nhonour and other like things done of him for the love of her had not\r\navailed to move,--was moved by the passionate speech of this most\r\nardent lover and began to be sensible of that which she had never yet\r\nfelt, to wit, what manner of thing love was; and albeit, in ensuance\r\nof the commandment laid upon her by her husband, she kept silence, she\r\ncould not withal hinder sundry gentle sighs from discovering that\r\nwhich, in answer to Il Zima, she would gladly have made manifest. Il\r\nZima, having waited awhile and seeing that no response ensued, was\r\nwondered and presently began to divine the husband's device; but yet,\r\nlooking her in the face and observing certain flashes of her eyes\r\ntowards him now and again and noting, moreover, the sighs which she\r\nsuffered not to escape her bosom with all her strength, conceived\r\nfresh hope and heartened thereby, took new counsel[172] and proceeded\r\nto answer himself after the following fashion, she hearkening the\r\nwhile: 'Zima mine, this long time, in good sooth, have I perceived thy\r\nlove for me to be most great and perfect, and now by thy words I know\r\nit yet better and am well pleased therewith, as indeed I should be.\r\nAlgates, an I have seemed to thee harsh and cruel, I will not have\r\nthee believe that I have at heart been that which I have shown myself\r\nin countenance; nay, I have ever loved thee and held thee dear above\r\nall other men; but thus hath it behoved me do, both for fear of others\r\nand for the preserving of my fair fame. But now is the time at hand\r\nwhen I may show thee clearly that I love thee and guerdon thee of the\r\nlove that thou hast borne and bearest me. Take comfort, therefore, and\r\nbe of good hope, for that a few days hence Messer Francesco is to go\r\nto Milan for provost, as indeed thou knowest, who hast for the love of\r\nme given him thy goodly palfrey; and whenas he shall be gone, I\r\npromise thee by my troth and of the true love I bear thee, that,\r\nbefore many days, thou shalt without fail foregather with me and we\r\nwill give gladsome and entire accomplishment to our love. And that I\r\nmay not have to bespeak thee otherwhiles of the matter, I tell thee\r\npresently that, whenas thou shalt see two napkins displayed at the\r\nwindow of my chamber, which giveth upon our garden, do thou that same\r\nevening at nightfall make shift to come to me by the garden door,\r\ntaking good care that thou be not seen. Thou wilt find me awaiting\r\nthee and we will all night long have delight and pleasance one of\r\nanother, to our hearts' content.' Having thus spoken for the lady, he\r\nbegan again to speak in his own person and rejoined on this wise,\r\n'Dearest lady, my every sense is so transported with excessive joy for\r\nyour gracious reply that I can scarce avail to make response, much\r\nless to render you due thanks; nay, could I e'en speak as I desire,\r\nthere is no term so long that it might suffice me fully to thank you\r\nas I would fain do and as it behoveth me; wherefore I leave it to your\r\ndiscreet consideration to imagine that which, for all my will, I am\r\nunable to express in words. This much only I tell you that I will\r\nwithout fail bethink myself to do as you have charged me, and being\r\nthen, peradventure, better certified of so great a grace as that which\r\nyou have vouchsafed me, I will, as best I may, study to render you the\r\nutmost thanks in my power. For the nonce there abideth no more to say;\r\nwherefore, dearest lady mine, God give you that gladness and that weal\r\nwhich you most desire, and so to Him I commend you.' For all this the\r\nlady said not a word; whereupon Il Zima arose and turned towards the\r\nhusband, who, seeing him risen, came up to him and said, laughing 'How\r\ndeemest thou? Have I well performed my promise to thee?' 'Nay, sir'\r\nanswered Il Zima; 'for you promised to let me speak with your lady and\r\nyou have caused me speak with a marble statue.' These words were\r\nmighty pleasing to the husband, who, for all he had a good opinion of\r\nthe lady, conceived of her a yet better and said, 'Now is thy palfrey\r\nfairly mine.' 'Ay is it, sir,' replied Il Zima, 'but, had I thought to\r\nreap of this favour received of you such fruit as I have gotten, I had\r\ngiven you the palfrey, without asking it[173] of you; and would God I\r\nhad done it, for that now you have bought the palfrey and I have not\r\nsold it.' The other laughed at this and being now provided with a\r\npalfrey, set out upon his way a few days after and betook himself to\r\nMilan, to enter upon the Provostship. The lady, left free in her\r\nhouse, called to mind Il Zima's words and the love he bore her and the\r\npalfrey given for her sake and seeing him pass often by the house,\r\nsaid in herself, 'What do I? Why waste I my youth? Yonder man is gone\r\nto Milan and will not return these six months. When will he ever\r\nrender me them[174] again? When I am old? Moreover, when shall I ever\r\nfind such a lover as Il Zima? I am alone and have no one to fear. I\r\nknow not why I should not take this good opportunity what while I may;\r\nI shall not always have such leisure as I presently have. None will\r\nknow the thing, and even were it to be known, it is better to do and\r\nrepent, than to abstain and repent.' Having thus taken counsel with\r\nherself, she one day set two napkins in the garden window, even as Il\r\nZima had said, which when he saw, he was greatly rejoiced and no\r\nsooner was the night come than he betook himself, secretly and alone,\r\nto the gate of the lady's garden and finding it open, passed on to\r\nanother door that opened into the house, where he found his mistress\r\nawaiting him. She, seeing him come, started up to meet him and\r\nreceived him with the utmost joy, whilst he clipped and kissed her an\r\nhundred thousand times and followed her up the stair to her chamber,\r\nwhere, getting them to bed without a moment's delay, they knew the\r\nutmost term of amorous delight. Nor was this first time the last, for\r\nthat, what while the gentleman abode at Milan and even after his\r\ncoming back, Il Zima returned thither many another time, to the\r\nexceeding satisfaction of both parties.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: Lit. \"The summit,\" or in modern slang \"The tiptop,\"\r\n_i.e._ the pink of fashion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 170: _i.e._ this love shall I bear you.

Albeit he had to wife a very fair and lovesome young lady,\r\nhe fell in love with one who, according to general opinion, far\r\noverpassed in beauty all the other ladies of Naples. Her name was\r\nCatella and she was the wife of another young gentleman of like\r\ncondition, hight Filippello Fighinolfi, whom, like a very virtuous\r\nwoman as she was, she loved and cherished over all. Ricciardo, then,\r\nloving this Catella and doing all those things whereby the love and\r\nfavour of a lady are commonly to be won, yet for all that availing not\r\nto compass aught of his desire, was like to despair; and unknowing or\r\nunable to rid him of his passion, he neither knew how to die nor did\r\nit profit him to live.\r\n\r\nAbiding in this mind, it befell that he was one day urgently exhorted\r\nby certain ladies of his kinsfolk to renounce this passion of his,\r\nseeing he did but weary himself in vain, for that Catella had none\r\nother good than Filippello, of whom she lived in such jealousy that\r\nshe fancied every bird that flew through the air would take him from\r\nher. Ricciardo, hearing of Catella's jealousy, forthright bethought\r\nhimself how he might compass his wishes and accordingly proceeded to\r\nfeign himself in despair of her love and to have therefore set his\r\nmind upon another lady, for whose love he began to make a show of\r\njousting and tourneying and doing all those things which he had been\r\nused to do for Catella; nor did he do this long before well nigh all\r\nthe Neapolitans, and among the rest the lady herself, were persuaded\r\nthat he no longer loved Catella, but was ardently enamoured of this\r\nsecond lady; and on this wise he persisted until it was so firmly\r\nbelieved not only of others, but of Catella herself, that the latter\r\nlaid aside a certain reserve with which she was wont to entreat him,\r\nby reason of the love he bore her, and coming and going, saluted him\r\nfamiliarly, neighbourwise, as she did others.\r\n\r\nIt presently befell that, the weather being warm, many companies of\r\nladies and gentlemen went, according to the usance of the Neapolitans,\r\nto divert themselves on the banks of the sea and there to dine and\r\nsup, and Ricciardo, knowing Catella to be gone thither with her\r\ncompany, betook himself to the same place with his friends and was\r\nreceived into Catella's party of ladies, after allowing himself to be\r\nmuch pressed, as if he had no great mind to abide there. The ladies\r\nand Catella fell to rallying him upon his new love, and he, feigning\r\nhimself sore inflamed therewith, gave them the more occasion for\r\ndiscourse. Presently, one lady going hither and thither, as commonly\r\nhappeneth in such places, and Catella being left with a few whereas\r\nRicciardo was, the latter cast at her a hint of a certain amour of\r\nFilippello her husband, whereupon she fell into a sudden passion of\r\njealousy and began to be inwardly all afire with impatience to know\r\nwhat he meant. At last, having contained herself awhile and being\r\nunable to hold out longer, she besought Ricciardo, for that lady's\r\nsake whom he most loved, to be pleased to make her clear[175] of that\r\nwhich he had said of Filippello; whereupon quoth he, 'You conjure me\r\nby such a person that I dare not deny aught you ask me; wherefore I am\r\nready to tell it you, so but you promise me that you will never say a\r\nword thereof either to him or to any other, save whenas you shall by\r\nexperience have seen that which I shall tell you to be true; for that,\r\nwhen you please, I will teach you how you may see it.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 175: Or, in modern parlance, to enlighten her.]\r\n\r\nThe lady consented to that which he asked and swore to him never to\r\nrepeat that which he should tell her, believing it the more to be\r\ntrue. Then, withdrawing apart with her, so they might not be overheard\r\nof any, he proceeded to say thus: 'Madam, an I loved you as once I\r\nloved, I should not dare tell you aught which I thought might vex you;\r\nbut, since that love is passed away, I shall be less chary of\r\ndiscovering to you the whole truth. I know not if Filippello have ever\r\ntaken umbrage at the love I bore you or have believed that I was ever\r\nloved of you. Be this as it may, he hath never personally shown me\r\naught thereof; but now, having peradventure awaited a time whenas he\r\ndeemed I should be less suspicious, it seemeth he would fain do unto\r\nme that which I misdoubt me he feareth I have done unto him, to wit,\r\n[he seeketh] to have my wife at his pleasure. As I find, he hath for\r\nsome little time past secretly solicited her with sundry messages, all\r\nof which I have known from herself, and she hath made answer thereunto\r\naccording as I have enjoined her. This very day, however, ere I came\r\nhither, I found in the house, in close conference with my wife, a\r\nwoman whom I set down incontinent for that which she was, wherefore I\r\ncalled my wife and asked her what the woman wanted. Quoth she, \"She is\r\nthe agent of Filippello, with whom thou hast saddled me, by dint of\r\nmaking me answer him and give him hopes, and she saith that he will\r\ne'en know once for all what I mean to do and that, an I will, he\r\nwould contrive for me to be privily at a bagnio in this city; nay, of\r\nthis he prayeth and importuneth me; and hadst thou not, I know not\r\nwhy, caused me keep this traffic with him, I would have rid myself of\r\nhim after such a fashion that he should never more have looked whereas\r\nI might be.\" Thereupon meseemed this was going too far and that it was\r\nno longer to be borne; and I bethought myself to tell it to you, so\r\nyou might know how he requiteth that entire fidelity of yours, whereby\r\naforetime I was nigh upon death. And so you shall not believe this\r\nthat I tell you to be words and fables, but may, whenas you have a\r\nmind thereto, openly both see and touch it, I caused my wife make this\r\nanswer to her who awaited it, that she was ready to be at the bagnio\r\nin question to-morrow at none, whenas the folk sleep; with which the\r\nwoman took leave of her, very well pleased. Now methinketh not you\r\nbelieve that I will send my wife thither; but, were I in your place, I\r\nwould contrive that he should find me there in the room of her he\r\nthinketh to meet, and whenas I had abidden with him awhile, I would\r\ngive him to know with whom he had been and render him such honour\r\nthereof as should beseem him; by which means methinketh you would do\r\nhim such a shame that the affront he would fain put upon yourself and\r\nupon me would at one blow be avenged.'\r\n\r\nCatella, hearing this, without anywise considering who it was that\r\nsaid it to her or suspecting his design, forthright, after the wont of\r\njealous folk, gave credence to his words and fell a-fitting to his\r\nstory certain things that had already befallen; then, fired with\r\nsudden anger, she answered that she would certainly do as he\r\ncounselled,--it was no such great matter,--and that assuredly, if\r\nFilippello came thither, she would do him such a shame that it should\r\nstill recur to his mind, as often as he saw a woman. Ricciardo, well\r\npleased at this and himseeming his device was a good one and in a fair\r\nway of success, confirmed her in her purpose with many other words and\r\nstrengthened her belief in his story, praying her, natheless, never to\r\nsay that she had heard it from him, the which she promised him on her\r\ntroth.\r\n\r\nNext morning, Ricciardo betook himself to a good woman, who kept the\r\nbagnio he had named to Catella, and telling her what he purposed to\r\ndo, prayed her to further him therein as most she might. The good\r\nwoman, who was much beholden to him, answered that she would well and\r\nagreed with him what she should do and say. Now in the house where the\r\nbagnio was she had a very dark chamber, for that no window gave\r\nthereon by which the light might enter. This chamber she made ready\r\nand spread a bed there, as best she might, wherein Ricciardo, as soon\r\nas he had dined, laid himself and proceeded to await Catella. The\r\nlatter, having heard Ricciardo's words and giving more credence\r\nthereto than behoved her, returned in the evening, full of despite, to\r\nher house, whither Filippello also returned and being by chance full\r\nof other thought, maybe did not show her his usual fondness. When she\r\nsaw this, her suspicions rose yet higher and she said in herself,\r\n'Forsooth, his mind is occupied with yonder lady with whom he thinketh\r\nto take his pleasure to-morrow; but of a surety this shall not come to\r\npass.' An in this thought she abode well nigh all that night,\r\nconsidering how she should bespeak him, whenas she should be with him\r\n[in the bagnio].\r\n\r\nWhat more [need I say?] The hour of none come, she took her\r\nwaiting-woman and without anywise changing counsel, repaired to the\r\nbagnio that Ricciardo had named to her, and there finding the good\r\nwoman, asked her if Filippello had been there that day, whereupon\r\nquoth the other, who had been duly lessoned by Ricciardo, 'Are you the\r\nlady that should come to speak with him?' 'Ay am I,' answered Catella.\r\n'Then,' said the woman, 'get you in to him.' Catella, who went seeking\r\nthat which she would fain not have found, caused herself to be brought\r\nto the chamber where Ricciardo was and entering with covered head,\r\nlocked herself in. Ricciardo, seeing her enter, rose joyfully to his\r\nfeet and catching her in his arms, said softly, 'Welcome, my soul!'\r\nWhilst she, the better to feign herself other than she was, clipped\r\nhim and kissed him and made much of him, without saying a word,\r\nfearing to be known of him if she should speak. The chamber was very\r\ndark, wherewith each of them was well pleased, nor for long abiding\r\nthere did the eyes recover more power. Ricciardo carried her to the\r\nbed and there, without speaking, lest their voices should betray them,\r\nthey abode a long while, to the greater delight and pleasance of the\r\none party than the other.\r\n\r\nBut presently, it seeming to Catella time to vent the resentment she\r\nfelt, she began, all afire with rage and despite, to speak thus,\r\n'Alas, how wretched is women's lot and how ill bestowed the love that\r\nmany of them bear their husbands! I, unhappy that I am, these eight\r\nyears have I loved thee more than my life, and thou, as I have felt,\r\nart all afire and all consumed with love of a strange woman, wicked\r\nand perverse man that thou art! Now with whom thinkest thou to have\r\nbeen? Thou hast been with her whom thou hast too long beguiled with\r\nthy false blandishments, making a show of love to her and being\r\nenamoured elsewhere. I am Catella, not Ricciardo's wife, disloyal\r\ntraitor that thou art! Hearken if thou know my voice; it is indeed I;\r\nand it seemeth to me a thousand years till we be in the light, so I\r\nmay shame thee as thou deservest, scurvy discredited cur that thou\r\nart! Alack, woe is me! To whom have I borne so much love these many\r\nyears? To this disloyal dog, who, thinking to have a strange woman in\r\nhis arms, hath lavished on me more caresses and more fondnesses in\r\nthis little while I have been here with him than in all the rest of\r\nthe time I have been his. Thou hast been brisk enough to-day, renegade\r\ncur that thou art, that usest at home to show thyself so feeble and\r\nforspent and impotent; but, praised be God, thou hast tilled thine own\r\nfield and not, as thou thoughtest, that of another. No wonder thou\r\ncamest not anigh me yesternight; thou lookedst to discharge thee of\r\nthy lading elsewhere and wouldst fain come fresh to the battle; but,\r\nthanks to God and my own foresight, the stream hath e'en run in its\r\ndue channel. Why answerest thou not, wicked man? Why sayst thou not\r\nsomewhat? Art thou grown dumb, hearing me? Cock's faith, I know not\r\nwhat hindereth me from thrusting my hands into thine eyes and tearing\r\nthem out for thee. Thou thoughtest to do this treason very secretly;\r\nbut, perdie, one knoweth as much as another; thou hast not availed to\r\ncompass thine end; I have had better beagles at thy heels than thou\r\nthoughtest.'\r\n\r\nRicciardo inwardly rejoiced at these words and without making any\r\nreply, clipped her and kissed her and fondled her more than ever;\r\nwhereupon quoth she, following on her speech, 'Ay, thou thinkest to\r\ncajole me with thy feigned caresses, fashious dog that thou art, and\r\nto appease and console me; but thou art mistaken; I shall never be\r\ncomforted for this till I have put thee to shame therefor in the\r\npresence of all our friends and kinsmen and neighbours. Am I not as\r\nfair as Ricciardo's wife, thou villain? Am I not as good a\r\ngentlewoman? Why dost thou not answer, thou sorry dog? What hath she\r\nmore than I? Keep thy distance; touch me not; thou hast done enough\r\nfeats of arms for to-day. Now thou knowest who I am, I am well assured\r\nthat all thou couldst do would be perforce; but, so God grant me\r\ngrace, I will yet cause thee suffer want thereof, and I know not what\r\nhindereth me from sending for Ricciardo, who hath loved me more than\r\nhimself and could never boast that I once even looked at him; nor know\r\nI what harm it were to do it. Thou thoughtest to have his wife here\r\nand it is as if thou hadst had her, inasmuch as it is none of thy\r\nfault that the thing hath miscarried; wherefore, were I to have\r\nhimself, thou couldst not with reason blame me.'\r\n\r\nBrief, many were the lady's words and sore her complaining. However,\r\nat last, Ricciardo, bethinking himself that, an he let her go in that\r\nbelief, much ill might ensue thereof, determined to discover himself\r\nand undeceive her; wherefore, catching her in his arms and holding her\r\nfast, so she might not get away, he said, 'Sweet my soul, be not\r\nangered; that which I could not have of you by simply loving you, Love\r\nhath taught me to obtain by practice; and I am your Ricciardo.'\r\nCatella, hearing this and knowing him by the voice, would have thrown\r\nherself incontinent out of bed, but could not; whereupon she offered\r\nto cry out; but Ricciardo stopped her mouth with one hand and said,\r\n'Madam, this that hath been may henceforth on nowise be undone, though\r\nyou should cry all the days of your life; and if you cry out or cause\r\nthis ever anywise to be known of any one, two things will come\r\nthereof; the one (which should no little concern you) will be that\r\nyour honour and fair fame will be marred, for that, albeit you may\r\navouch that I brought you hither by practice, I shall say that it is\r\nnot true, nay, that I caused you come hither for monies and gifts that\r\nI promised you, whereof for that I gave you not so largely as you\r\nhoped, you waxed angry and made all this talk and this outcry; and you\r\nknow that folk are more apt to credit ill than good, wherefore I shall\r\nmore readily be believed than you. Secondly, there will ensue thereof\r\na mortal enmity between your husband and myself, and it may as well\r\nhappen that I shall kill him as he me, in which case you are never\r\nafter like to be happy or content. Wherefore, heart of my body, go not\r\nabout at once to dishonour yourself and to cast your husband and\r\nmyself into strife and peril. You are not the first woman, nor will\r\nyou be the last, who hath been deceived, nor have I in this practised\r\nupon you to bereave you of your own, but for the exceeding love that\r\nI bear you and am minded ever to bear you and to be your most humble\r\nservant. And although it is long since I and all that I possess or can\r\nor am worth have been yours and at your service, henceforward I\r\npurpose that they shall be more than ever so. Now, you are well\r\nadvised in other things and so I am certain you will be in this.'\r\n\r\nCatella, what while Ricciardo spoke thus, wept sore, but, albeit she\r\nwas sore provoked and complained grievously, nevertheless, her reason\r\nallowed so much force to his true words that she knew it to be\r\npossible that it should happen as he said; wherefore quoth she,\r\n'Ricciardo, I know not how God will vouchsafe me strength to suffer\r\nthe affront and the cheat thou hast put upon me; I will well to make\r\nno outcry here whither my simplicity and overmuch jealousy have\r\nbrought me; but of this be assured that I shall never be content till\r\none way or another I see myself avenged of this thou hast done to me.\r\nWherefore, leave me, hold me no longer; thou hast had that which thou\r\ndesiredst and hast tumbled me to thy heart's content; it is time to\r\nleave me; let me go, I prithee.'\r\n\r\nRicciardo, seeing her mind yet overmuch disordered, had laid it to\r\nheart never to leave her till he had gotten his pardon of her;\r\nwherefore, studying with the softest words to appease her, he so\r\nbespoke and so entreated and so conjured her that she was prevailed\r\nupon to make peace with him, and of like accord they abode together a\r\ngreat while thereafter in the utmost delight. Moreover, Catella,\r\nhaving thus learned how much more savoury were the lover's kisses than\r\nthose of the husband and her former rigour being changed into kind\r\nlove-liking for Ricciardo, from that day forth she loved him very\r\ntenderly and thereafter, ordering themselves with the utmost\r\ndiscretion, they many a time had joyance of their loves. God grant us\r\nto enjoy ours!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Third]\r\n\r\n     TEDALDO ELISEI, HAVING FALLEN OUT WITH HIS MISTRESS,\r\n     DEPARTETH FLORENCE AND RETURNING THITHER, AFTER AWHILE, IN A\r\n     PILGRIM'S FAVOUR, SPEAKETH WITH THE LADY AND MAKETH HER\r\n     COGNISANT OF HER ERROR; AFTER WHICH HE DELIVERETH HER\r\n     HUSBAND, WHO HAD BEEN CONVICTED OF MURDERING HIM, FROM DEATH\r\n     AND RECONCILING HIM WITH HIS BRETHREN, THENCEFORWARD\r\n     DISCREETLY ENJOYETH HIMSELF WITH HIS MISTRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nFiammetta being now silent, commended of all, the queen, to lose no\r\ntime, forthright committed the burden of discourse to Emilia, who\r\nbegan thus: \"It pleaseth me to return to our city, whence it pleased\r\nthe last two speakers to depart, and to show you how a townsman of\r\nours regained his lost mistress.\r\n\r\nThere was, then, in Florence a noble youth, whose name was Tedaldo\r\nElisei and who, being beyond measure enamoured of a lady called Madam\r\nErmellina, the wife of one Aldobrandino Palermini, deserved for his\r\npraiseworthy fashions, to enjoy his desire. However, Fortune, the\r\nenemy of the happy, denied him this solace, for that, whatever might\r\nhave been the cause, the lady, after complying awhile with Tedaldo's\r\nwishes, suddenly altogether withdrew her good graces from him and not\r\nonly refused to hearken to any message of his, but would on no wise\r\nsee him; wherefore he fell into a dire and cruel melancholy; but his\r\nlove for her had been so hidden that none guessed it to be the cause\r\nof his chagrin. After he had in divers ways studied amain to recover\r\nthe love himseemed he had lost without his fault and finding all his\r\nlabour vain, he resolved to withdraw from the world, that he might not\r\nafford her who was the cause of his ill the pleasure of seeing him\r\npine away; wherefore, without saying aught to friend or kinsman, save\r\nto a comrade of his, who knew all, he took such monies as he might\r\navail to have and departing secretly, came to Ancona, where, under the\r\nname of Filippo di Sanlodeccio, he made acquaintance with a rich\r\nmerchant and taking service with him, accompanied him to Cyprus on\r\nboard a ship of his.\r\n\r\nHis manners and behaviour so pleased the merchant that he not only\r\nassigned him a good wage, but made him in part his associate and put\r\ninto his hands a great part of his affairs, which he ordered so well\r\nand so diligently that in a few years he himself became a rich and\r\nfamous and considerable merchant; and albeit, in the midst of these\r\nhis dealings, he oft remembered him of his cruel mistress and was\r\ngrievously tormented of love and yearned sore to look on her again,\r\nsuch was his constancy that seven years long he got the better of the\r\nbattle. But, chancing one day to hear sing in Cyprus a song that\r\nhimself had made aforetime and wherein was recounted the love he bore\r\nhis mistress and she him and the pleasure he had of her, and thinking\r\nit could not be she had forgotten him, he flamed up into such a\r\npassion of desire to see her again that, unable to endure longer, he\r\nresolved to return to Florence.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, having set all his affairs in order, he betook himself\r\nwith one only servant to Ancona and transporting all his good thither,\r\ndespatched it to Florence to a friend of the Anconese his partner,\r\nwhilst he himself, in the disguise of a pilgrim returning from the\r\nHoly Sepulchre, followed secretly after with his servant and coming to\r\nFlorence, put up at a little hostelry kept by two brothers, in the\r\nneighbourhood of his mistress's house, whereto he repaired first of\r\nall, to see her, an he might. However, he found the windows and doors\r\nand all else closed, wherefore his heart misgave him she was dead or\r\nhad removed thence and he betook himself, in great concern, to the\r\nhouse of his brethren, before which he saw four of the latter clad all\r\nin black. At this he marvelled exceedingly and knowing himself so\r\nchanged both in habit and person from that which he was used to be,\r\nwhenas he departed thence, that he might not lightly be recognized, he\r\nboldly accosted a cordwainer hard by and asked him why they were clad\r\nin black; whereto he answered, 'Yonder men are clad in black for that\r\nit is not yet a fortnight since a brother of theirs, who had not been\r\nhere this great while, was murdered, and I understand they have\r\nproved to the court that one Aldobrandino Palermini, who is in prison,\r\nslew him, for that he was a well-wisher of his wife and had returned\r\nhither unknown to be with her.'\r\n\r\nTedaldo marvelled exceedingly that any one should so resemble him as\r\nto be taken for him and was grieved for Aldobrandino's ill fortune.\r\nThen, having learned that the lady was alive and well and it being now\r\nnight, he returned, full of various thoughts, to the inn and having\r\nsupped with his servant, was put to sleep well nigh at the top of the\r\nhouse. There, what with the many thoughts that stirred him and the\r\nbadness of the bed and peradventure also by reason of the supper,\r\nwhich had been meagre, half the night passed whilst he had not yet\r\nbeen able to fall asleep; wherefore, being awake, himseemed about\r\nmidnight he heard folk come down into the house from the roof, and\r\nafter through the chinks of the chamber-door he saw a light come up\r\nthither. Thereupon he stole softly to the door and putting his eye to\r\nthe chink, fell a-spying what this might mean and saw a comely enough\r\nlass who held the light, whilst three men, who had come down from the\r\nroof, made towards her; and after some greetings had passed between\r\nthem, one of them said to the girl, 'Henceforth, praised be God, we\r\nmay abide secure, since we know now for certain that the death of\r\nTedaldo Elisei hath been proved by his brethren against Aldobrandino\r\nPalermini, who hath confessed thereto, and judgment is now recorded;\r\nnevertheless, it behoveth to keep strict silence, for that, should it\r\never become known that it was we [who slew him], we shall be in the\r\nsame danger as is Aldobrandino.' Having thus bespoken the woman, who\r\nshowed herself much rejoiced thereat, they left her and going below,\r\nbetook themselves to bed.\r\n\r\nTedaldo, hearing this, fell a-considering how many and how great are\r\nthe errors which may befall the minds of men, bethinking him first of\r\nhis brothers who had bewept and buried a stranger in his stead and\r\nafter of the innocent man accused on false suspicion and brought by\r\nuntrue witness to the point of death, no less than of the blind\r\nseverity of laws and rulers, who ofttimes, under cover of diligent\r\ninvestigation of the truth, cause, by their cruelties, prove that\r\nwhich is false and style themselves ministers of justice and of God,\r\nwhereas indeed they are executors of iniquity and of the devil; after\r\nwhich he turned his thought to the deliverance of Aldobrandino and\r\ndetermined in himself what he should do. Accordingly, arising in the\r\nmorning, he left his servant at the inn and betook himself alone,\r\nwhenas it seemed to him time, to the house of his mistress, where,\r\nchancing to find the door open, he entered in and saw the lady seated,\r\nall full of tears and bitterness of soul, in a little ground floor\r\nroom that was there.\r\n\r\nAt this sight he was like to weep for compassion of her and drawing\r\nnear to her, said, 'Madam, afflict not yourself; your peace is at\r\nhand.' The lady, hearing this, lifted her eyes and said, weeping,\r\n'Good man, thou seemest to me a stranger pilgrim; what knowest thou of\r\nmy peace or of my affliction?' 'Madam,' answered Tedaldo, 'I am of\r\nConstantinople and am but now come hither, being sent of God to turn\r\nyour tears into laughter and to deliver your husband from death.'\r\nQuoth she, 'An thou be of Constantinople and newly come hither, how\r\nknowest thou who I am or who is my husband?' Thereupon, the pilgrim\r\nbeginning from the beginning, recounted to her the whole history of\r\nAldobrandino's troubles and told her who she was and how long she had\r\nbeen married and other things which he very well knew of her affairs;\r\nwhereat she marvelled exceedingly and holding him for a prophet, fell\r\non her knees at his feet, beseeching him for God's sake, an he were\r\ncome for Aldobrandino's salvation, to despatch, for that the time was\r\nshort.\r\n\r\nThe pilgrim, feigning himself a very holy man, said, 'Madam, arise and\r\nweep not, but hearken well to that which I shall say to you and take\r\ngood care never to tell it to any. According to that which God hath\r\nrevealed unto me, the tribulation wherein you now are hath betided you\r\nbecause of a sin committed by you aforetime, which God the Lord hath\r\nchosen in part to purge with this present annoy and will have\r\naltogether amended of you; else will you fall into far greater\r\naffliction.' 'Sir,' answered the lady, 'I have many sins and know not\r\nwhich one, more than another, God the Lord would have me amend;\r\nwherefore, an you know it, tell me and I will do what I may to amend\r\nit.' 'Madam,' rejoined the pilgrim, 'I know well enough what it is,\r\nnor do I question you thereof the better to know it, but to the intent\r\nthat, telling it yourself, you may have the more remorse thereof. But\r\nlet us come to the fact; tell me, do you remember, ever to have had a\r\nlover?'\r\n\r\nThe lady, hearing this, heaved a deep sigh and marvelled sore,\r\nsupposing none had ever known it, albeit, in the days when he was\r\nslain who had been buried for Tedaldo, there had been some whispering\r\nthereof, for certain words not very discreetly used by Tedaldo's\r\nconfidant, who knew it; then answered, 'I see that God discovereth\r\nunto you all men's secrets, wherefore I am resolved not to hide mine\r\nown from you. True it is that in my youth I loved over all the\r\nill-fortuned youth whose death is laid to my husband's charge, which\r\ndeath I have bewept as sore as it was grievous to me, for that, albeit\r\nI showed myself harsh and cruel to him before his departure, yet\r\nneither his long absence nor his unhappy death hath availed to tear\r\nhim from my heart.' Quoth the pilgrim, 'The hapless youth who is dead\r\nyou never loved, but Tedaldo Elisei ay.[176] But tell me, what was the\r\noccasion of your falling out with him? Did he ever give you any\r\noffence?' 'Certes, no,' replied she; 'he never offended against me;\r\nthe cause of the breach was the prate of an accursed friar, to whom I\r\nonce confessed me and who, when I told him of the love I bore Tedaldo\r\nand the privacy I had with him, made such a racket about my ears that\r\nI tremble yet to think of it, telling me that, an I desisted not\r\ntherefrom, I should go in the devil's mouth to the deepest deep of\r\nhell and there be cast into everlasting fire; whereupon there entered\r\ninto me such a fear that I altogether determined to forswear all\r\nfurther converse with him, and that I might have no occasion\r\ntherefor, I would no longer receive his letters or messages; albeit I\r\nbelieve, had he persevered awhile, instead of getting him gone (as I\r\npresume) in despair, that, seeing him, as I did, waste away like snow\r\nin the sun, my harsh resolve would have yielded, for that I had no\r\ngreater desire in the world.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 176: _i.e._ It was not the dead man, but Tedaldo Elisei whom\r\nyou loved. (_Lo sventurato giovane che fu morto non amasti voi mai, ma\r\nTedaldo Elisei si._)]\r\n\r\n'Madam,' rejoined the pilgrim, 'it is this sin alone that now\r\nafflicteth you. I know for certain that Tedaldo did you no manner of\r\nviolence; whenas you fell in love with him, you did it of your own\r\nfree will, for that he pleased you; and as you yourself would have it,\r\nhe came to you and enjoyed your privacy, wherein both with words and\r\ndeeds you showed him such complaisance that, if he loved you before,\r\nyou caused his love redouble a thousandfold. And this being so (as I\r\nknow it was) what cause should have availed to move you so harshly to\r\nwithdraw yourself from him? These things should be pondered awhile\r\nbeforehand and if you think you may presently have cause to repent\r\nthereof, as of ill doing, you ought not to do them. You might, at your\r\npleasure, have ordained of him, as of that which belonged to you, that\r\nhe should no longer be yours; but to go about to deprive him of\r\nyourself, you who were his, was a theft and an unseemly thing, whenas\r\nit was not his will. Now you must know that I am a friar and am\r\ntherefore well acquainted with all their usances; and if I speak\r\nsomewhat at large of them for your profit, it is not forbidden me, as\r\nit were to another; nay, and it pleaseth me to speak of them, so you\r\nmay henceforward know them better than you appear to have done in the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nFriars of old were very pious and worthy men, but those who nowadays\r\nstyle themselves friars and would be held such have nothing of the\r\nmonk but the gown; nor is this latter even that of a true friar, for\r\nthat,--whereas of the founders of the monastic orders they[177] were\r\nordained strait and poor and of coarse stuff and demonstrative[178] of\r\nthe spirit of the wearers, who testified that they held things\r\ntemporal in contempt whenas they wrapped their bodies in so mean a\r\nhabit,--those of our time have them made full and double and glossy\r\nand of the finest cloth and have brought them to a quaint pontifical\r\ncut, insomuch that they think it no shame to flaunt it withal\r\npeacock-wise, in the churches and public places, even as do the laity\r\nwith their apparel; and like as with the sweep-net the fisher goeth\r\nabout to take many fishes in the river at one cast, even so these,\r\nwrapping themselves about with the amplest of skirts, study to\r\nentangle therein great store of prudish maids and widows and many\r\nother silly women and men, and this is their chief concern over any\r\nother exercise; wherefore, to speak more plainly, they have not the\r\nfriar's gown, but only the colours thereof.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: _i.e._ friars' gowns. Boccaccio constantly uses this\r\nirregular form of enallage, especially in dialogue.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 178: Or, as we should nowadays say, \"typical.\"]\r\n\r\nMoreover, whereas the ancients[179] desired the salvation of mankind,\r\nthose of our day covet women and riches and turn their every thought\r\nto terrifying the minds of the foolish with clamours and\r\ndepicturements[180] and to making believe that sins may be purged with\r\nalmsdeeds and masses, to the intent that unto themselves (who, of\r\npoltroonery, not of devoutness, and that they may not suffer\r\nfatigue,[181] have, as a last resort, turned friars) one may bring\r\nbread, another send wine and a third give them a dole of money for the\r\nsouls of their departed friends. Certes, it is true that almsdeeds and\r\nprayers purge away sins; but, if those who give alms knew on what\r\nmanner folks they bestow them, they would or keep them for themselves\r\nor cast them before as many hogs. And for that these[182] know that,\r\nthe fewer the possessors of a great treasure, the more they live at\r\nease, every one of them studieth with clamours and bugbears to detach\r\nothers from that whereof he would fain abide sole possessor. They\r\ndecry lust in men, in order that, they who are chidden desisting from\r\nwomen, the latter may be left to the chiders; they condemn usury and\r\nunjust gains, to the intent that, it being entrusted to them to make\r\nrestitution thereof, they may, with that which they declare must bring\r\nto perdition him who hath it, make wide their gowns and purchase\r\nbishopricks and other great benefices.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 179: _i.e._ the founders of the monastic orders.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 180: Lit. pictures, paintings (_dipinture_), but evidently\r\nhere used in a tropical sense, Boccaccio's apparent meaning being that\r\nthe hypocritical friars used to terrify their devotees by picturing to\r\nthem, in vivid colours, the horrors of the punishment reserved for\r\nsinners.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 181: _i.e._ may not have to labour for their living.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: _i.e._ the false friars.]\r\n\r\nAnd when they are taken to task of these and many other unseemly\r\nthings that they do, they think that to answer, \"Do as we say and not\r\nas we do,\" is a sufficient discharge of every grave burden, as if it\r\nwere possible for the sheep to be more constant and stouter to resist\r\ntemptation[183] than the shepherds. And how many there be of those to\r\nwhom they make such a reply who apprehend it not after the\r\nfashion[184] in which they say it, the most part of them know. The\r\nmonks of our day would have you do as they say, to wit, fill their\r\npurses with money, trust your secrets to them, observe chastity,\r\npractise patience and forgiveness of injuries and keep yourselves from\r\nevil speaking,--all things good, seemly and righteous; but why would\r\nthey have this? So they may do that, which if the laity did,\r\nthemselves could not do. Who knoweth not that without money idleness\r\nmay not endure? An thou expend thy monies in thy pleasures, the friar\r\nwill not be able to idle it in the monastery; an thou follow after\r\nwomen, there will be no room for him, and except thou be patient or a\r\nforgiver of injuries, he will not dare to come to thy house to corrupt\r\nthy family. But why should I hark back after every particular? They\r\ncondemn themselves in the eyes of the understanding as often as they\r\nmake this excuse. An they believe not themselves able to abstain and\r\nlead a devout life, why do they not rather abide at home? Or, if they\r\nwill e'en give themselves unto this,[185] why do they not ensue that\r\nother holy saying of the Gospel, \"Christ began to do and to\r\nteach?\"[186] Let them first do and after teach others. I have in my\r\ntime seen a thousand of them wooers, lovers and haunters, not of lay\r\nwomen alone, but of nuns; ay, and of those that make the greatest\r\noutcry in the pulpit. Shall we, then, follow after these who are thus\r\nfashioned? Whoso doth it doth that which he will, but God knoweth if\r\nhe do wisely.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 183: Lit. more of iron (_più di ferro_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 184: Sic (_per lo modo_); but _quære_ not rather \"in the\r\nsense.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 185: _i.e._ if they must enter upon this way of life, to\r\nwit, that of the friar.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 186: The reference is apparently to the opening verse of the\r\nActs of the Apostles, where Luke says, \"The former treatise have I\r\nmade, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began to do and to teach.\" It\r\nneed hardly be remarked that the passage in question does not bear the\r\ninterpretation Boccaccio would put upon it.]\r\n\r\nBut, granted even we are to allow that which the friar who chid you\r\nsaid to you, to wit, that it is a grievous sin to break the marriage\r\nvow, is it not a far greater sin to rob a man and a greater yet to\r\nslay him or drive him into exile, to wander miserably about the world?\r\nEvery one must allow this. For a woman to have converse with a man is\r\na sin of nature; but to rob him or slay him or drive him into exile\r\nproceedeth from malignity of mind. That you robbed Tedaldo I have\r\nalready shown you, in despoiling him of yourself, who had become his\r\nof your spontaneous will, and I say also that, so far as in you lay,\r\nyou slew him, for that it was none of your fault,--showing yourself,\r\nas you did, hourly more cruel,--that he slew not himself with his own\r\nhand; and the law willeth that whoso is the cause of the ill that is\r\ndone be held alike guilty with him who doth it. And that you were the\r\ncause of his exile and of his going wandering seven years about the\r\nworld cannot be denied. So that in whichever one of these three things\r\naforesaid you have committed a far greater sin than in your converse\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nBut, let us see; maybe Tedaldo deserved this usage? Certes, he did\r\nnot; you yourself have already confessed it, more by token that I know\r\nhe loveth[187] you more than himself. No woman was ever so honoured,\r\nso exalted, so magnified over every other of her sex as were you by\r\nhim, whenas he found himself where he might fairly speak of you,\r\nwithout engendering suspicion. His every good, his every honour, his\r\nevery liberty were all committed by him into your hands. Was he not\r\nnoble and young? Was he not handsome among all his townsmen? Was he\r\nnot accomplished in such things as pertain unto young men? Was he not\r\nloved, cherished and well seen of every one? You will not say nay to\r\nthis either. Then how, at the bidding of a scurvy, envious numskull of\r\na friar, could you take such a cruel resolve against him? I know not\r\nwhat error is that of women who eschew men and hold them in little\r\nesteem, whenas, considering what themselves are and what and how great\r\nis the nobility, beyond every other animal, given of God to man, they\r\nshould rather glory whenas they are loved of any and prize him over\r\nall and study with all diligence to please him, so he may never desist\r\nfrom loving them. This how you did, moved by the prate of a friar,\r\nwho must for certain have been some broth-swilling pasty-gorger, you\r\nyourself know; and most like he had a mind to put himself in the place\r\nwhence he studied to expel others.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 187: _Sic_; but the past tense \"loved\" is probably intended,\r\nas the pretended pilgrim had not yet discovered Tedaldo to be alive.]\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the sin that Divine justice, the which with a just\r\nbalance bringeth all its operations to effect, hath willed not to\r\nleave unpunished; and even as you without reason studied to withdraw\r\nyourself from Tedaldo, so on like wise hath your husband been and is\r\nyet, without reason, in peril for Tedaldo, and you in tribulation.\r\nWherefrom an you would be delivered, that which it behoveth you to\r\npromise, and yet more to do, is this; that, should it ever chance that\r\nTedaldo return hither from his long banishment, you will render him\r\nagain your favour, your love, your goodwill and your privacy and\r\nreinstate him in that condition wherein he was, ere you foolishly\r\nhearkened to yonder crack-brained friar.'\r\n\r\nThe pilgrim having thus made an end of his discourse, the lady, who\r\nhad hearkened thereto with the utmost attention, for that his\r\narguments appeared to her most true and that, hearing him say, she\r\naccounted herself of a certainty afflicted for the sin of which he\r\nspoke, said, 'Friend of God, I know full well that the things you\r\nallege are true, and in great part by your showing do I perceive what\r\nmanner of folk are these friars, whom till now I have held all saints.\r\nMoreover, I acknowledge my default without doubt to have been great in\r\nthat which I wrought against Tedaldo; and an I might, I would gladly\r\namend it on such wise as you have said; but how may this be done?\r\nTedaldo can never more return hither; he is dead; wherefore I know not\r\nwhy it should behove me promise that which may not be performed.'\r\n'Madam,' replied the pilgrim, 'according to that which God hath\r\nrevealed unto me, Tedaldo is nowise dead, but alive and well and in\r\ngood case, so but he had your favour.' Quoth the lady, 'Look what you\r\nsay; I saw him dead before my door of several knife-thrusts and had\r\nhim in these arms and bathed his dead face with many tears, the which\r\nit may be gave occasion for that which hath been spoken thereof\r\nunseemly.' 'Madam,' replied the pilgrim, 'whatever you may say, I\r\ncertify you that Tedaldo is alive, and if you will e'en promise me\r\nthat [which I ask,] with intent to fulfil your promise, I hope you\r\nshall soon see him.' Quoth she, 'That do I promise and will gladly\r\nperform; nor could aught betide that would afford me such content as\r\nto see my husband free and unharmed and Tedaldo alive.'\r\n\r\nThereupon it seemed to Tedaldo time to discover himself and to comfort\r\nthe lady with more certain hope of her husband, and accordingly he\r\nsaid, 'Madam, in order that I may comfort you for your husband, it\r\nbehoveth me reveal to you a secret, which look you discover not unto\r\nany, as you value your life.' Now they were in a very retired place\r\nand alone, the lady having conceived the utmost confidence of the\r\nsanctity which herseemed was in the pilgrim; wherefore Tedaldo,\r\npulling out a ring, which she had given him the last night he had been\r\nwith her and which he had kept with the utmost diligence, and showing\r\nit to her, said, 'Madam, know you this?' As soon as she saw it, she\r\nrecognized it and answered, 'Ay, sir; I gave it to Tedaldo aforetime.'\r\nWhereupon the pilgrim, rising to his feet, hastily cast off his\r\npalmer's gown and hat and speaking Florence-fashion, said, 'And know\r\nyou me?'\r\n\r\nWhen the lady saw this, she knew him to be Tedaldo and was all aghast,\r\nfearing him as one feareth the dead, an they be seen after death to go\r\nas if alive; wherefore she made not towards him to welcome him as\r\nTedaldo returned from Cyprus, but would have fled from him in\r\naffright, as he were Tedaldo come back from the tomb. Whereupon,\r\n'Madam,' quoth he, 'fear not; I am your Tedaldo, alive and well, and\r\nhave never died nor been slain, whatsoever you and my brothers may\r\nbelieve.' The lady, somewhat reassured and knowing his voice,\r\nconsidered him awhile longer and avouched in herself that he was\r\ncertainly Tedaldo; wherefore she threw herself, weeping, on his neck\r\nand kissed him, saying, 'Welcome back, sweet my Tedaldo.'\r\n\r\nTedaldo, having kissed and embraced her, said, 'Madam, it is no time\r\nnow for closer greetings; I must e'en go take order that Aldobrandino\r\nmay be restored to you safe and sound; whereof I hope that, ere\r\nto-morrow come eventide, you shall hear news that will please you;\r\nnay, if, as I expect, I have good news of his safety, I trust this\r\nnight to be able to come to you and report them to you at more leisure\r\nthan I can at this present.' Then, donning his gown and hat again, he\r\nkissed the lady once more and bidding her be of good hope, took leave\r\nof her and repaired whereas Aldobrandino lay in prison, occupied more\r\nwith fear of imminent death than with hopes of deliverance to come.\r\nTedaldo, with the gaoler's consent, went in to him, in the guise of a\r\nghostly comforter, and seating himself by his side, said to him,\r\n'Aldobrandino, I am a friend of thine, sent thee for thy deliverance\r\nby God, who hath taken pity on thee because of thine innocence;\r\nwherefore, if, in reverence to Him, thou wilt grant me a little boon\r\nthat I shall ask of thee, thou shalt without fail, ere to-morrow be\r\nnight, whereas thou lookest for sentence of death, hear that of thine\r\nacquittance.'\r\n\r\n'Honest man,' replied the prisoner, 'since thou art solicitous of my\r\ndeliverance, albeit I know thee not nor mind me ever to have seen\r\nthee, needs must thou be a friend, as thou sayst. In truth, the sin,\r\nfor which they say I am to be doomed to death, I never committed;\r\nthough others enough have I committed aforetime, which, it may be,\r\nhave brought me to this pass. But this I say to thee, of reverence to\r\nGod; an He presently have compassion on me, I will not only promise,\r\nbut gladly do any thing, however great, to say nothing of a little\r\none; wherefore ask that which pleaseth thee, for without fail, if it\r\ncome to pass that I escape with life, I will punctually perform it.'\r\nThen said the pilgrim, 'What I would have of thee is that thou pardon\r\nTedaldo's four brothers the having brought thee to this pass,\r\nbelieving thee guilty of their brother's death, and have them again\r\nfor brethren and for friends, whenas they crave thee pardon thereof.'\r\nWhereto quoth Aldobrandino, 'None knoweth but he who hath suffered the\r\naffront how sweet a thing is vengeance and with what ardour it is\r\ndesired; nevertheless, so God may apply Himself to my deliverance, I\r\nwill freely pardon them; nay, I pardon them now, and if I come off\r\nhence alive and escape, I will in this hold such course as shall be\r\nto thy liking.'\r\n\r\nThis pleased the pilgrim and without concerning himself to say more to\r\nhim, he exhorted him to be of good heart, for that, ere the ensuing\r\nday came to an end, he should without fail hear very certain news of\r\nhis safety. Then, taking leave of him, he repaired to the Seignory and\r\nsaid privily to a gentleman who was in session there, 'My lord, every\r\none should gladly labour to bring to light the truth of things, and\r\nespecially those who hold such a room as this of yours, to the end\r\nthat those may not suffer the penalty who have not committed the crime\r\nand that the guilty may be punished; that which may be brought about,\r\nto your honour and the bane of those who have merited it, I am come\r\nhither to you. As you know, you have rigorously proceeded against\r\nAldobrandino Palermini and thinking you have found for truth that it\r\nwas he who slew Tedaldo Elisei, are minded to condemn him; but this is\r\nmost certainly false, as I doubt not to show you, ere midnight betide,\r\nby giving into your hands the murderers of the young man in question.'\r\n\r\nThe worthy gentleman, who was in concern for Aldobrandino, willingly\r\ngave ear to the pilgrim's words and having conferred at large with him\r\nupon the matter, on his information, took the two innkeeper brothers\r\nand their servant, without resistance, in their first sleep. He would\r\nhave put them to the question, to discover how the case stood; but\r\nthey brooked it not and each first for himself, and after all\r\ntogether, openly confessed that it was they who had slain Tedaldo\r\nElisei, knowing him not. Being questioned of the case, they said [that\r\nit was] for that he had given the wife of one of them sore annoy, what\r\nwhile they were abroad, and would fain have enforced her to do his\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nThe pilgrim, having heard this, with the magistrate's consent took his\r\nleave and repairing privily to the house of Madam Ermellina, found her\r\nalone and awaiting him, (all else in the house being gone to sleep,)\r\nalike desirous of having good news of her husband and of fully\r\nreconciling herself with her Tedaldo. He accosted her with a joyful\r\ncountenance and said, 'Dearest lady mine, be of good cheer, for\r\nto-morrow thou shalt certainly have thine Aldobrandino here again safe\r\nand sound'; and to give her more entire assurance thereof, he fully\r\nrecounted to her that which he had done. Whereupon she, glad as ever\r\nwoman was of two so sudden and so happy chances, to wit, the having\r\nher lover alive again, whom she verily believed to have bewept dead,\r\nand the seeing Aldobrandino free from peril, whose death she looked\r\nere many days to have to mourn, affectionately embraced and kissed\r\nTedaldo; then, getting them to bed together, with one accord they made\r\na glad and gracious peace, taking delight and joyance one of the\r\nother. Whenas the day drew near, Tedaldo arose, after showing the lady\r\nthat which he purposed to do and praying her anew to keep it a close\r\nsecret, and went forth, even in his pilgrim's habit, to attend, whenas\r\nit should be time, to Aldobrandino's affairs. The day come, it\r\nappearing to the Seignory that they had full information of the\r\nmatter, they straightway discharged Aldobrandino and a few days after\r\nlet strike off the murderers' heads whereas they had committed the\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nAldobrandino being now, to the great joy of himself and his wife and\r\nof all his friends and kinsfolk, free and manifestly acknowledging\r\nthat he owed his deliverance to the good offices of the pilgrim,\r\ncarried the latter to his house for such time as it pleased him to\r\nsojourn in the city; and there they could not sate themselves of doing\r\nhim honour and worship, especially the lady, who knew with whom she\r\nhad to do. After awhile, deeming it time to bring his brothers to an\r\naccord with Aldobrandino and knowing that they were not only put to\r\nshame by the latter's acquittance, but went armed for fear [of his\r\nresentment,] he demanded of his host the fulfilment of his promise.\r\nAldobrandino freely answered that he was ready, whereupon the pilgrim\r\ncaused him prepare against the morrow a goodly banquet, whereat he\r\ntold him he would have him and his kinsmen and kinswomen entertain the\r\nfour brothers and their ladies, adding that he himself would go\r\nincontinent and bid the latter on his part to peace and his banquet.\r\nAldobrandino consenting to all that liked the pilgrim, the latter\r\nforthright betook himself to the four brothers and plying them with\r\nstore of such words as behoved unto the matter, in fine, with\r\nirrepugnable arguments, brought them easily enough to consent to\r\nregain Aldobrandino's friendship by asking pardon; which done, he\r\ninvited them and their ladies to dinner with Aldobrandino next\r\nmorning, and they, being certified of his good faith, frankly accepted\r\nthe invitation.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the morrow, towards dinner-time, Tedaldo's four\r\nbrothers, clad all in black as they were, came, with sundry of their\r\nfriends, to the house of Aldobrandino, who stayed for them, and there,\r\nin the presence of all who had been bidden of him to bear them\r\ncompany, cast down their arms and committed themselves to his mercy,\r\ncraving forgiveness of that which they had wrought against him.\r\nAldobrandino, weeping, received them affectionately, and kissing them\r\nall on the mouth, despatched the matter in a few words, remitting unto\r\nthem every injury received. After them came their wives and sisters,\r\nclad all in sad-coloured raiment, and were graciously received by\r\nMadam Ermellina and the other ladies. Then were all, ladies and men\r\nalike, magnificently entertained at the banquet, nor was there aught\r\nin the entertainment other than commendable, except it were the\r\ntaciturnity occasioned by the yet fresh sorrow expressed in the sombre\r\nraiment of Tedaldo's kinsfolk. Now on this account the pilgrim's\r\ndevice of the banquet had been blamed of some and he had observed it;\r\nwherefore, the time being come to do away with the constraint\r\naforesaid, he rose to his feet, according as he had foreordained in\r\nhimself, what while the rest still ate of the fruits, and said,\r\n'Nothing hath lacked to this entertainment that should make it joyful,\r\nsave only Tedaldo himself; whom (since having had him continually with\r\nyou, you have not known him) I will e'en discover to you.'\r\n\r\nSo saying, he cast off his palmer's gown and all other his pilgrim's\r\nweeds and abiding in a jerkin of green sendal, was with no little\r\namazement, long eyed and considered of all, ere any would venture to\r\nbelieve it was indeed he. Tedaldo, seeing this, recounted many\r\nparticulars of the relations and things betided between them, as well\r\nas of his own adventures; whereupon his brethren and the other\r\ngentlemen present ran all to embrace him, with eyes full of joyful\r\ntears, as after did the ladies on like wise, as well strangers as\r\nkinswomen, except only Madam Ermellina. Which Aldobrandino seeing,\r\n'What is this, Ermellina?' quoth he. 'Why dost thou not welcome\r\nTedaldo, as do the other ladies?' Whereto she answered, in the hearing\r\nof all, 'There is none who had more gladly welcomed and would yet\r\nwelcome him than myself, who am more beholden to him than any other\r\nwoman, seeing that by his means I have gotten thee again; but the\r\nunseemly words spoken in the days when we mourned him whom we deemed\r\nTedaldo made me refrain therefrom.' Quoth her husband, 'Go to;\r\nthinkest thou I believe in the howlers?[188] He hath right well shown\r\ntheir prate to be false by procuring my deliverance; more by token\r\nthat I never believed it. Quick, rise and go and embrace him.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 188: Lit. barkers (_abbajatori_), _i.e._ slanderers.]\r\n\r\nThe lady, who desired nothing better, was not slow to obey her husband\r\nin this and accordingly, arising, embraced Tedaldo, as the other\r\nladies had done, and gave him joyous welcome. This liberality of\r\nAldobrandino was mighty pleasing to Tedaldo's brothers and to every\r\nman and woman there, and thereby all suspect[189] that had been\r\naroused in the minds of some by the words aforesaid was done away.\r\nThen, every one having given Tedaldo joy, he with his own hands rent\r\nthe black clothes on his brothers' backs and the sad-coloured on those\r\nof his sisters and kinswomen and would have them send after other\r\napparel, which whenas they had donned, they gave themselves to singing\r\nand dancing and other diversions galore; wherefore the banquet, which\r\nhad had a silent beginning had a loud-resounding ending. Thereafter,\r\nwith the utmost mirth, they one and all repaired, even as they were,\r\nto Tedaldo's house, where they supped that night, and on this wise\r\nthey continued to feast several days longer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 189: Lit. despite, rancour (_rugginuzza_), but the phrase\r\nappears to refer to the suspicions excited by the whispers that had\r\nbeen current, as above mentioned, of the connection between Ermellina\r\nand Tedaldo.]\r\n\r\nThe Florentines awhile regarded Tedaldo with amazement, as a man risen\r\nfrom the dead; nay, in many an one's mind, and even in that of his\r\nbrethren, there abode a certain faint doubt an he were indeed himself\r\nand they did not yet thoroughly believe it, nor belike had they\r\nbelieved it for a long time to come but for a chance which made them\r\nclear who the murdered man was which was on this wise. There passed\r\none day before their house certain footmen[190] of Lunigiana, who,\r\nseeing Tedaldo, made towards him and said, 'Give you good day,\r\nFaziuolo.' Whereto Tedaldo in his brothers' presence answered, 'You\r\nmistake me.' The others, hearing him speak, were abashed and cried him\r\npardon, saying, 'Forsooth you resemble, more than ever we saw one man\r\nfavour another, a comrade of ours called Faziuolo of Pontremoli, who\r\ncame hither some fortnight or more agone, nor could we ever since\r\nlearn what is come of him. Indeed, we marvelled at the dress, for that\r\nhe was a soldier, even as we are.' Tedaldo's elder brother, hearing\r\nthis, came forward and enquired how this Faziuolo had been clad. They\r\ntold him and it was found to have been punctually as they said;\r\nwherefore, what with these and what with other tokens, it was known\r\nfor certain that he who had been slain was Faziuolo and not Tedaldo,\r\nand all doubt of the latter[191] accordingly departed [the minds of]\r\nhis brothers and of every other. Tedaldo, then, being returned very\r\nrich, persevered in his love and the lady falling out with him no\r\nmore, they long, discreetly dealing, had enjoyment of their love.

See\r\npost.]\r\n\r\nThere was, then, and yet is, in Tuscany, an abbey situate, like as we\r\nsee many thereof, in a place not overmuch frequented of men, whereof a\r\nmonk was made abbot, who was a very holy man in everything, save in\r\nthe matter of women, and in this he contrived to do so warily that\r\nwell nigh none, not to say knew, but even suspected him thereof, for\r\nthat he was holden exceeding godly and just in everything. It chanced\r\nthat a very wealthy farmer, by name Ferondo, contracted a great\r\nintimacy with him, a heavy, clodpate fellow and dull-witted beyond\r\nmeasure, whose commerce pleased the abbot but for that his simplicity\r\nwhiles afforded him some diversion, and in the course of their\r\nacquaintance, the latter perceived that Ferondo had a very handsome\r\nwoman to wife, of whom he became so passionately enamoured that he\r\nthought of nothing else day or night; but, hearing that, simple and\r\nshallow-witted as Ferondo was in everything else, he was shrewd enough\r\nin the matter of loving and guarding his wife, he well nigh despaired\r\nof her.\r\n\r\nHowever, like a very adroit man as he was, he wrought on such wise\r\nwith Ferondo that he came whiles, with his wife, to take his pleasance\r\nin the abbey-garden, and there he very demurely entertained them with\r\ndiscourse of the beatitude of the life eternal and of the pious works\r\nof many men and women of times past, insomuch that the lady was taken\r\nwith a desire to confess herself to him and asked and had Ferondo's\r\nleave thereof. Accordingly, to the abbot's exceeding pleasure, she\r\ncame to confess to him and seating herself at his feet, before she\r\nproceeded to say otherwhat, began thus: 'Sir, if God had given me a\r\nright husband or had given me none, it would belike be easy to me,\r\nwith the help of your exhortations, to enter upon the road which you\r\nsay leadeth folk unto life eternal; but I, having regard to what\r\nFerondo is and to his witlessness, may style myself a widow, and yet I\r\nam married, inasmuch as, he living, I can have no other husband; and\r\ndolt as he is, he is without any cause, so out of all measure jealous\r\nof me that by reason thereof I cannot live with him otherwise than in\r\ntribulation and misery; wherefore, ere I come to other confession, I\r\nhumbly beseech you, as most I may, that it may please you give me some\r\ncounsel concerning this, for that, an the occasion of my well-doing\r\nbegin not therefrom, confession or other good work will profit me\r\nlittle.'\r\n\r\nThis speech gave the abbot great satisfaction and himseemed fortune\r\nhad opened him the way to his chief desire; wherefore, 'Daughter,'\r\nquoth he, 'I can well believe that it must be a sore annoy for a fair\r\nand dainty dame such as you are to have a blockhead to husband, but a\r\nmuch greater meseemeth to have a jealous man; wherefore, you having\r\nboth the one and the other, I can lightly credit that which you avouch\r\nof your tribulation. But for this, speaking briefly, I see neither\r\ncounsel nor remedy save one, the which is that Ferondo be cured of\r\nthis jealousy. The medicine that will cure him I know very well how to\r\nmake, provided you have the heart to keep secret that which I shall\r\ntell you.' 'Father mine,' answered the lady, 'have no fear of that,\r\nfor I would liefer suffer death than tell any that which you bid me\r\nnot repeat; but how may this be done?' Quoth the abbot, 'An we would\r\nhave him cured, it behoveth of necessity that he go to purgatory.'\r\n'But how,' asked she, 'can he go thither alive?' 'Needs must he die,'\r\nreplied the abbot, 'and so go thither; and whenas he shall have\r\nsuffered such penance as shall suffice to purge him of his jealousy,\r\nwe will pray God, with certain orisons that he restore him to this\r\nlife, and He will do it.' 'Then,' said the lady, 'I am to become a\r\nwidow?' 'Ay,' answered the abbot, 'for a certain time, wherein you\r\nmust look well you suffer not yourself to be married again, for that\r\nGod would take it in ill part, and whenas Ferondo returned hither, it\r\nwould behove you return to him and he would then be more jealous than\r\never.' Quoth she, 'Provided he be but cured of this calamity, so it\r\nmay not behove me abide in prison all my life, I am content; do as it\r\npleaseth you.' 'And I will do it,'[193] rejoined he; 'but what guerdon\r\nam I to have of you for such a service?' 'Father,' answered the lady,\r\n'you shall have whatsoever pleaseth you, so but it be in my power; but\r\nwhat can the like of me that may befit such a man as yourself?'\r\n'Madam,' replied the abbot 'you can do no less for me than that which\r\nI undertake to do for you; for that, like as I am disposed to do that\r\nwhich is to be your weal and your solacement, even so can you do that\r\nwhich will be the saving and assainment of my life.' Quoth she, 'An it\r\nbe so, I am ready.' 'Then,' said the abbot, 'you must give me your\r\nlove and vouchsafe me satisfaction of yourself, for whom I am all\r\nafire with love and languishment.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 193: _i.e._ I will cure your husband of his jealousy.]\r\n\r\nThe lady, hearing this, was all aghast and answered, 'Alack, father\r\nmine, what is this you ask? Methought you were a saint. Doth it beseem\r\nholy men to require women, who come to them for counsel, of such\r\nthings?' 'Fair my soul,' rejoined the abbot, 'marvel not, for that\r\nsanctity nowise abateth by this, seeing it hath its seat in the soul\r\nand that which I ask of you is a sin of the body. But, be that as it\r\nmay, your ravishing beauty hath had such might that love constraineth\r\nme to do thus; and I tell you that you may glory in your charms over\r\nall other women, considering that they please holy men, who are used\r\nto look upon the beauties of heaven. Moreover, abbot though I be, I am\r\na man like another and am, as you see, not yet old. Nor should this\r\nthat I ask be grievous to you to do; nay, you should rather desire it,\r\nfor that, what while Ferondo sojourneth in purgatory, I will bear you\r\ncompany by night and render you that solacement which he should give\r\nyou; nor shall any ever come to know of this, for that every one\r\nbelieveth of me that, and more than that, which you but now believed\r\nof me. Reject not the grace that God sendeth you, for there be women\r\nenough who covet that which you may have and shall have, if, like a\r\nwise woman, you hearken to my counsel. Moreover, I have fair and\r\nprecious jewels, which I purpose shall belong to none other than\r\nyourself. Do, then, for me, sweet my hope, that which I willingly do\r\nfor you.'\r\n\r\nThe lady hung her head, knowing not how to deny him, whilst herseemed\r\nit were ill done to grant him what he asked; but the abbot, seeing\r\nthat she hearkened and hesitated to reply and himseeming he had\r\nalready half converted her, followed up his first words with many\r\nothers and stayed not till he had persuaded her that she would do well\r\nto comply with him. Accordingly, she said, blushing, that she was\r\nready to do his every commandment, but might not avail thereto till\r\nsuch time as Ferondo should be gone to purgatory; whereupon quoth the\r\nabbot, exceeding well pleased, 'And we will make shift to send him\r\nthither incontinent; do you but contrive that he come hither to-morrow\r\nor next day to sojourn with me.' So saying, he privily put a very\r\nhandsome ring into her hand and dismissed her. The lady rejoiced at\r\nthe gift and looking to have others, rejoined her companions, to whom\r\nshe fell to relating marvellous things of the abbot's sanctity, and\r\npresently returned home with them.\r\n\r\nA few days after Ferondo repaired to the abbey, whom, whenas the abbot\r\nsaw, he cast about to send him to purgatory. Accordingly, he sought\r\nout a powder of marvellous virtue, which he had gotten in the parts of\r\nthe Levant of a great prince who avouched it to be that which was wont\r\nto be used of the Old Man of the Mountain,[194] whenas he would fain\r\nsend any one, sleeping, into his paradise or bring him forth thereof,\r\nand that, according as more or less thereof was given, without doing\r\nany hurt, it made him who took it sleep more or less [time] on such\r\nwise that, whilst its virtue lasted, none would say he had life in\r\nhim. Of this he took as much as might suffice to make a man sleep\r\nthree days and putting it in a beaker of wine, that was not yet well\r\ncleared, gave it to Ferondo to drink in his cell, without the latter\r\nsuspecting aught; after which he carried him into the cloister and\r\nthere with some of his monks fell to making sport of him and his\r\ndunceries; nor was it long before, the powder working, Ferondo was\r\ntaken with so sudden and overpowering a drowsiness, that he slumbered\r\nas yet he stood afoot and presently fell down fast asleep.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 194: The well-known chief of the Assassins (properly\r\n_Heshashin_, _i.e._ hashish or hemp eaters). The powder in question is\r\napparently a preparation of hashish or hemp. Boccaccio seems to have\r\ntaken his idea of the Old Man of the Mountain from Marco Polo, whose\r\ntravels, published in the early part of the fourteenth century, give a\r\nmost romantic account of that chieftain and his followers.]\r\n\r\nThe abbot made a show of being concerned at this accident and letting\r\nuntruss him, caused fetch cold water and cast it in his face and essay\r\nmany other remedies of his fashion, as if he would recall the strayed\r\nlife and senses from [the oppression of] some fumosity of the stomach\r\nor what not like affection that had usurped them. The monks, seeing\r\nthat for all this he came not to himself and feeling his pulse, but\r\nfinding no sign of life in him, all held it for certain that he was\r\ndead. Accordingly, they sent to tell his wife and his kinsfolk, who\r\nall came thither forthright, and the lady having bewept him awhile\r\nwith her kinswomen, the abbot caused lay him, clad as he was, in a\r\ntomb; whilst the lady returned to her house and giving out that she\r\nmeant never to part from a little son, whom she had had by her\r\nhusband, abode at home and occupied herself with the governance of the\r\nchild and of the wealth which had been Ferondo's. Meanwhile, the abbot\r\narose stealthily in the night and with the aid of a Bolognese monk, in\r\nwhom he much trusted and who was that day come thither from Bologna,\r\ntook up Ferondo out of the tomb and carried him into a vault, in which\r\nthere was no light to be seen and which had been made for prison of\r\nsuch of the monks as should make default in aught. There they pulled\r\noff his garments and clothing him monk-fashion, laid him on a truss of\r\nstraw and there left him against he should recover his senses, whilst\r\nthe Bolognese monk, having been instructed by the abbot of that which\r\nhe had to do, without any else knowing aught thereof, proceeded to\r\nawait his coming to himself.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, the abbot, accompanied by sundry of his monks, betook\r\nhimself, by way of visitation, to the house of the lady, whom he found\r\nclad in black and in great tribulation, and having comforted her\r\nawhile, he softly required her of her promise. The lady, finding\r\nherself free and unhindered of Ferondo or any other and seeing on his\r\nfinger another fine ring, replied that she was ready and appointed him\r\nto come to her that same night. Accordingly, night come, the abbot,\r\ndisguised in Ferondo's clothes and accompanied by the monk his\r\nconfidant, repaired thither and lay with her in the utmost delight and\r\npleasance till the morning, when he returned to the abbey. After this\r\nhe very often made the same journey on a like errand and being whiles\r\nencountered, coming or going, of one or another of the villagers, it\r\nwas believed he was Ferondo who went about those parts, doing penance;\r\nby reason whereof many strange stories were after bruited about among\r\nthe simple countryfolk, and this was more than once reported to\r\nFerondo's wife, who well knew what it was.\r\n\r\nAs for Ferondo, when he recovered his senses and found himself he knew\r\nnot where, the Bolognese monk came in to him with a horrible noise and\r\nlaying hold of him, gave him a sound drubbing with a rod he had in his\r\nhand. Ferondo, weeping and crying out, did nought but ask, 'Where am\r\nI?' To which the monk answered, 'Thou art in purgatory.' 'How?' cried\r\nFerondo. 'Am I then dead?' 'Ay, certes,' replied the other; whereupon\r\nFerondo fell to bemoaning himself and his wife and child, saying the\r\noddest things in the world. Presently the monk brought him somewhat of\r\nmeat and drink, which Ferondo seeing, 'What!' cried he. 'Do the dead\r\neat?' 'Ay do they,' answered the monk. 'This that I bring thee is what\r\nthe woman, thy wife that was, sent this morning to the church to let\r\nsay masses for thy soul, and God the Lord willeth that it be made over\r\nto thee.' Quoth Ferondo, 'God grant her a good year! I still cherished\r\nher ere I died, insomuch that I held her all night in mine arms and\r\ndid nought but kiss her, and t' other thing also I did, when I had a\r\nmind thereto.' Then, being very sharp-set, he fell to eating and\r\ndrinking and himseeming the wine was not overgood, 'Lord confound\r\nher!' quoth he. 'Why did not she give the priest wine of the cask\r\nagainst the wall?'\r\n\r\nAfter he had eaten, the monk laid hold of him anew and gave him\r\nanother sound beating with the same rod; whereat Ferondo roared out\r\nlustily and said, 'Alack, why dost thou this to me?' Quoth the monk,\r\n'Because thus hath God the Lord ordained that it be done unto thee\r\ntwice every day.' 'And for what cause?' asked Ferondo. 'Because,'\r\nanswered the monk, 'thou wast jealous, having the best woman in the\r\ncountry to wife.' 'Alas!' said Ferondo. 'Thou sayst sooth, ay, and the\r\nkindest creature; she was sweeter than syrup; but I knew not that God\r\nthe Lord held it for ill that a man should be jealous; else had I not\r\nbeen so.' Quoth the monk, 'Thou shouldst have bethought thyself of\r\nthat, whenas thou wast there below,[195] and have amended thee\r\nthereof; and should it betide that thou ever return thither, look thou\r\nso have in mind that which I do unto thee at this present that thou be\r\nnevermore jealous.' 'What?' said Ferondo. 'Do the dead ever return\r\nthither?' 'Ay,' answered the monk; 'whom God willeth.' 'Marry,' cried\r\nFerondo, 'and I ever return thither, I will be the best husband in the\r\nworld; I will never beat her nor give her an ill word, except it be\r\nanent the wine she sent hither this morning and for that she sent no\r\ncandles, so it behoved me to eat in the dark.' 'Nay,' said the monk,\r\n'she sent candles enough, but they were all burnt for the masses.'\r\n'True,' rejoined Ferondo; 'and assuredly, an I return thither, I will\r\nlet her do what she will. But tell me, who art thou that usest me\r\nthus?' Quoth the monk, 'I also am dead. I was of Sardinia and for that\r\naforetime I much commended a master of mine of being jealous, I have\r\nbeen doomed of God to this punishment, that I must give thee to eat\r\nand drink and beat thee thus, till such time as God shall ordain\r\notherwhat of thee and of me.' Then said Ferondo, 'Is there none here\r\nother than we twain?' 'Ay,' answered the monk, 'there be folk by the\r\nthousands; but thou canst neither see nor hear them, nor they thee.'\r\nQuoth Ferondo, 'And how far are we from our own countries?' 'Ecod,'\r\nreplied the other, 'we are distant thence more miles than we can well\r\ncack at a bout.' 'Faith,' rejoined the farmer, 'that is far enough;\r\nmeseemeth we must be out of the world, an it be so much as all that.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: _i.e._ in the sublunary world.]\r\n\r\nIn such and the like discourse was Ferondo entertained half a score\r\nmonths with eating and drinking and beating, what while the abbot\r\nassiduously visited the fair lady, without miscarriage, and gave\r\nhimself the goodliest time in the world with her. At last, as ill-luck\r\nwould have it, the lady found herself with child and straightway\r\nacquainted the abbot therewith, wherefore it seemed well to them both\r\nthat Ferondo should without delay be recalled from purgatory to life\r\nand return to her, so she might avouch herself with child by him.\r\nAccordingly, the abbot that same night caused call to Ferondo in\r\nprison with a counterfeit voice, saying, 'Ferondo, take comfort, for\r\nit is God's pleasure that thou return to the world, where thou shalt\r\nhave a son by thy wife, whom look thou name Benedict, for that by the\r\nprayers of thy holy abbot and of thy wife and for the love of St.\r\nBenedict He doth thee this favour.' Ferondo, hearing this, was\r\nexceedingly rejoiced and said, 'It liketh me well, Lord grant a good\r\nyear to Seignior God Almighty and to the abbot and St. Benedict and my\r\ncheesy[196] sweet honey wife.' The abbot let give him, in the wine\r\nthat he sent him, so much of the powder aforesaid as should cause him\r\nsleep maybe four hours and with the aid of his monk, having put his\r\nown clothes on him, restored him privily to the tomb wherein he had\r\nbeen buried.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 196: _Sic_ (_casciata_); meaning that he loves her as well\r\nas he loves cheese, for which it is well known that the lower-class\r\nItalian has a romantic passion. According to Alexandre Dumas, the\r\nItalian loves cheese so well that he has succeeded in introducing it\r\ninto everything he eats or drinks, with the one exception of coffee.]\r\n\r\nNext morning, at break of day, Ferondo came to himself and espying\r\nlight,--a thing which he had not seen for good ten months,--through\r\nsome crevice of the tomb, doubted not but he was alive again.\r\nAccordingly, he fell to bawling out, 'Open to me! Open to me!' and\r\nheaving so lustily at the lid of the tomb with his head that he\r\nstirred it, for that it was eath to move, and had begun to move it\r\naway, when the monks, having now made an end of saying matins, ran\r\nthither and knew Ferondo's voice and saw him in act to come forth of\r\nthe sepulchre; whereupon, all aghast for the strangeness of the case,\r\nthey took to their heels and ran to the abbot, who made a show of\r\nrising from prayer and said, 'My sons, have no fear; take the cross\r\nand the holy water and follow after me, so we may see that which God\r\nwilleth to show forth to us of His might'; and as he said, so he did.\r\n\r\nNow Ferondo was come forth of the sepulchre all pale, as well might he\r\nbe who had so long abidden without seeing the sky. As soon as he saw\r\nthe abbot, he ran to cast himself at his feet and said, 'Father mine,\r\naccording to that which hath been revealed to me, your prayers and\r\nthose of St. Benedict and my wife have delivered me from the pains of\r\npurgatory and restored me to life, wherefore I pray God to give you a\r\ngood year and good calends now and always.' Quoth the abbot, 'Praised\r\nbe God His might! Go, my son, since He hath sent thee back hither;\r\ncomfort thy wife, who hath been still in tears, since thou departedst\r\nthis life, and henceforth be a friend and servant of God.' 'Sir,'\r\nreplied Ferondo, 'so hath it indeed been said to me; only leave me do;\r\nfor, as soon as I find her, I shall buss her, such goodwill do I bear\r\nher.'\r\n\r\nThe abbot, left alone with his monks, made a great show of wonderment\r\nat this miracle and caused devoutly sing Miserere therefor. As for\r\nFerondo, he returned to his village, where all who saw him fled, as\r\nmen use to do from things frightful; but he called them back and\r\navouched himself to be raised up again. His wife on like wise feigned\r\nto be adread of him; but, after the folk were somewhat reassured anent\r\nhim and saw that he was indeed alive, they questioned him of many\r\nthings, and he, as it were he had returned wise, made answer to all\r\nand gave them news of the souls of their kinsfolk, making up, of his\r\nown motion, the finest fables in the world of the affairs of purgatory\r\nand recounting in full assembly the revelation made him by the mouth\r\nof the Rangel Bragiel[197] ere he was raised up again. Then, returning\r\nto his house and entering again into possession of his goods, he got\r\nhis wife, as he thought, with child, and by chance it befell that, in\r\ndue time,--to the thinking of the fools who believe that women go just\r\nnine months with child,--the lady gave birth to a boy, who was called\r\nBenedict Ferondi.[198]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 197: _i.e._ the Angel Gabriel.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: The plural of a surname is, in strictness, always used\r\nby the Italians in speaking of a man by his full name, _dei_ being\r\nunderstood between the Christian and surname, as _Benedetto_ (_dei_)\r\n_Ferondi_, Benedict of the Ferondos or Ferondo family, whilst, when he\r\nis denominated by the surname alone, it is used in the singular, _il_\r\n(the) being understood, _e.g._ (Il) Boccaccio, (Il) Ferondo, _i.e._\r\nthe particular Boccaccio or Ferondo in question for the nonce.]\r\n\r\nFerondo's return and his talk, well nigh every one believing him to\r\nhave risen from the dead, added infinitely to the renown of the\r\nabbot's sanctity, and he himself, as if cured of his jealousy by the\r\nmany beatings he had received therefor, thenceforward, according to\r\nthe promise made by the abbot to the lady, was no more jealous;\r\nwhereat she was well pleased and lived honestly with him, as of her\r\nwont, save indeed that, whenas she conveniently might, she willingly\r\nforegathered with the holy abbot, who had so well and diligently\r\nserved her in her greatest needs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NINTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Third]\r\n\r\n     GILLETTE DE NARBONNE RECOVERETH THE KING OF FRANCE OF A\r\n     FISTULA AND DEMANDETH FOR HER HUSBAND BERTRAND DE\r\n     ROUSSILLON, WHO MARRIETH HER AGAINST HIS WILL AND BETAKETH\r\n     HIM FOR DESPITE TO FLORENCE, WHERE, HE PAYING COURT TO A\r\n     YOUNG LADY, GILLETTE, IN THE PERSON OF THE LATTER, LIETH\r\n     WITH HIM AND HATH BY HIM TWO SONS; WHEREFORE AFTER, HOLDING\r\n     HER DEAR, HE ENTERTAINETH HER FOR HIS WIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nLauretta's story being now ended, it rested but with the queen to\r\ntell, an she would not infringe upon Dioneo's privilege; wherefore,\r\nwithout waiting to be solicited by her companions, she began all\r\nblithesomely to speak thus: \"Who shall tell a story that may appear\r\ngoodly, now we have heard that of Lauretta? Certes, it was well for us\r\nthat hers was not the first, for that few of the others would have\r\npleased after it, as I misdoubt me[199] will betide of those which are\r\nyet to tell this day. Natheless, be that as it may, I will e'en\r\nrecount to you that which occurreth to me upon the proposed theme.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: Lit. and so I hope (_spero_), a curious instance of the\r\nancient Dantesque use of the word _spero_, I hope, in its contrary\r\nsense of fear.]\r\n\r\nThere was in the kingdom of France a gentleman called Isnard, Count of\r\nRoussillon, who, for that he was scant of health, still entertained\r\nabout his person a physician, by name Master Gerard de Narbonne. The\r\nsaid count had one little son, and no more, hight Bertrand, who was\r\nexceeding handsome and agreeable, and with him other children of his\r\nown age were brought up. Among these latter was a daughter of the\r\naforesaid physician, by name Gillette, who vowed to the said Bertrand\r\nan infinite love and fervent more than pertained unto her tender\r\nyears. The count dying and leaving his son in the hands of the king,\r\nit behoved him betake himself to Paris, whereof the damsel abode sore\r\ndisconsolate, and her own father dying no great while after, she would\r\nfain, an she might have had a seemly occasion, have gone to Paris to\r\nsee Bertrand: but, being straitly guarded, for that she was left rich\r\nand alone, she saw no honourable way thereto; and being now of age for\r\na husband and having never been able to forget Bertrand, she had,\r\nwithout reason assigned, refused many to whom her kinsfolk would have\r\nmarried her.\r\n\r\nNow it befell that, what while she burned more than ever for love of\r\nBertrand, for that she heard he was grown a very goodly gentleman,\r\nnews came to her how the King of France, by an imposthume which he had\r\nhad in his breast and which had been ill tended, had gotten a fistula,\r\nwhich occasioned him the utmost anguish and annoy, nor had he yet been\r\nable to find a physician who might avail to recover him thereof,\r\nalbeit many had essayed it, but all had aggravated the ill; wherefore\r\nthe king, despairing of cure, would have no more counsel nor aid of\r\nany. Hereof the young lady was beyond measure content and bethought\r\nherself that not only would this furnish her with a legitimate\r\noccasion of going to Paris, but that, should the king's ailment be\r\nsuch as she believed, she might lightly avail to have Bertrand to\r\nhusband. Accordingly, having aforetime learned many things of her\r\nfather, she made a powder of certain simples useful for such an\r\ninfirmity as she conceived the king's to be and taking horse, repaired\r\nto Paris.\r\n\r\nBefore aught else she studied to see Bertrand and next, presenting\r\nherself before the king, she prayed him of his favour to show her his\r\nailment. The king, seeing her a fair and engaging damsel, knew not how\r\nto deny her and showed her that which ailed him. Whenas she saw it,\r\nshe was certified incontinent that she could heal it and accordingly\r\nsaid, 'My lord, an it please you, I hope in God to make you whole of\r\nthis your infirmity in eight days' time, without annoy or fatigue on\r\nyour part.' The king scoffed in himself at her words, saying, 'That\r\nwhich the best physicians in the world have availed not neither known\r\nto do, how shall a young woman know?' Accordingly, he thanked her for\r\nher good will and answered that he was resolved no more to follow the\r\ncounsel of physicians. Whereupon quoth the damsel, 'My lord, you make\r\nlight of my skill, for that I am young and a woman; but I would have\r\nyou bear in mind that I medicine not of mine own science, but with the\r\naid of God and the science of Master Gerard de Narbonne, who was my\r\nfather and a famous physician whilst he lived.'\r\n\r\nThe king, hearing this, said in himself, 'It may be this woman is sent\r\nme of God; why should I not make proof of her knowledge, since she\r\nsaith she will, without annoy of mine, cure me in little time?'\r\nAccordingly, being resolved to essay her, he said, 'Damsel, and if you\r\ncure us not, after causing us break our resolution, what will you have\r\nensue to you therefor?' 'My lord,' answered she, 'set a guard upon me\r\nand if I cure you not within eight days, let burn me alive; but, if I\r\ncure you, what reward shall I have?' Quoth the king, 'You seem as yet\r\nunhusbanded; if you do this, we will marry you well and worshipfully.'\r\n'My lord,' replied the young lady, 'I am well pleased that you should\r\nmarry me, but I will have a husband such as I shall ask of you,\r\nexcepting always any one of your sons or of the royal house.' He\r\nreadily promised her that which she sought, whereupon she began her\r\ncure and in brief, before the term limited, she brought him back to\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nThe king, feeling himself healed, said, 'Damsel, you have well earned\r\nyour husband'; whereto she answered, 'Then, my lord, I have earned\r\nBertrand de Roussillon, whom I began to love even in the days of my\r\nchildhood and have ever since loved over all.' The king deemed it a\r\ngrave matter to give him to her; nevertheless, having promised her and\r\nunwilling to fail of his faith, he let call the count to himself and\r\nbespoke him thus: 'Bertrand, you are now of age and accomplished [in\r\nall that behoveth unto man's estate];[200] wherefore it is our\r\npleasure that you return to govern your county and carry with you a\r\ndamsel, whom we have given you to wife.' 'And who is the damsel, my\r\nlord?' asked Bertrand; to which the king answered, 'It is she who hath\r\nwith her medicines restored to us our health.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 200: _Fornito_, a notable example of what the illustrious\r\nLewis Carroll Dodgson, Waywode of Wonderland, calls a \"portmanteau-word,\"\r\na species that abounds in mediæval Italian, for the confusion of\r\ntranslators.]\r\n\r\nBertrand, who had seen and recognized Gillette, knowing her (albeit\r\nshe seemed to him very fair) to be of no such lineage as sorted with\r\nhis quality, said all disdainfully, 'My lord, will you then marry me\r\nto a she-leach? Now God forbid I should ever take such an one to\r\nwife!' 'Then,' said the king, 'will you have us fail of our faith, the\r\nwhich, to have our health again, we pledged to the damsel, who in\r\nguerdon thereof demanded you to husband?' 'My lord,' answered\r\nBertrand, 'you may, an you will, take from me whatsoever I possess or,\r\nas your liegeman, bestow me upon whoso pleaseth you; but of this I\r\ncertify you, that I will never be a consenting party unto such a\r\nmarriage.' 'Nay,' rejoined the king, 'but you shall, for that the\r\ndamsel is fair and wise and loveth you dear; wherefore we doubt not\r\nbut you will have a far happier life with her than with a lady of\r\nhigher lineage.' Bertrand held his peace and the king let make great\r\npreparations for the celebration of the marriage.\r\n\r\nThe appointed day being come, Bertrand, sore against his will, in the\r\npresence of the king, espoused the damsel, who loved him more than\r\nherself. This done, having already determined in himself what he\r\nshould do, he sought leave of the king to depart, saying he would fain\r\nreturn to his county and there consummate the marriage; then, taking\r\nhorse, he repaired not thither, but betook himself into Tuscany,\r\nwhere, hearing that the Florentines were at war with those of Sienna,\r\nhe determined to join himself to the former, by whom he was joyfully\r\nreceived and made captain over a certain number of men-at-arms; and\r\nthere, being well provided[201] of them, he abode a pretty while in\r\ntheir service.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 201: _i.e._ getting good pay and allowances (_avendo buona\r\nprovisione_).]\r\n\r\nThe newly-made wife, ill content with such a lot, but hoping by her\r\nfair dealing to recall him to his county, betook herself to\r\nRoussillon, where she was received of all as their liege lady. There,\r\nfinding everything waste and disordered for the long time that the\r\nland had been without a lord, with great diligence and solicitude,\r\nlike a discreet lady as she was, she set all in order again, whereof\r\nthe count's vassals were mightily content and held her exceeding dear,\r\nvowing her a great love and blaming the count sore for that he\r\naccepted not of her. The lady, having thoroughly ordered the county,\r\nnotified the count thereof by two knights, whom she despatched to him,\r\npraying him that, an it were on her account he forbore to come to his\r\ncounty, he should signify it to her and she, to pleasure him, would\r\ndepart thence; but he answered them very harshly, saying, 'For that,\r\nlet her do her pleasure; I, for my part, will return thither to abide\r\nwith her, whenas she shall have this my ring on her finger and in her\r\narms a son by me begotten.' Now the ring in question he held very dear\r\nand never parted with it, by reason of a certain virtue which it had\r\nbeen given him to understand that it had.\r\n\r\nThe knights understood the hardship of the condition implied in these\r\ntwo well nigh impossible requirements, but, seeing that they might not\r\nby their words avail to move him from his purpose, they returned to\r\nthe lady and reported to her his reply; whereat she was sore afflicted\r\nand determined, after long consideration, to seek to learn if and\r\nwhere the two things aforesaid might be compassed, to the intent that\r\nshe might, in consequence, have her husband again. Accordingly, having\r\nbethought herself what she should do, she assembled certain of the\r\nbest and chiefest men of the county and with plaintive speech very\r\norderly recounted to them that which she had already done for love of\r\nthe count and showed them what had ensued thereof, adding that it was\r\nnot her intent that, through her sojourn there, the count should abide\r\nin perpetual exile; nay, rather she purposed to spend the rest of her\r\nlife in pilgrimages and works of mercy and charity for her soul's\r\nhealth; wherefore she prayed them take the ward and governance of the\r\ncounty and notify the count that she had left him free and vacant\r\npossession and had departed the country, intending nevermore to return\r\nto Roussillon. Many were the tears shed by the good folk, whilst she\r\nspoke, and many the prayers addressed to her that it would please her\r\nchange counsel and abide there; but they availed nought. Then,\r\ncommending them to God, she set out upon her way, without telling any\r\nwhither she was bound, well furnished with monies and jewels of price\r\nand accompanied by a cousin of hers and a chamberwoman, all in\r\npilgrims' habits, and stayed not till she came to Florence, where,\r\nchancing upon a little inn, kept by a decent widow woman, she there\r\ntook up her abode and lived quietly, after the fashion of a poor\r\npilgrim, impatient to hear news of her lord.\r\n\r\nIt befell, then, that on the morrow of her arrival she saw Bertrand\r\npass before her lodging, a-horseback with his company, and albeit she\r\nknew him full well, natheless she asked the good woman of the inn who\r\nhe was. The hostess answered, 'That is a stranger gentleman, who\r\ncalleth himself Count Bertrand, a pleasant man and a courteous and\r\nmuch loved in this city; and he is the most enamoured man in the world\r\nof a she-neighbour of ours, who is a gentlewoman, but poor. Sooth to\r\nsay, she is a very virtuous damsel and abideth, being yet unmarried\r\nfor poverty, with her mother, a very good and discreet lady, but for\r\nwhom, maybe, she had already done the count's pleasure.' The countess\r\ntook good note of what she heard and having more closely enquired into\r\nevery particular and apprehended all aright, determined in herself how\r\nshe should do.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, having learned the house and name of the lady whose\r\ndaughter the count loved, she one day repaired privily thither in her\r\npilgrim's habit and finding the mother and daughter in very poor case,\r\nsaluted them and told the former that, an it pleased her, she would\r\nfain speak with her alone. The gentlewoman, rising, replied that she\r\nwas ready to hearken to her and accordingly carried her into a chamber\r\nof hers, where they seated themselves and the countess began thus,\r\n'Madam, meseemeth you are of the enemies of Fortune, even as I am;\r\nbut, an you will, belike you may be able to relieve both yourself and\r\nme.' The lady answered that she desired nothing better than to relieve\r\nherself by any honest means; and the countess went on, 'Needs must you\r\npledge me your faith, whereto an I commit myself and you deceive me,\r\nyou will mar your own affairs and mine.' 'Tell me anything you will in\r\nall assurance,' replied the gentlewoman; 'for never shall you find\r\nyourself deceived of me.'\r\n\r\nThereupon the countess, beginning with her first enamourment,\r\nrecounted to her who she was and all that had betided her to that day\r\nafter such a fashion that the gentlewoman, putting faith in her words\r\nand having, indeed, already in part heard her story from others, began\r\nto have compassion of her. The countess, having related her\r\nadventures, went on to say, 'You have now, amongst my other troubles,\r\nheard what are the two things which it behoveth me have, an I would\r\nhave my husband, and to which I know none who can help me, save only\r\nyourself, if that be true which I hear, to wit, that the count my\r\nhusband is passionately enamoured of your daughter.' 'Madam,' answered\r\nthe gentlewoman, 'if the count love my daughter I know not; indeed he\r\nmaketh a great show thereof. But, an it be so, what can I do in this\r\nthat you desire?' 'Madam,' rejoined the countess, 'I will tell you;\r\nbut first I will e'en show you what I purpose shall ensue thereof to\r\nyou, an you serve me. I see your daughter fair and of age for a\r\nhusband and according to what I have heard, meseemeth I understand the\r\nlack of good to marry her withal it is that causeth you keep her at\r\nhome. Now I purpose, in requital of the service you shall do me, to\r\ngive her forthright of mine own monies such a dowry as you yourself\r\nshall deem necessary to marry her honorably.'\r\n\r\nThe mother, being needy, was pleased with the offer; algates, having\r\nthe spirit of a gentlewoman, she said, 'Madam, tell me what I can do\r\nfor you; if it consist with my honour, I will willingly do it, and you\r\nshall after do that which shall please you.' Then said the countess,\r\n'It behoveth me that you let tell the count my husband by some one in\r\nwhom you trust, that your daughter is ready to do his every pleasure,\r\nso she may but be certified that he loveth her as he pretendeth, the\r\nwhich she will never believe, except he send her the ring which he\r\ncarrieth on his finger and by which she hath heard he setteth such\r\nstore. An he send you the ring, you must give it to me and after send\r\nto him to say that your daughter is ready do his pleasure; then bring\r\nhim hither in secret and privily put me to bed to him in the stead of\r\nyour daughter. It may be God will vouchsafe me to conceive and on this\r\nwise, having his ring on my finger and a child in mine arms of him\r\nbegotten, I shall presently regain him and abide with him, as a wife\r\nshould abide with her husband, and you will have been the cause\r\nthereof.'\r\n\r\nThis seemed a grave matter to the gentlewoman, who feared lest blame\r\nshould haply ensue thereof to her daughter; nevertheless, bethinking\r\nher it were honourably done to help the poor lady recover her husband\r\nand that she went about to do this to a worthy end and trusting in the\r\ngood and honest intention of the countess, she not only promised her\r\nto do it, but, before many days, dealing with prudence and secrecy, in\r\naccordance with the latter's instructions, she both got the ring\r\n(albeit this seemed somewhat grievous to the count) and adroitly put\r\nher to bed with her husband, in the place of her own daughter. In\r\nthese first embracements, most ardently sought of the count, the lady,\r\nby God's pleasure, became with child of two sons, as her delivery in\r\ndue time made manifest. Nor once only, but many times, did the\r\ngentlewoman gratify the countess with her husband's embraces,\r\ncontriving so secretly that never was a word known of the matter,\r\nwhilst the count still believed himself to have been, not with his\r\nwife, but with her whom he loved; and whenas he came to take leave of\r\na morning, he gave her, at one time and another, divers goodly and\r\nprecious jewels, which the countess laid up with all diligence.\r\n\r\nThen, feeling herself with child and unwilling to burden the\r\ngentlewoman farther with such an office, she said to her, 'Madam,\r\nthanks to God and you, I have gotten that which I desired, wherefore\r\nit is time that I do that which shall content you and after get me\r\ngone hence.' The gentlewoman answered that, if she had gotten that\r\nwhich contented her, she was well pleased, but that she had not done\r\nthis of any hope of reward, nay, for that herseemed it behoved her to\r\ndo it, an she would do well. 'Madam,' rejoined the countess, 'that\r\nwhich you say liketh me well and so on my part I purpose not to give\r\nyou that which you shall ask of me by way of reward, but to do well,\r\nfor that meseemeth behoveful so to do.' The gentlewoman, then,\r\nconstrained by necessity, with the utmost shamefastness, asked her an\r\nhundred pounds to marry her daughter withal; but the countess, seeing\r\nher confusion and hearing her modest demand, gave her five hundred and\r\nso many rare and precious jewels as were worth maybe as much more.\r\nWith this the gentlewoman was far more than satisfied and rendered the\r\ncountess the best thanks in her power; whereupon the latter, taking\r\nleave of her, returned to the inn, whilst the other, to deprive\r\nBertrand of all farther occasion of coming or sending to her house,\r\nremoved with her daughter into the country to the house of one of her\r\nkinsfolk, and he, being a little after recalled by his vassals and\r\nhearing that the countess had departed the country, returned to his\r\nown house.\r\n\r\nThe countess, hearing that he had departed Florence and returned to\r\nhis county, was mightily rejoiced and abode at Florence till her time\r\ncame to be delivered, when she gave birth to two male children, most\r\nlike their father, and let rear them with all diligence. Whenas it\r\nseemed to her time, she set out and came, without being known of any,\r\nto Montpellier, where having rested some days and made enquiry of the\r\ncount and where he was, she learned that he was to hold a great\r\nentertainment of knights and ladies at Roussillon on All Saints' Day\r\nand betook herself thither, still in her pilgrim's habit that she was\r\nwont to wear. Finding the knights and ladies assembled in the count's\r\npalace and about to sit down to table, she went up, with her children\r\nin her arms and without changing her dress, into the banqueting hall\r\nand making her way between man and man whereas she saw the count, cast\r\nherself at his feet and said, weeping, 'I am thine unhappy wife, who,\r\nto let thee return and abide in thy house, have long gone wandering\r\nmiserably about the world. I conjure thee, in the name of God, to\r\naccomplish unto me thy promise upon the condition appointed me by the\r\ntwo knights I sent thee; for, behold, here in mine arms is not only\r\none son of thine, but two, and here is thy ring. It is time, then,\r\nthat I be received of thee as a wife, according to thy promise.'\r\n\r\nThe count, hearing this, was all confounded and recognized the ring\r\nand the children also, so like were they to him; but yet he said, 'How\r\ncan this have come to pass?' The countess, then, to his exceeding\r\nwonderment and that of all others who were present, orderly recounted\r\nthat which had passed and how it had happened; whereupon the count,\r\nfeeling that she spoke sooth and seeing her constancy and wit and\r\nmoreover two such goodly children, as well for the observance of his\r\npromise as to pleasure all his liegemen and the ladies, who all\r\nbesought him thenceforth to receive and honour her as his lawful wife,\r\nput off his obstinate despite and raising the countess to her feet,\r\nembraced her and kissing her, acknowledged her for his lawful wife and\r\nthose for his children. Then, letting clothe her in apparel such as\r\nbeseemed her quality, to the exceeding joyance of as many as were\r\nthere and of all other his vassals who heard the news, he held high\r\nfestival, not only all that day, but sundry others, and from that day\r\nforth still honoured her as his bride and his wife and loved and\r\ntendered her over all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TENTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Third]\r\n\r\n     ALIBECH, TURNING HERMIT, IS TAUGHT BY RUSTICO, A MONK, TO\r\n     PUT THE DEVIL IN HELL, AND BEING AFTER BROUGHT AWAY THENCE,\r\n     BECOMETH NEERBALE HIS WIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nDioneo, who had diligently hearkened to the queen's story, seeing that\r\nit was ended and that it rested with him alone to tell, without\r\nawaiting commandment, smilingly began to speak as follows: \"Charming\r\nladies, maybe you have never heard tell how one putteth the devil in\r\nhell; wherefore, without much departing from the tenor of that\r\nwhereof you have discoursed all this day, I will e'en tell it you.\r\nBelike, having learned it, you may catch the spirit[202] thereof and\r\ncome to know that, albeit Love sojourneth liefer in jocund palaces and\r\nluxurious chambers than in the hovels of the poor, yet none the less\r\ndoth he whiles make his power felt midmost thick forests and rugged\r\nmountains and in desert caverns; whereby it may be understood that all\r\nthings are subject to his puissance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 202: _Guadagnare l'anima_, lit. gain the soul (syn. pith,\r\nkernel, substance). This passage is ambiguous and should perhaps be\r\nrendered \"catch the knack or trick\" or \"acquire the wish.\"]\r\n\r\nTo come, then, to the fact, I say that in the city of Capsa in Barbary\r\nthere was aforetime a very rich man, who, among his other children,\r\nhad a fair and winsome young daughter, by name Alibech. She, not being\r\na Christian and hearing many Christians who abode in the town mightily\r\nextol the Christian faith and the service of God, one day questioned\r\none of them in what manner one might avail to serve God with the least\r\nhindrance. The other answered that they best served God who most\r\nstrictly eschewed the things of the world, as those did who had\r\nbetaken them into the solitudes of the deserts of Thebais. The girl,\r\nwho was maybe fourteen years old and very simple, moved by no ordered\r\ndesire, but by some childish fancy, set off next morning by stealth\r\nand all alone, to go to the desert of Thebais, without letting any\r\nknow her intent. After some days, her desire persisting, she won, with\r\nno little toil, to the deserts in question and seeing a hut afar off,\r\nwent thither and found at the door a holy man, who marvelled to see\r\nher there and asked her what she sought. She replied that, being\r\ninspired of God, she went seeking to enter into His service and was\r\nnow in quest of one who should teach her how it behoved to serve Him.\r\n\r\nThe worthy man, seeing her young and very fair and fearing lest, an he\r\nentertained her, the devil should beguile him, commended her pious\r\nintent and giving her somewhat to eat of roots of herbs and wild\r\napples and dates and to drink of water, said to her, 'Daughter mine,\r\nnot far hence is a holy man, who is a much better master than I of\r\nthat which thou goest seeking; do thou betake thyself to him'; and put\r\nher in the way. However, when she reached the man in question, she had\r\nof him the same answer and faring farther, came to the cell of a young\r\nhermit, a very devout and good man, whose name was Rustico and to whom\r\nshe made the same request as she had done to the others. He, having a\r\nmind to make a trial of his own constancy, sent her not away, as the\r\nothers had done, but received her into his cell, and the night being\r\ncome, he made her a little bed of palm-fronds and bade her lie down to\r\nrest thereon. This done, temptations tarried not to give battle to his\r\npowers of resistance and he, finding himself grossly deceived by these\r\nlatter, turned tail, without awaiting many assaults, and confessed\r\nhimself beaten; then, laying aside devout thoughts and orisons and\r\nmortifications, he fell to revolving in his memory the youth and\r\nbeauty of the damsel and bethinking himself what course he should take\r\nwith her, so as to win to that which he desired of her, without her\r\ntaking him for a debauched fellow.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, having sounded her with sundry questions, he found that\r\nshe had never known man and was in truth as simple as she seemed;\r\nwherefore he bethought him how, under colour of the service of God, he\r\nmight bring her to his pleasures. In the first place, he showeth her\r\nwith many words how great an enemy the devil was of God the Lord and\r\nafter gave her to understand that the most acceptable service that\r\ncould be rendered to God was to put back the devil into hell, whereto\r\nhe had condemned him. The girl asked him how this might be done; and\r\nhe, 'Thou shalt soon know that; do thou but as thou shalt see me do.'\r\nSo saying, he proceeded to put off the few garments he had and abode\r\nstark naked, as likewise did the girl, whereupon he fell on his knees,\r\nas he would pray, and caused her abide over against himself.[203]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 203: The translators regret that the disuse into which magic\r\nhas fallen, makes it impossible to render the technicalities of that\r\nmysterious art into tolerable English; they have therefore found it\r\nnecessary to insert several passages in the original Italian.]\r\n\r\nE cosí stando, essendo Rustico, piú che mai, nel suo disidero acceso,\r\nper lo vederla cosí bella, venue la resurrezion della carne; la quale\r\nriguardando Alibech, e maravigliatasti, disse: Rustico, quella che cosa\r\nè, che io ti veggio, che cosí si pigne in fuori, e non l' ho io? O\r\nfigliuola mia, disse Rustico, questo è il diavolo, di che io t'ho\r\nparlato, e vedi tu ora: egli mi dà grandissima molestia, tanta, che io\r\nappena la posso sofferire. Allora disse la giovane. O lodato sia Iddio,\r\nché io veggio, che io sto meglio, che non stai tu, ché io non ho\r\ncotesto diavolo io. Disse Rustico, tu di vero; ma tu hai un' altra\r\ncosa, che non l'ho io, et haila in iscambio di questo. Disse Alibech: O\r\nche? A cui Rustico disse: Hai l'inferno; e dicoti, che io mi credo, che\r\nDio t'abbia qui mandata per la salute dell' anima mia; perciòche, se\r\nquesto diavolo pur mi darà questa noia, ove tu cogli aver di me tanta\r\npietà, e sofferire, che io in inferno il rimetta; tu mi darai\r\ngrandissima consolazione, et a Dio farai grandissimo piacere, e\r\nservigio; se tu per quello fare in queste parti venuta se; che tu di.\r\nLa giovane di buona fede rispose O padre mio, poscia che io ho\r\nl'inferno, sia pure quando vi piacerà mettervi il diavolo. Disse allora\r\nRustico: Figliuola mia benedetta sia tu: andiamo dunque, e\r\nrimettiamlovi sí, che egli poscia mi lasci stare. E cosí detto, menate\r\nla giovane sopra uno de' loro letticelli, le 'nsegnò, come star si\r\ndovesse a dover incarcerare quel maladetto da Dio. La giovane, che mai\r\npiú non aveva in inferno messo diavolo alcuno, per la prima volta sentí\r\nun poco di noia; perché ella disse a Rustico.\r\n\r\nPer certo, padre mio, mala cosa dee essere questo diavolo, e veramente\r\nnimico di Iddio ché ancora all'inferno, non che altrui duole quando,\r\negli v'è dentro rimesso. Disse Rustico: Figliuola, egli non averrà\r\nsempre cosí: e per fare, che questo non avvenisse, da sei volte anziche\r\ndi su il letticel si movesero, ve 'l rimisero; tantoche per quella\r\nvolta gli trasser sí la superbia del capo, che egli si stette\r\nvolentieri in pace. Ma ritornatagli poi nel seguente tempo piú volte, e\r\nla giovane ubbidente sempre a trargliela si disponesse, avvenne, che il\r\ngiuoco le cominciò a piacere; e cominciò a dire a Rustico. Ben veggio,\r\nche il ver dicevano que valenti uomini in Capsa, che il servire a Dio\r\nera cosí dolce cosa, e per certo io non mi ricordo, che mai alcuna\r\naltra ne facessi, che di tanto diletto, e piacere mi fosse, quanto è il\r\nrimettere il diavolo in inferno; e perciò giudico ogn' altra persona,\r\nche ad altro che a servire a Dio attende, essere una bestia. Per la\r\nqual cosa essa spesse volte andava a Rustico, e gli diceva. Padre mio,\r\nio son qui venuta per servire a Dio, e non per istare oziosa; andiamo a\r\nrimittere il diavolo in inferno. La qual cosa faccendo, diceva ella\r\nalcuna volta. Rustico, io non so perché il diavolo si fugga di\r\nninferno, ché s' egli vi stesse cosí volentiere, come l'inferno il\r\nriceve, e tiene; agli non sene uscirebbe mai. Cosí adunque invitando\r\nspesso la giovane Rustico, et al servigio di Dio confortandolo, se la\r\nbambagia del farsetto tratta gli avea, che egli a talora sentiva\r\nfreddo, che un' altro sarebbe sudato; e perciò egli incominciò a dire\r\nalla giovane, che il diavolo non era da gastigare, né da rimettere in\r\ninferno, se non quando egli per superbia levasse il capo; e noi, per la\r\ngrazia, di Dio, l'abbiamo sí sgannato, che egla priega Iddio di starsi\r\nin pace: e cosí alquanto impose di silenzio alla giovane. La qual,\r\npoiche vide che Rustico non la richiedeva a dovere il diavolo rimittere\r\nin inferno, gli disse un giorno. Rustico, se il diavolo tuo è\r\ngastigato, e piú non ti dà noia me il mio ninferno non lascia stare:\r\nperché tu farai bene, che tu col tuo diavolo aiuti ad attutare la\r\nrabbia al mio inferno; come io col mio ninferno ho ajutato a trarre la\r\nsuperbia al tuo diavolo.\r\n\r\n_Transcriber's Note:_ The following is a 1886 translation of this\r\npassage by John Payne, printed for the Villon Society by private\r\nsubscription and for private circulation only:\r\n\r\n   Matters standing thus and Rustico being more than ever inflamed in\r\n   his desires to see her so fair, there came the resurrection of the\r\n   flesh, which Alibech observing and marvelling, 'Rustico,' quoth she,\r\n   'what is that I see on thee which thrusteth forth thus and which I\r\n   have not?' 'Faith, daughter mine,' answered he, 'this is the devil\r\n   whereof I bespoke thee; and see now, he giveth me such sore annoy\r\n   that I can scarce put up with it.' Then said the girl, 'Now praised\r\n   be God! I see I fare better than thou, in that I have none of yonder\r\n   devil.' 'True,' rejoined Rustico; 'but thou hast otherwhat that I\r\n   have not, and thou hast it instead of this.' 'What is that?' asked\r\n   Alibech; and he, 'Thou hast hell, and I tell thee methinketh God\r\n   hath sent thee hither for my soul's health, for that, whenas this\r\n   devil doth me this annoy, an it please thee have so much compassion\r\n   on me as to suffer me put him back into hell, thou wilt give me the\r\n   utmost solacement and wilt do God a very great pleasure and service,\r\n   so indeed thou be come into these parts to do as thou sayst.'\r\n\r\n   The girl answered in good faith, 'Marry, father mine, since I have\r\n   hell, be it whensoever it pleaseth thee;' whereupon quoth Rustico,\r\n   'Daughter, blessed be thou; let us go then and put him back there,\r\n   so he may after leave me in peace.' So saying, he laid her on one of\r\n   their little beds and taught her how she should do to imprison that\r\n   accursed one of God. The girl, who had never yet put any devil in\r\n   hell, for the first time felt some little pain; wherefore she said\r\n   to Rustico, 'Certes, father mine, this same devil must be an ill\r\n   thing and an enemy in very deed of God, for that it irketh hell\r\n   itself, let be otherwhat, when he is put back therein.' 'Daughter,'\r\n   answered Rustico, 'it will not always happen thus;' and to the end\r\n   that this should not happen, six times, or ever they stirred from\r\n   the bed, they put him in hell again, insomuch that for the nonce\r\n   they so took the conceit out of his head that he willingly abode at\r\n   peace. But, it returning to him again and again the ensuing days and\r\n   the obedient girl still lending herself to take it out of him, it\r\n   befell that the sport began to please her and she said to Rustico,\r\n   'I see now that those good people in Capsa spoke sooth, when they\r\n   avouched that it was so sweet a thing to serve God; for, certes, I\r\n   remember me not to have ever done aught that afforded me such\r\n   pleasance and delight as putting the devil in hell; wherefore\r\n   methinketh that whoso applieth himself unto aught other than God His\r\n   service is a fool.'\r\n\r\n   Accordingly, she came ofttimes to Rustico and said to him, 'Father\r\n   mine, I came here to serve God and not to abide idle; let us go put\r\n   the devil in hell.' Which doing, she said whiles, 'Rustico, I know\r\n   not why the devil fleeth away from hell; for, an he abode there as\r\n   willingly as hell receiveth him and holdeth him, he would never come\r\n   forth therefrom.' The girl, then, on this wise often inviting\r\n   Rustico and exhorting him to the service of God, so took the bombast\r\n   out of his doublet that he felt cold what time another had sweated;\r\n   wherefore he fell to telling her that the devil was not to be\r\n   chastised nor put into hell, save whenas he should lift up his head\r\n   for pride; 'and we,' added he, 'by God's grace, have so baffled him\r\n   that he prayeth our Lord to suffer him abide in peace;' and on this\r\n   wise he for awhile imposed silence on her. However, when she saw\r\n   that he required her not of putting the devil in hell, she said to\r\n   him one day, 'Rustico, an thy devil be chastened and give thee no\r\n   more annoy, my hell letteth me not be; wherefore thou wilt do well\r\n   to aid me with thy devil in abating the raging of my hell, even as\r\n   with my hell I have helped thee take the conceit out of thy devil.'\r\n\r\nRustico, who lived on roots and water, could ill avail to answer her\r\ncalls and told her that it would need overmany devils to appease hell,\r\nbut he would do what he might thereof. Accordingly he satisfied her\r\nbytimes, but so seldom it was but casting a bean into the lion's\r\nmouth; whereas the girl, herseeming she served not God as diligently\r\nas she would fain have done, murmured somewhat. But, whilst this\r\ndebate was toward between Rustico his devil and Alibech her hell, for\r\novermuch desire on the one part and lack of power on the other, it\r\nbefell that a fire broke out in Capsa and burnt Alibech's father in\r\nhis own house, with as many children and other family as he had; by\r\nreason whereof she abode heir to all his good. Thereupon, a young man\r\ncalled Neerbale, who had spent all his substance in gallantry, hearing\r\nthat she was alive, set out in search of her and finding her, before\r\nthe court[204] had laid hands upon her father's estate, as that of a\r\nman dying without heir, to Rustico's great satisfaction, but against\r\nher own will, brought her back to Capsa, where he took her to wife and\r\nsucceeded, in her right, to the ample inheritance of her father.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 204: _i.e._ the government (_corte_).]\r\n\r\nThere, being asked by the women at what she served God in the desert,\r\nshe answered (Neerbale having not yet lain with her) that she served\r\nHim at putting the devil in hell and that Neerbale had done a grievous\r\nsin in that he had taken her from such service. The ladies asked, 'How\r\nputteth one the devil in hell?' And the girl, what with words and\r\nwhat with gestures, expounded it to them; whereat they set up so great\r\na laughing that they laugh yet and said, 'Give yourself no concern, my\r\nchild; nay, for that is done here also and Neerbale will serve our\r\nLord full well with thee at this.' Thereafter, telling it from one to\r\nanother throughout the city, they brought it to a common saying there\r\nthat the most acceptable service one could render to God was to put\r\nthe devil in hell, which byword, having passed the sea hither, is yet\r\ncurrent here. Wherefore do all you young ladies, who have need of\r\nGod's grace, learn to put the devil in hell, for that this is highly\r\nacceptable to Him and pleasing to both parties and much good may grow\r\nand ensue thereof.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA thousand times or more had Dioneo's story moved the modest ladies to\r\nlaughter, so quaint and comical did his words appear to them; then,\r\nwhenas he had made an end thereof, the queen, knowing the term of her\r\nsovranty to be come, lifted the laurel from her head and set it\r\nmerrily on that of Filostrato, saying: \"We shall presently see if the\r\nwolf will know how to govern the ewes better than the ewes have\r\ngoverned the wolves.\" Filostrato, hearing this, said, laughing, \"An I\r\nwere hearkened to, the wolves had taught the ewes to put the devil in\r\nhell, no worse than Rustico taught Alibech; wherefore do ye not style\r\nus wolven, since you yourselves have not been ewen. Algates, I will\r\ngovern the kingdom committed to me to the best of my power.\" \"Harkye,\r\nFilostrato,\" rejoined Neifile, \"in seeking to teach us, you might have\r\nchanced to learn sense, even as did Masetto of Lamporecchio of the\r\nnuns, and find your tongue what time your bones should have learnt to\r\nwhistle without a master.\"\r\n\r\nFilostrato, finding that he still got a Roland for his Oliver,[205]\r\ngave over pleasantry and addressed himself to the governance of the\r\nkingdom committed to him. Wherefore, letting call the seneschal, he\r\nwas fain to know at what point things stood all and after discreetly\r\nordained that which he judged would be well and would content the\r\ncompany for such time as his seignory should endure. Then, turning to\r\nthe ladies, \"Lovesome ladies,\" quoth he, \"since I knew good from evil,\r\nI have, for my ill fortune, been still subject unto Love for the\r\ncharms of one or other of you; nor hath humility neither obedience,\r\nno, nor the assiduous ensuing him in all his usances, in so far as it\r\nhath been known of me, availed me but that first I have been abandoned\r\nfor another and after have still gone from bad to worse; and so I\r\nbelieve I shall fare unto my death; wherefore it pleaseth me that it\r\nbe discoursed to-morrow of none other matter than that which is most\r\nconformable to mine own case, to wit, OF THOSE WHOSE LOVES HAVE HAD\r\nUNHAPPY ENDING, for that I in the long run look for a most unhappy\r\n[issue to mine own]; nor was the name by which you call me conferred\r\non me for otherwhat by such an one who knew well what it meant.\"[206]\r\nSo saying, he rose to his feet and dismissed every one until\r\nsupper-time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 205: Lit. that scythes were no less plenty that he had\r\narrows (_che falci si trovavano non meno che egli avesse strali_), a\r\nproverbial expression the exact bearing of which I do not know, but\r\nwhose evident sense I have rendered in the equivalent English idiom.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 206: Syn. what he said (_che si dire_). See ante, p. 11,\r\nnote.]\r\n\r\nThe garden was so goodly and so delightsome that there was none who\r\nelected to go forth thereof, in the hope of finding more pleasance\r\nelsewhere. Nay, the sun, now grown mild, making it nowise irksome to\r\ngive chase to the fawns and kids and rabbits and other beasts which\r\nwere thereabout and which, as they sat, had come maybe an hundred\r\ntimes to disturb them by skipping through their midst, some addressed\r\nthemselves to pursue them. Dioneo and Fiammetta fell to singing of\r\nMesser Guglielmo and the Lady of Vergiu,[207] whilst Filomena and\r\nPamfilo sat down to chess; and so, some doing one thing and some\r\nanother, the time passed on such wise that the hour of supper came\r\nwell nigh unlooked for; whereupon, the tables being set round about\r\nthe fair fountain, they supped there in the evening with the utmost\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 207: Apparently the well-known fabliau of the Dame de Vergy,\r\nupon which Marguerite d'Angoulême founded the seventieth story of the\r\nHeptameron.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the tables were taken away, Filostrato, not to depart from\r\nthe course holden of those who had been queens before him, commanded\r\nLauretta to lead up a dance and sing a song. \"My lord,\" answered she,\r\n\"I know none of other folk's songs, nor have I in mind any of mine own\r\nwhich should best beseem so joyous a company; but, an you choose one\r\nof those which I have, I will willingly sing it.\" Quote the king,\r\n\"Nothing of thine can be other than goodly and pleasing; wherefore\r\nsing us such as thou hast.\" Lauretta, then, with a sweet voice enough,\r\nbut in a somewhat plaintive style, began thus, the other ladies\r\nanswering:\r\n\r\n       No maid disconsolate\r\n         Hath cause as I, alack!\r\n       Who sigh for love in vain, to mourn her fate.\r\n\r\n     He who moves heaven and all the stars in air\r\n       Made me for His delight\r\n     Lovesome and sprightly, kind and debonair,\r\n       E'en here below to give each lofty spright\r\n     Some inkling of that fair\r\n       That still in heaven abideth in His sight;\r\n       But erring men's unright,\r\n         Ill knowing me, my worth\r\n           Accepted not, nay, with dispraise did bate.\r\n\r\n     Erst was there one who held me dear and fain\r\n       Took me, a youngling maid,\r\n     Into his arms and thought and heart and brain,\r\n       Caught fire at my sweet eyes; yea time, unstayed\r\n     Of aught, that flits amain\r\n       And lightly, all to wooing me he laid.\r\n       I, courteous, nought gainsaid\r\n         And held[208] him worthy me;\r\n           But now, woe's me, of him I'm desolate.\r\n\r\n     Then unto me there did himself present\r\n       A youngling proud and haught,\r\n     Renowning him for valorous and gent;\r\n       He took and holds me and with erring thought[209]\r\n     To jealousy is bent;\r\n       Whence I, alack! nigh to despair am wrought,\r\n       As knowing myself,--brought\r\n         Into this world for good\r\n           Of many an one,--engrossed of one sole mate.\r\n\r\n     The luckless hour I curse, in very deed,\r\n       When I, alas! said yea,\r\n     Vesture to change,--so fair in that dusk wede\r\n       I was and glad, whereas in this more gay\r\n     A weary life I lead,\r\n       Far less than erst held honest, welaway!\r\n       Ah, dolorous bridal day,\r\n         Would God I had been dead\r\n           Or e'er I proved thee in such ill estate!\r\n\r\n     O lover dear, with whom well pleased was I\r\n       Whilere past all that be,--\r\n     Who now before Him sittest in the sky\r\n       Who fashioned us,--have pity upon me\r\n     Who cannot, though I die,\r\n       Forget thee for another; cause me see\r\n       The flame that kindled thee\r\n         For me lives yet unquenched\r\n           And my recall up thither[210] impetrate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 208: Lit. made (_Di me il feci digno_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 209: _i.e._ false suspicion (_falso pensiero_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 210: _i.e._ to heaven (_e costa su m'impetra la tornata_).]\r\n\r\nHere Lauretta made an end of her song, wherein, albeit attentively\r\nfollowed of all, she was diversely apprehended of divers persons, and\r\nthere were those who would e'en understand, Milan-fashion, that a good\r\nhog was better than a handsome wench;[211] but others were of a\r\nloftier and better and truer apprehension, whereof it booteth not to\r\ntell at this present. Thereafter the king let kindle store of\r\nflambeaux upon the grass and among the flowers and caused sing divers\r\nother songs, until every star began to decline, that was above the\r\nhorizon, when, deeming it time for sleep, he bade all with a good\r\nnight betake themselves to their chambers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 211: The pertinence of this allusion, which probably refers\r\nto some current Milanese proverbial saying, the word _tosa_, here used\r\nby Boccaccio for \"wench,\" belonging to the Lombard dialect, is not\r\nvery clear. The expression \"Milan-fashion\" (_alla melanese_) may be\r\nsupposed to refer to the proverbial materialism of the people of\r\nLombardy.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE ENDETH THE THIRD DAY\r\nOF THE DECAMERON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Day the Fourth_\r\n\r\n     HERE BEGINNETH THE FOURTH DAY OF THE DECAMERON WHEREIN UNDER\r\n     THE GOVERNANCE OF FILOSTRATO IS DISCOURSED OF THOSE WHOSE\r\n     LOVES HAVE HAD UNHAPPY ENDINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nDearest ladies, as well by words of wise men heard as by things many a\r\ntime both seen and read of myself, I had conceived that the boisterous\r\nand burning blast of envy was apt to smite none but lofty towers or\r\nthe highest summits of the trees; but I find myself mistaken in my\r\nconceit, for that, fleeing, as I have still studied to flee, from the\r\ncruel onslaught of that raging wind, I have striven to go, not only in\r\nthe plains, but in the very deepest of the valleys, as many manifestly\r\nenough appear to whoso considereth these present stories, the which\r\nhave been written by me, not only in vulgar Florentine and in prose\r\nand without [author's] name, but eke in as humble and sober a style as\r\nmight be. Yet for all this have I not availed to escape being cruelly\r\nshaken, nay, well nigh uprooted, of the aforesaid wind and all torn of\r\nthe fangs of envy; wherefore I can very manifestly understand that to\r\nbe true which the wise use to say, to wit, that misery alone in things\r\npresent is without envy.[212]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 212: Sic (_senza invidia_); but the meaning is that misery\r\nalone is without _enviers_.]\r\n\r\nThere are then, discreet ladies, some who, reading these stories, have\r\nsaid that you please me overmuch and that it is not a seemly thing\r\nthat I should take so much delight in pleasuring and solacing you; and\r\nsome have said yet worse of commending you as I do. Others, making a\r\nshow of wishing to speak more maturely, have said that it sorteth ill\r\nwith mine age henceforth to follow after things of this kind, to wit,\r\nto discourse of women or to study to please them. And many, feigning\r\nthemselves mighty tender of my repute, avouch that I should do more\r\nwisely to abide with the Muses on Parnassus than to busy myself among\r\nyou with these toys. Again, there be some who, speaking more\r\ndespitefully than advisedly, have said that I should do more\r\ndiscreetly to consider whence I might get me bread than to go peddling\r\nafter these baubles, feeding upon wind; and certain others, in\r\ndisparagement of my pains, study to prove the things recounted by me\r\nto have been otherwise than as I present them to you.\r\n\r\nWith such, then, and so many blusterings,[213] such atrocious\r\nbackbitings, such needle-pricks, noble ladies, am I, what while I\r\nbattle in your service, baffled and buffeted and transfixed even to\r\nthe quick. The which things, God knoweth, I hear and apprehend with an\r\nuntroubled mind; and albeit my defence in this pertaineth altogether\r\nunto you, natheless, I purpose not to spare mine own pains; nay,\r\nwithout answering so much [at large] as it might behove, I mean to rid\r\nmine ears of them with some slight rejoinder, and that without delay;\r\nfor that if even now, I being not yet come to[214] the third part of\r\nmy travail, they[215] are many and presume amain, I opine that, ere I\r\ncome to the end thereof, they may, having had no rebuff at the first,\r\non such wise be multiplied that with whatsoever little pains of theirs\r\nthey might overthrow me, nor might your powers, great though they be,\r\navail to withstand this.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 213: _i.e._ blasts of calumny.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 214: _i.e._ having not yet accomplished.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 215: _i.e._ my censors.]\r\n\r\nBut, ere I come to make answer to any of them, it pleaseth me, in mine\r\nown defence, to relate, not an entire story,--lest it should seem I\r\nwould fain mingle mine own stories with those of so commendable a\r\ncompany as that which I have presented to you,--but a part of\r\none,--that so its very default [of completeness] may attest that it is\r\nnone of those,--and accordingly, speaking to my assailants, I say that\r\nin our city, a good while agone, there was a townsman, by name Filippo\r\nBalducci, a man of mean enough extraction, but rich and well addressed\r\nand versed in such matters as his condition comported. He had a wife,\r\nwhom he loved with an exceeding love, as she him, and they lived a\r\npeaceful life together, studying nothing so much as wholly to please\r\none another. In course of time it came to pass, as it cometh to pass\r\nof all, that the good lady departed this life and left Filippo nought\r\nof herself but one only son, begotten of him and maybe two years old.\r\nFilippo for the death of his lady abode as disconsolate as ever man\r\nmight, having lost a beloved one, and seeing himself left alone and\r\nforlorn of that company which most he loved, he resolved to be no more\r\nof the world, but to give himself altogether to the service of God and\r\ndo the like with his little son. Wherefore, bestowing all his good for\r\nthe love of God,[216] he repaired without delay to the top of Mount\r\nAsinajo, where he took up his abode with his son in a little hut and\r\nthere living with him upon alms, in the practice of fasts and prayers,\r\nstraitly guarded himself from discoursing whereas the boy was, of any\r\ntemporal thing, neither suffered him see aught thereof, lest this\r\nshould divert him from the service aforesaid, but still bespoke him of\r\nthe glories of life eternal and of God and the saints, teaching him\r\nnought but pious orisons; and in this way of life he kept him many\r\nyears, never suffering him go forth of the hermitage nor showing him\r\naught other than himself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: _i.e._ in alms.]\r\n\r\nNow the good man was used to come whiles into Florence, where being\r\nsuccoured, according to his occasions, of the friends of God, he\r\nreturned to his hut, and it chanced one day that, his son being now\r\neighteen years old and Filippo an old man, the lad asked him whither\r\nhe went. Filippo told him and the boy said, \"Father mine, you are now\r\nan old man and can ill endure fatigue; why do you not whiles carry me\r\nto Florence and bring me to know the friends and devotees of God and\r\nyourself, to the end that I, who am young and better able to toil than\r\nyou, may after, whenas it pleaseth you, go to Florence for our\r\noccasions, whilst you abide here?\" The worthy man, considering that\r\nhis son was now grown to man's estate and thinking him so inured to\r\nthe service of God that the things of this world might thenceforth\r\nuneath allure him to themselves, said in himself, \"The lad saith\r\nwell\"; and accordingly, having occasion to go thither, he carried him\r\nwith him. There the youth, seeing the palaces, the houses, the\r\nchurches and all the other things whereof one seeth all the city full,\r\nbegan, as one who had never to his recollection beheld the like, to\r\nmarvel amain and questioned his father of many things what they were\r\nand how they were called. Filippo told him and he, hearing him, abode\r\ncontent and questioned of somewhat else.\r\n\r\nAs they went thus, the son asking and the father answering, they\r\nencountered by chance a company of pretty and well-dressed young\r\nwomen, coming from a wedding, whom as soon as the young man saw, he\r\nasked his father what manner of things these were. \"My son,\" answered\r\nFilippo, \"cast your eyes on the ground and look not at them, for that\r\nthey are an ill thing.\" Quoth the son, \"And how are they called?\" The\r\nfather, not to awaken in the lad's mind a carnal appetite less than\r\nuseful, would not name them by the proper name, to wit, women, but\r\nsaid, \"They are called green geese.\" Whereupon, marvellous to relate,\r\nhe who have never seen a woman and who recked not of palaces nor oxen\r\nnor horses nor asses nor monies nor of aught else he had seen, said\r\nsuddenly, \"Father mine, I prithee get me one of these green geese.\"\r\n\"Alack, my son,\" replied the father, \"hold they peace; I tell thee\r\nthey are an ill thing.\" \"How!\" asked the youth. \"Are ill things then\r\nmade after this fashion?\" and Filippo answered, \"Ay.\" Then said the\r\nson, \"I know not what you would say nor why these are an ill thing;\r\nfor my part, meseemeth I never yet saw aught goodly or pleasing as are\r\nthese. They are fairer than the painted angels you have shown me\r\nwhiles. For God's sake, an you reck of me, contrive that we may carry\r\none of yonder green geese back with us up yonder, and I will give it\r\nto eat.\" \"Nay,\" answered the father, \"I will not: thou knowest not\r\nwhereon they feed.\" And he understood incontinent that nature was\r\nstronger than his wit and repented him of having brought the youth to\r\nFlorence. But I will have it suffice me to have told this much of the\r\npresent story and return to those for whose behoof I have related it.\r\n\r\nSome, then, of my censurers say that I do ill, young ladies, in\r\nstudying overmuch to please you and that you please me overmuch. Which\r\nthings I do most openly confess, to wit, that you please me and that I\r\nstudy to please you, and I ask them if they marvel thereat,--considering\r\n(let be the having known the dulcet kisses and amorous embracements\r\nand delightsome couplings that are of you, most sweet ladies, often\r\ngotten) only my having seen and still seeing your dainty manners and\r\nlovesome beauty and sprightly grace and above all your womanly\r\ncourtesy,--whenas he who had been reared and bred on a wild and\r\nsolitary mountain and within the bounds of a little cell, without\r\nother company than his father, no sooner set eyes on you than you\r\nalone were desired of him, you alone sought, you alone followed with\r\nthe eagerness of passion. Will they, then, blame me, back bite me,\r\nrend me with their tongues if I, whose body Heaven created all apt to\r\nlove you, I, who from my childhood vowed my soul to you, feeling the\r\npotency of the light of your eyes and the sweetness of your honeyed\r\nwords and the flame enkindled by your piteous sighs,--if, I say, you\r\nplease me or if I study to please you, seeing that you over all else\r\npleased a hermitling, a lad without understanding, nay, rather, a wild\r\nanimal? Certes, it is only those, who, having neither sense nor\r\ncognizance of the pleasures and potency of natural affection, love you\r\nnot nor desire to be loved of you, that chide me thus; and of these I\r\nreck little.\r\n\r\nAs for those who go railing anent mine age, it would seem they know\r\nill that, for all the leek hath a white head, the tail thereof is\r\ngreen. But to these, laying aside pleasantry, I answer that never, no,\r\nnot to the extreme limit of my life, shall I repute it to myself for\r\nshame to seek to please those whom Guido Cavalcanti and Dante\r\nAlighieri, when already stricken in years, and Messer Cino da Pistoja,\r\nwhen a very old man, held in honour and whose approof was dear to\r\nthem. And were it not to depart from the wonted usance of discourse, I\r\nwould cite history in support and show it to be all full of stories of\r\nancient and noble men who in their ripest years have still above all\r\nstudied to please the ladies, the which an they know not, let them go\r\nlearn. That I should abide with the Muses on Parnassus, I confess to\r\nbe good counsel; but, since we can neither abide for ever with the\r\nMuses, nor they with us, it is nothing blameworthy if, whenas it\r\nchanceth a man is parted from them, he take delight in seeing that\r\nwhich is like unto them. The muses are women, and albeit women may not\r\navail to match with them, yet at first sight they have a semblance of\r\nthem; insomuch that, an they pleased me not for aught else, for this\r\nthey should please me; more by token that women have aforetime been to\r\nme the occasion of composing a thousand verses, whereas the Muses\r\nnever were to me the occasion of making any. They aided me, indeed,\r\nand showed me how to compose the verses in question; and peradventure,\r\nin the writing of these present things, all lowly though they be, they\r\nhave come whiles to abide with me, in token maybe and honour of the\r\nlikeness that women bear to them; wherefore, in inditing these toys, I\r\nstray not so far from Mount Parnassus nor from the Muses as many\r\nbelike conceive.\r\n\r\nBut what shall we say to those who have such compassion on my hunger\r\nthat they counsel me provide myself bread? Certes, I know not, save\r\nthat, whenas I seek to imagine in myself what would be their answer,\r\nan I should of necessity beseech them thereof, to wit, of bread,\r\nmethinketh they would reply, \"Go seek it among thy fables.\" Indeed,\r\naforetime poets have found more thereof among their fables than many a\r\nrich man among his treasures, and many, following after their fables,\r\nhave caused their age to flourish; whereas, on the contrary, many, in\r\nseeking to have more bread than they needed, have perished miserably.\r\nWhat more [shall I say?] Let them drive me forth, whenas I ask it of\r\nthem, not that, Godamercy, I have yet need thereof; and even should\r\nneed betide, I know with the Apostle Paul both how to abound and\r\nsuffer need;[217] wherefore let none be more careful of me than I am\r\nof myself. For those who say that these things have not been such as I\r\nhave here set them down, I would fain have them produce the originals,\r\nand an these latter accord not with that of which I write, I will\r\nconfess their objection for just and will study to amend myself; but\r\ntill otherwhat than words appeareth, I will leave them to their\r\nopinion and follow mine own, saying of them that which they say of me.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: \"I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound;\r\neverywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be\r\nhungry, both to abound and suffer need.\"--_Philippians_ iv. 12.]\r\n\r\nWherefore, deeming that for the nonce I have answered enough, I say\r\nthat, armed, as I hope to be, with God's aid and yours, gentlest\r\nladies, and with fair patience, I will fare on with this that I have\r\nbegun, turning my back to the wind aforesaid and letting it blow, for\r\nthat I see not that aught can betide me other than that which betideth\r\nthin dust, the which a whirlwind, whenas it bloweth, either stirreth\r\nnot from the earth, or, an it stir it, carrieth it aloft and leaveth\r\nit oftentimes upon the heads of men and upon the crowns of kings and\r\nemperors, nay, bytimes upon high palaces and lofty towers, whence an\r\nit fall, it cannot go lower than the place wherefrom it was uplifted.\r\nAnd if ever with all my might I vowed myself to seek to please you in\r\naught, now more than ever shall I address myself thereto; for that I\r\nknow none can with reason say otherwhat than that I and others who\r\nlove you do according to nature, whose laws to seek to gainstand\r\ndemandeth overgreat strength, and oftentimes not only in vain, but to\r\nthe exceeding hurt of whoso striveth to that end, is this strength\r\nemployed. Such strength I confess I have not nor ever desired in this\r\nto have; and an I had it, I had liefer lend it to others than use it\r\nfor myself. Wherefore, let the carpers be silent and an they avail not\r\nto warm themselves, let them live star-stricken[218] and abiding in\r\ntheir delights--or rather their corrupt appetites,--leave me to abide\r\nin mine for this brief life that is appointed me. But now, fair\r\nladies, for that we have strayed enough, needs must we return whence\r\nwe set out and ensue the ordinance commenced.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 218: _i.e._ benumbed (_assiderati_).]\r\n\r\nThe sun had already banished every star from the sky and had driven\r\nfrom the earth the humid vapours of the night, when Filostrato,\r\narising, caused all his company arise and with them betook himself to\r\nthe fair garden, where they all proceeded to disport themselves, and\r\nthe eating-hour come, they dined whereas they had supped on the\r\nforegoing evening. Then, after having slept, what time the sun was at\r\nits highest, they seated themselves, after the wonted fashion, hard by\r\nthe fair fountain, and Filostrato bade Fiammetta give beginning to the\r\nstory-telling; whereupon, without awaiting further commandment, she\r\nbegan with womanly grace as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Fourth]\r\n\r\n     TANCRED, PRINCE OF SALERNO, SLAYETH HIS DAUGHTER'S LOVER AND\r\n     SENDETH HER HIS HEART IN A BOWL OF GOLD; WHEREUPON, POURING\r\n     POISONED WATER OVER IT, SHE DRINKETH THEREOF AND DIETH\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Our king hath this day appointed us a woeful subject of discourse,\r\nconsidering that, whereas we came hither to make merry, needs must we\r\ntell of others' tears, the which may not be recounted without moving\r\nboth those who tell and those who hearken to compassion thereof. He\r\nhath mayhap done this somedele to temper the mirth of the foregoing\r\ndays; but, whatsoever may have moved him thereto, since it pertaineth\r\nnot to me to change his pleasure, I will relate a piteous chance, nay,\r\nan ill-fortuned and a worthy of your tears.\r\n\r\nTancred, Lord of Salerno, was a humane prince and benign enough of\r\nnature, (had he not in his old age imbrued his hands in lover's\r\nblood,) who in all the course of his life had but one daughter, and\r\nhappier had he been if he had none. She was of him as tenderly loved\r\nas ever daughter of father, and knowing not, by reason of this his\r\ntender love for her, how to part with her, he married her not till she\r\nhad long overpassed the age when she should have had a husband. At\r\nlast, he gave her to wife to a son of the Duke of Capua, with whom\r\nhaving abidden a little while, she was left a widow and returned to\r\nher father. Now she was most fair of form and favour, as ever was\r\nwoman, and young and sprightly and learned perchance more than is\r\nrequired of a lady. Abiding, then, with her father in all ease and\r\nluxury, like a great lady as she was, and seeing that, for the love he\r\nbore her, he recked little of marrying her again, nor did it seem to\r\nher a seemly thing to require him thereof, she bethought herself to\r\nseek, an it might be, to get her privily a worthy lover. She saw men\r\ngalore, gentle and simple, frequent her father's court, and\r\nconsidering the manners and fashions of many, a young serving-man of\r\nher father's, Guiscardo by name, a man of humble enough extraction,\r\nbut nobler of worth and manners than whatsoever other, pleased her\r\nover all and of him, seeing him often, she became in secret ardently\r\nenamoured, approving more and more his fashions every hour; whilst the\r\nyoung man, who was no dullard, perceiving her liking for him, received\r\nher into his heart, on such wise that his mind was thereby diverted\r\nfrom well nigh everything other than the love of her.\r\n\r\nEach, then, thus secretly tendering the other, the young lady, who\r\ndesired nothing so much as to foregather with him, but had no mind to\r\nmake any one a confidant of her passion, bethought herself of a rare\r\ndevice to apprize him of the means; to wit, she wrote him a letter,\r\nwherein she showed him how he should do to foregather with her on the\r\nensuing day, and placing it in the hollow of a cane, gave the letter\r\njestingly to Guiscardo, saying, 'Make thee a bellows thereof for thy\r\nserving-maid, wherewith she may blow up the fire to-night.' Guiscardo\r\ntook the cane and bethinking himself that she would not have given it\r\nhim nor spoken thus, without some cause, took his leave and returned\r\ntherewith to his lodging. There he examined the cane and seeing it to\r\nbe cleft, opened it and found therein the letter, which having read\r\nand well apprehended that which he had to do, he was the joyfullest\r\nman alive and set about taking order how he might go to her, according\r\nto the fashion appointed him of her.\r\n\r\nThere was, beside the prince's palace, a grotto hewn out of the rock\r\nand made in days long agone, and to this grotto some little light was\r\ngiven by a tunnel[219] by art wrought in the mountain, which latter,\r\nfor that the grotto was abandoned, was well nigh blocked at its mouth\r\nwith briers and weeds that had overgrown it. Into this grotto one\r\nmight go by a privy stair which was in one of the ground floor rooms\r\nof the lady's apartment in the palace and which was shut in by a very\r\nstrong door. This stair was so out of all folk's minds, for that it\r\nhad been unused from time immemorial, that well nigh none remembered\r\nit to be there; but Love, to whose eyes there is nothing so secret but\r\nit winneth, had recalled it to the memory of the enamoured lady, who,\r\nthat none should get wind of the matter, had laboured sore many days\r\nwith such tools as she might command, ere she could make shift to open\r\nthe door; then, going down alone thereby into the grotto and seeing\r\nthe tunnel, she sent to bid Guiscardo study to come to her thereby and\r\nacquainted him with the height which herseemed should be from the\r\nmouth thereof to the ground.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 219: Or airshaft (_spiraglio_).]\r\n\r\nTo this end Guiscardo promptly made ready a rope with certain knots\r\nand loops, whereby he might avail to descend and ascend, and donning a\r\nleathern suit, that might defend him from the briers, he on the\r\nensuing night repaired, without letting any know aught of the matter,\r\nto the mouth of the tunnel. There making one end of the rope fast to a\r\nstout tree-stump that had grown up in the mouth, he let himself down\r\nthereby into the grotto and there awaited the lady, who, on the\r\nmorrow, feigning a desire to sleep, dismissed her women and shut\r\nherself up alone in her chamber; then, opening the privy door, she\r\ndescended into the grotto, where she found Guiscardo. They greeted one\r\nanother with marvellous joy and betook themselves to her chamber,\r\nwhere they abode great part of the day in the utmost delight; and\r\nafter they had taken order together for the discreet conduct of their\r\nloves, so they might abide secret, Guiscardo returned to the grotto,\r\nwhilst she shut the privy door and went forth to her women. The night\r\ncome, Guiscardo climbed up by his rope to the mouth of the tunnel and\r\nissuing forth whence he had entered in, returned to his lodging; and\r\nhaving learned this road, he in process of time returned many times\r\nthereafter.\r\n\r\nBut fortune, jealous of so long and so great a delight, with a woeful\r\nchance changed the gladness of the two lovers into mourning and\r\nsorrow; and it befell on this wise. Tancred was wont to come bytimes\r\nall alone into his daughter's chamber and there abide with her and\r\nconverse awhile and after go away. Accordingly, one day, after dinner,\r\nhe came thither, what time the lady (whose name was Ghismonda) was in\r\na garden of hers with all her women, and willing not to take her from\r\nher diversion, he entered her chamber, without being seen or heard of\r\nany. Finding the windows closed and the curtains let down over the\r\nbed, he sat down in a corner on a hassock at the bedfoot and leant his\r\nhead against the bed; then, drawing the curtain over himself, as if he\r\nhad studied to hide himself there, he fell asleep. As he slept thus,\r\nGhismonda, who, as ill chance would have it, had appointed her lover\r\nto come thither that day, softly entered the chamber, leaving her\r\nwomen in the garden, and having shut herself in, without perceiving\r\nthat there was some one there, opened the secret door to Guiscardo,\r\nwho awaited her. They straightway betook themselves to bed, as of\r\ntheir wont, and what while they sported and solaced themselves\r\ntogether, it befell that Tancred awoke and heard and saw that which\r\nGuiscardo and his daughter did; whereat beyond measure grieved, at\r\nfirst he would have cried out at them, but after bethought himself to\r\nkeep silence and abide, an he might, hidden, so with more secrecy and\r\nless shame to himself he might avail to do that which had already\r\noccurred to his mind.\r\n\r\nThe two lovers abode a great while together, according to their\r\nusance, without observing Tancred, and coming down from the bed,\r\nwhenas it seemed to them time, Guiscardo returned to the grotto and\r\nshe departed the chamber; whereupon Tancred, for all he was an old\r\nman, let himself down into the garden by a window and returned, unseen\r\nof any, to his own chamber, sorrowful unto death. That same night, at\r\nthe time of the first sleep, Guiscardo, by his orders, was seized by\r\ntwo men, as he came forth of the tunnel, and carried secretly, trussed\r\nas he was in his suit of leather, to Tancred, who, whenas he saw him,\r\nsaid, well nigh weeping, 'Guiscardo, my kindness to thee merited not\r\nthe outrage and the shame thou hast done me in mine own flesh and\r\nblood, as I have this day seen with my very eyes.' Whereto Guiscardo\r\nanswered nothing but this, 'Love can far more than either you or I.'\r\nTancred then commanded that he should be kept secretly under guard and\r\nin one of the chambers of the palace, and so was it done.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, having meanwhile revolved in himself many and divers\r\ndevices, he betook himself, after eating, as of his wont, to his\r\ndaughter's chamber and sending for the lady, who as yet knew nothing\r\nof these things, shut himself up with her and proceeded, with tears in\r\nhis eyes, to bespeak her thus: 'Ghismonda, meseemed I knew thy virtue\r\nand thine honesty, nor might it ever have occurred to my mind, though\r\nit were told me, had I not seen it with mine own eyes, that thou\r\nwouldst, even so much as in thought, have abandoned thyself to any\r\nman, except he were thy husband; wherefore in this scant remnant of\r\nlife that my eld reserveth unto me, I shall still abide sorrowful,\r\nremembering me of this. Would God, an thou must needs stoop to such\r\nwantonness, thou hadst taken a man sortable to thy quality! But,\r\namongst so many who frequent my court, thou hast chosen Guiscardo, a\r\nyouth of the meanest condition, reared in our court, well nigh of\r\ncharity, from a little child up to this day; wherefore thou hast put\r\nme in sore travail of mind, for that I know not what course to take\r\nwith thee. With Guiscardo, whom I caused take yesternight, as he\r\nissued forth of the tunnel and have in ward, I am already resolved how\r\nto deal; but with thee God knoweth I know not what to do. On one side\r\nlove draweth me, which I still borne thee more than father ever bore\r\ndaughter, and on the other most just despite, conceived for thine\r\nexceeding folly; the one would have me pardon thee, the other would\r\nhave me, against my nature, deal harshly by thee. But ere I come to a\r\ndecision, I would fain hear what thou hast to say to this.' So saying,\r\nhe bowed his head and wept sore as would a beaten child.\r\n\r\nGhismonda, hearing her father's words and seeing that not only was her\r\nsecret love discovered, but Guiscardo taken, felt an inexpressible\r\nchagrin and came many a time near upon showing it with outcry and\r\ntears, as women mostly do; nevertheless, her haughty soul\r\novermastering that weakness, with marvellous fortitude she composed\r\nher countenance and rather than proffer any prayer for herself,\r\ndetermined inwardly to abide no more on life, doubting not but her\r\nGuiscardo was already dead. Wherefore, not as a woman rebuked and\r\nwoeful for her default, but as one undaunted and valiant, with dry\r\neyes and face open and nowise troubled, she thus bespoke her father:\r\n'Tancred, I purpose neither to deny nor to entreat, for that the one\r\nwould profit me nothing nor would I have the other avail me; more by\r\ntoken that I am nowise minded to seek to render thy mansuetude and\r\nthine affection favourable to me, but rather, confessing the truth,\r\nfirst with true arguments to vindicate mine honour and after with\r\ndeeds right resolutely to ensue the greatness of my soul. True is it I\r\nhave loved and love Guiscardo, and what while I live, which will be\r\nlittle, I shall love him, nor, if folk live after death, shall I ever\r\nleave loving him; but unto this it was not so much my feminine frailty\r\nthat moved me as thy little solicitude to remarry me and his own\r\nworth.\r\n\r\nIt should have been manifest to thee, Tancred, being as thou art flesh\r\nand blood, that thou hadst begotten a daughter of flesh and blood and\r\nnot of iron or stone; and thou shouldst have remembered and should\r\nstill remember, for all thou art old, what and what like are the laws\r\nof youth and with what potency they work; nor, albeit thou, being a\r\nman, hast in thy best years exercised thyself in part in arms,\r\nshouldst thou the less know what ease and leisure and luxury can do in\r\nthe old, to say nothing of the young. I am, then, as being of thee\r\nbegotten, of flesh and blood and have lived so little that I am yet\r\nyoung and (for the one and the other reason) full of carnal desire,\r\nwhereunto the having aforetime, by reason of marriage, known what\r\npleasure it is to give accomplishment to such desire hath added\r\nmarvellous strength. Unable, therefore, to withstand the strength of\r\nmy desires, I addressed myself, being young and a woman, to ensue that\r\nwhereto they prompted me and became enamoured. And certes in this I\r\nset my every faculty to the endeavouring that, so far as in me lay, no\r\nshame should ensue either to thee or to me through this to which\r\nnatural frailty moved me. To this end compassionate Love and favouring\r\nFortune found and showed me a very occult way, whereby, unknown of\r\nany, I won to my desire, and this, whoever it be discovered it to\r\nthee or howsoever thou knowest it, I nowise deny.\r\n\r\nGuiscardo I took not at hazard, as many women do; nay, of deliberate\r\ncounsel I chose him before every other and with advisement prepense\r\ndrew him to me[220] and by dint of perseverance and discretion on my\r\npart and on his, I have long had enjoyment of my desire. Whereof it\r\nseemeth that thou, ensuing rather vulgar prejudice than truth,\r\nreproachest me with more bitterness than of having sinned by way of\r\nlove, saying (as if thou shouldst not have been chagrined, had I\r\nchosen therefor a man of gentle birth,) that I have committed myself\r\nwith a man of mean condition. Wherein thou seest not that thou blamest\r\nnot my default, but that of fortune, which too often advanceth the\r\nunworthy to high estate, leaving the worthiest alow.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 220: Lit. introduced him to me (_a me lo 'ntrodussi_); but\r\nBoccaccio here uses the word _introdurre_ in its rarer literal sense\r\nto lead, to draw, to bring in.]\r\n\r\nBut now let us leave this and look somewhat to the first principles of\r\nthings, whereby thou wilt see that we all get our flesh from one same\r\nstock and that all souls were by one same Creator created with equal\r\nfaculties, equal powers and equal virtues. Worth it was that first\r\ndistinguished between us, who were all and still are born equal;\r\nwherefore those who had and used the greatest sum thereof were called\r\nnoble and the rest abode not noble. And albeit contrary usance hath\r\nsince obscured this primary law, yet is it nowise done away nor\r\nblotted out from nature and good manners; wherefore he who doth\r\nworthily manifestly showeth himself a gentleman, and if any call him\r\notherwise, not he who is called, but he who calleth committeth\r\ndefault. Look among all thy gentlemen and examine into their worth,\r\ntheir usances and their manners, and on the other hand consider those\r\nof Guiscardo; if thou wilt consent to judge without animosity, thou\r\nwilt say that he is most noble and that these thy nobles are all\r\nchurls. With regard to his worth and virtue, I trusted not to the\r\njudgment of any other, but to that of thy words and of mine own eyes.\r\nWho ever so commended him as thou didst in all those praiseworthy\r\nthings wherefor a man of worth should be commended? And certes not\r\nwithout reason; for, if mine eyes deceived me not, there was no praise\r\ngiven him of thee which I saw him not justify by deeds, and that more\r\nadmirably than thy words availed to express; and even had I suffered\r\nany deceit in this, it is by thyself I should have been deceived. An,\r\nthen, thou say that I have committed myself with a man of mean\r\ncondition, thou sayst not sooth; but shouldst thou say with a poor\r\nman, it might peradventure be conceded thee, to thy shame who hast so\r\nill known to put a servant of thine and a man of worth in good case;\r\nyet poverty bereaveth not any of gentilesse; nay, rather, wealth it is\r\nthat doth this. Many kings, many great princes were once poor and many\r\nwho delve and tend sheep were once very rich.\r\n\r\nThe last doubt that thou broachest, to wit, what thou shouldst do with\r\nme, drive it away altogether; an thou in thine extreme old age be\r\ndisposed to do that which thou usedst not, being young, namely, to\r\ndeal cruelly, wreak thy cruelty upon me, who am minded to proffer no\r\nprayer unto thee, as being the prime cause of this sin, if sin it be;\r\nfor of this I certify thee, that whatsoever thou hast done or shalt do\r\nwith Guiscardo, an thou do not the like with me, mine own hands shall\r\ndo it. Now begone; go shed tears with women and waxing cruel, slay him\r\nand me with one same blow, an it seem to thee we have deserved it.'\r\n\r\nThe prince knew the greatness of his daughter's soul, but\r\nnotwithstanding believed her not altogether so firmly resolved as she\r\nsaid unto that which her words gave out. Wherefore, taking leave of\r\nher and having laid aside all intent of using rigour against her\r\nperson, he thought to cool her fervent love with other's suffering and\r\naccordingly bade Guiscardo's two guardians strangle him without noise\r\nthat same night and taking out his heart, bring it to him. They did\r\neven as it was commanded them, and on the morrow the prince let bring\r\na great and goodly bowl of gold and setting therein Guiscardo's heart,\r\ndespatched it to his daughter by the hands of a very privy servant of\r\nhis, bidding him say, whenas he gave it her, 'Thy father sendeth thee\r\nthis, to solace thee of the thing thou most lovest, even as thou hast\r\nsolaced him of that which he loved most.'\r\n\r\nNow Ghismonda, unmoved from her stern purpose, had, after her father's\r\ndeparture, let bring poisonous herbs and roots and distilled and\r\nreduced them in water, so she might have it at hand, an that she\r\nfeared should come to pass. The serving-man coming to her with the\r\nprince's present and message, she took the cup with a steadfast\r\ncountenance and uncovered it. Whenas she saw the heart and\r\napprehended the words of the message, she was throughly certified that\r\nthis was Guiscardo's heart and turning her eyes upon the messenger,\r\nsaid to him, 'No sepulchre less of worth than one of gold had beseemed\r\na heart such as this; and in this my father hath done discreetly.' So\r\nsaying, she set the heart to her lips and kissing it, said, 'Still in\r\neverything and even to this extreme limit of my life have I found my\r\nfather's love most tender towards me; but now more than ever;\r\nwherefore do than render him on my part for so great a gift the last\r\nthanks I shall ever have to give him.'\r\n\r\nThen, bending down over the cup, which she held fast, she said,\r\nlooking upon the heart, 'Alack, sweetest harbourage of all my\r\npleasures, accursed be his cruelty who maketh me now to see thee with\r\nthe eyes of the body! Enough was it for me at all hours to behold thee\r\nwith those of the mind. Thou hast finished thy course and hast\r\nacquitted thyself on such wise as was vouchsafed thee of fortune; thou\r\nart come to the end whereunto each runneth; thou hast left the toils\r\nand miseries of the world, and of thy very enemy thou hast that\r\nsepulchre which thy worth hath merited. There lacked nought to thee to\r\nmake thy funeral rites complete save her tears whom in life thou so\r\nlovedst, the which that thou mightest have, God put it into the heart\r\nof my unnatural father to send thee to me and I will give them to\r\nthee, albeit I had purposed to die with dry eyes and visage undismayed\r\nof aught; and having given them to thee, I will without delay so do\r\nthat my soul, thou working it,[221] shall rejoin that soul which thou\r\nerst so dearly guardedst. And in what company could I betake me more\r\ncontentedly or with better assurance to the regions unknown than with\r\nit?[222] Certain am I that it abideth yet herewithin[223] and vieweth\r\nthe seats of its delights and mine and as that which I am assured\r\nstill loveth me, awaiteth my soul, whereof it is over all beloved.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 221: _i.e._ thou being the means of bringing about the\r\nconjunction (_adoperandol tu_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 222: _i.e._ Guiscardo's soul.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 223: _i.e._ in the heart.]\r\n\r\nSo saying, no otherwise than as she had a fountain of water in her\r\nhead, bowing herself over the bowl, without making any womanly outcry,\r\nshe began, lamenting, to shed so many and such tears that they were a\r\nmarvel to behold, kissing the dead heart the while an infinite number\r\nof times. Her women, who stood about her, understood not what this\r\nheart was nor what her words meant, but, overcome with compassion,\r\nwept all and in vain questioned her affectionately of the cause of her\r\nlament and studied yet more, as best they knew and might, to comfort\r\nher. The lady, having wept as much as herseemed fit, raised her head\r\nand drying her eyes, said, 'O much-loved heart, I have accomplished\r\nmine every office towards thee, nor is there left me aught else to do\r\nsave to come with my soul and bear thine company.' So saying, she\r\ncalled for the vial wherein was the water she had made the day before\r\nand poured the latter into the bowl where was the heart bathed with so\r\nmany of her tears; then, setting her mouth thereto without any fear,\r\nshe drank it all off and having drunken, mounted, with the cup in her\r\nhand, upon the bed, where composing her body as most decently she\r\nmight, she pressed her dead lover's heart to her own and without\r\nsaying aught, awaited death.\r\n\r\nHer women, seeing and hearing all this, albeit they knew not what\r\nwater this was she had drunken, had sent to tell Tancred everything,\r\nand he, fearing that which came to pass, came quickly down into his\r\ndaughter's chamber, where he arrived what time she laid herself on her\r\nbed and addressed himself too late to comfort her with soft words;\r\nbut, seeing the extremity wherein she was, he fell a-weeping\r\ngrievously; whereupon quoth the lady to him, 'Tancred, keep these\r\ntears against a less desired fate than this of mine and give them not\r\nto me, who desire them not. Who ever saw any, other than thou, lament\r\nfor that which he himself hath willed? Nevertheless, if aught yet live\r\nin thee of the love which once thou borest me, vouchsafe me for a last\r\nboon that, since it was not thy pleasure that I should privily and in\r\nsecret live with Guiscardo, my body may openly abide with his,\r\nwhereassoever thou hast caused cast him dead.' The agony of his grief\r\nsuffered not the prince to reply; whereupon the young lady, feeling\r\nherself come to her end, strained the dead heart to her breast and\r\nsaid, 'Abide ye with God, for I go hence.' Then, closing her eyes and\r\nlosing every sense, she departed this life of woe. Such, then, as you\r\nhave heard, was the sorrowful ending of the loves of Guiscardo and\r\nGhismonda, whose bodies Tancred, after much lamentation, too late\r\nrepenting him of his cruelty, caused honourably bury in one same\r\nsepulchre, amid the general mourning of all the people of Salerno.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Fourth]\r\n\r\n     FRA ALBERTO GIVETH A LADY TO BELIEVE THAT THE ANGEL GABRIEL\r\n     IS ENAMOURED OF HER AND IN HIS SHAPE LIETH WITH HER SUNDRY\r\n     TIMES; AFTER WHICH, FOR FEAR OF HER KINSMEN, HE CASTETH\r\n     HIMSELF FORTH OF HER WINDOW INTO THE CANAL AND TAKETH REFUGE\r\n     IN THE HOUSE OF A POOR MAN, WHO ON THE MORROW CARRIETH HIM,\r\n     IN THE GUISE OF A WILD MAN OF THE WOODS, TO THE PIAZZA,\r\n     WHERE, BEING RECOGNIZED, HE IS TAKEN BY HIS BRETHREN AND PUT\r\n     IN PRISON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story told by Fiammetta had more than once brought the tears to\r\nthe eyes of the ladies her companions; but, it being now finished, the\r\nking with a stern countenance said, \"My life would seem to me a little\r\nprice to give for half the delight that Guiscardo had with Ghismonda,\r\nnor should any of you ladies marvel thereat, seeing that every hour of\r\nmy life I suffer a thousand deaths, nor for all that is a single\r\nparticle of delight vouchsafed me. But, leaving be my affairs for the\r\npresent, it is my pleasure that Pampinea follow on the order of the\r\ndiscourse with some story of woeful chances and fortunes in part like\r\nto mine own; which if she ensue like as Fiammetta hath begun, I shall\r\ndoubtless begin to feel some dew fallen upon my fire.\" Pampinea,\r\nhearing the order laid upon her, more by her affection apprehended the\r\nmind of the ladies her companions than that of Filostrato by his\r\nwords,[224] wherefore, being more disposed to give them some diversion\r\nthan to content the king, farther than in the mere letter of his\r\ncommandment, she bethought herself to tell a story, that should,\r\nwithout departing from the proposed theme, give occasion for laughter,\r\nand accordingly began as follows:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 224: _i.e._ was more inclined to consider the wishes of the\r\nladies her companions, which she divined by sympathy, than those of\r\nFilostrato, as shown by his words (_più per la sua affezione cognobbe\r\nl'animo delle campagne che quello del re per le sue parole_). It is\r\ndifficult, however, in this instance as in many others, to discover\r\nwith certainty Boccaccio's exact meaning, owing to his affectation of\r\nCiceronian concision and delight in obscure elliptical forms of\r\nconstruction; whilst his use of words in a remote or unfamiliar sense\r\nand the impossibility of deciding, in certain cases, the person of the\r\npronouns and adjectives employed tend still farther to darken counsel.\r\n_E.g._, if we render _affezione_ sentiment, _cognobbe_ (as\r\n_riconobbe_) acknowledged, recognized, and read _le sue parole_ as\r\nmeaning _her_ (instead of _his_) words, the whole sense of the passage\r\nis changed, and we must read it \"more by her sentiment (_i.e._ by the\r\ntendency and spirit of her story) recognized the inclination of her\r\ncompanions than that of the king by her [actual] words.\" I have\r\ncommented thus at large on this passage, in order to give my readers\r\nsome idea of the difficulties which at every page beset the translator\r\nof the Decameron and which make Boccaccio perhaps the most troublesome\r\nof all authors to render into representative English.]\r\n\r\n\"The vulgar have a proverb to the effect that he who is naught and is\r\nheld good may do ill and it is not believed of him; the which\r\naffordeth me ample matter for discourse upon that which hath been\r\nproposed to me and at the same time to show what and how great is the\r\nhypocrisy of the clergy, who, with garments long and wide and faces\r\npaled by art and voices humble and meek to solicit the folk, but\r\nexceeding loud and fierce to rebuke in others their own vices, pretend\r\nthat themselves by taking and others by giving to them come to\r\nsalvation, and to boot, not as men who have, like ourselves, to\r\npurchase paradise, but as in a manner they were possessors and lords\r\nthereof, assign unto each who dieth, according to the sum of the\r\nmonies left them by him, a more or less excellent place there,\r\nstudying thus to deceive first themselves, an they believe as they\r\nsay, and after those who put faith for that matter in their words.\r\nAnent whom, were it permitted me to discover as much as it behoved, I\r\nwould quickly make clear to many simple folk that which they keep\r\nhidden under those huge wide gowns of theirs. But would God it might\r\nbetide them all of their cozening tricks, as it betided a certain\r\nminor friar, and he no youngling, but held one of the first\r\ncasuists[225] in Venice; of whom it especially pleaseth me to tell\r\nyou, so as peradventure somewhat to cheer your hearts, that are full\r\nof compassion for the death of Ghismonda, with laughter and pleasance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 225: Lit. of those who _was_ held of the greatest casuists\r\n(_di quelli che de' maggior cassesi era tenuto_). This is another very\r\nobscure passage. The meaning of the word _cassesi_ is unknown and we\r\ncan only guess it to be a dialectic (probably Venetian) corruption of\r\nthe word _casisti_ (casuists). The Giunta edition separates the word\r\nthus, _casse si_, making _si_ a mere corroborative prefix to _era_,\r\nbut I do not see how the alteration helps us, the word _casse_\r\n(chests, boxes) being apparently meaningless in this connection.]\r\n\r\nThere was, then, noble ladies, in Imola, a man of wicked and corrupt\r\nlife, who was called Berto della Massa and whose lewd fashions, being\r\nwell known of the Imolese, had brought him into such ill savour with\r\nthem that there was none in the town who would credit him, even when\r\nhe said sooth; wherefore, seeing that his shifts might no longer stand\r\nhim in stead there, he removed in desperation to Venice, the\r\nreceptacle of every kind of trash, thinking to find there new means of\r\ncarrying on his wicked practices. There, as if conscience-stricken for\r\nthe evil deeds done by him in the past, feigning himself overcome with\r\nthe utmost humility and waxing devouter than any man alive, he went\r\nand turned Minor Friar and styled himself Fra Alberta da Imola; in\r\nwhich habit he proceeded to lead, to all appearance, a very austere\r\nlife, greatly commending abstinence and mortification and never eating\r\nflesh nor drinking wine, whenas he had not thereof that which was to\r\nhis liking. In short, scarce was any ware of him when from a thief, a\r\npimp, a forger, a manslayer, he suddenly became a great preacher,\r\nwithout having for all that forsworn the vices aforesaid, whenas he\r\nmight secretly put them in practice. Moreover, becoming a priest, he\r\nwould still, whenas he celebrated mass at the altar, an he were seen\r\nof many, beweep our Saviour's passion, as one whom tears cost little,\r\nwhenas he willed it. Brief, what with his preachings and his tears, he\r\ncontrived on such wise to inveigle the Venetians that he was trustee\r\nand depository of well nigh every will made in the town and guardian\r\nof folk's monies, besides being confessor and counsellor of the most\r\npart of the men and women of the place; and doing thus, from wolf he\r\nwas become shepherd and the fame of his sanctity was far greater in\r\nthose parts than ever was that of St. Francis at Assisi.\r\n\r\nIt chanced one day that a vain simple young lady, by name Madam\r\nLisetta da Ca[226] Quirino, wife of a great merchant who was gone with\r\nthe galleys into Flanders, came with other ladies to confess to this\r\nsame holy friar, at whose feet kneeling and having, like a true\r\ndaughter of Venice as she was (where the women are all feather-brained),\r\ntold him part of her affairs, she was asked of him if she had a lover.\r\nWhereto she answered, with an offended air, 'Good lack, sir friar,\r\nhave you no eyes in your head? Seem my charms to you such as those of\r\nyonder others? I might have lovers and to spare, an I would; but my\r\nbeauties are not for this one nor that. How many women do you see\r\nwhose charms are such as mine, who would be fair in Paradise?' Brief,\r\nshe said so many things of this beauty of hers that it was a weariness\r\nto hear. Fra Alberto incontinent perceived that she savoured of folly\r\nand himseeming she was a fit soil for his tools, he fell suddenly and\r\nbeyond measure in love with her; but, reserving blandishments for a\r\nmore convenient season, he proceeded, for the nonce, so he might show\r\nhimself a holy man, to rebuke her and tell her that this was vainglory\r\nand so forth. The lady told him he was an ass and knew not what one\r\nbeauty was more than another, whereupon he, unwilling to vex her\r\novermuch, took her confession and let her go away with the others.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 226: Venetian contraction of _Casa_, house. Da Ca Quirino,\r\nof the Quirino house or family.]\r\n\r\nHe let some days pass, then, taking with him a trusty companion of\r\nhis, he repaired to Madam Lisetta's house and withdrawing with her\r\ninto a room apart, where none might see him, he fell on his knees\r\nbefore her and said, 'Madam, I pray you for God's sake pardon me that\r\nwhich I said to you last Sunday, whenas you bespoke me of your beauty,\r\nfor that the following night I was so cruelly chastised there that I\r\nhave not since been able to rise from my bed till to-day.' Quoth\r\nMistress Featherbrain, 'And who chastised you thus?' 'I will tell\r\nyou,' replied the monk. 'Being that night at my orisons, as I still\r\nuse to be, I saw of a sudden a great light in my cell and ere I could\r\nturn me to see what it might be, I beheld over against me a very fair\r\nyouth with a stout cudgel in his hand, who took me by the gown and\r\ndragging me to my feet, gave me such a drubbing that he broke every\r\nbone in my body. I asked him why he used me thus and he answered, \"For\r\nthat thou presumedst to-day, to disparage the celestial charms of\r\nMadam Lisetta, whom I love over all things, save only God.\" \"Who,\r\nthen, are you?\" asked I; and he replied that he was the angel Gabriel.\r\n\"O my lord,\" said I, \"I pray you pardon me\"; and he, \"So be it; I\r\npardon thee on condition that thou go to her, as first thou mayst, and\r\nget her pardon; but if she pardons thee not, I will return to thee and\r\ngive thee such a bout of it that I will make thee a woeful man for\r\nall the time thou shalt live here below.\" That which he said to me\r\nafter I dare not tell you, except you first pardon me.'\r\n\r\nMy Lady Addlepate, who was somewhat scant of wit, was overjoyed to\r\nhear this, taking it all for gospel, and said, after a little, 'I told\r\nyou, Fra Alberto, that my charms were celestial, but, so God be mine\r\naid, it irketh me for you and I will pardon you forthright, so you may\r\ncome to no more harm, provided you tell me truly that which the angel\r\nsaid to you after.' 'Madam,' replied Fra Alberto, 'since you pardon\r\nme, I will gladly tell it you; but I must warn you of one thing, to\r\nwit, that whatever I tell you, you must have a care not to repeat it\r\nto any one alive, an you would not mar your affairs, for that you are\r\nthe luckiest lady in the world. The angel Gabriel bade me tell you\r\nthat you pleased him so much that he had many a time come to pass the\r\nnight with you, but that he feared to affright you. Now he sendeth to\r\ntell you by me that he hath a mind to come to you one night and abide\r\nawhile with you and (for that he is an angel and that, if he came in\r\nangel-form, you might not avail to touch him,) he purposeth, for your\r\ndelectation, to come in guise of a man, wherefore he biddeth you send\r\nto tell him when you would have him come and in whose form, and he\r\nwill come hither; whereof you may hold yourself blest over any other\r\nlady alive.'\r\n\r\nMy Lady Conceit answered that it liked her well that the angel Gabriel\r\nloved her, seeing she loved him well nor ever failed to light a candle\r\nof a groat before him, whereas she saw him depictured, and that what\r\ntime soever he chose to come to her, he should be dearly welcome and\r\nwould find her all alone in her chamber, but on this condition, that\r\nhe should not leave her for the Virgin Mary, whose great well-wisher\r\nit was said he was, as indeed appeareth, inasmuch as in every place\r\nwhere she saw him [limned], he was on his knees before her. Moreover,\r\nshe said it must rest with him to come in whatsoever form he pleased,\r\nso but she was not affrighted.\r\n\r\nThen said Fra Alberto, 'Madam, you speak sagely and I will without\r\nfail take order with him of that which you tell me. But you may do me\r\na great favour, which will cost you nothing; it is this, that you will\r\nhim come with this my body. And I will tell you in what you will do me\r\na favour; you must know that he will take my soul forth of my body and\r\nput it in Paradise, whilst he himself will enter into me; and what\r\nwhile he abideth with you, so long will my soul abide in Paradise.'\r\n'With all my heart,' answered Dame Littlewit. 'I will well that you\r\nhave this consolation, in requital of the buffets he gave you on my\r\naccount.' Then said Fra Alberto, 'Look that he find the door of your\r\nhouse open to-night, so he may come in thereat, for that, coming in\r\nhuman form, as he will, he might not enter save by the door.' The lady\r\nreplied that it should be done, whereupon the monk took his leave and\r\nshe abode in such a transport of exultation that her breech touched\r\nnot her shift and herseemed a thousand years till the angel Gabriel\r\nshould come to her.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Fra Alberto, bethinking him that it behoved him play the\r\ncavalier, not the angel, that night proceeded to fortify himself with\r\nconfections and other good things, so he might not lightly be\r\nunhorsed; then, getting leave, as soon as it was night, he repaired\r\nwith one of his comrades to the house of a woman, a friend of his,\r\nwhence he was used whiles to take his start what time he went to\r\ncourse the fillies; and thence, whenas it seemed to him time, having\r\ndisguised himself, he betook him to the lady's house. There he tricked\r\nhimself out as an angel with the trappings he had brought with him and\r\ngoing up, entered the chamber of the lady, who, seeing this creature\r\nall in white, fell on her knees before him. The angel blessed her and\r\nraising her to her feet, signed to her to go to bed, which she,\r\nstudious to obey, promptly did, and the angel after lay down with his\r\ndevotee. Now Fra Alberto was a personable man of his body and a lusty\r\nand excellent well set up on his legs; wherefore, finding himself in\r\nbed with Madam Lisetta, who was young and dainty, he showed himself\r\nanother guess bedfellow than her husband and many a time that night\r\ntook flight without wings, whereof she avowed herself exceeding\r\ncontent; and eke he told her many things of the glories of heaven.\r\nThen, the day drawing near, after taking order for his return, he made\r\noff with his trappings and returned to his comrade, whom the good\r\nwoman of the house had meanwhile borne amicable company, lest he\r\nshould get a fright, lying alone.\r\n\r\nAs for the lady, no sooner had she dined than, taking her\r\nwaiting-woman with her, she betook herself to Fra Alberto and gave him\r\nnews of the angel Gabriel, telling him that which she had heard from\r\nhim of the glories of life eternal and how he was made and adding to\r\nboot, marvellous stories of her own invention. 'Madam,' said he, 'I\r\nknow not how you fared with him; I only know that yesternight, whenas\r\nhe came to me and I did your message to him, he suddenly transported\r\nmy soul amongst such a multitude of roses and other flowers that never\r\nwas the like thereof seen here below, and I abode in one of the most\r\ndelightsome places that was aye until the morning; but what became of\r\nmy body meanwhile I know not.' 'Do I not tell you?' answered the lady.\r\n'Your body lay all night in mine arms with the angel Gabriel. If you\r\nbelieve me not, look under your left pap, whereas I gave the angel\r\nsuch a kiss that the marks of it will stay by you for some days to\r\ncome.' Quoth the friar, 'Say you so? Then will I do to-day a thing I\r\nhave not done this great while; I will strip myself, to see if you\r\ntell truth.' Then, after much prating, the lady returned home and Fra\r\nAlberto paid her many visits in angel-form, without suffering any\r\nhindrance.\r\n\r\nHowever, it chanced one day that Madam Lisetta, being in dispute with\r\na gossip of hers upon the question of female charms, to set her own\r\nabove all others, said, like a woman who had little wit in her noddle,\r\n'An you but knew whom my beauty pleaseth, in truth you would hold your\r\npeace of other women.' The other, longing to hear, said, as one who\r\nknew her well, 'Madam, maybe you say sooth; but knowing not who this\r\nmay be, one cannot turn about so lightly.' Thereupon quoth Lisetta,\r\nwho was eath enough to draw, 'Gossip, it must go no farther; but he I\r\nmean is the angel Gabriel, who loveth me more than himself, as the\r\nfairest lady (for that which he telleth me) who is in the world or the\r\nMaremma.'[227] The other had a mind to laugh, but contained herself,\r\nso she might make Lisetta speak farther, and said, 'Faith, madam, an\r\nthe angel Gabriel be your lover and tell you this, needs must it be\r\nso; but methought not the angels did these things.' 'Gossip,' answered\r\nthe lady, 'you are mistaken; zounds, he doth what you wot of better\r\nthan my husband and telleth me they do it also up yonder; but, for\r\nthat I seem to him fairer than any she in heaven, he hath fallen in\r\nlove with me and cometh full oft to lie with me; seestow now?'[228]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 227: _cf._ Artemus Ward's \"Natives of the Universe and other\r\nparts.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 228: _Mo vedi vu_, Venetian for _Or vedi tu_, now dost thou\r\nsee? I have rendered it by the equivalent old English form.]\r\n\r\nThe gossip, to whom it seemed a thousand years till she should be\r\nwhereas she might repeat these things, took her leave of Madam Lisetta\r\nand foregathering at an entertainment with a great company of ladies,\r\norderly recounted to them the whole story. They told it again to their\r\nhusbands and other ladies, and these to yet others, and so in less\r\nthan two days Venice was all full of it. Among others to whose ears\r\nthe thing came were Lisetta's brothers-in-law, who, without saying\r\naught to her, bethought themselves to find the angel in question and\r\nsee if he knew how to fly, and to this end they lay several nights in\r\nwait for him. As chance would have it, some inkling of the matter[229]\r\ncame to the ears of Fra Alberto, who accordingly repaired one night to\r\nthe lady's house, to reprove her, but hardly had he put off his\r\nclothes ere her brothers-in-law, who had seen him come, were at the\r\ndoor of her chamber to open it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 229: _i.e._ not of the trap laid for him by the lady's\r\nbrothers-in-law, but of her indiscretion in discovering the secret.]\r\n\r\nFra Alberto, hearing this and guessing what was to do, started up and\r\nhaving no other resource, opened a window, which gave upon the Grand\r\nCanal, and cast himself thence into the water. The canal was deep\r\nthere and he could swim well, so that he did himself no hurt, but made\r\nhis way to the opposite bank and hastily entering a house that stood\r\nopen there, besought a poor man, whom he found within, to save his\r\nlife for the love of God, telling him a tale of his own fashion, to\r\nexplain how he came there at that hour and naked. The good man was\r\nmoved to pity and it behoving him to go do his occasions, he put him\r\nin his own bed and bade him abide there against his return; then,\r\nlocking him in, he went about his affairs. Meanwhile, the lady's\r\nbrothers-in-law entered her chamber and found that the angel Gabriel\r\nhad flown, leaving his wings there; whereupon, seeing themselves\r\nbaffled, they gave her all manner hard words and ultimately made off\r\nto their own house with the angel's trappings, leaving her\r\ndisconsolate.\r\n\r\nBroad day come, the good man with whom Fra Alberto had taken refuge,\r\nbeing on the Rialto, heard how the angel Gabriel had gone that night\r\nto lie with Madam Lisetta and being surprised by her kinsmen, had cast\r\nhimself for fear into the canal, nor was it known what was come of\r\nhim, and concluded forthright that this was he whom he had at home.\r\nAccordingly, he returned thither and recognizing the monk, found means\r\nafter much parley, to make him fetch him fifty ducats, an he would not\r\nhave him give him up to the lady's kinsmen. Having gotten the money\r\nand Fra Alberto offering to depart thence, the good man said to him,\r\n'There is no way of escape for you, an it be not one that I will tell\r\nyou. We hold to-day a festival, wherein one bringeth a man clad\r\nbear-fashion and another one accoutred as a wild man of the woods and\r\nwhat not else, some one thing and some another, and there is a hunt\r\nheld in St. Mark's Place, which finished, the festival is at an end\r\nand after each goeth whither it pleaseth him with him whom he hath\r\nbrought. An you will have me lead you thither, after one or other of\r\nthese fashions, I can after carry you whither you please, ere it be\r\nspied out that you are here; else I know not how you are to get away,\r\nwithout being recognized, for the lady's kinsmen, concluding that you\r\nmust be somewhere hereabout, have set a watch for you on all sides.'\r\n\r\nHard as it seemed to Fra Alberto to go on such wise, nevertheless, of\r\nthe fear he had of the lady's kinsmen, he resigned himself thereto and\r\ntold his host whither he would be carried, leaving the manner to him.\r\nAccordingly, the other, having smeared him all over with honey and\r\ncovered him with down, clapped a chain about his neck and a mask on\r\nhis face; then giving him a great staff in on hand and in the other\r\ntwo great dogs which he had fetched from the shambles he despatched\r\none to the Rialto to make public proclamation that whoso would see the\r\nangel Gabriel should repair to St. Mark's Place; and this was Venetian\r\nloyalty! This done, after a while, he brought him forth and setting\r\nhim before himself, went holding him by the chain behind, to the no\r\nsmall clamour of the folk, who said all, 'What be this? What be\r\nthis?'[230] till he came to the place, where, what with those who had\r\nfollowed after them and those who, hearing the proclamation, were come\r\nthither from the Rialto, were folk without end. There he tied his wild\r\nman to a column in a raised and high place, making a show of awaiting\r\nthe hunt, whilst the flies and gads gave the monk exceeding annoy, for\r\nthat he was besmeared with honey. But, when he saw the place well\r\nfilled, making as he would unchain his wild man, he pulled off Fra\r\nAlberto's mask and said, 'Gentlemen, since the bear cometh not and\r\nthere is no hunt toward, I purpose, so you may not be come in vain,\r\nthat you shall see the angel Gabriel, who cometh down from heaven to\r\nearth anights, to comfort the Venetian ladies.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 230: _Che xe quel?_ Venetian for _che c'e quella cosa_, What\r\nis this thing?]\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the mask off than Fra Alberto was incontinent recognized\r\nof all, who raised a general outcry against him, giving him the\r\nscurviest words and the soundest rating was ever given a canting\r\nknave; moreover, they cast in his face, one this kind of filth and\r\nanother that, and so they baited him a great while, till the news came\r\nby chance to his brethren, whereupon half a dozen of them sallied\r\nforth and coming thither, unchained him and threw a gown over him;\r\nthen, with a general hue and cry behind them, they carried him off to\r\nthe convent, where it is believed he died in prison, after a wretched\r\nlife. Thus then did this fellow, held good and doing ill, without it\r\nbeing believed, dare to feign himself the angel Gabriel, and after\r\nbeing turned into a wild man of the woods and put to shame, as he\r\ndeserved, bewailed, when too late, the sins he had committed. God\r\ngrant it happen thus to all other knaves of his fashion!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Fourth]\r\n\r\n     THREE YOUNG MEN LOVE THREE SISTERS AND FLEE WITH THEM INTO\r\n     CRETE, WHERE THE ELDEST SISTER FOR JEALOUSY SLAYETH HER\r\n     LOVER. THE SECOND, YIELDING HERSELF TO THE DUKE OF CRETE,\r\n     SAVETH HER SISTER FROM DEATH, WHEREUPON HER OWN LOVER\r\n     SLAYETH HER AND FLEETH WITH THE ELDEST SISTER. MEANWHILE THE\r\n     THIRD LOVER AND THE YOUNGEST SISTER ARE ACCUSED OF THE NEW\r\n     MURDER AND BEING TAKEN, CONFESS IT; THEN, FOR FEAR OF DEATH,\r\n     THEY CORRUPT THEIR KEEPERS WITH MONEY AND FLEE TO RHODES,\r\n     WHERE THEY DIE IN POVERTY\r\n\r\n\r\nFilostrato, having heard the end of Pampinea's story, bethought\r\nhimself awhile and presently, turning to her, said, \"There was some\r\nlittle that was good and that pleased me in the ending of your story;\r\nbut there was overmuch before that which gave occasion for laughter\r\nand which I would not have had there.\" Then, turning to Lauretta,\r\n\"Lady,\" said he, \"ensue you with a better, and it may be.\" Quoth she,\r\nlaughing, \"You are too cruel towards lovers, an you desire of them\r\nonly an ill end;[231] but, to obey you, I will tell a story of three\r\nwho all ended equally ill, having had scant enjoyment of their loves.\"\r\nSo saying, she began thus: \"Young ladies, as you should manifestly\r\nknow, every vice may turn to the grievous hurt of whoso practiseth it,\r\nand often of other folk also; but of all others that which with the\r\nslackest rein carrieth us away to our peril, meseemeth is anger, which\r\nis none otherwhat than a sudden and unconsidered emotion, aroused by\r\nan affront suffered, and which, banishing all reason and overclouding\r\nthe eyes of the understanding with darkness, kindleth the soul to the\r\nhottest fury. And although this often cometh to pass in men and more\r\nin one than in another, yet hath it been seen aforetime to work\r\ngreater mischiefs in women, for that it is lightlier enkindled in\r\nthese latter and burneth in them with a fiercer flame and urgeth them\r\nwith less restraint. Nor is this to be marvelled at, for that, an we\r\nchoose to consider, we may see that fire, of its nature, catcheth\r\nquicklier to light and delicate things than to those which are denser\r\nand more ponderous; and we women, indeed,--let men not take it\r\nill,--are more delicately fashioned than they and far more mobile.\r\nWherefore, seeing that we are naturally inclined thereunto[232] and\r\nconsidering after how our mansuetude and our loving kindness are of\r\nrepose and pleasance to the men with whom we have to do and how big\r\nwith harm and peril are anger and fury, I purpose, to the intent that\r\nwe may with a more steadfast, mind keep ourselves from these latter,\r\nto show you by my story how the loves of three young men and as many\r\nladies came, as I said before, to an ill end, becoming through the ire\r\nof one of the latter, from happy most unhappy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 231: _i.e._ _semble_ \"an you would wish them nought but an\r\nill end.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 232: _i.e._ to anger.]\r\n\r\nMarseilles is, as you know, a very ancient and noble city, situate in\r\nProvence on the sea-shore, and was once more abounding in rich and\r\ngreat merchants than it is nowadays. Among the latter was one called\r\nNarnald Cluada, a man of mean extraction, but of renowned good faith\r\nand a loyal merchant, rich beyond measure in lands and monies, who had\r\nby a wife of his several children, whereof the three eldest were\r\ndaughters. Two of these latter, born at a birth, were fifteen and the\r\nthird fourteen years old, nor was aught awaited by their kinsfolk to\r\nmarry them but the return of Narnald, who was gone into Spain with his\r\nmerchandise. The names of the two elder were the one Ninetta and the\r\nother Maddalena and the third called Bertella. Of Ninetta a young man\r\nof gentle birth, though poor, called Restagnone, was enamoured as much\r\nas man might be, and she of him, and they had contrived to do on such\r\nwise that, without any knowing it, they had enjoyment of their loves.\r\n\r\nThey had already a pretty while enjoyed this satisfaction when it\r\nchanced that two young companions, named the one Folco and the other\r\nUghetto, whose fathers were dead, leaving them very rich, fell in\r\nlove, the one with Maddalena and the other with Bertella. Restagnone,\r\nnoting this (it having been shown him of Ninetta), bethought himself\r\nthat he might make shift to supply his own lack by means of the\r\nnewcomers' love. Accordingly, he clapped up an acquaintance with them,\r\nso that now one, now the other of them accompanied him to visit their\r\nmistresses and his; and when himseemed he was grown privy enough with\r\nthem and much their friend, he called them one day into his house and\r\nsaid to them, 'Dearest youths, our commerce should have certified you\r\nhow great is the love I bear you and that I would do for you that\r\nwhich I would do for myself; and for that I love you greatly, I\r\npurpose to discover to you that which hath occurred to my mind, and\r\nyou and I together will after take such counsel thereof as shall seem\r\nto you best. You, an your words lie not and for that to boot which\r\nmeseemeth I have apprehended by your deeds, both daily and nightly,\r\nburn with an exceeding passion for the two young ladies beloved of\r\nyou, as do I for the third their sister; and to this ardour, an you\r\nwill consent thereunto,[233] my heart giveth me to find a very sweet\r\nand pleasing remedy, the which is as follows. You are both very rich,\r\nwhich I am not; now, if you will agree to bring your riches into a\r\ncommon stock, making me a third sharer with you therein, and determine\r\nin which part of the world we shall go lead a merry life with our\r\nmistresses, my heart warranteth me I can without fail so do that the\r\nthree sisters, with a great part of their father's good, will go with,\r\nus whithersoever we shall please, and there, each with his wench, like\r\nthree brothers, we may live the happiest lives of any men in the\r\nworld. It resteth with you now to determine whether you will go about\r\nto solace yourself in this or leave it be.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 233: _i.e._ to the proposal I have to make.]\r\n\r\nThe two young men, who were beyond measure inflamed, hearing that they\r\nwere to have their lasses, were not long in making up their minds, but\r\nanswered that, so this[234] should ensue, they were ready to do as he\r\nsaid. Restagnone, having gotten this answer from the young men, found\r\nmeans a few days after to foregather with Ninetta, to whom he could\r\nnot come without great unease, and after he had abidden with her\r\nawhile, he told her what he had proposed to the others and with many\r\narguments studied to commend the emprise to her. This was little\r\nuneath to him, seeing that she was yet more desirous than himself to\r\nbe with him without suspect; wherefore she answered him frankly that\r\nit liked her well and that her sisters would do whatever she wished,\r\nespecially in this, and bade him make ready everything needful\r\ntherefor as quickliest he might. Restagnone accordingly returned to\r\nthe two young men, who still importuned him amain to do that whereof\r\nhe had bespoken them, and told them that, so far as concerned their\r\nmistresses, the matter was settled. Then, having determined among\r\nthemselves to go to Crete, they sold certain lands they had, under\r\ncolour of meaning to go a-trading with the price, and having made\r\nmoney of all their other goods, bought a light brigantine and secretly\r\nequipped it to the utmost advantage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 234: _i.e._ the possession of their mistresses.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Ninetta, who well enough knew her sisters' mind, with soft\r\nwords inflamed them with such a liking for the venture that themseemed\r\nthey might not live to see the thing accomplished. Accordingly, the\r\nnight come when they were to go aboard the brigantine, the three\r\nsisters opened a great coffer of their father's and taking thence a\r\nvast quantity of money and jewels, stole out of the house, according\r\nto the given order. They found their gallants awaiting them and going\r\nstraightway all aboard the brigantine, they thrust the oars into the\r\nwater and put out to sea nor rested till they came, on the following\r\nevening, to Genoa, where the new lovers for the first time took ease\r\nand joyance of their loves. There having refreshed themselves with\r\nthat whereof they had need, they set out again and sailing from port\r\nto port, came, ere it was the eighth day, without any hindrance, to\r\nCrete, where they bought great and goodly estates near Candia and made\r\nthem very handsome and delightsome dwelling-houses thereon. Here they\r\nfell to living like lords and passed their days in banquets and\r\njoyance and merrymaking, the happiest men in the world, they and their\r\nmistresses, with great plenty of servants and hounds and hawks and\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nAbiding on this wise, it befell (even as we see it happen all day long\r\nthat, how much soever things may please, they grow irksome, an one\r\nhave overgreat plenty thereof) that Restagnone, who had much loved\r\nNinetta, being now able to have her at his every pleasure, without let\r\nor hindrance, began to weary of her, and consequently his love for her\r\nbegan to wane. Having seen at entertainment a damsel of the country, a\r\nfair and noble young lady, who pleased him exceedingly, he fell to\r\ncourting her with all his might, giving marvellous entertainments in\r\nher honor and plying her with all manner gallantries; which Ninetta\r\ncoming to know, she fell into such a jealousy that he could not go a\r\nstep but she heard of it and after harassed both him and herself with\r\nwords and reproaches on account thereof. But, like as overabundance of\r\naught begetteth weariness, even so doth the denial of a thing desired\r\nredouble the appetite; accordingly, Ninetta's reproaches did but fan\r\nthe flame of Restagnone's new love and in process of time it came to\r\npass that, whether he had the favours of the lady he loved or not,\r\nNinetta held it for certain, whoever it was reported it to her;\r\nwherefore she fell into such a passion of grief and thence passed into\r\nsuch a fit of rage and despite that the love which she bore Restagnone\r\nwas changed to bitter hatred, and blinded by her wrath, she bethought\r\nherself to avenge, by his death, the affront which herseemed she had\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, betaking herself to an old Greek woman, a past mistress\r\nin the art of compounding poisons, she induced her with gifts and\r\npromises to make her a death-dealing water, which she, without\r\nconsidering farther, gave Restagnone one evening to drink he being\r\nheated and misdoubting him not thereof; and such was the potency of\r\nthe poison that, ere morning came, it had slain him. Folco and Ughetto\r\nand their mistresses, hearing of his death and knowing not of what\r\npoison he had died,[235] bewept him bitterly, together with Ninetta,\r\nand caused bury him honourably. But not many days after it chanced\r\nthat the old woman, who had compounded the poisoned water for Ninetta,\r\nwas taken for some other misdeed and being put to the torture,\r\nconfessed to this amongst her other crimes, fully declaring that which\r\nhad betided by reason thereof; whereupon the Duke of Crete, without\r\nsaying aught of the matter, beset Folco's palace by surprise one night\r\nand without any noise or gainsayal, carried off Ninetta prisoner, from\r\nwhom, without putting her to the torture, he readily got what he would\r\nknow of the death of Restagnone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 235: Sic (_di che veleno fosse morto_), but this is probably\r\na copyist's error for _che di veleno fosse morto_, _i.e._ that he had\r\ndied of poison.]\r\n\r\nFolco and Ughetto (and from them their ladies) had privy notice from\r\nthe duke why Ninetta had been taken, the which was exceeding grievous\r\nto them and they used their every endeavour to save her from the fire,\r\nwhereto they doubted not she would be condemned, as indeed she richly\r\ndeserved; but all seemed vain, for that the duke abode firm in willing\r\nto do justice upon her. However, Maddalena, who was a beautiful young\r\nwoman and had long been courted by the duke, but had never yet\r\nconsented to do aught that might pleasure him, thinking that, by\r\ncomplying with his wishes, she might avail to save her sister from the\r\nfire, signified to him by a trusty messenger that she was at his\r\ncommandment in everything, provided two things should ensue thereof,\r\nto wit, that she should have her sister again safe and sound and that\r\nthe thing should be secret. Her message pleased the duke, and after\r\nlong debate with himself if he should do as she proposed, he\r\nultimately agreed thereto and said that he was ready. Accordingly, one\r\nnight, having, with the lady's consent, caused detain Folco and\r\nUghetto, as he would fain examine them of the matter, he went secretly\r\nto couch with Maddalena and having first made a show of putting\r\nNinetta in a sack and of purposing to let sink her that night in the\r\nsea, he carried her with him to her sister, to whom on the morrow he\r\ndelivered her at parting, in payment of the night he had passed with\r\nher, praying her that this,[236] which had been the first of their\r\nloves, might not be the last and charging her send the guilty lady\r\naway, lest blame betide himself and it behove him anew proceed against\r\nher with rigour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 236: _i.e._ that night.]\r\n\r\nNext morning, Folco and Ughetto, having heard that Ninetta had been\r\nsacked overnight and believing it, were released and returned home to\r\ncomfort their mistresses for the death of their sister. However, for\r\nall Maddalena could do to hide her, Folco soon became aware of\r\nNinetta's presence in the palace, whereat he marvelled exceedingly and\r\nsuddenly waxing suspicious,--for that he had heard of the duke's\r\npassion for Maddalena,--asked the latter how her sister came to be\r\nthere. Maddalena began a long story, which she had devised to account\r\nto him therefor, but was little believed of her lover, who was shrewd\r\nand constrained her to confess the truth, which, after long parley,\r\nshe told him. Folco, overcome with chagrin and inflamed with rage,\r\npulled out a sword and slew her, whilst she in vain besought mercy;\r\nthen, fearing the wrath and justice of the duke, he left her dead in\r\nthe chamber and repairing whereas Ninetta was, said to her, with a\r\nfeigned air of cheerfulness, 'Quick, let us begone whither it hath\r\nbeen appointed of thy sister that I shall carry thee, so thou mayst\r\nnot fall again into the hands of the duke.' Ninetta, believing this\r\nand eager, in her fearfulness, to begone, set out with Folco, it being\r\nnow night, without seeking to take leave of her sister; whereupon he\r\nand she, with such monies (which were but few) as he could lay hands\r\non, betook themselves to the sea-shore and embarked on board a vessel;\r\nnor was it ever known whither they went.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, Maddalena being found murdered, there were some who, of\r\nthe envy and hatred they bore to Ughetto, forthright gave notice\r\nthereof to the duke, whereupon the latter, who loved Maddalena\r\nexceedingly, ran furiously to the house and seizing Ughetto and his\r\nlady, who as yet knew nothing of the matter,--to wit, of the departure\r\nof Folco and Ninetta,--constrained them to confess themselves guilty,\r\ntogether with Folco, of his mistress's death. They, apprehending with\r\nreason death in consequence of this confession, with great pains\r\ncorrupted those who had them in keeping, giving them a certain sum of\r\nmoney, which they kept hidden in their house against urgent\r\noccasions, and embarking with their guards, without having leisure to\r\ntake any of their goods, fled by night to Rhodes, where they lived no\r\ngreat while after in poverty and distress. To such a pass, then, did\r\nRestagnone's mad love and Ninetta's rage bring themselves and others.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Fourth]\r\n\r\n     GERBINO, AGAINST THE PLIGHTED FAITH OF HIS GRANDFATHER, KING\r\n     GUGLIELMO OF SICILY, ATTACKETH A SHIP OF THE KING OF TUNIS,\r\n     TO CARRY OFF A DAUGHTER OF HIS, WHO BEING PUT TO DEATH OF\r\n     THOSE ON BOARD, HE SLAYETH THESE LATTER AND IS AFTER HIMSELF\r\n     BEHEADED\r\n\r\n\r\nLauretta, having made an end of her story, was silent, whilst the\r\ncompany bewailed the illhap of the lovers, some blaming Ninetta's\r\nanger and one saying one thing and another another, till presently the\r\nking, raising his head, as if aroused from deep thought, signed to\r\nElisa to follow on; whereupon she began modestly, \"Charming ladies,\r\nthere are many who believe that Love launcheth his shafts only when\r\nenkindled of the eyes and make mock of those who hold that one may\r\nfall in love by hearsay; but that these are mistaken will very\r\nmanifestly appear in a story that I purpose to relate, wherein you\r\nwill see that report not only wrought this, without the lovers having\r\never set eyes on each other, but it will be made manifest to you that\r\nit brought both the one and the other to a miserable death.\r\n\r\nGuglielmo, the Second, King of Sicily, had (as the Sicilians pretend)\r\ntwo children, a son called Ruggieri and a daughter called Costanza.\r\nThe former, dying before his father, left a son named Gerbino, who was\r\ndiligently reared by his grandfather and became a very goodly youth\r\nand a renowned for prowess and courtesy. Nor did his fame abide\r\nconfined within the limits of Sicily, but, resounding in various parts\r\nof the world, was nowhere more glorious than in Barbary, which in\r\nthose days was tributary to the King of Sicily. Amongst the rest to\r\nwhose ears came the magnificent fame of Gerbino's valour and courtesy\r\nwas a daughter of the King of Tunis, who, according to the report of\r\nall who had seen her, was one of the fairest creatures ever fashioned\r\nby nature and the best bred and of a noble and great soul. She,\r\ndelighting to hear tell of men of valour, with such goodwill received\r\nthe tales recounted by one and another of the deeds valiantly done of\r\nGerbino and they so pleased her that, picturing to herself the\r\nprince's fashion, she became ardently enamoured of him and discoursed\r\nmore willingly of him than of any other and hearkened to whoso spoke\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the great renown of her beauty and worth had won to\r\nSicily, as elsewhither, and not without great delight nor in vain had\r\nit reached the ears of Gerbino; nay, it had inflamed him with love of\r\nher, no less than that which she herself had conceived for him.\r\nWherefore, desiring beyond measure to see her, against he should find\r\na colourable occasion of having his grandfather's leave to go to\r\nTunis, he charged his every friend who went thither to make known to\r\nher, as best he might, his secret and great love and bring him news of\r\nher. This was very dexterously done by one of them, who, under\r\npretence of carrying her women's trinkets to view, as do merchants,\r\nthroughly discovered Gerbino's passion to her and avouched the prince\r\nand all that was his to be at her commandment. The princess received\r\nthe messenger and the message with a glad flavour and answering that\r\nshe burnt with like love for the prince, sent him one of her most\r\nprecious jewels in token thereof. This Gerbino received with the\r\nutmost joy wherewith one can receive whatsoever precious thing and\r\nwrote to her once and again by the same messenger, sending her the\r\nmost costly gifts and holding certain treaties[237] with her, whereby\r\nthey should have seen and touched one another, had fortune but allowed\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 237: Or, in modern parlance, \"laying certain plans.\"]\r\n\r\nBut, things going thus and somewhat farther than was expedient, the\r\nyoung lady on the one hand and Gerbino on the other burning with\r\ndesire, it befell that the King of Tunis gave her in marriage to the\r\nKing of Granada, whereat she was beyond measure chagrined, bethinking\r\nherself that not only should she be separated from her lover by long\r\ndistance, but was like to be altogether parted from him; and had she\r\nseen a means thereto, she would gladly, so this might not betide, have\r\nfled from her father and betaken herself to Gerbino. Gerbino, in like\r\nmanner, hearing of this marriage, was beyond measure sorrowful\r\ntherefor and often bethought himself to take her by force, if it\r\nshould chance that she went to her husband by sea. The King of Tunis,\r\ngetting some inkling of Gerbino's love and purpose and fearing his\r\nvalour and prowess, sent to King Guglielmo, whenas the time came for\r\ndespatching her to Granada, advising him of that which he was minded\r\nto do and that, having assurance from him that he should not be\r\nhindered therein by Gerbino or others, he purposed to do it. The King\r\nof Sicily, who was an old man and had heard nothing of Gerbino's\r\npassion and consequently suspected not that it was for this that such\r\nan assurance was demanded, freely granted it and in token thereof,\r\nsent the King of Tunis a glove of his. The latter, having gotten the\r\ndesired assurance, caused equip a very great and goodly ship in the\r\nport of Carthage and furnish it with what was needful for those who\r\nwere to sail therein and having fitted and adorned it for the sending\r\nof his daughter into Granada, awaited nought but weather.\r\n\r\nThe young lady, who saw and knew all this, despatched one of her\r\nservants secretly to Palermo, bidding him salute the gallant Gerbino\r\non her part and tell him that she was to sail in a few days for\r\nGranada, wherefore it would now appear if he were as valiant a man as\r\nwas said and if he loved her as much as he had sundry times declared\r\nto her. Her messenger did his errand excellent well and returned to\r\nTunis, whilst Gerbino, hearing this and knowing that his grandfather\r\nhad given the King of Tunis assurance, knew not what to do. However,\r\nurged by love and that he might not appear a craven, he betook himself\r\nto Messina, where he hastily armed two light galleys and manning them\r\nwith men of approved valour, set sail with them for the coast of\r\nSardinia, looking for the lady's ship to pass there. Nor was he far\r\nout in his reckoning, for he had been there but a few days when the\r\nship hove in sight with a light wind not far from the place where he\r\nlay expecting it.\r\n\r\nGerbino, seeing this, said to his companions, 'Gentlemen, an you be\r\nthe men of mettle I take you for, methinketh there is none of you but\r\nhath either felt or feeleth love, without which, as I take it, no\r\nmortal can have aught of valour or worth in himself; and if you have\r\nbeen or are enamoured, it will be an easy thing to you to understand\r\nmy desire. I love and love hath moved me to give you this present\r\npains; and she whom I love is in the ship which you see becalmed\r\nyonder and which, beside that thing which I most desire, is full of\r\nvery great riches. These latter, an ye be men of valour, we may with\r\nlittle difficulty acquire, fighting manfully; of which victory I\r\ndesire nothing to my share save one sole lady, for whose love I have\r\ntaken up arms; everything else shall freely be yours. Come, then, and\r\nlet us right boldly assail the ship; God is favourable to our emprise\r\nand holdeth it here fast, without vouchsafing it a breeze.'\r\n\r\nThe gallant Gerbino had no need of many words, for that the Messinese,\r\nwho were with him being eager for plunder, were already disposed to do\r\nthat unto which he exhorted them. Wherefore, making a great outcry, at\r\nthe end of his speech, that it should be so, they sounded the trumpets\r\nand catching up their arms, thrust the oars into the water and made\r\nfor the Tunis ship. They who were aboard this latter, seeing the\r\ngalleys coming afar off and being unable to flee,[238] made ready for\r\ndefence. The gallant Gerbino accosting the ship, let command that the\r\nmasters thereof should be sent on board the galleys, an they had no\r\nmind to fight; but the Saracens, having certified themselves who they\r\nwere and what they sought, declared themselves attacked of them\r\nagainst the faith plighted them by King Guglielmo; in token whereof\r\nthey showed the latter's glove, and altogether refused to surrender\r\nthemselves, save for stress of battle, or to give them aught that was\r\nin the ship.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 238: _i.e._ for lack of wind.]\r\n\r\nGerbino, who saw the lady upon the poop, far fairer than he had\r\npictured her to himself, and was more inflamed than ever, replied to\r\nthe showing of the glove that there were no falcons there at that\r\npresent and consequently there needed no gloves; wherefore, an they\r\nchose not to give up the lady, they must prepare to receive battle.\r\nAccordingly, without further parley, they fell to casting shafts and\r\nstones at one another, and on this wise they fought a great while,\r\nwith loss on either side. At last, Gerbino, seeing that he did little\r\nto the purpose, took a little vessel he had brought with him out of\r\nSardinia and setting fire therein, thrust it with both the galleys\r\naboard the ship. The Saracens, seeing this and knowing that they must\r\nof necessity surrender or die, fetched the king's daughter, who wept\r\nbelow, on deck and brought her to the ship's prow; then, calling\r\nGerbino, they butchered her before his eyes, what while she called for\r\nmercy and succour, and cast her into the sea, saying, 'Take her; we\r\ngive her to thee, such as we may and such as thine unfaith hath\r\nmerited.'\r\n\r\nGerbino, seeing their barbarous deed, caused lay himself alongside the\r\nship and recking not of shaft or stone, boarded it, as if courting\r\ndeath, in spite of those who were therein; then,--even as a hungry\r\nlion, coming among a herd of oxen, slaughtereth now this, now that,\r\nand with teeth and claws sateth rather his fury than his\r\nhunger,--sword in hand, hewing now at one, now at another, he cruelly\r\nslew many of the Saracens; after which, the fire now waxing in the\r\nenkindled ship, he caused the sailors fetch thereout what they might,\r\nin payment of their pains, and descended thence, having gotten but a\r\nsorry victory over his adversaries. Then, letting take up the fair\r\nlady's body from the sea, long and with many tears he bewept it and\r\nsteering for Sicily, buried it honourably in Ustica, a little island\r\nover against Trapani; after which he returned home, the woefullest man\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nThe King of Tunis, hearing the heavy news, sent his ambassadors, clad\r\nall in black, to King Guglielmo, complaining of the ill observance of\r\nthe faith which he had plighted him. They recounted to him how the\r\nthing had passed, whereat King Guglielmo was sore incensed and seeing\r\nno way to deny them the justice they sought, caused take Gerbino; then\r\nhimself,--albeit there was none of his barons but strove with prayers\r\nto move him from his purpose,--condemned him to death and let strike\r\noff his head in his presence, choosing rather to abide without\r\nposterity than to be held a faithless king. Thus, then, as I have told\r\nyou, did these two lovers within a few days[239] die miserably a\r\nviolent death, without having tasted any fruit of their loves.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: _i.e._ of each other.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Fourth]\r\n\r\n     LISABETTA'S[240] BROTHERS SLAY HER LOVER, WHO APPEARETH TO\r\n     HER IN A DREAM AND SHOWETH HER WHERE HE IS BURIED, WHEREUPON\r\n     SHE PRIVILY DISINTERRETH HIS HEAD AND SETTETH IT IN A POT OF\r\n     BASIL.

Some texts of the Decameron call the\r\nheroine _Isabetta_, but in the heading only, all with which I am\r\nacquainted agreeing in the use of the form _Lisabetta_ in the body of\r\nthe story.]\r\n\r\n\r\nElisa's tale being ended and somedele commended of the king, Filomena\r\nwas bidden to discourse, who, full of compassion for the wretched\r\nGerbino and his mistress, after a piteous sigh, began thus: \"My story,\r\ngracious ladies, will not treat of folk of so high condition as were\r\nthose of whom Elisa hath told, yet peradventure it will be no less\r\npitiful; and what brought me in mind of it was the mention, a little\r\nbefore, of Messina, where the case befell.\r\n\r\nThere were then in Messina three young brothers, merchants and left\r\nvery rich by their father, who was a man of San Gimignano, and they\r\nhad an only sister, Lisabetta by name, a right fair and well-mannered\r\nmaiden, whom, whatever might have been the reason thereof, they had\r\nnot yet married. Now these brothers had in one of their warehouses a\r\nyouth of Pisa, called Lorenzo, who did and ordered all their affairs\r\nand was very comely and agreeable of person; wherefore, Lisabetta\r\nlooking sundry times upon him, it befell that he began strangely to\r\nplease her; of which Lorenzo taking note at one time and another, he\r\nin like manner, leaving his other loves, began to turn his thoughts to\r\nher; and so went the affair, that, each being alike pleasing to the\r\nother, it was no great while before, taking assurance, they did that\r\nwhich each of them most desired.\r\n\r\nContinuing on this wise and enjoying great pleasure and delight one of\r\nthe other, they knew not how to do so secretly but that, one night,\r\nLisabetta, going whereas Lorenzo lay, was, unknown to herself, seen of\r\nthe eldest of her brothers, who, being a prudent youth, for all the\r\nannoy it gave him to know this thing, being yet moved by more\r\nhonourable counsel, abode without sign or word till the morning,\r\nrevolving in himself various things anent the matter. The day being\r\ncome, he recounted to his brothers that which he had seen the past\r\nnight of Lisabetta and Lorenzo, and after long advisement with them,\r\ndetermined (so that neither to them nor to their sister should any\r\nreproach ensue thereof) to pass the thing over in silence and feign to\r\nhave seen and known nothing thereof till such time as, without hurt or\r\nunease to themselves, they might avail to do away this shame from\r\ntheir sight, ere it should go farther. In this mind abiding and\r\ndevising and laughing with Lorenzo as was their wont, it befell that\r\none day, feigning to go forth the city, all three, a-pleasuring, they\r\ncarried him with them to a very lonely and remote place; and there,\r\nthe occasion offering, they slew him, whilst he was off his guard, and\r\nburied him on such wise that none had knowledge of it; then, returning\r\nto Messina, they gave out that they had despatched him somewhither for\r\ntheir occasions, the which was the lightlier credited that they were\r\noften used to send him abroad about their business.\r\n\r\nLorenzo returning not and Lisabetta often and instantly questioning\r\nher brothers of him, as one to whom the long delay was grievous, it\r\nbefell one day, as she very urgently enquired of him, that one of them\r\nsaid to her, 'What meaneth this? What hast thou to do often of him? An\r\nthou question of him with Lorenzo, that thou askest thus more, we\r\nwill make thee such answer as thou deservest.' Wherefore the girl, sad\r\nand grieving and fearful she knew not of what, abode without more\r\nasking; yet many a time anights she piteously called him and prayed\r\nhim come to her, and whiles with many tears she complained of his long\r\ntarrying; and thus, without a moment's gladness, she abode expecting\r\nhim alway, till one night, having sore lamented Lorenzo for that he\r\nreturned not and being at last fallen asleep, weeping, he appeared to\r\nher in a dream, pale and all disordered, with clothes all rent and\r\nmouldered, and herseemed he bespoke her thus: 'Harkye, Lisabetta; thou\r\ndost nought but call upon me, grieving for my long delay and cruelly\r\nimpeaching me with thy tears. Know, therefore, that I may never more\r\nreturn to thee, for that, the last day thou sawest me, thy brothers\r\nslew me.' Then, having discovered to her the place where they had\r\nburied him, he charged her no more call him nor expect him and\r\ndisappeared; whereupon she awoke and giving faith to the vision, wept\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, being risen and daring not say aught to her brothers,\r\nshe determined to go to the place appointed and see if the thing were\r\ntrue, as it had appeared to her in the dream. Accordingly, having\r\nleave to go somedele without the city for her disport, she betook\r\nherself thither,[241] as quickliest she might, in company of one who\r\nhad been with them[242] otherwhiles and knew all her affairs; and\r\nthere, clearing away the dead leaves from the place, she dug whereas\r\nherseemed the earth was less hard. She had not dug long before she\r\nfound the body of her unhappy lover, yet nothing changed nor rotted,\r\nand thence knew manifestly that her vision was true, wherefore she was\r\nthe most distressful of women; yet, knowing that this was no place for\r\nlament, she would fain, an she but might, have borne away the whole\r\nbody, to give it fitter burial; but, seeing that this might not be,\r\nshe with a knife did off[243] the head from the body, as best she\r\ncould, and wrapping it in a napkin, laid it in her maid's lap. Then,\r\ncasting back the earth over the trunk, she departed thence, without\r\nbeing seen of any, and returned home, where, shutting herself in her\r\nchamber with her lover's head, she bewept it long and bitterly,\r\ninsomuch that she bathed it all with her tears, and kissed it a\r\nthousand times in every part. Then, taking a great and goodly pot, of\r\nthose wherein they plant marjoram or sweet basil, she set the head\r\ntherein, folded in a fair linen cloth, and covered it with earth, in\r\nwhich she planted sundry heads of right fair basil of Salerno; nor did\r\nshe ever water these with other water than that of her tears or rose\r\nor orange-flower water. Moreover she took wont to sit still near the\r\npot and to gaze amorously upon it with all her desire, as upon that\r\nwhich held her Lorenzo hid; and after she had a great while looked\r\nthereon, she would bend over it and fall to weeping so sore and so\r\nlong that her tears bathed all the basil, which, by dint of long and\r\nassiduous tending, as well as by reason of the fatness of the earth,\r\nproceeding from the rotting head that was therein, waxed passing fair\r\nand very sweet of savour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 241: _i.e._ to the place shown her in the dream.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 242: _i.e._ in their service.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 243: Lit. unhung (_spiccò_).]\r\n\r\nThe damsel, doing without cease after this wise, was sundry times seen\r\nof her neighbours, who to her brothers, marvelling at her waste beauty\r\nand that her eyes seemed to have fled forth her head [for weeping],\r\nrelated this, saying, 'We have noted that she doth every day after\r\nsuch a fashion.' The brothers, hearing and seeing this and having once\r\nand again reproved her therefor, but without avail, let secretly carry\r\naway from her the pot, which she, missing, with the utmost instance\r\nmany a time required, and for that it was not restored to her, stinted\r\nnot to weep and lament till she fell sick; nor in her sickness did she\r\nask aught other than the pot of basil. The young men marvelled greatly\r\nat this continual asking and bethought them therefor to see what was\r\nin this pot. Accordingly, turning out the earth, they found the cloth\r\nand therein the head, not yet so rotted but they might know it, by the\r\ncurled hair, to be that of Lorenzo. At this they were mightily amazed\r\nand feared lest the thing should get wind; wherefore, burying the\r\nhead, without word said, they privily departed Messina, having taken\r\norder how they should withdraw thence, and betook themselves to\r\nNaples. The damsel, ceasing never from lamenting and still demanding\r\nher pot, died, weeping; and so her ill-fortuned love had end. But,\r\nafter a while the thing being grown manifest unto many, there was one\r\nwho made thereon the song that is yet sung, to wit:\r\n\r\n     Alack! ah, who can the ill Christian be,\r\n       That stole my pot away?\" etc.[244]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 244: The following is a translation of the whole of the song\r\nin question, as printed, from a MS. in the Medicean Library, in\r\nFanfani's edition of the Decameron.\r\n\r\nAlack! ah, who can the ill Christian be,\r\n  That stole my pot away,\r\nMy pot of basil of Salern, from me?\r\n  'Twas thriv'n with many a spray\r\nAnd I with mine own hand did plant the tree,\r\n  Even on the festal[A] day.\r\n'Tis felony to waste another's ware.\r\n\r\n'Tis felony to waste another's ware;\r\n  Yea, and right grievous sin.\r\nAnd I, poor lass, that sowed myself whilere\r\n  A pot with flowers therein,\r\nSlept in its shade, so great it was and fair;\r\n  But folk, that envious bin,\r\nStole it away even from my very door.\r\n\r\n'Twas stolen away even from my very door.\r\n  Full heavy was my cheer,\r\n(Ah, luckless maid, would I had died tofore!)\r\n  Who brought[B] it passing dear,\r\nYet kept ill ward thereon one day of fear.\r\n  For him I loved so sore,\r\nI planted it with marjoram about.\r\n\r\nI planted it with marjoram about,\r\n  When May was blithe and new;\r\nYea, thrice I watered it, week in, week out,\r\n  And watched how well it grew:\r\nBut now, for sure, away from me 'tis ta'en.\r\n\r\nAy, now, for sure, away from me 'tis ta'en;\r\n  I may 't no longer hide.\r\nHad I but known (alas, regret is vain!)\r\n  That which should me betide,\r\nBefore my door on guard I would have lain\r\n  To sleep, my flowers beside.\r\nYet might the Great God ease me at His will.\r\n\r\nYea, God Most High might ease me, at His will,\r\n  If but it liked Him well,\r\nOf him who wrought me such unright and ill;\r\n  He into pangs of hell\r\nCast me who stole my basil-pot, that still\r\n  Was full of such sweet smell,\r\nIts savour did all dole from me away.\r\n\r\nAll dole its savour did from me away;\r\n  It was so redolent,\r\nWhen, with the risen sun, at early day\r\n  To water it I went,\r\nThe folk would marvel all at it and say,\r\n  \"Whence comes the sweetest scent?\"\r\nAnd I for love of it shall surely die.\r\n\r\nYea, I for love of it shall surely die,\r\n  For love and grief and pain.\r\nIf one would tell me where it is, I'd buy\r\n  It willingly again.\r\nFivescore gold crowns, that in my pouch have I,\r\n  I'd proffer him full fain,\r\nAnd eke a kiss, if so it liked the swain.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Quære--natal?--perhaps meaning her birthday (_lo giorno\r\ndella festa_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: Or \"purchased\" in the old sense of obtained, acquired\r\n(_accattai_).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Fourth]\r\n\r\n     ANDREVUOLA LOVETH GABRIOTTO AND RECOUNTETH TO HIM A DREAM\r\n     SHE HATH HAD, WHEREUPON HE TELLETH HER ONE OF HIS OWN AND\r\n     PRESENTLY DIETH SUDDENLY IN HER ARMS.

But the king, having heard the end\r\nthereof, charged Pamfilo follow on the ordinance; whereupon quoth he,\r\n\"The dream in the foregoing story giveth me occasion to recount one\r\nwherein is made mention of two dreams, which were of a thing to come,\r\neven as the former was of a thing [already] betided, and scarce were\r\nthey finished telling by those who had dreamt them than the\r\naccomplishment followed of both. You must know, then, lovesome ladies,\r\nthat it is an affection common to all alive to see various things in\r\nsleep, whereof,--albeit to the sleeper, what while he sleepeth, they\r\nall appear most true and he, awakened, accounteth some true, others\r\nprobable and yet others out of all likelihood,--many are natheless\r\nfound to be come to pass. By reason whereof many lend to every dream\r\nas much belief as they would to things they should see, waking, and\r\nfor their proper dreams they sorrow or rejoice, according as by these\r\nthey hope or fear. And contrariwise, there are those who believe none\r\nthereof, save after they find themselves fallen into the peril\r\nforeshown. Of these,[245] I approve neither the one nor other, for\r\nthat dreams are neither always true nor always false. That they are\r\nnot all true, each one of us must often enough have had occasion to\r\nknow; and that they are not all false hath been already shown in\r\nFilomena her story, and I also purpose, as I said before, to show it\r\nin mine. Wherefore I am of opinion that, in the matter of living and\r\ndoing virtuously, one should have no fear of any dream contrary\r\nthereto nor forego good intentions by reason thereof; as for perverse\r\nand wicked things, on the other hand, however favourable dreams may\r\nappear thereto and how much soever they may hearten him who seeth them\r\nwith propitious auguries, none of them should be credited, whilst full\r\nfaith should be accorded unto all that tend to the contrary.[246] But\r\nto come to the story.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 245: _i.e._ these two classes of folk.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 246: _i.e._ to the encouragement of good and virtuous\r\nactions and purposes.]\r\n\r\nThere was once in the city of Brescia a gentleman called Messer Negro\r\nda Ponte Carraro, who amongst sundry other children had a daughter\r\nnamed Andrevuola, young and unmarried and very fair. It chanced she\r\nfell in love with a neighbour of hers, Gabriotto by name, a man of\r\nmean condition, but full laudable fashions and comely and pleasant of\r\nhis person, and by the means and with the aid of the serving-maid of\r\nthe house, she so wrought that not only did Gabriotto know himself\r\nbeloved of her, but was many and many a time brought, to the delight\r\nof both parties, into a goodly garden of her father's. And in order\r\nthat no cause, other than death, should ever avail to sever those\r\ntheir delightsome loves, they became in secret husband and wife, and\r\nso stealthily continuing their foregatherings, it befell that the\r\nyoung lady, being one night asleep, dreamt that she was in her garden\r\nwith Gabriotto and held him in her arms, to the exceeding pleasure of\r\neach; but, as they abode thus, herseemed she saw come forth of his\r\nbody something dark and frightful, the form whereof she could not\r\ndiscern; the which took Gabriotto and tearing him in her despite with\r\nmarvellous might from her embrace, made off with him underground, nor\r\never more might she avail to see either the one or the other.\r\n\r\nAt this she fell into an inexpressible passion of grief, whereby she\r\nawoke, and albeit, awaking, she was rejoiced to find that it was not\r\nas she had dreamed, nevertheless fear entered into her by reason of\r\nthe dream she had seen. Wherefore, Gabriotto presently desiring to\r\nvisit her that next night, she studied as most she might to prevent\r\nhis coming; however, seeing his desire and so he might not misdoubt\r\nhim of otherwhat, she received him in the garden and having gathered\r\ngreat store of roses, white and red (for that it was the season), she\r\nwent to sit with him at the foot of a very goodly and clear fountain\r\nthat was there. After they had taken great and long delight together,\r\nGabriotto asked her why she would have forbidden his coming that\r\nnight; whereupon she told him, recounting to him the dream she had\r\nseen the foregoing night and the fear she had gotten therefrom.\r\n\r\nHe, hearing this, laughed it to scorn and said that it was great folly\r\nto put any faith in dreams, for that they arose of excess of food or\r\nlack thereof and were daily seen to be all vain, adding, 'Were I\r\nminded to follow after dreams, I had not come hither, not so much on\r\naccount of this of thine as of one I myself dreamt last night; which\r\nwas that meseemed I was in a fair and delightsome wood, wherein I went\r\nhunting and had taken the fairest and loveliest hind was ever seen;\r\nfor methought she was whiter than snow and was in brief space become\r\nso familiar with me that she never left me a moment. Moreover,\r\nmeseemed I held her so dear that, so she might not depart from me, I\r\nhad put a collar of gold about her neck and held her in hand with a\r\ngolden chain. After this medreamed that, once upon a time, what while\r\nthis hind lay couched with its head in my bosom,[247] there issued I\r\nknow not whence a greyhound bitch as black as coal, anhungred and\r\npassing gruesome of aspect, and made towards me. Methought I offered\r\nit no resistance, wherefore meseemed it thrust its muzzle into my\r\nbreast on the left side and gnawed thereat till it won to my heart,\r\nwhich methought it tore from me, to carry it away. Therewith I felt\r\nsuch a pain that my sleep was broken and awaking, I straightway\r\nclapped my hand to my side, to see if I had aught there; but, finding\r\nnothing amiss with me, I made mock of myself for having sought. But,\r\nafter all, what booteth this dream?[248] I have dreamed many such and\r\nfar more frightful, nor hath aught in the world befallen me by reason\r\nthereof; wherefore let it pass and let us think to give ourselves a\r\ngood time.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 247: Or \"lap\" (_seno_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 248: Lit. what meaneth this? (_che vuol dire questo?_)]\r\n\r\nThe young lady, already sore adread for her own dream, hearing this,\r\nwaxed yet more so, but hid her fear, as most she might, not to be the\r\noccasion of any unease to Gabriotto. Nevertheless, what while she\r\nsolaced herself with him, clipping and kissing him again and again and\r\nbeing of him clipped and kissed, she many a time eyed him in the face\r\nmore than of her wont, misdoubting she knew not what, and whiles she\r\nlooked about the garden, and she should see aught of black come\r\nanywhence. Presently, as they abode thus, Gabriotto heaved a great\r\nsigh and embracing her said, 'Alas, my soul, help me, for I die!' So\r\nsaying, he fell to the ground upon the grass of the lawn. The young\r\nlady, seeing this, drew him up into her lap and said, well nigh\r\nweeping, 'Alack, sweet my lord, what aileth thee?' He answered not,\r\nbut, panting sore and sweating all over, no great while after departed\r\nthis life.\r\n\r\nHow grievous, how dolorous was this to the young lady, who loved him\r\nmore than her life, each one of you may conceive for herself. She\r\nbewept him sore and many a time called him in vain; but after she had\r\nhandled him in every part of his body and found him cold in all,\r\nperceiving that he was altogether dead and knowing not what to do or\r\nto say, she went, all tearful as she was and full of anguish, to call\r\nher maid, who was privy to their loves, and discovered to her misery\r\nand her grief. Then, after they had awhile made woeful lamentation\r\nover Gabriotto's dead face, the young lady said to the maid, 'Since\r\nGod hath bereft me of him I love, I purpose to abide no longer on\r\nlife; but, ere I go about to slay myself, I would fain take fitting\r\nmeans to preserve my honour and the secret of the love that hath been\r\nbetween us twain and that the body, wherefrom the gracious spirit is\r\ndeparted, may be buried.'\r\n\r\n'Daughter mine,' answered the maid, 'talk not of seeking to slay\r\nthyself, for that, if thou have lost him in this world, by slaying\r\nthyself thou wouldst lose him in the world to come also, since thou\r\nwouldst go to hell, whither I am assured his soul hath not gone; for\r\nhe was a virtuous youth. It were better far to comfort thyself and\r\nthink of succouring his soul with prayers and other good works, so\r\nhaply he have need thereof for any sin committed. The means of burying\r\nhim are here at hand in this garden and none will ever know of the\r\nmatter, for none knoweth that he ever came hither. Or, an thou wilt\r\nnot have it so, let us put him forth of the garden and leave him be;\r\nhe will be found to-morrow morning and carried to his house, where his\r\nkinsfolk will have him buried.' The young lady, albeit she was full of\r\nbitter sorrow and wept without ceasing, yet gave ear to her maid's\r\ncounsels and consenting not to the first part thereof, made answer to\r\nthe second, saying, 'God forbid that I should suffer so dear a youth\r\nand one so beloved of me and my husband to be buried after the fashion\r\nof a dog or left to lie in the street! He hath had my tears and\r\ninasmuch as I may, he shall have those of his kinsfolk, and I have\r\nalready bethought me of that which we have to do to that end.'\r\n\r\nTherewith she despatched her maid for a piece of cloth of silk, which\r\nshe had in a coffer of hers, and spreading it on the earth, laid\r\nGabriotto's body thereon, with his head upon a pillow. Then with many\r\ntears she closed his eyes and mouth and weaving him a chaplet of\r\nroses, covered him with all they had gathered, he and she; after which\r\nshe said to the maid, 'It is but a little way hence to his house;\r\nwherefore we will carry him thither, thou and I, even as we have\r\narrayed him, and lay him before the door. It will not be long ere it\r\nbe day and he will be taken up; and although this may be no\r\nconsolation to his friends, yet to me, in whose arms he died, it will\r\nbe a pleasure.' So saying, once more with most abundant tears she cast\r\nherself upon his face and wept a great while. Then, being urged by her\r\nmaid to despatch, for that the day was at hand, she rose to her feet\r\nand drawing from her finger the ring wherewith Gabriotto had espoused\r\nher, she set it on his and said, weeping, 'Dear my lord, if thy soul\r\nnow seeth my tears or if any sense or cognizance abide in the body,\r\nafter the departure thereof, benignly receive her last gift, whom,\r\nliving, thou lovedst so well.' This said, she fell down upon him in a\r\nswoon, but, presently coming to herself and rising, she took up,\r\ntogether with her maid, the cloth whereon the body lay and going forth\r\nthe garden therewith, made for his house.\r\n\r\nAs they went, they were discovered and taken with the dead body by\r\nthe officers of the provostry, who chanced to be abroad at that hour\r\nabout some other matter. Andrevuola, more desirous of death than of\r\nlife, recognizing the officers, said frankly, 'I know who you are and\r\nthat it would avail me nothing to seek to flee; I am ready to go with\r\nyou before the Seignory and there declare how the case standeth; but\r\nlet none of you dare to touch me, provided I am obedient to you, or to\r\nremove aught from this body, an he would not be accused of me.'\r\nAccordingly, without being touched of any, she repaired, with\r\nGabriotto's body, to the palace, where the Provost, hearing what was\r\nto do, arose and sending for her into his chamber, proceeded to\r\nenquire of this that had happened. To this end he caused divers\r\nphysicians look if the dead man had been done to death with poison or\r\notherwise, who all affirmed that it was not so, but that some\r\nimposthume had burst near the heart, the which had suffocated him. The\r\nmagistrate hearing this and feeling her to be guilty in [but] a small\r\nmatter, studied to make a show of giving her that which he could not\r\nsell her and told her that, an she would consent to his pleasures, he\r\nwould release her; but, these words availing not, he offered, out of\r\nall seemliness, to use force. However, Andrevuola, fired with disdain\r\nand waxed strong [for indignation], defended herself manfully,\r\nrebutting him with proud and scornful words.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, broad day come and these things being recounted to Messer\r\nNegro, he betook himself, sorrowful unto death, to the palace, in\r\ncompany with many of his friends, and being there acquainted by the\r\nProvost with the whole matter, demanded resentfully[249] that his\r\ndaughter should be restored to him. The Provost, choosing rather to\r\naccuse himself of the violence he would have done her than to be\r\naccused of her, first extolled the damsel and her constancy and in\r\nproof thereof, proceeded to tell that which he had done; by reason\r\nwhereof, seeing her of so excellent a firmness, he had vowed her an\r\nexceeding love and would gladly, an it were agreeable to him, who was\r\nher father, and to herself, espouse her for his lady, notwithstanding\r\nshe had had a husband of mean condition. Whilst they yet talked,\r\nAndrevuola presented herself and weeping, cast herself before her\r\nfather and said, 'Father mine, methinketh there is no need that I\r\nrecount to you the story of my boldness and my illhap, for I am\r\nassured that you have heard and know it; wherefore, as most I may, I\r\nhumbly ask pardon of you for my default, to wit, the having without\r\nyour knowledge taken him who most pleased me to husband. And this boon\r\nI ask of you, not for that my life may be spared me, but to die your\r\ndaughter and not your enemy.' So saying, she fell weeping at his feet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 249: Lit. complaining, making complaint (_dolendosi_).]\r\n\r\nMesser Negro, who was an old man and kindly and affectionate of his\r\nnature, hearing these words, began to weep and with tears in his eyes\r\nraised his daughter tenderly to her feet and said, 'Daughter mine, it\r\nhad better pleased me that thou shouldst have had such a husband as,\r\naccording to my thinking, behoved unto thee; and that thou shouldst\r\nhave taken such an one as was pleasing unto thee had also been\r\npleasing to me; but that thou shouldst have concealed him, of thy\r\nlittle confidence in me, grieveth me, and so much the more as I see\r\nthee to have lost him, ere I knew it. However, since the case is so,\r\nthat which had he lived, I had gladly done him, to content thee, to\r\nwit, honour, as to my son-in-law, be it done him, now he is dead.'\r\nThen, turning to his sons and his kinsfolk, he commanded that great\r\nand honourable obsequies should be prepared for Gabriotto.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the kinsmen and kinswomen of the young man, hearing the\r\nnews, had flocked thither, and with them well nigh all the men and\r\nwomen in the city. Therewith, the body, being laid out amiddleward the\r\ncourtyard upon Andrevuola's silken cloth and strewn, with all her\r\nroses, was there not only bewept by her and his kinsfolk, but publicly\r\nmourned by well nigh all the ladies of the city and by many men, and\r\nbeing brought forth of the courtyard of the Seignory, not as that of a\r\nplebeian, but as that of a nobleman, it was with the utmost honour\r\nborne to the sepulchre upon the shoulders of the most noble citizens.\r\nSome days thereafterward, the Provost ensuing that which he had\r\ndemanded, Messer Negro propounded it to his daughter, who would hear\r\nnought thereof, but, her father being willing to comply with her in\r\nthis, she and her maid made themselves nuns in a convent very famous\r\nfor sanctity and there lived honourably a great while after.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Fourth]\r\n\r\n     SIMONA LOVETH PASQUINO AND THEY BEING TOGETHER IN A GARDEN,\r\n     THE LATTER RUBBETH A LEAF OF SAGE AGAINST HIS TEETH AND\r\n     DIETH. SHE, BEING TAKEN AND THINKING TO SHOW THE JUDGE HOW\r\n     HER LOVER DIED, RUBBETH ONE OF THE SAME LEAVES AGAINST HER\r\n     TEETH AND DIETH ON LIKE WISE\r\n\r\n\r\nPamfilo having delivered himself of his story, the king, showing no\r\ncompassion for Andrevuola, looked at Emilia and signed to her that it\r\nwas his pleasure she should with a story follow on those who had\r\nalready told; whereupon she, without delay, began as follows: \"Dear\r\ncompanions, the story told by Pamfilo putteth me in mind to tell you\r\none in nothing like unto his save that like as Andrevuola lost her\r\nbeloved in a garden, even so did she of whom I have to tell, and being\r\ntaken in like manner as was Andrevuola, freed herself from the court,\r\nnot by dint of fortitude nor constancy, but by an unlooked-for death.\r\nAnd as hath otherwhile been said amongst us, albeit Love liefer\r\ninhabiteth the houses of the great, yet not therefor doth he decline\r\nthe empery of those of the poor; nay, whiles in these latter he so\r\nmanifesteth his power that he maketh himself feared, as a most\r\npuissant seignior, of the richer sort. This, if not in all, yet in\r\ngreat part, will appear from my story, with which it pleaseth me to\r\nre-enter our own city, wherefrom this day, discoursing diversely of\r\ndivers things and ranging over various parts of the world, we have so\r\nfar departed.\r\n\r\nThere was, then, no great while ago, in Florence a damsel very\r\nhandsome and agreeable, according to her condition, who was the\r\ndaughter of a poor father and was called Simona; and although it\r\nbehoved her with her own hands earn the bread she would eat and\r\nsustain her life by spinning wool, she was not therefor of so poor a\r\nspirit but that she dared to admit into her heart Love, which,--by\r\nmeans of the pleasing words and fashions of a youth of no greater\r\naccount than herself, who went giving wool to spin for a master of\r\nhis, a wool-monger,--had long made a show of wishing to enter there.\r\nHaving, then, received Him into her bosom with the pleasing aspect of\r\nthe youth who loved her whose name was Pasquino, she heaved a thousand\r\nsighs, hotter than fire, at every hank of yarn she wound about the\r\nspindle, bethinking her of him who had given it her to spin and\r\nardently desiring, but venturing not to do more. He, on his side,\r\ngrown exceeding anxious that his master's wool should be well spun,\r\noverlooked Simona's spinning more diligently than that of any other,\r\nas if the yarn spun by her alone and none other were to furnish forth\r\nthe whole cloth; wherefore, the one soliciting and the other\r\ndelighting to be solicited, it befell that, he growing bolder than of\r\nhis wont and she laying aside much of the timidity and shamefastness\r\nshe was used to feel, they gave themselves up with a common accord to\r\nmutual pleasures, which were so pleasing to both that not only did\r\nneither wait to be bidden thereto of the other, but each forewent\r\nother in the matter of invitation.\r\n\r\nEnsuing this their delight from day to day and waxing ever more\r\nenkindled for continuance, it chanced one day that Pasquino told\r\nSimona he would fain have her find means to come to a garden, whither\r\nhe wished to carry her so they might there foregather more at their\r\nease and with less suspect. Simona answered that she would well and\r\naccordingly on Sunday, after eating, giving her father to believe that\r\nshe meant to go a-pardoning to San Gallo,[250] she betook herself,\r\nwith a friend of hers, called Lagina, to the garden appointed her of\r\nPasquino. There she found him with a comrade of his, whose name was\r\nPuccino, but who was commonly called Stramba,[251] and an amorous\r\nacquaintance being quickly clapped up between the latter and Lagina,\r\nSimona and her lover withdrew to one part of the garden, to do their\r\npleasure, leaving Stramba and Lagina in another.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 250: _i.e._ to attend the ecclesiastical function called a\r\nPardon, with which word, used in this sense, Meyerbeer's opera of\r\nDinorah (properly Le Pardon de Ploërmel) has familiarized opera-goers.\r\nA Pardon is a sort of minor jubilee of the Roman Catholic Church, held\r\nin honour of some local saint, at which certain indulgences and\r\nremissions of sins (hence the name) are granted to the faithful\r\nattending the services of the occasion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 251: _i.e._ Bandy-legs.]\r\n\r\nNow in that part of the garden, whither Pasquino and Simona had\r\nbetaken themselves, was a very great and goodly bush of sage, at the\r\nfoot whereof they sat down and solaced themselves together a great\r\nwhile, holding much discourse of a collation they purposed to make\r\nthere at their leisure. Presently, Pasquino turned to the great\r\nsage-bush and plucking a leaf thereof, began to rub his teeth and gums\r\nwithal, avouching that sage cleaned them excellent well of aught that\r\nmight be left thereon after eating. After he had thus rubbed them\r\nawhile, he returned to the subject of the collation, of which he had\r\nalready spoken, nor had he long pursued his discourse when he began\r\naltogether to change countenance and well nigh immediately after lost\r\nsight and speech, and in a little while he died. Simona, seeing this,\r\nfell to weeping and crying out and called Stramba and Lagina, who ran\r\nthither in haste and seeing Pasquino not only dead, but already grown\r\nall swollen and full of dark spots about his face and body, Stramba\r\ncried out of a sudden, 'Ah, wicked woman! Thou hast poisoned him.'\r\nMaking a great outcry, he was heard of many who dwelt near the garden\r\nand who, running to the clamour, found Pasquino dead and swollen.\r\n\r\nHearing Stramba lamenting and accusing Simona of having poisoned him\r\nof her malice, whilst she, for dolour of the sudden mishap that had\r\ncarried off her lover, knew not how to excuse herself, being as it\r\nwere beside herself, they all concluded that it was as he said; and\r\naccordingly she was taken and carried off, still weeping sore, to the\r\nProvost's palace, where, at the instance of Stramba and other two\r\ncomrades of Pasquino, by name Atticciato and Malagevole, who had come\r\nup meanwhile, a judge addressed himself without delay to examine her\r\nof the fact and being unable to discover that she had done malice in\r\nthe matter or was anywise guilty, he bethought himself, in her\r\npresence, to view the dead body and the place and manner of the\r\nmishap, as recounted to him by her, for that he apprehended it not\r\nvery well by her words.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, he let bring her, without any stir, whereas Pasquino's\r\nbody lay yet, swollen as it were a tun, and himself following her\r\nthither, marvelled at the dead man and asked her how it had been;\r\nwhereupon, going up to the sage-bush, she recounted to him all the\r\nforegoing story and to give him more fully to understand how the thing\r\nhad befallen, she did even as Pasquino had done and rubbed one of the\r\nsage-leaves against her teeth. Then,--whilst her words were, in the\r\njudge's presence, flouted by Stramba and Atticciato and the other\r\nfriends and comrades of Pasquino as frivolous and vain and they all\r\ndenounced her wickedness with the more instance, demanding nothing\r\nless than that the fire should be the punishment of such\r\nperversity,--the wretched girl, who abode all confounded for dolour of\r\nher lost lover and fear of the punishment demanded by Stramba fell,\r\nfor having rubbed the sage against her teeth, into that same\r\nmischance, whereinto her lover had fallen [and dropped dead], to the\r\nno small wonderment of as many as were present. O happy souls, to whom\r\nit fell in one same day to terminate at once your fervent love and\r\nyour mortal life! Happier yet, an ye went together to one same place!\r\nAnd most happy, if folk love in the other life and ye love there as\r\nyou loved here below! But happiest beyond compare,--at least in our\r\njudgment who abide after her on life,--was Simona's soul, whose\r\ninnocence fortune suffered not to fall under the testimony of Stramba\r\nand Atticciato and Malagevole, wool-carders belike or men of yet\r\nmeaner condition, finding her a more honourable way, with a death like\r\nunto that of her lover, to deliver herself from their calumnies and to\r\nfollow the soul, so dearly loved of her, of her Pasquino.\r\n\r\nThe judge, in a manner astonied, as were likewise as many as were\r\nthere, at this mischance and unknowing what to say, abode long silent;\r\nthen, recollecting himself, he said, 'It seemeth this sage is\r\npoisonous, the which is not wont to happen of sage. But, so it may not\r\navail to offend on this wise against any other, be it cut down even to\r\nthe roots and cast into the fire.' This the keeper of the garden\r\nproceeded to do in the judge's presence, and no sooner had he levelled\r\nthe great bush with the ground than the cause of the death of the two\r\nunfortunate lovers appeared; for thereunder was a toad of marvellous\r\nbigness, by whose pestiferous breath they concluded the sage to have\r\nbecome venomous. None daring approach the beast, they made a great\r\nhedge of brushwood about it and there burnt it, together with the\r\nsage. So ended the judge's inquest upon the death of the unfortunate\r\nPasquino, who, together with his Simona, all swollen as they were, was\r\nburied by Stramba and Atticciato and Guccio Imbratta and Malagevole in\r\nthe church of St. Paul, whereof it chanced they were parishioners.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Fourth]\r\n\r\n     GIROLAMO LOVETH SALVESTRA AND BEING CONSTRAINED BY HIS\r\n     MOTHER'S PRAYERS TO GO TO PARIS, RETURNETH AND FINDETH HIS\r\n     MISTRESS MARRIED; WHEREUPON HE ENTERETH HER HOUSE BY STEALTH\r\n     AND DIETH BY HER SIDE; AND HE BEING CARRIED TO A CHURCH,\r\n     SALVESTRA DIETH BESIDE HIM\r\n\r\n\r\nEmilia's story come to an end, Neifile, by the king's commandment,\r\nbegan thus: \"There are some, noble ladies, who believe themselves to\r\nknow more than other folk, albeit, to my thinking, they know less, and\r\nwho, by reason thereof, presume to oppose their judgment not only to\r\nthe counsels of men, but even to set it up against the very nature of\r\nthings; of which presumption very grave ills have befallen aforetime,\r\nnor ever was any good known to come thereof. And for that of all\r\nnatural things love is that which least brooketh contrary counsel or\r\nopposition and whose nature is such that it may lightlier consume of\r\nitself than be done away by advisement, it hath come to my mind to\r\nnarrate to you a story of a lady, who, seeking to be wiser than\r\npertained unto her and than she was, nay, than the matter comported in\r\nwhich she studied to show her wit, thought to tear out from an\r\nenamoured heart a love which had belike been set there of the stars,\r\nand so doing, succeeded in expelling at once love and life from her\r\nson's body.\r\n\r\nThere was, then, in our city, according to that which the ancients\r\nrelate, a very great and rich merchant, whose name was Lionardo\r\nSighieri and who had by his wife a son called Girolamo, after whose\r\nbirth, having duly set his affairs in order, he departed this life.\r\nThe guardians of the boy, together with his mother, well and loyally\r\nordered his affairs, and he, growing up with his neighbour's children,\r\nbecame familiar with a girl of his own age, the daughter of the\r\ntailor, more than with any other of the quarter. As he waxed in age,\r\nuse turned to love so great and so ardent that he was never easy save\r\nwhat time he saw her, and certes she loved him no less than she was\r\nloved of him. The boy's mother, observing this, many a time chid and\r\nrebuked him therefor and after, Girolamo availing not to desist\r\ntherefrom, complained thereof to his guardians, saying to them, as if\r\nshe thought, thanks to her son's great wealth, to make an orange-tree\r\nof a bramble, 'This boy of ours, albeit he is yet scarce fourteen\r\nyears old, is so enamoured of the daughter of a tailor our neighbour,\r\nby name Salvestra, that, except we remove her from his sight, he will\r\nperadventure one day take her to wife, without any one's knowledge,\r\nand I shall never after be glad; or else he will pine away from her,\r\nif he see her married to another; wherefore meseemeth, to avoid this,\r\nyou were best send him somewhither far from here, about the business\r\nof the warehouse; for that, he being removed from seeing her, she will\r\npass out of his mind and we may after avail to give him some well-born\r\ndamsel to wife.'\r\n\r\nThe guardians answered that the lady said well and that they would do\r\nthis to the best of their power; wherefore, calling the boy into the\r\nwarehouse, one of them began very lovingly to bespeak him thus, 'My\r\nson, thou art now somewhat waxen in years and it were well that thou\r\nshouldst begin to look for thyself to thine affairs; wherefore it\r\nwould much content us that thou shouldst go sojourn awhile at Paris,\r\nwhere thou wilt see how great part of thy wealth is employed, more by\r\ntoken that thou wilt there become far better bred and mannered and\r\nmore of worth than thou couldst here, seeing the lords and barons and\r\ngentlemen who are there in plenty and learning their usances; after\r\nwhich thou mayst return hither.' The youth hearkened diligently and\r\nanswered curtly that he was nowise disposed to do this, for that he\r\nbelieved himself able to fare as well at Florence as another. The\r\nworthy men, hearing this, essayed him again with sundry discourse,\r\nbut, failing to get other answer of him, told his mother, who, sore\r\nprovoked thereat, gave him a sound rating, not because of his\r\nunwillingness to go to Paris, but of his enamourment; after which, she\r\nfell to cajoling him with fair words, coaxing him and praying him\r\nsoftly be pleased to do what his guardians wished; brief, she\r\ncontrived to bespeak him to such purpose that he consented to go to\r\nFrance and there abide a year and no more.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, ardently enamoured as he was, he betook himself to Paris\r\nand there, being still put off from one day to another, he was kept\r\ntwo years; at the end of which time, returning, more in love than\r\never, he found his Salvestra married to an honest youth, a tent maker.\r\nAt this he was beyond measure woebegone; but, seeing no help for it,\r\nhe studied to console himself therefor and having spied out where she\r\ndwelt, began, after the wont of young men in love, to pass before\r\nher, expecting she should no more have forgotten him than he her. But\r\nthe case was otherwise; she had no more remembrance of him than if she\r\nhad never seen him; or, if indeed she remembered aught of him, she\r\nfeigned the contrary; and of this, in a very brief space of time,\r\nGirolamo became aware, to his no small chagrin. Nevertheless, he did\r\nall he might to bring himself to her mind; but, himseeming he wrought\r\nnothing, he resolved to speak with her, face to face, though he should\r\ndie for it.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, having learned from a neighbour how her house stood, one\r\nevening that she and her husband were gone to keep wake with their\r\nneighbours, he entered therein by stealth and hiding himself behind\r\ncertain tent cloths that were spread there, waited till, the twain\r\nhaving returned and gotten them to bed, he knew her husband to be\r\nasleep; whereupon he came whereas he had seen Salvestra lay herself\r\nand putting his hand upon her breast, said softly, 'Sleepest thou yet,\r\nO my soul?' The girl, who was awake, would have cried out; but he said\r\nhastily, 'For God's sake, cry not, for I am thy Girolamo.' She,\r\nhearing this, said, all trembling, 'Alack, for God's sake, Girolamo,\r\nget thee gone; the time is past when it was not forbidden unto our\r\nchildishness to be lovers. I am, as thou seest, married and it\r\nbeseemeth me no more to have regard to any man other than my husband;\r\nwherefore I beseech thee, by God the Only, to begone, for that, if my\r\nhusband heard thee, even should no other harm ensue thereof, yet would\r\nit follow that I might never more avail to live with him in peace or\r\nquiet, whereas now I am beloved of him and abide with him in weal and\r\nin tranquility.'\r\n\r\nThe youth, hearing these words, was grievously endoloured and recalled\r\nto her the time past and his love no whit grown less for absence,\r\nmingling many prayers and many great promises, but obtained nothing;\r\nwherefore, desiring to die, he prayed her at last that, in requital of\r\nso much love, she would suffer him couch by her side, so he might warm\r\nhimself somewhat, for that he was grown chilled, awaiting her,\r\npromising her that he would neither say aught to her nor touch her and\r\nwould get him gone, so soon as he should be a little warmed.\r\nSalvestra, having some little compassion of him, granted him this he\r\nasked, upon the conditions aforesaid, and he accordingly lay down\r\nbeside her, without touching her. Then, collecting into one thought\r\nthe long love he had borne her and her present cruelty and his lost\r\nhope, he resolved to live no longer; wherefore, straitening in himself\r\nhis vital spirits,[252] he clenched his hands and died by her side,\r\nwithout word or motion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 252: _Ristretti in sè gli spiriti._ An obscure passage;\r\nperhaps \"holding his breath\" is meant; but in this case we should read\r\n\"_lo spirito_\" instead of \"_gli spiriti_.\"]\r\n\r\nAfter a while the young woman, marvelling at his continence and\r\nfearing lest her husband should awake, began to say, 'Alack, Girolamo,\r\nwhy dost thou not get thee gone?' Hearing no answer, she concluded\r\nthat he had fallen asleep and putting out her hand to awaken him,\r\nfound him cold to the touch as ice, whereat she marvelled sore; then,\r\nnudging him more sharply and finding that he stirred not, she felt him\r\nagain and knew that he was dead; whereat she was beyond measure\r\nwoebegone and abode a great while, unknowing what she should do. At\r\nlast she bethought herself to try, in the person of another, what her\r\nhusband should say was to do [in such a case]; wherefore, awakening\r\nhim, she told him, as having happened to another, that which had\r\npresently betided herself and after asked him what counsel she should\r\ntake thereof,[253] if it should happen to herself. The good man\r\nreplied that himseemed the dead man should be quietly carried to his\r\nhouse and there left, without bearing any ill will thereof to the\r\nwoman, who, it appeared to him, had nowise done amiss. Then said\r\nSalvestra, 'And so it behoveth us do'; and taking his hand, made him\r\ntouch the dead youth; whereupon, all confounded, he arose, without\r\nentering into farther parley with his wife, and kindled a light; then,\r\nclothing the dead body in its own garments, he took it, without any\r\ndelay, on his shoulders and carried it, his innocence aiding him, to\r\nthe door of Girolamo's house, where he set it down and left it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 253: _i.e._ what course she should take in the matter,\r\n_consiglio_ used as before (see notes, pp. 2 and 150) in this special\r\nsense.]\r\n\r\nWhen the day came and Girolamo was found dead before his own door,\r\ngreat was outcry, especially on the part of his mother, and the\r\nphysicians having examined him and searched his body everywhere, but\r\nfinding no wound nor bruise whatsoever on him, it was generally\r\nconcluded that he had died of grief, as was indeed the case. Then was\r\nthe body carried into a church and the sad mother, repairing thither\r\nwith many other ladies, kinswomen and neighbours, began to weep\r\nwithout stint and make sore moan over him, according to our usance.\r\nWhat while the lamentation was at it highest, the good man, in whose\r\nhouse he had died, said to Salvestra, 'Harkye, put some mantlet or\r\nother on thy head and get thee to the church whither Girolamo hath\r\nbeen carried and mingle with the women and hearken to that which is\r\ndiscoursed of the matter; and I will do the like among the men, so we\r\nmay hear if aught be said against us.' The thing pleased the girl, who\r\nwas too late grown pitiful and would fain look upon him, dead, whom,\r\nliving, she had not willed to pleasure with one poor kiss, and she\r\nwent thither. A marvellous thing it is to think how uneath to search\r\nout are the ways of love! That heart, which Girolamo's fair fortune\r\nhad not availed to open, his illhap opened and the old flames reviving\r\nall therein, whenas she saw the dead face it[254] melted of a sudden\r\ninto such compassion that she pressed between the women, veiled as she\r\nwas in the mantlet, and stayed not till she won to the body, and\r\nthere, giving a terrible great shriek, she cast herself, face\r\ndownward, on the dead youth, whom she bathed not with many tears, for\r\nthat no sooner did she touch him than grief bereaved her of life, even\r\nas it had bereft him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 254: _i.e._ her heart.]\r\n\r\nThe women would have comforted her and bidden her arise, not yet\r\nknowing her; but after they had bespoken her awhile in vain, they\r\nsought to lift her and finding her motionless, raised her up and knew\r\nher at once for Salvestra and for dead; whereupon all who were there,\r\novercome with double pity, set up a yet greater clamour of\r\nlamentation. The news soon spread abroad among the men without the\r\nchurch and came presently to the ears of her husband, who was amongst\r\nthem and who, without lending ear to consolation or comfort from any,\r\nwept a great while; after which he recounted to many of those who were\r\nthere the story of that which had befallen that night between the dead\r\nyouth and his wife; and so was the cause of each one's death made\r\neverywhere manifest, the which was grievous unto all. Then, taking up\r\nthe dead girl and decking her, as they use to deck the dead, they laid\r\nher beside Girolamo on the same bier and there long bewept her; after\r\nwhich the twain were buried in one same tomb, and so these, whom love\r\nhad not availed to conjoin on life, death conjoined with an\r\ninseparable union.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NINTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Fourth]\r\n\r\n     SIR GUILLAUME DE ROUSSILLON GIVETH HIS WIFE TO EAT THE HEART\r\n     OF SIR GUILLAUME DE GUARDESTAING BY HIM SLAIN AND LOVED OF\r\n     HER, WHICH SHE AFTER COMING TO KNOW, CASTETH HERSELF FROM A\r\n     HIGH CASEMENT TO THE GROUND AND DYING, IS BURIED WITH HER\r\n     LOVER\r\n\r\n\r\nNeifile having made an end of her story, which had awakened no little\r\ncompassion in all the ladies her companions, the king, who purposed\r\nnot to infringe Dioneo his privilege, there being none else to tell\r\nbut they twain, began, \"Gentle ladies, since you have such compassion\r\nupon ill-fortuned loves, it hath occurred to me to tell you a story\r\nwhereof it will behove you have no less pity than of the last, for\r\nthat those to whom that which I shall tell happened were persons of\r\nmore account than those of whom it hath been spoken and yet more cruel\r\nwas the mishap that befell them.\r\n\r\nYou must know, then, that according to that which the Provençals\r\nrelate, there were aforetime in Provence two noble knights, each of\r\nwhom had castles and vassals under him, called the one Sir Guillaume\r\nde Roussillon and the other Sir Guillaume de Guardestaing, and for\r\nthat they were both men of great prowess in arms, they loved each\r\nother with an exceeding love and were wont to go still together and\r\nclad in the same colours to every tournament or jousting or other act\r\nof arms. Although they abode each in his own castle and were distant,\r\none from other, a good half score miles, yet it came to pass that, Sir\r\nGuillaume de Roussillon having a very fair and lovesome lady to wife,\r\nSir Guillaume de Guardestaing, notwithstanding the friendship and\r\nfellowship that was between them, become beyond measure enamoured of\r\nher and so wrought, now with one means and now with another, that the\r\nlady became aware of his passion and knowing him for a very valiant\r\nknight, it pleased her and she began to return his love, insomuch that\r\nshe desired and tendered nothing more than him nor awaited otherwhat\r\nthan to be solicited of him; the which was not long in coming to pass\r\nand they foregathered once and again.\r\n\r\nLoving each other amain and conversing together less discreetly than\r\nbehoved, it befell that the husband became aware of their familiarity\r\nand was mightily incensed thereat, insomuch that the great love he\r\nbore to Guardestaing was turned into mortal hatred; but this he knew\r\nbetter to keep hidden than the two lovers had known to conceal their\r\nlove and was fully resolved in himself to kill him. Roussillon being\r\nin this mind, it befell that a great tourneying was proclaimed in\r\nFrance, the which he forthright signified to Guardestaing and sent to\r\nbid him come to him, an it pleased him, so they might take counsel\r\ntogether if and how they should go thither; whereto the other very\r\njoyously answered that he would without fail come to sup with him on\r\nthe ensuing day. Roussillon, hearing this, thought the time come\r\nwhenas he might avail to kill him and accordingly on the morrow he\r\narmed himself and mounting to horse with a servant of his, lay at\r\nambush, maybe a mile from his castle, in a wood whereas Guardestaing\r\nmust pass.\r\n\r\nThere after he had awaited him a good while, he saw him come, unarmed\r\nand followed by two servants in like case, as one who apprehends\r\nnothing from him; and when he saw him come whereas he would have him,\r\nhe rushed out upon him, lance in hand, full of rage and malice,\r\ncrying, 'Traitor, thou art dead!' And to say thus and to plunge the\r\nlance into his breast were one and the same thing. Guardestaing,\r\nwithout being able to make any defence or even to say a word, fell\r\nfrom his horse, transfixed of the lance, and a little after died,\r\nwhilst his servants, without waiting to learn who had done this,\r\nturned their horses' heads and fled as quickliest they might, towards\r\ntheir lord's castle. Roussillon dismounted and opening the dead man's\r\nbreast with a knife, with his own hands tore out his heart, which he\r\nlet wrap in the pennon of a lance and gave to one of his men to carry.\r\nThen, commanding that none should dare make words of the matter, he\r\nremounted, it being now night, and returned to his castle.\r\n\r\nThe lady, who had heard that Guardestaing was to be there that evening\r\nto supper and looked for him with the utmost impatience, seeing him\r\nnot come, marvelled sore and said to her husband, 'How is it, sir,\r\nthat Guardestaing is not come?' 'Wife,' answered he, 'I have had\r\n[word] from him that he cannot be here till to-morrow'; whereat the\r\nlady abode somewhat troubled. Roussillon then dismounted and calling\r\nthe cook, said to him, 'Take this wild boar's heart and look thou make\r\na dainty dish thereof, the best and most delectable to eat that thou\r\nknowest, and when I am at table, send it to me in a silver porringer.'\r\nThe cook accordingly took the heart and putting all his art thereto\r\nand all his diligence, minced it and seasoning it with store of rich\r\nspices, made of it a very dainty ragout.\r\n\r\nWhen it was time, Sir Guillaume sat down to table with his wife and\r\nthe viands came; but he ate little, being hindered in thought for the\r\nill deed he had committed. Presently the cook sent him the ragout,\r\nwhich he caused set before the lady, feigning himself disordered[255]\r\nthat evening and commending the dish to her amain. The lady, who was\r\nnowise squeamish, tasted thereof and finding it good, ate it all;\r\nwhich when the knight saw, he said to her, 'Wife, how deem you of this\r\ndish?' 'In good sooth, my lord,' answered she, 'it liketh me\r\nexceedingly.' Whereupon, 'So God be mine aid,' quoth Roussillon; 'I do\r\nindeed believe it you, nor do I marvel if that please you, dead,\r\nwhich, alive, pleased you more than aught else.' The lady, hearing\r\nthis, hesitated awhile, then said, 'How? What have you made me eat?'\r\n'This that you have eaten,' answered the knight, 'was in very truth\r\nthe heart of Sir Guillaume de Guardestaing, whom you, disloyal wife as\r\nyou are, so loved; and know for certain that it is his very heart, for\r\nthat I tore it from his breast with these hands a little before my\r\nreturn.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 255: Or surfeited (_svogliato_).]\r\n\r\nIt needeth not to ask if the lady were woebegone, hearing this of him\r\nwhom she loved more than aught else; and after awhile she said, 'You\r\nhave done the deed of a disloyal and base knight, as you are; for, if\r\nI, unenforced of him, made him lord of my love and therein offended\r\nagainst you, not he, but I should have borne the penalty thereof. But\r\nGod forfend that ever other victual should follow upon such noble meat\r\nthe heart of so valiant and so courteous a gentleman as was Sir\r\nGuillaume de Guardestaing!' Then, rising to her feet, without any\r\nmanner of hesitation, she let herself fall backward through a window\r\nwhich was behind her and which was exceeding high above the ground;\r\nwherefore, as she fell, she was not only killed, but well nigh broken\r\nin pieces.\r\n\r\nSir Guillaume, seeing this, was sore dismayed and himseemed he had\r\ndone ill; wherefore, being adread of the country people and of the\r\nCount of Provence, he let saddle his horses and made off. On the\r\nmorrow it was known all over the country how the thing had passed;\r\nwhereupon the two bodies were, with the utmost grief and lamentation,\r\ntaken up by Guardestaing's people and those of the lady and laid in\r\none same sepulchre in the chapel of the latter's own castle; and\r\nthereover were verses written, signifying who these were that were\r\nburied therewithin and the manner and occasion of their death.\"[256]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 256: This is the well-known story of the Troubadour Guillem\r\nde Cabestanh or Cabestaing, whose name Boccaccio alters to\r\nGuardastagno or Guardestaing.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TENTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Fourth]\r\n\r\n     A PHYSICIAN'S WIFE PUTTETH HER LOVER FOR DEAD IN A CHEST,\r\n     WHICH TWO USURERS CARRY OFF TO THEIR OWN HOUSE, GALLANT AND\r\n     ALL. THE LATTER, WHO IS BUT DRUGGED, COMETH PRESENTLY TO\r\n     HIMSELF AND BEING DISCOVERED, IS TAKEN FOR A THIEF; BUT THE\r\n     LADY'S MAID AVOUCHETH TO THE SEIGNORY THAT SHE HERSELF HAD\r\n     PUT HIM INTO THE CHEST STOLEN BY THE TWO USURERS, WHEREBY HE\r\n     ESCAPETH THE GALLOWS AND THE THIEVES ARE AMERCED IN CERTAIN\r\n     MONIES\r\n\r\n\r\nFilostrato having made an end of his telling, it rested only with\r\nDioneo to accomplish his task, who, knowing this and it being\r\npresently commanded him of the king, began as follows: 'The sorrows\r\nthat have been this day related of ill fortuned loves have saddened\r\nnot only your eyes and hearts, ladies, but mine also; wherefore I have\r\nardently longed for an end to be made thereof. Now that, praised be\r\nGod, they are finished (except I should choose to make an ill addition\r\nto such sorry ware, from which God keep me!), I will, without farther\r\nensuing so dolorous a theme, begin with something blither and better,\r\nthereby perchance affording a good argument for that which is to be\r\nrelated on the ensuing day.\r\n\r\nYou must know, then, fairest lasses, that there was in Salerno, no\r\ngreat while since, a very famous doctor in surgery, by name Master\r\nMazzeo della Montagna, who, being already come to extreme old age,\r\ntook to wife a fair and gentle damsel of his city and kept better\r\nfurnished with sumptuous and rich apparel and jewels and all that can\r\npleasure a lady than any woman of the place. True it is she went\r\na-cold most of her time, being kept of her husband ill covered abed;\r\nfor, like as Messer Ricardo di Chinzica (of whom we already told)\r\ntaught his wife to observe saints' days and holidays, even so the\r\ndoctor pretended to her that once lying with a woman necessitated I\r\nknow not how many days' study to recruit the strength and the like\r\ntoys; whereof she abode exceeding ill content and like a discreet and\r\nhigh-spirited woman as she was, bethought herself, so she might the\r\nbetter husband the household good, to betake herself to the highway\r\nand seek to spend others' gear. To this end, considering divers young\r\nmen, at last she found one to her mind and on him she set all her\r\nhope; whereof he becoming aware and she pleasing him mightily, he in\r\nlike manner turned all his love upon her.\r\n\r\nThe spark in question was called Ruggieri da Jeroli, a man of noble\r\nbirth, but of lewd life and blameworthy carriage, insomuch that he had\r\nleft himself neither friend nor kinsman who wished him well or cared\r\nto see him and was defamed throughout all Salerno for thefts and other\r\nknaveries of the vilest; but of this the lady recked little, he\r\npleasing her for otherwhat, and with the aid of a maid of hers, she\r\nwrought on such wise that they came together. After they had taken\r\nsome delight, the lady proceeded to blame his past way of life and to\r\npray him, for the love of her, to desist from these ill fashions; and\r\nto give him the means of doing this, she fell to succouring him, now\r\nwith one sum of money and now with another. On this wise they abode\r\ntogether, using the utmost discretion, till it befell that a sick man\r\nwas put into the doctor's hands, who had a gangrened leg, and Master\r\nMazzeo, having examined the case, told the patient's kinsfolk that,\r\nexcept a decayed bone he had in his leg were taken out, needs must he\r\nhave the whole limb cut off or die, and that, by taking out the bone,\r\nhe might recover, but that he would not undertake him otherwise than\r\nfor a dead man; to which those to whom the sick man pertained agreed\r\nand gave the latter into his hands for such. The doctor, judging that\r\nthe patient might not brook the pain nor would suffer himself to be\r\noperated, without an opiate, and having appointed to set about the\r\nmatter at evensong, let that morning distil a certain water of his\r\ncomposition, which being drunken by the sick man, should make him\r\nsleep so long as he deemed necessary for the performing of the\r\noperation upon him, and fetching it home, set it in his chamber,\r\nwithout telling any what it was.\r\n\r\nThe hour of vespers come and the doctor being about to go to the\r\npatient in question, there came to him a messenger from certain very\r\ngreat friends of his at Malfi, charging him fail not for anything to\r\nrepair thither incontinent, for that there had been a great fray\r\nthere, in which many had been wounded. Master Mazzeo accordingly put\r\noff the tending of the leg until the ensuing morning and going aboard\r\na boat, went off to Malfi, whereupon his wife, knowing that he would\r\nnot return home that night, let fetch Ruggieri, as of her wont, and\r\nbringing him into her chamber, locked him therewithin, against certain\r\nother persons of the house should be gone to sleep. Ruggieri, then,\r\nabiding in the chamber, awaiting his mistress, and being,--whether for\r\nfatigue endured that day or salt meat that he had eaten or maybe for\r\nusance,--sore, athirst, caught sight of the flagon of water, which the\r\ndoctor had prepared for the sick man and which stood in the window,\r\nand deeming it drinking water, set it to his mouth and drank it all\r\noff; nor was it long ere a great drowsiness took him and he fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nThe lady came to the chamber as first she might and finding Ruggieri\r\nasleep, nudged him and bade him in a low voice arise, but to no\r\neffect, for he replied not neither stirred anywhit; whereat she was\r\nsomewhat vexed and nudged him more sharply, saying, 'Get up, slugabed!\r\nAn thou hadst a mind to sleep, thou shouldst have betaken thee to\r\nthine own house and not come hither.' Ruggieri, being thus pushed,\r\nfell to the ground from a chest whereon he lay and gave no more sign\r\nof life than a dead body; whereupon the lady, now somewhat alarmed,\r\nbegan to seek to raise him up and to shake him more roughly, tweaking\r\nhim by the nose and plucking him by the beard, but all in vain; he had\r\ntied his ass to a fast picket.[257] At this she began to fear lest he\r\nwere dead; nevertheless she proceeded to pinch him sharply and burn\r\nhis flesh with a lighted taper, but all to no purpose; wherefore,\r\nbeing no doctress, for all her husband was a physician, she doubted\r\nnot but he was dead in very deed. Loving him over all else as she\r\ndid, it needeth no asking if she were woebegone for this and daring\r\nnot make any outcry, she silently fell a-weeping over him and\r\nbewailing so sore a mishap.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 257: A proverbial way of saying that he was fast asleep.]\r\n\r\nAfter awhile, fearing to add shame to her loss, she bethought herself\r\nthat it behoved her without delay find a means of carrying the dead\r\nman forth of the house and knowing not how to contrive this, she\r\nsoftly called her maid and discovering to her her misadventure sought\r\ncounsel of her. The maid marvelled exceedingly and herself pulled and\r\npinched Ruggieri, but, finding him without sense or motion, agreed\r\nwith her mistress that he was certainly dead and counselled her put\r\nhim forth of the house. Quoth the lady, 'And where can we put him, so\r\nit may not be suspected, whenas he shall be seen to-morrow morning,\r\nthat he hath been brought out hence?' 'Madam,' answered the maid, 'I\r\nsaw, this evening at nightfall, over against the shop of our neighbour\r\nyonder the carpenter, a chest not overbig, the which, an the owner\r\nhave not taken it in again, will come very apt for our affair; for\r\nthat we can lay him therein, after giving him two or three slashes\r\nwith a knife, and leave him be. I know no reason why whoso findeth him\r\nshould suppose him to have been put there from this house rather than\r\notherwhence; nay, it will liefer be believed, seeing he was a young\r\nman of lewd life, that he hath been slain by some enemy of his, whilst\r\ngoing about to do some mischief or other, and after clapped in the\r\nchest.'\r\n\r\nThe maid's counsel pleased the lady, save that she would not hear of\r\ngiving him any wound, saying that for naught in the world would her\r\nheart suffer her to do that. Accordingly she sent her to see if the\r\nchest were yet whereas she had noted it and she presently returned and\r\nsaid, 'Ay.' Then, being young and lusty, with the aid of her mistress,\r\nshe took Ruggieri on her shoulders and carrying him out,--whilst the\r\nlady forewent her, to look if any came,--clapped him into the chest\r\nand shutting down the lid, left him there. Now it chanced that, a day\r\nor two before, two young men, who lent at usance, had taken up their\r\nabode in a house a little farther and lacking household gear, but\r\nhaving a mind to gain much and spend little, had that day espied the\r\nchest in question and had plotted together, if it should abide there\r\nthe night, to carry it off to their own house. Accordingly, midnight\r\ncome, they sallied forth and finding the chest still there, without\r\nlooking farther, they hastily carried it off, for all it seemed to\r\nthem somewhat heavy, to their own house, where they set it down beside\r\na chamber in which their wives slept and there leaving it, without\r\nconcerning themselves for the nonce to settle it overnicely, betook\r\nthem to bed.\r\n\r\nPresently, the morning drawing near, Ruggieri, who had slept a great\r\nwhile, having by this time digested the sleeping draught and exhausted\r\nits effects, awoke and albeit his sleep was broken and his senses in\r\nsome measure restored, there abode yet a dizziness in his brain, which\r\nheld him stupefied, not that night only, but some days after. Opening\r\nhis eyes and seeing nothing, he put out his hands hither and thither\r\nand finding himself in the chest, bethought himself and said, 'What is\r\nthis? Where am I? Am I asleep or awake? Algates I mind me that I came\r\nthis evening into my mistress's chamber and now meseemeth I am in a\r\nchest. What meaneth this? Can the physician have returned or other\r\naccident befallen, by reason whereof the lady hath hidden me here, I\r\nbeing asleep? Methinketh it must have been thus; assuredly it was so.'\r\nAccordingly, he addressed himself to abide quiet and hearken if he\r\ncould hear aught and after he had abidden thus a great while, being\r\nsomewhat ill at ease in the chest, which was small, and the side\r\nwhereon he lay irking him, he would have turned over to the other and\r\nwrought so dexterously that, thrusting his loins against one of the\r\nsides of the chest, which had not been set on a level place, he caused\r\nit first to incline to one side and after topple over. In falling, it\r\nmade a great noise, whereat the women who slept therenigh awoke and\r\nbeing affrighted, were silent for fear. Ruggieri was sore alarmed at\r\nthe fall of the chest, but, finding that it had opened in the fall,\r\nchose rather, if aught else should betide, to be out of it than to\r\nabide therewithin. Accordingly, he came forth and what with knowing\r\nnot where he was and what with one thing and another, he fell to\r\ngroping about the house, so haply he should find a stair or a door,\r\nwhereby he might get him gone.\r\n\r\nThe women, hearing this, began to say, 'Who is there?' But Ruggieri,\r\nknowing not the voice, answered not; whereupon they proceeded to call\r\nthe two young men, who, for that they had overwatched themselves,\r\nslept fast and heard nothing of all this. Thereupon the women, waxing\r\nmore fearful, arose and betaking themselves to the windows, fell\r\na-crying, 'Thieves! Thieves!' At this sundry of the neighbours ran up\r\nand made their way, some by the roof and some by one part and some by\r\nanother, into the house; and the young men also, awaking for the\r\nnoise, arose and seized Ruggieri, who finding himself there, was in a\r\nmanner beside himself for wonderment and saw no way of escape. Then\r\nthey gave him into the hands of the officers of the governor of the\r\ncity, who had now run thither at the noise and carried him before\r\ntheir chief. The latter, for that he was held of all a very sorry\r\nfellow, straightway put him to the question and he confessed to having\r\nentered the usurers' house to steal; whereupon the governor thought to\r\nlet string him up by the neck without delay.\r\n\r\nThe news was all over Salerno by the morning that Ruggieri had been\r\ntaken in the act of robbing the money-lenders' house, which the lady\r\nand her maid hearing, they were filled with such strange and exceeding\r\nwonderment that they were like to persuade themselves that they had\r\nnot done, but had only dreamed of doing, that which they had done\r\novernight; whilst the lady, to boot, was so concerned at the news of\r\nthe danger wherein Ruggieri was that she was like to go mad. Soon\r\nafter half tierce[258] the physician, having returned from Malfi and\r\nwishing to medicine his patient, called for his prepared water and\r\nfinding the flagon empty, made a great outcry, saying that nothing\r\ncould abide as it was in his house. The lady, who was troubled with\r\nanother great chagrin, answered angrily, saying 'What wouldst thou\r\nsay, doctor, of grave matter, whenas thou makest such an outcry anent\r\na flagonlet of water overset? Is there no more water to be found in\r\nthe world?' 'Wife,' rejoined the physician, 'thou thinkest this was\r\ncommon water; it was not so; nay, it was a water prepared to cause\r\nsleep'; and told her for what occasion he had made it. When she heard\r\nthis, she understood forthright that Ruggieri had drunken the opiate\r\nand had therefore appeared to them dead and said to her husband,\r\n'Doctor, we knew it not; wherefore do you make yourself some more';\r\nand the physician, accordingly, seeing he might not do otherwise, let\r\nmake thereof anew.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 258: _i.e._ about half-past seven a.m.]\r\n\r\nA little after, the maid, who had gone by her mistress's commandment\r\nto learn what should be reported of Ruggieri, returned and said to\r\nher, 'Madam, every one missaith of Ruggieri; nor, for aught I could\r\nhear, is there friend or kinsman who hath risen up or thinketh to rise\r\nup to assist him, and it is held certain that the prefect of police\r\nwill have him hanged to-morrow. Moreover, I have a strange thing to\r\ntell you, to wit, meseemeth I have discovered how he came into the\r\nmoney-lenders' house, and hear how. You know the carpenter overagainst\r\nwhose shop was the chest wherein we laid him; he was but now at the\r\nhottest words in the world with one to whom it seemeth the chest\r\nbelonged; for the latter demanded of him the price of his chest, and\r\nthe carpenter replied that he had not sold it, but that it had that\r\nnight been stolen from him. Whereto, \"Not so,\" quoth the other, \"nay,\r\nthou soldest it to the two young men, the money-lenders yonder, as\r\nthey told me yesternight, when I saw it in their house what time\r\nRuggieri was taken.\" \"They lie,\" answered the carpenter. \"I never sold\r\nit to them; but they stole it from me yesternight. Let us go to them.\"\r\nSo they went off with one accord to the money-lenders' house, and I\r\ncame back hither. On this wise, as you may see, I conclude that\r\nRuggieri was transported whereas he was found; but how he came to life\r\nagain I cannot divine.'\r\n\r\nThe lady now understood very well how the case stood and telling the\r\nmaid what she had heard from the physician, besought her help to save\r\nRuggieri, for that she might, an she would, at once save him and\r\npreserve her honour. Quoth she, 'Madam, teach me how, and I will\r\ngladly do anything.' Whereupon the lady, whose wits were sharpened by\r\nthe urgency of the case, having promptly bethought herself of that\r\nwhich was to do, particularly acquainted the maid therewith, who first\r\nbetook herself to the physician and weeping, began to say to him,\r\n'Sir, it behoveth me ask you pardon of a great fault, which I have\r\ncommitted against you.' 'In what?' asked the doctor, and she, never\r\ngiving over weeping, answered, 'Sir, you know what manner young man is\r\nRuggieri da Jeroli. He took a liking to me awhile agone and partly for\r\nfear and partly for love, needs must I become his mistress.\r\nYesternight, knowing that you were abroad, he cajoled me on such wise\r\nthat I brought him into your house to lie with me in my chamber, and\r\nhe being athirst and I having no whither more quickly to resort for\r\nwater or wine, unwilling as I was that your lady, who was in the\r\nsaloon, should see me, I remembered me to have seen a flagon of water\r\nin your chamber. Accordingly, I ran for it and giving him the water to\r\ndrink, replaced the flagon whence I had taken it, whereof I find you\r\nhave made a great outcry in the house. And certes I confess I did ill;\r\nbut who is there doth not ill bytimes? Indeed, I am exceeding grieved\r\nto have done it, not so much for the thing itself as for that which\r\nhath ensued of it and by reason whereof Ruggieri is like to lose his\r\nlife. Wherefore I pray you, as most I may, pardon me and give me leave\r\nto go succour Ruggieri inasmuch as I can.' The physician, hearing\r\nthis, for all he was angry, answered jestingly, 'Thou hast given\r\nthyself thine own penance therefor, seeing that, whereas thou\r\nthoughtest yesternight to have a lusty young fellow who would shake\r\nthy skincoats well for thee, thou hadst a sluggard; wherefore go and\r\nendeavour for the deliverance of thy lover; but henceforth look thou\r\nbring him not into the house again, or I will pay thee for this time\r\nand that together.'\r\n\r\nThe maid, thinking she had fared well for the first venue, betook\r\nherself, as quickliest she might, to the prison, where Ruggieri lay\r\nand coaxed the gaoler to let her speak with the prisoner, whom after\r\nshe had instructed what answers he should make to the prefect of\r\npolice, an he would fain escape, she contrived to gain admission to\r\nthe magistrate himself. The latter, for that she was young and buxom,\r\nwould fain, ere he would hearken to her, cast his grapnel aboard the\r\ngood wench, whereof she, to be the better heard, was no whit chary;\r\nthen, having quitted herself of the grinding due,[259] 'Sir,' said\r\nshe, 'you have here Ruggieri da Jeroli taken for a thief; but the\r\ntruth is not so.' Then, beginning from the beginning, she told him the\r\nwhole story; how she, being his mistress, had brought him into the\r\nphysician's house and had given him the drugged water to drink,\r\nunknowing what it was, and how she had put him for dead into the\r\nchest; after which she told him the talk she had heard between the\r\nmaster carpenter and the owner of the chest, showing him thereby how\r\nRuggieri had come into the money-lenders' house.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 259: Or \"having risen from the grinding\" (_levatasi dal\r\nmacinio_).]\r\n\r\nThe magistrate, seeing it an easy thing to come at the truth of the\r\nmatter, first questioned the physician if it were true of the water\r\nand found that it was as she had said; whereupon he let summon the\r\ncarpenter and him to whom the chest belonged and the two money-lenders\r\nand after much parley, found that the latter had stolen the chest\r\novernight and put it in their house. Ultimately he sent for Ruggieri\r\nand questioned him where he had lain that night, whereto he replied\r\nthat where he had lain he knew not; he remembered indeed having gone\r\nto pass the night with Master Mazzeo's maid, in whose chamber he had\r\ndrunken water for a sore thirst he had; but what became of him after\r\nhe knew not, save that, when he awoke, he found himself in the\r\nmoney-lenders' house in a chest. The prefect, hearing these things and\r\ntaking great pleasure therein, caused the maid and Ruggieri and the\r\ncarpenter and the money-lenders repeat their story again and again;\r\nand in the end, seeing Ruggieri to be innocent, he released him and\r\namerced the money-lenders in half a score ounces for that they had\r\nstolen the chest. How welcome this was to Ruggieri, none need ask, and\r\nit was beyond measure pleasing to his mistress, who together with her\r\nlover and the precious maid, who had proposed to give him the slashes\r\nwith the knife, many a time after laughed and made merry of the\r\nmatter, still continuing their loves and their disport from good to\r\nbetter; the which I would well might so betide myself, save always the\r\nbeing put in the chest.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf the former stories had saddened the hearts of the lovesome ladies,\r\nthis last one of Dioneo's made them laugh heartily, especially when he\r\nspoke of the prefect casting his grapnel aboard the maid, that they\r\nwere able thus to recover themselves of the melancholy caused by the\r\nothers. But the king, seeing that the sun began to grow yellow and\r\nthat the term of his seignory was come, with very courteous speech\r\nexcused himself to the fair ladies for that which he had done, to wit,\r\nthat he had caused discourse of so sorrowful a matter as that of\r\nlovers' infelicity; which done, he rose to his feet and taking from\r\nhis head the laurel wreath, whilst the ladies waited to see on whom he\r\nshould bestow it, set it daintily on Fiammetta's fair head, saying, \"I\r\nmake over this crown to thee, as to her who will, better than any\r\nother, know how with to-morrow's pleasance to console these ladies our\r\ncompanions of to-day's woefulness.\"\r\n\r\nFiammetta, whose locks were curled and long and golden and fell over\r\nher white and delicate shoulders and whose soft-rounded face was all\r\nresplendent with white lilies and vermeil roses commingled, with two\r\neyes in her head as they were those of a peregrine falcon and a dainty\r\nlittle mouth, the lips whereof seemed twin rubies, answered, smiling,\r\n\"And I, Filostrato, I take it willingly, and that thou mayst be the\r\nbetter cognizant of that which thou hast done, I presently will and\r\ncommand that each prepare to discourse to-morrow of THAT WHICH HATH\r\nHAPPILY BETIDED LOVERS AFTER SUNDRY CRUEL AND MISFORTUNATE\r\nADVENTURES.\" Her proposition[260] was pleasing unto all and she, after\r\nsummoning the seneschal and taking counsel with him of things needful,\r\narising from session, blithely dismissed all the company until\r\nsupper-time. Accordingly, they all proceeded, according to their\r\nvarious appetites, to take their several pleasures, some wandering\r\nabout the garden, whose beauties were not such as might lightly tire,\r\nand other some betaking themselves towards the mills which wrought\r\ntherewithout, whilst the rest fared some hither and some thither,\r\nuntil the hour of supper, which being come, they all foregathered, as\r\nof their wont, anigh the fair fountain and there supped with exceeding\r\npleasance and well served. Presently, arising thence, they addressed\r\nthemselves, as of their wont, to dancing and singing, and Filomena\r\nleading off the dance, the queen said, \"Filostrato, I purpose not to\r\ndepart from the usance of those who have foregone me in the sovranty,\r\nbut, like as they have done, so I intend that a song be sung at my\r\ncommandment; and as I am assured that thy songs are even such as are\r\nthy stories, it is our pleasure that, so no more days than this be\r\ntroubled with thine ill fortunes, thou sing such one thereof as most\r\npleaseth thee.\" Filostrato replied that he would well and forthright\r\nproceeded to sing on this wise:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 260: _i.e._ the theme proposed by her.]\r\n\r\n         Weeping, I demonstrate\r\n     How sore with reason doth my heart complain\r\n     Of love betrayed and plighted faith in vain.\r\n\r\n       Love, whenas first there was of thee imprest\r\n         Thereon[261] her image for whose sake I sigh,\r\n           Sans hope of succour aye,\r\n           So full of virtue didst thou her pourtray,\r\n         That every torment light accounted I\r\n       That through thee to my breast\r\n       Grown full of drear unrest\r\n     And dole, might come; but now, alack! I'm fain\r\n     To own my error, not withouten pain.\r\n\r\n       Yea, of the cheat first was I made aware,\r\n         Seeing myself of her forsaken sheer,\r\n           In whom I hoped alone;\r\n           For, when I deemed myself most fairly grown\r\n         Into her favour and her servant dear,\r\n       Without her thought or care\r\n       Of my to-come despair,\r\n     I found she had another's merit ta'en\r\n     To heart and put me from her with disdain.\r\n\r\n       Whenas I knew me banished from my stead,\r\n         Straight in my heart a dolorous plaint there grew,\r\n           That yet therein hath power,\r\n           And oft I curse the day and eke the hour\r\n         When first her lovesome visage met my view,\r\n       Graced with high goodlihead;\r\n       And more enamouréd\r\n     Than eye, my soul keeps up its dying strain,\r\n     Faith, ardour, hope, blaspheming still amain.\r\n       How void my misery is of all relief\r\n         Thou mayst e'en feel, so sore I call thee, sire,\r\n           With voice all full of woe;\r\n           Ay, and I tell thee that it irks me so\r\n         That death for lesser torment I desire.\r\n       Come, death, then; shear the sheaf\r\n       Of this my life of grief\r\n     And with thy stroke my madness eke assain;\r\n     Go where I may, less dire will be my bane.\r\n\r\n       No other way than death is left my spright,\r\n         Ay, and none other solace for my dole;\r\n           Then give it[262] me straightway,\r\n           Love; put an end withal to my dismay:\r\n       Ah, do it; since fate's spite\r\n       Hath robbed me of delight;\r\n     Gladden thou her, lord, with my death, love-slain,\r\n     As thou hast cheered her with another swain.\r\n\r\n       My song, though none to learn thee lend an ear,\r\n         I reck the less thereof, indeed, that none\r\n           Could sing thee even as I;\r\n           One only charge I give thee, ere I die,\r\n         That thou find Love and unto him alone\r\n       Show fully how undear\r\n       This bitter life and drear\r\n     Is to me, craving of his might he deign\r\n     Some better harbourage I may attain.\r\n\r\n         Weeping I demonstrate\r\n     How sore with reason doth my heart complain\r\n     Of love betrayed and plighted faith in vain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 261: _i.e._ on my heart.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 262: _i.e._ death.]\r\n\r\nThe words of this song clearly enough discovered the state of\r\nFilostrato's mind and the cause thereof, the which belike the\r\ncountenance of a certain lady who was in the dance had yet plainlier\r\ndeclared, had not the shades of the now fallen night hidden the\r\nblushes that rose to her face. But, when he had made an end of his\r\nsong, many others were sung, till such time as the hour of sleep\r\narrived, whereupon, at the queen's commandment, each of the ladies\r\nwithdrew to her chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE ENDETH THE FOURTH DAY\r\nOF THE DECAMERON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Day the Fifth_\r\n\r\n     HERE BEGINNETH THE FIFTH DAY OF THE DECAMERON WHEREIN UNDER\r\n     THE GOVERNANCE OF FIAMMETTA IS DISCOURSED OF THAT WHICH HATH\r\n     HAPPILY BETIDED LOVERS AFTER SUNDRY CRUEL AND MISFORTUNATE\r\n     ADVENTURES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe East was already all white and the rays of the rising sun had made\r\nit light through all our hemisphere, when Fiammetta, allured by the\r\nsweet song of the birds that blithely chanted the first hour of the\r\nday upon the branches, arose and let call all the other ladies and the\r\nthree young men; then, with leisured pace descending into the fields,\r\nshe went a-pleasuring with her company about the ample plain upon the\r\ndewy grasses, discoursing with them of one thing and another, until\r\nthe sun was somewhat risen, when, feeling that its rays began to grow\r\nhot, she turned their steps to their abiding-place. There, with\r\nexcellent wines and confections, she let restore the light fatigue had\r\nand they disported themselves in the delightsome garden until the\r\neating hour, which being come and everything made ready by the\r\ndiscreet seneschal, they sat blithely down to meat, such being the\r\nqueen's pleasure, after they had sung sundry roundelays and a ballad\r\nor two. Having dined orderly and with mirth, not unmindful of their\r\nwonted usance of dancing, they danced sundry short dances to the sound\r\nof songs and tabrets, after which the queen dismissed them all until\r\nthe hour of slumber should be past. Accordingly, some betook\r\nthemselves to sleep, whilst others addressed themselves anew to their\r\ndiversion about the fair garden; but all, according to the wonted\r\nfashion, assembled together again, a little after none, near the fair\r\nfountain, whereas it pleased the queen. Then she, having seated\r\nherself in the chief room, looked towards Pamfilo and smilingly\r\ncharged him make a beginning with the fair-fortuned stories; whereto\r\nhe willingly addressed himself and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Fifth]\r\n\r\n     CIMON, LOVING, WAXETH WISE AND CARRIETH OFF TO SEA IPHIGENIA\r\n     HIS MISTRESS. BEING CAST INTO PRISON AT RHODES, HE IS\r\n     DELIVERED THENCE BY LYSIMACHUS AND IN CONCERT WITH HIM\r\n     CARRIETH OFF IPHIGENIA AND CASSANDRA ON THEIR WEDDING-DAY,\r\n     WITH WHOM THE TWAIN FLEE INTO CRETE, WHERE THE TWO LADIES\r\n     BECOME THEIR WIVES AND WHENCE THEY ARE PRESENTLY ALL FOUR\r\n     RECALLED HOME\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Many stories, delightsome ladies, apt to give beginning to so glad a\r\nday as this will be, offer themselves unto me to be related; whereof\r\none is the most pleasing to my mind, for that thereby, beside the\r\nhappy issue which is to mark this day's discourses, you may understand\r\nhow holy, how puissant and how full of all good is the power of Love,\r\nwhich many, unknowing what they say, condemn and vilify with great\r\nunright; and this, an I err not, must needs be exceeding pleasing to\r\nyou, for that I believe you all to be in love.\r\n\r\nThere was, then, in the island of Cyprus, (as we have read aforetime\r\nin the ancient histories of the Cypriots,) a very noble gentleman, by\r\nname Aristippus, who was rich beyond any other of the country in all\r\ntemporal things and might have held himself the happiest man alive,\r\nhad not fortune made him woeful in one only thing, to wit, that\r\namongst his other children he had a son who overpassed all the other\r\nyouths of his age in stature and goodliness of body, but was a\r\nhopeless dullard and well nigh an idiot. His true name was Galesus,\r\nbut for that neither by toil of teacher nor blandishment nor beating\r\nof his father nor study nor endeavour of whatsoever other had it been\r\nfound possible to put into his head any inkling of letters or good\r\nbreeding and that he had a rough voice and an uncouth and manners more\r\nbefitting a beast than a man, he was of well nigh all by way of\r\nmockery called Cimon, which in their tongue signified as much as brute\r\nbeast in ours. His father brooked his wastrel life with the most\r\ngrievous concern and having presently given over all hope of him, he\r\nbade him begone to his country house[263] and there abide with his\r\nhusbandmen, so he might not still have before him the cause of his\r\nchagrin; the which was very agreeable to Cimon, for that the manners\r\nand usages of clowns and churls were much more to his liking than\r\nthose of the townsfolk.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 263: Or farm (_villa_).]\r\n\r\nCimon, then, betaking himself to the country and there employing\r\nhimself in the things that pertained thereto, it chanced one day,\r\nawhile after noon, as he passed from one farm to another, with his\r\nstaff on his shoulder, that he entered a very fair coppice which was\r\nin those parts and which was then all in leaf, for that it was the\r\nmonth of May. Passing therethrough, he happened (even as his fortune\r\nguided him thither) upon a little mead compassed about with very high\r\ntrees, in one corner whereof was a very clear and cool spring, beside\r\nwhich he saw a very fair damsel asleep upon the green grass, with so\r\nthin a garment upon her body that it hid well nigh nothing of her\r\nsnowy flesh. She was covered only from the waist down with a very\r\nwhite and light coverlet; and at her feet slept on like wise two women\r\nand a man, her servants. When Cimon espied the young lady, he halted\r\nand leaning upon his staff, fell, without saying a word, to gazing\r\nmost intently upon her with the utmost admiration, no otherwise than\r\nas he had never yet seen a woman's form, whilst in his rude breast,\r\nwherein for a thousand lessonings no least impression of civil\r\npleasance had availed to penetrate, he felt a thought awaken which\r\nintimated to his gross and material spirit that this maiden was the\r\nfairest thing that had been ever seen of any living soul. Thence he\r\nproceeded to consider her various parts,--commending her hair, which\r\nhe accounted of gold, her brow, her nose, her mouth, her throat and\r\nher arms, and above all her breast, as yet but little upraised,--and\r\ngrown of a sudden from a churl a judge of beauty, he ardently desired\r\nin himself to see the eyes, which, weighed down with deep sleep, she\r\nkept closed. To this end, he had it several times in mind to awaken\r\nher; but, for that she seemed to him beyond measure fairer than the\r\nother women aforetime seen of him, he misdoubted him she must be some\r\ngoddess. Now he had wit enough to account things divine worthy of more\r\nreverence than those mundane; wherefore he forbore, waiting for her to\r\nawake of herself; and albeit the delay seemed overlong to him, yet,\r\ntaken as he was with an unwonted pleasure, he knew not how to tear\r\nhimself away.\r\n\r\nIt befell, then, that, after a long while, the damsel, whose name was\r\nIphigenia, came to herself, before any of her people, and opening her\r\neyes, saw Cimon (who, what for his fashion and uncouthness and his\r\nfather's wealth and nobility, was known in a manner to every one in\r\nthe country) standing before her, leant on his staff, marvelled\r\nexceedingly and said, 'Cimon, what goest thou seeking in this wood at\r\nthis hour?' He made her no answer, but, seeing her eyes open, began to\r\nlook steadfastly upon them, himseeming there proceeded thence a\r\nsweetness which fulfilled him with a pleasure such as he had never\r\nbefore felt. The young lady, seeing this, began to misdoubt her lest\r\nhis so fixed looking upon her should move his rusticity to somewhat\r\nthat might turn to her shame; wherefore, calling her women, she rose\r\nup, saying, 'Cimon, abide with God.' To which he replied, 'I will\r\nbegone with thee'; and albeit the young lady, who was still in fear of\r\nhim, would have declined his company, she could not win to rid herself\r\nof him till he had accompanied her to her own house.\r\n\r\nThence he repaired to his father's house [in the city,] and declared\r\nto him that he would on no wise consent to return to the country; the\r\nwhich was irksome enough to Aristippus and his kinsfolk; nevertheless\r\nthey let him be, awaiting to see what might be the cause of his change\r\nof mind. Love's arrow having, then, through Iphigenia's beauty,\r\npenetrated into Cimon's heart, whereinto no teaching had ever availed\r\nto win an entrance, in a very brief time, proceeding from one idea to\r\nanother, he made his father marvel and all his kinsfolk and every\r\nother that knew him. In the first place he besought his father that he\r\nwould cause him go bedecked with clothes and every other thing, even\r\nas his brothers, the which Aristippus right gladly did. Then,\r\nconsorting with young men of condition and learning the fashions and\r\ncarriage that behoved unto gentlemen and especially unto lovers, he\r\nfirst, to the utmost wonderment of every one, in a very brief space of\r\ntime, not only learned the first [elements of] letters, but became\r\nvery eminent among the students of philosophy, and after (the love\r\nwhich he bore Iphigenia being the cause of all this) he not only\r\nreduced his rude and rustical manner of speech to seemliness and\r\ncivility, but became a past master of song and sound[264] and\r\nexceeding expert and doughty in riding and martial exercises, both by\r\nland and by sea. In short, not to go recounting every particular of\r\nhis merits, the fourth year was not accomplished from the day of his\r\nfirst falling in love, ere he was grown the sprightliest and most\r\naccomplished gentleman of all the young men in the island of Cyprus,\r\nay, and the best endowed with every particular excellence. What, then,\r\ncharming ladies, shall we say of Cimon? Certes, none other thing than\r\nthat the lofty virtues implanted by heaven in his generous soul had\r\nbeen bounden with exceeding strong bonds of jealous fortune and shut\r\nin some straitest corner of his heart, all which bonds Love, as a\r\nmightier than fortune, broke and burst in sunder and in its quality of\r\nawakener and quickener of drowsed and sluggish wits, urged forth into\r\nbroad daylight the virtues aforesaid, which had till then been\r\noverdarkened with a barbarous obscurity, thus manifestly discovering\r\nfrom how mean a room it can avail to uplift those souls that are\r\nsubject unto it and to what an eminence it can conduct them with its\r\nbeams.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 264: _i.e._ of music, vocal and instrumental.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Cimon, loving Iphigenia as he did, might exceed in certain\r\nthings, as young men in love very often do, nevertheless Aristippus,\r\nconsidering that Love had turned him from a dunce into a man, not only\r\npatiently bore with the extravagances into which it might whiles lead\r\nhim, but encouraged him to ensue its every pleasure. But Cimon, (who\r\nrefused to be called Galesus, remembering that Iphigenia had called\r\nhim by the former name,) seeking to put an honourable term to his\r\ndesire, once and again caused essay Cipseus, Iphigenia's father, so he\r\nshould give him his daughter to wife; but Cipseus still answered that\r\nhe had promised her to Pasimondas, a young nobleman of Rhodes, to whom\r\nhe had no mind to fail of his word. The time coming the covenanted\r\nnuptials of Iphigenia and the bridegroom having sent for her, Cimon\r\nsaid to himself, 'Now, O Iphigenia, is the time to prove how much thou\r\nare beloved of me. By thee am I become a man and so I may but have\r\nthee, I doubt not to become more glorious than any god; and for\r\ncertain I will or have thee or die.'\r\n\r\nAccordingly, having secretly recruited certain young noblemen who were\r\nhis friends and let privily equip a ship with everything apt for naval\r\nbattle, he put out to sea and awaited the vessel wherein Iphigenia was\r\nto be transported to her husband in Rhodes. The bride, after much\r\nhonour done of her father to the bridegroom's friends, took ship with\r\nthe latter, who turned their prow towards Rhodes and departed. On the\r\nfollowing day, Cimon, who slept not, came out upon them with his ship\r\nand cried out, in a loud voice, from the prow, to those who were on\r\nboard Iphigenia's vessel, saying, 'Stay, strike your sails or look to\r\nbe beaten and sunken in the sea.' Cimon's adversaries had gotten up\r\ntheir arms on deck and made ready to defend themselves; whereupon he,\r\nafter speaking the words aforesaid, took a grappling-iron and casting\r\nit upon the poop of the Rhodians, who were making off at the top of\r\ntheir speed, made it fast by main force to the prow of his own ship.\r\nThen, bold as a lion, he leapt on board their ship, without waiting\r\nfor any to follow him, as if he held them all for nought, and Love\r\nspurring him, he fell upon his enemies with marvellous might, cutlass\r\nin hand, striking now this one and now that and hewing them down like\r\nsheep.\r\n\r\nThe Rhodians, seeing this, cast down their arms and all as with one\r\nvoice confessed themselves prisoners; whereupon quoth Cimon to them,\r\n'Young men, it was neither lust of rapine nor hate that I had against\r\nyou made me depart Cyprus to assail you, arms in hand, in mid sea.\r\nThat which moved me thereunto was the desire of a thing which to have\r\ngotten is a very grave matter to me and to you a very light one to\r\nyield me in peace; it is, to wit, Iphigenia, whom I loved over all\r\nelse and whom, availing not to have of her father on friendly and\r\npeaceful wise, Love hath constrained me to win from you as an enemy\r\nand by force of arms. Wherefor I mean to be to her that which your\r\nfriend Pasimondas should have been. Give her to me, then, and begone\r\nand God's grace go with you.'\r\n\r\nThe Rhodians, more by force constrained than of freewill, surrendered\r\nIphigenia, weeping, to Cimon, who, seeing her in tears, said to her,\r\n'Noble Lady, be not disconsolate; I am thy Cimon, who by long love\r\nhave far better deserved to have thee than Pasimondas by plighted\r\nfaith.' Thereupon he caused carry her aboard his own ship and\r\nreturning to his companions, let the Rhodians go, without touching\r\naught else of theirs. Then, glad beyond any man alive to have gotten\r\nso dear a prey, after devoting some time to comforting the weeping\r\nlady, he took counsel with his comrades not to return to Cyprus at\r\nthat present; wherefore, of one accord, they turned the ship's head\r\ntowards Crete, where well nigh every one, and especially Cimon, had\r\nkinsfolk, old and new, and friends in plenty and where they doubted\r\nnot to be in safety with Iphigenia. But fortune the unstable, which\r\nhad cheerfully enough vouchsafed unto Cimon the acquisition of the\r\nlady, suddenly changed the inexpressible joyance of the enamoured\r\nyouth into sad and bitter mourning; for it was not four full told\r\nhours since he had left the Rhodians when the night (which Cimon\r\nlooked to be more delightsome than any he had ever known) came on and\r\nwith it a very troublous and tempestuous shift of weather, which\r\nfilled all the sky with clouds and the sea with ravening winds, by\r\nreason whereof none could see what to do or whither to steer, nor\r\ncould any even keep the deck to do any office.\r\n\r\nHow sore concerned was Cimon for this it needeth not to ask; himseemed\r\nthe gods had vouchsafed him his desire but to make death the more\r\ngrievous to him, whereof, without that, he had before recked little.\r\nHis comrades lamented on like wise, but Iphigenia bewailed herself\r\nover all, weeping sore and fearing every stroke of the waves; and in\r\nher chagrin she bitterly cursed Cimon's love and blamed his\r\npresumption, avouching that the tempest had arisen for none other\r\nthing but that the gods chose not that he, who would fain against\r\ntheir will have her to wife, should avail to enjoy his presumptuous\r\ndesire, but, seeing her first die, should after himself perish\r\nmiserably.\r\n\r\nAmidst such lamentations and others yet more grievous, the wind waxing\r\nhourly fiercer and the seamen knowing not what to do, they came,\r\nwithout witting whither they went or availing to change their course,\r\nnear to the island of Rhodes, and unknowing that it was Rhodes, they\r\nused their every endeavour to get to land thereon, an it were\r\npossible, for the saving of their lives. In this fortune was\r\nfavourable to them and brought them into a little bight of the sea,\r\nwhere the Rhodians whom Cimon had let go had a little before arrived\r\nwith their ship; nor did they perceive that they had struck the island\r\nof Rhodes till the dawn broke and made the sky somewhat clearer, when\r\nthey found themselves maybe a bowshot distant from the ship left of\r\nthem the day before. At this Cimon was beyond measure chagrined and\r\nfearing lest that should betide them which did in very deed ensue,\r\nbade use every endeavour to issue thence and let fortune after carry\r\nthem whither it should please her, for that they could be nowhere in\r\nworse case than there. Accordingly, they made the utmost efforts to\r\nput to sea, but in vain; for the wind blew so mightily against them\r\nthat not only could they not avail to issue from the little harbour,\r\nbut whether they would or no, it drove them ashore.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were they come thither than they were recognized by the\r\nRhodian sailors, who had landed from their ship, and one of them ran\r\nnimbly to a village hard by, whither the young Rhodian gentlemen had\r\nbetaken themselves, and told the latter that, as luck would have\r\nit,[265] Cimon and Iphigenia were come thither aboard their ship,\r\ndriven, like themselves, by stress of weather. They, hearing this,\r\nwere greatly rejoiced and repairing in all haste to the sea-shore,\r\nwith a number of the villagers, took Cimon, together with Iphigenia\r\nand all his company, who had now landed and taken counsel together to\r\nflee into some neighbouring wood, and carried them to the village. The\r\nnews coming to Pasimondas, he made his complaint to the senate of the\r\nisland and according as he had ordered it with them, Lysimachus, in\r\nwhom the chief magistracy of the Rhodians was for that year vested,\r\ncoming thither from the city with a great company of men-at-arms,\r\nhaled Cimon and all his men to prison. On such wise did the wretched\r\nand lovelorn Cimon lose his Iphigenia, scantwhile before won of him,\r\nwithout having taken of her more than a kiss or two; whilst she\r\nherself was received by many noble ladies of Rhodes and comforted as\r\nwell for the chagrin had of her seizure as for the fatigue suffered by\r\nreason of the troubled sea; and with them she abode against the day\r\nappointed for her nuptials.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 265: _Per fortuna._ This may also be rendered \"by tempest,\"\r\n_fortuna_ being a name for a squall or hurricane, which Boccaccio uses\r\nelsewhere in the same sense.]\r\n\r\nAs for Cimon and his companions, their lives were granted them, in\r\nconsideration of the liberty given by them to the young Rhodians the\r\nday before,--albeit Pasimondas used his utmost endeavour to procure\r\nthem to be put to death,--and they were condemned to perpetual prison,\r\nwherein, as may well be believed, they abode woebegone and without\r\nhope of any relief. However, whilst Pasimondas, as most he might,\r\nhastened the preparations for his coming nuptials, fortune, as if\r\nrepenting her of the sudden injury done to Cimon, brought about a new\r\ncircumstance for his deliverance, the which was on this wise.\r\nPasimondas had a brother called Ormisdas, less in years, but not in\r\nmerit, than himself, who had been long in treaty for the hand of a\r\nfair and noble damsel of the city, by name Cassandra, whom Lysimachus\r\nardently loved, and the match had sundry times been broken off by\r\ndivers untoward accidents. Now Pasimondas, being about to celebrate\r\nhis own nuptials with the utmost splendour, bethought himself that it\r\nwere excellently well done if he could procure Ormisdas likewise to\r\ntake wife on the same occasion, not to resort afresh to expense and\r\nfestival making. Accordingly, he took up again the parleys with\r\nCassandra's parents and brought them to a successful issue; wherefore\r\nhe and his brother agreed, in concert with them, that Ormisdas should\r\ntake Cassandra to wife on the same day whenas himself took Iphigenia.\r\n\r\nLysimachus hearing this, it was beyond measure displeasing to him, for\r\nthat he saw himself bereaved of the hope which he cherished, that, an\r\nOrmisdas took her not, he should certainly have her. However, like a\r\nwise man, he kept his chagrin hidden and fell to considering on what\r\nwise he might avail to hinder this having effect, but could see no way\r\npossible save the carrying her off. This seemed easy to him to compass\r\nfor the office which he held, but he accounted the deed far more\r\ndishonourable than if he had not held the office in question.\r\nUltimately, however, after long deliberation, honour gave place to\r\nlove and he determined, come what might of it, to carry off Cassandra.\r\nThen, bethinking himself of the company he must have and the course he\r\nmust hold to do this, he remembered him of Cimon, whom he had in\r\nprison with his comrades, and concluded that he might have no better\r\nor trustier companion than Cimon in this affair.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, that same night he had him privily into his chamber and\r\nproceeded to bespeak him on this wise: 'Cimon, like as the gods are\r\nvery excellent and bountiful givers of things to men, even so are they\r\nmost sagacious provers of their virtues, and those, whom they find\r\nresolute and constant under all circumstances, they hold deserving, as\r\nthe most worthy, of the highest recompenses. They have been minded to\r\nhave more certain proof of thy worth than could be shown by thee\r\nwithin the limits of thy father's house, whom I know to be abundantly\r\nendowed with riches; wherefore, first, with the poignant instigations\r\nof love they brought thee from a senseless animal to be a man, and\r\nafter with foul fortune and at this present with prison dour, they\r\nwould fain try if thy spirit change not from that which it was, whenas\r\nthou wast scantwhile glad of the gotten prize. If that[266] be the\r\nsame as it was erst, they never yet vouchsafed thee aught so gladsome\r\nas that which they are presently prepared to bestow on thee and which,\r\nso thou mayst recover thy wonted powers and resume thy whilom spirit,\r\nI purpose to discover to thee.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 266: _i.e._ thy spirit.]\r\n\r\nPasimondas, rejoicing in thy misadventure and a diligent promoter of\r\nthy death, bestirreth himself as most he may to celebrate his nuptials\r\nwith thine Iphigenia, so therein he may enjoy the prize which fortune\r\nfirst blithely conceded thee and after, growing troubled, took from\r\nthee of a sudden. How much this must grieve thee, an thou love as I\r\nbelieve, I know by myself, to whom Ormisdas his brother prepareth in\r\none same day to do a like injury in the person of Cassandra, whom I\r\nlove over all else. To escape so great an unright and annoy of\r\nfortune, I see no way left open of her to us, save the valour of our\r\nsouls and the might of our right hands, wherein it behoveth us take\r\nour swords and make us a way to the carrying off of our two\r\nmistresses, thee for the second and me for the first time. If, then,\r\nit be dear to thee to have again--I will not say thy liberty, whereof\r\nmethinketh thou reckest little without thy lady, but--thy mistress,\r\nthe gods have put her in thy hands, an thou be willing to second me in\r\nmy emprize.'\r\n\r\nAll Cimon's lost spirit was requickened in him by these words and he\r\nreplied, without overmuch consideration, 'Lysimachus, thou canst have\r\nno stouter or trustier comrade than myself in such an enterprise, an\r\nthat be to ensue thereof for me which thou avouchest; wherefore do\r\nthou command me that which thou deemest should be done of me, and thou\r\nshalt find thyself wonder-puissantly seconded.' Then said Lysimachus,\r\n'On the third day from this the new-married wives will for the first\r\ntime enter their husbands' houses, whereinto thou with thy companions\r\narmed and I with certain of my friends, in whom I put great trust,\r\nwill make our way towards nightfall and snatching up our mistresses\r\nout of the midst of the guests, will carry them off to a ship, which I\r\nhave caused secretly equip, slaying whosoever shall presume to offer\r\nopposition.' The devise pleased Cimon and he abode quiet in prison\r\nuntil the appointed time.\r\n\r\nThe wedding-day being come, great and magnificent was the pomp of the\r\nfestival and every part of the two brothers' house was full of mirth\r\nand merrymaking; whereupon Lysimachus, having made ready everything\r\nneedful, divided Cimon and his companions, together with his own\r\nfriends, all armed under their clothes, into three parties and having\r\nfirst kindled them to his purpose with many words, secretly despatched\r\none party to the harbour, so none might hinder their going aboard the\r\nship, whenas need should be. Then, coming with the other twain, whenas\r\nit seemed to him time, to Pasimondas his house, he left one party of\r\nthem at the door, so as none might shut them up therewithin or forbid\r\nthem the issue, and with Cimon and the rest went up by the stairs.\r\nComing to the saloon where the new-wedded brides were seated orderly\r\nat meat with many other ladies, they rushed in upon them and\r\noverthrowing the tables, took each his mistress and putting them in\r\nthe hands of their comrades, bade straightway carry them to the ship\r\nthat was in waiting. The brides fell a-weeping and shrieking, as did\r\nlikewise the other ladies and the servants, and the whole house was of\r\na sudden full of clamour and lamentation.\r\n\r\nCimon and Lysimachus and their companions, drawing their swords, made\r\nfor the stairs, without any opposition, all giving way to them, and as\r\nthey descended, Pasimondas presented himself before them, with a great\r\ncudgel in his hand, being drawn thither by the outcry; but Cimon dealt\r\nhim a swashing blow on the head and cleaving it sheer in sunder, laid\r\nhim dead at his feet. The wretched Ormisdas, running to his brother's\r\naid, was on like wise slain by one of Cimon's strokes, and divers\r\nothers who sought to draw nigh them were in like manner wounded and\r\nbeaten off by the companions of the latter and Lysimachus, who,\r\nleaving the house full of blood and clamour and weeping and woe, drew\r\ntogether and made their way to the ship with their prizes, unhindered\r\nof any. Here they embarked with their mistresses and all their\r\ncompanions, the shore being now full of armed folk come to the rescue\r\nof the ladies, and thrusting the oars into the water, made off,\r\nrejoicing, about their business. Coming presently to Crete, they were\r\nthere joyfully received by many, both friends and kinsfolk, and\r\nespousing their mistresses with great pomp, gave themselves up to the\r\nglad enjoyment of their purchase. Loud and long were the clamours and\r\ndifferences in Cyprus and in Rhodes by reason of their doings; but,\r\nultimately, their friends and kinsfolk, interposing in one and the\r\nother place, found means so to adjust matters that, after some exile,\r\nCimon joyfully returned to Cyprus with Iphigenia, whilst Lysimachus on\r\nlike wise returned to Rhodes with Cassandra, and each lived long and\r\nhappily with his mistress in his own country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Fifth]\r\n\r\n     COSTANZA LOVETH MARTUCCIO GOMITO AND HEARING THAT HE IS\r\n     DEAD, EMBARKETH FOR DESPAIR ALONE IN A BOAT, WHICH IS\r\n     CARRIED BY THE WIND TO SUSA. FINDING HER LOVER ALIVE AT\r\n     TUNIS, SHE DISCOVERETH HERSELF TO HIM AND HE, BEING GREAT IN\r\n     FAVOUR WITH THE KING FOR COUNSELS GIVEN, ESPOUSETH HER AND\r\n     RETURNETH RICH WITH HER TO LIPARI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe queen, seeing Pamfilo's story at an end, after she had much\r\ncommended it, enjoined Emilia to follow on, telling another, and she\r\naccordingly began thus: \"Every one must naturally delight in those\r\nthings wherein he seeth rewards ensue according to the affections;[267]\r\nand for that love in the long run deserveth rather happiness than\r\naffliction, I shall, intreating of the present theme, obey the queen\r\nwith much greater pleasure to myself than I did the king in that of\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 267: Syn. inclinations (_affezioni_). This is a somewhat\r\nobscure passage, owing to the vagueness of the word _affezioni_ (syn.\r\n_affetti_) in this position, and may be rendered, with about equal\r\nprobability, in more than one way.]\r\n\r\nYou must know, then, dainty dames, that near unto Sicily is an islet\r\ncalled Lipari, wherein, no great while agone, was a very fair damsel\r\ncalled Costanza, born of a very considerable family there. It chanced\r\nthat a young man of the same island, called Martuccio Gomito, who was\r\nvery agreeable and well bred and of approved worth[268] in his\r\ncraft,[269] fell in love with her; and she in like manner so burned\r\nfor him that she was never easy save whenas she saw him. Martuccio,\r\nwishing to have her to wife, caused demand her of her father, who\r\nanswered that he was poor and that therefore he would not give her to\r\nhim. The young man, enraged to see himself rejected for poverty, in\r\nconcert with certain of his friends and kinsmen, equipped a light ship\r\nand swore never to return to Lipari, except rich. Accordingly, he\r\ndeparted thence and turning corsair, fell to cruising off the coast of\r\nBarbary and plundering all who were weaker than himself; wherein\r\nfortune was favourable enough to him, had he known how to set bounds\r\nto his wishes; but, it sufficing him not to have waxed very rich, he\r\nand his comrades, in a brief space of time, it befell that, whilst\r\nthey sought to grow overrich, he was, after a long defence, taken and\r\nplundered with all his companions by certain ships of the Saracens,\r\nwho, after scuttling the vessel and sacking the greater part of the\r\ncrew, carried Martuccio to Tunis, where he was put in prison and long\r\nkept in misery.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 268: Or \"eminent\" (_valoroso_), _i.e._ in modern parlance,\r\n\"a man of merit and talent.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 269: _Valoroso nel suo mestiere._ It does not appear that\r\nMartuccio was a craftsman and it is possible, therefore, that\r\nBoccaccio intended the word _mestiere_ to be taken in the sense (to me\r\nunknown) of \"condition\" or \"estate,\" in which case the passage would\r\nread, \"a man of worth for (_i.e._ as far as comported with) his [mean]\r\nestate\"; and this seems a probable reading.]\r\n\r\nThe news was brought to Lipari, not by one or by two, but by many and\r\ndivers persons, that he and all on board the bark had been drowned;\r\nwhereupon the girl, who had been beyond measure woebegone for her\r\nlover's departure, hearing that he was dead with the others, wept sore\r\nand resolved in herself to live no longer; but, her heart suffering\r\nher not to slay herself by violence, she determined to give a new\r\noccasion[270] to her death.[271] Accordingly, she issued secretly\r\nforth of her father's house one night and betaking herself to the\r\nharbour, happened upon a fishing smack, a little aloof from the other\r\nships, which, for that its owners had but then landed therefrom, she\r\nfound furnished with mast and sail and oars. In this she hastily\r\nembarked and rowed herself out to sea; then, being somewhat skilled in\r\nthe mariner's art, as the women of that island mostly are, she made\r\nsail and casting the oars and rudder adrift, committed herself\r\naltogether to the mercy of the waves, conceiving that it must needs\r\nhappen that the wind would either overturn a boat without lading or\r\nsteersman or drive it upon some rock and break it up, whereby she\r\ncould not, even if she would, escape, but must of necessity be\r\ndrowned. Accordingly, wrapping her head in a mantle, she laid herself,\r\nweeping, in the bottom of the boat.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 270: Lit. necessity (_necessità_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 271: _i.e._ to use a new (or strange) fashion of exposing\r\nherself to an inevitable death (_nuova necessità dare alla sua\r\nmorte_).]\r\n\r\nBut it befell altogether otherwise than as she conceived, for that,\r\nthe wind being northerly and very light and there being well nigh no\r\nsea, the boat rode it out in safety and brought her on the morrow,\r\nabout vespers, to a beach near a town called Susa, a good hundred\r\nmiles beyond Tunis. The girl, who, for aught that might happen, had\r\nnever lifted nor meant to lift her head, felt nothing of being ashore\r\nmore than at sea;[272] but, as chance would have it, there was on the\r\nbeach, whenas the bark struck upon it, a poor woman in act to take up\r\nfrom the sun the nets of the fishermen her masters, who, seeing the\r\nbark, marvelled how it should be left to strike full sail upon the\r\nland. Thinking that the fishermen aboard were asleep, she went up to\r\nthe bark and seeing none therein but the damsel aforesaid, who slept\r\nfast, called her many times and having at last aroused her and knowing\r\nher by her habit for a Christian, asked her in Latin how she came\r\nthere in that bark all alone. The girl, hearing her speak Latin,\r\nmisdoubted her a shift of wind must have driven her back to Lipari and\r\nstarting suddenly to her feet, looked about her, but knew not the\r\ncountry, and seeing herself on land, asked the good woman where she\r\nwas; to which she answered, 'Daughter mine, thou art near unto Susa in\r\nBarbary.' The girl, hearing this, was woeful for that God had not\r\nchosen to vouchsafe her the death she sought, and being in fear of\r\nshame and knowing not what to do, she seated herself at the foot of\r\nher bark and fell a-weeping.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 272: _i.e._ knew not whether she was ashore or afloat, so\r\nabsorbed was she in her despair.]\r\n\r\nThe good woman, seeing this, took pity upon her and brought her, by\r\ndint of entreaty, into a little hut of hers and there so humoured her\r\nthat she told her how she came thither; whereupon, seeing that she\r\nwas fasting, she set before her her own dry bread and somewhat of fish\r\nand water and so besought her that she ate a little. Costanza after\r\nasked her who she was that she spoke Latin thus; to which she answered\r\nthat she was from Trapani and was called Carapresa and served certain\r\nChristian fishermen there. The girl, hearing the name of Carapresa,\r\nalbeit she was exceeding woebegone and knew not what reason moved her\r\nthereunto, took it unto herself for a good augury to have heard this\r\nname[273] and began to hope, without knowing what, and somewhat to\r\nabate of her wish to die. Then, without discovering who or whence she\r\nwas, she earnestly besought the good woman to have pity, for the love\r\nof God, on her youth and give her some counsel how she might escape\r\nany affront being offered her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 273: Or \"augured well from the hearing of the name.\"\r\n_Carapresa_ signifies \"a dear or precious prize, gain or capture.\"]\r\n\r\nCarapresa, like a good woman as she was, hearing this, left her in her\r\nhut, whilst she hastily gathered up her nets; then, returning to her,\r\nshe wrapped her from head to foot in her own mantle and carried her to\r\nSusa, where she said to her, 'Costanza, I will bring thee into the\r\nhouse of a very good Saracen lady, whom I serve oftentimes in her\r\noccasions and who is old and pitiful. I will commend thee to her as\r\nmost I may and I am very certain that she will gladly receive thee and\r\nuse thee as a daughter; and do thou, abiding with her, study thine\r\nutmost, in serving her, to gain her favour, against God send thee\r\nbetter fortune.' And as she said, so she did. The lady, who was well\r\nstricken in years, hearing the woman's story, looked the girl in the\r\nface and fell a-weeping; then taking her by the hand, she kissed her\r\non the forehead and carried her into her house, where she and sundry\r\nother women abode, without any man, and wrought all with their hands\r\nat various crafts, doing divers works of silk and palm-fibre and\r\nleather. Costanza soon learned to do some of these and falling to\r\nworking with the rest, became in such favour with the lady and the\r\nothers that it was a marvellous thing; nor was it long before, with\r\ntheir teaching, she learnt their language.\r\n\r\nWhat while she abode thus at Susa, being now mourned at home for lost\r\nand dead, it befell that, one Mariabdela[274] being King of Tunis, a\r\ncertain youth of great family and much puissance in Granada, avouching\r\nthat that kingdom belonged to himself, levied a great multitude of\r\nfolk and came upon King Mariabdela, to oust him from the kingship.\r\nThis came to the ears of Martuccio Gomito in prison and he knowing the\r\nBarbary language excellent well and hearing that the king was making\r\ngreat efforts for his defence, said to one of those who had him and\r\nhis fellows in keeping, 'An I might have speech of the king, my heart\r\nassureth me that I could give him a counsel, by which he should gain\r\nthis his war.' The keeper reported these words to his chief, and he\r\ncarried them incontinent to the king, who bade fetch Martuccio and\r\nasked him what might be his counsel; whereto he made answer on this\r\nwise, 'My lord, if, what time I have otherwhiles frequented these your\r\ndominions, I have noted aright the order you keep in your battles,\r\nmeseemeth you wage them more with archers than with aught else;\r\nwherefore, if a means could be found whereby your adversary's bowmen\r\nshould lack of arrows, whilst your own had abundance thereof,\r\nmethinketh your battle would be won.' 'Without doubt,' answered the\r\nking, 'and this might be compassed, I should deem myself assured of\r\nvictory.' Whereupon, 'My lord,' quoth Martuccio, 'an you will, this\r\nmay very well be done, and you shall hear how. You must let make\r\nstrings for your archers' bows much thinner than those which are\r\neverywhere commonly used and after let make arrows, the notches\r\nwhereof shall not serve but for these thin strings. This must be so\r\nsecretly done that your adversary should know nought thereof; else\r\nwould he find a remedy therefor; and the reason for which I counsel\r\nyou thus is this. After your enemy's archers and your own shall have\r\nshot all their arrows, you know that, the battle lasting, it will\r\nbehove your foes to gather up the arrows shot by your men and the\r\nlatter in like manner to gather theirs; but the enemy will not be able\r\nto make use of your arrows, by reason of the strait notches which will\r\nnot take their thick strings, whereas the contrary will betide your\r\nmen of the enemy's arrows, for that the thin strings will excellently\r\nwell take the wide-notched arrows; and so your men will have abundance\r\nof ammunition, whilst the others will suffer default thereof.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 274: This name is apparently a distortion of the Arabic\r\n_Amir Abdullah_.]\r\n\r\nThe king, who was a wise prince, was pleased with Martuccio's counsel\r\nand punctually following it, found himself thereby to have won his\r\nwar. Wherefore Martuccio became in high favour with him and rose in\r\nconsequence to great and rich estate. The report of these things\r\nspread over the land and it came presently to Costanza's ears that\r\nMartuccio Gomito, whom she had long deemed dead, was alive, whereupon\r\nthe love of him, that was now grown cool in her heart, broke out of a\r\nsudden into fresh flame and waxed greater than ever, whilst dead hope\r\nrevived in her. Therewithal she altogether discovered her every\r\nadventure to the good lady, with whom she dwelt, and told her that she\r\nwould fain go to Tunis, so she might satisfy her eyes of that whereof\r\nher ears had made them desireful, through the reports received. The\r\nold lady greatly commended her purpose and taking ship with her,\r\ncarried her, as if she had been her mother, to Tunis, where they were\r\nhonourably entertained in the house of a kinswoman of hers. There she\r\ndespatched Carapresa, who had come with them, to see what she could\r\nlearn of Martuccio, and she, finding him alive and in great estate and\r\nreporting this to the old gentlewoman, it pleased the latter to will\r\nto be she who should signify unto Martuccio that his Costanza was come\r\nthither to him; wherefore, betaking herself one day whereas he was,\r\nshe said to him, 'Martuccio, there is come to my house a servant of\r\nthine from Lipari, who would fain speak with thee privily there;\r\nwherefore, not to trust to others, I have myself, at his desire, come\r\nto give thee notice thereof.' He thanked her and followed her to her\r\nhouse, where when Costanza saw him, she was like to die of gladness\r\nand unable to contain herself, ran straightway with open arms to\r\nthrow herself on his neck; then, embracing him, without availing to\r\nsay aught, she fell a-weeping tenderly, both for compassion of their\r\npast ill fortunes and for present gladness.\r\n\r\nMartuccio, seeing his mistress, abode awhile dumb for amazement, then\r\nsaid sighing, 'O my Costanza, art thou then yet alive? It is long\r\nsince I heard that thou wast lost; nor in our country was aught known\r\nof thee.' So saying, he embraced her, weeping, and kissed her\r\ntenderly. Costanza then related to him all that had befallen her and\r\nthe honourable treatment which she had received from the gentlewoman\r\nwith whom she dwelt; and Martuccio, after much discourse, taking leave\r\nof her, repaired to the king his master and told him all, to wit, his\r\nown adventures and those of the damsel, adding that, with his leave,\r\nhe meant to take her to wife, according to our law. The king marvelled\r\nat these things and sending for the damsel and hearing from her that\r\nit was even as Martuccio had avouched, said to her, 'Then hast thou\r\nright well earned him to husband.' Then, letting bring very great and\r\nmagnificent gifts, he gave part thereof to her and part to Martuccio,\r\ngranting them leave to do one with the other that which was most\r\npleasing unto each of them; whereupon Martuccio, having entreated the\r\ngentlewoman who had harboured Costanza with the utmost honour and\r\nthanked her for that which she had done to serve her and bestowed on\r\nher such gifts as sorted with her quality, commended her to God and\r\ntook leave of her, he and his mistress, not without many tears from\r\nthe latter. Then, with the king's leave, they embarked with Carapresa\r\non board a little ship and returned with a fair wind to Lipari, where\r\nso great was the rejoicing that it might never be told. There\r\nMartuccio took Costanza to wife and held great and goodly nuptials;\r\nafter which they long in peace and repose had enjoyment of their\r\nloves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Fifth]\r\n\r\n     PIETRO BOCCAMAZZA, FLEEING WITH AGNOLELLA, FALLETH AMONG\r\n     THIEVES; THE GIRL ESCAPETH THROUGH A WOOD AND IS LED [BY\r\n     FORTUNE] TO A CASTLE, WHILST PIETRO IS TAKEN BY THE THIEVES,\r\n     BUT PRESENTLY, ESCAPING FROM THEIR HANDS, WINNETH, AFTER\r\n     DIVERS ADVENTURES, TO THE CASTLE WHERE HIS MISTRESS IS AND\r\n     ESPOUSING HER, RETURNETH WITH HER TO ROME\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was none among all the company but commended Emilia's story,\r\nwhich the queen seeing to be finished, turned to Elisa and bade her\r\nfollow on. Accordingly, studious to obey, she began: \"There occurreth\r\nto my mind, charming ladies, an ill night passed by a pair of\r\nindiscreet young lovers; but, for that many happy days ensued thereon,\r\nit pleaseth me to tell the story, as one that conformeth to our\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\nThere was, a little while agone, at Rome,--once the head, as it is\r\nnowadays the tail of the world,[275]--a youth, called Pietro\r\nBoccamazza, of a very worshipful family among those of the city, who\r\nfell in love with a very fair and lovesome damsel called Agnolella,\r\nthe daughter of one Gigliuozzo Saullo, a plebeian, but very dear to\r\nthe Romans, and loving her, he contrived so to do that the girl began\r\nto love him no less than he loved her; whereupon, constrained by\r\nfervent love and himseeming he might no longer brook the cruel pain\r\nthat the desire he had of her gave him, he demanded her in marriage;\r\nwhich no sooner did his kinsfolk know than they all repaired to him\r\nand chid him sore for that which he would have done; and on the other\r\nhand they gave Gigliuozzo to understand that he should make no account\r\nof Pietro's words, for that, an he did this, they would never have him\r\nfor friend or kinsman. Pietro seeing that way barred whereby alone he\r\ndeemed he might avail to win to his desire, was like to die of\r\nchagrin, and had Gigliuozzo consented, he would have taken his\r\ndaughter to wife, in despite of all his kindred. However, he\r\ndetermined, an it liked the girl, to contrive to give effect to their\r\nwishes, and having assured himself, by means of an intermediary, that\r\nthis was agreeable to her, he agreed with her that she should flee\r\nwith him from Rome.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 275: Clement V. early in the fourteenth century removed the\r\nPapal See to Avignon, where it continued to be during the reigns of\r\nthe five succeeding Popes, Rome being in the meantime abandoned by the\r\nPapal Court, till Gregory XI, in the year 1376 again took up his\r\nresidence at the latter city. It is apparently to this circumstance\r\nthat Boccaccio alludes in the text.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, having taken order for this, Pietro arose very early one\r\nmorning and taking horse with the damsel, set out for Anagni, where he\r\nhad certain friends in whom he trusted greatly. They had no leisure to\r\nmake a wedding of it, for that they feared to be followed, but rode\r\non, devising of their love and now and again kissing one another. It\r\nchanced that, when they came mayhap eight miles from Rome, the way not\r\nbeing overwell known to Pietro, they took a path to the left, whereas\r\nthey should have kept to the right; and scarce had they ridden more\r\nthan two miles farther when they found themselves near a little\r\ncastle, wherefrom, as soon as they were seen, there issued suddenly a\r\ndozen footmen. The girl, espying these, whenas they were already close\r\nupon them, cried out, saying, 'Pietro, let us begone, for we are\r\nattacked'; then, turning her rouncey's head, as best she knew, towards\r\na great wood hard by, she clapped her spurs fast to his flank and held\r\non to the saddlebow, whereupon the nag, feeling himself goaded, bore\r\nher into the wood at a gallop.\r\n\r\nPietro, who went gazing more at her face than at the road, not having\r\nbecome so quickly aware as she of the new comers, was overtaken and\r\nseized by them, whilst he still looked, without yet perceiving them,\r\nto see whence they should come. They made him alight from his hackney\r\nand enquired who he was, which he having told, they proceeded to take\r\ncounsel together and said, 'This fellow is of the friends of our\r\nenemies; what else should we do but take from him these clothes and\r\nthis nag and string him up to one of yonder oaks, to spite the\r\nOrsini?' They all fell in with this counsel and bade Pietro put off\r\nhis clothes, which as he was in act to do, foreboding him by this of\r\nthe ill fate which awaited him, it chanced that an ambush of good\r\nfive-and-twenty footmen started suddenly out upon the others, crying,\r\n'Kill! Kill!' The rogues, taken by surprise, let Pietro be and turned\r\nto stand upon their defence, but, seeing themselves greatly\r\noutnumbered by their assailants, betook themselves to flight, whilst\r\nthe others pursued them.\r\n\r\nPietro, seeing this, hurriedly caught up his gear and springing on his\r\nhackney, addressed himself, as best he might, to flee by the way he\r\nhad seen his mistress take; but finding her not and seeing neither\r\nroad nor footpath in the wood neither perceiving any horse's hoof\r\nmarks, he was the woefullest man alive; and as soon as himseemed he\r\nwas safe and out of reach of those who had taken him, as well as of\r\nthe others by whom they had been assailed, he began to drive hither\r\nand thither about the wood, weeping and calling; but none answered him\r\nand he dared not turn back and knew not where he might come, an he\r\nwent forward, more by token that he was in fear of the wild beasts\r\nthat use to harbour in the woods, at once for himself and for his\r\nmistress, whom he looked momently to see strangled of some bear or\r\nsome wolf. On this wise, then, did the unlucky Pietro range all day\r\nabout the wood, crying and calling, whiles going backward, when as he\r\nthought to go forward, until, what with shouting and weeping and fear\r\nand long fasting, he was so spent that he could no more and seeing the\r\nnight come and knowing not what other course to take, he dismounted\r\nfrom his hackney and tied the latter to a great oak, into which he\r\nclimbed, so he might not be devoured of the wild beasts in the night.\r\nA little after the moon rose and the night being very clear and\r\nbright, he abode there on wake, sighing and weeping and cursing his\r\nill luck, for that he durst not go to sleep, lest he should fall,\r\nalbeit, had he had more commodity thereof, grief and the concern in\r\nwhich he was for his mistress would not have suffered him to sleep.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the damsel, fleeing, as we have before said, and knowing\r\nnot whither to betake herself, save whereas it seemed good to her\r\nhackney to carry her, fared on so far into the wood that she could not\r\nsee where she had entered, and went wandering all day about that\r\ndesert place, no otherwise than as Pietro had done, now pausing [to\r\nhearken] and now going on, weeping the while and calling and making\r\nmoan of her illhap. At last, seeing that Pietro came not and it being\r\nnow eventide, she happened on a little path, into which her hackney\r\nturned, and following it, after she had ridden some two or more miles\r\nshe saw a little house afar off. Thither she made her way as\r\nquickliest she might and found there a good man sore stricken in years\r\nand a woman, his wife alike old, who, seeing her alone, said to her,\r\n'Daughter, what dost thou alone at this hour in these parts?' The\r\ndamsel replied, weeping, that she had lost her company in the wood and\r\nenquired how near she was to Anagni. 'Daughter mine,' answered the\r\ngood man, 'this is not the way to go to Anagni; it is more than a\r\ndozen miles hence.' Quoth the girl, 'And how far is it hence to any\r\nhabitations where I may have a lodging for the night?' To which the\r\ngood man answered, 'There is none anywhere so near that thou mayst\r\ncome thither by daylight.' Then said the damsel, 'Since I can go no\r\notherwhere, will it please you harbour me here to-night for the love\r\nof God?' 'Young lady,' replied the old man, 'thou art very welcome to\r\nabide with us this night; algates, we must warn you that there are\r\nmany ill companies, both of friends and of foes that come and go about\r\nthese parts both by day and by night, who many a time do us sore annoy\r\nand great mischief; and if, by ill chance, thou being here, there come\r\nany of them and seeing thee, fair and young as thou art, should offer\r\nto do thee affront and shame, we could not avail to succour thee\r\ntherefrom. We deem it well to apprise thee of this, so that, an it\r\nbetide, thou mayst not be able to complain of us.'\r\n\r\nThe girl, seeing that it was late, albeit the old man's words\r\naffrighted her, said, 'An it please God, He will keep both you and me\r\nfrom that annoy; and even if it befall me, it were a much less evil to\r\nbe maltreated of men than to be mangled of the wild beasts in the\r\nwoods.' So saying, she alighted from the rouncey and entered the poor\r\nman's house, where she supped with him on such poor fare as they had\r\nand after, all clad as she was, cast herself, together with them, on a\r\nlittle bed of theirs. She gave not over sighing and bewailing her own\r\nmishap and that of Pietro all night, knowing not if she might hope\r\nother than ill of him; and when it drew near unto morning, she heard a\r\ngreat trampling of folk approaching, whereupon she arose and betaking\r\nherself to a great courtyard, that lay behind the little house, saw in\r\na corner a great heap of hay, in which she hid herself, so she might\r\nnot be so quickly found, if those folk should come thither. Hardly had\r\nshe made an end of hiding herself when these, who were a great company\r\nof ill knaves, came to the door of the little house and causing open\r\nto them, entered and found Agnolella's hackney yet all saddled and\r\nbridled; whereupon they asked who was there and the good man, not\r\nseeing the girl, answered, 'None is here save ourselves; but this\r\nrouncey, from whomsoever it may have escaped, came hither yestereve\r\nand we brought it into the house, lest the wolves should eat it.'\r\n'Then,' said the captain of the troop, 'since it hath none other\r\nmaster, it is fair prize for us.'\r\n\r\nThereupon they all dispersed about the little house and some went into\r\nthe courtyard, where, laying down their lances and targets, it chanced\r\nthat one of them, knowing not what else to do, cast his lance into the\r\nhay and came very near to slay the hidden girl and she to discover\r\nherself, for that the lance passed so close to her left breast that\r\nthe steel tore a part of her dress, wherefore she was like to utter a\r\ngreat cry, fearing to be wounded; but, remembering where she was, she\r\nabode still, all fear-stricken. Presently, the rogues, having dressed\r\nthe kids and other meat they had with them and eaten and drunken, went\r\noff, some hither and some thither, about their affairs, and carried\r\nwith them the girl's hackney. When they had gone some distance, the\r\ngood man asked his wife, 'What befell of our young woman, who came\r\nthither yestereve? I have seen nothing of her since we arose.' The\r\ngood wife replied that she knew not and went looking for her,\r\nwhereupon the girl, hearing that the rogues were gone, came forth of\r\nthe hay, to the no small contentment of her host, who, rejoiced to see\r\nthat she had not fallen into their hands, said to her, it now growing\r\nday, 'Now that the day cometh, we will, an it please thee, accompany\r\nthee to a castle five miles hence, where thou wilt be in safety; but\r\nneeds must thou go afoot, for yonder ill folk, that now departed\r\nhence, have carried off thy rouncey.' The girl concerned herself\r\nlittle about the nag, but besought them for God's sake to bring her to\r\nthe castle in question, whereupon they set out and came thither about\r\nhalf tierce.\r\n\r\nNow this castle belonged to one of the Orsini family, by name Lionello\r\ndi Campodifiore, and there by chance was his wife, a very pious and\r\ngood lady, who, seeing the girl, knew her forthright and received her\r\nwith joy and would fain know orderly how she came thither. Agnolella\r\ntold her all and the lady, who knew Pietro on like wise, as being a\r\nfriend of her husband's, was grieved for the ill chance that had\r\nbetided and hearing where he had been taken, doubted not but he was\r\ndead; wherefore she said to Agnolella, 'Since thou knowest not what is\r\ncome of Pietro, thou shalt abide here till such time as I shall have a\r\ncommodity to send thee safe to Rome.'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Pietro abode, as woebegone as could be, in the oak, and\r\ntowards the season of the first sleep, he saw a good score of wolves\r\nappear, which came all about his hackney, as soon as they saw him. The\r\nhorse, scenting them, tugged at his bridle, till he broke it, and\r\nwould have fled, but being surrounded and unable to escape, he\r\ndefended himself a great while with his teeth and his hoofs. At last,\r\nhowever, he was brought down and strangled and quickly disembowelled\r\nby the wolves, which took all their fill of his flesh and having\r\ndevoured him, made off, without leaving aught but the bones, whereat\r\nPietro, to whom it seemed he had in the rouncey a companion and a\r\nsupport in his troubles, was sore dismayed and misdoubted he should\r\nnever avail to win forth of the wood. However, towards daybreak, being\r\nperished with cold in the oak and looking still all about him, he\r\ncaught sight of a great fire before him, mayhap a mile off, wherefore,\r\nas soon as it was grown broad day, he came down from the oak, not\r\nwithout fear, and making for the fire, fared on till he came to the\r\nplace, where he found shepherds eating and making merry about it, by\r\nwhom he was received for compassion.\r\n\r\nAfter he had eaten and warmed himself, he acquainted them with his\r\nmisadventure and telling them how he came thither alone, asked them if\r\nthere was in those parts a village or castle, to which he might betake\r\nhimself. The shepherds answered that some three miles thence there was\r\na castle belonging to Lionello di Campodifiore, whose lady was\r\npresently there; whereat Pietro was much rejoiced and besought them\r\nthat one of them should accompany him to the castle, which two of them\r\nreadily did. There he found some who knew him and was in act to\r\nenquire for a means of having search made about the forest for the\r\ndamsel, when he was bidden to the lady's presence and incontinent\r\nrepaired to her. Never was joy like unto his, when he saw Agnolella\r\nwith her, and he was all consumed with desire to embrace her, but\r\nforbore of respect for the lady, and if he was glad, the girl's joy\r\nwas no less great. The gentle lady, having welcomed him and made much\r\nof him and heard from him what had betided him, chid him amain of that\r\nwhich he would have done against the will of his kinsfolk; but, seeing\r\nthat he was e'en resolved upon this and that it was agreeable to the\r\ngirl also, she said in herself, 'Why do I weary myself in vain? These\r\ntwo love and know each other and both are friends of my husband. Their\r\ndesire is an honourable one and meseemeth it is pleasing to God, since\r\nthe one of them hath scaped the gibbet and the other the lance-thrust\r\nand both the wild beasts of the wood; wherefore be it as they will.'\r\nThen, turning to the lovers, she said to them, 'If you have it still\r\nat heart to be man and wife, it is my pleasure also; be it so, and let\r\nthe nuptials be celebrated here at Lionello's expense. I will engage\r\nafter to make peace between you and your families.' Accordingly, they\r\nwere married then and there, to the great contentment of Pietro and\r\nthe yet greater satisfaction of Agnolella, and the gentle lady made\r\nthem honourable nuptials, in so far as might be in the mountains.\r\nThere, with the utmost delight, they enjoyed the first-fruits of their\r\nlove and a few days after, they took horse with the lady and returned,\r\nunder good escort, to Rome, where she found Pietro's kinsfolk sore\r\nincensed at that which he had done, but contrived to make his peace\r\nwith them, and he lived with his Agnolella in all peace and pleasance\r\nto a good old age.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Fifth]\r\n\r\n     RICCIARDO MANARDI, BEING FOUND BY MESSER LIZIO DA VALBONA\r\n     WITH HIS DAUGHTER, ESPOUSETH HER AND ABIDETH IN PEACE WITH\r\n     HER FATHER\r\n\r\n\r\nElisa holding her peace and hearkening to the praises bestowed by the\r\nladies her companions upon her story, the Queen charged Filostrato\r\ntell one of his own, whereupon he began, laughing, \"I have been so\r\noften rated by so many of you ladies for having imposed on you matter\r\nfor woeful discourse and such as tended to make you weep, that\r\nmethinketh I am beholden, an I would in some measure requite you that\r\nannoy, to relate somewhat whereby I may make you laugh a little; and I\r\nmean therefore to tell you, in a very short story, of a love that,\r\nafter no worse hindrance than sundry sighs and a brief fright, mingled\r\nwith shame, came to a happy issue.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, noble ladies, no great while ago since there lived in\r\nRomagna a gentleman of great worth and good breeding, called Messer\r\nLizio da Valbona, to whom, well nigh in his old age, it chanced there\r\nwas born of his wife, Madam Giacomina by name, a daughter, who grew up\r\nfair and agreeable beyond any other of the country; and for that she\r\nwas the only child that remained to her father and mother, they loved\r\nand tendered her exceeding dear and guarded her with marvellous\r\ndiligence, looking to make some great alliance by her. Now there was\r\na young man of the Manardi of Brettinoro, comely and lusty of his\r\nperson, by name Ricciardo, who much frequented Messer Lizio's house\r\nand conversed amain with him and of whom the latter and his lady took\r\nno more account than they would have taken of a son of theirs. Now,\r\nthis Ricciardo, looking once and again upon the young lady and seeing\r\nher very fair and sprightly and commendable of manners and fashions,\r\nfell desperately in love with her, but was very careful to keep his\r\nlove secret. The damsel presently became aware thereof and without\r\nanywise seeking to shun the stroke, began on like wise to love him;\r\nwhereat Ricciardo was mightily rejoiced. He had many a time a mind to\r\nspeak to her, but kept silence of misdoubtance; however, one day,\r\ntaking courage and opportunity, he said to her, 'I prithee, Caterina,\r\ncause me not die of love.' To which she straightway made answer,\r\n'Would God thou wouldst not cause _me_ die!'\r\n\r\nThis answer added much courage and pleasure to Ricciardo and he said\r\nto her, 'Never shall aught that may be agreeable to thee miscarry[276]\r\nfor me; but it resteth with thee to find a means of saving thy life\r\nand mine.' 'Ricciardo,' answered she, 'thou seest how straitly I am\r\nguarded; wherefore, for my part, I cannot see how thou mayst avail to\r\ncome at me; but, if thou canst see aught that I may do without shame\r\nto myself, tell it me and I will do it.' Ricciardo, having bethought\r\nhimself of sundry things, answered promptly, 'My sweet Caterina, I can\r\nsee no way, except that thou lie or make shift to come upon the\r\ngallery that adjoineth thy father's garden, where an I knew that thou\r\nwouldst be anights, I would without fail contrive to come to thee, how\r\nhigh soever it may be.' 'If thou have the heart to come thither,'\r\nrejoined Caterina, 'methinketh I can well enough win to be there.'\r\nRicciardo assented and they kissed each other once only in haste and\r\nwent their ways.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 276: Lit. stand (_stare_), _i.e._ abide undone.]\r\n\r\nNext day, it being then near the end of May, the girl began to\r\ncomplain before her mother that she had not been able to sleep that\r\nnight for the excessive heat. Quoth the lady, 'Of what heat dost thou\r\nspeak, daughter? Nay, it was nowise hot.' 'Mother mine,' answered\r\nCaterina, 'you should say \"To my seeming,\" and belike you would say\r\nsooth; but you should consider how much hotter are young girls than\r\nladies in years.' 'Daughter mine,' rejoined the lady, 'that is true;\r\nbut I cannot make it cold and hot at my pleasure, as belike thou\r\nwouldst have me do. We must put up with the weather, such as the\r\nseasons make it; maybe this next night will be cooler and thou wilt\r\nsleep better.' 'God grant it may be so!' cried Caterina. 'But it is\r\nnot usual for the nights to go cooling, as it groweth towards summer.'\r\n'Then what wouldst thou have done?' asked the mother; and she\r\nanswered, 'An it please my father and you, I would fain have a little\r\nbed made in the gallery, that is beside his chamber and over his\r\ngarden, and there sleep. There I should hear the nightingale sing and\r\nhaving a cooler place to lie in, I should fare much better than in\r\nyour chamber.' Quoth the mother, 'Daughter, comfort thyself; I will\r\ntell thy father, and as he will, so will we do.'\r\n\r\nMesser Lizio hearing all this from his wife, said, for that he was an\r\nold man and maybe therefore somewhat cross-grained, 'What nightingale\r\nis this to whose song she would sleep? I will yet make her sleep to\r\nthe chirp of the crickets.' Caterina, coming to know this, more of\r\ndespite than for the heat, not only slept not that night, but suffered\r\nnot her mother to sleep, still complaining of the great heat.\r\nAccordingly, next morning, the latter repaired to her husband and said\r\nto him, 'Sir, you have little tenderness for yonder girl; what\r\nmattereth it to you if she lie in the gallery? She could get no rest\r\nall night for the heat. Besides, can you wonder at her having a mind\r\nto hear the nightingale sing, seeing she is but a child? Young folk\r\nare curious of things like themselves. Messer Lizio, hearing this,\r\nsaid, 'Go to, make her a bed there, such as you think fit, and bind it\r\nabout with some curtain or other, and there let her lie and hear the\r\nnightingale sing to her heart's content.'\r\n\r\nThe girl, learning this, straightway let make a bed in the gallery and\r\nmeaning to lie there that same night, watched till she saw Ricciardo\r\nand made him a signal appointed between them, by which he understood\r\nwhat was to be done. Messer Lizio, hearing the girl gone to bed,\r\nlocked a door that led from his chamber into the gallery and betook\r\nhimself likewise to sleep. As for Ricciardo, as soon as he heard all\r\nquiet on every hand, he mounted a wall, with the aid of a ladder, and\r\nthence, laying hold of certain toothings of another wall, he made his\r\nway, with great toil and danger, if he had fallen, up to the gallery,\r\nwhere he was quietly received by the girl with the utmost joy. Then,\r\nafter many kisses, they went to bed together and took delight and\r\npleasure one of another well nigh all that night, making the\r\nnightingale sing many a time. The nights being short and the delight\r\ngreat and it being now, though they thought it not, near day, they\r\nfell asleep without any covering, so overheated were they what with\r\nthe weather and what with their sport, Caterina having her right arm\r\nentwined about Ricciardo's neck and holding him with the left hand by\r\nthat thing which you ladies think most shame to name among men.\r\n\r\nAs they slept on this wise, without awaking, the day came on and\r\nMesser Lizio arose and remembering him that his daughter lay in the\r\ngallery, opened the door softly, saying in himself, 'Let us see how\r\nthe nightingale hath made Caterina sleep this night.' Then, going in,\r\nhe softly lifted up the serge, wherewith the bed was curtained about,\r\nand saw his daughter and Ricciardo lying asleep, naked and uncovered,\r\nembraced as it hath before been set out; whereupon, having recognized\r\nRicciardo, he went out again and repairing to his wife's chamber,\r\ncalled to her, saying, 'Quick, wife, get thee up and come see, for\r\nthat thy daughter hath been so curious of the nightingale that she\r\nhath e'en taken it and hath it in hand.' 'How can that be?' quoth she;\r\nand he answered, 'Thou shalt see it, an thou come quickly.'\r\nAccordingly, she made haste to dress herself and quietly followed her\r\nhusband to the bed, where, the curtain being drawn, Madam Giacomina\r\nmight plainly see how her daughter had taken and held the\r\nnightingale, which she had so longed to hear sing; whereat the lady,\r\nholding herself sore deceived of Ricciardo, would have cried out and\r\nrailed at him; but Messer Lizio said to her, 'Wife, as thou holdest my\r\nlove dear, look thou say not a word, for, verily, since she hath\r\ngotten it, it shall be hers. Ricciardo is young and rich and gently\r\nborn; he cannot make us other than a good son-in-law. An he would part\r\nfrom me on good terms, needs must he first marry her, so it will be\r\nfound that he hath put the nightingale in his own cage and not in that\r\nof another.'\r\n\r\nThe lady was comforted to see that her husband was not angered at the\r\nmatter and considering that her daughter had passed a good night and\r\nrested well and had caught the nightingale, to boot, she held her\r\ntongue. Nor had they abidden long after these words when Ricciardo\r\nawoke and seeing that it was broad day, gave himself over for lost and\r\ncalled Caterina, saying, 'Alack, my soul, how shall we do, for the day\r\nis come and hath caught me here?' Whereupon Messer Lizio came forward\r\nand lifting the curtain, answered, 'We shall do well.' When Ricciardo\r\nsaw him, himseemed the heart was torn out of his body and sitting up\r\nin bed, he said, 'My lord, I crave your pardon for God's sake. I\r\nacknowledged to have deserved death, as a disloyal and wicked man;\r\nwherefore do you with me as best pleaseth you; but, I prithee, an it\r\nmay be, have mercy on my life and let me not die.' 'Ricciardo,'\r\nanswered Messer Lizio, 'the love that I bore thee and the faith I had\r\nin thee merited not this return; yet, since thus it is and youth hath\r\ncarried thee away into such a fault, do thou, to save thyself from\r\ndeath and me from shame, take Caterina to thy lawful wife, so that,\r\nlike as this night she hath been thine, she may e'en be thine so long\r\nas she shall live. On this wise thou mayst gain my pardon and thine\r\nown safety; but, an thou choose not to do this, commend thy soul to\r\nGod.'\r\n\r\nWhilst these words were saying, Caterina let go the nightingale and\r\ncovering herself, fell to weeping sore and beseeching her father to\r\npardon Ricciardo, whilst on the other hand she entreated her lover to\r\ndo as Messer Lizio wished, so they might long pass such nights\r\ntogether in security. But there needed not overmany prayers, for that,\r\non the one hand, shame of the fault committed and desire to make\r\namends for it, and on the other, the fear of death and the wish to\r\nescape,--to say nothing of his ardent love and longing to possess the\r\nthing beloved,--made Ricciardo freely and without hesitation avouch\r\nhimself ready to do that which pleased Messer Lizio; whereupon the\r\nlatter borrowed of Madam Giacomina one of her rings and there, without\r\nbudging, Ricciardo in their presence took Caterina to his wife. This\r\ndone, Messer Lizio and his lady departed, saying, 'Now rest\r\nyourselves, for belike you have more need thereof than of rising.'\r\nThey being gone, the young folk clipped each other anew and not having\r\nrun more than half a dozen courses overnight, they ran other twain ere\r\nthey arose and so made an end of the first day's tilting. Then they\r\narose and Ricciardo having had more orderly conference with Messer\r\nLizio, a few days after, as it beseemed, he married the damsel over\r\nagain, in the presence of their friends and kinsfolk, and brought her\r\nwith great pomp to his own house. There he held goodly and honourable\r\nnuptials and after went long nightingale-fowling with her to his\r\nheart's content, in peace and solace, both by night and by day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Fifth]\r\n\r\n     GUIDOTTO DA CREMONA LEAVETH TO GIACOMINO DA PAVIA A DAUGHTER\r\n     OF HIS AND DIETH. GIANNOLE DI SEVERINO AND MINGHINO DI\r\n     MINGOLE FALL IN LOVE WITH THE GIRL AT FAENZA AND COME TO\r\n     BLOWS ON HER ACCOUNT. ULTIMATELY SHE IS PROVED TO BE\r\n     GIANNOLE'S SISTER AND IS GIVEN TO MINGHINO TO WIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the ladies, hearkening to the story of the nightingale, had\r\nlaughed so much that, though Filostrato had made an end of telling,\r\nthey could not yet give over laughing. But, after they had laughed\r\nawhile, the queen said to Filostrato, \"Assuredly, if thou afflictedest\r\nus ladies yesterday, thou hast so tickled us to-day that none of us\r\ncan deservedly complain of thee.\" Then, addressing herself to Neifile,\r\nshe charged her tell, and she blithely began to speak thus: \"Since\r\nFilostrato, discoursing, hath entered into Romagna, it pleaseth me on\r\nlike wise to go ranging awhile therein with mine own story.\r\n\r\nI say, then, that there dwelt once in the city of Fano two Lombards,\r\nwhereof the one was called Guidotto da Cremona and the other Giacomino\r\nda Pavia, both men advanced in years, who had in their youth been well\r\nnigh always soldiers and engaged in deeds of arms. Guidotto, being at\r\nthe point of death and having nor son nor other kinsmen nor friend in\r\nwhom he trusted more than in Giacomino, left him a little daughter he\r\nhad, of maybe ten years of age, and all that he possessed in the\r\nworld, and after having bespoken him at length of his affairs, he\r\ndied. In those days it befell that the city of Faenza, which had been\r\nlong in war and ill case, was restored to somewhat better estate and\r\npermission to sojourn there was freely conceded to all who had a mind\r\nto return thither; wherefore Giacomino, who had abidden there\r\notherwhile and had a liking for the place, returned thither with all\r\nhis good and carried with him the girl left him by Guidotto, whom he\r\nloved and entreated as his own child.\r\n\r\nThe latter grew up and became as fair a damsel as any in the city, ay,\r\nand as virtuous and well bred as she was fair; wherefore she began to\r\nbe courted of many, but especially two very agreeable young men of\r\nequal worth and condition vowed her a very great love, insomuch that\r\nfor jealousy they came to hold each other in hate out of measure. They\r\nwere called, the one Giannole di Severino and the other Minghino di\r\nMingole; nor was there either of them but would gladly have taken the\r\nyoung lady, who was now fifteen years old, to wife, had it been\r\nsuffered of his kinsfolk; wherefore, seeing her denied to them on\r\nhonourable wise, each cast about to get her for himself as best he\r\nmight. Now Giacomino had in his house an old serving-wench and a\r\nserving-man, Crivello by name, a very merry and obliging person, with\r\nwhom Giannole clapped up a great acquaintance and to whom, whenas\r\nhimseemed time, he discovered his passion, praying him to be\r\nfavourable to him in his endeavour to obtain his desire and promising\r\nhim great things an he did this; whereto quoth Crivello, 'Look you, I\r\ncan do nought for thee in this matter other than that, when next\r\nGiacomino goeth abroad to supper, I will bring thee whereas she may\r\nbe; for that, an I offered to say a word to her in thy favour, she\r\nwould never stop to listen to me. If this like thee, I promise it to\r\nthee and will do it; and do thou after, an thou know how, that which\r\nthou deemest shall best serve thy purpose.' Giannole answered that he\r\ndesired nothing more and they abode on this understanding. Meanwhile\r\nMinghino, on his part, had suborned the maidservant and so wrought\r\nwith her that she had several times carried messages to the girl and\r\nhad well night inflamed her with love of him; besides which she had\r\npromised him to bring him in company with her, so soon as Giacomino\r\nshould chance to go abroad of an evening for whatever cause.\r\n\r\nNot long after this it chanced that, by Crivello's contrivance,\r\nGiacomino went to sup with a friend of his, whereupon Crivello gave\r\nGiannole to know thereof and appointed with him that, whenas he made a\r\ncertain signal, he should come and would find the door open. The maid,\r\non her side, knowing nothing of all this, let Minghino know that\r\nGiacomino was to sup abroad and bade him abide near the house, so\r\nthat, whenas he saw a signal which she should make he might come and\r\nenter therein. The evening come, the two lovers, knowing nothing of\r\neach other's designs, but each misdoubting of his rival, came, with\r\nsundry companions armed, to enter into possession. Minghino, with his\r\ntroop took up his quarters in the house of a friend of his, a\r\nneighbour of the young lady's; whilst Giannole and his friends\r\nstationed themselves at a little distance from the house. Meanwhile,\r\nCrivello and the maid, Giacomino being gone, studied each to send the\r\nother away. Quoth he to her, 'Why dost thou not get thee to bed? Why\r\ngoest thou still wandering about the house?' 'And thou,' retorted she,\r\n'why goest thou not for thy master? What awaitest thou here, now that\r\nthou hast supped?' And so neither could make other avoid the place;\r\nbut Crivello, seeing the hour come that he had appointed with Giannole\r\nsaid in himself, 'What reck I of her? An she abide not quiet, she is\r\nlike to smart for it.'\r\n\r\nAccordingly, giving the appointed signal, he went to open the door,\r\nwhereupon Giannole, coming up in haste with two companions, entered\r\nand finding the young lady in the saloon, laid hands on her to carry\r\nher off. The girl began to struggle and make a great outcry, as\r\nlikewise did the maid, which Minghino hearing, he ran thither with his\r\ncompanions and seeing the young lady being presently dragged out at\r\nthe door, they pulled out their swords and cried all, 'Ho, traitors,\r\nye are dead men! The thing shall not go thus. What is this violence?'\r\nSo saying, they fell to hewing at them, whilst the neighbors, issuing\r\nforth at the clamour with lights and arms, began to blame Giannole's\r\nbehaviour and to second Minghino; wherefore, after long contention,\r\nthe latter rescued the young lady from his rival and restored her to\r\nGiacomino's house. But, before the fray was over, up came the\r\ntown-captain's officers and arrested many of them; and amongst the\r\nrest Minghino and Giannole and Crivello were taken and carried off to\r\nprison. After matters were grown quiet again, Giacomino returned home\r\nand was sore chagrined at that which had happened; but, enquiring how\r\nit had come about and finding that the girl was nowise at fault, he\r\nwas somewhat appeased and determined in himself to marry her as\r\nquickliest he might, so the like should not again betide.\r\n\r\nNext morning, the kinsfolk of the two young men, hearing the truth of\r\nthe case and knowing the ill that might ensue thereof for the\r\nimprisoned youths, should Giacomino choose to do that which he\r\nreasonably might, repaired to him and prayed him with soft words to\r\nhave regard, not so much to the affront which he had suffered from the\r\nlittle sense of the young men as to the love and goodwill which they\r\nbelieved he bore to themselves who thus besought him, submitting\r\nthemselves and the young men who had done the mischief to any amends\r\nit should please him take. Giacomino, who had in his time seen many\r\nthings and was a man of sense, answered briefly, 'Gentlemen, were I in\r\nmine own country, as I am in yours, I hold myself so much your friend\r\nthat neither in this nor in otherwhat would I do aught save insomuch\r\nas it should please you; besides, I am the more bounden to comply with\r\nyour wishes in this matter, inasmuch as you have therein offended\r\nagainst yourselves, for that the girl in question is not, as belike\r\nmany suppose, of Cremona nor of Pavia; nay, she is a Faentine,[277]\r\nalbeit neither I nor she nor he of whom I had her might ever learn\r\nwhose daughter she was; wherefore, concerning that whereof you pray\r\nme, so much shall be done by me as you yourselves shall enjoin me.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 277: _i.e._ a native of Faenza (_Faentina_).]\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen, hearing this, marvelled and returning thanks to\r\nGiacomino for his gracious answer, prayed him that it would please him\r\ntell them how she came to his hands and how he knew her to be a\r\nFaentine; whereto quoth he, 'Guidotto da Cremona, who was my friend\r\nand comrade, told me, on his deathbed, that, when this city was taken\r\nby the Emperor Frederick and everything given up to pillage, he\r\nentered with his companions into a house and found it full of booty,\r\nbut deserted by its inhabitants, save only this girl, who was then\r\nsome two years old or thereabouts and who, seeing him mount the\r\nstairs, called him \"father\"; whereupon, taking compassion upon her, he\r\ncarried her off with him to Fano, together with all that was in the\r\nhouse, and dying there, left her to me with what he had, charging me\r\nmarry her in due time and give her to her dowry that which had been\r\nhers. Since she hath come to marriageable age, I have not yet found an\r\noccasion of marrying her to my liking, though I would gladly do it,\r\nrather than that another mischance like that of yesternight should\r\nbetide me on her account.'\r\n\r\nNow among the others there was a certain Guiglielmino da Medicina,\r\nwho had been with Guidotto in that affair[278] and knew very well\r\nwhose house it was that he had plundered, and he, seeing the person in\r\nquestion[279] there among the rest, accosted him, saying,\r\n'Bernabuccio, hearest thou what Giacomino saith?' 'Ay do I,' answered\r\nBernabuccio, 'and I was presently in thought thereof, more by token\r\nthat I mind me to have lost a little daughter of the age whereof\r\nGiacomino speaketh in those very troubles.' Quoth Guiglielmino, 'This\r\nis she for certain, for that I was once in company with Guidotto, when\r\nI heard him tell where he had done the plundering and knew it to be\r\nthy house that he had sacked; wherefore do thou bethink thee if thou\r\nmayst credibly recognize her by any token and let make search\r\ntherefor; for thou wilt assuredly find that she is thy daughter.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 278: _A questo fatto_, _i.e._ at the storm of Faenza.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 279: _i.e._ the owner of the plundered house.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Bernabuccio bethought himself and remembered that she\r\nshould have a little cross-shaped scar over her left ear, proceeding\r\nfrom a tumour, which he had caused cut for her no great while before\r\nthat occurrence; whereupon, without further delay, he accosted\r\nGiacomino, who was still there, and besought him to carry him to his\r\nhouse and let him see the damsel. To this he readily consented and\r\ncarrying him thither, let bring the girl before him. When Bernabuccio\r\nset eyes on her, himseemed he saw the very face of her mother, who was\r\nyet a handsome lady; nevertheless, not contenting himself with this,\r\nhe told Giacomino that he would fain of his favour have leave to raise\r\nher hair a little above her left ear, to which the other consented.\r\nAccordingly, going up to the girl, who stood shamefast, he lifted up\r\nher hair with his right hand and found the cross; whereupon, knowing\r\nher to be indeed his daughter, he fell to weeping tenderly and\r\nembracing her, notwithstanding her resistance; then, turning to\r\nGiacomino, 'Brother mine,' quoth he, 'this is my daughter; it was my\r\nhouse Guidotto plundered and this girl was, in the sudden alarm,\r\nforgotten there of my wife and her mother; and until now we believed\r\nthat she had perished with the house, which was burned me that same\r\nday.'\r\n\r\nThe girl, hearing this, and seeing him to be a man in years, gave\r\ncredence to his words and submitting herself to his embraces, as moved\r\nby some occult instinct, fell a-weeping tenderly with him. Bernabuccio\r\npresently sent for her mother and other her kinswomen and for her\r\nsisters and brothers and presented her to them all, recounting the\r\nmatter to them; then, after a thousand embraces, he carried her home\r\nto his house with the utmost rejoicing, to the great satisfaction of\r\nGiacomino. The town-captain, who was a man of worth, learning this and\r\nknowing that Giannole, whom he had in prison, was Bernabuccio's son\r\nand therefore the lady's own brother, determined indulgently to\r\noverpass the offence committed by him and released with him Minghino\r\nand Crivello and the others who were implicated in the affair.\r\nMoreover, he interceded with Bernabuccio and Giacomino concerning\r\nthese matters and making peace between the two young men, gave the\r\ngirl, whose name was Agnesa, to Minghino to wife, to the great\r\ncontentment of all their kinsfolk; whereupon Minghino, mightily\r\nrejoiced, made a great and goodly wedding and carrying her home, lived\r\nwith her many years after in peace and weal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Fifth]\r\n\r\n     GIANNI DI PROCIDA BEING FOUND WITH A YOUNG LADY, WHOM HE\r\n     LOVED AND WHO HAD BEEN GIVEN TO KING FREDERICK OF SICILY, IS\r\n     BOUND WITH HER TO A STAKE TO BE BURNT; BUT, BEING RECOGNIZED\r\n     BY RUGGIERI DELL' ORIA, ESCAPETH AND BECOMETH HER HUSBAND\r\n\r\n\r\nNeifile's story, which had much pleased the ladies, being ended, the\r\nqueen bade Pampinea address herself to tell another, and she\r\naccordingly, raising her bright face, began: \"Exceeding great,\r\ncharming ladies, is the might of Love and exposeth lovers to sore\r\ntravails, ay, and to excessive and unforeseen perils, as may be\r\ngathered from many a thing that hath been related both to-day and\r\notherwhiles; nevertheless, it pleaseth me yet again to demonstrate it\r\nto you with a story of an enamoured youth.\r\n\r\nIschia is an island very near Naples, and therein, among others, was\r\nonce a very fair and sprightly damsel, by name Restituta, who was the\r\ndaughter of a gentleman of the island called Marino Bolgaro and whom a\r\nyouth named Gianni, a native of a little island near Ischia, called\r\nProcida, loved more than his life, as she on like wise loved him. Not\r\nonly did he come by day from Procida to see her, but oftentimes\r\nanights, not finding a boat, he had swum from Procida to Ischia, at\r\nthe least to look upon the walls of her house, an he might no\r\notherwise. During the continuance of this so ardent love, it befell\r\nthat the girl, being all alone one summer day on the sea-shore,\r\nchanced, as she went from rock to rock, loosening shell-fish from the\r\nstones with a knife, upon a place hidden among the cliffs, where, at\r\nonce for shade and for the commodity of a spring of very cool water\r\nthat was there, certain young men of Sicily, coming from Naples, had\r\ntaken up their quarters with a pinnace they had. They, seeing that she\r\nwas alone and very handsome and was yet unaware of them, took counsel\r\ntogether to seize her and carry her off and put their resolve into\r\nexecution. Accordingly, they took her, for all she made a great\r\noutcry, and carrying her aboard the pinnace, made the best of their\r\nway to Calabria, where they fell to disputing of whose she should be.\r\nBrief, each would fain have her; wherefore, being unable to agree\r\namong themselves and fearing to come to worse and to mar their affairs\r\nfor her, they took counsel together to present her to Frederick, King\r\nof Sicily, who was then a young man and delighted in such toys.\r\nAccordingly, coming to Palermo, they made gift of the damsel to the\r\nking, who, seeing her to be fair, held her dear; but, for that he was\r\npresently somewhat infirm of his person, he commanded that, against he\r\nshould be stronger, she should be lodged in a very goodly pavilion,\r\nbelonging to a garden of his he called La Cuba, and there tended; and\r\nso it was done.\r\n\r\nGreat was the outcry in Ischia for the ravishment of the damsel and\r\nwhat most chagrined them was that they could not learn who they were\r\nthat had carried her off; but Gianni, whom the thing concerned more\r\nthan any other, not looking to get any news of this in Ischia and\r\nlearning in what direction the ravishers had gone, equipped another\r\npinnace and embarking therein, as quickliest as he might, scoured all\r\nthe coast from La Minerva to La Scalea in Calabria, enquiring\r\neverywhere for news of the girl. Being told at La Scalea that she had\r\nbeen carried off to Palermo by some Sicilian sailors, he betook\r\nhimself thither, as quickliest he might, and there, after much search,\r\nfinding that she had been presented to the king and was by him kept\r\nunder ward at La Cuba, he was sore chagrined and lost well nigh all\r\nhope, not only of ever having her again, but even of seeing her.\r\nNevertheless, detained by love, having sent away his pinnace and\r\nseeing that he was known of none there, he abode behind and passing\r\noften by La Cuba, he chanced one day to catch sight of her at a window\r\nand she saw him, to the great contentment of them both.\r\n\r\nGianni, seeing the place lonely, approached as most he might and\r\nbespeaking her, was instructed by her how he must do, an he would\r\nthereafterward have further speech of her. He then took leave of her,\r\nhaving first particularly examined the ordinance of the place in every\r\npart, and waited till a good part of the night was past, when he\r\nreturned thither and clambering up in places where a woodpecker had\r\nscarce found a foothold, he made his way into the garden. There he\r\nfound a long pole and setting it against the window which his mistress\r\nhad shown him, climbed up thereby lightly enough. The damsel,\r\nherseeming she had already lost her honour, for the preservation\r\nwhereof she had in times past been somewhat coy to him, thinking that\r\nshe could give herself to none more worthily than to him and doubting\r\nnot to be able to induce him to carry her off, had resolved in herself\r\nto comply with him in every his desire; wherefore she had left the\r\nwindow open, so he might enter forthright. Accordingly, Gianni,\r\nfinding it open, softly made his way into the chamber and laid himself\r\nbeside the girl, who slept not and who, before they came to otherwhat,\r\ndiscovered to him all her intent, instantly beseeching him to take her\r\nthence and carry her away. Gianni answered that nothing could be so\r\npleasing to him as this and promised that he would without fail, as\r\nsoon as he should have taken his leave of her, put the matter in train\r\non such wise that he might carry her away with him, the first time he\r\nreturned thither. Then, embracing each other with exceeding pleasure,\r\nthey took that delight beyond which Love can afford no greater, and\r\nafter reiterating it again and again, they fell asleep, without\r\nperceiving it, in each other's arms.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the king, who had at first sight been greatly taken with\r\nthe damsel, calling her to mind and feeling himself well of body,\r\ndetermined, albeit it was nigh upon day, to go and abide with her\r\nawhile. Accordingly, he betook himself privily to La Cuba with certain\r\nof his servants and entering the pavilion, caused softly open the\r\nchamber wherein he knew the girl slept. Then, with a great lighted\r\nflambeau before him, he entered therein and looking upon the bed, saw\r\nher and Gianni lying asleep and naked in each other's arms; whereas he\r\nwas of a sudden furiously incensed and flamed up into such a passion\r\nof wrath that it lacked of little but he had, without saying a word,\r\nslain them both then and there with a dagger he had by his side.\r\nHowever, esteeming it a very base thing of any man, much more a king,\r\nto slay two naked folk in their sleep, he contained himself and\r\ndetermined to put them to death in public and by fire; wherefore,\r\nturning to one only companion he had with him, he said to him, 'How\r\ndeemest thou of this vile woman, on whom I had set my hope?' And after\r\nhe asked him if he knew the young man who had dared enter his house to\r\ndo him such an affront and such an outrage; but he answered that he\r\nremembered not ever to have seen him. The king then departed the\r\nchamber, full of rage, and commanded that the two lovers should be\r\ntaken and bound, naked as they were, and that, as soon as it was broad\r\nday, they should be carried to Palermo and there bound to a stake,\r\nback to back, in the public place, where they should be kept till the\r\nhour of tierce, so they might be seen of all, and after burnt, even as\r\nthey had deserved; and this said, he returned to his palace at\r\nPalermo, exceeding wroth.\r\n\r\nThe king gone, there fell many upon the two lovers and not only\r\nawakened them, but forthright without any pity took them and bound\r\nthem; which when they saw, it may lightly be conceived if they were\r\nwoeful and feared for their lives and wept and made moan. According to\r\nthe king's commandment, they were carried to Palermo and bound to a\r\nstake in the public place, whilst the faggots and the fire were made\r\nready before their eyes, to burn them at the hour appointed. Thither\r\nstraightway flocked all the townsfolk, both men and women, to see the\r\ntwo lovers; the men all pressed to look upon the damsel and like as\r\nthey praised her for fair and well made in every part of her body,\r\neven so, on the other hand, the women, who all ran to gaze upon the\r\nyoung man, supremely commended him for handsome and well shapen. But\r\nthe wretched lovers, both sore ashamed, stood with bowed heads and\r\nbewailed their sorry fortune, hourly expecting the cruel death by\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nWhilst they were thus kept against the appointed hour, the default of\r\nthem committed, being bruited about everywhere, came to the ears of\r\nRuggieri dell' Oria, a man of inestimable worth and then the king's\r\nadmiral, whereupon he repaired to the place where they were bound and\r\nconsidering first the girl, commended her amain for beauty, then,\r\nturning to look upon the young man, knew him without much difficulty\r\nand drawing nearer to him, asked him if he were not Gianni di Procida.\r\nThe youth, raising his eyes and recognizing the admiral, answered, 'My\r\nlord, I was indeed he of whom you ask; but I am about to be no more.'\r\nThe admiral then asked him what had brought him to that pass, and he\r\nanswered, 'Love and the king's anger.' The admiral caused him tell his\r\nstory more at large and having heard everything from him as it had\r\nhappened, was about to depart, when Gianni called him back and said to\r\nhim, 'For God's sake, my lord, an it may be, get me one favour of him\r\nwho maketh me to abide thus.' 'What is that?' asked Ruggieri; and\r\nGianni said, 'I see I must die, and that speedily, and I ask,\r\ntherefore, by way of favour,--as I am bound with my back to this\r\ndamsel, whom I have loved more than my life, even as she hath loved\r\nme, and she with her back to me,--that we may be turned about with our\r\nfaces one to the other, so that, dying, I may look upon her face and\r\nget me gone, comforted.' 'With all my heart,' answered Ruggieri,\r\nlaughing; 'I will do on such wise that thou shalt yet see her till\r\nthou grow weary of her sight.'\r\n\r\nThen, taking leave of him, he charged those who were appointed to\r\ncarry the sentence into execution that they should proceed no farther\r\ntherein, without other commandment of the king, and straightway betook\r\nhimself to the latter, to whom, albeit he saw him sore incensed, he\r\nspared not to speak his mind, saying, 'King, in what have the two\r\nyoung folk offended against thee, whom thou hast commanded to be\r\nburned yonder in the public place?' The king told him and Ruggieri\r\nwent on, 'The offence committed by them deserveth it indeed, but not\r\nfrom thee; for, like as defaults merit punishment, even so do good\r\noffices merit recompense, let alone grace and clemency. Knowest thou\r\nwho these are thou wouldst have burnt?' The king answered no, and\r\nRuggieri continued, 'Then I will have thee know them, so thou mayst\r\nsee how discreetly[280] thou sufferest thyself to be carried away by\r\nthe transports of passion. The young man is the son of Landolfo di\r\nProcida, own brother to Messer Gian di Procida,[281] by whose means\r\nthou art king and lord of this island, and the damsel is the daughter\r\nof Marino Bolgaro, to whose influence thou owest it that thine\r\nofficers have not been driven forth of Ischia. Moreover, they are\r\nlovers who have long loved one another and constrained of love, rather\r\nthan of will to do despite to thine authority, have done this sin, if\r\nthat can be called sin which young folk do for love. Wherefore, then,\r\nwilt thou put them to death, whenas thou shouldst rather honour them\r\nwith the greatest favours and boons at thy commandment?'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 280: Iron., meaning \"with how little discretion.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 281: Gianni (Giovanni) di Procida was a Sicilian noble, to\r\nwhose efforts in stirring up the island to revolt against Charles of\r\nAnjou was mainly due the popular rising known as the Sicilian Vespers\r\n(A.D. 1283) which expelled the French usurper from Sicily and\r\ntransferred the crown to the house of Arragon. The Frederick (A.D.\r\n1296-1337) named in the text was the fourth prince of the latter\r\ndynasty.]\r\n\r\nThe king, hearing this and certifying himself that Ruggieri spoke\r\nsooth, not only forbore from proceeding to do worse, but repented him\r\nof that which he had done, wherefore he commanded incontinent that the\r\ntwo lovers should be loosed from the stake and brought before him;\r\nwhich was forthright done. Therewith, having fully acquainted himself\r\nwith their case, he concluded that it behoved him requite them the\r\ninjury he had done them with gifts and honour; wherefore he let clothe\r\nthem anew on sumptuous wise and finding them of one accord, caused\r\nGianni to take the damsel to wife. Then, making them magnificent\r\npresents, he sent them back, rejoicing, to their own country, where\r\nthey were received with the utmost joyance and delight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Fifth]\r\n\r\n     TEODORO, BEING ENAMOURED OF VIOLANTE, DAUGHTER OF MESSER\r\n     AMERIGO HIS LORD, GETTETH HER WITH CHILD AND IS CONDEMNED TO\r\n     BE HANGED; BUT, BEING RECOGNIZED AND DELIVERED BY HIS\r\n     FATHER, AS THEY ARE LEADING HIM TO THE GALLOWS, SCOURGING\r\n     HIM THE WHILE, HE TAKETH VIOLANTE TO WIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ladies, who abode all fearful in suspense to know if the lovers\r\nshould be burnt, hearing of their escape, praised God and were glad;\r\nwhereupon the queen, seeing that Pampinea had made an end of her\r\nstory, imposed on Lauretta the charge of following on, who blithely\r\nproceeded to say: \"Fairest ladies, in the days when good King\r\nWilliam[282] ruled over Sicily, there was in that island a gentleman\r\nhight Messer Amerigo Abate of Trapani, who, among other worldly goods,\r\nwas very well furnished with children; wherefore, having occasion for\r\nservants and there coming thither from the Levant certain galleys of\r\nGenoese corsairs, who had, in their cruises off the coast of Armenia,\r\ntaken many boys, he bought some of these latter, deeming them Turks,\r\nand amongst them one, Teodoro by name, of nobler mien and better\r\nbearing than the rest, who seemed all mere shepherds. Teodoro,\r\nalthough entreated as a slave, was brought up in the house with Messer\r\nAmerigo's children and conforming more to his own nature than to the\r\naccidents of fortune, approved himself so accomplished and well-bred\r\nand so commended himself to Messer Amerigo that he set him free and\r\nstill believing him to be a Turk, caused baptize him and call him\r\nPietro and made him chief over all his affairs, trusting greatly in\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 282: William II. (A.D. 1166-1189), the last (legitimate)\r\nking of the Norman dynasty in Sicily, called the Good, to distinguish\r\nhim from his father, William the Bad.]\r\n\r\nAs Messer Amerigo's children grew up, there grew up with them a\r\ndaughter of his, called Violante, a fair and dainty damsel, who, her\r\nfather tarrying overmuch to marry her, became by chance enamoured of\r\nPietro and loving him and holding his manners and fashions in great\r\nesteem, was yet ashamed to discover this to him. But Love spared her\r\nthat pains, for that Pietro, having once and again looked upon her by\r\nstealth, had become so passionately enamoured of her that he never\r\nknew ease save whenas he saw her; but he was sore afraid lest any\r\nshould become aware thereof, himseeming that in this he did other than\r\nwell. The young lady, who took pleasure in looking upon him, soon\r\nperceived this and to give him more assurance, showed herself\r\nexceeding well pleased therewith, as indeed she was. On this wise they\r\nabode a great while, daring not to say aught to one another, much as\r\neach desired it; but, whilst both, alike enamoured, languished\r\nenkindled in the flames of love, fortune, as if it had determined of\r\nwill aforethought that this should be, furnished them with an occasion\r\nof doing away the timorousness that baulked them.\r\n\r\nMesser Amerigo had, about a mile from Trapani, a very goodly\r\nplace,[283] to which his lady was wont ofttimes to resort by way of\r\npastime with her daughter and other women and ladies. Thither\r\naccordingly they betook themselves one day of great heat, carrying\r\nPietro with them, and there abiding, it befell, as whiles we see it\r\nhappen in summer time, that the sky became of a sudden overcast with\r\ndark clouds, wherefore the lady set out with her company to return to\r\nTrapani, so they might not be there overtaken of the foul weather, and\r\nfared on as fast as they might. But Pietro and Violante, being young,\r\noutwent her mother and the rest by a great way, urged belike, no less\r\nby love than by fear of the weather, and they being already so far in\r\nadvance that they were hardly to be seen, it chanced that, of a\r\nsudden, after many thunderclaps, a very heavy and thick shower of hail\r\nbegan to fall, wherefrom the lady and her company fled into the house\r\nof a husbandman.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 283: Apparently a pleasure-garden, without a house attached\r\nin which they might have taken shelter from the rain.]\r\n\r\nPietro and the young lady, having no readier shelter, took refuge in a\r\nlittle old hut, well nigh all in ruins, wherein none dwelt, and there\r\nhuddled together under a small piece of roof, that yet remained whole.\r\nThe scantness of the cover constrained them to press close one to\r\nother, and this touching was the means of somewhat emboldening their\r\nminds to discover the amorous desires that consumed them both; and\r\nPietro first began to say, 'Would God this hail might never give over,\r\nso but I might abide as I am!' 'Indeed,' answered the girl, 'that were\r\ndear to me also.' From these words they came to taking each other by\r\nthe hands and pressing them and from that to clipping and after to\r\nkissing, it hailing still the while; and in short, not to recount\r\nevery particular, the weather mended not before they had known the\r\nutmost delights of love and had taken order to have their pleasure\r\nsecretly one of the other. The storm ended, they fared on to the gate\r\nof the city, which was near at hand, and there awaiting the lady,\r\nreturned home with her.\r\n\r\nThereafter, with very discreet and secret ordinance, they foregathered\r\nagain and again in the same place, to the great contentment of them\r\nboth, and the work went on so briskly that the young lady became with\r\nchild, which was sore unwelcome both to the one and the other;\r\nwherefore she used many arts to rid herself, contrary to the course of\r\nnature, of her burden, but could nowise avail to accomplish it.\r\nTherewithal, Pietro, fearing for his life, bethought himself to flee\r\nand told her, to which she answered, 'An thou depart, I will without\r\nfail kill myself.' Whereupon quoth Pietro, who loved her exceedingly,\r\n'Lady mine, how wilt thou have me abide here? Thy pregnancy will\r\ndiscover our default and it will lightly be pardoned unto thee; but I,\r\npoor wretch, it will be must needs bear the penalty of thy sin and\r\nmine own.' 'Pietro,' replied she, 'my sin must indeed be discovered;\r\nbut be assured that thine will never be known, an thou tell not\r\nthyself.' Then said he, 'Since thou promisest me this, I will remain;\r\nbut look thou keep thy promise to me.'\r\n\r\nAfter awhile, the young lady, who had as most she might, concealed her\r\nbeing with child, seeing that, for the waxing of her body, she might\r\nno longer dissemble it, one day discovered her case to her mother,\r\nbeseeching her with many tears to save her; whereupon the lady, beyond\r\nmeasure woeful, gave her hard words galore and would know of her how\r\nthe thing had come about. Violante, in order that no harm might come\r\nto Pietro, told her a story of her own devising, disguising the truth\r\nin other forms. The lady believed it and to conceal her daughter's\r\ndefault, sent her away to a country house of theirs. There, the time\r\nof her delivery coming and the girl crying out, as women use to do,\r\nwhat while her mother never dreamed that Messer Amerigo, who was well\r\nnigh never wont to do so, should come thither, it chanced that he\r\npassed, on his return from hawking, by the chamber where his daughter\r\nlay and marvelling at the outcry she made, suddenly entered the\r\nchamber and demanded what was to do. The lady, seeing her husband come\r\nunawares, started up all woebegone and told him that which had\r\nbefallen the girl. But he, less easy of belief than his wife had been,\r\ndeclared that it could not be true that she knew not by whom she was\r\nwith child and would altogether know who he was, adding that, by\r\nconfessing it, she might regain his favour; else must she make ready\r\nto die without mercy.\r\n\r\nThe lady did her utmost to persuade her husband to abide content with\r\nthat which she had said; but to no purpose. He flew out into a passion\r\nand running, with his naked sword in his hand, at his daughter, who,\r\nwhat while her mother held her father in parley, had given birth to a\r\nmale child, said, 'Either do thou discover by whom the child was\r\nbegotten, or thou shalt die without delay.' The girl, fearing death,\r\nbroke her promise to Pietro and discovered all that had passed between\r\nhim and her; which when the gentleman heard, he fell into a fury of\r\nanger and hardly withheld himself from slaying her.\r\n\r\nHowever, after he had said to her that which his rage dictated to him,\r\nhe took horse again and returning to Trapani, recounted the affront\r\nthat Pietro had done him to a certain Messer Currado, who was captain\r\nthere for the king. The latter caused forthright seize Pietro, who was\r\noff his guard, and put him to the torture, whereupon he confessed all\r\nand being a few days after sentenced by the captain to be flogged\r\nthrough the city and after strung up by the neck, Messer Amerigo\r\n(whose wrath had not been done away by the having brought Pietro to\r\ndeath,) in order that one and the same hour should rid the earth of\r\nthe two lovers and their child, put poison in a hanap with wine and\r\ndelivering it, together with a naked poniard, to a serving-man of his,\r\nsaid to him, 'Carry these two things to Violante and bid her, on my\r\npart, forthright take which she will of these two deaths, poison or\r\nsteel; else will I have her burned alive, even as she hath deserved,\r\nin the presence of as many townsfolk as be here. This done, thou shalt\r\ntake the child, a few days agone born of her, and dash its head\r\nagainst the wall and after cast it to the dogs to eat.' This barbarous\r\nsentence passed by the cruel father upon his daughter and his\r\ngrandchild, the servant, who was more disposed to ill than to good,\r\nwent off upon his errand.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Pietro, as he was carried to the gallows by the officers,\r\nbeing scourged of them the while, passed, according as it pleased\r\nthose who led the company, before a hostelry wherein were three\r\nnoblemen of Armenia, who had been sent by the king of that country\r\nambassadors to Rome, to treat with the Pope of certain matters of\r\ngreat moment, concerning a crusade that was about to be undertaken,\r\nand who had lighted down there to take some days' rest and\r\nrefreshment. They had been much honoured by the noblemen of Trapani\r\nand especially by Messer Amerigo, and hearing those pass who led\r\nPietro, they came to a window to see. Now Pietro was all naked to the\r\nwaist, with his hands bounden behind his back, and one of the three\r\nambassadors, a man of great age and authority, named Fineo, espied on\r\nhis breast a great vermeil spot, not painted, but naturally imprinted\r\non his skin, after the fashion of what women here call _roses_. Seeing\r\nthis, there suddenly recurred to his memory a son of his who had been\r\ncarried off by corsairs fifteen years agone upon the coast of Lazistan\r\nand of whom he had never since been able to learn any news; and\r\nconsidering the age of the poor wretch who was scourged, he bethought\r\nhimself that, if his son were alive, he must be of such an age as\r\nPietro appeared to him. Wherefore he began to suspect by that token\r\nthat it must be he and bethought himself that, were he indeed his son,\r\nhe should still remember him of his name and that of his father and of\r\nthe Armenian tongue. Accordingly, as he drew near, he called out,\r\nsaying, 'Ho, Teodoro!' Pietro, hearing this, straightway lifted up his\r\nhead and Fineo, speaking in Armenian, said to him, 'What countryman\r\nart thou and whose son?' The sergeants who had him in charge halted\r\nwith him, of respect for the nobleman, so that Pietro answered,\r\nsaying, 'I was of Armenia and son to one Fineo and was brought hither,\r\nas a little child, by I know not what folk.'\r\n\r\nFineo, hearing this, knew him for certain to be the son whom he had\r\nlost, wherefore he came down, weeping, with his companions, and ran to\r\nembrace him among all the sergeants; then, casting over his shoulders\r\na mantle of the richest silk, which he had on his own back, he\r\nbesought the officer who was escorting him to execution to be pleased\r\nto wait there till such time as commandment should come to him to\r\ncarry the prisoner back; to which he answered that he would well. Now\r\nFineo had already learned the reason for which Pietro was being led to\r\ndeath, report having noised it abroad everywhere; wherefore he\r\nstraightway betook himself, with his companions and their retinue, to\r\nMesser Currado and bespoke him thus: 'Sir, he whom you have doomed to\r\ndie, as a slave, is a free man and my son and is ready to take to\r\nwife her whom it is said he hath bereft of her maidenhead; wherefore\r\nmay it please you to defer the execution till such time as it may be\r\nlearned if she will have him to husband, so, in case she be willing,\r\nyou may not be found to have done contrary to the law.' Messer\r\nCurrado, hearing that the condemned man was Fineo's son, marvelled and\r\nconfessing that which the latter said to be true, was somewhat ashamed\r\nof the unright of fortune and straightway caused carry Pietro home;\r\nthen, sending for Messer Amerigo, he acquainted him with these things.\r\n\r\nMesser Amerigo, who by this believed his daughter and grandson to be\r\ndead, was the woefullest man in the world for that which he had done,\r\nseeing that all might very well have been set right, so but Violante\r\nwere yet alive. Nevertheless, he despatched a runner whereas his\r\ndaughter was, to the intent that, in case his commandment had not been\r\ndone, it should not be carried into effect. The messenger found the\r\nservant sent by Messer Amerigo rating the lady, before whom he had\r\nlaid the poniard and the poison, for that she made not her election as\r\nspeedily [as he desired], and would have constrained her to take the\r\none or the other. But, hearing his lord's commandment, he let her be\r\nand returning to Messer Amerigo, told him how the case stood, to the\r\ngreat satisfaction of the latter, who, betaking himself whereas Fineo\r\nwas, excused himself, well nigh with tears, as best he knew, of that\r\nwhich had passed, craving pardon therefor and evouching that, an\r\nTeodoro would have his daughter to wife, he was exceeding well pleased\r\nto give her to him. Fineo gladly received his excuses and answered,\r\n'It is my intent that my son shall take your daughter to wife; and if\r\nhe will not, let the sentence passed upon him take its course.'\r\n\r\nAccordingly, being thus agreed, they both repaired whereas Teodoro\r\nabode yet all fearful of death, albeit he was rejoiced to have found\r\nhis father again, and questioned him of his mind concerning this\r\nthing. When he heard that, an he would, he might have Violante to\r\nwife, such was his joy that himseemed he had won from hell to heaven\r\nat one bound, and he answered that this would be to him the utmost of\r\nfavours, so but it pleased both of them. Thereupon they sent to know\r\nthe mind of the young lady, who, whereas she abode in expectation of\r\ndeath, the woefullest woman alive, hearing that which had betided and\r\nwas like to betide Teodoro, after much parley, began to lend some\r\nfaith to their words and taking a little comfort, answered that, were\r\nshe to ensue her own wishes in the matter, no greater happiness could\r\nbetide her than to be the wife of Teodoro; algates, she would do that\r\nwhich her father should command her.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, all parties being of accord, the two lovers were married\r\nwith the utmost magnificence, to the exceeding satisfaction of all the\r\ntownsfolk; and the young lady, heartening herself and letting rear her\r\nlittle son, became ere long fairer than ever. Then, being risen from\r\nchildbed, she went out to meet Fineo, whose return was expected from\r\nRome, and paid him reverence as to a father; whereupon he, exceeding\r\nwell pleased to have so fair a daughter-in-law, caused celebrate their\r\nnuptials with the utmost pomp and rejoicing and receiving her as a\r\ndaughter, ever after held her such. And after some days, taking ship\r\nwith his son and her and his little grandson, he carried them with him\r\ninto Lazistan, where the two lovers abode in peace and happiness, so\r\nlong as life endured unto them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Fifth]\r\n\r\n     NASTAGIO DEGLI ONESTI, FALLING IN LOVE WITH A LADY OF THE\r\n     TRAVERSARI FAMILY, SPENDETH HIS SUBSTANCE WITHOUT BEING\r\n     BELOVED IN RETURN, AND BETAKING HIMSELF, AT THE INSTANCE OF\r\n     HIS KINSFOLK, TO CHIASSI, HE THERE SEETH A HORSEMAN GIVE\r\n     CHASE TO A DAMSEL AND SLAY HER AND CAUSE HER BE DEVOURED OF\r\n     TWO DOGS. THEREWITHAL HE BIDDETH HIS KINSFOLK AND THE LADY\r\n     WHOM HE LOVETH TO A DINNER, WHERE HIS MISTRESS SEETH THE\r\n     SAME DAMSEL TORN IN PIECES AND FEARING A LIKE FATE, TAKETH\r\n     NASTAGIO TO HUSBAND\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sooner was Lauretta silent than Filomena, by the queen's\r\ncommandment, began thus: \"Lovesome ladies, even as pity is in us\r\ncommended, so also is cruelty rigorously avenged by Divine justice;\r\nthe which that I may prove to you and so engage you altogether to\r\npurge yourselves therefrom, it pleaseth me tell you a story no less\r\npitiful than delectable.\r\n\r\nIn Ravenna, a very ancient city of Romagna, there were aforetime many\r\nnoblemen and gentlemen, and amongst the rest a young man called\r\nNastagio degli Onesti, who had, by the death of his father and an\r\nuncle of his, been left rich beyond all estimation and who, as it\r\nhappeneth often with young men, being without a wife, fell in love\r\nwith a daughter of Messer Paolo Traversari, a young lady of much\r\ngreater family than his own, hoping by his fashions to bring her to\r\nlove him in return. But these, though great and goodly and\r\ncommendable, not only profited him nothing; nay, it seemed they did\r\nhim harm, so cruel and obdurate and intractable did the beloved damsel\r\nshow herself to him, being grown belike, whether for her singular\r\nbeauty or the nobility of her birth, so proud and disdainful that\r\nneither he nor aught that pleased him pleased her. This was so\r\ngrievous to Nastagio to bear that many a time, for chagrin, being\r\nweary of complaining, he had it in his thought to kill himself, but\r\nheld his hand therefrom; and again and again he took it to heart to\r\nlet her be altogether or have her, an he might, in hatred, even as she\r\nhad him. But in vain did he take such a resolve, for that, the more\r\nhope failed him, the more it seemed his love redoubled. Accordingly,\r\nhe persisted both in loving and in spending without stint or measure,\r\ntill it seemed to certain of his friends and kinsfolk that he was like\r\nto consume both himself and his substance; wherefore they besought him\r\nagain and again and counselled him depart Ravenna and go sojourn\r\nawhile in some other place, for that, so doing, he would abate both\r\nhis passion and his expenditure. Nastagio long made light of this\r\ncounsel, but, at last, being importuned of them and able no longer to\r\nsay no, he promised to do as they would have him and let make great\r\npreparations, as he would go into France or Spain or some other far\r\nplace. Then, taking horse in company with many of his friends, he rode\r\nout of Ravenna and betook himself to a place called Chiassi, some\r\nthree miles from the city, where, sending for tents and pavilions, he\r\ntold those who had accompanied him thither that he meant to abide and\r\nthat they might return to Ravenna. Accordingly, having encamped there,\r\nhe proceeded to lead the goodliest and most magnificent life that was\r\naye, inviting now these, now those others, to supper and to dinner, as\r\nhe was used.\r\n\r\nIt chanced one day, he being come thus well nigh to the beginning of\r\nMay and the weather being very fair, that, having entered into thought\r\nof his cruel mistress, he bade all his servants leave him to himself,\r\nso he might muse more at his leisure, and wandered on, step by step,\r\nlost in melancholy thought, till he came [unwillingly] into the\r\npine-wood. The fifth hour of the day was well nigh past and he had\r\ngone a good half mile into the wood, remembering him neither of eating\r\nnor of aught else, when himseemed of a sudden he heard a terrible\r\ngreat wailing and loud cries uttered by a woman; whereupon, his dulcet\r\nmeditation being broken, he raised his head to see what was to do and\r\nmarvelled to find himself among the pines; then, looking before him,\r\nhe saw a very fair damsel come running, naked through a thicket all\r\nthronged with underwood and briers, towards the place where he was,\r\nweeping and crying sore for mercy and all dishevelled and torn by the\r\nbushes and the brambles. At her heels ran two huge and fierce\r\nmastiffs, which followed hard upon her and ofttimes bit her cruelly,\r\nwhenas they overtook her; and after them he saw come riding upon a\r\nblack courser a knight arrayed in sad-coloured armour, with a very\r\nwrathful aspect and a tuck in his hand, threatening her with death in\r\nfoul and fearsome words.\r\n\r\nThis sight filled Nastagio's mind at once with terror and amazement\r\nand after stirred him to compassion of the ill-fortuned lady,\r\nwherefrom arose a desire to deliver her, an but he might, from such\r\nanguish and death. Finding himself without arms, he ran to take the\r\nbranch of a tree for a club, armed wherewith, he advanced to meet the\r\ndogs and the knight. When the latter saw this, he cried out to him\r\nfrom afar off, saying, 'Nastagio, meddle not; suffer the dogs and\r\nmyself to do that which this wicked woman hath merited.' As he spoke,\r\nthe dogs, laying fast hold of the damsel by the flanks, brought her to\r\na stand and the knight, coming up, lighted down from his horse;\r\nwhereupon Nastagio drew near unto him and said, 'I know not who thou\r\nmayst be, that knowest me so well; but this much I say to see that it\r\nis a great felony for an armed knight to seek to slay a naked woman\r\nand to set the dogs on her, as she were a wild beast; certes, I will\r\ndefend her as most I may.'\r\n\r\n'Nastagio,' answered the knight, 'I was of one same city with thyself\r\nand thou wast yet a little child when I, who hight Messer Guido degli\r\nAnastagi, was yet more passionately enamoured of this woman than thou\r\nart presently of yonder one of the Traversari and my ill fortune for\r\nher hard-heartedness and barbarity came to such a pass that one day I\r\nslew myself in despair with this tuck thou seest in my hand and was\r\ndoomed to eternal punishment. Nor was it long ere she, who was beyond\r\nmeasure rejoiced at my death, died also and for the sin of her cruelty\r\nand of the delight had of her in my torments (whereof she repented her\r\nnot, as one who thought not to have sinned therein, but rather to have\r\nmerited reward,) was and is on like wise condemned to the pains of\r\nhell. Wherein no sooner was she descended than it was decreed unto her\r\nand to me, for penance thereof,[284] that she should flee before me\r\nand that I, who once loved her so dear, should pursue her, not as a\r\nbeloved mistress, but as a mortal enemy, and that, as often as I\r\novertook her, I should slay her with this tuck, wherewith I slew\r\nmyself, and ripping open her loins, tear from her body, as thou shalt\r\npresently see, that hard and cold heart, wherein nor love nor pity\r\nmight ever avail to enter, together with the other entrails, and give\r\nthem to the dogs to eat. Nor is it a great while after ere, as God's\r\njustice and puissance will it, she riseth up again, as she had not\r\nbeen dead, and beginneth anew her woeful flight, whilst the dogs and I\r\nagain pursue her. And every Friday it betideth that I come up with her\r\nhere at this hour and wreak on her the slaughter that thou shalt see;\r\nand think not that we rest the other days; nay, I overtake her in\r\nother places, wherein she thought and wrought cruelly against me.\r\nThus, being as thou seest, from her lover grown her foe, it behoveth\r\nme pursue her on this wise as many years as she was cruel to me\r\nmonths. Wherefore leave me to carry the justice of God into effect and\r\nseek not to oppose that which thou mayst not avail to hinder.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 284: _i.e._ of her sin.]\r\n\r\nNastagio, hearing these words, drew back, grown all adread, with not\r\nan hair on his body but stood on end, and looking upon the wretched\r\ndamsel, began fearfully to await that which the knight should do. The\r\nlatter, having made an end of his discourse, ran, tuck in hand, as he\r\nwere a ravening dog, at the damsel, who, fallen on her knees and held\r\nfast by the two mastiffs, cried him mercy, and smiting her with all\r\nhis might amiddleward the breast, pierced her through and through. No\r\nsooner had she received this stroke than she fell grovelling on the\r\nground, still weeping and crying out; whereupon the knight, clapping\r\nhis hand to his hunting-knife, ripped open her loins and tearing forth\r\nher heart and all that was thereabout, cast them to the two mastiffs,\r\nwho devoured them incontinent, as being sore anhungred. Nor was it\r\nlong ere, as if none of these things had been, the damsel of a sudden\r\nrose to her feet and began to flee towards the sea, with the dogs\r\nafter her, still rending her; and in a little while they had gone so\r\nfar that Nastagio could see them no more. The latter, seeing these\r\nthings, abode a great while between pity and fear, and presently it\r\noccurred to his mind that this might much avail him, seeing that it\r\nbefell every Friday; wherefore, marking the place, he returned to his\r\nservants and after, whenas it seemed to him fit, he sent for sundry\r\nof his kinsmen and friends and said to them, 'You have long urged me\r\nleave loving this mine enemy and put an end to my expenditure, and I\r\nam ready to do it, provided you will obtain me a favour; the which is\r\nthis, that on the coming Friday you make shift to have Messer Paolo\r\nTraversari and his wife and daughter and all their kinswomen and what\r\nother ladies soever it shall please you here to dinner with me. That\r\nfor which I wish this, you shall see then.' This seemed to them a\r\nlittle thing enough to do, wherefore, returning to Ravenna, they in\r\ndue time invited those whom Nastagio would have to dine with him, and\r\nalbeit it was no easy matter to bring thither the young lady whom he\r\nloved, natheless she went with the other ladies. Meanwhile, Nastagio\r\nlet make ready a magnificent banquet and caused set the tables under\r\nthe pines round about the place where he had witnessed the slaughter\r\nof the cruel lady.\r\n\r\nThe time come, he seated the gentlemen and the ladies at table and so\r\nordered it that his mistress should be placed right over against the\r\nspot where the thing should befall. Accordingly, hardly was the last\r\ndish come when the despairful outcry of the hunted damsel began to be\r\nheard of all, whereat each of the company marvelled and enquired what\r\nwas to do, but none could say; whereupon all started to their feet and\r\nlooking what this might be, they saw the woeful damsel and the knight\r\nand the dogs; nor was it long ere they were all there among them.\r\nGreat was the clamor against both dogs and knight, and many rushed\r\nforward to succour the damsel; but the knight, bespeaking them as he\r\nhad bespoken Nastagio, not only made them draw back, but filled them\r\nall with terror and amazement. Then did he as he had done before,\r\nwhereat all the ladies that were there (and there were many present\r\nwho had been kinswomen both to the woeful damsel and to the knight and\r\nwho remembered them both of his love and of his death) wept as\r\npiteously as if they had seen this done to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe thing carried to its end and the damsel and the knight gone, the\r\nadventure set those who had seen it upon many and various discourses;\r\nbut of those who were the most affrighted was the cruel damsel beloved\r\nof Nastagio, who had distinctly seen and heard the whole matter and\r\nunderstood that these things concerned her more than any other who was\r\nthere, remembering her of the cruelty she had still used towards\r\nNastagio; wherefore herseemed she fled already before her enraged\r\nlover and had the mastiffs at her heels. Such was the terror awakened\r\nin her thereby that,--so this might not betide her,--no sooner did she\r\nfind an opportunity (which was afforded her that same evening) than,\r\nturning her hatred into love, she despatched to Nastagio a trusty\r\nchamberwoman of hers, who besought him that it should please him to go\r\nto her, for that she was ready to do all that should be his pleasure.\r\nHe answered that this was exceeding agreeable to him, but that, so it\r\npleased her, he desired to have his pleasure of her with honour, to\r\nwit, by taking her to wife. The damsel, who knew that it rested with\r\nnone other than herself that she had not been his wife, made answer to\r\nhim that it liked her well; then, playing the messenger herself, she\r\ntold her father and mother that she was content to be Nastagio's\r\nwife, whereat they were mightily rejoiced, and he, espousing her on\r\nthe ensuing Sunday and celebrating his nuptials, lived with her long\r\nand happily. Nor was this affright the cause of that good only; nay,\r\nall the ladies of Ravenna became so fearful by reason thereof, that\r\never after they were much more amenable than they had before been to\r\nthe desires of the men.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NINTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Fifth]\r\n\r\n     FEDERIGO DEGLI ALBERIGHI LOVETH AND IS NOT LOVED. HE WASTETH\r\n     HIS SUBSTANCE IN PRODIGAL HOSPITALITY TILL THERE IS LEFT HIM\r\n     BUT ONE SOLE FALCON, WHICH, HAVING NOUGHT ELSE, HE GIVETH\r\n     HIS MISTRESS TO EAT, ON HER COMING TO HIS HOUSE; AND SHE,\r\n     LEARNING THIS, CHANGETH HER MIND AND TAKING HIM TO HUSBAND,\r\n     MAKETH HIM RICH AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nFilomena having ceased speaking, the queen, seeing that none remained\r\nto tell save only herself and Dioneo, whose privilege entitled him to\r\nspeak last, said, with blithe aspect, \"It pertaineth now to me to tell\r\nand I, dearest ladies, will willingly do it, relating a story like in\r\npart to the foregoing, to the intent that not only may you know how\r\nmuch the love of you[285] can avail in gentle hearts, but that you may\r\nlearn to be yourselves, whenas it behoveth, bestowers of your\r\nguerdons, without always suffering fortune to be your guide, which\r\nmost times, as it chanceth, giveth not discreetly, but out of all\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 285: Syn. your charms (_la vostra vaghezza_).]\r\n\r\nYou must know, then, that Coppo di Borghese Domenichi, who was of our\r\ndays and maybe is yet a man of great worship and authority in our city\r\nand illustrious and worthy of eternal renown, much more for his\r\nfashions and his merit than for the nobility of his blood, being grown\r\nfull of years, delighted oftentimes to discourse with his neighbours\r\nand others of things past, the which he knew how to do better and more\r\norderly and with more memory and elegance of speech than any other\r\nman. Amongst other fine things of his, he was used to tell that there\r\nwas once in Florence a young man called Federigo, son of Messer\r\nFilippo Alberighi and renowned for deeds of arms and courtesy over\r\nevery other bachelor in Tuscany, who, as betideth most gentlemen,\r\nbecame enamoured of a gentlewoman named Madam Giovanna, in her day\r\nheld one of the fairest and sprightliest ladies that were in Florence;\r\nand to win her love, he held jousts and tourneyings and made\r\nentertainments and gave gifts and spent his substance without any\r\nstint; but she, being no less virtuous than fair, recked nought of\r\nthese things done for her nor of him who did them. Federigo spending\r\nthus far beyond his means and gaining nought, his wealth, as lightly\r\nhappeneth, in course of time came to an end and he abode poor, nor\r\nwas aught left him but a poor little farm, on whose returns he lived\r\nvery meagrely, and to boot a falcon he had, one of the best in the\r\nworld. Wherefore, being more in love than ever and himseeming he might\r\nno longer make such a figure in the city as he would fain do, he took\r\nup his abode at Campi, where his farm was, and there bore his poverty\r\nwith patience, hawking whenas he might and asking of no one.\r\n\r\nFederigo being thus come to extremity, it befell one day that Madam\r\nGiovanna's husband fell sick and seeing himself nigh upon death, made\r\nhis will, wherein, being very rich, he left a son of his, now well\r\ngrown, his heir, after which, having much loved Madam Giovanna, he\r\nsubstituted her to his heir, in case his son should die without lawful\r\nissue, and died. Madam Giovanna, being thus left a widow, betook\r\nherself that summer, as is the usance of our ladies, into the country\r\nwith her son to an estate of hers very near that of Federigo;\r\nwherefore it befell that the lad made acquaintance with the latter and\r\nbegan to take delight in hawks and hounds, and having many a time seen\r\nhis falcon flown and being strangely taken therewith, longed sore to\r\nhave it, but dared not ask it of him, seeing it so dear to him. The\r\nthing standing thus, it came to pass that the lad fell sick, whereat\r\nhis mother was sore concerned, as one who had none but him and loved\r\nhim with all her might, and abode about him all day, comforting him\r\nwithout cease; and many a time she asked him if there were aught he\r\ndesired, beseeching him tell it her, for an it might be gotten, she\r\nwould contrive that he should have it. The lad, having heard these\r\noffers many times repeated, said, 'Mother mine, an you could procure\r\nme to have Federigo's falcon, methinketh I should soon be whole.'\r\n\r\nThe lady hearing this, bethought herself awhile and began to consider\r\nhow she should do. She knew that Federigo had long loved her and had\r\nnever gotten of her so much as a glance of the eye; wherefore quoth\r\nshe in herself, 'How shall I send or go to him to seek of him this\r\nfalcon, which is, by all I hear, the best that ever flew and which, to\r\nboot, maintaineth him in the world? And how can I be so graceless as\r\nto offer to take this from a gentleman who hath none other pleasure\r\nleft?' Perplexed with this thought and knowing not what to say, for\r\nall she was very certain of getting the bird, if she asked for it, she\r\nmade no reply to her son, but abode silent. However, at last, the love\r\nof her son so got the better of her that she resolved in herself to\r\nsatisfy him, come what might, and not to send, but to go herself for\r\nthe falcon and fetch it to him. Accordingly she said to him, 'My son,\r\ntake comfort and bethink thyself to grow well again, for I promise\r\nthee that the first thing I do to-morrow morning I will go for it and\r\nfetch it to thee.' The boy was rejoiced at this and showed some\r\namendment that same day.\r\n\r\nNext morning, the lady, taking another lady to bear her company,\r\nrepaired, by way of diversion, to Federigo's little house and enquired\r\nfor the latter, who, for that it was no weather for hawking nor had\r\nbeen for some days past, was then in a garden he had, overlooking the\r\ndoing of certain little matters of his, and hearing that Madam\r\nGiovanna asked for him at the door, ran thither, rejoicing and\r\nmarvelling exceedingly. She, seeing him come, rose and going with\r\nwomanly graciousness to meet him, answered his respectful salutation\r\nwith 'Give you good day, Federigo!' then went on to say, 'I am come to\r\nmake thee amends for that which thou hast suffered through me, in\r\nloving me more than should have behooved thee; and the amends in\r\nquestion is this that I purpose to dine with thee this morning\r\nfamiliarly, I and this lady my companion.' 'Madam,' answered Federigo\r\nhumbly, 'I remember me not to have ever received any ill at your\r\nhands, but on the contrary so much good that, if ever I was worth\r\naught, it came about through your worth and the love I bore you; and\r\nassuredly, albeit you have come to a poor host, this your gracious\r\nvisit is far more precious to me than it would be an it were given me\r\nto spend over again as much as that which I have spent aforetime.' So\r\nsaying, he shamefastly received her into his house and thence brought\r\nher into his garden, where, having none else to bear her company, he\r\nsaid to her, 'Madam, since there is none else here, this good woman,\r\nwife of yonder husbandman, will bear you company, whilst I go see the\r\ntable laid.'\r\n\r\nNever till that moment, extreme as was his poverty, had he been so\r\ndolorously sensible of the straits to which he had brought himself for\r\nthe lack of those riches he had spent on such disorderly wise. But\r\nthat morning, finding he had nothing wherewithal he might honourably\r\nentertain the lady, for love of whom he had aforetime entertained folk\r\nwithout number, he was made perforce aware of his default and ran\r\nhither and thither, perplexed beyond measure, like a man beside\r\nhimself, inwardly cursing his ill fortune, but found neither money nor\r\naught he might pawn. It was now growing late and he having a great\r\ndesire to entertain the gentle lady with somewhat, yet choosing not to\r\nhave recourse to his own labourer, much less any one else, his eye\r\nfell on his good falcon, which he saw on his perch in his little\r\nsaloon; whereupon, having no other resource, he took the bird and\r\nfinding him fat, deemed him a dish worthy of such a lady. Accordingly,\r\nwithout more ado, he wrung the hawk's neck and hastily caused a little\r\nmaid of his pluck it and truss it and after put it on the spit and\r\nroast it diligently. Then, the table laid and covered with very white\r\ncloths, whereof he had yet some store, he returned with a blithe\r\ncountenance to the lady in the garden and told her that dinner was\r\nready, such as it was in his power to provide. Accordingly, the lady\r\nand her friend, arising, betook themselves to table and in company\r\nwith Federigo, who served them with the utmost diligence, ate the good\r\nfalcon, unknowing what they did.\r\n\r\nPresently, after they had risen from table and had abidden with him\r\nawhile in cheerful discourse, the lady, thinking it time to tell that\r\nwherefor she was come, turned to Federigo and courteously bespoke him,\r\nsaying, 'Federigo, I doubt not a jot but that, when thou hearest that\r\nwhich is the especial occasion of my coming hither, thou wilt marvel\r\nat my presumption, remembering thee of thy past life and of my virtue,\r\nwhich latter belike thou reputedst cruelty and hardness of heart;\r\nbut, if thou hadst or hadst had children, by whom thou mightest know\r\nhow potent is the love one beareth them, meseemeth certain that thou\r\nwouldst in part hold me excused. But, although thou hast none, I, who\r\nhave one child, cannot therefore escape the common laws to which other\r\nmothers are subject and whose enforcements it behoveth me ensue, need\r\nmust I, against my will and contrary to all right and seemliness, ask\r\nof thee a boon, which I know is supremely dear to thee (and that with\r\ngood reason, for that thy sorry fortune hath left thee none other\r\ndelight, none other diversion, none other solace), to wit, thy falcon,\r\nwhereof my boy is so sore enamoured that, an I carry it not to him, I\r\nfear me his present disorder will be so aggravated that there may\r\npresently ensue thereof somewhat whereby I shall lose him. Wherefore I\r\nconjure thee,--not by the love thou bearest me and whereto thou art\r\nnowise beholden, but by thine own nobility, which in doing courtesy\r\nhath approved itself greater than in any other,--that it please thee\r\ngive it to me, so by the gift I may say I have kept my son alive and\r\nthus made him for ever thy debtor.'\r\n\r\nFederigo, hearing what the lady asked and knowing that he could not\r\noblige her, for that he had given her the falcon to eat, fell\r\na-weeping in her presence, ere he could answer a word. The lady at\r\nfirst believed that his tears arose from grief at having to part from\r\nhis good falcon and was like to say that she would not have it.\r\nHowever, she contained herself and awaited what Federigo should reply,\r\nwho, after weeping awhile, made answer thus: 'Madam, since it pleased\r\nGod that I should set my love on you, I have in many things reputed\r\nfortune contrary to me and have complained of her; but all the ill\r\nturns she hath done me have been a light matter in comparison with\r\nthat which she doth me at this present and for which I can never more\r\nbe reconciled to her, considering that you are come hither to my poor\r\nhouse, whereas you deigned not to come what while I was rich, and seek\r\nof me a little boon, the which she hath so wrought that I cannot grant\r\nyou; and why this cannot be I will tell you briefly. When I heard that\r\nyou, of your favour, were minded to dine with me, I deemed it a light\r\nthing and a seemly, having regard to your worth and the nobility of\r\nyour station, to honour you, as far as in me lay, with some choicer\r\nvictual than that which is commonly set before other folk; wherefore,\r\nremembering me of the falcon which you ask of me and of his\r\nexcellence, I judged him a dish worthy of you. This very morning,\r\nthen, you have had him roasted upon the trencher, and indeed I had\r\naccounted him excellently well bestowed; but now, seeing that you\r\nwould fain have had him on other wise, it is so great a grief to me\r\nthat I cannot oblige you therein that methinketh I shall never forgive\r\nmyself therefor.' So saying, in witness of this, he let cast before\r\nher the falcon's feathers and feet and beak.\r\n\r\nThe lady, seeing and hearing this, first blamed him for having, to\r\ngive a woman to eat, slain such a falcon, and after inwardly much\r\ncommended the greatness of his soul, which poverty had not availed nor\r\nmight anywise avail to abate. Then, being put out of all hope of\r\nhaving the falcon and fallen therefore in doubt of her son's recovery,\r\nshe took her leave and returned, all disconsolate, to the latter,\r\nwho, before many days had passed, whether for chagrin that he could\r\nnot have the bird or for that his disorder was e'en fated to bring him\r\nto that pass, departed this life, to the inexpressible grief of his\r\nmother. After she had abidden awhile full of tears and affliction,\r\nbeing left very rich and yet young, she was more than once urged by\r\nher brothers to marry again, and albeit she would fain not have done\r\nso, yet, finding herself importuned and calling to mind Federigo's\r\nworth and his last magnificence, to wit, the having slain such a\r\nfalcon for her entertainment, she said to them, 'I would gladly, an it\r\nliked you, abide as I am; but, since it is your pleasure that I take a\r\n[second] husband, certes I will never take any other, an I have not\r\nFederigo degli Alberighi.' Whereupon her brothers, making mock of her,\r\nsaid 'Silly woman that thou art, what is this thou sayest? How canst\r\nthou choose him, seeing he hath nothing in the world?' 'Brothers\r\nmine,' answered she, 'I know very well that it is as you say; but I\r\nwould liefer have a man that lacketh of riches than riches that lack\r\nof a man.' Her brethren, hearing her mind and knowing Federigo for a\r\nman of great merit, poor though he was, gave her, with all her wealth,\r\nto him, even as she would; and he, seeing himself married to a lady of\r\nsuch worth and one whom he had loved so dear and exceeding rich, to\r\nboot, became a better husband of his substance and ended his days with\r\nher in joy and solace.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TENTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Fifth]\r\n\r\n     PIETRO DI VINCIOLO GOETH TO SUP ABROAD, WHEREUPON HIS WIFE\r\n     LETTETH FETCH HER A YOUTH TO KEEP HER COMPANY, AND HER\r\n     HUSBAND RETURNING, UNLOOKED FOR, SHE HIDETH HER GALLANT\r\n     UNDER A HEN-COOP. PIETRO TELLETH HER HOW THERE HAD BEEN\r\n     FOUND IN THE HOUSE OF ONE ARCOLANO, WITH WHOM HE WAS TO HAVE\r\n     SUPPED, A YOUNG MAN BROUGHT IN BY HIS WIFE, AND SHE BLAMETH\r\n     THE LATTER. PRESENTLY, AN ASS, BY MISCHANCE, SETTETH FOOT ON\r\n     THE FINGERS OF HIM WHO IS UNDER THE COOP AND HE ROARETH OUT,\r\n     WHEREUPON PIETRO RUNNETH THITHER AND ESPYING HIM,\r\n     DISCOVERETH HIS WIFE'S UNFAITH, BUT ULTIMATELY COMETH TO AN\r\n     ACCORD WITH HER FOR HIS OWN LEWD ENDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe queen's story come to an end and all having praised God for that\r\nHe had rewarded Federigo according to his desert, Dioneo, who never\r\nwaited for commandment, began on this wise: \"I know not whether to say\r\nif it be a casual vice, grown up in mankind through perversity of\r\nmanners and usances, or a defect inherent in our nature, that we laugh\r\nrather at things ill than at good works, especially when they concern\r\nus not. Wherefore, seeing that the pains I have otherwhiles taken and\r\nam now about to take aim at none other end than to rid you of\r\nmelancholy and afford you occasion for laughter and merriment,--albeit\r\nthe matter of my present story may be in part not altogether seemly,\r\nnevertheless, lovesome lasses, for that it may afford diversion, I\r\nwill e'en tell it you, and do you, hearkening thereunto, as you are\r\nwont to do, whenas you enter into gardens, where, putting out your\r\ndainty hands, you cull the roses and leave the thorns be. On this wise\r\nmust you do with my story, leaving the naughty man of whom I shall\r\ntell you to his infamy and ill-luck go with him, what while you laugh\r\nmerrily at the amorous devices of his wife, having compassion, whenas\r\nneed is, of the mischances of others.\r\n\r\nThere was, then, in Perugia, no great while agone, a rich man called\r\nPietro di Vinciolo, who, belike more to beguile others and to abate\r\nthe general suspect in which he was had of all the Perugians, than for\r\nany desire of his own, took him a wife, and fortune in this was so far\r\nconformable to his inclination that the wife he took was a thickset,\r\nred-haired, hot-complexioned wench, who would liefer have had two\r\nhusbands than one, whereas she happened upon one who had a mind far\r\nmore disposed to otherwhat than to her. Becoming, in process of time,\r\naware of this and seeing herself fair and fresh and feeling herself\r\nbuxom and lusty, she began by being sore incensed thereat and came\r\nonce and again to unseemly words thereof with her husband, with whom\r\nshe was well nigh always at variance. Then, seeing that this might\r\nresult rather in her own exhaustion than in the amendment of her\r\nhusband's depravity, she said in herself, 'Yonder caitiff forsaketh me\r\nto go of his ribaldries on pattens through the dry, and I will study\r\nto carry others on shipboard through the wet. I took him to husband\r\nand brought him a fine great dowry, knowing him to be a man and\r\nsupposing him desireful of that whereunto men are and should be fain;\r\nand had I not believed that he would play the part of a man, I had\r\nnever taken him. He knew that I was a woman; why, then, did he take me\r\nto wife, if women were not to his mind? This is not to be suffered.\r\nWere I minded to renounce the world, I should have made myself a nun;\r\nbut, if, choosing to live in the world, as I do, I look for delight or\r\npleasure from yonder fellow, I may belike grow old, expecting in vain,\r\nand whenas I shall be old, I shall in vain repent and bemoan myself of\r\nhaving wasted my youth, which latter he himself is a very good teacher\r\nand demonstrator how I should solace, showing me by example how I\r\nshould delect myself with that wherein he delighteth, more by token\r\nthat this were commendable in me, whereas in him it is exceeding\r\nblameworthy, seeing that I should offend against the laws alone,\r\nwhereas he offendeth against both law and nature.'\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the good lady, having thus bethought herself and belike\r\nmore than once, to give effect privily to these considerations,\r\nclapped up an acquaintance with an old woman who showed like Saint\r\nVerdiana, that giveth the serpents to eat, and still went to every\r\npardoning, beads in hand, nor ever talked of aught but the lives of\r\nthe Holy Fathers or of the wounds of St. Francis and was of well nigh\r\nall reputed a saint, and whenas it seemed to her time, frankly\r\ndiscovered to her her intent. 'Daughter mine,' replied the beldam,\r\n'God who knoweth all knoweth that thou wilt do exceeding well, and if\r\nfor nought else, yet shouldst thou do it, thou and every other young\r\nwoman, not to lose the time of your youth, for that to whoso hath\r\nunderstanding, there is no grief like that of having lost one's time.\r\nAnd what a devil are we women good for, once we are old, save to keep\r\nthe ashes about the fire-pot? If none else knoweth it and can bear\r\nwitness thereof, that do and can I; for, now that I am old, I\r\nrecognize without avail, but not without very sore and bitter remorse\r\nof mind, the time that I let slip, and albeit I lost it not altogether\r\n(for that I would not have thee deem me a ninny), still I did not what\r\nI might have done; whereof whenas I remember me, seeing myself\r\nfashioned as thou seest me at this present, so that thou wouldst find\r\nnone to give me fire to my tinder,[286] God knoweth what chagrin I\r\nfeel. With men it is not so; they are born apt for a thousand things,\r\nnot for this alone, and most part of them are of much more account old\r\nthan young; but women are born into the world for nothing but to do\r\nthis and bear children, and it is for this that they are prized; the\r\nwhich, if from nought else, thou mayst apprehend from this, that we\r\nwomen are still ready for the sport; more by token that one woman\r\nwould tire out many men at the game, whereas many men cannot tire one\r\nwoman; and for that we are born unto this, I tell thee again that thou\r\nwilt do exceeding well to return thy husband a loaf for his bannock,\r\nso thy soul may have no cause to reproach thy flesh in thine old age.\r\nEach one hath of this world just so much as he taketh to himself\r\nthereof, and especially is this the case with women, whom it behoveth,\r\nmuch more than men, make use of their time, whilst they have it; for\r\nthou mayst see how, when we grow old, nor husband nor other will look\r\nat us; nay, they send us off to the kitchen to tell tales to the cat\r\nand count the pots and pans; and what is worse, they tag rhymes on us\r\nand say,\r\n\r\n     \"Tidbits for wenches young;\r\n     Gags[287] for the old wife's tongue.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 286: _i.e._ she was grown so repulsively ugly in her old\r\nage, that no one cared to do her even so trifling a service as giving\r\nher a spark in tinder to light her fire withal.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 287: Or chokebits (_stranguglioni_).]\r\n\r\nAnd many another thing to the like purpose. And that I may hold thee\r\nno longer in parley, I tell thee in fine that thou couldst not have\r\ndiscovered thy mind to any one in the world who can be more useful to\r\nthee than I, for that there is no man so high and mighty but I dare\r\ntell him what behoveth, nor any so dour or churlish but I know how to\r\nsupple him aright and bring him to what I will. Wherefore do thou but\r\nshow me who pleaseth thee and after leave me do; but one thing I\r\ncommend to thee, daughter mine, and that is, that thou be mindful of\r\nme, for that I am a poor body and would have thee henceforth a sharer\r\nin all my pardonings and in all the paternosters I shall say, so God\r\nmay make them light and candles for thy dead.'[288]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 288: _i.e._ that they may serve to purchase remission from\r\npurgatory for the souls of her dead relatives, instead of the burning\r\nof candles and tapers, which is held by the Roman Catholic Church to\r\nhave that effect.]\r\n\r\nWith this she made an end of her discourse, and the young lady came to\r\nan understanding with her that, whenas she chanced to spy a certain\r\nyoung spark who passed often through that quarter and whose every\r\nfeature she set out to her, she should know what she had to do; then,\r\ngiving her a piece of salt meat, she dismissed her with God's\r\nblessing; nor had many days passed ere the old woman brought her him\r\nof whom she had bespoken her privily into her chamber, and a little\r\nwhile after, another and another, according as they chanced to take\r\nthe lady's fancy, who stinted not to indulge herself in this as often\r\nas occasion offered, though still fearful of her husband. It chanced\r\none evening that, her husband being to sup abroad with a friend of\r\nhis, Ercolano by name, she charged the old woman bring her a youth,\r\nwho was one of the goodliest and most agreeable of all Perugia, which\r\nshe promptly did; but hardly had the lady seated herself at table to\r\nsup with her gallant, when, behold, Pietro called out at the door to\r\nhave it opened to him. She, hearing this, gave herself up for lost,\r\nbut yet desiring, an she might, to conceal the youth and not having\r\nthe presence of mind to send him away or hide him elsewhere, made him\r\ntake refuge under a hen-coop, that was in a shed adjoining the chamber\r\nwhere they were at supper, and cast over him the sacking of a\r\npallet-bed that she had that day let empty.\r\n\r\nThis done, she made haste to open to her husband, to whom quoth she,\r\nas soon as he entered the house, 'You have very soon despatched this\r\nsupper of yours!' 'We have not so much as tasted it,' replied he; and\r\nshe said, 'How was that?' Quoth he, 'I will tell thee. Scarce were we\r\nseated at table, Ercolano and his wife and I, when we heard some one\r\nsneeze hard by, whereof we took no note the first time nor the second;\r\nbut, he who sneezed sneezing yet a third time and a fourth and a fifth\r\nand many other times, it made us all marvel; whereupon Ercolano, who\r\nwas somewhat vexed with his wife for that she had kept us a great\r\nwhile standing at the door, without opening to us, said, as if in a\r\nrage, \"What meaneth this? Who is it sneezeth thus?\" And rising from\r\ntable, made for a stair that stood near at hand and under which, hard\r\nby the stairfoot, was a closure of planks, wherein to bestow all\r\nmanner things, as we see those do every day who set their houses in\r\norder. Himseeming it was from this that came the noise of sneezing, he\r\nopened a little door that was therein and no sooner had he done this\r\nthan there issued forth thereof the frightfullest stench of sulphur\r\nthat might be. Somewhat of this smell had already reached us and we\r\ncomplaining thereof, the lady had said, \"It is because I was but now\r\nin act to bleach my veils with sulphur and after set the pan, over\r\nwhich I had spread them to catch the fumes, under the stair, so that\r\nit yet smoketh thereof.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the smoke was somewhat spent, Ercolano looked into the\r\ncupboard and there espied him who had sneezed and who was yet in act\r\nto sneeze, for that the fumes of the sulphur constrained him thereto,\r\nand indeed they had by this time so straitened his breast that, had he\r\nabidden a while longer, he had never sneezed nor done aught else\r\nagain. Ercolano, seeing him, cried out, \"Now, wife, I see why, whenas\r\nwe came hither awhile ago, we were kept so long at the door, without\r\nits being opened to us; but may I never again have aught that shall\r\nplease me, an I pay thee not for this!\" The lady, hearing this and\r\nseeing that her sin was discovered, stayed not to make any excuse, but\r\nstarted up from table and made off I know not whither. Ercolano,\r\nwithout remarking his wife's flight, again and again bade him who\r\nsneezed come forth; but the latter, who was now at the last gasp,\r\noffered not to stir, for all that he could say; whereupon, taking him\r\nby one foot, he haled him forth of his hiding-place and ran for a\r\nknife to kill him; but I, fearing the police on mine own account,\r\narose and suffered him not to slay him or do him any hurt; nay, crying\r\nout and defending him, I gave the alarm to certain of the neighbours,\r\nwho ran thither and taking the now half-dead youth, carried him forth\r\nthe house I know not whither. Wherefore, our supper being disturbed by\r\nthese things, I have not only not despatched it, nay, I have, as I\r\nsaid, not even tasted it.'\r\n\r\nThe lady, hearing this, knew that there were other women as wise as\r\nherself, albeit illhap bytimes betided some of them thereof, and would\r\nfain have defended Ercolano's wife with words; but herseeming that, by\r\nblaming others' defaults, she might make freer way for her own, she\r\nbegan to say, 'Here be fine doings! A holy and virtuous lady indeed\r\nshe must be! She, to whom, as I am an honest woman, I would have\r\nconfessed myself, so spiritually minded meseemed she was! And the\r\nworst of it is that she, being presently an old woman, setteth a\r\nmighty fine example to the young. Accursed by the hour she came into\r\nthe world and she also, who suffereth herself to live, perfidious and\r\nvile woman that she must be, the general reproach and shame of all the\r\nladies of this city, who, casting to the winds her honour and the\r\nfaith plighted to her husband and the world's esteem, is not ashamed\r\nto dishonour him, and herself with him, for another man, him who is\r\nsuch a man and so worshipful a citizen and who used her so well! So\r\nGod save me, there should be no mercy had of such women as she; they\r\nshould be put to death; they should be cast alive into the fire and\r\nburned to ashes.' Then, bethinking her of her gallant, whom she had\r\nhard by under the coop, she began to exhort Pietro to betake himself\r\nto bed, for that it was time; but he, having more mind to eat than to\r\nsleep, enquired if there was aught for supper. 'Supper, quotha!'\r\nanswered the lady. 'Truly, we are much used to get supper, whenas thou\r\nart abroad! A fine thing, indeed! Dost thou take me for Ercolano's\r\nwife? Alack, why dost thou not go to sleep for to-night? How far\r\nbetter thou wilt do!' Now it chanced that, certain husbandmen of\r\nPietro's being come that evening with sundry matters from the farm and\r\nhaving put up their asses, without watering them, in a little stable\r\nadjoining the shed, one of the latter, being sore athirst, slipped his\r\nhead out of the halter and making his way out of the stable, went\r\nsmelling to everything, so haply he might find some water, and going\r\nthus, he came presently full on the hen-coop, under which was the\r\nyoung man. The latter having, for that it behoved him abide on all\r\nfours, put out the fingers of one hand on the ground beyond the coop,\r\nsuch was his luck, or rather let us say, his ill luck, that the ass\r\nset his hoof on them, whereupon the youth, feeling an exceeding great\r\npain, set up a terrible outcry. Pietro, hearing this, marvelled and\r\nperceived that the noise came from within the house; wherefore he went\r\nout into the shed and hearing the other still clamouring, for that the\r\nass had not lifted up his hoof from his fingers, but still trod hard\r\nupon them, said, 'Who is there?' Then, running to the hen-coop, he\r\nraised it and espied the young man, who, beside the pain he suffered\r\nfrom his fingers that were crushed by the ass's hoof, was all\r\na-trembling for fear lest Pietro should do him a mischief.\r\n\r\nThe latter, knowing him for one whom he had long pursued for his lewd\r\nends, asked him what he did there, whereto he answered him nothing,\r\nbut prayed him for the love of God do him no harm. Quoth Pietro,\r\n'Arise and fear not that I will do thee any hurt; but tell me how thou\r\ncomest here and for what purpose.' The youth told him all, whereupon\r\nPietro, no less rejoiced to have found him than his wife was woeful,\r\ntaking him by the hand, carried him into the chamber, where the lady\r\nawaited him with the greatest affright in the world, and seating\r\nhimself overagainst her, said, 'But now thou cursedst Ercolano's wife\r\nand avouchedst that she should be burnt and that she was the disgrace\r\nof all you women; why didst thou not speak of thyself? Or, an thou\r\nchoosedst not to speak of thyself, how could thy conscience suffer\r\nthee to speak thus of her, knowing thyself to have done even as did\r\nshe? Certes, none other thing moved thee thereunto save that you women\r\nare all made thus and look to cover your own doings with others'\r\ndefaults; would fire might come from heaven to burn you all up,\r\nperverse generation that you are!'\r\n\r\nThe lady, seeing that, in the first heat of the discovery, he had done\r\nher no harm other than in words and herseeming she saw that he was all\r\nagog with joy for that he held so goodly a stripling by the hand, took\r\nheart and said, 'Of this much, indeed, I am mighty well assured, that\r\nthou wouldst have fire come from heaven to burn us women all up,\r\nbeing, as thou art, as fain to us as a dog to cudgels; but, by Christ\r\nHis cross, thou shalt not get thy wish. However, I would fain have a\r\nlittle discourse with thee, so I may know of what thou complainest.\r\nCertes, it were a fine thing an thou shouldst seek to even me with\r\nErcolano's wife, who is a beat-breast, a smell-sin,[289] and hath of\r\nher husband what she will and is of him held dear as a wife should be,\r\nthe which is not the case with me. For, grant that I am well clad and\r\nshod of thee, thou knowest but too well how I fare for the rest and\r\nhow long it is since thou hast lain with me; and I had liefer go\r\nbarefoot and rags to my back and be well used of thee abed than have\r\nall these things, being used as I am of thee. For understand plainly,\r\nPietro; I am a woman like other women and have a mind unto that which\r\nother women desire; so that, an I procure me thereof, not having it\r\nfrom thee, thou hast no call to missay of me therefor; at the least, I\r\ndo thee this much honour that I have not to do with horseboys and\r\nscald-heads.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 289: _i.e._ a hypocritical sham devotee, covering a lewd\r\nlife with an appearance of sanctity.]\r\n\r\nPietro perceived that words were not like to fail her for all that\r\nnight; wherefore, as one who recked little of her, 'Wife,' said he,\r\n'no more for the present; I will content thee aright of this matter;\r\nbut thou wilt do us a great courtesy to let us have somewhat to sup\r\nwithal, for that meseemeth this lad, like myself, hath not yet\r\nsupped.' 'Certes, no,' answered the lady, 'he hath not yet supped; for\r\nwe were sitting down to table, when thou camest in thine ill hour.'\r\n'Go, then,' rejoined Pietro, 'contrive that we may sup, and after I\r\nwill order this matter on such wise that thou shalt have no cause to\r\ncomplain.' The lady, finding that her husband was satisfied, arose and\r\ncaused straightway reset the table; then, letting bring the supper she\r\nhad prepared, she supped merrily in company with her caitiff of a\r\nhusband and the young man. After supper, what Pietro devised for the\r\nsatisfaction of all three hath escaped my mind; but this much I know\r\nthat on the following morning the youth was escorted back to the\r\npublic place, not altogether certain which he had the more been that\r\nnight, wife or husband. Wherefore, dear my ladies, this will I say to\r\nyou, 'Whoso doth it to you, do you it to him'; and if you cannot\r\npresently, keep it in mind till such time as you can, so he may get as\r\ngood as he giveth.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDioneo having made an end of his story, which had been less laughed at\r\nby the ladies [than usual], more for shamefastness than for the little\r\ndelight they took therein, the queen, seeing the end of her sovranty\r\ncome, rose to her feet and putting off the laurel crown, set it\r\nblithely on Elisa's head, saying, \"With you, madam, henceforth it\r\nresteth to command.\" Elisa, accepting the honour, did even as it had\r\nbeen done before her, in that, having first, to the satisfaction of\r\nthe company, taken order with the seneschal for that whereof there was\r\nneed for the time of her governance, she said, \"We have many a time\r\nheard how, by dint of smart sayings and ready repartees and prompt\r\nadvisements, many have availed with an apt retort[290] to take the\r\nedge off other folks' teeth or to fend off imminent perils; and, for\r\nthat the matter is goodly and may be useful,[291] I will that\r\nto-morrow, with God's aid, it be discoursed within these terms, to\r\nwit, OF WHOSO, BEING ASSAILED WITH SOME JIBING SPEECH, HATH VINDICATED\r\nHIMSELF OR HATH WITH SOME READY REPLY OR ADVISEMENT ESCAPED LOSS,\r\nPERIL OR SHAME.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 290: Lit. a due or deserved bite (_debito morso_). I mention\r\nthis to show the connection with teeth.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 291: An ellipsis of a kind common in Boccaccio and indeed in\r\nall the old Italian writers, meaning \"it may be useful to enlarge upon\r\nthe subject in question.\"]\r\n\r\nThis was much commended of all, whereupon the queen, rising to her\r\nfeet, dismissed them all until supper time. The honourable company,\r\nseeing her risen, stood up all and each, according to the wonted\r\nfashion, applied himself to that which was most agreeable to him. But,\r\nthe crickets having now given over singing, the queen let call every\r\none and they betook themselves to supper, which being despatched with\r\nmerry cheer, they all gave themselves to singing and making music, and\r\nEmilia having, at the queen's commandment, set up a dance, Dioneo was\r\nbidden sing a song, whereupon he straightway struck up with \"Mistress\r\nAldruda, come lift up your fud-a, for I bring you, I bring you, good\r\ntidings.\" Whereat all the ladies fell a-laughing and especially the\r\nqueen, who bade him leave that and sing another. Quoth Dioneo, \"Madam,\r\nhad I a tabret, I would sing 'Come truss your coats, I prithee,\r\nMistress Burdock,' or 'Under the olive the grass is'; or will you have\r\nme say 'The waves of the sea do great evil to me'? But I have no\r\ntabret, so look which you will of these others. Will it please you\r\nhave 'Come forth unto us, so it may be cut down, like a May in the\r\nmidst of the meadows'?\" \"Nay,\" answered the queen; \"give us another.\"\r\n\"Then,\" said Dioneo, \"shall I sing, 'Mistress Simona, embarrel,\r\nembarrel! It is not the month of October'?\" Quoth the queen, laughing,\r\n\"Ill luck to thee, sing us a goodly one, an thou wilt, for we will\r\nnone of these.\" \"Nay, madam,\" rejoined Dioneo, \"fash not yourself; but\r\nwhich then like you better? I know more than a thousand. Will you have\r\n'This my shell an I prick it not well,' or 'Fair and softly, husband\r\nmine' or 'I'll buy me a cock, a cock of an hundred pounds\r\nsterling'?\"[292] Therewithal the queen, somewhat provoked, though all\r\nthe other ladies laughed, said, \"Dioneo, leave jesting and sing us a\r\ngoodly one; else shalt thou prove how I can be angry.\" Hearing this,\r\nhe gave over his quips and cranks and forthright fell a-singing after\r\nthis fashion:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 292: The songs proposed by Dioneo are all apparently of a\r\nlight, if not a wanton, character and \"not fit to be sung before\r\nladies.\"]\r\n\r\n         O Love, the amorous light\r\n     That beameth from yon fair one's lovely eyes\r\n     Hath made me thine and hers in servant-guise.\r\n\r\n     The splendour of her lovely eyes, it wrought\r\n       That first thy flames were kindled in my breast,\r\n         Passing thereto through mine;\r\n     Yea, and thy virtue first unto my thought\r\n       Her visage fair it was made manifest,\r\n         Which picturing, I twine\r\n         And lay before her shrine\r\n     All virtues, that to her I sacrifice,\r\n     Become the new occasion of my sighs.\r\n\r\n     Thus, dear my lord, thy vassal am I grown\r\n       And of thy might obediently await\r\n         Grace for my lowliness;\r\n     Yet wot I not if wholly there be known\r\n       The high desire that in my breast thou'st set\r\n         And my sheer faith, no less,\r\n         Of her who doth possess\r\n     My heart so that from none beneath the skies,\r\n     Save her alone, peace would I take or prize.\r\n\r\n     Wherefore I pray thee, sweet my lord and sire,\r\n       Discover it to her and cause her taste\r\n         Some scantling of thy heat\r\n     To-me-ward,--for thou seest that in the fire,\r\n       Loving, I languish and for torment waste\r\n         By inches at her feet,--\r\n         And eke in season meet\r\n     Commend me to her favour on such wise\r\n     As I would plead for thee, should need arise.[293]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 293: This singularly naïve give-and-take fashion of asking a\r\nfavour of a God recalls the old Scotch epitaph cited by Mr. George\r\nMacdonald:\r\n\r\n     Here lie I Martin Elginbrodde:\r\n     Hae mercy o' my soul, Lord God;\r\n     As I wad do, were I Lord God\r\n     And ye were Martin Elginbrodde.]\r\n\r\nDioneo, by his silence, showing that his song was ended, the queen let\r\nsing many others, having natheless much commended his. Then, somedele\r\nof the night being spent and the queen feeling the heat of the day to\r\nbe now overcome of the coolness of the night, she bade each at his\r\npleasure betake himself to rest against the ensuing day.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE ENDETH THE FIFTH DAY\r\nOF THE DECAMERON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Day the Sixth_\r\n\r\n     HERE BEGINNETH THE SIXTH DAY OF THE DECAMERON WHEREIN UNDER\r\n     THE GOVERNANCE OF ELISA IS DISCOURSED OF WHOSO BEING\r\n     ASSAILED WITH SOME JIBING SPEECH HATH VINDICATED HIMSELF OR\r\n     HATH WITH SOME READY REPLY OR ADVISEMENT ESCAPED LOSS, PERIL\r\n     OR SHAME\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moon, being now in the middest heaven, had lost its radiance and\r\nevery part of our world was bright with the new coming light, when,\r\nthe queen arising and letting call her company, they all with slow\r\nstep fared forth and rambled over the dewy grass to a little distance\r\nfrom the fair hill, holding various discourse of one thing and another\r\nand debating of the more or less goodliness of the stories told, what\r\nwhile they renewed their laughter at the various adventures related\r\ntherein, till such time as the sun mounting high and beginning to wax\r\nhot, it seemed well to them all to turn homeward. Wherefore, reversing\r\ntheir steps, they returned to the palace and there, by the queen's\r\ncommandment, the tables being already laid and everything strewn with\r\nsweet-scented herbs and fair flowers, they addressed themselves to\r\neat, ere the heat should grow greater. This being joyously\r\naccomplished, ere they did otherwhat, they sang divers goodly and\r\npleasant canzonets, after which some went to sleep, whilst some sat\r\ndown to play at chess and other some at tables and Dioneo fell to\r\nsinging, in concert with Lauretta, of Troilus and Cressida. Then, the\r\nhour come for their reassembling after the wonted fashion,[294] they\r\nall, being summoned on the part of the queen, seated themselves, as\r\nof their usance, about the fountain; but, as she was about to call for\r\nthe first story, there befell a thing that had not yet befallen there,\r\nto wit, that a great clamour was heard by her and by all, made by the\r\nwenches and serving-men in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 294: Lit. for their returning to consistory (_del dovere a\r\nconcistoro tornare_).]\r\n\r\nThe seneschal, being called and questioned who it was that cried thus\r\nand what might be the occasion of the turmoil, answered that the\r\nclamour was between Licisca and Tindaro, but that he knew not the\r\ncause thereof, being but then come thither to make them bide quiet,\r\nwhenas he had been summoned on her part. The queen bade him\r\nincontinent fetch thither the two offenders and they being come,\r\nenquired what was the cause of their clamour; whereto Tindaro offering\r\nto reply, Licisca, who was well in years and somewhat overmasterful,\r\nbeing heated with the outcry she had made, turned to him with an angry\r\nair and said, \"Mark this brute of a man who dareth to speak before me,\r\nwhereas I am! Let me speak.\" Then, turning again to the queen,\r\n\"Madam,\" quoth she, \"this fellow would teach me, forsooth, to know\r\nSicofante's wife and neither more nor less than as if I had not been\r\nfamiliar with her, would fain give me to believe that, the first night\r\nher husband lay with her, Squire Maul[295] made his entry into Black\r\nHill[296] by force and with effusion of blood; and I say that it is\r\nnot true; nay, he entered there in peace and to the great contentment\r\nof those within. Marry, this fellow is simple enough to believe\r\nwenches to be such ninnies that they stand to lose their time, abiding\r\nthe commodity of their fathers and brothers, who six times out of\r\nseven tarry three or four years more than they should to marry them.\r\nWell would they fare, forsooth, were they to wait so long! By Christ\r\nHis faith (and I should know what I say, when I swear thus) I have not\r\na single gossip who went a maid to her husband; and as for the wives,\r\nI know full well how many and what tricks they play their husbands;\r\nand this blockhead would teach me to know women, as if I had been born\r\nyesterday.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 295: _Messer Mazza_, _i.e._ veretrum.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 296: _Monte Nero_, _i.e._ vas muliebre.]\r\n\r\nWhat while Licisca spoke, the ladies kept up such a laughing that you\r\nmight have drawn all their teeth; and the queen imposed silence upon\r\nher a good half dozen times, but to no purpose; she stinted not till\r\nshe had said her say. When she had at last made an end of her talk,\r\nthe queen turned to Dioneo and said, laughing, \"Dioneo, this is a\r\nmatter for thy jurisdiction; wherefore, when we shall have made an end\r\nof our stories, thou shalt proceed to give final judgment thereon.\"\r\nWhereto he answered promptly, \"Madam, the judgment is already given,\r\nwithout hearing more of the matter; and I say that Licisca is in the\r\nright and opine that it is even as she saith and that Tindaro is an\r\nass.\" Licisca, hearing this, fell a-laughing and turning to Tindaro,\r\nsaid, \"I told thee so; begone and God go with thee; thinkest thou thou\r\nknowest better than I, thou whose eyes are not yet dry?[297] Gramercy,\r\nI have not lived here below for nothing, no, not I!\" And had not the\r\nqueen with an angry air imposed silence on her and sent her and\r\nTindaro away, bidding her make no more words or clamour, an she would\r\nnot be flogged, they had had nought to do all that day but attend to\r\nher. When they were gone, the queen called on Filomena to make a\r\nbeginning with the day's stories and she blithely began thus:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 297: _i.e._ who are yet a child, in modern parlance, \"Thou\r\nwhose lips are yet wet with thy mother's milk.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Sixth]\r\n\r\n     A GENTLEMAN ENGAGETH TO MADAM ORETTA TO CARRY HER\r\n     A-HORSEBACK WITH A STORY, BUT, TELLING IT DISORDERLY, IS\r\n     PRAYED BY HER TO SET HER DOWN AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Young ladies, like as stars, in the clear nights, are the ornaments\r\nof the heavens and the flowers and the leaf-clad shrubs, in the\r\nSpring, of the green fields and the hillsides, even so are\r\npraiseworthy manners and goodly discourse adorned by sprightly\r\nsallies, the which, for that they are brief, beseem women yet better\r\nthan men, inasmuch as much speaking is more forbidden to the former\r\nthan to the latter. Yet, true it is, whatever the cause, whether it be\r\nthe meanness of our[298] understanding or some particular grudge borne\r\nby heaven to our times, that there be nowadays few or no women left\r\nwho know how to say a witty word in due season or who, an it be said\r\nto them, know how to apprehend it as it behoveth; the which is a\r\ngeneral reproach to our whole sex. However, for that enough hath been\r\nsaid aforetime on the subject by Pampinea,[299] I purpose to say no\r\nmore thereof; but, to give you to understand how much goodliness there\r\nis in witty sayings, when spoken in due season, it pleaseth me to\r\nrecount to you the courteous fashion in which a lady imposed silence\r\nupon a gentleman.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 298: _i.e._ women's.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 299: See ante, p. 43, Introduction to the last story of the\r\nFirst Day.]\r\n\r\nAs many of you ladies may either know by sight or have heard tell,\r\nthere was not long since in our city a noble and well-bred and\r\nwell-spoken gentlewoman, whose worth merited not that her name be left\r\nunsaid. She was called, then, Madam Oretta and was the wife of Messer\r\nGeri Spina. She chanced to be, as we are, in the country, going from\r\nplace to place, by way of diversion, with a company of ladies and\r\ngentlemen, whom she had that day entertained to dinner at her house,\r\nand the way being belike somewhat long from the place whence they set\r\nout to that whither they were all purposed to go afoot, one of the\r\ngentlemen said to her, 'Madam Oretta, an you will, I will carry you\r\na-horseback great part of the way we have to go with one of the finest\r\nstories in the world.' 'Nay, sir,' answered the lady, 'I pray you\r\ninstantly thereof; indeed, it will be most agreeable to me.' Master\r\ncavalier, who maybe fared no better, sword at side than tale on\r\ntongue, hearing this, began a story of his, which of itself was in\r\ntruth very goodly; but he, now thrice or four or even half a dozen\r\ntimes repeating one same word, anon turning back and whiles saying, 'I\r\nsaid not aright,' and often erring in the names and putting one for\r\nanother, marred it cruelly, more by token that he delivered himself\r\nexceedingly ill, having regard to the quality of the persons and the\r\nnature of the incidents of his tale. By reason whereof, Madam Oretta,\r\nhearkening to him, was many a time taken with a sweat and failing of\r\nthe heart, as she were sick and near her end, and at last, being\r\nunable to brook the thing any more and seeing the gentleman engaged in\r\nan imbroglio from which he was not like to extricate himself, she said\r\nto him pleasantly, 'Sir, this horse of yours hath too hard a trot;\r\nwherefore I pray you be pleased to set me down.' The gentleman, who,\r\nas it chanced, understood a hint better than he told a story, took the\r\njest in good part and turning it off with a laugh, fell to discoursing\r\nof other matters and left unfinished the story that he had begun and\r\nconducted so ill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Sixth]\r\n\r\n     CISTI THE BAKER WITH A WORD OF HIS FASHION MAKETH MESSER\r\n     GERI SPINA SENSIBLE OF AN INDISCREET REQUEST OF HIS\r\n\r\n\r\nMadam Oretta's saying was greatly commended of all, ladies and men,\r\nand the queen bidding Pampinea follow on, she began thus: \"Fair\r\nladies, I know not of mine own motion to resolve me which is the more\r\nat fault, whether nature in fitting to a noble soul a mean body or\r\nfortune in imposing a mean condition upon a body endowed with a noble\r\nsoul, as in one our townsman Cisti and in many another we may have\r\nseen it happen; which Cisti being gifted with a very lofty spirit,\r\nfortune made him a baker. And for this, certes, I should curse both\r\nnature and fortune like, did I not know the one to be most discreet\r\nand the other to have a thousand eyes, albeit fools picture her blind;\r\nand I imagine, therefore, that, being exceeding well-advised, they do\r\nthat which is oftentimes done of human beings, who, uncertain of\r\nfuture events, bury their most precious things, against their\r\noccasions, in the meanest places of their houses, as being the least\r\nsuspect, and thence bring them forth in their greatest needs, the mean\r\nplace having the while kept them more surely than would the goodly\r\nchamber. And so, meseemeth, do the governors of the world hide\r\noftentimes their most precious things under the shadow of crafts and\r\nconditions reputed most mean, to the end that, bringing them forth\r\ntherefrom in time of need, their lustre may show the brighter. Which\r\nhow Cisti the baker made manifest, though in but a trifling matter,\r\nrestoring to Messer Geri Spina (whom the story but now told of Madam\r\nOretta, who was his wife, hath recalled to my memory) the eyes of the\r\nunderstanding, it pleaseth me to show you in a very short story.\r\n\r\nI must tell you, then, that Pope Boniface, with whom Messer Geri\r\nSpina was in very great favour, having despatched to Florence certain\r\nof his gentlemen on an embassy concerning sundry important matters of\r\nhis, they lighted down at the house of Messer Geri and he treating the\r\npope's affairs in company with them, it chanced, whatever might have\r\nbeen the occasion thereof, that he and they passed well nigh every\r\nmorning afoot before Santa Maria Ughi, where Cisti the baker had his\r\nbakehouse and plied his craft in person. Now, albeit fortune had\r\nappointed Cisti a humble enough condition, she had so far at the least\r\nbeen kind to him therein that he was grown very rich and without ever\r\nchoosing to abandon it for any other, lived very splendidly, having,\r\namongst his other good things, the best wines, white and red, that\r\nwere to be found in Florence or in the neighbouring country. Seeing\r\nMesser Geri and the pope's ambassadors pass every morning before his\r\ndoor and the heat being great, he bethought himself that it were a\r\ngreat courtesy to give them to drink of his good white wine; but,\r\nhaving regard to his own condition and that of Messer Geri, he deemed\r\nit not a seemly thing to presume to invite them, but determined to\r\nbear himself on such wise as should lead Messer Geri to invite\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, having still on his body a very white doublet and an\r\napron fresh from the wash, which bespoke him rather a miller than a\r\nbaker, he let set before his door, every morning, towards the time\r\nwhen he looked for Messer Geri and the ambassadors to pass, a new\r\ntinned pail of fair water and a small pitcher of new Bolognese ware,\r\nfull of his good white wine, together with two beakers, which seemed\r\nof silver, so bright they were, and seated himself there, against they\r\nshould pass, when, after clearing his throat once or twice, he fell to\r\ndrinking of that his wine with such a relish that he had made a dead\r\nman's mouth water for it. Messer Geri, having seen him do thus one and\r\ntwo mornings, said on the third, 'How now, Cisti? Is it good?'\r\nWhereupon he started to his feet and said, 'Ay is it, Sir; but how\r\ngood I cannot give you to understand, except you taste thereof.'\r\nMesser Geri, in whom either the nature of the weather or belike the\r\nrelish with which he saw Cisti drink had begotten a thirst, turned to\r\nthe ambassadors and said, smiling, 'Gentlemen, we shall do well to\r\ntaste this honest man's wine; belike it is such that we shall not\r\nrepent thereof.' Accordingly, he made with them towards Cisti, who let\r\nbring a goodly settle out of his bakehouse and praying them sit, said\r\nto their serving-men, who pressed forward to rinse the beakers, 'Stand\r\nback, friends, and leave this office to me, for that I know no less\r\nwell how to skink than to wield the baking-peel; and look you not to\r\ntaste a drop thereof.' So saying, he with his own hands washed out\r\nfour new and goodly beakers and letting bring a little pitcher of his\r\ngood wine, busied himself with giving Messer Geri and his companions\r\nto drink, to whom the wine seemed the best they had drunken that great\r\nwhile; wherefore they commended it greatly, and well nigh every\r\nmorning, whilst the ambassadors abode there, Messer Geri went thither\r\nto drink in company with them.\r\n\r\nAfter awhile, their business being despatched and they about to\r\ndepart, Messer Geri made them a magnificent banquet, whereto he bade\r\na number of the most worshipful citizens and amongst the rest, Cisti,\r\nwho would, however, on no condition go thither; whereupon Messer Geri\r\nbade one of his serving-men go fetch a flask of the baker's wine and\r\ngive each guest a half beaker thereof with the first course. The\r\nservant, despiteful most like for that he had never availed to drink\r\nof the wine, took a great flagon, which when Cisti saw, 'My son,' said\r\nhe, 'Messer Geri sent thee not to me.' The man avouched again and\r\nagain that he had, but, getting none other answer, returned to Messer\r\nGeri and reported it to him. Quoth he, 'Go back to him and tell him\r\nthat I do indeed send thee to him; and if he still make thee the same\r\nanswer, ask him to whom I send thee, [an it be not to him.]'\r\nAccordingly, the servant went back to the baker and said to him,\r\n'Cisti, for certain Messer Geri sendeth me to thee and none other.'\r\n'For certain, my son,' answered the baker, 'he doth it not.' 'Then,'\r\nsaid the man, 'to whom doth he send me?' 'To the Arno,' replied Cisti;\r\nwhich answer when the servant reported to Messer Geri, the eyes of his\r\nunderstanding were of a sudden opened and he said to the man, 'Let me\r\nsee what flask thou carriedst thither.'\r\n\r\nWhen he saw the great flagon aforesaid, he said, 'Cisti saith sooth,'\r\nand giving the man a sharp reproof, made him take a sortable flask,\r\nwhich when Cisti saw, 'Now,' quoth he, 'I know full well that he\r\nsendeth thee to me,' and cheerfully filled it unto him. Then, that\r\nsame day, he let fill a little cask with the like wine and causing\r\ncarry it softly to Messer Geri's house, went presently thither and\r\nfinding him there, said to him, 'Sir. I would not have you think that\r\nthe great flagon of this morning frightened me; nay, but, meseeming\r\nthat which I have of these past days shown you with my little pitchers\r\nhad escaped your mind, to wit, that this is no household wine,[300] I\r\nwished to recall it to you. But, now, for that I purpose no longer to\r\nbe your steward thereof, I have sent it all to you; henceforward do\r\nwith it as it pleaseth you.' Messer Geri set great store by Cisti's\r\npresent and rendering him such thanks as he deemed sortable, ever\r\nafter held him for a man of great worth and for friend.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 300: Lit. Family wine (_vin da famiglia_), _i.e._ no wine\r\nfor servants' or general drinking, but a choice vintage, to be\r\nreserved for special occasions.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Sixth]\r\n\r\n     MADAM NONNA DE' PULCI, WITH A READY RETORT TO A NOT\r\n     ALTOGETHER SEEMLY PLEASANTRY, IMPOSETH SILENCE ON THE BISHOP\r\n     OF FLORENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nPampinea having made an end of her story and both Cisti's reply and\r\nhis liberality having been much commended of all, it pleased the queen\r\nthat the next story should be told by Lauretta, who blithely began as\r\nfollows, \"Jocund ladies, first Pampinea and now Filomena have spoken\r\ntruly enough touching our little worth and the excellence of pithy\r\nsayings, whereto that there may be no need now to return, I would\r\nfain remind you, over and above that which hath been said on the\r\nsubject, that the nature of smart sayings is such that they should\r\nbite upon the hearer, not as the dog, but as the sheep biteth; for\r\nthat, an a trait bit like a dog, it were not a trait, but an affront.\r\nThe right mean in this was excellently well hit both by Madam Oretta's\r\nspeech and Cisti's reply. It is true that, if a smart thing be said by\r\nway of retort, and the answerer biteth like a dog, having been bitten\r\non like wise, meseemeth he is not to be blamed as he would have been,\r\nhad this not been the case; wherefore it behoveth us look how and with\r\nwhom, no less than when and where, we bandy jests; to which\r\nconsiderations, a prelate of ours, taking too little heed, received at\r\nleast as sharp a bite as he thought to give, as I shall show you in a\r\nlittle story.\r\n\r\nMesser Antonio d'Orso, a learned and worthy prelate, being Bishop of\r\nFlorence, there came thither a Catalan gentleman, called Messer Dego\r\ndella Ratta, marshal for King Robert, who, being a man of a very fine\r\nperson and a great amorist, took a liking to one among other\r\nFlorentine ladies, a very fair lady and granddaughter to a brother of\r\nthe said bishop, and hearing that her husband, albeit a man of good\r\nfamily, was very sordid and miserly, agreed with him to give him five\r\nhundred gold florins, so he would suffer him lie a night with his\r\nwife. Accordingly, he let gild so many silver poplins,[301] a coin\r\nwhich was then current, and having lain with the lady, though against\r\nher will, gave them to the husband. The thing after coming to be known\r\neverywhere, the sordid wretch of a husband reaped both loss and scorn,\r\nbut the bishop, like a discreet man as he was, affected to know\r\nnothing of the matter. Wherefore, he and the marshal consorting much\r\ntogether, it chanced, as they rode side by side with each other, one\r\nSt. John's Day, viewing the ladies on either side of the way where the\r\nmantle is run for,[302] the prelate espied a young lady,--of whom this\r\npresent pestilence hath bereft us and whom all you ladies must have\r\nknown, Madam Nonna de' Pulci by name, cousin to Messer Alessio\r\nRinucci, a fresh and fair young woman, both well-spoken and\r\nhigh-spirited, then not long before married in Porta San Piero,--and\r\npointed her out to the marshal; then, being near her, he laid his hand\r\non the latter's shoulder and said to her, 'Nonna, how deemest thou of\r\nthis gallant? Thinkest thou thou couldst make a conquest of him?' It\r\nseemed to the lady that those words somewhat trenched upon her honour\r\nand were like to sully it in the eyes of those (and there were many\r\nthere) who heard them; wherefore, not thinking to purge away the soil,\r\nbut to return blow for blow, she promptly answered, 'Maybe, sir, he\r\nwould not make a conquest of me; but, in any case, I should want good\r\nmoney.' The marshal and the bishop, hearing this, felt themselves\r\nalike touched to the quick by her speech, the one as the author of\r\nthe cheat put upon the bishop's brother's granddaughter and the other\r\nas having suffered the affront in the person of his kinswoman, and\r\nmade off, shamefast and silent, without looking at one another or\r\nsaying aught more to her that day. Thus, then, the young lady having\r\nbeen bitten, it was not forbidden her to bite her biter with a\r\nretort.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 301: A silver coin of about the size and value of our silver\r\npenny, which, when gilded, would pass muster well enough for a gold\r\nflorin, unless closely examined.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 302: _Il palio_, a race anciently run at Florence on St.\r\nJohn's Day, as that of the Barberi at Rome during the Carnival.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Sixth]\r\n\r\n     CHICHIBIO, COOK TO CURRADO GIANFIGLIAZZI, WITH A READY WORD\r\n     SPOKEN TO SAVE HIMSELF, TURNETH HIS MASTER'S ANGER INTO\r\n     LAUGHTER AND ESCAPETH THE PUNISHMENT THREATENED HIM BY THE\r\n     LATTER\r\n\r\n\r\nLauretta being silent and Nonna having been mightily commended of all,\r\nthe queen charged Neifile to follow on, and she said, \"Although,\r\nlovesome ladies, a ready wit doth often furnish folk with words both\r\nprompt and useful and goodly, according to the circumstances, yet\r\nfortune whiles cometh to the help of the fearful and putteth of a\r\nsudden into their mouths such answers as might never of malice\r\naforethought be found of the speaker, as I purpose to show you by my\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nCurrado Gianfigliazzi, as each of you ladies may have both heard and\r\nseen, hath still been a noble citizen of our city, liberal and\r\nmagnificent, and leading a knightly life, hath ever, letting be for\r\nthe present his weightier doings, taken delight in hawks and hounds.\r\nHaving one day with a falcon of his brought down a crane and finding\r\nit young and fat, he sent it to a good cook he had, a Venetian hight\r\nChichibio, bidding him roast it for supper and dress it well.\r\nChichibio, who looked the new-caught gull he was, trussed the crane\r\nand setting it to the fire, proceeded to cook it diligently. When it\r\nwas all but done and gave out a very savoury smell, it chanced that a\r\nwench of the neighbourhood, Brunetta by name, of whom Chichibio was\r\nsore enamoured, entered the kitchen and smelling the crane and seeing\r\nit, instantly besought him to give her a thigh thereof. He answered\r\nher, singing, and said, 'Thou shalt not have it from me, Mistress\r\nBrunetta, thou shalt not have it from me.' Whereat she, being vexed,\r\nsaid to him, 'By God His faith, an thou give it me not, thou shalt\r\nnever have of me aught that shall pleasure thee.' In brief, many were\r\nthe words between them and at last, Chichibio, not to anger his\r\nmistress, cut off one of the thighs of the crane and gave it her.\r\n\r\nThe bird being after set before Messer Currado and certain stranger\r\nguests of his, lacking a thigh, and the former marvelling thereat, he\r\nlet call Chichibio and asked him what was come of the other thigh;\r\nwhereto the liar of a Venetian answered without hesitation, 'Sir,\r\ncranes have but one thigh and one leg.' 'What a devil?' cried Currado\r\nin a rage. 'They have but one thigh and one leg? Have I never seen a\r\ncrane before?' 'Sir,' replied Chichibio, 'it is as I tell you, and\r\nwhenas it pleaseth you, I will cause you see it in the quick.'\r\nCurrado, out of regard for the strangers he had with him, chose not to\r\nmake more words of the matter, but said, 'Since thou sayst thou wilt\r\ncause me see it in the quick, a thing I never yet saw or heard tell\r\nof, I desire to see it to-morrow morning, in which case I shall be\r\ncontent; but I swear to thee, by Christ His body, that, an it be\r\notherwise, I will have thee served on such wise that thou shalt still\r\nhave cause to remember my name to thy sorrow so long as thou livest.'\r\nThere was an end of the talk for that night; but, next morning, as\r\nsoon as it was day, Currado, whose anger was nothing abated for sleep,\r\narose, still full of wrath, and bade bring the horses; then, mounting\r\nChichibio upon a rouncey, he carried him off towards a watercourse, on\r\nwhose banks cranes were still to be seen at break of day, saying, 'We\r\nshall soon see who lied yestereve, thou or I.'\r\n\r\nChichibio, seeing that his master's wrath yet endured and that needs\r\nmust be made good his lie and knowing not how he should avail\r\nthereunto, rode after Currado in the greatest fright that might be,\r\nand fain would he have fled, so but he might. But, seeing no way of\r\nescape, he looked now before him and now behind and now on either side\r\nand took all he saw for cranes standing on two feet. Presently, coming\r\nnear to the river, he chanced to catch sight, before any other, of a\r\nround dozen of cranes on the bank, all perched on one leg, as they use\r\nto do, when they sleep; whereupon he straightway showed them to\r\nCurrado, saying, 'Now, sir, if you look at those that stand yonder,\r\nyou may very well see that I told you the truth yesternight, to wit,\r\nthat cranes have but one thigh and one leg.' Currado, seeing them,\r\nanswered, 'Wait and I will show thee that they have two,' and going\r\nsomewhat nearer to them, he cried out, 'Ho! Ho!' At this the cranes,\r\nputting down the other leg, all, after some steps, took to flight;\r\nwhereupon Currado said to him, 'How sayst thou now, malapert knave\r\nthat thou art? Deemest thou they have two legs?' Chichibio, all\r\nconfounded and knowing not whether he stood on his head or his\r\nheels,[303] answered, 'Ay, sir; but you did not cry, \"Ho! Ho!\" to\r\nyesternight's crane; had you cried thus, it would have put out the\r\nother thigh and the other leg, even as did those yonder.' This reply\r\nso tickled Currado that all his wrath was changed into mirth and\r\nlaughter and he said, 'Chichibio, thou art in the right; indeed, I\r\nshould have done it.' Thus, then, with his prompt and comical answer\r\ndid Chichibio avert ill luck and made his peace with his master.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 303: Lit. knowing not whence himself came.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Sixth]\r\n\r\n     MESSER FORESE DA RABATTA AND MASTER GIOTTO THE PAINTER\r\n     COMING FROM MUGELLO, EACH JESTINGLY RALLIETH THE OTHER ON\r\n     HIS SCURVY FAVOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nNeifile being silent and the ladies having taken much pleasure in\r\nChichibio's reply, Pamfilo, by the queen's desire, spoke thus:\r\n\"Dearest ladies, it chanceth often that, like as fortune whiles hideth\r\nvery great treasures of worth and virtue under mean conditions, as\r\nhath been a little before shown by Pampinea, even so, under the\r\nsorriest of human forms are marvellous wits found to have been lodged\r\nby nature; and this very plainly appeared in two townsmen of ours, of\r\nwhom I purpose briefly to entertain you. For that the one, who was\r\ncalled Messer Forese da Rabatta, though little of person and\r\nmisshapen, with a flat camoys face, that had been an eyesore on the\r\nshoulders of the foulest cadger in Florence, was yet of such\r\nexcellence in the interpretation of the laws, that he was of many men\r\nof worth reputed a very treasury of civil right; whilst the other,\r\nwhose name was Giotto, had so excellent a genius that there was\r\nnothing of all which Nature, mother and mover of all things,\r\npresenteth unto us by the ceaseless revolution of the heavens, but he\r\nwith pencil and pen and brush depicted it and that so closely that not\r\nlike, nay, but rather the thing itself it seemed, insomuch that men's\r\nvisual sense is found to have been oftentimes deceived in things of\r\nhis fashion, taking that for real which was but depictured. Wherefore,\r\nhe having brought back to the light this art, which had for many an\r\nage lain buried under the errors of certain folk who painted more to\r\ndivert the eyes of the ignorant than to please the understanding of\r\nthe judicious, he may deservedly be styled one of the chief glories of\r\nFlorence, the more so that he bore the honours he had gained with the\r\nutmost humility and although, while he lived, chief over all else in\r\nhis art, he still refused to be called master, which title, though\r\nrejected by him, shone so much the more gloriously in him as it was\r\nwith greater eagerness greedily usurped by those who knew less than\r\nhe, or by his disciples. Yet, great as was his skill, he was not\r\ntherefore anywise goodlier of person or better favoured than Messer\r\nForese. But, to come to my story:\r\n\r\nI must tell you that Messer Forese and Giotto had each his country\r\nhouse at Mugello and the former, having gone to visit his estates, at\r\nthat season of the summer when the Courts hold holiday, and returning\r\nthence on a sorry cart-horse, chanced to fall in with the aforesaid\r\nGiotto, who had been on the same errand and was then on his way back\r\nto Florence nowise better equipped than himself in horse and\r\naccoutrements. Accordingly, they joined company and fared on softly,\r\nlike old men as they were. Presently, it chanced, as we often see it\r\nhappen in summer time, that a sudden shower overtook them, from which,\r\nas quickliest they might, they took shelter in the house of a\r\nhusbandman, a friend and acquaintance of both of them. After awhile,\r\nthe rain showing no sign of giving over and they wishing to reach\r\nFlorence by daylight, they borrowed of their host two old homespun\r\ncloaks and two hats, rusty with age, for that there were no better to\r\nbe had, and set out again upon their way.\r\n\r\nWhen they had gone awhile and were all drenched and bemired with the\r\nsplashing that their hackneys kept up with their hoofs--things which\r\nuse not to add worship to any one's looks,--the weather began to clear\r\na little and the two wayfarers, who had long fared on in silence, fell\r\nto conversing together. Messer Forese, as he rode, hearkening to\r\nGiotto, who was a very fine talker, fell to considering his companion\r\nfrom head to foot and seeing him everywise so ill accoutred and in\r\nsuch scurvy case, burst out laughing and without taking any thought to\r\nhis own plight, said to him, 'How sayst thou, Giotto? An there\r\nencountered us here a stranger who had never seen thee, thinkest thou\r\nhe would believe thee to be, as thou art, the finest painter in the\r\nworld?' 'Ay, sir,' answered Giotto forthright, 'methinketh he might\r\ne'en believe it whenas, looking upon you, he should believe that you\r\nknew your A B C.' Messer Forese, hearing this, was sensible of his\r\nerror and saw himself paid with money such as the wares he had\r\nsold.\"[304]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 304: Or, as we should say, \"in his own coin.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Sixth]\r\n\r\n     MICHELE SCALZA PROVETH TO CERTAIN YOUNG MEN THAT THE CADGERS\r\n     OF FLORENCE ARE THE BEST GENTLEMEN OF THE WORLD OR THE\r\n     MAREMMA AND WINNETH A SUPPER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ladies yet laughed at Giotto's prompt retort, when the queen\r\ncharged Fiammetta follow on and she proceeded to speak thus: \"Young\r\nladies, the mention by Pamfilo of the cadgers of Florence, whom\r\nperadventure you know not as doth he, hath brought to my mind a story,\r\nwherein, without deviating from our appointed theme, it is\r\ndemonstrated how great is their nobility; and it pleaseth me,\r\ntherefore, to relate it.\r\n\r\nIt is no great while since there was in our city a young man called\r\nMichele Scalza, who was the merriest and most agreeable man in the\r\nworld and he had still the rarest stories in hand, wherefore the young\r\nFlorentines were exceeding glad to have his company whenas they made a\r\nparty of pleasure amongst themselves. It chanced one day, he being\r\nwith certain folk at Monte Ughi, that the question was started among\r\nthem of who were the best and oldest gentlemen of Florence. Some said\r\nthe Uberti, others the Lamberti, and one this family and another that,\r\naccording as it occurred to his mind; which Scalza hearing, he fell\r\na-laughing and said, 'Go to, addlepates that you are! You know not\r\nwhat you say. The best gentlemen and the oldest, not only of Florence,\r\nbut of all the world or the Maremma,[305] are the Cadgers,[306] a\r\nmatter upon which all the phisopholers and every one who knoweth them,\r\nas I do, are of accord; and lest you should understand it of others, I\r\nspeak of the Cadgers your neighbors of Santa Maria Maggiore.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 305: A commentator notes that the adjunction to the world of\r\nthe Maremma (cf. Elijer Goff, \"The Irish Question has for some\r\ncenturies been enjoyed by _the universe and other parts_\") produces a\r\nrisible effect and gives the reader to understand that Scalza broaches\r\nthe question only by way of a joke. The same may be said of the\r\njesting inversion of the word philosophers (phisopholers, Fisofoli) in\r\nthe next line.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 306: _Baronci_, the Florentine name for what we should call\r\nprofessional beggars, \"mumpers, chanters and Abrahammen,\" called\r\n_Bari_ and _Barocci_ in other parts of Italy. This story has been a\r\nprodigious stumbling-block to former translators, not one of whom\r\nappears to have had the slightest idea of Boccaccio's meaning.]\r\n\r\nWhen the young men, who looked for him to say otherwhat, heard this,\r\nthey all made mock of him and said, 'Thou gullest us, as if we knew\r\nnot the Cadgers, even as thou dost.' 'By the Evangels,' replied\r\nScalza, 'I gull you not; nay, I speak the truth, and if there be any\r\nhere who will lay a supper thereon, to be given to the winner and half\r\na dozen companions of his choosing, I will willingly hold the wager;\r\nand I will do yet more for you, for I will abide by the judgment of\r\nwhomsoever you will.' Quoth one of them, called Neri Mannini, 'I am\r\nready to try to win the supper in question'; whereupon, having agreed\r\ntogether to take Piero di Fiorentino, in whose house they were, to\r\njudge, they betook themselves to him, followed by all the rest, who\r\nlooked to see Scalza lose and to make merry over his discomfiture, and\r\nrecounted to him all that had passed. Piero, who was a discreet young\r\nman, having first heard Neri's argument, turned to Scalza and said to\r\nhim, 'And thou, how canst thou prove this that thou affirmest?' 'How,\r\nsayest thou?' answered Scalza. 'Nay, I will prove it by such reasoning\r\nthat not only thou, but he who denieth it, shall acknowledge that I\r\nspeak sooth. You know that, the ancienter men are, the nobler they\r\nare; and so was it said but now among these. Now the Cadgers are more\r\nancient than any one else, so that they are nobler; and showing you\r\nhow they are the most ancient, I shall undoubtedly have won the wager.\r\nYou must know, then, that the Cadgers were made by God the Lord in the\r\ndays when He first began to learn to draw; but the rest of mankind\r\nwere made after He knew how to draw. And to assure yourselves that in\r\nthis I say sooth, do but consider the Cadgers in comparison with other\r\nfolk; whereas you see all the rest of mankind with faces well composed\r\nand duly proportioned, you may see the Cadgers, this with a visnomy\r\nvery long and strait and with a face out of all measure broad; one\r\nhath too long and another too short a nose and a third hath a chin\r\njutting out and turned upward and huge jawbones that show as they were\r\nthose of an ass, whilst some there be who have one eye bigger than the\r\nother and other some who have one set lower than the other, like the\r\nfaces that children used to make, whenas they first begin to learn to\r\ndraw. Wherefore, as I have already said, it is abundantly apparent\r\nthat God the Lord made them, what time He was learning to draw; so\r\nthat they are more ancient and consequently nobler than the rest of\r\nmankind.' At this, both Piero, who was the judge, and Neri, who had\r\nwagered the supper, and all the rest, hearing Scalza's comical\r\nargument and remembering themselves,[307] fell all a-laughing and\r\naffirmed that he was in the right and had won the supper, for that the\r\nCadgers were assuredly the noblest and most ancient gentlemen that\r\nwere to be found not in Florence alone, but in the world or the\r\nMaremma. Wherefore it was very justly said of Pamfilo, seeking to show\r\nthe foulness of Messer Forese's visnomy, that it would have showed\r\nnotably ugly on one of the Cadgers.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 307: _i.e._ of the comical fashion of the Cadgers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Sixth]\r\n\r\n     MADAM FILIPPA, BEING FOUND BY HER HUSBAND WITH A LOVER OF\r\n     HERS AND BROUGHT TO JUSTICE, DELIVERETH HERSELF WITH A\r\n     PROMPT AND PLEASANT ANSWER AND CAUSETH MODIFY THE STATUTE\r\n\r\n\r\nFiammetta was now silent and all laughed yet at the novel argument\r\nused by Scalza for the ennoblement over all of the Cadgers, when the\r\nqueen enjoined Filostrato to tell and he accordingly began to say, \"It\r\nis everywise a fine thing, noble ladies, to know how to speak well,\r\nbut I hold it yet goodlier to know how to do it whereas necessity\r\nrequireth it, even as a gentlewoman, of whom I purpose to entertain\r\nyou, knew well how to do on such wise that not only did she afford her\r\nhearers matter for mirth and laughter, but did herself loose from the\r\ntoils of an ignominious death, as you shall presently hear.\r\n\r\nThere was, then, aforetime, in the city of Prato, a statute in truth\r\nno less blameworthy than cruel, which, without making any distinction,\r\nordained that any woman found by her husband in adultery with any her\r\nlover should be burnt, even as she who should be discovered to have\r\nsold her favours for money. What while this statute was in force, it\r\nbefell that a noble and beautiful lady, by name Madam Filippa, who was\r\nof a singularly amorous complexion, was one night found by Rinaldo de'\r\nPugliesi her husband, in her own chamber in the arms of Lazzerino de'\r\nGuazzagliotri, a noble and handsome youth of that city, whom she loved\r\neven as herself. Rinaldo, seeing this, was sore enraged and scarce\r\ncontained himself from falling upon them and slaying them; and but\r\nthat he feared for himself, an he should ensue the promptings of his\r\nanger, he had certainly done it. However, he forbore from this, but\r\ncould not refrain from seeking of the law of Prato that which it was\r\nnot permitted him to accomplish with his own hand, to wit, the death\r\nof his wife. Having, therefore, very sufficient evidence to prove the\r\nlady's default, no sooner was the day come than, without taking other\r\ncounsel, he lodged an accusation against her and caused summon her\r\nbefore the provost.\r\n\r\nMadam Filippa, being great of heart, as women commonly are who are\r\nverily in love, resolved, although counselled to the contrary by many\r\nof her friends and kinsfolk, to appear, choosing rather, confessing\r\nthe truth, to die with an undaunted spirit, than, meanly fleeing, to\r\nlive an outlaw in exile and confess herself unworthy of such a lover\r\nas he in whose arms she had been the foregoing night. Wherefore,\r\npresenting herself before the provost, attended by a great company of\r\nmen and ladies and exhorted of all to deny the charge, she demanded,\r\nwith a firm voice and an assured air, what he would with her. The\r\nmagistrate, looking upon her and seeing her very fair and commendable\r\nof carriage and according as her words testified, of a lofty spirit,\r\nbegan to have compassion of her, fearing lest she should confess\r\nsomewhat wherefore it should behoove him, for his own honour's sake,\r\ncondemn her to die. However, having no choice but to question her of\r\nthat which was laid to her charge, he said to her, 'Madam, as you see,\r\nhere is Rinaldo your husband, who complaineth of you, avouching\r\nhimself to have found you in adultery with another man and demanding\r\nthat I should punish you therefor by putting you to death, according\r\nto the tenor of a statute which here obtaineth; but this I cannot do,\r\nexcept you confess it; wherefore look well what you answer and tell me\r\nif that be true whereof your husband impeacheth you.'\r\n\r\nThe lady, no wise dismayed, replied very cheerfully, 'Sir, true it is\r\nthat Rinaldo is my husband and that he found me last night in the arms\r\nof Lazzarino, wherein, for the great and perfect love I bear him, I\r\nhave many a time been; nor am I anywise minded to deny this. But, as I\r\nam assured you know, laws should be common to all and made with the\r\nconsent of those whom they concern; and this is not the case with this\r\nstatute, which is binding only upon us unhappy women, who might far\r\nbetter than men avail to satisfy many; more by token that, when it was\r\nmade, not only did no woman yield consent thereunto, but none of us\r\nwas even cited to do so; wherefore it may justly be styled naught.\r\nHowever, an you choose, to the prejudice of my body and of your own\r\nsoul, to be the executor of this unrighteous law, it resteth with you\r\nto do so; but, ere you proceed to adjudge aught, I pray you do me one\r\nslight favour, to wit, that you question my husband if at all times\r\nand as often as it pleased him, without ever saying him nay, I have or\r\nnot vouchsafed him entire commodity of myself.'\r\n\r\nRinaldo, without waiting to be questioned of the provost, straightway\r\nmade answer that undoubtedly the lady had, at his every request,\r\naccorded him his every pleasure of herself; whereupon, 'Then, my lord\r\nprovost,' straightway rejoined she, 'if he have still taken of me that\r\nwhich was needful and pleasing to him, what, I ask you, was or am I to\r\ndo with that which remaineth over and above his requirements? Should I\r\ncast it to the dogs? Was it not far better to gratify withal a\r\ngentleman who loveth me more than himself, than to leave it waste or\r\nspoil?' Now well nigh all the people of Prato had flocked thither to\r\nthe trial of such a matter and of so fair and famous a lady, and\r\nhearing so comical a question, they all, after much laughter, cried\r\nout as with one voice that she was in the right of it and that she\r\nsaid well. Moreover, ere they departed thence, at the instance of the\r\nprovost, they modified the cruel statute and left it to apply to those\r\nwomen only who should for money make default to their husbands.\r\nThereupon Rinaldo, having taken nought but shame by so fond an\r\nemprise, departed the court, and the lady returned in triumph to her\r\nown house, joyful and free and in a manner raised up out of the fire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Sixth]\r\n\r\n     FRESCO EXHORTETH HIS NIECE NOT TO MIRROR HERSELF IN THE\r\n     GLASS, IF, AS SHE SAITH, IT IRKETH HER TO SEE DISAGREEABLE\r\n     FOLK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story told by Filostrato at first touched the hearts of the\r\nlistening ladies with some little shamefastness and they gave token\r\nthereof by a modest redness that appeared upon their faces; but, after\r\nlooking one at another, they hearkened thereto, tittering the while\r\nand scarce able to abstain from laughing. As soon as he was come to\r\nthe end thereof, the queen turned to Emilia and bade her follow on,\r\nwhereupon, sighing no otherwise than as she had been aroused from a\r\ndream, she began, \"Lovesome lasses, for that long thought hath held me\r\nfar from here, I shall, to obey our queen content myself with\r\n[relating] a story belike much slighter than that which I might have\r\nbethought myself to tell, had my mind been present here, recounting to\r\nyou the silly default of a damsel, corrected by an uncle of hers with\r\na jocular retort, had she been woman enough to have apprehended it.\r\n\r\nA certain Fresco da Celatico, then, had a niece familiarly called\r\nCiesca,[308] who, having a comely face and person (though none of\r\nthose angelical beauties that we have often seen aforetime), set so\r\nmuch store by herself and accounted herself so noble that she had\r\ngotten a habit of carping at both men and women and everything she\r\nsaw, without anywise taking thought to herself, who was so much more\r\nfashous, froward and humoursome than any other of her sex that nothing\r\ncould be done to her liking. Beside all this, she was so prideful\r\nthat, had she been of the blood royal of France, it had been\r\noverweening; and when she went abroad, she gave herself so many airs\r\nthat she did nought but make wry faces, as if there came to her a\r\nstench from whomsoever she saw or met. But, letting be many other\r\nvexatious and tiresome fashions of hers, it chanced one day that she\r\ncame back to the house, where Fresco was, and seating herself near\r\nhim, all full of airs and grimaces, did nothing but puff and blow;\r\nwhereupon quoth he, 'What meaneth this, Ciesca, that, to-day being a\r\nholiday, thou comest home so early?' To which she answered, all like\r\nto die away with affectation, 'It is true I have come back soon, for\r\nthat I believe there were never in this city so many disagreeable and\r\ntiresome people, both men and women, as there are to-day; there\r\npasseth none about the streets but is hateful to me as ill-chance, and\r\nI do not believe there is a woman in the world to whom it is more\r\nirksome to see disagreeable folk than it is to me; wherefore I have\r\nreturned thus early, not to see them.' 'My lass,' rejoined Fresco, to\r\nwhom his niece's airs and graces were mighty displeasing, 'if\r\ndisagreeable folk be so distasteful to thee as thou sayest, never\r\nmirror thyself in the glass, so thou wouldst live merry.' But she,\r\nemptier than a reed, albeit herseemed she was a match for Solomon in\r\nwit, apprehended Fresco's true speech no better than a block; nay, she\r\nsaid that she chose to mirror herself in the glass like other women;\r\nand so she abode in her folly and therein abideth yet.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 308: An abbreviation of Francesca.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NINTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Sixth]\r\n\r\n     GUIDO CAVALCANTI WITH A PITHY SPEECH COURTEOUSLY FLOUTETH\r\n     CERTAIN FLORENTINE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD TAKEN HIM BY SURPRISE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe queen, seeing Emilia delivered of her story and that it rested\r\nwith none other than herself to tell, saving him who was privileged to\r\nspeak last, began thus, \"Although, sprightly ladies, you have this day\r\ntaken out of my mouth at the least two stories, whereof I had purposed\r\nto relate one, I have yet one left to tell, the end whereof compriseth\r\na saying of such a fashion that none, peradventure, of such\r\npertinence, hath yet been cited to us.\r\n\r\nYou must know, then, that there were in our city, of times past, many\r\ngoodly and commendable usances, whereof none is left there nowadays,\r\nthanks to the avarice that hath waxed therein with wealth and hath\r\nbanished them all. Among these there was a custom to the effect that\r\nthe gentlemen of the various quarters of Florence assembled together\r\nin divers places about the town and formed themselves into companies\r\nof a certain number, having a care to admit thereinto such only as\r\nmight aptly bear the expense, whereof to-day the one and to-morrow the\r\nother, and so all in turn, hold open house, each his day, for the\r\nwhole company. At these banquets they often entertained both stranger\r\ngentlemen, whenas there came any thither, and those of the city; and\r\non like wise, once at the least in the year, they clad themselves\r\nalike and rode in procession through the city on the most notable days\r\nand whiles they held passes of arms, especially on the chief holidays\r\nor whenas some glad news of victory or the like came to the city.\r\n\r\nAmongst these companies was one of Messer Betto Brunelleschi,\r\nwhereinto the latter and his companions had studied amain to draw\r\nGuido, son of Messer Cavalcante de' Cavalcanti, and not without cause;\r\nfor that, besides being one of the best logicians in the world and an\r\nexcellent natural philosopher (of which things, indeed, they recked\r\nlittle), he was very sprightly and well-bred and a mighty well-spoken\r\nman and knew better than any other to do everything that he would and\r\nthat pertained unto a gentleman, more by token that he was very rich\r\nand knew wonder-well how to entertain whomsoever he deemed deserving\r\nof honour. But Messer Betto had never been able to win and to have\r\nhim, and he and his companions believed that this betided for that\r\nGuido, being whiles engaged in abstract speculations, became much\r\ndistraught from mankind; and for that he inclined somewhat to the\r\nopinion of the Epicureans, it was reported among the common folk that\r\nthese his speculations consisted only in seeking if it might be\r\ndiscovered that God was not.\r\n\r\nIt chanced one day that Guido set out from Orto San Michele and came\r\nby way of the Corso degli Ademari, the which was oftentimes his road,\r\nto San Giovanni, round about which there were at that present divers\r\ngreat marble tombs (which are nowadays at Santa Reparata) and many\r\nothers. As he was between the columns of porphyry there and the tombs\r\nin question and the door of the church, which was shut, Messer Betto\r\nand his company, coming a-horseback along the Piazza di Santa\r\nReparata, espied him among the tombs and said, 'Let us go plague him.'\r\nAccordingly, spurring their horses, they charged all down upon him in\r\nsport and coming upon him ere he was aware of them, said to him,\r\n'Guido, thou refusest to be of our company; but, harkye, whenas thou\r\nshalt have found that God is not, what wilt thou have accomplished?'\r\nGuido, seeing himself hemmed in by them, answered promptly,\r\n'Gentlemen, you may say what you will to me in your own house'; then,\r\nlaying his hand on one of the great tombs aforesaid and being very\r\nnimble of body, he took a spring and alighting on the other side, made\r\noff, having thus rid himself of them.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen abode looking one upon another and fell a-saying that he\r\nwas a crack-brain and that this that he had answered them amounted to\r\nnought seeing that there where they were they had no more to do than\r\nall the other citizens, nor Guido himself less than any of themselves.\r\nBut Messer Betto turned to them and said, 'It is you who are the\r\ncrackbrains, if you have not apprehended him. He hath courteously and\r\nin a few words given us the sharpest rebuke in the world; for that, an\r\nyou consider aright, these tombs are the houses of the dead, seeing\r\nthey are laid and abide therein, and these, saith he, are our house,\r\nmeaning thus to show us that we and other foolish and unlettered men\r\nare, compared with him and other men of learning, worse than dead\r\nfolk; wherefore, being here, we are in our own house.' Thereupon each\r\nunderstood what Guido had meant to say and was abashed nor ever\r\nplagued him more, but held Messer Betto thenceforward a gentleman of a\r\nsubtle wit and an understanding.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TENTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Sixth]\r\n\r\n     FRA CIPOLLA PROMISETH CERTAIN COUNTRY FOLK TO SHOW THEM ONE\r\n     OF THE ANGEL GABRIEL'S FEATHERS AND FINDING COALS IN PLACE\r\n     THEREOF, AVOUCHETH THESE LATTER TO BE OF THOSE WHICH ROASTED\r\n     ST. LAWRENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nEach of the company being now quit of his[309] story, Dioneo perceived\r\nthat it rested with him to tell; whereupon, without awaiting more\r\nformal commandment, he began on this wise, silence having first been\r\nimposed on those who commended Guido's pregnant retort: \"Charming\r\nladies, albeit I am privileged to speak of that which most liketh me,\r\nI purpose not to-day to depart from the matter whereof you have all\r\nvery aptly spoken; but, ensuing in your footsteps, I mean to show you\r\nhow cunningly a friar of the order of St. Anthony, by name Fra\r\nCipolla, contrived with a sudden shift to extricate himself from a\r\nsnare[310] which had been set for him by two young men; nor should it\r\nirk you if, for the complete telling of the story, I enlarge somewhat\r\nin speaking, an you consider the sun, which is yet amiddleward in the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 309: \"Or her.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 310: Lit. to avoid or elude a scorn (_fuggire uno scorno_).]\r\n\r\nCertaldo, as you may have heard, is a burgh of Val d' Elsa situate in\r\nour country, which, small though it be, was once inhabited by\r\ngentlemen and men of substance; and thither, for that he found good\r\npasture there, one of the friars of the order of St. Anthony was long\r\nused to resort once a year, to get in the alms bestowed by simpletons\r\nupon him and his brethren. His name was Fra Cipolla and he was gladly\r\nseen there, no less belike, for his name's sake[311] than for other\r\nreasons, seeing that these parts produce onions that are famous\r\nthroughout all Tuscany. This Fra Cipolla was little of person,\r\nred-haired and merry of countenance, the jolliest rascal in the world,\r\nand to boot, for all he was no scholar, he was so fine a talker and so\r\nready of wit that those who knew him not would not only have esteemed\r\nhim a great rhetorician, but had avouched him to be Tully himself or\r\nmay be Quintilian; and he was gossip or friend or well-wisher[312] to\r\nwell nigh every one in the country.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 311: _Cipolla_ means onion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 312: The term \"well-wisher\" (_benivogliente_), when\r\nunderstood in relation to a woman, is generally equivalent (at least\r\nwith the older Italian writers) to \"lover.\" See ante, passim.]\r\n\r\nOne August among others he betook himself thither according to his\r\nwont, and on a Sunday morning, all the goodmen and goodwives of the\r\nvillages around being come to hear mass at the parish church, he came\r\nforward, whenas it seemed to him time, and said, 'Gentlemen and\r\nladies, it is, as you know, your usance to send every year to the poor\r\nof our lord Baron St. Anthony of your corn and of your oats, this\r\nlittle and that much, according to his means and his devoutness, to\r\nthe intent that the blessed St. Anthony may keep watch over your\r\nbeeves and asses and swine and sheep; and besides this, you use to\r\npay, especially such of you as are inscribed into our company, that\r\nsmall due which is payable once a year. To collect these I have been\r\nsent by my superior, to wit, my lord abbot; wherefore, with the\r\nblessing of God, you shall, after none, whenas you hear the bells\r\nring, come hither without the church, where I will make preachment to\r\nyou after the wonted fashion and you shall kiss the cross; moreover,\r\nfor that I know you all to be great devotees of our lord St. Anthony,\r\nI will, as an especial favour show you a very holy and goodly relic,\r\nwhich I myself brought aforetime from the holy lands beyond seas; and\r\nthat is one of the Angel Gabriel's feathers, which remained in the\r\nVirgin Mary's chamber, whenas he came to announce to her in Nazareth.'\r\nThis said, he broke off and went on with his mass.\r\n\r\nNow, when he said this, there were in the church, among many others,\r\ntwo roguish young fellows, hight one Giovanni del Bragioniera and the\r\nother Biagio Pizzini, who, after laughing with one another awhile over\r\nFra Cipolla's relic, took counsel together, for all they were great\r\nfriends and cronies of his, to play him some trick in the matter of\r\nthe feather in question. Accordingly, having learned that he was to\r\ndine that morning with a friend of his in the burgh, they went down\r\ninto the street as soon as they knew him to be at table, and betook\r\nthemselves to the inn where he had alighted, purposing that Biagio\r\nshould hold his servant in parley, whilst Giovanni should search his\r\nbaggage for the feather aforesaid, whatever it might be, and carry it\r\noff, to see what he should say to the people of the matter.\r\n\r\nFra Cipolla had a servant, whom some called Guccio[313] Balena,[314]\r\nothers Guccio Imbratta[315] and yet others Guccia Porco[316] and who\r\nwas such a scurvy knave that Lipo Topo[317] never wrought his like,\r\ninasmuch as his master used oftentimes to jest of him with his cronies\r\nand say, 'My servant hath in him nine defaults, such that, were one of\r\nthem in Solomon or Aristotle or Seneca, it would suffice to mar all\r\ntheir worth, all their wit and all their sanctity. Consider, then,\r\nwhat a man he must be, who hath all nine of them and in whom there is\r\nneither worth nor wit nor sanctity.' Being questioned whiles what were\r\nthese nine defaults and having put them into doggerel rhyme, he would\r\nanswer, 'I will tell you. He's a liar, a sloven, a slugabed;\r\ndisobedient, neglectful, ill bred; o'erweening, foul-spoken, a\r\ndunderhead; beside which he hath divers other peccadilloes, whereof it\r\nbooteth not to speak. But what is most laughable of all his fashions\r\nis that, wherever he goeth, he is still for taking a wife and hiring a\r\nhouse; for, having a big black greasy beard, him-seemeth he is so\r\nexceeding handsome and agreeable that he conceiteth himself all the\r\nwomen who see him fall in love with him, and if you let him alone, he\r\nwould run after them all till he lost his girdle.[318] Sooth to say,\r\nhe is of great assistance to me, for that none can ever seek to speak\r\nwith me so secretly but he must needs hear his share; and if it chance\r\nthat I be questioned of aught, he is so fearful lest I should not know\r\nhow to answer, that he straightway answereth for me both Ay and No, as\r\nhe judgeth sortable.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 313: Diminutive of contempt of Arrigo, contracted from\r\nArriguccio, _i.e._ mean little Arrigo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 314: _i.e._ Whale.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 315: _i.e._ Dirt.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 316: _i.e._ Hog.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 317: A painter of Boccaccio's time, of whom little or\r\nnothing seems to be known.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 318: _Perpendo lo coreggia._ The exact meaning of this\r\npassage is not clear. The commentators make sundry random shots at it,\r\nbut, as usual, only succeed in making confusion worse confounded. It\r\nmay perhaps be rendered, \"till his wind failed him.\"]\r\n\r\nNow Fra Cipolla, in leaving him at the inn, had bidden him look well\r\nthat none touched his gear, and more particularly his saddle-bags, for\r\nthat therein were the sacred things. But Guccio, who was fonder of the\r\nkitchen than the nightingale of the green boughs, especially if he\r\nscented some serving-wench there, and who had seen in that of the inn\r\na gross fat cookmaid, undersized and ill-made, with a pair of paps\r\nthat showed like two manure-baskets and a face like a cadger's, all\r\nsweaty, greasy and smoky, leaving Fra Cipolla's chamber and all his\r\ngear to care for themselves, swooped down upon the kitchen, even as\r\nthe vulture swoopeth upon carrion, and seating himself by the fire,\r\nfor all it was August, entered into discourse with the wench in\r\nquestion, whose name was Nuta, telling her that he was by rights a\r\ngentleman and had more than nine millions of florins, beside that\r\nwhich he had to give others, which was rather more than less, and that\r\nhe could do and say God only knew what. Moreover, without regard to\r\nhis bonnet, whereon was grease enough to have seasoned the caldron of\r\nAltopascio,[319] and his doublet all torn and pieced and enamelled\r\nwith filth about the collar and under the armpits, with more spots and\r\npatches of divers colours than ever had Turkey or India stuffs, and\r\nhis shoes all broken and hose unsewn, he told her, as he had been the\r\nSieur de Châtillon,[320] that he meant to clothe her and trick her out\r\nanew and deliver her from the wretchedness of abiding with\r\nothers,[321] and bring her to hope of better fortune, if without any\r\ngreat wealth in possession, and many other things, which, for all he\r\ndelivered them very earnestly, all turned to wind and came to nought,\r\nas did most of his enterprises.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 319: Said by the commentators to have been an abbey, where\r\nthey made cheese-soup for all comers twice a week; hence \"the caldron\r\nof Altopascio\" became a proverb; but _quære_ is not the name\r\nAltopascio (high feeding) a fancy one?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 320: It does not appear to which member of this great house\r\nBoccaccio here alludes, but the Châtillons were always rich and\r\nmagnificent gentlemen, from Gaucher de Châtillon, who followed Philip\r\nAugustus to the third crusade, to the great Admiral de Coligny.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 321: Sic (_star con altrui_); but \"being in the service of\r\nor dependent upon others\" seems to be the probable meaning.]\r\n\r\nThe two young men, accordingly, found Guccio busy about Nuta, whereat\r\nthey were well pleased, for that it spared them half their pains, and\r\nentering Fra Cipolla's chamber, which they found open, the first thing\r\nthat came under their examination was the saddle-bags wherein was the\r\nfeather. In these they found, enveloped in a great taffetas wrapper,\r\na little casket and opening this latter, discovered therein a parrot's\r\ntail-feather, which they concluded must be that which the friar had\r\npromised to show the people of Certaldo. And certes he might lightly\r\ncause it to be believed in those days, for that the refinements of\r\nEgypt had not yet made their way save into a small part of Tuscany, as\r\nthey have since done in very great abundance, to the undoing of all\r\nItaly; and wherever they may have been some little known, in those\r\nparts they were well nigh altogether unknown of the inhabitants; nay\r\nthe rude honesty of the ancients yet enduring there, not only had they\r\nnever set eyes on a parrot, but were far from having ever heard tell\r\nof such a bird. The young men, then, rejoiced at finding the feather,\r\nlaid hands on it and not to leave the casket empty, filled it with\r\nsome coals they saw in a corner of the room and shut it again. Then,\r\nputting all things in order as they had found them, they made off in\r\nhigh glee with the feather, without having been seen, and began to\r\nawait what Fra Cipolli should say, when he found the coals in place\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nThe simple men and women who were in the church, hearing that they\r\nwere to see the Angel Gabriel's feather after none, returned home, as\r\nsoon as mass was over, and neighbor telling it to neighbor and gossip\r\nto gossip, no sooner had they all dined than so many men and women\r\nflocked to the burgh that it would scarce hold them, all looking\r\neagerly to see the aforesaid feather. Fra Cipolla, having well dined\r\nand after slept awhile, arose a little after none and hearing of the\r\ngreat multitude of country folk come to see the feather, sent to bid\r\nGuccio Imbratta come thither with the bells and bring his saddle-bags.\r\nGuccio, tearing himself with difficulty away from the kitchen and\r\nNuta, betook himself with the things required to the appointed place,\r\nwhither coming, out of breath, for that the water he had drunken had\r\nmade his belly swell amain, he repaired, by his master's commandment,\r\nto the church door and fell to ringing the bells lustily.\r\n\r\nWhen all the people were assembled there, Fra Cipolla, without\r\nobserving that aught of his had been meddled with, began his\r\npreachment and said many words anent his affairs; after which,\r\nthinking to come to the showing of the Angel Gabriel's feather, he\r\nfirst recited the Confiteor with the utmost solemnity and let kindle a\r\npair of flambeaux; then, pulling off his bonnet, he delicately\r\nunfolded the taffetas wrapper and brought out the casket. Having first\r\npronounced certain ejaculations in praise and commendation of the\r\nAngel Gabriel and of his relic, he opened the casket and seeing it\r\nfull of coals, suspected not Guccio Balena of having played him this\r\ntrick, for that he knew him not to be man enough; nor did he curse him\r\nfor having kept ill watch lest others should do it, but silently\r\ncursed himself for having committed to him the care of his gear,\r\nknowing him, as he did, to be negligent, disobedient, careless and\r\nforgetful.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, without changing colour, he raised his eyes and hands to\r\nheaven and said, so as to be heard of all, 'O God, praised be still\r\nthy puissance!' Then, shutting the casket and turning to the people,\r\n'Gentlemen and ladies,' quoth he, 'you must know that, whilst I was\r\nyet very young, I was dispatched by my superior to those parts where\r\nthe sun riseth and it was expressly commanded me that I should seek\r\ntill I found the Privileges of Porcellana, which, though they cost\r\nnothing to seal, are much more useful to others than to us. On this\r\nerrand I set out from Venice and passed through Borgo de' Greci,[322]\r\nwhence, riding through the kingdom of Algarve and Baldacca,[323] I\r\ncame to Parione,[324] and from there, not without thirst, I came after\r\nawhile into Sardinia. But what booteth it to set out to you in detail\r\nall the lands explored by me? Passing the straits of San Giorgio,[325]\r\nI came into Truffia[326] and Buffia,[327] countries much inhabited and\r\nwith great populations, and thence into the land of Menzogna,[328]\r\nwhere I found great plenty of our brethren and of friars of other\r\nreligious orders, who all went about those parts, shunning unease for\r\nthe love of God, recking little of others' travail, whenas they saw\r\ntheir own advantage to ensue, and spending none other money than such\r\nas was uncoined.[329] Thence I passed into the land of the Abruzzi,\r\nwhere the men and women go in clogs over the mountains, clothing the\r\nswine in their own guts;[330] and a little farther I found folk who\r\ncarried bread on sticks and wine in bags. From this I came to the\r\nMountains of the Bachi, where all the waters run down hill; and in\r\nbrief, I made my way so far inward that I won at last even to India\r\nPastinaca,[331] where I swear to you, by the habit I wear on my back,\r\nthat I saw hedge-bills[332] fly, a thing incredible to whoso hath not\r\nseen it. But of this Maso del Saggio will confirm me, whom I found\r\nthere a great merchant, cracking walnuts and selling the shells by\r\nretail.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 322: Apparently the Neapolitan town of that name.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 323: The name of a famous tavern in Florence (_Florio_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 324: _Quære_ a place in Florence? One of the commentators,\r\nwith characteristic carelessness, states that the places mentioned in\r\nthe preachment of Fra Cipolla (an amusing specimen of the\r\npatter-sermon of the mendicant friar of the middle ages, that\r\necclesiastical Cheap Jack of his day) are all names of streets or\r\nplaces of Florence, a statement which, it is evident to the most\r\ncursory reader, is altogether inaccurate.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 325: Apparently the island of that name near Venice.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 326: _i.e._ Nonsense-land.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 327: _i.e._ Land of Tricks or Cozenage.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 328: _i.e._ Falsehood, Lie-land.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 329: _i.e._ paying their way with fine words, instead of\r\ncoin.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 330: _i.e._ making sausages of them.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 331: _Bachi_, drones or maggots. _Pastinaca_ means \"parsnip\"\r\nand is a meaningless addition of Fra Cipolla's fashion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 332: A play of words upon the primary meaning (winged\r\nthings) of the word _pennate_, hedge-bills.]\r\n\r\nBeing unable to find that which I went seeking, for that thence one\r\ngoeth thither by water, I turned back and arrived in those holy\r\ncountries, where, in summer-years, cold bread is worth four farthings\r\na loaf and the hot goeth for nothing. There I found the venerable\r\nfather my lord Blamemenot Anitpleaseyou, the very worshipful Patriarch\r\nof Jerusalem, who, for reverence of the habit I have still worn of my\r\nlord Baron St. Anthony, would have me see all the holy relics that he\r\nhad about him and which were so many that, an I sought to recount\r\nthem all to you, I should not come to an end thereof in several miles.\r\nHowever, not to leave you disconsolate, I will tell you some thereof.\r\nFirst, he showed me the finger of the Holy Ghost, as whole and sound\r\nas ever it was, and the forelock of the seraph that appeared to St.\r\nFrancis and one of the nails of the Cherubim and one of the ribs of\r\nthe Verbum Caro[333] Get-thee-to-the-windows and some of the vestments\r\nof the Holy Catholic Faith and divers rays of the star that appeared\r\nto the Three Wise Men in the East and a vial of the sweat of St.\r\nMichael, whenas he fought with the devil, and the jawbone of the death\r\nof St. Lazarus and others. And for that I made him a free gift of the\r\nSteeps[334] of Monte Morello in the vernacular and of some chapters of\r\nthe Caprezio,[335] which he had long gone seeking, he made me a sharer\r\nin his holy relics and gave me one of the teeth of the Holy Rood and\r\nsomewhat of the sound of the bells of Solomon's Temple in a vial and\r\nthe feather of the Angel Gabriel, whereof I have already bespoken you,\r\nand one of the pattens of St. Gherardo da Villa Magna, which not long\r\nsince at Florence I gave to Gherardo di Bonsi, who hath a particular\r\ndevotion for that saint; and he gave me also of the coals wherewith\r\nthe most blessed martyr St. Lawrence was roasted; all which things I\r\ndevoutly brought home with me and yet have. True it is that my\r\nsuperior hath never suffered me to show them till such time as he\r\nshould be certified if they were the very things or not. But now that,\r\nby certain miracles performed by them and by letters received from the\r\npatriarch, he hath been made certain of this, he hath granted me leave\r\nto show them; and I, fearing to trust them to others, still carry them\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 333: _i.e._ The Word [made] flesh. Get-thee-to-the-windows\r\nis only a patter tag.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 334: Or Slopes or Coasts (_piaggie_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 335: ?]\r\n\r\nNow I carry the Angel Gabriel's feather, so it may not be marred, in\r\none casket, and the coals wherewith St. Lawrence was roasted in\r\nanother, the which are so like one to other, that it hath often\r\nhappened to me to take one for the other, and so hath it betided me at\r\nthis present, for that, thinking to bring hither the casket wherein\r\nwas the feather, I have brought that wherein are the coals. The which\r\nI hold not to have been an error; nay, meseemeth certain that it was\r\nGod's will and that He Himself placed the casket with the coals in my\r\nhands, especially now I mind me that the feast of St. Lawrence is but\r\ntwo days hence; wherefore God, willing that, by showing you the coals\r\nwherewith he was roasted, I should rekindle in your hearts the\r\ndevotion it behoveth you have for him, caused me take, not the\r\nfeather, as I purposed, but the blessed coals extinguished by the\r\nsweat of that most holy body. So, O my blessed children, put off your\r\nbonnets and draw near devoutly to behold them; but first I would have\r\nyou knew that whoso is scored with these coals, in the form of the\r\nsign of the cross, may rest assured, for the whole year to come, that\r\nfire shall not touch him but he shall feel it.'\r\n\r\nHaving thus spoken, he opened the casket, chanting the while a\r\ncanticle in praise of St. Lawrence, and showed the coals, which after\r\nthe simple multitude had awhile beheld with reverent admiration, they\r\nall crowded about Fra Cipolla and making him better offerings than\r\nthey were used, besought him to touch them withal. Accordingly, taking\r\nthe coals in hand, he fell to making the biggest crosses for which he\r\ncould find room upon their white smocks and doublets and upon the\r\nveils of the women, avouching that how much soever the coals\r\ndiminished in making these crosses, they after grew again in the\r\ncasket, as he had many a time proved. On this wise he crossed all the\r\npeople of Certaldo, to his no small profit, and thus, by his ready wit\r\nand presence of mind, he baffled those who, by taking the feather from\r\nhim, had thought to baffle him and who, being present at his\r\npreachment and hearing the rare shift employed by him and from how far\r\nhe had taken it and with what words, had so laughed that they thought\r\nto have cracked their jaws. Then, after the common folk had departed,\r\nthey went up to him and with all the mirth in the world discovered to\r\nhim that which they had done and after restored him his feather, which\r\nnext year stood him in as good stead as the coals had done that day.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis story afforded unto all the company alike the utmost pleasure and\r\nsolace, and it was much laughed of all at Fra Cipolla, and\r\nparticularly of his pilgrimage and the relics seen and brought back by\r\nhim. The queen, seeing the story and likewise her sovantry at an end,\r\nrose to her feet and put off the crown, which she set laughingly on\r\nDioneo's head, saying, \"It is time, Dioneo, that thou prove awhile\r\nwhat manner charge it is to have ladies to govern and guide; be thou,\r\nthen, king and rule on such wise that, in the end, we may have reason\r\nto give ourselves joy of thy governance.\" Dioneo took the crown and\r\nanswered, laughing, \"You may often enough have seen much better kings\r\nthan I, I mean chess-kings; but, an you obey me as a king should in\r\ntruth be obeyed, I will cause you enjoy that without which assuredly\r\nno entertainment is ever complete in its gladness. But let that talk\r\nbe; I will rule as best I know.\"\r\n\r\nThen, sending for the seneschal, according to the wonted usance, he\r\norderly enjoined him of that which he should do during the continuance\r\nof his seignory and after said, \"Noble ladies, it hath in divers\r\nmanners been devised of human industry[336] and of the various chances\r\n[of fortune,] insomuch that, had not Dame Licisca come hither a while\r\nagone and found me matter with her prate for our morrow's relations, I\r\nmisdoubt me I should have been long at pains to find a subject of\r\ndiscourse. As you heard, she avouched that she had not a single gossip\r\nwho had come to her husband a maid and added that she knew right well\r\nhow many and what manner tricks married women yet played their\r\nhusbands. But, letting be the first part, which is a childish matter,\r\nmethinketh the second should be an agreeable subject for discourse;\r\nwherefore I will and ordain it that, since Licisca hath given us\r\noccasion therefor, it be discoursed to-morrow OF THE TRICKS WHICH, OR\r\nFOR LOVE OR FOR THEIR OWN PRESERVATION, WOMEN HAVE HERETOFORE PLAYED\r\nTHEIR HUSBANDS, WITH OR WITHOUT THE LATTER'S COGNIZANCE THEREOF.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 336: _Industria_ in the old sense of ingenuity, skilful\r\nprocurement, etc.]\r\n\r\nIt seemed to some of the ladies that to discourse of such a matter\r\nwould ill beseem them and they prayed him, therefore, to change the\r\ntheme proposed; wherefore answered he, \"Ladies, I am no less cognizant\r\nthan yourselves of that which I have ordained, and that which you\r\nwould fain allege to me availed not to deter me from ordaining it,\r\nconsidering that the times are such that, provided men and women are\r\ncareful to eschew unseemly actions, all liberty of discourse is\r\npermitted. Know you not that, for the malignity of the season, the\r\njudges have forsaken the tribunals, that the laws, as well Divine as\r\nhuman, are silent and full licence is conceded unto every one for the\r\npreservation of his life? Wherefore, if your modesty allow itself some\r\nlittle freedom in discourse, not with intent to ensue it with aught of\r\nunseemly in deeds, but to afford yourselves and others diversion, I\r\nsee not with what plausible reason any can blame you in the future.\r\nMoreover, your company, from the first day of our assembling until\r\nthis present, hath been most decorous, nor, for aught that hath been\r\nsaid here, doth it appear to me that its honour hath anywise been\r\nsullied. Again, who is there knoweth not your virtue? Which, not to\r\nsay mirthful discourse, but even fear of death I do not believe could\r\navail to shake. And to tell you the truth, whosoever should hear that\r\nyou shrank from devising bytimes of these toys would be apt to suspect\r\nthat you were guilty in the matter and were therefore unwilling to\r\ndiscourse thereof. To say nothing of the fine honour you would do me\r\nin that, I having been obedient unto all, you now, having made me your\r\nking, seek to lay down the law to me, and not to discourse of the\r\nsubject which I propose. Put off, then, this misdoubtance, apter to\r\nmean minds than to yours, and good luck to you, let each of you\r\nbethink herself of some goodly story to tell.\" When the ladies heard\r\nthis, they said it should be as he pleased; whereupon he gave them all\r\nleave to do their several pleasures until supper-time.\r\n\r\nThe sun was yet high, for that the discoursement[337] had been brief;\r\nwherefor Dioneo having addressed himself to play at tables with the\r\nother young men, Elisa called the other ladies apart and said to them,\r\n\"Since we have been here, I have still wished to carry you to a place\r\nvery near at hand, whither methinketh none of you hath ever been and\r\nwhich is called the Ladies' Valley, but have never yet found an\r\noccasion of bringing you thither unto to-day; wherefore, as the sun is\r\nyet high, I doubt not but, an it please you come thither, you will be\r\nexceeding well pleased to have been there.\" They answered that they\r\nwere ready and calling one of their maids, set out upon their way,\r\nwithout letting the young men know aught thereof; nor had they gone\r\nmuch more than a mile, when they came to the Ladies' Valley. They\r\nentered therein by a very strait way, on one side whereof ran a very\r\nclear streamlet, and saw it as fair and as delectable, especially at\r\nthat season whenas the heat was great, as most might be conceived.\r\nAccording to that which one of them after told me, the plain that was\r\nin the valley was as round as if it had been traced with the compass,\r\nalbeit it seemed the work of nature and not of art, and was in circuit\r\na little more than half a mile, encompassed about with six little\r\nhills not over-high, on the summit of each of which stood a palace\r\nbuilded in guise of a goodly castle. The sides of these hills went\r\nsloping gradually downward to the plain on such wise as we see in\r\namphitheatres, the degrees descend in ordered succession from the\r\nhighest to the lowest, still contracting their circuit; and of these\r\nslopes those which looked toward the south were all full of vines and\r\nolives and almonds and cherries and figs and many another kind of\r\nfruit-bearing trees, without a span thereof being wasted; whilst those\r\nwhich faced the North Star[338] were all covered with thickets of\r\ndwarf oaks and ashes and other trees as green and straight as might\r\nbe. The middle plain, which had no other inlet than that whereby the\r\nladies were come thither, was full of firs and cypresses and laurels\r\nand various sorts of pines, as well arrayed and ordered as if the best\r\nartist in that kind had planted them; and between these little or no\r\nsun, even at its highest, made its way to the ground, which was all\r\none meadow of very fine grass, thick-sown with flowers purpurine and\r\nothers. Moreover, that which afforded no less delight than otherwhat\r\nwas a little stream, which ran down from a valley that divided two of\r\nthe hills aforesaid and falling over cliffs of live rock, made a\r\nmurmur very delectable to hear, what while it showed from afar, as it\r\nbroke over the stones, like so much quicksilver jetting out, under\r\npressure of somewhat, into fine spray. As it came down into the little\r\nplain, it was there received into a fair channel and ran very swiftly\r\ninto the middest thereof, where it formed a lakelet, such as the\r\ntownsfolk made whiles, by way of fishpond, in their gardens, whenas\r\nthey have a commodity thereof. This lakelet was no deeper than a man's\r\nstature, breast high, and its waters being exceeding clear and\r\naltogether untroubled with any admixture, it showed its bottom to be\r\nof a very fine gravel, the grains whereof whoso had nought else to do\r\nmight, an he would, have availed to number; nor, looking into the\r\nwater, was the bottom alone to be seen, nay, but so many fish fleeting\r\nhither and thither that, over and above the pleasure thereof, it was a\r\nmarvel to behold; nor was it enclosed with other banks than the very\r\nsoil of the meadow, which was the goodlier thereabout in so much as it\r\nreceived the more of its moisture. The water that abounded over and\r\nabove the capacity of the lake was received into another channel,\r\nwhereby, issuing forth of the little valley, it ran off into the lower\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 337: _i.e._ the tale-telling.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 338: Lit. the northern chariot (_carro di tramontana_);\r\n_quære_ the Great Bear?]\r\n\r\nHither then came the young ladies and after they had gazed all about\r\nand much commended the place, they took counsel together to bathe, for\r\nthat the heat was great and that they saw the lakelet before them and\r\nwere in no fear of being seen. Accordingly, bidding their serving\r\nmaid abide over against the way whereby one entered there and look if\r\nany should come and give them notice thereof, they stripped themselves\r\nnaked, all seven, and entered the lake, which hid their white bodies\r\nno otherwise than as a thin glass would do with a vermeil rose. Then,\r\nthey being therein and no troubling of the water ensuing thereof, they\r\nfell, as best they might, to faring hither and thither in pursuit of\r\nthe fish, which had uneath where to hide themselves, and seeking to\r\ntake them with the naked hand. After they had abidden awhile in such\r\njoyous pastime and had taken some of the fish, they came forth of the\r\nlakelet and clad themselves anew. Then, unable to commend the place\r\nmore than they had already done and themseeming time to turn homeward,\r\nthey set out, with soft step, upon their way, discoursing much of the\r\ngoodliness of the valley.\r\n\r\nThey reached the palace betimes and there found the young men yet at\r\nplay where they had left them; to whom quoth Pampinea, laughing. \"We\r\nhave e'en stolen a march on you to-day.\" \"How?\" asked Dioneo. \"Do you\r\nbegin to do deeds ere you come to say words?\"[339] \"Ay, my lord,\"\r\nanswered she and related to him at large whence they came and how the\r\nplace was fashioned and how far distant thence and that which they had\r\ndone. The king, hearing tell of the goodliness of the place and\r\ndesirous of seeing it, caused straightway order the supper, which\r\nbeing dispatched to the general satisfaction, the three young men,\r\nleaving the ladies, betook themselves with their servants to the\r\nvalley and having viewed it in every part, for that none of them had\r\never been there before, extolled it for one of the goodliest things in\r\nthe world. Then, for that it grew late, after they had bathed and\r\ndonned their clothes, they returned home, where they found the ladies\r\ndancing a round, to the accompaniment of a song sung by Fiammetta.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 339: Alluding to the subject fixed for the next day's\r\ndiscourse, as who should say, \"Have you begun already to play tricks\r\nupon us men in very deed, ere you tell about them in words?\"]\r\n\r\nThe dance ended, they entered with them into a discourse of the\r\nLadies' Valley and said much in praise and commendation thereof.\r\nMoreover, the king, sending for the seneschal, bade him look that the\r\ndinner be made ready there on the following morning and have sundry\r\nbeds carried thither, in case any should have a mind to lie or sleep\r\nthere for nooning; after which he let bring lights and wine and\r\nconfections and the company having somedele refreshed themselves, he\r\ncommanded that all should address themselves to dancing. Then, Pamfilo\r\nhaving, at his commandment, set up a dance, the king turned to Elisa\r\nand said courteously to her, \"Fair damsel, thou has to-day done me the\r\nhonour of the crown and I purpose this evening to do thee that of the\r\nsong; wherefore look thou sing such an one as most liketh thee.\" Elisa\r\nanswered, smiling, that she would well and with dulcet voice began on\r\nthis wise:\r\n\r\n       Love, from thy clutches could I but win free,\r\n         Hardly, methinks, again\r\n       Shall any other hook take hold on me.\r\n       I entered in thy wars a youngling maid,\r\n         Thinking thy strife was utmost peace and sweet,\r\n       And all my weapons on the ground I laid,\r\n         As one secure, undoubting of defeat;\r\n         But thou, false tyrant, with rapacious heat,\r\n       Didst fall on me amain\r\n     With all the grapnels of thine armoury.\r\n\r\n       Then, wound about and fettered with thy chains,\r\n         To him, who for my death in evil hour\r\n       Was born, thou gav'st me, bounden, full of pains\r\n         And bitter tears; and syne within his power\r\n         He hath me and his rule's so harsh and dour\r\n       No sighs can move the swain\r\n     Nor all my wasting plaints to set me free.\r\n\r\n       My prayers, the wild winds bear them all away;\r\n         He hearkeneth unto none and none will hear;\r\n       Wherefore each hour my torment waxeth aye;\r\n         I cannot die, albeit life irks me drear.\r\n         Ah, Lord, have pity on my heavy cheer;\r\n       Do that I seek in vain\r\n     And give him bounden in thy chains to me.\r\n\r\n       An this thou wilt not, at the least undo\r\n         The bonds erewhen of hope that knitted were;\r\n       Alack, O Lord, thereof to thee I sue,\r\n         For, an thou do it, yet to waxen fair\r\n         Again I trust, as was my use whilere,\r\n       And being quit of pain\r\n     Myself with white flowers and with red besee.\r\n\r\nElisa ended her song with a very plaintive sigh, and albeit all\r\nmarvelled at the words thereof, yet was there none who might conceive\r\nwhat it was that caused her sing thus. But the king, who was in a\r\nmerry mood, calling for Tindaro, bade him bring out his bagpipes, to\r\nthe sound whereof he let dance many dances; after which, a great part\r\nof the night being now past, he bade each go sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE ENDETH THE SIXTH DAY\r\nOF THE DECAMERON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Day the Seventh_\r\n\r\n     HERE BEGINNETH THE SEVENTH DAY OF THE DECAMERON WHEREIN\r\n     UNDER THE GOVERNANCE OF DIONEO IS DISCOURSED OF THE TRICKS\r\n     WHICH OR FOR LOVE OR FOR THEIR OWN PRESERVATION WOMEN HAVE\r\n     HERETOFORE PLAYED THEIR HUSBANDS WITH OR WITHOUT THE\r\n     LATTER'S COGNIZANCE THEREOF\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery star was already fled from the parts of the East, save only that\r\nwhich we style Lucifer and which shone yet in the whitening dawn, when\r\nthe seneschal, arising, betook himself, with a great baggage-train, to\r\nthe Ladies' Valley, there to order everything, according to\r\ncommandment had of his lord. The king, whom the noise of the packers\r\nand of the beasts had awakened, tarried not long after his departure\r\nto rise and being risen, caused arouse all the ladies and likewise the\r\nyoung men; nor had the rays of the sun yet well broken forth, when\r\nthey all entered upon the road. Never yet had the nightingales and the\r\nother birds seemed to them to sing so blithely as they did that\r\nmorning, what while, accompanied by their carols, they repaired to the\r\nLadies' Valley, where they were received by many more, which seemed to\r\nthem to make merry for their coming. There, going round about the\r\nplace and reviewing it all anew, it appeared to them so much fairer\r\nthan on the foregoing day as the season of the day was more sorted to\r\nits goodliness. Then, after they had broken their fast with good wine\r\nand confections, not to be behindhand with the birds in the matter of\r\nsong, they fell a-singing and the valley with them, still echoing\r\nthose same songs which they did sing, whereto all the birds, as if\r\nthey would not be outdone, added new and dulcet notes. Presently, the\r\ndinner-hour being come and the tables spread hard by the fair lakelet\r\nunder the thickset laurels and other goodly trees, they seated\r\nthemselves there, as it pleased the king, and eating, watched the fish\r\nswim in vast shoals about the lake, which gave bytimes occasion for\r\ntalk as well as observation. When they had made an end of dining and\r\nthe meats and tables were removed, they fell anew to singing more\r\nblithely than ever; after which, beds having been spread in various\r\nplaces about the little valley and all enclosed about by the discreet\r\nseneschal with curtains and canopies of French serge, whoso would\r\nmight with the king's permission, go sleep; whilst those who had no\r\nmind to sleep might at their will take pleasure of their other wonted\r\npastimes. But, after awhile, all being now arisen and the hour come\r\nwhen they should assemble together for story-telling, carpets were, at\r\nthe king's commandment, spread upon the grass, not far from the place\r\nwhere they had eaten, and all having seated themselves thereon hard by\r\nthe lake, the king bade Emilia begin; whereupon she blithely proceeded\r\nto speak, smiling, thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Seventh]\r\n\r\n     GIANNI LOTTERINGHI HEARETH KNOCK AT HIS DOOR BY NIGHT AND\r\n     AWAKENETH HIS WIFE, WHO GIVETH HIM TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS A\r\n     PHANTOM; WHEREUPON THEY GO TO EXORCISE IT WITH A CERTAIN\r\n     ORISON AND THE KNOCKING CEASETH\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My Lord, it had been very agreeable to me, were such your pleasure,\r\nthat other than I should have given a beginning to so goodly a matter\r\nas is that whereof we are to speak; but, since it pleaseth you that I\r\ngive all the other ladies assurance by my example, I will gladly do\r\nit. Moreover, dearest ladies, I will study to tell a thing that may be\r\nuseful to you in time to come, for that, if you others are as fearful\r\nas I, and especially of phantoms, (though what manner of thing they\r\nmay be God knoweth I know not, nor ever found I any woman who knew it,\r\nalbeit all are alike adread of them,) you may, by noting well my\r\nstory, learn a holy and goodly orison of great virtue for the\r\nconjuring them away, should they come to you.\r\n\r\nThere was once in Florence, in the quarter of San Brancazio, a\r\nwool-comber called Gianni Lotteringhi, a man more fortunate in his\r\ncraft than wise in other things, for that, savoring of the simpleton,\r\nhe was very often made captain of the Laudsingers[340] of Santa Maria\r\nNovella and had the governance of their confraternity, and he many a\r\ntime had other little offices of the same kind, upon which he much\r\nvalued himself. This betided him for that, being a man of substance,\r\nhe gave many a good pittance to the clergy, who, getting of him often,\r\nthis a pair of hose, that a gown and another a scapulary, taught him\r\nin return store of goodly orisons and gave him the paternoster in the\r\nvulgar tongue, the Song of Saint Alexis, the Lamentations of Saint\r\nBernard, the Canticles of Madam Matilda and the like trumpery, all\r\nwhich he held very dear and kept very diligently for his soul's\r\nhealth. Now he had a very fair and lovesome lady to wife, by name\r\nMistress Tessa, who was the daughter of Mannuccio dalla Cuculia and\r\nwas exceeding discreet and well advised. She, knowing her husband's\r\nsimplicity and being enamoured of Federigo di Neri Pegolotti, a brisk\r\nand handsome youth, and he of her, took order with a serving-maid of\r\nhers that he should come speak with her at a very goodly country house\r\nwhich her husband had at Camerata, where she sojourned all the summer\r\nand whither Gianni came whiles to sup and sleep, returning in the\r\nmorning to his shop and bytimes to his Laudsingers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 340: See p. 144, note 2.]\r\n\r\nFederigo, who desired this beyond measure, taking his opportunity,\r\nrepaired thither on the day appointed him towards vespers and Gianni\r\nnot coming thither that evening, supped and lay the night in all ease\r\nand delight with the lady, who, being in his arms, taught him that\r\nnight a good half dozen of her husband's lauds. Then, neither she nor\r\nFederigo purposing that this should be the last, as it had been the\r\nfirst time [of their foregathering], they took order together on this\r\nwise, so it should not be needful to send the maid for him each time,\r\nto wit, that every day, as he came and went to and from a place he had\r\na little farther on, he should keep his eye on a vineyard that\r\nadjoined the house, where he would see an ass's skull set up on one of\r\nthe vine poles, which whenas he saw with the muzzle turned towards\r\nFlorence, he should without fail and in all assurance betake himself\r\nto her that evening after dark; and if he found the door shut he\r\nshould knock softly thrice and she would open to him; but that, whenas\r\nhe saw the ass's muzzle turned towards Fiesole, he should not come,\r\nfor that Gianni would be there; and doing on this wise, they\r\nforegathered many a time.\r\n\r\nBut once, amongst other times, it chanced that, Federigo being one\r\nnight to sup with Mistress Tessa and she having let cook two fat\r\ncapons, Gianni, who was not expected there that night, came thither\r\nvery late, whereat the lady was much chagrined and having supped with\r\nher husband on a piece of salt pork, which she had let boil apart,\r\ncaused the maid wrap the two boiled capons in a white napkin and carry\r\nthem, together with good store of new-laid eggs and a flask of good\r\nwine, into a garden she had, whither she could go, without passing\r\nthrough the house, and where she was wont to sup whiles with her\r\nlover, bidding her lay them at the foot of a peach-tree that grew\r\nbeside a lawn there. But such was her trouble and annoy that she\r\nremembered not to bid the maid wait till Federigo should come and tell\r\nhim that Gianni was there and that he should take the viands from the\r\ngarden; wherefore, she and Gianni betaking themselves to bed and the\r\nmaid likewise, it was not long before Federigo came to the door and\r\nknocked softly once. The door was so near to the bedchamber that\r\nGianni heard it incontinent, as also did the lady; but she made a show\r\nof being asleep, so her husband might have no suspicion of her. After\r\nwaiting a little, Federigo knocked a second time, whereupon Gianni,\r\nmarvelling, nudged his wife somewhat and said, 'Tessa, hearest thou\r\nwhat I hear? Meseemeth there is a knocking at our door.'\r\n\r\nThe lady, who had heard it much better than he, made a show of awaking\r\nand said, 'Eh? How sayst thou?' 'I say,' answered Gianni, 'that\r\nmeseemeth there is a knocking at our door.' 'Knocking!' cried she.\r\n'Alack, Gianni mine, knowst thou not what it is? It is a phantom, that\r\nhath these last few nights given me the greatest fright that ever was,\r\ninsomuch that, whenas I hear it, I put my head under the clothes and\r\ndare not bring it out again until it is broad day.' Quoth Gianni, 'Go\r\nto, wife; have no fear, if it be so; for I said the _Te Lucis_ and the\r\n_Intemerata_ and such and such other pious orisons, before we lay\r\ndown, and crossed the bed from side to side, in the name of the\r\nFather, the Son and the Holy Ghost, so that we have no need to fear,\r\nfor that, what power soever it have, it cannot avail to harm us.'\r\n\r\nThe lady, fearing lest Federigo should perchance suspect otherwhat and\r\nbe angered with her, determined at all hazards to arise and let him\r\nknow that Gianni was there; wherefore quoth she to her husband, 'That\r\nis all very well; thou sayst thy words, thou; but, for my part, I\r\nshall never hold myself safe nor secure, except we exorcise it, since\r\nthou art here.' 'And how is it to be exorcised?' asked he; and she, 'I\r\nknow full well how to exorcise it; for, the other day, when I went to\r\nthe Pardon at Fiesole, a certain anchoress (the very holiest of\r\ncreatures, Gianni mine, God only can say how holy she is,) seeing me\r\nthus fearful, taught me a pious and effectual orison and told me that\r\nshe had made trial of it several times, ere she became a recluse, and\r\nthat it had always availed her. God knoweth I should never have dared\r\ngo alone to make proof of it; but, now that thou art here, I would\r\nhave us go exorcise the phantom.'\r\n\r\nGianni answered that he would well and accordingly they both arose and\r\nwent softly to the door, without which Federigo, who now began to\r\nmisdoubt him of somewhat, was yet in waiting. When they came thither,\r\nthe lady said to Gianni, 'Do thou spit, whenas I shall bid thee.' And\r\nhe answered, 'Good.' Then she began the conjuration and said,\r\n'Phantom, phantom that goest by night, with tail upright[341] thou\r\ncam'st to us; now get thee gone with tail upright. Begone into the\r\ngarden to the foot of the great peach tree; there shalt thou find an\r\nanointed twice-anointed one[342] and an hundred turds of my sitting\r\nhen;[343] set thy mouth to the flagon and get thee gone again and do\r\nthou no hurt to my Gianni nor to me.' Then to her husband, 'Spit,\r\nGianni,' quoth she, and he spat. Federigo, who heard all this from\r\nwithout and was now quit of jealousy, had, for all his vexation, so\r\ngreat a mind to laugh that he was like to burst, and when Gianni spat,\r\nhe said under his breath '[Would it were] thy teeth!'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 341: _i.e._ pene arrecto.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 342: _i.e._ a fattened capon well larded.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 343: _i.e._ eggs.]\r\n\r\nThe lady, having thrice conjured the phantom on this wise, returned to\r\nbed with her husband, whilst Federigo, who had not supped, looking to\r\nsup with her, and had right well apprehended the words of the\r\nconjuration, betook himself to the garden and finding the capons and\r\nwine and eggs at the foot of the great peach-tree, carried them off to\r\nhis house and there supped at his ease; and after, when he next\r\nforegathered with the lady, he had a hearty laugh with her anent the\r\nconjuration aforesaid. Some say indeed that the lady had actually\r\nturned the ass's skull towards Fiesole, but that a husbandman, passing\r\nthrough the vineyard, had given it a blow with a stick and caused it\r\nspin round and it had become turned towards Florence, wherefore\r\nFederigo, thinking himself summoned, had come thither, and that the\r\nlady had made the conjuration on this wise: 'Phantom, phantom, get\r\nthee gone in God's name; for it was not I turned the ass's head; but\r\nanother it was, God put him to shame! and I am here with my Gianni in\r\nbed'; whereupon he went away and abode without supper or lodging. But\r\na neighbour of mine, a very ancient lady, telleth me that, according\r\nto that which she heard, when a child, both the one and the other were\r\ntrue; but that the latter happened, not to Gianni Lotteringhi, but to\r\none Gianni di Nello, who abode at Porta San Piero and was no less\r\nexquisite a ninny than the other. Wherefore, dear my ladies, it\r\nabideth at your election to take whether of the two orisons most\r\npleaseth you, except you will have both. They have great virtue in\r\nsuch cases, as you have had proof in the story you have heard; get\r\nthem, therefore, by heart and they may yet avail you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Seventh]\r\n\r\n     PERONELLA HIDETH A LOVER OF HERS IN A VAT, UPON HER\r\n     HUSBAND'S UNLOOKED FOR RETURN, AND HEARING FROM THE LATTER\r\n     THAT HE HATH SOLD THE VAT, AVOUCHETH HERSELF TO HAVE SOLD IT\r\n     TO ONE WHO IS PRESENTLY THEREWITHIN, TO SEE IF IT BE SOUND;\r\n     WHEREUPON THE GALLANT, JUMPING OUT OF THE VAT, CAUSETH THE\r\n     HUSBAND SCRAPE IT OUT FOR HIM AND AFTER CARRY IT HOME TO HIS\r\n     HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nEmilia's story was received with loud laughter and the conjuration\r\ncommended of all as goodly and excellent; and this come to an end, the\r\nking bade Filostrato follow on, who accordingly began, \"Dearest\r\nladies, so many are the tricks that men, and particularly husbands,\r\nplay you, that, if some woman chance whiles to put a cheat upon her\r\nhusband, you should not only be blithe that this hath happened and\r\ntake pleasure in coming to know it or hearing it told of any, but\r\nshould yourselves go telling it everywhere, so men may understand\r\nthat, if they are knowing, women, on their part, are no less so! the\r\nwhich cannot be other than useful unto you, for that, when one knoweth\r\nthat another is on the alert, he setteth himself not overlightly to\r\ncozen him. Who, then, can doubt but that which we shall say to-day\r\nconcerning this matter, coming to be known of men, may be exceeding\r\neffectual in restraining them from cozening you ladies, whenas they\r\nfind that you likewise know how to cozen, an you will? I purpose,\r\ntherefore, to tell you the trick which, on the spur of the moment, a\r\nyoung woman, albeit she was of mean condition, played her husband for\r\nher own preservation.\r\n\r\nIn Naples no great while agone there was a poor man who took to wife a\r\nfair and lovesome damsel called Peronella, and albeit he with his\r\ncraft, which was that of a mason, and she by spinning, earned but a\r\nslender pittance, they ordered their life as best they might. It\r\nchanced one day that a young gallant of the neighbourhood saw this\r\nPeronella and she pleasing him mightily, he fell in love with her and\r\nimportuned her one way and another till he became familiar with her\r\nand they took order with each other on this wise, so they might be\r\ntogether; to wit, seeing that her husband arose every morning betimes\r\nto go to work or to find work, they agreed that the young man should\r\nbe whereas he might see him go out, and that, as soon as he was\r\ngone,--the street where she abode, which was called Avorio, being very\r\nsolitary,--he should come to her house. On this wise they did many\r\ntimes; but one morning, the good man having gone out and Giannello\r\nStrignario (for so was the lover named) having entered the house and\r\nbeing with Peronella, it chanced that, after awhile, the husband\r\nreturned home, whereas it was his wont to be abroad all day, and\r\nfinding the door locked within, knocked and after fell a-saying in\r\nhimself, 'O my God, praised be Thou ever! For, though Thou hast made\r\nme poor, at least Thou hast comforted me with a good and honest damsel\r\nto wife. See how she locked the door within as soon as I was gone out,\r\nso none might enter to do her any annoy.'\r\n\r\nPeronella, knowing her husband by his way of knocking, said to her\r\nlover, 'Alack, Giannello mine, I am a dead woman! For here is my\r\nhusband, whom God confound, come back and I know not what this\r\nmeaneth, for never yet came he back hither at this hour; belike he saw\r\nthee whenas thou enteredst here. But, for the love of God, however the\r\ncase may be, get thee into yonder vat, whilst I go open to him, and we\r\nshall see what is the meaning of his returning home so early this\r\nmorning.' Accordingly, Giannello betook himself in all haste into the\r\nvat, whilst Peronella, going to the door, opened to her husband and\r\nsaid to him, with an angry air, 'What is to do now, that thou\r\nreturnest home so soon this morning? Meseemeth thou hast a mind to do\r\nnought to-day, that I see thee come back, tools in hand; and if thou\r\ndo thus, on what are we to live? Whence shall we get bread? Thinkest\r\nthou I will suffer thee pawn my gown and my other poor clothes? I, who\r\ndo nothing but spin day and night, till the flesh is come apart from\r\nmy nails, so I may at the least have so much oil as will keep our lamp\r\nburning! Husband, husband, there is not a neighbour's wife of ours but\r\nmarvelleth thereat and maketh mock of me for the pains I give myself\r\nand all that I endure; and thou, thou returnest home to me, with thy\r\nhands a-dangle, whenas thou shouldst be at work.'\r\n\r\nSo saying, she fell a-weeping and went on to say, 'Alack, woe is me,\r\nunhappy woman that I am! In what an ill hour was I born, at what an\r\nill moment did I come hither! I who might have had a young man of such\r\nworth and would none of him, so I might come to this fellow here, who\r\ntaketh no thought to her whom he hath brought home! Other women give\r\nthemselves a good time with their lovers, for there is none [I know]\r\nbut hath two and some three, and they enjoy themselves and show their\r\nhusbands the moon for the sun. But I, wretch that I am! because I am\r\ngood and occupy myself not with such toys, I suffer ill and ill hap. I\r\nknow not why I do not take me a lover, as do other women. Understand\r\nwell, husband mine, that had I a mind to do ill, I could soon enough\r\nfind the wherewithal, for there be store of brisk young fellows who\r\nlove me and wish me well and have sent to me, proffering money galore\r\nor dresses and jewels, at my choice; but my heart would never suffer\r\nme to do it, for that I was no mother's daughter of that ilk; and here\r\nthou comest home to me, whenas thou shouldst be at work.'\r\n\r\n'Good lack, wife,' answered the husband, 'fret not thyself, for God's\r\nsake; thou shouldst be assured that I know what manner of woman thou\r\nart, and indeed this morning I have in part had proof thereof. It is\r\ntrue that I went out to go to work; but it seemeth thou knowest not,\r\nas I myself knew not, that this is the Feast-day of San Galeone and\r\nthere is no work doing; that is why I am come back at this hour; but\r\nnone the less I have provided and found a means how we shall have\r\nbread for more than a month, for I have sold yonder man thou seest\r\nhere with me the vat which, as thou knowest, hath this long while\r\ncumbered the house; and he is to give me five lily-florins[344] for\r\nit.' Quoth Peronella, 'So much the more cause have I to complain;\r\nthou, who art a man and goest about and should be versed in the things\r\nof the world, thou hast sold a vat for five florins, whilst I, a poor\r\nsilly woman who hath scarce ever been without the door, seeing the\r\nhindrance it gave us in the house, have sold it for seven to an honest\r\nman, who entered it but now, as thou camest back, to see if it were\r\nsound!' When the husband heard this, he was more than satisfied and\r\nsaid to him who had come for the vat, 'Good man, begone in peace; for\r\nthou hearest that my wife hath sold the vat for seven florins, whereas\r\nthou wast to give me but five for it.' 'Good,' replied the other and\r\nwent his way; whereupon quoth Peronella to her husband, 'Since thou\r\nart here, come up and settle with him thyself.' Giannello, who abode\r\nwith his ears pricked up to hear if it behoved him fear or be on his\r\nguard against aught, hearing his mistress's words, straightway\r\nscrambled out of the vat and cried out, as if he had heard nothing of\r\nthe husband's return, 'Where art thou, good wife?' whereupon the\r\ngoodman, coming up, answered, 'Here am I; what wouldst thou have?'\r\n'Who art thou?' asked Giannello. 'I want the woman with whom I made\r\nthe bargain for this vat.' Quoth the other, 'You may deal with me in\r\nall assurance, for I am her husband.' Then said Giannello, 'The vat\r\nappeareth to me sound enough; but meseemeth you have kept dregs or the\r\nlike therein, for it is all overcrusted with I know not what that is\r\nso hard and dry that I cannot remove aught thereof with my nails;\r\nwherefore I will not take it, except I first see it clean.' 'Nay,'\r\nanswered Peronella, 'the bargain shall not fall through for that; my\r\nhusband will clean it all out.' 'Ay will I,' rejoined the latter, and\r\nlaying down his tools, put off his coat; then, calling for a light and\r\na scraper, he entered the vat and fell to scraping. Peronella, as if\r\nshe had a mind to see what he did, thrust her head and one of her\r\narms, shoulder and all, in at the mouth of the vat, which was not\r\noverbig, and fell to saying, 'Scrape here' and 'There' and 'There\r\nalso' and 'See, here is a little left.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 344: So called from the figure of a lily stamped on the\r\ncoin; cf. our rose-nobles.]\r\n\r\nWhilst she was thus engaged in directing her husband and showing him\r\nwhere to scrape, Giannello, who had scarce yet that morning done his\r\nfull desire, when they were interrupted by the mason's coming, seeing\r\nthat he could not as he would, bethought himself to accomplish it as\r\nhe might; wherefore, boarding her, as she held the mouth of the vat\r\nall closed up, on such wise as in the ample plains the unbridled\r\nstallions, afire with love, assail the mares of Parthia, he satisfied\r\nhis juvenile ardour, the which enterprise was brought to perfection\r\nwell nigh at the same moment as the scraping of the vat; whereupon he\r\ndismounted and Peronella withdrawing her head from the mouth of the\r\nvat, the husband came forth thereof. Then said she to her gallant,\r\n'Take this light, good man, and look if it be clean to thy mind.'\r\nGiannello looked in and said that it was well and that he was\r\nsatisfied and giving the husband seven florins, caused carry the vat\r\nto his own house.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Seventh]\r\n\r\n     FRA RINALDO LIETH WITH HIS GOSSIP AND BEING FOUND OF HER\r\n     HUSBAND CLOSETED WITH HER IN HER CHAMBER, THEY GIVE HIM TO\r\n     BELIEVE THAT HE WAS IN ACT TO CONJURE WORMS FROM HIS GODSON\r\n\r\n\r\nFilostrato had not known to speak so obscurely of the mares of Parthia\r\nbut that the roguish ladies laughed thereat, making believe to laugh\r\nat otherwhat. But, when the king saw that his story was ended, he bade\r\nElisa tell, who accordingly, with obedient readiness, began, \"Charming\r\nladies, Emilia's conjuration of the phantom hath brought to my memory\r\nthe story of another conjuration, which latter, though it be not so\r\ngoodly as hers, nevertheless, for that none other bearing upon our\r\nsubject occurreth to me at this present, I will proceed to relate.\r\n\r\nYou must know that there was once in Siena a very agreeable young man\r\nand of a worshipful family, by name Rinaldo, who was passionately\r\nenamored of a very beautiful lady, a neighbour of his and the wife of\r\na rich man, and flattered himself that, could he but find means to\r\nspeak with her unsuspected, he might avail to have of her all that he\r\nshould desire. Seeing none other way and the lady being great with\r\nchild, he bethought himself to become her gossip and accordingly,\r\nclapping up an acquaintance with her husband, he offered him, on such\r\nwise as appeared to him most seemly, to be godfather to his child. His\r\noffer was accepted and he being now become Madam Agnesa's gossip and\r\nhaving a somewhat more colourable excuse for speaking with her, he\r\ntook courage and gave her in so many words to know that of his intent\r\nwhich she had indeed long before gathered from his looks; but little\r\ndid this profit him, although the lady was nothing displeased to have\r\nheard him.\r\n\r\nNot long after, whatever might have been the reason, it came to pass\r\nthat Rinaldo turned friar and whether or not he found the pasturage to\r\nhis liking, he persevered in that way of life; and albeit, in the days\r\nof his becoming a monk, he had for awhile laid on one side the love he\r\nbore his gossip, together with sundry other vanities of his, yet, in\r\nprocess of time, without quitting the monk's habit, he resumed\r\nthem[345] and began to delight in making a show and wearing fine\r\nstuffs and being dainty and elegant in all his fashions and making\r\ncanzonets and sonnets and ballads and in singing and all manner other\r\nthings of the like sort. But what say I of our Fra Rinaldo, of whom we\r\nspeak? What monks are there that do not thus? Alack, shame that they\r\nare of the corrupt world, they blush not to appear fat and ruddy in\r\nthe face, dainty in their garb and in all that pertaineth unto them,\r\nand strut along, not like doves, but like very turkey-cocks, with\r\ncrest erect and breast puffed out; and what is worse (to say nothing\r\nof having their cells full of gallipots crammed with electuaries and\r\nunguents, of boxes full of various confections, of phials and flagons\r\nof distilled waters and oils, of pitchers brimming with Malmsey and\r\nCyprus and other wines of price, insomuch that they seem to the\r\nbeholder not friars' cells, but rather apothecaries' or perfumers'\r\nshops) they think no shame that folk should know them to be gouty,\r\nconceiving that others see not nor know that strict fasting, coarse\r\nviands and spare and sober living make men lean and slender and for\r\nthe most part sound of body, and that if indeed some sicken thereof,\r\nat least they sicken not of the gout, whereto it is used to give, for\r\nmedicine, chastity and everything else that pertaineth to the natural\r\nway of living of an honest friar. Yet they persuade themselves that\r\nothers know not that,--let alone the scant and sober living,--long\r\nvigils, praying and discipline should make men pale and mortified and\r\nthat neither St. Dominic nor St. Francis, far from having four gowns\r\nfor one, clad themselves in cloth dyed in grain nor in other fine\r\nstuffs, but in garments of coarse wool and undyed, to keep out the\r\ncold and not to make a show. For which things, as well as for the\r\nsouls of the simpletons who nourish them, there is need that God\r\nprovide.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 345: _i.e._ the discarded vanities aforesaid.]\r\n\r\nFra Rinaldo, then, having returned to his former appetites, began to\r\npay frequent visits to his gossip and waxing in assurance, proceeded\r\nto solicit her with more than his former instancy to that which he\r\ndesired of her. The good lady, seeing herself hard pressed and Fra\r\nRinaldo seeming to her belike goodlier than she had thought him\r\naforetime, being one day sore importuned of him, had recourse to that\r\nargument which all women use who have a mind to yield that which is\r\nasked of them and said, 'How now, Fra Rinaldo? Do monks such things?'\r\n'Madam,' answered he, 'when as I shall have this gown off my\r\nback,--and I can put it off mighty easily,--I shall appear to you a\r\nman fashioned like other men and not a monk.' The lady pulled a demure\r\nface and said, 'Alack, wretched me! You are my gossip; how can I do\r\nthis? It were sadly ill, and I have heard many a time that it is a\r\nvery great sin; but, certes, were it not for this, I would do that\r\nwhich you wish.' Quoth Fra Rinaldo, 'You are a simpleton, if you\r\nforbear for this; I do not say that it is not a sin, but God pardoneth\r\ngreater than this to whoso repenteth. But tell me, who is more akin to\r\nyour child, I who held him at baptism or your husband who begat him?'\r\n'My husband is more akin to him,' answered the lady; whereupon, 'You\r\nsay sooth,' rejoined the friar. 'And doth not your husband lie with\r\nyou?' 'Ay doth he,' replied she. 'Then,' said Fra Rinaldo, 'I, who am\r\nless akin to your child than is your husband, may lie with you even\r\nas doth he.' The lady, who knew no logic and needed little persuasion,\r\neither believed or made a show of believing that the friar spoke the\r\ntruth and answered, 'Who might avail to answer your learned words?'\r\nAnd after, notwithstanding the gossipship, she resigned herself to do\r\nhis pleasure; nor did they content themselves with one bout, but\r\nforegathered many and many a time, having the more commodity thereof\r\nunder cover of the gossipship, for that there was less suspicion.\r\n\r\nBut once, amongst other times, it befell that Fra Rinaldo, coming to\r\nthe lady's house and finding none with her but a little maid of hers,\r\nwho was very pretty and agreeable, despatched his comrade with the\r\nlatter to the pigeon-loft, to teach her her Paternoster, and entered\r\nwith the lady, who had her child in her hand, into her bedchamber,\r\nwhere they locked themselves in and fell to taking their pleasure upon\r\na daybed that was there. As they were thus engaged, it chanced that\r\nthe husband came home and making for the bedchamber-door, unperceived\r\nof any, knocked and called to the lady, who, hearing this, said to the\r\nfriar, 'I am a dead woman, for here is my husband, and now he will\r\ncertainly perceive what is the reason of our familiarity.' Now Rinaldo\r\nwas stripped to his waistcoat, to wit, he had put off his gown and his\r\nscapulary, and hearing this, answered, 'You say sooth; were I but\r\ndressed, there might be some means; but, if you open to him and he\r\nfind me thus, there can be no excuse for us.' The lady, seized with a\r\nsudden idea, said, 'Harkye, dress yourself and when you are dressed,\r\ntake your godchild in your arms and hearken well to that which I shall\r\nsay to him, so your words may after accord with mine, and leave me\r\ndo.' Then, to the good man, who had not yet left knocking, 'I come to\r\nthee,' quoth she and rising, opened the chamber-door and said, with a\r\ngood countenance, 'Husband mine, I must tell thee that Fra Rinaldo,\r\nour gossip, is come hither and it was God sent him to us; for, certes,\r\nbut for his coming, we should to-day have lost our child.'\r\n\r\nThe good simple man, hearing this, was like to swoon and said, 'How\r\nso?' 'O husband mine,' answered Agnesa, 'there took him but now of a\r\nsudden a fainting-fit, that methought he was dead, and I knew not what\r\nto do or say; but just then Fra Rinaldo our gossip came in and taking\r\nhim in his arms, said, \"Gossip, these be worms he hath in his body,\r\nthe which draw near to his heart and would infallibly kill him; but\r\nhave no fear, for I will conjure them and make them all die; and ere I\r\ngo hence, you shall see the child whole again as ever you saw him.\"\r\nAnd for that we had need of thee to repeat certain orisons and that\r\nthe maid could not find thee, he caused his comrade say them in the\r\nhighest room of our house, whilst he and I came hither and locked\r\nourselves in, so none should hinder us, for that none other than the\r\nchild's mother might be present at such an office. Indeed, he hath the\r\nchild yet in his arms and methinketh he waiteth but for his comrade to\r\nhave made an end of saying the orisons and it will be done, for that\r\nthe boy is already altogether restored to himself.' The good simple\r\nman, believing all this, was so straitened with concern for his child\r\nthat it never entered his mind to suspect the cheat put upon him by\r\nhis wife; but, heaving a great sigh, he said, 'I will go see him.'\r\n'Nay,' answered she, 'thou wouldst mar that which hath been done.\r\nWait; I will go see an thou mayst come in and call thee.'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Fra Rinaldo, who had heard everything and had dressed\r\nhimself at his leisure, took the child in his arms and called out, as\r\nsoon as he had ordered matters to his mind, saying, 'Harkye, gossip,\r\nhear I not my gossip your husband there?' 'Ay, sir,' answered the\r\nsimpleton; whereupon, 'Then,' said the other, 'come hither.' The\r\ncuckold went to him and Fra Rinaldo said to him, 'Take your son by the\r\ngrace of God whole and well, whereas I deemed but now you would not\r\nsee him alive at vespers; and look you let make a waxen image of his\r\nbigness and set it up, to the praise and glory of God, before the\r\nstatue of our lord St. Ambrose, through whose intercession He hath\r\nvouchsafed to restore him unto you.' The child, seeing his father, ran\r\nto him and caressed him, as little children used to do, whilst the\r\nlatter, taking him, weeping, in his arms, no otherwise than as he had\r\nbrought him forth of the grave, fell to kissing him and returning\r\nthanks to his gossip for that he had made him whole.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Fra Rinaldo's comrade, who had by this taught the\r\nserving-wench not one, but maybe more than four paternosters, and had\r\ngiven her a little purse of white thread, which he had from a nun, and\r\nmade her his devotee, hearing the cuckold call at his wife's\r\nchamber-door, had softly betaken himself to a place whence he could,\r\nhimself unseen, both see and hear what should betide and presently,\r\nseeing that all had passed off well, came down and entering the\r\nchamber, said, 'Fra Rinaldo, I have despatched all four of the orisons\r\nwhich you bade me say.' 'Brother mine,' answered the friar, 'thou hast\r\na good wind and hast done well; I, for my part, had said but two\r\nthereof, when my gossip came; but God the Lord, what with thy pains\r\nand mine, hath shown us such favour that the child is healed.'\r\nTherewithal the cuckold let bring good wines and confections and\r\nentertained his gossip and the latter's comrade with that whereof they\r\nhad more need than of aught else. Then, attending them to the door, he\r\ncommended them to God and letting make the waxen image without delay,\r\nhe sent to hang it up with the others[346] before the statue of St.\r\nAmbrose, but not that of Milan.\"[347]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 346: _i.e._ the other ex votos.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 347: There is apparently some satirical allusion here, which\r\nI cannot undertake to explain.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Seventh]\r\n\r\n     TOFANO ONE NIGHT SHUTTETH HIS WIFE OUT OF DOORS, WHO,\r\n     AVAILING NOT TO RE-ENTER BY DINT OF ENTREATIES, FEIGNETH TO\r\n     CAST HERSELF INTO A WELL AND CASTETH THEREIN A GREAT STONE.\r\n     TOFANO COMETH FORTH OF THE HOUSE AND RUNNETH THITHER,\r\n     WHEREUPON SHE SLIPPETH IN AND LOCKING HIM OUT, BAWLETH\r\n     REPROACHES AT HIM FROM THE WINDOW\r\n\r\n\r\nThe king no sooner perceived Elisa's story to be ended than, turning\r\nwithout delay to Lauretta, he signified to her his pleasure that she\r\nshould tell; whereupon she, without hesitation, began thus, \"O Love,\r\nhow great and how various is thy might! How many thy resources and thy\r\ndevices! What philosopher, what craftsman[348] could ever have availed\r\nor might avail to teach those shifts, those feints, those subterfuges\r\nwhich thou on the spur of the moment suggestest to whoso ensueth in\r\nthy traces! Certes, all others' teaching is halting compared with\r\nthine, as may very well have been apprehended by the devices which\r\nhave already been set forth and to which, lovesome ladies, I will add\r\none practised by a woman of a simple wit enough and such as I know\r\nnone but Love could have taught her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 348: Syn. professor of the liberal arts (_artista_).]\r\n\r\nThere was once, then, in Arezzo, a rich man called Tofano and he was\r\ngiven to wife a very fair lady, by name Madam Ghita, of whom, without\r\nknowing why, he quickly waxed jealous. The lady, becoming aware of\r\nthis, was despited thereat and questioned him once and again of the\r\nreason of his jealousy; but he was able to assign her none, save such\r\nas were general and naught; wherefore it occurred to her mind to cause\r\nhim die of the disease whereof he stood without reason in fear.\r\nAccordingly, perceiving that a young man, who was much to her taste,\r\nsighed for her, she proceeded discreetly to come to an understanding\r\nwith him and things being so far advanced between them that there\r\nlacked but with deeds to give effect to words, she cast about for a\r\nmeans of bringing this also to pass; wherefore, having already\r\nremarked, amongst her husband's other ill usances, that he delighted\r\nin drinking, she began not only to commend this to him, but would\r\noften artfully incite him thereto. This became so much his wont that,\r\nwell nigh whensoever it pleased her, she led him to drink even to\r\nintoxication, and putting him to bed whenas she saw him well drunken,\r\nshe a first time foregathered with her lover, with whom many a time\r\nthereafter she continued to do so in all security. Indeed, she grew to\r\nput such trust in her husband's drunkenness that not only did she make\r\nbold to bring her gallant into the house, but went whiles to pass a\r\ngreat part of the night with him in his own house, which was not very\r\nfar distant.\r\n\r\nThe enamoured lady continuing on this wise, it befell that the\r\nwretched husband came to perceive that she, whilst encouraging him to\r\ndrink, natheless herself drank never; wherefore suspicion took him\r\nthat it might be as in truth it was, to wit, that she made him\r\ndrunken, so she might after do her pleasure what while he slept, and\r\nwishing to make proof of this, an it were so, he one evening, not\r\nhaving drunken that day, feigned himself, both in words and fashions,\r\nthe drunkenest man that was aye. The lady, believing this and judging\r\nthat he needed no more drink, put him to bed in all haste and this\r\ndone, betook herself, as she was used to do whiles, to the house of\r\nher lover, where she abode till midnight. As for Tofano, no sooner did\r\nhe know the lady to have left the house than he straightway arose and\r\ngoing to the doors, locked them from within; after which he posted\r\nhimself at the window, so he might see her return and show her that he\r\nhad gotten wind of her fashions; and there he abode till such time as\r\nshe came back. The lady, returning home and finding herself locked\r\nout, was beyond measure woeful and began to essay an she might avail\r\nto open the door by force, which, after Tofano had awhile suffered,\r\n'Wife,' quoth he, 'thou weariest thyself in vain, for thou canst\r\nnowise come in here again. Go, get thee back whereas thou hast been\r\ntill now and be assured that thou shalt never return thither till such\r\ntime as I shall have done thee, in respect of this affair, such honour\r\nas beseemeth thee in the presence of thy kinsfolk and of the\r\nneighbours.'\r\n\r\nThe lady fell to beseeching him for the love of God that it would\r\nplease him open to her, for that she came not whence he supposed, but\r\nfrom keeping vigil with a she-neighbour of hers, for that the nights\r\nwere long and she could not sleep them all out nor watch at home\r\nalone. However, prayers profited her nought, for that her brute of a\r\nhusband was minded to have all the Aretines[349] know their shame,\r\nwhereas none as yet knew it; wherefore, seeing that prayers availed\r\nher not, she had recourse to threats and said, 'An thou open not to\r\nme, I will make thee the woefullest man alive.' 'And what canst thou\r\ndo to me?' asked Tofano, and Mistress Tessa, whose wits Love had\r\nalready whetted with his counsels, replied, 'Rather than brook the\r\nshame which thou wouldst wrongfully cause me suffer, I will cast\r\nmyself into this well that is herenigh, where when I am found dead,\r\nthere is none will believe otherwise than that thou, for very\r\ndrunkenness, hast cast me therein; wherefore it will behove thee flee\r\nand lose all thou hast and abide in banishment or have thy head cut\r\noff for my murderer, as thou wilt in truth have been.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 349: _i.e._ inhabitants of Arezzo.]\r\n\r\nTofano was nowise moved by these words from his besotted intent;\r\nwherefore quoth she to him, 'Harkye now, I can no longer brook this\r\nthy fashery, God pardon it thee! Look thou cause lay up[350] this\r\ndistaff of mine that I leave here.' So saying, the night being so dark\r\nthat one might scarce see other by the way, she went up to the well\r\nand taking a great stone that lay thereby, cried out, 'God pardon me!'\r\nand let it drop into the water. The stone, striking the water, made a\r\nvery great noise, which when Tofano heard, he verily believed that she\r\nhad cast herself in; wherefore, snatching up the bucket and the rope,\r\nhe rushed out of the house and ran to the well to succour her. The\r\nlady, who had hidden herself near the door, no sooner saw him run to\r\nthe well than she slipped into the house and locked herself in; then,\r\ngetting her to the window, 'You should water your wine, whenas you\r\ndrink it,' quoth she, 'and not after and by night.' Tofano, hearing\r\nthis, knew himself to have been fooled and returned to the door, but\r\ncould get no admission and proceeded to bid her open to him; but she\r\nleft speaking softly, as she had done till then, and began, well nigh\r\nat a scream, to say, 'By Christ His Cross, tiresome sot that thou art,\r\nthou shalt not enter here to-night; I cannot brook these thy fashions\r\nany longer; needs must I let every one see what manner of man thou art\r\nand at what hour thou comest home anights.' Tofano, on his side,\r\nflying into a rage, began to rail at her and bawl; whereupon the\r\nneighbours, hearing the clamour, arose, both men and women, and coming\r\nto the windows, asked what was to do. The lady answered, weeping, 'It\r\nis this wretch of a man, who still returneth to me of an evening,\r\ndrunken, or falleth asleep about the taverns and after cometh home at\r\nthis hour; the which I have long suffered, but, it availing me not and\r\nI being unable to put up with it longer, I have bethought me to shame\r\nhim therefor by locking him out of doors, to see and he will mend\r\nhimself thereof.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 350: _Riporre_, possibly a mistake for _riportare_, to fetch\r\nback.]\r\n\r\nTofano, on the other hand, told them, like an ass as he was, how the\r\ncase stood and threatened her sore; but she said to the neighbours,\r\n'Look you now what a man he is! What would you say, were I in the\r\nstreet, as he is, and he in the house, as am I? By God His faith, I\r\ndoubt me you would believe he said sooth. By this you may judge of his\r\nwits; he saith I have done just what methinketh he hath himself done.\r\nHe thought to fear me by casting I know not what into the well; but\r\nwould God he had cast himself there in good sooth and drowned himself,\r\nso he might have well watered the wine which he hath drunken to\r\nexcess.' The neighbours, both men and women, all fell to blaming\r\nTofano, holding him at fault, and chid him for that which he said\r\nagainst the lady; and in a short time the report was so noised abroad\r\nfrom neighbour to neighbour that it reached the ears of the lady's\r\nkinsfolk, who came thither and hearing the thing from one and another\r\nof the neighbours, took Tofano and gave him such a drubbing that they\r\nbroke every bone in his body. Then, entering the house, they took the\r\nlady's gear and carried her off home with them, threatening Tofano\r\nwith worse. The latter, finding himself in ill case and seeing that\r\nhis jealousy had brought him to a sorry pass, for that he still loved\r\nhis wife heartily,[351] procured certain friends to intercede for him\r\nand so wrought that he made his peace with the lady and had her home\r\nagain with him, promising her that he would never be jealous again.\r\nMoreover, he gave her leave to do her every pleasure, provided she\r\nwrought so discreetly that he should know nothing thereof; and on this\r\nwise, like a crack-brained churl as he was, he made peace after\r\nsuffering damage. So long live Love and death to war and all its\r\ncompany!\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 351: Lit. wished her all his weal.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Seventh]\r\n\r\n     A JEALOUS HUSBAND, IN THE GUISE OF A PRIEST, CONFESSETH HIS\r\n     WIFE, WHO GIVETH HIM TO BELIEVE THAT SHE LOVETH A PRIEST,\r\n     WHO COMETH TO HER EVERY NIGHT; AND WHILST THE HUSBAND\r\n     SECRETLY KEEPETH WATCH AT THE DOOR FOR THE LATTER, THE LADY\r\n     BRINGETH IN A LOVER OF HERS BY THE ROOF AND LIETH WITH HIM\r\n\r\n\r\nLauretta having made an end of her story and all having commended the\r\nlady for that she had done aright and even as befitted her wretch of a\r\nhusband, the king, to lose no time, turned to Fiammetta and\r\ncourteously imposed on her the burden of the story-telling; whereupon\r\nshe began thus, \"Most noble ladies, the foregoing story moveth me to\r\ntell you, on like wise, of a jealous husband, accounting, as I do, all\r\nthat their wives do unto such,--particularly whenas they are jealous\r\nwithout cause,--to be well done and holding that, if the makers of the\r\nlaws had considered everything, they should have appointed none other\r\npenalty unto women who offend in this than that which they appoint\r\nunto whoso offendeth against other in self-defence; for that jealous\r\nmen are plotters against the lives of young women and most diligent\r\nprocurers of their deaths. Wives abide all the week mewed up at home,\r\noccupying themselves with domestic offices and the occasions of their\r\nfamilies and households, and after they would fain, like every one\r\nelse, have some solace and some rest on holidays and be at leisure to\r\ntake some diversion even as do the tillers of the fields, the artisans\r\nof the towns and the administrators of the laws, according to the\r\nexample of God himself, who rested from all His labours the seventh\r\nday, and to the intent of the laws, both human and Divine, which,\r\nlooking to the honour of God and the common weal of all, have\r\ndistinguished working days from those of repose. But to this jealous\r\nmen will on no wise consent; nay, those days which are gladsome for\r\nall other women they make wretcheder and more doleful than the others\r\nto their wives, keeping them yet closelier straitened and confined;\r\nand what a misery and a languishment this is for the poor creatures\r\nthose only know who have proved it. Wherefore, to conclude, I say that\r\nwhat a woman doth to a husband who is jealous without cause should\r\ncertes not be condemned, but rather commended.\r\n\r\nThere was, then, in Arimino a merchant, very rich both in lands and\r\nmonies, who, having to wife a very fair lady, became beyond measure\r\njealous of her; nor had he other cause for this save that, as he loved\r\nher exceedingly and held her very fair and saw that she studied with\r\nall her might to please him, even so he imagined that every man loved\r\nher and that she appeared fair to all and eke that she studied to\r\nplease others as she did himself, which was the reasoning of a man of\r\nnought and one of little sense. Being grown thus jealous, he kept such\r\nstrict watch over her and held her in such constraint that belike many\r\nthere be of those who are condemned to capital punishment who are less\r\nstraitly guarded of their gaolers; for, far from being at liberty to\r\ngo to weddings or entertainments or to church or indeed anywise to set\r\nfoot without the house, she dared not even stand at the window nor\r\nlook abroad on any occasion; wherefore her life was most wretched and\r\nshe brooked this annoy with the more impatience as she felt herself\r\nthe less to blame. Accordingly, seeing herself unjustly suspected of\r\nher husband, she determined, for her own solacement, to find a means\r\n(an she but might) of doing on such wise that he should have reason\r\nfor his ill usage of her. And for that she might not station herself\r\nat the window and so had no opportunity of showing herself favourable\r\nto the suit of any one who might take note of her, as he passed along\r\nher street, and pay his court to her,--knowing that in the adjoining\r\nhouse there was a certain young man both handsome and agreeable,--she\r\nbethought herself to look if there were any hole in the wall that\r\nparted the two houses and therethrough to spy once and again till such\r\ntime as she should see the youth aforesaid and find an occasion of\r\nspeaking with him and bestowing on him her love, so he would accept\r\nthereof, purposing, if a means could be found, to foregather with him\r\nbytimes and on this wise while away her sorry life till such time as\r\nthe demon [of jealousy] should take leave of her husband.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, she went spying about the walls of the house, now in one\r\npart and now in another, whenas her husband was abroad, and happened\r\nat last upon a very privy place where the wall was somewhat opened by\r\na fissure and looking therethrough, albeit she could ill discover what\r\nwas on the other side, algates she perceived that the opening gave\r\nupon a bedchamber there and said in herself, 'Should this be the\r\nchamber of Filippo,' to wit, the youth her neighbour, 'I were half\r\nsped.' Then, causing secretly enquire of this by a maid of hers, who\r\nhad pity upon her, she found that the young man did indeed sleep in\r\nthat chamber all alone; wherefore, by dint of often visiting the\r\ncrevice and dropping pebbles and such small matters, whenas she\r\nperceived him to be there, she wrought on such wise that he came to\r\nthe opening, to see what was to do; whereupon she called to him\r\nsoftly. He, knowing her voice, answered her, and she, profiting by the\r\noccasion, discovered to him in brief all her mind; whereat the youth\r\nwas mightily content and made shift to enlarge the hole from his side\r\non such wise that none could perceive it; and therethrough they many a\r\ntime bespoke one another and touched hands, but could go no farther,\r\nfor the jealous vigilance of the husband.\r\n\r\nAfter awhile, the Feast of the Nativity drawing near, the lady told\r\nher husband that, an it pleased him, she would fain go to church on\r\nChristmas morning and confess and take the sacrament, as other\r\nChristians did. Quoth he, 'And what sin hast thou committed that thou\r\nwouldst confess?' 'How?' answered the lady. 'Thinkest thou that I am a\r\nsaint, because thou keepest me mewed up? Thou must know well enough\r\nthat I commit sins like all others that live in this world; but I will\r\nnot tell them to thee, for that thou art not a priest.' The jealous\r\nwretch took suspicion at these words and determined to seek to know\r\nwhat sins she had committed; wherefore, having bethought himself of a\r\nmeans whereby he might gain his end, he answered that he was content,\r\nbut that he would have her go to no other church than their parish\r\nchapel and that thither she must go betimes in the morning and confess\r\nherself either to their chaplain or to such priest as the latter\r\nshould appoint her and to none other and presently return home.\r\nHerseemed she half apprehended his meaning; but without saying\r\notherwhat, she answered that she would do as he said.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Christmas Day come, the lady arose at daybreak and\r\nattiring herself, repaired to the church appointed her of her husband,\r\nwho, on his part, betook himself to the same place and reached it\r\nbefore her. Having already taken order with the chaplain of that which\r\nhe had a mind to do, he hastily donned one of the latter's gowns, with\r\na great flapped cowl, such as we see priests wear, and drawing the\r\nhood a little over his face, seated himself in the choir. The lady,\r\nentering the chapel, enquired for the chaplain, who came and hearing\r\nfrom her that she would fain confess, said that he could not hear her,\r\nbut would send her one of his brethren. Accordingly, going away, he\r\nsent her the jealous man, in an ill hour for the latter, who came up\r\nwith a very grave air, and albeit the day was not over bright and he\r\nhad drawn the cowl far over his eyes, knew not so well to disguise\r\nhimself but he was readily recognized by the lady, who, seeing this,\r\nsaid in herself, 'Praised be God! From a jealous man he is turned\r\npriest; but no matter; I will e'en give him what he goeth seeking.'\r\n\r\nAccordingly, feigning not to know him, she seated herself at his feet.\r\nMy lord Jealousy had put some pebbles in his mouth, to impede his\r\nspeech somewhat, so his wife might not know him by his voice,\r\nhimseeming he was in every other particular so thoroughly disguised\r\nthat he was nowise fearful of being recognized by her. To come to the\r\nconfession, the lady told him, amongst other things, (having first\r\ndeclared herself to be married,) that she was enamoured of a priest,\r\nwho came every night to lie with her. When the jealous man heard this,\r\nhimseemed he had gotten a knife-thrust in the heart, and had not\r\ndesire constrained him to know more, he had abandoned the confession\r\nand gone away. Standing fast, then, he asked the lady, 'How! Doth not\r\nyour husband lie with you?' 'Ay doth he, sir,' replied she. 'How,\r\nthen,' asked the jealous man, 'can the priest also lie with you?'\r\n'Sir,' answered she, 'by what art he doth it I know not, but there is\r\nnot a door in the house so fast locked but it openeth so soon as he\r\ntoucheth it; and he telleth me that, whenas he cometh to the door of\r\nmy chamber, before opening it, he pronounceth certain words, by virtue\r\nwhereof my husband incontinent falleth asleep, and so soon as he\r\nperceiveth him to be fast, he openeth the door and cometh in and lieth\r\nwith me; and this never faileth.' Quoth the mock priest, 'Madam, this\r\nis ill done, and it behoveth you altogether to refrain therefrom.'\r\n'Sir,' answered the lady, 'methinketh I could never do that, for that\r\nI love him too well.' 'Then,' said the other, 'I cannot shrive you.'\r\nQuoth she, 'I am grieved for that; but I came not hither to tell you\r\nlies; an I thought I could do it, I would tell you so.' 'In truth,\r\nmadam,' replied the husband, 'I am concerned for you, for that I see\r\nyou lose your soul at this game; but, to do you service, I will well\r\nto take the pains of putting up my special orisons to God in your\r\nname, the which maybe shall profit you, and I will send you bytimes a\r\nlittle clerk of mine, to whom you shall say if they have profited you\r\nor not; and if they have profited you, we will proceed farther.'\r\n'Sir,' answered the lady, 'whatever you do, send none to me at home,\r\nfor, should my husband come to know of it, he is so terribly jealous\r\nthat nothing in the world would get it out of his head that your\r\nmessenger came hither for nought[352] but ill, and I should have no\r\npeace with him this year to come.' Quoth the other, 'Madam, have no\r\nfear of that, for I will certainly contrive it on such wise that you\r\nshall never hear a word of the matter from him.' Then said she, 'So\r\nbut you can engage to do that, I am content.' Then, having made her\r\nconfession and gotten her penance, she rose to her feet and went off\r\nto hear mass; whilst the jealous man, (ill luck go with him!)\r\nwithdrew, bursting with rage, to put off his priest's habit, and\r\nreturned home, impatient to find a means of surprising the priest with\r\nhis wife, so he might play the one and the other an ill turn.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 352: Boccaccio writes carelessly \"for _aught_\" (_altro_),\r\nwhich makes nonsense of the passage.]\r\n\r\nPresently the lady came back from church and saw plainly enough from\r\nher husband's looks that she had given him an ill Christmas; albeit he\r\nstudied, as most he might, to conceal that which he had done and what\r\nhimseemed he had learned. Then, being inwardly resolved to lie in wait\r\nnear the street-door that night and watch for the priest's coming, he\r\nsaid to the lady, 'Needs must I sup and lie abroad to-night, wherefore\r\nlook thou lock the street-door fast, as well as that of the midstair\r\nand that of thy chamber, and get thee to bed, whenas it seemeth good\r\nto thee.' The lady answered, 'It is well,' and betaking herself, as\r\nsoon as she had leisure, to the hole in the wall, she made the wonted\r\nsignal, which when Filippo heard, he came to her forthright. She told\r\nhim how she had done that morning and what her husband had said to her\r\nafter dinner and added, 'I am certain he will not leave the house, but\r\nwill set himself to watch the door; wherefore do thou find means to\r\ncome hither to me to-night by the roof, so we may lie together.' The\r\nyoung man was mightily rejoiced at this and answered, 'Madam, leave me\r\ndo.'\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the night come, the jealous man took his arms and hid\r\nhimself by stealth in a room on the ground floor, whilst the lady,\r\nwhenas it seemed to her time,--having caused lock all the doors and in\r\nparticular that of the midstair, so he might not avail to come\r\nup,--summoned the young man, who came to her from his side by a very\r\nprivy way. Thereupon they went to bed and gave themselves a good time,\r\ntaking their pleasure one of the other till daybreak, when the young\r\nman returned to his own house. Meanwhile, the jealous man stood to his\r\narms well nigh all night beside the street-door, sorry and supperless\r\nand dying of cold, and waited for the priest to come till near upon\r\nday, when, unable to watch any longer, he returned to the ground floor\r\nroom and there fell asleep. Towards tierce he awoke and the street\r\ndoor being now open, he made a show of returning from otherwhere and\r\nwent up into his house and dined. A little after, he sent a lad, as he\r\nwere the priest's clerkling that had confessed her, to the lady to ask\r\nif she wot of were come thither again. She knew the messenger well\r\nenough and answered that he had not come thither that night and that\r\nif he did thus, he might haply pass out of her mind, albeit she wished\r\nit not. What more should I tell you? The jealous man abode on the\r\nwatch night after night, looking to catch the priest at his entering\r\nin, and the lady still had a merry life with her lover the while.\r\n\r\nAt length the cuckold, able to contain himself no longer, asked his\r\nwife, with an angry air, what she had said to the priest the morning\r\nshe had confessed herself to him. She answered that she would not tell\r\nhim, for that it was neither a just thing nor a seemly; whereupon,\r\n'Vile woman that thou art!' cried he. 'In despite of thee I know what\r\nthou saidst to him, and needs must I know the priest of whom thou art\r\nso mightily enamoured and who, by means of his conjurations, lieth\r\nwith thee every night; else will I slit thy weasand.' She replied that\r\nit was not true that she was enamoured of any priest. 'How?' cried the\r\nhusband, 'Saidst thou not thus and thus to the priest who confessed\r\nthee?' And she, 'Thou couldst not have reported it better, not to say\r\nif he had told it thee, but if thou hadst been present; ay, I did tell\r\nhim this.' 'Then,' rejoined the jealous man, 'tell me who is this\r\npriest, and that quickly.'\r\n\r\nThe lady fell a-smiling and answered, 'It rejoiceth me mightily to see\r\na wise man led by the nose by a woman, even as one leadeth a ram by\r\nthe horns to the shambles, albeit thou art no longer wise nor hast\r\nbeen since the hour when, unknowing why, thou sufferedst the malignant\r\nspirit of jealousy to enter thy breast; and the sillier and more\r\nbesotted thou art, so much the less is my glory thereof. Deemest thou,\r\nhusband mine, I am as blind of the eyes of the body as thou of those\r\nof the mind? Certes, no; I perceived at first sight who was the priest\r\nthat confessed me and know that thou wast he; but I had it at heart to\r\ngive thee that which thou wentest seeking, and in sooth I have done\r\nit. Wert thou as wise as thou thinkest to be, thou wouldst not have\r\nessayed by this means to learn the secrets of thy good wife, but\r\nwouldst, without taking vain suspicion, have recognized that which she\r\nconfessed to thee to be the very truth, without her having sinned in\r\naught. I told thee that I loved a priest, and wast not thou, whom I am\r\nmuch to blame to love as I do, become a priest? I told thee that no\r\ndoor of my house could abide locked, whenas he had a mind to lie with\r\nme; and what door in the house was ever kept against thee, whenas thou\r\nwouldst come whereas I might be? I told thee that the priest lay with\r\nme every night, and when was it that thou layest not with me? And\r\nwhenassoever thou sentest thy clerk to me, which was thou knowest, as\r\noften as thou layest from me, I sent thee word that the priest had not\r\nbeen with me. What other than a crack-brain like thee, who has\r\nsuffered thyself to be blinded by thy jealousy, had failed to\r\nunderstand these things? Thou hast abidden in the house, keeping\r\nwatch anights, and thoughtest to have given me to believe that thou\r\nwast gone abroad to sup and sleep. Bethink thee henceforth and become\r\na man again, as thou wast wont to be; and make not thyself a laughing\r\nstock to whoso knoweth thy fashions, as do I, and leave this\r\nunconscionable watching that thou keepest; for I swear to God that, an\r\nthe fancy took me to make thee wear the horns, I would engage, haddest\r\nthou an hundred eyes, as thou hast but two, to do my pleasure on such\r\nwise that thou shouldst not be ware thereof.'\r\n\r\nThe jealous wretch, who thought to have very adroitly surprised his\r\nwife's secrets, hearing this, avouched himself befooled and without\r\nanswering otherwhat, held the lady for virtuous and discreet; and\r\nwhenas it behoved him to be jealous, he altogether divested himself of\r\nhis jealousy, even as he had put it on, what time he had no need\r\nthereof. Wherefore the discreet lady, being in a manner licensed to do\r\nher pleasures, thenceforward no longer caused her lover to come to her\r\nby the roof, as go the cats, but e'en brought him in at the door, and\r\ndealing advisedly, many a day thereafter gave herself a good time and\r\nled a merry life with him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Seventh]\r\n\r\n     MADAM ISABELLA, BEING IN COMPANY WITH LEONETTO HER LOVER, IS\r\n     VISITED BY ONE MESSER LAMBERTUCCIO, OF WHOM SHE IS BELOVED;\r\n     HER HUSBAND RETURNING, [UNEXPECTED,] SHE SENDETH\r\n     LAMBERTUCCIO FORTH OF THE HOUSE, WHINGER IN HAND, AND THE\r\n     HUSBAND AFTER ESCORTETH LEONETTO HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nThe company were wonder-well pleased with Fiammetta's story, all\r\naffirming that the lady had done excellently well and as it behoved\r\nunto such a brute of a man, and after it was ended, the king bade\r\nPampinea follow on, who proceeded to say, \"There are many who,\r\nspeaking ignorantly, avouch that love bereaveth folk of their senses\r\nand causeth whoso loveth to become witless. Meseemeth this is a\r\nfoolish opinion, as hath indeed been well enough shown by the things\r\nalready related, and I purpose yet again to demonstrate it.\r\n\r\nIn our city, which aboundeth in all good things, there was once a\r\nyoung lady both gently born and very fair, who was the wife of a very\r\nworthy and notable gentleman; and as it happeneth often that folk\r\ncannot for ever brook one same food, but desire bytimes to vary their\r\ndiet, this lady, her husband not altogether satisfying her, became\r\nenamoured of a young man called Leonetto and very well bred and\r\nagreeable, for all he was of no great extraction. He on like wise fell\r\nin love with her, and as you know that seldom doth that which both\r\nparties desire abide without effect, it was no great while before\r\naccomplishment was given to their loves. Now it chanced that, she\r\nbeing a fair and engaging lady, a gentleman called Messer\r\nLambertuccio became sore enamoured of her, whom, for that he seemed\r\nto her a disagreeable man and a tiresome, she could not for aught in\r\nthe world bring herself to love. However, after soliciting her amain\r\nwith messages and it availing him nought, he sent to her threatening\r\nher, for that he was a notable man, to dishonour her, an she did not\r\nhis pleasure; wherefore she, fearful and knowing his character,\r\nsubmitted herself to do his will.\r\n\r\nIt chanced one day that the lady, whose name was Madam Isabella, being\r\ngone, as is our custom in summer-time, to abide at a very goodly\r\nestate she had in the country and her husband having ridden\r\nsomewhither to pass some days abroad, she sent for Leonetto to come\r\nand be with her, whereat he was mightily rejoiced and betook himself\r\nthither incontinent. Meanwhile Messer Lambertuccio, hearing that her\r\nhusband was gone abroad, took horse and repairing, all alone, to her\r\nhouse, knocked at the door. The lady's waiting-woman, seeing him, came\r\nstraight to her mistress, who was closeted with Leonetto, and called\r\nto her, saying, 'Madam, Messer Lambertuccio is below, all alone.' The\r\nlady, hearing this, was the woefullest woman in the world, but, as she\r\nstood in great fear of Messer Lambertuccio, she besought Leonetto not\r\nto take it ill to hide himself awhile behind the curtains of her bed\r\ntill such time as the other should be gone. Accordingly, Leonetto, who\r\nfeared him no less than did the lady, hid himself there and she bade\r\nthe maid go open to Messer Lambertuccio, which being done, he lighted\r\ndown in the courtyard and making his palfrey fast to a staple there,\r\nwent up into the house. The lady put on a cheerful countenance and\r\ncoming to the head of the stair, received him with as good a grace as\r\nshe might and asked him what brought him thither; whereupon he caught\r\nher in his arms and clipped her and kissed her, saying, 'My soul, I\r\nunderstood that your husband was abroad and am come accordingly to be\r\nwith you awhile.' After these words, they entered a bedchamber, where\r\nthey locked themselves in, and Messer Lambertuccio fell to taking\r\ndelight of her.\r\n\r\nAs they were thus engaged, it befell, altogether out of the lady's\r\nexpectation, that her husband returned, whom when the maid saw near\r\nthe house, she ran in haste to the lady's chamber and said, 'Madam,\r\nhere is my lord come back; methinketh he is already below in the\r\ncourtyard.' When the lady heard this, bethinking her that she had two\r\nmen in the house and knowing that there was no hiding Messer\r\nLambertuccio, by reason of his palfrey which was in the courtyard, she\r\ngave herself up for lost. Nevertheless, taking a sudden resolution,\r\nshe sprang hastily down from the bed and said to Messer Lambertuccio,\r\n'Sir, an you wish me anywise well and would save me from death, do\r\nthat which I shall bid you. Take your hanger naked in your hand and go\r\ndown the stair with an angry air and all disordered and begone,\r\nsaying, \"I vow to God that I will take him elsewhere.\" And should my\r\nhusband offer to detain you or question you of aught, do you say no\r\notherwhat than that which I have told you, but take horse and look you\r\nabide not with him on any account.' The gentleman answered that he\r\nwould well, and accordingly, drawing his hanger, he did as she had\r\nenjoined him, with a face all afire what with the swink he had\r\nfurnished and with anger at the husband's return. The latter was by\r\nthis dismounted in the courtyard and marvelled to see the palfrey\r\nthere; then, offering to go up into the house, he saw Messer\r\nLambertuccio come down and wondering both at his words and his air,\r\nsaid, 'What is this, sir?' Messer Lambertuccio putting his foot in the\r\nstirrup and mounting to horse, said nought but, 'Cock's body, I shall\r\nfind him again otherwhere,' and made off.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman, going up, found his wife at the stairhead, all\r\ndisordered and fearful, and said to her, 'What is all this? Whom goeth\r\nMesser Lambertuccio threatening thus in such a fury?' The lady,\r\nwithdrawing towards the chamber where Leonetto was, so he might hear\r\nher, answered, 'Sir, never had I the like of this fright. There came\r\nfleeing hither but now a young man, whom I know not, followed by\r\nMesser Lambertuccio, hanger in hand, and finding by chance the door of\r\nthis chamber open, said to me, all trembling, \"For God's sake, madam,\r\nhelp me, that I be not slain in your arms.\" I rose to my feet and was\r\nabout to question him who he was and what ailed him, when, behold, in\r\nrushed Messer Lambertuccio, saying, \"Where art thou, traitor?\" I set\r\nmyself before the chamber-door and hindered him from entering; and he\r\nwas in so far courteous that, after many words, seeing it pleased me\r\nnot that he should enter there, he went his way down, as you have\r\nseen.' Quoth the husband, 'Wife, thou didst well, it were too great a\r\nreproach to us, had a man been slain in our house, and Messer\r\nLambertuccio did exceeding unmannerly to follow a person who had taken\r\nrefuge here.'\r\n\r\nThen he asked where the young man was, and the lady answered, 'Indeed\r\nsir, I know not where he hath hidden himself.' Then said the husband\r\n'Where art thou? Come forth in safety.' Whereupon Leonetto, who had\r\nheard everything, came forth all trembling for fear, (as indeed he had\r\nhad a great fright,) of the place where he had hidden himself, and the\r\ngentleman said to him, 'What hast thou to do with Messer\r\nLambertuccio?' 'Sir,' answered he, 'I have nothing in the world to do\r\nwith him, wherefore methinketh assuredly he is either not in his right\r\nwits or he hath mistaken me for another; for that no sooner did he set\r\neyes on me in the road not far from this house than he forthright\r\nclapped his hand to his hanger and said, \"Traitor, thou art a dead\r\nman!\" I stayed not to ask why, but took to my heels as best I might\r\nand made my way hither, where, thanks to God and to this gentlewoman,\r\nI have escaped.' Quoth the husband, 'Go to; have no fears; I will\r\nbring thee to thine own house safe and sound, and thou canst after\r\nseek out what thou hast to do with him.' Accordingly, when they had\r\nsupped, he mounted him a-horseback and carrying him back to Florence,\r\nleft him in his own house. As for Leonetto, that same evening,\r\naccording as he had been lessoned of the lady, he privily bespoke\r\nMesser Lambertuccio and took such order with him, albeit there was\r\nmuch talk of the matter thereafterward, the husband never for all that\r\nbecame aware of the cheat that had been put on him by his wife.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Seventh]\r\n\r\n     LODOVICO DISCOVERETH TO MADAM BEATRICE THE LOVE HE BEARETH\r\n     HER, WHEREUPON SHE SENDETH EGANO HER HUSBAND INTO THE\r\n     GARDEN, IN HER OWN FAVOUR, AND LIETH MEANWHILE WITH\r\n     LODOVICO, WHO, PRESENTLY ARISING, GOETH AND CUDGELLETH EGANO\r\n     IN THE GARDEN\r\n\r\n\r\nMadam Isabella's presence of mind, as related by Pampinea, was held\r\nadmirable by all the company; but, whilst they yet marvelled thereat,\r\nFilomena, whom the king had appointed to follow on, said, \"Lovesome\r\nladies, and I mistake not, methinketh I can tell you no less goodly a\r\nstory on the same subject, and that forthright.\r\n\r\nYou must know, then, that there was once in Paris a Florentine\r\ngentleman, who was for poverty turned merchant and had thriven so well\r\nin commerce that he was grown thereby very rich. He had by his lady\r\none only son, whom he had named Lodovico, and for that he might\r\nconcern himself with his father's nobility and not with trade, he had\r\nwilled not to place him in any warehouse, but had sent him to be with\r\nother gentlemen in the service of the King of France, where he learned\r\nstore of goodly manners and other fine things. During his sojourn\r\nthere, it befell that certain gentlemen, who were returned from\r\nvisiting the Holy Sepulchre, coming in upon a conversation between\r\ncertain young men, of whom Lodovico was one, and hearing them\r\ndiscourse among themselves of the fair ladies of France and England\r\nand other parts of the world, one of them began to say that assuredly,\r\nin all the lands he had traversed and for all the ladies he had seen,\r\nhe had never beheld the like for beauty of Madam Beatrice, the wife of\r\nMesser Egano de' Gulluzzi of Bologna; to which all his companions, who\r\nhad with him seen her at Bologna, agreed.\r\n\r\nLodovico, who had never yet been enamoured of any woman, hearkening to\r\nthis, was fired with such longing to see her that he could hold his\r\nthought to nothing else and being altogether resolved to journey to\r\nBologna for that purpose and there, if she pleased him, to abide\r\nawhile, he feigned to his father that he had a mind to go visit the\r\nHoly Sepulchre, the which with great difficulty he obtained of him.\r\nAccordingly, taking the name of Anichino, he set out for Bologna, and\r\non the day following [his arrival,] as fortune would have it, he saw\r\nthe lady in question at an entertainment, where she seemed to him\r\nfairer far than he had imagined her; wherefore, falling most ardently\r\nenamoured of her, he resolved never to depart Bologna till he should\r\nhave gained her love. Then, devising in himself what course he should\r\ntake to this end, he bethought himself, leaving be all other means,\r\nthat, an he might but avail to become one of her husband's servants,\r\nwhereof he entertained many, he might peradventure compass that which\r\nhe desired. Accordingly, having sold his horses and disposed as best\r\nmight be of his servants, bidding them make a show of knowing him not,\r\nhe entered into discourse with his host and told him that he would\r\nfain engage for a servant with some gentleman of condition, could\r\nsuch an one be found. Quoth the host, 'Thou art the right serving-man\r\nto please a gentleman of this city, by name Egano, who keepeth many\r\nand will have them all well looking, as thou art. I will bespeak him\r\nof the matter.' As he said, so he did, and ere he took leave of Egano,\r\nhe had brought Anichino to an accord with him, to the exceeding\r\nsatisfaction of the latter, who, abiding with Egano and having\r\nabundant opportunity of seeing his lady often, proceeded to serve him\r\nso well and so much to his liking that he set such store by him that\r\nhe could do nothing without him and committed to him the governance,\r\nnot of himself alone, but of all his affairs.\r\n\r\nIt chanced one day that, Egano being gone a-fowling and having left\r\nAnichino at home, Madam Beatrice (who was not yet become aware of his\r\nlove for her, albeit, considering him and his fashions, she had\r\nofttimes much commended him to herself and he pleased her,) fell to\r\nplaying chess with him and he, desiring to please her, very adroitly\r\ncontrived to let himself be beaten, whereat the lady was marvellously\r\nrejoiced. Presently, all her women having gone away from seeing them\r\nplay and left them playing alone, Anichino heaved a great sigh,\r\nwhereupon she looked at him and said, 'What aileth thee, Anichino?\r\nDoth it irk thee that I should beat thee?' 'Madam,' answered he, 'a\r\nfar greater thing than that was the cause of my sighing.' Quoth the\r\nlady, 'Prithee, as thou wishest me well, tell it me.' When Anichino\r\nheard himself conjured, 'as thou wishest me well,' by her whom he\r\nloved over all else, he heaved a sigh yet heavier than the first;\r\nwherefore the lady besought him anew that it would please him tell her\r\nthe cause of his sighing. 'Madam,' replied Anichino, 'I am sore\r\nfearful lest it displease you, if I tell it you, and moreover I\r\nmisdoubt me you will tell it again to others.' Whereto rejoined she,\r\n'Certes, it will not displease me, and thou mayst be assured that,\r\nwhatsoever thou sayest to me I will never tell to any, save whenas it\r\nshall please thee.' Quoth he, 'Since you promise me this, I will e'en\r\ntell it you.' Then, with tears in his eyes, he told her who he was and\r\nwhat he had heard of her and when and how he was become enamoured of\r\nher and why he had taken service with her husband and after humbly\r\nbesought her that it would please her have compassion on him and\r\ncomply with him in that his secret and so fervent desire, and in case\r\nshe willed not to do this, that she should suffer him to love her,\r\nleaving him be in that his then present guise.\r\n\r\nO singular blandness of the Bolognese blood! How art thou still to be\r\ncommended in such circumstance! Never wast thou desirous of tears or\r\nsighs; still wast thou compliant unto prayers and amenable unto\r\namorous desires! Had I words worthy to commend thee, my voice should\r\nnever weary of singing thy praises. The gentle lady, what while\r\nAnichino spoke, kept her eyes fixed on him and giving full credence to\r\nhis words, received, by the prevalence of his prayers, the love of him\r\nwith such might into her heart that she also fell a-sighing and\r\npresently answered, 'Sweet my Anichino, be of good courage; neither\r\npresents nor promises nor solicitations of nobleman or gentleman or\r\nother (for I have been and am yet courted of many) have ever availed\r\nto move my heart to love any one of them; but thou, in this small\r\nspace of time that thy words have lasted, hast made me far more thine\r\nthan mine own. Methinketh thou hast right well earned my love,\r\nwherefore I give it thee and promise thee that I will cause thee have\r\nenjoyment thereof ere this next night be altogether spent. And that\r\nthis may have effect, look thou come to my chamber about midnight. I\r\nwill leave the door open; thou knowest which side the bed I lie; do\r\nthou come thither and if I sleep, touch me so I may awake, and I will\r\nease thee of this so long desire that thou hast had. And that thou\r\nmayst believe this that I say, I will e'en give thee a kiss by way of\r\narles.' Accordingly, throwing her arms about his neck, she kissed him\r\namorously and he on like wise kissed her. These things said, he left\r\nher and went to do certain occasions of his, awaiting with the\r\ngreatest gladness in the world the coming of the night.\r\n\r\nPresently, Egano returned from fowling and being weary, betook himself\r\nto bed, as soon as he had supper, and after him the lady, who left the\r\nchamber-door open, as she had promised. Thither, at the appointed\r\nhour, came Anichino and softly entering the chamber, shut the door\r\nagain from within; then, going up to the bed on the side where the\r\nlady lay, he put his hand to her breast and found her awake. As soon\r\nas she felt him come, she took his hand in both her own and held it\r\nfast; then, turning herself about in the bed, she did on such wise\r\nthat Egano, who was asleep, awoke; whereupon quoth she to him, 'I\r\nwould not say aught to thee yestereve, for that meseemed thou was\r\nweary; but tell me, Egano, so God save thee, whom holdest thou thy\r\nbest and trustiest servant and him who most loveth thee of those whom\r\nthou hast in the house?' 'Wife,' answered Egano, 'what is this whereof\r\nthou askest me? Knowest thou it not? I have not nor had aye any in\r\nwhom I so trusted and whom I loved as I love and trust in Anichino.\r\nBut why dost thou ask me thereof?'\r\n\r\nAnichino, seeing Egano awake and hearing talk of himself, was sore\r\nafraid lest the lady had a mind to cozen him and offered again and\r\nagain to draw his hand away, so he might begone; but she held it so\r\nfast that he could not win free. Then said she to Egano, 'I will tell\r\nthee. I also believed till to-day that he was even such as thou sayest\r\nand that he was more loyal to thee than any other, but he hath\r\nundeceived me; for that, what while thou wentest a-fowling to-day, he\r\nabode here, and whenas it seemed to him time, he was not ashamed to\r\nsolicit me to yield myself to his pleasures, and I, so I might make\r\nthee touch and see this thing and that it might not behove me certify\r\nthee thereof with too many proofs, replied that I would well and that\r\nthis very night, after midnight, I would go into our garden and there\r\nawait him at the foot of the pine. Now for my part I mean not to go\r\nthither; but thou, an thou have a mind to know thy servant's fidelity,\r\nthou mayst lightly do it by donning a gown and a veil of mine and\r\ngoing down yonder to wait and see if he will come thither, as I am\r\nassured he will.' Egano hearing this, answered, 'Certes, needs must I\r\ngo see,' and rising, donned one of the lady's gowns, as best he knew\r\nin the dark; then, covering his head with a veil, he betook himself to\r\nthe garden and proceeded to await Anichino at the foot of the pine.\r\n\r\nAs for the lady, as soon as she knew him gone forth of the chamber,\r\nshe arose and locked the door from within, whilst Anichino, (who had\r\nhad the greatest fright he had ever known and had enforced himself as\r\nmost he might to escape from the lady's hands, cursing her and her\r\nlove and himself who had trusted in her an hundred thousand times,)\r\nseeing this that she had done in the end, was the joyfullest man that\r\nwas aye. Then, she having returned to bed, he, at her bidding, put off\r\nhis clothes and coming to bed to her, they took delight and pleasure\r\ntogether a pretty while; after which, herseeming he should not abide\r\nlonger, she caused him arise and dress himself and said to him,\r\n'Sweetheart, do thou take a stout cudgel and get thee to the garden\r\nand there, feigning to have solicited me to try me, rate Egano, as he\r\nwere I, and ring me a good peal of bells on his back with the cudgel,\r\nfor that thereof will ensue to us marvellous pleasance and delight.'\r\nAnichino accordingly repaired to the garden, with a sallow-stick in\r\nhis hand, and Egano, seeing him draw near the pine, rose up and came\r\nto meet him, as he would receive him with the utmost joy; whereupon\r\nquoth Anichino, 'Ah, wicked woman, art thou then come hither, and\r\nthinkest thou I would do my lord such a wrong? A thousand times ill\r\ncome to thee!' Then, raising the cudgel, he began to lay on to him.\r\n\r\nEgano, hearing this and seeing the cudgel, took to his heels, without\r\nsaying a word, whilst Anichino still followed after him, saying, 'Go\r\nto, God give thee an ill year, vile woman that thou art! I will\r\ncertainly tell it to Egano to-morrow morning.' Egano made his way back\r\nto the chamber as quickliest he might, having gotten sundry good\r\nclouts, and being questioned of the lady if Anichino had come to the\r\ngarden, 'Would God he had not!' answered he. 'For that, taking me for\r\nthee, he hath cudgelled me to a mummy and given me the soundest rating\r\nthat was aye bestowed upon lewd woman. Certes, I marvelled sore at him\r\nthat he should have said these words to thee, with intent to do aught\r\nthat might be a shame to me; but, for that he saw thee so blithe and\r\ngamesome, he had a mind to try thee.' Then said the lady, 'Praised be\r\nGod that he hath tried me with words and thee with deeds! Methinketh\r\nhe may say that I suffered his words more patiently than thou his\r\ndeeds. But, since he is so loyal to thee, it behoveth thee hold him\r\ndear and do him honour.' 'Certes,' answered Egano, 'thou sayst sooth';\r\nand reasoning by this, he concluded that he had the truest wife and\r\nthe trustiest servant that ever gentleman had; by reason whereof,\r\nalbeit both he and the lady made merry more than once with Anichino\r\nover this adventure, the latter and his mistress had leisure enough of\r\nthat which belike, but for this, they would not have had, to wit, to\r\ndo that which afforded them pleasance and delight, that while it\r\npleased Anichino abide with Egano in Bologna.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Seventh]\r\n\r\n     A MAN WAXETH JEALOUS OF HIS WIFE, WHO BINDETH A PIECE OF\r\n     PACKTHREAD TO HER GREAT TOE ANIGHTS, SO SHE MAY HAVE NOTICE\r\n     OF HER LOVER'S COMING. ONE NIGHT HER HUSBAND BECOMETH AWARE\r\n     OF THIS DEVICE AND WHAT WHILE HE PURSUETH THE LOVER, THE\r\n     LADY PUTTETH ANOTHER WOMAN TO BED IN HER ROOM. THIS LATTER\r\n     THE HUSBAND BEATETH AND CUTTETH OFF HER HAIR, THEN FETCHETH\r\n     HIS WIFE'S BROTHERS, WHO, FINDING HIS STORY [SEEMINGLY]\r\n     UNTRUE, GIVE HIM HARD WORDS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed to them all that Madam Beatrice had been extraordinarily\r\ningenious in cozening her husband and all agreed that Anichino's\r\nfright must have been very great, whenas, being the while held fast by\r\nthe lady, he heard her say that he had required her of love. But the\r\nking, seeing Filomena silent, turned to Neifile and said to her, \"Do\r\nyou tell\"; whereupon she, smiling first a little, began, \"Fair ladies,\r\nI have a hard task before me if I desire to pleasure you with a goodly\r\nstory, as those of you have done, who have already told; but, with\r\nGod's aid, I trust to discharge myself thereof well enough.\r\n\r\nYou must know, then, that there was once in our city a very rich\r\nmerchant called Arriguccio Berlinghieri, who, foolishly thinking, as\r\nmerchants yet do every day, to ennoble himself by marriage, took to\r\nwife a young gentlewoman ill sorting with himself, by name Madam\r\nSismonda, who, for that he, merchant-like, was much abroad and\r\nsojourned little with her, fell in love with a young man called\r\nRuberto, who had long courted her, and clapped up a lover's privacy\r\nwith him. Using belike over-little discretion in her dealings with her\r\nlover, for that they were supremely delightsome to her, it chanced\r\nthat, whether Arriguccio scented aught of the matter or how else\r\nsoever it happened, the latter became the most jealous man alive and\r\nleaving be his going about and all his other concerns, applied himself\r\nwell nigh altogether to the keeping good watch over his wife; nor\r\nwould he ever fall asleep, except he first felt her come into the bed;\r\nby reason whereof the lady suffered the utmost chagrin, for that on no\r\nwise might she avail to be with her Ruberto.\r\n\r\nHowever, after pondering many devices for finding a means to\r\nforegather with him and being to boot continually solicited thereof by\r\nhim, it presently occurred to her to do on this wise; to wit, having\r\nmany a time observed that Arriguccio tarried long to fall asleep, but\r\nafter slept very soundly, she determined to cause Ruberto come about\r\nmidnight to the door of the house and to go open to him and abide with\r\nhim what while her husband slept fast. And that she might know when he\r\nshould be come, she bethought herself to hang a twine out of the\r\nwindow of her bedchamber, which looked upon the street, on such wise\r\nthat none might perceive it, one end whereof should well nigh reach\r\nthe ground, whilst she carried the other end along the floor of the\r\nroom to the bed and hid it under the clothes, meaning to make it fast\r\nto her great toe, whenas she should be abed. Accordingly, she sent to\r\nacquaint Ruberto with this and charged him, when he came, to pull the\r\ntwine, whereupon, if her husband slept, she would let it go and come\r\nto open to him; but, if he slept not, she would hold it fast and draw\r\nit to herself, so he should not wait. The device pleased Ruberto and\r\ngoing thither frequently, he was whiles able to foregather with her\r\nand whiles not.\r\n\r\nOn this wise they continued to do till, one night, the lady being\r\nasleep, it chanced that her husband stretched out his foot in bed and\r\nfelt the twine, whereupon he put his hand to it and finding it made\r\nfast to his wife's toe, said in himself, 'This should be some trick';\r\nand presently perceiving that the twine led out of window, he held it\r\nfor certain. Accordingly, he cut it softly from the lady's toe and\r\nmaking it fast to his own, abode on the watch to see what this might\r\nmean. He had not waited long before up came Ruberto and pulled at the\r\ntwine, as of his wont; whereupon Arriguccio started up; but, he not\r\nhaving made the twine well fast to his toe and Ruberto pulling hard,\r\nit came loose in the latter's hand, whereby he understood that he was\r\nto wait and did so. As for Arriguccio, he arose in haste and taking\r\nhis arms, ran to the door, to see who this might be and do him a\r\nmischief, for, albeit a merchant, he was a stout fellow and a strong.\r\nWhen he came to the door, he opened it not softly as the lady was used\r\nto do, which when Ruberto, who was await, observed, he guessed how the\r\ncase stood, to wit, that it was Arriguccio who opened the door, and\r\naccordingly made off in haste and the other after him. At last, having\r\nfled a great way and Arriguccio stinting not from following him,\r\nRuberto, being also armed, drew his sword and turned upon his pursuer,\r\nwhereupon they fell to blows, the one attacking and the other\r\ndefending himself.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the lady, awaking, as Arriguccio opened the chamber-door,\r\nand finding the twine cut from her toe, knew incontinent that her\r\ndevice was discovered, whereupon, perceiving that her husband had run\r\nafter her lover, she arose in haste and foreseeing what might happen,\r\ncalled her maid, who knew all, and conjured her to such purpose that\r\nshe prevailed with her to take her own place in the bed, beseeching\r\nher patiently to endure, without discovering herself, whatsoever\r\nbuffets Arriguccio might deal her, for that she would requite her\r\ntherefor on such wise that she should have no cause to complain; after\r\nwhich she did out the light that burnt in the chamber and going forth\r\nthereof, hid herself in another part of the house and there began to\r\nawait what should betide.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the people of the quarter, aroused by the noise of the\r\naffray between Arriguccio and Ruberto, arose and fell a-railing at\r\nthem; whereupon the husband, fearing to be known, let the youth go,\r\nwithout having availed to learn who he was or to do him any hurt, and\r\nreturned to his house, full of rage and despite. There, coming into\r\nthe chamber, he cried out angrily, saying, 'Where art thou, vile\r\nwoman? Thou hast done out the light, so I may not find thee; but thou\r\nart mistaken.' Then, coming to the bedside, he seized upon the maid,\r\nthinking to take his wife, and laid on to her so lustily with cuffs\r\nand kicks, as long as he could wag his hands and feet, that he bruised\r\nall her face, ending by cutting off her hair, still giving her the\r\nwhile the hardest words that were ever said to worthless woman. The\r\nmaid wept sore, as indeed she had good cause to do, and albeit she\r\nsaid whiles, 'Alas, mercy, for God's sake!' and 'Oh, no more!' her\r\nvoice was so broken with sobs and Arriguccio was so hindered with his\r\nrage that he never discerned it to be that of another woman than his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nHaving, then, as we have said, beaten her to good purpose and cut off\r\nher hair, he said to her, 'Wicked woman that thou art, I mean not to\r\ntouch thee otherwise, but shall now go fetch thy brothers and acquaint\r\nthem with thy fine doings and after bid them come for thee and deal\r\nwith thee as they shall deem may do them honour and carry thee away;\r\nfor assuredly in this house thou shalt abide no longer.' So saying, he\r\ndeparted the chamber and locking the door from without, went away all\r\nalone. As soon as Madam Sismonda, who had heard all, was certified of\r\nher husband's departure, she opened the door and rekindling the light,\r\nfound her maid all bruised and weeping sore; whereupon she comforted\r\nher as best she might and carried her back to her own chamber, where\r\nshe after caused privily tend her and care for her and so rewarded her\r\nof Arriguccio's own monies that she avouched herself content. No\r\nsooner had she done this than she hastened to make the bed in her own\r\nchamber and all restablished it and set it in such order as if none\r\nhad lain there that night; after which she dressed and tired herself,\r\nas if she had not yet gone to bed; then, lighting a lamp, she took her\r\nclothes and seated herself at the stairhead, where she proceeded to\r\nsew and await the issue of the affair.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Arriguccio betook himself in all haste to the house of his\r\nwife's brothers and there knocked so long and so loudly that he was\r\nheard and it was opened to him. The lady's three brothers and her\r\nmother, hearing that it was Arriguccio, rose all and letting kindle\r\nlights, came to him and asked what he went seeking at that hour and\r\nalone. Whereupon, beginning from the twine he had found tied to wife's\r\ntoe, he recounted to them all that he had discovered and done, and to\r\ngive them entire proof of the truth of his story, he put into their\r\nhands the hair he thought to have cut from his wife's head, ending by\r\nrequiring them to come for her and do with her that which they should\r\njudge pertinent to their honour, for that he meant to keep her no\r\nlonger in his house. The lady's brothers, hearing this and holding it\r\nfor certain, were sore incensed against her and letting kindle\r\ntorches, set out to accompany Arriguccio to his house, meaning to do\r\nher a mischief; which their mother seeing, she followed after them,\r\nweeping and entreating now the one, now the other not to be in such\r\nhaste to believe these things of their sister, without seeing or\r\nknowing more of the matter, for that her husband might have been\r\nangered with her for some other cause and have maltreated her and\r\nmight now allege this in his own excuse, adding that she marvelled\r\nexceedingly how this [whereof he accused her] could have happened, for\r\nthat she knew her daughter well, as having reared her from a little\r\nchild, with many other words to the like purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to Arriguccio's house, they entered and proceeded to\r\nmount the stair, whereupon Madam Sismonda, hearing them come, said,\r\n'Who is there?' To which one of her brothers answered, 'Thou shalt\r\nsoon know who it is, vile woman that thou art!' 'God aid us!' cried\r\nshe. 'What meaneth this?' Then, rising to her feet, 'Brothers mine,'\r\nquoth she, 'you are welcome; but what go you all three seeking at this\r\nhour?' The brothers,--seeing her seated sewing, with no sign of\r\nbeating on her face, whereas Arriguccio avouched that he had beaten\r\nher to a mummy,--began to marvel and curbing the violence of their\r\nanger, demanded of her how that had been whereof Arriguccio accused\r\nher, threatening her sore, and she told them not all. Quoth she, 'I\r\nknow not what you would have me say nor of what Arriguccio can have\r\ncomplained to you of me.' Arriguccio, seeing her thus, eyed her as if\r\nhe had lost his wits, remembering that he had dealt her belike a\r\nthousand buffets on the face and scratched her and done her all the\r\nill in the world, and now he beheld her as if nothing of all this had\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nHer brothers told her briefly what they had heard from Arriguccio,\r\ntwine and beating and all, whereupon she turned to him and said,\r\n'Alack, husband mine, what is this I hear? Why wilt thou make me pass,\r\nto thine own great shame, for an ill woman, where as I am none, and\r\nthyself for a cruel and wicked man, which thou art not? When wast thou\r\nin this house to-night till now, let alone with me? When didst thou\r\nbeat me? For my part, I have no remembrance of it.' 'How, vile woman\r\nthat thou art!' cried he. 'Did we not go to bed together here? Did I\r\nnot return hither, after running after thy lover? Did I not deal thee\r\na thousand buffets and cut off thy hair?' 'Thou wentest not to bed in\r\nthis house to-night,' replied Sismonda. 'But let that pass, for I can\r\ngive no proof thereof other than mine own true words, and let us come\r\nto that which thou sayest, to wit, that thou didst beat me and cut off\r\nmy hair. Me thou hast never beaten, and do all who are here and thou\r\nthyself take note of me, if I have any mark of beating in any part of\r\nmy person. Indeed, I should not counsel thee make so bold as to lay a\r\nhand on me, for, by Christ His Cross, I would mar thy face for thee!\r\nNeither didst thou cut off my hair, for aught that I felt or saw; but\r\nhaply thou didst it on such wise that I perceived it not; let me see\r\nif I have it shorn or no.' Then, putting off her veil from her head,\r\nshe showed that she had her hair unshorn and whole.\r\n\r\nHer mother and brothers, seeing and hearing all this, turned upon her\r\nhusband and said to him, 'What meanest thou, Arriguccio? This is not\r\nthat so far which thou camest to tell us thou hadst done, and we know\r\nnot how thou wilt make good the rest.' Arriguccio stood as one in a\r\ntrance and would have spoken; but, seeing that it was not as he\r\nthought he could show, he dared say nothing; whereupon the lady,\r\nturning to her brothers, said to them, 'Brothers mine, I see he hath\r\ngone seeking to have me do what I have never yet chosen to do, to wit,\r\nthat I should acquaint you with his lewdness and his vile fashions,\r\nand I will do it. I firmly believe that this he hath told you hath\r\nverily befallen him and that he hath done as he saith; and you shall\r\nhear how. This worthy man, to whom in an ill hour for me you gave me\r\nto wife, who calleth himself a merchant and would be thought a man of\r\ncredit, this fellow, forsooth, who should be more temperate than a\r\nmonk and chaster than a maid, there be few nights but he goeth\r\nfuddling himself about the taverns, foregathering now with this lewd\r\nwoman and now with that and keeping me waiting for him, on such wise\r\nas you find me, half the night and whiles even till morning. I doubt\r\nnot but that, having well drunken, he went to bed with some trull of\r\nhis and waking, found the twine on her foot and after did all these\r\nhis fine feats whereof he telleth, winding up by returning to her and\r\nbeating her and cutting off her hair; and not being yet well come to\r\nhimself, he fancied (and I doubt not yet fancieth) that he did all\r\nthis to me; and if you look him well in the face, you will see he is\r\nyet half fuddled. Algates, whatsoever he may have said of me, I will\r\nnot have you take it to yourselves except as a drunken man's talk, and\r\nsince I forgive him, do you also pardon him.'\r\n\r\nHer mother, hearing this, began to make an outcry and say, 'By Christ\r\nHis Cross, daughter mine, it shall not pass thus! Nay, he should\r\nrather be slain for a thankless, ill-conditioned dog, who was never\r\nworthy to have a girl of thy fashion to wife. Marry, a fine thing,\r\nforsooth! He could have used thee no worse, had he picked thee up out\r\nof the dirt! Devil take him if thou shalt abide at the mercy of the\r\nspite of a paltry little merchant of asses' dung! They come to us out\r\nof their pigstyes in the country, clad in homespun frieze, with their\r\nbag-breeches and pen in arse, and as soon as they have gotten a leash\r\nof groats, they must e'en have the daughters of gentlemen and right\r\nladies to wife and bear arms and say, \"I am of such a family\" and\r\n\"Those of my house did thus and thus.\" Would God my sons had followed\r\nmy counsel in the matter, for that they might have stablished thee so\r\nworshipfully in the family of the Counts Guidi, with a crust of bread\r\nto thy dowry! But they must needs give thee to this fine jewel of\r\nfellow, who, whereas thou art the best girl in Florence and the\r\nmodestest, is not ashamed to knock us up in the middle of the night,\r\nto tell us that thou art a strumpet, as if we knew thee not. But, by\r\nGod His faith, an they would be ruled by me, he should get such a\r\ntrouncing therefor that he should stink for it!' Then, turning to the\r\nlady's brothers, 'My sons,' said she, 'I told you this could not be.\r\nHave you heard how your fine brother-in-law here entreateth your\r\nsister? Four-farthing[353] huckster that he is! Were I in your shoes,\r\nhe having said what he hath of her and doing that which he doth, I\r\nwould never hold myself content nor appeased till I had rid the earth\r\nof him; and were I a man, as I am a woman, I would trouble none other\r\nthan myself to despatch his business. Confound him for a sorry drunken\r\nbeast, that hath no shame!'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 353: Or, in modern parlance, \"twopennny-halfpenny.\"]\r\n\r\nThe young men, seeing and hearing all this, turned upon Arriguccio and\r\ngave him the soundest rating ever losel got; and ultimately they said\r\nto him. 'We pardon thee this as to a drunken man; but, as thou\r\ntenderest thy life, look henceforward we hear no more news of this\r\nkind, for, if aught of the like come ever again to our ears, we will\r\npay thee at once for this and for that.' So saying, they went their\r\nways, leaving Arriguccio all aghast, as it were he had taken leave of\r\nhis wits, unknowing in himself whether that which he had done had\r\nreally been or whether he had dreamed it; wherefore he made no more\r\nwords thereof, but left his wife in peace. Thus the lady, by her ready\r\nwit, not only escaped the imminent peril [that threatened her,] but\r\nopened herself a way to do her every pleasure in time to come, without\r\nevermore having any fear of her husband.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NINTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Seventh]\r\n\r\n     LYDIA, WIFE OF NICOSTRATUS, LOVETH PYRRHUS, WHO, SO HE MAY\r\n     BELIEVE IT, REQUIRETH OF HER THREE THINGS, ALL WHICH SHE\r\n     DOTH. MOREOVER, SHE SOLACETH HERSELF WITH HIM IN THE\r\n     PRESENCE OF NICOSTRATUS AND MAKETH THE LATTER BELIEVE THAT\r\n     THAT WHICH HE HATH SEEN IS NOT REAL\r\n\r\n\r\nNeifile's story so pleased the ladies that they could neither give\r\nover to laugh at nor to talk of it, albeit the king, having bidden\r\nPamfilo tell his story, had several times imposed silence upon them.\r\nHowever, after they had held their peace, Pamfilo began thus: \"I do\r\nnot believe, worshipful ladies, that there is anything, how hard and\r\ndoubtful soever it be, that whoso loveth passionately will not dare to\r\ndo; the which, albeit it hath already been demonstrated in many\r\nstories, methinketh, nevertheless, I shall be able yet more plainly to\r\nshow forth to you in one which I purpose to tell you and wherein you\r\nshall hear of a lady, who was in her actions much more favoured of\r\nfortune than well-advised of reason; wherefore I would not counsel any\r\none to adventure herself in the footsteps of her of whom I am to tell,\r\nfor that fortune is not always well disposed nor are all men in the\r\nworld equally blind.\r\n\r\nIn Argos, city of Achia far more famous for its kings of past time\r\nthan great in itself, there was once a nobleman called Nicostratus, to\r\nwhom, when already neighbouring on old age, fortune awarded a lady of\r\ngreat family to wife, whose name was Lydia and who was no less\r\nhigh-spirited than fair. Nicostratus, like a nobleman and a man of\r\nwealth as he was, kept many servants and hounds and hawks and took the\r\nutmost delight in the chase. Among his other servants he had a young\r\nman called Pyrrhus, who was sprightly and well bred and comely of his\r\nperson and adroit in all that he had a mind to do, and him he loved\r\nand trusted over all else. Of this Pyrrhus Lydia became so sore\r\nenamoured that neither by day nor by night could she have her thought\r\notherwhere than with him; but he, whether it was that he perceived not\r\nher liking for him or that he would none of it, appeared to reck\r\nnothing thereof, by reason whereof the lady suffered intolerable\r\nchagrin in herself and being altogether resolved to give him to know\r\nof her passion, called a chamberwoman of hers, Lusca by name, in whom\r\nshe much trusted, and said to her, 'Lusca, the favours thou hast had\r\nof me should make thee faithful and obedient; wherefore look thou none\r\never know that which I shall presently say to thee, save he to whom I\r\nshall charge thee tell it. As thou seest, Lusca, I am a young and\r\nlusty lady, abundantly endowed with all those things which any woman\r\ncan desire; in brief, I can complain of but one thing, to wit, that my\r\nhusband's years are overmany, an they be measured by mine own,\r\nwherefore I fare but ill in the matter of that thing wherein young\r\nwomen take most pleasure, and none the less desiring it, as other\r\nwomen do, I have this long while determined in myself, since fortune\r\nhath been thus little my friend in giving me so old a husband, that I\r\nwill not be so much mine own enemy as not to contrive to find means\r\nfor my pleasures and my weal; which that I may have as complete in\r\nthis as in other things, I have bethought myself to will that our\r\nPyrrhus, as being worthier thereof than any other, should furnish them\r\nwith his embracements; nay, I have vowed him so great a love that I\r\nnever feel myself at ease save whenas I see him or think of him, and\r\nexcept I foregather with him without delay, methinketh I shall\r\ncertainly die thereof. Wherefore, if my life be dear to thee, thou\r\nwilt, on such wise as shall seem best to thee, signify to him any love\r\nand beseech him, on my part, to be pleased to come to me, whenas thou\r\nshalt go for him.'\r\n\r\nThe chamberwoman replied that she would well and taking Pyrrhus apart,\r\nwhenas first it seemed to her time and place, she did her lady's\r\nerrand to him as best she knew. Pyrrhus, hearing this, was sore amazed\r\nthereat, as one who had never anywise perceived aught of the matter,\r\nand misdoubted him the lady had let say this to him to try him;\r\nwherefore he answered roughly and hastily, 'Lusca, I cannot believe\r\nthat these words come from my lady; wherefore, have a care what thou\r\nsayst; or, if they do indeed come from her, I do not believe that she\r\ncaused thee say them with intent, and even if she did so, my lord doth\r\nme more honour than I deserve and I would not for my life do him such\r\nan outrage; wherefore look thou bespeak me no more of such things.'\r\nLusca, nowise daunted by his austere speech, said to him, 'Pyrrhus, I\r\nwill e'en bespeak thee both of this and of everything else wherewithal\r\nmy lady shall charge me when and as often as she shall bid me, whether\r\nit cause thee pleasure or annoy; but thou art an ass.' Then, somewhat\r\ndespited at his words, she returned to her mistress, who, hearing what\r\nPyrrhus had said, wished for death, but, some days after, she again\r\nbespoke the chamberwoman of the matter and said to her, 'Lusca, thou\r\nknowest that the oak falleth not for the first stroke; wherefore\r\nmeseemeth well that thou return anew to him who so strangely willeth\r\nto abide loyal to my prejudice, and taking a sortable occasion,\r\nthroughly discover to him my passion and do thine every endeavour that\r\nthe thing may have effect; for that, an it fall through thus, I shall\r\nassuredly die of it. Moreover, he will think to have been befooled,\r\nand whereas we seek to have his love, hate will ensue thereof.'\r\n\r\nThe maid comforted her and going in quest of Pyrrhus found him merry\r\nand well-disposed and said to him, 'Pyrrhus I showed thee, a few days\r\nagone, in what a fire my lady and thine abideth for the love she\r\nbeareth thee, and now anew I certify thee thereof, for that, an thou\r\npersist in the rigour thou showedst the other day, thou mayst be\r\nassured that she will not live long; wherefore I prithee be pleased to\r\nsatisfy her of her desire, and if thou yet abide fast in thine\r\nobstinacy, whereas I have still accounted thee mighty discreet, I\r\nshall hold thee a blockhead. What can be a greater glory for thee than\r\nthat such a lady, so fair and so noble, should love thee over all\r\nelse? Besides, how greatly shouldst thou acknowledge thyself beholden\r\nunto Fortune, seeing that she proffereth thee a thing of such worth\r\nand so conformable to the desires of thy youth and to boot, such a\r\nresource for thy necessities! Which of thy peers knowest thou who\r\nfareth better by way of delight than thou mayst fare, an thou be wise?\r\nWhat other couldst thou find who may fare so well in the matter of\r\narms and horses and apparel and monies as thou mayst do, so thou wilt\r\nbut vouchsafe thy love to this lady? Open, then, thy mind to my words\r\nand return to thy senses; bethink thee that once, and no oftener, it\r\nis wont to betide that fortune cometh unto a man with smiling face and\r\nopen arms, who an he know not then to welcome, if after he find\r\nhimself poor and beggarly, he hath himself and not her to blame.\r\nBesides, there is no call to use that loyalty between servants and\r\nmasters that behoveth between friends and kinsfolk; nay, servants\r\nshould use their masters, in so far as they may, like as themselves\r\nare used of them. Thinkest thou, an thou hadst a fair wife or mother\r\nor daughter or sister, who pleased Nicostratus, that he would go\r\nquesting after this loyalty that thou wouldst fain observe towards him\r\nin respect of this lady? Thou are a fool, if thou think thus; for thou\r\nmayst hold it for certain that, if blandishments and prayers sufficed\r\nhim not, he would not scruple to use force in the matter, whatsoever\r\nthou mightest deem thereof. Let us, then, entreat them and their\r\naffairs even as they entreat us and ours. Profit by the favour of\r\nfortune and drive her not away, but welcome her with open arms and\r\nmeet her halfway, for assuredly, and thou do it not, thou wilt yet\r\n(leave alone the death that will without fail ensue thereof to thy\r\nlady) repent thee thereof so many a time thou wilt be fain to die\r\ntherefor.'\r\n\r\nPyrrhus, who had again and again pondered the words that Lusca had\r\nsaid to him, had determined, and she should return to him, to make her\r\nanother guess answer and altogether to submit himself to comply with\r\nthe lady's wishes, so but he might be certified that it was not a\r\ntrick to try him, and accordingly answered, 'Harkye, Lusca; all that\r\nthou sayst to me I allow to be true; but, on the other hand, I know my\r\nlord for very discreet and well-advised, and as he committeth all his\r\naffairs to my hands, I am sore adread lest Lydia, with his counsel and\r\nby his wish, do this to try me; wherefore, an it please her for mine\r\nassurance do three things that I shall ask, she shall for certain\r\nthereafterward command me nought but I will do it forthright. And the\r\nthree things I desire are these: first, that in Nicostratus his\r\npresence she slay his good hawk; secondly, that she send me a lock of\r\nher husband's beard and lastly, one of his best teeth.' These\r\nconditions seemed hard unto Lusca and to the lady harder yet;\r\nhowever, Love, who is an excellent comforter[354] and a past master in\r\nshifts and devices, made her resolve to do his pleasure and\r\naccordingly she sent him word by her chamberwoman that she would\r\npunctually do what he required and that quickly, and that over and\r\nabove this, for that he deemed Nicostratus so well-advised, she would\r\nsolace herself with him in her husband's presence and make the latter\r\nbelieve that it was not true.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 354: Syn. encourager, helper, auxiliary (_confortatore_).]\r\n\r\nPyrrhus, accordingly, began to await what the lady should do, and\r\nNicostratus having, a few days after, made, as he oftentimes used to\r\ndo, a great dinner to certain gentlemen, Madam Lydia, whenas the\r\ntables were cleared away, came forth of her chamber, clad in green\r\nsamite and richly bedecked, and entered the saloon where the guests\r\nwere. There, in the sight of Pyrrhus and of all the rest, she went up\r\nto the perch, whereon was the hawk that Nicostratus held so dear, and\r\ncast it loose, as she would set it on her hand; then, taking it by the\r\njesses, she dashed it against the wall and killed it; whereupon\r\nNicostratus cried out at her, saying, 'Alack, wife, what hast thou\r\ndone?' She answered him nothing, but, turning to the gentlemen who had\r\neaten with him, she said to them, 'Gentlemen, I should ill know how to\r\navenge myself on a king who did me a despite, an I dared not take my\r\nwreak of a hawk. You must know that this bird hath long robbed me of\r\nall the time which should of men be accorded to the pleasuring of the\r\nladies; for that no sooner is the day risen than Nicostratus is up and\r\ndrest and away he goeth a-horseback, with his hawk on his fist, to the\r\nopen plains, to see him fly, whilst I, such as you see me, abide in\r\nbed alone and ill-content; wherefore I have many a time had a mind to\r\ndo that which I have now done, nor hath aught hindered me therefrom\r\nbut that I waited to do it in the presence of gentlemen who would be\r\njust judges in my quarrel, as methinketh you will be.' The gentlemen,\r\nhearing this and believing her affection for Nicostratus to be no\r\notherwise than as her words denoted, turned all to the latter, who was\r\nangered, and said, laughing, 'Ecod, how well hath the lady done to\r\navenge herself of her wrong by the death of the hawk!' Then, with\r\ndivers of pleasantries upon the subject (the lady being now gone back\r\nto her chamber), they turned Nicostratus his annoy into laughter;\r\nwhilst Pyrrhus, seeing all this, said in himself, 'The lady hath given\r\na noble beginning to my happy loves; God grant she persevere!'\r\n\r\nLydia having thus slain the hawk, not many days were passed when,\r\nbeing in her chamber with Nicostratus, she fell to toying and\r\nfrolicking with him, and he, pulling her somedele by the hair, by way\r\nof sport, gave her occasion to accomplish the second thing required of\r\nher by Pyrrhus. Accordingly, taking him of a sudden by a lock of his\r\nbeard, she tugged so hard at it, laughing the while, that she plucked\r\nit clean out of his chin; whereof he complaining, 'How now?' quoth\r\nshe. 'What aileth thee to pull such a face? Is it because I have\r\nplucked out maybe half a dozen hairs of thy beard? Thou feltest not\r\nthat which I suffered, whenas thou pulledst me now by the hair.' On\r\nthis wise continuing their disport from one word to another, she\r\nprivily kept the lock of hair that she had plucked from his beard and\r\nsent it that same day to her lover.\r\n\r\nAnent the last of the three things required by Pyrrhus she was harder\r\nput to it for a device; nevertheless, being of a surpassing wit and\r\nLove making her yet quicker of invention, she soon bethought herself\r\nwhat means she should use to give it accomplishment. Nicostratus had\r\ntwo boys given him of their father, to the intent that, being of\r\ngentle birth, they might learn somewhat of manners and good breeding\r\nin his house, of whom, whenas he was at meat, one carved before him\r\nand the other gave him to drink. Lydia called them both and giving\r\nthem to believe that they stank at the mouth, enjoined them that,\r\nwhenas they served Nicostratus, they should still hold their heads\r\nbackward as most they might nor ever tell this to any. The boys,\r\nbelieving that which she said, proceeded to do as she had lessoned\r\nthem, and she after a while said to her husband one day, 'Hast thou\r\nnoted that which yonder boys do, whenas they serve thee?' 'Ay have I,'\r\nreplied Nicostratus; 'and indeed I had it in mind to ask them why they\r\ndid it.' Quoth the lady, 'Do it not, for I can tell thee the reason;\r\nand I have kept it silent from thee this long while, not to cause thee\r\nannoy; but, now I perceive that others begin to be aware thereof, it\r\nskilleth not to hide it from thee longer. This betideth thee for none\r\nother what than that thou stinkest terribly at the mouth, and I know\r\nnot what can be the cause thereof; for that it used not to be thus.\r\nNow this is a very unseemly thing for thee who hast to do with\r\ngentlemen, and needs must we see for a means of curing it.' Whereupon\r\nsaid he, 'What can this be? Can I have some rotten tooth in my head?'\r\n'Maybe ay,' answered Lydia and carried him to a window, where she made\r\nhim open his mouth, and after she had viewed it in every part, 'O\r\nNicostratus,' cried she, 'how canst thou have put up with it so long?\r\nThou hast a tooth on this side which meseemth is not only decayed, but\r\naltogether rotten, and assuredly, and thou keep it much longer in thy\r\nmouth, it will mar thee those which be on either side; wherefore I\r\ncounsel thee have it drawn, ere the thing go farther.' 'Since it\r\nseemeth good to thee,' answered he, 'I will well; let a surgeon be\r\nsent for without more delay, who shall draw it for me.' 'God forbid,'\r\nrejoined the lady, 'that a surgeon come hither for that! Methinketh it\r\nlieth on such wise that I myself, without any surgeon, can very well\r\ndraw it for thee; more by token that these same surgeons are so\r\nbarbarous in doing such offices that my heart would on no account\r\nsuffer me to see or know thee in the hands of any one of them; for, an\r\nit irk thee overmuch, I will at least loose thee incontinent, which a\r\nsurgeon would not do.'\r\n\r\nAccordingly, she let fetch the proper instruments and sent every one\r\nforth of the chamber, except only Lusca; after which, locking herself\r\nin, she made Nicostratus lie down on a table and thrusting the pincers\r\ninto his mouth, what while the maid held him fast, she pulled out one\r\nof his teeth by main force, albeit he roared out lustily for the pain.\r\nThen, keeping to herself that which she had drawn, she brought out a\r\nfrightfully decayed tooth she had ready in her hand and showed it to\r\nher husband, half dead as he was for pain, saying, 'See what thou\r\nhast had in thy mouth all this while.' Nicostratus believed what she\r\nsaid and now that the tooth was out, for all he had suffered the most\r\ngrievous pain and made sore complaint thereof, him seemed he was\r\ncured; and presently, having comforted himself with one thing and\r\nanother and the pain being abated, he went forth of the chamber;\r\nwhereupon his wife took the tooth and straightway despatched it to her\r\ngallant, who, being now certified of her love, professed himself ready\r\nto do her every pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe lady, albeit every hour seemed to her a thousand till she should\r\nbe with him, desiring to give him farther assurance and wishful to\r\nperform that which she had promised him, made a show one day of being\r\nailing and being visited after dinner by Nicostratus, with no one in\r\nhis company but Pyrrhus, she prayed them, by way of allaying her\r\nunease, to help her go into the garden. Accordingly, Nicostratus\r\ntaking her on one side and Pyrrhus on the other, they carried her into\r\nthe garden and set her down on a grassplot, at the foot of a fine\r\npear-tree; where, after they had sat awhile, the lady, who had already\r\ngiven her gallant to know what he had to do, said, 'Pyrrhus, I have a\r\ngreat desire to eat of yonder pears; do thou climb up and throw us\r\ndown some of them.' Pyrrhus straightway climbed up into the tree and\r\nfell to throwing down of the pears, which as he did, he began to say,\r\n'How now, my lord! What is this you do? And you, madam, are you not\r\nashamed to suffer it in my presence? Think you I am blind? But now you\r\nwere sore disordered; how cometh it you have so quickly recovered that\r\nyou do such things? An you have a mind unto this, you have store of\r\ngoodly chambers; why go you not do it in one of these? It were more\r\nseemly than in my presence.'\r\n\r\nThe lady turned to her husband and said, 'What saith Pyrrhus? Doth he\r\nrave?' 'No, madam,' answered the young man, 'I rave not. Think you I\r\ncannot see?' As for Nicostratus, he marvelled sore and said, 'Verily,\r\nPyrrhus, methinketh thou dreamest.' 'My lord,' replied Pyrrhus, 'I\r\ndream not a jot, neither do you dream; nay, you bestir yourselves on\r\nsuch wise that were this tree to do likewise, there would not be a\r\npear left on it.' Quoth the lady, 'What may this be? Can it be that\r\nthis he saith appeareth to him to be true? So God save me, and I were\r\nwhole as I was aforetime, I would climb up into the tree, to see what\r\nmarvels are those which this fellow saith he seeth.' Meanwhile Pyrrhus\r\nfrom the top of the pear-tree still said the same thing and kept up\r\nthe pretence; whereupon Nicostratus bade him come down. Accordingly he\r\ncame down and his master said to him, 'Now, what sayst thou thou\r\nsawest?' 'Methinketh,' answered he, 'you take me for a lackwit or a\r\nloggerhead. Since I must needs say it, I saw you a-top of your lady,\r\nand after, as I came down, I saw you arise and seat yourself where you\r\npresently are.' 'Assuredly,' said Nicostratus, 'thou dotest; for we\r\nhave not stirred a jot, save as thou seest, since thou climbest up\r\ninto the pear-tree.' Whereupon quoth Pyrrhus, 'What booteth it to make\r\nwords of the matter? I certainly saw you; and if I did see you, it was\r\na-top of your own.'\r\n\r\nNicostratus waxed momently more and more astonished, insomuch that he\r\nsaid, 'Needs must I see if this pear-tree is enchanted and if whoso is\r\nthereon seeth marvels.' Thereupon he climbed up into the tree and no\r\nsooner was he come to the top than the lady and Pyrrhus fell to\r\nsolacing themselves together; which when Nicostratus saw, he began to\r\ncry out, saying, 'Ah, vile woman that thou art, what is this thou\r\ndost? And thou, Pyrrhus, in whom I most trusted?' So saying, he\r\nproceeded to descend the tree, whilst the lovers said, 'We are sitting\r\nhere'; then, seeing him come down, they reseated themselves whereas he\r\nhad left them. As soon as he was down and saw his wife and Pyrrhus\r\nwhere he had left them, he fell a-railing at them; whereupon quoth\r\nPyrrhus, 'Now, verily, Nicostratus, I acknowledged that, as you said\r\nbefore, I must have seen falsely what while I was in the pear-tree,\r\nnor do I know it otherwise than by this, that I see and know yourself\r\nto have seen falsely in the like case. And that I speak the truth\r\nnought else should be needful to certify you but that you have regard\r\nto the circumstances of the case and consider if it be possible that\r\nyour lady, who is the most virtuous of women and discreeter than any\r\nother of her sex, could, an she had a mind to outrage you on such\r\nwise, bring herself to do it before your very eyes. I speak not of\r\nmyself, who would rather suffer myself to be torn limb-meal than so\r\nmuch as think of such a thing, much more come to do it in your\r\npresence. Wherefore the fault of this misseeing must needs proceed\r\nfrom the pear-tree, for that all the world had not made me believe but\r\nthat you were in act to have carnal knowledge of your lady here, had I\r\nnot heard you say that it appeared to yourself that I did what I know\r\nmost certainly I never thought, much less did.'\r\n\r\nThereupon the lady, feigning to be mightily incensed, rose to her feet\r\nand said, 'Ill luck betide thee, dost thou hold me so little of wit\r\nthat, an I had a mind to such filthy fashions as thou wouldst have us\r\nbelieve thou sawest, I should come to do them before thy very eyes?\r\nThou mayst be assured of this that, if ever the fancy took me thereof,\r\nI should not come hither; marry, methinketh I should have sense enough\r\nto contrive it in one of our chambers, on such wise and after such a\r\nfashion that it would seem to me an extraordinary thing if ever thou\r\ncamest to know of it.' Nicostratus, himseeming that what the lady and\r\nPyrrhus said was true, to wit, that they would never have ventured\r\nupon such an act there before himself, gave over words and reproaches\r\nand fell to discoursing of the strangeness of the fact and the miracle\r\nof the sight, which was thus changed unto whoso climbed up into the\r\npear-tree. But his wife, feigning herself chagrined for the ill\r\nthought he had shown of her, said, 'Verily, this pear-tree shall never\r\nagain, if I can help it, do me nor any other lady the like of this\r\nshame; wherefore do thou run, Pyrrhus, and fetch a hatchet and at one\r\nstroke avenge both thyself and me by cutting it down; albeit it were\r\nbetter yet lay it about Nicostratus his cosard, who, without any\r\nconsideration, suffered the eyes of his understanding to be so quickly\r\nblinded, whenas, however certain that which thou[355] saidst might\r\nseem to those[356] which thou hast in thy head, thou shouldst for\r\nnought in the world in the judgment of thy mind have believed or\r\nallowed that such a thing could be.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 355: This sudden change from the third to the second person,\r\nin speaking of Nicostratus, is a characteristic example of Boccaccio's\r\nconstant abuse of the figure enallage in his dialogues.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 356: _i.e._ those eyes.]\r\n\r\nPyrrhus very readily fetched the hatchet and cut down the tree, which\r\nwhen the lady saw fallen, she said to Nicostratus, 'Since I see the\r\nenemy of mine honour overthrown, my anger is past,' and graciously\r\nforgave her husband, who besought her thereof, charging him that it\r\nshould never again happen to him to presume such a thing of her, who\r\nloved him better than herself. Accordingly, the wretched husband, thus\r\nbefooled, returned with her and her lover to the palace, where many a\r\ntime thereafterward Pyrrhus took delight and pleasance more at ease of\r\nLydia and she of him. God grant us as much!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TENTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Seventh]\r\n\r\n     TWO SIENNESE LOVE A LADY, WHO IS GOSSIP TO ONE OF THEM; THE\r\n     LATTER DIETH AND RETURNING TO HIS COMPANION, ACCORDING TO\r\n     PROMISE MADE HIM, RELATETH TO HIM HOW FOLK FARE IN THE OTHER\r\n     WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nIt now rested only with the king to tell and he accordingly, as soon\r\nas he saw the ladies quieted, who lamented the cutting down of the\r\nunoffending pear-tree, began, \"It is a very manifest thing that every\r\njust king should be the first to observe the laws made by him, and an\r\nhe do otherwise, he must be adjudged a slave deserving of punishment\r\nand not a king, into which offence and under which reproach I, who am\r\nyour king, am in a manner constrained to fall. True it is that\r\nyesterday I laid down the law for to-day's discourses, purposing not\r\nthis day to make use of my privilege, but, submitting myself to the\r\nsame obligation as you, to discourse of that whereof you have all\r\ndiscoursed. However, not only hath that story been told which I had\r\nthought to tell, but so many other and far finer things have been said\r\nupon the matter that, for my part, ransack my memory as I will, I can\r\ncall nothing to mind and must avouch myself unable to say aught anent\r\nsuch a subject that may compare with those stories which have already\r\nbeen told. Wherefore, it behoving me transgress against the law made\r\nby myself, I declare myself in advance ready, as one deserving of\r\npunishment, to submit to any forfeit which may be imposed on me, and\r\nso have recourse to my wonted privilege. Accordingly, dearest ladies,\r\nI say that Elisa's story of Fra Rinaldo and his gossip and eke the\r\nsimplicity of the Siennese have such efficacy that they induce me,\r\nletting be the cheats put upon foolish husbands by their wily wives,\r\nto tell you a slight story of them,[357] which though it have in it no\r\nlittle of that which must not be believed, will natheless in part, at\r\nleast, be pleasing to hear.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 357: _i.e._ the Siennese.]\r\n\r\nThere were, then, in Siena two young men of the people, whereof one\r\nwas called Tingoccio Mini and the other Meuccio di Tura; they abode at\r\nPorta Salaja and consorted well nigh never save one with the other. To\r\nall appearance they loved each exceedingly and resorting, as men do,\r\nto churches and preachings, they had many a time heard tell of the\r\nhappiness and of the misery that are, according to their deserts,\r\nallotted in the next world to the souls of those who die; of which\r\nthings desiring to have certain news and finding no way thereto, they\r\npromised one another that whichever of them died first should, an he\r\nmight, return to him who abode on life and give him tidings of that\r\nwhich he would fain know; and this they confirmed with an oath. Having\r\ncome to this accord and companying still together, as hath been said,\r\nit chanced that Tingoccio became godfather to a child which one\r\nAmbruogio Anselmini, abiding at Campo Reggi, had had of his wife,\r\nMistress Mita by name, and from time to time visiting, together with\r\nMeuccio, his gossip who was a very fair and lovesome lady, he became,\r\nnotwithstanding the gossipship, enamoured of her. Meuccio, on like\r\nwise, hearing her mightily commended of his friend and being himself\r\nmuch pleased with her, fell in love with her, and each hid his love\r\nfrom the other, but not for one same reason. Tingoccio was careful not\r\nto discover it to Meuccio, on account of the naughty deed which\r\nhimseemed he did to love his gossip and which he had been ashamed that\r\nany should know. Meuccio, on the other hand, kept himself\r\ntherefrom,[358] for that he had already perceived that the lady\r\npleased Tingoccio; whereupon he said in himself, 'If I discover this\r\nto him, he will wax jealous of me and being able, as her gossip, to\r\nbespeak her at his every pleasure, he will, inasmuch as he may, bring\r\nme in ill savour with her, and so I shall never have of her aught that\r\nmay please me.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 358: _i.e._ from discovering to his friend his liking for\r\nthe lady.]\r\n\r\nThings being at this pass, it befell that Tingoccio, having more\r\nleisure of discovering his every desire to the lady, contrived with\r\nacts and words so to do that he had his will of her, of which Meuccio\r\nsoon became aware and albeit it sore misliked him, yet, hoping some\r\ntime or other to compass his desire, he feigned ignorance thereof, so\r\nTingoccio might not have cause or occasion to do him an ill turn or\r\nhinder him in any of his affairs. The two friends loving thus, the one\r\nmore happily than the other, it befell that Tingoccio, finding the\r\nsoil of his gossip's demesne soft and eath to till, so delved and\r\nlaboured there that there overcame him thereof a malady, which after\r\nsome days waxed so heavy upon him that, being unable to brook it, he\r\ndeparted this life. The third day after his death (for that belike he\r\nhad not before been able) he came by night, according to the promise\r\nmade, into Meuccio's chamber and called the latter, who slept fast.\r\nMeuccio awoke and said, 'Who art thou?' Whereto he answered, 'I am\r\nTingoccio, who, according to the promise which I made thee, am come\r\nback to thee to give thee news of the other world.'\r\n\r\nMeuccio was somewhat affrighted at seeing him; nevertheless, taking\r\nheart, 'Thou art welcome, brother mine,' quoth he, and presently asked\r\nhim if he were lost. 'Things are lost that are not to be found,'\r\nreplied Tingoccio; 'and how should I be here, if I were lost?'\r\n'Alack,' cried Meuccio, 'I say not so; nay, I ask thee if thou art\r\namong the damned souls in the avenging fire of hell.' Whereto quoth\r\nTingoccio, 'As for that, no; but I am, notwithstanding, in very\r\ngrievous and anguishful torment for the sins committed by me.' Meuccio\r\nthen particularly enquired of him what punishments were awarded in the\r\nother world for each of the sins that folk use to commit here below,\r\nand he told him them all. After this Meuccio asked if there were aught\r\nhe might do for him in this world, whereto Tingoccio replied that\r\nthere was, to wit, that he should let say for him masses and orisons\r\nand do alms in his name, for that these things were mightily\r\nprofitable to those who abode yonder. Meuccio said that he would well\r\nand Tingoccio offering to take leave of him, he remembered himself of\r\nthe latter's amour with his gossip and raising his head, said, 'Now\r\nthat I bethink me, Tingoccio, what punishment is given thee over\r\nyonder anent thy gossip, with whom thou layest, whenas thou wast here\r\nbelow?' 'Brother mine,' answered Tingoccio, 'whenas I came yonder,\r\nthere was one who it seemed knew all my sins by heart and bade me\r\nbetake myself to a certain place, where I bemoaned my offences in\r\nexceeding sore punishment and where I found many companions condemned\r\nto the same penance as myself. Being among them and remembering me of\r\nthat which I had done whilere with my gossip, I looked for a much\r\nsorer punishment on account thereof than that which had presently been\r\ngiven me and went all shivering for fear, albeit I was in a great fire\r\nand an exceeding hot; which one who was by my side perceiving, he said\r\nto me, \"What aileth thee more than all the others who are here that\r\nthou shiverest, being in the fire?\" \"Marry,\" said I, \"my friend, I am\r\nsore in fear of the sentence I expect for a grievous sin I wrought\r\naforetime.\" The other asked me what sin this was, and I answered, \"It\r\nwas that I lay with a gossip of mine, and that with such a vengeance\r\nthat it cost me my life\"; whereupon quoth he, making merry over my\r\nfear, \"Go to, fool; have no fear. Here is no manner of account taken\r\nof gossips.\" Which when I heard, I was altogether reassured.' This\r\nsaid and the day drawing near, 'Meuccio,' quoth he, 'abide with God,\r\nfor I may no longer be with thee,' and was suddenly gone. Meuccio,\r\nhearing that no account was taken of gossips in the world to come,\r\nbegan to make mock of his own simplicity, for that whiles he had\r\nspared several of them; wherefore, laying by his ignorance, he became\r\nwiser in that respect for the future. Which things if Fra Rinaldo had\r\nknown, he had not needed to go a-syllogizing,[359] whenas he converted\r\nhis good gossip to his pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 359: Or, in modern parlance, logic-chopping\r\n(_sillogizzando_).]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nZephyr was now arisen, for the sun that drew near unto the setting,\r\nwhen the king, having made an end of his story and there being none\r\nother left to tell, put off the crown from his own head and set it on\r\nthat of Lauretta, saying, \"Madam, with yourself[360] I crown you\r\nqueen of our company; do you then, from this time forth, as sovereign\r\nlady, command that which you may deem shall be for the pleasure and\r\nsolacement of all.\" This said, he reseated himself, whereupon\r\nLauretta, become queen, let call the seneschal and bade him look that\r\nthe tables be set in the pleasant valley somewhat earlier than of\r\nwont, so they might return to the palace at their leisure; after which\r\nshe instructed him what he should do what while her sovranty lasted.\r\nThen, turning to the company, she said, \"Dioneo willed yesterday that\r\nwe should discourse to-day of the tricks that women play their\r\nhusbands and but that I am loath to show myself of the tribe of\r\nsnappish curs, which are fain incontinent to avenge themselves of any\r\naffront done them, I would say that to-morrow's discourse should be of\r\nthe tricks that men play their wives. But, letting that be, I ordain\r\nthat each bethink himself to tell OF THE TRICKS THAT ALL DAY LONG\r\nWOMEN PLAY MEN OR MEN WOMEN OR MEN ONE ANOTHER; and I doubt not but\r\nthat in this[361] there will be no less of pleasant discourse than\r\nthere hath been to-day.\" So saying, she rose to her feet and dismissed\r\nthe company till supper-time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 360: _i.e._ with that whereof you bear the name, _i.e._\r\nlaurel (_laurea_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 361: Or \"on this subject\" (_in questo_).]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they all, ladies and men alike, arose and some began to\r\ngo barefoot through the clear water, whilst others went a-pleasuring\r\nupon the greensward among the straight and goodly trees. Dioneo and\r\nFiammetta sang together a great while of Arcite and Palemon, and on\r\nthis wise, taking various and divers delights, they passed the time\r\nwith the utmost satisfaction until the hour of supper; which being\r\ncome, they seated themselves at table beside the lakelet and there, to\r\nthe song of a thousand birds, still refreshed by a gentle breeze, that\r\ncame from the little hills around, and untroubled of any fly, they\r\nsupped in peace and cheer. Then, the tables being removed and the sun\r\nbeing yet half-vespers[362] high, after they had gone awhile round\r\nabout the pleasant valley, they wended their way again, even as it\r\npleased their queen, with slow steps towards their wonted\r\ndwelling-place, and jesting and chattering a thousand things, as well\r\nof those whereof it had been that day discoursed as of others, they\r\ncame near upon nightfall to the fair palace, where having with the\r\ncoolest of wines and confections done away the fatigues of the little\r\njourney, they presently fell to dancing about the fair fountain,\r\ncarolling[363] now to the sound of Tindaro's bagpipe and anon to that\r\nof other instruments. But, after awhile, the queen bade Filomena sing\r\na song, whereupon she began thus:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 362: _Quære_, \"half-complines,\" _i.e._ half-past seven p.m.\r\n\"Half-vespers\" would be half-past four, which seems too early.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 363: _Carolando_, _i.e._ dancing in a round and singing the\r\nwhile, the original meaning of our word \"carol.\"]\r\n\r\n     Alack, my life forlorn!\r\n       Will't ever chance I may once more regain\r\n     Th' estate whence sorry fortune hath me torn?\r\n\r\n       Certes, I know not, such a wish of fire\r\n         I carry in my thought\r\n           To find me where, alas! I was whilere.\r\n       O dear my treasure, thou my sole desire,\r\n         That holdst my heart distraught.\r\n           Tell it me, thou; for whom I know nor dare\r\n           To ask it otherwhere.\r\n       Ah, dear my lord, oh, cause me hope again,\r\n     So I may comfort me my spright wayworn.\r\n\r\n       What was the charm I cannot rightly tell\r\n         That kindled in me such\r\n           A flame of love that rest nor day nor night\r\n       I find; for, by some strong unwonted spell,\r\n         Hearing and touch\r\n           And seeing each new fires in me did light,\r\n           Wherein I burn outright;\r\n       Nor other than thyself can soothe my pain\r\n     Nor call my senses back, by love o'erborne.\r\n\r\n       O tell me if and when, then, it shall be\r\n         That I shall find thee e'er\r\n           Whereas I kissed those eyes that did me slay.\r\n       O dear my good, my soul, ah, tell it me,\r\n         When thou wilt come back there,\r\n           And saying \"Quickly,\" comfort my dismay\r\n           Somedele. Short be the stay\r\n       Until thou come, and long mayst thou remain!\r\n     I'm so love-struck, I reck not of men's scorn.\r\n\r\n       If once again I chance to hold thee aye,\r\n         I will not be so fond\r\n           As erst I was to suffer thee to fly;\r\n       Nay, fast I'll hold thee, hap of it what may,\r\n         And having thee in bond,\r\n           Of thy sweet mouth my lust I'll satisfy.\r\n           Now of nought else will I\r\n       Discourse. Quick, to thy bosom come me strain;\r\n     The sheer thought bids me sing like lark at morn.\r\n\r\nThis song caused all the company conclude that a new and pleasing love\r\nheld Filomena in bonds, and as by the words it appeared that she had\r\ntasted more thereof than sight alone, she was envied of this by\r\ncertain who were there and who held her therefor so much the happier.\r\nBut, after her song was ended, the queen, remembering her that the\r\nensuing day was Friday, thus graciously bespoke all, \"You know, noble\r\nladies and you also, young men, that to-morrow is the day consecrated\r\nto the passion of our Lord, the which, an you remember aright, what\r\ntime Neifile was queen, we celebrated devoutly and therein gave pause\r\nto our delightsome discoursements, and on like wise we did with the\r\nfollowing Saturday. Wherefore, being minded to follow the good example\r\ngiven us by Neifile, I hold it seemly that to-morrow and the next day\r\nwe abstain, even as we did a week agone, from our pleasant\r\nstory-telling, recalling to memory that which on those days befell\r\nwhilere for the salvation of our souls.\" The queen's pious speech was\r\npleasing unto all and a good part of the night being now past, they\r\nall, dismissed by her, betook them to repose.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE ENDETH THE SEVENTH DAY\r\nOF THE DECAMERON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Day the Eighth_\r\n\r\n     HERE BEGINNETH THE EIGHTH DAY OF THE DECAMERON WHEREIN UNDER\r\n     THE GOVERNANCE OF LAURETTA IS DISCOURSED OF THE TRICKS THAT\r\n     ALL DAY LONG WOMEN PLAY MEN OR MEN WOMEN OR MEN ONE ANOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\nAlready on the Sunday morning the rays of the rising light appeared on\r\nthe summits of the higher mountains and every shadow having departed,\r\nthings might manifestly be discerned, when the queen, arising with her\r\ncompany, went wandering first through the dewy grass and after,\r\ntowards half-tierce,[364] visiting a little neighboring church, heard\r\nthere divine service; then, returning home, they ate with mirth and\r\njoyance and after sang and danced awhile till the queen dismissed\r\nthem, so whoso would might go rest himself. But, whenas the sun had\r\npassed the meridian, they all seated themselves, according as it\r\npleased the queen, near the fair fountain, for the wonted\r\nstory-telling, and Neifile, by her commandment, began thus:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 364: _i.e._ half-past seven a.m.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Eighth]\r\n\r\n     GULFARDO BORROWETH OF GUASPARRUOLO CERTAIN MONIES, FOR WHICH\r\n     HE HATH AGREED WITH HIS WIFE THAT HE SHALL LIE WITH HER, AND\r\n     ACCORDINGLY GIVETH THEM TO HER; THEN, IN HER PRESENCE, HE\r\n     TELLETH GUASPARRUOLO THAT HE GAVE THEM TO HER, AND SHE\r\n     CONFESSETH IT TO BE TRUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Since God hath so ordered it that I am to give a beginning to the\r\npresent day's discourses, with my story, I am content, and therefore,\r\nlovesome ladies, seeing that much hath been said of the tricks played\r\nby women upon men, it is my pleasure to relate one played by a man\r\nupon a woman, not that I mean therein to blame that which the man did\r\nor to deny that it served the woman aright, nay, rather to commend the\r\nman and blame the woman and to show that men also know how to cozen\r\nthose who put faith in them, even as themselves are cozened by those\r\nin whom they believe. Indeed, to speak more precisely, that whereof I\r\nhave to tell should not be called cozenage; nay, it should rather be\r\nstyled a just requital; for that, albeit a woman should still be\r\nvirtuous and guard her chastity as her life nor on any account suffer\r\nherself be persuaded to sully it, yet, seeing that, by reason of our\r\nfrailty, this is not always possible as fully as should be, I affirm\r\nthat she who consenteth to her own dishonour for a price is worthy of\r\nthe fire, whereas she who yieldeth for Love's sake, knowing his\r\nexceeding great puissance, meriteth forgiveness from a judge not too\r\nsevere, even as, a few days agone, Filostrato showed it to have been\r\nobserved towards Madam Filippa at Prato.\r\n\r\nThere was, then, aforetime at Milan a German, by name Gulfardo, in the\r\npay of the state, a stout fellow of his person and very loyal to those\r\nin whose service he engaged himself, which is seldom the case with\r\nGermans; and for that he was a very punctual repayer of such loans as\r\nwere made him, he might always find many merchants ready to lend him\r\nany quantity of money at little usance. During his sojourn in Milan,\r\nhe set his heart upon a very fair lady called Madam Ambruogia, the\r\nwife of a rich merchant, by name Guasparruolo Cagastraccio, who was\r\nmuch his acquaintance and friend, and loving her very discreetly, so\r\nthat neither her husband nor any other suspected it, he sent one day\r\nto speak with her, praying her that it would please her vouchsafe him\r\nher favours and protesting that he, on his part, was ready to do\r\nwhatsoever she should command him. The lady, after many parleys, came\r\nto this conclusion, that she was ready to do that which Gulfardo\r\nwished, provided two things should ensue thereof; one, that this\r\nshould never be by him discovered to any and the other, that, as she\r\nhad need of two hundred gold florins for some occasion of hers, he,\r\nwho was a rich man, should give them to her; after which she would\r\nstill be at his service.\r\n\r\nGulfardo, hearing this and indignant at the sordidness of her whom he\r\nhad accounted a lady of worth, was like to exchange his fervent love\r\nfor hatred and thinking to cheat her, sent back to her, saying that he\r\nwould very willingly do this and all else in his power that might\r\nplease her and that therefore she should e'en send him word when she\r\nwould have him go to her, for that he would carry her the money, nor\r\nshould any ever hear aught of the matter, save a comrade of his in\r\nwhom he trusted greatly and who still bore him company in whatsoever\r\nhe did. The lady, or rather, I should say, the vile woman, hearing\r\nthis, was well pleased and sent to him, saying that Guasparruolo her\r\nhusband was to go to Genoa for his occasions a few days hence and that\r\nshe would presently let him know of this and send for him. Meanwhile,\r\nGulfardo, taking his opportunity, repaired to Guasparruolo and said to\r\nhim, 'I have present occasion for two hundred gold florins, the which\r\nI would have thee lend me at that same usance whereat thou art wont to\r\nlend me other monies.' The other replied that he would well and\r\nstraightway counted out to him the money.\r\n\r\nA few days thereafterward Guasparruolo went to Genoa, even as the\r\nlady had said, whereupon she sent to Gulfardo to come to her and\r\nbring the two hundred gold florins. Accordingly, he took his comrade\r\nand repaired to the lady's house, where finding her expecting him, the\r\nfirst thing he did was to put into her hands the two hundred gold\r\nflorins, in his friend's presence, saying to her, 'Madam, take these\r\nmonies and give them to your husband, whenas he shall be returned.'\r\nThe lady took them, never guessing why he said thus, but supposing\r\nthat he did it so his comrade should not perceive that he gave them to\r\nher by way of price, and answered, 'With all my heart; but I would\r\nfain see how many they are.' Accordingly, she turned them out upon the\r\ntable and finding them full two hundred, laid them up, mighty content\r\nin herself; then, returning to Gulfardo and carrying him into her\r\nchamber, she satisfied him of her person not that night only, but many\r\nothers before her husband returned from Genoa.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the latter came back, Gulfardo, having spied out a time\r\nwhen he was in company with his wife, betook himself to him, together\r\nwith his comrade aforesaid, and said to him, in the lady's presence,\r\n'Guasparruolo, I had no occasion for the monies, to wit, the two\r\nhundred gold florins, thou lentest me the other day, for that I could\r\nnot compass the business for which I borrowed them. Accordingly, I\r\nbrought them presently back to thy lady here and gave them to her;\r\nwherefore look thou cancel my account.' Guasparruolo, turning to his\r\nwife, asked her if she had the monies, and she, seeing the witness\r\npresent, knew not how to deny, but said, 'Ay, I had them and had not\r\nyet remembered me to tell thee.' Whereupon quoth Guasparruolo,\r\n'Gulfardo, I am satisfied; get you gone and God go with you: I will\r\nsettle your account aright.' Gulfardo gone, the lady, finding herself\r\ncozened, gave her husband the dishonourable price of her baseness; and\r\non this wise the crafty lover enjoyed his sordid mistress without\r\ncost.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Eighth]\r\n\r\n     THE PARISH PRIEST OF VARLUNGO LIETH WITH MISTRESS BELCOLORE\r\n     AND LEAVETH HER A CLOAK OF HIS IN PLEDGE; THEN, BORROWING A\r\n     MORTAR OF HER, HE SENDETH IT BACK TO HER, DEMANDING IN\r\n     RETURN THE CLOAK LEFT BY WAY OF TOKEN, WHICH THE GOOD WOMAN\r\n     GRUDGINGLY GIVETH HIM BACK\r\n\r\n\r\nMen and ladies alike commended that which Gulfardo had done to the\r\nsordid Milanese lady, and the queen, turning to Pamfilo, smilingly\r\ncharged him follow on; whereupon quoth he, \"Fair ladies, it occurreth\r\nto me to tell you a little story against those who continually offend\r\nagainst us, without being open to retaliation on our part, to wit, the\r\nclergy, who have proclaimed a crusade against our wives and who,\r\nwhenas they avail to get one of the latter under them, conceive\r\nthemselves to have gained forgiveness of fault and pardon of penalty\r\nno otherwise than as they had brought the Soldan bound from\r\nAlexandria to Avignon.[365] Whereof the wretched laymen cannot return\r\nthem the like, albeit they wreak their ire upon the priests' mothers\r\nand sisters, doxies and daughters, assailing them with no less ardour\r\nthan the former do their wives. Wherefore I purpose to recount to you\r\na village love-affair, more laughable for its conclusion than long in\r\nwords, wherefrom you may yet gather, by way of fruit, that priests are\r\nnot always to be believed in everything.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 365: Where the papal court then was. See p. 257, note.]\r\n\r\nYou must know, then, that there was once at Varlungo,--a village very\r\nnear here, as each of you ladies either knoweth or may have heard,--a\r\nworthy priest and a lusty of his person in the service of the ladies,\r\nwho, albeit he knew not overwell how to read, natheless regaled his\r\nparishioners with store of good and pious saws at the elmfoot on\r\nSundays and visited their women, whenas they went abroad anywhither,\r\nmore diligently than any priest who had been there aforetime, carrying\r\nthem fairings and holy water and a stray candle-end or so, whiles even\r\nto their houses. Now it chanced that, among other his she-parishioners\r\nwho were most to his liking, one pleased him over all, by name\r\nMistress Belcolore, the wife of a husbandman who styled himself\r\nBentivegna del Mazzo, a jolly, buxom country wench, brown-favoured and\r\ntight-made, as apt at turning the mill[366] as any woman alive.\r\nMoreover, it was she who knew how to play the tabret and sing 'The\r\nwater runneth to the ravine' and lead up the haye and the round, when\r\nneed was, with a fine muckender in her hand and a quaint, better than\r\nany woman of her neighbourhood; by reason of which things my lord\r\npriest became so sore enamoured of her that he was like to lose his\r\nwits therefor and would prowl about all day long to get a sight of\r\nher. Whenas he espied her in church of a Sunday morning, he would say\r\na Kyrie and a Sanctus, studying to show himself a past master in\r\ndescant, that it seemed as it were an ass a-braying; whereas, when he\r\nsaw her not there, he passed that part of the service over lightly\r\nenough. But yet he made shift to do on such wise that neither\r\nBentivegna nor any of his neighbours suspected aught; and the better\r\nto gain Mistress Belcolore's goodwill, he made her presents from time\r\nto time, sending her whiles a clove of garlic, which he had the finest\r\nof all the countryside in a garden he tilled with his own hands, and\r\notherwhiles a punnet of peascods or a bunch of chives or scallions,\r\nand whenas he saw his opportunity, he would ogle her askance and cast\r\na friendly gibe at her; but she, putting on the prude, made a show of\r\nnot observing it and passed on with a demure air; wherefore my lord\r\npriest could not come by his will of her.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 366: Or, as La Fontaine would say, \"aussi bien faite pour\r\narmer un lit.\"]\r\n\r\nIt chanced one day that as he sauntered about the quarter on the\r\nstroke of noon, he encountered Bentivegna del Mazzo, driving an ass\r\nladen with gear, and accosting him, asked whither he went. 'Faith,\r\nsir,' answered the husbandman, 'to tell you the truth, I am going to\r\ntown about a business of mine and am carrying these things to Squire\r\nBonaccorri da Ginestreto, so he may help me in I know not what whereof\r\nthe police-court judge hath summoned me by his proctor for a\r\nperemptory attendance.' The priest was rejoiced to hear this and\r\nsaid, 'Thou dost well, my son; go now with my benison and return\r\nspeedily; and shouldst thou chance to see Lapuccio or Naldino, forget\r\nnot to bid them bring me those straps they wot of for my flails.'\r\nBentivegna answered that it should be done and went his way towards\r\nFlorence, whereupon the priest bethought himself that now was his time\r\nto go try his luck with Belcolore. Accordingly, he let not the grass\r\ngrow under his feet, but set off forthright and stayed not till he\r\ncame to her house and entering in, said, 'God send us all well! Who is\r\nwithin there?' Belcolore, who was gone up into the hay-loft, hearing\r\nhim, said, 'Marry, sir, you are welcome; but what do you gadding it\r\nabroad in this heat?' 'So God give me good luck,' answered he, 'I came\r\nto abide with thee awhile, for that I met thy man going to town.'\r\n\r\nBelcolore came down and taking a seat, fell to picking over\r\ncabbage-seed which her husband had threshed out a while before;\r\nwhereupon quoth the priest to her, 'Well, Belcolore, wilt thou still\r\ncause me die for thee on this wise?' She laughed and answered, 'What\r\nis it I do to you?' Quoth he, 'Thou dost nought to me, but thou\r\nsufferest me not do to thee that which I would fain do and which God\r\ncommandeth.' 'Alack!' cried Belcolore, 'Go to, go to. Do priests do\r\nsuch things?' 'Ay do we,' replied he, 'as well as other men; and why\r\nnot? And I tell thee more, we do far and away better work and knowest\r\nthou why? Because we grind with a full head of water. But in good\r\nsooth it shall be shrewdly to thy profit, an thou wilt but abide quiet\r\nand let me do.' 'And what might this \"shrewdly to my profit\" be?'\r\nasked she. 'For all you priests are stingier than the devil.' Quoth\r\nhe, 'I know not; ask thou. Wilt have a pair of shoes or a head-lace or\r\na fine stammel waistband or what thou wilt?' 'Pshaw!' cried Belcolore.\r\n'I have enough and to spare of such things; but an you wish me so\r\nwell, why do you not render me a service, and I will do what you\r\nwill?' Quoth the priest, 'Say what thou wilt have of me, and I will do\r\nit willingly.' Then said she, 'Needs must I go to Florence, come\r\nSaturday, to carry back the wool I have spun and get my spinning-wheel\r\nmended; and an you will lend me five crowns, which I know you have by\r\nyou, I can take my watchet gown out of pawn and my Sunday girdle[367]\r\nthat I brought my husband, for you see I cannot go to church nor to\r\nany decent place, because I have them not; and after I will still do\r\nwhat you would have me.' 'So God give me a good year,' replied the\r\npriest, 'I have them not about me; but believe me, ere Saturday come,\r\nI will contrive that thou shalt have them, and that very willingly.'\r\n'Ay,' said Belcolore, 'you are all like this, great promisers, and\r\nafter perform nothing to any. Think you to do with me as you did with\r\nBiliuzza, who went off with the ghittern-player?[368] Cock's faith,\r\nthen, you shall not, for that she is turned a common drab only for\r\nthat. If you have them not about you, go for them.' 'Alack,' cried the\r\npriest, 'put me not upon going all the way home. Thou seest that I\r\nhave the luck just now to find thee alone, but maybe, when I return,\r\nthere will be some one or other here to hinder us; and I know not when\r\nI shall find so good an opportunity again.' Quoth she, 'It is well; an\r\nyou choose to go, go; if not, go without.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 367: Or apron.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 368: _Se n'andò col ceteratojo_; a proverbial expression of\r\nsimilar meaning to our \"was whistled down the wind,\" _i.e._ was\r\nlightly dismissed without provision, like a cast-off hawk.]\r\n\r\nThe priest, seeing that she was not in the humour to do his pleasure\r\nwithout a _salvum me fac_, whereas he would fain have done it _sine\r\ncustodiâ_, said, 'Harkye, thou believest not that I will bring thee\r\nthe money; but, so thou mayst credit me, I will leave thee this my\r\nblue-cloth cloak.' Belcolore raised her eyes and said, 'Eh what! That\r\ncloak? What is it worth?' 'Worth?' answered the priest. 'I would have\r\nthee know that it is cloth of Douay, nay, Threeay, and there be some\r\nof our folk here who hold it for Fouray.[369] It is scarce a fortnight\r\nsince it cost me seven crowns of hard money to Lotto the broker, and\r\naccording to what Buglietto telleth me (and thou knowest he is a judge\r\nof this kind of cloth), I had it good five shillings overcheap.'\r\n'Indeed!' quoth Belcolore. 'So God be mine aid, I had never thought\r\nit. But give it me first of all.' My lord priest, who had his arbalest\r\nready cocked, pulled off the cloak and gave it her; and she, after she\r\nhad laid it up, said, 'Come, sir, let us go into the barn, for no one\r\never cometh there.' And so they did. There the priest gave her the\r\nheartiest busses in the world and making her sib to God Almighty,[370]\r\nsolaced himself with her a great while; after which he took leave of\r\nher and returned to the parsonage in his cassock, as it were he came\r\nfrom officiating at a wedding.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 369: A play of words upon the Italian equivalent of the\r\nFrench word Douay (_Duagio, i.e. Twoay, Treagio, Quattragio_) invented\r\nby the roguish priest to impose upon the simple goodwife.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 370: Or in modern parlance, \"making her a connection by\r\nmarriage of etc.,\" Boccaccio feigning priests to be members of the\r\nHoly Family, by virtue of their office.]\r\n\r\nThere, bethinking himself that all the candle-ends he got by way of\r\noffertory in all the year were not worth the half of five crowns,\r\nhimseemed he had done ill and repenting him of having left the cloak,\r\nhe fell to considering how he might have it again without cost. Being\r\nshrewd enough in a small way, he soon hit upon a device and it\r\nsucceeded to his wish; for that on the morrow, it being a holiday, he\r\nsent a neighbour's lad of his to Mistress Belcolore's house, with a\r\nmessage praying her be pleased to lend him her stone mortar, for that\r\nBinguccio dal Poggio and Nuto Buglietti were to dine with him that\r\nmorning and he had a mind to make sauce. She sent it to him and\r\ntowards dinner-time, the priest, having spied out when Bentivegna and\r\nhis wife were at meat together, called his clerk and said to him,\r\n'Carry this mortar back to Belcolore and say to her, 'His reverence\r\nbiddeth you gramercy and prayeth you send him back the cloak that the\r\nboy left you by way of token.' The clerk accordingly repaired to her\r\nhouse and there, finding her at table with Bentivegna, set down the\r\nmortar and did the priest's errand. Belcolore, hearing require the\r\ncloak again, would have answered; but her husband said, with an angry\r\nair, 'Takest thou a pledge of his reverence? I vow to Christ, I have a\r\nmind to give thee a good clout over the head! Go, give it quickly back\r\nto him, pox take thee! And in future, let him ask what he will of\r\nours, (ay, though he should seek our ass,) look that it be not denied\r\nhim.' Belcolore rose, grumbling, and pulling the cloak out of the\r\nchest, gave it to the clerk, saying, 'Tell her reverence from me,\r\nBelcolore saith, she voweth to God you shall never again pound sauce\r\nin her mortar; you have done her no such fine honour of this bout.'\r\n\r\nThe clerk made off with the cloak and did her message to the priest,\r\nwho said, laughing, 'Tell her, when thou seest her, that, an she will\r\nnot lend me her mortar, I will not lend her my pestle; and so we shall\r\nbe quits.' Bentivegna concluded that his wife had said this, because\r\nhe had chidden her, and took no heed thereof; but Belcolore bore the\r\npriest a grudge and held him at arm's length till vintage-time; when,\r\nhe having threatened to cause her go into the mouth of Lucifer the\r\ngreat devil, for very fear she made her peace with him over must and\r\nroast chestnuts and they after made merry together time and again. In\r\nlieu of the five crowns, the priest let put new parchment to her\r\ntabret and string thereto a cast of hawk's bells, and with this she\r\nwas fain to be content.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Eighth]\r\n\r\n     CALANDRINO, BRUNO AND BUFFALMACCO GO COASTING ALONG THE\r\n     MUGNONE IN SEARCH OF THE HELIOTROPE AND CALANDRINO THINKETH\r\n     TO HAVE FOUND IT. ACCORDINGLY HE RETURNETH HOME, LADEN WITH\r\n     STONES, AND HIS WIFE CHIDETH HIM; WHEREUPON, FLYING OUT INTO\r\n     A RAGE, HE BEATETH HER AND RECOUNTETH TO HIS COMPANIONS THAT\r\n     WHICH THEY KNOW BETTER THAN HE\r\n\r\n\r\nPamfilo having made an end of his story, at which the ladies had\r\nlaughed so much that they laugh yet, the queen bade Elisa follow on,\r\nwho, still laughing, began, \"I know not, charming ladies, if with a\r\nlittle story of mine, no less true than pleasant, I shall succeed in\r\nmaking you laugh as much as Pamfilo hath done with his; but I will do\r\nmy endeavor thereof.\r\n\r\nIn our city, then, which hath ever abounded in various fashions and\r\nstrange folk, there was once, no great while since, a painter called\r\nCalandrino, a simple-witted man and of strange usances. He companied\r\nmost of his time with other two painters, called the one Bruno and the\r\nother Buffalmacco, both very merry men, but otherwise well-advised and\r\nshrewd, who consorted with Calandrino for that they ofttimes had great\r\ndiversion of his fashions and his simplicity. There was then also in\r\nFlorence a young man of a mighty pleasant humor and marvellously\r\nadroit in all he had a mind to do, astute and plausible, who was\r\ncalled Maso del Saggio, and who, hearing certain traits of\r\nCalandrino's simplicity, determined to amuse himself at his expense\r\nby putting off some cheat on him or causing him believe some strange\r\nthing. He chanced one day to come upon him in the church of San\r\nGiovanni and seeing him intent upon the carved work and paintings of\r\nthe pyx, which is upon the altar of the said church and which had then\r\nnot long been placed there, he judged the place and time opportune for\r\ncarrying his intent into execution. Accordingly, acquainting a friend\r\nof his with that which he purposed to do, they both drew near unto the\r\nplace where Calandrino sat alone and feigning not to see him, fell\r\na-discoursing together of the virtues of divers stones, whereof Maso\r\nspoke as authoritatively as if he had been a great and famous\r\nlapidary.\r\n\r\nCalandrino gave ear to their talk and presently, seeing that it was no\r\nsecret, he rose to his feet and joined himself to them, to the no\r\nsmall satisfaction of Maso, who, pursuing his discourse, was asked by\r\nCalandrino where these wonder-working stones were to be found. Maso\r\nreplied that the most of them were found in Berlinzone, a city of the\r\nBasques, in a country called Bengodi,[371] where the vines are tied up\r\nwith sausages and a goose is to be had for a farthing[372] and a\r\ngosling into the bargain, and that there was a mountain all of grated\r\nParmesan cheese, whereon abode folk who did nothing but make maccaroni\r\nand ravioli[373] and cook them in capon-broth, after which they threw\r\nthem down thence and whoso got most thereof had most; and that hard by\r\nran a rivulet of vernage,[374] the best ever was drunk, without a drop\r\nof water therein. 'Marry,' cried Calandrino, 'that were a fine\r\ncountry; but tell me, what is done with the capons that they boil for\r\nbroth?' Quoth Maso, 'The Basques eat them all.' Then said Calandrino,\r\n'Wast thou ever there?' 'Was I ever there, quotha!' replied Maso. 'If\r\nI have been there once I have been there a thousand times.' 'And how\r\nmany miles is it distant hence?' asked Calandrino; and Maso, 'How\r\nmany? a million or more; you might count them all night and not know.'\r\n'Then,' said Calandrino, 'it must be farther off than the Abruzzi?'\r\n'Ay, indeed,' answered Maso; 'it is a trifle farther.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 371: _i.e._ Good cheer.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 372: A play upon the double meaning of _a denajo_, which\r\nsignifies also \"for money.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 373: A kind of rissole made of eggs, sweet herbs and\r\ncheese.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 374: _Vernaccia_, a kind of rich white wine like Malmsey.]\r\n\r\nCalandrino, like a simpleton as he was, hearing Maso tell all this\r\nwith an assured air and without laughing, gave such credence thereto\r\nas can be given to whatsoever verity is most manifest and so, holding\r\nit for truth, said, 'That is overfar for my money; though, were it\r\nnearer, I tell thee aright I would go thither with thee once upon a\r\ntime, if but to see the maccaroni come tumbling headlong down and take\r\nmy fill thereof. But tell me, God keep thee merry, is there none of\r\nthose wonder-working stones to be found in these parts?' 'Ay is\r\nthere,' answered Maso; 'there be two kinds of stones of very great\r\nvirtue found here; the first are the grits of Settignano and Montisci,\r\nby virtue whereof, when they are wrought into millstones, flour is\r\nmade; wherefore it is said in those parts that grace cometh from God\r\nand millstones from Montisci; but there is such great plenty of these\r\ngrits that they are as little prized with us as emeralds with the folk\r\nover yonder, where they have mountains of them bigger than Mount\r\nMorello, which shine in the middle of the night, I warrant thee. And\r\nthou must know that whoso should cause set fine and perfect\r\nmillstones, before they are pierced, in rings and carry them to the\r\nSoldan might have for them what he would. The other is what we\r\nlapidaries call Heliotrope, a stone of exceeding great virtue, for\r\nthat whoso hath it about him is not seen of any other person whereas\r\nhe is not, what while he holdeth it.' Quoth Calandrino, 'These be\r\nindeed great virtues; but where is this second stone found?' To which\r\nMaso replied that it was commonly found in the Mugnone. 'What bigness\r\nis this stone,' asked Calandrino, 'and what is its colour?' Quoth\r\nMaso, 'It is of various sizes, some more and some less; but all are\r\nwell nigh black of colour.'\r\n\r\nCalandrino noted all this in himself and feigning to have otherwhat to\r\ndo, took leave of Maso, inwardly determined to go seek the stone in\r\nquestion, but bethought himself not to do it without the knowledge of\r\nBruno and Buffalmacco, whom he most particularly affected. Accordingly\r\nhe addressed himself to seek for them, so they might, without delay\r\nand before any else, set about the search, and spent all the rest of\r\nthe morning seeking them. At last, when it was past none, he\r\nremembered him that they were awork in the Ladies' Convent at Faenza\r\nand leaving all his other business, he betook himself thither well\r\nnigh at a run, notwithstanding the great heat. As soon as he saw them,\r\nhe called them and bespoke them thus: 'Comrades, an you will hearken\r\nto me, we may become the richest men in all Florence, for that I have\r\nlearned from a man worthy of belief that in the Mugnone is to be found\r\na stone, which whoso carrieth about him is not seen of any; wherefore\r\nmeseemeth we were best go thither in quest thereof without delay, ere\r\nany forestall us. We shall certainly find it, for that I know it well,\r\nand when we have gotten it, what have we to do but put it in our poke\r\nand getting us to the moneychangers' tables, which you know stand\r\nstill laden with groats and florins, take as much as we will thereof?\r\nNone will see us, and so may we grow rich of a sudden, without having\r\nto smear walls all day long, snail-fashion.'\r\n\r\nBruno and Buffalmacco, hearing this, fell a-laughing in their sleeves\r\nand eyeing each other askance, made a show of exceeding wonderment and\r\npraised Calandrino's counsel, but Bruno asked how the stone in\r\nquestion was called. Calandrino, who was a clod-pated fellow, had\r\nalready forgotten the name, wherefore quoth he, 'What have we to do\r\nwith the name, since we know the virtue of the stone? Meseemeth we\r\nwere best go about the quest without more ado.' 'Well, then,' said\r\nBruno, 'how is it fashioned?' 'It is of all fashions,' replied\r\nCalandrino; 'but all are well nigh black; wherefore meseemeth that\r\nwhat we have to do is to gather up all the black stones we see, till\r\nwe happen upon the right. So let us lose no time, but get us gone.'\r\nQuoth Bruno, 'Wait awhile,' and turning to his comrade, said,\r\n'Methinketh Calandrino saith well; but meseemeth this is no season\r\nfor the search, for that the sun is high and shineth full upon the\r\nMugnone, where it hath dried all the stones, so that certain of those\r\nthat be there appear presently white, which of a morning, ere the sun\r\nhave dried them, show black; more by token that, to-day being a\r\nworking day, there be many folk, on one occasion or another abroad\r\nalong the banks, who, seeing us, may guess what we are about and maybe\r\ndo likewise, whereby the stone may come to their hands and we shall\r\nhave lost the trot for the amble. Meseemeth (an you be of the same way\r\nof thinking) that this is a business to be undertaken of a morning,\r\nwhenas the black may be the better known from the white, and of a\r\nholiday, when there will be none there to see us.'\r\n\r\nBuffalmacco commended Bruno's counsel and Calandrino fell in\r\ntherewith; wherefore they agreed to go seek for the stone all three on\r\nthe following Sunday morning, and Calandrino besought them over all\r\nelse not to say a word of the matter to any one alive, for that it had\r\nbeen imparted to him in confidence, and after told them that which he\r\nhad heard tell of the land of Bengodi, affirming with an oath that it\r\nwas as he said. As soon as he had taken his leave, the two others\r\nagreed with each other what they should do in the matter and\r\nCalandrino impatiently awaited the Sunday morning, which being come,\r\nhe arose at break of day and called his friends, with whom he sallied\r\nforth of the city by the San Gallo gate and descending into the bed of\r\nthe Mugnone, began to go searching down stream for the stone.\r\nCalandrino, as the eagerest of the three, went on before, skipping\r\nnimbly hither and thither, and whenever he espied any black stone, he\r\npounced upon it and picking it up, thrust it into his bosom. His\r\ncomrades followed after him picking up now one stone and now another;\r\nbut Calandrino had not gone far before he had his bosom full of\r\nstones; wherefore, gathering up the skirts of his grown, which was not\r\ncut Flanders fashion,[375] he tucked them well into his surcingle all\r\nround and made an ample lap thereof. However, it was no great while\r\nere he had filled it, and making a lap on like wise of his mantle,\r\nsoon filled this also with stones. Presently, the two others seeing\r\nthat he had gotten his load and that dinner-time drew nigh, quoth\r\nBruno to Buffalmacco, in accordance with the plan concerted between\r\nthem, 'Where is Calandrino?' Buffalmacco, who saw him hard by, turned\r\nabout and looking now here and now there, answered, 'I know not; but\r\nhe was before us but now.' 'But now, quotha!' cried Bruno. 'I warrant\r\nyou he is presently at home at dinner and hath left us to play the\r\nfool here, seeking black stones down the Mugnone.' 'Egad,' rejoined\r\nBuffalmacco 'he hath done well to make mock of us and leave us here,\r\nsince we were fools enough to credit him. Marry, who but we had been\r\nsimple enough to believe that a stone of such virtue was to be found\r\nin the Mugnone?'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 375: _i.e._ not strait-cut.]\r\n\r\nCalandrino, hearing this, concluded that the heliotrope had fallen\r\ninto his hands and that by virtue thereof they saw him not, albeit he\r\nwas present with them, and rejoiced beyond measure at such a piece of\r\ngood luck, answered them not a word, but determined to return;\r\nwherefore, turning back, he set off homeward. Buffalmacco, seeing\r\nthis, said to Bruno, 'What shall we do? Why do we not get us gone?'\r\nWhereto Bruno answered, 'Let us begone; but I vow to God that\r\nCalandrino shall never again serve me thus, and were I presently near\r\nhim as I have been all the morning, I would give him such a clout on\r\nthe shins with this stone that he should have cause to remember this\r\ntrick for maybe a month to come.' To say this and to let fly at\r\nCalandrino's shins with the stone were one and the same thing; and the\r\nlatter, feeling the pain, lifted up his leg and began to puff and\r\nblow, but yet held his peace and fared on. Presently Buffalmacco took\r\none of the flints he had picked up and said to Bruno, 'Look at this\r\nfine flint; here should go for Calandrino's loins!' So saying, he let\r\nfly and dealt him a sore rap in the small of the back with the stone.\r\nBrief, on this wise, now with one word and now with another, they went\r\npelting him up the Mugnone till they came to the San Gallo gate, where\r\nthey threw down the stones they had gathered and halted awhile at the\r\ncustom house.\r\n\r\nThe officers, forewarned by them, feigned not to see Calandrino and\r\nlet him pass, laughing heartily at the jest, whilst he, without\r\nstopping, made straight for his house, which was near the Canto alla\r\nMacina, and fortune so far favoured the cheat that none accosted him,\r\nas he came up the stream and after through the city, as, indeed, he\r\nmet with few, for that well nigh every one was at dinner. Accordingly,\r\nhe reached his house, thus laden, and as chance would have it, his\r\nwife, a fair and virtuous lady, by name Mistress Tessa, was at the\r\nstairhead. Seeing him come and somewhat provoked at his long\r\ntarriance, she began to rail at him, saying, 'Devil take the man! Wilt\r\nthou never think to come home betimes? All the folk have already dined\r\nwhenas thou comest back to dinner.' Calandrino, hearing this and\r\nfinding that he was seen, was overwhelmed with chagrin and vexation\r\nand cried out, 'Alack, wicked woman that thou art, wast thou there?\r\nThou hast undone me; but, by God His faith, I will pay thee therefor!'\r\nTherewithal he ran up to a little saloon he had and there disburdened\r\nhimself of the mass of stones he had brought home; then, running in a\r\nfury at his wife, he laid hold of her by the hair and throwing her\r\ndown at his feet, cuffed and kicked her in every part as long as he\r\ncould wag his arms and legs, without leaving a hair on her head or a\r\nbone in her body that was not beaten to a mash, nor did it avail her\r\naught to cry him mercy with clasped hands.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Bruno and Buffalmacco, after laughing awhile with the\r\nkeepers of the gate, proceeded with slow step to follow Calandrino\r\nafar off and presently coming to the door of his house, heard the\r\ncruel beating he was in act to give his wife; whereupon, making a show\r\nof having but then come back, they called Calandrino, who came to the\r\nwindow, all asweat and red with anger and vexation, and prayed them\r\ncome up to him. Accordingly, they went up, making believe to be\r\nsomewhat vexed, and seeing the room full of stones and the lady, all\r\ntorn and dishevelled and black and blue in the face for bruises,\r\nweeping piteously in one corner of the room, whilst Calandrino sat in\r\nanother, untrussed and panting like one forspent, eyed them awhile,\r\nthen said, 'What is this, Calandrino? Art thou for building, that we\r\nsee all these stones here? And Mistress Tessa, what aileth her? It\r\nseemeth thou hast beaten her. What is all this ado?' Calandrino,\r\noutwearied with the weight of the stones and the fury with which he\r\nhad beaten his wife, no less than with chagrin for the luck which\r\nhimseemed he had lost, could not muster breath to give them aught but\r\nbroken words in reply; wherefore, as he delayed to answer, Buffalmacco\r\nwent on, 'Harkye, Calandrino, whatever other cause for anger thou\r\nmightest have had, thou shouldst not have fooled us as thou hast done,\r\nin that, after thou hadst carried us off to seek with thee for the\r\nwonder-working stone, thou leftest us in the Mugnone, like a couple of\r\ngulls, and madest off home, without saying so much as God be with you\r\nor devil; the which we take exceeding ill; but assuredly this shall be\r\nthe last trick thou shalt ever play us.'\r\n\r\nTherewithal, Calandrino enforcing himself,[376] answered, 'Comrades,\r\nbe not angered; the case standeth otherwise than as you deem. I\r\n(unlucky wretch that I am!) had found the stone in question, and you\r\nshall hear if I tell truth. When first you questioned one another of\r\nme, I was less than half a score yards distant from you; but, seeing\r\nthat you made off and saw me not, I went on before you and came back\r\nhither, still keeping a little in front of you.' Then, beginning from\r\nthe beginning, he recounted to them all that they had said and done,\r\nfirst and last, and showed them how the stones had served his back and\r\nshins; after which, 'And I may tell you,' continued he, 'that, whenas\r\nI entered in at the gate, with all these stones about me which you see\r\nhere, there was nothing said to me, albeit you know how vexatious and\r\ntiresome these gatekeepers use to be in wanting to see everything;\r\nmore by token that I met by the way several of my friends and gossips,\r\nwho are still wont to accost me and invite me to drink; but none of\r\nthem said a word to me, no, nor half a word, as those who saw me not.\r\nAt last, being come home hither, this accursed devil of a woman\r\npresented herself before me, for that, as you know, women cause\r\neverything lose its virtue, wherefore I, who might else have called\r\nmyself the luckiest man in Florence, am become the most unlucky. For\r\nthis I have beaten her as long as I could wag my fists and I know not\r\nwhat hindereth me from slitting her weasand, accursed be the hour when\r\nfirst I saw her and when she came to me in this house.' Then, flaming\r\nout into fresh anger, he offered to rise and beat her anew.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 376: _Sforzandosi_, _i.e._ recovering his wind with an\r\neffort.]\r\n\r\nBruno and Buffalmacco, hearing all this, made believe to marvel\r\nexceedingly and often confirmed that which Calandrino said, albeit\r\nthey had the while so great a mind to laugh that they were like to\r\nburst; but, seeing him start up in a rage to beat his wife again, they\r\nrose upon him and withheld him, avouching that the lady was nowise at\r\nfault, but that he had only himself to blame for that which had\r\nhappened, since he knew that women caused things to lose their virtue\r\nand had not bidden her beware of appearing before him that day, and\r\nthat God had bereft him of foresight to provide against this, either\r\nfor that the adventure was not to be his or because he had had it in\r\nmind to cozen his comrades, to whom he should have discovered the\r\nmatter, as soon as he perceived that he had found the stone. Brief,\r\nafter many words, they made peace, not without much ado, between him\r\nand the woebegone lady and went their ways, leaving him disconsolate,\r\nwith the house full of stones.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Eighth]\r\n\r\n     THE RECTOR OF FIESOLE LOVETH A WIDOW LADY, BUT IS NOT LOVED\r\n     BY HER AND THINKING TO LIE WITH HER, LIETH WITH A\r\n     SERVING-WENCH OF HERS, WHILST THE LADY'S BROTHERS CAUSE THE\r\n     BISHOP FIND HIM IN THIS CASE\r\n\r\n\r\nElisa being come to the end of her story, which she had related to the\r\nno small pleasure of all the company, the queen turned to Emilia, and\r\nsignified to her her wish that she should follow after with her story,\r\nwhereupon she promptly began thus: \"I have not forgotten, noble\r\nladies, that it hath already been shown, in sundry of the foregoing\r\nstories, how much we women are exposed to the importunities of the\r\npriests and friars and clergy of every kind; but, seeing that so much\r\ncannot be said thereof but that yet more will remain to say, I\r\npurpose, to boot, to tell you a story of a rector, who, maugre all the\r\nworld, would e'en have a gentlewoman wish him well,[377] whether she\r\nwould or not; whereupon she, like a very discreet woman as she was,\r\nused him as he deserved.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 377: _i.e._ love him, grant him her favours. See ante,\r\npassim.]\r\n\r\nAs all of you know, Fiesole, whose hill we can see hence, was once a\r\nvery great and ancient city, nor, albeit it is nowadays all undone,\r\nhath it ever ceased to be, as it is yet, the seat of a bishop. Near\r\nthe cathedral church there a widow lady of noble birth, by name Madam\r\nPiccarda, had an estate, where, for that she was not overwell to do,\r\nshe abode the most part of the year in a house of hers that was not\r\nvery big, and with her, two brothers of hers, very courteous and\r\nworthy youths. It chanced that, the lady frequenting the cathedral\r\nchurch and being yet very young and fair and agreeable, the rector of\r\nthe church became so sore enamoured of her that he could think of\r\nnothing else, and after awhile, making bold to discover his mind to\r\nher, he prayed her accept of his love and love him as he loved her.\r\nNow he was already old in years, but very young in wit, malapert and\r\narrogant and presumptuous in the extreme, with manners and fashions\r\nfull of conceit and ill grace, and withal so froward and\r\nill-conditioned that there was none who wished him well; and if any\r\nhad scant regard for him, it was the lady in question, who not only\r\nwished him no whit of good, but hated him worse than the megrims;\r\nwherefore, like a discreet woman as she was, she answered him, 'Sir,\r\nthat you love me should be mighty pleasing to me, who am bound to love\r\nyou and will gladly do so; but between your love and mine nothing\r\nunseemly should ever befall. You are my spiritual father and a priest\r\nand are presently well stricken in years, all which things should make\r\nyou both modest and chaste; whilst I, on the other hand, am no girl,\r\nnor do these amorous toys beseem my present condition, for that I am a\r\nwidow and you well know what discretion is required in widows;\r\nwherefore I pray you hold me excused, for that I shall never love you\r\nafter the fashion whereof you require me; nor do I wish to be thus\r\nloved of you.'\r\n\r\nThe rector could get of her no other answer for that time, but, nowise\r\ndaunted or disheartened by the first rebuff, solicited her again and\r\nagain with the most overweening importunity, both by letter and\r\nmessage, nay, even by word of mouth, whenas he saw her come into the\r\nchurch. Wherefor, herseeming that this was too great and too grievous\r\nan annoy, she cast about to rid herself of him after such a fashion as\r\nhe deserved, since she could no otherwise, but would do nought ere she\r\nhad taken counsel with her brothers. Accordingly, she acquainted them\r\nwith the rector's behaviour towards her and that which she purposed to\r\ndo, and having therein full license from them, went a few days after\r\nto the church, as was her wont. As soon as the rector saw her, he came\r\nup to her and with his usual assurance, accosted her familiarly. The\r\nlady received him with a cheerful countenance and withdrawing apart\r\nwith him, after he had said many words to her in his wonted style, she\r\nheaved a great sigh and said, 'Sir, I have heard that there is no\r\nfortalice so strong but that, being every day assaulted, it cometh at\r\nlast to be taken, and this I can very well see to have happened to\r\nmyself; for that you have so closely beset me with soft words and with\r\none complaisance and another, that you have made me break my resolve,\r\nand I am now disposed, since I please you thus, to consent to be\r\nyours.' 'Gramercy, madam,' answered the rector, overjoyed, 'to tell\r\nyou the truth, I have often wondered how you could hold out so long,\r\nconsidering that never did the like betide me with any woman; nay, I\r\nhave said whiles, \"Were women of silver, they would not be worth a\r\nfarthing, for that not one of them would stand the hammer.\" But let\r\nthat pass for the present. When and where can we be together?' Whereto\r\nquoth the lady, 'Sweet my lord, as for the when, it may be what time\r\nsoever most pleaseth us, for that I have no husband to whom it\r\nbehoveth me render an account of my nights; but for the where I know\r\nnot how to contrive.' 'How?' cried the priest. 'Why, in your house to\r\nbe sure.' 'Sir,' answered the lady, 'you know I have two young\r\nbrothers, who come and go about the house with their companions day\r\nand night, and my house is not overbig; wherefore it may not be there,\r\nexcept one chose to abide there mute-fashion, without saying a word or\r\nmaking the least sound, and be in the dark, after the manner of the\r\nblind. An you be content to do this, it might be, for they meddle not\r\nwith my bedchamber; but their own is so close to mine that one cannot\r\nwhisper the least word, without its being heard.' 'Madam,' answered\r\nthe rector, 'this shall not hinder us for a night or two, against I\r\nbethink me where we may foregather more at ease.' Quoth she, 'Sir, let\r\nthat rest with you; but of one thing I pray you, that this abide\r\nsecret, so no word be ever known thereof.' 'Madam,' replied he, 'have\r\nno fear for that; but, an it may be, make shift that we shall\r\nforegather this evening.' 'With all my heart,' said the lady; and\r\nappointing him how and when he should come, she took leave of him and\r\nreturned home.\r\n\r\nNow she had a serving-wench, who was not overyoung, but had the\r\nfoulest and worst-favoured visnomy was ever seen; for she had a nose\r\nflattened sore, a mouth all awry, thick lips and great ill-set teeth;\r\nmoreover, she inclined to squint, nor was ever without sore eyes, and\r\nhad a green and yellow complexion, which gave her the air of having\r\npassed the summer not at Fiesole, but at Sinigaglia.[378] Besides all\r\nthis, she was hipshot and a thought crooked on the right side. Her\r\nname was Ciuta, but, for that she had such a dog's visnomy of her own,\r\nshe was called of every one Ciutazza;[379] and for all she was\r\nmisshapen of her person, she was not without a spice of roguishness.\r\nThe lady called her and said to her, 'Harkye, Ciutazza, an thou wilt\r\ndo me a service this night. I will give thee a fine new shift.'\r\nCiutazza, hearing speak of the shift, answered, 'Madam, so you give me\r\na shift, I will cast myself into the fire, let alone otherwhat.'\r\n'Well, then,' said her mistress, 'I would have thee lie to-night with\r\na man in my bed and load him with caresses, but take good care not to\r\nsay a word, lest thou be heard by my brothers, who, as thou knowest,\r\nsleep in the next room; and after I will give thee the shift.' Quoth\r\nCiutazza, 'With all my heart. I will lie with half a dozen men, if\r\nneed be, let alone one.' Accordingly, at nightfall, my lord the rector\r\nmade his appearance, according to agreement, whilst the two young men,\r\nby the lady's appointment, were in their bedchamber and took good care\r\nto make themselves heard; wherefore he entered the lady's chamber in\r\nsilence and darkness and betook himself, as she had bidden him,\r\nstraight to the bed, whither on her part came Ciutazza, who had been\r\nwell lessoned by the lady of that which she had to do. My lord rector,\r\nthinking he had his mistress beside him, caught Ciutazza in his arms\r\nand fell to kissing her, without saying a word, and she him; whereupon\r\nhe proceeded to solace himself with her, taking, as he thought,\r\npossession of the long-desired good.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 378: _i.e._ in the malaria district.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 379: _i.e._ great ugly Ciuta.]\r\n\r\nThe lady, having done this, charged her brothers carry the rest of the\r\nplot into execution, wherefore, stealing softly out of the chamber,\r\nthey made for the great square and fortune was more favorable to them\r\nthan they themselves asked in that which they had a mind to do,\r\ninasmuch as, the heat being great, the bishop had enquired for the two\r\nyoung gentlemen, so he might go a-pleasuring to their house and drink\r\nwith them. But, seeing them coming, he acquainted them with his wish\r\nand returned with them to their house, where, entering a cool little\r\ncourtyard of theirs, in which were many flambeaux alight, he drank\r\nwith great pleasure of an excellent wine of theirs. When he had\r\ndrunken, the young men said to him, 'My lord, since you have done us\r\nso much favour as to deign to visit this our poor house, whereto we\r\ncame to invite you, we would have you be pleased to view a small\r\nmatter with which we would fain show you.' The bishop answered that he\r\nwould well; whereupon one of the young men, taking a lighted flambeau\r\nin his hand, made for the chamber where my lord rector lay with\r\nCiutazza, followed by the bishop and all the rest. The rector, to\r\narrive the quicklier at his journey's end, had hastened to take horse\r\nand had already ridden more than three miles before they came thither;\r\nwherefore, being somewhat weary, he had, notwithstanding the heat,\r\nfallen asleep with Ciutazza in his arms. Accordingly, when the young\r\nman entered the chamber, light in hand, and after him the bishop and\r\nall the others, he was shown to the prelate in this plight; whereupon\r\nhe awoke and seeing the light and the folk about him, was sore abashed\r\nand hid his head for fear under the bed-clothes. The bishop gave him a\r\nsound rating and made him put out his head and see with whom he had\r\nlain; whereupon the rector, understanding the trick that had been\r\nplayed him of the lady, what with this and what with the disgrace\r\nhimseemed he had gotten, became of a sudden the woefullest man that\r\nwas aye. Then, having, by the bishop's commandment, reclad himself, he\r\nwas despatched to his house under good guard, to suffer sore penance\r\nfor the sin he had committed. The bishop presently enquiring how it\r\ncame to pass that he had gone thither to lie with Ciutazza, the young\r\nmen orderly related everything to him, which having heard, he greatly\r\ncommended both the lady and her brothers for that, without choosing to\r\nimbrue their hands in the blood of a priest, they had entreated him as\r\nhe deserved. As for the rector, he caused him bewail his offence forty\r\ndays' space; but love and despite made him rue it for more than\r\nnine-and-forty,[380] more by token that, for a great while after, he\r\ncould never go abroad but the children would point at him and say,\r\n'See, there is he who lay with Ciutazza'; the which was so sore an\r\nannoy to him that he was like to go mad therefor. On such wise did the\r\nworthy lady rid herself of the importunity of the malapert rector and\r\nCiutazza gained the shift and a merry night.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 380: _Quarantanove_, a proverbial expression for an\r\nindefinite number.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Eighth]\r\n\r\n     THREE YOUNG MEN PULL THE BREECHES OFF A MARCHEGAN JUDGE IN\r\n     FLORENCE, WHAT WHILE HE IS ON THE BENCH, ADMINISTERING\r\n     JUSTICE\r\n\r\n\r\nEmilia having made an end of her story and the widow lady having been\r\ncommended of all, the queen looked to Filostrato and said, \"It is now\r\nthy turn to tell.\" He answered promptly that he was ready and began,\r\n\"Delightsome ladies, the mention by Elisa a little before of a certain\r\nyoung man, to wit, Maso del Saggio, hath caused me leave a story I\r\npurposed to tell you, so I may relate to you one of him and certain\r\ncompanions of his, which, if (albeit it is nowise unseemly) it offer\r\ncertain expressions which you think shame to use, is natheless so\r\nlaughable that I will e'en tell it.\r\n\r\nAs you may all have heard, there come oftentimes to our city governors\r\nfrom the Marches of Ancona, who are commonly mean-spirited folk and so\r\npaltry and sordid of life that their every fashion seemeth nought\r\nother than a lousy cadger's trick; and of this innate paltriness and\r\navarice, they bring with them judges and notaries, who seem men taken\r\nfrom the plough-tail or the cobbler's stall rather than from the\r\nschools of law. Now, one of these being come hither for Provost, among\r\nthe many judges whom he brought with him was one who styled himself\r\nMesser Niccola da San Lepidio and who had more the air of a tinker\r\nthan of aught else, and he was set with other judges to hear criminal\r\ncauses. As it oft happeneth that, for all the townsfolk have nought in\r\nthe world to do at the courts of law, yet bytimes they go thither, it\r\nbefell that Maso del Saggio went thither one morning, in quest of a\r\nfriend of his, and chancing to cast his eyes whereas this said Messer\r\nNiccola sat, himseemed that here was a rare outlandish kind of wild\r\nfowl. Accordingly, he went on to examine him from head to foot, and\r\nalbeit he saw him with the miniver bonnet on his head all black with\r\nsmoke and grease and a paltry inkhorn at his girdle, a gown longer\r\nthan his mantle and store of other things all foreign to a man of good\r\nbreeding and manners, yet of all these the most notable, to his\r\nthinking, was a pair of breeches, the backside whereof, as the judge\r\nsat, with his clothes standing open in front for straitness, he\r\nperceived came halfway down his legs. Thereupon, without tarrying\r\nlonger to look upon him, he left him with whom he went seeking and\r\nbeginning a new quest, presently found two comrades of his, called one\r\nRibi and the other Matteuzzo, men much of the same mad humour as\r\nhimself, and said to them, 'As you tender me, come with me to the law\r\ncourts, for I wish to show you the rarest scarecrow you ever saw.'\r\n\r\nAccordingly, carrying them to the court house, he showed them the\r\naforesaid judge and his breeches, whereat they fell a-laughing, as\r\nsoon as they caught sight of him afar off; then, drawing nearer to the\r\nplatform whereon my lord judge sat, they saw that one might lightly\r\npass thereunder and that, moreover, the boards under his feet were so\r\nbroken that one might with great ease thrust his hand and arm between\r\nthem; whereupon quoth Maso to his comrades, 'Needs must we pull him\r\noff those breeches of his altogether, for that it may very well be\r\ndone.' Each of the others had already seen how;[381] wherefore, having\r\nagreed among themselves what they should say and do, they returned\r\nthither next morning, when, the court being very full of folk,\r\nMatteuzzo, without being seen of any, crept under the bench and posted\r\nhimself immediately beneath the judge's feet. Meanwhile, Maso came up\r\nto my lord judge on one side and taking him by the skirt of his gown,\r\nwhilst Ribi did the like on the other side, began to say, 'My lord,\r\nmy lord, I pray you for God's sake, ere yonder scurvy thief on the\r\nother side of you go elsewhere, make him restore me a pair of\r\nsaddle-bags whereof he hath saith indeed he did it not; but I saw him,\r\nnot a month ago, in act to have them resoled.' Ribi on his side cried\r\nout with all his might, 'Believe him not, my lord; he is an arrant\r\nknave, and for that he knoweth I am come to lay a complaint against\r\nhim for a pair of saddle-bags whereof he hath robbed me, he cometh now\r\nwith his story of the boothose, which I have had in my house this many\r\na day. An you believe me not, I can bring you to witness my next-door\r\nneighbor Trecca and Grassa the tripewoman and one who goeth gathering\r\nthe sweepings from Santa Masia at Verjaza, who saw him when he came\r\nback from the country.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 381: _i.e._ how they might do this.]\r\n\r\nMaso on the other hand suffered not Ribi to speak, but bawled his\r\nloudest, whereupon the other but shouted the more. The judge stood up\r\nand leaned towards them, so he might the better apprehend what they\r\nhad to say, wherefore Matteuzzo, watching his opportunity, thrust his\r\nhand between the crack of the boards and laying hold of Messer\r\nNiccola's galligaskins by the breech, tugged at them amain. The\r\nbreeches came down incontinent, for that the judge was lean and lank\r\nof the crupper; whereupon, feeling this and knowing not what it might\r\nbe, he would have sat down again and pulled his skirts forward to\r\ncover himself; but Maso on the one side and Ribi on the other still\r\nheld him fast and cried out, 'My lord, you do ill not to do me justice\r\nand to seek to avoid hearing me and get you gone otherwhere; there be\r\nno writs granted in this city for such small matters as this.' So\r\nsaying, they held him fast by the clothes on such wise that all who\r\nwere in the court perceived that his breeches had been pulled down.\r\nHowever, Matteuzzo, after he had held them awhile, let them go and\r\ncoming forth from under the platform, made off out of the court and\r\nwent his way without being seen; whereupon quoth Ribi, himseeming he\r\nhad done enough, 'I vow to God I will appeal to the syndicate!' Whilst\r\nMaso, on his part, let go the mantle and said, 'Nay, I will e'en come\r\nhither again and again until such time as I find you not hindered as\r\nyou seem to be this morning.' So saying, they both made off as\r\nquickliest they might, each on his own side, whilst my lord judge\r\npulled up his breeches in every one's presence, as if he were arisen\r\nfrom sleep; then, perceiving how the case stood, he enquired whither\r\nthey were gone who were at difference anent the boothose and the\r\nsaddle-bags; but they were not to be found, whereupon he began to\r\nswear by Cock's bowels that need must he know and learn if it were the\r\nwont at Florence to pull down the judges' breeches, whenas they sat on\r\nthe judicial bench. The Provost, on his part, hearing of this, made a\r\ngreat stir; but, his friends having shown him that this had only been\r\ndone to give him notice that the Florentines right well understood\r\nhow, whereas he should have brought judges, he had brought them sorry\r\npatches, to have them better cheap, he thought it best to hold his\r\npeace, and so the thing went no farther for the nonce.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Eighth]\r\n\r\n     BRUNO AND BUFFALMACCO, HAVING STOLEN A PIG FROM CALANDRINO,\r\n     MAKE HIM TRY THE ORDEAL WITH GINGER BOLUSES AND SACK AND\r\n     GIVE HIM (INSTEAD OF THE GINGER) TWO DOG-BALLS COMPOUNDED\r\n     WITH ALOES, WHEREBY IT APPEARETH THAT HE HIMSELF HATH HAD\r\n     THE PIG AND THEY MAKE HIM PAY BLACKMAIL, AN HE WOULD NOT\r\n     HAVE THEM TELL HIS WIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Filostrato despatched his story, which had given rise to\r\nmany a laugh, than the queen bade Filomena follow on, whereupon she\r\nbegan: \"Gracious ladies, even as Filostrato was led by the mention of\r\nMaso to tell the story which you have just heard from him, so neither\r\nmore nor less am I moved by that of Calandrino and his friends to tell\r\nyou another of them, which methinketh will please you.\r\n\r\nWho Calandrino, Bruno and Buffalmacco were I need not explain to you,\r\nfor that you have already heard it well enough; wherefore, to proceed\r\nwith my story, I must tell you that Calandrino owned a little farm at\r\nno great distance from Florence, that he had had to his wife's dowry.\r\nFrom this farm, amongst other things that he got thence, he had every\r\nyear a pig, and it was his wont still to betake himself thither, he\r\nand his wife, and kill the pig and have it salted on the spot. It\r\nchanced one year that, his wife being somewhat ailing, he went himself\r\nto kill the pig, which Bruno and Buffalmacco hearing and knowing that\r\nhis wife was not gone to the farm with him, they repaired to a priest,\r\nvery great friend of theirs and a neighbor of Calandrino, to sojourn\r\nsome days with him. Now Calandrino had that very morning killed the\r\npig and seeing them with the priest, called to them saying, 'You are\r\nwelcome. I would fain have you see what a good husband[382] I am.'\r\nThen carrying them into the house, he showed them the pig, which they\r\nseeing to be a very fine one and understanding from Calandrino that he\r\nmeant to salt it down for his family, 'Good lack,' quoth Bruno to him,\r\n'what a ninny thou art! Sell it and let us make merry with the price,\r\nand tell thy wife that it hath been stolen from thee.' 'Nay, answered\r\nCalandrino, 'she would never believe it and would drive me out of the\r\nhouse. Spare your pains, for I will never do it.' And many were the\r\nwords, but they availed nothing.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 382: _i.e._ in the old sense of \"manager\" (_massajo_).]\r\n\r\nCalandrino invited them to supper, but with so ill a grace that they\r\nrefused to sup there and took their leave of him; whereupon quoth\r\nBruno and Buffalmacco, 'What sayest thou to stealing yonder pig from\r\nhim to-night?' 'Marry,' replied the other, 'how can we do it?' Quoth\r\nBruno, 'I can see how well enough, an he remove it not from where it\r\nwas but now.' 'Then,' rejoined his companion, 'let us do it. Why\r\nshould we not? And after we will make merry over it with the parson\r\nhere.' The priest answered that he would well, and Bruno said, 'Here\r\nmust some little art be used. Thou knowest, Buffalmacco, how\r\nniggardly Calandrino is and how gladly he drinketh when others pay;\r\nlet us go and carry him to the tavern, where the priest shall make\r\nbelieve to pay the whole scot in our honor nor suffer him to pay\r\naught. Calandrino will soon grow fuddled and then we can manage it\r\nlightly enough, for that he is alone in the house.' As he said, so\r\nthey did and Calandrino seeing that the priest suffered none to pay,\r\ngave himself up to drinking and took in a good load, albeit it needed\r\nno great matter to make him drunk. It was pretty late at night when\r\nthey left the tavern and Calandrino, without troubling himself about\r\nsupper, went straight home, where, thinking to have shut the door, he\r\nleft it open and betook himself to bed. Buffalmacco and Bruno went off\r\nto sup with the priest and after supper repaired quietly to\r\nCalandrino's house, carrying with them certain implements wherewithal\r\nto break in whereas Bruno had appointed it; but, finding the door\r\nopen, they entered and unhooking the pig, carried it off to the\r\npriest's house, where they laid it up and betook themselves to sleep.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, Calandrino, having slept off the fumes of the wine,\r\narose in the morning and going down, missed his pig and saw the door\r\nopen; whereupon he questioned this one and that if they knew who had\r\ntaken it and getting no news of it, began to make a great outcry,\r\nsaying, 'Woe is me, miserable wretch that I am!' for that the pig had\r\nbeen stolen from him. As soon as Bruno and Buffalmacco were risen,\r\nthey repaired to Calandrino's house, to hear what he would say anent\r\nthe pig, and he no sooner saw them than he called out to them, well\r\nnigh weeping, and said, 'Woe's me, comrades mine; my pig hath been\r\nstolen from me!' Whereupon Bruno came up to him and said softly, 'It\r\nis a marvel that thou hast been wise for once.' 'Alack,' replied\r\nCalandrino, 'indeed I say sooth.' 'That's the thing to say,' quoth\r\nBruno. 'Make a great outcry, so it may well appear that it is e'en as\r\nthou sayst.' Therewithal Calandrino bawled out yet loudlier, saying,\r\n'Cock's body, I tell thee it hath been stolen from me in good\r\nearnest!' 'Good, good,' replied Bruno; 'that's the way to speak; cry\r\nout lustily, make thyself well heard, so it may seem true.' Quoth\r\nCalandrino, 'Thou wouldst make me give my soul to the Fiend! I tell\r\nthee and thou believest me not. May I be strung up by the neck an it\r\nhave not been stolen from me!' 'Good lack!' cried Bruno. 'How can that\r\nbe? I saw it here but yesterday. Thinkest thou to make me believe that\r\nit hath flown away?' Quoth Calandrino, 'It is as I tell thee.' 'Good\r\nlack,' repeated Bruno, 'can it be?' 'Certes,' replied Calandrino, 'it\r\nis so, more by token that I am undone and know not how I shall return\r\nhome. My wife will never believe me; or even if she do, I shall have\r\nno peace with her this year to come.' Quoth Bruno, 'So God save me,\r\nthis is ill done, if it be true; but thou knowest, Calandrino, I\r\nlessoned thee yesterday to say thus and I would not have thee at once\r\ncozen thy wife and us.' Therewithal Calandrino fell to crying out and\r\nsaying, 'Alack, why will you drive me to desperation and make me\r\nblaspheme God and the Saints? I tell you the pig was stolen from me\r\nyesternight.'\r\n\r\nThen said Buffalmacco, 'If it be so indeed, we must cast about for a\r\nmeans of having it again, an we may contrive it.' 'But what means,'\r\nasked Calandrino, 'can we find?' Quoth Buffalmacco, 'We may be sure\r\nthat there hath come none from the Indies to rob thee of thy pig; the\r\nthief must have been some one of thy neighbors. An thou canst make\r\nshift to assemble them, I know how to work the ordeal by bread and\r\ncheese and we will presently see for certain who hath had it.' 'Ay,'\r\nput in Bruno, 'thou wouldst make a fine thing of bread and cheese with\r\nsuch gentry as we have about here, for one of them I am certain hath\r\nhad the pig, and he would smoke the trap and would not come.' 'How,\r\nthen, shall we do?' asked Buffalmacco, and Bruno said, 'We must e'en\r\ndo it with ginger boluses and good vernage[383] and invite them to\r\ndrink. They will suspect nothing and come, and the ginger boluses can\r\nbe blessed even as the bread and cheese.' Quoth Buffalmacco, 'Indeed,\r\nthou sayst sooth. What sayst thou, Calandrino? Shall's do 't?' 'Nay,'\r\nreplied the gull, 'I pray you thereof for the love of God; for, did I\r\nbut know who hath had it, I should hold myself half consoled.' 'Marry,\r\nthen,' said Bruno, 'I am ready to go to Florence, to oblige thee, for\r\nthe things aforesaid, so thou wilt give me the money.' Now Calandrino\r\nhad maybe forty shillings, which he gave him, and Bruno accordingly\r\nrepaired to Florence to a friend of his, a druggist, of whom he bought\r\na pound of fine ginger boluses and caused compound a couple of\r\ndogballs with fresh confect of hepatic aloes; after which he let cover\r\nthese latter with sugar, like the others, and set thereon a privy mark\r\nby which he might very well know them, so he should not mistake them\r\nnor change them. Then, buying a flask of good vernage, he returned to\r\nCalandrino in the country and said to him, 'Do thou to-morrow morning\r\ninvite those whom thou suspectest to drink with thee; it is a holiday\r\nand all will willingly come. Meanwhile, Buffalmacco and I will\r\nto-night make the conjuration over the pills and bring them to thee\r\nto-morrow morning at home; and for the love of thee I will administer\r\nthem myself and do and say that which is to be said and done.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 383: _i.e._ white wine, see p. 372, note.]\r\n\r\nCalandrino did as he said and assembled on the following morning a\r\ngoodly company of such young Florentines as were presently about the\r\nvillage and of husbandmen; whereupon Bruno and Buffalmacco came with a\r\nbox of pills and the flask of wine and made the folk stand in a ring.\r\nThen said Bruno, 'Gentlemen, needs must I tell you the reason\r\nwherefore you are here, so that, if aught betide that please you not,\r\nyou may have no cause to complain of me. Calandrino here was robbed\r\nyesternight of a fine pig, nor can he find who hath had it; and for\r\nthat none other than some one of us who are here can have stolen it\r\nfrom him, he proffereth each of you, that he may discover who hath had\r\nit, one of these pills to eat and a draught of wine. Now you must know\r\nthat he who hath had the pig will not be able to swallow the pill;\r\nnay, it will seem to him more bitter than poison and he will spit it\r\nout; wherefore, rather than that shame be done him in the presence of\r\nso many, he were better tell it to the parson by way of confession and\r\nI will proceed no farther with this matter.'\r\n\r\nAll who were there declared that they would willingly eat of the\r\npills, whereupon Bruno ranged them in order and set Calandrino among\r\nthem; then, beginning at one end of the line, he proceeded to give\r\neach his bolus, and whenas he came over against Calandrino, he took\r\none of the dogballs and put it into his hand. Calandrino clapped it\r\nincontinent into his mouth and began to chew it; but no sooner did his\r\ntongue taste the aloes, than he spat it out again, being unable to\r\nbrook the bitterness. Meanwhile, each was looking other in the face,\r\nto see who should spit out his bolus, and whilst Bruno, not having\r\nmade an end of serving them out, went on to do so, feigning to pay no\r\nheed to Calandrino's doing, he heard say behind him, 'How now,\r\nCalandrino? What meaneth this?' Whereupon he turned suddenly round and\r\nseeing that Calandrino had spat out his bolus, said, 'Stay, maybe\r\nsomewhat else hath caused him spit it out. Take another of them.'\r\nThen, taking the other dogball, he thrust it into Calandrino's mouth\r\nand went on to finish giving out the rest. If the first ball seemed\r\nbitter to Calandrino, the second was bitterer yet; but, being ashamed\r\nto spit it out, he kept it awhile in his mouth, chewing it and\r\nshedding tears that seemed hazel-nuts so big they were, till at last,\r\nunable to hold out longer, he cast it forth, like as he had the first.\r\nMeanwhile Buffalmacco and Bruno gave the company to drink, and all,\r\nseeing this, declared that Calandrino had certainly stolen the pig\r\nfrom himself; nay, there were those there who rated him roundly.\r\n\r\nAfter they were all gone, and the two rogues left alone with\r\nCalandrino, Buffalmacco said to him, 'I still had it for certain that\r\nit was thou tookst the pig thyself and wouldst fain make us believe\r\nthat it had been stolen from thee, to escape giving us one poor while\r\nto drink of the monies thou hadst for it.' Calandrino, who was not yet\r\nquit of the bitter taste of the aloes, began to swear that he had not\r\nhad it, and Buffalmacco said, 'But in good earnest, comrade, what\r\ngottest thou for it? Was it six florins?' Calandrino, hearing this,\r\nbegan to wax desperate, and Bruno said, 'Harkye, Calandrino, there was\r\nsuch an one in the company that ate and drank with us, who told me\r\nthat thou hast a wench over yonder, whom thou keepest for thy pleasure\r\nand to whom thou givest whatsoever thou canst scrape together, and\r\nthat he held it for certain that thou hadst sent her the pig. Thou\r\nhast learned of late to play pranks of this kind; thou carriedst us\r\noff t'other day down the Mugnone, picking up black stones, and whenas\r\nthou hadst gotten us aboard ship without biscuit,[384] thou madest off\r\nand wouldst after have us believe that thou hadst found the magic\r\nstone; and now on like wise thou thinkest, by dint of oaths, to make\r\nus believe that the pig, which thou hast given away or more like sold,\r\nhath been stolen from thee. But we are used to thy tricks and know\r\nthem; thou shalt not avail to play us any more of them, and to be\r\nplain with thee, since we have been at pains to make the conjuration,\r\nwe mean that thou shalt give us two pairs of capons; else will we\r\ntell Mistress Tessa everything.' Calandrino, seeing that he was not\r\nbelieved and himseeming he had had vexation enough, without having his\r\nwife's scolding into the bargain, gave them two pairs of capons, which\r\nthey carried off to Florence, after they had salted the pig, leaving\r\nCalandrino to digest the loss and the flouting as best he might.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 384: _i.e._ embarked on a bootless quest.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Eighth]\r\n\r\n     A SCHOLAR LOVETH A WIDOW LADY, WHO, BEING ENAMOURED OF\r\n     ANOTHER, CAUSETH HIM SPEND ONE WINTER'S NIGHT IN THE SNOW\r\n     AWAITING HER, AND HE AFTER CONTRIVETH, BY HIS SLEIGHT, TO\r\n     HAVE HER ABIDE NAKED, ALL ONE MID-JULY DAY, ON THE SUMMIT OF\r\n     A TOWER, EXPOSED TO FLIES AND GADS AND SUN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ladies laughed amain at the unhappy Calandrino and would have\r\nlaughed yet more, but that it irked them to see him fleeced of the\r\ncapons, to boot, by those who had already robbed him of the pig. But,\r\nas soon as the end of the story was come, the queen charged Pampinea\r\ntell hers, and she promptly began thus: \"It chanceth oft, dearest\r\nladies, that craft is put to scorn by craft and it is therefore a sign\r\nof little wit to delight in making mock of others. We have, for\r\nseveral stories, laughed amain at tricks that have been played upon\r\nfolk and whereof no vengeance is recorded to have been taken; but I\r\npurpose now to cause you have some compassion of a just retribution\r\nwreaked upon a townswoman of ours, on whose head her own cheat\r\nrecoiled and was retorted well nigh unto death; and the hearing of\r\nthis will not be without profit unto you, for that henceforward you\r\nwill the better keep yourselves from making mock of others, and in\r\nthis you will show great good sense.\r\n\r\nNot many years ago there was in Florence, a young lady, by name Elena,\r\nfair of favour and haughty of humour, of very gentle lineage and\r\nendowed with sufficient abundance of the goods of fortune, who, being\r\nwidowed of her husband, chose never to marry again, for that she was\r\nenamoured of a handsome and agreeable youth of her own choice, and\r\nwith the aid of a maid of hers, in whom she put great trust, being\r\nquit of every other care, she often with marvellous delight gave\r\nherself a good time with him. In these days it chanced that a young\r\ngentleman of our city, by name Rinieri, having long studied in Paris,\r\nnot for the sake of after selling his knowledge by retail, as many do,\r\nbut to know the nature of things and their causes, the which\r\nexcellently becometh a gentleman, returned thence to Florence and\r\nthere lived citizen-fashion, much honoured as well for his nobility as\r\nfor his learning. But, as it chanceth often that those, who have the\r\nmost experience of things profound, are the soonest snared of love,\r\neven so it befell this Rinieri; for, having one day repaired, by way\r\nof diversion, to an entertainment, there presented herself before his\r\neyes the aforesaid Elena, clad all in black, as our widows go, and\r\nfull, to his judgment, of such beauty and pleasantness as himseemed he\r\nhad never beheld in any other woman; and in his heart he deemed that\r\nhe might call himself blest whom God should vouchsafe to hold her\r\nnaked in his arms. Then, furtively considering her once and again and\r\nknowing that great things and precious were not to be acquired without\r\ntravail, he altogether determined in himself to devote all his pains\r\nand all his diligence to the pleasing her, to the end that thereby he\r\nmight gain her love and so avail to have his fill of her.\r\n\r\nThe young lady, (who kept not her eyes fixed upon the nether world,\r\nbut, conceiting herself as much and more than as much as she was,\r\nmoved them artfully hither and thither, gazing all about, and was\r\nquick to note who delighted to look upon her,) soon became aware of\r\nRinieri and said, laughing, in herself, 'I have not come hither in\r\nvain to-day; for, an I mistake not, I have caught a woodcock by the\r\nbill.' Accordingly, she fell to ogling him from time to time with the\r\ntail of her eye and studied, inasmuch as she might, to let him see\r\nthat she took note of him, thinking that the more men she allured and\r\nensnared with her charms, so much the more of price would her beauty\r\nbe, especially to him on whom she had bestowed it, together with her\r\nlove. The learned scholar, laying aside philosophical speculations,\r\nturned all his thoughts to her and thinking to please her, enquired\r\nwhere she lived and proceeded to pass to and fro before her house,\r\ncolouring his comings and goings with various pretexts, whilst the\r\nlady, idly glorying in this, for the reason already set out, made\r\nbelieve to take great pleasure in seeing him. Accordingly, he found\r\nmeans to clap up an acquaintance with her maid and discovering to her\r\nhis love, prayed her make interest for him with her mistress, so he\r\nmight avail to have her favour. The maid promised freely and told the\r\nlady, who hearkened with the heartiest laughter in the world and said,\r\n'Seest thou where yonder man cometh to lose the wit he hath brought\r\nback from Paris? Marry, we will give him that which he goeth seeking.\r\nAn he bespeak thee again, do thou tell him that I love him far more\r\nthan he loveth me; but that it behoveth me look to mine honour, so I\r\nmay hold up my head with the other ladies; whereof and he be as wise\r\nas folk say, he will hold me so much the dearer.' Alack, poor silly\r\nsoul, she knew not aright, ladies mine, what it is to try conclusions\r\nwith scholars. The maid went in search of Rinieri and finding him, did\r\nthat which had been enjoined her of her mistress, whereat he was\r\noverjoyed and proceeded to use more urgent entreaties, writing letters\r\nand sending presents, all of which were accepted, but he got nothing\r\nbut vague and general answers; and on this wise she held him in play a\r\ngreat while.\r\n\r\nAt last, to show her lover, to whom she had discovered everything and\r\nwho was whiles somewhat vexed with her for this and had conceived some\r\njealousy of Rinieri, that he did wrong to suspect her thereof, she\r\ndespatched to the scholar, now grown very pressing, her maid, who told\r\nhim, on her mistress's part, that she had never yet had an opportunity\r\nto do aught that might pleasure him since he had certified her of his\r\nlove, but that on the occasion of the festival of the Nativity she\r\nhoped to be able to be with him; wherefore, an it liked him, he was\r\non the evening of the feast to come by night to her courtyard, whither\r\nshe would go for him as first she might. At this the scholar was the\r\ngladdest man alive and betook himself at the appointed time to his\r\nmistress's house, where he was carried by the maid into a courtyard\r\nand being there locked in, proceeded to wait the lady's coming. The\r\nlatter had that evening sent for her lover and after she had supped\r\nmerrily with him, she told him that which she purposed to do that\r\nnight, adding, 'And thou mayst see for thyself what and how great is\r\nthe love I have borne and bear him of whom thou hast taken a\r\njealousy.' The lover heard these words with great satisfaction and was\r\nimpatient to see by the fact that which the lady gave him to\r\nunderstand with words.\r\n\r\nIt had by chance snowed hard during the day and everything was covered\r\nwith snow, wherefore the scholar had not long abidden in the courtyard\r\nbefore he began to feel colder than he could have wished; but, looking\r\nto recruit himself speedily, he was fain to endure it with patience.\r\nPresently, the lady said to her lover, 'Let us go look from a lattice\r\nwhat yonder fellow, of whom thou art waxed jealous, doth and hear what\r\nhe shall answer the maid, whom I have sent to parley with him.'\r\nAccordingly, they betook themselves to a lattice and thence, seeing,\r\nwithout being seen, they heard the maid from another lattice bespeak\r\nthe scholar and say, 'Rinieri, my lady is the woefullest woman that\r\nwas aye, for that there is one of her brothers come hither to-night,\r\nwho hath talked much with her and after must needs sup with her, nor\r\nis yet gone away; but methinketh he will soon be gone; wherefore she\r\nhath not been able to come to thee, but will soon come now and prayeth\r\nthee not to take the waiting in ill part.' Rinieri, believing this to\r\nbe true, replied, 'Tell my lady to give herself no concern for me till\r\nsuch time as she can at her commodity come to me, but bid her do this\r\nas quickliest she may.' The maid turned back into the house and betook\r\nherself to bed, whilst the lady said to her gallant, 'Well, how sayst\r\nthou? Thinkest thou that, an I wished him such weal as thou fearest, I\r\nwould suffer him stand a-freezing down yonder?' So saying, she betook\r\nherself to bed with her lover, who was now in part satisfied, and\r\nthere they abode a great while in joyance and liesse, laughing and\r\nmaking mock of the wretched scholar, who fared to and fro the while in\r\nthe courtyard, making shift to warm himself with exercise, nor had\r\nwhereas he might seat himself or shelter from the night-damp. He\r\ncursed her brother's long stay with the lady and took everything he\r\nheard for the opening of a door to him by her, but hoped in vain.\r\n\r\nThe lady, having solaced herself with her lover till near upon\r\nmidnight, said to him, 'How deemest thou, my soul, of our scholar?\r\nWhether seemeth to thee the greater, his wit or the love I bear him?\r\nWill the cold which I presently cause him suffer do away from thy mind\r\nthe doubts which my pleasantries aroused therein the other day?'\r\nWhereto he replied, 'Heart of my body, yes, I know right well that,\r\nlike as thou art my good and my peace and my delight and all my hope,\r\neven so am I thine.' 'Then,' rejoined she, 'kiss me a thousand times,\r\nso I may see if thou say sooth.' Whereupon he clipped her fast in his\r\narms and kissed her not a thousand, but more than an hundred thousand\r\ntimes. Then, after they had abidden awhile in such discourse, the lady\r\nsaid, 'Marry, let us arise a little and go see if the fire is anydele\r\nspent, wherein this my new lover wrote me that he burnt all day long.'\r\nAccordingly, they arose and getting them to the accustomed lattice,\r\nlooked out into the courtyard, where they saw the scholar dancing a\r\nright merry jig on the snow, so fast and brisk that never had they\r\nseen the like, to the sound of the chattering of the teeth that he\r\nmade for excess of cold; whereupon quoth the lady, 'How sayst thou,\r\nsweet my hope? Seemeth to thee that I know how to make folk jig it\r\nwithout sound of trump or bagpipe?' Whereto he answered, laughing, 'Ay\r\ndost thou, my chief delight.' Quoth the lady, 'I will that we go down\r\nto the door; thou shalt abide quiet, whilst I bespeak him, and we\r\nshall hear what he will say; belike we shall have no less diversion\r\nthereof than we had from seeing him.'\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they softly opened the chamber and stole down to the\r\ndoor, where, without opening it anydele, the lady called to the\r\nscholar in a low voice by a little hole that was there. Rinieri\r\nhearing himself called, praised God, taking it oversoon for granted\r\nthat he was to be presently admitted, and coming up to the door, said,\r\n'Here am I, madam; open for God's sake, for I die of cold.' 'O ay,'\r\nreplied the lady, 'I know thou art a chilly one; is then the cold so\r\nexceeding great, because, forsooth, there is a little snow about? I\r\nwot the nights are much colder in Paris. I cannot open to thee yet,\r\nfor that accursed brother of mine, who came to sup with me to-night,\r\nis not yet gone; but he will soon begone and I will come incontinent\r\nto open to thee. I have but now very hardly stolen away from him, that\r\nI might come to exhort thee not to wax weary of waiting.' 'Alack,\r\nmadam,' cried the scholar, 'I pray you for God's sake open to me, so I\r\nmay abide within under cover, for that this little while past there is\r\ncome on the thickest snow in the world and it yet snoweth, and I will\r\nwait for you as long as it shall please you.' 'Woe's me, sweet my\r\ntreasure,' replied the lady, 'that cannot I; for this door maketh so\r\ngreat a noise, whenas it is opened, that it would lightly be heard of\r\nmy brother, if I should open to thee; but I will go bid him begone, so\r\nI may after come back and open to thee.' 'Then go quickly,' rejoined\r\nhe; 'and I prithee let make a good fire, so I may warm me as soon as I\r\ncome in, for that I am grown so cold I can scarce feel myself.' Quoth\r\nthe lady, 'That should not be possible, an that be true which thou\r\nhast many a time written me, to wit, that thou burnest for the love of\r\nme. Now, I must go, wait and be of good heart.' Then, with her lover,\r\nwho had heard all this with the utmost pleasure, she went back to bed,\r\nand that night they slept little, nay, they spent it well nigh all in\r\ndalliance and delight and in making mock of Rinieri.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the unhappy scholar (now well nigh grown a stork, so sore\r\ndid his teeth chatter,) perceiving at last that he was befooled,\r\nessayed again and again to open the door and sought an he might not\r\navail to issue thence by another way; but, finding no means\r\nthereunto, he fell a-ranging to and fro like a lion, cursing the\r\nfoulness of the weather and the lady's malignity and the length of the\r\nnight, together with his own credulity; wherefore, being sore despited\r\nagainst his mistress, the long and ardent love he had borne her was\r\nsuddenly changed to fierce and bitter hatred and he revolved in\r\nhimself many and various things, so he might find a means of revenge,\r\nthe which he now desired far more eagerly than he had before desired\r\nto be with the lady. At last, after much long tarriance, the night\r\ndrew near unto day and the dawn began to appear; whereupon the maid,\r\nwho had been lessoned by the lady, coming down, opened the courtyard\r\ndoor and feigning to have compassion of Rinieri, said, 'Bad luck may\r\nhe have who came hither yestereve! He hath kept us all night upon\r\nthorns and hath caused thee freeze; but knowest thou what? Bear it\r\nwith patience, for that which could not be to-night shall be another\r\ntime. Indeed, I know nought could have happened that had been so\r\ndispleasing to my lady.'\r\n\r\nThe despiteful scholar, like a wise man as he was, who knew that\r\nthreats are but arms for the threatened, locked up in his breast that\r\nwhich untempered will would fain have vented and said in a low voice,\r\nwithout anywise showing himself vexed, 'In truth I have had the worst\r\nnight I ever had; but I have well apprehended that the lady is nowise\r\nto blame for this, inasmuch as she herself of her compassion for me,\r\ncame down hither to excuse herself and to hearten me; and as thou\r\nsayest, that which hath not been to-night shall be another time.\r\nCommend me to her and God be with thee.' Therewithal, well nigh stark\r\nwith cold, he made his way, as best he might, back to his house,\r\nwhere, being drowsed to death, he cast himself upon his bed to sleep\r\nand awoke well nigh crippled of his arms and legs; wherefore, sending\r\nfor sundry physicians and acquainting them with the cold he had\r\nsuffered, he caused take order for his cure. The leaches, plying him\r\nwith prompt and very potent remedies, hardly, after some time, availed\r\nto recover him of the shrinking of the sinews and cause them relax;\r\nand but that he was young and that the warm season came on, he had\r\novermuch to suffer. However, being restored to health and lustihead,\r\nhe kept his hate to himself and feigned himself more than ever\r\nenamoured of his widow.\r\n\r\nNow it befell, after a certain space of time, that fortune furnished\r\nhim with an occasion of satisfying his desire [for vengeance], for\r\nthat the youth beloved of the widow being, without any regard for the\r\nlove she bore him, fallen enamoured of another lady, would have nor\r\nlittle nor much to say to her nor do aught to pleasure her, wherefore\r\nshe pined in tears and bitterness. But her maid, who had great\r\ncompassion of her, finding no way of rousing her mistress from the\r\nchagrin into which the loss of her lover had cast her and seeing the\r\nscholar pass along the street, after the wonted manner, entered into a\r\nfond conceit, to wit, that the lady's lover might be brought by some\r\nnecromantic operation or other to love her as he had been wont to do\r\nand that the scholar should be a past master in this manner of thing,\r\nand told her thought to her mistress. The latter, little wise, without\r\nconsidering that, had the scholar been acquainted with the black art,\r\nhe would have practised it for himself, lent her mind to her maid's\r\nwords and bade her forthright learn from him if he would do it and\r\ngive him all assurance that, in requital thereof, she would do\r\nwhatsoever pleased him. The maid did her errand well and diligently,\r\nwhich when the scholar heard, he was overjoyed and said in himself,\r\n'Praised be Thou, my God! The time is come when with Thine aid I may\r\navail to make yonder wicked woman pay the penalty of the harm she did\r\nme in requital of the great love I bore her.' Then to the maid, 'Tell\r\nmy lady,' quoth he, 'that she need be in no concern for this, for\r\nthat, were her lover in the Indies, I would speedily cause him come to\r\nher and crave pardon of that which he hath done to displeasure her;\r\nbut the means she must take to this end I purpose to impart to\r\nherself, when and where it shall most please her. So say to her and\r\nhearten her on my part.'\r\n\r\nThe maid carried his answer to her mistress and it was agreed that\r\nthey should foregather at Santa Lucia del Prato, whither, accordingly,\r\nthe lady, and the scholar being come and speaking together alone, she,\r\nremembering her not that she had aforetime brought him well nigh to\r\ndeath's door, openly discovered to him her case and that which she\r\ndesired and besought him to succour her. 'Madam,' answered he, 'it is\r\ntrue that amongst the other things I learned at Paris was necromancy,\r\nwhereof for certain I know that which is extant thereof; but for that\r\nthe thing is supremely displeasing unto God, I had sworn never to\r\npractise it either for myself or for others. Nevertheless, the love I\r\nbear you is of such potency that I know not how I may deny you aught\r\nthat you would have me do; wherefore, though it should behove me for\r\nthis alone go to the devil's stead, I am yet ready to do it, since it\r\nis your pleasure. But I must forewarn you that the thing is more\r\nuneath to do than you perchance imagine, especially whenas a woman\r\nwould recall a man to loving her or a man a woman, for that this\r\ncannot be done save by the very person unto whom it pertaineth; and it\r\nbehoveth that whoso doth it be of an assured mind, seeing it must be\r\ndone anights and in solitary places without company; which things I\r\nknow not how you are disposed to do.' The lady, more enamoured than\r\ndiscreet, replied, 'Love spurreth me on such wise that there is\r\nnothing I would not do to have again him who hath wrongfully forsaken\r\nme. Algates, an it please you, show me in what I must approve myself\r\nassured of mind.' 'Madam,' replied the scholar, who had a patch of ill\r\nhair to his tail,[385] 'I must make an image of pewter in his name\r\nwhom you desire to get again, which whenas I shall send you, it will\r\nbehove you seven times bathe yourself therewith, all naked, in a\r\nrunning stream, at the hour of the first sleep, what time the moon is\r\nfar on the wane. Thereafter, naked as you are, you must get you up\r\ninto a tree or to the top of some uninhabited house and turning to the\r\nnorth, with the image in your hand, seven times running say certain\r\nwords which I shall give you written; which when you shall have done,\r\nthere will come to you two of the fairest damsels you ever beheld, who\r\nwill salute you and ask you courteously what you would have done. Do\r\nyou well and throughly discover to them your desires and look it\r\nbetide you not to name one for another. As soon as you have told them,\r\nthey will depart and you may then come down to the place where you\r\nshall have left your clothes and re-clothe yourself and return home;\r\nand for certain, ere it be the middle of the ensuing night, your lover\r\nwill come, weeping, to crave you pardon and mercy; and know that from\r\nthat time forth he will never again leave you for any other.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 385: A proverbial way of saying that he bore malice and was\r\nvindictive.]\r\n\r\nThe lady, hearing all this and lending entire faith thereto, was half\r\ncomforted, herseeming she already had her lover again in her arms, and\r\nsaid, 'Never fear; I will very well do these things, and I have\r\ntherefor the finest commodity in the world; for I have, towards the\r\nupper end of the Val d'Arno, a farm, which is very near the\r\nriver-bank, and it is now July, so that bathing will be pleasant; more\r\nby token that I mind me there is, not far from the stream, a little\r\nuninhabited tower, save that the shepherds climb up bytimes, by a\r\nladder of chestnut-wood that is there, to a sollar at the top, to look\r\nfor their strayed beasts: otherwise it is a very solitary\r\nout-of-the-way[386] place. Thither will I betake myself and there I\r\nhope to do that which you shall enjoin me the best in the world.' The\r\nscholar, who very well knew both the place and the tower mentioned by\r\nthe lady, was rejoiced to be certified of her intent and said, 'Madam,\r\nI was never in these part and therefore know neither the farm nor the\r\ntower; but, an it be as you say, nothing in the world can be better.\r\nWherefore, whenas it shall be time, I will send you the image and the\r\nconjuration; but I pray you instantly, whenas you shall have gotten\r\nyour desire and shall know I have served you well, that you be mindful\r\nof me and remember to keep your promise to me.' She answered that she\r\nwould without fail do it and taking leave of him, returned to her\r\nhouse; whilst the scholar, rejoiced for that himseemed his desire was\r\nlike to have effect, made an image with certain talismanic characters\r\nof his own devising, and wrote a rigmarole of his fashion, by way of\r\nconjuration; the which, whenas it seemed to him time, he despatched to\r\nthe lady and sent to tell her that she must that very night, without\r\nmore tarriance, do that which he had enjoined her; after which he\r\nsecretly betook himself, with a servant of his, to the house of one of\r\nhis friends who abode very near the tower, so he might give effect to\r\nhis design.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 386: Lit. out of hand (_fuor di mano_).]\r\n\r\nThe lady, on her part, set out with her maid and repaired to her farm,\r\nwhere, as soon as the night was come, she made a show of going to bed\r\nand sent the maid away to sleep, but towards the hour of the first\r\nsleep, she issued quietly forth of the house and betook herself to the\r\nbank of the Arno hard by the tower, where, looking first well all\r\nabout and seeing nor hearing any, she put off her clothes and hiding\r\nthem under a bush, bathed seven times with the image; after which,\r\nnaked as she was, she made for the tower, image in hand. The scholar,\r\nwho had, at the coming on of the night, hidden himself with his\r\nservant among the willows and other trees near the tower and had\r\nwitnessed all this, seeing her, as she passed thus naked close to\r\nhim, overcome the darkness of the night with the whiteness of her body\r\nand after considering her breast and the other parts of her person and\r\nseeing them fair, bethought himself what they should become in a\r\nlittle while and felt some compassion of her; whilst, on the other\r\nhand, the pricks of the flesh assailed him of a sudden and caused that\r\nstand on end which erst lay prone, inciting him to issue forth of his\r\nambush and go take her and do his will of her. Between the one and the\r\nother he was like to be overcome; but, calling to mind who he was and\r\nwhat the injury he had suffered and wherefore and at whose hands and\r\nhe being thereby rekindled in despite and compassion and carnal\r\nappetite banished, he abode firm in his purpose and let her go.\r\n\r\nThe lady, going up on to the tower and turning to the north, began to\r\nrepeat the words given her by the scholar, who, coming quietly into\r\nthe tower awhile after, little by little removed the ladder, which led\r\nto the sollar where she was, and after awaited that which she should\r\ndo and say. Meanwhile, the lady, having seven times said her\r\nconjuration, began to look for the two damsels and so long was her\r\nwaiting (more by token that she felt it cooler than she could have\r\nwished) that she saw the dawn appear; whereupon, woeful that it had\r\nnot befallen as the scholar had told her, she said in herself, 'I fear\r\nme yonder man hath had a mind to give me a night such as that which I\r\ngave him; but, an that be his intent, he hath ill known to avenge\r\nhimself, for that this night hath not been as long by a third as was\r\nhis, forbye that the cold was of anothergates sort.' Then, so the day\r\nmight not surprise her there, she proceeded to seek to go down from\r\nthe tower, but found the ladder gone; whereupon her courage forsook\r\nher, as it were the world had failed beneath her feet, and she fell\r\ndown aswoon upon the platform of the tower. As soon as her sense\r\nreturned to her, she fell to weeping piteously and bemoaning herself,\r\nand perceiving but too well that this must have been the scholar's\r\ndoing, she went on to blame herself for having affronted others and\r\nafter for having overmuch trusted in him whom she had good reason to\r\nbelieve her enemy; and on this wise she abode a great while. Then,\r\nlooking if there were no way of descending and seeing none, she fell\r\nagain to her lamentation and gave herself up to bitter thought, saying\r\nin herself, 'Alas, unhappy woman! What will be said of thy brothers\r\nand kinsfolk and neighbours and generally of all the people of\r\nFlorence, when it shall be known that thou has been found here naked?\r\nThy repute, that hath hitherto been so great, will be known to have\r\nbeen false; and shouldst thou seek to frame lying excuses for thyself,\r\n(if indeed there are any to be found) the accursed scholar, who\r\nknoweth all thine affairs, will not suffer thee lie. Oh wretched\r\nwoman, that wilt at one stroke have lost the youth so ill-fatedly\r\nbeloved and thine own honour!'\r\n\r\nTherewithal she fell into such a passion of woe that she was like to\r\ncast herself down from the tower to the ground; but, the sun being now\r\nrisen and she drawing near to one side of the walls of the tower, to\r\nlook if any boy should pass with cattle, whom she might send for her\r\nmaid, it chanced that the scholar, who had slept awhile at the foot\r\nof a bush, awaking, saw her and she him; whereupon quoth he to her,\r\n'Good day, madam; are the damsels come yet?' The lady, seeing and\r\nhearing him, began afresh to weep sore and besought him to come within\r\nthe tower, so she might speak with him. In this he was courteous\r\nenough to comply with her and she laying herself prone on the platform\r\nand showing only her head at the opening, said, weeping, 'Assuredly,\r\nRinieri, if I gave thee an ill night, thou hast well avenged thyself\r\nof me, for that, albeit it is July, I have thought to freeze this\r\nnight, naked as I am, more by token that I have so sore bewept both\r\nthe trick I put upon thee and mine own folly in believing thee that it\r\nis a wonder I have any eyes left in my head. Wherefore I entreat thee,\r\nnot for the love of me, whom thou hast no call to love, but for the\r\nlove of thyself, who are a gentleman, that thou be content, for\r\nvengeance of the injury I did thee, with that which thou hast already\r\ndone and cause fetch me my clothes and suffer me come down hence, nor\r\nseek to take from me that which thou couldst not after restore me, an\r\nthou wouldst, to wit, my honour; for, if I took from thee the being\r\nwith me that night, I can render thee many nights for that one,\r\nwhenassoever it liketh thee. Let this, then, suffice and let it\r\ncontent thee, as a man of honour, to have availed to avenge thyself\r\nand to have caused me confess it. Seek not to use thy strength against\r\na woman; no glory is it for an eagle to have overcome a dove,\r\nwherefore, for the love of God and thine own honour, have pity on me.'\r\n\r\nThe scholar, with stern mind revolving in himself the injury suffered\r\nand seeing her weep and beseech, felt at once both pleasure and annoy;\r\npleasure in the revenge which he had desired more than aught else, and\r\nannoy he felt, for that his humanity moved him to compassion of the\r\nunhappy woman. However, humanity availing not to overcome the\r\nfierceness of his appetite [for vengeance], 'Madam Elena,' answered\r\nhe, 'if my prayers (which, it is true, I knew not to bathe with tears\r\nnor to make honeyed, as thou presently knowest to proffer thine,) had\r\navailed, the night when I was dying of cold in thy snow-filled\r\ncourtyard, to procure me to be put of thee but a little under cover,\r\nit were a light matter to me to hearken now unto thine; but, if thou\r\nbe presently so much more concerned for thine honour than in the past\r\nand it be grievous to thee to abide up there naked, address these thy\r\nprayers to him in whose arms thou didst not scruple, that night which\r\nthou thyself recallest, to abide naked, hearing me the while go about\r\nthy courtyard, chattering with my teeth and trampling the snow, and\r\nget thee succour of him; cause him fetch thee thy clothes and set thee\r\nthe ladder, whereby thou mayest descend, and study to inform him with\r\ntenderness for thine honour, the which thou hast not scrupled both now\r\nand a thousand other times to imperil for him. Why dost thou not call\r\nhim to come help thee? To whom pertaineth it more than unto him? Thou\r\nart his; and what should he regard or succour, an he regard not\r\nneither succour thee? Call him, silly woman that thou art, and prove\r\nif the love thou bearest him and thy wits and his together can avail\r\nto deliver thee from my folly, whereof, dallying with him the while,\r\nthou questionedst aforetime whether himseemed the greater, my folly or\r\nthe love thou borest him.[387] Thou canst not now be lavish to me of\r\nthat which I desire not, nor couldst thou deny it to me, an I desired\r\nit; keep thy nights for thy lover, an it chance that thou come off\r\nhence alive; be they thine and his. I had overmuch of one of them and\r\nit sufficeth me to have been once befooled. Again, using thy craft and\r\nwiliness in speech, thou studiest, by extolling me, to gain my\r\ngoodwill and callest me a gentleman and a man of honour, thinking thus\r\nto cajole me into playing the magnanimous and forebearing to punish\r\nthee for thy wickedness; but thy blandishments shall not now darken me\r\nthe eyes of the understanding, as did thy disloyal promises whilere. I\r\nknow myself, nor did I learn so much of myself what while I sojourned\r\nat Paris as thou taughtest me in one single night of thine. But,\r\ngranted I were indeed magnanimous, thou art none of those towards whom\r\nmagnanimity should be shown; the issue of punishment, as likewise of\r\nvengeance, in the case of wild beasts such as thou art, behoveth to be\r\ndeath, whereas for human beings that should suffice whereof thou\r\nspeakest. Wherefore, albeit I am no eagle, knowing thee to be no dove,\r\nbut a venomous serpent, I mean to pursue thee, as an immemorial enemy,\r\nwith every hate and all my might, albeit this that I do to thee can\r\nscarce properly be styled vengeance, but rather chastisement, inasmuch\r\nas vengeance should overpass the offence and this will not attain\r\nthereto; for that, an I sought to avenge myself, considering to what a\r\npass thou broughtest my soul, thy life, should I take it from thee,\r\nwould not suffice me, no, nor the lives of an hundred others such as\r\nthou, since, slaying thee, I should but slay a vile, wicked and\r\nworthless trull of a woman. And what a devil more account (setting\r\naside this thy scantling of fair favour,[388] which a few years will\r\nmar, filling it with wrinkles,) art thou than whatsoever other sorry\r\nserving-drab? Whereas it was no fault of thine that thou failedst of\r\ncausing the death of a man of honour, as thou styledst me but now,\r\nwhose life may yet in one day be of more service to the world than an\r\nhundred thousand of thy like could be what while the world endureth. I\r\nwill teach thee, then, by means of this annoy that thou sufferest,\r\nwhat it is to flout men of sense, and particularly scholars, and will\r\ngive thee cause never more, an thou comest off alive, to fall into\r\nsuch a folly. But, an thou have so great a wish to descend, why dost\r\nthou not cast thyself down? On this wise, with God's help, thou wilt,\r\nby breaking thy neck, at once deliver thyself from the torment,\r\nwherein it seemeth to thee thou art, and make me the joyfullest man in\r\nthe world. Now, I have no more to say to thee. I knew to contrive on\r\nsuch wise that I caused thee go up thither; do thou now contrive to\r\ncome down thence, even as thou knewest to befool me.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 387: Boccaccio here misquotes himself. See p. 389, where the\r\nlady says to her lover, \"Whether seemeth to thee the greater, his wit\r\nor the love I bear him?\" This is only one of the numberless instances\r\nof negligence and inconsistency which occur in the Decameron and which\r\nmake it evident to the student that it must have passed into the hands\r\nof the public without the final revision and correction by the author,\r\nthat _limæ labor_ without which no book is complete and which is\r\nespecially necessary in the case of such a work as the present, where\r\nBoccaccio figures as the virtual creator of Italian prose.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 388: Lit. face, aspect (_viso_).]\r\n\r\nWhat while the scholar spoke thus, the wretched lady wept without\r\nceasing and the time lapsed by, the sun still rising high and higher;\r\nbut, when she saw that he was silent, she said, 'Alack, cruel man, if\r\nthe accursed night was so grievous to thee and if my default seem to\r\nthee so heinous a thing that neither my young beauty nor my bitter\r\ntears and humble prayers may avail to move thee to any pity, at least\r\nlet this act of mine alone some little move thee and abate the rigour\r\nof thy rancour, to wit, that I but now trusted in thee and discovered\r\nto thee mine every secret, opening withal to thy desire a way whereby\r\nthou mightest avail to make me cognizant of my sin; more by token\r\nthat, except I had trusted in thee, thou hadst had no means of\r\navailing to take of me that vengeance, which thou seemest to have so\r\nardently desired. For God's sake, leave thine anger and pardon me\r\nhenceforth; I am ready, so thou wilt but forgive me and bring me down\r\nhence, altogether to renounce yonder faithless youth and to have thee\r\nalone to lover and lord, albeit thou decriest my beauty, avouching it\r\nshort-lived and little worth; natheless, whatever it be, compared with\r\nthat of other women, yet this I know, that, if for nought else, it is\r\nto be prized for that it is the desire and pastime and delight of\r\nmen's youth, and thou art not old. And albeit I am cruelly entreated\r\nof thee, I cannot believe withal that thou wouldst fain see me die so\r\nunseemly a death as were the casting myself down from this tower, as\r\nin desperation, before thine eyes, wherein, an thou was not a liar as\r\nthou are since become, I was erst so pleasing. Alack, have ruth on me\r\nfor God's sake and pity's! The sun beginneth to wax hot, and like as\r\nthe overmuch cold irked me this night, even so doth the heat begin to\r\ndo me sore annoy.'\r\n\r\nThe scholar, who held her in parley for his diversion, answered,\r\n'Madam, thou hast not presently trusted thine honour in my hands for\r\nany love that thou borest me, but to regain him whom thou hast lost,\r\nwherefore it meriteth but greater severity, and if thou think that\r\nthis way alone was apt and opportune unto the vengeance desired of me,\r\nthou thinkest foolishly; I had a thousand others; nay, whilst feigning\r\nto love thee, I had spread a thousand snares about thy feet, and it\r\nwould not have been long, had this not chanced, ere thou must of\r\nnecessity have fallen into one of them, nor couldst thou have fallen\r\ninto any but it had caused thee greater torment and shame than this\r\npresent, the which I took, not to ease thee, but to be the quicklier\r\nsatisfied. And though all else should have failed me, the pen had\r\nstill been left me, wherewithal I would have written such and so many\r\nthings of thee and after such a fashion that, whenas thou camest (as\r\nthou wouldst have come) to know of them, thou wouldst a thousand times\r\na day have wished thyself never born. The power of the pen is far\r\ngreater than they imagine who have not proved it with experience. I\r\nswear to God (so may He gladden me to the end of this vengeance that I\r\ntake of thee, even as He hath made me glad thereof in the beginning!)\r\nthat I would have written such things of thee, that, being ashamed,\r\nnot to say before other folk, but before thine own self, thou shouldst\r\nhave put out thine own eyes, not to see thyself in the glass;\r\nwherefore let not the little rivulet twit the sea with having caused\r\nit wax. Of thy love or that thou be mine, I reck not, as I have\r\nalready said, a jot; be thou e'en his, an thou may, whose thou wast\r\nerst and whom, as I once hated, so at this present I love, having\r\nregard unto that which he hath wrought towards thee of late. You women\r\ngo falling enamoured of young springalds and covet their love, for\r\nthat you see them somewhat fresher of colour and blacker of beard and\r\nthey go erect and jaunty and dance and joust, all which things they\r\nhave had who are somewhat more in years, ay, and these know that which\r\nthose have yet to learn. Moreover, you hold them better cavaliers and\r\ndeem that they fare more miles in a day than men of riper age. Certes,\r\nI confess that they jumble a wench's furbelows more briskly; but those\r\nmore in years, being men of experience, know better where the fleas\r\nstick, and little meat and savoury is far and away rather to be chosen\r\nthan much and insipid, more by token that hard trotting undoth and\r\nwearieth folk, how young soever they be, whereas easy going, though\r\nbelike it bring one somewhat later to the inn, at the least carrieth\r\nhim thither unfatigued. You women perceive not, animals without\r\nunderstanding that you are, how much ill lieth hid under this\r\nscantling of fair seeming. Young fellows are not content with one\r\nwoman; nay, as many as they see, so many do they covet and of so many\r\nthemseemeth they are worthy; wherefore their love cannot be stable,\r\nand of this thou mayst presently of thine own experience bear very\r\ntrue witness. Themseemeth they are worthy to be worshipped and\r\ncaressed of their mistresses and they have no greater glory than to\r\nvaunt them of those whom they have had; the which default of theirs\r\nhath aforetime cast many a woman into the arms of the monks, who tell\r\nno tales. Albeit thou sayst that never did any know of thine amours,\r\nsave thy maid and myself, thou knowest it ill and believest awry, an\r\nthou think thus. His[389] quarter talketh well nigh of nothing else,\r\nand thine likewise; but most times the last to whose ears such things\r\ncome is he to whom they pertain. Young men, to boot, despoil you,\r\nwhereas it is given you[390] of men of riper years. Since, then, thou\r\nhast ill chosen, be thou his to whom thou gavest thyself and leave me,\r\nof whom thou madest mock, to others, for that I have found a mistress\r\nof much more account than thou, who hath been wise enough to know me\r\nbetter than thou didst. And that thou mayst carry into the other world\r\ngreater assurance of the desire of mine eyes than meseemeth thou\r\ngatherest from my words, do but cast thyself down forthright and thy\r\nsoul, being, as I doubt not it will be, straightway received into the\r\narms of the devil, will be able to see if mine eyes be troubled or not\r\nat seeing thee fall headlong. But, as medoubteth thou wilt not consent\r\nto do me so much pleasure, I counsel thee, if the sun begin to scorch\r\nthee, remember thee of the cold thou madest me suffer, which an thou\r\nmingle with the heat aforesaid, thou wilt without fail feel the sun\r\nattempered.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 389: _i.e._ thy lover's.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 390: _V'è donato_, _i.e._ young lovers look to receive gifts\r\nof their mistresses, whilst those of more mature age bestow them.]\r\n\r\nThe disconsolate lady, seeing that the scholar's words tended to a\r\ncruel end, fell again to weeping and said, 'Harkye, since nothing I\r\ncan say availeth to move thee to pity of me, let the love move thee,\r\nwhich thou bearest that lady whom thou hast found wiser than I and of\r\nwhom thou sayst thou art beloved, and for the love of her pardon me\r\nand fetch me my clothes, so I may dress myself, and cause me descend\r\nhence.' Therewith the scholar began to laugh and seeing that tierce\r\nwas now passed by a good hour, replied, 'Marry, I know not how to say\r\nthee nay, since thou conjurest me by such a lady; tell me where thy\r\nclothes are and I will go for them and help thee come down from up\r\nyonder.' The lady, believing this, was somewhat comforted and showed\r\nhim where she had laid her clothes; whereupon he went forth of the\r\ntower and bidding his servant not depart thence, but abide near at\r\nhand and watch as most he might that none should enter there till such\r\ntime as he should return, went off to his friend's house, where he\r\ndined at his ease and after, whenas himseemed time, betook himself to\r\nsleep; whilst the lady, left upon the tower, albeit some little\r\nheartened with fond hope, natheless beyond measure woebegone, sat up\r\nand creeping close to that part of the wall where there was a little\r\nshade, fell a-waiting, in company of very bitter thoughts. There she\r\nabode, now hoping and now despairing of the scholar's return with her\r\nclothes, and passing from one thought to another, she presently fell\r\nasleep, as one who was overcome of dolour and who had slept no whit\r\nthe past night.\r\n\r\nThe sun, which was exceeding hot, being now risen to the meridian,\r\nbeat full and straight upon her tender and delicate body and upon her\r\nhead, which was all uncovered, with such force that not only did it\r\nburn her flesh, wherever it touched it, but cracked and opened it all\r\nover little by little, and such was the pain of the burning that it\r\nconstrained her to awake, albeit she slept fast. Feeling herself on\r\nthe roast and moving somewhat, it seemed as if all her scorched skin\r\ncracked and clove asunder for the motion, as we see happen with a\r\nscorched sheepskin, if any stretch it, and to boot her head irked her\r\nso sore that it seemed it would burst, which was no wonder. And the\r\nplatform of the tower was so burning hot that she could find no\r\nrestingplace there either for her feet or for otherwhat; wherefore,\r\nwithout standing fast, she still removed now hither and now thither,\r\nweeping. Moreover, there being not a breath of wind, the flies and\r\ngads flocked thither in swarms and settling upon her cracked flesh,\r\nstung her so cruelly that each prick seemed to her a pike-stab;\r\nwherefore she stinted not to fling her hands about, still cursing\r\nherself, her life, her lover and the scholar.\r\n\r\nBeing thus by the inexpressible heat of the sun, by the flies and the\r\ngads and likewise by hunger, but much more by thirst, and by a\r\nthousand irksome thoughts, to boot, tortured and stung and pierced to\r\nthe quick, she started to her feet and addressed herself to look if\r\nshe might see or hear any one near at hand, resolved, whatever might\r\nbetide thereof, to call him and crave aid. But of this resource also\r\nhad her unfriendly fortune deprived her. The husbandmen were all\r\ndeparted from the fields for the heat, more by token that none had\r\ncome that day to work therenigh, they being all engaged in threshing\r\nout their sheaves beside their houses; wherefore she heard nought but\r\ncrickets and saw the Arno, which latter sight, provoking in her desire\r\nof its waters, abated not her thirst, but rather increased it. In\r\nseveral places also she saw thickets and shady places and houses here\r\nand there, which were all alike to her an anguish for desire of them.\r\nWhat more shall we say of the ill-starred lady? The sun overhead and\r\nthe heat of the platform underfoot and the stings of the flies and\r\ngads on every side had so entreated her that, whereas with her\r\nwhiteness she had overcome the darkness of the foregoing night, she\r\nwas presently grown red as ruddle,[391] and all bescabbed as she was\r\nwith blood, had seemed to whoso saw her the foulest thing in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 391: Lit. red as rabies (_rabbia_). Some commentators\r\nsuppose that Boccaccio meant to write _robbia_, madder.]\r\n\r\nAs she abode on this wise, without aught of hope or counsel,[392]\r\nexpecting death more than otherwhat, it being now past half none, the\r\nscholar, arising from sleep and remembering him of his mistress,\r\nreturned to the tower, to see what was come of her, and sent his\r\nservant, who was yet fasting, to eat. The lady, hearing him, came, all\r\nweak and anguishful as she was for the grievous annoy she had\r\nsuffered, overagainst the trap-door and seating herself there, began,\r\nweeping, to say, 'Indeed, Rinieri, thou hast beyond measure avenged\r\nthyself, for, if I made thee freeze in my courtyard by night, thou\r\nhast made me roast, nay burn, on this tower by day and die of hunger\r\nand thirst to boot; wherefore I pray thee by the One only God that\r\nthou come up hither and since my heart suffereth me not give myself\r\ndeath with mine own hands, give it me thou, for that I desire it more\r\nthan aught else, such and so great are the torments I endure. Or, an\r\nthou wilt not do me that favour, let bring me, at the least, a cup of\r\nwater, so I may wet my mouth, whereunto my tears suffice not; so sore\r\nis the drouth and the burning that I have therein.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 392: _i.e._ resource (_consiglio_). See ante, passim.]\r\n\r\nThe scholar knew her weakness by her voice and eke saw, in part, her\r\nbody all burnt up of the sun; wherefore and for her humble prayers\r\nthere overcame him a little compassion of her; but none the less he\r\nanswered, 'Wicked woman, thou shalt not die by my hands; nay, by thine\r\nown shalt thou die, an thou have a mind thereto; and thou shalt have\r\nof me as much water for the allaying of thy heat as I had fire of thee\r\nfor the comforting of my cold. This much I sore regret that, whereas\r\nit behoved me heal the infirmity of my cold with the heat of stinking\r\ndung, that of thy heat will be healed with the coolth of odoriferous\r\nrose-water; and whereas I was like to lose both limbs and life, thou,\r\nflayed by this heat, wilt abide fair none otherwise than doth the\r\nsnake, casting its old skin.' 'Alack, wretch that I am,' cried the\r\nlady, 'God give beauties on such wise acquired to those who wish me\r\nill! But thou, that are more cruel than any wild beast, how couldst\r\nthou have the heart to torture me after this fashion? What more could\r\nI expect from thee or any other, if I had done all thy kinsfolk to\r\ndeath with the cruellest torments? Certes, meknoweth not what greater\r\ncruelty could be wreaked upon a traitor who had brought a whole city\r\nto slaughter than that whereto thou hast exposed me in causing me to\r\nbe roasted of the sun and devoured of the flies and withal denying me\r\na cup of water, whenas to murderers condemned of justice is\r\noftentimes, as they go to their death, given to drink of wine, so but\r\nthey ask it. Nay, since I see thee abide firm in thy savage cruelty\r\nand that my sufferance availeth not anywise to move thee, I will\r\nresign myself with patience to receive death, so God, whom I beseech\r\nto look with equitable eyes upon this thy dealing, may have mercy upon\r\nmy soul.'\r\n\r\nSo saying, she dragged herself painfully to the midward of the\r\nplatform, despairing to escape alive from so fierce a heat; and not\r\nonce, but a thousand times, over and above her other torments, she\r\nthought to swoon for thirst, still weeping and bemoaning her illhap.\r\nHowever, it being now vespers and it seeming to the scholar he had\r\ndone enough, he caused his servant take up the unhappy lady's clothes\r\nand wrap them in his cloak; then, betaking himself to her house, he\r\nfound her maid seated before the door, sad and disconsolate and\r\nunknowing what to do, and said to her, 'Good woman, what is come of\r\nthy mistress?' 'Sir,' replied she, 'I know not. I thought to find her\r\nthis morning in the bed whither meseemed I saw her betake herself\r\nyesternight; but I can find her neither there nor otherwhere and know\r\nnot what is come of her; wherefore I suffer the utmost concern. But\r\nyou, sir, can you not tell me aught of her?' Quoth he, 'Would I had\r\nhad thee together with her whereas I have had her, so I might have\r\npunished thee of thy default, like as I have punished her for hers!\r\nBut assuredly thou shalt not escape from my hands, ere I have so paid\r\nthee for thy dealings that thou shalt never more make mock of any man,\r\nwithout remembering thee of me.' Then to his servant, 'Give her the\r\nclothes,' quoth he, 'and bid her go to her mistress, an she will.' The\r\nman did his bidding and gave the clothes to the maid, who, knowing\r\nthem and hearing what Rinieri said, was sore afraid lest they should\r\nhave slain her mistress and scarce refrained from crying out; then,\r\nthe scholar being done, she set out with the clothes for the tower,\r\nweeping the while.\r\n\r\nNow it chanced that one of the lady's husbandmen had that day lost two\r\nof his swine and going in search of them, came, a little after the\r\nscholar's departure, to the tower. As he went spying about everywhere\r\nif he should see his hogs, he heard the piteous lamentation made of\r\nthe miserable lady and climbing up as most he might, cried out, 'Who\r\nmaketh moan there aloft?' The lady knew her husbandman's voice and\r\ncalling him by name, said to him, 'For God's sake, fetch me my maid\r\nand contrive so she may come up hither to me.' Whereupon quoth the\r\nman, recognizing her, 'Alack, madam, who hath brought you up yonder?\r\nYour maid hath gone seeking you all day; but who had ever thought you\r\ncould be here?' Then, taking the ladder-poles, he set them up in their\r\nplace and addressed himself to bind the cross-staves thereto with\r\nwithy bands.[393] Meanwhile, up came the maid, who no sooner entered\r\nthe tower than, unable any longer to hold her tongue, she fell to\r\ncrying out, buffeting herself the while with her hands, 'Alack, sweet\r\nmy lady, where are you?' The lady, hearing her, answered as loudliest\r\nshe might, 'O sister mine, I am here aloft. Weep not, but fetch me my\r\nclothes quickly.' When the maid heard her speak, she was in a manner\r\nall recomforted and with the husbandman's aid, mounting the ladder,\r\nwhich was now well nigh repaired, reached the sollar, where, whenas\r\nshe saw her lady lying naked on the ground, all forspent and wan, more\r\nas she were a half-burnt log than a human being, she thrust her nails\r\ninto her own face and fell a-weeping over her, no otherwise than as\r\nshe had been dead.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 393: Boccaccio appears to have forgotten to mention that\r\nRinieri had broken the rounds of the ladder, when he withdrew it (as\r\nstated, p. 394), apparently to place an additional obstacle in the way\r\nof the lady's escape.]\r\n\r\nThe lady besought her for God's sake be silent and help her dress\r\nherself, and learning from her that none knew where she had been save\r\nthose who had carried her the clothes and the husbandman there\r\npresent, was somewhat comforted and prayed them for God's sake never\r\nto say aught of the matter to any one. Then, after much parley, the\r\nhusbandman, taking the lady in his arms, for that she could not walk,\r\nbrought her safely without the tower; but the unlucky maid, who had\r\nremained behind, descending less circumspectly, made a slip of the\r\nfoot and falling from the ladder to the ground, broke her thigh,\r\nwhereupon she fell a-roaring for the pain, that it seemed a lion. The\r\nhusbandman, setting the lady down on a plot of grass, went to see what\r\nailed the maid and finding her with her thigh broken, carried her also\r\nto the grass-plat and laid her beside her mistress, who, seeing this\r\nbefallen in addition to her other troubles and that she had broken her\r\nthigh by whom she looked to have been succoured more than by any else,\r\nwas beyond measure woebegone and fell a-weeping afresh and so\r\npiteously that not only could the husbandman not avail to comfort her,\r\nbut himself fell a-weeping like wise. But presently, the sun being now\r\nlow, he repaired, at the instance of the disconsolate lady, lest the\r\nnight should overtake them there, to his own house, and there called\r\nhis wife and two brothers of his, who returned to the tower with a\r\nplank and setting the maid thereon, carried her home, whilst he\r\nhimself, having comforted the lady with a little cold water and kind\r\nwords, took her up in his arms and brought her to her own chamber.\r\n\r\nHis wife gave her a wine-sop to eat and after, undressing her, put her\r\nto bed; and they contrived that night to have her and her maid carried\r\nto Florence. There, the lady, who had shifts and devices great plenty,\r\nframed a story of her fashion, altogether out of conformity with that\r\nwhich had passed, and gave her brothers and sisters and every one else\r\nto believe that this had befallen herself and her maid by dint of\r\ndiabolical bewitchments. Physicians were quickly at hand, who, not\r\nwithout putting her to very great anguish and vexation, recovered the\r\nlady of a sore fever, after she had once and again left her skin\r\nsticking to the sheets, and on like wise healed the maid of her broken\r\nthigh. Wherefore, forgetting her lover, from that time forth she\r\ndiscreetly forbore both from making mock of others and from loving,\r\nwhilst the scholar, hearing that the maid had broken her thigh, held\r\nhimself fully avenged and passed on, content, without saying otherwhat\r\nthereof. Thus, then, did it befall the foolish young lady of her\r\npranks, for that she thought to fool it with a scholar as she would\r\nhave done with another, unknowing that scholars,--I will not say all,\r\nbut the most part of them,--know where the devil keepeth his tail.\r\nWherefore, ladies, beware of making mock of folk, and especially of\r\nscholars.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Eighth]\r\n\r\n     TWO MEN CONSORTING TOGETHER, ONE LIETH WITH THE WIFE OF HIS\r\n     COMRADE, WHO, BECOMING AWARE THEREOF, DOTH WITH HER ON SUCH\r\n     WISE THAT THE OTHER IS SHUT UP IN A CHEST, UPON WHICH HE\r\n     LIETH WITH HIS WIFE, HE BEING INSIDE THE WHILE\r\n\r\n\r\nElena's troubles had been irksome and grievous to the ladies to hear;\r\nnatheless, for that they deemed them in part justly befallen her, they\r\npassed them over with more moderate compassion, albeit they held the\r\nscholar to have been terribly stern and obdurate, nay, cruel. But,\r\nPampinea being now come to the end of her story, the queen charged\r\nFiammetta follow on, who, nothing loath to obey, said, \"Charming\r\nladies, for that meseemeth the severity of the offended scholar hath\r\nsomedele distressed you, I deem it well to solace your ruffled spirits\r\nwith somewhat more diverting; wherefore I purpose to tell you a little\r\nstory of a young man who received an injury in a milder spirit and\r\navenged it after a more moderate fashion, by which you may understand\r\nthat, whenas a man goeth about to avenge an injury suffered, it should\r\nsuffice him to give as good as he hath gotten, without seeking to do\r\nhurt overpassing the behoof of the feud.\r\n\r\nYou must know, then, that there were once in Siena, as I have\r\nunderstood aforetime, two young men in easy enough case and of good\r\ncity families, whereof one was named Spinelloccio Tanena and the other\r\nZeppa di Mino, and they were next-door neighbours in Camollia.[394]\r\nThese two young men still companied together and loved each other, to\r\nall appearance, as they had been brothers, or better; and each of them\r\nhad a very fair wife. It chanced that Spinelloccio, by dint of much\r\nfrequenting Zeppa's house, both when the latter was at home and when\r\nhe was abroad, grew so private with his wife that he ended by lying\r\nwith her, and on this wise they abode a pretty while, before any\r\nbecame aware thereof. However, at last, one day, Zeppa being at home,\r\nunknown to his wife, Spinelloccio came to call him and the lady said\r\nthat he was abroad; whereupon the other came straightway up into the\r\nhouse and finding her in the saloon and seeing none else there, he\r\ntook her in his arms and fell to kissing her and she him. Zeppa, who\r\nsaw this, made no sign, but abode hidden to see in what the game\r\nshould result and presently saw his wife and Spinelloccio betake\r\nthemselves, thus embraced, to a chamber and there lock themselves in;\r\nwhereat he was sore angered. But, knowing that his injury would not\r\nbecome less for making an outcry nor for otherwhat, nay, that shame\r\nwould but wax therefor, he set himself to think what revenge he should\r\ntake thereof, so his soul might abide content, without the thing being\r\nknown all about, and himseeming, after long consideration, he had\r\nfound the means, he abode hidden so long as Spinelloccio remained with\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 394: _Quære_, the street of that name?]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the other was gone away, he entered the chamber and there\r\nfinding the lady, who had not yet made an end of adjusting her\r\nhead-veils, which Spinelloccio had plucked down in dallying with her,\r\nsaid to her, 'Wife, what dost thou?' Quoth she, 'Seest thou not?' And\r\nZeppa answered, 'Ay, indeed, I have seen more than I could wish.' So\r\nsaying, he taxed her with that which had passed and she, in sore\r\naffright, confessed to him, after much parley, that which she could\r\nnot aptly deny of her familiarity with Spinelloccio. Then she began to\r\ncrave him pardon, weeping, and Zeppa said to her, 'Harkye, wife, thou\r\nhast done ill, and if thou wilt have me pardon it to thee, bethink\r\nthee punctually to do that which I shall enjoin thee, which is this; I\r\nwill have thee bid Spinelloccio find an occasion to part company with\r\nme to-morrow morning, towards tierce, and come hither to thee. When he\r\nis here I will come back and so soon as thou hearest me, do thou make\r\nhim enter this chest here and lock him therein. Then, when thou shalt\r\nhave done this, I will tell thee what else thou shalt do; and have\r\nthou no fear of doing this, for that I promise thee I will do him no\r\nmanner of hurt.' The lady, to satisfy him, promised to do his bidding,\r\nand so she did.\r\n\r\nThe morrow come and Zeppa and Spinelloccio being together towards\r\ntierce, the latter, who had promised the lady to be with her at that\r\nhour, said to the former, 'I am to dine this morning with a friend,\r\nwhom I would not keep waiting for me; wherefore God be with thee.'\r\nQuoth Zeppa, 'It is not dinner-time yet awhile'; but Spinelloccio\r\nanswered, 'No matter; I am to speak with him also of an affair of\r\nmine, so that needs must I be there betimes.' Accordingly, taking\r\nleave of him, he fetched a compass and making for Zeppa's house,\r\nentered a chamber with the latter's wife. He had not been there long\r\nere Zeppa returned, whom when the lady heard, feigning to be mightily\r\naffrighted, she made him take refuge in the chest, as her husband had\r\nbidden her, and locking him therein, went forth of the chamber. Zeppa,\r\ncoming up, said, 'Wife, is it dinner-time?' 'Ay,' answered she,\r\n'forthright.' Quoth he, 'Spinelloccio is gone to dine this morning\r\nwith a friend of his and hath left his wife alone; get thee to the\r\nwindow and call her and bid her come dine with us.' The lady, fearing\r\nfor herself and grown therefor mighty obedient, did as he bade her and\r\nSpinelloccio's wife, being much pressed by her and hearing that her\r\nown husband was to dine abroad, came hither.\r\n\r\nZeppa made much of her and whispering his wife begone into the\r\nkitchen, took her familiarly by the hand and carried her into the\r\nchamber, wherein no sooner were they come than, turning back, he\r\nlocked the door within. When the lady saw him do this, she said,\r\n'Alack, Zeppa, what meaneth this? Have you then brought me hither for\r\nthis? Is this the love you bear Spinelloccio and the loyal\r\ncompanionship you practise towards him?' Whereupon quoth Zeppa,\r\ndrawing near to the chest wherein was her husband locked up and\r\nholding her fast, 'Madam, ere thou complainest, hearken to that which\r\nI have to say to thee. I have loved and love Spinelloccio as a\r\nbrother, and yesterday, albeit he knoweth it not, I found that the\r\ntrust I had in him was come to this, that he lieth with my wife even\r\nas with thee. Now, for that I love him, I purpose not to take\r\nvengeance of him, save on such wise as the offence hath been; he hath\r\nhad my wife and I mean to have thee. An thou wilt not, needs must I\r\ntake him here and for that I mean not to let this affront go\r\nunpunished, I will play him such a turn that neither thou nor he shall\r\never again be glad.' The lady, hearing this and believing what Zeppa\r\nsaid, after many affirmations made her of him, replied, 'Zeppa mine,\r\nsince this vengeance is to fall on me, I am content, so but thou wilt\r\ncontrive, notwithstanding what we are to do, that I may abide at peace\r\nwith thy wife, even as I intend to abide with her, notwithstanding\r\nthis that she hath done to me.' 'Assuredly,' rejoined Zeppa, 'I will\r\ndo it; and to boot, I will give thee a precious and fine jewel as none\r\nother thou hast.' So saying, he embraced her; then, laying her flat on\r\nthe chest, there to his heart's content, he solaced himself with her,\r\nand she with him.\r\n\r\nSpinelloccio, hearing from within the chest all that Zeppa said his\r\nwife's answer and feeling the morrisdance[395] that was toward over\r\nhis head, was at first so sore despited that himseemed he should die;\r\nand but that he stood in fear of Zeppa, he had rated his wife finely,\r\nshut up as he was. However, bethinking himself that the offence had\r\nbegun with him and that Zeppa was in his right to do as he did and had\r\nindeed borne himself towards him humanely and like a comrade, he\r\npresently resolved in himself to be, an he would, more than ever his\r\nfriend. Zeppa, having been with the lady so long as it pleased him,\r\ndismounted from the chest, and she asking for the promised jewel, he\r\nopened the chamber-door and called his wife, who said nought else than\r\n'Madam, you have given me a loaf for my bannock'; and this she said\r\nlaughing. To her quoth Zeppa, 'Open this chest.' Accordingly she\r\nopened it and therein Zeppa showed the lady her husband, saying, 'Here\r\nis the jewel I promised thee.' It were hard to say which was the more\r\nabashed of the twain, Spinelloccio, seeing Zeppa and knowing that he\r\nknew what he had done, or his wife, seeing her husband and knowing\r\nthat he had both heard and felt that which she had done over his head.\r\nBut Spinelloccio, coming forth of the chest, said, without more\r\nparley, 'Zeppa, we are quits; wherefore it is well, as thou saidst but\r\nnow to my wife, that we be still friends as we were, and that, since\r\nthere is nothing unshared between us two but our wives, we have these\r\nalso in common.' Zeppa was content and they all four dined together in\r\nthe utmost possible harmony; and thenceforward each of the two ladies\r\nhad two husbands and each of the latter two wives, without ever having\r\nany strife or grudge anent the matter.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 395: _Danza trivigiana_, lit. Trevisan dance, O.E. the\r\nshaking of the sheets.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NINTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Eighth]\r\n\r\n     MASTER SIMONE THE PHYSICIAN, HAVING BEEN INDUCED BY BRUNO\r\n     AND BUFFALMACCO TO REPAIR TO A CERTAIN PLACE BY NIGHT, THERE\r\n     TO BE MADE A MEMBER OF A COMPANY THAT GOETH A-ROVING, IS\r\n     CAST BY BUFFALMACCO INTO A TRENCH FULL OF ORDURE AND THERE\r\n     LEFT\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the ladies had chatted awhile over the community of wives\r\npractised by the two Siennese, the queen, with whom alone it rested to\r\ntell, so she would not do Dioneo an unright, began on this wise:\r\n\"Right well, lovesome ladies, did Spinelloccio deserve the cheat put\r\nupon him by Zeppa; wherefore meseemeth he is not severely to be blamed\r\n(as Pampinea sought awhile ago to show), who putteth a cheat on those\r\nwho go seeking it or deserve it. Now Spinelloccio deserved it, and I\r\nmean to tell you of one who went seeking it for himself. Those who\r\ntricked him, I hold not to be blameworthy, but rather commendable, and\r\nhe to whom it was done was a physician, who, having set out for\r\nBologna a sheepshead, returned to Florence all covered with\r\nminiver.[396]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 396: _i.e._ with the doctor's hood of miniver.]\r\n\r\nAs we see daily, our townsmen return hither from Bologna, this a\r\njudge, that a physician and a third a notary, tricked out with robes\r\nlong and large and scarlets and minivers and store of other fine\r\nparaphernalia, and make a mighty brave show, to which how far the\r\neffects conform we may still see all day long. Among the rest a\r\ncertain Master Simone da Villa, richer in inherited goods than in\r\nlearning, returned hither, no great while since, a doctor of medicine,\r\naccording to his own account, clad all in scarlet[397] and with a\r\ngreat miniver hood, and took a house in the street which we call\r\nnowadays the Via del Cocomero. This said Master Simone, being thus\r\nnewly returned, as hath been said, had, amongst other his notable\r\ncustoms, a trick of asking whosoever was with him who was no matter\r\nwhat man he saw pass in the street, and as if of the doings and\r\nfashions of men he should compound the medicines he gave his\r\npatients, he took note of all and laid them all up in his memory.\r\nAmongst others on whom it occurred to him more particularly to cast\r\nhis eyes were two painters of whom it hath already twice to-day been\r\ndiscoursed, namely, Bruno and Buffalmacco, who were neighbours of his\r\nand still went in company. Himseeming they recked less of the world\r\nand lived more merrily than other folk, as was indeed the case, he\r\nquestioned divers persons of their condition and hearing from all that\r\nthey were poor men and painters, he took it into his head that it\r\nmight not be they lived so blithely of their poverty, but concluded,\r\nfor that he had heard they were shrewd fellows, that they must needs\r\nderive very great profits from some source unknown to the general;\r\nwherefore he was taken with a desire to clap up an acquaintance, an he\r\nmight, with them both, or at least with one of them, and succeeded in\r\nmaking friends with Bruno. The latter, perceiving, after he had been\r\nwith him a few times, that the physician was a very jackass, began to\r\ngive himself the finest time in the world with him and to be hugely\r\ndiverted with his extraordinary humours, whilst Master Simone in like\r\nmanner took a marvellous delight in his company.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 397: The colour of the doctors' robes of that time.]\r\n\r\nAfter a while, having sundry times bidden him to dinner and thinking\r\nhimself entitled in consequence to discourse familiarly with him, he\r\ndiscovered to him the wonderment that he felt at him and Buffalmacco,\r\nhow, being poor men, they lived so merrily, and besought him to\r\napprise him how they did. Bruno, hearing this talk from the physician\r\nand himseeing the question was one of his wonted witless\r\nimpertinences, fell a-laughing in his sleeve, and bethinking himself\r\nto answer him according as his folly deserved, said, 'Doctor, there\r\nare not many whom I would tell how we do; but you I shall not scruple\r\nto tell, for that you are a friend and I know you will not repeat it\r\nto any. It is true we live, my friend and I, as merrily and as well as\r\nit appeareth to you, nay, more so, albeit neither of our craft nor of\r\nrevenues we derive from any possessions might we have enough to pay\r\nfor the very water we consume. Yet I would not, for all that, have you\r\nthink that we go steal; nay, we go a-roving, and thence, without hurt\r\nunto any, we get us all to which we have a mind or for which we have\r\noccasion; hence the merry life you see us lead.'\r\n\r\nThe physician, hearing this and believing it, without knowing what it\r\nwas, marvelled exceedingly and forthright conceiving an ardent desire\r\nto know what manner of thing this going a-roving might be, besought\r\nhim very urgently to tell him, affirming that he would assuredly never\r\ndiscover it to any. 'Alack, doctor,' cried Bruno, 'what is this you\r\nask me? This you would know is too great a secret and a thing to undo\r\nme and drive me from the world, nay, to bring me into the mouth of the\r\nLucifer of San Gallo,[398] should any come to know it. But so great is\r\nthe love I bear your right worshipful pumpkinheadship of Legnaja[399]\r\nand the confidence I have in you that I can deny you nothing you\r\nwould have; wherefore I will tell it you, on condition that you swear\r\nto me by the cross at Montesone, never, as you have promised, to tell\r\nit to any one.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 398: The commentators note here that on the church door of\r\nSan Gallo was depicted an especially frightful Lucifer, with many\r\nmouths.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 399: Legnaja is said to be famous for big pumpkins.]\r\n\r\nThe physician declared that he would never repeat what he should tell\r\nhim, and Bruno said, 'You must know, then, honey doctor mine, that not\r\nlong since there was in this city a great master in necromancy, who\r\nwas called Michael Scott, for that he was of Scotland, and who\r\nreceived the greatest hospitality from many gentlemen, of whom few are\r\nnowadays alive; wherefore, being minded to depart hence, he left them,\r\nat their instant prayers, two of his ablest disciples, whom he\r\nenjoined still to hold themselves in readiness to satisfy every wish\r\nof the gentlemen who had so worshipfully entertained him. These two,\r\nthen, freely served the aforesaid gentlemen in certain amours of\r\ntheirs and other small matters, and afterward, the city and the usages\r\nof the folk pleasing them, they determined to abide there always.\r\nAccordingly, they contracted great and strait friendship with certain\r\nof the townfolk, regarding not who they were, whether gentle or\r\nsimple, rich or poor, but solely if they were men comfortable to their\r\nown usances; and to pleasure these who were thus become their friends,\r\nthey founded a company of maybe five-and-twenty men, who should\r\nforegather twice at the least in the month in some place appointed of\r\nthem, where being assembled, each should tell them his desire, which\r\nthey would forthright accomplish unto him for that night. Buffalmacco\r\nand I, having an especial friendship and intimacy with these two, were\r\nput of them on the roll of the aforesaid company and are still\r\nthereof. And I may tell you that, what time it chanceth that we\r\nassemble together, it is a marvellous thing to see the hangings about\r\nthe saloon where we eat and the tables spread on royal wise and the\r\nmultitude of noble and goodly servants, as well female as male, at the\r\npleasure of each one who is of the company, and the basons and ewers\r\nand flagons and goblets and the vessels of gold and silver, wherein we\r\neat and drink, more by token of the many and various viands that are\r\nset before us, each in its season, according to that which each one\r\ndesireth. I could never avail to set out to you what and how many are\r\nthe sweet sounds of innumerable instruments and the songs full of\r\nmelody that are heard there; nor might I tell you how much wax is\r\nburned at these suppers nor what and how many are the confections that\r\nare consumed there nor how costly are the wines that are drunken. But\r\nI would not have you believe, good saltless pumpkinhead mine, that we\r\nabide there in this habit and with these clothes that you see us wear\r\nevery day; nay, there is none of us of so little account but would\r\nseem to you an emperor, so richly are we adorned with vestments of\r\nprice and fine things. But, over all the other pleasures that be there\r\nis that of fair ladies, who, so one but will it, are incontinent\r\nbrought thither from the four quarters of the world. There might you\r\nsee the Sovereign Lady of the Rascal-Roughs, the Queen of the Basques,\r\nthe wife of the Soldan, the Empress of the Usbeg Tartars, the\r\nDriggledraggletail of Norroway, the Moll-a-green of Flapdoodleland and\r\nthe Madkate of Woolgathergreen. But why need I enumerate them to you?\r\nThere be all the queens in the world, even, I may say, to the\r\nSirreverence of Prester John, who hath his horns amiddleward his arse;\r\nsee you now? There, after we have drunken and eaten confections and\r\nwalked a dance or two, each lady betaketh herself to her bedchamber\r\nwith him at whose instance she hath been brought thither. And you must\r\nknow that these bedchambers are a very paradise to behold, so goodly\r\nthey are; ay, and they are no less odoriferous than are the\r\nspice-boxes of your shop, whenas you let bray cummin-seed, and therein\r\nare beds that would seem to you goodlier than that of the Doge of\r\nVenice, and in these they betake themselves to rest. Marry, what a\r\nworking of the treadles, what a hauling-to of the battens to make the\r\ncloth close, these weaveresses keep up, I will e'en leave you to\r\nimagine; but of those who fare best, to my seeming, are Buffalmacco\r\nand myself, for that he most times letteth come thither the Queen of\r\nFrance for himself, whilst I send for her of England, the which are\r\ntwo of the fairest ladies in the world, and we have known so to do\r\nthat they have none other eye in their head than us.[400] Wherefore\r\nyou may judge for yourself if we can and should live and go more\r\nmerrily than other men, seeing we have the love of two such queens,\r\nmore by token that, whenas we would have a thousand or two thousand\r\nflorins of them, we get them not. This, then, we commonly style going\r\na-roving, for that, like as the rovers take every man's good, even so\r\ndo we, save that we are in this much different from them that they\r\nnever restore that which they take, whereas we return it again, whenas\r\nwe have used it. Now, worthy doctor mine, you have heard what it is we\r\ncall going a-roving; but how strictly this requireth to be kept secret\r\nyou can see for yourself, and therefore I say no more to you nor pray\r\nyou thereof.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 400: _i.e._ they think of and cherish us alone, holding us\r\nas dear as their very eyes.]\r\n\r\nThe physician, whose science reached no farther belike than the curing\r\nchildren of the scald-head, gave as much credit to Bruno's story as\r\nhad been due to the most manifest truth and was inflamed with as great\r\ndesire to be received into that company as might be kindled in any for\r\nthe most desirable thing in the world; wherefore he made answer to him\r\nthat assuredly it was no marvel if they went merry and hardly\r\nconstrained himself to defer requesting him to bring him to be there\r\nuntil such time as, having done him further hospitality, he might with\r\nmore confidence proffer his request to him. Accordingly, reserving\r\nthis unto a more favourable season, he proceeded to keep straiter\r\nusance with Bruno, having him morning and evening to eat with him and\r\nshowing him an inordinate affection; and indeed so great and so\r\nconstant was this their commerce that it seemed as if the physician\r\ncould not nor knew how to live without the painter. The latter,\r\nfinding himself in good case, so he might not appear ungrateful for\r\nthe hospitality shown him, had painted Master Simone a picture of Lent\r\nin his saloon, besides an Agnus Dei at the entering in of his chamber\r\nand a chamber-pot over the street-door, so those who had occasion for\r\nhis advice might know how to distinguish him from the others; and in\r\na little gallery he had, he had depictured him the battle of the rats\r\nand the cats, which appeared to the physician a very fine thing.\r\nMoreover, he said whiles to him, whenas he had not supper with him\r\novernight, 'I was at the society yesternight and being a trifle tired\r\nof the Queen of England, I caused fetch me the Dolladoxy of the Grand\r\nCham of Tartary.' 'What meaneth Dolladoxy?' asked Master Simone. 'I do\r\nnot understand these names.' 'Marry, doctor mine,' replied Bruno, 'I\r\nmarvel not thereat, for I have right well heard that Porcograsso and\r\nVannacena[401] say nought thereof.' Quoth the physician. 'Thou meanest\r\nIpocrasso and Avicenna.' 'I' faith,' answered Bruno, 'I know not; I\r\nunderstand your names as ill as you do mine; but Dolladoxy in the\r\nGrand Cham's lingo meaneth as much as to say Empress in our tongue.\r\nEgad, you would think her a plaguy fine woman! I dare well say she\r\nwould make you forget your drugs and your clysters and all your\r\nplasters.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 401: _i.e._ Fat-hog and Get-thee-to-supper, burlesque\r\nperversions of the names Ipocrasso (Hippocrates) and Avicenna.]\r\n\r\nOn this wise he bespoke him at one time and another, to enkindle him\r\nthe more, till one night, what while it chanced my lord doctor held\r\nthe light to Bruno, who was in act to paint the battle of the rats and\r\nthe cats, the former, himseeming he had now well taken him with his\r\nhospitalities, determined to open his mind to him, and accordingly,\r\nthey being alone together, he said to him, 'God knoweth, Bruno, there\r\nis no one alive for whom I would do everything as I would for thee;\r\nindeed, shouldst thou bid me go hence to Peretola, methinketh it would\r\ntake little to make me go thither; wherefore I would not have thee\r\nmarvel if I require thee of somewhat familiarly and with confidence.\r\nAs thou knowest, it is no great while since thou bespokest me of the\r\nfashions of your merry company, wherefore so great a longing hath\r\ntaken me to be one of you that never did I desire aught so much. Nor\r\nis this my desire without cause, as thou shalt see, if ever it chance\r\nthat I be of your company; for I give thee leave to make mock of me an\r\nI cause not come thither the finest serving-wench thou ever setst eyes\r\non. I saw her but last year at Cacavincigli and wish her all my\r\nweal;[402] and by the body of Christ, I had e'en given her half a\r\nscore Bolognese groats, so she would but have consented to me; but she\r\nwould not. Wherefore, as most I may, I prithee teach me what I must do\r\nto avail to be of your company and do thou also do and contrive so I\r\nmay be thereof. Indeed, you will have in me a good and loyal comrade,\r\nay, and a worshipful. Thou seest, to begin with, what a fine man I am\r\nand how well I am set up on my legs. Ay, and I have a face as it were\r\na rose, more by token that I am a doctor of medicine, such as I\r\nbelieve you have none among you. Moreover, I know many fine things and\r\ngoodly canzonets; marry, I will sing you one.' And incontinent he fell\r\na-singing.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 402: _i.e._ love her beyond anything in the world. For\r\nformer instances of this idiomatic expression, see ante, passim.]\r\n\r\nBruno had so great a mind to laugh that he was like to burst; however\r\nhe contained himself and the physician, having made an end of his\r\nsong, said, 'How deemedst thou thereof?' 'Certes,' answered Bruno,\r\n'there's no Jew's harp but would lose with you, so archigothically do\r\nyou caterwarble it.' Quoth Master Simone, 'I tell thee thou wouldst\r\nnever have believed it, hadst thou not heard me.' 'Certes,' replied\r\nBruno, 'you say sooth!' and the physician went on, 'I know store of\r\nothers; but let that be for the present. Such as thou seest me, my\r\nfather was a gentleman, albeit he abode in the country, and I myself\r\ncome by my mother of the Vallecchio family. Moreover, as thou mayst\r\nhave seen, I have the finest books and gowns of any physician in\r\nFlorence. Cock's faith, I have a gown that stood me, all reckoned, in\r\nnigh upon an hundred pounds of doits, more than half a score years\r\nago; wherefore I pray thee as most I may, to bring me to be of your\r\ncompany, and by Cock's faith, an thou do it, thou mayst be as ill as\r\nthou wilt, for I will never take a farthing of thee for my services.'\r\n\r\nBruno, hearing this and the physician seeming to him a greater\r\nnumskull than ever, said, 'Doctor, hold the light a thought more this\r\nway and take patience till I have made these rats their tails, and\r\nafter I will answer you.' The tails being finished, Bruno made believe\r\nthat the physician's request was exceeding irksome to him and said,\r\n'Doctor mine, these be great things you would do for me and I\r\nacknowledge it; nevertheless, that which you ask of me, little as it\r\nmay be for the greatness of your brain, is yet to me a very grave\r\nmatter, nor know I any one in the world for whom, it being in my\r\npower, I would do it, an I did it not for you, both because I love you\r\nas it behoveth and on account of your words, which are seasoned with\r\nso much wit that they would draw the straps out of a pair of boots,\r\nmuch more me from my purpose; for the more I consort with you, the\r\nwiser you appear to me. And I may tell you this, to boot, that, though\r\nI had none other reason, yet do I wish you well, for that I see you\r\nenamoured of so fair a creature as is she of whom you speak. But this\r\nmuch I will say to you; I have no such power in this matter as you\r\nsuppose and cannot therefore do for you that which were behoving;\r\nhowever, an you will promise me, upon your solemn and surbated[403]\r\nfaith, to keep it me secret, I will tell you the means you must use\r\nand meseemeth certain that, with such fine books and other gear as you\r\ntell me you have, you will gain your end.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 403: Syn. cauterized (_calterita_), a nonsensical word\r\nemployed by Bruno for the purpose of mystifying the credulous\r\nphysician.]\r\n\r\nQuoth the doctor, 'Say on in all assurance; I see thou art not yet\r\nwell acquainted with me and knowest not how I can keep a secret. There\r\nbe few things indeed that Messer Guasparruolo da Saliceto did, whenas\r\nhe was judge of the Provostry at Forlimpopoli, but he sent to tell me,\r\nfor that he found me so good a secret-keeper.[404] And wilt thou judge\r\nan I say sooth? I was the first man whom he told that he was to marry\r\nBergamina: seest thou now?' 'Marry, then,' rejoined Bruno, 'all is\r\nwell; if such a man trusted in you, I may well do so. The course you\r\nmust take is on this wise. You must know that we still have to this\r\nour company a captain and two counsellors, who are changed from six\r\nmonths to six months, and without fail, at the first of the month,\r\nBuffalmacco will be captain and I shall be counsellor; for so it is\r\nsettled. Now whoso is captain can do much by way of procuring\r\nwhomsoever he will to be admitted into the company; wherefore\r\nmeseemeth you should seek, inasmuch as you may, to gain Buffalmacco's\r\nfriendship and do him honour. He is a man, seeing you so wise, to fall\r\nin love with you incontinent, and whenas with your wit and with these\r\nfine things you have you shall have somedele ingratiated yourself with\r\nhim, you can make your request to him; he will not know how to say you\r\nnay. I have already bespoken him of you and he wisheth you all the\r\nweal in the world; and whenas you shall have done this, leave me do\r\nwith him.' Quoth the physician, 'That which thou counsellest liketh me\r\nwell. Indeed, an he be a man who delighteth in men of learning and\r\ntalketh but with me a little, I will engage to make him go still\r\nseeking my company, for that, as for wit, I have so much thereof that\r\nI could stock a city withal and yet abide exceeding wise.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 404: Syn. secretary, confidant (_segretaro_).]\r\n\r\nThis being settled, Bruno imparted the whole matter to Buffalmacco,\r\nwherefore it seemed to the latter a thousand years till they should\r\ncome to do that which this arch-zany went seeking. The physician, who\r\nlonged beyond measure to go a-roving, rested not till he made friends\r\nwith Buffalmacco, which he easily succeeded in doing, and therewithal\r\nhe fell to giving him, and Bruno with him, the finest suppers and\r\ndinners in the world. The two painters, like the accommodating\r\ngentlemen they were, were nothing loath to engage with him and having\r\nonce tasted the excellent wines and fat capons and other good things\r\ngalore, with which he plied them, stuck very close to him and ended by\r\nquartering themselves upon him, without awaiting overmuch invitation,\r\nstill declaring that they would not do this for another. Presently,\r\nwhenas it seemed to him time, the physician made the same request to\r\nBuffalmacco as he had made Bruno aforetime; whereupon Buffalmacco\r\nfeigned himself sore chagrined and made a great outcry against Bruno,\r\nsaying, 'I vow to the High God of Pasignano that I can scarce withhold\r\nmyself from giving thee such a clout over the head as should cause thy\r\nnose drop to thy heels, traitor that thou art; for none other than\r\nthou hath discovered these matters to the doctor.'\r\n\r\nMaster Simone did his utmost to excuse Bruno, saying and swearing that\r\nhe had learned the thing from another quarter, and after many of his\r\nwise words, he succeeded in pacifying Buffalmacco; whereupon the\r\nlatter turned to him and said, 'Doctor mine, it is very evident that\r\nyou have been at Bologna and have brought back a close mouth to these\r\nparts; and I tell you moreover that you have not learnt your A B C on\r\nthe apple as many blockheads are fain to do; nay, you have learned it\r\naright on the pumpkin, that is so long;[405] and if I mistake not,\r\nyou were baptized on a Sunday.[406] And albeit Bruno hath told me\r\nthat you told me that you studied medicine there, meseemeth you\r\nstudied rather to learn to catch men, the which you, with your wit and\r\nyour fine talk, know better to do than any man I ever set eyes on.'\r\nHere the physician took the words out of his mouth and breaking in,\r\nsaid to Bruno, 'What a thing it is to talk and consort with learned\r\nmen! Who would so have quickly apprehended every particular of my\r\nintelligence as hath this worthy man? Thou didst not half so speedily\r\nbecome aware of my value as he; but, at the least, that which I told\r\nthee, whenas thou saidst to me that Buffalmacco delighted in learned\r\nmen, seemeth it to thee I have done it?' 'Ay hast thou,' replied\r\nBruno, 'and better.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 405: A play of words upon _mela_ (apple) and _mellone_\r\n(pumpkin). _Mellone_ is strictly a water-melon; but I have rendered it\r\n\"pumpkin,\" to preserve the English idiom, \"pumpkinhead\" being our\r\nequivalent for the Italian \"melon,\" used in the sense of dullard,\r\nnoodle.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 406: According to the commentators, \"baptized on a Sunday\"\r\nanciently signified a simpleton, because salt (which is constantly\r\nused by the Italian classical writers as a synonym for wit or sense)\r\nwas not sold on Sundays.]\r\n\r\nThen said the doctor to Buffalmacco, 'Thou wouldst have told another\r\ntale, hadst thou seen me at Bologna, where there was none, great or\r\nsmall, doctor or scholar, but wished me all the weal in the world, so\r\nwell did I know to content them all with my discourse and my wit. And\r\nwhat is more, I never said a word there, but I made every one laugh,\r\nso hugely did I please them; and whenas I departed thence, they all\r\nset up the greatest lament in the world and would all have had me\r\nremain there; nay, to such a pass came it for that I should abide\r\nthere, that they would have left it to me alone to lecture on medicine\r\nto as many students as were there; but I would not, for that I was\r\ne'en minded to come hither to certain very great heritages which I\r\nhave here and which have still been in my family; and so I did.' Quoth\r\nBruno to Buffalmacco, 'How deemest thou? Thou believedst me not,\r\nwhenas I told it thee. By the Evangels, there is not a leach in these\r\nparts who is versed in asses' water to compare with this one, and\r\nassuredly thou wouldst not find another of him from here to Paris\r\ngates. Marry, hold yourself henceforth [if you can,] from doing that\r\nwhich he will.' Quoth Master Simone, 'Bruno saith sooth; but I am not\r\nunderstood here. You Florentines are somewhat dull of wit; but I would\r\nhave you see me among the doctors, as I am used to be.' 'Verily,\r\ndoctor,' said Buffalmacco, 'you are far wiser than I could ever have\r\nbelieved; wherefore to speak to you as it should be spoken to scholars\r\nsuch as you are, I tell you, cut-and-slash fashion,[407] I will\r\nwithout fail procure you to be of our company.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 407: Syn. confusedly (_frastagliatamente_).]\r\n\r\nAfter this promise the physician redoubled in his hospitalities to the\r\ntwo rogues, who enjoyed themselves [at his expense,] what while they\r\ncrammed him with the greatest extravagances in the world and fooled\r\nhim to the top of his bent, promising him to give him to mistress the\r\nCountess of Jakes,[408]who was the fairest creature to be found in\r\nall the back-settlements of the human generation. The physician\r\nenquired who this countess was, whereto quoth Buffalmacco, 'Good my\r\nseed-pumpkin, she is a very great lady and there be few houses in the\r\nworld wherein she hath not some jurisdiction. To say nothing of\r\nothers, the Minor Friars themselves render her tribute, to the sound\r\nof kettle-drums.[409] And I can assure you that, whenas she goeth\r\nabroad, she maketh herself well felt,[410] albeit she abideth for the\r\nmost part shut up. Natheless, it is no great while since she passed by\r\nyour door, one night that she repaired to the Arno, to wash her feet\r\nand take the air a little; but her most continual abiding-place is in\r\nDraughthouseland.[411] There go ofttimes about store of her serjeants,\r\nwho all in token of her supremacy, bear the staff and the plummet, and\r\nof her barons many are everywhere to be seen, such as Sirreverence of\r\nthe Gate, Goodman Turd, Hardcake,[412] Squitterbreech and others, who\r\nmethinketh are your familiars, albeit you call them not presently to\r\nmind. In the soft arms, then, of this great lady, leaving be her of\r\nCacavincigli, we will, an expectation cheat us not, bestow you.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 408: _La Contessa di Civillari_, _i.e._ the public sewers.\r\nCivillari, according to the commentators, was the name of an alley in\r\nFlorence, where all the ordure and filth of the neighbourhood was\r\ndeposited and stored in trenches for manure.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 409: _Nacchere_, syn. a loud crack of wind.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 410: Syn. smelt (_sentito_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 411: _Laterina_, _i.e._ Latrina.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 412: Lit. Broom-handle (_Manico della Scopa_).]\r\n\r\nThe physician, who had been born and bred at Bologna, understood not\r\ntheir canting terms and accordingly avouched himself well pleased with\r\nthe lady in question. Not long after this talk, the painters brought\r\nhim news that he was accepted to member of the company and the day\r\nbeing come before the night appointed for their assembly, he had them\r\nboth to dinner. When they had dined, he asked them what means it\r\nbehoved him take to come thither; whereupon quoth Buffalmacco, 'Look\r\nyou, doctor, it behoveth you have plenty of assurance; for that, an\r\nyou be not mighty resolute, you may chance to suffer hindrance and do\r\nus very great hurt; and in what it behoveth you to approve yourself\r\nvery stout-hearted you shall hear. You must find means to be this\r\nevening, at the season of the first sleep, on one of the raised tombs\r\nwhich have been lately made without Santa Maria Novella, with one of\r\nyour finest gowns on your back, so you may make an honourable figure\r\nfor your first appearance before the company and also because,\r\naccording to what was told us (we were not there after) the Countess\r\nis minded, for that you are a man of gentle birth, to make you a\r\nKnight of the Bath at her own proper costs and charges; and there you\r\nmust wait till there cometh for you he whom we shall send. And so you\r\nmay be apprised of everything, there will come for you a black horned\r\nbeast, not overbig, which will go capering about the piazza before you\r\nand making a great whistling and bounding, to terrify you; but, when\r\nhe seeth that you are not to be daunted, he will come up to you\r\nquietly. Then do you, without any fear, come down from the tomb and\r\nmount the beast, naming neither God nor the Saints; and as soon as you\r\nare settled on his back, you must cross your hands upon your breast,\r\nin the attitude of obeisance, and touch him no more. He will then set\r\noff softly and bring you to us; but if you call upon God or the\r\nSaints or show fear, I must tell you that he may chance to cast you\r\noff or strike you into some place where you are like to stink for it;\r\nwherefore, an your heart misgive you and unless you can make sure of\r\nbeing mighty resolute, come not thither, for you would but do us a\r\nmischief, without doing yourself any good.'[413]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 413: Lit. \"do _yourself_ a mischief, without doing _us_ any\r\ngood\"; but the sequel shows that the contrary is meant, as in the\r\ntext.]\r\n\r\nQuoth the physician, 'I see you know me not yet; maybe you judge of me\r\nby my gloves and long gown. If you knew what I did aforetimes at\r\nBologna anights, when I went a-wenching whiles with my comrades, you\r\nwould marvel. Cock's faith, there was such and such a night when, one\r\nof them refusing to come with us, (more by token that she was a scurvy\r\nlittle baggage, no higher than my fist,) I dealt her, to begin with,\r\ngood store of cuffs, then, taking her up bodily, I dare say I carried\r\nher a crossbowshot and wrought so that needs must she come with us.\r\nAnother time I remember me that, without any other in my company than\r\na serving-man of mine, I passed yonder alongside the Cemetery of the\r\nMinor Friars, a little after the Ave Maria, albeit there had been a\r\nwoman buried there that very day, and felt no whit of fear; wherefore\r\nmisdoubt you not of this, for I am but too stout of heart and lusty.\r\nMoreover, I tell you that, to do you credit at my coming thither, I\r\nwill don my gown of scarlet, wherein I was admitted doctor, and we\r\nshall see if the company rejoice not at my sight and an I be not made\r\ncaptain out of hand. You shall e'en see how the thing will go, once I\r\nam there, since, without having yet set eyes on me, this countess hath\r\nfallen so enamoured of me that she is minded to make me a Knight of\r\nthe Bath. It may be knighthood will not sit so ill on me nor shall I\r\nbe at a loss to carry it off with worship! Marry, only leave me do.'\r\n'You say very well,' answered Buffalmacco; 'but look you leave us not\r\nin the lurch and not come or not be found at the trysting-place,\r\nwhenas we shall send for you; and this I say for that the weather is\r\ncold and you gentlemen doctors are very careful of yourselves\r\nthereanent.' 'God forbid!' cried Master Simone. 'I am none of your\r\nchilly ones. I reck not of the cold; seldom or never, whenas I rise of\r\na night for my bodily occasions, as a man will bytimes, do I put me on\r\nmore than my fur gown over my doublet. Wherefore I will certainly be\r\nthere.'\r\n\r\nThereupon they took leave of him and whenas it began to grow towards\r\nnight, Master Simone contrived to make some excuse or other to his\r\nwife and secretly got out his fine gown; then, whenas it seemed to him\r\ntime, he donned it and betook himself to Santa Maria Novella, where he\r\nmounted one of the aforesaid tombs and huddling himself up on the\r\nmarble, for that the cold was great, he proceeded to wait the coming\r\nof the beast. Meanwhile Buffalmacco, who was tall and robust of his\r\nperson, made shift to have one of those masks that were wont to be\r\nused for certain games which are not held nowadays, and donning a\r\nblack fur pelisse, inside out, arrayed himself therein on such wise\r\nthat he seemed a very bear, save that his mask had a devil's face and\r\nwas horned. Thus accoutred, he betook himself to the new Piazza of\r\nSanta Maria, Bruno following him to see how the thing should go. As\r\nsoon as he perceived that the physician was there, he fell a-capering\r\nand caracoling and made a terrible great blustering about the piazza,\r\nwhistling and howling and bellowing as he were possessed of the devil.\r\nWhen Master Simone, who was more fearful than a woman, heard and saw\r\nthis, every hair of his body stood on end and he fell a-trembling all\r\nover, and it was now he had liefer been at home than there.\r\nNevertheless, since he was e'en there, he enforced himself to take\r\nheart, so overcome was he with desire to see the marvels whereof the\r\npainters had told him.\r\n\r\nAfter Buffalmacco had raged about awhile, as hath been said, he made a\r\nshow of growing pacified and coming up to the tomb whereon was the\r\nphysician, stood stock-still. Master Simone, who was all a-tremble for\r\nfear, knew not what to do, whether to mount or abide where he was.\r\nHowever, at last, fearing that the beast should do him a mischief, an\r\nhe mounted him not, he did away the first fear with the second and\r\ncoming down from the tomb, mounted on his back, saying softly, 'God\r\naid me!' Then he settled himself as best he might and still trembling\r\nin every limb, crossed his hands upon his breast, as it had been\r\nenjoined him; whereupon Buffalmacco set off at an amble towards Santa\r\nMaria della Scala and going on all fours, brought him hard by the\r\nNunnery of Ripole. In those days there were dykes in that quarter,\r\nwherein the tillers of the neighbouring lands let empty the jakes, to\r\nmanure their fields withal; whereto whenas Buffalmacco came nigh, he\r\nwent up to the brink of one of them and taking the opportunity, laid\r\nhold of one of the physician's legs and jerking him off his back,\r\npitched him clean in, head foremost. Then he fell a-snorting and\r\nsnarling and capering and raged about awhile; after which he made off\r\nalongside Santa Maria della Scala till he came to Allhallows Fields.\r\nThere he found Bruno, who had taken to flight, for that he was unable\r\nto restrain his laughter; and with him, after they had made merry\r\ntogether at Master Simone's expense, he addressed himself to see from\r\nafar what the bemoiled physician should do.\r\n\r\nMy lord leech, finding himself in that abominable place, struggled to\r\narise and strove as best he might to win forth thereof; and after\r\nfalling in again and again, now here and now there, and swallowing\r\nsome drachms of the filth, he at last succeeded in making his way out\r\nof the dyke, in the woefullest of plights, bewrayed from head to foot\r\nand leaving his bonnet behind him. Then, having wiped himself as best\r\nhe might with his hands and knowing not what other course to take, he\r\nreturned home and knocked till it was opened to him. Hardly was he\r\nentered, stinking as he did, and the door shut again ere up came Bruno\r\nand Buffalmacco, to hear how he should be received of his wife, and\r\nstanding hearkening, they heard the lady give him the foulest rating\r\nwas ever given poor devil, saying, 'Good lack, what a pickle thou art\r\nin! Thou hast been gallanting it to some other woman and must needs\r\nseek to cut a figure with thy gown of scarlet! What, was not I enough\r\nfor thee? Why, man alive, I could suffice to a whole people, let alone\r\nthee. Would God they had choked thee, like as they cast thee whereas\r\nthou deservedst to be thrown! Here's a fine physician for you, to have\r\na wife of his own and go a-gadding anights after other folk's\r\nwomankind!' And with these and many other words of the same fashion\r\nshe gave not over tormenting him till midnight, what while the\r\nphysician let wash himself from head to foot.\r\n\r\nNext morning up came Bruno and Buffalmacco, who had painted all their\r\nflesh under their clothes with livid blotches, such as beatings use to\r\nmake, and entering the physician's house, found him already arisen.\r\nAccordingly they went in to him and found the whole place full of\r\nstench, for that they had not yet been able so to clean everything\r\nthat it should not stink there. Master Simone, seeing them enter, came\r\nto meet them and bade God give them good day; whereto the two rogues,\r\nas they had agreed beforehand, replied with an angry air, saying,\r\n'That say we not to you; nay, rather, we pray God give you so many ill\r\nyears that you may die a dog's death, as the most disloyal man and the\r\nvilest traitor alive; for it was no thanks to you that, whereas we\r\nstudied to do you pleasure and worship, we were not slain like dogs.\r\nAs it is, thanks to your disloyalty, we have gotten so many buffets\r\nthis past night that an ass would go to Rome for less, without\r\nreckoning that we have gone in danger of being expelled the company\r\ninto which we had taken order for having you received. An you believe\r\nus not, look at our bodies and see how they have fared.' Then, opening\r\ntheir clothes in front, they showed him, by an uncertain light, their\r\nbreasts all painted and covered them up again in haste.\r\n\r\nThe physician would have excused himself and told of his mishaps and\r\nhow and where he had been cast; but Buffalmacco said, 'Would he had\r\nthrown you off the bridge into the Arno! Why did you call on God and\r\nthe Saints? Were you not forewarned of this?' 'By God His faith,'\r\nreplied the physician, 'I did it not.' 'How?' cried Buffalmacco. 'You\r\ndid not call on them? Egad, you did it again and again; for our\r\nmessenger told us that you shook like a reed and knew not where you\r\nwere. Marry, for the nonce you have befooled us finely; but never\r\nagain shall any one serve us thus, and we will yet do you such honour\r\nthereof as you merit.' The physician fell to craving pardon and\r\nconjuring them for God's sake not to dishonour him and studied to\r\nappease them with the best words he could command. And if aforetime he\r\nhad entreated them with honour, from that time forth he honoured them\r\nyet more and made much of them, entertaining them with banquets and\r\notherwhat, for fear lest they should publish his shame. Thus, then, as\r\nyou have heard, is sense taught to whoso hath learned no great store\r\nthereof at Bologna.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TENTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Eighth]\r\n\r\n     A CERTAIN WOMAN OF SICILY ARTFULLY DESPOILETH A MERCHANT OF\r\n     THAT WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT TO PALERMO; BUT HE, MAKING BELIEVE\r\n     TO HAVE RETURNED THITHER WITH MUCH GREATER PLENTY OF\r\n     MERCHANDISE THAN BEFORE, BORROWETH MONEY OF HER AND LEAVETH\r\n     HER WATER AND TOW IN PAYMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nHow much the queen's story in divers places made the ladies laugh, it\r\nneeded not to ask; suffice it to say that there was none of them to\r\nwhose eyes the tears had not come a dozen times for excess of\r\nlaughter: but, after it had an end, Dioneo, knowing that it was come\r\nto his turn to tell, said, \"Gracious ladies, it is a manifest thing\r\nthat sleights and devices are the more pleasing, the subtler the\r\ntrickster who is thereby artfully outwitted. Wherefore, albeit you\r\nhave related very fine stories, I mean to tell you one, which should\r\nplease you more than any other that hath been told upon the same\r\nsubject, inasmuch as she who was cheated was a greater mistress of the\r\nart of cheating others than was any of the men or women who were\r\ncozened by those of whom you have told.\r\n\r\nThere used to be, and belike is yet, a custom, in all maritime places\r\nwhich have a port, that all merchants who come thither with\r\nmerchandise, having unloaded it, should carry it all into a warehouse,\r\nwhich is in many places called a customhouse, kept by the commonality\r\nor by the lord of the place. There they give unto those who are\r\ndeputed to that end a note in writing of all their merchandise and the\r\nvalue thereof, and they thereupon make over to each merchant a\r\nstorehouse, wherein he layeth up his goods under lock and key.\r\nMoreover, the said officers enter in the book of the Customs, to each\r\nmerchant's credit, all his merchandise, causing themselves after he\r\npaid their dues of the merchants, whether for all his said merchandise\r\nor for such part thereof as he withdraweth from the customhouse. By\r\nthis book of the Customs the brokers mostly inform themselves of the\r\nquality and the quantity of the goods that are in bond there and also\r\nwho are the merchants that own them; and with these latter, as\r\noccasion serveth them, they treat of exchanges and barters and sales\r\nand other transactions. This usance, amongst many other places, was\r\ncurrent at Palermo in Sicily, where likewise there were and are yet\r\nmany women, very fair of their person, but sworn enemies to honesty,\r\nwho would be and are by those who know them not held great ladies and\r\npassing virtuous and who, being given not to shave, but altogether to\r\nflay men, no sooner espy a merchant there than they inform themselves\r\nby the book of the Customs of that which he hath there and how much he\r\ncan do;[414] after which by their lovesome and engaging fashions and\r\nwith the most dulcet words, they study to allure the said merchants\r\nand draw them into the snare of their love; and many an one have they\r\naforetime lured thereinto, from whom they have wiled great part of\r\ntheir merchandise; nay, many have they despoiled of all, and of these\r\nthere be some who have left goods and ship and flesh and bones in\r\ntheir hands, so sweetly hath the barberess known to ply the razor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 414: _i.e._ what he is worth.]\r\n\r\nIt chanced, not long since, that there came thither, sent by his\r\nmasters, one of our young Florentines, by name Niccolo da Cignano,\r\nthough more commonly called Salabaetto, with as many woollen cloths,\r\nleft on his hands from the Salerno fair, as might be worth some five\r\nhundred gold florins, which having given the customhouse officers the\r\ninvoice thereof, he laid up in a magazine and began, without showing\r\novermuch haste to dispose of them, to go bytimes a-pleasuring about\r\nthe city. He being of a fair complexion and yellow-haired and withal\r\nvery sprightly and personable, it chanced that one of these same\r\nbarberesses, who styled herself Madam Biancofiore, having heard\r\nsomewhat of his affairs, cast her eyes on him; which he perceiving and\r\ntaking her for some great lady, concluded that he pleased her for his\r\ngood looks and bethought himself to order this amour with the utmost\r\nsecrecy; wherefore, without saying aught thereof to any, he fell to\r\npassing and repassing before her house. She, noting this, after she\r\nhad for some days well enkindled him with her eyes, making believe to\r\nlanguish for him, privily despatched to him one of her women, who was\r\na past mistress in the procuring art and who, after much parley, told\r\nhim, well nigh with tears in her eyes, that he had so taken her\r\nmistress with his comeliness and his pleasing fashions that she could\r\nfind no rest day or night; wherefore, whenas it pleased him, she\r\ndesired, more than aught else, to avail to foregather with him privily\r\nin a bagnio; then, pulling a ring from her pouch, she gave it to him\r\non the part of her mistress. Salabaetto, hearing this, was the\r\njoyfullest man that was aye and taking the ring, rubbed it against his\r\neyes and kissed it; after which he set it on his finger and replied to\r\nthe good woman that, if Madam Biancofiore loved him, she was well\r\nrequited it, for that he loved her more than his proper life and was\r\nready to go whereassoever it should please her and at any hour. The\r\nmessenger returned to her mistress with this answer and it was\r\nappointed Salabaetto out of hand at what bagnio he should expect her\r\non the ensuing day after vespers.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, without saying aught of the matter to any, he punctually\r\nrepaired thither at the hour appointed him and found the bagnio taken\r\nby the lady; nor had he waited long ere there came two slave-girls\r\nladen with gear and bearing on their heads, the one a fine large\r\nmattress of cotton wool and the other a great basket full of gear. The\r\nmattress they set on a bedstead in one of the chambers of the bagnio\r\nand spread thereon a pair of very fine sheets, laced with silk,\r\ntogether with a counterpane of snow-white Cyprus buckram[415] and two\r\npillows wonder-curiously wrought.[416] Then, putting off their clothes\r\nthey entered the bath and swept it all and washed it excellent well.\r\nNor was it long ere the lady herself came thither, with other two\r\nslave-girls, and accosted Salabaetto with the utmost joy; then, as\r\nfirst she had commodity, after she had both clipped and kissed him\r\namain, heaving the heaviest sighs in the world, she said to him, 'I\r\nknow not who could have brought me to this pass, other than thou; thou\r\nhast kindled a fire in my vitals, little dog of a Tuscan!' Then, at\r\nher instance, they entered the bath, both naked, and with them two of\r\nthe slave-girls; and there, without letting any else lay a finger on\r\nhim, she with her own hands washed Salabaetto all wonder-well with\r\nmusk and clove-scented soap; after which she let herself be washed and\r\nrubbed of the slave-girls. This done, the latter brought two very\r\nwhite and fine sheets, whence came so great a scent of roses that\r\neverything there seemed roses, in one of which they wrapped Salabaetto\r\nand in the other the lady and taking them in their arms, carried them\r\nboth to the bed prepared for them. There, whenas they had left\r\nsweating, the slave-girls did them loose from the sheets wherein they\r\nwere wrapped and they abode naked in the others, whilst the girls\r\nbrought out of the basket wonder-goodly casting-bottles of silver,\r\nfull of sweet waters, rose and jessamine and orange and citron-flower\r\nscented, and sprinkled them all therewith; after which boxes of\r\nsuccades and wines of great price were produced and they refreshed\r\nthemselves awhile.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 415: _Bucherame._ The word \"buckram\" was anciently applied\r\nto the finest linen cloth, as is apparently the case here; see\r\nDucange, voce _Boquerannus_, and Florio, voce _Bucherame_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 416: _i.e._ in needlework.]\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Salabaetto as he were in Paradise and he cast a thousand\r\nglances at the lady, who was certes very handsome, himseeming each\r\nhour was an hundred years till the slave-girls should begone and he\r\nshould find himself in her arms. Presently, at her commandment, the\r\ngirls departed the chamber, leaving a flambeau alight there; whereupon\r\nshe embraced Salabaetto and he her, and they abode together a great\r\nwhile, to the exceeding pleasure of the Florentine, to whom it seemed\r\nshe was all afire for love of him. Whenas it seemed to her time to\r\nrise, she called the slave-girls and they clad themselves; then they\r\nrecruited themselves somedele with a second collation of wine and\r\nsweetmeats and washed their hands and faces with odoriferous waters;\r\nafter which, being about to depart, the lady said to Salabaetto, 'So\r\nit be agreeable to thee, it were doing me a very great favour an thou\r\ncamest this evening to sup and lie the night with me.' Salabaetto, who\r\nwas by this time altogether captivated by her beauty and the artful\r\npleasantness of her fashions and firmly believed himself to be loved\r\nof her as he were the heart out of her body, replied, 'Madam, your\r\nevery pleasure is supremely agreeable to me, wherefore both to-night\r\nand at all times I mean to do that which shall please you and that\r\nwhich shall be commanded me of you.'\r\n\r\nAccordingly the lady returned to her house, where she caused well\r\nbedeck her bedchamber with her dresses and gear and letting make ready\r\na splendid supper, awaited Salabaetto, who, as soon as it was grown\r\nsomewhat dark, betook himself thither and being received with open\r\narms, supped with all cheer and commodity of service. Thereafter they\r\nbetook themselves into the bedchamber, where he smelt a marvellous\r\nfragrance of aloes-wood and saw the bed very richly adorned with\r\nCyprian singing-birds[417] and store of fine dresses upon the pegs,\r\nall which things together and each of itself made him conclude that\r\nthis must be some great and rich lady. And although he had heard some\r\nwhispers to the contrary anent her manner of life, he would not\r\nanywise believe it; or, if he e'en gave so much credit thereto as to\r\nallow that she might erst have cozened others, for nothing in the\r\nworld could he have believed that this might possibly happen to\r\nhimself. He lay that night with her in the utmost delight, still\r\nwaxing more enamoured, and in the morning she girt him on a quaint and\r\ngoodly girdle of silver, with a fine purse thereto, saying, 'Sweet my\r\nSalabaetto, I commend myself to thy remembrance, and like as my person\r\nis at thy pleasure, even so is all that is here and all that dependeth\r\nupon me at thy service and commandment.' Salabaetto, rejoiced,\r\nembraced and kissed her; then, going forth of her house, he betook\r\nhimself whereas the other merchants were used to resort.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 417: \"It was the custom in those days to attach to the\r\nbedposts sundry small instruments in the form of birds, which, by\r\nmeans of certain mechanical devices, gave forth sounds modulated like\r\nthe song of actual birds.\"--_Fanfani._]\r\n\r\nOn this wise consorting with her at one time and another, without its\r\ncosting him aught in the world, and growing every hour more entangled,\r\nit befell that he sold his stuffs for ready money and made a good\r\nprofit thereby; of which the lady incontinent heard, not from him, but\r\nfrom others, and Salabaetto being come one night to visit her, she\r\nfell to prattling and wantoning with him, kissing and clipping him and\r\nfeigning herself so enamoured of him that it seemed she must die of\r\nlove in his arms. Moreover, she would fain have given him two very\r\nfine hanaps of silver that she had; but he would not take them, for\r\nthat he had had of her, at one time and another, what was worth a good\r\nthirty gold florins, without availing to have her take of him so much\r\nas a groat's worth. At last, whenas she had well enkindled him by\r\nshowing herself so enamoured and freehanded, one of her slave-girls\r\ncalled her, as she had ordained beforehand; whereupon she left the\r\nchamber and coming back, after awhile, in tears cast herself face\r\ndownward on the bed and fell to making the woefullest lamentation ever\r\nwoman made. Salabaetto, marvelling at this, caught her in his arms and\r\nfell a-weeping with her and saying, 'Alack, heart of my body, what\r\naileth thee thus suddenly? What is the cause of this grief? For God's\r\nsake, tell it me, my soul.' The lady, after letting herself be long\r\nentreated, answered, 'Woe's me, sweet my lord, I know not what to say\r\nor to do; I have but now received letters from Messina and my brother\r\nwriteth me that, should I sell or pawn all that is here,[418] I must\r\nwithout fail send him a thousand gold florins within eight days from\r\nthis time, else will his head be cut off; and I know not how I shall\r\ndo to get this sum so suddenly. Had I but fifteen days' grace, I would\r\nfind a means of procuring it from a certain quarter whence I am to\r\nhave much more, or I would sell one of our farms; but, as this may not\r\nbe, I had liefer be dead than that this ill news should have come to\r\nme.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 418: Syn. that which belongeth to us (_ciò che ci è_,) _ci_,\r\nas I have before noted, signifying both \"here\" and \"us,\" dative and\r\naccusative.]\r\n\r\nSo saying, she made a show of being sore afflicted and stinted not\r\nfrom weeping; whereupon quoth Salabaetto, whom the flames of love had\r\nbereft of great part of his wonted good sense, so that he believed\r\nher tears to be true and her words truer yet, 'Madam, I cannot oblige\r\nyou with a thousand florins, but five hundred I can very well advance\r\nyou, since you believe you will be able to return them to me within a\r\nfortnight from this time; and this is of your good fortune that I\r\nchanced but yesterday to sell my stuffs; for, had it not been so, I\r\ncould not have lent you a groat.' 'Alack,' cried the lady, 'hast thou\r\nthen been straitened for lack of money? Marry, why didst thou not\r\nrequire me thereof? Though I have not a thousand, I had an hundred and\r\neven two hundred to give thee. Thou hast deprived me of all heart to\r\naccept of thee the service thou profferest me.' Salabaetto was more\r\nthan ever taken with these words and said, 'Madam, I would not have\r\nyou refrain on that account, for, had I had such an occasion therefor\r\nas you presently have, I would assuredly have asked you.' 'Alack,\r\nSalabaetto mine,' replied the lady, 'now know I aright that thine is a\r\ntrue and perfect love for me, since, without waiting to be required,\r\nthou freely succoureth me, in such a strait, with so great a sum of\r\nmoney. Certes, I was all thine without this, but with this I shall be\r\nfar more so; nor shall I ever forget that I owe thee my brother's\r\nlife. But God knoweth I take it sore unwillingly, seeing that thou art\r\na merchant and that with money merchants transact all their affairs;\r\nhowever, since need constraineth me, and I have certain assurance of\r\nspeedily restoring it to thee, I will e'en take it; and for the rest,\r\nan I find no readier means, I will pawn all these my possessions.' So\r\nsaying, she let herself fall, weeping, on Salabaetto's neck. He fell\r\nto comforting her and after abiding the night with her, he, next\r\nmorning, to approve himself her most liberal servant, without waiting\r\nto be asked by her, carried her five hundred right gold florins, which\r\nshe received with tears in her eyes, but laughter in her heart,\r\nSalabaetto contenting himself with her simple promise.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the lady had the money, the signs began to change, and\r\nwhereas before he had free access to her whenassoever it pleased him,\r\nreasons now began to crop up, whereby it betided him not to win\r\nadmission there once out of seven times, nor was he received with the\r\nsame countenance nor the same caresses and rejoicings as before. And\r\nthe term at which he was to have had his monies again being, not to\r\nsay come, but past by a month or two and he requiring them, words were\r\ngiven him in payment. Thereupon his eyes were opened to the wicked\r\nwoman's arts and his own lack of wit, wherefore, feeling that he could\r\nsay nought of her beyond that which might please her concerning the\r\nmatter, since he had neither script nor other evidence thereof, and\r\nbeing ashamed to complain to any, as well for that he had been\r\nforewarned thereof as for fear of the scoffs which he might reasonably\r\nexpect for his folly, he was beyond measure woeful and inwardly\r\nbewailed his credulity.\r\n\r\nAt last, having had divers letters from his masters, requiring him to\r\nchange[419] the monies in question and remit them to them, he\r\ndetermined to depart, lest, an he did it not, his default should be\r\ndiscovered there, and accordingly, going aboard a little ship, he\r\nbetook himself, not to Pisa, as he should have done, but to Naples.\r\nThere at that time was our gossip Pietro dello Canigiano, treasurer to\r\nthe Empress of Constantinople, a man of great understanding and subtle\r\nwit and a fast friend of Salabaetto and his family; and to him, as to\r\na very discreet man, the disconsolate Florentine recounted that which\r\nhe had done and the mischance that had befallen him, requiring him of\r\naid and counsel, so he might contrive to gain his living there, and\r\navouching his intention nevermore to return to Florence. Canigiano was\r\nconcerned for this and said, 'Ill hast thou done and ill hast thou\r\ncarried thyself; thou hast disobeyed thy masters and hast, at one\r\ncast, spent a great sum of money in wantonness; but, since it is done,\r\nwe must look for otherwhat.'[420] Accordingly, like a shrewd man as he\r\nwas, he speedily bethought himself what was to be done and told it to\r\nSalabaetto, who was pleased with the device and set about putting it\r\nin execution. He had some money and Canigiano having lent him other\r\nsome, he made up a number of bales well packed and corded; then,\r\nbuying a score of oil-casks and filling them, he embarked the whole\r\nand returned to Palermo, where, having given the customhouse officers\r\nthe bill of lading and the value of the casks and let enter everything\r\nto his account, he laid the whole up in the magazines, saying that he\r\nmeant not to touch them till such time as certain other merchandise\r\nwhich he expected should be come.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 419: _i.e._ procure bills of exchange for.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 420: _i.e._ we must see what is to be done.]\r\n\r\nBiancofiore, getting wind of this and hearing that the merchandise he\r\nhad presently brought with him was worth good two thousand florins,\r\nwithout reckoning what he looked for, which was valued at more than\r\nthree thousand, bethought herself that she had flown at too small game\r\nand determined to restore him the five hundred florins, so she might\r\navail to have the greater part of the five thousand. Accordingly, she\r\nsent for him and Salabaetto, grown cunning, went to her; whereupon,\r\nmaking believe to know nothing of that which he had brought with him,\r\nshe received him with a great show of fondness and said to him,\r\n'Harkye, if thou wast vexed with me, for that I repaid thee not thy\r\nmonies on the very day....' Salabaetto fell a-laughing and answered;\r\n'In truth, madam, it did somewhat displease me, seeing I would have\r\ntorn out my very heart to give it you, an I thought to pleasure you\r\nwithal; but I will have you hear how I am vexed with you. Such and so\r\ngreat is the love I bear you, that I have sold the most part of my\r\npossessions and have presently brought hither merchandise to the value\r\nof more than two thousand florins and expect from the westward as much\r\nmore as will be worth over three thousand, with which I mean to stock\r\nme a warehouse in this city and take up my sojourn here, so I may\r\nstill be near you, meseeming I fare better of your love than ever\r\nlover of his lady.'\r\n\r\n'Look you, Salabaetto,' answered the lady, 'every commodity of thine\r\nis mighty pleasing to me, as that of him whom I love more than my\r\nlife, and it pleaseth me amain that thou art returned hither with\r\nintent to sojourn here, for that I hope yet to have good time galore\r\nwith thee; but I would fain excuse myself somedele to thee for that,\r\nwhenas thou wast about to depart, thou wouldst bytimes have come\r\nhither and couldst not, and whiles thou camest and wast not so gladly\r\nseen as thou wast used to be, more by token that I returned thee not\r\nthy monies at the time promised. Thou must know that I was then in\r\nvery great concern and sore affliction, and whoso is in such case, how\r\nmuch soever he may love another, cannot always show him so cheerful a\r\ncountenance or pay him such attention as he might wish. Moreover, thou\r\nmust know that it is mighty uneasy for a woman to avail to find a\r\nthousand gold florins; all day long we are put off with lies and that\r\nwhich is promised us is not performed unto us; wherefore needs must we\r\nin our turn lie unto others. Hence cometh it, and not of my default,\r\nthat I gave thee not back thy monies. However, I had them a little\r\nafter thy departure, and had I known whither to send them, thou mayst\r\nbe assured that I would have remitted them to thee; but, not knowing\r\nthis, I kept them for thee.' Then, letting fetch a purse wherein were\r\nthe very monies he had brought her, she put it into his hand, saying,\r\n'Count them if there be five hundred.' Never was Salabaetto so glad;\r\nhe counted them and finding them five hundred, put them up and said,\r\n'Madam, I am assured that you say sooth; but you have done enough [to\r\nconvince me of your love for me,] and I tell you that, for this and\r\nfor the love I bear you, you could never require me, for any your\r\noccasion, of whatsoever sum I might command, but I would oblige you\r\ntherewith; and whenas I am established here, you may put this to the\r\nproof.'\r\n\r\nHaving again on this wise renewed his loves with her in words, he fell\r\nagain to using amically with her, whilst she made much of him and\r\nshowed him the greatest goodwill and honour in the world, feigning the\r\nutmost love for him. But he, having a mind to return her cheat for\r\ncheat, being one day sent for by her to sup and sleep with her, went\r\nthither so chapfallen and so woebegone that it seemed as he would die.\r\nBiancofiore, embracing him and kissing him, began to question him of\r\nwhat ailed him to be thus melancholy, and he, after letting himself be\r\nimportuned a good while, answered, 'I am a ruined man, for that the\r\nship, wherein is the merchandise I expected, hath been taken by the\r\ncorsairs of Monaco and held to ransom in ten thousand gold florins,\r\nwhereof it falleth to me to pay a thousand, and I have not a farthing,\r\nfor that the five hundred pieces thou returnedst to me I sent\r\nincontinent to Naples to lay out in cloths to be brought hither; and\r\nshould I go about at this present to sell the merchandise I have here,\r\nI should scarce get a penny for two pennyworth, for that it is no time\r\nfor selling. Nor am I yet so well known that I could find any here to\r\nhelp me to this, wherefore I know not what to do or to say; for, if I\r\nsend not the monies speedily, the merchandise will be carried off to\r\nMonaco and I shall never again have aught thereof.'\r\n\r\nThe lady was mightily concerned at this, fearing to lose him\r\naltogether, and considering how she should do, so he might not go to\r\nMonaco, said, 'God knoweth I am sore concerned for the love of thee;\r\nbut what availeth it to afflict oneself thus? If I had the monies, God\r\nknoweth I would lend them to thee incontinent; but I have them not.\r\nTrue, there is a certain person here who obliged me the other day\r\nwith the five hundred florins that I lacked; but he will have heavy\r\nusance for his monies; nay, he requireth no less than thirty in the\r\nhundred, and if thou wilt borrow of him, needs must he be made secure\r\nwith a good pledge. For my part, I am ready to engage for thee all\r\nthese my goods and my person, to boot, for as much as he will lend\r\nthereon; but how wilt thou assure him of the rest?' Salabaetto readily\r\napprehended the reason that moved her to do him this service and\r\ndivined that it was she herself who was to lend him the money;\r\nwherewith he was well pleased and thanking her, answered that he would\r\nnot be put off for exorbitant usance, need constraining him. Moreover,\r\nhe said that he would give assurance of the merchandise he had in the\r\ncustomhouse, letting inscribe it to him who should lend him the money;\r\nbut that needs must be kept the key of the magazines, as well that he\r\nmight be able to show his wares, an it were required of him, as that\r\nnothing might be touched or changed or tampered withal.\r\n\r\nThe lady answered that it was well said and that this was good enough\r\nassurance; wherefore, as soon as the day was come, she sent for a\r\nbroker, in whom she trusted greatly, and taking order with him of the\r\nmatter, gave him a thousand gold florins, which he lent to Salabaetto,\r\nletting inscribe in his own name at the customhouse that which the\r\nlatter had there; then, having made their writings and counter-writings\r\ntogether and being come to an accord,[421] they occupied themselves\r\nwith their other affairs. Salabaetto, as soonest he might, embarked,\r\nwith the fifteen hundred gold florins, on board a little ship and\r\nreturned to Pietro dello Canigiano at Naples, whence he remitted to\r\nhis masters, who had despatched him with the stuffs, a good and entire\r\naccount thereof. Then, having repaid Pietro and every other to whom he\r\nowed aught, he made merry several days with Canigiano over the cheat\r\nhe had put upon the Sicilian trickstress; after which, resolved to be\r\nno more a merchant, he betook himself to Ferrara.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 421: _i.e._ having executed and exchanged the necessary\r\nlegal documents for the proper carrying out of the transaction and\r\ncompleted the matter to their mutual satisfaction.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Biancofiore, finding that Salabaetto had left Palermo,\r\nbegan to marvel and wax misdoubtful and after having awaited him good\r\ntwo months, seeing that he came not, she caused the broker force open\r\nthe magazines. Trying first the casks, which she believed to be filled\r\nwith oil, she found them full of seawater, save that there was in each\r\nmaybe a runlet of oil at the top near the bunghole. Then, undoing the\r\nbales, she found them all full of tow, with the exception of two,\r\nwhich were stuffs; and in brief, with all that was there, there was\r\nnot more than two hundred florins' worth. Wherefore Biancofiore,\r\nconfessing herself outwitted, long lamented the five hundred florins\r\nrepaid and yet more the thousand lent, saying often, 'Who with a\r\nTuscan hath to do, Must nor be blind nor see askew.' On this wise,\r\nhaving gotten nothing for her pains but loss and scorn, she found, to\r\nher cost, that some folk know as much as others.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Dioneo made an end of his story than Lauretta, knowing\r\nthe term to be come beyond which she was not to reign and having\r\ncommended Canigiano's counsel (which was approved good by its effect)\r\nand Salabaetto's shrewdness (which was no less commendable) in\r\ncarrying it into execution, lifted the laurel from her own head and\r\nset it on that of Emilia, saying, with womanly grace, \"Madam, I know\r\nnot how pleasant a queen we shall have of you; but, at the least, we\r\nshall have a fair one. Look, then, that your actions be conformable to\r\nyour beauties.\" So saying, she returned to her seat, whilst Emilia, a\r\nthought abashed, not so much at being made queen as to see herself\r\npublicly commended of that which women use most to covet, waxed such\r\nin face as are the new-blown roses in the dawning. However, after she\r\nhad kept her eyes awhile lowered, till the redness had given place,\r\nshe took order with the seneschal of that which concerned the general\r\nentertainment and presently said, \"Delightsome ladies, it is common,\r\nafter oxen have toiled some part of the day, confined under the yoke,\r\nto see them loosed and eased thereof and freely suffered to go\r\na-pasturing, where most it liketh them, about the woods; and it is\r\nmanifest also that leafy gardens, embowered with various plants, are\r\nnot less, but much more fair than groves wherein one seeth only oaks.\r\nWherefore, seeing how many days we have discoursed, under the\r\nrestraint of a fixed law, I opine that, as well unto us as to those\r\nwhom need constraineth to labour for their daily bread, it is not only\r\nuseful, but necessary, to play the truant awhile and wandering thus\r\nafield, to regain strength to enter anew under the yoke. Wherefore,\r\nfor that which is to be related to-morrow, ensuing your delectable\r\nusance of discourse, I purpose not to restrict you to any special\r\nsubject, but will have each discourse according as it pleaseth him,\r\nholding it for certain that the variety of the things which will be\r\nsaid will afford us no less entertainment than to have discoursed of\r\none alone; and having done thus, whoso shall come after me in the\r\nsovranty may, as stronger than I, avail with greater assurance to\r\nrestrict us within the limits of the wonted laws.\" So saying, she set\r\nevery one at liberty till supper-time.\r\n\r\nAll commended the queen of that which she had said, holding it sagely\r\nspoken, and rising to their feet, addressed themselves, this to one\r\nkind of diversion and that to another, the ladies to weaving garlands\r\nand to gambolling and the young men to gaming and singing. On this\r\nwise they passed the time until the supper-hour, which being come,\r\nthey supped with mirth and good cheer about the fair fountain and\r\nafter diverted themselves with singing and dancing according to the\r\nwonted usance. At last, the queen, to ensue the fashion of her\r\npredecessors, commanded Pamfilo to sing a song, notwithstanding those\r\nwhich sundry of the company had already sung of their freewill; and he\r\nreadily began thus:\r\n\r\n         Such is thy pleasure, Love\r\n     And such the allegresse I feel thereby\r\n     That happy, burning in thy fire, am I.\r\n\r\n     The abounding gladness in my heart that glows,\r\n       For the high joy and dear\r\n         Whereto thou hast me led,\r\n     Unable to contain there, overflows\r\n       And in my face's cheer\r\n         Displays my happihead;\r\n         For being enamouréd\r\n     In such a worship-worthy place and high\r\n     Makes eath to me the burning I aby.\r\n\r\n     I cannot with my finger what I feel\r\n       Limn, Love, nor do I know\r\n         My bliss in song to vent;\r\n     Nay, though I knew it, needs must I conceal,\r\n       For, once divulged, I trow\r\n         'Twould turn to dreariment.\r\n         Yet am I so content,\r\n     All speech were halt and feeble, did I try\r\n     The least thereof with words to signify.\r\n\r\n     Who might conceive it that these arms of mine\r\n       Should anywise attain\r\n         Whereas I've held them aye,\r\n     Or that my face should reach so fair a shrine\r\n       As that, of favour fain\r\n         And grace, I've won to? Nay,\r\n         Such fortune ne'er a day\r\n     Believed me were; whence all afire am I,\r\n     Hiding the source of my liesse thereby.\r\n\r\nThis was the end of Pamfilo's song, whereto albeit it had been\r\ncompletely responded of all, there was none but noted the words\r\nthereof with more attent solicitude than pertained unto him, studying\r\nto divine that which, as he sang, it behoved him to keep hidden from\r\nthem; and although sundry went imagining various things, nevertheless\r\nnone happened upon the truth of the case.[422] But the queen, seeing\r\nthat the song was ended and that both young ladies and men would\r\ngladly rest themselves, commanded that all should betake themselves to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 422: The song sung by Pamfilo (under which name, as I have\r\nbefore pointed out, the author appears to represent himself)\r\napparently alludes to Boccaccio's amours with the Princess Maria of\r\nNaples (Fiammetta), by whom his passion was returned in kind.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE ENDETH THE EIGHTH DAY\r\nOF THE DECAMERON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Day the Ninth_\r\n\r\n     HERE BEGINNETH THE NINTH DAY OF THE DECAMERON WHEREIN UNDER\r\n     THE GOVERNANCE OF EMILIA EACH DISCOURSETH ACCORDING AS IT\r\n     PLEASETH HIM AND OF THAT WHICH IS MOST TO HIS LIKING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe light, from whose resplendence the night fleeth, had already\r\nchanged all the eighth heaven[423] from azure to watchet-colour[424]\r\nand the flowerets began to lift their heads along the meads, when\r\nEmilia, uprising, let call the ladies her comrades and on like wise\r\nthe young men, who, being come, fared forth, ensuing the slow steps of\r\nthe queen, and betook themselves to a coppice but little distant from\r\nthe palace. Therein entering, they saw the animals, wild goats and\r\ndeer and others, as if assured of security from the hunters by reason\r\nof the prevailing pestilence, stand awaiting them no otherwise than as\r\nthey were grown without fear or tame, and diverted themselves awhile\r\nwith them, drawing near, now to this one and now to that, as if they\r\nwould fain lay hands on them, and making them run and skip. But, the\r\nsun now waxing high, they deemed it well to turn back. They were all\r\ngarlanded with oak leaves, with their hands full of flowers and\r\nsweet-scented herbs, and whoso encountered them had said no otherwhat\r\nthan \"Or these shall not be overcome of death or it will slay them\r\nmerry.\" On this wise, then, they fared on, step by step, singing and\r\nchatting and laughing, till they came to the palace, where they found\r\neverything orderly disposed and their servants full of mirth and\r\njoyous cheer. There having rested awhile, they went not to dinner till\r\nhalf a dozen canzonets, each merrier than other, had been carolled by\r\nthe young men and the ladies; then, water being given to their hands,\r\nthe seneschal seated them all at table, according to the queen's\r\npleasure, and the viands being brought, they all ate blithely. Rising\r\nthence, they gave themselves awhile to dancing and music-making, and\r\nafter, by the queen's commandment, whoso would betook himself to rest.\r\nBut presently, the wonted hour being come, all in the accustomed place\r\nassembled to discourse, whereupon the queen, looking at Filomena, bade\r\nher give commencement to the stories of that day, and she, smiling,\r\nbegan on this wise:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 423: According to the Ptolemaic system, the earth is\r\nencompassed by eight celestial zones or heavens; the first or highest,\r\nabove which is the empyrean, (otherwise called the ninth heaven,) is\r\nthat of the Moon, the second that of Mercury, the third that of Venus,\r\nthe fourth that of the Sun, the fifth that of Mars, the sixth that of\r\nJupiter, the seventh that of Saturn and the eighth or lowest that of\r\nthe fixed stars and of the Earth.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 424: _D'azzurrino in color cilestro._ This is one of the\r\nmany passages in which Boccaccio has imitated Dante (cf. Purgatorio,\r\nc. xxvi. II. 4-6, \"... il sole.... Che già, raggiando, tutto\r\nl'occidente Mutava in bianco aspetto di cilestro,\") and also one of\r\nthe innumerable instances in which former translators (who all agree\r\nin making the advent of the light change the colour of the sky from\r\nazure to a darker colour, instead of, as Boccaccio intended, to\r\nwatchet, _i.e._ a paler or greyish blue,) have misrendered the text,\r\nfor sheer ignorance of the author's meaning.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Ninth]\r\n\r\n     MADAM FRANCESCA, BEING COURTED BY ONE RINUCCIO PALERMINI AND\r\n     ONE ALESSANDRO CHIARMONTESI AND LOVING NEITHER THE ONE NOR\r\n     THE OTHER, ADROITLY RIDDETH HERSELF OF BOTH BY CAUSING ONE\r\n     ENTER FOR DEAD INTO A SEPULCHRE AND THE OTHER BRING HIM\r\n     FORTH THEREOF FOR DEAD, ON SUCH WISE THAT THEY CANNOT AVAIL\r\n     TO ACCOMPLISH THE CONDITION IMPOSED\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Since it is your pleasure, madam, I am well pleased to be she who\r\nshall run the first ring in this open and free field of story-telling,\r\nwherein your magnificence hath set us; the which an I do well, I doubt\r\nnot but that those who shall come after will do well and better. Many\r\na time, charming ladies, hath it been shown in our discourses what\r\nand how great is the power of love; natheless, for that medeemeth not\r\nit hath been fully spoken thereof (no, nor would be, though we should\r\nspeak of nothing else for a year to come,) and that not only doth love\r\nbring lovers into divers dangers of death, but causeth them even to\r\nenter for dead into the abiding-places of the dead, it is my pleasure\r\nto relate to you a story thereof, over and above those which have been\r\ntold, whereby not only will you apprehend the puissance of love, but\r\nwill know the wit used by a worthy lady in ridding herself of two who\r\nloved her against her will.\r\n\r\nYou must know, then, that there was once in the city of Pistoia a very\r\nfair widow lady, of whom two of our townsmen, called the one Rinuccio\r\nPalermini and the other Alessandro Chiarmontesi, there abiding by\r\nreason of banishment from Florence, were, without knowing one of\r\nother, passionately enamoured, having by chance fallen in love with\r\nher and doing privily each his utmost endeavour to win her favour. The\r\ngentlewoman in question, whose name was Madam Francesca de' Lazzari,\r\nbeing still importuned of the one and the other with messages and\r\nentreaties, to which she had whiles somewhat unwisely given ear, and\r\ndesiring, but in vain, discreetly to retract, bethought herself how\r\nshe might avail to rid herself of their importunity by requiring them\r\nof a service, which, albeit it was possible, she conceived that\r\nneither of them would render her, to the intent that, they not doing\r\nthat which she required, she might have a fair and colourable occasion\r\nof refusing to hearken more to their messages; and the device which\r\noccurred to her was on this wise.\r\n\r\nThere had died that very day at Pistoia, one, who, albeit his\r\nancestors were gentlemen, was reputed the worst man that was, not only\r\nin Pistoia, but in all the world; more by token that he was in his\r\nlifetime so misshapen and of so monstrous a favour that whoso knew him\r\nnot, seeing him for the first time, had been affeared of him; and he\r\nhad been buried in a tomb without the church of the Minor Friars. This\r\ncircumstance she bethought herself would in part be very apt to her\r\npurpose and accordingly she said to a maid of hers, 'Thou knowest the\r\nannoy and the vexation I suffer all day long by the messages of yonder\r\ntwo Florentines, Rinuccio and Alessandro. Now I am not disposed to\r\ngratify [either of] them with my love, and to rid myself of them, I\r\nhave bethought myself, for the great proffers that they make, to seek\r\nto make proof of them in somewhat which I am certain they will not do;\r\nso shall I do away from me this their importunity, and thou shalt see\r\nhow. Thou knowest that Scannadio,[425] for so was the wicked man\r\ncalled of whom we have already spoken, 'was this morning buried in the\r\nburial-place of the Minor Brethren, Scannadio, of whom, whenas they\r\nsaw him alive, let alone dead, the doughtiest men of this city went in\r\nfear; wherefore go thou privily first to Alessandro and bespeak him,\r\nsaying, \"Madam Francesca giveth thee to know that now is the time\r\ncome whenas thou mayst have her love, which thou hast so much\r\ndesired, and be with her, an thou wilt, on this wise. This night, for\r\na reason which thou shalt know after, the body of Scannadio, who was\r\nthis morning buried, is to be brought to her house by a kinsman of\r\nhers, and she, being in great fear of him, dead though he be, would\r\nfain not have him there; wherefore she prayeth thee that it please\r\nthee, by way of doing her a great service, go this evening, at the\r\ntime of the first sleep, to the tomb wherein he is buried, and donning\r\nthe dead man's clothes, abide as thou wert he until such time as they\r\nshall come for thee. Then, without moving or speaking, thou must\r\nsuffer thyself be taken up out of the tomb and carried to her house,\r\nwhere she will receive thee, and thou mayst after abide with her and\r\ndepart at thy leisure, leaving to her the care of the rest.\" An he say\r\nthat he will do it, well and good; but, should he refuse, bid him on\r\nmy part, never more show himself whereas I may be and look, as he\r\nvalueth his life, that he send me no more letters or messages. Then\r\nshalt thou betake thee to Rinuccio Palermini and say to him, \"Madam\r\nFrancesca saith that she is ready to do thine every pleasure, an thou\r\nwilt render her a great service, to wit, that to-night, towards the\r\nmiddle hour, thou get thee to the tomb wherein Scannadio was this\r\nmorning buried and take him up softly thence and bring him to her at\r\nher house, without saying a word of aught thou mayst hear or feel.\r\nThere shalt thou learn what she would with him and have of her thy\r\npleasure; but, an it please thee not to do this, she chargeth thee\r\nnever more send her writ nor message.\"'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 425: _Scannadio_ signifies \"Murder-God\" and was no doubt a\r\nnickname bestowed upon the dead man, on account of his wicked and\r\nreprobate way of life.]\r\n\r\nThe maid betook herself to the two lovers and did her errand\r\npunctually to each, saying as it had been enjoined her; whereto each\r\nmade answer that, an it pleased her, they would go, not only into a\r\ntomb, but into hell itself. The maid carried their reply to the lady\r\nand she waited to see if they would be mad enough to do it. The night\r\ncome, whenas it was the season of the first sleep, Alessandro\r\nChiarmontesi, having stripped himself to his doublet, went forth of\r\nhis house to take Scannadio's place in the tomb; but, by the way,\r\nthere came a very frightful thought into his head and he fell a-saying\r\nin himself, 'Good lack, what a fool I am! Whither go I? How know I but\r\nyonder woman's kinsfolk, having maybe perceived that I love her and\r\nbelieving that which is not, have caused me do this, so they may\r\nslaughter me in yonder tomb? An it should happen thus, I should suffer\r\nfor it nor would aught in the world be ever known thereof to their\r\ndetriment. Or what know I but maybe some enemy of mine hath procured\r\nme this, whom she belike loveth and seeketh to oblige therein?' Then\r\nsaid he, 'But, grant that neither of these things be and that her\r\nkinsfolk are e'en for carrying me to her house, I must believe that\r\nthey want not Scannadio's body to hold it in their arms or to put it\r\nin hers; nay, it is rather to be conceived that they mean to do it\r\nsome mischief, as the body of one who maybe disobliged them in\r\nsomewhat aforetime. She saith that I am not to say a word for aught\r\nthat I may feel. But, should they put out mine eyes or draw my teeth\r\nor lop off my hands or play me any other such trick, how shall I do?\r\nHow could I abide quiet? And if I speak, they will know me and mayhap\r\ndo me a mischief, or, though they do me no hurt, yet shall I have\r\naccomplished nothing, for that they will not leave me with the lady;\r\nwhereupon she will say that I have broken her commandment and will\r\nnever do aught to pleasure me.' So saying, he had well nigh returned\r\nhome; but, nevertheless, his great love urged him on with counter\r\narguments of such potency that they brought him to the tomb, which he\r\nopened and entering therein, stripped Scannadio of his clothes; then,\r\ndonning them and shutting the tomb upon himself, he laid himself in\r\nthe dead man's place. Thereupon he began to call to mind what manner\r\nof man the latter had been and remembering him of all the things\r\nwhereof he had aforetime heard tell as having befallen by night, not\r\nto say in the sepulchres of the dead, but even otherwhere, his every\r\nhair began to stand on end and himseemed each moment as if Scannadio\r\nshould rise upright and butcher him then and there. However, aided by\r\nhis ardent love, he got the better of these and the other fearful\r\nthoughts that beset him and abiding as he were the dead man, he fell\r\nto awaiting that which should betide him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Rinuccio, midnight being now at hand, departed his house,\r\nto do that which had been enjoined him of his mistress, and as he\r\nwent, he entered into many and various thoughts of the things which\r\nmight possibly betide him; as, to wit, that he might fall into the\r\nhands of the police, with Scannadio's body on his shoulders, and be\r\ndoomed to the fire as a sorcerer, and that he should, an the thing\r\ncame to be known, incur the ill-will of his kinsfolk, and other like\r\nthoughts, whereby he was like to have been deterred. But after,\r\nbethinking himself again, 'Alack,' quoth he, 'shall I deny this\r\ngentlewoman, whom I have so loved and love, the first thing she\r\nrequireth of me, especially as I am thereby to gain her favour? God\r\nforbid, though I were certainly to die thereof, but I should set\r\nmyself to do that which I have promised!' Accordingly, he went on and\r\npresently coming to the sepulchre, opened it easily; which Alessandro\r\nhearing, abode still, albeit he was in great fear. Rinuccio, entering\r\nin and thinking to take Scannadio's body, laid hold of Alessandro's\r\nfeet and drew him forth of the tomb; then, hoisting him on his\r\nshoulders, he made off towards the lady's house.\r\n\r\nGoing thus and taking no manner of heed to his burden, he jolted it\r\nmany a time now against one corner and now another of certain benches\r\nthat were beside the way, more by token that the night was so cloudy\r\nand so dark he could not see whither he went. He was already well nigh\r\nat the door of the gentlewoman, who had posted herself at the window\r\nwith her maid, to see if he would bring Alessandro, and was ready\r\narmed with an excuse to send them both away, when it chanced that the\r\nofficers of the watch, who were ambushed in the street and abode\r\nsilently on the watch to lay hands upon a certain outlaw, hearing the\r\nscuffling that Rinuccio made with his feet, suddenly put out a light,\r\nto see what was to do and whither to go, and rattled their targets and\r\nhalberds, crying, 'Who goeth there?' Rinuccio, seeing this and having\r\nscant time for deliberation, let fall his burden and made off as fast\r\nas his legs would carry him; whereupon Alessandro arose in haste and\r\nmade off in his turn, for all he was hampered with the dead man's\r\nclothes, which were very long. The lady, by the light of the lantern\r\nput out by the police, had plainly recognized Rinuccio, with\r\nAlessandro on his shoulders, and perceiving the latter to be clad in\r\nScannadio's clothes, marvelled amain at the exceeding hardihood of\r\nboth; but, for all her wonderment, she laughed heartily to see\r\nAlessandro cast down on the ground and to see him after take to\r\nflight. Then, rejoiced at this accident and praising God that He had\r\nrid her of the annoy of these twain, she turned back into the house\r\nand betook herself to her chamber, avouching to her maid that without\r\ndoubt they both loved her greatly, since, as it appeared, they had\r\ndone that which she had enjoined them.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Rinuccio, woeful and cursing his ill fortune, for all that\r\nreturned not home, but, as soon as the watch had departed the\r\nneighbourhood, he came back whereas he had dropped Alessandro and\r\ngroped about, to see if he could find him again, so he might make an\r\nend of his service; but, finding him not and concluding that the\r\npolice had carried him off, he returned to his own house, woebegone,\r\nwhilst Alessandro, unknowing what else to do, made off home on like\r\nwise, chagrined at such a misadventure and without having recognized\r\nhim who had borne him thither. On the morrow, Scannadio's tomb being\r\nfound open and his body not to be seen, for that Alessandro had rolled\r\nit to the bottom of the vault, all Pistoia was busy with various\r\nconjectures anent the matter, and the simpler sort concluded that he\r\nhad been carried off by the devils. Nevertheless, each of the two\r\nlovers signified to the lady that which he had done and what had\r\nbefallen and excusing himself withal for not having full accomplished\r\nher commandment, claimed her favour and her love; but she, making\r\nbelieve to credit neither of this, rid herself of them with a curt\r\nresponse to the effect that she would never consent to do aught for\r\nthem, since they had not done that which she had required of them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Ninth]\r\n\r\n     AN ABBESS, ARISING IN HASTE AND IN THE DARK TO FIND ONE OF\r\n     HER NUNS, WHO HAD BEEN DENOUNCED TO HER, IN BED WITH HER\r\n     LOVER AND THINKING TO COVER HER HEAD WITH HER COIF, DONNETH\r\n     INSTEAD THEREOF THE BREECHES OF A PRIEST WHO IS ABED WITH\r\n     HER; THE WHICH THE ACCUSED NUN OBSERVING AND MAKING HER\r\n     AWARE THEREOF, SHE IS ACQUITTED AND HATH LEISURE TO BE WITH\r\n     HER LOVER\r\n\r\n\r\nFilomena was now silent and the lady's address in ridding herself of\r\nthose whom she chose not to love having been commended of all, whilst,\r\non the other hand, the presumptuous hardihood of the two gallants was\r\nheld of them to be not love, but madness, the queen said gaily to\r\nElisa, \"Elisa, follow on.\" Accordingly, she promptly began,\r\n\"Adroitly, indeed, dearest ladies, did Madam Francesca contrive to rid\r\nherself of her annoy, as hath been told; but a young nun, fortune\r\naiding her, delivered herself with an apt speech from an imminent\r\nperil. As you know, there be many very dull folk, who set up for\r\nteachers and censors of others, but whom, as you may apprehend from my\r\nstory, fortune bytimes deservedly putteth to shame, as befell the\r\nabbess, under whose governance was the nun of whom I have to tell.\r\n\r\nYou must know, then, that there was once in Lombardy a convent, very\r\nfamous for sanctity and religion, wherein, amongst the other nuns who\r\nwere there, was a young lady of noble birth and gifted with marvellous\r\nbeauty, who was called Isabetta and who, coming one day to the grate\r\nto speak with a kinsman of hers, fell in love with a handsome young\r\nman who accompanied him. The latter, seeing her very fair and divining\r\nher wishes with his eyes, became on like wise enamoured of her, and\r\nthis love they suffered a great while without fruit, to the no small\r\nunease of each. At last, each being solicited by a like desire, the\r\nyoung man hit upon a means of coming at his nun in all secrecy, and\r\nshe consenting thereto, he visited her, not once, but many times, to\r\nthe great contentment of both. But, this continuing, it chanced one\r\nnight that he was, without the knowledge of himself or his mistress,\r\nseen of one of the ladies of the convent to take leave of Isabetta and\r\ngo his ways. The nun communicated her discovery to divers others and\r\nthey were minded at first to denounce Isabetta to the abbess, who was\r\ncalled Madam Usimbalda and who, in the opinion of the nuns and of\r\nwhosoever knew her, was a good and pious lady; but, on consideration,\r\nthey bethought themselves to seek to have the abbess take her with the\r\nyoung man, so there might be no room for denial. Accordingly, they\r\nheld their peace and kept watch by turns in secret to surprise her.\r\n\r\nNow it chanced that Isabetta, suspecting nothing of this nor being on\r\nher guard, caused her lover come thither one night, which was\r\nforthright known to those who were on the watch for this and who,\r\nwhenas it seemed to them time, a good part of the night being spent,\r\ndivided themselves into two parties, whereof one abode on guard at the\r\ndoor of her cell, whilst the other ran to the abbess's chamber and\r\nknocking at the door, till she answered, said to her, 'Up, madam;\r\narise quickly, for we have discovered that Isabetta hath a young man\r\nin her cell.' Now the abbess was that night in company with a priest,\r\nwhom she ofttimes let come to her in a chest; but, hearing the nuns'\r\noutcry and fearing lest, of their overhaste and eagerness, they should\r\npush open the door, she hurriedly arose and dressed herself as best\r\nshe might in the dark. Thinking to take certain plaited veils, which\r\nnuns wear on their heads and call a psalter, she caught up by chance\r\nthe priest's breeches, and such was her haste that, without remarking\r\nwhat she did, she threw them over her head, in lieu of the psalter,\r\nand going forth, hurriedly locked the door after her, saying, 'Where\r\nis this accursed one of God?' Then, in company with the others, who\r\nwere so ardent and so intent upon having Isabetta taken in default\r\nthat they noted not that which the abbess had on her head, she came\r\nto the cell-door and breaking it open, with the aid of the others,\r\nentered and found the two lovers abed in each other's arms, who, all\r\nconfounded at such a surprise, abode fast, unknowing what to do.\r\n\r\nThe young lady was incontinent seized by the other nuns and haled off,\r\nby command of the abbess, to the chapter-house, whilst her gallant\r\ndressed himself and abode await to see what should be the issue of the\r\nadventure, resolved, if any hurt were offered to his mistress, to do a\r\nmischief to as many nuns as he could come at and carry her off. The\r\nabbess, sitting in chapter, proceeded, in the presence of all the\r\nnuns, who had no eyes but for the culprit, to give the latter the\r\nfoulest rating that ever woman had, as having by her lewd and filthy\r\npractices (an the thing should come to be known without the walls)\r\nsullied the sanctity, the honour and the fair fame of the convent; and\r\nto this she added very grievous menaces. The young lady, shamefast and\r\nfearful, as feeling herself guilty, knew not what to answer and\r\nkeeping silence, possessed the other nuns with compassion for her.\r\nHowever, after a while, the abbess multiplying words, she chanced to\r\nraise her eyes and espied that which the former had on her head and\r\nthe hose-points that hung down therefrom on either side; whereupon,\r\nguessing how the matter stood, she was all reassured and said, 'Madam,\r\nGod aid you, tie up your coif and after say what you will to me.'\r\n\r\nThe abbess, taking not her meaning, answered, 'What coif, vile woman\r\nthat thou art? Hast thou the face to bandy pleasantries at such a\r\ntime? Thinkest thou this that thou hast done is a jesting matter?'\r\n'Prithee, madam,' answered Isabetta, 'tie up your coif and after say\r\nwhat you will to me.' Thereupon many of the nuns raised their eyes to\r\nthe abbess's head and she also, putting her hand thereto, perceived,\r\nas did the others, why Isabetta spoke thus; wherefore the abbess,\r\nbecoming aware of her own default and perceiving that it was seen of\r\nall, past hope of recoverance, changed her note and proceeding to\r\nspeak after a fashion altogether different from her beginning, came to\r\nthe conclusion that it is impossible to withstand the pricks of the\r\nflesh, wherefore she said that each should, whenas she might, privily\r\ngive herself a good time, even as it had been done until that day.\r\nAccordingly, setting the young lady free, she went back to sleep with\r\nher priest and Isabetta returned to her lover, whom many a time\r\nthereafter she let come thither, in despite of those who envied her,\r\nwhilst those of the others who were loverless pushed their fortunes in\r\nsecret, as best they knew.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Ninth]\r\n\r\n     MASTER SIMONE, AT THE INSTANCE OF BRUNO AND BUFFALMACCO AND\r\n     NELLO, MAKETH CALANDRINO BELIEVE THAT HE IS WITH CHILD;\r\n     WHEREFORE HE GIVETH THEM CAPONS AND MONEY FOR MEDICINES AND\r\n     RECOVERETH WITHOUT BRINGING FORTH\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Elisa had finished her story and all the ladies had returned\r\nthanks to God, who had with a happy issue delivered the young nun from\r\nthe claws of her envious companions, the queen bade Filostrato follow\r\non, and he, without awaiting further commandment, began, \"Fairest\r\nladies, the unmannerly lout of a Marchegan judge, of whom I told you\r\nyesterday, took out of my mouth a story of Calandrino and his\r\ncompanions, which I was about to relate; and for that, albeit it hath\r\nbeen much discoursed of him and them, aught that is told of him cannot\r\ndo otherwise than add to our merriment, I will e'en tell you that\r\nwhich I had then in mind.\r\n\r\nIt hath already been clearly enough shown who Calandrino was and who\r\nwere the others of whom I am to speak in this story, wherefore,\r\nwithout further preface, I shall tell you that an aunt of his chanced\r\nto die and left him two hundred crowns in small coin; whereupon he\r\nfell a-talking of wishing to buy an estate and entered into treaty\r\nwith all the brokers in Florence, as if he had ten thousand gold\r\nflorins to expend; but the matter still fell through, when they came\r\nto the price of the estate in question. Bruno and Buffalmacco, knowing\r\nall this, had told him once and again that he were better spend the\r\nmoney in making merry together with them than go buy land, as if he\r\nhad had to make pellets;[426] but, far from this, they had never even\r\navailed to bring him to give them once to eat. One day, as they were\r\ncomplaining of this, there came up a comrade of theirs, a painter by\r\nname Nello, and they all three took counsel together how they might\r\nfind a means of greasing their gullets at Calandrino's expense;\r\nwherefore, without more delay, having agreed among themselves of that\r\nwhich was to do, they watched next morning for his coming forth of his\r\nhouse, nor had he gone far when Nello accosted him, saying, 'Good-day,\r\nCalandrino.' Calandrino answered God give him good day and good year,\r\nand Nello, halting awhile, fell to looking him in the face; whereupon\r\nCalandrino asked him, 'At what lookest thou?' Quoth the painter, 'Hath\r\naught ailed thee this night? Meseemeth thou are not thyself this\r\nmorning.' Calandrino incontinent began to quake and said, 'Alack, how\r\nso? What deemest thou aileth me?' 'Egad,' answered Nello, 'as for that\r\nI can't say; but thou seemest to me all changed; belike it is\r\nnothing.' So saying, he let him pass, and Calandrino fared on, all\r\nmisdoubtful, albeit he felt no whit ailing; but Buffalmacco, who was\r\nnot far off, seeing him quit of Nello, made for him and saluting him,\r\nenquired if aught ailed him. Quoth Calandrino, 'I know not; nay, Nello\r\ntold me but now that I seemed to him all changed. Can it be that aught\r\naileth me?' 'Ay,' rejoined Buffalmacco, 'there must e'en be something\r\nor other amiss with thee, for thou appearest half dead.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 426: _i.e._ balls for a pellet bow, usually made out of\r\nclay. Bruno and Buffalmacco were punning upon the double meaning, land\r\nand earth (or clay), of the word _terra_.]\r\n\r\nBy this time it seemed to Calandrino that he had the fevers, when, lo,\r\nup came Bruno and the first thing he said was, 'Calandrino, what\r\nmanner of face is this?' Calandrino, hearing them all in the same\r\ntale, held it for certain that he was in an ill way and asked them,\r\nall aghast, 'what shall I do?' Quoth Bruno, 'Methinketh thou wert best\r\nreturn home and get thee to bed and cover thyself well and send thy\r\nwater to Master Simone the doctor, who is, as thou knowest, as our\r\nvery creature and will tell thee incontinent what thou must do. We\r\nwill go with thee and if it behoveth to do aught, we will do it.'\r\nAccordingly, Nello having joined himself to them, they returned home\r\nwith Calandrino, who betook himself, all dejected, into the bedchamber\r\nand said to his wife, 'Come, cover me well, for I feel myself sore\r\ndisordered.' Then, laying himself down, he despatched his water by a\r\nlittle maid to Master Simone, who then kept shop in the Old Market, at\r\nthe sign of the Pumpkin, whilst Bruno said to his comrades, 'Abide you\r\nhere with him, whilst I go hear what the doctor saith and bring him\r\nhither, if need be.' 'Ay, for God's sake, comrade mine,' cried\r\nCalandrino, 'go thither and bring me back word how the case standeth,\r\nfor I feel I know not what within me.'\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Bruno posted off to Master Simone and coming thither\r\nbefore the girl who brought the water, acquainted him with the case;\r\nwherefore, the maid being come and the physician, having seen the\r\nwater, he said to her, 'Begone and bid Calandrino keep himself well\r\nwarm, and I will come to him incontinent and tell him that which\r\naileth him and what he must do.' The maid reported this to her master\r\nnor was it long before the physician and Bruno came, whereupon the\r\nformer, seating himself beside Calandrino, fell to feeling his pulse\r\nand presently, the patient's wife being there present, he said,\r\n'Harkye, Calandrino, to speak to thee as a friend, there aileth thee\r\nnought but that thou art with child.' When Calandrino heard this, he\r\nfell a-roaring for dolour and said, 'Woe's me! Tessa, this is thy\r\ndoing, for that thou wilt still be uppermost; I told thee how it would\r\nbe.' The lady, who was a very modest person, hearing her husband speak\r\nthus, blushed all red for shamefastness and hanging her head, went out\r\nof the room, without answering a word; whilst Calandrino, pursuing his\r\ncomplaint, said, 'Alack, wretch that I am! How shall I do? How shall I\r\nbring forth this child? Whence shall he issue? I see plainly I am a\r\ndead man, through the mad lust of yonder wife of mine, whom God make\r\nas woeful as I would fain be glad! Were I as well as I am not, I would\r\narise and deal her so many and such buffets that I would break every\r\nbone in her body; albeit it e'en serveth me right, for that I should\r\nnever have suffered her get the upper hand; but, for certain, an I\r\ncome off alive this time, she may die of desire ere she do it again.'\r\n\r\nBruno and Buffalmacco and Nello were like to burst with laughter,\r\nhearing Calandrino's words; however, they contained themselves, but\r\nDoctor Simple-Simon[427] laughed so immoderately that you might have\r\ndrawn every tooth in his head. Finally, Calandrino commending himself\r\nto the physician and praying him give him aid and counsel in this his\r\nstrait, the latter said to him, 'Calandrino, I will not have thee lose\r\nheart; for, praised be God, we have taken the case so betimes that, in\r\na few days and with a little trouble, I will deliver thee thereof; but\r\nit will cost thee some little expense.' 'Alack, doctor mine,' cried\r\nCalandrino, 'ay, for the love of God, do it! I have here two hundred\r\ncrowns, wherewith I was minded to buy me an estate; take them all, if\r\nneed be, so I be not brought to bed; for I know not how I should do,\r\nseeing I hear women make such a terrible outcry, whereas they are\r\nabout to bear child, for all they have ample commodity therefor, that\r\nmethinketh, if I had that pain to suffer, I should die ere I came to\r\nthe bringing forth.' Quoth the doctor, 'Have no fear of that; I will\r\nlet make thee a certain ptisan of distilled waters, very good and\r\npleasant to drink, which will in three mornings' time carry off\r\neverything and leave thee sounder than a fish; but look thou be more\r\ndiscreet for the future and suffer not thyself fall again into these\r\nfollies. Now for this water it behoveth us have three pairs of fine\r\nfat capons, and for other things that are required thereanent, do thou\r\ngive one of these (thy comrades) five silver crowns, so he may buy\r\nthem, and let carry everything to my shop; and to-morrow, in God's\r\nname, I will send thee the distilled water aforesaid, whereof thou\r\nshalt proceed to drink a good beakerful at a time.' 'Doctor mine,'\r\nreplied Calandrino, 'I put myself in your hands'; and giving Bruno\r\nfive crowns and money for three pairs of capons, he besought him to\r\noblige him by taking the pains to buy these things.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 427: _Scimmione_ (lit. ape), a contemptuous distortion of\r\n_Simone_.]\r\n\r\nThe physician then took his leave and letting make a little\r\nclary,[428] despatched it to Calandrino, whilst Bruno, buying the\r\ncapons and other things necessary for making good cheer, ate them in\r\ncompany with his comrades and Master Simone. Calandrino drank of his\r\nclary three mornings, after which the doctor came to him, together\r\nwith his comrades, and feeling his pulse, said to him, 'Calandrino,\r\nthou art certainly cured; wherefore henceforth thou mayst safely go\r\nabout thine every business nor abide longer at home for this.'\r\nAccordingly, Calandrino arose, overjoyed, and went about his\r\noccasions, mightily extolling, as often as he happened to speak with\r\nany one, the fine cure that Master Simone had wrought of him, in that\r\nhe had unbegotten him with child in three days' time, without any\r\npain; whilst Bruno and Buffalmacco and Nello abode well pleased at\r\nhaving contrived with this device to overreach his niggardliness,\r\nalbeit Dame Tessa, smoking the cheat, rated her husband amain\r\nthereanent.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 428: _Chiarea._ According to the commentators, the\r\ncomposition of this drink is unknown, but that of clary, a sort of\r\nhippocras or spiced wine _clear-strained_ (whence the name), offers no\r\ndifficulty to the student of old English literature.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Ninth]\r\n\r\n     CECCO FORTARRIGO GAMETH AWAY AT BUONCONVENTO ALL HIS GOOD\r\n     AND THE MONIES OF CECCO ANGIOLIERI [HIS MASTER;] MOREOVER,\r\n     RUNNING AFTER THE LATTER, IN HIS SHIRT, AND AVOUCHING THAT\r\n     HE HATH ROBBED HIM, HE CAUSETH HIM BE TAKEN OF THE\r\n     COUNTRYFOLK; THEN, DONNING ANGIOLIERI'S CLOTHES AND MOUNTING\r\n     HIS PALFREY, HE MAKETH OFF AND LEAVETH THE OTHER IN HIS\r\n     SHIRT\r\n\r\n\r\nCalandrino's speech concerning his wife had been hearkened of all the\r\ncompany with the utmost laughter; then, Filostrato being silent,\r\nNeifile, as the queen willed it, began, \"Noble ladies, were it not\r\nuneather for men to show forth unto others their wit and their worth\r\nthan it is for them to exhibit their folly and their vice, many would\r\nweary themselves in vain to put a bridle on their tongues; and this\r\nhath right well been made manifest to you by the folly of Calandrino,\r\nwho had no call, in seeking to be made whole of the ailment in which\r\nhis simplicity caused him believe, to publish the privy diversions of\r\nhis wife; and this hath brought to my mind somewhat of contrary\r\npurport to itself, to wit, a story of how one man's knavery got the\r\nbetter of another's wit, to the grievous hurt and confusion of the\r\nover-reached one, the which it pleaseth me to relate to you.\r\n\r\nThere were, then, in Siena, not many years ago, two (as far as age\r\nwent) full-grown men, each of whom was called Cecco. One was the son\r\nof Messer Angiolieri and the other of Messer Fortarrigo, and albeit in\r\nmost other things they sorted ill of fashions one with the other, they\r\nwere natheless so far of accord in one particular, to wit, that they\r\nwere both hated of their fathers, that they were by reason thereof\r\ngrown friends and companied often together. After awhile, Angiolieri,\r\nwho was both a handsome man and a well-mannered, himseeming he could\r\nill live at Siena of the provision assigned him of his father and\r\nhearing that a certain cardinal, a great patron of his, was come into\r\nthe Marches of Ancona as the Pope's Legate, determined to betake\r\nhimself to him, thinking thus to better his condition. Accordingly,\r\nacquainting his father with his purpose, he took order with him to\r\nhave at once that which he was to give him in six months, so he might\r\nclothe and horse himself and make an honourable figure. As he went\r\nseeking some one whom he might carry with him for his service, the\r\nthing came to Fortarrigo's knowledge, whereupon he presently repaired\r\nto Angiolieri and besought him, as best he knew, to carry him with\r\nhim, offering himself to be to him lackey and serving-man and all,\r\nwithout any wage beyond his expenses paid. Angiolieri answered that he\r\nwould nowise take him, not but he knew him to be right well sufficient\r\nunto every manner of service, but for that he was a gambler and\r\nbytimes a drunkard, to boot. But the other replied that he would\r\nwithout fail keep himself from both of these defaults and affirmed it\r\nunto him with oaths galore, adding so many prayers that Angiolieri was\r\nprevailed upon and said that he was content.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they both set out one morning and went to dine at\r\nBuonconvento, where, after dinner, the heat being great, Angiolieri\r\nlet make ready a bed at the inn and undressing himself, with\r\nFortarrigo's aid, went to sleep, charging the latter call him at the\r\nstroke of none. As soon as his master was asleep, Fortarrigo betook\r\nhimself to the tavern and there, after drinking awhile, he fell to\r\ngaming with certain men, who in a trice won of him some money he had\r\nand after, the very clothes he had on his back; whereupon, desirous of\r\nretrieving himself, he repaired, in his shirt as he was, to\r\nAngiolieri's chamber and seeing him fast asleep, took from his purse\r\nwhat monies he had and returning to play, lost these as he had lost\r\nthe others. Presently, Angiolieri awoke and arising, dressed himself\r\nand enquired for Fortarrigo. The latter was not to be found and\r\nAngiolieri, concluding him to be asleep, drunken, somewhere, as was\r\nbytimes his wont, determined to leave him be and get himself another\r\nservant at Corsignano. Accordingly, he caused put his saddle and his\r\nvalise on a palfrey he had and thinking to pay the reckoning, so he\r\nmight get him gone, found himself without a penny; whereupon great was\r\nthe outcry and all the hostelry was in an uproar, Angiolieri declaring\r\nthat he had been robbed there and threatening to have the host and all\r\nhis household carried prisoners to Siena.\r\n\r\nAt this moment up came Fortarrigo in his shirt, thinking to take his\r\nmaster's clothes, as he had taken his money, and seeing the latter\r\nready to mount, said, 'What is this, Angiolieri? Must we needs be gone\r\nalready? Good lack, wait awhile; there will be one here forthwith who\r\nhath my doublet in pawn for eight-and-thirty shillings; and I am\r\ncertain that he will render it up for five-and-thirty, money down.' As\r\nhe spoke, there came one who certified Angiolieri that it was\r\nFortarrigo who had robbed him of his monies, by showing him the sum of\r\nthose which the latter had lost at play; wherefore he was sore\r\nincensed and loaded Fortarrigo with reproaches; and had he not feared\r\nothers more than he feared God, he had done him a mischief; then,\r\nthreatening to have him strung up by the neck or outlawed from Siena,\r\nhe mounted to horse. Fortarrigo, as if he spoke not to him, but to\r\nanother, said, 'Good lack, Angiolieri, let be for the nonce this talk\r\nthat skilleth not a straw, and have regard unto this; by redeeming\r\nit[429] forthright, we may have it again for five-and-thirty\r\nshillings; whereas, if we tarry but till to-morrow, he will not take\r\nless than the eight-and-thirty he lent me thereon; and this favour he\r\ndoth me for that I staked it after his counsel. Marry, why should we\r\nnot better ourselves by these three shillings?'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 429: _i.e._ the doublet.]\r\n\r\nAngiolieri, hearing him talk thus, lost all patience (more by token\r\nthat he saw himself eyed askance by the bystanders, who manifestly\r\nbelieved, not that Fortarrigo had gamed away his monies, but that he\r\nhad yet monies of Fortarrigo's in hand) and said to him, 'What have I\r\nto do with thy doublet? Mayst thou be strung up by the neck, since not\r\nonly hast thou robbed me and gambled away my money, but hinderest me\r\nto boot in my journey, and now thou makest mock of me.' However,\r\nFortarrigo still stood to it, as it were not spoken to him and said,\r\n'Ecod, why wilt thou not better me these three shillings? Thinkest\r\nthou I shall not be able to oblige thee therewith another time?\r\nPrithee, do it, an thou have any regard for me. Why all this haste? We\r\nshall yet reach Torrenieri betimes this evening. Come, find the purse;\r\nthou knowest I might ransack all Siena and not find a doublet to suit\r\nme so well as this; and to think I should let yonder fellow have it\r\nfor eight-and-thirty shillings! It is worth yet forty shillings or\r\nmore, so that thou wouldst worsen me in two ways.'[430]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 430: _i.e._ do me a double injury.]\r\n\r\nAngiolieri, beyond measure exasperated to see himself first robbed and\r\nnow held in parley after this fashion, made him no further answer,\r\nbut, turning his palfrey's head, took the road to Torrenieri, whilst\r\nFortarrigo, bethinking himself of a subtle piece of knavery, proceeded\r\nto trot after him in his shirt good two miles, still requiring him of\r\nhis doublet. Presently, Angiolieri pricking on amain, to rid his ears\r\nof the annoy, Fortarrigo espied some husbandmen in a field, adjoining\r\nthe highway in advance of him, and cried out to them, saying, 'Stop\r\nhim, stop him!' Accordingly, they ran up, some with spades and others\r\nwith mattocks, and presenting themselves in the road before\r\nAngiolieri, concluding that he had robbed him who came crying after\r\nhim in his shirt, stopped and took him. It availed him little to tell\r\nthem who he was and how the case stood, and Fortarrigo, coming up,\r\nsaid with an angry air, 'I know not what hindereth me from slaying\r\nthee, disloyal thief that thou wast to make off with my gear!' Then,\r\nturning to the countrymen, 'See, gentlemen,' quoth he, 'in what a\r\nplight he left me at the inn, having first gamed away all his own! I\r\nmay well say by God and by you have I gotten back this much, and\r\nthereof I shall still be beholden to you.'\r\n\r\nAngiolieri told them his own story, but his words were not heeded;\r\nnay, Fortarrigo, with the aid of the countrymen, pulled him off his\r\npalfrey and stripping him, clad himself in his clothes; then, mounting\r\nto horse, he left him in his shirt and barefoot and returned to Siena,\r\navouching everywhere that he had won the horse and clothes of\r\nAngiolieri, whilst the latter, who had thought to go, as a rich man,\r\nto the cardinal in the Marches, returned to Buonconvento, poor and in\r\nhis shirt, nor dared for shamefastness go straight back to Siena, but,\r\nsome clothes being lent him, he mounted the rouncey that Fortarrigo\r\nhad ridden and betook himself to his kinsfolk at Corsignano, with whom\r\nhe abode till such time as he was furnished anew by his father. On\r\nthis wise Fortarrigo's knavery baffled Angiolieri's fair\r\nadvisement,[431] albeit his villainy was not left by the latter\r\nunpunished in due time and place.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 431: Syn. goodly design of foresight (_buono avviso_).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Ninth]\r\n\r\n     CALANDRINO FALLETH IN LOVE WITH A WENCH AND BRUNO WRITETH\r\n     HIM A TALISMAN, WHEREWITH WHEN HE TOUCHETH HER, SHE GOETH\r\n     WITH HIM; AND HIS WIFE FINDING THEM TOGETHER, THERE BETIDETH\r\n     HIM GRIEVOUS TROUBLE AND ANNOY\r\n\r\n\r\nNeifile's short story being finished and the company having passed it\r\nover without overmuch talk or laughter, the queen turned to Fiammetta\r\nand bade her follow on, to which she replied all blithely that she\r\nwould well and began, \"Gentlest ladies, there is, as methinketh you\r\nmay know, nothing, how much soever it may have been talked thereof,\r\nbut will still please, provided whoso is minded to speak of it know\r\nduly to choose the time and the place that befit it. Wherefore, having\r\nregard to our intent in being here (for that we are here to make merry\r\nand divert ourselves and not for otherwhat), meseemeth that everything\r\nwhich may afford mirth and pleasance hath here both due place and due\r\ntime; and albeit it may have been a thousand times discoursed thereof,\r\nit should natheless be none the less pleasing, though one speak of it\r\nas much again. Wherefore, notwithstanding it hath been many times\r\nspoken among us of the sayings and doings of Calandrino, I will make\r\nbold, considering, as Filostrato said awhile ago, that these are all\r\ndiverting, to tell you yet another story thereof, wherein were I\r\nminded to swerve from the fact, I had very well known to disguise and\r\nrecount it under other names; but, for that, in the telling of a\r\nstory, to depart from the truth of things betided detracteth greatly\r\nfrom the listener's pleasure, I will e'en tell it you in its true\r\nshape, moved by the reason aforesaid.\r\n\r\nNiccolo Cornacchini was a townsman of ours and a rich man and had,\r\namong his other possessions, a fine estate at Camerata, whereon he let\r\nbuild a magnificent mansion and agreed with Bruno and Buffalmacco to\r\npaint it all for him; and they, for that the work was great, joined to\r\nthemselves Nello and Calandrino and fell to work. Thither, for that\r\nthere was none of the family in the house, although there were one or\r\ntwo chambers furnished with beds and other things needful and an old\r\nserving-woman abode there, as guardian of the place, a son of the said\r\nNiccolo, by name Filippo, being young and without a wife, was wont\r\nbytimes to bring some wench or other for his diversion and keep her\r\nthere a day or two and after send her away. It chanced once, among\r\nother times, that he brought thither one called Niccolosa, whom a lewd\r\nfellow, by name Mangione, kept at his disposal in a house at Camaldoli\r\nand let out on hire. She was a woman of a fine person and well clad\r\nand for her kind well enough mannered and spoken.\r\n\r\nOne day at noontide, she having come forth her chamber in a white\r\npetticoat, with her hair twisted about her head, and being in act to\r\nwash her hands and face at a well that was in the courtyard of the\r\nmansion, it chanced that Calandrino came thither for water and saluted\r\nher familiarly. She returned him his greeting and fell to eying him,\r\nmore because he seemed to her an odd sort of fellow than for any fancy\r\nshe had for him; whereupon he likewise fell a-considering her and\r\nhimseeming she was handsome, he began to find his occasions for\r\nabiding there and returned not to his comrades with the water, but,\r\nknowing her not, dared not say aught to her. She, who had noted his\r\nlooking, glanced at him from time to time, to make game of him,\r\nheaving some small matter of sighs the while; wherefore Calandrino\r\nfell suddenly over head and ears in love with her and left not the\r\ncourtyard till she was recalled by Filippo into the chamber.\r\nTherewithal he returned to work, but did nought but sigh, which Bruno,\r\nwho had still an eye to his doings, for that he took great delight in\r\nhis fashions, remarking, 'What a devil aileth thee, friend\r\nCalandrino?' quoth he. 'Thou dost nought but sigh.' 'Comrade,'\r\nanswered Calandrino, 'had I but some one to help me, I should fare\r\nwell.' 'How so?' enquired Bruno; and Calandrino replied, 'It must not\r\nbe told to any; but there is a lass down yonder, fairer than a fairy,\r\nwho hath fallen so mightily in love with me that 'twould seem to thee\r\na grave matter. I noted it but now, whenas I went for the water.'\r\n'Ecod,' cried Bruno, 'look she be not Filippo's wife.' Quoth\r\nCalandrino, 'Methinketh it is she, for that he called her and she went\r\nto him in the chamber; but what of that? In matters of this kind I\r\nwould jockey Christ himself, let alone Filippo; and to tell thee the\r\ntruth, comrade, she pleaseth me more than I can tell thee.' 'Comrade,'\r\nanswered Bruno, 'I will spy thee out who she is, and if she be\r\nFilippo's wife, I will order thine affairs for thee in a brace of\r\nwords, for she is a great friend of mine. But how shall we do, so\r\nBuffalmacco may not know? I can never get a word with her, but he is\r\nwith me.' Quoth Calandrino, 'Of Buffalmacco I reck not; but we must\r\nbeware of Nello, for that he is Tessa's kinsman and would mar us\r\neverything.' And Bruno said, 'True.'\r\n\r\nNow he knew very well who the wench was, for that he had seen her come\r\nand moreover Filippo had told him. Accordingly, Calandrino having left\r\nwork awhile and gone to get a sight of her, Bruno told Nello and\r\nBuffalmacco everything and they took order together in secret what\r\nthey should do with him in the matter of this his enamourment. When he\r\ncame back, Bruno said to him softly, 'Hast seen her?' 'Alack, yes,'\r\nreplied Calandrino; 'she hath slain me.' Quoth Bruno, 'I must go see\r\nan it be she I suppose; and if it be so, leave me do.' Accordingly, he\r\nwent down into the courtyard and finding Filippo and Niccolosa there,\r\ntold them precisely what manner of man Calandrino was and took order\r\nwith them of that which each of them should do and say, so they might\r\ndivert themselves with the lovesick gull and make merry over his\r\npassion. Then, returning to Calandrino, he said, 'It is indeed she;\r\nwherefore needs must the thing be very discreetly managed, for, should\r\nFilippo get wind of it, all the water in the Arno would not wash us.\r\nBut what wouldst thou have me say to her on thy part, if I should\r\nchance to get speech of her?' 'Faith,' answered Calandrino, 'thou\r\nshalt tell her, to begin with, that I will her a thousand measures of\r\nthat good stuff that getteth with child, and after, that I am her\r\nservant and if she would have aught.... Thou takest me?' 'Ay,' said\r\nBruno, 'leave me do.'\r\n\r\nPresently, supper-time being come, the painters left work and went\r\ndown into the courtyard, where they found Filippo and Niccolosa and\r\ntarried there awhile, to oblige Calandrino. The latter fell to ogling\r\nNiccolosa and making the oddest grimaces in the world, such and so\r\nmany that a blind man would have remarked them. She on her side did\r\neverything that she thought apt to inflame him, and Filippo, in\r\naccordance with the instructions he had of Bruno, made believe to talk\r\nwith Buffalmacco and the others and to have no heed of this, whilst\r\ntaking the utmost diversion in Calandrino's fashions. However, after a\r\nwhile, to the latter's exceeding chagrin, they took their leave and as\r\nthey returned to Florence, Bruno said to Calandrino, 'I can tell thee\r\nthou makest her melt like ice in the sun. Cock's body, wert thou to\r\nfetch thy rebeck and warble thereto some of those amorous ditties of\r\nthine, thou wouldst cause her cast herself out of window to come to\r\nthee.' Quoth Calandrino, 'Deemest thou, gossip? Deemest thou I should\r\ndo well to fetch it?' 'Ay, do I,' answered Bruno; and Calandrino went\r\non, 'Thou wouldst not credit me this morning, whenas I told it thee;\r\nbut, for certain, gossip, methinketh I know better than any man alive\r\nto do what I will. Who, other than I, had known to make such a lady so\r\nquickly in love with me? Not your trumpeting young braggarts,[432] I\r\nwarrant you, who are up and down all day long and could not make\r\nshift, in a thousand years, to get together three handsful of cherry\r\nstones. I would fain have thee see me with the rebeck; 'twould be fine\r\nsport for thee. I will have thee to understand once for all that I am\r\nno dotard, as thou deemest me, and this she hath right well perceived,\r\nshe; but I will make her feel it othergates fashion, so once I get my\r\nclaw into her back; by the very body of Christ, I will lead her such a\r\ndance that she will run after me, as the madwoman after her child.'\r\n'Ay,' rejoined Bruno, 'I warrant me thou wilt rummage her; methinketh\r\nI see thee, with those teeth of thine that were made for virginal\r\njacks,[433] bite that little vermeil mouth of hers and those her\r\ncheeks, that show like two roses, and after eat her all up.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 432: _Giovani di tromba marina._ The sense seems as above;\r\nthe commentators say that _giovani di tromba marina_ is a name given\r\nto those youths who go trumpeting about everywhere the favours\r\naccorded them by women; but the _tromba marina_ is a _stringed_ (not a\r\nwind) _instrument_, a sort of primitive violoncello with one string.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 433: \"Your teeth did dance like virginal jacks.\"--_Ben\r\nJonson._]\r\n\r\nCalandrino, hearing this, fancied himself already at it and went\r\nsinging and skipping, so overjoyed that he was like to jump out of his\r\nskin. On the morrow, having brought the rebeck, he, to the great\r\ndiversion of all the company, sang sundry songs thereto; and in brief,\r\nhe was taken with such an itch for the frequent seeing of her that he\r\nwrought not a whit, but ran a thousand times a day, now to the window,\r\nnow to the door and anon into the courtyard, to get a look at her,\r\nwhereof she, adroitly carrying out Bruno's instructions, afforded him\r\nample occasion. Bruno, on his side, answered his messages in her name\r\nand bytimes brought him others as from her; and whenas she was not\r\nthere, which was mostly the case, he carried him letters from her,\r\nwherein she gave him great hopes of compassing his desire, feigning\r\nherself at home with her kinsfolk, where he might not presently see\r\nher. On this wise, Bruno, with the aid of Buffalmacco, who had a hand\r\nin the matter, kept the game afoot and had the greatest sport in the\r\nworld with Calandrino's antics, causing him give them bytimes, as at\r\nhis mistress's request, now an ivory comb, now a purse and anon a\r\nknife and such like toys, for which they brought him in return divers\r\npaltry counterfeit rings of no value, with which he was vastly\r\ndelighted; and to boot, they had of him, for their pains, store of\r\ndainty collations and other small matters of entertainment, so they\r\nmight be diligent about his affairs.\r\n\r\nOn this wise they kept him in play good two months, without getting a\r\nstep farther, at the end of which time, seeing the work draw to an end\r\nand bethinking himself that, an he brought not his amours to an issue\r\nin the meantime, he might never have another chance thereof, he began\r\nto urge and importune Bruno amain; wherefore, when next the girl came\r\nto the mansion, Bruno, having first taken order with her and Filippo\r\nof what was to be done, said to Calandrino, 'Harkye, gossip, yonder\r\nlady hath promised me a good thousand times to do that which thou\r\nwouldst have and yet doth nought thereof, and meseemeth she leadeth\r\nthee by the nose; wherefore, since she doth it not as she promiseth,\r\nwe will an it like thee, make her do it, will she, nill she.' 'Ecod,\r\nay!' answered Calandrino. 'For the love of God let it be done\r\nspeedily.' Quoth Bruno, 'Will thy heart serve thee to touch her with a\r\nscript I shall give thee?' 'Ay, sure,' replied Calandrino; and the\r\nother, 'Then do thou make shift to bring me a piece of virgin\r\nparchment and a live bat, together with three grains of frankincense\r\nand a candle that hath been blessed by the priest, and leave me do.'\r\nAccordingly, Calandrino lay in wait all the next night with his\r\nengines to catch a bat and having at last taken one, carried it to\r\nBruno, with the other things required; whereupon the latter,\r\nwithdrawing to a chamber, scribbled divers toys of his fashion upon\r\nthe parchment, in characters of his own devising, and brought it to\r\nhim, saying, 'Know, Calandrino, that, if thou touch her with this\r\nscript, she will incontinent follow thee and do what thou wilt.\r\nWherefore, if Filippo should go abroad anywhither to-day, do thou\r\ncontrive to accost her on some pretext or other and touch her; then\r\nbetake thyself to the barn yonder, which is the best place here for\r\nthy purpose, for that no one ever frequenteth there. Thou wilt find\r\nshe will come thither, and when she is there, thou knowest well what\r\nthou hast to do.' Calandrino was the joyfullest man alive and took the\r\nscript, saying, 'Gossip, leave me do.'\r\n\r\nNow Nello, whom Calandrino mistrusted, had as much diversion of the\r\nmatter as the others and bore a hand with them in making sport of him:\r\nwherefore, of accord with Bruno, he betook himself to Florence to\r\nCalandrino's wife and said to her, 'Tessa, thou knowest what a\r\nbeating Calandrino gave thee without cause the day he came back, laden\r\nwith stones from the Mugnone; wherefore I mean to have thee avenge\r\nthyself on him; and if thou do it not, hold me no more for kinsman or\r\nfor friend. He hath fallen in love with a woman over yonder, and she\r\nis lewd enough to go very often closeting herself with him. A little\r\nwhile agone, they appointed each other to foregather together this\r\nvery day; wherefore I would have thee come thither and lie in wait for\r\nhim and chastise him well.' When the lady heard this, it seemed to her\r\nno jesting matter, but, starting to her feet, she fell a-saying,\r\n'Alack, common thief that thou art, is it thus that thou usest me? By\r\nChrist His Cross, it shall not pass thus, but I will pay thee\r\ntherefor!' Then, taking her mantle and a little maid to bear her\r\ncompany, she started off at a good round pace for the mansion,\r\ntogether with Nello.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Bruno saw the latter afar off, he said to Filippo, 'Here\r\ncometh our friend'; whereupon the latter, betaking himself whereas\r\nCalandrino and the others were at work, said, 'Masters, needs must I\r\ngo presently to Florence; work with a will.' Then, going away, he hid\r\nhimself in a place when he could, without being seen, see what\r\nCalandrino should do. The latter, as soon as he deemed Filippo\r\nsomewhat removed, came down into the courtyard and finding Niccolosa\r\nthere alone, entered into talk with her, whilst she, who knew well\r\nenough what she had to do, drew near him and entreated him somewhat\r\nmore familiarly than of wont. Thereupon he touched her with the script\r\nand no sooner had he done so than he turned, without saying a word,\r\nand made for the barn, whither she followed him. As soon as she was\r\nwithin, she shut the door and taking him in her arms, threw him down\r\non the straw that was on the floor; then, mounting astride of him and\r\nholding him with her hands on his shoulders, without letting him draw\r\nnear her face, she gazed at him, as he were her utmost desire, and\r\nsaid, 'O sweet my Calandrino, heart of my body, my soul, my treasure,\r\nmy comfort, how long have I desired to have thee and to be able to\r\nhold thee at my wish! Thou hast drawn all the thread out of my shift\r\nwith thy gentilesse; thou hast tickled my heart with thy rebeck. Can\r\nit be true that I hold thee?' Calandrino, who could scarce stir, said,\r\n'For God's sake, sweet my soul, let me buss thee.' 'Marry,' answered\r\nshe, 'thou art in a mighty hurry. Let me first take my fill of looking\r\nupon thee; let me sate mine eyes with that sweet face of thine.'\r\n\r\nNow Bruno and Buffalmacco were come to join Filippo and all three\r\nheard and saw all this. As Calandrino was now offering to kiss\r\nNiccolosa perforce, up came Nello with Dame Tessa and said, as soon as\r\nhe reached the place, 'I vow to God they are together.' Then, coming\r\nup to the door of the barn, the lady, who was all a-fume with rage,\r\ndealt it such a push with her hands that she sent it flying, and\r\nentering, saw Niccolosa astride of Calandrino. The former, seeing the\r\nlady, started up in haste and taking to flight, made off to join\r\nFilippo, whilst Dame Tessa fell tooth and nail upon Calandrino, who\r\nwas still on his back, and clawed all his face; then, clutching him\r\nby the hair and haling him hither and thither, 'Thou sorry shitten\r\ncur,' quoth she, 'dost thou then use me thus? Besotted dotard that\r\nthou art, accursed be the weal I have willed thee! Marry, seemeth it\r\nto thee thou hast not enough to do at home, that thou must go\r\nwantoning it in other folk's preserves? A fine gallant, i'faith! Dost\r\nthou not know thyself, losel that thou art? Dost thou not know\r\nthyself, good for nought? Wert thou to be squeezed dry, there would\r\nnot come as much juice from thee as might suffice for a sauce. Cock's\r\nfaith, thou canst not say it was Tessa that was presently in act to\r\nget thee with child, God make her sorry, who ever she is, for a scurvy\r\ntrull as she must be to have a mind to so fine a jewel as thou!'\r\n\r\nCalandrino, seeing his wife come, abode neither dead nor alive and had\r\nnot the hardihood to make any defence against her; but, rising, all\r\nscratched and flayed and baffled as he was, and picking up his bonnet,\r\nhe fell to humbly beseeching her leave crying out, an she would not\r\nhave him cut in pieces, for that she who had been with him was the\r\nwife of the master of the house; whereupon quoth she, 'So be it, God\r\ngive her an ill year.' At this moment, Bruno and Buffalmacco, having\r\nlaughed their fill at all this, in company with Filippo and Niccolosa,\r\ncame up, feigning to be attracted by the clamour, and having with no\r\nlittle ado appeased the lady, counselled Calandrino betake himself to\r\nFlorence and return thither no more, lest Filippo should get wind of\r\nthe matter and do him a mischief. Accordingly he returned to Florence,\r\nchapfallen and woebegone, all flayed and scratched, and never ventured\r\nto go thither again; but, being plagued and harassed night and day\r\nwith his wife's reproaches, he made an end of his fervent love, having\r\ngiven much cause for laughter to his companions, no less than to\r\nNiccolosa and Filippo.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Ninth]\r\n\r\n     TWO YOUNG GENTLEMEN LODGE THE NIGHT WITH AN INNKEEPER,\r\n     WHEREOF ONE GOETH TO LIE WITH THE HOST'S DAUGHTER, WHILST\r\n     HIS WIFE UNWITTINGLY COUCHETH WITH THE OTHER; AFTER WHICH HE\r\n     WHO LAY WITH THE GIRL GETTETH HIM TO BED WITH HER FATHER AND\r\n     TELLETH HIM ALL, THINKING TO BESPEAK HIS COMRADE.\r\n     THEREWITHAL THEY COME TO WORDS, BUT THE WIFE, PERCEIVING HER\r\n     MISTAKE, ENTERETH HER DAUGHTER'S BED AND THENCE WITH CERTAIN\r\n     WORDS APPEASETH EVERYTHING\r\n\r\n\r\nCalandrino, who had otherwhiles afforded the company matter for\r\nlaughter, made them laugh this time also, and whenas the ladies had\r\nleft devising of his fashions, the queen bade Pamfilo tell, whereupon\r\nquoth he, \"Laudable ladies, the name of Niccolosa, Calandrino's\r\nmistress, hath brought me back to mind a story of another Niccolosa,\r\nwhich it pleaseth me to tell you, for that therein you shall see how a\r\ngoodwife's ready wit did away a great scandal.\r\n\r\nIn the plain of Mugnone there was not long since a good man who gave\r\nwayfarers to eat and drink for their money, and although he was poor\r\nand had but a small house, he bytimes at a pinch gave, not every one,\r\nbut sundry acquaintances, a night's lodging. He had a wife, a very\r\nhandsome woman, by whom he had two children, whereof one was a fine\r\nbuxom lass of some fifteen or sixteen years of age, who was not yet\r\nmarried, and the other a little child, not yet a year old, whom his\r\nmother herself suckled. Now a young gentleman of our city, a sprightly\r\nand pleasant youth, who was often in those parts, had cast his eyes on\r\nthe girl and loved her ardently; and she, who gloried greatly in being\r\nbeloved of a youth of his quality, whilst studying with pleasing\r\nfashions to maintain him in her love, became no less enamoured of him,\r\nand more than once, by mutual accord, this their love had had the\r\ndesired effect, but that Pinuccio (for such was the young man's name)\r\nfeared to bring reproach upon his mistress and himself. However, his\r\nardour waxing from day to day, he could no longer master his desire to\r\nforegather with her and bethought himself to find a means of\r\nharbouring with her father, doubting not, from his acquaintance with\r\nthe ordinance of the latter's house, but he might in that event\r\ncontrive to pass the night in her company, without any being the\r\nwiser; and no sooner had he conceived this design than he proceeded\r\nwithout delay to carry it into execution.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in company with a trusty friend of his called Adriano,\r\nwho knew his love, he late one evening hired a couple of hackneys and\r\nset thereon two pairs of saddle-bags, filled belike with straw, with\r\nwhich they set out from Florence and fetching a compass, rode till\r\nthey came overagainst the plain of Mugnone, it being by this night;\r\nthen, turning about, as they were on their way back from Romagna, they\r\nmade for the good man's house and knocked at the door. The host, being\r\nvery familiar with both of them, promptly opened the door and Pinuccio\r\nsaid to him, 'Look you, thou must needs harbour us this night. We\r\nthought to reach Florence before dark, but have not availed to make\r\nsuch haste but that we find ourselves here, as thou seest at this\r\nhour.' 'Pinuccio,' answered the host, 'thou well knowest how little\r\ncommodity I have to lodge such men as you are; however, since the\r\nnight hath e'en overtaken you here and there is no time for you to go\r\notherwhere, I will gladly harbour you as I may.' The two young men\r\naccordingly alighted and entered the inn, where they first eased[434]\r\ntheir hackneys and after supper with the host, having taken good care\r\nto bring provision with them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 434: _Adagiarono_, _i.e._ unsaddled and stabled and fed\r\nthem.]\r\n\r\nNow the good man had but one very small bedchamber, wherein were three\r\npallet-beds set as best he knew, two at one end of the room and the\r\nthird overagainst them at the other end; nor for all that was there so\r\nmuch space left that one could go there otherwise than straitly. The\r\nleast ill of the three the host let make ready for the two friends and\r\nput them to lie there; then, after a while neither of the gentlemen\r\nbeing asleep, though both made a show thereof, he caused his daughter\r\nbetake herself to bed in one of the two others and lay down himself\r\nin the third, with his wife, who set by the bedside the cradle wherein\r\nshe had her little son. Things being ordered after this fashion and\r\nPinuccio having seen everything, after a while, himseeming that every\r\none was asleep, he arose softly and going to the bed where slept the\r\ngirl beloved of him, laid himself beside the latter, by whom, for all\r\nshe did it timorously, he was joyfully received, and with her he\r\nproceeded to take of that pleasure which both most desired. Whilst\r\nPinuccio abode thus with his mistress, it chanced that a cat caused\r\ncertain things fall, which the good wife, awaking, heard; whereupon,\r\nfearing lest it were otherwhat, she arose, as she was, in the dark and\r\nbetook herself whereas she had heard the noise.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Adriano, without intent aforethought, arose by chance for\r\nsome natural occasion and going to despatch this, came upon the\r\ncradle, whereas it had been set by the good wife, and unable to pass\r\nwithout moving it, took it up and set it down beside his own bed;\r\nthen, having accomplished that for which he had arisen, he returned\r\nand betook himself to bed again, without recking of the cradle. The\r\ngood wife, having searched and found the thing which had fallen was\r\nnot what she thought, never troubled herself to kindle a light, to see\r\nit, but, chiding the cat, returned to the chamber and groped her way\r\nto the bed where her husband lay. Finding the cradle not there, 'Mercy\r\no' me!' quoth she in herself. 'See what I was about to do! As I am a\r\nChristian, I had well nigh gone straight to our guest's bed.' Then,\r\ngoing a little farther and finding the cradle, she entered the bed\r\nwhereby it stood and laid herself down beside Adriano, thinking to\r\ncouch with her husband. Adriano, who was not yet asleep, feeling this,\r\nreceived her well and joyously and laying her aboard in a trice,\r\nclapped on all sail, to the no small contentment of the lady.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Pinuccio, fearing lest sleep should surprise him with his\r\nlass and having taken of her his fill of pleasure, arose from her, to\r\nreturn to his own bed, to sleep, and finding the cradle in his way,\r\ntook the adjoining bed for that of his host; wherefore, going a little\r\nfarther, he lay down with the latter, who awoke at his coming.\r\nPinuccio, deeming himself beside Adriano, said, 'I tell thee there\r\nnever was so sweet a creature as is Niccolosa. Cock's body, I have had\r\nwith her the rarest sport ever man had with woman, more by token that\r\nI have gone upwards of six times into the country, since I left thee.'\r\nThe host, hearing this talk and being not overwell pleased therewith,\r\nsaid first in himself, 'What a devil doth this fellow here?' Then,\r\nmore angered than well-advised, 'Pinuccio,' quoth he, 'this hath been\r\na great piece of villainy of thine, and I know not why thou shouldst\r\nhave used me thus; but, by the body of God, I will pay thee for it!!'\r\nPinuccio, who was not the wisest lad in the world, seeing his mistake,\r\naddressed not himself to mend it as best he might, but said, 'Of what\r\nwilt thou pay me? What canst thou do to me?' Therewithal the hostess,\r\nwho thought herself with her husband, said to Adriano, 'Good lack,\r\nhark to our guests how they are at I know not what words together!'\r\nQuoth Adriano, laughing, 'Leave them do, God land them in an ill\r\nyear! They drank overmuch yesternight.'\r\n\r\nThe good wife, herseeming she had heard her husband scold and hearing\r\nAdriano speak, incontinent perceived where and with whom she had been;\r\nwhereupon, like a wise woman as she was, she arose forthright, without\r\nsaying a word, and taking her little son's cradle, carried it at a\r\nguess, for that there was no jot of light to be seen in the chamber,\r\nto the side of the bed where her daughter slept and lay down with the\r\nlatter; then, as if she had been aroused by her husband's clamour, she\r\ncalled him and enquired what was to do between himself and Pinuccio.\r\nHe answered, 'Hearest thou not what he saith he hath done this night\r\nunto Niccolosa?' 'Marry,' quoth she, 'he lieth in his throat, for he\r\nwas never abed with Niccolosa, seeing that I have lain here all night;\r\nmore by token that I have not been able to sleep a wink; and thou art\r\nan ass to believe him. You men drink so much of an evening that you do\r\nnothing but dream all night and fare hither and thither, without\r\nknowing it, and fancy you do wonders. 'Tis a thousand pities you don't\r\nbreak your necks. But what doth Pinuccio yonder? Why bideth he not in\r\nhis own bed?' Adriano, on his part, seeing how adroitly the good wife\r\nwent about to cover her own shame and that of her daughter, chimed in\r\nwith, 'Pinuccio, I have told thee an hundred times not to go abroad,\r\nfor that this thy trick of arising in thy sleep and telling for true\r\nthe extravagances thou dreamest will bring thee into trouble some day\r\nor other. Come back here, God give thee an ill night!'\r\n\r\nThe host, hearing what his wife and Adriano said, began to believe in\r\ngood earnest that Pinuccio was dreaming; and accordingly, taking him\r\nby the shoulders, he fell to shaking and calling him, saying,\r\n'Pinuccio, awake; return to thine own bed.' Pinuccio having\r\napprehended all that had been said began to wander off into other\r\nextravagances, after the fashion of a man a-dream; whereat the host\r\nset up the heartiest laughter in the world. At last, he made believe\r\nto awake for stress of shaking, and calling to Adriano, said, 'Is it\r\nalready day, that thou callest me?' 'Ay,' answered the other, 'come\r\nhither.' Accordingly, Pinuccio, dissembling and making a show of being\r\nsleepy-eyed, arose at last from beside the host and went back to bed\r\nwith Adriano. The day come and they being risen, the host fell to\r\nlaughing and mocking at Pinuccio and his dreams; and so they passed\r\nfrom one jest to another, till the young men, having saddled their\r\nrounceys and strapped on their valises and drunken with the host,\r\nremounted to horse and rode away to Florence, no less content with the\r\nmanner in which the thing had betided than with the effect itself\r\nthereof. Thereafter Pinuccio found other means of foregathering with\r\nNiccolosa, who vowed to her mother that he had certainly dreamt the\r\nthing; wherefore the goodwife, remembering her of Adriano's\r\nembracements, inwardly avouched herself alone to have waked.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Ninth]\r\n\r\n     TALANO DI MOLESE DREAMETH THAT A WOLF MANGLETH ALL HIS\r\n     WIFE'S NECK AND FACE AND BIDDETH HER BEWARE THEREOF; BUT SHE\r\n     PAYETH NO HEED TO HIS WARNING AND IT BEFALLETH HER EVEN AS\r\n     HE HAD DREAMED\r\n\r\n\r\nPamfilo's story being ended and the goodwife's presence of mind having\r\nbeen commended of all, the queen bade Pampinea tell hers and she\r\nthereupon began, \"It hath been otherwhile discoursed among us,\r\ncharming ladies, of the truths foreshown by dreams, the which many of\r\nour sex scoff at; wherefore, notwithstanding that which hath been said\r\nthereof, I shall not scruple to tell you, in a very few words, that\r\nwhich no great while ago befell a she-neighbour of mine for not giving\r\ncredit to a dream of herself seen by her husband.\r\n\r\nI know not if you were acquainted with Talano di Molese, a very\r\nworshipful man, who took to wife a young lady called Margarita, fair\r\nover all others, but so humoursome, ill-conditioned and froward that\r\nshe would do nought of other folk's judgment, nor could others do\r\naught to her liking; the which, irksome as it was to Talano to endure,\r\nnatheless, as he could no otherwise, needs must he put up with. It\r\nchanced one night that, being with this Margarita of his at an estate\r\nhe had in the country, himseemed in his sleep he saw his wife go\r\nwalking in a very fair wood which they had not far from their house,\r\nand as she went, himseemed there came forth of a thicket a great and\r\nfierce wolf, which sprang straight at her throat and pulling her to\r\nthe ground, enforced himself to carry her off, whilst she screamed for\r\naid; and after, she winning free of his fangs, it seemed he had marred\r\nall her throat and face. Accordingly, when he arose in the morning, he\r\nsaid to the lady, 'Wife, albeit thy frowardness hath never suffered me\r\nto have a good day with thee, yet it would grieve me should ill betide\r\nthee; wherefore, an thou wilt hearken to my counsel, thou wilt not go\r\nforth the house to-day'; and being asked of her why, he orderly\r\nrecounted to her his dream.\r\n\r\nThe lady shook her head and said, 'Who willeth thee ill, dreameth thee\r\nill. Thou feignest thyself mighty careful of me; but thou dreamest of\r\nme that which thou wouldst fain see come to pass; and thou mayst be\r\nassured that I will be careful both to-day and always not to gladden\r\nthee with this or other mischance of mine.' Quoth Talano, 'I knew thou\r\nwouldst say thus; for that such thanks still hath he who combeth a\r\nscald-head; but, believe as thou listeth, I for my part tell it to\r\nthee for good, and once more I counsel thee abide at home to-day or at\r\nleast beware of going into our wood.' 'Good,' answered the lady, 'I\r\nwill do it'; and after fell a-saying to herself, 'Sawest thou how\r\nartfully yonder man thinketh to have feared me from going to our wood\r\nto-day? Doubtless he hath given some trull or other tryst there and\r\nwould not have me find him with her. Marry, it were fine eating for\r\nhim with blind folk and I should be a right simpleton an I saw not his\r\ndrift and if I believed him! But certes he shall not have his will;\r\nnay, though I abide there all day, needs must I see what traffic is\r\nthis that he hath in hand to-day.'\r\n\r\nAccordingly, her husband being gone out at one door, she went out at\r\nthe other and betook herself as most secretly she might straight to\r\nthe wood and hid herself in the thickest part thereof, standing attent\r\nand looking now here and now there, an she should see any one come. As\r\nshe abode on this wise, without any thought of danger, behold, there\r\nsallied forth of a thick coppice hard by a terrible great wolf, and\r\nscarce could she say, 'Lord, aid me!' when it flew at her throat and\r\nlaying fast hold of her, proceeded to carry her off, as she were a\r\nlambkin. She could neither cry nor aid herself on other wise, so sore\r\nwas her gullet straitened; wherefore the wolf, carrying her off, would\r\nassuredly have throttled her, had he not encountered certain\r\nshepherds, who shouted at him and constrained him to loose her. The\r\nshepherds knew her and carried her home, in a piteous plight, where,\r\nafter long tending by the physicians, she was healed, yet not so\r\nwholly but she had all her throat and a part of her face marred on\r\nsuch wise that, whereas before she was fair, she ever after appeared\r\nmisfeatured and very foul of favour; wherefore, being ashamed to\r\nappear whereas she might be seen, she many a time bitterly repented\r\nher of her frowardness and her perverse denial to put faith, in a\r\nmatter which cost her nothing, in her husband's true dream.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Ninth]\r\n\r\n     BIONDELLO CHEATETH CIACCO OF A DINNER, WHEREOF THE OTHER\r\n     CRAFTILY AVENGETH HIMSELF, PROCURING HIM TO BE SHAMEFULLY\r\n     BEATEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe merry company with one accord avouched that which Talano had seen\r\nin sleep to have been no dream, but a vision, so punctually, without\r\nthere failing aught thereof, had it come to pass. But, all being\r\nsilent the queen charged Lauretta follow on, who said, \"Like as those,\r\nmost discreet ladies, who have to-day foregone me in speech, have been\r\nwell nigh all moved to discourse by something already said, even so\r\nthe stern vengeance wreaked by the scholar, of whom Pampinea told us\r\nyesterday, moveth me to tell of a piece of revenge, which, without\r\nbeing so barbarous as the former, was nevertheless grievous unto him\r\nwho brooked it.\r\n\r\nI must tell you, then, that there was once in Florence a man whom all\r\ncalled Ciacco,[435] as great a glutton as ever lived. His means\r\nsufficing him not to support the expense that his gluttony required\r\nand he being, for the rest, a very well-mannered man and full of\r\ngoodly and pleasant sayings, he addressed himself to be, not\r\naltogether a buffoon, but a spunger[436] and to company with those\r\nwho were rich and delighted to eat of good things; and with these he\r\nwent often to dine and sup, albeit he was not always bidden. There was\r\nlikewise at Florence, in those days, a man called Biondello, a little\r\ndapper fellow of his person, very quaint of his dress and sprucer than\r\na fly, with his coif on his head and his yellow periwig still drest to\r\na nicety, without a hair awry, who plied the same trade as Ciacco.\r\nGoing one morning in Lent whereas they sell the fish and cheapening\r\ntwo very fine lampreys for Messer Vieri de' Cerchj, he was seen by\r\nCiacco, who accosted him and said, 'What meaneth this?' Whereto\r\nBiondello made answer, 'Yestereve there were sent unto Messer Corso\r\nDonati three lampreys, much finer than these, and a sturgeon; to which\r\nsufficing him not for a dinner he is minded to give certain gentlemen,\r\nhe would have me buy these other two. Wilt thou not come thither,\r\nthou?' Quoth Ciacco, 'Thou knowest well that I shall be there.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 435: _i.e._ hog.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 436: Lit. a backbiter (_morditore_).]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, whenas it seemed to him time, he betook himself to Messer\r\nCorso's house, where he found him with sundry neighbours of his, not\r\nyet gone to dinner, and being asked of him what he went doing,\r\nanswered, 'Sir, I am come to dine with you and your company.' Quoth\r\nMesser Corso, 'Thou art welcome; and as it is time, let us to table.'\r\nThereupon they seated themselves at table and had, to begin with,\r\nchickpease and pickled tunny, and after a dish of fried fish from the\r\nArno, and no more, Ciacco, perceiving the cheat that Biondello had put\r\nupon him, was inwardly no little angered thereat and resolved to pay\r\nhim for it; nor had many days passed ere he again encountered the\r\nother, who had by this time made many folk merry with the trick he had\r\nplayed him. Biondello, seeing him, saluted him and asked him,\r\nlaughing, how he had found Messer Corso's lampreys; to which Ciacco\r\nanswered, 'That shalt thou know much better than I, ere eight days be\r\npast.'\r\n\r\nThen, without wasting time over the matter, he took leave of Biondello\r\nand agreeing for a price with a shrewd huckster, carried him near to\r\nthe Cavicciuoli Gallery and showing him a gentleman there, called\r\nMesser Filippo Argenti, a big burly rawboned fellow and the most\r\ndespiteful, choleric and humoursome man alive, gave him a great glass\r\nflagon and said to him, 'Go to yonder gentleman with this flask in\r\nhand and say to him, \"Sir Biondello sendeth me to you and prayeth you\r\nbe pleased to rubify him this flask with your good red wine, for that\r\nhe would fain make merry somedele with his minions.\" But take good\r\ncare he lay not his hands on thee; else will he give thee an ill\r\nmorrow and thou wilt have marred my plans.' 'Have I aught else to\r\nsay,' asked the huckster; and Ciacco answered, 'No; do but go and say\r\nthis and after come back to me here with the flask and I will pay\r\nthee.' The huckster accordingly set off and did his errand to Messer\r\nFilippo, who, hearing the message and being lightly ruffled, concluded\r\nthat Biondello, whom he knew, had a mind to make mock of him, and\r\nwaxing all red in the face, said, 'What \"rubify me\" and what \"minions\"\r\nbe these? God land thee and him an ill year!' Then, starting to his\r\nfeet, he put out his hand to lay hold of the huckster; but the latter,\r\nwho was on his guard, promptly took to his heels and returning by\r\nanother way to Ciacco, who had seen all that had passed, told him what\r\nMesser Filippo had said to him. Ciacco, well pleased, paid him and\r\nrested not till he found Biondello, to whom quoth he, 'Hast thou been\r\nlate at the Cavicciuoli Gallery?' 'Nay,' answered the other. 'Why dost\r\nthou ask me?' 'Because,' replied Ciacco, 'I must tell thee that Messer\r\nFilippo enquireth for thee; I know not what he would have.' 'Good,'\r\nrejoined Biondello; 'I am going that way and will speak with him.'\r\nAccordingly, he made off, and Ciacco followed him, to see how the\r\nthing should pass.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Messer Filippo, having failed to come at the huckster, abode\r\nsore disordered and was inwardly all a-fume with rage, being unable to\r\nmake anything in the world of the huckster's words, if not that\r\nBiondello, at whosesoever instance, was minded to make mock of him. As\r\nhe fretted himself thus, up came Biondello, whom no sooner did he espy\r\nthan he made for him and dealt him a sore buffet in the face. 'Alack,\r\nsir,' cried Biondello, 'what is this?' Whereupon Messer Filippo,\r\nclutching him by the hair and tearing his coif, cast his bonnet to the\r\nground and said, laying on to him amain the while, 'Knave that thou\r\nart, thou shalt soon see what it is! What is this thou sendest to say\r\nto me with thy \"rubify me\" and thy \"minions\"? Deemest thou me a child,\r\nto be flouted on this wise?' So saying, he battered his whole face\r\nwith his fists, which were like very iron, nor left him a hair on his\r\nhead unruffled; then, rolling him in the mire, he tore all the clothes\r\noff his back; and to this he applied himself with such a will that\r\nBiondello could not avail to say a word to him nor ask why he served\r\nhim thus. He had heard him indeed speak of 'rubify me' and 'minions,'\r\nbut knew not what this meant.\r\n\r\nAt last, Messer Filippo having beaten him soundly, the bystanders,\r\nwhereof many had by this time gathered about them, dragged him, with\r\nthe utmost difficulty, out of the other's clutches, all bruised and\r\nbattered as he was, and told him why the gentleman had done this,\r\nblaming him for that which he had sent to say to him and telling him\r\nthat he should by that time have known Messer Filippo better and that\r\nhe was not a man to jest withal. Biondello, all in tears protested his\r\ninnocence, declaring that he had never sent to Messer Filippo for\r\nwine, and as soon as he was somewhat recovered, he returned home, sick\r\nand sorry, divining that this must have been Ciacco's doing. When,\r\nafter many days, the bruises being gone, he began to go abroad again,\r\nit chanced that Ciacco encountered him and asked him, laughing,\r\n'Harkye, Biondello, how deemest thou of Messer Filippo's wine?' 'Even\r\nas thou of Messer Corso's lampreys,' replied the other; and Ciacco\r\nsaid, 'The thing resteth with thee henceforth. Whenever thou goest\r\nabout to give me to eat as thou didst, I will give thee in return to\r\ndrink after t'other day's fashion.' Biondello, knowing full well that\r\nit was easier to wish Ciacco ill than to put it in practise, besought\r\nGod of his peace[437] and thenceforth was careful to affront him no\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 437: _i.e._ conjured him by God to make peace with him.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NINTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Ninth]\r\n\r\n     TWO YOUNG MEN SEEK COUNSEL OF SOLOMON, ONE HOW HE MAY BE\r\n     LOVED AND THE OTHER HOW HE MAY AMEND HIS FROWARD WIFE, AND\r\n     IN ANSWER HE BIDDETH THE ONE LOVE AND THE OTHER GET HIM TO\r\n     GOOSEBRIDGE\r\n\r\n\r\nNone other than the queen remaining to tell, so she would maintain\r\nDioneo his privilege, she, after the ladies had laughed at the unlucky\r\nBiondello, began blithely to speak thus: \"Lovesome ladies, if the\r\nordinance of created things be considered with a whole mind, it will\r\nlightly enough be seen that the general multitude of women are by\r\nnature, by custom and by law subjected unto men and that it behoveth\r\nthem order and govern themselves according to the discretion of these\r\nlatter; wherefore each woman, who would have quiet and ease and solace\r\nwith those men to whom she pertaineth, should be humble, patient and\r\nobedient, besides being virtuous, which latter is the supreme and\r\nespecial treasure of every wise woman. Nay, though the laws, which in\r\nall things regard the general weal, and usance or (let us say) custom,\r\nwhose puissance is both great and worship-worth, taught us not this,\r\nnature very manifestly showeth it unto us, inasmuch as she hath made\r\nus women tender and delicate of body and timid and fearful of spirit\r\nand hath given us little bodily strength, sweet voices and soft and\r\ngraceful movements, all things testifying that we have need of the\r\ngovernance of others. Now, those who have need to be helped and\r\ngoverned, all reason requireth that they be obedient and submissive\r\nand reverent to their governors; and whom have we to governors and\r\nhelpers, if not men? To men, therefore, it behoveth us submit\r\nourselves, honouring them supremely; and whoso departeth from this, I\r\nhold her deserving, not only of grave reprehension, but of severe\r\npunishment. To these considerations I was lead, though not for the\r\nfirst time, by that which Pampinea told us a while ago of Talano's\r\nfroward wife, upon whom God sent that chastisement which her husband\r\nhad not known to give her; wherefore, as I have already said, all\r\nthose women who depart from being loving, compliant and amenable, as\r\nnature, usance and law will it, are, in my judgment, worthy of stern\r\nand severe chastisement. It pleaseth me, therefore, to recount to you\r\na counsel given by Solomon, as a salutary medicine for curing women\r\nwho are thus made of that malady; which counsel let none, who meriteth\r\nnot such treatment, repute to have been said for her, albeit men have\r\na byword which saith, 'Good horse and bad horse both the spur need\r\nstill, And women need the stick, both good and ill.' Which words, an\r\none seek to interpret them by way of pleasantry, all women will\r\nlightly allow to be true; nay, but considering them morally,[438] I\r\nsay that the same must be conceded of them; for that women are all\r\nnaturally unstable and prone [to frailty,] wherefore, to correct the\r\niniquity of those who allow themselves too far to overpass the limits\r\nappointed them, there needeth the stick which punisheth them, and to\r\nsupport the virtue of others who suffer not themselves to transgress,\r\nthere needeth the stick which sustaineth and affeareth them. But, to\r\nleave be preaching for the nonce and come to that which I have it in\r\nmind to tell.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 438: _i.e._ from a serious or moral point of view.]\r\n\r\nYou must know that, the high renown of Solomon's miraculous wisdom\r\nbeing bruited abroad well nigh throughout the whole world, no less\r\nthan the liberality with which he dispensed it unto whoso would fain\r\nbe certified thereof by experience, there flocked many to him from\r\ndivers parts of the world for counsel in their straitest and most\r\nurgent occasions. Amongst others who thus resorted to him was a young\r\nman, Melisso by name, a gentleman of noble birth and great wealth, who\r\nset out from the city of Lajazzo,[439] whence he was and where he\r\ndwelt; and as he journeyed towards Jerusalem, it chanced that, coming\r\nforth of Antioch, he rode for some distance with a young man called\r\nGiosefo, who held the same course as himself. As the custom is of\r\nwayfarers, he entered into discourse with him and having learned from\r\nhim what and whence he was, he asked him whither he went and upon what\r\noccasion; to which Giosefo replied that he was on his way to Solomon,\r\nto have counsel of him what course he should take with a wife he had,\r\nthe most froward and perverse woman alive, whom neither with prayers\r\nnor with blandishments nor on any other wise could he avail to correct\r\nof her waywardness. Then he in his turn questioned Melisso whence he\r\nwas and whither he went and on what errand, and he answered, 'I am of\r\nLajazzo, and like as thou hast a grievance, even so have I one; I am\r\nyoung and rich and spend my substance in keeping open house and\r\nentertaining my fellow-townsmen, and yet, strange to say, I cannot for\r\nall that find one who wisheth me well; wherefore I go whither thou\r\ngoest, to have counsel how I may win to be beloved.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 439: Apparently Laodicea (_hod._ Eskihissar) in Anatolia,\r\nfrom which a traveller, taking the direct land route, would\r\nnecessarily pass Antioch (_hod._ Antakhia) on his way to Jerusalem.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they joined company and journeyed till they came to\r\nJerusalem, where, by the introduction of one of Solomon's barons, they\r\nwere admitted to the presence of the king, to whom Melisso briefly set\r\nforth his occasion. Solomon answered him, 'Love'; and this said,\r\nMelisso was straightway put forth and Giosefo told that for which he\r\nwas there. Solomon made him no other answer than 'Get thee to\r\nGoosebridge'; which said, Giosefo was on like wise removed, without\r\ndelay, from the king's presence and finding Melisso awaiting him\r\nwithout, told him that which he had had for answer. Thereupon,\r\npondering Solomon's words and availing to apprehend therefrom neither\r\nsignificance nor profit whatsoever for their occasions, they set out\r\nto return home, as deeming themselves flouted. After journeying for\r\nsome days, they came to a river, over which was a fine bridge, and a\r\ncaravan of pack-mules and sumpter-horses being in act to pass, it\r\nbehoved them tarry till such time as these should be crossed over.\r\nPresently, the beasts having well nigh all crossed, it chanced that\r\none of the mules took umbrage, as oftentimes we see them do, and\r\nwould by no means pass on; whereupon a muleteer, taking a stick, began\r\nto beat it at first moderately enough to make it go on; but the mule\r\nshied now to this and now to that side of the road and whiles turned\r\nback altogether, but would on no wise pass on; whereupon the man,\r\nincensed beyond measure, fell to dealing it with the stick the\r\nheaviest blows in the world, now on the head, now on the flanks and\r\nanon on the crupper, but all to no purpose.\r\n\r\nMelisso and Giosefo stood watching this and said often to the\r\nmuleteer, 'Alack, wretch that thou art, what dost thou? Wilt thou kill\r\nthe beast? Why studiest thou not to manage him by fair means and\r\ngentle dealing? He will come quicklier than for cudgeling him as thou\r\ndost.' To which the man answered, 'You know your horses and I know my\r\nmule; leave me do with him.' So saying, he fell again to cudgelling\r\nhim and belaboured him to such purpose on one side and on the other,\r\nthat the mule passed on and the muleteer won the bout. Then, the two\r\nyoung men being now about to depart, Giosefo asked a poor man, who sat\r\nat the bridge-head, how the place was called, and he answered, 'Sir,\r\nthis is called Goosebridge.' When Giosefo heard this, he straightway\r\ncalled to mind Solomon's words and said to Melisso, 'Marry, I tell\r\nthee, comrade, that the counsel given me by Solomon may well prove\r\ngood and true, for I perceive very plainly that I knew not how to beat\r\nmy wife; but this muleteer hath shown me what I have to do.'\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they fared on and came, after some days, to Antioch,\r\nwhere Giosefo kept Melisso with him, that he might rest himself a day\r\nor two, and being scurvily enough received of his wife, he bade her\r\nprepare supper according as Melisso should ordain; whereof the latter,\r\nseeing that it was his friend's pleasure, acquitted himself in a few\r\nwords. The lady, as her usance had been in the past, did not as\r\nMelisso had ordained, but well nigh altogether the contrary; which\r\nGiosefo seeing, he was vexed and said, 'Was it not told thee on what\r\nwise thou shouldst prepare the supper?' The lady, turning round\r\nhaughtily, answered, 'What meaneth this? Good lack, why dost thou not\r\nsup, an thou have a mind to sup? An if it were told me otherwise, it\r\nseemed good to me to do thus. If it please thee, so be it; if not,\r\nleave it be.' Melisso marvelled at the lady's answer and blamed her\r\nexceedingly; whilst Giosefo, hearing this, said, 'Wife, thou art still\r\nwhat thou wast wont to be; but, trust me, I will make thee change thy\r\nfashion.' Then turning to Melisso, 'Friend,' said he, 'we shall soon\r\nsee what manner of counsel was Solomon's; but I prithee let it not irk\r\nthee to stand to see it and hold that which I shall do for a sport.\r\nAnd that thou mayest not hinder me, bethink thee of the answer the\r\nmuleteer made us, when we pitied his mule.' Quoth Melisso, 'I am in\r\nthy house, where I purpose not to depart from thy good pleasure.'\r\n\r\nGiosefo then took a round stick, made of a young oak, and repaired a\r\nchamber, whither the lady, having arisen from table for despite, had\r\nbetaken herself, grumbling; then, laying hold of her by the hair, he\r\nthrew her down at his feet and proceeded to give her a sore beating\r\nwith the stick. The lady at first cried out and after fell to\r\nthreats; but, seeing that Giosefo for all that stinted not and being\r\nby this time all bruised, she began to cry him mercy for God's sake\r\nand besought him not to kill her, declaring that she would never more\r\ndepart from his pleasure. Nevertheless, he held not his hand; nay, he\r\ncontinued to baste her more furiously than ever on all her seams,\r\nbelabouring her amain now on the ribs, now on the haunches and now\r\nabout the shoulder, nor stinted till he was weary and there was not a\r\nplace left unbruised on the good lady's back. This done, he returned\r\nto his friend and said to him, 'To-morrow we shall see what will be\r\nthe issue of the counsel to go to Goosebridge.' Then, after he had\r\nrested awhile and they had washed their hands, he supped with Melisso\r\nand in due season they betook themselves to bed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the wretched lady arose with great pain from the ground and\r\ncasting herself on the bed, there rested as best she might until the\r\nmorning, when she arose betimes and let ask Giosefo what he would have\r\ndressed for dinner. The latter, making merry over this with Melisso,\r\nappointed it in due course, and after, whenas it was time, returning,\r\nthey found everything excellently well done and in accordance with the\r\nordinance given; wherefore they mightily commended the counsel at\r\nfirst so ill apprehended of them. After some days, Melisso took leave\r\nof Giosefo and returning to his own house, told one, who was a man of\r\nunderstanding, the answer he had had from Solomon; whereupon quoth the\r\nother, 'He could have given thee no truer nor better counsel. Thou\r\nknowest thou lovest no one, and the honours and services thou\r\nrenderest others, thou dost not for love that thou bearest them, but\r\nfor pomp and ostentation. Love, then, as Solomon bade thee, and thou\r\nshalt be loved.' On this wise, then, was the froward wife corrected\r\nand the young man, loving, was beloved.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TENTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Ninth]\r\n\r\n     DOM GIANNI, AT THE INSTANCE OF HIS GOSSIP PIETRO, PERFORMETH\r\n     A CONJURATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF CAUSING THE LATTER'S WIFE\r\n     TO BECOME A MARE; BUT, WHENAS HE COMETH TO PUT ON THE TAIL,\r\n     PIETRO MARRETH THE WHOLE CONJURATION, SAYING THAT HE WILL\r\n     NOT HAVE A TAIL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe queen's story made the young men laugh and gave rise to some\r\nmurmurs on the part of the ladies; then, as soon as the latter were\r\nquiet, Dioneo began to speak thus, \"Sprightly ladies, a black crow\r\namongst a multitude of white doves addeth more beauty than would a\r\nsnow-white swan, and in like manner among many sages one less wise is\r\nnot only an augmentation of splendour and goodliness to their\r\nmaturity, but eke a source of diversion and solace. Wherefore, you\r\nladies being all exceeding discreet and modest, I, who savour somewhat\r\nof the scatterbrain, should be dearer to you, causing, as I do, your\r\nworth to shine the brightlier for my default, than if with my greater\r\nmerit I made this of yours wax dimmer; and consequently, I should have\r\nlarger license to show you myself such as I am and should more\r\npatiently be suffered of you, in saying that which I shall say, than\r\nif I were wiser. I will, therefore, tell you a story not overlong,\r\nwhereby you may apprehend how diligently it behoveth to observe the\r\nconditions imposed by those who do aught by means of enchantment and\r\nhow slight a default thereof sufficeth to mar everything done by the\r\nmagician.\r\n\r\nA year or two agone there was at Barletta a priest called Dom Gianni\r\ndi Barolo, who, for that he had but a poor cure, took to eking out his\r\nlivelihood by hawking merchandise hither and thither about the fairs\r\nof Apulia with a mare of his and buying and selling. In the course of\r\nhis travels he contracted a strait friendship with one who styled\r\nhimself Pietro da Tresanti and plied the same trade with the aid of an\r\nass he had. In token of friendship and affection, he called him still\r\nGossip Pietro, after the Apulian fashion, and whenassoever he visited\r\nBarletta, he carried him to his parsonage and there lodged him with\r\nhimself and entertained him to the best of his power. Gossip Pietro,\r\non his part, albeit he was very poor and had but a sorry little house\r\nat Tresanti, scarce sufficing for himself and a young and buxom wife\r\nhe had and his ass, as often as Dom Gianni came to Tresanti, carried\r\nhim home with him and entertained him as best he might, in requital of\r\nthe hospitality received from him at Barletta. Nevertheless, in the\r\nmatter of lodging, having but one sorry little bed, in which he slept\r\nwith his handsome wife, he could not entertain him as he would, but,\r\nDom Gianni's mare being lodged with Pietro's ass in a little stable he\r\nhad, needs must the priest himself lie by her side on a truss of\r\nstraw.\r\n\r\nThe goodwife, knowing the hospitality which the latter did her husband\r\nat Barletta, would more than once, whenas the priest came thither,\r\nhave gone to lie with a neighbor of hers, by name Zita Caraprese,\r\n[daughter] of Giudice Leo, so he might sleep in the bed with her\r\nhusband, and had many a time proposed it to Dom Gianni, but he would\r\nnever hear of it; and once, amongst other times, he said to her,\r\n'Gossip Gemmata, fret not thyself for me; I fare very well, for that,\r\nwhenas it pleaseth me, I cause this mare of mine become a handsome\r\nwench and couch with her, and after, when I will, I change her into a\r\nmare again; wherefore I care not to part from her.'\r\n\r\nThe young woman marvelled, but believed his tale and told her husband,\r\nsaying, 'If he is so much thy friend as thou sayest, why dost thou not\r\nmake him teach thee his charm, so thou mayst avail to make of me a\r\nmare and do thine affairs with the ass and the mare? So should we gain\r\ntwo for one; and when we were back at home, thou couldst make me a\r\nwoman again, as I am.' Pietro, who was somewhat dull of wit, believed\r\nwhat she said and falling in with her counsel, began, as best he knew,\r\nto importune Dom Gianni to teach him the trick. The latter did his\r\nbest to cure him of that folly, but availing not thereto, he said,\r\n'Harkye, since you will e'en have it so, we will arise to-morrow\r\nmorning before day, as of our wont, and I will show you how it is\r\ndone. To tell thee the truth, the uneathest part of the matter is the\r\nputting on of the tail, as thou shalt see.'\r\n\r\nAccordingly, whenas it drew near unto day, Goodman Pietro and Gossip\r\nGemmata, who had scarce slept that night, with such impatience did\r\nthey await the accomplishment of the matter, arose and called Dom\r\nGianni, who, arising in his shirt, betook himself to Pietro's little\r\nchamber and said to him, 'I know none in the world, except you, for\r\nwhom I would do this; wherefore since it pleaseth you, I will e'en do\r\nit; but needs must you do as I shall bid you, an you would have the\r\nthing succeed.' They answered that they would do that which he should\r\nsay; whereupon, taking the light, he put it into Pietro's hand and\r\nsaid to him, 'Mark how I shall do and keep well in mind that which I\r\nshall say. Above all, have a care, an thou wouldst not mar everything,\r\nthat, whatsoever thou hearest or seest, thou say not a single word,\r\nand pray God that the tail may stick fast.' Pietro took the light,\r\npromising to do exactly as he said, whereupon Dom Gianni let strip\r\nGemmata naked as she was born and caused her stand on all fours,\r\nmare-fashion, enjoining herself likewise not to utter a word for aught\r\nthat should betide. Then, passing his hand over her face and her head,\r\nhe proceeded to say, 'Be this a fine mare's head,' and touching her\r\nhair, said, 'Be this a fine mare's mane'; after which he touched her\r\narms, saying, 'Be these fine mare's legs and feet,' and coming\r\npresently to her breast and finding it round and firm, such an one\r\nawoke that was not called and started up on end,[440] whereupon quoth\r\nhe, 'Be this a fine mare's chest.' And on like wise he did with her\r\nback and belly and crupper and thighs and legs. Ultimately, nothing\r\nremaining to do but the tail, he pulled up his shirt and taking the\r\ndibble with which he planted men, he thrust it hastily into the furrow\r\nmade therefor and said, 'And be this a fine mare's tail.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 440: _i.e._ arrectus est penis ejus.]\r\n\r\nPietro, who had thitherto watched everything intently, seeing this\r\nlast proceeding and himseeming it was ill done, said, 'Ho there, Dom\r\nGianni, I won't have a tail there, I won't have a tail there!' The\r\nradical moisture, wherewith all plants are made fast, was by this\r\ncome, and Dom Gianni drew it forth, saying, 'Alack, gossip Pietro,\r\nwhat hast thou done? Did I not bid thee say not a word for aught that\r\nthou shouldst see? The mare was all made; but thou hast marred\r\neverything by talking, nor is there any means of doing it over again\r\nhenceforth.' Quoth Pietro, 'Marry, I did not want that tail there. Why\r\ndid you not say to me, \"Make it thou\"? More by token that you were for\r\nsetting it too low.' 'Because,' answered Dom Gianni, 'thou hadst not\r\nknown for the first time to set it on so well as I.' The young woman,\r\nhearing all this, stood up and said to her husband, in all good faith,\r\n'Dolt that thou art, why hast thou marred thine affairs and mine? What\r\nmare sawest thou ever without a tail? So God aid me, thou art poor,\r\nbut it would serve thee right, wert thou much poorer.' Then, there\r\nbeing now, by reason of the words that Pietro had spoken, no longer\r\nany means of making a mare of the young woman, she donned her clothes,\r\nwoebegone and disconsolate, and Pietro, continuing to ply his old\r\ntrade with an ass, as he was used, betook himself, in company with Dom\r\nGianni, to the Bitonto fair, nor ever again required him of such a\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow much the company laughed at this story, which was better\r\nunderstood of the ladies than Dioneo willed, let her who shall yet\r\nlaugh thereat imagine for herself. But, the day's stories being now\r\nended and the sun beginning to abate of its heat, the queen, knowing\r\nthe end of her seignory to be come, rose to her feet and putting off\r\nthe crown, set it on the head of Pamfilo, whom alone it remained to\r\nhonour after such a fashion, and said, smiling, \"My lord, there\r\ndevolveth on thee a great burden, inasmuch as with thee it resteth,\r\nthou being the last, to make amends for my default and that of those\r\nwho have foregone me in the dignity which thou presently holdest;\r\nwhereof God lend thee grace, even as He hath vouchsafed it unto me to\r\nmake thee king.\" Pamfilo blithely received the honour done him and\r\nanswered, \"Your merit and that of my other subjects will do on such\r\nwise that I shall be adjudged deserving of commendation, even as the\r\nothers have been.\" Then, having, according to the usance of his\r\npredecessors, taken order with the seneschal of the things that were\r\nneedful, he turned to the expectant ladies and said to them, \"Lovesome\r\nladies, it was the pleasure of Emilia, who hath this day been our\r\nqueen, to give you, for the purpose of affording some rest to your\r\npowers, license to discourse of that which should most please you;\r\nwherefore, you being now rested, I hold it well to return to the\r\nwonted ordinance, and accordingly I will that each of you bethink\r\nherself to discourse to-morrow of this, to wit, OF WHOSO HATH ANYWISE\r\nWROUGHT GENEROUSLY OR MAGNIFICENTLY IN MATTERS OF LOVE OR OTHERWHAT.\r\nThe telling and doing of these things will doubtless fire your\r\nwell-disposed minds to do worthily; so will our life, which may not be\r\nother than brief in this mortal body, be made perpetual in laudatory\r\nrenown; a thing which all, who serve not the belly only, as do the\r\nbeasts, should not only desire, but with all diligence seek and\r\nendeavour after.\"\r\n\r\nThe theme pleased the joyous company, who having all, with the new\r\nking's license, arisen from session, gave themselves to their wonted\r\ndiversions, according to that unto which each was most drawn by\r\ndesire; and on this wise they did until the hour of supper, whereunto\r\nthey came joyously and were served with diligence and fair ordinance.\r\nSupper at an end, they arose to the wonted dances, and after they had\r\nsung a thousand canzonets, more diverting of words than masterly of\r\nmusic, the king bade Neifile sing one in her own name; whereupon, with\r\nclear and blithesome voice, she cheerfully and without delay began\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n       A youngling maid am I and full of glee,\r\n         Am fain to carol in the new-blown May,\r\n       Love and sweet thoughts-a-mercy, blithe and free.\r\n\r\n       I go about the meads, considering\r\n           The vermeil flowers and golden and the white,\r\n           Roses thorn-set and lilies snowy-bright,\r\n         And one and all I fare a-likening\r\n         Unto his face who hath with love-liking\r\n       Ta'en and will hold me ever, having aye\r\n     None other wish than as his pleasures be;\r\n\r\n       Whereof when one I find me that doth show,\r\n           Unto my seeming, likest him, full fain\r\n           I cull and kiss and talk with it amain\r\n         And all my heart to it, as best I know,\r\n         Discover, with its store of wish and woe,\r\n       Then it with others in a wreath I lay,\r\n     Bound with my hair so golden-bright of blee.\r\n\r\n       Ay, and that pleasure which the eye doth prove,\r\n           By nature, of the flower's view, like delight\r\n           Doth give me as I saw the very wight\r\n         Who hath inflamed me of his dulcet love,\r\n         And what its scent thereover and above\r\n       Worketh in me, no words indeed can say;\r\n     But sighs thereof bear witness true for me,\r\n\r\n       The which from out my bosom day nor night\r\n           Ne'er, as with other ladies, fierce and wild,\r\n           Storm up; nay, thence they issue warm and mild\r\n         And straight betake them to my loved one's sight,\r\n         Who, hearing, moveth of himself, delight\r\n       To give me; ay, and when I'm like to say\r\n     \"Ah come, lest I despair,\" still cometh he.\r\n\r\nNeifile's canzonet was much commended both of the king and of the\r\nother ladies; after which, for that a great part of the night was now\r\nspent, the king commanded that all should betake themselves to rest\r\nuntil the day.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE ENDETH THE NINTH DAY\r\nOF THE DECAMERON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Day the Tenth_\r\n\r\n     HERE BEGINNETH THE TENTH AND LAST DAY OF THE DECAMERON\r\n     WHEREIN UNDER THE GOVERNANCE OF PAMFILO IS DISCOURSED OF\r\n     WHOSO HATH ANYWISE WROUGHT GENEROUSLY OR MAGNIFICENTLY IN\r\n     MATTERS OF LOVE OR OTHERWHAT\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain cloudlets in the West were yet vermeil, what time those of the\r\nEast were already at their marges grown lucent like unto very gold,\r\nwhen Pamfilo, arising, let call his comrades and the ladies, who being\r\nall come, he took counsel with them of whither they should go for\r\ntheir diversion and fared forth with slow step, accompanied by\r\nFilomena and Fiammetta, whilst all the others followed after. On this\r\nwise, devising and telling and answering many things of their future\r\nlife together, they went a great while a-pleasuring; then, having made\r\na pretty long circuit and the sun beginning to wax overhot, they\r\nreturned to the palace. There they let rinse the beakers in the clear\r\nfountain and whoso would drank somewhat; after which they went\r\nfrolicking among the pleasant shades of the garden until the\r\neating-hour. Then, having eaten and slept, as of their wont, they\r\nassembled whereas it pleased the king and there he called upon Neifile\r\nfor the first discourse, who blithely began thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Tenth]\r\n\r\n     A KNIGHT IN THE KING'S SERVICE OF SPAIN THINKING HIMSELF ILL\r\n     GUERDONED, THE KING BY VERY CERTAIN PROOF SHOWETH HIM THAT\r\n     THIS IS NOT HIS FAULT, BUT THAT OF HIS OWN PERVERSE FORTUNE,\r\n     AND AFTER LARGESSETH HIM MAGNIFICENTLY\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Needs, honourable ladies, must I repute it a singular favour to\r\nmyself that our king hath preferred me unto such an honour as it is to\r\nbe the first to tell of magnificence, the which, even as the sun is\r\nthe glory and adornment of all the heaven, is the light and lustre of\r\nevery other virtue. I will, therefore, tell you a little story\r\nthereof, quaint and pleasant enough to my thinking, which to recall\r\ncan certes be none other than useful.\r\n\r\nYou must know, then, that, among the other gallant gentlemen who have\r\nfrom time immemorial graced our city, there was one (and maybe the\r\nmost of worth) by name Messer Ruggieri de' Figiovanni, who, being both\r\nrich and high-spirited and seeing that, in view of the way of living\r\nand of the usages of Tuscany, he might, if he tarried there, avail to\r\ndisplay little or nothing of his merit, resolved to seek service\r\nawhile with Alfonso, King of Spain, the renown of whose valiance\r\ntranscended that of every other prince of his time; wherefore he\r\nbetook himself, very honourably furnished with arms and horses and\r\nfollowers, to Alfonso in Spain and was by him graciously received.\r\nAccordingly, he took up his abode there and living splendidly and\r\ndoing marvellous deeds of arms, he very soon made himself known for a\r\nman of worth and valour.\r\n\r\nWhen he had sojourned there a pretty while and had taken particular\r\nnote of the king's fashions, himseemed he bestowed castles and cities\r\nand baronies now upon one and now upon another with little enough\r\ndiscretion, as giving them to those who were unworthy thereof, and for\r\nthat to him, who held himself for that which he was, nothing was\r\ngiven, he conceived that his repute would be much abated by reason\r\nthereof; wherefore he determined to depart and craved leave of the\r\nking. The latter granted him the leave he sought and gave him one of\r\nthe best and finest mules that ever was ridden, the which, for the\r\nlong journey he had to make, was very acceptable to Messer Ruggieri.\r\nMoreover, he charged a discreet servant of his that he should study,\r\nby such means as seemed to him best, to ride with Messer Ruggieri on\r\nsuch wise that he should not appear to have been sent by the king, and\r\nnote everything he should say of him, so as he might avail to repeat\r\nit to him, and that on the ensuing morning he should command him\r\nreturn to the court. Accordingly, the servant, lying in wait for\r\nMesser Ruggieri's departure, accosted him, as he came forth the city,\r\nand very aptly joined company with him, giving him to understand that\r\nhe also was bound for Italy. Messer Ruggieri, then, fared on, riding\r\nthe mule given him by the king and devising of one thing and another\r\nwith the latter's servant, till hard upon tierce, when he said,\r\n'Methinketh it were well done to let our beasts stale.' Accordingly,\r\nthey put them up in a stable and they all staled, except the mule;\r\nthen they rode on again, whilst the squire still took note of the\r\ngentleman's words, and came presently to a river, where, as they\r\nwatered their cattle, the mule staled in the stream; which Messer\r\nRuggieri seeing, 'Marry,' quoth he, 'God confound thee, beast, for\r\nthat thou art made after the same fashion as the prince who gave thee\r\nto me!' The squire noted these words and albeit he took store of many\r\nothers, as he journeyed with him all that day, he heard him say nought\r\nelse but what was to the highest praise of the king.\r\n\r\nNext morning, they being mounted and Ruggieri offering to ride towards\r\nTuscany, the squire imparted to him the king's commandment, whereupon\r\nhe incontinent turned back. When he arrived at court, the king,\r\nlearning what he had said of the mule, let call him to himself and\r\nreceiving him with a cheerful favour, asked him why he had likened him\r\nto his mule, or rather why he had likened the mule to him. 'My lord,'\r\nreplied Ruggieri frankly, 'I likened her to you for that, like as you\r\ngive whereas it behoveth not and give not whereas it behoveth, even so\r\nshe staled not whereas it behoved, but staled whereas it behoved not.'\r\nThen said the king, 'Messer Ruggieri, if I have not given to you, as I\r\nhave given unto many who are of no account in comparison with you, it\r\nhappened not because I knew you not for a most valiant cavalier and\r\nworthy of every great gift; nay, but it is your fortune, which hath\r\nnot suffered me guerdon you according to your deserts, that hath\r\nsinned in this, and not I; and that I may say sooth I will manifestly\r\nprove to you.' 'My lord,' replied Ruggieri, 'I was not chagrined\r\nbecause I have gotten no largesse of you, for that I desire not to be\r\nricher than I am, but because you have on no wise borne witness to my\r\nmerit. Natheless, I hold your excuse for good and honourable and am\r\nready to see that which it shall please you show me, albeit I believe\r\nyou without proof.' The king then carried him into a great hall of\r\nhis, where, as he had ordered it beforehand, were two great locked\r\ncoffers, and said to him, in presence of many, 'Messer Ruggieri, in\r\none of these coffers is my crown, the royal sceptre and the orb,\r\ntogether with many goodly girdles and ouches and rings of mine, and in\r\nfine every precious jewel I have; and the other is full of earth.\r\nTake, then, one and be that which you shall take yours; and you may\r\nthus see whether of the twain hath been ungrateful to your worth,\r\nmyself of your ill fortune.'\r\n\r\nMesser Ruggieri, seeing that it was the king's pleasure, took one of\r\nthe coffers, which, being opened by Alfonso's commandment, was found\r\nto be that which was full of earth; whereupon quoth the king,\r\nlaughing, 'Now can you see, Messer Ruggieri, that this that I tell you\r\nof your fortune is true; but certes your worth meriteth that I should\r\noppose myself to her might. I know you have no mind to turn Spaniard\r\nand therefore I will bestow upon you neither castle nor city in these\r\nparts; but this coffer, of which fortune deprived you, I will in her\r\ndespite shall be yours, so you may carry it off to your own country\r\nand justly glorify yourself of your worth in the sight of your\r\ncountrymen by the witness of my gifts.' Messer Ruggieri accordingly\r\ntook the coffer and having rendered the king those thanks which sorted\r\nwith such a gift, joyfully returned therewith to Tuscany.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Tenth]\r\n\r\n     GHINO DI TACCO TAKETH THE ABBOT OF CLUNY AND HAVING CURED\r\n     HIM OF THE STOMACH-COMPLAINT, LETTETH HIM GO; WHEREUPON THE\r\n     ABBOT, RETURNING TO THE COURT OF ROME, RECONCILETH HIM WITH\r\n     POPE BONIFACE AND MAKETH HIM A PRIOR OF THE HOSPITALLERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe magnificence shown by King Alfonso to the Florentine cavalier\r\nhaving been duly commended, the king, who had been mightily pleased\r\ntherewith, enjoined Elisa to follow on, and she straightway began\r\nthus: \"Dainty dames, it cannot be denied that for a king to be\r\nmunificent and to have shown his munificence to him who had served him\r\nis a great and a praiseworthy thing; but what shall we say if a\r\nchurchman be related to have practised marvellous magnanimity towards\r\none, whom if he had used as an enemy, he had of none been blamed\r\ntherefor? Certes, we can say none otherwise than that the king's\r\nmagnificence was a virtue, whilst that of the churchman was a miracle,\r\ninasmuch as the clergy are all exceeding niggardly, nay, far more so\r\nthan women, and sworn enemies of all manner of liberality; and albeit\r\nall men naturally hunger after vengeance for affronts received, we see\r\nchurchmen, for all they preach patience and especially commend the\r\nremission of offences, pursue it more eagerly than other folk. This,\r\nthen, to wit, how a churchman was magnanimous, you may manifestly\r\nlearn from the following story of mine.\r\n\r\nGhino di Tacco, a man very famous for his cruelty and his robberies,\r\nbeing expelled [Transcriber's Note: missing 'from'] Siena and at feud\r\nwith the Counts of Santa Fiore, raised Radicofani against the Church\r\nof Rome and taking up his sojourn there, caused his swashbucklers\r\ndespoil whosoever passed through the surrounding country. Now,\r\nBoniface the Eighth being pope in Rome, there came to court the Abbot\r\nof Cluny, who is believed to be one of the richest prelates in the\r\nworld, and having there marred his stomach, he was advised by the\r\nphysicians to repair to the baths of Siena and he would without fail\r\nbe cured. Accordingly, having gotten the pope's leave, he set out on\r\nhis way thither in great pomp of gear and baggage and horses and\r\nservitors, unrecking of Ghino's [ill] report. The latter, hearing of\r\nhis coming, spread his nets and hemmed him and all his household and\r\ngear about in a strait place, without letting a single footboy escape.\r\nThis done, he despatched to the abbot one, the most sufficient, of his\r\nmen, well accompanied, who in his name very lovingly prayed him be\r\npleased to light down and sojourn with the aforesaid Ghino in his\r\ncastle. The abbot, hearing this, answered furiously that he would\r\nnowise do it, having nought to do with Ghino, but that he would fare\r\non and would fain see who should forbid his passage. Whereto quoth the\r\nmessenger on humble wise, 'Sir, you are come into parts where, barring\r\nGod His might, there is nothing to fear for us and where\r\nexcommunications and interdicts are all excommunicated; wherefore, may\r\nit please you, you were best comply with Ghino in this.'\r\n\r\nDuring this parley, the whole place had been encompassed about with\r\nmen-at-arms; wherefore the abbot, seeing himself taken with his men,\r\nbetook himself, sore against his will, to the castle, in company with\r\nthe ambassador, and with him all his household and gear, and alighting\r\nthere, was, by Ghino's orders, lodged all alone in a very dark and\r\nmean little chamber in one of the pavilions, whilst every one else was\r\nwell enough accommodated, according to his quality, about the castle\r\nand the horses and all the gear put in safety, without aught thereof\r\nbeing touched. This done, Ghino betook himself to the abbot and said\r\nto him, 'Sir, Ghino, whose guest you are, sendeth to you, praying you\r\nacquaint him whither you are bound and on what occasion.' The abbot,\r\nlike a wise man, had by this laid by his pride and told him whither he\r\nwent and why. Ghino, hearing this, took his leave and bethought\r\nhimself to go about to cure him without baths. Accordingly, he let\r\nkeep a great fire still burning in the little room and causing guard\r\nthe place well, returned not to the abbot till the following morning,\r\nwhen he brought him, in a very white napkin, two slices of toasted\r\nbread and a great beaker of his own Corniglia vernage[441] and\r\nbespoke him thus, 'Sir, when Ghino was young, he studied medicine and\r\nsaith that he learned there was no better remedy for the\r\nstomach-complaint than that which he purposeth to apply to you and of\r\nwhich these things that I bring you are the beginning; wherefore do\r\nyou take them and refresh yourself.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 441: See p. 372, note.]\r\n\r\nThe abbot, whose hunger was greater than his desire to bandy words,\r\nate the bread and drank the wine, though he did it with an ill will,\r\nand after made many haughty speeches, asking and counselling of many\r\nthings and demanding in particular to see Ghino. The latter, hearing\r\nthis talk, let part of it pass as idle and answered the rest very\r\ncourteously, avouching that Ghino would visit him as quickliest he\r\nmight. This said, he took his leave of him and returned not until the\r\nensuing day, when he brought him as much toasted bread and as much\r\nmalmsey; and so he kept him several days, till such time as he\r\nperceived that he had eaten some dried beans, which he had of intent\r\naforethought brought secretly thither and left there; whereupon he\r\nasked him, on Ghino's part, how he found himself about the stomach.\r\nThe abbot answered, 'Meseemeth I should fare well, were I but out of\r\nhis hands; and after that, I have no greater desire than to eat, so\r\nwell have his remedies cured me.' Thereupon Ghino caused the abbot's\r\nown people array him a goodly chamber with his own gear and let make\r\nready a magnificent banquet, to which he bade the prelate's whole\r\nhousehold, together with many folk of the burgh. Next morning, he\r\nbetook himself to the abbot and said to him, 'Sir, since you feel\r\nyourself well, it is time to leave the infirmary.' Then, taking him by\r\nthe hand, he brought him to the chamber prepared for him and leaving\r\nhim there in company of his own people, occupied himself with caring\r\nthat the banquet should be a magnificent one.\r\n\r\nThe abbot solaced himself awhile with his men and told them what his\r\nlife had been since his capture, whilst they, on the other hand,\r\navouched themselves all to have been wonder-well entreated of Ghino.\r\nThe eating-hour come, the abbot and the rest were well and orderly\r\nserved with goodly viands and fine wines, without Ghino yet letting\r\nhimself be known of the prelate; but, after the latter had abidden\r\nsome days on this wise, the outlaw, having let bring all his gear into\r\none saloon and all his horses, down to the sorriest rouncey, into a\r\ncourtyard that was under the windows thereof, betook himself to him\r\nand asked him how he did and if he deemed himself strong enough to\r\ntake horse. The abbot answered that he was strong enough and quite\r\nrecovered of his stomach-complaint and that he should fare perfectly\r\nwell, once he should be out of Ghino's hands. Ghino then brought him\r\ninto the saloon, wherein was his gear and all his train, and carrying\r\nhim to a window, whence he might see all his horses, said, 'My lord\r\nabbot, you must know that it was the being a gentleman and expelled\r\nfrom his house and poor and having many and puissant enemies, and not\r\nevilness of mind, that brought Ghino di Tacco (who is none other than\r\nmyself) to be, for the defence of his life and his nobility, a\r\nhighway-robber and an enemy of the court of Rome. Nevertheless, for\r\nthat you seem to me a worthy gentleman, I purpose not, now that I have\r\ncured you of your stomach-complaint, to use you as I would another,\r\nfrom whom, he being in my hands as you are, I would take for myself\r\nsuch part of his goods as seemed well to me; nay, it is my intent that\r\nyou, having regard to my need, shall appoint to me such part of your\r\ngood as you yourself will. It is all here before you in its entirety\r\nand your horses you may from this window see in the courtyard; take,\r\ntherefore, both part and all, as it pleaseth you, and from this time\r\nforth be it at your pleasure to go or to stay.'\r\n\r\nThe abbot marvelled to hear such generous words from a highway-robber\r\nand was exceeding well pleased therewith, insomuch that, his anger and\r\ndespite being of a sudden fallen, nay, changed into goodwill, he\r\nbecame Ghino's hearty friend and ran to embrace him, saying, 'I vow to\r\nGod that, to gain the friendship of a man such as I presently judge\r\nthee to be, I would gladly consent to suffer a far greater affront\r\nthan that which meseemed but now thou hadst done me. Accursed be\r\nfortune that constrained thee to so damnable a trade!' Then, letting\r\ntake of his many goods but a very few necessary things, and the like\r\nof his horses, he left all the rest to Ghino and returned to Rome. The\r\npope had had news of the taking of the abbot and albeit it had given\r\nhim sore concern, he asked him, when he saw him, how the baths had\r\nprofited him; whereto he replied, smiling, 'Holy Father, I found a\r\nworthy physician nearer than at the baths, who hath excellently well\r\ncured me'; and told him how, whereat the pope laughed, and the abbot,\r\nfollowing on his speech and moved by a magnanimous spirit, craved a\r\nboon of him. The pope, thinking he would demand otherwhat, freely\r\noffered to do that which he should ask; and the abbot said, 'Holy\r\nFather, that which I mean to ask of you is that you restore your\r\nfavour to Ghino di Tacco, my physician, for that, of all the men of\r\nworth and high account whom I ever knew, he is certes one of the most\r\ndeserving; and for this ill that he doth, I hold it much more\r\nfortune's fault than his; the which[442] if you change by bestowing on\r\nhim somewhat whereby he may live according to his condition, I doubt\r\nnot anywise but you will, in brief space of time, deem of him even as\r\nI do.' The pope, who was great of soul and a lover of men of worth,\r\nhearing this, replied that he would gladly do it, an Ghino were indeed\r\nof such account as the abbot avouched, and bade the latter cause him\r\ncome thither in all security. Accordingly, Ghino, at the abbot's\r\ninstance, came to court, upon that assurance, nor had he been long\r\nabout the pope's person ere the latter reputed him a man of worth and\r\ntaking him into favour, bestowed on him a grand priory of those of the\r\nHospitallers, having first let make him a knight of that order; which\r\noffice he held whilst he lived, still approving himself a loyal friend\r\nand servant of Holy Church and of the Abbot of Cluny.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 442: _i.e._ fortune.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Tenth]\r\n\r\n     MITHRIDANES, ENVYING NATHAN HIS HOSPITALITY AND GENEROSITY\r\n     AND GOING TO KILL HIM, FALLETH IN WITH HIMSELF, WITHOUT\r\n     KNOWING HIM, AND IS BY HIM INSTRUCTED OF THE COURSE HE SHALL\r\n     TAKE TO ACCOMPLISH HIS PURPOSE; BY MEANS WHEREOF HE FINDETH\r\n     HIM, AS HE HIMSELF HAD ORDERED IT, IN A COPPICE AND\r\n     RECOGNIZING HIM, IS ASHAMED AND BECOMETH HIS FRIEND\r\n\r\n\r\nThemseemed all they had heard what was like unto a miracle, to wit,\r\nthat a churchman should have wrought anywhat magnificently; but, as\r\nsoon as the ladies had left discoursing thereof, the king bade\r\nFilostrato proceed, who forthright began, \"Noble ladies, great was the\r\nmagnificence of the King of Spain and that of the Abbot of Cluny a\r\nthing belike never yet heard of; but maybe it will seem to you no less\r\nmarvellous a thing to hear how a man, that he might do generosity to\r\nanother who thirsted for his blood, nay, for the very breath of his\r\nnostrils, privily bethought himself to give them to him, ay, and would\r\nhave done it, had the other willed to take them, even as I purpose to\r\nshow you in a little story of mine.\r\n\r\nIt is a very certain thing (if credit may be given to the report of\r\ndivers Genoese and others who have been in those countries) that there\r\nwas aforetime in the parts of Cattajo[443] a man of noble lineage and\r\nrich beyond compare, called Nathan, who, having an estate adjoining a\r\nhighway whereby as of necessity passed all who sought to go from the\r\nPonant to the Levant or from the Levant to the Ponant, and being a man\r\nof great and generous soul and desirous that it should be known by his\r\nworks, assembled a great multitude of artificers and let build there,\r\nin a little space of time, one of the fairest and greatest and richest\r\npalaces that had ever been seen, the which he caused excellently well\r\nfurnished with all that was apt unto the reception and entertainment\r\nof gentlemen. Then, having a great and goodly household, he there\r\nreceived and honourably entertained, with joyance and good cheer,\r\nwhosoever came and went; and in this praiseworthy usance he persevered\r\ninsomuch that not only the Levant, but well nigh all the Ponant, knew\r\nhim by report. He was already full of years nor was therefore grown\r\nweary of the practice of hospitality, when it chanced that his fame\r\nreached the ears of a young man of a country not far from his own, by\r\nname Mithridanes, who, knowing himself no less rich than Nathan and\r\nwaxing envious of his renown and his virtues, bethought himself to\r\neclipse or shadow them with greater liberality. Accordingly, letting\r\nbuild a palace like unto that of Nathan, he proceeded to do the most\r\nunbounded courtesies[444] that ever any did whosoever came or went\r\nabout those parts, and in a short time he became without doubt very\r\nfamous.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 443: _Cattajo._ This word is usually translated Cathay,\r\n_i.e._ China; but _semble_ Boccaccio meant rather the Dalmatian\r\nprovince of Cattaro, which would better answer the description in the\r\ntext, Nathan's estate being described as adjoining a highway leading\r\nfrom the Ponant (or Western shores of the Mediterranean) to the Levant\r\n(or Eastern shores), _e.g._ the road from Cattaro on the Adriatic to\r\nSalonica on the Ægean. Cathay (China) seems, from the circumstances of\r\nthe case, out of the question, as is also the Italian town called\r\nCattaio, near Padua.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 444: _i.e._ to show the most extravagant hospitality.]\r\n\r\nIt chanced one day that, as he abode all alone in the midcourt of his\r\npalace, there came in, by one of the gates, a poor woman, who sought\r\nof him an alms and had it; then, coming in again to him by the second,\r\nshe had of him another alms, and so on for twelve times in succession;\r\nbut, whenas she returned for the thirteenth time, he said to her,\r\n'Good woman, thou art very diligent in this thine asking,' and\r\nnatheless gave her an alms. The old crone, hearing these words,\r\nexclaimed, 'O liberality of Nathan, how marvellous art thou! For that,\r\nentering in by each of the two-and-thirty gates which his palace hath,\r\nand asking of him an alms, never, for all that he showed, was I\r\nrecognized of him, and still I had it; whilst here, having as yet come\r\nin but at thirteen gates, I have been both recognized and chidden.' So\r\nsaying, she went her ways and returned thither no more. Mithridanes,\r\nhearing the old woman's words, flamed up into a furious rage, as he\r\nwho held that which he heard of Nathan's fame a diminishment of his\r\nown, and fell to saying, 'Alack, woe is me! When shall I attain to\r\nNathan's liberality in great things, let alone overpass it, as I seek\r\nto do, seeing that I cannot approach him in the smallest? Verily, I\r\nweary myself in vain, an I remove him not from the earth; wherefore,\r\nsince eld carrieth him not off, needs must I with mine own hands do it\r\nwithout delay.'\r\n\r\nAccordingly, rising upon that motion, he took horse with a small\r\ncompany, without communicating his design to any, and came after three\r\ndays whereas Nathan abode. He arrived there at eventide and bidding\r\nhis followers make a show of not being with him and provide themselves\r\nwith lodging, against they should hear farther from him, abode alone\r\nat no great distance from the fair palace, where he found Nathan all\r\nunattended, as he went walking for his diversion, without any pomp of\r\napparel, and knowing him not, asked him if he could inform him where\r\nNathan dwelt. 'My son,' answered the latter cheerfully, 'there is none\r\nin these parts who is better able than I to show thee that; wherefore,\r\nwhenas it pleaseth thee, I will carry thee thither.' Mithridanes\r\nrejoined that this would be very acceptable to him, but that, an it\r\nmight be, he would fain be neither seen nor known of Nathan; and the\r\nlatter said, 'That also will I do, since it pleaseth thee.'\r\nMithridanes accordingly dismounted and repaired to the goodly palace,\r\nin company with Nathan, who quickly engaged him in most pleasant\r\ndiscourse. There he caused one of his servants take the young man's\r\nhorse and putting his mouth to his ear, charged him take order with\r\nall those of the house, so none should tell the youth that he was\r\nNathan; and so was it done. Moreover, he lodged him in a very goodly\r\nchamber, where none saw him, save those whom he had deputed to this\r\nservice, and let entertain him with the utmost honour, himself bearing\r\nhim company.\r\n\r\nAfter Mithridanes had abidden with him awhile on this wise, he asked\r\nhim (albeit he held him in reverence as a father) who he was; to which\r\nNathan answered, 'I am an unworthy servant of Nathan, who have grown\r\nold with him from my childhood, nor hath he ever advanced me to\r\notherwhat than that which thou seest me; wherefore, albeit every one\r\nelse is mighty well pleased with him, I for my part have little cause\r\nto thank him.' These words afforded Mithridanes some hope of availing\r\nwith more certitude and more safety to give effect to his perverse\r\ndesign, and Nathan very courteously asking him who he was and what\r\noccasion brought him into those parts and proffering him his advice\r\nand assistance insomuch as lay in his power, he hesitated awhile to\r\nreply, but, presently, resolving to trust himself to him, he with a\r\nlong circuit of words[445] required him first of secrecy and after of\r\naid and counsel and entirely discovered to him who he was and\r\nwherefore and on what motion he came. Nathan, hearing his discourse\r\nand his cruel design, was inwardly all disordered; but nevertheless,\r\nwithout much hesitation, he answered him with an undaunted mind and a\r\nfirm countenance, saying, 'Mithridanes, thy father was a noble man and\r\nthou showest thyself minded not to degenerate from him, in having\r\nentered upon so high an emprise as this thou hast undertaken, to wit,\r\nto be liberal unto all; and greatly do I commend the jealousy thou\r\nbearest unto Nathan's virtues, for that, were there many such,[446]\r\nthe world, that is most wretched, would soon become good. The design\r\nthat thou hast discovered to me I will without fail keep secret; but\r\nfor the accomplishment thereof I can rather give thee useful counsel\r\nthan great help; the which is this. Thou mayst from here see a\r\ncoppice, maybe half a mile hence, wherein Nathan well nigh every\r\nmorning walketh all alone, taking his pleasure there a pretty long\r\nwhile; and there it will be a light matter to thee to find him and do\r\nthy will of him. If thou slay him, thou must, so thou mayst return\r\nhome without hindrance, get thee gone, not by that way thou camest,\r\nbut by that which thou wilt see issue forth of the coppice on the left\r\nhand, for that, albeit it is somewhat wilder, it is nearer to thy\r\ncountry and safer for thee.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 445: Or as we should say, \"After much beating about the\r\nbush.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 446: _i.e._ jealousies.]\r\n\r\nMithridanes, having received this information and Nathan having taken\r\nleave of him, privily let his companions, who had, like himself, taken\r\nup their sojourn in the palace, know where they should look for him on\r\nthe morrow; and the new day came, Nathan, whose intent was nowise at\r\nvariance with the counsel he had given Mithridanes nor was anywise\r\nchanged, betook himself alone to the coppice, there to die. Meanwhile,\r\nMithridanes arose and taking his bow and his sword, for other arms he\r\nhad not, mounted to horse and made for the coppice, where he saw\r\nNathan from afar go walking all alone. Being resolved, ere he attacked\r\nhim, to seek to see him and hear him speak, he ran towards him and\r\nseizing him by the fillet he had about his head, said, 'Old man, thou\r\nart dead.' Whereto Nathan answered no otherwhat than, 'Then have I\r\nmerited it.' Mithridanes, hearing his voice and looking him in the\r\nface, knew him forthright for him who had so lovingly received him\r\nand familiarly companied with him and faithfully counselled him;\r\nwhereupon his fury incontinent subsided and his rage was changed into\r\nshame. Accordingly, casting away the sword, which he had already\r\npulled out to smite him, and lighting down from his horse, he ran,\r\nweeping, to throw himself at Nathan's feet and said to him, 'Now,\r\ndearest father, do I manifestly recognize your liberality, considering\r\nwith what secrecy you are come hither to give me your life, whereof,\r\nwithout any reason, I showed myself desirous, and that to yourself;\r\nbut God, more careful of mine honour than I myself, hath, in the\r\nextremest hour of need, opened the eyes of my understanding, which\r\nvile envy had closed. Wherefore, the readier you have been to comply\r\nwith me, so much the more do I confess myself beholden to do penance\r\nfor my default. Take, then, of me the vengeance which you deem\r\nconformable to my sin.'\r\n\r\nNathan raised Mithridanes to his feet and tenderly embraced and kissed\r\nhim, saying, 'My son, it needeth not that thou shouldst ask nor that I\r\nshould grant forgiveness of thine emprise, whatever thou choosest to\r\nstyle it, whether wicked or otherwise; for that thou pursuedst it, not\r\nof hatred, but to win to be held better. Live, then, secure from me\r\nand be assured that there is no man alive who loveth thee as I do,\r\nhaving regard to the loftiness of thy soul, which hath given itself,\r\nnot to the amassing of monies, as do the covetous, but to the\r\nexpenditure of those that have been amassed. Neither be thou ashamed\r\nof having sought to slay me, so though mightest become famous, nor\r\nthink that I marvel thereat. The greatest emperors and the most\r\nillustrious kings have, with well nigh none other art than that of\r\nslaying, not one man, as thou wouldst have done, but an infinite\r\nmultitude of men, and burning countries and razing cities, enlarged\r\ntheir realms and consequently their fame; wherefore, an thou wouldst,\r\nto make thyself more famous, have slain me only, thou diddest no new\r\nnor extraordinary thing, but one much used.'\r\n\r\nMithridanes, without holding himself excused of his perverse design,\r\ncommended the honourable excuse found by Nathan and came, in course of\r\nconverse with him, to say that he marvelled beyond measure how he\r\ncould have brought himself to meet his death and have gone so far as\r\neven to give him means and counsel to that end; whereto quoth Nathan,\r\n'Mithridanes, I would not have thee marvel at my resolution nor at the\r\ncounsel I gave thee, for that, since I have been mine own master and\r\nhave addressed myself to do that same thing which thou hast undertaken\r\nto do, there came never any to my house but I contented him, so far as\r\nin me lay, of that which was required of me by him. Thou camest\r\nhither, desirous of my life; wherefore, learning that thou soughtest\r\nit, I straightway determined to give it thee, so thou mightest not be\r\nthe only one to depart hence without his wish; and in order that thou\r\nmightest have thy desire, I gave thee such counsel as I thought apt to\r\nenable thee to have my life and not lose thine own; and therefore I\r\ntell thee once more and pray thee, an it please thee, take it and\r\nsatisfy thyself thereof. I know not how I may better bestow it. These\r\nfourscore years have I occupied it and used it about my pleasures and\r\nmy diversions, and I know that in the course of nature, according as\r\nit fareth with other men and with things in general, it can now be\r\nleft me but a little while longer; wherefore I hold it far better to\r\nbestow it by way of gift, like as I have still given and expended my\r\n[other] treasures, than to seek to keep it until such times as it\r\nshall be taken from me by nature against my will. To give an hundred\r\nyears is no great boon; how much less, then, is it to give the six or\r\neight I have yet to abide here? Take it, then, an it like thee.\r\nPrithee, then, take it, an thou have a mind thereto; for that never\r\nyet, what while I have lived here, have I found any who hath desired\r\nit, nor know I when I may find any such, an thou, who demandest it,\r\ntake it not. And even should I chance to find any one, I know that,\r\nthe longer I keep it, the less worth will it be; therefore, ere it wax\r\nsorrier, take it, I beseech thee.'\r\n\r\nMithridanes was sore abashed and replied, 'God forbid I should, let\r\nalone take and sever from you a thing of such price as your life, but\r\neven desire to do so, as but late I did,--your life, whose years far\r\nfrom seeking to lessen, I would willingly add thereto of mine own!'\r\nWhereto Nathan straightway rejoined, 'And art thou indeed willing, it\r\nbeing in thy power to do it, to add of thy years unto mine and in so\r\ndoing, to cause me do for thee that which I never yet did for any man,\r\nto wit, take of thy good, I who never yet took aught of others?' 'Ay\r\nam I,' answered Mithridanes in haste. 'Then,' said Nathan, 'thou must\r\ndo as I shall bid thee. Thou shalt take up thine abode, young as thou\r\nart, here in my house and bear the name of Nathan, whilst I will\r\nbetake myself to thy house and let still call myself Mithridanes.'\r\nQuoth Mithridanes, 'An I knew how to do as well as you have done and\r\ndo, I would, without hesitation, take that which you proffer me; but,\r\nsince meseemeth very certain that my actions would be a diminishment\r\nof Nathan's fame and as I purpose not to mar in another that which I\r\nknow not how to order in myself, I will not take it.' These and many\r\nother courteous discourses having passed between them, they returned,\r\nat Nathan's instance, to the latter's palace, where he entertained\r\nMithridanes with the utmost honour sundry days, heartening him in his\r\ngreat and noble purpose with all manner of wit and wisdom. Then,\r\nMithridanes desiring to return to his own house with his company, he\r\ndismissed him, having throughly given him to know that he might never\r\navail to outdo him in liberality.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Tenth]\r\n\r\n     MESSER GENTILE DE' CARISENDI, COMING FROM MODONA, TAKETH\r\n     FORTH OF THE SEPULCHRE A LADY WHOM HE LOVETH AND WHO HATH\r\n     BEEN BURIED FOR DEAD. THE LADY, RESTORED TO LIFE, BEARETH A\r\n     MALE CHILD AND MESSER GENTILE RESTORETH HER AND HER SON TO\r\n     NICCOLUCCIO CACCIANIMICO, HER HUSBAND\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed to all a marvellous thing that a man should be lavish of his\r\nown blood and they declared Nathan's liberality to have verily\r\ntranscended that of the King of Spain and the Abbot of Cluny. But,\r\nafter enough to one and the other effect had been said thereof, the\r\nking, looking towards Lauretta, signed to her that he would have her\r\ntell, whereupon she straightway began, \"Young ladies, magnificent and\r\ngoodly are the things that have been recounted, nor meseemeth is there\r\naught left unto us who have yet to tell, wherethrough we may range a\r\nstory-telling, so throughly have they all[447] been occupied with the\r\nloftiness of the magnificences related, except we have recourse to the\r\naffairs of love, which latter afford a great abundance of matter for\r\ndiscourse on every subject; wherefore, at once on this account and for\r\nthat the theme is one to which our age must needs especially incline\r\nus, it pleaseth me to relate to you an act of magnanimity done by a\r\nlover, which, all things considered, will peradventure appear to you\r\nnowise inferior to any of those already set forth, if it be true that\r\ntreasures are lavished, enmities forgotten and life itself, nay, what\r\nis far more, honour and renown, exposed to a thousand perils, so we\r\nmay avail to possess the thing beloved.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 447: _i.e._ all sections of the given theme.]\r\n\r\nThere was, then, in Bologna, a very noble city of Lombardy, a\r\ngentleman very notable for virtue and nobility of blood, called Messer\r\nGentile Carisendi, who, being young, became enamoured of a noble lady\r\ncalled Madam Catalina, the wife of one Niccoluccio Caccianimico; and\r\nfor that he was ill repaid of his love by the lady, being named\r\nprovost of Modona, he betook himself thither, as in despair of her.\r\nMeanwhile, Niccoluccio being absent from Bologna and the lady having,\r\nfor that she was with child, gone to abide at a country house she had\r\nmaybe three miles distant from the city, she was suddenly seized with\r\na grievous fit of sickness,[448] which overcame her with such violence\r\nthat it extinguished in her all sign of life, so that she was even\r\nadjudged dead of divers physicians; and for that her nearest kinswomen\r\ndeclared themselves to have had it from herself that she had not been\r\nso long pregnant that the child could be fully formed, without giving\r\nthemselves farther concern, they buried her, such as she was, after\r\nmuch lamentation, in one of the vaults of a neighbouring church.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 448: Lit. accident (_accidente_).]\r\n\r\nThe thing was forthright signified by a friend of his to Messer\r\nGentile, who, poor as he had still been of her favour, grieved sore\r\ntherefor and ultimately said in himself, 'Harkye, Madam Catalina, thou\r\nart dead, thou of whom, what while thou livedst, I could never avail\r\nto have so much as a look; wherefore, now thou canst not defend\r\nthyself, needs must I take of thee a kiss or two, all dead as thou\r\nart.' This said, he took order so his going should be secret and it\r\nbeing presently night, he mounted to horse with one of his servants\r\nand rode, without halting, till he came whereas the lady was buried\r\nand opened the sepulchre with all despatch. Then, entering therein, he\r\nlaid himself beside her and putting his face to hers, kissed her again\r\nand again with many tears. But presently,--as we see men's appetites\r\nnever abide content within any limit, but still desire farther, and\r\nespecially those of lovers,--having bethought himself to tarry there\r\nno longer, he said, 'Marry, now that I am here, why should I not touch\r\nher somedele on the breast? I may never touch her more, nor have I\r\never yet done so.' Accordingly, overcome with this desire, he put his\r\nhand into her bosom and holding it there awhile, himseemed he felt her\r\nheart beat somewhat. Thereupon, putting aside all fear, he sought more\r\ndiligently and found that she was certainly not dead, scant and feeble\r\nas he deemed the life [that lingered in her;] wherefore, with the help\r\nof his servant, he brought her forth of the tomb, as softliest he\r\nmight, and setting her before him on his horse, carried her privily to\r\nhis house in Bologna.\r\n\r\nThere was his mother, a worthy and discreet gentlewoman, and she,\r\nafter she had heard everything at large from her son, moved to\r\ncompassion, quietly addressed herself by means of hot baths and great\r\nfires to recall the strayed life to the lady, who, coming presently to\r\nherself, heaved a great sigh and said, 'Ah me, where am I?' To which\r\nthe good lady replied, 'Be of good comfort; thou art in safety.' Madam\r\nCatalina, collecting herself, looked about her and knew not aright\r\nwhere she was; but, seeing Messer Gentile before her, she was filled\r\nwith wonderment and besought his mother to tell her how she came\r\nthither; whereupon Messer Gentile related to her everything in order.\r\nAt this she was sore afflicted, but presently rendered him such thanks\r\nas she might and after conjured him, by the love he had erst borne her\r\nand of his courtesy, that she might not in his house suffer at his\r\nhands aught that should be anywise contrary to her honour and that of\r\nher husband and that, as soon as the day should be come, he would\r\nsuffer her return to her own house. 'Madam,' answered Messer Gentile,\r\n'whatsoever may have been my desire of time past, I purpose not,\r\neither at this present or ever henceforth, (since God hath vouchsafed\r\nme this grace that He hath restored you to me from death to life, and\r\nthat by means of the love I have hitherto borne you,) to use you\r\neither here or elsewhere otherwise than as a dear sister; but this my\r\nservice that I have done you to-night meriteth some recompense;\r\nwherefore I would have you deny me not a favour that I shall ask you.'\r\n\r\nThe lady very graciously replied that she was ready to do his desire,\r\nso but she might and it were honourable. Then said he, 'Madam, your\r\nkinsfolk and all the Bolognese believe and hold you for certain to be\r\ndead, wherefore there is no one who looketh for you more at home, and\r\ntherefore I would have you of your favour be pleased to abide quietly\r\nhere with my mother till such time as I shall return from Modona,\r\nwhich will be soon. And the reason for which I require you of this is\r\nthat I purpose to make a dear and solemn present of you to your\r\nhusband in the presence of the most notable citizens of this place.'\r\nThe lady, confessing herself beholden to the gentleman and that his\r\nrequest was an honourable one, determined to do as he asked, how much\r\nsoever she desired to gladden her kinsfolk of her life,[449] and so\r\nshe promised it to him upon her faith. Hardly had she made an end of\r\nher reply, when she felt the time of her delivery to be come and not\r\nlong after, being lovingly tended of Messer Gentile's mother, she gave\r\nbirth to a goodly male child, which manifold redoubled his gladness\r\nand her own. Messer Gentile took order that all things needful should\r\nbe forthcoming and that she should be tended as she were his proper\r\nwife and presently returned in secret to Modona. There, having served\r\nthe term of his office and being about to return to Bologna, he took\r\norder for the holding of a great and goodly banquet at his house on\r\nthe morning he was to enter the city, and thereto he bade many\r\ngentlemen of the place, amongst whom was Niccoluccio Caccianimico.\r\nAccordingly, when he returned and dismounted, he found them all\r\nawaiting him, as likewise the lady, fairer and sounder than ever, and\r\nher little son in good case, and with inexpressible joy seating his\r\nguests at table, he let serve them magnificently with various meats.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 449: _i.e._ with news of her life.]\r\n\r\nWhenas the repast was near its end, having first told the lady what he\r\nmeant to do and taken order with her of the course that she should\r\nhold, he began to speak thus: 'Gentlemen, I remember to have heard\r\nwhiles that there is in Persia a custom and to my thinking a pleasant\r\none, to wit, that, whenas any is minded supremely to honour a friend\r\nof his, he biddeth him to his house and there showeth him the thing,\r\nbe it wife or mistress or daughter or whatsoever else, he holdeth most\r\ndear, avouching that, like as he showeth him this, even so, an he\r\nmight, would he yet more willingly show him his very heart; which\r\ncustom I purpose to observe in Bologna. You, of your favour, have\r\nhonoured my banquet with your presence, and I in turn mean to honour\r\nyou, after the Persian fashion, by showing you the most precious thing\r\nI have or may ever have in the world. But, ere I proceed to do this, I\r\npray you tell me what you deem of a doubt[450] which I shall broach to\r\nyou and which is this. A certain person hath in his house a very\r\nfaithful and good servant, who falleth grievously sick, whereupon the\r\nformer, without awaiting the sick man's end, letteth carry him into\r\nthe middle street and hath no more heed of him. Cometh a stranger,\r\nwho, moved to compassion of the sick man, carrieth him off to his own\r\nhouse and with great diligence and expense bringeth him again to his\r\nformer health. Now I would fain know whether, if he keep him and make\r\nuse of his services, his former master can in equity complain of or\r\nblame the second, if, he demanding him again, the latter refuse to\r\nrestore him.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 450: _Dubbio_, _i.e._ a doubtful case or question.]\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen, after various discourse among themselves, concurring\r\nall in one opinion, committed the response to Niccoluccio\r\nCaccianimico, for that he was a goodly and eloquent speaker; whereupon\r\nthe latter, having first commended the Persian usage, declared that he\r\nand all the rest were of opinion that the first master had no longer\r\nany right in his servant, since he had, in such a circumstance, not\r\nonly abandoned him, but cast him away, and that, for the kind offices\r\ndone him by the second, themseemed the servant was justly become his;\r\nwherefore, in keeping him, he did the first no hurt, no violence, no\r\nunright whatsoever. The other guests at table (and there were men\r\nthere of worth and worship) said all of one accord that they held to\r\nthat which had been answered by Niccoluccio; and Messer Gentile, well\r\npleased with this response and that Niccoluccio had made it, avouched\r\nhimself also to be of the same opinion. Then said he, 'It is now time\r\nthat I honour you according to promise,' and calling two of his\r\nservants, despatched them to the lady, whom he had let magnificently\r\ndress and adorn, praying her be pleased to come gladden the company\r\nwith her presence. Accordingly, she took her little son, who was very\r\nhandsome, in her arms and coming into the banqueting-hall, attended by\r\ntwo serving-men seated herself, as Messer Gentile willed it, by the\r\nside of a gentleman of high standing. Then said he, 'Gentlemen, this\r\nis the thing which I hold and purpose to hold dearer than any other;\r\nlook if it seem to you that I have reason to do so.'\r\n\r\nThe guests, having paid her the utmost honour, commending her amain\r\nand declaring to Messer Gentile that he might well hold her dear, fell\r\nto looking upon her; and there were many there who had avouched her to\r\nbe herself,[451] had they not held her for dead. But Niccoluccio gazed\r\nupon her above all and unable to contain himself, asked her, (Messer\r\nGentile having withdrawn awhile,) as one who burned to know who she\r\nwas, if she were a Bolognese lady or a foreigner. The lady, seeing\r\nherself questioned of her husband, hardly restrained herself from\r\nanswering; but yet, to observe the appointed ordinance, she held her\r\npeace. Another asked her if the child was hers and a third if she were\r\nMesser Gentile's wife or anywise akin to him; but she made them no\r\nreply. Presently, Messer Gentile coming up, one of his guests said to\r\nhim, 'Sir, this is a fair creature of yours, but she seemeth to us\r\nmute; is she so?' 'Gentlemen,' replied he, 'her not having spoken at\r\nthis present is no small proof of her virtue.' And the other said,\r\n'Tell us, then, who she is.' Quoth Messer Gentile, 'That will I\r\ngladly, so but you will promise me that none, for aught that I shall\r\nsay, will budge from his place till such time as I shall have made an\r\nend of my story.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 451: _i.e._ who would have recognized her as Madam\r\nCatalina.]\r\n\r\nAll promised this and the tables being presently removed, Messer\r\nGentile, seating himself beside the lady, said, 'Gentlemen, this lady\r\nis that loyal and faithful servant, of whom I questioned you awhile\r\nagone and who, being held little dear of her folk and so, as a thing\r\nwithout worth and no longer useful, cast out into the midward of the\r\nstreet, was by me taken up; yea, by my solicitude and of my handiwork\r\nI brought her forth of the jaws of death, and God, having regard to my\r\ngood intent, hath caused her, by my means, from a frightful corpse\r\nbecome thus beautiful. But, that you may more manifestly apprehend how\r\nthis betided me, I will briefly declare it to you.' Then, beginning\r\nfrom his falling enamoured of her, he particularly related to them\r\nthat which had passed until that time, to the great wonderment of the\r\nhearers, and added, 'By reason of which things, an you, and especially\r\nNiccoluccio, have not changed counsel since awhile ago, the lady is\r\nfairly mine, nor can any with just title demand her again of me.' To\r\nthis none made answer; nay, all awaited that which he should say\r\nfarther; whilst Niccoluccio and the lady and certain of the others\r\nwho were there wept for compassion.[452]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 452: _Compassione_, _i.e._ emotion.]\r\n\r\nThen Messer Gentile, rising to his feet and taking the little child in\r\nhis arms and the lady by the hand, made for Niccoluccio and said to\r\nhim, 'Rise up, gossip; I do not restore thee thy wife, whom thy\r\nkinsfolk and hers cast away; nay, but I will well bestow on thee this\r\nlady my gossip, with this her little son, who I am assured, was\r\nbegotten of thee and whom I held at baptism and named Gentile; and I\r\npray thee that she be none the less dear to thee for that she hath\r\nabidden near upon three months in my house; for I swear to thee,--by\r\nthat God who belike caused me aforetime fall in love with her, to the\r\nintent that my love might be, as in effect it hath been, the occasion\r\nof her deliverance,--that never, whether with father or mother or with\r\nthee, hath she lived more chastely than she hath done with my mother\r\nin my house.' So saying, he turned to the lady and said to her,\r\n'Madam, from this time forth I absolve you of every promise made me\r\nand leave you free [to return] to Niccoluccio.'[453] Then, giving the\r\nlady and the child into Niccoluccio's arms, he returned to his seat.\r\nNiccoluccio received them with the utmost eagerness, so much the more\r\nrejoiced as he was the farther removed from hope thereof, and thanked\r\nMesser Gentile, as best he might and knew; whilst the others, who all\r\nwept for compassion, commended the latter amain of this; yea, and he\r\nwas commended of whosoever heard it. The lady was received in her\r\nhouse with marvellous rejoicing and long beheld with amazement by the\r\nBolognese, as one raised from the dead; whilst Messer Gentile ever\r\nafter abode a friend of Niccoluccio and of his kinsfolk and those of\r\nthe lady.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 453: Lit. I leave you free _of_ Niccoluccio (_libera vi\r\nlascio di Niccoluccio_).]\r\n\r\nWhat, then, gentle ladies, will you say [of this case]? Is, think you,\r\na king's having given away his sceptre and his crown or an abbot's\r\nhaving, without cost to himself, reconciled an evildoer with the pope\r\nor an old man's having proffered his weasand to the enemy's knife to\r\nbe evened with this deed of Messer Gentile, who, being young and\r\nardent and himseeming he had a just title to that which the\r\nheedlessness of others had cast away and he of his good fortune had\r\ntaken up, not only honourably tempered his ardour, but, having in his\r\npossession that which he was still wont with all his thoughts to covet\r\nand to seek to steal away, freely restored it [to its owner]? Certes,\r\nmeseemeth none of the magnificences already recounted can compare with\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Tenth]\r\n\r\n     MADAM DIANORA REQUIRETH OF MESSER ANSALDO A GARDEN AS FAIR\r\n     IN JANUARY AS IN MAY, AND HE BY BINDING HIMSELF [TO PAY A\r\n     GREAT SUM OF MONEY] TO A NIGROMANCER, GIVETH IT TO HER. HER\r\n     HUSBAND GRANTETH HER LEAVE TO DO MESSER ANSALDO'S PLEASURE,\r\n     BUT HE, HEARING OF THE FORMER'S GENEROSITY, ABSOLVETH HER OF\r\n     HER PROMISE, WHEREUPON THE NIGROMANCER, IN HIS TURN,\r\n     ACQUITTETH MESSER ANSALDO OF HIS BOND, WITHOUT WILLING AUGHT\r\n     OF HIS\r\n\r\n\r\nMesser Gentile having by each of the merry company been extolled to\r\nthe very skies with the highest praise, the king charged Emilia follow\r\non, who confidently, as if eager to speak, began as follows: \"Dainty\r\ndames, none can with reason deny that Messer Gentile wrought\r\nmagnificently; but, if it be sought to say that his magnanimity might\r\nnot be overpassed, it will not belike be uneath to show that more is\r\npossible, as I purpose to set out to you in a little story of mine.\r\n\r\nIn Friuli, a country, though cold, glad with goodly mountains and\r\nstore of rivers and clear springs, is a city called Udine, wherein was\r\naforetime a fair and noble lady called Madam Dianora, the wife of a\r\nwealthy gentleman named Gilberto, who was very debonair and easy of\r\ncomposition. The lady's charm procured her to be passionately loved of\r\na noble and great baron by name Messer Ansaldo Gradense, a man of high\r\ncondition and everywhere renowned for prowess and courtesy. He loved\r\nher fervently and did all that lay in his power to be beloved of her,\r\nto which end he frequently solicited her with messages, but wearied\r\nhimself in vain. At last, his importunities being irksome to the lady\r\nand she seeing that, for all she denied him everything he sought of\r\nher, he stinted not therefor to love and solicit her, she determined\r\nto seek to rid herself of him by means of an extraordinary and in her\r\njudgment an impossible demand; wherefore she said one day to a woman,\r\nwho came often to her on his part, 'Good woman, thou hast many times\r\navouched to me that Messer Ansaldo loveth me over all things and hast\r\nproffered me marvellous great gifts on his part, which I would have\r\nhim keep to himself, seeing that never thereby might I be prevailed\r\nupon to love him or comply with his wishes; but, an I could be\r\ncertified that he loveth me in very deed as much as thou sayest, I\r\nmight doubtless bring myself to love him and do that which he willeth;\r\nwherefore, an he choose to certify me of this with that which I shall\r\nrequire of him, I shall be ready to do his commandments.' Quoth the\r\ngood woman, 'And what is that, madam, which you would have him do?'\r\n'That which I desire,' replied the lady, 'is this; I will have, for\r\nthis coming month of January, a garden, near this city, full of green\r\ngrass and flowers and trees in full leaf, no otherwise than as it were\r\nMay; the which if he contrive not, let him never more send me thee nor\r\nany other, for that, an he importune me more, so surely as I have\r\nhitherto kept his pursuit hidden from my husband and my kinsfolk, I\r\nwill study to rid myself of him by complaining to them.'\r\n\r\nThe gentleman, hearing the demand and the offer of his mistress, for\r\nall it seemed to him a hard thing and in a manner impossible to do and\r\nhe knew it to be required of the lady for none otherwhat than to\r\nbereave him of all hope, determined nevertheless to essay whatsoever\r\nmight be done thereof and sent into various parts about the world,\r\nenquiring if there were any to be found who would give him aid and\r\ncounsel in the matter. At last, he happened upon one who offered, so\r\nhe were well guerdoned, to do the thing by nigromantic art, and having\r\nagreed with him for a great sum of money, he joyfully awaited the\r\nappointed time, which come and the cold being extreme and everything\r\nfull of snow and ice, the learned man, the night before the calends of\r\nJanuary, so wrought by his arts in a very goodly meadow adjoining the\r\ncity, that it appeared in the morning (according to the testimony of\r\nthose who saw it) one of the goodliest gardens was ever seen of any,\r\nwith grass and trees and fruits of every kind. Messer Ansaldo, after\r\nviewing this with the utmost gladness, let cull of the finest fruits\r\nand the fairest flowers that were there and caused privily present\r\nthem to his mistress, bidding her come and see the garden required by\r\nher, so thereby she might know how he loved her and after, remembering\r\nher of the promise made him and sealed with an oath, bethink herself,\r\nas a loyal lady, to accomplish it to him.\r\n\r\nThe lady, seeing the fruits and flowers and having already from many\r\nheard tell of the miraculous garden, began to repent of her promise.\r\nNatheless, curious, for all her repentance, of seeing strange things,\r\nshe went with many other ladies of the city to view the garden and\r\nhaving with no little wonderment commended it amain, returned home,\r\nthe woefullest woman alive, bethinking her of that to which she was\r\nbounden thereby. Such was her chagrin that she availed not so well to\r\ndissemble it but needs must it appear, and her husband, perceiving it,\r\nwas urgent to know the reason. The lady, for shamefastness, kept\r\nsilence thereof a great while; but at last, constrained to speak, she\r\norderly discovered to him everything; which Gilberto, hearing, was at\r\nthe first sore incensed, but presently, considering the purity of the\r\nlady's intent and chasing away anger with better counsel, he said,\r\n'Dianora, it is not the part of a discreet nor of a virtuous woman to\r\ngive ear unto any message of this sort nor to compound with any for\r\nher chastity under whatsoever condition. Words received into the heart\r\nby the channel of the ears have more potency than many conceive and\r\nwell nigh every thing becometh possible to lovers. Thou didst ill,\r\nthen, first to hearken and after to enter into terms of composition;\r\nbut, for that I know the purity of thine intent, I will, to absolve\r\nthee of the bond of the promise, concede thee that which peradventure\r\nnone other would do, being thereto the more induced by fear of the\r\nnigromancer, whom Messer Ansaldo, an thou cheat him, will maybe cause\r\nmake us woeful. I will, then, that thou go to him and study to have\r\nthyself absolved of this thy promise, preserving thy chastity, if thou\r\nmayst anywise contrive it; but, an it may not be otherwise, thou\r\nshalt, for this once, yield him thy body, but not thy soul.'\r\n\r\nThe lady, hearing her husband's speech, wept and denied herself\r\nwilling to receive such a favour from him; but, for all her much\r\ndenial, he would e'en have it be so. Accordingly, next morning, at\r\ndaybreak, the lady, without overmuch adorning herself, repaired to\r\nMesser Ansaldo's house, with two of her serving-men before and a\r\nchamberwoman after her. Ansaldo, hearing that his mistress was come to\r\nhim, marvelled sore and letting call the nigromancer, said to him, 'I\r\nwill have thee see what a treasure thy skill hath gotten me.' Then,\r\ngoing to meet her, he received her with decency and reverence, without\r\nensuing any disorderly appetite, and they entered all[454] into a\r\ngoodly chamber, wherein was a great fire. There he caused set her a\r\nseat and said, 'Madam, I prithee, if the long love I have borne you\r\nmerit any recompense, let it not irk you to discover to me the true\r\ncause which hath brought you hither at such an hour and in such\r\ncompany.' The lady, shamefast and well nigh with tears in her eyes,\r\nanswered, 'Sir, neither love that I bear you nor plighted faith\r\nbringeth me hither, but the commandment of my husband, who, having\r\nmore regard to the travails of your disorderly passion than to his\r\nhonour and mine own, hath caused me come hither; and by his behest I\r\nam for this once disposed to do your every pleasure.' If Messer\r\nAnsaldo had marvelled at the sight of the lady, far more did he\r\nmarvel, when he heard her words, and moved by Gilberto's generosity,\r\nhis heat began to change to compassion and he said, 'God forbid,\r\nmadam, an it be as you say, that I should be a marrer of his honour\r\nwho hath compassion of my love; wherefore you shall, what while it is\r\nyour pleasure to abide here, be no otherwise entreated than as you\r\nwere my sister; and whenas it shall be agreeable to you, you are free\r\nto depart, so but you will render your husband, on my part, those\r\nthanks which you shall deem befitting unto courtesy such as his hath\r\nbeen and have me ever, in time to come, for brother and for servant.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 454: _i.e._ Ansaldo, Dianora and the nigromancer.]\r\n\r\nThe lady, hearing these words, was the joyfullest woman in the world\r\nand answered, saying, 'Nothing, having regard to your fashions, could\r\never make me believe that aught should ensue to me of my coming other\r\nthan this that I see you do in the matter; whereof I shall still be\r\nbeholden to you.' Then, taking leave, she returned, under honourable\r\nescort, to Messer Gilberto and told him that which had passed, of\r\nwhich there came about a very strait and loyal friendship between him\r\nand Messer Ansaldo. Moreover, the nigromancer, to whom the gentleman\r\nwas for giving the promised guerdon, seeing Gilberto's generosity\r\ntowards his wife's lover and that of the latter towards the lady,\r\nsaid, 'God forbid, since I have seen Gilberto liberal of his honour\r\nand you of your love, that I should not on like wise be liberal of my\r\nhire; wherefore, knowing it[455] will stand you in good stead, I\r\nintend that it shall be yours.' At this the gentleman was ashamed and\r\nstudied to make him take or all or part; but, seeing that he wearied\r\nhimself in vain and it pleasing the nigromancer (who had, after three\r\ndays, done away his garden) to depart, he commended him to God and\r\nhaving extinguished from his heart his lustful love for the lady, he\r\nabode fired with honourable affection for her. How say you now,\r\nlovesome ladies? Shall we prefer [Gentile's resignation of] the in a\r\nmanner dead lady and of his love already cooled for hope forspent,\r\nbefore the generosity of Messer Ansaldo, whose love was more ardent\r\nthan ever and who was in a manner fired with new hope, holding in his\r\nhands the prey so long pursued? Meseemeth it were folly to pretend\r\nthat this generosity can be evened with that.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 455: _i.e._ the money promised him by way of recompense.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Tenth]\r\n\r\n     KING CHARLES THE OLD, THE VICTORIOUS, FALLETH ENAMOURED OF A\r\n     YOUNG GIRL, BUT AFTER, ASHAMED OF HIS FOND THOUGHT,\r\n     HONOURABLY MARRIETH BOTH HER AND HER SISTER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt were over longsome fully to recount the various discourse that had\r\nplace among the ladies of who used the greatest generosity, Gilberto\r\nor Messer Ansaldo or the nigromancer, in Madam Dianora's affairs; but,\r\nafter the king had suffered them debate awhile, he looked at Fiammetta\r\nand bade her, telling a story, put an end to their contention;\r\nwhereupon she, without hesitation, began as follows: \"Illustrious\r\nladies, I was ever of opinion that, in companies such as ours, it\r\nshould still be discoursed so much at large that the overstraitness[456]\r\nof intent of the things said be not unto any matter for debate, the\r\nwhich is far more sortable among students in the schools than among us\r\n[women,] who scarce suffice unto the distaff and the spindle.\r\nWherefore, seeing that you are presently at cross-purposes by reason\r\nof the things already said, I, who had in mind a thing maybe somewhat\r\ndoubtful [of meaning,] will leave that be and tell you a story,\r\ntreating nowise of a man of little account, but of a valiant king, who\r\ntherein wrought knightly, in nothing attainting his honour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 456: _i.e._, nicety, minuteness (_strettezza_).]\r\n\r\nEach one of you must many a time have heard tell of King Charles the\r\nOld or First, by whose magnanimous emprise, and after by the glorious\r\nvictory gained by him over King Manfred, the Ghibellines were expelled\r\nfrom Florence and the Guelphs returned thither. In consequence of this\r\na certain gentleman, called Messer Neri degli Uberti, departing the\r\ncity with all his household and much monies and being minded to take\r\nrefuge no otherwhere than under the hand of King Charles, betook\r\nhimself to Castellamare di Stabia.[457] There, belike a crossbowshot\r\nremoved from the other habitations of the place, among olive-trees\r\nand walnuts and chestnuts, wherewith the country aboundeth, he bought\r\nhim an estate and built thereon a goodly and commodious\r\ndwelling-house, with a delightsome garden thereby, amiddleward which,\r\nhaving great plenty of running water, he made, after our country\r\nfashion, a goodly and clear fishpond and lightly filled it with good\r\nstore of fish. Whilst he concerned himself to make his garden goodlier\r\nevery day, it befell that King Charles repaired to Castellamare, to\r\nrest himself awhile in the hot season, and there hearing tell of the\r\nbeauty of Messer Neri's garden, he desired to behold it. Hearing,\r\nmoreover, to whom it belonged, he bethought himself that, as the\r\ngentleman was of the party adverse to his own, it behoved to deal the\r\nmore familiarly with him, and accordingly sent to him to say that he\r\npurposed to sup with him privily in his garden that evening, he and\r\nfour companions. This was very agreeable to Messer Neri, and having\r\nmade magnificent preparation and taken order with his household of\r\nthat which was to do, he received the king in his fair garden as\r\ngladliest he might and knew. The latter, after having viewed and\r\ncommended all the garden and Messer Neri's house and washed, seated\r\nhimself at one of the tables, which were set beside the fishpond, and\r\nseating Count Guy de Montfort, who was of his company, on one side of\r\nhim and Messer Neri on the other, commanded other three, who were come\r\nthither with them, to serve according to the order appointed of his\r\nhost. Thereupon there came dainty meats and there were wines of the\r\nbest and costliest and the ordinance was exceeding goodly and\r\npraiseworthy, without noise or annoy whatsoever, the which the king\r\nmuch commended.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 457: A town on the Bay of Naples, near the ruins of\r\nPompeii.]\r\n\r\nPresently, as he sat blithely at meat, enjoying the solitary place,\r\nthere entered the garden two young damsels of maybe fifteen years of\r\nage, with hair like threads of gold, all ringleted and hanging loose,\r\nwhereon was a light chaplet of pervinck-blossoms. Their faces bespoke\r\nthem rather angels than otherwhat, so delicately fair they were, and\r\nthey were clad each upon her skin in a garment of the finest linen and\r\nwhite as snow, the which from the waist upward was very strait and\r\nthence hung down in ample folds, pavilionwise, to the feet. She who\r\ncame first bore on her left shoulder a pair of hand-nets and in her\r\nright hand a long pole, and the other had on her left shoulder a\r\nfrying-pan and under the same arm a faggot of wood, whilst in her left\r\nhand she held a trivet and in the other a flask of oil and a lighted\r\nflambeau. The king, seeing them, marvelled and in suspense awaited\r\nwhat this should mean. The damsels came forward modestly and\r\nblushingly did obeisance to him, then, betaking themselves whereas one\r\nwent down into the fishpond, she who bore the frying-pan set it down\r\nand the other things by it and taking the pole that the other carried,\r\nthey both entered the water, which came up to their breasts.\r\nMeanwhile, one of Messer Neri's servants deftly kindled fire under the\r\ntrivet and setting the pan thereon, poured therein oil and waited for\r\nthe damsels to throw him fish. The latter, the one groping with the\r\npole in those parts whereas she knew the fish lay hid and the other\r\nstanding ready with the net, in a short space of time took fish\r\ngalore, to the exceeding pleasure of the king, who eyed them attently;\r\nthen, throwing some thereof to the servant, who put them in the pan,\r\nwell nigh alive, they proceeded, as they had been lessoned, to take of\r\nthe finest and cast them on the table before the king and his\r\ntable-fellows. The fish wriggled about the table, to the marvellous\r\ndiversion of the king, who took of them in his turn and sportively\r\ncast them back to the damsels; and on this wise they frolicked awhile,\r\ntill such time as the servant had cooked the fish which had been given\r\nhim and which, Messer Neri having so ordered it, were now set before\r\nthe king, more as a relish than as any very rare and delectable dish.\r\n\r\nThe damsels, seeing the fish cooked and having taken enough, came\r\nforth of the water, their thin white garments all clinging to their\r\nskins and hiding well nigh nought of their delicate bodies, and\r\npassing shamefastly before the king, returned to the house. The latter\r\nand the count and the others who served had well considered the\r\ndamsels and each inwardly greatly commended them for fair and well\r\nshapen, no less than for agreeable and well mannered. But above all\r\nthey pleased the king, who had so intently eyed every part of their\r\nbodies, as they came forth of the water, that, had any then pricked\r\nhim, he would not have felt it, and as he called them more\r\nparticularly to mind, unknowing who they were, he felt a very fervent\r\ndesire awaken in his heart to please them, whereby he right well\r\nperceived himself to be in danger of becoming enamoured, an he took no\r\nheed to himself thereagainst; nor knew he indeed whether of the twain\r\nit was the more pleased him, so like in all things was the one to the\r\nother. After he had abidden awhile in this thought, he turned to\r\nMesser Neri and asked him who were the two damsels, to which the\r\ngentleman answered, 'My lord, these are my daughters born at a birth,\r\nwhereof the one is called Ginevra the Fair and the other Isotta the\r\nBlonde.' The king commended them greatly and exhorted him to marry\r\nthem, whereof Messer Neri excused himself, for that he was no more\r\nable thereunto. Meanwhile, nothing now remaining to be served of the\r\nsupper but the fruits, there came the two damsels in very goodly gowns\r\nof sendal, with two great silver platters in their hands, full of\r\nvarious fruits, such as the season afforded, and these they set on the\r\ntable before the king; which done, they withdrew a little apart and\r\nfell to singing a canzonet, whereof the words began thus:\r\n\r\n       Whereas I'm come, O Love,\r\n     It might not be, indeed, at length recounted, etc.\r\n\r\nThis song they carolled on such dulcet wise and so delightsomely that\r\nto the king, who beheld and hearkened to them with ravishment, it\r\nseemed as if all the hierarchies of the angels were lighted there to\r\nsing. The song sung, they fell on their knees and respectfully craved\r\nof him leave to depart, who, albeit their departure was grievous to\r\nhim, yet with a show of blitheness accorded it to them. The supper\r\nbeing now at an end, the king remounted to horse with his company and\r\nleaving Messer Neri, returned to the royal lodging, devising of one\r\nthing and another. There, holding his passion hidden, but availing\r\nnot, for whatsoever great affair might supervene, to forget the beauty\r\nand grace of Ginevra the Fair, (for love of whom he loved her sister\r\nalso, who was like unto her,) he became so fast entangled in the\r\namorous snares that he could think of well nigh nought else and\r\nfeigning other occasions, kept a strait intimacy with Messer Neri and\r\nvery often visited his fair garden, to see Ginevra.\r\n\r\nAt last, unable to endure longer and bethinking himself, in default of\r\nother means of compassing his desire, to take not one alone, but both\r\nof the damsels from their father, he discovered both his passion and\r\nhis intent to Count Guy, who, for that he was an honourable man, said\r\nto him, 'My lord, I marvel greatly at that which you tell me, and that\r\nmore than would another, inasmuch as meseemeth I have from your\r\nchildhood to this day known your fashions better than any other;\r\nwherefore, meseeming never to have known such a passion in your youth,\r\nwherein Love might lightlier have fixed his talons, and seeing you\r\npresently hard upon old age, it is so new and so strange to me that\r\nyou should love by way of enamourment[458] that it seemeth to me well\r\nnigh a miracle, and were it my office to reprove you thereof, I know\r\nwell that which I should say to you thereanent, having in regard that\r\nyou are yet with your harness on your back in a kingdom newly gained,\r\namidst a people unknown and full of wiles and treasons, and are all\r\noccupied with very grave cares and matters of high moment, nor have\r\nyou yet availed to seat yourself [in security;] and yet, among such\r\nand so many affairs, you have made place for the allurements of love.\r\nThis is not the fashion of a magnanimous king; nay, but rather that of\r\na pusillanimous boy. Moreover, what is far worse, you say that you are\r\nresolved to take his two daughters from a gentleman who hath\r\nentertained you in his house beyond his means and who, to do you the\r\nmore honour, hath shown you these twain in a manner naked, thereby\r\nattesting how great is the faith he hath in you and that he firmly\r\nbelieveth you to be a king and not a ravening wolf. Again, hath it so\r\nsoon dropped your memory that it was the violences done of Manfred to\r\nwomen that opened you the entry into this kingdom? What treason was\r\never wroughten more deserving of eternal punishment than this would\r\nbe, that you should take from him who hospitably entreateth you his\r\nhonour and hope and comfort? What would be said of you, an you should\r\ndo it? You think, maybe, it were a sufficient excuse to say, \"I did it\r\nfor that he is a Ghibelline.\" Is this of the justice of kings, that\r\nthey who resort on such wise to their arms should be entreated after\r\nsuch a fashion, be they who they may? Let me tell you, king, that it\r\nwas an exceedingly great glory to you to have overcome Manfred, but a\r\nfar greater one it is to overcome one's self; wherefore do you, who\r\nhave to correct others, conquer yourself and curb this appetite, nor\r\noffer with such a blot to mar that which you have so gloriously\r\ngained.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 458: _Per amore amiate_ (Fr. aimiez par amour).]\r\n\r\nThese words stung the king's conscience to the quick and afflicted him\r\nthe more inasmuch as he knew them for true; wherefore, after sundry\r\nheavy sighs, he said, 'Certes, Count, I hold every other enemy,\r\nhowever strong, weak and eath enough to the well-lessoned warrior to\r\novercome in comparison with his own appetites; natheless, great as is\r\nthe travail and inexpressible as is the might it requireth, your words\r\nhave so stirred me that needs must I, ere many days be past, cause you\r\nsee by deed that, like as I know how to conquer others, even so do I\r\nknow how to overcome myself.' Nor had many days passed after this\r\ndiscourse when the king, having returned to Naples, determined, as\r\nwell to deprive himself of occasion to do dishonourably as to requite\r\nthe gentleman the hospitality received from him, to go about (grievous\r\nas it was to him to make others possessors of that which he coveted\r\nover all for himself) to marry the two young ladies, and that not as\r\nMesser Neri's daughters, but as his own. Accordingly, with Messer\r\nNeri's accord, he dowered them magnificently and gave Ginevra the Fair\r\nto Messer Maffeo da Palizzi and Isotta the Blonde to Messer Guglielmo\r\ndella Magna, both noble cavaliers and great barons, to whom with\r\ninexpressible chagrin consigning them, he betook himself into Apulia,\r\nwhere with continual fatigues he so mortified the fierceness of his\r\nappetite that, having burst and broken the chains of love, he abode\r\nfree of such passion for the rest of his life. There are some belike\r\nwho will say that it was a little thing for a king to have married two\r\nyoung ladies, and that I will allow; but a great and a very great\r\nthing I call it, if we consider that it was a king enamoured who did\r\nthis and who married to another her whom he loved, without having\r\ngotten or taking of his love leaf or flower or fruit. On this wise,\r\nthen, did this magnanimous king, at once magnificently guerdoning the\r\nnoble gentleman, laudably honouring the young ladies whom he loved and\r\nbravely overcoming himself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Tenth]\r\n\r\n     KING PEDRO OF ARRAGON, COMING TO KNOW THE FERVENT LOVE BORNE\r\n     HIM BY LISA, COMFORTETH THE LOVE-SICK MAID AND PRESENTLY\r\n     MARRIETH HER TO A NOBLE YOUNG GENTLEMAN; THEN, KISSING HER\r\n     ON THE BROW, HE EVER AFTER AVOUCHETH HIMSELF HER KNIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nFiammetta having made an end of her story and the manful magnanimity of\r\nKing Charles having been much commended, albeit there was one lady\r\nthere who, being a Ghibelline, was loath to praise him, Pampinea, by\r\nthe king's commandment, began thus, \"There is no one of understanding,\r\nworshipful ladies, but would say that which you say of good King\r\nCharles, except she bear him ill-will for otherwhat; but, for that\r\nthere occurreth to my memory a thing, belike no less commendable than\r\nthis, done of one his adversary to one of our Florentine damsels, it\r\npleaseth me to relate it to you.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the expulsion of the French from Sicily, one of our\r\nFlorentines was an apothecary at Palermo, a very rich man called\r\nBernardo Puccini, who had by his wife an only daughter, a very fair\r\ndamsel and already apt for marriage. Now King Pedro of Arragon, become\r\nlord of the island, held high festival with his barons at Palermo,\r\nwherein he tilting after the Catalan fashion, it chanced that\r\nBernardo's daughter, whose name was Lisa, saw him running [at the\r\nring] from a window where she was with other ladies, and he so\r\nmarvellously pleased her that, looking upon him once and again, she\r\nfell passionately in love with him; and the festival ended and she\r\nabiding in her father's house, she could think of nothing but of this\r\nher illustrious and exalted love. And what most irked her in this was\r\nthe consciousness of her own mean condition, which scarce suffered her\r\nto cherish any hope of a happy issue; natheless, she could not\r\ntherefor bring herself to leave loving the king, albeit, for fear of\r\ngreater annoy, she dared not discover her passion. The king had not\r\nperceived this thing and recked not of her, wherefor she suffered\r\nintolerable chagrin, past all that can be imagined. Thus it befell\r\nthat, love still waxing in her and melancholy redoubling upon\r\nmelancholy, the fair maid, unable to endure more, fell sick and wasted\r\nvisibly away from day to day, like snow in the sun. Her father and\r\nmother, sore concerned for this that befell her, studied with\r\nassiduous tenderness to hearten her and succoured her in as much as\r\nmight be with physicians and medicines, but it availed nothing, for\r\nthat, despairing of her love, she had elected to live no longer.\r\n\r\nIt chanced one day that, her father offering to do her every pleasure,\r\nshe bethought herself, and she might aptly, to seek, before she died,\r\nto make the king acquainted with her love and her intent, and\r\naccordingly she prayed him bring her Minuccio d'Arezzo. Now this\r\nMinuccio was in those days held a very quaint and subtle singer and\r\nplayer and was gladly seen of the king; and Bernardo concluded that\r\nLisa had a mind to hear him sing and play awhile. Accordingly, he sent\r\nto tell him, and Minuccio, who was a man of a debonair humour,\r\nincontinent came to her and having somedele comforted her with kindly\r\nspeech, softly played her a fit or two on a viol he had with him and\r\nafter sang her sundry songs, the which were fire and flame unto the\r\ndamsel's passion, whereas he thought to solace her. Presently she told\r\nhim that she would fain speak some words with him alone, wherefore,\r\nall else having withdrawn, she said to him, 'Minuccio, I have chosen\r\nthee to keep me very faithfully a secret of mine, hoping in the first\r\nplace that thou wilt never discover it to any one, save to him of whom\r\nI shall tell thee, and after that thou wilt help me in that which\r\nlieth in thy power; and of this I pray thee Thou must know, then,\r\nMinuccio mine, that the day our lord King Pedro held the great\r\nfestival in honour of his exaltation to the throne, it befell me, as\r\nhe tilted, to espy him at so dour a point[459] that for the love of\r\nhim there was kindled in my heart a fire that hath brought me to this\r\npass wherein thou seest me, and knowing how ill my love beseemeth to a\r\nking, yet availing not, let alone to drive it away, but even to abate\r\nit, and it being beyond measure grievous to me to bear, I have as a\r\nlesser evil elected to die, as I shall do. True it is that I should\r\nbegone hence cruelly disconsolate, an he first knew it not; wherefore,\r\nunknowing by whom I could more aptly acquaint him with this my\r\nresolution than by thyself, I desire to commit it to thee and pray\r\nthee that thou refuse not to do it, and whenas thou shalt have done\r\nit, that thou give me to know thereof, so that, dying comforted, I may\r\nbe assoiled of these my pains.' And this said, she stinted, weeping.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 459: _In si forte punto_, or, in modern parlance, at so\r\ncritical or ill-starred a moment.]\r\n\r\nMinuccio marvelled at the greatness of the damsel's soul and at her\r\ncruel resolve and was sore concerned for her; then, it suddenly\r\noccurring to his mind how he might honourably oblige her, he said to\r\nher, 'Lisa, I pledge thee my faith, whereof thou mayst live assured\r\nthat thou wilt never find thyself deceived, and after, commending thee\r\nof so high an emprise as it is to have set thy mind upon so great a\r\nking, I proffer thee mine aid, by means whereof I hope, an thou wilt\r\nbut take comfort, so to do that, ere three days be past, I doubt not\r\nto bring thee news that will be exceeding grateful to thee; and to\r\nlose no time, I mean to go about it forthright.' Lisa, having anew\r\nbesought him amain thereof and promised him to take comfort, bade him\r\nGod speed; whereupon Minuccio, taking his leave, betook himself to one\r\nMico da Siena, a mighty good rhymer of those days, and constrained him\r\nwith prayers to make the following canzonet:\r\n\r\n     Bestir thee, Love, and get thee to my Sire\r\n       And tell him all the torments I aby;\r\n       Tell him I'm like to die,\r\n     For fearfulness concealing my desire.\r\n\r\n     Love, with clasped hands I cry thee mercy, so\r\n       Thou mayst betake thee where my lord doth dwell.\r\n     Say that I love and long for him, for lo,\r\n       My heart he hath inflamed so sadly well;\r\n     Yea, for the fire wherewith I'm all aglow,\r\n       I fear to die nor yet the hour can tell\r\n       When I shall part from pain so fierce and fell\r\n         As that which, longing, for his sake I dree\r\n         In shame and fear; ah me,\r\n     For God's sake, cause him know my torment dire.\r\n\r\n     Since first enamoured, Love, of him I grew,\r\n       Thou hast not given me the heart to dare\r\n     So much as one poor once my lord unto\r\n       My love and longing plainly to declare,\r\n     My lord who maketh me so sore to rue;\r\n       Death, dying thus, were hard to me to bear.\r\n       Belike, indeed, for he is debonair,\r\n         'Twould not displease him, did he know what pain\r\n         I feel and didst thou deign\r\n     Me daring to make known to him my fire.\r\n\r\n     Yet, since 'twas not thy pleasure to impart,\r\n       Love, such assurance to me that by glance\r\n     Or sign or writ I might make known my heart\r\n       Unto my lord, for my deliverance\r\n     I prithee, sweet my master, of thine art\r\n       Get thee to him and give him souvenance\r\n       Of that fair day I saw him shield and lance\r\n         Bear with the other knights and looking more,\r\n         Enamoured fell so sore\r\n     My heart thereof doth perish and expire.\r\n\r\nThese words Minuccio forthwith set to a soft and plaintive air, such\r\nas the matter thereof required, and on the third day he betook himself\r\nto court, where, King Pedro being yet at meat, he was bidden by him\r\nsing somewhat to his viol. Thereupon he fell to singing the song\r\naforesaid on such dulcet wise that all who were in the royal hall\r\nappeared men astonied, so still and attent stood they all to hearken,\r\nand the king maybe more than the others. Minuccio having made an end\r\nof his singing, the king enquired whence came this song that himseemed\r\nhe had never before heard. 'My lord,' replied the minstrel, 'it is not\r\nyet three days since the words were made and the air.' The king asked\r\nfor whom it had been made; and Minuccio answered, 'I dare not discover\r\nit save to you alone.' The king, desirous to hear it, as soon as the\r\ntables were removed, sent for Minuccio into his chamber and the latter\r\norderly recounted to him all that he had heard from Lisa; wherewith\r\nDon Pedro was exceeding well pleased and much commended the damsel,\r\navouching himself resolved to have compassion of so worthful a young\r\nlady and bidding him therefore go comfort her on his part and tell her\r\nthat he would without fail come to visit her that day towards vespers.\r\nMinuccio, overjoyed to be the bearer of such pleasing news, betook\r\nhimself incontinent, viol and all, to the damsel and bespeaking her in\r\nprivate, recounted to her all that had passed and after sang her the\r\nsong to his viol; whereat she was so rejoiced and so content that she\r\nstraightway showed manifest signs of great amendment and longingly\r\nawaited the hour of vespers, whenas her lord should come, without any\r\nof the household knowing or guessing how the case stood.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the king, who was a debonair and generous prince, having\r\nsundry times taken thought to the things heard from Minuccio and very\r\nwell knowing the damsel and her beauty, waxed yet more pitiful over\r\nher and mounting to horse towards vespers, under colour of going\r\nabroad for his diversion, betook himself to the apothecary's house,\r\nwhere, having required a very goodly garden which he had to be opened\r\nto him, he alighted therein and presently asked Bernardo what was come\r\nof his daughter and if he had yet married her. 'My lord,' replied the\r\napothecary, 'she is not married; nay, she hath been and is yet very\r\nsick; albeit it is true that since none she hath mended marvellously.'\r\nThe king readily apprehended what this amendment meant and said, 'In\r\ngood sooth, 'twere pity so fair a creature should be yet taken from\r\nthe world. We would fain go visit her.' Accordingly, a little after,\r\nhe betook himself with Bernardo and two companions only to her chamber\r\nand going up to the bed where the damsel, somedele upraised,[460]\r\nawaited him with impatience, took her by the hand and said to her,\r\n'What meaneth this, my mistress? You are young and should comfort\r\nother women; yet you suffer yourself to be sick. We would beseech you\r\nbe pleased, for the love of us, to hearten yourself on such wise that\r\nyou may speedily be whole again.' The damsel, feeling herself touched\r\nof his hands whom she loved over all else, albeit she was somewhat\r\nshamefast, felt yet such gladness in her heart as she were in Paradise\r\nand answered him, as best she might, saying, 'My lord, my having\r\nwilled to subject my little strength unto very grievous burdens hath\r\nbeen the cause to me of this mine infirmity, whereof, thanks to your\r\ngoodness, you shall soon see me quit.' The king alone understood the\r\ndamsel's covert speech and held her momently of more account; nay,\r\nsundry whiles he inwardly cursed fortune, who had made her daughter\r\nunto such a man; then, after he had tarried with her awhile and\r\ncomforted her yet more, he took his leave.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 460: _Sollevata_, syn. solaced, relieved or (3) agitated,\r\ntroubled.]\r\n\r\nThis humanity of the king was greatly commended and attributed for\r\ngreat honour to the apothecary and his daughter, which latter abode as\r\nwell pleased as ever was woman of her lover, and sustained of better\r\nhope, in a few days recovered and became fairer than ever. When she\r\nwas whole again, the king, having taken counsel with the queen of what\r\nreturn he should make her for so much love, mounting one day to horse\r\nwith many of his barons, repaired to the apothecary's house and\r\nentering the garden, let call Master Bernardo and his daughter; then,\r\nthe queen presently coming thither with many ladies and having\r\nreceived Lisa among them, they fell to making wonder-merry. After a\r\nwhile, the king and queen called Lisa to them and the former said to\r\nher, 'Noble damsel, the much love you have borne us hath gotten you a\r\ngreat honour from us, wherewith we would have you for the love of us\r\nbe content; to wit, that, since you are apt for marriage, we would\r\nhave you take him to husband whom we shall bestow on you, purposing,\r\nnotwithstanding this, to call ourselves still your knight, without\r\ndesiring aught from you of so much love but one sole kiss.' The\r\ndamsel, grown all vermeil in the face for shamefastness, making the\r\nking's pleasure hers, replied in a low voice on this wise, 'My lord, I\r\nam well assured that, were it known that I had fallen enamoured of\r\nyou, most folk would account me mad therefor, thinking belike that I\r\nhad forgotten myself and knew not mine own condition nor yet yours;\r\nbut God, who alone seeth the hearts of mortals, knoweth that, in that\r\nsame hour whenas first you pleased me, I knew you for a king and\r\nmyself for the daughter of Bernardo the apothecary and that it ill\r\nbeseemed me to address the ardour of my soul unto so high a place.\r\nBut, as you know far better than I, none here below falleth in love\r\naccording to fitness of election, but according to appetite and\r\ninclination, against which law I once and again strove with all my\r\nmight, till, availing no farther, I loved and love and shall ever\r\nlove you. But, since first I felt myself taken with love of you, I\r\ndetermined still to make your will mine; wherefore, not only will I\r\ngladly obey you in this matter of taking a husband at your hands and\r\nholding him dear whom it shall please you to bestow on me, since that\r\nwill be mine honour and estate, but, should you bid me abide in the\r\nfire, it were a delight to me, an I thought thereby to pleasure you.\r\nTo have you, a king, to knight, you know how far it befitteth me,\r\nwherefore to that I make no farther answer; nor shall the kiss be\r\nvouchsafed you, which alone of my love you would have, without leave\r\nof my lady the queen. Natheless, of such graciousness as hath been\r\nyours towards me and that of our lady the queen here God render you\r\nfor me both thanks and recompense, for I have not the wherewithal.'\r\nAnd with that she was silent.\r\n\r\nHer answer much pleased the queen and she seemed to her as discreet as\r\nthe king had reported her. Don Pedro then let call the girl's father\r\nand mother and finding that they were well pleased with that which he\r\npurposed to do, summoned a young man, by name Perdicone, who was of\r\ngentle birth, but poor, and giving certain rings into his hand,\r\nmarried him, nothing loath, to Lisa; which done, he then and there,\r\nover and above many and precious jewels bestowed by the queen and\r\nhimself upon the damsel, gave him Ceffalu and Calatabellotta, two very\r\nrich and goodly fiefs, and said to him, 'These we give thee to the\r\nlady's dowry. That which we purpose to do for thyself, thou shalt see\r\nin time to come.' This said, he turned to the damsel and saying, 'Now\r\nwill we take that fruit which we are to have of your love,' took her\r\nhead in his hands and kissed her on the brow. Perdicone and Lisa's\r\nfather and mother, well pleased, (as indeed was she herself,) held\r\nhigh festival and joyous nuptials; and according as many avouch, the\r\nking very faithfully kept his covenant with the damsel, for that,\r\nwhilst she lived, he still styled himself her knight nor ever went\r\nabout any deed of arms but he wore none other favour than that which\r\nwas sent him of her. It is by doing, then, on this wise that subjects'\r\nhearts are gained, that others are incited to do well and that eternal\r\nrenown is acquired; but this is a mark at which few or none nowadays\r\nbend the bow of their understanding, most princes being presently\r\ngrown cruel and tyrannical.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Tenth]\r\n\r\n     SOPHRONIA, THINKING TO MARRY GISIPPUS, BECOMETH THE WIFE OF\r\n     TITUS QUINTIUS FULVUS AND WITH HIM BETAKETH HERSELF TO ROME,\r\n     WHITHER GISIPPUS COMETH IN POOR CASE AND CONCEIVING HIMSELF\r\n     SLIGHTED OF TITUS, DECLARETH, SO HE MAY DIE, TO HAVE SLAIN A\r\n     MAN. TITUS, RECOGNIZING HIM, TO SAVE HIM, AVOUCHETH HIMSELF\r\n     TO HAVE DONE THE DEED, AND THE TRUE MURDERER, SEEING THIS,\r\n     DISCOVERETH HIMSELF; WHEREUPON THEY ARE ALL THREE LIBERATED\r\n     BY OCTAVIANUS AND TITUS, GIVING GISIPPUS HIS SISTER TO WIFE,\r\n     HATH ALL HIS GOOD IN COMMON WITH HIM\r\n\r\n\r\nPampinea having left speaking and all having commended King Pedro, the\r\nGhibelline lady more than the rest, Fiammetta, by the king's\r\ncommandment, began thus, \"Illustrious ladies, who is there knoweth not\r\nthat kings, when they will, can do everything great and that it is, to\r\nboot, especially required of them that they be magnificent? Whoso,\r\nthen, having the power, doth that which pertaineth unto him, doth\r\nwell; but folk should not so much marvel thereat nor exalt him to such\r\na height with supreme praise as it would behove them do with another,\r\nof whom, for lack of means, less were required. Wherefore, if you with\r\nsuch words extol the actions of kings and they seem to you fair, I\r\ndoubt not anywise but those of our peers, whenas they are like unto or\r\ngreater than those of kings, will please you yet more and be yet\r\nhighlier commended of you, and I purpose accordingly to recount to\r\nyou, in a story, the praiseworthy and magnanimous dealings of two\r\ncitizens and friends with each other.\r\n\r\nYou must know, then, that at the time when Octavianus Cæsar (not yet\r\nstyled Augustus) ruled the Roman empire in the office called\r\nTriumvirate, there was in Rome a gentleman called Publius Quintius\r\nFulvus,[461] who, having a son of marvellous understanding, by name\r\nTitus Quintius Fulvus, sent him to Athens to study philosophy and\r\ncommended him as most he might to a nobleman there called Chremes, his\r\nvery old friend, by whom Titus was lodged in his own house, in company\r\nof a son of his called Gisippus, and set to study with the latter,\r\nunder the governance of a philosopher named Aristippus. The two young\r\nmen, coming to consort together, found each other's usances so\r\nconformable that there was born thereof a brotherhood between them and\r\na friendship so great that it was never sundered by other accident\r\nthan death, and neither of them knew weal nor peace save in so much as\r\nthey were together. Entering upon their studies and being each alike\r\nendowed with the highest understanding, they ascended with equal step\r\nand marvellous commendation to the glorious altitudes of philosophy;\r\nand in this way of life they continued good three years, to the\r\nexceeding contentment of Chremes, who in a manner looked upon the one\r\nas no more his son than the other. At the end of this time it befell,\r\neven as it befalleth of all things, that Chremes, now an old man,\r\ndeparted this life, whereof the two young men suffered a like sorrow,\r\nas for a common father, nor could his friends and kinsfolk discern\r\nwhich of the twain was the more in need of consolation for that which\r\nhad betided them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 461: Sic, _Publio Quinzio Fulvo_; but _quære_ should it not\r\nrather be _Publio Quinto Fulvio_, _i.e._ Publius Quintus Fulvius, a\r\nform of the name which seems more in accordance with the genius of the\r\nLatin language?]\r\n\r\nIt came to pass, after some months, that the friends and kinsfolk of\r\nGisippus resorted to him and together with Titus exhorted him to take\r\na wife, to which he consenting, they found him a young Athenian lady\r\nof marvellous beauty and very noble parentage, whose name was\r\nSophronia and who was maybe fifteen years old. The term of the future\r\nnuptials drawing nigh, Gisippus one day besought Titus to go visit her\r\nwith him, for that he had not yet seen her. Accordingly, they being\r\ncome into her house and she seated between the twain, Titus proceeded\r\nto consider her with the utmost attention, as if to judge of the\r\nbeauty of his friend's bride, and every part of her pleasing him\r\nbeyond measure, what while he inwardly commended her charms to the\r\nutmost, he fell, without showing any sign thereof, as passionately\r\nenamoured of her as ever yet man of woman. After they had been with\r\nher awhile, they took their leave and returned home, where Titus,\r\nbetaking himself alone into his chamber, fell a-thinking of the\r\ncharming damsel and grew the more enkindled the more he enlarged upon\r\nher in thought; which, perceiving, he fell to saying in himself, after\r\nmany ardent sighs, 'Alack, the wretchedness of thy life, Titus! Where\r\nand on what settest thou thy mind and thy love and thy hope? Knowest\r\nthou not that it behoveth thee, as well for the kindness received from\r\nChremes and his family as for the entire friendship that is between\r\nthee and Gisippus, whose bride she is, to have yonder damsel in such\r\nrespect as a sister? Whom, then, lovest thou? Whither lettest thou\r\nthyself be carried away by delusive love, whither by fallacious hope?\r\nOpen the eyes of thine understanding and recollect thyself, wretch\r\nthat thou art; give place to reason, curb thy carnal appetite, temper\r\nthine unhallowed desires and direct thy thoughts unto otherwhat;\r\ngainstand thy lust in this its beginning and conquer thyself, whilst\r\nit is yet time. This thou wouldst have is unseemly, nay, it is\r\ndishonourable; this thou art minded to ensue it behoveth thee, even\r\nwert thou assured (which thou art not) of obtaining it, to flee from,\r\nan thou have regard unto that which true friendship requireth and that\r\nwhich thou oughtest. What, then, wilt thou do, Titus? Thou wilt leave\r\nthis unseemly love, an thou wouldst do that which behoveth.'\r\n\r\nThen, remembering him of Sophronia and going over to the contrary, he\r\ndenounced all that he had said, saying, 'The laws of love are of\r\ngreater puissance than any others; they annul even the Divine laws,\r\nlet alone those of friendship; how often aforetime hath father loved\r\ndaughter, brother sister, stepmother stepson, things more monstrous\r\nthan for one friend to love the other's wife, the which hath already a\r\nthousand times befallen! Moreover, I am young and youth is altogether\r\nsubject to the laws of Love; wherefor that which pleaseth Him, needs\r\nmust it please me. Things honourable pertain unto maturer folk; I can\r\nwill nought save that which Love willeth. The beauty of yonder damsel\r\ndeserveth to be loved of all, and if I love her, who am young, who can\r\njustly blame me therefor? I love her not because she is Gisippus's;\r\nnay, I love her for that I should love her, whosesoever she was. In\r\nthis fortune sinneth that hath allotted her to Gisippus my friend,\r\nrather than to another; and if she must be loved, (as she must, and\r\ndeservedly, for her beauty,) Gisippus, an he came to know it, should\r\nbe better pleased that I should love her, I, than another.' Then, from\r\nthat reasoning he reverted again to the contrary, making mock of\r\nhimself, and wasted not only that day and the ensuing night in passing\r\nfrom this to that and back again, but many others, insomuch that,\r\nlosing appetite and sleep therefor, he was constrained for weakness to\r\ntake to his bed.\r\n\r\nGisippus, having beheld him several days full of melancholy thought\r\nand seeing him presently sick, was sore concerned and with every art\r\nand all solicitude studied to comfort him, never leaving him and\r\nquestioning him often and instantly of the cause of his melancholy and\r\nhis sickness. Titus, after having once and again given him idle tales,\r\nwhich Gisippus knew to be such, by way of answer, finding himself e'en\r\nconstrained thereunto, with tears and sighs replied to him on this\r\nwise, 'Gisippus, had it pleased the Gods, death were far more a-gree\r\nto me than to live longer, considering that fortune hath brought me to\r\na pass whereas it behoved me make proof of my virtue and that I have,\r\nto my exceeding shame, found this latter overcome; but certes I look\r\nthereof to have ere long the reward that befitteth me, to wit, death,\r\nand this will be more pleasing to me than to live in remembrance of my\r\nbaseness, which latter, for that I cannot nor should hide aught from\r\nthee, I will, not without sore blushing, discover to thee.' Then,\r\nbeginning from the beginning, he discovered to him the cause of his\r\nmelancholy and the conflict of his thoughts and ultimately gave him to\r\nknow which had gotten the victory and confessed himself perishing for\r\nlove of Sophronia, declaring that, knowing how much this misbeseemed\r\nhim, he had for penance thereof resolved himself to die, whereof he\r\ntrusted speedily to make an end.\r\n\r\nGisippus, hearing this and seeing his tears, abode awhile irresolute,\r\nas one who, though more moderately, was himself taken with the charms\r\nof the fair damsel, but speedily bethought himself that his friend's\r\nlife should be dearer to him than Sophronia. Accordingly, solicited to\r\ntears by those of his friend, he answered him, weeping, 'Titus, wert\r\nthou not in need as thou art of comfort, I should complain of thee to\r\nthyself, as of one who hath transgressed against our friendship in\r\nhaving so long kept thy most grievous passion hidden from me; since,\r\nalbeit it appeared not to thee honourable, nevertheless dishonourable\r\nthings should not, more than honourable, be hidden from a friend; for\r\nthat a friend, like as he rejoiceth with his friend in honourable\r\nthings, even so he studieth to do away the dishonourable from his\r\nfriend's mind; but for the present I will refrain therefrom and come\r\nto that which I perceive to be of greater urgency. That thou lovest\r\nSophronia, who is betrothed to me, I marvel not: nay, I should\r\nmarvel, indeed, if it were not so, knowing her beauty and the nobility\r\nof thy mind, so much the more susceptible of passion as the thing that\r\npleaseth hath the more excellence. And the more reason thou hast to\r\nlove Sophronia, so much the more unjustly dost thou complain of\r\nfortune (albeit thou expressest this not in so many words) in that it\r\nhath awarded her to me, it seeming to thee that thy love for her had\r\nbeen honourable, were she other than mine; but tell me, if thou be as\r\nwell advised as thou usest to be, to whom could fortune have awarded\r\nher, whereof thou shouldst have more cause to render it thanks, than\r\nof having awarded her to me? Whoso else had had her, how honourable\r\nsoever thy love had been, had liefer loved her for himself[462] than\r\nfor thee,[463] a thing which thou shouldst not fear[464] from me, an\r\nthou hold me a friend such as I am to thee, for that I mind me not,\r\nsince we have been friends, to have ever had aught that was not as\r\nmuch thine as mine. Now, were the matter so far advanced that it might\r\nnot be otherwise, I would do with her as I have done with my other\r\npossessions;[465] but it is yet at such a point that I can make her\r\nthine alone; and I will do so, for that I know not why my friendship\r\nshould be dear to thee, if, in respect of a thing that may honourably\r\nbe done, I knew not of a desire of mine to make thine. True it is that\r\nSophronia is my promised bride and that I loved her much and looked\r\nwith great joyance for my nuptials with her; but, since thou, being\r\nfar more understanding than I, with more ardour desirest so dear a\r\nthing as she is, live assured that she shall enter my chamber, not as\r\nmy wife, but as thine. Wherefore leave thought-taking, put away\r\nmelancholy, call back thy lost health and comfort and allegresse and\r\nfrom this time forth expect with blitheness the reward of thy love,\r\nfar worthier than was mine.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 462: Or \"his\" (_a sè_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 463: Or \"thine\" (_a te_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 464: Lit. \"hope\" (_sperare_). See note, p. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 465: _i.e._ I would have her in common with thee.]\r\n\r\nWhen Titus heard Gisippus speak thus, the more the flattering hopes\r\ngiven him of the latter afforded him pleasure, so much the more did\r\njust reason inform him with shame, showing him that, the greater was\r\nGisippus his liberality, the more unworthy it appeared of himself to\r\nuse it; wherefore, without giving over weeping, he with difficulty\r\nreplied to him thus, 'Gisippus, thy generous and true friendship very\r\nplainly showeth me that which it pertaineth unto mine to do. God\r\nforfend that her, whom He hath bestowed upon thee as upon the\r\nworthier, I should receive from thee for mine! Had He judged it\r\nfitting that she should be mine, nor thou nor others can believe that\r\nHe would ever have bestowed her on thee. Use, therefore, joyfully,\r\nthine election and discreet counsel and His gifts, and leave me to\r\nlanguish in the tears, which, as to one undeserving of such a\r\ntreasure, He hath prepared unto me and which I will either overcome,\r\nand that will be dear to thee, or they will overcome me and I shall be\r\nout of pain.' 'Titus,' rejoined Gisippus, 'an our friendship might\r\naccord me such license that I should enforce thee to ensue a desire of\r\nmine and if it may avail to induce thee to do so, it is in this case\r\nthat I mean to use it to the utmost, and if thou yield not to my\r\nprayers with a good grace, I will, with such violence as it behoveth\r\nus use for the weal of our friends, procure that Sophronia shall be\r\nthine. I know how great is the might of love and that, not once, but\r\nmany a time, it hath brought lovers to a miserable death; nay, unto\r\nthis I see thee so near that thou canst neither turn back nor avail to\r\nmaster thy tears, but, proceeding thus, wouldst pine and die;\r\nwhereupon I, without any doubt, should speedily follow after. If,\r\nthen, I loved thee not for otherwhat, thy life is dear to me, so I\r\nmyself may live. Sophronia, therefore, shall be thine, for that thou\r\ncouldst not lightly find another woman who would so please thee, and\r\nas I shall easily turn my love unto another, I shall thus have\r\ncontented both thyself and me. I should not, peradventure, be so free\r\nto do this, were wives as scarce and as uneath to find as friends;\r\nhowever, as I can very easily find me another wife, but not another\r\nfriend, I had liefer (I will not say _lose_ her, for that I shall not\r\nlose her, giving her to thee, but shall transfer her to another and a\r\nbetter self, but) transfer her than lose thee. Wherefore, if my\r\nprayers avail aught with thee, I beseech thee put away from thee this\r\naffliction and comforting at once thyself and me, address thee with\r\ngood hope to take that joyance which thy fervent love desireth of the\r\nthing beloved.'\r\n\r\nAlthough Titus was ashamed to consent to this, namely, that Sophronia\r\nshould become his wife, and on this account held out yet awhile,\r\nnevertheless, love on the one hand drawing him and Gisippus his\r\nexhortations on the other urging him, he said, 'Look you, Gisippus, I\r\nknow not which I can say I do most, my pleasure or thine, in doing\r\nthat whereof thou prayest me and which thou tellest me is so pleasing\r\nto thee, and since thy generosity is such that it overcometh my just\r\nshame, I will e'en do it; but of this thou mayst be assured that I do\r\nit as one who knoweth himself to receive of thee, not only the beloved\r\nlady, but with her his life. The Gods grant, an it be possible, that I\r\nmay yet be able to show thee, for thine honour and thy weal, how\r\ngrateful to me is that which thou, more pitiful for me than I for\r\nmyself, dost for me!' These things said, 'Titus,' quoth Gisippus, 'in\r\nthis matter, an we would have it take effect, meseemeth this course is\r\nto be held. As thou knowest, Sophronia, after long treaty between my\r\nkinsfolk and hers, is become my affianced bride; wherefore, should I\r\nnow go about to say that I will not have her to wife, a sore scandal\r\nwould ensue thereof and I should anger both her kinsfolk and mine own.\r\nOf this, indeed, I should reck nothing, an I saw that she was thereby\r\nto become thine; but I misdoubt me that, an I renounce her at this\r\npoint, her kinsfolk will straightway give her to another, who belike\r\nwill not be thyself, and so wilt thou have lost that which I shall not\r\nhave gained. Wherefore meseemeth well, an thou be content, that I\r\nfollow on with that which I have begun and bring her home as mine and\r\nhold the nuptials, and thou mayst after, as we shall know how to\r\ncontrive, privily lie with her as with thy wife. Then, in due place\r\nand season, we will make manifest the fact, which, if it please them\r\nnot, will still be done and they must perforce be content, being\r\nunable to go back upon it.'\r\n\r\nThe device pleased Titus; wherefore Gisippus received the lady into\r\nhis house, as his, (Titus being by this recovered and in good case,)\r\nand after holding high festival, the night being come, the ladies left\r\nthe new-married wife in her husband's bed and went their ways. Now\r\nTitus his chamber adjoined that of Gisippus and one might go from the\r\none room into the other; wherefore Gisippus, being in his chamber and\r\nhaving put out all the lights, betook himself stealthily to his friend\r\nand bade him go couch with his mistress. Titus, seeing this, was\r\novercome with shame and would fain have repented and refused to go;\r\nbut Gisippus, who with his whole heart, no less than in words, was\r\nminded to do his friend's pleasure, sent him thither, after long\r\ncontention. Whenas he came into the bed, he took the damsel in his\r\narms and asked her softly, as if in sport, if she chose to be his\r\nwife. She, thinking him to be Gisippus, answered, 'Yes'; whereupon he\r\nset a goodly and rich ring on her finger, saying, 'And I choose to be\r\nthy husband.' Then, the marriage consummated, he took long and amorous\r\npleasance of her, without her or others anywise perceiving that other\r\nthan Gisippus lay with her.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of Sophronia and Titus being at this pass, Publius his\r\nfather departed this life, wherefore it was written him that he should\r\nwithout delay return to Rome, to look to his affairs, and he\r\naccordingly took counsel with Gisippus to betake himself thither and\r\ncarry Sophronia with him; which might not nor should aptly be done\r\nwithout discovering to her how the case stood. Accordingly, one day,\r\ncalling her into the chamber, they thoroughly discovered to her the\r\nfact and thereof Titus certified her by many particulars of that which\r\nhad passed between them twain. Sophronia, after eying the one and the\r\nother somewhat despitefully, fell a-weeping bitterly, complaining of\r\nGisippus his deceit; then, rather than make any words of this in his\r\nhouse, she repaired to that of her father and there acquainted him and\r\nher mother with the cheat that had been put upon her and them by\r\nGisippus, avouching herself to be the wife of Titus and not of\r\nGisippus, as they believed. This was exceeding grievous to Sophronia's\r\nfather, who made long and sore complaint thereof to her kinsfolk and\r\nthose of Gisippus, and much and great was the talk and the clamour by\r\nreason thereof. Gisippus was held in despite both by his own kindred\r\nand those of Sophronia and every one declared him worthy not only of\r\nblame, but of severe chastisement; whilst he, on the contrary,\r\navouched himself to have done an honourable thing and one for which\r\nthanks should be rendered him by Sophronia's kinsfolk, having married\r\nher to a better than himself.\r\n\r\nTitus, on his part, heard and suffered everything with no little annoy\r\nand knowing it to be the usance of the Greeks to press on with\r\nclamours and menaces, till such times as they found who should answer\r\nthem, and then to become not only humble, but abject, he bethought\r\nhimself that their clamour was no longer to be brooked without reply\r\nand having a Roman spirit and an Athenian wit, he adroitly contrived\r\nto assemble Gisippus his kinsfolk and those of Sophronia in a temple,\r\nwherein entering, accompanied by Gisippus alone, he thus bespoke the\r\nexpectant folk: 'It is the belief of many philosophers that the\r\nactions of mortals are determined and foreordained of the immortal\r\nGods, wherefore some will have it that all that is or shall ever be\r\ndone is of necessity, albeit there be others who attribute this\r\nnecessity to that only which is already done. If these opinions be\r\nconsidered with any diligence, it will very manifestly be seen that to\r\nblame a thing which cannot be undone is to do no otherwhat than to\r\nseek to show oneself wiser than the Gods, who, we must e'en believe,\r\ndispose of and govern us and our affairs with unfailing wisdom and\r\nwithout any error; wherefore you may very easily see what fond and\r\nbrutish overweening it is to presume to find fault with their\r\noperations and eke how many and what chains they merit who suffer\r\nthemselves be so far carried away by hardihood as to do this. Of whom,\r\nto my thinking, you are all, if that be true which I understand you\r\nhave said and still say for that Sophronia is become my wife, whereas\r\nyou had given her to Gisippus, never considering that it was\r\nforeordained from all eternity that she should become not his, but\r\nmine, as by the issue is known at this present. But, for that to speak\r\nof the secret foreordinance and intention of the Gods appeareth unto\r\nmany a hard thing and a grievous to apprehend, I am willing to suppose\r\nthat they concern not themselves with aught of our affairs and to\r\ncondescend to the counsels[466] of mankind, in speaking whereof, it\r\nwill behove me to do two things, both very contrary to my usances, the\r\none, somedele to commend myself, and the other, in some measure to\r\nblame or disparage others; but, for that I purpose, neither in the one\r\nnor in the other, to depart from the truth and that the present matter\r\nrequireth it, I will e'en do it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 466: Or \"arguments\" (_consigli_).]\r\n\r\nYour complainings, dictated more by rage than by reason, upbraid,\r\nrevile and condemn Gisippus with continual murmurs or rather clamours,\r\nfor that, of his counsel, he hath given me to wife her whom you of\r\nyours[467] had given him; whereas I hold that he is supremely to be\r\ncommended therefor, and that for two reasons, the one, for that he\r\nhath done that which a friend should do, and the other, for that he\r\nhath in this wrought more discreetly than did you. That which the\r\nsacred laws of friendship will that one friend should do for the\r\nother, it is not my intention at this present to expound, being\r\ncontent to have recalled to you this much only thereof, to wit, that\r\nthe bonds of friendship are far more stringent than those of blood or\r\nof kindred, seeing that the friends we have are such as we choose for\r\nourselves and our kinsfolk such as fortune giveth us; wherefore, if\r\nGisippus loved my life more than your goodwill, I being his friend, as\r\nI hold myself, none should marvel thereat. But to come to the second\r\nreason, whereanent it more instantly behoveth to show you that he hath\r\nbeen wiser than yourselves, since meseemeth you reck nothing of the\r\nforeordinance of the Gods and know yet less of the effects of\r\nfriendship:--I say, then, that you of your judgment, of your counsel\r\nand of your deliberation, gave Sophronia to Gisippus, a young man and\r\na philosopher; Gisippus of his gave her to a young man and a\r\nphilosopher; your counsel gave her to an Athenian and that of Gisippus\r\nto a Roman; your counsel gave her to a youth of noble birth and his to\r\none yet nobler; yours to a rich youth, his to a very rich; yours to a\r\nyouth who not only loved her not, but scarce knew her, his to one who\r\nloved her over his every happiness and more than his very life. And to\r\nshow you that this I say is true and that Gisippus his action is more\r\ncommendable than yours, let us consider it, part by part. That I, like\r\nGisippus, am a young man and a philosopher, my favour and my studies\r\nmay declare, without more discourse thereof. One same age is his and\r\nmine and still with equal step have we proceeded studying. True, he is\r\nan Athenian and I am a Roman. If it be disputed of the glory of our\r\nnative cities, I say that I am a citizen of a free city and he of a\r\ntributary one; I am of a city mistress of the whole world and he of a\r\ncity obedient unto mine; I am of a city most illustrious in arms, in\r\nempery and in letters, whereas he can only commend his own for\r\nletters. Moreover, albeit you see me here on lowly wise enough a\r\nstudent, I am not born of the dregs of the Roman populace; my houses\r\nand the public places of Rome are full of antique images of my\r\nancestors and the Roman annals will be found full of many a triumph\r\nled by the Quintii up to the Roman Capitol; nor is the glory of our\r\nname fallen for age into decay, nay, it presently flourisheth more\r\nsplendidly than ever. I speak not, for shamefastness, of my riches,\r\nbearing in mind that honourable poverty hath ever been the ancient and\r\nmost ample patrimony of the noble citizens of Rome; but, if this be\r\ncondemned of the opinion of the vulgar and treasures commended, I am\r\nabundantly provided with these latter, not as one covetous, but as\r\nbeloved of fortune.[468] I know very well that it was and should have\r\nbeen and should be dear unto you to have Gisippus here in Athens to\r\nkinsman; but I ought not for any reason to be less dear to you at\r\nRome, considering that in me you would have there an excellent host\r\nand an useful and diligent and powerful patron, no less in public\r\noccasions than in matters of private need.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 467: _i.e._ of your counsel.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 468: _i.e._ my riches are not the result of covetous\r\namassing, but of the favours of fortune.]\r\n\r\nWho then, letting be wilfulness and considering with reason, will\r\ncommend your counsels above those of my Gisippus? Certes, none.\r\nSophronia, then, is well and duly married to Titus Quintius Fulvus, a\r\nnoble, rich and long-descended citizen of Rome and a friend of\r\nGisippus; wherefore whoso complaineth or maketh moan of this doth not\r\nthat which he ought neither knoweth that which he doth. Some perchance\r\nwill say that they complain not of Sophronia being the wife of Titus,\r\nbut of the manner wherein she became his wife, to wit, in secret and\r\nby stealth, without friend or kinsman knowing aught thereof; but this\r\nis no marvel nor thing that betideth newly. I willingly leave be those\r\nwho have aforetime taken husbands against their parents' will and\r\nthose who have fled with their lovers and have been mistresses before\r\nthey were wives and those who have discovered themselves to be married\r\nrather by pregnancy or child-bearing than with the tongue, yet hath\r\nnecessity commended it to their kinsfolk; nothing of which hath\r\nhappened in Sophronia's case; nay, she hath orderly, discreetly and\r\nhonourably been given by Gisippus to Titus. Others will say that he\r\ngave her in marriage to whom it appertained not to do so; but these be\r\nall foolish and womanish complaints and proceed from lack of\r\nadvisement. This is not the first time that fortune hath made use of\r\nvarious means and strange instruments to bring matters to foreordained\r\nissues. What have I to care if it be a cordwainer rather than a\r\nphilosopher, that hath, according to his judgment, despatched an\r\naffair of mine, and whether in secret or openly, provided the issue be\r\ngood? If the cordwainer be indiscreet, all I have to do is to look\r\nwell that he have no more to do with my affairs and thank him for that\r\nwhich is done. If Gisippus hath married Sophronia well, it is a\r\nsuperfluous folly to go complaining of the manner and of him. If you\r\nhave no confidence in his judgment, look he have no more of your\r\ndaughters to marry and thank him for this one.\r\n\r\nNevertheless I would have you to know that I sought not, either by art\r\nor by fraud, to impose any stain upon the honour and illustriousness\r\nof your blood in the person of Sophronia, and that, albeit I took her\r\nsecretly to wife, I came not as a ravisher to rob her of her\r\nmaidenhead nor sought, after the manner of an enemy, whilst shunning\r\nyour alliance, to have her otherwise than honourably; but, being\r\nardently enkindled by her lovesome beauty and by her worth and knowing\r\nthat, had I sought her with that ordinance which you will maybe say I\r\nshould have used, I should not (she being much beloved of you) have\r\nhad her, for fear lest I should carry her off to Rome, I used the\r\noccult means that may now be discovered to you and caused Gisippus, in\r\nmy person, consent unto that which he himself was not disposed to do.\r\nMoreover, ardently as I loved her, I sought her embraces not as a\r\nlover, but as a husband, nor, as she herself can truly testify, did I\r\ndraw near to her till I had first both with the due words and with the\r\nring espoused her, asking her if she would have me for husband, to\r\nwhich she answered ay. If it appear to her that she hath been\r\ndeceived, it is not I who am to blame therefor, but she, who asked me\r\nnot who I was. This, then, is the great misdeed, the grievous crime,\r\nthe sore default committed by Gisippus as a friend and by myself as a\r\nlover, to wit, that Sophronia hath secretly become the wife of Titus\r\nQuintius, and this it is for which you defame and menace and plot\r\nagainst him. What more could you do, had he bestowed her upon a churl,\r\na losel or a slave? What chains, what prison, what gibbets had\r\nsufficed thereunto?\r\n\r\nBut let that be for the present; the time is come which I looked not\r\nfor yet, to wit, my father is dead and it behoveth me return to Rome;\r\nwherefore, meaning to carry Sophronia with me, I have discovered to\r\nyou that which I should otherwise belike have yet kept hidden from you\r\nand with which, an you be wise, you will cheerfully put up, for that,\r\nhad I wished to cheat or outrage you, I might have left her to you,\r\nscorned and dishonored; but God forfend that such a baseness should\r\never avail to harbour in a Roman breast! She, then, namely Sophronia,\r\nby the consent of the Gods and the operation of the laws of mankind,\r\nno less than by the admirable contrivance of my Gisippus and mine own\r\namorous astuteness, is become mine, and this it seemeth that you,\r\nholding yourselves belike wiser than the Gods and than the rest of\r\nmankind, brutishly condemn, showing your disapproval in two ways both\r\nexceedingly noyous to myself, first by detaining Sophronia, over whom\r\nyou have no right, save in so far as it pleaseth me to allow it, and\r\nsecondly, by entreating Gisippus, to whom you are justly beholden, as\r\nan enemy. How foolishly you do in both which things I purpose not at\r\nthis present to make farther manifest to you, but will only counsel\r\nyou, as a friend, to lay by your despites and altogether leaving your\r\nresentments and the rancours that you have conceived, to restore\r\nSophronia to me, so I may joyfully depart your kinsman and live your\r\nfriend; for of this, whether that which is done please you or please\r\nyou not, you may be assured that, if you offer to do otherwise, I will\r\ntake Gisippus from you and if I win to Rome, I will without fail,\r\nhowever ill you may take it, have her again who is justly mine and\r\never after showing myself your enemy, will cause you know by\r\nexperience that whereof the despite of Roman souls is capable.'\r\n\r\nTitus, having thus spoken, rose to his feet, with a countenance all\r\ndisordered for anger, and taking Gisippus by the hand, went forth of\r\nthe temple, shaking his head threateningly and showing that he recked\r\nlittle of as many as were there. The latter, in part reconciled by his\r\nreasonings to the alliance and desirous of his friendship and in part\r\nterrified by his last words, of one accord determined that it was\r\nbetter to have him for a kinsman, since Gisippus had not willed it,\r\nthan to have lost the latter to kinsman and gotten the former for an\r\nenemy. Accordingly, going in quest of Titus, they told him that they\r\nwere willing that Sophronia should be his and to have him for a dear\r\nkinsman and Gisippus for a dear friend; then, having mutually done\r\neach other such honours and courtesies as beseem between kinsmen and\r\nfriends, they took their leaves and sent Sophronia back to him. She,\r\nlike a wise woman, making a virtue of necessity, readily transferred\r\nto Titus the affection she bore Gisippus and repaired with him to\r\nRome, where she was received with great honour.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Gisippus abode in Athens, held in little esteem of well\r\nnigh all, and no great while after, through certain intestine\r\ntroubles, was, with all those of his house, expelled from Athens, in\r\npoverty and misery, and condemned to perpetual exile. Finding himself\r\nin this case and being grown not only poor, but beggarly, he betook\r\nhimself, as least ill he might, to Rome, to essay if Titus should\r\nremember him. There, learning that the latter was alive and high in\r\nfavour with all the Romans and enquiring for his dwelling-place, he\r\nstationed himself before the door and there abode till such time as\r\nTitus came, to whom, by reason of the wretched plight wherein he was,\r\nhe dared not say a word, but studied to cause himself be seen of him,\r\nso he might recognize him and let call him to himself; wherefore\r\nTitus passed on, [without noting him,] and Gisippus, conceiving that\r\nhe had seen and shunned him and remembering him of that which himself\r\nhad done for him aforetime, departed, despiteful and despairing. It\r\nbeing by this night and he fasting and penniless, he wandered on,\r\nunknowing whither and more desirous of death than of otherwhat, and\r\npresently happened upon a very desert part of the city, where seeing a\r\ngreat cavern, he addressed himself to abide the night there and\r\npresently, forspent with long weeping, he fell asleep on the naked\r\nearth and ill in case. To this cavern two, who had gone a-thieving\r\ntogether that night, came towards morning, with the booty they had\r\ngotten, and falling out over the division, one, who was the stronger,\r\nslew the other and went away. Gisippus had seen and heard this and\r\nhimseemed he had found a way to the death so sore desired of him,\r\nwithout slaying himself; wherefore he abode without stirring, till\r\nsuch time as the Serjeants of the watch, who had by this gotten wind\r\nof the deed, came thither and laying furious hands of him, carried him\r\noff prisoner. Gisippus, being examined, confessed that he had murdered\r\nthe man nor had since availed to depart the cavern; whereupon the\r\nprætor, who was called Marcus Varro, commanded that he should be put\r\nto death upon the cross, as the usance then was.\r\n\r\nNow Titus was by chance come at that juncture to the prætorium and\r\nlooking the wretched condemned man in the face and hearing why he had\r\nbeen doomed to die, suddenly knew him for Gisippus; whereupon,\r\nmarvelling at his sorry fortune and how he came to be in Rome and\r\ndesiring most ardently to succour him, but seeing no other means of\r\nsaving him than to accuse himself and thus excuse him, he thrust\r\nforward in haste and cried out, saying, 'Marcus Varro, call back the\r\npoor man whom thou hast condemned, for that he is innocent. I have\r\nenough offended against the Gods with one crime, in slaying him whom\r\nthine officer found this morning dead, without willing presently to\r\nwrong them with the death of another innocent.' Varro marvelled and it\r\nirked him that all the prætorium should have heard him; but, being\r\nunable, for his own honour's sake, to forbear from doing that which\r\nthe laws commanded, he caused bring back Gisippus and in the presence\r\nof Titus said to him, 'How camest thou to be so mad that, without\r\nsuffering any torture, thou confessedst to that which thou didst not,\r\nit being a capital matter? Thou declaredst thyself to be he who slew\r\nthe man yesternight, and now this man cometh and saith that it was not\r\nthou, but he that slew him.'\r\n\r\nGisippus looked and seeing that it was Titus, perceived full well that\r\nhe did this to save him, as grateful for the service aforetime\r\nreceived from him; wherefore, weeping for pity, 'Varro,' quoth he,\r\n'indeed it was I slew him and Titus his solicitude for my safety is\r\nnow too late.' Titus on the other hand, said, 'Prætor, do as thou\r\nseest, this man is a stranger and was found without arms beside the\r\nmurdered man, and thou mayst see that his wretchedness giveth him\r\noccasion to wish to die; wherefore do thou release him and punish me,\r\nwho have deserved it.' Varro marvelled at the insistence of these two\r\nand beginning now to presume that neither of them might be guilty, was\r\ncasting about for a means of acquitting them, when, behold, up came a\r\nyouth called Publius Ambustus, a man of notorious ill life and known\r\nto all the Romans for an arrant rogue, who had actually done the\r\nmurder and knowing neither of the twain to be guilty of that whereof\r\neach accused himself, such was the pity that overcame his heart for\r\nthe innocence of the two friends that, moved by supreme compassion, he\r\ncame before Varro and said, 'Prætor, my fates impel me to solve the\r\ngrievous contention of these twain and I know not what God within me\r\nspurreth and importuneth me to discover to thee my sin. Know, then,\r\nthat neither of these men is guilty of that whereof each accuseth\r\nhimself. I am verily he who slew yonder man this morning towards\r\ndaybreak and I saw this poor wretch asleep there, what while I was in\r\nact to divide the booty gotten with him whom I slew. There is no need\r\nfor me to excuse Titus; his renown is everywhere manifest and every\r\none knoweth him to be no man of such a condition. Release him,\r\ntherefore, and take of me that forfeit which the laws impose on me.'\r\n\r\nBy this Octavianus had notice of the matter and causing all three be\r\nbrought before him, desired to hear what cause had moved each of them\r\nto seek to be the condemned man. Accordingly, each related his own\r\nstory, whereupon Octavianus released the two friends, for that they\r\nwere innocent, and pardoned the other for the love of them. Thereupon\r\nTitus took his Gisippus and first reproaching him sore for\r\nlukewarmness[469] and diffidence, rejoiced in him with marvellous\r\ngreat joy and carried him to his house, where Sophronia with tears of\r\ncompassion received him as a brother. Then, having awhile recruited\r\nhim with rest and refreshment and reclothed him and restored him to\r\nsuch a habit as sorted with his worth and quality, he first shared all\r\nhis treasures and estates in common with him and after gave him to\r\nwife a young sister of his, called Fulvia, saying, 'Gisippus,\r\nhenceforth it resteth with thee whether thou wilt abide here with me\r\nor return with everything I have given thee into Achaia.' Gisippus,\r\nconstrained on the one hand by his banishment from his native land and\r\non the other by the love which he justly bore to the cherished\r\nfriendship of Titus, consented to become a Roman and accordingly took\r\nup his abode in the city, where he with his Fulvia and Titus with his\r\nSophronia lived long and happily, still abiding in one house and\r\nwaxing more friends (an more they might be) every day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 469: Sic (_tiepidezza_); but _semble_ \"timidity\" or\r\n\"distrustfulness\" is meant.]\r\n\r\nA most sacred thing, then, is friendship and worthy not only of\r\nespecial reverence, but to be commended with perpetual praise, as the\r\nmost discreet mother of magnanimity and honour, the sister of\r\ngratitude and charity and the enemy of hatred and avarice, still,\r\nwithout waiting to be entreated, ready virtuously to do unto others\r\nthat which it would have done to itself. Nowadays its divine effects\r\nare very rarely to be seen in any twain, by the fault and to the shame\r\nof the wretched cupidity of mankind, which, regarding only its own\r\nprofit, hath relegated it to perpetual exile, beyond the extremest\r\nlimits of the earth. What love, what riches, what kinship, what,\r\nexcept friendship, could have made Gisippus feel in his heart the\r\nardour, the tears and the sighs of Titus with such efficacy as to\r\ncause him yield up to his friend his betrothed bride, fair and gentle\r\nand beloved of him? What laws, what menaces, what fears could have\r\nenforced the young arms of Gisippus to abstain, in solitary places and\r\nin dark, nay, in his very bed, from the embraces of the fair damsel,\r\nshe mayhap bytimes inviting him, had friendship not done it? What\r\nhonours, what rewards, what advancements, what, indeed, but\r\nfriendship, could have made Gisippus reck not of losing his own\r\nkinsfolk and those of Sophronia nor of the unmannerly clamours of the\r\npopulace nor of scoffs and insults, so that he might pleasure his\r\nfriend? On the other hand, what, but friendship, could have prompted\r\nTitus, whenas he might fairly have feigned not to see, unhesitatingly\r\nto compass his own death, that he might deliver Gisippus from the\r\ncross to which he had of his own motion procured himself to be\r\ncondemned? What else could have made Titus, without the least demur,\r\nso liberal in sharing his most ample patrimony with Gisippus, whom\r\nfortune had bereft of his own? What else could have made him so\r\nforward to vouchsafe his sister to his friend, albeit he saw him very\r\npoor and reduced to the extreme of misery? Let men, then, covet a\r\nmultitude of comrades, troops of brethren and children galore and add,\r\nby dint of monies, to the number of their servitors, considering not\r\nthat every one of these, who and whatsoever he may be, is more fearful\r\nof every least danger of his own than careful to do away the\r\ngreat[470] from father or brother or master, whereas we see a friend\r\ndo altogether the contrary.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 470: _i.e._ perils.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NINTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Tenth]\r\n\r\n     SALADIN, IN THE DISGUISE OF A MERCHANT, IS HONOURABLY\r\n     ENTERTAINED BY MESSER TORELLO D'ISTRIA, WHO, PRESENTLY\r\n     UNDERTAKING THE [THIRD] CRUSADE, APPOINTETH HIS WIFE A TERM\r\n     FOR HER MARRYING AGAIN. HE IS TAKEN [BY THE SARACENS] AND\r\n     COMETH, BY HIS SKILL IN TRAINING HAWKS, UNDER THE NOTICE OF\r\n     THE SOLDAN, WHO KNOWETH HIM AGAIN AND DISCOVERING HIMSELF TO\r\n     HIM, ENTREATETH HIM WITH THE UTMOST HONOUR. THEN, TORELLO\r\n     FALLING SICK FOR LANGUISHMENT, HE IS BY MAGICAL ART\r\n     TRANSPORTED IN ONE NIGHT [FROM ALEXANDRIA] TO PAVIA, WHERE,\r\n     BEING RECOGNIZED BY HIS WIFE AT THE BRIDE-FEAST HELD FOR HER\r\n     MARRYING AGAIN, HE RETURNETH WITH HER TO HIS OWN HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nFilomena having made an end of her discourse and the magnificent\r\ngratitude of Titus having been of all alike commended, the king,\r\nreserving the last place unto Dioneo, proceeded to speak thus:\r\n\"Assuredly, lovesome ladies, Filomena speaketh sooth in that which she\r\nsaith of friendship and with reason complaineth, in concluding her\r\ndiscourse, of its being so little in favour with mankind. If we were\r\nhere for the purpose of correcting the defaults of the age or even of\r\nreprehending them, I might ensue her words with a discourse at large\r\nupon the subject; but, for that we aim at otherwhat, it hath occurred\r\nto my mind to set forth to you, in a story belike somewhat overlong,\r\nbut withal altogether pleasing, one of the magnificences of Saladin,\r\nto the end that, if, by reason of our defaults, the friendship of any\r\none may not be throughly acquired, we may, at the least, be led, by\r\nthe things which you shall hear in my story, to take delight in doing\r\nservice, in the hope that, whenassoever it may be, reward will ensue\r\nto us thereof.\r\n\r\nI must tell you, then, that, according to that which divers folk\r\naffirm, a general crusade was, in the days of the Emperor Frederick\r\nthe First, undertaken by the Christians for the recovery of the Holy\r\nLand, whereof Saladin, a very noble and valiant prince, who was then\r\nSoldan of Babylon, having notice awhile beforehand, he bethought\r\nhimself to seek in his own person to see the preparations of the\r\nChristian princes for the undertaking in question, so he might the\r\nbetter avail to provide himself. Accordingly, having ordered all his\r\naffairs in Egypt, he made a show of going a pilgrimage and set out in\r\nthe disguise of a merchant, attended by two only of his chiefest and\r\nsagest officers and three serving-men. After he had visited many\r\nChristian countries, it chanced that, as they rode through Lombardy,\r\nthinking to pass beyond the mountains,[471] they encountered, about\r\nvespers, on the road from Milan to Pavia, a gentleman of the latter\r\nplace, by name Messer Torello d'Istria, who was on his way, with his\r\nservants and dogs and falcons, to sojourn at a goodly country seat he\r\nhad upon the Tesino, and no sooner set eyes on Saladin and his company\r\nthan he knew them for gentlemen and strangers; wherefore, the Soldan\r\nenquiring of one of his servants how far they were yet distant from\r\nPavia and if he might win thither in time to enter the city, he\r\nsuffered not the man to reply, but himself answered, 'Gentlemen, you\r\ncannot reach Pavia in time to enter therein.' 'Then,' said Saladin,\r\n'may it please you acquaint us (for that we are strangers) where we\r\nmay best lodge the night.' Quoth Messer Torello, 'That will I\r\nwillingly do. I had it presently in mind to dispatch one of my men\r\nhere to the neighborhood of Pavia for somewhat: I will send him with\r\nyou and he shall bring you to a place where you may lodge conveniently\r\nenough.' Then, turning to the discreetest of his men he [privily]\r\nenjoined him what he should do and sent him with them, whilst he\r\nhimself, making for his country house, let order, as best he might, a\r\ngoodly supper and set the tables in the garden; which done, he posted\r\nhimself at the door to await his guests.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 471: _i.e._ to cross the Alps into France.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the servant, devising with the gentlemen of one thing and\r\nanother, led them about by certain by-roads and brought them, without\r\ntheir suspecting it, to his lord's residence, where, whenas Messer\r\nTorello saw them, he came to meet them afoot and said, smiling,\r\n'Gentlemen, you are very welcome.' Saladin, who was very quick of\r\napprehension, understood that the gentleman had misdoubted him they\r\nwould not have accepted his invitation, had he bidden them whenas he\r\nfell in with them, and had, therefore, brought them by practice to his\r\nhouse, so they might not avail to refuse to pass the night with him,\r\nand accordingly, returning his greeting, he said, 'Sir, an one could\r\ncomplain of men of courtesy, we might complain of you, for that\r\n(letting be that you have somewhat hindered us from our road) you\r\nhave, without our having merited your goodwill otherwise than by a\r\nmere salutation, constrained us to accept of such noble hospitality as\r\nis this of yours.' 'Gentlemen,' answered Messer Torello, who was a\r\ndiscreet and well-spoken man, 'it is but a sorry hospitality that you\r\nwill receive from us, regard had to that which should behove unto you,\r\nan I may judge by that which I apprehend from your carriage and that\r\nof your companions; but in truth you could nowhere out of Pavia have\r\nfound any decent place of entertainment; wherefore, let it not irk you\r\nto have gone somedele beside your way, to have a little less unease.'\r\nMeanwhile, his servants came round about the travellers and helping\r\nthem to dismount, eased[472] their horses.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 472: _Adagiarono_; see p. 447, note.]\r\n\r\nMesser Torello then brought the three stranger gentlemen to the\r\nchambers prepared for them, where he let unboot them and refresh them\r\nsomewhat with very cool wines and entertained them in agreeable\r\ndiscourse till such time as they might sup. Saladin and his companions\r\nand servants all knew Latin, wherefore they understood very well and\r\nwere understood, and it seemed to each of them that this gentleman was\r\nthe most pleasant and well-mannered man they had ever seen, ay, and\r\nthe best spoken. It appeared to Messer Torello, on the other hand,\r\nthat they were men of magnificent fashions and much more of account\r\nthan he had at first conceived, wherefore he was inwardly chagrined\r\nthat he could not honour them that evening with companions and with a\r\nmore considerable entertainment. But for this he bethought himself to\r\nmake them amends on the morrow, and accordingly, having instructed one\r\nof his servants of that which he would have done, he despatched him to\r\nPavia, which was very near at hand and where no gate was ever locked,\r\nto his lady, who was exceeding discreet and great-hearted. Then,\r\ncarrying the gentlemen into the garden, he courteously asked them who\r\nthey were, to which Saladin answered, 'We are merchants from Cyprus\r\nand are bound to Paris on our occasions.' 'Would to God,' cried Messer\r\nTorello, 'that this our country produced gentlemen of such a fashion\r\nas I see Cyprus doth merchants!' In these and other discourses they\r\nabode till it was time to sup, whereupon he left it to them to honour\r\nthemselves at table,[473] and there, for an improvised supper, they\r\nwere very well and orderly served; nor had they abidden long after the\r\ntables were removed, when Messer Torello, judging them to be weary,\r\nput them to sleep in very goodly beds and himself a little after in\r\nlike manner betook himself to rest.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 473: _i.e._ to place themselves according to their several\r\nranks, which were unknown to Torello.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the servant sent to Pavia did his errand to the lady, who,\r\nwith no womanly, but with a royal spirit, let call in haste a great\r\nnumber of the friends and servants of Messer Torello and made ready\r\nall that behoved unto a magnificent banquet. Moreover, she let bid by\r\ntorchlight many of the noblest of the townfolk to the banquet and\r\nbringing out cloths and silks and furs, caused throughly order that\r\nwhich her husband had sent to bid her do. The day come, Saladin and\r\nhis companions arose, whereupon Messer Torello took horse with them\r\nand sending for his falcons, carried them to a neighbouring ford and\r\nthere showed them how the latter flew; then, Saladin enquiring for\r\nsome one who should bring him to Pavia and to the best inn, his host\r\nsaid, 'I will be your guide, for that it behoveth me go thither.' The\r\nothers, believing this, were content and set out in company with him\r\nfor the city, which they reached about tierce and thinking to be on\r\ntheir way to the best inn, were carried by Messer Torello to his own\r\nhouse, where a good half-hundred of the most considerable citizens\r\nwere already come to receive the stranger gentlemen and were\r\nstraightway about their bridles and stirrups. Saladin and his\r\ncompanions, seeing this, understood but too well what was forward and\r\nsaid, 'Messer Torello, this is not what we asked of you; you have done\r\nenough for us this past night, ay, and far more than we are worth;\r\nwherefore you might now fitly suffer us fare on our way.' 'Gentlemen,'\r\nreplied Messer Torello, 'for my yesternight's dealing with you I am\r\nmore indebted to fortune than to you, which took you on the road at an\r\nhour when it behoved you come to my poor house; but of your this\r\nmorning's visit I shall be beholden to yourselves, and with me all\r\nthese gentlemen who are about you and to whom an it seem to you\r\ncourteous to refuse to dine with them, you can do so, if you will.'\r\n\r\nSaladin and his companions, overcome, dismounted and being joyfully\r\nreceived by the assembled company, were carried to chambers which had\r\nbeen most sumptuously arrayed for them, where having put off their\r\ntravelling gear and somewhat refreshed themselves, they repaired to\r\nthe saloon, where the banquet was splendidly prepared. Water having\r\nbeen given to the hands, they were seated at table with the goodliest\r\nand most orderly observance and magnificently served with many viands,\r\ninsomuch that, were the emperor himself come thither, it had been\r\nimpossible to do him more honour, and albeit Saladin and his\r\ncompanions were great lords and used to see very great things,\r\nnatheless, they were mightily wondered at this and it seemed to them\r\nof the greatest, having regard to the quality of the gentleman, whom\r\nthey knew to be only a citizen and not a lord. Dinner ended and the\r\ntables removed, they conversed awhile of divers things; then, at\r\nMesser Torello's instance, the heat being great, the gentlemen of\r\nPavia all betook themselves to repose, whilst he himself, abiding\r\nalone with his three guests, carried them into a chamber and (that no\r\nprecious thing of his should remain unseen of them) let call thither\r\nhis noble lady. Accordingly, the latter, who was very fair and tall of\r\nher person, came in to them, arrayed in rich apparel and flanked by\r\ntwo little sons of hers, as they were two angels, and saluted them\r\ncourteously. The strangers, seeing her, rose to their feet and\r\nreceiving her with worship, caused her sit among them and made much of\r\nher two fair children. Therewithal she entered into pleasant discourse\r\nwith them and presently, Messer Torello having gone out awhile, she\r\nasked them courteously whence they were and whither they went; to\r\nwhich they made answer even as they had done to her husband; whereupon\r\nquoth she, with a blithe air, 'Then see I that my womanly advisement\r\nwill be useful; wherefore I pray you, of your especial favour, refuse\r\nme not neither disdain a slight present, which I shall cause bring\r\nyou, but accept it, considering that women, of their little heart,\r\ngive little things and regarding more the goodwill of the giver than\r\nthe value of the gift.' Then, letting fetch them each two gowns, one\r\nlined with silk and the other with miniver, no wise citizens' clothes\r\nnor merchants, but fit for great lords to wear, and three doublets of\r\nsendal and linen breeches to match, she said, 'Take these; I have clad\r\nmy lord in gowns of the like fashion, and the other things, for all\r\nthey are little worth, may be acceptable to you, considering that you\r\nare far from your ladies and the length of the way you have travelled\r\nand that which is yet to travel and that merchants are proper men and\r\nnice of their persons.'\r\n\r\nThe Saracens marvelled and manifestly perceived that Messer Torello\r\nwas minded to leave no particular of hospitality undone them; nay,\r\nseeing the magnificence of the unmerchantlike gowns, they misdoubted\r\nthem they had been recognized of him. However, one of them made answer\r\nto the lady, saying, 'Madam, these are very great matters and such as\r\nshould not lightly be accepted, an your prayers, to which it is\r\nimpossible to say no, constrained us not thereto.' This done and\r\nMesser Torello being now returned, the lady, commending them to God,\r\ntook leave of them and let furnish their servants with like things\r\nsuch as sorted with their condition. Messer Torello with many prayers\r\nprevailed upon them to abide with him all that day; wherefore, after\r\nthey had slept awhile, they donned their gowns and rode with him\r\nsomedele about the city; then, the supper-hour come, they supped\r\nmagnificently with many worshipful companions and in due time betook\r\nthemselves to rest. On the morrow they arose with day and found, in\r\nplace of their tired hackneys, three stout and good palfreys, and on\r\nlikewise fresh and strong horses for their servants, which when\r\nSaladin saw, he turned to his companions and said, 'I vow to God that\r\nnever was there a more accomplished gentleman nor a more courteous and\r\napprehensive than this one, and if the kings of the Christians are\r\nkings of such a fashion as this is a gentleman, the Soldan of Babylon\r\ncan never hope to stand against a single one of them, not to speak of\r\nthe many whom we see make ready to fall upon him.' Then, knowing that\r\nit were in vain to seek to refuse this new gift, they very courteously\r\nthanked him therefor and mounted to horse.\r\n\r\nMesser Torello, with many companions, brought them a great way without\r\nthe city, till, grievous as it was to Saladin to part from him, (so\r\nmuch was he by this grown enamoured of him,) natheless, need\r\nconstraining him to press on, he presently besought him to turn back;\r\nwhereupon, loath as he was to leave them, 'Gentlemen,' quoth he,\r\n'since it pleaseth you, I will do it; but one thing I will e'en say to\r\nyou; I know not who you are nor do I ask to know more thereof than it\r\npleaseth you to tell me; but, be you who you may, you will never make\r\nme believe that you are merchants, and so I commend you to God.'\r\nSaladin, having by this taken leave of all Messer Torello's\r\ncompanions, replied to him, saying, 'Sir, we may yet chance to let you\r\nsee somewhat of our merchandise, whereby we may confirm your\r\nbelief;[474] meantime, God be with you.' Thereupon he departed with\r\nhis followers, firmly resolved, if life should endure to him and the\r\nwar he looked for undo him not, to do Messer Torello no less honour\r\nthan that which he had done him, and much did he discourse with his\r\ncompanions of him and of his lady and all his affairs and fashions and\r\ndealings, mightily commending everything. Then, after he had, with no\r\nlittle fatigue, visited all the West, he took ship with his companions\r\nand returned to Alexandria, where, being now fully informed, he\r\naddressed himself to his defence. As for Messer Torello, he returned\r\nto Pavia and went long in thought who these might be, but never hit\r\nupon the truth, no, nor came near it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 474: Sic (_la vostra credenza raffermeremo_); but the\r\nmeaning is, \"whereby we may amend your unbelief and give you cause to\r\ncredit our assertion that we are merchants.\"]\r\n\r\nThe time being now come for the crusade and great preparations made\r\neverywhere, Messer Torello, notwithstanding the tears and entreaties\r\nof his wife, was altogether resolved to go thereon and having made his\r\nevery provision and being about to take horse, he said to his lady,\r\nwhom he loved over all, 'Wife, as thou seest, I go on this crusade, as\r\nwell for the honour of my body as for the health of my soul. I commend\r\nto thee our affairs and our honour, and for that I am certain of the\r\ngoing, but of the returning, for a thousand chances that may betide, I\r\nhave no assurance, I will have thee do me a favour, to wit, that\r\nwhatever befall of me, an thou have not certain news of my life, thou\r\nshalt await me a year and a month and a day, ere thou marry again,\r\nbeginning from this the day of my departure.' The lady, who wept sore,\r\nanswered, 'Messer Torello, I know not how I shall endure the chagrin\r\nwherein you leave me by your departure; but, an my life prove stronger\r\nthan my grief and aught befall you, you may live and die assured that\r\nI shall live and die the wife of Messer Torello and of his memory.'\r\n'Wife,' rejoined Messer Torello, 'I am very certain that, inasmuch as\r\nin thee lieth, this that thou promisest me will come to pass; but thou\r\nart a young woman and fair and of high family and thy worth is great\r\nand everywhere known; wherefore I doubt not but many great and noble\r\ngentlemen will, should aught be misdoubted of me,[475] demand thee of\r\nthy brethren and kinsfolk; from whose importunities, how much soever\r\nthou mightest wish, thou wilt not be able to defend thyself and it\r\nwill behove thee perforce comply with their wishes; and this is why I\r\nask of thee this term and not a greater one.' Quoth the lady, 'I will\r\ndo what I may of that which I have told you, and should it\r\nnevertheless behove me to do otherwise, I will assuredly obey you in\r\nthis that you enjoin me; but I pray God that He bring nor you nor me\r\nto such an extremity in these days.' This said, she embraced him,\r\nweeping, and drawing a ring from her finger, gave it to him, saying,\r\n'And it chance that I die ere I see you again, remember me when you\r\nlook upon this ring.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 475: _i.e._ should any rumour get wind of death.]\r\n\r\nTorello took the ring and mounted to horse; then, bidding all his\r\npeople adieu, he set out on his journey and came presently with his\r\ncompany to Genoa. There he embarked on board a galleon and coming in a\r\nlittle while to Acre, joined himself to the other army[476] of the\r\nChristians, wherein, well nigh out of hand, there began a sore\r\nsickness and mortality. During this, whether by Saladin's skill or of\r\nhis good fortune, well nigh all the remnant of the Christians who had\r\nescaped alive were taken by him, without blow stricken, and divided\r\namong many cities and imprisoned. Messer Torello was one of those\r\ntaken and was carried prisoner to Alexandria, where, being unknown and\r\nfearing to make himself known, he addressed himself, of necessity\r\nconstrained, to the training of hawks, of which he was a great master,\r\nand by this he came under the notice of Saladin, who took him out of\r\nprison and entertained him for his falconer. Messer Torello, who was\r\ncalled by the Soldan by none other name than the Christian, recognized\r\nhim not nor did Saladin recognize him; nay, all his thoughts were in\r\nPavia and he had more than once essayed to flee, but without avail;\r\nwherefore, certain Genoese coming ambassadors to Saladin, to treat for\r\nthe ransom of sundry of their townsmen, and being about to depart, he\r\nbethought himself to write to his lady, giving her to know that he was\r\nalive and would return to her as quickliest he might and bidding her\r\nawait him. Accordingly, he wrote letters to this effect and instantly\r\nbesought one of the ambassadors, whom he knew, to cause them come to\r\nthe hands of the Abbot of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro, who was his uncle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 476: Sic (_all' altro esercito_). The meaning of this does\r\nnot appear, as no mention has yet been made of two Christian armies.\r\nPerhaps we should translate \"the rest of the army,\" _i.e._ such part\r\nof the remnant of the Christian host as fled to Acre and shut\r\nthemselves up there after the disastrous day of Hittin (23 June,\r\n1187). Acre fell on the 29th July, 1187.]\r\n\r\nThings being at this pass with him, it befell one day that, as Saladin\r\nwas devising with him of his hawks, Messer Torello chanced to smile\r\nand made a motion with his mouth, which the former had much noted,\r\nwhat while he was in his house at Pavia. This brought the gentleman to\r\nhis mind and looking steadfastly upon him, himseemed it was himself;\r\nwherefore, leaving the former discourse, 'Harkye, Christian, said he,\r\n'What countryman art thou of the West?' 'My lord,' replied Torello, 'I\r\nam a Lombard of a city called Pavia, a poor man and of mean\r\ncondition.' Saladin, hearing this, was in a manner certified of the\r\ntruth of his suspicion and said joyfully in himself, 'God hath\r\nvouchsafed me an opportunity of showing this man how grateful his\r\ncourtesy was to me.' Accordingly, without saying otherwhat, he let\r\nlay out all his apparel in a chamber and carrying him thither, said to\r\nhim, 'Look, Christian, if there be any among these gowns that thou\r\nhast ever seen.' Torello looked and saw those which his lady had given\r\nSaladin; but, natheless, conceiving not that they could possibly be\r\nthe same, he answered, 'My lord, I know none of them; albeit, in good\r\nsooth, these twain do favour certain gowns wherewithal I, together\r\nwith three merchants who came to my house, was invested aforetime.'\r\nThereupon Saladin, unable to contain himself farther, embraced him\r\ntenderly, saying, 'You are Messer Torello d'Istria and I am one of the\r\nthree merchants to whom your lady gave these gowns; and now is the\r\ntime come to certify you what manner merchandise mine is, even as I\r\ntold you, at my parting from you, might chance to betide.' Messer\r\nTorello, hearing this, was at once rejoiced and ashamed; rejoiced to\r\nhave had such a guest and ashamed for that himseemed he had\r\nentertained him but scurvily. Then said Saladin, 'Messer Torello,\r\nsince God hath sent you hither to me, henceforth consider that not I,\r\nbut you are master here.' Accordingly, after they had mightily\r\nrejoiced in each other, he clad him in royal apparel and carrying him\r\ninto the presence of all his chief barons, commanded, after saying\r\nmany things in praise of his worth, that he should of all who held his\r\nfavour dear be honoured as himself, which was thenceforward done of\r\nall, but above all of the two gentlemen who had been Saladin's\r\ncompanions in his house.\r\n\r\nThe sudden height of glory to which Messer Torello thus found himself\r\nadvanced put his Lombardy affairs somedele out of his mind, more by\r\ntoken that he had good reason to hope that his letters were by this\r\ncome to his uncle's hands. Now there had died and been buried in the\r\ncamp or rather in the host, of the Christians, the day they were taken\r\nby Saladin, a Provençal gentleman of little account, by name Messer\r\nTorello de Dignes, by reason whereof, Messer Torello d'Istria being\r\nrenowned throughout the army for his magnificence, whosoever heard\r\nsay, 'Messer Torello is dead,' believed it of Messer Torello d'Istria,\r\nnot of him of Dignes. The hazard of the capture that ensued thereupon\r\nsuffered not those who had been thus misled to be undeceived;\r\nwherefore many Italians returned with this news, amongst whom were\r\nsome who scrupled not to avouch that they had seen him dead and had\r\nbeen at the burial. This, coming to be known of his wife and kinsfolk,\r\nwas the cause of grievous and inexpressible sorrow, not only to them,\r\nbut to all who had known him. It were longsome to set forth what and\r\nhow great was the grief and sorrow and lamentation of his lady; but,\r\nafter having bemoaned herself some months in continual affliction,\r\ncoming to sorrow less and being sought in marriage with the chiefest\r\nmen in Lombardy, she began to be presently importuned by her brothers\r\nand other her kinsfolk to marry again. After having again and again\r\nrefused with many tears, needs must she at the last consent perforce\r\nto do her kinsfolk's will, on condition that she should abide, without\r\ngoing to a husband, so long as she had promised Messer Torello.\r\n\r\nThe lady's affairs at Pavia being at this pass and there lacking maybe\r\neight days of the term appointed for her going to her new husband, it\r\nchanced that Messer Torello espied one day in Alexandria one whom he\r\nhad seen embark with the Genoese ambassadors on board the galley that\r\nwas to carry them back to Genoa, and calling him, asked him what\r\nmanner voyage they had had and when they had reached Genoa; whereto\r\nthe other replied, 'Sir, the galleon (as I heard in Crete, where I\r\nremained,) made an ill voyage; for that, as she drew near unto Sicily,\r\nthere arose a furious northerly wind, which drove her on to the\r\nBarbary quicksands, nor was any one saved; and amongst the rest two\r\nbrothers of mine perished there.' Messer Torello, giving credit to his\r\nwords, which were indeed but too true, and remembering him that the\r\nterm required by him of his wife ended a few days thence, concluded\r\nthat nothing could be known at Pavia of his condition and held it for\r\ncertain that the lady must have married again; wherefore he fell into\r\nsuch a chagrin that he lost [sleep and] appetite and taking to his\r\nbed, determined to die. When Saladin, who loved him above all, heard\r\nof this, he came to him and having, by dint of many and urgent\r\nprayers, learned the cause of his grief and his sickness, upbraided\r\nhim sore for that he had not before told it to him and after besought\r\nhim to be comforted, assuring him that, if he would but take heart, he\r\nwould so contrive that he should be in Pavia at the appointed term and\r\ntold him how. Messer Torello, putting faith in Saladin's words and\r\nhaving many a time heard say that this was possible and had indeed\r\nbeen often enough done, began to take comfort and pressed Saladin to\r\ndespatch. The Soldan accordingly charged a nigromancer of his, of\r\nwhose skill he had aforetime made proof, to cast about for a means\r\nwhereby Messer Torello should be in one night transported upon a bed\r\nto Pavia, to which the magician replied that it should be done, but\r\nthat, for the gentleman's own weal, he must put him to sleep.\r\n\r\nThis done, Saladin returned to Messer Torello and finding him\r\naltogether resolved to seek at any hazard to be in Pavia at the term\r\nappointed, if it were possible, and in default thereof, to die,\r\nbespoke him thus; 'Messer Torello, God knoweth that I neither will nor\r\ncan anywise blame you if you tenderly love your lady and are fearful\r\nof her becoming another's, for that, of all the women I ever saw, she\r\nit is whose manners, whose fashions and whose demeanour, (leaving be\r\nher beauty, which is but a short-lived flower,) appear to me most\r\nworthy to be commended and held dear. It had been very grateful to me,\r\nsince fortune hath sent you hither, that we should have passed\r\ntogether, as equal masters in the governance of this my realm, such\r\ntime as you and I have to live, and if this was not to be vouchsafed\r\nme of God, it being fated that you should take it to heart to seek\r\neither to die or to find yourself in Pavia at the appointed term, I\r\nshould above all have desired to know it in time, that I might have\r\nyou transported to your house with such honour, such magnificence and\r\nin such company as your worth meriteth. However, since this hath not\r\nbeen vouchsafed and you desire to be presently there, I will e'en, as\r\nI may, despatch you thither after the fashion whereof I have bespoken\r\nyou.' 'My lord,' replied Messer Torello, 'your acts, without your\r\nwords, have given me sufficient proof of your favour, which I have\r\nnever merited in such supreme degree, and of that which you say,\r\nthough you had not said it, I shall live and die most assured; but,\r\nsince I have taken this resolve, I pray you that that which you tell\r\nme you will do may be done speedily, for that to-morrow is the last\r\nday I am to be looked for.'\r\n\r\nSaladin answered that this should without fail be accomplished and\r\naccordingly, on the morrow, meaning to send him away that same night,\r\nhe let make, in a great hall of his palace, a very goodly and rich bed\r\nof mattresses, all, according to their usance, of velvet and cloth of\r\ngold and caused lay thereon a counterpoint curiously wrought in\r\nvarious figures with great pearls and jewels of great price (the which\r\nhere in Italy was after esteemed an inestimable treasure) and two\r\npillows such as sorted with a bed of that fashion. This done, he bade\r\ninvest Messer Torello, who was presently well and strong again, in a\r\ngown of the Saracen fashion, the richest and goodliest thing that had\r\never been seen of any, and wind about his head, after their guise, one\r\nof his longest turban-cloths.[477] Then, it growing late, he betook\r\nhimself with many of his barons to the chamber where Messer Torello\r\nwas and seating himself, well nigh weeping, by his side, bespoke him\r\nthus; 'Messer Torello, the hour draweth near that is to sunder me from\r\nyou, and since I may not bear you company nor cause you to be\r\naccompanied, by reason of the nature of the journey you have to make,\r\nwhich suffereth it not, needs must I take leave of you here in this\r\nchamber, to which end I am come hither. Wherefore, ere I commend you\r\nto God, I conjure you, by that love and that friendship that is\r\nbetween us, that you remember you of me and if it be possible, ere our\r\ntimes come to an end, that, whenas you have ordered your affairs in\r\nLombardy, you come at the least once to see me, to the end that, what\r\nwhile I am cheered by your sight, I may then supply the default which\r\nneeds must I presently commit by reason of your haste; and against\r\nthat betide, let it not irk you to visit me with letters and require\r\nme of such things as shall please you; for that of a surety I will\r\nmore gladly do them for you than for any man alive.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote 477: It may be well to remind the European reader that the\r\nturban consists of two parts, _i.e._ a skull-cap and a linen cloth,\r\nwhich is wound round it in various folds and shapes, to form the\r\nwell-known Eastern head-dress.]\r\n\r\nAs for Messer Torello, he could not contain his tears; wherefore,\r\nbeing hindered thereby, he answered, in a few words, that it was\r\nimpossible his benefits and his nobility should ever escape his mind\r\nand that he would without fail do that which he enjoined him, whenas\r\noccasion should be afforded him; whereupon Saladin, having tenderly\r\nembraced him and kissed him, bade him with many tears God speed and\r\ndeparted the chamber. The other barons then all took leave of him and\r\nfollowed the Soldan into the hall where he had caused make ready the\r\nbed. Meanwhile, it waxing late and the nigromant awaiting and pressing\r\nfor despatch, there came a physician to Messer Torello with a draught\r\nand making him believe that he gave it him to fortify him, caused him\r\ndrink it; nor was it long ere he fell asleep and so, by Saladin's\r\ncommandment, was carried into the hall and laid upon the bed\r\naforesaid, whereon the Soldan placed a great and goodly crown of great\r\nprice and inscribed it on such wise that it was after manifestly\r\nunderstood to be sent by him to Messer Torello's lady; after which he\r\nput on Torello's finger a ring, wherein was a carbuncle enchased, so\r\nresplendent that it seemed a lighted flambeau, the value whereof could\r\nscarce be reckoned, and girt him with a sword, whose garniture might\r\nnot lightly be appraised. Moreover, he let hang a fermail on his\r\nbreast, wherein were pearls whose like were never seen, together with\r\nother precious stones galore, and on his either side he caused set two\r\ngreat basins of gold, full of doubloons, and many strings of pearls\r\nand rings and girdles and other things, which it were tedious to\r\nrecount, round about him. This done, he kissed him once more and bade\r\nthe nigromant despatch, whereupon, in his presence, the bed was\r\nincontinent taken away, Messer Torello and all, and Saladin abode\r\ndevising of him with his barons.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Messer Torello had been set down, even as he had requested,\r\nin the church of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro at Pavia, with all the\r\njewels and ornaments aforesaid, and yet slept when, matins having\r\nsounded, the sacristan of the church entered, with a light in his\r\nhand, and chancing suddenly to espy the rich bed, not only marvelled,\r\nbut, seized with a terrible fright, turned and fled. The abbot and the\r\nmonks, seeing him flee, marvelled and questioned him of the cause,\r\nwhich he told them; whereupon quoth the abbot, 'Marry, thou art no\r\nchild nor art thou new to the church that thou shouldst thus lightly\r\ntake fright; let us go see who hath played the bugbear with thee.'\r\nAccordingly, kindling several lights, the abbot and all his monks\r\nentered the church and saw that wonder-rich and goodly bed and thereon\r\nthe gentleman asleep; and what while, misdoubting and fearful, they\r\ngazed upon the noble jewels, without drawing anywise near to the bed,\r\nit befell that, the virtue of the draught being spent, Messer Torello\r\nawoke and heaved a great sigh, which when the monks saw and heard,\r\nthey took to flight, abbot and all, affrighted and crying, 'Lord aid\r\nus!' Messer Torello opened his eyes and looking about him, plainly\r\nperceived himself to be whereas he had asked Saladin to have him\r\ncarried, at which he was mightily content. Then, sitting up, he\r\nparticularly examined that which he had about him, and for all he had\r\nbefore known of the magnificence of Saladin, it seemed to him now\r\ngreater and he knew it more. Nevertheless, without moving farther,\r\nseeing the monks flee and divining why, he proceeded to call the abbot\r\nby name, praying him be not afraid, for that he was Torello his\r\nnephew. The abbot, hearing this, waxed yet more fearful, as holding\r\nhim as dead many months before; but, after awhile, taking assurance by\r\ntrue arguments and hearing himself called, he made the sign of the\r\ncross and went up to him; whereupon quoth Messer Torello, 'How now,\r\nfather mine, of what are you adread? Godamercy, I am alive and\r\nreturned hither from beyond seas.'\r\n\r\nThe abbot, for all he had a great beard and was clad after the Saracen\r\nfashion, presently recognized him and altogether reassured, took him\r\nby the hand, saying, 'My son, thou art welcome back.' Then he\r\ncontinued, 'Thou must not marvel at our affright, for that there is\r\nnot a man in these parts but firmly believeth thee to be dead,\r\ninsomuch that I must tell thee that Madam Adalieta thy wife,\r\novermastered by the prayers and threats of her kinsfolk and against\r\nher own will, is married again and is this morning to go to her new\r\nhusband; ay, and the bride-feast and all that pertaineth unto the\r\nnuptial festivities is prepared.' Therewithal Messer Torello arose\r\nfrom off the rich bed and greeting the abbot and the monks with\r\nmarvellous joyance, prayed them all to speak with none of that his\r\nreturn, against he should have despatched an occasion of his; after\r\nwhich, having caused lay up the costly jewels in safety, he recounted\r\nto his uncle all that had befallen him up to that moment. The abbot\r\nrejoiced in his happy fortunes and together with him, rendered thanks\r\nto God, after which Messer Torello asked him who was his lady's new\r\nhusband. The abbot told him and Torello said, 'I have a mind, ere folk\r\nknow of my return, to see what manner countenance is that of my wife\r\nin these nuptials; wherefore, albeit it is not the usance of men of\r\nyour habit to go to entertainments of this kind, I would have you\r\ncontrive, for the love of me, that we may go thither, you and I.' The\r\nabbot replied that he would well and accordingly, as soon as it was\r\nday, he sent to the new bridegroom, saying that he would fain be at\r\nhis nuptials with a friend of his, whereto the gentleman answered that\r\nit liked him passing well.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, eating-time come, Messer Torello, clad as he was,\r\nrepaired with his uncle to the bridegroom's house, beheld with\r\nwonderment of all who saw him, but recognized of none; and the abbot\r\ntold every one that he was a Saracen sent ambassador from the Soldan\r\nto the King of France. He was, therefore, seated at a table right\r\noveragainst his lady, whom he beheld with the utmost pleasure, and\r\nhimseemed she was troubled in countenance at these new nuptials. She,\r\nin her turn, looked whiles upon him, but not of any cognizance that\r\nshe had of him, for that his great beard and outlandish habit and the\r\nfirm assurance she had that he was dead hindered her thereof.\r\nPresently, whenas it seemed to him time to essay if she remembered her\r\nof him, he took the ring she had given him at his parting and calling\r\na lad who served before her, said to him, 'Say to the bride, on my\r\npart, that it is the usance in my country, whenas any stranger, such\r\nas I am here, eateth at the bride-feast of any new-married lady, like\r\nherself, that she, in token that she holdeth him welcome at her table,\r\nsend him the cup, wherein she drinketh, full of wine, whereof after\r\nthe stranger hath drunken what he will, the cup being covered again,\r\nthe bride drinketh the rest.'\r\n\r\nThe page did his errand to the lady, who, like a well-bred and\r\ndiscreet woman as she was, believing him to be some great gentleman,\r\ncommanded, to show him that she had his coming in gree, that a great\r\ngilded cup, which stood before her, should be washed and filled with\r\nwine and carried to the gentleman; and so it was done. Messer Torello,\r\ntaking her ring in his mouth, contrived in drinking to drop it, unseen\r\nof any, into the cup, wherein having left but a little wine, he\r\ncovered it again and despatched it to the lady. Madam Adalieta, taking\r\nthe cup and uncovering it, that she might accomplish his usance, set\r\nit to her mouth and seeing the ring, considered it awhile, without\r\nsaying aught; then, knowing it for that which she had given to Messer\r\nTorello at parting, she took it up and looking fixedly upon him whom\r\nshe deemed a stranger, presently recognized him; whereupon, as she\r\nwere waxen mad, she overthrew the table she had before her and cried\r\nout, saying, 'It is my lord, it is indeed Messer Torello!' Then,\r\nrunning to the place where he sat, she cast herself as far forward as\r\nshe might, without taking thought to her clothes or to aught that was\r\non the table, and clipped him close in her arms nor could, for word or\r\ndeed of any there, be loosed from his neck till she was bidden of\r\nMesser Torello contain herself somewhat, for that time enough would\r\nyet be afforded her to embrace him. She accordingly having arisen and\r\nthe nuptials being by this all troubled, albeit in part more joyous\r\nthan ever for the recovery of such a gentleman, every one, at Messer\r\nTorello's request, abode quiet; whereupon he related to them all that\r\nhad betided him from the day of his departure up to that moment,\r\nconcluding that the gentleman, who, deeming him dead, had taken his\r\nlady to wife, must not hold it ill if he, being alive, took her again\r\nunto himself.\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom, though somewhat mortified, answered frankly and as a\r\nfriend that it rested with himself to do what most pleased him of his\r\nown. Accordingly, the lady put off the ring and crown had of her new\r\ngroom and donned the ring which she had taken from the cup and the\r\ncrown sent her by the Soldan; then, issuing forth of the house where\r\nthey were, they betook themselves, with all the nuptial train, to\r\nMesser Torello's house and there recomforted his disconsolate friends\r\nand kindred and all the townsfolk, who regarded his return as well\r\nnigh a miracle, with long and joyous festival. As for Messer Torello,\r\nafter imparting of his precious jewels to him who had had the expense\r\nof the nuptials, as well as to the abbot and many others, and\r\nsignifying his happy repatriation by more than one message to Saladin,\r\nwhose friend and servant he still professed himself, he lived many\r\nyears thereafterward with his noble lady and thenceforth, used more\r\nhospitality and courtesy than ever. Such then was the issue of the\r\ntroubles of Messer Torello and his beloved lady and the recompense of\r\ntheir cheerful and ready hospitalities, the which many study to\r\npractise, who, albeit they have the wherewithal, do yet so ill\r\ncontrive it that they make those on whom they bestow their courtesies\r\nbuy them, ere they have done with them, for more than their worth;\r\nwherefore, if no reward ensue to them thereof, neither themselves nor\r\nothers should marvel thereat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TENTH STORY\r\n\r\n[Day the Tenth]\r\n\r\n     THE MARQUESS OF SALUZZO, CONSTRAINED BY THE PRAYERS OF HIS\r\n     VASSALS TO MARRY, BUT DETERMINED TO DO IT AFTER HIS OWN\r\n     FASHION, TAKETH TO WIFE THE DAUGHTER OF A PEASANT AND HATH\r\n     OF HER TWO CHILDREN, WHOM HE MAKETH BELIEVE TO HER TO PUT TO\r\n     DEATH; AFTER WHICH, FEIGNING TO BE GROWN WEARY OF HER AND TO\r\n     HAVE TAKEN ANOTHER WIFE, HE LETTETH BRING HIS OWN DAUGHTER\r\n     HOME TO HIS HOUSE, AS SHE WERE HIS NEW BRIDE, AND TURNETH\r\n     HIS WIFE AWAY IN HER SHIFT; BUT, FINDING HER PATIENT UNDER\r\n     EVERYTHING, HE FETCHETH HER HOME AGAIN, DEARER THAN EVER,\r\n     AND SHOWING HER HER CHILDREN GROWN GREAT, HONOURETH AND\r\n     LETTETH HONOUR HER AS MARCHIONESS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe king's long story being ended and having, to all appearance, much\r\npleased all, Dioneo said, laughing, \"The good man,[478] who looked\r\nthat night to abase the phantom's tail upright,[479] had not given a\r\nbrace of farthings of all the praises that you bestow on Messer\r\nTorello.\" Then, knowing that it rested with him alone to tell, he\r\nproceeded: \"Gentle ladies mine, it appeareth to me that this day hath\r\nbeen given up to Kings and Soldans and the like folk; wherefore, that\r\nI may not remove overfar from you, I purpose to relate to you of a\r\nmarquess, not an act of magnificence, but a monstrous folly, which,\r\nalbeit good ensued to him thereof in the end, I counsel not any to\r\nimitate, for it was a thousand pities that weal betided him thereof.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 478: _i.e._ he who was to have married Madam Adalieta.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 479: See p. 325.]\r\n\r\nIt is now a great while agone since the chief of the house among the\r\nMarquesses of Saluzzo was a youth called Gualtieri, who, having\r\nneither wife nor children, spent his time in nought but hunting and\r\nhawking nor had any thought of taking a wife nor of having children;\r\nwherein he deserved to be reputed very wise. The thing, however, not\r\npleasing his vassals, they besought him many times to take a wife, so\r\nhe might not abide without an heir nor they without a lord, and\r\noffered themselves to find him one of such a fashion and born of such\r\nparents that good hopes might be had of her and he be well content\r\nwith her; whereto he answered, 'My friends, you constrain me unto that\r\nwhich I was altogether resolved never to do, considering how hard a\r\nthing it is to find a wife whose fashions sort well within one's own\r\nhumour and how great an abundance there is of the contrary sort and\r\nhow dour a life is his who happeneth upon a woman not well suited unto\r\nhim. To say that you think, by the manners and fashions of the\r\nparents, to know the daughters, wherefrom you argue to give me a wife\r\nsuch as will please me, is a folly, since I know not whence you may\r\navail to know their fathers nor yet the secrets of their mothers; and\r\neven did you know them, daughters are often unlike their parents.\r\nHowever, since it e'en pleaseth you to bind me in these chains, I am\r\ncontent to do your desire; but, that I may not have occasion to\r\ncomplain of other than myself, if it prove ill done, I mean to find a\r\nwife for myself, certifying you that, whomsoever I may take me, if she\r\nbe not honoured of you as your lady and mistress, you shall prove, to\r\nyour cost, how much it irketh me to have at your entreaty taken a wife\r\nagainst mine own will.'\r\n\r\nThe good honest men replied that they were content, so he would but\r\nbring himself to take a wife. Now the fashions of a poor girl, who was\r\nof a village near to his house, had long pleased Gualtieri, and\r\nhimseeming she was fair enough, he judged that he might lead a very\r\ncomfortable life with her; wherefore, without seeking farther, he\r\ndetermined to marry her and sending for her father, who was a very\r\npoor man, agreed with him to take her to wife. This done, he assembled\r\nall his friends of the country round and said to them, 'My friends, it\r\nhath pleased and pleaseth you that I should dispose me to take a wife\r\nand I have resigned myself thereto, more to complease you than of any\r\ndesire I have for marriage. You know what you promised me, to wit,\r\nthat you would be content with and honour as your lady and mistress\r\nher whom I should take, whosoever she might be; wherefore the time is\r\ncome when I am to keep my promise to you and when I would have you\r\nkeep yours to me. I have found a damsel after mine own heart and\r\npurpose within some few days hence to marry her and bring her home to\r\nmy house; wherefore do you bethink yourselves how the bride-feast may\r\nbe a goodly one and how you may receive her with honour, on such wise\r\nthat I may avouch myself contented of your promise, even as you will\r\nhave cause to be of mine.' The good folk all answered joyfully that\r\nthis liked them well and that, be she who he would, they would hold\r\nher for lady and mistress and honour her as such in all things; after\r\nwhich they all addressed themselves to hold fair and high and glad\r\nfestival and on like wise did Gualtieri, who let make ready very great\r\nand goodly nuptials and bade thereto many his friends and kinsfolk and\r\ngreat gentlemen and others of the neighbourhood. Moreover, he let cut\r\nand fashion store of rich and goodly apparel, after the measure of a\r\ndamsel who seemed to him like of her person to the young woman he was\r\npurposed to marry, and provided also rings and girdles and a rich and\r\ngoodly crown and all that behoveth unto a bride.\r\n\r\nThe day come that he had appointed for the nuptials, Gualtieri towards\r\nhalf tierce mounted to horse, he and all those who were come to do him\r\nhonour, and having ordered everything needful. 'Gentlemen,' quoth he,\r\n'it is time to go fetch the bride.' Then, setting out with all his\r\ncompany, he rode to the village and betaking himself to the house of\r\nthe girl's father, found her returning in great haste with water from\r\nthe spring, so she might after go with other women to see Gualtieri's\r\nbride come. When the marquess saw her, he called her by name, to wit,\r\nGriselda, and asked her where her father was; to which she answered\r\nbashfully, 'My lord, he is within the house.' Thereupon Gualtieri\r\ndismounted and bidding all await him, entered the poor house alone,\r\nwhere he found her father, whose name was Giannucolo, and said to him,\r\n'I am come to marry Griselda, but first I would fain know of her\r\nsomewhat in thy presence.' Accordingly, he asked her if, an he took\r\nher to wife, she would still study to please him, nor take umbrage at\r\naught that he should do or say, and if she would be obedient, and many\r\nother like things, to all of which she answered ay; whereupon\r\nGualtieri, taking her by the hand, led her forth and in the presence\r\nof all his company and of every one else, let strip her naked. Then,\r\nsending for the garments which he had let make, he caused forthright\r\nclothe and shoe her and would have her set the crown on her hair, all\r\ntumbled as it was; after which, all marvelling at this, he said,\r\n'Gentlemen, this is she who I purpose shall be my wife, an she will\r\nhave me to husband.' Then, turning to her, where she stood, all\r\nshamefast and confounded, he said to her, 'Griselda, wilt thou have me\r\nto thy husband?' To which she answered, 'Ay, my lord.' Quoth he, 'And\r\nI will have thee to my wife'; and espoused her in the presence of all.\r\nThen, mounting her on a palfrey, he carried her, honourably\r\naccompanied, to his mansion, where the nuptials were celebrated with\r\nthe utmost splendour and rejoicing, no otherwise than as he had taken\r\nto wife the king's daughter of France.\r\n\r\nThe young wife seemed to have, together with her clothes, changed her\r\nmind and her manners. She was, as we have already said, goodly of\r\nperson and countenance, and even as she was fair, on like wise she\r\nbecame so engaging, so pleasant and so well-mannered that she seemed\r\nrather to have been the child of some noble gentleman than the\r\ndaughter of Giannucolo and a tender of sheep; whereof she made every\r\none marvel who had known her aforetime. Moreover, she was so obedient\r\nto her husband and so diligent in his service that he accounted\r\nhimself the happiest and best contented man in the world; and on like\r\nwise she bore herself with such graciousness and such loving kindness\r\ntowards her husband's subjects that there was none of them but loved\r\nand honoured her with his whole heart, praying all for her welfare and\r\nprosperity and advancement; and whereas they were used to say that\r\nGualtieri had done as one of little wit to take her to wife, they now\r\nwith one accord declared that he was the sagest and best-advised man\r\nalive, for that none other than he might ever have availed to know her\r\nhigh worth, hidden as it was under poor clothes and a rustic habit.\r\nBrief, it was no great while ere she knew so to do that, not only in\r\nher husband's marquisate, but everywhere else, she made folk talk of\r\nher virtues and her well-doing and turned to the contrary whatsoever\r\nhad been said against her husband on her account, whenas he married\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe had not long abidden with Gualtieri ere she conceived with child\r\nand in due time bore a daughter, whereat he rejoiced greatly. But, a\r\nlittle after, a new[480] thought having entered his mind, to wit, to\r\nseek, by dint of long tribulation and things unendurable, to make\r\ntrial of her patience, he first goaded her with words, feigning\r\nhimself troubled and saying that his vassals were exceeding ill\r\ncontent with her, by reason of her mean extraction, especially since\r\nthey saw that she bore children, and that they did nothing but\r\nmurmur, being sore chagrined for the birth of her daughter. The lady,\r\nhearing this, replied, without anywise changing countenance or showing\r\nthe least distemperature, 'My lord, do with me that which thou deemest\r\nwill be most for thine honour and solace, for that I shall be content\r\nwith all, knowing, as I do, that I am of less account than they[481]\r\nand that I was unworthy of this dignity to which thou hast advanced me\r\nof thy courtesy.' This reply was mighty agreeable to Gualtieri, for\r\nthat he saw she was not uplifted into aught of pridefulness for any\r\nhonour that himself or others had done her; but, a little after,\r\nhaving in general terms told her that his vassals could not brook this\r\ngirl that had been born of her, he sent to her a serving-man of his,\r\nwhom he had lessoned and who said to her with a very woeful\r\ncountenance, 'Madam, an I would not die, needs must I do that which my\r\nlord commandeth me. He hath bidden me take this your daughter and....'\r\nAnd said no more. The lady, hearing this and seeing the servant's\r\naspect and remembering her of her husband's words, concluded that he\r\nhad enjoined him put the child to death; whereupon, without changing\r\ncountenance, albeit she felt a sore anguish at heart, she straightway\r\ntook her from the cradle and having kissed and blessed her, laid her\r\nin the servant's arms, saying, 'Take her and punctually do that which\r\nthy lord hath enjoined thee; but leave her not to be devoured of the\r\nbeasts and the birds, except he command it thee.' The servant took the\r\nchild and reported that which the lady had said to Gualtieri, who\r\nmarvelled at her constancy and despatched him with the child to a\r\nkinswoman of his at Bologna, praying her to bring her up and rear her\r\ndiligently, without ever saying whose daughter she was.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 480: Or \"strange\" (_nuovo_); see ante, passim.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 481: _i.e._ his vassals.]\r\n\r\nIn course of time the lady again conceived and in due season bore a\r\nmale child, to her husband's great joy; but, that which he had already\r\ndone sufficing him not, he addressed himself to probe her to the quick\r\nwith a yet sorer stroke and accordingly said to her one day with a\r\ntroubled air, 'Wife, since thou hast borne this male child, I have\r\nnowise been able to live in peace with these my people, so sore do\r\nthey murmur that a grandson of Giannucolo should become their lord\r\nafter me; wherefore I misdoubt me, an I would not be driven forth of\r\nmy domains, it will behove me do in this case that which I did\r\notherwhen and ultimately put thee away and take another wife.' The\r\nlady gave ear to him with a patient mind nor answered otherwhat then,\r\n'My lord, study to content thyself and to satisfy thy pleasure and\r\nhave no thought of me, for that nothing is dear to me save in so much\r\nas I see it please thee.' Not many days after, Gualtieri sent for the\r\nson, even as he had sent for the daughter, and making a like show of\r\nhaving him put to death, despatched him to Bologna, there to be\r\nbrought up, even as he had done with the girl; but the lady made no\r\nother countenance nor other words thereof than she had done of the\r\ngirl; whereat Gualtieri marvelled sore and affirmed in himself that no\r\nother woman could have availed to do this that she did; and had he not\r\nseen her tender her children with the utmost fondness, what while it\r\npleased him, he had believed that she did this because she recked no\r\nmore of them; whereas in effect he knew that she did it of her\r\ndiscretion. His vassals, believing that he had caused put the children\r\nto death, blamed him sore, accounting him a barbarous man, and had the\r\nutmost compassion of his wife, who never answered otherwhat to the\r\nladies who condoled with her for her children thus slain, than that\r\nthat which pleased him thereof who had begotten them, pleased her\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nAt last, several years being passed since the birth of the girl,\r\nGualtieri, deeming it time to make the supreme trial of her endurance,\r\ndeclared, in the presence of his people, that he could no longer\r\nendure to have Griselda to wife and that he perceived that he had done\r\nill and boyishly in taking her, wherefore he purposed, as far as in\r\nhim lay, to make interest with the Pope to grant him a dispensation,\r\nso he might put her away and take another wife. For this he was\r\nroundly taken to task by many men of worth, but answered them nothing\r\nsave that needs must it be so. The lady, hearing these things and\r\nherseeming she must look to return to her father's house and maybe\r\ntend sheep again as she had done aforetime, what while she saw another\r\nwoman in possession of him to whom she willed all her weal, sorrowed\r\nsore in herself; but yet, even as she had borne the other affronts of\r\nfortune, so with a firm countenance she addressed herself to bear this\r\nalso. Gualtieri no great while after let come to him from Rome\r\ncounterfeit letters of dispensation and gave his vassals to believe\r\nthat the Pope had thereby licensed him to take another wife and leave\r\nGriselda; then, sending for the latter, he said to her, in presence of\r\nmany, 'Wife, by concession made me of the Pope, I am free to take\r\nanother wife and put thee away, and accordingly, for that mine\r\nancestors have been great gentlemen and lords of this country, whilst\r\nthine have still been husbandmen, I mean that thou be no more my wife,\r\nbut that thou return to Giannucolo his house with the dowry which thou\r\nbroughtest me, and I will after bring hither another wife, for that I\r\nhave found one more sorted to myself.'\r\n\r\nThe lady, hearing this, contained her tears, contrary to the nature of\r\nwoman, though not without great unease, and answered, 'My lord, I ever\r\nknew my mean estate to be nowise sortable with your nobility, and for\r\nthat which I have been with you I have still confessed myself indebted\r\nto you and to God, nor have I ever made nor held it mine, as given to\r\nme, but have still accounted it but as a loan. It pleaseth you to\r\nrequire it again and it must and doth please me to restore it to you.\r\nHere is your ring wherewith you espoused me; take it. You bid me carry\r\naway with me that dowry which I brought hither, which to do you will\r\nneed no paymaster and I neither purse nor packhorse, for I have not\r\nforgotten that you had me naked, and if you account it seemly that\r\nthis my body, wherein I have carried children begotten of you, be seen\r\nof all, I will begone naked; but I pray you, in requital of my\r\nmaidenhead, which I brought hither and bear not hence with me, that it\r\nplease you I may carry away at the least one sole shift over and above\r\nmy dowry.' Gualtieri, who had more mind to weep than to otherwhat,\r\nnatheless kept a stern countenance and said, 'So be it; carry away a\r\nshift.' As many as stood around besought him to give her a gown, so\r\nthat she who had been thirteen years and more his wife should not be\r\nseen go forth of his house on such mean and shameful wise as it was to\r\ndepart in her shift; but their prayers all went for nothing; wherefore\r\nthe lady, having commended them to God, went forth his house in her\r\nshift, barefoot and nothing on her head, and returned to her father,\r\nfollowed by the tears and lamentations of all who saw her. Giannucolo,\r\nwho had never been able to believe it true that Gualtieri should\r\nentertain his daughter to wife and went in daily expectation of this\r\nevent, had kept her the clothes which she had put off the morning that\r\nGualtieri had married her and now brought them to her; whereupon she\r\ndonned them and addressed herself, as she had been wont to do, to the\r\nlittle offices of her father's house, enduring the cruel onslaught of\r\nhostile fortune with a stout heart.\r\n\r\nGualtieri, having done this, gave out to his people that he had chosen\r\na daughter of one of the Counts of Panago and letting make great\r\npreparations for the nuptials, sent for Griselda to come to him and\r\nsaid to her, 'I am about to bring home this lady, whom I have newly\r\ntaken to wife, and mean, at this her first coming, to do her honour.\r\nThou knowest I have no women about me who know how to array me the\r\nrooms nor to do a multitude of things that behove unto such a\r\nfestival; wherefore do thou, who art better versed than any else in\r\nthese household matters, order that which is to do here and let bid\r\nsuch ladies as it seemeth good to thee and receive them as thou wert\r\nmistress here; then, when the nuptials are ended, thou mayst begone\r\nback to thy house.' Albeit these words were all daggers to Griselda's\r\nheart, who had been unable to lay down the love she bore him as she\r\nhad laid down her fair fortune, she replied, 'My lord, I am ready and\r\nwilling.' Then, in her coarse homespun clothes, entering the house,\r\nwhence she had a little before departed in her shift, she fell to\r\nsweeping and ordering the chambers and letting place hangings and\r\ncover-cloths about the saloons and make ready the viands, putting her\r\nhand to everything, as she were some paltry serving-wench of the\r\nhouse, nor ever gave over till she had arrayed and ordered everything\r\nas it behoved. Thereafter, having let invite all the ladies of the\r\ncountry on Gualtieri's part, she awaited the day of the festival,\r\nwhich being come, with a cheerful countenance and the spirit and\r\nbearing of a lady of high degree, for all she had mean clothes on her\r\nback, she received all the ladies who came thither.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Gualtieri, who had caused the two children be diligently\r\nreared in Bologna by his kinswoman, (who was married to a gentleman of\r\nthe Panago family,) the girl being now twelve years old and the\r\nfairest creature that ever was seen and the boy six, had sent to his\r\nkinsman[482] at Bologna, praying him be pleased to come to Saluzzo\r\nwith his son and daughter and take order to bring with him a goodly\r\nand honourable company and bidding him tell every one that he was\r\ncarrying him the young lady to his wife, without otherwise discovering\r\nto any aught of who she was. The gentleman did as the marquess prayed\r\nhim and setting out, with the girl and boy and a goodly company of\r\ngentlefolk, after some days' journey, arrived, about dinner-time, at\r\nSaluzzo, where he found all the countryfolk and many others of the\r\nneighbourhood awaiting Gualtieri's new bride. The latter, being\r\nreceived by the ladies and come into the saloon where the tables were\r\nlaid, Griselda came to meet her, clad as she was, and accosted her\r\nblithely, saying, 'Welcome and fair welcome to my lady.' Thereupon the\r\nladies (who had urgently, but in vain, besought Gualtieri to suffer\r\nGriselda to abide in a chamber or lend her one of the gowns that had\r\nbeen hers, so that she might not go thus before his guests) were\r\nseated at table and it was proceeded to serve them. The girl was eyed\r\nby every one and all declared that Gualtieri had made a good exchange;\r\nand among the rest Griselda commended her amain, both her and her\r\nyoung brother.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 482: _i.e._ the husband of his kinswoman aforesaid.]\r\n\r\nGualtieri perceiving that the strangeness of the case in no wise\r\nchanged her and being assured that this proceeded not from lack of\r\nunderstanding, for that he knew her to be very quick of wit, himseemed\r\nhe had now seen fully as much as he desired of his lady's patience and\r\nhe judged it time to deliver her from the bitterness which he doubted\r\nnot she kept hidden under her constant countenance; wherefore, calling\r\nher to himself, he said to her, smiling, in the presence of every one,\r\n'How deemest thou of our bride?' 'My lord,' answered she, 'I deem\r\nexceeding well of her, and if, as I believe, she is as discreet as she\r\nis fair, I doubt not a whit but you will live the happiest gentleman\r\nin the world with her; but I beseech you, as most I may, that you\r\ninflict not on her those pangs which you inflicted whilere on her who\r\nwas sometime yours; for methinketh she might scarce avail to endure\r\nthem, both because she is younger and because she hath been delicately\r\nreared, whereas the other had been in continual fatigues from a little\r\nchild.' Thereupon, Gualtieri, seeing she firmly believed that the\r\nyoung lady was to be his wife nor therefore spoke anywise less than\r\nwell, seated her by his side and said to her, 'Griselda, it is now\r\ntime that thou reap the fruits of thy long patience and that those who\r\nhave reputed me cruel and unjust and brutish should know that this\r\nwhich I have done I wrought to an end aforeseen, willing to teach thee\r\nto be a wife and to show them how to take and use one and at the same\r\ntime to beget myself perpetual quiet, what while I had to live with\r\nthee; the which, whenas I came to take a wife, I was sore afraid might\r\nnot betide me, and therefore, to make proof thereof, I probed and\r\nafflicted thee after such kind as thou knowest. And meseeming, for\r\nthat I have never perceived that either in word or in deed hast thou\r\ndeparted from my pleasure, that I have of thee that solace which I\r\ndesired, I purpose presently to restore thee, at one stroke, that\r\nwhich I took from thee at many and to requite thee with a supreme\r\ndelight the pangs I have inflicted on thee. Wherefore with a joyful\r\nheart take this whom thou deemest my bride and her brother for thy\r\nchildren and mine; for these be they whom thou and many others have\r\nlong accounted me to have barbarously let put to death; and I am thy\r\nhusband, who loveth thee over all else, believing I may vaunt me that\r\nthere is none else who can be so content of his wife as can I.'\r\n\r\nSo saying, he embraced her and kissed her; then, rising up, he betook\r\nhimself with Griselda, who wept for joy, whereas the daughter, hearing\r\nthese things, sat all stupefied, and tenderly embracing her and her\r\nbrother, undeceived her and many others who were there. Thereupon the\r\nladies arose from table, overjoyed, and withdrew with Griselda into a\r\nchamber, where, with happier augury, pulling off her mean attire, they\r\nclad her anew in a magnificent dress of her own and brought her again\r\nto the saloon, as a gentlewoman, which indeed she appeared, even in\r\nrags. There she rejoiced in her children with wonder-great joy, and\r\nall being overjoyed at this happy issue, they redoubled in feasting\r\nand merrymaking and prolonged the festivities several days, accounting\r\nGualtieri a very wise man, albeit they held the trials which he had\r\nmade of his lady overharsh, nay, intolerable; but over all they held\r\nGriselda most sage. The Count of Panago returned, after some days, to\r\nBologna, and Gualtieri, taking Giannucolo from his labour, placed him\r\nin such estate as befitted his father-in-law, so that he lived in\r\nhonour and great solace and so ended his days; whilst he himself,\r\nhaving nobly married his daughter, lived long and happily with\r\nGriselda, honouring her as most might be. What more can here be said\r\nsave that even in poor cottages there rain down divine spirits from\r\nheaven, like as in princely palaces there be those who were worthier\r\nto tend swine than to have lordship over men? Who but Griselda could,\r\nwith a countenance, not only dry,[483] but cheerful, have endured the\r\nbarbarous and unheard proofs made by Gualtieri? Which latter had not\r\nbelike been ill requited, had he happened upon one who, when he turned\r\nher out of doors in her shift, had let jumble her furbelows of another\r\nto such purpose that a fine gown had come of it.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 483: _i.e._ unwetted with tears.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDioneo's story being finished and the ladies having discoursed amain\r\nthereof, some inclining to one side and some to another, this blaming\r\none thing and that commending it, the king, lifting his eyes to heaven\r\nand seeing that the sun was now low and the hour of vespers at hand,\r\nproceeded, without arising from session, to speak thus, \"Charming\r\nladies, as I doubt not you know, the understanding of mortals\r\nconsisteth not only in having in memory things past and taking\r\ncognizance of things present; but in knowing, by means of the one and\r\nthe other of these, to forecast things future is reputed by men of\r\nmark to consist the greatest wisdom. To-morrow, as you know, it will\r\nbe fifteen days since we departed Florence, to take some diversion for\r\nthe preservation of our health and of our lives, eschewing the woes\r\nand dolours and miseries which, since this pestilential season began,\r\nare continually to be seen about our city. This, to my judgment, we\r\nhave well and honourably done; for that, an I have known to see\r\naright, albeit merry stories and belike incentive to concupiscence\r\nhave been told here and we have continually eaten and drunken well and\r\ndanced and sung and made music, all things apt to incite weak minds to\r\nthings less seemly, I have noted no act, no word, in fine nothing\r\nblameworthy, either on your part or on that of us men; nay, meseemeth\r\nI have seen and felt here a continual decency, an unbroken concord and\r\na constant fraternal familiarity; the which, at once for your honour\r\nand service and for mine own, is, certes, most pleasing to me. Lest,\r\nhowever, for overlong usance aught should grow thereof that might\r\nissue in tediousness, and that none may avail to cavil at our overlong\r\ntarriance,--each of us, moreover, having had his or her share of the\r\nhonour that yet resideth in myself,--I hold it meet, an it be your\r\npleasure, that we now return whence we came; more by token that, if\r\nyou consider aright, our company, already known to several others of\r\nthe neighbourhood, may multiply after a fashion that will deprive us\r\nof our every commodity. Wherefore, if you approve my counsel, I will\r\nretain the crown conferred on me until our departure, which I purpose\r\nshall be to-morrow morning; but, should you determine otherwise, I\r\nhave already in mind whom I shall invest withal for the ensuing day.\"\r\n\r\nMuch was the debate between the ladies and the young men; but\r\nultimately they all took the king's counsel for useful and seemly and\r\ndetermined to do as he proposed; whereupon, calling the seneschal, he\r\nbespoke him of the manner which he should hold on the ensuing morning\r\nand after, having dismissed the company until supper-time, he rose to\r\nhis feet. The ladies and the young men, following his example, gave\r\nthemselves, this to one kind of diversion and that to another, no\r\notherwise than of their wont; and supper-time come, they betook\r\nthemselves to table with the utmost pleasure and after fell to singing\r\nand carolling and making music. Presently, Lauretta leading up a\r\ndance, the king bade Fiammetta sing a song, whereupon she very\r\nblithely proceeded to sing thus:\r\n\r\n       If love came but withouten jealousy,\r\n         I know no lady born\r\n       So blithe as I were, whosoe'er she be.\r\n       If gladsome youthfulness\r\n         In a fair lover might content a maid,\r\n           Virtue and worth discreet,\r\n       Valiance or gentilesse,\r\n         Wit and sweet speech and fashions all arrayed\r\n           In pleasantness complete,\r\n           Certes, I'm she for whose behoof these meet\r\n       In one; for, love-o'erborne,\r\n     All these in him who is my hope I see.\r\n\r\n       But for that I perceive\r\n         That other women are as wise as I,\r\n           I tremble for affright\r\n       And tending to believe\r\n         The worst, in others the desire espy\r\n           Of him who steals my spright;\r\n           Thus this that is my good and chief delight\r\n       Enforceth me, forlorn,\r\n     Sigh sore and live in dole and misery.\r\n\r\n       If I knew fealty such\r\n         In him my lord as I know merit there,\r\n           I were not jealous, I;\r\n       But here is seen so much\r\n         Lovers to tempt, how true they be soe'er,\r\n           I hold all false; whereby\r\n           I'm all disconsolate and fain would die,\r\n       Of each with doubting torn\r\n     Who eyes him, lest she bear him off from me.\r\n\r\n       Be, then, each lady prayed\r\n         By God that she in this be not intent\r\n           'Gainst me to do amiss;\r\n       For, sure, if any maid\r\n         Should or with words or becks or blandishment\r\n           My detriment in this\r\n           Seek or procure and if I know't, ywis,\r\n       Be all my charms forsworn\r\n     But I will make her rue it bitterly.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Fiammetta made an end of her song than Dioneo, who was\r\nbeside her, said, laughing, \"Madam, you would do a great courtesy to\r\nlet all the ladies know who he is, lest you be ousted of his\r\npossession through ignorance, since you would be so sore incensed\r\nthereat.\" After this divers other songs were sung and the night being\r\nnow well nigh half spent, they all, by the king's commandment, betook\r\nthemselves to repose. As the new day appeared, they arose and the\r\nseneschal having already despatched all their gear in advance, they\r\nreturned, under the guidance of their discreet king, to Florence,\r\nwhere the three young men took leave of the seven ladies and leaving\r\nthem in Santa Maria Novella, whence they had set out with them, went\r\nabout their other pleasures, whilst the ladies, whenas it seemed to\r\nthem time, returned to their houses.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE ENDETH THE TENTH AND LAST DAY\r\nOF THE DECAMERON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion of the Author_\r\n\r\n\r\nMost noble damsels, for whose solace I have addressed myself to so\r\nlong a labour, I have now, methinketh, with the aid of the Divine\r\nfavour, (vouchsafed me, as I deem, for your pious prayers and not for\r\nmy proper merits,) throughly accomplished that which I engaged, at the\r\nbeginning of this present work, to do; wherefore, returning thanks\r\nfirst to God and after to you, it behoveth to give rest to my pen and\r\nto my tired hand. Which ere I accord them, I purpose briefly to reply,\r\nas to objections tacitly broached, to certain small matters that may\r\nperadventure be alleged by some one of you or by others, since\r\nmeseemeth very certain that these stories have no especial privilege\r\nmore than other things; nay, I mind me to have shown, at the beginning\r\nof the fourth day, that they have none such. There are, peradventure,\r\nsome of you who will say that I have used overmuch license in\r\ninditing these stories, as well as in making ladies whiles say and\r\nvery often hearken to things not very seemly either to be said or\r\nheard of modest women. This I deny, for that there is nothing so\r\nunseemly as to be forbidden unto any one, so but he express it in\r\nseemly terms, as meseemeth indeed I have here very aptly done. But let\r\nus suppose that it is so (for that I mean not to plead with you, who\r\nwould overcome me,) I say that many reasons very readily offer\r\nthemselves in answer why I have done this. Firstly, if there be aught\r\nthereof[484] in any of them, the nature of the stories required it,\r\nthe which, an they be considered with the rational eye of a person of\r\nunderstanding, it will be abundantly manifest that I could not have\r\notherwise recounted, an I would not altogether disfeature them. And if\r\nperchance there be therein some tittle, some wordlet or two freer,\r\nmaybe, than liketh your squeamish hypocritical prudes, who weigh words\r\nrather than deeds and study more to appear, than to be, good, I say\r\nthat it should no more be forbidden me to write them than it is\r\ncommonly forbidden unto men and women to say all day long _hole_ and\r\n_peg_ and _mortar_ and _pestle_ and _sausage_ and _polony_ and all\r\nmanner like things; without reckoning that no less liberty should be\r\naccorded to my pen than is conceded to the brush of the limner, who,\r\nwithout any (or, at the least, any just) reprehension, maketh--let be\r\nSt. Michael smite the serpent with sword or spear and St. George the\r\ndragon, whereas it pleaseth them--but Adam male and Eve female and\r\naffixeth to the cross, whiles with one nail and whiles with two, the\r\nfeet of Him Himself who willed for the salvation of the human race to\r\ndie upon the rood. Moreover, it is eath enough to see that these\r\nthings are spoken, not in the church, of the affairs whereof it\r\nbehoveth to speak with a mind and in terms alike of the chastest\r\n(albeit among its histories there are tales enough to be found of\r\nanothergates fashion than those written by me), nor yet in the schools\r\nof philosophy, where decency is no less required than otherwhere, nor\r\namong churchmen or philosophers anywhere, but amidst gardens, in a\r\nplace of pleasance and diversion and among men and women, though\r\nyoung, yet of mature wit and not to be led astray by stories, at a\r\ntime when it was not forbidden to the most virtuous to go, for their\r\nown preservation, with their breeches on their heads. Again, such as\r\nthey are, these stories, like everything else, can both harm and\r\nprofit, according to the disposition of the listener. Who knoweth not\r\nthat wine, though, according to Cinciglione and Scolajo[485] and many\r\nothers, an excellent thing for people in health,[486] is hurtful unto\r\nwhoso hath the fever? Shall we say, then, because it harmeth the\r\nfevered, that it is naught? Who knoweth not that fire is most useful,\r\nnay, necessary to mortals? Shall we say, because it burneth houses and\r\nvillages and cities, that it is naught? Arms on like wise assure the\r\nwelfare of those who desire to live in peace and yet oftentimes slay\r\nmen, not of any malice of their own, but of the perversity of those\r\nwho use them wrongfully. Corrupt mind never understood word healthily,\r\nand even as seemly words profit not depraved minds, so those which are\r\nnot altogether seemly avail not to contaminate the well-disposed, any\r\nmore than mire can sully the rays of the sun or earthly foulness the\r\nbeauties of the sky. What books, what words, what letters are holier,\r\nworthier, more venerable than those of the Divine Scriptures? Yet many\r\nthere be, who, interpreting them perversely, have brought themselves\r\nand others to perdition. Everything in itself is good unto somewhat\r\nand ill used, may be in many things harmful; and so say I of my\r\nstories. If any be minded to draw therefrom ill counsel or ill\r\npractice, they will nowise forbid it him, if perchance they have it in\r\nthem or be strained and twisted into having it; and who so will have\r\nprofit and utility thereof, they will not deny it him, nor will they\r\nbe ever styled or accounted other than useful and seemly, if they be\r\nread at those times and to those persons for which and for whom they\r\nhave been recounted. Whoso hath to say paternosters or to make tarts\r\nand puddings for her spiritual director, let her leave them be; they\r\nwill not run after any to make her read them; albeit your she-saints\r\nthemselves now and again say and even do fine things.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 484: _i.e._ of overmuch licence.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 485: Two noted wine-bidders of the time.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 486: Lit. living folk (_viventi_).]\r\n\r\nThere be some ladies also who will say that there are some stories\r\nhere, which had been better away. Granted; but I could not nor should\r\nwrite aught save those actually related, wherefore those who told them\r\nshould have told them goodly and I would have written them goodly.\r\nBut, if folk will e'en pretend that I am both the inventor and writer\r\nthereof (which I am not), I say that I should not take shame to myself\r\nthat they were not all alike goodly, for that there is no craftsman\r\nliving (barring God) who doth everything alike well and completely;\r\nwitness Charlemagne, who was the first maker of the Paladins, but knew\r\nnot to make so many thereof that he might avail to form an army of\r\nthem alone. In the multitude of things, needs must divers qualities\r\nthereof be found. No field was ever so well tilled but therein or\r\nnettles or thistles or somewhat of briers or other weeds might be\r\nfound mingled with the better herbs. Besides, having to speak to\r\nsimple lasses, such as you are for the most part, it had been folly to\r\ngo seeking and wearying myself to find very choice and exquisite\r\nmatters, and to use great pains to speak very measuredly. Algates,\r\nwhoso goeth reading among these, let him leave those which offend and\r\nread those which divert. They all, not to lead any one into error,\r\nbear branded upon the forefront that which they hold hidden within\r\ntheir bosoms.\r\n\r\nAgain, I doubt not but there be those who will say that some of them\r\nare overlong; to whom I say again that whoso hath overwhat to do doth\r\nfolly to read these stories, even though they were brief. And albeit a\r\ngreat while is passed from the time when I began to write to this\r\npresent hour whenas I come to the end of my toils, it hath not\r\ntherefor escaped my memory that I proffered this my travail to idle\r\nwomen and not to others, and unto whoso readeth to pass away the time,\r\nnothing can be overlong, so but it do that for which he useth it.\r\nThings brief are far better suited unto students, who study, not to\r\npass away, but usefully to employ time, than to you ladies, who have\r\non your hands all the time that you spend not in the pleasures of\r\nlove; more by token that, as none of you goeth to Athens or Bologna or\r\nParis to study, it behoveth to speak to you more at large than to\r\nthose who have had their wits whetted by study. Again, I doubt not a\r\njot but there be yet some of you who will say that the things\r\naforesaid are full of quips and cranks and quodlibets and that it ill\r\nbeseemeth a man of weight and gravity to have written thus. To these I\r\nam bound to render and do render thanks, for that, moved by a virtuous\r\njealousy, they are so tender of my fame; but to their objection I\r\nreply on this wise; I confess to being a man of weight and to have\r\nbeen often weighed in my time, wherefore, speaking to those ladies who\r\nhave not weighed me, I declare that I am not heavy; nay, I am so light\r\nthat I abide like a nutgall in water, and considering that the\r\npreachments made of friars, to rebuke men of their sins, are nowadays\r\nfor the most part seen full of quips and cranks and gibes, I conceived\r\nthat these latter would not sit amiss in my stories written to ease\r\nwomen of melancholy. Algates, an they should laugh overmuch on that\r\naccount, the Lamentations of Jeremiah, the Passion of our Saviour and\r\nthe Complaint of Mary Magdalen will lightly avail to cure them\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nAgain, who can doubt but there will to boot be found some to say that\r\nI have an ill tongue and a venomous, for that I have in sundry places\r\nwritten the truth anent the friars? To those who shall say thus it\r\nmust be forgiven, since it is not credible that they are moved by\r\nother than just cause, for that the friars are a good sort of folk,\r\nwho eschew unease for the love of God and who grind with a full head\r\nof water and tell no tales, and but that they all savour somewhat of\r\nthe buck-goat, their commerce would be far more agreeable. Natheless,\r\nI confess that the things of this world have no stability and are\r\nstill on the change, and so may it have befallen of my tongue, the\r\nwhich, not to trust to mine own judgment, (which I eschew as most I\r\nmay in my affairs,) a she-neighbour of mine told me, not long since,\r\nwas the best and sweetest in the world; and in good sooth, were this\r\nthe case, there had been few of the foregoing stories to write. But,\r\nfor that those who say thus speak despitefully, I will have that which\r\nhath been said suffice them for a reply; wherefore, leaving each of\r\nyou henceforth to say and believe as seemeth good to her, it is time\r\nfor me to make an end of words, humbly thanking Him who hath, after so\r\nlong a labour, brought us with His help to the desired end. And you,\r\ncharming ladies, abide you in peace with His favour, remembering you\r\nof me, if perchance it profit any of you aught to have read these\r\nstories.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE ENDETH THE BOOK CALLED DECAMERON\r\nAND SURNAMED PRINCE GALAHALT",
