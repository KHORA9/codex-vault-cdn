Cushing & Co.--Berwick & Smith\r\n     Norwood Mass. U.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nFor twenty-five years Professor Mau has devoted himself to the study\r\nof Pompeii, spending his summers among the ruins and his winters in\r\nRome, working up the new material. He holds a unique place among the\r\nscholars who have given attention to Pompeian antiquities, and his\r\ncontributions to the literature of the subject have been numerous in\r\nboth German and Italian. The present volume, however, is not a\r\ntranslation of one previously issued, but a new work first published\r\nin English, the liberality of the publishers having made it possible\r\nto secure assistance for the preparation of certain restorations and\r\nother drawings which Professor Mau desired to have made as\r\nillustrating his interpretation of the ruins.\r\n\r\nIn one respect there is an essential difference between the remains of\r\nPompeii and those of the large and famous cities of antiquity, as Rome\r\nor Athens, which have associated with them the familiar names of\r\nhistorical characters. Mars' Hill is clothed with human interest, if\r\nfor no other reason, because of its relation to the work of the\r\nApostle Paul; while the Roman Forum and the Palatine, barren as they\r\nseem to-day, teem with life as there rise before the mind's eye the\r\nscenes presented in the pages of classical writers. But the Campanian\r\ncity played an unimportant part in contemporary history; the name of\r\nnot a single great Pompeian is recorded. The ruins, deprived of the\r\ninterest arising from historical associations, must be interpreted\r\nwith little help from literary sources, and repeopled with aggregate\r\nrather than individual life.\r\n\r\nA few Pompeians, whose features have survived in herms or statues and\r\nwhose names are known from the inscriptions, seem near to us,--such\r\nare Caecilius Jucundus and the generous priestess Eumachia; but the\r\ncharacters most commonly associated with the city are those of\r\nfiction. Here, in a greater degree than in most places, the work of\r\nreconstruction involves the handling of countless bits of evidence,\r\nwhich, when viewed by themselves, often seem too minute to be of\r\nimportance; the blending of these into a complete and faithful picture\r\nis a task of infinite painstaking, the difficulty of which will best\r\nbe appreciated by one who has worked in this field.\r\n\r\nIt was at first proposed to place at the end of the book a series of\r\nbibliographical notes on the different chapters, giving references to\r\nthe more important treatises and articles dealing with the matters\r\npresented. But on fuller consideration it seemed unnecessary thus to\r\nadd to the bulk of the volume; those who are interested in the study\r\nof a particular building or aspect of Pompeian culture will naturally\r\nturn to the _Pompeianarum antiquitatum historia_, the reports in the\r\n_Notizie degli Scavi_, the reports and articles by Professor Mau in\r\nthe Roman _Mittheilungen_ of the German Archaeological Institute, the\r\nOverbeck-Mau _Pompeji_, the Studies by Mau and by Nissen, the\r\ncommemorative volume issued in 1879 under the title _Pompei e la\r\nregione sotterrata dal Vesuvio_, the catalogues of the paintings by\r\nHelbig and Sogliano, together with Mau's _Geschichte der decorativen\r\nWandmalerei in Pompeji_, H. von Rohden's _Terracotten von Pompeji_,\r\nand the older illustrated works, as well as the beautiful volume,\r\n_Pompeji vor der Zerstoerung_, published in 1897 by Weichardt.\r\n\r\nThe titles of more than five hundred books and pamphlets relating to\r\nPompeii are given in Furchheim's _Bibliografia di Pompei_ (second\r\nedition, Naples, 1891). To this list should be added an elaborate work\r\non the temple of Isis, _Aedis Isidis Pompeiana_, which is soon to\r\nappear. The copperplates for the engravings were prepared at the\r\nexpense of the old Accademia ercolanese, but only the first section of\r\nthe work was published; the plates, fortunately, have been preserved\r\nwithout injury, and the publication has at last been undertaken by\r\nProfessor Sogliano.\r\n\r\nProfessor Mau wishes to make grateful acknowledgment of obligation to\r\nMessrs. C. Bazzani, R. Koldewey, G. Randanini, and G. Tognetti for\r\nkind assistance in making ready for the engraver the drawings\r\npresenting restorations of buildings; to the authorities of the German\r\nArchaeological Institute for freely granting the use of a number of\r\ndrawings in its collection; and to the photographer, Giacomo Brogi of\r\nFlorence, for placing his collection of photographs at the author's\r\ndisposal and making special prints for the use of the engraver. In\r\naddition to the photographs obtained from Brogi, a small number were\r\nfurnished for the volume by the translator, and a few were derived\r\nfrom other sources.\r\n\r\nThe restorations are not fanciful. They were made with the help of\r\ncareful measurements and of computations based upon the existing\r\nremains; occasionally also evidence derived from reliefs and wall\r\npaintings was utilized. Uncertain details are generally omitted.\r\n\r\nIt is due to Professor Mau to say that in preparing his manuscript for\r\nEnglish readers I have, with his permission, made some changes. The\r\norder of presentation has occasionally been altered. In several\r\nchapters the German manuscript has been abridged, while in others,\r\ncontaining points in regard to which English readers might desire a\r\nsomewhat fuller statement, I have made slight additions. The\r\npreparation of the English form of the volume, undertaken for reasons\r\nof friendship, has been less a task than a pleasure.\r\n\r\n     FRANCIS W. KELSEY.\r\n\r\n     ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN,\r\n     October 25, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author and the translator unite in expressing their deep\r\nappreciation of the kind reception accorded to the first edition of\r\nthis book.\r\n\r\nThe second edition has been revised on the spot. Besides minor\r\nadditions, it has been enlarged by a chapter on the recently\r\ndiscovered temple of Venus Pompeiana, and a Bibliographical Appendix;\r\nprepared in response to requests from various quarters. Among the new\r\nillustrations in the text are a restoration of the temple of Vespasian\r\nand a reproduction of the bronze youth found in 1900, besides the\r\nAlexandria patera and one of the skeleton cups from the Boscoreale\r\ntreasure; in Plate VIII are presented two additional paintings from\r\nthe house of the Vettii.\r\n\r\nThe translator is alone responsible for Chapter LIX, which was\r\nprepared for the first edition at Professor Mau's request, at a time\r\nwhen he was pressed with other work; for the paragraphs in regard to\r\nthe treasure of Boscoreale, and for one-half of the references in the\r\nBibliographical Appendix.\r\n\r\n     AUGUST MAU\r\n     FRANCIS W.

Its waves dashed upon\r\nthe base of the mountains which now, rising with steep slope, mark the\r\neastern boundary of the Campanian Plain--Mt. Tifata above Capua, Mt.\r\nTaburno back of Nola, and lying across the southeast corner, the huge\r\nmass of Monte Sant' Angelo, whose sharply defined line of elevation is\r\ncontinued in the heights of Sorrento.\r\n\r\nThis gulf was transformed by volcanic agencies into a fertile plain.\r\nHere two fissures in the earth's crust cross each other, each marked\r\nby a series of extinct or active volcanoes. One fissure runs in the\r\ndirection of the Italian Peninsula; along it lie Monti Berici near\r\nVicenza, Mt. Amiata below Chiusi, the lakes of Bolsena and Bracciano\r\nfilling extinct craters, the Alban Mountains, and finally Stromboli\r\nand Aetna. The other runs from east to west; its direction is\r\nindicated by Mt. Vulture near Venosa, Mt. Epomeo on the island of\r\nIschia, and the Ponza Islands.\r\n\r\nAt three places in the old sea basin the subterranean fires burst\r\nforth. Near the north shore rose the great volcano of Rocca Monfina,\r\nwhich added itself to the Volscian Mountains, and heaping the products\r\nof its eruptions upon Mons Massicus,--once an island,--formed with\r\nthis the northern boundary of the plain. Toward the middle the\r\nnumerous small vents of the Phlegraean Fields threw up the low\r\nheights, to which the north shore of the Bay of Naples--Posilipo,\r\nBaiae, Misenum--is indebted for its incomparable beauty of landscape.\r\nFinally, near the south shore, at the intersection of the fissures,\r\nthe massive cone of Vesuvius rose, in complete isolation--the only\r\nvolcano on the continent of Europe still remaining active. Its base on\r\nthe southwest is washed by the sea, while on the other sides a stretch\r\nof level country separates it from the mountains that hem in the\r\nplain. On the side opposite from the sea, however, Vesuvius comes so\r\nnear to the mountains that we may well say that it divides the\r\nCampanian plain into two parts, of which the larger, on the northwest\r\nside, is drained by the Volturno; the small southeast section is the\r\nplain of the Sarno.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 1.--Map of Ancient Campania.]\r\n\r\nThe Sarno, like the Umbrian Clitumnus, has no upper course. At the\r\nfoot of Mt. Taburno, bounding the plain on the northeast, are five\r\ncopious springs that soon unite to form a stream. Since 1843 the river\r\nhas been drawn off for purposes of irrigation into three channels,\r\nwhich are graded at different levels; the distribution of water thus\r\nassured makes this part of Campania one of the most fertile districts\r\nin Italy. In antiquity the Sarno must have been confined to a single\r\nchannel; according to Strabo it was navigable for ships.\r\n\r\nIn Roman times three cities shared in the possession of the Sarno\r\nplain. Furthest inland, facing the pass in the mountains that opens\r\ntoward the Gulf of Salerno, lay Nuceria, now Nocera. On the seashore,\r\nwhere the coast road to Sorrento branches off toward the southwest,\r\nwas Stabiae, now Castellammare. North of Stabiae, at the foot of\r\nVesuvius, Pompeii stood, on an elevation overlooking the Sarno, formed\r\nby the end of a stream of lava that in some past age had flowed from\r\nVesuvius down toward the sea. Pompeii thus united the advantages of an\r\neasily fortified hill town with those of a maritime city. \"It lies,\"\r\nsays Strabo, \"on the Sarnus, which accommodates a traffic in both\r\nimports and exports; it is the seaport of Nola, Nuceria, and Acerrae.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 2.--Vesuvius as seen from Naples.]\r\n\r\nA glance at the map will show how conveniently situated Pompeii was to\r\nserve as a seaport for Nola and Nuceria; but it seems hardly credible\r\nthat the inhabitants of Acerrae, which lay much nearer Naples, should\r\nhave preferred for their marine traffic the circuitous route around\r\nVesuvius to the Sarno. However that may have been, Pompeii was beyond\r\ndoubt the most important town in the Sarno plain.\r\n\r\nPompeii formerly lay nearer the sea and nearer the river than at\r\npresent. In the course of the centuries alluvial deposits have pushed\r\nthe shore line further and further away. It is now about a mile and a\r\nquarter from the nearest point of the city to the sea; in antiquity it\r\nwas less than a third of a mile. The line of the ancient coast can\r\nstill be traced by means of a clearly marked depression, beyond which\r\nthe stratification of the volcanic deposits thrown out in 79 does not\r\nreach. The Sarno, too, now flows nearly two thirds of a mile from\r\nPompeii; in antiquity, according to all indications, it was not more\r\nthan half so far away.\r\n\r\nIn point of climate and outlook, a fairer site for a city could\r\nscarcely have been chosen. The Pompeian, living in clear air, could\r\nlook down upon the fogs which in the wet season frequently rose from\r\nthe river and spread over the plain. And while in winter Stabiae,\r\nlying on the northwest side of Monte Sant' Angelo, enjoyed the sun for\r\nonly a few hours, the elevation on which Pompeii stood, sloping gently\r\ntoward the east and south, more sharply toward the west, was bathed in\r\nsunlight during the entire day.\r\n\r\nWinter at Pompeii is mild and short; spring and autumn are long. The\r\nheat of summer, moreover, is not extreme. In the early morning, it is\r\ntrue, the heat is at times oppressive. No breath of air stirs; and we\r\nlook longingly off upon the expanse of sea where, far away on the\r\nhorizon, in the direction of Capri, a dark line of rippling waves\r\nbecomes visible. Nearer it comes, and nearer. About ten o'clock it\r\nreaches the shore. The leaves begin to rustle, and in a few moments\r\nthe sea breeze sweeps over the city, strong, cool, and invigorating.\r\nThe wind blows till just before sunset. The early hours of the evening\r\nare still; the pavements and the walls of the houses give out the heat\r\nwhich they have absorbed during the day. But soon--perhaps by nine\r\no'clock--the tree tops again begin to murmur, and all night long, from\r\nthe mountains of the interior, a gentle, refreshing stream of air\r\nflows down through the gardens, the roomy atriums and colonnades of\r\nthe houses, the silent streets, and the buildings about the Forum,\r\nwith an effect indescribably soothing.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 3.--View from Pompeii, looking south.]\r\n\r\nHow shall I undertake to convey to the reader who has not visited\r\nPompeii, an impression of the beauty of its situation? Words are weak\r\nwhen confronted with the reality. Sea, mountains, and plain,--strong\r\nand pleasing background,--great masses and brilliant yet harmonious\r\ncolors, splendid foreground effects and hazy vistas, undisturbed\r\nnature and the handiwork of man, all are blended into a landscape of\r\nthe grand style, the like of which I should not know where else to\r\nlook for.\r\n\r\nIf we turn toward the south, we have at our feet the level plain of\r\nthe Sarno, in antiquity as now--we may suppose--not checkered with\r\nvillages but dotted here and there with groups of farm buildings,\r\nsurrounded with stately trees. Beyond the plain rises the lofty\r\nbarrier of Monte Sant' Angelo, thickly wooded in places, its summit\r\nstanding out against the sky in a long, beautiful profile, which,\r\ntoward the right, breaks up into bold, rugged notches; the side of the\r\nmountain below is richly diversified with deep valleys, projecting\r\nridges, and terraces that in the distance seem like steps, where among\r\nvineyards and olive orchards stand two villages fair to look on,\r\nGragnano and Lettere, so near that individual houses can be clearly\r\ndistinguished. Further west the plain before us opens out upon the\r\nsea, while the mountains are continued in the precipitous coast of the\r\npeninsula of Sorrento. Height crowds upon height, with villages\r\nwreathed in olive orchards lying between. Here the hills descend in\r\nterraces to the sea, covered with vegetation to the water's edge;\r\nthere the covering of soil has been cast off from the steep slopes,\r\nexposing the naked rock, which shines in the afternoon sun with a\r\nreddish hue that wonderfully accords with the dark shades of the\r\nfoliage and the brilliant blue of the sea. Further on the tints become\r\nduller, and the sight is blurred; only with effort can we distinguish\r\nSorrento, resting on cliffs that rise almost perpendicularly from the\r\nline of the shore. Further still the outline of the peninsula sinks\r\ninto the sea and gives place to Capri, island of fantastic shape,\r\nwhose crags rising sheer from the water stand out sharply in the\r\nbright sunlight.\r\n\r\nBut we look toward the north, and the splendid variety of form and\r\ncolor vanishes; there stands only the vast, sombre mass of the great\r\ndestroyer, Vesuvius, towering above the city and the plain. The sun as\r\nit nears the horizon veils the bare ashen cone with a mantle of deep\r\nviolet, while the cloud of smoke that rises from the summit shines\r\nwith a golden glow. Far above the base the sides are covered with\r\nvineyards, among which small groups of white houses can here and there\r\nbe seen. West of us the outline of the mountain descends in a strong,\r\nsimple curve to the sea. Just before it blends with the shore there\r\nrise behind it distant heights wrapped in blue haze, the first of\r\nmoderate elevation, then others more prominent and further to the\r\nleft. They are the heights along the north shore of the Bay of\r\nNaples--Gaurus crowned with the monastery of Camaldoli, famous for its\r\nmagnificent view; the cliffs of Baiae, the promontory of Misenum, and\r\nthe lofty cone of Epomeo on the island of Ischia. So the eye traverses\r\nthe whole expanse of the Bay; Naples itself, hidden from our view,\r\nlies between those distant heights and the base of Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile the sun has set behind Misenum; its last rays are\r\nlighting up the cloud of smoke above Vesuvius and the summit of Monte\r\nSant' Angelo. The brilliancy of coloring has faded; the weary eye\r\nfinds rest in the soft afterglow. We also may take leave of these\r\nbeautiful surroundings, and inquire into the beginnings of the city\r\nwhich was founded here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n_BEFORE 79_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Pompeii was founded we do not know. It is more than likely that a\r\nsite so well adapted for a city was occupied at an early date. The\r\noldest building, the Doric temple in the Forum Triangulare, is of the\r\nstyle of the sixth century B.C.; we are safe in assuming that the city\r\nwas then already in existence.[2] The founders were Oscans. They\r\nbelonged to a widely scattered branch of the Italic stock, whose\r\nlanguage, closely related with the Latin, has been imperfectly\r\nrecovered from a considerable number of inscriptions, so imperfectly\r\nthat in each of the longer inscriptions there still remain words the\r\nmeaning of which is obscure or doubtful. From this language the name\r\nof the city came; for _pompe_ in Oscan meant 'five.' The word does\r\nnot, however, appear in its simple form; we have only the adjective\r\nderived from it, _pompaiians_, 'Pompeian.' If we are right in assuming\r\nthat the name appeared in Oscan, as it does in Latin, in the plural\r\nform, it was probably applied first to a gens, or clan, and thence to\r\nthe city; the Latin equivalent of Pompeii would be Quintii. Pompeii\r\nwas thus the city of the clan of the Pompeys, as Tarquinii was the\r\ncity of the Tarquins, and Veii the city of the Veian clan. The name\r\nPompeius was common in Pompeii down to the destruction of the city,\r\nand in other Campanian towns, notably Puteoli, to much later times.\r\n\r\nIn order to follow the course of events at Pompeii, it will be\r\nnecessary to pass briefly in review the main points in the history of\r\nCampania. The Campanian Oscans, sprung from a rude and hardy race,\r\nbecame civilized from contact with the Greeks, who at an early period\r\nhad settled in Cumae, in Dicaearchia, afterward Puteoli, and in\r\nParthenope, later Naples; and the coast climate had an enervating\r\neffect upon them. When toward the end of the fifth century B.C. the\r\nSamnites, kinsmen of the Oscans, left their rugged mountain homes in\r\nthe interior and pressed down toward the coast, the Oscans were unable\r\nto cope with them. In 424 B.C. the Samnites stormed and took Capua, in\r\n420, Cumae; and Pompeii likewise fell into their hands. But they were\r\nno more successful than the Oscans had been in resisting the influence\r\nof Greek culture. How strong this influence was may be seen in the\r\nremains at Pompeii. The architecture of the period was Greek; Greek\r\ndivinities were honored, as Apollo and Zeus Milichius; and the\r\nstandard measures of the _mensa ponderaria_ were inscribed with Greek\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nIn less than a hundred years new strifes arose between the more\r\ncultured Samnites of the plain and their rough and warlike kinsmen in\r\nthe mountains. But Rome took a part in the struggle, and in the\r\nSamnite Wars (343-290 B.C.) brought both the men of the mountains and\r\nthe men of the plain under her dominion. Although the sovereignty of\r\nRome took the form of a perpetual alliance, the cities in reality lost\r\ntheir independence. The complete subjugation and Romanizing of\r\nCampania, however, did not come till the time of the Social War (90-88\r\nB.C.) and the supremacy of Sulla; the Samnites staked all on the\r\nsuccess of the popular party, and lost.\r\n\r\nIn the narrative of these events Pompeii is not often mentioned. At\r\nthe time of the Second Samnite War, in the year 310 B.C., we read that\r\na Roman fleet under Publius Cornelius landed at the mouth of the\r\nSarno, and that a pillaging expedition followed the course of the\r\nriver as far as Nuceria; but the country folk fell on the marauders as\r\nthey were returning, and forced them to give up their booty. We have\r\nno definite information regarding the attitude of the Pompeians after\r\nthe battle of Cannae (216 B.C.); probably they joined the side of\r\nHannibal, who, however, was defeated by Marcus Marcellus near Nola in\r\nthe following year, and was obliged to leave Campania to the Romans.\r\n\r\nIn the Social War, when, in the summer of 90 B.C., the Samnite army\r\nmarched into Campania, Pompeii allied itself with the insurgents; as a\r\nconsequence, in 89, it was besieged by Sulla, but without success. Two\r\nyears later, Sulla went to Asia to conduct the war against\r\nMithridates. Returning victorious in the spring of 83 B.C., he led his\r\narmy into Campania, where he spent the winter of 83-82; his soldiers,\r\ngrown brutal in the Asiatic war and accustomed to every kind of\r\nlicense, may have proved unwelcome guests for the Pompeians.\r\n\r\nThe sequel came in the year 80, when a colony of Roman veterans was\r\nsettled in Pompeii under the leadership of Publius Sulla, a nephew of\r\nthe Dictator. Cicero later made a speech in behalf of this Sulla,\r\ndefending him against the charge that he had taken part in the\r\nconspiracy of Catiline and had tried to induce the old residents of\r\nPompeii to join in the plot. From this speech we learn that Sulla's\r\nreorganization of the city was accomplished with so great regard for\r\nthe interests of the Pompeians, that they ever after held him in\r\ngrateful remembrance. We learn, also, that soon after the founding of\r\nthe colony disputes arose between the old residents and the colonists,\r\nabout the public walks (_ambulationes_) and matters connected with the\r\nvoting; the arrangements for voting had probably been so made as to\r\nthrow the decision always into the hands of the colonists. The\r\ncontroversy was referred to the patrons of the colony, and settled by\r\nthem. From this time on, the life of Pompeii seems not to have\r\ndiffered from that of the other small cities of Italy.\r\n\r\nAs the harbor of Pompeii was on the Sarno, which flowed at some\r\ndistance from the city, there must have been a small settlement at the\r\nlanding place. To this probably belonged a group of buildings, partly\r\nexcavated in 1880-81, lying just across the Sarno canal (canale del\r\nBottaro), about a third of a mile from the Stabian Gate. Here were\r\nfound many skeletons, and with them a quantity of gold jewellery,\r\nwhich was afterward placed in the Museum at Naples. The most\r\nreasonable explanation of the discovery is, that the harbor was here,\r\nand that these persons, gathering up their valuables, fled from\r\nPompeii at the time of the eruption either in order to escape by sea\r\nor to take refuge in Stabiae. Flight in either case was cut off. If\r\nships were in the harbor, they must soon have been filled with the\r\nvolcanic deposits; if there was a bridge across the river it was\r\nprobably thrown down by the earthquake.\r\n\r\nA second suburb sprang up near the sea, in connection with the salt\r\nworks (_salinae_) of the city. Our knowledge of the inhabitants, the\r\nSalinenses, is derived from several inscriptions painted upon walls,\r\nin which they recommend candidates for the municipal offices, and from\r\nan inscription scratched upon the plaster of a column in which a\r\nfuller by the name of Crescens sends them a greeting: _Cresce[n]s\r\nfullo Saline[n]sibus salute[m]_. From another inscription we learn\r\nthat they had an assembly, _conventus_, possibly judicial in its\r\nfunctions; for in connection with a date, it speaks of a fine of\r\ntwenty sesterces, which would amount to about 31/2 shillings, or 85\r\ncents: _VII K. dec. Salinis in conventu multa HS XX_, 'Fine of twenty\r\nsesterces; assembly at Salinae, November 25.' Still another\r\ninscription speaks of attending such a meeting on November 19: _XIII\r\nK. dec. in conventu veni_.\r\n\r\nThe suburb most frequently mentioned was at first called Pagus Felix\r\nSuburbanus, but after the time of Augustus, Pagus Augustus Felix\r\nSuburbanus. Its location is unknown. As it evidently took the name of\r\nFelix from the Dictator Sulla, who used this epithet as a surname, we\r\nmay assume that its origin dates from the establishment of the Roman\r\ncolony; it may have been founded to provide a place for those\r\ninhabitants of Pompeii who had been forced to leave their homes in\r\norder to make room for the colonists. The existence of a fourth suburb\r\nis inferred from two painted inscriptions in which candidates for\r\noffice are recommended by the Campanienses; this name would naturally\r\nbe applied to the inhabitants of a Pagus Campanus, who, perhaps, had\r\noriginally come from Capua.\r\n\r\nOf the government of Pompeii in the earliest times, before the Samnite\r\nconquest, nothing is known. The names of various magistrates in the\r\nSamnite period, however, particularly the period of alliance with Rome\r\n(290-90 B.C.), are learned from inscriptions. Mention is made of a\r\nchief administrative officer (_mediss_, _mediss tovtiks_); of\r\nquaestors, who, probably, like the quaestors in Rome, were charged\r\nwith the financial administration and let the contracts for public\r\nbuildings; and of aediles, to whom, no doubt, was intrusted the care\r\nof streets and buildings, together with the policing of the markets.\r\nThe Latin names of the last two officials suggest that their offices\r\nwere introduced after 290. There was also an assembly called\r\n_kombenniom_, with which we may compare the Latin _conventus_; but\r\nwhether it was an assembly of the people or a city council cannot now\r\nbe determined.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 4.--Venus Pompeiana. From a wall painting.]\r\n\r\nAfter the establishment of the Roman colony, Pompeii was named\r\n_Colonia Cornelia Veneria Pompeianorum_, from the gentile name of the\r\nDictator Sulla (Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix) and from the goddess to\r\nwhom he paid special honor, who now, as Venus Pompeiana, became the\r\ntutelary divinity of the city. This goddess is represented in wall\r\npaintings. In that from which our illustration is taken (Fig. 4), she\r\nappears in a blue mantle studded with golden stars, and wears a crown\r\nset with green stones. Her left hand, which holds a sceptre, rests\r\nupon a rudder; in her right is a twig of olive. A Cupid stands upon a\r\npedestal beside her, holding up a mirror.\r\n\r\nFrom this time the highest official body, as in Roman colonies\r\neverywhere, was the city council, composed of decurions. The\r\nadministration was placed in the hands of two pairs of officials, the\r\nduumvirs with judiciary authority, _duumviri iuri dicundo_, and two\r\naediles, who were responsible for the care of buildings and streets\r\nand the oversight of the markets. When the duumvirs and the aediles\r\njoined in official acts they were known as the Board of Four,\r\n_quattuorviri_. Down to the time of the Empire it appears that the\r\naediles were not designated officially by that name, but by a title\r\nknown to us only in an abbreviated form, _duumviri v. a. sacr. p.\r\nproc._ This probably stands for _duumviri viis, aedibus, sacris\r\npublicis procurandis_, 'duumvirs in charge of the streets, the\r\ntemples, and the public religious festivals.' The title of aedile\r\nseems to have been avoided because it had been in use in the days of\r\nautonomy, and the authorities thought it prudent to suppress\r\neverything that would suggest the former state of independence.\r\nNevertheless, the word retained its place in ordinary speech, as is\r\nshown by its use in the inscriptions painted on walls recommending\r\ncandidates for office; thence it finally forced its way back into the\r\nofficial language. The duumvirs of every fifth year were called\r\nquinquennial duumvirs, _duumviri quinquennales_, and assumed functions\r\ncorresponding with those of the censors at Rome; they gave attention\r\nto matters of finance, and revised the lists of decurions and of\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nAll these officials were elected annually by popular vote. The\r\ncandidates offered themselves beforehand. If none came forward, or\r\nthere were too few,--for the city officials not only received no\r\nsalary, but were under obligation to make generous contributions for\r\npublic purposes, as theatrical representations, games, and\r\nbuildings,--the magistrate who presided at the election named\r\ncandidates for the vacancies; but each candidate so named had the\r\nright to nominate a second for the same vacancy, the second in turn a\r\nthird. The voting was by ballot; each voter threw his voting tablet\r\ninto the urn of his precinct. No information has come down to us\r\nregarding the precincts (_curiae_) into which the city must have been\r\ndivided for electoral purposes.\r\n\r\nThe election of a candidate was valid only in case he received the\r\nvote of an absolute majority of the precincts. If the result was\r\nindecisive for all or a part of the offices, the city council chose an\r\nextraordinary official who bore the title of prefect with judiciary\r\nauthority, _praefectus iuri dicundo_. This prefect took the place of\r\nthe duumvirs, not only when an election was indecisive, but also when\r\nvacancies arose in some other way, or when peculiar conditions seemed\r\nto make it desirable to have an officer of unusual powers, a kind of\r\ndictator; or finally, when the emperor had received the vote; in the\r\nlast two cases, the prefect was undoubtedly appointed by the emperor.\r\nThus, in the years 34 and 40 A.D., the Emperor Caligula was duumvir of\r\nPompeii; but the duties of the office were discharged by a prefect. A\r\nlaw passed in Rome toward the end of the Republic on the motion of a\r\ncertain Petronius contained provisions regarding the appointment of\r\nprefects; one chosen in accordance with them was called _praefectus ex\r\nlege Petronia_, 'prefect according to the law of Petronius.'\r\n\r\nThere were also in Pompeii priests supported by the city, but only a\r\nfew of them are mentioned in the inscriptions. References are found to\r\naugurs and pontifices, to a priest of Mars, and to priests (_flamen_,\r\n_sacerdos_) of Augustus while he was still living; Nero had a priest\r\neven before he ascended the throne. Mention is made of priestesses,\r\ntoo, a priestess of Ceres and Venus, priestesses of Ceres, and others,\r\nthe divinities of whom are not named.\r\n\r\nThe suburbs could scarcely have had a separate administration; they\r\nremained within the jurisdiction of the magistrates of the city. In\r\nthe case of the Pagus Augustus Felix mention is made of a _magister_,\r\n'director,' _ministri_, 'attendants,' and _pagani_, 'pagus officials';\r\nbut apparently these were all appointed for religious functions only,\r\nin connection with the worship of the emperor. The _magister_ and the\r\n_pagani_, in part at least, were freedmen; the four _ministri_, first\r\nappointed in 7 B.C., were slaves.\r\n\r\nApart from commerce, an important source of income for the Pompeians\r\nlay in the fertility of the soil. In antiquity, as now, grapes were\r\ncultivated extensively on the ridge projecting from the foot of\r\nVesuvius toward the south. The evidence afforded by the great number\r\nof wine jars, _amphorae_ (Fig. 5), that have been brought to light\r\nwould warrant this conclusion; and lately wine presses also have been\r\ndiscovered near Boscoreale, above Pompeii. Pliny makes mention of the\r\nPompeian wine, but remarks that indulgence in it brings a headache\r\nthat will last till noon of the following day. The olive too was\r\ncultivated, but only to a limited extent; this we infer from the small\r\ncapacity of the press and other appliances for making oil found in\r\nthe same villa in which the wine presses were discovered. At the\r\npresent time the making of oil is not carried on about Pompeii. In the\r\nplain below the city vegetables were raised, as at the present day;\r\nthe cabbage and onions of Pompeii were highly prized.\r\n\r\nThe working up of the products of the fisheries formed an important\r\nindustry. The fish sauces which so tickled the palate of ancient\r\nepicures, _garum_, _liquamen_, and _muria_, were produced here of the\r\nfinest quality. The making of them seems to have been practically a\r\nmonopoly in the hands of a certain Umbricius Scaurus; a great number\r\nof earthen jars have been found with the mark of his ownership (p.\r\n506).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 5.--An amphora from Boscoreale.]\r\n\r\nThe Pompeians turned to account, also, the volcanic products of\r\nVesuvius. Pumice stone was an article of export. From the lava\r\nmillstones were made for both grain mills and oil mills, which were\r\napparently already in extensive use in the time of Cato the Elder; he\r\ntwice mentions the oil mills of Pompeii. In Pompeii itself the\r\nmillstones of the oldest period are of lava from Vesuvius; later it\r\nwas found that the lava of Rocca Monfina was better adapted for the\r\npurpose, and millstones of that material were preferred. Small\r\nhand-mills of the lava from Vesuvius were in use at Pompeii down to\r\n79; but the larger millstones of this material found in the bakeries\r\nhad been put one side. In shape and finish the mills of local make\r\nwere superior to the more carelessly worked stones from Rocca Monfina;\r\nthe preference for the latter was due to the fact that they contained\r\nnumerous crystals of leucite, which broke off as the mill wore away,\r\nand so kept the grinding surfaces always rough. Millstones from Rocca\r\nMonfina may be seen at different places in Rome, as in the Museum of\r\nthe Baths of Diocletian.\r\n\r\nTo the sources of revenue which contributed to the prosperity of\r\nPompeii we may add the presence of wealthy Romans, who, attracted by\r\nthe delightful climate, built country seats in the vicinity. Among\r\nthem was Cicero, who often speaks of his Pompeian villa (Pompeianum).\r\nThat the imperial family also had a villa here is inferred from a\r\ncurious accident. We read that Drusus, the young son of the Emperor\r\nClaudius, a few days after his betrothal to the daughter of Sejanus,\r\nwas choked to death at Pompeii by a pear which he had thrown up into\r\nthe air and caught in his mouth. These country seats, no doubt, lay on\r\nthe high ground back of Pompeii, toward Vesuvius; they probably faced\r\nthe sea. But the identification of a villa excavated in the last\r\ncentury, and then filled up again, as the villa of Cicero, is wholly\r\nwithout foundation.\r\n\r\n_Salve lucrum_, 'Welcome, Gain!' Such is the inscription which a\r\nPompeian placed in the mosaic floor of his house. _Lucrum gaudium_,\r\n'Gain is pure joy,' we read on the threshold of another house. A\r\nthrifty Pompeian certainly did not lack opportunity to acquire wealth.\r\n\r\nHow large a population Pompeii possessed at the time of the\r\ndestruction of the city it is impossible to determine. A painstaking\r\nexamination of all the houses excavated would afford data for an\r\napproximate estimate; but the results thus far obtained by those who\r\nhave given attention to the subject are unsatisfactory. Fiorelli\r\nassigned to Pompeii twelve thousand inhabitants, Nissen twenty\r\nthousand. Undoubtedly the second estimate is nearer the truth than the\r\nfirst; according to all indication the population may very likely have\r\nexceeded twenty thousand.\r\n\r\nThis population was by no means homogeneous. The original Oscan stock\r\nhad not yet lost its identity; inscriptions in the Oscan dialect are\r\nfound scratched on the plaster of walls decorated in the style\r\nprevalent after the earthquake of the year 63. From the time when the\r\nRoman colony was founded no doubt additions continued to be made to\r\nthe population from various parts of Italy. The Greek element was\r\nparticularly strong. This is proved by the number of Greek names in\r\nthe accounts of Caecilius Jucundus, for example, and by the Greek\r\ninscriptions that have been found on walls and on amphorae. The\r\nGreeks may have come from the neighboring towns; most of them were\r\nprobably freedmen. In a seaport we should expect to find also Greeks\r\nfrom trans-marine cities; and, in fact, an Alexandrian appears in one\r\nof the receipts of Jucundus. There were Orientals, too, as we shall\r\nsee when we come to the temple of Isis.\r\n\r\nThus far there has come to hand no trustworthy evidence for the\r\npresence of Christians at Pompeii; but traces of Jewish influence are\r\nnot lacking. The words _Sodoma_, _Gomora_, are scratched in large\r\nletters on the wall of a house in Region IX (IX. i. 26). They must\r\nhave been written by a Jew, or possibly a Christian; they seem like a\r\nprophecy of the fate of the city.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 6.--The Judgment of Solomon. Wall painting.]\r\n\r\nAnother interesting bit of evidence is a wall painting, which appears\r\nto have as its subject the Judgment of Solomon (Fig. 6). On a tribunal\r\nat the right sits the king with two advisers; the pavilion is well\r\nguarded with soldiers. In front of the tribunal a soldier is about to\r\ncut a child in two with a cleaver. Two women are represented, one of\r\nwhom stands at the block and is already taking hold of the half of the\r\nchild assigned to her, while the other casts herself on her knees as a\r\nsuppliant before the judges. It is not certain that the reference here\r\nis to Solomon; such tales pass from one country to another, and a\r\nsomewhat similar story is told of the Egyptian king Bocchoris. The\r\nbalance of probability is in favor of the view that we have here the\r\nJewish version of the story, because this is consistent with other\r\nfacts that point to the existence of a Jewish colony at Pompeii.\r\n\r\nThe names Maria and Martha appear in wall inscriptions. The assertion\r\nthat Maria here is not the Hebrew name, but the feminine form of the\r\nRoman name Marius, is far astray. It appears in a list of female\r\nslaves who were working in a weaver's establishment, Vitalis,\r\nFlorentina, Amaryllis, Januaria, Heracla, Maria, Lalage, Damalis,\r\nDoris. The Marian family was represented at Pompeii, but the Roman\r\nname Maria could not have been given to a slave. That we have here a\r\nJewish name seems certain since the discovery of the name Martha.\r\n\r\nIn inscriptions upon wine jars we find mention of a certain M.\r\nValerius Abinnerichus, a name which is certainly Jewish or Syrian; but\r\nwhether Abinnerich was a dealer, or the owner of the estate on which\r\nthe wine was produced, cannot be determined. In this connection it is\r\nworth while to note that vessels have been found with the inscribed\r\nlabels, _gar[um] cast[um]_ or _cast[imoniale]_, and _mur[ia] cast[a]_.\r\nAs we learn from Pliny (N. H. XXXI. viii. 95), these fish sauces,\r\nprepared for fast days, were used especially by the Jews.\r\n\r\nSome have thought that the word _Christianos_ can be read in an\r\ninscription written with charcoal, and have fancied that they found a\r\nreference to the persecution of the Christians under Nero. But\r\ncharcoal inscriptions, which will last for centuries when covered with\r\nearth, soon become illegible if exposed to the air; such an\r\ninscription, traced on a wall at the time of the persecutions under\r\nNero, must have disappeared long before the destruction of the city.\r\nThe inscription in question was indistinct when discovered, and has\r\nsince entirely faded; the reading is quite uncertain. If it were\r\nproved that the word \"Christians\" appeared in it, we should be\r\nwarranted only in the inference that Christians were known at Pompeii,\r\nnot that they lived and worshipped there. According to Tertullian\r\n(Apol. 40) there were no Christians in Campania before 79.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[2] It seems strange that traces of other buildings of the same period\r\nhave not been discovered; but, on the other hand, it is far from\r\nprobable that the temple was first erected, and that the city\r\nafterward grew up around it, for in that case the temple must have\r\nbeen placed further west, on the highest point of the elevation,\r\noverlooking the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n_THE CITY OVERWHELMED_\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious to the terrible eruption of 79, Vesuvius was considered an\r\nextinct volcano. \"Above these places,\" says Strabo, writing in the\r\ntime of Augustus, \"lies Vesuvius, the sides of which are well\r\ncultivated, even to the summit. This is level, but quite unproductive.\r\nIt has a cindery appearance; for the rock is porous and of a sooty\r\ncolor, the appearance suggesting that the whole summit may once have\r\nbeen on fire and have contained craters, the fires of which died out\r\nwhen there was no longer anything left to burn.\"\r\n\r\nEarthquakes, however, were of common occurrence in Campania. An\r\nespecially violent shock on the fifth of February, 63 A.D., gave\r\nwarning of the reawakening of Vesuvius. Great damage was done\r\nthroughout the region lying between Naples and Nuceria, but the shock\r\nwas most severe at Pompeii, a large part of the buildings of the city\r\nbeing thrown down. The prosperous and enterprising inhabitants at once\r\nset about rebuilding. When the final catastrophe came, on the\r\ntwenty-fourth of August, 79 A.D., most of the houses were in a good\r\nstate of repair, and the rebuilding of at least two temples, those of\r\nApollo and of Isis, had been completed. This renewing of the city,\r\ncaused by the earthquake, may be looked upon as a fortunate\r\ncircumstance for our studies.\r\n\r\nOur chief source of information for the events of August 24-26, 79, is\r\na couple of letters of the Younger Pliny to Tacitus, who purposed to\r\nmake use of them in writing his history. Pliny was staying at Misenum\r\nwith his uncle, the Elder Pliny, who was in command of the Roman\r\nfleet. In the first letter he tells of his uncle's fate. On the\r\nafternoon of the twenty-fourth, the admiral Pliny set out with ships\r\nto rescue from impending danger the people at the foot of Vesuvius,\r\nparticularly in the vicinity of Herculaneum. He came too late; it was\r\nno longer possible to effect a landing. So he directed his course to\r\nStabiae, where he spent the night; and there on the following morning\r\nhe died, suffocated by the fumes that were exhaled from the earth. The\r\nsecond letter gives an account of the writer's own experiences at\r\nMisenum.\r\n\r\nTo this testimony little is added by the narrative of Dion Cassius,\r\nwhich was written a century and a half later and is known to us only\r\nin abstract; Dion dwells at greater length on the powerful impression\r\nwhich the terrible convulsion of nature left upon those who were\r\nliving at that time. With the help of the letters of Pliny, in\r\nconnection with the facts established by the excavations, it is\r\npossible to picture to ourselves the progress of the eruption with a\r\nfair degree of clearness.\r\n\r\nThe subterranean fires of Vesuvius pressed upward to find an outlet.\r\nThe accumulations of volcanic dust and pumice stone that had been\r\nheaped up on the mountain by former eruptions were again hurled to a\r\ngreat height, and came down upon the surrounding country. On the west\r\nside of Vesuvius they mingled with torrents of rain, and flowed as a\r\nvast stream of mud down over Herculaneum. On the south side, driven by\r\na northwest wind as they descended from the upper air, they spread out\r\ninto a thick cloud, which covered Pompeii and the plain of the Sarno.\r\nOut of this cloud first broken fragments of pumice stone--the average\r\nsize not larger than a walnut--rained down to the depth of eight to\r\nten feet; then followed volcanic dust, wet as it fell by a downpour of\r\nwater, to the depth of six or seven feet. With the storm of dust came\r\nsuccessive shocks of earthquake.\r\n\r\nSuch was, in outline, the course of the eruption. It must have begun\r\nearly in the morning of the twenty-fourth, and the stream of mud must\r\nhave commenced immediately to move in the direction of Herculaneum;\r\nfor shortly after one o'clock on that day the admiral Pliny at Misenum\r\nreceived letters from the region threatened, saying that the danger\r\nwas imminent, and that escape was possible only by sea. Even then the\r\nYounger Pliny saw, high above Vesuvius, the cloud, shaped like an\r\numbrella pine, which was to rain down destruction on Pompeii. Toward\r\nevening, the ships off Herculaneum ran into the hail of pumice stone,\r\nwhich, during the night, reached Stabiae and so increased in violence\r\nthat the admiral Pliny was obliged to leave his sleeping room from\r\nfear that the door would be blocked up by the falling masses.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of the twenty-fifth there was a severe shock of\r\nearthquake, which was felt as far as Misenum. Then the dust began to\r\nfall, and a cloud of fearful blackness, pierced through and through\r\nwith flashes of lightning, settled down over land and sea. At Misenum,\r\neven, it became dark; \"not,\" says Pliny, \"as on a cloudy night when\r\nthere is no moon, but as in a room which has been completely closed.\"\r\n\r\nHow long the fall of dust lasted we can only infer from this, that\r\nwhen it ceased the sun had not yet set. In Misenum, which the shower\r\nof pumice stone had not reached, everything was covered with a thick\r\nlayer of dust. Although the earthquake shocks continued, the\r\ninhabitants went back into their houses. But Pompeii and Stabiae had\r\nbeen covered so deep that only the roofs of the houses, where these\r\nhad not fallen in, projected above the surface; and Herculaneum had\r\nwholly disappeared.\r\n\r\nAll the plain of the Sarno was buried, as were also the slopes of the\r\nmountains on the south. Stabiae, as we have seen, lay at the foot of\r\nthe mountains, on the coast. It had been destroyed by Sulla in the\r\nSocial War; its inhabitants, forced to scatter, settled in the\r\nsurrounding country. In the years 1749-82 numerous buildings were\r\nexcavated in the vicinity, in part luxurious country seats, in part\r\nplain farm buildings; but the excavations were afterward filled up\r\nagain. The covering of Stabiae was like that of Pompeii, only not so\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\nHerculaneum was covered with the same materials; they were not,\r\nhowever, deposited in regular strata, but were mixed together, and\r\nbeing drenched with water, hardened into a kind of tufa which in\r\nplaces reaches a depth of sixty-five feet. Excavating at Herculaneum\r\nis in consequence extremely difficult; and the difficulty is further\r\nincreased by the fact that a modern city, Resina, extends over the\r\ngreater part of the ancient site. The excavations thus far attempted\r\nhave in most cases been conducted by means of underground\r\npassageways. The statement that Herculaneum was overflowed by a stream\r\nof lava, though frequently repeated, is erroneous.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 7.--Cast of a man.]\r\n\r\nThe woodwork of buildings in Pompeii has in many cases been preserved,\r\nbut in a completely charred condition. Frequently where walls were\r\npainted with yellow ochre it has turned red, especially when brought\r\nimmediately into contact with the stratum of dust--a change which this\r\ncolor undergoes when it is exposed to heat. Nevertheless, the\r\ninference would be unwarranted that the products of the eruption fell\r\nupon the city red-hot and caused a general conflagration. The\r\nfragments of pumice stone could scarcely have retained a great degree\r\nof heat after having been so long in the air; it is evident from\r\nPliny's narrative that they were not hot.\r\n\r\nWith the dust a copious rain must have fallen; for the bodies of those\r\nwho perished in the storm of dust left perfect moulds, into a number\r\nof which soft plaster of Paris has been poured, making those casts of\r\nhuman figures which lend a melancholy interest to the collections in\r\nthe little Museum at Pompeii (Fig. 7). The extraordinary freshness of\r\nthese figures, without any suggestion of the wasting away after death,\r\nis explicable only on the supposition that the enveloping dust was\r\ndamp, and so commenced immediately to harden into a permanent shape.\r\nIf the dust had been dry and had packed down and hardened afterwards,\r\nwe should be able to trace at least the beginnings of decay.\r\n\r\nNeither the pumice stone nor the dust, then, could have set wood on\r\nfire. The woodwork must have become charred gradually from the effect\r\nof moisture, as in the case of coal, and the change in the color of\r\nthe yellow ochre must be due to some other cause than the presence of\r\nheat. This is all the more evident from the fact that vestiges of\r\nlocal conflagrations, confined within narrow limits, can here and\r\nthere be traced, kindled by the masses of glowing slag which fell at\r\nthe same time with the pumice stone, or by the fires left burning in\r\nthe houses.\r\n\r\nFrom the number of skeletons discovered in the past few decades, since\r\nan accurate record has been kept, it has been estimated that in\r\nPompeii itself, about two thousand persons perished. As the city\r\ncontained a population of twenty thousand or more, it is evident that\r\nthe majority of the inhabitants fled; since the eruption commenced in\r\nthe morning, while the hail of pumice stone did not begin till\r\nafternoon, those who appreciated the greatness of the danger had time\r\nto escape. It is, however, impossible to say how many fled when it was\r\nalready too late, and lost their lives outside the city. Mention has\r\nalready been made of some who perished at the harbor; others who went\r\nout earlier to the Sarno may have made good their escape. Of those who\r\nremained in the city part were buried in the houses--so with twenty\r\npersons whose skeletons were found in the cellar of the villa of\r\nDiomedes; others, as the hail of pumice stone ceased, ventured out\r\ninto the streets, where they soon succumbed to the shower of dust that\r\nimmediately followed. As the bodies wasted away little except the\r\nbones was left in the hollows formed by the dust that hardened around\r\nthem, and the casts already referred to, which have been made from\r\ntime to time since 1863, give in some cases a remarkably clear and\r\nsharp representation of the victims.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Titus sent a commission of senators into Campania to\r\nreport in what way help could best be rendered. A plan was formed to\r\nrebuild the cities that had been destroyed, and the property of those\r\nwho died without heirs was set aside for this purpose. Nothing came\r\nof it, however, so far as our knowledge goes. Pompeii is indeed\r\nmentioned in the Peutinger Table, a map for travellers made in the\r\nthird century, but the name was apparently given to a post station in\r\nmemory of the former city. Conclusive evidence against the existence\r\nof a new city is the absence of any inscriptions referring to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n_THE UNEARTHING OF THE CITY_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first excavations at Pompeii were undertaken by the survivors\r\nshortly after the destruction of the city. As the upper parts of the\r\nhouses that had not fallen in projected above the surface, it was\r\npossible to locate the places under which objects of value were\r\nburied. Men dug down from the surface at certain points and tunnelled\r\nfrom room to room underneath, breaking through the intervening walls.\r\nThis work was facilitated by the stratification of the volcanic\r\ndeposit; the loose bits of pumice stone in the lower stratum were\r\neasily removed, while the stratum of dust above was compact enough to\r\nfurnish a fairly safe roof for narrow passageways. Only infrequently\r\nis a house discovered that was left undisturbed; from this we\r\nunderstand why comparatively little household furniture of value has\r\nbeen found. Not only were rich house furnishings in demand,--the\r\nexcavators carried away valuable building materials as well. So\r\neagerly were these sought after that large buildings, as those about\r\nthe Forum, were almost completely stripped of their marble.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages Pompeii was quite forgotten. Possibly some remains\r\nof the ancient buildings were yet to be seen; at any rate it seems to\r\nhave been believed that a city once existed there, for the site was\r\ncalled La Civita.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1594-1600 Domenico Fontana was bringing water from one of\r\nthe springs of the Sarno to Torre Annunziata, and in the course of the\r\nwork cut an underground channel through the site of Pompeii and\r\ndiscovered two inscriptions; but no further investigations were made.\r\nThe indifference of Fontana may be explained by the fact that the\r\nwater channel was not dug out from above, like a railway cutting, and\r\nthen covered over, but was carried as a tunnel through the hill on\r\nwhich the city stood, so that the workmen came to the ancient surface\r\nat only a few points. In the part now excavated, the original level\r\nwas disturbed in but one place, near the temple of Zeus Milichius;\r\nhere the inscriptions were probably found.\r\n\r\nThe excavation of the buried Campanian towns began, not at Pompeii,\r\nbut at Herculaneum, where in 1709 the workmen of the Austrian general,\r\nCount Elbeuf, sunk a shaft, reaching the ancient level at the rear of\r\nthe stage of the theatre. The current statement that Elbeuf discovered\r\nthe site of Herculaneum by accident, his workmen being engaged in\r\ndigging a well, is erroneous. The location of the city was already\r\nknown, and Elbeuf was searching for antiquities. The error probably\r\noriginated in a misunderstanding of the Italian word _pozzo_, which\r\nhas a double meaning, \"shaft,\" and \"well.\"\r\n\r\nAt first little was accomplished, but after 1738 excavations were\r\ncarried on by King Charles III in a more systematic manner. The\r\ndirector of these excavations, Rocco Gioacchino de Alcubierre, in\r\nMarch, 1748, had occasion to inspect the water channel mentioned\r\nabove, and learned that at the place called La Civita--which he\r\nthought was Stabiae--objects of antiquity were often found. He came to\r\nthe conclusion that this site was more promising than that of\r\nHerculaneum, where the excavations just then were yielding little of\r\nvalue; the result of his recommendation was that on the thirtieth of\r\nthe same month excavations were commenced at Pompeii, with twelve\r\nworkmen.\r\n\r\nThe first digging was done north of Nola Street, near the Casa del\r\nTorello; then the men were set at work on the Street of Tombs, near\r\nthe Herculaneum Gate; and a part of the Amphitheatre also was cleared.\r\nIn 1750 the work was stopped, because the results were thought to be\r\nunimportant.\r\n\r\nAttention was again directed to Pompeii in 1754, when workmen engaged\r\nin constructing the highway that runs just south of the city\r\ndiscovered a number of tombs. About the same time, west of the\r\nAmphitheatre, the extensive establishment of Julia Felix, arranged\r\nlike a villa, and some buildings lying north of it, were excavated;\r\nbut they were all covered up again, as was also the so-called villa\r\nof Cicero, which was uncovered in 1763.\r\n\r\nThe parts excavated were not left clear until after 1763, when the\r\ndiscovery of the inscription of Suedius Clemens, on the Street of\r\nTombs, had established the fact that the site was that of Pompeii.\r\nImportant discoveries were made soon after. In the years immediately\r\nfollowing 1764 the theatres, with the adjacent buildings, and the\r\nStreet of Tombs, together with the villa of Diomedes, were laid bare.\r\nThe excavations were conducted slowly and without system, yet with\r\nscientific interest fostered by the Herculaneum Academy (Accademia\r\nercolanese), which had been founded in 1755.\r\n\r\nUnder Joseph Bonaparte and Murat, 1806-15, the work received larger\r\nappropriations, and was prosecuted with greater energy, particularly\r\nin the quarter lying between the Herculaneum Gate and the Forum. In\r\nthe same period the Forum was approached from the south side also. In\r\n1799, at the time of the Parthenopean Republic, the French general\r\nChampionnet had excavated, south of the Basilica, the two houses which\r\nare still called by his name. From these, in 1813, the excavators made\r\ntheir way into the Basilica, whence, in November of the same year,\r\nthey pushed forward into the Forum. However, the excavation of the\r\nForum itself with the surrounding buildings, prosecuted less\r\nvigorously and with limited means in the period of the Restoration,\r\nwas not completed till 1825; by this time the temple of Fortuna and\r\nthe Baths north of the Forum had also been uncovered. The following\r\nyears, to 1832, brought to light the beautiful houses on the north\r\nside of Nola Street--the houses of Pansa, of the Tragic Poet, and of\r\nthe Faun--and those on Mercury Street; later came excavations south of\r\nNola Street and in various parts of the city.\r\n\r\nThe disturbances of the period of Revolution caused a cessation of\r\nwork for two years, from July 3, 1848, to September 27, 1850. During\r\nthe next nine years effort was expended chiefly in clearing Stabian\r\nStreet and the Stabian Baths.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Bourbon dynasty and the passing over of Naples to the\r\nKingdom of Italy caused another interruption, which lasted a year,\r\nfrom December 5, 1859, to December 20, 1860. On the last date the\r\nexcavations were resumed under the direction of Giuseppe Fiorelli, a\r\nman of marked individuality, who left a permanent impress upon every\r\npart of the work. To him is due the present admirable system,\r\nexcellent alike from the technical and from the administrative point\r\nof view. We owe it to him, that better provision is made now than\r\nformerly for the preservation and care of excavated buildings and\r\nobjects discovered; the earlier efforts in this direction naturally\r\nleft room for improvement, and the painstaking of the present\r\nadministration is especially worthy of commendation.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 8.--An excavation. Atrium of the house of the\r\n   Silver Wedding, cleared in the autumn of 1892.]\r\n\r\nFiorelli put an end to haphazard digging, to excavating here and there\r\nwherever the site seemed most promising. He first set about clearing\r\nthe undisturbed places lying between the excavated portions; and when\r\nin this way the west part of the city had been laid bare, he commenced\r\nto work systematically from the excavated part toward the east. Since\r\n1860 only one public building has been excavated--the baths at the\r\ncorner of Stabian and Nola streets; but many private houses have been\r\nuncovered, some of which are of much interest. Fiorelli remained in\r\ncharge of the excavations until 1875, when he was called to Rome to\r\nbecome General Director of Museums and Excavations; he died in 1896,\r\nat the age of seventy-two. His successors, first Michele Ruggiero,\r\nthen Giulio de Petra, have worked according to his plans, and in full\r\nsympathy with his ideals.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time about three-fifths of Pompeii have been\r\nexcavated. In 1872 Fiorelli made the calculation that if the\r\nexcavations should continue at the rate then followed the whole city\r\nwould be laid bare in 74 years. Since that time the work has\r\nprogressed more slowly, partly in consequence of the greater care\r\ntaken for the preservation of the remains. At the present rate of\r\nprogress we may believe that the twentieth century will hardly witness\r\nthe completion of the excavations.\r\n\r\nArticles of furniture and objects of art that can easily be moved, as\r\nthe statuettes often found in the gardens, are ordinarily taken to the\r\nMuseum in Naples; a few things have been placed in the little Museum\r\nat Pompeii. Now and then small sculptures have been left in a house\r\nexactly as they were found; but the necessity of keeping such houses\r\nlocked and of guarding them with especial care prevents the general\r\nadoption of this method of preservation.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the preservation of paintings the practice has varied at\r\ndifferent periods. Generally, however, the best pictures have been cut\r\nfrom the walls and transferred to the Museum, while the decorative\r\nframework has been left undisturbed. It is keenly to be regretted that\r\nin this way the effect of the decorative system as a whole has been\r\ndestroyed, for the picture forms the centre of a carefully elaborated\r\nscheme of decoration which needs to be viewed as an artistic whole in\r\norder to be fully appreciated; and the removal of a painting can\r\nhardly be accomplished without some damage to the parts of the wall\r\nimmediately in contact with it. A far better method would be to leave\r\nintact all walls containing paintings or decorative work of interest,\r\nproviding such means of protection against the weather as may be\r\nnecessary. A good beginning in this respect has been made in the case\r\nof the house of the Vettii, the beautiful and well preserved paintings\r\nof which have been left on the walls and are preserved with the\r\ngreatest care.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of a mosaic floor is an altogether different problem.\r\nWhile the floor as a whole, with its ornamental designs, is left in\r\nplace, fine mosaics representing paintings, which are delicate and\r\neasily destroyed, are wisely taken up and placed in the Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO PLAN I\r\n\r\n     The Regions are given as they were laid out by Fiorelli (p.\r\n     34), the boundaries being marked by broken lines. The Insulae\r\n     are designated by Arabic numerals.\r\n\r\n     Stabian Street, between Stabian and Vesuvius gates, separating\r\n     Regions VIII, VII, and VI, from I, IX, and V, is often called\r\n     Cardo, from analogy with the _cardo maximus_ (the north and\r\n     south line) of a Roman camp. Nola Street, leading from the Nola\r\n     Gate, with its continuations (Strada della Fortuna, south of\r\n     Insulae 10, 12, 13, and 14 of Region VI, and Strada della\r\n     Terme, south of VI, 4, 6, 8), was for similar reasons\r\n     designated as the Greater Decuman, _Decumanus Maior_; while the\r\n     street running from the Water Gate to the Sarno Gate (Via\r\n     Marina, Abbondanza Street, Strada dei Diadumeni) is called the\r\n     Lesser Decuman, _Decumanus Minor_.\r\n\r\n     The only Regions wholly excavated are VII and VIII; but only a\r\n     small portion of Region VI remains covered.\r\n\r\n     The towers of the city wall are designated by numbers, as they\r\n     are supposed to have been at the time of the siege of Sulla, in\r\n     89 B.C. (p. 240).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLAN I.--OUTLINE PLAN OF POMPEII.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n_A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outline of Pompeii, with its network of streets, may be traced on\r\nthe accompanying plan.\r\n\r\nThe city took its shape from the end of the old lava stream on which\r\nit lay, which ran southeast from Vesuvius. It formed an irregular oval\r\na little less than four fifths of a mile (1200 metres) long and a\r\nlittle more than two fifths of a mile (720 metres) wide in its\r\ngreatest dimensions. On three sides, west, south, and east, the wall\r\nof the city ran along the edge of the hill; on the northwest side,\r\nbetween the Herculaneum and Capua gates, it passed directly across the\r\nridge formed by the lava.\r\n\r\nThe eight gates are known by the modern names given on our plan. Two\r\nof them, the Herculaneum and Capua gates, lie at the points where the\r\nwall comes to the edge of the lava bed on either side; the streets\r\nthat led from them descended to the plain. At the Herculaneum Gate the\r\nmuch travelled highway from Naples, passing through Herculaneum,\r\nentered the city; the Capua Gate does not seem to have been built to\r\naccommodate a large traffic. Between these two lay the Vesuvius Gate,\r\nthrough which the Pompeians passed out upon the ridge toward Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nFrom the Herculaneum Gate nearly to the Stabian Gate, on the south\r\nside, ran a bluff, with a sharp descent. Nevertheless, as a gate was\r\nneeded on the side nearest the sea, the Water Gate, Porta Marina, was\r\nplaced here; through it a steep road led to the Forum, so steep that\r\nit could not have been much used by vehicles; but that may have\r\nmattered little to the fishermen bringing their catches to the market.\r\n\r\nThe Stabian Gate lay in a depression at the end of the lava bed and\r\nafforded a more convenient means of access to the city; thence a road\r\nran to the harbor on the Sarno, and to Stabiae. At the left another\r\nroad apparently branched off from this in the direction of Nuceria,\r\nwhich could be reached also from the conveniently located Nocera Gate\r\nfurther east; here also the slope of the hill was less pronounced. Two\r\ngates, finally, gave access to the city on the somewhat steeper east\r\nand northeast sides, the Sarno Gate, which takes its name, not from\r\nthe river, but from the modern town of Sarno, and the Nola Gate; it is\r\nat least probable that the road passing through the latter led to\r\nNola.\r\n\r\nA glance at the plan will make it plain that the streets of Pompeii\r\nmust have been laid out according to a definite system; an arrangement\r\non the whole so regular and symmetrical would scarcely be found in a\r\ncity that had developed gradually from a small beginning, in which the\r\nlocation of streets had been the result of accident.\r\n\r\nTwo wide streets that cross the city very nearly at right angles give\r\nthe direction for the other streets running approximately north and\r\nsouth and east and west, Mercury Street with its continuations, and\r\nNola Street. The former probably served as a base line in laying out\r\nthe city; this we infer from the fact that while it is exceptionally\r\nbroad, and the Forum lies on it, there is no gate at either end, and\r\nit could have been little used for traffic. Nola Street has a gate\r\nonly at the east end; the west end opens into the Strada Consolare,\r\nwhich follows the line of the city wall and leads to the Herculaneum\r\nGate at the northwest corner. That the other streets must have taken\r\ntheir direction from these two is clearly seen in the case of those in\r\nthe northwest part of the city; on close examination it will be found\r\nthat the arrangement of the rest also is in accordance with the same\r\nsystem, a fact which would perhaps be still more obvious if the\r\nunexcavated eastern portion of the city were laid bare.\r\n\r\nIn two instances, however, there is a deviation from this system. One\r\nis in the quarter near the Forum. For reasons which have not been\r\nsatisfactorily explained, the Porta Marina was not placed on the\r\nprolongation of the street coming from the Sarno Gate, but further\r\nnorth. In order to reach this gate the street, as shown on the plan,\r\nmakes a bend to the north which is reproduced in the other east and\r\nwest streets lying south of Nola Street; west of the Forum, again,\r\nthe streets converge in order to give access to this gate.\r\n\r\nThe other deviation, which affects Stabian Street, can be explained on\r\ngrounds of convenience. This street, which runs from the Stabian to\r\nthe Vesuvius Gate, abandoned the line of the north and south streets\r\nwest of it in order to take advantage of a natural depression in the\r\nhill, by following which an easy grade could be established to the\r\nhigher parts of the city; that the blocks along this important\r\nthoroughfare might not be too irregular in shape, the nearest parallel\r\nstreets on the east were laid out in such a way as to follow the\r\ndirection of Stabian Street. The street running south from the Capua\r\nGate resumes, with slight variation, the north and south line of\r\nMercury Street.\r\n\r\nThe public buildings of the city form two extensive groups. One group\r\nlies about the Forum (Plan II); with this we may reckon the Baths in\r\nthe first block north, and the temples of Fortuna Augusta and Venus\r\nPompeiana. The nucleus of the other is formed by the two theatres and\r\nthe large quadrangular colonnade which, designed originally to afford\r\nprotection for theatre-goers against the rain, was later turned into\r\nbarracks for the gladiators (Plan III). There are in addition only\r\nfour public buildings that need to be mentioned. Two are bathing\r\nestablishments, the Stabian Baths, and those at the corner of Stabian\r\nand Nola streets. The third is a small building near the Herculaneum\r\nGate, consisting of a hall opening on the street, with a base for a\r\nstatue near the rear wall; this on insufficient grounds has been\r\ncalled a custom-house. The fourth, the Amphitheatre, lies in the\r\nsouthern corner of the city.\r\n\r\nAs the public buildings were thus located in clearly defined groups,\r\nit is not probable that many yet remain in the portion of the city\r\nwhich has not been excavated. We may expect to find only bathing\r\nestablishments, and perhaps one or two temples. There were priestesses\r\nof Ceres and of Venus, but the sanctuary of Ceres has not been\r\ndiscovered. Mention is made also of a priest of Mars; but the temple\r\nof Mars, according to the precept of Vitruvius (I. vii. 1) would be\r\noutside the city.\r\n\r\nA word should be added regarding the modern division of Pompeii into\r\nRegions, or wards, and Insulae. By an Insula is meant--in accordance\r\nwith ancient usage--a block of houses surrounded on all sides by\r\nstreets. The division into Regions was introduced by Fiorelli, and\r\nrests upon a misconception which has been corrected by more recent\r\nexcavations. Fiorelli thought that the Capua Gate and the Nocera Gate\r\nwere connected by a street, and that the city was thus divided by four\r\nstreets (the assumed street, Stabian Street, Nola Street, and\r\nAbbondanza Street with its continuations) into nine Regions, marked on\r\nour plan with the numerals I-IX.\r\n\r\nIn each Region every block, or Insula, has its number, and in the\r\nInsula a separate number is given to every door opening on a street.\r\nThis arrangement is convenient because each house can be accurately\r\ndesignated by means of three numbers.\r\n\r\nOn the plans the Insulae are designated by Arabic numerals, but in the\r\ntext small Roman numerals are used for the sake of clearness; thus,\r\nIns. IX. i. 26, means the first Insula of Region IX, No. 26.\r\n\r\nThe names of several of the more important streets, as of the better\r\nknown houses, are given in the text in the English form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n_BUILDING MATERIALS, CONSTRUCTION, AND ARCHITECTURAL PERIODS_\r\n\r\n\r\nSix centuries lie between the dates of the earliest and the latest\r\nbuildings at Pompeii; and in order to understand any structure rightly\r\nwe must first of all ascertain to what period it belongs. It is indeed\r\nrarely possible to fix dates with exactness for the earlier time; but\r\ncertain periods are so clearly differentiated from one another, that\r\nin most cases there is no room for doubt to which of them a building\r\nis to be assigned. Before undertaking to characterize these periods,\r\nhowever, it will be necessary briefly to notice what building\r\nmaterials were used, and how they were turned to account in\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nExclusive of wood, which was more freely used in Pompeii than in\r\nCampanian towns to-day, the principal building materials were Sarno\r\nlimestone, two kinds of tufa (gray and yellow), lava, a whitish\r\nlimestone often called travertine wrongly, marble, and brick.\r\n\r\nThe Sarno limestone (_pietra di Sarno_) is a deposit from the water of\r\nthe Sarno, and is found in beds along the course of the river. It\r\ncontains many impressions of the leaves and stems of plants, and\r\nvaries greatly in compactness; it closely resembles the Roman\r\ntravertine, except that it has a more decided yellowish tint.\r\n\r\nGray tufa is a volcanic dust which has been hardened by the presence\r\nof water into rock. It has a fine grain, and is easily worked; it was\r\nquarried in the vicinity of Nocera. The volcanic dust which formed the\r\nyellow tufa was thrown out in an earlier period, when the Sarno plain\r\nwas still a part of the sea, and so hardened in salt water; it is more\r\nfriable than the gray tufa, and not so durable.\r\n\r\nThe lava, which came originally from Vesuvius, was quarried at\r\nPompeii. Three varieties may be distinguished, differing in density\r\naccording as they were taken from the lower or the upper strata: solid\r\nlava, or basalt, which, being heavy and extremely hard, was\r\nextensively used for pavements and thresholds; slag, like the scoriae\r\nfound on the sides of Vesuvius to-day; and cruma, the foam of the lava\r\nstream, which is light and porous, but on account of its hardness has\r\ngood resisting qualities.\r\n\r\nThe whitish limestone has a fine texture, without impressions of\r\nleaves, and is of an even color; it was to some extent employed as a\r\nsubstitute for marble. It was not quarried at Pompeii, and was not\r\nextensively used; the most important example of its use is in the\r\nlater colonnade about the Forum. The white Carrara marble (_marmor\r\nlunense_) was preferred for columns, pilasters, and architraves; but\r\ncolored marbles of many varieties, cut into thin slabs and blocks,\r\nwere used as a veneering for walls and in the mosaic floors.\r\n\r\nBricks were used only for the corners of buildings, for doorposts, and\r\nin a few instances, as in the Basilica and the house of the Labyrinth,\r\nfor columns; brick walls are not found in Pompeii. The bricks seen in\r\ncorners and doorposts (Figs. 11, 95) are simply a facing for rubble\r\nwork. They are ordinarily less than an inch thick; they have the shape\r\nof a right-angled triangle, and are so laid that the side representing\r\nthe hypothenuse--about six inches long--appears in the surface of the\r\nwall. Sometimes fragments of roof tiles, more or less irregular in\r\nshape, were used instead. The bricks of the earlier time contain sea\r\nsand and have a granular surface, with a less uniform color; the later\r\nbricks are smooth and even in appearance.\r\n\r\nThe flat oblong roof tiles (_tegulae_), measuring ordinarily 24 by 19\r\nor 20 inches, had flanges at the sides; over the joints where the\r\nflanges came together, joint tiles in the form of a half-cylinder\r\n(_imbrices_) were laid, like those in use at the present day (Figs.\r\n114, 117).\r\n\r\nThe styles of masonry are characteristic and interesting. We may\r\ndistinguish them as masonry with limestone framework, rubble work,\r\nreticulate work, quasi-reticulate work, ashlar work, and, in the case\r\nof columns and entablatures, massive construction.\r\n\r\nThe masonry with limestone framework dates from the earliest period.\r\nThe walls were built without mortar, clay being used instead. Since\r\nthis served only as a filling, without strength as a binding material,\r\nit was necessary to arrange the stones themselves in such a way that\r\nthe wall would stand firm. This result was accomplished by using\r\nlarge, oblong blocks, not only for corners and doorposts, but also for\r\na framework in the body of the wall; as shown in our illustration,\r\nalternate vertical and horizontal blocks were built up into pillars\r\nwhich would hold in place the courses of smaller stones that filled\r\nthe intervening spaces. The material of the larger, hewn blocks, as\r\nwell as of the smaller fragments, was Sarno limestone, with occasional\r\npieces of cruma or slag.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 9.--Wall with limestone framework.]\r\n\r\nThe rubble work, _opus incertum_, consists of fragments irregular in\r\nshape, of the size of the fist and larger, laid in mortar. The\r\nmaterial used in the earlier times was ordinarily lava; later, Sarno\r\nlimestone. Corners and doorposts at first were built of hewn blocks;\r\nafterwards bricks and blocks of stone cut in the form of bricks were\r\nused for this purpose, and in the latest period frequently brick and\r\nstone combined, _opus mixtum_ or _opus compositum_--a course of stone\r\nalternating with every two or three courses of brick. An example of\r\nthe _opus mixtum_ is seen in the entrances of the Herculaneum Gate\r\n(Fig. 113). Rubble work is the prevailing masonry at Pompeii; in\r\ncomparison the other kinds described may be considered exceptional.\r\n\r\nThe reticulate work, _opus reticulatum_, formed the outer surface of a\r\nwall, the inner part of which was built up with rubble. It was\r\ncomposed of small four-sided pyramidal blocks, of which only the base,\r\ncut square and smooth, showed on the surface; the tapering part served\r\nas a key to bind the block into the wall. These blocks, which measured\r\nfrom three to four inches square at the base, were laid on their\r\ncorners, so that the edges ran diagonally to the horizontal and\r\nvertical lines of the wall; the pattern thus formed had the appearance\r\nof a net, hence the name. The material was in most cases gray,\r\noccasionally yellow, tufa. The corners and doorposts were at first\r\nmade of the same kind of stone cut in the shape of bricks; later of\r\nbricks. This style of masonry was in vogue at Rome, and apparently\r\nalso at Pompeii, in the time of Augustus (Fig. 12; see also the\r\npedestal in the foreground of Plate I).\r\n\r\nThe quasi-reticulate work belongs to the early years of the Roman\r\ncolony. In appearance it lies between rubble and reticulate work,\r\ndiffering from the latter in that the small blocks are less carefully\r\nfinished and are laid with less regularity. The material is generally\r\nlava, but tufa and limestone are also found. The corners and doorposts\r\nare of brick, or of brick-shaped blocks of tufa or limestone (Fig.\r\n11).\r\n\r\nAshlar work, of carefully hewn oblong blocks laid in courses, is found\r\nin the older portions of the city wall (Fig. 109) and in the walls of\r\nthe Greek temple in the Forum Triangulare; it was used otherwise only\r\nfor the fronts of houses (Fig. 10). The material in the earliest times\r\nwas Sarno limestone, later gray tufa. With the coming of the Roman\r\ncolony ashlar work went out of use, even for the corners of houses and\r\ndoorposts.\r\n\r\nIn the construction of columns and many architraves large blocks were\r\nused. Previous to the time of the Roman colony these were of gray\r\ntufa, or, in rare instances, of limestone; a coating of white stucco\r\nwas laid on the surface. From the advent of the colony to the time of\r\nthe Early Empire, the whitish limestone was used; after that, Carrara\r\nmarble.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind the styles of construction just described, we may now\r\nturn to the architectural history of Pompeii, which, as we shall see,\r\nfalls naturally into six periods.\r\n\r\nThe first period is that to which the Doric temple in the Forum\r\nTriangulare and the city walls belong. From the style of the temple,\r\nwe may safely conclude that it was built in the sixth century B.C.;\r\nthe evidence is too scanty to enable us definitely to fix the date of\r\nthe walls. The building materials used were the Sarno limestone and\r\ngray tufa.\r\n\r\nThe second period may be designated as the Period of the Limestone\r\nAtriums, so characterized from the peculiar construction of a number\r\nof houses found in different parts of the city. On the side facing the\r\nstreet these houses have walls of ashlar work of Sarno limestone (Fig.\r\n10), but the inner walls are of limestone framework (Fig. 9).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 10.--Facade of Sarno limestone, house of the\r\n   Surgeon.]\r\n\r\nAlmost no ornamental forms belonging to this period have come down to\r\nus; so far only a single column has been found, built into the wall of\r\na house. It is of the Doric style, and once formed part of a portico\r\nthat ran along the west side of the small open space at the northwest\r\ncorner of Stabian and Nola streets; it is thus the sole remnant of a\r\npublic building. In the only complete house that has survived from\r\nthis period, the house of the Surgeon, there was a portico in front of\r\nthe garden, but the roof was supported by square pillars, not by\r\ncolumns. There is no trace of wall painting.\r\n\r\nCharacteristic as the construction of the limestone atriums is, it is\r\ndifficult to determine to what age they belong. The beginning of the\r\nperiod cannot be determined even approximately. The end, however, is\r\nfixed by the earlier limit of the next period, the Second Punic War.\r\nWe may, therefore, assign the houses with the limestone atriums to a\r\nperiod just preceding this war; reckoning in round numbers, they were\r\nbuilt before 200 B.C.\r\n\r\nIn the third, or Tufa Period, came the climax of the development of\r\nPompeian architecture prior to the Roman domination. The favorite\r\nbuilding material was the gray tufa.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Greek temple mentioned above, all the public\r\nbuildings of Pompeii that do not belong to the time of the Roman\r\ncolony have a homogeneous character; a list of them would include the\r\ncolonnade about the Forum, the Basilica, the temples of Apollo and of\r\nJupiter, the Large Theatre with the colonnades of the Forum\r\nTriangulare and the Barracks of the Gladiators, the Stabian Baths, the\r\nPalaestra, and the outer part of the Porta Marina with the inner parts\r\nof the other gates. Closely associated with these public edifices is a\r\nlarge number of private houses; as a specially characteristic example,\r\nwe may mention the house of the Faun.\r\n\r\nAll these buildings are similar in style and construction; they\r\nevidently date from a period of great building activity. It must also\r\nhave been a period of peace and prosperity; for the whole city, from\r\nthe artistic and monumental point of view, underwent a transformation.\r\nCertain Oscan inscriptions, an early Latin monumental inscription, and\r\na few words, dating from 78 B.C., scratched upon the plaster of the\r\nBasilica, oblige us to place the Tufa Period before the time of the\r\nRoman colony; yet not long before, for the next oldest buildings date\r\nfrom the first years of the colony. The time of peace that furnished\r\nthe background for the period can only have been that between the\r\nSecond Punic War and the Social War, about 200 to 90 B.C.; the Tufa\r\nPeriod was approximately the second century before Christ.\r\n\r\nIn marked contrast with the Period of the Limestone Atriums, the Tufa\r\nPeriod has a pronounced artistic character. It is preeminently a\r\nperiod of monumental construction. Buildings and public places are\r\nadorned with colonnades of the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders.\r\nThe simple and beautiful forms of the Greek architecture are used,\r\nsparingly indeed, but without petty detail and with evident fear of\r\nexcessive ornamentation. Columns and architraves are white, with only\r\nslight suggestion of the earlier Greek polychrome decoration. A\r\nvariety of color, however, is laid on the walls, and with this period\r\nthe history of Pompeian wall decoration begins.\r\n\r\nThe Tufa Period coincides throughout with the time of the first style\r\nof decoration. This, known as the Incrustation Style, aimed to imitate\r\nin stucco the appearance of a wall veneered with colored marbles. Wall\r\npaintings are wholly lacking, but pictures, often of rare beauty, are\r\nfound in the mosaics of the floors. In this period, we may truly say\r\nthat Pompeian architecture was at its best. With it the pure Greek\r\ntradition dies out; all the buildings of later times bear the Roman\r\nstamp.\r\n\r\nThe buildings of the Tufa Period are easily recognized by the\r\nunobtrusiveness of the materials used in their construction. The\r\nrubble work is mostly of lava; but gray tufa was used exclusively, not\r\nonly for ashlar work in facades, but also for columns and\r\nentablatures. The surface of the tufa was coated with a layer of fine\r\nwhite stucco, which gave it the appearance of marble. The use of\r\nmarble for building purposes, however, is foreign to this period; and\r\nit speaks well for the culture of the Oscan Pompeians that they had\r\npleasure in beauty of form above richness of material.\r\n\r\nThe fourth period covers the earlier decades of the Roman colony, from\r\n80 B.C. to near the end of the Republic. According to inscriptions\r\nwhich are still extant, soon after the year 80 a wealthy colonist,\r\nGaius Quinctius Valgus, when duumvir with Marcus Porcius as colleague,\r\nbuilt the Small Theatre, and afterwards, when quinquennial duumvir\r\nwith the same colleague, the Amphitheatre also. Both structures have\r\nthe quasi-reticulate facing (Fig. 11); and several other buildings in\r\nwhich the same style of masonry is found without doubt belong to the\r\nsame period--the Baths near the Forum, the temple of Zeus Milichius,\r\na building just inside the Porta Marina, and apparently the hall at\r\nthe southeast corner of the Forum, which we shall identify as the\r\nComitium; with these should be included also the original temple of\r\nIsis, which was destroyed by the earthquake of 63 A.D. Few houses\r\ndating from this period have been discovered; the provision made by\r\nthe preceding period in this respect had been so generous that new\r\nhouses were not needed.\r\n\r\nFrom the aesthetic point of view the fourth period falls far below\r\nthat just preceding; the exhaustion of resources and the decline of\r\ntaste due to the long and terrible war are unmistakable. Theatre,\r\nAmphitheatre, and Baths were alike built for immediate use, with crude\r\nand scanty ornamentation; and where richer ornament was applied, as in\r\nthe case of the temple of Isis, it could not for a moment be compared\r\nwith that of the Tufa Period in beauty and finish.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 11.--Quasi-reticulate facing, with brick corner,\r\n   at the entrance of the Small Theatre.]\r\n\r\nThe wall decoration of the fourth period is of the second Pompeian\r\nstyle, which came into vogue just after the founding of the colony,\r\nand which we shall call the Architectural Style; for in part, as the\r\nfirst style, it imitated a veneering of marble, not however with the\r\nhelp of slabs or panels modelled in stucco, but by the use of color\r\nonly, laid on walls finished to a plane surface; in part it made use\r\nof architectural designs which were painted either correctly or with\r\nat least some regard for proper proportions.\r\n\r\nThe fifth period extends from the last decades of the Republic to the\r\nearthquake of the year 63 A.D. In the entire period, covering more\r\nthan a century, we are unable to distinguish a series of buildings\r\nwhich may be classed together in style and construction as\r\nconstituting a homogeneous, representative group. Here and there we\r\ncan point out a piece of masonry which, from its similarity to that\r\nof the fourth period, may be assigned to the end of the Republic;\r\nagain, walls with reticulate facing of tufa and corners of\r\nbrick-shaped blocks of the same stone belong to the time of Augustus\r\n(Fig. 12), while reticulate work with corners of brick (Fig. 95) is of\r\nlater date; but there is a total lack of those distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics which would serve to set off by themselves all the\r\nbuildings belonging to a particular time. Consequently in the case of\r\neach structure it is necessary to take into account all the\r\ncircumstances, and then to form an independent judgment regarding its\r\nstyle and date.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 12.--Reticulate facing, with corners of\r\n   brick-shaped stone. The filled arch is probably to bear the weight of\r\n   the wall over a sewer.]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is further enhanced by the fact that three styles of\r\nwall decoration fall within the limits of the same period. The\r\nArchitectural Style, already mentioned, remained in vogue to the time\r\nof Augustus; it then gave place to the third or Ornate Style, which is\r\ncharacterized by a freer use of ornament and the introduction of\r\ndesigns and scenes suggestive of an Egyptian origin. The fourth or\r\nIntricate Style came in about the year 50 A.D., and represents, with\r\nits involved and fantastic designs, the last stage in the development\r\nof Pompeian wall decoration. In the fifth period marble began to be\r\nemployed as a building material; the earliest dated example of its use\r\nis the temple of Fortuna Augusta, erected about 3 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe sixteen years between the earthquake of 63 A.D. and the\r\ndestruction of the city form the sixth period in the architectural\r\nhistory of Pompeii. The buildings belonging to it can be easily\r\nrecognized, not only from their similarity in style and ornament, but\r\nalso from certain external characteristics, as newness of appearance,\r\nunfinished condition, and the joining of new to broken walls. The only\r\nimportant building wholly new is the large bathing establishment, the\r\nCentral Baths, at the corner of Stabian and Nola streets. For the\r\nrest, effort seems to have been directed toward restoring the ruined\r\nbuildings as nearly as possible to their original condition. The wall\r\ndecoration throughout is of the Intricate Style.\r\n\r\nThe measurements of buildings in the Roman Period conform to the scale\r\nof the Roman foot, while the dimensions of structures antedating the\r\nRoman colony in most cases reduce to the scale of the Oscan or old\r\nItalic foot. The Roman foot (296 mm.) may be roughly reckoned at 0.97\r\nof the English foot (304.8 mm.); the Oscan foot (275 mm.) is\r\nconsiderably shorter. As the Roman standard is of Greek origin, we may\r\nperhaps find a structure conforming to it that was designed by a Greek\r\narchitect before the Roman Period.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEY TO PLAN II\r\n\r\n     A.

Entering, we find ourselves near\r\nthe lower end of an oblong open space (Plate I), at the upper end of\r\nwhich, toward Vesuvius, stands a high platform of masonry with the\r\nruins of a temple--the temple of Jupiter; the remains of a colonnade\r\nare seen on each of the other three sides. Including the colonnade the\r\nForum measures approximately 497 feet in length by 156 in breadth;\r\nwithout it the dimensions are 467 and 126 feet. The north side, at the\r\nleft of the temple, is enclosed by a wall in which there are two\r\nopenings, one at the end of the colonnade, the other between this and\r\nthe temple; at the right the wall bounding the open space has been\r\nreplaced by a stately commemorative arch, while the end of the\r\ncolonnade is closed by a wall with a passageway. Another arch, of much\r\nsimpler construction, stands at the left of the temple, in line with\r\nthe facade; it cuts off the area between the temple and the colonnade\r\nfrom the rest of the Forum. A third arch once stood in a corresponding\r\nposition at the right.\r\n\r\nThe colonnade is nowhere intersected by a street passable for\r\nvehicles. Even the entrances on the north side form no exception. At\r\nthe left you descend to the area by several steps, at the right by one\r\nonly; yet here the exclusion of carts and wagons was made doubly sure\r\nby placing three upright stones in the passageway. Only pedestrians\r\ncould enter the Forum, and they, too, could easily be shut out by\r\nmeans of gates in the entrances; the places where the gates swung can\r\nstill be seen in the pavement, and one of them is shown in a painting\r\n(Fig. 16). No private houses opened on this area; it was wholly given\r\nup to the public life of the city and was surrounded by temples,\r\nmarkets, and buildings devoted to the civic administration.\r\n\r\nThe colonnade was not uniform in character upon all the three sides.\r\nAs will be seen from our plan (Plan II), on the south side, and on the\r\nadjoining portion of the east side as far as Abbondanza Street, it was\r\nconstructed with two rows of columns and had a double depth. On the\r\neast side, north of this street, the porticos in front of four\r\nsuccessive buildings (K, L, M, N) took its place. For the greater part\r\nof its extent the colonnade was built in two stories, the lower of the\r\nDoric, the upper of the Ionic order. The upper gallery was made\r\naccessible by three stairways, at the southeast and southwest corners\r\nof the Forum and at the middle of the west side; on the east side it\r\ndid not extend beyond Abbondanza Street.\r\n\r\nThe portico in front of the first of the four buildings referred to,\r\nthat of Eumachia, contained a double series of columns, one above the\r\nother, corresponding in style and dimensions with those of the\r\ncolonnade; but there was no upper floor running back from the\r\nintervening entablature. The arrangement in front of the fourth\r\nbuilding, the Macellum, was similar; as the remains of the porticos in\r\nfront of the two intervening buildings have wholly disappeared, it is\r\nimpossible to determine their character.\r\n\r\nThe area of the Forum was paved with rectangular flags of whitish\r\nlimestone. In front of the colonnade, the pavement of which was about\r\ntwenty inches above that of the open space, a broad step or ledge\r\nprojected, covering a gutter for rain water; the water found its way\r\ninto the gutter through semicircular openings in the outer edge of the\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nOf the many statues that once adorned the Forum not one has been\r\nfound. As may be seen from the pedestals still in place, they were of\r\nthree kinds, and varied greatly in size.\r\n\r\nFirst, statues of citizens who had rendered distinguished services\r\nwere placed in front of the colonnade on the ledge over the gutter.\r\nFour pedestals that once supported statues of this sort may be seen on\r\nthe west side.\r\n\r\nThen equestrian statues of life size were set up in front of the\r\nledge, these also in honor of dignitaries of the city (Fig. 17). On\r\none of the pedestals the veneering of colored marble is still\r\npreserved, with an inscription showing that the person represented was\r\nQuintus Sallustius, \"Duumvir, Quinquennial Duumvir, Patron of the\r\nColony.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, on the south side, the life size equestrian statues, which\r\nseem at the outset to have been arranged symmetrically, were almost\r\nall removed in order to make room for four much larger statues, the\r\npedestals of which still remain (Fig. 53, p. 122). These must have\r\nrepresented emperors, or members of the imperial families. The\r\npedestal in the middle, which is in the form of an arch almost square\r\nat the base, is much the oldest. Upon it was probably placed a\r\ncolossal statue of Augustus. It is incredible that during the long and\r\nsuccessful reign of the first emperor no statue in his honor should\r\nhave been erected in Pompeii; and this is the most suitable place. The\r\nother three pedestals are similar in construction, and clearly belong\r\ntogether. The one at the right (2 on the plan) supported a colossal\r\nequestrian statue; that at the left (3) a colossal standing figure; on\r\nthe third, further forward (4), was a smaller equestrian statue. Here\r\nstood, then, emperor, empress, and crown prince--Claudius, Agrippina,\r\nNero.\r\n\r\nA fifth pedestal, for an equestrian statue of the same size as that of\r\nNero, is seen further to the north, in front of the temple of Jupiter\r\n(5). While unquestionably later than the time of Augustus, it must on\r\nthe other hand be older than the pedestals of members of the Claudian\r\nfamily; for aside from himself, no one belonging to Nero's time can be\r\ntaken into consideration, and after his death the Forum lay in ruins\r\nin consequence of the earthquake of the year 63. Who stood here,\r\nhowever, can scarcely be even conjectured. Not necessarily an emperor;\r\nthe younger Drusus, for instance, Tiberius's son, or Germanicus might\r\nhave been thus honored if they had in any way come into relation with\r\nthe Pompeians. But if an emperor, it must have been Caligula; another\r\nplace was provided for the statue of Tiberius.\r\n\r\nIn the south side of the arch at the northeast corner of the Forum are\r\ntwo niches. It is highly probable that statues of the two oldest sons\r\nof Germanicus, Nero and Drusus, were placed in them; a fragment of an\r\ninscription referring to the former was found near by. These became\r\npresumptive heirs to the throne after the death of Tiberius's son\r\nDrusus, in 23 A.D.; but both afterwards fell victims to the morbid\r\nsuspicions of the emperor and the plots of Sejanus, Nero in 29 A.D.,\r\nDrusus four years later.\r\n\r\nOn the top of the arch an equestrian statue of Tiberius probably\r\nstood. That such a statue was placed here seems clear from analogy.\r\nNorth of this arch was another, almost in line with it, at the end of\r\nMercury Street where it opens into Nola Street; and here the\r\nexcavators found fragments of a bronze equestrian statue which were\r\nput together and set up in the Naples Museum. Whether this statue\r\nrepresented Caligula or Nero has been a matter of dispute, but the\r\nformer is really excluded from consideration by the short, heavy\r\nfigure, which is better suited to Nero. There is no decided\r\nresemblance to Nero either; but it is quite possible that, although as\r\ncrown prince he had been honored with a statue in the Forum, the\r\nPompeians thought it best to erect for him as emperor a more imposing\r\nmonument.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the area we may raise the question whether it contained\r\na speakers' platform, like the Rostra in the Roman Forum. If we have\r\nreference to a special structure, probably not; no trace of a separate\r\ntribunal has been discovered. The orator who wished to address the\r\npeople, however, could mount the broad platform in front of the temple\r\nof Jupiter, on which once an altar stood; before him the audience\r\ncould gather in the open, on the only side of the Forum free from the\r\ncolonnade. This place well suited the convenience of both speaker and\r\nhearers. It is possible that we should also identify as a tribune the\r\nplatform in a recess at the southeast corner (p. 120).\r\n\r\nOn even a cursory inspection the Forum is seen to lack unity in the\r\ndetails of its plan and in its architecture; the fact soon becomes\r\napparent that it reached its final form only as the result of a long\r\nperiod of development. It will be worth while briefly to trace this\r\ndevelopment, and to note at least the more important changes which\r\nfollowed one another in the course of the centuries.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest times the Forum was merely an open square bounded by\r\nfour streets.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 13.--North end of the Forum, with the Temple of\r\n   Jupiter, restored.]\r\n\r\nThe proof that this was the original form is in part based upon the\r\norientation of the temple of Apollo. The sides of this temple have the\r\nsame direction as the north and south streets in the northern part of\r\nthe city, and must have been laid out parallel with a street that once\r\nran between it and the Forum. The temple is, therefore, older than the\r\ncolonnade of the Forum, which shows a marked deviation from the line\r\nof its axis; the divergence, as may be seen on our plan, was in part\r\nconcealed by making a difference in the thickness of the pillars\r\nbetween the court of the temple and the Forum. It is obvious that the\r\ncolonnade on the west side takes the place of an older street; the\r\nsouth side was probably defined by the prolongation of Abbondanza\r\nStreet toward the southwest.\r\n\r\nNear the southeast corner an inscription was found: _V[ibius] Popidius\r\nEp[idii] f[ilius] q[uaestor] porticus faciendas coeravit_, 'Vibius\r\nPopidius, the son of Epidius, when quaestor caused this colonnade to\r\nbe erected.' No clew to the date is given, but it must have been\r\nbefore the coming of the Roman colony, for after that time there was\r\nno office of quaestor in Pompeii. It must also have been before the\r\nSocial War; in those years of tumult an extensive colonnade would not\r\nhave been built, and when the national spirit was so vehemently\r\nasserting itself, we should expect to find inscriptions upon public\r\nworks in the Oscan language, certainly not in Latin. But the use of\r\nLatin may very well date from the latter part of the period of\r\nalliance with Rome; we may then with much probability assign the\r\ninscription to the second half of the second century B.C.\r\n\r\nRemains of the colonnade of Popidius are still to be seen on the south\r\nside, and on the adjoining part of the east side, extending just\r\nacross Abbondanza Street; traces of it are found also on the west\r\nside, where it was afterward replaced by a new structure. On the east\r\nside north of Abbondanza Street no traces remain; the appearance of\r\nthis part of the Forum was entirely changed when the four buildings\r\n(K, L, M, N) with their porticos were erected, but we can hardly doubt\r\nthat the original colonnade extended here also. Our illustration (Fig.\r\n14) shows the arrangement of the Doric columns in the lower story; of\r\nthe Ionic columns above only scanty fragments have been recovered. The\r\nappearance of the whole may be suggested by our restoration (Fig. 13).\r\n\r\nIn style and construction this colonnade belongs to the Tufa Period\r\n(p. 40). While the forms are not those of the classical period, they\r\nnevertheless manifest Greek feeling. The low ratio in the proportions\r\nof the Doric columns, of which the height is equal to five diameters,\r\nwell accords with their use as a support for an upper gallery;\r\nelsewhere in pre-Roman Pompeii more slender proportions are preferred,\r\neven for the Doric style. The shaft is well shaped, with a moderate\r\nswelling (_entasis_). Only the upper part is fluted; as the sharp\r\nedges of the flutings near the bottom might easily be marred, the\r\ndivisions of the surface on the lower third of the shaft were left\r\nflat.\r\n\r\nThe architrave is relatively low, the result of an interesting\r\npeculiarity in the method of construction. Blocks of tufa long enough\r\nto span the intercolumniations were too weak to sustain the weight of\r\nthe rest of the entablature. To meet this difficulty a line of thick\r\nplanks was placed in old Italic fashion above the capitals of the\r\ncolumns, and on these were laid short tufa blocks. Thus in our\r\nillustration (Fig. 14), while the upper of the two bands of the\r\narchitrave is seen to be of stone, the lower shows the modern timber\r\nsupplied in the place of the ancient. That the planks were in reality\r\nno thicker than has been assumed in the reconstruction is proved\r\nbeyond question by the later colonnade on the west side, which,\r\nalthough entirely of stone, corresponds throughout in its proportions\r\nwith the older one; the architrave is equally narrow, and is likewise\r\ndivided into two parts.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 14.--Remnant of the colonnade of Popidius, at the\r\n   south end of the Forum.]\r\n\r\nThis explanation is curiously confirmed by an architectural painting\r\non the garden wall of one of the finest houses of the Tufa Period, the\r\nhouse of the Faun. Here we find pilasters and entablature, except the\r\narchitrave, painted white; but the architrave is painted in two\r\nbands, of which the lower is yellow, as if to represent wood. Nothing\r\nwould have been easier than to leave the architrave, moulded in\r\nstucco, of one color as if it were all of one material; but special\r\neffort was made apparently to indicate the appearance of a lower\r\ndivision of timber. From this we may infer that in actual construction\r\nno pains was taken to conceal the lack of uniformity in structural\r\nmaterials by laying a coat of white or colored stucco over wood and\r\nstone alike; on the contrary, the difference was not only recognized\r\nin the decoration, but even accentuated, as the timber, whether\r\nretaining its original color or painted with a suitable tint,\r\npresented a marked contrast with the stone the surface of which was\r\ncovered with white stucco. If the strip of timber in the architrave\r\nhad been perceptibly thicker than that of stone above it, the effect\r\nwould not have been good; as the earlier Greek polychrome decoration\r\nwas now no longer in vogue, the stripe of color above the capitals\r\nmade a pleasing variation from the prevailing whiteness of the\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nThe Basilica at the southwest corner and the temple of Jupiter both\r\nconform to the same variation from the direction of the early north\r\nand south street that we have noticed in the case of the colonnade of\r\nPopidius; they belong, therefore, to the same remodelling of the\r\nForum. It is quite possible that the erection of the temple, by\r\nlimiting the area of the Forum on the north side, caused its extension\r\ntoward the south beyond the earlier boundary. Originally the temple\r\nwas isolated, the north end of the Forum on either side being left\r\nopen; later, but still in the time of the Republic, a high boundary\r\nwall with passageways was built on both sides of it. Later still the\r\ntwo arches were erected in a line with its facade; afterwards, in the\r\ntime of Tiberius, the wall at the right of the temple was replaced by\r\nthe commemorative arch (I), and the smaller arch near the facade at\r\nthe right was removed in order that there might be an unimpeded view\r\nof the great arch from the area.\r\n\r\nThe colonnade of Popidius may have stood for more than a century; the\r\nnecessity of making thoroughgoing repairs no doubt became urgent. In\r\nthe meantime, however, the taste of the Pompeians had undergone a\r\nchange, and instead of repairing the old colonnade they began to\r\nreplace it by a new one, a part of which is shown in Fig. 15. Better\r\nmaterial, the whitish limestone, was used, and the construction was\r\nmore substantial; the blocks of the entablature were fitted together\r\nso as to form a flat arch. Though the new colonnade followed closely\r\nthe proportions of the old, effective details, such as the fluting of\r\nthe columns, and the triglyphs with the guttae underneath, were\r\nomitted. The refined sense of form characteristic of the earlier time\r\nwas no longer manifest; all is coarse and inartistic, the swelling on\r\nthe shafts of the columns, for example, being carried too high.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 15.--Part of the new colonnade, near the southwest\r\n   corner of the Forum.]\r\n\r\nThe new colonnade had a second story of the Ionic order, of the\r\ncolumns of which (though not of the entablature) considerable\r\nfragments have been found. The stylobate on which the columns rested\r\nwas renewed in limestone, and about the same time the Forum was paved\r\nand the ledge over the gutter was laid with flags of the same\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nThis second remodelling of the Forum commenced in the early years of\r\nthe Empire, the pavement having been laid before the pedestal of the\r\nmonument to Augustus was built. It was never carried to completion. On\r\nthe west side the new colonnade was almost finished when the\r\nearthquake of the year 63 threw it nearly all down. At the time of the\r\neruption only the columns at the south end of this side, which had\r\nsafely passed through the earthquake, were still standing with their\r\nentablature; they are shown in Fig. 15. The area was then strewn with\r\nblocks, which the stonecutters were engaged in making ready for the\r\nrebuilding.\r\n\r\nThe Forum of Pompeii, as of other ancient cities, was first of all a\r\nmarket place. Early in the morning the country folk gathered here with\r\nthe products of the farm; here all day long tradespeople of every sort\r\nexhibited their wares. In later times the pressure of business led to\r\nthe erection of separate buildings around the Forum to relieve the\r\ncongestion; such were the Macellum, used as a provision market; the\r\nEumachia building, erected to accommodate the clothing trade; the\r\nBasilica and the market house west of the temple of Jupiter, devoted\r\nto other branches of trade. Yet in a literal sense the Forum always\r\nremained the business centre of the city.\r\n\r\nIt served, too, as the favorite promenade and lounging place, where\r\nmen met to discuss matters of mutual interest, or to indulge in\r\ngossip. Here idlers loitered and plied busier men with questions\r\nregarding public affairs, makers and dealers came together to talk\r\nover and settle points of difference, and young people pursued their\r\nromantic adventures. He can best form an idea of this bustling,\r\nceaseless, varied activity who knows what the piazza means in the life\r\nof a modern Italian city, and stops to consider how much has been\r\ntaken from the life of the piazza by the cafes and similar places of\r\nresort; modern squares, moreover, are usually not provided, as were\r\nthe ancient, with inviting colonnades, affording protection against\r\nboth sun and rain.\r\n\r\nThe life of the Forum seemed so interesting to one of the citizens of\r\nPompeii that he devoted to the portrayal of it a series of paintings\r\non the walls of a room. The pictures are light and sketchy, but they\r\ngive a vivid representation of ancient life in a small city. First, in\r\nfront of the equestrian statues near the colonnade we see dealers of\r\nevery kind and description. There sits a seller of copper vessels and\r\niron utensils (Fig. 16), so lost in thought that a friend is calling\r\nhis attention to a possible purchaser who is just coming up. Next come\r\ntwo shoemakers, one waiting on women, another on men; then two cloth\r\ndealers. Further on a man is selling portions of warm food from a\r\nkettle; then we see a woman with fruit and vegetables, and a man\r\nselling bread. Another dealer in utensils is engaged in eager\r\nbargaining, while his son, squatting on the ground, mends a pot.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 16.--Scene in the Forum.\r\n\r\n   In the foreground, at the left, dealer in utensils; at the right,\r\n   shoemaker waiting on four ladies. Wall painting.]\r\n\r\nThe scenes now change. A man sitting with a writing tablet and stylus\r\nlistens closely to the words of another who stands near by; he reminds\r\nus of the scribes who, under the portico of the theatre of San Carlo,\r\nat Naples, write letters for those that have been denied the privilege\r\nof an education.\r\n\r\nThen come men wearing tunics, engaged in some transaction, in the\r\ncourse of which they seem to pass judgment on the contents of bottles\r\nwhich they hold in their hands; their business perhaps involves the\r\ntesting of wine. Beyond these, some men are taking a walk; a woman is\r\ngiving alms to a beggar; and two children play hide and seek around a\r\ncolumn. The following scene is not easy to understand, but apparently\r\nhas reference to some legal process; a woman leads a little girl with\r\na small tablet before her breast into the presence of two seated men\r\nwho wear the toga.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 17.--Scene in the Forum.\r\n\r\n   Citizens reading a public notice. Wall painting.]\r\n\r\nIn the next scene (Fig. 17) four men are reading a notice posted on a\r\nlong board, which is fastened to the pedestals of three equestrian\r\nstatues. The sketchy character of the painting is especially obvious\r\nin the representations of the horses, which are nevertheless lifelike.\r\nIt is also interesting to note that the heads of the men in these\r\nscenes are uncovered; in stormy weather pointed hoods (shown in a\r\ntavern scene, Fig. 234) were sometimes worn. The festoons suggest a\r\ntrimming of the colonnade for some festal occasion.\r\n\r\nThe last scene is from school life. A pupil is to receive a flogging.\r\nHe is mounted on the back of one of his schoolmates, while another\r\nholds him by the legs; a slave is about to lay on the lash, and the\r\nteacher stands near by with an air of composure. It would not be safe\r\nto infer from this, however, that there was a school in the Forum; the\r\ncolumns in this scene are different from those in the others and are\r\nfurther apart. Possibly a part of the small portico north of the court\r\nof the temple of Apollo was at one time let to a schoolmaster.\r\n\r\nThe most important religious festivals were celebrated in the Forum.\r\nHere naturally festal honors were paid to the highest of the gods--the\r\nwhole area enclosed by the colonnade was the court of his temple; but\r\nwe learn from an inscription, mentioned below, that celebrations were\r\nheld here in honor of Apollo also, whose temple adjoined the Forum,\r\nand was at first even more closely connected with it than in later\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nVitruvius informs us that in Greek towns the market place, _agora_,\r\nwas laid out in the form of a square (a statement which is not\r\nconfirmed by modern excavations), but that in the cities of Italy, on\r\naccount of the gladiatorial combats, the Forum should have an oblong\r\nshape, the breadth being two thirds of the length. The purpose in\r\ngiving a lengthened form to the Forum, as also to the Amphitheatre,\r\nwas no doubt to secure, at the middle of the sides, a greater number\r\nof good seats, from which a spectacle could be witnessed. In the\r\nPompeian Forum, as may be seen from the dimensions given at the\r\nbeginning of this chapter, the breadth is less than one third of the\r\nlength. However, there can be little doubt that gladiatorial\r\nexhibitions were frequently held there before the building of the\r\nAmphitheatre, which dates from the earlier years of the Roman colony.\r\nAfter this time the Forum was still used for games and contests of a\r\nless dangerous character.

Clodius Flaccus,\r\nwhich is now lost, but was copied by a scholar in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, tells us at length how in his first, and again in his second,\r\nduumvirate (he was duumvir for the third time in 3 B.C.), in\r\nconnection with the festival of Apollo, he not only gave gladiatorial\r\nexhibitions in the Amphitheatre, but also provided bullfights and\r\nother spectacles, as well as musical entertainments and pantomimes, in\r\nthe Forum.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Forum as a place for gladiatorial combats, Vitruvius\r\nadds that the spaces between the columns should be wide,--that the\r\nview of spectators might be as little as possible impeded,--and that\r\nthe upper story of the colonnade should be arranged with reference to\r\nthe collection of an admission fee. The latter suggestion is of\r\nspecial interest. As we know from other sources, at public games\r\ncertain places were reserved for the officials and for the friends of\r\nhim who gave the spectacle; others were free to the public, while for\r\nstill others an admission fee was charged. If the exhibition was held\r\nin a market place, with lower and upper colonnades, the former would\r\nbe open to the people; the latter in part reserved, in part accessible\r\non payment of the price of admission.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to know whether on such occasions at Pompeii\r\nthe gates of the Forum itself were shut, so that admission even to the\r\nfree space could be regulated; perhaps they were in earlier times\r\nwhen, as at Rome, slaves were forbidden to witness the games. However,\r\nCicero speaks of this time-honored regulation as in his day already a\r\nthing of the past; and so in Roman Pompeii the gates of the Forum may\r\nhave remained open even on the days of the games. Their most important\r\nuse was probably in connection with the voting.\r\n\r\nThe Forum had a part also in spectacles which were not presented\r\nthere. We are safe in assuming that, at least in the earlier times,\r\nwhenever a gladiatorial combat was given in the Amphitheatre, or a\r\nplay in the Theatre, the city officials, including especially the\r\nofficial providing the entertainment, formed in procession with their\r\nretinue and proceeded in festal attire to the place of amusement.\r\nThese processions could scarcely have formed anywhere else than in the\r\nForum, and thence they must have started out.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Forum was not accessible for vehicles suggests a\r\nsignificant point of difference between the festal processions of the\r\ncolony and those of the capital. In the latter, vehicles had a\r\nprominent place. Thus at Rome the official who gave the games in the\r\nCircus entered the edifice with his retinue in chariots in the\r\nimposing circus parade, _pompa circensis_, and a similar usage\r\nprevailed in the case of other processions; priests, too, and\r\npriestesses were on many occasions allowed to ride. But even in Rome\r\ncarriages were always considered a matter of luxury; and the municipal\r\nregulations promulgated by Caesar prohibited the use of vehicles,\r\nexcept those required for religious and civic processions, on the\r\nstreets of the city from sunrise till the tenth hour, that is, till\r\nfour o'clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nIn Pompeii, and without doubt also in other cities of Italy and the\r\nprovinces, the closing of the Forum to vehicles made it necessary that\r\nreligious and other processions should proceed on foot. We have no\r\nevidence of any exception to this rule. We ought perhaps to recognize\r\nin it one of those devices by means of which Rome maintained a\r\nposition of dignified superiority over the provincial towns; to her\r\nprocessions was allowed an element of display which to theirs was\r\ndenied. It was not permitted to name the two chief executive officers\r\nof a municipality consuls, though their functions, within limits,\r\ncorresponded with those of the consuls at Rome; nor could the city\r\ncouncil be called a senate, though the Roman writers did not hesitate\r\nto apply this term to corresponding bodies in states and cities\r\noutside of Rome's jurisdiction. For like reasons, it would seem that\r\non public occasions officials and priests of a provincial town were\r\nnot permitted, as were those in Rome, to ride. Was this humiliating\r\nrestriction laid upon the Pompeians when the Roman colony came, or\r\npreviously when the city was in name the ally of Rome, but in reality\r\nalready subject? The evidence is almost conclusive for the latter\r\nalternative; for the colonnade of Popidius, which as we have seen was\r\nerected in the period of autonomy, left no entrance for vehicles,\r\nthough in other ways it added greatly to the attractiveness and\r\nconvenience of the Forum as a place for civic and religious\r\ncelebrations.\r\n\r\nNo record of events has survived to help us form a picture of the\r\nForum as the seat of deliberative and judicial functions, the centre\r\nof the city's political life; yet stirring scenes present themselves\r\nto the imagination as we recall the critical periods in the history of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nIn the Forum, about 400 B.C., the valiant Samnite mountaineers, having\r\ntaken the city by storm, assembled and established their civic\r\norganization; here, in later times, without doubt amid conflicts\r\nsimilar to those at Rome, the polity was put to the test and underwent\r\ntransformation. Fierce enough the strifes may have been during the\r\nSamnite wars, and again in the time of Hannibal,--after the battle of\r\nCannae,--when the aristocrats who favored Rome contended with the\r\nnational party for the mastery. Here, on the platform in front of the\r\ntemple of Jupiter, the leaders of the national party stood in 90 B.C.,\r\nand with flaming words roused the people to revolt, to join the\r\nmovement which, starting in Asculum, had spread like wildfire over\r\nSouthern Italy.\r\n\r\nThen ten years of bloody war,--siege, campaigns, surrender,--and again\r\nthe scene changes. Roman soldiers stand thick in serried ranks upon\r\nthe area. They are the veterans of Sulla. An officer bearing a civil\r\ncommission, the nephew of the Dictator, appears before them. Standing\r\nin front of the temple of Jupiter, he makes a proclamation regarding\r\nthe founding and administration of the colony. The citizens crowd back\r\ntimidly into the colonnade. Many of the best of the Pompeians have\r\nfallen in battle; of the rest, a part at least will be dispossessed of\r\nhouse and home to make room for the intruders, whose arrogance they\r\nwill be compelled submissively to endure.\r\n\r\nThis is the last tragic act in the Pompeian Forum. After this time,\r\nthere will be disputes regarding the rights of the old residents and\r\nthe colonists, public questions of many kinds will call for\r\nsettlement; the elections will come each year, and the ardent southern\r\ntemperament may assert itself in violent scenes. Yet all these\r\ndisturbances will be only as the ripples on the surface; the depths\r\nwill remain undisturbed. The life of Pompeii has become an integral\r\npart of the life of the Roman world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n_GENERAL VIEW OF THE BUILDINGS ABOUT THE FORUM--THE TEMPLE OF JUPITER_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Forum was to the ancient city what the atrium was to the early\r\nItalic house; it was used for every purpose for which a special place\r\nwas not provided elsewhere. And as sleeping rooms, dining rooms, and\r\nstorerooms were grouped about the atrium and opened into it, so around\r\nthe Forum lay the edifices which served the requirements of the public\r\nlife,--the most important temples, the municipal buildings, and market\r\nhouses or exchanges for different branches of business.\r\n\r\nThree temples adjoined the Forum at Pompeii. In addition, there was a\r\nsanctuary of the City Lares; and the temples of Venus Pompeiana and\r\nFortuna Augusta were but a short distance away. These religious\r\nedifices are representative of the different periods in the history of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nIn very early times the Oscans of Pompeii received from the Greeks who\r\nhad settled on the coast the cult of Apollo, and built for the\r\nHellenic god a large, fine temple (C, in Plan II) adjoining the Forum\r\non the west side.\r\n\r\nSeveral centuries later, the divinities of the Capitol--Jupiter, Juno,\r\nand Minerva--were enthroned in the temple that on the north side\r\ntowered above the area (H).\r\n\r\nOn the east or right side followed, in Roman times, the edifices\r\nerected for the worship of the emperors. The oldest is the unroofed\r\nbuilding, with a broad, open front, dedicated to the Lares of the City\r\nand to the Genius of Augustus (L). Further north, in the first block\r\nat the right beyond the Forum, is the temple of Fortuna Augusta, the\r\ngoddess who guarded the fortunes of Augustus, erected in 3 B.C. A\r\nchapel for the worship of Claudius and his family was placed in the\r\nMacellum (K, 5); this seems to have sufficed also for the worship of\r\nNero. After Nero's death and after the brief Civil War, a temple (M)\r\nwas built close to the shrine of the Lares in honor of Vespasian, the\r\nrestorer of peace, the new Augustus. This was the last temple erected\r\nin Pompeii; it was not entirely finished at the time of the eruption.\r\n\r\nThree buildings at the south end of the Forum were used for city\r\noffices (P-R). They were much alike, each containing a single large\r\nhall. They were seemingly built in the early years of the Empire, and\r\nrepaired after the earthquake of the year 63. There is also a\r\nstructure at the southeast corner, south of Abbondanza Street, which\r\nwe may identify as the voting place, the Comitium (O). At the\r\nnorthwest corner was apparently the city treasury, built in the latest\r\nyears of Pompeii, perhaps on the site of an earlier structure of the\r\nsame kind (F).\r\n\r\nAt a comparatively early period the area was found to be too small for\r\nthe increasing volume of business; and the demand for roofed space\r\nmade itself felt. In the second century B.C. the large and splendid\r\nBasilica (B), serving the double purpose of a court and an exchange,\r\nwas built at the southwest corner.\r\n\r\nDiagonally opposite, near the temple of Jupiter, a provision market,\r\nthe Macellum (K), was constructed; this also at an early date. It was\r\nentirely rebuilt in the time of the Empire, perhaps in the reign of\r\nClaudius. Previous to this rebuilding, the priestess Eumachia had\r\nerected an exchange for the fullers on the same side of the Forum,\r\nfurther south (N).\r\n\r\nOn the west side, from pre-Roman times, stood a small colonnade in two\r\nstories, with its rear against the rear of the colonnade on the north\r\nside of the court of the temple of Apollo; only the first story, of\r\nthe Doric order, has been preserved. Probably this structure and the\r\nsmall open space in front were at first used as a market; later, in\r\nthe imperial period, shops (D') were built upon the open space, and\r\nthe colonnade was made over into closed rooms, the purpose of which,\r\nexcept in the case of one, is unknown (6, 7, 7). In the last years of\r\nthe city, a large market building (D) was erected between this small\r\nplace and the Forum. It was connected both with the city treasury and\r\nwith a latrina.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe temple of Jupiter dominates the Forum, and more than any other\r\nstructure gives it character. As we have seen, its orientation accords\r\nwith that of the colonnade of Popidius. It probably dates from the\r\npre-Roman period, the columns being of tufa covered with white stucco.\r\nThe earthquake of the year 63 left the temple in ruins, and at the\r\ntime of the eruption the work of rebuilding had not yet commenced. In\r\nthe meantime, it was used as a workshop for stonecutters. The journal\r\nof the excavations reports the finding here of the torso of a colossal\r\nstatue out of which a smaller statue was being carved. A place for the\r\nworship of the divinities of the temple must temporarily have been\r\nprovided elsewhere.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 18.--Plan of the temple of Jupiter.\r\n\r\n     1. Speaker's platform.\r\n     2. Portico.\r\n     3. Cella.]\r\n\r\nThe temple stands on a podium 10 Roman feet high, and including the\r\nsteps, 125 Roman feet long (Fig. 18). Very nearly a half of the whole\r\nlength is given to the cella; of the other half, a little more than\r\ntwo thirds is occupied by the portico, leaving about a third (20 Roman\r\nfeet) for the steps. The pediment was sustained by six Corinthian\r\ncolumns about 28 feet high. This arrangement--a deep portico in front\r\nof the cella--is Etruscan, though the canon of Vitruvius, that in\r\nEtruscan temples the depth of the portico should equal that of the\r\ncella, is violated. The high podium also, with steps in front, is\r\ncharacteristic of Etruscan, or at least of early Italic religious\r\narchitecture. On the other hand, the architectural forms of the\r\nsuperstructure are Greek, and these in turn have had their influence\r\nupon the plan; the intercolumniations are not wide, as in the Tuscan\r\nstyle with its wooden architrave, but narrower, as in the Greek\r\norders. Vitruvius speaks of temples such as this, in which Greek and\r\nEtruscan elements are united, at the end of his directions for the\r\nbuilding of temples; they are a development of Roman architecture.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the steps is peculiar. Above is a series of long\r\nsteps reaching nearly across the front (Fig. 19); below are two narrow\r\nflights near the sides, and between them is the projecting front of\r\nthe podium, used as a tribune, which has already been mentioned (p.\r\n48).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 19.--Ruins of the temple of Jupiter.]\r\n\r\nThat an altar stood at the middle of this platform is proved by a\r\nrelief with a representation of the north side of the Forum, found on\r\nthe base of a chapel of the Lares in the house of the wealthy\r\nPompeian, L. Caecilius Jucundus. At the left we see the arch near the\r\nfacade and a strip of wall connecting it with the temple; next a\r\ncorner of the platform with an equestrian statue; then a flight of\r\nsteps, and the front of the platform with an altar at the middle;\r\nfinally the other flight of steps and another equestrian statue in a\r\nposition corresponding with that of the first. The columns shown in\r\nthe relief do not agree in number or style with those of the facade of\r\nthe temple, but such inaccuracies are common in ancient\r\nrepresentations of buildings, and there can be no doubt that the\r\ntemple of Jupiter is represented; the relief has, in fact, been used\r\nin making our restoration of the arch at the left (Fig. 13).\r\n\r\nBoth the portico and the cella no doubt had a coffered ceiling. Just\r\nin front of the doorway, which was fifteen Roman feet wide, are the\r\nlarge stones with holes for the pivots on which the massive double\r\ndoors swung (indicated in Fig. 18); the doors here were not placed in\r\nthe doorway, but in front of it, and were besides somewhat larger, so\r\nthat the effect was rendered more imposing when they were shut.\r\n\r\nThe ornamentation of the cella was especially rich. A row of Ionic\r\ncolumns, about fifteen feet high, stood in front of each of the longer\r\nsides; the entablature above them probably served as a base for a\r\nsimilar row of Corinthian columns, the entablature of which in turn\r\nsupported the ceiling. On the intermediate entablature, between the\r\ncolumns of the upper series, statues and votive offerings were\r\ndoubtless placed. The floor about the sides was covered with white\r\nmosaic, of which scanty remains have been found; the marble pavement\r\nof the centre (inside of the dotted line, Fig. 18) has wholly\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 20.--Section of the wall decoration in the cella\r\n   of the temple of Jupiter.]\r\n\r\nA section of the wall decoration, in the second Pompeian style, is\r\nshown in Fig. 20. We notice here the characteristic elements--imitation\r\nof marble veneering, with large red central panels and a cornice\r\nabove. The base with its simple dividing lines upon a black ground was\r\npainted over in the third style; originally it must have been more\r\nsuggestive of real construction, with a narrow painted border along\r\nthe upper edge.\r\n\r\nAgainst the rear wall of the cella stands a large pedestal, three\r\ntimes as long as it is broad. It was originally divided by four\r\npilasters--two at the corners and two on the front between them--into\r\nthree parts. Later the pilasters and the entablature over them were\r\nremoved, and the whole was covered with marble veneering. Inside were\r\nthree small rooms, entered by separate doors from the cella. The\r\npedestal was thus built for three images; three divinities were\r\nworshipped here, and in the little chambers underneath were perhaps\r\nkept the trappings with which on festal occasions the images were\r\ndecked.\r\n\r\nA head of Jupiter, of which we shall speak later, was found in the\r\ncella, as was also an inscription of the year 37 A.D., containing a\r\ndedication to Jupiter Optimus Maximus, the ruling deity of the Capitol\r\nat Rome. It is thus proved beyond question that the Capitoline Jupiter\r\nwas worshipped here; and it will not be difficult to ascertain what\r\nother divinities shared with him the honors of the temple.\r\n\r\nAs the Roman colonies strove in all things to be Rome in miniature,\r\neach thought it necessary to have a Capitolium--a temple for the\r\nworship of the gods of the Roman Capitol, Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva;\r\nand this naturally became the most important temple in the city. That\r\nthe worship of the three divinities was established at Pompeii is\r\nevident from the discovery of three images representing them, in the\r\nlittle temple conjecturally assigned to Zeus Milichius. These are poor\r\nimages of terra cotta, and the temple itself was altogether unworthy\r\nto be a place of worship for the great gods that shaped the destinies\r\nof Rome. We are warranted in the conclusion that the temple of Zeus\r\nMilichius was used temporarily for the worship of the three divinities\r\nof the large temple till the latter could be rebuilt; and that Juno\r\nand Minerva stood on the great pedestal beside the king of the gods.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that the Pompeians should have erected a temple to\r\nthe gods of the Capitol in the pre-Roman period. It must be\r\nremembered, however, that the worship of the three divinities was by\r\nno means limited to Rome and her colonies. The Etruscans, as Servius\r\ninforms us in his commentary on Virgil, thought that a city was not\r\nproperly founded unless it contained sanctuaries of Jupiter, Juno, and\r\nMinerva. Vitruvius, also, in his directions for laying out a city,\r\nmakes the general statement that the most prominent site should be set\r\naside for the temples of the same divinities. If we consider further\r\nthat the opposition of the Italians to Rome found expression only in\r\nthe Social War, and that previously they had looked upon the\r\nattainment of Roman citizenship as the highest object of ambition, the\r\ngradual adoption of Roman customs at Pompeii and the erection of a\r\ntemple to the Capitoline divinities are seen to be less remarkable.\r\nThe building of such a temple was a natural expression of political\r\naspirations; it was in complete harmony with the use of Latin in the\r\ninscription of Popidius (p. 50).\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another possibility that may be stated. The\r\nremodelling of the Forum was certainly commenced in the pre-Roman\r\nperiod; but it is not impossible that the work was interrupted by the\r\nbreaking out of the Social War and that the colonists completed it,\r\ndedicating the temple to the gods of the Capitol. The use of several\r\nbrick-shaped blocks of stone,--such blocks are not found in other\r\nbuildings of the pre-Roman time,--the lack of any trace of the wall\r\ndecoration of the first style, the form of the egg-and-dart moulding\r\non the capitals of the Ionic columns in the cella, and the\r\ncorrespondence of certain dimensions with the Roman scale of\r\nmeasurements may be alleged in favor of this hypothesis. The evidence\r\nat present does not warrant a positive decision against it.\r\n\r\nThe fact that we have here a Capitolium may explain the special\r\nprominence of the altar in front, which might just as well have been\r\nplaced in the area of the Forum at the foot of the steps. In Rome the\r\nCapitol lay upon a summit of a hill; perhaps the aim in this case was\r\nto place not only the temple but also the altar upon an elevation so\r\nthat here, as there, the priest should go up to offer sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe podium of the temple contains vaulted rooms which can be entered\r\nfrom the Forum through a narrow door on the east side. Their use is\r\nunknown. We are reminded of the temple of Saturn in the Forum at Rome,\r\nthe podium of which served as a treasury, _aerarium_. The vaults,\r\n_favissae_, may have been used as a place of safe keeping for\r\ntreasure, or for furniture of the temple, or for discarded votive\r\nofferings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe beautiful head of Jupiter found in the cella deserves more than a\r\npassing mention. In order to appreciate its character we may view it\r\nin contrast with the Otricoli Zeus, with which it is closely related.\r\nIn both heads we feel the lack of that majestic simplicity, that\r\nineffable and godlike calm, which rested on the features of the Zeus\r\nof Phidias. Here man has much more obviously made God in his own\r\nimage; the face shows less of the ideal, with more of human energy and\r\npassion.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 21.--Bust of Zeus from Otricoli, now in the\r\n   Vatican Museum. After Tafel 130 of the Brunn-Bruckmann Denkmaeler.]\r\n\r\nIt is not for us to decide whether the Otricoli mask is from the\r\nschool of Praxiteles, or shows more of the influence of Lysippus; it\r\nis sufficient here to notice that the type was developed in the second\r\nhalf of the fourth century B.C., the century after Phidias. The\r\nsimilarity between these two examples of the type is apparent at first\r\nglance. The shape of the two heads is, in general, the same, and there\r\nis the same profusion of hair and beard, symbolic of power; but the\r\ndifferences in detail are striking.\r\n\r\nIn the Otricoli Zeus the peculiar shape of the forehead--prominent in\r\nthe middle up to the roots of the hair and retreating at the\r\nsides--seems to suggest, not so much the power of a world-encompassing\r\nand lofty intellect, as absorption in great, unfathomable thoughts. In\r\nthe lines of the massive face irresistible force of will is revealed,\r\nand the capability of fierce passion lurks beneath the projecting\r\nlower part of the forehead and uneven eyebrows, threatening like a\r\nthundercloud. But for the moment all is deep repose, and the lids seem\r\npartly closed over eyes that look downwards, as if not concerned with\r\nseeing. The sculptor has conceived of Zeus as the occult power of\r\nnature, alike the origin and law of all things, or as the\r\npersonification of the heavens veiled by impenetrable mists.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 22.--Bust of Jupiter found at Pompeii. Naples\r\n   Museum.]\r\n\r\nGreat force of will is seen also in the face of the Pompeian god; but\r\nit is will dominated by alert and all-embracing mind. The forehead\r\nexpands in a broad arch; the eyes, wide open, look out with full\r\nvision under sharply cut brows. Here we have no secret brooding; a\r\npowerful yet clearly defined and comprehensible personality is stamped\r\nupon features carved in bold, free lines. And this personality is not\r\nlost in mystical self-contemplation; the god is following with closest\r\nattention the course of events in some far distant place, affairs that\r\nin the next moment may require his intervention; excitement and\r\nexpectancy are seen in the raised upper lip. The ideal of this artist\r\nwas the wise and powerful king, whose watchful and all-protecting eye\r\nsees to the furthest limits of his kingdom. Surely this variation of\r\nthe Otricoli type must have been conceived in a monarchical period,\r\nthe period when the Greek world was ruled by the successors of\r\nAlexander.\r\n\r\nThe Pompeian god is more a sovereign; the Zeus of Otricoli is more\r\npoetic, more divine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n_THE BASILICA_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Basilica, at the southwest corner of the Forum, was the most\r\nmagnificent and architecturally the most interesting building at\r\nPompeii. Its construction and decoration point to the pre-Roman time;\r\nand there is also an inscription scratched on the stucco of the wall,\r\ndating from almost the beginning of the Roman colony: _C. Pumidius\r\nDipilus heic fuit a. d. v. nonas Octobreis M. Lepid. Q. Catul.\r\ncos._,--'C. Pumidius Dipilus was here on the fifth day before the\r\nnones of October in the consulship of Marcus Lepidus and Quintus\r\nCatulus,' that is October 3, 78 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the building is clearly indicated not only by its plan\r\nand the details of its arrangement but also by the word _Bassilica_\r\nscratched a number of times by idlers on the stucco of the outer wall\r\nat the right of the south entrance. This sure identification lends to\r\nthe edifice a special significance; it is without doubt the oldest\r\nexample that we have of an important architectural type whose origin\r\nis lost in obscurity, but of which the derivative forms may still be\r\nrecognized in the architecture of to-day. What the temple developed by\r\nthe Greeks was to pagan antiquity, that the basilica became to the\r\nChristian Church--a type dominating a system of religious\r\narchitecture. Pagan worship was individual,--a narrow chamber sufficed\r\nfor the image of the god and the requirements of religious service;\r\nbut Christian worship was social, and its functions demanded a larger\r\nroom, in which a congregation could be assembled. The religious\r\narchitecture of the Church therefore broke with the religious\r\narchitecture of pagan antiquity, and turned for its model to the\r\nbasilica.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the history of the basilica begins with the erection\r\nof the Basilica Porcia in Rome by Cato the Elder, in 184 B.C.; other\r\nbasilicas followed, and in Caesar's day a number stood about the\r\nForum. Regarding its development prior to the time of Cato only\r\nconjectures can be offered. The name _basilica_ (_basilike stoa_, 'the\r\nroyal hall') points to a Greek origin; we should naturally look for\r\nthe prototype of the Roman as well as the Pompeian structure in the\r\ncapitals of the Alexandrian period and in the Greek colonies of Italy.\r\nBut no ruin, no reference in literature comes to our aid. The\r\nsupposition that the King's Hall (_basileios stoa_) in Athens, the\r\nofficial residence of the King Archon, was the prototype of all\r\nbasilicas, has little to support it; our information in regard to the\r\nform of this building is quite inadequate, and the name alone warrants\r\nno positive conclusion. It is more probable that both the name and the\r\narchitectural type came from the 'royal hall' of one of the successors\r\nof Alexander.\r\n\r\nA basilica was a spacious hall which served as an extension of a\r\nmarket place, and was itself in a certain sense a covered market. It\r\nwas not limited to a specific purpose; in general, whatever took place\r\non the market square might take place in the basilica, the roof of\r\nwhich afforded protection against the weather. It was chiefly devoted,\r\nhowever, to business transactions and to the administration of\r\njustice. The form is known partly from the remains of the basilicas in\r\nRome--Basilica Julia, Basilica Ulpia, the Basilica of Constantine--and\r\nin Africa, but more fully from the treatise of Vitruvius and the\r\ndescription of a basilica which he himself erected at Fano.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 23.--Plan of the Basilica.\r\n\r\n     _a._ Entrance court.\r\n     1. Corridor.\r\n     2. Main room.\r\n     3. Tribunal.\r\n     4. Rooms at the ends of the tribunal.]\r\n\r\nAccording to these sources the plan of a typical basilica is\r\nessentially that of the building before us (Fig. 23). An oblong space\r\nis divided by columns into a broad central hall and a corridor which\r\nruns around the four sides. The height of the columns, in the typical\r\nbasilica, is equal to the width of the corridor, which is covered by a\r\nflat roof; the inner edge of this roof is carried by the entablature\r\nabove the columns. The main room is higher than the corridor. Above\r\nthe entablature is a low wall on which there is a second row of\r\ncolumns; these carry the main roof and form a clerestory, the light\r\nbeing admitted through the intercolumniations.\r\n\r\nThe main hall and the corridor were devoted to trade; the dealers\r\nperhaps occupied the former, while in the latter the throng of\r\npurchasers and idlers moved freely about. The place set aside for the\r\nadministration of justice, the tribunal, was ordinarily an apse\r\nprojecting from the rear end. In our Basilica, however,--and in some\r\nothers as well,--it was a small oblong elevated room back of the\r\ncentral hall, toward which it opened in its whole length.\r\n\r\nThis ideal plan would answer very well for that of the early Christian\r\nbasilicas, excepting in one respect; instead of a corridor on all four\r\nsides they have only aisles parallel with the nave, an arrangement\r\nwhich had already been adopted in some basilicas designed for markets.\r\nThe Christian basilicas would give us a still truer idea of the\r\narrangement and lighting of the pagan prototype if in most cases a\r\npart of the numerous windows had not been walled up, thus producing a\r\ndimness in keeping with a religious but not a secular edifice.\r\n\r\nIn pagan structures the ideal plan was by no means strictly followed.\r\nVitruvius himself at Fano, and the architects of other basilicas the\r\nremains of which have been discovered, did not hesitate to depart from\r\nit. So the Basilica at Pompeii, as we shall see, presents a\r\nmodification of the general plan in an important particular, the\r\nadmission of light; and this deviation was carried out with finer\r\nartistic feeling than was displayed by Vitruvius in his building.\r\n\r\nOur Basilica is undoubtedly of later date than the Basilica Porcia,\r\nbut the Pompeians, who at the time when it was built were pupils of\r\nthe Greeks in matters of art, found their model not in Rome but in a\r\nGreek city, perhaps Naples.\r\n\r\nFive entrances, separated by tufa pillars, lead from the colonnade of\r\nthe Forum into the east end of the basilica. First comes a narrow\r\nentrance court (_a_), extending across the entire building and open to\r\nthe sky. On the walls, as also on the outside of the building, are\r\nremains of a simple stucco decoration; below, a yellow base with a\r\nprojecting red border along the upper edge; above, a plain white\r\nsurface. At the left outside the entrance court is a cistern for rain\r\nwater collected from the roof; the stairway close by (shown on the\r\nplan) had nothing to do with the Basilica, but was connected with the\r\nupper gallery of the colonnade about the Forum.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 24.--View of the Basilica, looking toward the\r\n   tribunal.]\r\n\r\nMounting four steps of basalt we pass from the narrow court into the\r\nbuilding. The five entrances here are separated by four columns. Those\r\nnext to the two sides on the right and on the left were closed by a\r\nwall in which was a wide doorway; the three at the middle were left as\r\nopen intercolumniations. The enclosed space before us measures 180-1/3\r\nEnglish feet (200 Oscan feet) in length, 78-3/4 feet in breadth.\r\nTwenty-eight massive brick columns, 4 Oscan feet in diameter, separate\r\nthe great central hall from the broad corridor running about it; only\r\nthe lower part of the columns, built of small bricks evidently made\r\nspecially for this purpose, is preserved (Fig. 24). Attached\r\nhalf-columns, with a diameter a little more than three fourths that of\r\nthe others, project from the walls; the wall decoration, which\r\nimitates in stucco a veneering of colored marbles, is of the first\r\nstyle (p. 41). The columns of the entrance and those at the rear have\r\nthe same diameter as the half-columns; part of the Ionic capitals\r\nbelonging to them have been found, but the capitals of the large\r\ncolumns have wholly disappeared.\r\n\r\nThere are only scanty remains of the floor, which consisted of bits of\r\nbrick and tile mixed with fine mortar and pounded down (_opus\r\nSigninum_); it extended in a single level over the whole enclosed\r\nspace, and from this level our estimates of height are reckoned. On\r\nthree sides of the main hall near the base of the columns under the\r\nfloor is a square water channel, indicated on our plan; eight\r\nrectangular basins lie along its course, but the purpose of it is not\r\nclear. The tribunal projects from the rear wall, its floor being six\r\nOscan feet above that of the rest of the building.\r\n\r\nThe large columns about the main hall, with a diameter of more than 31/2\r\nfeet, must have been at least 32 or 33 feet high; the attached\r\nhalf-columns with the columns at the entrance and at the rear,\r\nincluding the Ionic capitals, were probably not more than 20 feet\r\nhigh. But assuming that the roof of the corridor was flat, the walls\r\nmust have been as high as the entablature of the large columns, and so\r\nmust have extended above the entablature of the half-columns;\r\nconsiderable portions of this upper division of the walls remain.\r\n\r\nAlong the walls on the ground are to be seen a number of capitals,\r\nfragments of shafts and bases belonging to a series of smaller columns\r\nwith a diameter of 1.74 feet, all found in the course of the\r\nexcavations. They are of tufa, coated with white stucco; they can\r\nbelong only here, and by the study of their forms--columns,\r\nhalf-columns, and peculiarly shaped three-quarter-columns--the upper\r\ndivision of the walls can be restored with some degree of certainty.\r\nNot to go into technical details, in the upper part of the side walls\r\na section of wall containing a window alternated with a short series\r\nof columns in which the columns, for the sake of greater solidity,\r\nwere set twice as close as the half-columns in the lower division of\r\nthe wall, the intercolumniations being left entirely open (Fig. 25);\r\nover the entrances at the front the wall was continuous but was\r\ndivided into sections by half-columns corresponding with the columns\r\nbelow, a window being placed between every two half-columns in order\r\nto conceal the difference in width between the sections of wall at the\r\nfront and those at the sides. The arrangement was similar at the rear,\r\non either side of the tribunal, as may be seen from the section (Fig.\r\n27).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 25.--Exterior of the Basilica, restored.]\r\n\r\nWith this restoration of the outer walls completed we are able to form\r\na clear idea of the appearance of the main hall. Whether or not the\r\nrafters could be seen from below is uncertain, but the probability is\r\nthat, as assumed in our restoration (Fig. 26), they were hidden by a\r\ncoffered ceiling. The simple and beautiful interior abounded in fine\r\nspatial effects. The corridor and main room were almost as high as the\r\nmain room was wide, that is between 35 and 40 feet. The light\r\nstreaming in through the openings in the upper portion of the walls\r\nwas evenly distributed throughout the hall; we may assume that when\r\nthe sun became too hot on the south side it could be shut out by\r\ncurtains.\r\n\r\nIn our Basilica, then, we notice a wide divergence from the ideal or\r\nnormal plan. Instead of a clerestory above the main hall a\r\nproportionally greater height is given to the corridor. The normal\r\nheight of a basilica corridor is represented by the lower division of\r\nthe walls with the attached half-columns and their entablature; this,\r\nhowever, is here treated simply as a lower member, and upon it, rather\r\nthan upon the entablature of the columns about the main hall, was\r\nplaced an upper division of wall admitting light and air through\r\nintercolumniations and windows.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 26.--Interior of the Basilica, looking toward the\r\n   tribunal, restored.]\r\n\r\nThe tribunal at the rear is the most prominent and architecturally the\r\nmost effective portion of the building. The base is treated in a bold,\r\nsimple manner; upon it, at the front, stands a row of columns the\r\nlower portions of which show traces of latticework. The decoration of\r\nthe walls, like that of the rest of the interior, imitates a veneering\r\nof colored marbles. The shape and comparatively narrow dimensions of\r\nthe elevated room indicate that we have here a tribunal in the strict\r\nsense, a raised platform for the judge and his assistants; in the\r\nbasilicas provided with apses the latter were large enough to make\r\nroom both for the judicial body and for the litigants. Here the\r\nlitigants stood on the floor in front of the tribunal, and when court\r\nwas in session the general public must have been excluded from this\r\npart of the corridor. The arrangement in this respect was far from\r\nconvenient, but seemingly convenience was sacrificed to aesthetic\r\nconsiderations; the builders wished to treat the projecting front of\r\nthe tribunal as an ornament to the building.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 27.--Front of the tribunal--plan and elevation.]\r\n\r\nUnder the tribunal was a vaulted chamber half below the level of the\r\nground; two round holes, indicated on the plan, opened into it from\r\nabove. It could hardly have been designed as a place for the\r\nconfinement of prisoners; escape would have been easy by means of two\r\nwindows in the rear, especially when help was rendered from the\r\noutside. More likely it was used, in connection with the business of\r\nthe court, as a storeroom, in which writing materials and the like, or\r\neven documents, might be kept; they could easily have been passed up\r\nthrough the holes when needed. The second story of the tribunal was\r\nnot as completely open to the main hall as the first. Its front, the\r\nremains of which have for the most part been recovered, was divided\r\noff by half-columns corresponding in number and arrangement with the\r\ncolumns of the first story, but each half-column was flanked by narrow\r\npilasters, while a parapet of moderate height occupied the intervening\r\nspaces. It was built apparently with a view to architectural effect\r\nrather than practical use (Fig. 27).\r\n\r\nAt the right and the left of the tribunal are places for stairways.\r\nEach of these contains a landing on the same level with the floor of\r\nthe tribunal, from which it was cut off by a door; the steps\r\nconnecting with these landings, being of wood, have disappeared. In\r\nboth stair rooms, however, flights of stone steps lead down to the\r\nvaulted chamber below, so that this could not have been accessible if\r\nthere were wooden steps on both sides connecting the tribunal with the\r\nfloor of the Basilica. Probably on one side the wooden steps led from\r\nthe tribunal down to the floor, but on the other ascended from the\r\ncorresponding landing to the second story, thus leaving the stairway\r\nto the lower room unobstructed on that side. At some later time the\r\ndoor at the left between the tribunal and the landing was walled up,\r\nperhaps because the gallery was no longer used; if still in use it\r\ncould to all appearances have been reached only by a ladder.\r\n\r\nThe two open rooms at the rear on either side of the tribunal agree in\r\ntheir decoration with the entrance court except that the base with its\r\nborder is higher, and the white surface above is moulded in stucco so\r\nas to give the appearance of slabs of white marble. They were no\r\nhigher than the first division of the wall; the windows seen in Fig.\r\n27 above the broad entrances opened into the outer air. Perhaps they\r\nwere used as waiting rooms for litigants.\r\n\r\nOpposite the north entrance between two columns stood a curb like\r\nthose over the mouths of cisterns; only the foundation stone with a\r\ncircular opening is preserved. The remains of a lead pipe, which\r\nbrought the water to it, show that it must have been connected with an\r\naqueduct. At the further end of the main hall was an equestrian statue\r\nof which no trace has been found.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the roof is a problem of much difficulty. Without\r\nwearying the reader by presenting various possibilities, it will be\r\nsufficient for our purposes to suggest the explanation which, on the\r\nwhole, has the most in its favor. As assumed in our restoration, the\r\nroof of the main hall was carried by the entablature of the\r\ntwenty-eight large columns. Thus in general the arrangement\r\ncorresponded fairly well with that of other basilicas except that,\r\nowing to the lack of a clerestory, the roof of the main hall was not\r\nmuch if any higher than that of the corridor. From the flat roof of\r\nthe corridor, at least on the south side, the rain water flowed into\r\nthe cistern near the front part of the building.\r\n\r\nThe five entrances opening from the Forum into the narrow court could\r\nbe closed by latticed doors. Similar doors hung also on the wooden\r\njambs of the north and south entrances. With such doors a complete\r\nsafeguarding could not have been contemplated. Tradespeople using the\r\nBasilica must either have removed their wares at the close of business\r\nhours or have made the stalls sufficiently secure for protection. We\r\ncan hardly doubt that ordinarily a night watchman was on duty about\r\nthe building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n_THE TEMPLE OF APOLLO_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some respects the study of the large temple on the west side of the\r\nForum is especially satisfactory. The building had been completely\r\nrestored after the earthquake of 63, and was in good order at the time\r\nof its destruction. Though ancient excavators removed many objects of\r\nvalue, including the statue of the divinity of the temple, much was\r\nleft undisturbed, as the interesting series of statues in the court;\r\nin addition, a number of inscriptions have been recovered. On the\r\nwhole, more complete information is at hand regarding this sanctuary\r\nthan in reference to any other in Pompeii.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 28.--Corner of mosaic floor, cella of the temple\r\n   of Apollo.]\r\n\r\nThe identification of this as the temple of Apollo is certain. The\r\naccompanying illustration shows a corner of the floor laid over the\r\ngreater part of the cella (3 on the plan); the parts along the inner\r\nwalls were of white mosaic. This floor was composed of small,\r\nlozenge-shaped pieces of green and white marble and slate; of the two\r\nnarrow stripes between the lozenge pattern and the bright mosaic fret\r\nalong the border one is of slate, the other of red marble. In the\r\nslate stripe was an inscription. The letters were outlined by means of\r\nsmall holes filled with metal, every seven holes forming a vertical\r\nline, every four a horizontal. The inscription, which was in Oscan,\r\nstated that the quaestor O[ppius] Camp[anius], by order of the council\r\nand with money belonging to Apollo, had caused something to be\r\nmade;[3] what this was cannot be determined, as the important word is\r\nmissing, but apparently it was the floor. In the cella, moreover,\r\nstands a block of tufa, having the shape of half an egg; this is the\r\nOmphalos, the familiar symbol of Apollo. In the court on the first\r\npilaster at the right as you enter a tripod is painted, too large for\r\nmere decoration, and explicable only as a symbol of the god. Lastly,\r\nin the design of the stucco ornamentation with which the entablature\r\nof the peristyle was adorned after the earthquake, the principal\r\nfigures are griffins. The griffin was sacred to Apollo, and though it\r\nwas often used as a purely decorative theme, in this case a reference\r\nto the divinity of the temple is unmistakable (Fig. 31).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 29.--Plan of the temple of Apollo.\r\n\r\n     1. Colonnade.\r\n     2. Podium.\r\n     3. Cella.\r\n     4. Altar.\r\n     5. Sundial.\r\n     6. Sacristan's room.]\r\n\r\nAs previously stated (p. 49), the deviation of the axis of this\r\nbuilding from that of the Forum is undoubtedly due to the fact that it\r\nfollowed the direction of a street which bordered it on the east side\r\nbefore the colonnade of Popidius was built; this is therefore an\r\nevidence of the antiquity of the temple. The style of architecture,\r\nhowever, is in no essential particular different from that of the\r\ncolonnade and of other buildings of the Tufa Period, and gives no\r\nindication of great age. The most probable explanation is that the\r\ntemple was rebuilt in the Tufa Period on the site of an earlier\r\nstructure, the orientation of which was preserved. The difference in\r\ndirection is concealed by the increasing thickness, from south to\r\nnorth, of the pillars between the Forum and the court of the temple.\r\nThe spaces between the pillars were originally left open. Later, at\r\nwhat time it is impossible to determine, they were all walled up\r\nexcept the three opposite the side of the temple; since the temple was\r\nexcavated these also have been closed. In comparison with the\r\nentrances from the Forum, at first ten in number, the one on the\r\nsouth side, opening on the street leading from the Porta Marina, must\r\nhave been considered unimportant. Otherwise pains would have been\r\ntaken to give to the colonnade on that side an even number of columns,\r\nso that the door of the temple should face an intercolumniation; as it\r\nis the number is uneven and the entrance to the court had to be put a\r\nlittle to one side that it might not open upon a column.\r\n\r\nThe court is of oblong shape. The continuous colonnade about the\r\nsides, the peristyle, was originally in two stories. At the rear of\r\nthe peristyle on the north side stood the small colonnade of the Doric\r\norder already mentioned (p. 62); one of the rooms into which in later\r\ntimes this was divided (6) was connected with the court of the temple,\r\nand was probably occupied by the sacristan (_aedituus_).\r\n\r\nThe temple stood upon a high podium, in front of which is a broad\r\nflight of steps. The small cella was evidently intended for but one\r\nstatue. The columns at the sides of the deep portico, which in other\r\nrespects follows the Etruscan plan (p. 63), are continued in a\r\ncolonnade which is carried completely around the cella.\r\n\r\nIn Plate II and Fig. 30 we give a view of the ruins as they are\r\nto-day; in Fig. 32 a view of the temple as it appeared before the\r\nearthquake of 63. The height and diameter of the Corinthian columns\r\nseen in the restoration can be calculated with approximate\r\ncorrectness; of the entablature and parts above nothing has been found\r\nexcept a large waterspout of terra cotta in the form of a lion's head.\r\n\r\nThe colonnade about the court was built of tufa, and coated with white\r\nstucco. It presents an odd mixture of styles, of which other examples\r\nalso are found at Pompeii; a Doric entablature with triglyphs was\r\nplaced upon Ionic columns having the four-sided capital known as Roman\r\nIonic. Here, as in the earlier colonnade about the Forum, the stone\r\nblocks of the entablature were set upon beams; and in the blocks now\r\nin place we may see the sockets made to receive the ends of the joists\r\nof the second story floor. Evidently with the purpose of supporting\r\nthis second story, which was probably of the Corinthian order, the\r\nIonic columns below were made relatively short. No remains of an\r\nupper gallery, however, have been found; and it is quite possible that\r\nwhen the colonnade was restored, after the earthquake, the second\r\nstory was omitted. The upper floor could be reached from the second\r\nstory of the small colonnade north of the court, which was accessible\r\nby means of a stairway leading from the Forum.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 30.--View of the temple of Apollo, looking toward\r\n   Vesuvius. At the left of the steps, the column on which was the\r\n   sundial; in front of the steps, the altar.]\r\n\r\nWhen the restoration of the temple and its colonnade was undertaken,\r\nthe feeling for the pure and simple forms of the Greek architecture\r\nwas no longer present; the prevailing taste demanded gay and fantastic\r\ndesigns, with the use of brilliant colors. The Pompeians improved the\r\nopportunity afforded by the rebuilding to make the temple and its\r\ncolonnade conform to the taste of the times.\r\n\r\nFirst the projecting portions of the Ionic and Corinthian capitals\r\nwere cut off; then shaft and capital alike were covered with a thick\r\nlayer of stucco. New capitals were moulded in the stucco, of a shape\r\nin general resembling the Corinthian, and were painted in red, blue,\r\nand yellow; the lower part of the shaft, unfluted, was also painted\r\nyellow. The entablature, at least in the case of the colonnade, was in\r\nlike manner covered with stucco and ornamented with reliefs in the\r\nsame colors. All this gaudy stucco has now fallen off; and our\r\nillustration (Fig. 31) is taken from Mazois, who made the drawing soon\r\nafter the court was excavated. The later capitals and stucco\r\nornamentation of the temple itself had wholly disappeared before the\r\nexcavations were made.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 31.--Section of the entablature of the temple of\r\n   Apollo, showing the original form and the restoration after the\r\n   earthquake.]\r\n\r\nThe wall decoration of both the temple and the colonnade was\r\noriginally in the first style; a remnant of it may still be seen in\r\nthe cella. After 63 it was modernized. The walls of the temple both\r\nwithin and without were done over in stucco, so as to resemble ashlar\r\nwork of white marble; apparently it was the intention to give the\r\nappearance of real marble. The walls of the colonnade were painted in\r\nthe latest Pompeian style, in bright colors, on a white ground. The\r\ndecorative designs, to judge from the remains and from sketches, were\r\nnot of special interest. There was a series of pictures representing\r\nscenes from the Trojan War,--the quarrel between Achilles and\r\nAgamemnon, the embassy of the Greeks to Achilles, the battle between\r\nAchilles and Hector (the subject of this, however, is doubtful), the\r\ndragging of Hector's body about the walls of Troy, Priam making\r\nentreaty for the body of Hector, and the rape of the Palladium,--but\r\nthey have long since perished and are known only from unsatisfactory\r\ndrawings.\r\n\r\nLong before this modernizing of the temple the west side of the court\r\nhad undergone a complete transformation. The peculiar bend in the\r\nstreet at the northwest corner (shown in Plan II), the diagonal line\r\nwith which the small colonnade north of the court ends, and the\r\nnarrow, quite inaccessible space between the west wall of the court\r\nand the houses lying near it, cannot easily be explained as a part of\r\nan original plan, but must rather be the result of later changes. The\r\nnorth and south street which now ends abruptly at the northwest corner\r\nmust originally have been continued through the west colonnade, the\r\nends of which were left open; this colonnade was then a public\r\nthoroughfare, on which the windows of houses opened, and perhaps also\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\nWe learn from an inscription that about the year 10 B.C. the city\r\npurchased from the residents whose property adjoined the colonnade,\r\nfor the sum of 3000 sesterces (about $155), the right to build a wall\r\nin front of their windows; this explains how the narrow space between\r\nthe wall on the north side of the court and the houses came to be cut\r\noff. The inscription reads: _M. Holconius Rufus d[uum] v[ir] i[uri]\r\nd[icundo] tert[ium], C. Egnatius Postumus d. v. i. d. iter[um] ex\r\nd[ecurionum] d[ecreto] ius luminum opstruendorum [=HS] [M] [M] [M]\r\nredemerunt, parietemque privatum Col[oniae] Ven[eriae] Cor[neliae]\r\nusque ad tegulas faciundum coerarunt_,--'Marcus Holconius Rufus,\r\nduumvir with judiciary authority for the third time, and Gaius\r\nEgnatius Postumus, duumvir with judiciary authority for the second\r\ntime, in accordance with a decree of the city council purchased for\r\n3000 sesterces the right to shut off light (from adjoining buildings)\r\nand caused to be constructed a wall belonging to the colony of Pompeii\r\nto the height of the tiles,' that is, as high as the roofs of the\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nThe wall referred to was no doubt that on the west side of the court\r\nof the temple; when it was built the ends of the colonnade on that\r\nside must have been closed, so that this ceased to be a thoroughfare.\r\nMarcus Holconius was duumvir for the fourth time in the year 3-2\r\nB.C.; as an interval of at least five years must intervene between two\r\nduumvirates, his third duumvirate must have been not far from 10 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe pedestal in the cella, on which the statue of Apollo stood, still\r\nremains, but no trace of the statue itself has been found.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 32.--Temple of Apollo, restored.]\r\n\r\nNear the foot of the steps in front is a large altar of travertine,\r\nhaving the same inscription on both sides: _M. Porcius M. f., L.\r\nSextilius L. f., Cn. Cornelius Cn. f., A. Cornelius A. f. IIII vir[i]\r\nd[e] d[ecurionum] s[ententia] f[aciundum] locar[unt]_,--'Marcus\r\nPorcius the son of Marcus, Lucius Sextilius the son of Lucius, Gnaeus\r\nCornelius the son of Gnaeus, and Aulus Cornelius the son of Aulus, the\r\nBoard of Four, in accordance with the vote of the city council let the\r\ncontract (for building this altar).' The names of the four officials\r\nwho erected the altar, the two duumvirs and two aediles (for the title\r\nsee p. 12), appear without surnames; this points to a relatively early\r\ntime, at the latest the age of Augustus.\r\n\r\nAt the left of the steps is an Ionic column with the inscription: _L.\r\nSepunius L. f. Sandilianus, M. Herennius A. f. Epidianus duovir[i]\r\ni[uri] d[icundo] d[e] s[ua] p[ecunia] f[aciundum] c[urarunt]_,--'Lucius\r\nSepunius Sandilianus the son of Lucius, and Marcus Herennius Epidianus\r\nthe son of Aulus, duumvirs with judiciary authority, caused (this) to\r\nbe erected at their own expense.' Old sketches, made soon after the\r\ncourt was excavated, represent the column with a sundial on the top.\r\nThe probability that a sundial belonging to the column was actually\r\nfound is increased by the fact that these same men placed one on the\r\ncircular bench in the Forum Triangulare. Here, in front of the temple\r\nof the Sun-god, such a dial would certainly have been in place. At the\r\nright of the steps are some blocks of lava containing holes, in which,\r\nundoubtedly, the supports of a votive offering were once set, but the\r\nholes give no clew to the size or character of the offering.\r\n\r\nOther divinities besides Apollo were honored in this sanctuary, which\r\nin the earlier time was evidently the most important in the city;\r\nstatues and altars for their worship were placed in the court. The\r\npedestals of the statues still remain where they were originally\r\nplaced, on the step in front of the stylobate of the colonnade; the\r\nstatues themselves, with one exception, have been taken to Naples.\r\nThere were in all six of them, grouped in three related pairs. In\r\nfront of the third column at the left of the entrance, stood Venus, at\r\nthe right was a hermaphrodite--both marble figures of about one half\r\nlife size. They belong to the pre-Roman period and were originally of\r\ngood workmanship, but even in antiquity they had been repeatedly\r\nrestored and worked over. As a work of art, the hermaphrodite is the\r\nmore important.\r\n\r\nAn altar stands before the statue of Venus. In pre-Roman times this\r\nmay have been the only shrine in the city at which worship was offered\r\nto Herentas; for by that name the goddess of love was known in the\r\nnative speech. Venus as goddess of the Roman colony (Fig. 4), was\r\nrepresented in an altogether different guise, and had a special place\r\nof worship elsewhere (see pp. 124-129).\r\n\r\nThough the statues of Venus and of the hermaphrodite here form a pair,\r\nboth artistically and in respect to arrangement, the latter belongs\r\nnot to the cycle of Venus but to that of Bacchus; and in order to make\r\nthis the more evident, the ears of a satyr were given to the figure.\r\nWe may, perhaps, infer that the god of wine also was worshipped in\r\nthis sanctuary. In the sacristan's room (6 on the plan) we find a\r\npainting in which Bacchus is represented as leaning upon Silenus who\r\nis playing the lyre, meanwhile allowing the panther to drink out of\r\nhis cup. This seems strange enough in a temple of Apollo; still it\r\ncannot be considered conclusive evidence that Bacchus actually\r\nreceived worship here. Without doubt the Wine-god was honored in\r\nPompeii, the region about which was rich in vines. He appears\r\ncountless times in wall paintings, but no shrine dedicated to him has\r\nyet been found.\r\n\r\nOn the right side of the court, in front of the third column, was a\r\nstatue of Apollo; on the left directly opposite stood Artemis, both\r\nlife size figures in bronze. An altar stood before the statue of\r\nArtemis; the altar of Apollo was before the temple. Both statues were\r\narmed with the bow, and it is evident that they were not designed to\r\nstand facing each other, but side by side, or one behind the other;\r\nboth may originally have belonged to a Niobe group. As works of art,\r\nthey are not of high merit. We recognize a certain elegance and nicety\r\nof finish, but these qualities cannot compensate for superficiality in\r\nthe treatment of the figure, want of expression in the faces, and lack\r\nof energy in the movement. We have no other evidence of the worship of\r\nArtemis in Pompeii.\r\n\r\nFurther on, in front of the fifth column on either side, was a marble\r\nherm. That on the right is still in place and is seen in Plate II. It\r\nis of fine workmanship, and clearly belongs to the pre-Roman period;\r\nit represents Hermes, or Mercury. The god appears as a youth standing\r\nwith his mantle drawn over the back of his head; the face, with a\r\nplacid, serious, mild expression, is inclined a little forward. In\r\nthis form Mercury was honored as the presiding divinity of the\r\npalaestra, the god of gymnastic exercises; we shall find him in the\r\nsame guise later in the court of the Stabian Baths (p. 200). How this\r\ntype of Hermes came to be chosen for the place of honor in athletic\r\ncourts is by no means clear; it was certainly designed originally to\r\nrepresent him as a god of death, the Psychopompus, conductor of souls\r\nto the Underworld. The worship of Mercury here as a god of gymnastic\r\nexercises would not be in harmony with the surroundings; we should\r\nrather believe that the Pompeians, having placed him in such close\r\nrelation with Apollo, god of the death-dealing shaft, and the earth\r\ngoddess, Maia, associated more serious ideas with his image.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE II.--COURT OF THE TEMPLE OF APOLLO]\r\n\r\nThe herm on the opposite side of the court probably represented Maia.\r\nNo trace of it has been found; the female herm in the Naples Museum\r\nformerly assigned to this place is now known to have been brought from\r\nRome. In Greek mythology, the mother of Hermes was Maia, the daughter\r\nof Atlas; and this relationship, by a common confusion, was\r\ntransferred to the Italian Maia, who was originally goddess of the\r\nspring, and gave her name to the month of May. The assignment of the\r\nherm opposite Mercury to Maia is based upon a number of inscriptions\r\nwhich establish the existence of a cult of Mercury and Maia in\r\nPompeii. From the same source we learn that with the worship of these\r\ntwo that of Augustus was intimately associated; there are few better\r\nillustrations of the development of emperor worship in the Early\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nThese inscriptions were found in different places, none of them in\r\ntheir original location. They are dedications once attached to votive\r\nofferings, of which one was set up each year by a college of priests,\r\nconsisting of slaves and freedmen, under the general direction of the\r\ncity authorities. The official title of this college at first,\r\ncertainly to 14 B.C., was _Ministri Mercurii Maiae_, 'Servants of\r\nMercury and Maia'; the word _minister_ indicates a low order of\r\npriesthood. The worship of the emperor was then added, and the priests\r\nwere called 'Servants of Augustus, Mercury, and Maia.' Still later, at\r\nleast as early as 2 B.C., the names of the two divinities were\r\ndropped, and the priests were designated simply as 'Servants of\r\nAugustus.'\r\n\r\nThe extant inscriptions of this series come down to the year 40 A.D.\r\nAs an example, we give that of 2 B.C., in which the _ministri Augusti_\r\nfirst appear: _N. Veius Phylax, N. Popidius Moschus, T. Mescinius\r\nAmphio, Primus Arrunti M. s., min. Aug., ex d. d. iussu M. Holconii\r\nRufi IV, A. Clodi Flacci III d. v. i. d., P. Caeseti Postumi, N.\r\nTintiri Rufi d. v. v. a. s. p. p. Imp. Caesare XIII, M. Plautio\r\nSilvano cos_,--'Numerius Veius Phylax, Numerius Popidius Moschus,\r\nTitus Mescinius Amphio and Primus the slave of Marcus Arruntius,\r\nServants of Augustus (set this up), in accordance with a decree of the\r\ncity council, on the order of Marcus Holconius Rufus, duumvir with\r\njudiciary authority for the fourth time, Aulus Clodius Flaccus,\r\nduumvir for the third time, and of Publius Caesetius Postumus and\r\nNumerius Tintirius Rufus, duumvirs in charge of the streets,\r\nbuildings, and public religious festivals (the official title of the\r\naediles, p. 13) in the thirteenth consulship of the Emperor Caesar\r\n(Augustus), the other consul being Marcus Plautius Silvanus.'\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to understand how the worship of Augustus came to\r\nhave a place in this sanctuary. The divinities here honored stood in\r\nclose relation to him. Apollo was his tutelary divinity, to whom he\r\nthought that he owed the victory at Actium, and in whose honor he\r\nbuilt the magnificent temple on the Palatine. Venus, moreover, was\r\nrevered as the ancestress of the Julian family; and finally Mercury\r\nwas said to be incarnate in Augustus himself.\r\n\r\nThis last conception found expression in one of the finest of the odes\r\nof Horace, written in 28 B.C. Fearful portents, the poet says, are\r\nthreatening Rome; Jupiter with flaming right hand has even struck his\r\nown temple on the Capitoline. To what god shall we turn for help--to\r\nApollo, to Venus, or to Mars? or rather to thee, winged god, Maia's\r\nson, that even now doest walk the earth in the form of a youth, the\r\navenger of Caesar:--\r\n\r\n     Sive mutata iuvenem figura\r\n     Ales in terris imitaris almae\r\n     Filius Maiae, patiens vocari\r\n             Caesaris ultor.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that evidence of the worship of Augustus as\r\nMercury has come to light also in Egypt. In an inscription from\r\nDenderah we find _Helmis Kaisar_, 'beloved of Ptah and of Isis';\r\nHelmis Kaisar is apparently 'Hermes Caesar,' and in Egyptian\r\ninscriptions Augustus is elsewhere referred to as 'the beloved of Ptah\r\nand of Isis.'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[3] O .

We do not know\r\nwhether at the time of the eruption it had yet been roofed; the inside\r\nat least was in an unfinished state.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 33.--Plan of the buildings at the northwest corner\r\n   of the Forum.\r\n\r\n     1. City treasury.\r\n     2. Latrina.\r\n     3, 4. Market buildings.]\r\n\r\nThis building is divided into three parts, one of which, that furthest\r\nnorth, at the corner, contains both lower and upper rooms. Below, at\r\nthe level of the Forum, are two dark vaulted chambers, one at the rear\r\nof the other. The front chamber is dimly lighted by a slit in the\r\nceiling and was entered from the Forum by a narrow door; there are\r\ntraces of a strong iron grating in the doorway. It has been supposed,\r\nnot without probability, that these were the vaults of the city\r\ntreasury, the aerarium; if they had been built for prison cells, they\r\nwould naturally have had separate entrances.\r\n\r\nAbove these chambers are two rooms which open not on the Forum, but on\r\nthe street that runs past them on the north (1, 1). They resemble\r\nshops and would be classed as such without further question but for\r\nthe fact that the level of the floor is nearly five feet above the\r\nsidewalk, so that they could have been reached only by means of steps.\r\nIf the identification of the chambers below as the vaults of the city\r\ntreasury is correct, these rooms must have been occupied by the\r\ntreasury officials, who could here transact business with the public\r\nwithout admitting the latter to their offices.\r\n\r\nThe middle room (2) was a public closet, with a small anteroom. As the\r\ndoors to and from the anteroom were not placed opposite each other,\r\nthe interior was not visible from the street. The room was not\r\nentirely finished; nevertheless, we can see the water channel running\r\nalong three sides, and above it the stones on which the woodwork was\r\nto be placed; the inlet pipe was in position, as well as the outlet\r\nfor carrying the water off into a sewer at the rear.\r\n\r\nThe last of the three parts of the building (3) is by far the largest.\r\nIt was a high and spacious hall, with numerous entrances from the\r\nForum. It was divided into two rooms by two short sections of wall\r\nprojecting from the sides, and was evidently a market house, perhaps\r\nfor vegetables and farm products.\r\n\r\nThe rooms formed by enclosing the small colonnade at the rear of the\r\ncourt of Apollo have already been mentioned (p. 62). At the left of\r\nthe stairway leading to the second story (shown in Plan II) is a small\r\nroom which opens in its entire breadth upon the Forum (11). Close by\r\nis a recess (10), also open toward the Forum, in the side of the first\r\nof the thick pillars which separate the Forum from the court of the\r\ntemple.\r\n\r\nIn this recess stood the table of standard measures, _mensa\r\nponderaria_ (Fig. 34), which is now in the Naples Museum,\r\nunfortunately not entire; a part of it has disappeared. The part\r\nremaining consists of a large slab of limestone (a little over 8 feet\r\nlong and 1.8, or 2 Oscan feet, wide), in which are nine bowl-shaped\r\ncavities with holes at the bottom through which the contents could be\r\ndrawn off; this slab rested on two stone supports, and similar\r\nsupports above it carried another slab, which is now lost, with three\r\ncavities. The table thus contained twelve standards of capacity for\r\nliquid and dry measure, but only ten are shown in the illustration, as\r\ntwo are too far back.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the table has come down from the pre-Roman period.\r\nThe names of the measures were originally written in Oscan, beside the\r\nfive largest cavities, and though the letters were later erased, they\r\nare still in part legible. Only one word, however, can be made out\r\nwith certainty, beside the next to the smallest cavity; that is\r\n_Kuiniks_, plainly the same as the Greek _Choinix_. We naturally infer\r\nthat in the pre-Roman time the Pompeians used Greek measures.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 34.--Table of standard measures, _mensa\r\n   ponderaria_.]\r\n\r\nIn the time of Augustus, about 20 B.C., the cavities were enlarged and\r\nmade to conform to the Roman standard, but the new names were not put\r\nbeside them. The inscription on the front of the larger slab has\r\nreference to these changes: 'Aulus Clodius Flaccus, the son of Aulus,\r\nand Numerius Arcaeus Arellianus Caledus, the son of Numerius, duumvirs\r\nwith judiciary authority, in accordance with a decree of the city\r\ncouncil, caused the measures to be made equal' to the Roman measures.\r\n\r\nA similar adjustment of measures to the Roman standard is indicated by\r\nthe use of the phrase _metra exaequare_ on a table found at Minturnae.\r\nThe adoption of a uniform standard was made a subject of imperial\r\nregulation by Augustus, who, by this means, sought to promote the\r\nunification of the Empire. Similar tables of measures have been found\r\nin various parts of the Roman world, as at Selinunto in Sicily, in the\r\nGreek islands, and at Bregenz on the Lake of Constance.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that an official charged with the oversight of the\r\nmeasures had his office in the small room next to the stairway (11).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n_THE MACELLUM_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe large building at the northeast corner of the Forum was a\r\nprovision market, of the sort called _Macellum_. The name Pantheon,\r\nonce applied to it, is now abandoned, and there is no longer the\r\nslightest doubt regarding its purpose, which is indicated by its\r\ngeneral plan, the remains found in the course of the excavations, and\r\nthe paintings upon the walls.\r\n\r\nSuch markets, where provisions, especially of the finer and more\r\nexpensive kinds, were sold and in which a cook also might be secured,\r\nwithout doubt existed in the Greek cities after the time of Alexander;\r\nfrom the Greeks, as in the case of the basilica, the Romans took both\r\nthe name and the architectural type.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 35.--Plan of the Macellum.\r\n\r\n     1. Portico.\r\n     2. Colonnade.\r\n     3, 3, 3. Rows of market stalls.\r\n     4. Market room for meat and fish.\r\n     5. Chapel.\r\n     6. Banquet room.\r\n     7. Tholus.\r\n     8. Pen.]\r\n\r\nThe first macellum in Rome was built in 179 B.C. in connection with\r\nthe enlargement of a fish market. In later times, as we learn from\r\ninscriptions, others were constructed in Rome and in various cities of\r\nItaly and the provinces.\r\n\r\nA macellum built by Nero is shown on one of the coins of this emperor.\r\nIt agrees in essential points with our building, having stalls or\r\nshops of more than one story in height, and at the middle of the court\r\na structure with a dome-like roof. The central structure, the\r\n_tholus_, is mentioned by Varro as an essential part of a macellum,\r\nbut its use is known to us only from the remains found at Pompeii.\r\n\r\nThe plan of our building is simple. A court in the shape of a\r\nrectangle, slightly longer than it is broad, is surrounded by a deep\r\ncolonnade on the four sides. In the middle twelve bases, arranged so\r\nas to form a dodecagon, supported an equal number of columns on which\r\na roof rested; underneath was a rectangular basin in the pavement,\r\nfrom which a covered drain led toward the southeast corner. Under this\r\nroof the fish that had been sold were scaled, the scales being thrown\r\ninto the basin, where they were found in great quantity. Behind the\r\ncolonnade on the south side, and opening into it, was a row of market\r\nstalls or small shops (3 on the plan). Above these were upper rooms,\r\nin front of which was a wooden gallery, but there was no stairway, and\r\napparently the shopkeeper who wished to use his second story had to\r\nprovide himself with a ladder.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 36.--View of the Macellum.\r\n\r\n   In the foreground, part of the stylobate. In the middle ground,\r\n   remains of the tholus. In the background, at the middle, walls and\r\n   pedestal of the imperial chapel; at the right, market room; at the\r\n   left, banquet room.]\r\n\r\nThere were shops also on the north side, but they opened upon the\r\nstreet bounding the Macellum on the north; a southern exposure for\r\nthe shop fronts seems to have been avoided on account of the damage\r\nthat the heat in summer might cause to the stock. In the shops on this\r\nstreet--whether in those belonging to the building or those on the\r\nopposite side is not stated--the excavators found charred figs,\r\nchestnuts, plums, grapes, fruit in glass vessels, lentils, grain,\r\nloaves of bread, and cakes. A few shops behind the portico in front\r\nfaced toward the Forum.\r\n\r\nA large market room (4) opened on the colonnade at the southeast\r\ncorner, the entrance being divided by two columns. Along three sides\r\nruns a counter for meat and fish, the surface of which slopes toward\r\nthe middle of the room. That fish were sold on the left side is plain\r\nfrom the special arrangement made to carry off the water; the floor\r\nbehind the counter here was raised and sloped toward the rear, where a\r\ngutter connecting with it, and passing across the room, led under the\r\ncounter on the south side into the street.\r\n\r\nIn the little room or pen at the northeast corner of the colonnade (8)\r\nremains of skeletons of sheep were found. Such animals, then, were\r\nsold here alive; instead of buying the flesh of slaughtered animals,\r\nmany purchasers no doubt preferred to obtain a victim which could be\r\nsacrificed as an offering to the household gods before it was used for\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThe paintings on the walls of the colonnade are among the best\r\nexamples of the latest Pompeian style. Above the base are large black\r\npanels with a broad red border; between them, in the vertical spaces\r\nseparating the border of one panel from that of the next, are light\r\nand fantastic architectural designs in yellow on a white ground, the\r\nparts designed to appear furthest from the eye being in green and red.\r\nIn this way a rich development of architectural forms is united, in a\r\nconsistent and effective decorative scheme, with large panels suitable\r\nfor paintings.\r\n\r\nAlong the edges of the black panels run conventional plant designs; in\r\nthe middle are paintings symmetrically arranged in a series in which a\r\npair of floating figures alternates with a mythological scene enclosed\r\nin a painted frame. Among the mythological pictures are Ulysses before\r\nPenelope, who does not recognize him, Io guarded by Argus, and Medea\r\nplotting the murder of her children. The whole arrangement is in\r\nexcellent taste, while the execution is careful and delicate.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the upper part of the wall is especially worthy of\r\nnote. Generally in walls of the fourth style the portion above the\r\nlarge panels is filled with airy architectural designs upon a white or\r\nat least a bright ground. In this instance the fantastic architectural\r\nforms in the spaces between the black panels are continued upwards to\r\nthe ceiling, and in the midst of each group a standing figure is\r\npainted on a blue ground--a girl with utensils for sacrifice, a satyr\r\nplaying the flute; but the spaces above the panels are completely\r\nfilled with representations of the things exposed for sale.\r\nUnfortunately only a few of these pictures remain. One contains birds,\r\nsome alive, some killed and dressed; in another, different kinds of\r\nfish are seen; and a third presents a variety of vessels in which wine\r\nand other liquids could be kept. This departure from the usual style\r\nof decoration, strikingly suggestive, can be explained only as having\r\na direct reference to the purpose of the building.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 37.--The Macellum, restored.]\r\n\r\nIn two small pictures in the black panels of the north entrance Cupids\r\ntook the place of men. The Pompeians were very fond of the\r\nrepresentation of Cupids as engaged in human occupations; it gave\r\nopportunity for the poetic treatment of everyday life, which was thus\r\ncarried over into fairyland. So in one picture sprightly, winged\r\nlittle figures are celebrating the festival of Vesta, the tutelary\r\ndivinity of millers and bakers, who on this day, just as appears in\r\nthe painting, wreathed with garlands their mills and much belabored\r\nasses that once a year were thus admitted to a share in the festal\r\ncelebrations of their masters; the reference to trade in bread and\r\nflour is obvious.\r\n\r\nIn the other picture the Cupids are plaiting and selling wreaths; in\r\nview of the extensive use of garlands at banquets and on gala days the\r\ninference is warranted that they, too, were sold in this market. In\r\nthe market room for meat and fish there is another interesting picture\r\nrepresenting the local divinities of Pompeii--personifications of the\r\nSarno, of the coast, and of the country round about, suggesting that\r\nhere the products of the sea, the river, and the land might be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 38.--Statue of Octavia, sister of Augustus, found\r\n   in the chapel of the Macellum. She is represented in an attitude of\r\n   worship, with a libation saucer in her right hand, and a box of\r\n   incense in her left.]\r\n\r\nBesides the rooms thus far considered, which served a practical end,\r\nwe find in the Macellum two other rooms which gave to the building a\r\nreligious character and placed it under the special protection of the\r\nimperial house. One, at the middle of the east end (5), is a chapel\r\nconsecrated to the worship of the emperors. The floor is raised above\r\nthat of the rest of the building, and the entrance is reached by five\r\nsteps leading up from the rear of the colonnade. On a pedestal against\r\nthe rear wall, and in four niches at the sides, were statues, of which\r\nonly the two in the niches at the right have been found; these\r\nrepresent Octavia, the sister of Augustus (Fig. 38), and Marcellus\r\n(Fig. 39), the hope of Augustus and of Rome, whose untimely death was\r\nlamented by Virgil in those touching verses in the sixth book of the\r\nAeneid. An arm with a globe was also found, doubtless belonging to the\r\nstatue of an emperor that stood on the pedestal at the rear. The\r\nchapel contains no altar; sacrifice was probably offered on a portable\r\nbronze coal pan in the form of a tripod. Several beautiful examples of\r\nthese movable altars have been found, and there are numerous\r\nrepresentations of them in reliefs and in wall paintings.\r\n\r\nThe Macellum in its present form was at the time of the eruption by no\r\nmeans an ancient building. While finished and no doubt in use at the\r\ntime of the earthquake of 63, it had been built not many years before,\r\nin the reign of Claudius or of Nero, in the place of an older\r\nstructure which dated from the pre-Roman period. The earlier Macellum,\r\nof which scanty but indubitable traces remain, could not have\r\ncontained a chapel for the worship of the emperors; this was probably\r\nintroduced into the plan of the structure at the time of the\r\nrebuilding. The most reasonable supposition is that the chapel was\r\nbuilt in honor of Claudius, and that his statue with the globe as a\r\nsymbol of world sovereignty stood on the pedestal at the rear, while\r\nin the niches at the left were his wife Agrippina and adopted son\r\nNero.\r\n\r\nWe can hardly doubt that Claudius was worshipped in Pompeii during his\r\nlifetime; it is known from inscriptions that even before the death of\r\nClaudius Nero was honored with the services of a special priest. That\r\nOctavia and Marcellus, another mother with a son who was heir to the\r\nthrone, should be placed opposite Agrippina and Nero, was quite\r\nnatural. Claudius, who through his mother Antonia was the grandson of\r\nOctavia, had great pride in this relationship, through which alone he\r\nwas connected with the family of Augustus; and from Octavia, Agrippina\r\nand Nero also were descended, the former as a daughter of Germanicus,\r\nClaudius's brother, and the latter through his father Gnaeus Domitius,\r\nwho was a son of the older daughter of Octavia, also called Antonia.\r\nThis thought was suggested by the grouping of Octavia and Marcellus\r\nwith Agrippina and Nero: Octavia's descendants are now on the throne,\r\nas Augustus intended that they should be; and Nero is the pride and\r\nhope of the emperor and the Roman people, as once Marcellus was.\r\n\r\nThe room at the left of the imperial chapel, with a wide entrance\r\ndivided by two columns (6), was also consecrated to the worship of the\r\nemperors. It contains a low altar (shown on the plan) of peculiar\r\nshape. A slab of black stone rests on two marble steps; it has a\r\nraised rim about the edge with a hole in one corner. Evidently this is\r\nan altar for drink offerings; in this room sacrificial meals were\r\npartaken of, at which the long estrade at the right, like a counter,\r\nnearly three feet high, was perhaps used as a serving table. Such\r\nmeals had an important place among the functions of the Roman colleges\r\nof priests, and some priesthood connected with the worship of the\r\nemperors apparently had its place of meeting here; but whether this\r\nwas the college of the Seviri Augustales, composed of freedmen, or a\r\nmore aristocratic priesthood modelled after the Sodales Augustales at\r\nRome, cannot be determined. The purpose of the niche in the corner,\r\nwith the platform in front of it approached by steps, is unknown.\r\n\r\nIn this room, also, there were two pictures containing Cupids. In one\r\nthey were represented as drinking wine and playing the lyre; in the\r\nother, as engaged in acts of worship--both appropriate decorative\r\nsubjects for a room intended for sacrificial banquets.\r\n\r\nThe Macellum was entered from three sides. At the front, facing the\r\nForum, was a portico consisting of two orders of white marble columns,\r\none above the other, supporting a roof. Fragments of the Ionic or\r\nCorinthian columns belonging to the lower order, and of the well\r\nproportioned intermediate entablature, have been preserved. Statues\r\nstood at the foot of the columns, as also at the ends of the party\r\nwalls between the shops at the rear of the portico, and beside the two\r\ncolumns of the little vestibule at the entrance; between the two doors\r\nwas a small shrine, and here, too, was a statue.\r\n\r\nThe difference in direction between the front of the Macellum and the\r\nside of the Forum is concealed by increasing the depth of the shops\r\nfrom south to north, so that the depth of the portico remained the\r\nsame. The room at the extreme right, being so shallow that it could\r\nnot be used as a shop, was made into a shrine; the image or images set\r\nup in it must have been very small. What divinities were worshipped\r\nhere, unless the Street Lares, cannot be conjectured.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 39.--Statue of Marcellus, son of Octavia, found in\r\n   the chapel of the Macellum.]\r\n\r\nThere is another entrance on the north side, and a third near the\r\nsoutheast corner. In the latter are steps, and at the left as you come\r\nin is a small niche under which two serpents were painted. This humble\r\nshrine was probably dedicated to the presiding divinity of the\r\nbuilding, the Genius Macelli.\r\n\r\nThe colonnade of the Macellum was thrown down by the earthquake of 63.\r\nAt the time of the eruption the stylobate on which the columns rested,\r\nand the gutter in front of it, had been renewed; but only the columns\r\non the north side and a part of those on the west side had been set up\r\nagain. Both the columns and the entablature have entirely disappeared,\r\nin consequence of excavations made in ancient times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n_THE SANCTUARY OF THE CITY LARES_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn earlier times a street opened into the Forum south of the Macellum.\r\nLater, apparently in the time of Augustus, it was closed, and the end,\r\ntogether with adjoining space at the south, was occupied by a building\r\nwhich measures approximately sixty by seventy Roman feet.\r\n\r\nIn richness of material and architectural detail this was among the\r\nfinest edifices at Pompeii. Its walls and floors were completely\r\ncovered with marble. Now we see only rough masonry, stripped of its\r\nveneering, but enough vestiges remain to enable us to reconstruct the\r\nwhole; in Figs. 41 and 42 both rear and side views of the interior are\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 40.--Plan of the sanctuary of the City Lares.\r\n\r\n     1. Main room, unroofed, with an altar in the centre.\r\n     2. Apse, with shrine.\r\n     3. Recesses--alae.\r\n     4. Niche facing the Forum.]\r\n\r\nOpening into the main room at the rear is a large apse (Fig. 40, 2),\r\nwhich gives to the building a peculiar character. In the inner part of\r\nthe apse is a broad foundation about six feet high, on which stood a\r\nshrine (_aedicula_), containing a pedestal for three statues of not\r\nmore than life size; the foundation projects in front of the pedestal,\r\nforming a table for offerings. A base of the same height as the\r\nfoundation of the shrine runs along the walls of the apse; it\r\nsupported two columns and two attached half-columns on the right, and\r\nthe same number on the left.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the main room is a recess, _ala_, containing a\r\npedestal for a statue of more than life size. The two entrances were\r\nflanked by pilasters nearly two Roman feet square, while each entrance\r\nwas divided into three parts by two columns. There were three niches\r\nabout six feet above the floor in each of the side walls of the main\r\nroom, and two more at the rear; all were originally flanked by small\r\npilasters which rested on a projecting base. The remains of an altar\r\nmay still be seen in the middle of the room.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 41.--Sanctuary of the City Lares, looking toward\r\n   the rear, restored.]\r\n\r\nThe height of both side and rear walls can be approximately computed\r\nfrom the existing remains, the basis of computation for the side walls\r\nbeing the thickness of the pilasters at the entrance. The rear part of\r\nthe building was certainly not less than 45 feet high, exclusive of\r\nthe gable, while the sides could not have been more than 30 or at most\r\n35. This difference in height, taken with other indications, obliges\r\nus to conclude that the central room was treated as a paved court open\r\nto the sky; only the apse and the wings were roofed.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that we have here a place of worship, yet not, properly\r\nspeaking, a temple. The shrine in the apse, with its broad pedestal\r\nfor several relatively small images, presents a striking analogy to\r\nthe shrines of the Lares found in so many private houses. Cities, as\r\nwell as households, had their guardian spirits. The worship of these\r\ntutelary divinities was reorganized by Augustus, who ordered that,\r\njust as the Genius of the master of the house was worshipped at the\r\nfamily shrine, so his Genius should receive honor together with the\r\nLares of the different cities; thus in each city the emperor was to be\r\nlooked upon as a father, the head of the common household. As the\r\nhouse had its shrine for the Lares, so also had the city; that in Rome\r\nwas near the spot on which the arch of Titus was afterwards erected.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 42.--North side of the sanctuary of the City\r\n   Lares, restored.]\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly we should recognize in this edifice the sanctuary of the\r\nLares of the city, _Lararium publicum_. On the pedestal of the shrine\r\nin the apse the Genius of Augustus probably stood, represented by a\r\nstatue of the emperor himself, with his toga drawn over the back of\r\nhis head, offering a libation; on his right and on his left were the\r\ntwo Lares, like those represented in paintings (p. 271) and in the\r\nlittle bronze images so often found in house shrines.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Lares the members of a family honored other\r\ngods, Penates, to whose special protection the head of the household\r\nhad committed himself and his interests. As we shall see later, in\r\nhouse shrines diminutive bronze figures representing Hercules,\r\nMercury, Fortuna, and other divinities are often found together with\r\nthose of the Lares. It is quite possible that other gods were likewise\r\nassociated with the Lares of the city; and perhaps here in the two\r\nchapels at the sides of the main room images of Ceres and of Bacchus\r\nwere placed. Regarding the statues that stood in the eight niches it\r\nis better to refrain from conjecture. On the outside of the building,\r\nunder the portico of the Macellum, was a small platform (4), the\r\nraised floor of which was reached by steps.\r\n\r\nAt the edge of the Forum in front of the building are eight square\r\nblocks of basalt, which still have traces of the iron clamps by which\r\nmarble veneering was fastened on. These supported the columns of a\r\nportico which was joined with the porticos of the Macellum and the\r\ntemple of Vespasian and took the place of the Forum colonnade. As the\r\nmain room of the building was open to the sky, the portico also must\r\nhave been without a roof; there is no trace of any support for the\r\nends of the rafters at the rear. The columns in front, probably of two\r\norders one above the other, were merely for ornament. Possibly awnings\r\nwere at times stretched over the area of the portico as a protection\r\nagainst sun and rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n_THE TEMPLE OF VESPASIAN_\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth of the sanctuary of the City Lares is another religious edifice\r\nof an entirely different character. Passing from the Forum across the\r\nopen space once occupied by the portico--of which no remains have been\r\nfound--we enter a wide doorway and find ourselves in a four-sided\r\ncourt somewhat irregular in shape (Fig. 43). The front part is\r\noccupied by a colonnade (1).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 43.--Plan of the temple of Vespasian.\r\n\r\n     1. Colonnade.\r\n     2. Altar.\r\n     3. Temple.\r\n     4. Portico, forming part of the colonnade of the Forum.]\r\n\r\nAt the rear a small temple (3) stands upon a high podium which\r\nprojects in front of the cella and reached by two flights of steps.\r\nThe pedestal for the image of the divinity is built against the rear\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the court is an altar faced with marble and adorned\r\non all four sides with reliefs of moderately good workmanship. The\r\nsacrificial scene shown in the accompanying illustration (Fig. 44) is\r\non the front side, facing the entrance to the court. A priest with a\r\ntoga drawn over his head in the manner prescribed for those offering\r\nsacrifice, pours a libation from a shallow bowl, _patera_, upon an\r\naltar having the form of a tripod. With him at the left are two\r\nlictors with their bundles of rods, a fluteplayer, two boys,\r\n_camilli_, carrying the utensils for the sacrifice, and an attendant;\r\nat the right a bull intended for sacrifice is being brought to the\r\naltar by the slayer, _victimarius_, and an assistant. In the\r\nbackground is a tetrastyle temple, doubtless the temple before us; the\r\nscene represents the dedicatory exercises. The middle intercolumniation\r\nof the portico, as indicated by the relief and shown in the plan, is\r\nwider than the other two.\r\n\r\nOn the sides of the altar some of the utensils and ceremonial objects\r\nused in sacrificing are represented: at the left the napkin\r\n(_mantele_), the augural staff (_lituus_), and the box in which the\r\nincense was kept (_acerra_); at the right the libation bowl\r\n(_patera_), a ladle (_simpulum_), and a pitcher.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 44.--Front of the altar in the court of the temple\r\n   of Vespasian.]\r\n\r\nThe reliefs on the back of the altar, which consist simply of a wreath\r\nof oak leaves with a conventional laurel on either side, are of\r\nspecial significance and give a clew to the purpose of the edifice. On\r\nthe thirteenth of January, 27 B.C., the Senate voted that a civic\r\ncrown--that is, one made of oak leaves, of the kind awarded to a\r\nsoldier who had saved the life of a Roman citizen--should be placed\r\nabove the door of the house in which Augustus lived, and that the\r\ndoorposts should be wreathed with laurel. From that time the civic\r\ncrown and the laurel were recognized as attributes denoting imperial\r\nrank. This temple, therefore, was built in honor of an emperor. From\r\nthe inscriptions of the Arval Brethren, we learn that in the case of a\r\nliving emperor a bull was the suitable victim, but that an ox was\r\nsacrificed to an emperor who had been deified after death. As the\r\nvictim on our altar is a bull, the temple must have been dedicated to\r\nan emperor during his lifetime. With these facts in mind it will not\r\nbe difficult to ascertain to whose worship the building was\r\nconsecrated.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 45.--View of the temple of Vespasian.]\r\n\r\nThe coins of Augustus have both the civic crown and the laurel, but\r\nthose of his immediate successors have only the former. In the year 74\r\nthe laurel again appears with the crown on the coins of Vespasian and\r\nTitus, and we may suppose that the distinction formerly conferred on\r\nAugustus was about this time revived in honor of Vespasian. It was\r\nindeed quite natural that men should think of Vespasian and Augustus\r\ntogether. Both restored peace and order after disastrous civil wars;\r\nboth adopted severe repressive measures against luxury and immorality,\r\nand both adorned Rome with great public buildings. The temple of\r\nJupiter on the Capitoline, which Augustus had repaired and made more\r\nmagnificent, Vespasian rebuilt from the foundation after it was burned\r\nin 69.\r\n\r\nThe Senate, which had suffered so seriously at the hands of Nero, had\r\nreason to be deeply grateful to Vespasian, who treated it with marked\r\nrespect, in this also following the example of Augustus. If the annals\r\nof the reigns of the Flavian emperors were not so meagre, we should\r\nvery likely find a decree of the Senate honoring Vespasian with the\r\ncivic crown and the laurel. Such a decree might well have suggested\r\nthe founding of a temple, and the placing of these symbols of peace\r\nand victory upon its altar.\r\n\r\nThe temple itself was built, together with the court, after the\r\nearthquake of 63, and at the time of the eruption the work was not\r\nentirely completed. The walls of the cella and of the entrance from\r\nthe Forum had received their veneering of marble and were in a\r\nfinished state; but those of the court, divided off into a series of\r\ndeep panels above which small pediments alternated with arches (Fig.\r\n45), had received only a rough coat of stucco and were still awaiting\r\ncompletion. The temple must have been built in the time of Vespasian,\r\nwho reigned from 68 to 79 A.D.; and as this emperor possessed too\r\ngreat simplicity of character to allow men to worship him as a god\r\nwhile he was still alive, it was probably dedicated to his Genius.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 46.--The temple of Vespasian, restored.]\r\n\r\nThe rooms at the rear of the temple (shown on the plan) were entered\r\nby a door at the right. They may have served as a habitation for the\r\nsacristan, or as a place of storage for the sacrificial utensils. The\r\nnorth room was also connected with rooms belonging to the sanctuary of\r\nthe Lares, the purpose of which is unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n_THE BUILDING OF EUMACHIA_\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 47.--Plan of the building of Eumachia.\r\n\r\n     1.

Remains of masonry.]\r\n\r\nThe plan of the large building on the east side of the Forum, between\r\nthe temple of Vespasian and Abbondanza Street, is simple and regular.\r\nIn front is a deep portico (1), facing the Forum. The interior\r\nconsists of a large oblong court with three apses at the rear and a\r\ncolonnade about the four sides (9); on three sides there is a corridor\r\nbehind the colonnade, with numerous windows opening upon it (12). The\r\ncorridor could be entered by three doors, two at the front end of the\r\ncourt, connecting with the colonnade, and a third at the rear,\r\nentered from the end of a passage leading up from Abbondanza Street\r\n(14), the grade of which at this point is considerably below the\r\npavement of the building (Fig. 50).\r\n\r\nAn inscription appears in large letters on the entablature of the portico,\r\nand again on a marble tablet over the side entrance in Abbondanza\r\nStreet: _Eumachia L. f., sacerd[os] publ[ica], nomine suo et M.\r\nNumistri Frontonis fili chalcidicum, cryptam, porticus Concordiae\r\nAugustae Pietati sua pequnia fecit eademque dedicavit_,--'Eumachia,\r\ndaughter of Lucius Eumachius, a city priestess, in her own name and\r\nthat of her son, Marcus Numistrius Fronto, built at her own expense\r\nthe portico, the corridor (_cryptam_, covered passage), and the\r\ncolonnade, dedicating them to Concordia Augusta and Pietas.'\r\n\r\nThe word _pietas_, in such connections, has no English equivalent, and\r\nis difficult to translate. It sums up in a single concept the\r\nqualities of filial affection, conscientious devotion, and obedience\r\nto duty which in the Roman view characterized the proper conduct of\r\nchildren toward their parents and grandparents. Here mother and son\r\nunited in dedicating the building to personifications, or\r\ndeifications, of the perfect harmony and the regard for elders that\r\nprevailed in the imperial family.\r\n\r\nThe reference of the dedication can only be to the relation between\r\nthe Emperor Tiberius and his mother Livia; it cannot apply to Nero and\r\nAgrippina, for the reason that the walls of the building were\r\ndecorated in the third Pompeian style, which in Nero's time was no\r\nlonger in vogue. In 22 A.D., when Livia was very ill, the Senate voted\r\nto erect an altar to Pietas Augusta. In the following year Drusus, the\r\nson of Tiberius, gave expression to his regard for his grandmother by\r\nplacing her likeness upon his coins, with the word Pietas.\r\n\r\nOn the coins of colonies also--of Saragossa and another the name of\r\nwhich is not known--the Pietas Augusta appears, apparently about the\r\nsame time. Not long afterwards the harmonious relations between\r\nTiberius and his mother gave place to mutual suspicion and hostility;\r\nthe dedication therefore points to the earlier part of the reign of\r\nTiberius, and in this period the building was no doubt erected. The\r\nstatue of Concordia Augusta, a female figure with a gilded\r\ncornucopia, was found in the building; the head, which has not been\r\npreserved, probably bore the features of Livia. By this dedication the\r\nbuilding of Eumachia, as the Macellum later, was placed under the\r\nprotection of the imperial house.\r\n\r\nWhile the parts are enumerated in the dedicatory inscription, neither\r\nthe name of the building as a whole, nor the purpose, is mentioned. A\r\nhint of the latter, however, is found in another inscription. A broad\r\nniche (13) opens into the corridor at the rear, directly behind the\r\nlargest apse. Here stood a marble statue of a beautiful woman (Fig.\r\n255), now replaced by a cast; the original is in Naples. Upon the\r\npedestal we read: _Eumachiae L. f., sacerd[oti] publ[icae],\r\nfullones_,--'Dedicated to Eumachia, daughter of Lucius Eumachius, a\r\ncity priestess, by the fullers.'\r\n\r\nThis building, in which the fullers had set up, in a specially\r\nprominent place, a statue of the person who had erected it, must in\r\nsome way have served the purposes of their trade. Clearly enough it\r\nwas not a fullery; on the other hand, it was well adapted for a\r\nclothier's exchange, a bazaar for the sale of cloth and articles of\r\nclothing. Tables and other furniture for the convenience of dealers\r\ncould be placed in the colonnade and the corridor; in the corridor,\r\nespecially, goods exposed for sale in front of the open windows could\r\nbe conveniently inspected by prospective buyers,--not only by those in\r\nthe corridor itself, but also by those looking in from the colonnade.\r\nThe small doors between the corridor and the colonnade could be\r\nsecurely closed, and the entrance from Abbondanza Street could be\r\neasily guarded; there was only a narrow door at the end of the passage\r\nopening into the corridor, and at the street entrance was a porter's\r\nroom connected by doors both with the passage and with the street.\r\nThis evidence of unusual precaution suggests that possibly the side\r\nentrance, from its close connection with the corridor, was intended\r\nespecially for the conveyance of goods to and from the building, in\r\norder that the front entrance might be left for the exclusive use of\r\npurchasers and dealers.\r\n\r\nOn the assumption that the building was a cloth market, it is clear\r\nthat the colonnade would naturally be open at all times, the corridor\r\nonly during business hours; after business hours the corridor would be\r\nclosed for the protection of the goods left there over night. The\r\nwindows may have been closed with shutters as in the Oriental bazaars.\r\nOther peculiarities of arrangement also are cleared up by this\r\nexplanation, but we cannot present them in detail. It is not possible,\r\nhowever, to make out what the purpose was of certain remains of\r\nmasonry found on the south side of the court (18) which have now\r\ndisappeared, or of two rectangular elevations at the rear (17), or,\r\nfinally, of a large stone in the middle of the court in which a\r\nmovable iron ring is fastened (15). Our information is so scanty that\r\nwe are unable to determine in all particulars what the requirements of\r\na fuller's exchange might have been.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the eruption men were still engaged in rebuilding the\r\nparts of the edifice that had suffered in the earthquake of 63. The\r\nfront wall at the rear of the portico was finished and had received\r\nits veneering of marble; as shown by the existing remains, it\r\nconformed to the plan of the earlier structure. The columns and\r\nentablature of the portico had not yet been set in place; considerable\r\nportions of them were found in the area of the Forum. The wall at the\r\nrear of the court, with the three apses, had been rebuilt, and the\r\nworkmen had begun to add the marble covering. The other walls had\r\nremained standing at the time of the earthquake; but the colonnade had\r\nbeen thrown down and was now in process of erection. The remains of\r\nthe colonnade were removed in ancient times, probably soon after the\r\ndestruction of the city; yet from the parts that remain, both of the\r\nold building and of the restorations, we can determine the\r\narchitectural character with certainty. We give two reconstructions of\r\nthe interior, one showing the front (Fig. 48), the other the rear\r\n(Fig. 49).\r\n\r\nThe colonnade and the portico were characterized by the same\r\npeculiarity of construction: they were in two stories, one above the\r\nother, but there was no upper floor corresponding with the\r\nintermediate entablature. In the case of the portico this is certain\r\nfrom the treatment of the wall at the rear, the ornamentation of which\r\nis carried without interruption high above the level of the\r\nentablature. If the appearance of this building alone had been taken\r\ninto account, it would have been simpler and more effective to place\r\nat the front of the portico a single order of large columns the height\r\nof which should correspond with that of the facade; but as the\r\ncolonnade about the Forum was in two stories, the front of the portico\r\nwas made to conform to it. The columns below were of the Doric, those\r\nabove of the Ionic, order. The material--whitish limestone--was the\r\nsame as that used in the new colonnade of the Forum. Nevertheless, by\r\nthe skilful handling of details a certain individuality was given to\r\nthe columns; while in general appearance they harmonized with those\r\nabout the Forum, the portico as a whole stood out by itself as\r\nsomething distinct and characteristic.\r\n\r\nThe columns of the portico were left unfluted, as were those of the\r\nnew Forum colonnade, and were of the same height; but their\r\nproportions were more slender, their ornamental forms were slightly\r\ndifferent, and they were set closer together. The pains and skill\r\nmanifested in harmonizing the particular with the general\r\narchitectural effect reflect much credit upon the Pompeian board of\r\npublic works. Under the portico at the foot of each column was a\r\nstatue, facing the front of the building; the pedestals, which still\r\nremain, assist in determining the places of the columns, of which only\r\none was found in position. The spaces between the columns could be\r\nclosed by latticed gates, as may be seen from traces of them remaining\r\nin the marble pavement at the south end of the portico; the pavement\r\nelsewhere has disappeared.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 48.--The building of Eumachia: front of the court,\r\n   restored.]\r\n\r\nThe wall at the rear of the portico, facing the Forum, was richly\r\nornamented. The broad entrance in the middle (6) was bridged at the\r\ntop by a lintel. At the ends are two large niches more than four feet\r\nabove the pavement (5), both reached by flights of steps. Between each\r\nof these and the doorway is a large apsidal arched niche (4) extending\r\ndown to the pavement. Lastly in the projecting portions of the wall\r\nare four smaller niches for statues. The whole facade was overlaid\r\nwith various kinds of colored marbles.\r\n\r\nNone of the statues have been found, but the inscriptions belonging to\r\nthe two that stood in the small niches at the left are extant and of\r\nspecial interest; the names of the persons represented, Aeneas and\r\nRomulus, are given, together with a short enumeration of their heroic\r\ndeeds. These statues were evidently copies; the originals formed a\r\npart of a famous series in Rome.\r\n\r\nAugustus set up in his Forum the statues of renowned Roman generals\r\nwith inscriptions setting forth their services to the State; in this\r\nway, he said, the people might obtain a standard of comparison for\r\nhimself and his successors. At the beginning of the series were\r\nAeneas, the kings of Alba Longa, and Romulus. Not one of these statues\r\nhas been preserved, but some of the inscriptions have been found in\r\nRome, while others are known from copies discovered in Arezzo, where\r\nwithout doubt, as at Pompeii, they were set up with copies of the\r\nstatues--a forcible illustration of the striving of the smaller cities\r\nto be like Rome. Two other statues, perhaps representing Julius Caesar\r\nand Augustus, stood in the niches at the right corresponding with\r\nthose of Aeneas and Romulus; it is not probable that the rest of the\r\nseries in Rome was duplicated here, because the remaining pedestals in\r\nthe portico were all designed for figures of larger size.\r\n\r\nThe colonnade about the court was of marble. The front part, as one\r\nentered from the portico, was higher than that on the sides and rear\r\n(Fig. 48); it must have presented a fine architectural effect. The two\r\nseries of Corinthian columns, one above the other, reached the height\r\nof 30 feet; the wall behind was diversified with niches and completely\r\ncovered with marble. At the right and at the left one could pass down\r\nthe sides under the colonnade, or through small doors into the\r\ncorridor. The walls between the colonnade and the corridor, pierced\r\nwith large windows, were decorated below with a dado of colored\r\nmarbles and above with painting upon stucco, in the third style.\r\n\r\nThe two smaller apsidal niches at the rear were no higher than the\r\ncolonnade, but the central apse projected above and terminated in a\r\nmarble pediment (Fig. 49), fragments of which are still to be seen in\r\nthe building. It was entered through three arched doorways, above\r\nwhich apparently there were windows. The image of Concordia Augusta,\r\nwith the features of Livia, probably stood on the pedestal at the rear\r\nof the apse, while the statues of Tiberius and Drusus may have adorned\r\nthe niches at the sides.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 49.--Rear of the court of the building of\r\n   Eumachia, restored.]\r\n\r\nWe can readily see why the colonnade was made so high, and in two\r\nstories, when a lower structure would have afforded better protection\r\nagainst sun and rain. Had it been limited to the usual height the\r\ncorridor behind it would have been too dark; and if instead of a\r\ndouble series of small columns, one above the other, there had been a\r\nsingle series of large columns of the usual proportions, the thickness\r\nof the latter would have shut out much light and have made the\r\ncolonnade seem less roomy. The arrangement adopted had the further\r\nadvantage that it harmonized the aspect of the colonnade with that of\r\nthe portico, the character of which, as we have seen, was determined\r\nby that of the colonnade about the Forum.\r\n\r\nThe small rooms of irregular shape at the sides of the apse (11) were\r\nlight courts, left open to the sky in order to furnish light to the\r\ncorridor at the rear, which was shut off from the colonnade.\r\n\r\nThe corridor was about fourteen feet in height; its walls still have\r\nremains of decoration in the third style.\r\n\r\nAt the right of the broad niche (13), in which the statue of Eumachia\r\nwas found, a door opened into the passage leading from Abbondanza\r\nStreet; in the corresponding position at the left, where there was no\r\nentrance, a door was painted upon the wall. This is a folding door in\r\nthree parts, of a kind quite common at Pompeii; the middle part is\r\nhung by means of hinges, like those on doors of the present day,\r\nfastened to one of the leaves at the sides, while these are\r\nrepresented as swinging on pivots at the top and the bottom.\r\n\r\nA stairway at the southeast corner of the corridor, over the entrance\r\nfrom Abbondanza Street, led to an upper room. A similar stairway was\r\nplaced in the last of the little rooms between the court and the\r\nportico, at the left of the front entrance. The upper rooms, difficult\r\nto reach, could hardly have been intended for salesrooms. They must\r\nhave been low, probably no higher than the difference between the\r\nheight of the colonnade and that of the corridor. They were most\r\nlikely used as temporary storerooms for the goods of the dealers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 50.--Fountain of Concordia Augusta.\r\n\r\n   In the background, steps in the side entrance of the Eumachia\r\n   building.]\r\n\r\nIn front of the entrance from Abbondanza Street, is a fountain of the\r\nordinary Pompeian form; as the material is limestone it is probably of\r\nlater date than the other fountains, which are generally of basalt. As\r\nmay be seen in our illustration (Fig. 50), the inlet pipe was carried\r\nby a broad standard projecting above the edge of the basin, on the\r\nfront of which a bust of a female figure with a cornucopia is carved\r\nin relief. The right side of the face has been worn away by eager\r\ndrinkers pressing their mouths against the mouth of the figure, whence\r\nthe jet issued; it reminds one of the attenuated right foot of the\r\nfamous bronze St. Peter in Rome. Hands also have worn deep, polished\r\nhollows in the stone on either side of the standard. The figure\r\nrepresents Concordia Augusta, but the name Abundantia, given to it\r\nwhen first discovered, still lingers in the Italian name for the\r\nstreet, which might more appropriately have been called Strada della\r\nConcordia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n_THE COMITIUM_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last building on the east side of the Forum, south of Abbondanza\r\nStreet, had undergone a complete transformation a short time before\r\nthe destruction of the city. Before the rebuilding, a row of pillars\r\nseparated the interior of the structure from the Forum and from the\r\nstreet. At the edge of the sidewalk along the latter are square holes\r\nopposite the pillars (shown on the plan, Fig. 51), evidently designed\r\nfor the insertion of posts, so that a temporary barrier of some sort\r\ncould be set up. The end of the space within the barrier where this\r\ncame to the Forum, and of the rest of the street as well, could be\r\nshut off by latticed gates.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 51.--Plan of the Comitium.\r\n\r\n     1. Recess opening on the main room.\r\n     2. Recess opening on the Forum.]\r\n\r\nIf the barrier were set up, and the latticed gate at the Forum end\r\nleft open, the building and the space within the barrier would be shut\r\noff from Abbondanza Street, but closely connected with the Forum by\r\nthe numerous entrances. After the rebuilding only two entrances from\r\nthe Forum were left, and one from Abbondanza Street.\r\n\r\nIt is altogether unlikely that so large a building, of irregular shape\r\nand with pillars on two sides, was provided with a roof; we have here\r\nan open space rather, serving as an extension of the Forum. The walls\r\nwere covered with marble and adorned with niches, in which, without\r\ndoubt, statues were placed. On the south side is a large recess the\r\nfloor of which, reached by a flight of steps, forms a kind of platform\r\nor tribune about four feet above the pavement of the enclosure (1). A\r\nsmall door at the right leads into a narrow room containing a similar\r\nplatform opening on the colonnade of the Forum (2), and to all\r\nappearances once accessible from it by steps; afterwards both the\r\nsteps and the tribune were walled up.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of these tribunes, and of the building as a whole, is far\r\nfrom clear. An analogy, however, suggests itself. On one side of the\r\nRoman Forum near the upper end was a small rectangular open space\r\ncalled the Comitium, used in early times as a voting place. Between\r\nthe Forum and the Comitium was originally a speaker's platform, the\r\nRostra, so placed that orators by turning toward one side could\r\naddress an audience in the Comitium and facing about could harangue\r\nthe Forum. Though the later changes have obscured the original form of\r\nour building, yet it is plain that at one time there must have been\r\ntwo connected tribunes, one facing the Forum, the other the enclosed\r\nopen space; we may at least hazard the conjecture that the colonists\r\nof Sulla, taking the arrangements of the capital as their pattern in\r\nall things, designed this place as their Comitium.\r\n\r\nThe enclosure was too small to admit of its use for voting according\r\nto the ancient fashion, but general elections in the Comitium had long\r\nbeen a thing of the past; only the unimportant curiate elections were\r\nheld there, at which each curia was represented by a lictor, and at\r\nother times the place was used for judicial proceedings. So our\r\nbuilding was probably used, if not for elections, for formalities\r\npreliminary to the elections and for business connected with the\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n_THE MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS_\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the south end of the Forum were three buildings similar in plan and\r\nclosely connected. In front they presented a common facade, the narrow\r\nspaces between them being entered by low doors. The building at the\r\nright (Fig. 52, 3) was at the corner of the Forum, while the space\r\nseparating the other two lay on a line dividing the Forum into two\r\nequal parts; east of the last building is the Strada delle Scuole.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 52.--Plan of the Municipal Buildings.\r\n\r\n     1. Office of the duumvirs.\r\n     2. Hall of the city council.\r\n     3. Office of the aediles.]\r\n\r\nThe three buildings were erected after the earthquake of 63, on the\r\nsite of older buildings of the same character. In the walls of that\r\nfurthest east (1), considerable remains of the earlier walls are\r\nembodied; in that near the corner the original pavement is preserved,\r\nand in the middle building there are traces of the original pavement.\r\nPrevious to this rebuilding the inner series of columns belonging to\r\nthe colonnade about the Forum had in part been removed and a barrier\r\nset up, by which the space in front of the middle building and that at\r\nthe left could be shut off (indicated on the plan by broken lines). At\r\nthe time of the eruption only the building at the left (1) was\r\nentirely finished. The others still lacked their decoration on both\r\ninner and outer walls.\r\n\r\nThese three spacious halls must have served the purposes of the city\r\nadministration. The two at the right and the left are alike in having\r\nat the end opposite the entrance an apse large enough to accommodate\r\none or more magistrates with their attendants; they were the official\r\nquarters of the aediles and the duumvirs, while the middle hall was\r\nthe council chamber, _curia_, where the decurions met.\r\n\r\nThe middle room was obviously intended to be the most richly\r\nornamented of the three, and was further distinguished from the others\r\nby the elevation of its floor, which was more than two feet above the\r\npavement of the colonnade. In front of the entrance is a platform\r\nreached at either end by an approach hardly wide enough for two\r\npersons, thus suited for a select rather than a large attendance.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 53.--View of the south end of the Forum.\r\n\r\n   In the background, the ruins of the municipal buildings; in front of\r\n   these, the remains of the colonnade. In the middle ground the\r\n   pedestals of the statues of the imperial family.]\r\n\r\nAlong the sides within runs a ledge a little more than five feet above\r\nthe floor, on which rested a double series of columns, one above the\r\nother, serving both as ornament and as a support for a ceiling like\r\nthat of the temple of Jupiter. If we picture to ourselves the columns\r\nin place, the walls covered with marble, and a rich coffered ceiling\r\nabove, we are led to form a favorable idea of the recuperative powers\r\nof the city which set about the construction of such costly and\r\nsplendid buildings so soon after the terrible earthquake.\r\n\r\nThe recess at the rear was designed for a large shrine patterned after\r\nthe small shrines of the Lares and Penates in private houses. The\r\nPenates of the city were above all the emperor and his family. If this\r\nshrine had been finished, figures representing Vespasian, Titus, and\r\nDomitian would probably have been placed in it, facing the three\r\nCapitoline divinities in the temple of Jupiter at the other end of the\r\nForum.\r\n\r\nThe office of the aediles, situated at the corner of the colonnade and\r\nclose to the Basilica, and with no barrier to prevent ready access,\r\nwas particularly convenient for magistrates who, among other duties,\r\nwere charged with the maintenance of order and the enforcement of\r\nregulations in the markets. One or perhaps both aediles sat in the\r\napse; while the rear and middle parts of the room were reserved for\r\nthose who had business with them. The front part, lower than the rest\r\nby two steps (shown on the plan), may have served as a waiting room.\r\nAt the rear of the apse and in the walls at the sides were niches for\r\nthe statues of members of the imperial family and of those who had\r\nrendered important services to the city.\r\n\r\nAs the duumvirs not only sat as judges but also had in their hands the\r\nfinancial administration of the city, we can see why the hall set\r\naside for their use was the first to be rebuilt after the earthquake.\r\nThe magistrates, of course, sat in the apse, along the wall of which\r\nwas a ledge for statues. The strong front doors were fastened with\r\niron bolts, and there was also a latticed gate on the step in front of\r\nthe threshold; probably the archives of the duumviral office were kept\r\nwithin. The small side door at the right made it possible to enter and\r\nleave the building after business hours or at other times when the\r\nlarge doors were closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n_THE TEMPLE OF VENUS POMPEIANA_\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some years it had been known that a temple once stood in the\r\nrectangular block south of the strada della Marina; and in 1898\r\nworkmen excavating here began to uncover the massive foundations. When\r\nthe volcanic deposits had been removed it was seen that the court of\r\nthe temple, with the surrounding colonnade, occupied the whole area\r\nbetween the Basilica and the west wall of the long room now used as a\r\nMuseum. On the podium (Fig. 55) was found a part of a statuette of\r\nVenus, of the familiar type which represents the goddess as preparing\r\nto enter the bath; it was probably a votive offering set up by some\r\nworshipper. In the subterranean passageway entered near the southeast\r\ncorner (Fig. 54, IV) the excavators found another votive offering, a\r\nbronze steering paddle of the kind shown in paintings as an attribute\r\nof Venus Pompeiana; an example may be seen in Fig. 4 (p. 12). From\r\nthese indications, as well as from the size of the temple and its\r\nlocation, near the Forum and on an elevation commanding a wide view of\r\nthe sea, we are safe in assigning the sanctuary to Venus Pompeiana,\r\nthe patron divinity of Roman Pompeii.\r\n\r\nPrior to the founding of the Roman colony the site of the temple had\r\nbeen occupied by houses, built in several stories on the edge of the\r\nhill, which here slopes sharply toward the southwest; remains of the\r\nhouses, which must have resembled those farther east (an example is\r\nthe house of the Emperor Joseph II, p. 344), have been brought to\r\nlight in the course of the excavations. In less than a century and a\r\nhalf the temple was twice built, twice destroyed; a third building was\r\nin progress at the time of the eruption.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 54.--Plan of the temple of Venus Pompeiana.\r\n\r\n     I, II.

Enlargement of podium for third temple.]\r\n\r\nThe first temple was erected in the early years of the Roman colony.\r\nAn area approximately 185 Roman feet square was prepared for it by\r\nlevelling off and filling up, terrace walls being built to hold in\r\nplace the earth and rubbish used for filling. The foundations of the\r\nwalls about the court (A-B, C-D-E) can still be traced except on the\r\nsouth side, where, perhaps in consequence of the earthquake at the\r\ntime of the eruption, every vestige has disappeared, and at the\r\nsouthwest corner, where excavations for building materials in modern\r\ntimes have been carried below the Roman level, a part of the\r\nfoundation of the temple itself having been removed. These walls\r\nconformed to the direction of the walls of the Basilica, the corners,\r\nas those of the Basilica, showing a noticeable divergence from a right\r\nangle.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 55.--Ruins of the temple of Venus Pompeiana,\r\n   viewed from the southeast.\r\n\r\n   At the right, foundation of the front row of columns of the latest\r\n   (unfinished) colonnade; then foundation of stylobate of earlier\r\n   colonnade, with gutter. In foreground, entrance to subterranean\r\n   passage. On the podium of the temple at the farther end is seen the\r\n   pedestal of the statue of the divinity. The wall at the rear of the\r\n   court is on the south side of the strada della Marina.]\r\n\r\nThe front of the earlier colonnade is outlined by the gutter (F-G-G',\r\nG\"-H-I), constructed of blocks of tufa, which show signs of long use,\r\nand the foundation of the stylobate behind the gutter, which is\r\nplainly seen (Fig. 55); in places (as indicated in the plan), the\r\nlayer of mortar spread over this foundation shows the impressions made\r\nby the blocks of the stylobate which rested on it. At the middle of\r\nthe north side (G'-G\") both the gutter and the wall under the\r\nstylobate were removed when the foundations of the third temple were\r\nextended in that direction. Along the gutter were basins for water\r\nused in cleaning the floor of the court, which was made of fine\r\nconcrete. The entrance to the court was at the northeast corner.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of the court were six rooms, the rear of which was\r\nformed by the wall A'B'. Two of these opened on the colonnade in their\r\nwhole breadth, and four with narrow doors, the thresholds of which, of\r\nwhitish limestone, are still in place. Their purpose cannot be\r\ndetermined. The cross walls shown in the plan on the west side (_x_,\r\n_y_, _z_) belonged to an earlier building, and have nothing to do with\r\nthe temple.\r\n\r\nIn front of the temple are remains of a large altar of whitish\r\nlimestone (III). On the east side of the court is the base of an\r\nequestrian statue (V), of the same material, which was afterwards\r\nveneered with marble; near it is a pedestal of a standing figure (VI),\r\nof masonry covered with stucco, and behind this is the small base of a\r\nfountain figure. Near the southeast corner is the entrance (IV) to a\r\nsubterranean passageway which runs toward the south; it probably led\r\nto rooms of earlier houses which were preserved, when the area was\r\nfilled up, for the use of the attendants of the temple.\r\n\r\nThe temple itself, as the other edifices, religious and secular, of\r\nthe first years of the Roman colony, must have been built of common\r\nmaterials and coated with stucco. Of the existing remains only the\r\ninner part of the podium (I, II on the Plan) can be assigned to it; a\r\nseries of small blocks of tufa at the rear end is perhaps a remnant of\r\nthe cornice which was carried around the upper edge of the podium.\r\n\r\nTo the Pompeians of the Empire the modest structure of Republican days\r\nseemed unworthy of the tutelary divinity of their city. On the same\r\npodium they built a temple of marble. Of this are preserved the\r\nfoundations of the door posts of the cella (Fig. 56 _a_) and the core\r\nof the pedestal (D) on which stood the statue of the divinity, besides\r\nsome bits of the cella floor, which consisted of a border of white\r\nmosaic (_b_), a broad strip of pavement of small flags of colored\r\nmarble (_c_), and an ornamental centre (_a_) now entirely destroyed.\r\nThe only remains of the superstructure that can be identified are in a\r\nstoreroom north of the temple of Apollo. They consist of fragments of\r\nlarge marble columns, nearly thirty-two inches in diameter, and of an\r\nentablature of corresponding dimensions.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 56.--Plan of the second temple, restored.\r\n\r\n     A.

Pedestal of the statue of the divinity.\r\n     _a._ Door of cella.\r\n     _b._ Floor border of white mosaic.\r\n     _c._ Pavement of colored marbles.\r\n     _d._ Ornamental centre.]\r\n\r\nAfter the completion of the temple the Pompeians set about rebuilding\r\nthe colonnade, on a scale of equal magnificence. First of all they\r\nenlarged the court by removing the old walls to the foundations, and\r\nconstructed new outside walls (_a-b-c-d_), the corners of which\r\nform right angles. The wall on the north side, of reticulate work, can\r\nbe distinguished in Fig. 55. That on the east side is also well\r\npreserved, but of that on the south side no trace remains. The deep\r\nfoundation of the wall on the west side forms the farther wall of the\r\npresent Museum, the roof of which very nearly represents the level of\r\nthe floor of the ancient court. The colonnade was to be single on the\r\nnorth, double on the east and west sides. The principal entrance was\r\nat the northeast corner (K), with a smaller entrance (L) at the end of\r\nthe narrow street south of the Basilica.\r\n\r\nHow far the work had progressed before the earthquake of the year 63\r\nit is not easy to determine. The new gutter along the front of the\r\ncolonnade had not yet been laid, but the foundations of the rows of\r\ncolumns (_e-f-g-h_, _e'f'_, _g'h'_) were for the most part\r\nready. From the Corinthian capital and fragments of shafts and\r\nentablature lying about the court it is clear that these members were\r\nfitted and in place when they were thrown down. Part of the colonnade\r\nwas therefore finished. It was in two stories, probably without an\r\nintervening floor, like the porticoes in front of the Macellum and the\r\nbuilding of Eumachia. Not less than three hundred marble columns must\r\nhave been required to complete the work; undoubtedly the wall back of\r\nthe colonnade was divided off by pilasters below and half columns\r\nabove, the intervening spaces being filled with marble. In point of\r\nsize, the temple with its court formed the largest sanctuary, in\r\nrichness of materials the most splendid edifice of the entire city.\r\n\r\nThe great earthquake felled to the ground alike the finished temple\r\nand the unfinished colonnade. But the Pompeians, in their time of\r\ntrouble least of all disposed, we may assume, to forsake their patron\r\ngoddess, soon commenced the work of rebuilding. Postponing the renewal\r\nand completion of the colonnade as of secondary importance, they\r\ncleared away the debris of the temple, and on the podium where the\r\ncella had stood constructed a temporary place of worship, a small\r\nwooden building strengthened at the bottom by a low wall around the\r\noutside. Then they proceeded to enlarge the podium; the third temple\r\nwas to be even more imposing than its predecessor. The old steps were\r\nremoved from the front. The existing podium was cut back five Roman\r\nfeet on each side, and four inches at the rear, to form the core of\r\nthe new podium; on all sides of this a massive foundation wall was\r\ncommenced, five and a half Roman feet thick, made of large blocks of\r\nbasalt carefully worked and fitted. A similar wall was carried through\r\nthe old podium (~B~-~B'~), to serve as the foundation for the front wall\r\nof the cella. The relative size of the component parts of the new\r\ntemple is thus clearly indicated. The cella was to extend over the\r\nspace ~B~-~C~-~C'~-~B'~, the portico over that marked ~A~-~B~-~B'~; how\r\nfar the steps were to project in front is uncertain.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the eruption five courses of basalt had been laid,\r\nreaching a height of more than four feet, the space between the core\r\nof the old podium and the outer wall being filled with concrete as the\r\nwork progressed. On the north side of the court are still to be seen a\r\nnumber of blocks of basalt not yet trimmed and fitted, just as they\r\nwere abandoned by the workmen when the work was stopped forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n_THE TEMPLE OF FORTUNA AUGUSTA_\r\n\r\n\r\nPassing out from the Forum under the arch at the northeast corner, we\r\nenter the broadest street in Pompeii. On the right a colonnade over\r\nthe sidewalk runs along the front of the first block, at the further\r\ncorner of which, where Forum Street opens into Nola Street, stands the\r\nsmall temple of Fortuna Augusta. The front of the temple is in a line\r\nwith the colonnade, which seems to have been designed as a\r\ncontinuation of the colonnade about the Forum; the builders apparently\r\nwished to have it appear that the temple was located on an extension\r\nof the Forum rather than on a street. The colonnade is certainly not\r\nolder than the earlier years of the Empire, and the temple dates from\r\nthe time of Augustus.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 57.--Plan of the temple of Fortuna Augusta.\r\n\r\n     A. Altar.\r\n     B. Portico.\r\n     C. Cella.\r\n     D. Shrine for the statue of the divinity.\r\n     1-4. Niches for statues.]\r\n\r\nThe divinity of the temple and the name of its builder are both known\r\nto us from an inscription on the architrave of the shrine at the rear\r\nof the cella: _M. Tullius M. f., d. v. i. d. ter., quinq[uennalis],\r\naugur, tr[ibunus] mil[itum] a pop[ulo], aedem Fortunae August[ae] solo\r\net peq[unia] sua_,--'Marcus Tullius the son of Marcus, duumvir with\r\njudiciary authority for the third time, quinquennial duumvir, augur,\r\nand military tribune by the choice of the people, (erected this)\r\ntemple to Fortuna Augusta on his own ground and at his own expense.'\r\n\r\nSuch inscriptions were ordinarily placed on the entablature of the\r\nportico. The portico of this temple, however, had been thrown down by\r\nthe earthquake of 63, and had not yet been rebuilt. The cella may have\r\nbeen damaged also, but in order that the worship might not be\r\ninterrupted the shrine was restored; the inscription was temporarily\r\nplaced over it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 58.--Temple of Fortuna Augusta, restored.]\r\n\r\nThe remains of the walls, columns, and entablature make it possible to\r\nreconstruct the edifice with certainty (Fig. 58). The plan (Fig. 57)\r\nin several respects closely resembles that of the temple of Jupiter,\r\nfrom which the architect copied the projecting platform in front of\r\nthe podium, with its altar and double series of steps. The eight\r\ncolumns sustaining the portico had Corinthian capitals. The walls of\r\nthe cella were veneered with marble. In the shrine at the rear stood,\r\nwithout doubt, the image of Fortuna as guardian of the fortunes of\r\nAugustus and protectress of the imperial family (Fig. 59).\r\n\r\nThere were also in the walls of the cella four niches for statues, of\r\nwhich two have been found. The face of one, a female figure, had been\r\nsawed off in order to replace it with another, which has not come to\r\nlight; the features of the other statue were said in the reports of\r\nthe excavations to resemble those of Cicero, but the resemblance is\r\npurely fanciful, suggested by the name Marcus Tullius in the\r\ndedicatory inscription. Both statues were of persons connected with\r\nthe priesthood, not of members of the imperial family. Probably\r\nstatues of the latter were set up elsewhere, so that the cella was\r\nleft free for less important personages.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 59.--Rear of the cella in the temple of Fortuna\r\n   Augusta, with the statue of the goddess, restored.]\r\n\r\nThe worship of Fortuna Augusta was in charge of a college of priests,\r\nconsisting of four slaves and freedmen, who were called _Ministri\r\nFortunae Augustae_,--'Servants of Fortuna Augusta.' Our information in\r\nregard to them is derived from five inscriptions, of which two were\r\nfound in the temple, the others in different places; but none of them\r\nwhere they originally belonged. These all relate to the small statues,\r\n_signa_, of which one was set up by the college every year. One\r\ninscription, of the year 3 B.C., speaks of the 'first servants\r\n(_ministri primi_) of Fortuna Augusta.' The priesthood was therefore\r\nestablished in that year, and the temple was probably built only a\r\nshort time before.\r\n\r\nIn donating the land for the temple Tullius retained the ownership of\r\na narrow strip of irregular shape at the right. Here a rough block of\r\nbasalt was set up with the inscription: _M. Tulli M. f. area\r\nprivata_,--'Private property belonging to Marcus Tullius, son of\r\nMarcus.'\r\n\r\n\r\nKEY TO PLAN III\r\n\r\n     A.

On the edge of the spur at the left a temple of the\r\nDoric style was built in very early times. The descent here, toward\r\nthe southwest, is so sharp and the height so great that it was not\r\nnecessary to add a wall at the top as a means of defence.\r\n\r\nThe sides of the temple followed in general the direction of the edge\r\nof the cliff. Raised upon a high foundation, it not only dominated the\r\nplain below but was visible also from the greater part of the city;\r\nglistening in the sun, it became a landmark for mariners far out at\r\nsea, who from a distance could offer greetings to the gods there\r\nenshrined.\r\n\r\nIn the second century B.C. the northwest corner of the depression back\r\nof the Stabian Gate was selected as the site for a large theatre (E on\r\nPlan III); previously, we may suppose, temporary wooden structures had\r\nanswered the purpose. This location was chosen, in accordance with the\r\nGreek custom, because the places for the greater part of the seats for\r\nthe spectators could be easily cut in the natural slope, which here\r\nhad the shape of half a shallow saucer; a superstructure was necessary\r\nonly for the upper rows of seats. The architect, if not a Greek, was\r\ncertainly of Greek training.\r\n\r\nSouth of the theatre an extensive colonnade (G) was erected. It was\r\nintended as a shelter for theatre-goers, but was afterwards turned\r\ninto barracks for gladiators.\r\n\r\nWith a similar purpose, a colonnade of the Doric order was built along\r\ntwo sides of the triangular level space about the Greek temple (1).\r\nIn front of the north end, where the two arms of the colonnade meet, a\r\nhigh portico of the Ionic order was erected (A) facing the street,\r\nthus forming a monumental entrance to the Theatre. The southwest side\r\nof the area was left unobstructed, and the place, by reason of its\r\nshape, is called the Forum Triangulare, 'Three-cornered Forum.'\r\n\r\nIn connection with the building of the Theatre land had been\r\nexpropriated and cleared as far north as the first east and west\r\nstreet. Here, near the entrance of the Forum Triangulare, a Palaestra\r\nfor gymnastic exercises (C) was built, with funds left for public\r\npurposes by a benevolent citizen. Later, probably not before the time\r\nof the Roman colony, a temple of Isis (I) was erected, adjoining the\r\nTheatre on the northeast.\r\n\r\nEarly in the Roman Period, not long after 80 B.C., a small roofed\r\ntheatre (F) was constructed east of the stage of the Large Theatre and\r\nof the area at the rear.\r\n\r\nStabian Street north and south of the Small Theatre was lined with\r\nprivate houses. At the northeast corner of the block was a temple of\r\nZeus Milichius (H), seemingly of early date, but entirely rebuilt\r\nabout the time that the Small Theatre was erected.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPart of the columns and entablature belonging to the beautiful portico\r\nat the entrance of the Forum Triangulare have been set up again and\r\nare seen in our illustration (Fig. 60). The brackets projecting from\r\nthe rear wall were probably designed for statuettes or vases. When the\r\nwall was rebuilt, after the earthquake of 63, a change was made in at\r\nleast one particular. The small doorway at the middle, now at right\r\nangles with the wall, formerly passed obliquely through it, opening\r\ntoward the end of the promenade which was laid out in front of the\r\ncolonnade at the left. This promenade (2 on Plan III) was separated\r\nfrom the area of the Forum by a low wall; on sunny winter days it must\r\nhave been the most frequented walk in the city.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE III.--THE GREEK TEMPLE AND THE FORUM TRIANGULARE,\r\n   SEEN FROM THE SOUTH. RESTORATION BY WEICHARDT]\r\n\r\nBesides the small doorway, which was closed by a latticed gate hung\r\nfrom a wooden jamb, there was at the left a massive double door\r\nwith strong bolts, inside of which was still a second door. It seems\r\nodd that one entrance should be so securely closed, while the\r\nfastenings of the other were so light. Ordinarily, the large doors\r\nmust have been kept shut, while the small entrance was left open for\r\neveryday use; but when there was to be a play in the Theatre, and the\r\nmagistrate who gave the entertainment proceeded from the Forum with a\r\nretinue in festal attire, then the great doors were swung back in\r\nhonor of the occasion, and the opening of them formed part of an\r\nimpressive ceremony.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 60.--Portico at the entrance of the Forum\r\n   Triangulare.]\r\n\r\nThe colonnade within contained ninety-five Doric columns. It was only\r\none story in height, and the columns for this reason are more slender\r\nthan those of the same order in the Forum. The entablature varies from\r\nthe Doric type only in respect to the architrave, which consists of\r\ntwo bands. The continuation of the colonnade along the southwest side\r\nwas prevented by the nearness of the temple to the edge of the cliff.\r\nHere the magnificent view over the plain to the mountains and across\r\nthe Bay was unimpeded; for the enjoyment of it, two duumvirs in the\r\nearly years of the Empire built near the west corner of the temple a\r\nsemicircular stone seat, _schola_ (4 on Plan III), like those found in\r\nconnection with tombs. On the back they placed a sundial with the\r\ninscription: _L. Sepunius L. f. Sandilianus, M. Herennius A. f.\r\nEpidianus duo vir[i] i. d. scol[am] et horol[ogium] d. s. p. f. c._\r\n(for _de sua pecunia faciundum curarunt_),--'Lucius Sepunius\r\nSandilianus the son of Lucius, and Marcus Herennius Epidianus the son\r\nof Aulus, duumvirs with judiciary authority, caused the seat and the\r\nsundial to be made at their own expense.' The same duumvirs, as we\r\nhave seen, set up a sundial in the court of the temple of Apollo.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 61.--View of the Forum Triangulare, looking toward\r\n   Vesuvius.\r\n\r\n   At the left, remains of the Doric temple and of the altars and well\r\n   house in front of it; at the right, exterior of the large theatre.]\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the middle column at the north end of the colonnade is\r\na broad basin of Carrara marble resting on a finely proportioned,\r\nfluted standard; a jet of water fell into it from the end of a pipe\r\nwhich passed through the column above. A little further forward is a\r\npedestal (8) veneered with marble on which is the inscription: _M.\r\nClaudio C. f. Marcello patrono_,--'To Marcus Claudius Marcellus, the\r\nson of Gaius, patron.' Here stood a statue of Marcellus, the nephew of\r\nAugustus, a portrait statue of whom we have already found in the\r\nimperial chapel of the Macellum. The reason why he was honored with\r\nmore than one statue is clear from the inscription before us: he was\r\npatron of the colony.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the Forum Triangulare was considerably higher than the\r\ntop of the city wall (K) south of the barracks of the Gladiators. It\r\nseems likely that a flight of steps led down to the wall between the\r\nbarracks and the long colonnade, as seen in Weichardt's restoration\r\n(Plate III). This explanation accounts for the existence of certain\r\nremains of walls (L on the plan), the purpose of which is otherwise\r\nobscure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the ancient Doric temple but little remains: only the foundation,\r\nwhich was high for a Greek temple, with a flight of steps in front;\r\ntwo stumps of columns and traces of a third; four capitals, and\r\nportions of the right wall of the cella. The plan of the cella,\r\nhowever, has been traced by means of excavations.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 62.--Plan of the Doric temple in the Forum\r\n   Triangulare.\r\n\r\n     1. Colonnade.\r\n     2. Outer chamber of cella.\r\n     3. Inner chamber of cella.\r\n     4. Semicircular bench, with sundial.\r\n     5. Sepulchral enclosure.\r\n     6. Altars.\r\n     7. Well house.]\r\n\r\nThe foundation, unlike the podiums of the other temples at Pompeii,\r\nwas built up in a series of broad, high steps. The number of the\r\ncolumns, eleven on the sides and seven in front, as in the temple of\r\nZeus at Agrigentum, has been calculated from the distances between the\r\nstumps. Of those in front two were opposite the corners of the cella,\r\nwhere the edges of the flight of steps come to the stylobate (Fig.\r\n62). Only a narrow space was needed between the walls of the cella and\r\nthe surrounding columns, but in order to make the outward appearance\r\nmore imposing the columns were set as far out as they would have been\r\nif a second series had been placed within, between them and the cella;\r\naccording to the classification of Vitruvius the temple was a\r\npseudodipteral. On account of the interval thus afforded between the\r\nentrance of the cella and the columns in front (a little over sixteen\r\nfeet), it was thought proper to leave the number of columns uneven, so\r\nthat one stood over against the middle of the doorway.\r\n\r\nThe temple was of mixed construction, part stone and part wood. The\r\nentablature must have been of stone, otherwise the intercolumniations\r\nwould not have been so narrow. The space between the entablature and\r\nthe cella, however, could only have been bridged by means of timbers.\r\nThe stone used was the gray tufa, but the capitals were of the more\r\ndurable Sarno limestone. The surface was coated with stucco, which in\r\npart at least was painted in bright colors. The projecting edge of the\r\neaves trough, also covered with stucco, was painted red, yellow, and\r\nblack, and ornamented with waterspouts in the shape of lions' heads\r\nalternating with rosettes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 63.--The Doric temple, restored.]\r\n\r\nThe proportions of the columns (lower diameter 6.07 feet, upper\r\ndiameter 3.12 feet) with their flaring capitals, and the narrow\r\nintercolumniations (Fig. 63), point to an early period; the archaic\r\ncharacter of the capitals will be more fully appreciated if they are\r\ncompared with those of the colonnade of the Forum Triangulare. In\r\nrespect to age this temple ranks with the oldest of those at\r\nSelinunto; it must have been built in the sixth century B.C.\r\n\r\nThe cella, as our plan shows, was divided into two chambers. In the\r\ninner chamber (3) a large rectangular flag is embedded in the floor at\r\none side so that a second (indicated on the plan by dotted lines) must\r\nhave been near it; the supports of a stone table in front of the image\r\nof the divinity perhaps rested on them. On the long pedestal at the\r\nright of the cella stood a deer of terra cotta, above life size, of\r\nwhich some fragments have been found.\r\n\r\nDirectly in front of the temple, at the foot of the steps, we find a\r\nmonument of an altogether unusual character. The respect with which it\r\nwas regarded is evidenced by its location in the place ordinarily\r\noccupied by the principal altar. It consists of a small enclosure of\r\npeculiar shape, fenced in by an outer wall and a low inner wall. To\r\njudge from its form, it must have been a place of burial; we shall\r\nfind a tomb later the plan of which is quite similar (Plan V, right\r\nside, 2), and it is said that human bones were found here. These walls\r\nare not earlier than the imperial period, but they must have taken the\r\nplace of an older structure; for the altars were evidently put over\r\nnear the east corner of the temple (6 on the plan), because the place\r\nwhich they would naturally have had was already occupied. For a\r\ntime--how long it would be idle to conjecture--this was beyond doubt\r\nthe most important temple of the city; the placing of the tomb in the\r\nmost sacred spot in front of it suggests that the founder or founders\r\nof the city may have been buried here, and afterwards revered as\r\nheroes.\r\n\r\nInstead of a single altar in front of the temple there are three, all\r\nmade of blocks of tufa, two of them resting on a single foundation;\r\nthe third is built on the ground without a foundation, and is of later\r\ndate. One altar is larger than the other two, and its surface is\r\ndivided into three parts.\r\n\r\nNot far from the altars are the remains of a small round structure (7\r\non the plan, shown in Fig. 61) about twelve feet in diameter. The\r\nroof, supported by eight Doric columns, was over the mouth of a well,\r\nwhich had been driven down through the old lava bed till living water\r\nwas found for cleaning the temple and for religious rites. According\r\nto the Oscan inscription on the architrave the well house was built by\r\nN. Trebius, chief administrative officer (_meddix tuticus_) of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to determine what divinities were worshipped here.\r\nThe placing of two altars together, one being divided into three\r\nparts, and the addition of a third, seem to imply that three\r\ndivinities received worship in common, and that besides these two\r\nother gods were honored in this sanctuary. The terra cotta deer\r\nfurnishes a clew, but is not decisive evidence; deer were sacred to\r\nseveral divinities, among others to Apollo and Artemis. A marble\r\ntorso of about half life size, found on the declivity south of the\r\ntemple, has been identified with some degree of probability as\r\nbelonging to a statue of Apollo. Perhaps originally Apollo and Artemis\r\nwere honored here, and with them Leto; but in an Oscan inscription\r\ndiscovered in 1897 the temple seems to be designated as belonging to\r\nMinerva (p. 240), who was perhaps also worshipped with them.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the eruption the temple was in ruins. It may have been\r\nin this condition only since the earthquake of 63, or for a longer\r\ntime. That the worship might not be abandoned a poor shrine was built\r\namong the ruins, smaller than the old cella and a little further to\r\nthe right; a drum of a column, set up on the flag in the floor of the\r\ncella, served as a pedestal for the image of the divinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n_THE LARGE THEATRE_\r\n\r\n\r\nPerformances upon the stage were first given in Rome in the year 364\r\nB.C.; a pestilence was raging, and the Romans thought to appease the\r\ngods by a new kind of celebration in their honor. The performers were\r\nbrought from Etruria, and the exercises were limited to dancing, with\r\nan accompaniment on the flute. There was as yet no Latin drama. The\r\nfirst regular play was presented more than a century later, in 240\r\nB.C., and the playwright was not a Roman but a Greek from Tarentum,\r\nLivius Andronicus, who translated both tragedies and comedies from his\r\nnative tongue. The next dramatist was a Campanian, Gnaeus Naevius. The\r\nbuilding of a theatre was not yet thought of; a temporary wooden\r\nplatform was erected for the actors, and the spectators spread\r\nthemselves out on the green slope of a hillside facing it.\r\n\r\nWhen the censor Cassius Longinus in 154 B.C. commenced the erection of\r\na theatre on the Palatine hill near the temple of Cybele, at whose\r\nfestivals plays were given, the ex-consul Scipio Nasica rose in the\r\nSenate and in a speech full of feeling warned the Romans not to\r\ncountenance this foreign amusement, on the ground that it would sap\r\nthe foundations of the national character. His words produced so deep\r\nan impression that the Senate not only voted to pull down the part of\r\nthe building already erected, and to refuse permission for the\r\nerection of similar buildings in the future, but even prohibited\r\naltogether the renting of seats at theatrical representations; Romans\r\nwho wished to see a play must remain standing during a performance, or\r\nsit on the ground. Naturally so stringent measures could not long\r\nremain in force. Nine years later Mummius, the destroyer of Corinth,\r\npresented dramas in connection with his triumph, and put up wooden\r\nseats for the spectators. The first stone theatre in Rome was built by\r\nPompey, the rival of Caesar, in 55 B.C. In Pompeii, on the contrary, a\r\npermanent theatre had been erected at least a hundred years earlier.\r\n\r\nThe Oscan culture was so completely merged in that of Rome that our\r\nknowledge of it as an independent development is extremely slight; and\r\nno information has come down to us regarding the history of the native\r\ndrama. From literary sources we know only of a crude form of popular\r\ncomedy in which, as in the Italian Commedia dell' arte, there were\r\nstock characters distinguished by their masks,--Maccus a buffoon,\r\nBucco a voracious, talkative lout, Pappus an old man who is always\r\ncheated, and Dossennus a knave. The scene of these exhibitions was\r\nalways Atella, the Gotham of Campania, whence they were called Atellan\r\nfarces.\r\n\r\nThe Theatre at Pompeii, however, is a proof that as early as the\r\nsecond century B.C., in at least one Campanian city, dramatic\r\nrepresentations of a high order were given. Here, perhaps, as at\r\nAthens, they were associated with the worship of Dionysus; for the\r\nsatyrs were companions of the Wine-god, and the head of a satyr,\r\ncarved in tufa, still projects from the keystone of the arch at the\r\nouter end of one of the vaulted passages leading to the orchestra.\r\nGreek verse, and native verse modelled after the Greek, must have\r\ngained a hearing at Pompeii, and the works of Oscan poets--not a line\r\nof which has come down to us--must have stirred the hearts of the\r\npeople long before Livius Andronicus, and Naevius, who brought\r\ninspiration from his Campanian home, produced their dramas at Rome.\r\n\r\nIn describing the Theatre it will be best to take up in order the\r\nthree main divisions common to Greek and Roman buildings of this\r\nclass: the _cavea_, the large outer part shaped somewhat like half a\r\nfunnel, containing seats for spectators; the orchestra, the small\r\nsemicircular portion enclosed by the cavea, with an entrance,\r\n_parodos_, on either side; and the stage, facing the orchestra and the\r\ncavea. The accompanying illustrations give a plan (Fig. 64), and a\r\nview of the ruins in their present condition (Fig. 65); the exterior\r\nas seen from the south is shown in Fig. 61.\r\n\r\nThe cavea afforded seats for about five thousand persons. The greater\r\npart of it, from the orchestra to the vaulted corridor under the summa\r\ncavea (Fig. 64, 6), lies on the slope of the hill; the floor of the\r\ncorridor is on a level with the Forum Triangulare.\r\n\r\nThe seats are arranged in three semicircular sections. The lowest,\r\n_ima cavea_ (4), next to the orchestra, contains four broad ledges on\r\nwhich, as well as in the orchestra itself, the members of the city\r\ncouncil, the decurions, could place their chairs, the 'seats of double\r\nwidth.'\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 64.--Plan of the Large Theatre.\r\n\r\n     1. Dressing room.\r\n     2. Stage.\r\n     3. Orchestra.\r\n     4. Ima cavea.\r\n     5. Media cavea.\r\n     6. Summa cavea.\r\n     7. Tribunalia.\r\n     8. Tank for saffron water.]\r\n\r\nThe middle section, _media cavea_ (5), was much deeper, extending from\r\nthe ima cavea to the vaulted corridor. It contained twenty rows of\r\nmarble seats arranged like steps, of which only a small portion is\r\npreserved. On a part of one of these, individual places, a little less\r\nthan 16 inches wide, are marked off by vertical lines in front, and\r\nnumbered; they probably belonged to some corporation which found it\r\nnecessary, in order to avoid confusion, to assign places to its\r\nmembers by number. In Rome the fourteen rows nearest the bottom were\r\nreserved for the knights. Whether a similar arrangement prevailed in\r\nthe municipalities and the colonies is not known, but if so the number\r\nreserved here must have been smaller.\r\n\r\nThe upper section, _summa cavea_ (6), supported by the vault over the\r\ncorridor, was too narrow to have contained more than four rows of\r\nseats.\r\n\r\nThe ima cavea was entered from the orchestra. The media cavea could be\r\nentered on the lower side from the passage (_diazoma_, _praecinctio_)\r\nbetween it and the ima cavea, which at the ends was connected by short\r\nflights of steps with the parodoi leading outside; on the upper side\r\nsix doors opened into the media cavea from the corridor, from which\r\nflights of steps descended dividing the seats into five wedgelike\r\nblocks, _cunei_, with a small oblong block in addition on either side\r\nnear the end of the stage.\r\n\r\nThe corridor was accessible by four doors, one from the Forum\r\nTriangulare, another from the open space between this and the rounded\r\nexterior of the Theatre, a third at the end of an alley east of the\r\ntemple of Isis, and a fourth opening from a steep passage leading up\r\nfrom Stabian Street. The summa cavea, which for convenience we may\r\ncall the gallery, was entered by several doors (the exact number is\r\nuncertain) from a narrow vaulted passage along the outside. This\r\npassage, however, did not extend the whole length of the gallery, but\r\nstopped where the outer wall of the Theatre joined that of the Forum\r\nTriangulare. Here a stairway led to it; there was a second stairway at\r\nthe rear of the Palaestra, and a third leading from the alley east of\r\nthe temple of Isis; the three are shown on Plan III. At the edge of\r\nthe Forum Triangulare, a narrow stairway, built in the thick wall, led\r\ndirectly to the gallery (Fig. 64).\r\n\r\nThe outer wall back of the gallery rose to a considerable height above\r\nthe last row of seats. On the inside near the top were projecting\r\nblocks of basalt (seen in Fig. 65), containing round holes in which\r\nstrong wooden masts were set; from these the great awning, _velum_,\r\nwas stretched over the cavea and orchestra to the roof of the stage,\r\nprotecting the spectators from the sun. This sort of covering for the\r\ntheatre was a Campanian invention, and here, where the cavea opened\r\ntoward the south, was especially necessary. In the Coliseum, and the\r\nwell preserved theatre at Orange, the arrangements for fastening the\r\nmasts are on the outside of the wall. The upper part of the wall of\r\nour Theatre has been rebuilt in modern times, and it has been doubted\r\nwhether the blocks of basalt and the pieces of cornice above with\r\ncorresponding incisions are ancient; the latter surely are not modern,\r\nand their slightly wedged shape shows that from the beginning they\r\nmust have been on the inside of the wall.\r\n\r\nNear the front of the orchestra at the right and the left were small\r\nrectangular platforms; one is shown in Fig. 65. They were supported\r\nby the vaults over the entrances (7, 7), and were reached by small\r\nstairways near the ends of the stage. They were called tribunals, and\r\nhere, as in Rome, were no doubt reserved for the seats of those to\r\nwhom special honor was paid. One was set aside for the use of the\r\nmagistrate who gave the play; in Rome the vestal virgins, in\r\naccordance with a decree of Augustus, occupied the other, and in\r\nPompeii their place was very likely taken by the city priestesses.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 65.--View of the Large Theatre.]\r\n\r\nThe shape of the orchestra is that of a semicircle enlarged in the\r\ndirection of tangents at right angles with the diameter; a complete\r\ncircle could be inscribed in the space. It was probably never used for\r\na chorus, but was occupied by the seats of prominent spectators,\r\nparticularly the city officials and their friends. It was entered by\r\nmeans of the vaulted passages under the tribunals.\r\n\r\nThe steps leading from the orchestra upon the stage (Fig. 65) can be\r\nexplained only on the supposition that even in the Roman period, to\r\nwhich the steps in their present form belong, actors who took the\r\npart of persons arriving from distant places came upon the stage\r\nthrough the orchestra. In the niches in front of the stage, as we\r\nlearn from a wall painting, sat those charged with the maintenance of\r\norder in the Theatre, two perhaps in the rectangular niches, or one in\r\nthe semicircular niche in the middle.\r\n\r\nThe stage is long and narrow, measuring 120 by 24 Oscan feet; the\r\nfloor is a little more than three feet above the level of the\r\norchestra. The rear wall, as in ancient theatres generally, was built\r\nto represent the front of a palace, entered by three doors, and\r\nadorned with columns and niches for statues. In each of the short\r\nsections of wall at the ends of the stage is a broad doorway,\r\nextending across almost the entire space. The long narrow room behind\r\nthe stage, used as a dressing room (_postscaenium_), was entered by a\r\ndoor at the rear, which was reached by an inclined approach. No trace\r\nof the roof of the stage remains, but from the better preserved\r\ntheatres at Orange, in the south of France, and at Aspendus, in Asia\r\nMinor, we infer that it sloped back toward the rear wall. The floor\r\nwas of wood.\r\n\r\nThe room underneath the stage was divided into several parts. Between\r\nthe front wall and that just back of it (seen in Fig. 65) was the\r\nplace for the curtain, which, as in Roman theatres, was let down at\r\nthe beginning of the play, and raised at the end. The space between\r\nthe parallel walls must have been covered, leaving only a narrow slit\r\nfor the curtain; otherwise it would not have been easy to go upon the\r\nstage from the steps in the orchestra.\r\n\r\nUnderneath the place for the curtain is a low passage, in the vaulted\r\nroof of which are two rows of holes, a little more than a foot square,\r\ncut in blocks of basalt, and evidently designed to hold upright\r\ntimbers. This passage has in recent years been entirely cleared. In\r\nthe floor, directly under the openings in the vaulted roof and\r\ncorresponding with them, were square holes. In those nearer the front\r\nof the stage were remains of timbers and of square pieces of iron\r\nfitted to the ends of these, a larger and a smaller piece for each\r\nhole. It seems likely that, as Mazois suggested, hollow upright beams\r\nwere set in the holes, and in them smaller hollow beams were placed,\r\nin which were still smaller poles or iron rods; by the sliding of\r\nthese up and down, the long horizontal pole on which the curtain was\r\nhung could be raised or lowered. The use of the inner row of holes has\r\nnot been satisfactorily explained.\r\n\r\nThe room under the right of the stage is so low, about three feet,\r\nthat it could not have been available for any purpose, but that at the\r\nleft is higher, and was used for theatrical machinery, the scanty\r\nremains of which arouse our curiosity without satisfying it. In the\r\nfloor are set two oblong blocks of limestone, about four feet in\r\nlength. Each has in its upper surface a round hole, between two and\r\nthree inches deep, with an iron socket, in which there are still\r\nremains of an iron cap once fitted to the lower end of a vertical\r\nwooden shaft that turned in it; the upper end of the shaft--assuming\r\nthat the blocks are in their original position--must have revolved in\r\na socket fixed in one of the joists of the stage floor. There is\r\nbesides on the upper surface of each block a rectangular depression,\r\nand on either side a shallow incision; the purpose is altogether\r\nobscure. A third stone, similar to these two, is set in the north wall\r\nof the same room, and opposite it was fitted another; here, then, a\r\nhorizontal shaft turned; there was a similar pair of stones at the\r\nleft end of the place for the curtain. These arrangements suggest the\r\ncrane-like machine by which floating figures were brought upon the\r\nstage, as Medea in the play of Euripides riding in a chariot drawn by\r\ndragons, and the familiar _deus ex machina_; such machinery, according\r\nto Pollux (Onomast. IV. 128), was placed on the left side of the\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nWhen plays were presented, the front of the palace at the back of the\r\nstage was concealed by painted scenery. As several pieces might be\r\nproduced one after the other, it was necessary to arrange for the\r\nshifting of scenes. This was accomplished by drawing one set of\r\ndecorations off to the sides, thus bringing the next set into view\r\n(_scaena ductilis_); the ends were changed by turning the _periactoi_,\r\nhuge three-sided prisms, each side of which was suited to a different\r\nscene (_scaena versilis_). In spite of the clumsiness of the\r\narrangements, as contrasted with those of the best modern theatres,\r\nthe mounting of plays was artistic and impressive, and compares\r\nfavorably with that of Shakespeare's time.\r\n\r\nThe only allusions to matters connected with theatrical\r\nrepresentations at Pompeii are in inscriptions relating to actors, as\r\nSorex (p. 176). A number of graffiti scratched on walls in various\r\nparts of the city mention an Actius Anicetus, whose name is given in\r\nfull in an inscription found at Puteoli, C. Ummidius Actius Anicetus.\r\nHe seems to have been a very popular actor of pantomime, at the head\r\nof a troupe. One of the inscriptions reads: _Acti, a[mor] populi, cito\r\nredi_,--'Actius, darling of the people, come back quickly!'\r\n\r\nThe theatre in antiquity was by no means reserved for scenic\r\nrepresentations alone. It was a convenient place for bringing the\r\npeople together, and was used for public gatherings of the most varied\r\ncharacter. In the theatre at Tarentum the memorable assembly met which\r\nheaped insults upon the Roman ambassadors and precipitated war with\r\nRome. At Pergamos King Mithridates was to be crowned in the theatre by\r\na descending Victory, but by some mishap the wreath fell to the floor,\r\nan omen of evil. When the Ephesians, stirred up by Demetrius the\r\nsilversmith, wished to take measures against Paul and his companions,\r\n\"They rushed with one accord into the theatre.\" On such occasions we\r\nmay suppose that the front of the palace at the rear of the stage\r\nserved as a background without other decoration. This use of the\r\ntheatre for general purposes was a Greek rather than a Roman custom,\r\nbut the theatre itself in Italy was an importation from Greece; and we\r\nmay suppose that the theatre at Pompeii was on more than one occasion\r\nthe scene of notable demonstrations.\r\n\r\nOur Theatre, as is evident from the character of the construction, in\r\nits original form belonged to the Tufa Period, but was rebuilt in\r\nRoman times. Some particulars in regard to the rebuilding are given in\r\nan inscription: _M. M. Holconii Rufus et Celer cryptam, tribunalia,\r\ntheatrum_,--'Marcus Holconius Rufus and Marcus Holconius Celer (built)\r\nthe crypt, the tribunals, and the part designed for spectators,' that\r\nis, the vaulted corridor under the gallery, the platforms over the\r\nentrances to the orchestra, and the cavea.\r\n\r\nThe two Holconii lived in the time of Augustus. The elder, Rufus, was\r\nduumvir for the fourth term in 3-2 B.C. The work on the Theatre was\r\nprobably done about that time; for soon afterwards, before his fifth\r\nduumvirate, a statue in his honor was erected in the Theatre, as we\r\nlearn from an inscription. Later, in 13-14 A.D., the younger Holconius\r\nalso, when he had been chosen quinquennial duumvir, was honored with a\r\nstatue. The masonry of the corridor and of the exterior arches\r\nsupporting it, as well as of the tribunals, well agrees with that in\r\nvogue in the Augustan Age; we find brick-shaped blocks of tufa and\r\nreticulate work. The marble seats in the cavea may be assigned to the\r\nsame period; in the original structure the benches must have been of\r\ntufa. About the same time the present wall at the back of the stage\r\nwas built, in the place of an older and much simpler facade, but not\r\nby the Holconii; if this also had been rebuilt by them, it would have\r\nbeen mentioned in the inscription.\r\n\r\nPossibly the tribunals were an addition due to the Holconii. The\r\ncorridor under the gallery, however, must have been built in the place\r\nof an earlier corridor, for the piers on the outside rest on\r\nfoundations similar in character to the oldest parts of the building.\r\nAs these piers served no other purpose than to sustain the passage\r\nopening into the section of seats above the corridor, this must have\r\nformed a part of the original plan.\r\n\r\nThe statues of both the Holconii probably stood in niches in the wall\r\nat the back of the stage. Holconius Rufus was further honored with a\r\nmonument of some sort in the cavea. The lowest seat of the media cavea\r\nhad at the middle, directly opposite the stage, a double width for a\r\ndistance of about five feet, gained by removing a portion of the next\r\nseat above. Here was an inscription in bronze letters: _M. Holconio M.\r\nf. Rufo, II. v. i. d. quinquiens, iter[um] quinq[uennali], trib[uno]\r\nmil[itum] a p[opulo], flamini Aug[usti], patr[ono] colo[niae],\r\nd[ecurionum] d[ecreto]_,--'[Dedicated] in accordance with a decree of\r\nthe city council to Marcus Holconius Rufus the son of Marcus, five\r\ntimes duumvir with judiciary authority, twice quinquennial duumvir,\r\nmilitary tribune by the choice of the people, priest of Augustus, and\r\npatron of the colony.' The object placed here was of bronze, and was\r\nmade secure by fastenings set in twelve holes; what it was is\r\naltogether uncertain. The ancients had the custom of conferring\r\nlasting honor upon a deserving man after death by placing in the\r\ntheatre a seat inscribed with his name. We should be glad to believe\r\nthat a 'seat of double width,' _bisellium_, the use of which was\r\nallowed to members of the city council, was placed here, but the\r\narrangement of the twelve holes is difficult to reconcile with this\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nThe architect employed by the Holconii, a freedman, was not honored\r\nwith a statue, but his name was transmitted to posterity in an\r\ninscription placed in the outer wall near the east entrance to the\r\norchestra: _M. Artorius M. l[ibertus] Primus, architectus_,--'Marcus\r\nArtorius Primus, freedman of Marcus, architect.'\r\n\r\nThe plan of the Theatre could not have been taken from a Roman model;\r\nit conforms, as we should have expected, to the Greek type. In the\r\nRoman theatre the orchestra was in the form of a semicircle, of which\r\nthe diameter was represented by the stage. In Greek theatres, on the\r\ncontrary, the stage according to Vitruvius was laid out on one side of\r\na square inscribed in the circle of the orchestra; the orchestra, as\r\nshown by existing remains, in most cases was either a complete circle\r\nor was so extended by tangents at the sides that a circle could be\r\ninscribed in it. The latter is the case in our Theatre, of which the\r\norchestra has essentially the same form as that of the theatre of\r\nDionysus at Athens.\r\n\r\nThe stage falls under the limit of height,--five feet,--allowed by\r\nVitruvius for the stage of the Roman theatre, not to mention the\r\nheight of ten to twelve feet specified for that of the Greek type. The\r\nreason assigned for the moderate elevation of the Roman stage is that\r\nthe orchestra was occupied by the seats of senators, whose view would\r\nbe obstructed if more than a moderate elevation should be given to the\r\nfront of the stage. The orchestra of our Theatre was apparently from\r\nthe beginning intended for the use of spectators, not for a chorus.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions reached by Dr. William Doerpfeld in regard to the\r\nstage of the Greek theatre, if borne out by the facts, would\r\nnecessitate a complete abandonment of previous views on the subject.\r\nHis theory, in brief, is, that not only the chorus but also the actors\r\nwent through their parts not on the stage but in the orchestra, which\r\nhad the form of a circle, and that what we are accustomed to consider\r\nthe front wall of the stage was rather the rear wall of the platform\r\nin the orchestra on which the actors and chorus stood, this wall being\r\nlaid out on a tangent of the circle and having a height of twelve\r\nfeet, as we may understand from Vitruvius and from the remains of the\r\ntheatre at Epidaurus.\r\n\r\nThe main reasons advanced in support of this theory are that the\r\nplatform currently regarded as the stage, which according to Vitruvius\r\nand the existing remains was hardly more than ten feet wide, must have\r\nbeen too narrow to allow free movement on the part of the actors, and\r\nthat the height above the orchestra was too great to admit of the\r\nclose relation between the actors and the chorus, of which there is\r\nabundant evidence in the extant dramas. According to Dr. Doerpfeld,\r\nthe stage came into existence in Italy first, and in the Roman period,\r\nwhen there was no longer any chorus; a platform five feet high was\r\nbuilt for the actors, extending to the middle of the orchestra, so\r\nthat this now took the form of a semicircle and could be used for the\r\nseats of spectators.\r\n\r\nTo undertake the examination of Dr. Doerpfeld's theory in detail would\r\nnot be pertinent here; yet we cannot bring our description of the\r\nTheatre at Pompeii to a close without inquiring whether this\r\nstructure, which is perhaps a century older than the oldest Roman\r\ntheatre, shows any trace of the arrangement which the theory assumes.\r\nUnfortunately, the evidence is not conclusive for either a negative or\r\nan affirmative answer. Just as this second edition goes to press a\r\njoint investigation of the whole matter has been undertaken by the\r\nauthor and Dr. Doerpfeld, whose work is being facilitated by\r\nexcavations. It is yet too early to anticipate the conclusions to\r\nwhich the evidence thus gained will lead; we may hazard a tentative\r\nstatement in regard to only one or two points.\r\n\r\nIt now appears probable that the present stage was not constructed at\r\nthe same time with the other parts of the Theatre, but that it is a\r\nlater addition. There is no trace of an earlier stage, and there is\r\nnothing to indicate that this was built against the part of the\r\nstructure designed for the spectators. We might assume that this\r\nearlier stage was placed at a slight distance from the other parts of\r\nthe building, and that the entrances of the orchestra, the parodoi,\r\nlay between, were it not for the fact that the outer doorways of the\r\npresent parodoi--notably that on the west side with the head of a\r\nsatyr on the keystone--unquestionably belong to the original\r\nstructure; and we should not be warranted in assuming two entrances to\r\nthe orchestra on each side. At the same time it is evident that the\r\nconstruction of the tribunalia must have involved a rebuilding of this\r\npart of the Theatre, and it is possible that originally passages led\r\nfrom the outer doors of the present parodoi, not to the orchestra, but\r\nto the ranges of seats. In that case, assuming that the stage was\r\nslightly removed from the rest of the structure, we may freely grant\r\nthat the acting may have gone on in front of it rather than upon it,\r\nand that this may have been a Greek theatre according to Dr.\r\nDoerpfeld's view. But we are here dealing only with possibilities; it\r\nis to be hoped that further investigation will bring to light data for\r\na final solution of the problem.\r\n\r\nIn the open space between the Theatre, the Forum Triangulare, and the\r\nPalaestra there is a deep reservoir for water (D), square on the\r\noutside and round within. It was evidently used for the sprinklings,\r\n_sparsiones_, with saffron-colored water, by which on summer days the\r\nheat of the Theatre was mollified. That such sprinklings were in vogue\r\nin Pompeii is known from announcements of gladiatorial combats,\r\npainted on walls, in which they are advertised together with an awning\r\nas part of the attraction,--_sparsiones, vela erunt_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n_THE SMALL THEATRE_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe names of the builders of the Small Theatre are known from an\r\ninscription which is found in duplicate in different parts of the\r\nbuilding: _C. Quinctius C. f. Valg[us], M. Porcius M. f. duovir[i]\r\ndec[urionum] decr[eto] theatrum tectum fac[iundum] locar[unt]\r\neidemq[ue] prob[arunt]_,--'Gaius Quinctius Valgus the son of Gaius and\r\nMarcus Porcius the son of Marcus, duumvirs, in accordance with a\r\ndecree of the city council let the contract for building the covered\r\ntheatre, and approved the work.' Later the same officials, when, after\r\nthe customary interval, they had been elected quinquennial duumvirs,\r\nbuilt the Amphitheatre 'at their own expense' (p. 212).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 66.--Plan of the Small Theatre.\r\n\r\n     1. Dressing room.\r\n     2. Stage.\r\n     3, 3. Tribunals.]\r\n\r\nWhen two magistrates set up an inscription in duplicate, ordinarily\r\nthe name of one appears first in one copy, while that of the second is\r\nput first in the other. In all four inscriptions, however, two at the\r\nSmall Theatre and two at the Amphitheatre, Valgus has the first place.\r\nThe reason in the case of the Amphitheatre is not far to seek: Valgus\r\nwas the man of means, who furnished the money for the building, but\r\nallowed his colleague and friend to share in the honor. We may also\r\nbelieve that, while the Small Theatre was erected 'in accordance with\r\na decree of the city council,' and hence presumably at public expense,\r\na part of the funds was contributed by Valgus, who on this account\r\nreceived honor above his less opulent colleague.\r\n\r\nThe son-in-law of this Valgus, Publius Servilius Rullus, has been\r\nundeservedly immortalized by a speech of Cicero in opposition to a\r\nbill brought forward by him in regard to the division of the public\r\nlands. From the same oration we learn that Valgus, a man without\r\nscruples, had taken advantage of the reign of terror instituted by\r\nSulla to acquire vast wealth, particularly in the way of landed\r\nproperty. Among his estates was one in the country of the Hirpini,\r\nnear the city of Aeclanum (south of Beneventum), which made him its\r\npatron and for which, as shown by an inscription, he repaired the\r\nwalls destroyed in the Civil War. He was undoubtedly one of the\r\nleading men in the colony founded by Sulla at Pompeii, and very likely\r\nsought by large public benefactions to cast his former life into\r\noblivion. The Small Theatre must have been built in the early years of\r\nthe Roman colony, not long after 80 B.C.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 67.--View of the Small Theatre.]\r\n\r\nA covered auditorium in the immediate vicinity of a large unroofed\r\ntheatre was not uncommon. About the time of the destruction of Pompeii\r\nthe poet Statius, praising the magnificence of his native city Naples,\r\nspeaks of 'twin theatres in a single structure, one open and one\r\nroofed,'--_geminam molem nudi tectique theatri_. Our only clew to the\r\nspecial use of such a building, however, is derived from the one\r\nerected at Athens by Herodes Atticus, in the reign of Hadrian. This\r\nwas called an Odeum, that is, according to the derivation of the word,\r\na room for singing; musical entertainments were held there,\r\nespecially, we may assume, those musical contests which had so\r\nimportant a place in ancient festivals. The purpose of the roof was\r\ndoubtless to add to the acoustic effect.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the Large Theatre has been discussed at so great length\r\nthat a few words will suffice in relation to that of the smaller\r\nstructure (Fig. 66). That it might be possible to cover the enclosed\r\nspace with a roof, the upper rows of seats were reduced in length, and\r\nthe whole building--cavea, orchestra, and stage--was brought into an\r\noblong shape; only the orchestra and the lower rows of seats in the\r\ncavea form a complete semicircle. The pyramidal roof was supported by\r\na wall on all four sides; in the upper part of the wall, between the\r\nroof and the highest row of seats, there were probably windows.\r\n\r\nThe seating capacity of the building was about fifteen hundred. The\r\nlowest section of the cavea, as in the Large Theatre, consisted of\r\nfour low, broad ledges on which the chairs of the decurions could be\r\nplaced. Above these is a parapet, behind which is a passage accessible\r\nat either end by semicircular steps. The broad range of seats above\r\nwas divided into five wedge-shaped blocks by flights of steps; only\r\ntwo of these, however, extended as far as the passage running along\r\nthe upper side, which could be reached from the alley at the rear of\r\nthe building by means of stairways connecting with outside doors.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 68.--Section of a seat in the Small Theatre.]\r\n\r\nThe seats were of masonry capped with slabs of tufa about seven inches\r\nthick. They had depressions in the side and in the top, as may be seen\r\nin the accompanying section (Fig. 68). They were thus made somewhat\r\nmore comfortable, the person in front being less subject to\r\ndisturbance from the feet of one sitting on the next seat behind; a\r\nsaving of room was also effected--an important consideration in the\r\nconstruction of a small auditorium.\r\n\r\nThe tribunals (3, 3) differed from those in the Large Theatre in that\r\nthey were shut off entirely from the seats of the cavea by a sharply\r\ninclined wall, and were entered only from the stage, by means of\r\nnarrow stairways; in this way the exclusive character of the seats was\r\nmade still more prominent. Besides the platform itself, measuring only\r\nabout 11 by 9 feet, three seats above each tribunal were set off with\r\nit by the same division wall and were available for the occupants.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 69.--An Atlas.]\r\n\r\nThe sloping wall between the tribunal and the cavea on each side ends\r\nwith a kneeling Atlas (Fig. 69); large vases probably stood on the two\r\nbrackets supported by these figures. The end of the parapet on either\r\nside is embellished with a lion's foot of tufa (Fig. 70). These rather\r\ncoarse sculptures illustrate the character of the art that was brought\r\nto Pompeii by the Roman colony. The workmanship is by no means fine,\r\nyet the muscles of the figures are well rendered, and the effect is\r\npleasing.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 70.--Ornament at the ends of the parapet.]\r\n\r\nThe pavement of the orchestra (seen in Fig. 67) consists of small\r\nflags of colored marble. An inscription in bronze letters informs us\r\nthat it was laid by the duumvir Marcus Oculatius Verus _pro ludis_,\r\nthat is instead of the games which he would otherwise have been\r\nexpected to provide.\r\n\r\nAt the ends of the stage, as in the case of the Large Theatre, there\r\nwere two broad entrances. The wall at the rear, which was veneered\r\nwith marble, had the customary three doors, and in addition two small\r\ndoors, one near each end. The long dressing room behind the stage had\r\nlikewise two broad entrances at the ends, besides four at the rear.\r\nApparently the two narrow doors near the ends of the wall at the rear\r\nof the stage, and the two doors corresponding with them at the back of\r\nthe dressing room, were for the use of those who had seats on the\r\ntribunals; they could thus enter and leave their places even when the\r\nlarge side doors of both stage and dressing room had been shut--as\r\nundoubtedly happened immediately after the procession (_pompa_) had\r\npassed across the stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n_THE THEATRE COLONNADE, USED AS BARRACKS FOR GLADIATORS_\r\n\r\n\r\n'Behind the stage,' says Vitruvius (V. ix.), speaking of the\r\narrangements of the theatre, 'colonnades should be built, that shelter\r\nmay be afforded to spectators in case of rain and a place provided for\r\nmaking preparations for the stage.'\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 71.--Plan of the Theatre Colonnade, showing its\r\n   relation to the two theatres.\r\n\r\n     1.

Mess room.]\r\n\r\nThis maxim of ancient architects was applied at Pompeii in a generous\r\nway; in connection with the theatres there was an extensive system of\r\ncolonnades. To understand their use it will be necessary first to view\r\nthem as they were in the earlier time, and then to take account of\r\nlater changes.\r\n\r\nIn the Oscan Period, and afterwards to the end of the Republic, when\r\na performance in the Large Theatre was interrupted by a shower, the\r\nspectators in the upper seats could take refuge under the colonnade of\r\nthe Forum Triangulare; those below found shelter under the rectangular\r\ncolonnade at the rear, which was obviously built for the purpose, and\r\nmay be called, by way of distinction, the Theatre Colonnade (Fig. 71).\r\nIt contained seventy-four Doric columns, and enclosed a large open\r\narea. The main entrance (2) was near the northeast corner. The\r\nentrance hall on the side of the colonnade was supported by three\r\nIonic columns. It was connected at the north end with a short\r\ncolonnade on the east side of the area back of the stage of the\r\nTheatre; this led to the large door at the east end of the stage and\r\nthe corresponding parodos of the orchestra; the wall at 4 on our plan\r\nis a later addition. The Theatre Colonnade must have been used also as\r\na promenade on days when there was no performance; it was connected by\r\na broad passage (1) with Stabian Street.\r\n\r\nThis colonnade seems too far away to have served as a place for making\r\npreparations for the stage; another was erected for that purpose. At\r\nthe northwest corner a broad stairway leads down from the Forum\r\nTriangulare (5; cf. Fig. 65); from the foot a small and inconvenient\r\nflight of steps leads into the area at the rear of the stage. In a\r\nline with the stairway is a series of small rooms opening toward the\r\nsouth. These do not belong to the original structure. In their place\r\nthere was once a colonnade, which faced the north and connected the\r\nlarge stairway with the short colonnade, the remains of which are\r\nstill to be seen on the east side of the area; the back of it was at\r\nthe same time the back of the north division of the Theatre Colonnade.\r\nThere was thus a covered passage extending from the foot of the\r\nstairway along two sides of the area to the east entrance of the stage\r\nand of the orchestra, which would answer very well to the second part\r\nof Vitruvius's dictum; but it had also another important use.\r\n\r\nThe portico of the Forum Triangulare, as we have seen, was at the same\r\ntime the monumental entrance of the Theatre, and the large doorway at\r\nthe left was used only for the ceremonious admission of the city\r\nofficials, who with their retinue formed a procession in the Forum\r\nand wended their way hither in festal attire in order to open the\r\nperformance--a formality that may be compared with the parade with\r\nwhich the Roman games were opened at Rome.\r\n\r\nThe route of such a procession, after entering the Forum Triangulare,\r\nis now clear. It passed along under the colonnade adjoining the\r\nTheatre, beyond the entrances to the upper portion of the cavea;\r\nturned and descended the broad stairway (5), proceeded under the\r\ncolonnade along the south and east sides of the area behind the stage,\r\nand finally came upon the stage through the wide doorway at the east\r\nend. It was indeed possible to pass beyond the stage entrance and\r\nproceed through the parodos directly to the seats of the orchestra and\r\nthe lowest section of the cavea; but it is more in accordance with the\r\nfondness of the ancients for display to suppose that the procession\r\nmoved across the stage, receiving as it passed the plaudits of the\r\ngreat audience, and emerged from the entrance opposite that by which\r\nit came in, disbanding in the court, whence the members could go to\r\ntheir respective seats. We need not here raise the question whether\r\nthe procession passed upon the stage behind the triangular side\r\nscreens (_periactoi_), or whether these were set in place only after\r\nit had already passed.\r\n\r\nWhen the colonnade on the south side of the court had been replaced by\r\nrooms, and the Theatre Colonnade itself had been transformed into\r\nbarracks, this route of the processions was blocked. They could still\r\npass down the street in front of the temple of Isis, turn into Stabian\r\nStreet, and reach the stage through the passage at the rear of the\r\nSmall Theatre; but it does not seem probable that they followed this\r\ncourse, for the reason that there are three large stepping stones in\r\nthe street before one comes to the entrance of the passage; these\r\nwould have proved a serious obstruction, and would undoubtedly have\r\nbeen removed had the processions gone this way.\r\n\r\nWe may rather believe that before the usual route was closed the\r\nprocessions themselves had been given up. They were still in vogue,\r\nhowever, when the Small Theatre was built; otherwise the purpose of\r\nthe wide entrances at the ends of the stage and of the room back of it\r\nis not clear. Moreover the sidewalk in front of the Small Theatre, on\r\nStabian Street, is of an altogether unusual width, and was apparently\r\ncovered by a portico. We infer that the procession to this theatre\r\nentered at the west end of the stage, and passed out at the east end;\r\nsince it could not disperse on the street, it would turn where the\r\nsidewalk was broadest, go back through the room at the rear of the\r\nstage into the court, and there disband.\r\n\r\nThe discontinuance of the processions must then be assigned to the\r\nperiod between the building of the Small Theatre and the changing over\r\nof the Theatre Colonnade into barracks, which, to judge from the\r\nmasonry and the remains of the decoration, did not take place before\r\nthe time of Nero. The processions were abandoned either in the\r\ntroubled period of the Civil Wars, or in the early years of the\r\nEmpire; if in the latter period, their discontinuance may have been\r\ndue to legislation connected with the reorganization of the Empire\r\nunder Augustus, or to the overshadowing of them by more imposing\r\nceremonies introduced in connection with the religious festivals.\r\n\r\nOur information in regard to the later use of the Theatre Colonnade is\r\nindeed meagre; not a single inscription bearing upon it has been\r\nfound. Yet when we take into account the changes that were made in it,\r\nand the objects found there, the supposition that it was turned into\r\nbarracks for gladiators in the time of the Early Empire, and so used\r\ntill the destruction of the city, is seen to harmonize with almost all\r\nthe facts.\r\n\r\nFirst, rooms were built on all sides behind the colonnade; on the\r\nnorth side they took the place of the south arm of the colonnade in\r\nthe area back of the stage. They were in two series, one above the\r\nother; the upper rooms were entered from a low wooden gallery\r\naccessible by three stairways. They could not have been intended for\r\nshops; they were too small, measuring on the average hardly more than\r\ntwelve feet square, and the doors were too narrow. There were no doors\r\nopening from one room into the other. Both lower and upper rooms, we\r\nmay conclude, were used for men's quarters.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE IV.--THE BARRACKS OF THE GLADIATORS, LOOKING\r\n   SOUTH]\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the south side a large room was left, with the front\r\nopen toward the area, an exedra (6). On the east side was a still\r\nlarger room the front of which is divided off by pillars; other\r\nrooms open from it, and among them is one (10) with several hearths,\r\nevidently intended for a mess kitchen, if the hearths are ancient;\r\nthey may be modern. Over these rooms was a second story, reached by a\r\nbroad stairway (9).\r\n\r\nThe immediate connection of the colonnade with the area behind the\r\nstage was now cut off by a wall (4); there was left only a small door\r\nin the corner, which could be readily fastened. The entrance from the\r\npassage leading to Stabian Street (2) was provided with doors and\r\nplaced under the control of a guard, for whom a special room was built\r\nat one side (3). There was a third entrance, narrow and easily closed,\r\nat the northwest corner, where a flight of steps connected the foot of\r\nthe broad stairway (5) with the landing of the stairs leading to the\r\nwooden gallery.\r\n\r\nThus a complete transformation was effected. The promenade for\r\ntheatre-goers had become barracks, with a great number of cell-like\r\nrooms, a mess kitchen, and narrow, guarded entrances. Soldiers,\r\nhowever, could not have been kept here; in the period to which the\r\nrebuilding belongs, garrisons were not stationed in the cities of\r\nItaly except the Capital. On the other hand, gladiatorial combats in\r\nPompeii were so frequent, and on so large a scale, that a special\r\nbuilding for the housing and guarding of gladiators would seem to have\r\nbeen a necessity; such a building would naturally have been erected by\r\nthe city and placed at the disposal of those who gave the games. As\r\nearly as the time of Augustus, Aulus Clodius Flaccus brought forward\r\nforty pairs of gladiators in a single day, and on various occasions\r\nafterwards as many as thirty pairs were engaged. How well the\r\ncolonnade was now suited for gladiators' quarters may be seen from a\r\nglance at the plan. The area would serve as a practice court, the\r\nexedra on the south side (6), protected from the sun, as the station\r\nfor the trainers and lounging room for men awaiting their turn; the\r\nmess room would be the large apartment adjoining the kitchen (11),\r\nwhile the quarters of the chief trainer, _lanista_, and his\r\nassistants, would be in the second story, reached by the broad\r\nstairway (9).\r\n\r\nThe small rooms were poorly decorated, in the fourth style. There were\r\nbetter paintings only in the exedra. On the rear wall of this room\r\nwas the oft repeated group of Mars and Venus; on the side walls,\r\ngladiatorial weapons were represented, piled up in heaps, after the\r\nmanner of trophies, about eight feet high. The reference to the\r\npurpose of the building, as in the case of the paintings in the\r\nMacellum, is obvious. The columns about the area were originally\r\nwhite; after the rebuilding the unfluted lower part was painted red,\r\nthe upper part yellow. Four columns, however, two at the middle of the\r\neast side, and the two opposite them on the west side, were painted\r\nblue, probably to serve as bounds in marking off the area for athletic\r\nexercises.\r\n\r\nThe objects found in the barracks are recorded in the journal of the\r\nexcavations. They indicate that at the time of the eruption the rooms\r\nwere occupied. Everything of value was removed from those on the north\r\nside by the survivors, but the south half was apparently left\r\nundisturbed, and has yielded a rich harvest.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 72.--A gladiator's greave.]\r\n\r\nIn ten rooms the excavators found a great quantity of weapons of the\r\nkinds used by gladiators, including fifteen helmets, a shield, greaves\r\n(Fig. 72), several broad belts trimmed with metal, and a couple of\r\narmlets; there were more than a hundred scales of horn belonging to a\r\ncoat of mail, and a half dozen shoulder protectors, _galeri_, which\r\nthe net fighter, _retiarius_, who carried no shield and was armed only\r\nwith a net and a trident, wore on his left shoulder. The weapons were\r\nmostly for defence, but remains of a few offensive weapons were found,\r\nas the head of a lance, a sword, and a couple of daggers. In the same\r\nroom with the daggers and the sword (perhaps 7) were the remains of\r\ntwo wooden chests containing cloth with gold thread; this may have\r\nbeen used in gladiators' costumes.\r\n\r\nThe helmets are characteristic (Fig. 73). They are furnished with a\r\nvisor, and part of them have a broad rim, richly ornamented with\r\nreliefs; their shape corresponds exactly with that of the helmets\r\nseen in paintings and reliefs representing gladiatorial combats. The\r\nshield, which is round and only about sixteen inches in diameter,\r\nwould have been quite useless in military service. In a room under the\r\nstairs the skeleton of a horse was found, with remains of trappings\r\nrichly mounted with bronze; one class of gladiators, the equites,\r\nfought on horseback.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 73.--A gladiator's helmet.]\r\n\r\nOne of the small rooms on the west side (8) was used as a guard room.\r\nHere were the stocks, the remains of which are shown in Fig. 74; they\r\nwere fastened to a board. At one end of the under piece was a lock, by\r\nwhich the bar passed through the rings could be made secure. The men\r\nconfined had the choice of lying down or sitting in an uncomfortable\r\nposition. The four persons whose skeletons were found in this room,\r\nhowever, were not in the stocks at the time of the eruption. That such\r\nmeans of discipline should be employed in controlling gladiators is\r\nentirely consistent with ancient methods.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 74.--Remains of stocks found in the guard room of\r\n   the barracks.]\r\n\r\nBesides these finds, there were others not so easily explained. In the\r\ntwo rooms in which the spearhead and the other offensive weapons were\r\nfound, there were eighteen skeletons, among them that of a woman\r\nrichly adorned with gold jewelry; she had a necklace with emeralds,\r\nearrings, and two armbands, besides rings and other ornaments, and in\r\na casket a cameo, the elaborate setting of which is in part preserved.\r\nIn a room near the southwest corner the bones of a new-born infant\r\nwere found in an earthen jar. A number of weights also were\r\ndiscovered, and vessels of terra cotta and glass; in three rooms there\r\nwere more than six dozen small saucers. Were the barracks wholly given\r\nup to gladiators at the time of the eruption, or were some other\r\npersons allowed to have quarters here, perhaps some of those whose\r\nhouses had been destroyed by the earthquake of 63 and had not been\r\nrebuilt? A certain conclusion cannot be reached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n_THE PALAESTRA_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe oblong court north of the Large Theatre, between the entrance of\r\nthe Forum Triangulare and the temple of Isis, is the Palaestra.\r\nOriginally, the enclosed area was entirely surrounded by a colonnade,\r\nwith ten columns on the sides and five at each end; but at a\r\ncomparatively late period, probably after the earthquake of 63, the\r\ncolumns at the east end were removed and the space thus gained was\r\nadded to the temple of Isis.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 75.--Plan of the Palaestra.\r\n\r\n     1. Colonnade.\r\n     2. Pedestal.\r\n     3. Dressing rooms.]\r\n\r\nA number of the columns on the other three sides are still standing.\r\nThey are Doric but of slender proportions, the height, 101/2 feet, being\r\nequal to eight diameters, while the intercolumniations measure about\r\nnine feet. It is doubtful whether the columns carried a complete\r\nentablature; more likely the roof rested directly on a wooden\r\narchitrave.\r\n\r\nThe building clearly dates from the pre-Roman period. The columns are\r\nof tufa coated with stucco, the dimensions of the colonnade (90 by 36\r\nOscan feet) reduce to the early standard of measurement; and an Oscan\r\ninscription was found here which says that the building was erected by\r\nthe Quaestor Vibius Vinicius, with money which Vibius Adiranus had\r\nleft by will to the Pompeian youth. The translation of the word\r\n_vereiiai_, 'to the youth,' otherwise doubtful, is confirmed by\r\nvarious facts which indicate that the building was intended as a small\r\npalaestra or open-air gymnasium for boys.\r\n\r\nWhile the Palaestra had its original length, the entrance, which is\r\nnow nearer the east end, was at the middle of the north side. Opposite\r\nit, near the colonnade on the south side, is a pedestal of tufa,\r\nbefore which stands a small table of the same stone (Fig. 76). The\r\npedestal is reached by narrow steps. Here stood a statue of the patron\r\ndivinity of the Palaestra. When an athletic contest was held, the\r\nwreath intended for the victor was laid on the stone table before the\r\ngod; after the award had been made, the successful contestant took up\r\nthe wreath and dedicated it to the divinity by mounting the steps and\r\nplacing it on the head of the statue. It is evident from the height of\r\nthe steps that the contestants were boys, not men.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 76.--View of the Palaestra, with the pedestal,\r\n   table, and steps.]\r\n\r\nOn the pedestal was undoubtedly a statue of Hermes, but not of the\r\ntype which we have already met with in the court of the temple of\r\nApollo (p. 88), and shall find later in the palaestra of the Stabian\r\nBaths (p. 200); a base of this sort can hardly have been intended for\r\na herm. No trace of the missing statue has been discovered.\r\n\r\nAnother statue stood at the foot of one of the columns on the south\r\nside. It is a copy of the doryphorus of Polyclitus, and is now in the\r\nNaples Museum (Fig. 77). Though it has been restored, there seems no\r\ngood reason to believe that the restoration is incorrect, and that the\r\nfigure is really a Hermes, having originally carried on the left\r\nshoulder a herald's staff with entwined snakes, _caduceus_, instead of\r\na spear. For the adornment of a place devoted to athletic exercises\r\nnothing could have been more appropriate than a copy of the doryphorus\r\nas an ideal of youthful strength, of harmonious physical development;\r\nand the Elder Pliny bears witness (N. H. XXXIV. v. 18), that it was\r\ncustomary to set up such statues in a palaestra. This figure had no\r\npedestal; it stood on the ground, a man among men.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 77.--Doryphorus. Statue found in the Palaestra.]\r\n\r\nAt the west end of the court were dressing rooms where the boys,\r\nbefore exercising, could anoint themselves and afterwards could remove\r\nthe oil and dirt with the strigil; such a dressing room in connection\r\nwith a bath was called a destrictarium. Water was brought into the\r\ncourt by a lead pipe, which passed through one of the columns at the\r\nright of the entrance and threw a jet either into a basin standing\r\nbelow or into the gutter in front of the colonnade.\r\n\r\nIt would be of interest to know what athletic exercises were practised\r\nin the Palaestra; but apart from the pedestal with its steps and table\r\nno characteristic remains were found here. The exercises in the Roman\r\nperiod undoubtedly differed somewhat from those practised at the time\r\nwhen the building was erected, when the Greek system was everywhere in\r\nvogue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n_THE TEMPLE OF ISIS_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe loftiest and purest religious conceptions of the ancient Egyptians\r\nwere embodied in the myth of Isis and Osiris, which in the third\r\nmillennium B.C. had already become the basis of a firmly established\r\ncult. These conceptions approached the monotheistic idea of an\r\nomnipresent god, and with them was associated a belief in a blessed\r\nimmortality. Isis was the goddess of heaven, and Osiris was the\r\nSun-god, her brother and husband, who is slain at evening by his\r\nbrother Set,--the Greek Typhon,--ruler of darkness. Their child Horus,\r\nalso called Harpocrates, born after the father's death, is the fresh\r\nsun of the new day, the successor and avenger of his father, the\r\nconqueror of Set; he becomes a new Osiris, while the father, ever\r\nblessed, rules in the realm of the dead, the kingdom of the West. Man,\r\nthe followers of Isis taught, is an incarnation of deity, whose\r\ndestiny is also his. He is himself an Osiris, and will enter upon a\r\nbetter state of existence beyond the grave if a favorable judgment is\r\npassed upon him in the trial given to the dead.\r\n\r\nThe worship of Isis, associated with Mysteries from an early period,\r\nwas reorganized by the first Ptolemy with the help of Manetho, an\r\nEgyptian priest, and Timotheus, a Greek skilled in the Eleusinian\r\nMysteries. The purpose of the king was to unite his Egyptian and Greek\r\nsubjects in one faith, and the effort was more successful than might\r\nhave been anticipated. In its new Alexandrian form the worship of Isis\r\nand Osiris, or Serapis, as the latter divinity was now called, spread,\r\nnot only over all Egypt, but also over the other countries in the East\r\ninto which Greek culture had penetrated, and soon made its way to\r\nItaly and the West.\r\n\r\nVarious causes contributed to the rapid extension of the cult. It had\r\nthe charm of something foreign and full of mystery. Its doctrine,\r\nsupported by the prestige of immemorial antiquity, successfully\r\nopposed the mutually destructive opinions of the philosophers, while\r\nat the same time its conception of deity was by no means inconsistent\r\nwith philosophic thought; and it brought to the initiated that\r\nexpectation of a future life to which the Eleusinian Mysteries owed\r\ntheir attractive power. The ascetic side of the worship, too, with its\r\nfastings and abstinence from the pleasures of sense, that the soul\r\nmight lose itself in the mystical contemplation of deity, had a\r\nfascination for natures that were religiously susceptible; and the\r\ncelebration of the Mysteries, the representation of the myth of Isis\r\nin pantomime with a musical accompaniment, appealed powerfully to the\r\nimagination. The cult also possessed elements that brought it nearer\r\nto the needs of the multitude. The activities of the Egyptian\r\ndivinities were not confined to the other world; their help might be\r\nsought in the concerns of this life. Thus the chief priest could say\r\nto Apuleius that Isis summoned her elect to consecrate themselves to\r\nher service only when the term of life allotted to them had really\r\nexpired, and that she lengthened their tale of years, so that all of\r\nlife remaining was a direct gift from the hands of the goddess. The\r\npriests of Isis were looked upon as experts in astrology, the\r\ninterpretation of dreams, and the conjuring of spirits.\r\n\r\nA college of the Servants of Isis, Pastophori, was founded in Rome in\r\nthe time of Sulla, about 80 B.C. In vain the authorities tried to\r\ndrive out the worship of the Egyptian gods. Three times their temple,\r\nin the midst of the city, was destroyed by order of the consuls, in\r\n58, 50, and 48 B.C. But after Caesar's death, in 44 B.C., the\r\ntriumvirs built a temple in honor of Isis and Osiris; and a few\r\ndecades later, perhaps in the reign of Caligula, their festival was\r\nrecognized in the public Calendar. In Campania the Alexandrian cult\r\ngained a foothold earlier than in Rome. An inscription of the year 105\r\nB.C., found at Puteoli, proves that a temple of Serapis was then\r\nstanding in that enterprising city, which had close commercial\r\nrelations with Egypt and the East. Soon after this date the earlier\r\ntemple of Isis at Pompeii must have been built.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 78.--Plan of the temple of Isis.\r\n\r\n     1. Portico.\r\n     2. Cella.\r\n     3. Shrine of Harpocrates.\r\n     4. Purgatorium.\r\n     5. Hall of initiation.\r\n     6. Hall of the Mysteries.\r\n     7, 8, 9.

The temple evidently belonged to the\r\ncity; and the places for statues in the court, as the inscriptions\r\nshow, were assigned by vote of the city council.\r\n\r\nOther inscriptions give information in regard to the family of the\r\nchild Celsinus. His father was Numerius Popidius Ampliatus, his mother\r\nCorelia Celsa; a brother bore the same name as the father. The real\r\nrebuilders were of course the parents; by associating their\r\nmunificence with the name of their son, they opened the way for him to\r\nthe city offices, for which the father, a freedman, was not eligible.\r\nAmpliatus perpetuated his own name by setting up a statue of Bacchus\r\nin a niche in the outside of the rear wall of the temple (at _c_ on\r\nthe plan), with the inscription: _N. Popidius Ampliatus pater p. s._,\r\n'Numerius Popidius Ampliatus the father (set up this statue) at his\r\nown expense.' The names of the two sons appear with that of their\r\nmother in the mosaic floor of the large room (6) behind the colonnade\r\nat the rear.\r\n\r\nThough the rebuilding of Celsinus was 'from the foundation,' remains\r\nof the old temple were utilized, as shafts of columns and Corinthian\r\ncapitals coated with white stucco; and the plan of the new building\r\nwas very nearly the same as that of the old. The stylobate of the\r\ncolonnade belongs to the earlier structure, but the columns originally\r\nstood nearer together, eight instead of seven at the ends, and ten on\r\nthe sides.\r\n\r\nThe architectural forms and the workmanship of these remains point to\r\na time just after the founding of the Roman colony; nevertheless the\r\ndimensions of the colonnade, approximately fifty by sixty Oscan feet,\r\nreduce to the pre-Roman standard of measurement, and the building may\r\nhave been commenced earlier. In later times the increasing number of\r\nthe worshippers of Isis made necessary an enlargement of the\r\nsanctuary. The two rooms at the west end (5 and 6) were added at the\r\nexpense of the Palaestra, probably at the time of the rebuilding.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the court, which is surrounded by the colonnade, is\r\nthe temple, consisting of an oblong cella (2), the east side of which\r\nis treated as a front, with a portico borne by six columns (1). A pit\r\nfor the refuse of sacrifices, enclosed by a wall (_b_) stands in the\r\ncorner of the court near the entrance from the street; in the opposite\r\ncorner there is a larger enclosure having the appearance of a small\r\ntemple (4). Near this are two altars; a third altar stood close to the\r\ntemple, and there are five others, somewhat smaller, between the\r\ncolumns. On the south side, between the colonnade and the Theatre, is\r\na small area of irregular shape, east of which is a dwelling\r\ncontaining five rooms (7, 8, 9).\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustrations show the temple as it is to-day (Fig.\r\n79) and as it was before the eruption (Fig. 80). It has\r\narchitecturally nothing suggestive of the Egyptian style. Yet the plan\r\npresents a marked deviation from ordinary types, as if the builders,\r\nerecting an edifice for the worship of foreign gods, strove with set\r\npurpose to produce a bizarre effect; at the right and the left of the\r\nfront of the cella is a large niche, projecting beyond the sides of\r\nthe portico, and inorganically connected with the main part of the\r\ntemple by a pilaster. In the ornamentation of this temple, as in that\r\nof the temple of Apollo, the simple and chaste forms of the Greek\r\narchitecture were replaced by gaudy stucco ornaments more in harmony\r\nwith the prevailing taste.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 79.--View of the temple of Isis.]\r\n\r\nBesides the broad flight of steps in front, a narrow stairway at the\r\nleft of the temple led to a side door opening into the cella. A base\r\nof masonry about six feet high extends across the rear of the cella,\r\non which were two pedestals of tufa, about sixteen inches square, for\r\nthe statues of Isis and Osiris. In the two large niches outside other\r\ndivinities stood, perhaps Anubis and Harpocrates. The latter was\r\napparently worshipped also at the shrine in the wall on the east side\r\nof the court (3), facing the doorway of the cella. A painting from\r\nthis shrine, now in the Naples Museum, represents a statue of\r\nHarpocrates of the familiar type--a boy with his finger in his mouth\r\nholding a cornucopia, with a lotus blossom resting on his forehead;\r\nbefore him stands a priest in a long white robe, holding a candlestick\r\nin each hand, while in the background is a temple surrounded by a\r\ncolonnade, evidently intended for a free representation of the temple\r\nbefore us. In front of the shrine were the charred remains of a wooden\r\nbench.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 80.--The temple of Isis, restored. In the\r\n   background, the Large Theatre.]\r\n\r\nNo statue was found in the cella or in the two niches in front. We may\r\nsuppose that the images of the four divinities, being of relatively\r\nsmall size, were carried off by the priests at the time of the\r\neruption; had they been removed afterwards, the excavators would have\r\ntaken also the other objects in the cella used in the services of the\r\ntemple. Among these were two skulls, probably made use of in the\r\nceremonies attending initiation into the Mysteries, and a marble hand,\r\nabout four inches long, but whether a right or a left hand, the\r\njournal of the excavations does not say. A left hand was carried in\r\nthe procession in honor of Isis, described by Apuleius; as the weaker\r\nof the two, and so less ready to do evil, it symbolized the even\r\njustice (_aequitas_) with which the deity governs the world. There\r\nwere also two wooden caskets, one of which contained a diminutive gold\r\ncup, measuring less than an inch across the top, a glass vessel a\r\ntrifle over an inch and a half in height, and a statuette of a god\r\nabout half as high; in the other were two bronze candlesticks about\r\nten inches high, the use of which may be inferred from the painting\r\ndescribed above, and a bronze lamp with places for two wicks.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the colonnade were painted in bright colors on a deep red\r\nground. The lower part of the columns was red, but above they were\r\nwhite; the temple also was white, the purpose obviously being to give\r\nthe appearance of marble. Nevertheless the same decorative framework\r\nappears both in the white stucco of the temple and the painted\r\ndecoration of the colonnade: a division of the body of the wall into\r\nlarge panels, with a continuous garland of conventional plant forms\r\nabove. In the colonnade there was a yellow base, treated as a\r\nprojecting architectural member; above it large red panels alternated\r\nwith light, fantastic architectural designs in yellow on a red ground.\r\nThe frieze was black, with garlands in strong contrast--green, blue,\r\nand yellow--enlivened with all sorts of animal forms. In the middle of\r\neach of the large panels was a priest of Isis; in the lower part of\r\nthe intervening architectural designs were marine pictures,--galleys\r\nmaneuvering, and seafights. Similar pictures are found in other\r\nbuildings, as the Macellum, but marine views were especially\r\nappropriate here, because Isis was a patron divinity of seamen.\r\nApuleius gives an interesting description of the spring festival, by\r\nwhich the navigation of the opening season was committed to her\r\nguardian care.\r\n\r\nOpposite the entrance of the temple the colonnade presents an\r\ninteresting peculiarity of construction, which is found also in other\r\nbuildings at Pompeii, as the Stabian Baths. The place of the three\r\nmiddle columns on that side is taken by two large pillars, higher than\r\nthe rest of the colonnade, each of which is backed by an attached\r\nhalf-column. This arrangement made the approach to the temple more\r\nimposing, and also furnished an appropriate setting for the shrine of\r\nHarpocrates against the wall.\r\n\r\nThe principal altar, on which sacrifice was offered to the divinities\r\nworshipped in the temple, is that near the foot of the steps in front\r\n(_e_). The officiating priest stood on a block of stone at the side of\r\nit, with the temple at his right; on this altar were found ashes and\r\nfragments of calcined bones. The two smaller altars near by were\r\nprobably consecrated to the gods whose images were placed in the\r\nexterior niches.\r\n\r\nTwo rectangular pits were used as receptacles for the refuse of\r\nsacrifices. One was quite small, and no trace of it can now be found;\r\nit was near the large altar, and contained remains of burnt figs, pine\r\nkernels and cones, nuts, and dates, with fragments of two statuettes\r\nrepresenting divinities. The wall about the other (_b_), when\r\nexcavated, was built up at each end in the form of a gable, and\r\nevidently once supported a wooden roof; in this pit also were charred\r\nremains of fruits. What divinities were worshipped at the altars\r\nbetween the columns, it is impossible to determine. The small base\r\nstanding against the corner column near the entrance (seen in Fig. 79)\r\nwas probably a pedestal, not an altar.\r\n\r\nAt the left of the steps leading up to the temple, and facing the\r\nlarge altar, is a small pillar of masonry fifteen inches square and\r\nnearly two and a half feet high. A similar pillar, which formerly\r\nstood at the right, had thin slabs of stone on three sides. One of\r\nthese, that on the front of the pillar (now in the Naples Museum), was\r\ncovered with hieroglyphics. It is a memorial tablet, which Hat, 'the\r\nwriter of the divine word,' _hierogrammateus_, set up in honor of his\r\nparents and grandparents; it contains symbolic representations in\r\nthree divisions, one above the other. In the upper division Hat, his\r\nbrother and colleague Meran, their father and grandfather, are praying\r\nto Osiris, 'Lord of the Kingdom of the Dead'; below, Hat is bringing\r\nto his parents and grandparents offerings for the dead, while in the\r\nlower division Meran and two sisters unite with him in prayer to\r\nOsiris. The tablet could hardly have been designed for a temple, but\r\nstill, by reason of its contents, it was considered appropriate for\r\nthis place. It was doubtless intended that a similar tablet should be\r\naffixed to the pillar at the left, but perhaps none happened to be\r\navailable; statuettes of divinities were probably placed on the\r\npillars.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a statue of Bacchus in the niche in the rear wall of\r\nthe cella is easily explained; this divinity was identified with\r\nOsiris. Two ears are moulded in the stucco beside the niche, symbolic\r\nof the listening of the god to the prayers of his worshippers.\r\n\r\nAgainst the west wall of the colonnade, near the corners, were two\r\npedestals, with statues of female divinities about one half life size.\r\nAt the right was Isis, in archaic Greek costume, with the inscription:\r\n_L. Caecilius Phoebus posuit l[oco] d[ato] d[ecurionum] d[ecreto]_,\r\n'Set up by Lucius Caecilius Phoebus, in a place granted by a decree of\r\nthe city council'; the name indicates that the donor was a freedman.\r\nThe other statue, at the left, represents Venus drying her hair after\r\nthe bath; it is of a common type and possesses small value as a work\r\nof art, yet is of interest because of the well preserved painting and\r\ngilding. Venus, as many other goddesses, was identified with Isis.\r\n\r\nIn the same corner with the statue of Venus, against the south wall,\r\nstood the herm of Gaius Norbanus Sorex, a marble pillar with a bronze\r\nhead. According to the inscription, he was an actor who played the\r\nsecond part (_secundarum, sc. partium_), and was also magister of the\r\nsuburb Pagus Augustus Felix. He was probably a generous supporter of\r\nthe temple. A duplicate of the herm is found in the Eumachia building,\r\nto which also he may have made a contribution. The low social standing\r\nof the various benefactors of the temple is noteworthy; it indicates\r\nin what circles the worship of the Egyptian divinities found its\r\nadherents. As yet this was by no means an aristocratic cult, although\r\nit became such later, especially after the time of Hadrian.\r\n\r\nWhile the Greek and Roman gods were honored chiefly at their\r\nfestivals, the Egyptian divinities demanded worship every day, indeed\r\nseveral times a day. The early service, the 'opening of the temple,'\r\nis described by Apuleius, who was probably admitted to the college of\r\nthe Servants of Isis in Rome in the time of the Antonines, and wrote\r\nabout 160 A.D. Before daybreak the priest went into the temple by the\r\nside entrance and threw back the great doors, which were fastened on\r\nthe inside. White linen curtains were hung across the doorway,\r\nshielding the interior from view. Now the street gate of the court was\r\nopened; the thronging multitude of the devout streamed in and took\r\ntheir places in front of the temple. The curtains were drawn aside and\r\nthe image of the goddess was presented to the gaze of her worshippers,\r\nwho greeted her with prayers and shaking of the sistrum, a musical\r\nrattle, the use of which was characteristic of the worship of the\r\nEgyptian gods. For a time they remained sitting, engaged in prayer and\r\nin the contemplation of the divinity; an hour after daybreak the\r\nservice was closed with an invocation to the newly risen sun. This\r\ndescription throws light on the purpose of the bench in front of the\r\nshrine of Harpocrates.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 81.--Scene from the worship of Isis--the adoration\r\n   of the holy water. Wall painting from Herculaneum.]\r\n\r\nThe second service was held at two o'clock in the afternoon, but we do\r\nnot possess exact information in regard to it. It is, perhaps,\r\ndepicted in a fresco painting from Herculaneum (Fig. 81), the subject\r\nof which is a solemn act in the worship of Isis, the adoration of the\r\nholy water. In the portico of the temple, above the steps, two priests\r\nand a priestess are standing. The priest in the middle holds in front\r\nof him, in the folds of his robe, a vessel containing the holy water,\r\nwhich was supposed to be from the Nile; his two associates are shaking\r\nthe sistrum. There is an altar at the foot of the steps; a priest is\r\nfanning the fire into flame. On the right and the left of the altar\r\nare the worshippers, with other priests, part of whom are shaking the\r\nsistrum, while a fluteplayer sits in the foreground at the right.\r\n\r\nAnother painting, the counterpart of that just described, seems to\r\nportray the celebration of a festival; the surroundings correspond\r\nfairly well with those of our temple. The doors are thrown back; a\r\ndark-visaged man, wearing a wreath, is dancing in the doorway. Behind\r\nhim, within the temple, are the musicians, among whom can be\r\ndistinguished a girl striking the cymbals and a woman with a\r\ntambourine. About the steps are priests and other worshippers, shaking\r\nthe sistrum and offering prayer; in front stands a burning altar. An\r\nimportant festival of Isis occurred in November. It commenced with an\r\nimpassioned lamentation over the death of Osiris and the search for\r\nhis body. On the third day, November 12, the finding of the body by\r\nIsis was celebrated with great rejoicing. So, perhaps, in this\r\npainting the dance is a manifestation of the joy with which the\r\nfestival ended, the whole picture being a scene from the observance of\r\nthe Egyptian Easter.\r\n\r\nIn such celebrations use would be made of the small brazier of bronze\r\nfound in the court in front of our temple, on which incense could be\r\nburned. The ablutions, which played so important a part in Egyptian\r\nrites, were performed in the rear of the court, where stood a\r\ncylindrical leaden vessel, adorned with Egyptian figures in relief; a\r\njet fell into it from a lead pipe connected with the city aqueduct.\r\n\r\nThe small building at the southeast corner of the court, which is\r\nknown as the Purgatorium, was open to the sky. It was made to look\r\nlike a roofed structure by the addition of gables at the ends. On the\r\ninside, at the rear, a flight of steps leads down toward the right to\r\na vaulted underground chamber, about five feet wide and six and a half\r\nfeet long. The inner part of the chamber, divided off by a low wall,\r\nwas evidently intended for a tank. In one of the corners in the front\r\npart is a low base, on which a jar could be set while it was being\r\nfilled. Here the holy Nile water--more or less genuine--was kept for\r\nuse in the sacred rites.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the tank is suggested by certain of the stucco reliefs\r\non the outside of the enclosing wall. In the gable, above the\r\nentrance, is a vase, standing out from a blue ground, with a kneeling\r\nfigure on either side. The frieze contains Egyptian priests and\r\npriestesses, also on a blue ground, with their faces turned toward the\r\nvessel (Fig. 82). The figures are all worshipping the sacred water in\r\nthe vase.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 82.--Part of the facade of the Purgatorium.]\r\n\r\nOf the other figures in relief, only the two goddesses in the panels\r\nat the sides of the entrance have an Egyptian character. Under each of\r\nthem was a small altar of tufa, attached to the wall; the figure at\r\nthe left (Fig. 82) is plainly Isis.\r\n\r\nThe side walls are decorated with reliefs in Greco-Roman style. They\r\nare divided into a large middle panel, containing two figures, and two\r\nside panels, each with a Cupid. In the middle panel, on the right\r\nside, Mars and Venus are represented; in that at the left, Perseus\r\nrescuing Andromeda (Fig. 83).\r\n\r\nThe dwelling back of the colonnade, on the south side, consists of a\r\nkitchen (8), a dining room (7), a sleeping apartment (9), and two\r\nsmall rooms at the rear, under the stairway leading to the highest\r\nseats of the Large Theatre. The ritual of the Egyptian gods was so\r\nexacting, and the services of worship were so numerous, that it was\r\nnecessary for one or more priests to reside within the precincts of\r\nthe temple. These rooms were the habitation of a priest.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 83.--Decoration of the east side of the\r\n   Purgatorium--Perseus rescuing Andromeda.\r\n\r\n   At the right and the left floating Cupids, the one at the left\r\n   bearing a box of incense.]\r\n\r\nOne of the rooms on the west side (6) is oblong in shape, with five\r\nbroad, arched entrances opening from the colonnade. The walls were\r\nrichly decorated in the last Pompeian style. There were seven large\r\npaintings, five of which were landscapes with shrines, part being\r\nEgyptian landscapes; the other two represent Io watched by Argus, with\r\nHermes coming to rescue her, and Io in Egypt, received by Isis.\r\nAgainst the rear wall was a pedestal, on which probably stood the\r\nfemale figure, above life size, the remains of which were found in one\r\nof the entrances. Only the head, the hands, and the front parts of the\r\nfeet were of marble; the rest was of wood, no doubt concealed by\r\ndrapery. The priests seemingly had started to carry the statue with\r\nthem when they fled, but abandoned the attempt at the doorway. In the\r\nsame room a marble table, a sistrum, two pots of terra cotta, three\r\nsmall glass bottles, and a glass cup were found. We may safely\r\nconclude that here the common meals were served, of which, as we\r\nlearn from Apuleius, the devotees of the cult partook. And when, in\r\nconnection with the great festivals, the Mysteries were celebrated\r\nwith a presentation of the myth of Isis and Osiris in pantomime, this\r\nlarge room was well adapted for the sacred exhibitions.\r\n\r\nThe adjoining room, at the southwest corner of the colonnade (5), is\r\nirregular in shape and of an entirely different character. It seems to\r\nhave been regarded as a sacred place, and to have been used for secret\r\nceremonies. It was entered from the colonnade by a narrow door, which\r\ncould be securely fastened. Large, sketchy pictures of gods were\r\npainted on the walls on a white ground,--Isis, Osiris, Typhon,--with\r\nsacred animals and symbols relating to the myth which to us are\r\nunintelligible. The excavators found here the remains of four wooden\r\nstatues with marble heads, hands, and feet, one of a male figure, the\r\nother three female; there were besides a statuette of an Egyptian god\r\nmade of green stone, on which were hieroglyphics; a statuette of white\r\nclay, covered with a green glaze; a sphinx of terra cotta, fragments\r\nof terra cotta statuettes of Egyptian figures, different kinds of\r\nvessels of clay, glass, and lead, and a bronze knife, evidently\r\nintended for use in sacrifices. At the left near the entrance is a\r\nsmall reservoir, reached by three steps. On the north side is a niche\r\nthat apparently formed part of a small shrine.\r\n\r\nA kind of alcove opens off from the southeast corner of this room, the\r\nentrance to which could be closed by a curtain. From this a few steps\r\nand a door led into a storeroom, in which were found about three dozen\r\nvessels of various shapes, an iron tripod, and no less than\r\nfifty-eight earthen lamps. The lamps were in part provided with iron\r\nrings, so that they could be suspended; there were also iron rods,\r\nwhich the excavators supposed to be lamp holders. A rear door\r\nconnected the storeroom with the small area of irregular shape between\r\nthe Palaestra and the Theatre.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements suggest the celebration of secret rites by night;\r\nwe may well believe that novices were here initiated into the order of\r\nthe Servants of Isis. Obscure hints in regard to the ceremonies\r\nconnected with the consecration to the service of the goddess are\r\nthrown out by Apuleius. 'The initiation,' said the priest to him, 'is\r\nconducted under the image of a voluntary death, with the renewing of\r\nlife as a gift from the deity.' Of his own experience he says merely:\r\n'I came to the borders of death, I trod the threshold of Proserpina,\r\nthen came back through all the stages to life. In the middle of the\r\nnight I saw the sun shine brightly; I entered into the immediate\r\npresence of the gods above and the gods below, and worshipped them\r\nface to face.'\r\n\r\nRenunciation of past life, and a second birth to a new and purified\r\nexistence, were the main ideas underlying the ceremonies, which as\r\npresented here must have been far less splendid and impressive than in\r\nRome, where they were witnessed by Apuleius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n_THE TEMPLE OF ZEUS MILICHIUS_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe small temple near the northeast corner of the block containing the\r\ntheatres is entered from Stabian Street. The court (Fig. 84, 2), like\r\nthat of the temple of Vespasian, has a colonnade across the front;\r\nonly the foundation and a Doric capital of lava are preserved.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 84.--Plan of the temple of Zeus Milichius.\r\n\r\n     1. Colonnade.\r\n     2. Court, with large altar.\r\n     3. Cella.\r\n     4. Sacristan's room.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the colonnade on the right is the room of the sacristan\r\n(4). The large altar (Fig. 251) stands close to the foot of the steps\r\nleading up to the temple. It is built of blocks of tufa, with a frieze\r\nof triglyphs and panels like those found on walls in the first style\r\nof decoration.\r\n\r\nThe steps extend across the front of the temple, the unusual elevation\r\nof which is explained by the inequality of the ground. Of the six\r\ncolumns in the tetrastyle portico no remains have been found, but\r\nthree capitals of pilasters are preserved, two belonging to those at\r\nthe corners of the cella, and one, considerably smaller, to a\r\ndoorpost; they are of tufa, and were once covered with white stucco.\r\n\r\nThe excellent proportions and fine workmanship of the capitals point\r\nto the period of the first style of decoration; there was formerly a\r\nremnant of that style on the north wall of the cella, copied before\r\n1837. Nevertheless the quasi-reticulate masonry of the cella, closely\r\nresembling that of the Small Theatre, dates from the early years of\r\nthe Roman colony. In this period the temple in its present form was\r\nbuilt, perhaps with the help of native Pompeian masons.\r\n\r\nAttached to the rear wall of the cella was an oblong pedestal on which\r\nwere placed two statues, representing Jupiter and Juno, together with\r\na bust of Minerva, all of terra cotta and of poor workmanship. The\r\nsuggestion at once presents itself that this was the Capitolium,\r\nerected by the Roman colonists soon after they settled in Pompeii. It\r\nis incredible, however, that colonists who had the means to erect\r\nmonumental buildings, such as the Amphitheatre and the Small Theatre,\r\nshould have housed the great gods of the Capitol in so modest a\r\ntemple, in so inconspicuous a spot, and should not have provided more\r\ncostly images.\r\n\r\nAll the evidence is in favor of the explanation, already proposed (p.\r\n66), that after the earthquake the worship of the gods of the Capitol\r\nwas transferred hither temporarily from the temple in the Forum, until\r\nthat should be rebuilt.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 85.--Capital of pilaster with the face of Zeus\r\n   Milichius.]\r\n\r\nWhat divinity thus became the host of the Roman gods? It would be\r\nimpossible to say but for the fortunate recovery of an Oscan\r\ninscription, which was set up in the passage of the Stabian Gate. This\r\ncommemorates the work of two aediles, M. Sittius and N. Pontius, who\r\nimproved the street leading out from the Stabian Gate 'as far as the\r\nStabian Bridge, and the Via Pompeiana as far as the temple of Zeus\r\nMilichius; these streets, as well as the Via Jovia (and another, the\r\nname of which cannot be made out) they placed in perfect repair.'\r\n\r\nIt is natural to suppose that the Via Pompeiana, mentioned in\r\nimmediate connection with the road leading to Stabiae, was the\r\ncontinuation of the latter within the city, or Stabian Street. This,\r\nthen, led to the temple named in the inscription, and as there is no\r\nother temple on the street, the small sanctuary in which the images of\r\nthe Capitoline divinities were placed was the temple of Zeus\r\nMilichius.\r\n\r\nThis building, however, is not old enough to have been mentioned in an\r\nOscan inscription. It probably stands in the place of a much earlier\r\nedifice. The masonry of the wall on the south side of the court is\r\ndifferent from that of the other walls, and older; as it shows no\r\ntrace of a cross wall, it must always have stood at the side of an\r\nopen space, such as that of the present court. To the earlier building\r\nthe capitals belong, the style of which, as remarked above, is\r\npre-Roman.\r\n\r\nIn view of this explanation, we should probably recognize in the head\r\ncarved on the smallest of the pilaster capitals (Fig. 85) a\r\nrepresentation of Zeus Milichius, a divinity honored in many parts of\r\nGreece, especially by the farmers; Zeus the Gracious, the patron of\r\ntillers of the soil. The serious, kindly face, bearded and with long\r\nlocks, was more than a mere ornament; it was the god himself looking\r\ndown upon the worshipper who entered his sanctuary. As a\r\nrepresentation of Zeus it probably exemplifies an ancient type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n_THE BATHS AT POMPEII.--THE STABIAN BATHS_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn comparison with the great bathing establishments of Rome, the baths\r\nat Pompeii are of moderate size. They have, however, a special\r\ninterest, due in part to their excellent preservation, in part to the\r\ncertainty with which the purpose of the various rooms can be\r\ndetermined; and their remains enable us to trace the development of\r\nthe public bath in a single city during a period of almost two hundred\r\nyears. From this source, moreover, most of our knowledge of the\r\narrangements of the ancient bath is derived, without which the\r\nimposing but barren remains of Rome itself would be for the most part\r\nunintelligible. It is not easy for one living under present conditions\r\nto understand how important a place the baths occupied in the life of\r\nantiquity, particularly of the Romans under the Empire; they offered,\r\nwithin a single enclosure, opportunities for physical care and comfort\r\nand leisurely intercourse with others, not unlike those afforded in\r\nthe cities of modern Europe by the club, the cafe, and the promenade.\r\n\r\nThough the Roman baths differed greatly in size and in details of\r\narrangement, the essential parts were everywhere the same. First there\r\nwas a court, _palaestra_, surrounded by a colonnade. This was devoted\r\nto gymnastic exercises, and connected with it in most cases was an\r\nopen-air swimming tank. The dressing room, _apodyterium_, was usually\r\nentered from the court through a passageway or anteroom. A basin for\r\ncold baths was sometimes placed in the dressing room; in large\r\nestablishments a separate apartment was set aside for this purpose,\r\nthe _frigidarium_. To avoid too sudden a change of temperature for the\r\nbathers, a room moderately heated, _tepidarium_, was placed between\r\nthe dressing room and the _caldarium_, in which hot baths were given.\r\nAt one end of the caldarium was a bath basin of masonry, _alveus_; at\r\nthe other was ordinarily a semicircular niche, _schola_, in which\r\nstood the _labrum_, a large, shallow, circular vessel resting upon a\r\nsupport of masonry, and supplied with lukewarm water by a pipe leading\r\nfrom a tank back of the furnace. The more extensive establishments, as\r\nthe Central Baths at Pompeii, contained also a round room, called\r\n_Laconicum_ from its Spartan origin, for sweating baths in dry air. In\r\ndescribing baths it is more convenient to use the ancient names.\r\n\r\nIn earlier times the rooms were heated by means of braziers, and in\r\none of the Pompeian baths the tepidarium was warmed in this way to the\r\nlast. A more satisfactory method was devised near the beginning of the\r\nfirst century B.C. by Sergius Orata, a famous epicure, whose surname\r\nis said to have been given to him because of his fondness for golden\r\ntrout (_auratae_). He was the first to plant artificial oyster beds in\r\nthe Lucrine Lake, and the experiment was so successful that he derived\r\na large income from them; we may assume that he turned an honest penny\r\nalso by his invention of the 'hanging baths,' _balneae pensiles_, with\r\nwhich his name has ever since been associated. These were built with a\r\nhollow space under the floor, the space being secured by making the\r\nfloor of tiles, two feet square, supported at the corners by small\r\nbrick pillars (Fig. 88); into this space hot air was introduced from\r\nthe furnace, and as the floor became warm, the temperature of the room\r\nabove was evenly modified.\r\n\r\nThis improved method of heating was not long restricted to the floors.\r\nAs early as the Republican period, the hollow space was extended to\r\nthe walls by means of small quadrangular flues and by the use of\r\nnipple tiles, _tegulae mammatae_, large rectangular tiles with conical\r\nprojections, about two inches high, at each corner; these were laid on\r\ntheir edges, with the projections pressed against the wall, thus\r\nleaving an air space on the inside.\r\n\r\nIn bathing establishments designed for both men and women, the two\r\ncaldariums were placed near together. There was a single furnace,\r\n_hypocausis_, where the water for the baths was warmed; from this also\r\nhot air was conveyed through broad flues under the floors of both\r\ncaldariums, thence circulating through the walls. Through similar\r\nflues underneath, the warm air, already considerably cooled, was\r\nconveyed from the hollow spaces of the caldariums into those of the\r\ntepidariums. In order to maintain a draft strong enough to draw the\r\nhot air from the furnace under the floors, the air spaces of the walls\r\nhad vents above, remains of which may still be seen in some baths.\r\nThese vents were no doubt sufficient to keep up the draft after the\r\nrooms had once been heated; but in order to warm them at the outset a\r\ndraft fire was needed,--that is, a small fire under the floor at some\r\npoint a considerable distance from the furnace and near the vents,\r\nthrough which it would cause the escape of warm air, and so start a\r\nhot current from the furnace. The place of the draft fire has been\r\nfound under two rooms of the Pompeian baths; and a similar arrangement\r\nhas been noted in the case of Roman baths excavated in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe use of the baths varied according to individual taste and medical\r\nadvice. In general, however, bathers availed themselves of one of\r\nthree methods.\r\n\r\nThe most common form of the bath was that taken after exercise in the\r\npalaestra,--ball playing was a favorite means of exercise,--use being\r\nmade of all the rooms. The bather undressed in the apodyterium, or\r\nperhaps in the tepidarium, where he was rubbed with unguents; then he\r\ntook a sweat in the caldarium, following it with a warm bath.\r\nReturning to the apodyterium, he gave himself a cold bath either in\r\nthis room or in the frigidarium; he then passed into the Laconicum,\r\nor, if there was no Laconicum, went back into the caldarium for a\r\nsecond sweat; lastly, before going out, he was thoroughly rubbed with\r\nunguents, as a safeguard against taking cold.\r\n\r\nSome bathers omitted the warm bath. They passed through the tepidarium\r\ndirectly into the Laconicum or caldarium, where they had a sweat; they\r\nthen took a cold bath, or had cold water poured over them, and were\r\nrubbed with unguents.\r\n\r\nIn the simplest form of the bath the main rooms were not used at all.\r\nThe bathers heated themselves with exercise in the palaestra, then\r\nremoved the dirt and oil with scrapers, _strigiles_, and bathed in the\r\nswimming tank.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE V.--APODYTERIUM OF THE STABIAN BATHS, WITH THE\r\n   ANTEROOM LEADING FROM THE PALAESTRA]\r\n\r\nUp to the present time three public baths have been excavated in\r\nPompeii, two for both men and women, one for men only. Besides these\r\nthere are two private establishments in the eighth Region (VIII. ii.\r\n17 and 23), one perhaps for men, the other for women; and another,\r\napparently for men, was discovered in the eighteenth century near the\r\nAmphitheatre and covered up again, being a part of the villa of Julia\r\nFelix. It is quite possible that two or three more bathing\r\nestablishments yet await excavation; one at least, connected with a\r\nwarm spring, is known to us from an inscription--that of M. Crassus\r\nFrugi. About a dozen houses also contain complete baths for private\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe largest and oldest bathing establishment at Pompeii is that to\r\nwhich the name Stabian Baths has been given, from its location on\r\nStabian Street. It was built in the second century B.C., but was\r\nremodelled in the early days of the Roman colony, and afterwards\r\nunderwent extensive repairs. It is of irregular shape, and occupies a\r\nlarge part of a block, having streets on three sides; on the north\r\nside it is bounded by the house of Siricus. Opening upon two of the\r\nstreets are shops, which have nothing to do with the baths and are not\r\nnumbered on the plan (Fig. 86).\r\n\r\nEntering from the south through the broad doorway at A, we find\r\nourselves in the palaestra, C, which has a colonnade on three sides.\r\nOn the west side the place of the colonnade is taken by a strip of\r\nsmooth pavement with a raised margin; two heavy stone balls were found\r\nhere, which were obviously used in a game resembling the modern\r\nninepins; at the further end is the room for the players, K. Close to\r\nthe bowling course, at the middle of the west side, is the swimming\r\ntank, F, with rooms (E, G) adjoining it at either end. At the corner\r\nnear the further room, G, is a side entrance, L; J is the office of\r\nthe director or superintendent in charge of the building.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of the court are the men's baths, rooms I-VIII; north\r\nof these are the women's baths, rooms 1-6, with the furnace room, IX,\r\nbetween them. In the northwest corner of the building were small rooms\r\n(_e-e_) intended for private baths. They had not been provided with\r\nthe improved heating arrangements, and were not in use at the time of\r\nthe catastrophe. The larger room adjoining (_k_) was a closet.\r\n\r\nThe anteroom of the men's baths (IV), opens at one end into the\r\ndressing room or apodyterium (VI), as seen in Plate V. It has a\r\nvaulted ceiling, richly decorated. A door at the left leads into the\r\nfrigidarium (V), and another at the right into a servants' waiting\r\nroom (I), which is accessible from the court. This room was formerly\r\nentered also from the street, through a passage (III), which was later\r\nclosed; on one side of it is a bench of masonry for the slaves in\r\nattendance upon their masters. Similar benches are found in the\r\nwaiting room at the other end of the apodyterium (X).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 86.--Plan of the Stabian Baths.\r\n\r\n     A. Main Entrance.\r\n     B.

Caldarium.]\r\n\r\nThe apodyterium also was provided with benches of the same sort, as\r\nindicated on the plan; they are shown in Plate V. Along the walls at\r\nthe sides, just under the edge of the vaulted ceiling, was a row of\r\nsmall niches, the use of which corresponded with that of the lockers\r\nin a modern gymnasium. These niches are about 5-3/4 feet above the floor,\r\nwhile those in the other dressing room (2) are a little less than five\r\nfeet; from this difference in height it has been rightly inferred that\r\nthe smaller and simpler division of the baths was set aside for women.\r\nThe floor is paved with rectangular flags of gray marble, with blocks\r\nof basalt next to the walls. While the walls were left simply white,\r\nwith a red base, the ceiling was elaborately decorated with stucco\r\nreliefs in the style prevalent shortly before the destruction of the\r\ncity; there are vestiges of similar decoration in the tepidarium. In\r\noctagonal, hexagonal, and quadrangular panels are rosettes, Cupids,\r\ntrophies, and bacchic figures. The lunettes are adorned with fantastic\r\narchitectural designs, in which we see bacchic figures standing on\r\npedestals, and Cupids riding on dolphins; the sides of the two arches\r\nsupporting the ceiling (one of them is seen in Plate V) are decorated\r\nwith female figures mounted on dolphins, which run out into\r\narabesques. The frequent suggestion of water in these motives is in\r\nharmony with the purpose of the room.\r\n\r\nEven more effective is the decoration of the small round frigidarium.\r\nLight is admitted, as in the Pantheon at Rome, through a round hole in\r\nthe apex of the domed ceiling. At the edge of the circular bath basin,\r\nlined with white marble, was a narrow strip of marble floor, which is\r\nextended into the four semicircular niches. Wall and niches alike are\r\npainted to represent a beautiful garden, with a blue sky above (Fig.\r\n87). The eye wanders among trees and shrubs, catching glimpses of\r\nbirds overhead, of statues and vases here and there in the midst of\r\nthe green foliage, and of jets of water falling into circular basins.\r\nThe blue dome is studded with stars. The bather could scarcely feel\r\nthe narrowness of a room, the decoration of which was so suggestive of\r\nexpanse and open air. A jet of water fell into the basin from a small\r\nniche in the upper part of the wall; and the place of the overflow\r\npipe may be easily recognized.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 87.--Stabian Baths: interior of the frigidarium,\r\n   restored.]\r\n\r\nThe tepidarium (VII) and caldarium (VIII) were heated by means of\r\nhollow floors and walls. The former is much the smaller, as we should\r\nhave expected from its use as an intermediate room, in which the\r\nbathers would ordinarily not tarry so long as in the caldarium. The\r\nlarge bath basin at the east end (indicated on the plan) is unusual;\r\nit was seemingly a later addition, and was probably made to\r\naccommodate those who in the winter shrank from using the frigidarium,\r\nbut wished nevertheless to take a moderately cold bath. Near the\r\nbottom of the wall back of this basin, a hole had been made so that\r\nunderneath a fire could be kindled from the outside (in X), not in\r\norder to heat the basin, which could be supplied with warm water by\r\nmeans of a pipe, but to start the circulation of hot air from the\r\nfurnace; at the top of the wall above were two vents opening from the\r\nwarm air chamber. There was a place for another draft fire under the\r\nwomen's caldarium.\r\n\r\nOne of the fragments of stucco relief still remaining in the\r\ntepidarium presents the figure of a man reading from a roll of\r\nmanuscript. It suggests the standing complaint of the ancients in\r\nregard to the trials of bathers, who could not escape the ever-present\r\npoet declaiming his latest production.\r\n\r\nAt one end of the caldarium we find the bath basin, alveus; at the\r\nother is the support of the labrum, which has disappeared. In the\r\nniche above the latter are two vents for the draft, and above the\r\nniche was a round window. This room, as most of the others, was dimly\r\nlighted. The little round window of the anteroom is shown in our\r\nplate. There were two similar windows in the lunette of the\r\napodyterium, above the roof of the anteroom; they are not seen in our\r\nplate, having at one time been entirely covered up by the construction\r\nof a wall to support the roof. A similar window was very likely placed\r\nat the end of the tepidarium, over the roof of the frigidarium; and\r\nperhaps these were supplemented by holes in the crown of the arched\r\nceilings, as in the women's apodyterium.\r\n\r\nThe women's baths are entered from the court through a long anteroom\r\n(6); the dressing room is connected also with the two side streets by\r\nmeans of corridors (1, 5). Originally there was no communication\r\nbetween the women's baths and the palaestra.\r\n\r\nThe apodyterium (2) is the best preserved room of the entire building,\r\nand also the most ancient. It shows almost no traces of the\r\ncatastrophe. The vaulted ceiling is intact. The smooth, white stucco\r\non the walls and the simple cornice at the base of the lunettes date\r\nfrom the time of the first builders. Now, as then, light is admitted\r\nonly through two small openings in the crown of the vault and a window\r\nin the west lunette. To a modern visitor the interior seems gloomy.\r\nThe pavement, of lozenge-shaped, reddish glazed tiles, belongs to the\r\nsame early period. There is a strip of basaltic flags connecting the\r\ndoor of one of the corridors (1) with that of the tepidarium. This\r\nmuch travelled path seems to indicate that many ladies--particularly,\r\nwe may assume, in the winter--went at once into the more comfortable\r\ntepidarium without stopping in the dressing room. Along the walls were\r\nbenches, and above them niches, as in the men's apodyterium. In the\r\ntime of the Empire the fronts of the niches, finely carved in tufa,\r\nwere overlaid with a thick coating of stucco, the upper part being\r\nornamented with designs in relief.\r\n\r\nThe women had no frigidarium. A large basin for cold baths was built\r\nat the west end of the dressing room, but this also is a later\r\naddition; before it was made, those who wished for cold baths must\r\nhave contented themselves with portable bath tubs.\r\n\r\nThe tepidarium (3) and caldarium (4) are in a better state of\r\npreservation than those of the men's baths, which they so closely\r\nresemble in all their arrangements that a detailed description is\r\nunnecessary. In their present form they are not so ancient as the\r\napodyterium, and the decoration is less elaborate than that of the\r\ncorresponding rooms on the other side.\r\n\r\nThe labrum is intact, a round, shallow basin of white marble resting\r\non a support of masonry; it has here no separate niche. The bath basin\r\nin the caldarium also retains its veneering of white marble, with an\r\noverflow pipe of bronze at the upper edge; it is about two feet deep.\r\nIn such basins the bathers leaned against the sloping back, which for\r\nthis reason was called a cushion (_pulvinus_) by Vitruvius. This\r\nalveus would accommodate eight bathers, that in the men's caldarium\r\nperhaps ten. Places were probably assigned in numerical order, each\r\nbather awaiting his turn. Those who did not wish to wait, or preferred\r\nto bathe by themselves, might use individual bath tubs of bronze.\r\nRemains of such a tub, as well as of bronze benches, were found in\r\nthis room. Near the bottom of the alveus in front is an opening,\r\nthrough which the water could be let out; when it was emptied, the\r\nwater ran over the white mosaic floor, which was thus cleaned.\r\n\r\nIn the time of the Early Empire it became the fashion to bathe with\r\nvery warm water. 'People want to be parboiled,' Seneca exclaims. The\r\nconstruction of the alveus, however, was not well adapted to conserve\r\nthe heat, and an ingenious contrivance was devised to remedy the\r\ndifficulty, which may best be explained with the help of our\r\nillustration, showing the arrangement of the bath basin in room 4\r\n(Fig. 88). A large hot air flue, D, led directly from the furnace to\r\nthe hollow space, C, under the alveus, A. Above this flue was a long\r\nbronze heater, B, in the form of a half cylinder, with one end opening\r\ninto the end of the alveus. As the bottom of the heater was six inches\r\nlower than that of the alveus, the cooler water from the basin would\r\nflow down into it and be heated again, a circulation being thus\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 88.--The bath basin in the women's\r\n   caldarium--longitudinal and transverse sections, showing the\r\n   arrangement for heating the water.\r\n\r\n     A. Bath basin, alveus.\r\n     B. Bronze heater.\r\n     C. Hot air chamber under the floor.\r\n     D. Hot air flue.]\r\n\r\nA similar arrangement (called _testudo alvei_ by Vitruvius) probably\r\nexisted for the alveus in the caldarium on the other side; but that\r\npart of the men's baths has been destroyed. Only one other heater of\r\nthis kind has been found,--and that much smaller,--in a villa near\r\nBoscoreale, recently excavated; but the semicircular opening made for\r\nthe heater above the hot air flue may be seen in the Central Baths, in\r\na private establishment at Pompeii, and generally in the remains of\r\nRoman baths.\r\n\r\nIn the furnace room (_praefurnium_, IX) between the two caldariums,\r\nstood three large cylindrical tanks. They have disappeared, but their\r\noutlines can still be seen in the masonry of the foundations, and are\r\nshown in our plan. The one furthest east was for hot water. It was\r\ndirectly over the fire, and connected with the bath basins of the two\r\ncaldariums. The next, for lukewarm water, stood over a hollow space\r\nopening into the furnace. A lead pipe leading from it to the labrum of\r\nthe women's caldarium is still to be seen; the water bubbled up in the\r\nmiddle of the labrum. The third and largest reservoir, for cold water,\r\nwas placed on a foundation of solid masonry.\r\n\r\nThe more important alterations made in the baths during the two\r\ncenturies that they were in use had to do with the arrangements for\r\nheating, and may briefly be considered here before we proceed to\r\nanother part of the building. It will be best not to weary the reader\r\nwith details, but to present a brief summary of conclusions, which\r\nwill perhaps be found of interest, not only as casting light on the\r\ngradual development of these baths, but also as illustrating that\r\nadjustment of public buildings to the needs and tastes of successive\r\ngenerations, which was as characteristic of ancient as it is of modern\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nFor the extensive changes made in the earlier part of the first\r\ncentury B.C. we have the evidence of an inscription, which had been\r\ncast aside and was found in one of the smaller rooms. It reads, _C.\r\nUulius C. f., P. Aninius C. f., II v. i. d., Laconicum et destrictarium\r\nfaciund. et porticus et palaestr[am] reficiunda locarunt ex\r\nd[ecurionum] d[ecreto] ex ea pequnia quod eos e lege in ludos aut in\r\nmonumento consumere oportuit faciun[da] coerarunt eidemque\r\nprobaru[nt]_. The form of the letters and the spelling point to the\r\ntime of Sulla as the period in which the inscription was cut. The\r\nsyntax is confused, but the meaning is clear: a Laconicum and\r\n_destrictarium_ were built, the colonnade and palaestra repaired, by\r\nthe duumvirs Gaius Ulius and Publius Aninius, in accordance with a\r\nvote of the city council; and they furnished the means for this work\r\nin fulfilment of their obligation, incurred by the acceptance of the\r\nduumviral office, to spend a certain sum upon either games or\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\nThe destrictarium--a room for removing dirt and oil with the strigil\r\nafter gymnastic exercises--is easily identified (D), as are also the\r\npalaestra and colonnade; but in our survey of the baths, we have\r\nfound no separate chamber to which the term Laconicum could properly\r\nbe applied. In order to arrive at a solution of the difficulty, we\r\nmust note the successive steps by which, as shown by an examination of\r\nthe remains of the masonry, the heating arrangements were extended and\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nAt first, in the Baths as originally constructed, there were neither\r\nhollow walls nor hollow floors. The heating was done by means of\r\nbraziers; and there were niches or lockers in the walls of the\r\ncaldariums and tepidariums similar to those now found in the dressing\r\nrooms, but in double rows, the upper niches being larger, the lower\r\nsmaller.\r\n\r\nLater, a hollow floor was built in the men's caldarium. Later still,\r\nthis room was provided with hollow walls, which were extended to the\r\ncrown of the ceilings and the lunettes, the tepidarium being still\r\nheated with braziers.\r\n\r\nFinally, a hollow floor and hollow walls were constructed at the same\r\ntime in the men's tepidarium, but the hot air chamber was not carried\r\nup into the ceiling or the lunettes.\r\n\r\nA similar transformation was gradually accomplished in the women's\r\napartments; but owing, it would seem, to a desire for greater warmth\r\nin the tepidarium, the hot air chamber here, as in the caldarium, was\r\nextended to the lunettes and the ceiling.\r\n\r\nSince the method of heating by means of hollow floors only came into\r\nvogue about 100 B.C., and since the duumvirate of Ulius and Aninius must\r\nhave occurred soon after 80 B.C., we are probably safe in supposing that\r\nthey built the hollow floors of the two caldariums, and that the new\r\nheating arrangement was loosely called a Laconicum. At least a partial\r\nwarrant for this interpretation is found in a passage of Dion Cassius\r\n(LIII. xxvii. 1), in which he says that Agrippa built the 'Spartan\r\nsweating bath,' [Greek: to pyriaterion to Lakonikon]. Agrippa, however,\r\nbuilt, not a Laconicum in the narrow sense, but a complete bathing\r\nestablishment, and Dion, doubtless following some earlier writer, uses\r\nthe word as generally applicable to a system of warm baths. In default\r\nof a better explanation, we must accept a meaning equally loose for our\r\ninscription.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to date, even approximately, the other changes by\r\nwhich the baths were conformed to the increasing desire for warmth and\r\ncomfort; but the decoration of the greater part of the building, with\r\nits complicated designs and stucco reliefs, was clearly applied to the\r\nwalls not many decades before the destruction of the city.\r\n\r\nThe unroofed swimming tank, F, was separated from the court by a\r\nbarrier of masonry about two feet high, which was extended also in\r\nfront of the rooms at the ends, E and G. On either side was a step,\r\nboth the steps and the barrier being veneered with white marble. The\r\ntank was supplied by a pipe entering from the northeast; the overflow\r\npipe, at the southeast corner, is indicated on the plan.\r\n\r\nThe rooms E and G, opening both on the swimming tank and on the court\r\nwith high arched doorways, were roofed shallow basins where the\r\nathletes could give themselves a preliminary cleaning before going\r\ninto the tank. The walls are veneered with marble to a height of 61/2\r\nfeet; above are painted plants, birds, statues, and nymphs, one of\r\nwhom holds a shell to catch a jet of water; over these the blue sky.\r\nHere, as in the frigidarium, the artist strove to convey the\r\nimpression of being in the open air, in a beautiful garden, adorned\r\nwith sculptures. A jet of water spurted from the rear wall just above\r\nthe marble dado; above it is a large oblong niche, apparently for a\r\nstatue.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the basin in G was filled up, and covered with a mosaic\r\nfloor of the same height as the threshold; when one cleaning room was\r\nfound to be adequate, that was retained which had a separate dressing\r\nroom, D. On the white walls of the dressing room are traces of the\r\nwooden wardrobes that once stood against them. In this room, the\r\ndestrictarium, the athletes disrobed, and rubbed themselves with oil\r\nbefore engaging in gymnastic exercises, and to it they returned from\r\nthe palaestra, in order to scrape themselves (_se destringere_); then\r\nthey washed themselves in the next room, E, and finally plunged into\r\nthe tank.\r\n\r\nThe room of the official in charge of the baths, J, had windows\r\nopening on the court and into the bowlers' room, K. A large bronze\r\nbrazier was found here, presented, according to an inscription on it,\r\nby Marcus Nigidius Vaccula, who, as a symbol of his name, had the\r\nfigure of a cow (_vacca_) stamped in relief on the brazier. We find a\r\nsimilar brazier, together with benches, in the tepidarium of the baths\r\nnear the Forum, which had no other means of heating; we naturally\r\ninfer that the furniture here was intended for one of the tepidariums,\r\nand used there before the improved method of heating was introduced. A\r\nNasennius Nigidius Vaccula, who died before 54 A.D., is known to us\r\nfrom the receipts of Caecilius Jucundus. If he was the donor, and made\r\nthe gift when he was a young man, the change of the system of heating\r\nin the tepidarium may have been made as early as 20 A.D.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 89.--Colonnade of the Stabian Baths: capital with\r\n   section of entablature, restored.]\r\n\r\nThe colonnade was originally uniform on all the three sides. The Doric\r\ncolumns were of tufa, coated with fine white stucco. They were of\r\nslender proportions, the height being a trifle over nine feet, with a\r\ndiameter of only sixteen inches. They were edged, not fluted, and\r\ndoubtless carried an entablature with triglyphs, of which no trace\r\nremains. In the time of the Empire, apparently before the earthquake\r\nof 63, the colonnade was remodelled in accordance with the prevailing\r\ntaste. The columns received a thick coating of stucco, with flutings\r\nindicated by incised lines; the lower third of the shaft was painted\r\nred, the upper portion being left white. Over the capitals, moulded in\r\nstucco, was an entablature resting on thick planks, and ornamented\r\nwith light-colored stucco reliefs. The general effect may be seen from\r\nour illustration (Fig. 89).\r\n\r\nIn this reconstruction the sameness of the earlier colonnade was\r\nvaried with pleasing irregularities. Thus in front of the main\r\nentrance (A), and in a corresponding position on the opposite side of\r\nthe court, the place of four columns was taken by two broad pillars\r\nflanked by half-columns, and carrying a roof more than five feet\r\nhigher than that of the rest of the colonnade. A similar arrangement\r\nhas already been noted in the colonnade of the temple of Isis (p.\r\n174).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 90.--Stabian Baths: southwest corner of the\r\n   palaestra, showing part of the colonnade and wall decorated with\r\n   stucco reliefs.]\r\n\r\nThe wall decoration of the court has been particularly well preserved\r\non the outer wall of D and E (Fig. 90; cf. Pl. XIII). The surface is\r\ndiversified by fantastic architectural designs in two stories, made up\r\nof slender columns with their entablatures, open doorways with steps\r\nleading up to them, and glimpses of interiors. In the panels thus\r\noutlined, figures of all kinds stand out in white relief on a bright\r\nred or blue ground. Above the arched doorway Jupiter sits, resting his\r\nright hand on his sceptre; near by, on a pillar, is the eagle. Further\r\nto the left a satyr offers Hercules a drinking horn. Another relief,\r\nnot so well preserved, has a motive suggestive of the purpose of the\r\nbuilding--Hylas at the spring seized by the nymphs. With this we may\r\nassociate two designs having reference to the exercises of the\r\npalaestra: a boxer, at the left of the doorway of E, and at the right\r\na man scraping himself with a strigil. On the outer wall of G is\r\nDaedalus, making wings for himself and Icarus.\r\n\r\nUnder the colonnade at the rear, a herm stands close to the wall,\r\nhaving the features of a youth with a garment drawn over his head and\r\ncovering the upper part of the body. For the explanation of it we are\r\nindebted to Pausanias. 'In the gymnasium at Phigalia, in Arcadia,'\r\nsays this writer, 'is an image of Hermes. It has the appearance of a\r\nman wrapped in a cloak, and terminates below in a square pillar in the\r\nplace of feet.' This is Hermes, the god of the Palaestra, here, as in\r\nPhigalia, in a guise suggestive of his function of Psychopompus, the\r\nconductor of departed souls. We have already met with an example of\r\nthe same type in the court of the temple of Apollo.\r\n\r\nA sundial stood on the roof of the frigidarium and men's caldarium,\r\nsupported by a foundation of masonry still visible. It bore an Oscan\r\ninscription, from which we learn that it was set up by the Quaestor\r\nMaras Atinius, in accordance with a decree of the council, the money\r\nfor the expenditure being derived from fines. The fines were very\r\nlikely collected here, by the official in charge of the building.\r\nSundials were erected also in the other baths at Pompeii. They were a\r\nnecessity, for all such establishments were conducted on a schedule of\r\nhours. Hadrian ordered that the baths in Rome should be open from the\r\neighth hour, that is, after two o'clock in the afternoon; and a\r\nregulation in regard to the time of opening, if not of closing, was\r\nprobably in force at Pompeii.\r\n\r\nA motley and tumultuous life once filled the barren court, the rooms\r\nnow ruined and deserted. The scene is well pictured by Seneca (Ep.\r\n56): 'Quiet is by no means so necessary for study as men commonly\r\nbelieve,' the philosopher gravely argues. 'I am living near a bath:\r\nsounds are heard on all sides. Just imagine for yourself every\r\nconceivable kind of noise that can offend the ear. The men of more\r\nsturdy muscle go through their exercises, and swing their hands\r\nheavily weighted with lead: I hear their groans when they strain\r\nthemselves, or the whistling of labored breath when they breathe out\r\nafter having held in. If one is rather lazy, and merely has himself\r\nrubbed with unguents, I hear the blows of the hand slapping his\r\nshoulders, the sound varying according as the massagist strikes with\r\nflat or hollow palm. If a ballplayer begins to play and to count his\r\nthrows, it's all up for the time being. Meanwhile there is a sudden\r\nbrawl, or a thief is caught, or there is some one in the bath who\r\nloves to hear the sound of his own voice; and the bathers plunge into\r\nthe swimming tank with loud splashing. These noises, however, are not\r\nwithout some semblance of excuse; but the hair plucker from time to\r\ntime raises his thin, shrill voice in order to attract attention, and\r\nis only still himself when he is forcing cries of pain from some one\r\nelse, from whose armpits he plucks the hairs. And above the din you\r\nhear the shouts of those who are selling cakes, sausages, and\r\nsweetmeats, besides all the hawkers of stuff from the cookshops, each\r\nwith a different and characteristic cry.'\r\n\r\nSuch were the distractions of a Roman bath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n_THE BATHS NEAR THE FORUM_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bathing establishment in the block north of the Forum is smaller\r\nand simpler in its arrangements than that described in the last\r\nchapter, but the parts are essentially the same. Here also we find a\r\ncourt, with a colonnade on three sides; a system of baths for men,\r\ncomprising a dressing room (I) with a small round frigidarium (II)\r\nopening off from it, a tepidarium (III), and a caldarium (IV); a\r\nsimilar system for women, the place of the frigidarium being taken by\r\na tank for cold baths (2) in the dressing room; and a long narrow\r\nfurnace room between the two baths (V). On three sides of the\r\nestablishment are shops, in connection with which are several inns.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 91.--Plan of the baths near the Forum.\r\n\r\n     A, A'.

Tepidarium.\r\n        4. Caldarium.\r\n        _d._ Sundial.]\r\n\r\nThese baths were built shortly after 80 B.C., about the time that\r\nUlius and Aninius repaired the Stabian Baths; the characteristic\r\nmasonry, with quasi-reticulate facing, is similar to that of the Small\r\nTheatre and the Amphitheatre. The names of the builders are known from\r\nan inscription found in duplicate: _L. Caesius C. f. d[uum] v[ir]\r\ni[uri] d[icundo], C. Occius M. f., L. Niraemius A. f. II v[iri] d[e]\r\nd[ecurionum] s[ententia] ex peq[unia] publ[ica] fac[iundum] curar[unt]\r\nprob[arunt] q[ue]_. Thus we see that the contract for the building was\r\nlet and the work approved by Lucius Caesius, duumvir with judiciary\r\nauthority,--his colleague had probably died since election and the\r\nvacancy had not yet been filled,--and the two aediles, Occius and\r\nNiraemius, who are here styled 'duumvirs,' for reasons already\r\nexplained (p. 12); the cost was defrayed by an appropriation from the\r\npublic treasury. Though these Baths are of later construction than the\r\nStabian Baths, they seem more ancient because fewer changes were made\r\nin them.\r\n\r\nThe court here was not a palaestra; it was small for gymnastic\r\nexercises, and was not provided with a swimming tank and dressing\r\nrooms. The open space was occupied by a garden.\r\n\r\nThe colonnade on the north and west sides of the court had slender\r\ncolumns standing far apart, with a low and simple entablature; on the\r\neast side the columns were replaced by pillars carrying low arches,\r\nwhich served as a support for a gallery affording a pleasant view of\r\nthe garden. This gallery was accessible from the upper rooms of\r\nseveral inns along the street leading north from the Forum, whose\r\nguests no doubt found diversion in watching what was going on\r\nbelow--an advantage that may have been taken into account by the city\r\nofficials in fixing the rent. There are benches on the north side of\r\nthe court, and at the middle a deep recess, or exedra (_b_), making a\r\npleasant retreat for quiet conversation. The entrance from the\r\nfrequented street at the left (A) is so arranged that passers-by could\r\nnot look in; near the entrance from the street on the opposite side\r\n(A') is a closet (_c_). The decoration of the court was extremely\r\nsimple. Columns and walls were unpainted; on the lower parts, stucco\r\nwith bits of brick in it; above, white plaster.\r\n\r\nFrom the court a corridor (_a_) led into the men's apodyterium, which\r\ncould be entered also on the north side from the Strada delle Terme.\r\nThis room contained benches, as shown on the plan; but there were no\r\nniches, as in the dressing rooms of the Stabian Baths, and wooden\r\nshelves or lockers may have been used instead. The small dark chamber\r\nat the north end (_f_) may have been used as a storeroom for unguents,\r\nsuch as the Greeks called _elaeothesium_. It seems to have been\r\nthought necessary here to connect the dressing room with the furnace\r\nroom (V) by a separate passage.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 92.--Baths near the Forum: interior of the men's\r\n   tepidarium.]\r\n\r\nLight was admitted to the dressing room through a window in the\r\nlunette at the south end, closed by a pane of glass half an inch\r\nthick, set in a bronze frame that turned on two pivots. On either side\r\nof the window are huge Tritons in stucco relief, with vases on their\r\nshoulders, surrounded by dolphins; underneath is a mask of Oceanus,\r\nand in the same wall is a niche for a lamp, similar to that seen in\r\nFig. 92, blackened by the soot.\r\n\r\nThe frigidarium is well preserved. In all its arrangements it is\r\nalmost an exact counterpart of the one in the Stabian Baths, but the\r\nscheme of decoration, suggestive of a garden, is less realistically\r\ncarried out, the ground being yellow; and the round window at the apex\r\nof the domed ceiling has a rectangular extension toward the south in\r\norder to admit as much sunlight as possible.\r\n\r\nThe tepidarium, as will be seen from our illustration (Fig. 92), is in\r\nthe condition of the tepidariums of the Stabian Baths before the\r\nimproved arrangements for heating were introduced. There were no warm\r\nair chambers in the walls or the floor. At one end we see the remains\r\nof the large bronze brazier and benches (the iron grating is modern)\r\npresented by Vaccula, to which reference has already been made (p.\r\n197). The feet of the benches are modelled to represent hoofs, each\r\nwith a cow's head above.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 93.--Longitudinal section of the men's caldarium.]\r\n\r\nThere are niches in the walls, as formerly in the tepidariums of the\r\nStabian Baths, but several of them for some reason have been walled\r\nup. Wild-visaged, muscular Atlantes stand out in bold projection on\r\nthe front of the partitions between the niches, sustaining a cornice\r\nupon their uplifted hands. The window, seen in the illustration above\r\nthe lamp niche, was closed, as that in the dressing room, by a pane of\r\nglass in a bronze frame.\r\n\r\nThe decoration of the ceiling, unfortunately only in part preserved,\r\nis well designed. Along the lower edge are arabesques, interwoven in a\r\nscroll pattern, in white stucco on a white background. Above these are\r\npanels of different sizes, in which raised white ornaments and figures\r\nappear on a white, blue, or violet ground; among the motives are Cupid\r\nleaning on his bow, Apollo riding on a griffin, Ganymede with the\r\neagle, and Cupids on sea horses.\r\n\r\nThe caldarium is well preserved; only a part of the vaulted ceiling\r\nhas been destroyed. The hollow space for hot air in the floor and\r\nwalls is indicated in our section (Fig. 93). Here we see at the right,\r\nthe bath basin, lined with white marble, with its sloping back\r\naffording a comfortable support for the bathers; at the other end is\r\nthe apsidal niche (_schola_) with the labrum. The direction of\r\nVitruvius, that the labrum should be placed under a window in such a\r\nway that the shadows of those standing around should not fall on it,\r\nis here literally observed. There were three other small windows at\r\nthe same end of the room, and a niche for a lamp.\r\n\r\nWe learn from an inscription on the labrum, in bronze letters, that it\r\nwas made under the direction of Gnaeus Melissaeus Aper and Marcus\r\nStaius Rufus, who were duumvirs in 3-4 A.D., at a cost of 5250\r\nsesterces, not far from $270. This room seems to have received its\r\nfinal form before the new method of heating the water in the alveus\r\ncame into vogue; there is no trace of a bronze heater, such as that\r\nfound in connection with the bath basin of the women's caldarium at\r\nthe Stabian Baths. The simple decoration is in marked contrast with\r\nthe usual ornamentation of the later styles. Above a low marble base\r\nare yellow walls divided by dark red pilasters, shown in Fig. 93.\r\nThese support a projecting flat cornice of dark red, whose surface is\r\nrichly ornamented with stucco reliefs. The ceiling is moulded in\r\nflutings running up to the crown of the vault; only in the ceiling of\r\nthe schola do we find raised figures.\r\n\r\nThe rooms of the women's baths are small, their arrangement being\r\ndetermined in part by the irregular shape of the corner of the\r\nbuilding in which they are placed; but the system of heating is more\r\ncomplete than in the men's baths, for both the tepidarium (3) and the\r\ncaldarium (4) were provided with hollow floors and hot air spaces in\r\nthe walls extending to the lunettes and the ceiling. The vaulted\r\nceilings of both of these rooms, as well as of the apodyterium, are\r\npreserved; but the caldarium has lost its hollow floor and walls,\r\ntogether with the bath basin, which was placed in a large niche at the\r\nright as one entered; only the base of the labrum remains. The\r\ncondition of this room may be due to the earthquake of the year 63,\r\nthe necessary repairs not having been made before the eruption. There\r\nwas no connection between the women's baths and the court at the rear\r\n(D), which had a separate entrance from the street. At the women's\r\nentrance there was a narrow waiting room for attendants, separated\r\nfrom the street by a thin wall and protected by a roof.\r\n\r\nThe furnace room could be entered at one end from the street. The\r\nthree cylindrical tanks for hot, lukewarm, and cold water were\r\narranged as in the Stabian Baths. Beyond the tanks is a cistern (_g_),\r\nwhich was supplied in part by rain water from the roof, in part by a\r\nfeed pipe connected with the water system of the city. The raised walk\r\n(_h_) on the right side of the furnace room is continued to the small\r\ncourt (D) in the corner of which is a stairway leading to the flat\r\nroof of the men's caldarium. From this point of vantage, the view over\r\nthe landscape and the sea must have been beautiful in antiquity, as it\r\nis to-day.\r\n\r\nA sundial doubtless stood on the larger of the two pillars in the\r\ncourt (_d_), which is about seventeen feet high and nearly five feet\r\nthick at the base; on the smaller pillar was perhaps a statue or other\r\nornamental object of the sort frequently seen in wall paintings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n_THE CENTRAL BATHS_\r\n\r\n\r\nSeneca in an entertaining letter (Ep. 86) gives an account of a visit\r\nabout 60 A.D. to the villa at Liternum in which the Elder Scipio had\r\nlived in the years immediately preceding his death, in 183 B.C. The\r\nphilosopher was particularly struck with the bath, the simplicity of\r\nwhich he contrasts forcibly with the luxurious appointments of his own\r\ntime. We cannot follow him through the extended disquisition--he\r\nspeaks of various refinements of luxury of which we find no traces at\r\nPompeii; but he mentions as the most striking difference the lack of\r\nlight in the old bath, with its small apertures more like chinks than\r\nwindows, while in his day the baths were provided with large windows\r\nprotected by glass, and people 'wanted to be parboiled in full\r\ndaylight,' besides having the enjoyment meanwhile of a beautiful view.\r\nSome such feeling as this we have in turning from the two older baths\r\nat Pompeii--one of pre-Roman origin, the other dating from the time of\r\nSulla--to the Central Baths, which were in process of construction at\r\nthe time of the eruption, and had been designed in accordance with the\r\nprevailing mode of life.\r\n\r\nThis extensive establishment, at the corner of Stabian and Nola\r\nstreets, occupied the whole of a block; but a large part of the\r\nfrontage on the two streets mentioned was utilized for shops.\r\nNotwithstanding the size of the building, it had only a single series\r\nof apartments, which were laid out on a correspondingly large scale.\r\nIt was doubtless built for men, although the use of it at certain\r\nhours by women may possibly have been contemplated, in case the\r\nwomen's baths at the two other establishments should be overcrowded.\r\n\r\nEntrances from three streets lead to the ample palaestra, from which\r\nthe remains of the houses demolished to make room for it had not yet\r\nbeen entirely removed. On the northeast side is the excavation for a\r\nlarge swimming tank (_h_), and for a water channel leading to the\r\ncloset (_e_). In order to have water at hand for building purposes,\r\nthe masons had built a low wall around an old impluvium on the south\r\nside (shown on the plan, Fig. 94) into which a feed pipe ran. For a\r\nshort distance on the north side the stylobate had been made ready for\r\nthe building of the colonnade; elsewhere only the preliminary work had\r\nbeen done. The rooms at the southeast corner (_f_, _g_) were no doubt\r\nintended for dressing rooms for the palaestra and the plunge bath.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 94.--Plan of the Central Baths.\r\n\r\n     _d._ Palaestra.\r\n     _h._ Swimming tank.\r\n     _i_, _l._ Stores\r\n     _p._ Apodyterium.\r\n     _q._ Tepidarium.\r\n     _r._ Laconicum.\r\n     _s._ Caldarium.\r\n     _x_, _y._ Furnaces.]\r\n\r\nTwo small rooms (_b_, _c_) open upon the north entrance of the\r\npalaestra; one of them, perhaps, was to be a ticket office, for the\r\nadjustment of matters relating to admission, the other a cloak room,\r\nin which the _capsarius_ would guard the valuables of the bathers.\r\n\r\nTwo doors admit the visitor from the palaestra to the series of bath\r\nrooms, one of them opening from the north end of the colonnade. The\r\nfirst room (_i_, _l_) was designed to answer the purpose of a store,\r\nwith four booths (_k_, _m_, _n_, _o_) opening into it for the sale of\r\nedibles and bathers' conveniences.\r\n\r\nThe apodyterium (_p_), tepidarium (_q_), and caldarium (_s_) had each\r\nthree large windows opening on the palaestra; two of those belonging\r\nto the tepidarium are seen in Fig. 95. None of the rooms were\r\nfinished, though a hollow floor and hollow walls had been built in the\r\ntepidarium, caldarium, and Laconicum. The bath basins yet lacked their\r\nmarble linings, and the two furnaces (at _x_ and _y_) had not been\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\nFive smaller windows on the southeast side of the caldarium looked out\r\non a narrow garden, about which the workmen had commenced to build a\r\nwall to cut off the sight of the firemen passing to and fro between\r\nthe two furnaces. The caldarium was so placed as to receive the\r\ngreatest possible amount of sunlight, particularly in the afternoon\r\nhours, when it would be used; this was in accordance with a\r\nrecommendation of Vitruvius, who says that the windows of baths ought,\r\nwhenever possible, to face the southwest, otherwise the south.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 95.--View of the Central Baths, looking from the\r\n   palaestra into the tepidarium.]\r\n\r\nThe contrast is indeed marked between the numerous large windows here,\r\nwith their attractive outlook, and the small apertures, high in the\r\nwalls and ceiling, through which light was admitted in the older\r\nbaths.\r\n\r\nIn the Central Baths there was no frigidarium; but a large basin for\r\ncold baths, nearly five feet deep, was placed in the dressing room\r\nopposite the windows. Supply pipes were so laid that jets would spring\r\ninto the basin from three small niches, one in each wall; the overflow\r\nwas conducted by pipes under the floor to a catch basin (_w_), and\r\nthence to the street.\r\n\r\nThe tepidarium (_q_)--here, as usual, relatively small--is connected\r\nwith the apodyterium by two doors, and similarly with the caldarium.\r\nThe latter room has a bath basin at each end, thus affording\r\naccommodations for twenty-six or twenty-eight bathers at once; at the\r\nmiddle of the southeast side was a smaller basin that took the place\r\nof the labrum. The hot air flues leading from the furnaces under the\r\nbath basins were already built, and above them openings were left for\r\nsemi-cylindrical heaters like that in the women's caldarium of the\r\nStabian Baths.\r\n\r\nThe round sweating room, Laconicum, was made more ample by means of\r\nfour semicircular niches, and lighted by three small round windows\r\njust above the cornice of the domed ceiling. There was probably\r\nanother round opening at the apex, designed for a bronze shutter,\r\nwhich could be opened or closed from below by means of a chain, so as\r\nto regulate the temperature. Doors led into the Laconicum from both\r\nthe tepidarium and the caldarium.\r\n\r\nThe oblong court between the bath rooms and the street on the\r\nnortheast side was apparently to be laid out as a garden. At the north\r\nend the workmen had begun to build pillars for a short colonnade. A\r\nlarge square foundation for a sundial stands near the opposite corner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n_THE AMPHITHEATRE_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the southeast corner of the city, at a distance from the other\r\nexcavations, lies the Amphitheatre, the scene of gladiatorial combats.\r\nThe Pompeians called it 'the show,' _spectacula_, as in the\r\ninscription, preserved in two copies, that gives us the names of the\r\nbuilders: _C. Quinctius C. f. Valgus, M. Porcius M. f[ilius] duo\r\nvir[i] quinq[uennales] coloniai honoris caussa spectacula de sua\r\npeq[unia] fac[iunda] coer[arunt] et coloneis locum in perpetuom\r\ndeder[unt]_. According to this, the Amphitheatre was built by the same\r\nmen, Valgus and Porcius, who are already known to us as the builders\r\nof the Small Theatre (p. 153); and they presented it to the city in\r\nrecognition of the honor conferred upon them by their reelection as\r\nduumvirs. The Amphitheatre may thus have been finished half a decade\r\nlater than the Theatre, but in any case it belongs to the earliest\r\nyears of the Roman colony,--as might be inferred, in default of other\r\nevidence, from the archaic spelling of the inscription, and the\r\ncharacter of the masonry, which is like that of the Small Theatre and\r\nthe baths north of the Forum (p. 41).\r\n\r\nThe colonists, however, did not receive from Rome their impulse to\r\nerect such a building. The passion for gladiatorial combats was\r\ndeveloped in Campania earlier, and manifested itself more strongly,\r\nthan in Latium. Strabo's statement that gladiators were brought\r\nforward at Campanian banquets, in larger or smaller numbers according\r\nto the rank of the guests, has reference to the period before the\r\nSecond Punic War; but it was considered a noteworthy event in Rome\r\nwhen, in 264 B.C., gladiators engaged in combat in the Forum Boarium\r\nin celebration of funeral rites, as also when, on a similar occasion\r\nin 216 B.C., twenty-two pairs fought in the Forum. Buildings were\r\nerected for gladiatorial shows in Campanian towns earlier than at the\r\nCapital. As late as the year 46 B.C. the spectators who witnessed the\r\ngames given by Julius Caesar sat on wooden seats supported by\r\ntemporary staging; and the first stone amphitheatre in Rome was built\r\nby Statilius Taurus in 29 B.C., almost half a century after the\r\nquinquennial duumvirate of Valgus and Porcius. The Amphitheatre at\r\nPompeii is the oldest known to us from either literary or monumental\r\nsources.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with later and more imposing structures, our\r\nAmphitheatre seems indeed unpretentious. Its exterior elevation is\r\nrelatively low (Fig. 96); as our section shows (Fig. 99), the arena\r\nand the lower ranges of seats are in a great hollow excavated for the\r\npurpose below the level of the ground. The dimensions (length 460\r\nfeet, breadth 345) are small when compared with those of the Coliseum\r\n(615 and 510 feet, respectively) or even the amphitheatres at Capua or\r\nPozzuoli; and the lack of artistic form is noteworthy.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 96.--The Amphitheatre, seen from the west side.]\r\n\r\nThe exhibitions held here must also have been on a modest scale. There\r\nwere no underground chambers, below the arena, with devices by means\r\nof which wild beasts could be lifted up into view and the sand\r\nsuddenly covered with new combatants. The limited means of this small\r\ncity were not adequate to make provision for the elaborate equipment\r\nand costly decoration found in the amphitheatres of larger towns.\r\n\r\nThe arena, a view of which is given in Plate VI, is surrounded by a\r\nwall about 61/2 feet high. This wall was covered with frescoes which,\r\nstill fresh at the time of excavation, are now known to us only from\r\ncopies in the Naples Museum. They consisted of alternate broad and\r\nnarrow panels, the latter containing each a herm between two columns,\r\nwhile the larger spaces presented alternately a conventional pattern\r\nand a scene connected with the games. One of the scenes gives an\r\ninteresting glimpse of the preparations for the combat (Fig. 97). In\r\nthe middle we see the overseer marking out with a long staff the ring\r\nwithin which the combatants must fight. At the right a gladiator\r\nstands, partly armed; two attendants are bringing him a helmet and a\r\nsword. A hornblower, also partly armed, stands at the left; and behind\r\nhim two companions, squatting on the ground, make ready his helmet and\r\nshield. At either end of the scene, in the background, is an image of\r\na Winged Victory with a wreath and palm.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 97.--Preparations for the combat. Wall painting,\r\n   from the Amphitheatre.]\r\n\r\nThe limestone coping of the wall about the arena shows traces of iron\r\nin the joints between the blocks, apparently remains of a grating\r\ndesigned to protect the spectators from attacks by the infuriated wild\r\nbeasts. The traces are not visible all the way around, but this may be\r\naccounted for on the supposition that repairs were in progress at the\r\ntime of the eruption.\r\n\r\nTwo broad corridors (3, 3A) connect the ends of the arena with the\r\noutside of the building. The one at the north end, toward Vesuvius,\r\nfollows a straight line; the other bends sharply to the right in order\r\nto avoid the city wall, which bounds the structure on the south and\r\neast sides. By these corridors the gladiators entered the arena, first\r\nin festal array, passing in stately procession across the sand from\r\none entrance to the other, then coming forth in pairs as they were\r\nsummoned to mortal combat.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 98.--Plan of the Amphitheatre at different levels\r\n   showing, above, the arrangement of the seats; below, the arrangement\r\n   of the vaulted passages under the seats.\r\n\r\n     1.

Near the inner end of each of the three\r\ncorridors is a small, dark chamber (_f_) the purpose of which is\r\nunknown. It has been suggested that wild animals may have been\r\nconfined here, but larger and more easily accessible rooms would have\r\nbeen required for this purpose. They may have been storerooms for\r\nappliances of various kinds required for the exhibitions.\r\n\r\nThe seats, of which there are thirty-five rows, have the same form as\r\nthose in the Small Theatre, and are of the same material, gray tufa.\r\nThey are arranged in three divisions,--the lowest, _ima cavea_, having\r\nfive rows; the middle division, _media cavea_, twelve; and the\r\nhighest, _summa cavea_, eighteen (Figs. 98, 99). In the middle section\r\nof the ima cavea on each side the place of the seats is taken by four\r\nlow, broad ledges, set aside for members of the city council, who\r\ncould place upon them the seats of honor, _bisellia_, to the use of\r\nwhich they were entitled. At the middle of the east side the second\r\nledge is interrupted for a distance of ten feet (the break is shown in\r\nPlate VI), a double width being thus given to the lowest. This place\r\nwas designed for seats of special honor, and was, no doubt, reserved\r\nfor the official who provided the games, and his associates. On the\r\nsame side the ledges are extended into the next section on the south,\r\nthe continuity of the seats being interrupted by a low barrier. This\r\nsupplementary section was, perhaps, intended for certain freedmen, as\r\nthe Augustales (p. 100), who had the right to use bisellia, but who\r\nnevertheless could not become members of the city council, and were\r\nnot ranked on a social equality with the occupants of the middle\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nThe seats of the ima cavea and media cavea were reached through a\r\nvaulted passage (4), which, in accordance with ancient usage, we may\r\ncall a crypt. It ran under the first seats of the second range, and\r\nstairs led from it to both divisions. It might be entered either from\r\nthe two broad corridors leading to the arena, or directly from the\r\nwest side by means of two separate passages (_c_, _d_, on the plan).\r\nIt is, however, interrupted at the middle on each side of the\r\nAmphitheatre. On the west side the prolongation of the crypt would\r\nhave interfered with the use of the corridor leading to the Death\r\nGate; but as no such reason existed for blocking the east branch, it\r\nis probable that the designers of the Amphitheatre interrupted both\r\nbranches of the crypt in order to force the spectators who had seats\r\nin the lower and middle divisions of the south half of the\r\nstructure to enter and leave by the somewhat inconvenient south\r\nentrances, which are situated in an angle of the city wall. Had the\r\ncrypt been carried completely around, the crowd would always have\r\npressed into the building through the north entrances, which opened\r\ntoward the city, thus causing confusion, if not danger, on occasions\r\nof special interest.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE VI.--INTERIOR OF THE AMPHITHEATRE, LOOKING\r\n   NORTHWEST]\r\n\r\nIn the corridor leading from the north entrance, as may be seen on the\r\nplan, a row of stones with square holes in them were placed in the\r\npavement near the left wall. In these stakes could be set and\r\nconnected by ropes, thus making a narrow passageway along the side.\r\nThe purpose of the arrangement is not difficult to understand. Through\r\nthe north corridor the gladiators entered and left the building, and\r\nthe wild beasts were brought in; so provision had to be made to give\r\nthem a passage separate from that used by the spectators. Before the\r\ncommencement of an exhibition the whole entrance was accessible to the\r\npopulace, which eagerly crowded forward to secure seats in good\r\nseason. When they had for the most part found their places, the\r\nbarrier was set up, and only a narrow alley was left along the east\r\nwall for belated spectators who wished to pass into the crypt on that\r\nside; the rest of the passage was reserved for the gladiators, and the\r\nspectators whose seats were reached from the opposite branches of the\r\ncrypt were obliged to use the side entrance (_c_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 99.--Transverse section of the Amphitheatre.]\r\n\r\nThe middle division was separated from the summa cavea (8) by a low\r\nparapet with a narrow passage (_praecinctio_, _b_) on the upper side.\r\nThe seats of the summa cavea could be reached in two ways, by passing\r\nthrough the crypt and up the long flights of stairs that led through\r\nthe middle division to the top (best seen in Fig. 99), or by mounting\r\nthe stairs on the outside of the building to the terrace (10), which\r\nhas the same level as the highest rows of seats; it is also of the\r\nsame height as the city wall, with which it is merged on the south and\r\neast sides. The terrace was no doubt the principal means of access;\r\nample provision was made for the crowd by building two large double\r\nstairways (11), with smaller single flights at the corners where the\r\nterrace joined the city wall (12).\r\n\r\nBetween the terrace and the seats of the summa cavea was an elevated\r\ngallery, divided up into small boxes, about four feet square; under\r\nthe row of boxes were vaulted vomitoria, making the seats of the summa\r\ncavea accessible from the terrace. A passage ran along the outside of\r\nthe boxes, with steps leading from the terrace; only every third box\r\nwas connected with this passage, however, the other two of the group\r\nbeing entered from a narrow ramp along the front (Fig. 100).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 100.--Plan of the gallery.\r\n\r\n     1. Steps.\r\n     2. Boxes.]\r\n\r\nThe Amphitheatre had a seating capacity of about twenty thousand\r\npersons. We have no information in regard to the distribution of\r\nseats, but it may safely be assumed, from the arrangements known to\r\nhave existed elsewhere, that the lowest division was reserved for the\r\ncity officials with their friends and other prominent people; that an\r\nadmission fee was charged for the seats of the middle division; and\r\nthat the seats of the upper division were free. The gallery was\r\ndoubtless set aside for women, who were permitted by a regulation\r\npromulgated in the reign of Augustus to have a place only in the upper\r\nportion of the Amphitheatre.\r\n\r\nBesides the inscription giving the names of the builders (p. 212)\r\nthere are several others of interest in connection with the building.\r\nFour of them, cut in large letters in the travertine coping of the\r\nwall about the arena, commemorate the construction of seats. One\r\nreads: _L. Saginius II vir i. d. pr[o] lu[dis] lu[minibus] ex\r\nd[ecurionum] d[ecreto] cun[eum]_,--'Lucius Saginius, duumvir with\r\njudiciary authority, in accordance with a resolution of the city\r\ncouncil (constructed) a section of seats in the place of the games and\r\nillumination,' that otherwise he would have been required to provide.\r\nAnother of the series is even more abbreviated, but the meaning is\r\nclear: MAG . PAG . AUG . F . S . PRO . LUD . EX . D . D, that is,\r\n_Magistri Pagi Augusti Felicis Suburbani pro ludis ex decurionum\r\ndecreto_,--'The officials of the suburb Pagus Augustus Felix by\r\nauthority of a resolution of the city council (constructed a section\r\nof seats) in the place of providing games.'\r\n\r\nFrom an inscription in the Stabian Baths, to which reference has\r\nalready been made (p. 195), it is clear that some freedom of choice\r\nwas permitted to the city officials regarding the disposition of the\r\nsum which they were required to contribute for public purposes in\r\nrecognition of the honor conferred upon them by their election. The\r\nAmphitheatre was not provided with seats at the beginning, and one\r\nwedge-shaped section (_cuneus_) after another was added until the\r\ndivisions were complete; meanwhile the spectators made themselves as\r\ncomfortable as they could on the sloping ground. As the organization\r\nof the Pagus Augustus Felix did not take place till 7 B.C., the\r\nconstruction of the seats could not at that time have been completed;\r\nbut they were all finished before the overwhelming of the city.\r\n\r\nThe north entrance to the arena was adorned with two portrait statues\r\nof Gaius Cuspius Pansa, father and son, placed in niches in the walls\r\nfacing each other. The statues have disappeared, but the inscriptions\r\nunderneath are still in place. What services the Pansas had rendered\r\nin connection with the Amphitheatre to merit this distinction, we do\r\nnot know; but the father, as the inscription indicates, was 'prefect\r\nin accordance with the law of Petronius' (p. 14); that is, he was\r\nappointed by the city council to exercise the functions of the two\r\nduumvirs when no valid election occurred. Bulwer Lytton, by a natural\r\nerror, makes Pansa a commissioner to secure the execution of an\r\naltogether different _Lex Petronia_, which forbade the giving of\r\nslaves to wild beasts unless judicial sentence had been previously\r\npassed upon them.\r\n\r\nThe attraction of the gladiatorial exhibitions, together with the\r\nample seating capacity of the building, stimulated attendance from\r\nneighboring cities, and on one occasion unfortunate results followed.\r\nIn the year 59 A.D. a Roman senator, Livineius Regulus, who had been\r\nexpelled from the Senate, and had apparently taken up his residence\r\nat Pompeii, gave an exhibition that attracted a great concourse. Among\r\nthose who came to witness the combats were many inhabitants of\r\nNuceria. The people of the two towns may not have been on the best of\r\nterms previously; whatever the cause, the Pompeians and Nucerians\r\ncommenced with mutual bantering and recriminations, then resorted to\r\nstone-throwing, and finally engaged in a free fight with weapons.\r\n\r\nThe Nucerians, as can easily be understood, fared the worse, having\r\nmany killed and wounded. They carried the matter to Rome, lodging a\r\ncomplaint with Nero; the emperor referred the case to the Senate,\r\nwhich decreed that Regulus and the leaders of the disturbance should\r\nbe sent into exile, that the Pompeians should not be permitted to hold\r\nany gladiatorial exhibitions for the space of ten years, and that the\r\nillegal societies at Pompeii--in regard to which, unfortunately, we\r\nhave no further information--should be dissolved. From the receipts of\r\nCaecilius Jucundus we learn, further, that the duumvirs of the year 59\r\nwere removed from office, and that with the new duumvirs, elected in\r\ntheir places, a magistrate with extraordinary powers, _praefectus iuri\r\ndicundo_, was associated--measures that indicate how serious the\r\ndisturbance of public order must have been.\r\n\r\nReminiscences of this bloody fray are found in several inscriptions\r\nscratched on walls; and a lively idea of it is given by a wall\r\npainting found in 1869 in a house near the theatres, now in the Naples\r\nMuseum (Fig. 101). The picture is of special interest as throwing\r\nlight on the surroundings of the Amphitheatre and some of its\r\narrangements. The open space with the trees in the foreground, among\r\nwhich are various booths, remind one of a park; at the right is a\r\nsingle house. It is clear from the painting that the women's boxes, in\r\nthe gallery, were arched in front; and we see how the great awning,\r\n_velum_, was stretched over the south end to protect the audience from\r\nthe sun. It was carried by the two towers of the city wall (one of\r\nthem is indicated on the plan, 13) and by masts that stood in the\r\npassage behind the women's boxes, where several of the perforated\r\nstones in which they were set may still be seen.\r\n\r\nThat the sports of the Amphitheatre had at all times the keenest\r\ninterest for the Pompeians is evident, not only from the number of\r\nnotices having to do with the games, which we see painted in red on\r\nwalls along the streets or on tombs by the roadside, but also from the\r\ncountless graffiti in both houses and public places having reference\r\nto combats and favorite gladiators. The limits of space do not permit\r\nus to describe the gladiatorial exhibitions as they took place at\r\nPompeii and other Roman cities; but the inscriptions bring so near to\r\nus the scenes and excitement of those days that it seems worth while\r\nto quote and interpret a few typical examples.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 101.--Conflict between the Pompeians and the\r\n   Nucerians. Wall painting.]\r\n\r\nOn a tomb near the Nuceria Gate, excavated in 1886, is the following\r\nnotice, painted in red letters: _Glad[iatorum] par[ia] XX Q. Monni\r\nRufi pug[nabunt] Nola K[alendis] Mais, VI. V. Nonas Maias, et venatio\r\nerit_,--'Twenty pairs of gladiators, furnished by Quintus Monnius\r\nRufus, will fight at Nola May 1, 2, and 3, and there will be a hunt.'\r\nThe forms of the letters and the numerous ligatures point to a\r\ncomparatively early period, perhaps antedating the reign of Augustus.\r\nThe 'hunt,' _venatio_, was an exhibition of wild beasts, which\r\nsometimes were pitted against one another, sometimes fought with men.\r\nAnother tomb close by bears a notice of a gladiatorial combat to take\r\nplace at Nuceria.\r\n\r\nA still larger number of gladiators is announced in this notice: _Cn.\r\nAllei Nigidi Mai quinq[uennalis] gl[adiatorum] par[ia] XXX et eor[um]\r\nsupp[ositicii] pugn[abunt] Pompeis VIII VII VI K[alendas] Dec[embres].\r\nVen[atio] erit. Maio quin[quennali] feliciter. Paris va[le]_,--'Thirty\r\npairs of gladiators furnished by Cn. Alleius Nigidius Maius,\r\nquinquennial duumvir, together with their substitutes, will fight at\r\nPompeii November 24, 25, 26. There will be a hunt. Hurrah for Maius\r\nthe quinquennial! Bravo, Paris!' The substitutes were to take the\r\nplace of the killed or wounded, that the sport might not suffer\r\ninterruption. Nigidius Maius appears to have been a rich Pompeian of\r\nthe time of Claudius. In another painted inscription, he advertises a\r\nconsiderable property for rent (p. 489). His daughter, as we know from\r\nan inscription belonging to a statue erected in her honor, was a\r\npriestess of Venus and Ceres. Paris was probably a popular gladiator.\r\n\r\nOther officials besides duumvirs provided exhibitions. Thus an aedile:\r\n_A. Suetti Certi aedilis familia gladiatoria pugnab[it] Pompeis\r\npr[idie] K[alendas] Iunias; venatio et vela erunt_,--'The gladiatorial\r\ntroop of the aedile Aulus Suettius Certus will fight at Pompeii May\r\n31; there will be a hunt, and awnings will be provided.'\r\n\r\nThe following notice can be dated, approximately: _D. Lucreti Satri\r\nValentis flaminis Neronis Caesaris Aug[usti] fili perpetui gladiatorum\r\nparia XX, et D. Lucreti Valentis fili glad[iatorum] paria X\r\npug[nabunt] Pompeis VI V IV III pr[idie] Idus Apr[iles]. Venatio\r\nlegitima et vela erunt. Scr[ipsit] Aemilius Celer sing[ulus] ad\r\nluna[m]_,--'Twenty pairs of gladiators furnished by Decimus Lucretius\r\nSatrius Valens, permanent priest of Nero, son of the emperor, and ten\r\npairs of gladiators furnished by Decimus Lucretius Valens his son,\r\nwill fight at Pompeii April 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. There will be a big\r\nhunt, and awnings. Aemilius Celer wrote this, all alone by the light\r\nof the moon.' The reference to Nero as the son of the emperor, shows\r\nthat the inscription was written after he was adopted by Claudius, in\r\n50 A.D., and before Claudius's death, in 54. Celer was an enterprising\r\npainter of notices, whose name appears elsewhere in a similar\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nBesides the general announcement of a gladiatorial exhibition, a\r\ndetailed programme, _libellus_, was prepared in advance, of which\r\ncopies were sold. No such copy has come down to us, but the character\r\nof the contents of a programme may be inferred from the order of\r\nevents which a Pompeian with waste time on his hands scratched on a\r\nwall; the memorandum covers two exhibitions, which came near together\r\nin the early part of May, the result of each combat being carefully\r\nnoted. Unfortunately the letters have now become almost illegible; but\r\nwe give the superscription and three of the nine pairs of combatants\r\nmentioned in the second programme, which is the better preserved of\r\nthe two, adding in a separate column the full forms of the abbreviated\r\nwords; the figures indicate the number of combats in which the\r\ndifferent gladiators had taken part:--\r\n\r\n   MUNUS.N ...

The contests extended over four days, May 12-15.\r\n\r\nIn the first pair of gladiators Pugnax, equipped with Thracian\r\nweapons--a small, round shield and short, curved sword or dagger--was\r\nmatched with the Myrmillo Murranus, who bore arms of the Gallic\r\nfashion, with the image of a fish on his helmet. Both were\r\n_Neroniani_; that is, from the training school for gladiators founded\r\nby Nero, apparently at Capua. Pugnax and Murranus had both been\r\nthrough three contests previously. The name of a gladiator entering a\r\ncombat for the first time was not followed by a number, but by the\r\nletter T, standing for _tiro_, 'novice.' At the left we see the record\r\nadded to the programme by the writer in order to give the result of\r\nthe combat. Pugnax was the victor, Murranus was killed.\r\n\r\nIn the second pair Cycnus, in heavy armor, was pitted against Atticus,\r\nwho had the Thracian arms. Both were from the training school founded\r\nby Julius Caesar, probably at Capua, and hence are called _Iuliani_.\r\nCycnus won, but the audience had compassion on Atticus, and his life\r\nwas spared. The same term was applied to a defeated gladiator\r\npermitted to leave the arena as to a soldier having an honorable\r\ndischarge--_missus_, 'let go.'\r\n\r\nThe third pair fought in chariots, being dressed in British costume.\r\nScylax was from the Julian school. Such establishments let out\r\ngladiators to those who gave exhibitions, and obtained in this way a\r\nconsiderable income. But Publius Ostorius, as his name implies, was a\r\nfreeman; presumably he was a gladiator, who, having served a full\r\nterm, had secured his freedom, and was now fighting on his own\r\naccount. Though beaten, he was permitted to live, perhaps on account\r\nof his creditable record; he had engaged in fifty-one combats.\r\n\r\nThe combatants from the schools of Caesar and Nero were especially\r\npopular, and were generally victorious; but gladiators belonging to\r\nother proprietors are mentioned, as in the inscriptions of a house on\r\nNola Street, which will be mentioned again presently. Here we find\r\ngladiators who were evidently freemen named with others who were\r\nslaves of different masters. In only one of these inscriptions,\r\nhowever, do we find the name of an owner that is known to us:\r\n_Essed[arius] Auriolus Sisen[nae]_. The chariot fighter Auriolus\r\nbelonged to a Sisenna, seemingly either the Sisenna Statilius Taurus,\r\nwho was consul in 16 A.D., or his son of the same name. As we have\r\nseen, it was a Statilius Taurus who built the first permanent\r\namphitheatre in Rome, in 29 B.C. The control of this building remained\r\nin the hands of the family. In the columbarium in which the ashes of\r\ntheir slaves and freedmen were placed, we find inscriptions of a\r\n'guard of the amphitheatre,' and of a 'doorkeeper'--_custos de\r\namphitheatro_, _ostiarius ab amphitheatro_. It is highly probable that\r\nthe family--the first in Rome after the imperial house--possessed a\r\ntraining school, and derived an income from furnishing gladiators to\r\nthose who gave exhibitions.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts, we must suppose that the 'troop' (_familia\r\ngladiatoria_) of Suettius Certus, for example, was simply a band of\r\ngladiators brought together for a particular engagement, not a\r\npermanent organization. The giver of an exhibition would make a\r\ncontract for the gladiators that he might need. At the close of the\r\ncombats the dead would be counted, the surviving freemen paid off and\r\ndismissed, and the surviving slaves returned to their masters, 'the\r\ntroop' thus going out of existence.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the individual who provided the combats would erect a\r\nmonument to the fallen, by way of perpetuating the memory of his\r\nmunificence. A familiar example is the memorial set up by Gaius\r\nSalvius Capito at Venosa, of which the inscription is extant. The\r\nnames are given of the gladiators who were killed, together with the\r\nnumber of their previous combats and victories. They were slaves of\r\ndifferent masters, only one of them, Optatus, being owned by Capito\r\nhimself. Optatus was a tiro, who fell thus in his first contest.\r\nPossibly his master had obliged him, on account of some misdemeanor,\r\nto enter the arena with little previous training.\r\n\r\nBesides the classes of inscriptions of which examples have been\r\npresented, all sorts of scratches upon the plastered walls bear\r\nwitness to the general enthusiasm for gladiatorial sports. Sometimes\r\nthere is simply the name of a gladiator, with his school and the\r\nnumber of combats, as _Auctus, Iul[ianus], XXXXX_; sometimes we find a\r\nrough outline of a figure with a boastful legend, as _Hermaiscus\r\ninvictus hac_, 'Here's the unconquered Hermaiscus.'\r\n\r\nThere are also memoranda in regard to particular combats, illustrated\r\nby rude sketches. Thus on a wall in the house of the Centenary we find\r\na drawing of a gladiator in flight, pursued by another, with the note:\r\n_Officiosus fugit VIII Idus Nov[embres] Druso Caesare M. Iunio Silano\r\ncos._,--'Officiosus fled on November 6, in the year 15 A.D.' A similar\r\nsketch has been found in another house, with these words written\r\nbeside the fleeing gladiator, _Q. P[e]tronius O[c]ta[v]us XXXIII,\r\nm[issus]_; beside the pursuer, _Severus lib[ertus], XXXXXV, v[icit]_.\r\nSeverus was thus a gladiator who had been a slave, and had gained his\r\nfreedom: he had fought fifty-five combats. Petronius Octavus may have\r\nbeen a freeman, who had fought on his own account from the beginning.\r\nIn taverns a painting of a gladiator with an inscription like the\r\nrecord of a programme was a favorite subject of decoration.\r\n\r\nAthletes in all ages have won the admiration of the gentler sex; and\r\nit would be surprising if among so many gladiatorial graffiti there\r\nwere not some containing references to female admirers. In the\r\nperistyle of a house on Nola Street (V. v. 3) the names of about\r\nthirty gladiators are found; the kinds of weapons and the owners are\r\ndesignated, and the number of previous combats given, as in the\r\nprogrammes, while records of the results of the combats are entirely\r\nlacking. Terms of endearment are lavished upon two, Celadus, Threx,\r\nand Crescens, net fighter; Celadus is _suspirium puellarum_, 'maidens'\r\nsigh,' and _puellarum decus_, 'glory of girls'; while Crescens is\r\n_puparum dominus_, 'lord o' lassies,' and _puparum medicus_, 'the\r\ndarlings' doctor.'\r\n\r\nAnother graffito informs us that at one time--before the year 63--a\r\ngladiator lived in this house: _Samus / [^C] / m[urmillo], idem eq[ues],\r\nhic hab[itat]_,--'Samus, who has fought once, and once conquered (_[^C]_\r\nis for _corona_, 'crown'), Myrmillo, and at the same time fighter on\r\nhorseback, lives here.' Other gladiators, no doubt, shared the\r\ndwelling with him; and the amatory graffiti may have been written by\r\none and another _miles gloriosus_, referring to conquests outside the\r\narena, or by companions in bitter scorn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n_STREETS, WATER SYSTEM, AND WAYSIDE SHRINES_\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 102.--View of Abbondanza Street, looking east.\r\n\r\n   At the left, fountain of Concordia Augusta, and side entrance of the\r\n   Eumachia building. In the pavement, three stepping stones.]\r\n\r\nThe streets of Pompeii vary greatly in width. The widest is Mercury\r\nStreet, the continuation of which near the Forum has a breadth of\r\nnearly 32 feet. Next come Abbondanza and Nola streets, the greatest\r\nwidth of which is about 28 feet; the other streets and thoroughfares\r\nvary from 10 to 20 feet. With unimportant exceptions, broad and narrow\r\nstreets alike are paved with polygonal blocks of basalt, which in\r\nlaying were fitted to one another with great care; on both sides are\r\nraised sidewalks, with basalt or tufa curbing. The sidewalks in some\r\nplaces are paved with small stones, elsewhere are laid with concrete,\r\nor left with a surface of beaten earth. As there is no uniformity, the\r\nsidewalk varying in front of adjoining houses, it is clear that the\r\nchoice of materials was left to individual owners of abutting\r\nproperty. The limits of ownership are often designated by boundary\r\nstones, laid in the surface of the walk.\r\n\r\nBroad ruts, worn by wheels, are seen in the pavement, shallower in\r\nplaces where the basalt flags, cut from the lowest stratum of the\r\nstream of lava, are particularly hard; deeper wherever there are\r\nblocks quarried nearer the surface. Only the principal streets were\r\nwide enough to allow wagons to meet and pass; elsewhere drivers must\r\nhave waited at a corner for a coming team to go by. It seems likely\r\nthat driving on the streets of the city was forbidden, wheeled\r\nvehicles being used only for traffic; people who wished to ride\r\navailed themselves of litters.\r\n\r\nAt various places along the thoroughfares, but particularly at the\r\ncorners, large oblong stepping stones with rounded corners were set in\r\nthe pavement at convenient distances for those wishing to cross, the\r\nsurface being on a level with the sidewalk. The number varied\r\naccording to the width of the pavement; in the broadest streets as\r\nmany as five were used. They were arranged always in such a way as to\r\nleave places for the wagon wheels. It is not difficult to understand\r\nhow Pompeian drivers guided their teams past them; draft animals were\r\nattached to the wagon by means of a yoke fastened to the end of the\r\npole, and, as there were no tugs or whippletrees, they had a greater\r\nfreedom of movement than is allowed to modern teams.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that so complete a system of paving existed\r\nfrom the beginning of the city. Some light is thrown on the period of\r\nits laying by two inscriptions,--one, EX . K . QUI, cut in the edge of\r\nthe sidewalk west of Insula IX. iv.; the other, K . Q, in the pavement\r\nbetween the second and fourth Insulae of Region VII. Both are\r\nevidently dates, and in full would read _ex Kalendis Quinctilibus_,\r\n'from the first day of July,' and _Kalendis Quinctilibus_, 'July 1.'\r\nApparently they relate to the laying of the pavement; this was in\r\nplace, even in the unimportant side street of Region VII, when the\r\ninscriptions were cut, and so must go back to the time before the name\r\nof the month _Quinctilis_ was changed to _Iulius_, our July. Pompeii\r\nwas paved, therefore, before 44 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe stepping stones were particularly useful when there was a heavy\r\nrain; for the water then flowed in torrents down the streets, as it\r\ndoes to-day in Catania, where the inhabitants have light bridges which\r\nthey throw over the crossings after a storm. There were covered\r\nconduits to carry off the surface drainage of the Forum, one of which\r\nruns under the Strada delle Scuole to the south, the other under the\r\nVia Marina to the west. Elsewhere the water rushed down the streets\r\ntill it came near the city walls, where it was collected and carried\r\noff by large storm sewers. These are still in successful operation, as\r\nare also the conduits at the Forum. One is at the west end of the Vico\r\ndei Soprastanti, another at the west end of Nola Street; and a third\r\nleads from Abbondanza Street, where it is crossed by Stabian Street,\r\ntoward the south.\r\n\r\nThere were other sewers in the city, but they were of small dimensions\r\nand have not been fully investigated. They seem generally to have been\r\nunder sidewalks. They were not designed to receive surface water, but\r\nthe drainage of houses. They cannot have served this purpose fully,\r\nhowever, for most of the closets were connected, not with the sewers,\r\nbut with cesspools.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of more than eighteen centuries, the visitor at\r\nPompeii will distinguish at a glance the business streets from those\r\nless frequented. The sides of the former are lined with shops; along\r\nthe latter are blank walls, broken only by house doors, with now and\r\nthen a small window high above the pavement. The greatest volume of\r\nbusiness was transacted on the two main thoroughfares, Stabian and\r\nNola streets; next in importance were Abbondanza Street, leading from\r\nthe Forum toward the Sarno Gate, and the continuation of Augustales\r\nStreet from the north end of the Forum toward the east. First in the\r\nlist of quiet thoroughfares is the broad Mercury Street, along which\r\nwere many homes of wealth; the north end of it is closed by the city\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nThere were many fountains along the streets of Pompeii, most of them\r\nat the corners. They were fed by pipes connecting with the water\r\nsystem of the city. The construction is simple. A deep basin was made\r\nby placing on their edges four large slabs of basalt, held together at\r\nthe corners by iron clamps. Above one of the longer sides, usually\r\nnear the middle, is a short, thick standard, of the same stone,\r\npierced for the lead feed pipe, which threw a jet of water forward\r\ninto the basin below; on the opposite side is a depression through\r\nwhich the superfluous water ran off into the street. Most of these\r\nstandards are ornamented with reliefs, roughly carved but\r\neffective,--an eagle with a hare in its beak, a calf's head, a bust of\r\nMercury, a head of Medusa, a drunken Silenus (Fig. 103), or some other\r\nsuitable design, arranged so that the water would spurt from the mouth\r\nof the figure or from an amphora.\r\n\r\nOccasionally we find a fountain of finer material. That of Concordia\r\nAugusta, of limestone, has already been mentioned (p. 117). In the\r\nneighborhood of the Porta Marina there is a fountain of white marble\r\nwith a relief showing a cock that has tipped over a jar, from the\r\nmouth of which the water flowed. Both these more costly fountains were\r\nprobably the gift of private individuals, one presented to the city by\r\nEumachia, the other by the owner of the nearest house, at VII. xv.\r\n1-2. All the fountains bear witness to long use by the depressions\r\nworn in the stone by the hands of those leaning forward to drink.\r\n\r\nWater towers stand at the sides of the streets, small pillars of\r\nmasonry preserved ordinarily to the height of 20 feet. Usually on one\r\nside there is a deep perpendicular groove (shown in Fig. 103) in which\r\nran the pipe that carried the water to the top of the tower, where it\r\nwas received by a small open reservoir, presumably of metal, and\r\ndistributed through numerous small pipes leading to the fountains and\r\nto private houses. The sides of the towers are often covered with\r\nincrustations of lime deposited from the water, in which the\r\nimpressions of the lead pipes are still to be seen; in the case of one\r\ntower, at the northeast corner of Insula VI. xiii, a number of the\r\npipes have been preserved. A reservoir was placed also on the top of\r\nthe commemorative arch at the lower end of Mercury Street, on which\r\nstood the bronze statue of Nero or Caligula (p. 48); the traces of the\r\npipes leading from it are clearly seen on the surface of the arch.\r\nSimilar water towers are in use now in Constantinople and Palermo,\r\nhaving been introduced into the latter city, it would seem, by the\r\nSaracens, who very likely took their water system from that of the\r\nTurkish capital.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 103.--Fountain, water tower, and street shrine,\r\n   corner of Stabian and Nola streets.]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these arrangements, Pompeii was well supplied with\r\nwater. There were flowing jets in all houses except the poorest, and\r\nin some the amount used must have been large. In the house of the\r\nVettii there were no less than sixteen jets, in the house of the\r\nSilver Wedding, seven; and an equally generous distribution is found\r\nin many other of the more extensive private establishments. Large\r\nquantities of water were used also in the public baths. The water\r\npipes were made of sheet lead folded together, a transverse section\r\nshowing the shape of a pear. They were of all sizes, according to the\r\npressure; the flow of water was regulated by means of stopcocks, much\r\nlike those in use to-day.\r\n\r\nAcross the street from the Baths near the Forum, on the west, is a\r\ndeep reservoir, of which we give the plan (Fig. 104). It is built\r\npartly below the level of the sidewalk, and measures about 50 feet in\r\nlength and 13 in width, being covered by a vault. In the south end is\r\na window (_c_), reached from one of the stairways; when the reservoir\r\nwas filled to the bottom of the window, it contained not far from\r\nninety-five thousand gallons. There were two outlets. One was at the\r\nlevel of the floor, closed by means of a bronze slide; the grooves in\r\nwhich the slide worked are preserved. This must have been used only\r\nwhen the reservoir was cleaned. The other outlet was placed about\r\nthree feet above the floor, so that the water could be drawn off\r\nwithout disturbing the bottom. On the flat roof were rooms the\r\narrangement of which cannot be determined.\r\n\r\nSimilar reservoirs are found in Constantinople, designed to furnish a\r\nsupply of water in case of siege. Such may have been the purpose of\r\nour structure, which seems to have been built in the early years of\r\nthe Roman colony. The residents, remembering the hardships of the\r\nsiege of Sulla, may have thought it necessary to make provision\r\nagainst a similar strait in the future.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 104.--Plan of reservoir, west of the Baths near\r\n   the Forum.\r\n\r\n     _a_, _b_, _c_. Windows.\r\n     _d_, _e_. Stairs.]\r\n\r\nThe source from which the city received its water supply has not been\r\ndiscovered. Evidently it did not draw upon the sources of the Sarno;\r\nthe water channel constructed by Fontana (p. 25) runs through the city\r\nat a height of less than sixty feet above the level of the sea, while\r\nthe ancient aqueduct that supplied Pompeii had so great a head that in\r\nthe highest parts of the city, more than 130 feet above the sea, it\r\nforced the water to the top of the water towers, at least twenty feet\r\nmore. Copious springs can never have existed on the sides of Vesuvius;\r\nwater must have been brought to the city from the more distant\r\nmountains bounding the Campanian plain on the east.\r\n\r\nWe can hardly believe that the construction of a water channel for so\r\ngreat a distance lay within the resources of so small a town. We find,\r\nhowever, the remains of a great aqueduct which, starting near\r\nAvellino, a dozen miles east of Nola, skirted the base of Vesuvius on\r\nthe north and extended westward, furnishing water not only to Naples\r\nbut also to Puteoli, Baiae, and Misenum. This ancient structure drew\r\nfrom the same springs, and followed substantially the same route, as\r\nthe new aqueduct which since 1885 has been bringing water to Naples.\r\nNo inscription in regard to it has been found, and there is no\r\nreference to it in ancient books. The remains--of which the longest\r\nsection, known as Ponti Rossi, 'Red Bridges,' may be seen near\r\nNaples--seem to indicate two styles of construction, extensive repairs\r\nhaving been made after the aqueduct had been partly destroyed; but up\r\nto the present time it has not been possible to determine the period\r\nto which they belong.\r\n\r\nThe water system of Pompeii goes back to the time before the founding\r\nof the Roman colony. This is evident, not only from the arrangements\r\nof the older baths, which contemplated a freer use of water than could\r\nwell have been provided by cisterns, but also from the existence of\r\nthree marble supports for fountain basins, which, as shown by their\r\nstyle of workmanship, the use of Oscan letters as mason's marks, and\r\ntheir location in pre-Roman buildings--the temple of Apollo, the Forum\r\nTriangulare, and the house of the Faun--belonged to the earlier\r\nperiod. If we may ascribe the building of the great aqueduct to the\r\ntime of peace and prosperity in Campania between the Second Punic War\r\nand the Social War, and suppose that Pompeii, joining with other towns\r\nin its construction, was supplied by a branch from it, we have a\r\nsimple and highly probable solution of the problem. Nothing in the\r\ncharacter of the masonry requires us to assign the aqueduct to a later\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe shrines along the streets, with few exceptions, were dedicated to\r\nthe guardian deities presiding over thoroughfares, particularly the\r\ngods of street crossings, _Lares Compitales_. The worship of these\r\ndivinities in Rome was reorganized by Augustus and placed in charge of\r\nthe precinct wardens, _vicorum magistri_, who were to see that the\r\nworship of his guardian spirit, Genius, was associated with that of\r\nthe Lares at each shrine. The arrangements at the Capital were\r\nnaturally followed by the colonies and other cities under Roman rule.\r\n\r\nAt Pompeii the shrines of the street gods differ greatly in size and\r\ncharacter. Sometimes there is a small altar against the side of a\r\nbuilding, with two large serpents, personifications of the Genius of\r\nthe place, painted on the wall near it; one of the serpents, with a\r\nconspicuous crest, represents a male, the other, a female.\r\n\r\nFrequently the place of the altar is taken by a niche, in which the\r\npasser-by could deposit his offering. In our illustration (Fig. 105)\r\nwe see an ancient street altar which was carefully preserved when the\r\nCentral Baths were built, a niche being made over it in the new wall.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 105.--Ancient altar in new wall, southeast corner\r\n   of the Central Baths.]\r\n\r\nSometimes a large altar is found, and the Lares, with their offerings,\r\nare painted on a wall above it. Such a shrine may be seen at the\r\nnorthwest corner of Stabian and Nola streets, between the fountain and\r\nthe water tower (Fig. 103). Back of the altar is a wall terminating in\r\na gable (the tiles are modern) on which was a painted altar with four\r\nworshippers clad in togas, and a fluteplayer, the inseparable\r\naccompaniment of a Roman sacrificial scene; at the sides were the two\r\nLares, represented as youths, in loose tunics confined by a girdle,\r\nholding in one hand, high uplifted, a drinking horn (_rhyton_), from\r\nwhich a jet of wine flows into a small pail (_situla_) in the other\r\nhand. It is remarkable that we do not find in this or similar\r\npaintings at Pompeii, any figure representing the Genius of the\r\nemperor, while in private houses the Genius of the proprietor often\r\nhas a place with the Lares, and sometimes the Genius of the emperor\r\nalso; in theory at least, as already remarked (p. 104), the emperor\r\nstood to all men in the relation that the master of a house bore to\r\nthe household.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 106.--Plan of a chapel of the Lares Compitales.]\r\n\r\nThere is also a small chapel for the worship of the street gods on the\r\nwest side of Stabian Street, near Abbondanza Street. As may be seen\r\nfrom the accompanying plan (Fig. 106), at the left as you enter is a\r\nbench of masonry (1), at the rear a long altar (2). In the wall at the\r\nright is a niche for the bronze or terra cotta figures of the Lares\r\nand the Genius, while the surface of the altar is divided into two\r\nparts, for the separate worship of the same divinities. A similar\r\nchapel is situated on the west side of Mercury Street (VI. viii. 14).\r\nHere also we find a bench of masonry, with two niches above it; in the\r\nmiddle was a block of limestone which may have been used as an altar.\r\nAt the rear is a door leading into a small back room. This chapel was\r\nformerly thought to be a barber shop.\r\n\r\nIt has been customary to assign to the street gods all of the shrines\r\nat the side of the street. Occasionally, however, other divinities\r\nwere thus honored; and the only street altar found with an inscription\r\nis consecrated to a different deity. This altar is near Nola Street,\r\non the east side of Insula IX. vii. On the wall above two cornucopias\r\nare painted the words _Salutei sacrum_, 'Sacred to Salus'; the goddess\r\nof health was worshipped here.\r\n\r\nNear the upper end of the Forum, on the north side of Insula VII. vii,\r\nis another altar, above which is a stucco relief representing a\r\nsacrifice; at the sides of the relief are pilasters, and over it a\r\ngable, in which an eagle is seen. This indicates that the shrine was\r\ndedicated to Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThe largest of the street altars, of tufa, stands free in a vaulted\r\nniche on the north side of Insula VIII. ii, but no traces of painting\r\nare to be seen near it (Fig. 107).\r\n\r\nVarious divinities are painted on the outside of houses. The largest\r\npicture of this kind is at the corner of Abbondanza Street, on the\r\neast side of Insula VIII. iii. It contains figures of the twelve gods,\r\ndistinguished by their attributes--Vesta, Diana, Apollo, Ceres,\r\nMinerva, Jupiter, Juno, Vulcan, Venus Pompeiana, Mars, Neptune, and\r\nMercury. Underneath are the two serpents, facing each other, on either\r\nside of a painted altar; near the altar are other figures that cannot\r\nbe plainly distinguished, probably of men offering sacrifice. This is\r\nnot a shrine--there is no place for the offerings. The owner of the\r\nproperty (house of the Boar), desired to place his household under the\r\nprotection of these gods, perhaps also to preserve the corner from\r\ndefilement. We often find roughly sketched figures of single gods, to\r\nthe guardian care of whom the master of a house wished to commit his\r\ninterests--most frequently Mercury, the patron divinity of traders,\r\nand Bacchus; but also Jupiter, Minerva, and Hercules.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 107.--Large street altar.]\r\n\r\nSometimes merely a pair of serpents are painted on a wall, in order to\r\ngive a religious association to the place, as a means of protection.\r\nIn one case (east side of Insula VII. xi. 12) an explicit warning was\r\npainted on the plaster beside them: _Otiosis locus hic non est;\r\ndiscede, morator_,--'No place for loafers here; move along!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n_THE DEFENCES OF THE CITY_\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the military point of view, Pompeii at the time of the eruption\r\ndid not possess a system of defences. For many years previously the\r\ncity wall had been kept in repair only as a convenience in matters of\r\ncivil administration, and the gates had long since lost all appearance\r\nof preparedness to resist attack. The fortifications are not, however,\r\nwithout interest. They form a massive and conspicuous portion of the\r\nruins, and as a survival from an earlier period they have recorded\r\nmany evidences of the successive changes through which the city\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the wall to the configuration of the height on which\r\nPompeii stood was pointed out in connection with our general survey of\r\nthe city (p. 31). Along the southwest side, at the time of the\r\neruption, it had almost completely disappeared. Here, where the slope\r\nwas steepest and the city best defended by nature, the wall had been\r\nremoved, and its place occupied by houses, at a comparatively early\r\ndate, probably in the second century B.C.; enough fragments remain,\r\nhowever, to enable us to determine its location with certainty.\r\nElsewhere the greater part of the wall is in a fair state of\r\npreservation. The towers did not belong to the original structure, and\r\none of the gates in its present form is of still more recent origin.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the wall will be readily understood with the help\r\nof the accompanying illustrations.\r\n\r\nFirst, two parallel stone walls were built, about 15 feet apart and 28\r\ninches thick; both walls were strengthened on the side toward the city\r\nby numerous buttresses, the inner wall being further supported by\r\nmassive abutments projecting into the space between (Fig. 108). This\r\nspace was filled with earth.\r\n\r\nWhen the desired height, 26 or 28 feet, was reached, a breastwork of\r\nparapets was constructed on the outer wall; the inner wall was carried\r\nup about 16 feet above the broad passageway on the top (Fig. 110) as a\r\nshield against the weapons of the enemy, preventing the missiles from\r\ngoing over into the town and causing them to fall where the garrison\r\ncould easily pick them up to hurl back again. Rain water falling on\r\nthe top flowed toward the outside, and was carried beyond the face of\r\nthe masonry by stone waterspouts.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 108.--Plan of a section of the city wall.\r\n\r\n     A. Inner wall with buttresses and abutments.\r\n     B. Outer wall.\r\n     C. Filling of earth between the stone walls.\r\n     D. Tower.\r\n     E. Stairs leading to the top of the wall.]\r\n\r\nFor additional strength there was heaped against the inner wall an\r\nembankment of earth, which still remains on the north side, between\r\nthe tenth and twelfth towers. At the right of the Herculaneum Gate the\r\nplace of the embankment and of the inner wall was taken by a massive\r\nstairway (E in Fig. 108) leading to the top. Originally, the stairs\r\nextended east about 270 feet, but afterwards they were demolished for\r\nthe greater part of the distance, and houses were built close to the\r\nwall. There is a smaller stairway of the same kind east of the Stabian\r\nGate (Fig. 111).\r\n\r\nIn the original structure both outer and inner walls were built of\r\nhewn blocks of tufa and limestone; but we find portions of the outer\r\nwall, and all the towers, of lava rubble, the surface of which was\r\ncovered with stucco. The towers were already standing, as shown by\r\ninscriptions, at the time of the Social War. We are therefore safe in\r\nbelieving that in the period of peace following the Second Punic War\r\nthe walls were not kept in repair, some parts of the outer wall being\r\nutilized as a quarry for building stone; that with the advent of the\r\nSocial War they were hastily repaired on the north, east, and south\r\nsides, and strengthened by towers, but that no attempt was made to\r\nrenew the fortifications on the steep southwest side, between the\r\nHerculaneum Gate and the Forum Triangulare, where the line of the old\r\nwall was covered with buildings.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 109.--View of the city wall, inside, where the\r\n   embankment has been removed. The door in the tower at the left marks\r\n   the height of the embankment.]\r\n\r\nWhen the towers were added--probably not long before 90 B.C.--they\r\nwere not distributed evenly along the wall, but were placed where they\r\nseemed to be most needed. The western portion of the ridge between the\r\nHerculaneum and Capua Gates was particularly favorable for the\r\napproach of an enemy; hence three towers were built near together\r\nhere, numbered 10, 11, and 12 on Plan I. Another part of the wall\r\nespecially exposed was on the southeast side, where the height covered\r\nby the city slopes gradually down to the plain; and we find five\r\ntowers within a comparatively short distance, two east of the\r\nAmphitheatre, the other three further south. On the north side,\r\nbetween the Capua and Sarno gates, the slope is steeper and two towers\r\nwere thought to be sufficient.\r\n\r\nThat there were once two additional towers, besides the ten that have\r\nbeen enumerated, is evident from several Oscan inscriptions, painted\r\nin red letters on the street walls of houses. One of them, near the\r\nsouthwest corner of the house of the Faun, reads thus: 'This way leads\r\nbetween Towers 10 and 11, where Titus Fisanius is in command.' The\r\nstreet referred to runs between the tenth and twelfth Insulae of\r\nRegion VI, direct to the city wall. Two others refer to a 'Tower 12'\r\nnear the Herculaneum Gate, this part of the fortifications being in\r\ncharge of Maras Adirius.\r\n\r\nIn a fourth inscription we read: 'This way leads between the houses of\r\nMaras Castricius and of Maras Spurnius, where Vibius Seximbrius is in\r\ncommand.' In 1897, a fifth inscription became visible on the north\r\nside of Insula VIII. v-vi, where it had been concealed by a coat of\r\nplaster: 'This way leads to the city building (and) to Minerva.' The\r\nstreet referred to is seemingly the blind alley which formerly ran\r\nthrough the insula (Plan I). If this is correct, the sanctuary of\r\nMinerva is the Doric temple in the Forum Triangulare; but the 'city\r\nbuilding' cannot be identified.\r\n\r\nThe five inscriptions evidently date from the siege of Sulla; they\r\nwere intended for the information of the soldiers, belonging to the\r\narmy of the Allies, who were quartered in the city to assist in its\r\ndefence. At this time there must have been twelve towers, that near\r\nthe Herculaneum Gate being reckoned last in the enumeration, as in\r\nPlan I; but the location of the two that have disappeared has not been\r\ndetermined. Another suggestive reminder of the same siege is the name\r\nL . SVLA, scratched by a soldier in the stucco on the inside of Tower\r\n10, near a loophole.\r\n\r\nThe towers, which measure approximately 31 by 25 feet, were built in\r\ntwo stories, with strong vaulted ceilings. The floor of the second\r\nstory was on a level with the top of the wall, and over this story was\r\na terrace with battlements, as shown in Fig. 110; the roof seen on the\r\ntwo towers in Fig. 101 was a later addition, made when the city walls\r\nwere no longer needed as a means of defence. Stairways on the inside\r\ngave ready access to the lower part of the towers, which could be\r\nentered from the city by a door (Fig. 109) opening on the embankment.\r\nOn the outside were loopholes. Below, at the right, was a sally port,\r\nplaced thus in order that the soldiers when rushing forth might\r\npresent their shields to the enemy, leaving the right hand free to use\r\nwith offensive weapons; when returning to the wall they would, if\r\npossible, cut their way to the sally port in the next tower to the\r\nright, so as to avoid the danger of exposing their right sides to the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 110.--Tower of the city wall, restored.]\r\n\r\nFour of the gates have been excavated, the Porta Marina and the\r\nStabian, Nola and Herculaneum gates; two others, the Vesuvius and\r\nSarno gates, have been partly exposed to view. The remaining two are\r\nstill completely covered. All bear evidence of extensive repairs, and\r\none of them, the Herculaneum Gate, was entirely rebuilt at a\r\ncomparatively late period; with this exception, however, they seem to\r\nhave assumed their present form in the Tufa Period. Three of them\r\nstill retain traces of decoration of the first style on the inner\r\nparts. The different gateways enter the walls at various angles.\r\n\r\nThe Stabian Gate may be taken as typical. Entering from the outside,\r\nat A, one came through a vaulted passage, B, about twelve feet wide,\r\nto a broad middle passage, or vantage court, open to the sky, into\r\nwhich missiles and boiling pitch could be hurled from above upon the\r\nheads of an enemy attempting to force the gates; then followed a\r\nsecond vaulted passage, a little wider than the other, in which were\r\nhung the heavy double doors, opening outward. The projecting posts of\r\nthe doors are preserved, as are also the stones on which they rested\r\nwhen they were swung back against the wall; the vaulting has been\r\nrestored. The gateway was paved throughout, with a raised walk on the\r\nright side. On one side of the inner entrance is a well (_a_), the\r\nGorgon's head upon the curb reminding one of the protectress of the\r\ngate; on the other, the flight of steps already mentioned (_b_) leads\r\nto the top of the wall. Just beyond the steps are the remains of a\r\nsmall building, perhaps the lodge of the gate keeper (_c_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 111.--Plan of the Stabian Gate.\r\n\r\n     B. Outer passage.\r\n     C. Vantage court.\r\n     D. Doors.\r\n     _a._ Well.\r\n     _b._ Steps leading to the top of the wall.\r\n     _c._ Gatekeeper's lodge.\r\n     _d._ Oscan inscription.\r\n     _e._ Latin inscription.]\r\n\r\nThe patron divinity of city gates, Minerva, was probably honored with\r\na small statue in the niche still to be seen in the wall of the\r\nvantage court. Two inscriptions commemorate the making of repairs on\r\nthe thoroughfare passing under the gateway. One of them (at _d_) is\r\nthe Oscan inscription recording the work of the aediles Sittius and\r\nPontius, to which reference has already been made (p. 184). The other\r\n(at _e_) is in Latin, and of much later date. It informs us that the\r\nduumvirs L. Avianius Flaccus and Q. Spedius Firmus at their own\r\nexpense paved the road 'from the milestone,' which must have been near\r\nthe gate, 'to the station of the gig drivers (_cisiarios_), at the\r\nlimits of the territory of the Pompeians.' The Roman gigs, _cisia_,\r\nwere very light, and adapted for rapid travelling; they were drawn by\r\nhorses or mules, and were kept for hire at stations along the\r\nhighways. The site of the station between Pompeii and Stabiae is not\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nThe Nola Gate, and the partially excavated Vesuvius and Sarno gates,\r\nfollow the plan just described in all essential particulars. The inner\r\nkeystone of the Nola Gate, facing the city, is ornamented with a\r\nhelmeted head of Minerva, in high relief, which being of tufa has\r\nsuffered from exposure to the weather. There was once an Oscan\r\ninscription near by, which stated that the chief executive officer of\r\nthe city, Vibius Popidius, let the contract for building this gate,\r\nand accepted the structure from the contractor.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 112.--Plan of the Herculaneum Gate.\r\n\r\n     A. Steps leading to the top of the city wall.\r\n     B. Room belonging to the house at the left of the Gate.]\r\n\r\nThe front of the Porta Marina has the appearance of a tower projecting\r\nfrom the wall. The gateway consists simply of two vaulted entrances,\r\nof unequal width; one for vehicles, the other, at the left, for\r\npedestrians. Both were closed by doors. In the niche at the right of\r\nthe wider passage the lower part of a terra cotta statue of Minerva\r\nwas found. There was no vantage court, no inner passage; but in the\r\nearly years of the Roman colony the steep lower end of the Via Marina\r\nfor a distance of 70 feet was covered with a vaulted roof, which still\r\nremains. Opening into this corridor on the right is a long narrow\r\nroom, which formed a part of the foundations of the court of the\r\ntemple of Venus Pompeiana, and is now used as a Museum.\r\n\r\nThis gate in its present form could hardly have been intended for\r\ndefence; it was adapted rather for administrative purposes, and must\r\nhave been built--probably in the place of an earlier structure--in a\r\nperiod when the possibility of war seemed remote. Such a time, as\r\npreviously remarked, was the second century B.C., particularly the\r\nlatter half, after the destruction of Carthage.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 113.--Herculaneum Gate, looking down the Street of\r\n   Tombs.\r\n\r\n   The corners of the entrances are opus mixtum, a course of brick-shaped\r\n   blocks of stone alternating with three courses of bricks.]\r\n\r\nA still more peaceful aspect is presented by the Herculaneum Gate. The\r\nstyle of masonry--rubble work with _opus mixtum_ at the\r\ncorners--points to the end of the Republic, rather than to the Empire,\r\nas the period of construction. Here we find three vaulted passages,\r\nthe middle one for vehicles, those on either side for pedestrians. The\r\nvaulting over the middle part of the gate has disappeared; but\r\naccording to appearances a vantage court was left here, in the middle\r\npassage, if not in those at the sides; at the inner end of this court\r\nthe gates were placed. The greater part of the structure served no\r\npurpose of utility; it was obviously designed as a monumental entrance\r\nto the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n_THE POMPEIAN HOUSE_\r\n\r\n\r\nOur chief sources of information regarding the domestic architecture\r\nof ancient Italy are two,--the treatise of Vitruvius, and the remains\r\nfound at Pompeii. The Pompeian houses present many variations from the\r\nplan described by the Roman architect; yet in essential particulars\r\nthere is no disagreement, and it is not difficult to form a clear\r\nconception of their arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe houses of Greco-Roman antiquity differed from those of modern\r\ntimes in several respects. They took their light and air from the\r\ninside, the apartments being grouped about a court or about a large\r\ncentral room which ordinarily had an opening in the ceiling; the\r\ndistribution of space being thus made on a different principle, the\r\nlarge rooms were often larger, the small rooms smaller and more\r\nnumerous than in modern dwellings of corresponding size; and in the\r\nbetter houses the decoration of both walls and floors was more\r\npermanent than is usual in our day. The ancient houses were relatively\r\nlow, in most cases, if we except the crowded tenements of imperial\r\nRome, not exceeding two stories. The windows in the outside walls were\r\ngenerally few and small, and the external appearance was not unlike\r\nthat of Oriental houses of the present time. In the city house the\r\nlarge front entrance was frequently ornamented with carved posts and\r\nlintel.\r\n\r\nThe development of the Italic house can be traced at Pompeii over a\r\nperiod of almost four hundred years. The earlier form consisted of a\r\nsingle series of apartments,--a central room, _atrium_, with smaller\r\nrooms opening into it, and a garden at the rear; an example is the\r\nhouse of the Surgeon (p. 280). A restoration of such a house with its\r\nhigh atrium, wide front door, and garden is shown in Fig. 114.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 114.--Early Pompeian house, restored.]\r\n\r\nLater, under Greek influence, a court with a colonnade and surrounding\r\nrooms was added. This was called _peristylium_, 'peristyle'; it is\r\nsimply the more elaborate inner part of the Greek house, _andronitis_,\r\njoined to the dwelling of Italic origin. We find the union of atrium\r\nand peristyle with their respective groups of apartments fully\r\naccomplished in the second century B.C., the Tufa Period; the type of\r\ndwelling thus developed remained in vogue during Roman times and is\r\noften called the Roman house.\r\n\r\nThe double origin is clearly indicated by the names of the rooms.\r\nThose of the front part are designated by Latin words,--_atrium_,\r\n_fauces_, _ala_, _tablinum_; but the apartments at the rear bear Greek\r\nnames,--_peristylium_, _triclinium_, _oecus_, _exedra_. In large\r\nhouses both atrium and peristyle were sometimes duplicated.\r\n\r\nThe houses of Pompeii impress the visitor as having been designed\r\nprimarily for summer use. The arrangements contemplate the spending of\r\nmuch time in the open air, and pains was taken to furnish protection\r\nfrom the heat, not from the cold. The greater part of the area is\r\ntaken up by colonnades, gardens, and courts; from this point of view\r\nthe atrium may be classed as a court. The living rooms had high\r\nceilings. In summer they were cool and airy, in winter difficult to\r\nheat; they were dark and close when the door was shut, cold when it\r\nwas open.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 115.--Plan of a Pompeian house.]\r\n\r\nWith a single exception the arrangements for heating so often met with\r\nin the remains of houses discovered in northern countries are found at\r\nPompeii only in connection with bath-rooms; the cold was ineffectively\r\ncombated by means of braziers. We are led to believe that the\r\nPompeians were extremely sensitive to heat, but endured cold with\r\ngreat patience. One who makes himself familiar with the arrangements\r\nof Italian houses to-day will receive a similar impression, although\r\nthe peculiarity is perhaps less obvious than in the case of the\r\nancient dwellings.\r\n\r\nIn describing the Pompeian houses it is more convenient to designate\r\nthe principal rooms by the ancient names. In Fig. 115 we present an\r\nideal plan; in it the names are given to the parts of the house, the\r\nrelative location of which is subject to comparatively little\r\nvariation. These parts will first be discussed; then those will be\r\ntaken up which present a greater diversity in their arrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. VESTIBULE, FAUCES, AND FRONT DOOR\r\n\r\nThe _vestibulum_ was the space between the front door and the street.\r\nThe derivation of the word (_ve-_ + the root of _stare_, 'to stand\r\naside') suggests the purpose; the vestibule was a place where one\r\ncould step aside from the bustle and confusion of the street. In many\r\nhouses there was no vestibule, the front door opening directly on the\r\nsidewalk; and where vestibules did exist at Pompeii, they were much\r\nmore modest than those belonging to the houses of wealthy Romans, to\r\nwhich reference is so frequently made in classical writers. Roman\r\nvestibules were often supported by columns of costly marbles, and\r\nadorned with statues and other works of art. Only one vestibule at\r\nPompeii was treated as a portico, that of the house of the Vestals\r\nnear the Herculaneum Gate. This was once as wide as the atrium, the\r\nroof being carried by four columns; but before the destruction of the\r\ncity two partitions were built parallel with the sides dividing it\r\ninto three parts, a narrow vestibule of the ordinary type, with a shop\r\nat the right and at the left.\r\n\r\nThe passage inside the front door was called _fauces_, or _prothyron_.\r\nAccording to Vitruvius the width of it in the case of large atriums\r\nshould be half, in smaller atriums two thirds, that of the tablinum;\r\nat Pompeii the width is generally less than half. In the houses of the\r\nTufa Period the corners of the fauces where it opens into the atrium\r\nwere ornamented with pilasters connected at the top by an entablature.\r\n\r\nThe vestibule and fauces were ordinarily of the same width, and were\r\nseparated by projecting doorposts with a slightly raised threshold\r\n(Fig. 116) and heavy double doors. Sometimes, as in the house of\r\nEpidius Rufus, there was in addition a small door at the side of the\r\nvestibule opening into a narrow passage connecting with the fauces\r\n(Fig. 149). In such cases the folding doors, which on account of their\r\nsize and the method of hanging must always have been hard to open,\r\nwere generally kept shut. They would be thrown back early in the\r\nmorning for the reception of clients, and on special occasions; at\r\nother times the more convenient small door would be used.\r\n\r\nIn several instances the volcanic dust so hardened about the lower\r\npart of a front door that it has been possible to make a cast by\r\npouring soft plaster of Paris into the cavity left by the crumbling\r\naway of the wood; there are several of these casts in the little\r\nMuseum at Pompeii. With their help, and with the well preserved stone\r\nthresholds before us, it is possible to picture to ourselves the\r\nappearance of the doorway.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 116.--Plan and section of the vestibule,\r\n   threshold, and fauces of the house of Pansa.]\r\n\r\nThe doorposts were protected by wooden casings, _antepagmenta_, which\r\nwere made fast at the bottom by means of holes in the threshold\r\n([alpha], [alpha] in Fig. 116).\r\n\r\nThe folding doors swung on pivots, which were fitted into sockets in the\r\nthreshold ([beta], [beta]) and in the lintel. The pivots were of wood,\r\nbut were provided--at least the lower ones--with a cylindrical cap of\r\niron or bronze, and the socket had a protective lining of the same\r\nmetal. Both caps and sockets, especially those of bronze, are found in\r\nthe thresholds in a good state of preservation. It seems strange that\r\nancient builders did not use smaller pivots of solid metal, on which the\r\ndoors would have turned much more easily; but a conservative tradition\r\nin this regard prevailed against innovation.\r\n\r\nThe fastenings were elaborate. Near the inner edge of each door was a\r\nvertical bolt, which shot into a hole in the threshold ([gamma],\r\n[gamma]); there was probably a corresponding bolt at the top, as in\r\nthe case of large modern doors. Sometimes there was a heavy iron lock,\r\nturned with a key, and also an iron bar which was fastened across the\r\ncrack in such a way as to tie the two folds together. In many houses\r\nthere are holes in the walls of the fauces, just back of the door, in\r\nwhich at night a strong wooden bar, _sera_, was placed; hardly less\r\noften we find a hole in the floor a few feet back, in which one end of\r\na slanting prop was set, the other end being braced against the middle\r\nof the door. These arrangements bring to mind Juvenal's vivid picture\r\nof the disturbances and dangers of the streets of Rome at night.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE ATRIUM\r\n\r\nAn atrium completely covered by a roof was extremely rare. With few\r\nexceptions, there was a large rectangular opening over the middle,\r\n_compluvium_, toward which the roof sloped from all sides (Figs. 114,\r\n118). In the floor, directly under the compluvium, was a shallow\r\nbasin, _impluvium_, into which the rain water fell (_h_ in Fig. 118).\r\nThe impluvium had two outlets. One was connected with the cistern; a\r\nround cistern mouth, _puteal_, ornamented with carving, often stood\r\nnear the edge of the basin, as in the house of the Tragic Poet (Fig.\r\n153). The other outlet led under the floor to the street in front,\r\ncarrying off the overflow when the cistern was full, and also the\r\nwater used in cleaning the floor. In the better houses a fountain was\r\noften placed in the middle of the impluvium.\r\n\r\nVitruvius (VI. iii. 1 _et seq._) mentions five kinds of atriums, the\r\nbasis of classification being the construction of the roof--Tuscan,\r\ntetrastyle, Corinthian, displuviate, and tortoise atriums. The first\r\nthree are well illustrated at Pompeii.\r\n\r\nThe Tuscan atrium, supposed by the Romans to have been derived from\r\nthe Etruscans, was apparently the native Italic form. Two heavy\r\ngirders were placed across the room, above the ends of the impluvium\r\n(Fig. 117, _b_). On these, two shorter crossbeams were laid (_c_),\r\nover the sides of the impluvium. The corners of the rectangular frame\r\nthus made were connected with the walls at the corners of the atrium\r\nby four strong slanting beams (Figs. 117, 118, _e_). On these and on\r\nthe frame were placed the lower ends of the sloping rafters (Fig. 117,\r\n_f_), carrying the tiles, the arrangement of which can be seen in\r\nFigs. 114, 117, and 118. This was the most common arrangement of the\r\nroof at Pompeii.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 117.--A Tuscan atrium: plan of the roof.\r\n\r\n     _a_, _a._ Side walls.\r\n     _b._ One of the two girders supporting the roof.\r\n     _c._ Crossbeam, resting on the two girders.\r\n     _d._ Short beam of the thickness of _c_.\r\n     _e._ Corner beam.\r\n     _f._ Rafters, sloping toward the inside.\r\n     _g._ Compluvium.\r\n     1. Flat tiles, _tegulae_.\r\n     2. Semicylindrical tiles for covering the joints, _imbrices_.\r\n     3. Gutter tiles.]\r\n\r\nThe edge of the compluvium was frequently ornamented with terra cotta\r\nwaterspouts, representing the heads of animals. In a house near the\r\nPorta Marina the projecting foreparts of dogs and lions were used in\r\nplace of the heads; the remains of a part of the compluvium have been\r\nput together again, and are seen in Fig. 119. The lions were placed\r\nover the larger spouts at the four corners; the under side of the\r\nspouts surmounted by the dogs and lions was ornamented with acanthus\r\nleaves in relief. The same illustration presents an example of the\r\nantefixes sometimes found.\r\n\r\nThe tetrastyle atrium differed from the Tuscan in only one respect:\r\nthere were four columns supporting the roof, one at each corner of the\r\nimpluvium. In most cases these supports, which interfered with the\r\nview of the interior, can hardly have been intended primarily for\r\nornament; they simplified the construction, making the ceiling and\r\nroof firm without the use of the heavy and expensive girders.\r\n\r\nThe Corinthian atrium had a larger compluvium than the other kinds,\r\nthe roof being supported by a number of columns. There are three\r\nexamples at Pompeii, the houses of Epidius Rufus with sixteen columns\r\n(p. 310), of Castor and Pollux with twelve, and of the Fullonica with\r\nsix.\r\n\r\nThe roof of the displuviate atrium sloped from the middle toward the\r\nsides, the water being carried off by lead pipes. The aperture for the\r\nadmission of light and air was relatively much higher above the floor\r\nthan in the kinds previously described. No example of this type has\r\nbeen found at Pompeii.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 118.--A Tuscan atrium: section.\r\n\r\n     _b._ Girder.\r\n     _e._ Corner rafter.\r\n     _h._ Impluvium.\r\n     1. Flat tiles.\r\n     2. Semicylindrical tiles.]\r\n\r\nThe tortoise atrium, _atrium testudinatum_, was small and without a\r\ncompluvium. The roof had a pyramidal shape. There were possibly a few\r\nexamples at Pompeii, as we may infer from the occasional absence of an\r\nimpluvium; in the only instance, however, in which it is possible to\r\ndetermine the form of the roof (V. v. 1-2), this must have been very\r\ndifferent from that referred to by the Roman writer (p. 343).\r\n\r\nVitruvius says further that the atrium should have an oblong shape,\r\nthe width being three fifths or two thirds of the length, or measured\r\non the side of a square, the hypothenuse of which is taken for the\r\nlength. The design was obviously to bring the sides nearer together,\r\nthus lessening the strain on the two girders which in the commonest\r\nform were used to sustain the roof. The height, to the frame of the\r\ncompluvium, should be three fourths of the width.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the tetrastyle and Corinthian atriums at Pompeii the\r\nheight is indicated by that of the columns, but there are rarely\r\nadequate data for determining the height of the others with exactness.\r\nIn regard to length and breadth the proportions harmonize fairly well\r\nwith those recommended by Vitruvius; but the height, in the cases in\r\nwhich it can be ascertained, is often greater than that contemplated\r\nby the rules of the architect.\r\n\r\nLooking at the Pompeian atriums in their present condition (Plate VII,\r\nFigs. 121, 153) one might easily receive the impression that they were\r\nprimarily courts rather than rooms. In this respect the restorations\r\nof Roman houses in the older books are often at fault, the atrium\r\nbeing generally represented as too low in comparison with the rooms\r\naround it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 119.--Corner of a compluvium with waterspouts and\r\n   antefixes, reconstructed.]\r\n\r\nThe references in the ancient writers uniformly point to this as the\r\nprincipal room of the house. In the earliest times the hearth stood\r\nhere; a hole in the roof served as a chimney. The accumulation of soot\r\non the ceiling and the walls suggested the characteristic name 'black\r\nroom'; for _atrium_ comes from _ater_, 'black.' Here the household\r\ngathered at mealtime; here they worked, or rested from their labors.\r\nIn the atrium Lucretia sat with her maids spinning late at night when\r\nher husband entered unexpectedly with his friends.\r\n\r\nSuch the atrium remained in farmhouses to the latest times. The name\r\nmeanwhile was transferred to the corresponding apartment of elegant\r\ncity homes, while in the country it went out of use, being replaced by\r\n_culina_, 'kitchen,' on account of the presence of the hearth. In\r\nsuch a room in his Sabine villa Horace loved to dine, conversing on\r\ntopics grave or gay with his rustic neighbors, and partaking of the\r\nsimple fare with relish; while his slaves, freed from the restraints\r\nof city life, were permitted to eat at the same time, sitting at a\r\nseparate table. The remains of an atrium of this kind, with its hearth\r\nand niche for the images of the household gods, may be seen in the\r\nvilla recently excavated near Boscoreale (p. 361).\r\n\r\nWithout doubt some houses of the ancient type might be found in\r\ncities, even in Rome, as late as the end of the Republic. We read of\r\none in Cicero's time in the atrium of which spinning was done. But at\r\nPompeii the hearth had been banished from the atrium at a\r\ncomparatively early date, in the Tufa Period if not before; and the\r\nroom was made uncomfortable to sit in, for a considerable part of the\r\nyear, by the broad opening of the compluvium.\r\n\r\nFrom the architectural point of view, however, the atrium never lost\r\nits significance as the central apartment. In all its dimensions, but\r\nparticularly in height, it presents so great a contrast with the rooms\r\naround it as to remind us of the relation of a Roman Catholic church\r\nto the chapels at the sides. The impression of spaciousness was\r\nperhaps deepened when the atrium was provided with a ceiling. Few\r\ntraces of such ceilings are found at Pompeii, and in the smaller\r\nhouses the inside of the roof seems generally to have been visible.\r\n\r\nThe atrium of the Corinthian type most nearly resembled a court, on\r\naccount of the size of the opening to the sky and the use of many\r\ncolumns. A suggestion of the un-Italic character of this type appears\r\nin the name; for one can scarcely suppose that atriums in the strict\r\nsense existed at Corinth.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Pompeian atriums show no traces of a hearth, there is\r\npossibly a reminiscence of the ancient arrangement in the\r\n_gartibulum_, a table which we frequently find at the rear of the\r\nimpluvium. Varro says that since his boyhood these tables, on which\r\nvessels of bronze were placed, had gone out of use; at Pompeii they\r\nremained in fashion much longer. The gartibulum with its bronze vases\r\nmay symbolize the ancient hearth with the cooking utensils. Possibly,\r\nhowever, it represents the kitchen table near the hearth on which the\r\ndishes were washed; that it may have served a similar purpose in later\r\ntimes is evident from the fact that in front of it a marble pedestal\r\nwas often placed for a statuette which threw a jet of water into a\r\nmarble basin at the edge of the impluvium. This group of table,\r\nfountain figure, and basin appears in many Pompeian atriums. In Plate\r\nVII we see the gartibulum and the supports of the marble-basin, but\r\nthe base of the fountain figure has disappeared.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 120.--A Pompeian's strong box, _arca_.]\r\n\r\nThe strong box of the master of the house, _arca_, often stood in the\r\natrium, usually against one of the side walls. It was sometimes\r\nadorned with reliefs, as the one shown in Fig. 120, which is now in\r\nthe Naples Museum. It stood on a heavy block of stone, or low\r\nfoundation of masonry, to which it was attached by an iron rod passing\r\ndown through the bottom. A wealthy Pompeian sometimes had more than\r\none of these chests.\r\n\r\nIn three atriums the herm of the proprietor stands at the rear. One,\r\nwith the portrait of Cornelius Rufus, is shown in Fig. 121.\r\n\r\nWhen there were two atriums in a house, the larger was more\r\nelaborately furnished than the other, and was set aside for the public\r\nor official life of the proprietor; the smaller one was used for\r\ndomestic purposes. Typical examples are found in the houses of the\r\nFaun and of the Labyrinth. In the former the principal atrium is of\r\nthe Tuscan type, the other tetrastyle; in the latter the large atrium\r\nis tetrastyle, the smaller Tuscan.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE TABLINUM\r\n\r\nThe tablinum was a large room at the rear of the atrium, opening into\r\nthe latter with its whole width; the connection of the two rooms is\r\nclearly shown in Plate VII and Fig. 121. According to Vitruvius, when\r\nthe atrium was 30 to 40 feet in width--as in the larger Pompeian\r\nhouses--the tablinum should be half as wide; when the atrium was\r\nsmaller, the width of the tablinum should be two thirds that of the\r\natrium, while the height at the entrance should be nine eighths, and\r\ninside four thirds of the width. These proportions will not hold good\r\nfor Pompeii, where the tablinum is generally narrower and higher\r\n(Vitr. VI. iv. 5, 6).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 121.--Atrium of the house of Cornelius Rufus,\r\n   looking through the tablinum and andron into the peristyle.\r\n\r\n   In the foreground, the impluvium, with the carved supports of a\r\n   marble table; at the left, between the entrances to the andron and\r\n   the tablinum, the herm of Rufus.]\r\n\r\nThe posts at the entrance were usually treated as pilasters, joined\r\nabove by a cornice; architecturally the front of this room formed the\r\nmost impressive feature of the atrium. Between the pilasters hung\r\nportieres, which might be drawn back and fastened at the sides. In the\r\nhouse of the Silver Wedding the fastenings were found in\r\nplace,--bronze disks from which a ship's beak projected, attached to\r\nthe pilasters.\r\n\r\nIn early times the tablinum ordinarily had an opening at the rear\r\nalso, but this was not so high as that in front, and could be closed\r\nby broad folding doors. In winter the doors were probably kept shut.\r\nIn summer they were left open and the room, cool and airy, served as a\r\ndining room, a use which harmonizes well with a passage of Varro\r\nexplaining the derivation of the name. \"In the olden time,\" says this\r\nwriter, \"people used to take their meals in the winter by the hearth;\r\nin summer they ate out of doors, country folk in the court, city\r\npeople in the _tabulinum_, which we understand to have been a summer\r\nhouse built of boards.\" The derivation of _tabulinum_, of which\r\n_tablinum_ is a shortened form, from _tabula_, 'a board,' is obvious.\r\n\r\nThe period to which Varro refers antedates that of the oldest houses\r\nat Pompeii. The room which we call tablinum was then a deep recess at\r\nthe rear of the atrium, open at the front, as now, but enclosed by a\r\nwall at the rear; against this wall was a veranda opening into the\r\ngarden, toward which the board roof sloped. People took their meals in\r\nthe veranda in summer, and to it the name tablinum was naturally\r\napplied. In the recess at the rear of the atrium, corresponding to the\r\nlater tablinum, was the bed of the master of the house, called _lectus\r\nadversus_ because 'facing' one who entered the front door. As late as\r\nthe reign of Augustus, long after it became the custom to set aside a\r\nclosed apartment for the family room, a reminiscence of the ancient\r\narrangement still remained in the couch which stood at the rear of the\r\natrium or in the tablinum, which was called _lectus adversus_, or even\r\n_lectus genialis_.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the hearth and the bed from the atrium must have taken\r\nplace when the small hole in the roof was replaced by the compluvium.\r\nA broad opening was made in the rear wall, and the place where the bed\r\nhad been was turned into a light, airy room; this was now used as a\r\nsummer room instead of the veranda, the name of which was in\r\nconsequence transferred to it.\r\n\r\nEven in later times, when the houses were extended by the addition, at\r\nthe rear, of a peristyle with its group of apartments, the tablinum\r\nmay often have been used as a summer dining room; but the tendency now\r\nwas to withdraw the family life into the more secluded rooms about\r\nthe peristyle. The tablinum, lying between the front and the rear of\r\nthe house, was used as a reception room for guests who were not\r\nadmitted into the privacy of the home; and here undoubtedly the master\r\nof the house received his clients.\r\n\r\nIn the house of the Vettii the tablinum is omitted on account of the\r\nabundance of room; but at the rear of the atrium there are wide\r\nopenings into the peristyle (Fig. 158).\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE ALAE\r\n\r\nThe alae, the 'wings' of the atrium, were two deep recesses in the\r\nsides (Fig. 115). They were ordinarily at the rear, but were sometimes\r\nplaced at the middle, as in the house of Epidius Rufus (Fig. 149).\r\nVitruvius (VI. iv. 4) says that where the atrium is from 30 to 40 feet\r\nlong, one third of the length should be taken for the breadth of the\r\nalae; in the case of larger atriums the breadth of these rooms should\r\nbe proportionally less, being fixed at one fifth of the length for\r\natriums from 80 to 100 feet long; the height at the entrance should be\r\nequal to the breadth.\r\n\r\nAt Pompeii the alae, as the tablinum, are narrower and higher than\r\nrequired by these proportions. In the Tufa Period the entrances were\r\nornamented with pilasters, and treated like the broad entrance of the\r\ntablinum.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the purpose and uses of these rooms we have no\r\ninformation beyond a remark of Vitruvius in regard to placing the\r\nimages of ancestors in them. This throws no light upon their origin;\r\nfor only a few noble families could have possessed a sufficiently\r\nlarge number of ancestral busts or masks to make it necessary to\r\nprovide a special place for these, while the alae form an essential\r\nand characteristic part of the Pompeian house. Now and then an ala was\r\nused as a dining room; more frequently, perhaps, one was utilized for\r\na wardrobe, as may be seen from the traces of the woodwork. A careful\r\nstudy of the remains only deepens the impression that at Pompeii the\r\nalae served no definite purpose, but were a survival from a previous\r\nperiod, in which they responded to different conditions of life.\r\n\r\nAn interesting parallel presents itself in the arrangements of a type\r\nof peasants' house found in Lower Saxony. The main entrance, as in the\r\nearly Italic house, leads into a large and high central room; at the\r\nsides of this and of the main entrance are the living rooms and\r\nstalls. At the back the central room is widened by two recesses\r\ncorresponding with the alae; the hearth stands against the rear wall.\r\nIn the side walls, at the rear of each recess, are a window and a\r\ndoor. The two windows admit light to the part of the central room\r\nfurthest from the entrance; the doors open into the farmyard and the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nThe Italic house in the beginning was not a city residence shut in by\r\nparty walls, but the isolated habitation of a countryman. The design\r\nof the alae, as of the recesses in the Low Saxon farmhouse, was to\r\nfurnish light to the atrium, which, as we have seen, was completely\r\ncovered by a roof, there being only a small hole to let out the smoke.\r\nThe large windows in the rear of the alae of the house of Sallust may\r\nbe looked upon as a survival; but in city houses generally light could\r\nnot be taken in this way from the sides. After the compluvium had come\r\ninto general use, a conservative tradition still retained the alae\r\nwhenever possible, though they no longer answered their original\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE ROOMS ABOUT THE ATRIUM. THE ANDRON\r\n\r\nIn front there were rooms at either side of the entrance, ordinarily\r\nfitted up as shops and opening on the street, but sometimes used as\r\ndining rooms or sleeping rooms, or for other domestic purposes.\r\n\r\nOn each side of the atrium were two or three small sleeping rooms; in\r\nnarrow houses these, as well as one or both of the alae, were\r\noccasionally omitted.\r\n\r\nAt the rear were one or two rooms of the same depth as the tablinum,\r\nused in most cases as dining rooms. They frequently had a single broad\r\nentrance on the side of the peristyle or the garden (Fig. 134, 22),\r\nbut were sometimes entered by a door from the atrium or from one of\r\nthe alae (Figs. 115, 121). The door on the side of the atrium seems\r\ngenerally to have been made when the house was built; if the owner\r\ndid not wish to use it, it was walled up and treated as a blind door,\r\nan ornament of the atrium.\r\n\r\nThe rooms about the atrium in the pre-Roman period were made high,\r\nthose in front and at the sides often measuring fifteen feet to the\r\nedge of the ceiling, which had the form of a groined vault. The rear\r\nrooms were still higher, the crown of the vaults being as far above\r\nthe floor as the flat ceiling of the tablinum. A corresponding height\r\nwas given to the doors; those in the house of the Faun measure nearly\r\nfourteen feet. The upper part of the doorway was doubtless pierced for\r\nthe admission of light in the manner indicated by wall paintings, and\r\nshown in our restoration of one side of the atrium in the house of\r\nSallust (Figs. 261, 262).\r\n\r\nThe andron was a passage at the right or the left of the tablinum,\r\nconnecting the atrium with the peristyle (Figs. 115, 121). The name\r\nwas used originally to designate an apartment in the Greek house, but\r\nwas applied by the Romans to a corridor. In modern times the passage\r\nhas often been erroneously called fauces.\r\n\r\nThe andron is lacking only in small houses, or in those in which a\r\ndifferent connection is made between the front and rear portions by\r\nmeans of a second atrium, or other rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. GARDEN, PERISTYLE, AND ROOMS ABOUT THE PERISTYLE\r\n\r\nA few Pompeian houses, like those of the olden time, are without a\r\nperistyle, having a garden at the rear. In such cases there is a\r\ncolonnade at the back of the house, facing the garden; this is the\r\narrangement in the houses of the Surgeon, of Sallust, and of Epidius\r\nRufus. In the large house of Pansa (Fig. 179), we find both a\r\nperistyle and a garden, the latter being at the rear of the peristyle;\r\nand in many houses a small garden was placed wherever available space\r\ncould be found.\r\n\r\nThe peristyle is a garden enclosed by a colonnade, or having a\r\ncolonnade on two or three sides. When this was higher on the north\r\nside than on the other three, as in the house of the Silver Wedding,\r\nthe peristyle was called Rhodian. In the Tufa Period the colonnade\r\nwas frequently in two stories, on all four sides or on the front\r\nalone. Fragments of columns belonging to the second story have been\r\nfound in many houses, but in only one instance, that of the house of\r\nthe Centenary, are they of such a character as to enable us to make an\r\naccurate restoration; here the double series of columns extended only\r\nacross the front.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE VII.--INTERIOR OF A HOUSE, LOOKING FROM THE\r\n   MIDDLE OF THE ATRIUM TOWARD THE REAR]\r\n\r\nA separate entrance, _posticum_ (Fig. 115), usually connected the\r\nperistyle with a side street. At the rear there was often a broad,\r\ndeep recess, _exedra_, corresponding with the tablinum. The location\r\nof the other rooms in this part of the house is determined by so many\r\nconditions, and manifests so great a diversity that it may be spoken\r\nof more conveniently in connection with their use.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. SLEEPING ROOMS\r\n\r\nThe small, high rooms about the atrium were in the earlier times used\r\nas bedrooms; and such they remained in some houses, as that of the\r\nFaun, down to the destruction of the city.\r\n\r\nThe sleeping rooms about the peristyle were much lower, and the front\r\nopened by means of a broad door in its whole, or almost its whole,\r\nwidth upon the colonnade. These rooms could frequently be entered also\r\nthrough a small side door from a dining room, or a narrow recess\r\nopening on the peristyle (Fig. 146, _x_). The design of the\r\narrangement is obvious. In summer the inconvenient large door could be\r\nleft open day and night, a curtain being stretched across the space;\r\nin winter it would be opened only for airing and cleaning, the small\r\ndoor being used at other times.\r\n\r\nThe place for the bed was sometimes indicated in the plan of the room.\r\nIn a bedroom of the house of the Centaur, of which an end view is\r\ngiven in Fig. 122, a narrow alcove was made for the bed at the left\r\nside; the floor of the alcove is slightly raised, and the ceiling, as\r\noften, is in the form of a vault, while the ceiling of the room is\r\nhigher and only slightly arched. A similar arrangement is found in\r\nseveral other rooms decorated in the first style. In several houses,\r\nas in the house of Apollo, there is a sleeping room with alcoves for\r\ntwo beds.\r\n\r\nIn bedrooms with a mosaic floor the place for the bed is ordinarily\r\nwhite, being separated from the rest of the room by a stripe\r\nsuggestive of a threshold. A similar division is often indicated in\r\nthe wall decoration, particularly that of the second style; the part\r\ndesignated for the bed is set off by pilasters on the end walls, and\r\ndifferently treated both in respect to the decorative design and in\r\nthe arrangement of colors.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 122.--End of a bedroom in the house of the\r\n   Centaur, decorated in the first style. At the left, alcove for the\r\n   bed; above, two windows.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. DINING ROOMS\r\n\r\nAs long as it was customary to sit at meals any fair-sized apartment\r\ncould be used as a dining room. When the early Italic house was\r\nextended by the addition of a peristyle, and the Greek custom of\r\nreclining at table was introduced, it became necessary to provide a\r\nspecial apartment, and the Greek name for such a room with the three\r\ncouches, _triclinium_, came into use. For convenience in serving, the\r\nlength of a dining room, according to Vitruvius, should be twice the\r\nwidth. At Pompeii, however, the dimensions are less generous; with an\r\naverage width of 12 or 13 feet the length rarely exceeds 20 feet. In\r\nmany cases one end of the room opened on the peristyle, but could be\r\nclosed by means of broad doors or shutters.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 123.--Plan of a dining room with three couches.\r\n\r\n     A. Upper couch, _lectus summus_.\r\n     B. Middle couch, _lectus medius_.\r\n     C. Lower couch, _lectus imus_.\r\n     D. Table, _mensa_.]\r\n\r\nThe plan of a typical dining room is given in Fig. 123. The couch at\r\nthe right of the table was called the upper couch; that at the left,\r\nthe lower; and that between, the middle couch. With few exceptions\r\neach couch was made to accommodate three persons; the diner rested on\r\nhis left arm on a cushion at the side nearer the table, and stretched\r\nhis feet out toward the right. Hence, the first on the upper couch had\r\nwhat was called 'the highest place.' The one next was said to recline\r\n'below' him, because lying on the side toward which the first person\r\nextended his feet; the man at the outer end of the lower couch was\r\nsaid to be 'at the foot,' _imus_. When in the Gospel of John we read\r\nof a disciple \"lying on Jesus' breast,\" the meaning is easily\r\nexplained by reference to Roman usage; John was reclining in the place\r\nnext below the Master. This arrangement makes clear to us the reason\r\nwhy the couches were so placed that the lower one projected further\r\nbeyond the table than the upper one; the feet of those on the lower\r\ncouch were extended toward the end furthest from the table.\r\n\r\nTo the couches grouped in the manner indicated the same name was\r\napplied as to the dining room, triclinium. Of those in the dining\r\nrooms only scanty remains are found. In summer the Pompeians, as the\r\nItalians of to-day, were fond of dining in the open air. In order to\r\nsave the trouble of moving heavy furniture couches of masonry were not\r\ninfrequently constructed in the garden, and have been preserved; such\r\na triclinium is that in the garden of the tannery (p. 398). The\r\narrangement is in most cases precisely that indicated in Fig. 123, the\r\nouter end of the lower couch projecting beyond the corresponding end\r\nof the upper one. In the middle stands the base of the table, also of\r\nmasonry; the top is rarely preserved. Near by is a little altar for\r\nthe offerings made in connection with each meal. The appearance of\r\nsuch a triclinium may be inferred from that of the triclinium funebre\r\nshown in Fig. 245, which has a square table and round altar.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 124.--Plan of a dining room with an anteroom\r\n   containing an altar for libations.\r\n\r\n     A. Room for the table and couches.\r\n     B. Anteroom with altar.]\r\n\r\nIn many gardens we find about the triclinium the remains of four or\r\nsix columns. These supported a frame of timber or lattice-work, upon\r\nwhich vines were trained, making a shady bower, as in the garden of\r\nthe tavern in the first Region, referred to below (p. 404).\r\n\r\nThe couches were ordinarily not provided with backs, but the outer\r\nends of the upper and lower couches sometimes had a frame to hold the\r\ncushions, as indicated in Fig. 123 and shown more clearly in our\r\nrestoration, Fig. 188. In the dining rooms small movable altars must\r\nhave been used for the offerings, such as those of terra cotta or\r\nbronze not infrequently met with in the course of excavation. A fixed\r\naltar has been found in only one instance, in a small dining room in\r\nthe eighth Region (VIII. v-vi. 16). Here, as our plan (Fig. 124)\r\nshows, the front of the apartment is set off as an anteroom, and in\r\nthis was placed an altar of tufa.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with an ancient custom the children, even those of the\r\nimperial family, sat on low stools at a table of their own on the open\r\nside of the large table. In an open-air triclinium in the ninth Region\r\n(IX. v. 11) the children's seat is preserved, a low bench of masonry\r\nabout forty inches long connected with the projecting arm of the lower\r\ncouch (Plate VII.).\r\n\r\nThe inner part of the dining room, designed for the table and couches,\r\nwas often distinguished from the free space in the same way that the\r\nplace for the bed was indicated in bedrooms, sometimes by a difference\r\nin the design of the mosaic floor, more frequently by the division of\r\nthe wall decoration and the arrangement of the ceiling. In the third\r\nand fourth decorative styles the division is less plainly marked than\r\nin the second; but often the side walls back of the couches and the\r\ninner end of the room have each a single large panel with a small\r\npanel at the right and left, while on each side wall in front are only\r\ntwo panels, of the same size.\r\n\r\nIn one respect the ordinary dining room was far from convenient; those\r\nwho had the inner places could not leave the table or return to it in\r\nthe course of a meal without disturbing one or more of those reclining\r\nnearer the outside. Large rooms, in which an open space was left\r\nbetween the couches and the wall, or in which several tables with\r\ntheir sets of couches could be placed, were unknown in pre-Roman\r\nPompeii. In the time of the Empire a few of these large dining rooms\r\nwere built in older houses. There is one measuring about 25 by 33 feet\r\nin the house of Pansa; another, of which the dimensions are 23 by 30\r\nfeet, in the house of Castor and Pollux; and a third, 36 feet long, in\r\nthe house of the Citharist.\r\n\r\nIn a number of houses we find a large, fine apartment--designated by\r\nthe Greek word _oecus_--which seems often to have been used for a\r\ndining room, especially on notable occasions. A particularly elegant\r\nform was the Corinthian oecus, which had a row of columns about the\r\nsides a short distance from the walls, the room being thus divided\r\ninto a main part with a vaulted ceiling and a corridor with a flat\r\nceiling. The couches would be placed in the main part; the guests\r\ncould pass to their places along the corridor, behind the columns. The\r\nremains of such an oecus may be seen in the houses of Meleager and of\r\nthe Labyrinth.\r\n\r\nA specially interesting example--unfortunately not yet wholly\r\nexcavated--is in the house of the Silver Wedding. In this case only\r\nthe inner part, designed for the couches, is set off by columns. We\r\nmay assume that there was a vaulted ceiling over the middle, resting\r\non the entablature of the columns; that the ceiling of the corridor\r\nbetween the columns and the wall was flat, and of the same height as\r\nthe entablature; and that the front part of the room had a flat or\r\nslightly arched ceiling of the same height as the crown of the vault\r\nover the middle.\r\n\r\nIn the more pretentious Roman houses there was sometimes a dining room\r\nfor each season of the year; when Trimalchio in Petronius's novel\r\nboasts that he has four dining rooms, we are to understand that he had\r\none each for winter, summer, autumn, and spring. In the case of the\r\nPompeian houses we are warranted in assuming that dining rooms opening\r\ntoward the south were for winter use, those toward the north for use\r\nin summer. Other airy apartments, with a large window in addition to\r\nthe wide door, may well have been intended for summer triclinia.\r\nFurther than this it is hardly possible to classify Pompeian dining\r\nrooms according to the seasons.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. THE KITCHEN, THE BATH, AND THE STOREROOMS\r\n\r\nIn the Pompeian house the kitchen had no fixed location. It was\r\ngenerally a small room, and was placed wherever it would least\r\ninterfere with the arrangement of the rest of the house.\r\n\r\nThe most important part of the kitchen was the hearth. This was built\r\nof masonry, against one of the walls. It was oblong, and the fire was\r\nmade on the top. The cooking utensils sometimes rested on rectangular\r\nprojections of masonry, as in the kitchen of the house of Pansa,\r\nsometimes on small iron tripods, as in the house of the Vettii (Fig.\r\n125). The hearth of the latter house was found undisturbed, with a\r\nvessel in place ready to be heated. In one house the place of an iron\r\ntripod was taken by three pointed ends of amphorae set upright on the\r\nhearth. Underneath there was often a hollow place, like that shown in\r\nour illustration, in which fuel was kept, as in similar openings under\r\nthe hearths of Campanian kitchens to-day.\r\n\r\nSometimes we find near the hearth a bake oven, not large enough to\r\nhave been used for bread, and evidently intended for pastry; bread\r\nmust ordinarily have been obtained from the bakers. In one of the\r\ncellars of the house of the Centenary there is a larger oven, which\r\nmay have been used to bake coarse bread for the slaves; the heat was\r\nutilized in warming a bath above.\r\n\r\nOver the hearth was a small window to carry off the smoke. As the\r\nkitchen was ordinarily high there may have been a hole in the roof\r\nalso, but the upper parts have been destroyed, and their arrangement\r\ncannot be determined. From the small size of the kitchens and of the\r\nhearths in even the largest and finest houses, we may infer that the\r\nluxury of the table prevalent in the Early Empire had made only slight\r\nprogress at Pompeii.\r\n\r\nClose by the kitchen, frequently forming a part of it and next to the\r\nhearth, was the closet; a separate closet of good size is found in the\r\nhouses of the Faun and of Castor and Pollux.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 125.--Hearth of the kitchen in the house of the\r\n   Vettii. The arched place underneath is for the storage of fuel.]\r\n\r\nIn many large houses there is a bath, generally too small to have been\r\nused by more than one person at a time. These baths ordinarily include\r\nonly a tepidarium and a caldarium, but occasionally there is an\r\napodyterium, less frequently still a small frigidarium; in most cases\r\na basin in the apodyterium or tepidarium must have been used for the\r\ncold bath. The heating arrangements are similar to those found in the\r\npublic baths, and more or less complete according to the period in\r\nwhich the bath was fitted up, and the taste of the proprietor; a\r\nprogressive refinement in the appointments of the private baths can be\r\ntraced similar to that which we have already noted in the case of the\r\nStabian Baths. The close relation generally existing between the\r\nbath-rooms and the kitchen is well illustrated in the houses of the\r\nFaun and of the Silver Wedding.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this group of rooms we may mention the storerooms,\r\nwhich are found in various parts of the houses and may be identified\r\nby the traces of the shelves that were fastened to the walls.\r\n\r\nComparatively few houses were provided with cellars. In the house of\r\nthe Centenary, however, there are two. One, entered from the atrium by\r\na stairway, extends under the tablinum and the front colonnade of the\r\nperistyle; the other is accessible from a side atrium and is divided\r\ninto several rooms, in one of which is the oven mentioned above. The\r\ncellar belonging to the house of Caecilius Jucundus is under the\r\ngarden; that of the villa of Diomedes will be described later.\r\n\r\n\r\nX. THE SHRINE OF THE HOUSEHOLD GODS\r\n\r\nIn ancient Italy each household worshipped its guardian spirits and\r\ntutelary divinities, which formed a triple group, the Lares, the\r\nPenates, and the Genius. In Pompeii the remains associated with\r\ndomestic worship are numerous and important.\r\n\r\nMany Pompeians painted representations of the household gods upon an\r\ninner wall, often upon a wall of the kitchen, near the hearth. There\r\nwas usually a painted altar underneath, with a serpent on either side\r\ncoming to partake of the offerings.\r\n\r\nIn a large number of houses a small niche was made in the wall, in\r\nwhich were placed little images of the gods, the Lares and the Genius\r\nbeing also painted on the back of the cavity or on the wall at the\r\nsides or below. Such a niche may be seen in a corner of the kitchen in\r\nthe house of Apollo (Fig. 126); the pictures of the gods are almost\r\nobliterated, but that of the serpent--in this case there is but\r\none--and of the altar can be clearly seen. In front is a small altar\r\nof masonry; the ferns and grasses with which the floor is carpeted\r\nmake this kitchen in summer an attractive nook. Sometimes the niches\r\nwere ornamented with diminutive half-columns or pilasters at the sides\r\nand a pediment above.\r\n\r\nFrequently a more elaborate shrine was provided, a diminutive temple\r\nraised on a foundation, placed against a wall of the atrium or of the\r\ngarden. An example is the one at the rear of the peristyle in the\r\nhouse of the Tragic Poet (Fig. 153).\r\n\r\nIn rare instances a small, separate chapel was devoted to the domestic\r\nworship, as in the house of the Centenary. In a house of the ninth\r\nRegion (IX. viii. 7) there is such a chapel in the garden, a niche for\r\nthe images being placed in the wall.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 126.--Niche for the images of the household gods,\r\n   in a corner of the kitchen in the house of Apollo.\r\n\r\n   Underneath, a painted serpent represented as about to take offerings\r\n   from a round altar. In front is a square altar for the domestic\r\n   worship.]\r\n\r\nThe Lares are the guardian spirits of the household. Originally but\r\none was worshipped in each house; they began to be honored in\r\nplurality after the time of Cicero, and at Pompeii we invariably find\r\nthem in pairs. They are represented as youths clad in a short tunic\r\nconfined by a girdle (Fig. 127), stepping lightly or dancing, with one\r\nhand high uplifted in which a drinking horn, _rhyton_, is seen; from\r\nthe end of the horn a jet of wine spurts in a graceful curve, falling\r\ninto a small pail, _situla_, or into a libation saucer, _patera_, held\r\nin the other hand.\r\n\r\nSimple offerings were made to these beneficent spirits,--fruits,\r\nsacrificial cakes, garlands, and incense,--and at every meal a portion\r\nwas set aside for them in little dishes. When a sacrifice was offered\r\nto the Lares, the victim was a pig.\r\n\r\nWith the worship of the Lares was associated that of the Genius, the\r\ntutelary divinity of the master of the house. He is represented as a\r\nstanding figure, the face being a portrait of the master. The toga is\r\ndrawn over his head, after the manner of one sacrificing; in the left\r\nhand there is usually a cornucopia, sometimes a box of incense,\r\n_acerra_; with the right hand he pours a drink offering from a patera.\r\n\r\nVery rarely we find a representation of the Genius of the mistress of\r\nthe house. In one painting she appears with the attributes of Juno;\r\nthe Genius of a woman was often called Juno, as in the inscription on\r\nthe bust stone of Tyche, the slave of Julia Augusta (p. 418). As a man\r\nmight swear in the name of his Genius, so a woman's oath might be 'By\r\nmy Juno.'\r\n\r\nThe Lares and the Genius are often found together both in the hearth\r\npaintings, and in the groups of little bronze images frequently placed\r\nin the shrines. They are associated also in an inscription on the\r\nshrine in the house of Epidius Rufus: _Genio M[arci] n[ostri] et\r\nLaribus duo Diadumeni liberti_,--'To the Genius of our Marcus and the\r\nLares; (dedicated by) his two freedmen with the name of Diadumenus.'\r\nMarcus was the first name of the head of the household.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases the Genius of the emperor seems to have been revered at\r\na house shrine. Horace (Od. IV. v. 34) speaks distinctly of the\r\nworship of the tutelary divinity of Augustus in connection with that\r\nof the Lares,--_et Laribus tuum Miscet numen_. On the rear wall of a\r\nlittle chapel in a garden is a painted altar at the right of which\r\nstands Jupiter, at the left a Genius, each pouring a libation. We can\r\nscarcely believe that the Genius of an ordinary man would thus be\r\nplaced as it were on an equality with the ruler of heaven; more likely\r\nthe Genius of an emperor is represented, perhaps that of Claudius. The\r\nface is not unlike the face of Claudius, and the painting is on a wall\r\ndecorated in the third style (Ins. VII. xi. 4).\r\n\r\nIn another house (IX. viii. 13) two Genii are painted, and under one\r\nof them is scratched in large letters _EX SC_, undoubtedly for _ex\r\nsenatus consulto_,--'in accordance with a decree of the Senate.' We\r\nare probably safe in assuming that the decree referred to is that of\r\nthe reign of Augustus, by which the worship of the Lares was regulated\r\n(Dio Cass. LI. xix. 7); if so, the figure is intended to represent the\r\nGenius of that emperor.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 127.--Shrine in the house of Vettii.\r\n\r\n   In the middle the Genius, with libation saucer and box of incense; at\r\n   the sides, the two Lares, each with a drinking horn and pail; below, a\r\n   crested serpent about to partake of the offerings.]\r\n\r\nThe face of the Genius in the house of the Vettii (Fig. 127) bears a\r\ndecided resemblance to that of Nero. Here the shrine was placed in the\r\nrear wall of the smaller atrium. It consists of a broad, shallow\r\nniche, the front of which is elaborately ornamented to give the\r\nappearance of a little temple, while on the back are painted the\r\nhousehold divinities. The Genius stands with veiled head between the\r\ntwo Lares, holding in his left hand a box of incense and pouring a\r\nlibation with the right. In the original painting the features were\r\nunusually distinct.\r\n\r\nThe Penates were the protecting divinities of the provisions or\r\nstores, _penus_, and the storerooms of the house; under this name were\r\nincluded various gods to whom the master and the household offered\r\nspecial worship. At Pompeii the Penates, as the Lares and the Genius,\r\nappear in paintings, and are also represented by bronze images placed\r\nin the shrines. In the shrine of the house of Lucretius were\r\ndiminutive bronze figures of the Genius and of Jupiter, Hercules,\r\nFortuna, and another divinity that has not been identified. Statuettes\r\nof Apollo, Aesculapius, Hercules, and Mercury were found, together\r\nwith those of the two Lares, in another house; in a third, Fortuna\r\nalone with the Lares.\r\n\r\nJupiter and Fortuna are frequently met with in shrine paintings, as\r\nwell as Venus Pompeiana (Fig. 4), Hercules, Mars, and Vulcan as a\r\npersonification of the hearth fire; Vesta, the patron goddess of\r\nbakers, usually appears in the hearth paintings of bake shops.\r\n\r\nUnderneath the representations of the Lares and Penates ordinarily are\r\npainted two serpents, one on either side of an altar, which they are\r\napproaching in order to partake of the offerings; these consist of\r\nfruits, in the midst of which an egg or a pine cone can usually be\r\ndistinguished. As early as the beginning of the Empire the\r\nsignificance of the serpent in the Roman worship had ceased to be\r\nclearly understood; Virgil represents Aeneas as in doubt whether the\r\nserpent which came out from the tomb of Anchises was the attendant of\r\nhis father or the Genius of the place (Aen. V. 95).\r\n\r\nIn the Pompeian paintings, when a pair of serpents occurs, one may\r\nusually be recognized as a male by the prominent crest. They were\r\nundoubtedly looked upon as personifications of the Genii of the master\r\nand mistress of the house. When a single crested serpent appears, as\r\nin the shrine paintings of both the house of the Vettii (Fig. 127) and\r\nthe house of Apollo (Fig. 126), we are to understand that the head of\r\nthe household was unmarried.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. SECOND STORY ROOMS\r\n\r\nWith few exceptions the houses of pre-Roman Pompeii were built in only\r\none story; where the peristyle was in two stories, there must have\r\nbeen rooms opening upon the upper colonnade. In Roman times, as the\r\npopulation of the city increased and more space was needed, it became\r\na common practice to make the rooms about the atrium lower and build\r\nchambers over them. A complete second story was rare; small rooms were\r\nadded here and there, frequently at different levels and reached by\r\ndifferent stairways. Sometimes the second story on the front side\r\nprojected a few feet over the street; an example may be seen in a\r\nhouse in the seventh Region (casa del Balcone Pensile), the front of\r\nwhich, with the part projecting over the sidewalk, has been carefully\r\nrebuilt by replacing the charred remains of the ancient beams with new\r\ntimbers.\r\n\r\nHouses with three stories were quite exceptional, and the rooms of the\r\nthird floor must have been unimportant. Along the steep slope of the\r\nhill, on the west and southwest sides of the city, a number of houses\r\nare found that present the appearance of several stories; they are not\r\nproperly classed with those just mentioned, however, for the reason\r\nthat the floors are on terraces, the highest at the level of the\r\nstreet, the others lower down and further back, being adjusted to the\r\ndescent of the ground.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Plautus, second story rooms were designated as\r\n'dining rooms,' _cenacula_. Varro says that after it became customary\r\nto dine upstairs, all upper rooms were called cenacula. This\r\nexplanation is not altogether satisfactory, because other literary\r\nevidence for the prevalence of such a custom is lacking. Perhaps in\r\nearly times, when, on account of the introduction of the compluvium\r\nand impluvium, the atrium ceased to be convenient and comfortable for\r\nthe serving of meals, a dining room was frequently constructed on an\r\nupper floor, and, being the principal second story apartment, gave its\r\nname to the rest. In some places the ancient custom may still have\r\nlingered in the time of the Early Empire.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 128.--Interior of a house with a second story\r\n   dining room opening on the atrium, restored.]\r\n\r\nThe upper parts of the Pompeian houses in most cases have been\r\ncompletely destroyed; in a few, however, there are traces of a second\r\nstory apartment that was probably used as a dining room.\r\n\r\nOne of these houses is in Insula XV of Region VII, near the temple of\r\nApollo. It is painted in the second style, and dates apparently from\r\nthe end of the Republic. At the rear of the atrium are two rooms and a\r\npassageway leading to the back of the house. Over these was a single\r\nlarge apartment, closed at the sides and rear, but opening on the\r\natrium in its entire length; along the front, as seen in our\r\nrestoration (Fig. 128), ran a balustrade connecting the\r\npilasters--ornamented with half-columns--which supported the roof.\r\n\r\nIn a corner of the atrium at the rear a narrow stairway led to the\r\nsecond floor. At the right, as our section shows (Fig. 129), was a\r\nnarrow gallery resting on brackets, which connected the upper room at\r\nthe rear with one in the front of the house.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 129.--Longitudinal section of the house with a\r\n   second story dining room.\r\n\r\n   At the right, vestibule, door, and fauces, with front room\r\n   above; then the atrium, with the gallery connecting the front\r\n   room with the dining room; lastly, the apartments at the rear\r\n   of the house. In this house there was no peristyle.]\r\n\r\nThe large upper room was so well fitted for a dining room, especially\r\nin summer, that we can hardly resist the conclusion that it was\r\ndesigned for this purpose. There is no trace of a kitchen on the\r\nground floor; and for greater convenience this also was probably\r\nplaced in the second story, behind the dining room.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth Region there was a small dwelling, which afterwards\r\nbecame a part of the house of the Silver Wedding; the arrangement of\r\nthe two stories at the rear of the atrium was similar to that just\r\ndescribed, except that columns were used in place of the pilasters,\r\nand there was only the one upper room in the back part of the house.\r\nIn such cases as this 'dining room' and 'upper story' might easily\r\nhave come to be used as synonymous terms.\r\n\r\nWhere there was a large upper room at the rear of the atrium, no place\r\nwas left for the high tablinum; in a house in the seventh Region (casa\r\ndell' Amore Punito, VII. ii. 23) the cenaculum was in front. On the\r\nfront wall of the atrium one may still see part of the carefully hewn\r\nstones on which the columns of the second story rested, and fragments\r\nof these columns were found on the floor below.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. THE SHOPS\r\n\r\nThe outer parts of the houses fronting on the principal thoroughfares\r\nwere utilized as shops. On the more retired side streets there were\r\nfewer shops, and we often find a facade of masonry unbroken except for\r\nthe front door and an occasional window.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 130.--Plan of a Pompeian shop.\r\n\r\n     1. Entrance.\r\n     2. Counter.\r\n     3. Place for a fire.\r\n     4. Stairway to upper floor.\r\n     5, 5. Back rooms.]\r\n\r\nThe shop fronts were open to the street. The counter, frequently of\r\nmasonry, has in most cases the shape indicated on our plan (Fig. 130,\r\n2), being so arranged that customers could make their purchases, if\r\nthey wished, without going inside the shop. Large jars were often set\r\nin it, to serve as receptacles for the wares and edibles exposed for\r\nsale. Sometimes on the end next to the wall there are little steps, on\r\nwhich, as seen in our restoration (Fig. 131), measuring cups and other\r\nsmall vessels were placed. At the inner end we see now and then a\r\ndepression (3) over which a vessel could be heated, a fire being\r\nkindled underneath as on a hearth. In the wineshops a separate hearth\r\nis sometimes found, and occasionally a leaden vessel for heating\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn the houses of the Tufa Period the shops, as the front doors and the\r\nrooms about the atrium, were relatively high. Those of the house of\r\nCaecilius Jucundus measured nearly 16 feet; those of the house of the\r\nFaun, 19 feet; the appearance of the latter may be suggested by our\r\nrestoration (Fig. 139). The height was divided by an upper floor,\r\n_pergula_, 10 or 12 feet above the ground, along the open front of\r\nwhich was a balustrade; the stairs leading to it were inside the shop.\r\nOn such a pergula Apelles, according to Pliny (N. H. xxxv. 84), was\r\naccustomed to display his paintings; and in the Digest reference is\r\nmore than once made to cases in which a person passing along the\r\nstreet was injured by an object falling upon him from the second story\r\nof a shop. 'Shops with their upper floors' are advertised for rent in\r\none of the painted inscriptions found at Pompeii (p. 489).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 131.--A shop for the sale of edibles, restored.]\r\n\r\nIn Roman times the shops, as the inner rooms of the house, were built\r\nlower, and over them small closed rooms were made, which were called\r\nby the same name as the open floor, pergula. These rooms were\r\nfrequently accessible from the street by a stairway, and in such cases\r\ncould be rented separately. In colloquial language, a man whose early\r\nlife had been passed amid unfavorable surroundings was said to have\r\nbeen 'born in a room over a shop,'--_natus in pergula_.\r\n\r\nShops were entered by means of small doors; the front was closed with\r\nshutters. These consisted of overlapping boards set upright in narrow\r\ngrooves at the top and the bottom. A separate set of shutters was\r\nprovided for the open pergula.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII. WALLS, FLOORS, AND WINDOWS\r\n\r\nThe walls were covered with a thick layer of plaster and painted; the\r\npreparation of the stucco, the processes employed in painting, and the\r\nstyles of decoration are reserved for discussion in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nThe floors were frequently made of an inexpensive concrete, consisting\r\nof bits of lava or other stone pounded down into common mortar. A much\r\nbetter floor was the Signia pavement, _opus Signinum_, so named from a\r\ntown in Latium. This was composed of very small fragments of brick or\r\ntile pounded into fine mortar. The surface was carefully finished, and\r\nwas sometimes ornamented with geometrical or other patterns traced in\r\noutline by means of small bits of white stone.\r\n\r\nIn the Tufa Period a floor was often made by fitting together small\r\npieces of stone or marble, and bedding them well in mortar. The colors\r\nare white and black,--slate is used in the floor of the atrium in the\r\nhouse of the Faun; sometimes also violet, yellow, green, and red\r\nappear with white and black. Pavements of square or lozenge-shaped and\r\ntriangular pieces of colored marble and slate, like that in the cella\r\nof the temple of Apollo (Fig. 28), are occasionally found in houses.\r\nIn the time of the Early Empire floors paved with larger slabs were\r\nnot uncommon.\r\n\r\nThe mosaics of the Pompeian floors--using the term mosaic in a\r\nrestricted sense--may be divided into two classes, coarse and fine. In\r\nthe former the cubes, _tesserae_, are on the average a little less\r\nthan half an inch square. The patterns are sometimes shown in black on\r\na white surface, sometimes worked in colors. The finer variety, in\r\nwhich the pictures appear, is not often extended over a whole room,\r\nbut is usually confined to a rectangular section in the middle, coarse\r\nmosaic being used for the rest of the floor.\r\n\r\nThe windows at the front of the house, as we have seen, were\r\nordinarily few and small. From the Tufa Period, however, large windows\r\nwere often made in the rooms around the peristyle; in the house of the\r\nFaun they range in width from 10 to 23 feet, and are so low that one\r\nsitting inside could look out through them. Upper rooms, also, were\r\nprovided with windows of good size, sometimes measuring 21/2 by 4 feet;\r\nbut the remains are scanty. In later times occasionally a lower window\r\nopening on the street was made almost as large, and was protected by\r\nan iron grating.\r\n\r\nWindows were ordinarily closed by means of wooden shutters. Small\r\npanes of glass were found in the openings of the Baths near the Forum;\r\nhad the Central Baths been finished, glass would undoubtedly have been\r\nused for the windows of the caldarium. The window of the tepidarium in\r\nthe villa of Diomedes was closed by four glass panes set in a wooden\r\nframe (p. 357); in the other houses a narrow pane is occasionally\r\nfound, but invariably set in masonry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n_THE HOUSE OF THE SURGEON_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe house of the Surgeon (casa del Chirurgo) is the oldest of the\r\nPompeian houses that retained to the last, with but slight\r\nmodifications, its original plan and appearance. It lies at the right\r\nof the Strada Consolare (VI. i. 10), about fifty paces inside the\r\nHerculaneum Gate. The name was suggested by the discovery of several\r\nsurgical instruments in one of the rooms.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 132.--Plan of the house of the Surgeon.\r\n\r\n     1. Fauces.\r\n     5.

Stairway to rooms over the rear of the house.\r\n     19. Room with window opening on the garden.\r\n     20. Garden.]\r\n\r\nThis house was undoubtedly built before 200 B.C. The facade (Fig. 10)\r\nand the walls of the atrium are of large hewn blocks of Sarno\r\nlimestone; other inner walls are of limestone framework (p. 37). The\r\nplan conforms to the simple Italic type, before the addition of the\r\nperistyle; yet it does not illustrate the oldest form of the native\r\nhouse, for the tablinum (Fig. 132, 7) has already displaced the recess\r\nfor the bed opposite the front door. The measurements of the rooms are\r\naccording to the Oscan standard (p. 44), the atrium being about 30 by\r\n35 Oscan feet.\r\n\r\nWe pass directly from the street through the fauces (1) into the\r\nTuscan atrium (5) at the sides of which are sleeping rooms (6) and\r\nthe two alae (8). Back of the tablinum is a colonnade (16) opening on\r\nthe garden (20), which originally had a greater length; the room at\r\nthe right (19) is a later addition, as also the smaller room at the\r\nother end (21). The roof of the colonnade was carried by square\r\nlimestone pillars, one of which has been preserved in its original\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThe oblong room at the right of the tablinum (10) was once square, as\r\n(9). Both were well adapted for winter dining rooms; in summer, meals\r\nwere undoubtedly served in the tablinum. The room at the left of the\r\nentrance (2) was a shop, at least in later times. The corresponding\r\nroom on the other side (6') was retained for domestic use.\r\n\r\nThe shop at the right (3) and the back room (4), as well as the\r\nkitchen with the adjoining rooms at the rear, used as store closets\r\nand quarters for slaves, were a later addition; 22 is a light court,\r\nto which the rain water was conducted from different parts of the\r\nroof. Over these rooms was a second story reached by stairs leading\r\nfrom the colonnade (18). It may be that this part of the house took\r\nthe place of a garden in which previously there was an outside\r\nkitchen; that the ground belonged to the house from the beginning is\r\nclear from the existence of a door between the rooms 6' and 3,\r\nafterwards walled up, and the appearance of the unbroken party wall on\r\nthis side.\r\n\r\nThe rooms about the atrium had no upper floor, and were relatively\r\nhigh; the doors measured nearly twelve feet in height, and the ceiling\r\nof the tablinum was not far from twenty feet above the floor. In\r\nrespect to height, this house was not unlike those of the next period.\r\n\r\nIn the later years of the city, but before 63, the decoration was\r\nrenewed in the fourth style. There are paintings of interest, however,\r\nonly in the room at the rear (19), which had a large window opening on\r\nthe garden. In one of the panels here we see a man sitting with a\r\nwriting tablet in his hand; opposite him are two girls, one sitting,\r\nthe other standing; the latter holds a roll of papyrus. This kind of\r\ngenre picture is not uncommon; the type is spoken of elsewhere (p.\r\n477).\r\n\r\nIn another panel, which was transferred to the Naples Museum, a young\r\nwoman is represented as painting a herm of Dionysus (Fig. 133); a\r\nCupid is holding the unfinished picture while she mixes colors on her\r\npalette. Two other maidens are watching the artist with unfeigned\r\ninterest. Upon the pillar behind the herm hangs a small painting; in\r\nthe vista another herm is seen, together with a vase standing on a\r\npillar.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 133.--A young woman painting a herm. Wall painting\r\n   from the house of the Surgeon.]\r\n\r\nThe room contained a third picture which is now almost obliterated.\r\nPerhaps this pleasant apartment was once the boudoir of a favorite\r\ndaughter, who busied herself with painting and verse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n_THE HOUSE OF SALLUST_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe house of Sallust (VI. ii. 4) received its name from an election\r\nnotice, painted on the outside, in which Gaius Sallustius was\r\nrecommended for a municipal office. It has no peristyle, and its\r\noriginal plan closely resembled that of the house of the Surgeon. It\r\nwas built in the second century B.C.; the architecture is that of the\r\nTufa Period, and the well preserved decoration of the atrium,\r\ntablinum, alae, and the dining room at the left of the tablinum (Fig.\r\n134, 22) is of the first style. The pilasters at the entrances of the\r\nalae and the tablinum are also unusually well preserved; the house is\r\namong the most important for our knowledge of the period to which it\r\nbelongs.\r\n\r\nThe rooms on the left side (6-9) were used as a bakery. Those in front\r\n(2-5) were shops; two of them (2, 3), at the time of the destruction\r\nof the city, opened into the fauces (1) and another (5) had two rear\r\nrooms, one of which was entered from a side street.\r\n\r\nThe rooms at the right (31-36) were private apartments added later and\r\nconnected with the rest of the house only by means of the corridor\r\n(29), which with the cell designed for the porter (30) was made over\r\nfrom one of the side rooms of the atrium.\r\n\r\nIf we leave these groups of rooms out of consideration, it is easy to\r\nsee that the Tuscan atrium and the apartments connected with it--the\r\ntablinum (19), the alae (17), and the rooms at the sides--once formed\r\na symmetrical whole. At the rear was a garden on two sides (24, 24'),\r\nwith a colonnade. A broad window in the rear of the left ala opened\r\ninto this colonnade (p. 259), a part of which was afterwards enclosed,\r\nmaking two small rooms (23, 18). At the end of the latter room a\r\nstairway was built leading to chambers; in the beginning the house had\r\nno second floor.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 134.--Plan of the house of Sallust.\r\n\r\n     1. Fauces.\r\n     2, 3. Shops opening on the fauces.\r\n     4, 5. Shops.\r\n     6-9. Bakery\r\n       (6. Millroom with three mills (_a_), and stairway to upper floor.\r\n       7. Oven.\r\n       8.

Kitchen.)]\r\n\r\nThe andron (20), the wardrobe (17') at the side of the right ala, and\r\nthe small room back of it (28) were made out of a square room\r\ncorresponding in dimensions with that at the other end of the tablinum\r\n(22). The latter was originally entered from the atrium by a door at\r\n_e_, which was closed when the wide door was made at the rear opening\r\nupon the colonnade. At the rear of the tablinum is a broad window.\r\n\r\nIn the corner of the garden is an open air triclinium (25), over which\r\nvines could be trained; there was a small altar (_l_) near by. At _n_\r\na jet of water spurted from an opening in the wall upon a small\r\nplatform of masonry; the water was perhaps conducted into the\r\nrectangular basin (_k_) opposite, the inside of which was painted\r\nblue. Only the edges of this portion of the garden, which is higher\r\nthan the floor of the colonnade, were planted; steps led up to it at\r\n_f_ and _g_. A hearth (_p_) was placed in the colonnade at the left,\r\nfor the preparation of the viands served in the triclinium. The room\r\nat the other end of the garden (27) was connected with the street at\r\nthe rear by a posticum; back of it was an open space (26) with remains\r\nof masonry (_m_), the purpose of which is not clear.\r\n\r\nThe large dining room (13) may once have belonged to the bakery; the\r\nanteroom (12) leading to it was made from one of the side rooms of the\r\natrium. The arrangement recalls that of the dining room of which the\r\nplan is given in Fig. 124.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the atrium in its original form may be suggested by\r\nour restoration (Fig. 135). The proportions are monumental. The\r\ntreatment of the entrances to the tablinum and the alae, with\r\npilasters joined by projecting entablatures, the severe and simple\r\ndecoration (illustrated in Fig. 261), and the admission of light\r\nthrough the compluvium increased the apparent height of the room and\r\ngave it an aspect of dignity and reserve. At the rear we catch\r\nglimpses of the vines and shrubs at the edge of the garden; painted\r\ntrees and bushes were also seen upon the garden wall.\r\n\r\nThe series of apartments entered through the room at the right of the\r\natrium (29) present a marked contrast with the rest of the house. They\r\nare low, the eight-sided, dark-red columns of the colonnade (31), with\r\ntheir white capitals, being less than ten feet high; and the dark\r\nshades of the decoration, which is in the fourth style upon a black\r\nground, give a gloomy impression to one coming from the atrium with\r\nits masses of brilliant color.\r\n\r\nThere was a small fountain in the middle of the little garden (32),\r\nthe rear wall of which is covered by a painting representing the fate\r\nof Actaeon, torn to pieces by his own hounds as a penalty for having\r\nseen Diana at the bath. At first the colonnade had a flat roof, with\r\nan open walk above on the three sides; but when the large dining room\r\n(35) was constructed, the flat roof and promenade on this side were\r\nreplaced by a sloping roof over the broad entrance to the dining room.\r\nOn the outer walls of the two sleeping rooms (33, 34) were two\r\npaintings of similar design, Europa with the bull, Phrixus and Helle\r\nwith the ram. The rear inner wall of 34 contained two pairs of lovers,\r\nParis and Helen in the house of Menelaus, and Ares and Aphrodite. The\r\nroom at the corner of the colonnade (36) is the kitchen; the stairway\r\nin it led to the flat roof of the colonnade.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 135.--Atrium of the house of Sallust, looking\r\n   through the tablinum and colonnade at the rear into the garden,\r\n   restored.]\r\n\r\nThis portion of the house probably dates from the latter part of the\r\nRepublic; it underwent minor changes in the course of the century\r\nduring which it was used. Previously there was in all probability a\r\ngarden on this side, into which opened a large window in the rear wall\r\nof the right ala, afterwards closed.\r\n\r\nThe changes made in the stately house of the pre-Roman time are most\r\neasily explained on the supposition that near the beginning of the\r\nEmpire it was turned into a hotel and restaurant. The shop at the left\r\nof the entrance (3) opens upon the atrium as well as on the street;\r\nthe principal counter is on the side of the fauces, and near the inner\r\nend is a place for heating a vessel over the fire. Large jars were set\r\nin the counter, and there was a stone table in the middle of the room.\r\nHere edibles and hot drinks were sold to those inside the house as\r\nwell as to passers-by. The shop at the right of the entrance was\r\nconnected with the fauces, the atrium, and a side room (16). The\r\nnumber of sleeping rooms had been increased by changes in several of\r\nthe earlier apartments, and by the addition of a second floor reached\r\nby the stairway in room 18. The private apartments were for the use of\r\nthe proprietor, and were guarded against the intrusion of the guests\r\nof the inn by the porter stationed at the entrance (in 30).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 136.--Longitudinal section of the house of\r\n   Sallust, restored.\r\n\r\n   At the left, the fauces with the counter of the shop; then the north\r\n   side of the atrium with the entrance of the left ala, the north side\r\n   of the tablinum, with one of the pilasters at the entrance from the\r\n   atrium; lastly, the colonnade at the back and the vine-covered\r\n   triclinium in the corner of the garden.]\r\n\r\nThis explanation is confirmed by the close connection of the bakery\r\nwith the house; and the use of the open-air triclinium is entirely\r\nconsistent with it (p. 404). The arrangement of the house after it had\r\nbecome an inn may be seen in our section (Fig. 136).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n_THE HOUSE OF THE FAUN_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe house of the Faun, so named from the statue of a dancing satyr\r\nfound in it (Fig. 258), was among the largest and most elegant in\r\nPompeii. It illustrates for us the type of dwelling that wealthy men\r\nof cultivated tastes living in the third or second century B.C. built\r\nand adorned for themselves. The mosaic pictures found on the floors\r\n(now in the Naples Museum) are the most beautiful that have survived\r\nto modern times.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 137.--Plan of the house of the Faun.\r\n\r\n     A.

Shops.]\r\n\r\nThe wall decoration, which is of the first style, in the more\r\nimportant rooms was left unaltered to the last, and is well preserved.\r\nThis decoration, however, does not date from the building of the\r\nhouse. In order to protect the painted surfaces against moisture, the\r\nwalls in the beginning were carefully covered with sheets of lead\r\nbefore they were plastered. Later two doorways were walled up, and\r\nthe plastering over the apertures, which was applied directly to the\r\nwall surface without the use of lead sheathing, forms with its\r\ndecoration an inseparable part of that found on either side. When the\r\noriginal decoration was replaced by that which we see on the walls\r\nto-day it is impossible to determine, but the change must have been\r\nmade before the first century B.C. A few unimportant rooms are painted\r\nin the second and fourth styles.\r\n\r\nAn entire block (VI. xii.), measuring approximately 315 by 115 feet,\r\nis given to the house; there are no shops except the four in front\r\n(Fig. 137). The apartments are arranged in four groups: a large Tuscan\r\natrium, B, with living rooms on three sides; a small tetrastyle\r\natrium, _b_, with rooms for domestic service around it and extending\r\non the right side toward the rear of the house; a peristyle, G, the\r\ndepth of which equals the width of the large and half that of the\r\nsmall atrium; and a second peristyle, K, occupying more than a third\r\nof the block. At the rear of the second peristyle is a series of small\r\nrooms (_q-u_) the depth of which varies according to the deviation of\r\nthe street at the north end of the insula.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 138.--Part of the cornice over the large front\r\n   door.]\r\n\r\nIn front of the main entrance we read the word HAVE (more commonly\r\nwritten _ave_), 'Welcome!' spelled in the sidewalk with bits of green,\r\nyellow, red, and white marble. The street door here, quite\r\nexceptionally, was at the outer end of the vestibule. It consisted of\r\nthree leaves (seen in Fig. 139) and opened toward the inside, while\r\nthe double door between the vestibule and the fauces (A on the plan)\r\nopened toward the outside; the closed vestibule was not unlike those\r\nof many modern houses. Fragments of the lintel over the outer door,\r\nwith its projecting dentil cornice, are preserved in one of the shops\r\n(Fig. 138).\r\n\r\nThe shops with their upper floors, _pergulae_, were nineteen feet\r\nhigh. When the shutters were up they presented a monotonous appearance\r\n(Fig. 139), but on sunny days, when the articles offered for sale\r\nwere attractively displayed, and buyers and idlers were loitering in\r\nfront or leisurely passing from one to the other, shops and street\r\nalike were full of color and animation.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 139.--Facade of the house of the Faun, restored.\r\n\r\n   At the left, the front of a shop (1 on the plan) with its upper\r\n   floor; then the large front door, two shops, the entrance of\r\n   the smaller atrium and the fourth shop, which, like the second,\r\n   is completely closed by shutters.]\r\n\r\nThe floor of the fauces, as of many of the other rooms, is rich in\r\ncolor. It is made of small triangular pieces of marble and slate--red,\r\nyellow, green, white, and black. At the inner end it was marked off\r\nfrom the floor of the atrium by a stripe of finely executed mosaic,\r\nsuggestive of a threshold (Fig. 140), now in the Naples Museum. Two\r\ntragic masks are realistically outlined, appearing in the midst of\r\nfruits, flowers, and garlands, the details of which are worked out\r\nwith much skill.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 140.--Border of mosaic with tragic masks, fruits,\r\n   flowers, and garlands, at the inner end of the fauces.]\r\n\r\nThe walls of the fauces are ornamented in an unusual manner. The\r\nordinary decoration of the first style is carried to the height of\r\neight feet. Above this on either side projects a tufa shelf about\r\nsixteen inches wide, on which is placed the facade of a diminutive\r\ntemple; that on the left is seen in Fig. 141. The front of the cella,\r\nwith closed doors, is presented in relief, but the four columns of the\r\nportico stand free. The shelf is supported underneath by a cornice\r\nwhich rested originally on stucco brackets in the shape of dogs; the\r\nunderside is carved to represent a richly ornamented coffered ceiling.\r\n\r\nThe atrium was a room of imposing dimensions. The length is\r\napproximately 53 feet, the breadth 33; the height, as indicated by the\r\nremains of the walls and the pilasters, was certainly not less than 28\r\nfeet. Above was a coffered ceiling. The sombre shade of the floor,\r\npaved with small pieces of dark slate, formed an effective contrast\r\nwith the white limestone edge and brilliant inner surface of the\r\nshallow impluvium, covered with pieces of colored marbles similar to\r\nthose in the fauces. Still more marked was the contrast in the strong\r\ncolors of the walls. Below was a broad surface of black; then a\r\nprojecting white dentil cornice, and above this, masses of dark red,\r\nbluish green, and yellow. The decoration, as usual in the first style,\r\nwas not carried to the ceiling, but stopped just above the side doors;\r\nthe upper part of the wall was left in the white.\r\n\r\nAs one stepped across the mosaic border at the end of the fauces, a\r\nbeautiful vista opened up before the eyes. From the aperture of the\r\ncompluvium a diffused light was spread through the atrium brilliant\r\nwith its rich coloring. At the rear the lofty entrance of the tablinum\r\nattracted the visitor by its stately dignity. Now the portieres are\r\ndrawn aside, and beyond the large window of the tablinum the columns\r\nof the first peristyle are seen (Fig. 141). The shrubs and flowers of\r\nthe garden are bright with sunshine, and fragrant odors are wafted\r\nthrough the house; in the midst a slender fountain jet rises in the\r\nair and falls with a murmur pleasant to the ear. If the vegetation was\r\nnot too luxuriant, one might look into the exedra, on the further side\r\nof the colonnade, and even catch glimpses of the trees and bushes in\r\nthe garden of the second peristyle.\r\n\r\nOf the rooms at the side of the atrium, one (_f'_) was apparently the\r\nfamily sleeping room; places for two beds were set off by slight\r\nelevations in the floor. This room had been carefully redecorated in\r\nthe second style; the room opposite, the decoration of which was\r\ninferior to that of the rest, was perhaps used by the porter\r\n(_atriensis_).\r\n\r\nThe tablinum (D), like that of the house of Sallust, had a broad\r\nwindow opening on the colonnade of the peristyle. In the middle of\r\nthis room is a rectangular section paved with lozenge-shaped pieces of\r\nblack, white, and green stone; the rest of the floor is of white\r\nmosaic. The floor of each ala was ornamented with a mosaic picture. In\r\nthat at the left (C) are doves pulling a necklace out of a casket--a\r\nwork of slight merit.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 141.--Longitudinal section of the house of the\r\n   Faun, showing the large atrium, the first peristyle, and a corner\r\n   of the second peristyle, restored.\r\n\r\n     Vestibule\r\n     Door\r\n     Fauces\r\n     Tuscan atrium with compluvium and impluvium (B)\r\n     Ala (C)\r\n     Tablinum (D)\r\n     First peristyle with colonnade and fountain basin (G)\r\n     Exedra (H)\r\n     Corner of the second peristyle (K)]\r\n\r\nThe mosaic picture found in the right ala is characterized by delicacy\r\nof execution and harmonious coloring. It is divided into two parts;\r\nabove is a cat with a partridge; below, ducks, fishes, and shellfish.\r\nA large window in the rear wall of this ala opens into the small\r\natrium, not for the admission of light, but for ventilation; in summer\r\nthere would be a circulation of air between the two atriums.\r\n\r\nTwo doors, at the right and the left of the tablinum (seen in Fig.\r\n143), opened into large dining rooms, one (E) nearly square, the other\r\n(F) oblong. Both had large windows on the side of the peristyle, and\r\nthe one at the left also a door opening upon the colonnade. The mosaic\r\npictures in the floors harmonized well with the purpose of the rooms.\r\nIn one were fishes of various kinds, and sea monsters; in the other\r\nwas the picture--often reproduced--in which the Genius of the autumn\r\nis represented as a vine-crowned boy sitting on a panther and drinking\r\nout of a deep golden bowl.\r\n\r\nThe colonnade of the first peristyle was of one story (Fig. 141). The\r\nentablature of the well proportioned Ionic columns presented a mixture\r\nof styles often met with in Pompeii, a Doric frieze with a dentil\r\ncornice. The wall surfaces were divided by pilasters and decorated in\r\nthe first style. In the middle of the garden the delicately carved\r\nstandard of a marble fountain basin may still be seen.\r\n\r\nThe open front of the broad exedra (H) was adorned with two columns,\r\nand at the rear was a window extending almost from side to side,\r\nopening upon the second peristyle. Between the columns of the entrance\r\nwere mosaic pictures of the creatures of the Nile,--hippopotamus,\r\ncrocodile, ichneumon, and ibis; and in the room, filling almost the\r\nentire floor, was the most famous of ancient mosaic pictures, the\r\nbattle between Alexander and Darius.\r\n\r\nThis great composition has so often been reproduced that we need not\r\npresent it here; as illustrating the style and treatment, however, we\r\ngive a small section, in which the face of Alexander appears (Fig.\r\n142). The mosaic is a reproduction of a painting made either in the\r\nlifetime of Alexander, or soon after his death. The battle is perhaps\r\nthat of Issus. The left side of the picture is unfortunately only in\r\npart preserved. At the head of the Greek horsemen rides Alexander,\r\nfearless, unhelmeted, leading a charge against the picked guard of\r\nDarius. The long spear of the terrible Macedonian is piercing the side\r\nof a Persian noble, whose horse sinks under him. The driver of\r\nDarius's chariot is putting the lash to the horses, but the fleeing\r\nking turns with an expression of anguish and terror to witness the\r\ndeath of his courtier, the mounted noblemen about him being\r\npanic-stricken at the resistless onset of the Greeks. The grouping of\r\nthe combatants, the characterization of the individual figures, the\r\nskill with which the expressions upon the faces are rendered, and the\r\ndelicacy of coloring give this picture a high rank among ancient works\r\nof art. The colors in the mosaic are necessarily more subdued than in\r\nthe original painting.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 142.--Detail from the mosaic picture representing\r\n   a battle between Alexander and Darius.\r\n\r\n   Alexander, having thrown aside his helmet, is leading the charge upon\r\n   the guard of Darius, who is already in flight.]\r\n\r\nA corridor (_p_), both ends of which could be closed, led from the\r\nfirst to the second peristyle. The columns here, of the Doric order,\r\nwere of brick, with tufa capitals, the shafts being edged, not fluted.\r\nThe entablature rested on a line of timbers, as often in the buildings\r\nof the Tufa Period. In our restoration (Fig. 141) an upper colonnade\r\nof the Ionic order is assumed, extending about the four sides. The\r\nrestoration is here possibly at fault; the colonnade may have been in\r\ntwo stories only on the south side, with twice as many columns above\r\nas below.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the exedra were two dining rooms (I, J), one open in\r\nits entire breadth upon the second peristyle, the other having a\r\nnarrow door with two windows. The fine mosaic picture in I was found\r\nin so damaged a condition that the subject--a lion standing over a\r\nprostrate tiger--could not be made out, until a duplicate was\r\ndiscovered in 1885.\r\n\r\nIn the sleeping room on the other side of the corridor (N), which had\r\nbeen redecorated in the second style, remains of two beds were found.\r\nThe room next to it (L) was the largest in this part of the house; at\r\nthe time of the eruption it was without decoration and was used as a\r\nwine cellar. A great number of amphorae were found in it, as also in\r\nboth peristyles.\r\n\r\nOne of the small rooms at the rear (_q_) was perhaps occupied by the\r\ngardener; the one next to it (_r_) was the doorkeeper's room. At _v_\r\nis a long, shallow niche, designed for statues. Nearer the corner were\r\ntwo smaller niches, each of which was ornamented in front with\r\npilasters and a gable. These were the shrines of the household gods;\r\nin front of them were found two bronze tripods, two bronze lamp\r\nstands, two pairs of iron tongs, a couple of common lamps, and the\r\nremains of a branch of laurel with the bones and eggs of a dove that\r\nhad nested in it. A bronze statuette of a Genius was found seemingly\r\nin one of the niches.\r\n\r\nThe domestic apartments were entered by a front door between the two\r\nshops at the right (Fig. 139). The vestibule, unlike that of the other\r\nentrance, is open to the street, the fauces being narrower and deeper.\r\nThe relation of the tetrastyle to the Tuscan atrium is indicated in\r\nour transverse section (Fig. 143). The alae (_c_, _c'_) are here at\r\nthe middle of the sides; the one at the left served as a passageway\r\nbetween the two atriums. The four tufa Corinthian columns, nearly\r\ntwenty feet high, are well preserved, as well as the pilasters at the\r\nentrances of the alae. A tablinum was not needed in this part of the\r\nhouse, and the space which it might have occupied was given to the\r\nandron (_k_) and a sleeping room opening on the first peristyle (_l_).\r\n\r\nThis part of the house was much damaged by the earthquake of 63, and\r\nthere are many traces of repairs, particularly in the upper rooms. The\r\nwalls were simply painted in the fourth style. Two money chests stood\r\non large flat stones in the rear corners of this atrium.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 143.--Transverse section of the house of the Faun,\r\n   showing the two atriums with adjoining rooms.\r\n\r\n     Sleeping room (f)\r\n     Tuscan atrium (B) with entrance of tablinum (D)\r\n     Left ala (c) of tetrastyle atrium\r\n     Tetrastyle atrium (b)\r\n     Right ala (c')]\r\n\r\nIn one of the rooms at the front (_e_) there are traces of shelves;\r\nstairs at one side led to the upper rooms at the left of the atrium,\r\nthe shape and size of which are indicated in Fig. 143. On the right,\r\nalso, there were small chambers over _g_, _h_, and _h'_, on the same\r\nlevel as the second floor of the shop in front (4), and accessible\r\nonly by means of the stairway in this shop; there were no other stairs\r\nin this corner of the house, and these rooms could not have been\r\nconnected with chambers over other parts of the atrium, because there\r\nwere no upper rooms over the fauces and the right ala (_c'_). Another\r\nstairway in _d_, partly of wood, led to chambers over _i_, _d'_, _n'_,\r\n_n_, _o_, _o'_, and part of the kitchen, M.\r\n\r\nBronze vessels and remains of ivory feet belonging to a bedstead were\r\nfound in the double room _h_, _h'_; but it is more likely that this\r\nwas used as a storeroom for discarded furniture than that members of\r\nthe family slept here.\r\n\r\nA long corridor at the end of the first peristyle (_m_) connected the\r\nrooms at the right of the small atrium with the closet (_n_), the bath\r\n(_o_, _o'_), the kitchen (M), and the large bedroom (N) opening on the\r\nsecond peristyle. The two rooms of the bath, tepidarium and caldarium,\r\nwere provided with hollow floors and walls, and were heated from the\r\nkitchen, into which the draft vents (p. 188) opened; in order to make\r\nthe smoke less objectionable, the kitchen was built very high, with\r\nseveral windows.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen is of unusual size. A niche for the images of the\r\nhousehold gods was placed in the wall at the left, so high up that it\r\ncould only have been reached by means of a ladder. The front is shaped\r\nto resemble the facade of a small temple, and in it is a small altar\r\nof terra cotta for the burning of incense.\r\n\r\nThe first room at the right of the corridor (_n'_) was completely\r\nexcavated in 1900, and found to be a stall. In it were brought to\r\nlight the skeletons of two cows and of four human beings, an adult and\r\nthree children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n_A HOUSE NEAR THE PORTA MARINA_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe height of the important rooms can be accurately determined in so\r\nfew houses of the Tufa Period, that special importance attaches to a\r\nhouse on the edge of the city north of the Porta Marina (No. 13), in\r\nwhich not merely the three-quarter columns at the entrance of the\r\ntablinum, but also the pilasters at the corners of the fauces and alae\r\nand part of the Ionic columns of the peristyle are seen in their full\r\nheight. The atrium is the best preserved of any in the large pre-Roman\r\nhouses, and the height of the ceiling in several of the adjoining\r\nrooms is clearly indicated. The house lies about seventy paces north\r\nof the Strada della Marina, on the last street leading to the right.\r\nIt is without a name and is seldom visited.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 144.--Plan of the house near the Porta Marina.]\r\n\r\nNeither the decoration, renewed in the second style and without\r\npaintings, nor the arrangement of the rooms (Fig. 144) requires\r\nextended comment. There are two atriums, the smaller with the domestic\r\napartments being at the left and entered directly from the street. The\r\nfauces of the other are of unusual width, being about two fifths of\r\nthe width of the atrium. The alae are at the middle of the sides, as\r\nin the house of Epidius Rufus and the smaller atrium of the house of\r\nthe Faun. At the sides of the tablinum are large windows opening into\r\ntwo dining rooms, which are entered from the peristyle.\r\n\r\nMore than a third of the plot enclosed by the peristyle is taken up by\r\na deep rectangular basin for fish. At the rear are apparently other\r\nrooms, adjusted to the slope of the ground, which, however, have not\r\nyet been excavated.\r\n\r\nIt will, perhaps, be easier to appreciate the stately character of the\r\npre-Roman atriums if we give a few of the dimensions which were used\r\nin making our restoration (Fig. 145).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 145.--Longitudinal section of the house near the\r\n   Porta Marina.\r\n\r\n     Vestibule\r\n     Fauces\r\n     Ala\r\n     Atrium\r\n     Tablinum\r\n     Peristyle\r\n     Fish pond]\r\n\r\nThe atrium is 41 by 29 feet. The tablinum measures 13 feet 9 inches\r\nbetween the three-quarter columns which stand, in place of the usual\r\npilasters, at the entrance; it is thus half as wide as the atrium. The\r\nheight of the tablinum at the entrance is 18 feet 6 inches; according\r\nto the proportions given by Vitruvius it should be 15 feet 4 inches.\r\n\r\nThe alae and fauces also exceed the dimensions presented by the Roman\r\narchitect, the former being 12-2/3 feet wide and 16-1/4 feet high, while\r\nthe height of the broad fauces, 17-1/2 feet, is only a trifle less than\r\nthat of the tablinum.\r\n\r\nThe height of the walls of the atrium is easily determined with the\r\nhelp of the data before us; and the arrangement of the roof over the\r\nfauces, atrium, tablinum, and colonnade of the peristyle must have\r\nbeen very similar to that shown in our restoration. The entablature\r\nseen over the entrance of the left ala is restored in accordance with\r\nthe architectural forms commonly used in the period when the house was\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\nBoth the three-quarter columns and the pilasters present a peculiarity\r\nof construction found also in other houses, but not easy to explain.\r\nThe former appear as half-columns on the side of the tablinum, but\r\npresent fully three fourths of their breadth on the side of the\r\natrium. The pilasters at the entrances of the alae and fauces have, on\r\nthe inside, a good proportion, the breadth being about one eighth of\r\nthe height; but on the outside, toward the atrium, they are much more\r\nslender.\r\n\r\nA well designed scroll pattern appears in the black and white mosaic\r\nfloor of the fauces, which, as often in Pompeian houses, slopes gently\r\ntoward the street. The floor of the atrium is made of black mosaic\r\nwith pieces of colored marble arranged in rows, and white stripes at\r\nthe edges. The base of a shrine for the household gods stands against\r\nthe right wall. In the first room at the right was an alcove for a bed\r\nopposite the door; the ceiling of the alcove, in the form of a vault,\r\nwas lower than that of the rest of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n_THE HOUSE OF THE SILVER WEDDING_\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the more interesting of the large houses excavated in the last\r\ndecade is the house of the Silver Wedding, which marks the limit of\r\nexcavation in the fifth Region (V. ii. _a_ on Plan VI). The main part\r\nwas cleared in 1892 (Fig. 8); and in April, 1893, in connection with\r\nthe festivities with which the Silver Wedding of the King and Queen of\r\nItaly was celebrated, a special excavation was made in one of the\r\nrooms, in the presence of their Majesties and of their imperial\r\nguests, the Emperor and Empress of Germany. Portions of the house are\r\nstill covered, the facade, the inner end of the oecus, and the greater\r\npart of an extensive garden on the left side.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the extent of the house--the greatest length is not\r\nfar from 150 feet, the breadth of the excavated portion 130--and the\r\nnumber of apartments, the plan is simple (Fig. 146). From the fauces\r\n(_a_) we pass into a tetrastyle atrium (_d_), the largest of its kind\r\nyet discovered, with alae on either side and a high tablinum (_o_).\r\nBack of this is a Rhodian peristyle, at the rear of which is an exedra\r\n(_y_) with sleeping rooms at the right and the left (_x_, _z_).\r\nOpening into the rear of the peristyle on one side is the oecus (4),\r\non the other a long dining room (_w_).\r\n\r\nAnother series of apartments lay between the peristyle and the garden at\r\nthe right (2), a kitchen (_s_), and a bath (_t-v_). In front of the\r\ngarden and extending to the street is a small house ([alpha]-[iota])\r\nwhich had been joined to the larger establishment; it was connected with\r\nthis by a small door under the stairs in the corner of the atrium\r\n([beta]), which opened into a side room (_e_) of the large atrium.\r\n\r\nThe essential parts of the house date from the Tufa Period.\r\nAlterations were made from time to time in the course of the two\r\ncenturies during which it was occupied, but they were not so extensive\r\nas to obscure the original plan. The most obvious changes were those\r\naffecting the wall decoration.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 146.--Plan of the house of the Silver Wedding.\r\n\r\n     _a._ Fauces.\r\n     _d._ Tetrastyle atrium.\r\n     _n._ Dining room.\r\n     _o._ Tablinum.\r\n     _p._ Andron.\r\n     _r._ Peristyle.\r\n     _s._ Kitchen.\r\n     _t-v._ Bath.\r\n       (_v._ Apodyterium.\r\n       _u._ Tepidarium.\r\n       _t._ Caldarium.)\r\n     _w._ Summer dining room.\r\n     _x_, _z_.

Fauces, atrium, and other rooms of separate\r\n       dwelling connected with the larger house.]\r\n\r\nIn the small rooms at the right of the atrium are traces of the\r\ndecoration of the first style, which was in vogue when the house was\r\nbuilt. Toward the end of the Republic almost the whole interior was\r\nredecorated in the second style, but without paintings. Brilliant\r\nblocks and panels dating from this renovation may still be seen upon\r\nthe upper part of the walls of the atrium and on those of the oecus,\r\nthe exedra, the two bedrooms next to the exedra, and the front part of\r\nthe long apodyterium.\r\n\r\nAfterwards a few rooms were done over in the third style, of which\r\nscanty remains are found.\r\n\r\nLastly, after the fourth style had come into vogue, but before 60\r\nA.D.--as shown by an inscription on a column of the peristyle--a large\r\npart of the house was redecorated in the fourth style, including the\r\ntablinum, the andron and the room at the right (_q_), the peristyle,\r\nthe long dining room (_w_), and the inner portion of the apodyterium.\r\nThe lower part of the walls of the atrium were also painted over, but\r\nwith designs and coloring that harmonized well with the decoration of\r\nthe second style above. In this house the history of Pompeian wall\r\ndecoration can be followed from the century after the Second Punic War\r\nto the middle of the first century of our era, from the time of Cato\r\nthe Elder to that of Claudius and Nero. There are few paintings,\r\nhowever, and they are not of special interest.\r\n\r\nIn marked contrast with the atriums in the house of the Faun and the\r\nother houses which we have examined, the atrium here had a relatively\r\nlarge compluvium (Fig. 147); all parts of the room must have been\r\nbrilliantly lighted. In summer some kind of protection against the sun\r\nwas a necessity. It was probably afforded by hanging curtains between\r\nthe columns; on the side of each column, facing the corner of the\r\natrium, is a bronze ring through which a cord might have been passed\r\nto use in drawing the curtains back and forth. The large compluvium\r\nwith its supporting columns suggests the arrangement of the Corinthian\r\natrium.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the atrium are monumental. The length is\r\napproximately 54 feet, the breadth 40; and the Corinthian columns of\r\ntufa coated with stucco, are 22-3/4 feet high.\r\n\r\nAt the rear of the impluvium is a fluted cistern curb of white marble\r\n(seen in Fig. 8). In the impluvium near the edge is the square\r\npedestal of a fountain figure, which threw a jet into a round marble\r\nbasin in front.\r\n\r\nThe doors of the rooms at the sides of the atrium were originally more\r\nthan thirteen feet high; those which we now see are comparatively low.\r\nThe height was reduced because a second floor was placed in the rooms,\r\nthus making low chambers, which were reached by three stairways, one\r\n(_g_) at the right of the atrium, the other two (_k_ and _m_) on the\r\nopposite side. The upper rooms were lighted by small windows, part of\r\nwhich opened into the atrium, others upon the garden on the left side\r\nof the house. These changes were completed before the atrium received\r\nits decoration in the second style. There was no second story over the\r\nalae, the tablinum, or the rooms about the peristyle. In the left ala\r\nwas once a large window opening on the garden, but it was afterwards\r\nwalled up (p. 259).\r\n\r\nThe curtain fastenings on the pilasters at the front of the tablinum\r\nhave been referred to in another connection (p. 256). The arrangement\r\nof the rooms at the sides is not unlike that in the house of Sallust;\r\none, _n_, retained its original form; the other was divided up into an\r\nandron (_p_), with a bedroom (_q_) at one side.\r\n\r\nThe peristyle is remarkably well preserved. We find not only the\r\ncolumns in their full height, but also, except on the north side,\r\nlarge portions of the entablature, with its stucco ornamentation\r\nintact, supported on a line of planks placed upon the columns at the\r\ntime of excavation; and the decoration of the walls retains much of\r\nits brilliancy of coloring.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 147.--Longitudinal section of the house of the\r\n   Silver Wedding.\r\n\r\n     Fauces\r\n     Tetrastyle atrium\r\n     Ala\r\n     Tablinum\r\n     Rhodian peristyle\r\n     Entrance to oecus\r\n     Exedra]\r\n\r\nThe colonnade of this peristyle has been mentioned elsewhere as\r\nillustrating the Rhodian form (p. 260). The difference in height\r\nbetween the colonnade in front and on the other three sides was\r\naccentuated in the decoration. On the walls in front are large red\r\npanels separated by architectural designs on a yellow background; the\r\nwalls under the lower part of the colonnade were painted with black\r\npanels, the designs of the narrow intermediate sections being on a\r\nwhite background. The lower third of the columns in front was yellow;\r\nat the sides and rear, dark red, like that on the lower part of the\r\nhigh columns in the atrium. Thus a pleasing contrast was made between\r\nthe portions of the colonnade designed to receive the sunshine,\r\nparticularly in winter, and the shadier parts; and the higher front\r\nserved as an intermediate member between the lofty atrium with its\r\nstately tablinum and the lower rear division of the house.\r\n\r\nThe ornamentation of the architrave retains no trace of the decorative\r\nforms in vogue at the time when it was constructed. The surface,\r\nmoulded in stucco, is divided into sections, corresponding with the\r\ncapitals and intercolumniations, as in the colonnade of the Stabian\r\nBaths (Fig. 89); in these sections are small figures of birds and\r\nanimals and other suitable designs, the effect being heightened by the\r\nuse of color.\r\n\r\nThat the decoration of the peristyle received its present form before\r\nthe earthquake is evident from an inscription scratched upon the\r\nplaster of one of the columns on the north side:\r\n\r\n     _Nerone Caesare Augusto\r\n     Cosso Lentulo Cossi fil[io] co[n]s[ulibus]\r\n     VIII Idus Febr[u]arias\r\n     Dies Solis, Luna XIIIIX, nun[dinae] Cumis, V nun. Pompeis_,--\r\n\r\n'In the consulship of Nero and of Cossus Lentulus the son of Cossus,'\r\nthat is 60 A.D. The dates given in the rest of the inscription are\r\ndifficult to explain, and the reading of the number after _Luna_ is\r\nuncertain. The memorandum seems to indicate that the eighth day before\r\nthe Ides of February in this year was the market day at Cumae, being\r\nSunday and the sixteenth day after the New Moon; and that the market\r\nday at Pompeii came three days later. The inscription is the earliest\r\nyet found in which a day of the week is named in connection with a\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nThe garden plot enclosed by the peristyle was watered by means of two\r\njets at the front corners, fed by pipes under the floor. In the middle\r\nwas a slight elevation on which were found two crocodiles, a huge\r\ntoad, and a frog of a whitish glazed earthenware, apparently made in\r\nEgypt. The figures are about sixteen inches long.\r\n\r\nEach of the bedrooms at the rear had an alcove for a bed, the ceiling\r\nbeing vaulted over the alcove, flat between this and the door; a\r\ndistinction between the two parts of the room was made also in the\r\nwall decoration and in the floor, of black and white mosaic. The\r\nfrescoing on the walls of the sleeping rooms presents a brilliant\r\nvariety of colors; the decoration of the exedra is in yellow. One of\r\nthe bedrooms has a small side door (p. 261). In the large dining room\r\nat the right (_w_) the place for the table is indicated by an\r\nornamental design in the mosaic floor; in the oecus (4) the part of\r\nthe room designed for the table and couches is distinguished from the\r\nrest by a difference in the decoration both of the floor and of the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nIn the oecus, the excavation was made from which the house received\r\nits name. The peristyle had already been cleared, and the volcanic\r\ndebris had been, for the most part, removed from the front part of the\r\noecus, leaving a layer at the bottom about two feet deep. The King and\r\nQueen of Italy, with the Emperor and Empress of Germany and a small\r\nsuite, stationed themselves in the corner of the peristyle opposite\r\nthe opening of the oecus; when all was ready a line of workmen\r\nproceeded to draw back the loose fragments of pumice stone, exposing\r\nthe floor to view. Here nothing was found except the bronze fastenings\r\nof the large doors; but a more fruitful outcome followed a similar\r\nsearch in a room of a small house adjoining the oecus on the south, in\r\nwhich several vessels of bronze were brought to light.\r\n\r\nThe bath is unusually complete for a private house, comprising a long,\r\nnarrow apodyterium (_v_), an open-air swimming tank in the garden (1),\r\na tepidarium (_u_), and a caldarium (_t_). Steps led down into the\r\nswimming tank at the corner nearest the door of the apodyterium, and\r\nalso on the side furthest from the house; on the same side a jet fell\r\ninto it from a marble standard adorned with a lion's head. If we\r\nimagine a thick growth of shrubs and flowers about the tank, we have\r\nthe setting which explains the tasteful decoration of the frigidarium\r\nin the Stabian Baths (p. 191) and in the Baths near the Forum.\r\n\r\nThe pavement of the apodyterium is especially effective, being\r\ncomposed of small bits of black, white, dark red, green, and yellow\r\nmarble and stone; near the rear wall a place for a couch is left\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nThe caldarium and the side of the tepidarium next to it were provided\r\nwith hollow walls; a hollow floor extended under both rooms. In the\r\nleft wall of the tepidarium is the bronze mouth of a water pipe;\r\nperhaps in winter a cold bath was taken here rather than in the\r\nswimming tank. In the caldarium the niche for the labrum remains; the\r\nbath basin probably stood opposite the entrance, where it could be\r\neasily heated from the kitchen.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 148.--Transverse section of the house of the\r\n   Silver Wedding, as it was before 63.\r\n\r\n     Garden with colonnade\r\n     Tetrastyle atrium\r\n     Small atrium]\r\n\r\nAbove the broad hearth of the kitchen (_s_), which stands against the\r\nwall adjoining the garden, are the vestiges of a painting of the two\r\nLares; near them a serpent is seen coiled around an altar, on which is\r\na large pine cone. At the end next the caldarium is a depression in\r\nthe floor, for convenience in building a fire to heat the bath rooms.\r\nIn the corner is a foundation of masonry to support the vessel, of\r\nlead, in which water was kept for the bath.\r\n\r\nThe colonnade at the left of the house (6 on the Plan; see Fig. 148),\r\nwith its slender eight-sided columns, seems to have been thrown down\r\nby the earthquake of 63, and removed. In the place of four of the\r\ncolumns an open-air triclinium was made, like that in the house of\r\nSallust. It is well preserved, and shows an interesting peculiarity of\r\nconstruction. When the table was not in use, a jet of water would\r\nspring from the foundation of masonry supporting the round top. The\r\nwater was conveyed by a lead pipe, and at the rear of the colonnade\r\none may still see the stopcock by which the flow was regulated.\r\n\r\nThe stairway at the left of the small atrium ([beta]) led to rooms over\r\nthe front of the house. Over the rooms at the rear, a bedroom ([gamma]),\r\na central room ([delta]) taking the place of the tablinum, and a\r\ncorridor ([epsilon]), was a dining room, the front of which was\r\nsupported by columns (p. 275), the stairway being in the corridor;\r\nfragments of the tufa columns are lying on the floor. At the back of the\r\nhouse was originally only the small sleeping room ([zeta]) with a simple\r\ndecoration in the first style, and a colonnade ([eta]) with Doric\r\ncolumns opening on the garden ([kappa]). Later the colonnade was turned\r\ninto an apartment, and two rooms were built at the left, a dining room\r\n([theta]) and a bedroom ([iota]).\r\n\r\nIn the front of one of the rooms ([lambda]) is an unusually well\r\npreserved niche for the images of the household gods, ornamented with\r\nstucco reliefs and painted in the last style. On the rear wall stands\r\nHercules, with the lion's skin hanging from his left arm, his club on\r\nthe left shoulder.

In one respect it resembles the oldest Pompeian houses, such\r\nas that of the Surgeon; in the place of the peristyle is a garden\r\nextending back from a colonnade at the rear of the tablinum. In a\r\nperiod when large peristyles were the fashion, a Pompeian of wealth\r\nand taste, whose building lot was ample enough to admit of an\r\nextension of his house toward the rear, contented himself with a\r\nsingle group of rooms arranged about one central apartment.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of rooms is seen at a glance (Fig. 149). The\r\nvestibule, like that of the principal entrance in the house of the\r\nFaun, had a triple door at the end toward the street (shown in Fig.\r\n150), which was no doubt left open in the daytime. Entering, one would\r\npass into the fauces ordinarily through the small door at the right\r\n(p. 248), the large double doors between the vestibule and the fauces\r\nonly being opened for the reception of clients or on special\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nThe front of each ala (7, 13) is adorned with two Ionic columns. At\r\nthe corners of the entrances are pilasters, the Corinthian capitals of\r\nwhich have a striking ornament, a female head, moulded in stucco,\r\nlooking out from the midst of the acanthus leaves. The eyes and hair\r\nare painted, and in one instance the features of a bacchante can be\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nIn the right ala is an elaborate house shrine, built like a temple\r\nwith a facade supported by columns, raised on a podium five feet high\r\n(Fig. 151). On the front of the podium is a dedicatory inscription to\r\nthe Genius of the master (p. 270).\r\n\r\nThe tablinum originally opened on the atrium in its full width, the\r\nentrance being set off by pilasters at the corners. It was then\r\nhigher; when the entrance was changed the height was reduced to about\r\ntwelve feet. The sixteen Doric columns about the impluvium, well\r\npreserved for the most part, are only a trifle over fourteen feet\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 149.--Plan of the house of Epidius Rufus.\r\n\r\n     1. Raised sidewalk.\r\n     2. Vestibule, with side door.\r\n     7, 13. Alae: in one (7) a house shrine.\r\n     15. Stairway to rooms over 17, 21.\r\n     17. Sleeping room, with alcove.\r\n     18.

Flower garden.]\r\n\r\nThe contrast between this atrium and the lofty halls of the houses of\r\nSallust and the Faun was indeed marked. Here the atrium had become\r\nmore like a court than a hall; yet the impluvium, paved with tufa, was\r\nretained, and we find the same arrangement for the flow of water as in\r\nmany houses with Tuscan and tetrastyle atriums. On the edge of the\r\nimpluvium at the rear is the pedestal of a fountain figure which threw\r\na jet into a basin resting on two rectangular standards; the places of\r\nthese, as well as the course of the feed pipe, are indicated on the\r\nplan. Behind the pedestal is a round cistern curb; another jet rose in\r\nthe middle of the impluvium.\r\n\r\nThe apartment at the right of the tablinum (20) was a dining room. Of\r\nthe smaller rooms about the atrium, three (6, 8, and 12) were sleeping\r\nrooms for members of the family; some of the others were so poorly\r\ndecorated as to prompt the suggestion that they were intended for\r\nslaves. That next the stairs (14) was a storeroom; the traces of the\r\nshelving are easily distinguished. Under the stairs was a low room\r\n(16), perhaps used for a similar purpose; the small double room (17)\r\nwas also low, and used as a sleeping room.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 150.--Facade of the house of Epidius Rufus,\r\n   restored.]\r\n\r\nThe domestic apartments were reached by the andron (18). In the\r\nkitchen (21) is a broad hearth (_b_); a dim light was furnished by\r\nnarrow windows. The little room at the entrance of the kitchen (_a_)\r\nwas perhaps a storeroom; the closet, as often, was in the corner of\r\nthe kitchen.\r\n\r\nAt the opposite end of the colonnade is the gardener's room (23). The\r\nmain part of the garden (24), as indicated by the arrangement of the\r\nground, was used for vegetables; the small flower garden at the rear\r\n(25) was on a higher level.\r\n\r\nIn the house originally there was no second floor. In the Roman\r\nperiod, apparently near the end of the Republic, a large upper\r\nroom--probably a dining room--was built over the kitchen; and there\r\nmay have been one or two small storerooms at the head of the stairway\r\nwhich was built in one of the side rooms of the atrium.\r\n\r\nTraces of the first and third decorative styles are found in the\r\natrium; but the most interesting remains are those of the last style.\r\nThe alae and several rooms were redecorated shortly before the\r\ndestruction of the city. The dining room (20) contains a series of\r\npaintings illustrating the contest between Apollo and Marsyas; they\r\nare skilfully displayed in a light architectural framework on a white\r\nground. On the wall at the left (at _a_) Apollo is seen with left foot\r\nadvanced, striking with his right hand a large cithara which rests\r\nagainst his left shoulder. Opposite him (at _b_) is Marsyas, playing\r\nthe double flute; on the intervening panels (_d_, _e_) are the Muses,\r\nwho are acting as judges in the contest of skill. The painting at _c_\r\nseems to relate to Apollo, but the subject has not been explained. The\r\nchoice of subjects such as these may have been influenced by the cult\r\nof the early divinity of the city; but it probably implies a taste for\r\npoetry and music on the part of the proprietor.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 151.--Transverse section of the house of Epidius\r\n   Rufus, restored.\r\n\r\n     Ala\r\n     Door of Andron\r\n     Front of Tablinum\r\n     Door of Dining room\r\n     Ala with Shrine]\r\n\r\nThere were no shops in the front of this house, but in one respect our\r\nrestoration of the facade (Fig. 150) can not be taken as indicating\r\nthe appearance of such houses in general. Here the front line was set\r\nback several feet from that of the adjoining houses on either side,\r\nand the space thus gained was given to a terrace or ramp about four\r\nfeet high, mounted by steps at either end. The elevation of the front\r\nentrance above the sidewalk and the placing of the approaches at the\r\nends of the ramp gave the house an appearance of seclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n_THE HOUSE OF THE TRAGIC POET_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the \"Last Days of Pompeii\" the house of the Tragic Poet is\r\npresented to us as the home of Glaucus. Though not large, it was among\r\nthe most attractive in the city. It received its present form and\r\ndecoration not many years before the eruption, apparently after the\r\nearthquake of 63, and well illustrates the arrangements of the\r\nPompeian house of the last years.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 152.--Plan of the house of the Tragic Poet.\r\n\r\n     1. Fauces.\r\n     2, 2. Shops.\r\n     3. Atrium.\r\n     4, 4. Stairways to upper floor.\r\n     5. Porter's room.\r\n     6, 6. Sleeping rooms.\r\n     6'. Storeroom.\r\n     7. Ala.\r\n     8.

Posticum.]\r\n\r\nThe house received its name at the time of excavation, in consequence\r\nof a curious misinterpretation of a painting--now in the Naples\r\nMuseum--which was found in the tablinum. The subject is the delivery\r\nto Admetus of the oracle which declared that he must die unless some\r\none should voluntarily meet death in his place. On one side sits\r\nAdmetus, with his devoted queen Alcestis; opposite them is the\r\nmessenger who is reading the oracle from a roll of papyrus. The\r\nexcavators thought that the scene represented a poet reciting his\r\nverses; and since they found, in the floor of the tablinum, a mosaic\r\npicture in which an actor is seen making preparations for the stage,\r\nthey concluded that the figure with the papyrus in the wall painting\r\nmust be a tragic poet.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 153.--View of the house of the Tragic Poet,\r\n   looking from the middle of the atrium through the tablinum toward the\r\n   shrine at the end of the peristyle.\r\n\r\n   At the right, the andron. In the foreground, a cistern curb, at the\r\n   rear of the impluvium.]\r\n\r\nThe plan (Fig. 152) presents slight irregularities; yet in essential\r\npoints the arrangement of rooms does not differ materially from that\r\nwhich we have found in the houses of the pre-Roman time. As our\r\nsection (Fig. 154) shows, all the parts of the house are comparatively\r\nlow; the ceiling of the atrium and of the large dining room at the\r\nrear (15) were only a few feet higher than the colonnade of the\r\nperistyle. The entrances of the ala--here there is but one--and of the\r\ntablinum are not adorned with pilasters; plain wooden casings were\r\nused instead. The second story rooms are not an afterthought but a\r\npart of the architect's design; the stairways (4) leading to them are\r\nsymmetrically placed at the sides of the atrium. There was no upper\r\nfloor, however, over the fauces, the atrium, or the tablinum. To a\r\nmodern visitor this dwelling would have seemed more homelike and\r\ncomfortable than the monumental houses of the earlier time.\r\n\r\nThe large shops (2) are both connected with the house by doors opening\r\ninto the fauces (1). They were doubtless the proprietor's place of\r\nbusiness. In one of them gold ornaments were found, but we should\r\nscarcely be warranted in assuming from this fact that the master of\r\nthe house was a goldsmith.\r\n\r\nIn the floor of the fauces, immediately behind the double front door,\r\nis a dog, attached to a chain, outlined in black and white mosaic,\r\nwith the inscription, _cave canem_, 'Beware of the dog!' The picture\r\nwas for many years in the Naples Museum. The black and white mosaic is\r\nwell preserved in the atrium, the tablinum (Fig. 153), and the dining\r\nroom opening on the peristyle, as well as in the fauces.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the various rooms is in most cases easy to determine.\r\nThe first at the left of the atrium (5) was the room of the porter,\r\n_atriensis_. The three rooms marked 6 were sleeping rooms, as were\r\nalso 12 and 14 opening on the peristyle; 6' was a storeroom, 13 the\r\nkitchen. There was a colonnade on three sides of the peristyle;\r\nagainst the wall at the rear stands the shrine of the household gods\r\n(seen in Fig. 153) in which was found a marble statuette of a satyr\r\ncarrying fruits in the fold of a skin hanging in front of him.\r\n\r\nThe decoration of the large dining room (15) is especially effective.\r\nIn the front of the room is a broad door opening into the colonnade of\r\nthe peristyle; each of the three sides contains three panels, in the\r\nmidst of a light but carefully finished architectural framework. In\r\nthe central panels are large paintings: at _r_, a young couple looking\r\nat a nest of Cupids; at _q_, Theseus going on board ship, leaving\r\nbehind him the beautiful Ariadne; and at _p_ a composition in which\r\nArtemis is the principal figure. In four of the smaller panels are the\r\nSeasons, represented as graceful female figures hovering in the air;\r\nthe others present youthful warriors with helmet, shield, sword, and\r\nspear, all well conceived and executed with much delicacy.\r\n\r\nThe atrium, unlike most of those at Pompeii, was rich in wall\r\npaintings. Six panels, more than four feet high, presented a series of\r\nscenes from the story of the Trojan war, as told in the \"Iliad.\" These\r\nwere united with the decorative framework in such a way as to make a\r\nharmonious and pleasing whole; the main divisions of the right wall of\r\nthe atrium, as well as of the fauces and tablinum, are indicated in\r\nFig. 154.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 154.--Longitudinal section of the house of the\r\n   Tragic Poet, restored.\r\n\r\n     Large dining room\r\n     Peristyle\r\n     Kitchen\r\n     Tablinum\r\n     Ala\r\n     Atrium\r\n     Impluvium\r\n     Stairs\r\n     Fauces]\r\n\r\nIn arranging the pictures, the decorators had little regard for the\r\norder of events. The subjects were the Nuptials of Zeus and Hera (at\r\n_a_ on the plan); the judgment of Paris (_b_)--though this is\r\ndoubtful, as the picture is now entirely obliterated; the delivery of\r\nBriseis to the messenger of Agamemnon (_c_); the departure of Chryseis\r\n(_d_), and seemingly Thetis bringing arms across the sea to Achilles\r\n(_f_). Of the painting at _e_ only a fragment remained, too small to\r\nmake it possible to recognize the subject. The fragment at _f_, in\r\nwhich were seen a Triton, two figures riding on a sea horse, and a\r\nCupid on a dolphin, is now entirely faded. Half of the painting in\r\nwhich Chryseis appears was already ruined at the time of excavation;\r\nthe other half was transferred to the Naples Museum, together with the\r\npaintings that were best preserved, the Nuptials of Zeus and Hera, and\r\nthe sending away of Briseis.\r\n\r\nThe two pictures last mentioned are among the best known of the\r\nPompeian paintings, and have often been reproduced. In one (Fig. 273)\r\nwe see Zeus sitting at the right, while Hypnos presents to him Hera,\r\nwhose left wrist he gently grasps in his right hand as if to draw her\r\nto him. Hera seems half reluctant, and her face, which the artist, in\r\norder to enhance the effect, has directed toward the beholder rather\r\nthan toward Zeus, is queenly in its majesty and power. The scene is\r\nlocated on Mt. Ida. In the background stands a pillar, on which are\r\nthree small figures of lions; below at the side are two pipes,\r\ncymbals, and a tambourine, all sacred to the potent divinity of Mt.\r\nIda, Cybele. Three youths, crowned with garlands, appear in the lower\r\nright hand corner of the picture; they are perhaps the Dactyli, demons\r\nskilled in the working of metals who followed in the train of Cybele.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 155.--The sending away of Briseis. Wall painting\r\n   from the house of the Tragic Poet.]\r\n\r\nA higher degree of dramatic interest is manifested in the other\r\npainting, which we present in outline (Fig. 155). In the foreground\r\nat the right, Patroclus leads forward the weeping Briseis. In the\r\nmiddle Achilles, seated, looks toward Patroclus with an expression of\r\nanger, and with an impatient gesture of the right hand directs him to\r\ndeliver up the beautiful captive to the messenger of Agamemnon, who\r\nstands at the left waiting to receive her. Behind Achilles is Phoenix,\r\nhis faithful companion, who tries to soften his anger with comforting\r\nwords. Further back the helmeted heads of warriors are seen, and at\r\nthe rear the tent of Achilles.\r\n\r\nThe scene is well conceived. Yet in both this picture and the one\r\npreviously described, the composition seems to lack depth and\r\nperspective. The artist is remarkably skilful in portraying facial\r\nexpression, and foreground details; his limitations are apparent in\r\nthe handling of groups. We have the feeling that the first designs\r\nwere not made freely with brush or pencil, but that the artist was\r\nhere translating into painting designs which he found already worked\r\nout in reliefs. The original paintings, of which these are copies,\r\nvery likely go back to the fourth century B.C.\r\n\r\nAnother painting worthy of more than passing mention was found on a\r\nwall of the peristyle (at _o_), and removed to the Naples Museum. The\r\nsubject is the sacrifice of Iphigenia, who was to be offered up to\r\nArtemis that a favorable departure from Aulis might be granted to the\r\nGreek fleet assembled for the expedition against Troy (Fig. 156).\r\n\r\nAt the right stands Calchas, deeply troubled, his sheath in his left\r\nhand, his unsheathed sword in his right, his finger upon his lips. The\r\nhapless maid with arms outstretched in supplication is held by two\r\nmen, one of whom is perhaps Ulysses. At the left is Agamemnon, with\r\nface averted and veiled head, overcome with grief. Beside him leans\r\nhis sceptre, and on a pillar near by we see an archaic statue of\r\nArtemis with a torch in each hand, a dog on either side. Just as the\r\ngirl is to be slain, Artemis appears in the sky at the right, and from\r\nthe clouds opposite a nymph emerges bringing a deer, which the goddess\r\naccepts as a substitute.\r\n\r\nIn this painting, also, though the style is entirely different from\r\nthat of the others, we perceive the limitations of the artist in the\r\ntreatment of the background. Nevertheless the boldness of the\r\nconception, and the skill manifested in the handling of several of the\r\nfigures, seem to point to an original of more than ordinary merit.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 156.--The sacrifice of Iphigenia. Wall painting.]\r\n\r\nNot far from 400 B.C. the sacrifice of Iphigenia was made the subject\r\nof a painting by Timanthes, in which the maiden was represented as\r\nstanding beside the altar. We are told that the artist painted Calchas\r\nsorrowful, Ulysses more sorrowful, Ajax lamenting, and Menelaus in\r\nsorrow so deep that deeper sorrow could not be expressed; finding it\r\nimpossible to portray the grief of the father, Agamemnon, Timanthes\r\nrepresented him with veiled head.\r\n\r\nThe veiled Agamemnon appears in our painting, and the figure of\r\nCalchas perhaps reflects the conception of Timanthes. For the rest, it\r\nis difficult to establish a relation between the two pictures; even if\r\nwe did not know that Iphigenia, in the painting of Timanthes, stood\r\nbeside an altar, we could scarcely believe that a great painter would\r\nhave represented her thus awkwardly carried. Undoubtedly the Pompeian\r\npainting, or its original, is indebted to the masterpiece of the Greek\r\nartist; but the decorative painter has adapted this to suit his\r\npurpose, omitting the figures, the facial expression of which was most\r\ndifficult to reproduce, and at the same time attempting to heighten\r\nthe effect by making more prominent the helplessness and terror of the\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\n_THE HOUSE OF THE VETTII_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe house of the Vettii, excavated in the years 1894-1895, bears the\r\nsame relation to the other houses built in the Roman period that the\r\nhouse of the Faun does to those of the earlier time; it is the most\r\nimportant representative of its class. It was situated in a quiet part\r\nof the city, and was not conspicuous by reason of its size; its\r\ninterest for us lies chiefly in its paintings and in the adornment of\r\nthe well preserved peristyle.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 157.--Exterior of the house of the Vettii,\r\n   restored.]\r\n\r\nThe relationship between the two owners, Aulus Vettius Restitutus and\r\nAulus Vettius Conviva (p. 508) is not known. They were perhaps\r\nfreedmen, manumitted by the same master; Conviva, as we learn from a\r\npainted inscription, was a member of the Brotherhood of\r\nAugustus,--_Vetti Conviva, Augustal[is]_.\r\n\r\nThe exterior of the house (Fig. 157) was unpretentious. The main\r\nentrance was on the east side, and there was a side door near the\r\nsoutheast corner; elsewhere the street walls were unbroken except by\r\nsmall, square windows, part of which were in low second story rooms.\r\n\r\nThe vestibule (Fig. 158, _a_), as in the house of Epidius Rufus (p.\r\n248), was connected with the fauces (_b_) by a large double door and\r\nalso by a small door at the right. The atrium (_c_) is without a\r\ntablinum; at the rear it opens directly on the peristyle. One of the\r\nalae (_h_) at the time of the eruption was used as a wardrobe. At the\r\nsides of the atrium were two money chests; the one at the right is\r\nseen in Fig. 159.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 158.--Plan of the house of the Vettii.\r\n\r\n     _a._ Vestibule.\r\n     _b._ Fauces.\r\n     _c._ Atrium.\r\n     _h_, _i_.

A door at the right leads into a\r\nsmall side peristyle (_s_, shown in Fig. 160), with a quiet dining\r\nroom (_t_) and bedroom (_u_).\r\n\r\nThe domestic apartments were near the front of the house. At the right\r\nof the principal atrium is a small side atrium (_v_) without a\r\nseparate street entrance. Grouped about it were rooms for the slaves\r\nand the kitchen (_w_) with a large hearth (Fig. 125). Beyond the\r\nkitchen is a room for the cook (_x'_). At the rear of the small\r\natrium is the niche for the household gods (Fig. 127).\r\n\r\nThe corridor at the left of the principal atrium ([gamma]) led to an\r\nunimportant room ([beta]) with a door opening on a side street. In this\r\ncorridor there was a stairway to the second story, which extended over\r\nthis corner of the house (above _e_, _f_, _h_, _n_, _o_, [beta],\r\n[delta]). Along the front also were low chambers, over the fauces and\r\nthe small rooms on either side (_d_, _k_), and over the rooms adjoining\r\nthe small atrium (_x_, _y_, _z_).\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying sections two restorations of the interior are\r\ngiven. In the first (Fig. 159) we are looking toward the right side of\r\nthe atrium and the inner end of the peristyle; the depth of the\r\nperistyle more than equals that of the atrium, together with the\r\nvestibule and fauces. The difference in height between the atrium and\r\nthe peristyle, as in the house of the Tragic Poet, is much less than\r\nin the houses built in the pre-Roman period; and the corners of the\r\nalae were protected by simple wooden casings, altogether unlike the\r\nstately pilasters of the olden time.\r\n\r\nThe transverse section (Fig. 160) presents the long side of the\r\nperistyle next to the atrium, with the side of the small peristyle at\r\nthe north end. The extent of the house is greater measured across the\r\ntwo peristyles (along the line C-D on the plan) than from front to\r\nrear. Of the three entrances from the atrium into the peristyle, that\r\nin the middle is broader and higher than the other two, which are not\r\nmuch wider than ordinary doors; the arrangement of the openings is\r\nsimilar to that in houses having a tablinum open toward the peristyle\r\nwith an andron on one side, and on the other a room with a door\r\ncorresponding with the door of the andron.\r\n\r\nThe columns of the peristyle are well preserved (Fig. 161). They are\r\nwhite, with ornate capitals moulded in stucco and painted with a\r\nvariety of colors. Part of the entablature also remains; the\r\narchitrave is ornamented with an acanthus arabesque in white stucco\r\nrelief on a yellow background.\r\n\r\nThe roof of the greater part of the colonnade has been restored, and\r\nthe garden has been planted with shrubs in accordance with the\r\narrangement indicated by the appearance of the ground at the time of\r\nexcavation. Nowhere else in Pompeii will the visitor so easily gain an\r\nimpression of the aspect presented by a peristyle in ancient times.\r\nThe main part of the house was searched for objects of value after the\r\neruption, but the garden was left undisturbed, and we see in it to-day\r\nthe fountain basins, statuettes, and other sculptures placed there by\r\nthe proprietor.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 159.--Longitudinal section of the house of the\r\n   Vettii, restored.\r\n\r\n     Colonnade (_l_)\r\n     Large Room (_q_)\r\n     Garden with fountains and sculptures (_m_)\r\n     Peristyle\r\n     Colonnade (_l_)\r\n     Ala (_i_)\r\n     Impluvium\r\n     Atrium\r\n     Money chest\r\n     Door of side atrium\r\n     Fauces (_b_)\r\n     Vestibule (_a_)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 160.--Transverse section of the house of the\r\n   Vettii, restored, showing the two peristyles.\r\n\r\n     Small peristyle (_s_)\r\n     End of small dining room\r\n     End of dining room (_p_)\r\n     Colonnade\r\n     Window in right ala (_i_)\r\n     Openings into the atrium\r\n     Large peristyle\r\n     End of dining room (_n_)\r\n     Door of room (_o_)\r\n     Colonnade]\r\n\r\nIn each corner of the colonnade is a round fountain basin (indicated\r\non the plan), at each side an oblong basin, all of marble. Jets fell\r\ninto them from statuettes standing on pedestals beside the columns;\r\nthere were two figures for each side basin, one each for those at the\r\ncorners. The two statuettes at the inner end of the colonnade (Fig.\r\n162) are of bronze; they represent a boy with a duck, from the bill of\r\nwhich the water spurted. The rest are of marble, and not of special\r\ninterest. Among them are a Bacchus and two satyrs. The water pipes\r\nwere so well preserved that it has been found possible to place them\r\nin repair, and they are now ready for use. There were also two\r\nfountains in the garden.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 161.--Base, capital, and section of the\r\n   entablature from the colonnade of the peristyle.]\r\n\r\nNear the middle of the garden is a round, marble table. Three others\r\nstand under the colonnade, one of which, at the right near the inner\r\nend, is particularly elegant. The three feet are carved to represent\r\nlions' claws; the heads above are well executed, and there are traces\r\nof yellow color on the manes. On two pillars in the garden are double\r\nbusts, the subjects of which are taken from the bacchic cycle. One\r\nrepresents Bacchus and a bacchante (Fig. 257), the other Bacchus and\r\nAriadne; there are traces of painting on the hair, beard, and eyes.\r\n\r\nThe wall paintings of this house are the most remarkable yet\r\ndiscovered at Pompeii. Although the decoration of which they form a\r\npart is throughout of the fourth style, they fall into two groups, an\r\nearlier and a later, distinguished by differences in composition and\r\nhandling that are easily perceived.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 162.--Peristyle of the house of the Vettii,\r\n   looking south from the colonnade at the north end.]\r\n\r\nThe earlier paintings are found in the atrium (_c_), the alae (_h_,\r\n_i_), and the large room at the end of the peristyle (_q_). At the time\r\nwhen they were painted the left ala (_h_) was connected with the room\r\nbehind it (_n_) by a door, and had a large window opening on the\r\nperistyle like that in the other ala (seen in Fig. 160). Afterwards\r\nboth window and door were walled up and the ala was turned into a\r\nwardrobe. After this change had been made, as the remains of the\r\nmasonry show, the earthquake of 63 threw down a part of the wall\r\nbetween the ala and the peristyle. The earlier paintings, then, must\r\nhave been placed upon the walls before the year 63, in the reign of\r\nClaudius or the earlier part of the reign of Nero.\r\n\r\nThe later pictures are on the walls of the fauces (_b_), the large\r\napartment at the left of the atrium (_e_), the colonnade of the\r\nperistyle (_l_), the two dining rooms opening on the peristyle (_n_,\r\n_p_), and the small peristyle (_s_) with the adjoining rooms (_t_,\r\n_u_); to the same class belongs also the painting of the Genius with\r\nthe Lares in the side atrium (_v_), which, aside from this, contains\r\nno pictures. The remaining rooms present nothing of interest.\r\n\r\nThe paintings of the first group are characterized by refinement in\r\nthe choice of subjects, fertility in the composition, firmness of\r\ntouch in the drawing, and exquisite finish in even the smallest\r\ndetails. The colors used are simple and harmonious, violent contrasts\r\nbeing avoided. A number of these pictures show the hand of a true\r\nartist, whose work has been found in no other house, and the system of\r\ndecoration is the most effective of its kind in Pompeii.\r\n\r\nThe decoration of the walls painted after the earthquake is not unlike\r\nthat found in other houses upon walls of the fourth style. The designs\r\nare sketchy and without painstaking in the handling of details; the\r\nlines are coarse, the colors sometimes crude. The pictures in the\r\npanels are by different painters, some of whom were not without skill,\r\nyet none far above the average. One of the decorators had a fondness\r\nfor representing mythological death scenes, manifesting a taste little\r\nshort of barbarous.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the earlier and the later decoration is so marked\r\nthat it seems impossible to explain except on the assumption of a\r\nchange of owners. We may well believe that about the middle of the\r\nfirst century this was the home of a family of culture and standing,\r\nwho secured for the decoration of it the best artist that could be\r\nobtained, bringing him perhaps from Rome or from a Greek city. But\r\nwithin a score of years afterwards the house passed into the hands of\r\nthe Vettii, freedmen, perhaps, whose taste in matters of art was far\r\ninferior to that of the former occupants, and a number of rooms were\r\nredecorated.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE VIII.--TWO WALL PAINTINGS IN THE HOUSE OF THE\r\n   VETTII\r\n\r\n   APOLLO AFTER THE SLAYING OF THE DRAGON\r\n\r\n   AGAMEMNON IN THE SHRINE OF ARTEMIS]\r\n\r\nThe excellent preservation of a large part of both the earlier and the\r\nlater decoration gives the house the appearance of an art gallery. To\r\ndescribe fully and interpret all the paintings would require a small\r\nvolume. The limitations of space make it possible to present here only\r\nthe more important; we commence with those in the large room at the\r\nright of the peristyle, which are the most interesting of the entire\r\nseries.\r\n\r\nThis apartment (_q_) may have been used either as a dining room or as\r\na sitting room. The scheme of decoration is indicated in Fig. 163,\r\nwhich presents the division of the end wall; the side walls had five\r\nlarge panels instead of three.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 163.--Scheme of wall division in the large room\r\n   opening on the peristyle.]\r\n\r\nThe ground of the base is black. The stripe separating the base from\r\nthe main part of the wall is red, except the small sections (4, 4),\r\nwhich have a black ground; the vertical stripes between the panels are\r\nblack, and the same color forms the background of the border above.\r\nThe ground of the panels is cinnabar red. The painting in the central\r\npanel (1) has not been preserved; in those at the sides (2) are\r\nfloating figures. The upper division of the wall (6) is filled with an\r\narchitectural framework upon a white background, against which many\r\nfigures, skilfully disposed, stand out with unusual distinctness.\r\n\r\nThe floating figures in the side panels differ from those found\r\nelsewhere in the choice of subjects. Here instead of satyrs and\r\nbacchantes we find gods and heroes. In one panel is Poseidon with a\r\nfemale figure, perhaps Amymone; in another, Apollo with Daphne.\r\nBacchus and Ariadne also appear, and Perseus with Andromeda.\r\n\r\nThe figures in the upper part of the wall at the end of the room\r\nbelong to the bacchic cycle,--Silenus, satyrs, and bacchantes. Of\r\nthose at the sides, one, near the right-hand corner, represents a poet\r\nwith a roll of papyrus against his chin, the open manuscript case,\r\n_scrinium_, at his feet; opposite him sits a maiden clothed in white,\r\ndrinking in his words. A comic mask on the left wall seems to suggest\r\na writer of comedy, and the scene reminds one of the letter of Glycera\r\nto Menander, in Alciphron: \"What is Athens without Menander, what\r\nMenander without Glycera? Without me, who make ready your masks, who\r\nlay out your costume, and then stand behind the scenes pressing my\r\nfinger tips into the palms of my hands till the applause breaks forth.\r\nThen all a-trembling I breathe again, and enfold you, godlike poet, in\r\nmy arms.\"\r\n\r\nThe figures in which we are specially interested, however, are not\r\nthose in the upper or middle division of the wall, but those in the\r\nblack stripes (3), nine and ten inches wide, under the panels, in the\r\nnarrow sections (4) and in the corresponding sections of the base.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 164.--Psyches gathering flowers. Wall painting\r\n   in the house of the Vettii.]\r\n\r\nIn each of the sections at the bottom is a standing figure. In those\r\nof the end wall (5) are a satyr and a bacchante; in the two nearest\r\nthe middle of each side wall are Amazons, in the rest female figures\r\nwith implements of sacrifice. The Amazons, armed with battle-axe and\r\nshield, are full of life; they are distinguished by the colors of\r\ntheir mantles and their Phrygian caps.\r\n\r\nIn the narrow sections on the end walls (4), and all but four of the\r\nothers, were Psyches gathering flowers. Only a part of the scenes are\r\npreserved; in each are three figures, grouped with a pleasing variety\r\nand rendered with singular delicacy of touch. In one, the Psyches are\r\nsprightly children (Fig. 164); in another, young girls; and in a third\r\nwe see a lady sitting at ease and plucking the flowers close at hand,\r\nwhile two maids gather the blossoms beyond her reach.\r\n\r\nThe two narrow sections nearest the middle panel of each side wall\r\ncontained mythological scenes, of which three are preserved. The\r\nsubjects are taken from the cycle of myths relating to Apollo and\r\nArtemis. In one of the pictures both the divinities appear. Apollo\r\nhas just slain the Python, which lies coiled about the Omphalos, the\r\nsacred symbol of the god as the giver of oracles at Delphi. His bow\r\nand quiver are hanging upon a column in the background, and he moves\r\nforward with vigorous step singing the Paean with an accompaniment\r\nupon the cithara. At the right, Artemis, with a quiver and long\r\nhunting spear, leans upon a pillar looking at her brother. Nearer the\r\nOmphalos are a priest and a female attendant, with a bull intended for\r\nsacrifice; the relation of these to the rest of the scene is not clear\r\n(Plate VIII.).\r\n\r\nThe companion picture takes us to a sanctuary dedicated to Artemis. At\r\nthe left a gilt bronze image of the goddess, in hunting costume,\r\nstands upon a pillar, to the side of which a bow, quiver, and boar's\r\nhead are fastened. On one side of the round altar in the middle is a\r\nwhite hind, sacred to the goddess; on the other, moving toward it with\r\na sword in the uplifted right hand, is a kingly figure, the face\r\nturned with a wild and threatening look toward a frightened attendant;\r\nanother attendant, back of the hind, seems not yet to have noticed the\r\nsacrilegious intruder. The composition is full of dramatic power; the\r\nsubject can be none other than the slaying of the hind of Artemis by\r\nthe impious Agamemnon (Plate VIII.).\r\n\r\nThe third of these small paintings presents a scene not infrequently\r\nmet with on Pompeian walls, Orestes and Pylades at Tauris in the\r\npresence of King Thoas, and of Iphigenia, who is now a priestess of\r\nArtemis. The conception is akin to that of the painting in the house\r\nof the Citharist (Fig. 182), but the picture is partially obliterated.\r\n\r\nThe long stripe below the panels is preserved in more than half its\r\nlength, on the end wall (3), on that at the right, and on the short\r\nsections of the front wall; there is also a fragment on the left side.\r\nIt contains a series of charming pictures representing Cupids and\r\nPsyches. Some of the little creatures are engaged in sports, others\r\nare celebrating a festival, while others still are busying themselves\r\nwith the manifold work of everyday life. The execution is less careful\r\nthan in the small mythological pictures; yet the figures are so full\r\nof life, their movements are so purposeful, and their bearing so\r\nsuggestive that we seem to catch the expression of the tiny faces.\r\nThe Cupids and Psyches, whether playing the part of children or of men\r\nand women in elegant attire, whether garland makers or vinedressers or\r\nsmiths, are always Cupids and Psyches still; we instinctively\r\nrecognize them as such, not by reason of outward attributes so much as\r\nby their bearing. Prosaic daily toil has nowhere been more happily\r\nidealized.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 165.--Cupids making and selling oil. Wall painting\r\n   in the house of the Vettii.]\r\n\r\nThe Cupids at the left of the entrance are playing with a duck. One\r\nholds the duck under his arm ready to let it go; the other stretches\r\nout his hands to catch it as it tries to escape. The group on the\r\nother side are throwing at a wooden mark. One is setting up the\r\ntarget. Two are making ready to throw, one of them being mounted on\r\nthe back of a companion; the successful contestant in such games was\r\ncalled \"the king,\" the loser, \"the ass,\" because he had to carry the\r\nothers upon his back. A fifth stands ruefully beside the target,\r\nawaiting his turn to carry the victor.\r\n\r\nAmong the most attractive groups are those of the flower dealers, at\r\nthe end of the right wall near the entrance. First we see the gardener\r\nleading to market a goat laden with roses; his little son trudges\r\nalong behind the animal, carrying a basket of roses suspended from a\r\nstick on the left shoulder. Next is the dealer, who stands behind a\r\nbroad marble table covered with garlands; he is handing two to a youth\r\nwho already has several, while a Psyche near by is placing the\r\ngarlands in a basket. Beyond these, workmen are making garlands, which\r\nhang in profusion from a wooden frame. At the extreme left is a lady\r\nasking the price. One of the workmen holds up two fingers, signifying\r\ntwo asses. The price of a wreath is given in a graffito as three asses\r\n(p. 497).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 166.--Oil press. From a wall painting found at\r\n   Herculaneum.]\r\n\r\nIn the following scene Cupids appear as makers and sellers of oil\r\n(Fig. 165). At the right is the oil press. It stands upon a square\r\nstone, the upper surface of which contains a semicircular incision to\r\ncatch the oil and carry it to a round vessel standing in front. The\r\ntwo sides, each with a broad vertical opening, are securely fastened\r\nby a crosspiece at the top. The ends of four horizontal boards are\r\nfitted to the openings, in which they move up and down. The olives are\r\nplaced under the lowest board; in the spaces between the others, and\r\nbetween the upper board and the crosspiece, thick wooden wedges are\r\ndriven. As the workmen drive in the wedges with heavy mallets, the\r\npressure upon the olives is increased, and the oil is forced out. The\r\narrangement may be more plainly seen in Fig. 166, from a wall painting\r\nat Herculaneum, in which a similar press appears.\r\n\r\nAt the left of the press is a large kettle resting on a tripod. The\r\noil is being stirred as it is heated; a similar kettle appears in the\r\nscene in a shop presented in the other part of the picture. Further on\r\nare two figures beside a deep vessel, but the process represented is\r\nnot clear.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 167.--Cupids as goldsmiths. Wall painting in the\r\n   house of the Vettii.]\r\n\r\nThe rest of the picture relates to the selling of oil. In the\r\nbackground is a cupboard, with a statuette--possibly an Aphrodite--on\r\nthe upper shelf. In front is an open chest resting on four legs. Both\r\nthe cupboard and the box contain bottles and jars of various shapes\r\nand sizes for holding oil; a Cupid has just taken one up. On the top\r\nof the chest is a roll of papyrus with a pair of scales; oil was sold\r\nby weight. A memorandum on the wall of an adjoining house reads:\r\n_XIII. K. Fe. oli. p. DCCCXXXX_,--'January 20, 840 pounds of oil.'\r\n\r\nThe central figure of the group at the left is the lady who has come\r\nto make a purchase. A cushioned seat has been placed for her, with a\r\nfootstool; the maid stands motionless behind, a large fan resting on\r\nthe right shoulder. The proprietor holds in his right hand a spoon\r\ncontaining a sample which he has just taken from the jar under his\r\narm; the lady seems to be testing the quality on the back of her\r\nwrist. The article sold is doubtless the fine perfumed oil, not the\r\ncommon variety.\r\n\r\nHardly less animated are the scenes in which Cupids take the place of\r\ngoldsmiths (Fig. 167). At the right is the furnace, adorned with the\r\nhead of Hephaestus, the patron divinity of workers in metals. In front\r\nis a Cupid with a blowpipe and pincers. Behind it another is working\r\nwith a graver's tool upon a large gold vessel. The pose, suggesting at\r\nthe same time exertion and perfect steadiness, is rendered with\r\nremarkable skill.\r\n\r\nNext is a figure at a small anvil; then the counter for the sale of\r\njewellery, which is displayed in three open drawers. Behind the case\r\ncontaining the drawers a large and a smaller pair of scales are seen.\r\n\r\nThe first two figures in the other half of the picture represent a\r\nlady purchaser, seated, and the proprietor, who weighs out an object\r\nwith a small pair of scales. The left hands of both point to the\r\nbalance; they are deeply interested in the weighing. Lastly, we see\r\ntwo figures at an anvil. Nothing could be more natural than the pose\r\nof the one at the left, holding the metal upon the anvil for his\r\ncompanion to strike, yet drawing back as far as possible in order to\r\navoid the sparks.\r\n\r\nThe processes of the fullery also are illustrated,--treading the\r\nclothes in vats, carding, inspection of the cloth to see if the work\r\nis properly done, and folding the finished garments for delivery to\r\nthe owners.\r\n\r\nThree of the pictures--two on the end wall and one on the left\r\nside--relate to wine.\r\n\r\nThe first is a vintage scene (Fig. 168), of which only a part is\r\ndistinct. At the left is a Cupid gathering grapes, from vines trained\r\nto run from tree to tree. The press is worked on a different principle\r\nfrom the one shown in Fig. 165. Here two Cupids are turning a windlass\r\nby means of long levers. The windlass is connected by a pulley with a\r\npress beam above; as the end of this is gradually lowered, the\r\npressure upon the grapes underneath is increased.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 168.--Vintage scene: Cupids gathering and pressing\r\n   grapes. Wall painting in the house of the Vettii.]\r\n\r\nThe triumph of Bacchus is presented in another picture, which is\r\nfortunately in a better state of preservation. At the head of the\r\nprocession is a bacchante, riding on a panther. Bacchus sits in a\r\nfour-wheeled chariot drawn by goats; the coachman is a satyr. Behind\r\nthe triumphal car is Pan, dancing and playing the double flute; last\r\ncomes a vine-crowned Cupid, dancing, with a large mixing bowl upon his\r\nshoulder. The skill shown in the pose of the dancing figures is\r\nespecially noteworthy; they stand lightly erect, seeming not to feel\r\ntheir weight or the exertion of rapid movement.\r\n\r\nIn the last of this series, upon the left wall, Cupids appear as wine\r\ndealers; the part of the picture that has been preserved is shown in\r\nFig. 169. The rustic bearing of the seller, at the left, is in\r\npleasing contrast with the free and graceful carriage of the well-bred\r\nbuyer, to whom he is handing a sample of the wine in a cup. At the\r\nright two servants are drawing another sample from an amphora; one\r\ntips the amphora so cautiously that the other, who is holding the\r\nbowl, presses the neck gently with his left hand in order to make the\r\nslender stream flow faster.\r\n\r\nRapidity of movement reaches a climax in the middle picture of the\r\nright wall, which represents the games of the Circus. The scene is\r\nlaid in the country; each goal is marked by three trees. Antelopes\r\ntake the place of horses, and the groups are conceived with wonderful\r\nrealism. The tiny, fluttering garments of the drivers display the\r\ncolors of the four parties,--green, red, white, and blue.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 169. Cupids as dealers in wine. Wall painting in\r\n   the house of the Vettii.]\r\n\r\nTwo of the pictures on the end wall are so damaged that it is not easy\r\nto make out the details. One of them, like that just described,\r\npresents a purely Roman subject--the festival of Vesta (Fig. 170).\r\nCupids and Psyches are reclining at ease about a serving table in the\r\nshape of a deep platter with two handles, on which drinking vessels\r\nare seen; in the background are two asses, sacred to Vesta (p. 98).\r\nSome, at least, of the Cupid pictures could not have been taken from\r\nGreek originals.\r\n\r\nIn the atrium also there was a black stripe containing Cupids similar\r\nto those already described, but the figures are not so well preserved.\r\nThe most interesting scene represents a sacrifice to Fortuna. Cupids\r\nappear also riding and driving. Some are mounted on goats and engaged\r\nin a contest. One stands on a crab, guiding the ungainly creature with\r\nreins and plying the whip; another is similarly mounted on a lobster.\r\nA few are in chariots, the chariot in one case being drawn by two\r\ndolphins.\r\n\r\nIn each division of the wall of the atrium near the bottom is the\r\nhalf-length figure of a child, painted on a dark red ground. The\r\nchildren are busied with vessels of all kinds, apparently intended for\r\nsacrifice. The seriousness of their task, the importance which they\r\nattach to their helpfulness, is finely expressed in the faces, which\r\nare individualized in the manner of a true artist.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 170.--Cupids celebrating the festival of Vesta.\r\n   Wall painting in the house of the Vettii.]\r\n\r\nWe may dismiss the later paintings of the house with few words. In the\r\nfauces (_b_) are small monochrome panels containing a pair of deer, a\r\ncock fight, vases, and a wallet with a herald's staff, attributes of\r\nMercury, who perhaps had a place among the Penates of the house.\r\n\r\nIn the room at the left of the atrium (_e_) is a painting of\r\nCyparissus, the youth beloved of Apollo, with his wounded deer on the\r\nground near him; in another part of the room is the wrestling match\r\nbetween Pan and Eros. Among the figures seen in the architectural\r\nframework of the upper division of the wall is Zeus, sitting on his\r\nthrone, represented as a youth, unbearded; Leda with the swan also\r\nappears, and Danae holding out her robe to catch the golden rain.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the owner's tastes is perhaps indicated by a painting\r\nin the peristyle, at the middle of the wall under the colonnade at the\r\nleft. It contains a portrait, probably of an author; near by is a\r\nmanuscript case with rolls of papyrus.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE IX.--A DINING ROOM IN THE HOUSE OF THE VETTII]\r\n\r\nThe paintings in the two dining rooms opening on the peristyle, _n_\r\nand _p_, are in a better state of preservation than those of any other\r\npart of the house. In the first room, _n_, the simple and restful\r\ndecoration surrounding the large pictures is in striking contrast with\r\nthe pictures themselves, one of which is placed at the middle of each\r\nof the three walls. Here we see the infant Hercules strangling the\r\nserpents, there Pentheus and the Maenads about to tear him in pieces;\r\nthe subject of the third painting is the punishment of Dirce, the\r\ntreatment being not unlike that of the sculptured Farnese group in the\r\nNaples Museum.\r\n\r\nThe decorative effect of the other room, _p_, is more harmonious. The\r\ndivisions of the wall space, the relation of the three principal\r\npaintings to the decorative design, and the distribution of ornament\r\nare indicated in our illustration (Plate IX); but no reproduction can\r\ndo justice to the richness of the coloring.\r\n\r\nThe painting in the middle panel at the right brings before us Bacchus\r\nwith his train as they come upon the sleeping Ariadne. On the left\r\nwall opposite is Daedalus, pointing out the wooden cow that he has\r\nmade to Pasiphae, who hands to him a golden arm band. The subject of\r\nthe third picture is here met with for the first time at Pompeii--the\r\npunishment of Ixion.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy of the scene (Fig. 171) is plainly suggested, but not\r\nforced upon the beholder; we see, at the left, only half of the ever\r\nrevolving wheel to which the wretched victim is bound. The other\r\nfigures are more prominent and, with one exception, convey no\r\nsuggestion of pain or sympathy in either pose or expression of face.\r\nNearest the wheel is Hephaestus, who has just fastened Ixion upon it;\r\nhis pincers, hammer, and anvil are lying upon the ground in the\r\ncorner. In front of him is Hermes, who, in obedience to the command of\r\nZeus, brought the offender to the place of punishment.\r\n\r\nA sad-faced female figure with veiled head sits in the foreground--a\r\npersonification of the spirit of one who has died, a shade introduced\r\nto indicate that the place of punishment is the Underworld. The left\r\nhand is involuntarily raised with the shock that the thought of the\r\nvictim's suffering brings; the face has been thought by some to\r\nresemble that often given to the Madonna.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 171.--The punishment of Ixion. Wall painting in\r\n   the house of the Vettii.]\r\n\r\nThe two figures at the right of the picture are of the upper world,\r\nnot directly connected with the main action, yet well conceived and\r\nskilfully introduced. Nearer the foreground Hera sits enthroned, her\r\nsceptre in her left hand; behind her stands Iris, faithful messenger,\r\nwho points out to her the well deserved fate of him who dared to offer\r\nan affront to the queen of heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\n_THREE HOUSES OF UNUSUAL PLAN_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the houses described in the preceding chapters the distribution of\r\nthe rooms is characterized by a certain regularity, which makes it\r\npossible to indicate the arrangements by reference to an ideal or\r\nnormal plan. A wide departure, however, is occasionally noted; and by\r\nway of illustration three houses of unusual plan will be briefly\r\npresented here, first a house without an atrium, then one having an\r\natrium but no compluvium, and, lastly, a large establishment built on\r\nterraces at different levels.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE HOUSE OF ACCEPTUS AND EUHODIA\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 172.--The House of Acceptus and Euhodia.\r\n\r\n     _a._ Colonnade.\r\n     _b._ Garden.\r\n     _c._ Kitchen.\r\n     _d._ Bedroom.\r\n     _f._ Dining room.\r\n     _g._ Garden.\r\n     _i._ Bedroom with places for two beds.]\r\n\r\nSometimes a few rooms of a large house were cut off from the atrium\r\nand used as a separate dwelling; the original plan in such cases is\r\neasily determined. The number of houses built without an atrium in the\r\nbeginning is exceedingly small. Among the pleasantest was the modest\r\ndwelling of Acceptus and Euhodia, on the south side of the double\r\nInsula in the eighth Region (VIII. v.-vi. 39); the names are taken\r\nfrom a couple of election notices painted on the front, in which they\r\nappear together.\r\n\r\nFrom the street one passed directly under a colonnade (Fig. 172, _a_)\r\nin two stories, facing a small garden (_b_), from which it was\r\nseparated by a low wall. At one end of the garden was an open-air\r\ntriclinium (_k_), which still remains. The rest of the plot, used as a\r\nflower garden, was profusely ornamented; five heads of herms, a frog\r\nand other objects of marble were found in it, besides a couple of\r\nalabaster basins and five statuettes of Egyptian divinities made of\r\nglazed pottery. In the corner of the colonnade, between the garden and\r\nthe entrance, is a small hearth, conveniently placed for serving the\r\nopen-air triclinium; in the opposite corner at the left the excavators\r\nfound the remains of a cupboard, together with vessels of bronze,\r\nglass, and clay. At the further end of the colonnade one passed into\r\nanother small garden (_g_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 173.--Longitudinal section of the house of\r\n   Acceptus and Euhodia, restored.]\r\n\r\nA bedroom (_d_) opened on the colonnade near the entrance. A corridor\r\n(_e_) led to the kitchen (_c_) behind it. Beyond the corridor is the\r\ndining room (_f_). Another sleeping room (_i_) with places for two\r\nbeds is entered through a kind of anteroom (_h_) at the rear of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe rooms of the second story corresponded closely with those\r\nunderneath, and were entered from the second story of the colonnade;\r\nthe stairs, partly of wood, started in the kitchen. The appearance of\r\nthe house as one looked from the garden at the right toward the\r\ncolonnade may be inferred from our restoration, which gives a\r\nlongitudinal section (Fig. 173); the letters under the section refer\r\nto the rooms as they are indicated in the plan.\r\n\r\nThe house was decorated in the fourth style. On the south wall of the\r\nkitchen there is a painting of Fortuna, with the usual attributes, a\r\ncornucopia and a rudder resting on a ball. The Genius and the Lares\r\nnowhere appear, and as a lotus blossom is painted on the forehead of\r\nthe goddess, who is thus conceived of as a form of Isis, we may\r\nsuppose that Acceptus and his wife were adherents of the Egyptian\r\ncult. Besides the statuettes of Egyptian divinities there was found in\r\nthe garden the foot of a marble table with a Greek inscription \"of\r\nSerapion,\" an Egyptian name. Acceptus and Euhodia may have come from\r\nAlexandria and thence have introduced into Pompeii this type of house,\r\nso unlike the native form. The Latin name of Acceptus does not stand\r\nin the way of this explanation, for he was probably a freedman, who in\r\nEgypt may have had a Roman master.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. A HOUSE WITHOUT A COMPLUVIUM\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 174.--Plan of a house without a compluvium (V. v.\r\n   2).\r\n\r\n     _a._ Shop.\r\n     _b._ Fauces.\r\n     _e._ Atrium.\r\n     _f._ Light court.\r\n     _k._ Dining room.\r\n     1. Hearth.\r\n     2. Cistern curb.]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying plan (Fig. 174) shows the arrangement of a small\r\nhouse on the north side of Nola Street in the fifth Region (V. v. 2).\r\nThe problem of lighting the atrium (_e_), the roof of which sloped\r\ntoward the back, was met in a simple way.\r\n\r\nAt the rear a light court (_f_) was constructed, which furnished light\r\nand air by means of broad windows, not only to the atrium, but also to\r\nthe adjoining room _g_ and indirectly to the dining room _k_, which\r\nhad a window opening on _g_.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement, however, is in part the result of later changes.\r\nOriginally the room marked _g_ belonged to the court, _f_, and the\r\nhouse consisted of two parts, separated by a narrow area. The kitchen\r\nwas then in the low room (_i_) above which was a correspondingly low\r\nchamber, the height of the two rooms being only equal to that of the\r\ndining room (_k_). In later times, however, the hearth was moved to\r\nthe corner of the atrium (1), the smoke being let out through a small\r\nwindow in the wall. A stairway, partly of wood, led to the upper rooms\r\nat the front of the house. Along the street ran a stone bench,\r\nprotected by a roof projecting over it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 175.--Transverse section of the house without a\r\n   compluvium.\r\n\r\n   At the left, light court (_f_), with stairs (_h_) leading to an upper\r\n   room over _i_. At the right, room _g_, with the window opening into\r\n   the dining room _k_.]\r\n\r\nThe water from the roofs fell into the light court _f_, and was\r\ncollected in a cistern. We give a transverse section across _f_ and\r\n_g_ (Fig. 175), showing the arrangement of the roofs, doors, and\r\nwindow at the rear.\r\n\r\nOn the wall of _g_ is scratched the inscription, _Fures foras, frugi\r\nintro_,--'Let thieves keep out, let honest folk come in!'\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE HOUSE OF THE EMPEROR JOSEPH II\r\n\r\nA good example of a house extended over terraces at different levels\r\nmay be seen on the edge of the hill west of the Forum Triangulare\r\n(VIII. ii. 39), that of the Emperor Joseph II, casa dell' Imperatore\r\nGiuseppe II. The name was given in commemoration of a visit of this\r\nemperor to Pompeii, in 1769, when a special excavation in his honor\r\nwas made in a part of the house.\r\n\r\nThe uppermost of the three terraces on which the house is built (Fig.\r\n176, 1) is at the level of the street (Vico della Regina, Plan VI),\r\nthe lowest (3) in part occupies the place of the old city wall; the\r\nmiddle terrace is adjusted to the intervening slope. The arrangement\r\nof the stairways between the terraces and the distribution of the\r\nrooms may be more easily understood from an inspection of the plan in\r\nconnection with the key below than from description.\r\n\r\nThere was a second story over a part of the rooms on the upper\r\nterrace, as indicated by the stairways at _e_ and _n_ and in the\r\ncorner of _u_, but the extent of it is not easy to determine. The\r\ntraces of the upper rooms of the middle terrace, however, are clearly\r\nseen, and their arrangement is indicated on the plan (4); the height\r\nof [theta] and [kappa], which were in one story, was equal to that of\r\nthe smaller rooms with the chambers above.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 176.--Plan of the house of the Emperor Joseph II.\r\n\r\n     1.

Room over [zeta], connected with V (over [gamma], [delta]) by a\r\n          gallery over the stairway [epsilon], and with [eta] by a ladder\r\n          or stairway.]\r\n\r\nThe front of the house, the large Tuscan atrium with the adjoining\r\nrooms, dates from the Tufa Period; the atrium was originally one of\r\nthe most richly decorated at Pompeii. The rooms back of the atrium\r\nopening toward the rear, and those of the middle and lower terraces,\r\nare a later addition, built after the city wall at this point had\r\nbeen removed, perhaps not long before the end of the Republic; traces\r\nof the second style of decoration are found in one of the lowest\r\nrooms, the tepidarium of the bath. Remains of the first style are\r\nfound in the fauces, but the greater part of the house is decorated in\r\nthe last style.\r\n\r\nOne of the small rooms (_c_) opening on the atrium, originally a\r\nbedroom, was in later times turned into a house chapel. In the right\r\nwall is a small niche, on the back of which a Genius of the ordinary\r\ntype is painted. Near him and also offering a libation is a female\r\nfigure with the attributes of Juno, a diadem, and a sceptre. The two\r\nfigures represent the Genii of the master and mistress of the house\r\n(p. 270). Under the niche, and at the sides are iron nails, driven\r\ninto the plaster to hold wreaths and garlands.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 177.--Corner of bake room in the lowest story of\r\n   the house of the Emperor Joseph II, at the time of excavation.]\r\n\r\nOn either side of the broad middle room (_w_) is a dining room (_v_,\r\n_x_), connected with it by two large windows. All three rooms open\r\nupon the colonnade (_y_), and this again opens out upon a terrace\r\n(_z_).\r\n\r\nThe principal room of the middle story (2. [eta], under _z_) takes the\r\nplace of an atrium; it is lighted by a door and two windows opening upon\r\na terrace ([mu]). Connected with it are two dining rooms ([theta],\r\n[kappa]), considerably higher than the other apartments of this story,\r\nand three sleeping rooms ([iota], [lambda], [zeta]). A dark corridor\r\n([beta]) separated these rooms from the solid earth at the rear, and\r\nfurnished access, by means of ladders, to two low upper rooms (over\r\n[iota] and [lambda]; see 4. II, III), perhaps used as storerooms. From\r\n[beta] one could also reach, in the same way, an oblong chamber\r\nexcavated in the earth (I), designed originally as a cistern, but used\r\nas a cellar at the time of the eruption. Of the remaining upper rooms\r\none (IV) was built on the solid ground at the side of the stairway\r\nleading from the upper floor ([alpha]); the other two (V, over [gamma],\r\n[delta] and VI, over [zeta]) were connected by a gallery or bridge over\r\nthe stairway leading to the lower floor ([epsilon]); this gallery could\r\nbe reached also by a ladder or wooden stairway in the large middle room\r\n([eta]). The outermost room (VI) was perhaps a washroom; there is a\r\nrectangular basin in one corner.\r\n\r\nThe lower floor was given up to a bath (_frigidarium_, 8;\r\n_tepidarium_, 6; _caldarium_, 7) and to a bakery (3, 4).\r\n\r\nIn the vaulted ceiling of the frigidarium (8) and one of the rooms of\r\nthe bakery (3) is a round hole for ventilation, opening upon the\r\nterrace above through a kind of chimney. The hollow walls of the\r\ncaldarium (7) are carried to the crown of the vault, at the middle of\r\nwhich is a similar opening for the vent. The places of the three\r\nopenings in the floor of the terrace are seen in the plan (2, mu).\r\n\r\nAt one end of the larger room of the bakery (3) is the oven; at the\r\nother two rectangular basins of masonry. In the corner near the basins\r\nwas found the skeleton of a man who at the time of the eruption had\r\ntaken refuge in this room and probably died of hunger. The appearance\r\nof the room at the time of excavation is shown in a sketch published\r\nby Mazois (Fig. 177).\r\n\r\nThe door near the corner, seen in the illustration, led outside the\r\ncity. The proprietor of the house perhaps had a special permit\r\nenabling him to leave or enter the city at any time without\r\nsurveillance; none of the other houses along the edge of the city have\r\na private entrance of this kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\n_OTHER NOTEWORTHY HOUSES_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe houses accorded a detailed description in the previous chapters\r\nare few in comparison with the number of those worthy of special\r\nstudy. He alone who has wandered day after day among the ruins,\r\nreturning again and again to explore the parts of the city which are\r\nrarely seen by the hasty visitor, can realize what a wealth of\r\ninteresting material lies behind the barren walls lining the streets\r\non either side.\r\n\r\nThe location of the houses mentioned incidentally is given in Plan VI,\r\nat the end of the volume. Such are, the house of Caecilius Jucundus,\r\non Stabian Street (V. i. 26), the tablinum of which contains one of\r\nthe most beautiful specimens of wall decoration yet discovered, in the\r\nthird style; the house of Lucretius, on the same street (IX. iii. 5),\r\nwith a little garden behind the tablinum adorned with quaint\r\nsculptures; the house of the Hunt on Nola Street (VII. iv. 48), so\r\nnamed from the large hunting scene on the wall at the rear of the\r\ngarden; and further down on Nola Street (IX. vii. 6) the extensive\r\nhouse with three atriums and a large peristyle, excavated in 1879,\r\neighteen centuries after the destruction of the city, and hence called\r\nthe house of the Centenary, casa del Centenario.\r\n\r\nIn the same block with the house of the Hunt, opposite that of the\r\nFaun, is the house of the Sculptured Capitals, casa dei Capitelli\r\nFigurati (VII. iv. 57). It received its name from the figures carved\r\nin the tufa capitals of the pilasters at the entrance, one of which is\r\nshown in Fig. 178; the stucco with which the surface was coated has\r\nnow fallen off. Such figures are not infrequently met with in pilaster\r\ncapitals of the Tufa Period, the subjects being always taken, as here,\r\nfrom the bacchic cycle; the satyr at the left is well rendered. The\r\nplan of the house is simple, like that of other houses of moderate\r\nsize dating from the pre-Roman time.\r\n\r\nNear the west end of Nola Street is the house of Pansa, which occupies\r\nthe whole of the sixth Insula of Region VI. Although of approximately\r\nthe same size as the house of the Faun, and built in the same period,\r\nit contained fewer large rooms; its proportions were less impressive,\r\nits finish less elegant. The walls present many evidences of repairs\r\nand alterations, but of the wall decoration nothing remains.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 178.--Capital of pilaster at the entrance of the\r\n   house of the Sculptured Capitals.]\r\n\r\nThe plan (Fig. 179) is of interest on account of its regularity. It\r\nwell illustrates the extent to which, at Pompeii, rooms not required\r\nfor household purposes were utilized as shops and small separate\r\ndwellings, which were rented to tenants, and doubtless formed an\r\nimportant source of income.\r\n\r\nThe vestibule and fauces have been mentioned previously (p. 249). The\r\nliving rooms are grouped about a single atrium (2) and a large\r\nperistyle (9). A colonnade at the rear of the house faces the garden,\r\nwhich, as indicated by the appearance of the ground at the time of\r\nexcavation, was used for vegetables. Opening on the colonnade is the\r\ngardener's room (_a_).\r\n\r\nIn the front were shops, one of which (35) was connected with the\r\nhouse and served as the proprietor's place of business; another (33)\r\nwas used as a salesroom for the bakery, which occupied the rooms\r\nnumbered 28-34. On the same side of the house were three small\r\ntwo-story dwellings, one of which (22-23) contained windows opening\r\ninto an adjoining room (12) of the house and into the peristyle; it\r\nwas doubtless occupied by some one connected with the household. The\r\ndwellings on the other street (A, B, C) were larger. Fiorelli thought\r\nthat this Insula belonged to Alleius Nigidius Maius (p. 489); the name\r\nof Pansa was given to it from an election notice painted on the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 179.--Plan of the house of Pansa.\r\n\r\n     1.

Separate dwellings.]\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkable group of houses near the north end of Mercury\r\nStreet. The first in importance is the house of Castor and Pollux (VI.\r\nix. 6), which is so named from the figures of the Dioscuri, holding\r\ntheir horses by the bridle, painted on the walls of the principal\r\nfauces. Between the two atriums, one of which is of the Corinthian\r\ntype, lies a large peristyle; and behind the Corinthian atrium is a\r\ngarden with a colonnade in front. The decoration of the house is\r\nespecially effective; that of the larger tablinum was by one of the\r\nbest artists who worked at Pompeii. The paintings in the two central\r\npanels of this room are often mentioned; on the right wall, the\r\nrecognition of Achilles among the daughters of Lycomedes; on the left,\r\nthe quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon. The representation of\r\nVenus Pompeiana shown in Fig. 4 is from the peristyle.\r\n\r\nBeyond the house of Castor and Pollux is that of the Centaur (VI. ix.\r\n3), which received its name from a painting in which Hercules,\r\nDeianira, and Nessus appear; the end of a bedroom in this house is\r\nshown in Fig. 122. The rest of the insula belongs to the large house\r\nof Meleager, named from a picture representing Meleager and Atalanta.\r\nThe walls contained numerous mythological pictures, part of which were\r\ntransferred to the Naples Museum; those left on the walls have\r\nsuffered from exposure to the weather.\r\n\r\nThe house of Apollo also (VI. vii. 23), on the opposite side of the\r\nstreet, is noteworthy on account of its decoration, in the last style;\r\nthe god appears in a series of paintings. Two houses in the next\r\ninsula, on the south, have in their gardens fountain niches veneered\r\nwith bright mosaics, the casa della Fontana Grande (VI. viii. 22) and\r\nthe casa della Fontana Piccola (VI. viii. 23).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 180.--Section showing a part of the peristyle of\r\n   the house of the Anchor, restored.]\r\n\r\nAt the middle of the tenth Insula, in the same Region, is the house of\r\nthe Anchor (VI. x. 7), so called from an anchor outlined in the black\r\nand white mosaic of the fauces. The peristyle here presents an\r\ninteresting peculiarity of construction. The level of the street at\r\nthe rear of the house was below that of Mercury Street. Instead of\r\nfilling up the lot so as to raise the garden to the height of the\r\nfront part, the builder constructed a kind of basement under the\r\ncolonnade of the peristyle, the floor of which was thus adjusted to\r\nthe level of the floors in the front rooms; the garden and the floor\r\nof the basement were on the same level as the street at the rear. The\r\ncolonnade was higher on the north than on the other three sides (Fig.\r\n180). The effect of the whole was far from unpleasing. Whether the\r\nprojections seen in the niches below, at the level of the garden, are\r\npedestals or small altars cannot be determined. The niches at the\r\nfront end were made larger, and were three in number. In the middle\r\nniche was a diminutive temple; the other two had the form of an apse,\r\nand contained fountain figures.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 181.--Plan of the house of the Citharist.\r\n\r\n     6. West atrium with connecting rooms, entered from Stabian Street.\r\n     17, 32. Peristyles belonging with the west atrium.\r\n     40, 41. Bath--tepidarium and caldarium.\r\n     42. Kitchen.\r\n     47. North atrium, entered from the continuation of Abbondanza Street.\r\n     56. Peristyle belonging with the north atrium.]\r\n\r\nHouses were sometimes enlarged at the expense of neighboring\r\ndwellings, which, in some cases, were destroyed to the foundations, in\r\nothers remodelled or incorporated with slight change. An example is\r\nthe house of the Citharist, which fills the greater part of the fourth\r\nInsula in Region I, on the east side of Stabian Street. A bronze\r\nstatue of Apollo playing the cithara, found in the middle peristyle\r\n(Fig. 181, 17), gave its name to the house. It is apparently a\r\nfaithful copy of a Greek masterpiece at Sparta, and is now in the\r\nNaples Museum. The house is sometimes referred to as that of Popidius\r\nSecundus.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 182.--Orestes and Pylades before King Thoas.\r\n   Wall painting from the house of the Citharist.]\r\n\r\nThere are two atriums (6, 47) and three peristyles (17, 32, 56). A\r\nlarge part of the house, the west atrium (6), with the connecting\r\nrooms and the two peristyles, 17 and 32, was built in the Tufa Period,\r\nin the place of several older houses. The rooms east of the two\r\nperistyles, and the north atrium (47) and peristyle (56), with the\r\nadjoining rooms, were added in Roman times, probably near the end of\r\nthe Republic; the house was afterwards decorated in the second style.\r\nRemains of the third and fourth styles also are found in some parts of\r\nthe house. The better apartments are grouped about the peristyles; the\r\nrooms about the atriums were turned over to the slaves or used for\r\ndomestic purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the large room (35) opening on the south peristyle were two\r\npaintings of unusual merit, both of which were transferred to the\r\nNaples Museum. The subject of one was the finding of the deserted\r\nAriadne by Bacchus; in the other Orestes and Pylades appear as\r\ncaptives before Thoas, the king of Tauris (Fig. 182).\r\n\r\nAt the right of the picture sits Thoas, looking at the captives, his\r\nsword lying across his knees, his hands resting upon the end of his\r\nsceptre. Behind him stands a guard with a long spear in the right\r\nhand. Another guard with two spears stands behind Orestes and Pylades,\r\nwhose hands are bound. Orestes, upon whose head is a wreath of laurel,\r\nlooks downward, an expression of sadness and resignation upon his\r\nfinely chiselled features. Pylades is not without anxiety, but is\r\nalert and hopeful. Between the two groups is an altar on which incense\r\nis burning. In the background Iphigenia is seen moving slowly forward;\r\nthe head is entirely obliterated. It is unfortunate that the painting\r\nis so badly preserved. The faces of the two youths are individualized\r\nwith remarkable skill, and the picture here used as the centre of a\r\ndecorative framework of the fourth style is evidently a copy of a\r\nmasterpiece.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of Abbondanza Street, opposite the Stabian Baths, is\r\nthe house of Cornelius Rufus (VIII. iv. 15), a view of the interior of\r\nwhich has already been given. The name of the proprietor is known from\r\nthe dedication on the herm (seen in Fig. 121), _C. Cornelio Rufo_; the\r\ncarved table supports behind the impluvium are among the finest yet\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nIn the same block is the house of Marcus Holconius (VIII. iv. 4), a\r\ngood example of a house completely restored and decorated after the\r\nearthquake of 63. The right ala was fitted up with shelves, on which\r\nat the time of the eruption were kitchen vessels of bronze, iron, and\r\nterra cotta. The colonnade about the peristyle was in two stories.\r\nFrom the columns at the front six jets of water, at a height of about\r\nfour feet, fell forward into the gutter; and there was an equal number\r\nat the rear. There was also a little fountain in the exedra at the\r\nrear of the peristyle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\n_ROMAN VILLAS.--THE VILLA OF DIOMEDES_\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo classes of villas were distinguished by the Romans,--the country\r\nseat, _villa pseudourbana_, and the farmhouse, _villa rustica_. The\r\nformer was a city house, adapted to rural conditions; the arrangements\r\nof the latter were determined by the requirements of farm life.\r\n\r\nThe country seats manifested a greater diversity of plan than the city\r\nresidences. They were relatively larger, containing spacious\r\ncolonnades and gardens; as the proprietor was unrestricted in regard\r\nto space, not being confined to the limits of a lot, fuller\r\nopportunity was afforded for the display of individual taste in the\r\narrangement of rooms. We can understand from the letters of Pliny the\r\nYounger, describing his two villas at Laurentum and Tifernum Tiberinum\r\n(now Citta di Castello), and from the remains of the villa of Hadrian\r\nat Tivoli, how far individuality might assert itself in the planning\r\nand building of a country home.\r\n\r\nThe main entrance of a country seat, according to Vitruvius, should\r\nlead directly to a peristyle; one or more atriums might be placed\r\nfurther back. The living rooms would be grouped about the central\r\nspaces in the way that would best suit the configuration of the ground\r\nand meet the wishes of the owner. In farmhouses there would naturally\r\nbe a court near the entrance; and the hearth, as we have seen, down to\r\nthe latest times, was placed in the room that corresponded with the\r\natrium of the city house. In most parts of Italy a large farmhouse\r\nwould contain appliances for making wine and oil.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the two types of country house in the vicinity of\r\nPompeii may be briefly illustrated by reference to an example of each,\r\nthe villa of Diomedes and the farmhouse recently excavated at\r\nBoscoreale.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 183.--Plan of the villa of Diomedes.\r\n\r\n     1.

Rooms.\r\n     _r._ Fish pond.\r\n     _s._ Arbor.]\r\n\r\nThe location of the villa of Diomedes, beyond the last group of tombs\r\nat the left of the road leading from the Herculaneum Gate, is\r\nindicated in Plan V. An extensive establishment similar in character,\r\nthe so-called villa of Cicero, lies nearer the Gate on the same side\r\nof the road; on the right there is a third villa, of which only a\r\nsmall part has been uncovered. The three seem to have belonged to a\r\nseries of country seats situated on the ridge that extends back from\r\nPompeii in the direction of Vesuvius. The villa of Diomedes, excavated\r\nin 1771-74, received its name from the tomb of Marcus Arrius Diomedes,\r\nfacing the entrance, on the opposite side of the Street of Tombs (Plan\r\nV, 42).\r\n\r\nThe front of the villa forms a sharp angle with the street. The\r\norientation of the building was determined by an abrupt descent in the\r\nground, which runs across the middle and divides it into two parts.\r\nThe front part, the rooms of which are numbered on the plan (Fig.\r\n183), is a few feet above the level of the street at the entrance. The\r\nrear portion, as may be seen from our section (Fig. 184), is\r\nconsiderably lower; on the plan the rooms of this portion are\r\ndesignated by letters. From traces of the second style of decoration\r\nfound in two of the rooms, and from the character of the masonry, we\r\ninfer that the villa was built in Roman times, but before the reign of\r\nAugustus.\r\n\r\nIn front of the door was a narrow porch (Fig. 184). The door opened\r\ndirectly into the peristyle (3 on the plan), in the middle of which was\r\na garden. At the left is a small triangular court (17) containing a\r\nswimming tank ([zeta]) and a hearth ([epsilon]) on which a kettle and\r\nseveral pots were found; the Romans partook of warm refreshments after a\r\nbath. The wall back of the swimming tank was in part decorated with a\r\ngarden scene, not unlike those in the frigidariums of the two older\r\npublic baths. Over the tank was a roof supported by two columns, and on\r\nthe other two sides of the court there was a low but well proportioned\r\ncolonnade.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements of the bath were unusually complete, comprising an\r\napodyterium (19), a tepidarium (20), and a caldarium (21), from which\r\nthe tepidarium was warmed by means of an opening in the wall; the\r\ncaldarium had a hollow floor and walls, and was heated from the\r\nkitchen (22). In the tepidarium were found four panes of glass about\r\n101/2 inches square, together with the remains of the wooden frame in\r\nwhich they were set. The caldarium, like those of the public baths,\r\nhad a bath basin and a semicircular niche for the labrum.\r\n\r\nA small oven stands on one end of the hearth in the kitchen, and a\r\nstone table is built against the wall on the long side. The room in\r\nthe corner (23) was used as a reservoir for water, which was brought\r\ninto it by means of a feed pipe and thence distributed through smaller\r\npipes leading to the bath rooms and other parts of the house.\r\n\r\nAt the left of the peristyle is a passage (15) leading to a garden\r\nwhich has not yet been excavated. The only apartment of special\r\ninterest in this portion of the house is the semicircular sleeping\r\nroom (14) built out into the garden. It faced the south, and had three\r\nlarge windows; it was separated from the rest of the house by an\r\nanteroom, _procoeton_ (13), at one end of which is a small division\r\n([beta]) designed for the bed of an attendant. In the semicircular\r\nroom are an alcove for a bed ([gamma]) and a stationary wash bowl\r\nof masonry ([delta]). The plan is similar to that of a bedroom in\r\nPliny's villa at Laurentum. Another sleeping room (9) was provided\r\nwith both a large and a small door (p. 261).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 184.--Longitudinal section of the villa of\r\n   Diomedes, restored.\r\n\r\n     Promenade on the roof of the colonnade\r\n     Terrace\r\n     Colonnade facing the terrace\r\n     Right arm of colonnade (_g_, _h_)\r\n     Front of colonnade (_d_)\r\n     Room under the terrace (_i_)\r\n     Tablinum\r\n     Peristyle\r\n     Entrance]\r\n\r\nThe large room (8) at the rear of the peristyle may be loosely called\r\na tablinum; it could be closed at the rear. Back of the tablinum was\r\noriginally a colonnade (26), which was later turned into a corridor,\r\nwith rooms at either end; the original form is assumed in our\r\nrestoration. Beyond the colonnade was a broad terrace (28) extending\r\nto the edge of the garden. It commanded a magnificent view of Stabiae,\r\nthe coast in the direction of Sorrento, and the Bay. Connected with it\r\nwas an unroofed promenade over the colonnade (_e_, _f_, _g_, _h_)\r\nsurrounding the large garden below. A rectangular room (27, indicated\r\non the plan but not in the restoration) was afterwards built on the\r\nterrace.\r\n\r\nMembers of the family could pass into the lower portion of the villa by\r\nmeans of a stairway, at _b_; the slaves could use a long corridor (_a_),\r\nwhich was more directly connected with the domestic apartments. The flat\r\nroof of the quadrangular colonnade (_e_, _f_, _g_, _h_) was carried on\r\nthe outside by a wall, on the inside by square pillars (Fig. 184). The\r\nrooms (_i_, _k_) opening into the front of the colonnade were vaulted,\r\nand the decoration, in the last style, is well preserved; the ceiling of\r\nthe corner rooms (_l_, _m_) is flat, and the decoration of one of them\r\n(_l_) is noteworthy; green and red stars are painted on a white ground.\r\nIn the narrow space between _i_ and _c_ a cistern was built, from which\r\nwater could be drawn by means of a faucet in front.\r\n\r\nAt the opposite corners of the colonnade were two airy garden rooms\r\n(_n_, _o_). Outside of the left arm (_e_, _f_) was a broad walk (_u_),\r\nat the upper end of which were steps leading to the garden above.\r\n\r\nThe garden enclosed by the colonnade was planted with trees, charred\r\nremains of which were found at the time of excavation. In the middle\r\nwas a fish pond (_r_), in which was a fountain. Back of it was a\r\nplatform, over which vines were trained on a framework supported by\r\nsix columns, making a pleasant arbor in which meals were doubtless\r\noften served.\r\n\r\nThe door at the rear of the garden led into the fields. Near it were\r\nfound the skeletons of two men. One of them had a large key, doubtless\r\nthe key of this door; he wore a gold ring on his finger, and was\r\ncarrying a considerable sum of money--ten gold and eighty-eight silver\r\ncoins. He was probably the master of the house who had started out,\r\naccompanied by a single slave, in order to find means of escape.\r\n\r\nThe floor of the three sides of the colonnade was a few feet higher\r\nthan that of the front. Underneath was a wine cellar, lighted by small\r\nwindows in the wall on the side of the garden; it contained a large\r\nnumber of amphorae.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the eruption many members of the family took refuge in\r\nthe cellar. Here were found the skeletons of eighteen adults and two\r\nchildren: at the time of excavation the impressions of their bodies,\r\nand in some instances traces of the clothing, could be seen in the\r\nhardened ashes. Among the women was one adorned with two necklaces and\r\ntwo arm bands, besides four gold rings and two of silver. The victims\r\nwere suffocated by the damp ashes that drifted in through the small\r\nwindows. According to the report of the excavations, fourteen\r\nskeletons of men were found in other parts of the house, together with\r\nthe skeletons of a dog and a goat.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEY TO PLAN IV\r\n\r\n     A.

In the last century similar buildings were brought to light in\r\nthe vicinity of Castellammare, but they were covered up again.\r\nEspecial importance attaches to this villa rustica, both on account of\r\nthe extreme rarity of examples of the type and because of the\r\ncharacter of the remains, which makes it possible to determine the\r\narrangements with certainty.\r\n\r\nThe living rooms, the stable, and the rooms used for the making of\r\nwine and oil were all under one roof. The size of the building is not\r\nso great as might have been assumed from the variety of purposes which\r\nit served; the enclosed area, exclusive of the threshing floor,\r\nmeasures about 130 by 82 feet. The plan (Plan IV) is regular, the\r\nprincipal entrance being near the middle of the southwest side.\r\n\r\nThe entrance was wide enough for carts and wagons, which were kept in\r\nthe court (_A_). Along three sides of the court ran a colonnade, over\r\nwhich at the front were upper rooms; the roof on the left side and the\r\nrear rested on columns connected by a parapet. Under the colonnade at\r\nthe further corner is a cistern curb (1), on one side of which is a\r\nlarge wash basin of masonry (2); on the other is a pillar supporting a\r\nsmall reservoir of lead (3). The reservoir, reached by means of steps\r\n(4), was filled from the cistern.\r\n\r\nIn a Roman farmhouse the kitchen was the large, central room (p. 253).\r\nVitruvius recommends that it be placed on the warmest side of the\r\ncourt; and in our villa rustica it lies at the north corner (_B_)\r\nwhere, in winter, it would receive the full benefit of the sunshine.\r\nThe hearth (1), on which remains of fire were found, stands in the\r\nmiddle of the room; in the wall at the rear is a niche, ornamented to\r\nresemble the facade of a diminutive temple, in which were placed the\r\nimages of the household gods.\r\n\r\nA large door in the right wall of the kitchen opened into the stable\r\n(_H_). Near it was a stairway (3) leading to upper rooms; in the\r\ncorner was a pit (4) affording access to a small cellar in which the\r\nstandard of the press beam in the adjoining room (_P_, 4) was made\r\nfast. In the opposite corner was a reservoir of lead (2) standing on a\r\nfoundation of masonry; it received water from the reservoir in the\r\ncourt (_A_, 3) and supplied the bath. On the same side of the room is\r\nthe entrance to the bath and to the closet (_G_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 185.--Hot water tank and reservoir for supplying\r\n   the bath in the villa rustica at Boscoreale.]\r\n\r\nThe arrangements of this bath are in a better state of preservation\r\nthan those of any other Roman bath yet discovered; the tank and\r\nreservoir with the connecting pipes may now be seen at Pompeii in the\r\nlittle Museum near the Forum fitted up for the exhibition of the\r\nobjects found in this villa. The bath rooms comprised an apodyterium\r\n(_D_), a tepidarium (_E_), and a caldarium (_F_) with a bath basin at\r\none end and a labrum in a semicircular recess at the other. The bath\r\nwas heated from a small furnace room (_C_). Over the hot air flue\r\nleading from the furnace into the hollow space under the floor of the\r\ncaldarium was a water heater in the form of a half cylinder similar to\r\nthe one found in the Stabian Baths (p. 194). The tepidarium, as well\r\nas the caldarium, had a hollow floor and walls.\r\n\r\nOver the furnace stood a round lead tank, the lower part of which was\r\nencased in masonry; the pipes connecting it with the reservoir in the\r\ncorner of the kitchen and with the bath rooms were found in place,\r\nand are shown in Fig. 185. The middle pipe supplied the tank with cold\r\nwater; the flow could be regulated by means of a stopcock. The lower\r\npipe started from the reservoir, but before reaching the tank was\r\ndivided, the left arm leading into the tank, the other into the bath\r\nbasin. As there were stopcocks in the main pipe and in the arm\r\nentering the tank, by adjusting these the bath basin could be supplied\r\nwith either hot or cold water through a single pipe. The upper pipe\r\nwas divided in the same way, one arm leading to the labrum. In the\r\npublic baths there was a separate tank for lukewarm water; here a\r\nmoderate temperature was obtained by mixing hot and cold water.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the tank (seen at the right) is a short bibcock used\r\nwhen the water was drawn off. On the side of the reservoir we see the\r\nend of the feed pipe leading from the reservoir in the court; at the\r\nright is a supply pipe which conducted to the stable (_H_) water not\r\nneeded for the bath.\r\n\r\nOn the same side of the court is a tool room (_J_), in which were\r\nfound remains of tools; several sickles were hanging on the walls.\r\nNext are two sleeping rooms (_K_, _L_); a passage between them leads\r\nto the bakery, with a single mill (1) and oven (2). In the corner is a\r\ndining room (_N_) in which the remains of three couches were found; it\r\nwas separated from the court by an anteroom (_M_).\r\n\r\nOver the colonnade on the front side of the court was a sleeping room\r\nwith a large room adjoining, perhaps the bedroom of the overseer,\r\n_villicus_, which, according to Varro should be near the entrance.\r\n\r\nThe oblong room at the northeast side of the court contained\r\nappliances for making wine. At each end was a large press with a\r\nraised floor (_forum_, 1). The presses were operated on the same\r\nprinciple as that previously described (p. 336, Fig. 168).\r\n\r\nAt the rear of each press was a strong standard (_arbor_, 4), to which\r\nthe inner end of the press beam (_prelum_) was attached. In front\r\nstood two posts (_stipites_, 5-5), to which were fitted the ends of a\r\nhorizontal windlass. By means of a pulley and a rope passed around the\r\nwindlass, the outer end of the press beam could be raised or lowered.\r\nWhen it was lowered in order to increase the pressure on the grapes,\r\nboth standard and windlass posts would be pulled out of the ground\r\nunless firmly braced. Under the rear of each press was a small cellar,\r\nin which was placed a framework for holding the standard in place. One\r\nwas entered from a pit in the corner of the kitchen (_B_, 4), the\r\nother from a similar depression in a small separate room (_W_); at 6\r\nwas a pit for fastening the windlass posts.\r\n\r\nThe grape juice ran into round vats (2, 2) sunk in the ground. In\r\nfront of the first press are two, in front of the second only one; a\r\ncistern of which the curb (3) is indicated on the plan, here takes the\r\nplace of the other vat. The cistern could be filled also from the\r\nfirst press by means of a lead pipe under the floor. The round vats\r\nwere for the pure juice of the first pressing. Into the other was\r\nconducted the product of the second pressing; the remains of the\r\ngrapes, after the juice had ceased to flow, were drenched with water\r\nand again subjected to pressure.\r\n\r\nIn Pliny's \"Natural History\" (XIV. xxi. 136) we read that in Campania\r\nthe best wine underwent fermentation in the open air, exposed to sun,\r\nrain, and wind. This villa supplies an interesting confirmation of the\r\nstatement; the round fermentation vats fill a large court (_R_), the\r\nwalls of which are pierced with openings in order to give readier\r\naccess to the wind. Along one side runs a channel of masonry about\r\nthree feet above the ground (1), protected by a narrow roof; thence\r\nthe grape juice was distributed through lead pipes to the vats. During\r\nthe vintage season, the inner end of the channel was connected with\r\nthe press room by means of a temporary pipe or channel entering the\r\nwall above the cistern (_P_, 3).\r\n\r\nThe surface of this court is higher than that of the rest of the\r\nbuilding; instead of excavating in order to set the large earthen vats\r\nin the ground, the proprietor filled in with earth around them. In one\r\ncorner is a lead kettle (3) with a place for building a fire\r\nunderneath; perhaps wine was heated in it. The vats in the court seem\r\nnot to have been used exclusively for wine. In one were found remains\r\nof wheat, in another of millet. Other vats stood in the passageway on\r\nthe side of the court (_Q_, 1).\r\n\r\nThree of the small rooms toward the rear were sleeping rooms (_V-V_).\r\nIn another (_X_) was found a hand mill. At the end of the passageway\r\nwas a double room containing the appliances for making oil, a press\r\n(in _Y_) and a crusher (in _Z_). The press was like the wine press\r\ndescribed above, only much smaller, with a raised floor (1), a\r\nstandard for the press beam (2), a pit for bracing the standard of the\r\npress beam (3), two posts at the ends of the windlass (4, 4), a pit\r\nfrom which a crosspiece connecting these posts could be reached, and a\r\nvat (6) at one side for receiving the oil. This vat, for some reason\r\nnot understood, was divided into two parts by a partition in the\r\nmiddle.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 186.--Olive crusher.]\r\n\r\nThe olive crusher, _trapetum_, now in the Museum at Pompeii mentioned\r\nabove, is shown in the accompanying illustration (Fig. 186). It was\r\ndesigned to separate the pulp of the olives from the stones, which\r\nwere thought to impair the flavor of the oil. It consists of a deep\r\ncircular basin of lava, so hollowed out as to leave in the centre a\r\nstrong standard of the stone, _miliarium_. In the top of this standard\r\nwas set an iron pin, on which was fitted a revolving wooden crosspiece\r\n(shown in Fig. 186, restored). This carried two wheels of lava, having\r\nthe shape of half a lens, which travelled in the basin. The wheels\r\nwere carefully balanced so that they would not press against the side\r\nof the basin and crush the stones of the olives.\r\n\r\nIn the long room _S_ remains of bean straw and parts of a wagon were\r\nfound. South of it is the threshing floor (_T_), the surface of which\r\nis raised above the ground and covered with Signia pavement. The water\r\nthat fell upon the threshing floor was conducted to a small open\r\ncistern (_U_).\r\n\r\nFor at least a part of the year the proprietor of the villa probably\r\nlived in it. So elaborate a bath would not have been built for the use\r\nof slaves; and in the second story was a modest but comfortable series\r\nof apartments (over _V_, _W_, _X_, and part of _Q_), apparently\r\ndesigned for the master's use, as was also the dining room (_N_) with\r\n_K_ and _L_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 187.--Silver patera with a representation of the\r\n   city of Alexandria in high relief. From the Boscoreale treasure.]\r\n\r\nIn a place where such a find would least have been anticipated--the\r\ncistern in the room of the wine presses--was made a remarkable\r\ndiscovery of treasure. Here a man had taken refuge, and with his\r\nskeleton were found about a thousand gold coins, four gold bracelets,\r\near-rings, a gold chain, and the beautiful collection of silver ware\r\n(p. 380) afterwards presented by Baron Rothschild to the Louvre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\n_HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE_\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch less large furniture has been found at Pompeii than is ordinarily\r\nsupposed. In not a single sleeping room has a bed been preserved; and\r\nin only one of all the dining rooms have sufficient remains of the\r\ndining couches been found to make it possible to reconstruct them.\r\nBeds, couches, chairs, and tables were ordinarily of wood, which\r\ncrumbled away, leaving slight traces. Reference has been made\r\nelsewhere to the marble tables standing in the atrium, and\r\noccasionally in other parts of the house. Tables of bronze are\r\ninfrequently met with, while bronze chairs are almost as rare as\r\nbronze couches.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 188.--Dining couch with bronze mountings, the\r\n   wooden frame being restored.]\r\n\r\nWood was not a suitable material for many classes of smaller articles,\r\nand these, made of bronze, clay, glass, or stone, are found in great\r\nnumbers. Such are the lamps, the bronze lamp stands, the kitchen\r\nutensils, the table furnishings, and the toilet articles of bronze,\r\nivory, or bone.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 189.--Round marble table.]\r\n\r\nThe wooden frame and end board of one of the dining couches just\r\nmentioned was completely charred, but the form was clearly indicated,\r\nand the woodwork has been restored (Fig. 188). The couch is now in the\r\nNaples Museum, as are also the other articles of furniture illustrated\r\nin this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe half figures on the front of the end board, shown more plainly in\r\nthe detail at the left of the illustration, were cast; the rest of the\r\nmounting was _repousse_ work. The bronze on the side toward the table\r\nwas inlaid with silver. The end boards were placed at the head of the\r\nupper couch and the foot of the lower one (p. 263); the middle couch\r\ndid not have a raised end. The mattress rested on straps stretched\r\nacross the frame. The dining room in which the couches were found\r\nadjoins the tablinum of a house in the seventh Region (VII. ii. 18).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 190.--Carved table leg, found in the second\r\n   peristyle of the house of the Faun.]\r\n\r\nThe carved marble supports of a gartibulum are shown in Fig. 121; a\r\ncomplete table of a plainer type is seen in Plate VII. An example of a\r\nround marble table, found in 1827 in a house near the Forum, is\r\npresented in Fig. 189. The three legs are carved to represent those of\r\nlions, a lion's head being placed at the top of each. A table of\r\nsimilar design was found in the peristyle of the house of the Vettii,\r\nwith traces of yellow color on the manes of the lions (p. 326).\r\n\r\nAmong the best examples of ornamental carving is the marble table leg\r\nin the form of a sphinx, found in the second peristyle of the house of\r\nthe Faun (Fig. 190). Effective also is the bold carving of the\r\ngartibulum in the north atrium of the house of Siricus (VII. i. 25).\r\n\r\nSmall tables or stands of bronze supported by three slender legs were\r\ncalled tripods. The top was flat, but not infrequently surrounded by a\r\ndeep rim, making a convenient receptacle for light objects. The rim of\r\nthe example shown in Fig. 191 is ornamented with festoons and\r\nbucrania, while the upper parts of the legs are modelled to represent\r\nwinged sphinxes. This stand was not found in the temple of Isis, as is\r\noften stated, but probably in Herculaneum.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 191.--Bronze stand with an ornamented rim around\r\n   the top.]\r\n\r\nThe bisellium, the 'seat of double width,' was a chair of simple\r\ndesign without a back, used in the Theatre and Amphitheatre by members\r\nof the city council and others upon whom the \"honor of the bisellium\"\r\nhad been conferred. The remains of one with bronze mountings have been\r\nrestored. The restoration, however, does not seem to be correct in all\r\nparticulars, and instead of presenting it we may refer the reader to\r\nthe somewhat conventional bisellium carved on the tomb of Calventius\r\nQuietus (Fig. 242).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 192.--Lamps of the simplest form, with one\r\n   nozzle.]\r\n\r\nThe lamps are found in a great variety of forms. The essential parts\r\nare the body, containing the oil, which was poured in through an\r\nopening in the top, and the nozzle with a hole for the wick (Fig.\r\n192). Hand lamps were usually provided with a handle, hanging lamps\r\nwith projections containing holes through which the chains could be\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nThe opening for the admission of oil was often closed by an ornamental\r\ncover (Figs. 195, 196). In front of it, near the base of the nozzle,\r\nwas frequently a much smaller orifice through which a large needle\r\ncould be inserted to pick up the wick when it had burned out and sunk\r\nback into the oil, and air could be admitted when the cover was\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 193.--Lamps with two nozzles. At the left, a\r\n   hanging lamp; at the right, a hand lamp.]\r\n\r\nThe material of the lamps was clay or bronze. The bronze lamps were\r\nmore costly and ordinarily more freely ornamented. Those of clay were\r\nleft unglazed, or covered with a red glazing like that of the Arretian\r\nware; lamps with a greenish glaze are occasionally found.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 194.--Lamps with more than two nozzles.]\r\n\r\nThe light furnished by the wicks was dim and smoky. A more brilliant\r\nlight was obtained by increasing the number of nozzles. Lamps with\r\ntwo nozzles are often found. These were sometimes placed at one end,\r\nthe handle being at the other; sometimes in the case of hanging lamps,\r\nat opposite ends, as in the example shown in Fig. 193.\r\n\r\nLamps with several nozzles are not infrequently met with. The shape is\r\noften circular, as in two of the examples presented in Fig. 194, one\r\nof which had six wicks, the other twelve. Sometimes a more ornamental\r\nform was adopted. Lamps having the shape of a boat are not uncommon;\r\nthe one represented in Fig. 194 was provided with nozzles for fourteen\r\nwicks.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 195.--Bronze lamps with ornamental covers attached\r\n   to a chain.]\r\n\r\nThe hanging lamps were sometimes made with a single nozzle, as the\r\ncurious one having the shape of a mask shown in Fig. 197, at the left;\r\nsometimes with two nozzles (Fig. 193). Bronze hanging lamps with three\r\narms, each of which contained a place for a wick, are occasionally\r\nfound; an example is given in Fig. 197, at the right. Still more\r\nelaborate are those with a large number of nozzles, as the one\r\nrepresented in the same illustration, which had nine wicks.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 196.--Bronze lamps with covers ornamented with\r\n   figures.]\r\n\r\nThe name of the maker is often stamped upon the bottom of the lamp,\r\nsometimes in the nominative case, as PULCHER, in the example given in\r\nFig. 192, more often in the genitive and in an abbreviated form.\r\n\r\nThe variety displayed in the ornamentation of lamps was as great as\r\nthat manifested in the forms. Ornament was applied to all parts,--the\r\nbody, the handle, the cover, and even the nozzle. The covers of the\r\ntwo bronze lamps shown in Fig. 196 are adorned with figures. On one is\r\na Cupid struggling with a goose. The chain attached to the right hand\r\nof the figure on the other is fastened to a hooked needle for pulling\r\nout the wick.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 197.--Three hanging lamps. The one at the left and\r\n   the middle one are presented in two views.]\r\n\r\nThe object of which we give a representation in Fig. 198, often\r\nerroneously classed as a lamp, is a nursing bottle, _biberon_. The\r\nmaterial is clay, and the figure of a gladiator is stamped on it,\r\nsymbolizing the hope that the infant will develop strength and vigor.\r\nOn some bottles of this kind the figure of a thriving child is seen,\r\non others a mother suckling a child.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 198.--A nursing bottle.]\r\n\r\nThree kinds of supports for lamps may be distinguished according to\r\ntheir size: lamp standards, which stood on the floor and ranged in\r\nheight from 21/2 to 5 feet; lamp holders, not far from 20 inches high,\r\nwhich were placed on tables; and small lamp stands, also used on the\r\ntable. The general term _candelabrum_ was originally applied to candle\r\nholders containing several candles (_candelae_). Such candle holders\r\nhave been found in Etruscan graves, but the candelabra met with at\r\nPompeii were all designed to carry lamps.\r\n\r\nThe lamp standards, of bronze, are often of graceful proportions and\r\nornamented in good taste. The feet are modelled to represent the claws\r\n(Fig. 199) or hoofs of animals. The slender shaft rises sometimes\r\ndirectly from the union of the three legs at the centre, sometimes\r\nfrom a round, ornamented disk resting on the legs. Above the shaft is\r\nusually an ornamental form, a sphinx, as in our illustration, a head,\r\nor a vase-like capital sustaining the round flat top on which the lamp\r\nrested. Occasionally the shaft is replaced by a conventional plant\r\nform.\r\n\r\nAdjustable standards also occur; the upper part slides up and down in\r\nthe hollow shaft of the lower part, so that the height can be changed\r\nat will.\r\n\r\nThe bronze lamp holders were sometimes designed to support a single\r\nlamp (Fig. 200). Frequently the main part divides into two branches,\r\neach of which sustains a small round disk for a lamp; often the arms\r\nor branches were designed to carry hanging lamps. The example shown in\r\nFig. 201 is from the villa of Diomedes.\r\n\r\nIn the lamp holders conventional plant forms are more frequently met\r\nwith than in the standards. The trunk of a tree with spreading\r\nbranches is especially common (Fig. 202).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 199.--Lamp standard, of bronze.]\r\n\r\nThe lamp stands, which resemble diminutive bronze tables, are found in\r\na pleasing variety of form and ornament. The top is sometimes a round\r\ndisk resting on a single leg supported by three feet; sometimes, as in\r\nthe example presented in Fig. 203, the legs are carried to the top,\r\nand the intervening spaces are utilized for ornamentation. The lamp\r\nseen in this illustration is the same as that shown more clearly in\r\nFig. 196, at the right.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 200.--Lamp holder for a hand lamp.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 201.--Lamp holder for hanging lamps.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 202.--Lamp holder in the form of a tree trunk.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 203.--Lamp stand, of bronze.]\r\n\r\nKitchen utensils of bronze and red earthenware have been found in\r\ngreat quantity; table furnishings more rarely. A group of typical\r\nexamples is presented in Fig. 204. The forms are so similar to those\r\nof the utensils found in modern households that few words of\r\nexplanation are needed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 204.--Bronze utensils.\r\n\r\n     _a._ Kettle mounted on a tripod ready to be placed on the fire.\r\n     _b_, _g_, _h_, _l._ Cooking pots.\r\n     _c_, _d._ Pails.\r\n     _e._ Ladle.\r\n     _f._ Dipper.\r\n     _i_, _t._ Baking pans for small cakes.\r\n     _k._ Pitcher.\r\n     _m._ Kitchen spoon.\r\n     _n_, _v._ Table spoons.\r\n     _o_, _p._ Frying pans.\r\n     _s._ Pastry mould.\r\n     _q_, _u._ Wine ladles.\r\n     _r._ Two-handled pan.]\r\n\r\nThe pastry mould (_s_) is of good size and neatly finished, and must\r\nhave left a clear impression. Besides the two types of table spoons\r\nillustrated here (_n_, _v_) a third is represented by examples found at\r\nPompeii, the _cochlear_, which had a bowl at one end and ran out into\r\na point at the other. The point was used in picking shellfish out of\r\ntheir shells, the bowl in eating eggs.\r\n\r\nThe two long ladles were used in dipping wine out of the mixing bowl\r\ninto the cups. The ancients ordinarily drank their wine mingled with\r\nwater; for mixing the liquids they used a large bowl of earthenware or\r\nmetal, which was often richly ornamented. The mixing bowl presented in\r\nFig. 205 was found in a house on Abbondanza Street, near the entrance\r\nof the building of Eumachia. It is in part inlaid with silver, and\r\nnearly twenty-two inches high.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 205.--Mixing bowl, of bronze in part inlaid with\r\n   silver.]\r\n\r\nHot water was often preferred for mixing with wine, and small heaters\r\nof ornamental design were sometimes used upon the table. The ancient\r\nname for these utensils is _authepsa_, 'self-cooker'; the\r\nappropriateness of it is apparent from an example found at Pompeii, in\r\nwhich the coals of fire were entirely concealed from view.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 206.--Water heater for the table, view and\r\n   section.]\r\n\r\nThis heater (Fig. 206) has the form of an urn. In the middle is a\r\ntube, the bottom of which is closed by a diminutive grate; the\r\narrangement is shown in the section at the right. In this tube the\r\ncoals were placed, and when the water in the urn was hot, it could be\r\ndrawn off by means of a faucet at the side. Back of the faucet is a\r\nsmall vertical vent tube.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 207.--Water heater in the form of a brazier.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 208.--Water heater in the form of a brazier\r\n   representing a diminutive fortress.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 210.--Combs.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 209.--Appliances for the bath.]\r\n\r\nIn some cases the appearance of a heater was more suggestive of its\r\npurpose. One (Fig. 207) has the form of an ordinary brazier, the water\r\nbeing heated in the hollow space about the fire pan. In another\r\ninstance (Fig. 208) the brazier is ornamented with towers and\r\nbattlements like those of a diminutive fortress; the faucet can be\r\nseen in our illustration, on the left side.\r\n\r\nAn interesting group of toilet appliances for the bath was found in\r\nthe Baths north of the Forum (Fig. 209). Hanging from a ring were an\r\nunguent flask, four scrapers (_strigiles_), and a shallow saucer with\r\na handle in which the unguent was poured out when it was to be\r\napplied. One of the scrapers is repeated in a side view at the right,\r\nand both side and front views of the unguent saucer are given.\r\n\r\nSmall articles of toilet are discovered in a good state of\r\npreservation. The forms in most cases do not differ greatly from those\r\nto which we are accustomed.\r\n\r\nThe fine comb seen in Fig. 210 _a_ is of bone; the two coarse combs\r\n(Fig. 210 _b_ and Fig. 214 _d_) are of bronze.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 211.--Hairpins. Underneath, two small ivory toilet\r\n   boxes.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 212.--Glass box for cosmetics.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 213.--Hand mirrors.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 214.--Group of toilet articles.\r\n\r\n     _a._ Standing mirror.\r\n     _b._ Ear cleaner.\r\n     _c._ Ivory box for cosmetics.\r\n     _d._ Bronze comb.]\r\n\r\nThe ends of the hairpins were often ornamented with figures. The\r\nspecimens shown in Fig. 211 are of ivory. The designs in which female\r\nfigures appear are in keeping with the use, but the ornamentation for\r\nthe most part seems excessive.\r\n\r\nThe toilet boxes, of glass or ivory, were used for a variety of\r\npurposes. Of those presented in our illustrations, one (Fig. 211, at\r\nthe right) probably contained perfumed oil. The round glass box (Fig.\r\n212) was used for cosmetics, as was also the ivory box seen in Fig.\r\n214, the outside of which is carved in low relief.\r\n\r\nThe mirrors were of metal, highly polished. The one seen in Fig. 214\r\nwas designed to stand upon a dressing case; the other three (Fig. 213)\r\nare hand mirrors. The frame of the rectangular mirror is modern;\r\nwhether or not this had a handle is not clear.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 215.--Gold arm band.]\r\n\r\nJewellery of gold and silver and other small objects wrought in the\r\nprecious metals have now and then been found. A characteristic example\r\nof the jewellery is the large gold arm band in the form of a serpent,\r\nwith eyes of rubies, found in the house of the Faun (Fig. 215). It\r\nweighs twenty-two ounces; to judge from the size, it must have been\r\nintended for the upper arm.\r\n\r\nMuch more important, from the aesthetic point of view, are the cups\r\nand other articles of silver designed for table use. As these do not\r\ndiffer essentially from objects of the same class found elsewhere, we\r\nshould not be warranted in entering upon an extended discussion of\r\nthem here; a few examples must suffice.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 216.--Silver cups.]\r\n\r\nOf the three cups with _repousse_ reliefs shown in Fig. 216, one\r\n(_a_) has a simple but effective decoration of leaves. Another (_c_)\r\npresents the apotheosis of Homer; the bard is being carried to heaven\r\nby an eagle, while on either side (detail in _b_) sits an allegorical\r\nfigure--the Iliad with helmet, shield, and spear, and the Odyssey with\r\na sailor's cap and a steering paddle. On the third (_d_, detail in\r\nFig. 216 _e_) we see a male and a female Centaur, with Bacchic\r\nemblems, conversing with Cupids posed gracefully on their backs. This\r\nlast is one of a pair found in 1835.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 216.--Detail of cup with Centaurs.]\r\n\r\nThe Boscoreale treasure contained a hundred and three specimens of\r\nsilver ware, undoubtedly the collection of an amateur.\r\n\r\nOf the purely decorative pieces the finest is the shallow bowl\r\n(_phiala_, _patera_) 8-7/8 inches in diameter, with an allegorical\r\nrepresentation of the city of Alexandria, in high relief (Fig. 187).\r\nThe city is personified as a female divinity--alert, powerful,\r\nmajestic. Upon her head are the spoils of an elephant; the trunk and\r\ntusks project above, while the huge ears, hanging down behind, are\r\nskilfully adjusted to the outline of the goddess's neck.\r\n\r\nIn the fold of her chiton, held by the right hand, and in the\r\ncornucopia resting on the left arm, are fruits of Egypt, among which\r\ngrapes and pomegranates are easily distinguished. A representation of\r\nHelios appears in low relief upon the upper part of the cornucopia;\r\nbelow is the eagle, emblem of the Ptolemies. A lion is mounted on the\r\nright shoulder of the goddess; in her right hand she holds an asp,\r\nsacred to Isis, with head uplifted as in the representation described\r\nby Apuleius (Met. XI. 4); facing the asp is a female panther.\r\n\r\nAround the group in low relief are the attributes (not all\r\ndistinguishable in our illustration) of various divinities--the bow\r\nand quiver of Artemis, the club of Hercules, the sistrum of Isis, the\r\nforceps of Vulcan, the serpent of Aesculapius entwined around a staff,\r\nthe sword of Mars in a scabbard, and the lyre of Apollo. A dolphin in\r\nthe midst of waves (under the right hand) symbolizes the maritime\r\nrelations of the city.\r\n\r\nThe central medallion (_emblema_) was made separately and attached to\r\nthe bottom of the patera. Between it and the outer edge of the bowl is\r\na band of pleasing ornament, composed of sprays of myrtle and laurel.\r\nThe surface of the medallion was all gilded except the undraped\r\nportions of the goddess. The ears of the goddess were pierced for\r\near-rings, which were not found. The date of the patera can not be\r\ndetermined; it is perhaps as old as the reign of Augustus.\r\n\r\nAmong the cups, sixteen in number, two are especially noteworthy. They\r\nare four inches high, and form a pair; they are ornamented with\r\nskeletons in high relief, so grouped that each cup presents four\r\nscenes satirizing human life and its interpretation in poetry and\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nTwo scenes from one of the cups are shown in Fig. 217. At the left the\r\nStoic Zeno appears, standing stiffly with his philosopher's staff in his\r\nleft hand, his wallet hanging from his neck; with right hand extended he\r\npoints the index finger in indignation and scorn at Epicurus, who,\r\npaying no heed to him, is taking a piece of a huge cake lying on the top\r\nof a small round table. Beside Epicurus an eager pig with snout and left\r\nforeleg uplifted is demanding a share. Over the cake is the inscription:\r\n[Greek: to telos hedone], 'the end of life is pleasure.' The letters of\r\nthe inscription, as of the names of the philosophers, are too small to\r\nbe shown distinctly in our illustration.\r\n\r\nNo names are given with the figures in the other scene; a kind of genre\r\npicture is presented. The skeleton in the middle is placing a wreath of\r\nflowers upon his head. The one at the right holds in one hand a skull\r\nwhich he examines contemplatively--we are reminded of Hamlet in the\r\nscene with the gravedigger; in the other hand (not seen in the\r\nillustration) is a wreath of flowers. The third of the principal figures\r\nholds in his right hand a bag exceedingly heavy, as indicated by the\r\nadjustment of the bones of the right arm and leg; over the bag is the\r\nword [Greek: phthonoi], 'envyings.' The object in the left hand is so\r\nlight that its weight is not felt; it is a butterfly, held by the wings,\r\nand above it is inscribed [Greek: psychion], a diminutive of [Greek:\r\npsyche], 'soul'; we shall later find another instance of the\r\nrepresentation of a disembodied soul as a butterfly (p. 398). It was\r\nperhaps the design of the artist to represent the figure as holding the\r\nbag behind him while presenting the butterfly to the one who is putting\r\non the wreath.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 217.--Silver cup with skeleton groups.\r\n   From the Boscoreale treasure.]\r\n\r\nOn either side of the middle figure are two others less than half as\r\nlarge. One, under the butterfly, is playing the lyre; over his head is\r\nthe word [Greek: terpsis], 'pleasure.' The second is clapping his hands,\r\nand above him is a Greek inscription which gives the thought of the\r\nwhole design: 'So long as you live take your full share' of life, 'for\r\nthe morrow is uncertain.'\r\n\r\nBoth cups had evidently long been in use; there are still some traces\r\nof gilding, which, however, seems not to have been applied to the\r\nskeletons. While the explanatory inscriptions are in Greek, a Latin\r\nname, Gavia, is inscribed on the under side of the second cup, in the\r\nsame kind of letters as the record of weight (p. 508). The Gavii were\r\na family of some prominence at Pompeii; we are perhaps warranted in\r\nconcluding that the cups were made by a Greek for this Pompeian lady,\r\nand that afterward they came into the possession of another lady,\r\nMaxima, who formed the collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nTRADES AND OCCUPATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\n_THE TRADES AT POMPEII.--THE BAKERS_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn antiquity there was no such distinction between trades and\r\nprofessions as exists to-day. In the Early Empire all activity outside\r\nthe field of public service, civil and military, or the management of\r\nestates, was considered beneath the dignity of a Roman; the practice\r\nof law, which had received its impulse largely from the obligation of\r\npatrons to protect their clients, was included among public duties.\r\nThe ordinary work of life was left mainly to slaves and freedmen. Not\r\nonly the trades, as we understand the term, but architecture and\r\nengineering,--in antiquity two branches of one occupation,--the\r\npractice of medicine, and teaching, were looked upon as menial. A\r\nRoman of literary or practical bent might manifest an interest in such\r\nvocations, but it was considered hardly respectable actively to engage\r\nin them.\r\n\r\nThis attitude of mind, especially toward the higher occupations, is\r\nonly explicable in the light of the social conditions then existing.\r\nMen who kept slaves of every degree of intelligence and training, and\r\nwere at all times accustomed to command, were not disposed to hold\r\nthemselves in readiness to do another's bidding, excepting in the\r\nservice of the State alone; and work committed to slaves and freedmen\r\nnaturally came to be considered unworthy the employment of a\r\ngentleman. The freemen of the same craft were often united in guilds\r\nor corporations, for the administration of certain matters of mutual\r\ninterest; but nothing is known in regard to the activities of such\r\norganizations at Pompeii.\r\n\r\nIn a city as large as Pompeii, all the occupations corresponding to\r\nthe needs of daily life must have been represented. The remains of the\r\nappliances and products of labor are of the most varied character,\r\nsometimes far from satisfactory, raising more difficulties than they\r\nsolve; yet often revealing at a glance the ancient methods of work,\r\nand casting light upon the economic background of Greek and Roman\r\nculture. The excavations have brought before us three sources of\r\ninformation, inscriptions, paintings, and the remains of buildings or\r\nrooms used as workshops.\r\n\r\nThe inscriptions refer to more than a score of occupations; from\r\nfarming to innkeeping, and from hairdressing to goldworking. Most of\r\nthem are election notices, in which the members of a craft unite, or\r\nare exhorted to unite, in recommending a certain candidate for a\r\nmunicipal office. These are painted in red letters on the walls along\r\nthe streets, and are much alike, though some are fuller than others.\r\nThe simplest form contains only three words, as _Trebium aed.\r\ntonsores_,--'The barbers recommend Trebius for the office of aedile.'\r\nThe more elaborate recommendations may be illustrated by the\r\nfollowing: _Verum aed. o. v. f._ (for _aedilem, oro vos, facite_),\r\n_unguentari, facite, rog[o]_,--'Do make Verus aedile, perfumers, elect\r\nhim, I beg of you.' The whole craft of goldsmiths favored the election\r\nof Pansa: _C. Cuspium Pansam aed. aurifices universi rog[ant]_,--'All\r\nthe goldsmiths recommend Gaius Cuspius Pansa for the aedileship.'\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of the fruit sellers are particularly conspicuous.\r\nOn one occasion they joined with a prominent individual in the support\r\nof a ticket: _M. Holconium Priscum II vir. i. d. pomari universi cum\r\nHelvio Vestale rog._,--'All the fruit sellers, together with Helvius\r\nVestalis, urge the election of M. Holconius Priscus as duumvir with\r\njudiciary authority.' There may have been some special reason why the\r\nfruiterers wished to keep in favor with the city authorities, and so\r\ntook an active part in the elections; the dealers in garlic (_aliari_)\r\nalso had a candidate.\r\n\r\nAmong the representatives of other employments that joined in the\r\nsupport of candidates were the dyers (_offectores_), cloak-cutters\r\n(_sagarii_), pack-carriers (_saccarii_), mule-drivers (_muliones_),\r\nand fishermen (_piscicapi_). The inscription in which reference is\r\nmade to the gig-drivers is mentioned elsewhere (p. 243).\r\n\r\nThe paintings in which we see work going on are numerous. By far the\r\nmost pleasing are those in which the workmen are Cupids, busying\r\nthemselves with the affairs of men. Several pictures of this kind have\r\nalready been described (pp. 97, 332-337); but we ought to add to those\r\nmentioned two scenes from Herculaneum, often reproduced, in which\r\nCupids are represented as carpenters and as shoemakers.\r\n\r\nAmong the more important paintings in which the figures of men appear\r\nare those which picture the life of an inn and those that present the\r\nprocesses of cleaning cloth; both groups are reserved for later\r\ndiscussion. In a house in the ninth Region (IX. v. 9) a stuccoer is\r\npictured at work putting the finishing touches on a wall with a\r\nsmoothing tool, and in the house of the Surgeon an artist is seen\r\npainting a herm (Fig. 133).\r\n\r\nIn only a few instances are the remains of workshops sufficiently\r\ncharacteristic to indicate their purpose. Among the most impressive,\r\nto the visitor at Pompeii, are the ruins of the bakeries, with their\r\nlarge millstones (Fig. 218). Equally important, also, are the remains\r\nof the fulleries, and of a large tannery, which, as well as those of\r\nthe inns and winerooms, will be discussed in separate chapters.\r\n\r\nA few out of the hundreds of shops opening on the streets contain\r\nremains of the articles exposed for sale. The discovery of charred\r\nnuts, fruits, and loaves of bread in the market stalls north of the\r\nMacellum has already been noted (p. 96). We know the use of other\r\nshops from the remains of paints found in them. The arrangements of\r\nsuch places of business were discussed in connection with those of the\r\nPompeian house.\r\n\r\nSeveral establishments which contain large lead kettles set in\r\nmasonry, with a place for a fire underneath, have been identified as\r\ndyehouses. In the case of one on Stabian Street (VII. ii. 11), the\r\nidentification seems complete. Nine such kettles stood in the\r\nperistyle, which has a direct connection with the street; in a closet\r\nwere numerous bottles, part of which contained coloring materials.\r\nThere was formerly a painting on the wall of the entrance,\r\nrepresenting a man carrying on a pole an object which had the\r\nappearance of a garment fresh from the dye.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 218.--Ruins of a bakery, with millstones.]\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the street is the election notice: _Postumium\r\nProculum aed. offectores rog[ant]_,--'The dyers request the election\r\nof Postumius Proculus as aedile.' The house on which this inscription\r\nis painted (IX. iii. 2) contained three kettles similar to those\r\nalready mentioned; the dyers of both establishments may have united in\r\nsupporting the candidacy of Proculus.\r\n\r\nA potter's workshop, with two ovens, is located outside the\r\nHerculaneum Gate, where the streets divide opposite the villa of\r\nDiomedes (Plan V, 29-30). The ovens, which are not large, have an\r\nupper division, in which were placed the vessels to be baked, and a\r\nfirebox underneath, the floor above being pierced with holes to let\r\nthe heat through. The vault of one of the ovens was constructed of\r\nparallel rows of jars fitted into one another.\r\n\r\nThere was a shoemaker's shop on the northwest corner of Insula VII. i\r\nopening upon two streets. It is connected with the entrance hall of\r\nthe adjoining house (No. 40), and near the middle is a small stone\r\ntable. The identification rests upon the discovery here of certain\r\ntools, particularly leather-cutters' knives with a crescent-shaped\r\nblade; there was also an inscription on the wall, making record of\r\nsome repairing done 'July 14, with a sharp-cornered knife (_scalpro\r\nangulato_) and an awl.' Apparently the porter of the house\r\n(_ostiarius_) was at the same time a cobbler, as frequently in Italy\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nOn the same wall is another scribbling: _M. Nonius Campanus mil. coh.\r\nVIIII pr. > Caesi_,--'Marcus Nonius Campanus, a soldier of the ninth\r\npraetorian cohort, of the century led by Caesius.' The name of the\r\ncenturion, M. Caesius Blandus, is scratched twice on the columns of\r\nthe peristyle in the same house. Captain and private may have come\r\nfrom Rome in the escort of an emperor. Perhaps the centurion was\r\nquartered in this house; the soldier, waiting to have his shoes\r\nmended, scratched his name upon the wall.\r\n\r\nThe better houses were so freely adorned with statuettes and other\r\nornaments of marble that there must have been marble-workers in the\r\ncity. The workshop of one was found, in 1798, on Stabian Street, near\r\nthe Large Theatre. It contained various pieces of carving, as herms,\r\ntable feet, and table tops; there was also an unfinished mortar,\r\ntogether with a slab of marble partly sawed, the saw being left in the\r\ncut.\r\n\r\nSigns of shops are not often seen in Pompeii, but two or three may be\r\nmentioned. In the wall of a shop-front in the block containing the\r\nBaths north of the Forum, there is a terra cotta plaque with a goat in\r\nrelief, to indicate the place of a milk dealer; and not far away we\r\nfind a sign of a wineshop, a tufa relief of two men carrying between\r\nthem an amphora hung from a pole supported on their shoulders.\r\n\r\nNot all such reliefs, however, are signs of shops. Near the Porta\r\nMarina (at the northwest corner of Insula VII. xv), a tufa block may\r\nbe seen near the top of the wall, showing a mason's tools in relief;\r\nabove it is the inscription, _Diogenes structor_, 'Diogenes the\r\nmason.' This is not a sign--the inscription can hardly be read from\r\nbelow; it is, moreover, on the outside of a garden wall, with no\r\nhouse or shop entrance near it. It is rather a workman's signature;\r\nDiogenes had built the wall, and wished to leave a record of his\r\nskill.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn antiquity the miller and the baker were one person. We rarely find\r\nin Pompeii--and then only in private houses--an oven without mills\r\nunder the same roof. There were many bakeries in the city. The portion\r\nalready excavated contains more than twenty, each of them with three\r\nor four mills; bread was furnished, therefore, by a number of small\r\nbakeries rather than by a few large establishments.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 219.--Plan of a bakery.\r\n\r\n     8. Atrium.\r\n     15. Mill room.\r\n     16. Stable.\r\n     17. Oven.\r\n     18. Kneading room.\r\n     19. Storeroom.]\r\n\r\nThe appearance of a bakery to-day, with its mills and its large oven,\r\nmay be seen in Fig. 218. The arrangements can more easily be\r\nexplained, however, from the plan of another establishment, one of the\r\nlargest, in the third Insula of Region VI. (Fig. 219). Entering from\r\nthe street through the fauces, we find ourselves in an atrium of\r\nsimple form (8) with rooms on either side; the tablinum (14) is here\r\nmerely an entrance to the mill room (15). In the corner of the atrium\r\nis a stairway leading to a second story, which was particularly needed\r\nhere, because the living rooms at the rear were required for the\r\nbakery; the floor of the second story was supported by brick pillars\r\nat the corners of the impluvium, joined by flat arches.\r\n\r\nThe four mills (_b_), were turned by animals; the floor around them is\r\npaved with basalt flags like those used for the streets. In the same\r\nroom, at _d_, were the remains of a low table; at _c_ there is a\r\ncistern curb, with a large earthen vessel for holding water on either\r\nside, while the wall above was ornamented with a painting representing\r\nVesta, the patron goddess of bakers, between the two Lares. On one\r\nside of the oven (17) is the kneading room (18), on the other the\r\nstoreroom (19). The room at the left (16) is the stall for the donkeys\r\nthat turned the mills.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 220.--A Pompeian mill, without its framework.]\r\n\r\nThe mills of Pompeii, with slight variations, are all of one type; if\r\nthere were watermills on the Sarno, no trace of them has been found.\r\nThe millstones are of lava (p. 15). The lower stone, _meta_, has the\r\nshape of a cone resting on the end of a cylinder, but the cylindrical\r\npart is in most cases partially concealed by a thick hoop of masonry,\r\nthe top of which was formed into a trough to receive the flour, and\r\nwas covered with sheet lead (Fig. 220). A square hole, five or six\r\ninches across, was cut in the top of the cone, in which was inserted a\r\nwooden standard; this supported a vertical iron pivot on which the\r\nframe of the upper millstone turned.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 221.--Section of a mill, restored.]\r\n\r\nThe shape of the upper millstone, _catillus_, may best be seen in Fig.\r\n221. It was like a double funnel, the lower cavity being fitted to the\r\ncone of the lower millstone, while that in the upper part answered the\r\npurpose of a hopper. The two cavities were connected at the centre by\r\nan opening similar to that of an hourglass, which left room for the\r\nstandard and allowed the grain to run down slowly, when the _catillus_\r\nwas turned, to be ground between the two stones. The flour ran out at\r\nthe base of the cone and fell into the trough, ready to be sifted and\r\nmade into bread.\r\n\r\nThe upper millstone was nicely balanced over the lower, the surface of\r\nwhich it touched but lightly; it could not have rested on the under\r\nstone with full weight, for in that case the strength of a draft\r\nanimal would not have sufficed to move it. The stones could be set for\r\nfiner or coarser grinding by changing the length of the standard.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement for turning the mill was simple. In shaping the upper\r\nmillstone, strong shoulders were left in the narrowest part (Fig.\r\n220), on opposite sides. In these square sockets were cut, in which\r\nthe ends of shafts were inserted and firmly fastened by round bolts\r\npassing through the shoulders (Fig. 221). The shafts were tied to the\r\nends of the crossbeam above by curved vertical pieces of wood, or by\r\nstraps of iron, which were let into grooves in the stone and so made\r\nfirm. The crosspiece above, which turned on the pivot in the end of\r\nthe standard, was sometimes of iron, sometimes of wood with an iron\r\nsocket fitting the pivot. The framework must necessarily have been\r\nexceedingly strong. One of the mills at Pompeii (IX. iii. 10) has\r\nlately been set up with new woodwork, and grinds very well.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 222.--A mill in operation.  Relief in the Vatican\r\n   Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe smaller mills were turned by slaves, the larger by draft animals.\r\nMen pushed on the projecting shafts, but animals wore a collar which\r\nwas attached by a chain or rope to the end of the crosspiece at the\r\ntop. The links of the chain running to the crossbeam are distinctly\r\nshown in a relief in the Vatican Museum (Fig. 222), in which a horse\r\nis represented turning a mill. Blinders are over the eyes of the\r\nhorse, which seems also to be checked up in order to prevent eating. A\r\nsquare hopper rests on the crossbeam, and the miller is bringing a\r\nmeasure of wheat to pour into it. On a shelf in the corner of the room\r\nis a lamp.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 223.--Section of bake oven.]\r\n\r\nThe ovens were not unlike those still in use in many parts of Europe.\r\nThey were shaped like a low beehive, generally with some kind of a\r\nflue in front to make the fire burn inside while they were being\r\nheated. The oven in the bakery described above, however, has a special\r\ndevice for saving as much heat as possible (Fig. 223); it is entirely\r\nenclosed in a smoke chamber (_b_), with two openings above (_d_) for\r\nthe draft. Fires were kindled in such ovens with wood or charcoal; the\r\nlatter was probably used here. When the proper temperature for baking\r\nhad been reached, the ashes were raked out (in Fig. 223, _e_ is an\r\nashpit), the loaves of bread shoved in, and the mouth closed to retain\r\nthe heat. A receptacle for water stands in front of our oven (_f_), a\r\nconvenience for moistening the surface of the loaves while baking. The\r\nfront of the oven (at _c_) was connected with the rooms on either\r\nside, as may be more clearly seen by referring to Fig. 219. In the\r\nkneading room (18), where were found remains of a large table and\r\nshelves, the loaves were made ready, and could be passed through one\r\nopening to the front of the oven; the hot loaves could be conveniently\r\npassed through the other opening into the storeroom (19).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 224.--Kneading machine, plan and section.]\r\n\r\nIn many establishments a machine was used for kneading; the best\r\nexample is in a bakery on the north side of Insula xiv in Region VI.\r\nSuch kneading machines are seen also in ancient representations of the\r\nbaker's trade, as in the reliefs of the tomb of Eurysaces, near the\r\nPorta Maggiore at Rome.\r\n\r\nThe dough was placed in a round pan of lava a foot and a half or two\r\nfeet in diameter. In this a vertical shaft revolved, to the lower part\r\nof which two or three wooden arms were attached (three in Fig. 224);\r\nthe one at the bottom was strengthened by an iron crosspiece on the\r\nunder side, the projecting centre of which turned in a socket below.\r\nThe side of the pan was pierced in two or three places for the\r\ninsertion of wooden teeth, so placed as not to interfere with the\r\nrevolution of the arms. As the shaft was turned, the dough was pushed\r\nforward by the arms and held back by the teeth, being thus thoroughly\r\nkneaded. Modern kneading machines are constructed on the same\r\nprinciple, but have two sets of teeth on horizontal cylinders\r\nrevolving toward each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\n_THE FULLERS AND THE TANNERS_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe work of the ancient fuller was twofold, to make ready for use the\r\ncloth fresh from the loom, and to cleanse garments that had been worn.\r\nAs the garments used by the Romans were mainly of wool, and needed\r\nskilful manipulation to retain their size and shape, they were\r\nordinarily sent out of the house to be cleansed; in consequence the\r\ntrade of the fuller was relatively important. In the part of Pompeii\r\nthus far excavated we find two large fulleries and one smaller\r\nestablishment that can be identified with certainty; and there were\r\ndoubtless many laundries, with less ample facilities, the purpose of\r\nwhich is not clearly indicated by the remains. The following account\r\nof the processes employed relates exclusively to woollen fabrics.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the destruction of Pompeii, soap, a Gallic invention,\r\nwas only beginning to come into use; the commonest substitute was\r\nfuller's earth, _creta fullonia_, a kind of alkaline marl. For raising\r\nthe nap, teasel does not seem to have been used, as with us, but a\r\nspecies of thorn (_spina fullonia_) the spines of which were mounted\r\nin a carding tool resembling a brush (_aena_); the skin of a hedgehog\r\nalso was sometimes utilized for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe fulling of new cloth involved seven or eight distinct\r\nprocesses,--washing with fuller's earth, or other cleansing agents, to\r\nremove the oily matter; beating and stretching, to make the surface\r\neven; washing and drying a second time, for cleaning and shrinking;\r\ncombing with a carding tool to raise the nap, brushing in order to\r\nmake it ready for clipping, and shearing to reduce the nap to proper\r\nlength; then, particularly in the case of the white woollens so\r\ncommonly used, bleaching with sulphur fumes; and finally, smoothing in\r\na large press. The process of cleaning soiled garments was more\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\nA series of paintings in the largest of the fulleries, on the west\r\nside of Mercury Street, picture several of these processes with great\r\nclearness. They were on a large pillar at the front end of the\r\nperistyle, from which they were removed to the Museum at Naples; they\r\nsupplement admirably the scenes of the Cupids' fullery in the house of\r\nthe Vettii, mentioned in a previous chapter (p. 335).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 225.--Scene in a fullery: treading vats.]\r\n\r\nIn the first picture (Fig. 225), the clothes are being washed. They\r\nare in four round treading vats, which stand in niches formed by a low\r\nwall. One of the workmen is still treading his allotment, steadying\r\nhimself by resting his arms on the walls of the niche at both sides;\r\nthe other three have finished treading and are standing on the bottom\r\nof their tubs, rinsing the garments before wringing them out.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 226.--Scene in a fullery: inspection of cloth;\r\n   carding; bleaching frame.]\r\n\r\nThe next scene (Fig. 226) is threefold. In the foreground at the left\r\nsits a richly dressed lady, to whom a girl brings a garment that has\r\nbeen cleaned; that the woman is not one of those employed in the\r\nfullery is evident from her elaborate headdress, necklace, and\r\nbracelets. In the background a workman dressed in a tunic is carding a\r\nlarge piece of cloth. Near by another workman carries on his shoulders\r\na bleaching frame, over which garments were spread to receive the\r\nfumes of the sulphur; he holds in his left hand the pot in which the\r\nbrimstone was burned. An owl, symbol of Minerva, who was worshipped by\r\nfullers as their patron divinity, sits upon the frame; and the man\r\nunderneath has on his head a wreath of leaves from the olive tree,\r\nwhich was sacred to the same goddess.\r\n\r\nIn the third picture a young man hands a garment to a girl; at the\r\nright a woman is cleaning a carding tool. The fourth (Fig. 227) gives\r\nan excellent representation of a fuller's press, worked by two upright\r\nscrews; it is so much like our modern presses as to need no\r\nexplanation. The festoons with which it is adorned are of olive\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 227.--A fuller's press.]\r\n\r\nWith these pictures before us, it will be easy to understand the plan\r\nof the fullery on the west side of Stabian Street, opposite the house\r\nof Caecilius Jucundus (Fig. 228). It was excavated in 1875. The\r\nbuilding was not originally designed for a fuller's establishment, but\r\nfor a private house, and part of the rooms were retained for domestic\r\nuse, as the well preserved kitchen (_d_), and some of the other rooms\r\nopening off from the atrium (_b_). The furniture of the atrium--a\r\ntable in front of the impluvium, with a pedestal for a fountain\r\nfigure, and a marble basin to receive the jet--is like that of the\r\nhouse the interior of which is shown in Plate VII.\r\n\r\nThe fuller's appliances are found in the shop next to the entrance\r\n(21), and in the peristyle (_q_). In the former are the foundations\r\nof three treading vats, and on the opposite side an oblong depression\r\nin which the press was placed. The peristyle contains three large\r\nbasins of masonry for soaking and rinsing the clothes. A jet of water\r\nfell into the one next the rear wall (3), from which it ran into the\r\nother two through holes in the sides. Along the wall is a raised walk\r\n(4) on a level with the top of the basins, into which the workmen\r\ndescended by means of steps. At the ends of this walk are places for\r\nseven treading vats, five in one group, two in the other. The wall\r\nabove is decorated with a long sketchy painting, in which the fullers\r\nare seen engaged in the celebration of a festival,--doubtless the\r\nQuinquatrus, the feast of Minerva; the celebration is followed by a\r\nscene before a magistrate, resulting from a fight engaged in by the\r\ncelebrants. A mass of fuller's earth was found in the passage at _m_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 228.--Plan of a fullery.]\r\n\r\nFrom the receipts found in the house of Caecilius Jucundus, it appears\r\nthat this thrifty Pompeian, in the years 56-60 A.D., rented a fullery\r\nbelonging to the city. In view of the nearness of this establishment\r\nto his house, it seems likely that he was in charge of the business\r\nhere. At the time of the eruption, however, the enterprise was in the\r\nhands of Marcus Vesonius Primus, who lived in the house next door (No.\r\n20), where a portrait herm, dedicated to him by his cashier\r\n(_arcarius_), stands in the atrium; the house is often called the\r\nhouse of Orpheus, from the large painting on the rear wall of the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nTo judge from the election notices painted on the front of the fullery\r\nand on the houses at either side, Primus must have taken an active\r\ninterest in local politics. He was an ardent partisan, as witness this\r\ninscription: _Cn. Helvium aed. d. r. p._ (for _aedilem, dignum re\r\npublica_) _Vesonius Primus rogat_,--'Vesonius Primus urges the\r\nelection of Gnaeus Helvius as aedile, a man worthy of public office.'\r\nThe endorsement of Gavius Rufus is even stronger: _C. Gavium Rufum II\r\nvir. o. v. f. utilem r. p. (duumvirum, oro vos, facite, utilem rei\r\npublicae) Vesonius Primus rogat_,--'Vesonius Primus requests the\r\nelection of Gaius Gavius Rufus as duumvir, a man serviceable to public\r\ninterests; do elect him, I beg of you.'\r\n\r\nIn one of the shorter recommendations, Primus names his occupation:\r\n_L. Ceium Secundum II v. i. d. Primus fullo ro[gat]_,--'Primus the\r\nfuller asks the election of Lucius Ceius Secundus as duumvir with\r\njudiciary authority.' On one occasion he united with his employees in\r\nfavoring a candidate for the aedileship: _Cn. Helvium Sabinum aed.\r\nPrimus cum suis fac[it]_,--'Primus and his household are working for\r\nthe election of Gnaeus Helvius Sabinus as aedile.'\r\n\r\nThe fullery on Mercury Street, like that just described, had been made\r\nover from a private house, built in the pre-Roman period. Among other\r\nchanges, the columns of the large peristyle were replaced by massive\r\npillars of masonry supporting a gallery above for the drying of\r\nclothes. At the rear are four square basins, the two larger of which\r\nare more than seven feet across; the water passed from one to the\r\nother as in the basins of Primus's fullery. In the corner near the\r\nlast basin are six rectangular niches for treading vats, separated by\r\na low wall, the purpose of which is clear from Fig. 225. There is a\r\nvaulted room at the right of the peristyle, with a cistern curb, a\r\nlarge basin of masonry, and a stone table. Here a substance was found\r\nwhich the excavators supposed to be soap, but which was doubtless\r\nfuller's earth, like that found in the establishment on Stabian\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were naturally fewer tanners than fullers; and so far only one\r\ntannery has been discovered. That is a large establishment, however,\r\nfilling almost an entire block near the Stabian Gate (Ins. I. v),\r\nexcavated in 1873. Like the two larger fulleries, it occupied a\r\nbuilding designed for a house. The appliances of the craft are found\r\nin only a small part of the structure; they relate to two\r\nprocesses,--the preparation of the fluids used for tanning, and the\r\nmanipulation of the hides.\r\n\r\nThe mixture for the tan vats was prepared in a tank under a colonnade\r\nopening on the garden. It could be drawn off through two holes in the\r\nside into a smaller basin below, or conducted by means of a gutter\r\nrunning along the wall to three large earthen vessels.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 229.--Plan of the vat room of the tannery.]\r\n\r\nThe vats, fifteen in number, are in a room formerly used as an atrium\r\n(Fig. 229). They are about 5 feet in diameter, and from 4 to about 51/2\r\nfeet deep; they were built of masonry, and plastered; two holes were\r\nmade in the side of each to serve as a convenience in climbing in and\r\nout. Between adjacent pairs of pits was an oblong basin about twenty\r\ninches deep, lined with wood. On either side of this was a large\r\nearthen jar, sunk in the earth; a small, round hole between the basin\r\nand each jar seems to mark the place of a pipe tile, connected with\r\nthe former at the bottom. The large pits were for ordinary tanning;\r\nthe oblong basins were probably used in making fine leather (_aluta_),\r\na process in which alum was the principal agent, the chemicals being\r\nplaced in the jars on either side, and supplied to the basins through\r\nthe pipe tiles.\r\n\r\nIn the same building four tools were found, similar to those used by\r\ntanners at the present time. One was a knife, of bronze, with a\r\ncharred wooden handle on the back of the blade; two were scraping\r\nirons, with a handle on each end; and there was another iron tool with\r\na crescent-shaped blade.\r\n\r\nThe garden on which the colonnade opened contains an open-air\r\ntriclinium. The table was ornamented with a mosaic top, now in the\r\nNaples Museum, with a characteristic design (Fig. 230). The principal\r\nmotive is a skull; below is a butterfly on the rim of a wheel, symbols\r\nof the fluttering of the disembodied soul and of the flight of time.\r\nOn the right and on the left are the spoils that short-lived man\r\nleaves behind him,--here a wanderer's staff, a wallet, and a beggar's\r\ntattered robe; there, a sceptre, with a mantle of royal purple. Over\r\nall is a level, with the plumb line hanging straight, symbolic of\r\nFate, that sooner or later equalizes the lots of all mankind. The\r\nthought of the tanner, or of the earlier proprietor of the house, is\r\neasy to divine: _Mors aurem vellens, Vivite, ait, venio_,\r\n\r\n     'Death plucks my ear, and says,\r\n       \"Live!\" for I come.'\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 230.--Mosaic top of the table in the garden of the\r\n   tannery.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX\r\n\r\n_INNS AND WINESHOPS_\r\n\r\n\r\nWineshops, _cauponae_, were numerous in Pompeii, and the remains are\r\neasily identified. Like the Italian _osterie_, they were at the same\r\ntime eating houses, but the arrangements for drinking were the more\r\nconspicuous, and give character to the ruins. The Roman inn,\r\n_hospitium_, or simply _caupona_, was a wineshop with accommodations\r\nfor the night, provision being also made in most cases for the care of\r\nanimals. Keepers of inns, _caupones_, are frequently mentioned in\r\nPompeian inscriptions, sometimes in election notices, more often in\r\ngraffiti.\r\n\r\nSeveral inns have been identified from signs and from scribblings on\r\nthe walls within. At the entrance of one (west side of Ins. IX. vii)\r\nis painted _Hospitium Hygini Firmi_, 'Inn of Hyginius Firmus.' The\r\nfront of the 'Elephant Inn' (west side of Ins. VII. i) was ornamented\r\nwith the painting of an elephant in the coils of a serpent, defended\r\nby a pygmy. The name of the proprietor is perhaps given at the side:\r\n_Sittius restituit elephantu[m]_, 'Sittius restored the elephant,'\r\nreferring no doubt to the repainting of the sign. Evidently the owner,\r\nwhether Sittius or some one else, was anxious to rent the premises;\r\nbelow the elephant is the painted notice: _Hospitium hic\r\nlocatur--triclinium cum tribus lectis_,--'Inn to let. Triclinium with\r\nthree couches.' The rest of the inscription is illegible.\r\n\r\nThe plan of another inn in the same region (west side of VII. xii)\r\nwell illustrates the arrangements of these hostelries (Fig. 231). The\r\nmain room (_a_), which probably served as a dining room, is entered\r\ndirectly from the street. At one side is the kitchen (_h_); six\r\nsleeping rooms (_b-g_) open upon the other sides. But the landlord did\r\nnot provide merely for the entertainment of guests from out of town;\r\nhe endeavored to attract local patronage also, by means of a wineshop\r\n(_n_), which opened upon the street and had a separate dining room\r\n(_o_). A short passage (_i_) led from the main room to the stalls\r\n(_k_), in front of which was a watering trough. The vehicles were\r\nprobably crowded into the recess at _m_, or the front of _a_. The two\r\nside rooms (_l_ and _p_) were closets.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 231.--Plan of an inn.]\r\n\r\nThe walls of several of the rooms contain records of the sojourn of\r\nguests. C. Valerius Venustus, 'a pretorian of the first cohort,\r\nenrolled in the century of Rufus,' scratched his name on the wall of\r\n_c_, to which also an affectionate husband confided his loneliness:\r\n'Here slept Vibius Restitutus all by himself, his heart filled with\r\nlongings for his Urbana.' Four players, one of them a Martial, passed\r\na night together in the same apartment. In the next room (_d_) a\r\npatriotic citizen of Puteoli left a greeting for his native town:\r\n'Well be it ever with Puteoli, colony of Nero, of the Claudian line;\r\nC. Julius Speratus wrote this.' This city, as we learn from Tacitus,\r\nreceived permission from Nero to call itself Colonia Claudia\r\nNeronensis. Lucifer and Primigenius, two friends, spent a night in\r\nroom _f_, Lucceius Albanus of Abellinum (Avellino) in _g_.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of rooms here is so unlike that of an ordinary house\r\nthat the building must have been designed at the beginning for a\r\ntavern. Sometimes a dwelling was turned into an inn, as in the case of\r\nthe house of Sallust, which, as we have seen, in the last years of the\r\ncity must in part at least have been used as a hostelry.\r\n\r\nInns near the gates had a paved entrance for wagons, interrupting the\r\nsidewalk. A good example is the inn of Hermes, in the first block on\r\nthe right as one came into the city by the Stabian Gate (Fig. 232). On\r\neither side of the broad entrance (_a_), are winerooms (_b_, _d_).\r\nBehind the stairway at the right, which leads from the street to the\r\nsecond story, is a hearth with a water heater. On the wall at the left\r\nwas formerly a painting with the two Lares and the Genius offering\r\nsacrifice; below was the figure of a man pouring wine from an amphora\r\ninto an earthen hogshead (_dolium_), and beside it was written\r\n_Hermes_, apparently the name of the proprietor. The wagons stood in\r\nthe large room at the rear (_f_), with which the narrow stable (_k_)\r\nis connected; in one corner is a watering trough of masonry. On the\r\nground floor were only three sleeping rooms (_e_, _g_, and _h_), but\r\nthere were upper rooms at the rear, reached by a flight of stairs in\r\n_f_; these were probably not connected with the upper rooms of the\r\nfront part, which (over _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_), having a street\r\nentrance, may have been rented separately.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 232.--Plan of the inn of Hermes.]\r\n\r\nThe Pompeian inns were doubtless fair representatives of their class\r\nin the different Roman cities. Those of Rome must have been numerous,\r\nbut are rarely mentioned, and innkeepers are generally referred to in\r\nterms of disrespect. The ordinary charges seem to have been low, and\r\nthe accommodations were of a corresponding character. Owing to the\r\nuniversal custom of furnishing private entertainment to all with whom\r\nthere existed any ground of hospitality, places of public\r\nentertainment tended to become the resorts of the vicious.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 233.--Plan of a wineshop.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe wineshop of which the plan is here given (Fig. 233) is on the east\r\nside of Mercury Street, at the northwest corner of Ins. VI. x. It was\r\ndesigned not only for the accommodation of guests who would go inside\r\nto partake of refreshments, but also for the sale of drinks over the\r\ncounter to those who might stop a moment in passing. This is evident\r\nfrom the arrangement of the main room (_a_), which has a long counter\r\nin front, with a series of small marble shelves arranged like stairs\r\non one end of it, for the display of cups and glasses; on the other is\r\na place for heating a vessel over a fire. Large jars are set in the\r\ncounter, in which liquids and eatables could be kept. In the corner of\r\nthe room, at the right as one enters, a hearth is placed. In view of\r\nthe provision for heating water, we are safe in calling this a\r\n_thermopolium_, a wineshop which made a specialty of furnishing hot\r\ndrinks. The passage at the rear of the hearth (_c_) is connected with\r\na small room (_d_) and also with the adjoining house, which may have\r\nbeen the residence of the proprietor, or may have been used for\r\nlodgings.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 234.--Scene in a wineshop. Wall painting.]\r\n\r\nThe long room with an entrance from the side street (_b_, now walled\r\nup) was intended for the use of those who preferred to eat and drink\r\nat their leisure. The walls are decorated with a series of paintings\r\npresenting realistic scenes from the life of such places. We see the\r\nguests eating, drinking, and playing with dice. Some are standing,\r\nothers sitting on stools; it is the kind of public house that Martial\r\ncalls a 'stool-ridden cookshop,' in which couches were not provided,\r\nbut only seats without backs (Mart. Ep. V. lxx. 3).\r\n\r\nIn one of the scenes (Fig. 234) four men are drinking, about a round\r\ntable, while a boy waits on them; two of the figures have pointed\r\nhoods like those seen to-day in Sicily and some parts of Italy.\r\nStrings of sausage, hams, and other eatables hang from a pole\r\nsuspended under the ceiling.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 235.--Delivery of wine. Wall painting.]\r\n\r\nSome of the figures in the pictures are accompanied by inscriptions.\r\nThus by the side of a guest for whom a waiter is pouring out a glass\r\nof wine is written: _Da fridam pusillum_, 'Add cold water--just a\r\nlittle.' In a similar connection we read, _Adde calicem Setinum_,\r\n'Another cup of Setian!' The Setian wine came from a town in Latium at\r\nthe foot of the hills bordering the Pontine Marshes, now Sezze; we\r\ninfer that our wineshop sold not merely the products of neighboring\r\nvineyards, but choice brands from other regions as well. Wines from\r\nthe locality were probably brought to town in amphorae; the delivery\r\nof a consignment from a distance is shown in a separate scene (Fig.\r\n235), in which amphorae are being filled from a large skin on a wagon;\r\nthe team of mules is meanwhile resting, unharnessed, the yoke hanging\r\non the end of the pole.\r\n\r\nThe pictures present the life of a tavern from the point of view of\r\nthe landlord; but occasionally we have a suggestion of the other side,\r\nas in the following couplet, the faulty spelling of which we can\r\nforgive on account of its pithiness: _Talia te fallant utinam\r\nme[n]dacia, copo, Tu ve[n]des acuam et bibes ipse merum_,--\r\n\r\n     'Landlord, may your lies malign\r\n       Bring destruction on your head!\r\n     You yourself drink unmixed wine,\r\n       Water sell your guests instead.'\r\n\r\nThe wineshop in which this graffito is found (I. ii. 24) is larger\r\nthan that on Mercury Street, and has several dining rooms. Connected\r\nwith it is a garden with a triclinium, once shaded by vines, which\r\ncalls to mind the invitation of the barmaid in the Copa:--\r\n\r\n     'Here a garden you will find,\r\n       Cool retreat, with cups and roses,\r\n     Lute and pipe, for mirth designed,\r\n       Bower that mask of reeds encloses.\r\n\r\n     'Come, weary traveller, lie and rest\r\n       'Neath the shade of vines o'er-spreading.\r\n     Wreath of roses freshly pressed\r\n       On your head its fragrance shedding.'\r\n\r\nAll the pictures found in Pompeian wineshops bear out the inference,\r\nbased upon numerous allusions in classical writers, that such places\r\neverywhere were in the main frequented by the lower classes; among the\r\nadjectives applied to taverns by the poets are 'dirty,' 'smoky,' and\r\n'black.' They were haunted by gamblers and criminals, and the life was\r\nnotoriously immoral.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLAN V.--THE STREET OF TOMBS.]\r\n\r\nKEY TO THE LEFT SIDE\r\n\r\n     24.

Only a few\r\nhave been uncovered; how many still lie concealed under the mantle of\r\nvolcanic debris that rests upon the plain, no one has yet ventured to\r\nconjecture. The tombstone of a magistrate of one of the suburbs was\r\nfound at Scafati, a mile and a half east of the ancient town; and\r\nothers have been brought to light on the east, south, and west sides.\r\nThe most interesting and best known tombs are those of the Street of\r\nTombs, in front of the Herculaneum Gate; but important remains have\r\nbeen found also near the Stabian and Nocera gates, and burial places\r\nof a humbler sort lie along the city wall near the Nola Gate.\r\n\r\nMost of the tombs thus far excavated belong to the Early Empire,\r\nhaving been built between the reign of Augustus and 79 A.D. Two or\r\nthree date from the end of the Republic; and a small corner of an\r\nOscan cemetery has been uncovered on the northwest side of the city.\r\nRemains of skeletons were found only in the Oscan graves; the Roman\r\nburial places were all arranged with reference to the practice of\r\ncremation, the ashes being deposited in urns.\r\n\r\nThe tombs present so great a variety of form and construction that it\r\nis impossible to classify them in a summary way, or to dismiss them\r\nwith the presentation of two or three typical examples. The character\r\nof the monument varied not merely according to the taste and means,\r\nbut also according to the point of view or religious feeling of the\r\nbuilder. Some deemed it more fitting that the ashes of the dead should\r\nbe covered over with earth; others preferred to place them in a\r\nconspicuous tomb that would please the eye and impress the imagination\r\nof the beholder. To many the matter of paramount importance seemed to\r\nbe the provision for the worship of the dead, the arrangement of the\r\ntomb so that offerings could easily be made to the ashes. Others still\r\ndesired to have the sepulchre convenient for the living, who at times\r\nwould gather there, and tarry near the resting place of the departed.\r\nAnd there were not a few who attempted, in the construction of a\r\nmonument, to accomplish at the same time several of these ends. The\r\narchitectural designs were suggested by the form of an altar, a\r\ntemple, a niche, a commemorative arch, or a semicircular bench,\r\n_schola_.\r\n\r\nOn account of this diversity of aim and of type, it will be most\r\nconvenient to study the tombs in topographical groups, commencing with\r\nthose at the northwest corner of the city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe highway that passes under the Herculaneum Gate runs almost\r\ndirectly west, descending with a gentle grade. Above it on the north\r\nside is the ridge formed by the stream of lava on the end of which the\r\ncity lay; here, before the eruption, were sightly villas. Below, to\r\nthe south, was the sea, not so far away as now, over the shimmering\r\nsurface of which the traveller, as he rode along, could catch charming\r\nglimpses of the heights above Sorrento and of Capri. A short distance\r\nfrom the gate on the left, a branch road, which for convenience we may\r\ncall the Bay Road, led directly to the sea. Another branch, on the\r\nright, followed the direction of the city wall; further from the gate\r\non the same side, a third, which may be designated as the Vesuvius\r\nRoad, ran off from the highway in the direction of the mountain. The\r\nhighway itself, so far as excavated, has been named the Street of\r\nTombs.\r\n\r\nThe tombs that have been uncovered here are distributed in four\r\ngroups. The first, on the left side, extends from the gate to the Bay\r\nRoad; it comprises Nos. 1-4a on Plan V. The second, on the right\r\n(Nos. 1-9), includes the tombs between the gate and the beginning of\r\nthe Vesuvius Road. The third group, on the left, lies between the\r\nruins of the villa to which the name of Cicero has been attached and\r\nthe villa of Diomedes; the tombs are numbered on the plan 16-23. The\r\nmonuments of the fourth group occupy the tongue of ground at the right\r\nbetween the highway and the Vesuvius Road (33-43). The outer parts of\r\nthe two villas by which the continuity of the series of tombs on both\r\nsides is interrupted, appear to have been used as inns; along the\r\nstreet in front of each there was a colonnade supported by pillars,\r\nbehind which were small rooms opening toward the street.\r\n\r\nAt the further end of the villa on the right (10-29) is the potter's\r\nworkshop (29-30), mentioned in a previous chapter (p. 386). Beyond\r\nthis are the Oscan graves (31-32), several of which have been\r\nexplored. In them were found rough stone coffins, made of slabs and\r\nfragments of limestone, containing remains of skeletons together with\r\nsmall painted vases, of the sort manufactured in Campania in the third\r\nand second centuries B.C. Two coins were found, in separate graves,\r\nwith Oscan legends that have not yet been deciphered; apparently they\r\nwere from Nola. The burial places lie close together, and evidently\r\nbelong to a cemetery for people of humble station; there are no\r\nheadstones to mark the graves. This is the only place at Pompeii in\r\nwhich painted vases have been found.\r\n\r\nA narrow strip of land on each side of the road belonged to the city,\r\nand burial lots therein were granted by the municipal council to\r\ncitizens who had rendered public service. Others, however, might\r\nobtain lots by purchase; private ownership may be assumed unless the\r\ngift of the city is indicated in the inscription. The location of\r\nseveral tombs--1, 3, 4, 6 on the right, 3 on the left--shows that the\r\ndirection of the street near the gate was changed after sepulchral\r\nmonuments had begun to be erected.\r\n\r\nAn interesting inscription referring to the municipal ownership of\r\nland was found at the further corner of the Bay Road: _Ex auctoritate\r\nimp. Caesaris Vespasiani Aug. loca publica a privatis possessa T.\r\nSuedius Clemens tribunus causis cognitis et mensuris factis rei\r\npublicae Pompeianorum restituit_,--'By virtue of authority conferred\r\nupon him by the Emperor Vespasian Caesar Augustus, Titus Suedius\r\nClemens, tribune, having investigated the facts and taken\r\nmeasurements, restored to the city of Pompeii plots of ground\r\nbelonging to it which were in the possession of private individuals.'\r\n\r\nTo judge from the location of the inscription, the land which the\r\nmilitary tribune sent as commissioner by Vespasian gave back to the\r\ncity, must have been at the sides of the Bay Road. A marble statue of\r\na man dressed in a toga and holding a scroll in his hand, was found\r\nnear by. It was probably a portrait of Suedius Clemens, and may have\r\nstood in a niche in the villa of Cicero.\r\n\r\nThere is an implied reference to the Bay Road also in another\r\ninscription which was found out of its proper place, in the court of\r\nthe adjoining inn: THERMAE . M . CRASSI . FRVGI . AQVA . MARINA .\r\nET . BALN . AQVA . DVLCI . IANVARIVS . L--'Bathing establishment of\r\nMarcus Crassus Frugi. Warm sea baths and freshwater baths.\r\n(Superintendent) the freedman Januarius.' We learn from Pliny the\r\nElder that M. Licinius Crassus Frugi, who was consul in 64 A.D., and\r\nwas afterwards (in 68) put to death by Nero, owned a hot spring which\r\ngushed up out of the sea. This spring, then, was at Pompeii, and was\r\nutilized for baths. The inscription is at the same time an\r\nadvertisement and a sign directing people down the Bay Road to the\r\nbath house.\r\n\r\nA general view of the Street of Tombs is given in Plate X. It is taken\r\nfrom the high ground beyond the fourth group, as one looks toward the\r\nHerculaneum Gate. The rugged mass of Monte Sant' Angelo looms up in\r\nthe distance; at the right the trees skirting the edge of the\r\nexcavations form an effective background. The beauty of the\r\nsurroundings, especially on a summer morning, the associations of the\r\nstreet, its deserted appearance, and the unbroken, oppressive\r\nstillness give rise to mingled feelings of pleasure and sadness in the\r\nvisitor.\r\n\r\nWe commence our survey with the first group of tombs at the left as\r\none passes out from the Herculaneum Gate. Close by the gate is the\r\ntomb of Cerrinius Restitutus (1 on the plan, left side). It is simply\r\na low vaulted niche, having seats at the sides. Against the rear wall\r\nstood a marble tombstone, with a place for a carved portrait; in front\r\nof it was a small altar under which doubtless was placed the urn\r\ncontaining the ashes. Both altar and tombstone (now in the Naples\r\nMuseum) have the inscription: _M. Cerrinius Restitutus, Augustalis,\r\nloc. d. d. d._ (for _locus datus decurionum decreto_),--'Marcus\r\nCerrinius Restitutus, member of the brotherhood of Augustus. Place of\r\nburial granted by vote of the city council.' The tomb here was\r\ndesigned as a structure to which relatives might repair on anniversary\r\ndays in order to make offerings to the dead.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 236.--Sepulchral benches of Veius and Mamia; tombs\r\n   of Porcius and the Istacidii.]\r\n\r\nThe remains of the other tombs in the first group are shown in the\r\naccompanying illustration (Fig. 236). We notice first two large\r\nsemicircular benches. That at the left (2 on the plan) marks the\r\nresting-place of Veius. It is of tufa, and nearly twenty feet wide at\r\nthe front. The ends are modelled to represent winged lion's paws, the\r\ncarving of which is full of vigor and may be compared with that of the\r\nlion's paws in the Small Theatre (Fig. 70). The statue that once stood\r\nat the rear, on a high pedestal, has disappeared, but the inscription\r\nremains: _A. Veio M. f. II vir. i. d. iter. quinq. trib. milit. ab\r\npopulo ex d. d._,--'To the memory of Aulus Veius, son of Marcus, twice\r\nduumvir with judiciary authority, quinquennial duumvir, military\r\ntribune by the choice of the people. (Erected) by order of the city\r\ncouncil.' The city not only gave a burial place, but built the tomb\r\nas well. The cinerary urn was probably placed in the earth in the\r\nnarrow unwalled space behind the bench.\r\n\r\nThis monument was intended at the same time to do honor to the dead\r\nand render service to the living. Here, on feast days of the dead,\r\nrelatives could gather and partake of a commemorative meal; but at all\r\ntimes the inviting seat and conspicuous statue served to maintain that\r\nfriendly relation with the living, the desire for which so often finds\r\nexpression in Roman epitaphs. The portrait and inscription made it\r\nseem as if Veius himself offered a friendly greeting to those that\r\npassed by, and was greeted by them in turn as they looked upon his\r\nface and read his name.\r\n\r\nThe other bench (4) was evidently built by the heirs of a priestess,\r\nMamia, upon a lot given by the city. The inscription appears in large\r\nletters on the back of the seat: _Mamiae P. f. sacerdoti publicae;\r\nlocus sepultur[ae] datus decurionum decreto_,--'To the memory of\r\nMamia, daughter of Publius Mamius, priestess of the city. Place of\r\nburial granted by order of the municipal council.' In this instance,\r\nalso, the cinerary urn was probably buried in the earth behind the\r\nbench. A certain delicacy in the modelling of the lion's paws seems to\r\nindicate for this monument a somewhat later date than that of the\r\nmonument to Veius,--possibly the end of the reign of Augustus, or the\r\nreign of Tiberius. The date of erection is not given in the case of\r\nany Pompeian tomb.\r\n\r\nBetween the two benches we see a lava base and the core of a\r\nsuperstructure; they belong to the tomb of Marcus Porcius. The name is\r\nknown from a boundary inscription which appears on two small blocks of\r\nlava at the corners of the lot in front: _M. Porci M. f. ex dec.\r\ndecret. in frontem ped. xxv, in agrum ped. xxv_,--'(Lot) of Marcus\r\nPorcius son of Marcus, granted by order of the city council;\r\ntwenty-five feet front, twenty-five feet deep.'\r\n\r\nThis Porcius may have been one of the builders of the Small Theatre\r\nand the Amphitheatre, or a son of that Porcius, whose name appears on\r\nthe altar of the temple of Apollo. The tomb was in the form of an\r\naltar; the terminal volutes at the top, of travertine, have been\r\npreserved. The sides were of tufa blocks, which may have been carried\r\noff for building purposes after the tomb was damaged by the earthquake\r\nof 63. The interior was made hollow to save expense; there was no\r\nsepulchral chamber, the ashes being placed in the earth under the\r\nmonument. This tomb is the oldest of the group.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 237.--The tomb of the Istacidii, restored.]\r\n\r\nThe conspicuous monument of the   (4_a_) stands behind the\r\ntombs of Mamia and Porcius, at the left of the Bay Road. It is raised\r\nupon a narrow terrace, enclosed by a balustrade of masonry, and has\r\nthe appearance of a temple, with half-columns at the sides. The\r\nremains of the lower story alone are seen in Fig. 236; above this was\r\na circular structure formed by columns supporting a roof, under which\r\nwere placed statues of members of the family (Fig. 237). The lower\r\nstory contains a sepulchral chamber, entered by a door at the rear; in\r\nthe middle of the chamber is a massive pillar reaching to the vaulted\r\nceiling. The decoration of the room is simple, of the third style. On\r\none side is a large niche, for two urns, those of the head of the\r\nfamily and his wife; the other three sides contain ten smaller niches.\r\n\r\nThe principal inscription of the tomb has not been found, but a number\r\nof names are preserved on the commemorative stones set up in the plot\r\nof ground about it. These stones are of a peculiar type, met with\r\nelsewhere only at Capua and Sorrento; we shall call them bust stones.\r\nThe outline resembles that of a human head and neck terminating below\r\nin a pillar, but the front was left smooth, and an inscription was cut\r\nor painted on the bust. Difference of sex was indicated by the\r\ntreatment of the hair; an example maybe seen in Fig. 240. The bust\r\nstones of men are generally larger than those of women; those of\r\nchildren are still smaller, the size perhaps varying with the age.\r\n\r\nThe bust stones here may refer to those whose ashes were deposited in\r\nurns in the tomb, or to others whose urns were buried in the plot of\r\nground in which it stands. From them we learn that the head of the\r\nfamily was Numerius Istacidius, and that he had a daughter, Istacidia\r\nRufilla, who was a priestess. Representatives of two other families,\r\nthe Melissaei and the Buccii, are named on similar stones found in a\r\nplot connected with that of the Istacidii at the rear. The three\r\nfamilies were perhaps closely connected by intermarriage. The bust\r\nstone of one of the Melissaei, Gnaeus Melissaeus Aper, duumvir in 3-4\r\nA.D., stood in the same enclosure with those of the Istacidii.\r\n\r\nOnly one of the nine tombs in the second group (2) bears a name. In\r\nthe case of two (3 and 4) the superstructure has completely\r\ndisappeared, leaving only the lava bases in place. Another (5) has not\r\nbeen excavated; the front of the burial lot has been cleared, but the\r\nmonument, lying further back, is still covered.\r\n\r\nThe first tomb lies in the angle between the highway and the branch\r\nroad along the wall, which was evidently laid out after the monument\r\nwas erected. It has the form of an altar, and must have resembled in\r\nappearance the tomb of Porcius on the opposite side of the street.\r\nHere, however, there is a sepulchral chamber in the base, entered by a\r\nlow, narrow passage, which was closed until 1887 by a block of stone.\r\nIn corners of this chamber two cinerary urns, in lead cases, were\r\nfound covered with earth and with the remains of a funeral pyre--bits\r\nof wood and iron nails used in building the pyre, together with pieces\r\nof a richly carved ivory casket and broken perfume vials of terra\r\ncotta. Among the fragments of bone in each urn was a coin of Augustus.\r\nThough the ashes of the dead were here placed in a burial vault, it\r\nwas nevertheless considered important to cover them with earth. It was\r\nnot thought necessary, however, to leave the vault accessible for the\r\nperformance of sacred rites in honor of the dead; the entrance,\r\nsecurely closed, was only to be unsealed for the admission of new\r\nurns.\r\n\r\nThe next tomb (2) is of an entirely different type from any of those\r\npreviously described. It is an unroofed enclosure, entered by a door\r\nat one end. As we learn from the inscription, it was built in honor of\r\nTerentius Felix by his widow, the city furnishing the burial lot and a\r\ncontribution of two thousand sesterces (about $90) toward the expense:\r\n_T. Terentio T. f. Men. Felici maiori aedil[i]; huic publice locus\r\ndatus et [=HS] [M] [M]. Fabia Probi f. Sabina uxor_,--'To the memory of\r\nTitus Terentius Felix the Elder, son of Titus, of the tribe Menenia,\r\naedile. The place of burial was given by the city, with two thousand\r\nsesterces. His wife, Fabia Sabina, daughter of Fabius Probus (built\r\nthis monument).' Pompeians who were Roman citizens were enrolled in\r\nthe tribe Menenia.\r\n\r\nThe cinerary urn of Felix was of glass. It was protected by a lead\r\ncase and placed in an earthen jar, which was buried in the earth under\r\na small altar or table of masonry against the wall on the left as one\r\nenters. Here also was a tombstone, with the inscription, 'To the elder\r\nTerentius'; he probably left a son with the same name. In the urn, or\r\nnear it, were found two coins, one of Augustus, the other of Claudius,\r\ndeposited to pay the fare of Charon. The right side of the enclosure\r\nwas set off by a low wall; here several urns belonging to other\r\nmembers of the household were buried. Shells of oysters and other\r\nshellfish were found in the main room, remains of a banquet in honor\r\nof the dead; the libations were poured upon the earth above the urns.\r\nThe plan of this tomb closely resembles that of the enclosure in front\r\nof the Doric temple in the Forum Triangulare (p. 139).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 238.--View of the Street of Tombs.\r\n\r\n   At the left, the Bay Road and remains of the so-called villa of\r\n   Cicero; at the right, Garland tomb, foundation of the tomb of the Blue\r\n   Glass Vase, and semicircular niche.]\r\n\r\nOf the remaining tombs of the second group, two are prominent, and may\r\nreadily be distinguished in the accompanying illustration (Fig. 238),\r\nthe so-called Garland tomb (6 on the plan), and the roofed\r\nsemicircular niche at the end (9). The Garland tomb has the shape of a\r\ntemple, with pilasters instead of columns, between which hang festoons\r\nof leaves and flowers. It is solid; the cinerary urn was probably\r\nplaced underneath. The form of the second story cannot be determined.\r\nThe material is tufa, coated with white stucco, and the monument is\r\none of the oldest in the series, dating from the end of the Republic.\r\n\r\nAdjoining the Garland tomb is a simple sepulchral enclosure (7) with\r\nan entrance from the street. Between this and the roofed niche we see\r\nin Fig. 238 the limestone base of a tomb, like those seen in Plate X,\r\nat the right; the altar-shaped superstructure has disappeared (8).\r\nThis is called the tomb of the Blue Glass Vase. The base contains a\r\nsepulchral chamber, entered by a door at the rear. Here three urns,\r\ntwo of glass and one of terra cotta, were found, standing in niches.\r\nOn the floor were several statuettes, a couple of small figures of\r\nanimals, and a mask with a Phrygian cap,--all of terra cotta.\r\n\r\nIn beauty of material, harmony of design, and skill of workmanship,\r\none of the glass urns, which gave the name to the tomb and is now\r\npreserved in the Naples Museum, ranks with the finest examples of its\r\nclass in the world. Among specimens of ancient glass it stands second\r\nonly to the famous Portland vase in the British Museum, which was\r\nfound in a tomb near Rome. The urn has the form of an amphora; the\r\nsupport seen at the bottom (Fig. 239) is modern. It is decorated with\r\nreliefs cut in a layer of pure white on a background of dark blue.\r\nNear the bottom is a narrow band, showing goats and sheep in pasture.\r\nResting on this are two bacchic masks, on opposite sides of the vase;\r\nvines laden with clusters rise in graceful arabesques above the masks,\r\ndividing the body of the vase into two fields, which present scenes\r\nfrom the vintage.\r\n\r\nOne of these scenes is reproduced in Fig. 239. The vintage is\r\ninterpreted as a festival of Bacchus. Above is a festoon of fruits and\r\nflowers. At the sides are two boys on elevated seats, one playing the\r\ndouble flute, the other holding a Pan's pipe in his hands, ready to\r\ntake his turn; the grapes are gathered and pressed to an accompaniment\r\nof Bacchic airs, the two players following each other with alternate\r\nstrains. A third boy, treading the grapes in a round vat, shakes the\r\nthyrsus in honor of the Wine-god, while a companion empties in fresh\r\nbunches. The scene is full of action; no reproduction can do justice\r\nto the delicacy and finish of the original.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 239.--Glass vase with vintage scene, found in the\r\n   tomb of the Blue Glass Vase.]\r\n\r\nA bench of masonry runs along the inner wall of the semicircular niche\r\n(9), which is covered by a roof in the form of a half dome and opens\r\nupon the street as do the large unroofed monuments of Veius and Mamia.\r\nA blank marble tablet was placed in the gable; the builder of the\r\nmonument, who was doubtless living at the time of the eruption,\r\npreferred to leave it to his heirs to add the memorial inscription,\r\nbut the disaster interfered with the fulfilment of his wishes. It was\r\nprobably intended to bury the cinerary urn either in the floor of the\r\nniche or in the ground at the rear. The effect of the double series of\r\npilasters at the corners, placed one upon the other without an\r\nintervening entablature, and of the fantastic stucco decoration of the\r\ngable, is not unpleasing, although the designs are far from classical;\r\nthe tiles shown in the illustration are modern. The inner wall is\r\npainted in red and black panels; the vaulted ceiling, from which the\r\nstucco has now fallen, was moulded to represent a shell.\r\n\r\nBoth the niche and the tomb of the Blue Glass Vase seem to have\r\nbelonged to the adjoining villa. The stucco decoration of the villa in\r\nits main features is identical with that of the niche; and the plot of\r\nground behind the tombs is connected by a gateway with a garden of the\r\nvilla (12 on the plan), which was too richly adorned to have been\r\nintended for the use of the occupants of the inn. In the middle of the\r\ngarden was a pavilion supported by four mosaic columns (now in the\r\nNaples Museum), similar to that in the garden of the villa of\r\nDiomedes, and to others belonging to city houses. A mosaic fountain\r\nniche was made in the rear wall facing the entrance from the street,\r\nand in two corners were short columns on which were placed small\r\nfigures,--on one a boy with a hare, in marble, on the other a frog of\r\nglazed terra cotta.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the garden seems to possess a distinctly sepulchral\r\ncharacter. Besides the entrances from the tombs and from the street,\r\nthere was a third, which led into a court of the villa, with which the\r\nperistyle and living rooms were connected by a passageway; in the\r\ncorner of the court nearest the garden, and facing the entrance from\r\nthe street (15), was an elaborate domestic shrine, dedicated, as shown\r\nby the symbolical decoration, to Apollo, Bacchus, Hercules, and\r\nMercury. The relation of the garden with the living rooms of the villa\r\nwas only indirect; and we conclude that it was intended for gatherings\r\nand sacred rites in honor of the dead. Relatives could partake of the\r\nsepulchral banquet under the pavilion.\r\n\r\nThe tombs of the third group, as may be seen from Plate X, form a\r\nstately series. The prevailing type is that which was in vogue at the\r\ntime of the destruction of the city--a high base, with marble steps at\r\nthe top leading up to a massive superstructure in the form of an\r\naltar, faced with marble. The burial plot was enclosed by a low wall.\r\nIn the base of the tomb was a sepulchral chamber, entered by a door in\r\nthe rear or at one side; it was now the custom for relatives to enter\r\nthe burial vault when they wished to pour libations on the ashes.\r\n\r\nThe first of the series (16 on the plan, seen in Plate X next to the\r\ncypress) was unfinished at the time of the eruption. Part of the\r\nmarble veneering had not yet been added, the walls of the sepulchral\r\nchamber were in the rough, and there were no urns in the five niches\r\ndesigned for their reception. In the burial plot surrounding the tomb,\r\nhowever, a marble bust stone was found (Fig. 240) with the\r\ninscription, _Iunoni Tyches Iuliae Augustae Vener[iae]_,--'To the\r\nGenius of Tyche, slave of Julia Augusta,--of the cult of Venus.'\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 240.--Bust Stone of Tyche, slave of Julia\r\n   Augusta.]\r\n\r\nThe reference is plainly to a female slave of Livia, the wife of\r\nAugustus; how her ashes came to be deposited here it is not worth\r\nwhile, in default of information, to conjecture. In sepulchral\r\ninscriptions of women _Iunoni_ sometimes takes the place of _genio_ in\r\nmen's epitaphs. Tyche was seemingly a member of a sisterhood for the\r\nworship of Venus, to which, as to the organization of the 'Servants of\r\nMercury and Maia,' and of the 'Servants of Fortuna Augusta,' slaves\r\nwere admitted.\r\n\r\nThe tomb of Umbricius Scaurus (17) is conspicuous by reason of its\r\nsize and noteworthy on account of its decoration. The inscription on\r\nthe front of the altar-shaped superstructure gives interesting details\r\nin regard to the man the memory of whom is here perpetuated: _A.\r\nUmbricio A. f. Men. Scauro, II vir i. d.; huic decuriones locum\r\nmonum[ento] et [=HS] [M] [M] in funere et statuam equestr[em in f]oro\r\nponendam censuerunt. Scaurus pater filio_,--'To the memory of Aulus\r\nUmbricius Scaurus son of Aulus, of the tribe Menenia, duumvir with\r\njudiciary authority. The city council voted the place for a monument\r\nto this man and two thousand sesterces toward the cost of the funeral;\r\nthey voted also that an equestrian statue in his honor should be set\r\nup in the Forum. Scaurus the father to the memory of his son.'\r\n\r\nWhy these honors were conferred upon Scaurus, who probably became a\r\nduumvir early in life and died soon after his term of office, is not\r\nclear. The upper part of the base of the tomb in front was adorned\r\nwith stucco reliefs--now for the most part gone--in which gladiatorial\r\ncombats and a venatio were depicted; but a painted inscription along\r\nthe edge of one of the scenes indicates that the show thus\r\ncommemorated was given by another man, _N. Fistius Ampliatus; Munere\r\n[N. Fis]ti Ampliati die summo_. Perhaps the last two words mean that\r\n'on the last day' the younger Scaurus, a relative or friend of\r\nAmpliatus, shared the cost of the exhibition under some such\r\narrangement as that between Lucretius Valens and his son (p. 222). If\r\nthis be the correct explanation, it is evident that Scaurus could have\r\ngiven no shows in the Amphitheatre during his duumvirate, else the\r\nfather would have taken pains to mention the fact in the inscription.\r\nHis term of office may have come after the year 59, when such\r\nexhibitions were prohibited at Pompeii for ten years (p. 220).\r\n\r\nThe gladiatorial scenes, if space permitted, would merit a detailed\r\npresentation--they are so full of human interest. Two gladiators are\r\nfighting on horseback, the rest on foot. The vanquished with uplifted\r\nthumbs are mutely begging for mercy. The plea of some of them is heeded\r\nby the populace; in other groups we see the victor preparing to give the\r\ndeath thrust. Beside each gladiator was painted his name, school, and\r\nnumber of previous combats, as in a programme; and letters were added to\r\ngive the result of this fight. One combatant, who was beaten and yet by\r\nthe vote of the audience permitted to live, died on the sand from his\r\nwounds. We see him resting on one knee, faint from loss of blood; the\r\nletter M beside his name, for _missus_, is followed by the death sign\r\n[Theta], the first letter of the Greek word for death, [Greek: THANATOS].\r\n\r\nThe animals shown in the venatio are mainly wild boars and bears, but\r\nwe recognize also a lion and a bull. Lions were doubtless much more\r\nrarely seen in such exhibitions at Pompeii than at Rome.\r\n\r\nAs more attention came to be given to the outward appearance of tombs,\r\nless was bestowed upon the adornment of the sepulchral chamber. So in\r\nthe tomb of Scaurus the burial vault is low, cramped, and with plain\r\nwhite walls. A massive pillar, as in the tomb of the Istacidii,\r\nsupports the vaulted ceiling. It is pierced by two openings, forming\r\nfour niches, two on each side. Three of these, when the tomb was\r\nopened, were closed by panes of glass, and there were traces of a\r\ncurtain that hung over the one opposite the entrance. There were\r\nfourteen other niches in the walls at the sides.\r\n\r\nNo name is associated with the third tomb (18 on the plan) which, as\r\nshown by Plate X, is simply a large cylinder of masonry, the top of\r\nwhich probably had the shape of a truncated cone; the material is\r\nbrick, with a facing of white stucco lined off to give the appearance\r\nof blocks of marble. The base is square; the enclosing wall is adorned\r\nwith miniature towers. The structure illustrates in its simplest form\r\nthe type of the massive tomb, or mausoleum, found at Rome; we are at\r\nonce reminded of the imposing monument of Caecilia Metella on the\r\nAppian Way, and of Hadrian's Mausoleum in the city.\r\n\r\nA blank tablet was placed by the builder on the front of the enclosing\r\nwall to receive an inscription after his death. The heirs, however,\r\npreferred to put the memorial on the tomb itself, where the place of\r\nan inscription is plainly seen, the slab itself having disappeared.\r\nThe sepulchral chamber is in the superstructure; it was decorated with\r\nsimple designs in the fourth style on a white ground. There were only\r\nthree niches, perhaps for father, mother, and child; the urns were let\r\ninto the bottoms of the niches, as often in the Roman columbaria.\r\n\r\nOne of the miniature towers on the enclosing wall is ornamented with a\r\nrelief presenting a singular design; a woman in mourning habit is\r\nlaying a fillet on a skeleton reclining on a heap of stones (Fig.\r\n241). The scene may be interpreted as symbolizing the grief of a\r\nmother for a dead son.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE X.--THE STREET OF TOMBS, LOOKING TOWARD THE\r\n   HERCULANEUM GATE]\r\n\r\nThere is only a simple bust stone in the burial lot (19) beyond the\r\nround monument. Next comes the beautiful tomb of Calventius Quietus\r\n(20), which may be seen in Plate X, as well as the tomb of Naevoleia\r\nTyche (22; further to the right). Between these two is a walled\r\nenclosure (21) without a door, in which are three bust stones. The\r\nlargest stone bears the name N. Istacidius Helenus; in front of one of\r\nthe others a small jar was set to receive offerings for the dead. On\r\nthe front of the enclosing wall is a tablet on which the names of N.\r\nIstacidius Januarius and of Mesonia Satulla appear with that of\r\nHelenus; they were all freedmen of the Istacidii (p. 412).\r\n\r\nThe monuments of Quietus and of Tyche are the finest examples of the\r\naltar type at Pompeii. Both are ornamented in good taste, but the\r\ncarvings of the former are more delicate, while the motives of the\r\nlatter are more elaborate. Quietus was a man of some prominence, as we\r\nsee from the epitaph: _C. Calventio Quieto Augustali; huic ob\r\nmunificent[iam] decurionum decreto et populi conse[n]su bisellii honor\r\ndatus est_,--'To the memory of Gaius Calventius Quietus, member of the\r\nBrotherhood of Augustus. On account of his generosity the honor of a\r\nseat of double width was conferred upon him by the vote of the city\r\ncouncil and the approval of the people.'\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 241.--Relief, symbolic of grief for the dead.]\r\n\r\nAt the Theatre and the Amphitheatre, Quietus had the privilege of\r\nsitting on a bisellium, as if he were a member of the city council.\r\nBelow the inscription is a representation of the 'seat of double\r\nwidth,' shown in Fig. 242. The square footstool at the middle implies\r\nthat the seat was intended for a single person. The ends of the tomb\r\nwere ornamented with finely carved reliefs of the civic crown, which\r\nwas made of oak leaves and awarded to those who had saved the life of\r\na Roman citizen (Fig. 243). As the inscription does not record any\r\ndeed of valor, it may be that the crown is used here merely as a\r\ndecorative device.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 242.--Front of the tomb of Calventius Quietus,\r\n   with bisellium.]\r\n\r\nThough the monument of Quietus was built in the last years of the\r\ncity, when such structures were generally provided with sepulchral\r\nchambers, it has no burial vault, and the enclosing wall is without a\r\ndoor. It is perhaps a cenotaph, a monument erected in honor of a man\r\nwhose remains were interred elsewhere; it is also possible that\r\nQuietus had no relatives who wished to have an accessible sepulchral\r\nchamber in order to make libations to his ashes, and that for this\r\nreason the monument was made solid, the urn being buried in the earth\r\nunderneath. The small turrets on the enclosing wall were adorned with\r\nreliefs; among them Oedipus solving the riddle of the Sphinx, and\r\nTheseus after the slaughter of the Minotaur. The suggestion is\r\nobvious: he who is commemorated here had solved the riddle of\r\nexistence, had found an exit from the labyrinth of life.\r\n\r\nAround the front and sides of the tomb of Naevoleia Tyche runs a\r\nborder of acanthus arabesques, forming panels in which reliefs are\r\nplaced. The border in front is interrupted at the middle of the upper\r\nside by the portrait of Tyche; the lower half of the panel is devoted\r\nto a ceremonial scene in which offerings appear to be made to the\r\ndead, while in the upper half, under the portrait, we read the\r\ninscription: _Naevoleia L. lib[erta] Tyche sibi et C. Munatio Fausto\r\nAug[ustali] et pagano, cui decuriones consensu populi bisellium ob\r\nmerita eius decreverunt. Hoc monimentum Naevoleia Tyche libertis suis\r\nlibertabusq[ue] et C. Munati Fausti viva fecit_,--'Naevoleia Tyche,\r\nfreedwoman of Lucius Naevoleius, for herself and for Gaius Munatius\r\nFaustus, member of the Brotherhood of Augustus and suburban official,\r\nto whom on account of his distinguished services the city council,\r\nwith the approval of the people, granted a seat of double width. This\r\nmonument Naevoleia Tyche built in her lifetime also for the freedmen\r\nand freedwomen of herself and of Gaius Munatius Faustus,' who was\r\nseemingly her husband.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 243.--End of the tomb of Naevoleia Tyche, with\r\n   relief of a ship entering port; beyond, end of the tomb of Calventius\r\n   Quietus, with the civic crown.]\r\n\r\nThe bisellium of Faustus is shown in one of the end panels; in the\r\nother we see a ship sailing into port (Fig. 243). The carving of the\r\nrelief is bold, though crude; we see the sailors furling the sail, as\r\nthe vessel glides into still water. The scene is symbolical of\r\ndeath,--the entrance of the soul after the storms of life into a haven\r\nof rest. The thought is expressed by Cicero with deep feeling in his\r\nessay on Old Age: 'As for myself, I find the ripening of life truly\r\nagreeable; the nearer I come to the time of death, the more I feel\r\nlike one who begins to see land and knows that sometime he will enter\r\nthe harbor after the long voyage.'\r\n\r\nThe sepulchral chamber of this tomb has a large niche opposite the\r\nentrance; the urn standing in it apparently contained the cinerary\r\nremains of two persons, Tyche and Faustus. Other urns were found in\r\nthe smaller niches in the walls and on the bench of masonry along the\r\nsides. Three were of glass, protected by lead cases; one of them is\r\nshown in Fig. 244. They contained ashes and fragments of bone, with\r\nremains of a liquid mixture, which was shown by chemical analysis to\r\nhave consisted of water, wine, and oil. Lamps were found on the bench,\r\none for each urn, and there were others in a corner; they were used on\r\nanniversary days to light the chamber.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 244.--Cinerary urn in lead case.]\r\n\r\nThe last monument consists of a walled enclosure, with a table and\r\ncouches of masonry like those often found in the gardens of private\r\nhouses (Fig. 245). In front of the table is a small round altar for\r\nlibations. This was a place for banquets in honor of the dead,\r\n_triclinium funebre_; a tomb designed to serve the convenience of the\r\nliving, like the niche of Cerrinius Restitutus and the benches of\r\nVeius and Mamia. The walls were painted in the last style.\r\n\r\nOver the entrance in front we read: _Cn. Vibrio Q. f. Fal. Saturnino\r\nCallistus lib._,--'To the memory of Gnaeus Vibrius Saturninus son of\r\nQuintus, of the tribe Falerna; erected by his freedman Callistus.' As\r\nSaturninus did not belong to the tribe Menenia, he was very likely not\r\na native of Pompeii. His ashes were probably placed in an urn and\r\nburied in the earth between the altar and the entrance.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to suppose that the series of tombs on the south\r\nside of the highway is continued beyond the villa of Diomedes; but it\r\nhas not yet been found possible to carry the excavations further in\r\nthat direction.\r\n\r\nThe tombs of the fourth group present no new types of design or\r\nconstruction. Several of them are of interest, however, on account of\r\npeculiarities of arrangement. At the time of the eruption two of the\r\nmonuments (33, 35) were in process of building; it is impossible to\r\ntell what form they were to have. A third (36) had been commenced on a\r\nlarge scale, but apparently the money of the heirs gave out, and\r\nlittle pyramids were set up at the corners of the walled enclosure,\r\nthe urns being buried in the earth.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 245.--Sepulchral enclosure with triclinium\r\n   funebre.]\r\n\r\nTwo of the monuments were erected for children (40, 41). They stand\r\nnear together on the high ground in the angle formed by the Vesuvius\r\nRoad. They are small vaulted niches, ornamented with reliefs in white\r\nstucco, most of which has fallen off. The urn in each was placed in\r\nthe earth under the bottom of the niche, with a small pipe tile\r\nleading to the surface, through which libations could be poured down\r\nupon it. A tablet is set in the sustaining wall at the side of the\r\nstreet below the larger niche (41), with the simple inscription, _N.\r\nVelasio Grato, vix[it] ann. XII_,--'To the memory of Numerius Velasius\r\nGratus, who lived twelve years.' The inscription belonging to the\r\nother niche was even more simple, giving no first name: _Salvius puer\r\nvixit annis VI_,--'The boy Salvius lived six years.'\r\n\r\nOne tomb (34) is noteworthy on account of its door. This has the\r\nappearance of a double door, but it is made of a single slab of\r\nmarble, and swings, like an ordinary Roman door, by means of pivots\r\nwhich are fitted into sockets in the threshold and lintel. It was also\r\nprovided with a lock. The exterior of the tomb was unfinished; the\r\nreticulate masonry still lacked its facing of more costly material.\r\nThe sepulchral chamber, however, contained several cinerary urns; one\r\nof them, of alabaster, was in a large niche facing the entrance, and a\r\ngold seal ring, with the figure of a deer in an intaglio, was found in\r\nit among the ashes and fragments of bone. There were also several\r\nlamps, a small altar of terra cotta, and a few glass perfume vials.\r\nTwo amphorae, of the sort used for wine, stood against the sides of\r\nthe chamber; such were sometimes utilized as repositories for ashes.\r\n\r\nOne of the volutes of the well preserved limestone tomb of M. Alleius\r\nLuccius Libella (37) is seen in Plate X. The monument has the shape of\r\nan altar, and is apparently solid. It was erected by the widow, Alleia\r\nDecimilla, priestess of Ceres, in memory of her husband, who was\r\nduumvir in 26 A.D., and of a son of the same name, who was a member of\r\nthe city council and died in his eighteenth year. The burial plot was\r\ngiven by the city. As no opening was left in the monument, Decimilla\r\nevidently planned to have her ashes deposited in another tomb, perhaps\r\nthat of her father's family.\r\n\r\nThe remaining four tombs are of the same type; the idea is that of a\r\ntemple, the columnar construction being suggested not by projecting\r\nhalf-columns, as in the tomb of the Istacidii, but by more or less\r\nprominent pilasters at the corners and on the sides. Two of the tombs\r\n(38 and 39) stand where the tongue of land between the highway and the\r\nVesuvius Road begins to descend to the level of the pavement.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the tomb of Ceius Labeo (38) are shown in Plate X (in\r\nthe foreground, at the left). The appearance of this monument was\r\nsomewhat like that of the Istacidii; there was a second story, the\r\nroof of which was supported entirely by columns; between these,\r\nstatues of members of the family were placed, of both men and women,\r\nsome of marble, others of tufa coated with stucco. The base was\r\nornamented with stucco reliefs, which have almost entirely\r\ndisappeared; above, in front, were two portrait medallions.\r\n\r\nThe large sepulchral chamber can be seen in the plate. The floor was\r\nmore than six feet below the surface of the ground. A vaulted niche in\r\nthe rear wall was connected with the outside by means of a small\r\nopening at the top, through which libations could be poured or\r\nofferings dropped upon the urn below. In the vicinity of the monument\r\nwas found the inscription: _L. Ceio L. f. Men. Labeoni iter[um] d. v.\r\ni. d. quinq[uennali] Menomachus l[ibertus]_,--'To the memory of Lucius\r\nCeius Labeo son of Lucius, of the tribe Menenia, twice duumvir with\r\njudiciary authority, also quinquennial duumvir; erected by his\r\nfreedman, Menomachus.'\r\n\r\nThere were bust stones in the plot belonging to this monument, and\r\nalso about the adjoining tomb (39); the names of those whose ashes\r\nwere deposited under the stones, in part, at least, seem to have been\r\npainted upon the base of Labeo's tomb, but they were illegible at the\r\ntime of excavation. The adjoining tomb (39) is without a name, but was\r\nbuilt after that erected in honor of Labeo.\r\n\r\nThe tombs at the end of the fourth group (42, 43) belong to one\r\nhousehold. In the sustaining wall along the highway a sepulchral\r\ntablet of tufa is seen with the inscription: _Arriae M. f. Diomedes\r\nl[ibertus] sibi suis_,--'Diomedes, a freedman, for Arria, daughter of\r\nMarcus Arrius, for himself and for his family.' On the elevation\r\ndirectly above is his tomb, the end of which is seen in Plate X (in\r\nthe foreground). It bears the inscription: _M. Arrius [^C]. l. Diomedes\r\nsibi suis memoriae, magister pag[i] Aug[usti] Felic[is]\r\nsuburb[ani]_,--'Marcus Arrius Diomedes, freedman of Arria, magistrate\r\nof the suburb Pagus Augustus Felix, in memory of himself and his\r\nfamily.'\r\n\r\nThe abbreviation [^C]. l. takes the place of _Gaiae libertus_, 'freedman\r\nof Gaia,' the letter C, which stands for Gaius, being reversed; Gaia\r\nis used, as in legal formulas, to show that the person referred to is\r\na woman. The slave Diomedes, after receiving his freedom, was entitled\r\nto the use of the family name, and was known as Marcus Arrius\r\nDiomedes. His mistress, as Roman ladies generally, was called not by a\r\nfirst name, but by the feminine form of the family name, Arria, which\r\nwas as plainly suggested to a Roman reading the name Arrius followed\r\nby the symbol as if it had been written in full.\r\n\r\nOn the front of the tomb we observe in stucco relief two bundles of\r\nrods, _fasces_, with axes, having reference to the official position\r\nof Diomedes as a magistrate of a suburb. The axes are quite out of\r\nplace. Suburban officers did not have the 'power of life and death';\r\nthe lictors of such magistrates carried bundles of rods without axes.\r\nThe vain display of authority reminds one of the pompous petty\r\nofficial held up to ridicule by Horace in his Journey to Brundisium;\r\nit suggests also the rods and axes painted on the posts at the\r\nentrance of the dining room of Trimalchio, in Petronius's novel. The\r\ntomb was constructed without a burial vault, but there were two bust\r\nstones near by with names of freedmen of Diomedes.\r\n\r\nThe monument to Arria (43) lies further back; it fronts on the\r\nVesuvius Road. Diomedes found a way to reconcile happily his own love\r\nof display with his duty to his former mistress; he built a larger\r\nmonument for her, but chose for his own the more conspicuous position.\r\nThe small sepulchral chamber of Arria's tomb contained nothing of\r\ninterest and is now walled up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI\r\n\r\n_BURIAL PLACES NEAR THE NOLA, STABIAN, AND NOCERA GATES_\r\n\r\n\r\nNo part of the highway leading from the Nola Gate has yet been\r\nexcavated. In the year 1854, however, excavations were made for a\r\nshort distance along the city wall near this gate, and thirty-six\r\ncinerary urns were found buried in the earth. In or near them were\r\nperfume vials of terra cotta with a few of glass. Here in the\r\npomerium, the strip of land along the outside of the walls, which was\r\nleft vacant for religious as well as practical reasons, the poor were\r\npermitted to bury the ashes of their dead without cost. In some cases\r\nthe place of the urn was indicated by a bust stone; often the spot was\r\nkept in memory merely by cutting upon the outside of the city wall the\r\nname of the person whose ashes rested here.\r\n\r\nThere was another cemetery of the poor a short distance southwest of\r\nthe Amphitheatre, south of the modern highway. It lay along a road\r\nwhich branched off from the highway leading to Stabiae and ran east in\r\nthe direction of Nocera. Sepulchral remains were found here in\r\n1755-57, and again in 1893-94, when further explorations were made.\r\nThey consist of cinerary urns, buried in the earth, with small glass\r\nperfume vials in or near them, and a bust stone to mark the spot. A\r\nfew of the stones are of marble and bear a name; the great majority\r\nare roughly carved out of blocks of lava, and if a name was painted on\r\nthe front it has disappeared.\r\n\r\nOf special significance, in connection with these burial places, is\r\nthe arrangement for making offerings to the dead. In order that\r\nlibations might be poured directly upon the cinerary urns, these were\r\nconnected with the surface of the ground by means of tubes. In one\r\ninstance a lead pipe ran from above into an opening made for it in the\r\ntop of the lead case inclosing an urn. More often the connection was\r\nmade by means of round tiles; in the case of one urn, three tiles were\r\njoined together, making a tube five feet long. The upper end of the\r\nlibation tube did not project from the ground, but was placed just\r\nbelow the surface and covered with a flat stone; over this was a thin\r\nlayer of earth, which the relatives would remove on the feast days of\r\nthe dead. Pagan antiquity was never able to dissociate the spirit of\r\nthe dead from the place of interment; the worship of ancestors was in\r\nno small degree the product of local associations.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of these remains is a sepulchral monument of modest\r\ndimensions, which, as we learn from the tablet over the entrance, was\r\nerected by Marcus Petasius Dasius in memory of his two sons, Severus\r\nand Communis, and of a freedwoman named Vitalis. There was no floor in\r\nthe burial chamber; the urns were placed in the earth and marked by\r\nbust stones, among which was one set up for Dasius himself, with the\r\ninitials M. P. D.\r\n\r\nThe Stabian Road has been excavated for but a short distance near the\r\ngate. The only monuments completely cleared are two large,\r\nsemicircular benches, like those of Veius and Mamia (p. 409). At the\r\nrear of each is a small sepulchral enclosure in which the urns were\r\nburied. The memorial tablet belonging to the monument nearest the gate\r\nhas disappeared, but two boundary stones at the corners of the lot\r\nbear the inscription: _M. Tullio M. f. ex d[ecurionum]\r\nd[ecreto]_,--'To Marcus Tullius son of Marcus, in accordance with a\r\nvote of the city council.' The Tullius named was perhaps the builder\r\nof the temple of Fortuna Augusta (p. 132).\r\n\r\nThe inscription of the second bench, like that of Mamia, is cut in\r\nlarge letters on the back of the seat: _M. Alleio Q. f. Men. Minio, II\r\nv. i. d.; locus sepulturae publice datus ex d. d._,--'To the memory of\r\nMarcus Alleius Minius son of Marcus, of the tribe Menenia, duumvir\r\nwith judiciary authority. The place of burial was given in the name of\r\nthe city by vote of the municipal council.'\r\n\r\nA third bench, close to the second, lies under a modern house and has\r\nnot been uncovered. Further from the gate a rectangular seat, probably\r\nbelonging to the same series of monuments, was discovered in 1854, it\r\nwas built in memory of a certain Clovatius, duumvir, as shown by a\r\nfragment of an inscription that came to light at the same time. From\r\nstill another tomb are reliefs with gladiatorial combats, now in the\r\nNaples Museum.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of those near the Herculaneum Gate, the most\r\nimportant tombs yet discovered at Pompeii are in a group beyond the\r\nAmphitheatre, excavated in 1886-87. They are six in number, and lie\r\nclose together on both sides of a road which ran east from the Nocera\r\nGate, bending slightly to the north (Fig. 246). This road was not in\r\nuse in the last years of the city; the stones of the pavement and\r\nsidewalk had been removed. The monuments, however, were large and\r\nstately, erected by people of means, and the ruins are characteristic\r\nand impressive. The tombs were built of common materials, stucco being\r\nused on exposed surfaces instead of marble. The simplicity of\r\nconstruction, and the shapes of the letters in the election notices\r\nand other inscriptions painted on them, suggest a relatively early\r\ndate, which is confirmed by the age of the coins found in the urns;\r\nthe monuments belong to the early decades of the Empire.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 246.--Plan of the tombs east of the Amphitheatre.]\r\n\r\nThe first tomb at the right (No. 1 on the plan) was built in the form\r\nof a commemorative arch, with pilasters at the corners. Above was a\r\nlow cylinder surmounted by a truncated cone, on which stood a terminal\r\nmember in the shape of a pine cone, found near by. The cinerary urn\r\nwas buried in the earth below an opening in the floor of the passage\r\nunder the arch (shown in the plan). No name appears in connection with\r\nthis monument.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 247.--View of two tombs east of the Amphitheatre.\r\n   That at the left is No. 3 on the plan; the next is No. 4.]\r\n\r\nAnother monument of the arch type, that of Mancius Diogenes, is seen\r\non the opposite side of the street (5; Fig. 248). The structure is\r\nshallow, the vaulted opening low. On the top of the arch were three\r\nniches, in which stood three travertine statues; two of these, both of\r\nwomen, have been preserved, and are of indifferent workmanship. A\r\nmarble tablet was placed in front, over the vault, with the\r\ninscription, _P. Mancio P. l[iberto] Diogeni ex testamento arbitratu\r\nManciae P. l[ibertae] Dorinis_,--'To the memory of Publius Mancius\r\nDiogenes, freedman of Publius Mancius; (the monument was erected) in\r\naccordance with the terms of his will, under the direction of Mancia\r\nDoris, freedwoman of Publius Mancius.'\r\n\r\nThere is a curious ambiguity in this inscription; we cannot tell\r\nwhether Doris, seemingly the wife of Diogenes, was manumitted by the\r\nPublius Mancius who gave him his freedom, or by Diogenes himself after\r\nhe had gained his freedom and was entitled to use the name Publius\r\nMancius. Four bust stones stood in front of the tomb and two at the\r\nrear, arranged as indicated on the plan; those in front are seen in\r\nour illustration.\r\n\r\nThe tomb at the left of that just described (4; Fig. 247) is of\r\ninterest as showing the result of an attempt to blend the arch type\r\nwith that of the temple. A passage roofed with a flat vault runs\r\nthrough the middle of the first story. The second story had the\r\nappearance of a diminutive temple with four Corinthian columns in\r\nfront. The niche representing the cella was of the full width of the\r\ntomb, and occupied two thirds of the depth; the other third was given\r\nto the portico. Four statues of tufa coated with stucco that were\r\nfound here probably stood under the portico or in the intercolumniations,\r\nwhere they would best be seen from below; three were statues of men,\r\nthe fourth of a woman.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the five bust stones in the vaulted passage is\r\nindicated on the plan. The three nearest the street entrance bear the\r\nname of a freedman, _L. Caesius L. l. Logus_,--'Lucius Caesius Logus,\r\nfreedman of Lucius Caesius,' and of Titia Vesbina and Titia Optata,\r\nboth evidently freedwomen manumitted by a lady named Titia. We are\r\nprobably safe in assuming that the two inmost stones, without names,\r\nare those of Caesius and Titia, husband and wife, who gave Logus,\r\nVesbina, and Optata their freedom, and built the monument. It was not\r\nnecessary to place the names of the builders upon the commemorative\r\nstones, because they were doubtless given in the memorial tablet in\r\nfront, which has disappeared. Coins of Augustus and Tiberius were\r\nfound in the urns.\r\n\r\nOne tomb (2) has the form of a niche, resembling those of the two\r\nchildren near the end of the Street of Tombs (p. 425), but larger and\r\nmore costly than they. The corners are embellished with three-quarter\r\ncolumns, which have Doric flutings and composite capitals. On the\r\nwalls at the entrance we see, modelled in stucco, doorposts with\r\ndouble doors swung back. Two marble bust stones, the places of which\r\nare indicated on the plan, show where the urns of the two most\r\nimportant members of the family, Apuleius and his wife Veia, were\r\nburied; their names doubtless appeared in an inscription on the front\r\nof the monument. In one of the urns was found a coin of Tiberius of\r\nthe year 10 A.D. The other was enclosed in a lead case, and a lead\r\nlibation tube was extended from the ashes through both covers to the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe names of Apuleius and Veia are obtained from two other bust\r\nstones, in front of the niche. One reads, _Festae Apulei f[iliae]\r\nvix[it] ann[os] XVII_,--'To the memory of Festa, daughter of Apuleius,\r\nwho lived seventeen years.' The other has simply _[C]onviva Veiaes vix.\r\nan. XX_,--'Conviva, slave of Veia, lived twenty years.' An as of the\r\ntime of the Republic was found in the urn of Conviva; and a square\r\ntile, the upper end of which was closed by a piece of marble, served\r\nas a libation tube for the urn of Festa.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 248.--Two other tombs east of the Amphitheatre.\r\n   Nos. 5, 6 on the plan.]\r\n\r\nThe two remaining tombs are of the temple type, one (3; Fig. 247)\r\nhaving pilasters at the corners, the other half-columns at the corners\r\nand on the sides (6). The first has a vaulted sepulchral chamber,\r\nentered from the rear. On the inside of the wall next the street are\r\nthree low niches, the top of which is nearly on a level with the\r\nsidewalk; each of them contained an urn. Directly over the inner\r\nniches, in the outside of the wall and opening toward the street, are\r\nthree other niches, shown in the illustration, in the bottom of which\r\nwere libation tubes leading to the urns below. Relatives could thus\r\npour their offerings of wine or oil upon the urns without entering the\r\nsepulchral chamber. Lava bust stones were placed against the back of\r\nthe outer niches. The hair on one of them is treated in a manner to\r\nindicate that a woman is represented. The entrance of the tomb was\r\nclosed by a large block of lava. On account of the arrangement for\r\noffering libations from the outside, it was not necessary to make the\r\nburial vault easy of access.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the other tomb (6; Fig. 248) was in front, and closed\r\nby a door of limestone. It led, not to a sepulchral chamber, but to a\r\nstairway by which one ascended to the second story. Here statues were\r\nplaced, but the exact form of the upper part cannot be determined. The\r\nfinding of five tufa capitals suggests that the second story may have\r\nbeen a columnar structure, like that of the tomb of the Istacidii;\r\nwhen the excavations are carried further east enough other fragments\r\nwill perhaps be found to make a complete restoration possible. One of\r\nthe statues is of a man holding a roll of papyrus in his hand, with a\r\nround manuscript case, _scrinium_, at his feet.\r\n\r\nAmong the inscriptions painted on these tombs were two, relating to\r\ngladiatorial combats, which have already been mentioned (p. 221). One\r\nof the election notices, oddly enough, refers to a candidate for an\r\noffice in Nuceria: _L. Munatium Caeserninum Nuceriae II vir. quinq. v.\r\nb. o. v. f._ (for _duumvirum quinquennalem, virum bonum, oro vos,\r\nfacite_),--'Make Lucius Caeserninus quinquennial duumvir of Nuceria, I\r\nbeg of you, he's a good man.' As long as the relations of the\r\nPompeians and Nucerians were friendly, the highway between the two\r\ntowns was doubtless much travelled by the citizens of both places.\r\n\r\nIf the visitor pauses to think of the religious feeling which the\r\nancients manifested generally in relation to their burial places, it\r\ngives somewhat of a shock to see notices even of a semi-public\r\ncharacter painted in bright red letters upon tombs. All such\r\ninscriptions, however, are surpassed in ludicrous incongruity with the\r\npurpose of the monument by the following advertisement regarding a\r\nstray horse: _Equa siquei aberavit cum semuncis honerata a. d. VII\r\nKal. Septembres_ (corrected into _Decembres_), _convenito Q. Deciu[m]\r\nQ. l. Hilarum ... L. l. ... chionem, citra pontem Sarni fundo\r\nMamiano_,--'If anybody lost a mare with a small pack-saddle, November\r\n25, let him come and see Quintus Decius Hilarus, freedman of Quintus\r\nDecius, or ... (the name is illegible), freedman of Lucius, on the\r\nestate of the Mamii, this side of the bridge over the Sarno.' The two\r\nfreedmen were very likely in partnership, working a farm belonging to\r\nthe family, one representative of which we have already met, Mamia the\r\npriestess (p. 410).\r\n\r\nA more serious desecration of burial places, after offerings to the\r\ndead ceased to be made by relatives, or a family became extinct, was\r\nprobably not uncommon. Different families had different gods, and\r\nthose of one household were quite independent of those of another.\r\nOrdinarily a man had no reason to fear or respect the gods of his\r\nneighbor; notwithstanding the associations of worship connected with\r\ntombs, the general feeling toward them was very different from that\r\nmanifested toward temples, where local divinities or the great gods\r\nwere worshipped. The most stringent regulations of the emperors could\r\nnot prevent the ransacking of the tombs about Rome for objects of\r\nvalue, and the removal of their materials of construction for building\r\npurposes. The superstructure of two of the monuments near the\r\nHerculaneum Gate had disappeared apparently before the destruction of\r\nthe city, and of the tomb of Porcius only the core remained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V\r\n\r\nPOMPEIAN ART\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII\r\n\r\n_ARCHITECTURE_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding pages the principal buildings of Pompeii have been\r\ndescribed, and reference has been made to many works of art. We shall\r\nnow offer a few observations of a more general nature in regard to the\r\nremains of architecture, sculpture, and painting.\r\n\r\nThe different periods in the architectural history of the city have\r\nbeen defined in a previous chapter. The most significant of these,\r\nfrom every point of view, is that which we have called the Tufa\r\nPeriod, which corresponds roughly with the second century B.C. Its\r\nimportance is chiefly due to the fact that it records for us a phase\r\nof architectural development, a style, of which only slight traces are\r\nfound elsewhere,--in the East. It is the last offshoot of untrammelled\r\nHellenistic art in the field of construction; the architecture of the\r\nfollowing period was still derived from Hellenistic sources, but was\r\ndominated by Roman conceptions, and received from Rome the impulse\r\nthat determined the direction of its development. The remains of the\r\nTufa Period at Pompeii furnish materials for a missing chapter in the\r\nhistory of architecture.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the stone preferred in this period for all purposes\r\nwas the gray tufa. Where used for columns, pilasters, and\r\nentablatures, it was covered with stucco; in plain walls it appeared\r\nin its natural color. Unfortunately, the covering of stucco is\r\npreserved in only a few cases; the best example is presented by an\r\nIonic capital in the first peristyle of the house of the Faun. The\r\nstucco was generally white, but color was sometimes employed, as in\r\nthe Corinthian columns and pilasters of the exedra in the same house,\r\nwhich are painted a deep wine red.\r\n\r\nNo other period of Pompeian art shows in an equal degree the impress\r\nof a single characteristic and self-consistent style, alike in public\r\nbuildings, temples, and private houses, in the interior decoration as\r\nwell as in the treatment of exteriors. The wall decoration of the\r\nfirst style is simply the adaptation of tufa construction to\r\ndecorative use. The motives are identical. The forms are the same, but\r\nthese naturally appear in a freer handling upon interior walls, the\r\neffect being heightened by the use or imitation of slabs of marble of\r\nvarious colors.\r\n\r\nThis style throughout gives the impression of roominess and largeness.\r\nIt is monumental, especially when viewed in contrast with the later\r\narchitecture of Pompeii. No building erected after the city became a\r\nRoman colony can be compared, for ample dimensions and spatial\r\neffects, with the Basilica. In the same class are the temples of\r\nJupiter and Apollo, with the impressive two-storied colonnades\r\nenclosing the areas on which they stand; the contrast with the later\r\ntemples, as those of Fortuna Augusta and Vespasian, is striking. All\r\nthe more important houses of this period are monumental in design and\r\nproportions, with imposing entrances, large and lofty atriums, and\r\nhigh doors opening upon the atrium; the shops in front also were high,\r\nand in two stories.\r\n\r\nIn point of detail, the architecture of the Tufa Period reveals less\r\nof strength and symmetry than its stately proportions and modest\r\nmaterial would lead us to expect. The ornamentation is a debased\r\ndescendant of the Greek. It is characterized by superficial elegance,\r\ntogether with an apparent striving after simplicity and an\r\nill-concealed poverty of form and color. Though the ornamental forms\r\nstill manifest fine Greek feeling, they lack delicacy of modelling and\r\nvigor of expression. They are taken from Greek religious architecture,\r\nbut all appreciation of the three orders as distinct types, each\r\nsuited for a different environment, has disappeared. In consequence,\r\nwe often find a mixture of the orders, a blending of Doric, Ionic, and\r\nCorinthian elements; and still more frequently do we meet with a\r\nmarked departure from the original proportions.\r\n\r\nThus in the court of the temple of Apollo and in the first peristyle\r\nof the house of the Faun we see Ionic columns supporting a Doric\r\nentablature; in the house of the Black Wall, Doric columns with an\r\nIonic entablature. The Doric architrave, contrary to rule, appears\r\ndivided into two stripes, not only in the colonnade of the Forum,\r\nwhere the stripes represent a difference of material, but also in the\r\nhouse of the Faun, where the architrave is represented as composed of\r\nsingle blocks reaching from column to column (p. 51). In the Palaestra\r\n(p. 165), and in many private houses, the Doric column was lengthened,\r\nin a way quite out of harmony with the original conception, in order\r\nto make it conform to the prevailing desire for height and slender\r\nproportions. The shaft nowhere appears with the pronounced entasis and\r\nstrong diminution characteristic of the type, and the capital has lost\r\nthe breadth and graceful outline of the Greek Doric.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 249.--Four-faced Ionic capital. Portico of the\r\n   Forum Triangulare.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 250.--Capital of pilaster. Casa del duca\r\n   d'Aumale.]\r\n\r\nThe Ionic columns in the cella of the temple of Jupiter (p. 65) are of\r\nthe Greek type, with volutes on two sides; elsewhere we find only the\r\nso-called Roman Ionic, with four volutes, a type that appears in\r\nseveral well defined and pleasing examples. One of these, a capital\r\nfrom the portico at the entrance of the Forum Triangulare, is shown in\r\nFig. 249. The deep incisions of the egg-and-dart pattern, which give\r\nthe egg almost the appearance of a little ball, is characteristic; it\r\nis found only at Pompeii, and there not after the Tufa Period. A still\r\nfreer handling of the Ionic is seen in the capital of a pilaster in\r\nthe casa del duca d'Aumale (Fig. 250).\r\n\r\nThe Corinthian capital appears in the usual forms, but the projecting\r\nparts are shallow, on account of the lack of resisting qualities in\r\nthe stone. The best examples are the capitals of the columns and\r\npilasters of the exedra in the house of the Faun. The workmanship here\r\nis fine, the realistic treatment of the acanthus leaves being\r\nespecially noteworthy. An interesting series of variations from the\r\nnormal type is seen in the capitals of the pilasters at house\r\nentrances; we have already met with a striking example of this series,\r\nornamented with projecting busts of human figures (Fig. 178). The\r\ndesign is often so fantastic that the essential character of the\r\nCorinthian capital seems entirely lost sight of.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 251.--Altar in the court of the temple of Zeus\r\n   Milichius.]\r\n\r\nThe entablatures of the temples built in the Tufa Period, as of those\r\nerected in later times, have all perished. The entablatures of the\r\ncolonnades, however, are at least in part well preserved in a number\r\nof instances, and are of two types, the Doric, characterized by the\r\nuse of triglyphs, and the Ionic, distinguished by the dentils of the\r\ncornice.\r\n\r\nBoth types are found also in the wall decoration, the first rarely,\r\nthe second very frequently. On the altar of the temple of Zeus\r\nMilichius, which is of tufa coated with stucco, the Doric entablature\r\nappears in association with the characteristic decoration of the first\r\nstyle, the imitation of large blocks of marble; on the top are\r\nterminal volutes of Ionic origin, as generally upon Roman altars and\r\naltar-shaped tombs (Fig. 251). On walls decorated in the first style,\r\nhowever, only Ionic entablatures are seen,--sometimes even twice upon\r\nthe same wall, as in the example shown in Fig. 122. From this we infer\r\nthat in the temple construction of the Tufa Period, the simple and\r\nelegant Ionic entablature was the prevailing type.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its free adaption of Greek forms, the Tufa Period\r\navailed itself very sparingly of polychrome decoration for\r\narchitectural members. The stucco of the Ionic capital in the house of\r\nthe Faun is white; white likewise are most of the capitals of\r\npilasters found in the houses, and also the numerous Ionic cornices on\r\nthe walls.\r\n\r\nThere are, nevertheless, scanty traces of the application of color. In\r\nthe wall decoration of the house of Sallust we find a Doric frieze\r\nwith the metopes painted red. The frieze under the Ionic cornices on\r\nthe walls also is usually made prominent with color,--red, yellow, or\r\nblue; and a red frieze is seen in the peristyle of the house of the\r\nBlack Wall, above the pilasters of the garden wall. The lower stripe\r\nof the painted architrave in the house of the Faun, already referred\r\nto, is yellow.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that in some cases color was applied to the\r\nprojecting figures of the peculiar capitals used in houses; at the\r\ntime of excavation, traces of coloring were distinctly seen upon those\r\nbelonging to the alae of the house of Epidius Rufus (p. 309). The\r\nexposed capitals at the entrances (Fig. 178), if originally painted,\r\nwould naturally have lost all traces of the coloring before the\r\ndestruction of the city, unless it were from time to time renewed.\r\nNotwithstanding these exceptions, we must conclude that the stucco\r\ncoating upon public buildings and temples was generally white, in the\r\ncase of capitals and cornices as well as of the shafts of columns and\r\noutside walls; colors were used to a limited extent, upon friezes and\r\nperhaps other parts of entablatures.\r\n\r\nThe architectural remains of the half century immediately succeeding\r\nthe Tufa Period, between the founding of the Roman colony at Pompeii\r\nand the establishment of the Empire, present nothing specially\r\ncharacteristic outside of the peculiarities of construction mentioned\r\nin Chap. 6.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier years of the Empire, the Pompeians, as Roman subjects\r\neverywhere, commenced to build temples and colonnades of marble. The\r\nstyle, which was distinctively Roman, can be studied to better\r\nadvantage elsewhere; the remains at Pompeii are relatively\r\nunimportant, and the chief points of interest have been mentioned in\r\nconnection with our study of individual buildings.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 252.--Capitals of columns, showing variations from\r\n   typical forms.\r\n\r\n     A. Ornate Doric, from the house of Sallust.\r\n     B. Modified Corinthian.\r\n     C. Fantastic Corinthian.]\r\n\r\nThe stylistic development of Roman architecture in the next\r\nperiod,--the gradual transition from the simplicity of the Augustan\r\nAge to the more elaborate ornamentation of the Flavian Era,--is marked\r\nby two opposing tendencies, one conservative, holding to the\r\ntraditions of marble construction, the other reactionary. The latter\r\ntendency manifests itself so strongly at Pompeii that it merits\r\nspecial comment.\r\n\r\nFirst in the East, it appears, men wearied of seeing the ornamental\r\nforms of the Greek religious architecture repeated over and over again\r\nin every kind of building, and attempted to break away from them\r\nentirely. The reaction reached Italy in the earlier years of the\r\nEmpire, and began to exert an influence upon ornamental forms,\r\nespecially of domestic architecture, at the time when the third style\r\nof wall decoration was coming into vogue.\r\n\r\nAt Pompeii, this revolt from tradition affected not only the\r\nornamentation of private houses, but also that of public buildings, as\r\nthe Stabian Baths, and even of temples, as those of Apollo and Isis,\r\nrebuilt after the earthquake of the year 63. Greek forms were\r\nreplaced by fantastic designs of every sort, worked in stucco. The\r\ncapitals of columns and pilasters retained a semblance of Doric and\r\nCorinthian types, but were adorned with motives from many sources; the\r\nvariety of form and treatment can best be appreciated by inspecting\r\nthe examples shown in our illustrations (Figs. 242, 253, 254).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 253.--Capital of pilaster, modified Corinthian\r\n   type.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 254.--Capitals of pilasters, showing free\r\n   adaptations of the Corinthian type.]\r\n\r\nThe entablatures no longer retained the ancient division of\r\narchitrave, frieze, and cornice, but were made to represent a single\r\nbroad stripe, sometimes, however, with a projecting cornice; this\r\nstripe was ornamented with stucco reliefs, and was frequently painted\r\nin bright colors. Sometimes the decorative theme is taken from a vine,\r\nas in the entablature of the portico in front of the temple of Isis\r\n(Fig. 80) and that of the peristyle of the house of the Vettii (Fig.\r\n161). In some cases the stripe is divided into vertical sections; the\r\nbroad sections correspond with the intercolumniations, the narrow ones\r\nwith the spaces above the columns; and the ornamental design is varied\r\naccordingly, as in the palaestra of the Stabian Baths (p. 198), the\r\ncourt of the temple of Apollo (Fig. 31), and the peristyle of the\r\nhouse of the Silver Wedding. In many instances the background is\r\nwhite, frequently part of the details of ornament as well; but colors\r\nwere freely used, particularly red, blue, and yellow, in all parts of\r\nthe entablature.\r\n\r\nThe lower third of the columns also was painted a bright red or\r\nyellow--a treatment that would have been abhorrent to the taste of\r\nthe Tufa Period. The desire for variety and brilliancy of color\r\nincreased, and was more pronounced in the years immediately preceding\r\nthe eruption than at any previous time.\r\n\r\nConsistently with this change in the standard of taste in regard to\r\ndetails, the Pompeians no longer had pleasure in the ample dimensions\r\nof the olden time. Houses were not now built with high rooms, great\r\ndoorways, and lofty columns as in the Tufa Period. The rooms were\r\nsmaller and lower, and also, we may add, more homelike. But curiously\r\nenough, the columns were often made thick as well as short, doubtless\r\nin order to afford more space for the display of color on the capitals\r\nand the lower part of the shaft.\r\n\r\nRoman public and religious architecture in most cities still adhered\r\nto the forms of marble construction, a suggestion of which we find in\r\nthe white walls of the temple of Isis; but the lower third of the\r\ncolumns in the colonnade about this temple was painted red, and the\r\nentablature was no doubt ornamented with colored designs, as was that\r\nof the temple of Apollo. The best preserved example of this last phase\r\nof Pompeian architectural ornamentation is in the semicircular vaulted\r\nniche at the right of the Street of Tombs.\r\n\r\nThus we see accomplished at Pompeii, in less than two centuries, a\r\ncomplete revolution in matters of taste, so far as relates to\r\narchitecture. An entirely new feeling has been developed. The beauty\r\nof contour and of symmetrical proportion found in the Greek\r\narchitecture had no charm for the Pompeian of the later time; its\r\nplace had been usurped by a different form of beauty, that produced by\r\nthe use of a variety of brilliant colors in association with forms\r\nthat were intricate, and often grotesque.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE XI.--ARTEMIS. COPY OF AN ARCHAIC WORK]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII\r\n\r\n_SCULPTURE_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe open squares and public buildings of Pompeii were peopled with\r\nstatues. The visitor who walked about the Forum in the years\r\nimmediately preceding the eruption, saw on all sides the forms of the\r\nmen of past generations who had rendered service to the city, as well\r\nas those of men of his own time.\r\n\r\nBesides the five colossal images of emperors and members of the\r\nimperial families, places were provided in the Forum for between\r\nseventy and eighty life size equestrian statues; and behind each of\r\nthese was room for a standing figure. Whether all the places were\r\noccupied cannot now be determined, but from the sepulchral inscription\r\nof Umbricius Scaurus (p. 418) it is clear that as late as the time of\r\nClaudius or Nero, there was yet room for another equestrian figure.\r\nStatues were placed also in the Forum Triangulare and occasionally at\r\nthe sides of the streets.\r\n\r\nIn the portico of the Macellum were twenty-five statues; the sanctuary\r\nof the City Lares contained eight, while the portico of the Eumachia\r\nbuilding furnished places for twenty-one. But only one of the hundreds\r\nof statues erected in honor of worthy citizens has been preserved,\r\nthat of Holconius Rufus, the rebuilder of the Large Theatre; the\r\nfigure was dressed in the uniform of a military tribune, and stood on\r\nAbbondanza Street near the Stabian Baths. With this should be classed\r\nthe portrait statues in the temple of Fortuna (p. 131), and those of\r\nOctavia (Fig. 38), Marcellus (Fig. 39), and Eumachia.\r\n\r\nThe statue of Eumachia is an interesting example of the ordinary\r\nportrait sculpture of the Early Empire (Fig. 255). The pose is by no\r\nmeans ungraceful, the treatment of the drapery is modest and\r\neffective. The tranquil and thoughtful face is somewhat idealized,\r\nand without offensive emphasis of details. The statue is not a\r\nmasterpiece; nevertheless, it gives us a pleasant impression of the\r\nlady whose generosity placed the fullers under obligation, and affords\r\nan insight into the artistic resources of the city.\r\n\r\nA number of portrait statues belonging to sepulchral monuments were\r\nfound when the tombs east of the Amphitheatre were excavated (Chap.\r\n51). Most of them are of tufa covered with stucco; the rest are of\r\nfine-grained limestone. From the aesthetic point of view they are\r\nvalueless.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 255.--Statue of the priestess Eumachia.]\r\n\r\nSculptured portraits of a different type were set up in private\r\nhouses. Relatives, freedmen, and even slaves sometimes placed at the\r\nrear of the atrium, near the entrance of the tablinum, a herm of the\r\nmaster of the house. At each side of the square pillar supporting the\r\nbust, there was usually an arm-like projection (seen on the herm of\r\nCornelius Rufus, Fig. 121), on which garlands were hung upon birthdays\r\nand other anniversary occasions. Both the herm of Rufus and that of\r\nVesonius Primus previously mentioned (p. 396) are of marble; the head\r\nbelonging to the herm of Sorex (p. 176) is of bronze.\r\n\r\nThe most striking of the portrait herms is that of Lucius Caecilius\r\nJucundus (Fig. 256), which was set up in duplicate, for the sake of\r\nsymmetrical arrangement, in the atrium of his house on Stabian Street.\r\nThe pillar is of marble; the dedication reads _Genio L[ucii] nostri\r\nFelix l[ibertus]_,--'Felix, freedman, to the Genius of our Lucius.'\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 256.--Portrait herm of Caecilius Jucundus.]\r\n\r\nThe bust, of bronze, is modelled with realistic vigor. There is no\r\nattempt to soften the prominent and almost repulsive features by\r\nidealization. We see the Pompeian auctioneer just as he was, a shrewd,\r\nalert, energetic man, with somewhat of a taste for art, and more for\r\nthe good things of life,--a man who would bear watching in a financial\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nHouses were adorned also with heads and busts of famous men of the\r\npast,--poets, philosophers, and statesmen. An extensive collection of\r\nhistorical portraits was discovered at Herculaneum, but Pompeii thus\r\nfar has not yielded many examples. In a room in one of the houses was\r\nfound a group of three marble heads, about one half life size,\r\nrepresenting Epicurus, Demosthenes, and apparently the Alexandrian\r\npoet Callimachus, whose works were particularly valued in the time of\r\nthe Early Empire. The identification of the third head is not certain,\r\nbut whether Callimachus or some other poet is intended, the group\r\nreveals the direction of the owner's literary tastes; he was\r\ninterested in philosophy, oratory, and poetry.\r\n\r\nTwo portrait busts of distinguished men, which evidently belong\r\ntogether, were found in another house, laid one side. In the Naples\r\nMuseum they bore the names of the Younger Brutus and Pompey, but both\r\nidentifications are erroneous; the features in neither case agree with\r\nthe representations upon coins. The faces, as shown by the physiognomy\r\nand the treatment of the hair, are those of Romans of the end of the\r\nRepublic or the beginning of the Empire. Recently a new identification\r\nhas been proposed which has much in its favor. It rests chiefly upon\r\nthe resemblance of one of the busts to the mosaic portrait of Virgil,\r\ndiscovered in 1896 at Susa, in Africa. The full, round face of the\r\nother agrees very well with what we know of the appearance of Horace.\r\nIt may be that we have here a pair of poets, the two most prominent of\r\nthe Augustan Age.\r\n\r\nFrequently the gardens of the peristyles, as those of the houses of\r\nthe Vettii and of Lucretius, were profusely adorned with sculptures of\r\nall kinds. We find in them statuettes, herms, small figures of\r\nanimals, and diminutive groups. Figures derived from the myths of the\r\nbacchic cycle, Bacchus, Silenus, satyrs, and bacchantes, are\r\nparticularly common. The artistic value is slight; among the best\r\nexamples is the double bust, with Bacchus on one side and a bacchante\r\non the other, found in the garden of the house of the Vettii (Fig.\r\n257).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 257.--Double bust, Bacchus and bacchante. Garden\r\n   of the house of the Vettii.]\r\n\r\nCharacteristic among these sculptures are the figures designed for the\r\nadornment of fountains; a number of them are exhibited in the Museum\r\nat Naples. Bacchic figures are met with most frequently. A good\r\nexample is the marble Silenus in the garden of the house of\r\nLucretius; the water spurts from the opening in the wineskin which the\r\nold man carries. The design of the small bronze satyr in the peristyle\r\nof the house of the Centenary is more pleasing; an opening in the\r\nwineskin, held under the left arm, cast a jet against the outstretched\r\nright hand in such a way that the water was thrown back upon the\r\nsatyr's body.\r\n\r\nFountains were adorned also with genre groups and animal forms. We\r\nhave already noticed the two bronze groups in the peristyle of the\r\nhouse of the Vettii, each representing a boy holding a duck, from the\r\nbill of which sprang a jet of water (Fig. 162). The largest collection\r\nof animal forms was about the basin in the middle peristyle of the\r\nhouse of the Citharist; it comprised two dogs, a boar, a lion, a deer,\r\nand a snake, each throwing a jet into the basin below. The fountain\r\njets, however, were not in all cases so closely related to the\r\nornamental pieces. A number of those in the house of the Vettii sprang\r\nfrom lead pipes near the figures. The familiar bronze statue of the\r\nseated fisherman, in the Naples Museum, belonged to a fountain, in\r\nwhich the jet was thrown forward, not from the figure, but from the\r\nmouth of a mask projecting from the stump on which the fisherman sits.\r\n\r\nOf the statues of divinities set up for worship in the temples, there\r\nare unfortunately but few remains. The most important fragment is the\r\nhead of Jupiter, discussed in a previous chapter (Fig. 22). Three\r\nwretched terra cotta statues of the gods of the Capitol were found, as\r\nwe have seen, in the temple of Zeus Milichius; and mention has been\r\nmade also of the herms and other specimens of sculpture in the courts\r\nof the temples of Apollo and Isis, and in the palaestra. More numerous\r\nthan any other class of sculptures, however, are the small bronze\r\nimages of tutelary divinities preserved in the domestic shrines. These\r\nare of interest rather from the light which they shed on the practices\r\nof domestic worship than from their excellence as works of art, and it\r\nseems unnecessary to add anything here to what has already been said\r\nin regard to them in the chapter dealing with the arrangements of the\r\nPompeian house. But occasionally there were large domestic shrines, in\r\nwhich statues of merit were placed; among these are two worthy of\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nIn the corner of a garden belonging to a house in the first Region (I.\r\nii. 17) is a shrine faced with white marble, in which was a small\r\nmarble statue of Aphrodite, partly supported by a figure commonly\r\nidentified as Hope, _Spes_. The carving is in no way remarkable, but\r\nthe statue is of interest on account of the well preserved coloring\r\napplied to the eyes, hair, and dress. The group is now in the Naples\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nA more important example, from the aesthetic point of view, is the\r\nstatue of Artemis, of one half life size, shown in Plate XI. It was\r\nfound in a house near the Amphitheatre which was excavated in 1760 and\r\ncovered up again. It is a careful copy, made in the time of Augustus,\r\nof a Greek masterpiece produced in the period of the Persian Wars. The\r\noriginal was probably the Artemis Laphria mentioned by Pausanias. This\r\nwas a work of Menaechmus and Soedas, two sculptors of Naupactus.\r\nPrevious to the battle of Actium it stood in a sanctuary in Calydon,\r\nwhence it was removed by Augustus, who presented it to the colony\r\nfounded by him at Patras.\r\n\r\nThe goddess appears in this statue as a huntress, moving forward with\r\na firm but light step; the bow in the left hand has disappeared. The\r\ncopyist was remarkably successful in impressing upon his work the\r\ngracious and pleasing character of the original; the later archaic\r\nGreek art, in spite of its conventions, is full of human feeling. The\r\ncopy preserved also the coloring of the model; but the tinting of the\r\nRoman colorist was probably less delicate than that of the Greek\r\nlimner who added the polychrome decoration to the marble original. The\r\nhair was yellow. The pupils of the eyes were brown, the eyelashes and\r\neyebrows black. The rosettes of the diadem were yellow, and the border\r\nof the outer garment was richly variegated in tints of yellow, rose\r\ncolor, and white. Traces of rose-colored stripes are visible also\r\nabout the openings of the sleeves, on the edge of the mantle at the\r\nneck, and on the border of the chiton.\r\n\r\nBesides the bronze statues of Apollo and Artemis already mentioned\r\n(pp. 88, 352), four others of those found at Pompeii are worthy of\r\nmore than passing notice,--the dancing satyr from which the house of\r\nthe Faun received its name, the small Silenus used as a standard for\r\na vase, the so-called Narcissus and the Ephebus found in 1900.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 258.--Dancing Faun. Bronze statuette, now in the\r\n   Naples Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe dancing satyr is shown in Fig. 258. It was found lying on the\r\nfloor of the atrium in the house of the Faun, but the pedestal could\r\nnot be identified. The figure is instinct with rhythmic motion. Every\r\nmuscle of the satyr's sinewy frame is in tension as he moves forward\r\nin the dance, snapping his fingers to keep time; the pose is a marvel\r\nof skill. The unhuman character of the half-brute is indicated by the\r\nhorns projecting from the forehead, and the pointed ears. The face,\r\nmarked by low cunning, offers no suggestion of lofty thought or moral\r\nsense. We have here the personification of unalloyed physical\r\nenjoyment. The satyr, unvexed by any care or qualm of conscience, is\r\nintoxicated with the joy of free movement, and dances on and on,\r\nunwearied, with perfect ease and grace.\r\n\r\nMuscular tension is skilfully indicated in the Silenus, who stands\r\nholding above his head with his left hand a round frame, in which, as\r\nshown by the fragments, a vase of colored glass was standing at the\r\ntime of the eruption. The head, crowned with ivy, leans forward and to\r\nthe right, and the right hand is moved away from the body in the\r\neffort to balance the weight supported by the left. The frame is\r\nawkwardly designed to represent a snake. The thick-set figure of\r\nSilenus is about sixteen inches high. This bronze was discovered in\r\n1864, in the house of Popidius Priscus (VII. ii. 20).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 259.--Listening Dionysus, wrongly identified as\r\n   Narcissus. Bronze statuette in the Naples Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe third of the bronzes mentioned is also a statuette, about two feet\r\nhigh (Fig. 259). It was found in 1863 in a house of the seventh Region\r\n(VII. xii. 21). The figure is that of a youth of remarkable beauty.\r\nThe face wears an expression of childlike innocence and pleasure. The\r\nhead leans forward in the attitude of listening; the index finger of\r\nthe right hand is extended, and the graceful pose is that of one who\r\ncatches the almost inaudible sound of a distant voice.\r\n\r\nThe name Narcissus, given to the figure by Fiorelli immediately upon\r\nits discovery, is surely wrong; that unhappy youth did not reciprocate\r\nthe love of the nymph Echo, and could not have been imagined with so\r\ncheerful a face. The figure has also been called Pan, from a myth in\r\nwhich Pan and Echo appear together; but the characteristic attributes\r\nare lacking, and the rough god of the shepherds would not have been\r\nrepresented in so lithe and graceful a form.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful youth, with an ivy crown upon his head and elaborate\r\ncoverings for the feet, and with the skin of a doe hanging over his\r\nshoulder, is none other than Dionysus himself. The mirthful god of the\r\nvine is not playing with his panther--the base is too small to have\r\nbeen designed for two figures, and the attitude of listening is not\r\nconsistent with this interpretation. The youthful divinity has fixed\r\nhis attention upon some distant sound,--the cries of the bacchantes\r\nupon some mountain height, or the laughter of naiads in a shady glen.\r\n\r\nOf unusual interest is the bronze statue of an ephebus, discovered in\r\nNovember, 1900, outside the city on the north side, about a hundred\r\npaces from the Vesuvius Gate; it was laid away in an upper room of a\r\nhouse presenting nothing else worthy of note. It is apparently a Greek\r\noriginal, and is of three-quarters life size (Fig. 260).\r\n\r\nThe statue represents a youth about fourteen years of age, of slender\r\nbut well-developed form, and finely chiselled features. Advancing with\r\nfirm but graceful step, he rests the right foot, and is bringing the\r\nleft foot forward. In his right hand, extended, he carried some\r\nobject--a branch, it may be, or a crown, which was to be laid upon an\r\naltar; the eye naturally follows the movement of the hand.\r\n\r\nEspecially effective is the rhythmic movement of the body. The right\r\nthigh, sustained by the resting foot, is carried slightly forward; the\r\nchest on the left side swings back, while in consequence of the\r\nextension of the right hand the shoulders remain horizontal.\r\nNotwithstanding the felicity of the pose, it must be confessed that\r\nthe modelling as a whole is somewhat lacking in vigor, the treatment\r\nof details being superficial.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 260.--Bronze youth. Naples Museum.]\r\n\r\nIn Greece, before it was carried off to Italy, the figure may have\r\nbeen set up as a votive offering in some sanctuary, or have stood in a\r\ngymnasium. From indications on the under side of the feet it is clear\r\nthat the statue, after the manner in vogue in Greece, was mounted on a\r\nstone pedestal, being joined to the pedestal with melted lead; the\r\nround bronze base found with it is of Italian origin. Probably when it\r\nwas being transported from Greece the eyes, of marble, became loose in\r\ntheir sockets and fell down into the hollow interior of the statue;\r\nthey were replaced by glass eyes. The breaking of the right arm, which\r\nwas severed when found, made possible the recovery of the original\r\neyes, which have now again been set in place.\r\n\r\nInsensible to the charm of the figure when seen as the sculptor\r\ndesigned it, the Pompeian owner, deciding to turn it to practical use,\r\nconverted it into a lampholder. In the right hand was placed a short\r\nbar of bronze, to either end of which was fastened a small ornament\r\nwith a projecting arm, for a hanging lamp; the whole statue was then\r\ncoated with silver. However barbarous the taste that prompted the\r\ntransformation, the decorative effect of the silvered statue with its\r\nlighted lamps must have been far from unpleasant.\r\n\r\nRegarding the place of the statue in relation to the development of\r\nGreek sculpture, it is yet too early to speak.\r\n\r\nHad the ruins of Pompeii not been systematically searched, after the\r\ndisaster, for works of art and other objects of value, they would have\r\nyielded a far richer store of sculptures. But while the specimens\r\nrecovered add little to our knowledge of types, they give a new\r\ninsight into the application of the sculptor's art in antiquity to the\r\nbeautifying of the surroundings of everyday life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV\r\n\r\n_PAINTING.--WALL DECORATION_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inner walls of houses and public buildings at Pompeii were\r\nplastered, and usually decorated with colors; only storerooms,\r\nkitchens, and apartments designed for the use of slaves were left in\r\nthe white. Outer walls were as a rule plastered, except when built of\r\nhewn stone, a kind of construction not employed after the Tufa Period.\r\nStucco was occasionally used on facades of ashlar work where special\r\nornamentation seemed to be needed, as at the entrance of the house of\r\nthe Faun; and in later times, now and then, a front with reticulate or\r\nbrick facing was left unplastered. Previous to the time of Augustus\r\nthe stucco coating of outer walls ordinarily remained uncolored.\r\nAfterwards color was employed, but only to a limited extent, as in the\r\naddition of a dark base to a wall the rest of which remained white.\r\n\r\nThe painting upon Pompeian walls, as shown by the painstaking\r\ninvestigations of Otto Donner, was fresco, that is, executed in water\r\ncolors upon the moist stucco of a freshly plastered surface. The\r\nmethod of preparing the wall was less elaborate than that recommended\r\nby Vitruvius, who advises the use of seven coats of plaster, first a\r\nrough coat, then three of sand mortar and three of stucco made with\r\npowdered marble, each coat being finer than the one preceding. In the\r\nbetter rooms, however, we find upon the walls at least one, often\r\nseveral, layers of sand mortar, and one or more coats of marble\r\nstucco; the entire thickness of the plastering varies from two to\r\nthree inches. In unfinished or neglected rooms walls are sometimes\r\nfound with a single coat of sand mortar. Occasionally powdered brick\r\nwas used in the stucco as a substitute for marble dust.\r\n\r\nPlastering so thick as that ordinarily used must have remained moist\r\nfor a considerable length of time, much longer than the plastering of\r\nour day; yet it could not have retained its moisture long enough to\r\ncomplete the painting of an entire wall as one piece. Walls which are\r\nelaborately decorated sometimes show traces of a seam, where a moist\r\nsection was laid on next to one that had already become partially dry.\r\nWhen the decorative design included pictures, usually the divisions\r\nand borders and other decorative elements were finished rapidly while\r\nthe surface was moist; then a square or round hole was cut where a\r\npicture was to be inserted, and filled with fresh stucco, on which the\r\npicture was painted. In this way a carefully executed painting could\r\nbe set in a wall already dry.\r\n\r\nIn the last years of the city pictures were sometimes painted on the\r\ndry surface of a wall that had previously received its decorative\r\nframework; some of the figures seen in the middle of the large panels\r\nfurnish examples of this method of work. A size of some kind must have\r\nbeen used in such cases, but chemical analysis thus far has failed to\r\ndetermine its nature. The distemper painting was much less durable\r\nthan the fresco, the colors of which became fixed with the hardening\r\nof the wall.\r\n\r\nSometimes, as in the house of Lucretius, the place of paintings upon\r\nstucco was taken by paintings upon wood, the wooden panels being let\r\ninto the wall. As these panels were thin and lacked durability, we may\r\nperhaps believe that the paintings which they contained were of\r\ninferior quality.\r\n\r\nThe artistic value of Pompeian painting varies from the routine work\r\nof indifferent decorators to pictures of genuine merit, such as those\r\nfound in the house of the Tragic Poet, the house of the Vettii, and\r\nthe house of Castor and Pollux. Viewed as a whole, the wall decoration\r\nhas a peculiar interest for us; it not only richly illustrates the\r\napplication of painting by the ancients to decorative uses, but also\r\naffords a striking example of the evolution of decorative designs from\r\nsimple architectural motives to intricate patterns, in which the\r\nscheme of coloring is hardly less complicated than that of the\r\nornamental forms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe four styles of wall decoration were briefly characterized in the\r\nIntroduction, in connection with our survey of the periods of\r\nconstruction. It now remains to illustrate these by typical examples\r\nand to trace their inner connection. We are here concerned only with\r\nthe decorative designs, or ornamental framework of the walls; the\r\npaintings, which formed the centre of interest in the later styles,\r\nare reserved for consideration in a separate chapter.\r\n\r\nThe development of ancient wall decoration came comparatively late,\r\nafter the art of painting, in the hands of the Greek masters, had\r\nreached and passed its climax. Yet we know almost nothing in regard to\r\nthe earlier stages. Apparently the system which we find at Pompeii\r\noriginated in the period following the death of Alexander the Great,\r\nand received its impulse of development from the contact of Greece\r\nwith the Orient. But whatever the origin, from the time to which the\r\nearliest specimens at Pompeii belong--the second century B.C.--to the\r\ndestruction of the city, we can trace an uninterrupted development,\r\nwhich, nevertheless, comes to an end in the latter part of the first\r\ncentury A.D.\r\n\r\nThe decline is characterized by increasing poverty of design, with\r\nfeeble imitation of past styles. Just as it is setting in, however,\r\nextant examples become rare. Some specimens of the wall decoration of\r\nlater times, as of the period of the Antonines and the reign of\r\nSeptimius Severus, are preserved, but they are isolated and not\r\nsufficient in number to enable us to follow the stages of the decline.\r\nThus it happens that the only period in the history of ancient wall\r\ndecoration in regard to which we have the materials for a full and\r\nsatisfactory study, is the period exemplified in the remains at\r\nPompeii, the chronological sequence of which extends over two\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nThe oldest houses, those belonging to the Period of the Limestone\r\nAtriums (p. 39), have preserved no traces of wall decoration beyond\r\nthe limited application of white stucco.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the decoration of the Tufa Period are fairly abundant,\r\nand are well preserved on account of the excellent quality of the\r\nstucco to which the colors were applied. They belong to the first or\r\nIncrustation Style. A good example has already been given, the end\r\nwall of a bedroom in the house of the Centaur (Fig. 122); we present\r\nhere, for more detailed examination, the left wall of the atrium in\r\nthe house of Sallust (Fig. 261).\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the lack of color in our illustration, the divisions\r\nof the wall are plainly seen--a dado, painted yellow; a relatively low\r\nmiddle division, the upper edge of which is set off by a projecting\r\ncornice; and an upper part reaching from the first cornice, which\r\nappears in three sections on account of the doors, to the second. The\r\nsurface of the main part of the wall is moulded in stucco to represent\r\nslabs or blocks with bevelled edges, which are painted in imitation of\r\ndifferent kinds of marble. Above the high double doors opening into\r\nrooms connected with the atrium, frames of lattice-work for the\r\nadmission of air and light have been assumed in our restoration.\r\n\r\nThe dado in the Incrustation Style is generally treated as a separate\r\nmember; in rare instances the imitation of marble blocks is extended\r\nto the floor. It has a smooth surface and is painted a bright color,\r\nusually yellow; there is no suggestion of the practice of later times,\r\nwhich gave a darker color to the base than to the rest of the wall.\r\nThis independent handling is undoubtedly to be explained as a survival\r\nfrom a previous decorative system, in which the lower part of the\r\nwall, as at Tiryns, was protected by a baseboard; the conventional\r\nyellow color with which it is painted, as in the case of the lower\r\nstripe of the Doric architrave in the house of the Faun (p. 51), is a\r\nreminiscence of the use of wood. The upper edge of the dado was\r\nordinarily distinguished by a smooth, narrow projecting band or\r\nfillet.\r\n\r\nThe blocks moulded in slight relief upon the main part of the wall are\r\nof different sizes. In our illustration we see first a series of three\r\nlarge slabs, which are painted black. Above these are three narrow\r\nblocks of magenta. The rest present a considerable variety of size and\r\ncolor, until we reach those just under the cornice, which again are\r\nall of the same shade, magenta.\r\n\r\nThe cornice in this style is always of the Ionic type, with dentils.\r\nIn many cases, as that of the bedroom in the house of the Centaur, it\r\nserves as an upper border for the decoration, the wall above being\r\nunpainted. Sometimes, however, the imitation of marble is carried\r\nabove the cornice, the wall surface being divided to represent\r\nsmoothly joined blocks without bevelled edges, or painted in plain\r\nmasses of color separated by a narrow white stripe, as in the atrium\r\nof the house of Sallust. Above these brilliant panels we see in Fig.\r\n261 a second cornice of simple design; the wall between this cornice\r\nand the ceiling was left without decoration.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 261.--Wall decoration in the atrium of the house\r\n   of Sallust. First or Incrustation Style.]\r\n\r\nThis system made no provision for paintings; their place was taken in\r\nthe general scheme of decoration by elaborate mosaic pictures upon the\r\nfloor. The taste of the age evidently preferred representations in\r\nmosaic; otherwise the painting of pictures upon the walls, which was\r\nbrought to so high a degree of perfection by Polygnotus and his\r\ncontemporaries, would not have been abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe Incrustation Style, as exemplified at Pompeii, is in a secondary\r\nstage; it must have been worked out originally in genuine materials,\r\nat a time when walls were actually veneered, to a certain height, with\r\nslabs of various kinds of marble, cut and arranged to represent ashlar\r\nwork; above the cornice marking the upper edge of the veneering, the\r\nsurface was left in the white. The use of different varieties of\r\nmarble points to an active commercial intercourse between the\r\ncountries about the Mediterranean Sea, such as first became possible\r\nafter the conquests of Alexander. So characteristic a style, requiring\r\nthe use of costly materials, could only have been developed in an\r\nimportant centre of wealth and culture.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 262.--Distribution of colors in the section of\r\n   wall represented in Fig. 261.]\r\n\r\nIn view of all the circumstances, we are probably safe in concluding\r\nthat the Incrustation Style originated in Alexandria, in the third\r\ncentury B.C. From Alexandria it spread to other cities of the East and\r\nWest, stucco being used in imitation of marble, where marble could not\r\nbe procured; scanty remains similar to those at Pompeii, and of\r\napproximately the same period--the second century B.C.--have been\r\nfound at Pergamon, on the island of Delos, and lately in Priene. This\r\nstyle represents for us the wall decoration of the Hellenistic age. It\r\nis characterized by the same poverty of form and obvious striving\r\nafter simplicity which we have noticed in the architecture of the Tufa\r\nPeriod. The projecting cornice above the body of the wall is always of\r\nthe same type; yet the second century B.C. enjoyed a rich heritage of\r\narchitectural forms, and lack of variety in this and other details of\r\nornamentation was due, not to dearth of materials, but to the\r\nprevailing taste.\r\n\r\nThe earliest known example of the decoration of the second or\r\nArchitectural Style, is on the walls of the Small Theatre, which was\r\nbuilt soon after 80 B.C. The style remained in vogue till the middle\r\nof the reign of Augustus; it may be loosely characterized as the wall\r\ndecoration of the first century B.C. It shows an interesting\r\ndevelopment from simpler to richer and more complex forms. The more\r\nelaborate and finished designs are not so well exemplified at Pompeii\r\nas in Rome, where two beautiful series have been found, both dating\r\nfrom the earlier part of the reign of Augustus. One series is in the\r\nso-called house of Livia or Germanicus on the Palatine. The other was\r\nfound in a house on the right bank of the Tiber, excavated in 1878;\r\nthe paintings were removed to the new Museo delle Terme. The specimen\r\nshown in Plate XII, however, is from a Pompeian wall; the room in\r\nwhich it was found opens off from the peristyle of a house in the\r\nfifth Region (V. i. 18).\r\n\r\nThe oldest walls of the second style closely resemble those of the\r\nfirst, with this characteristic difference: the imitation of marble\r\nveneering is no longer produced with the aid of relief; color alone is\r\nemployed, upon a plane surface, as in the cella of the temple of\r\nJupiter (Fig. 20). The earlier division of the wall into three parts\r\nis retained, but the painted cornice, no longer restricted to the\r\ndentil type, appears in a variety of forms. The base also is treated\r\nwith greater freedom. Frequently it is painted in strong projection,\r\nas if the rest of the wall above it were further from the eye, while\r\nupon the shelf thus formed are painted columns reaching to the ceiling\r\nand seemingly in front of the main part of the wall; such columns and\r\npillars, with Corinthian capitals, are seen in Plate XII, at the right\r\nand the left.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE XII.--SPECIMEN OF WALL DECORATION. SECOND OR\r\n   ARCHITECTURAL STYLE.]\r\n\r\nThus the designs of this style at first comprised only simple\r\nelements, a wall made up of painted blocks or panels with a dado\r\npainted in projection supporting columns that seemed to carry an\r\narchitrave on which the ceiling rested; there is an excellent example\r\nin the house of the Labyrinth, on the walls of a room at the rear of\r\nthe garden. But the designs gradually became more complex, partly\r\nthrough the differentiation of the simple elements, partly through the\r\nintroduction of new motives, until a complete architectural system\r\nwas developed. This system differs from that of the fourth style,\r\nwhich is also architectural, in that it adheres in the main to actual\r\nor possible structural forms, while those of the fourth style are\r\nfantastic in their proportions and arrangement.\r\n\r\nIn this process of development two clearly defined tendencies become\r\nmanifest, one affecting the treatment of the upper division of the\r\nwall, the other the elaboration of a characteristic motive which now\r\nfirst appears, a framework for the principal painting; for\r\narchitectural designs are well adapted for the display of pictures,\r\nand wall paintings now begin to have a prominent place in Pompeian\r\ndecoration.\r\n\r\nThe upper division tends more and more to be represented as an open\r\nspace, behind the plane of projection in which the main part appears.\r\nThus in Plate XII we see on either side a silver vase with fruits and\r\nvine leaves, standing on the cornice of the main wall, in the open.\r\nOften the upper space is painted blue, as if one caught a glimpse of\r\nthe sky above the wall; sometimes the outline of a wall further beyond\r\nis seen, or columns in the rear connected with those in front by a\r\ndecorative framework; and not infrequently small architectural\r\ndesigns, in perspective, rest upon the cornice where the vases are\r\nshown in our plate. But in all the designs of this style, complex as\r\nwell as simple, the threefold division of the wall carried over from\r\nthe first style is retained; very often the distinction between the\r\nbase, main wall, and upper portion is emphasized by painting them so\r\nthat they seem to be in three planes of projection.\r\n\r\nThe ornamental framework for the painting, consistently with the\r\narchitectural character of the decoration as a whole, is generally\r\nconceived as a pavilion projecting from the wall; so in Plate XII,\r\nwhere we see two columns sustaining a roof, upon the front of which\r\nwinged figures stand, each with a hand extended upward to the\r\nentablature of the large pillars at the sides. The design of the\r\npavilion is suggested by that of a shrine, such a shrine as the one in\r\nthe apse of the sanctuary of the City Lares (Fig. 41).\r\n\r\nThis conception is here borne out by the subject of the painting,\r\nwhich represents a statue of Dionysus resting, ivy-crowned, with a\r\nthyrsus in his left hand; the right hand is thrown gracefully over the\r\nhead, and at the feet of the god the lifelike figure of a panther is\r\nseen. The round high pedestal supporting the group is in the open, and\r\nthe background affords a charming vista among the trees.\r\n\r\nThis framing of the principal painting led further to the division of\r\nthe body of the wall vertically into three sections, a broad central\r\nsection, included within the outline of the pavilion, and two panels,\r\none at each side. The arrangement is well illustrated in our plate,\r\nthe side panels of which are adorned with painted statues of\r\ntastefully draped figures, one of them holding a lyre. The later\r\nstyles of decoration retained this symmetrical division of the wall\r\nspace, which made prominent the picture of greatest interest without\r\ndetracting from the finish of the decorative setting; but in the\r\nfourth style it is often obscured by the intricacy of the designs.\r\n\r\nThe third style came into vogue during the reign of Augustus, and was\r\nprevalent until about 50 A.D.; we shall call it the Ornate Style, from\r\nits free use of ornament. It was developed out of the second style in\r\nthe same way that the second style was developed out of the first; but\r\nthe transition was not accomplished at Pompeii, which, like the\r\nprovincial cities of our day, received its fashions from the great\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the Ornate Style, as regards both the main\r\ndesign and the ornamentation, may easily be perceived from the example\r\npresented in Fig. 263, especially if this is viewed in contrast with\r\nthe specimen of the preceding style shown in Plate XII. The\r\narchitectural design has now lost all semblance of real construction.\r\nColumns, entablatures, and other members are treated conventionally,\r\nas subordinate parts of a decorative scheme; they are, with few\r\nexceptions, reduced to narrow bands or stripes of color dividing the\r\nsurface of the wall. The elaborate border of the central painting\r\nsuggests a pavilion, yet the projecting base, which in the second\r\nstyle gave this design its significance, is lacking. Hardly less\r\nnoteworthy is the treatment of the upper portion of the wall. Fanciful\r\narchitectural forms and various ornaments stand out against a white\r\nbackground, suggestive of the open sky; yet in our example, as often\r\nin this style, there is no organic connection between the decoration\r\nof the main part of the wall and that of the ceiling.\r\n\r\nEvery part of the framework of the third style is profusely\r\nornamented. The ornamental system is seen to have a certain affinity\r\nwith that of Egypt, and Egyptian figures occasionally appear; whence\r\nwe infer that it was developed in Alexandria. Early in the reign of\r\nAugustus, in consequence of the relations with Egypt following the\r\nbattle of Actium, a new impulse may well have been given to the\r\nintroduction into Italy of Alexandrian art.\r\n\r\nThe specimen of the third style shown in Fig. 263 is from the\r\nbeautiful decoration of the house of Spurius Mesor, portions of which\r\nare well preserved. The base of our specimen consists of two parts, a\r\nlower border and a broad stripe of black divided into sections of\r\ndifferent shapes and sizes by lines of light color. In the small\r\nsections ornaments are seen painted in delicate shades, two of them\r\nbeing faces.\r\n\r\nThe large painting presents a mythological scene, but the subject is\r\nnot clear. The priestess seems to be performing a ceremony of\r\nexpiation in order to free from the taint of some crime the young man\r\nwho, with a wreath on his head and a sword, pointed downward, in his\r\nright hand, bends over the hind just slain as a sacrifice. The colors\r\nare subdued and effective; the painting from the technical point of\r\nview is among the best found at Pompeii.\r\n\r\nAround the painting are narrow black stripes separated by white lines;\r\nin the broader stripe underneath, between the columns, are two light\r\nblue birds upon a dull red ground. The small squares in the flat\r\ncornice above are of many colors, shades of green, pink, and brown\r\npredominating. The broad panels on either side of the painting are of\r\nthe color often called Pompeian red; they have an ornamented border,\r\nand a small winged figure in the centre. The stripe below these shows\r\nvases and other ornaments on an orange-yellow ground; that above,\r\ninterrupted by the cornice over the painting, is black, with various\r\nornaments, as baskets of fruit, sistrums, and geese, painted in\r\nneutral colors. Among the ornaments of the upper part of the wall,\r\nfestoons of leaves, vines, vases, parrots, and griffins can be\r\ndistinguished, painted in light shades of brown, blue, green, and\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 263.--Specimen of wall decoration. Third or Ornate\r\n   Style. From the house of Spurius Mesor.]\r\n\r\nThe effect of the Ornate Style, with its symmetrical forms and variety\r\nof detail, is pleasing; but the free use of neutral tones gives the\r\nwalls a somewhat cold and formal appearance when we bring into\r\ncontrast the warm coloring of the next period.\r\n\r\nThe fourth or Intricate Style first appears about the middle of the\r\nfirst century A.D. It started, as did the third, with the symmetrical\r\ndivision of the wall developed in the second style; it differs from\r\nthe third in that it always retained a sense of architectural form.\r\nThe columns are often fluted, as in a specimen in the Naples Museum\r\n(Fig. 264). The entablatures and coffered ceilings, light and airy as\r\nthey often seem, have nevertheless a suggestion of reality; we know\r\nthat architectural forms are presented, and not mere stripes of color.\r\nYet the difference between the fourth and the second style is no less\r\napparent. In the latter the architectural designs are not inconsistent\r\nwith real construction; in the former the imagination of the designer\r\nhad free scope, producing patterns so fantastic and intricate that the\r\nfundamental idea at the basis of the wall divisions seems entirely\r\nlost sight of at times.\r\n\r\nThe preference for architectural forms was carried so far that between\r\nthe large panels of black, red, or yellow, vertical sections of wall\r\nwere left which were filled with airy structures on a white\r\nbackground; the parts represented as nearest the beholder were painted\r\nyellow, those further back were adorned with all the colors of the\r\nrainbow, thus forming a kind of color perspective (Fig. 265). The\r\ndesigns of the main part were extended into the upper division, and\r\nfrequently the whole wall appears as an intricate scaffolding,\r\npartially concealed by the large panels; these sometimes have the\r\nappearance of tapestries hanging suspended from the scaffolding, and\r\nare so treated, as in the case of the curtains shown in Plate XIII.\r\nThe fundamental conception of the decorative system is lost when the\r\nbackground of the upper part and of the airy scaffoldings is no longer\r\nleft white, but painted the same color as the rest of the wall, so\r\nthat the effect of distance and perspective is obscured. Occasionally,\r\nalso, the architectural framework of the upper portion of the wall has\r\nno connection with that of the main part.\r\n\r\nThe ornaments of the fourth style were taken largely from the domain\r\nof plastic art. Groups of statuary as well as single figures appear\r\neither upon projecting portions of the architectural framework, as in\r\nFig. 264, or in the background. They are frequently painted yellow,\r\nsuggesting the gilding applied to ancient statues, particularly those\r\nof bronze, and present a striking contrast to the masses of strong\r\ncolor in the large panels and the brilliant shades of the\r\narchitectural designs. They are in harmony with the taste of the\r\nperiod, which, as we have seen, manifested a fondness for\r\nornamentation in stucco relief, the effect of which was heightened by\r\nthe free use of color.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 264.--Specimen of wall decoration. Fourth style.]\r\n\r\nThe large panels contained paintings of various sizes, sometimes\r\ncopies of masterpieces, more often a simple floating figure or a\r\nCupid; groups are also found, as Cupid and Pysche, or a satyr with a\r\nbacchante. The appearance of a picture worked in tapestry is given by\r\na border just inside the framework of the panel, as often in the\r\ndecoration of the fourth style.\r\n\r\nThe fourth style cannot have been derived from the third. It is\r\norganically related with the second, out of which it was developed by\r\nlaying stress on precisely that element, the architectural, the\r\nsuppression of which gave rise to the third style of decoration. The\r\nmost reasonable explanation of the relations of the four styles,\r\nbriefly stated, is this:--\r\n\r\nThe Incrustation Style, a direct offshoot of Hellenistic art, was\r\nprevalent in eastern cities, where it was naturally followed by the\r\nArchitectural Style; this may have been developed at one centre or, in\r\ndifferent phases, at different centres contemporaneously.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 265.--Specimen of wall decoration. Fourth style.\r\n\r\n   In the middle panel, mythological scene in which Hercules is the\r\n   principal figure; in each of the panels, a satyr and a bacchante.]\r\n\r\nAt some prominent centre, probably Alexandria, the Architectural Style\r\npassed over into the Ornate Style, which was introduced into Italy in\r\nthe reign of Augustus and remained in vogue till the middle of the\r\nfirst century A.D.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at some other centre of culture, possibly Antioch, the\r\nArchitectural Style, by an equally natural course of development, had\r\npassed over into the Intricate Style, which was first brought to\r\nPompeii about 50 A.D. and remained in fashion till the destruction of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nThe earthquake of the year 63 threw down some buildings and made\r\nnecessary the thorough-going repair of many others. Between that year\r\nand 79, more walls were freshly decorated, probably, than in any\r\nprevious period of equal length in the history of the city. For this\r\nreason, examples of decoration in the Intricate Style are much more\r\nnumerous than might have been expected from the length of time that it\r\nwas in vogue; they give the prevailing cast to the remains of painting\r\nin the ruins, and this style is ordinarily thought of when Pompeian\r\nwall decoration is referred to. The complex designs and brilliant\r\ncolors form a decorative scheme which is often most effective,\r\nalthough the system of the third style reveals a finer and more\r\ncorrect taste.\r\n\r\nIf no remains of the two earlier styles had survived to modern times,\r\nthe antecedents and relations of the other two could not possibly be\r\nunderstood. But with the first two in mind, we are able to see clearly\r\nhow the most complex forms of the later decoration may be reduced, in\r\nlast analysis, to simple elements. Even in the example of the\r\nIntricate Style given in Plate XIII, we find a suggestion of the\r\nthreefold division of the wall into base, main part, and upper part,\r\nwhich was so prominent in the Incrustation Style; and also an\r\nelaborate structural form at the middle of the wall recalling the\r\npavilion framework of the second style, with a symmetrical arrangement\r\nof the architectural designs on either side, suggesting the panels at\r\nthe sides of the principal painting.\r\n\r\nThe slabs of colored marble in the Incrustation Style are represented\r\nby panels for pictures or ornamental forms of all shapes and sizes;\r\nand the architectural designs, so simple at the beginning, have by\r\nalmost imperceptible changes and additions become decorative patterns\r\nso varied and intricate that taken by themselves they give no hint of\r\ntheir origin.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE XIII.--SPECIMEN OF WALL DECORATION. FOURTH OR\r\n   INTRICATE STYLE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV\r\n\r\n_THE PAINTINGS_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hanging of pictures upon the walls seems not to have been in vogue\r\nat Pompeii during the period to which the remains belong. The system\r\nof decoration left no room for framed paintings, and no traces of any\r\nsuch have been discovered. The paintings which have been preserved at\r\nPompeii, not merely the small groups and single figures introduced to\r\nenliven the design, but the large compositions as well, all formed a\r\npart of the wall decoration.\r\n\r\nThe number is relatively large. In the catalogue by Helbig, published\r\nin 1868, there are nearly two thousand entries, including a few\r\npaintings from Herculaneum and other Campanian sites. The supplement\r\ncompiled by Sogliano in 1879 records more than eight hundred pictures\r\nbrought to light in the preceding decade. We are probably safe in\r\nestimating the whole number of Pompeian paintings still in existence,\r\nor known from description, as about thirty-five hundred.\r\n\r\nIn all this wealth of examples, however, it is not possible to find\r\nany evidence of a progressive development either in composition or in\r\ntechnique. There are indeed slight differences, mainly in regard to\r\ntechnical handling and color scheme, which distinguish the paintings\r\nfound in the decoration of the third style from those of the other two\r\nstyles in which paintings appear; but, on the other hand, the\r\ndistinction between those of the second and those of the fourth style\r\nis much less marked.\r\n\r\nThe period from 80 B.C. to 79 A.D. was as little creative in the field\r\nof painting as in that of sculpture. No new types appear, no\r\nimprovements are worked out; the painter, as the sculptor, was an\r\neclectic, who drew upon the creations of the past as suited his fancy,\r\nand contented himself with copying or imitating. In the adaptation of\r\npaintings to decorative use the artist reproduced either entire\r\ncompositions or single motives which seemed to answer his purpose. The\r\ngeneral preference was for paintings of the Hellenistic age, after the\r\ndeath of Alexander; yet examples of earlier styles are occasionally\r\nfound, as the Sacrifice of Iphigenia (Fig. 156) and the dramatic scene\r\nin which Orestes and Pylades appear before King Thoas (Fig. 182).\r\n\r\nNew discoveries and the progress of research will sometime, perhaps,\r\nmake it possible to present a general survey of the Pompeian paintings\r\nfrom the historical and critical point of view. No such comprehensive\r\ntreatment is yet possible, however, and we must content ourselves with\r\noffering a few observations in regard to the distribution of the\r\npaintings among the different decorative styles and the classes of\r\nsubjects represented.\r\n\r\nThe Incrustation Style, as previously remarked, left no place for\r\npaintings upon the walls. Nevertheless, in isolated cases, we find a\r\nsimple pictorial representation upon the surface of one of the blocks\r\npainted in imitation of marble, as if the veins of the stone had run\r\ninto a shape suggestive of an object, as a vase or a bird; in one\r\ninstance, curiously enough, a wrestling match is outlined, between\r\nHercules and Antaeus. In the Tufa Period the desire for paintings was\r\nsatisfied by the mosaic pictures upon the floor.\r\n\r\nThe earlier walls of the second style in this respect resemble those\r\nof the first; the examples in the house of the Labyrinth have no\r\npaintings. The later walls, however, are rich in pictures, but those\r\nof Pompeii are not so abundantly adorned as those in Rome (p. 462).\r\nThe elaborate painting shown in the pavilion frame in Plate XII is\r\nexceptional among the Pompeian remains of this style.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of the paintings are found upon walls of the third\r\nand fourth styles. On the older walls of the third style, as we have\r\nseen, the principal painting appears in a frame, the design of which\r\nis taken from that of the conventional pavilion of the second style.\r\nIn later examples the close relation between the picture and the frame\r\nis no longer maintained; the frame simply encloses a large panel of\r\nuniform color, in the middle of which a relatively small picture is\r\nseen. This arrangement was carried over into the fourth style, but the\r\nconception of a pavilion frame is entirely lost sight of; the painting\r\nis in the middle of a large panel of brilliant color, around which the\r\narchitectural framework is extended. A Pompeian room well decorated in\r\neither of the later styles contained four of these prominent\r\npaintings, in case there was no door at the middle of one of the\r\nsides; if a door interfered, there were only three.\r\n\r\nPaintings were also placed in the divisions of the wall at the right\r\nand the left of the central panel. In Plate XII we noticed a single\r\nfigure on either side of the pavilion, but such additions are rare in\r\nthe second style. In the third style the side panels are uniformly\r\nadorned with paintings. In Fig. 263 the small figure in the middle of\r\nthe panel at the left is a Cupid; frequently a flying swan is seen, or\r\na landscape lightly sketched in monochrome on the ground of the panel.\r\nSometimes the painting is set off by a separate frame; if this is\r\nround, a bust is usually represented. Groups of two figures were\r\npreferred for the side panels of the fourth style, the favorite\r\nsubject being a satyr and a bacchante, as in Fig. 265; these sometimes\r\nappear as busts, but are more often represented as floating figures.\r\n\r\nCharacteristic of the fourth style, in respect to the distribution of\r\npaintings, is the use of single figures and simple compositions to add\r\nlife to the fantastic architectural designs in the upper part of the\r\nwall and in the divisions between the large panels. Here we may see\r\nsatyrs and bacchantes, young girls and solemn-visaged men with\r\nimplements of sacrifice; the figures appear in great variety of type\r\nand subject. Sometimes groups are broken up, and the elements of a\r\nmythological scene, as that of Admetus and Alcestis, are distributed\r\nas single figures in the architectural framework.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the eruption the fondness for pictorial representations\r\nwas increasing, and they were being introduced into every part of the\r\ndecoration, including the frieze of the main part of the wall, the use\r\nof which in this way commenced in the time of the third style (Fig.\r\n263), and the stripe below, between the main part of the wall and the\r\nbase (Fig. 265); how elaborate this intermediate decoration might\r\nbecome we have already seen in the case of the house of the Vettii.\r\n\r\nFrequently in the fourth style the lower part of the architectural\r\nframework separating two large panels appears to be closed, as in\r\nPlate XIII, by a narrow panel, above which a painting is seen. The\r\npictures found in these places often represent still life. Seafights\r\nare also a favorite subject; such may be seen in the temple of Isis,\r\nthe Macellum, and one of the rooms in the house of the Vettii.\r\nGenerally on the walls of the fourth style, wherever there is\r\navailable space, we find small pictures in great variety, the most\r\ncommon being landscapes, simply painted, with the use of few colors.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means easy to make a satisfactory classification of\r\nPompeian paintings according to subject. Nevertheless, with a few\r\nexceptions, they may be roughly grouped in four general classes,\r\nmythological paintings, genre paintings, landscapes, and still life.\r\nMost of the large and important pictures belong to the first class.\r\nThe mythological paintings will therefore be discussed at somewhat\r\ngreater length; the other three classes will require only a brief\r\ncharacterization.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 266.--A fruit piece, Xenion.]\r\n\r\nThe still-life paintings represent all kinds of meat, fish, fowl, and\r\nfruits. According to Vitruvius, this kind of picture was called\r\nXenion. The reason given for the name recalls a curious custom of\r\nancient Greece. When a guest, _xenos_, was received into a Greek home,\r\nsays this writer, he was invited to sit at the table for one day.\r\nAfter that provisions were furnished to him uncooked, and he prepared\r\nhis own meals. A portion of unprepared victuals thus came to be called\r\n_xenion_, 'the stranger's portion,' and the name was afterwards\r\ntransferred to pictures in which such provisions appear. A fruit\r\npiece, now in the Naples Museum, is shown in Fig. 266.\r\n\r\nLandscapes are numerous and of all sizes. Occasionally a garden wall\r\nof the fourth style is covered with a single large painting, in which\r\nvillas, gardens, roads, and harbors are realistically presented. Such\r\npictures are of Italian origin; the name of the artist who first\r\npainted them is probably Sextus Tadius, but the reading of the passage\r\nin which the name occurs (Plin. N. H. XXXV. x. 116) is uncertain.\r\n\r\nCommon to the third and fourth styles are garden scenes, in which,\r\nbehind a light barrier, the plants of a garden appear, with birds,\r\nstatues, and fountains. The finest extant example is in the villa of\r\nLivia, at Prima Porta, near Rome.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 267.--A landscape painting.]\r\n\r\nLarge landscapes sometimes have a place in the principal panels of the\r\nwalls. These are all of Hellenistic origin, and are found almost\r\nwithout exception in the decoration of the third style. They generally\r\nrepresent a quiet nook of woodland, with high cliffs; in the\r\nforeground is a shrine--perhaps more than one--with figures of men\r\nsacrificing or coming to offer worship.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of the landscapes, however, are introduced into\r\nvarious parts of the decoration outside of the large panels, and are\r\nquite small. In them we see little shrines or villas by the seaside; a\r\nriver with a bridge on which a traveller appears crossing the stream;\r\nor buildings on an island or peninsula in the edge of a body of water,\r\nas in Fig. 267. Often they are simply light sketches; now and then\r\none of these small landscapes is painted in a peculiar tint, as if the\r\nscene were represented by moonlight.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 268.--Group of women, one of whom is sounding two\r\n   stringed instruments.]\r\n\r\nThe genre paintings are of special importance on account of the light\r\nthey shed on the life and customs of the ancients. A number have\r\nalready been described or illustrated in the chapter on the house of\r\nthe Vettii, and in the part devoted to the trades and occupations. To\r\nthese we should add the picture of an artist in the house of the\r\nSurgeon (Fig. 128), and the scenes from the life of the Forum (Figs.\r\n16, 17).\r\n\r\nHere belong also the groups in which figures are seen with a roll of\r\npapyrus or a writing tablet, suggestive of literary pursuits, and\r\nfigures with musical instruments. A group of musicians is shown in\r\nFig. 268, in which are four women, one of whom is tuning a couple of\r\nstringed instruments to sound in unison.\r\n\r\nIn the same class are included two small painted busts not\r\ninfrequently met with, that of a girl with a writing tablet in her\r\nleft hand holding the end of a stylus against her lips, as if\r\npondering what to write, and that of a young man with one end of a\r\nroll of papyrus, in which he has been reading, under his chin. A\r\nPompeian baker, Publius Paquius Proculus, brought these two ideal\r\nbusts into one painting, substituting for the faces of the youth and\r\nmaiden those of himself and his wife (Fig. 269). The portraits are\r\nrealistic, but the faces are not unattractive; that of Proculus seems\r\nmore kindly and ingenuous than the face of Caecilius Jucundus (Fig.\r\n256).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 269.--Paquius Proculus and his wife.]\r\n\r\nTwo ideal painted busts have recently been found, each of a youth with\r\na roll of papyrus. Their chief interest lies in the fact that each\r\nroll is provided with a narrow tag or label, of the sort that the\r\nRomans called _index_, on which the names _Plato_ and _Homerus_ can be\r\nplainly read. The two types of face well correspond with the trend of\r\ntaste suggested by the titles: the delicate features and upturned gaze\r\nof the one indicate a poetic temperament; the other has a high\r\nforehead and an air of meditation, appropriate for a student of\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nThe mythological paintings rarely present rapid movement. To the few\r\nexceptions belong the two familiar pictures placed opposite each other\r\nin the tablinum of the house of Castor and Pollux, Achilles among the\r\ndaughters of Lycomedes on the island of Scyros, and the quarrel\r\nbetween Achilles and Agamemnon. Only part of the latter painting is\r\npreserved, but both are strong compositions, and are repeated on other\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nScenes of combat, the interest of which lies in the display of\r\nphysical force, are still more infrequently met with, and seem out of\r\nharmony with the prevailing taste. Two pictures from Herculaneum\r\nrepresent Hercules putting forth his strength; in one he is struggling\r\nwith the Nemean lion, in the other carrying the Erymanthian boar. The\r\nfew paintings of this kind at Pompeii are badly preserved. In two of\r\nthem Meleager appears, engaged in combat with the boar; in another we\r\nsee Achilles before the walls of Troy with drawn sword in one hand,\r\nwith the other grasping by the hair Troilus, an effeminate Trojan\r\nyouth, attired in Oriental fashion, who mounted on his horse is vainly\r\ntrying to escape; a fourth represents a combat between a heavy-armed\r\nwarrior and an Amazon. But such paintings are the more conspicuous by\r\nreason of their rarity, and those that have thus far been discovered\r\nare all found upon walls of the third style.\r\n\r\nA much larger number of mythological compositions represent a moment\r\nof dramatic interest, the artist relying for his effect upon the\r\nbearing and facial expression of the persons appearing in the scene.\r\nThe interest is purely psychological, and several of the pictures that\r\nhave been preserved give us an exceedingly favorable idea of the\r\nability of ancient painters to express emotion, especially when we\r\nremember that these paintings are merely decorative copies of\r\nmasterpieces the originals of which in most cases had probably never\r\nbeen seen by the workmen who painted the copies on the walls.\r\n\r\nAmong the more familiar examples is the face of Orestes in the\r\npainting found in the house of the Citharist (Fig. 182), and that of\r\nIo, watched by Argus, in the Macellum. Emotion is expressed with even\r\ngreater skill in the face of Io in a painting of the temple of Isis.\r\nThe goddess welcomes the wanderer to Egypt after her long season of\r\nsuffering; the traces of the suffering are clearly seen, yet are\r\nillumined by the ineffable and serene joy of final deliverance.\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful specimens of ancient painting is a fragment,\r\nbadly preserved, in the tablinum of the house of Caecilius Jucundus.\r\nThe composition probably represented Priam turning back toward Troy\r\nwith the body of Hector, which he had just ransomed. In the fragment,\r\nshown in Fig. 270, we see the aged Hecuba, together with a daughter or\r\nmaidservant, looking with unutterable anguish from an upper window\r\ndown upon the scene. The gray-haired queen, whose features still\r\nretain much of their youthful beauty, gazes upon the dust-stained body\r\nof her son with grief too deep for tears.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 270.--Hecuba with a younger companion looking from\r\n   an upper window as Priam brings back the body of Hector.]\r\n\r\nIn the majority of paintings the subjects of which are taken from\r\nmyths the characters are represented either in a relation of rest, not\r\nsuggestive of intense emotion, or in a lasting situation of dramatic\r\ninterest, which is devoid of momentary excitement and does not suggest\r\nthe display of evanescent feeling. The situation is sometimes\r\ncheerful, sometimes calculated to arouse sympathy; if the characters\r\nwere not mythological, the scenes might pass for those of everyday\r\nlife. Thus we see Narcissus looking at the reflection of his face in\r\na clear spring in the forest; Polyphemus, on the seashore, receiving\r\nfrom the hands of a Cupid a letter sent by Galatea; and Apollo playing\r\non the lyre for Admetus, while the herd grazes around him.\r\n\r\nTo the same series of cheerful or idyllic pictures belong the Selene\r\nhovering over the sleeping Endymion; Paris and Oenone on Mt. Ida,\r\nParis cutting the name of his sweetheart in the bark of a tree; and\r\nPerseus with Andromeda looking at the reflection of the head of Medusa\r\nin a pool. With these we may class also the representations of Bacchus\r\nas he moves along with his rollicking band and suddenly comes upon the\r\nsleeping Ariadne; and Hercules with Omphale, sometimes sitting in\r\nwoman's attire beside her and spinning, sometimes staggering in his\r\ncups or lying drunk upon the ground while she stands or sits near him.\r\n\r\nExamples of a pathetic situation are equally abundant. We find\r\nAphrodite caring for the wounded Adonis, and Cyparissus grieving over\r\nthe dead stag. The pathos of the scene, however, is not always so\r\nobviously suggested. The familiar painting of Europa represents the\r\nmaiden playfully sitting upon the bull, which one of her girlish\r\ncompanions is caressing. The situation, from one point of view, is\r\nidyllic, yet it brings to mind the unhappy fate of the girl, borne far\r\naway from home over the sea to a distant land, and the effect is\r\nheightened by giving her a wonderfully beautiful form.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently a similar result is produced by placing figures of\r\nincongruous type in sharp contrast; so in the oft-repeated composition\r\nin which the beautiful Thetis in elegant attire sits in the workshop\r\nof Hephaestus, looking at the shield which the rough and grimy smith\r\nis finishing for Achilles. In another composition Pasiphae is seen in\r\nthe shop of Daedalus, who points out the wooden cow; and a similar\r\nidea of contrast must have been present in the mind of the artist who\r\npainted Danae after she had been cast ashore in a chest on the island\r\nof Seriphus, sitting on the beach with little Perseus in her lap,\r\nwhile two fishermen standing near make inquiry concerning her strange\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nThe symmetrical arrangement of the paintings in a Pompeian room can\r\nhardly have failed to influence the choice of compositions for the\r\nprincipal panels, especially in cases in which mythological scenes\r\nwere to be represented. Sometimes, though not so frequently as might\r\nhave been expected, pictures were grouped according to subject. We\r\nhave already noticed the relation of two paintings, in the house of\r\nCastor and Pollux, in which Achilles is the principal figure. The\r\nfirst of these, Achilles among the daughters of Lycomedes, is found in\r\na room of another house in a group of three; one of the companion\r\npieces represents Thetis in the smithy of Hephaestus looking at the\r\nweapons which are being made for Achilles, while in the other she is\r\nseen riding over the sea on a Triton, bringing them to her son. There\r\nis another group of three pictures related by subject in a room in the\r\nhouse of the Vettii; they belong to the Theban cycle, and represent\r\nthe infant Hercules strangling the serpents, the death of Pentheus,\r\nand the binding of Dirce.\r\n\r\nSimilarity of scene and of treatment influenced the selection of\r\npaintings for a room much more often than unity of subject. A good\r\nillustration is the pair of pictures several times found together, one\r\nof which represents Polyphemus on the beach receiving from a Cupid a\r\nletter written by Galatea; in the other Aphrodite is seen on the\r\nseashore fishing, with Cupids all about her. The suggestion of Love is\r\ncommon to both paintings, but the juxtaposition of the two as\r\ncounterparts is due to the similarity of scene. Opposite the picture\r\nof Europa referred to above, is a Pan playing on his pipe, with nymphs\r\naround him; the two pictures, which appear in a room of the third\r\nstyle, from the decorative point of view form an effective pair.\r\n\r\nA sleeping room of the same style--though in respect to grouping no\r\ndifference between the styles is apparent--offers an interesting\r\nexample of a double group. The four principal paintings form two\r\npairs. In one pair we see, on one side, Hercules in the garden of the\r\nHesperides approaching an altar around which three maidens are\r\nstanding; on the other, a shrine of Artemis in a forest with three\r\nworshippers drawing near, one of whom brings a garland. The two\r\npictures harmonize in the character of the scenery and in the\r\narrangement of the figures.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of the other pair as a decorative counterpart can be\r\nseen in our illustrations; the subject of one of the paintings is the\r\nfate of the pipes which Athena cast aside (Fig. 271), and of the other\r\nthe fall of Icarus (Fig. 272).\r\n\r\nIn the first of the two pictures we have one of the few extant\r\nexamples of a kind of painting associated with the name of\r\nPhilostratus, in which different scenes representing the successive\r\nstages of an action are united in one composition.\r\n\r\nIn the foreground at the left sits Athena, with her shield on the\r\nground beside her, playing the double pipe; a nymph in front rising\r\nfrom the surface of a stream holds up a mirror in which the goddess\r\nmay see her face reflected as she plays.\r\n\r\nThe next two scenes lie just across the brook. At the foot of the\r\ncliff sits the divinity of the country, Phrygia, in which the story of\r\nMarsyas is localized. Above, at the left, we see the satyr with a\r\nshepherd's crook in his left hand blowing a Pan's pipe; he has not yet\r\nespied the pipes thrown away by Athena.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 271.--Athena's pipes and the fate of Marsyas.]\r\n\r\nAt the right he appears again, near the tree, having found the pipes\r\ndiscarded by the goddess and picked them up. Lastly, in the middle of\r\nthe background, we see him playing the pipes in the presence of the\r\nMuses, who are serving as judges in the contest of skill between the\r\nsatyr and Apollo.\r\n\r\nThe final scene with the flaying of Marsyas, which was sometimes\r\nrepresented in sculpture, and appears also in several Pompeian\r\npaintings, is here omitted.\r\n\r\nThe inner connection of the other picture is not so clear. It is\r\nperhaps a confused form of a composition in which Icarus, lying on the\r\nground after his fall, was the central figure; the local divinities\r\nand natives of the region were looking upon the body of the hapless\r\nyouth with pity; while Daedalus, hovering in the air above, was trying\r\nto find the spot where he had fallen.\r\n\r\nOur artist, however, thinking to heighten the effect, represented\r\nIcarus as plunging headlong through the air, with the result shown in\r\nthe illustration; neither Daedalus nor the figures in the foreground\r\nseem yet to have become aware of the catastrophe.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 272.--The fall of Icarus.]\r\n\r\nWe can in no way more appropriately bring to a close our brief survey\r\nof the Pompeian paintings than by presenting a reproduction of the\r\nscene in which Zeus and Hera appear on Mt. Ida (Fig. 273). This\r\npainting has been sufficiently discussed in another connection (pp.\r\n316-317); though preserved in a damaged condition, it clearly\r\nrepresents an original of no slight merit.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 273.--Zeus and Hera on Mt. Ida. Wall painting from\r\n   the house of the Tragic Poet.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI\r\n\r\nTHE INSCRIPTIONS OF POMPEII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI\r\n\r\n_IMPORTANCE OF THE INSCRIPTIONS.--MONUMENTAL INSCRIPTIONS AND PUBLIC\r\nNOTICES_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inscriptions discovered at Pompeii number more than six thousand.\r\nThey cover a wide field, ranging from commemorative tablets put up at\r\npublic expense to the scribblings of idlers upon the plastered walls.\r\nIt would be an exaggeration to say that they contribute to our\r\nknowledge of antiquity much that is new; their value lies rather in\r\nthe insight which they give into the life of the city and its people.\r\n\r\nIn one respect the evidence derived from inscriptions, though often of\r\nthe most fragmentary character, is especially satisfactory. We feel\r\nthat we are handling original documents, without the intervention of\r\nthat succession of copyists which stands between the author of a Greek\r\nor Roman masterpiece and the modern reader. The shapes of the letters\r\nand the spelling are just as they were left by the stonecutter or the\r\nscribbler; the various handwritings can still be as plainly\r\ndistinguished on the charred tablets of Caecilius Jucundus as though\r\nthe signatures were witnessed only yesterday. Through the inscriptions\r\nwe are brought into contact with the personality of the Pompeians as\r\nin no other way.\r\n\r\nThe inscriptions may be classified either according to the subject\r\nmatter or according to the form in which they appear, whether cut in\r\nstone, or painted, or scratched upon a smooth surface with a stylus.\r\nNo detailed classification need be given here; it will be sufficient\r\nfor our purposes to discuss the main divisions briefly under four\r\nheads,--monumental inscriptions and public notices, graffiti, and\r\ninscriptions relating to business affairs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMonumental inscriptions include those which are cut in hard material\r\nand are intended to be read by all who see them. They are found at\r\nPompeii chiefly in or upon public buildings, on pedestals of statues\r\nand on sepulchral monuments. They are characterized by extreme\r\nbrevity. A few are in the Oscan language, the rest are in Latin. The\r\nmore important examples have been presented in the preceding pages in\r\nconnection with the monuments to which they belong. A list of them is\r\ngiven in the Index under \"Inscriptions.\"\r\n\r\nThe public notices are painted upon the walls along the sides of the\r\nstreets, ordinarily in a bright red color; a few are in black. The\r\nmost important are the election notices, in which a candidate is\r\nrecommended for a public office. These are about sixteen hundred in\r\nnumber, and the names of more than a hundred different candidates\r\nappear in them.\r\n\r\nThe election notices fall into two classes, distinguished both by the\r\nstyle of writing and by the manner of expression,--earlier, from the\r\ntime of the Republic, and later, belonging to the Imperial period. The\r\nshapes of the letters in those of the former class are irregular, and\r\nbear the mark of an unpractised hand. The later notices, on the\r\ncontrary, have a more finished appearance; they are executed in a kind\r\nof calligraphic style that suggests the employment of skilled clerks\r\nwho made the painting of electoral recommendations a part of their\r\nbusiness. We have already met with the name of one painter of notices\r\nwho signed his work, Aemilius Celer (p. 223). His house has been\r\ndiscovered, near the northeast corner of the ninth Region; it was\r\nidentified by means of an inscription painted on the outside:\r\n_Aemilius Celer hic habitat_,--'Aemilius Celer lives here.'\r\n\r\nThe language of the earlier recommendations is of the simplest. We\r\nfind the name of the candidate with no suggestion of praise excepting\r\noccasionally the letters _v. b._, for _virum bonum_, 'good man.' The\r\nname of the office is given in an abbreviated form, but that of the\r\nperson who makes the recommendation nowhere appears. In one example\r\nthe elements of the common formula _o. v. f._, for _oro vos, facite_,\r\nare given almost in full: _M. Marium aed. faci., oro vos_,--'Make\r\nMarcus Marius aedile, I beg of you.' The following notice appears on\r\nStabian Street in letters nearly 8 inches high: P . FVR . II . V . \\B\r\n. O . \\F, that is _Publium Furium duumvirum, virum bonum, oro vos,\r\nfacite_,--'Make Publius Furius duumvir, I beg of you; he's a good\r\nman.'\r\n\r\nSome of the later election notices are almost equally brief,\r\npresenting merely the name of the candidate, the office for which he\r\nis recommended, and the formula _o. v. f._, as in this instance:\r\n_Herennium Celsum aed[ilem] o. v. f._,--'Make Herennius Celsus aedile,\r\nI beg of you.' Occasionally even the formula is omitted, and we have\r\nsimply the name of the candidate and of the office, both invariably in\r\nthe accusative case, as _Casellium aed._, which appears in several\r\nplaces, and _M. Holconium Priscum II. vir. i. d._\r\n\r\nMore frequently the recommendation includes a reference to the good\r\nqualities of the candidate. Sometimes he is simply styled 'a good\r\nman,' as in the earlier notices; but the most common formula in this\r\nconnection is _d. r. p._, for _dignum re publica_, 'worthy of public\r\noffice.' In some instances the characterization is more definite. More\r\nthan one candidate is affirmed to be 'an upright young man' (_iuvenem\r\nprobum_), or 'a youth of singular modesty' (_verecundissimum\r\niuvenem_). In regard to one aspirant for office we are informed that\r\n'he will be the watch-dog of the treasury'--_hic aerarium\r\nconservabit_.\r\n\r\nThe names of those who make the recommendations often appear in the\r\nlater notices. Now and then individuals assume the responsibility, as\r\nVesonius Primus (p. 396), and Acceptus and Euhodia (p. 341), who were\r\nundoubtedly owners of the property on which the notices appear. Thus\r\nthe candidate's neighbors are sometimes represented as favoring his\r\nelection, as in the case of Claudius Verus: _Ti. Claudium Verum II.\r\nvir. vicini rogant_,--'His neighbors request the election of Tiberius\r\nClaudius Verus as duumvir.' Electoral recommendations are painted on\r\nall sides of the house of Verus--the extensive establishment in the\r\nninth Region known as the house of the Centenary.\r\n\r\nThe class of election notices in which we find the members of a craft\r\nunited in the support of a candidate has been sufficiently illustrated\r\nin another connection (p. 384). To these we may add a recommendation\r\nfound on a wall facing the temple of Isis: _Cn. Helvium Sabinum aed.\r\nIsiaci universi rog[ant]_,--'The worshippers of Isis, as a body,\r\nrequest the election of Gnaeus Helvius Sabinus as aedile.' A suburb\r\nalso might have a candidate, as in the following instance: _M. Epidium\r\nSabinum aed. Campanienses rog._,--'The inhabitants of the Pagus\r\nCampanus ask for the election of Marcus Epidius Sabinus as aedile.'\r\n\r\nSometimes all those who are engaged in an occupation are urged to\r\nsupport a candidate. 'Innkeepers, make Sallustius Capito aedile,' we\r\nread in one notice. In others, various classes of citizens having a\r\ncommon bond, as the ballplayers, and the dealers in perfumes, are\r\nexhorted to work for the election of a candidate presumably favorable\r\nto their interests. In one instance there is a direct appeal to an\r\nindividual, involving a pledge of future support: _Sabinum aed[ilem],\r\nProcule, fac, et ille te faciet_,--'Proculus, make Sabinus aedile, and\r\nhe will do as much for you.'\r\n\r\nIn view of the deep interest in the municipal elections, revealed by\r\nthese notices, it is not surprising to find that the support of a\r\ncandidate by a man of unusual prominence was extensively advertised.\r\nIn three different parts of the city the attention of voters was\r\ndirected to the fact that Suedius Clemens, the commissioner sent by\r\nVespasian to decide the ownership of certain plots of ground (p. 407),\r\nfavored the election of Epidius Sabinus as duumvir. One of the notices\r\nreads: _M. Epidium Sabinum II. vir. iur. dic. o. v. f., dignum\r\niuvenem, Suedius Clemens sanctissimus iudex facit vicinis\r\nrogantibus_,--'At the request of the neighbors, Suedius Clemens, most\r\nupright judge, is working for the election of Marcus Epidius Sabinus,\r\na worthy young man, as duumvir with judiciary authority. He begs of\r\nyou to elect this candidate.'\r\n\r\nSo public a method of pressing a candidacy put a formidable weapon\r\ninto the hands of the candidate's enemies, and the form of a\r\nrecommendation was sometimes used against an office seeker with\r\ntelling effect. _Vatiam aed. furunculi rog._,--'The sneak thieves\r\nrequest the election of Vatia as aedile,' we find conspicuously\r\npainted on a wall on Augustales Street. According to other notices\r\nnear by, 'The whole company of late drinkers' (_seribibi universi_)\r\nand 'all the people who are asleep' (_dormientes universi_) favored\r\nthe candidacy of the same unhappy Vatia. The last notice which we\r\nshall present in this connection may have been painted on the order of\r\nthe girl who appears in it: _Claudium II. vir. animula facit_,--'His\r\nlittle sweetheart is working for the election of Claudius as duumvir.'\r\nThe reference is probably to the Tiberius Claudius Verus mentioned\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nThe other kinds of public notices are represented by relatively few\r\nexamples. Of special interest are the announcements of gladiatorial\r\ncombats, which were discussed in a previous chapter (p. 221). Next in\r\nimportance are perhaps the advertisements of buildings to rent. One of\r\nthese, relating to the Elephant Inn, has already been mentioned (p.\r\n400). We present here two others, which have to do with large\r\nproperties. The first, which has now disappeared, was painted on a\r\nwall in the sixth Region, at the south end of the third Insula. It\r\nreads as follows:--\r\n\r\n     INSULA ARRIANA\r\n     POLLIANA CN. ALLEI NIGIDI MAI\r\n     LOCANTUR EX K[alendis] IULIS PRIMIS TABERNAE\r\n     CUM PERGULIS SUIS ET CENACULA\r\n     EQUESTRIA ET DOMUS. CONDUCTOR\r\n     CONVENITO PRIMUM, CN. ALLEI\r\n     NIGIDI MAI SER[vum].\r\n\r\n'To rent, from the first day of next July, shops with the floors over\r\nthem, fine upper chambers, and a house, in the Arrius Pollio block\r\nowned by Gnaeus Alleius Nigidius Maius. Prospective lessees may apply\r\nto Primus, slave of Gnaeus Alleius Nigidius Maius.'\r\n\r\nThe word _equestria_, translated 'fine,' is used colloquially with\r\n_cenacula_, in the sense 'fit for a knight.' The Insula named after\r\nArrius Pollio was thought by Fiorelli to be the so-called house of\r\nPansa, across the street from the block on which the advertisement was\r\nfound. The identification may be correct, but a notice painted in so\r\nprominent a place might refer to a block in any part of the city.\r\n\r\nThe following inscription was found in the last century near the\r\nAmphitheatre, on a wall of the extensive establishment named from it\r\nthe villa of Julia Felix:--\r\n\r\n     IN PRAEDIS IULIAE SP. F. FELICIS\r\n     LOCANTUR\r\n     BALNEUM VENERIUM ET NONGENTUM, TABERNAE, PERGULAE,\r\n     CENACULA EX IDIBUS AUG. PRIMIS IN IDUS AUG. SEXTAS, ANNOS\r\n     CONTINUOS QUINQUE\r\n     S. Q. D. L. E. N. C.\r\n\r\n'To let, for the space of five years, from the thirteenth day of next\r\nAugust to the thirteenth day of the sixth August thereafter, the Venus\r\nbath, fitted up for the best people, shops, rooms over shops, and\r\nsecond story apartments in the property owned by Julia Felix, daughter\r\nof Spurius.'\r\n\r\nThe bath may have received its name from Venus Pompeiana. The word\r\n_nongentum_ is difficult to understand. The interpretation given is\r\nbased upon a passage of Pliny the Elder, from which we understand that\r\nin colloquial language the knights were known as 'the nine hundred.' A\r\nbath 'of the nine hundred' would then be one designed to attract the\r\npatronage of the best people. The seven letters at the end of the\r\ninscription have not yet been satisfactorily explained.\r\n\r\nAdvertisements of articles lost or found are also met with. A notice\r\nin regard to a stray horse, painted on one of the tombs east of the\r\nAmphitheatre, is given on p. 436. On the east side of Insula VIII.\r\nv.-vi. we read:--\r\n\r\n     VRNA AENIA PEREIT . DE . TABERNA\r\n     SEIQVIS . RETTVLERIT DABVNTVR\r\n     HS LXV . SEI . FVREM\r\n     DABIT .

If any one shall hand over the thief' ...\r\n(the rest of the inscription is illegible).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII\r\n\r\n_THE GRAFFITI_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe graffiti form the largest division of the Pompeian inscriptions,\r\ncomprising about three thousand examples, or one half of the entire\r\nnumber; the name is Italian, being derived from a verb meaning 'to\r\nscratch.' Writing upon walls was a prevalent habit in antiquity, as\r\nshown by the remains of graffiti at Rome and other places besides\r\nPompeii, a habit which may be accounted for in part by the use of the\r\nsharp-pointed stylus with wax tablets; the temptation to use such an\r\ninstrument upon the polished stucco was much greater than in the case\r\nof pens and lead pencils upon the less carefully finished wall\r\nsurfaces of our time. Pillars or sections of wall are covered with\r\nscratches of all kinds,--names, catchwords of favorite lines from the\r\npoets, amatory couplets, and rough sketches, such as a ship, or the\r\nprofile of a face. The skit, occasionally found on walls to-day,\r\n\r\n     'Fools' names, like their faces,\r\n     Are always seen in public places,'\r\n\r\nhas its counterpart in the couplet preserved as a graffito both at\r\nPompeii and at Rome: _Admiror, paries, te non cecidisse ruinis, Qui\r\ntot scriptorum taedia sustineas_,--\r\n\r\n     'Truly 'tis wonderful, Wall, that you have not fallen in ruins,\r\n     Forced without murmur to bear the taint of so many hands.'\r\n\r\nOf a similar vein is a Greek line scratched upon a wall on the\r\nPalatine hill in Rome: 'Many persons have here written many things; I\r\nalone refrained from writing.'\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, the graffiti are less fertile for our knowledge of\r\nPompeian life than might have been expected. The people with whom we\r\nshould most eagerly desire to come into direct contact, the cultivated\r\nmen and women of the ancient city, were not accustomed to scratch\r\ntheir names upon stucco or to confide their reflections and\r\nexperiences to the surface of a wall. Some of the graffiti, to judge\r\nfrom the height at which we find them above the floor, were\r\nundoubtedly made by the hands of boys and girls; for the rest, we may\r\nassume that the writers were as little representative of the best\r\nelements of society as are the tourists who scratch or carve their\r\nnames upon ancient monuments to-day. Nevertheless, we gain from these\r\nscribblings a lively idea of individual tastes, passions, and\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\nA few graffiti have reference to events, as the siege of Sulla, in 89\r\nB.C. (p. 240). The most interesting historical examples are those\r\nwhich relate to the conflict between the Pompeians and the Nucerians,\r\nin the year 59 A.D. (p. 220). An ardent Pompeian wrote: _Nucerinis\r\ninfelicia_,--'Down with the Nucerians!' From a scribbling by a\r\npartisan of the other side it appears that the inhabitants of Puteoli\r\nsympathized with the Nucerians, while those of Pithecusae--the island\r\nof Ischia--favored the Pompeians: _Puteolanis feliciter, omnibus\r\nNucherinis felicia, et uncu[m] Pompeianis [et] Pitecusanis_,--'Hurrah\r\nfor the Puteolaneans, good luck to all Nucerians; a hook for the\r\nPompeians and Pithecusans.' The hook referred to in this connection\r\nwas that used by executioners and the attendants of the Amphitheatre\r\nin dragging off the dead. Another Pompeian wrote: _Campani, victoria\r\nuna cum Nucerinis peristis_,--'Campanians, you were conquered by the\r\nsame victory with the Nucerians.' The Campani were not the inhabitants\r\nof Campania, but of the suburb called Pagus Campanus.\r\n\r\nTwo inscriptions, attesting the presence of members of the Praetorian\r\nGuard in Pompeii, have been previously mentioned (pp. 387, 401). Another\r\npraetorian left his name in a house of the eighth Region (VIII. iii.\r\n21): _Sex. Decimius Rufus milis coh[ortis] V pr[aetorianae] [^C]\r\nMartialis_,--'Sextus Decimius Rufus, a soldier of the fifth praetorian\r\ncohort, of the century led by Martialis.' To the same division of the\r\narmy probably belonged a centurion of the first rank, Q. Spurennius\r\nPriscus, whose name was found in a house of the first Region (I. iii.\r\n3). The first, fifth, and ninth praetorian cohorts, mentioned in the\r\ngraffiti, may have come to Pompeii with different emperors, or on\r\ndifferent occasions with the same emperor; it is unlikely that the three\r\nwere united to form a single escort.\r\n\r\nGraffiti are sometimes useful for the identification of buildings; so\r\nin the case of the Basilica and of several inns. The dated examples\r\nthrow some light on the age of the stucco on which they are found.\r\nThey are for the most part late, and afford little help in determining\r\nthe time of commencement of the various decorative styles; but in\r\nseveral cases they indicate a later limit clearly. In this way we\r\nlearn that the decoration of the Basilica, in the first style, was\r\nfinished before October 3, 78 B.C.--how long before we cannot tell;\r\nand that in 37 B.C. the plastering of the Small Theatre was already on\r\nthe walls, decorated in the second style. The gladiatorial graffito in\r\nthe house of the Centenary (p. 226) proves that the decoration of the\r\nroom in which it is found--a late example of the second style--was\r\nfinished before November, A.D. 15. A dated inscription of the reign of\r\nNero is given in the chapter on the house of the Silver Wedding (p.\r\n305).\r\n\r\nSeveral hundred graffiti present merely the name of the scribbler,\r\nsometimes with the addition _hic fuit_,--'was here,' or simply _hic_;\r\nas, _Paris hic fuit_, _Sabinus hic_.\r\n\r\nA large number contain a greeting, perhaps in some cases intended for\r\nthe eye of the person mentioned, as _Aemilius Fortunato fratri\r\nsalutem_,--'Aemilius greets his brother Fortunatus.' In this as in\r\nother examples it is interesting to note that one brother is\r\ndesignated by the gens name, the other by the cognomen. Sometimes the\r\ngreeting is the reverse of cordial, as in this instance: _Samius\r\nCornelio, suspendere_,--'Samius to Cornelius: go hang yourself.'\r\nHardly less naive is the message to a friend who has died: _Pyrrhus\r\nChio conlegae sal[utem]: moleste fero, quod audivi te mortuom;\r\nitaq[ue] vale_,--'Pyrrhus to his chum Chius: I'm sorry to hear that\r\nyou are dead; and so, Good-by.'\r\n\r\nThe most prominent theme of the graffiti is love, which is constantly\r\nreappearing, in prose scribblings and in snatches of verse. The verse\r\nform is usually the elegiac distich. Some of the lines are taken from\r\nthe poets; others were made up for the occasion, and not a few verses\r\nwere finished in prose, as if the would-be versifier found original\r\ncomposition more difficult than he had anticipated.\r\n\r\nSeveral distichs extol the power of love, as the following, which,\r\ntaken from some unknown poet, is found in several places: _Quisquis\r\namat, valeat, pereat qui nescit amare; Bis tanto pereat quisquis amare\r\nvetat_:--\r\n\r\n     'Good health be with you, lovers all;\r\n       Who knows not how to love, be cursed;\r\n     But oh may double ruin fall\r\n       On him who sets out love to worst!'\r\n\r\nA similar thought finds expression in a single line, perhaps also a\r\nquotation: _Nemo est bellus nisi qui amavit mulierem_,--'He who has\r\nnever been in love can be no gentleman.'\r\n\r\nNot all the Pompeians, however, viewed the matter so seriously. To the\r\nfirst line of the couplet just quoted a scribbler of a cynical turn in\r\none instance joined a parody, to the effect that those who are in love\r\nmay well avoid the use of hot baths, on the principle that 'the burnt\r\nchild dreads the fire,'--_Nam nemo flammas ustus amare potest._\r\n\r\nThe uselessness of interference with the course of love is also made\r\nprominent. In this distich, apparently from some poet, the scribbler\r\nseems to have made a slight change to meet a specific case,\r\nsubstituting _obiurgat_ for _custodit_ or some similar word: _Alliget\r\nhic auras, si quis obiurgat amantes, Et vetat assiduas currere fontis\r\naquas_,--\r\n\r\n     'Whoever has a mind\r\n       To hinder lovers' way,\r\n     Let him go zephyrs bind\r\n       Or running waters stay.'\r\n\r\nAncient lovers nevertheless had their fears, and the following\r\ncouplet, which is no doubt borrowed from a poet, appears also, in a\r\nslightly different form, on a wall in Rome: _Si quis forte meam cupiet\r\nviolare puellam, Illum in desertis montibus urat Amor_,--\r\n\r\n     'If any man shall seek\r\n       My girl from me to turn,\r\n     On far-off mountains bleak\r\n       May Love the scoundrel burn.'\r\n\r\nOf extant elegiac poets Ovid, Propertius, and Tibullus are quoted or\r\nparaphrased. Among the quotations is the familiar couplet of\r\nPropertius: _Nunc est ira recens, nunc est discedere tempus; Si dolor\r\nafuerit, crede, redibit amor_,--\r\n\r\n     'Now is it time to depart,\r\n       Now anger freshly burns;\r\n     When one ceases to feel the smart,\r\n       Believe me, love returns.'\r\n\r\nIf it was written by a lover after a quarrel, reconciliation was not\r\nfar off. Another discouraged suitor perhaps consoled himself by\r\nwriting on the wall of the Basilica this distich from Ovid's \"Art of\r\nLove,\" the form of which differs slightly from that given in the\r\nmanuscripts: _Quid pote tam durum saxso aut quid mollius unda? Dura\r\ntamen molli saxsa cavantur aqua_,--\r\n\r\n     'What is so hard as rock, or what can be softer than water?\r\n       Hard rocks nevertheless by water are worn away.'\r\n\r\nAmatory inscriptions often have the form of a message or greeting to a\r\nloved one, as in this example: _Victoria, vale, et ubique es, suaviter\r\nsternutes_,--'Health to you, Victoria, and wherever you are may you\r\nsneeze sweetly,' that is, may good luck follow you. Often the greeting\r\nis more ardent, as that to Cestilia: _Cestilia, regina Pompeianorum,\r\nanima dulcis, vale_,--'Cestilia, queen of the Pompeians, sweet soul,\r\ngreeting to you.'\r\n\r\nSometimes the lover avoided writing the lady's name: _Pupa quae bella\r\nes, tibi me misit qui tuus est; vale_,--'Maiden who are so beautiful,\r\nhe who is yours sent me to you; good-by.' Now and then we find an\r\ninscription of this class that leaves an unfavorable impression. The\r\nfollowing is repeated several times on the outside of a house in the\r\nfirst Region: _Serenae sodales sal[utem]_,--'Greeting to Serena, from\r\nher companions!'\r\n\r\nSpurned lovers also confided their woes to graffiti, sometimes adding\r\nan appeal to the obdurate one, as in this wretched couplet, which can\r\nscarcely have been taken from a poet; the play upon words in the last\r\nclause was apparently intentional: _Si quid amor valeat nostei, sei te\r\nhominem scis, Commiseresce mihi, da veniam ut veniam_,--\r\n\r\n     'If you a man would be,--\r\n       If you know what love can do,--\r\n     Have pity, and suffer me\r\n       With welcome to come to you.'\r\n\r\nIt was probably a lover in straits who scratched on the wall a line of\r\nthe Aeneid (IX. 404) as a prayer to Venus: _Tu, dea, tu praesens\r\nnostro succurre labori_,--\r\n\r\n     'Thou, goddess, with thy present help\r\n               Our sore distress relieve.'\r\n\r\nAnother unsuccessful suitor found the lines of a single poet\r\ninadequate to express his feelings, and joined together a couplet from\r\nOvid (Am. I. viii. 77-78) and one from Propertius (IV. v. 47-48) in\r\norder to voice his complaint against a miserly mistress who barred her\r\ndoor upon all except wealthy lovers. But the climax is reached in four\r\nlines of irregular verse in which the rejected lover proposes to vent\r\nhis anger on the goddess of love herself: 'All lovers, come! I purpose\r\nto break the ribs of Venus and to smash the small of her back with\r\nclubs; if she can bore a hole in my tender breast, why can I not break\r\nher head with a cudgel?' From the psychological point of view the\r\ncomplete identification of the goddess with a statue representing her\r\nis noteworthy.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a pair of lovers left on a wall a record of a meeting;\r\nthus, _Romula hic cum Staphylo moratur_,--'Romula tarried here with\r\nStaphylus.' Staphylus, however, was apparently a flirt; in the house\r\nof Caecilius Jucundus a similar meeting with another maiden is\r\nrecorded on a column of the peristyle: _Staphilus hic cum Quieta_. But\r\nStaphylus does not seem to have gained the confidence of the fair sex\r\nto the extent that another Pompeian gallant did, of whom we find it\r\nwritten: _Restitutus multas decepit saepe puellas_,--'Restitutus has\r\nmany times deceived many girls.'\r\n\r\nThe names of husband and wife are sometimes joined together, as in a\r\nroom of a house in the ninth Region: _L. Clodius Varus, Pelagia\r\nconiunx_; there is a similar example in a house ruined by the\r\nearthquake of the year 63, _[Ba]lbus et Fortunata, duo coiuges_.\r\n\r\nWe find a pleasing instance of marital affection in a graffito in\r\nwhich a lonely wife sends a greeting to an absent husband and other\r\nrelatives: _Hirtia Psacas C. Hostilio Conopi coniugi suo manuductori\r\net clementi monitori et Diodot[a]e sorori et Fortunato fratri et\r\nCeleri suis salutem semper ubique plurimam, et Primigeniae suae\r\nsalutem_,--'Hirtia Psacas at all times and in all places sends\r\nheartiest greeting to Gaius Hostilius Conops, her husband and guide\r\nand gentle adviser, and to her sister Diodota, her brother Fortunatus\r\nand her Celer; and she sends a greeting to her Primigenia, too.' The\r\nnames of both husband and wife are Greek, _psacas_ signifying\r\n'dewdrop,' and _conops_ 'gnat.'\r\n\r\nMany happenings are chronicled on the walls; and there are memoranda\r\nof every description. The programmes of gladiatorial combats have\r\nalready been mentioned (p. 223). One man records the result of a trip\r\nto Nuceria, where he won at the gaming table--without cheating, he\r\ntakes pains to add--a sum amounting to $130: _Vici Nuceriae in alia_\r\n(for _alea_) [*] _DCCCLVS, fide bona_,--'At Nuceria, I won 855.5\r\ndenarii by gaming, fair play.'\r\n\r\nAnother Pompeian counted the steps as he walked up and down the\r\ncolonnade at the side of his garden (in the house VII. ii. 41) for\r\nexercise; he recorded 640 paces for ten turns back and forth.\r\n\r\nIn the peristyle of a house in the first Region the advent of young\r\npigs, or of puppies, is noted: _XV K[alendas] Nov[embres] Puteolana\r\npeperit mascl[os] III, femel[as] II_,--'On October 17 Puteolana had a\r\nlitter consisting of 3 males and 2 females.'\r\n\r\nThe inscriptions relating to business transactions are reserved for\r\nanother chapter. We may notice here, however, that memoranda of\r\naccounts were sometimes scratched on walls, usually containing only\r\nthe figures indicating measure or price, as in the shops on the south\r\nside of the Macellum. The following is from a bakery in the first\r\nRegion (I. iii. 27): _Oleum, l[ibra], a[ssibus] IV; palea a. V; faenum\r\na. XVI; diaria a. V; furfure a. VI; viria I a. III; oleum a.\r\nVI_,--'Oil, a pound, 4 asses; straw, 5 asses; hay, 16 asses; a day's\r\nwages, 5 asses; bran, 6 asses; one wreath for the neck, 3 asses; oil,\r\n6 asses.' The value of the as varied; in the Early Empire it was\r\nnearly equivalent to 11/2 pence, or 3 cents.\r\n\r\nChildren scratched upon walls the alphabet that they were learning.\r\nThe frequent quotations from Virgil, generally incomplete, are\r\nlikewise an echo of lessons at school, where this author was carefully\r\nstudied; we find very often the beginnings of lines at the opening of\r\na book, as _Arma virumque cano_, or _Conticuere omnes_. The first word\r\nof the poem of Lucretius, _Aeneadum_, also occurs several times.\r\n\r\nOccasionally gnomic quotations are found, in most cases, perhaps, from\r\nwriters of comedy. Among them is the well-known maxim, _Minimum malum\r\nfit contemnendo maxumum_,--'The smallest evil, if neglected, will\r\nreach the greatest proportions.' A proverb more concrete in its form\r\nof statement is the following: _Moram si quaeres, sparge milium et\r\ncollige_,--'If you want to waste your time, scatter millet and pick it\r\nup again.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII\r\n\r\n_INSCRIPTIONS RELATING TO BUSINESS AFFAIRS_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important inscriptions relating to business transactions are\r\nthe receipts, discovered in 1875, which formed a part of the private\r\naccounts of L. Caecilius Jucundus (p. 447). They were written on wax\r\ntablets, which were carefully packed in a wooden box. The box, which\r\nwas in the second story of the house, crumbled to pieces when the\r\nvolcanic dust about it was removed; but many of the tablets, 154 in\r\nnumber, still retained their shape and were taken to the Naples\r\nMuseum. The wood of the tablets had turned to charcoal, but the\r\nwriting has been for the most part deciphered. One receipt dates from\r\n15 A.D., another from the year 27; the rest belong to the decade\r\nimmediately preceding the earthquake, 52-62 A.D. The documents are of\r\nthe greatest interest as casting light on the business methods of\r\nantiquity.\r\n\r\nMost of the tablets are triptychs. The three leaves were tied at the\r\nback so as to open like the leaves of a book, making six pages (Fig.\r\n274). The average height is about 5 inches, the width varies from 2 to\r\n4 inches. Pages 1 and 6 served as covers, being left smooth and\r\nwithout writing. Pages 2, 3, and 5 were hollowed out, leaving a\r\npolished surface with a raised rim around it. On this surface a thin\r\nlayer of wax was spread, in which the letters were made with a stylus;\r\nthe writing could be easily read because the wood, which was of a\r\nlight color, showed through wherever a scratch was made in the wax\r\ncoating.\r\n\r\nTwo pages facing each other, 2 and 3, were devoted to the receipt.\r\nPage 4, as shown in Fig. 275, was not hollowed out but was divided\r\ninto two parts by a broad, flat groove running across the middle. When\r\nthe document was ready to be sealed, the first two leaves were brought\r\ntogether and tied by a thread which passed around the middle, the\r\nends meeting in the groove on page 4. In this groove at convenient\r\ndistances melted wax was then dropped, on which the witnesses,\r\nordinarily seven in number, impressed their seals. The names of the\r\nwitnesses were written with pen and ink in a line with the seals,\r\nparallel with the sides of the page, sometimes at the right, as in\r\nFig. 275, sometimes divided, the first name and the gens name being at\r\nthe left of the seal, the cognomen at the right.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 274.--Tablet with three leaves, opened so as to\r\n   show the receipt and part of the memorandum on page 5, restored.]\r\n\r\nThis arrangement made it impossible to consult the receipt without\r\ncutting the thread or disturbing the seals of the witnesses. To meet\r\nthe difficulty a memorandum, which was practically a duplicate\r\nreceipt, was placed on page 5; this could be read at any time.\r\n\r\nThe difference in form between the receipt, on pages 2 and 3, and the\r\nmemorandum will be plain from the examples. The receipt, with few\r\nexceptions, is simply a record of an oral acknowledgment in the\r\npresence of witnesses that a sum of money was received, _accepti\r\nlatio_. In nearly all the tablets this acknowledgment and the names of\r\nthe witnesses, on page 4, are in the same handwriting, which must have\r\nbeen either that of Jucundus himself or of his secretary. It did not\r\nmatter who wrote the receipt; in case of a dispute the seals of the\r\nwitnesses would alone be sufficient to prove its genuineness. The\r\nmemorandum, however, was ordinarily in a different hand, either that\r\nof the person who gave the receipt, or of some one authorized to write\r\nfor him. As it was not under the seals of witnesses, the handwriting\r\nmight become a matter of importance if any question should arise in\r\nregard to the document.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 275.--Tablet, restored, with the two leaves\r\n   containing the receipt tied and sealed, and with the signatures of the\r\n   witnesses at the right of the seals.]\r\n\r\nThe entire tablet, with its receipt, memorandum, and names and seals\r\nof witnesses was called _perscriptio_, 'entry of account.' This word\r\nappears ordinarily on the edge of the tablet, with the name of the\r\nperson who gave the receipt in the genitive case.\r\n\r\nNearly all the tablets record transactions connected with auction\r\nsales, the person whose effects were thus disposed of giving Jucundus\r\na receipt in full for the proceeds of the sale less a commission,\r\n_mercede minus_. A few contain receipts for rent which Jucundus paid\r\nfor the use of property belonging to the city--a fullery (p. 394), the\r\nrent of which altogether amounted to 1652 sesterces, about $75; a\r\npasture, for the use of which he paid 2675 sesterces, about $130; and\r\na piece of arable land, _fundus_, on which he paid 6000 sesterces,\r\nabout $300, in rents.\r\n\r\nWe present an example of both classes of receipts. The first, which we\r\nmay call Tablet A, was given by a lady, Umbricia Januaria, for the\r\nproceeds of an auction sale; it is dated December 12, A.D. 56. The\r\nother, Tablet B, is the receipt for the rent of public pasture land\r\nand belongs to the year 59 A.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLET A\r\n\r\nTITLE\r\n\r\n_Perscriptio Umbriciae Januariae_, 'Entry of account of Umbricia\r\nJanuaria.'\r\n\r\nRECEIPT.

Vips. cos._\r\n\r\nThe language of the memorandum is so nearly identical with that of the\r\nreceipt that it is unnecessary to add a translation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA considerable number of the amphorae found at Pompeii bear\r\ninscriptions, generally written with a pen in black ink, but sometimes\r\npainted with a brush in red or white. Most of them contained wine. The\r\npercentage of Greek inscriptions is large, an evidence of the strength\r\nof the Greek population in the region about the city.\r\n\r\nThe wine underwent fermentation in large round vats of baked clay,\r\n_dolia_, which stood in the wine cellar of the villa, _cella vinaria_,\r\nor in a court (p. 364); from these the amphorae were filled. The vats\r\ncontaining the common wines were ordinarily emptied before the next\r\nvintage, when they were needed for the new wine, but the better sorts\r\nwere allowed to remain in the dolia for a longer time. The wine of one\r\nPompeian amphora was left in the vat till after the harvest of the\r\nsecond year: _C. Pomponio C. Anicio cos., ex fund[o] Badiano,\r\ndiff[usum] id. Aug., bimum_,--'Consulship of Gaius Pomponius and Gaius\r\nAnicius. From the Badian estate. Poured (into amphorae) August 13. Two\r\nyears old.' In what year Pomponius and Anicius were consuls we do not\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nThe earliest amphora of which the date is certain was filled in 25\r\nA.D.: _[Cosso Len]tulo M. Asinio cos. fund._ The place from which it\r\ncame, however, is not so easily determined, since _fund._ may refer to\r\nthe town of Fundi, or stand for _fundus_, 'estate,' the name that\r\nfollowed having been obliterated. The names of two such estates were\r\nlately recovered from amphorae in the house of the Vettii, _fundus\r\nSatrianus_ and _fundus Asinianus_.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the product of Italian vineyards the Pompeians used\r\nalso imported wines from the coast of Asia Minor and the islands near\r\nby. One dealer, M. Fabius Euporus, kept wine from Cnidus, _Cnidium_.\r\nWine from the island of Cos is frequently mentioned, as in this\r\ninscription: _Coum vet[us] P. Appulei Bassi_,--'Old Coan of Publius\r\nAppuleius Bassus.'\r\n\r\nDifferent kinds of wine were sometimes designated by characteristic\r\nnames. A certain Greek, M. Pomponius Teupon, produced a brand which he\r\ncalled 'Frenzy Wine' ([Greek: Lyttios]), as if so strong that it would\r\nmake the drinker frantic. Another Greek, Timarchus, named one of his\r\nwines 'White Drink,' [Greek: Leukounarion].\r\n\r\nAn amphora in the house of the Vettii was labelled _Gustaticium_,\r\n'Breakfast Drink'; it no doubt contained _mulsum_, a kind of mead made\r\nby mixing honey with wine, which the ancients drank with the first\r\nmeal of the day. The word _mulsum_ occurs on another amphora\r\ndiscovered previously.\r\n\r\nFruits and other edibles of all kinds were kept in amphorae. On one\r\nwas written: _Oliva alba dulce_ (for _olivae albae dulces_) _P. C.\r\nE._,--'White sweet olives of P. C. E.'; the name cannot be determined\r\nfrom the initials. On other amphorae the words for bean meal\r\n(_lomentum_), honey, and lentils appear, the last being designated by\r\nthe Greek word.\r\n\r\nA large number of small jars contained the fish sauces,--_garum_,\r\n_liquamen_, and _muria_,--of which the ancients were so fond;\r\nreference has already been made to Umbricius Scaurus (p. 15), who\r\nseems to have had several establishments for the making of the sauces,\r\nconducted by slaves, freedmen, and perhaps by members of his family.\r\n\r\nThe best quality of _garum_, which was probably a thick preparation, a\r\nkind of fish jelly, was designated by the letters _g. f._, for\r\n_garum--flos_, 'garum blossom,' as in the following inscription:\r\n_g[arum]--f[los] scombr[i] Scauri ab Eutyche Scauri_,--'Scaurus's\r\ntunny jelly, blossom brand, put up by Eutyches, slave of Scaurus.' We\r\nfrequently find _liquamen optimum_, 'best liquamen.'\r\n\r\nThe _muria_ was apparently a fish pickle, certain parts of the fish,\r\nor certain varieties, being preserved in brine. According to Pliny the\r\nElder some fish sauces were prepared in a special way, to be used by\r\nthe Jews on fast days; two of these, as already noted, appear in the\r\ninscriptions upon Pompeian jars, _garum castum_ and _muria casta_ (p.\r\n18).\r\n\r\nIn these inscriptions upon jars of various sizes the name of the\r\nproprietor is sometimes given, in the genitive case, as _M. Caesi\r\nCeleris_,--'Of M. Caesius Celer.' The name of the man to whom the\r\nconsignment is made is put in the dative, as _Albucio Celso_.\r\n\r\nThe name of the consignor sometimes follows that of the consignee, as\r\n_liquamen optimum A. Virnio Modesto ab Agathopode_,--'Best liquamen,\r\nfor Aulus Virnius Modestus, from Agathopus.'\r\n\r\nAn inscription similar to that just mentioned, on an amphora found in\r\nthe house of Caecilius Jucundus, illustrates the extent to which\r\nfamily pride might assert itself in the naming of children: _Caecilio\r\nIucundo ab Sexsto Metello_,--'To Caecilius Jucundus from Sextus\r\nMetellus.' The sender and the recipient were both sons of Lucius\r\nCaecilius Jucundus. According to common usage, one of the sons would\r\nhave received the name Lucius Caecilius Jucundus, after the father;\r\nwhile the other would have been called Lucius Caecilius, with a\r\ncognomen derived perhaps from the name of the mother. But the\r\nprosperous Pompeian wished to suggest a relationship with the\r\ndistinguished family of the Caecilii Metelli, so he named one son\r\nSextus Caecilius Jucundus Metellus, and the other Quintus Caecilius\r\nJucundus, the name Quintus being common in the family of the Caecilii\r\nMetelli. The names of the two sons are found together in an election\r\nnotice: _Q. S. Caecili Iucundi_,--'Quintus and Sextus Caecilius\r\nJucundus.'\r\n\r\nBesides the names of the makers, inscriptions relating to weight and\r\nownership are found on the cups and other objects of the Boscoreale\r\ntreasure. Thus on the under side of the Alexandria patera (Fig. 187, and\r\np. 380) we find the following record, the letters of which are outlined\r\nwith points: _Phi[ala] et emb[lema] p[endentia] p[ondo libras] II,\r\nuncias X, scrupula VI. Phi[ala] p[endens] p[ondo libras] II, uncias II,\r\nsemunciam; emb[lema] p[endens] p[ondo] uncias VII, semunciam_, 'The bowl\r\nand the relief medallion' together 'weigh 2 pounds, 10 ounces, and 6\r\nscruples. The bowl weighs 2 pounds, 21/2 ounces; the relief medallion\r\nweighs 71/2 ounces.' In giving the items separately no account was taken\r\nof the scruples. Reckoning the Roman pound as 327.453 grammes, the\r\nweight of the patera with its relief was 934.608 grammes, or 2.504 Troy\r\npounds. This differs from the present weight by less than a gramme.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a name in the genitive case is found with the record of\r\nweight, written with the same kind of letters; in such cases it is\r\nprobably safe to assume that the name is that of the original owner.\r\nOn the under side of one of the pair of cups ornamented with skeletons\r\n(Fig. 217) is the inscription: GAVIAE P.II.S[E]IIII; a later hand,\r\nwriting with a fine point, added VAS II in the space after GAVIAE, as\r\nif to supply an obvious omission, so that the inscription in full\r\nwould read, _Gaviae. Vas[a] II [pendentia] p[ondo libras] II, uncias\r\nVIII, [scrupula] IV_, 'The property of Gavia. The two cups weigh 2\r\npounds, 8 ounces, and 4 scruples' (2.351 Troy pounds).\r\n\r\nIn some instances the name of a later owner has been scratched on the\r\nsurface with a pointed tool. The name of a woman, Maxima, written in\r\nfull or in abbreviation, appears on forty-five of the pieces in the\r\nLouvre. We may safely accept the conclusion of De Villefosse, that she\r\nis probably the one who made the collection, obtaining her specimens\r\nfrom different sources, and that to her the Boscoreale treasure\r\nbelonged at the time of the eruption.\r\n\r\nBesides the seals which were used in signing documents the Romans had\r\nstamps, _signacula_, which they impressed upon various articles as a\r\nmeans of identification or as an advertisement. Impressions of such\r\nstamps are found upon bricks and other objects of clay, and in one or\r\ntwo instances upon loaves of bread. Several charred loaves in the\r\nNaples Museum have the stamp: _[C]eleris Q. Grani Veri ser._,--'(Made\r\nby) Celer, slave of Quintus Granius Verus.'\r\n\r\nThe names upon stamps appear regularly in the genitive case, as _N.\r\nPopidi Prisci_, spelled backward on the stamp, so that the letters\r\nappear in the right order in the impression. Since the time of\r\nFiorelli many houses have been named from the stamps found in them; in\r\nthe house of the Vettii, for example, two stamps were found with the\r\nnames of Aulus Vettius Restitutus and Aulus Vettius Conviva.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX\r\n\r\n_SIGNIFICANCE OF THE POMPEIAN CULTURE_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ideals of a nation--the true index of its culture--find expression\r\nalike in its laws, its literature, its art, and the environment of\r\ndaily life. They are a common heritage, which one generation passes on\r\nto another with its own increment of change, and their influence\r\nextends as far as that of the people whose spirit is manifested in\r\nthem. Thus it happens that the conditions of culture found in a single\r\ncity, unless that city, as Athens, had an independent development as a\r\nstate, are not isolated but are determined in the main by general\r\nmovements and tendencies, and are reproduced, with local differences,\r\nin all places having the same racial and political connections. The\r\nlocal element was more pronounced and more characteristic in ancient\r\nthan in modern cities; yet, unless the surroundings were exceptionably\r\nfavorable, we should not be warranted in expecting to find in a small\r\ncity an isolated development of special significance in art or taste.\r\nPompeii forms no exception to the rule.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Pompeii was unfavorable to the growth of an\r\nindigenous culture. Founded by Samnites, a primitive folk, it lay in\r\nthe overlapping edges of two great zones of influence, Greek and\r\nRoman. It was a small town, which never rose to the dignity even of a\r\nprovincial capital. It was a seaport, which through marine traffic\r\nkept in touch with other cities, especially those of the East, from\r\nwhich fashions of art, religion, and life travelled easily westward.\r\nThe political institutions of the Pompeians were at first those which\r\nthey shared in common with the Samnite and Oscan cities of the\r\nmountains and the Campanian plain, later those imposed upon them by\r\nthe forceful and levelling administration of Rome. The literature\r\nwhich they read, as we learn from quotations scratched upon the walls,\r\nconsisted of the Greek and Roman writers of their own or previous\r\nperiods; not a single line of an Oscan drama or poem has been found.\r\nTheir art was a reproduction of designs and masterpieces produced\r\nelsewhere,--at first under Hellenistic, later under Roman\r\ninfluence,--on a scale commensurate with the limited resources of the\r\nplace. Finally the countless appliances of everyday life, from the\r\nfixed furniture of the atrium to articles of toilet, were not rare and\r\ncostly objects such as were seen in the wealthy homes of Rome or\r\nAlexandria, but those of the commoner sort everywhere in use. Any one\r\nof fifty cities might have been overwhelmed in the place of Pompeii,\r\nand the results, so far as our knowledge of the ancient culture in its\r\nlarger aspects is concerned, would not have been essentially\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nThe representative rather than exceptional character of the remains at\r\nPompeii makes them either of less or of greater value, according as we\r\nlook at them from different points of view. If we are seeking for the\r\nmost perfect examples of ancient art, for masterpieces of the famous\r\nartists, we do not find them. Many of the Pompeian paintings appeal to\r\nmodern taste; yet it would be as unfair to judge of the merits of\r\nancient painting from the specimens which are worked into the\r\ndecorative designs of Pompeian walls as it would be to base an\r\nestimate of the value of modern art upon chromos and wall papers. For\r\nthe noblest creations of ancient art in any field we must look not to\r\nprovincial towns, but to the great centres of population and of\r\npolitical administration, where genius found encouragement,\r\ninspiration, and adequate means. No large city, fortunately for its\r\ninhabitants, was visited by such a disaster as that which befell the\r\nCampanian town; and the wealth of artistic types at Pompeii bears\r\nwitness to the universality of art in the Greco-Roman world.\r\n\r\nSince these remains are so broadly typical, they are invaluable for\r\nthe interpretation of the civilization of which they formed a part.\r\nThey shed light on countless passages of Greek and Roman writers.\r\nLiterature, however, ordinarily records only that which is exceptional\r\nor striking, while here we find the surroundings of life as a whole,\r\nthe humblest details being presented to the eye.\r\n\r\nPompeii, as no other source outside the pages of classical authors,\r\nhelps us to understand the ancient man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL APPENDIX[4]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.

Especially attractive are the sketches\r\nand restorations given by WEICHARDT, Pompeji vor der Zerstoerung, pp.\r\n17-33, pl. 1, 2 (reproduced in our pl. 3), and 3. The best description\r\nof the remains of the temple is given by KOLDEWEY and PUCHSTEIN, Die\r\ngriechischen Tempel in Unteritalien und Sicilien (Berlin, 1899), pp.\r\n45-49 and pl. 5; their conclusions are criticised by MAU, Roem. Mitth.,\r\nvol. 15 (1900), pp. 126-128. See also VON DUHN and JACOBI, Der\r\ngriechische Tempel in Pompeji (Heidelberg, 1890); SOGLIANO, Il tempio\r\nnel Foro triangolare di Pompei, Mon. dei Lincei, vol. 1 (1890), pp.\r\n189-200; both these contributions are reviewed by MAU, Roem. Mitth.,\r\nvol. 6 (1891), pp. 258-267.\r\n\r\n_The colonnade contained ninety-five Doric columns_ [p. 135]: there\r\nwere in addition two half-columns at the south end; Plan III in this\r\nrespect is inexact. The number of columns is often given as one\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\n_Inscriptions of the sundial and the pedestal_ [p. 136]: C. I. L. X.\r\n831, 832.\r\n\r\n_Number of columns in the temple front uneven_ [p. 137]: the steps are\r\ntoo broad for one intercolumniation, and must have been designed for\r\ntwo, as indicated in Fig. 62.\r\n\r\n_Human bones found in the enclosure_ [p. 139]: ROMANELLI, Viaggio a\r\nPompei (1811), p. 104 (Edit. 2, 1817, p. 182), \"Vi furono trovati\r\nmolti avanzi di cadaveri sepolti.\" Excavations made here at the\r\nsuggestion of Professor Mau brought to light few traces of bones.\r\n\r\n_Oscan inscription_ [p. 139]: ZVETAIEFF, Sylloge inscriptionum Oscarum\r\n(Leipzig, 1868), no. 69 and pl. 13; VON PLANTA, Grammatik der\r\nOskisch-Umbrischen Inschriften, vol. 2, p. 501; CONWAY, Italic\r\nDialects, vol. 1, p. 63.\r\n\r\n_Oscan inscription_ [p. 140]: see references below, pp. 530-531.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. THE LARGE THEATRE\r\n\r\n_Excavation of the two theatres and the court behind the Large\r\nTheatre_ (July, 1764, to March, 1765; and December, 1791, to\r\nFebruary, 1796): FIORELLI, Pomp. ant. hist., vol. 1, pt. 1, pp.\r\n158-165, pt. 2, pp. 46-63.

Studien, pp. 232-253; OVERBECK-MAU, Pompeji, pp.\r\n153-176.\r\n\r\n_The tribunals_ [p. 145]: it is evident from the language of Suetonius\r\n(Div. Aug. 44, solis virginibus Vestalibus locum in theatro separatim\r\net contra praetoris tribunal dedit) that opposite the place set aside\r\nfor the praetor, which was called tribunal, there was another likewise\r\nreserved. In our theatre the two platforms mentioned correspond\r\nexactly with this arrangement, and there is no other part of the\r\nstructure to which the word _tribunalia_, in the inscription of the\r\nHolconii (p. 148), could properly be applied. We are safe therefore in\r\ncalling the platforms tribunals.\r\n\r\n_Wall painting, showing theatre police seated in niches in front of\r\nthe stage_ [p. 146]: found in the casa della fontana grande; described\r\nby HELBIG, Wandgemaelde, no. 1468; figured in Museo Borb., vol. 4, pl.\r\n18, and in WIESELER, Theatergebaeude und Denkmaeler des Buehnenwesens bei\r\nden Griechen und Roemern (Goettingen, 1851), pl. 11, 2.

I. L. IV. 1182; the inscription of the\r\ntomb itself is given, C. I. L. X. 1024. In his interpretation of the\r\nreliefs Mazois incorrectly assumed (op. cit., pp. 47-48) that on\r\naccount of the baiting of a bear by one of the figures with a cloth\r\nthe tomb could not have been built before the time of Claudius. The\r\npassage cited by him (Plin. N. H. VIII. XVI. 54) has no bearing on the\r\ndate; but the tomb of Scaurus, which belongs neither to the oldest nor\r\nto the most recent, may well have been built in the time of Claudius\r\nor of Nero.\r\n\r\n_Ship on the tomb of Naevoleia Tyche_ [p. 423]: JORDAN, Ann. dell'\r\nInst., vol. 44 (1872), pp. 20-26; VISCONTI, Fronte di Sarcofago con\r\nTritoni e navi, Bull. Com., vol. 1 (1872-1873), pp. 255-269; cf. Cic.\r\nDe Sen. XIX. 71. Petronius (Sat. LXXI.) humorously represents\r\nTrimalchio as ordering 'ships under full sail' among the carvings of\r\nhis tomb.\r\n\r\n_Inscription of Salvius_ [p. 426]: found, according to C. I. L. X.\r\n1032, beside the tomb of Naevoleia Tyche; but we have the testimony of\r\nBONUCCI (Pompei, 1830, p. 37) to the effect that it was found in the\r\nniche where it now is, where it exactly fits the cavity. The mistake\r\nin the Corpus may have arisen from a misunderstanding of the report of\r\nthe excavation, which is now unfortunately lost.\r\n\r\n_M. Alleius Luccius Libella_ [p. 426]: the name was originally Luccius\r\nLibella, with what praenomen is not clear; but Luccius Libella married\r\nthe daughter of M. Alleius (M. Alleius Nigidius Maius?) and was\r\nadopted by him, assuming his praenomen and nomen, so that the full\r\nname took the form given in the inscription. The son dropped the\r\noriginal nomen Luccius, and was called simply M. Alleius Libella. In\r\nlike manner the name of the son of D. Lucretius Satrius Valens became\r\nD. Lucretius Valens [p. 222].\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.

SCULPTURE\r\n\r\n_Of the sculptures found at Pompeii_: Very few of the sculptures\r\nunearthed at Pompeii are treated or reproduced in the comprehensive\r\nworks on ancient sculpture. The more important statues and reliefs\r\nfound prior to 1865, as well as those discovered in Herculaneum, are\r\npublished in the Real Museo Borbonico, with descriptive text; see the\r\nIndex at the end of vol. 16, pp. 8-34. They are reproduced also by\r\nROUX, with descriptive text by Barre, Herculanum et Pompei, vols. 6\r\nand 7 (first part). These engravings, while in many cases faulty, are\r\noften serviceable to students at a distance in the identification of\r\nphotographs, which are easily obtained through the Naples dealers. The\r\nbetter terra-cottas are published by VON ROHDEN, Die Terracotten von\r\nPompeji (Stuttgart, 1880). A somewhat fuller treatment of Pompeian\r\nsculpture is given in OVERBECK-MAU, Pompeji, pp. 532-563.\r\n\r\n_Heads of Epicurus, Demosthenes, and Callimachus_ [p. 447]: MAU, Bull.\r\ndell' Inst., 1876, pp. 242-243; BRIZIO, Ann. dell' Inst., vol. 45\r\n(1873), pp. 98-106; MOMMSEN and ROBERT, Archaeologische Zeitung, 1880,\r\npp. 32-36; Comparetti, La Villa Ercolanese dei Pisoni (Torino, 1883),\r\npp. 33-53, pl.

A further reason why\r\nBrutus cannot be represented in the Naples bust is that the similar\r\nbust in the Capitoline Museum in Rome (HELBIG, op. cit., no. 536)\r\nshows a person well on in years, while the prominence of Brutus lasted\r\nonly for a brief period, and it is not likely that there should be\r\npreserved to us portraits representing him at periods so entirely\r\ndifferent. _Susa mosaic_: Comptes rendus de l'Academie des\r\nInscriptions et Belles-lettres, serie 4, vol. 24 (Paris, 1896), pp.\r\n578-581 and pl. after p. 580; GAUCKLER, Les Mosaiques virgiliennes de\r\nSousse, Monuments et Memoires publiees par l'Academie des Inscriptions\r\net Belles-lettres, vol. 4 (Fondation Piot, 1897), pp. 233-234; FOWLER,\r\nPortraits of Virgil, School Review, vol. 6 (1898), pp. 598-605;\r\nArchaeologischer Anzeiger, Beiblatt zum Jahrb. des Inst., vol. 13\r\n(1898), p. 114.\r\n\r\n_Aphrodite and Spes_ [p. 450]: MAU, Bull, dell' Inst., 1873, pp.\r\n233-235.\r\n\r\n_Artemis_ [p. 450]: often reproduced, as Museo Borb., vol. 2, pl. 8;\r\nROUX, Herculanum et Pompei, vol. 6, pl. 76, 77; BRUNN and BRUCKMANN,\r\nDenkmaeler griechischer und roemischer Sculptur, no. 356.\r\n_Identification with Artemis Laphria_ (Paus.

Hauser in the article cited makes it appear probable that the\r\nfigure had originally a somewhat different pose; the right foot rested\r\nflat upon the base, the left only on the heel, so that the body,\r\ninstead of leaning forward, was slightly bent back. The present pose,\r\nhowever, was given to the figure in antiquity; according to G.\r\nPatroni, the wedge of lead under the right foot was in its present\r\nplace when the statuette was discovered.\r\n\r\n_Ephebus of 1900_ [p. 453]: Not. d. scavi, 1900, pp. 584-587 (7\r\nillustrations); SOGLIANO, L'efebo in bronzo rinvenuto in Pompei, Mon.\r\ndei Lincei, vol. 10 (1901), pp. 641-654, pl. 16-26. This statue is\r\nassigned to the Roman period by WALDSTEIN, The Monthly Review, 1901,\r\npp. 125-126, and PETERSEN, Roem. Mitth., vol. 16 (1901), p. 96.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV. PAINTING. WALL DECORATION\r\n\r\n_Technique of Pompeian painting_: DONNER, Die erhaltenen antiken\r\nWandmalereien in technischer Beziehung, printed as an introduction to\r\nHelbig's Wandgemaelde (see Chap. LV.), pp. I--CXXVII; MAU, Geschichte\r\nder decorativen Wandmalerei in Pompeji (Berlin, 1882; with atlas of 20\r\nplates).\r\n\r\n_Specimen illustrations_: Many entire walls as well as single\r\npaintings are reproduced in color in the extensive works by ZAHN, Die\r\nschoensten Ornamente und merkwuerdigsten Gemaelde aus Pompeji, Herkulanum\r\nund Stabiae, nebst einigen Grundrissen und Ansichten (Mit deutschem\r\nund franzoesischem Text. Drei Abtheilungen in 30 Heften, 302 Tafeln.\r\nBerlin, 1827-1859); and NICCOLINI, Le case ed i monumenti di Pompei\r\ndesignati e descritti (Naples, 1854-1901). Both works are rarely found\r\ncomplete, and the plates of the second in particular leave much to be\r\ndesired in respect to drawing as well as coloring; it has therefore\r\nbeen thought best not to encumber these notes with detailed references\r\nto them. A number of walls are shown also by ROUX, Herculanum et\r\nPompei (8 vols., Paris, 1840), vol. 1 (108 plates), and by D'AMELIO,\r\nDipinti Murali di Pompei, Naples, 1888. Professor Mau has in\r\npreparation a new work on wall decoration which will be illustrated by\r\ncolored plates similar to those in the atlas to his Wandmalerei. The\r\nsources of the illustrations in this and the following chapter are\r\ngiven in our List of Illustrations, p. xxv.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the wall_ [p. 456]: Vitr. VII.

THE PAINTINGS\r\n\r\n_Of the paintings in general_: the paintings discovered prior to 1868\r\nare described, with references to the literature, by W. HELBIG,\r\nWandgemaelde der vom Vesuv verschuetteten Staedte Campaniens (Nebst\r\neiner Abhandlung ueber die antiken Wandmalereien in Technischer\r\nBeziehung, von Otto Donner, Leipzig, 1868); those discovered after the\r\npublication of Helbig's work and before 1880, by A. SOGLIANO, Le\r\npitture murali Campane scoverte negli anni 1867-1879 (supplemento all'\r\nopera dell' Helbig, Naples, 1879. Published also in the volume, Pompei\r\ne la regione sotterrata dal Vesuvio, for which see p. 513); those that\r\nhave come to light since 1879 are described by MAU in his reports (see\r\nnote to Chap. IV) and in the Notizie degli scavi; cf. also HELBIG,\r\nUntersuchungen ueber die campanische Wandmalerei (Leipzig, 1873).\r\nBesides the reproductions of paintings by ZAHN and NICCOLINI mentioned\r\nabove (p. 544), the more important examples are published in the Real\r\nMuseo Borbonico (see Index at the end of vol. 16, pp. 37-58); ROUX,\r\nHerculanum et Pompei, vols. 1-5 (Paris, 1840); ROCHETTE, Choix de\r\npeintures de Pompei, la plupart de sujet historique (lithographiees en\r\ncouleur par M.

The colored plates\r\npresented by A. NICCOLINI, Arte Pompeiana Monumenti scelti (a\r\nselection of 55 plates from the larger work, Naples, 1888), give a\r\nfalse idea of the paintings reproduced.\r\n\r\n_No evidence of development in composition or technique_ [p. 471]: cf.\r\nWICKHOFF, Roman Art, pp. 139 ff.\r\n\r\n_Hercules and Antaeus_ [p. 472]: Bull. dell' Inst., 1876, p. 101;\r\nSOGLIANO, Le pitture murali Campane, no. 495.\r\n\r\n_Mosaic pictures on the floor_ [p. 472]: as in the house of the Faun;\r\nsee references on p. 533.

MARION CRAWFORD says of this work: \"Professor Mau has succeeded\r\nbeyond all those who have preceded him on the same ground. He\r\nreconstructs the ruins so that one believes in them, and sees that\r\nthey must have been as he describes them, and the excellent drawings\r\nof these reconstructions stimulate the reader's belief. He restores\r\nthe decorations next, and furnishes the vacant dwellings in a way that\r\nseems natural, and even comfortable; and, lastly, he populates the\r\ncity he has so skilfully rebuilt, not with the dull lay figures in\r\ntogas or tunics so dear to scientific history, but with human beings,\r\nalive and moving.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_IN PREPARATION FOR EARLY ISSUE_\r\n\r\nANCIENT ATHENS\r\n\r\n     By =ERNEST ARTHUR GARDNER=, Yates Professor of Archaeology in\r\n     University College, London. Formerly Director of the British\r\n     School at Athens. Author of \"A Handbook of Greek Sculpture,\"\r\n     etc., etc. Cloth, 8vo. Profusely illustrated.\r\n\r\nThis handsomely illustrated book is a companion volume in its make-up\r\nto Mau's \"Pompeii.\" Its object is to give an adequate and at the same\r\ntime popular account of Ancient Athens, from the earliest times down\r\nto the official introduction of Christianity. The book deals mainly\r\nwith the topography of the city and Acropolis, the extant remains of\r\nancient buildings, and the sculpture that decorated them. It includes\r\nthe results of recent excavation and research; but controversial\r\nmatters have, as far as possible, been relegated to notes and\r\nappendices. A full description is given of the Parthenon, the\r\nErechtheum, Theatre, and other buildings, and such questions as the\r\nwater supply, the walls of town and harbours, the position of the\r\nAgora, and the route Pausanias, are duly considered. The general aim\r\nof the author is to stimulate and assist the historical imagination by\r\nbringing Ancient Athens, in various periods of its growth, vividly\r\nbefore the eyes of the ordinary well-informed reader, and to provide\r\nboth those who have visited Greece and those who have not with views\r\nand plans and illustrations to enable them to realize the present\r\nappearance of the town and its monuments. For this purpose the book is\r\nvery fully illustrated, as far as possible, by means of photography.\r\nAbove all, the author has avoided, as far as possible, compilation or\r\nquotation from various writers, and has endeavored to give a direct\r\nrecord of the impressions derived from a familiarity with the sites\r\nand buildings described.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE MACMILLAN COMPANY\r\n     66 FIFTH AVENUE, NEW YORK",
