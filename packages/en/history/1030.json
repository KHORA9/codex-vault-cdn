The rude but often\r\nbeautiful political lyrics of the early days of the Stuarts were far more\r\ninteresting and important to the people who heard or repeated them, than\r\nany similar compositions can be in our time.  When the printing press was\r\nthe mere vehicle of polemics for the educated minority, and when the\r\ndaily journal was neither a luxury of the poor, a necessity of the rich,\r\nnor an appreciable power in the formation and guidance of public opinion,\r\nthe song and the ballad appealed to the passion, if not to the intellect\r\nof the masses, and instructed them in all the leading events of the time.\r\nIn our day the people need no information of the kind, for they procure\r\nit from the more readily available and more copious if not more reliable,\r\nsource of the daily and weekly press.  The song and ballad have ceased to\r\ndeal with public affairs.  No new ones of the kind are made except as\r\nmiserable parodies and burlesques that may amuse sober costermongers and\r\nhalf-drunken men about town, who frequent music saloons at midnight, but\r\nwhich are offensive to every one else.  Such genuine old ballads as\r\nremain in the popular memory are either fast dying out, or relate\r\nexclusively to the never-to-be-superseded topics of love, war, and wine.\r\nThe people of our day have little heart or appreciation for song, except\r\nin Scotland and Ireland.  England and America are too prosaic and too\r\nbusy, and the masses, notwithstanding all their supposed advantages in\r\neducation, are much too vulgar to delight in either song or ballad that\r\nrises to the dignity of poetry.  They appreciate the buffooneries of the\r\n“Negro Minstrelsy,” and the inanities and the vapidities of sentimental\r\nlove songs, but the elegance of such writers as Thomas Moore, and the\r\nforce of such vigorous thinkers and tender lyrists as Robert Burns, are\r\nabove their sphere, and are left to scholars in their closets and ladies\r\nin their drawing-rooms.  The case was different among our ancestors in\r\nthe memorable period of the struggle for liberty that commenced in the\r\nreign of Charles I.  The Puritans had the pulpit on their side, and found\r\nit a powerful instrument.  The Cavaliers had the song writers on theirs,\r\nand found them equally effective.  And the song and ballad writers of\r\nthat day were not always illiterate versifiers.  Some of them were the\r\nchoicest wits and most accomplished gentlemen of the nation.  As they\r\ncould not reach the ears of their countrymen by the printed book, the\r\npamphlet, or the newspaper, nor mount the pulpit and dispute with\r\nPuritanism on its own ground and in its own precincts, they found the\r\nsong, the ballad, and the epigram more available among a musical and\r\nsong-loving people such as the English then were, and trusted to these to\r\nkeep up the spirit of loyalty in the evil days of the royal cause, to\r\nteach courage in adversity, and cheerfulness in all circumstances, and to\r\nridicule the hypocrites whom they could not shame, and the tyrants whom\r\nthey could not overthrow.  Though many thousands of these have been\r\npreserved in the King’s Pamphlets in the British Museum, and in other\r\ncollections which have been freely ransacked for the materials of the\r\nfollowing pages, as many thousands more have undoubtedly perished.\r\nOriginally printed as broadsides, and sold for a halfpenny at country\r\nfairs, it used to be the fashion of the peasantry to paste them up in\r\ncupboards, or on the backs of doors, and farmers’ wives, as well as\r\nservant girls and farm labourers, who were able to read, would often\r\npaste them on the lids of their trunks, as the best means of preserving\r\nthem.  This is one reason why so many of them have been lost without\r\nrecovery.  To Sir W. C. Trevelyan literature is indebted for the\r\nrestoration of a few of these waifs and strays, which he found pasted in\r\nan old trunk of the days of Cromwell, and which he carefully detached and\r\npresented to the British Museum.  But a sufficient number of these flying\r\nleaves of satire, sentiment, and loyalty have reached our time, to throw\r\na curious and instructive light upon the feelings of the men who resisted\r\nthe progress of the English Revolution; and who made loyalty to the\r\nperson of the monarch, even when the monarch was wrong, the first of the\r\ncivic virtues.  In the superabundance of the materials at command, as\r\nwill be seen from the appended list of books and MSS. which have been\r\nconsulted and drawn upon to form this collection, the difficulty was to\r\nkeep within bounds, and to select only such specimens as merited a place\r\nin a volume necessarily limited, by their celebrity, their wit, their\r\nbeauty, their historical interest, or the light they might happen to\r\nthrow on the obscure biography of the most remarkable actors in the\r\nscenes which they describe.  It would be too much to claim for these\r\nballads the exalted title of poetry.  They are not poetical in the\r\nhighest sense of the word, and possibly would not have been so effective\r\nfor the purpose which they were intended to serve, if their writers had\r\nbeen more fanciful and imaginative, or less intent upon what they had to\r\nsay than upon the manner of saying it.  But if not extremely poetical,\r\nthey are extremely national, and racy of the soil; and some of them are\r\ncertain to live as long as the language which produced them.  For the\r\nconvenience of reference and consultation they have been arranged\r\nchronologically; beginning with the discontents that inaugurated the\r\nreign of Charles I., and following regularly to the final, though\r\nshort-lived, triumph of the Cavalier cause, in the accession of James II.\r\nAfter his ill-omened advent to the throne, the Cavalier became the\r\nJacobite.  In this collection no Jacobite songs, properly so called, are\r\nincluded, it being the intention of the publishers to issue a companion\r\nvolume, of the Jacobite Ballads of England, from the accession of James\r\nII. to the battle of Culloden, should the public receive the present\r\nvolume with sufficient favour to justify the venture.\r\n\r\nThe Editor cannot, in justice to previous fellow-labourers, omit to\r\nrecord his obligation to the interesting volume, with its learned\r\nannotations, contributed by Mr Thomas Wright to the Percy Society; or to\r\nanother and equally valuable collection, edited by Mr J. O.

The\r\nsong, says Mr Chappell, is ascertained to be by Martin Parker, by the\r\nfollowing extract from the _Gossips’ Feast_, or Moral Tales, 1647.  “By\r\nmy faith, Martin Parker never got a fairer treat: no, not when he indited\r\nthat sweet ballad, When the King enjoys his own again.”  In the poet’s\r\nBlind Man’s Bough (or Buff), 1641, Martin Parker says,\r\n\r\n    “Whatever yet was published by me\r\n    Was known as Martin Parker, or M. P.;”\r\n\r\nbut this song was printed without his name or initials, at a time when it\r\nwould have been dangerous to give either his own name or that of his\r\npublisher.  Ritson calls it the most famous song of any time or country.\r\nInvented to support the declining interest of Charles I., it served\r\nafterwards with more success to keep up the spirits of the Cavaliers, and\r\npromote the restoration of his son; an event which it was employed to\r\ncelebrate all over the kingdom.  At the Revolution of 1688, it of course\r\nbecame an adherent of the exiled King, whose cause it never deserted.  It\r\ndid equal service in 1715 and 1745.  The tune appears to have been\r\noriginally known as _Marry me_, _marry me_, _quoth he_, _bonnie lass_.\r\nBooker, Pond, Hammond, Rivers, Swallow, Dade, and “The Man in the Moon,”\r\nwere all astrologers and Almanac makers in the early days of the civil\r\nwar.  “The Man in the Moon” appears to have been a loyalist in his\r\npredictions.  Hammond’s Almanac is called “bloody” because the compiler\r\nalways took care to note the anniversary of the death, execution, or\r\ndownfall of a Royalist.\r\n\r\n      WHAT _Booker_ doth prognosticate\r\n      Concerning kings’ or kingdoms’ fate?\r\n      I think myself to be as wise\r\n      As he that gazeth on the skies;\r\n   My skill goes beyond the depth of a _Pond_,\r\n      Or _Rivers_ in the greatest rain,\r\n   Thereby I can tell all things will be well\r\n      When the King enjoys his own again.\r\n\r\n      There’s neither _Swallow_, _Dove_, nor _Dade_,\r\n      Can soar more high, or deeper wade,\r\n      Nor show a reason from the stars\r\n      What causeth peace or civil wars;\r\n   The Man in the Moon may wear out his shoon\r\n      By running after Charles his wain:\r\n   But all’s to no end, for the times will not mend\r\n      Till the King enjoys his own again.\r\n\r\n      Though for a time we see Whitehall\r\n      With cobwebs hanging on the wall\r\n      Instead of silk and silver brave,\r\n      Which formerly it used to have,\r\n   With rich perfume in every room,—\r\n      Delightful to that princely train,\r\n   Which again you shall see, when the time it shall be,\r\n      That the King enjoys his own again.\r\n\r\n      Full forty years the royal crown\r\n      Hath been his father’s and his own;\r\n      And is there any one but he\r\n      That in the same should sharer be?\r\n   For who better may the sceptre sway\r\n      Than he that hath such right to reign?\r\n   Then let’s hope for a peace, for the wars will not cease\r\n      Till the King enjoys his own again.\r\n\r\n      [Did _Walker_ no predictions lack\r\n      In Hammond’s bloody almanack?\r\n      Foretelling things that would ensue,\r\n      That all proves right, if lies be true;\r\n   But why should not he the pillory foresee,\r\n      Wherein poor Toby once was ta’en?\r\n   And also foreknow to the gallows he must go\r\n      When the King enjoys his own again?] {1}\r\n\r\n      Till then upon Ararat’s hill\r\n      My hope shall cast her anchor still,\r\n      Until I see some peaceful dove\r\n      Bring home the branch I dearly love;\r\n   Then will I wait till the waters abate\r\n      Which now disturb my troubled brain,\r\n   Else never rejoice till I hear the voice\r\n      That the King enjoys his own again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN THE KING COMES HOME IN PEACE AGAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a broadside in the Roxburghe Collection of Ballads.  It appears to\r\nhave been written shortly after Martin Parker’s original ballad obtained\r\npopularity among the Royalists, and to be by another hand.

Brome, Gent.  Published London 1664;\r\nwritten 1645.\r\n\r\n   I LOVE my King and country well,\r\n         Religion and the laws;\r\n   Which I’m mad at the heart that e’er we did sell\r\n         To buy the good old cause.\r\n            These unnatural wars\r\n            And brotherly jars\r\n         Are no delight or joy to me;\r\n            But it is my desire\r\n            That the wars should expire,\r\n         And the King and his realms agree.\r\n\r\n   I never yet did take up arms,\r\n         And yet I dare to dye;\r\n   But I’ll not be seduced by phanatical charms\r\n         Till I know a reason why.\r\n            Why the King and the state\r\n            Should fall to debate\r\n         I ne’er could yet a reason see,\r\n            But I find many one\r\n            Why the wars should be done,\r\n         And the King and his realms agree.\r\n\r\n   I love the King and the Parliament,\r\n         But I love them both together:\r\n   And when they by division asunder are rent,\r\n         I know ’tis good for neither.\r\n            Whichsoe’er of those\r\n            Be victorious,\r\n         I’m sure for us no good ’twill be,\r\n            For our plagues will increase\r\n            Unless we have peace,\r\n         And the King and his realms agree.\r\n\r\n   The King without them can’t long stand,\r\n         Nor they without the King;\r\n   ’Tis they must advise, and ’tis he must command,\r\n         For their power from his must spring.\r\n            ’Tis a comfortless sway\r\n            When none will obey;\r\n         If the King han’t his right, which way shall we?\r\n            They may vote and make laws,\r\n            But no good they will cause\r\n         Till the King and his realm agree.\r\n\r\n   A pure religion I would have,\r\n         Not mixt with human wit;\r\n   And I cannot endure that each ignorant knave\r\n         Should dare to meddle with it.\r\n            The tricks of the law\r\n            I would fain withdraw,\r\n         That it may be alike to each degree:\r\n            And I fain would have such\r\n            As do meddle so much,\r\n         With the King and the church agree.\r\n\r\n   We have pray’d and pray’d that the wars might cease,\r\n         And we be free men made;\r\n   I would fight, if my fighting would bring any peace,\r\n         But war is become a trade.\r\n            Our servants did ride\r\n            With swords by their side,\r\n         And made their masters footmen be;\r\n            But we’ll be no more slaves\r\n            To the beggars and knaves\r\n         Now the King and the realms do agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMONERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n             Written in 1645 to the Club-men, by Alex.

In his first series he printed a Scottish\r\nsong beginning,—\r\n\r\n   “Then was a man came fron the moon\r\n      And landed in our town, sir,\r\n   And he has sworn a solemn oath\r\n      That all but knaves must down, sir.”\r\n\r\nIn Martin Parker’s foregoing ballad, “When the King enjoys his own\r\nagain,” there is also an allusion to the man in the moon:—\r\n\r\n      “The Man in the Moon\r\n      May wear out his shoon\r\n   By running after Charles his wain;”\r\n\r\nas it would appear that the “Man in the Moon,” was the title assumed by\r\nan almanack-maker of the time of the Commonwealth, who, like other\r\nastronomers and astrologers, predicted the King’s restoration.  In this\r\nsong the “Man o’ the Moon” clearly signifies King Charles.\r\n\r\n   The man o’ the moon for ever!\r\n   The man o’ the moon for ever!\r\n      We’ll drink to him still\r\n      In a merry cup of ale,—\r\n   Here’s the man o’ the moon for ever!\r\n\r\n   The man o’ the moon, here’s to him!\r\n   How few there be that know him!\r\n      But we’ll drink to him still\r\n      In a merry cup of ale,—\r\n   The man o’ the moon, here’s to him!\r\n\r\n   Brave man o’ the moon, we hail thee,\r\n   The true heart ne’er shall fail thee;\r\n      For the day that’s gone\r\n      And the day that’s our own—\r\n   Brave man o’ the moon, we hail thee.\r\n\r\n   We have seen the bear bestride thee,\r\n   And the clouds of winter hide thee,\r\n      But the moon is changed\r\n      And here we are ranged,—\r\n   Brave man o’ the moon, we bide thee.\r\n\r\n   The man o’ the moon for ever!\r\n   The man o’ the moon for ever!\r\n      We’ll drink to him still\r\n      In a merry cup of ale,—\r\n   Here’s the man o’ the moon for ever!\r\n\r\n   We have grieved the land should shun thee,\r\n   And have never ceased to mourn thee,\r\n      But for all our grief\r\n      There was no relief,—\r\n   Now, man o’ the moon, return thee.\r\n\r\n   There’s Orion with his golden belt,\r\n   And Mars, that burning mover,\r\n      But of all the lights\r\n      That rule the nights,\r\n   The man o’ the moon for ever!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TUB-PREACHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  By Samuel Butler (Author of Hudibras).\r\n            To the tune of “The Old Courtier of the Queen’s.”\r\n\r\n   WITH face and fashion to be known,\r\n   With eyes all white, and many a groan,\r\n   With neck awry and snivelling tone,\r\n   And handkerchief from nose new-blown,\r\n   And loving cant to sister Joan;\r\n      ’Tis a new teacher about the town,\r\n      Oh! the town’s new teacher!\r\n\r\n   With cozening laugh, and hollow cheek,\r\n   To get new gatherings every week,\r\n   With paltry sense as man can speak,\r\n   With some small Hebrew, and no Greek,\r\n   With hums and haws when stuff’s to seek;\r\n      ’Tis a new teacher, etc.\r\n\r\n   With hair cut shorter than the brow,\r\n   With little band, as you know how,\r\n   With cloak like Paul, no coat I trow,\r\n   With surplice none, nor girdle now,\r\n   With hands to thump, nor knees to bow;\r\n      ’Tis a new teacher, etc.\r\n\r\n   With shop-board breeding and intrusion,\r\n   By some outlandish institution,\r\n   With Calvin’s method and conclusion,\r\n   To bring all things into confusion,\r\n   And far-stretched sighs for mere illusion;\r\n      ’Tis a new teacher, etc.\r\n\r\n   With threats of absolute damnation,\r\n   But certainty of some salvation\r\n   To his new sect, not every nation,\r\n   With election and reprobation,\r\n   And with some use of consolation;\r\n      ’Tis a new teacher, etc.\r\n\r\n   With troops expecting him at door\r\n   To hear a sermon and no more,\r\n   And women follow him good store,\r\n   And with great Bibles to turn o’er,\r\n   Whilst Tom writes notes, as bar-boys score,\r\n      ’Tis a new teacher, etc.\r\n\r\n   With double cap to put his head in,\r\n   That looks like a black pot tipp’d with tin;\r\n   While with antic gestures he doth gape and grin;\r\n   The sisters admire, and he wheedles them in,\r\n   Who to cheat their husbands think no sin;\r\n      ’Tis a new teacher, etc.\r\n\r\n   With great pretended spiritual motions,\r\n   And many fine whimsical notions,\r\n   With blind zeal and large devotions,\r\n   With broaching rebellion and raising commotions,\r\n   And poisoning the people with Geneva potions;\r\n      ’Tis a new teacher, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW LITANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the King’s pamphlets, British Museum.  Satires in the form of a\r\nlitany were common from 1646 to 1746, and even later.\r\n\r\n   FROM an extempore prayer and a godly ditty,\r\n   From the churlish government of a city,\r\n   From the

   And their defendants,\r\n   Both Presbyterians\r\n      And Independents.\r\n\r\nMr Walter Wilkins, in his Political Ballads of the Seventeenth and\r\nEighteenth Centuries, says, the imprint of this broadside intimates that\r\nit was published in “the year of Hope, 1647,” and Thomson, the collector,\r\nadded the precise date, the 7th of September.\r\n\r\n   THAT thou wilt be pleased to grant our requests,\r\n   And quite destroy all the vipers’ nests,\r\n   That England and her true religion molests,\r\n                  Te rogamus audi nos.\r\n\r\n   That thou wilt be pleased to censure

pleased to look on the grief\r\n   Of the King’s old servants, and send them relief,\r\n   Restore to the yeomen o’ th’ Guard chines of beef,\r\n                  Te rogamus, etc.\r\n\r\n   That thou

  That our hopeful Prince and our gracious Queen\r\n   (Whom we here in England long time have not seen)\r\n   May soon be restored to what they have been,\r\n                  Te rogamus,

etc.\r\n\r\n   That our ancient Liturgy may be restored,\r\n   That the organs (by sectaries so much abhorr’d)\r\n   May sound divine praises, according to the word,\r\n                  Te rogamus, etc.\r\n\r\n   That the ring in marriage, the cross at the font,\r\n   Which the devil and the Roundheads so much affront,\r\n   May be used again, as before they were wont,\r\n                  Te rogamus, etc.\r\n\r\n   That Episcopacy, used in its right kind,\r\n   In England once more entertainment may find,\r\n   That Scots and lewd factions may go down the wind,\r\n                  Te rogamus, etc.\r\n\r\n   That thou wilt be pleased again to restore\r\n   All things in due order, as they were before,\r\n   That the Church and the State may be vex’d no more,\r\n                  Te rogamus, etc.\r\n\r\n   That all the King’s friends may enjoy their estates,\r\n   And not be kept, as they have been, at low rates,\r\n   That the poor may find comfort again at their gates,\r\n

honour their natural life,\r\n                  Te rogamus, etc.\r\n\r\n   That they who have seized on honest men’s treasure,\r\n   Only for their loyalty to God and to Cæsar,\r\n   May in time

It is also to be found in the\r\nadditional MSS., No. 11, 608, p. 54, in the collection in the British\r\nMuseum.  It was sung to the air of Love lies bleeding,—and was, says Mr\r\nChappell, “the God save the King” of Charles I., Charles II., and James\r\nII.\r\n\r\n   WHAT though the zealots pull down the prelates,\r\n   Push at the pulpit, and kick at the crown,\r\n   Shall we not never once more endeavour,\r\n   Strive to purchase our royall renown?\r\n   Shall not the Roundhead first be confounded?\r\n   Sa, sa, sa, say, boys, ha, ha, ha, ha, boys,\r\n   Then we’ll return with triumph and joy.\r\n   Then we’ll be merry, drink white wine and sherry,\r\n   Then we will sing, boys, God bless the King, boys,\r\n   Cast up our caps, and cry, _Vive le Roy_.\r\n\r\n   What though the wise make Alderman Isaac\r\n   Put us in prison and steal our estates,\r\n   Though we be forced to be unhorsed,\r\n   And walk on foot as it pleaseth the fates;\r\n   In the King’s army no man shall harm ye.\r\n   Then come along, boys, valiant and strong, boys,\r\n   Fight for your goods, which the Roundheads enjoy;\r\n   And when you venture London to enter,\r\n   And when you come, boys, with fife and drum, boys,\r\n   Isaac himself shall cry, _Vive le Roy_.\r\n\r\n   If you will choose them, do not refuse them,\r\n   Since honest Parliament never made thieves,\r\n   Charles will not further have rogues dipt in murder,\r\n   Neither by leases, long lives, nor reprieves.\r\n   ’Tis the conditions and propositions\r\n   Will not be granted, then be not daunted,\r\n   We will our honest old customs enjoy;\r\n   Paul’s not rejected, will be respected,\r\n   And in the quier voices rise higher,\r\n   Thanks to the heavens, and (cry), _Vive le Roy_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAVALIER.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Samuel Butler.

A somewhat different\r\nversion appears in Chappell’s Popular Music of the Olden Time.\r\n\r\n   HE that is a clear\r\n               Cavalier\r\n   Will not repine,\r\n               Although\r\n   His pocket grow\r\n               So very low\r\n   He cannot get wine.\r\n\r\n   Fortune is a lass\r\n               Will embrace,\r\n   But soon destroy;\r\n               Born free,\r\n   In liberty\r\n               We’ll always be,\r\n   Singing _Vive le Roy_.\r\n\r\n   Virtue is its own reward,\r\n      And Fortune is a whore;\r\n   There’s none but knaves and fools regard her,\r\n      Or her power implore.\r\n   But he that is a trusty _Roger_,\r\n      And will serve the King;\r\n   Altho’ he be a tatter’d soldier,\r\n      Yet may skip and sing:\r\n   Whilst we that fight for love,\r\n   May in the way of honour prove\r\n   That they who make sport of us\r\n   May come short of us;\r\n   Fate will flatter them,\r\n   And will scatter them;\r\n   Whilst our loyalty\r\n   Looks upon royalty,\r\n   We that live peacefully,\r\n   May be successfully\r\n   Crown’d with a crown at last.\r\n\r\n   Tho’ a real honest man\r\n   May be quite undone,\r\n   He’ll show his allegiance,\r\n   Love, and obedience;\r\n   Those will raise him up,\r\n   Honour stays him up,\r\n   Virtue keeps him up,\r\n   And we praise him up.\r\n   Whilst the vain courtiers dine,\r\n   With their bottles full of wine,\r\n   Honour will make him fast.\r\n   Freely then\r\n   Let’s be honest men\r\n      And kick at fate,\r\n   For we may live to see\r\n   Our loyalty\r\n      Valued at a higher rate.\r\n   He that bears a sword\r\n      Or a word against the throne,\r\n   And does profanely prate\r\n   To abuse the state,\r\n      Hath no kindness for his own.\r\n\r\n   What tho’ painted plumes and prayers\r\n      Are the prosp’rous men,\r\n   Yet we’ll attend our own affairs\r\n      ’Till they come to ’t agen;\r\n   Treachery may be faced with light,\r\n      And letchery lined with furr;\r\n   A cuckold may be made a knight,\r\n      Sing _Fortune de la Guerre_.\r\n   But what’s that to us, brave boys,\r\n   That are right honest men?\r\n   We’ll conquer and come again,\r\n   Beat up the drum again;\r\n         Hey for _Cavaliers_,\r\n         Hoe for _Cavaliers_,\r\n         Drink for _Cavaliers_,\r\n         Fight for _Cavaliers_,\r\n         Dub-a-dub, dub-a-dub,\r\n         Have at Old _Beelzebub_,\r\n         _Oliver_ stinks for fear.\r\n\r\n   _Fifth Monarchy-men_ must down, boys,\r\n   With bulleys of every sect in town, boys;\r\n   We’ll rally and to ’t again,\r\n   Give ’em the rout again;\r\n   Fly like light about,\r\n   Face to the right-about,\r\n   Charge them home again\r\n   When they come on again;\r\n   _Sing Tantara rara_, _boys_,\r\n   _Tantara rara_, _boys_,\r\n   This is the life of an Old Cavalier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CAVEAT TO THE ROUNDHEADS.\r\n\r\n\r\n               From the Posthumous Works of Samuel Butler.\r\n\r\n         I COME to charge ye\r\n         That fight the clergy,\r\n   And pull the mitre from the prelate’s head,\r\n         That you will be wary\r\n         Lest you miscarry\r\n   In all those factious humours you have bred;\r\n   But as for _Brownists_ we’ll have none,\r\n   But take them all and hang them one by one.\r\n\r\n         Your wicked actions\r\n         Join’d in factions\r\n   Are all but aims to rob the King of his due;\r\n         Then give this reason\r\n         For your treason,\r\n   That you’ll be ruled, if he’ll be ruled by you.\r\n   Then leave these factions, zealous brother,\r\n   Lest you be hanged one against another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEY, THEN, UP GO WE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis song, says Mr Chappell, in his Popular Music of the Olden Time,\r\nwhich describes with some humour the taste of the Puritans, might pass\r\nfor a Puritan song, if it were not contained in the “Shepherds’ Oracles,”\r\nby Francis Quarles, 1646.  He was cup-bearer to Elizabeth, Queen of\r\nBohemia, daughter of James I., and afterwards chronologer to the city of\r\nLondon.  He died in 1644, and his Shepherds’ Oracles were a posthumous\r\npublication.  It was often reprinted during the Restoration, and\r\nreproduced and slightly altered by Thomas Durfey, in his “Pills to Purge\r\nMelancholy,” where the burthen is, “Hey, boys, up go we.”\r\n\r\n   KNOW this, my brethren, heaven is clear,\r\n      And all the clouds are gone;\r\n   The righteous man shall flourish now,\r\n      Good days are coming on.\r\n   Then come, my brethren, and be glad,\r\n      And eke rejoyce with me;\r\n   Lawn sleeves and rochets shall go down,\r\n      And hey, then, up go we.\r\n\r\n   We’ll break the windows which the whore\r\n      Of Babylon hath painted,\r\n   And when the popish saints are down\r\n      Then Barrow shall be sainted;\r\n   There’s neither cross nor crucifix\r\n      Shall stand for men to see,\r\n   Rome’s trash and trumpery shall go down,\r\n      And hey, then, up go we.\r\n\r\n   Whate’er the Popish hands have built\r\n      Our hammers shall undo;\r\n   We’ll break their pipes and burn their copes,\r\n      And pull down churches too;\r\n   We’ll exercise within the groves,\r\n      And teach beneath a tree;\r\n   We’ll make a pulpit of a cask,\r\n      And hey, then, up go we.\r\n\r\n   We’ll put down Universities,\r\n      Where learning is profest,\r\n   Because they practise and maintain\r\n      The language of the Beast;\r\n   We’ll drive the doctors out of doors,\r\n      And all that learned be;\r\n   We’ll cry all arts and learning down,\r\n      And hey, then, up go we.\r\n\r\n   We’ll down with deans and prebends, too,\r\n      And I rejoyce to tell ye\r\n   We then shall get our fill of pig,\r\n      And capons for the belly.\r\n   We’ll burn the Fathers’ weighty tomes,\r\n      And make the School-men flee;\r\n   We’ll down with all that smells of wit,\r\n      And hey, then, up go we.\r\n\r\n   If once the Antichristian crew\r\n      Be crush’d and overthrown,\r\n   We’ll teach the nobles how to stoop,\r\n      And keep the gentry down:\r\n   Good manners have an ill report,\r\n      And turn to pride, we see,\r\n   We’ll therefore put good manners down,\r\n      And hey, then, up go we.\r\n\r\n   The name of lords shall be abhorr’d,\r\n      For every man’s a brother;\r\n   No reason why in Church and State\r\n      One man should rule another;\r\n   But when the change of government\r\n      Shall set our fingers free,\r\n   We’ll make these wanton sisters stoop,\r\n      And hey, then, up go we.\r\n\r\n   What though the King and Parliament\r\n      Do not accord together,\r\n   We have more cause to be content,\r\n      This is our sunshine weather:\r\n   For if that reason should take place,\r\n      And they should once agree,\r\n   Who would be in a Roundhead’s case,\r\n      For hey, then, up go we.\r\n\r\n   What should we do, then, in this case?\r\n      Let’s put it to a venture;\r\n   If that we hold out seven years’ space\r\n      We’ll sue out our indenture.\r\n   A time may come to make us rue,\r\n      And time may set us free,\r\n   Except the gallows claim his due,\r\n      And hey, then, up go we.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLEAN CONTRARY WAY,\r\nOR,\r\nCOLONEL VENNE’S ENCOURAGEMENT TO HIS SOLDIERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   To the air of “Hey, then, up go we.”\r\n  From a Collection of Loyal Songs written against the Rump Parliament.\r\n\r\n   FIGHT on, brave soldiers, for the cause,\r\n      Fear not the Cavaliers;\r\n   Their threat’nings are as senseless as\r\n      Our jealousies and fears.\r\n   Tis you must perfect this great work,\r\n      And all malignants slay;\r\n   You must bring back the King again\r\n      The clean contrary way.\r\n\r\n   ’Tis for religion that you fight,\r\n      And for the kingdom’s good;\r\n   By robbing churches, plundering them,\r\n      And shedding guiltless blood.\r\n   Down with the orthodoxal train,\r\n      All loyal subjects slay;\r\n   When these are gone, we shall be blest\r\n      The clean contrary way.\r\n\r\n   When _Charles_ we have made bankrupt,\r\n      Of power and crown bereft him,\r\n   And all his loyal subjects slain,\r\n      And none but rebels left him;\r\n   When we have beggar’d all the land,\r\n      And sent our trunks away,\r\n   We’ll make him then a glorious prince\r\n      The clean contrary way.\r\n\r\n   ’Tis to preserve his Majesty\r\n      That we against him fight,\r\n   Nor ever are we beaten back,\r\n      Because our cause is right:\r\n   If any make a scruple at\r\n      Our Declarations, say,—\r\n   Who fight for us, fight for the King\r\n      The clean contrary way.\r\n\r\n   At _Keinton_, _Brainsford_, _Plymouth_, _York_,\r\n      And divers places more,\r\n   What victories we saints obtain,\r\n      The like ne’er seen before:\r\n   How often we Prince _Rupert_ kill’d,\r\n      And bravely won the day,\r\n   The wicked Cavaliers did run\r\n      The clean contrary way.\r\n\r\n   The true religion we maintain,\r\n      The kingdom’s peace and plenty;\r\n   The privilege of Parliament\r\n      Not known to one and twenty;\r\n   The ancient fundamental laws,\r\n      And teach men to obey\r\n   Their lawful sovereign, and all these\r\n      The clean contrary way.\r\n\r\n   We subjects’ liberties preserve\r\n      By imprisonment and plunder,\r\n   And do enrich ourselves and state\r\n      By keeping th’ wicked under.\r\n   We must preserve mechanicks now\r\n      To lectorize and pray;\r\n   By them the gospel is advanced\r\n      The clean contrary way.\r\n\r\n   And though the King be much misled\r\n      By that malignant crew,\r\n   He’ll find us honest at the last,\r\n      Give all of us our due.\r\n   For we do wisely plot, and plot\r\n      Rebellion to alloy,\r\n   He sees we stand for peace and truth\r\n      The clean contrary way.\r\n\r\n   The publick faith shall save our souls\r\n      And our good works together;\r\n   And ships shall save our lives, that stay\r\n      Only for wind and weather:\r\n   But when our faith and works fall down\r\n      And all our hopes decay,\r\n   Our acts will bear us up to heaven\r\n      The clean contrary way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAMERONIAN CAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nA well-known song from Hogg’s Jacobite Relics; and popular among the\r\nCavaliers both of England and Scotland in the days of the Commonwealth.\r\nIt was usually sung to a psalm tune; the singers imitating the style and\r\nmanner of a precentor at a Presbyterian church.\r\n\r\n   THERE was a Cameronian cat\r\n      Was hunting for a prey,\r\n   And in the house she catch’d a mouse\r\n      Upon the Sabbath-day.\r\n\r\n   The Whig, being offended\r\n      At such an act profane,\r\n   Laid by his book, the cat he took,\r\n      And bound her in a chain.\r\n\r\n   Thou damn’d, thou cursed creature,\r\n      This deed so dark with thee,\r\n   Think’st thou to bring to hell below\r\n      My holy wife and me?\r\n\r\n   Assure thyself that for the deed\r\n      Thou blood for blood shalt pay,\r\n   For killing of the Lord’s own mouse\r\n      Upon the Sabbath-day.\r\n\r\n   The presbyter laid by the book,\r\n      And earnestly he pray’d\r\n   That the great sin the cat had done\r\n      Might not on him be laid.\r\n\r\n   And straight to execution\r\n      Poor pussy she was drawn,\r\n   And high hang’d up upon a tree—\r\n      The preacher sung a psalm.\r\n\r\n   And when the work was ended,\r\n      They thought the cat near dead,\r\n   She gave a paw, and then a mew,\r\n      And stretched out her head.\r\n\r\n   Thy name, said he, shall certainly\r\n      A beacon still remain,\r\n   A terror unto evil ones\r\n      For evermore, Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL FEAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Loyall Song of the Royall Feast kept by the Prisoners in the Towre,\r\nAugust last, with the Names, Titles, and Characters of every Prisoner.\r\nBy Sir F. W., Knight and Baronet, Prisoner.  (Sept. 16th, 1647.)\r\n\r\n“In the negotiations between the King and the Parliament during the\r\nsummer and autumn of this year,” says Mr Thomas Wright in his Political\r\nBallads of the Commonwealth, published for the Percy Society, “the case\r\nof the royalist prisoners in the Tower was frequently brought into\r\nquestion.  The latter seized the occasion of complaining against the\r\nrigours (complaints apparently exaggerated) which were exerted against\r\nthem, and on the 16th June, 1647, was published ‘A True Relation of the\r\ncruell and unparallel’d Oppression which hath been illegally imposed upon\r\nthe Gentlemen Prisoners in the Tower of London.’  The several petitions\r\ncontained in this tract have the signatures of Francis Howard, Henry\r\nBedingfield, Walter Blount, Giles Strangwaies, Francis Butler, Henry\r\nVaughan, Thomas Lunsford, Richard Gibson, Tho. Violet, John Morley,\r\nFrancis Wortley, Edw. Bishop, John Hewet, Wingfield Bodenham, Henry\r\nWarren, W. Morton, John Slaughter, Gilbert Swinhow.”\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of August (according to the MODERATE INTELLIGENCER of that\r\ndate) the King sent to the royal prisoners in the Tower two fat bucks for\r\na feast.  This circumstance was the origin of the present ballad.  It was\r\nwritten by Sir Francis Wortley, one of the prisoners.  This ballad, as we\r\nlearn by the concluding lines, was to be sung to the popular tune of\r\n“Chevy Chace.”\r\n\r\n   GOD save the best of kings, King Charles!\r\n      The best of queens, Queen Mary!\r\n   The ladies all, Gloster and Yorke,\r\n      Prince Charles, so like old harry! {5}\r\n\r\n   God send the King his own again,\r\n      His towre and all his coyners!\r\n   And blesse all kings who are to reigne,\r\n      From traytors and purloyners!\r\n      The King sent us poor traytors here\r\n         (But you may guesse the reason)\r\n      Two brace of bucks to mend the cheere,\r\n         Is’t not to eat them treason?\r\n\r\n   Let Selden search Cotton’s records,\r\n      And Rowley in the Towre,\r\n   They cannot match the president,\r\n      It is not in their power.\r\n   Old Collet would have joy’d to ’ve seen\r\n      This president recorded;\r\n   For all the papers he ere saw\r\n      Scarce such an one afforded.\r\n            The King sent us, etc.\r\n\r\n   But that you may these traytors know,\r\n      I’ll be so bold to name them;\r\n   That if they ever traytors prove\r\n      Then this record may shame them:\r\n   But these are well-try’d loyal blades\r\n      (If England ere had any),\r\n   Search both the Houses through and through\r\n      You’ld scarcely finde so many.\r\n            The King sent us, etc.\r\n\r\n   The first and chiefe a marquesse {6} is,\r\n      Long with the State did wrestle;\r\n   Had Ogle {7} done as much as he,\r\n      Th’ad spoyl’d Will Waller’s castle.\r\n   Ogle had wealth and title got,\r\n      So layd down his commissions;\r\n   The noble marquesse would not yield,\r\n      But scorn’d all base conditions.\r\n            The King sent us, etc.\r\n\r\n   The next a worthy bishop {8} is,\r\n      Of schismaticks was hated;\r\n   But I the cause could never know,\r\n      Nor see the reason stated.\r\n   The cryes were loud, God knowes the cause,\r\n      They had a strange committee,\r\n   Which was a-foot well neere a yeare,\r\n      Who would have had small pitty.\r\n            The King sent us, etc.\r\n\r\n   The next to him is a Welsh Judge, {9}\r\n      Durst tell them what was treason;\r\n   Old honest David durst be good\r\n      When it was out of season;\r\n   He durst discover all the tricks\r\n      The lawyers use, and knavery,\r\n   And show the subtile plots they use\r\n      To enthrall us into slavery.\r\n            The King sent us, etc.\r\n\r\n   Frank Wortley {10} hath a jovial soule,\r\n      Yet never was good club-man;\r\n   He’s for the bishops and the church,\r\n      But can endure no tub-man.\r\n   He told Sir Thomas in the Towre,\r\n      Though he by him was undone,\r\n   It pleased him that he lost more men\r\n      In taking him then London.\r\n            The King sent us, etc.\r\n\r\n   Sir Edward Hayles {11} was wond’rous rich,\r\n      No flower in Kent yields honey\r\n   In more abundance to the bee\r\n      Then they from him suck money;\r\n   Yet hee’s as chearfull as the best—\r\n      Judge Jenkins sees no reason\r\n   That honest men for wealth should be\r\n      Accused of high treason.\r\n            The King sent us, etc.\r\n\r\n   Old Sir George Strangways {12} he came in,\r\n      Though he himself submitted,\r\n   Yet as a traytor he must be\r\n      Excepted and committed:\r\n   Yet they th’ exception now take off,\r\n      But not the sequestrations,\r\n   Hee must forsooth to Goldsmith’s-hall,\r\n      The place of desolation.\r\n            The King sent us, etc.\r\n\r\n   Honest Sir Berr’s a reall man,\r\n      As ere was lapt in leather;\r\n   But he (God blesse us) loves the King,\r\n      And therefore was sent hither.\r\n   He durst be sheriff, and durst make\r\n      The Parliament acquainted\r\n   What he intended for to doe,\r\n      And for this was attainted.\r\n            The King sent us, etc.\r\n\r\n   Sir Benefield, {13} Sir Walter Blunt,\r\n      Are Romishly affected,\r\n   So’s honest Frank of Howard’s race,\r\n      And slaughter is suspected. {14}\r\n   But how the devill comes this about,\r\n      That Papists are so loyall,\r\n   And those that call themselves God’s saints\r\n      Like devils do destroy all?\r\n            The King sent us, etc.\r\n\r\n   Jack Hewet {15} will have wholesome meat,\r\n      And drink good wine, if any;\r\n   His entertainment’s free and neat,\r\n      His choyce of friends not many;\r\n   Jack is a loyall-hearted man,\r\n      Well parted and a scholar;\r\n   He’ll grumble if things please him not,\r\n      But never grows to choller.\r\n            The King sent us, etc.\r\n\r\n   Gallant Sir Thomas, {16} bold and stout\r\n      (Brave Lunsford), children eateth;\r\n   But he takes care, where he eats one,\r\n      There he a hundred getteth;\r\n   When Harlow’s wife brings her long bills,\r\n      He wishes she were blinded;\r\n   When shee speaks loud, as loud he swears\r\n      The woman’s earthly-minded.\r\n            The King sent us, etc.\r\n\r\n   Sir Lewis {17} hath an able pen,\r\n      Can cudgell a committee;\r\n   He makes them doe him reason, though\r\n      They others do not pitty.\r\n   Brave Cleaveland had a willing minde,\r\n      Frank Wortley was not able,\r\n   But Lewis got foure pound per weeke\r\n      For’s children and his table.\r\n            The King sent us, etc.\r\n\r\n   Giles Strangwayes {18} has a gallant soul,\r\n      A brain infatigable;\r\n   What study he ere undertakes\r\n      To master it hee’s able:\r\n   He studies on his theoremes,\r\n      And logarithmes for number;\r\n   He loves to speake of Lewis Dives, {19}\r\n      And they are ne’er asunder.\r\n            The King sent us, etc.\r\n\r\n   Sir John Marlow’s

In the latter end of September, after the army had marched to\r\nLondon, and the Parliament acted under its influence, the lord mayor and\r\na large part of the aldermen were committed to the Tower on the charge of\r\nhigh treason; and a new mayor for the rest of the year was appointed by\r\nthe Parliament.\r\n\r\n        To the tune of “London is a fine town and a gallant city.”\r\n\r\n   WHY kept your train-bands such a stirre?\r\n      Why sent you them by clusters?\r\n   Then went into Saint James’s Parke?\r\n      Why took you then their musters?\r\n   Why rode my Lord up Fleet-street\r\n      With coaches at least twenty,\r\n   And fill’d they say with aldermen,\r\n      As good they had been empty?\r\n   London is a brave towne,\r\n      Yet I their cases pitty;\r\n   Their mayor and some few aldermen\r\n      Have cleane undone the city.\r\n\r\n   The ’prentices are gallant blades,\r\n      And to the king are clifty;\r\n   But the lord mayor and aldermen\r\n      Are scarce so wise as thrifty.\r\n   I’le pay for the apprentices,\r\n      They to the King were hearty;\r\n   For they have done all that they can\r\n      To advance their soveraignes party.\r\n            London, etc.\r\n\r\n   What’s now become of your brave Poyntz?\r\n      And of your Generall Massey? {29}\r\n   If you petition for a peace,\r\n      These gallants they will slash yee.\r\n   Where now are your reformadoes?\r\n      To Scotland gone together:\r\n   ’Twere better they were fairly trusst\r\n      Then they should bring them thither.\r\n            London, etc.\r\n\r\n   But if your aldermen were false,\r\n      Or Glyn, that’s your recorder! {30}\r\n   Let them never betray you more,\r\n      But hang them up in order.\r\n   All these men may be coach’t as well\r\n      As any other sinner\r\n   Up Holborne, and ride forwarde still,\r\n      To Tyburne to their dinner.\r\n            London, &c.\r\n\r\n   God send the valiant General may\r\n      Restore the King to glory! {31}\r\n   Then that name I have honour’d so\r\n      Will famous be in story;\r\n   While if he doe not, I much feare\r\n      The ruine of the nation,\r\n   And (that I should be loth to see)\r\n      His house’s desolation.\r\n            London, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAWYERS’ LAMENTATION FOR THE LOSS OF CHARING-CROSS.\r\n\r\n\r\n             From a Collection of Loyal Songs, 1610 to 1660.\r\n\r\n   UNDONE! undone! the lawyers cry,\r\n      They ramble up and down;\r\n   We know not the way to _Westminster_\r\n      Now _Charing-Cross_ is down.\r\n   Now fare thee well, old Charing-Cross,\r\n      Then fare thee well, old stump;\r\n   It was a thing set up by a King,\r\n      And so pull’d down by the _Rump_.\r\n\r\n   And when they came to the bottom of the Strand\r\n      They were all at a loss:\r\n   This is not the way to _Westminster_,\r\n      We must go by _Charing-Cross_.\r\n         Then fare thee well, etc.\r\n\r\n   The Parliament did vote it down\r\n      As a thing they thought most fitting,\r\n   For fear it should fall, and so kill ’em all\r\n      In the House as they were sitting.\r\n         Then fare thee well, etc.\r\n\r\n   Some letters about this _Cross_ were found,\r\n      Or else it might been freed;\r\n   But I dare say, and safely swear,\r\n      It could neither write nor read.\r\n         Then fare thee well, etc.\r\n\r\n   The _Whigs_ they do affirm and say\r\n      To _Popery_ it was bent;\r\n   For what I know it might be so,\r\n      For to church it never went,\r\n         Then fare thee well, etc.\r\n\r\n   This cursed _Rump-Rebellious Crew_,\r\n      They were so damn’d hard-hearted;\r\n   They pass’d a vote that _Charing-Cross_\r\n      Should be taken down and carted:\r\n         Then fare thee well, etc.\r\n\r\n   Now, _Whigs_, I would advise you all,\r\n      ’Tis what I’d have you do;\r\n   For fear the King should come again,\r\n      Pray pull down _Tyburn_ too.\r\n         Then fare thee well, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOWNFAL OF CHARING-CROSS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharing-Cross, as it stood before the civil wars, was one of those\r\nbeautiful Gothic obelisks, erected to conjugal affection by Edward I.,\r\nwho built such a one wherever the hearse of his beloved Eleanor rested in\r\nits way from Lincolnshire to Westminster.  But neither its ornamental\r\nsituation, the beauty of its structure, nor the noble design of its\r\nerection (which did honour to humanity), could preserve it from the\r\nmerciless zeal of the times; for in 1647 it was demolished by order of\r\nthe House of Commons, as Popish and superstitious.  This occasioned the\r\nfollowing not unhumorous sarcasm, which has been often printed among the\r\npopular sonnets of those times.\r\n\r\nThe plot referred to in ver. 3 was that entered into by Mr Waller the\r\npoet, and others, with a view to reduce the city and Tower to the service\r\nof the King; for which two of them, Nath. Tomkins and Richard Chaloner,\r\nsuffered death, July 5, 1643.  Vid. Ath. Ox. 11. 24.—_Percy’s Reliques of\r\nAncient English Poetry_.\r\n\r\n   UNDONE! undone! the lawyers are,\r\n      They wander about the towne,\r\n   Nor can find the way to Westminster\r\n      Now Charing-Cross is downe:\r\n   At the end of the Strand they make a stand,\r\n      Swearing they are at a loss,\r\n   And chaffing say, that’s not the way,\r\n      They must go by Charing-Cross.\r\n\r\n   The Parliament to vote it down\r\n      Conceived it very fitting,\r\n   For fear it should fall, and kill them all\r\n      In the House as they were sitting.\r\n   They were told god-wot, it had a plot,\r\n      Which made them so hard-hearted,\r\n   To give command it should not stand,\r\n      But be taken down and carted.\r\n\r\n   Men talk of plots, this might have been worse,\r\n      For anything I know,\r\n   Than that _Tomkins_ and _Chaloner_\r\n      Were hang’d for long agoe.\r\n   Our Parliament did that prevent,\r\n      And wisely them defended,\r\n   For plots they will discover still\r\n      Before they were intended.\r\n\r\n   But neither man, woman, nor child\r\n      Will say, I’m confident,\r\n   They ever heard it speak one word\r\n      Against the Parliament.\r\n   An informer swore it letters bore,\r\n      Or else it had been freed;\r\n   In troth I’ll take my Bible oath\r\n      It could neither write nor read.\r\n\r\n   The Committee said that verify\r\n      To Popery it was bent:\r\n   For ought I know, it might be so,\r\n      For to church it never went.\r\n   What with excise, and such device,\r\n      The kingdom doth begin\r\n   To think you’ll leave them ne’er a cross\r\n      Without doors nor within.\r\n\r\n   Methinks the Common-council should\r\n      Of it have taken pity,\r\n   ’Cause, good old cross, it always stood\r\n      So firmly to the city.\r\n   Since crosses you so much disdain,\r\n      Faith, if I were as you,\r\n   For fear the King should rule again\r\n      I’d pull down Tiburn too.\r\n\r\nWhitlocke says, “May 3rd, 1643, Cheapside Cross and other crosses were\r\nvoted down,” &c.  When this vote was put in execution does not appear;\r\nprobably not till many mouths after Tomkins and Chaloner had suffered.\r\n\r\nWe had a very curious account of the pulling down of Cheapside Cross\r\nlately published in one of the Numbers of the _Gentlemen’s Magazine_,\r\n1766.—_Percy’s Reliques_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LONG PARLIAMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            By John

Ormond, Montrose, the Danes;\r\n   You, aided by our brethren Scots,\r\n   Defeated have malignant plots,\r\n      And brought your sword to Cain’s.\r\n\r\n   What wholesome laws you have ordain’d,\r\n   Whereby our property’s maintain’d,\r\n      ’Gainst those would us undo;\r\n   So that our fortunes and our lives,\r\n   Nay, what is dearer, our own wives,\r\n      Are wholly kept by you.\r\n\r\n   Oh! what a flourishing Church and State\r\n   Have we enjoy’d e’er since you sate,\r\n      With a glorious King (God save him!):\r\n   Have you not made his Majesty,\r\n   Had he the grace but to comply,\r\n      And do as you would have him!\r\n\r\n   Your _Directory_ how to pray\r\n   By the spirit shows the perfect way;\r\n      In real you have abolisht\r\n   The Dagon of the _Common Prayer_,\r\n   And next we see you will take care\r\n      That churches be demolisht.\r\n\r\n   A multitude in every trade\r\n   Of painful preachers you have made,\r\n      Learned by revelation;\r\n   Cambridge and Oxford made poor preachers,\r\n   Each shop affordeth better teachers,—\r\n      O blessed reformation!\r\n\r\n   Your godly wisdom hath found out\r\n   The true religion, without doubt;\r\n      For sure among so many\r\n   We have five hundred at the least;\r\n   Is not the gospel much increast?\r\n      All must be pure, if any.\r\n\r\n   Could you have done more piously\r\n   Than sell church lands the King to buy,\r\n      And stop the city’s plaints?\r\n   Paying the Scots church-militant,\r\n   That the new gospel helpt to plant;\r\n      God knows they are poor saints!\r\n\r\n   Because th’ Apostles’ Creed is lame,\r\n   Th’ Assembly doth a better frame,\r\n      Which saves us all with ease;\r\n   Provided still we have the grace\r\n   To believe th’ House in the first place,\r\n      Our works be what they please.\r\n\r\n   ’Tis strange your power and holiness\r\n   Can’t the Irish devils dispossess,\r\n      His end is very

hate,\r\n   And counts their calling reprobate,\r\n      ’Cause by the Pope propounded;\r\n   And thinks a zealous cobbler better\r\n   Than learned Usher in ev’ry letter?\r\n      Oh! such a rogue’s a Roundhead.\r\n\r\n   What’s he that doth _high treason_ say,\r\n   As often as his _yea_ and _nay_,\r\n      And wish the King confounded;\r\n   And dares maintain that Mr Pim\r\n   Is fitter for a crown than him?\r\n      Oh! such a rogue’s a Roundhead.\r\n\r\n   What’s he that if he chance to hear\r\n   A little piece of _Common Prayer_,\r\n      Doth think his conscience wounded;\r\n   Will go five miles to preach and pray,\r\n   And meet a sister by the way?\r\n      Oh! such a rogue’s a Roundhead.\r\n\r\n   What’s he that met a holy sister\r\n   And in a haycock gently kiss’d her?\r\n      Oh! then his zeal abounded:\r\n   ’Twas underneath a shady willow,\r\n   Her Bible served her for a pillow,\r\n      And there he got a Roundhead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRATTLE YOUR PLEASURE UNDER THE ROSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                From the King’s Pamphlets, British Museum.\r\n\r\n   THERE is an old proverb which all the world knows,\r\n   Anything may be spoke, if ’t be under the rose:\r\n   Then now let us speak, whilst we are in the hint,\r\n   Of the state of the land, and th’ enormities in’t.\r\n\r\n   Under the rose be it spoke, there is a number of knaves,\r\n   More than ever were known in a State before;\r\n   But I hope that their mischiefs have digg’d their own graves,\r\n   And we’ll never trust knaves for their sakes any more.\r\n\r\n   Under the rose be it spoken, the city’s an ass\r\n   So long to the public to let their gold run,\r\n   To keep the King out; but ’tis now come to pass,\r\n   I am sure they will lose, whosoever has won.\r\n\r\n   Under the rose be it spoken, there’s a company of men,\r\n   Trainbands they are called—a plague confound ’em:—\r\n   And when they are waiting at Westminster Hall,\r\n   May their wives be beguiled and begat with child all!\r\n\r\n   Under the rose be it spoken, there’s a damn’d committee\r\n   Sits in hell (Goldsmiths’ Hall), in the midst of the city,\r\n   Only to sequester the poor Cavaliers—\r\n   The devil take their souls, and the hangman their ears.\r\n\r\n   Under the rose be it spoken, if you do not repent\r\n   Of that horrible sin, your pure Parliament,\r\n   Pray stay till Sir Thomas doth bring in the King,\r\n   Then Derrick {32} may chance have ’em all in a string.\r\n\r\n   Under the rose be it spoken, let the synod now leave\r\n   To wrest the whole Scripture, how souls to deceive;\r\n   For all they have spoken or taught will ne’er save ’em,\r\n   Unless they will leave that fault, hell’s sure to have ’em!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOMINION OF THE SWORD.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      A song made in the Rebellion.\r\n\r\n                      From the Loyal Garland, 1686.\r\n                  To the tune of “Love lies a bleeding.”\r\n\r\n      LAY by your pleading,\r\n      Law lies a bleeding;\r\n   Burn all your studies down, and\r\n      Throw away your reading.\r\n\r\n      Small pow’r the word has,\r\n      And can afford us\r\n   Not half so much privilege as\r\n      The sword does.\r\n\r\n      It fosters your masters,\r\n      It plaisters disasters,\r\n   It makes the servants quickly greater\r\n      Than their masters.\r\n\r\n      It venters, it enters,\r\n      It seeks and it centers,\r\n   It makes a’prentice free in spite\r\n      Of his indentures.\r\n\r\n      It talks of small things,\r\n      But it sets up all things;\r\n   This masters money, though money\r\n      Masters all things.\r\n\r\n      It is not season\r\n      To talk of reason,\r\n   Nor call it loyalty, when the sword\r\n      Will have it treason.\r\n\r\n      It conquers the crown, too,\r\n      The grave and the gown, too,\r\n   First it sets up a presbyter, and\r\n      Then it pulls him down too.\r\n\r\n      This subtle disaster\r\n      Turns bonnet to beaver;\r\n   Down goes a bishop, sirs, and up\r\n      Starts a weaver.\r\n\r\n      This makes a layman\r\n      To preach and to pray, man;\r\n   And makes a lord of him that\r\n      Was but a drayman.\r\n\r\n      Far from the gulpit\r\n      Of Saxby’s pulpit,\r\n   This brought an Hebrew ironmonger\r\n      To the pulpit.\r\n\r\n      Such pitiful things be\r\n      More happy than kings be;\r\n   They get the upper hand of Thimblebee\r\n      And Slingsbee.\r\n\r\n      No gospel can guide it,\r\n      No law can decide it,\r\n   In Church or State, till the sword\r\n      Has sanctified it.\r\n\r\n      Down goes your law-tricks,\r\n      Far from the matricks,\r\n   Sprung up holy Hewson’s power,\r\n      And pull’d down St Patrick’s.\r\n\r\n      This sword it prevails, too,\r\n      So highly in Wales, too,\r\n   Shenkin ap Powel swears\r\n      “Cots-splutterer nails, too.”\r\n\r\n      In Scotland this faster\r\n      Did make such disaster,\r\n   That they sent their money back\r\n      For which they sold their master.\r\n\r\n      It batter’d their Gunkirk,\r\n      And so it did their Spainkirk,\r\n   That he is fled, and swears the devil\r\n      Is in Dunkirk.\r\n\r\n      He that can tower,\r\n      Or he that is lower,\r\n   Would be judged a fool to put\r\n      Away his power.\r\n\r\n      Take books and rent ’em,\r\n      Who can invent ’em,\r\n   When that the sword replies,\r\n      _Negatur argumentum_.\r\n\r\n      Your brave college-butlers\r\n      Must stoop to the sutlers;\r\n   There’s ne’er a library\r\n      Like to the cutlers’.\r\n\r\n      The blood that was spilt, sir,\r\n      Hath gain’d all the gilt, sir;\r\n   Thus have you seen me run my\r\n      Sword up to the hilt, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE’S NEW COIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coinage issued during the Protectorate of Cromwell, consisted of\r\npieces having on the obverse side a shield with St George’s cross,\r\nencircled by a laurel and palm branch, and the words, “The Commonwealth\r\nof England.”  On the reverse side was the legend, “God with us,” and two\r\nshields, bearing the arms of England and Ireland.\r\n\r\n   SAW you the State’s money new come from the Mint?\r\n      Some people do say it is wonderous fine;\r\n   And that you may read a great mystery in’t,\r\n      Of mighty King Nol, the lord of the coin.\r\n\r\n   They have quite omitted his politic head,\r\n      His worshipful face, and his excellent nose;\r\n   But the better to show the life he had led,\r\n      They have fix’d upon it the print of his hose.\r\n\r\n   For, if they had set up his picture there,\r\n      They needs must ha’ crown’d him in Charles’s stead;\r\n   But ’twas cunningly done, that they did forbear,\r\n      And rather would set up aught else than his head.\r\n\r\n   ’Tis monstrous strange, and yet it is true,\r\n      In this reformation we should have such luck;\r\n   That crosses were always disdain’d by you,\r\n      Who before pull’d them down, should now set them up.\r\n\r\n   On this side they have circumscribed “God with us,”\r\n      And in this stamp and coin they confide;\r\n   _Common-Wealth_ on the other, by which we may guess\r\n      That God and the States were not both of a side.\r\n\r\n   On this side they have cross and harp,\r\n      And only a cross on the other set forth;\r\n   By which we may learn, it falls to our part\r\n      Two crosses to have for one fit of mirth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANARCHIE, OR THE BLEST REFORMATION SINCE 1640.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing a new song, wherein the people expresse their thankes and pray for\r\nthe reformers.\r\n\r\nTo be said or sung of all the well-affected of the kingdome of England,\r\nand dominion of Wales, before the breaking up of this unhappy Parliament.\r\n\r\n[From the King’s Pamphlets, British Museum.  It is printed but\r\nincorrectly in the “Rump Songs,” ed. 1665, under the title of “The\r\nRebellion.”]\r\n\r\n                           To a rare new Tune.\r\n                             (Oct. 24, 1648.)\r\n\r\n   NOW that, thankes to the powers below!\r\n      We have e’ne done out our doe,\r\n   The mitre is downe, and so is the crowne,\r\n      And with them the coronet too;\r\n   Come clownes, and come boyes, come hober-de-hoyes,\r\n      Come females of each degree;\r\n   Stretch your throats, bring in your votes,\r\n      And make good the anarchy.\r\n   And “thus it shall goe,” sayes Alice;\r\n      “Nay, thus it shall goe,” sayes Amy;\r\n   “Nay, thus it shall goe,” sayes Taffie, “I trow;”\r\n      “Nay, thus it shall goe,” sayes Jamy.\r\n\r\n   Ah! but the truth, good people all,\r\n      The truth is such a thing;\r\n   For it wou’d undoe both Church and State too,\r\n      And cut the throat of our King.\r\n   Yet not the spirit, nor the new light,\r\n      Can make this point so cleare,\r\n   But thou must bring out, thou deified rout,\r\n      What thing this truth is, and where.\r\n   Speak Abraham, speak Kester, speak Judith, speak Hester,\r\n      Speak tag and rag, short coat and long;\r\n   Truth’s the spell made us rebell,\r\n      And murther and plunder, ding-dong.\r\n   “Sure I have the truth,” sayes Numph;\r\n      “Nay, I ha’ the truth,” sayes Clemme;\r\n   “Nay, I ha’ the truth,” sayes Reverend Ruth;\r\n      “Nay, I ha’ the truth,” sayes Nem.\r\n\r\n   Well, let the truth be where it will,\r\n      We’re sure all else is ours;\r\n   Yet these divisions in our religions\r\n      May chance abate our powers.\r\n   Then let’s agree on some one way,\r\n      It skills not much how true;\r\n   Take Pryn and his clubs; or Say and his tubs, {33}\r\n      Or any sect old or new;\r\n   The devil’s i’ th’ pack, if choyce you can lack,\r\n      We’re fourscore religions strong;\r\n   Take your choyce, the major voyce\r\n      Shall carry it, right or wrong.\r\n   “Then wee’le be of this,” sayes Megg;\r\n      “Nay, wee’le be of that,” sayes Tibb;\r\n   “Nay, wee’le be of all,” sayes pitifull Paul;\r\n      “Nay, wee’le be of none,” sayes Gibb.\r\n\r\n   Neighbours and friends, pray one word more,\r\n      There’s something yet behinde;\r\n   And wise though you be, you doe not well see\r\n      In which doore sits the winde.\r\n   As for religion to speake right,\r\n      And in the Houses sence,\r\n   The matter’s all one to have any or none,\r\n      If ’twere not for the pretence.\r\n   But herein doth lurke the key of the worke,\r\n      Even to dispose of the crowne,\r\n   Dexteriously, and as may be,\r\n      For your behoofe and your owne.\r\n   “Then let’s ha’ King Charles,” sayes George;\r\n      “Nay, let’s have his son,” sayes Hugh;\r\n   “Nay, let’s have none,” sayes Jabbering Jone;\r\n      “Nay, let’s be all kings,” sayes Prue.\r\n\r\n   Oh we shall have (if we go on\r\n      In plunder, excise, and blood)\r\n   But few folke and poore to domineere ore,\r\n      And that will not be so good;\r\n   Then let’s resolve on some new way,\r\n      Some new and happy course,\r\n   The country’s growne sad, the city horne-mad,\r\n      And both the Houses are worse.\r\n   The synod hath writ, the generall hath spit,\r\n      And both to like purposes too;\r\n   Religion, lawes, the truth, the cause,\r\n      Are talk’t of, but nothing we doe.\r\n   “Come, come, shal’s ha’ peace?” sayes Nell;\r\n      “No, no, but we won’t,” sayes Madge;\r\n   “But I say we will,” sayes firy-faced Phill;\r\n      “We will and we won’t,” sayes Hodge.\r\n\r\n   Thus from the rout who can expect\r\n      Ought but division?\r\n   Since unity doth with monarchy\r\n      Begin and end in one.\r\n   If then when all is thought their owne,\r\n      And lyes at their behest,\r\n   These popular pates reap nought but debates,\r\n      From that many round-headed beast;\r\n   Come, Royalists, then, doe you play the men,\r\n      And Cavaliers give the word;\r\n   Now let us see at what you would be,\r\n      And whether you can accord.\r\n   “A health to King Charles!” sayes Tom;\r\n      “Up with it,” sayes Ralph, like a man;\r\n   “God blesse him,” sayes Doll; “and raise him,” sayes Moll;\r\n      “And send him his owne!” sayes Nan.\r\n\r\n   Now for these prudent things that sit\r\n      Without end and to none,\r\n   And their committees, that townes and cities\r\n      Fill with confusion;\r\n   For the bold troopes of sectaries,\r\n      The Scots and their partakers,\r\n   Our new British states, Col.

The King was beheaded in January, 1649.  This Ballad is dated the\r\n23rd of April in the same year.\r\n\r\n                         CROMWELL ON THE THRONE.\r\n\r\n   SO, so, the deed is done,\r\n      The royal head is sever’d,\r\n   As I meant when I first begun,\r\n      And strongly have endeavour’d.\r\n   Now Charles the First is tumbled down,\r\n      The Second I do not fear;\r\n   I grasp the sceptre, wear the crown,\r\n      Nor for Jehovah care.\r\n\r\n                       KING CHARLES IN HIS COFFIN.\r\n\r\n   Think’st thou, base slave, though in my grave\r\n      Like other men I lie,\r\n   My sparkling fame and royal name\r\n      Can (as thou wishest) die?\r\n   Know, caitif, in my son I live\r\n      (The Black Prince call’d by some),\r\n   And he shall ample vengeance give\r\n      To those that did my doom.\r\n\r\n                          THE PEOPLE IN THE PIT.\r\n\r\n   Supprest, deprest, involved in woes,\r\n      Great Charles, thy people be\r\n   Basely deceived with specious shows\r\n      By those that murther’d thee.\r\n   We are enslaved to tyrants’ hests,\r\n      Who have our freedom won:\r\n   Our fainting hope now only rests\r\n      On thy succeeding son.\r\n\r\n                         CROMWELL ON THE THRONE.\r\n\r\n   Base vulgar! know, the more you stir,\r\n      The more your woes increase,\r\n   Your rashness will your hopes deter,\r\n      ’Tis we must give you peace.\r\n   Black Charles a traitor is proclaim’d\r\n      Unto our dignity;\r\n   He dies (if e’er by us he’s gain’d)\r\n      Without all remedy.\r\n\r\n                       KING CHARLES IN HIS COFFIN.\r\n\r\n   Thrice perjured villain! didst not thou\r\n      And thy degenerate train,\r\n   By mankind’s Saviour’s body vow\r\n      To me thy sovereign,\r\n   To make me the most glorious king\r\n      That e’er o’er England reign’d;\r\n   That me and mine in everything\r\n      By you should be maintain’d?\r\n\r\n                          THE PEOPLE IN THE PIT.\r\n\r\n   Sweet prince!

STUFF.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinted in “Percy’s Reliques,” from an old black-letter copy in Mr Pepys’\r\ncollection, corrected by two others, one of which is preserved in a\r\nChoice Collection of 120 Loyal Songs—1684\r\n\r\n                 To the tune of “Old Sir Simon the King.”\r\n\r\n   REBELLION hath broken up house,\r\n      And hath left me old lumber to sell;\r\n   Come hither and take your choice,\r\n      I’ll promise to use you well.\r\n   Will you buy the old Speaker’s chair?\r\n      Which was warm and easy to sit in,\r\n   And oft has been clean’d, I declare,\r\n      Whereas it was fouler than fitting.\r\n         Says old Simon the King,\r\n         Says old Simon the King,\r\n   With his ale-dropt hose, and his Malmsey nose,\r\n         Sing, hey ding, ding-a-ding, ding.\r\n\r\n   Will you buy any bacon flitches,\r\n      The fattest that ever were spent?\r\n   They’re the sides of the old committees\r\n      Fed up in the Long Parliament.\r\n   Here’s a pair of bellows and tongs,\r\n      And for a small matter I’ll sell ye ’um,\r\n   They are made of the presbyter’s lungs,\r\n      To blow up the coals of rebellion.\r\n         Says old Simon, etc.\r\n\r\n   I had thought to have given them once\r\n      To some blacksmith for his forge;\r\n   But now I have consider’d on’t,\r\n      They are consecrate to the Church:\r\n   So I’ll give them unto some quire,\r\n      They will make the big organs roar,\r\n   And the little pipes to squeak higher\r\n      Than ever they could before.\r\n         Says old Simon, etc.\r\n\r\n   Here’s a couple of stools for sale,\r\n      One’s square, and t’other is round;\r\n   Betwixt them both, the tail\r\n      Of the Rump fell down to the ground.\r\n   Will you buy the State’s council-table,\r\n      Which was made of the good wain-Scot?\r\n   The frame was a tottering Babel,\r\n      To uphold th’ Independent plot.\r\n         Says old Simon, etc.\r\n\r\n   Here’s the besom of Reformation,\r\n      Which should have made clean the floor;\r\n   But it swept the wealth out of the nation,\r\n      And left us dirt good store.\r\n   Will you buy the state’s spinning-wheel,\r\n      Which spun for the roper’s trade?\r\n   But better it had stood still,\r\n      For now it has spun a fair thread.\r\n         Says old Simon, etc.\r\n\r\n   Here’s a glyster-pipe well tried,\r\n      Which was made of a butcher’s stump,\r\n   And has been safely applied\r\n      To cure the colds of the Rump.\r\n   Here’s a lump of pilgrim’s-salve,\r\n      Which once was a justice of peace,\r\n   Who Noll and the devil did serve,\r\n      But now it is come to this,\r\n         Says old Simon, etc.\r\n\r\n   Here’s a roll of the State’s tobacco,\r\n      If any good fellow will take it;\r\n   No Virginia had e’er such a Smack-o,\r\n      And I’ll tell you how they did make it:\r\n   ’Tis th’ Engagement and Covenant cook’t\r\n      Up with the abjuration oath,\r\n   And many of them that have took’t\r\n      Complain it was foul in the mouth.\r\n         Says old Simon, etc.\r\n\r\n   Yet the ashes may happily serve\r\n      To cure the scab of the nation,\r\n   Whene’er’t has an itch to swerve\r\n      To rebellion by innovation.\r\n   A lanthorn here is to be bought,\r\n      The like was scarce ever gotten,\r\n   For many plots it has found out\r\n      Before they ever were thought on.\r\n         Says old Simon, etc.\r\n\r\n   Will you buy the Rump’s great saddle,\r\n      With which it jockey’d the nation?\r\n   And here is the bit and the bridle,\r\n      And curb of dissimulation;\r\n   And here’s the trunk-hose of the Rump,\r\n      And their fair dissembling cloak;\r\n   And a Presbyterian jump,\r\n      With an Independent smock.\r\n         Says old Simon, etc.\r\n\r\n   Will you buy a conscience oft turn’d,\r\n      Which served the High-Court of justice,\r\n   And stretch’d until England it mourn’d,\r\n      But hell will buy that if the worst is.\r\n   Here’s Joan Cromwell’s kitchen-stuff tub,\r\n      Wherein is the fat of the Rumpers,\r\n   With which old Noll’s horns she did rub,\r\n      When he was got drunk with false bumbers.\r\n         Says old Simon, etc.\r\n\r\n   Here’s the purse of the public faith;\r\n      Here’s the model of the Sequestration,\r\n   When the old wives upon their good troth\r\n      Lent thimbles to ruin the nation.\r\n   Here’s Dick Cromwell’s Protectorship,\r\n      And here are Lambert’s commissions,\r\n   And here is Hugh Peters his scrip,\r\n      Cramm’d with tumultuous petitions.\r\n         Says old Simon, etc.\r\n\r\n   And here are old Noll’s brewing vessels,\r\n      And here are his dray and his flings;\r\n   Here are Hewson’s {36} awl and his bristles,\r\n      With diverse other odd things:\r\n   And what is the price doth belong\r\n      To all these matters before ye?\r\n   I’ll sell them all for an old song,\r\n      And so I do end my story.\r\n         Says old Simon, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAVALIER’S FAREWELL TO HIS MISTRESS, BEING CALLED TO THE WARRS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following song was extracted from the MS.

the King of Scots\r\nattending on this supposed gentlewoman in manner of a serving-man.\r\n\r\n               Tune, “When the King enjoys his own again.”\r\n\r\n   ALL you that do desire to know\r\n      What is become of the King o’ Scots,\r\n   I unto you will truly show\r\n      After the fight of Northern Rats.\r\n            ’Twas I did convey\r\n            His Highness away,\r\n   And from all dangers set him free;—\r\n            In woman attire,\r\n            As reason did require,\r\n   And the King himself did wait on me.\r\n\r\n   He of me a service did crave,\r\n      And oftentimes to me stood bare;\r\n   In woman’s apparel he was most brave,\r\n      And on his chin he had no hare;\r\n            Wherever I came\r\n            My speeches did frame\r\n   So well my waiting-man to free,\r\n            The like was never known\r\n            I think by any I one,\r\n   For the King himself did wait on me.\r\n\r\n   My waiting-man a jewel had,\r\n      Which I for want of money sold;\r\n   Because my fortune was so bad\r\n      We turn’d our jewel into gold.\r\n            A good shift indeed,\r\n            In time of our need,\r\n   Then glad was I and glad was he;\r\n            Our cause it did advance\r\n            Until we came to France,\r\n   And the King himself did wait on me.\r\n\r\n   We walked through Westminster Hall,\r\n      Where law and justice doth take place\r\n   Our grief was great, our comfort small,\r\n      We lookt grim death all in the face.\r\n            I lookt round about,\r\n            And made no other doubt\r\n   But I and my man should taken be;\r\n            The people little knew,\r\n            As I may tell to you,\r\n   The King himself did wait on me.\r\n\r\n   From thence we went to the fatal place\r\n      Where his father lost his life;\r\n   And then my man did weep apace,\r\n      And sorrow with him then was rife.\r\n            I bid him peace,\r\n            Let sorrow cease,\r\n   For fear that we should taken be.\r\n            The gallants in Whitehall\r\n            Did little know at all\r\n   That the King himself did wait on me.\r\n\r\n   The King he was my serving-man,\r\n      And thus the plot we did contrive:\r\n   I went by the name of Mistress Anne\r\n      When we took water at Queenhythe.\r\n            A boat there we took,\r\n            And London forsook,\r\n   And now in France arrived are we.\r\n            We got away by stealth,\r\n            And the King is in good health,\r\n   And he shall no longer wait on me.\r\n\r\n   The King of Denmark’s dead, they say,\r\n      Then Charles is like to rule the land;\r\n   In France he will no longer stay,\r\n      As I do rightly understand.\r\n            That land is his due,\r\n            If they be but true,\r\n   And he with them do well agree:\r\n            I heard a bird sing\r\n            If he once be their king,\r\n   My man will then my master be.\r\n\r\n   Now Heaven grant them better success\r\n      With their young king than England had;\r\n   Free from war and from distress,\r\n      Their fortune may not be so bad;\r\n            Since the case thus stands,\r\n            Let neighbouring lands\r\n   Lay down their arms and at quiet be;\r\n            But as for my part,\r\n            I am glad with all my heart\r\n   That my King must now my master be.\r\n\r\n   And thus I have declared to you\r\n      By what means we escaped away;\r\n   Now we bid our cares adieu,\r\n      Though the King did lose the day.\r\n            To him I was true,\r\n            And that he well knew;\r\n   ’Tis God that must his comfort be,\r\n            Else all our policy\r\n            Had been but foolery,\r\n   For the King no longer waits on me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG TO THE FIGURE TWO.\r\n\r\n\r\n      From vol. ii. of the Roxburgh Ballads, in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n   A merry new song wherein you may view\r\n   The drinking healths of a joviall crew,\r\n   To t’ happie return of the figure of TWO.\r\n\r\n The figure of TWO is a palpable allusion to Charles II.  Tune, “Ragged,\r\n                           and torn, and true.”\r\n\r\n   I HAVE been a traveller long,\r\n      And seen the conditions of all;\r\n   I see how each other they wrong,\r\n      And the weakest still goes to the wall.\r\n   And here I’ll begin to relate\r\n      The crosse condition of those\r\n   That hinder our happy fate,\r\n      And now are turned our foes.\r\n   Here’s a health to the figure of TWO,\r\n      To the rest of the issue renown’d;\r\n   We’ll bid all our sorrows adieu,\r\n      When the figure of TWO shall be crown’d.\r\n\r\n   I crossed the ocean of late,\r\n      And there I did meet with a crosse,\r\n   But having a pretty estate,\r\n      I never lamented my losse:\r\n   I never lamented my harmes,\r\n      And yet I was wondrous sad;\r\n   I found all the land up in arms,\r\n      And I thought all the folke had bin mad.\r\n         Here’s a health, etc.\r\n\r\n   Kind countrymen, how fell ye out?\r\n      I left you all quiet and still;\r\n   But things are now brought so about,\r\n      You nothing but plunder and kill;\r\n   Some doe seem seemingly holy,\r\n      And would be reformers of men,\r\n   But wisdom doth laugh at their folly,\r\n      And sayes they’ll be children agen,\r\n         Here’s a health, etc.\r\n\r\n   But woe to the figure of One!\r\n      King Solomon telleth us so;\r\n   But he shall be wronged by none\r\n      That hath two strings to his bow.\r\n   How I love this figure of TWO\r\n      Among all the figures that be,\r\n   I’ll make it appear unto you\r\n      If that you will listen to me.\r\n         Here’s a health, etc.\r\n\r\n   Observe when the weather is cold\r\n      I wear a cap on my head,\r\n   But wish, if I may be so bold,\r\n      The figure of TWO in my bed.\r\n   TWO in my bed I do crave,\r\n      And that is myself and my mate;\r\n   But pray do not think I would have\r\n      TWO large great hornes on my pate.\r\n         Here’s a health, etc.\r\n\r\n   Since Nature hath given two hands,\r\n      But when they are foul I might scorn them;\r\n   Yet people thus much understands,\r\n      TWO fine white gloves will adorn them.\r\n   TWO feet for to bear up my body,\r\n      No more had the knight of the sun;\r\n   But people would think me a noddy\r\n      If two shoes I would not put on.\r\n         Here’s a health, etc.\r\n\r\n   The figure of TWO is a thing\r\n      That we cannot well live without,\r\n   No more than without a good king,\r\n      Though we be never so stout;\r\n   And thus we may well understand,\r\n      If ever our troubles should cease,\r\n   Two needful things in a land\r\n      Is a king and a justice of peace.\r\n         Here’s a health, etc.\r\n\r\n   And now for to draw to an end,\r\n      I wish a good happy conclusion,\r\n   The State would so much stand our friend,\r\n      To end this unhappy confusion;\r\n   The which might be done in a trice,\r\n      In giving of Cæsar his due;\r\n   If we were so honest and wise\r\n      As to think of the figure of TWO.\r\n         Here’s a health, etc.\r\n\r\n   If any desire to know,\r\n      This riddle I now will unfold,\r\n   It is a man wrapped in woe,\r\n      Whose father is wrapped in mould:\r\n   So now to conclude my song,\r\n      I mention him so much the rather\r\n   Because he hath suffer’d some wrong,\r\n      And bears up the name of his father.\r\n         Here’s a health, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REFORMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n Written in the year 1652, by Samuel Butler.  From his Posthumous Works.\r\n\r\n   TELL me not of Lords and laws,\r\n      Rules or reformation;\r\n   All that’s done not worth two straws\r\n      To the welfare of the nation;\r\n   If men in power do rant it still,\r\n   And give no reason but their will\r\n      For all their domination;\r\n   Or if they do an act that’s just,\r\n   ’Tis not because they would, but must,\r\n   To gratify some party’s lust.\r\n\r\n   All our expense of blood and purse\r\n      Has yet produced no profit;\r\n   Men are still as bad or worse,\r\n      And will whate’er comes of it.\r\n   We’ve shuffled out and shuffled in\r\n   The person, but retain the sin,\r\n      To make our game the surer;\r\n   Yet spight of all our pains and skill,\r\n   The knaves all in the pack are still,\r\n   And ever were, and ever will,\r\n      Though something now demurer.\r\n\r\n   And it can never be so,\r\n      Since knaves are still in fashion;\r\n   Men of souls so base and low,\r\n      Meer bigots of the nation;\r\n   Whose designs are power and wealth,\r\n   At which by rapine, power, and stealth,\r\n      Audaciously they vent’re ye;\r\n   They lay their consciences aside,\r\n   And turn with every wind and tide,\r\n   Puff’d on by ignorance and pride,\r\n      And all to look like gentry.\r\n\r\n   Crimes are not punish’d ’cause they’re crimes,\r\n      But cause they’re low and little:\r\n   Mean men for mean faults in these times\r\n      Make satisfaction to tittle;\r\n   While those in office and in power\r\n   Boldly the underlings devour,\r\n      Our cobweb laws can’t hold ’em;\r\n   They sell for many a thousand crown\r\n   Things which were never yet their own,\r\n   And this is law and custom grown,\r\n      ’Cause those do judge who sold ’em.\r\n\r\n   Brothers still with brothers brawl,\r\n      And for trifles sue ’em;\r\n   For two pronouns that spoil all\r\n      Contentious _meum_ and _tuum_.\r\n   The wary lawyer buys and builds\r\n   While the client sells his fields\r\n      To sacrifice his fury;\r\n   And when he thinks t’ obtain his right,\r\n   He’s baffled off or beaten quite\r\n   By the judge’s will, or lawyer’s slight,\r\n      Or ignorance of the jury.\r\n\r\n   See the tradesman how he thrives\r\n      With perpetual trouble:\r\n   How he cheats and how he strives,\r\n      His estate t’ enlarge and double;\r\n   Extort, oppress, grind and encroach,\r\n   To be a squire and keep a coach,\r\n      And to be one o’ th’ quorum;\r\n   Who may with’s brother-worships sit,\r\n   And judge without law, fear, or wit,\r\n   Poor petty thieves, that nothing get,\r\n      And yet are brought before ’em.\r\n\r\n   And his way to get all this\r\n      Is mere dissimulation;\r\n   No factious lecture does he miss,\r\n      And ’scape no schism that’s in fashion:\r\n   But with short hair and shining shoes,\r\n   He with two pens and note-book goes,\r\n      And winks and writes at random;\r\n   Thence with short meal and tedious grace,\r\n   In a loud tone and public place,\r\n   Sings wisdom’s hymns, that trot and pace\r\n      As if Goliah scann’d ’em.\r\n\r\n   But when Death begins his threats,\r\n      And his conscience struggles\r\n   To call to mind his former cheats,\r\n      Then at Heaven he turns and juggles:\r\n   And out of all’s ill-gotten store\r\n   He gives a dribbling to the poor;\r\n      An hospital or school-house;\r\n   And the suborn’d priest for his hire\r\n   Quite frees him from th’ infernal fire,\r\n   And places him in th’ angel’s quire:\r\n      Thus these Jack-puddings fool us!\r\n\r\n   All he gets by’s pains i’ th’ close,\r\n      Is, that he dy’d worth so much;\r\n   Which he on’s doubtful seed bestows,\r\n      That neither care nor know much:\r\n   Then fortune’s favourite, his heir,\r\n   Bred base and ignorant and bare,\r\n      Is blown up like a bubble:\r\n   Who wondering at’s own sudden rise,\r\n   By pride, simplicity, and vice,\r\n   Falls to his sports, drink, drabs, and dice,\r\n      And make all fly like stubble.\r\n\r\n   And the Church, the other twin,\r\n      Whose mad zeal enraged us,\r\n   Is not purified a pin\r\n      By all those broils in which th’ engaged us:\r\n   We our wives turn’d out of doors,\r\n   And took in concubines and whores,\r\n      To make an alteration;\r\n   Our pulpitors are proud and bold,\r\n   They their own wills and factions hold,\r\n   And sell salvation still for gold,\r\n      And here’s our _reformation_!\r\n\r\n   ’Tis a madness then to make\r\n      Thriving our employment,\r\n   And lucre love for lucre’s sake,\r\n      Since we’ve possession, not enjoyment:\r\n   Let the times run on their course,\r\n   For oppression makes them worse,\r\n      We ne’er shall better find

After\r\nCromwell’s victory at Worcester, he prevailed on the Parliament to pass a\r\ngeneral, or quasi-general, amnesty for all political offences committed\r\nprior to that time.\r\n\r\n   REJOICE, rejoice, ye Cavaliers,\r\n   For here comes that dispels your fears;\r\n   A general pardon is now past,\r\n   What was long look’d for, comes at last.\r\n\r\n   It pardons all that are undone;\r\n   The Pope ne’er granted such a one:\r\n   So long, so large, so full, so free,\r\n   Oh what a glorious State have we!\r\n\r\n   Yet do not joy too much, my friends,\r\n   First see how well this pardon ends;\r\n   For though it hath a glorious face,\r\n   I fear there’s in’t but little grace.\r\n\r\n   ’Tis said the mountains once brought forth,—\r\n   And what brought they? a mouse, in troth;\r\n   Our States have done the like, I doubt,\r\n   In this their pardon now set out.\r\n\r\n   We’ll look it o’er, then, if you please,\r\n   And see wherein it brings us ease:\r\n   And first, it pardons words, I find,\r\n   Against our State—words are but wind.\r\n\r\n   Hath any pray’d for th’ King of late,\r\n   And wish’d confusion to our State?\r\n   And call’d them rebels?  He may come in\r\n   And plead this pardon for that sin.\r\n\r\n   Has any call’d King Charles that’s dead\r\n   A martyr—he that lost his head?\r\n   And villains those that did the fact?\r\n   That man is pardon’d by this Act.\r\n\r\n   Hath any said our Parliament\r\n   I such a one as God ne’er sent?\r\n   Or hath he writ, and put in print,\r\n   That he believes the devil’s in’t?\r\n\r\n   Or hath he said there never were\r\n   Such tyrants anywhere as here?\r\n   Though this offence of his be high,\r\n   He’s pardon’d for his blasphemy.\r\n\r\n   You see how large this pardon is,\r\n   It pardons all our _Mercuries_, {37}\r\n   And poets too, for you know they\r\n   Are poor, and have not aught to pay.\r\n\r\n   For where there’s money to be got,\r\n   I find this pardon pardons not;\r\n   Malignants that were rich before,\r\n   Shall not be pardon’d till they’re poor.\r\n\r\n   Hath any one been true to th’ Crown,\r\n   And for that paid his money down,\r\n   By this new Act he shall be free,\r\n   And pardon’d for his loyalty.\r\n\r\n   Who have their lands confiscate quite,\r\n   For not compounding when they might;\r\n   If that they know not how to dig,\r\n   This pardon gives them leave to beg.\r\n\r\n   Before this Act came out in print,\r\n   We thought there had been comfort in’t;\r\n   We drank some healths to the higher powers,\r\n   But now we’ve seen’t they’d need drink ours.\r\n\r\n   For by this Act it is thought fit\r\n   That no man shall have benefit,\r\n   Unless he first engage to be\r\n   A rebel to eternity.\r\n\r\n   Thus, in this pardon it is clear\r\n   That nothing’s here and nothing’s there:\r\n   I think our States do mean to choke us\r\n   With this new Act of _hocus pocus_.\r\n\r\n   Well, since this Act’s not worth a pin,\r\n   We’ll pray our States to call it in,\r\n   For most men think it ought to be\r\n   Burnt by the hand of Gregory.\r\n\r\n   Then, to conclude, here’s little joy\r\n   For those that pray _Vive le Roy_!\r\n   But since they’ll not forget our crimes,\r\n   We’ll keep our mirth till better times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OLD SONG ON OLIVER’S COURT.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Written in the year 1654, by Samuel Butler.\r\n\r\n   HE that would a new courtier be\r\n   And of the late coyn’d gentry;\r\n   A brother of the prick-eared crew,\r\n   Half a presbyter, half a Jew,\r\n   When he is dipp’d in Jordan’s flood,\r\n   And wash’d his hands in royal blood,\r\n      Let him to our court repair,\r\n      Where all trades and religions are.\r\n\r\n   If he can devoutly pray,\r\n   Feast upon a fasting day,\r\n   Be longer blessing a warm bit\r\n   Than the cook was dressing it;\r\n   With covenants and oaths dispense,\r\n   Betray his lord for forty pence,\r\n      Let him, etc.\r\n\r\n   If he be one of the eating tribe,\r\n   Both a Pharisee and a Scribe,\r\n   And hath learn’d the snivelling tone\r\n   Of a flux’d devotion;\r\n   Cursing from his sweating tub\r\n   The Cavaliers to Beelzebub,\r\n      Let him, etc.\r\n\r\n   Who sickler than the city ruff,\r\n   Can change his brewer’s coat to buff,\r\n   His dray-cart to a coach, the beast\r\n   Into Flanders mares at least;\r\n   Nay, hath the art to murder kings,\r\n   Like David, only with his slings,\r\n      Let him, etc.\r\n\r\n   If he can invert the word,\r\n   Turning his ploughshare to a sword,\r\n   His cassock to a coat of mail;\r\n   ’Gainst bishops and the clergy rail;\r\n   Convert Paul’s church into the mews;\r\n   Make a new colonel of old shoes,\r\n      Let him, etc.\r\n\r\n   Who hath commission to convey\r\n   Both sexes to _Jamaica_,\r\n   There to beget new babes of grace\r\n   On wenches hotter than the place,\r\n   Who carry in their tails a fire\r\n   Will rather scorch than quench desire,\r\n      Let him, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARLIAMENT ROUTED,\r\nOR\r\nHERE’S A HOUSE TO BE LET.\r\n\r\n\r\n   I hope that England, after many jarres,\r\n   Shall be at peace, and give no way to warres:\r\n   O Lord, protect the generall, that he\r\n   May be the agent of our unitie.\r\n\r\nWritten upon the dissolution of the Long Parliament by Cromwell, on the\r\n20th April, 1653, and extracted from the King’s Pamphlets, British\r\nMuseum.

The Rump Parliament, in an\r\nexcess of Puritanic acerbity, had abolished the observance of Christmas,\r\nand forbidden the eating of puddings and pies, as savouring of Popery.\r\n\r\n                        Tune—“I tell thee, Dick.”\r\n\r\n   THIS Christmas time ’tis fit that we\r\n   Should feast, and sing, and merry be.\r\n         It is a time of mirth;\r\n   For never since the world began\r\n   More joyful news was brought to man\r\n         Than at our Saviour’s birth.\r\n\r\n   But such have been these times of late,\r\n   That holidays are out of date,\r\n         And holiness to boot;\r\n   For they that do despise and scorn\r\n   To keep the day that Christ was born,\r\n         Want holiness no doubt.\r\n\r\n   That Parliament that took away\r\n   The observation of that day,\r\n         We know it was not free;\r\n   For if it had, such acts as those\r\n   Had ne’er been seen in verse or prose,\r\n         You may conclude with me.\r\n\r\n   ’Twas that Assembly did maintain\r\n   ’Twas law to kill their sovereign,\r\n         Who by that law must die;\r\n   Though God’s anointed ones are such,\r\n   Which subjects should not dare to touch,\r\n         Much less to crucify.\r\n\r\n   ’Twas that which turn’d our bishops out\r\n   Of house and home, both branch and root,\r\n         And gave no reason why;\r\n   And all our clergy did expel,\r\n   That would not do like that rebel—\r\n         This no man can deny.\r\n\r\n   It was that Parliament that took\r\n   Out of our churches our _Service book_,\r\n         A book without compare;\r\n   And made God’s house (to all our griefs),\r\n   That house of prayer, a den of thiefs’\r\n         Both here and everywhere.\r\n\r\n   They had no head for many years,\r\n   Nor heart (I mean the House of Peers),\r\n         And yet it did not die;\r\n   Of these long since it was bereft,\r\n   And nothing but the tail was left,\r\n         You know as well as I.\r\n\r\n   And in this tail was a tongue,\r\n   Lenthal {42} I mean, whose fame hath rung\r\n         In country and in city;\r\n   Not for his worth or eloquence,\r\n   But for a rebel to his prince,\r\n         And neither wise nor witty.\r\n\r\n   This Speaker’s words must needs be wind,\r\n   Since they proceeded from behind;\r\n         Besides, you way remember,\r\n   From thence no act could be discreet,\r\n   Nor could the sense o’ the House be sweet\r\n         Where Atkins was a member.\r\n\r\n   This tale’s now done, the Speaker’s dumb,\r\n   Thanks to the trumpet and the drum;\r\n         And now I hope to see\r\n   A Parliament that will restore\r\n   All things that were undone before,\r\n         That we may Christians be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FREE PARLIAMENT LITANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n         From the King’s Pamphlets, British Museum.—(A.

Brome.\r\n\r\n      STAY, stay, prate no more,\r\n      Lest thy brain, like thy purse, run the score,\r\n            Though thou strain’st it;\r\n      Those are traitors in grain\r\n      That of sack do complain,\r\n            And rail by its own power against it.\r\n   Those kingdoms and crowns which your poetry pities,\r\n   Are fall’n by the pride and hypocrisy of cities,\r\n   And not by those brains that love sack and good ditties;\r\n   The K. and his progeny had kept them from sinking,\r\n   Had they had no worse foes than the lads that love drinking,\r\n   We that tipple ha’ no leisure for plotting or thinking.\r\n\r\n      He is an ass\r\n      That doth throw down himself with a glass\r\n            Of Canary;\r\n      He that’s quiet will think\r\n      Much the better of drink,\r\n            ’Cause the cups made the camp to miscarry.\r\n   You whore while we tipple, and there, my friend, you lie,\r\n   Your sports did determine in the month of July;\r\n   There’s less fraud in plain damme than your sly by my truly;\r\n   ’Tis sack makes our bloods both purer and warmer,\r\n   We need not your priest or the feminine charmer,\r\n   For a bowl of Canary’s a whole suit of armour.\r\n\r\n      Hold, hold, not so fast,\r\n      Tipple on, for there is no such haste\r\n            To be going;\r\n      We drowning may fear,\r\n      But your end will be there\r\n            Where there is neither swimming nor rowing.\r\n   We were gamesters alike, and our stakes were both down, boys,\r\n   But Fortune did favour you, being her own, boys;\r\n   And who would not venture a cast for a crown, boys?\r\n   Since we wear the right colours, he the worst of our foes is\r\n   That goes to traduce, and fondly supposes\r\n   That Cromwell’s an enemy to sack and red noses.\r\n\r\n      Then, then, quaff it round,\r\n      No deceit in a brimmer is found;\r\n            Here’s no swearing:\r\n      Beer and ale makes you prate\r\n      Of the Church and the State,\r\n            Wanting other discourse worth the hearing.\r\n   This strumpet your muse is, to ballad or flatter,\r\n   Or rail, and your betters with froth to bespatter,\r\n   And your talk’s all dismals and gunpowder matter;\r\n   But we, while old sack does divinely inspire us,\r\n   Are active to do what our rulers require us,\r\n   And attempt such exploits as the world shall admire us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAS CLOSE AS A GOOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Samuel Butler.—(A.D. 1657.)  This ballad ridicules the tender of the\r\nCrown of England to Oliver Cromwell by Alderman Pack, M.P. for London.\r\n\r\n   AS close as a goose\r\n   Sat the Parliament-house,\r\n      To hatch the royal gull;\r\n   After much fiddle-faddle\r\n   The egg proved addle,\r\n      And Oliver came forth _Noll_.\r\n\r\n   Yet old Queen Madge, {43}\r\n   Though things do not fadge,\r\n      Will serve to be queen of a May-pole;\r\n   Two Princes of Wales, {44}\r\n   For Whitsun-ales,\r\n      And her grace, Maid Marion Claypole. {45}\r\n\r\n   In a robe of cow hide\r\n   Sat yeasty Pride, {46}\r\n      With his dagger and his sling;\r\n   He was the pertinenst peer\r\n   Of all that were there,\r\n      T’ advise with such a king.\r\n\r\n   A great philosopher\r\n   Had a goose for his lover\r\n      That follow’d him day and night:\r\n   If it be a true story,\r\n   Or but an allegory,\r\n      It may be both ways right.\r\n\r\n   Strickland {47} and his son,\r\n   Both cast into one,\r\n      Were meant for a single baron;\r\n   But when they came to sit,\r\n   There was not wit\r\n      Enough in them both to serve for one.\r\n\r\n   Wherefore ’twas thought good\r\n   To add Honeywood,\r\n      But when they came to trial\r\n   Each one proved a fool,\r\n   Yet three knaves in the whole,\r\n      And that made up a _pair-royal_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRISONERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Written when O. C. attempted to be King.  By Alex. Brome.\r\n\r\n   COME, a brimmer (my bullies), drink whole ones or nothing,\r\n      Now healths have been voted down;\r\n   ’Tis sack that can heat us, we care not for clothing,\r\n      A gallon’s as warm as a gown;\r\n            ’Cause the Parliament sees\r\n            Nor the former nor these\r\n   Could engage us to drink their health,\r\n            They may vote that we shall\r\n            Drink no healths at all,\r\n   Not to King nor to Commonwealth,\r\n   So that now we must venture to drink ’em by stealth.\r\n\r\n   But we’ve found out a way that’s beyond all their thinking;\r\n      To keep up good fellowship still,\r\n   We’ll drink their destruction that would destroy drinking,—\r\n      Let ’um vote _that_ a health if they will.\r\n            Those men that did fight,\r\n            And did pray day and night\r\n   For the Parliament and its attendant,\r\n            Did make all that bustle\r\n            The King out to justle,\r\n   And bring in the Independent,\r\n   But now we all clearly see what was the end on’t.\r\n\r\n   Now their idols thrown down with their sooter-kin also,\r\n      About which they did make such a pother;\r\n   And tho’ their contrivance did make one thing to fall so,\r\n      We have drank ourselves into another;\r\n            And now (my lads) we\r\n            May still Cavaliers be,\r\n   In spite of the Committee’s frown;\r\n            We will drink and we’ll sing,\r\n            And each health to our King\r\n   Shall be loyally drunk in the ‘_Crown_,’\r\n   Which shall be the standard in every town.\r\n\r\n   Their politick would-be’s do but show themselves asses\r\n      That other men’s calling invade;\r\n   We only converse with pots and with glasses,\r\n      Let the rulers alone with their trade;\r\n            The Lyon of the Tower\r\n            There estates does devour,\r\n   Without showing law for’t or reason;\r\n            Into prison we get\r\n            For the crime called debt,\r\n   Where our bodies and brains we do season,\r\n   And that is ne’er taken for murder or treason.\r\n\r\n   Where our ditties still be, Give’s more drink, give’s more drink,\r\n   boys.\r\n      Let those that are frugal take care;\r\n   Our gaolers and we will live by our chink, boys,\r\n      While our creditors live by the air;\r\n            Here we live at our ease,\r\n            And get craft and grease,\r\n   ’Till we’ve merrily spent all our store;\r\n            Then, as drink brought us in,\r\n            ’Twill redeem us agen;\r\n   We got in because we were poor,\r\n   And swear ourselves out on the very same score.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROTECTING BREWER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was apparently written as a parody on the Brewer, in Pills to purge\r\nMelancholy, 1682.  The original was too complimentary to Oliver Cromwell,\r\nasserted by the Royalists to have been a brewer in early life, to suit\r\nthe taste of the Cavaliers, and hence the alteration made in it.  Such\r\ncompliments as the following must have proceeded from a writer of the\r\nopposite party.\r\n\r\n   Some Christian kings began to quake,\r\n   And said With the brewer no quarrel we’ll make,\r\n   We’ll let him alone; as he brews let him bake;\r\n               Which nobody can deny.\r\n\r\n   He had a strong and a very stout heart,\r\n   And thought to be made an Emperor for’t,\r\n               * * * * *\r\n               Which nobody can deny.\r\n\r\n   A BREWER may be a burgess grave,\r\n   And carry the matter so fine and so brave,\r\n   That he the better may play the knave,\r\n               Which nobody can deny.\r\n\r\n   A brewer may put on a Nabal face,\r\n   And march to the wars with such a grace\r\n   That he may get a captain’s place;\r\n               Which nobody, etc.\r\n\r\n   A brewer may speak so wondrous well\r\n   That he may rise (strange things to tell),\r\n   And so be made a colonel;\r\n               Which nobody, etc.\r\n\r\n   A brewer may make his foes to flee,\r\n   And rise his fortunes, so that he\r\n   Lieutenant-general may be;\r\n               Which nobody, etc.\r\n\r\n   A brewer may be all in all,\r\n   And raise his powers, both great and small,\r\n   That he may be a lord general;\r\n               Which nobody, etc.\r\n\r\n   A brewer may be like a fox in a cub,\r\n   And teach a lecture out of a tub,\r\n   And give the wicked world a rub;\r\n               Which nobody, etc.\r\n\r\n   A brewer, by’s excise and rate,\r\n   Will promise his army he knows what,\r\n   And set upon the college-gate;\r\n               Which nobody, etc.\r\n\r\n   Methinks I hear one say to me,\r\n   Pray why may not a brewer be\r\n   Lord Chancellor o’ the University?\r\n               Which nobody, etc.\r\n\r\n   A brewer may be as bold as Hector,\r\n   When as he had drank his cup o’ Nectar,\r\n   And a brewer may be a Lord Protector;\r\n               Which nobody, etc.\r\n\r\n   Now here remains the strangest thing,\r\n   How this brewer about his liquor did bring\r\n   To be an emperor or a king;\r\n               Which nobody, etc.\r\n\r\n   A brewer may do what he will,\r\n   And rob the Church and State, to sell\r\n   His soul unto the devil in hell;\r\n               Which nobody, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARRAIGNMENT OF THE DEVIL FOR STEALING AWAY PRESIDENT BRADSHAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Bradshaw, who had presided over the court of justice which condemned\r\nCharles I. to the scaffold, and who by his extreme republican principles\r\nhad rendered himself obnoxious to Cromwell, began again to be\r\ndistinguished in public affairs after the Protector’s death, and was\r\nelected President of the Council of State.  He did not live long to enjoy\r\nthis honour, but died, according to some authorities, on the 31st\r\nOctober, 1659.  Chalmers places his death on the 22nd of November in that\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n                 To the tune of “Well-a-day, well-a-day.”\r\n\r\n   IF you’ll hear news that’s ill,\r\n      Gentlemen, gentlemen,\r\n   Against the devil, I will\r\n      Be the relator;\r\n   Arraigned he must be,\r\n   For that feloniously,\r\n   ’Thout due solemnity,\r\n      He took a traitor.\r\n\r\n   John Bradshaw was his name,\r\n      How it stinks! how it stinks!\r\n   Who’ll make with blacker fame\r\n      Pilate unknown.\r\n   This worse than worse of things\r\n   Condemn’d the best of kings,\r\n   And, what more guilt yet brings,\r\n      Knew ’twas his own.\r\n\r\n   Virtue in Charles did seem\r\n      Eagerly, eagerly,\r\n   And villainy in him\r\n      To vye for glory.\r\n   Majesty so compleat\r\n   And impudence so great\r\n   Till that time never met:—\r\n      But to my story.\r\n\r\n   Accusers there will be,\r\n      Bitter ones, bitter ones,\r\n   More than one, two, or three,\r\n      All full of spight;\r\n   Hangman and tree so tall,\r\n   Bridge, tower, and city-wall,\r\n   Kite and crow, which were all\r\n      Robb’d of their right.\r\n\r\n   But judges none are fit,\r\n      Shame it is, shame it is,\r\n   That twice seven years did sit\r\n      To give hemp-string dome;\r\n   The friend they would befriend,\r\n   That he might in the end\r\n   To them like favour lend,\r\n      In his own kingdome.\r\n\r\n   Sword-men, it must be you,\r\n      Boldly to’t, boldly to’t,\r\n   Must give the diver his due;\r\n      Do it not faintly,\r\n   But as you raised by spell\r\n   Last Parliament from hell,\r\n   And it again did quell\r\n      Omnipotently.\r\n\r\n   The charge they wisely frame\r\n      (On with it, on with it)\r\n   In that yet unknown name\r\n      Of supream power;\r\n   While six weeks hence by vote\r\n   Shall be or it shall not,\r\n   When Monk’s to London got {48}\r\n      In a good hour.\r\n\r\n   But twelve good men and true,\r\n      Caveliers, Caveliers,\r\n   He excepts against you;\r\n      Justice he fears.\r\n   From bar and pulpit hee\r\n   Craves such as do for fee\r\n   Serve all turns, for he’l be\r\n      Try’d by his peers.\r\n\r\n   Satan, y’ are guilty found\r\n      By your peers, by your peers,\r\n   And must die above ground!\r\n      Look for no pity;\r\n   Some of our ministry,\r\n   Whose spir’ts with yours comply,\r\n   As Owen, Caryl, Nye, {49}\r\n      For death shall fit ’ee.\r\n\r\n   Dread judges, mine own limb\r\n      I but took, I but took,\r\n   I was forced without him\r\n      To use a crutch;\r\n   Some of the robe can tell\r\n   How to supply full well\r\n   His place here, but in hell\r\n      I had none such.\r\n\r\n   Divel, you are an asse,\r\n      Plain it is, plain it is,\r\n   And weakly plead the case;\r\n      Your wits are lost.\r\n   Some lawyers will outdo’t,\r\n   When shortly they come to’t;\r\n   Your craft, our gold to boot,\r\n      They have ingross’d.\r\n\r\n   Should all men take their right,\r\n      Well-a-day, well-a-day,\r\n   We were in a sad plight,\r\n      O’ th’ holy party!\r\n   Such practise hath a scent\r\n   Of kingly government,\r\n   Against it we are bent,\r\n      Out of home char’ty.\r\n\r\n   But if I die, who am\r\n      King of hell, King of hell,\r\n   You will not quench its flame,\r\n      But find it worse:\r\n   Confused anarchy\r\n   Will a new torment be;\r\n   Ne’r did these kingdoms three\r\n      Feel such a curse.\r\n\r\n   To our promotion, sir,\r\n      There as here, there as here,\r\n   Through some confused stir\r\n      Doth the high-road lie;\r\n   In hell we need not fear\r\n   Nor King nor Cavalier,\r\n   Who then shall dominere\r\n      But we the godly?\r\n\r\n   Truth, then, sirs, which of old\r\n      Was my shame, was my shame,\r\n   Shall now to yours be told:\r\n      You caused his death;\r\n   The house being broken by\r\n   Yourselves (there’s burglary),\r\n   Wrath enter’d forcibly,\r\n      And stopt his breath.\r\n\r\n   Sir, as our president,\r\n      Taught by you, taught by you,\r\n   ’Gainst the King away went\r\n      Most strange and new;\r\n   Charging him with the guilt\r\n   Of all the blond we spilt,\r\n   With swords up to the hilt,\r\n      So we’le serve you.\r\n\r\n   For mercy then I call,\r\n      Good my lords, good my lords,\r\n   And traytors I’le leave all\r\n      Duly to end it;\r\n   Sir, sir, ’tis frivolous,\r\n   As well for you as us,\r\n   To beg for mercy thus,—\r\n      Our crimes transcend it.\r\n\r\n   You must die out of hand,\r\n      Satanas, Satanas:\r\n   This our decree shall stand\r\n      Without controll;\r\n   And we for you will pray,\r\n   Because the Scriptures say,\r\n   When some men curse you, they\r\n      Curse their own soul.\r\n\r\n   The fiend to Tiburn’s gone,\r\n      There to die, there to die;\r\n   Black is the north, anon\r\n      Great storms will be;\r\n   Therefore together now\r\n   I leave him and th’ gallow,—\r\n   So, newes-man, take ’em now,\r\n      Soon they’l take thee.\r\n\r\n                          Finis, Fustis, Funis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW BALLAD TO

Political Ballads of the\r\nCommonwealth, published for the Percy Society, “was written on the\r\noccasion of the overthrow of the Rump by Monck.  He arrived in London on\r\nthe third of February, and professed himself a determined supporter of\r\nthe party then uppermost.  On the ninth and tenth he executed their\r\norders against the city; but suddenly on the eleventh he joined the city\r\nand the Presbyterian party, and demanded the readmission of the members\r\nwho were secluded formerly from the Long Parliament.  This measure put an\r\nend to the reign of the Rump, and immediately afterwards the Parliament\r\ndissolved itself, and a new one was called.—(February 28th, 1659.)”—All\r\nthe notes to this Ballad are from the pen of Mr Wright.\r\n\r\n          To the tune of “The Old Courtier of the Queen’s,” etc.\r\n\r\n   NEWS! news! here’s the occurrences and a new Mercurius,\r\n   A dialogue betwixt Haselrigg the baffled and Arthur the furious;\r\n   With Ireton’s {50} readings upon legitimate and spurious,\r\n   Proving that a saint may be the son of a whore, for the satisfaction\r\n   of the curious.\r\n            From a Rump insatiate as the sea,\r\n            Libera nos, Domine.\r\n\r\n   Here’s the true reason of the citie’s infatuation,\r\n   Ireton has made it drunk with the cup of abomination;\r\n   That is, the cup of the whore, after the Geneva Interpretation,\r\n   Which with the juyce of Titchburn’s grapes {51} must needs cause\r\n   intoxication.\r\n            From a Rump, etc.\r\n\r\n   Here’s the Whipper whipt by a friend to George, that whipp’d Jack,\r\n   {52} that whipp’d the breech,\r\n   That whipp’d the nation as long as it could stand over it—after which\r\n   It was itself re-jerk’d by the sage author of this speech:\r\n   “Methinks a Rump should go as well with a Scotch spur as with a\r\n   switch.”\r\n            From a Rump, etc.\r\n\r\n   This Rump hath many a rotten and unruly member;\r\n   “Give the generall the oath!” cries one (but his conscience being a\r\n   little tender);\r\n   “I’ll abjure you with a pestilence!” quoth George, “and make you\r\n   remember\r\n   The ’leaventh of February {53} longer than the fifth of November!”\r\n            From a Rump, etc.\r\n\r\n   With that, Monk leaves (in Rump assembled) the three estates,\r\n   But oh! how the citizens hugg’d him for breaking down their gates,\r\n   For tearing up their posts and chaynes, and for clapping up their\r\n   mates {54}\r\n   (When they saw that he brought them plasters for their broken pates).\r\n            From a Rump, etc.\r\n\r\n   In truth this ruffle put the town in great disorder,\r\n   Some knaves (in office) smiled, expecting ’twould go furder;\r\n   But at the last, “My life on’t!

“good, my Lord, for the love\r\n   of God!\r\n   Consider yourself, us, and this poor nation, and that tyrant abroad;\r\n   Don’t leave us:”—but George gave him a shrugg instead of a nodd.\r\n            From a Rump, etc.\r\n\r\n   This mortal silence was followed with a most hideous noyse,\r\n   Of free Parliament bells and Rump-confounding boyes,\r\n   Crying, “Cut the rogues! singe their tayles!” when, with a low voyce,\r\n   “Fire and sword! by this light,” cryes Tom, “Lets look to our toyes!”\r\n            From a Rump, etc.\r\n\r\n   Never were wretched members in so sad a plight;\r\n   Some were broyl’d, some toasted, others burnt outright;

The\r\n    officers of the army all forced to yield.  Lawson lies still in the\r\n    river, and Monk is with his army in Scotland.  Only my Lord Lambert\r\n    is not yet come in to the Parliament, nor is it expected that he will\r\n    without being forced to it.  The new Common Council of the city do\r\n    speak very high; and had sent to Monk their sword-bearer to acquaint\r\n    him with their desires for a free and full Parliament, which is at\r\n    present the desires, and the hopes, and the expectations of all.\r\n    Twenty-two of the old secluded members having been at the House-door\r\n    the last week to demand entrance, but it was denied them; and it is\r\n    believed that neither they nor the people will be satisfied till the\r\n    House be filled.”  Pepys’ Diary, January, 1660.\r\n\r\n   YOU may have heard of the politique snout,\r\n   Or a tale of a tub with the bottom out,\r\n   But scarce of a Parliament in a dirty clout,\r\n         Which no body can deny.\r\n\r\n   ’Twas Atkins {68} first served this Rump in with mustard—\r\n   The sauce was a compound of courage and custard;\r\n   Sir Vane bless’d the creature, Noll snuffled and bluster’d,\r\n         Which no body can deny.\r\n\r\n   The right was as then in old Oliver’s nose;\r\n   But when the Devil of that did dispose,\r\n   It descended from thence to the Rump in the close,\r\n         Which no body can deny.\r\n\r\n   Nor is it likely there to stay long,\r\n   The retentive faculties being gone,\r\n   The juggle is stale, and money there’s none,\r\n         Which no body can deny.\r\n\r\n   The secluded members made a trial\r\n   To enter, but them the Rump did defy all\r\n   By the ordinance of self-denial,\r\n         Which no body can deny.\r\n\r\n   Our politique doctors do us teach\r\n   That a blood-sucking red-coat’s as good as a leech\r\n   To relieve the head, if applied to the breech,\r\n         Which no body can deny.\r\n\r\n   But never was such a worm as Vane;\r\n   When the State scour’d last, it voided him then,\r\n   Yet now he’s crept into the Rump again,\r\n         Which no body can deny.\r\n\r\n   Ludlow’s f— was a prophetique trump {69}\r\n   (There never was anything so jump),\r\n   ’Twas the very type of a vote of this Rump,\r\n         Which no body can deny.\r\n\r\n   They say ’tis good luck when a body rises\r\n   With the rump upward, but he that advises\r\n   To live in that posture is none of the wisest,\r\n         Which no body can deny.\r\n\r\n   The reason is worse, though the rime be untoward,\r\n   When things proceed with the wrong end forward;\r\n   But they say there’s sad news to the Rump from the Nor’ward; {70}\r\n         Which no body can deny.\r\n\r\n   ’Tis a wonderfull thing, the strength of that part;\r\n   At a blast it will take you a team from a cart,\r\n   And blow a man’s head away with a f—,\r\n         Which no body can deny.\r\n\r\n   When our brains are sunck below the middle,\r\n   And our consciences steer’d by the hey-down-diddle,\r\n   Then things will go round without a fiddle,\r\n         Which no body can deny.\r\n\r\n   You may order the city with hand-granado,\r\n   Or the generall with a bastonado,—\r\n   But no way for a Rump like a carbonado,\r\n         Which no body can deny.\r\n\r\n   To make us as famous in council as wars,\r\n   Here’s Lenthal a speaker for mine—\r\n   And Fleetwood is a man of Mars,\r\n         Which no body can deny.\r\n\r\n   ’Tis pitty that Nedham’s {71} fall’n into disgrace,\r\n   For he orders a bum with a marvellous grace,\r\n   And ought to attend the Rump by his place,\r\n         Which no body can deny.\r\n\r\n   Yet this in spight of all disasters,\r\n   Although he hath broken the heads of his masters,\r\n   ’Tis still his profession to give ’em all plasters,\r\n         Which no body can deny.\r\n\r\n   The Rump’s an old story, if well understood;\r\n   ’Tis a thing dress’d up in a Parliament’s hood,\r\n   And like ’t, but the tayl stands where the head should,\r\n         Which no body can deny.\r\n\r\n   ’Twould make a man scratch where it does not itch,\r\n   To see forty fools’ heads in one politique breech,\r\n   And that, hugging the nation, as the devil did the witch;\r\n         Which no body can deny.\r\n\r\n   From rotten members preserve our wives!\r\n   From the mercy of a Rump, our estates and our lives!\r\n   For they must needs go whom the Devil drives,\r\n         Which no body can deny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PROPER NEW BALLAD ON THE OLD PARLIAMENT;\r\nOR,\r\nTHE SECOND PART OF KNAVE OUT OF DOORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              To the tune of\r\n\r\n    “Hei ho, my honey, my heart shall never rue,\r\n    Four-and-twenty now for your mony, and yet a hard penny-worth too.”\r\n\r\n      (Dec. 11th, 1659.)—From the King’s Pamphlets, British Museum.\r\n\r\n    “The events which gave occasion to the following ballad,” says Mr T.\r\n    Wright in his Political Ballads, published for the Percy Society,\r\n    “may be summed up in a few words.  After the death of Cromwell, his\r\n    son Richard was without opposition raised to the Protectorate; but\r\n    his weak and easy character gave an opening to the intrigues of the\r\n    Royalists, and the factious movement of the Republican party.\r\n    Fleetwood, who had been named commander-in-chief of the army under\r\n    the Protector, plotted to gain the chief power in the State, and was\r\n    joined by Lambert, Desborough, and others.  The Republicans were\r\n    strengthened by the return of Vane, Ludlow, and Bradshaw, to the\r\n    Parliament called by the new Protector.  Lambert, the Protector’s\r\n    brother-in-law, was the ostensible head of a party, and seems to have\r\n    aimed at obtaining the power which had been held by Oliver.  They\r\n    formed a council of officers, who met at Wallingford House; and on\r\n    the 20th April, 1659, having gained the upper hand, and having\r\n    obtained the dissolution of the Parliament, they determined to\r\n    restore the old Long Parliament, which they said had only been\r\n    interrupted, and not legally dissolved, and to set aside the\r\n    Protector, who soon afterwards resigned.  On the 21st April,\r\n    Lenthall, the old Speaker, with as many members of the Long\r\n    Parliament as could be brought together, met in the House, and opened\r\n    their session.  The Parliament thus formed, as being the fag-end of\r\n    the old Long Parliament, obtained the name of the Rump Parliament.\r\n    Lambert’s hopes and aims were raised by his success against Sir\r\n    George Booth in the August following, and jealousies soon arose\r\n    between his party in the army and the Rump.  The Parliament would\r\n    have dismissed him, and the chief officers in the cabal with him, but\r\n    Lambert with the army in October hindered their free meeting, and\r\n    took the management of the government into the hands of a council of\r\n    officers, whom they called the Committee of Safety.  Towards the\r\n    latter end of the year, the tide began to be changed in favour of the\r\n    Parliament, by the declaration of Monk in Scotland, Henry Cromwell\r\n    with the army in Ireland, and Hazelrigge and the officers at\r\n    Portsmouth, in favour of the freedom of the Parliament.  This ballad\r\n    was written at the period when Lambert’s party was uppermost.”\r\n\r\nThe tune of “Hei ho, my honey,” may be found in Playford’s edition of\r\n“The English Dancing Master,” printed in 1686, but in no earlier edition\r\nof the same work.\r\n\r\n   GOOD-MORROW, my neighbours all, what news is this I heard tell\r\n   As I past through Westminster-hall by the House that’s neck to hell?\r\n   They told John Lambert {72} was there with his bears, and deeply he\r\n   swore\r\n   (As Cromwell had done before) those vermin should sit there no more.\r\n      Sing hi ho, Wil. Lenthall, {73} who shall our general be?\r\n      For the House to the Devil is sent all, and follow, good faith, mun\r\n   ye!\r\n      Sing hi ho, my honey, my heart shall never rue,\r\n      Here’s all pickt ware for the money, and yet a hard pennyworth too.\r\n\r\n   Then, Muse, strike up a sonnet, come, piper, and play us a spring,\r\n   For now I think upon it, these R’s turn’d out their King;\r\n   But now is come about, that once again they must turn out,\r\n   And not without justice and reason, that every one home to his prison.\r\n      Sing hi ho, Harry Martin, {74} a burgess of the bench,\r\n      There’s nothing here is certain, you must back and leave your\r\n   wench.\r\n            Sing, hi ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   He there with the buffle head is called lord and of the same House,\r\n   Who (as I have heard it said) was chastised by his ladye spouse;\r\n   Because he ran at sheep, she and her maid gave him the whip,\r\n   And beat his head so addle, you’d think he had a knock in the cradle.\r\n      Sing hi ho, Lord Munson, {75} you ha’ got a park of the King’s;\r\n      One day you’l hang like a hounson, for this and other things,\r\n            Sing hi, ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   It was by their master’s orders at first together they met,\r\n   Whom piously they did murder, and since by their own they did set.\r\n   The cause of this disaster is ’cause they were false to their master;\r\n   Nor can they their gens-d’armes blame for serving them the same.\r\n      Sing hi ho, Sir Arthur, {76} no more in the House you shall prate;\r\n      For all you kept such a quarter, {77} you are out of the councell\r\n   of state.\r\n            Sing hi ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   Old Noll once gave them a purge (forgetting OCCIDISTI),\r\n   (The furies be his scourge!) so of the cure must he;\r\n   And yet the drug he well knew it, for he gave it to Dr Huit; {78}\r\n   Had he given it them, he had done it, and they had not turn’d out his\r\n   son yet;\r\n      Sing hi ho, brave Dick, Lenthall, and Lady Joane,\r\n      Who did against lovalty kick is now for a new-year’s gift gone.\r\n            Sing hi ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   For had Old Noll been alive, he had pull’d them out by the ears,\r\n   Or else had fired their hive, and kickt them down the staires;\r\n   Because they were so bold to vex his righteous soul,\r\n   When he so deeply had swore that there they should never sit more.\r\n      But hi ho, Noll’s dead, and stunk long since above ground,\r\n      Though lapt in spices and lead that cost us many a pound.\r\n            Sing hi ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   Indeed, brother burgess, your ling did never stink half so bad,\r\n   Nor did your habberdin when it no pease-straw had;\r\n   Ye both were chose together, ’cause ye wore stuff cloaks in hard\r\n   weather,\r\n   And Cambridge needs would have a burgess fool and knave.\r\n      Sing hi ho, John Lowry, {79} concerning habberdin,\r\n      No member spake before ye, yet you ne’re spoke againe.\r\n            Sing hi, ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   Ned Prideaux {80} he went post to tell the Protector the news,\r\n   That Fleetwood ruld the rost, having tane off Dicke’s shoes.\r\n   And that he did believe, Lambert would him deceive\r\n   As he his brother had gull’d, and Cromwell Fairfax bull’d.\r\n      Sing hi ho, the attorney was still at your command;\r\n      In flames together burn ye, still dancing hand in hand!\r\n            Sing hi ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   Who’s that would hide his face, and his neck from the collar pull?\r\n   He must appear in this place, if his cap be made of wool.\r\n   Who is it? with a vengeance! it is the good Lord St Johns, {81}\r\n   Who made God’s house to fall, to build his own withall.\r\n      Sing hi ho, who comes there? who ’tis I must not say;\r\n      But by his dark lanthorn, I sweare he’s as good in the night as\r\n   day.\r\n            Sing hi ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   Edge, brethren, room for one that looks as big as the best;\r\n   ’Tis pity to leave him alone, for he is as good as the rest;\r\n   No picklock of the laws, he builds among the daws,\r\n   If you ha’ any more kings to murder, for a President look no further.\r\n      Sing hi ho, John Bradshaw, in blood none further engages;\r\n      The Devil from whom he had’s law, will shortly pay him his wages.\r\n            Sing hi ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   Next, Peagoose Wild, {82} come in to show your weesle face,\r\n   And tell us Burley’s sin, whose blood bought you your place;\r\n   When loyalty was a crime, he lived in a dangerous time,\r\n   Was forced to pay his neck to make you baron of the cheque.\r\n      Sing hi ho, Jack Straw, we’ll put it in the margent,\r\n      ’Twas not for justice or law that you were made a sergeant.\r\n            Sing hi ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   Noll served not Satan faster, nor with him did better accord;\r\n   For he was my good master, and the Devil was his good lord.\r\n   Both Slingsby, Gerard, and Hewet, {83} were sure enough to go to it,\r\n   According to his intent, that chose me President.\r\n      Sing hi ho, Lord Lisle, {84} sure law had got a wrench,\r\n      And where was justice the while, when you sate on the bench.\r\n            Sing hi ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   Next comes the good Lord Keble, of the Triumvirate,\r\n   Of the seal in the law but feeble, though on the bench he sate;\r\n   For when one puts him a case, I wish him out of the place,\r\n   And, if it were not a sin, an able lawyer in.\r\n      Sing, give the seal about, I’de have it so the rather,\r\n      Because we might get out the knave, my lord, my father.\r\n            Sing hi ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   Pull out the other three, it is Nathaniel Fines {85}\r\n   (Who Bristol lost for fear), we’ll not leave him behind’s;\r\n   ’Tis a chip of that good old block, who to loyalty gave the first\r\n   knock,\r\n   Then stole away to Lundey, whence the foul fiend fetches him one day.\r\n      Sing hi ho, canting Fines, you and the rest to mend ’um,\r\n      Would ye were served in your kinds with an _ense rescidendum_.\r\n            Sing hi ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   He that comes down-stairs, is Lord Chief Justice Glin; {86}\r\n   If no man for him cares, he cares as little again:\r\n   The reason too I know’t, he helpt cut Strafford’s throat,\r\n   And take away his life, though with a cleaner knife.\r\n      Sing hi ho, Britain bold, straight to the bar you get,\r\n      Where it is not so cold as where your justice set.\r\n            Sing hi ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   He that will next come in, was long of the Council of State,\r\n   Though hardly a hair on his chin when first in the council he sate;\r\n   He was sometime in Italy, and learned their fashions prettily,\r\n   Then came back to’s own nation, to help up reformation.\r\n      Sing hi ho, Harry Nevil, {87} I prythee be not too rash\r\n      With atheism to court the Divel, you’re too bold to be his bardash.\r\n            Sing hi ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   He there with ingratitude blackt is one Cornelius Holland, {88}\r\n   Who, but for the King’s house, lackt wherewith to appease his colon;\r\n   The case is well amended since that time, as I think,\r\n   When at court gate he tended with a little stick and a short link.\r\n      Sing hi ho, Cornelius, your zeal cannot delude us;\r\n      The reason pray now tell ye us why thus you play’d the Judas.\r\n            Sing hi ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   At first he was a grocer who now we Major call,\r\n   Although you would think no, Sir, if you saw him in Whitehall,\r\n   Where he has great command, and looks for cap in hand,\r\n   And if our eggs be not addle, shall be of the next new moddel.\r\n      Sing hi ho, Mr Salloway, {89} the Lord in heaven doth know\r\n      When that from hence you shall away, where to the Devil you’l go.\r\n            Sing hi ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   Little Hill, {90} since set in the House, is to a mountain grown;\r\n   Not that which brought forth the mouse, but thousands the year of his\r\n   own.\r\n   The purchase that I mean, where else but at Taunton Dean;\r\n   Five thousand pounds per annum, a sum not known to his grannam.\r\n      Sing hi, the Good old Cause, {91} ’tis old enough not true\r\n      You got more by that then the laws, so a good old cause to you.\r\n            Sing hi ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   Master Cecil, {92} pray come behind, because on your own accord\r\n   The other House you declined, you shall be no longer a lord;\r\n   The reason, as I guess, you silently did confess,\r\n   Such lords deserved ill the other House to fill.\r\n      Sing hi ho, Mr Cecil, your honour now is gone;\r\n      Such lords are not worth a whistle, we have made better lords of\r\n   our own.\r\n            Sing hi ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   Luke Robinson {93} shall go before ye, that snarling northern tyke;\r\n   Be sure he’ll not adore ye, for honour he doth not like;\r\n   He cannot honour inherit, and he knows he can never merit,\r\n   And therefore he cannot bear it that any one else should wear it.\r\n      Sing hi ho, envious lown, you’re of the beagle’s kind,\r\n      Who always bark’d at the moon, because in the dark it shined.\r\n            Sing hi ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   ’Tis this that vengeance rouses, that, while you make long prayers,\r\n   You eat up widows’ houses, and drink the orphan’s tears;\r\n   Long time you kept a great noise, of God and the Good old Cause;\r\n   But if God to you be so kind, then I’me of the Indian’s mind.\r\n      Sing hi ho, Sir Harry, {94} we see, by your demeanour,\r\n      If longer here you tarry, you’ll be Sir Harry Vane, Senior.\r\n            Sing hi ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   Now if your zeal do warme ye, pray loud for fairer weather;\r\n   Swear to live and die with the army, for these birds are flown\r\n   together;\r\n   The House is turn’d out a doe, (and I think it was no sin, too);\r\n   If we take them there any more, we’ll throw the House out of the\r\n   window.\r\n      Sing hi ho, Tom Scot, {95} you lent the Devil your hand;\r\n      I wonder he helpt you not, but suffred you t’ be trapand.\r\n            Sing hi ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   They’re once again conduced, and we freed from the evil\r\n   To which we long were used; God blesse us next from the Devil!\r\n   If they had not been outed the array had been routed,\r\n   And then this rotten Rump had sat until the last trump.\r\n      But, hi ho, Lambert’s here, the Protector’s instrument bore,\r\n      And many there be who swear that he will do it no more.\r\n            Sing hi ho, etc.\r\n\r\n   Come here, then, honest Peters, {96} say grace for the second course,\r\n   So long as these your betters must patience have upon force,\r\n   Long time he kept a great noise with God and the Good old Cause,\r\n   But if God own such as these, then where’s the Devil’s fees?\r\n      Sing hi ho, Hugo, I hear thou art not dead;\r\n      Where now to the Devil will you go, your patrons being fled?\r\n      Sing hi ho, my honey, my heart shall never rue,\r\n      Four-and-twenty now for a penny, and into the bargain Hugh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TALE OF THE COBBLER AND THE VICAR OF BRAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Rara est concordia fratrum.  Ovid.\r\n\r\n                            By Samuel Butler.\r\n\r\nThe “Sir Samuel” of this Ballad is the same person—Sir Samuel Luke of\r\nBedfordshire—who is supposed to have been the unconscious model of the\r\nportrait which is drawn so much more fully in the inimitable Hudibras.\r\nRalph is also the well-known Squire in the same poem.  The Ballad, though\r\npublished in Butler’s “Posthumous Works,” 1724, was rejected by Thyer in\r\nthe edition of 1784, and is not included in the “Genuine Remains,”\r\npublished from the original manuscripts, formerly in the possession of\r\nWilliam Longueville, Esq.  If not by Butler, it is a successful imitation\r\nof his style, and abounds in phrases of sturdy colloquial English, and is\r\nof a date long anterior to the popular song, “The Vicar of Bray.”\r\n\r\n   IN Bedfordshire there dwelt a knight,\r\n      Sir Samuel by name,\r\n   Who by his feats in civil broils\r\n      Obtain’d a mighty fame.\r\n\r\n   Nor was he much less wise and stout,\r\n      But fit in both respects\r\n   To humble sturdy Cavaliers,\r\n      And to support the sects.\r\n\r\n   This worthy knight was one that swore\r\n      He would not cut his beard\r\n   Till this ungodly nation was\r\n      From kings and bishops clear’d:\r\n\r\n   Which holy vow he firmly kept,\r\n      And most devoutly wore\r\n   A grizly meteor on his face\r\n      Till they were both no more.\r\n\r\n   His worship was, in short, a man\r\n      Of such exceeding worth,\r\n   No pen or pencil can describe,\r\n      Or rhyming bard set forth.\r\n\r\n   Many and mighty things he did\r\n      Both sober and in liquor,—\r\n   Witness the mortal fray between\r\n      The Cobbler and the Vicar;\r\n\r\n   Which by his wisdom and his power\r\n      He wisely did prevent,\r\n   And both the combatants at once\r\n      In wooden durance pent.\r\n\r\n   The manner how these two fell out\r\n      And quarrell’d in their ale,\r\n   I shall attempt at large to show\r\n      In the succeeding tale.\r\n\r\n   A strolling cobbler, who was wont\r\n      To trudge from town to town,\r\n   Happen’d upon his walk to meet\r\n      A vicar in his gown.\r\n\r\n   And as they forward jogg’d along,\r\n      The vicar, growing hot,\r\n   First asked the cobbler if he knew\r\n      Where they might take a pot?\r\n\r\n   Yes, marry that I do, quoth he;\r\n      Here is a house hard by,\r\n   That far exceeds all Bedfordshire\r\n      For ale and landlady.\r\n\r\n   Thither let’s go, the vicar said;\r\n      And when they thither came,\r\n   He liked the liquor wondrous well,\r\n      But better far the dame.\r\n\r\n   And she, who, like a cunning jilt,\r\n      Knew how to please her guest,\r\n   Used all her little tricks and arts\r\n      To entertain the priest.\r\n\r\n   The cobbler too, who quickly saw\r\n      The landlady’s design,\r\n   Did all that in his power was\r\n      To manage the divine.\r\n\r\n   With smutty jests and merry songs\r\n      They charm’d the vicar so,\r\n   That he determined for that night\r\n      No further he would go.\r\n\r\n   And being fixt, the cobbler thought\r\n      ’Twas proper to go try\r\n   If he could get a job or two\r\n      His charges to supply.\r\n\r\n   So going out into the street,\r\n      He bawls with all his might,—\r\n   If any of you tread awry\r\n      I’m here to set you right.\r\n\r\n   I can repair your leaky boots,\r\n      And underlay your soles;\r\n   Backsliders, I can underprop\r\n      And patch up all your holes.\r\n\r\n   The vicar, who unluckily\r\n      The cobbler’s outcry heard,\r\n   From off the bench on which he sat\r\n      With mighty fury rear’d.\r\n\r\n   Quoth he, What priest, what holy priest\r\n      Can hear this bawling slave,\r\n   But must, in justice to his coat,\r\n      Chastise the saucy knave?\r\n\r\n   What has this wretch to do with souls,\r\n      Or with backsliders either,\r\n   Whose business only is his awls,\r\n      His lasts, his thread, and leather?\r\n\r\n   I lose my patience to be made\r\n      This strolling varlet’s sport;\r\n   Nor could I think this saucy rogue\r\n      Could serve me in such sort.\r\n\r\n   The cobbler, who had no design\r\n      The vicar to displease,\r\n   Unluckily repeats again,—\r\n      I’m come your soals to ease:\r\n\r\n   The inward and the outward too\r\n      I can repair and mend;\r\n   And all that my assistance want,\r\n      I’ll use them like a friend.\r\n\r\n   The country folk no sooner heard\r\n      The honest cobbler’s tongue,\r\n   But from the village far and near\r\n      They round about him throng.\r\n\r\n   Some bring their boots, and some their shoes,\r\n      And some their buskins bring:\r\n   The cobbler sits him down to work,\r\n      And then begins to sing.\r\n\r\n   Death often at the cobbler’s stall\r\n      Was wont to make a stand,\r\n   But found the cobbler singing still,\r\n      And on the mending hand;\r\n\r\n   Until at length he met old Time,\r\n      And then they both together\r\n   Quite tear the cobbler’s aged sole\r\n      From off the upper leather.\r\n\r\n   Even so a while I may old shoes\r\n      By care and art maintain,\r\n   But when the leather’s rotten grown\r\n      All art and care is vain.\r\n\r\n   And thus the cobbler stitched and sung,\r\n      Not thinking any harm;\r\n   Till out the angry vicar came\r\n      With ale and passion warm.\r\n\r\n   Dost thou not know, vile slave! quoth he,\r\n      How impious ’tis to jest\r\n   With sacred things, and to profane\r\n      The office of a priest?\r\n\r\n   How dar’st thou, most audacious wretch!\r\n      Those vile expressions use,\r\n   Which make the souls of men as cheap\r\n      As soals of boots and shoes?\r\n\r\n   Such reprobates as you betray\r\n      Our character and gown,\r\n   And would, if you had once the power,\r\n      The Church itself pull down.\r\n\r\n   The cobbler, not aware that he\r\n      Had done or said amiss,\r\n   Reply’d, I do not understand\r\n      What you can mean by this.\r\n\r\n   Tho’ I but a poor cobbler be,\r\n      And stroll about for bread,\r\n   None better loves the Church than I\r\n      That ever wore a head.\r\n\r\n   But since you are so good at names,\r\n      And make so loud a pother,\r\n   I’ll tell you plainly I’m afraid\r\n      You’re but some cobbling brother.\r\n\r\n   Come, vicar, tho’ you talk so big,\r\n      Our trades are near akin;\r\n   I patch and cobble outward soals\r\n      As you do those within.\r\n\r\n   And I’ll appeal to any man\r\n      That understands the nation,\r\n   If I han’t done more good than you\r\n      In my respective station.\r\n\r\n   Old leather, I must needs confess,\r\n      I’ve sometimes used as new,\r\n   And often pared the soal so near\r\n      That I have spoil’d the shoe.\r\n\r\n   You vicars, by a different way,\r\n      Have done the very same;\r\n   For you have pared your doctrines so\r\n      You made religion lame.\r\n\r\n   Your principles you’ve quite disown’d,\r\n      And old ones changed for new,\r\n   That no man can distinguish right\r\n      Which are the false or true.\r\n\r\n   I dare be bold, you’re one of those\r\n      Have took the Covenant;\r\n   With Cavaliers are Cavalier,\r\n      And with the saints a saint.\r\n\r\n   The vicar at this sharp rebuke\r\n      Begins to storm and swear;\r\n   Quoth he, Thou vile apostate wretch!\r\n      Dost thou with me compare?\r\n\r\n   I that have care of many souls,\r\n      And power to damn or save,\r\n   Dar’st thou thyself compare with me,\r\n      Thou vile, ungodly knave!\r\n\r\n   I wish I had thee somewhere else,\r\n      I’d quickly make thee know\r\n   What ’tis to make comparisons,\r\n      And to revile me so.\r\n\r\n   Thou art an enemy to the State,\r\n      Some priest in masquerade,\r\n   That, to promote the Pope’s designs,\r\n      Has learnt the cobbling trade:\r\n\r\n   Or else some spy to Cavaliers,\r\n      And art by them sent out\r\n   To carry false intelligence,\r\n      And scatter lies about.\r\n\r\n   But whilst the vicar full of ire\r\n      Was railing at this rate,\r\n   His worship, good Sir Samuel,\r\n      O’erlighted at the gate.\r\n\r\n   And asking of the landlady\r\n      Th’ occasion of the stir;\r\n   Quoth she, If you will give me leave\r\n      I will inform you, Sir.\r\n\r\n   This cobbler happening to o’ertake\r\n      The vicar in his walk,\r\n   In friendly sort they forward march,\r\n      And to each other talk.\r\n\r\n   Until the parson first proposed\r\n      To stop and take a whet;\r\n   So cheek by jole they hither came\r\n      Like travellers well met.\r\n\r\n   A world of healths and jests went round,\r\n      Sometimes a merry tale;\r\n   Till they resolved to stay all night,\r\n      So well they liked my ale.\r\n\r\n   Thus all things lovingly went on,\r\n      And who so great as they;\r\n   Before an ugly accident\r\n      Began this mortal fray.\r\n\r\n   The case I take it to be this,—\r\n      The vicar being fixt,\r\n   The cobbler chanced to cry his trade,\r\n      And in his cry he mixt\r\n\r\n   Some harmless words, which I suppose\r\n      The vicar falsely thought\r\n   Might be design’d to banter him,\r\n      And scandalize his coat.\r\n\r\n   If that be all, quoth he, go out\r\n      And bid them both come in;\r\n   A dozen of your nappy ale\r\n      Will set ’em right again.\r\n\r\n   And if the ale should chance to fail,\r\n      For so perhaps it may,\r\n   I have it in my powers to try\r\n      A more effectual way.\r\n\r\n   These vicars are a wilful tribe,\r\n      A restless, stubborn crew;\r\n   And if they are not humbled quite,\r\n      The State they will undo.\r\n\r\n   The cobbler is a cunning knave,\r\n      That goes about by stealth,\r\n   And would, instead of mending shoes,\r\n      Repair the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n   However, bid ’em both come in,\r\n      This fray must have an end;\r\n   Such little feuds as these do oft\r\n      To greater mischiefs tend.\r\n\r\n   Without more bidding out she goes\r\n      And told them, by her troth,\r\n   There was a magistrate within\r\n      That needs must see ’em both.\r\n\r\n   But, gentlemen, pray distance keep,\r\n      And don’t too testy be;\r\n   Ill words good manners still corrupt\r\n      And spoil good company.\r\n\r\n   To this the vicar first replies,\r\n      I fear no magistrate;\r\n   For let ’em make what laws they will,\r\n      I’ll still obey the State.\r\n\r\n   Whatever I can say or do,\r\n      I’m sure not much avails;\r\n   I stall still be Vicar of Bray\r\n      Whichever side prevails.\r\n\r\n   My conscience, thanks to Heaven, is come\r\n      To such a happy pass,\r\n   That I can take the Covenant\r\n      And never hang an ass.\r\n\r\n   I’ve took so many oaths before,\r\n      That now without remorse\r\n   I take all oaths the State can make,\r\n      As meerly things of course.\r\n\r\n   Go therefore, dame, the justice tell\r\n      His summons I’ll obey;\r\n   And further you may let him know\r\n      I Vicar am of Bray.\r\n\r\n   I find indeed, the cobbler said,\r\n      I am not much mistaken;\r\n   This vicar knows the ready way\r\n      To save his reverend bacon. {97}\r\n\r\n   This is a hopeful priest indeed,\r\n      And well deserves a rope;\r\n   Rather than lose his vicarage\r\n      He’d swear to Turk or Pope.\r\n\r\n   For gain he would his God deny,\r\n      His country and his King;\r\n   Swear and forswear, recant and lye,\r\n      Do any wicked thing.\r\n\r\n   At this the vicar set his teeth,\r\n      And to the cobbler flew;\r\n   And with his sacerdotal fist\r\n      Gave him a box or two.\r\n\r\n   The cobbler soon return’d the blows,\r\n      And with both head and heel\r\n   So manfully behaved himself,\r\n      He made the vicar reel.\r\n\r\n   Great was the outcry that was made,\r\n      And in the woman ran\r\n   To tell his worship that the fight\r\n      Betwixt them was began.\r\n\r\n   And is it so indeed? quoth he;\r\n      I’ll make the slaves repent:\r\n   Then up he took his basket hilt,\r\n      And out enraged he went.\r\n\r\n   The country folk no sooner saw\r\n      The knight with naked blade,\r\n   But for his worship instantly\r\n      An open lane was made;\r\n\r\n   Who with a stern and angry look\r\n      Cry’d out, What knaves are these\r\n   That in the face of justice dare\r\n      Disturb the public peace?\r\n\r\n   Vile rascals!  I will make you know\r\n      I am a magistrate,\r\n   And that as such I bear about\r\n      The vengeance of the State.\r\n\r\n   Go, seize them, Ralph, and bring them in,\r\n      That I may know the cause,\r\n   That first induced them to this rage,\r\n      And thus to break the laws.\r\n\r\n   Ralph, who was both his squire and clerk,\r\n      And constable withal,\r\n   I’ th’ name o’ th’ Commonwealth aloud\r\n      Did for assistance bawl.\r\n\r\n   The words had hardly pass’d his mouth\r\n      But they secure them both;\r\n   And Ralph, to show his furious zeal\r\n      And hatred to the cloth,\r\n\r\n   Runs to the vicar through the crowd,\r\n      And takes him by the throat:\r\n   How ill, says he, doth this become\r\n      Your character and coat!\r\n\r\n   Was it for this not long ago\r\n      You took the Covenant,\r\n   And in most solemn manner swore\r\n      That you’d become a saint?\r\n\r\n   And here he gave him such a pinch\r\n      That made the vicar shout,—\r\n   Good people, I shall murder’d be\r\n      By this ungodly lout.\r\n\r\n   He gripes my throat to that degree\r\n      I can’t his talons bear;\r\n   And if you do not hold his hands,\r\n      He’ll throttle me, I fear.\r\n\r\n   At this a butcher of the town\r\n      Steps up to Ralph in ire,—\r\n   What, will you squeeze his gullet through,\r\n      You son of blood and fire?\r\n\r\n   You are the Devil’s instrument\r\n      To execute the laws;\r\n   What, will you murther the poor man\r\n      With your phanatick claws?\r\n\r\n   At which the squire quits his hold,\r\n      And lugging out his blade,\r\n   Full at the sturdy butcher’s pate\r\n      A furious stroke he made.\r\n\r\n   A dismal outcry then began\r\n      Among the country folk;\r\n   Who all conclude the butcher slain\r\n      By such a mortal stroke.\r\n\r\n   But here good fortune, that has still\r\n      A friendship for the brave,\r\n   I’ th’ nick misguides the fatal blow,\r\n      And does the butcher save.\r\n\r\n   The knight, who heard the noise within,\r\n      Runs out with might and main,\r\n   And seeing Ralph amidst the crowd\r\n      In danger to be slain,\r\n\r\n   Without regard to age or sex\r\n      Old basket-hilt so ply’d,\r\n   That in an instant three or four\r\n      Lay bleeding at his side.\r\n\r\n   And greater mischiefs in his rage\r\n      This furious knight had done,\r\n   If he had not prevented been\r\n      By Dick, the blacksmith’s son,\r\n\r\n   Who catch’d his worship on the hip,\r\n      And gave him such a squelch,\r\n   That he some moments breathless lay\r\n      Ere he was heard to belch.\r\n\r\n   Nor was the squire in better case,\r\n      By sturdy butcher ply’d,\r\n   Who from the shoulder to the flank\r\n      Had soundly swinged his hide.\r\n\r\n   Whilst things in this confusion stood,\r\n      And knight and squire disarm’d,\r\n   Up comes a neighbouring gentleman\r\n      The outcry had alarm’d;\r\n\r\n   Who riding up among the crowd,\r\n      The vicar first he spy’d,\r\n   With sleeveless gown and bloody band\r\n      And hands behind him ty’d.\r\n\r\n   Bless me, says he, what means all this?\r\n      Then turning round his eyes,\r\n   In the same plight, or in a worse,\r\n      The cobbler bleeding spies.\r\n\r\n   And looking further round he saw,\r\n      Like one in doleful dump,\r\n   The knight, amidst a gaping mob,\r\n      Sit pensive on his rump.\r\n\r\n   And by his side lay Ralph his squire,\r\n      Whom butcher fell had maul’d;\r\n   Who bitterly bemoan’d his fate,\r\n      And for a surgeon call’d.\r\n\r\n   Surprised at first he paused awhile,\r\n      And then accosts the knight,—\r\n   What makes you here, Sir Samuel,\r\n      In this unhappy plight?\r\n\r\n   At this the knight gave’s breast a thump,\r\n      And stretching out his hand,—\r\n   If you will pull me up, he cried,\r\n      I’ll try if I can stand.\r\n\r\n   And then I’ll let you know the cause;\r\n      But first take care of Ralph,\r\n   Who in my good or ill success\r\n      Doth always stand my half.\r\n\r\n   In short, he got his worship up\r\n      And led him in the door;\r\n   Where he at length relates the tale\r\n      As I have told before.\r\n\r\n   When he had heard the story out,\r\n      The gentleman replies,—\r\n   It is not in my province, sir,\r\n      Your worship to advise.\r\n\r\n   But were I in your worship’s place,\r\n      The only thing I’d do,\r\n   Was first to reprimand the fools,\r\n      And then to let them go.\r\n\r\n   I think it first advisable\r\n      To take them from the rabble,\r\n   And let them come and both set forth\r\n      The occasion of the squabble.\r\n\r\n   This is the Vicar, Sir, of Bray,\r\n      A man of no repute,\r\n   The scorn and scandal of his tribe,\r\n      A loose, ill-manner’d brute.\r\n\r\n   The cobbler’s a poor strolling wretch\r\n      That mends my servants’ shoes;\r\n   And often calls as he goes by\r\n      To bring me country news.\r\n\r\n   At this his worship grip’d his beard,\r\n      And in an angry mood,\r\n   Swore by the laws of chivalry\r\n      That blood required blood.\r\n\r\n   Besides, I’m by the Commonwealth\r\n      Entrusted to chastise\r\n   All knaves that straggle up and down\r\n      To raise such mutinies.\r\n\r\n   However, since ’tis your request,\r\n      They shall be call’d and heard;\r\n   But neither Ralph nor I can grant\r\n      Such rascals should be clear’d.\r\n\r\n   And so, to wind the tale up short,\r\n      They were call’d in together;\r\n   And by the gentlemen were ask’d\r\n      What wind ’twas blew them thither.\r\n\r\n   Good ale and handsome landladies\r\n      You might have nearer home;\r\n   And therefore ’tis for something more\r\n      That you so far are come.\r\n\r\n   To which the vicar answer’d first,—\r\n      My living is so small,\r\n   That I am forced to stroll about\r\n      To try and get a call.\r\n\r\n   And, quoth the cobbler, I am forced\r\n      To leave my wife and dwelling,\r\n   T’ escape the danger of being press’d\r\n      To go a colonelling.\r\n\r\n   There’s many an honest jovial lad\r\n      Unwarily drawn in,\r\n   That I have reason to suspect\r\n      Will scarce get out again.\r\n\r\n   The proverb says, _Harm watch harm catch_,\r\n      I’ll out of danger keep,\r\n   For he that sleeps in a whole skin\r\n      Doth most securely sleep.\r\n\r\n   My business is to mend bad soals\r\n      And stitch up broken quarters:\r\n   A cobbler’s name would look but odd\r\n      Among a list of martyrs.\r\n\r\n   Faith, cobbler, quoth the gentleman,\r\n      And that shall be my case;\r\n   I will neither party join,\r\n      Let what will come to pass.\r\n\r\n   No importunities or threats\r\n      My fixt resolves shall rest;\r\n   Come here, Sir Samuel, where’s his health\r\n      That loves old England best.\r\n\r\n   I pity those unhappy fools\r\n      Who, ere they were aware,\r\n   Designing and ambitious men\r\n      Have drawn into a snare.\r\n\r\n   But, vicar, to come to the case,—\r\n      Amidst a senseless crowd,\r\n   What urged you to such violence,\r\n      And made you talk so loud?\r\n\r\n   Passion I’m sure does ill become\r\n      Your character and cloath,\r\n   And, tho’ the cause be ne’er so just,\r\n      Brings scandal upon both.\r\n\r\n   Vicar, I speak it with regret,\r\n      An inadvertent priest\r\n   Renders himself ridiculous,\r\n      And every body’s jest.\r\n\r\n   The vicar to be thus rebuked\r\n      A little time stood mute;\r\n   But having gulp’d his passion down,\r\n      Replies,—That cobbling brute\r\n\r\n   Has treated me with such contempt,\r\n      Such vile expressions used,\r\n   That I no longer could forbear\r\n      To hear myself abused.\r\n\r\n   The rascal had the insolence\r\n      To give himself the lie,\r\n   And to aver h’ had done more good\r\n      And saved more soals than I.\r\n\r\n   Nay, further, Sir, this miscreant\r\n      To tell me was so bold,\r\n   Our trades were very near of kin,\r\n      But his was the more old.\r\n\r\n   Now, Sir, I will to you appeal\r\n      On such a provocation,\r\n   If there was not sufficient cause\r\n      To use a little passion?\r\n\r\n   Now, quoth the cobbler, with your leave,\r\n      I’ll prove it to his face,\r\n   All this is mere suggestion,\r\n      And foreign to the case.\r\n\r\n   And since he calls so many names\r\n      And talks so very loud,\r\n   I will be bound to make it plain\r\n      ’Twas he that raised the crowd.\r\n\r\n   Nay, further, I will make ’t appear\r\n      He and the priests have done\r\n   More mischief than the cobblers far\r\n      All over Christendom.\r\n\r\n   All Europe groans beneath their yoke,\r\n      And poor Great Britain owes\r\n   To them her present miseries,\r\n      And dread of future woes.\r\n\r\n   The priests of all religions are\r\n      And will be still the same,\r\n   And all, tho’ in a different way,\r\n      Are playing the same game.\r\n\r\n   At this the gentleman stood up,—\r\n      Cobbler, you run too fast;\r\n   By thus condemning all the tribe\r\n      You go beyond your last.\r\n\r\n   Much mischief has by priests been done,\r\n      And more is doing still;\r\n   But then to censure all alike\r\n      Must be exceeding ill.\r\n\r\n   Too many, I must needs confess,\r\n      Are mightily to blame,\r\n   Who by their wicked practices\r\n      Disgrace the very name.\r\n\r\n   But, cobbler, still the major part\r\n      The minor should conclude;\r\n   To argue at another rate’s\r\n      Impertinent and rude.\r\n\r\n   By this time all the neighbours round\r\n      Were flock’d about the door,\r\n   And some were on the vicar’s side,\r\n      But on the cobbler’s more.\r\n\r\n   Among the rest a grazier, who\r\n      Had lately been at town\r\n   To sell his oxen and his sheep,\r\n      Brim-full of news came down.\r\n\r\n   Quoth he, The priests have preach’d and pray’d,\r\n      And made so damn’d a pother,\r\n   That all the people are run mad\r\n      To murther one another.\r\n\r\n   By their contrivances and arts\r\n      They’ve play’d their game so long,\r\n   That no man knows which side is right,\r\n      Or which is in the wrong.\r\n\r\n   I’m sure I’ve Smithfield market used\r\n      For more than twenty year,\r\n   But never did such murmurings\r\n      And dreadful outcries hear.\r\n\r\n   Some for a church, and some a tub,\r\n      And some for both together;\r\n   And some, perhaps the greater part,\r\n      Have no regard for either.\r\n\r\n   Some for a king, and some for none;\r\n      And some have hankerings\r\n   To mend the Commonwealth, and make\r\n      An empire of all kings.\r\n\r\n   What’s worse, old Noll is marching off,\r\n      And Dick, his heir-apparent,\r\n   Succeeds him in the government,\r\n      A very lame vicegerent.\r\n\r\n   He’ll reign but little time, poor fool,\r\n      But sink beneath the State,\r\n   That will not fail to ride the fool\r\n      ’Bove common horseman’s weight.\r\n\r\n   And rulers, when they lose the power,\r\n      Like horses overweigh’d,\r\n   Must either fall and break their knees,\r\n      Or else turn perfect jade.\r\n\r\n   The vicar to be twice rebuked\r\n      No longer could contain;\r\n   But thus replies,—To knaves like you\r\n      All arguments are vain.\r\n\r\n   The Church must use her arm of flesh,\r\n      The other will not do;\r\n   The clergy waste their breath and time\r\n      On miscreants like you.\r\n\r\n   You are so stubborn and so proud,\r\n      So dull and prepossest,\r\n   That no instructions can prevail\r\n      How well soe’er addrest.\r\n\r\n   Who would reform such reprobates,\r\n      Must drub them soundly first;\r\n   I know no other way but that\r\n      To make them wise or just.\r\n\r\n   Fie, vicar, fie, his patron said,\r\n      Sure that is not the way;\r\n   You should instruct your auditors\r\n      To suffer or obey.\r\n\r\n   Those were the doctrines that of old\r\n      The learned fathers taught;\r\n   And ’twas by them the Church at first\r\n      Was to perfection brought.\r\n\r\n   Come, vicar, lay your feuds aside,\r\n      And calmly take your cup;\r\n   And let us try in friendly wise\r\n      To make the matter up.\r\n\r\n   That’s certainly the wiser course,\r\n      And better too by far;\r\n   All men of prudence strive to quench\r\n      The sparks of civil war.\r\n\r\n   By furious heats and ill advice\r\n      Our neighbours are undone,\r\n   Then let us timely caution take\r\n      From their destruction.\r\n\r\n   If we would turn our heads about,\r\n      And look towards forty-one,\r\n   We soon should see what little jars\r\n      Those cruel wars begun.\r\n\r\n   A one-eyed cobbler then was one\r\n      Of that rebellious crew,\r\n   That did in Charles the martyr’s blood\r\n      Their wicked hands imbrue.\r\n\r\n   I mention this not to deface\r\n      This cobbler’s reputation,\r\n   Whom I have always honest found,\r\n      And useful in his station.\r\n\r\n   But this I urge to let you see\r\n      The danger of a fight\r\n   Between a cobbler and a priest,\r\n      Though he were ne’er so right.\r\n\r\n   The vicars are a numerous tribe,\r\n      So are the cobblers too;\r\n   And if a general quarrel rise,\r\n      What must the country do?\r\n\r\n   Our outward and our inward soals\r\n      Must quickly want repair;\r\n   And all the neighbourhood around\r\n      Would the misfortune share.\r\n\r\n   Sir, quoth the grazier, I believe\r\n      Our outward soals indeed\r\n   May quickly want the cobbler’s help\r\n      To be from leakings freed.\r\n\r\n   But for our inward souls, I think\r\n      They’re of a worth too great\r\n   To be committed to the care\r\n      Of any holy cheat,\r\n\r\n   Who only serves his God for gain,\r\n      Religion is his trade;\r\n   And ’tis by such as these our Church\r\n      So scandalous is made.\r\n\r\n   Why should I trust my soul with one\r\n      That preaches, swears, and prays,\r\n   And the next moment contradicts\r\n      Himself in all he says?\r\n\r\n   His solemn oaths he looks upon\r\n      As only words of course!\r\n   Which like their wives our fathers took\r\n      For better or for worse.\r\n\r\n   But he takes oaths as some take w—s,\r\n      Only to serve his ease;\r\n   And rogues and w—s, it is well known,\r\n      May part whene’er they please.\r\n\r\n   At this the cobbler bolder grew,\r\n      And stoutly thus reply’d,—\r\n   If you’re so good at drubbing, Sir,\r\n      Your manhood shall be try’d.\r\n\r\n   What I have said I will maintain,\r\n      And further prove withal—\r\n   I daily do more good than you\r\n      In my respective call.\r\n\r\n   I know your character, quoth he,\r\n      You proud insulting vicar,\r\n   Who only huff and domineer\r\n      And quarrel in your liquor.\r\n\r\n   The honest gentleman, who saw\r\n      ’Twould come again to blows,\r\n   Commands the cobbler to forbear,\r\n      And to the vicar goes.\r\n\r\n   Vicar, says he, for shame give o’er\r\n      And mitigate your rage;\r\n   You scandalize your cloth too much\r\n      A cobbler to engage.\r\n\r\n   All people’s eyes are on your tribe,\r\n      And every little ill\r\n   They multiply and aggravate\r\n      And will because they will.\r\n\r\n   But now let’s call another cause,\r\n      So let this health go round;\r\n   Be peace and plenty, truth and right,\r\n      In good old England found.\r\n\r\n   Quoth Ralph, All this is empty talk\r\n      And only tends to laughter;\r\n   If these two varlets should be spared,\r\n      Who’d pity us hereafter?\r\n\r\n   Your worship may do what you please,\r\n      But I’ll have satisfaction\r\n   For drubbing and for damages\r\n      In this ungodly action.\r\n\r\n   I think that you can do no less\r\n      Than send them to the stocks;\r\n   And I’ll assist the constable\r\n      In fixing in their hocks.\r\n\r\n   There let ’em sit and fight it out,\r\n      Or scold till they are friends;\r\n   Or, what is better much than both,\r\n      Till I am made amends.\r\n\r\n   Ralph, quoth the knight, that’s well advised,\r\n      Let them both hither go,\r\n   And you and the sub-magistrate\r\n      Take care that it be so.\r\n\r\n   Let them be lock’d in face to face,\r\n      Bare buttocks on the ground;\r\n   And let them in that posture sit\r\n      Till they with us compound.\r\n\r\n   Thus fixt, well leave them for a time,\r\n      Whilst we with grief relate,\r\n   How at a wake this knight and squire\r\n      Got each a broken pate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENEVA BALLAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  From Samuel Butler’s Posthumous Works.\r\n\r\n   OF all the factions in the town\r\n      Moved by French springs or Flemish wheels,\r\n   None turns religion upside down,\r\n      Or tears pretences out at heels,\r\n   Like _Splaymouth_ with his brace of caps,\r\n   Whose conscience might be scann’d perhaps\r\n   By the dimensions of his chaps;\r\n\r\n   He whom the sisters do adore,\r\n      Counting his actions all divine,\r\n   Who when the spirit hints can roar,\r\n      And, if occasion serves, can whine;\r\n   Nay, he can bellow, bray, or bark;\r\n   Was ever _sike a Beauk-learn’d_ clerk\r\n   That speaks all linguas of the ark?\r\n\r\n   To draw the hornets in like bees,\r\n      With pleasing twangs he tones his prose;\r\n   He gives his handkerchief a squeeze,\r\n      And draws John Calvin thro’ his nose;\r\n   Motive on motive he obtrudes,\r\n   With slip-stocking similitudes,\r\n   Eight uses more, and so concludes.\r\n\r\n   When monarchy began to bleed,\r\n      And treason had a fine new name;\r\n   When Thames was balderdash’d with Tweed,\r\n      And pulpits did like beacons flame;\r\n   When Jeroboam’s calves were rear’d,\r\n   And Laud was neither loved nor fear’d,\r\n   This gospel-comet first appear’d.\r\n\r\n   Soon his unhallow’d fingers stript\r\n      His sovereign-liege of power and land;\r\n   And, having smote his master, slipt\r\n      His sword into his fellow’s hand;\r\n   But he that wears his eyes may note\r\n   Oft-times the butcher binds a goat,\r\n   And leaves his boy to cut her throat.\r\n\r\n   Poor England felt his fury then\r\n      Outweigh’d Queen Mary’s many grains;\r\n   His very preaching slew more men\r\n      Than Bonnar’s faggots, stakes, and chains:\r\n   With dog-star zeal, and lungs like Boreas,\r\n   He fought, and taught, and, what’s notorious,\r\n   Destroy’d his Lord to make him glorious.\r\n\r\n   Yet drew for King and Parliament,\r\n      As if the wind could stand north-south;\r\n   Broke Moses’ law with blest intent,\r\n      Murther’d, and then he wiped his mouth:\r\n   Oblivion alters not his case,\r\n   Nor clemency nor acts of grace\r\n   Can blanch an Ethiopian’s face.\r\n\r\n   Ripe for rebellion, he begins\r\n      To rally up the saints in swarms;\r\n   He bawls aloud, Sir, leave your sins,\r\n      But whispers, Boys, stand to your arms:\r\n   Thus he’s grown insolently rude,\r\n   Thinking his gods can’t be subdued—\r\n   _Money_, I mean, and _multitude_.\r\n\r\n   Magistrates he regards no more\r\n      Than St George or the King of Colon,\r\n   Vowing he’ll not conform before\r\n      The old wives wind their dead in woollen:\r\n   He calls the bishop gray-hair’d coff,\r\n   And makes his power as mere a scoff\r\n   As Dagon when his hands were off.\r\n\r\n   Hark! how he opens with full cry,\r\n      Halloo, my hearts, beware of Rome!\r\n   Cowards that are afraid to die\r\n      Thus make domestic brawls at home.\r\n   How quietly great Charles might reign,\r\n   Would all these Hotspurs cross the main\r\n   And preach down Popery in Spain.\r\n\r\n   The starry rule of Heaven is fixt,\r\n      There’s no dissension in the sky;\r\n   And can there be a mean betwixt,\r\n      Confusion and conformity?\r\n   A place divided never thrives,\r\n   ’Tis bad when hornets dwell in hives,\r\n   But worse when children play with knives.\r\n\r\n   I would as soon turn back to mass,\r\n      Or change my praise to _Thee_ and _Thou_;\r\n   Let the Pope ride me like an ass,\r\n      And his priests milk me like a cow!\r\n   As buckle to Smectymnian laws,\r\n   The bad effects o’ th’ Good old Cause,\r\n   That have dove’s plumes, but vulture’s claws.\r\n\r\n   For ’twas the holy Kirk that nursed,\r\n      The Brownists and the ranters’ crew;\r\n   Foul error’s motley vesture first\r\n      Was oaded {98} in a northern blue;\r\n   And what’s th’ enthusiastick breed,\r\n   Or men of Knipperdolin’s creed,\r\n   But Cov’nanters run up to seed!\r\n\r\n   Yet they all cry they love the King,\r\n      And make boast of their innocence:\r\n   There cannot be so vile a thing\r\n      But may be cover’d with pretence;\r\n   Yet when all’s said, one thing I’ll swear,\r\n   No subject like th’ old Cavalier,\r\n   No traytor like _Jack-Presbyter_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVIL’S PROGRESS ON EARTH,\r\nOR\r\nHUGGLE

Away the Devil goeth;\r\n   For there is all plain dealing,\r\n      For that the Devil knoweth:\r\n   But the rich man reaps the gains\r\n      For which the poor man plough’d.\r\n         Huggle

flourish,\r\n      Plain dealing was in a cloud.\r\n         Huggle Duggle, Ha! ha! ha!\r\n      The devils laugh’d aloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA BOTTLE DEFINITION OF THAT FALLEN ANGEL, CALLED A WHIG.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a collection of Historical and State Poems, Satyrs, Songs, and\r\nEpigrams, by Ned Ward, A. D. 1717.\r\n\r\n   WHAT is a Whig?  A cunning rogue\r\n   That once was in, now out of vogue:\r\n   A rebel to the Church and throne,\r\n   Of Lucifer the very spawn.\r\n\r\n   A tyrant, who is ne’er at rest\r\n   In power, or when he’s dispossess’d;\r\n   A knave, who foolishly has lost\r\n   What so much blood and treasure cost.\r\n\r\n   A lying, bouncing desperado,\r\n   A bomb, a stink-pot, a granado;\r\n   That’s ready primed, and charged to break,\r\n   And mischief do for mischief’s sake:\r\n\r\n   A comet, whose portending phiz\r\n   Appears more dreadful than it is;\r\n   But now propitious stars repel\r\n   Those ills it lastly did fortel.\r\n\r\n   ’Twill burst with unregarded spight,\r\n   And, since the Parliament proves right,\r\n   Will turn to smoke, which shone of late\r\n   So bright and flaming in the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DESPONDING WHIG.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  From Ned Ward’s Works, vol. iv. 1709.\r\n\r\n   WHEN owles are strip’d of their disguise,\r\n      And wolves of shepherd’s cloathing,\r\n   Those birds and beasts that please our eyes\r\n      Will then beget our loathing;\r\n   When foxes tremble in their holes\r\n      At dangers that they see,\r\n   And those we think so wise prove fools,\r\n      Then low, boys, down go we.\r\n\r\n   If those designs abortive prove\r\n      We’ve been so long in hatching,\r\n   And cunning knaves are forced to move\r\n      From home for fear of catching;\r\n   The rabble soon will change their tone\r\n      When our intrigues they see,\r\n   And cry God save the Church and Throne,\r\n      Then low, boys, down go we.\r\n\r\n   The weaver then no more must leave\r\n      His loom and turn a preacher,\r\n   Nor with his cant poor fools deceive\r\n      To make himself the richer.\r\n   Our leaders soon would disappear\r\n      If such a change should be,\r\n   Our scriblers too would stink for fear,\r\n      Then low, boys, down go we.\r\n\r\n   No canvisars would dare to shew\r\n      Their postures and grimaces,\r\n   Or proph’sy what they never knew,\r\n      By dint of ugly faces.\r\n   But shove the tumbler through the town,\r\n      And quickly banish’d be,\r\n   For none must teach without a gown,\r\n      Then low, boys, down go we.\r\n\r\n   If such unhappy days should come,\r\n      Our virtue, moderation,\r\n   Would surely be repaid us home\r\n      With double compensation;\r\n   For as we never could forgive,\r\n      I fear we then should see\r\n   That what we lent we must receive,\r\n      Then low, boys, down go we.\r\n\r\n   Should honest brethren once discern\r\n      Our knaveries, they’d disown us,\r\n   And bubbl’d fools more wit should learn,\r\n      The Lord have mercy on us;\r\n   Let’s guard against that evil day,\r\n      Least such a time should be,\r\n   And tackers should come into play,\r\n      Then low, boys, down go we.\r\n\r\n   Tho’ hitherto we’ve play’d our parts\r\n      Like wary cunning foxes,\r\n   And gain’d the common people’s hearts\r\n      By broaching het’rodoxes,—\r\n   But they’re as fickle as the winds,\r\n      With nothing long agree,\r\n   And when they change their wav’ring minds,\r\n      Then low, boys, down go we.\r\n\r\n   Let’s preach and pray, but spit our gall\r\n      On those that do oppose us,\r\n   And cant of grace, in spite of all\r\n      The shame the Devil owes us:\r\n   The just, the loyal, and the wise\r\n      With us shall Papists be,\r\n   For if the _High Church_ once should rise,\r\n      Then, _Low Church_, down go we.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHANATICK ZEAL,\r\nOR\r\nA LOOKING-GLASS FOR THE

so:\r\n   And a Whig now is known\r\n      To be the nation’s foe?\r\n         So a Tory I will be, will be,\r\n         And a Tory I will be.\r\n\r\n   With little band precise,\r\n      Hair Presbyterian cut,\r\n   Whig turns up hands and eyes\r\n      Though smoking hot from slut.\r\n         So a Tory I will be, etc.\r\n\r\n   Black cap turn’d up with white,\r\n      With wolfish neck and face,\r\n   And mouth with nonsense stuft,\r\n      Speaks Whig a man of grace,\r\n         And a Tory I will be, etc.\r\n\r\n   The sisters go to meetings\r\n      To meet their gallants

was safe,\r\n      When she lived a private Miss.\r\n         And a Tory I will be, etc.\r\n\r\n   The Whigs, though ne’er so proud,\r\n      Sometimes have been as low,\r\n   For there are some of note\r\n      Have long a raree-show.\r\n         And a Tory I will be, etc.\r\n\r\n   These mushrooms now have got\r\n      Their champion turn-coat hick;\r\n   But if the naked truth were known\r\n      They’re assisted by old Nick.\r\n         And a Tory I will be, etc.\r\n\r\n   To be and to be not\r\n      At once is in their power;\r\n   For when they’re in, they’re guilty,\r\n      But clear when out o’ the tower.\r\n         And a Tory I will be, etc.\r\n\r\n   To carry their designs,\r\n      Though ’t contradicts their sense;\r\n   They’re clear a Whiggish traytor\r\n      Against clear evidence.\r\n         And a Tory I will be, etc.\r\n\r\n   The old proverb doth us tell,\r\n      Each dog will have his day;\r\n   And Whig has had his too,\r\n      For which he’ll soundly pay;\r\n         And a Tory I will be, etc.\r\n\r\n   For bodkins and for thimbles\r\n      Now let your tubsters cant;\r\n   Their confounded tired cause\r\n      Had never yet more want.\r\n         So a Tory I will be, etc.\r\n\r\n   For ignoramus Toney\r\n      Has left you in the lurch;\r\n   And you have spent your money,\r\n      So, faith, e’en come to Church;\r\n         For a Tory I will be, etc.\r\n\r\n   They are of no religion,\r\n      Be it spoken to their glories,\r\n   For St Peter and St Paul\r\n      With them both are Tories;\r\n         And a Tory I will be, etc.\r\n\r\n   They’re excellent contrivers,\r\n      I wonder what they’re not,\r\n   For something they can make\r\n      Of nothing and a plot.\r\n         And a Tory I will be, etc.\r\n\r\n   But now your holy cheat\r\n      Is known throughout the nation;\r\n   And a Whig is known to be\r\n      A thing quite out of fashion.\r\n         And a Tory I will be, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW GAME AT CARDS:\r\nOR,\r\nWIN AT FIRST AND LOSE AT LAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nA popular ballad, written immediately after the restoration of Charles\r\nII.; and in which the victorious Cavaliers render honour to General Monk,\r\nDuke of Albemarle.\r\n\r\n                Tune, “Ye gallants that delight to play.”\r\n\r\n   YE merry hearts that love to play\r\n   At cards, see who hath won the day;\r\n   You that once did sadly sing\r\n   The knave of clubs hath won the king;\r\n   Now more happy times we have,\r\n   The king hath overcome the knave.\r\n\r\n   Not long ago a game was play’d,\r\n   When three crowns at the stakes were laid;\r\n   England had no cause to boast,\r\n   Knaves won that which kings had lost:\r\n   Coaches gave the way to carts,\r\n   And clubs were better cards than hearts.\r\n\r\n   Old Noll was the knave o’ clubs,\r\n   And dad of such as preach in tubs;\r\n   Bradshaw, Ireton, and Pride\r\n   Were three other knaves beside;\r\n   And they play’d with half the pack,\r\n   Throwing out all cards but black.\r\n\r\n   But the just Fates threw these four out,\r\n   Which made the loyal party shout;\r\n   The Pope would fain have had the stock,\r\n   And with these cards have whipt his dock.\r\n   But soon the Devil these cards snatches\r\n   To dip in brimstone, and make matches.\r\n\r\n   But still the sport for to maintain,\r\n   Bold Lambert, Haslerigg, and Vane,\r\n   With one-eyed Hewson, took their places,\r\n   Knaves were better cards than aces;\r\n   But Fleetwood he himself did save,\r\n   Because he was more fool than knave.\r\n\r\n   Cromwell, though he so much had won,\r\n   Yet he had an unlucky son;\r\n   He sits still, and not regards,\r\n   Whilst cunning gamesters set the cards;\r\n   And thus, alas! poor silly Dick,\r\n   He play’d awhile, and lost his trick.\r\n\r\n   The Rumpers that had won whole towns,\r\n   The spoils of martyrs and of crowns,\r\n   Were not contented, but grew rough,\r\n   As though they had not won enough;\r\n   They kept the cards still in their hands,\r\n   To play for tithes and college lands.\r\n\r\n   The Presbyters began to fret\r\n   That they were like to lose the sett;\r\n   Unto the Rump they did appeal,\r\n   And said it was their turn to deal;\r\n   Then dealt with Presbyterians, but\r\n   The army swore that they would cut.\r\n\r\n   The foreign lands began to wonder,\r\n   To see what gallants we lived under,\r\n   That they, which Christians did forswear,\r\n   Should follow gaming all the year,—\r\n   Nay more, which was the strangest thing,\r\n   To play so long without a king.\r\n\r\n   The bold phanatics present were,\r\n   Like butlers with their boxes there,\r\n   Not doubting but that every game\r\n   Some profit would redound to them;\r\n   Because they were the gamesters’ minions,\r\n   And every day broach’d new opinions.\r\n\r\n   But Cheshire men (as stories say)\r\n   Began to show them gamester’s play;\r\n   Brave Booth and all his army strives\r\n   To save the stakes, or lose their lives;\r\n   But, oh sad fate! they were undone\r\n   By playing of their cards too soon.\r\n\r\n   Thus all the while a club was trump,\r\n   There’s none could ever beat the Rump,\r\n   Until a noble general came,\r\n   And gave the cheaters a clear slam;\r\n   His finger did outwit their noddy,\r\n   And screw’d up poor Jack Lambert’s body.\r\n\r\n   Then Haslerigg began to scowl,\r\n   And said the general play’d foul.\r\n   Look to him, partners, for I tell ye,\r\n   This Monk has got a king in’s belly.\r\n   Not so, quoth Monk, but I believe\r\n   Sir Arthur has a knave in’s sleeve.\r\n\r\n   When General Monk did understand\r\n   The Rump were peeping into’s hand,\r\n   He wisely kept his cards from sight,\r\n   Which put the Rump into a fright;\r\n   He saw how many were betray’d\r\n   That show’d their cards before they play’d.\r\n\r\n   At length, quoth he, some cards we lack,\r\n   I will not play with half a pack;\r\n   What you cast out I will bring in,\r\n   And a new game we will begin:\r\n   With that the standers-by did say\r\n   They never yet saw fairer play.\r\n\r\n   But presently this game was past,\r\n   And for a second knaves were cast;\r\n   All new cards, not stain’d with spots,\r\n   As was the Rumpers and the Scots,—\r\n   Here good gamesters play’d their parts\r\n   And turn’d up the king of hearts.\r\n\r\n   After this game was done, I think\r\n   The standers-by had cause to drink,\r\n   And all loyal subjects sing,\r\n   Farewell knaves, and welcome King;\r\n   For, till we saw the King return’d,\r\n   We wish’d the cards had all been burn’d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAVALEERS LITANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n      (March 25th, 1660.)—From the King’s Pamphlets, British Museum.\r\n\r\n   FROM

British Museum,\r\nexpress the discontent of the Cavaliers at the ingratitude of King\r\nCharles to the old supporters of the fortunes of his family.—(March 15th,\r\n1660.)\r\n\r\n                   To the tune of “I tell thee, Dick.”\r\n\r\n   COME, Jack, let’s drink a pot of ale,\r\n   And I shall tell thee such a tale\r\n      Will make thine ears to ring;\r\n   My coyne is spent, my time is lost,\r\n   And I this only fruit can boast,\r\n      That once I saw my King.\r\n\r\n   But this doth most afflict my mind:\r\n   I went to Court in hope to find\r\n      Some of my friends in place;\r\n   And walking there, I had a sight\r\n   Of all the crew, but, by this light!\r\n      I hardly knew one face.\r\n\r\n   ’S’life! of so many noble sparkes,\r\n   Who on their bodies bear the markes\r\n      Of their integritie;\r\n   And suffer’d ruine of estate,\r\n   It was my damn’d unhappy fate\r\n      That I not one could see.\r\n\r\n   Not one, upon my life, among\r\n   My old acquaintance all along\r\n      At Truro and before;\r\n   And I suppose the place can show\r\n   As few of those whom thou didst know\r\n      At Yorke or Marston-moore.\r\n\r\n   But truly there are swarmes of those\r\n   Who lately were our chiefest foes,\r\n      Of pantaloons and muffes;\r\n   Whilst the old rusty Cavaleer\r\n   Retires, or dares not once appear,\r\n      For want of coyne and cuffes.\r\n\r\n   When none of these I could descry,\r\n   Who better far deserv’d then I,\r\n      Calmely I did reflect;\r\n   “Old services (by rule of State)\r\n   Like almanacks grow out of date,—\r\n      What then can I expect?”\r\n\r\n   Troth! in contempt of Fortune’s frown,\r\n   I’ll get me fairly out of town,\r\n      And in a cloyster pray;\r\n   That since the starres are yet unkind\r\n   To Royalists, the King may find\r\n      More faithfull friends than they.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ECHO TO THE CAVALIER’S COMPLAINT.\r\n\r\n\r\n   I MARVEL, Dick, that having been\r\n   So long abroad, and having seen\r\n      The world as thou hast done,\r\n   Thou should’st acquaint mee with a tale\r\n   As old as Nestor, and as stale\r\n      As that of Priest and Nunne. {100}\r\n\r\n   Are we to learn what is a Court?\r\n   A pageant made for fortune’s sport,\r\n      Where merits scarce appear;\r\n   For bashfull merit only dwells\r\n   In camps, in villages, and cells;\r\n      Alas! it dwells not there.\r\n\r\n   Desert is nice in its addresse,\r\n   And merit ofttimes doth oppresse\r\n      Beyond what guilt would do;\r\n   But they are sure of their demands\r\n   That come to Court with golden hands,\r\n      And brazen faces, too.\r\n\r\n   The King, they say, doth still professe\r\n   To give his party some redresse,\r\n      And cherish honestie;\r\n   But his good wishes prove in vain,\r\n   Whose service with his servants’ gain\r\n      Not alwayes doth agree.\r\n\r\n   All princes (be they ne’er so wise)\r\n   Are fain to see with others’ eyes,\r\n      But seldom hear at all;\r\n   And courtiers find their interest\r\n   In time to feather well their nest,\r\n      Providing for their fall.\r\n\r\n   Our comfort doth on time depend,\r\n   Things when they are at worst will mend;\r\n      And let us but reflect\r\n   On our condition th’ other day,\r\n   When none but tyrants bore the sway,\r\n      What did we then expect?\r\n\r\n   Meanwhile a calm retreat is best,\r\n   But discontent (if not supprest)\r\n      Will breed disloyaltie;\r\n   This is the constant note I sing,\r\n   I have been faithful to the King,\r\n      And so shall ever be.\r\n\r\nLondon, printed for Robert Crofts, at the Crown, in Chancery Lane, 1661.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA RELATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Ten grand infamous Traytors, who, for their horrid murder and\r\ndetestable villany against our late soveraigne Lord King Charles the\r\nFirst, that ever blessed martyr, were arraigned, tryed, and executed in\r\nthe moneth of October, 1660, which in perpetuity will be had in\r\nremembrance unto the world’s end.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the Six Ballads of the Restoration found in a trunk, and\r\nsent by Sir W. C. Trevelyan to the British Museum.  “No measure threw\r\nmore disgrace on the Restoration,” says Mr Wright, “than the prosecution\r\nof the regicides; and the heartless and sanguinary manner in which it was\r\nconducted tended more than any other circumstance to open the eyes of the\r\npeople to the real character of the government to which they had been\r\nbetrayed.”  Pepys observes on the 20th Oct., “A bloody week this and the\r\nlast have been; there being ten hanged, drawn, and quartered.”\r\n\r\n           The tune is “Come let us drinke, the time invites.”\r\n\r\n   HEE that can impose a thing,\r\n      And shew forth a reason\r\n   For what was done against the King,\r\n      From the palace to the prison;\r\n   Let him here with me recite,\r\n   For my pen is bent to write\r\n      The horrid facts of treason.\r\n\r\n   Since there is no learned scribe\r\n      Nor arithmaticion\r\n   Ever able to decide\r\n      The usurp’d base ambition,\r\n   Which in truth I shall declare,\r\n   Traytors here which lately were,\r\n      Who wanted a phisitian.\r\n\r\n   For the grand disease that bred\r\n      Nature could not weane it;\r\n   From the foot unto the head,\r\n      Was putrefacted treason in it;\r\n   Doctors could no cure give,\r\n   Which made the squire then beleeve\r\n      That he must first begin it.\r\n\r\n   And the phisick did compose,\r\n      Within a pound of reason;\r\n   First to take away the cause,\r\n      Then to purge away the treason,\r\n   With a dosse of hemp made up,\r\n   Wrought as thickly as a rope,\r\n      And given them in due season.\r\n\r\n   The doctors did prescribe at last\r\n      To give ’um this potation,\r\n   A vomit or a single cast,\r\n      Well deserved, in purgation;\r\n   After that to lay them downe,\r\n   And bleed a veine in every one,\r\n      As traytors of the nation.\r\n\r\n   So when first the physicke wrought,\r\n      The thirteenth of October, {101}\r\n   The patient on a sledge was brought,\r\n      Like a rebell and a rover,\r\n   To the execution tree;\r\n   Where with much dexterity\r\n      Was gently turned over.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND PART.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            To the same tune.\r\n\r\n   MONDAY was the fifteenth day,\r\n      As Carew then did follow, {102}\r\n   Of whom all men I thinke might say\r\n      In tyranny did deeply wallow;\r\n   Traytor proved unto the King,\r\n   Which made him on the gallowes swing,\r\n      And all the people hallow.\r\n\r\n   Tuesday, after Peters, Cooke, {103}\r\n      Two notorious traytors,\r\n   That brought our soveraigne to the blocke,\r\n      For which were hang’d and cut in quarters;\r\n   ’Twas Cooke which wrought the bloody thing\r\n   To draw the charge against our King,\r\n      That ever blessed martyr.\r\n\r\n   Next, on Wednesday, foure came,\r\n      For murthur all imputed,\r\n   There to answer for the same,\r\n      Which in judgement were confuted.\r\n   Gregorie Clement, Jones, and Scot,\r\n   And Scroop together, for a plot, {104}\r\n      Likewise were executed.\r\n\r\n   Thursday past, and Friday then,\r\n      To end the full conclusion,\r\n   And make the traytors just up ten,\r\n      That day were brought to execution,\r\n   Hacker and proud Axtell he, {105}\r\n   At Tyburne for their treachery\r\n      Received their absolution.\r\n\r\n   Being against the King and States,\r\n      The Commons all condemn’d ’um,\r\n   And their quarters on the gates\r\n      Hangeth for a memorandum\r\n   ’Twixt the heavens and the earth;\r\n   Traytors are so little worth,\r\n      To dust and smoake wee’l send ’um.\r\n\r\n   Let now October warning make\r\n      To bloody-minded traytors,\r\n   That never phisicke more they take,\r\n      For in this moneth they lost their quarters;\r\n   Being so against the King,\r\n   Which to murther they did bring,\r\n      The ever blessed martyr.\r\n\r\nLondon, printed for Fr.

BEING A BRIEF RELATION OF KING\r\nCHARLES’S ROYALL PROGRESSE FROM DOVER TO LONDON, HOW THE LORD GENERALL\r\nAND THE LORD MAYOR, WITH ALL THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY OF THE LAND, BROUGHT\r\nHIM THOROW THE FAMOUS CITY OF LONDON TO HIS PALLACE AT WESTMINSTER, THE\r\n29TH OF MAY LAST, BEING HIS MAJESTIES BIRTH-DAY, TO THE GREAT COMFORT OF\r\nHIS LOYALL SUBJECTS.\r\n\r\nOne of the six curious broadsides found by Sir W. C. Trevelyan in the\r\nlining of a trunk, and now in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nThe new Parliament met on the twenty-fifth of April, and on the first of\r\nMay the King’s letter from Breda was read, and the Restoration determined\r\nby a vote of the House.  The King immediately repaired to the coast, and,\r\nafter meeting with some obstruction from the roughness of the weather,\r\nwent on board the _Nazeby_ on the 23rd of May.  On the 25th he landed at\r\nDover.  He made his entry into London on the 29th.\r\n\r\n           To the tune of “When the King enjoys his own again.”\r\n\r\n   WHERE’S those that did prognosticate,\r\n   And did envy fair England’s state,\r\n   And said King Charles no more should reign?\r\n   Their predictions were but in vain,\r\n      For the King is now return’d,\r\n      For whom fair England mourn’d;\r\n   His nobles royally him entertain.\r\n      Now blessed be the day!\r\n      Thus do his subjects say,\r\n   That God hath brought him home again.\r\n\r\n   The twenty-second of lovely May\r\n   At Dover arrived, fame doth say,\r\n   Where our most noble generall\r\n   Did on his knees before him fall,\r\n      Craving to kiss his hand,\r\n      So soon as he did land.\r\n   Royally they did him entertain,\r\n      With all their pow’r and might,\r\n      To bring him to his right,\r\n   And place him in his own again.\r\n\r\n   Then the King, I understand,\r\n   Did kindly take him by the hand\r\n   And lovingly did him embrace,\r\n   Rejoycing for to see his face.\r\n      Hee lift him from the ground\r\n      With joy that did abound,\r\n   And graciously did him entertain;\r\n      Rejoycing that once more\r\n      He was o’ th’ English shore,\r\n   To enjoy his own in peace again.\r\n\r\n   From Dover to Canterbury they past,\r\n   And so to Cobham-hall at last;\r\n   From thence to London march amain,\r\n   With a triumphant and glorious train,\r\n      Where he was received with joy,\r\n      His sorrow to destroy,\r\n   In England once more for to raign;\r\n      Now all men do sing,\r\n      God save Charles our King,\r\n   That now enjoyes his own again.\r\n\r\n   At Deptford the maidens they\r\n   Stood all in white by the high-way\r\n   Their loyalty to Charles to show,\r\n   They with sweet flowers his way to strew.\r\n      Each wore a ribbin blew,\r\n      They were of comely hue,\r\n   With joy they did him entertain,\r\n      With acclamations to the skye\r\n      As the King passed by,\r\n   For joy that he receives his own again.\r\n\r\n   In Wallworth-fields a gallant band\r\n   Of London ’prentices did stand,\r\n   All in white dublets very gay,\r\n   To entertain King Charles that day,\r\n      With muskets, swords, and pike;\r\n      I never saw the like,\r\n   Nor a more youthfull gallant train;\r\n      They up their hats did fling,\r\n      And cry, “God save the King!\r\n   Now he enjoys his own again.”\r\n\r\n   At Newington-Buts the Lord Mayor willed\r\n   A famous booth for to be builded,\r\n   Where King Charles did make a stand,\r\n   And received the sword into his hand;\r\n      Which his Majesty did take,\r\n      And then returned back\r\n   Unto the Mayor with love again.\r\n      A banquet they him make,\r\n      He doth thereof partake,\r\n   Then marcht his triumphant train.\r\n\r\n   The King with all his noblemen,\r\n   Through Southwark they marched then;\r\n   First marched Major Generall Brown, {106}\r\n   Then Norwich Earle of great renown, {107}\r\n      With many a valiant knight\r\n      And gallant men of might,\r\n   Richly attired, marching amain,\r\n      There Lords Mordin, Gerard, and\r\n      The good Earle of Cleavland, {108}\r\n   To bring the King to his own again.\r\n\r\n   Near sixty flags and streamers then\r\n   Was born before a thousand men,\r\n   In plush coats and chaines of gold,\r\n   These were most rich for to behold;\r\n      With every man his page,\r\n      The glory of his age;\r\n   With courage bold they marcht amain,\r\n      Then with gladnesse they\r\n      Brought the King on his way\r\n   For to enjoy his own again.\r\n\r\n   Then Lichfields and Darbyes Earles, {109}\r\n   Two of fair England’s royall pearles;\r\n   Major Generall Massey then\r\n   Commanded the life guard of men,\r\n      The King for to defend,\r\n      If any should contend,\r\n   Or seem his comming to restrain;\r\n      But also joyfull were\r\n      That no such durst appear,\r\n   Now the King enjoyes his own again.\r\n\r\n   Four rich maces before them went,\r\n   And many heralds well content;\r\n   The Lord Mayor and the generall\r\n   Did march before the King withall.\r\n      His brothers on each side\r\n      Along by him did ride;\r\n   The Southwark-waits did play amain,\r\n      Which made them all to smile\r\n      And to stand still awhile,\r\n   And then they marched on again.\r\n\r\n   Then with drawn swords all men did side,\r\n   And flourishing the same, then cryed,\r\n   “Charles the Second now God save,\r\n   That he his lawfull right may have!\r\n      And we all on him attend,\r\n      From dangers him to defend,\r\n   And all that with him doth remain.\r\n      Blessed be God that we\r\n      Did live these days to see,\r\n   That the King enjoyes his own again!”\r\n\r\n   The bells likewise did loudly ring,\r\n   Bonefires did burn and people sing;\r\n   London conduits did run with wine,\r\n   And all men do to Charles incline;\r\n      Hoping now that all\r\n      Unto their trades may fall,\r\n   Their famylies for to maintain,\r\n      And from wrong be free,\r\n      ’Cause we have liv’d to

POLITICAL\r\nPROCEEDINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Noble Progresse, or a True Relation of the Lord General Monk’s\r\nPolitical Proceedings with the Rump, the calling in the secluded Members,\r\ntheir transcendant vote for his sacred Majesty, with his reception at\r\nDover, and royal conduct through the City of London to his famous Palace\r\nat Whitehall.  One of the broadsides in the British Museum, found in the\r\nlining of an old trunk by Sir W. C. Trevelyan.\r\n\r\n                Tune—“When first the Scottish wars began.”\r\n\r\n      GOOD people, hearken to my call,\r\n      I’le tell you all what did befall\r\n         And hapned of late;\r\n      Our noble valiant General Monk\r\n      Came to the Rump, who lately stunk\r\n         With their council of state.\r\n   Admiring what this man would doe,\r\n   His secret mind there’s none could know,\r\n   They div’d into him as much as they could,—\r\n   George would not be won with their silver nor gold:\r\n   The sectarian saints at this lookt blew,\r\n   With all the rest of the factious crew,\r\n   They vapour’d awhile, and were in good hope,\r\n   But now they have nothing left but the rope.\r\n\r\n      Another invention then they sought,\r\n      Which long they wrought for to be brought\r\n         To claspe him with they;\r\n      Quoth Vane and Scot, I’le tell you what,\r\n      Wee’l have a plot and he shall not,\r\n         Wee’l carry the sway:\r\n   Let’s vote him a thousand pound a yeare,\r\n   And Hampton Court for him and his Heire.\r\n   Indeed, quoth George, ye’re Free Parliament men\r\n   To cut a thong out of another man’s skin.\r\n      The sectarian, etc.\r\n\r\n      They sent him then with all his hosts\r\n      To break our posts and raise our ghosts,\r\n         Which was their intent;\r\n      To cut our gates and chain all downe\r\n      Unto the ground—this trick they found\r\n         To make him be shent:\r\n   This plot the Rump did so accord\r\n   To cast an odium on my lord,\r\n   But in the task he was hard put untoo’t,\r\n   ’Twas enough to infect both his horse and his foot,\r\n      The sectarian, etc.\r\n\r\n      But when my lord perceived that night\r\n      What was their spight, he brought to light\r\n         Their knaveries all;\r\n      This Parliament of forty-eight,\r\n      Which long did wait, came to him straight,\r\n         To give them a fall,\r\n   And some phanatical people knew\r\n   That George would give them their fatall due;\r\n   Indeed he did requite them agen,\r\n   For he pul’d the Monster out of his den.\r\n      The sectarian, etc.\r\n\r\n      To the House our worthy Parliament\r\n      With good intent they boldly went\r\n         To vote home the King,\r\n      And many hundred people more\r\n      Stood at the doore, and waited for\r\n         Good tidings to bring;\r\n   Yet some in the House had their hands much in blood,\r\n   And in great opposition like traytors they stood;\r\n   But yet I believe it is very well known\r\n   That those that were for him were twenty to one.\r\n      But the sectarian, etc.\r\n\r\n      They call’d the League and Covenant in\r\n      To read again to every man;\r\n         But what comes next?\r\n      All sequestrations null be void,\r\n      The people said none should be paid,\r\n         For this was the text.\r\n   For, as I heard all the people say,\r\n   They voted King Charles the first of May;\r\n   Bonfires burning, bells did ring,\r\n   And our streets did echo with God bless ye King.\r\n      At this the sectarian, etc.\r\n\r\n      Our general then to Dover goes,\r\n      In spite of foes or deadly blowes,\r\n         Saying Vive le Roy;\r\n      And all the glories of the land,\r\n      At his command they there did stand\r\n         In triumph and joy.\r\n   Good Lord, what a sumptuous sight ’twas to see\r\n   Our good Lord General fall on his knee\r\n   To welcome home his Majestie,\r\n   And own his sacred sovereignty.\r\n      But the sectarian, etc.\r\n\r\n      When all the worthy noble train\r\n      Came back again with Charlemain,\r\n         Our sovereign great:\r\n      The Lord Mayor in his scarlet gown,\r\n      His chain so long, went through the town\r\n         In pompe and state.\r\n   The livery-men each line the way\r\n   Upon this great triumphant day;\r\n   Five rich maces carried before,\r\n   And my Lord himselfe the sword he bore.\r\n   Then Vive le Roy the gentry did sing,\r\n   For General Monk rode next to the King;\r\n   With acclamations, shouts, and cryes,\r\n   I thought they would have rent the skyes.\r\n\r\n      The conduits, ravished with joy,\r\n      As I may say, did run all day\r\n         Great plenty of wine;\r\n      And every gentleman of note\r\n      In’s velvet coat that could be got\r\n         In glory did shine.\r\n   There were all the peeres and barrons bold,\r\n   Richly clad in silver and gold,\r\n   Marched through the street so brave,\r\n   No greater pompe a king could have.\r\n      At this,

Brome.\r\n\r\n   OLD England is now a brave Barbary made,\r\n      And every one has an ambition to ride her;\r\n   King Charles was a horseman that long used the trade,\r\n      But he rode in a snaffle, and that could not guide her.\r\n\r\n   Then the hungry Scot comes with spur and with switch,\r\n      And would teach her to run a Geneva career;\r\n   His grooms were all Puritan, Traytor, and Witch,\r\n      But she soon threw them down with their pedlary geer.\r\n\r\n   The Long Parliament next came all to the block,\r\n      And they this untameable palfrey would ride;\r\n   But she would not bear all that numerous flock,\r\n      At which they were fain themselves to divide.\r\n\r\n   Jack Presbyter first gets the steed by the head,\r\n      While the reverend Bishops had hold of the bridle;\r\n   Jack said through the nose they their flockes did not feed,\r\n      But sat still on the beast and grew aged and idle.\r\n\r\n   And then comes the Rout, with broom-sticks inspired,\r\n      And pull’d down their graces, their sleeves, and their train;\r\n   And sets up Sir Jack, who the beast quickly tyr’d\r\n      With a journey to Scotland and thence back again.\r\n\r\n   Jack rode in a doublet, with a yoke of prick-ears,\r\n      A cursed splay-mouth and a Covenant spur,\r\n   Rides switching and spurring with jealousies and fears,\r\n      Till the poor famish’d beast was not able to stir.\r\n\r\n   Next came th’ Independent—a dev’lish designer,\r\n      And got himself call’d by a holier name—\r\n   Makes Jack to unhorse, for he was diviner,\r\n      And would make her travel as far’s Amsterdam.\r\n\r\n   But Nol, a rank-rider, gets first in the saddle,\r\n      And made her show tricks, and curvate, and rebound;\r\n   She quickly perceived that he rode widdle waddle,\r\n      And like his coach-horses threw his Highness to ground.\r\n\r\n   Then Dick, being lame, rode holding by the pummel,\r\n      Not having the wit to get hold of the rein;\r\n   But the jade did so snort at the sight of a Cromwell,\r\n      That poor Dick and his kindred turn’d footmen again.\r\n\r\n   Next Fleetwood and Vane with their rascally pack,\r\n      Would every one put their feet in the stirrup;\r\n   But they pull’d the saddle quite off of her back,\r\n      And were all got under her before they were up.\r\n\r\n   At last the King mounts her, and then she stood still;\r\n      As his Bucephalus, proud of this rider,\r\n   She cheerfully yields to his power and skill\r\n      Who is careful to feed her, and skilful to guide her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CATCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       By Alex.

Butler’s ballad, though unpublished, must therefore have\r\nbeen known at the time.\r\n\r\n                 To the tune of “London is a fine town.”\r\n\r\n   I LOVED no King since forty-one,\r\n      When Prelacy went down;\r\n   A cloak and band I then put on\r\n      And preach’d against the crown.\r\n   A turn-coat is a cunning man\r\n      That cants to admiration,\r\n   And prays for any king to gain\r\n      The people’s approbation.\r\n\r\n   I show’d the paths to heaven untrod,\r\n      From Popery to refine ’em,\r\n   And taught the people to serve God,\r\n      As if the Devil were in ’em.\r\n         A turn-coat, etc.\r\n\r\n   When Charles return’d into our land,\r\n      The English Church supporter,\r\n   I shifted off my cloak and band,\r\n      And so became a courtier.\r\n         A turn-coat, etc.\r\n\r\n   The King’s religion I profest,\r\n      And found there was no harm in ’t;\r\n   I cogg’d and flatter’d like the rest,\r\n      Till I had got preferment.\r\n         A turn-coat, etc.\r\n\r\n   I taught my conscience how to cope\r\n      With honesty or evil;\r\n   And when I rail’d against the Pope\r\n      I sided with the Devil.\r\n         A turn-coat, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLARET DRINKER’S SONG,\r\nOR\r\nTHE GOOD FELLOW’S DESIGN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing a pleasant song of the times, written by a person of quality.—From\r\nthe Roxburgh Ballads, Vol. iii.\r\n\r\n   Wine the most powerfull’st of all things on earth,\r\n   Which stifles cares and sorrows in their birth;\r\n   No treason in it harbours, nor can hate\r\n   Creep in when it bears away, to hurt the State.\r\n   Though storms grow high, so wine is to be got,\r\n   We are secure, their rage we value not;\r\n   The Muses cherish’d up such nectar, sing\r\n   Eternal joy to him that loves the King.\r\n\r\n                  To the tune of “Let Cæsar live long.”\r\n\r\n   A POX of the fooling and plotting of late,\r\n   What a pudder and stir has it kept in the State!\r\n   Let the rabble run mad with suspicions and fears,\r\n   Let ’em scuffle and rail till they go by the ears,—\r\n   Their grievances never shall trouble my pate,\r\n   So I but enjoy my dear bottle at quiet.\r\n\r\n   What coxcombs were those that would ruin their case\r\n   And their necks for a toy, a thin wafer, and mass!\r\n   For at Tyburn they never had needed to swing\r\n   Had they been but true subjects to drink and their King:\r\n   A friend and a bottle is all my design,—\r\n   He’s no room for treason that’s top-full of wine.\r\n\r\n   I mind not the members and makers of laws,\r\n   Let them sit or prorogue as his Majesty please;\r\n   Let ’em damn us to Woolen, I’le never repine\r\n   At my usage when dead, so alive I have wine;\r\n   Yet oft in my drink I can hardly forbear\r\n   To blame them for making my claret so dear.\r\n\r\n   I mind not grave allies who idly debate\r\n   About rights and successions, the trifles of State;\r\n   We’ve a good King already, and he deserves laughter\r\n   That will trouble his head with who shall come after:\r\n   Come, here’s to his health!

for his loyalty was put to flight.\r\n\r\n   But had he a haid of hair like Absolom,\r\n   And every hair as strong as was Samson,\r\n   I’d venture all for Charles the Second’s sake,\r\n   And for

sadness,\r\n   And now with heart and voice\r\n      Show forth your gladness.\r\n   That to King Charles were true\r\n      And rebels hated,\r\n   This song only to you\r\n      Is dedicated;\r\n   For Charles our sovereign dear\r\n      Is safe returned\r\n   True subjects’ hearts to cheer,\r\n      That long have mourned:\r\n   Then let us give God praise\r\n      That doth defend him,\r\n   And pray with heart and voice,\r\n      Angels, attend him.\r\n\r\n   The dangers he hath past\r\n      From vile usurpers\r\n   Now bring him joy at last,\r\n      Although some lurkers\r\n   Did seek his blood to spill\r\n      By actions evil;\r\n   But God we see is still\r\n      Above the Devil:\r\n   Though many serpents hiss\r\n      Him to devour,\r\n   God his defender is\r\n      By His strong power:\r\n   Then let us give him praise\r\n      That doth defend him,\r\n   And sing with heart and voice,\r\n      Angels, defend him.\r\n\r\n   The joy that he doth bring,\r\n      If true confessed,\r\n   The tongues of mortal men\r\n      Cannot confess it;\r\n   He cures our drooping fears,\r\n      Being long tormented,\r\n   And his true Cavaliers\r\n      Are well contented;\r\n   For now the Protestant\r\n      Again shall flourish;\r\n   The King our nursing father\r\n      He will us cherish:\r\n   Then let us give God praise\r\n      That did defend

converted;\r\n   But, like the Israelites,\r\n      There are a number\r\n   That for his love to them\r\n      ’Gainst him doth murmur:\r\n   Read Exodus,—’tis true\r\n      The Israelites rather\r\n   Yield to the Egyptian crew\r\n      Than Moses their father:\r\n   So many phanaticks,\r\n      With hearts disloyal,\r\n   Their hearts and minds do fix\r\n      ’Gainst our King royal.\r\n\r\n                               SECOND PART.\r\n\r\n   LIKE holy David, he\r\n      Past many troubles,\r\n   And by his constancy\r\n      His joys redoubles;\r\n   For now he doth bear sway\r\n      By God appointed,\r\n   For Holy Writ doth say,\r\n      Touch not mine Anointed.\r\n   He is God’s anointed sure,\r\n      Who still doth guide him\r\n   In all his wayes most pure,\r\n      Though some divide him.\r\n   Then let us give God praise\r\n      That doth defend him,\r\n   And sing with heart and voice,\r\n      Angels, attend him.\r\n\r\n   Many there are, we know,\r\n      Within this nation,\r\n   Lip-love to him do show\r\n      In ’simulation;\r\n   Of such vile hereticks\r\n      There are a number,\r\n   Whose hearts and tongues, we know,\r\n      Are far asunder;\r\n   Some do pray for the King\r\n      Being constrained;\r\n   Who lately against him\r\n      Greatly complained;\r\n   They turn both seat and seam\r\n      To cheat poor tailors,\r\n   But the fit place for them\r\n      Is under strong jailors.\r\n\r\n   Let the King’s foes admire\r\n      Who do reject him;\r\n   Seeing God doth him inspire,\r\n      And still direct him,\r\n   To heal those evil sores,\r\n      And them to cure\r\n   By his most gracious hand\r\n      And prayers pure.\r\n   Though simple people say\r\n      Doctors do as much,\r\n   None but our lawful King\r\n      Can cure with a touch;\r\n   As plainly hath been seen\r\n      Since he returned,—\r\n   Many have cured been\r\n      Which long have mourned.\r\n\r\n   The poorest wretch that hath\r\n      This evil, sure\r\n   May have ease from the King\r\n      And perfect cure;\r\n   His Grace is meek and wise,\r\n      Loving and civil,\r\n   And to his enemies\r\n      Doth good for evil;\r\n   For some that were his foes\r\n      Were by him healed;\r\n   His liberal cause to bless\r\n      Is not concealed;\r\n   He heals both poor and rich\r\n      By God’s great power,\r\n   And his most gracious touch\r\n      Doth them all cure.\r\n\r\n   Then blush, you infidels,\r\n      That late did scorn him;\r\n   And you that did rebel,\r\n      Crave pardon of him;\r\n   With speed turn a new leaf\r\n      For your transgresses;\r\n   Hear what the preacher sayes\r\n      In Ecclesiastes,—\r\n   The Scripture’s true, and shall\r\n      Ever be taught;\r\n   Curse not the King at all,\r\n      No, not in thy thought:\r\n   And holy Peter\r\n      Two commandments doth bring,—\r\n   Is first for to fear God,\r\n      And then honour the King.\r\n\r\n   When that we had no King\r\n      To guide the nation,\r\n   Opinions up did spring\r\n      By toleration;\r\n   And many heresies\r\n      Were then advanced,\r\n   And cruel liberties\r\n      By old Noll granted.\r\n   Even able ministers\r\n      Were not esteemed;\r\n   Many false prophets\r\n      Good preachers were deemed.\r\n   The Church some hated;\r\n      A barn, house, or stable\r\n   Would serve the Quakers,\r\n      With their wicked rabble.\r\n\r\n   And now for to conclude:\r\n      The God of power\r\n   Preserve and guide our King\r\n      Both day and hour;\r\n   That he may rule and reign\r\n      Our hearts to cherish;\r\n   And on his head, good Lord,\r\n      Let his crown flourish.\r\n   Let his true subjects sing\r\n      With hearts most loyal,\r\n   God bless and prosper still\r\n      Charles our King royal.\r\n   So now let’s give God praise\r\n      That doth defend him,\r\n   And sing with heart and voice,\r\n      Angels defend him.\r\n\r\nLondon, printed for John Andrews, at

Mr\r\nChappell states—“As this consists of only two stanzas, and the copy of\r\nthe book, which is now in the possession of Mr Payne Collier, is probably\r\nunique, they are here subjoined.”\r\n\r\n   LET every man with tongue and pen\r\n   Rejoice that Charles is come agen,\r\n   To gain his sceptre and his throne,\r\n   And give to every man his own;\r\n         Let all men that be\r\n         Together agree,\r\n   And freely now express their joy;\r\n         Let your sweetest voices bring\r\n         Pleasant songs unto the King,\r\n   To crown his Coronation Day.\r\n\r\n   All that do thread on English earth\r\n   Shall live in freedom, peace, and mirth;\r\n   The golden times are come that we\r\n   Did one day think we ne’er should see;\r\n         Protector and Rump\r\n         Did put us in a dump,\r\n   When they their colours did display;\r\n         But the time is come about,\r\n         We are in, and they are out,\r\n   By King Charles his Coronation Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KING ENJOYS HIS OWN AGAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   (1661.)—From Hogg’s Jacobite Relics.\r\n\r\n   WHIGS are now such precious things,\r\n      We see there’s not one to be found;\r\n   All roar “God bless and save the King!”\r\n      And his health goes briskly all day round.\r\n   To the soldier, cap in hand, the sneaking rascals stand,\r\n      And would put in for honest men;\r\n   But the King he well knows his friends from his foes,\r\n      And now he enjoys his own again.\r\n\r\n   From this plot’s first taking air,\r\n      Like lightning all the Whigs have run;\r\n   Nay, they’ve left their topping square,\r\n      To march off with our eldest son:\r\n   They’ve left their ’states and wives to save their precious lives,\r\n      Yet who can blame their flying, when\r\n   ’Twas plain to them all, the great and the small,\r\n      That the King would have his own again?\r\n\r\n   This may chance a warning be\r\n      (If e’er the saints will warning take)\r\n   To leave off hatching villany,\r\n      Since they’ve seen their brother at the stake:\r\n   And more must mounted be (which God grant we may see),\r\n      Since juries now are honest men:\r\n   And the King lets them swing with a hey ding a ding,\r\n      Great James enjoys his own again.\r\n\r\n   Since they have voted that his Guards\r\n      A nuisance were, which now they find,\r\n   Since they stand between the King\r\n      And the treason that such dogs design’d;\r\n   ’Tis they will you maul, though it cost them a fall,\r\n      In spight of your most mighty men;\r\n   For now they are alarm’d, and all Loyalists well arm’d,\r\n      Since the King enjoys his own again.\r\n\r\n   To the King, come, bumpers round,\r\n      Let’s drink, my boys, while life doth last:\r\n   He that at the core’s not sound\r\n      Shall be kick’d out without a taste.\r\n   We’ll fear no disgrace, but look traitors in the face,\r\n      Since we’re case-harden’d, honest men;\r\n   Which makes their crew mad, but us loyal hearts full glad,\r\n      That the King enjoys his own again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA COUNTRY SONG, INTITULED THE RESTORATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  (May, 1661.)—From the twentieth volume of the folio broadsides, King’s\r\n                                Pamphlets.\r\n\r\n      COME, come away\r\n      To the temple, and pray,\r\n   And sing with a pleasant strain;\r\n      The schismatick’s dead,\r\n      The liturgy’s read,\r\n   And the King enjoyes his own again.\r\n\r\n      The vicar is glad,\r\n      The clerk is not sad,\r\n   And the parish cannot refrain\r\n      To leap and rejoyce\r\n      And lift up their voyce,\r\n   That the King enjoyes his own again.\r\n\r\n      The country doth bow\r\n      To old justices now,\r\n   That long aside have been lain;\r\n      The bishop’s restored,\r\n      God is rightly adored,\r\n   And the King enjoyes his own again.\r\n\r\n      Committee-men fall,\r\n      And majors-generall,\r\n   No more doe those tyrants reign;\r\n      There’s no sequestration,\r\n      Nor new decimation,\r\n   For the King enjoyes the sword again.\r\n\r\n      The scholar doth look\r\n      With joy on his book,\r\n   Tom whistles and plows amain;\r\n      Soldiers plunder no more\r\n      As they did heretofore,\r\n   For the King enjoyes the sword again.\r\n\r\n      The citizens trade,\r\n      The merchants do lade,\r\n   And send their ships into Spain;\r\n      No pirates at sea\r\n      To make them a prey,\r\n   For the King enjoyes the sword again.\r\n\r\n      The old man and boy,\r\n      The clergy and lay,\r\n   Their joyes cannot contain;\r\n      ’Tis better than of late\r\n      With the Church and the State,\r\n   Now the King enjoyes the sword again.\r\n\r\n      Let’s render our praise\r\n      For these happy dayes\r\n   To God and our sovereign;\r\n      Your drinking give ore,\r\n      Swear not as before,\r\n   For the King bears not the sword in vain.\r\n\r\n      Fanaticks, be quiet,\r\n      And keep a good diet,\r\n   To cure your crazy brain;\r\n      Throw off your disguise,\r\n      Go to church and be wise,\r\n   For the King bears not the sword in vain.\r\n\r\n      Let faction and pride\r\n      Be now laid aside,\r\n   That truth and peace may reign;\r\n      Let every one mend,\r\n      And there is an end,\r\n   For the King bears not the sword in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE’S A HEALTH UNTO HIS MAJESTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is only one verse to this Song.  The music is arranged for three\r\nvoices in “Playford’s Musical Companion, 1667.”\r\n\r\n   HERE’S a health unto his Majesty,\r\n      With a fal la la la la la la,\r\n   Confusion to his enemies,\r\n      With a fal lal la la la la la la.\r\n   And he that will not drink his health,\r\n      I wish him neither wit nor wealth,\r\n   Nor but a rope to hang himself.\r\n      With a fal lal la la la la la la la la,\r\n      With a fal lal la la la la la.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHIGS DROWNED IN AN HONEST TORY HEALTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        From Col. 180 Loyal Songs.\r\n\r\n                Tune, “Hark, the thundering canons roar.”\r\n\r\n   WEALTH breeds care, love, hope, and fear;\r\n   What does love or bus’ness here?\r\n   While Bacchus’ navy doth appear,\r\n      Fight on and fear not sinking;\r\n   Fill it briskly to the brim,\r\n   Till the flying top-sails swim,\r\n   We owe the first discovery to him\r\n      Of this great world of drinking.\r\n\r\n   Brave Cabals, who states refine,\r\n   Mingle their debates with wine,\r\n   Ceres and the god o’ th’ vine\r\n      Make every great commander;\r\n   Let sober Scots small beer subdue,\r\n   The wise and valiant wine do woo,\r\n   The Stagerite had the horrors too,\r\n      To be drunk with Alexander.\r\n\r\n   _Stand to your arms_! and now advance,\r\n   A health to the English King of France;\r\n   And to the next of boon esperance,\r\n      By Bacchus and Apollo;\r\n   Thus in state I lead the van,\r\n   Fall in your place by the right-hand man,\r\n   Beat drum! march on! dub a dub, ran dan!\r\n      He’s a Whig that will not follow.\r\n\r\n   Face about to the right again,\r\n   Britain’s admiral of the main,\r\n   York and his illustrious train\r\n      Crown the day’s conclusion;\r\n   Let a halter stop his throat\r\n   Who brought in the foremost vote,\r\n   And of all that did promote\r\n      The mystery of exclusion.\r\n\r\n   Next to Denmark’s warlike prince\r\n   Let the following health commence,\r\n   To the nymph whose influence\r\n      That brought the hero hither;—\r\n   May their race the tribe annoy,\r\n   Who the Grandsire would destroy,\r\n   And get every year a boy\r\n      Whilst they live together.\r\n\r\n   To the royal family\r\n   Let us close in bumpers three,\r\n   May the ax and halter be\r\n      The pledge of every Roundhead;\r\n   To all loyal hearts pursue,\r\n   Who to the monarch dare prove true;\r\n   But for him they call True Blue,\r\n      Let him be confounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAVALIER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        By Alex.

Not\r\nmany weeks before the date of the present ballad, a prose tract had been\r\npublished, with the same title, “The Lamentation of a Bad Market, or\r\nKnaves and Fools foully foyled, and fallen into a Pit of their own\r\ndigging,” &c.  March 21st, 1659–60.\r\n\r\n      IN red-coat raggs attired,\r\n         I wander up and down,\r\n      Since fate and foes conspired,\r\n               Thus to array me,\r\n            Or betray me\r\n         To the harsh censure of the town.\r\n   My buffe doth make me boots, my velvet coat and scarlet,\r\n   Which used to do me credit with many a wicked harlot,\r\n   Have bid me all adieu, most despicable varlet!\r\n      Alas, poor souldier, whither wilt thou march?\r\n\r\n      I’ve been in France and Holland,\r\n         Guided by my starrs;\r\n      I’ve been in Spain and Poland,\r\n               I’ve been in Hungarie,\r\n            In Greece and Italy,\r\n         And served them in all their wars.\r\n   Britain these eighteen years has known my desperate slaughter,\r\n   I’ve killed ten at one blow, even in a fit of laughter,\r\n   Gone home again and smiled, and kiss’d my landlor’s daughter;\r\n      Alas! poor souldier, etc.\r\n\r\n      My valour prevailed,\r\n         Meeting with my foes,\r\n      Which strongly we assailed;\r\n               Oh! strange I wondred,\r\n            They were a hundred;\r\n         Yet I routed them with few blowes.\r\n   This fauchion by my side has kind more men, I’ll swear it,\r\n   Than Ajax ever did, alas!

poor souldier, etc.\r\n\r\n      I did about this nation\r\n         Hold forth my gifts and teach,\r\n      Maintained the tolleration\r\n               The common story\r\n            And Directory\r\n         I damn’d with the word “preach.”\r\n   Time was when all trades failed, men counterfeitly zealous\r\n   Turn’d whining, snievling praters, or kept a country ale-house,\r\n   Got handsome wives, turn’d cuckolds, howe’er were very jealous.\r\n      Alas! poor souldier, etc.\r\n\r\n      The world doth know me well,\r\n         I ne’re did peace desire,\r\n      Because I could not tell\r\n               Of what behaviour\r\n            I should savour\r\n         In a field of thundring fire.\r\n   When we had murdered King, confounded Church and State,\r\n   Divided parks and forests, houses, money, plate,\r\n   We then did peace desire, to keep what he had gat.\r\n      Alas! poor souldier, etc.\r\n\r\n      Surplice was surplisage,\r\n         We voted right or wrong,\r\n      Within that furious age,\r\n               Of the painted glass,\r\n            Or pictured brass,\r\n         And liturgie we made a song.\r\n   Bishops, and bishops’ lands, were superstitious words,\r\n   Until in souldiers’ hands, and so were kings and lords,\r\n   But in fashion now again in spight of all our swords.\r\n      Alas! poor souldier, etc.\r\n\r\n      Some say I am forsaken\r\n         By the great men of these times,\r\n      And they’re no whit mistaken;\r\n               It is my fate\r\n            To be out of date,\r\n         My masters most are guilty of such crimes.\r\n   Like an old Almanack, I now but represent\r\n   How long since Edge-Hill fight, or the rising was in Kent,\r\n   Or since the dissolution of the first Long Parliament.\r\n      Alas!

From such as do, etc.\r\n\r\n   Then come, again fill round our glass,\r\n   And, loyal Tories, less it pass,\r\n   Fill up, fill up unto the brim,\r\n   And let each boule with necture swim,\r\n            And let each boule, etc.\r\n\r\n   Though _cloakmen_, that seem much precise,\r\n   ’Gainst wine exclaim with turn’d-up eyes;\r\n   Yet in a corner they’l be drunk,\r\n   With drinking healths unto the Rump,\r\n            With drinking, etc.\r\n\r\n   In hopes that once more they shall tear\r\n   Both Church and State, which is their prayer;\r\n   But Heaven does yet protect the

favour does remain,\r\n   In spight of all the Whiggish train,\r\n            In spight of all, etc.\r\n\r\n   And now the _Old Cause_ goes to wrack,\r\n   Sedition mauger cloath in black\r\n   Do greatly dread the triple tree,\r\n   Whilst we rejoyce in loyalty,\r\n            Whilst we rejoyce, etc.\r\n\r\n   Then come, let’s take another round,\r\n   And still in loyalty abound,\r\n   And

commotion,\r\n      Their plotting and swearing shall prosper no more;\r\n   Now gallant old Jamie commands on the ocean,\r\n      And mighty Charles keeps them in awe on the shore.\r\n\r\n   Jamie the Valiant, the Champion Royal,\r\n      His own and the monarchy’s rival withstood;\r\n   The bane and the terror of those the disloyal,\r\n      Who slew his loved father and thirst for his blood.\r\n\r\n   York, the great admiral,—Ocean’s defender,\r\n      The joy of our navy, the dread of its foes,\r\n   The lawful successor,—what upstart pretender\r\n      Shall dare, in our isle, the true heir to oppose?\r\n\r\n   Jamie quelled the proud foe on the ocean,\r\n      And rode the sole conqueror over the main;\r\n   To this gallant hero let all pay devotion,\r\n      For England her admiral sees him again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNFORTUNATE WHIGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     1682.—From the Roxburgh Ballads.\r\n\r\n              To the tune of “The King enjoys his own,” &c.\r\n\r\n   THE Whigs are but small, and of no good race,\r\n      And are beloved by very few;\r\n   Old _Tony_ broach’d his tap in every place,\r\n      To encourage all his factious crew.\r\n         At some great houses in this town,\r\n         The Whigs of high renown,\r\n   And all with a true blue was their stain;\r\n         For since it is so,\r\n         They have wrought their overthrow,\r\n   Old Tony _will ne’r enjoy his own_, _again_.\r\n\r\n   They all owne duty to their lawful prince,\r\n      And loyal subjects should have been;\r\n   But their duty is worn out long since,\r\n      By the _Association_ seen.\r\n         But these are the Whigs,\r\n         That have cut off some legs,\r\n   And fain would be at that sport amain;\r\n         For since it is so,\r\n         They have wrought their overthrow,\r\n   Old Tony _will ne’r enjoy his own again_.\r\n\r\n   And yet they are sham-pretenders,\r\n      And they swear they’ll support our laws;\r\n   These be the great defenders of\r\n      _Ignoramus_ and the _Old Cause_:\r\n         They’ll defend the King\r\n         By swearing of the thing,\r\n   These are the cursed rogues in grain;\r\n         For since it is so,\r\n         They have wrought their overthrow,\r\n   Old Tony _will ne’r enjoy his own again_.\r\n\r\n   The true religion that shall down,\r\n      Which so long has won the day,\r\n   And _Common-prayer_ i’th’ church of ev’ry town,\r\n      If that the Whigs could but bear the sway:\r\n         For Oates he does begin\r\n         Now for to bring them in,\r\n   As when he came mumping from Spain;\r\n         For since it is so,\r\n         They have wrought their overthrow,\r\n   Old Tony _will ne’r enjoy his own again_.\r\n\r\n   How all their shamming plots they would hide,\r\n      Yet they are ignorant, they say,\r\n   When as Old _Tony_ he was try’d\r\n      And brought off with _Ignoramus_ sway:\r\n         When Oates he was dumb\r\n         And could not use his tongue,\r\n   This is the shamming rogues in grain;\r\n         For since it is so,\r\n         They have wrought their overthrow,\r\n   Old Tony _will ne’r enjoy his own again_.\r\n\r\n   Then let all true subjects sing,\r\n      And damn the power of all those\r\n   That won’t show loyalty to their King,\r\n      And assist him against his Whiggish foes.\r\n         Then in this our happy state,\r\n         In spight of traytors’ hate,\r\n   We will all loyal still remain;\r\n         For since it is so,\r\n         They have wrought their overthrow,\r\n   Old Tony _will ne’r enjoy his own again_.\r\n\r\n   God preserve our gracious King,\r\n      With the Royal Consort of his bed,\r\n   And let all loyal subjects sing\r\n      That the crown may remain on Charles’s head;\r\n         For we will drink his health\r\n         In spight of _Common-wealth_,\r\n   And his lawful rights we will maintain;\r\n         For since it is so,\r\n         They have wrought their overthrow,\r\n   Old Tony _will ne’r enjoy his own again_.\r\n\r\n                 Printed for S.

This is a\r\nparody on the Whig song, “Young Jemmy is a lad that’s royally descended,”\r\nwritten in celebration of the Duke of Monmouth.  Old Jemmy is the Duke of\r\nYork, afterwards James II.\r\n\r\n                      To the tune of “Young Jemmy.”\r\n\r\n   OLD Jemmy is a lad\r\n      Right lawfully descended;\r\n   No bastard born nor bred,\r\n      Nor for a Whig suspended;\r\n   The true and lawful heir to th’ crown\r\n      By right of birth and laws,\r\n   And bravely will maintain his own\r\n      In spight of all his foes.\r\n\r\n   Old Jemmy is the top\r\n      And chief among the princes;\r\n   No _Mobile_ gay fop,\r\n      With Birmingham pretences;\r\n   A heart and soul so wondrous great,\r\n      And such a conquering eye,\r\n   That every loyal lad fears not\r\n      In Jemmy’s cause to die.\r\n\r\n   Old Jemmy is a prince\r\n      Of noble resolutions,\r\n   Whose powerful influence\r\n      Can order our confusions;\r\n   But oh! he fights with such a grace\r\n      No force can him withstand,\r\n   No god of war but must give place\r\n      When Jemmy leads the van.\r\n\r\n   To Jemmy every swain\r\n      Does pay due veneration,\r\n   And Scotland does maintain\r\n      His title to the nation;\r\n   The pride of all the court he stands,\r\n      The patron of his cause,\r\n   The joy and hope of all his friends,\r\n      And terror of his foes.\r\n\r\n   Maliciously they vote\r\n      To work Old Jemmy’s ruin,\r\n   And zealously promote\r\n      A Bill for his undoing;\r\n   Both Lords and Commons most agree\r\n      To pull his Highness down,\r\n   But (spight of all their policy)\r\n      Old Jemmy’s heir to th’ crown.\r\n\r\n   The schismatick and saint,\r\n      The Baptist and the Atheist,\r\n   Swear by the Covenant,\r\n      Old Jemmy is a Papist:\r\n   Whilst all the holy crew did plot\r\n      To pull his Highness down,\r\n   Great Albany, a noble Scot\r\n      Did raise unto a crown.\r\n\r\n   Great Albany, they swear,\r\n      He before any other\r\n   Shall be immediate heir\r\n      Unto his royal brother;\r\n   Who will, in spight of all his foes,\r\n      His lawful rights maintain,\r\n   And all the fops that interpose\r\n      Old Jemmy’s York again.\r\n\r\n   The Whigs and zealots plot\r\n      To banish him the nation,\r\n   But the renowned Scot\r\n      Hath wrought his restoration:\r\n   With high respects they treat his Grace,\r\n      His royal cause maintain;\r\n   Brave Albany (to Scotland’s praise)\r\n      Is mighty York again.\r\n\r\n   Against his envious fates\r\n      The Kirk hath taught a lesson,\r\n   A blessing on the States,\r\n      To settle the succession;\r\n   They real were, both knight and lord,\r\n      And will his right maintain,\r\n   By royal Parliament restored,\r\n      Old Jemmy’s come again.\r\n\r\n   And now he’s come again,\r\n      In spight of all Pretenders;\r\n   Great Albany shall reign,\r\n      Amongst the Faith’s defenders.\r\n   Let Whig and Birmingham repine,\r\n      They show their teeth in vain,\r\n   The glory of the British line,\r\n      Old Jemmy’s come again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLOAK’S KNAVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom “Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy;

The expression is common in our earlier dramatic poets: thus\r\nShakespeare,—\r\n\r\n    —“I’ll have a bout with thee;\r\n    Devil, or devil’s dam, I’ll conjure thee:\r\n    Blood will I draw on thee, thou art a witch.”\r\n\r\n                                          (Hen.

This fame appears to have originated\r\npartly in the execution of a number of persons in 1612, who were\r\npretended to have been associated together in the crime of witchcraft,\r\nand who held their unearthly meetings at the Malkin Tower, in the forest\r\nof Pendle.  In 1613 was published an account of the trials, in a thick\r\npamphlet, entitled “The Wonderful Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of\r\nLancaster.  With the Arraignment and Triall of nineteene notorious\r\nWitches, at the Assizes and general Goale Deliverie, holden in the Castle\r\nof Lancaster, on Monday, the seventeenth of August last, 1612.

Caryl, who was a moderate\r\nindependent, was the author of the well-known “Commentary on Job.”  Dr\r\nOwen enjoyed the especial favour of Cromwell, who made him Dean of\r\nChristchurch, Oxford; in his youth he had shown an inclination to\r\nPresbyterianism, but early in the war he embraced the party of the\r\nIndependents.  He was a most prolific writer.  Nye was also an eminent\r\nwriter: previous to 1647 he had been a zealous Presbyterian, but on the\r\nrise of Cromwell’s influence he joined the Independents, and was employed\r\non several occasions by that party.—T. W.\r\n\r\n{50}  Col. John Ireton was the brother of the more celebrated Henry\r\nIreton, and was an alderman of London.  He appears to have been clerk of\r\nthe Council of Officers at Wallingford House.\r\n\r\n{51}  Col. Robert Tichbourne was also an alderman, and had been Lord\r\nMayor in 1658.  He was an enthusiast in religion of the Independent\r\nparty, and published several books, among which one was very celebrated,\r\nand is often referred to in the tracts of this period, entitled, “A\r\nCluster of Canaan’s Grapes.  Being severall experimented truths received\r\nthrough private communion with God by his Spirit, grounded on Scripture,\r\nand presented to open view for publique edification.”  London, 4to, Feb.\r\n16, 1649.  In a satirical tract of the year 1660 he is made to say, “I\r\nmade my mother, the city, drunk with the clusters which I brought from\r\nCanaan, and she in her drink made me a colonel.”  After the return of the\r\nsecluded members to the House, and the triumph of the city and the\r\nPresbyterian party, Ireton and Tichbourne were committed to the Tower,\r\ncharged with aiming at the overthrow of the liberties of the city, and\r\nother grave misdemeanours.  There are in the British Museum two satirical\r\ntracts relating to their imprisonment: 1. “The Apology of Robert Tichborn\r\nand John Ireton.  Being a serious Vindication of themselves and the Good\r\nold Cause, from the imputations cast upon them and it by the triumphing\r\ncity and nation in this their day of desertion.

The city look mighty blank, and cannot tell what\r\nin the world to do.”  The next day he turned from the Parliament, and\r\ntook part with the city.\r\n\r\n{55}  Thomas Scot and Luke Robinson were sent by the Parliament to\r\nexpostulate with Monk, but without effect.\r\n\r\n{56}  Pepys gives the following description of the rejoicings in the city\r\non the evening of the eleventh of February:—“In Cheapside there were a\r\ngreat many bonfires, and Bow bells and all the bells in all the churches\r\nas we went home were a-ringing.  Hence we went homewards, it being about\r\nten at night.  But the common joy that was everywhere to be seen!  The\r\nnumber of bonfires! there being fourteen between St Dunstan’s and Temple\r\nBar, and at Strand Bridge I could at one time tell thirty-one fires.  In\r\nKing-street seven or eight; and all along burning, and roasting, and\r\ndrinking for Rumps, there being rumps tied upon sticks and carried up and\r\ndown.  The butchers at the May Pole in the Strand rang a peal with their\r\nknives when they were going to sacrifice their rump.  On Ludgate Hill\r\nthere was one turning of a spit that had a rump tied upon it, and another\r\nbasting of it.  Indeed it was past imagination, both the greatness and\r\nthe suddenness of it.  At one end of the street you would think there was\r\na whole lane of fire, and so hot that we were fain to keep on the further\r\nside.”\r\n\r\n{57}  In a satirical tract, entitled “Free Parliament Quæries,” 4to,\r\nApril 10, 1660, it is inquired “Whether Sir Arthur did not act the Raging\r\nTurk in Westminster Hall, when he saw the admission of the secluded\r\nmembers?”  Pepys gives the following account of the reception of Monck’s\r\nletter from the city on the 11th of February:—“So I went up to the lobby,\r\nwhere I saw the Speaker reading of the letter; and after it was read Sir\r\nA. Haselrigge came out very angry, and Billing, standing by the door,\r\ntook him by the arm and cried, ‘Thou man, will thy beast carry thee no\r\nlonger? thou must fall!’”\r\n\r\n{58}  Haselrigge was accused of having been a dupe to Monck’s cunning\r\nintrigues.\r\n\r\n{59}  The celebrated Praise-God Barebone, at the head of a body of\r\nfanatics, had (February 9th) presented a strong petition to the House in\r\nsupport of the Good old Cause, which gave great offence to the\r\nPresbyterian party and the citizens, although it was received with\r\nthanks.  According to Pepys, one of Monck’s complaints against the\r\nParliament was, “That the late petition of the fanatique people presented\r\nby Barebone, for the imposing of an oath upon all sorts of people, was\r\nreceived by the House with thanks.”  The citizens did not omit to show\r\ntheir hostility against the presenter of the petition.  On the 12th,\r\nPepys says, “Charles Glascocke . . . told me the boys had last night\r\nbroke Barebone’s windows.”  And again, on the 22nd, “I observed this day\r\nhow abominably Barebone’s windows are broke again last night.”\r\n\r\n{60}  Miles Corbet, as well as Tichbourn, had sat upon the King in\r\njudgment.  In a satirical tract, published about the same time as the\r\npresent ballad, Tichbourn is made to say, “They say I am as notorious as\r\nMiles Corbet the Jew.”  In another, entitled “The Private Debates, etc.,\r\nof the Rump,” 4to, April 2, 1660, we read, “Call in the Jews, cryes\r\nCorbet, there is a certain sympathy (quoth he), methinks, between them\r\nand me.  Those wandering pedlers and I were doubtless made of the same\r\nmould; they have all such blote-herring faces as myself, and the devil\r\nhimself is in ’um for cruelty.”  He was one of those who fled on the\r\nRestoration, but he was afterwards taken treacherously in Holland, and,\r\nbeing brought to London, was executed as a regicide.  In another\r\nsatirical tract, entitled “A Continuation of the Acts and Monuments of\r\nour late Parliament” (Dec. 1659), it is stated that, “July 1, This very\r\nday the House made two serjeants-at-law, William Steele and Miles Corbet,\r\nand that was work enough for one day.”  And, in a fourth, “Resolved, That\r\nMiles Corbet and Robert Goodwin be freed from the trouble of the Chief\r\nRegister Office in Chancery.”  _Mercurius Honestus_, No. 1.  (March 21,\r\n1659–60.)\r\n\r\n{61}  William Lord Monson, Viscount Castlemaine, was member for Ryegate\r\nin the Long Parliament.  He was degraded from his honour at the\r\nRestoration, and was condemned to be drawn on a sledge with a rope round\r\nhis neck from the Tower to Tyburn, and back again, and to be imprisoned\r\nthere for life.  It appears, by the satirical tracts of the day, that he\r\nwas chiefly famous for being beaten by his wife.  In one, entitled “Your\r\nServant, Gentlemen,” 4to, 1659, it is asked, “Whether that member who\r\nlives nearest the church ought not to ride Skimmington next time my Lady\r\nMounson cudgels her husband?”  And in another (“The Rump Despairing,”\r\n4to, London, March 26, 1660) we find the following passage:—“To my Lord\r\nMonson.  A sceptre is one thing, and a ladle is another, and though his\r\nwife can tell how to use one, yet he is not fit to hold the other.”\r\n\r\n{62}  Pudding John, or Jack Pudding, was a proverbial expression of the\r\ntimes for a Merry Andrew.  In an old English-German Dictionary it is\r\nexplained thus:—“_Jack-Pudding_, un buffon de theatre, deliciæ populi,\r\nein Hanswurst, Pickelhering.”  The term was applied as a soubriquet to\r\nany man who played the fool to serve another person’s ends.  “And first\r\nSir Thomas Wrothe (_Jack Pudding_ to Prideaux the post-master) had his\r\ncue to go high, and feele the pulse of the hous.”  History of\r\nIndependency, p. 69 (4to, 1648).\r\n\r\n{63}  An allusion to James Harrington’s “Oceana.”\r\n\r\n{64}  James Harrington, a remarkable political writer of this time, had\r\nfounded a club called the Rota, in 1659, for the debating of political\r\nquestions.  This club met at Miles’s Coffee-house, in Old Palace Yard,\r\nand lasted a few mouths.  At the beginning of the present year was\r\npublished the result of their deliberations, under the title of “The\r\nRota: or, a Model of a Free State, or Equall Commonwealth; once proposed\r\nand debated in brief, and to be again more at large proposed to, and\r\ndebated by, a free and open Society of ingenious Gentlemen.”  4to,\r\nLondon, 1660 (Jan. 9).\r\n\r\n{65}  William Prynne, the lawyer, who had been so active a member of the\r\nLong Parliament when the Presbyterians were in power, was one of the\r\nsecluded members.  He returned to the House on the 21st of January, this\r\nyear.  Pepys says, “Mr Prin came with an old basket-hilt sword on, and\r\nhad a great many shouts upon his going into the hall.”\r\n\r\n{66}  John Wilde was one of the members for Worcestershire in the Long\r\nParliament.  In Cromwell’s last Parliament he represented Droitwich, and\r\nwas made by the Protector “Lord Chief Baron of the publick Exchequer.”\r\nIn a satirical pamphlet, contemporary with the present ballad, he is\r\nspoken of as “Sarjeant Wilde, best known by the name of the Wilde\r\nSerjeant.”  Another old song describes his personal appearance:\r\n\r\n    “But, Baron Wild, come out here,\r\n    Show your ferret face and snout here,\r\n    For you, being both a fool and a knave,\r\n    Are a monster in the rout here.”\r\n\r\n                                                       Loyal songs II. 55.\r\n\r\n{67}  See footnote {60}.\r\n\r\n{68}  Alderman Atkins.\r\n\r\n{69}  Ludlow was well known as a staunch Republican.

When he attempted to speak against the violent\r\ndissolution of the Long Parliament by Cromwell, the latter reproached him\r\nwith the licentiousness of his life.—T.

In Cromwell’s\r\nlast Parliament he represented Droitwich, and was made by the Protector\r\n“Lord Chief Baron of the Public Exchequer.”\r\n\r\n{83}  Sir Henry Slingsby and Dr Hewet were executed for treason against\r\nthe government of Oliver Cromwell in 1658.  Colonel John Gerard was\r\nbrought to the block at the beginning of the Protectorate, in 1654, for\r\nbeing engaged in a plot to assassinate Cromwell.\r\n\r\n{84}  John Lord Lisle represented Yarmouth in the Long Parliament.  He\r\nsat for Kent in the Parliament of 1653, and was afterwards a member of\r\nCromwell’s “other House,” and held the office of Lord Commissioner of the\r\nGreat Seal.  He was president of the High Courts of Justice which tried\r\nGerard, Slingsby, and Hewet.\r\n\r\n{85}  Nathaniel Fiennes, member for Banbury.  In the Parliament of 1654\r\nhe represented Oxfordshire.  He was afterwards, as Nathaniel Lord\r\nFiennes, a member of Cromwell’s “other House.”  Fiennes was accused of\r\ncowardice in surrendering Bristol (of which he was governor) to Prince\r\nRupert, somewhat hastily, in 1643.  His father, Lord Say and Sele,\r\nopposing Cromwell, was obliged to retire to the Isle of Lundy.\r\n\r\n{86}  John Lord Glynn, member of Cromwell’s “other House,” was “Chief\r\nJustice assigned to hold pleas in the Upper Bench.”  He was engaged in\r\nthe prosecution of the Earl of Strafford.  He was one of the eleven\r\nmembers impeached by the army in 1647.  In the Long Parliament, as well\r\nas in Cromwell’s Parliaments, he was member for Carnarvon.—T. W.\r\n\r\n{87}  Henry Nevil, member for Abingdon.  In Cromwell’s last Parliament he\r\nrepresented Reading.  In a satirical tract, he is spoken of as “religious\r\nHarry Nevill;” and we find in Burton’s Diary, that some months before the\r\ndate of the present song (on the 16th Feb. 1658–9) there was “a great\r\ndebate” on a charge of atheism and blasphemy which had been brought\r\nagainst him.—T. W.\r\n\r\n{88}  In the satirical tract entitled “England’s Confusion,” this member\r\nis described as “hastily rich Cornelius Holland.”  He appears to have\r\nrisen from a low station, and is characterized in the songs of the day as\r\nhaving been a link-bearer.—T. W.\r\n\r\n{89}  Major Salwey was an officer in the Parliamentary array.  On the\r\n17th January, 1660, he incurred the displeasure of the House, and was\r\nsequestered from his seat and sent to the Tower.  He is described as “a\r\nsmart, prating apprentice, newly set for himself.”  He appears to have\r\nbeen originally a grocer and tobacconist; a ballad of the time speaks of\r\nhim as,\r\n\r\n   “Salloway with tobacco\r\n   Inspired, turned State quack-o;\r\n   And got more by his feigned zeal\r\n   Then by his, _What d’ye lack-o_?”\r\n\r\nIn another he is introduced thus,\r\n\r\n   “The tobacco-man Salway, with a heart tall of gall\r\n   Puffs down bells, steeples, priests, churches and all,\r\n   As old superstitions relicks of Baal.”\r\n\r\nA third ballad, alluding to his attitude in the House, couples together\r\n\r\n   “Mr William Lilly’s astrological lyes,\r\n   And the meditations of Salloway biting his thumbs.”—T. W.\r\n\r\n{90}  Roger Hill was member for Bridport, in Dorsetshire.  He bought a\r\ngrant of the Bishop of Winchester’s manor of Taunton Dean, valued at 1200\r\npounds a year.  A ballad written towards the end of 1659 says of him,\r\n\r\n      “Baron Hill was but a valley,\r\n      And born scarce to an alley;\r\n   But now is lord of Taunton Dean,\r\n      And thousands he can rally.”\r\n\r\n{91}  With the revival of the Long Parliament, the old Republican\r\nfeelings arose again under the denomination of the “Good old Cause.”\r\nInnumerable pamphlets were published for and against “The Cause.”  Even\r\nPrynne, the fierce old Presbyterian, who was now turning against the\r\npatriots, lifted up his pen against it, and published “The Republicans\r\nand others spurious Good old Cause briefly and truly Anatomized,” 4to,\r\nMay 13, 1659.\r\n\r\n{92}  Robert Cecil, Esq., was one of the members of the Old Long\r\nParliament who were now brought together to form the Rump.  He\r\nrepresented Old Sarum, Wilts.\r\n\r\n{93}  Luke Robinson, of Pickering Lyth, in Yorkshire, was member for\r\nScarborough.  An old ballad says of him,\r\n\r\n      “Luke Robinson, that clownado,\r\n      Though his heart be a granado,\r\n   Yet a high shoe with his hand in his poke\r\n      Is his most perfect shadow.”\r\n\r\n{94}  Sir Harry Vane.\r\n\r\n{95}  Thomas Scott was member for Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire, in the\r\nLong Parliament.\r\n\r\n{96}  Hugh Peters, the celebrated fanatic.

I went out to Charing Cross to see Major-General\r\nHarrison hanged, drawn, and quartered, which was done there, he looking\r\nas cheerful as any man could do in that condition.”—Pepys.  Thomas\r\nHarrison was the son of a butcher at Newcastle-under-Line; he conveyed\r\nCharles I. from Windsor to Whitehall to his trial, and afterwards sat as\r\none of the judges.\r\n\r\n{102}  “October 15th.  This morning Mr Carew was hanged and quartered at\r\nCharing Cross; but his quarters, by a great favour, are not to be hanged\r\nup.”—Pepys.  Colonel John Carew, like Harrison, was one of the\r\nFifth-monarchy men, a violent and visionary but honest enthusiast.\r\n\r\n{103}  Hugh Peters, for his zeal in encouraging the Commonwealth\r\nsoldiery, was particularly hated by the Royalists.  John Coke, the able\r\nlawyer, conducted the prosecution of the King.\r\n\r\n{104}  Gregory Clement, John Jones, Thomas Scott, and Adrian Scrope, were\r\ncharged with sitting in the High Court of Justice which tried the King.\r\nScott was further charged with having, during the sitting of the Rump\r\nParliament, expressed his approbation of the sentence against the King.\r\nColonel Scrope, although he had been admitted to pardon, was selected as\r\none of the objects of vengeance, and was condemned chiefly on a reported\r\nconversation, in which, when one person had strongly blamed what he\r\ncalled the “murder” of the King, Scrope observed, “Some are of one\r\nopinion, and some of another.”\r\n\r\n{105}  “October 19th.  This morning Hacker and Axtell were hanged and\r\nquartered, as the rest are.”—Pepys.  Colonel Francis Hacker commanded the\r\nguards at the King’s execution.

Charles Lord Gerard, afterwards\r\ncreated Earl of Macclesfield, was a very distinguished Royalist officer.\r\nThomas Wentworth, Earl of Cleveland, who had suffered much for his\r\nloyalty to Charles I., headed a body of three hundred noblemen and\r\ngentlemen in the triumphal procession of Charles II. into London.\r\n\r\n{109}  Charles Stuart, a gallant Royalist officer, who had been created\r\nEarl of Litchfield by Charles I. in 1645, and who immediately after the\r\nRestoration succeeded his cousin Esme Stuart as Duke of Richmond.\r\nCharles Stanley, Earl of Derby, was son of the Earl of Derby who was\r\nbeheaded after the battle of Worcester, and of the Countess who so\r\ngallantly defended Latham House in 1644.\r\n\r\n{110}  The Nursery Rhyme, “The Man in the Moon drinks claret.”\r\n\r\n{111}  Philip Nye.\r\n\r\n{112}  William Kiffin was a celebrated preacher of this time, and had\r\nbeen an officer in the Parliamentary army.  A little before the\r\npublication of the present ballad a tract had appeared, with the title,\r\n“The Life and Approaching Death of William Kiffin.  Extracted out of the\r\nVisitation Book by a Church Member.”  4to, London, March 13, 1659–60.  He\r\nis here said to have been originally ’prentice to a glover, and to have\r\nbeen in good credit with Cromwell, who made him a lieutenant-colonel.
