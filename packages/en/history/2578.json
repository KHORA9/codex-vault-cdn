This will form the subject of the second\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nA third volume would be required to criticize and evaluate the source\r\nmaterial. I lack the necessary space: I merely state the rule that I\r\nhave observed. The trustworthiest testimony will always be that of an\r\neyewitness, especially\r\n\r\n* When this witness is an honorable, attentive, and intelligent man,\r\n\r\n* When he is writing on the spot, at the moment, and under the dictate\r\nof the facts themselves,\r\n\r\n* When it is obvious that his sole object is to preserve or furnish\r\ninformation,\r\n\r\n* When his work instead of a piece of polemics planned for the needs\r\nof a cause, or a passage of eloquence arranged for popular effect is a\r\nlegal deposition, a secret report, a confidential dispatch, a private\r\nletter, or a personal memento.\r\n\r\nThe nearer a document approaches this type, the more it merits\r\nconfidence, and supplies superior material.--I have found many of\r\nthis kind in the national archives, principally in the manuscript\r\ncorrespondence of ministers, intendants, sub-delegates, magistrates, and\r\nother functionaries; of military commanders, officers in the army,\r\nand gendarmerie; of royal commissioners, and of the Assembly; of\r\nadministrators of departments, districts, and municipalities, besides\r\npersons in private life who address the King, the National Assembly, or\r\nthe ministry. Among these are men of every rank, profession, education,\r\nand party. They are distributed by hundreds and thousands over the\r\nwhole surface of the territory. They write apart, without being able to\r\nconsult each other, and without even knowing each other. No one is so\r\nwell placed for collecting and transmitting accurate information. None\r\nof them seek literary effect, or even imagine that what they write will\r\never be published. They draw up their statements at once, under the\r\ndirect impression of local events. Testimony of this character, of the\r\nhighest order, and at first hand, provides the means by which all other\r\ntestimony ought to be verified.--The footnotes at the bottom of the\r\npages indicate the condition, office, name, and address of those\r\ndecisive witnesses. For greater certainty I have transcribed as often as\r\npossible their own words. In this way the reader, confronting the texts,\r\ncan interpret them for himself, and form his own opinions; he will have\r\nthe same documents as myself for arriving at his conclusions, and, if he\r\nis pleased to do so, he may conclude otherwise. As for allusions, if he\r\nfinds any, he himself will have introduced them, and if he applies them\r\nhe is alone responsible for them. To my mind, the past has features of\r\nits own, and the portrait here presented resembles only the France of\r\nthe past. I have drawn it without concerning myself with the discussions\r\nof the day; I have written as if my subject were the revolutions of\r\nFlorence or Athens. This is history, and nothing more, and, if I may\r\nfully express myself, I esteem my vocation of historian too highly to\r\nmake a cloak of it for the concealment of another. (December 1877).\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK FIRST. SPONTANEOUS ANARCHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE BEGINNINGS OF ANARCHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--Dearth the first cause.\r\n\r\n     Bad crops. The winter of 1788 and 1789.--High price and poor\r\n     quality of bread.--In the provinces.--At Paris.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of July 14-15, 1789, the Duc de la\r\nRochefoucauld-Liancourt caused Louis XVI to be aroused to inform him of\r\nthe taking of the Bastille. \"It is a revolt, then?\" exclaimed the King.\r\n\"Sire!\" replied the Duke; \"it is a revolution!\" The event was even more\r\nserious. Not only had power slipped from the hands of the King, but also\r\nit had not fallen into those of the Assembly. It now lay on the\r\nground, ready to the hands of the unchained populace, the violent and\r\nover-excited crowd, the mobs, which picked it up like some weapon that\r\nhad been thrown away in the street. In fact, there was no longer any\r\ngovernment; the artificial structure of human society was giving way\r\nentirely; things were returning to a state of nature. This was not a\r\nrevolution, but a dissolution.\r\n\r\nTwo causes excite and maintain the universal upheaval. The first one is\r\nfood shortages and dearth, which being constant, lasting for ten years,\r\nand aggravated by the very disturbances which it excites, bids fair to\r\ninflame the popular passions to madness, and change the whole course of\r\nthe Revolution into a series of spasmodic stumbles.\r\n\r\nWhen a stream is brimful, a slight rise suffices to cause an overflow.\r\nSo was it with the extreme distress of the eighteenth century. A poor\r\nman, who finds it difficult to live when bread is cheap, sees death\r\nstaring him in the face when it is dear. In this state of suffering the\r\nanimal instinct revolts, and the universal obedience which constitutes\r\npublic peace depends on a degree more or less of dryness or damp, heat\r\nor cold. In 1788, a year of severe drought, the crops had been poor. In\r\naddition to this, on the eve of the harvest,[1101] a terrible hail-storm\r\nburst over the region around Paris, from Normandy to Champagne,\r\ndevastating sixty leagues of the most fertile territory, and causing\r\ndamage to the amount of one hundred millions of francs. Winter came on,\r\nthe severest that had been seen since 1709. At the close of December the\r\nSeine was frozen over from Paris to Havre, while the thermometer stood\r\nat 180 below zero. A third of the olive-trees died in Provence, and the\r\nrest suffered to such an extent that they were considered incapable of\r\nbearing fruit for two years to come. The same disaster befell Languedoc.\r\nIn Vivarais, and in the Cevennes, whole forests of chestnuts had\r\nperished, along with all the grain and grass crops on the uplands. On\r\nthe plain the Rhone remained in a state of overflow for two months.\r\nAfter the spring of 1789 the famine spread everywhere, and it increased\r\nfrom month to month like a rising flood. In vain did the Government\r\norder the farmers, proprietors, and corn-dealers to keep the markets\r\nsupplied. In vain did it double the bounty on imports, resort to all\r\nsorts of expedients, involve itself in debt, and expend over forty\r\nmillions of francs to furnish France with wheat. In vain do individuals,\r\nprinces, noblemen, bishops, chapters, and communities multiply their\r\ncharities. The Archbishop of Paris incurring a debt of 400,000 livres,\r\none rich man distributing 40,000 francs the morning after the hailstorm,\r\nand a convent of Bernardines feeding twelve hundred poor persons for six\r\nweeks[1102]. But it had been too devastating. Neither public measures\r\nnor private charity could meet the overwhelming need. In Normandy, where\r\nthe last commercial treaty had ruined the manufacture of linen and\r\nof lace trimmings, forty thousand workmen were out of work. In many\r\nparishes one-fourth of the population[1103] are beggars. Here, \"nearly\r\nall the inhabitants, not excepting the farmers and landowners, are\r\neating barley bread and drinking water;\" there, \"many poor creatures\r\nhave to eat oat bread, and others soaked bran, which has caused the\r\ndeath of several children.\"--\"Above all,\" writes the Rouen Parliament,\r\n\"let help be sent to a perishing people. . .. Sire, most of your\r\nsubjects are unable to pay the price of bread, and what bread is given\r\nto those who do buy it \"--Arthur Young,[1104] who was traveling through\r\nFrance at this time, heard of nothing but the high cost of bread and the\r\ndistress of the people. At Troyes bread costs four sous a pound--that is\r\nto say, eight sous of the present day; and unemployed artisans flock\r\nto the relief works, where they can earn only twelve sous a day. In\r\nLorraine, according to the testimony of all observers, \"the people are\r\nhalf dead with hunger.\" In Paris the number of paupers has been trebled;\r\nthere are thirty thousand in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine alone. Around\r\nParis there is a short supply of grain, or it is spoilt[1105]. In the\r\nbeginning of July, at Montereau, the market is empty. \"The bakers could\r\nnot have baked\" if the police officers had not increased the price of\r\nbread to five sous per pound; the rye and barley which the intendant\r\nis able to send \"are of the worst possible quality, rotten and in a\r\ncondition to produce dangerous diseases. Nevertheless, most of the small\r\nconsumers are reduced to the hard necessity of using this spoilt grain.\"\r\nAt Villeneuve-le-Roi, writes the mayor, \"the rye of the two lots last\r\nsent is so black and poor that it cannot be retailed without wheat.\" At\r\nSens the barley \"tastes musty\" to such an extent that buyers of it throw\r\nthe detestable bread, which it makes in the face of the sub-delegate. At\r\nChevreuse the barley has sprouted and smells bad; the \"poor wretches,\"\r\nsays an employee, \"must be hard pressed with hunger to put up with it.\"\r\nAt Fontainebleau \"the barley, half eaten away, produces more bran than\r\nflour, and to make bread of it, one is obliged to work it over several\r\ntimes.\" This bread, such as it is, is an object of savage greed; \"it\r\nhas come to this, that it is impossible to distribute it except through\r\nwickets.\" And those who thus obtain their ration, \"are often attacked on\r\nthe road and robbed of it by the more vigorous of the famished people.\"\r\nAt Nangis \"the magistrates prohibit the same person from buying more\r\nthan two bushels in the same market.\" In short, provisions are so\r\nscarce that there is a difficulty in feeding the soldiers; the minister\r\ndispatches two letters one after another to order the cutting down\r\nof 250,000 bushels of rye before the harvest[1106]. Paris thus, in\r\na perfect state of tranquility, appears like a famished city put on\r\nrations at the end of a long siege, and the dearth will not be greater\r\nnor the food worse in December 1870, than in July 1789.\r\n\r\n\"The nearer the 14th of July approached,\" says an eyewitness,[1107] \"the\r\nmore did the dearth increase. Every baker's shop was surrounded by a\r\ncrowd, to which bread was distributed with the most grudging economy.\r\nThis bread was generally blackish, earthy, and bitter, producing\r\ninflammation of the throat and pain in the bowels. I have seen flour of\r\ndetestable quality at the military school and at other depots. I have\r\nseen portions of it yellow in color, with an offensive smell; some\r\nforming blocks so hard that they had to be broken into fragments\r\nby repeated blows of a hatchet. For my own part, wearied with the\r\ndifficulty of procuring this poor bread, and disgusted with that offered\r\nto me at the tables d'hôte, I avoided this kind of food altogether. In\r\nthe evening I went to the Café du Caveau, where, fortunately, they\r\nwere kind enough to reserve for me two of those rolls which are called\r\nflutes, and this is the only bread I have eaten for a week at a time.\"\r\n\r\nBut this resource is only for the rich. As for the people, to get bread\r\nfit for dogs, they must stand in a line for hours. And here they fight\r\nfor it; \"they snatch food from one another.\" There is no more work to\r\nbe had; \"the work-rooms are deserted;\" often, after waiting a whole\r\nday, the workman returns home empty-handed. When he does bring back a\r\nfour-pound loaf it costs him 3 francs 12 sous; that is, 12 sous for the\r\nbread, and 3 francs for the lost day. In this long line of unemployed,\r\nexcited men, swaying to and fro before the shop-door, dark thoughts are\r\nfermenting: \"if the bakers find no flour to-night to bake with, we shall\r\nhave nothing to eat to-morrow.\" An appalling idea;--in presence of which\r\nthe whole power of the Government is not too strong; for to keep order\r\nin the midst of famine nothing avails but the sight of an armed force,\r\npalpable and threatening. Under Louis XIV and Louis XV there had been\r\neven greater hunger and misery; but the outbreaks, which were roughly\r\nand promptly put down, were only partial and passing disorders. Some\r\nrioters were at once hung, and others were sent to the galleys. The\r\npeasant or the workman, convinced of his impotence, at once returned to\r\nhis stall or his plow. When a wall is too high one does not even think\r\nof scaling it.--But now the wall is cracking--all its custodians, the\r\nclergy, the nobles, the Third-Estate, men of letters, the politicians,\r\nand even the Government itself, making the breach wider. The wretched,\r\nfor the first time, discover an issue: they dash through it, at first\r\nin driblets, then in a mass, and rebellion becomes as universal as\r\nresignation was in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--Expectations the second cause\r\n\r\n     Separation and laxity of the administrative forces.--\r\n     Investigations of local assemblies. --The people become\r\n     aware of their condition.--Convocation of the States-\r\n     General.--Hope is born. The coincidence of early Assemblies\r\n     with early difficulties.\r\n\r\nIt is just through this breach that hope steals like a beam of light,\r\nand gradually finds its way down to the depths below. For the last fifty\r\nyears it has been rising, and its rays, which first illuminated the\r\nupper class in their splendid apartments in the first story, and next\r\nthe middle class in their entresol and on the ground floor. They have\r\nnow for two years penetrated to the cellars where the people toil, and\r\neven to the deep sinks and obscure corners where rogues and vagabonds\r\nand malefactors, a foul and swarming herd, crowd and hide themselves\r\nfrom the persecution of the law.--To the first two provincial assemblies\r\ninstituted by Necker in 1778 and 1779, Loménie de Brienne has in 1787\r\njust added nineteen others; under each of these are assemblies of the\r\narrondissement, under each assembly of the arrondissement are parish\r\nassemblies[1108]. Thus the whole machinery of administration has been\r\nchanged. It is the new assemblies which assess the taxes and superintend\r\ntheir collection; which determine upon and direct all public works; and\r\nwhich form the court of final appeal in regard to matters in dispute.\r\nThe intendant, the sub-delegate, the elected representative[1109], thus\r\nlose three-quarters of their authority. Conflicts arise, consequently,\r\nbetween rival powers whose frontiers are not clearly defined; command\r\nshifts about, and obedience is diminished. The subject no longer feels\r\non his shoulders the commanding weight of the one hand which, without\r\npossibility of interference or resistance, held him in, urged him\r\nforward, and made him move on. Meanwhile, in each assembly of the\r\nparish arrondissement, and even of the province, plebeians,\r\n\"husband-men,\"[1110] and often common farmers, sit by the side of lords\r\nand prelates. They listen to and remember the vast figure of the taxes\r\nwhich are paid exclusively, or almost exclusively, by them--the taille\r\nand its accessories, the poll-tax and road dues, and assuredly on their\r\nreturn home they talk all this over with their neighbor. These figures\r\nare all printed; the village attorney discusses the matter with his\r\nclients, the artisans and rustics, on Sunday as they leave the mass,\r\nor in the evening in the large public room of the tavern. These little\r\ngatherings, moreover, are sanctioned, encouraged by the powers above.\r\nIn the earliest days of 1788 the provincial assemblies order a board\r\nof inquiry to be held by the syndics and inhabitants of each parish.\r\nKnowledge is wanted in detail of their grievances. What part of the\r\nrevenue is chargeable to each impost? What must the cultivator pay and\r\nhow much does he suffer? How many privileged persons there are in the\r\nparish, what is the amount of their fortune, are they residents, and\r\nwhat their exemptions amount to? In replying, the attorney who holds the\r\npen, names and points out with his finger each privileged individual,\r\ncriticizes his way of living, and estimates his fortune, calculates the\r\ninjury done to the village by his immunities, inveighs against the taxes\r\nand the tax-collectors. On leaving these assemblies the villager broods\r\nover what he has just heard. He sees his grievances no longer singly as\r\nbefore, but in mass, and coupled with the enormity of evils under which\r\nhis fellows suffer. Besides this, they begin to disentangle the causes\r\nof their misery: the King is good--why then do his collectors take so\r\nmuch of our money? This or that canon or nobleman is not unkind--why\r\nthen do they make us pay in their place?--Imagine that a sudden gleam of\r\nreason should allow a beast of burden to comprehend the contrast between\r\nthe species of horse and mankind. Imagine, if you can, what its first\r\nideas would be in relation to the coachmen and drivers who bridle\r\nand whip it and again in relation to the good-natured travelers and\r\nsensitive ladies who pity it, but who to the weight of the vehicle add\r\ntheir own and that of their luggage.\r\n\r\nLikewise, in the mind of the peasant, athwart his perplexed brooding, a\r\nnew idea, slowly, little by little, is unfolded:--that of an oppressed\r\nmultitude of which he makes one, a vast herd scattered far beyond the\r\nvisible horizon, everywhere ill used, starved, and fleeced. Towards the\r\nend of 1788 we begin to detect in the correspondence of the intendants\r\nand military commandants the dull universal muttering of coming\r\nwrath. Men's characters seem to change; they become suspicious and\r\nrestive.--And just at this moment, the Government, dropping the reins,\r\ncalls upon them to direct themselves.[1111]. In the month of November\r\n1787, the King declared that he would convoke the States-General. On the\r\n5th of July 1788, he calls for memoranda (des mémoires) on this subject\r\nfrom every competent person and body. On the 8th of August he fixes the\r\ndate of the session. On the 5th of October he convokes the notables,\r\nin order to consider the subject with them. On the 27th of December he\r\ngrants a double representation to the Third-Estate, because \"its cause\r\nis allied with generous sentiments, and it will always obtain the\r\nsupport of public opinion.\" The same day he introduces into the\r\nelectoral assemblies of the clergy a majority of curés[1112], \"because\r\ngood and useful pastors are daily and closely associated with the\r\nindigence and relief of the people,\" from which it follows \"that they\r\nare much more familiar with their sufferings\" and necessities. On\r\nthe 24th January 1789, he prescribes the procedure and method of the\r\nmeetings. After the 7th of February writs of summons are sent out one\r\nafter the other. Eight days after, each parish assembly begins to draw\r\nup its memorial of grievances, and becomes excited over the detailed\r\nenumeration of all the miseries which it sets down in writing.--All\r\nthese appeals and all these acts are so many strokes, which reverberate,\r\nin the popular imagination. \"It is the desire of His Majesty,\" says the\r\norder issued, \"that every one, from the extremities of his kingdom, and\r\nfrom the most obscure of its hamlets, should be certain of his wishes\r\nand protests reaching him.\" Thus, it is all quite true: there can be\r\nno mistake about it, the thing is sure. The people are invited to speak\r\nout, they are summoned, and they are consulted. There is a disposition\r\nto relieve them; henceforth their misery shall be less; better times\r\nare coming. This is all they know about it. A few month after, in\r\nJuly,[1113] the only answer a peasant girl can make to Arthur Young is,\r\n\"something was to be done by some great folks for such poor ones, but\r\nshe did not know who nor how.\" The thing is too complicated, beyond the\r\nreach of a stupefied and mechanical brain.--One idea alone emerges, the\r\nhope of immediate relief. The persuasion that one is entitled to it, the\r\nresolution to aid it with every possible means. Consequently, an anxious\r\nwaiting, a ready fervor, a tension of the will simply due to the waiting\r\nfor the opportunity to let go and take off like a irresistible arrow\r\ntowards the unknown end which will reveal itself all of a sudden. Hunger\r\nis to mark this sudden target out for them.\r\n\r\nThe market must be supplied with wheat; the farmers and land-owners must\r\nbring it; wholesale buyers, whether the Government or individuals, must\r\nnot be allowed to send it elsewhere. The wheat must be sold at a low\r\nprice; the price must be cut down and fixed, so that the baker can sell\r\nbread at two sous the pound. Grain, flour, wine, salt, and provisions\r\nmust pay no more duties. Seignorial dues and claims, ecclesiastical\r\ntithes, and royal or municipal taxes must no longer exist. On the\r\nstrength of this idea disturbances broke out on all sides in March,\r\nApril, and May. Contemporaries \"do not know what to think of such\r\na scourge;[1114] they cannot comprehend how such a vast number of\r\ncriminals, without visible leaders, agree amongst themselves everywhere\r\nto commit the same excesses just at the time when the States-General are\r\ngoing to begin their sittings.\" The reason is that, under the ancient\r\nrégime, the conflagration was smoldering in a closed chamber; the great\r\ndoor is suddenly opened, the air enters, and immediately the flame\r\nbreaks out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--The provinces during the first six months of 1789\r\n\r\n     Effects of the famine.\r\n\r\nAt first there are only intermittent, isolated fires, which are\r\nextinguished or go out of themselves; but, a moment after, in the same\r\nplace, or very near it, the sparks again appear. Their number, like\r\ntheir recurrence, shows the vastness, depth, and heat of the combustible\r\nmatter, which is about to explode. In the four months, which precede the\r\ntaking of the Bastille, over three hundred outbreaks may be counted in\r\nFrance. They take place from month to month and from week to week, in\r\nPoitou, Brittany, Touraine, Orléanais, Normandy, Ile-de-France, Picardy,\r\nChampagne, Alsace, Burgundy, Nivernais, Auvergne, Languedoc, and\r\nProvence. On the 28th of May the parliament of Rouen announces robberies\r\nof grain, \"violent and bloody tumults, in which men on both sides have\r\nfallen,\" throughout the province, at Caen, Saint-Lô, Mortain, Granville,\r\nEvreux, Bernay, Pont-Andemer, Elboeuf; Louviers, and in other sections\r\nbesides. On the 20th of April Baron de Bezenval, military commander\r\nin the Central Provinces, writes: \"I once more lay before M. Necker a\r\npicture of the frightful condition of Touraine and of Orléanais. Every\r\nletter I receive from these two provinces is the narrative of three\r\nor four riots, which are put down with difficulty by the troops and\r\nconstabulary,\"[1115]--and throughout the whole extent of the kingdom a\r\nsimilar state of things is seen. The women, as is natural, are generally\r\nat the head of these outbreaks. It is they who, at Montlhéry, rip open\r\nthe sacks of grain with their scissors. On learning each week, on market\r\nday that the price of a loaf of bread advances three, four, or seven\r\nsous, they break out into shrieks of rage: at this rate for bread, with\r\nthe small salaries of the men, and when work fails,[1116] how can a\r\nfamily be fed? Crowds gather around the sacks of flour and the doors of\r\nthe bakers. Amidst outcries and reproaches some one in the crowd makes a\r\npush; the proprietor or dealer is hustled and knocked down. The shop\r\nis invaded, the commodity is in the hands of the buyers and of the\r\nfamished, each one grabbing for himself, pay or no pay, and running\r\naway with the booty.--Sometimes a party is made up beforehand[1117]\r\nAt Bray-sur-Seine, on the 1st of May, the villagers for four leagues\r\naround, armed with stones, knives, and cudgels, to the number of four\r\nthousand, compel the metayers and farmers, who have brought grain with\r\nthem, to sell it at 3 livres, instead of 4 livres 10 sous the bushel.\r\nThey threaten to do the same thing on the following market-day: but the\r\nfarmers do not return, the storehouse remains empty. Now soldiers must\r\nbe at hand, or the inhabitants of Bray will be pillaged. At Bagnols, in\r\nLanguedoc, on the 1st and 2nd of April, the peasants, armed with cudgels\r\nand assembled by tap of drum, \"traverse the town, threatening to burn\r\nand destroy everything if flour and money are not given to them.\"\r\nThey go to private houses for grain, divide it amongst themselves at a\r\nreduced price, \"promising to pay when the next crop comes round,\" and\r\nforce the Consuls to put bread at two sous the pound, and to increase\r\nthe day's wages four sous.--Indeed this is now the regular thing; it is\r\nnot the people who obey the authorities, but the authorities who obey\r\nthe people. Consuls, sheriffs, mayors, municipal officers, town-clerks,\r\nbecome confused and hesitating in the face of this huge clamor; they\r\nfeel that they are likely to be trodden under foot or thrown out of the\r\nwindows. Others, with more firmness, being aware that a riotous crowd\r\nis mad, and having scruples to spill blood; yield for the time being,\r\nhoping that at the next market-day there will be more soldiers\r\nand better precautions taken. At Amiens, \"after a very violent\r\noutbreak,\"[1118] they decide to take the wheat belonging to the Jacobin\r\nmonks, and, protected by the troops, to sell it to the people at a third\r\nbelow its value. At Nantes, where the town hall is attacked, they are\r\nforced to lower the price of bread one sou per pound. At Angoulême, to\r\navoid a recourse to arms, they request the Comte d'Artois to renounce\r\nhis dues on flour for two months, reduce the price of bread, and\r\ncompensate the bakers. At Cette they are so maltreated they let\r\neverything take its course; the people sack their dwellings and get the\r\nupper hand; they announce by sound of trumpet that all their demands are\r\ngranted. On other occasions, the mob dispenses with their services and\r\nacts for itself. If there happens to be no grain on the market-place,\r\nthe people go after it wherever they can find it--to proprietors and\r\nfarmers who are unable to bring it for fear of pillage; to convents,\r\nwhich by royal edict are obliged always to have one year's crop in\r\nstore; to granaries where the Government keeps its supplies; and to\r\nconvoys which are dispatched by the intendants to the relief of famished\r\ntowns. Each for himself--so much the worse for his neighbor. The\r\ninhabitants of Fougères beat and drive out those who come from Ernée\r\nto buy in their market; a similar violence is shown at Vitré to the\r\nin-habitants of Maine.[1119] At Sainte-Léonard the people stop the grain\r\nstarted for Limoges; at Bost that intended for Aurillac; at Saint-Didier\r\nthat ordered for Moulins; and at Tournus that dispatched to Macon. In\r\nvain are escorts added to the convoys; troops of men and women, armed\r\nwith hatchets and guns, put themselves in ambush in the woods along the\r\nroad, and seize the horses by their bridles; the saber has to be used to\r\nsecure any advance. In vain are arguments and kind words offered, \"and\r\nin vain even is wheat offered for money; they refuse, shouting out that\r\nthe convoy shall not go on.\" They have taken a stubborn stand, their\r\nresolution being that of a bull planted in the middle of the road and\r\nlowering his horns. Since the wheat is in the district, it is theirs;\r\nwhoever carries it off or withholds it is a robber. This fixed idea\r\ncannot be driven out of their minds. At Chant-nay, near Mans,[1120]\r\nthey prevent a miller from carrying that which he had just bought to\r\nhis mill. At Montdragon, in Languedoc, they stone a dealer in the act of\r\nsending his last wagon load elsewhere. At Thiers, workmen go in force\r\nto gather wheat in the fields; a proprietor with whom some is found\r\nis nearly killed; they drink wine in the cellars, and leave the taps\r\nrunning. At Nevers, the bakers not having put bread on their counters\r\nfor four days, the mob force the granaries of private persons, of\r\ndealers and religious communities. \"The frightened corn-dealers part\r\nwith their grain at any price; most of it is stolen in the face of the\r\nguards,\" and, in the tumult of these searches of homes, a number of\r\nhouses are sacked.--In these days woe to all who are concerned in the\r\nacquisition, commerce, and manipulation of grain! Popular imagination\r\nrequires living beings to who it may impute its misfortunes, and on whom\r\nit may gratify its resentments. To it, all such persons are monopolists,\r\nand, at any rate, public enemies. Near Angers the Benedictine\r\nestablishment is invaded, and its fields and woods are devastated.[1121]\r\nAt Amiens \"the people are arranging to pillage and perhaps burn the\r\nhouses of two merchants, who have built labor-saving mills.\" Restrained\r\nby the soldiers, they confine themselves to breaking windows; but other\r\n\"groups come to destroy or plunder the houses of two or three persons\r\nwhom they suspect of being monopolists.\" At Nantes, a sieur Geslin,\r\nbeing deputized by the people to inspect a house, and finding no wheat,\r\na shout is set up that he is a receiver, an accomplice! The crowd rush\r\nat him, and he is wounded and almost cut in pieces.--It is very evident\r\nthat there is no more security in France; property, even life, is in\r\ndanger. The primary possession, food, is violated in hundreds of places,\r\nand is everywhere menaced and precarious. The local officials everywhere\r\ncall for aid, declare the constabulary incompetent, and demand\r\nregular troops. And mark how public authority, everywhere inadequate,\r\ndisorganized, and tottering, finds stirred up against it not only the\r\nblind madness of hunger, but, in addition, the evil instincts which\r\nprofit by every disorder and the inveterate lusts which every political\r\ncommotion frees from restraint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--Intervention of ruffians and vagabonds.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how numerous the smugglers, dealers in contraband salt,\r\npoachers, vagabonds, beggars, and escaped convicts[1122] have become,\r\nand how a year of famine increases the number. All are so many recruits\r\nfor the mobs, and whether in a disturbance or by means of a disturbance\r\neach one of them fills his pouch. Around Caux,[1123] even up to the\r\nenvirons of Rouen, at Roncherolles, Quévrevilly, Préaux, Saint-Jacques,\r\nand in the entire surrounding neighborhood bands of armed bandits force\r\ntheir way into the houses, particularly the parsonages, and lay their\r\nhands on whatever they please. To the south of Chartres \"three or four\r\nhundred woodcutters, from the forests of Bellème, chop away everything\r\nthat opposes them, and force grain to be given up to them at their own\r\nprice.\" In the vicinity of Étampes, fifteen bandits enter the\r\nfarmhouses at night and put the farmer to ransom, threatening him with\r\na conflagration. In Cambrésis they pillage the abbeys of Vauchelles, of\r\nVerger, and of Guillemans, the château of the Marquis de Besselard, the\r\nestate of M. Doisy, two farms, the wagons of wheat passing along the\r\nroad to Saint-Quentin, and, besides this, seven farms in Picardy.\r\n\"The seat of this revolt is in some villages bordering on Picardy and\r\nCambrésis, familiar with smuggling operations and to the license of\r\nthat pursuit.\" The peasants allow themselves to be enticed away by the\r\nbandits. Man slips rapidly down the incline of dishonesty; one who\r\nis half-honest, and takes part in a riot inadvertently or in spite of\r\nhimself; repeats the act, allured on by impunity or by gain. In fact,\r\n\"it is not dire necessity which impels them;\" they make a speculation of\r\ncupidity, a new sort of illicit trade. An old soldier, saber in hand, a\r\nforest-keeper, and \"about eight persons sufficiently lax, put themselves\r\nat the head of four or five hundred men, go off each day to three or\r\nfour villages. Here they force everybody who has any wheat to give it\r\nto them at 24 livres,\" and even at 18 livres, the sack. Those among the\r\nband, who say that they have no money, carry away their portion without\r\npayment. Others, after having paid what they please, re-sell at a\r\nprofit, which amounts to even 45 livres the sack. This is a good\r\nbusiness, and one in which greed takes poverty for its accomplice. At\r\nthe next harvest the temptation will be similar: \"they have threatened\r\nto come and do our harvesting for us, and also to take our cattle and\r\nsell the meat in the villages at the rate of two sous the pound.\"--In\r\nevery important insurrection there are similar evil-does and vagabonds,\r\nenemies to the law, savage, prowling desperadoes, who, like wolves, roam\r\nabout wherever they scent a prey. It is they who serve as the directors\r\nand executioners of public or private malice. Near Uzès twenty-five\r\nmasked men, with guns and clubs, enter the house of a notary, fire a\r\npistol at him, beat him, wreck the premises, and burn his registers\r\nalong with the title-deeds and papers which he has in keeping for the\r\nCount de Rouvres. Seven of them are arrested, but the people are on\r\ntheir side, and fall on the constabulary and free them.[1124]--They\r\nare known by their acts, by their love of destruction for the sake of\r\ndestruction, by their foreign accent, by their savage faces and their\r\nrags. Some of them come from Paris to Rouen, and, for four days, the\r\ntown is at their mercy.[1125] The stores are forced open, train wagons\r\nare discharged, wheat is wasted, and convents and seminaries are put to\r\nransom. They invade the dwelling of the attorney-general, who has begun\r\nproceedings against them, and want to tear him to pieces. They break his\r\nmirrors and his furniture, leave the premises laden with booty, and go\r\ninto the town and its outskirts to pillage the manufactories and break\r\nup or burn all the machinery.--Henceforth these constitute the new\r\nleaders: for in every mob it is the boldest and least scrupulous\r\nwho march ahead and set the example in destruction. The example is\r\ncontagious: the beginning was the craving for bread, the end is murder\r\nand arson; the savagery which is unchained adding its unlimited violence\r\nto the limited revolt of necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--Effect on the Population of the New Ideas.\r\n\r\nBad as it is, this savagery might, perhaps, have been overcome, in spite\r\nof the dearth and of the brigands; but what renders it irresistible is\r\nthe belief of its being authorized, and that by those whose duty it is\r\nto repress it. Here and there words and actions of a brutal frankness\r\nbreak forth, and reveal beyond the somber present a more threatening\r\nfuture--After the 9th of January, 1789, among the mob which attacks the\r\nHôtel-de-Ville and besieges the bakers' shops of Nantes, \"shouts of Vive\r\nla Liberté![1126] mingled with those of Vive le Roi! are heard.\" A\r\nfew months later, around Ploërmel, the peasants refuse to pay tithes,\r\nalleging that the memorial of their seneschal's court demands their\r\nabolition. In Alsace, after March, there is the same refusal \"in many\r\nplaces;\" many of the communities even maintain that they will pay no\r\nmore taxes until their deputies to the States-General shall have fixed\r\nthe precise amount of the public contributions. In Isère it is decided,\r\nby proceedings, printed and published, that \"personal dues\" shall no\r\nlonger be paid, while the landowners who are affected by this dare\r\nnot prosecute in the tribunals. At Lyons, the people have come to the\r\nconclusion \"that all levies of taxes are to cease,\" and, on the 29th of\r\nJune, on hearing of the meeting of the three orders, \"astonished by the\r\nilluminations and signs of public rejoicing,\" they believe that the good\r\ntime has come.\" They think of forcing the delivery of meat to them at\r\nfour sous the pound, and wine at the same rate. The publicans insinuate\r\nto them the prospective abolition of octrois.[1127] and that, meanwhile,\r\nthe King, in favor of the re-assembling of the three orders, has granted\r\nthree days' freedom from all duties at Paris, and that Lyons ought\r\nto enjoy the same privilege.\" Upon this the crowd, rushing off to\r\nthe barriers, to the gates of Sainte-Claire and Perrache, and to the\r\nGuillotière bridge, burn or demolish the bureaux, destroy the registers,\r\nsack the lodgings of the clerks, carry off the money and pillage the\r\nwine on hand in the depot. In the mean time a rumor has circulated all\r\nround through the country that there is free entrance into the town for\r\nall provisions. During the following days the peasantry stream in with\r\nenormous files of wagons loaded with wine and drawn by several oxen, so\r\nthat, in spite of the re-established guard, it is necessary to let them\r\nenter all day without paying the dues. It is only on the 7th of July\r\nthat these can again be collected.--The same thing occurs in the\r\nsouthern provinces, where the principal imposts are levied on\r\nprovisions. There also the collections are suspended in the name of\r\npublic authority. At Agde,[1128] \"the people, considering the so-called\r\nwill of the King as to equality of classes, are foolish enough to think\r\nthat they are everything and can do everything.\" Thus do they interpret\r\nin their own way and in their own terms the double representation\r\naccorded to the Third-Estate. They threaten the town, consequently, with\r\ngeneral pillage if the prices of all provisions are not reduced, and if\r\nthe duties of the province on wine, fish, and meat are not suppressed.\r\nThey also wish to nominate consuls who have sprung up out of their\r\nbody.\" The bishop, the lord of the manor, the mayor and the notables,\r\nagainst whom they forcibly stir up the peasantry in the country, are\r\nobliged to proclaim by sound of trumpet that their demands shall be\r\ngranted. Three days afterwards they exact a diminution of one-half of\r\nthe tax on grinding, and go in quest of the bishop who owns the mills.\r\nThe prelate, who is ill, sinks down in the street and seats himself on\r\na stone; they compel him forthwith to sign an act of renunciation,\r\nand hence \"his mill, valued at 15,000 livres, is reduced to 7,500\r\nlivres.\"--At Limoux, under the pretext of searching for grain, they\r\nenter the houses of the comptroller and tax contractors, carry off their\r\nregisters, and throw them into the water along with the furniture of\r\ntheir clerks.--In Provence it is worse; for most unjustly, and through\r\ninconceivable imprudence, the taxes of the towns are all levied on\r\nflour. It is therefore to this impost that the dearness of bread is\r\ndirectly attributed. Hence the fiscal agent becomes a manifest enemy,\r\nand revolts on account of hunger are transformed into insurrections\r\nagainst the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--The first jacquerie in Province\r\n\r\n     Feebleness or ineffectiveness of repressive measures.\r\n\r\nHere, again, political novelties are the spark that ignites the mass\r\nof gunpowder. Everywhere, the uprising of the people takes place on\r\nthe very day on which the electoral assembly meets. From forty to\r\nfifty riots occur in the provinces in less than a fortnight. Popular\r\nimagination, like that of a child, goes straight to its mark. The\r\nreforms having been announced, people think them accomplished and, to\r\nmake sure of them, steps are at once taken to carry them out. Now\r\nthat we are to have relief, let us relieve ourselves. \"This is not an\r\nisolated riot as usual,\" writes the commander of the troops;[1129]\r\n\"here the faction is united and governed by uniform principles; the same\r\nerrors are diffused through all minds. . . . . The principles impressed\r\non the people are that the King desires equality. No more bishops\r\nor lords, no more distinctions of rank, no tithes, and no seignorial\r\nprivileges. Thus, these misguided people fancy that they are exercising\r\ntheir rights, and obeying the will of the King.\"--The effect of sonorous\r\nphrases is apparent. The people have been told that the States-General\r\nwere to bring about the \"regeneration of the kingdom\" The inference is\r\n\"that the date of their assembly was to be one of an entire and absolute\r\nchange of conditions and fortunes.\" Hence, \"the insurrection against the\r\nnobles and the clergy is as active as it is widespread.\" \"In many\r\nplaces it was distinctly announced that there was a sort of war declared\r\nagainst landowners and property,\" and \"in the towns as well as in the\r\nrural districts the people persist in declaring that they will pay\r\nnothing, neither taxes, duties, nor debts.\"--Naturally, the first\r\nassault is against the piquèt, or flour-tax. At Aix, Marseilles, Toulon,\r\nand in more than forty towns and market-villages, this is summarily\r\nabolished; at Aupt and at Luc nothing remains of the weighing-house but\r\nthe four walls. At Marseilles the home of the slaughter-house contractor\r\nand at Brignolles that of the director of the leather excise, are\r\nsacked. The determination is \"to purge the land of excise-men. \"--This\r\nis only a beginning; bread and other provisions must become cheap, and\r\nthat without delay. At Arles, the Corporation of sailors, presided over\r\nby M. de Barras, consul, had just elected its representatives. By way of\r\nconclusion to the meeting, they pass a resolution insisting that M. de\r\nBarras should reduce the price of all comestibles. On his refusal, they\r\n\"open the window, exclaiming, 'We hold him, and we have only to throw\r\nhim into the street for the rest to pick him up.'\" Compliance is\r\ninevitable. The resolution is proclaimed by the town-criers, and at each\r\narticle which is reduced in price the crowd shout, \"Vive le Roi, vive M.\r\nBarras!\"--One must yield to brute force. But the inconvenience is great\r\nfor, through the suppression of the flour-tax, the towns have no longer\r\na revenue. On the other hand, as they are obliged to indemnify the\r\nbutchers and bakers, Toulon, for instance, incurs a debt of 2,500 livres\r\na day.\r\n\r\nIn this state of disorder, woe to those who are under suspicion of\r\nhaving contributed, directly or indirectly, to the evils, which the\r\npeople endure! At Toulon a demand is made for the head of the mayor, who\r\nsigns the tax-list, and of the keeper of the records. They are trodden\r\nunder foot, and their houses are ransacked. At Manosque, the Bishop\r\nof Sisteron, who is visiting the seminary, is accused of favoring\r\na monopolist. On his way to his carriage, on foot, he is hooted and\r\nmenaced. He is first pelted with mud, and then with stones. The consuls\r\nin attendance, and the sub-delegate, who come to his assistance, are\r\nmauled and repulsed. Meanwhile, some of the most furious begin, before\r\nhis eyes, \"to dig a ditch to bury him in.\" Protected by five or six\r\nbrave fellows, amidst a volley of stones, and wounded on the head and\r\non many parts of his body, he succeeds in reaching his carriage. He is\r\nfinally only saved because the horses, which are likewise stoned, run\r\naway. Foreigners, Italians, bandits, are mingled with the peasants and\r\nartisans, and expressions are heard and acts are seen which indicate a\r\njacquerie.[1130] \"The most excited said to the bishop, 'we are poor and\r\nyou are rich, and we mean to have all your property.'\"[1131] Elsewhere,\r\n\"the seditious mob exacts contributions from all people in good\r\ncircumstances. At Brignolles, thirteen houses are pillaged from top to\r\nbottom, and thirty others partly half.--At Aupt, M. de Montferrat, in\r\ndefending himself, is killed and \"hacked to pieces.\"--At La Seyne, the\r\nmob, led by a peasant, assembles by beat of drum. Some women fetch a\r\nbier, and set it down before the house of a leading bourgeois, telling\r\nhim to prepare for death, and that \"they will have the honor of burying\r\nhim.\" He escapes; his house is pillaged, as well as the bureau of\r\nthe flour-tax. The following day, the chief of the band \"obliges the\r\nprincipal inhabitants to give him a sum of money to indemnify, as he\r\nstates it, the peasants who have abandoned their work,\" and devoted the\r\nday to serving the public.--At Peinier, the Président de Peinier, an\r\noctogenarian, is \"besieged in his chateau by a band of a hundred and\r\nfifty artisans and peasants,\" who bring with them a consul and a notary.\r\nAided by these two functionaries, they force the president \"to pass an\r\nact by which he renounces his seignorial rights of every description\r\n\"--At Sollier they destroy the mills belonging to M. de Forbin-Janson.\r\nThey sack the house of his business agent, pillage the château, and\r\ndemolish the roof, chapel, altar, railings, and escutcheons. They enter\r\nthe cellars, stave in the casks, and carry away everything that can\r\nbe carried, \"the transportation taking two days;\" all of which cause\r\ndamages of a hundred thousand crowns to the marquis.--At Riez they\r\nsurround the episcopal palace with fagots, threatening to burn it, \"and\r\ncompromise with the bishop on a promise of fifty thousand livres,\" and\r\nwant him to burn his archives.--In short, the sedition is social for it\r\nsingles out for attack all that profit by, or stand at the head of, the\r\nestablished order of things.\r\n\r\nSeeing them act in this way, one would say that the theory of the\r\nContrat-Social had been instilled into them. They treat magistrates as\r\ndomestics, promulgate laws, and conduct themselves like sovereigns.\r\nThey exercise public power, and establish, summarily, arbitrarily,\r\nand brutally, whatever they think to be in conformity with natural\r\nright.--At Peinier they exact a second electoral assembly, and, for\r\nthemselves, the right of suffrage.--At Saint-Maximin they themselves\r\nelect new consuls and officers of justice.--At Solliez they oblige the\r\njudge's lieutenant to give in his resignation, and they break his\r\nstaff of office.--At Barjols \"they use consuls and judges as their town\r\nservants, announcing that they are masters and that they will themselves\r\nadminister justice.\"--In fact, they do administer it, as they understand\r\nit--that is to say, through many exactions and robberies! One man has\r\nwheat; he must share it with him who has none. Another has money;\r\nhe must give it to him who has not enough to buy bread with. On this\r\nprinciple, at Barjols, they tax the Ursulin nuns 1,800 livres, carry off\r\nfifty loads of wheat from the Chapter, eighteen from one poor artisan,\r\nand forty from another, and constrain canons and beneficiaries to give\r\nacquittances to their farmers. Then, from house to house, with club\r\nin hand, they oblige some to hand over money, others to abandon their\r\nclaims on their debtors, \"one to desist from criminal proceedings,\r\nanother to nullify a decree obtained, a third to reimburse the expenses\r\nof a lawsuit gained years before, a father to give his consent to the\r\nmarriage of his son.\"--All their grievances are brought to mind, and we\r\nall know the tenacity of a peasant's memory. Having become the master,\r\nhe redresses wrongs, and especially those of which he thinks himself the\r\nobject. There must be a general restitution; and first, of the feudal\r\ndues which have been collected. They take of M. de Montmeyan's business\r\nagent all the money he has as compensation for that received by him\r\nduring fifteen years as a notary. A former consul of Brignolles had, in\r\n1775, inflicted penalties to the amount of 1,500 or 1,800 francs, which\r\nhad been given to the poor; this sum is taken from his strong box.\r\nMoreover, if consuls and law officers are wrongdoers, the title deeds,\r\nrent-rolls, and other documents by which they do their business\r\nare still worse. To the fire with all old writings--not only office\r\nregisters, but also, at Hyères, all the papers in the town hall and\r\nthose of the principal notary.--In the matter of papers none are\r\ngood but new ones--those which convey some discharge, quittance, or\r\nobligation to the advantage of the people. At Brignolles the owners of\r\nthe gristmills are constrained to execute a contract of sale by which\r\nthey convey their mills to the commune in consideration of 5,000 francs\r\nper annum, payable in ten years without interest--an arrangement which\r\nruins them. On seeing the contract signed the peasants shout and cheer,\r\nand so great is their faith in this piece of stamped paper that they at\r\nonce cause a mass of thanksgiving to be celebrated in the Cordeliers.\r\nFormidable omens these! Which mark the inward purpose, the determined\r\nwill, and the coming deeds of this rising power. If it prevails, its\r\nfirst work will be to destroy all ancient documents, all title deeds,\r\nrent-rolls, contracts, and claims to which force compels it to submit.\r\nBy force likewise it will draw up others to its own advantage, and the\r\nscribes who do it will be its own deputies and administrators whom it\r\nholds in its rude grasp.\r\n\r\nThose who are in high places are not alarmed; they even find that there\r\nis some good in the revolt, inasmuch as it compels the towns to suppress\r\nunjust taxation.[1132] The new Marseilles guard, formed of young men, is\r\nallowed to march to Aubagne, \"to insist that M. le lieutenant criminel\r\nand M. l'avocat du Roi release the prisoners.\" The disobedience of\r\nMarseilles, which refuses to receive the magistrates sent under letters\r\npatent to take testimony, is tolerated. And better still, in spite\r\nof the remonstrances of the parliament of Aix, a general amnesty is\r\nproclaimed; \"no one is excepted but a few of the leaders, to whom is\r\nallowed the liberty of leaving the kingdom.\" The mildness of the King\r\nand of the military authorities is admirable. It is admitted that the\r\npeople are children, that they err only through ignorance, that faith\r\nmust be had in their repentance, and, as soon as they return to order,\r\nthey must be received with paternal effusions.--The truth is, that the\r\nchild is a blind Colossus, exasperated by sufferings. hence whatever it\r\ntakes hold of is shattered--not only the local wheels of the provinces,\r\nwhich, if temporarily deranged, may be repaired, but even the incentive\r\nat the center which puts the rest in motion, and the destruction of\r\nwhich will throw the whole machinery into confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1101: Marmontel, \"Mémoires,\" II. 221.--Albert Babeau,\r\n\"Histoire de la Révolution Française,\" I. 91, 187.

PARIS UP TO THE 14TH OF JULY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--Mob recruits in the vicinity\r\n\r\n     Entry of vagabonds.--The number of paupers.\r\n\r\nINDEED it is in the center that the convulsive shocks are strongest.\r\nNothing is lacking to aggravate the insurrection--neither the liveliest\r\nprovocation to stimulate it, nor the most numerous bands to carry it\r\nout. The environs of Paris all furnish recruits for it; nowhere are\r\nthere so many miserable wretches, so many of the famished, and so many\r\nrebellious beings. Robberies of grain take place everywhere--at\r\nOrleans, at Cosne, at Rambouillet, at Jouy, at Pont-Saint-Maxence, at\r\nBray-sur-Seine, at Sens, at Nangis.[1201] Wheat flour is so scarce at\r\nMeudon, that every purchaser is ordered to buy at the same time an equal\r\nquantity of barley. At Viroflay, thirty women, with a rear-guard of men,\r\nstop on the main road vehicles, which they suppose to be loaded with\r\ngrain. At Montlhéry stones and clubs disperse seven brigades of the\r\npolice. An immense throng of eight thousand persons, women and men,\r\nprovided with bags, fall upon the grain exposed for sale. They force the\r\ndelivery to them of wheat worth 40 francs at 24 francs, pillaging the\r\nhalf of it and conveying it off without payment. \"The constabulary is\r\ndisheartened,\" writes the sub-delegate; \"the determination of the people\r\nis wonderful; I am frightened at what I have seen and heard.\"--After\r\nthe 13th of July, 1788, the day of the hail-storm, despair seized\r\nthe peasantry; well disposed as the proprietors may have been, it was\r\nimpossible to assist them. \"Not a workshop is open;[1202] the noblemen\r\nand the bourgeois, obliged to grant delays in the payment of their\r\nincomes, can give no work.\" Accordingly, \"the famished people are on\r\nthe point of risking life for life,\" and, publicly and boldly, they\r\nseek food wherever it can be found. At Conflans-Saint-Honorine, Eragny,\r\nNeuville, Chenevières, at Cergy, Pontoise, Ile-Adam, Presle, and\r\nBeaumont, men, women, and children, the hole parish, range the country,\r\nset snares, and destroy the burrows. \"The rumor is current that the\r\nGovernment, informed of the damage done by the game to cultivators,\r\nallows its destruction. . . and really the hares ravaged about a fifth\r\nof the crop. At first an arrest is made of nine of these poachers; but\r\nthey are released, \"taking circumstances into account.\" Consequently,\r\nfor two months, there is a slaughter on the property of the Prince de\r\nConti and of the Ambassador Mercy d'Argenteau; in default of bread\r\nthey eat rabbits.--Along with the abuse of property they are led, by a\r\nnatural impulse, to attack property itself. Near Saint-Denis the woods\r\nbelonging to the abbey are devastated. \"The farmers of the neighborhood\r\ncarry away loads of wood, drawn by four and five horses;\" the\r\ninhabitants of the villages of Ville-Parisis, Tremblay, Vert-Galant,\r\nVillepinte, sell it publicly, and threaten the wood-rangers with a\r\nbeating. On the 15th of June the damage is already estimated at 60,000\r\nlivres.--It makes little difference whether the proprietor has been\r\nbenevolent, like M. de Talaru,[1203] who had supported the poor on his\r\nestate at Issy the preceding winter. The peasants destroy the dike which\r\nconducts water to his communal mill; condemned by the parliament to\r\nrestore it, they declare that not only will they not obey. Should M. de\r\nTalaru try to rebuild it they will return with three hundred armed men,\r\nand tear it away the second time.\r\n\r\nFor those who are most compromised Paris is the nearest refuge. For the\r\npoorest and most exasperated, the door of nomadic life stands wide\r\nopen. Bands rise up around the capital, just as in countries where human\r\nsociety has not yet been formed, or has ceased to exist. During the\r\nfirst two weeks of May[1204] near Villejuif a band of five or six\r\nhundred vagabonds strive to force Bicêtre and approach Saint-Cloud. They\r\narrive from thirty, forty, and sixty leagues off, from Champagne, from\r\nLorraine, from the whole circuit of country devastated by the hailstorm.\r\nAll hover around Paris and are there engulfed as in a sewer, the\r\nunfortunate along with criminals, some to find work, others to beg and\r\nto rove about under the injurious prompting of hunger and the rumors\r\nof the public thoroughfares. During the last days of April,[1205] the\r\nclerks at the tollhouses note the entrance of \"a frightful number of\r\npoorly clad men of sinister aspect.\" During the first days of May a\r\nchange in the appearance of the crowd is remarked. There mingle in it\r\n\"a number of foreigners, from all countries, most of them in rags, armed\r\nwith big sticks, and whose very aspect announces what is to be feared\r\nfrom them.\" Already, before this final influx, the public sink is\r\nfull to overflowing. Think of the extraordinary and rapid increase of\r\npopulation in Paris, the multitude of artisans brought there by recent\r\ndemolition and constructions. Think of all the craftsmen whom the\r\nstagnation of manufactures, the augmentation of octrois, the rigor of\r\nwinter, and the dearness of bread have reduced to extreme distress.\r\nRemember that in 1786 \"two hundred thousand persons are counted whose\r\nproperty, all told, has not the intrinsic worth of fifty crowns.\"\r\nRemember that, from time immemorial, these have been at war with the\r\ncity watchmen. Remember that in 1789 there are twenty thousand poachers\r\nin the capital and that, to provide them with work, it is found\r\nnecessary to establish national workshops. Remember \"that twelve\r\nthousand are kept uselessly occupied digging on the hill of Montmartre,\r\nand paid twenty sous per day. Remember that the wharves and quays are\r\ncovered with them, that the Hôtel-de-Ville is invested by them, and\r\nthat, around the palace, they seem to be a reproach to the inactivity of\r\ndisarmed justice.\" Daily they grow bitter and excited around the doors\r\nof the bakeries, where, kept waiting a long time, they are not sure of\r\nobtaining bread. You can imagine the fury and the force with which they\r\nwill storm any obstacle to which their attention may be directed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The Press.\r\n\r\n     Excitement of the press and of opinion.--The people make\r\n     their choice.\r\n\r\nSuch an obstacle has been pointed out to them during the last two years,\r\nit is the Ministry, the Court, the Government, in short the entire\r\nancient régime. Whoever protests against it in favor of the people is\r\nsure to be followed as far, and perhaps even farther, than he chooses\r\nto lead.--The moment the Parliament of a large city refuses to register\r\nfiscal edicts it finds a riot at its service. On the 7th of June 1788,\r\nat Grenoble, tiles rain down on the heads of the soldiery, and the\r\nmilitary force is powerless. At Rennes, to put down the rebellious city,\r\nan army and after this a permanent camp of four regiments of infantry\r\nand two of cavalry, under the command of a Marshal of France, is\r\nrequired.[1206]--The following year, when the Parliaments now side\r\nwith the privileged class, the disturbances again begin, but this time\r\nagainst the Parliaments. In February 1789, at Besançon and at Aix, the\r\nmagistrates are hooted at, chased in the streets, besieged in the town\r\nhall, and obliged to conceal themselves or take to flight.--If such\r\nis the disposition in the provincial capitals, what must it be in the\r\ncapital of the kingdom? For a start, in the month of August, 1788, after\r\nthe dismissal of Brienne and Lamoignon, the mob, collected on the Place\r\nDauphine, constitutes itself judge, burns both ministers in effigy,\r\ndisperses the watch, and resists the troops: no sedition, as bloody as\r\nthis, had been seen for a century. Two days later, the riot bursts out\r\na second time; the people are seized with a resolve to go and burn the\r\nresidences of the two ministers and that of Dubois, the lieutenant of\r\npolice.--Clearly a new ferment has been infused among the ignorant and\r\nbrutal masses, and the new ideas are producing their effect. They have\r\nfor a long time imperceptibly been filtering downwards from layer\r\nto layer After having gained over the aristocracy, the whole of the\r\nlettered portion of the Third-Estate, the lawyers, the schools, all the\r\nyoung, they have insinuated themselves drop by drop and by a thousand\r\nfissures into the class which supports itself by the labor of its own\r\nhands. Noblemen, at their toilettes, have scoffed at Christianity, and\r\naffirmed the rights of man before their valets, hairdressers, purveyors,\r\nand all those that are in attendance upon them. Men of letters, lawyers,\r\nand attorneys have repeated, in the bitterest tone, the same diatribes\r\nand the same theories in the coffee-houses and in the restaurants, on\r\nthe promenades and in all public places. They have spoken out before\r\nthe lower class as if it were not present, and, from all this eloquence\r\npoured out without precaution, some bubbles besprinkle the brain of the\r\nartisan, the publican, the messenger, the shopkeeper, and the soldier.\r\n\r\nHence it is that a year suffices to convert mute discontent into\r\npolitical passion. From the 5th of July 1787, on the invitation of the\r\nKing, who convokes the States-General and demands advice from everybody,\r\nboth speech and the press alter in tone.[1207] Instead of general\r\nconversation of a speculative turn there is preaching, with a view\r\nto practical effect, sudden, radical, and close at hand, preaching as\r\nshrill and thrilling as the blast of a trumpet. Revolutionary pamphlets\r\nappear in quick succession: \"Qu'est-ce que le Tiers?\" by Sieyès;\r\n\"Mémoire pour le Peuple Français,\" by Cerutti; \"Considerations sur les\r\nIntérêts des Tiers-Etat,\" by Rabtau Saint-Etienne; \"Ma Pétition,\" by\r\nTarget; \"Les Droits des Etats-généraux,\" by M. d'Entraigues, and, a\r\nlittle later, \"La France libre,\" par Camille Desmoulins, and others by\r\nhundreds and thousands.[1208] All of which are repeated and amplified\r\nin the electoral assemblies, where new-made citizens come to declaim and\r\nincrease their own excitement.[1209] The unanimous, universal and daily\r\nshout rolls along from echo to echo, into barracks and into faubourgs,\r\ninto markets, workshops, and garrets. In the month of February, 1789,\r\nNecker avows \"that obedience is not to be found anywhere, and that\r\neven the troops are not to be relied on.\" In the month of May, the\r\nfisherwomen, and next the greengrocers, of the town market halls come to\r\nrecommend the interests of the people to the bodies of electors, and to\r\nsing rhymes in honor of the Third-Estate. In the month of June pamphlets\r\nare in all hands; \"even lackeys are poring over them at the gates\r\nof hotels.\" In the month of July, as the King is signing an order, a\r\npatriotic valet becomes alarmed and reads it over his shoulder.--There\r\nis no illusion here; it is not merely the bourgeoisie which ranges\r\nitself against the legal authorities and against the established regime.\r\nIt is the entire people as well. The craftsmen, the shopkeepers and\r\nthe domestics, workmen of every kind and degree, the mob underneath the\r\npeople, the vagabonds, street rovers, and beggars, the whole multitude,\r\nwhich, bound down by anxiety for its daily bread, had never lifted\r\nits eyes to look at the great social order of which it is the lowest\r\nstratum, and the whole weight of which it bears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--The Réveillon affair.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the people stirs, and the superposed scaffolding totters. It\r\nis the movement of a brute nature exasperated by want and maddened\r\nby suspicion.--Have paid hands, which are invisible goaded it on from\r\nbeneath? Contemporaries are convinced of this, and it is probably the\r\ncase.[1210] But the uproar made around the suffering brute would alone\r\nsuffice to make it shy, and explain its arousal.--On the 21st of April\r\nthe Electoral Assemblies have begun in Paris; there is one in each\r\nquarter, one for the clergy, one for the nobles, and one for the\r\nThird-Estate. Every day, for almost a month, files of electors are seen\r\npassing along the streets. Those of the first degree continue to meet\r\nafter having nominated those of the second: the nation must needs\r\nwatch its mandatories and maintain its imprescriptible rights. If this\r\nexercise of their rights has been delegated to them, they still belong\r\nto the nation, and it reserves to itself the privilege of interposing\r\nwhen it pleases. A pretension of this kind travels fast; immediately\r\nafter the Third-Estate of the Assemblies it reaches the Third-Estate\r\nof the streets. Nothing is more natural than the desire to lead one's\r\nleaders: the first time any dissatisfaction occurs, they lay hands on\r\nthose who halt and make them march on as directed. On a Saturday,\r\nApril 25th,[1211] a rumor is current that Réveillon, an elector\r\nand manufacturer of wall-paper, Rue Saint-Antoine, and Lerat, a\r\ncommissioner, have \"spoken badly\" at the Electoral Assembly of\r\nSainte-Marguerite. To speak badly means to speak badly of the people.\r\nWhat has Réveillon said? Nobody knows, but popular imagination with\r\nits terrible powers of invention and precision, readily fabricates or\r\nwelcomes a murderous phrase. He said that \"a working-man with a wife and\r\nchildren could live on fifteen sous a day.\" Such a man is a traitor, and\r\nmust be disposed of at once; \"all his belongings must be put to fire and\r\nsword.\" The rumor, it must be noted, is false.[1212] Réveillon pays\r\nhis poorest workman twenty-five sous a day, he provides work for three\r\nhundred and fifty, and, in spite of a dull season the previous winter,\r\nhe kept all on at the same rate of wages. He himself was once a workman,\r\nand obtained a medal for his inventions, and is benevolent and respected\r\nby all respectable persons.--All this avails nothing; bands of vagabonds\r\nand foreigners, who have just passed through the barriers, do not\r\nlook so closely into matters, while the Journeymen, the carters, the\r\ncobblers, the masons, the braziers, and the stone-cutters whom they\r\ngo to solicit in their lodgings are just as ignorant as they are. When\r\nirritation has accumulated, it breaks out haphazardly.\r\n\r\nJust at this time the clergy of Paris renounce their privileges in way\r\nof imposts,[1213] and the people, taking friends for adversaries, add in\r\ntheir invectives the name of the clergy to that of Réveillon. During\r\nthe whole of the day, and also during the leisure of Sunday, the\r\nfermentation increases; on Monday the 27th, another day of idleness and\r\ndrunkenness, the bands begin to move. Certain witnesses encounter one of\r\nthese in the Rue Saint-Sévérin, \"armed with clubs,\" and so numerous as\r\nto bar the passage. \"Shops and doors are closed on all sides, and the\r\npeople cry out, 'There's the revolt!'\" The seditious crowd belch out\r\ncurses and invectives against the clergy, \"and, catching sight of an\r\nabbé, shout 'Priest!'\" Another band parades an effigy of Réveillon\r\ndecorated with the ribbon of the order of St. Michael, which undergoes\r\nthe parody of a sentence and is burnt on the Place de Grève, after which\r\nthey threaten his house. Driven back by the guard, they invade that of\r\na manufacturer of saltpeter, who is his friend, and burn and smash his\r\neffects and furniture.[1214] It is only towards midnight that the crowd\r\nis dispersed and the insurrection is supposed to have ended. On the\r\nfollowing day it begins again with greater violence; for, besides the\r\nordinary stimulants of misery[1215] and the craving for license, they\r\nhave a new stimulant in the idea of a cause to defend, the conviction\r\nthat they are fighting \"for the Third-Estate.\" In a cause like this each\r\none should help himself; and all should help each other. \"We should be\r\nlost,\" one of them exclaimed, \"if we did not sustain each other.\" Strong\r\nin this belief, they sent deputations three times into the Faubourg\r\nSaint-Marceau to obtain recruits, and on their way, with uplifted clubs\r\nthey enrol, willingly or unwillingly, all they encounter. Others, at the\r\ngate of Saint-Antoine, arrest people who are returning from the races,\r\ndemanding of them if they are for the nobles or for the Third-Estate,\r\nand force women to descend from their vehicles and to cry \"Vive le\r\nTiers-Etat \"[1216]. Meanwhile the crowd has increased before Réveillon's\r\ndwelling; the thirty men on guard are unable to resist; the house\r\nis invaded and sacked from top to bottom; the furniture, provisions,\r\nclothing, registers, wagons, even the poultry in the back-yard, all\r\nis cast into blazing bonfires lighted in three different places; five\r\nhundred louis d'or, the ready money, and the silver plate are stolen.\r\nSeveral roam through the cellars, drink liquor or varnish at haphazard\r\nuntil they fall down dead drunk or expire in convulsions. Against\r\nthis howling horde, a corps of the watch, mounted and on foot, is seen\r\napproaching;[1217] also a hundred cavalry of the \"Royal Croats,\" the\r\nFrench Guards, and later on the Swiss Guards. \"Tiles and chimneys are\r\nrained down on the soldiers,\" who fire back four files at a time. The\r\nrioters, drunk with brandy and rage, defend themselves desperately\r\nfor several hours; more than two hundred are killed, and nearly three\r\nhundred are wounded; they are only put down by cannon, while the mob\r\nkeeps active until far into the night.--Towards eight in the evening, in\r\nthe rue Vieille-du-Temple, the Paris Guard continue to make charges in\r\norder to protect the doors which the miscreants try to force. Two doors\r\nare forced at half-past eleven o'clock in the Rue Saintonge and in the\r\nRue de Bretagne, that of a pork-dealer and that of a baker. Even to\r\nthis last wave of the outbreak which is subsiding we can distinguish the\r\nelements which have produced the insurrection, and which are about\r\nto produce the Revolution.--Starvation is one of these: in the Rue de\r\nBretagne the band robbing the baker's shop carries bread off to the\r\nwomen staying at the corner of the Rue Saintonge.--Brigandage is\r\nanother: in the middle of the night M. du Châtelet's spies, gliding\r\nalongside of a ditch, \"see a group of ruffians\" assembled beyond the\r\nBarrière du Trône, their leader, mounted on a little knoll, urging them\r\nto begin again; and the following days, on the highways, vagabonds are\r\nsaying to each other, \"We can do no more at Paris, because they are\r\ntoo sharp on the look-out; let us go to Lyons!\" There are, finally, the\r\npatriots: on the evening of the insurrection, between the Pont-au-Change\r\nand the Pont-Marie, the half-naked ragamuffins, besmeared with dirt,\r\nbearing along their hand-barrows, are fully alive to their cause; they\r\nbeg alms in a loud tone of voice, and stretch out their hats to the\r\npassers, saying, \"Take pity on this poor Third-Estate!\"--The starving,\r\nthe ruffians, and the patriots, all form one body, and henceforth\r\nmisery, crime, and public spirit unite to provide an ever-ready\r\ninsurrection for the agitators who desire to raise one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--The Palais-Royal.\r\n\r\nBut the agitators are already in permanent session. The Palais-Royal is\r\nan open-air club where, all day and even far into the night, one excites\r\nthe other and urges on the crowd to blows. In this enclosure, protected\r\nby the privileges of the House of Orleans, the police dare not enter.\r\nSpeech is free, and the public who avail themselves of this freedom seem\r\npurposely chosen to abuse it.--The public and the place are adapted to\r\neach other.[1218] The Palais-Royal, the center of prostitution, of\r\nplay, of idleness, and of pamphlets, attracts the whole of that uprooted\r\npopulation which floats about in a great city, and which, without\r\noccupation or home, lives only for curiosity or for pleasure--the\r\nfrequenters of the coffee-houses, the runners for gambling halls,\r\nadventurers, and social outcasts, the runaway children or forlorn\r\nhopefuls of literature, arts, and the bar, attorneys' clerks, students\r\nof the institutions of higher learning, the curious, loungers,\r\nstrangers, and the occupants of furnished lodgings, these amounting,\r\nit is said, to forty thousand in Paris. They fill the garden and the\r\ngalleries; \"one would hardly find here one of what were called the\r\n\"Six Bodies,\"[1219] a bourgeois settled down and occupied with his\r\nown affairs, a man whom business and family cares render serious and\r\ninfluential. There is no place here for industrious and orderly bees; it\r\nis the rendezvous of political and literary drones. They flock into it\r\nfrom every quarter of Paris, and the tumultuous, buzzing swarm covers\r\nthe ground like an overturned hive. \"Ten thousand people,\" writes Arthur\r\nYoung,[1220] \"have been all this day in the Palais-Royal;\" the press\r\nis so great that an apple thrown from a balcony on the moving floor of\r\nheads would not reach the ground. The condition of these heads may\r\nbe imagined; they are emptier of ballast than any in France, the\r\nmost inflated with speculative ideas, the most excitable and the most\r\nexcited. In this pell-mell of improvised politicians no one knows who\r\nis speaking; nobody is responsible for what he says. Each is there as\r\nin the theater, unknown among the unknown, requiring sensational\r\nimpressions and strong emotions, a prey to the contagion of the passions\r\naround him, borne along in the whirl of sounding phrases, of ready-made\r\nnews, growing rumors, and other exaggerations by which fanatics keep\r\noutdoing each other. There are shouting, tears, applause, stamping and\r\nclapping, as at the performance of a tragedy; one or another individual\r\nbecomes so inflamed and hoarse that he dies on the spot with fever and\r\nexhaustion. In vain has Arthur Young been accustomed to the tumult of\r\npolitical liberty; he is dumb-founded at what he sees.[1221] According\r\nto him, the excitement is \"incredible. . . . We think sometimes that\r\nDebrett's or Stockdale's shops at London are crowded; but they are mere\r\ndeserts compared to Desenne's and some others here, in which one can\r\nscarcely squeeze from the door to the counter. . . . Every hour produces\r\nits pamphlet; 13 came out to-day, 16 yesterday, and 92 last week. 95% of\r\nthese productions are in favor of liberty;\" and by liberty is meant the\r\nextinction of privileges, numerical sovereignty, the application of\r\nthe Contrat-Social, \"The Republic\", and even more besides, a universal\r\nleveling, permanent anarchy, and even the jacquerie. Camille Desmoulins,\r\none of the orators, commonly there, announces it and urges it in precise\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n\"Now that the animal is in the trap, let him be battered to death...\r\nNever will the victors have a richer prey. Forty thousand palaces,\r\nmansions, and châteaux, two-fifth of the property of France, will be\r\nthe recompense of valor. Those who pretend to be the conquerors will be\r\nconquered in turn. The nation shall be purged.\"\r\n\r\nHere, in advance, is the program of the Reign of Terror.\r\n\r\nNow all this is not only read, but declaimed, amplified, and turned\r\nto practical account. In front of the coffee-houses \"those who have\r\nstentorian lungs relieve each other every evening.\"[1222] \"They get\r\nup on a chair or a table, they read the strongest articles on current\r\naffairs, . . . the eagerness with which they are heard, and the thunder\r\nof applause they receive for every sentiment of more than common\r\nhardiness or violence against the present Government, cannot easily\r\nbe imagined.\" \"Three days ago a child of four years, well taught and\r\nintelligent, was promenaded around the garden, in broad daylight, at\r\nleast twenty times, borne on the shoulders of a street porter, crying\r\nout, 'Verdict of the French people: Polignac exiled one hundred leagues\r\nfrom Paris; Condé the same; Conti the same; Artois the same; the\r\nQueen,--I dare not write it.'\" A hall made of boards in the middle of\r\nthe Palais-Royal is always full, especially of young men, who carry\r\non their deliberations in parliamentary fashion: in the evening the\r\npresident invites the spectators to come forward and sign motions\r\npassed during the day, and of which the originals are placed in the Café\r\nFoy.[1223] They count on their fingers the enemies of the country; \"and\r\nfirst two Royal Highnesses (Monsieur and the Count d'Artois), three Most\r\nSerene Highnesses (the Prince de Condé, Duc de Bourbon, and the Prince\r\nde Conti), one favorite (Madame de Polignac), MM. de Vandreuil, de la\r\nTrémoille, du Châtelet, de Villedeuil, de Barentin, de la Galaisière,\r\nVidaud de la Tour, Berthier, Foulon, and also M. Linguet.\" Placards are\r\nposted demanding the pillory on the Pont-Neuf for the Abbeé Maury.\r\nOne speaker proposes \"to burn the house of M. d'Espréménil, his wife,\r\nchildren and furniture, and himself: this is passed unanimously.\"--No\r\nopposition is tolerated. One of those present having manifested some\r\nhorror at such sanguinary motions, \"is seized by the collar, obliged to\r\nkneel down, to make an apology, and to kiss the ground. The punishment\r\ninflicted on children is given to him; he is ducked repeatedly in one of\r\nthe fountain-basins, after which they him over to the mob, who roll him\r\nin the mud.\" On the following day an ecclesiastic is trodden under foot,\r\nand flung from hand to hand. A few days after, on the 22nd of June,\r\nthere are two similar events. The sovereign mob exercises all the\r\nfunctions of sovereign authority, with those of the legislator those of\r\nthe judge, and those of the judge with those of the executioner.--Its\r\nidols are sacred; if any one fails to show them respect he is guilty of\r\nlése-majesté, and at once punished. In the first week of July, an abbé\r\nwho speaks ill of Necker is flogged; a woman who insults the bust of\r\nNecker is stripped by the fishwomen, and beaten until she is covered\r\nwith blood. War is declared against suspicious uniforms. \"On the\r\nappearance of a hussar,\" writes Desmoulins, \"they shout, 'There goes\r\nPunch!' and the stone-cutters fling stones at him. Last night two\r\nofficers of the hussars, MM. de Sombreuil and de Polignac, came to the\r\nPalais-Royal. . . chairs were flung at them, and they would have been\r\nknocked down if they had not run away. The day before yesterday they\r\nseized a spy of the police and gave him a ducking in the fountain. They\r\nran him down like a stag, hustled him, pelted him with stones, struck\r\nhim with canes, forced one of his eyes out of its socket, and finally,\r\nin spite of his entreaties and cries for mercy, plunged him a second\r\ntime in the fountain. His torments lasted from noon until half-past\r\nfive o'clock, and he had about ten thousand executioners.\"--Consider\r\nthe effect of such a focal center at a time like this. A new power has\r\nsprung up alongside the legal powers, a legislature of the highways\r\nand public squares, anonymous, irresponsible, without restraint. It\r\nis driven onward by coffeehouse theories, by strong emotions and\r\nthe vehemence of mountebanks, while the bare arms which have just\r\naccomplished the work of destruction in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, form\r\nits bodyguard and ministerial cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--Popular mobs become a political force.\r\n\r\n     Pressure on the Assembly.--Defection of the soldiery.\r\n\r\nThis is the dictatorship of a mob, and its proceedings, conforming to\r\nits nature, consist in acts of violence, wherever it finds resistance,\r\nit strikes.--The people of Versailles, in the streets and at the\r\ndoors of the Assembly, daily \"come and insult those whom they call\r\naristocrats.\"[1224] On Monday, June 22nd, \"d'Espréménil barely escapes\r\nbeing knocked down; the Abbé Maury. . . owes his escape to the strength\r\nof a curé, who takes him up in his arms and tosses him into the carriage\r\nof the Archbishop of Arles.\" On the 23rd, \"the Archbishop of Paris and\r\nthe Keeper of the Seals are hooted, railed at, scoffed at, and derided,\r\nuntil they almost sink with shame and rage.\" So formidable is the\r\ntempest of rage with which they are greeted, that Passeret, the King's\r\nsecretary, who accompanies the minister, dies of the excitement that\r\nvery day. On the 24th, the Bishop of Beauvais is almost knocked down by\r\na stone striking him on the head. On the 25th, the Archbishop of Paris\r\nis saved only by the speed of his horses, the multitude pursuing him and\r\npelting him with stones. His mansion is besieged, the windows are all\r\nshattered, and, notwithstanding the intervention of the French Guards,\r\nthe peril is so great that he is obliged to promise that he will join\r\nthe deputies of the Third-Estate. This is the way in which the rude hand\r\nof the people effects a reunion of the Orders. It bears as heavily on\r\nits own representatives as on its adversaries. \"Although our hall was\r\nclosed to the public,\" says Bailly, \"there were always more than six\r\nhundred spectators.\"[1225] These were not respectful and silent, but\r\nactive and noisy, mingling with the deputies, raising their hands to\r\nvote in all cases, taking part in the deliberations, by their applause\r\nand hisses: a collateral Assembly which often imposes its own will on\r\nthe other. They take note of and put down the names of their opponents,\r\ntransmit them to the chair-bearers in attendance at the entrance of\r\nthe hall, and from them to the mob waiting for the departure of the\r\ndeputies, these names are from now considered as the names of public\r\nenemies.[1226] Lists are made out and printed, and, at the Palais-Royal\r\nin the evening, they become the lists of the proscribed.--It is under\r\nthis brutal pressure that many decrees are passed, and, amongst them,\r\nthat by which the commons declare themselves the National Assembly\r\nand assume supreme power. The night before, Malouet had proposed to\r\nascertain, by a preliminary vote, on which side the majority was. In an\r\ninstant all those against had gathered around him to the number of three\r\nhundred. \"Upon which a mans springs out from the galleries, falls upon\r\nhim and takes him by the collar exclaiming, 'Hold your tongue, you false\r\ncitizen!'\" Malouet is released and the guard comes forward, \"but terror\r\nhas spread through the hall, threats are uttered against opponents, and\r\nthe next day we were only ninety.\" Moreover, the lists of their names\r\nhad been circulated; some of them, deputies from Paris, went to see\r\nBailly that very evening. One amongst them, \"a very honest man and good\r\npatriot,\" had been told that his house was to be set on fire. Now his\r\nwife had just given birth to a child, and the slightest tumult\r\nbefore the house would have been fatal. Such arguments are decisive.\r\nConsequently, three days afterwards, at the Tennis-court, but one\r\ndeputy, Martin d'Auch, dares to write the word \"opposing\" after his\r\nname. Insulted by many of colleagues, \"at once denounced to the people\r\nwho had collected at the entrance of the building, he is obliged to\r\nescape by a side door to avoid being cut to pieces,\" and, for several\r\ndays, to keep away from the meetings.[1227]--Owing to this intervention\r\nof the galleries the radical minority, numbering about thirty,[1228]\r\nlead the majority, and they do not allow them to free themselves.--On\r\nthe 28th of May, Malouet, having demanded a secret session to discuss\r\nthe conciliatory measures which the King had proposed, the galleries\r\nhoot at him, and a deputy, M. Bourche, addresses him in very plain\r\nterms. \"You must know, sir, that we are deliberating here in the\r\npresence of our masters, and that we must account to them for our\r\nopinions.\" This is the doctrine of the Contrat-Social. Through timidity,\r\nfear of the Court and of the privileged class, through optimism and\r\nfaith in human nature, through enthusiasm and the necessity of adhering\r\nto previous actions, the deputies, who are novices, provincial, and\r\ngiven up to theories, neither dare nor know how to escape from the\r\ntyranny of the prevailing dogma.--Henceforth it becomes the law. All\r\nthe Assemblies, the Constituent, the Legislative, the Convention,[1229]\r\nsubmit to it entirely. The public in the galleries is the admitted\r\nrepresentatives of the people, under the same title, and even under\r\na higher title, than the deputies. Now, this public is that of the\r\nPalais-Royal, consisting of strangers, idlers, lovers of novelties,\r\nParis romancers, leaders of the coffee-houses, the future pillars of the\r\nclubs, in short, the wild enthusiasts among the middle-class, just as\r\nthe crowd which threatens doors and throws stones is recruited from\r\namong the wild enthusiasts of the lowest class. Thus by an involuntary\r\nselection, the faction which constitutes itself a public power is\r\ncomposed of nothing but violent minds and violent hands. Spontaneously\r\nand without previous concert dangerous fanatics are joined with\r\ndangerous brutes, and in the increasing discord between the legal\r\nauthorities this is the illegal league which is certain to overthrow\r\nall.\r\n\r\nWhen a commanding general sits in council with his staff-officers and\r\nhis counselors, and discusses the plan of a campaign, the chief public\r\ninterest is that discipline should remain intact, and that intruders,\r\nsoldiers, or menials, should not throw the weight of their turbulence\r\nand thoughtlessness into the scales which have to be cautiously\r\nand firmly held by their chiefs. This was the express demand of the\r\nGovernment;[1230] but the demand was not regarded; and against the\r\npersistent usurpation of the multitude nothing is left to it but the\r\nemployment of force. But force itself is slipping from its hands, while\r\ngrowing disobedience, like a contagion, after having gained the people\r\nis spreading among the troops.--From the 23rd of June,[1231] two\r\ncompanies of the French Guards refused to do duty. Confined to their\r\nbarracks, they on the 27th break out, and henceforth \"they are seen\r\nevery evening entering the Palais-Royal, marching in double file.\" They\r\nknow the place well; it is the general rendezvous of the abandoned women\r\nwhose lovers and parasites they are.[1232] \"The patriots all gather\r\naround them, treat them to ice cream and wine, and debauch them in the\r\nface of their officers.\"--To this, moreover, must be added the fact that\r\ntheir colonel, M. du Châtelet, has long been odious to them, that he has\r\nfatigued them with forced drills, worried them and diminished the number\r\nof their sergeants; that he suppressed the school for the education of\r\nthe children of their musicians; that he uses the stick in punishing the\r\nmen, and picks quarrels with them about their appearance, their board,\r\nand their clothing. This regiment is lost to discipline: a secret\r\nsociety has been formed in it, and the soldiers have pledged themselves\r\nto their ensigns not to act against the National Assembly. Thus the\r\nconfederation between them and the Palais-Royal is established.--On the\r\n30th of June, eleven of their leaders, taken off to the Abbaye, write to\r\nclaim their assistance. A young man mounts a chair in front of the Café\r\nFoy and reads their letter aloud; a band sets out on the instant, forces\r\nthe gate with a sledge-hammer and iron bars, brings back the prisoners\r\nin triumph, gives them a feast in the garden and mounts guard around\r\nthem to prevent their being re-taken.--When disorders of this kind go\r\nunpunished, order cannot be maintained; in fact, on the morning of the\r\n14th of July, five out of six battalions had deserted.--As to the other\r\ncorps, they are no better and are also seduced. \"Yesterday,\" Desmoulins\r\nwrites, \"the artillery regiment followed the example of the French\r\nGuards, overpowering the sentinels and coming over to mingle with\r\nthe patriots in the Palais-Royal. . .. We see nothing but the rabble\r\nattaching themselves to soldiers whom they chance to encounter. 'Allons,\r\nVive le Tiers-Etat!' and they lead them off to a tavern to drink the\r\nhealth of the Commons.\" Dragoons tell the officers who are marching\r\nthem to Versailles: \"We obey you, but you may tell the ministers on our\r\narrival that if we are ordered to use the least violence against our\r\nfellow-citizens, the first shot shall be for you.\" At the Invalides\r\ntwenty men, ordered to remove the cocks and ramrods from the guns stored\r\nin a threatened arsenal, devote six hours to rendering twenty guns\r\nuseless; their object is to keep them intact for plunder and for the\r\narming of the people.\r\n\r\nIn short, the largest portion of the army has deserted. However kind\r\na superior officer might be, the fact of his being a superior officer\r\nsecures for him the treatment of an enemy. The governor, \"M. de\r\nSombreuil, against whom these people could utter no reproach,\" will soon\r\nsee his artillerists point their guns at his apartment, and will just\r\nescape being hung on the iron-railings by their own hands. Thus the\r\nforce which is brought forward to suppress insurrection only serves to\r\nfurnish it with recruits. And even worse, for the display of arms\r\nthat was relied on to restrain the mob, furnished the instigation to\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--July 13th and 14th 1789.\r\n\r\nThe fatal moment has arrived; it is no longer a government which falls\r\nthat it may give way to another; it is all government which ceases to\r\nexist in order to make way for an intermittent despotism, for factions\r\nblindly impelled on by enthusiasm, credulity, misery, and fear.[1233]\r\nLike a tame elephant suddenly become wild again, the mob throws off it\r\nordinary driver, and the new guides who it tolerates perched on its neck\r\nare there simply for show. In future it will move along as it pleases,\r\nfreed from control, and abandoned to its own feelings, instincts, and\r\nappetites.--Apparently, there was no desire to do more than anticipate\r\nits aberrations. The King has forbidden all violence; the commanders\r\norder the troops not to fire;[1234] but the excited and wild animal\r\ntakes all precautions for insults; in future, it intends to be its own\r\nconductor, and, to begin, it treads its guides under foot.--On the 12th\r\nof July, near noon,[1235] on the news of the dismissal of Necker, a cry\r\nof rage arises in the Palais-Royal; Camille Desmoulins, mounted on\r\na table, announces that the Court meditates \"a St. Bartholomew of\r\npatriots.\" The crowd embrace him, adopt the green cockade which he has\r\nproposed, and oblige the dancing-saloons and theaters to close in sign\r\nof mourning: they hurry off to the residence of Curtius, and take the\r\nbusts of the Duke of Orleans and of Necker and carry them about in\r\ntriumph.--Meanwhile, the dragoons of the Prince de Lambesc, drawn up on\r\nthe Place Louis-Quinze, find a barricade of chairs at the entrance\r\nof the Tuileries, and are greeted with a shower of stones and\r\nbottles.[1236] Elsewhere, on the Boulevard, before the Hôtel\r\nMontmorency, some of the French Guards, escaped from their barracks,\r\nfired on a loyal detachment of the \"Royal Allemand.\"--The alarm bell is\r\nsounding on all sides, the shops where arms are sold are pillaged,\r\nand the Hôtel-de-Ville is invaded; fifteen or sixteen well-disposed\r\nelectors, who meet there, order the districts to be assembled and\r\narmed.--The new sovereign, the people in arms and in the street, has\r\ndeclared himself.\r\n\r\nThe dregs of society at once come to the surface. During the night\r\nbetween the 12th and 13th of July,[1237] \"all the barriers, from the\r\nFaubourg Saint-Antoine to the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, besides those of\r\nthe Faubourgs Saint-Marcel and Saint-Jacques, are forced and set on\r\nfire.\" There is no longer an octroi; the city is without a revenue just\r\nat the moment when it is obliged to make the heaviest expenditures; but\r\nthis is of no consequence to the mob, which, above all things, wants\r\nto have cheap wine. \"Ruffians, armed with pikes and sticks, proceed\r\nin several parties to give up to pillage the houses of those who are\r\nregarded as enemies to the public welfare.\" \"They go from door to door\r\ncrying, 'Arms and bread!' During this fearful night, the bourgeoisie\r\nkept themselves shut up, each trembling at home for himself and those\r\nbelonging to him.\" On the following day, the 13th, the capital appears\r\nto be given up to bandits and the lowest of the low. One of the\r\nbands hews down the gate of the Lazarists, destroys the library and\r\nclothes-presses, the pictures, the windows and laboratory, and rushes\r\nto the cellars; where it staves in the casks and gets drunk: twenty-four\r\nhours after this, about thirty of them are found dead and dying, drowned\r\nin wine, men and women, one of these being at the point of childbirth.\r\nIn front of the house[1238] the street is full of the wreckage, and of\r\nruffians who hold in their hands, \"some, eatables, others a jug, forcing\r\nthe passers-by to drink, and pouring out wine to all comers. Wine\r\nruns down into the gutter, and the scent of it fills the air;\" it is a\r\ndrinking bout: meanwhile they carry away the grain and flour which the\r\nmonks kept on hand according to law, fifty-two loads of it being\r\ntaken to the market. Another troop comes to La Force, to deliver those\r\nimprisoned for debt; a third breaks into the Garde Meuble, carrying away\r\nvaluable arms and armour. Mobs assemble before the hotel of Madame de\r\nBreteuil and the Palais-Bourbon, which they intend to ransack, in order\r\nto punish their proprietors. M. de Crosne, one of the most liberal and\r\nmost respected men of Paris, but, unfortunately for himself a lieutenant\r\nof the police, is pursued, escaping with difficulty, and his hotel is\r\nsacked.--During the night between the 13th and 14th of May, the baker's\r\nshops and the wine shops are pillaged; \"men of the vilest class, armed\r\nwith guns, pikes, and turnspits, make people open their doors and give\r\nthem something to eat and drink, as well as money and arms.\" Vagrants,\r\nragged men, several of them \"almost naked,\" and \"most of them armed\r\nlike savages, and of hideous appearance;\" they are \"such as one does not\r\nremember to have seen in broad daylight;\" many of them are strangers,\r\ncome from nobody knows where.[1239] It is stated that there were\r\n50,000 of them, and that they had taken possession of the principal\r\nguard-houses.\r\n\r\nDuring these two days and nights, says Bailly, \"Paris ran the risk of\r\nbeing pillaged, and was only saved from the marauders by the National\r\nGuard.\" Already, in the open street,[1240] \"these creatures tore off\r\nwomen's shoes and earrings,\" and the robbers were beginning to have\r\nfull sway.--Fortunately the militia organized itself and the principal\r\ninhabitants and gentlemen enrolled themselves; 48,000 men are formed\r\ninto battalions and companies; the bourgeoisie buy guns of the vagabonds\r\nfor three livres apiece, and sabers or pistols for twelve sous. At last,\r\nsome of the offenders are hung on the spot, and others disarmed, and\r\nthe insurrection again becomes political. But, whatever its object, it\r\nremains always wild, because it is in the hands of the mob. Dusaulx, its\r\npanegyrist, confesses[1241] that \"he thought he was witnessing the total\r\ndissolution of society.\" There is no leader, no management. The electors\r\nwho have converted themselves into the representatives of Paris seem to\r\ncommand the crowd, but it is the crowd which commands them. One of them,\r\nLegrand, to save the Hôtel-de-Ville, has no other resource but to send\r\nfor six barrels of gun-powder, and to declare to the assailants that\r\nhe is about to blow everything into the air. The commandant whom they\r\nthemselves have chosen, M. de Salles, has twenty bayonets at his breast\r\nduring a quarter of an hour, and, more than once, the whole committee is\r\nnear being massacred. Let the reader imagine, on the premises where the\r\ndiscussions are going on, and petitions are being made, \"a concourse of\r\nfifteen hundred men pressed by a hundred thousand others who are forcing\r\nan entrance,\" the wainscoting cracking, the benches upset one over\r\nanother, the enclosure of the bureau pushed back against the president's\r\nchair, a tumult such as to bring to mind 'the day of judgment,\" the\r\ndeath-shrieks, songs, yells, and \"people beside themselves, for the most\r\npart not knowing where they are nor what they want.\"--Each district\r\nis also a petty center, while the Palais-Royal is the main center.\r\nPropositions, \"accusations, and deputations travel to and fro from one\r\nto the other, along with the human torrent which is obstructed or rushes\r\nahead with no other guide than its own inclination and the chances\r\nof the way. One wave gathers here and another there, their strategy\r\nconsisting in pushing and in being pushed. Yet, their entrance is\r\neffected only because they are let in. If they get into the Invalides it\r\nis owing to the connivance of the soldiers.--At the Bastille, firearms\r\nare discharged from ten in the morning to five in the evening against\r\nwalls forty feet high and thirty feet thick, and it is by chance that\r\none of their shots reaches an invalid on the towers. They are treated\r\nthe same as children whom one wishes to hurt as little as possible. The\r\ngovernor, on the first summons to surrender, orders the cannon to be\r\nwithdrawn from the embrasures; he makes the garrison swear not to fire\r\nif it is not attacked; he invites the first of the deputations to lunch;\r\nhe allows the messenger dispatched from the Hôtel-de-Ville to inspect\r\nthe fortress; he receives several discharges without returning them, and\r\nlets the first bridge be carried without firing a shot.[1242] When, at\r\nlength, he does fire, it is at the last extremity, to defend the second\r\nbridge, and after having notified the assailants that he is going to do\r\nso. In short, his forbearance and patience are excessive, in conformity\r\nwith the humanity of the times. The people, in turn, are infatuated\r\nwith the novel sensations of attack and resistance, with the smell of\r\ngunpowder, with the excitement of the contest; all they can think of\r\ndoing is to rush against the mass of stone, their expedients being on a\r\nlevel with their tactics. A brewer fancies that he can set fire to this\r\nblock of masonry by pumping over it spikenard and poppy-seed oil mixed\r\nwith phosphorus. A young carpenter, who has some archaeological notions,\r\nproposes to construct a catapult. Some of them think that they have\r\nseized the governor's daughter, and want to burn her in order to make\r\nthe father surrender. Others set fire to a projecting mass of buildings\r\nfilled with straw, and thus close up the passage. \"The Bastille was not\r\ntaken by main force,\" says the brave Elie, one of the combatants; \"it\r\nsurrendered before even it was attacked,\"[1243] by capitulation, on\r\nthe promise that no harm should be done to anybody. The garrison, being\r\nperfectly secure, had no longer the heart to fire on human beings while\r\nthemselves risking nothing,[1244] and, on the other hand, they were\r\nunnerved by the sight of the immense crowd. Eight or nine hundred\r\nmen only[1245] were concerned in the attack, most of them workmen or\r\nshopkeepers belonging to the faubourg, tailors, wheelwrights, mercers\r\nand wine-dealers, mixed with the French Guards. The Place de la\r\nBastille, however, and all the streets in the vicinity, were crowded\r\nwith the curious who came to witness the sight; \"among them,\" says\r\na witness,[1246] \"were a number of fashionable women of very good\r\nappearance, who had left their carriages at some distance.\" To the\r\nhundred and twenty men of the garrison looking down from their parapets\r\nit seemed as though all Paris had come out against them. It is they,\r\nalso, who lower the drawbridge an introduce the enemy: everybody has\r\nlost his head, the besieged as well as the besiegers, the latter more\r\ncompletely because they are intoxicated with the sense of victory.\r\nScarcely have they entered when they begin the work of destruction, and\r\nthe latest arrivals shoot at random those that come earlier; \"each\r\none fires without heeding where or on whom his shot tells.\" Sudden\r\nomnipotence and the liberty to kill are a wine too strong for human\r\nnature; giddiness is the result; men see red, and their frenzy ends in\r\nferocity.\r\n\r\nFor the peculiarity of a popular insurrection is that nobody obeys\r\nanybody; the bad passions are free as well as the generous ones; heroes\r\nare unable to restrain assassins. Elie, who is the first to enter the\r\nfortress, Cholat, Hulin, the brave fellows who are in advance, the\r\nFrench Guards who are cognizant of the laws of war, try to keep their\r\nword of honor; but the crowd pressing on behind them know not whom to\r\nstrike, and they strike at random. They spare the Swiss soldiers who\r\nhave fired at them, and who, in their blue smocks, seem to them to\r\nbe prisoners; on the other hand, by way of compensation, they fall\r\nfuriously on the invalides who opened the gates to them; the man who\r\nprevented the governor from blowing up the fortress has his wrist\r\nsevered by the blow of a saber, is twice pierced with a sword and is\r\nhung, and the hand which had saved one of the districts of Paris is\r\npromenaded through the streets in triumph. The officers are dragged\r\nalong and five of them are killed, with three soldiers, on the spot, or\r\non the way. During the long hours of firing, the murderous instinct has\r\nbecome aroused, and the wish to kill, changed into a fixed idea,\r\nspreads afar among the crowd which has hitherto remained inactive. It is\r\nconvinced by its own clamor; a hue and cry is all that it now needs; the\r\nmoment one strikes, all want to strike. \"Those who had no arms,\" says\r\nan officer, \"threw stones at me;[1247] the women ground their teeth and\r\nshook their fists at me. Two of my men had already been assassinated\r\nbehind me. I finally got to within some hundreds of paces of the\r\nHôtel-de-Ville, amidst a general cry that I should be hung, when a head,\r\nstuck on a pike, was presented to me to look at, while at. the same\r\nmoment I was told that it was that of M. de Launay,\" the governor.--The\r\nlatter, on going out, had received the cut of a sword on his right\r\nshoulder; on reaching the Rue Saint-Antoine \"everybody pulled his hair\r\nout and struck him.\" Under the arcade of Saint-Jean he was already\r\n\"severely wounded.\" Around him, some said, \"his head ought to be struck\r\noff;\" others, \"let him be hung;\" and others, \"he ought to be tied to\r\na horse's tail.\" Then, in despair, and wishing to put an end to his\r\ntorments, he cried out, \"Kill me,\" and, in struggling, kicked one of the\r\nmen who held him in the lower abdomen. On the instant he is pierced with\r\nbayonets, dragged in the gutter, and, striking his corpse, they exclaim,\r\n\"He's a scurvy wretch (galeux) and a monster who has betrayed us; the\r\nnation demands his head to exhibit to the public,\" and the man who\r\nwas kicked is asked to cut it off.--This man, an unemployed cook, a\r\nsimpleton who \"went to the Bastille to see what was going on,\" thinks\r\nthat as it is the general opinion, the act is patriotic, and even\r\nbelieves that he \"deserves a medal for destroying a monster.\" Taking a\r\nsaber which is lent to him, he strikes the bare neck, but the dull\r\nsaber not doing its work, he takes a small black-handled knife from his\r\npocket, and, \"as in his capacity of cook he knows how to cut meat,\" he\r\nfinishes the operation successfully. Then, placing the head on the end\r\nof a three-pronged pitchfork, and accompanied by over two hundred\r\narmed men, \"not counting the mob,\" he marches along, and, in the Rue\r\nSaint-Honoré, he has two inscriptions attached to the head, to indicate\r\nwithout mistake whose head it is.--They grow merry over it: after filing\r\nalongside of the Palais-Royal, the procession arrives at the Pont-Neuf,\r\nwhere, before the statue of Henry IV., they bow the head three times,\r\nsaying, \"Salute thy master!\"--This is the last joke: it is to be found\r\nin every triumph, and inside the butcher, we find the rogue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--Murders of Foulon and Berthier.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at the Palais-Royal, other buffoons, who with the levity of\r\ngossips sport with lives as freely as with words, have drawn u. During\r\nthe night between the 13th and 14th of July, a list of proscriptions,\r\ncopies of which are hawked about. Care is taken to address one of\r\nthem to each of the persons designated, the Comte d'Artois, Marshal\r\nde Broglie, the Prince de Lambesc, Baron de Bezenval, MM. de Breteuil,\r\nFoulon, Berthier, Maury, d'Espréménil, Lefèvre d'Amécourt, and others\r\nbesides.[1248] A reward is promised to whoever will bring their heads to\r\nthe Café de Caveau. Here are names for the unchained multitude; all\r\nthat now is necessary is that some band should encounter a man who is\r\ndenounced; he will go as far as the lamppost at the street corner, but\r\nnot beyond it.--Throughout the day of the 14th, this improvised tribunal\r\nholds a permanent session, and follows up its decisions with its\r\nactions. M. de Flesselles, provost of the merchants and president of\r\nthe electors at the Hôtel-de-Ville, having shown himself somewhat\r\nlukewarm,[1249] the Palais-Royal declares him a traitor and sends him\r\noff to be hung. On the way a young man fells him with a pistol-shot,\r\nothers fall upon his body, while his head, borne upon a pike, goes to\r\njoin that of M. de Launay.--Equally deadly accusations and of equally\r\nspeedy execution float in the air and from every direction. \"On the\r\nslightest pretext,\" says an elector, \"they denounced to us those whom\r\nthey thought opposed to the Revolution, which already signified the same\r\nas enemies of the State. Without any investigation, there was only talk\r\nof the seizure of their persons, the ruin of their homes, and the razing\r\nof their houses. One young man exclaimed: 'Follow me at once, let us\r\nstart off at once to Bezenval's!'\"--Their brains are so frightened, and\r\ntheir minds so distrustful, that at every step in the streets \"one's\r\nname has to be given, one's profession declared, one's residence, and\r\none's intentions. . .. One can neither enter nor leave Paris without\r\nbeing suspected of treason.\" The Prince de Montbarrey, advocate of the\r\nnew ideas, and his wife, are stopped in their carriage at the barrier,\r\nand are on the point of being cut to pieces. A deputy of the nobles, on\r\nhis way to the National Assembly, is seized in his cab and conducted to\r\nthe Place de Grève; the corpse of M. de Launay is shown to him, and he\r\nis told that he is to be treated in the same fashion.--Every life hangs\r\nby a thread, and, on the following days, when the King had sent away\r\nhis troops, dismissed his Ministers, recalled Necker, and granted\r\neverything, the danger remains just as great. The multitude, abandoned\r\nto the revolutionaries and to itself, continues the same bloody antics,\r\nwhile the municipal chiefs[1250] whom it has elected, Bailly, Mayor of\r\nParis, and Lafayette, commandant of the National Guard, are obliged to\r\nuse cunning, to implore, to throw themselves between the multitude and\r\nthe unfortunates whom they wish to destroy.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of July, in the night, a woman disguised as a man is\r\narrested in the court of the Hôtel-de-Ville, and so maltreated that she\r\nfaints away; Bailly, in order to save her, is obliged to feign anger\r\nagainst her and have her sent immediately to prison. From the 14th to\r\nthe 22nd of July, Lafayette, at the risk of his life, saves with his\r\nown hand seventeen persons in different quarters.[1251]--On the 22nd of\r\nJuly, upon the denunciations which multiply around Paris like trains\r\nof gunpowder, two administrators of high rank, M. Foulon, Councillor\r\nof State, and M. Berthier, his son-in-law, are arrested, one near\r\nFontainebleau, and the other near Compiègne. M. Foulon, a strict\r\nmaster,[1252] but intelligent and useful, expended sixty thousand francs\r\nthe previous winter on his estate in giving employment to the poor. M.\r\nBerthier, an industrious and capable man, had officially surveyed\r\nand valued Ile-de-France, to equalize the taxes, and had reduced the\r\novercharged quotas first one-eighth and then a quarter. But both of\r\nthese gentlemen have arranged the details of the camp against which\r\nParis has risen; both are publicly proscribed for eight days previously\r\nby the Palais-Royal, and, with a people frightened by disorder,\r\nexasperated by hunger, and stupefied by suspicion, an accused person is\r\na guilty one.--With regard to Foulon, as with Réveillon, a story is made\r\nup, coined in the same mint, a sort of currency for popular circulation,\r\nand which the people itself manufactures by casting into one tragic\r\nexpression the sum of its sufferings and rankling memories:[1253] \"He\r\nsaid that we were worth no more than his horses; and that if we had no\r\nbread we had only to eat grass.\"--The old man of seventy-four is brought\r\nto Paris, with a truss of hay on his head, a collar of thistles around\r\nhis neck, and his mouth stuffed with hay. In vain does the electoral\r\nbureau order his imprisonment that he may be saved; the crowd yells out:\r\n\"Sentenced and hung!\" and, authoritatively, appoints the judges. In\r\nvain does Lafayette insist and entreat three times that the judgment be\r\nregularly rendered, and that the accused be sent to the Abbaye. A new\r\nwave of people comes up, and one man, \"well dressed,\" cries out: \"What\r\nis the need of a sentence for a man who has been condemned for thirty\r\nyears?\" Foulon is carried off; dragged across the square, and hung\r\nto the lamp post. The cord breaks twice, and twice he falls upon the\r\npavement. Re-hung with a fresh cord and then cut down, his head is\r\nsevered from his body and placed on the end of a pike.[1254] Meanwhile,\r\nBerthier, sent away from Compiègne by the municipality, afraid to\r\nkeep him in his prison where he was constantly menaced, arrives in a\r\ncabriolet under escort. The people carry placards around him filled with\r\nopprobrious epithets; in changing horses they threw hard black bread\r\ninto the carriage, exclaiming, \"There, wretch, see the bread you made us\r\neat!\" On reaching the church of Saint-Merry, a fearful storm of insults\r\nburst forth against him. He is called a monopolist, \"although he had\r\nnever bought or sold a grain of wheat.\" In the eyes of the multitude,\r\nwho has to explain the evil as caused by some evil-doer, he is the\r\nauthor of the famine. Conducted to the Abbaye, his escort is dispersed\r\nand he is pushed over to the lamp post. Then, seeing that all is lost,\r\nhe snatches a gun from one of his murderers and bravely defends himself.\r\nA soldier of the \"Royal Croats\" gives him a cut with his saber across\r\nthe stomach, and another tears out his heart. As the cook, who had cut\r\noff the head of M. de Launay, happens to be on the spot, they hand him\r\nthe heart to carry while the soldiers take the head, and both go to\r\nthe Hôtel-de-Ville to show their trophies to M. de Lafayette. On their\r\nreturn to the Palais-Royal, and while they are seated at table in a\r\ntavern, the people demand these two remains. They throw them out of the\r\nwindow and finish their supper, whilst the heart is marched about below\r\nin a bouquet of white carnations.--Such are the spectacles which this\r\ngarden presents where, a year before, \"good society in full dress\" came\r\non leaving the Opera to chat, often until two o'clock in the morning,\r\nunder the mild light of the moon, listening now to the violin of\r\nSaint-Georges, and now to the charming voice of Garat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--Paris in the hands of the people.\r\n\r\nHenceforth it is clear that no one is safe: neither the new militia nor\r\nthe new authorities suffice to enforce respect for the law. \"They did\r\nnot dare,\" says Bailly,[1255] \"oppose the people who, eight days before\r\nthis, had taken the Bastille.\"--In vain, after the last two murders, do\r\nBailly and Lafayette indignantly threaten to withdraw; they are forced\r\nto remain; their protection, such as it is, is all that is left, and, if\r\nthe National Guard is unable to prevent every murder, it prevents some\r\nof them. People live as they can under the constant expectation of fresh\r\npopular violence. \"To every impartial man,\" says Malouet, \"the Terror\r\ndates from the 14th of July\".--On the 17th, before setting out for\r\nParis, the King attends communion and makes his will in anticipation\r\nof assassination. From the 16th to the 18th, twenty personages of high\r\nrank, among others most of those on whose heads a price is set by the\r\nPalais-Royal, leave France: The Count d'Artois, Marshal de Broglie, the\r\nPrinces de Condé, de Conti, de Lambesc, de Vaudemont, the Countess\r\nde Polignac, and the Duchesses de Polignac and de Guiche.--The day\r\nfollowing the two murders, M. de Crosne, M. Doumer, M. Sureau, the most\r\nzealous and most valuable members of the committee on subsistence, all\r\nthose appointed to make purchases and to take care of the storehouses,\r\nconceal themselves or fly. On the eve of the two murders, the notaries\r\nof Paris, being menaced with a riot, had to advance 45,000 francs which\r\nwere promised to the workmen of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine; while the\r\npublic treasury, almost empty, is drained of 30,000 livres per day to\r\ndiminish the cost of bread.--Persons and possessions, great and small,\r\nprivate individuals and public functionaries, the Government itself,\r\nall is in the hands of the mob. \"From this moment,\" says a deputy,[1256]\r\n\"liberty did not exist even in the National Assembly. . . France stood\r\ndumb before thirty factious persons. The Assembly became in their hands\r\na passive instrument, which they forced to serve them in the execution\r\nof their projects.\"--They themselves do not lead, although they seem to\r\nlead. The great brute, which has taken the bit in its mouth, holds on to\r\nit, and it's plunging becomes more violent. Not only do both spurs which\r\nmaddened it, I mean the desire for innovation and the daily scarcity\r\nof food, continue to prick it on. But also the political hornets which,\r\nincreasing by thousands, buzz around its ears. And the license in which\r\nit revels for the first time, joined to the applause lavished upon it,\r\nurges it forward more violently each day. The insurrection is glorified.\r\nNot one of the assassins is sought out. It is against the conspiracy of\r\nMinisters that the Assembly institutes an inquiry. Rewards are bestowed\r\nupon the conquerors of the Bastille; it is declared that they have saved\r\nFrance. All honors are awarded to the people-to their good sense, their\r\nmagnanimity, and their justice. Adoration is paid to this new sovereign:\r\nhe is publicly and officially told, in the Assembly and by the press,\r\nthat he possesses every virtue, all rights and all powers. If he spills\r\nblood it is inadvertently, on provocation, and always with an infallible\r\ninstinct. Moreover, says a deputy, \"this blood, was it so pure?\" The\r\ngreater number of people prefers the theories of their books to the\r\nexperience of their eyes; they persist in the idyll, which they have\r\nfashioned for themselves. At the worst their dream, driven out from the\r\npresent, takes refuge in the future. To-morrow, when the Constitution is\r\ncomplete, the people, made happy, will again become wise: let us endure\r\nthe storm, which leads us on to so noble a harbor.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, beyond the King, inert and disarmed, beyond the Assembly,\r\ndisobeyed or submissive, appears the real monarch, the people--that is\r\nto say, a crowd of a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand individuals\r\ngathered together at random, on an impulse, on an alarm, suddenly and\r\nirresistibly made legislators, judges, and executioners. A formidable\r\npower, undefined and destructive, on which no one has any hold, and\r\nwhich, with its mother, howling and misshapen Liberty, sits at the\r\nthreshold of the Revolution like Milton's two specters at the gates of\r\nHell.\r\n\r\n     . . . Before the gates there sat\r\n     On either side a formidable shape;\r\n     The one seem'd woman to the waist, and fair,\r\n     but ended foul in many a scaly fold\r\n     Voluminous and vast, a serpent arm'd\r\n     With mortal sting: about her middle round\r\n     A cry of hell hounds never ceasing bark'd\r\n     With wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung\r\n     A hideous peal: yet, when they list, would creep,\r\n     If aught disturb'd their noise, into her womb,\r\n     And kennel there; yet there still bark'd and howl'd\r\n     Within unseen. . .\r\n     ........the other shape,\r\n     If shape it might be call'd, that shape had none\r\n     Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb,\r\n     Or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd\r\n     For each seem'd either: black it stood as night,\r\n     Fierce as ten furies, terrible as hell,\r\n     And shook a dreadful dart; what seem'd his head\r\n     The likeness of a kingly crown had on.\r\n\r\n     The monster moving onward came as fast,\r\n     With horrid strides; hell trembled as he strode.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1201: \"Archives Nationales,\" H. 1453.

For, it is owing\r\nto government that human wills form a harmony instead of chaos.\r\nIt serves society as the brain serves a living being. Incapable,\r\ninconsiderate, extravagant, engrossing, it often abuses its position,\r\noverstraining or misleading the body for which it should care, and which\r\nit should direct. But, taking all things into account, whatever it may\r\ndo, more good than harm is done, for through it the body stands erect,\r\nmarches on and guides its steps. Without it there is no organized\r\ndeliberate action, serviceable to the whole body. In it alone do we find\r\nthe comprehensive views, knowledge of the members of which it consists\r\nand of their aims, an idea of outward relationships, full and accurate\r\ninformation, in short, the superior intelligence which conceives what is\r\nbest for the common interests, and adapts means to ends. If it falters\r\nand is no longer obeyed, if it is forced and pushed from without by a\r\nviolent pressure, it ceases to control public affairs, and the social\r\norganization retrogrades by many steps. Through the dissolution of\r\nsociety, and the isolation of individuals, each man returns to his\r\noriginal feeble state, while power is vested in passing aggregates that\r\nlike whirlwinds spring up from the human dust.--One may divine how this\r\npower, which the most competent find it difficult to apply properly, is\r\nexercised by bands of men springing out of nowhere. It is a matter of\r\nsupplies, of their possessions, price and distribution. It is a matter\r\nof taxes, its proportion, apportionment and collection; of private\r\nproperty, its varieties, rights, and limitations It is a problem of\r\npublic authority, its allocation and its limits; of all those delicate\r\ncogwheels which, working into each other, constitute the great economic,\r\nsocial, and political machine. Each band in its own canton lays its\r\nrude hands on the wheels within its reach. They wrench or break them\r\nhaphazardly, under the impulse of the moment, heedless and indifferent\r\nto consequences, even when the reaction of to-morrow crushes them in the\r\nruin that they cause to day. Thus do unchained Negroes, each pulling and\r\nhauling his own way, undertake to manage a ship of which they have just\r\nobtained mastery.--In such a state of things white men are hardly worth\r\nmore than black ones. For, not only is the band, whose aim is violence,\r\ncomposed of those who are most destitute, most wildly enthusiastic, and\r\nmost inclined to destructiveness and to license. But also, as this band\r\ntumultuously carries out its violent action, each individual the most\r\nbrutal, the most irrational, and most corrupt, descends lower than\r\nhimself, even to the darkness, the madness, and the savagery of the\r\ndregs of society. In fact, a man who in the interchange of blows, would\r\nresist the excitement of murder, and not use his strength like a\r\nsavage, must be familiar with arms. He must be accustomed to danger, be\r\ncool-blooded, alive to the sentiment of honor, and above all, sensitive\r\nto that stern military code which, to the imagination of the soldier,\r\never holds out to him the provost's gibbet to which he is sure to rise,\r\nshould he strike one blow too many. Should all these restraints, inward\r\nas well as outward, be wanting, the man plunges into insurrection. He is\r\na novice in the acts of violence, which he carries out. He has no\r\nfear of the law, because he abolishes it. The action begun carries him\r\nfurther than he intended to go. Peril and resistance exasperate his\r\nanger. He catches the fever from contact with those who are fevered,\r\nand follows robbers who have become his comrades.[1301] Add to this\r\nthe clamors, the drunkenness, the spectacle of destruction, the nervous\r\ntremor of the body strained beyond its powers of endurance, and we\r\ncan comprehend how, from the peasant, the laborer, and the bourgeois,\r\npacified and tamed by an old civilization, we see all of a sudden spring\r\nforth the barbarian. Or still worse, the primitive animal, the grinning,\r\nsanguinary, wanton baboon, who giggles while he slays, and gambols over\r\nthe ruin he has accomplished. Such is the actual government to which\r\nFrance is given up, and after eighteen months' experience, the best\r\nqualified, most judicious and profoundest observer of the Revolution\r\nwill find nothing to compare it to but the invasion of the Roman Empire\r\nin the fourth century.[1302] \"The Huns, the Heruli, the Vandals, and the\r\nGoths will come neither from the north nor from the Black Sea; they are\r\nin our very midst.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--The provinces\r\n\r\n     Destruction of old Authorities.--Inadequacy of new\r\n     Authorities\r\n\r\nWhen in a building the principal beam gives way, cracks follow and\r\nmultiply, and the secondary joists fall in one by one for lack of the\r\nprop, which supported them. In a similar manner the authority of the\r\nKing being broken, all the powers, which he delegated, fall to the\r\nground.[1303] Intendants, parliaments, military commands, grand\r\nprovosts, administrative, judicial, and police functionaries in every\r\nprovince, and of every branch of the service, who maintain order and\r\nprotect property, taught by the murder of M. de Launey, the imprisonment\r\nof M. de Besenval, the flight of Marshal de Broglie, the assassinations\r\nof Foullon and Bertier, know what it costs should they try to perform\r\ntheir duties. Should it be forgotten local insurrections intervene, and\r\nkeep them in mind of it.\r\n\r\nThe officer in command in Burgundy is a prisoner at Dijon, with a\r\nguard at his door; and he is not allowed to speak with any one without\r\npermission, and without the presence of witnesses.[1304] The Commandant\r\nof Caen is besieged in the old palace and capitulates. The Commandant of\r\nBordeaux surrenders Château-Trompette with its guns and equipment. The\r\nCommandant at Metz, who remains firm, suffers the insults and the orders\r\nof the populace. The Commandant of Brittany wanders about his province\r\n\"like a vagabond,\" while at Rennes his people, furniture, and plate are\r\nkept as pledges. As soon as he sets foot in Normandy he is surrounded,\r\nand a sentinel is placed at his door.--The Intendant of Besançon takes\r\nto flight; that of Rouen sees his dwelling sacked from top to bottom,\r\nand escapes amid the shouts of a mob demanding his head.--At Rennes, the\r\nDean of the Parliament is arrested, maltreated, kept in his room with\r\na guard over him, and then, although ill, sent out of the town under an\r\nescort.--At Strasbourg \"thirty-six houses of magistrates are marked\r\nfor pillage.\"[1305]--At Besançon, the President of the Parliament is\r\nconstrained to let out of prison the insurgents arrested in a late\r\nout-break, and to publicly burn the whole of the papers belonging to\r\nthe prosecution.--In Alsace, since the beginning of the troubles, the\r\nprovosts were obliged to fly, the bailiffs and manorial judges hid\r\nthemselves, the forest-inspectors ran away, and the houses of the guards\r\nwere demolished. One man, sixty years of age, is outrageously beaten and\r\nmarched about the village, the people, meanwhile, pulling out his hair;\r\nnothing remains of his dwelling but the walls and a portion of the roof.\r\nAll his furniture and effects are broken up, burnt or stolen. He is\r\nforced to sign, along with his wife, an act by which he binds himself\r\nto refund all penalties inflicted by him, and to abandon all claims\r\nfor damages for the injuries to which he has just been subjected.--In\r\nFranche-Comté the authorities dare not condemn delinquents, and the\r\npolice do not arrest them; the military commandant writes that \"crimes\r\nof every kind are on the increase, and that he has no means of punishing\r\nthem.\" Insubordination is permanent in all the provinces; one of the\r\nprovincial commissions states with sadness:\r\n\r\n\"When all powers are in confusion and annihilated, when public force\r\nno longer exists, when all ties are sundered, when every individual\r\nconsiders himself relieved from all kinds of obligation, when public\r\nauthority no longer dares make itself felt, and it is a crime to have\r\nbeen clothed with it, what can be expected of our efforts to restore\r\norder?\"[1306]\r\n\r\nAll that remains of this great demolished State is forty thousand\r\ngroups of people, each separated and isolated, in towns and small market\r\nvillages where municipal bodies, elected committees, and improvised\r\nNational Guards strive to prevent the worst excesses.--But these local\r\nchiefs are novices; they are human, and they are timid. Chosen by\r\nacclamation they believe in popular rights; in the midst of riots they\r\nfeel themselves in danger. Hence, they generally obey the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"Rarely,\" says one of the provincial commissions reports, \"do the\r\nmunicipal authorities issue a summons; they allow the greatest excesses\r\nrather than enter upon prosecutions for which, sooner or later, they\r\nmay be held responsible by their fellow-citizens. . . . Municipal bodies\r\nhave no longer the power to resist anything.\"\r\n\r\nEspecially in the rural districts the mayor or syndic, who is a farmer,\r\nmakes it his first aim to make no enemies, and would resign his place\r\nif it were to bring him any \"unpleasantness\" with it. His rule in\r\nthe towns, and especially in large cities, is almost as lax and more\r\nprecarious, because explosive material is accumulated here to a much\r\nlarger extent, and the municipal officers, in their arm-chairs at the\r\ntown-hall, sit over a mine which may explode at any time. To-morrow,\r\nperhaps, some resolution passed at a tavern in the suburbs, or some\r\nincendiary newspaper just received from Paris, will furnish the\r\nspark.--No other defense against the populace is at hand than the\r\nsentimental proclamations of the National Assembly, the useless presence\r\nof troops who stand by and look on, and the uncertain help of a National\r\nGuard which will arrive too late. Occasionally these townspeople, who\r\nare now the rulers, utter a cry of distress from under the hands of\r\nthe sovereigns of the street who grasp them by the throat. At\r\nPuy-en-Velay,[1307] a town of twenty thousand inhabitants, the\r\nprésidial,[1308] the committee of twenty-four commissioners, a body of\r\ntwo hundred dragoons, and eight hundred men of the guard of burgesses,\r\nare \"paralyzed, and completely stupefied, by the vile populace. A\r\nmild treatment only increases its insubordination and insolence.\" This\r\npopulace proscribes whomsoever it pleases, and six days ago a gibbet,\r\nerected by its hands, has announced to the new magistrates the fate that\r\nawaits them.\r\n\r\n\" What will become of us this winter,\" they exclaim, \"in our\r\nimpoverished country, where bread is not to be had! We shall be the prey\r\nof wild beasts!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--Public feeling.--Famine\r\n\r\nThese people, in truth, are hungry, and, since the Revolution, their\r\nmisery has increased. Around Puy-en-Velay the country is laid waste,\r\nand the soil broken up by a terrible tempest, a fierce hailstorm, and\r\na deluge of rain. In the south, the crop proved to be moderate and even\r\ninsufficient.\r\n\r\n\"To trace a picture of the condition of Languedoc,\" writes the\r\nintendant,[1309] \"would be to give an account of calamities of every\r\ndescription. The panic which prevails in all communities, and which is\r\nstronger than all laws, stops traffic, and would cause famine even in\r\nthe midst of plenty. Commodities are enormously expensive, and there is\r\na lack of cash. Communities are ruined by the enormous outlays to which\r\nthey are exposed: The payment of the deputies to the seneschal's court,\r\nthe establishment of the burgess guards, guardhouses for this militia,\r\nand the purchase of arms, uniforms, and outlays in forming communes and\r\npermanent councils. To this must be add the cost of the printing of all\r\nkinds, and the publication of trivial deliberations. Further the loss\r\nof time due to disturbances occasioned by these circumstances, and\r\nthe utter stagnation of manufactures and of trade.\" All these causes\r\ncombined \"have reduced Languedoc to the last extremity.\"--In the Center,\r\nand in the North, where the crops are good, provisions are not less\r\nscarce, because wheat is not put in circulation, and is kept concealed.\r\n\r\n\"For five months,\" writes the municipal assembly of Louviers,[1310] \"not\r\na farmer has made his appearance in the markets of this town. Such a\r\ncircumstance was never known before, although, from time to time, high\r\nprices have prevailed to a considerable extent. On the contrary, the\r\nmarkets were always well supplied in proportion to the high price of\r\ngrain.\"\r\n\r\nIn vain the municipality orders the surrounding forty-seven parishes to\r\nprovide them with wheat. They pay no attention to the mandate; each for\r\nhimself and each for his own house; the intendant is no longer present\r\nto compel local interests to give way to public interests.\r\n\r\n\"In the wheat districts around us,\" says a letter from one of the\r\nBurgundy towns, \"we cannot rely on being able to make free purchases.\r\nSpecial regulations, supported by the civic guard, prevent grain from\r\nbeing sent out, and put a stop to its circulation. The adjacent markets\r\nare of no use to us. Not a sack of grain has been brought into our\r\nmarket for about eight months.\"\r\n\r\nAt Troyes, bread costs four sous per pound, at Bar-sur-Aube, and in the\r\nvicinity, four and a half sous per pound. The artisan who is out of work\r\nnow earns twelve sous a day at the relief works, and, on going into the\r\ncountry, he sees that the grain crop is good. What conclusion can he\r\ncome to but that the dearth is due to the monopolists, and that, if he\r\nshould die of hunger, it would be because those scoundrels have\r\nstarved him?--By virtue of this reasoning whoever has to do with these\r\nprovisions, whether proprietor, farmer, merchant or administrator, all\r\nare considered traitors. It is plain that there is a plot against\r\nthe people: the government, the Queen, the clergy, the nobles are all\r\nparties to it; and likewise the magistrates and the wealthy amongst the\r\nbourgeoisie and the rich. A rumor is current in the Ile-de-France that\r\nsacks of flour are thrown into the Seine, and that the cavalry horses\r\nare purposely made to eat unripe wheat in stalk. In Brittany, it is\r\nmaintained that grain is exported and stored up abroad. In Touraine, it\r\nis certain that this or that wholesale dealer allows it to sprout in his\r\ngranaries rather than sell it. At Troyes, a story prevails that another\r\nhas poisoned his flour with alum and arsenic, commissioned to do so\r\nby the bakers.--Conceive the effect of suspicions like these upon a\r\nsuffering multitude! A wave of hatred ascends from the empty stomach to\r\nthe morbid brain. The people are everywhere in quest of their imaginary\r\nenemies, plunging forward with closed eyes no matter on whom or on what,\r\nnot merely with all the weight of their mass, but with all the energy of\r\ntheir fury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--Panic.\r\n\r\n     General arming.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest of these weeks they were already alarmed. Accustomed\r\nto being led, the human herd is scared at being left to itself; it\r\nmisses its leaders who it has trodden under foot; in throwing off their\r\ntrammels it has deprived itself of their protection. It feels lonely,\r\nin an unknown country, exposed to dangers of which it is ignorant, and\r\nagainst which it is unable to guard itself. Now that the shepherds are\r\nslain or disarmed, suppose the wolves should unexpectedly appear!--And\r\nthere are wolves--I mean vagabonds and criminals--who have but just\r\nissued out of the darkness. They have robbed and burned, and are to be\r\nfound at every insurrection. Now that the police force no longer puts\r\nthem down, they show themselves instead of keeping themselves concealed.\r\nThey have only to lie in wait and come forth in a band, and both life\r\nand property will be at their mercy.--Deep anxiety, a vague feeling of\r\ndread, spreads through both town and country: towards the end of July\r\nthe panic, like a blinding, suffocating whirl of dusts, suddenly sweeps\r\nover hundreds of leagues of territory. The brigands are coming! They are\r\nburning the crops! They are only six leagues off, and then only two--the\r\nrefugees who have run away from the disorder prove it.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of July, at Angoulême,[1311] the alarm bell is heard about\r\nthree o'clock in the afternoon; the drums beat to arms, and cannon are\r\nmounted on the ramparts. The town has to be put in a state of defense\r\nagainst 15,000 bandits who are approaching, and from the walls a cloud\r\nof dust on the road is discovered with terror. It proves to be the\r\npost-wagon on its way to Bordeaux. After this the number of brigands\r\nis reduced to 1,500, but there is no doubt that they are ravaging the\r\ncountry. At nine o'clock in the evening 20,000 men are under arms, and\r\nthus they pass the night, always listening without hearing anything.\r\nTowards three o'clock in the morning there is another alarm, the church\r\nbells ringing and the people forming a battle array. They are convinced\r\nthat the brigands have burned Ruffec, Vernenil, La Rochefoucauld, and\r\nother places. The next day countrymen flock in to give their aid against\r\nbandits who are still absent. \"At nine o'clock,\" says a witness, \"we had\r\n40,000 men in the town, to whom we showed our gratitude.\" As the bandits\r\ndo not show themselves, it must be because they are concealed; a hundred\r\nhorsemen, a large number of men on foot, start out to search the forest\r\nof Braçonne, and to their great surprise they find nothing. But the\r\nterror is not allayed; \"during the following days a guard is kept\r\nmounted, and companies are enrolled among the townsmen,\" while Bordeaux,\r\nduly informed, dispatches a courier to offer the support of 20,000 men\r\nand even 30,000. \"What is surprising,\" adds the narrator, is that at ten\r\nleagues off in the neighborhood, in each parish, a similar disturbance\r\ntook place, and at about the same hour.\"--All that is required is that a\r\ngirl, returning to the village at night, should meet two men who do\r\nnot belong to the neighborhood. The case is the same in Auvergne. Whole\r\nparishes, on the strength of this, betake themselves at night to the\r\nwoods, abandoning their houses, and carrying away their furniture; \"the\r\nfugitives trod down and destroyed their own crops; pregnant women were\r\ninjured in the forests, and others lost their wits.\" Fear lends them\r\nwings. Two years after this, Madame Campan was shown a rocky peak on\r\nwhich a woman had taken refuge, and from which she was obliged to be let\r\ndown with ropes.--The people at last return to their homes, and resume\r\ntheir usual routines. But such large masses are not unsettled with\r\nimpunity; a tumult like this is, in itself, a lively source of alarm. As\r\nthe country did rise, it must have been on account of threatened danger\r\nand if the peril was not due to brigands, it must have come from some\r\nother quarter. Arthur Young, at Dijon and in Alsace,[1312] hears at the\r\npublic dinner tables that the Queen had formed a plot to undermine the\r\nNational Assembly and to massacre all Paris. Later on he is arrested in\r\na village near Clermont, and examined because he is evidently conspiring\r\nwith the Queen and the Comte d'Entraigues to blow up the town and send\r\nthe survivors to the galleys.\r\n\r\nNo argument, no experience has any effect against the multiplying\r\nphantoms of an over-excited imagination. Henceforth every commune, and\r\nevery man, provide themselves with arms and keep them ready for use. The\r\npeasant searches his hoard, and \"finds from ten to twelve francs for\r\nthe purchase of a gun.\" \"A national militia is found in the poorest\r\nvillage.\" Burgess guards and companies of volunteers patrol all the\r\ntowns. Military commanders deliver arms, ammunition, and equipment,\r\non the requisition of municipal bodies, while, in case of refusal,\r\nthe arsenals are pillaged, and, voluntarily or by force, four\r\nhundred thousand guns thus pass into the hands of the people in six\r\nmonths.[1313] Not content with this they must have cannon. Brest\r\nhaving demanded two, every town in Brittany does the same thing;\r\ntheir self-esteem is at stake as well as a need of feeling themselves\r\nstrong.--They lack nothing now to render themselves masters. All\r\nauthority, all force, every means of constraint and of intimidation\r\nis in their hands, and in theirs alone; and these sovereign hands have\r\nnothing to guide them in this actual interregnum of all legal powers,\r\nbut the wild or murderous suggestions of hunger or distrust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--Attacks on public individuals and public property.\r\n\r\n     At Strasbourg.--At Cherbourg.--At Mauberge.--At Rouen.--At\r\n     Besançon.--At Troyes.\r\n\r\nIt would take too much space to recount all the violent acts which were\r\ncommitted,--convoys arrested, grain pillaged, millers and corn merchants\r\nhung, decapitated, slaughtered, farmers called upon under the threats of\r\ndeath to give up even the seed reserved for sowing, proprietors ransomed\r\nand houses sacked.[1314] These outrages, unpunished, tolerated and even\r\nexcused or badly suppressed, are constantly repeated, and are, at first,\r\ndirected against public men and public property. As is commonly the\r\ncase, the rabble head the march and stamp the character of the whole\r\ninsurrection.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of July, at Strasbourg, on the news of Necker's return to\r\noffice, it interprets after its own fashion the public joy, which\r\nit witnesses. Five or six hundred beggars,[1315] their numbers soon\r\nincreased by the petty tradesmen, rush to the town hall, the magistrates\r\nonly having time to fly through a back door. The soldiers, on their\r\npart, with arms in their hands, allow all these things to go on, while\r\nseveral of them spur the assailants on. The windows are dashed to pieces\r\nunder a hailstorm of stones, the doors are forced with iron crowbars,\r\nand the populace enter amid a burst of acclamations from the spectators.\r\nImmediately, through every opening in the building, which has a facade\r\nfrontage of eighty feet, \"there is a shower of shutters, sashes,\r\nchairs, tables, sofas, books and papers, and then another of tiles,\r\nboards, balconies and fragments of wood-work.\" The public archives are\r\nthrown to the wind, and the surrounding streets are strewed with them;\r\nthe letters of enfranchisement, the charters of privileges, all the\r\nauthentic acts which, since Louis XIV, have guaranteed the liberties of\r\nthe town, perish in the flames. Some of the rabble in the cellars stave\r\nin casks of precious wine; fifteen thousand measures of it are lost,\r\nmaking a pool five feet deep in which several are drowned. Others,\r\nloaded with booty, go away under the eyes of the soldiers without\r\nbeing arrested. The havoc continues for three days; a number of houses\r\nbelonging to some of the magistrates \"are sacked from garret to cellar.\"\r\nWhen the honest citizens at last obtain arms and restore order, they are\r\ncontent with the hanging of one of the robbers; although, in order to\r\nplease the people, the magistrates are changed and the price of bread\r\nand meat is reduced.--It is not surprising that after such tactics, and\r\nwith such rewards, the riot should spread through the neighborhood far\r\nand near: in fact, starting from Strasbourg it overruns Alsace, while in\r\nthe country as in the city, there are always drunkards and rascals found\r\nto head it.\r\n\r\nNo matter where, be it in the East, in the West, or in the North, the\r\ninstigators are always of this stamp. At Cherbourg, on the 21st of\r\nJuly,[1316] the two leaders of the riot are \"highway robbers,\" who place\r\nthemselves at the head of women of the suburbs, foreign sailors, the\r\npopulace of the harbor, and it includes soldiers in workmen's smocks.\r\nThey force the delivery of the keys of the grain warehouses, and\r\nwreck the dwellings of the three richest merchants, also that of M. de\r\nGarantot, the sub-delegate: \"All records and papers are burnt; at M. de\r\nGarantot's alone the loss is estimated at more than 100,000 crowns at\r\nleast.\"--The same instinct of destruction prevails everywhere, a sort\r\nof envious fury against all who possess, command, or enjoy anything.\r\nAt Maubeuge, on the 27th of July, at the very assembly of the\r\nrepresentatives of the commune,[1317] the rabble interferes directly in\r\nits usual fashion. A band of nail and gun-makers takes possession of the\r\ntown-hall, and obliges the mayor to reduce the price of bread. Almost\r\nimmediately after this another band follows uttering cries of death,\r\nand smashes the windows, while the garrison, which has been ordered out,\r\nquietly contemplates the damage done. Death to the mayor, to all rulers,\r\nand to all employees! The rioters force open the prisons, set the\r\nprisoners free, and attack the tax-offices. The octroi offices are\r\ndemolished from top to bottom: they pull down the harbor offices and\r\nthrow the scales and weights into the river. All the custom and\r\nexcise stores are carried off; and the officials are compelled to give\r\nacquaintances. The houses of the registrar and of the sheriff, that of\r\nthe revenue comptroller, two hundred yards outside the town, are sacked;\r\nthe doors and the windows are smashed, the furniture and linen is torn\r\nto shreds, and the plate and jewelry is thrown into the wells. The same\r\nhavoc is committed in the mayor's town-house, also in his country-house\r\na league off. \"Not a window, not a door, not one article or eatable,\"\r\nis preserved; their work, moreover, is conscientiously done, without\r\nstopping a moment, \"from ten in the evening up to ten in the morning on\r\nthe following day.\" In addition to this the mayor, who has served\r\nfor thirty-four years, resigns his office at the solicitation of the\r\nwell-disposed but terrified people, and leaves the country.--At\r\nRouen, after the 24th of July,[1318] a written placard shows, by its\r\northography and its style, what sort of intellects composed it and what\r\nkind of actions are to follow it:\r\n\r\n\"Nation, you have here four heads to strike off, those of Pontcarry\r\n(the first president), Maussion (the intendant), Godard de Belboeuf (the\r\nattorney-general), and Durand (the attorney of the King in the town).\r\nWithout this we are lost, and if you do not do it, people will take you\r\nfor a heartless nation.\"\r\n\r\nNothing could be more explicit. The municipal body, however, to whom\r\nthe Parliament denounces this list of proscriptions, replies, with its\r\nforced optimism, that\r\n\r\n\"no citizen should consider himself or be considered as proscribed; he\r\nmay and must believe himself to be safe in his own dwelling, satisfied\r\nthat there is not a person in the city who would not fly to his rescue.\"\r\n\r\nThis is equal to telling the populace that it is free to do as it\r\npleases. On the strength of this the leaders of the riot work on in\r\nsecurity for ten days. One of them is a man named Jourdain, a lawyer of\r\nLisieux, and, like most of his brethren, a demagogue in principles; the\r\nother is a strolling actor from Paris named Bordier, famous in the part\r\nof harlequin,[1319] a bully in a house of ill-fame, \"a night-rover\r\nand drunkard, and who, fearing neither God nor devil,\" has taken up\r\npatriotism, and comes down into the provinces to play tragedy, and that,\r\ntragedy in real life. The fifth act begins on the night of the 3rd of\r\nAugust, with Bordier and Jourdain as the principal actors, and behind\r\nthem the rabble along with several companies of fresh volunteers. A\r\nshout is heard, \"Death to the monopolists! death to Maussion! we must\r\nhave his head!\" They pillage his hotel: many of them become intoxicated\r\nand fall asleep in his cellar. The revenue offices, the toll-gates of\r\nthe town, the excise office, all buildings in which the royal revenue is\r\ncollected, are wrecked. Immense bonfires are lighted in the streets and\r\non the old market square; furniture, clothes, papers, kitchen utensils,\r\nare all thrown in pell-mell, while carriages are dragged out and tumbled\r\ninto the Seine. It is only when the town-hall is attacked that the\r\nNational Guard, beginning to be alarmed, makes up its mind to seize\r\nBordier and some others. The following morning, however, at the shout of\r\nCarabo, and led by Jourdain, the prison is forced, Bordier set free, and\r\nthe intendant's residence, with its offices, is sacked a second time.\r\nWhen, finally, the two rascals are taken and led to the scaffold, the\r\npopulace is so strongly in their favor as to require the pointing of\r\nloaded cannon on them to keep them down.--At Besançon,[1320] on the 13th\r\nof August, the leaders consist of the servant of an exhibitor of\r\nwild animals, two goal-birds of whom one has already been branded in\r\nconsequence of a riot, and a number of \"inhabitants of ill-repute,\" who,\r\ntowards evening, spread through the town along with the soldiers. The\r\ngunners insult the officers they meet, seize them by the throat and want\r\nto throw them into the Doubs. Others go to the house of the commandant,\r\nM. de Langeron, and demand money of him; on his refusing to give it\r\nthey tear off their cockades and exclaim, \"We too belong to the\r\nThird-Estate!\" in other words, that they are the masters: subsequently\r\nthey demand the head of the intendant, M. de Caumartin, forcibly enter\r\nhis dwelling and break up his furniture. On the following day the rabble\r\nand the soldiers enter the coffee-houses, the convents, and the inns,\r\nand demand to be served with wine and eatables as much as they want, and\r\nthen, heated by drink, they burn the excise offices, force open several\r\nprisons, and set free all the smugglers and deserters. To put an end to\r\nthis saturnalia a grand banquet in the open air is suggested, in which\r\nthe National Guard is to fraternize with the whole garrison; but the\r\nbanquet turns into a drinking-bout, entire companies remaining under the\r\ntables dead drunk; other companies carry away with them four hogsheads\r\nof wine, and the rest, finding themselves left in the lurch, are\r\nscattered abroad outside the walls in order to rob the cellars of the\r\nneighboring villages. The next day, encouraged by the example set them,\r\na portion of the garrison, accompanied by a number of workmen, repeat\r\nthe expedition in the country. Finally, after four days of this orgy, to\r\nprevent Besançon and its outskirts from being indefinitely treated as a\r\nconquered country, the burgess guard, in alliance with the soldiers who\r\nhave remained loyal, rebel against the rebellion, go in quest of\r\nthe marauders and hang two of them that same evening.--Such is\r\nrioting![1321] an irruption of brute force which, turned loose on the\r\nhabitations of men, can do nothing but gorge itself, waste, break,\r\ndestroy, and do damage to itself; and if we follow the details of local\r\nhistory, we see how, in these days, similar outbreaks of violence might\r\nbe expected at any time.\r\n\r\nAt Troyes,[1322] on the 18th of July, a market-day, the peasants refuse\r\nto pay the entrance duties; the octroi having been suppressed at Paris,\r\nit ought also to be suppressed at Troyes. The populace, excited by this\r\nfirst disorderly act, gather into a mob for the purpose of dividing the\r\ngrain and arms amongst themselves, and the next day the town-hall is\r\ninvested by seven or eight thousand men, armed with clubs and stones.\r\nThe day after, a band, recruited in the surrounding villages, armed\r\nwith flails, shovels, and pitch-forks, enters under the leadership of\r\na joiner who marches at the head of it with a drawn saber; fortunately,\r\n\"all the honest folks among the burgesses \"immediately form themselves\r\ninto a National Guard, and this first attempt at a Jacquerie is put\r\ndown. But the agitation continues, and false rumors constantly keep\r\nit up.--On the 29th of July, on the report being circulated that five\r\nhundred \"brigands\" had left Paris and were coming to ravage the country,\r\nthe alarm bell sounds in the villages, and the peasants go forth armed.\r\nHenceforth, a vague idea of some impending danger fills all minds; the\r\nnecessity of defense and of guarding against enemies is maintained.\r\nThe new demagogues avail themselves of this to keep their hold on the\r\npeople, and when the time comes, to use it against their chiefs.--It is\r\nof no use to assure the people that the latter are patriots; that the\r\nrecently welcomed Necker with enthusiastic shouts; that the priests, the\r\nmonks, and canons were the first to adopt the national cockade; that\r\nthe nobles of the city and its environs are the most liberal in France;\r\nthat, on the 20th of July, the burgess guard saved the town; that\r\nall the wealthy give to the national workshops; that Mayor Huez, \"a\r\nvenerable and honest magistrate,\" is a benefactor to the poor and to\r\nthe public. All the old leaders are objects of distrust.--On the 8th\r\nof August, a mob demands the dismissal of the dragoons, arms for\r\nall volunteers, bread at two sous the pound, and the freedom of all\r\nprisoners. On the 19th of August the National Guard rejects its old\r\nofficers as aristocrats, and elects new ones. On the 27th of August, the\r\ncrowd invade the town-hall and distribute the arms amongst themselves.\r\nOn the 5th of September, two hundred men, led by Truelle, president of\r\nthe new committee, force the salt depot and have salt delivered to them\r\nat six sous per pound.--Meanwhile, in the lowest quarters of the city,\r\na story is concocted to the effect that if wheat is scarce it is\r\nbecause Huez, the mayor, and M. de St. Georges, the old commandant, are\r\nmonopolists, and now they say of Huez what they said five weeks before\r\nof Foulon, that \"he wants to make the people eat hay.\" The many-headed\r\nbrute growls fiercely and is about to spring. As usual, instead of\r\nrestraining him, they try to manage him.\r\n\r\n\"You must put your authority aside for a moment,\" writes the deputy of\r\nTroyes to the sheriffs,\" and act towards the people as to a friend; be\r\nas gentle with them as you would be with your equals, and rest assured\r\nthat they are capable of responding to it.\"\r\n\r\nThus does Huez act, and he even does more, paying no attention to their\r\nmenaces, refusing to provide for his own safety and almost offering\r\nhimself as a sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\"I have wronged no one,\" he exclaimed; \"why should any one bear me\r\nill-will?\"\r\n\r\nHis sole precaution is to provide something for the unfortunate poor\r\nwhen he is gone: he bequeaths in his will 18,000 livres to the poor,\r\nand, on the eve of his death, sends 100 crowns to the bureau of charity.\r\nBut what avail self-abnegation and beneficence against blind, insane\r\nrage! On the 9th of September, three loads of flour proving to be\r\nunsound, the people collect and shout out,\r\n\r\n\"Down with the flour-dealers! Down with machinery! Down with the mayor!\r\nDeath to the mayor, and let Truelle be put in his place!\"\r\n\r\nHuez, on leaving his court-room, is knocked down, murdered by kicks and\r\nblows, throttled, dragged to the reception hall, struck on his head\r\nwith a wooden-shoe and pitched down the grand staircase. The municipal\r\nofficers strive in vain to protect him; a rope is put around his neck\r\nand they begin to drag him along. A priest, who begs to be allowed at\r\nleast to save his soul, is repulsed and beaten. A woman jumps on\r\nthe prostrate old man, stamps on his face and repeatedly thrusts her\r\nscissors in his eyes. He is dragged along with the rope around his neck\r\nup to the Pont de la Selle, and thrown into the neighboring ford, and\r\nthen drawn out, again dragged through the streets and in the gutters,\r\nwith a bunch of hay crammed in his mouth.[1323]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, his house as well as that of the lieutenant of police,\r\nthat of the notary Guyot, and that of M. de Saint-Georges, are sacked;\r\nthe pillaging and destruction lasts four hours; at the notary's house,\r\nsix hundred bottles of wine are consumed or carried off; objects of\r\nvalue are divided, and the rest, even down to the iron balcony, is\r\ndemolished or broken; the rioters cry out, on leaving, that they have\r\nstill to burn twenty-seven houses, and to take twenty-seven heads. \"No\r\none at Troyes went to bed that fatal night.\"--During the succeeding\r\ndays, for nearly two weeks, society seems to be dissolved. Placards\r\nposted about the streets proscribe municipal officers, canons, divines,\r\nprivileged persons, prominent merchants, and even ladies of charity; the\r\nlatter are so frightened that they throw up their office, while a number\r\nof persons move off into the country; others barricade themselves in\r\ntheir dwellings and only open their doors with saber in hand. Not\r\nuntil the 26th does the orderly class rally sufficiently to resume the\r\nascendancy and arrest the miscreants.--Such is public life in France\r\nafter the 14th of July: the magistrates in each town feel that they are\r\nat the mercy of a band of savages and sometimes of cannibals. Those of\r\nTroyes had just tortured Huez after the fashion of Hurons, while those\r\nof Caen did worse; Major de Belzance, not less innocent, and under sworn\r\nprotection,[1324] was cut to pieces like Laperouse in the Fiji Islands,\r\nand a woman ate his heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--Taxes are no longer paid.\r\n\r\n     Devastation of the Forests.--The new game laws.\r\n\r\nIt is, under such circumstances, possible to foretell whether taxes come\r\nin, and whether municipalities that sway about in every popular breeze\r\nwill have the authority to collect the odious revenues.--Towards the end\r\nof September,[1325] I find a list of thirty-six committees or municipal\r\nbodies which, within a radius of fifty leagues around Paris, refuse\r\nto ensure the collection of taxes. One of them tolerates the sale\r\nof contraband salt, in order not to excite a riot. Another takes the\r\nprecaution to disarm the employees in the excise department. In a\r\nthird the municipal officers were the first to provide themselves with\r\ncontraband salt and contraband tobacco.\r\n\r\nAt Peronne and at Ham, the order having come to restore the toll-houses,\r\nthe people destroy the soldiers' quarters, conduct all the employees\r\nto their homes, and order them to leave within twenty-four hours, under\r\npenalty of death. After twenty months' resistance Paris will end the\r\nmatter by forcing the National Assembly to give in and by obtaining the\r\nfinal suppression of its octroi.[1326]--Of all the creditors whose hand\r\neach one felt on his shoulders, that of the exchequer was the heaviest,\r\nand now it is the weakest; hence this is the first whose grasp is to\r\nbe shaken off; there is none which is more heartily detested or which\r\nreceives harsher treatment. Especially against collectors of the\r\nsalt-tax, custom-house officers, and excisemen the fury is universal.\r\nThese, everywhere,[1327] are in danger of their lives and are obliged to\r\nfly. At Falaise, in Normandy, the people threaten to \"cut to pieces\r\nthe director of the excise.\" At Baignes, in Saintonge, his house is\r\ndevastated and his papers and effects are burned; they put a knife to\r\nthe throat of his son, a child six years of age, saying, \"Thou must\r\nperish that there may be no more of thy race.\" For four hours the clerks\r\nare on the point of being torn to pieces; through the entreaties of the\r\nlord of the manor, who sees scythes and sabers aimed at his own\r\nhead, they are released only on the condition that they \"abjure\r\ntheir employment.\"--Again, for two months following the taking of\r\nthe Bastille, insurrections break out by hundreds, like a volley\r\nof musketry, against indirect taxation. From the 23rd of July the\r\nIntendant of Champagne reports that \"the uprising is general in almost\r\nall the towns under his command.\" On the following day the Intendant of\r\nAlençon writes that, in his province, \"the royal dues will no longer be\r\npaid anywhere.\" On the 7th of August, M. Necker states to the National\r\nAssembly that in the two intendants' districts of Caen and Alençon it\r\nhas been necessary to reduce the price of salt one-half; that \"in\r\nan infinity of places\" the collection of the excise is stopped or\r\nsuspended; that the smuggling of salt and tobacco is done by \"convoys\r\nand by open force\" in Picardy, in Lorraine, and in the Trois-Évêchés;\r\nthat the indirect tax does not come in, that the receivers-general and\r\nthe receivers of the taille are \"at bay\" and can no longer keep their\r\nengagements. The public income diminishes from month to month; in the\r\nsocial body, the heart, already so feeble, faints; deprived of the\r\nblood which no longer reaches it, it ceases to propel to the muscles the\r\nvivifying current which restores their waste and adds to their energy.\r\n\r\n\"All controlling power is slackened,\" says Necker, \"everything is a prey\r\nto the passions of individuals.\" Where is the power to constrain them\r\nand to secure to the State its dues?--The clergy, the nobles, wealthy\r\ntownsmen, and certain brave artisans and farmers, undoubtedly pay, and\r\neven sometimes give spontaneously. But in society those who possess\r\nintelligence, who are in easy circumstances and conscientious, form a\r\nsmall select class; the great mass is egotistic, ignorant, and needy,\r\nand lets its money go only under constraint; there is but one way to\r\ncollect the taxes, and that is to extort them. From time immemorial,\r\ndirect taxes in France have been collected only by bailiffs and\r\nseizures; which is not surprising, as they take away a full half of the\r\nnet income. Now that the peasants of each village are armed and form\r\na band, let the collector come and make seizures if he dare!--\"\r\nImmediately after the decree on the equality of the taxes,\" writes the\r\nprovincial commission of Alsace,[1328] \"the people generally refused\r\nto make any payments, until those who were exempt and privileged should\r\nhave been inscribed on the local lists.\" In many places the peasants\r\nthreaten to obtain the reimbursement of their installments, while in\r\nothers they insist that the decree should be retrospective and that the\r\nnew rate-payers should pay for the past year. \"No collector dare send an\r\nofficial to distrain; none that are sent dare fulfill their mission.\"--\"\r\nIt is not the good bourgeois\" of whom there is any fear, \"but the rabble\r\nwho make the latter and every one else afraid of them;\" resistance and\r\ndisorder everywhere come from \"people that have nothing to lose.\"--Not\r\nonly do they shake off taxation, but they usurp property, and declare\r\nthat, being the Nation, whatever belongs to the Nation belongs to\r\nthem. The forests of Alsace are laid waste, the seignorial as well as\r\ncommunal, and wantonly destroyed with the wastefulness of children or\r\nof maniacs. \"In many places, to avoid the trouble of removing the woods,\r\nthey are burnt, and the people content themselves with carrying off the\r\nashes.\"--After the decrees of August 4th, and in spite of the law which\r\nlicenses the proprietor only to hunt on his own grounds, the impulse\r\nto break the law becomes irresistible. Every man who can procure a gun\r\nbegins operations;[1329] the crops which are still standing are trodden\r\nunder foot, the lordly residences are invaded and the palings are\r\nscaled; the King himself at Versailles is wakened by shots fired in his\r\npark. Stags, fawns, deer, wild boars, hares, and rabbits, are slain by\r\nthousands, cooked with stolen wood, and eaten up on the spot. There is\r\na constant discharge of musketry throughout France for more than two\r\nmonths, and, as on an American prairie, every living animal belongs to\r\nhim who kills it. At Choiseul, in Champagne, not only are all the hares\r\nand partridges of the barony exterminated, but the ponds are exhausted\r\nof fish; the court of the chateau even is entered, to fire on the\r\npigeon-house and destroy the pigeons, and then the pigeons and fish, of\r\nwhich they have too many, are offered to the proprietor for sale--It\r\nis \"the patriots\" of the village with \"smugglers and bad characters\"\r\nbelonging to the neighborhood who make this expedition; they are seen\r\nin the front ranks of every act of violence, and it is not difficult\r\nto foresee that, under their leadership, attacks on public persons\r\nand public property will be followed by attacks on private persons and\r\nprivate property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--Attack upon private individuals and private property.\r\n\r\n     Aristocrats denounced to the people as their enemies.\r\n     --Effect of news from Paris.--Influence of the village\r\n     attorneys.--Isolated acts of violence.--A general rising of\r\n     the peasantry in the east.--War against the castles, feudal\r\n     estates, and property.--Preparations for other Jacqueries.\r\n\r\nIndeed, an outlawed class already exists, they are called \"aristocrats.\"\r\nThis deadly term, applied at first to the nobles and prelates in the\r\nStates-General who declined to take part in the reunion of the three\r\norders, is extended so as to embrace all whose titles, offices,\r\nalliances, and manner of living distinguish them from the multitude.\r\nThat which entitled them to respect is that which marks them out as\r\nobjects of ill-will; while the people, who, though suffering from their\r\nprivileges, did not regard them personally with hatred, are now taught\r\nto consider them as their enemies. Each, on his own estate, is\r\nheld accountable for the evil designs attributed to his brethren at\r\nVersailles, and, on the false report of a plot at the center, the\r\npeasants classify him as one of the conspirators.[1330] Thus does the\r\npeasant jacquerie commence, and the fanatics who have fanned the flame\r\nin Paris are to do the same in the provinces. \"You wish to know the\r\nauthors of the agitation,\" writes a sensible man to the committee\r\nof investigation; \"you will find them amongst the deputies of the\r\nThird-Estate,\" and especially among the attorneys and advocates. \"These\r\ndispatch incendiary letters to their constituents, which letters\r\nare received by municipal bodies alike composed of attorneys and of\r\nadvocates.... they are read aloud in the public squares, while copies of\r\nthem are distributed among all the villages. In these villages, if any\r\none knows how to read besides the priest and the lord of the manor, it\r\nis the legal practitioner,\" the born enemy of the lord of the manor,\r\nwhose place he covets, vain of his oratorical powers, embittered by\r\nhis power, and never failing to blacken everything.[1331] It is highly\r\nprobable that he is the one who composes and circulates the placards\r\ncalling on the people, in the King's name, to resort to violence.--At\r\nSecondigny, in Poitou, on the 23rd of July,[1332] the laborers in the\r\nforest receive a letter \"which summons them to attack all the country\r\ngentlemen round about, and to massacre without mercy all those who\r\nrefuse to renounce their privileges.... promising them that not only\r\nwill their crimes go unpunished, but that they will even be rewarded.\"\r\nM. Despretz-Montpezat, correspondent of the deputies of the nobles,\r\nis seized, and dragged with his son to the dwelling of the\r\nprocurator-fiscal, to force him to give his signature; the inhabitants\r\nare forbidden to render him assistance \"on pain of death and fire.\"\r\n\"Sign,\" they exclaim, \"or we will tear out your heart, and set fire to\r\nthis house!\" At this moment the neighboring notary, who is doubtless an\r\naccomplice, appears with a stamped paper, and says to him, \"Monsieur,\r\nI have just come from Niort, where the Third-Estate has done the same\r\nthing to all the gentlemen of the town; one, who refused, was cut to\r\npieces before our eyes.\"--\"We are compelled to sign renunciations of our\r\nprivileges, and give our assent to one and the same taxation, as if\r\nthe nobles had not already done so.\" The band gives notice that it will\r\nproceed in the same fashion with all the chateaux in the vicinity, and\r\nterror precedes or follows them. \"Nobody dares write,\" M. Despretz\r\nsends word; \"I attempt it at the risk of my life.\"--Nobles and prelates\r\nbecome objects of suspicion everywhere; village committees open their\r\nletters, and they have to suffer their houses to be searched.[1333] They\r\nare forced to adopt the new cockade: to be a gentleman, and not wear it,\r\nis to deserve hanging. At Mamers, in Maine, M. de Beauvoir refuses to\r\nwear it, and is at the point of being put into the pillory and felled.\r\nNear La F1èche, M. de Brissac is arrested, and a message is sent\r\nto Paris to know if he shall be taken there, \"or be beheaded in the\r\nmeantime.\" Two deputies of the nobles, MM. de Montesson and de Vassé who\r\nhad come to ask the consent of their constituents to their joining the\r\nThird-Estate, are recognized near Mans; their honorable scruples and\r\ntheir pledges to the constituents are considered of no importance, nor\r\neven the step that they are now taking to fulfill them; it suffices that\r\nthey voted against the Third-Estate at Versailles; the populace pursues\r\nthem and breaks up their carriages, and pillages their trunks.--Woe to\r\nthe nobles, especially if they have taken any part in local rule, and\r\nif they are opposed to popular panics! M. Cureau, deputy-mayor of\r\nMans,[1334] had issued orders during the famine, and, having retired to\r\nhis chateau of Nouay, had told the peasants that the announcement of\r\nthe coming of brigands was a false alarm; he thought that it was not\r\nnecessary to sound the alarm bell, and all that was necessary was that\r\nthey should remain quiet. Accordingly he is set down as being in league\r\nwith the brigands, and besides this he is a monopolist, and a buyer of\r\nstanding crops. The peasants lead him off; along with his son-in-law, M.\r\nde Montesson, to the neighboring village, where there are judges. On the\r\nway \"they dragged their victims on the ground, pummeled them, trampled\r\non them, spit in their faces, and besmeared them with filth.\" M. de\r\nMontesson is shot, while M. Cureau is killed by degrees; a carpenter\r\ncuts off the two heads with a double-edged ax, and children bear them\r\nalong to the sound of drums and violins. Meanwhile, the judges of the\r\nplace, brought by force, draw up an official report stating the finding\r\nof thirty louis and several bills of the Banque d'Escompte in the\r\npockets of M. de Cureau, on the discovery of which a shout of triumph is\r\nset up: this evidence proves that they were going to buy up the standing\r\nwheat!--Such is the course of popular justice. Now that the Third-Estate\r\nhas become the nation, every mob thinks that it has the right to\r\npronounce sentences, which it carries out, on lives and on possessions.\r\n\r\nThese explosions are isolated in the western, central and southern\r\nprovinces; the conflagration, however, is universal in the east. On a\r\nstrip of ground from thirty to fifty leagues broad, extending from\r\nthe extreme north down to Provence. Alsace, Franche-Comté, Burgundy,\r\nMâconnais, Beaujolais, Auvergne, Viennois, Dauphiny, the whole of this\r\nterritory resembles a continuous mine which explodes at the same time.\r\nThe first column of flame which shoots up is on the frontiers of Alsace\r\nand Franche-Comté, in the vicinity of Belfort and Vésoul, a feudal\r\ndistrict, in which the peasant, over-burdened with taxes, bears the\r\nheavier yoke with greater impatience. An instinctive argument is going\r\non in his mind without his knowing it. \"The good Assembly and the good\r\nKing want us to be happy, suppose we help them! They say that the King\r\nhas already relieved us of the taxes, suppose we relieve ourselves\r\nof paying rents! Down with the nobles! They are no better than the\r\ntax-collectors!\"--On the 16th of July, the chateau of Sancy, belonging\r\nto the Princesses de Beaufremont, is sacked, and on the 18th those of\r\nLure, Bithaine, and Molans.[1335] On the 29th, an accident which occurs\r\nwith some fire-works at a popular festival at the house of M. de Mesmay,\r\nleads the lower class to believe that the invitation extended to\r\nthem was a trap, and that there was a desire to get rid of them by\r\ntreachery.[1336] Seized with rage they set fire to the chateau, and\r\nduring the following week[1337] destroy three abbeys, ruin eleven\r\nchateaux and pillage others. \"All records are destroyed, the registers\r\nand court-rolls are carried off; and the deposits violated.\"--Starting\r\nfrom this spot, \"the hurricane of insurrection\" stretches over the\r\nwhole of Alsace from Huningue to Landau.[1338] The insurgents display\r\nplacards, signed Louis, stating that for a certain lapse of time they\r\nshall be permitted to exercise justice themselves, and, in Sundgau, a\r\nwell-dressed weaver, decorated with a blue belt, passes for a prince,\r\nthe King's second son. They begin by falling on the Jews, their\r\nhereditary leeches; they sack their dwellings, divide their money among\r\nthemselves, and hunt them down like so many fallow-deer. At Bâle alone,\r\nit is said that twelve hundred of these unfortunate fugitives arrived\r\nwith their families.--The distance between the Jew creditor and the\r\nChristian proprietor is not great, and this is soon cleared. Remiremont\r\nis only saved by a detachment of dragoons. Eight hundred men attack\r\nthe chateau of Uberbrünn. The abbey of Neubourg is taken by storm. At\r\nGuebwiller, on the 31st of July, five hundred peasants, subjects of the\r\nabbey of Murbach, make a descent on the abbot's palace and on the house\r\nof the canons. Cupboards, chests, beds, windows, mirrors, frames, even\r\nthe tiles of the roof and the hinges of the casements are hacked\r\nto pieces: \"They kindle fires on the beautiful inlaid floors of the\r\napartments, and there burn up the library and the title-deeds.\" The\r\nabbot's superb carriage is so broken up that not a wheel remains entire.\r\n\"Wine streams through the cellars. One cask of sixteen hundred measures\r\nis half lost; the plate and the linen are carried off.\"--Society is\r\nevidently being overthrown, while with the power, property is changing\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThese are their very words. In Franche-Comte[1339] the inhabitants of\r\neight communes come and declare to the Bernardins of Grâce-Dieu and of\r\nLieu-Croissant \"that, being of the Third-Estate, it is time now for the\r\npeople to rule over abbots and monks, considering that the domination\r\nof the latter has lasted too long,\" and thereupon they carry off all\r\nthe titles to property and to rentals belonging to the abbey in their\r\ncommune. In Upper Dauphiny, during the destruction of M. de Murat's\r\nchateau, a man named Ferréol struck the furniture with a big stick,\r\nexclaiming, \"Hey, so much for you, Murat; you have been master a good\r\nwhile, now it's our turn!\"[1340] Those who rifle houses, and steal like\r\nhighway robbers, think that they are defending a cause, and reply to\r\nthe challenge, \"Who goes there?\" \"We are for the brigand\r\nThird-Estate!\"--Everywhere the belief prevails that they are clothed\r\nwith authority, and they conduct themselves like a conquering horde\r\nunder the orders of an absent general. At Remiremont and at Luxeuil\r\nthey produce an edict, stating that \"all this brigandage, pillage, and\r\ndestruction\" is permitted. In Dauphiny, the leaders of the bands\r\nsay that they possess the King's orders. In Auvergne, \"they follow\r\nimperative orders, being advised that such is his Majesty's will.\"\r\nNowhere do we see that an insurgent village exercises personal vengeance\r\nagainst its lord. If the people fire on the nobles they encounter, it is\r\nnot through personal hatred. They are destroying the class, and do not\r\npursue individuals. They detest feudal privileges, holders of charters,\r\nthe cursed parchments by virtue of which they are made to pay, but not\r\nthe nobleman who, when he resides at home, is of humane intentions,\r\ncompassionate, and even often beneficent. At Luxeuil, the abbot, who\r\nis forced with uplifted ax to sign a relinquishment of his seignorial\r\nrights over twenty-three estates, has dwelt among them for forty-six\r\nyears, and has been wholly devoted to them.[1341] In the canton of\r\nCrémieu, \"where the havoc is immense,\" all the nobles, write the\r\nmunicipal officers, are \"patriots and benevolent.\" In Dauphiny, the\r\nengineers, magistrates, and prelates, whose chateaux are sacked, were\r\nthe first to espouse the cause of the people and of public liberties\r\nagainst the ministers. In Auvergne, the peasants themselves \"manifest a\r\ngood deal of repugnance to act in this way against such kind masters.\"\r\nBut it must be done; the only concession which can be made in\r\nconsideration of the kindness which had been extended to them is, not to\r\nburn the chateau of the ladies of Vanes, who had been so charitable; but\r\nthey burn all their title-deeds, and torture the business agent at three\r\ndifferent times by fire, to force him to deliver a document which\r\nhe does not possess; they then only withdraw him from the fire\r\nhalf-broiled, because the ladies, on their knees, implore mercy for\r\nhim. They are like the soldiers on a campaign who execute orders\r\nwith docility, for which necessity is the only plea, and who, without\r\nregarding themselves as brigands, commit acts of brigandage.\r\n\r\nBut here the situation is more tragic, for it is war in the midst of\r\npeace, a war of the brutal and barbaric multitude against the highly\r\ncultivated, well-disposed and confiding, who had not anticipated\r\nanything of the kind, who had not even dreamt of defending themselves,\r\nand who had no protection. The Comte de Courtivron, with his family,\r\nwas staying at the watering-place of Luxeuil with his uncle, the Abbé\r\nof Clermont-Tonnerre, an old man of seventy years. On the 19th of July,\r\nfifty peasants from Fougerolle break into and demolish everything in the\r\nhouses of an usher and a collector of the excise. Thereupon the mayor\r\nof the place intimates to the nobles and magistrates who are taking the\r\nwaters, that they had better leave the house in twenty-four hours, as\r\n\"he had been advised of an intention to burn the houses in which they\r\nwere staying,\" and he did not wish to have Luxeuil exposed to this\r\ndanger on account of their presence there. The following day, the guard,\r\nas obliging as the mayor, allows the band to enter the town and to force\r\nthe abbey: the usual events follow, renunciations are extorted, records\r\nand cellars are ransacked, plate and other effects are stolen. M. de\r\nCourtivron escaping with his uncle during the night, the alarm bell\r\nis sounded and they are pursued, and with difficulty obtain refuge\r\nin Plombières. The bourgeoisie of Plombières, however, for fear of\r\ncompromising themselves, oblige them to depart. On the road two hundred\r\ninsurgents threaten to kill their horses and to smash their carriage,\r\nand they only find safety at last at Porentruy, outside of France.\r\nOn his return, M. de Courtivron is shot at by the band which has just\r\npillaged the abbey of Lure, and they shout out at him as he passes,\r\n\"Let's massacre the nobles!\" Meanwhile, the chateau of Vauvilliers, to\r\nwhich his sick wife had been carried, is devastated from top to bottom;\r\nthe mob search for her everywhere, and she only escapes by hiding\r\nherself in a hay-loft. Both are anxious to fly into Burgundy, but word\r\nis sent them that at Dijon \"the nobles are blockaded by the people,\" and\r\nthat, in the country, they threaten to set their houses on fire.--There\r\nis no asylum to be had, either in their own homes nor in the homes of\r\nothers, nor in places along the roads, fugitives being stopped in all\r\nthe small villages and market-towns. In Dauphiny[1342] \"the Abbess of\r\nSt. Pierre de Lyon, one of the nuns, M. de Perrotin, M. de Bellegarde,\r\nthe Marquis de la Tour-du-Pin, and the Chevalier de Moidieu, are\r\narrested at Champier by the armed population, led to the Côte\r\nSaint-André, confined in the town-hall, whence they send to Grenoble\r\nfor assistance,\" and, to have them released, the Grenoble Committee is\r\nobliged to send commissioners. Their only refuge is in the large cities,\r\nwhere some semblance of a precarious order exists, and in the ranks of\r\nthe City Guards, which march from Lyons, Dijon, and Grenoble, to keep\r\nthe inundation down. Throughout the country scattered chateaux are\r\nswallowed up by the popular tide, and, as the feudal rights are often in\r\nplebeian hands, it insensibly rises beyond its first overflow.--There\r\nis no limit to an insurrection against property. This one extends from\r\nabbeys and chateaux to the \"houses of the bourgeoisie.\"[1343] The grudge\r\nat first was confined to the holders of charters; now it is extended to\r\nall who possess anything. Well-to-do farmers and priests abandon their\r\nparishes and fly to the towns. Travelers are put to ransom. Thieves,\r\nrobbers, and returned convicts, at the head of armed bands, seize\r\nwhatever they can lay their hands on. Cupidity becomes inflamed by such\r\nexamples; on domains which are deserted and in a state of confusion,\r\nwhere there is nothing to indicate a master's presence, all seems to\r\nlapse to the first comer. A small farmer of the neighborhood has carried\r\naway wine and returns the following day in search of hay. All the\r\nfurniture of a chateau in Dauphin is removed, even to the hinges of the\r\ndoors, by a large reinforcement of carts.--\" It is the war of the\r\npoor against the rich,\" says a deputy, \"and, on the 3rd of August, the\r\nCommittee on Reports declares to the National Assembly \"that no kind of\r\nproperty has been spared.\" In Franche-Comté, \"nearly forty chateaux and\r\nseignorial mansions have been pillaged or burnt.\"[1344] From Lancers\r\nto Gray about three out of five chateaux are sacked. In Dauphin\r\ntwenty-seven are burned or destroyed; five in the small district of\r\nViennese, and, besides these, all the monasteries--nine at least in\r\nAuvergne, seventy-two, it is said, in Mâconnais and Beaujolais, without\r\ncounting those of Alsace. On the 31st of July, Lally-Tollendal, on\r\nentering the tribune, has his hands full of letters of distress, with\r\na list of thirty-six chateaux burnt, demolished, or pillaged, in one\r\nprovince, and the details of still worse violence against persons:[1345]\r\n\r\n\"in Languedoc, M. de Barras, cut to pieces in the presence of his\r\nwife who is about to be confined, and who is dead in consequence; in\r\nNormandy, a paralytic gentleman left on a burning pile and taken off\r\nfrom it with his hands burnt; in Franche-Comté, Madame de Bathilly\r\ncompelled, with an ax over her head, to give up her title-deeds and even\r\nher estate; Madame de Listenay forced to do the same, with a pitchfork\r\nat her neck and her two daughters in a swoon at her feet; Comte de\r\nMontjustin, with his wife, having a pistol at his throat for three\r\nhours; and both dragged from their carriage to be thrown into a pond,\r\nwhere they are saved by a passing regiment of soldiers; Baron de\r\nMontjustin, one of the twenty-two popular noblemen, suspended for an\r\nhour in a well, listening to a discussion whether he shall be dropped\r\ndown or whether he should die in some other way; the Chevalier d'Ambly,\r\ntorn from his chateau and dragged naked into the village, placed on a\r\ndung-heap after having his eyebrows and all his hair pulled out, while\r\nthe crowd kept on dancing around him.\"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of a disintegrated society, under the semblance only of a\r\ngovernment, it is manifest that an invasion is under way, an invasion\r\nof barbarians which will complete by terror that which it has begun by\r\nviolence, and which, like the invasions of the Normans in the tenth and\r\neleventh centuries, ends in the conquest and dispossession of an entire\r\nclass. In vain the National Guard and the other troops that remain loyal\r\nsucceed in stemming the first torrent; in vain does the Assembly hollow\r\nout a bed for it and strive to bank it in by fixed boundaries. The\r\ndecrees of the 4th of August and the regulations which follow are but so\r\nmany spiders' webs stretched across a torrent. The peasants, moreover,\r\nputting their own interpretation on the decrees, convert the new laws\r\ninto authority for continuing in their course or beginning over again.\r\nNo more rents, however legitimate, however legal!\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday,\"[1346] writes a gentleman of Auvergne, we were notified\r\nthat the fruit-tithe (percières) would no longer be paid, and that the\r\nexample of other provinces was only being followed which no longer, even\r\nby royal order, pay tithes.\" In Franche-Comté \"numerous communities\r\nare satisfied that they no longer owe anything either to the King or to\r\ntheir lords. . . . The villages divide amongst themselves the fields and\r\nwoods belonging to the nobles.\"--\r\n\r\nIt must be noted that charter-holding and feudal titles are still intact\r\nin three-fourths of France, that it is the interest of the peasant to\r\nensure their disappearance, and that he is always armed. To secure a\r\nnew outbreak of jacqueries, it is only necessary that central control,\r\nalready thrown into disorder, should be withdrawn. This is the work of\r\nVersailles and of Paris; and there, at Paris as well as at Versailles,\r\nsome, through lack of foresight and infatuation, and others, through\r\nblindness and indecision--the latter through weakness and the former\r\nthrough violence--all are laboring to accomplish it.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1301: Dusaulx, 374. \"I remarked that if there were a few\r\namong the people at that time who dared commit crime, there were several\r\nwho wished it, and that every one endured it.\"--\" Archives Nationales,\"\r\nDXXIX, 3.

PARIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--Paris.\r\n\r\n     Powerlessness and discords of the authorities.--The people,\r\n     king.\r\n\r\nThe powerlessness, indeed, of the heads of the Government, and the\r\nlack of discipline among all its subordinates, are much greater in the\r\ncapital than in the provinces.--Paris possesses a mayor, Bailly; but\r\n\"from the first day, and in the easiest manner possible,\"[1401] his\r\nmunicipal council, that is to say, \"the assembly of the representatives\r\nof the commune, has accustomed itself to carry on the government alone,\r\noverlooking him entirely.\" There is a central administration, the\r\nmunicipal council, presided over by the mayor; but, \"at this time,\r\nauthority is everywhere except where the preponderating authority should\r\nbe; the districts have delegated it and at the same time retained it;\"\r\neach of them acts as if it were alone and supreme.--There are secondary\r\npowers, the district-committees, each with its president, its clerk, its\r\noffices, and commissioners; but the mobs of the street march on without\r\nawaiting their orders; while the people, shouting under their\" windows,\r\nimpose their will on them;--in short, says Bailly again, \"everybody knew\r\nhow to command, but nobody knew how to obey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Imagine,\" writes Loustalot[1402] himself; \"a man whose feet, hands, and\r\nlimbs possessed each its own intelligence and will, whose one leg would\r\nwish to walk when the other one wanted to rest, whose throat would close\r\nwhen the stomach demanded food, whose mouth would sing when the eyelids\r\nwere weighed down with sleep; and you will have a striking picture of\r\nthe condition of things in the capital\"\r\n\r\nThere are \"sixty Republics\"[1403] in Paris; each district is an\r\nindependent, isolated power, which receives no order without criticizing\r\nit, always in disagreement and often in conflict with the central\r\nauthority or with the other districts. It receives denunciations, orders\r\ndomiciliary visits, sends deputations to the National Assembly, passes\r\nresolutions, posts its bills, not only in its own quarter but throughout\r\nthe city, and sometimes even extends its jurisdiction outside of Paris.\r\nEverything comes within its province, and particularly that which\r\nought not to do so.--On the 18th of July, the district of\r\nPetits-Augustins[1404] \"decrees in its own name the establishment of\r\njustices of the peace,\" under the title of tribunes, and proceeds at\r\nonce to elect its own, nominating the actor Molé. On the 30th, that of\r\nthe Oratoire annuls the amnesty which the representatives of the commune\r\nin the Hôtel-de-Ville had granted, and orders two of its members to go\r\nto a distance of thirty leagues to arrest M. de Bezenval. On the 19th of\r\nAugust, that of Nazareth issues commissions to seize and bring to Paris\r\nthe arms deposited in strong places. From the beginning each assembly\r\nsent to the Arsenal in its own name, and \"obtained as many cartridges\r\nand as much powder as it desired.\" Others claim the right of keeping a\r\nwatchful eye over the Hôtel-de-Ville and of reprimanding the National\r\nAssembly. The Oratoire decides that the representatives of the commune\r\nshall be invited to deliberate in public. Saint-Nicholas des Champs\r\ndeliberates on the veto and begs the Assembly to suspend its vote.--It\r\nis a strange spectacle, that of these various authorities each\r\ncontradicting and destroying the other. To-day the Hôtel-de-Ville\r\nappropriates five loads of cloth which have been dispatched by the\r\nGovernment, and the district of Saint-Gervais opposes the decision of\r\nthe Hôtel-de-Ville. To-morrow Versailles intercepts grain destined\r\nfor Paris, while Paris threatens, if it is not restored, to march on\r\nVersailles. I omit the incidents that are ridiculous:[1405] anarchy\r\nin its essence is both tragic and grotesque, and, in this universal\r\nbreaking up of things, the capital, like the kingdom, resembles a\r\nbear-garden when it does not resemble a Babel.\r\n\r\nBut behind all these discordant authorities the real sovereign, who is\r\nthe mob, is very soon apparent.--On the 15th of July it undertakes the\r\ndemolition of the Bastille of its own accord, and this popular act is\r\nsanctioned; for it is necessary that appearances should be kept up;\r\neven to give orders after the blow is dealt, and to follow when it is\r\nimpossible to lead.[1406] A short time after this the collection of\r\nthe octroi at the barriers is ordered to be resumed; forty armed\r\nindividuals, however, present themselves in their district and say, that\r\nif guards are placed at the octroi stations, \"they will resist force\r\nwith force, and even make use of their cannon.\"--On the false rumor that\r\narms are concealed in the Abbey of Montmartre, the abbess, Madame de\r\nMontmorency, is accused of treachery, and twenty thousand persons invade\r\nthe monastery.--The commander of the National Guard and the mayor are\r\nconstantly expecting a riot; they hardly dare absent themselves a day\r\nto attend the King fête at Versailles. As soon as the multitude can\r\nassemble in the streets, an explosion is imminent. \"On rainy days,\" says\r\nBailly, \"I was quite at my ease.\"--It is under this constant pressure\r\nthat the Government is carried on; and the elect of the people, the most\r\nesteemed magistrates, those who are in best repute, are at the mercy of\r\nthe throng who clamor at their doors. In the district of St. Roch,[1407]\r\nafter many useless refusals, the General Assembly, notwithstanding all\r\nthe reproaches of its conscience and the resistance of its reason, is\r\nobliged to open letters addressed to Monsieur, to the Duke of Orleans,\r\nand to the Ministers of War, of Foreign Affairs, and of the Marine. In\r\nthe committee on subsistence, M. Serreau, who is indispensable and who\r\nis confirmed by a public proclamation, is denounced, threatened,\r\nand constrained to leave Paris. M. de la Salle, one of the strongest\r\npatriots among the nobles, is on the point of being murdered for having\r\nsigned an order for the transport of gunpowder;[1408] the multitude, in\r\npursuit of him, attach a rope to the nearest street-lamp, ransack the\r\nHôtel-de-Ville, force every door, mount into the belfry, and seek for\r\nthe traitor even under the carpet of the bureau and between the legs of\r\nthe electors, and are only stayed in their course by the arrival of the\r\nNational Guard.\r\n\r\nThe people not only sentence but they execute, and, as is always the\r\ncase, blindly. At Saint-Denis, Chatel, the mayor's lieutenant, whose\r\nduty it is to distribute flour, had reduced the price of bread at\r\nhis own expense: on the 3rd of August his house is forced open at two\r\no'clock in the morning, and he takes refuge in a steeple; the mob follow\r\nhim, cut his throat and drag his head along the streets.--Not only do\r\nthe people execute, but they pardon--and with equal discernment. On the\r\n11th of August, at Versailles, as a parricide is about to be broken on\r\nthe wheel, the crowd demand his release, fly at the executioner, and set\r\nthe man free.[1409] Veritably this is sovereign power like that of the\r\noriental sovereign who arbitrarily awards life or death! A woman who\r\nprotests against this scandalous pardon is seized and comes near being\r\nhung; for the new monarch considers as a crime whatever is offensive to\r\nhis new majesty. Again, he receives public and humble homage. The\r\nPrime Minister, on imploring the pardon of M. de Bezenval at the\r\nHôtel-de-Ville, in the presence of the electors and of the public, has\r\nput it in appropriate words:\r\n\r\n\"It is before the most unknown, the obscurest citizen of Paris that I\r\nprostrate myself; at whose feet I kneel.\"\r\n\r\nA few days before this, at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and at Poissy, the\r\ndeputies of the National Assembly not only kneel down in words, but\r\nactually, and for a long time, on the pavement in the street, and\r\nstretch forth their hands, weeping, to save two lives of which only\r\none is granted to them.--Behold the monarch by these brilliant signs!\r\nAlready do the young, who are eager imitators of all actions that are\r\nin fashion, ape them in miniature; during the month which follows the\r\nmurder of Berthier and Foulon, Bailly is informed that the gamins in the\r\nstreets are parading about with the heads of two cats stuck on the ends\r\nof two poles.[1410]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--The distress of the people.\r\n\r\n     The dearth and the lack of work.--How men of executive\r\n     ability are recruited.\r\n\r\nA pitiable monarch, whose recognized sovereignty leaves him more\r\nmiserable than he was before! Bread is always scarce, and before the\r\nbaker's doors the row of waiting people does not diminish. In vain\r\nBailly passes his nights with the committee on supplies; they are always\r\nin a state of terrible anxiety. Every morning for two months there is\r\nonly one or two days' supply of flour, and often, in the evening, there\r\nis not enough for the following morning.[1411] The life of the capital\r\ndepends on a convoy which is ten, fifteen, twenty leagues off; and which\r\nmay never arrive: one convoy of twenty carts is pillaged on the 18th of\r\nJuly, on the Rouen road; another, on the 4th of August, in the vicinity\r\nof Louviers. Were it not for Salis' Swiss regiment, which, from the 14th\r\nof July to the end of September, marches day and night as an escort,\r\nnot a boat-load of grain would reach Paris from Rouen.[1412]--The\r\ncommissaries charged with making purchases or with supervising the\r\nexpeditions are in danger of their lives. Those who are sent to\r\nprovinces are seized, and a column of four hundred men with cannon has\r\nto be dispatched to deliver them. The one who is sent to Rouen learns\r\nthat he will be hung if he dares to enter the place. At Mantes a mob\r\nsurrounds his cabriolet, the people regarding whoever comes there for\r\nthe purpose of carrying away grain as a public pest; he escapes with\r\ndifficulty out of a back door and returns on foot to Paris.--From the\r\nvery beginning, according to a universal rule, the fear of a short\r\nsupply helps to augment the famine. Every one lays in a stock for\r\nseveral days; on one occasion sixteen loaves of four pounds each are\r\nfound in an old woman's garret. The bakings, consequently, which are\r\nestimated according to the quantity needed for a single day, become\r\ninadequate, and the last of those who wait at the bakers' shops for\r\nbread return home empty-handed.--On the other hand the appropriations\r\nmade by the city and the State to diminish the price of bread simply\r\nserve to lengthen the rows of those who wait for it; the countrymen\r\nflock in thither, and return home loaded to their villages. At\r\nSaint-Denis, bread having been reduced to two sous the pound, none\r\nis left for the inhabitants. To this constant anxiety add that of\r\nunemployment. Not only is there no certainty of there being bread at the\r\nbakers' during the coming week, but many know that they will not have\r\nmoney in the coming week with which to buy bread. Now that security has\r\ndisappeared and the rights of property are shaken, work is wanting. The\r\nrich, deprived of their feudal dues, and, in addition thereto of their\r\nrents, have reduced their expenditure; many of them, threatened by the\r\ncommittee of investigation, exposed to domiciliary visits, and liable to\r\nbe informed against by their servants, have emigrated. In the month of\r\nSeptember M. Necker laments the delivery of six thousand passports in\r\nfifteen days to the wealthiest inhabitants. In the month of October\r\nladies of high rank, refugees in Rome, send word that their domestics\r\nshould be discharged and their daughters placed in convents. Before the\r\nend of 1789 there are so many fugitives in Switzerland that a house,\r\nit is said, brings in more rent than it is worth as capital. With this\r\nfirst emigration, which is that of the chief spendthrifts, the Count\r\nd'Artois, Prince de Conti, Duc de Bourbon, and so many others, the\r\nopulent foreigners have left, and, at the head of them, the Duchesse\r\nde l'Infantado, who spent 800,000 livres a year. There are only three\r\nEnglishmen in Paris.\r\n\r\nIt used to be a city of luxury, it was the European hot-house of costly\r\nand refined pleasures, but once the glass was broken then the delicate\r\nplants perish, their lovers leave, and there is no employment now for\r\nthe innumerable hands which cultivated them. Fortunate are they who at\r\nthe relief works obtain a miserable sum by handling a pick-axe! \"I saw,\"\r\nsays Bailly, \"mercers, jewellers, and merchants implore the favor of\r\nbeing employed at twenty sous the day.\" Enumerate, if you can, in one or\r\ntwo recognized callings, the hands which are doing nothing:[1413] 1,200\r\nhair-dressers keep about 6,000 journeymen; 2,000 others follow the same\r\ncalling in private-houses; 6,000 lackeys do but little else than this\r\nwork. The body of tailors is composed of 2,800 masters, who have under\r\nthem 5,000 workmen. \"Add to these the number privately employed--the\r\nrefugees in privileged places like the abbeys of Saint-Germain and\r\nSaint-Marcel, the vast enclosure of the Temple, that of Saint-John the\r\nLateran, and the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, and you will find at least\r\n12,000 persons cutting, fitting, and sewing.\" How many in these two\r\ngroups are now idle! How many others are walking the streets, such\r\nas upholsterers, lace-makers, embroiderers, fan-makers, gilders,\r\ncarnage-makers, binders, engravers, and all the other producers of\r\nParisian nick-nacks! For those who are still at work how many days are\r\nlost at the doors of bakers' shops and in patrolling as National\r\nGuards! Gatherings are formed in spite of the prohibitions of the\r\nHôtel-de-Ville,[1414] and the crowd openly discuss their miserable\r\ncondition: 3,000 journeymen-tailors near the Colonnade,\r\nas many journeymen-shoemakers in the Place Louis XV., the\r\njourneymen-hairdressers in the Champs-Elysees, 4,000 domestics without\r\nplaces on the approaches to the Louvre,--and their propositions are on a\r\nlevel with their intelligence. Servants demand the expulsion from\r\nParis of the Savoyards who enter into competition with them.\r\nJourneymen-tailors demand that a day's wages be fixed at forty sous, and\r\nthat the old-clothes dealers shall not be allowed to make new ones. The\r\njourneymen-shoemakers declare that those who make shoes below the fixed\r\nprice shall be driven out of the kingdom. Each of these irritated and\r\nagitated crowds contains the germ of an outbreak--and, in truth, these\r\ngerms are found on every pavement in Paris: at the relief works, which\r\nat Montmartre collect 17,000 paupers; in the Market, where the bakers\r\nwant to hang the flour commissioners, and at the doors of the bakers,\r\nof whom two, on the 14th of September and on the 5th of October, are\r\nconducted to the lamp post and barely escape with their lives.--In this\r\nsuffering, mendicant crowd, enterprising men become more numerous every\r\nday: they consist of deserters, and from every regiment; they reach\r\nParis in bands, often 250 in one day. There, \"caressed and fed to the\r\ntop of their bent,\"[1415] having received from the National Assembly\r\n50 livres each, maintained by the King in the enjoyment of their\r\nadvance-money, entertained by the districts, of which one alone incurs\r\na debt of 14,000 livres for wine and sausages furnished to them, \"they\r\naccustom themselves to greater expense,\" to greater license, and are\r\nfollowed by their companions. \"During the night of the 31st of July the\r\nFrench Guards on duty at Versailles abandon the custody of the King and\r\nbetake themselves to Paris, without their officers, but with their arms\r\nand baggage,\" that \"they may take part in the cheer which the city of\r\nParis extends to their regiment.\" At the beginning of September, 16,000\r\ndeserters of this stamp are counted.[1416] Now, among those who commit\r\nmurder these are in the first rank; and this is not surprising when we\r\ntake the least account of their antecedents, education, and habits. It\r\nwas a soldier of the \"Royal Croat\" who tore out the heart of Berthier.\r\nThey were three soldiers of the regiment of Provence who forced the\r\nhouse of Chatel at Saint-Denis, and dragged his head through\r\nthe streets. It is Swiss soldiers who, at Passy, knock down the\r\ncommissioners of police with their guns. Their headquarters are at the\r\nPalais-Royal, amongst women whose instruments they are, and amongst\r\nagitators from whom they receive the word of command. Henceforth, all\r\ndepends on this word, and we have only to contemplate the new popular\r\nleaders to know what it will be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--The new popular leaders.\r\n\r\n     Their ascendancy.--Their education.--Their sentiments.\r\n     --Their situation.--Their councils.--Their denunciations.\r\n\r\nAdministrators and members of district assemblies, agitators of\r\nbarracks, coffee-houses, clubs and public thoroughfares, writers of\r\npamphlets, penny-a-liners are multiplying as fast as buzzing insects are\r\nhatched on a sultry night. After the 14th of July thousands of jobs have\r\nbecome available for released ambitions; \"attorneys, notaries'\r\nclerks, artists, merchants, shopkeepers, comedians and especially\r\nadvocates;[1417] each wants to be either an officer, a director, a\r\ncouncillor, or a minister of the new reign; while journals, which are\r\nestablished by dozens,[1418] form a permanent tribune, where speakers\r\ncome to court the people to their personal advantage.\" Philosophy,\r\nfallen into such hands, seems to parody itself; and nothing equals its\r\nemptiness, unless it be its mischievousness and success. Lawyers, in\r\nthe sixty assembly districts, roll out the high-sounding dogmas of the\r\nrevolutionary catechism. This or that one, passing from the question\r\nof a party wall to the constitution of empires, becomes the improvised\r\nlegislator, so much the more inexhaustible and the more applauded as\r\nhis flow of words, showered upon his hearers, proves to them that every\r\ncapacity and every right are naturally and legitimately theirs.\r\n\r\n\"When that man opened his mouth,\" says a cold-blooded witness, \"we were\r\nsure of being inundated with quotations and maxims, often apropos of\r\nstreet lamp posts, or of the stall of a herb-dealer. His stentorian\r\nvoice made the vaults ring; and after he had spoken for two hours,\r\nand his breath was completely exhausted, the admiring and enthusiastic\r\nshouts which greeted him amounted almost to frenzy. Thus the orator\r\nfancied himself a Mirabeau, while the spectators imagined themselves the\r\nConstituent Assembly, deciding the fate of France.\"\r\n\r\nThe journals and pamphlets are written in the same style. Every brain\r\nis filled with the fumes of conceit and of big words; the leader of the\r\ncrowd is he who raves the most, and he guides the wild enthusiasm which\r\nhe increases.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the most popular of these chiefs; they are the green or\r\nthe dry fruit of literature, and of the bar. The newspaper is the\r\nstall which every morning offers them for sale, and if they suit the\r\noverexcited public it is simply owing to their acid or bitter flavor.\r\nTheir empty, unpracticed minds are wholly void of political conceptions;\r\nthey have no capacity or practical experience. Desmoulins is twenty-nine\r\nyears of age, Loustalot twenty-seven, and their intellectual ballast\r\nconsists of college reminiscences, souvenirs of the law schools, and the\r\ncommon-places picked up in the houses of Raynal and his associates.\r\nAs to Brissot and Marat, who are ostentatious humanitarians, their\r\nknowledge of France and of foreign countries consists in what they have\r\nseen through the dormer windows of their garrets, and through utopian\r\nspectacles. In minds like these, empty or led astray, the Contrat-Social\r\ncould not fail to become a gospel; for it reduces political science to\r\na strict application of an elementary axiom which relieves them of all\r\nstudy, and hands society over to the caprice of the people, or, in other\r\nwords, delivers it into their own hands.--Hence they demolish all\r\nthat remains of social institutions, and push on equalization until\r\neverything is brought down to the same level.\r\n\r\n\"With my principles,\" writes Desmoulins,[1419] \"is associated the\r\nsatisfaction of putting myself where I belong, of showing my strength to\r\nthose who have despised me, of lowering to my level all whom fortune has\r\nplaced above me: my motto is that of all honest people: 'No superiors!'\"\r\n\r\nThus, under the great name of Liberty, each vain spirit seeks its\r\nrevenge and finds its nourishment. What is sweeter and more natural than\r\nto justify passion by theory, to be factious in the belief that this is\r\npatriotism, and to cloak the interests of ambition with the interests of\r\nhumanity?\r\n\r\nLet us picture to ourselves these directors of public opinion as they\r\nwere three months earlier: Desmoulins, a briefless barrister, living in\r\nfurnished lodgings with petty debts, and on a few louis extracted from\r\nhis relations. Loustalot, still more unknown, was admitted the previous\r\nyear to the Parliament of Bordeaux, and has landed at Paris in search of\r\na career. Danton, another second-rate lawyer, coming out of a hovel in\r\nChampagne, borrowed the money to pay his expenses, while his stinted\r\nhousehold is kept up only by means of a louis which is given to him\r\nweekly by his father-in-law, who is a coffee-house keeper. Brissot, a\r\nstrolling Bohemian, formerly employee of literary pirates, has roamed\r\nover the world for fifteen years, without bringing back with him either\r\nfrom England or America anything but a coat out at elbows and false\r\nideas; and, finally, Marat; a writer that has been hissed, an abortive\r\nscholar and philosopher, a misrepresenter of his own experiences, caught\r\nby the natural philosopher Charles in the act of committing a scientific\r\nfraud, and fallen from the top of his inordinate ambition to the\r\nsubordinate post of doctor in the stables of the Comte d'Artois.--At the\r\npresent time, Danton, President of the Cordeliers, can arrest any one he\r\npleases in his district, and his violent gestures and thundering voice\r\nsecure to him, till something better turns up, the government of his\r\nsection of the city. A word of Marat's has just caused Major Belzunce at\r\nCaen to be assassinated. Desmoulins announces, with a smile of triumph,\r\nthat \"a large section of the capital regards him as one among the\r\nprincipal instigators of the Revolution, and that many even go so far as\r\nto say that he is the author of it.\" Is it to be supposed that, borne so\r\nhigh by such a sudden jerk of fortune, they wish to put on the drag and\r\nagain descend? and is it not clear that they will aid with all\r\ntheir might the revolt which hoists them towards the loftiest\r\nsummits?--Moreover, the brain reels at a height like this; suddenly\r\nlaunched in the air and feeling as if everything was tottering around\r\nthem, they utter exclamations of indignation and terror, they see plots\r\non all sides, imagine invisible cords pulling in an opposite direction,\r\nand they call upon the people to cut them. With the full weight of their\r\ninexperience, incapacity, and improvidence, of their fears, credulity,\r\nand dogmatic obstinacy, they urge on popular attacks, and their\r\nnewspaper articles or discourses are all summed up in the following\r\nphrases:\r\n\r\n\"Fellow-citizens, you, the people of the lower class, you who listen\r\nto me, you have enemies in the Court and the aristocracy. The\r\nHôtel-de-Ville and the National Assembly are your servants. Seize your\r\nenemies with a strong hand, and hang them, and let your servants know\r\nthat they must quicken their steps!\"\r\n\r\nDesmoulins styles himself \"District-attorney of the gallows,\"[1420] and\r\nif he at all regrets the murders of Foulon and Berthier, it is because\r\nthis too expeditious judgment has allowed the proofs of conspiracy to\r\nperish, thereby saving a number of traitors: he himself mentions twenty\r\nof them haphazard, and little does he care whether he makes mistakes.\r\n\r\n\"We are in the dark, and it is well that faithful dogs should bark, even\r\nat all who pass by, so that there may be no fear of robbers.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this time forth Marat[1421] denounces the King, the ministers,\r\nthe administration, the bench, the bar, the financial system and the\r\nacademies, all as \"suspicious;\" at all events the people only suffer on\r\ntheir account.\r\n\r\n\"The Government is monopolizing grain, to make us to pay through the\r\nnose for a poisonous bread.\"\r\n\r\nThe Government, again, through a new conspiracy is about to blockade\r\nParis, so as to starve it with greater ease. Utterances of this kind,\r\nat such a time, are firebrands thrown upon fear and hunger to kindle\r\nthe flames of rage and cruelty. To this frightened and fasting crowd the\r\nagitators and newspaper writers continue to repeat that it must act,\r\nand act alongside of the authorities, and, if need be, against them.\r\nIn other words, We will do as we please; we are the sole legitimate\r\nmasters;\r\n\r\n\"in a well-constituted government, the people as a body are the real\r\nsovereign: our delegates are appointed only to execute our orders; what\r\nright has the clay to rebel against the potter?\"\r\n\r\nOn the strength of such principles, the tumultuous club which occupies\r\nthe Palais-Royal substitutes itself for the Assembly at Versailles.\r\nHas it not all the titles for this office? The Palais-Royal \"saved the\r\nnation\" on the 12th and 13th of July. The Palais-Royal, \"through its\r\nspokesmen and pamphlets,\" has made everybody and even the soldiers\r\n\"philosophers.\" It is the house of patriotism, \"the rendezvous of the\r\nselect among the patriotic,\" whether provincials or Parisians, of all\r\nwho possess the right of suffrage, and who cannot or will not exercise\r\nit in their own district. \"It saves time to come to the Palais-Royal.\r\nThere is no need there of appealing to the President for the right to\r\nspeak, or to wait one's time for a couple of hours. The orator proposes\r\nhis motion, and, if it finds supporters, mounts a chair. If he is\r\napplauded, it is put into proper shape. If he is hissed, he goes away.\r\nThis was the way of the Romans.\" Behold the veritable National Assembly!\r\nIt is superior to the other semi-feudal affair, encumbered with \"six\r\nhundred deputies of the clergy and nobility,\" who are so many intruders\r\nand who \"should be sent out into the galleries.\"--Hence the pure\r\nAssembly rules the impure Assembly, and \"the Café Foy lays claim to the\r\ngovernment of France.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--Intervention by the popular leaders with the Government.\r\n\r\n     Their pressure on the Assembly.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of July, the harlequin who led the insurrection at Rouen\r\nhaving been arrested, \"it is openly proposed at the Palais Royal[1422]\r\nto go in a body and demand his release.\"--On the 1st of August, Thouret,\r\nwhom the moderate party of the Assembly have just made President, is\r\nobliged to resign; the Palais-Royal threatens to send a band and murder\r\nhim along with those who voted for him, and lists of proscriptions,\r\nin which several of the deputies are inscribed, begin to be\r\ncirculated.--From this time forth, on all great questions-the abolition\r\nof the feudal system, the suppression of tithes, a declaration of the\r\nrights of man, the dispute about the Chambers, the King's power of\r\nveto,[1423] the pressure from without inclines the balance: in this\r\nway the Declaration of Rights, which is rejected in secret session by\r\ntwenty-eight bureaus out of thirty, is forced through by the tribunes in\r\na public sitting and passed by a majority.--Just as before the 14th of\r\nJuly, and to a still greater extent, two kinds of compulsion influence\r\nthe votes, and it is always the ruling faction which employs both its\r\nhands to throttle its opponents. On the one hand this faction takes post\r\non the galleries in knots composed nearly always of the same persons,\r\n\"five or six hundred permanent actors,\" who yell according to understood\r\nsignals and at the word of command.[1424] Many of these are French\r\nGuards, in civilian clothes, and who relieve each other: previously\r\nthey have asked of their favorite deputy \"at what hour they must come,\r\nwhether all goes on well, and whether he is satisfied with those fools\r\nof parsons (calotins) and the aristocrats.\" Others consist of low women\r\nunder the command of Théroigne de Méricourt, a virago courtesan, who\r\nassigns them their positions and gives them the signal for hooting\r\nor for applause. Publicly and in full session, on the occasion of the\r\ndebate on the veto, \"the deputies are applauded or insulted by the\r\ngalleries according as they utter the word 'suspensive,' or the word\r\n'indefinite.' \"Threats,\" (says one of them) \"circulated; I heard\r\nthem on all sides around me.\" These threats are repeated on going out:\r\n\"Valets dismissed by their masters, deserters, and women in rags,\"\r\nthreaten the refractory with the lamp post, \"and thrust their fists in\r\ntheir faces. In the hall itself, and much more accurately than before\r\nthe 14th of July, their names are taken down, and the lists, handed\r\nover to the populace,\" travel to the Palais-Royal, from where they\r\nare dispatched in correspondence and in newspapers to the\r\nprovinces.[1425]--Thus we see the second means of compulsion; each\r\ndeputy is answerable for his vote, at Paris, with his own life, and,\r\nin the province, with those of his family. Members of the former\r\nThird-Estate avow that they abandon the idea of two Chambers, because\r\n\"they are not disposed to get their wives' and children's throats cut.\"\r\nOn the 30th of August, Saint-Hurugue, the most noisy of the Palais-Royal\r\nbarkers, marches off to Versailles, at the head of 1,500 men, to\r\ncomplete the conversion of the Assembly. This garden club indeed, from\r\nthe heights of its great learning, integrity, and immaculate reputation,\r\ndecides that the ignorant, corrupt, and doubtful deputies must be got\r\nrid of.\" That they are such cannot be questioned, because they defend\r\nthe royal sanction; there are over 600 and more, 120 are deputies of the\r\ncommunes, who must be expelled to begin with, and then must be brought\r\nto judgment.[1426] In the meantime they are informed, as well as the\r\nBishop of Langres, President of the National Assembly, that \"15,000 men\r\nare ready to light up their chateaux and in particular yours, sir.\"\r\nTo avoid all mistake, the secretaries of the Assembly are informed\r\nin writing that '2,000 letters\" will be sent into the provinces to\r\ndenounce to the people the conduct of the malignant deputies: \"Your\r\nhouses are held as a surety for your opinions: keep this in mind, and\r\nsave yourselves!\" At last, on the morning of the 1st of August, five\r\ndeputations from the Palais-Royal, one of them led by Loustalot, march\r\nin turn to the Hôtel-de-Ville, insisting that the drums should be beaten\r\nand the citizens be called together for the purpose of changing the\r\ndeputies, or their instructions, and of ordering the National Assembly\r\nto suspend its discussion on the veto until the districts and provinces\r\ncould give expression to their will: the people, in effect, alone being\r\nsovereign, and alone competent, always has the right to dismiss or\r\ninstruct anew its servants, the deputies. On the following day, August\r\n2nd, to make matters plainer, new delegates from the same Palais-Royal\r\nsuit gestures to words; they place two fingers on their throats, on\r\nbeing introduced before the representatives of the commune, as a hint\r\nthat, if the latter do not obey, they will be hung.\r\n\r\nAfter this it is vain for the National Assembly to make any show of\r\nindignation, to declare that it despises threats, and to protest its\r\nindependence; the impression is already produced. \"More than 300 members\r\nof the communes,\" says Mounier, \"had decided to support the absolute\r\nveto.\" At the end of ten days most of these had gone over, several of\r\nthem through attachment to the King, because they were afraid of \"a\r\ngeneral uprising,\" and \"were not willing to jeopardize the lives of the\r\nroyal family.\" But concessions like these only provoke fresh extortions.\r\nThe politicians of the street now know by experience the effect of\r\nbrutal violence on legal authority. Emboldened by success and by\r\nimpunity, they reckon up their strength and the weakness of the latter.\r\nOne blow more, and they are undisputed masters. Besides, the issue is\r\nalready apparent to clear-sighted men. When the agitators of the public\r\nthoroughfares, and the porters at the street-corners, convinced of their\r\nsuperior wisdom, impose decrees by the strength of their lungs, of their\r\nfists, and of their pikes, at that moment experience, knowledge, good\r\nsense, cool-blood, genius, and judgment, disappear from human affairs,\r\nand things revert back to chaos. Mirabeau, in favor of the veto for\r\nlife, saw the crowd imploring him with tears in their eyes to change his\r\nopinion:\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur le Comte, if the King obtains this veto, what will be the use\r\nof a National Assembly? We shall all be slaves \"[1427]\r\n\r\nOutbursts of this description are not to be resisted, and all is lost.\r\nAlready, near the end of September, the remark applies which Mirabeau\r\nmakes to the Comte de la Marck:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, all is lost; the King and Queen will be swept away, and you will\r\nsee the populace trampling on their lifeless bodies.\"\r\n\r\nEight days after this, on the 5th and 6th of October, it breaks out\r\nagainst both King and Queen, against the National Assembly and the\r\nGovernment, against all government present and to come; the violent\r\nparty which rules in Paris obtains possession of the chiefs of France\r\nto hold them under strict surveillance, and to justify its intermittent\r\noutrages by one permanent outrage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--The 5th and 6th of October.\r\n\r\nOnce more, two different currents combine into one torrent to hurry the\r\ncrowd onward to a common end.--On the one hand are the cravings of the\r\nstomach, and women excited by the famine:\r\n\r\n\"Now that bread cannot be had in Paris, let us go to Versailles and\r\ndemand it there; once we have the King, Queen, and Dauphin in the midst\r\nof us, they will be obliged to feed us;\" we will bring back \"the Baker,\r\nthe Bakeress, and the Baker's boy.\" --On the other hand, there is\r\nfanaticism, and men who are pushed on by the need to dominate.\r\n\r\n\"Now that our chiefs yonder disobey us,--let us go and make them obey us\r\nforthwith; the King is quibbling over the Constitution and the Rights of\r\nMan--make him approve them; his guards refuse to wear our cockade--make\r\nthem accept it; they want to carry him off to Metz--make him come to\r\nParis, here, under our eyes and in our hands, he, and the lame Assembly\r\ntoo, will march straight on, and quickly, whether they like it or not,\r\nand always on the right road.\"--Under this confluence of ideas the\r\nexpedition is arranged.[1428] Ten days before this, it is publicly\r\nalluded to at Versailles. On the 4th of October, at Paris, a woman\r\nproposes it at the Palais-Royal; Danton roars at the Cordeliers;\r\nMarat, \"alone, makes as much noise as the four trumpets on the Day of\r\nJudgment.\" Loustalot writes that a second revolutionary paroxysm is\r\nnecessary.\" \"The day passes,\" says Desmoulins, \"in holding councils at\r\nthe Palais-Royal, and in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, on the ends of\r\nthe bridges, and on the quays... in pulling off the cockades of but one\r\ncolor.... These are torn off and trampled under foot with threats of the\r\nlamp post, in case of fresh offense; a soldier who is trying to\r\nrefasten his, changes his mind on seeing a hundred sticks raised against\r\nhim.\"[1429] These are the premonitory symptoms of a crisis; a huge ulcer\r\nhas formed in this feverish, suffering body, and it is about to break.\r\n\r\nBut, as is usually the case, it is a purulent concentration of the most\r\npoisonous passions and the foulest motives. The vilest of men and\r\nwomen were engaged in it. Money was freely distributed. Was it done by\r\nintriguing subalterns who, playing upon the aspirations of the Duke of\r\nOrleans, extracted millions from him under the pretext of making him\r\nlieutenant-general of the kingdom? Or is it due to the fanatics who,\r\nfrom the end of April, clubbed together to debauch the soldiery, and\r\nstir up a body of ruffians for the purpose of leveling and destroying\r\neverything around them?[1430] There are always Machiavellis of the\r\nhighways and of houses of ill-fame ready to excite the foul and the\r\nvile of both sexes. On the first day that the Flemish regiment goes into\r\ngarrison at Versailles an attempt is made to corrupt it with money and\r\nwomen. Sixty abandoned women are sent from Paris for this purpose, while\r\nthe French Guards come and treat their new comrades. The latter have\r\nbeen treated at the Palais-Royal, while three of them, at Versailles,\r\nexclaim, showing some crown pieces of six livres, \"What a pleasure it\r\nis to go to Paris! one always comes back with money!\" In this way,\r\nresistance is overcome beforehand. As to the attack, women are to be the\r\nadvanced guard, because the soldiers will scruple to fire at them;\r\ntheir ranks, however, will be reinforced by a number of men disguised\r\nas women. On looking closely at them they are easily recognized,\r\nnotwithstanding their rouge, by their badly-shaven beards, and by their\r\nvoices and gait.[1431] No difficulty has been found in obtaining men\r\nand women among the prostitutes of the Palais-Royal and the military\r\ndeserters who serve them as bullies. It is probable that the former lent\r\ntheir lovers the cast-off dresses they had to spare. At night all will\r\nmeet again at the common rendezvous, on the benches of the National\r\nAssembly, where they are quite as much at home as in their own\r\nhouses.[1432]--In any event, the first band which marches out is of this\r\nstamp, displaying the finery and the gaiety of the profession; \"most of\r\nthem young, dressed in white, with powdered hair and a sprightly air;\"\r\nmany of them \"laughing, singing, and drinking,\" as they would do at\r\nsetting out for a picnic in the country. Three or four of them are known\r\nby name--one brandishing a sword, and another, the notorious Théroigne.\r\nMadeleine Chabry Louison, who is selected to address the King, is a\r\npretty grisette who sells flowers, and, no doubt, something else, at the\r\nPalais-Royal. Some appear to belong to the first rank in their calling,\r\nand to have tact and the manners of society--suppose, for instance,\r\nthat Champfort and Laclos sent their mistresses. To these must be added\r\nwasherwomen, beggars, bare-footed women, and fishwomen, enlisted for\r\nseveral days before and paid accordingly. This is the first nucleus,\r\nand it keeps on growing; for, by compulsion or consent, the\r\ntroop incorporates into it, as it passes along, all the women it\r\nencounters--seamstresses, portresses, housekeepers, and even respectable\r\nfemales, whose dwellings are entered with threats of cutting off\r\ntheir hair if they do not fall in. To these must be added vagrants,\r\nstreet-rovers, ruffians and robbers--the lees of Paris, which accumulate\r\nand come to the surface every time agitation occurs: they are to be\r\nfound already at the first hour, behind the troop of women at the\r\nHôtel-de-Ville. Others are to follow during the evening and in the\r\nnight. Others are waiting at Versailles. Many, both at Paris and\r\nVersailles, are under pay: one, in a dirty whitish vest, chinks gold and\r\nsilver coin in his hand.--Such is the foul scum which, both in front and\r\nin the rear, rolls along with the popular tide; whatever is done to stem\r\nthe torrent, it widens out and will leave its mark at every stage of its\r\noverflow.\r\n\r\nThe first troop, consisting of four or five hundred women, begin\r\noperations by forcing the guard of the Hôtel-de-Ville, which is\r\nunwilling to make use of its bayonets. They spread through the rooms\r\nand try to burn all the written documents they can find, declaring that\r\nthere has been nothing but scribbling since the Revolution began.[1433]\r\nA crowd of men follow after them, bursting open doors, and pillaging\r\nthe magazine of arms. Two hundred thousand francs in Treasury notes are\r\nstolen or disappear; several of the ruffians set fire to the building,\r\nwhile others hang an abbé. The abbé is cut down, and the fire\r\nextinguished only just in time: such are the interludes of the popular\r\ndrama. In the meantime, the crowd of women increases on the Place de\r\nGrève, always with the same unceasing cry, \"Bread!\" and \"To Versailles!\"\r\nOne of the conquerors of the Bastille; the usher Maillard, offers\r\nhimself as a leader. He is accepted, and taps his drum; on leaving\r\nParis, he has seven or eight thousand women with him, and, in addition,\r\nsome hundreds of men; by dint of remonstrances, he succeeds in\r\nmaintaining some kind of order amongst this rabble as far as\r\nVersailles.--But it is a rabble notwithstanding, and consequently so\r\nmuch brute force, at once anarchical and imperious. On the one hand,\r\neach, and the worst among them, does what he pleases--which will be\r\nquite evident this very evening. On the other hand, its ponderous mass\r\ncrushes all authority and overrides all rules and regulations--which is\r\nat once apparent on reaching Versailles.--Admitted into the Assembly, at\r\nfirst in small numbers, the women crowd against the door, push in with a\r\nrush, fill the galleries, then the hall, the men along with them, armed\r\nwith clubs, halberds, and pikes, all pell-mell, side by side with the\r\ndeputies, taking possession of their benches, voting along with them,\r\nand gathering about the President, who, surrounded, threatened, and\r\ninsulted, finally abandons the position, while his chair is taken by\r\na woman.[1434] A fishwoman commands in a gallery, and about a hundred\r\nwomen around her shout or keep silence at her bidding, while she\r\ninterrupts and abuses the deputies:\r\n\r\n\"Who is that speaker there? Silence that blabbermouth; he does not know\r\nwhat he is talking about. The question is how to get bread. Let papa\r\nMirabeau speak--we want to hear him.\"\r\n\r\nA decree on subsistence having been passed, the leaders demand something\r\nin addition; they must be allowed to enter all places where they suspect\r\nany monopolizing to be going on, and the price of \"bread must be fixed\r\nat six sous the four pounds, and meat at six sous per pound.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must not think that we are children to be played with. We are ready\r\nto strike. Do as you are bidden.\"\r\n\r\nAll their political injunctions emanate from this central idea. And\r\nfurther:\r\n\r\n\"Send back the Flemish regiment--it is a thousand men more to feed, and\r\nthey take bread out of our mouths.\"--\"Punish the aristocrats, who hinder\r\nthe bakers from baking.\" \"Down with the skull-cap; the priests are the\r\ncause of our trouble!\"--\"Monsieur Mounier, why did you advocate that\r\nvillainous veto? Beware of the lamp post!\"\r\n\r\nUnder this pressure, a deputation of the Assembly, with the President at\r\nits head, sets out on foot, in the mud, through the rain, and watched by\r\na howling escort of women and men armed with pikes: after five hours\r\nof waiting and entreaty, it wrings from the King, besides the decree on\r\nsubsistence, about which there was no difficulty, the acceptance,\r\npure and simple, of the Declaration of Rights, and his sanction to the\r\nconstitutional articles.--Such is the independence of the King and the\r\nAssembly.[1435] Thus are the new principles of justice established, the\r\ngrand outlines of the Constitution, the abstract axioms of political\r\ntruth under the dictatorship of a crowd which extorts not only blindly,\r\nbut which is half-conscious of its blindness.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur le President,\" some among the women say to Mounier, who\r\nreturns with the Royal sanction, \"will it be of any real use to us? will\r\nit give poor folks bread in Paris?\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the scum has been bubbling up around the chateau; and the\r\nabandoned women subsidized in Paris are pursuing their calling.[1436]\r\nThey slip through into the lines of the regiment drawn on the square, in\r\nspite of the sentinels. Théroigne, in an Amazonian red vest, distributes\r\nmoney among them.\r\n\r\n\"Side with us,\" some say to the men; \"we shall soon beat the King's\r\nGuards, strip off their fine coats and sell them.\"\r\n\r\nOthers lie sprawling on the ground, alluring the soldiers, and make such\r\noffers as to lead one of them to exclaim, \"We are going to have a jolly\r\ntime of it!\" Before the day is over, the regiment is seduced; the women\r\nhave, according to their own idea, acted for a good motive. When a\r\npolitical idea finds its way into such heads, instead of ennobling them,\r\nit becomes degraded there; its only effect is to let loose vices which a\r\nremnant of modesty still keeps in subjection, and full play is given to\r\nluxurious or ferocious instincts under cover of the public good.--The\r\npassions, moreover, become intensified through their mutual interaction;\r\ncrowds, clamor, disorder, longings, and fasting, end in a state of\r\nfrenzy, from which nothing can issue but dizzy madness and rage.--This\r\nfrenzy began to show itself on the way. Already, on setting out, a woman\r\nhad exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"We shall bring back the Queen's head on the end of a pike!\"[1437]\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Sèvres bridge others added,\r\n\r\n\"Let us cut her throat, and make cockades of her entrails!\"\r\n\r\nRain is falling; they are cold, tired, and hungry, and get nothing to\r\neat but a bit of bread, distributed at a late hour, and with difficulty,\r\non the Place d'Armes. One of the bands cuts up a slaughtered horse,\r\nroasts it, and consumes it half raw, after the manner of savages. It is\r\nnot surprising that, under the names of patriotism and \"justice,\" savage\r\nideas spring up in their minds against \"members of the National Assembly\r\nwho are not with the principles of the people,\" against \"the Bishop\r\nof Langres, Mounier, and the rest.\" One man in a ragged old red coat\r\ndeclares that \"he must have the head of the Abbé Maury to play nine-pins\r\nwith.\" But it is especially against the Queen, who is a woman, and in\r\nsight, that the feminine imagination is the most aroused.\r\n\r\n\"She alone is the cause of the evils we endure.... she must be killed,\r\nand quartered.\" --Night advances; there are acts of violence, and\r\nviolence engenders violence.\r\n\r\n\"How glad I should be,\" says one man, \"if I could only lay my hand on\r\nthat she-devil, and strike off her head on the first curbstone!\"\r\n\r\nTowards morning, some cry out,\r\n\r\n\"Where is that cursed cat? We must eat her heart out... We'll take\r\noff her head, cut her heart out, and fry her liver!\" --With the first\r\nmurders the appetite for blood has been awakened; the women from Paris\r\nsay that \"they have brought tubs to carry away the stumps of the\r\nRoyal Guards,\" and at these words others clap their hands. Some of the\r\nriffraff of the crowd examine the rope of the lamp post in the court of\r\nthe National Assembly, and judging it not to be sufficiently strong, are\r\ndesirous of supplying its place with another \"to hang the Archbishop\r\nof Paris, Maury, and d'Espréménil.\"--This murderous, carnivorous rage\r\npenetrates even among those whose duty it is to maintain order, one\r\nof the National Guard being heard to say that \"the body-guards must be\r\nkilled to the last man, and their hearts torn out for a breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, towards midnight, the National Guard of Paris arrives; but\r\nit only adds one insurrection to another, for it has likewise mutinied\r\nagainst its chiefs.[1438]\r\n\r\n\"If M. de Lafayette is not disposed to accompany us,\" says one of the\r\ngrenadiers, \"we will take an old grenadier for our commander.\"\r\n\r\nHaving come to this decision, they sought the general at the\r\nHôtel-de-Ville, and the delegates of six of the companies made their\r\ninstructions known to him.\r\n\r\n\"General, we do not believe that you are a traitor, but we think that\r\nthe Government is betraying us.... The committee on subsistence is\r\ndeceiving us, and must be removed. We want to go to Versailles to\r\nexterminate the body-guard and the Flemish regiment who have trampled\r\non the national cockade. If the King of France is too feeble to wear\r\nhis crown, let him take it off; we will crown his son and things will go\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\nIn vain Lafayette refuses, and harangues them on the Place de Grève; in\r\nvain he resists for hours, now addressing them and now imposing silence.\r\nArmed bands, coming from the Faubourgs Saint-Antoine and Saint-Marceau,\r\nswell the crowd; they take aim at him; others prepare the lamp-post. He\r\nthen dismounts and endeavors to return to the Hôtel-de-Ville, but his\r\ngrenadiers bar the way:\r\n\r\n\"Morbleu, General, you will stay with us; you will not abandon us!\"\r\n\r\nBeing their chief it is pretty plain that he must follow them; which\r\nis also the sentiment of the representatives of the commune at the\r\nHôtel-de-Ville, who send him their authorization, and even the order to\r\nmarch, \"seeing that it is impossible for him to refuse.\"\r\n\r\nFifteen thousand men thus reach Versailles, and in front of and along\r\nwith them thousands of ruffians, protected by the darkness. On this side\r\nthe National Guard of Versailles, posted around the chateau, together\r\nwith the people of Versailles, who bar the way against vehicles, have\r\nclosed up every outlet.[1439] The King is prisoner in his own palace,\r\nhe and his, with his ministers and his court, and with no defense. For,\r\nwith his usual optimism, he has confided the outer posts of the chateau\r\nto Lafayette's soldiers, and, through a humanitarian obstinacy which he\r\nis to maintain up to the last,[1440] he has forbidden his own guards\r\nto fire on the crowd, so that they are only there for show. With common\r\nright in his favor, the law, and the oath which Lafayette had just\r\nobliged his troops to renew, what could he have to fear? What could be\r\nmore effective with the people than trust in them and prudence? And by\r\nplaying the sheep one is sure of taming brutes!\r\n\r\nFrom five o'clock in the morning they prowl around the palace-railings.\r\nLafayette, exhausted with fatigue, has taken an hour's repose,[1441]\r\nwhich hour suffices for them.[1442] A populace armed with pikes and\r\nclubs, men and women, surrounds a squad of eighty-eight National Guards,\r\nforces them to fire on the King's Guards, bursts open a door, seizes\r\ntwo of the guards and chops their heads off. The executioner, who is a\r\nstudio model, with a heavy beard, stretches out his blood-stained hands\r\nand glories in the act; and so great is the effect on the National Guard\r\nthat they move off; through sensibility, in order not to witness such\r\nsights: such is the resistance! In the meantime the crowd invade the\r\nstaircases, beat down and trample on the guards they encounter, and\r\nburst open the doors with imprecations against the Queen. The Queen runs\r\noff; just in time, in her underclothes; she takes refuge with the King\r\nand the rest of the royal family, who have in vain barricaded themselves\r\nin the oeil-de-Boeuf, a door of which is broken in: here they stand,\r\nawaiting death, when Lafayette arrives with his grenadiers and saves\r\nall that can be saved--their lives, and nothing more. For, from the crowd\r\nhuddled in the marble court the shout rises, \"To Paris with the King!\" a\r\ncommand to which the King submits.\r\n\r\nNow that the great hostage is in their hands, will they deign to accept\r\nthe second one? This is doubtful. On the Queen approaching the balcony\r\nwith her son and daughter, a howl arises of \"No children!\" They want to\r\nhave her alone in the sights of their guns, and she understands that. At\r\nthis moment M. de Lafayette, throwing the shield of his popularity over\r\nher, appears on the balcony at her side and respectfully kisses her\r\nhand. The reaction is instantaneous in this over-excited crowd. Both\r\nthe men and especially the women, in such a state of nervous tension,\r\nreadily jump from one extreme to another, rage bordering on tears. A\r\nportress, who is a companion of Maillard's,[1443] imagines that she\r\nhears Lafayette promise in the Queen's name \"to love her people and be\r\nas much attached to them as Jesus Christ to his Church.\" People sob and\r\nembrace each other; the grenadiers shift their caps to the heads of the\r\nbody-guard. Everything will be fine: \"the people have won their King\r\nback.\"--Nothing is to be done now but to rejoice; and the cortege moves\r\non. The royal family and a hundred deputies, in carriages, form the\r\ncenter, and then comes the artillery, with a number of women bestriding\r\nthe cannons; next, a convoy of flour. Round about are the King's Guards,\r\neach with a National Guard mounted behind him; then comes the National\r\nGuard of Paris, and after them men with pikes and women on foot, on\r\nhorseback, in cabs, and on carts; in front is a band bearing two severed\r\nheads on the ends of two poles, which halts at a hairdresser's, in\r\nSèvres, to have these heads powdered and curled;[1444] they are made to\r\nbow by way of salutation, and are daubed all over with cream; there are\r\njokes and shouts of laughter; the people stop to eat and drink on the\r\nroad, and oblige the guards to clink glasses with them; they shout and\r\nfire salvos of musketry; men and women hold each other's hands and\r\nsing and dance about in the mud.--Such is the new fraternity: a funeral\r\nprocession of legal and legitimate authorities, a triumph of brutality\r\nover intelligence, a murderous and political Mardi-gras, a formidable\r\nmasquerade which, preceded by the insignia of death, drags along with it\r\nthe heads of France, the King, the ministers, and the deputies, that it\r\nmay constrain them to rule to until according to its frenzy, that it may\r\nhold them under its them pikes until it is pleased to slaughter them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--The Government and the nation in the hands of the revolutionary\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nThis time there can be no mistake: the Reign of Terror is fully and\r\nfirmly established. On this very day the mob stops a vehicle, in which\r\nit hopes to find M. de Virieu, and declares, on searching it, that \"they\r\nare looking for the deputy to massacre him, as well as others of whom\r\nthey have a list.\"[1445] Two days afterwards the Abbé Grégoire tells\r\nthe National Assembly that not a day passes without ecclesiastics being\r\ninsulted in Paris, and pursued with \"horrible threats.\" Malouet is\r\nadvised that \"as soon as guns are distributed among the militia, the\r\nfirst use made of them will be to get rid of those deputies who are bad\r\ncitizens,\" and among others of the Abbé Maury. \"The moment I stepped out\r\ninto the streets,\" writes Mounier, \"I was publicly followed. It was a\r\ncrime to be seen in my company. Wherever I happened to go, along\r\nwith two or three of my companions, it was stated that an assembly of\r\naristocrats was forming. I had become such an object of terror that they\r\nthreatened to set fire to a country-house where I had passed twenty-four\r\nhours; and, to relieve their minds, a promise had to be given that\r\nneither myself nor my friends should be again received into it.\" In one\r\nweek five or six hundred deputies have their passports[1446] made out,\r\nand hold themselves ready to depart. During the following month one\r\nhundred and twenty give in their resignations, or no longer appear\r\nin the Assembly. Mounier, Lally-Tollendal, the Bishop of Langres, and\r\nothers besides, quit Paris, and afterwards France. Mallet du Pan writes,\r\n\"Opinion now dictates its judgment with steel in hand. Believe or die is\r\nthe anathema which vehement spirits pronounce, and this in the name\r\nof Liberty. Moderation has become a crime.\" After the 7th of October,\r\nMirabeau says to the Comte de la Marck:\r\n\r\n\"If you have any influence with the King or the Queen, persuade them\r\nthat they and France are lost if the royal family does not leave Paris.\r\nI am busy with a plan for getting them away.\"\r\n\r\nHe prefers everything to the present situation, \"even civil war;\"\r\nfor \"war, at least, invigorates the soul,\" while here, \"under the\r\ndictatorship of demagogues, we are being drowned in slime.\" Given up\r\nto itself, Paris, in three months, \"will certainly be a hospital, and,\r\nperhaps, a theater of horrors.\" Against the rabble and its leaders, it\r\nis essential that the King should at once coalesce \"with his people,\"\r\nthat he should go to Rouen, appeal to the provinces, provide a Centre\r\nfor public opinion, and, if necessary, resort to armed resistance.\r\nMalouet, on his side, declares that \"the Revolution, since the 5th of\r\nOctober, \"horrifies all sensible men, and every party, but that it\r\nis complete and irresistible.\" Thus the three best minds that are\r\nassociated with the Revolution--those whose verified prophecies attest\r\ngenius or good sense; the only ones who, for two or three years, and\r\nfrom week to week, have always predicted wisely, and who have employed\r\nreason in their demonstrations--these three, Mallet du Pan, Mirabeau,\r\nMabuet, agree in their estimate of the event, and in measuring its\r\nconsequences. The nation is gliding down a declivity, and no one\r\npossesses the means or the force to arrest it. The King cannot do it:\r\n\"undecided and weak beyond all expression, his character resembles those\r\noiled ivory balls which one vainly strives to keep together.\"[1447] And\r\nas for the Assembly, blinded, violated, and impelled on by the theory\r\nit proclaims, and by the faction which supports it, each of its grand\r\ndecrees only renders its fall the more precipitate.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1401: Bailly, \"Mémoires,\" II. 195, 242.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1402: Elysée Loustalot, journalist, editor of the paper\r\n\"Révolutions de Paris,\" was a young lawyer who had shown a natural\r\ngenius for innovative journalism.

THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, AND THE RESULT OF ITS LABORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.--CONDITIONS REQUIRED FOR THE FRAMING OF GOOD LAWS.\r\n\r\nAmong the most difficult undertakings in this world is the formulation\r\nof a national constitution, especially if this is to be a complete and\r\ncomprehensive work. To replace the old structures inside which a great\r\npeople has lived by a new, different, appropriate and durable set of\r\nlaws, to apply a mold of one hundred thousand compartments on to the\r\nlife of twenty-six million people, to construct it so harmoniously,\r\nadapt it so well, so closely, with such an exact appreciation of their\r\nneeds and their faculties, that they enter it of themselves and move\r\nabout it without collisions, and that their spontaneous activity\r\nshould at once find the ease of familiar routine,--is an extraordinary\r\nundertaking and probably beyond the powers of the human mind. In any\r\nevent, the mind requires all its powers to carry the undertaking out,\r\nand it cannot protect itself carefully enough against all sources of\r\ndisturbance and error. An Assembly, especially a Constituent Assembly,\r\nrequires, outwardly, security and independence, inwardly, silence\r\nand order, and generally, calmness, good sense, practical ability and\r\ndiscipline under competent and recognized leaders. Do we find anything\r\nof all this in the Constituent Assembly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--These conditions absent in the Assembly\r\n\r\n     Causes of disorder and irrationality--The place of meeting\r\n     --The large number of deputies--Interference of the galleries\r\n     --Rules of procedure wanting, defective, or disregarded.--The\r\n     parliamentary leaders--Susceptibility and over-excitement of\r\n     the Assembly--Its paroxysms of enthusiasm.--Its tendency to\r\n     emotion.--It encourages theatrical display--Changes which\r\n     these displays introduce in its good intentions.\r\n\r\nWe have only to look at it outwardly to have some doubts about it. At\r\nVersailles, and then at Paris, the sessions are held in an immense hall\r\ncapable of seating 2,000 persons, in which the most powerful voice must\r\nbe strained in order to be heard. It is not calculated for the moderate\r\ntone suitable for the discussion of business; the speaker is obliged to\r\nshout, and the strain on the voice communicates itself to the mind; the\r\nplace itself suggests declamation; and this all the more readily because\r\nthe assemblage consists of 1,200, that is to say, a crowd, and almost\r\na mob. 'At the present day (1877), in our assemblies of five or six\r\nhundred deputies, there are constant interruptions and an incessant\r\nbuzz; there is nothing so rare as self-control, and the firm resolve to\r\ngive an hour's attention to a discourse opposed to the opinions of the\r\nhearers.--What can be done here to compel silence and patience? Arthur\r\nYoung on different occasions sees \"a hundred members on the floor at\r\nonce,\" shouting and gesticulating. \"Gentlemen, you are killing me!\" says\r\nBailly, one day, sinking with exhaustion. Another president exclaims in\r\ndespair, \"Two hundred speaking at the same time cannot be heard; will\r\nyou make it impossible then to restore order in the Assembly?\" The\r\nrumbling, discordant din is further increased by the uproar of the\r\ngalleries.[2101]\r\n\r\n\"In the British Parliament,\" writes Mallet du Pan, \"I saw the\r\ngalleries cleared in a trice because the Duchess of Gordon happened\r\nunintentionally to laugh too loud.\"\r\n\r\nHere, the thronging crowd of spectators, stringers, delegates from the\r\nPalais-Royal, soldiers disguised as citizens, and prostitutes collected\r\nand marshaled, applaud, clap their hands, stamp and hoot, at their\r\npleasure. This is carried to so great an extent that M. de\r\nMontlosier ironically proposes \"to give the galleries a voice in\r\nthe deliberations.\"[2102] Another member wishes to know whether the\r\nrepresentatives are so many actors, whom the nation sends there to\r\nendure the hisses of the Paris public. Interruptions, in fact, take\r\nplace as in a theater, and, frequently, if the members do not give\r\nsatisfaction, they are forced to desist. On the other hand, the deputies\r\nwho are popular with this energetic audience, on which they keep and\r\neye, are actors before the footlights: they involuntarily yield to its\r\ninfluence, and exaggerate their ideas as well as their words to be in\r\nunison with it. Tumult and violence, under such circumstances, become\r\na matter of course, and the chances of an Assembly acting wisely are\r\ndiminished by one-half; on becoming a club of agitators, it ceases to be\r\na conclave of legislators.\r\n\r\nLet us enter and see how this one proceeds. Thus encumbered, thus\r\nsurrounded and agitated, does it take at least those precautions without\r\nwhich no assembly of men can govern itself. When several hundred persons\r\nassemble together for deliberation, it is evident that some sort of an\r\ninternal police is necessary; first of all, some code of accepted usage,\r\nsome written precedents, by which its acts may be prepared and defined,\r\nconsidered in detail, and properly passed. The best of these codes it\r\nready to hand: at the request of Mirabeau, Romilly has sent over the\r\nstanding orders of the English House of Commons.[2103] But with the\r\npresumption of novices, they pay no attention to this code; they imagine\r\nit is needless for them; they will borrow nothing from foreigners; they\r\naccord no authority to experience, and, not content with rejecting the\r\nforms it prescribes, \"it is with difficulty they can be made to follow\r\nany rule whatever.\" They leave the field open to the impulsiveness of\r\nindividuals; any kind of influence, even that of a deputy, even of one\r\nelected by themselves, is suspected by them; hence their choice of a\r\nnew president every fortnight.--They submit to no constraint or control,\r\nneither to the legal authority of a parliamentary code, nor to the moral\r\nauthority of parliamentary chiefs. They are without any such; they are\r\nnot organized in parties; neither on one side nor on the other is a\r\nrecognized leader found who fixes the time, arranges the debate, draws\r\nup the motion, assigns parts, and gives the rein to or restrains\r\nhis supporters. Mirabeau is the only one capable of obtaining this\r\nascendancy; but, on the opening of the Assembly, he is discredited by\r\nthe notoriety of his vices, and, towards the last, is compromised by his\r\nconnections with the Court. No other is of sufficient eminence to have\r\nany influence; there is too much of average and too little of superior\r\ntalent.--Their self-esteem is, moreover, as yet too strong to allow any\r\nconcessions. Each of these improvised legislators has come satisfied\r\nwith his own system, and to submit to a leader to whom he would entrust\r\nhis political conscience, to make of him what three out of four of these\r\ndeputies should be, a voting machine, would require an apprehension of\r\ndanger, some painful experience, an enforced surrender which he is far\r\nfrom realizing.[2104] For this reason, save in the violent party, each\r\nacts as his own chief, according to the impulse of the moment, and the\r\nconfusion may be imagined. Strangers who witness it, lift their hands in\r\npity and astonishment. \"They discuss nothing in their Assembly,\"\r\nwrites Gouverneur Morris,[2105] \"One large half of the time is spent\r\nin hallowing and bawling.... Each Man permitted to speak delivers the\r\nResult of his Lubrications,\" amidst this noise, taking his turn as\r\ninscribed, without replying to his predecessor, or being replied to by\r\nhis successor, without ever meeting argument by argument; so that while\r\nthe firing is interminable, \"all their shots are fired in the air.\"\r\nBefore this \"frightful clatter\" can be reported, the papers of the day\r\nare obliged to make all sorts of excisions, to prune away \"nonsense,\"\r\nand reduce the \"inflated and bombastic style.\" Chatter and clamor, that\r\nis the whole substance of most of these famous sittings.\r\n\r\n\"You would hear,\" says a journalist, \"more yells than speeches; the\r\nsittings seemed more likely to end in fights than in decrees... . Twenty\r\ntimes I said to myself, on leaving, that if anything could arrest and\r\nturn the tide of the Revolution, it would be a picture of these meetings\r\ntraced without caution or adaptation... All my efforts were therefore\r\ndirected to represent the truth, without rendering it repulsive. Out\r\nof what had been merely a row, I concocted a scene... I gave all the\r\nsentiments, but not always in the same words. I translated their yells\r\ninto words, their furious gestures into attitudes, and when I could not\r\ninspire esteem, I endeavored to rouse the emotions.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no remedy for this evil; for, besides the absence of\r\ndiscipline, there is an inward and fundamental cause for the disorder.\r\nThese people are too susceptible. They are Frenchmen, and Frenchmen\r\nof the eighteenth century; brought up in the amenities of the utmost\r\nrefinement, accustomed to deferential manners, to constant kind\r\nattentions and mutual obligations, so thoroughly imbued with the\r\ninstinct of good breeding that their conversation seems almost insipid\r\nto strangers.[2106]--And suddenly they find themselves on the thorny\r\nsoil of politics, exposed to insulting debates, flat contradictions,\r\nvenomous denunciation, constant detraction and open invective; engaged\r\nin a battle in which every species of weapon peculiar to a parliamentary\r\nlife is employed, and in which the hardiest veterans are scarcely able\r\nto keep cool. Judge of the effect of all this on inexperienced, highly\r\nstrung nerves, on men of the world accustomed to the accommodations\r\nand amiabilities of universal urbanity. They are at once beside\r\nthemselves.--And all the more so because they never anticipated a\r\nbattle; but, on the contrary, a festival, a grand and charming idyll, in\r\nwhich everybody, hand in hand, would assemble in tears around the throne\r\nand save the country amid mutual embraces. Necker himself arranges, like\r\na theater, the chamber in which the sessions of the Assembly are to\r\nbe held.[2107] \"He was not disposed to regard the Assemblies of the\r\nStates-General as anything but a peaceful, imposing, solemn, august\r\nspectacle, which the people would enjoy;\" and when the idyll suddenly\r\nchanges into a drama, he is so frightened that it seems to him as if a\r\nlandslide had occurred that threatened, during the night, to break\r\ndown the framework of the building.--At the time of the meeting of the\r\nStates-General, everybody is delighted; all imagine that they are about\r\nto enter the promised land. During the procession of the 4th of May,\r\n\r\n\"tears of joy,\" says the Marquis de Ferrières, \"filled my eyes... . In a\r\nstate of sweet rapture I beheld France supported by Religion\" exhorting\r\nus all to concord. \"The sacred ceremonies, the music, the incense, the\r\npriests in their sacrificial robes, that dais, that orb radiant with\r\nprecious stones. .. I called to my mind the words of the prophet... . My\r\nGod, my country, and my countrymen, all were one with myself!\"\r\n\r\nSuch emotions repeatedly explode in the course of the session, and\r\nresulted in the passage of laws which no one could have imagined.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes,\"[2108] writes the American ambassador, \"a speaker gets up\r\nin the midst of a deliberation, makes a fine discourse on a different\r\nsubject, and closes with a nice little resolution which is carried with\r\na hurrah. Thus, in considering the plan of a national bank proposed by\r\nM. Necker, one of them took it into his head to move that every member\r\nshould give his silver buckles, which was agreed to at once, and the\r\nhonorable mover laid his upon the table, after which the business went\r\non again.\"\r\n\r\nThus, over-excited, they do not know in the morning what they will do\r\nin the afternoon, and they are at the mercy of every surprise. When they\r\nare seized with these fits of enthusiasm, infatuation spreads over all\r\nthe benches; prudence gives way, all foresight disappears and every\r\nobjection is stifled. During the night of the 4th of August,[2109]\r\n\"nobody is master of himself. The Assembly presents the spectacle of an\r\ninebriated crowd in a shop of valuable furniture, breaking and smashing\r\nat will whatever they can lay their hands on.\"\r\n\r\n\"That which would have required a year of care and reflection,\" says\r\na competent foreigner, \"was proposed, deliberated over, and passed by\r\ngeneral acclamation. The abolition of feudal rights, of titles, of the\r\nprivileges of the provinces, three articles which alone embraced a whole\r\nsystem of jurisprudence and statesmanship, were decided with ten or\r\ntwelve other measures in less time than is required in the English\r\nParliament for the first reading of an important bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such are our Frenchmen,\" says Mirabeau again, \"they spend a month in\r\ndisputes about syllables, and overthrow, in a single night, the whole\r\nestablished system of the Monarchy!\"[2110]\r\n\r\nThe truth is, they display the nervousness of women, and, from one end\r\nof the Revolution to the other, this excitability keeps on increasing.\r\n\r\nNot only are they excited, but the pitch of excitement must be\r\nmaintained, and, like the drunkard who, once stimulated, has recourse\r\nagain to strong waters, one would say that they carefully try to expel\r\nthe last remnants of calmness and common sense from their brains. They\r\ndelight in pompous phrases, in high-sounding rhetoric, in declamatory\r\nsentimental strokes of eloquence: this is the style of nearly all their\r\nspeeches, and so strong is their taste, they are not satisfied with\r\nthe orations made amongst themselves. Lally and Necker, having made\r\n\"affecting and sublime\" speeches at the Hôtel-de-Ville, the Assembly\r\nwish them to be repeated before them:[2111] this being the heart of\r\nFrance, it is proper for it to answer to the noble emotions of all\r\nFrenchmen. Let this heart throb on, and as strongly as possible, for\r\nthat is its office, and day by day it receives fresh impulses. Almost\r\nall sittings begin with the reading of flattering addresses or of\r\nthreatening denunciations. The petitioners frequently appear in person,\r\nand read their enthusiastic effusions, their imperious advice, their\r\ndoctrines of dissolution. To-day it is Danton, in the name of Paris,\r\nwith his bull visage and his voice that seems a tocsin of insurrection;\r\nto-morrow, the vanquishers of the Bastille, or some other troop, with a\r\nband of music which continues playing even into the hall. The meeting is\r\nnot a conference for business, but a patriotic opera, where the eclogue,\r\nthe melodrama, and sometimes the masquerade, mingle with the cheers and\r\nthe clapping of hands.[2112]--A serf of the Jura is brought to the\r\nbar of the Assembly aged one hundred and twenty years, and one of the\r\nmembers of the cortège, \"M. Bourbon de la Crosnière, director of a\r\npatriotic school, asks permission to take charge of an honorable old\r\nman, that he may be waited on by the young people of all ranks, and\r\nespecially by the children of those whose fathers were killed in the\r\nattack on the Bastille.\" [2113] Great is the hubbub and excitement. The\r\nscene seems to be in imitation of Berquin,[2114] with the additional\r\ncomplication of a mercenary consideration.\r\n\r\nBut small matters are not closely looked into, and the Assembly, under\r\nthe pressure of the galleries, stoops to shows, such as are held\r\nat fairs. Sixty vagabonds who are paid twelve francs a head, in the\r\ncostumes of Spaniards, Dutchmen, Turks, Arabs, Tripolitans, Persians,\r\nHindus, Mongols, and Chinese, conducted by the Prussian Anacharsis\r\nClootz, enter, under the title of Ambassadors of the Human Race, to\r\ndeclaim against tyrants, and they are admitted to the honors of the\r\nsitting. On this occasion the masquerade is a stroke devised to hasten\r\nand extort the abolition of nobility.[2115] At other times, there is\r\nlittle or no object in it; its ridiculousness is inexpressible, for the\r\nfarce is played out as seriously and earnestly as in a village award\r\nof prizes. For three days, the children who have taken their first\r\ncommunion before the constitutional bishop have been promenaded through\r\nthe streets of Paris; at the Jacobin club they recite the nonsense they\r\nhave committed to memory; and, on the fourth day, admitted to the bar\r\nof the Assembly, their spokesman, a poor little thing of twelve years,\r\nrepeats the parrot-like tirade. He winds up with the accustomed oath,\r\nupon which all the others cry out in their piping, shrill voices, \"We\r\nswear!\" As a climax, the President, Trejlhard, a sober lawyer, replies\r\nto the little gamins with perfect gravity in a similar strain, employing\r\nmetaphors, personifications, and everything else belonging to the\r\nstock-in-trade of a pedant on his platform:\r\n\r\n\"You merit a share in the glory of the founders of liberty, prepared as\r\nyou are to shed your blood in her behalf.\"\r\n\r\nImmense applause from the \"left\" and the galleries, and a decree\r\nordering the speeches of both president and children to be printed. The\r\nchildren, probably, would rather have gone out to play; but, willingly\r\nor unwillingly, they receive or endure the honors of the sitting.[2116]\r\n\r\nSuch are the tricks of the stage and of the platform by which the\r\nmanagers here move their political puppets. Emotional susceptibility,\r\nonce recognized as a legitimate force, thus becomes an instrument\r\nof intrigue and constraint. The Assembly, having accepted theatrical\r\nexhibitions when these were sincere and earnest, is obliged to tolerate\r\nthem when they become mere sham and buffoonery. At this vast national\r\nbanquet, over which it meant to preside, and to which, throwing the\r\ndoors wide open, it invited all France, its first intoxication was\r\ndue to wine of a noble quality; but it has touched glasses with the\r\npopulace, and by degrees, under the pressure of its associates, it has\r\ndescended to adulterated and burning drinks, to a grotesque unwholesome\r\ninebriety which is all the more grotesque and unwholesome, because it\r\npersists in believing itself to be reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--Inadequacy of its information.\r\n\r\n     Its composition--The social standing and culture of the\r\n     larger number--Their incapacity. Their presumption\r\n     --Fruitless advice of competent men.--Deductive politics\r\n     --Parties--The minority; its faults--The majority; its\r\n     dogmatism.\r\n\r\nIf reason could only resume its empire during the lucid intervals!\r\nBut reason must exist before it can govern, and in no French Assembly,\r\nexcept the two following this, have there ever been fewer political\r\nintellects.--Strictly speaking, with careful search, there could\r\nundoubtedly be found in France, in 1789, five or six hundred experienced\r\nmen, such as the intendants and military commanders of every province;\r\nnext to these the prelates, administrators of large dioceses the members\r\nof the local \"parlements,\" whose courts gave them influence, and who,\r\nbesides judicial functions, possessed a portion of administrative power;\r\nand finally, the principal members of the Provincial Assemblies, all of\r\nthem influential and sensible people who had exercised control over\r\nmen and affairs, at once humane, liberal, moderate, and capable of\r\nunderstanding the difficulty, as well as the necessity, of a great\r\nreform; indeed, their correspondence, full of facts, stated with\r\nprecision and judgment, when compared with the doctrinaire rubbish of\r\nthe Assembly, presents the strongest possible contrast.--But most of\r\nthese lights remain under a bushel; only a few of them get into the\r\nAssembly; these burn without illuminating, and are soon extinguished in\r\nthe tempest.' I. The venerable Machault is not there, nor Malesherbes;\r\nthere are none of the old ministers or the marshals of France. Not one\r\nof the intendants is there, except Malouet, and by the superiority of\r\nthis man, the most judicious of the Assembly, one can judge the services\r\nwhich his colleagues would have rendered. Out of two hundred and\r\nninety-one members of the clergy,[2117] there are indeed forty-eight\r\nbishops or archbishops and thirty-five abbots or canons, but, being\r\nprelates and with large endowments, they excite the envy of their order,\r\nand are generals without any soldiers. We have the same spectacle among\r\nthe nobles. Most of them, the gentry of the provinces, have been elected\r\nin opposition to the grandees of the Court. Moreover, neither the\r\ngrandees of the Court, devoted to worldly pursuits, nor the gentry of\r\nthe provinces, confined to private life, are practically familiar with\r\npublic affairs. A small group among them, twenty-eight magistrates\r\nand about thirty superior officials who have held command or have been\r\nconnected with the administration, probably have some idea of the peril\r\nof society; but it is precisely for this reason that they seem to be\r\nbehind the age and remain without influence.--In the Third-Estate, out\r\nof five hundred and seventy-seven members, only ten have exercised\r\nany important functions, those of intendant, councillor of state,\r\nreceiver-general, lieutenant of police, director of the mint, and others\r\nof the same category. The great majority is composed of unknown lawyers\r\nand people occupying inferior positions in the profession, notaries,\r\nroyal attorneys, register commissaries, judges and assessors of;\r\nthe présidial, bailiffs and lieutenants of the bailiwick, simple\r\npractitioners confined from their youth to the narrow circle of an\r\ninferior jurisdiction or to a routine of scribbling, with no escape\r\nbut philosophical excursions in imaginary space under the guidance of\r\nRousseau and Raynal. There are three hundred and seventy-three of this\r\nclass, to whom may be added thirty-eight farmers and husbandmen, fifteen\r\nphysicians, and, among the manufacturers, merchants, and capitalists,\r\nsome fifty or sixty who are their equals in education and in political\r\ncapacity. Scarcely one hundred and fifty proprietors are here from the\r\nmiddle class.[2118] To these four hundred and fifty deputies, whose\r\ncondition, education, instruction, and mental range qualified them for\r\nbeing good clerks, prominent men in a commune, honorable fathers of a\r\nfamily, or, at best, provincial academicians, add two hundred and eight\r\ncurés, their equals; this makes six hundred and fifty out of eleven\r\nhundred and eighteen deputies, forming a positive majority, which,\r\nagain, is augmented by about fifty philosophical nobles, leaving out the\r\nweak who follow the current, and the ambitious who range themselves on\r\nthe strong side.--We may divine what a chamber thus made up can do, and\r\nthose who are familiar with such matters prophesy what it will do.[2119]\r\n\r\n\"There are some able men in the National Assembly,\" writes the American\r\nminister, \"yet the best heads among them would not be injured by\r\nexperience, and, unfortunately, there are great numbers who, with much\r\nimagination, have little knowledge, judgment, or reflection.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be just as sensible to select eleven hundred notables from an\r\ninland province and entrust them to the repair of an old frigate. They\r\nwould conscientiously break the vessel up, and the frigate they would\r\nconstruct in its place would founder before it left port.\r\n\r\nIf they would only consult the pilots and professional\r\nshipbuilders!--There are several of such to be found around them, whom\r\nthey cannot suspect, for most of them are foreigners, born in free\r\ncountries, impartial, sympathetic, and, what is more, unanimous. The\r\nMinister of the United States writes, two months before the convocation\r\nof the States-General:[2120]\r\n\r\n\"I, a republican, and just, as it were, emerged from that Assembly which\r\nhas formed one of the most republican of republican constitutions,--I\r\npreach incessantly respect for the prince, attention to the rights of\r\nthe nobility, and moderation, not only in the object, but also in the\r\npursuit of it.\"\r\n\r\nJefferson, a democrat and radical, expresses himself no differently. At\r\nthe time of the oath of the Tennis Court, he redoubles his efforts to\r\ninduce Lafayette and other patriots to make some arrangement with the\r\nKing to secure freedom of the press, religious, liberty, trial by jury,\r\nthe habeas corpus, and a national legislature,--things which he could\r\ncertainly be made to adopt,--and then to retire into private life, and\r\nlet these institutions act upon the condition of the people until they\r\nhad rendered it capable of further progress, with the assurance that\r\nthere would be no lack of opportunity for them to obtain still more.\r\n\r\n\"This was all,\" he continues, \"that I thought your countrymen able to\r\nbear soberly and usefully.\"\r\n\r\nArthur Young, who studies the moral life of France so conscientiously,\r\nand who is so severe in depicting old abuses, cannot comprehend the\r\nconduct of the Commons.\r\n\r\n\"To set aside practice for theory... in establishing the interests of a\r\ngreat kingdom, in securing freedom to 25,000,000 of people, seems to me\r\nthe very acme of imprudence, the very quintessence of insanity.\"\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, now that the Assembly is all-powerful, it is to be hoped\r\nthat it will be reasonable:\r\n\r\n\"I will not allow myself to believe for a moment that the\r\nrepresentatives of the people can ever so far forget their duty to\r\nthe French nation, to humanity, and their own fame, as to suffer\r\nany inordinate and impracticable views--any visionary or theoretic\r\nsystems--... to turn aside their exertions from that security which is\r\nin their hands, to place on the chance and hazard of public commotion\r\nand civil war the invaluable blessings which are certainly in their\r\npower. I will not conceive it possible that men who have eternal fame\r\nwithin their grasp will place the rich inheritance on the cast of a die,\r\nand, losing the venture, be damned among the worst and most profligate\r\nadventurers that ever disgraced humanity.\"\r\n\r\nAs their plan becomes more definite the remonstrances become more\r\ndecided, and all the expert judges point out to them the importance of\r\nthe wheels which they are willfully breaking.\r\n\r\n\"As they have[2121] hitherto felt severely the authority exercised over\r\nthem in the name of their princes, every limitation of that authority\r\nseems to them desirable. Never having felt the evils of too weak an\r\nexecutive, the disorders to be apprehended from anarchy make as yet no\r\nimpression\"--\"They want an American Constitution,[2122] but with a\r\nKing instead of a President, without reflecting they have no American\r\ncitizens to support that Constitution... If they have the good sense\r\nto give the nobles, as nobles, some portion of the national power, this\r\nfree constitution will probably last, But otherwise it will degenerate\r\neither into a pure monarchy, or a vast republic, or a democracy. Will\r\nthe latter last? I doubt it. I am sure that it will not, unless the\r\nwhole nation is changed.\"\r\n\r\nA little later, when they renounce a parliamentary monarchy to put in\r\nits place \"a royal democracy,\" it is at once explained to them that such\r\nan institution applied to France can produce nothing but anarchy, and\r\nfinally end in despotism.\r\n\r\n\"Nowhere[2123] has liberty proved to be stable without a sacrifice of\r\nits excesses, without some barrier to its own omnipotence... . Under\r\nthis miserable government... the people, soon weary of storms, and\r\nabandoned without legal protection to their seducers or to their\r\noppressors, will shatter the helm, or hand it over to some audacious\r\nhand that stands ready to seize it.\"\r\n\r\nEvents occur from month to month in fulfillment of these predictions,\r\nand the predictions grow gloomier and more gloomy. It is a flock of wild\r\nbirds:[2124]\r\n\r\n\"It is very difficult to guess whereabouts the flock will settle when\r\nit flies so wild... . This unhappy country, bewildered in the pursuit\r\nof metaphysical whims, presents to our moral view a mighty ruin. The\r\nAssembly, at once master and slave, new in power, wild in theory, raw in\r\npractice, engrossing all functions without being able to exercise any,\r\nhas freed that fierce, ferocious people from every restraint of religion\r\nand respect... . Such a state of things cannot last... The glorious\r\nopportunity is lost and for this time, at least, the Revolution has\r\nfailed.\"\r\n\r\nWe see, from the replies of Washington, that he is of the same opinion.\r\nOn the other side of the Channel, Pitt, the ablest practician, and\r\nBurke, the ablest theorist, of political liberty, express the same\r\njudgment. Pitt, after 1789, declares that the French have overleaped\r\nfreedom. After 1790, Burke, in a work which is a prophecy as well as a\r\nmasterpiece, points to military dictatorship as the termination of the\r\nRevolution, \"the most completely arbitrary power that has ever appeared\r\non earth.\" Nothing is of any effect. With the exception of the small\r\npowerless group around Malouet and Mounier, the warnings of Morris,\r\nJefferson, Romilly, Dumont, Mallet du Pan, Arthur Young, Pitt and Burke,\r\nall of them men who have experience of free institutions, are received\r\nwith indifference or repelled with disdain. Not only are our new\r\npoliticians incapable, but they think themselves the contrary, and their\r\nincompetence is aggravated by their infatuation.\r\n\r\n\"I often used to say, \"writes Dumont,[2125] \"that if a hundred persons\r\nwere stopped at haphazard in the streets of London, and a hundred in the\r\nstreets of Paris, and a proposal were made to them to take charge of the\r\nGovernment, ninety-nine would accept it in Paris and ninety-nine would\r\nrefuse it in London... The Frenchman thinks that all difficulties can\r\nbe overcome by a little quickness of wit. Mirabeau accepted the post of\r\nreporter to the Committee on Mines without having the slightest tincture\r\nof knowledge on the subject.\"\r\n\r\nIn short, most of them enter politics \"like the gentleman who, on being\r\nasked if he knew how to play on the harpsichord, replied, 'I cannot\r\ntell, I never tried, but I will see.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The Assembly had so high an opinion of itself, especially the left side\r\nof it, that it would willingly have undertaken the framing of the Code\r\nof Laws for all nations... Never has so many men been seen together,\r\nfancying that they were all legislators, and that they were there to\r\ncorrect all the errors of the past, to remedy all mistakes of the human\r\nmind, and ensure the happiness of all ages to come. Doubt had no\r\nplace in their minds, and infallibility always presided over their\r\ncontradictory decrees.\"--\r\n\r\nThis is because they have a theory and because, according to their\r\nnotion, this theory renders special knowledge unnecessary. Herein they\r\nare thoroughly sincere, and it is of set purpose that they reverse all\r\nordinary modes of procedure. Up to this time a constitution used to be\r\norganized or repaired like a ship. Experiments were made from time to\r\ntime, or a model was taken from vessels in the neighborhood; the first\r\naim was to make the ship sail; its construction was subordinated to its\r\nwork; it was fashioned in this or that way according to the materials on\r\nhand; a beginning was made by examining these materials, and trying to\r\nestimate their rigidity, weight, and strength.--All this is reactionary;\r\nthe age of Reason has come and the Assembly is too enlightened to drag\r\non in a rut. In conformity with the fashion of the time it works by\r\ndeduction, after the method of Rousseau, according to an abstract notion\r\nof right, of the State and of the social compact.[2126] According to\r\nthis process, by virtue of political geometry alone, they shall have the\r\nperfect vessel and since it perfect it follows that it will sail, and\r\nthat much better than any empirical craft.--They legislate according\r\nto this principle, and one may imagine the nature of their discussions.\r\nThere are no convincing facts, no pointed arguments; nobody would\r\never imagine that the speakers were gathered together to conduct real\r\nbusiness. Through speech after speech, strings of hollow abstractions\r\nare endlessly renewed as in a meeting of students in rhetoric for the\r\npurpose of practice, or in a society of old bookworms for their own\r\namusement. On the question of the veto \"each orator in turn, armed with\r\nhis portfolio, reads a dissertation which has no bearing whatever\" on\r\nthe preceding one, which makes a \"sort of academical session,\"[2127]\r\na succession of pamphlets fresh every morning for several days. On the\r\nquestion of the Rights of Man fifty-four speakers are placed on the\r\nlist.\r\n\r\n\"I remember,\" says Dumont, \"that long discussion, which lasted for\r\nweeks, as a period of deadly boredom,--vain disputes over words, a\r\nmetaphysical jumble, and most tedious babble; the Assembly was turned\r\ninto a Sorbonne lecture-room,\" and all this while chateaux were burning,\r\nwhile town-halls were being sacked, and courts dared no longer hold\r\nassize, while the distribution of wheat was stopped, and while society\r\nwas in course of dissolution. In the same manner the theologians of the\r\nEaster Roman Empire kept up their wrangles about the uncreated light of\r\nMount Tabor while Mahomet II was battering the walls of Constantinople\r\nwith his cannon.--Ours, of course, are another sort of men, juvenile\r\nin feeling, sincere, enthusiastic, even generous, and further, more\r\ndevoted, laborious, and in some cases endowed with rare talent. But\r\nneither zeal, nor labor, nor talent are of any use when not employed in\r\nthe service of a sound idea; and if in the service of a false one, the\r\ngreater they are the more mischief they do.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the year 1789, there can be not doubt of this;\r\nand the parties now formed reveal their presumption, improvidence,\r\nincapacity, and obstinacy. \"This Assembly,\" writes the American\r\nambassador,[2128] \"may be divided into three parties;--\r\n\r\none called the aristocrats, consists of the high clergy, the\r\nparliamentary judges, and such of the nobility as think they ought to\r\nform a separate order.\" This is the party which offers resistance to\r\nfollies and errors, but with follies and errors almost equally great.\r\nIn the beginning \"the prelates,[2129] instead of conciliating the curés,\r\nkept them at a humiliating distance, affecting distinctions, exacting\r\nrespect,\" and, in their own chamber, \"ranging themselves apart on\r\nseparate benches.\" The nobles, on the other hand, the more to alienate\r\nthe commons, began by charging these with, \"revolt, treachery, and\r\ntreason,\" and by demanding the use of military force against them. Now\r\nthat the victorious Third-Estate has again overcome them and overwhelms\r\nthem with numbers, they become still more maladroit, and conduct the\r\ndefense much less efficiently than the attack. \"In the Assembly,\" says\r\none of them, \"they do not listen, but laugh and talk aloud;\" they\r\ntake pains to embitter their adversaries and the galleries by their\r\nimpertinence. \"They leave the chamber when the President puts the\r\nquestion and invite the deputies of their party to follow them, or\r\ncry out to them not to take part in the deliberation: through this\r\ndesertion, the clubbists become the majority, and decree whatever they\r\nplease.\" It is in this way that the appointment of judges and bishops\r\nis withdrawn from the King and assigned to the people. Again, after the\r\nreturn from Varennes, when the Assembly finds out that the result of its\r\nlabors is impracticable and wants to make it less democratic, the whole\r\nof the right side refuses to share in the debates, and, what is worse,\r\nvotes with the revolutionaries to exclude the members of the Constituent\r\nfrom the Legislative Assembly. Thus, not only does it abandon its\r\nown cause, but it commits self-destruction, and its desertion ends in\r\nsuicide.--\r\n\r\nA second party remains, \"the middle party,\"[2130] which consists of\r\nwell-intentioned people from every class, sincere partisans of a good\r\ngovernment; but, unfortunately, they have acquired their ideas of\r\ngovernment from books, and are admirable on paper. But as it happens\r\nthat the men who live in the world are very different from imaginary men\r\nwho dwell in the heads of philosophers, it is not to be wondered at if\r\nthe systems taken out of books are fit for nothing but to be upset by\r\nanother book. Intellects of this stamp are the natural prey of utopians.\r\nLacking the ballast of experience they are carried away by pure logic\r\nand serve to enlarge the flock of theorists.--The latter form the third\r\nparty, which is called the \"enragés (the wild men), and who, at the\r\nexpiration of six months, find themselves \"the most numerous of all.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is composed,\" says Morris, \"of that class which in America is known\r\nby the name of pettifogging lawyers, together with a host of curates and\r\nmany of those persons who in all revolutions throng to the standard\r\nof change because they are not well.[2131] This last party is in close\r\nalliance with the populace and derives from this circumstance very great\r\nauthority.\"\r\n\r\nAll powerful passions are on its side, not merely the irritation of the\r\npeople tormented by misery and suspicion, not merely the ambition and\r\nself-esteem of the bourgeois, in revolt against the ancient régime,\r\nbut also the inveterate bitterness and fixed ideas of so many suffering\r\nminds and so many factious intellects, Protestants, Jansenists,\r\neconomists, philosophers, men who, like Fréteau, Rabout-Saint-Etienne,\r\nVolney, Sieyès, are hatching out a long arrears of resentments or hopes,\r\nand who only await the opportunity to impose their system with all the\r\nintolerance of dogmatism and of faith. To minds of this stamp the past\r\nis a dead letter; example is no authority; realities are of no account;\r\nthey live in their own Utopia. Sieyès, the most important of them all,\r\njudges that \"the whole English constitution is charlatanism, designed\r\nfor imposing on the people;\"[2132] he regards the English \"as children\r\nin the matter of a constitution,\" and thinks that he is capable of\r\ngiving France a much better one. Dumont, who sees the first committees\r\nat the houses of Brissot and Clavières, goes away with as much anxiety\r\nas \"disgust.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible,\" he says, \"to depict the confusion of ideas, the\r\nlicense of the imagination, the burlesque of popular notions. One\r\nwould think that they saw before them the world on the day after the\r\nCreation.\"\r\n\r\nThey seem to think, indeed, that human society does not exist, and that\r\nthey are appointed to create it. Just as well might ambassadors \"of\r\nhostile tribes, and of diverse interests, set themselves to arrange\r\ntheir common lot as if nothing had previously existed.\" There is no\r\nhesitation. They are satisfied that the thing can be easily done, and\r\nthat, with two or three axioms of political philosophy, the first man\r\nthat comes may make himself master of it. Immoderate conceit of this\r\nkind among men of experience would seem ridiculous; in this assembly of\r\nnovices it is a strength. A flock which has lost its way follows those\r\nwho appears to forge ahead; they are the most irrational but they\r\nare the most confident, and in the Chamber as in the nation it is the\r\ndaredevils who become leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--The Power Of Simple, General Ideas.\r\n\r\n     Ascendancy of the revolutionary party--Theory in its favor--\r\n     The constraint thus imposed on men's minds--Appeal to the\r\n     passions--Brute force on the side of the party--It profits\r\n     by this--Oppression of the minority.\r\n\r\nTwo advantages give this party the ascendancy, and these advantages are\r\nof such importance that henceforth whoever possesses them is sure of\r\nbeing master.--In the first place the prevailing theory is on the\r\nside of the revolutionaries, and they alone are, in the second place,\r\ndetermined thoroughly to apply it. This party, therefore, is the only\r\none which is consistent and popular in the face of adversaries who are\r\nunpopular and inconsequent. Nearly all of the latter, indeed, defenders\r\nof the ancient régime, or partisans of a limited monarchy, are likewise\r\nimbued with abstract principles and philosophical speculation. The most\r\nrefractory nobles have advocated the rights of man in their memorials.\r\nMounier, the principal opponent of the demagogues, was the\r\nleader of the commons when they proclaimed themselves to be the\r\nNational--Assembly.[2133] This is enough: they have entered the narrow\r\ndefile which leads to the abyss. They had no idea of it at the first\r\nstart, but one step leads to another, and, willing or unwilling, they\r\nmarch on, or are pushed on. When the abyss comes in sight it is too\r\nlate; they have been driven there by the logical results of their own\r\nconcessions; they can do nothing but wax eloquent and indignant;\r\nhaving abandoned their vantage ground, they find no halting-place\r\nremaining.--There is an enormous power in general ideas, especially\r\nif they are simple, and appeal to the passions. None are simpler than\r\nthese, since they are reducible to the axiom which assumes the rights\r\nof man, and subordinate to them every institution, old or new. None are\r\nbetter calculated to inflame the sentiments, since the doctrine enlists\r\nhuman arrogance and pride in its service, and, in the name of justice,\r\nconsecrates all the demands of independence and domination. Consider\r\nthree-fourths of the deputies, immature and prejudiced, possessing no\r\ninformation but a few formulas of the current philosophy, with no thread\r\nto guide them but pure logic, abandoned to the declamation of lawyers,\r\nto the wild utterances of the newspapers, to the promptings of\r\nself-esteem, to the hundred thousand tongues which, on all sides, at the\r\nbar of the Assembly, at the tribune, in the clubs, in the streets, in\r\ntheir own breasts, repeat unanimously to them, and every day, the same\r\nflattery:\r\n\r\n\"You are sovereign and omnipotent. Right is vested in you alone. The\r\nKing exists only to execute your will. Every order, every corporation,\r\nevery power, every civil or ecclesiastical association is illegitimate\r\nand null the moment you declare it to be so. You may even transform\r\nreligion. You are the fathers of the country. You have saved France, you\r\nwill regenerate humanity. The whole world looks on you in admiration;\r\nfinish your glorious work--forward, always forward.\"\r\n\r\nSuperior good sense and rooted convictions could alone stand firm\r\nagainst this flood of seductions and solicitations; but vacillating and\r\nordinary men are carried away by it. In the harmony of applause which\r\nrises, they do not hear the crash of the ruins they produce. In any\r\ncase, they stop their ears, and shun the cries of the oppressed; they\r\nrefuse to admit that their work could possibly bring about evil results;\r\nthey accept the sophisms and untruths which justify it; they allow the\r\nassassinated to be calumniated in order to excuse the assassins; they\r\nlisten to Merlin de Douay, who, after three or four jacqueries, when\r\npillaging, arson, and murder are going on in all the provinces, has just\r\ndeclared in the name of the Committee on Feudalism[2134] that \"a law\r\nmust be presented to the people, the justice of which may enforce\r\nsilence on the feudatory egoists who, for the past six months, so\r\nindecently protest against plunder; the wisdom of which may restore to\r\na sense of duty the peasant who has been led astray for a moment by\r\nhis resentment of a long oppression.\" And when Raynal, the surviving\r\npatriarch of the philosophic party, one day, for a wonder, takes\r\nthe plain truth with him into their tribune, they resent his\r\nstraightforwardness as an outrage, and excuse it solely on the ground of\r\nhis imbecility. An omnipotent legislator cannot depreciate himself; like\r\na king he is condemned to self-admiration in his public capacity. \"There\r\nwere not thirty deputies amongst us,\" says a witness, \"who thought\r\ndifferently from Raynal,\" but \"in each other's presence the credit of\r\nthe Revolution, the perspective of its blessings, was an article of\r\nfaith which had to be believed in;\" and, against their own reason,\r\nagainst their conscience, the moderates, caught in the net of their own\r\nacts, join the revolutionaries to complete the Revolution.\r\n\r\nHad they refused, they would have been compelled; for, to obtain the\r\npower, the Assembly has, from the very first, either tolerated\r\nor solicited the violence of the streets. But, in accepting\r\ninsurrectionists for its allies, it makes them masters, and henceforth,\r\nin Paris as in the provinces, illegal and brutal force becomes the\r\nprincipal power of the State. \"The triumph was accomplished through the\r\npeople; it was impossible to be severe with them;\"[2135] hence, when\r\ninsurrections were to be put down, the Assembly had neither the courage\r\nnor the force necessary. \"They blame for the sake of decency; they frame\r\ntheir deeds by expediency.\" and in turn justly undergo the pressure\r\nwhich they themselves have sanctioned against others. Only three or four\r\ntimes do the majority, when the insurrection becomes too daring--after\r\nthe murder of the baker François, the insurrection of the Swiss Guard at\r\nNancy, and the outbreak of the Champ de Mars--feel that they themselves\r\nare menaced, vote for and apply martial law, and repel force with force.\r\nBut, in general, when the despotism of the people is exercised only\r\nagainst the royalist minority, they allow their adversaries to be\r\noppressed, and do not consider themselves affected by the violence which\r\nassails the party of the \"right:\" they are enemies, and may be given\r\nup to the wild beasts. In accordance with this, the \"left\" has made its\r\narrangements; its fanaticism has no scruples; it is principle, it is\r\nabsolute truth that is at stake; this must triumph at any cost. Besides,\r\ncan there be any hesitation in having recourse to the people in the\r\npeople's own cause? A little compulsion will help along the good cause,\r\nand hence the siege of the Assembly is continually renewed. This was the\r\npractice already at Versailles before the 6th of October, while now, at\r\nParis, it is kept up more actively and with less disguise.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year 1790,[2136] the band under pay comprises\r\nseven hundred and fifty effective men, most of them deserters or\r\nsoldiers drummed out of their regiments, who are at first paid five\r\nfrancs and then forty sous a day. It is their business to make or\r\nsupport motions in the coffee-houses and in the streets, to mix with\r\nthe spectators at the sittings of the sections, with the groups at the\r\nPalais-Royal, and especially in the galleries of the National-Assembly,\r\nwhere they are to hoot or applaud at a given signal. Their leader is a\r\nChevalier de Saint-Louis, to whom they swear obedience, and who receives\r\nhis orders from the Committee of Jacobins. His first lieutenant at the\r\nAssembly is a M. Saule, \"a stout, small, stunted old fellow, formerly an\r\nupholsterer, then a charlatan hawker of four penny boxes of grease (made\r\nfrom the fat of those that had been hung--for the cure of diseases of\r\nthe kidneys) and all his life a sot.... who, by means of a tolerably\r\nshrill voice, which was always well moistened, has acquired some\r\nreputation in the galleries of the Assembly.\" In fact, he has forged\r\nadmission tickets he has been turned out; he has been obliged to resume\r\n\"the box of ointment, and travel for one or two months in the provinces\r\nwith a man of letters for his companion.\" But on his return, \"through\r\nthe protection of a groom of the Court, he obtained a piece of ground\r\nfor a coffee-house against the wall of the Tuileries garden, almost\r\nalongside of the National Assembly,\" and now it is at home in his\r\ncoffee-shop behind his counter that the hirelings of the galleries \"come\r\nto him to know what they must say, and to be told the order of the day\r\nin regard to applause.\" Besides this, he is there himself; \"it is he\r\nwho for three years is to regulate public sentiment in the galleries\r\nconfided to his care, and, for his useful and satisfactory services,\r\nthe Constituent Assembly will award him a recompense,\" to which the\r\nLegislative Assembly will add \"a pension of six hundred livres, besides\r\na lodging in an apartment of the Feuillants.\"\r\n\r\nWe can divine how men of this stamp, thus compensated, do their work.\r\nFrom the top of the galleries[2137] they drown the demands of the\r\n\"right\" by the force of their lungs; this or that decree, as, for\r\ninstance, the abolition of titles of nobility, is carried, \"not by\r\nshouts, but by terrific howls.\"[2138] On the arrival of the news of the\r\nsacking of the Hôtel de Castries by the populace, they applaud. On the\r\nquestion coming up as to the decision whether the Catholic faith shall\r\nbe dominant, \"they shout out that the aristocrats must all be hung, and\r\nthen things will go on well.\" Their outrages not only remain unpunished,\r\nbut are encouraged: this or that noble who complains of their hooting\r\nis called to order, while their interference and vociferations, their\r\ninsults and their menaces, are from this time introduced as one of the\r\nregular wheels of legislative operations. Their pressure is still worse\r\noutside the Chamber.[2139] The Assembly is obliged several times to\r\ndouble its guard. On the 27th of September, 1790, there are 40,000\r\nmen around the building to extort the dismissal of the Ministers, and\r\n\"motions for assassination\" are made under the windows, On the 4th of\r\nJanuary, 1791, whilst on a call of the house the ecclesiastical deputies\r\npass in turn to the tribune, to take or refuse the oath to the civil\r\nconstitution of the clergy, a furious clamor ascends in the Tuileries,\r\nand even penetrates into the Chamber. \"To the lamp post with all those\r\nwho refuse!\" On the 27th of September, 1790, M. Dupont, economist,\r\nhaving spoken against the assignats, is surrounded on leaving the\r\nChamber and hooted at, hustled, pushed against the basin of the\r\nTuileries, into which he was being thrown when the guard rescued him. On\r\nthe 21st of June, 1790, M. de Cazalès just misses \"being torn to pieces\r\nby the people.\"[2140] Deputies of the \"right\" are threatened over and\r\nover again by gestures in the streets and in the coffee-houses; effigies\r\nof them with ropes about the neck are publicly displayed. The Abbé Maury\r\nis several times on the point of being hung: he saves himself once by\r\npresenting a pistol. Another time the Vicomte de Mirabeau is obliged\r\nto draw his sword. M. de Clermont-Tonnerre, having voted against the\r\nannexation of the Comtat to France, is assailed with chairs and clubs\r\nin the Palais-Royal, pursued into a porter's room and from thence to his\r\ndwelling; the howling crowd break in the doors, and are only repelled\r\nwith great difficulty. It is impossible for the members of the \"right\"\r\nto assemble together; they are \"stoned\" in the church of the Capuchins,\r\nthen in the Salon Français in the Rue Royale, and then, to crown the\r\nwhole, an ordinance of the new judges shuts up their hall, and punishes\r\nthem for the violence which they have to suffer.[2141] In short they are\r\nat the mercy of the mob. The most moderate, the most liberal, and the\r\nmost manly both in heart and head, Malouet, declares that \"in going to\r\nthe Assembly he rarely forgot to carry his pistols with him.\"[2142]\r\n\"For two years,\" he says, \"after the King's flight, we never enjoyed one\r\nmoment of freedom and security.\"\r\n\r\n\" On going into a slaughter-house,\" writes another deputy, \"you see some\r\nanimals at the entrance which still have a short time to live, until\r\nthe hour comes to dispatch them. Such was the impression which the\r\nassemblage of nobles, bishops, and parliamentarians[2143] on the right\r\nside made on my mind every time I entered the Assembly, the executioners\r\nof the left side permitting them to breathe a little longer.\"\r\n\r\nThey are insulted and outraged even upon their benches; \"placed\r\nbetween peril within and peril without, between the hostility of the\r\ngalleries,\"[2144] and that of the howlers at the entrance, \"between\r\npersonal insults and the abbey of Saint-Germain, between shouts of\r\nlaughter celebrating the burning of their chateaux and the clamors\r\nwhich, thirty times in a quarter of an hour, cry down their opinions,\"\r\nthey are given over and denounced \"to the ten thousand Cerberuses\" of\r\nthe journals and of the streets, who pursue them with their yells and\r\n\"cover them with their slaver.\" Any expedient is good enough for putting\r\ndown their opposition, and, at the end of the session, in full Assembly,\r\nthey are threatened with \"a recommendation to the departments,\" which\r\nmeans the excitement of riots and of the permanent jacquerie of the\r\nprovinces against them in their own houses.--Parliamentary strategy\r\nof this sort, employed uninterruptedly for twenty-nine months, finally\r\nproduces its effect. Many of the weak are gained over;[2145] even on\r\ncharacters of firm temper fear has a hold; he who would march under fire\r\nwith head erect shuddered at the idea of being dragged in the gutter by\r\nthe rabble; the brutality of the populace always exercises a material\r\nascendancy over finely strung nerves. On the 12th of July, 1791,[2146]\r\nthe call of the house decreed against the absentees proves that one\r\nhundred and thirty-two deputies no longer appear in their places. Eleven\r\ndays before, among those who take no further part in the proceedings.\r\nThus, before the completion of the Constitution, the whole of the\r\nopposition, more than four hundred members, over one-third of the\r\nAssembly, is reduced to flight or to silence. By dint of oppression, the\r\nrevolutionary party has got rid of all resistance, while the violence\r\nwhich gave to it ascendancy in the streets, now gives to it equal\r\nascendance within the walls of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--Refusal to supply the ministry\r\n\r\n     Effects of this mistake--Misconception of the situation--The\r\n     committee of investigation--Constant alarms--Effects of\r\n     ignorance and fear on the work of the Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\nGenerally in an omnipotent assembly, when a party takes the lead and\r\nforms a majority, it furnishes the Ministry; and this fact suffices\r\nto give, or to bring back to it, some glimpse of common sense. For its\r\nleaders, with the Government in their own hands, become responsible for\r\nit, and when they propose or pass a law, they are obliged to anticipate\r\nits effect. Rarely will a Secretary of War or of the Navy adopt a\r\nmilitary code which goes to establish permanent disobedience in the\r\narmy or in the navy. Rarely will a Secretary of the Treasury propose an\r\nexpenditure for which there is not a sufficient revenue, or a system of\r\ntaxation that provides no returns. Placed where full information can\r\nbe procured, daily advised of every details, surrounded by skillful\r\ncounselors and expert clerks, the chiefs of the majority, who thus\r\nbecome heads of the administration, immediately drop theory for\r\npractice; and the fumes of political speculation must be pretty dense\r\nin their minds if they exclude the multiplied rays of light which\r\nexperience constantly sheds upon them. Let the most stubborn of\r\ntheorists take his stand at the helm of a ship, and, whatever be the\r\nobstinacy of his principles or his prejudices, he will never, unless he\r\nis blind or led by the blind, persist in steering always to the right\r\nor always to the left. Just so after the flight to Varennes, when the\r\nAssembly, in full possession of the executive power, directly controls\r\nthe Ministry, it comes to recognize for itself that its constitutional\r\nmachine will not work, except in the way of destruction; and it is the\r\nprincipal revolutionaries, Barnave, Duport, the Lameths, Chapelier, and\r\nThouret,[2147] who undertake to make alterations in the mechanisms so\r\nas to lessen its friction. But this source of knowledge and reason,\r\nhowever, to which they are momentarily induced to draw, in spite of\r\nthemselves and too late, has been turned off by themselves from the very\r\nbeginning. On the 6th of November, 1789, in deference to principle\r\nand in dread of corruption, the Assembly had declared that none of\r\nits members should hold ministerial office. We see it in consequence\r\ndeprived of all the instruction which comes from direct contact with\r\naffairs, surrendered without any counterpoise to the seductions\r\nof theory, reduced by its own decision to become a mere academy of\r\nlegislation only.\r\n\r\nNay, still worse, through another effect of the same error, it condemns\r\nitself by its own act to constant fits of panic. For, having allowed\r\nthe power which it was not willing to assume to slip into indifferent or\r\nsuspect hands, it is always uneasy, and all its decrees bear an uniform\r\nstamp, not only of the willful ignorance within which it confines\r\nitself, but also of the exaggerated or chimerical fears in which its\r\nlife is passed.--Imagine a ship conveying a company of lawyers, literary\r\nmen, and other passengers, who, supported by a mutinous and poorly fed\r\ncrew, take full command, but refuse to select one of their own number\r\nfor a pilot or for the officer of the watch. The former captain\r\ncontinues to nominate them; through very shame, and because he is a\r\ngood sort of man, his title is left to him, and he is retained for the\r\ntransmission of orders. If these orders are absurd, so much the worse\r\nfor him; if he resists them, a fresh mutiny forces him to yield; and\r\neven when they cannot be executed, he has to answer for their being\r\ncarried out. In the meantime, in a room between decks, far away from the\r\nhelm and the compass, our club of amateurs discuss the equilibrium of\r\nfloating bodies, decree a new system of navigation, have the ballast\r\nthrown overboard, crowd on all sail, and are astonished to find that\r\nthe ship heels over on its side. The officer of the watch and the pilot\r\nmust, evidently, have managed the maneuver badly. They are accordingly\r\ndismissed and others put in their place, while the ship heels over\r\nfarther yet and begins to leak in every joint. Enough: it is the\r\nfault of the captain and the old staff of officers, They are not\r\nwell-disposed; for a beautiful system of navigation like this ought to\r\nwork well; and if it fails to do so, it is because some one interferes\r\nwith it. It is positively certain that some of those people belonging\r\nto the former régime must be traitors, who would rather have the ship\r\ngo down than submit; they are public enemies and monsters. They must\r\nbe seized, disarmed, put under surveillance, and punished.--Such is the\r\nreasoning of the Assembly. Evidently, to reassure it, a message from the\r\nMinister of the Interior chosen by the Assembly, to the lieutenant of\r\npolice whom he had appointed, to come to his office every morning, would\r\nbe all that was necessary. But it is deprived of this simple resource by\r\nits own act, and has no other expedient than to appoint a committee of\r\ninvestigation to discover crimes of \"treason against the nation.\"[2148]\r\nWhat could be more vague than such a term? What could be more\r\nmischievous than such an institution?--Renewed every month, deprived of\r\nspecial agents, composed of credulous and inexperienced deputies, this\r\ncommittee, set to perform the work of a Lenoir or a Fouché, makes up for\r\nits incapacity by violence, and its proceedings anticipate those of\r\nthe Jacobine inquisition.[2149] Alarmist and suspicious, it encourages\r\naccusations, and, for lack of plots to discover, it invents them.\r\nInclinations, in its eyes, stand for actions, and floating projects\r\nbecome accomplished outrages. On the denunciation of a domestic who has\r\nlistened at a door, on the gossip of a washerwoman who has found a scrap\r\nof paper in a dressing-gown, on the false interpretation of a letter,\r\non vague indications which it completes and patches together by\r\nthe strength of its imagination, it forges a coup d'état, makes\r\nexaminations, domiciliary visits, nocturnal surprises and arrests;[2150]\r\nit exaggerates, blackens, and comes in public session to denounce the\r\nwhole affair to the National Assembly. First comes the plot of the\r\nBreton nobles to deliver Brest to the English;[2151] then the plot for\r\nhiring brigands to destroy the crops; then the plot of 14th of July to\r\nburn Paris; then the plot of Favras to murder Lafayette, Necker, and\r\nBailly; then the plot of Augeard to carry off the King, and many others,\r\nweek after week, not counting those which swarm in the brains of the\r\njournalists, and which Desmoulins, Fréron, and Marat reveal with a\r\nflourish of trumpets in each of their publications.\r\n\r\n\"All these alarms are cried daily in the streets like cabbages\r\nand turnips, the good people of Paris inhaling them along with the\r\npestilential vapors of our mud.\"[2152]\r\n\r\n..............Now, in this aspect, as well as in a good many others, the\r\nAssembly is the people; satisfied that it is in danger,[2153] it makes\r\nlaws as the former make their insurrections, and protects itself by\r\nstrokes of legislation as the former protects itself by blows with\r\npikes. Failing to take hold of the motor spring by which it might direct\r\nthe government machine, it distrusts all the old and all the new wheels.\r\nThe old ones seem to it an obstacle, and, instead of utilizing them,\r\nit breaks them one by one--parliaments, provincial states, religious\r\norders, the church, the nobles, and royalty. The new ones are\r\nsuspicious, and instead of harmonizing them, it puts them out of gear\r\nin advance--the executive power, administrative powers, judicial\r\npowers, the police, the gendarmerie, and the army.[2154] Thanks to\r\nthese precautions it is impossible for any of them to be turned against\r\nitself; but, also, thanks to these precautions, none of them can perform\r\ntheir functions.[2155]\r\n\r\nIn building, as well as in destroying, the Assembly had two bad\r\ncounselors, on the one hand fear, on the other hand theory; and on the\r\nruins of the old machine which it had demolished without discernment,\r\nthe new machine, which it has constructed without forecast, will work\r\nonly to its own ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2101: Arthur Young, June 15, 1789.--Bailly, passim,--Moniteur,\r\nIV. 522 (June 2, 1790).--Mercure de France (Feb. 11 1792).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2102: Moniteur, v. 631 (Sep. 12, 1790), and September 8th\r\n(what is said by the Abbé Maury).--Marmontel, book XIII. 237.--Malouet,\r\nI. 261.--Bailly, I. 227.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2103: Sir Samuel Romilly, \"Mémoires,\" I. 102, 354.--Dumont,\r\n158.

DESTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--Two principal vices of the ancient régime.\r\n\r\n     Two principal reforms proposed by the King and the\r\n     privileged classes.--They suffice for actual needs.--\r\n     Impracticable if carried further.\r\n\r\nIn the structure of the old society there were two fundamental vices\r\nwhich called for two reforms of corresponding importance.[2201]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, those who were privileged having ceased to render\r\nthe services for which the advantages they enjoyed constituted their\r\ncompensation and their privileges were no longer anything but a\r\ngratuitous charge imposed on one portion of the nation for the benefit\r\nof the other. Hence the necessity for suppressing them.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the Government, being absolute, made use of public\r\nresources as if they were its own private property, arbitrarily and\r\nwastefully;[2202] it was therefore necessary to impose upon it some\r\neffective and regular restraints.\r\n\r\nTo render all citizens equal before taxation, to put the purse of the\r\ntax-payers into the hands of their representatives, such was the twofold\r\noperation to be carried out in 1789; and the privileged class as well\r\nas the King willingly lent themselves to it. Not only, in this respect,\r\nwere the memorials of nobles and clergy in perfect harmony, but the\r\nmonarch himself; in his declaration of the 23rd of June, 1789, decreed\r\nthe two articles. Henceforth, every tax or loan was to obtain the\r\nconsent of the States-General; this consent was to be renewed at each\r\nnew meeting of the States; the public estimates were to be annually\r\npublished, discussed, specified, apportioned, voted on and verified by\r\nthe States; there were to be no arbitrary assessments or use of public\r\nfunds; allowances were to be specially assigned for all separate\r\nservices, the household of the King included. In each province or\r\ndistrict-general, there was to be an elected Provincial Assembly,\r\none-half composed of ecclesiastics and nobles, and the other half of\r\nmembers of the Third-Estate, to apportion general taxes, to manage local\r\naffairs, to decree and direct public works, to administer hospitals,\r\nprisons, workhouses, and to continue its function, in the interval of\r\nthe sessions, through an intermediary commission chosen by itself; so\r\nthat, besides the principal control of the center, there were to be\r\nthirty subordinate controlling powers at the extremities. There was\r\nto be no more exemption or distinction in the matter of taxation; the\r\nroadtax (covée) was to be abolished, also the right of franc-fief[2203]\r\nimposed on plebeians; the rights of mortmain,[2204] subject to\r\nindemnity, and internal customs duties. There was to be a reduction of\r\nthe captaincies, a modification of the salt-tax and of the excise,\r\nthe transformation of civil justice, too costly for the poor, and of\r\ncriminal justice, too severe for the humbler classes. Here we have,\r\nbesides the principal reform, equalization of taxes; the beginning and\r\ninducement of the more complete operation which is to strike off the\r\nlast of the feudal manacles. Moreover; six weeks later, on the 4th of\r\nAugust; the privileged, in an outburst of generosity, come forward\r\nof their own accord to cut off or undo the whole of them. This double\r\nreform thus encountered no obstacles, and, as Arthur Young reported to\r\nhis friends, it merely required one vote to have it adopted.[2205]\r\n\r\nThis was enough; for all real necessities were now satisfied. On the one\r\nhand, through the abolition of privileges in the matter of taxation,\r\nthe burden of the peasant and, in general, on the small tax-payer\r\nwas diminished one-half, and perhaps two thirds; instead of paying\r\nfifty-three francs on one hundred francs of net income, he paid no more\r\nthan twenty-five or even sixteen;[2206] an enormous relief, and one\r\nwhich, with the proposed revision of the excise and salt duties, made a\r\ncomplete change in his condition. Add to this the gradual redemption\r\nof ecclesiastical and feudal dues: and after twenty years the peasant,\r\nalready proprietor of a fifth of the soil, would, without the violent\r\nevents of the Revolution, in any case have attained the same degree of\r\nindependence and well-being which he was to achieve by passing through\r\nit. On the other hand, through the annual vote on the taxes, not only\r\nwere waste and arbitrariness in the employment of the public funds put\r\na stop to, but also the foundations of the parliamentary system of\r\ngovernment were laid: whoever holds the purse-strings is, or becomes,\r\nmaster of the rest; henceforth in the maintenance or establishment of\r\nany service, the assent of the States was to be necessary. Now, in the\r\nthree Chambers which the three orders were thenceforward to form, there\r\nwere two in which the plebeians predominated. Public opinion, moreover,\r\nwas on their side, while the King, the true constitutional monarch, far\r\nfrom possessing the imperious inflexibility of a despot, did not now\r\npossess the initiative of an ordinary person. Thus the preponderance\r\nfell to the communes, and they could legally, without any collision,\r\nexecute multiply, and complete, with the aid of the prince and through\r\nhim, all useful reforms.[2207]--This was enough; for human society,\r\nlike a living body, is seized with convulsions when it is subjected to\r\noperations on too great a scale, and these, although restricted, were\r\nprobably all that France in 1789 could endure. To equitably reorganize\r\nafresh the whole system of direct and indirect taxation; to revise,\r\nrecast, and transfer to the frontiers the customs-tariffs; to suppress,\r\nthrough negotiations and with indemnity, feudal and ecclesiastical\r\nclaims, was an operation of the greatest magnitude, and as complex as\r\nit was delicate. Things could be satisfactorily arranged only through\r\nminute inquiries, verified calculations, prolonged essays, and mutual\r\nconcessions. In England, in our day, a quarter of a century has been\r\nrequired to bring about a lesser reform, the transformation of tithes\r\nand manorial-rights; and time likewise was necessary for our Assemblies\r\nto perfect their political education,[2208] to get of their theories, to\r\nlearn, by contact with practical business, and in the study of details,\r\nthe distance which separates speculation from practice; to discover that\r\na new system of institutions works well only through a new system of\r\nhabits, and that to decree a new system of habits is tantamount to\r\nattempting to build an old house.--Such, however, is the work they\r\nundertake. They reject the King's proposals, the limited reforms, the\r\ngradual transformations. According to them, it is their right and their\r\nduty to re-make society from top to bottom. Such is the command of pure\r\nreason, which has discovered the Rights of Man and the conditions of the\r\nSocial Contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII--Nature of societies, and the principle of enduring constitutions.\r\n\r\nApply the Social Contract, if you like, but apply it only to those for\r\nwhom it was drawn up. These were abstract beings, belonging neither to\r\na period nor to a country, perfect creatures hatched out under the\r\nmagic wand of a metaphysician. They had as a matter of fact come into\r\nexistence by removing all the characteristics which distinguish one man\r\nfrom another,[2209] a Frenchman from a Papuan, a modern Englishman from\r\na Briton in the time of Caesar, and by retaining only the part which is\r\ncommon to all.[2210] The essence thus obtained is a prodigiously meager\r\none, an infinitely curtailed extract of human nature, that is, in the\r\nphraseology of the day,\r\n\r\n\"A BEING WITH A DESIRE TO BE HAPPY AND THE FACULTY OF REASONING,\"\r\n\r\nnothing more and nothing else. After this pattern several million\r\nindividuals, all precisely alike, have been prepared while, through a\r\nsecond simplification, as extraordinary as the first one, they are all\r\nsupposed to be free and all equal, without a past, without kindred,\r\nwithout responsibility, without traditions, without customs, like so\r\nmany mathematical units, all separable and all equivalent, and then it\r\nis imagined that, assembled together for the first time, these proceed\r\nto make their primitive bargain. From the nature they are supposed to\r\npossess and the situation in which they are placed, no difficulty is\r\nfound in deducing their interests, their wills, and the contract between\r\nthem. But if this contract suits them, it does not follow that it suits\r\nothers. On the contrary, if follows that is does not suit others; the\r\ninconvenience becomes extreme on its being imposed on a living society;\r\nthe measure of that inconvenience will be the immensity of the distance\r\nwhich divides a hollow abstraction, a philosophical phantom, an empty\r\ninsubstantial image from the real and complete man.\r\n\r\nIn any event we are not here considering a specimen, so reduced and\r\nmutilated as to be only an outline of a human being; no, we are to the\r\ncontrary considering Frenchmen of the year 1789. It is for them alone\r\nthat the constitution is being made: it is therefore they alone who\r\nshould be considered; they are manifestly men of a particular species,\r\nhaving their peculiar temperament, their special aptitudes, their own\r\ninclinations, their religion, their history, all adding up into a mental\r\nand moral structure, hereditary and deeply rooted, bequeathed to them by\r\nthe indigenous stock, and to which every great event, each political\r\nor literary phase for twenty centuries, has added a growth, a\r\ntransformation or a custom. It is like some tree of a unique species\r\nwhose trunk, thickened by age, preserves in its annual rings and in its\r\nknots, branches, and curvatures, the deposits which its sap has made\r\nand the imprint of the innumerable seasons through which it has passed.\r\nUsing the philosophic definition, so vague and trite, to such an\r\norganism, is only a puerile label teaching us nothing.--And all the more\r\nbecause extreme diversities and inequalities show themselves on this\r\nexceedingly elaborate and complicated background,--those of age,\r\neducation, faith, class and fortune; and these must be taken into\r\naccount, for these contribute to the formation of interests, passions,\r\nand dispositions. To take only the most important of these, it is clear\r\nthat, according to the average of human life,[2211] one-half of the\r\npopulation is composed of children, and, besides this, one-half of the\r\nadults are women. In every twenty inhabitants eighteen are Catholic,\r\nof whom sixteen are believers, at least through habit and tradition.\r\nTwenty-five out of twenty-six millions of Frenchmen cannot read, one\r\nmillion at the most being able to do so; and in political matters only\r\nfive or six hundred are competent. As to the condition of each class,\r\nits ideas, its sentiments, its kind and degree of culture, we should\r\nhave to devote a large volume to a mere sketch of them.\r\n\r\nThere is still another feature and the most important of all. These men\r\nwho are so different from each other are far from being independent, or\r\nfrom contracting together for the first time. They and their ancestors\r\nfor eight hundred years form a national body, and it is because they\r\nbelong to this body that they live, multiply, labor, make acquisitions,\r\nbecome enlightened and civilized, and accumulate the vast heritage of\r\ncomforts and intelligence which they now enjoy. Each in this community\r\nis like the cell of an organized body; undoubtedly the body is only\r\nan accumulation of cells, but the cell is born, subsists, develops and\r\nattains its individual ends only be the healthy condition of the whole\r\nbody. Its chief interest, accordingly, is the prosperity of the whole\r\norganism, and the fundamental requirement of all the little fragmentary\r\nlives, whether they know it or not, is the conservation of the\r\ngreat total life in which they are comprised as musical notes in a\r\nconcert.--Not only is this a necessity for them, but it is also a duty.\r\nWe are all born with a debt to our country, and this debt increases\r\nwhile we grow up; it is with the assistance of our country, under the\r\nprotection of the law, upheld by the authorities, that our ancestors\r\nand parents have given us life, property, and education. Each person's\r\nfaculties, ideas, attitudes, his or her entire moral and physical being\r\nare the products to which the community has contributed, directly or\r\nindirectly, at least as tutor and guardian. By virtue of this the state\r\nis his creditor, just as a destitute father is of his able-bodied son;\r\nit can lay claim to nourishment, services, and, in all the force or\r\nresources of which he disposes, it deservedly demands a share.--This he\r\nknows and feels, the notion of country is deeply implanted within him,\r\nand when occasion calls for it, it will show itself in ardent emotions,\r\nfueling steady sacrifice and heroic effort.--Such are veritable\r\nFrenchmen, and we at once see how different they are from the simple,\r\nindistinguishable, detached monads which the philosophers insist on\r\nsubstituting for them. Their association need not be created, for it\r\nalready exists; for eight centuries they have a \"common weal\" (la chose\r\npublique). The safety and prosperity of this common weal is at once\r\ntheir interest, their need, their duty, and even their most secret wish.\r\nIf it is possible to speak here of a contract, their quasi-contract is\r\nmade and settled for them beforehand. The first article, at all events,\r\nis stipulated for, and this overrides all the others. The nation must\r\nnot be dissolved. Public authorities must, accordingly, exist, and\r\nthese must be respected. If there are a number of these, they must be\r\nso defined and so balanced as to be of mutual assistance, instead of\r\nneutralizing each other by their opposition. Whatever government is\r\nadopted, it must place matters in the hands best qualified to conduct\r\nthem. The law must not exist for the advantage of the minority, nor for\r\nthat of the majority, but for the entire community.--In regard to this\r\nfirst article no one must derogate from it, neither the minority nor\r\nthe majority, neither the Assembly elected by the nation, nor the nation\r\nitself, even if unanimous. It has no right arbitrarily to dispose of the\r\ncommon weal, to put it in peril according to its caprice, to subordinate\r\nit to the application of a theory or to the interest of a single class,\r\neven if this class is the most numerous. For, that which is the common\r\nweal does not belong to it, but to the whole community, past, present,\r\nand to come. Each generation is simply the temporary manager and\r\nresponsible trustee of a precious and glorious patrimony which it has\r\nreceived from the former generation, and which it has to transmit to\r\nthe one that comes after it. In this perpetual endowment, to which all\r\nFrenchmen from the first days of France have brought their offerings,\r\nthere is no doubt about the intentions of countless benefactors; they\r\nhave made their gifts conditionally, that is, on the condition that the\r\nendowment should remain intact, and that each successive beneficiary\r\nshould merely serve as the administrator of it. Should any of the\r\nbeneficiaries, through presumption or levity, through rashness or\r\none-sidedness, compromise the charge entrusted to them, they wrong\r\nall their predecessors whose sacrifices they invalidate, and all their\r\nsuccessors whose hopes they frustrate. Accordingly, before undertaking\r\nto frame a constitution, let the whole community be considered in its\r\nentirety, not merely in the present but in the future, as far as the\r\neye can reach. The interest of the public, viewed in this far-sighted\r\nmanner, is the end to which all the rest must be subordinate, and for\r\nwhich a constitution provides. A constitution, whether oligarchic,\r\nmonarchist, or aristocratic, is simply an instrument, good if it attains\r\nthis end, and bad if it does not attain it, and which, to attain it,\r\nmust, like every species of mechanism, vary according to the ground,\r\nmaterials, and circumstances. The most ingenious is illegitimate if it\r\ndissolves the State, while the clumsiest is legitimate if it keeps the\r\nState intact. There is none that springs out of an anterior, universal,\r\nand absolute right. According to the people, the epoch, and the degree\r\nof civilization, according to the outer or inner condition of things,\r\nall civil or political equality or inequality may, in turn, be or cease\r\nto be beneficial or hurtful, and therefore justify the legislator in\r\nremoving or preserving it. It is according to this superior and salutary\r\nlaw, and not according to an imaginary and impossible contract, that he\r\nis to organize, limit, delegate and distribute from the center to\r\nthe extremities, through inheritance or through election, through\r\nequalization or through privilege, the rights of the citizen and the\r\npower of the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--The estates of a society.\r\n\r\n     Political aptitude of the aristocracy.--Its disposition in\r\n     1789.--Special services which it might have rendered.--The\r\n     principle of the Assembly as to original equality.\r\n     --Rejection of an Upper Chamber.--The feudal rights of the\r\n     aristocracy.--How far and why they were worthy of respect.\r\n     --How they should have been transformed.--Principle of the\r\n     Assembly as to original liberty.--Distinction established by\r\n     it in feudal dues; application of its principle.--The\r\n     lacunae of its law.--Difficulties of redemption.--Actual\r\n     abolition of all feudal liens.--Abolition of titles and\r\n     territorial names.--Growing prejudice against the\r\n     aristocracy.--Its persecutions.--The emigration.\r\n\r\nWas it necessary to begin by making a clean sweep, and was it advisable\r\nto abolish or only to reform the various orders and corporations?--Two\r\nprominent orders, the clergy and the nobles, enlarged by the ennobled\r\nplebeians who had grown wealthy and acquired titled estates, formed a\r\nprivileged aristocracy side by side with the Government, whose favors it\r\nmight receive on the condition of seeking them assiduously and with\r\ndue acknowledgment, privileged on its own domains, and taking advantage\r\nthere of all rights belonging to the feudal chieftain without performing\r\nhis duties. This abuse was evidently an enormous one and had to\r\nbe ended. But, it did not follow that, because the position of the\r\nprivileged class on their domains and in connection with the Government\r\nwas open to abuse, they should be deprived of protection for person and\r\nproperty on their domains, and of influence and occupation under the\r\nGovernment.--A favored aristocracy, when it is unoccupied and renders\r\nnone of the services which its rank admits of, when it monopolizes all\r\nhonors, offices, promotions, preferences, and pensions,[2212] to the\r\ndetriment of others not less needy and deserving, is undoubtedly a\r\nserious evil. But when an aristocracy is subject to the common law, when\r\nit is occupied, especially when its occupation is in conformity with its\r\naptitudes, and more particularly when it is available for the formation\r\nof an upper elective chamber or an hereditary peerage, it is a vast\r\nservice.--In any case it cannot be irreversibly suppressed; for,\r\nalthough it may be abolished by law, it is reconstituted by facts. The\r\nlegislator must necessarily choose between two systems, that which lets\r\nit lie fallow, or that which enables it to be productive, that which\r\ndrives it away from, or that which rallies it round, the public service.\r\nIn every society which has lived for any length of time, a nucleus of\r\nfamilies always exists whose fortunes and importance are of ancient\r\ndate. Even when, as in France in 1789, this class seems to be exclusive,\r\neach half century introduces into it new families; judges, governors,\r\nrich businessmen or bankers who have risen to the tope of the social\r\nladder through the wealth they have acquired or through the important\r\noffices they have filled; and here, in the medium thus constituted, the\r\nstatesman and wise counselor of the people, the independent and able\r\npolitician is most naturally developed.--Because, on the one hand,\r\nthanks to his fortune and his rank, a man of this class is above all\r\nvulgar ambitions and temptations. He is able to serve gratis; he is not\r\nobliged to concern himself about money or about providing for his family\r\nand making his way in the world. A political mission is no interruption\r\nto his career; he is not obliged, like the engineer, merchant, or\r\nphysician, to sacrifice either his business, his advancement, or his\r\nclients. He can resign his post without injury to himself or to\r\nthose dependent on him, follow his own convictions, resist the noisy\r\ndeleterious opinions of the day, and be the loyal servant, not the\r\nlow flatterer of the public. Whilst, consequently, in the inferior or\r\naverage conditions of life, the incentive is self-interest, with him the\r\ngrand motive is pride. Now, amongst the deeper feelings of man there is\r\nnone which is more adapted for transformation into probity, patriotism,\r\nand conscientiousness; for the first requisite of the high-spirited\r\nman is self-respect, and, to obtain that, he is induced to deserve it.\r\nCompare, from this point of view, the gentry and nobility of England\r\nwith the \"politicians\" of the United States.--On the other hand,\r\nwith equal talents, a man who belongs to this sphere of life enjoys\r\nopportunities for acquiring a better comprehension of public affairs\r\nthan a poor man of the lower classes. The information he requires is\r\nnot the erudition obtained in libraries and in private study. He must\r\nbe familiar with living men, and, besides these, with agglomerations\r\nof men, and even more with human organizations, with States, with\r\nGovernments, with parties, with administrative systems, at home and\r\nabroad, in full operation and on the spot. There is but one way to reach\r\nthis end, and that is to see for himself, with his own eyes, at once\r\nin general outline and in details, by intercourse with the heads of\r\ndepartments, with eminent men and specialists, in whom are gathered up\r\nthe information and the ideas of a whole class. Now the young do not\r\nfrequent society of this description, either at home or abroad, except\r\non the condition of possessing a name, family, fortune, education and a\r\nknowledge of social observances. All this is necessary to enable a\r\nyoung man of twenty to find doors everywhere open to him to be received\r\neverywhere on an equal footing, to be able to speak and to write three\r\nor four living languages, to make long, expensive, and instructive\r\nsojourns in foreign lands, to select and vary his position in the\r\ndifferent branches of the public service, without pay or nearly so, and\r\nwith no object in view but that of his political culture Thus brought up\r\na man, even of common capacity, is worthy of being consulted. If he is\r\nof superior ability, and there is employment for him, he may become a\r\nstatesman before thirty; he may acquire ripe capacities, become prime\r\nMinister, the sole pilot, alone able, like Pitt, Canning, or Peel, to\r\nsteer the ship of State between the reefs, or give in the nick of time\r\nthe touch to the helm which will save the ship.--Such is the service to\r\nwhich an upper class is adapted. Only this kind of specialized stud farm\r\ncan furnish a regular supply of racers, and, now and then, the favorite\r\nwinner that distances all his competitors in the European field.\r\n\r\nBut in order that they may prepare and educate themselves for this\r\ncareer, the way must be clear, and they must not be compelled to travel\r\ntoo repulsive a road. If rank, inherited fortune, personal dignity, and\r\nrefined manners are sources of disfavor with the people; if, to obtain\r\ntheir votes, he is forced to treat as equals electoral brokers of low\r\ncharacter; if impudent charlatanism, vulgar declamation, and servile\r\nflattery are the sole means by which votes can be secured, then, as\r\nnowadays in the United States, and formerly in Athens, the aristocratic\r\nbody will retire into private life and soon settle down into a state\r\nof idleness. A man of culture and refinement, born with an income of a\r\nhundred thousand a year, is not tempted to become either manufacturer,\r\nlawyer, or physician. For want of other occupation he loiters about,\r\nentertains his friends, chats, indulges in the tastes and hobbies of an\r\namateur, is bored or enjoys himself. As a result one of society's great\r\nforces is thus lost to the nation. In this way the best and largest\r\nacquisition of the past, the heaviest accumulation of material and\r\nof moral capital, remain unproductive. In a pure democracy the upper\r\nbranches of the social tree, not only the old ones but the young ones,\r\nremain sterile. When a vigorous branch passes above the rest and\r\nreaches the top it ceases to bear fruit. The élite of the nation is thus\r\ncondemned to constant and irremediable failures because it cannot find\r\na suitable outlet for its activity. It wants no other outlet, for in all\r\ndirections its rival, who are born below it, can serve as usefully and\r\nas well as itself. But this one it must have, for on this its aptitudes\r\nare superior, natural, unique, and the State which refuses to employ\r\nit resembles the gardener who in his fondness for a plane surface would\r\nrepress his best shoots.[2213]--Hence, in the constructions which aim to\r\nutilize the permanent forces of society and yet maintain civil equality,\r\nthe aristocracy is brought to take a part in public affairs by the\r\nduration and gratuitous character of its mission, by the institution of\r\nan hereditary character, by the application of various machinery, all\r\nof which is combined so as to develop the ambition, the culture, and\r\nthe political capacity of the upper class, and to place power, or the\r\ncontrol of power, in its hands, on the condition that it shows itself\r\nworthy of exercising it.--Now, in 1789, the upper class was not unworthy\r\nof it. Members of the parliaments, the noblemen, bishops, capitalists,\r\nwere the men amongst whom, and through whom, the philosophy of the\r\neighteenth century was propagated. Never was an aristocracy more\r\nliberal, more humane, and more thoroughly converted to useful\r\nreforms;[2214] many of them remain so under the knife of the guillotine.\r\nThe magistrates of the superior tribunals, in particular, traditionally\r\nand by virtue of their institution, were the enemies of excessive\r\nexpenditure and the critics of arbitrary acts. As to the gentry of the\r\nprovinces, \"they were so weary,\" says one of them,[2215] \"of the Court\r\nand the Ministers that most of them were democrats.\" For many years,\r\nin the Provincial Assemblies, the whole of the upper class, the clergy,\r\nnobles, and Third-Estate, furnishes abundant evidence of its good\r\ndisposition, of its application to business, its capacity and even\r\ngenerosity. Its mode of studying, discussing, and assigning the local\r\ntaxation indicates what it would have done with the general budget had\r\nthis been entrusted to it. It is evident that it would have protected\r\nthe general taxpayer as zealously as the taxpayer of the province,\r\nand kept as close an eye upon the public purse at Paris as on that of\r\nBourges or of Montauban.--Thus were the materials of a good chamber\r\nready at hand, and the only thing that had to be done was to convene\r\nthem. On having the facts presented to them, its members would have\r\npassed without difficulty from a hazardous theory to common-sense\r\npractice, and the aristocracy which had enthusiastically given an\r\nimpetus to reform in its saloons would, in all probability, have carried\r\nit out effectively and with moderation in the Parliament.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, the Assembly is not providing a Constitution for contemporary\r\nFrenchmen, but for abstract beings. Instead of seeing classes in society\r\none placed above the other, it simply sees individuals in juxtaposition;\r\nits attention is not fixed on the advantage of the nation, but on the\r\nimaginary rights of man. As all men are equal, all must have an equal\r\nshare in the government. There must be no orders in a State, no avowed\r\nor concealed political privileges, no constitutional complications or\r\nelectoral combinations by which an aristocracy, however liberal and\r\ncapable, may put its hands upon any portion of the public power.--On\r\nthe contrary, because it was once privileged to enjoy important and\r\nrewarding public employment, the candidacy of the upper classes is now\r\nsuspect. All projects which, directly or indirectly, reserve or provide\r\na place for it, are refused: At first the Royal Declaration, which, in\r\nconformity with historical precedents, maintained the three orders in\r\nthree distinct chambers, and only summoned them to deliberate together\r\n\"on matters of general utility.\" Then the plan of the Constitutional\r\nCommittee, which proposed a second Chamber, appointed for life by the\r\nKing on the nomination of the Provincial Assemblies. And finally the\r\nproject of Mounier who proposed to confide to these same Assemblies the\r\nelection of a Senate for six years, renewed by thirds every two years.\r\nThis Senate was to be composed of men of at least thirty-five years of\r\nage, and with an income in real property of 30,000 livres per annum. The\r\ninstinct of equality is too powerful and a second Chamber is not wanted,\r\neven if accessible to plebeians. Through it,[2216]\r\n\r\n\"The smaller number would control the greater;\"... \"we should fall\r\nback on the humiliating distinctions\" of the ancient regime; \"we should\r\nrevivify the germ of an aristocracy which must be exterminated.\"....\r\n\"Moreover, whatever recalls or revives feudal Institutions is bad, and\r\nan Upper Chamber is one of its remnants.\" ....\"If the English have\r\none, it is because they have been forced to make a compromise with\r\nprejudice.\"\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly, sovereign and philosophic, soars above their\r\nerrors, their trammel; and their example. The depository of truth, it\r\nhas not to receive lessons from others, but to give them, and to offer\r\nto the world's admiration the first type of a Constitution which is\r\nperfect and in conformity with principle, the most effective of any in\r\npreventing the formation of a governing class; in closing the way to\r\npublic business, not only to the old noblesse, but to the aristocracy\r\nof the future; in continuing and exaggerating the work of absolute\r\nmonarchy; in preparing for a community of officials and administrators;\r\nin lowering the level of humanity; in reducing to sloth and brutalizing\r\nor blighting the elite of the families which maintain or raise\r\nthemselves; and in withering the most precious of nurseries, that in\r\nwhich the State recruits its statesmen.[2217]\r\n\r\nExcluded from the Government, the aristocracy is about to retire\r\ninto private life. Let us follow them to their estates: Feudal rights\r\ninstituted for a barbarous State are certainly a great draw-back in a\r\nmodern State. If appropriate in an epoch when property and sovereignty\r\nwere fused together, when the Government was local, when life was\r\nmilitant, they form an incongruity at a time when sovereignty and\r\nproperty are separated, when the Government is centralized, when the\r\nregime is a pacific one. The bondage which, in the tenth century,\r\nwas necessary to re-established security and agriculture, is, in the\r\neighteenth century, purposeless thralldom which impoverishes the soil\r\nand fetters the peasant. But, because these ancient claims are liable\r\nto abuse and injurious at the present day, it does not follow that they\r\nnever were useful and legitimate, nor that it is allowable to abolish\r\nthem without indemnity On the contrary, for many centuries, and, on\r\nthe whole, so long as the lord of the manor resided on his estates this\r\nprimitive contract was advantageous to both parties, and to such an\r\nextent that it has led to the modern contract. Thanks to the pressure of\r\nthis tight bandage, the broken fragments of the community can be\r\nagain united, and society once more recover its solidity, force,\r\nand activity.--In any event, that the institution, like all human\r\ninstitutions, took its rise in violence and was corrupted by abuses is\r\nof little consequence; the State, for eight hundred years, recognized\r\nthese feudal claims, and, with its own consent and the concurrence of\r\nits Courts, they were transmitted, bequeathed, sold, mortgaged, and\r\nexchanged, like any other species of property. Only two or three\r\nhundred, at most, now remained in the families of the original\r\nproprietors. \"The largest portion of the titled estates,\" says a\r\ncontemporary,[2218] \"have become the property of capitalists, merchants,\r\nand their descendants; the fiefs, for the most part, being in the\r\nhands of the bourgeois of the towns.\" All the fiefs which, during two\r\ncenturies past, have been bought by new men, now represent the economy\r\nand labor of their purchasers.--Moreover; whoever the actual holders\r\nmay be, whether old or whether new men, the State is under obligation to\r\nthem, not only by general right--and because, from the beginning, it\r\nis in its nature the guardian of all property,--but also by a special\r\nright, because it has itself sanctioned this particular species of\r\nproperty. The buyers of yesterday paid their money only under its\r\nguarantee; its signature is affixed to the contract, and it has bound\r\nitself to secure to them the enjoyment of it. If it prevents them\r\nfrom doing so, let it make them compensation; in default of the thing\r\npromised to them, it owes them the value of it. Such is the law in cases\r\nof expropriation for public utility; in 1834, for instance, the English,\r\nfor the legal abolition of slavery, paid to their planters the sum of\r\n£20,000,000. --But that is not sufficient: when, in the suppression\r\nof feudal rights, the legislator's thoughts are taken up with the\r\ncreditors, he has only half performed his task; there are two sides to\r\nthe question, and he must likewise think of the debtors. If he is\r\nnot merely a lover of abstractions and of fine phrases, if that which\r\ninterests him is men and not words, if he is bent upon the effective\r\nenfranchisement of the cultivator of the soil, he will not rest content\r\nwith proclaiming a principle, with permitting the redemption of rents,\r\nwith fixing the rate of redemption, and, in case of dispute, with\r\nsending parties before the tribunals. He will reflect that the\r\npeasantry, jointly responsible for the same debt will find difficulty\r\nin agreeing among themselves; that they are afraid of litigation; that,\r\nbeing ignorant, they will not know how to set about it; that, being\r\npoor, they will be unable to pay; and that, under the weight of discord,\r\ndistrust, indigence, and inertia, the new law will remain a dead letter,\r\nand only exasperate their cupidity or kindle their resentment. In\r\nanticipation of this disorder the legislator will come to their\r\nassistance; he will interpose commissions of arbitration between them\r\nand the lord of the manor; he will substitute a scale of annuities for a\r\nfull and immediate redemption; he will lend them the capital which they\r\ncannot borrow elsewhere; he will establish a bank, rights, and a mode of\r\nprocedure,--in short, as in Savoy in 1771, in England in 1845,[2219] and\r\nin Russia in 1861, he will relieve the poor without despoiling the rich;\r\nhe will establish liberty without violating the rights of property; he\r\nwill conciliate interests and classes; he will not let loose a brutal\r\npeasant revolt (Jacquerie) to enforce unjust confiscation; and he will\r\nterminate the social conflict not with strife but with peace.\r\n\r\nIt is just the reverse in 1789 In conformity with the doctrine of the\r\nsocial contract, the principle is set up that every man is born free,\r\nand that his freedom has always been inalienable. If he formerly\r\nsubmitted to slavery or to serfdom, it was owing to his having had a\r\nknife at his throat; a contract of this sort is essentially null and\r\nvoid. So much the worse for those who have the benefit of it at the\r\npresent day; they are holders of stolen property, and must restore it to\r\nthe legitimate owners. Let no one object that this property was acquired\r\nfor cash down, and in good faith; they ought to have known beforehand\r\nthat man and his liberty are not commercial matters, and that unjust\r\nacquisitions rightly perish in their hands.[2220] Nobody dreams that\r\nthe State which was a party to this transaction is the responsible\r\nguarantor. Only one scruple affects the Assembly; its jurists and\r\nMerlin, its reporter, are obliged to yield to proof; they know that\r\nin current practice, and by innumerable ancient and modern titles, the\r\nnoble in many cases is nothing but an ordinary lessor, and that if, in\r\nthose cases, he collects his dues, it is simply in his capacity as a\r\nprivate person, by virtue of a mutual contract, because he has given a\r\nperpetual lease of a certain portion of his land; and he has given\r\nit only in consideration of an annual payment in money or produce, or\r\nservices, together with another contingent claim which the farmer pays\r\nin case of the transmission of the lease. These two obligations could\r\nnot be canceled without indemnity; if it were done, more than one-half\r\nof the proprietors in France would be dispossessed in favor of the\r\nfarmers. Hence the distinction which the Assembly makes in the feudal\r\ndues.--On the one hand it abolishes without indemnity all those dues\r\nwhich the noble receives by virtue of being the local sovereign, the\r\nancient proprietor of persons and the usurper of public powers; all\r\nthose which the lessee paid as serf, subject to rights of inheritance,\r\nand as former vassal or dependent. On the other hand, it maintains\r\nand decrees as redeemable at a certain rate all those which the noble\r\nreceives through his title of landed proprietor and of simple lessor;\r\nall those which the lessee pays by virtue of being a free contracting\r\nparty, former purchaser, tenant, farmer or grantee of landed estate.--By\r\nthis division it fancies that it has respected lawful ownership by\r\noverthrowing illegitimate property, and that in the feudal scheme of\r\nobligations, it has separated the wheat from the chaff.[2221]\r\n\r\nBut, through the principle, the drawing up and the omissions of its\r\nlaw, it condemns both to a common destruction; the fire on which it has\r\nthrown the chaff necessarily burns up the wheat.--Both are in fact bound\r\nup together in the same sheaf. If the noble formerly brought men under\r\nsubjection by the sword, it is also by the sword that he formerly\r\nacquired possession of the soil. If the subjection of persons is invalid\r\non account of the original stain of violence, the usurpation of the soil\r\nis invalid for the same reason. And if the sanction and guarantee of\r\nthe State could not justify the first act of brigandage, they could not\r\njustify the second; and, since the rights which are derived from unjust\r\nsovereignty are abolished without indemnity, the rights which are\r\nderived from unjust proprietorship should be likewise abolished without\r\ncompensation.----The Assembly, with remarkable imprudence, had declared\r\nin the preamble to its law that \"it abolished the feudal system\r\nentirely,\" and, whatever its ulterior reservations might be, the fiat\r\nhas gone forth. The forty thousand sovereign municipalities to which the\r\ntext of the decree is read pay attention only to the first article, and\r\nthe village attorney, imbued with the rights of man, easily proves to\r\nthese assemblies of debtors that they owe nothing to their creditors.\r\nThere must be no exceptions nor distinctions: no more annual rents,\r\nfield-rents, dues on produce, nor contingent rents, nor lord's dues and\r\nfines, or fifths.[2222] If these have been maintained by the Assembly,\r\nit is owing to misunderstanding, timidity, inconsistency, and on all\r\nsides, in the rural districts, the grumbling of disappointed greed or of\r\nunsatisfied necessities is heard:[2223]\r\n\r\n\"You thought that you were destroying feudalism, while your redemption\r\nlaws have done just the contrary. . . . Are you not aware that what was\r\ncalled a Seigneur was simply an unpunished usurper? . . . That detestable\r\ndecree of 1790 is the ruin of lease-holders. It has thrown the villages\r\ninto a state of consternation. The nobles reap all the advantage of\r\nit. . . Never will redemption be possible. Redemption of unreal claims!\r\nRedemption of dues that are detestable!\"\r\n\r\nIn vain the Assembly insists, specifies and explains by examples and\r\nby detailed instructions the mode of procedure and the conditions of\r\nredemption. Neither the procedure nor its conditions are practicable. It\r\nhas made no provisions for facilitating the agreement of parties and\r\nthe satisfaction of feudal liens, no special arbitrators, nor bank for\r\nloans, nor system of annuities. And worse still, instead of clearing the\r\nroad it has barred it by legal arrangements. The lease-holder is not\r\nto redeem his annual rent without at the same time compounding for the\r\ncontingent rent: he is not allowed on his own to redeem his quota since\r\nhe is tied up in solidarity with the other partners. Should his hoard\r\nbe a small one, so much the worse for him. Not being able to redeem the\r\nwhole, he is not allowed to redeem a part. Not having the money with\r\nwhich to relieve himself from both ground-rents and lord's dues he\r\ncannot relieve himself from ground-rents. Not having the money to\r\nliquidate the debt in full of those who are bound along with him-self,\r\nhe remains a captive in his ancient chains by virtue of the new law\r\nwhich announces to him his freedom.\r\n\r\nIn the face of these unexpected trammels the peasant becomes furious:\r\nHis fixed idea, from the outbreak of the Revolution, is that he no\r\nlonger owes anything to anybody, and, among the speeches, decrees,\r\nproclamations, and instructions which rumor brings to his ears, he\r\ncomprehends but one phrase, and is determined to comprehend no other,\r\nand that is, that henceforth his obligations are removed. He does not\r\nswerve from this, and since the law hinders, instead of aiding him, he\r\nwill break the law. In fact, after the 4th of August, 1789, feudal dues\r\ncease to be collected. The claims which are maintained are not enforced\r\nany more than those which are suppressed. Whole communities come and\r\ngive notice to the lord of the manor that they will not pay any more\r\nrent. Others, with sword in hand, compel him to give them acquittances.\r\nOthers again, to be more secure, break open his safe, and throw his\r\ntitle-deeds into the fire.[2224] Public force is nowhere strong enough\r\nto protect him in his legal rights. Officers dare not serve writs, the\r\ncourts dare not give judgment, administrative bodies dare not decree in\r\nhis favor. He is despoiled through the connivance, the neglect, or\r\nthe impotence of all the authorities which ought to defend him. He is\r\nabandoned to the peasants who fell his forests, under the pretext that\r\nthey formerly belonged to the commune; who take possession of his\r\nmill, his wine-press, and his oven, under the pretext that territorial\r\nprivileges are suppressed.[2225] Most of the gentry of the provinces are\r\nruined, without any resource, and have not even their daily bread; for\r\ntheir income consisted in seignorial rights, and in rents derived from\r\ntheir real property, which they had let on perpetual leases, and now,\r\nin accordance with the law, one-half of this income ceases to be paid,\r\nwhile the other half ceases to be paid in spite of the law. One hundred\r\nand twenty-three millions of revenue, representing two thousand millions\r\nand a half of capital in the money of that time, double, at least, that\r\nof the present day, thus passes as a gift, or through the toleration of\r\nthe National Assembly, from the hands of creditors into those of their\r\ndebtors. To this must be added an equal sum for revenue and capital\r\narising from the tithes which are suppressed without compensation, and\r\nby the same stroke.--This is the commencement of the great revolutionary\r\noperation, that is to say, of the universal bankruptcy which, directly\r\nor indirectly, is to destroy all contracts, and abolish all debts in\r\nFrance. Violations of property, especially of private property, cannot\r\nbe made with impunity. The Assembly desired to lop off only the\r\nfeudal branch; but, in admitting that the State can annul, without\r\ncompensation, the obligations which it has guaranteed, it put the ax to\r\nthe root of the tree, and other rougher hands are already driving it in\r\nup to the haft.\r\n\r\nNothing now remains to the noble but his title, his territorial name,\r\nand his armorial bearings, which are innocent distinctions, since they\r\nno longer confer any jurisdiction or pre-eminence upon him, and which,\r\nas the law ceases to protect him, the first comer may borrow with\r\nimpunity. Not only, moreover, do they do no harm, but they are even\r\nworthy of respect. With many of the nobles the title of the estate\r\ncovers the family name, the former alone being made use of. If one\r\nwere substituted for the other, the public would have difficulty in\r\ndiscovering M. de Mirabeau, Lafayette, and M. de Moutmorency, under the\r\nnew names Riquetti, M. Mottié, and M. Bouchard. Besides, it would be\r\nwrong to the bearer of it, to whom the abolished title is a legitimate\r\npossession, often precious, it being a certificate of quality and\r\ndescent, an authentic personal distinction of which he cannot be\r\ndeprived without losing his position, rank, and worth, in the human\r\nworld around him.--The Assembly, however, with a popular principle\r\nat stake, gives no heed to public utility, nor to the rights of\r\nindividuals. The feudal system being abolished, all that remains of\r\nit must be got rid of. A decree is passed that \"hereditary nobility is\r\noffensive to reason and to true liberty;\" that, where it exists, \"there\r\nis no political equality.\"[2226] Every French citizen is forbidden to\r\nassume or retain the titles of prince, duke, count, marquis, chevalier,\r\nand the like, and to bear any other than the \"true name of his family;\"\r\nhe is prohibited from making his servants wear liveries, and from having\r\ncoats-of-arms on his house or on his carriage. In case of any infraction\r\nof this law a penalty is inflicted upon him equal to six times the sum\r\nof his personal taxes; he is to be struck off the register of citizens,\r\nand declared incapable of holding any civil or military office. There\r\nis the same punishment if to any contract or acquittance he affixes his\r\naccustomed signature; if; through habit or inadvertence, he adds the\r\ntitle of his estate to his family name--if; with a view to recognition,\r\nand to render his identity certain, he merely mentions that he once bore\r\nthe former name. Any notary or public officer who shall write, or allow\r\nto be written, in any document the word ci-devant (formerly) is to be\r\nsuspended from his functions. Not only are old names thus abolished, but\r\nan effort is made to efface all remembrance of them. In a little while,\r\nthe childish law will become a murderous one. It will be but a little\r\nwhile and, according to the terms of this same decree, a military\r\nveteran of seventy-seven years, a loyal servant of the Republic, and a\r\nbrigadier-general under the Convention, will be arrested on returning to\r\nhis native village, because he has mechanically signed the register of\r\nthe revolutionary committee as Montperreux instead of Vannod, and, for\r\nthis infraction, he will be guillotined along with his brother and his\r\nsister-in-law.[2227]\r\n\r\nOnce on this road, it is impossible to stop; for the principles which\r\nare proclaimed go beyond the decrees which are passed, and a bad law\r\nintroduces a worse. The Constituent Assembly[2228] had supposed that\r\nannual dues, like ground-rents, and contingent dues, like feudal duties\r\n(lods et rentes), were the price of an ancient concession of land, and,\r\nconsequently, the proof to the contrary is to be thrown upon the tenant.\r\nThe Legislative Assembly is about to assume that these same rentals\r\nare the result of an old feudal usurpation, and that, consequently, the\r\nproof to the contrary must rest with the proprietor. His rights cannot\r\nbe established by possession from time immemorial, nor by innumerable\r\nand regular acquittances; he must produce the act of enfeoffment which\r\nis many centuries old, the lease which has never, perhaps, been written\r\nout, the primitive title already rare in 1720,[2229] and since stolen\r\nor burnt in the recent jacqueries: otherwise he is despoiled without\r\nindemnity. All feudal claims are swept away by this act without\r\nexception and without compensation.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner, the Constituent Assembly, setting common law aside\r\nin relation to inheritances ab intestato, had deprived all eldest sons\r\nand males of any advantages.[2230] The Convention, suppressing the\r\nfreedom of testamentary bequest, prohibits the father from disposing\r\nof more than one-tenth of his possessions; and again, going back to the\r\npast, it makes its decrees retrospective: every will opened after the\r\n14th of July, 1789, is declared invalid if not in conformity with\r\nthis decree; every succession from the 14th of June, 1789, which is\r\nadministered after the same date, is re-divided if the division has not\r\nbeen equal; every donation which has been made among the heirs after the\r\nsame date is void. Not only is the feudal family destroyed in this way,\r\nbut it must never be reformed. The aristocracy, being once declared a\r\nvenomous plant, it is not sufficient to prime it away, but it must be\r\nextirpated, not only dug up by the root, but its seed must be crushed\r\nout.--A malignant prejudice is aroused against it, and this grows from\r\nday to day. The stings of self-conceit, the disappointments of ambition,\r\nand envious sentiments have prepared the way. Its hard, dry kernel\r\nconsists of the abstract idea of equality. All around revolutionary\r\nfervor has caused blood to flow, has embittered tempers, intensified\r\nsensibilities, and created a painful abscess which daily irritation\r\nrenders still more painful. Through steadily brooding over a purely\r\nspeculative preference this has become a fixed idea, and is becoming\r\na murderous one. It is a strange passion, one wholly of the brains,\r\nnourished by magniloquent phrases, but the more destructive, because\r\nphantoms are created out of words, and against phantoms no reasoning nor\r\nactual facts can prevail. This or that shopkeeper who, up to this time,\r\nhad always formed his idea of nobles from his impressions of the members\r\nof the Parliament of his town or of the gentry of his canton, now\r\npictures them according to the declamations of the club and the\r\ninvectives of the newspapers. The imaginary figure, in his mind, has\r\ngradually absorbed the living figure: he no longer sees the calm and\r\nengaging countenance, but a grinning and distorted mask. Kindliness or\r\nindifference is replaced by animosity and distrust; they are overthrown\r\ntyrants, ancient evil-doers, And enemies of the public; he is satisfied\r\nbeforehand and without further investigation that they are hatching\r\nplots. If they avoid being caught, it is owing to their address and\r\nperfidy, and they are only the more dangerous the more inoffensive\r\nthey appear. Their sub-mission is merely a feint, their resignation\r\nhypocrisy, their favorable disposition, treachery. Against these\r\nconspirators who cannot be touched the law is inadequate; let us stretch\r\nit in practice, and as they wince at equality let us try to make them\r\nbow beneath the yoke.\r\n\r\nIn fact, illegal persecution precedes legal prosecution; the privileged\r\nperson who, by the late decrees, seems merely to be brought within the\r\npale of the common law, is, in fact; driven outside of it. The King,\r\ndisarmed, is no longer able to protect him; the partial Assembly repels\r\nhis complaints; the committee of inquiry regards him as a culprit\r\nwhen he is simply oppressed. His income, his property, his repose, his\r\nfreedom, his home, his life, that of his wife and of his children, are\r\nin the hands of an administration elected by the crowd, directed by\r\nclubs, and threatened or violated by the mob. He is debarred from the\r\nelections. The newspapers denounce him. He undergoes domiciliary\r\nvisits. In hundreds of places his chateau is sacked; the assassins and\r\nincendiaries who depart from it with their hands full and steeped in\r\nblood are not prosecuted, or are shielded by an amnesty:[2231] it is\r\nestablished by innumerable precedents that he may be run down with\r\nimpunity. To prevent him from defending himself, companies of the\r\nNational Guard come and seize his arms: he must become a prey, and\r\nan easy prey, like game kept back in its enclosure for an approaching\r\nhunt.--In vain he abstains from provocation and reduces himself to\r\nthe standing of a private individual. In vain does he patiently endure\r\nnumerous provocations and resist only extreme violence. I have read\r\nmany hundreds of investigations in the original manuscripts, and almost\r\nalways I have admired the humanity of the nobles, their forbearance,\r\ntheir horror of bloodshed. Not only are a great many of them men of\r\ncourage and all men of honor, but also, educated in the philosophy of\r\nthe eighteenth century, they are mild, sensitive, and deeds of violence\r\nare repugnant to them. Military officers especially are exemplary, their\r\ngreat defect being their weakness: rather than fire on the crowd they\r\nsurrender the forts under their command, and allow themselves to be\r\ninsulted and stoned by the people. For two years,[2232] \"exposed to a\r\nthousand outrages, to defamation, to daily peril, persecuted by clubs\r\nand misguided soldiers,\" disobeyed, menaced, put under arrest by their\r\nown men, they remain at their post to prevent the ranks from being\r\nbroken up; \"with stoic perseverance they put up with contempt of their\r\nauthority that they may preserve its semblance, their courage is of that\r\nrarest kind which consists in remaining at the post of duty, impassive\r\nbeneath both affronts and blows.--Through a wrong of the greatest\r\nmagnitude, an entire class which have no share in the favors of\r\nthe Court, and which suffered as many injuries as any of the common\r\nplebeians, is confounded with the titled parasites who besiege the\r\nantechambers of Versailles. Twenty-five thousand families, \"the nursery\r\nof the army and the fleet,\" the elite of the agricultural proprietors,\r\nalso many gentlemen who look after and turn to account the little\r\nestates on which they live, and \"who have not left their homes a year in\r\ntheir lives,\" become the pariahs of their canton.[2233] After 1789, they\r\nbegin to feel that their position is no longer tenable.[2234]\r\n\r\n\" It is absolutely in opposition to the rights of man,\" says another\r\nletter from Franche-Comté, \"to find one's self in perpetual fear of\r\nhaving one's throat cut by scoundrels who are daily confounding liberty\r\nwith license.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never knew anything so wearying,\" says another letter from Champagne,\r\n\"as this anxiety about property and security. Never was there a better\r\nreason for it. A moment suffices to let loose an intractable population\r\nwhich thinks that it may do what it pleases, and which is carefully\r\nsustained in that error.\"\r\n\r\n\"After the sacrifices that we have made,\" says a letter from Burgundy,\r\n\"we could not expect such treatment. I thought that our property would\r\nbe the last violated because the people owed us some return for staying\r\nat home in the country to expend among them the few resources that\r\nremain to us. . . (Now), I beg the Assembly to repeal the decree on\r\nemigration; otherwise it may be said that people are purposely kept here\r\nto be assassinated. . . In case it should refuse to do us this justice,\r\nI should be quite as willing to have it decree an act of proscription\r\nagainst us, for we should not then be lulled to sleep by the protection\r\nof laws which are doubtless very wise, but which are not respected\r\nanywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\" It is not our privileges,\" say several others, \"it is not our nobility\r\nthat we regret; but how is the persecution to which we are abandoned to\r\nbe supported? There is no safety for us, for our property, or for our\r\nfamilies. Wretches who are our debtors, the small farmers who rob us of\r\nour incomes, daily threaten us with the torch and the lamp post. We do\r\nnot enjoy one hour of repose; not a night that we are certain to\r\npass through without trouble. Our persons are given up to the vilest\r\noutrages, our dwellings to an inquisition of armed tyrants; we are\r\nrobbed of our rentals with impunity, and our property is openly\r\nattacked. We, being now the only people to pay imposts, are unfairly\r\ntaxed; in various places our entire incomes would not suffice to pay\r\nthe quota which crushes us. We can make no complaint without incurring\r\nthe risk of being massacred. The tribunals and the administrative\r\nbodies, the tools of the multitude, daily sacrifice us to its attacks.\r\nEven the Government seems afraid of compromising itself by claiming the\r\nprotection of the laws on our behalf. It is sufficient to be pointed\r\nout as an aristocrat to be without any security. If our peasants, in\r\ngeneral, have shown more honesty, consideration, and attachment toward\r\nus, every bourgeois of importance, the wild members of clubs, the vilest\r\nof men who sully a uniform, consider themselves privileged to insult us,\r\nand these wretches go unpunished and are protected! Even our religion\r\nis not free. One of our number has had his house sacked for having shown\r\nhospitality to an old curé of eighty belonging to his parish who refused\r\nto take the oath. Such is our fate. We are not so base as to endure it.\r\nOur right to resist oppression is not due to a decree of the National\r\nAssembly, but to natural law. We are going to leave, and to die if\r\nnecessary. But to live under such a revolting anarchy! Should it not be\r\nbroken up we shall never set foot in France again!\"\r\n\r\nThe operation is successful. The Assembly, through its decrees and\r\ninstitutions, through the laws it enacts and the violence which it\r\ntolerates, has uprooted the aristocracy and cast it out of the country.\r\nThe nobles, now the reverse of privileged, cannot remain in a country\r\nwhere, while respecting the law, they are really beyond its pale. Those\r\nwho first emigrated on the 15th of July, 1789, along with the Prince de\r\nCondé, received at their houses the evening before they left a list of\r\nthe proscribed on which their names appeared, and a reward was\r\npromised to whoever would bring their heads to the cellar of the\r\nPalais-Royal--Others, in larger numbers, left after the occurrences\r\nof the 6th of October.--During the last months of the Constituent\r\nAssembly,[2235]\r\n\r\n\"the emigration goes on in companies composed of men of every condition.\r\n. . . Twelve hundred gentlemen have left Poitou alone; Auvergne,\r\nLimousin, and ten other provinces have been equally depopulated of their\r\nlandowners. There are towns in which nobody remains but common workmen,\r\na club, and the crowd of devouring office-holders created by the\r\nConstitution. All the nobles in Brittany have left, and the emigration\r\nhas begun in Normandy, and is going on in the frontier provinces.\r\n\r\n\"More than two-thirds of the army will be without officers.\" On being\r\ncalled upon to take the new oath in which the King's name is purposely\r\nomitted, \"six thousand officers send in their resignation.\"\r\n\r\nThe example gradually becomes contagious; they are men of the sword, and\r\ntheir honor is at stake. Many of them join the princes at Coblentz,\r\nand subsequently do battle against France in the belief that they are\r\ncontending only against their executioners.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the nobles by the Assembly is the same as the treatment\r\nof the Protestants by Louis XIV.[2236] In both cases the oppressed are a\r\nsuperior class of men. In both cases France has been made uninhabitable\r\nfor them. In both cases they are reduced to exile, and they are\r\npunished because they exiled them selves. In both cases it ended in a\r\nconfiscation of their property, and in the penalty of death to all who\r\nshould harbor them. In both cases, by dint of persecution, they are\r\ndriven to revolt. The insurrection of La Vendée corresponds with the\r\ninsurrection of the Cévennes; and the emigrants, like the refugees of\r\nformer times, will be found under the flags of Prussia and of England.\r\nOne hundred thousand Frenchmen driven out at the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, and one hundred thousand driven out at the end of the\r\neighteenth century! Mark how an intolerant democracy completes the work\r\nof an intolerant monarchy. The moral aristocracy was mowed down in the\r\nname of uniformity; the social aristocracy is mowed down in the name of\r\nequality. For the second time, an absolute principle, and with the same\r\neffect, buries its blade in the heart of a living society.\r\n\r\nThe success is complete. One of the deputies of the Legislative\r\nAssembly, early in its session, on being informed of the great increase\r\nin emigration, joyfully exclaims,\r\n\r\n\"SO MUCH THE BETTER; FRANCE IS BEING PURGED!\"\r\n\r\nShe is, in truth, being depleted of one-half of her best blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--Abuse and lukewarmness in 1789 in the ecclesiastical bodies.\r\n\r\n     How the State used its right of overseeing and reforming\r\n     them.--Social usefulness of corporations.--The sound part in\r\n     the monastic institution.--Zeal and services of nuns.--How\r\n     ecclesiastical possessions should be employed.--Principle of\r\n     the Assembly as to private communities, feudal rights and\r\n     trust-funds.--Abolition and expropriation all corporations.\r\n     --Uncompensated suppression of tithes.--Confiscation of\r\n     ecclesiastical possessions.--Effect on the Treasury and on\r\n     expropriated services.--The civil constitution of the\r\n     clergy.--Rights of the Church in relation to the State.\r\n     --Certainty and effects of a conflict.--Priests considered as\r\n     State-functionaries.--Principal stipulations of the law.\r\n     --Obligations of the oath.--The majority of priests refuse to\r\n     take it.--The majority of believes on their side.\r\n     --Persecution of believers and of priests.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere remained the corporate, ecclesiastic, and lay bodies, and,\r\nnotably, the oldest, most opulent, and most considerable of all the\r\nregular and secular clergy.--Grave abuses existed here also, for, the\r\ninstitution being founded on ancient requirements, had not accommodated\r\nitself to new necessities.[2237] There were too many episcopal sees,\r\nand these were arranged according to the Christian distribution of\r\nthe population in the fourth century; a revenue still more badly\r\napportioned--bishops and abbés with one hundred thousand livres a year,\r\nleading the lives of amiable idlers, while curés, overburdened with\r\nwork, have but seven hundred; in one monastery nineteen monks instead\r\nof eighty, and in another four instead of fifty;[2238] a number of\r\nmonasteries reduced to three or to two inhabitants, and even to one;\r\nalmost all the congregations of men going to decay, and many of them\r\ndying out for lack of novices;[2239] a general lukewarmness among the\r\nmembers, great laxity in many establishments, and with scandals in some\r\nof them; scarcely one-third taking an interest in their calling, while\r\nthe remaining two-thirds wish to go back to the world,[2240]--it is\r\nevident from all this that the primitive inspiration has been diverted\r\nor has cooled; that the endowment only partially fulfills its ends;\r\nthat one-half of its resources are employed in the wrong way or\r\nremain sterile; in short, that there is a need of reformation in the\r\nbody.--That this ought to be effected with the co-operation of the State\r\nand even under its direction is not less certain. For a corporation\r\nis not an individual like other individuals, and, in order that it may\r\nacquire or possess the privileges of an ordinary citizen, something\r\nsupplementary must be added, some fiction, some expedient of the law.\r\nIf the law is disposed to overlook the fact that a corporation is not a\r\nnatural personage, if it gives to it a civil personality, if it declares\r\nit to be capable of inheriting, of acquiring and of selling, if it\r\nbecomes a protected and respected proprietor, this is due to the favors\r\nof the State which places its tribunal and gendarmes at its service, and\r\nwhich, in exchange for this service, justly imposes conditions on it,\r\nand, among others, that of being useful and remaining useful, or at\r\nleast that of never becoming harmful. Such was the rule under the\r\nAncient Régime, and especially since the Government has for the last\r\nquarter of a century gradually and efficaciously worked out a reform.\r\nNot only, in 1749, had it prohibited the Church from accepting land,\r\neither by donation, by testament, or in exchange, without royal\r\nletters-patent registered in Parliament; not only in 1764 had it\r\nabolished the order of Jesuits, closed their colleges and sold their\r\npossessions, but also, since 1766, a permanent commission, formed by\r\nthe King's order and instructed by him, had lopped off all the dying and\r\ndead branches of the ecclesiastical tree.[2241] There was a revision of\r\nthe primitive Constitutions; a prohibition to every institution to have\r\nmore than two monasteries at Paris and more than one in other towns; a\r\npostponement of the age for taking vows--that of sixteen being no longer\r\npermitted--to twenty-one for men and eighteen for women; an obligatory\r\nminimum of monks and nuns for each establishment, which varies from\r\nfifteen to nine according to circumstances; if this is not kept up there\r\nfollows a suppression or prohibition to receive novices: owing to\r\nthese measures, rigorously executed, at the end of twelve years\r\n\"the Grammontins, the Servites, the Celestins, the ancient order of\r\nSaint-Bénédict, that of the Holy Ghost of Montpellier, and those\r\nof Sainte-Brigitte, Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie, Saint-Ruff, and\r\nSaint-Antoine,\"--in short, nine complete congregations had disappeared.\r\nAt the end of twenty years three hundred and eighty-six establishments\r\nhad been suppressed, the number of monks and nuns had diminished\r\none-third, the larger portion of possessions which had escheated were\r\nusefully applied, and the congregations of men lacked novices and\r\ncomplained that they could not fill up their ranks. If the monks were\r\nstill found to be too numerous, too wealthy, and too indolent, it was\r\nmerely necessary to keep on in this way; before the end of the century,\r\nmerely by the application of the edict, the institution would be\r\nbrought back, without brutality or injustice, within the scope of the\r\ndevelopment, the limitations of fortune, and the class of functions\r\nacceptable to a modern State.\r\n\r\nBut, because these ecclesiastical bodies stood in need of reform it does\r\nnot follow that it was necessary to destroy them, nor, in general,\r\nthat independent institutions are detrimental to a nation. Organized\r\npurposely for a public service, and possessing, nearly or remotely under\r\nthe supervision of the State, the faculty of self-administration, these\r\nbodies are valuable organs and not malign tumors.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, through their institution, a great public benefit\r\nis secured without any cost to the government--worship, scientific\r\nresearch, primary or higher education, help for the poor, care of the\r\nsick--all set apart and sheltered from the cuts which public financial\r\ndifficulties might make necessary, and supported by the private\r\ngenerosity which, finding a ready receptacle at hand, gathers together,\r\ncentury after century, its thousands of scattered springs: as an\r\nexample, note the wealth, stability, and usefulness of the English and\r\nGerman universities.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, their institution furnishes an obstacle to the\r\nomnipotence of the State; their walls provide a protection against the\r\nleveling standardization of absolute monarchy or of pure democracy. A\r\nman can here freely develop himself without donning the livery of\r\neither courtier or demagogue, he can acquire wealth, consideration and\r\nauthority, without being indebted to the caprices of either royal or\r\npopular favor; he can stand firm against established or prevailing\r\nopinions sheltered by associates bound by their esprit de corps. Such,\r\nat the present day (1885), is the situation of a professor at Oxford,\r\nGöttingen, and Harvard Such, under the Ancient Régime, were a bishop, a\r\nmember of the French Parliaments, and even a plain attorney. What can\r\nbe worse than universal bureaucracy, producing a mechanical and servile\r\nuniformity! Those who serve the public need not all be Government\r\nclerks; in countries where an aristocracy has perished, bodies of this\r\nkind are their last place of refuge.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, through such institutions, distinct original\r\nsocieties may come to be inside the great commonplace world. Here\r\nspecial personalities may find the only existence that suits them. If\r\ndevout or laborious, not only do these afford an outlet for the deeper\r\nneeds of conscience, of the imagination, of activity, and of discipline,\r\nbut also they serve as dikes which restrain and direct them in a channel\r\nwhich will lead to the creation of a masterpiece of infinite value. In\r\nthis way thousands of men and women fulfill at small cost, voluntarily\r\nand gratis, and with great effect, the least attractive and more\r\nrepulsive social needs, thus performing in human society the role which,\r\ninside the ant-hill, we see assigned to the sexless worker-ant.[2242]\r\n\r\nThus, at bottom, the institution was really good, and if it had to be\r\ncauterized it was merely essential to remove the inert or corrupted\r\nparts and preserve the healthy and sound parts.--Now, if we take only\r\nthe monastic bodies, there were more than one-half of these entitled\r\nto respect. I omit those monks, one-third of whom remained zealous and\r\nexemplary-the Benedictines, who continue the \"Gallia Christiana,\" with\r\nothers who, at sixty years of age, labor in rooms without a fire;\r\nthe Trappists, who cultivate the ground with their own hands, and the\r\ninnumerable monasteries which serve as educational seminaries, bureaus\r\nof charity, hospices for shelter, and of which all the villages in their\r\nneighborhood demand the conservation by the National Assembly.[2243]\r\nI have to mention the nuns, thirty-seven thousand in fifteen hundred\r\nconvents. Here, except in the twenty-five chapters of canonesses, which\r\nare a semi-worldly rendezvous for poor young girls of noble birth,\r\nfervor, frugality, and usefulness are almost everywhere incontestable.\r\nOne of the members of the Ecclesiastical Committee admits in the\r\nAssembly tribunal that, in all their letters and addresses, the nuns ask\r\nto be allowed to remain in their cloisters; their entreaties, in fact,\r\nare as earnest as they are affecting.[2244] One Community writes,\r\n\r\n\"We should prefer the sacrifice of our lives to that of our calling\r\n. . . . This is not the voice of some among our sisters, but of all. The\r\nNational Assembly has established the claims of liberty-would it prevent\r\nthe exercise of these by the only disinterested beings who ardently\r\ndesire to be useful, and have renounced society solely to be of greater\r\nservice to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The little contact we have with the world,\" writes another \"is the\r\nreason why our contentment is so little known. But it is not the less\r\nreal and substantial. We know of no distinctions, no privileges amongst\r\nourselves; our misfortunes and our property are in common. One in heart\r\nand one in soul. . . we protest before the nation, in the face of heaven\r\nand of earth, that it is not in the power of any being to shake our\r\nfidelity to our vows, which vows we renew with still more ardor than\r\nwhen we first pronounced them.\"[2245]\r\n\r\nMany of the communities have no means of subsistence other than the work\r\nof their own hands and the small dowries the nuns have brought with\r\nthem on entering the convent. So great, however is their frugality and\r\neconomy, that the total expenditure of each nun does not surpass 250\r\nlivres a year. The Annonciades of Saint-Amour say,\r\n\r\n\"We, thirty-three nuns, both choristers and those of the white veil,\r\nlive on 4,400 livres net income, without being a charge to our families\r\nor to the public. . . If we were living in society, our expenses would\r\nbe three times as much;\" and, not content with providing for themselves,\r\nthey give in charity.\r\n\r\nAmong these communities several hundreds are educational establishments;\r\na very great number give gratuitous primary instruction.--Now, in 1789,\r\nthere are no other schools for girls, and were these to be suppressed,\r\nevery avenue of instruction and culture would be closed to one of the\r\ntwo sexes, forming one-half of the French population. Fourteen thousand\r\nsisters of charity, distributed among four hundred and twenty convents,\r\nlook after the hospitals, attend upon the sick, serve the infirm,\r\nbring up foundlings, provide for orphans, lying-in women, and repentant\r\nprostitutes. The \"Visitation\" is an asylum for \"those who are not\r\nfavored by nature,\"--and, in those days, there were many more of the\r\ndisfigured than at present, since out of every eight deaths one was\r\ncaused by the smallpox. Widows are received here, as well as girls\r\nwithout means and without protection, persons \"worn out with the\r\nagitation of the world,\" those who are too feeble to support the battle\r\nof life, those who withdraw from it wounded or invalid, and \"the rules\r\nof the order, not very strict, are not beyond the health or strength\r\nof the most frail and delicate.\" Some ingenious device of charity thus\r\napplies to each moral or social sore, with skill and care, the proper\r\nand proportionate dressing. And finally, far from falling off, nearly\r\nall these communities are in a flourishing state, and whilst among the\r\nestablishments for men there are only nine, on the average, to each,\r\nin those for women there is an average of twenty-four. Here, at\r\nSaint-Flour, is one which is bringing up fifty boarders; another, at\r\nBeaulieu, instructs one hundred; another, in Franche-Comté, has charge\r\nof eight hundred abandoned children.[2246]--Evidently, in the presence\r\nof such institutions one must pause, however little one may care for\r\njustice and the public interest; and, moreover, because it is useless\r\nto act rigorously against them the legislator crushes them in vain, for\r\nthey spring up again of their own accord; they are in the blood of every\r\nCatholic nation. In France, instead of thirty-seven thousand nuns, at\r\nthe present day (1866) there are eighty-six thousand-that is to say,\r\nforty-five in every ten thousand women instead of twenty-eight.[2247]\r\n\r\nIn any case, if the State deprives them of their property, along with\r\nthat of other ecclesiastical bodies, it is not the State that ought\r\nto claim the spoil.--The State is not their heir, and their land,\r\nfurniture, and rentals are in their very nature devoted to a special\r\npurpose, although they have no designated proprietor. This treasure,\r\nwhich consists of the accumulations of fourteen centuries, has been\r\nformed, increased, and preserved, in view of a certain object. The\r\nmillions of generous, repentant, or devout souls who have made a gift\r\nof it, or have managed it, did so with a certain intention. It was their\r\ndesire to ensure education, beneficence, and religion, and nothing else.\r\nTheir legitimate intentions should not be frustrated: the dead have\r\nrights in society as well as the living, for it is the dead who have\r\nmade the society which the living enjoy, and we receive their heritage\r\nonly on the condition of executing their testamentary act.--Should\r\nthis be of ancient date, it is undoubtedly necessary to make a liberal\r\ninterpretation of it; to supplement its scanty provisions, and to take\r\nnew circumstances into consideration. The requirements for which it\r\nprovided have often disappeared; for instance, after the destruction of\r\nthe Barbary pirates, there were no more Christians to be ransomed; and\r\nonly by transferring an endowment can it be perpetuated.--But if, in the\r\noriginal institution, several accessory and special clauses have become\r\nantiquated, there remains the one important, general intention, which\r\nmanifestly continues imperative and permanent, that of providing for a\r\ndistinct service, either of charity, of worship, or of instruction. Let\r\nthe administrators be changed, if necessary, also the apportionment of\r\nthe legacy bequeathed, but do not divert any of it to services of an\r\nalien character; it is inapplicable to any but that purpose or to others\r\nstrictly analogous. The four milliards of investment in real property,\r\nthe two hundred millions of ecclesiastical income, form for it an\r\nexpress and special endowment. This is not a pile of gold abandoned on\r\nthe highway, which the exchequer can appropriate or assign to those who\r\nlive by the roadside. Authentic titles to it exist, which, declaring its\r\norigin, fix its destination, and your business is simply to see that\r\nit reaches its destination. Such was the principle under the ancient\r\nrégime, in spite of grave abuses, and under forced exactions. When the\r\necclesiastical commission suppressed an ecclesiastical order, it was not\r\nfor the purpose of making its possessions over to the public treasury,\r\nbut to apply these to seminaries, schools, and hospitals. In 1789, the\r\nrevenues of Saint-Denis supported Saint-Cyr; those of Saint Germain went\r\nto the Economats, and the Government, although absolute and needy, was\r\nsufficiently honest to adjust that confiscation was robbery. The greater\r\nour power, the greater the obligation to be just, and honesty always\r\nproves in the end to be the best policy.--It is, therefore, both just\r\nand useful that the Church, as in England and in America, that superior\r\neducation, as in England and in Germany, that special instruction, as in\r\nAmerica, and that diverse endowments for public assistance and utility,\r\nshould be unreservedly secured in the maintenance of their heritage. The\r\nState, as testamentary executor of this inheritance, strangely abuses\r\nits mandate when it pockets the bequest in order to choke the deficit of\r\nits own treasury, risking it in bad speculations, and swallowing it\r\nup in its own bankruptcy, until of this vast treasure, which has been\r\nheaped up for generations for the benefit of children, the infirm,\r\nthe sick and the poor, not enough is left to pay the salary of a\r\nschool-mistress, the wages of a parish nurse, or for a bowl of broth in\r\na hospital.[2248]\r\n\r\nThe Assembly remains deaf to all these arguments, and that which makes\r\nits refuse to listen is not financial distress.--The Archbishop of Aix,\r\nM. de Boisjelin, offered, in the name of the clergy, to liquidate\r\nat once the debt of three hundred millions, which was urgent, by a\r\nmortgage-loan of four hundred millions on the ecclesiastical property,\r\nwhich was a very good expedient; for at this time the credit of the\r\nclergy is the only substantial one. It generally borrows at less than\r\nfive per cent., and more money has always been offered to it than it\r\nwanted, whilst the State borrows at ten per cent., and, at this moment,\r\nthere are no lenders.--But, to our new revolutionary statesmen,\r\nthe cost-benefit of a service is of much less consequence than the\r\napplication of a principle. In conformity with the Social Contract they\r\nestablish the maxim that in the State there is no need of corporate\r\nbodies: they acknowledge nothing but, on the one hand, the State, the\r\ndepositary of all public powers, and, on the other hand, a myriad of\r\nsolitary individuals. Special associations, specific groups, collateral\r\ncorporations are not wanted, even to fulfill functions which the State\r\nis incapable of fulfilling. \"As soon as one enters a corporation,\" says\r\nand orator, \"one must love it as one loves a family;\"[2249] whereas\r\nthe affections and obedience are all to be monopolized by the State.\r\nMoreover, on entering into an order a man receives special aid and\r\ncomfort from it, and whatever distinguishes one man from another, is\r\nopposed to civil equality. Hence, if men are to remain equal and become\r\ncitizens they must be deprived of every rallying point that might\r\ncompete with that of the State, and give to some an advantage over\r\nothers. All natural or acquired ties, consequently, which bound men\r\ntogether through geographical position, through climate, history,\r\npursuits, and trade, are sundered. The old provinces, the old provincial\r\ngovernments, the old municipal administrations, parliaments, guilds\r\nand masterships, all are suppressed. The groups which spring up most\r\nnaturally, those which arise through a community of interests, are\r\nall dispersed, and the broadest, most express, and most positive\r\ninterdictions are promulgated against their revival under any pretext\r\nwhatever.[2250] France is cut up into geometrical sections like a\r\nchess-board, and, within these improvised limits, which are destined\r\nfor a long time to remain artificial, nothing is allowed to subsist\r\nbut isolated individuals in juxtaposition. There is no desire to spare\r\norganized bodies where the cohesion is great, and least of all that\r\nof the clergy. \"Special associations,\" says Mirabeau,[2251] \"in the\r\ncommunity at large, break up the unity of its principles and destroy\r\nthe equilibrium of its forces. Large political bodies in a State are\r\ndangerous through the strength which results from their coalition and\r\nthe resistance which is born out of their interests.\" ii--That of the\r\nclergy, besides, is inherently bad,[2252] because \"its system is in\r\nconstant antagonism to the rights of man.\" An institution in which a\r\nvow of obedience is necessary is \"incompatible\" with the constitution.\r\nCongregations \"subject to independent chiefs are out of the social pale\r\nand incompatible with public spirit.\" As to the right of society over\r\nthese, and also over the Church, this is not doubtful. \"Corporate bodies\r\nexist only through society, and, in destroying them, society merely\r\ntakes back the life she has imparted to them.\" \"They are simply\r\ninstruments fabricated by the law.[2253] What does the workman do\r\nwhen the tool he works with no longer suits him? He breaks or alters\r\nit.\"--This primary sophism being admitted the conclusion is plain. Since\r\ncorporate bodies are abolished they no longer exist, and since they no\r\nlonger exist, they cannot again become proprietors.\r\n\r\n\"Your aim was to destroy ecclesiastical orders,[2254] because their\r\ndestruction was essential to the safety of the State. If the clergy\r\npreserve their property, the clerical order is not destroyed: you\r\nnecessarily leave it the right of assembling; you sanction its\r\nindependence.\" In no case must ecclesiastics hold possessions. \"If they\r\nare proprietors they are independent, and if they are independent they\r\nwill associate this independence with the exercise of their functions.\"\r\nThe clergy, cost what it will, must be in the hands of the State, as\r\nsimple functionaries and supported by its subsidies. It would be too\r\ndangerous for a nation, \"to admit in its bosom as proprietors a large\r\nbody of men to whom so many sources of credit already give so great\r\npower. As religion is the property of all, its ministers, through this\r\nfact alone, should be in the pay of the nation;\" they are essentially\r\n\"officers of morality and instruction,\" and \"salaried\" like judges and\r\nprofessors. Let us fetch them back to this condition of things, which\r\nis the only one compatible with the rights of man, and ordain that\r\n\"the clergy, as well as all corporations and bodies with power of\r\ninheritance, are now, and shall be for ever incapable of holding any\r\npersonal or landed estate.\"[2255]\r\n\r\nWho, now, is the legitimate heir of all these vacated possessions?\r\nThrough another sophism, the State, at once judge and party in the\r\ncause, assigns them to the State:\r\n\r\n\"The founders presented them to the Church, that is to say, to the\r\nnation.\"[2256] \"Since the nation has permitted their possession by\r\nthe clergy, she may re-demand that which is possessed only through her\r\nauthorization.\" \"The principle must be maintained that every nation is\r\nsolely and veritably proprietor of the possessions of its clergy.\"\r\n\r\nThis principle, it must be noted, as it is laid down, involves the\r\ndestruction of ecclesiastical and lay corporations, along with the\r\nconfiscation of all their possessions, and soon we shall see appearing\r\non the horizon the final and complete decree[2257] by which the\r\nLegislative Assembly,\r\n\r\n\"considering that a State truly free should not suffer any corporation\r\nwithin its bosom, not even those which, devoted to public instruction,\r\ndeserve well of the country,\" not even those \"which are solely devoted\r\nto the service of the hospitals-and the relief of the sick,\" suppresses\r\nall congregations, all associations of men or of women, lay or\r\necclesiastical, all endowments for pious, charitable, and missionary\r\npurposes, all houses of education, all seminaries and colleges, and\r\nthose of the Sorbonne and Navarre. Add to these the last sweep of the\r\nbroom: under the Legislative Assembly the division of all communal\r\nproperty, except woods: under the Convention, the abolition of all\r\nliterary societies, academies of science and of literature, the\r\nconfiscation of all their property, their libraries, museums, and\r\nbotanical gardens; the confiscation of all communal possessions\r\nnot previously divided; and the confiscation of all the property of\r\nhospitals and other philanthropic establishments.[2258]--The abstract\r\nprinciple, proclaimed by the Constituent Assembly, reveals, by degrees,\r\nits exterminating virtues. France now, owing to it, contains nothing but\r\ndispersed, powerless, ephemeral individuals, and confronting them,\r\nthe State, the sole, the only permanent body that has devoured all\r\nthe others, a veritable Colossus, alone erect in the midst of these\r\ninsignificant dwarfs.\r\n\r\nSubstituted for the others, it is henceforth to perform their duties,\r\nand spend the money well which they have expended badly.--In the first\r\nplace, it abolishes tithes, not gradually and by means of a process of\r\nredemption, as in England, but at one stroke, and with no indemnity,\r\non the ground that the tax, being an abusive, illegitimate impost, a\r\nprivate tax levied by individuals in cowl and cassock on others in\r\nsmock frocks, is a vexatious usurpation, and resembles the feudal\r\ndues. It is a radical operation, and in conformity with principle.\r\nUnfortunately, the puerility of the thing is so gross as to defeat its\r\nown object. In effect, since the days of Charlemagne, all the estates\r\nin the country which have been sold and resold over and over again\r\nhave always paid tithes, and have never been purchased except with this\r\ncharge upon them, which amounts to about one-seventh of the net revenue\r\nof the country. Take off this tax and one-seventh is added to the\r\nincome of the proprietor, and, consequently, a seventh to his capital. A\r\npresent is made to him of one hundred francs if his land is worth seven\r\nhundred-francs, and of one thousand if it is worth seven thousand,\r\nof ten thousand if it is worth seventy thousand, and of one hundred\r\nthousand if it is worth seven hundred thousand. Some people gain six\r\nhundred thousand francs by this act, and thirty thousand francs in\r\nIncome.[2259] Through this gratuitous and unexpected gift, one hundred\r\nand twenty-three millions of revenue, and two milliards and a half of\r\ncapital, is divided among the holders of real estate in France, and in\r\na manner so ingenious that the rich receive the most. Such is the effect\r\nof abstract principles. To afford a relief of thirty millions a year\r\nto the peasants in wooden shoes, an assembly of democrats adds thirty\r\nmillions a year to the revenue of wealthy bourgeois and thirty millions\r\na year to opulent nobles. The first part of this operation moreover, is\r\nbut another burden to the State; for, in taking off the load from\r\nthe holders of real property, it has encumbered itself, the State\r\nhenceforth, without pocketing a penny, being obliged to defray the\r\nexpenses of worship in their place.--As to the second part of the\r\noperation, which consists in the confiscation of four milliards of real\r\nestate, it proves, after all, to be ruinous, although promising to\r\nbe lucrative. It makes the same impression on our statesmen that the\r\ninheritance of a great estate makes on a needy and fanciful upstart.\r\nRegarding it as a bottomless well of gold, he draws upon it without\r\nstint and strives to realize all his fancies; as he can afford to pay\r\nfor it all, he is free to smash it all. It is thus that the Assembly\r\nsuppresses and compensates magisterial offices to the amount of four\r\nhundred and fifty millions; financial securities and obligations to the\r\namount of three hundred and twenty-one millions; the household charges\r\nof the King, Queen, and princes, fifty-two millions; military services\r\nand encumbrances, thirty-five millions; enfeoffed tithes, one hundred\r\nmillions, and so on.[2260] \"In the month of May, 1789,\" says Necker,\r\n\"the re-establishment of order in the finances were mere child's-play.\"\r\nAt the end of a year, by dint of involving itself in debt, by increasing\r\nits expenses, and by abolishing or abandoning its income, the State\r\nlives now on the paper-currency it issues, eats up its capital, and\r\nrapidly marches onward to bankruptcy. Never was such a vast inheritance\r\nso quickly reduced to nothing, and to less than nothing.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we can demonstrate, from the first few months, what use the\r\nadministrators will be able to make of it, and the manner in which\r\nthey will endow the service to which it binds them.--No portion of this\r\nconfiscated property is reserved for the maintenance of public worship,\r\nor to keep up the hospitals, asylums, and schools. Not only do all\r\nobligations and all productive real property find their way into the\r\ngreat national crucible to be converted into assignats[2261], but a\r\nnumber of special buildings, all monastic real estate and a portion\r\nof the ecclesiastical real estate, diverted from its natural course,\r\nbecomes swallowed up in the same gulf. At Besançon,[2262] three churches\r\nout of eight, with their land and treasure, the funds of the chapter,\r\nall the money of the monastic churches, the sacred vessels, shrines,\r\ncrosses, reliquaries, votive offerings, ivories, statues, pictures,\r\ntapestry, sacerdotal dresses and ornaments, plate, jewels and precious\r\nfurniture, libraries, railings, bells, masterpieces of art and of piety,\r\nall are broken up and melted in the Mint, or sold by auction for almost\r\nnothing. This is the way in which the intentions of the founders and\r\ndonors are carried out.--How are so many communities, which are deprived\r\nof their rentals, to support their schools, hospices, and asylums? Even\r\nafter the decree[2263] which, exceptionally and provisionally, orders\r\nthe whole of their revenue to be accounted for to them, will it be paid\r\nover now that it is collected by a local administration whose coffers\r\nare always empty, and whose intentions are almost always hostile? Every\r\nestablishment for benevolent and educational purposes is evidently\r\nsinking, now that the special streams which nourished them run into and\r\nare lost in the dry bed of the public treasury.[2264] Already, in 1790,\r\nthere are no funds with which to pay the monks and nuns their small\r\npensions for their maintenance. In Franche-Comté the Capuchins of Baume\r\nhave no bread, and, to live, they are obliged to re-sell, with the\r\nconsent of the district, a portion of the stores of their monastery\r\nwhich had been confiscated. The Ursuline nuns of Ornans live on the\r\nmeans furnished them by private individuals in order to keep up the only\r\nschool which the town possesses. The Bernardine nuns of Pontarlier are\r\nreduced to the lowest stage of want: \"We are satisfied,\" the district\r\nreports, \"that they have nothing to put into their mouths. We have\r\nto contribute something every day amongst ourselves to keep them\r\nfrom starving.\"[2265] Only too thankful are they when the local\r\nadministration gives them something to eat, or allows others to give\r\nthem something. In many places it strives to famish them, or takes\r\ndelight in annoying them. In March, 1791, the department of Doubs, in\r\nspite of the entreaties of the district, reduces the pension of the\r\nVisitant nuns to one hundred and one livres for the choristers, and\r\nfifty for the lay-sisters. Two months before this, the municipality of\r\nBesançon, putting its own interpretation on the decree which allowed\r\nnuns to dress as they pleased, enjoins them all, including even the\r\nsisters of charity, to abandon their old costume, which few among them\r\nhad the means of replacing.--Helplessness, indifference, or malevolence,\r\nsuch are the various dispositions which are encountered among the new\r\nauthorities whose duty it is to support and protect them. To let loose\r\npersecution there is now only needed a decree which puts the civil power\r\nin conflict with religious convictions. That decree is promulgated,\r\nand, on the 12th of July, 1790, the Assembly establishes the civil\r\nconstitution of the clergy.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the confiscation of ecclesiastical property, and\r\nthe dispersion of the monastic communities, the main body of the\r\necclesiastical corps remains intact: seventy thousand priests\r\nranged under the bishops, with the Pope in the center as the\r\ncommander-in-chief. There is no corporation more solid, more\r\nincompatible, or more attacked. For, against it are opposed implacable\r\nhatreds and fixed opinions: the Gallicanism of the jurists who, from\r\nSt. Louis downwards, are the adversaries of ecclesiastical power; the\r\ndoctrine of the Jansenists who, since Louis XIII., desire to bring back\r\nthe Church to its primitive form; and the theory of the philosophers\r\nwho, for sixty years, have considered Christianity as a mistake and\r\nCatholicism as a scourge. At the very least the institution of a clergy\r\nin Catholicism is condemned, and they think that they are moderate if\r\nthey respect the rest.\r\n\r\n\"WE MIGHT CHANGE THE RELIGION,\"\r\n\r\nsay the deputies in the tribune.[2266] Now, the decree affects\r\nneither dogma nor worship; it is confined to a revision of matters of\r\ndiscipline, and on this particular domain which is claimed for the\r\ncivil power, it is pretended that demolition and re-construction may\r\nbe effected at discretion without the concurrence of the ecclesiastical\r\npower.\r\n\r\nHere there is an abuse of power, for an ecclesiastical as well as civil\r\nsociety has the right to choose its own form, its own hierarchy, its own\r\ngovernment.--On this point, every argument that can be advanced in favor\r\nof the former can be repeated in favor of the latter, and the moment one\r\nbecomes legitimate the other becomes legitimate also. The justification\r\nfor a civil or of a religious community or society may be the\r\nperformance of a long series of services which, for centuries, it has\r\nrendered to its members, the zeal and success with which it discharges\r\nits functions, the feelings of gratitude they entertain for it, the\r\nimportance they attribute to its offices, the need they have of it, and\r\ntheir attachment to it, the conviction imprinted in their minds that\r\nwithout it they would be deprived of a benefit upon which they set more\r\nstore than upon any other. This benefit, in a civil society, is the\r\nsecurity of persons and property. In the religious society it is\r\nthe eternal salvation of the soul. iii In all other particulars the\r\nresemblance is complete, and the titles of the Church are as good as\r\nthose of the State. Hence, if it be just for one to be sovereign and\r\nfree on its own domain, it is just for the other to be equally sovereign\r\nand free, If the Church encroaches when it assumes to regulate the\r\nconstitution of the State, then the State also encroaches when it\r\npretends to regulate the constitution of the Church. If the former\r\nclaims the respect of the latter on its domain, the latter must show\r\nequal respect for the former on its ground. The boundary-line between\r\nthe two territories is, undoubtedly, not clearly defined and frequent\r\ncontests arise between the two. Sometimes these may be forestalled or\r\nterminated by each shutting itself up within a wall of separation, and\r\nby their remaining as much as possible indifferent to each other, as\r\nis the case in America. At another, they may, by a carefully considered\r\ncontract,[2267] each accord to the other specific rights on the\r\nintermediate zone, and both exercise their divided authority on that\r\nzone, which is the case in France. In both cases, however, the two\r\npowers, like the two societies, must remain distinct. It is necessary\r\nfor each of them that the other should be an equal, and not a\r\nsubordinate to which it prescribes conditions. Whatever the civil system\r\nmay be, whether monarchical or republican, oligarchic or democratic, the\r\nChurch abuses its credit when it condemns or attacks it. Whatever may be\r\nthe ecclesiastical system, whether papal, Episcopalian, Presbyterian, or\r\ncongregational, the State abuses its strength when, without the assent\r\nof the faithful, it abolishes their systems or imposes a new one upon\r\nthem. Not only does it violate right, but its violence, most frequently,\r\nis fruitless. It may strike as it will, the root of the tree is beyond\r\nits reach, and, in the unjust war which it wages against an institution\r\nas vital as itself, it often ends in getting the worst of it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Assembly, in this as in other matters, being\r\npreoccupied with principles, fails to look at practical facts; and,\r\naiming to remove only the dead bark, it injures the living trunk.--For\r\nmany centuries, and especially since the Council of Trent, the vigorous\r\nelement of Catholicism is much less religion itself than the Church.\r\nTheology has retired into the background, while discipline has come\r\nto the front. Believers who, according to Church law, are required to\r\nregard spiritual authority as dogma, in fact attach their faith to the\r\nspiritual authority much more than to the dogma.--\r\n\r\nCatholic Faith insists, in relation to discipline as well as to dogma,\r\nthat if one rejects the decision of the Roman Church one ceases to be a\r\nCatholic; that the constitution of the Church is monarchical, that the\r\nordaining of priests and bishops is made from above so that without\r\ncommunion with the Pope, its supreme head, one is schismatic and that no\r\nschismatic priest legitimately can perform a holy service, and that no\r\ntrue faithful may attend his service or receive his blessings without\r\ncommitting a sin.--It is a fact that the faithful, apart from a few\r\nJansenists, are neither theologians nor canonists; that they read\r\nneither prayers nor scriptures, and if they accept the creed, it is in\r\na lump, without investigation, confiding in the hand which presents it;\r\nthat their obedient conscience is in the keeping of this pastoral guide;\r\nthat the Church of the third century is of little consequence to them;\r\nand that, as far as the true form of the actual Church goes, the doctor\r\nwhose advice they follow is not St. Cyprian, of whom they know nothing,\r\nbut their visible bishop and their living curé. Put these two premises\r\ntogether and the conclusion is self-evident: it is clear that they will\r\nnot believe that they are baptized, absolved, or married except by this\r\ncuré authorized by this bishop. Let others be put in their places\r\nwhom they condemn, and you suppress worship, sacraments, and the most\r\nprecious functions of spiritual life to twenty-four millions of French\r\npeople, to all the peasantry, all the children, and to almost all the\r\nwomen; you stir up in rebellion against you the two greatest forces\r\nwhich move the mind, conscience and habit.--And observe the result of\r\nthis. You not only convert the State into a policeman in the service\r\nof heresy, but also, through this fruitless and tyrannous attempt of\r\nGallican Jansenism, you bring into permanent discredit Gallican maxims\r\nand Jansenist doctrines. You cut away the last two roots by which a\r\nliberal sentiment still vegetated in orthodox Catholicism. You throw the\r\nclergy back on Rome; you attach them to the Pope from whom you wish to\r\nseparate them, and deprive them of the national character which you\r\nwish to impose on them. They were French, and you render them\r\nUltramontane.[2268] They excited ill-will and envy, and you render them\r\nsympathetic and popular. They were a divided body, and you give them\r\nunanimity. They were a straggling militia, scattered about under several\r\nindependent authorities, and rooted to the soil through the possession\r\nof the ground; thanks to you, they are to become a regular, manageable\r\narmy, emancipated from every local attachment, organized under one head,\r\nand always prepared to take the field at the word of command. Compare\r\nthe authority of a bishop in his diocese in 1789 with that of a bishop\r\nsixty years later. In 1789, the Archbishop of Besançon, out of fifteen\r\nhundred offices and benefices, had the patronage of one hundred, In\r\nninety-three incumbencies the selections were made by the metropolitan\r\nchapter; in eighteen it was made by the chapter of the Madeleine;\r\nin seventy parishes by the noble founder or benefactor. One abbé had\r\nthirteen incumbencies at his disposal, another thirty-four, another\r\nthirty-five, a prior nine, an abbess twenty; five communes directly\r\nnominated their own pastor, while abbeys, priories and canonries were in\r\nthe hands of the King.[2269] At the present day (1880) in a diocese the\r\nbishop appoints all the curés or officiating priests, and may deprive\r\nnine out of ten of them; in the diocese above named, from 1850 to\r\n1860, scarcely one lay functionary was nominated without the consent or\r\nintervention of the cardinal-archbishop.[2270] To comprehend the spirit,\r\ndiscipline, and influence of our contemporary clergy, go back to the\r\nsource of it, and you will find it in the decree of the Constituent\r\nAssembly. A natural organization cannot be broken up with impunity; it\r\nforms anew, adapting itself to circumstances, and closes up its ranks in\r\nproportion to its danger.\r\n\r\nBut even if, according to the maxims of the Assembly, faith and worship\r\nare free, as far as the sovereign State is concerned, the churches are\r\nsubjects.--For these are societies, administrations, and hierarchies,\r\nand no society, administration, or hierarchy may exist in the State\r\nwithout entering into its--departments under the title of subordinate,\r\ndelegate, or employee. A priest is now essentially a salaried officer\r\nlike the rest, a functionary[2271] presiding over matters pertaining to\r\nworship and morality. If the State is disposed to change the number, the\r\nmode of nomination, the duties and the posts of its engineers, it is not\r\nbound to assemble its engineers and ask their permission, least of all\r\nthat of a foreign engineer established at Rome. If it wishes to change\r\nthe condition of \"its ecclesiastical officers,\" its right to do so\r\nis the same, and therefore unquestioned. There is no need of asking\r\nanybody's consent in the exercise of this right, and it allows no\r\ninterference between it and its clerks. The Assembly refuses to call a\r\nGallican council; it refuses to negotiate with the Pope, and, on its\r\nown authority alone, it recasts the whole Constitution of the Church.\r\nHenceforth this branch of the public administration is to be organized\r\non the model of the others.--In the first place[2272] the diocese is to\r\nbe in extent and limits the same as the French department; consequently,\r\nall ecclesiastical districts are marked out anew, and forty-eight\r\nepiscopal sees disappear.--In the second place, the appointed bishop is\r\nforbidden \"to refer to the Pope to obtain any confirmation whatever.\"\r\nAll he can do is to write to him \"in testimony of the unity of faith and\r\nof the communion which he is to maintain with him.\" The bishop is thus\r\nno longer installed by his canonical chief, and the Church of France\r\nbecomes schismatic.--In the third place, the metropolitan or bishop is\r\nforbidden to exact from the new bishops or curés \"any oath other than\r\nthat they profess the Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman religion.\" Assisted\r\nby his council he may examine them on their doctrine and morals, and\r\nrefuse them canonical installation, but in this case his reasons must\r\nbe given in writing, and he signed by himself and his council. His\r\nauthority, in other respects, does not extend beyond this for it is the\r\ncivil tribunal which decides between contending parties. Thus is the\r\ncatholic hierarchy broken up; the ecclesiastical superior has his hands\r\ntied; if he still delegates sacerdotal functions it is only as a matter\r\nof form. Between the curé and the bishop subordination ceases to exist\r\njust as it has ceased to exist between the bishop and the Pope, and\r\nthe Church of France becomes Presbyterian.--The people now, in effect,\r\nchoose their own ministers, as they do in the Presbyterian church; the\r\nbishop is appointed by the electors of the department, the cure by the\r\ndistrict electors, and, what is an extraordinary aggravation, these need\r\nnot be of his communion. It is of no consequence whether the electoral\r\nAssembly contains, as at Nîmes, Montauban, Strasbourg, and Metz, a\r\nnotable proportion of Calvinists, Lutherans, and Jews, or whether its\r\nmajority, furnished by the club, is notoriously hostile to Catholicism,\r\nand even to Christianity itself. The bishop and the curé must be chosen\r\nby the electoral body; the Holy Ghost dwells with it, and with the\r\ncivil tribunals, and these may install its elect in spite of any\r\nresistance.--To complete the dependence of the clergy, every bishop is\r\nforbidden to absent himself more than fifteen days without permission\r\nfrom the department; every curé the same length of time without the\r\npermission of the district, even to attend upon a dying father or to\r\nundergo the operation of lithotomy. In default of this permission his\r\nsalary is suspended: as a functionary under salary, he owes all his time\r\nto his bureau, and if he desires a leave of absence he must ask for\r\nit from his chiefs in the Hôtel-de-Ville.[2273]--He must assent to all\r\nthese innovations, not only with passive obedience, but by a solemn\r\noath. All old or new ecclesiastics, archbishops, bishops, curés, vicars,\r\npreachers, hospital and prison chaplains, superiors and directors of\r\nseminaries, professors of seminaries and colleges, are to state in\r\nwriting that they are ready to take this oath: moreover, they must take\r\nit publicly, in church, \"in the presence of the general council, the\r\ncommune, and the faithful,\" and promise \"to maintain with all their\r\npower\" a schismatic and Presbyterian Church.--For there can be no doubt\r\nabout the sense and bearing of the prescribed oath. It was all very\r\nwell to incorporate it with a broader one, that of maintaining the\r\nConstitution. But the Constitution of the clergy is too clearly\r\ncomprised in the general Constitution, like a chapter in a book, and to\r\nsign the book is to sign the chapter. Besides, in the formula to which\r\nthe ecclesiastics in the Assembly are obliged to swear in the tribune,\r\nthe chapter is precisely indicated, and no exception or reservation is\r\nallowed.[2274] The Bishop of Clermont, with all those who have accepted\r\nthe Constitution in full, save the decrees affecting spiritual matters,\r\nare silenced. Where the spiritual begins and where it ends the Assembly\r\nknows better than they, for it has defined this, and it imposes its\r\ndefinition on canonist and theologian; it is, in its turn, the Pope, and\r\nall consciences must bow to its decision. Let them take the \"oath, pure\r\nand simple,\" or if they do not they are 'refractory.\" The fiat goes\r\nforth, and the effect of it is immense, for, along with the clergy, the\r\nlaw reaches to laymen. On the one hand, all the ecclesiastics who refuse\r\nthe oath are dismissed. If they continue \"to interfere with public\r\nfunctions which they have personally or corporately exercised\" they\r\n\"shall be prosecuted as disturbers of the peace, and condemned as\r\nrebels against the law,\" deprived of all rights as active citizens,\r\nand declared incompetent to hold any public office. This is the penalty\r\nalready inflicted on the nonjuring bishop who persists in considering\r\nhimself a bishop, who ordains priests and who issues a pastoral letter.\r\nSuch is soon to be the penalty inflicted on the nonjuring curé who\r\npresumes to hear confession or officiate at a mass.[2275] On the other\r\nhand, all citizens who refuse to take the prescribed oath, all electors,\r\nmunicipal officers, judges and administrative agents, shall lose\r\ntheir right of suffrage, have their functions revoked, and be declared\r\nincompetent for all public duties.[2276] The result is that scrupulous\r\nCatholics are excluded from every administrative post, from all\r\nelections, and especially from ecclesiastical elections; from which\r\nit follows that, the stronger one's faith the less one's share in the\r\nchoice of a priest.[2277]--What an admirable law, that which, under the\r\npretext of doing away with ecclesiastical abuses, places the faithful,\r\nlay or clerical, outside the pale of the law!\r\n\r\nThis soon becomes apparent. One hundred and thirty four archbishops,\r\nbishops, and coadjutors refuse to take the oath; there are only four\r\nof them who do so, three of whom, MM. de Talleyrand, de Jarente, and\r\nde Brienne, are unbelievers and notorious for their licentiousness; the\r\nothers are influenced by their consciences, above all, by their esprit\r\nde corps and a point of honor. Most of the curés rally around this staff\r\nof officers. In the diocese of Besançon,[2278] out of fourteen hundred\r\npriests, three hundred take the oath, a thousand refuse it, and eighty\r\nretract. In the department of Doubs, only four consent to swear. In the\r\ndepartment of Lozère, there are only \"ten out of two hundred and fifty.\"\r\nIt is stated positively,\" writes the best informed of all observers that\r\neverywhere in France two-thirds of the ecclesiastics have refused the\r\noath, or have only taken it with the same reservations as the Bishop of\r\nClermont.\"\r\n\r\nThus, out of seventy thousand priests, forty-six thousand are turned\r\nout of office, and the majority of their parishioners are on their side.\r\nThis is apparent in the absence of electors convoked to replace them:\r\nat Bordeaux only four hundred and fifty came to the poll out of nine\r\nhundred, while elsewhere the summons brings together only \"a third or\r\na quarter\" In many places there are no candidates, or those elected\r\ndecline to accept. They are obliged, in order to supply their places,\r\nto hunt up unfrocked monks of a questionable character. There are two\r\nparties, after this, in each parish; two faiths, two systems of\r\nworship, and permanent discord. Even when the new and the old curés are\r\naccommodating, their situations bring them into conflict. To the former\r\nthe latter are \"intruders.\" To the latter the former are \"refractories.\"\r\nBy virtue of his being a guardian of souls, the former cannot dispense\r\nwith telling his parishioners that the intruder is excommunicated, that\r\nhis sacraments are null or sacrilegious, and that it is a sin to attend\r\nhis mass. By virtue of his being a public functionary, the latter does\r\nnot fail to write to the authorities that the \"refractory\" entraps the\r\nfaithful, excites their consciences, saps the Constitution, and that\r\nhe ought to be put down by force. In other words, the former draws\r\neverybody away from the latter, while the latter sends the gendarmes\r\nagainst the former, and persecution begins.--In a strange reversal,\r\nit is the majority which undergoes persecution, and the minority which\r\ncarries it out. The mass of the constitutional curé is, everywhere,\r\ndeserted.[2279] In La Vendée there are ten or twelve present in the\r\nchurch out of five or six hundred parishioners; on Sundays and holidays\r\nwhole villages and market-towns travel from one to two leagues off to\r\nattend the orthodox mass, the villagers declaring that \"if the old curé\r\ncan only be restored to them, they will gladly pay a double tax.\" In\r\nAlsace, \"nine tenths, at least, of the Catholics refuse to recognize\r\nthe legally sworn priests.\" The same spectacle presents itself in\r\nFranche-Comté, Artois, and in ten of the other provinces.--Finally, as\r\nin a chemical composition, the analysis is complete. Those who believe,\r\nor who recover their belief, are ranged around the old curé; all who,\r\nthrough conviction or tradition, hold to the sacraments, all who,\r\nthrough faith or habit, wish or feel a need to attend the mass. The\r\nauditors of the new curé consist of unbelievers, deists, the indifferent\r\nmembers of the clubs and of the administration, who resort to the church\r\nas to the Hôtel-de-ville or to a popular meeting, not through religious\r\nbut through political zeal, and who support the \"intruder\" in order to\r\nsustain the Constitution. All this does not secure to him very fervent\r\nfollowers, but it provides him with very zealous defenders; and, in\r\ndefault of the faith which they do not possess, they give the force\r\nwhich is at their disposal. All means are proper against an intractable\r\nbishop or curé; not only the law which they aggravate through their\r\nforced interpretation of it and through their arbitrary verdicts, but\r\nalso the riots which they stir up by their instigation and which they\r\nsanction by their toleration.[2280] He is driven out of his parish,\r\nconsigned to the county town, and kept in a safe place. The Directory of\r\nAisne denounces him as a disturber of the public peace, and forbids\r\nhim, under severe penalties, from administering the sacraments. The\r\nmunicipality of Cahors shuts up particular churches and orders the\r\nnonjuring ecclesiastics to leave the town in twenty-four hours. The\r\nelectoral corps of Lot denounces them publicly as \"ferocious brutes,\"\r\nincendiaries, and provokers of civil war. The Directory of the Bas-Rhin\r\nbanishes them to Strasbourg or to fifteen leagues from the frontier.\r\nAt Saint-Leon the bishop is forced to fly. At Auch the archbishop is\r\nimprisoned; at Lyons M. de Boisboissel, grand vicar, is confined in\r\nPierre-Encize, for having preserved an archiepiscopal mandate in his\r\nhouse; brutality is everywhere the minister of intolerance. A certain\r\ncure of Aisne who, in 1789, had fed two thousand poor, having presumed\r\nto read from his pulpit a pastoral charge concerning the observance of\r\nLent, the mayor seizes him by the collar and prevents him from going to\r\nthe altar; \"two of the National Yeomanry\" draw their sabers on him, and\r\nforthwith lead him away bareheaded, not allowing him to return to his\r\nhouse, and drive him to a distance of two leagues by beat of drum and\r\nunder escort. At Paris, in the church of Saint-Eustache, the curé is\r\ngreeted with outcries, a pistol is pointed at his head, he is seized by\r\nthe hair, struck with fists, and only reaches the sacristy through\r\nthe intervention of the National Guard. In the church of the Théatins,\r\nrented by the orthodox with all legal formality, a furious band\r\ndisperses the priests and their assistants, upsets the altar and\r\nprofanes the sacred vessels. A placard, posted up by the department,\r\ncalls upon the people to respect the law, \"I saw it,\" says an\r\neye-witness, \"torn down amidst imprecations against the department, the\r\npriests, and the devout. One of the chief haranguers, standing on the\r\nsteps terminated his speech by stating that schism ought to be stopped\r\nat any cost, that no worship but his should be allowed, that women\r\nshould be whipped and priests knocked on the head.\" And, in fact, \"a\r\nyoung lady accompanied by her mother is whipped on the steps of\r\nthe church.\" Elsewhere nuns are the sufferers, even the sisters of\r\nSaint-Vincent de Paul; and, from April, 1793, onward; the same outrages\r\non modesty and against life are propagated from town to town. At Dijon,\r\nrods are nailed fast to the gates of all the convents; at Montpellier,\r\ntwo or three hundred ruffians, armed with large iron--bound sticks,\r\nmurder the men and outrage the women.--Nothing remains but to put\r\nthe gangsters under the shelter of an amnesty, which is done by the\r\nConstituent Assembly, and to legally sanction the animosity of local\r\nadministrations, which is done by the Legislative Assembly.[2281]\r\nHenceforth the nonjuring ecclesiastics are deprived of their sustenance;\r\nthey are declared \"suspected of revolt against the law and of evil\r\nintentions against the country.\"--Thus, says a contemporary Protestant,\r\n\"on the strength of these suspicions and these intentions, a Directory,\r\nto which the law interdicts judicial functions, may arbitrarily drive\r\nout of his house the minister of a God of peace and charity, grown gray\r\nin the shadow of the altar\" Thus, \"everywhere, where disturbances occur\r\non account of religious opinions, and whether these troubles are due\r\nto the frantic scourgers of the virtuous sisters of charity or to the\r\nruffians armed with cow-hides who, at Nîmes and Montpellier, outrage all\r\nthe laws of decorum and of liberty for six whole months, the non-juring\r\npriests are to be punished with banishment. Torn from their families\r\nwhose means of living they share, they are sent away to wander on the\r\nhighways, abandoned to public pity or ferocity the moment any scoundrel\r\nchooses to excite a disturbance that he can impute to them.\"--Thus we\r\nsee approaching the revolt of the peasantry, the insurrections of Nîmes,\r\nFranche-Comté, la Vendée and Brittany, emigration, transportation;\r\nimprisonment, the guillotine or drowning for two thirds of the clergy of\r\nFrance, and likewise for myriads of the loyal, for husbandmen, artisans,\r\nday-laborers, seamstresses, and servants, and the humblest among the\r\nlower class of the people. This is what the laws of the Constituent\r\nAssembly are leading to.--In the institution of the clergy, as in that\r\nof the nobles and the King, it demolished a solid wall in order to\r\ndig through it an open door, and it is nothing strange if the whole\r\nstructure tumbles down on the heads of its inmates. The true course was\r\nto respect, to reform, to utilize rank and corporations: all that the\r\nAssembly thought of was the abolition of these in the name of abstract\r\nequality and of national sovereignty. In order to abolish these it\r\nexecuted, tolerated, or initiated all the attacks on persons and on\r\nproperty. Those it is about to commit are the inevitable result of those\r\nwhich it has already committed; for, through its Constitution, bad is\r\nchanged to worse, and the social edifice, already half in ruins through\r\nthe clumsy havoc that is effected in it, will fall in completely under\r\nthe weight of the incongruous or extravagant constructions which it\r\nproceeds to extemporize.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2201: Cf. \"The Ancient Régime,\" books I. and V.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2202: Perhaps we are here at the core of why all regimes end\r\nup becoming corrupt, inefficient and sick; their leaders take their\r\nprivileges for granted and become more and more inattentive to the work\r\nwhich must be done if the people are to be kept at work and possible\r\nadversaries kept under control.

THE CONSTRUCTIONS--THE CONSTITUTION OF 1791.\r\n\r\nThat which is called a Government is a concert of powers, each with a\r\ndistinct function, and all working towards a final and complete end. The\r\nmerit of a Government consists in the attainment of this end; the worth\r\nof a machine depends upon the work it accomplishes. The important thing\r\nis not to produce a good mechanical design on paper, but to see that the\r\nmachine works well when set up on the ground. In vain might its founders\r\nallege the beauty of their plan and the logical connection of their\r\ntheorems; they are not required to furnish either plan or theorems, but\r\nan instrument.\r\n\r\nTwo conditions are requisite to render this instrument serviceable and\r\neffective. In the first place, the public powers must harmonize with\r\neach other, if not, one will neutralize the other; in the second place\r\nthey must be obeyed, or they are null.\r\n\r\nThe Constituent Assembly made no provision for securing this harmony\r\nor this obedience. In the machine which it constructed the motions all\r\ncounteract each other; the impulse is not transmitted; the gearing is\r\nnot complete between the center and the extremities; the large central\r\nand upper wheels turn to no purpose; the innumerable small wheels near\r\nthe ground break or get out of order: the machine, by virtue of its own\r\nmechanism, remains useless, over-heated, under clouds of waste steam,\r\ncreaking and thumping in such a matter as to show clearly that it must\r\nexplode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--Powers of the Central Government.\r\n\r\n     The Assembly on the partition of power.--Rupture of every\r\n     tie between the Legislature and the King.--The Assembly on\r\n     the subordination of the executive power.--How this is\r\n     nullified.--Certainty of a conflict.--The deposition of the\r\n     King is inevitable.\r\n\r\nLet us first consider the two central powers, the Assembly and\r\nthe King.--Ordinarily when distinct powers of different origin are\r\nestablished by a Constitution, it makes, in the case of conflict between\r\nthem, a provision for an arbiter in the institution of an Upper Chamber.\r\nEach of these powers, at least, has a hold on the other. The Assembly\r\nmust have one on the King: which is the right to refuse taxation. The\r\nKing must have one on the Assembly: which is the right of dissolving it.\r\nOtherwise, one of the two being disarmed, the other becomes omnipotent,\r\nand, consequently, insane. The peril here is as great for an omnipotent\r\nAssembly as it is for an absolute King. If the former is desirous of\r\nremaining in its right mind, it needs repression and control as much\r\nas the latter. If it is proper for the Assembly to restrain the King\r\nby refusing him subsidies, it is proper for him to be able to defend\r\nhimself by appealing to the electors.--But, besides these extreme\r\nmeasures, which are dangerous and rarely resorted to, there is another\r\nwhich is ordinarily employed and is safe, that is, the right for the\r\nKing to take his ministers from the Chamber. Generally, the leaders\r\nof the majority form the ministry, their nomination being the means of\r\nrestoring harmony between the King and Assembly; they are at once men\r\nbelonging to the Assembly and men belonging to the King. Through this\r\nexpedient not only is the confidence of the Assembly assured, since the\r\nGovernment remains in the hands of its leaders, but also it is under\r\nrestraint because these become simultaneously both powerful and\r\nresponsible. Placed at the head of all branches of the service, they\r\nare, before proposing it or accepting it, in a position to judge whether\r\na law is useful and practicable. Nothing is so healthy for a majority\r\nas a ministry composed of its own chiefs; nothing is so effective in\r\nrepressing rashness or intemperance. A railway conductor is not willing\r\nthat his locomotive should be deprived of coal, nor to have the rails he\r\nis about to run on broken up.--This arrangement, with all its drawbacks\r\nand inconveniences, is the best one yet arrived at by human experience\r\nfor the security of societies against despotism and anarchy. For the\r\nabsolute power which establishes or saves them may also oppress or\r\nexhaust them, there is a gradual substitution of differentiated powers,\r\nheld together through the mediation of a third umpire, caused by\r\nreciprocal dependence and an which is common to both.\r\n\r\nExperience, however, is unimportant to the members of the Constituent\r\nAssembly; under the banner of principles they sunder one after another\r\nall the ties which keep the two powers together harmoniously.--There\r\nmust not be an Upper Chamber, because this would be an asylum or a\r\nnursery for aristocrats. Moreover, \"the nation being of one mind,\" it\r\nis averse to \"the creation of different organs.\" So, applying ready-made\r\nformulas and metaphors, they continue to produce ideological definitions\r\nand distinctions.\r\n\r\nThe King must not have a hold on the legislative body: the executive\r\nis an arm, whose business it is to obey; it is absurd for the arm to\r\nconstrain or direct the head. Scarcely is the monarch allowed a delaying\r\nveto. Sieyès here enters with his protest declaring that this is a\r\n\"lettre de cachet[2301] launched against the universal will,\" and\r\nthere is excluded from the action of the veto the articles of the\r\nConstitution, all money-bills, and some other laws.--Neither the monarch\r\nnor the electors of the Assembly are to convoke the Assembly; he has no\r\nvoice in or oversight of the details of its formation; the electors are\r\nto meet together and vote without his summons or supervision. Once the\r\nAssembly is elected he can neither adjourn nor dissolve it. He cannot\r\neven propose a law;[2302] per-mission is only granted to him \"to invite\r\nit to take a subject into consideration.\" He is limited to his executive\r\nduties; and still more, a sort of wall is built up between him and the\r\nAssembly, and the opening in it, by which each could take the other's\r\nhand, is carefully closed up. The deputies are forbidden to become\r\nministers throughout the term of their service and for two years\r\nafterwards. This is because fears are entertained that they might\r\nbe corrupted through contact with the Court, and, again, whoever\r\nthe ministers might be, there is no disposition to accept their\r\nascendancy.[2303] If one of them is admitted into the Assembly it is not\r\nfor the purpose of giving advice, but to furnish information, reply to\r\ninterrogatories, and make protestations of his zeal in humble terms\r\nand in a dubious position.[2304] By virtue of being a royal agent he\r\nis under suspicion like the King himself, and he is sequestered in his\r\nbureau as the King is sequestered in his palace.--Such is the spirit\r\nof the Constitution: by force of the theory, and the better to secure a\r\nseparation of the powers,[2305] a common understanding between them\r\nis for ever rendered impossible, and to make up for this impossibility\r\nthere remains nothing but to make one the master and the other the\r\nclerk.\r\n\r\nThis they did not fail to do, and for greater security, the latter\r\nis made an honorary clerk, The executive power is conferred on him\r\nnominally and in appearance; he does not possess it in fact, care having\r\nbeen taken to place it in other hands.--In effect, all executive agents\r\nand all secondary and local powers are elective. The King has no voice,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, in the choice of judges, public prosecutors,\r\nbishops, curés, collectors and assessors of the taxes, commissaries of\r\npolice, district and departmental administrators, mayors, and municipal\r\nofficers. At most, should an administrator violate a law, he may annul\r\nhis acts and suspend him; but the Assembly, the superior power, has the\r\nright to cancel this suspension.--As to the armed force, of which he is\r\nsupposed to be the commander-in-chief, this escapes from him entirely:\r\nthe National Guard is not to receive orders from him; the gendarmerie\r\nand the troops are bound to respond to the requisitions of the municipal\r\nauthorities, whom the King can neither select nor displace: in short,\r\nlocal action of any kind--that is to say, all effective action--is\r\ndenied to him.--The executive instrument is purposely destroyed. The\r\nconnection which existed between the wheels of the extremities and the\r\ncentral shaft is broken, and henceforth, incapable of distributing its\r\nenergy, this shaft, in the hands of the monarch, stands still or\r\nelse turns to no purpose. The King, \"supreme head of the general\r\nadministration, of the army, and of the navy, guardian of public peace\r\nand order, hereditary representative of the nation,\" is without the\r\nmeans, in spite of his lofty titles, of directly applying his pretended\r\npowers, of causing a schedule of assessments to be drawn up in a\r\nrefractory commune, of compelling payment by a delinquent tax-payer, of\r\nenforcing the free circulation of a convoy of grain, of executing\r\nthe judgment of a court, of suppressing an outbreak, or of securing\r\nprotection to persons and property. For he can bring no constraint to\r\nbear on the agents who are declared to be subordinate to him; he has\r\nno resources but those of warning and persuasion. He sends to each\r\nDepartmental Assembly the decrees which he has sanctioned, requesting\r\nit to transmit them and cause them to be carried out; he receives its\r\ncorrespondence and bestows his censure or approval--and that is all.\r\nHe is merely a powerless medium of communication, a herald or public\r\nadvertiser, a sort of central echo, sonorous and empty, to which news\r\nis brought, and from which laws depart, to spread abroad like a common\r\nrumor. Such as he is, and thus diminished, he is still considered to\r\nbe too strong. He is deprived of the right of pardon, \"which severs the\r\nlast artery of monarchical government.\"[2306] All sorts of precautions\r\nare taken against him. He cannot declare war without a decree of the\r\nAssembly; he is obliged to bring war to an end on the decree of the\r\nAssembly; he cannot make a treaty of peace, an alliance, or a commercial\r\ntreaty, without the ratification of these by the Assembly. It is\r\nexpressly declared that he is to nominate but two-thirds of the\r\nrear-admirals, one-half of the lieutenant-generals, field-marshals,\r\ncaptains of Vessels and colonels of the gendarmerie, one-third of the\r\ncolonels and lieutenant-colonels of the line, and a sixth of the naval\r\nlieutenants. He must not allow troops to stay or pass within 30,000\r\nyards of the Assembly. His guard must not consist of more than 1,800\r\nmen, duly verified, and protected against his seductions by the civil\r\noath. The heir-presumptive must not leave the country without the\r\nAssembly's assent. It is the Assembly which is to regulate by law\r\nthe education of his son during minority.--All these precautions are\r\naccompanied with threats. There are against him five possible causes\r\nof dethronement; against his responsible Ministers, eight causes for\r\ncondemnation to from twelve to twenty years of constraint, and eight\r\ngrounds for condemnations to death.[2307] Everywhere between the lines\r\nof the Constitution, we read the constant disposition to assume an\r\nattitude of defense, the secret dread of treachery, the conviction that\r\nexecutive power, of whatever kind, is in its nature inimical to the\r\npublic welfare.--For withholding the nomination of judges, the reason\r\nalleged is that \"the Court and the Ministers are the most contemptible\r\nportion of the nation.\"[2308] If the nomination of Ministers is\r\nconceded, it is on the ground that\" Ministers appointed by the people\r\nwould necessarily be too highly esteemed.\" The principle is that \"the\r\nlegislative body alone must possess the confidence of the people,\" that\r\nroyal authority corrupts its depository, and that executive power is\r\nalways tempted to commit abuses and to engage in conspiracies. If it\r\nis provided for in the Constitution it is with regret, through the\r\nnecessity of the case, and on the condition of its being trammeled by\r\nimpediments; it will prove so much the less baneful in proportion as it\r\nis restrained, guarded, threatened, and denounced.--A position of this\r\nkind is manifestly intolerable; and only a man as passive as Louis XVI.\r\ncould have put up with it. Do what he will, however, he cannot make it\r\na tenable one. In vain does he scrupulously adhere to the Constitution,\r\nand fulfill it to the letter. Because he is powerless the Assembly\r\nregards him as lukewarm, and imputes to him the friction of the machine\r\nwhich is not under his control. If he presumes once to exercise his veto\r\nit is rebellion, and the rebellion of an official against his superior,\r\nwhich is the Assembly; the rebellion of a subject against his Sovereign,\r\nwhich is the people. In this case dethronement is proper, and the\r\nAssembly has only to pass the decree; the people have simply to\r\nexecute the act, and the Constitution ends in a Revolution.--A piece\r\nof machinery of this stamp breaks down through its own movement. In\r\nconformity with the philosophic theory the two wheels of government must\r\nbe separated, and to do this they have to be disconnected and\r\nisolated one from the other. In conformity with the popular creed, the\r\ndriving-wheel must be subordinated and its influence neutralized: to\r\ndo this it is necessary to reduce its energy to a minimum, break up its\r\nconnections, and raise it up in the air to turn round like a top, or to\r\nremain there as an obstacle to something else. It is certain that,\r\nafter much ill-usage as a plaything, it will finally be removed as a\r\nhindrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--The Creation Of Popular Democracy.\r\n\r\n     Administrative powers.--The Assembly on the hierarchy.\r\n     --Grades abolished.--Collective powers.--Election introduced,\r\n     and the influence of subordinates in all branches of the\r\n     service.--Certainty of disorganization.--Power in the hands\r\n     of municipal bodies.\r\n\r\nLet us leave the center of government and go to the extremities, and\r\nobserve the various administrations in working operation.[2309]\r\n\r\nFor any service to work well and with precision, there must be a\r\nsingle and unique chief who can appoint, pay, punish and dismiss his\r\nsubordinates.--For, on the one hand, he stands alone and feels his\r\nresponsibility; he brings to bear on the management of affairs a degree\r\nof attention and consistency, a tact and a power of initiation of which\r\na committee is incapable; corporate follies or defects do not involve\r\nany one in particular, and authority is effective only when it is in one\r\nhand.--On the other hand, being master, he can rely on the subalterns\r\nwhom he has himself selected, whom he controls through their hopes\r\nor fears, and whom he discharges if they do not perform their duties;\r\notherwise he has no hold on them and they are not instruments to be\r\ndepended on. Only on these conditions can a railway manager be sure that\r\nhis pointsmen are on the job. Only on these conditions can the foreman\r\nof a foundry engage to execute work by a given day. In every public or\r\nprivate enterprise, direct, immediate authority is the only known, the\r\nonly human and possible way to ensure the obedience and punctuality of\r\nagents.--Administration is thus carried on in all countries, by one or\r\nseveral series of functionaries, each under some central manager who\r\nholds the reins in his single grasp.[2310]\r\n\r\nThis is all reversed in the new Constitution. In the eyes of our\r\nlegislators obedience must be spontaneous and never compulsory, and, in\r\nthe suppression of despotism, they suppress government. The general rule\r\nin the hierarchy which they establish is that the subordinates should be\r\nindependent of their superior, for he must neither appoint nor displace\r\nthem: the only right he has is to give them advice and remonstrate\r\nwith them.[2311] At best, in certain cases, he can annul their acts and\r\ninflict on them a provisional suspension of their functions, which can\r\nbe contested and is revocable.[2312] We see, thus, that none of the\r\nlocal powers are delegated by the central power; the latter is simply\r\nlike a man without either hands or arms, seated in a gilt chair. The\r\nMinister of the Finances cannot appoint or dismiss either an assessor or\r\na collector; the Minister of the Interior, not one of the departmental,\r\ndistrict, or communal administrators; the Minister of Justice, not one\r\njudge or public prosecutor. The King, in these three branches of the\r\nservice, has but one officer of his own, the commissioner whose duty\r\nit is to advocate the observance of the laws in the courts, and, on\r\nsentence being given, to enforce its execution.--All the muscles of\r\nthe central power are paralyzed by this stroke, and henceforth each\r\ndepartment is a State apart, living by itself.\r\n\r\nAn similar amputation, however, in the department itself, has cut\r\naway all the ties by which the superior could control and direct his\r\nsubordinate.--If the administrators of the department are suffered to\r\ninfluence those of the district, and those of the district those of the\r\nmunicipality, it is only, again, in the way of council and solicitation.\r\nNowhere is the superior a commander who orders and constrains, but\r\neverywhere a censor who gives warnings and scolds. To render this\r\nalready feeble authority still more feeble at each step of the\r\nhierarchy, it is divided among several bodies. These consist of\r\nsuperposed councils, which administer the department, the district,\r\nand the commune. There is no directing head in any of these councils.\r\nPermanency and executive functions throughout are vested in the\r\ndirectories of four or eight members, or in bureaus of two, three,\r\nfour, six, and even seven members whose elected chief, a president\r\nor mayor,[2313] has simply an honorary primacy. Decision and action,\r\neverywhere blunted, delayed, or curtailed by talk and the processes\r\nof discussion, are brought forth only after the difficult, tumultuous\r\nassent of several discordant wills.[2314] Elective and collective as\r\nthese powers are, measures are still taken to guard against them. Not\r\nonly are they subject to the control of an elected council, one-half\r\nrenewable every two years, but, again, the mayor and public prosecutor\r\nof the commune after serving four years, and the procureur-syndic of\r\nthe department or district after eight years service, and the district\r\ncollector after six years' service, are not re-elected. Should these\r\nofficials have deserved and won the confidence of the electors,\r\nshould familiarity with affairs have made them specially competent and\r\nvaluable, so much the worse for affairs and the public; they are not\r\nto be anchored to their post.[2315] Should their continuance in office\r\nintroduce into the service a spirit of order and economy, that is of no\r\nconsequence; there is danger of their acquiring to much influence, and\r\nthe law sends them off as soon as they become expert and entitled to\r\nrule.--Never has jealousy and suspicion been more on the alert against\r\npower, even legal and legitimate. Sapping and mining goes on even\r\nin services which are recognized as essential, as the army and the\r\ngendarmerie.[2316] In the army, on the appointment of a non-commissioned\r\nofficer, the other non-commissioned officers make up a list of\r\ncandidates, and the captain selects three, one of whom is chosen by\r\nthe colonel. In the choice of a sub-lieutenant, all the officers of\r\nthe regiment vote, and he who receives a majority is appointed. In the\r\ngendarmerie, for the appointment of a gendarme, the directory of the\r\ndepartment forms a list; the colonel designates five names on it,\r\nand the directory selects one of them. For the choice of a corporal,\r\nquartermaster or lieutenant, there is, besides the directory and the\r\ncolonel, another intervention, that of the officers, both commissioned\r\nand non-commissioned. It is a system of elective complications and\r\nlot-drawings; one which, giving a voice in the choice of officers to the\r\ncivil authorities and to military subordinates, leaves the colonel with\r\nonly a third or one-quarter of his former ascendancy. In relation to the\r\nNational Guard, the new principle is applied without any reservation.\r\nAll the officers and non-commissioned officers up to the grade of\r\ncaptain are elected by their own men. All the superior officers are\r\nelected by the inferior officers. All under-officers and all inferior\r\nand superior officers are elected for one year only, and are not\r\neligible for re-election until after an interval of a year, during which\r\nthey must serve in the ranks.[2317]--The result is manifest: command, in\r\nevery civil and in every military order, becomes upset; subalterns are\r\nno longer precise and trustworthy instruments; the chief no longer has\r\nany practical hold on them; his orders, consequently, encounter only\r\ntame obedience, doubtful deference, sometimes even open resistance;\r\ntheir execution remains dilatory, uncertain, incomplete, and at\r\nlength is utterly neglected; a latent and soon flagrant system of\r\ndisorganization is instituted by the law. Step by step, in the hierarchy\r\nof Government, power has slipped downwards, and henceforth belongs by\r\nvirtue of the Constitution to the authorities who sit at the bottom of\r\nthe ladder. It is not the King, or the minister, or the directory of the\r\ndepartment or of the district who rules, but its municipal officers;\r\nand their sway is as omnipotent as it can be in a small independent\r\nrepublic. They alone have the \"strong hand\" with which to search the\r\npockets of refractory tax-payers, and ensure the collection of the\r\nrevenue; to seize the rioter by the throat, and protect life and\r\nproperty; in short, to convert the promises and menaces of the law\r\ninto acts. Every armed force, the National Guard, the regulars, and the\r\ngendarmerie, must march on their requisition. They alone, among the body\r\nof administrators, are endowed with this sovereign right; all that the\r\ndepartment or the district can do is to invite them to exercise it. It\r\nis they who proclaim martial law. Accordingly, the sword is in their\r\nhands.[2318] Assisted by commissioners who are appointed by the\r\ncouncil-general of the commune, they prepare the schedule of taxation\r\nof real and personal property, fix the quota of each tax-payer, adjust\r\nassessments, verify the registers and the collector's receipts, audit\r\nhis accounts, discharge the insolvent, answer for returns and authorize\r\nprosecutions.[2319] Private purses are, in this way, at their mercy,\r\nand they take from them whatever they determine to belong to the\r\npublic.--With the purse and the sword in their hands they lack nothing\r\nthat is necessary to make them masters, and all the more because the\r\napplication of every law belongs to them; because no orders of the\r\nAssembly to the King, of the King to the ministers, of ministers to the\r\ndepartments, of departments to the districts, of the districts to\r\nthe communes, brings about any real local result except through them;\r\nbecause each measure of general application undergoes their special\r\ninterpretation, and can always be optionally disfigured, softened,\r\nor exaggerated according to their timidity, inertia, violence or\r\npartiality. Moreover, they are not long in discovering their strength.\r\nWe see them on all sides arguing with their superiors against district,\r\ndepartmental, and ministerial orders, and even against the Assembly\r\nitself; alleging circumstances; lack of means, their own danger and the\r\npublic safety, failing to obey, acting for themselves, openly disobeying\r\nand glorying in the act,[2320] and claiming, as a right, the omnipotence\r\nwhich they exercise in point of fact. Those of Troyes, at the festival\r\nof the Federation, refuse to submit to the precedence of the department\r\nand claim it for themselves, as \"immediate representatives of the\r\npeople.\" Those of Brest, notwithstanding the reiterated prohibitions of\r\ntheir district, dispatch four hundred men and two cannon to force the\r\nsubmission of a neighboring commune to a cure' who has taken the oath.\r\nThose of Arnay-le-Duc arrest Mesdames (the King's aunts), in spite\r\nof their passport signed by the ministers, hold them in spite of\r\ndepartmental and district orders, persist in barring the way to them\r\nin spite of a special decree of the National Assembly, and send two\r\ndeputies to Paris to obtain the sanction of their decision. What with\r\narsenals pillaged, citadels invaded, convoys arrested, couriers\r\nstopped, letters intercepted, constant and increasing insubordination,\r\nusurpations without truce or measure, the municipalities arrogate\r\nto themselves every species of license on their own territory and\r\nfrequently outside of it. Henceforth, forty thousand sovereign bodies\r\nexist in the kingdom. Force is placed in their hands, and they make good\r\nuse of it. They make such good use of it that one of them, the commune\r\nof Paris, taking advantage of its proximity, lays siege to, mutilates,\r\nand rules the National Convention, and through it France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--Municipal Kingdoms.\r\n\r\n     The Municipal bodies.--Their great task.--Their incapacity.\r\n     --Their feeble authority.--Insufficiency of their means of\r\n     action.--The role of the National Guard.--\r\n\r\nLet us follow these municipal kings into their own domain: the burden\r\non their shoulders is immense, and much beyond what human strength can\r\nsupport. All the details of executive duty are confided to them; they\r\nhave not to busy themselves with a petty routine, but with a complete\r\nsocial system which is being taken to pieces, while another is\r\nreconstructed in its place.--They are in possession of four milliards of\r\necclesiastical property, real and personal, and soon there will be two\r\nand a half milliards of property belonging to the emigrants, which must\r\nbe sequestered, valued, managed, inventoried, divided, sold, and the\r\nproceeds received. They have seven or eight thousand monks and thirty\r\nthousand nuns to displace, install, sanction, and provide for. They have\r\nforty-six thousand ecclesiastics, bishops, canons, curés, and vicars,\r\nto dispossess, replace, often by force, and later on to expel, intern,\r\nimprison, and support. They are obliged to discuss, trace out, teach\r\nand make public new territorial boundaries, those of the commune, of the\r\ndistrict and of the department. They have to convoke, lodge, and protect\r\nthe numerous primary and secondary Assemblies, to supervise their\r\noperations, which sometimes last for weeks. They must install those\r\nelected by them, justices of the peace, officers of the National Guard,\r\njudges, public prosecutors, curés, bishops, district and departmental\r\nadministrators. They are to form new lists of tax-payers, apportion\r\namongst themselves, according to a new system of impost, entirely\r\nnew real and personal taxes, decide on claims, appoint an assessor,\r\nregularly audit his accounts and verify his books, aid him with force,\r\nuse force in the collection of the excise and salt duties, which being\r\nreduced, equalized, and transformed in vain by the National Assembly,\r\nafford no returns in spite of its decrees. They are obliged to find the\r\nfunds for dressing, equipping, and arming the National Guard, to step in\r\nbetween it and the military commanders, and to maintain concord between\r\nits diverse battalions. They have to protect forests from pillage,\r\ncommunal land from being invaded, to maintain the octroi, to protect\r\nformer functionaries, ecclesiastics, and nobles, suspected and\r\nthreatened, and, above all, to provide, no matter how, provisions for\r\nthe commune which lacks food, and consequently, to raise subscriptions,\r\nnegotiate purchases at a distance and even abroad, organize escorts,\r\nindemnify bakers, supply the market every week notwithstanding\r\nthe dearth, the insecurity of roads, and the resistance of\r\ncultivators.--Even an absolute chief; sent from a distance and from\r\nhigh place, the most energetic and expert possible, supported by the\r\nbest-disciplined and most obedient troops, would scarcely succeed in\r\nsuch an undertaking; and there is instead only a municipality which has\r\nneither the authority, the means, the experience, the capacity, nor the\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nIn the country, says an orator in the tribune,[2321] \"the municipal\r\nofficers, in twenty thousand out of forty thousand municipalities, do\r\nnot know how to read or write.\" The curé, in effect, is excluded from\r\nsuch offices by law, and, save in La Vendée and the noble is excluded by\r\npublic opinion. Besides, in many of the provinces, nothing but patois\r\nis spoken.[2322] French, especially the philosophic and abstract\r\nphraseology of the new laws and proclamations, remains gibberish\r\nto their inhabitants. They cannot possibly understand and apply the\r\ncomplicated decrees and fine-spun instructions which reach them from\r\nParis. They hurry off to the towns, get the duties of the office imposed\r\non them explained and commented on in detail, try to comprehend, imagine\r\nthey do, and then, the following week, come back again without having\r\nunderstood anything, either the mode of keeping state registers,\r\nthe distinction between feudal rights which are abolished and those\r\nretained, the regulations they should enforce in cases of election,\r\nthe limits which the law imposes as to their powers and subordination.\r\nNothing of all this finds its way into their rude, untrained brains;\r\ninstead of a peasant who has just left his oxen, there is needed here a\r\nlegal adept aided by a trained clerk.--Prudential considerations must\r\nbe added to their ignorance. They do not wish to make enemies for\r\nthemselves in their commune, and they abstain from any positive action,\r\nespecially in all tax matters. Nine months after the decree on the\r\npatriotic contribution, \"twenty-eight thousand municipalities are\r\noverdue, not having (yet) returned either rolls or estimates.\"[2323] At\r\nthe end of January, 1792, \"out of forty thousand nine hundred and eleven\r\nmunicipalities, only five thousand four hundred and forty-eight have\r\ndeposited their registers; two thousand five hundred and eighty rolls\r\nonly are definitive and in process of collection. A large number have\r\nnot even begun their sectional statements.\"[2324]--It is much worse\r\nwhen, thinking that they do understand it, they undertake to do their\r\nwork. In their minds, incapable of abstraction, the law is transformed\r\nand deformed by extraordinary interpretations. We shall see what it\r\nbecomes when it is brought to bear on feudal dues, on the forests, on\r\ncommunal rights, on the circulation of corn, on the taxes on provisions,\r\non the supervision of the aristocrats, and on the protection of persons\r\nand property. According to them, it authorizes and invites them to do\r\nby force, and at once, whatever they need or desire for the time\r\nbeing.--The municipal officers of the large boroughs and towns, more\r\nacute and often able to comprehend the decrees, are scarcely in a\r\nbetter condition to carry them out effectively. They are undoubtedly\r\nintelligent, inspired by the best disposition, and zealous for the\r\npublic welfare. During the first two years of the Revolution it is, on\r\nthe whole, the best informed and most liberal portion of the bourgeoisie\r\nwhich, in the department as in the district, undertakes the management\r\nof affairs. Almost all are men of the law, advocates, notaries, and\r\nattorneys, with a small number of the old privileged class imbued\r\nwith the same spirit, a canon at Besançon, a gentleman at Nîmes. Their\r\nintentions are of the very best; they love order and liberty, they give\r\ntheir time and their money, they hold permanent sessions and accomplish\r\nan incredible amount of work, and they often voluntarily expose\r\nthemselves to great danger.--But they are bourgeois philosophers, and,\r\nin this latter particular, similar to their deputies in the National\r\nAssembly, and, with this twofold character, as incapable as their\r\ndeputies of governing a disintegrated nation. In this twofold character\r\nthey are ill-disposed towards the ancient régime, hostile to Catholicism\r\nand feudal rights, unfavorable to the clergy and the nobility, inclined\r\nto extend the bearing and exaggerate the rigor of recent decrees,\r\npartisans of the Rights of Man, and, therefore, humanitarians and\r\noptimists, disposed to excuse the misdeeds of the people, hesitating,\r\ntardy and often timid in the face of an outbreak--in short, admirable\r\nwriters, exhorters, and reformers, but good for nothing when it comes to\r\nbreaking heads and risking their own bones. They have not been brought\r\nup in such a way as to become men of action in a single day. Up to\r\nthis time they have always lived as passive administrators, as quiet\r\nindividuals, as studious men and clerks, domesticated, conversational,\r\nand polished, to whom words concealed facts, and who, on their evening\r\npromenade, warmly discussed important principles of government, without\r\nany consciousness of the practical machinery which, with a police-system\r\nfor its ultimate wheel, rendered themselves, their promenade, and their\r\nconversation perfectly secure. They are not imbued with that sentiment\r\nof social danger which produces the veritable chief; the man who\r\nsubordinates the emotions of pity to the exigencies of the public\r\nservice. They are not aware that it is better to mow down a hundred\r\nconscientious citizens rather than let them hang a culprit without\r\na trial. Repression, in their hands, is neither prompt, rigid, nor\r\nconstant. They continue to be in the Hôtel-de-Ville what they were\r\nwhen they went into it, so many jurists and scribes, fruitful in\r\nproclamations, reports, and correspondence. Such is wholly their role,\r\nand, if any amongst them, with more energy, desires to depart from it,\r\nhe has no hold on the commune which, according to the Constitution, he\r\nhas to direct, and on that armed force which is entrusted to him with a\r\nview to insure the observance of the laws.\r\n\r\nTo insure respect for authority, indeed, it must not spring up on the\r\nspot and under the hands of its subordinates. It loses its prestige and\r\nindependence when those who create it are precisely those who have to\r\nsubmit to it. For, in submitting to it, they remember that they have\r\ncreated it. This or that candidate among them who has but lately\r\nsolicited their suffrages is now a magistrate who issues orders, and\r\nthis sudden transformation is their work. It is with difficulty that\r\nthey pass from the role of sovereign electors to that of docile subjects\r\nof the administration, and recognize a commander in one of their own\r\ncreatures.[2325] On the contrary, they will submit to his control only\r\nin their own fashion, reserving to themselves in practice the powers the\r\nright to which they have conferred on him.\r\n\r\n\"We gave him his place, and he must do as we want him to do.\"\r\n\r\nSuch popular reasoning is the most natural in the world. It is as\r\napplicable to the municipal officer wearing his scarf as to the officer\r\nin the National Guard wearing his epaulettes; the former as well as\r\nthe latter being conferred by the arbitrary voice of the electors, and\r\nalways seeming to them a gift which is revocable at their pleasure. The\r\nsuperior always, and more particularly in times of danger or of great\r\npublic excitement, seems, if directly appointed by those whom he\r\ncommands, to be their clerk.--Such is municipal authority at this epoch,\r\nintermittent, uncertain, and weak; and all the weaker because the sword,\r\nwhose hilt the men of the Hôtel-de-Ville seem to hold, does not always\r\nleave its scabbard at their bidding. They alone are empowered to summon\r\nthe National Guard, but it does not depend on them, and it is not at\r\ntheir disposal. To obtain its support it is needful that its independent\r\nchiefs should be willing to respond to their requisition; that the men\r\nshould willingly obey their elected officers; that these improvised\r\nsoldiers should consent to quit their plow, their stores, their\r\nworkshops and offices, to lose their day, to patrol the streets at\r\nnight, to be pelted with stones, to fire on a riotous crowd whose\r\nenmities and prejudices they often share. Undoubtedly, they will fire on\r\nsome occasions, but generally they will remain quiet, with their arms\r\nat rest; and, at last, they will grow weary of a trying, dangerous, and\r\nconstant service, which is disagreeable to them, and for which they are\r\nnot fitted. They will not answer the summons, or, if they do, they will\r\ncome too late, and in too small a number. In this event, the regulars\r\nwho are sent for, will do as they do and remain quiet, following their\r\nexample, while the municipal magistrate, into whose hands the sword has\r\nglided, will be able to do no more than make grievous reports, to his\r\nsuperiors of the department or district, concerning the popular violence\r\nof which he is a powerless witness.--In other cases, and especially in\r\nthe country, his condition is worse. The National Guard, preceded by its\r\ndrums, will come and take him off to the town hall to authorize by his\r\npresence, and to legalize by his orders, the outrages that it is about\r\nto commit. He marches along seized by the collar, and affixes his\r\nsignature at the point of the bayonet. In this case not only is his\r\ninstrument taken away from him, but it is turned against of holding it\r\nby the hilt, he feels the point: the armed force which he ought to make\r\nuse of makes use of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--On Universal Suffrage.\r\n\r\n     The National Guard as electors.--Its great power.--Its\r\n     important task.--The work imposed on active citizens.--They\r\n     avoid it.\r\n\r\nBehold, then, the true sovereign, the elector, both National Guard and\r\nvoter. They are the kings designed by the Constitution; there he is,\r\nin every hierarchical stage, with his suffrage, with which to delegate\r\nauthority, and his gun to assure its exercise.--Through his free\r\nchoice he creates all local powers, intermediary, central, legislative,\r\nadministrative, ecclesiastical, and judiciary. He appoints directly, and\r\nin the primary assemblies, the mayor, the municipal board, the public\r\nprosecutor and council of the commune, the justice of the peace and\r\nhis assessors, and the electors of the second degree. Indirectly, and\r\nthrough these elected electors, he appoints the administrators and\r\nprocureurs-syndics of both district and department, the civil and\r\ncriminal judges, the public prosecutor, bishops, and priests, the\r\nmembers of the National Assembly and jurors of the higher National\r\nCourt[2326]. All these commissions which he issues are of short date,\r\nthe principal ones, those of municipal officer, elector, and deputy,\r\nhaving but two years to run; at the end of this brief term their\r\nrecipients are again subject to his vote, in order that, if he is\r\ndispleased with them, he may replace them by others. He must not be\r\nfettered in his choice; in every well-conducted establishment the\r\nlegitimate proprietor must be free easily and frequently to renew his\r\nstaff of clerks. He is the only one in whom confidence can be placed,\r\nand, for greater security, all arms are given up to him. When his\r\nclerks wish to employ force he is the one to place it at their disposal.\r\nWhatever he desired as elector he executes as National Guard. On two\r\noccasions he interferes, both times in a decisive manner; and his\r\ncontrol over the legal powers is irresistible because these are born out\r\nof his vote and are obeyed only through his support.--But these rights\r\nare, at the same time, burdens. The Constitution describes him as an\r\n\"active citizen,\" and this he eminently is or should be, since public\r\naction begins and ends with him, since everything depends on his\r\nzeal and capacity, since the machine is good and only works well\r\nin proportion to his discernment, punctuality, calmness, firmness,\r\ndiscipline at the polls, and in the ranks. The law requires his\r\nservices incessantly day and night, in body and mind, as gendarme and as\r\nelector.--How burdensome this service of gendarme must be, can be judged\r\nby the number of riots. How burdensome that of elector must be, the list\r\nof elections will show.\r\n\r\nIn February, March, April, and May, 1789, there are prolonged parish\r\nmeetings, for the purpose of choosing electors and writing out\r\ngrievances, also bailiwick meetings of still longer duration to choose\r\ndeputies and draw up the memorial. During the months of July and August,\r\n1789, there are spontaneous gatherings to elect or confirm the municipal\r\nbodies; other spontaneous meetings by which the militia is formed and\r\nofficered; and then, following these, constant meetings of this same\r\nmilitia to fuse themselves into a National Guard, to renew officers and\r\nappoint deputies to the federative assemblies. In December, 1789, and\r\nJanuary, 1790, there are primary meetings, to elect municipal officers\r\nand their councils. In May, 1790, there are primary and secondary\r\nmeetings, to appoint district and departmental administrators. In\r\nOctober, 1790, there are primary meetings, to elect the justice of the\r\npeace and his assessors, also secondary meetings, to elect the district\r\ncourts. In November, 1790, there are primary meetings, to renew\r\none-half of the municipal bodies. In February and March, 1791, there\r\nare secondary meetings, to nominate the bishop and curés. In June, July,\r\nAugust, September, 1791, there are primary and secondary meetings,\r\nto renew one-half of the district and departmental administrators, to\r\nnominate the president, the public prosecutor, and the clerk of the\r\ncriminal court, and to choose deputies. In November, 1791, there are\r\nprimary meetings to renew one-half of the municipal council. Observe\r\nthat many of these elections drag along because the voters lack\r\nexperience, because the formalities are complicated, and because\r\nopinions are divided. In August and September, 1791, at Tours, they are\r\nprolonged for thirteen days;[2327] at Troyes, in January, 1790, instead\r\nof three days they last for three weeks; at Paris, in September and\r\nOctober, 1791, only for the purpose of choosing deputies, they last\r\nfor thirty-seven days; in many places their proceedings are contested,\r\nannulled, and begun over again. To these universal gatherings, which\r\nput all France in motion, we must add the local gatherings by which a\r\ncommune approves or gainsays its municipal officers, makes claims on the\r\ndepartment, on the King, or on the Assembly, demands the maintenance\r\nof its parish priest, the provisioning of its market, the arrival\r\nor dispatch of a military detachment,--and think of all that these\r\nmeetings, petitions, and nominations presuppose in the way of\r\npreparatory committees and preliminary meetings and debates! Every\r\npublic representation begins with rehearsals in secret session. In the\r\nchoice of a candidate, and, above all, of a list of candidates; in\r\nthe appointment in each commune of from three to twenty-one municipal\r\nofficers, and from six to forty-two notables; in the selection of twelve\r\ndistrict administrators and thirty-six departmental administrators,\r\nespecially as the list must be of a double length and contain twice\r\nas many officers as there are places to fill, immediate agreement is\r\nimpossible. In every important election the electors are sure to be in\r\na state of agitation a month beforehand, while four weeks of discussion\r\nand caucus is not too much to give to inquiries about candidates, and to\r\ncanvassing voters. Let us add, accordingly, this long preface to each\r\nof the elections, so long and so often repeated, and now sum up the\r\ntroubles and disturbances, all this loss of time, all the labor which\r\nthe process demands. Each convocation of the primary assemblies, summons\r\nto the town-hall or principal town of the canton, for one or for several\r\ndays, about three million five hundred thousand electors of the first\r\ndegree. Each convocation of the assemblies of the second class compels\r\nthe attendance and sojourn at the principal town of the department, and\r\nagain in the principal town of the district, of about three hundred and\r\nfifty thousand elected electors. Each revision or re-election in the\r\nNational Guard gathers together on the public square, or subjects to\r\nroll-call at the town-hall, three or four millions of National\r\nGuards. Each federation, after exacting the same gathering or the same\r\nroll-call, sends delegates by hundreds of thousands to the principal\r\ntowns of the districts and departments, and tens of thousands to\r\nParis.--The powers thus instituted at the cost of so great an effort,\r\nrequire an equal effort to make them work; one branch alone of the\r\nadministration[2328] keeps 2,988 officials busy in the departments,\r\n6,950 in the districts, 1,175,000 in the communes--in all, nearly one\r\nmillion two hundred thousand administrators, whose places, as we have\r\nseen above, are no sinecures. Never did a political machine require so\r\nprodigious an expenditure of force to set it up and keep it in motion.\r\nIn the United States, where it is now (around 1875) deranged by its own\r\naction, it has been estimated that, to meet the intentions of the law\r\nand keep each wheel in its proper place, it would be necessary for each\r\ncitizen to give one whole day in each week, or on-sixth of his time,\r\nto public business. In France, under the newly adopted system, where\r\ndisorder is universal, where the duty of National Guard is added to and\r\ncomplicates that of elector and administrator, I estimate that two days\r\nwould be necessary. This is what the Constitution comes to, this is its\r\nessential and supreme requirement: each active citizen has to give up\r\none-third of his time to public affairs.\r\n\r\nNow, these twelve hundred thousand administrators and three or four\r\nmillion electors and National Guards, are just the men in France who\r\nhave the least leisure. The class of active citizens, indeed, comprises\r\nabout all the men who labor with their hands or with their heads.\r\nThe law exempts only domestics devoted to personal service or common\r\nlaborers who, possessing no property or income, earn less than\r\ntwenty-one sous a day. Every journeyman-miller, the smallest farmer,\r\nevery village proprietor of a cottage or of a vegetable-garden, any\r\nordinary workman, votes at the primary meetings, and may become a\r\nmunicipal officer. Again, if he pays ten francs a year direct tax, if he\r\nis a farmer or yeomen on any property which brings him in four hundred\r\nfrancs, if his rent is one hundred and fifty francs, he may become an\r\nelected elector and an administrator of the district or department.\r\nAccording to this standard the eligible are innumerable; in Doubs, in\r\n1790,[2329] they form two-thirds of the active citizens. Thus, the\r\nway to office is open to all, or almost all, and the law has taken no\r\nprecaution whatever to reserve or provide places for the elite, who\r\ncould best fill them. On the contrary, the nobles, the ecclesiastical\r\ndignitaries, the members of the parliaments, the grand functionaries of\r\nthe ancient regime, the upper class of the bourgeoisie, almost all the\r\nrich who possess leisure, are practically excluded from the elections\r\nby violence, and from the various offices by public opinion: they\r\nsoon retire into private life, and, through discouragement or disgust,\r\nthrough monarchical or religious scruples, abandon entirely a public\r\ncareer.--The burden of the new system falls, accordingly, on the most\r\noccupied portion of the community: on merchants, manufacturers, agents\r\nof the law, employees, shopkeepers, artisans, and cultivators. They\r\nare the people who must give up one-third of their time already\r\nappropriated, neglect private for public business, leave their harvests,\r\ntheir bench, their shop, or their briefs to escort convoys and patrol\r\nthe highways, to run off to the principal town of the canton, district,\r\nor department, and stay and sit there in the town-hall,[2330] subject\r\nto a deluge of phrases and papers, conscious that they are forced to\r\ngratuitous drudgery, and that this drudgery is of little advantage to\r\nthe public.--For the first six months they do it with good grace; their\r\nzeal in penning memorials, in providing themselves with arms against\r\n\"brigands,\" and in suppressing taxes, rents, and tithes, is active\r\nenough. But now that this much is obtained or extorted, decreed as a\r\nright, or accomplished in fact, they must not be further disturbed. They\r\nneed the whole of their time: they have their crops to get in, their\r\ncustomers to serve, their orders to give, their books to make up, their\r\ncredits to adjust, all which are urgent matters, and neither ought to be\r\nneglected or interrupted. Under the lash of necessity and of the crisis\r\nthey have put their backs to it, and, if we take their word for it, they\r\nhauled the public cart out of the mud; but they had no idea of putting\r\nthemselves permanently in harness to drag it along themselves. Confined\r\nas this class has been for centuries to private life, each has his own\r\nwheelbarrow to trundle along, and it is for this, before all and above\r\nall, that he holds himself responsible. From the beginning of the year\r\n1790 the returns of the votes taken show that as many are absent as\r\npresent; at Besançon there are only nine hundred and fifty-nine voters\r\nout of thirty-two hundred inscribed; four months after this more than\r\none-half of the electors fail to come to the polls;[2331] and throughout\r\nFrance, even at Paris, the indifference to voting keeps on increasing.\r\nPuppets of such an administration as that of Louis XV. and Louis XVI. do\r\nnot become Florentine or Athenian citizens in a single night. The hearts\r\nand heads of three or four millions of men are not suddenly endowed with\r\nfaculties and habits which render them capable of diverting one-third of\r\ntheir energies to work which is new, disproportionate, gratuitous, and\r\nsupererogatory.--A fallacy of monstrous duplicity lies at the basis\r\nof the political theories of the day and of those which were\r\ninvented during the following ten years. Arbitrarily, and without any\r\nexamination, a certain weight and resistance are attributed to the human\r\nmetal employed. It is found on trial to have ten times less resistance\r\nand twenty times more weight than was supposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--The Ruling Minority.\r\n\r\n     The restless minority.--Its elements.--The clubs.--Their\r\n     ascendancy.--How they interpret the Rights of Man.--Their\r\n     usurpations and violence.\r\n\r\nIn default of the majority, who shirk their responsibilities, it is the\r\nminority which does the work and assumes the power. The majority having\r\nresigned, the minority becomes sovereign, and public business, abandoned\r\nby the hesitating, weak, and absent multitude, falls into the hands of\r\nthe resolute, energetic, ever-present few who find the leisure and\r\nthe disposition to assume the responsibility. In a system in which all\r\noffices are elective, and in which elections are frequent, politics\r\nbecomes a profession for those who subordinate their private interests\r\nto it, and who find it of personal advantage; every village contains\r\nfive or six men of this class, every borough twenty or thirty, every\r\ntown its hundreds and Paris its many thousands.[2332] These are\r\nveritable active citizens They alone give all their time and attention\r\nto public matters, correspond with the newspapers and with the deputies\r\nat Paris, receive and spread abroad the party watchword on every\r\nimportant question, hold caucuses, get up meetings, make motions, draw\r\nup addresses, overlook, rebuke, or denounce the local magistrates, form\r\nthemselves into committees, publish and push candidates, and go into\r\nthe suburbs and the country to canvass for votes. They hold the power\r\nin recompense for their labor, for they manage the elections, and are\r\nelected to office or provided with places by the successful candidates.\r\nThere is a prodigious number of these offices and places, not only those\r\nof officers of the National Guard and the administrators of the commune,\r\nthe district, and the department, whose duties are gratuitous,\r\nor little short of it, but a quantity of others which are\r\npaid,[2333]--eighty-three bishops, seven hundred and fifty deputies,\r\nfour hundred criminal judges, three thousand and seven civil judges,\r\nfive thousand justices of the peace, twenty thousand assessors forty\r\nthousand communal collectors, forty-six thousand curés, without counting\r\nthe accessory or insignificant places which exist by tens and hundreds\r\nof thousands, from secretaries, clerks, bailiffs and notaries, to\r\ngendarmes, constables, office-clerks, beadles, grave-diggers, and\r\nkeepers of sequestered goods. The pasture is vast for the ambitious; it\r\nis not small for the needy, and they seize upon it. Such is the rule in\r\npure democracies: hence the swarm of politicians in the United States.\r\nWhen the law incessantly calls all citizens to political action, there\r\nare only a few who devote themselves to it; these become expert in this\r\nparticular work, and, consequently, preponderant. But they must be paid\r\nfor their trouble, and the election secures to them their places because\r\nthey manage the elections.\r\n\r\nTwo sorts of men furnish the recruits for this dominant minority: on\r\nthe one hand the enthusiasts, and on the other those who have no social\r\nposition. Towards the end of 1789, moderate people, who are minding\r\ntheir own business, retire into privacy, and are daily less disposed to\r\nshow themselves. The public square is occupied by others who, through\r\nzeal and political passion, abandon their pursuits, and by those who,\r\nfinding themselves hampered in their social sphere, or repelled from\r\nordinary circles, were merely awaiting a new opening to take a fresh\r\nstart. In these utopian and revolutionary times, there is no lack of\r\neither class. Flung out by handfuls, the dogma of popular sovereignty\r\nfalls like a seed scattered around, to end up vegetating in heated\r\nbrains, in the narrow and rash minds which, once possessed by an\r\nidea, adhere to it and are mastered by it. It falls amongst a class of\r\nreasoners who, starting from a principle, dash forward like a horse\r\nwho has had blinders put on. This is especially the case with the legal\r\nclass, whose profession accustoms them to deductions; nor less with the\r\nvillage attorney, the unfrocked monk, the \"intruding\" and excommunicated\r\ncuré, and above all, the journalist and the local orator, who, for\r\nthe first time in his life, finds that he has an audience, applause,\r\ninfluence and a future before him. These are the only people who can do\r\nthe complicated and constant work which the new Constitution calls for;\r\nfor they are the only men whose desires are unlimited, whose dreams are\r\ncoherent, whose doctrine is explicit, whose enthusiasm is contagious,\r\nwho cherish no scruples, and whose presumption is unbounded. Thus has\r\nthe rigid will been wrought and tempered within them, the inward spring\r\nof energy which, being daily more tightly wound up, urges them on to\r\npropaganda and to action.--During the second half of the year 1790 we\r\nsee them everywhere following the example of the Paris Jacobins, styling\r\nthemselves friends of the Constitution, and grouping themselves together\r\nin popular associations. Each town and village gives birth to a club of\r\npatriots who regularly every evening, or several times a week, meet \"for\r\nthe purpose of co-operating for the safety of the commonwealth.\"[2334]\r\nThis is a new and spontaneous organ,[2335] an cancer and a parasite,\r\nwhich develops itself in the social body alongside of its legal\r\norganizations. Its growth insensibly increases, attracting to itself the\r\nsubstance of the others, employing them for its own ends, substituting\r\nitself for them, acting by and for itself alone, a sort of omnivorous\r\noutgrowth the encroachment of which is irresistible, not only because\r\ncircumstances and the working of the Constitution nourish it, but also\r\nbecause its germ, deposited at a great depth, is a living portion of the\r\nConstitution itself.\r\n\r\nFor, placed at the head of the Constitution, as well as of the decrees\r\nwhich are attached to it, stands the Declaration of the Rights of Man.\r\nAccording to this, and by the avowal of the legislators themselves,\r\nthere are two parts to be distinguished in the law, the one superior,\r\neternal, inviolable, which is the self-evident principle, and the other\r\ninferior, temporary, and open to discussion, which comprehends more or\r\nless exact or erroneous applications of this principle. No application\r\nof the law is valid if it derogates from the principle. No institution\r\nor authority is entitled to obedience if it is opposed to the rights\r\nwhich it aims to guarantee. These sacred rights, anterior to all\r\nsociety, take precedence of every social convention, and whenever we\r\nwould know if a legal order is legitimate, we have merely to ascertain\r\nif it is in conformity with natural right. Let us, accordingly, in every\r\ndoubtful or difficult case, refer to this philosophic gospel, to\r\nthis incontestable catechism, this primordial creed proclaimed by the\r\nNational Assembly.--The National Assembly itself invites us to do so.\r\nFor it announces that\r\n\r\n\"ignorance, neglect, or contempt of the rights of man are the sole\r\ncauses of public misfortune, and of the corruption of governments.\"\r\n\r\nIt declares that\r\n\r\n\"the object of every political association is the preservation of\r\nnatural and imprescriptible rights.\"\r\n\r\nIt enumerates them, \"in order that the acts of legislative power and\r\nthe acts of executive power may at once be compared with the purpose\r\nof every political institution.\" It desires \"that every member of the\r\nsocial body should have its declaration constantly in mind.\"--Thus we\r\nare told to control all acts of application by the principle, and\r\nalso we are provided with the rule by which we may and should accord,\r\nmeasure, or even refuse our submission to, deference for, and toleration\r\nof established institutions and legal authority.\r\n\r\nWhat are these superior rights, and, in case of dispute, who will decide\r\nas arbitrator?--There is nothing here like the precise declarations\r\nof the American Constitution,[2336] those positive prescriptions which\r\nserve to sustain a judicial appeal, those express prohibitions which\r\nprevent beforehand certain species of laws from being passed, which\r\nprescribe limits to public powers, which mark out the province not to be\r\ninvaded by the State because it is reserved to the individual.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, in the declaration of the national Assembly, most of\r\nthe articles are abstract dogmas,[2337] metaphysical definitions, more\r\nor less literary axioms, that is to say, more or less false, now vague\r\nand now contradictory, open to various interpretations and to opposite\r\nconstructions, These are good for platform display but bad in practice,\r\nmere stage effect, a sort of pompous standard, useless and heavy, which,\r\nhoisted in front of the Constitutional house and shaken every day\r\nby violent hands, cannot fail soon to tumble on the heads of passers\r\nby.[2338]--Nothing is done to ward off this visible danger. There is\r\nnothing here like that Supreme Court which, in the United States, guards\r\nthe Constitution even against its Congress, and which, in the name of\r\nthe Constitution, actually invalidates a law, even when it has passed\r\nthrough all formalities and been voted on by all the powers;\r\nwhich listens to the complaints of the individual affected by an\r\nunconstitutional law; which stays the sheriff's or collector's hand\r\nraised against him, and which above their heads gives judgment on his\r\ninterests and wrongs. Ill-defined and discordant laws are proclaimed\r\nwithout any provision being made for their interpretation, application\r\nor sanction. No means are taken to have them specially expounded. No\r\ndistrict tribunal is assigned to consider the claims which grow out of\r\nthem, to put an end to litigation legally, peacefully, on a last appeal,\r\nand through a final decision which becomes a precedent and fixes the\r\nloose sense of the text. All this is made the duty of everybody, that is\r\nto say of those who are disposed to charge themselves with it,--in other\r\nwords, the active minority in council assembled.--Thus, in each town\r\nor village it is the local club which, by the authorization of the\r\nlegislator himself, becomes the champion, judge, interpreter and\r\nadministrator of the rights of man, and which, in the name of these\r\nsuperior rights, may protest or rebel, as it seems best, not only\r\nagainst the legitimate acts of legal powers, but also against the\r\nauthentic text of the Constitution and the Laws.[2339]\r\n\r\nConsider, indeed, these rights as they are proclaimed, along with\r\nthe commentary of the speaker who expounds them at the club before an\r\naudience of heated and daring spirits, or in the street to the rude\r\nand fanatical multitude. Every article in the Declaration is a dagger\r\npointed at human society, and the handle has only to be pressed to\r\nmake the blade enter the flesh.[2340] Among \"these natural and\r\nimprescriptible rights\" the legislator has placed \"resistance to\r\noppression.\" We are oppressed: let us resist and take up arms. According\r\nto this legislator, \"society has the right to bring every public agent\r\nof the Administration to account.\" Let us away to the Hôtel-de-Ville,\r\nand interrogate our lukewarm or suspected magistrates, and watch their\r\nsessions to see if they prosecute priests and disarm the aristocrats;\r\nlet us stop their intrigues against the people; let us force these\r\nslow clerks to hasten their steps.--According to this legislator\r\n\"all citizens have the right to take part in person, or through their\r\nrepresentatives, in the formation of the law.\" There must thus be no\r\nmore electors privileged by their payment of a three-franc tax. Down\r\nwith the new aristocracy of active citizens! Let us restore to the\r\ntwo millions of proletarians the right of suffrage, of which the\r\nConstitution has unjustly defrauded them!--According to this legislator,\r\n\"men are born and remain free, and equal in their rights.\" Consequently,\r\nlet no one be excluded from the National Guard; let everybody, even\r\nthe pauper, have some kind of weapon, a pike or gun, to defend his\r\nfreedom!--In the very terms of the Declaration, \"the law is the\r\nexpression of the universal will.\" Listen to these clamors in the open\r\nstreets, to these petitions flowing in from the towns on all sides;\r\nbehold the universal will, the living law which abolishes the written\r\nlaw! On the strength of this the leader of a few clubs in Paris are to\r\ndepose the King, to violate the Legislative Assembly and decimate the\r\nNational Convention.--In other terms, the turbulent, factious minority\r\nis to supplant the sovereign nation, and henceforth there is nothing to\r\nhinder it from doing what it pleases just when it pleases. The operation\r\nof the Constitution has given to it the reality of power, while the\r\npreamble of the Constitution clothes it with the semblance of right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--Summary of the work of the Constituent Assembly.\r\n\r\nSuch is the work of the Constituent Assembly. In several of its laws,\r\nespecially those which relate to private interests, in the institution\r\nof civil regulations, in the penal and rural codes,[2341] in the\r\nfirst attempts at, and the promise of, a uniform civil code, in the\r\nenunciation of a few simple regulations regarding taxation, procedure,\r\nand administration, it planted good seed. But in all that relates to\r\npolitical institutions and social organization its proceedings are those\r\nof an academy of Utopians, and not those of practical legislators.--On\r\nthe sick body entrusted to it, it performed amputations which were as\r\nuseless as they were excessive, and applied bandages as inadequate as\r\nthey were injurious. With the exception of two or three restrictions\r\nadmitted inadvertently, and the maintenance of the show of royalty, also\r\nthe obligation of a small electoral qualification, it carried out its\r\nprinciple to the end, the principle of Rousseau. It deliberately refused\r\nto consider man as he really was under its own eyes, and persisted\r\nin seeing nothing in him but the abstract being created in books.\r\nConsequently, with the blindness and obstinacy characteristic of a\r\nspeculative surgeon, it destroyed, in the society submitted to its\r\nscalpel and its theories, not only the tumors, the enlargements, and the\r\ninflamed parts of the organs, but also the organs themselves, and even\r\nthe vital governing centers around which cells arrange themselves to\r\nrecompose an injured organ. That is, the Assembly destroyed on the one\r\nhand the time-honored, spontaneous, and lasting societies formed by\r\ngeographical position, history, common occupations and interests, and\r\non the other, those natural chiefs whose name, repute, education,\r\nindependence, and earnestness designated them as the best qualified to\r\noccupy high positions. In one direction it despoils and permits the\r\nruin and proscription of the superior class, the nobles, the members of\r\nParliament, and the upper middle class. In another it dispossesses and\r\nbreaks up all historic or natural corporations, religious congregations,\r\nclerical bodies, provinces, parliaments, societies of art and of all\r\nother professions and pursuits. This done, every tie or bond which\r\nholds men together is found to be severed; all subordination and every\r\ngraduated scale of rank have disappeared. There is no longer rank and\r\nfile, or commander-in-chief. Nothing remains but individual particles,\r\n26 millions of equal and disconnected atoms. Never was so much\r\ndisintegrated matter, less capable of resistance, offered to hands\r\nundertaking to mold it. Harshness and violence will be sufficient to\r\nensure success. These brutal hands are ready for the work, and the\r\nAssembly which has reduced the material to powder has likewise\r\nprovided the mortar and pestle. As awkward in destruction as it is in\r\nconstruction, it invents for the restoration of order in a society which\r\nis turned upside down a machine which would, of itself, create\r\ndisorder in a tranquil society. The most absolute and most concentrated\r\ngovernment would not be strong enough to effect without disturbance a\r\nsimilar equalization of ranks, the same dismemberment of associations,\r\nand the same displacement of property. No social transformation can\r\nbe peacefully accomplished without a well-commanded army, obedient and\r\neverywhere present, as was the case in the emancipation of the Russian\r\nserfs by Emperor Alexander. The new Constitution,[2342] on the contrary,\r\nreduces the King to the position of an honorary president, suspected\r\nand called in question by a disorganized State. Between him and the\r\nlegislative body it interposes nothing but sources of conflict, and\r\nsuppresses all means of concord. The monarch has no hold whatever on the\r\nadministrative departments which he must direct; the mutual independence\r\nof the powers, from the center to the extremities of the State,\r\neverywhere produces indifference, negligence, and disobedience between\r\nthe injunctions issued and their execution. France is a federation of\r\nforty thousand municipal sovereignties, in which the authority of legal\r\nmagistrates varies according to the caprice of active citizens. These\r\nactive citizens, too heavily loaded, shy away from the performance\r\nof public duty; in which a minority of fanatics and ambitious men\r\nmonopolize the right to speak, to vote, all influence, the power and\r\nall action. They justify their multiple ursurpations, their unbridled\r\ndespotism, and their increasing encroachments by the Declaration of\r\nthe Rights of Man. The masterpiece[2343] of ideal abstractions and\r\nof practical absurdities is accomplished. In accordance with the\r\nConstitution spontaneous anarchy becomes legalized anarchy. The latter\r\nis perfect; nothing finer of the kind has been seen since the ninth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2301: The name for the dreaded secret Royal warrant of arrest.\r\n(SR.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2302: The initiative rests with the King on one point: war\r\ncannot be decreed by the Assembly except on his formal and preliminary\r\nproposition.

[3101]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--The Federations.\r\n\r\n     Popular application of philosophic theory.--Idyllic\r\n     celebration of the Contrat-Social.--The two strata of the\r\n     human mind.--Permanent disorder.\r\n\r\nIf there ever was an Utopia which seemed capable of realization, or,\r\nwhat is still more to the purpose, was really applied, converted into a\r\nfact, fully established, it is that of Rousseau, in 1789 and during the\r\nthree following years. For, not only are his principles embodied in the\r\nlaws, and the Constitution throughout animated with his spirit, but it\r\nseems as if the nation looked upon his ideological gambols, his abstract\r\nfiction, as serious. This fiction it carried out in every particular. A\r\nsocial contract, at one spontaneous and practical, an immense\r\ngathering of men associating together freely for the first time for the\r\nrecognition of their respective rights, forming a specific compact,\r\nand binding themselves by a solemn oath: such is the social recipe\r\nprescribed by the philosophers, and which is carried out to the letter.\r\nMoreover, as this recipe is esteemed infallible, the imagination is\r\nworked upon and the sensibilities of the day are brought into play.\r\nIt is admitted that men, on again becoming equals, have again become\r\nbrothers.[3102] A sudden and amazing harmony of all volitions and\r\nall intelligences will restore the golden age on earth. It is proper,\r\naccordingly, to regard the social contract as a festival, an affecting,\r\nsublime idyll, in which, from one end of France to the other, all, hand\r\nin hand, should assemble and swear to the new compact, with song, with\r\ndance, with tears of joy, with shouts of gladness, the worthy beginning\r\nof public felicity. With unanimous assent, indeed, the idyll is\r\nperformed as if according to a written program.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of November, 1789, at Etoile, near Valence, the federations\r\nbegan.[3103] Twelve thousand National Guards, from the two banks of the\r\nRhône, promise \"to remain for ever united, to insure the circulation of\r\ngrain, and to maintain the laws passed by the National Assembly.\" On the\r\n13th of December, at Montélimart, six thousand men, the representatives\r\nof 27 000 other men, take a similar oath and confederate themselves with\r\nthe foregoing.--Upon this the excitement spreads from month to month\r\nand from province to province. Fourteen towns of the bailiwicks of\r\nFranche-Comté form a patriotic league. At Pontivy, Brittany enters into\r\nfederal relations with Anjou. One thousand National Guards of Vivarais\r\nand Languedoc send their delegates to Voute. 48 000 in the Vosges send\r\ntheir deputies to Epinal. During February, March, April, and May, 1790,\r\nin Alsace, Champagne, Dauphiny, Orléanais, Touraine, Lyonnais, and\r\nProvence, there is the same spectacle. At Draguignan eight thousand\r\nNational Guards take the oath in the presence of 20 000 spectators. At\r\nLyons 50 000 men, delegates of more than 500 000 others take the civic\r\noath.--But local unions are not sufficient to complete the organization\r\nof France; a general union of all Frenchmen must take place. Many of the\r\nvarious National Guards have already written to Paris for the purpose of\r\naffiliating themselves with the National Guard there; and, one the 5th\r\nof June, the Parisian municipal body having proposed it, the Assembly\r\ndecrees the universal federation. It is to take place on the 14th\r\nof July, everywhere on the same day, both at the center and at the\r\nextremities of the kingdom. There is to be one in the principal town\r\nof each district and of each department, and one in the capital. To\r\nthe latter each body of the National Guards is to send deputies in\r\nthe proportion of one man to every two hundred; and each regiment one\r\nofficer, one non-commissioned officer, and four privates. Fourteen\r\nthousand representatives of the National Guard of the provinces appear\r\non the Champ de Mars, the theater of the festival; also eleven to twelve\r\nthousand representatives of the land and marine forces, besides\r\nthe National Guard of Paris, and sixty thousand spectators on the\r\nsurrounding slopes, with a still greater crowd on the heights of\r\nChaillot and of Passy. All rise to their feet and swear fidelity to the\r\nnation, to the law, to the King and to the new Constitution. When the\r\nreport of the cannon is heard which announces the taking of the oath,\r\nthose of the Parisians who have remained at home, men, women, and\r\nchildren, raise their hands in the direction of the Champ de Mars\r\nand likewise make their affirmation. In every principal town of every\r\ndistrict, department, and commune in France there is the same oath on\r\nthe same day. Never was there a more perfect social compact heard of.\r\nHere, for the first time in the world, everybody beholds a veritable\r\nlegitimate society, for it is founded on free pledges, on solemn\r\nstipulations, and on actual consent. They possess the authentic act and\r\nthe dated official report of it.[3104]\r\n\r\nThere is still something more--the time and the occasion betoken a union\r\nof all hearts. The barriers which have hitherto separated men from each\r\nother are all removed and without effort. Provincial antagonisms are\r\nnow to cease: the confederates of Brittany and Anjou write that they\r\nno longer desire to be Angevins and Bretons, but simply Frenchmen. All\r\nreligious discords are to come to an end: at Saint-Jean-du-Gard, near\r\nAlais, the Catholic curé and the Protestant pastor embrace each other at\r\nthe altar; the pastor occupies the best seat in the church, and at the\r\nProtestant meeting-house the curé has the place of honor, and listens to\r\nthe sermon of the pastor.[3105] Distinctions of rank and condition will\r\nno longer exist; at Saint-Andéol \"the honor of taking the oath in the\r\nname of the people is conferred on two old men, one ninety-three and\r\nthe other ninety-four years of age, one a noble and a colonel of the\r\nNational Guard, and the other a simple peasant.\" At Paris, two hundred\r\nthousand persons of all conditions, ages, and sexes, officers and\r\nsoldiers, monks and actors, school-boys and masters, dandies and\r\nragamuffins, elegant ladies and fishwives, workmen of every class and\r\nthe peasants from the vicinity, all flocked to the Champ de Mars to dig\r\nthe earth which was not ready, and in a week, trundling wheelbarrows and\r\nhandling the pick-ax as equals and comrades, all voluntarily yoked in\r\nthe same service, converted a flat surface into a valley between two\r\nhills.--At Strasbourg, General Luckner, commander-in-chief, worked a\r\nwhole afternoon in his shirt-sleeves just like the commonest laborer.\r\nThe confederates are fed, housed, and have their expenses paid\r\neverywhere on all the roads. At Paris the publicans and keepers of\r\nfurnished houses lower their prices of their own accord, and do not\r\nthink of robbing their new guests. \"The districts,\" moreover, \"feast the\r\nprovincials to their heart's content.[3106] There are meals every day\r\nfor from twelve to fifteen hundred people.\" Provincials and Parisians,\r\nsoldiers and bourgeois, seated and mingled together, drink each other's\r\nhealth and embrace. The soldiers, especially, and the inferior officers\r\nare surrounded, welcomed, and entertained to such an extent that they\r\nlose their heads, their health, and more besides. One \"old trooper, who\r\nhad been over fifty years in the service, died on the way home, used up\r\nwith cordials and excess of pleasure.\" In short, the joy is excessive,\r\nas it should be on the great day when the wish of an entire century\r\nis accomplished.--Behold ideal felicity, as displayed in the books\r\nand illustrations of the time! The natural man buried underneath an\r\nartificial civilization is disinterred, and again appears as in early\r\ndays, as in Tahiti, as in philosophic and literary pastorals, as in\r\nbucolic and mythological operas, confiding, affectionate, and happy.\r\n\"The sight of all these beings again restored to the sweet sentiments of\r\nprimitive brotherhood is an exquisite delight almost too great for the\r\nsoul to support,\" and the Frenchman, more light-hearted and far more\r\nchildlike than he is to-day, gives himself up unrestrainedly to his\r\nsocial, sympathetic, and generous instincts. Whatever the imagination\r\nof the day offers him to increase his emotions, all the classical,\r\nrhetorical, and dramatic material at his command, are employed for\r\nthe embellishment of his festival. Already wildly enthusiastic, he\r\nis anxious to increase his enthusiasm.--At Lyons, the fifty thousand\r\nconfederates from the south range themselves in line of battle around an\r\nartificial rock, fifty feet high, covered with shrubs, and surmounted by\r\na Temple of Concord in which stands a huge statue of Liberty; the\r\nsteps of the rock are decked with flags, and a solemn mass precedes the\r\nadministration of the oath.--At Paris, an alter dedicated to the nation\r\nis erected in the middle of the Champ de Mars, which is transformed\r\ninto a colossal circus. The regular troops and the federations of the\r\ndepartments stand in position around it, the King being in front\r\nwith the Queen and the dauphin, while near them are the princes and\r\nprincesses in a gallery, and the members of the National Assembly in\r\nan amphitheater; two hundred priests, draped in their albs and with\r\ntricolored belts, officiate around Talleyrand, Bishop of Autun; three\r\nhundred drums and twelve hundred musicians all play at once; forty piece\r\nof cannon are discharged at one volley, and four hundred thousand cheers\r\ngo up as if from one threat. Never was such an effort made to intoxicate\r\nthe senses and strain the nerves beyond their powers of endurance!--The\r\nmoral machine is made to vibrate to the same and even to a greater\r\nextent. For more than a year past, harangues, proclamations, addresses,\r\nnewspapers and events have daily added one degree more to the pressure.\r\nOn this occasion, thousands of speeches, multiplied by myriads of\r\nnewspapers, carry the enthusiasm to the highest pitch. Declamation foams\r\nand rolls along in a steady stream of rhetoric everywhere throughout\r\nFrance.[3107] In this state of excitement the difference between\r\nmagniloquence and sincerity, between the false and the true, between\r\nshow and substance, is no longer distinguishable. The Federation becomes\r\nan opera which is seriously played in the open street--children have\r\nparts assigned them in it; it occurs to no one that they are puppets,\r\nand that the words taken for an expression of the heart are simply\r\nmemorized speeches that have been put into their mouths. At Besançon,\r\non the return of the confederates, hundreds of \"youthful citizens\" from\r\ntwelve to fourteen years of age,[3108] in the national uniform, \"with\r\nsword in hand,\" march up to the standard of Liberty. Three little girls\r\nfrom eleven to thirteen years old and two little boy of nine years\r\neach pronounce \"a discourse full of fire and breathing nothing but\r\npatriotism;\" after which, a young lady of fourteen, raising her voice\r\nand pointing to the flag, harangues in turn the crowd, the deputies, the\r\nNational Guard, the mayor, and the commander of the troops, the scene\r\nending with a ball. This is the universal finale--men and women,\r\nchildren and adults, common people and men of the world, chiefs and\r\nsubordinates, all, everywhere, frisk about as in the last act of a\r\npastoral drama. At Paris,--writes an eye-witness, \"I saw chevaliers of\r\nSaint-Louis and chaplains dancing in the street with people belonging\r\nto their department.\"[3109] At the Champ de Mars, on the day of the\r\nFederation, notwithstanding that rain was falling in torrents, \"the\r\nfirst arrivals began to dance, and those who came after them, joining\r\nin, formed a circle which soon spread over a portion of the Champ\r\nde Mars. . . .Three hundred thousand spectators kept time with their\r\nhands.\" On the following days dancing is kept up on the Champ de Mars\r\nand in the streets, and there is drinking and carousing; \"there was\r\na ball with refreshments at the Corn-Exchange, and on the site of the\r\nBastille.\"--At Tours, where fifty-two detachments from the neighboring\r\nprovinces are collected, about four o'clock in the afternoon,[3110]\r\nthrough an irresistible outburst of insane gaiety, \"the officers,\r\ninferior officers, and soldiers, pell-mell, race through the streets,\r\nsome with saber in hand and others dancing and shouting 'Vive le Roi!'\r\n'Vive la Nation!' flinging up their hats and compelling every one\r\nthey met to join in the dance. One of the canons of the cathedral, who\r\nhappens to be passing quietly along, has a grenadier's cap put on his\r\nhead,\" and is dragged into the circle, and after him two monks; \"they\r\nare often embraced,\" and then allowed to depart. The carriages of the\r\nmayor and the Marquise de Montausier arrive; people mount up behind,\r\nget inside, and seat themselves in front, as many as can find room,\r\nand force the coachmen to parade through the principal streets in this\r\nfashion. There is no malice in it, nothing but sport and the overflow of\r\nspirits. \"Nobody was maltreated or insulted, although almost every one\r\nwas drunk.\"--Nevertheless, there is one bad symptom: the soldiers of\r\nthe Anjou regiment leave their barracks the following day and \"pass\r\nthe whole night abroad, no one being able to hinder them.\" And there is\r\nanother of still graver aspect; at Orleans, after the companies of\r\nthe National Militia had danced on the square in the evening, \"a large\r\nnumber of volunteers marched in procession through the town with\r\ndrums, shouting out with all their might that the aristocracy must be\r\ndestroyed, and that priests and aristocrats should be strung up to the\r\nlamp post. They enter a suspected coffee-house, drive out the inmates\r\nwith insults, lay hands on a gentleman who is supposed not to have cried\r\nout as correctly and as lustily as themselves, and come near to hanging\r\nhim.[3111]--Such is the fruit of the philosophy and the attitudes of the\r\neighteenth century. Men believed that, for the organization of a\r\nperfect society and the permanent establishment of freedom, justice, and\r\nhappiness on earth, an inspiration of sentiments and an act of the will\r\nwould suffice. The inspiration came and the act was fulfilled; they have\r\nbeen carried away, delighted, affected and out of their minds. Now comes\r\nthe reaction, when they have to fall back upon themselves. The effort\r\nhas succeeded in accomplishing all that it could accomplish, namely, a\r\ndeluge of emotional demonstrations and slogans, a verbal and not a real\r\ncontract ostentatious fraternity skin-deep, a well-meaning masquerade,\r\nan outpouring of feeling evaporating through its own pageantry--in\r\nshort, an agreeable carnival of a day's duration.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that in the human mind there are two strata. One\r\nsuperficial, of which men are conscious, the other deep down, of which\r\nthey are unconscious.[3112] The former unstable and vacillating like\r\nshifting sand, the latter stable and fixed like a solid rock, to which\r\ntheir caprices and agitation never descend. The latter alone determines\r\nthe general inclination of the soil, the main current of human activity\r\nnecessarily following the bent thus prepared for it.--Certainly embraces\r\nhave been interchanged and oaths have been taken; but after, as before\r\nthe ceremony, men are just what many centuries of administrative\r\nthralldom and one century of political literature have made them. Their\r\nignorance and presumption, their prejudices, hatreds, and distrusts,\r\ntheir inveterate intellectual and emotional habits are still preserved.\r\nThey are human, and their stomachs need to be filled daily. They have\r\nimagination, and, if bread be scarce, they fear that they may not get\r\nenough of it. They prefer to keep their money rather than to give\r\nit away. For this reason they spurn the claims which the State and\r\nindividuals have upon them as much as possible. They avoid paying their\r\ndebts. They willingly lay their hands on public property which is badly\r\nprotected; finally they are disposed to regard gendarmes and proprietors\r\nas detrimental, and all the more so because this has been repeated to\r\nthem over and over again, day after day, for a whole year.--On the other\r\nhand there is no change in the situation of things. They are ever living\r\nin a disorganized community, under an impracticable constitution, the\r\npassions which sap public order being only the more stimulated by the\r\nsemblance of fraternity under which they seemed to be allayed. Men\r\ncannot be persuaded with impunity that the millennium has come, for\r\nthey will want to enjoy it immediately, and will tolerate no deception\r\npracticed on their expectations. In this violent state, fired by\r\nboundless expectations, all their whims appear reasonable and all\r\ntheir opinions rational. They are no longer able to find faults with\r\nor control themselves. In their brain, overflowing with emotions and\r\nenthusiasm, there is no room but for one intense, absorbing, fixed idea.\r\nEach is confident and over-confident in his own opinion; all become\r\nimpassioned, imperious, and intractable. Having assumed that all\r\nobstacles are taken out of the way, they grow indignant at each obstacle\r\nthey actually encounter. Whatever it may be, they shatter it on the\r\ninstant, and their over-excited imagination covers with the fine name of\r\npatriotism their natural appetite for despotism and domination.\r\n\r\nFrance, accordingly, in the three years which follow the taking of the\r\nBastille, presents a strange spectacle. In the words we find charity\r\nand in the laws symmetry; while the actual events present a spectacle of\r\ndisorder and violence. Afar, is the reign of philosophy; close up is the\r\nchaos of the Carlovingian era.\r\n\r\n\"Foreigners,\" remarks an observer,[3113] \"are not aware that, with a\r\ngreat extension of political rights, the liberty of the individual is in\r\nlaw reduced to nothing, while in practice it is subject to the caprice\r\nof sixty thousand constitutional assemblies; that no citizen enjoys any\r\nprotection against the annoyances of these popular assemblies; that,\r\naccording to the opinions which they entertain of persons and things,\r\nthey act in one place in one way and in another place in another way.\r\nHere, a department, acting for itself and without referring elsewhere,\r\nputs an embargo on vessels, while another orders the expulsion of a\r\nmilitary detachment essential for the security of places devastated\r\nby ruffians; and the minister, who responds to the demands of those\r\ninterested, replies: 'Such are the orders of the department.' Elsewhere\r\nare administrative bodies which, the moment the Assembly decrees relief\r\nof consciences and the freedom of nonjuring priests, order the latter\r\nout of their homes within 24 hours. Always in advance of or lagging\r\nbehind the laws; alternately bold and cowardly; daring all things when\r\nseconded by public license, and daring nothing to repress it; eager to\r\nabuse their momentary authority against the weak in order to acquire\r\ntitles to popularity in the future; incapable of maintaining order\r\nexcept at the expense of public safety and tranquility; entangled in\r\nthe reins of their new and complex administration, adding the fury of\r\npassion to incapacity and inexperience; such are, for the most part,\r\nthe men sprung from nothing, void of ideas and drunk with pretension,\r\non whom now rests responsibility for public powers and resources, the\r\ninterest of security, and the foundations of the power of government.\r\nIn all sections of the nation, in every branch of the administration, in\r\nevery report, we detect the confusion of authorities, the uncertainty\r\nof obedience, the dissolution of all restraints, the absence of all\r\nresources, the deplorable complication of enervated springs, without any\r\nof the means of real power, and, for their sole support, laws which,\r\nin supposing France to be peopled with men without vices or passions,\r\nabandon humanity to its primitive state of independence.\"\r\n\r\nA few months after this, in the beginning of 1792, Malouet sums up all\r\nin one phrase:\r\n\r\n\"It is the Government of Algiers without the Dey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--Independence of the municipalities.\r\n\r\n     The causes of their initiative.--Sentiment of danger.\r\n     --Issy-l'Evêque in 1789.--Exalted pride.--Brittany in 1790.\r\n     --Usurpations of the municipalities.--Capture of the\r\n     citadels.--Violence increased against their commanders.\r\n     --Stoppage of convoys.--Powerlessness of the Directories and\r\n     the ministers.--Marseilles in 1790.\r\n\r\nThings could not work otherwise. For, before the 6th of October, and the\r\nKing's captivity in Paris, the Government had already been destroyed.\r\nNow, through the successive decrees of the Assembly, it is legally done\r\naway with, and each local group is left to itself.--The intendants have\r\nfled, military commanders are not obeyed, the bailiwicks dare hold no\r\ncourts, the parliaments are suspended, and seven months elapse before\r\nthe district and department administrations are elected, a year before\r\nthe new judgeships are instituted, while afterwards, as well as before,\r\nthe real power is in the hands of the communes.--The commune must arm\r\nitself, appoint its own chiefs, provide its own supplies, protect itself\r\nagainst brigands, and feed its own poor. It has to sell its national\r\nproperty, install the constitutional priest, and, amidst so many eager\r\npassions and injured interest, accomplish the transformation by which\r\na new society replaces the ancient one. It alone has to ward off the\r\nperpetual and constantly reviving dangers which assail it or which it\r\nimagines. These are great, and it exaggerates them. It is inexperienced\r\nand alarmed. It is not surprising that, in the exercise of its\r\nextemporized power, it should pass beyond its natural or legal limit,\r\nand without being aware of it, overstep the metaphysical line which the\r\nConstitution defines between its rights and the rights of the State.\r\nNeither hunger, fear, rage, nor any of the popular passions can wait;\r\nthere is no time to refer to Paris. Action is necessary, immediate\r\naction, and, with the means at hand, they must save themselves as well\r\nas they can. This or that mayor of a village is soon to find himself a\r\ngeneral and a legislator. This or that petty town is to give itself\r\na charter like Laon or Vezelay in the twelfth century. \"On the 6th\r\nof October, 1789,[3114] near Autun, the market-town of Issy-l'Evêque\r\ndeclares itself an independent State. The parish assembly is convoked\r\nby the priest, M. Carion, who is appointed member of the administrative\r\ncommittee and of the new military staff. In full session he secures the\r\nadoption of a complete code, political, judiciary, penal and military,\r\nconsisting of sixty articles. Nothing is overlooked; we find ordinances\r\nconcerning\r\n\r\n\"the town police, the laying out of streets and public squares,\r\nthe repairs of prisons, the road taxes and price of grain, the\r\nadministration of justice, fines, confiscations, and the diet of the\r\nNational Guards.\"\r\n\r\nHe is a provincial Solon,[3115] zealous for the public welfare, and a\r\nman of executive power, he expounds his ordinances from the pulpit, and\r\nthreatens the refractory. He passes decrees and renders judgments in the\r\ntown-hall: outside the town limits, at the head of the National Guard,\r\nsaber in hand, he will enforce his own decisions. He causes it to be\r\ndecided that, on the written order of the committee, every citizen may\r\nbe imprisoned. He imposes and collects taxes; he has boundary walls\r\ntorn down; he goes in person to the houses of cultivators and makes\r\nrequisitions for grain; he seizes the convoys which have not deposited\r\ntheir quote in his own richly stored granaries. One day, preceded by\r\na drummer, he marches outside the walls, makes proclamation of \"his\r\nagrarian laws,\" and proceeds at once to the partition of the territory,\r\nand, by virtue of the ancient communal or church property rights,\r\nto assign to himself a portion of it. All this is done in public and\r\nconsciously, the notary and the scrivener being called in to draw up the\r\nofficial record of his acts; he is satisfied that human society has come\r\nto an end, and that each local group has the right to begin over again\r\nand apply in its own way the Constitution which it has accorded to\r\nitself without reference to anybody else.--This man, undoubtedly, talks\r\ntoo loudly, an proceeds too quickly; and first the bailiwick, next the\r\nChâtelet, and afterwards the National Assembly temporarily put a stop\r\nto his proceedings; but his principle is a popular one, and the forty\r\nthousand communes of France are about to act like so many distinct\r\nrepublics, under the sentimental and constantly more powerless\r\nreprimands of the central authority.\r\n\r\nExcited and invigorated by a new sentiment, men now abandon themselves\r\nto the proud consciousness of their own power and independence. Nowhere\r\nis greater satisfaction found than among the new local chiefs, the\r\nmunicipal officers and commanders of the National Guard, for never\r\nbefore has such supreme authority and such great dignity fallen upon\r\nmen previously so submissive and so insignificant.--Formerly the\r\nsubordinates of an intendant or sub-delegate, appointed, maintained, and\r\nill-used by him, kept aloof from transactions of any importance,\r\nunable to defend themselves except by humble protestations against the\r\naggravation of taxation, concerned with precedence and the conflicts\r\nof etiquette,[3116] plain townspeople or peasants who never dreamt of\r\ninterfering in military matters, henceforth become sovereigns in all\r\nmilitary and civil affairs. This or that mayor or syndic of a little\r\ntown or parish, a petty bourgeois or villager in a blouse, whom the\r\nintendant or military commander could imprison at will, now orders\r\na gentleman, a captain of dragoons, to march or stand still, and the\r\ncaptain stands still or marches at his command. On the same bourgeois\r\nor villager depends the safety of the neighboring chateau, of the large\r\nland-owner and his family, of the prelate, and of all the prominent\r\npersonages of the district in order that they may be out of harm's way\r\nhe must protect them; they will be pillaged if, in case of insurrection,\r\nhe does not send troops and the National Guard to their assistance. It\r\nis he who, lending or refusing public force to the collection of\r\ntheir rents, gives them or deprives them of the means of living. He\r\naccordingly rules, and on the sole condition of ruling according to the\r\nwishes of his equals, the vociferous multitude, the restless, dominant\r\nmob which has elected him.--In the towns, especially, and notably in the\r\nlarge towns, the contrast between what he was and what he is immense,\r\nsince to the plenitude of his power is added the extent of his\r\njurisdiction. Judge of the effect on his brain in cities like those of\r\nMarseilles, Bordeaux, Nantes, Rouen and Lyons, where he holds in his\r\nhand the lives and property of eighty or a hundred thousand men. And\r\nthe more as, amid the municipal officers of the towns, three-quarters\r\nof them, prosecutors or lawyers, are imbued with the new dogmas, and are\r\npersuaded that in themselves alone, the directly elected of the\r\npeople, is vested all legitimate authority. Bewildered by their recent\r\nelevation, distrustful as upstarts, in revolt against all ancient or\r\nrival powers, they are additionally alarmed by their imagination and\r\nignorance, their minds being vaguely disturbed by the contrast between\r\ntheir role in the past and their present role: anxious on their own\r\naccount, they find no security but in abuse and use of power. The\r\nmunicipalities, on the strength of the reports emanating from the\r\ncoffee-houses, decide that the ministry are traitors. With an obstinacy\r\nof conviction and a boldness of presumption alike extraordinary, they\r\nbelieve that they have the right to act without and against their\r\norders, and against the orders of the National Assembly itself, as\r\nif, in the now disintegrated France, each municipality constituted the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThus, if the armed force of the country is now obedient to any body, it\r\nis to them and to them alone, and not only the National Guard, but also\r\nthe regular troops which, placed under the orders of municipalities by\r\na decree of the National Assembly,[3117] will comply with no other.\r\nMilitary commanders in the provinces, after September, 1787, declare\r\nthemselves powerless; when they and the municipality give orders, it\r\nis only those of the municipality which the troops recognize. \"However\r\npressing may be the necessity for moving the troops where their\r\npresence is required, they are stopped by the resistance of the village\r\ncommittee.\"[3118] \"Without any reasonable motive,\" writes the commander\r\nof the forces in Brittany, \"Vannes and Auray made opposition to the\r\ndetachment which I thought it prudent to send to Belle-Ile, to replace\r\nanother one. . . The Government cannot move without encountering\r\nobstacles. . . . The Minister of War no longer has the direction of the\r\narmy. . . . No orders are executed. . . Every one wants to command, and\r\nno one to obey. . . How could the King, the Government, or the Minister\r\nof War send troops where they are wanted if the towns believe that they\r\nhave the right to countermand the orders given to the regiments and\r\nchange their destination?\"-And it is still worse, for, \"on the false\r\nsupposition of brigands and conspiracies which do not exist,[3119] the\r\ntowns and villages make demands on me for arms and even cannon. . . The\r\nwhole of Brittany will soon be in a frightful belligerent state on this\r\naccount, for, having no real enemies, they will turn their arms against\r\neach other.\"--This is of no consequence. The panic is an \"epidemic.\"\r\nPeople are determined to believe in \"brigands and enemies.\" At Nantes,\r\nthe assertion is constantly repeated that the Spaniards are going to\r\nland, that the French regiments are going to make an attack, that an\r\narmy of brigands is approaching, that the castle is threatened, that\r\nit is threatening, and that it contains too many engines of war. The\r\ncommandant of the province writes in vain to the mayor to reassure\r\nhim, and to explain to him that \"the municipality, being master of\r\nthe chateau, is likewise master of its magazine. Why then should it\r\nentertain fear about that which is in its own possession? Why should\r\nany surprise be manifested at an arsenal containing arms and\r\ngunpowder?\"--Nothing is of any effect. The chateau is invaded; two\r\nhundred workmen set to work to demolish the fortifications; they listen\r\nonly to their fears, and cannot exercise too great precaution. However\r\ninoffensive the citadels may be, they are held to be dangerous; however\r\naccommodating the commanders may be, they are regarded with suspicion.\r\nThe people chafe against the bridle, relaxed and slack as it is. It\r\nis broken and cast aside, that it may not be used again when occasion\r\nrequires. Each municipal body, each company of the National Guard,\r\nwants to reign on its own plot of ground out of the way of any foreign\r\ncontrol; and this is what is called liberty. Its adversary, therefore,\r\nis the central power. This must be disarmed for fear that it may\r\ninterpose. On all sides, with a sure and persistent instinct, through\r\nthe capture of fortresses, the pillage of arsenals, the seduction of the\r\nsoldiery, and the expulsion of generals, the municipality ensures its\r\nomnipotence by guaranteeing itself beforehand against all repression.\r\n\r\nAt Brest the municipal authorities insist that a naval officer shall be\r\nsurrendered to the people, and on the refusal of the King's lieutenant\r\nto give him up, the permanent committee orders the National Guard to\r\nload its guns.[3120] At Nantes the municipal body refuses to recognize\r\nM. d'Hervilly, sent to take command of a camp, and the towns of the\r\nprovince write to declare that they will suffer no other than the\r\nfederated troops on their territory. At Lille the permanent committee\r\ninsists that the military authorities shall place the keys of the town\r\nin its keeping every evening, and, a few months after this, the National\r\nGuard, joined by mutinous soldiers, seize the citadel and the person of\r\nLivarot, its commander. At Toulon the commander of the arsenal, M.\r\nde Rioms, and several naval officers, are put in the dungeon. At\r\nMontpellier the citadel is surprised, and the club writes to the\r\nNational Assembly to demand its demolition. At Valence, the commandant,\r\nM. de Voisin, on taking measures of defense, is massacred, and\r\nhenceforth the municipality issues all orders to the garrison. At\r\nBastia, Colonel de Rully falls under a shower of bullets, and the\r\nNational Guard takes possession of the citadel and the powder magazine.\r\nThese are not passing outbursts: at the end of two years the same\r\ninsubordinate spirit is apparent everywhere.[3121] In vain do the\r\ncommissioners of the National Assembly seek to transfer the Nassau\r\nregiment from Metz. Sedan refuses to receive it; while Thionville\r\ndeclares that, if it comes, she will blow up the bridges, and Sarrebuis\r\nthreatens, if it approaches, that it will open fire on it. At Caen\r\nneither the municipality nor the directory dares enforce the law which\r\nassigns the castle to the troops of the line; the National Guard refuses\r\nto leave it, and forbids the director of the artillery to inspect the\r\nmunitions.--In this state of things a Government subsists in name\r\nbut not in fact, for it no longer possesses the means of enforcing\r\nobedience. Each commune arrogates to itself the right of suspending\r\nor preventing the execution of the simplest and most urgent orders.\r\nArnay-le-Duc, in spite of passports and legal injunctions, persists in\r\nretaining Mesdames; Arcis-sur-Aube retains Necker, and Montigny is about\r\nto retain M. Caillard, Ambassador of France.[3122]--In the month of\r\nJune, 1791, a convoy of eighty thousand crowns of six livres sets out\r\nfrom Paris for Switzerland; this is a repayment by the French Government\r\nto that of Soleure; the date of payment is fixed, the itinerary marked\r\nout; all the necessary documents are provided; it is important that it\r\nshould arrive on the day when the bill falls due. But they have\r\ncounted without the municipalities and the National Guards. Arrested at\r\nBar-sur-Aube, it is only at the end of a month, and on a decree of the\r\nNational Assembly, that the convoy can resume its march. At Belfort it\r\nis seized again, and it still remains there in the month of November. In\r\nvain has the directory of the Bas-Rhin ordered its release; the Belfort\r\nmunicipality paid no attention to the order. In vain the same directory\r\ndispatches a commissioner, who is near being cut to pieces. The personal\r\ninterference of General Luckner, with the strong arm, is necessary,\r\nbefore the convoy can pass the frontier, after five months of\r\ndelay.[3123] In the month of July 1791, a French vessel on the way from\r\nRouen to Caudebec, said to be loaded with kegs of gold and silver, is\r\nstopped. On the examination being made, it has a right to leave; its\r\npapers are all correct, and the department enjoins the district to\r\nrespect the law. The district, however, replies that it is impossible,\r\nsince \"all the municipalities on the banks of the Seine have armed\r\nand are awaiting the passing of the vessel,\" and the National Assembly\r\nitself is obliged to pass a decree that the vessel shall be discharged.\r\n\r\nIf the rebellion of the small communes is of this stamp, what must be\r\nthat of the larger ones?[3124] The departments and districts summon the\r\nmunicipality in vain; it disobeys or pays no attention to the summons.\r\n\r\n\"Since the session began,\" writes the directory of Saône-et-Loire; \"the\r\nmunicipality of Maçon has taken no step in relation to us which has not\r\nbeen an encroachment. It has not uttered a word, which has not been an\r\ninsult. It has not entered upon a deliberation which has not been an\r\noutrage.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the regiment of Aunis is not ordered here immediately,\" writes the\r\ndirectory of Calvados, \"if prompt and efficient measures are not taken\r\nto provide us with an armed force, we shall abandon a post which we can\r\nnot longer hold due to insubordination, license, contempt for all the\r\nauthorities. We shall in this case be unable to perform the duties which\r\nwere imposed upon us.\"\r\n\r\nThe directory of the Bouches-du-Rhone, on being attacked, flies before\r\nthe bayonets of Marseilles. The members of the directory of Gers, in\r\nconflict with the municipality of Auch, are almost beaten to death. As\r\nto the ministers, who are distrusted by virtue of their office, they are\r\nstill less respected than the directories, They are constantly denounced\r\nto the Assembly, while the municipalities send back their dispatches\r\nwithout deigning to open them,[3125] and, towards the end of 1791, their\r\nincreasing powerlessness ends in complete annihilation. We can judge\r\nof this by one example. In the month of December 1791, Limoges is not\r\nallowed to carry away the grain, which it had just purchased in Indre,\r\na force of sixty horsemen being necessary to protect its transportation.\r\nThe directory of Indre at once calls upon the ministers to furnish them\r\nwith this small troop.[3126] After trying for three weeks, the minister\r\nreplies that it is out of his power; he has knocked at all doors in\r\nvain. \"I have pointed out one way,\" he says, \"to the deputies of your\r\ndepartment in the National Assembly, namely, to withdraw the 20th\r\nregiment of cavalry from Orleans, and I have recommended them to broach\r\nthe matter to the deputies of Loiret.\" The answer is still delayed:\r\nthe deputies of the two departments have to come to an agreement, for,\r\notherwise, the minister dares not displace sixty men to protect a convoy\r\nof grain. It is plain enough that there is no longer any executive\r\npower. There is no longer a central authority. There is no longer a\r\nFrance, but merely so many disintegrated and independent communes, like\r\nOrleans and Limoges, which, through their representatives, carry on\r\nnegotiations with each other, one to secure itself from a deficiency of\r\ntroops, and the other to secure itself from a want of bread.\r\n\r\nLet us consider this general dissolution on the spot, and take up a case\r\nin detail. On the 18th of January 1790, the new municipal authorities\r\nof Marseilles enter upon their duties. As is generally the case, the\r\nmajority of the electors have had nothing to do with the balloting.\r\nThe mayor, Martin, having been elected by only an eighth of the active\r\ncitizens.[3127] If, however, the dominant minority is a small one, it\r\nis resolute and not inclined to stop at trifles. \"Scarcely is it\r\norganized,\"[3128] when it sends deputies to the King to have him\r\nwithdraw his troops from Marseilles. The King, always weak and\r\naccommodating, finally consents; and, the orders to march being\r\nprepared, the municipality is duly advised of them. But the municipality\r\nwill tolerate no delay, and immediately \"draws up, prints, and issues\r\na denunciation to the National Assembly\" against the commandant and\r\nthe two ministers who, according to it, are guilty of having forged or\r\nsuppressed the King's orders. In the meantime it equips and fortifies\r\nitself as for a combat. At its first establishment the municipality\r\nbroke up the bourgeois guard, which was too great a lover of order, and\r\norganized a National Guard, in which those who have no property are\r\nsoon to be admitted. \"Daily additions are made to its military\r\napparatus;[3129] entrenchments and barricades at the Hôtel-de-Ville,\r\nare increasing, the artillery is increased; the town is filled with the\r\nexcitement of a military camp in the immediate presence of an enemy.\"\r\nThus, in possession of force, it makes use of it, and in the first place\r\nagainst justice.--A popular insurrection had been suppressed in the\r\nmonth of August 1789, and the three principal leaders, Rebecqui, Pascal,\r\nand Granet, had been imprisoned in the Chateau d'If. They are the\r\nfriends of the municipal authorities, and they must be set free. At\r\nthe demand of this body the affair is taken out of the hands of the\r\ngrand-prévôt and put into those of the sénéchaussée, the former,\r\nmeanwhile, together with his councilors, undergoing punishment for\r\nhaving performed their duty. The municipality, on its own authority,\r\nforbids them from further exercise of their functions. They are publicly\r\ndenounced, \"threatened with poniards, the scaffold, and every species of\r\nassassination.\" [3130] No printer dares publish their defense, for fear\r\nof \"municipal annoyances.\" It is not long before the royal procureur and\r\na councillor are reduced to seeking refuge in Fort Saint-Jean, while the\r\ngrand-prévôt after having resisted a little longer, leaves Marseilles\r\nin order to save his life. As to the three imprisoned men, the municipal\r\nauthorities visit them in a body and demand their provisional release.\r\nOne of them having made his escape, they refuse to give the commandant\r\nthe order for his re-arrest. The other two triumphantly leave the\r\nchateau on the 11th of April, escorted by eight hundred National Guards.\r\nThey go, for form's sake, to the prisons of the sénéchaussée but the\r\nnext day are set at liberty, and further prosecution ceases. As an\r\noffset to this, M. d'Ambert, colonel in the Royal Marine, guilty of\r\nexpressing himself too warmly against the National Guard, although\r\nacquitted by the tribunal before which he was brought, can be set\r\nat liberty only in secret and under the protection of two thousand\r\nsoldiers. The populace want to burn the house of the criminal lieutenant\r\nthat dared absolve him. The magistrate himself is in danger, and is\r\nforced to take refuge in the house of the military commander.[3131]\r\nMeanwhile, printed and written papers, insulting libels by the municipal\r\nbody and the club, the seditious or violent discussions of the district\r\nassemblies, and a lot of pamphlets, are freely distributed among the\r\npeople and the soldiers: the latter are purposely stirred up in advance\r\nagainst their chiefs.--In vain are the officers mild, conciliatory, and\r\ncautious. In vain does the commander-in-chief depart with a portion of\r\nthe troops. The object now is to dislodge the regiment occupying\r\nthe three forts. The club sets the ball in motion, and, forcibly or\r\notherwise, the will of the people must be carried out. On the 29th of\r\nApril, two actors, supported by fifty volunteers, surprise a sentinel\r\nand get possession of Notre-Dame de la Garde. On the same day,\r\nsix thousand National Guards invest the forts of Saint-Jean and\r\nSaint-Nicolas. The municipal authorities, summoned to respect the\r\nfortresses, reply by demanding the opening of the gates to the National\r\nGuard, that it may do duty jointly with the soldiers. The commandants\r\nhesitate, refer to the law, and demand time to consult their superiors.\r\nA second requisition, more urgent, is made; the commandants are held\r\nresponsible for the disturbances they provoke by their refusal. If they\r\nresist they are declared promoters of civil war.[3132] They accordingly\r\nyield and sign a capitulation. One among them, the Chevalier de\r\nBeausset, major in Fort Saint-Jean, is opposed to this, and refuses his\r\nsignature. On the following day he is seized as he is about to enter the\r\nHôtel-de-Ville, and massacred, his head being borne about on the end of\r\na pike, while the band of assassins, the soldiers, and the rabble dance\r\nabout and shout over his remains.--\" It is a sad accident,\" writes the\r\nmunicipality.[3133] How does it happen that, \"after having thus far\r\nmerited and obtained all praise, a Beausset, whom we were unable to\r\nprotect against the decrees of Providence, should sully our laurels?\r\nHaving had nothing to do with this tragic affair, it is not for us\r\nto prosecute the authors of it.\" Moreover, he was \"culpable. . ..\r\nrebellious, condemned by public opinion, and Providence itself seems to\r\nhave abandoned him to the irrevocable decrees of its vengeance.\"--As to\r\nthe taking of the forts, nothing is more legitimate. \"These places were\r\nin the hands of the enemies of the State, while now they are in the\r\nhands of the defenders of the Constitution of the empire. Woe to\r\nwhoever would take them from us again, to convert them into a focus of\r\ncounter-revolution \"--M. de Miran, commandant of the province, has, it\r\nis true, made a demand for them. But, \"is it not somewhat pitiable to\r\nsee the requisition of a Sieur de Miran, made in the name of the King he\r\nbetrays, to surrender to his Majesty's troops places which, henceforth\r\nin our hands, guarantee public security to the nation, to the law, and\r\nto the King?\" In vain does the King, at the request of the National\r\nAssembly,[3134] order the municipality to restore the forts to the\r\ncommandants, and to make the National Guards leave them. The municipal\r\nauthorities become indignant, and resist. According to them the wrong\r\nis all on the side of the commandant and the ministers. It is the\r\ncommandants who, \"with the threatening equipment of their citadels,\r\ntheir stores of provisions and of artillery, are disturbers of the\r\npublic peace. What does the minister mean by driving the national troops\r\nout of the forts, in order to entrust their guardianship to foreign\r\ntroops? His object is apparent in this plan. . . . he wants to kindle\r\ncivil war.\"--\"All the misfortunes of Marseilles originate in the secret\r\nunder-standing existing between the ministers and the enemies of the\r\nState.\" The municipal corps is at last obliged to evacuate the forts,\r\nbut it is determined not to give them up. The day following that on\r\nwhich it receives the decree of the National Assembly, it conceives the\r\ndesign of demolishing them. On the 17th of May, two hundred laborers,\r\npaid in advance, begin the work of destruction. To save appearances the\r\nmunicipal body betakes itself at eleven o'clock in the morning to the\r\ndifferent localities, and orders them to stop. But, on its departure,\r\nthe laborers keep on; and, at six o'clock in the evening, a resolution\r\nis passed that, \"to prevent the entire demolition of the citadel, it\r\nis deemed advisable to authorize only that of the part overlooking the\r\ntown.\" On the 18th of May the Jacobin club, at once agent, accomplice,\r\nand councilor of the municipal body, compels private individuals to\r\ncontribute something towards defraying the expenses of the demolition.\r\nIt \"sends round to every house, and to the syndics of all corporations,\r\nexacting their quotas, and making all citizens subscribe a document by\r\nwhich they appear to sanction the action of the municipal body, and to\r\nexpress their thanks to it. People had to sign it, pay, and keep silent.\r\nWoe to any one that refused!\" On the 20th of May the municipal body\r\npresumes to write to the Assembly, that \"this threatening citadel, this\r\nodious monument of a stupendous despotism, is about to disappear.\" To\r\njustify its disobedience, it takes occasion to remark, \"that the love of\r\ncountry is the most powerful and most enduring of an empire's ramparts.\"\r\nOn the 28th of May it secures the performance in two theaters of a piece\r\nrepresenting the capture of the forts of Marseilles, for the benefit\r\nof the men engaged in their demolition. Meanwhile, it has summoned\r\nthe Paris Jacobins to its support; it has proposed to invite the Lyons\r\nfederation and all the municipalities of the kingdom to denounce the\r\nminister. It has forced M. de Miran, threatened with death and watched\r\nby a party in ambush on the road, to quit Aix, and then demands his\r\nrecall.[3135] Only on the 6th of June does it decide, at the express\r\ncommand of the National Assembly, to suspend the almost completed\r\ndemolition.--Authorities to which obedience is due could not be treated\r\nmore insolently. The end, however, is attained; there is no longer a\r\ncitadel, and the troops have departed; the regiment commanded by Ernest\r\nalone remains, to be tampered with, insulted, and then sent off. It is\r\nordered to Aix, and the National Guard of Marseilles will go there to\r\ndisarm and disband it. Henceforth the municipal body has full sway. It\r\n\"observes only those laws which suit it, makes others to its own liking,\r\nand, in short, governs in the most despotic and arbitrary manner.\"[3136]\r\nAnd not only at Marseilles, but throughout the department where, under\r\nno authority but its own, it undertakes armed expeditions and makes\r\nraids and sudden attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--Independent Assemblies.\r\n\r\n     Why they took the initiative.--The people in council.\r\n     --Powerlessness of the municipalities.--the violence to which\r\n     they are subject.--Aix in 1790.--Government disobeyed and\r\n     perverted everywhere.\r\n\r\nWere it but possible for the dissolution to stop here! But each commune\r\nis far from being a tranquil little state under the rule of a body\r\nof respected magistrates. The same causes which render municipalities\r\nrebellious against the central authority render individuals rebellious\r\nagainst local authority. They also feel that they are in danger and\r\nwant to provide for their own safety. They also, in virtue of the\r\nConstitution and of circumstances, believe themselves appointed to\r\nsave the country. They also consider themselves qualified to judge for\r\nthemselves on all points and entitled to carry out their judgments with\r\ntheir own hands. The shopkeeper, workman or peasant, at once elector and\r\nNational Guard, furnished with his vote and a musket, suddenly becomes\r\nthe equal and master of his superiors; instead of obeying, he commands,\r\nwhile all who see him again after some years' absence, find that \"in\r\nhis demeanor and manner all is changed.\" \"There was great agitation\r\neverywhere,\"[3137] says M. de Ségur; \"I noticed groups of men talking\r\nearnestly in the streets and on the squares. The sound of the drum\r\nstruck my ear in the villages, while I was astonished at the great\r\nnumber of armed men I encountered in the little towns. On interrogating\r\nvarious persons among the lower classes they would reply with a proud\r\nlook and in a bold and confident tone. I observed everywhere the effect\r\nof those sentiments of equality and liberty which had then become\r\nsuch violent passions.\"--Thus exalted in their own eyes they believed\r\nthemselves qualified to take the lead in everything, not only in local\r\naffairs, but also in general matters. France is to be governed by them;\r\nby virtue of the Constitution they arrogate to themselves the right,\r\nand, by dint of ignorance, attribute to themselves the capacity, to\r\ngovern it. A torrent of new, shapeless, and disproportionate ideas have\r\ntaken possession of their brains in the space of a few months. Vast\r\ninterests about which they have never thought, have to be considered.\r\nGovernment, royalty, the church, creeds, foreign powers, internal\r\nand external dangers, what is occurring at Paris and at Coblentz, the\r\ninsurrection in the Low Countries, the acts of the cabinets of London,\r\nVienna, Madrid, Berlin; and, of all this, they inform themselves as they\r\nbest can. An officer,[3138] who traverses France at this time, narrates\r\nthat at the post-stations they made him wait for horses until he had\r\n\"given them details. The peasants stopped my carriage in the middle of\r\nthe road and overwhelmed me with questions. At Autun, I was obliged, in\r\nspite of the cold, to talk out of a window opening upon the square and\r\ntell what I knew about the Assembly.\"--These on-dits are all changed\r\nand amplified in passing from mouth to mouth. They finally become\r\ncircumstantial stories adapted to the caliber of the minds they pass\r\ninto and to the dominant passion that propagates them. Trace the effect\r\nof these fables in the house of a peasant or fish-woman in an outlying\r\nvillage or a populous suburb, on brutish or almost brutal minds,\r\nespecially when they are lively, heated, and over-excited--the effect\r\nis tremendous. For, in minds of this stamp, belief is at once converted\r\ninto action, and into rude and destructive action. It is an acquired\r\nself-control, reflection, and culture which interposes between belief\r\nand action the solicitude for social interests, the observance of forms\r\nand respect for the law. These restraints are all wanting in the new\r\nsovereign. He does not know how to stop and will not suffer himself to\r\nbe stopped. Why so many delays when the peril is urgent? What is the use\r\nof observing formalities when the safety of the people is at stake? What\r\nis there sacred in the law when it protects public enemies? What is more\r\npernicious than passive deference and patient waiting under timid or\r\nblind officials? What can be more just than to do one's self justice\r\nat once and on the spot?--Precipitation and passion, in their eyes,\r\nare both duties and merits. One day \"the militia of Lorient decide upon\r\nmarching to Versailles and to Paris without considering how they are to\r\nget over the ground or what they will do on their arrival.\"[3139] Were\r\nthe central government within reach they would lay their hands on it.\r\nIn default of this they substitute themselves for it on their own\r\nterritory, and exercise its functions with a full conviction of right,\r\nprincipally those of gendarme, judge, and executioner.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of October, 1789, at Paris, after the assassination of\r\nthe baker François, the leading murderer, who is a porter at the grain\r\ndepot, declares \"that he wanted to avenge the nation.\" It is quite\r\nprobable that this declaration is sincere. In his mind, assassination is\r\none of the forms of patriotism, and it does not take long for his way\r\nof thinking to become prevalent. In ordinary times, social and political\r\nideas slumber in uncultured minds in the shape of vague antipathies,\r\nrestrained aspirations, and fleeting desires. Behold them\r\naroused--energetic, imperious, stubborn, and unbridled. Objection or\r\nopposition is not to be tolerated; dissent, with them, is a sure sign\r\nof treachery.--Apropos of the nonjuring priests,[3140] five hundred and\r\ntwenty-seven of the National Guards of Arras write, \"that no one could\r\ndoubt their iniquity without being suspected of being their accomplices.\r\n. . . Should the whole town combine and express a contrary opinion, it\r\nwould simply show that it is filled with enemies of the Constitution;\"\r\nand forthwith, in spite of the law and the remonstrances of\r\nthe authorities, they insist on the closing of the churches. At\r\nBoulogne-sur-Mer, an English vessel having shipped a quantity of\r\npoultry, game, and eggs, \"the National Guards, of their own authority,\"\r\ngo on board and remove the cargo. On the strength of this, the\r\naccommodating municipal body approves of the act, declares the cargo\r\nconfiscated, orders it to be sold, and awards one-half of the proceeds\r\nto the National Guards and the other half to charitable purposes. The\r\nconcession is a vain one, for the National Guards consider that one-half\r\nis too little, \"insult and threaten the municipal officers,\" and\r\nimmediately proceed to divide the booty in kind, each one going home\r\nwith a share of stolen hams and chickens.[3141] The magistrates must\r\nnecessarily keep quiet with the guns of those they govern pointed at\r\nthem.--Sometimes, and it is generally the case, they are timid, and\r\ndo not try to resist. At Douai,[3142] the municipal officers, on being\r\nsummoned three times to proclaim martial law, refuse, and end by avowing\r\nthat they dare not unfold the red flag: \"Were we to take this course\r\nwe should all be sacrificed on the spot.\" Neither the troops nor the\r\nNational Guards, in fact, are to be relied on. In this universal\r\nstate of apathy the field is open to savages, and a dealer in wheat is\r\nhung.--Sometimes the administrative corps tries to resist, but in the\r\nend it has to succumb to violence. \"For more than six hours,\" writes one\r\nof the members of the district of Etampes,[3143] \"we were closed in by\r\nbayonets leveled at us and with pistols at our breasts; and they were\r\nobliged to sign a dismissal of the troops which had arrived to protect\r\nthe market. At present \"we are all away from Etampes; there is no\r\nlonger a district or a municipality;\" almost all have handed in their\r\nresignations, or are to return for that purpose.--Sometimes, and this\r\nis the rarest case,[3144] the officials do their duty to the end, and\r\nperish. In this same town, six months later, Simoneau, the mayor,\r\nhaving refused to cut down the price of wheat, is beaten with\r\niron-pointed sticks, and his corpse is riddled with balls by the\r\nmurderers.--Municipal bodies must take heed how they undertake to stem\r\nthe torrent; the slightest opposition will soon be at the expense of\r\ntheir lives. In Touraine,[3145] \"as the publication of the tax-rolls\r\ntakes place, riots break out against the municipal authorities; they are\r\nforced to surrender the rolls they have drawn up, and their papers are\r\ntorn up.\" And still more, \"they kill, they assassinate the municipal\r\nauthorities.\" In that large commune men and women \"beat and kick them\r\nwith their fists and sabots. . . . The mayor is laid up after it, and\r\nthe procureur of the commune died between nine and ten o'clock in the\r\nmorning. Véteau, a municipal officer, received the last sacrament this\r\nmorning;\" the rest have fled, being constantly threatened with death and\r\nincendiarism. They do not, consequently, return, and \"no one now will\r\ntake the office of either mayor or administrator.\"--The outrages which\r\nthe municipalities thus commit against their superiors are committed\r\nagainst themselves. The National Guards, the mob, the controlling\r\nfaction, arrogating to themselves in the commune the same violent\r\nsovereignty which the commune pretends to exercise against the State.\r\n\r\nI should never finish if I undertook to enumerate the outbreaks in\r\nwhich the magistrates are constrained to tolerate or to sanction popular\r\nusurpations, to shut up churches, to drive off or imprison priests, to\r\nsuppress octrois, tax grain, and allow clerks; bakers, corn-dealers,\r\necclesiastics, nobles, and officers to be hung, beaten to death, or\r\nto have their throats cut. Ninety-four thick files of records in the\r\nnational archives are filled with these acts of violence, and do not\r\ncontain two-thirds of them. It is worth while to take in detail one\r\ncase more, a special one, and one that is authentic, which serves as a\r\nspecimen, and which presents a foreshortened image of France during\r\none tranquil year. At Aix, in the month of December, 1790,[3146] in\r\nOpposition to the two Jacobin clubs, a club had been organized, had\r\ncomplied with all the formalities, and, like the \"Club des Monarchiens\"\r\nat Paris, claimed the same right of meeting as the others. But here, as\r\nat Paris, the Jacobins recognize no rights but for themselves alone,\r\nand refuse to admit their adversaries to the privileges of the law.\r\nMoreover, alarming rumors are circulated. A person who has arrived\r\nfrom Nice states that he had \"heard that there were twenty thousand men\r\nbetween Turin and Nice, under the pay of the emigrants, and that at\r\nNice a neuvaine[3147] was held in Saint François-de-Paule to pray God to\r\nenlighten the French.\" A counter-revolution is certainly under way.\r\nSome of the aristocrats have stated \"with an air of triumph, that the\r\nNational Guard and municipalities are a mere toy, and that this sort of\r\nthing will not last long.\" One of the leading members of the new club,\r\nM. de Guiraitiand, an old officer of seventy-eight years, makes speeches\r\nin public against the National Assembly, tries to enlist artisans in his\r\nparty, \"affects to wear a white button on his hat fastened by pins with\r\ntheir points jutting out,\" and, as it is stated, he has given to several\r\nmercers a large order for white cockades. In reality, on examination,\r\nnot one is found in any shop, and all the dealers in ribbons, on\r\nbeing interrogated, reply that they know of no transaction of that\r\ndescription. But this simply proves that the culprit is a clever\r\ndissimulator, and the more dangerous because he is eager to save the\r\ncountry.--On the 12th of December, at four o'clock in the afternoon,\r\nthe two Jacobin clubs fraternise, and pass in long procession before\r\nthe place of meeting, \"where some of the members, a few officers of the\r\nLyons regiment and other individuals, are quietly engaged at play\r\nor seeing others play.\" The crowd hoot, but they remain quiet. The\r\nprocession passes by again, and they hoot and shout, \"Down with the\r\naristocrats to the lamp post with them!\" Two or three of the officers\r\nstanding on the threshold of the door become irritated, and one of them,\r\ndrawing his sword, threatens to strike a young man if he keeps on. Upon\r\nthis the crowd cries out, \"Guard! Help! An assassin!\" and rushes at\r\nthe officer, who withdraws into the house, exclaiming, \"To arms!\" His\r\ncomrades, sword in hand, descend in order to defend the door; M. de\r\nGuiramand fires two pistol shots and receives a stab in the thigh. A\r\nshower of stones smashes in the windows, and the door is on the point of\r\nbeing burst open when several of the members of the club save themselves\r\nby taking to the roof. About a dozen others, most of them officers,\r\nform in line, penetrate the crowd with uplifted swords, strike and get\r\nstruck, and escape, five of them being wounded. The municipality orders\r\nthe doors and windows of the club-house to be walled up, sends the\r\nLyons regiment away, decrees the arrest of seven officers and of M. de\r\nGuiramand, and all this in a few hours, with no other testimony than\r\nthat of the conquerors.\r\n\r\nBut these prompt, vigorous and partial measures are not sufficient for\r\nthe Jacobin club; other conspirators must be seized, and it is the club\r\nwhich designates them and goes to take them.--Three months before\r\nthis, M. Pascalis, an advocate, on addressing along with some of his\r\nprofessional brethren the dissolved parliament, deplored the blindness\r\nof the people, \"exalted by prerogatives of which they knew not the\r\ndanger.\" A man who dared talk in this way is evidently a traitor.--There\r\nis another, M. Morellet de la Roquette, who refused to join the\r\nproscribed club. His former vassals, however, had been obliged to bring\r\nan action against him to make him accept the redemption of his feudal\r\ndues; also, six years before this, his carriage, passing along the\r\npublic promenade, had run over a child; he likewise is an enemy of the\r\npeople. While the municipal officers are deliberating, \"a few members of\r\nthe club\" get together and decide that M. Pascalis and M. de la Roquette\r\nmust be arrested. At eleven o'clock at night eighty trustworthy National\r\nGuards, led by the president of the club, travel a league off to seize\r\nthem in their beds and lodge them in the town prison.--Zeal of this kind\r\nexcites some uneasiness, and if the municipality tolerates the arrests,\r\nit is because it is desirous of preventing murder. Consequently, on the\r\nfollowing day, December 13th, it sends to Marseilles for four hundred\r\nmen of the Swiss Guard commanded by Ernest, and four hundred National\r\nGuards, adding to these the National Guard of Aix, and orders this\r\ncompany to protect the prison against any violence. But, along with the\r\nMarseilles National Guards, there came a lot of armed people who are\r\nvolunteers of disorder. On the afternoon of the 13th the first mob\r\nstrives to force the prison, and the next day, fresh squads congregate\r\naround it demanding the head of M. Pascalis. The members of the club\r\nhead the riot with \"a crowd of unknown men from outside the town, who\r\ngive orders and carry them out.\" During the night the populace of Aix\r\nare tampered with, and the dikes all give way at the same moment. At the\r\nfirst clamors the National Guard on duty on the public promenade disband\r\nand disperse, while, as there is no signal for the assemblage of the\r\nothers, notwithstanding the regulations, the general alarm is not\r\nsounded. \"The largest portion of the National Guard draws off so as not\r\nto appear to authorize by its presence outrages which it has not been\r\nordered to prevent. Peaceable Citizens are in great consternation;\" each\r\none takes to flight or shuts himself up in his house, the streets being\r\ndeserted and silent. Meanwhile the prison gates are shattered with axes.\r\nThe procureur-syndic of the department, who requests the commandant of\r\nthe Swiss regiment to protect the prisoners, is seized, borne off, and\r\nruns the risk of losing his life. Three municipal officers in their\r\nscarves, who arrive on the ground, dare not give the order required by\r\nthe commandant. At this decisive moment, when it is necessary to\r\nshed blood and kill a number of men, they obviously fear to take\r\nthe responsibility; their reply is, \"We have no orders to give.\"--An\r\nextraordinary spectacle now presents itself in this barrack courtyard\r\nsurrounding the prison. On the side of the law stand eight hundred armed\r\nmen, four hundred of the \"Swiss\" and four hundred of the National Guard\r\nof Marseilles. They are drawn up in battle array, with guns to their\r\nshoulders, with special orders repeated the evening before at three\r\ndifferent times by the municipal district and departmental authorities\r\nand they have the sympathies of all honest people and of most of the\r\nNational Guard. But the legal indispensable phrase does not pass the\r\nlips of those who by virtue of the Constitution should utter it, and a\r\nsmall group of convicts are found to be sovereign.--The three municipal\r\nofficers are seized in their turn under the eyes of their own soldiers\r\nwho remain motionless, and \"with bayonets at their breasts they sign,\r\nunder constraint, the order to give up M. Pascalis to the people.\" M. de\r\nla Roquette is likewise surrendered. \"The only portion of the National\r\nGuard of Aix which was visible,\" that is to say, the Jacobin minority,\r\nform a circle around the gate of the prison and organize themselves into\r\na council of war. And there they stand; at once \"accusers, witnesses,\r\njudges, and executioners.\" A captain conducts the two victims to the\r\npublic promenade where they are hung. Very soon after this old M.\r\nde Guiramand, whom the National Guard of his village have brought a\r\nprisoner to Aix, is hung in the same manner.\r\n\r\nThere is no prosecution of the assassins. The new tribunal, frightened\r\nor forestalled, has for some time back ranged itself on the popular\r\nside; its writs, consequently, are served on the oppressed, against\r\nthe members of the assaulted dub. Writs of arrest, summonses to attend\r\ncourt, searches, seizures of correspondence, and other proceedings,\r\nrain down upon them. Three hundred witnesses are examined. Some of the\r\narrested officers are \"loaded with chains and thrust into dungeons.\"\r\nHenceforth the club rules, and \"makes everybody tremble.\"[3148] \"From\r\nthe 23rd to the 27th of December, more than ten thousand passports\r\nare delivered at Aix.\" \"If the emigrations continue,\" write the\r\ncommissioners, \"there will be no one left at Aix but workmen without\r\nwork and with no resources. Whole streets are uninhabited. . . . . As\r\nlong as such crimes can be permitted with impunity fear will drive out\r\nof this town every one who has the means of living elsewhere.\"--Many\r\ncome back after the arrival of the commissioners, hoping to obtain\r\njustice and security through them. But, \"if a prosecution is not\r\nordered, we shall scarcely have departed from Aix when three or four\r\nhundred families will abandon it. . . . And what man in his senses would\r\ndare guarantee that each village will not soon have some one hung in\r\nit?. . . Country valets arrest their masters. . . . The expectation\r\nof impunity leads the inhabitants of villages to commit all sorts of\r\ndepredations in the forests, which is very harmful in a region where\r\nwoods are very scarce. They set up the most absurd and most unjust\r\npretensions against rich proprietors, and the fatal rope is ever the\r\ninterpreter and the signal of their will.\" There is no refuge against\r\nthese outrages. \"The department, the districts, the municipalities,\r\nadminister only in conformity with the multiplied petitions of the\r\nclub.\" In the sight of all, and on one solemn day, a crushing defeat\r\nhas demonstrated the weakness of the government officials; and, bowed\r\nbeneath the yoke of their new masters, they preserve their legal\r\nauthority only on the condition that it remains at the service of the\r\nvictorious party.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3101: Festivals approving the federation of all the National\r\nGuards in France.

SOVEREIGNTY OF UNRESTRAINED PASSIONS.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions when passions are freed; any determined and\r\ncompetent man who can gather a couple of hundred men may form a band\r\nand slip through the enlarged or weakened meshes of the net held by the\r\npassive or ineffective government. An experiment on a grand scale\r\nis about to be made on human society; owing to the slackening of the\r\nregular restraints which have maintained it, it is now possible to\r\nmeasure the force of the permanent instincts which attack it. They are\r\nalways there even in ordinary times; we do not notice them because they\r\nare kept in check; but they are not the less energetic and effective,\r\nand, moreover, indestructible. The moment their repression ceases,\r\ntheir power of mischief becomes evident; just as that of the water which\r\nfloats a ship, but which, at the first leak enters into it and sinks it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--Old Religious Grudges\r\n\r\n     Montauban and Nîmes in 1790.\r\n\r\nReligious passions, to begin with, are not to be kept down by\r\nfederations, embraces, and effusions of fraternity. In the south, where\r\nthe Protestants have been persecuted for more than a century, hatreds\r\nexist more than a century old.[3201] In vain have the odious edicts\r\nwhich oppressed them fallen into desuetude for the past twenty years; in\r\nvain have civil rights been restored to them since 1787: The past still\r\nlives in transmitted recollections; and two groups are confronting each\r\nother, one Protestant and the other Catholic, each defiant, hostile,\r\nready to act on the defensive, and interpreting the preparations of its\r\nadversary as a plan of attack. Under such circumstances the guns go off\r\nof their own accord.--On a sudden alarm at Uzès[3202] the Catholics,\r\ntwo thousand in number, take possession of the bishop's palace and the\r\nHôtel-de-Ville; while the Protestants, numbering four hundred, assemble\r\noutside the walls on the esplanade, and pass the night under arms,\r\neach troop persuaded that the other is going to massacre it, one\r\nparty summoning the Catholics of Jalès to its aid, and the other the\r\nProtestants of Gardonnenque.--There is but one way of avoiding civil war\r\nbetween parties in such an attitude, and that is the ascendancy of an\r\nenergetic third party, impartial and on the spot. A plan to this\r\neffect, which promises well, is proposed by the military commandant of\r\nLanguedoc.[3203] According to him the two firebrands are, on the\r\none hand, the bishops of Lower Languedoc, and on the other, MM.\r\nRabaut-Saint-Etienne, father and two sons, all three being pastors. Let\r\nthem be responsible \"with their heads\" for any mob, insurrection, or\r\nattempt to debauch the army; let a tribunal of twelve judges be selected\r\nfrom the municipal bodies of twelve towns, and all delinquents be\r\nbrought before it; let this be the court of final appeal, and its\r\nsentence immediately executed. The system in vogue, however, is just the\r\nreverse. Both parties being organized into a body of militia, each takes\r\ncare of itself, and is sure to fire on the other; and the more readily,\r\ninasmuch as the new ecclesiastical regulations, which are issued from\r\nmonth to month, strike like so many hammers on Catholic sensibility, and\r\nscatter showers of sparks on the primings of the already loaded guns.\r\n\r\nAt Montauban, on the 10th of May, 1790, the day of the inventory and\r\nexpropriation of the religious communities,[3204] the commissioners\r\nare not allowed to enter. Women in a state of frenzy lie across the\r\nthresholds of the doors, and it would be necessary to pass over their\r\nbodies; a large mob gathers around the \"Cordeliers,\" and a petition is\r\nsigned to have the convents maintained.--The Protestants who witness\r\nthis commotion become alarmed, and eighty of their National Guards march\r\nto the Hôtel-de-Ville, and take forcible possession of the guard-house\r\nwhich protects it. The municipal authorities order them to withdraw,\r\nwhich they refuse to do. Thereupon the Catholics assembled at the\r\n\"Cordeliers\" begin a riot, throw stones, and drive in the doors with\r\npieces of timber, while a cry is heard that the Protestants, who have\r\ntaken refuge in the guard-house, are firing from the windows. The\r\nenraged multitude immediately invade the arsenal, seize all the guns\r\nthey can lay their hands on, and fire volleys on the guard-house, the\r\neffect of which is to kill five of the Protestants and wound twenty-four\r\nothers. The rest are saved by a municipal officer and the police; but\r\nthey are obliged to appear, two and two, before the cathedral in their\r\nshirts, and do public penance, after which they are put in prison.\r\nDuring the tumult political shouts have been heard: \"Hurrah for the\r\nnobles! Hurrah for the aristocracy! Down with the nation! Down with the\r\ntricolor flag!\" Bordeaux, regarding Montauban as in rebellion against\r\nFrance, dispatches fifteen hundred of its National Guard to set the\r\nprisoners free. Toulouse gives its aid to Bordeaux. The fermentation is\r\nfrightful. Four thousand of the Protestants of Montauban take flight;\r\narmed cities are about to contend with each other, as formerly in Italy.\r\nIt is necessary that a commissioner of the National Assembly and of\r\nthe King, Mathieu Dumas, should be dispatched to harangue the people of\r\nMontauban, obtain the release of the prisoners, and re-establish order.\r\n\r\nOne month after this a more bloody affray takes place at Nîmes[3205]\r\nagainst the Catholics. The Protestants, in fact, are but twelve thousand\r\nout of fifty-four thousand inhabitants, but the principal trade of the\r\nplace is in their hands; they hold the manufactories and support thirty\r\nthousand workmen; in the elections of 1789 they furnished five out of\r\nthe eight deputies. The sympathies of that time were in their favor;\r\nnobody then imagined that the dominant Church was exposed to any\r\nrisk. It is to be attacked in its turn, and the two parties are seen\r\nconfronting each other.--The Catholics sign a petition,[3206] hunt up\r\nrecruits among the market-gardeners of the suburbs, retain the white\r\ncockade, and, when this is prohibited, replace it with a red rosette,\r\nanother sign of recognition. At their head is an energetic man named\r\nFroment, who has vast projects in view; but as the soil on which he\r\ntreads is undermined, he cannot prevent the explosion. It takes place\r\nnaturally, by chance, through the simple collision of two equally\r\ndistrustful bodies; and before the final day it has commenced and\r\nrecommenced twenty times, through mutual provocations and denunciations,\r\nthrough insults, libels, scuffles, stone-throwing, and gun-shots.--On\r\nthe 13th of June, 1790, the question is which party shall furnish\r\nadministrators for the district and department, and the conflict begins\r\nin relation to the elections. The Electoral Assembly is held at the\r\nguard-house of the bishop's palace, where the Protestant dragoons and\r\npatriots have come \"three times as many as usual, with loaded muskets\r\nand pistols, and with full cartridge-boxes,\" and they patrol the\r\nsurrounding neighborhood. On their side, the red rosettes, royalists\r\nand Catholics, complain of being threatened and \"treated contemptuously\"\r\n(nargués). They give notice to the gate-keeper \"not to let any dragoon\r\nenter the town either on foot or mounted, at the peril of his life,\" and\r\ndeclare that \"the bishop's quarters were not made for a guard-house.\"--A\r\nmob forms, and shouting takes place under the windows; stones are\r\nthrown; the bugle of a dragoon, who sounds the roll-call, is broken and\r\ntwo shots are fired.[3207] The dragoons immediately fire a volley, which\r\nwounds a good many people and kills seven. From this moment, firing goes\r\non during the evening and all night, in every quarter of the town, each\r\nparty believing that the other wants to exterminate it, the Protestants\r\nsatisfied that it is another St. Bartholomew, and the Catholics that\r\nit is \"a Michelade.\"[3208] There is no one to act between them. The\r\nmunicipality authorities, far from issuing orders, receive them: they\r\nare roughly handled, hustled and jostled about, and made to march about\r\nlike servants. The patriots seize the Abbé de Belmont, a municipal\r\nofficer, at the Hôtel-de-Ville, order him, on pain of death, to proclaim\r\nmartial--law, and place the red flag in his hand. \"March, rascal, you\r\nbastard! Hold up your flag--higher up still--you are big enough to do\r\nthat!\" Blows follow with the but-ends of their muskets. The poor man\r\nspits blood, but this is of no consequence; he must be in full sight at\r\nthe head of the crowd, like a target, whilst his conductors prudently\r\nremain behind. Thus does he advance, exposed to bullets, holding the\r\nflag, and finally becomes the prisoner of the red rosettes, who release\r\nhim, but keep his flag. There is a second march with a red flag held\r\nby a town valet, and fresh gunshots; the red rosettes capture this flag\r\nalso, as well as another municipal officer. The rest of the municipal\r\nbody, with a royal commissioner, take refuge in the barracks and order\r\nout the troops. Meanwhile Froment, with his three companies, posted\r\nin their towers and in the houses on the ramparts, resist to the last\r\nextremity. Daylight comes, the tocsin is sounded, the drums beat to\r\narms, and the patriot militia of the neighborhood, the Protestants from\r\nthe mountains, the rude Cévenols, arrive in crowds. The red rosettes are\r\nbesieged; a Capuchin convent, from which it is pretended that they have\r\nfired, is sacked, and five of the monks are killed. Froment's tower is\r\ndemolished with cannon and taken by assault. His brother is massacred\r\nand thrown from the walls, while a Jacobin convent next to the ramparts\r\nis sacked. Towards night, all the red rosettes who have fought are slain\r\nor have fled, and there is no longer any resistance.--But the fury still\r\nlasts; the fifteen thousand rustics who have flooded the town think\r\nthat they have not yet done enough. In vain are they told that the other\r\nfifteen companies of red rosettes have not moved; that the pretended\r\naggressors \"did not even put themselves in a state of defense;\" that\r\nduring the battle they remained at home, and that afterwards, through\r\nextra precaution, the municipal authorities had made them give up their\r\narms. In vain does the Electoral Assembly, preceded by a white flag,\r\nmarch to the public square and exhort the people to keep the peace.\r\n\"Under the pretext of searching suspicious houses, they pillage or\r\ndestroy, and what-ever cannot be carried away is broken.\" One hundred\r\nand twenty houses are sacked in Nîmes alone, while the same ravages\r\nare committed in the environs, the damage, at the end of three days,\r\namounting to seven or eight hundred thousand livres. A number of poor\r\ncreatures, workmen, merchants, old and infirm men, are massacred in\r\ntheir houses; some, \"who have been bedridden for many years, are\r\ndragged to the sills of their doors to be shot.\" Others are hung on the\r\nesplanade and at the Cours Neuf, while others have their noses, ears,\r\nfeet, and hands cut off; and are hacked to pieces with sabers and\r\nscythes. Horrible stories, as is commonly the case, provoke the most\r\natrocious acts.\r\n\r\nA publican, who refuses to distribute anti-Catholic lists, is supposed\r\nto have a mine in his cellar filled with kegs of gunpowder and with\r\nsulfur matches all ready; he is hacked to pieces with a saber, and\r\ntwenty guns are discharged into his corpse: they expose the body before\r\nhis house with a long loaf of bread on his breast, and they again stab\r\nhim with bayonets, saying to him: \"Eat, you bastard, eat\"--More than\r\nfive hundred Catholics were assassinated, and many others, covered with\r\nblood, \"are crowded together in the prisons, while the search for the\r\nproscribed is continued; whenever they are seen, they are fired upon\r\nlike so many wolves.\" Thousands of the inhabitants, accordingly, demand\r\ntheir passports and leave the town. The rural Catholics, meanwhile,\r\non their side, massacre six Protestants in the environs--an old man\r\nof eighty-two years, a youth of fifteen, and a husband and his wife\r\nin their farm-house. In order to put a stop to the murderous acts, the\r\nNational Guard of Montpellier have to be summoned. But the restoration\r\nof order is for the benefit of the victorious party. Three-fifths of\r\nthe electors have fled; one-third of the district and departmental\r\nadministrators have been appointed in their absence, and the majority of\r\nthe new directories is taken from the club of patriots. It is for this\r\nreason that the prisoners are prejudged as guilty. \"No bailiff of the\r\ncourt dares give them the benefit of his services; they are not allowed\r\nto bring forward justifying facts in evidence, while everybody knows\r\nthat the judges are not impartial.\"[3209]\r\n\r\nThus do the violent measures of political and religious discord come to\r\nan end. The victor stops the mouth of the law when it is about to\r\nspeak in his adversary's behalf; and, under the legal iniquity of an\r\nadministration which he has himself established, he crushes those whom\r\nthe illegal force of his own strong hand has stricken down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--Passion Supreme.\r\n\r\n     Dread of hunger its most acute form.--The non-circulation of\r\n     grain.--Intervention and usurpations of the electoral\r\n     assemblies.--The rural code in Nivernais.--The four central\r\n     provinces in 1790.--Why high prices are kept up.--Anxiety\r\n     and insecurity.--Stagnation of the grain market.--The\r\n     departments near Paris in 1791.--The supply and price of\r\n     grain regulated by force.--The mobs in 1792.--Village armies\r\n     of Eure and of the lower Seine and of Aisne.--Aggravation of\r\n     the disorder after August 10th.--The dictatorship of\r\n     unbridled instinct.--Its practical and political expedients.\r\n\r\n\r\nPassions of this stamp are the product of human cultivation, and break\r\nloose only within narrow bounds. Another passion exists which is neither\r\nhistoric nor local, but natural and universal, the most indomitable,\r\nmost imperious, and most formidable of all, namely, the fear of hunger.\r\nThere is no such thing with this passion as delay, or reflection, or\r\nlooking beyond itself. Each commune or canton wants its bread, and a\r\nsure and unlimited supply of it. Our neighbor may provide for himself as\r\nbest he can, but let us look out for ourselves first and then for other\r\npeople. Each group of people, accordingly, through its own decrees, or\r\nby main force, keeps for itself whatever subsistence it possesses, or\r\ntakes from others the subsistence which it does not possess. ii\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1789,[3210] \"Roussillon refuses aid to Languedoc; Upper\r\nLanguedoc to the rest of the province, and Burgundy to Lyonnais;\r\nDauphiny shuts herself up, and Normandy retains the wheat purchased for\r\nthe relief of Paris.\" At Paris, sentinels are posted at the doors of all\r\nthe bakers; on the 21st of October one of the latter is hung, and his\r\nhead is borne about on a pike. On the 27th of October, at Vernon, a\r\ncorn-merchant named Planter, who the preceding winter had supported the\r\npoor for six leagues around, has to take his turn. At the present moment\r\nthe people do not forgive him for having sent flour to Paris, and he is\r\nhung twice, but is saved through the breaking of the rope each time.--It\r\nis only by force and under an escort that it is possible to insure the\r\narrival of grain in a town; the excited people or the National Guards\r\nconstantly seize it on its passage. In Normandy the militia of\r\nCaen stops wheat on the highways which is destined for Harcourt and\r\nelsewhere.[3211] In Brittany, Auray and Vannes retain the convoys\r\nfor Nantes, and Lannion those for Brest. Brest having attempted to\r\nnegotiate, its commissioners are seized, and, with knives at their\r\nthroats, are forced to sign a renunciation, pure and simple, of the\r\ngrain which they have paid for, and they are led out of Lannion and\r\nstoned on the way. Eighteen hundred men, consequently, leave Brest with\r\nfour cannon, and go to recover their property with their guns loaded.\r\nThese are the customs prevalent during the great famines of feudal\r\ntimes; and, from one end of France to the other, to say nothing of\r\nthe out-breaks of the famished in the large towns, similar outrages or\r\nattempts at recovery are constantly occurring.--\" The armed population\r\nof Nantua, Saint-Claude, and Septmoncel,\" says a dispatch,[3212] \"have\r\nagain cut off provisions from the Gex region; there is no wheat coming\r\nthere from any direction, all the roads being guarded. Without the aid\r\nof the government of Geneva, which is willing to lend to this region\r\neight hundred Cuttings of wheat, we should either die of starvation or\r\nbe compelled to take grain by force from the municipalities which\r\nkeep it to themselves.\" Narbonne starves Toulon; the navigation of the\r\nLanguedoc canal is intercepted; the people on its banks repulse two\r\ncompanies of soldiers, burn a large building, and want to destroy the\r\ncanal itself.\" Boats are stopped, wagons are pillaged, bread is forcibly\r\nlowered in price, stones are thrown and guns discharged; the populace\r\ncontend with the National Guard, peasants with townsmen, purchasers\r\nwith dealers, artisans and laborers with farmers and land-owners, at\r\nCastelnaudary, Niort, Saint-Etienne, in Aisne, in Pas-de-Calais, and\r\nespecially along the line stretching from Montbrison to Angers--that\r\nis to say, for almost the whole of the extent of the vast basin of the\r\nLoire,--such is the spectacle presented by the year 1790.--And yet the\r\ncrop has not been a bad one. But there is no circulation of grain. Each\r\npetty center has formed a league for the monopoly of food; and hence the\r\nfasting of others and the convulsions of the entire body are the\r\nfirst effects of the unbridled freedom which the Constitution and\r\ncircumstances have conferred on each local group.\r\n\r\n\"We are told to assemble, vote, and elect men that will attend to our\r\nbusiness; let us attend to it ourselves. We have had enough of talk and\r\nhypocrisy. Bread at two sous, and let us go after wheat where it can\r\nbe found!\" Such is the reasoning of the peasantry, and, in Nivernais,\r\nBourbonnais, Berri, and Touraine, electoral gatherings are the\r\nfirebrands of the insurrections.[3213] At Saint-Sauge, \"the first work\r\nof the primary meeting is to oblige the municipal officers to fix the\r\nprice of wheat under the penalty of being decapitated.\" At Saint-Géran\r\nthe same course is taken with regard to bread, wheat, and meat; at\r\nChâtillon-en-Bayait it is done with all supplies, and always a third or\r\na half under the market price, without mentioning other exactions.--They\r\ncome by degrees to the drafting of a tariff for all the valuables they\r\nknow, proclaiming the maximum price which an article may reach, and so\r\nestablishing a complete code of rural and social economy. We see in the\r\nturbulent and spasmodic wording of this instrument their dispositions\r\nand sentiments, as in a mirror.[3214] It is the program of villagers.\r\nIts diverse articles, save local variations, must be executed, now one\r\nand now the other, according to the occasion, the need, and the time,\r\nand, above all, whatever concerns provisions.--The wish, as usual, is\r\nthe father of the thought; the peasantry thinks that it is acting by\r\nauthority: here, through a decree of the King and the National Assembly,\r\nthere, by a commission directly entrusted to the Comte d'Estrées. Even\r\nbefore this, in the market-place of Saint-Amand, \"a man jumped on a heap\r\nof wheat and cried out, 'In the name of the King and the nation, wheat\r\nat one-half the market-price!\"' An old officer of the Royal Grenadiers,\r\na chevalier of the order of Saint-Louis, is reported to be marching at\r\nthe head of several parishes, and promulgating ordinances in his own\r\nname and that of the King, imposing a fine of eight livres on whoever\r\nmay refuse to join him.--On all sides there is a swarm of working\r\npeople, and resistance is fruitless. There are too many of them, the\r\nconstabulary being drowned in the flood. For, these rustic legislators\r\nare the National Guard itself, and when they vote reductions upon, or\r\nrequisitions for, supplies, they enforce their demands with their guns.\r\nThe municipal officials, willingly or unwillingly, must needs serve the\r\ninsurgents. At Donjon the Electoral Assembly has seized the mayor of the\r\nplace and threatened to kill him, or to burn his house, if he did not\r\nput the cutting of wheat at forty sous; whereupon he signs, and all the\r\nmayors with him, \"under the penalty of death.\" As soon as this is done\r\nthe peasants, \"to the sound of fifes and drums,\" spread through the\r\nneighboring parishes and force the delivery of wheat at forty sous, and\r\nshow such a determined spirit that the four brigades of gendarmes sent\r\nout against them think it best to retire.--Not content with taking what\r\nthey want, they provide for reserve supplies; wheat is a prisoner. In\r\nNivernais and Bourbonnais, the peasants trace a boundary line over which\r\nno sack of grain of that region must pass; in case of any infraction\r\nof this law the rope and the torch are close at hand for the\r\ndelinquent.--It remains to make sure that this rule is enforced. In\r\nBerri bands of peasants visit the markets to see that their tariff is\r\neverywhere maintained. In vain are they told that they are emptying the\r\nmarkets; \"they reply that they know how to make grain come, that they\r\nwill take it from private hands, and money besides, if necessary.\" In\r\nfact, the granaries and cellars belonging to a large number of persons\r\nare pillaged. Farmers are constrained to put their crops into a common\r\ngranary, and the rich are put to ransom; \"the nobles are compelled to\r\ncontribute, and obliged to give entire domains as donations; cattle are\r\ncarried off; and they want to take the lives of the proprietors,\"\r\nwhile the towns, which defend their storehouses and markets, are\r\nopenly attacked.[3215] Bourbon-Lancy, Bourbon-l'Archambault,\r\nSaint-Pierre-le-Moutier, Montluçon, Saint-Amand, Chateau-Gontier,\r\nDecises, each petty community is an islet assailed by the mounting\r\ntide of rustic insurrection. The militia pass the night under arms;\r\ndetachments of the National Guards of the large towns with regular\r\ntroops come and garrison them. The red flag is continuously raised for\r\neight days at Bourbon-Lancy, and cannon stand loaded and pointed in\r\nthe public square. On the 24th of May an attack is made on\r\nSaint-Pierre-le-Moutier, and fusillades take place all night on\r\nboth sides. On the 2nd of June, Saint-Amand, menaced by twenty-seven\r\nparishes, is saved only by the preparations it makes and by the\r\ngarrison. About the same time Bourbon-Lancy is attacked by twelve\r\nparishes combined, and Chateau-Gontier by the sabotiers of the forests\r\nin the vicinity. A band of from four to five hundred villagers arrests\r\nthe convoys of Saint-Amand, and forces their escorts to capitulate;\r\nanother band entrenches itself in the Chateau de la Fin, and fires\r\nthroughout the day on the regulars and the National Guard.--The large\r\ntowns themselves are not safe. Three or four hundred rustics, led\r\nby their municipal officers, forcibly enter Tours, to compel the\r\nmunicipality to lower the price of corn and diminish the rate of leases.\r\nTwo thousand slate-quarry-men, armed with guns, spits, and forks, force\r\ntheir way into Angers to obtain a reduction on bread, fire upon the\r\nguard, and are charged by the troops and the National Guard; a number\r\nremain dead in the streets, two are hung that very evening, and the red\r\nflag is displayed for eight days. \"The town,\" say the dispatches, \"would\r\nhave been pillaged and burnt had it not been for the Picardy regiment.\"\r\nFortunately, as the crop promises to be a good one, prices fall. As the\r\nElectoral Assemblies are closed, the fermentation subsides; and towards\r\nthe end of the year, like a clear spell in a steady storm, the gleam of\r\na truce appears in the civil war excited by hunger.\r\n\r\nBut the truce does not last long, as it is broken in twenty places\r\nby isolated explosions; and towards the month of July, 1791, the\r\ndisturbances arising from the uncertainty of basic food supplies\r\nbegin again, to cease no more. We will consider but one group in this\r\nuniversal state of disorder--that of the eight or ten departments which\r\nsurround Paris and furnish it with supplies. These districts, Brie and\r\nBeauce, are rich wheat regions, and not only was the crop of 1790 good,\r\nbut that of 1791 is ample. Information is sent to the minister from\r\nLaon[3216] that, in the department of Aisne, \"there is a supply of\r\nwheat for two years. . . that the barns, generally empty by the month\r\nof April, will not be so this season before July,\" and, consequently,\r\n\"subsistence is assured.\" But this does not suffice, for the source of\r\nthe evil is not in a scarcity of wheat. In order that everybody, in a\r\nvast and populous country, where the soil, cultivation, and occupations\r\ndiffer, may eat, it is essential that food should be attainable by the\r\nnon-producers; and for it to reach them freely, without delay, solely by\r\nthe natural operation of supply and demand, it is essential that\r\nthere should be a police able to protect property, transactions, and\r\ntransport. Just in proportion as the authority of a State becomes\r\nweakened, and in proportion as security diminishes, the distribution of\r\nsubsistence becomes more and more difficult: a gendarmerie, therefore,\r\nis an indispensable wheel in the machine by which we are able to secure\r\nour daily bread. Hence it is that, in 1791, daily bread is wanting to a\r\nlarge number of men. Simply through the working of the Constitution, all\r\nrestraints, already slackened both at the extremities and at the center,\r\nare becoming looser and more loose each day. The municipalities, which\r\nare really sovereign, repress the people more feebly, some because the\r\nlatter are the bolder and themselves more timid, and others because they\r\nare more radical and always consider them in the right. The National\r\nGuard is wearied, never comes forward, or refuses to use its arms. The\r\nactive citizens are disgusted, and remain at home. At Étampes,[3217]\r\nwhere they are convoked by the commissioners of the department to take\r\nsteps to re-establish some kind of order, only twenty assemble; the\r\nothers excuse themselves by saying that, if the populace knew that they\r\nopposed its will, \"their houses would be burnt,\" and they accordingly\r\nstay away. \"Thus,\" write the commissioners, \"the common-weal is given\r\nup to artisans and laborers whose views are limited to their own\r\nexistence.\"--It is, accordingly, the lower class which rules, and the\r\ninformation upon which it bases its decrees consists of rumors which it\r\naccepts or manufactures, to hide by an appearance of right the outrages\r\nwhich are due to its cupidity or to the brutalities of its hunger. At\r\nÉtampes, \"they have been made to believe that the grain which had\r\nbeen sold for supplying the departments below the Loire, is shipped at\r\nPaimboeuf and taken out of the kingdom from there to be sold abroad.\" In\r\nthe suburbs of Rouen they imagine that grain is purposely \"engulfed\r\nin the swamps, ponds, and clay-pits.\" At Laon, imbecile and Jacobin\r\ncommittees attribute the dearness of provisions to the avidity of the\r\nrich and the malevolence of the aristocrats according to them, \"jealous\r\nmillionaires grow rich at the expense of the people. They know the\r\npopular strength,\" and, not daring to measure their forces with it, \"in\r\nan honorable fight,\" have recourse \"to treachery.\" To conquer the\r\npeople easily they have determined to reduce them in advance by extreme\r\nsuffering and by the length of their fast, and hence they monopolize\r\n\"wheat, rye, and meal, soap, sugar, and brandy.\"[3218]--Similar reports\r\nsuffice to excite a suffering crowd to acts of violence, and it must\r\ninevitably accept for its leaders and advisers those who urge it forward\r\non the side to which it is inclined. The people always require leaders,\r\nand they are chosen wherever they can be found, at one time amongst the\r\nelite, and at another amongst the dregs. Now that the nobles are\r\ndriven out, the bourgeoisie in retirement, the large cultivators\r\nunder suspicion, while animal necessities exercise their blind and\r\nintermittent despotism, the appropriate popular ministers consist of\r\nadventurers and of bandits. They need not be very numerous, for in a\r\nplace full of combustible matter a few firebrands suffice to start the\r\nconflagration. \"About twenty, at most, can be counted in the towns of\r\nÉtampes and Dourdan, men with nothing to lose and everything to gain by\r\ndisturbances; they are those who always produce excitement and disorder,\r\nwhile other citizens afford them the means through their indifference.\"\r\nThose whose names are known among the new guides of the crowd are almost\r\nall escaped convicts whose previous habits have accustomed them to\r\nblows, violence, frequently to murder, and always to contempt for the\r\nlaw. At Brunoy,[3219] the leaders of the outbreak are \"two deserters of\r\nthe 18th regiment, sentenced and unpunished, who, in company with the\r\nvilest and most desperate of the parish, always go about armed and\r\nthreatening.\" At Étampes, \"the two principal assassins of the mayor\r\nare a poacher repeatedly condemned for poaching, and an old carabiniere\r\ndismissed from his regiment with a bad record against him.\"[3220] Around\r\nthese are artisans \"without a known residence,\" wandering workmen,\r\njourneymen and apprentices, vagrants and highway rovers, who flock into\r\nthe towns on market-days and are always--ready for mischief when an\r\nopportunity occurs. Vagabonds, indeed, now roam about the country\r\neverywhere, all restrictions against them having ceased.\r\n\r\n\"For a year past,\" write several parishes in the neighborhood of\r\nVersailles, \"we have seen no gendarmes except those who come with\r\ndecrees,\" and hence the multiplication of \"murders and brigandage\"\r\nbetween Étampes and Versailles, on the highways and in the country.\r\nBands of thirteen, fifteen, twenty and twenty-two beggars rob the\r\nvineyards, enter farm-houses at night, and compel their inmates to lodge\r\nand feed them, returning in the same way every fortnight, all farms or\r\nisolated dwellings being their prey. An ecclesiastic is killed in his\r\nown house in the suburbs of Versailles, on the 26th of September, 1791,\r\nand, on the same day, a bourgeois and his wife are garroted and robbed.\r\nOn the 22nd of September, near Saint-Rémi-Honoré, eight bandits ransack\r\nthe dwelling of a farmer. On the 25th of September, at Villers-le-Sec,\r\nthirteen others strip another farmer, and then add with much politeness,\r\n\"It is lucky for your masters that they are not here, for we would have\r\nroasted them at yonder fire.\" Six similar outrages are committed by\r\narmed ruffians in dwelling-places, within a radius of from three to four\r\nleagues, accompanied with the threats of the chauffeurs.[3221] \"After\r\nenterprises of such force and boldness,\" write the people of this\r\nregion, \"there is not a well-to-do man in the country who can rely upon\r\nan hour's security in his house. Already many of our best cultivators\r\nare giving up their business, while others threaten to do the same in\r\ncase these disorders continue.\"--What is worse still is the fact that in\r\nthese outrages most of the bandits were \"in the national uniform.\" The\r\nmost ignorant, the poorest, and most fanatical of the National Guard\r\nthus enlist for the sake of plunder. It is so natural for men to believe\r\nin their right to that of which they feel the need, that the possessors\r\nof wheat thus become its monopolists, and the superfluity of the rich\r\nthe property of the poor! This is what the peasants say who devastate\r\nthe forest of Bruyères-le-Chatel: \"We have neither wood, bread, nor\r\nwork--necessity knows no law.\"\r\n\r\nThe necessaries of life are not to be had cheap under such a system.\r\nThere is too much anxiety, and property is too precarious; there are too\r\nmany obstacles to commerce; purchases, sales, shipments, arrivals and\r\npayments are too uncertain. How are goods to be stored and transported\r\nin a country where neither the central government, the local\r\nauthorities, the National Guard, nor the regular troops perform their\r\nduties, and where every transaction in produce, even the most legal and\r\nthe most serviceable, is subject to the caprice of a dozen villains whom\r\nthe populace obey.--Wheat remains in the barn, or is secreted, or is\r\nkept waiting, and only reaches by stealth the hands of those who are\r\nrich enough to pay, not only its price, but the extra cost of the\r\nrisk. Thus forced into a narrow channel, it rises to a rate which the\r\ndepreciation of the assignats augments, its dearness being not only\r\nmaintained, but ever on the increase.--Thereupon popular instinct\r\ninvents for the cure of the evil a remedy which serves to aggravate\r\nit: henceforth, wheat must not travel; it is impounded in the canton in\r\nwhich it is gathered. At Laon, \"the people have sworn to die rather than\r\nlet their food be carried off.\" At Étampes, to which the municipality\r\nof Angers dispatches an administrator of its hospital to buy two\r\nhundred and fifty sacks of flour, the commission cannot be executed,\r\nthe delegate not even daring to avow for several days the object of\r\nhis coming; all he can do is \"to visit incognito, and at night, the\r\ndifferent flour-dealers in the valley, who would offer to furnish\r\nthe supply, but fear for their lives and dare not even leave their\r\nhouses.\"--The same violence is shown in the more distant circle of\r\ndepartments which surround the first circle. At Aubigny, in Cher,[3222]\r\ngrain-wagons are stopped, the district administrators are menaced; two\r\nhave a price set on their heads; a portion of the National Guard sides\r\nwith the mutineers. At Chaumont, in Haute-Marne, the whole of the\r\nNational Guard is in a state of mutiny; a convoy of over three hundred\r\nsacks is stopped, the Hôtel-de-Ville forced, and the insurrection lasts\r\nfour days; the directory of the department takes flight; and the people\r\nseize on the powder and cannons. At Douai, in the \"Nord,\" to save\r\na grain-dealer, he is put in prison; the mob forces the gates, the\r\nsoldiers refuse to fire, and the man is hung, while the directory of\r\nthe department takes refuge in Lille. At Montreuil-sur-Mer, in\r\nPas-de-Calais, the two leaders of the insurrection, a brazier and a\r\nhorse-shoer, \"Bèquelin, called Petit-Gueux,\" the latter with his saber\r\nin hand, reply to the summons of the municipal authorities, that \"not a\r\ngrain shall go now that they are masters,\" and that if they dare to make\r\nsuch proclamations \"they will cut off their heads.\" There are no\r\nmeans of resistance. The National Guard, when it is convoked, does not\r\nrespond; the volunteers when called upon turn their muskets down, and\r\nthe crowd, assembled beneath the windows, shouts out its huzzahs. So\r\nmuch the worse for the law when it opposes popular passion: \"We will not\r\nobey it,\" they say; \"people make laws to please themselves.\"--By way\r\nof practical illustration, at Tortes, in Seine-Inférieure, six thousand\r\narmed men belonging to the surrounding parishes form a deliberative\r\narmed body; the better to establish their rights, they bring two cannon\r\nwith them fastened by ropes on a couple of carts; twenty-two companies\r\nof the National Guard, each under its own banner, march beside them,\r\nwhile all peaceable inhabitants are compelled to fall in \"under penalty\r\nof death,\" the municipal officers being at their head. This improvised\r\nparliament promulgates a complete law in relation to grain, which, as\r\na matter of form, is sent for acceptance to the department, and to the\r\nNational Assembly; and one of its articles declares that all husbandmen\r\nshall be forbidden \"to sell their wheat elsewhere than on the\r\nmarket-places.\" With no other outlet for it, wheat must be brought\r\nto the corn markets (halles), and when these are full the price must\r\nnecessarily fall.\r\n\r\nWhat a profound deception! Even in the granary of France wheat remains\r\ndear, and costs about one-third more than would be necessary to secure\r\nthe sale of bread at two sous the pound, in conformity with the will of\r\nthe people. For instance,[3223] at Gonesse, Dourdan, Corbeil, Mennecy,\r\nBrunoy, Limours, Brie-Comte-Robert, and especially at Étampes and\r\nMontlhéry, the holders of grain are compelled almost weekly, through the\r\nclamors and violence of the people, to reduce prices one-third and\r\nmore. It is impossible for the authorities to maintain, on their\r\ncorn-exchange, the freedom of buying and selling. The regular troops\r\nhave been sent off by the people beforehand. Whatever the tolerance or\r\nconnivance of the soldiers may be, the people have a vague sentiment\r\nthat they are not there to permit the ripping open of sacks of flour, or\r\nthe seizing of farmers by the throat. To get rid of all obstacles and of\r\nbeing watched, they make use of the municipality itself, and force it\r\nto effect its own disarmament. The municipal officers, besieged in the\r\ntown-hall, at times threatened with pistols and bayonets,[3224] dispatch\r\nto the detachments they are expecting an order to turn back, and entreat\r\nthe Directory not to send any more troops, for, if any come, they have\r\nbeen told that \"they will be sorry for it.\" Nowhere are there regular\r\ntroops. At Étampes, the people repeat that \"they are sent for and paid\r\nby the flour-dealers;\" at Montlhéry, that \"they merely serve to arm\r\ncitizens against each other;\" at Limours, that \"they make grain dearer.\"\r\nAll pretexts seem good in this direction; the popular will is absolute,\r\nand the authorities complacently meet its decrees half-way. At\r\nMontlhéry, the municipal body orders the gendarmerie to remain at the\r\ngates of the town, which gives full play to the insurrection.--The\r\nadministrators, however, are not relieved by leaving the people free to\r\nact; they are obliged to sanction their exactions by ordinances. They\r\nare taken out of the Hôtel-de-Ville, led to the marketplace, and there\r\nforthwith, under the dictation of the uproar which establishes prices,\r\nthey, like simple clerks, proclaim the reduction. When, moreover, the\r\narmed rabble of a village marches forth to tyrannize over a neighboring\r\nmarket, it carries its mayor along with it in spite of himself, as an\r\nofficial instrument which belongs to it.[3225] \"There is no resistance\r\nagainst force,\" writes the mayor of Vert-le-Petit; \"we had to set forth\r\nimmediately.\"--\" They assured me,\" says the Mayor of Fontenay, \"that,\r\nif I did not obey them, they would hang me.\"--On any municipal officer\r\nhazarding a remonstrance, they tell him that \"he is getting to be an\r\naristocrat.\" Aristocrat and hung, the argument is irresistible, and\r\nall the more so because it is actually applied. At Corbeil, the\r\nprocureur-syndic who tries to enforce the law is almost beaten to\r\ndeath, and three houses in which they try to find him are demolished. At\r\nMontlhéry, a seed merchant, accused of mixing the flour of beans (twice\r\nas dear) with wheaten flour, is massacred in his own house. At Étampes,\r\nthe mayor who promulgates the law is cudgeled to death. Mobs talk of\r\nnothing but \"burning and destroying,\" while the farmers, abused,\r\nhooted at, forced to sell, threatened with death and robbed, run away,\r\ndeclaring they will never return to the market again.\r\n\r\nSuch is the first effect of popular dictatorship. Like all unintelligent\r\nforces, it operates in a direction the reverse of its intention: to\r\ndearness it adds dearth, and empties, instead of replenishing, the\r\nmarkets. That of Étampes often contained fifteen or sixteen hundred\r\nsacks of flour; the week following this insurrection there were, at\r\nmost, sixty brought to it. At Montlhéry, where six thousand men had\r\ncollected together, each one obtains for his share only a small measure,\r\nwhile the bakers of the town have none at all. This being the case, the\r\nenraged National Guards tell the farmers that they are coming to see\r\nthem on their farms. And they really go.[3226] Drums roll constantly\r\non the roads around Montlhéry, Limours, and other large market-towns.\r\nColumns of two, three, and four hundred men are seen passing under the\r\nlead of their commandant and of the mayor whom they take along with\r\nthem. They enter each farm, mount into the granaries, estimate the\r\nquantity of grain thrashed out, and force the proprietor to sign an\r\nagreement to bring it to market the following week. Sometimes, as they\r\nare hungry, they compel people to give them something to eat and drink\r\non the spot, and it will not do to enrage them,--a farmer and his wife\r\ncome near being hung in their own barn.\r\n\r\nTheir effort is useless: Wheat is impounded and hunted up in vain; it\r\ntakes to the earth or slips off like a frightened animal. In vain do\r\ninsurrections continue. In vain do armed mobs, in all the market-towns\r\nof the department,[3227] subject grain to a forced reduction of price.\r\nWheat becomes scarcer and dearer from month to month, rising in price\r\nfrom twenty-six francs to thirty-three. And because the outraged farmer\r\n\"brings now a very little,\" just \"what is necessary to sacrifice\r\nin order to avoid threats, he sells at home, or in the inns, to the\r\nflour-dealers from Paris.\"--The people, in running after abundance, have\r\nthus fallen deeper down into want: their brutality has aggravated their\r\nmisery, and it is to themselves that their starvation is owing. But\r\nthey are far from attributing all this to their own insubordination;\r\nthe magistrates are accused; these, in the eyes of the populace, are \"in\r\nleague with the monopolists.\" On this incline no stoppage is possible.\r\nDistress increases rage, and rage increases distress; and on this fatal\r\ndeclivity men are precipitated from one outrage to another.\r\n\r\nAfter the month of February, 1792, such outrages are innumerable; the\r\nmobs which go in quest of grain or which cut down its price consist\r\nof armies. One of six thousand men comes to control the market of\r\nMontlhéry.[3228] There are seven to eight--thousand men who invade the\r\nmarket-place of Verneuil, and there is an army of ten and another of\r\ntwenty-five thousand men, who remain organized for ten days near\r\nLaon. One hundred and fifty parishes have sounded the tocsin, and the\r\ninsurrection spreads for ten leagues around. Five boats loaded with\r\ngrain are stopped, and, in spite of the orders of district, department,\r\nminister, King, and National Assembly, they refuse to surrender them.\r\nTheir contents, in the meantime, are made the most of: \"The municipal\r\nofficers of the different parishes, assembled together, pay themselves\r\ntheir fees, to wit: one hundred sous per diem for the mayor, three\r\nlivres for the municipal officers, two livres ten sous for the guards,\r\ntwo livres for the porters. They have ordered that these sums should\r\nbe paid in grain, and they reduce grain, it is said, fifteen livres the\r\nsack. It is certain that they have divided it amongst themselves, and\r\nthat fourteen hundred sacks have been distributed.\" In vain do the\r\ncommissioners of the National Assembly make speeches to them three hours\r\nin length. The discourse being finished, they deliberate, in presence of\r\nthe commissioners, whether the latter shall be hung, drowned, or cut\r\nup, and their heads put on the five points of the middle of the abbey\r\nrailing. On being threatened with military force, they make their\r\ndispositions accordingly. Nine hundred men who relieve each other watch\r\nday and night on the ground, in a well chosen and permanent encampment,\r\nwhile lookouts stationed in the belfries of the surrounding villages\r\nhave only to sound the alarm to bring together twenty-five thousand\r\nmen in a few hours.--So long as the Government remains on its feet it\r\ncarries on the combat as well as it can; but it grows weaker from month\r\nto month, and, after the 10th of August, when it lies on the ground, the\r\nmob takes its place and becomes the universal sovereign. From this time\r\nforth not only is the law which protects provisioning powerless against\r\nthe disturbers of sale and circulation, but the Assembly actually\r\nsanctions their acts, since it decrees[3229] the stoppage of all\r\nproceedings commenced against them, remits sentences already passed,\r\nand sets free all who are imprisoned or in irons. Behold every\r\nadministration, with merchants, proprietors, and farmers abandoned to\r\nthe famished, the furious, and to robbers; henceforth food supplies are\r\nfor those who are disposed and able to take them.\r\n\r\n\"You will be told,\" says a petition,[3230] \"that we violate the law. We\r\nreply to these perfidious insinuations that the salvation of the people\r\nis the supreme law. We come in order to keep the markets supplied, and\r\nto insure an uniform price for wheat throughout the Republic. For, there\r\nis no doubt about it, the purest patriotism dies out (sic) when there is\r\nno bread to be had. . . . Resistance to oppression--yes, resistance to\r\noppression is the most sacred of duties; is there any oppression more\r\nterrible than that of wanting bread? Undoubtedly, no. . . . Join us\r\nand 'Ça ira, ça ira!' We cannot end our petition better than with this\r\npatriotic air.\"\r\n\r\nThis supplication was written on a drum, amidst a circle of firearms;\r\nand with such accompaniments it is equivalent to a command.--They are\r\nwell aware of it, and of their own authority they often confer\r\nupon themselves not only the right but also the title. In\r\nLoire-et-Cher,[3231] a band of from four to five thousand men assume the\r\nname of \"Sovereign Power.\" They go from one market-town to another,\r\nto Saint-Calais, Montdoubleau, Blois, Vendôme, reducing the cost of\r\nprovisions, their troop increasing like a snowball--for they threaten\r\n\"to burn the effects and set fire to the houses of all who are not as\r\ncourageous as themselves.\"\r\n\r\nIn this state of social disintegration, insurrection is a gangrene in\r\nwhich the healthy are infected by the morbid parts. Mobs are everywhere\r\nproduced and re-produced, incessantly, large and small, like abscesses\r\nwhich break out side by side, and painfully irritate each other and\r\nfinally combine. There are the towns against the rural districts and\r\nrural districts against the towns. On the one hand \"every farmer\r\nwho transports anything to the market passes (at home) for an\r\naristocrat,[3232] and becomes the horror of his fellow-citizens in the\r\nvillage.\" On the other hand the National Guards of the towns spread\r\nthemselves through the rural districts and make raids to save themselves\r\nfrom death by hunger.[3233] It is admitted in the rural districts that\r\neach municipality has the right to isolate itself from the rest. It\r\nis admitted in the towns that each town has the right to derive its\r\nprovisions from the country. It is admitted by the indigent of each\r\ncommune that the commune must provide bread gratis or at a cheap rate.\r\nOn the strength of this there is a shower of stones and a fusillade;\r\ndepartment against department, district against district, canton against\r\ncanton, all fight for food, and the strongest get it and keep it for\r\nthemselves.--I have simply described the North, where, for the past\r\nthree years, the crops are good. I have omitted the South, where trade\r\nis interrupted on the canal of the Deux Mers, where the procureur-syndic\r\nof Aude has lately been massacred for trying to secure the passage of\r\na convoy; where the harvest has been poor; where, in many places, bread\r\ncosts eight sous the pound; where, in almost every department, a bushel\r\nof wheat is sold twice as dear as in the North!\r\n\r\nStrange phenomenon! and the most instructive of all, for in it we see\r\ndown into the depths of humanity; for, as on a raft of shipwrecked\r\nbeings without food, there is a reversion to a state of nature. The\r\nlight tissue of habit and of rational ideas in which civilization has\r\nenveloped man, is torn asunder and is floating in rags around him; the\r\nbare arms of the savage show themselves, and they are striking out.\r\nThe only guide he has for his conduct is that of primitive days, the\r\nstartled instinct of a craving stomach. Henceforth that which rules in\r\nhim and through him is animal necessity with its train of violent\r\nand narrow suggestions, sometimes sanguinary and sometimes grotesque.\r\nIncompetent or savage, in all respects like a Negro monarch, his sole\r\npolitical expedients are either the methods of a slaughter house or the\r\ndreams of a carnival. Two commissioners whom Roland, Minister of the\r\nInterior, sends to Lyons, are able to see within a few days the carnival\r\nand the slaughter-house.[3234]--On the one hand the peasants, all along\r\nthe road, arrest everybody; the people regard every traveler as an\r\naristocrat who is running away--which is so much the worse for those who\r\nfall into their hands. Near Autun, four priests who, to obey the law,\r\nare betaking themselves to the frontier, are put in prison \"for their\r\nown protection;\" they are taken out a quarter of an hour later, and,\r\nin spite of thirty-two of the mounted police, are massacred. \"Their\r\ncarriage was still burning as I passed, and the corpses were stretched\r\nout not far off. Their driver was still in durance, and it was it vain\r\nthat I solicited his release.\"--On the other hand, at Lyons, the power\r\nhas fallen into the hands of the degraded women of the streets. \"They\r\nseized the central club, constituted themselves commissaries of police,\r\nsigned notices as such, and paid visits of inspection to store-houses;\"\r\nthey drew up a tariff of provisions, \"from bread and meat up to common\r\npeaches, and peaches of fine quality.\" They announced that \"whoever\r\ndared to dispute it would be considered a traitor to the country,\r\nan adherent of the civil list, and prosecuted as such.\" All this is\r\npublished, proclaimed and applied by \"female commissaries of police,\"\r\nthemselves the dregs of the lowest sinks of corruption. Respectable\r\nhousewives and workwomen had nothing to do with it, nor \"working-people\r\nof any class.\" The sole actors of this administrative parody are\r\n\"scamps, a few bullies of houses of ill-fame, and a portion of the dregs\r\nof the female sex.\"--To this end comes the dictatorship of instinct,\r\nyonder let loose on the highway in a massacre of priests, and here, in\r\nthe second city of France, in the government of strumpets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--Egotism of the tax-payer.\r\n\r\n     Issoudun in 1790.--Rebellion against taxation.--Indirect\r\n     taxes in 1789 and 1790.--Abolition of the salt tax, excise,\r\n     and octrois.--Direct taxation in 1789 and 1790.--Delay and\r\n     insufficiency of the returns.--New levies in 1791 and 1792.\r\n     --Delays, partiality, and concealment in preparing the\r\n     rolls.--Insufficiency of, and the delay in, the returns.\r\n     --Payment in assignats.--The tax-payer relieves himself of\r\n     one-half.--Devastation of the forests.--Division of the\r\n     communal property.\r\n\r\nThe fear of starvation is only the sharper form of a more general\r\npassion, which is the desire of possession and the determination not\r\nto give anything up. No popular instinct, had been longer, more rudely,\r\nmore universally offended under the ancient régime; and there is none\r\nwhich gushes out more readily under constraint, none which requires a\r\nhigher or broader public barrier, or one more entirely constructed of\r\nsolid blocks, to keep it in check. Hence it is that this passion from\r\nthe commencement breaks down or engulfs the slight and low boundaries,\r\nthe tottering embankments of crumbling earth between which the\r\nConstitution pretends to confine it.--The first flood sweeps away the\r\npecuniary claims of the State, of the clergy, and of the noblesse. The\r\npeople regard them as abolished, or, at least, they consider their debts\r\ndischarged. Their idea, in relation to this, is formed and fixed; for\r\nthem it is that which constitutes the Revolution. The people have no\r\nlonger a creditor; they are determined to have none, they will pay\r\nnobody, and first of all, they will make no further payment to the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of July, 1790, the day of the Federation, the population of\r\nIssoudun, in Touraine, solemnly convoked for the purpose, had just taken\r\nthe solemn oath which was to ensure public peace, social harmony, and\r\nrespect for the law for evermore.[3235] Here, probably, as elsewhere,\r\narrangements had been made for an stirring ceremonial; there were young\r\ngirls dressed in white, and learned and impressionable magistrates were\r\nto pronounce philosophical harangues. All at once they discover that the\r\npeople gathered on the public square are provided with clubs, scythes,\r\nand axes, and that the National Guard will not prevent their use; on the\r\ncontrary, the Guard itself is composed almost wholly of wine growers and\r\nothers interested in the suppression of the duties on wine, of coopers,\r\ninnkeepers, workmen, carters of casks, and others of the same stamp,\r\nall rough fellows who have their own way of interpreting the Social\r\nContract. The whole mass of decrees, acts, and rhetorical flourishes\r\nwhich are dispatched to them from Paris, or which emanate from the new\r\nauthorities, are not worth a halfpenny tax maintained on each bottle\r\nof wine. There are to be no more excise duties; they will only take the\r\ncivic oath on this express condition, and that very evening they hang,\r\nin effigy, their two deputies, who \"had not supported their interests\"\r\nin the National Assembly. A few months later, of all the National Guard\r\ncalled upon to protect the clerks, only the commandant and two officers\r\nrespond to the summons. If a docile taxpayer happens to be found, he\r\nis not allowed to pay the dues; this seems a defection and almost\r\ntreachery. An entry of three puncheons of wine having been made, they\r\nare stove in with stones, a portion is drunk, and the rest taken to the\r\nbarracks to debauch the soldiers; M. de Sauzay, commandant of the \"Royal\r\nRoussillon,\" who was bold enough to save the clerks, is menaced, and for\r\nthis misdeed he barely escapes being hung himself. When the municipal\r\nbody is called upon to interpose and employ force, it replies that \"for\r\nso small a matter, it is not worth while to compromise the lives of the\r\ncitizens,\" and the regular troops sent to the Hôtel-de-Ville are ordered\r\nby the people not to go except with the but-ends of their muskets in the\r\nair. Five days after this the windows of the excise office are smashed,\r\nand the public notices are torn down; the fermentation does not subside,\r\nand M. de Sauzay writes that a regiment would be necessary to restrain\r\nthe town. At Saint-Amand the insurrection breaks out violently, and is\r\nonly put down by violence. At Saint-Étienne-en-Forez, Bertheas, a clerk\r\nin the excise office, falsely accused of monopolizing grain,[3236]\r\nis fruitlessly defended by the National Guard; he is put in prison,\r\naccording to the usual custom, to save his life, and, for greater\r\nsecurity, the crowd insist on his being fastened by an iron collar.\r\nBut, suddenly changing its mind, it breaks upon the door and drags him\r\noutside, beating him till he is unconscious. Stretched on the ground,\r\nhis head still moves and he raises his hand to it, when a woman,\r\npicking up a large stone, smashes his skull.--These are not isolated\r\noccurrences. During the months of July and August, 1789, the tax offices\r\nare burnt in almost every town in the kingdom. In vain does the National\r\nAssembly order their reconstruction, insist on the maintenance of duties\r\nand octrois, and explain to the people the public needs, pathetically\r\nreminding them, moreover, that the Assembly has already given them\r\nrelief;--the people prefer to relieve themselves instantly and entirely.\r\nWhatever is consumed must no longer be taxed, either for the benefit of\r\nthe State or for that of the towns. \"Entrance dues on wine and cattle,\"\r\nwrites the municipality of Saint-Etienne, \"scarcely amount to anything,\r\nand our powers are inadequate for their enforcement.\" At Cambrai, two\r\nsuccessive outbreaks compel the excise office and the magistracy of\r\nthe town[3237] to reduce the duties on beer one-half. But \"the evil, at\r\nfirst confined to one corner of the province, soon spreads;\" the grands\r\nbaillis of Lille, Douai, and Orchies write that \"we have hardly a bureau\r\nwhich has not been molested, and in which the taxes are not wholly\r\nsubject to popular discretion.\" Those only pay who are disposed to do\r\nso, and, consequently, \"greater fraud could not exist.\" The taxpayers,\r\nindeed, cunningly defend themselves, and find plenty of arguments or\r\nquibbles to avoid paying their dues. At Cambrai they allege that, as\r\nthe privileged now pay as well as the rest, the Treasury must be\r\nrich enough.[3238] At Noyon, Ham, and Chauny, and in the surrounding\r\nparishes, the butchers, innkeepers, and publicans combined, who have\r\nrefused to pay excise duties, pick flaws in the special decree by which\r\nthe Assembly subjects them to the law, and a second special decree is\r\nnecessary to circumvent these new legal experts. The process at Lyons\r\nis simpler. Here the thirty-two sections appoint commissioners; these\r\ndecide against the octroi, and request the municipal authorities to\r\nabolish it. They must necessarily comply, for the people are at hand and\r\nare furious. Without waiting, however, for any legal measures, they take\r\nthe authority on themselves, rush to the toll-houses and drive out the\r\nclerks, while large quantities of provisions, which \"through a singular\r\npredestination\" were waiting at the gates, come in free of duty.--The\r\nTreasury defends itself as it best can against this universally bad\r\ndisposition of the tax-payer, against these irruptions and infiltrations\r\nof fraud; it repairs the dike where it has been carried away, stops up\r\nthe fissures and again resumes collections. But how can these be regular\r\nand complete in a State where the courts dare not condemn delinquents,\r\nwhere public force dares not support the courts,[3239] where popular\r\nfavor protects the most notorious bandits and the worst vagabonds\r\nagainst the tribunals and against the public powers? At Paris, where,\r\nAfter eight months of impunity, proceedings are begun against the\r\npillagers who, on the 13th of August, 1789, set fire to the tax offices,\r\nthe officers of the election, \"considering that their audiences\r\nhave become too tumultuous, that the thronging of the people excites\r\nuneasiness, that threats have been uttered of a kind calculated to\r\ncreate reasonable alarm,\" are constrained to suspend their sittings and\r\nrefer matters to the National Assembly, while the latter, considering\r\nthat \"if prosecutions are authorized in Paris it will be necessary to\r\nauthorize them throughout the kingdom,\" decides that it is best \"to veil\r\nthe statue of the Law.\"[3240]\r\n\r\nNot only does the Assembly veil the statue of the Law, but it takes to\r\npieces, remakes, and mutilates it, according to the requirements of the\r\npopular will; and, in the matter of indirect imposts all its decrees are\r\nforced upon it. The outbreak against the salt impost was terrible from\r\nthe beginning; sixty thousand men in Anjou alone combined to destroy it,\r\nand the price of salt had to be reduced from sixteen to six sous.[3241]\r\nThe people, however, are not satisfied with this. This monopoly has been\r\nthe cause of so much suffering that they are not disposed to put up with\r\nany remains of it, and are always on the side of the smugglers against\r\nthe excise officers. In the month of January, 1790, at Béziers,\r\nthirty-two employees, who had seized a quantity of contraband salt on\r\nthe persons of armed smugglers,[3242] are pursued by the crowd to the\r\nHôtel-de-Ville; the consuls decline to defend them and run away; the\r\ntroops defend them, but in vain. Five are tortured, horribly mutilated,\r\nand then hung. In the month of March, 1790, Necker states that,\r\naccording to the returns of the past three months, the deficit in\r\nthe salt-tax amounts to more than four millions a month, which is\r\nfour-fifths of the ordinary revenue, while the tobacco monopoly is no\r\nmore respected than that of salt. At Tours,[3243] the bourgeois\r\nmilitia refuse to give assistance to the employees, and \"openly protect\r\nsmuggling,\" \"and contraband tobacco is publicly sold at the fair, under\r\nthe eyes of the municipal authorities, who dare make no Opposition to\r\nit.\" All receipts, consequently, diminish at the same time.[3244] From\r\nthe 1st of May, 1789, to the 1st of May, 1790, the general collections\r\namount to 127 millions instead of 150 millions; the dues and excise\r\ncombined return only 31, instead of 50 millions. The streams which\r\nfilled the public exchequer are more and more obstructed by popular\r\nresistance, and under the popular pressure, the Assembly ends by closing\r\nthem entirely. In the month of March, 1790,[3245] it abolishes salt\r\nduties, internal customs-duties, taxes on leather, on oil, on starch,\r\nand the stamp of iron. In February and March, 1791, it abolishes octrois\r\nand entrance-dues in all the cities and boroughs of the kingdom, all the\r\nexcise duties and those connected with the excise, especially all taxes\r\nwhich affect the manufacture, sale, or circulation of beverages. The\r\npeople have in the end prevailed, and on the 1st of May, 1791, the day\r\nof the application of the decree, the National Guard of Paris parades\r\naround the walls playing patriotic airs. The cannon of the Invalides and\r\nthose on the Pont-Neuf thunder out as if for an important victory.\r\nThere is an illumination in the evening, there is drinking all night, a\r\nuniversal revel. Beer, indeed, is to be had at three sous the pot, and\r\nwine at six sous a pint, which is a reduction of one-half; no conquest\r\ncould be more popular, since it brings intoxication within easy reach of\r\nthe thirsty.[3246]\r\n\r\nThe object, now, is to provide for the expenses which have been defrayed\r\nby the suppressed octrois. In 1790, the octroi of Paris had produced\r\n35,910,859 francs, of which 25,059,446 went to the State, and 10,851,413\r\nwent to the city. How is the city going to pay for its watch, the\r\nlighting and cleaning of its streets, and the support of its hospitals?\r\nWhat are the twelve hundred other cities and boroughs going to do which\r\nare brought by the same stroke to the same situation? What will\r\nthe State do, which, in abolishing the general revenue from all\r\nentrance-dues and excise, is suddenly deprived of two-fifths of its\r\nrevenue?--In the month of March, 1790, when the Assembly suppressed the\r\nsalt and other duties, it established in the place of these a tax of\r\nfifty millions, to be divided between the direct imposts and dues on\r\nentrance to the towns. Now, consequently, that the entrance-dues are\r\nabolished, the new charge falls entirely upon the direct imposts.\r\nDo returns come in, and will they come in?--In the face of so many\r\noutbreaks, any indirect taxation (VAT) is, certainly, difficult to\r\ncollect. Nevertheless it is not so repulsive as the other because the\r\nlevies of the State disappear in the price of the article, the hand of\r\nthe Exchequer being hidden by the hand of the dealer. The Government\r\nclerk formerly presented himself with his stamped paper and the seller\r\nhanded him the money without much grumbling, knowing that he would\r\nsoon be more than reimbursed by his customer: the indirect tax is thus\r\ncollected. Should any difficulty arise, it is between the dealer and the\r\ntaxpayer who comes to his shop to lay in his little store; the latter\r\ngrumbles, but it is at the high price which he feels, and possibly at\r\nthe seller who pockets his silver; he does not find fault with the clerk\r\nof the Exchequer, whom he does not see and who is not then present\r\nIn the collection of the direct tax, on the contrary, it is the clerk\r\nhimself whom he sees before him, who abstracts the precious piece of\r\nsilver. This authorized robber, moreover, gives him nothing in exchange;\r\nit is an entire loss. On leaving the dealer's shop he goes away with a\r\njug of wine, a pot of salt, or similar commodities; on leaving the tax\r\noffice he has nothing in hand but an acquittance, a miserable bit of\r\nscribbled paper.--But now he is master in his own commune, an elector, a\r\nNational Guard, mayor, the sole authority in the use of armed force, and\r\ncharged with his own taxation. Come and ask him to unearth the buried\r\nmite on which he has set all his heart and all his soul, the earthen pot\r\nwherein he has deposited his cherished pieces of silver one by one, and\r\nwhich he has laid by for so many years at the cost of so much misery and\r\nfasting, in the very face of the bailiff in spite of the prosecutions of\r\nthe sub-delegate, commissioner, collector, and clerk!\r\n\r\nFrom the 1st of May, 1789, to the 1st of May, 1790,[3247] the general\r\nreturns, the taille and its accessories, the poll-tax and \"twentieths,\"\r\ninstead of yielding 161.000,000 francs, yield but 28,000,000 francs in\r\nthe provinces which impose their own taxes (pays d'Etats); instead of\r\n28,000,000 francs, the Treasury obtains but 6,000,000. On the patriotic\r\ncontribution which was to deduct one quarter of all incomes over four\r\nhundred livres, and to levy two and a half per cent. on plate, jewels,\r\nand whatever gold and silver each person has in reserve, the State\r\nreceived 9.700,000 francs. As to patriotic gifts, their total,\r\ncomprising the silver buckles of the deputies, reaches only 361,587\r\nfrancs; and the closer our examination into the particulars of these\r\nfigures, the more do we see the contributions of the villager, artisan,\r\nand former subjects of the taille diminish.--Since the month of October,\r\n1789, the privileged classes, in fact, appear in the tax-rolls, and they\r\ncertainly form the class which is best off, the most alive to general\r\nideas and the most truly patriotic. It is therefore probable that, of\r\nthe forty-three millions of returns from the direct imposts and from the\r\npatriotic contribution, they have furnished the larger portion, perhaps\r\ntwo thirds of it, or even three-quarters. If this be the case, the\r\npeasant, the former tax-payer, gave nothing or almost nothing from his\r\npocket during the first year of the Revolution. For instance, in regard\r\nto the patriotic contribution, the Assembly left it to the conscience of\r\neach person to fix his own quota; at the end of six months, consciences\r\nare found too elastic, and the Assembly is obliged to confer this right\r\non the municipalities. The result is[3248] that this or that individual\r\nwho taxed himself at forty-eight livres, is taxed at a hundred and\r\nfifty; another, a cultivator, who had offered six livres, is judged to\r\nbe able to pay over one hundred. Every regiment contains a small number\r\nof select brave men, and it is always these who are ready to advance\r\nunder fire. Every State contains a select few of honest men who advance\r\nto meet the tax-collector. Some effective constraint is essential in the\r\nregiment to supply those with courage who have but little, and in the\r\nState to supply those with probity who do not possess it. Hence, during\r\nthe eight months which follow, from May 1st, 1790, to January 1st, 1791,\r\nthe patriotic contribution furnishes but 11,000,000 livres. Two years\r\nlater, on the 1st of February, 1793, out of the forty thousand communal\r\ntax-rolls which should provide for it, there are seven thousand which\r\nare not yet drawn up; out of 180,000,000 livres which it ought\r\nto produce, there are 70,000,000 livres which are still due.--The\r\nresistance of the tax-payer produces a similar deficit, and similar\r\ndelays in all branches of the national income.[3249] In the month of\r\nJune, 1790, a deputy declares in the tribune that \"out of thirty-six\r\nmillions of imposts which ought to be returned each month only nine have\r\nbeen received.\"[3250] In the month of November, 1791, a reporter on\r\nthe budget states that the receipts, which should amount to forty or\r\nforty-eight millions a month, do not reach eleven millions and a half.\r\nOn February 1, 1793, there remains still due on the direct taxes of 1789\r\nand 1790 one hundred and seventy-six millions. It is evident that\r\nthe people struggle with all their might against the old taxes, even\r\nauthorized and prolonged by the Constituent Assembly, and all that is\r\nobtained from them is wrested from them.\r\n\r\nWill the people be more docile under the new taxation? The Assembly\r\nexhorts them to be so and shows them how, with the relief they have\r\ngained and with the patriotism they ought to possess, they can and\r\nshould discharge their dues. The people are able to do it because,\r\nhaving got rid of tithes, feudal dues, the salt-tax, octrois and excise\r\nduties, they are in a comfortable position. They should do so, because\r\nthe taxation adopted is indispensable to the State, equitable, assessed\r\non all in proportion to their fortune, collected and expended under\r\nrigid scrutiny, without perversion or waste, according to precise,\r\nclear, periodical and audited accounts. No doubt exists that, after the\r\n1st of January, 1791, the date when the new financial scheme comes into\r\noperation, each tax-payer will gladly pay as a good citizen, and the\r\ntwo hundred and forty millions of the new tax on real property, and\r\nthe sixty millions of that on personal property, leaving out the\r\nrest--registries, license, and customs duties--will flow in regularly\r\nand easily of their own accord.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, before the tax-gatherer can collect the first two levies\r\nthese have to be assessed, and as there are complicated writings\r\nand formalities, claims to settle amidst great resistance and local\r\nignorance, the operation is indefinitely prolonged. The personal and\r\nland-tax schedule of 1791 is not transmitted to the departments by the\r\nAssembly until June, 1791. The departments do not distribute it among\r\nthe districts until the months of July, August, and September, 1791. It\r\nis not distributed by the districts among the communes before October,\r\nNovember, and December, 1791. Thus in the last month of 1791 it is not\r\nyet distributed to the tax-payers by the communes; from which it follows\r\nthat on the budget of 1791 and throughout that year, the tax-payer\r\nhas paid nothing.--At last, in 1792, everybody begins to receive this\r\nassessment. It would require a volume to set forth the partiality and\r\ndissimulation of these assessments. In the first place the office of\r\nassessor is one of danger; the municipal authorities, whose duty it\r\nis to assign the quotas, are not comfortable in their town quarters.\r\nAlready, in 1790,[3251] the municipal officers of Monbazon have been\r\nthreatened with death if they dared to tax industrial pursuits on the\r\ntax-roll, and they escaped to Tours in the middle of the night. Even at\r\nTours, three or four hundred insurgents of the vicinity, dragging along\r\nwith them the municipal officers of three market-towns, come and declare\r\nto the town authorities \"that for all taxes they will not pay more than\r\nforty-five sous per household.\" I have already narrated how, in 1792,\r\nin the same department, \"they kill, they assassinate the municipal\r\nofficers\" who presume to publish the tax-rolls of personal property. In\r\nCreuse, at Clugnac, the moment the clerk begins to read the document,\r\nthe women spring upon him, seize the tax-roll, and \"tear it up with\r\ncountless imprecations;\" the municipal council is assailed, and two\r\nhundred persons stone its members, one of whom is thrown down, has his\r\nhead shaved, and is promenaded through the village in derision.--When\r\nthe small tax-payer defends himself in this manner, it is a warning that\r\nhe must be humored. The assessment, accordingly, in the village councils\r\nis made amongst a knot of cronies. Each relieves himself of the burden\r\nby shoving it off on somebody else. \"They tax the large proprietors,\r\nwhom they want to make pay the whole tax.\" The noble, the old seigneur,\r\nis the most taxed, and to such an extent that in many places his\r\nincome does not suffice to pay his quota.--In the next place they make\r\nthemselves out poor, and falsify or elude the prescriptions of the law.\r\n\"In most of the municipalities, houses, tenements, and factories[3252]\r\nare estimated according to the value of the area they cover, and\r\nconsidered as land of the first class, which reduces the quota to\r\nalmost nothing.\" And this fraud is not practiced in the villages alone.\r\n\"Communes of eight or ten thousand souls might be cited which have\r\narranged matters so well amongst themselves in this respect that not\r\na house is to be found worth more than fifty sous.\"--Last expedient\r\nof all, the commune defers as long as it can the preparation of its\r\ntax-rolls. On the 30th of January, 1792, out of 40,211, there are only\r\n2,560 which are complete; on the 5th of October, 1792, the schedules are\r\nnot made out in 4,800 municipalities, and it must be noted that all this\r\nrelates to a term of administration which has been finished for more\r\nthan nine months. At the same date, there are more than six thousand\r\ncommunes which have not yet begun to collect the land-tax of 1791, and\r\nmore than fifteen thousand communes which have not yet begun to collect\r\nthe personal tax; the Treasury and the departments have not yet received\r\n152,000,000 francs, there being still 222,000,000 to collect. On the 1st\r\nFebruary, 1793, there still remains due on the same period 161,000,000\r\nfrancs, while of the 50,000,000 assessed in 1790, to replace the\r\nsalt-tax and other suppressed duties, only 2,000,000 have been\r\ncollected. Finally, at the same date, out of the two direct taxes of\r\n1792, which should produce 300,000,000, less than 4,000,000 have been\r\nreceived.--It is a maxim of the debtor that he must put off payment as\r\nlong as possible. Whoever the creditor may be, the State or a private\r\nindividual, a leg or a wing may be saved by dint of procrastination. The\r\nmaxim is true, and, on this occasion, success once more demonstrates\r\nits soundness. During the year 1792, the peasant begins to discharge a\r\nportion of his arrears, but it is with assignats. In January, February,\r\nand March, 1792, the assignats diminish thirty-four, forty-four, and\r\nforty-five per cent. in value; in January, February, and March,\r\n1793, forty-seven and fifty percent.; in May, June, and July, 1793,\r\nfifty-four, sixty, and sixty-seven per cent. Thus has the old credit\r\nof the State melted away in its hands; those who have held on to their\r\ncrowns gain fifty per cent. and more. Again, the greater their delay the\r\nmore their debts diminish, and already, on the strength of this, the way\r\nto release themselves at half-price is found.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, hands are laid on the badly defended landed property of this\r\nfeeble creditor.--It is always difficult for rude brains to form any\r\nconception of the vague, invisible, abstract entity called the State,\r\nto regard it as a veritable personage and a legitimate proprietor,\r\nespecially when they are persistently told that the State is everybody.\r\nThe property of all is the property of each, and as the forests belong\r\nto the public, the first-comer has a right to profit by them. In the\r\nmonth of December, 1789,[3253] bands of sixty men or more chop down the\r\ntrees in the Bois de Boulogne and at Vincennes. In April, 1790, in the\r\nforest of Saint-Germain, \"the patrols arrest all kinds of delinquents\r\nday and night:\" handed over to the National Guards and municipalities in\r\nthe vicinity, these are \"almost immediately released, even with the\r\nwood which they have cut down against the law.\" iii There is no means\r\nof repressing \"the reiterated threats and insults of the low class of\r\npeople.\" A mob of women, urged on by an old French guardsman, come and\r\npillage under the nose of the escort a load of faggots confiscated for\r\nthe benefit of a hospital; and in the forest itself, bands of marauders\r\nfire upon the patrols.--At Chantilly, three game-keepers are mortally\r\nwounded;[3254] both parks are devastated for eighteen consecutive days;\r\nthe game is all killed, transported to Paris and sold.--At Chambord the\r\nlieutenant of the constabulary writes to announce his powerlessness; the\r\nwoods are ravaged and even burnt; the poachers are now masters of the\r\nsituation; breaches in the wall are made by them, and the water from\r\nthe pond is drawn off to enable them to catch the fish.--At Claix, in\r\nDauphiny, an officer of the jurisdiction of woods and forests, who has\r\nsecured an injunction against the inhabitants for cutting down trees on\r\nleased ground, is seized, tortured during five hours, and then stoned\r\nto death.--In vain does the National Assembly issue three decrees and\r\nregulations, placing the forests under the supervision and protection of\r\nadministrative bodies,--he latter are too much afraid of their charge.\r\nBetween the central power, which is weak and remote, and the people,\r\npresent and strong, they always decide in favor of the latter. Not one\r\nof the five municipalities surrounding Chantilly is disposed to assist\r\nin the execution of the laws, while the directories of the district\r\nand department respectively, sanction their inertia.--Similarly, near\r\nToulouse,[3255] where the magnificent forest of Larramet is devastated\r\nin open day and by an armed force, where the wanton destruction by\r\nthe populace leaves nothing of the underwood and shrubbery but \"a few\r\nscattered trees and the remains of trunks cut at different heights,\"\r\nthe municipalities of Toulouse and of Tournefeuille refuse all aid.\r\nAnd worse still, in other provinces, as for instance in Alsace, \"whole\r\nmunicipalities, with their mayors at the head, cut down woods which\r\nare confided to them, and carry them off.\"[3256] If some tribunal is\r\ndisposed to enforce the law, it is to no purpose; it takes the risk,\r\neither of not being allowed to give judgment, or of being constrained\r\nto reverse its decision. At Paris the judgment prepared against the\r\nincendiaries of the tax-offices could not be given. At Montargis, the\r\nsentence pronounced against the marauders who had stolen cartloads\r\nof wood in the national forests had to be revised, and by the judges\r\nthemselves. The moment the tribunal announced the confiscation of the\r\ncarts and horses which had been seized, there arose a furious outcry\r\nagainst it; the court was insulted by those present; the condemned\r\nparties openly declared that they would have their carts and horses back\r\nby force. Upon this \"the judges withdrew into the council-chamber, and\r\nwhen soon after they resumed their seats, that part of their decision\r\nwhich related to the confiscation was canceled.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet this administration of justice, ludicrous and flouted as it\r\nmay be, is still a sort of barrier. When it falls, along with the\r\nGovernment, everything is exposed to plunder, and there is no such thing\r\nas public property.--After August 10, 1792, each commune or individual\r\nappropriates whatever comes in its way, either products or the soil\r\nitself. Some of the plunderers go so far as to say that, since the\r\nGovernment no longer represses them, they act under its authority.[3257]\r\n\"They have destroyed even the recent plantation of young trees.\" \"One of\r\nthe villages near Fontainebleau cleared off and divided an entire grove.\r\nAt Rambouillet, from August 10th to the end of October,\" the loss is\r\nmore than 100,000 crowns; the rural agitators demand with threats the\r\npartition of the forest among the inhabitants. \"The destruction is\r\nenormous\" everywhere, prolonged for entire months, and of such a kind,\r\nsays the minister, as to dry up this source of public revenue for a\r\nlong time to come.--Communal property is no more respected than\r\nnational property. In each commune, these bold and needy folk, the rural\r\npopulace, are privileged to enjoy and make the most of it. Not content\r\nwith enjoying it, they desire to acquire ownership of it, and, for days\r\nafter the King's fall, the Legislative Assembly, losing its footing in\r\nthe universal breaking up, empowers the indigent to put in force the\r\nagrarian law. Henceforth it suffices in any commune for one-third of\r\nits inhabitants of both sexes, servants, common laborers, shepherds,\r\nfarm-hands or cowherds, and even paupers, to demand a partition of the\r\ncommunal possessions. All that the commune owns, save public edifices\r\nand woods, is to be cut up into as many equal lots as there are heads,\r\nthe lots to be drawn for, and each individual to take possession of his\r\nor her portion.[3258] The Operation is carried out, for \"those who\r\nare least well off are infinitely flattered by it.\" In the district of\r\nArcis-sur-Aube, there are not a dozen communes out of ninety in which\r\nmore than two-thirds of the voters had the good sense to pronounce\r\nagainst it. From this time forth the commune ceases to be an\r\nindependent proprietor; it has nothing to fall back upon. In case of\r\ndistress it is obliged to lay on extra taxes and obtain, if it can, a\r\nfew additional sous. Its future revenue is at present in the\r\ntightly buttoned pockets of the new proprietors.--The prevalence of\r\nshort-sighted views is once more due to the covetousness of individuals.\r\nWhether national or communal, it is always public interest which\r\nsuccumbs, and it succumbs always under the usurpations of indigent\r\nminorities, at one time through the feebleness of public authority,\r\nwhich dares not oppose their violence, and at another through the\r\ncomplicity of public authority, which has conferred upon them the rights\r\nof the majority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--Cupidity of tenants.\r\n\r\n     The third and fourth jacquerie.--Brittany and other\r\n     provinces in 1790 and 1791.--The burning of chateaux.\r\n     --Title-deeds destroyed.--Refusal of claims.--Destruction of\r\n     reservoirs.--Principal characteristics, prime motive and\r\n     ruling passion of the revolution\r\n\r\nWhen there is a lack of public force for the protection of public\r\nproperty, there is also a lack of it for the protection of private\r\nproperty, for the same greed and the same needs attack both. Let a man\r\nowe anything either to the State or to an individual, and the temptation\r\nnot to pay is equally the same. In both cases it suffices to find a\r\npretext for denying the debt; in finding this pretext the cupidity of\r\nthe tenant is as good as the selfishness of the tax-payer. Now that the\r\nfeudal system is abolished let nothing remain of it: let there be no\r\nmore seignorial claims. \"If the Assembly has maintained some of them,\r\nyonder in Paris, it did so inadvertently or through corruption: we\r\nshall soon hear of all being suppressed. In the meantime we will relieve\r\nourselves, and burn the agreements in the places where they are kept.\"\r\n\r\nSuch being the argument, the jacquerie breaks out afresh: in truth,\r\nit is permanent and universal. Just as in a body in which some of the\r\nelements of its vital substance are affected by an organic disease, the\r\nevil is apparent in the parts which seem to be sound: even where as yet\r\nno outbreak has occurred, one is imminent; constant anxiety, a profound\r\nrestlessness, a low fever, denote its presence. Here, the debtor does\r\nnot pay, and the creditor is afraid to prosecute him. In other places\r\nisolated eruptions occur. At Auxon,[3259] on an estate spared by the\r\ngreat jacquerie of July, 1789, the woods are ravaged, and the peasants,\r\nenraged at being denounced by the keepers, march to the chateau, which\r\nis occupied by an old man and a child; everybody belonging to the\r\nvillage is there, men and women; they hew down the barricaded door with\r\ntheir axes, and fire on the neighbors who come to the assistance of\r\nits inmates.--In other places, in the districts of Saint-Étienne and\r\nMontbrison, \"the trees belonging to the proprietors are carried\r\naway with impunity, and the walls of their grounds and terraces are\r\ndemolished, the complainants being threatened with death or with\r\nthe sight of the destruction of their dwellings.\" Near Paris, around\r\nMontargis, Nemours, and Fontainebleau, a number of parishes refuse\r\nto pay the tithes and ground-rent (champart) which the Assembly has\r\na second time sanctioned; gibbets are erected and the collectors are\r\nthreatened with hanging, while, in the neighborhood of Tonnerre, a\r\nmob of debtors fire upon the body of police which comes to enforce the\r\nclaims.--Near Amiens, the Comtesse de la Mire,[3260] on her estate of\r\nDavencourt, is visited by the municipal authorities of the village, who\r\nrequest her to renounce her right to ground-rent (champart) and thirds\r\n(tiers). She refuses and they insist, and she refuses again, when they\r\ninform her that \"some misfortune will happen to her.\" In effect, two\r\nof the municipal officers cause the tocsin to be rung, and the whole\r\nvillage rushes to arms. One of the domestics has an arm broken by a\r\nball, and for three hours the countess and her two children are subject\r\nto the grossest insults and to blows: she is forced to sign a paper\r\nwhich she is not allowed to read, and, in warding off the stroke of\r\na saber, her arm is cleft from the elbow to the wrist; the chateau\r\nis pillaged, and she owes her escape to the zeal of some of her\r\nservants.--Large eruptions take place at the same time over entire\r\nprovinces; one succeeds the other almost without interruption, the fever\r\nencroaching on parts which were supposed to be cured, and to such an\r\nextent that the virulent ulcers finally combine and form one over the\r\nwhole surface of the social body.\r\n\r\nBy the end of December, 1789, the chronic fermentation comes to a head\r\nin Brittany. Imagination, as usual, has forged a plot, and, as the\r\npeople say, if they make an attack it is in their own defense.--A report\r\nspreads[3261] that M. de Goyon, near Lamballe, has assembled in his\r\nchateau a number of gentlemen and six hundred soldiers. The mayor\r\nand National Guard of Lamballe immediately depart in force; they find\r\neverything tranquil there, and no company but two or three friends,\r\nand no other arms than a few fowling-pieces.--The impulse, however, is\r\ngiven, and, on the 15th of January, the great federation of Pontivy has\r\nexcited the wildest enthusiasm. The people drink, sing, and shout in\r\nhonor of the new decrees before armed peasants who do not comprehend the\r\nFrench tongue, still less legal terms, and who, on their return home,\r\narguing with each other in bas-breton, interpret the law in a peculiar\r\nway. \"A decree of the Assembly, in their eyes, is a decree of arrest\"\r\nand as the principal decrees of the Assembly are issued against the\r\nnobles, they are so many decrees of arrest against them.--Some days\r\nafter this, about the end of January, during the whole of February, and\r\ndown to the month of April, the execution of this theory is tumultuously\r\ncarried out by mobs of villagers and vagabonds around Nantes,\r\nAuray, Redon, Dinan, Ploërmel, Rennes, Guingamp, and other villages.\r\nEverywhere, writes the Mayor of Nantes,[3262] \"the country-people\r\nbelieve that in burning deeds and contracts they get rid of their debts;\r\nthe very best of them concur in this belief,\" or let things take\r\ntheir course; the excesses are enormous, because many gratify \"special\r\nanimosities, and all are heated with wine.--At Beuvres, \"the peasants\r\nand vassals of the manor, after burning title-deeds, establish\r\nthemselves in the chateau, and threaten to fire it if other papers,\r\nwhich they allege are concealed there, are not surrendered.\" Near Redon\r\nthe Abbey of Saint-Sauveur is reduced to ashes. Redon is menaced, and\r\nPloërmel almost besieged. At the end of a month thirty-seven chateaux\r\nare enumerated as attacked: twenty-five in which the title-deeds are\r\nburnt, and twelve in which the proprietors are obliged to sign an\r\nabandonment of their rights. Two chateaux which began to burn are saved\r\nby the National Guard. That of Bois-au-Voyer is entirely consumed,\r\nand several have been sacked. By way of addition, \"more than fifteen\r\nprocureurs-fiscaux, clerks, notaries, and officers of seignorial courts\r\nhave been plundered or burnt,\" while proprietors take refuge in the\r\ntowns because the country is now uninhabitable for them.\r\n\r\nA second tumor makes its appearance at the same time at another\r\npoint.[3263] It showed itself in Lower Limousin in the beginning of\r\nJanuary. From thence the purulent inflammation spreads to Quercy,\r\nUpper Languedoc, Perigord, and Rouergue, and in February from Tulle to\r\nMontauban, and from Agen to Périgueux and Cahors, extending over three\r\ndepartments.--Then, also, expectancy is the creator, according to rule,\r\nof its own object. By dint of longing for a law for the suppression\r\nof all claims, it is imagined that it is passed, and the statement\r\nis current that \"the King and the National Assembly have ordered\r\ndeputations to set up the maypole[3264] and to 'light up' the\r\nchateaux.\"--Moreover, and always in accordance with current practice,\r\nbandits, people without occupation, take the lead of the furious crowd\r\nand manage things their own way. As soon as a band is formed it arrests\r\nall the peaceable people it can find on the roads, in the fields, and in\r\nisolated farmhouses, and takes good care to put them in front in case\r\nof blows.--These miscreants add terror to compulsion. They erect gibbets\r\nfor any one that pays casual duties or annual dues, while the parishes\r\nof Quercy threaten their neighbors of Perigord with fire and sword in\r\na week's time if they do not do in Perigord as they have done in\r\nQuercy.--The tocsin rings, the drums beat, and \"the ceremony\" is\r\nperformed from commune to commune. The keys of the church are forcibly\r\ntaken from the curé the seats are burned, and, frequently, the woodwork\r\nmarked with the seigneur's arms. They march to the seigneur's mansion,\r\ntear down his weathercocks, and compel him to furnish his finest tree,\r\ntogether with feathers and ribbons with which to deck it, without\r\nomitting the three measures which he uses in the collection of his dues\r\nin grain or flour. The maypole is planted in the village square, and the\r\nweathercocks, ribbons, and feathers are attached to its top, together\r\nwith the three measures and this inscription, \"By order of the King and\r\nNational Assembly, the final quittance for all rentals.\" When this\r\nis done it is evident that the seigneur, who no longer possesses\r\nweathercocks, or a seat in the church, or measures to rate his dues by,\r\nis no longer a seigneur, and can no longer put forth claims of any kind.\r\nHuzzahs and acclamations accordingly burst forth, and there is a revel\r\nand an orgy on the public square. All who can pay--the seigneur, the\r\ncuré, and the rich--are put under contribution for the festival, while\r\nthe people eat and drink \"without any interval of sobriety.\"--In this\r\ncondition, being armed, they strike, and when resistance is offered,\r\nthey burn. In Agénois, a chateau belonging to M. de Lameth, and another\r\nof M. d'Aiguillon; in Upper Languedoc, that of M. de Bournazel, and in\r\nPerigord that of M. de Bar, are burnt down:\r\n\r\nM. de Bar is almost beaten to death, while six others are killed\r\nin Quercy. A number of chateaux in the environs of Montauban and in\r\nLimousin are assaulted with firearms, and several are pillaged.--Bands\r\nof twelve hundred men swarm the country; \"they have a spite against\r\nevery estate;\" they redress wrongs; \"they try over again cases\r\ndisposed of thirty years ago, and give judgments which they put into\r\nexecution.\"--If anybody fails to conform to the new code he is punished,\r\nand to the advantage of the new sovereigns. In Agénois, a gentleman\r\nhaving paid the rent which was associated with his fief the people take\r\nhis receipt from him, mulct him in a sum equal to that which he paid,\r\nand come under his windows to spend the money on good cheer, in triumph\r\nand with derision.\r\n\r\nMany of the National Guards who still possess some degree of energy,\r\nseveral of the municipalities which still preserve some love of order,\r\nand a number of the resident gentry, employ their arms against these\r\nexcited swarms of brutal usurpers. Some of the ruffians, taken in the\r\nact, are judged somewhat after the fashion of a drum-head court-martial,\r\nand immediately executed as examples. Everybody in the country sees\r\nthat the peril to society is great and urgent, and that if such acts go\r\nunpunished, there will be no such thing as law and property in\r\nFrance. The Bordeaux parliament, moreover, insists upon prosecutions.\r\nEighty-three boroughs and cities sign addresses, and send a special\r\ndeputation to the National Assembly to urge on prosecutions already\r\ncommenced, the punishment of criminals under arrest, and, above all,\r\nthe maintenance of the prévôtés.[3265] In reply to this, the Assembly\r\ninflicts upon the parliament of Bordeaux its disapprobation in the\r\nrudest manner, and enters upon the demolition of every judicial\r\ncorporation.[3266] After this, the execution of all prévotal decisions\r\nis adjourned. A few months later the Assembly will oblige the King to\r\ndeclare that the proceedings begun against the jacquerie of Brittany\r\nshall be regarded as null and void, and that the arrested insurgents\r\nshall be set free. For repressive purposes, it dispatches a sentimental\r\nexhortation to the French people, consisting of twelve pages of literary\r\ninsipidity, which Florian might have composed for his Estilles and\r\nhis Nemorins.[3267]--New conflagrations, as an inevitable consequence,\r\nkindle around live coals which have been imperfectly extinguished. In\r\nthe district of Saintes,[3268] M. Dupaty, counselor of the parliament of\r\nBordeaux, after having exhausted mild resources, and having concluded\r\nby issuing writs against those of his tenantry who would not pay their\r\nrents, the parish of Saint-Thomas de Cosnac, combined with five or six\r\nothers, puts itself in motion and assails his two chateaux of Bois-Roche\r\nand Saint-George-des-Agouts; these are plundered and then set on fire,\r\nhis son escaping through a volley of musket-balls. They visit Martin,\r\nthe notary and steward, in the same fashion; his furniture is pillaged\r\nand his money is taken, and \"his daughter undergoes the most frightful\r\noutrages.\" Another detachment pushes on to the house of-the Marquis\r\nde Cumont, and forces him, under the penalty of having his house burnt\r\ndown, to give a discharge for all the claims he has upon them. At the\r\nhead of these incendiaries are the municipal officers of Saint-Thomas,\r\nexcept the mayor, who has taken to flight.\r\n\r\nThe electoral system organized by the Constituent Assembly is beginning\r\nto take effect. \"Almost everywhere,\" writes the royal commissioner, \"the\r\nlarge proprietors have been eliminated, and the offices have been filled\r\nby men who strictly fulfill the conditions of eligibility. The result\r\nis a sort of rage of the petty rich to annoy those who enjoy large\r\nheritages.\"--Six months later, the National Guards and village\r\nauthorities in this same department at Aujean, Migron, and Varaise,\r\ndecide that no more tithes, agriers or champarts, nor any of the dues\r\nwhich are retained, shall be paid. In vain does the department annul the\r\ndecision, and send its commissioners, gendarmes, and law-officers. The\r\ncommissioners are driven away, and the officers and gendarmes are fired\r\nupon; the vice-president of the district, who was on his way to make his\r\nreport to the department, is seized on the road and forced to give in\r\nhis resignation. Seven parishes have coalesced with Aujean and ten\r\nwith Migron; Varaise has sounded the tocsin, and the villages for four\r\nleagues round have risen; fifteen hundred men, armed with guns, scythes,\r\nhatchets and pitchforks, lend their aid. The object is to set free\r\nthe principal leader at Varaise, one Planche, who was arrested, and\r\nto punish the mayor of Varaise, Latierce, who is suspected of having\r\ndenounced Planche. Latierce is unmercifully beaten, and \"forced to\r\nundergo a thousand torments during thirty hours;\" then they set out\r\nwith him to Saint-Jean-d'Angely, and demand the release of Planche. The\r\nmunicipality at first refuses, but finally consents on the condition\r\nthat Latierce be given up in exchange for him. Planche, consequently, is\r\nset at liberty and welcomed with shouts of triumph. Latierce, however,\r\nis not given up; on the contrary, he is tormented for an hour and then\r\nmassacred, while the directory of the district, which is less submissive\r\nthan the municipal body, is forced to fly.--Symptoms of this kind are\r\nnot to be mistaken, and similar ones exist in Brittany. It is evident\r\nthat the minds of the people are permanently in revolt. Instead of the\r\nsocial abscess being relieved by the discharge, it is always filling\r\nup and getting more inflamed. It will burst a second time in the same\r\nplaces; in 1791 as in 1790, the jacquerie spreads throughout Brittany as\r\nit has spread over Limousin.\r\n\r\nThis is because the determination of the peasant is of another nature\r\nthan ours, his will being more firm and tenacious. When an idea obtains\r\na hold on him it takes root in an obscure and profound conviction upon\r\nwhich neither discussion nor argument have any effect; once planted,\r\nit vegetates according to his notions, not according to ours, and no\r\nlegislative text, no judicial verdict, no administrative remonstrance\r\ncan change in any respect the fruit it produces. This fruit, developed\r\nduring centuries, is the feeling of an excessive plunder, and,\r\nconsequently, the need of an absolute release. Too much having been\r\npaid to everybody, the peasant now is not disposed to pay anything to\r\nanybody, and this idea, vainly repressed, always rises up in the manner\r\nof an instinct.--In the month of January, 1791,[3269] bands again\r\nform in Brittany, owing to the proprietors of the ancient fiefs having\r\ninsisted on the payment of their rents. At first the coalesced parishes\r\nrefuse to pay the stewards, and after this the rustic National Guards\r\nenter the chateaux to constrain the proprietors. Generally, it is the\r\ncommander of the National Guard, and sometimes the communal attorney,\r\nwho dictates to the lord of the manor the renunciation of his claims;\r\nthey oblige him, moreover, to sign notes for the benefit of the parish,\r\nor for that of various private individuals. This is considered by them\r\nto be compensation for damages; all feudal dues being abolished, he must\r\nreturn what he received from them during the past year, and as they have\r\nbeen put to inconvenience he must indemnify them by \"paying them for\r\ntheir time and journey.\" Such are the operations of two of the principal\r\nbands, one of them numbering fifteen hundred men, around Dinan and St.\r\nMalo; for greater security they burn title-deeds in the chateaux of\r\nSaint-Tual, Besso, Beaumanoir, La Rivière, La Bellière, Chateauneuf,\r\nChenay, Chausavoir, Tourdelon, and Chalonge; and as a climax they set\r\nfire to Chateauneuf just before the arrival of the regular troops.--In\r\nthe beginning, a dim conception of legal and social order seems to be\r\nfloating in their brains; at Saint-Tual, before taking 2,000 livres from\r\nthe steward, they oblige the mayor to give them his consent in writing;\r\nat Yvignac, their chief, called upon to show the authority under which\r\nhe acted, declares that \"he is authorized by the general will of the\r\npopulace of the nation.\"[3270]--But when, at the end of a month, they\r\nare beaten by the regular troops, made furious by the blows given and\r\ntaken, and excited by the weakness of the municipal authorities who\r\nrelease their prisoners, they then become bandits of the worst species.\r\nDuring the night of the 22nd of February, the chateau of Villefranche,\r\nthree leagues from Malestroit, is attacked. Thirty-two rascals with\r\ntheir faces masked, and led by a chief in the national uniform, break\r\nopen the door. The domestics are strangled. The proprietor, M. de la\r\nBourdonnaie, an old man, with his wife aged sixty, are half killed by\r\nblows and tied fast to their bed, and after this a fire is applied to\r\ntheir feet and they are warmed (chauffé). In the meantime the plate,\r\nlinen, stuffs, jewelry, two thousand francs in silver, and even watches,\r\nbuckles, and rings,--everything is pillaged, piled on the backs of\r\nthe eleven horses in the stables, and carried off.--When property is\r\nconcerned, one sort of outrage provokes another, the narrow cupidity\r\nof the lease-holder being completed by the unlimited rapacity of the\r\nbrigand.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the south-western provinces, the same causes have produced\r\nthe same results; and towards the end of autumn, when the crops are\r\ngathered in and the proprietors demand their dues in money or in\r\nproduce, the peasant, immovably fixed in his idea, again refuses.[3271]\r\nIn his eyes, any law that may be against him is not that of the\r\nNational Assembly, but of the so-called seigneurs, who have extorted or\r\nmanufactured it; and therefore it is null. The department and district\r\nadministrators may promulgate it as much as they please: it does not\r\nconcern him, and if the opportunity occurs, he knows how to make them\r\nsmart for it. The village National Guards, who are lease-holders like\r\nhimself, side with him, and instead of repressing him give him their\r\nsupport. As a commencement, he replants the maypoles, as a sign of\r\nemancipation, and erects the gibbet by way of a threat.--In the district\r\nof Gourdon, the regulars and the police having been sent to put them\r\ndown, the tocsin is at once sounded: a crowd of peasants, amounting to\r\nfour or five thousand, arrives from every surrounding parish, armed with\r\nscythes and guns; the soldiers, forming a body of one hundred, retire\r\ninto a church, where they capitulate after a siege of twenty-four hours,\r\nbeing obliged to give the names of the proprietors who demanded their\r\nintervention of the district, and who are Messrs. Hébray, de Fontange,\r\nand many others. All their houses are destroyed from top to bottom,\r\nand they effect their escape in order not to be hung. The chateaux of\r\nRepaire and Salviat are burned. At the expiration of eight days Quercy\r\nis in flames and thirty chateaux are destroyed.--The leader of a band\r\nof rustic National Guards, Joseph Linard, at the head of a village\r\narmy, penetrates into Gourdon, installs himself in the Hôtel-de-Ville,\r\ndeclares himself the people's protector against the directory of the\r\ndistrict, writes to the department in the name of his \"companions in\r\narms,\" and vaunts his patriotism. Meanwhile he commands as a conqueror,\r\nthrows open the prisons, and promises that, if the regular troops\r\nand police be sent off; he and his companions will withdraw in good\r\norder.--This species of tumultuous authority, however, instituted by\r\nacclamation for attack, is powerless for resistance. Scarcely has Linard\r\nretired when savagery is let loose. \"A price is set upon the heads\r\nof the administrators; their houses are the first devastated; all the\r\nhouses of wealthy citizens are pillaged; and the same is the case\r\nwith all chateaux and country habitations which display any signs of\r\nluxury.\"--Fifteen gentlemen, assembled together at the house of M.\r\nd'Escayrac, in Castel, appeal to all good citizens to march to the\r\nassistance of the proprietors who may be attacked in this jacquerie,\r\nwhich is spreading everywhere;[3272] but there are too few proprietors\r\nin the country, and none of the towns have too many of them for their\r\nown protection. M. d'Escayrac, after a few skirmishes, abandoned by the\r\nmunicipal officers of his village, and wounded, withdraws to the house\r\nof the Comte de Clarac, a major-general, in Languedoc. Here, too, the\r\nchateau, is surrounded,[3273] blockaded, and besieged by the local\r\nNational Guard. M. de Clarac descends and tries to hold a parley with\r\nthe attacking party, and is fired upon. He goes back inside and throws\r\nmoney out of the window; the money is gathered up, and he is again fired\r\nupon. The chateau is set on fire, and M. d'Escayrac receives five shots,\r\nand is killed. M. de Clarac, with another person, having taken refuge in\r\na subterranean vault, are taken out almost stifled the next morning but\r\none by the National Guard of the vicinity, who conduct them to Toulouse,\r\nwhere they are kept in prison and where the public prosecutor takes\r\nproceedings against them. The chateau of Bagat, near Montouq, is\r\ndemolished at the same time. The abbey of Espagnac, near Figeac, is\r\nassaulted with fire-arms; the abbess is forced to refund all rents she\r\nhas collected, and to restore four thousand livres for the expenses of a\r\ntrial which the convent had gained twenty years before.\r\n\r\nAfter such successes, the extension of the revolt is inevitable; and\r\nat the end of some weeks and months it becomes permanent in the three\r\nneighboring departments.--In Creuse,[3274] the judges are threatened\r\nwith death if they order the payment of seignorial dues, and the same\r\nfate awaits all proprietors who claim their rents. In many places, and\r\nespecially in the mountains, the peasants, \"considering that they form\r\nthe nation, and that clerical possessions are national,\" want to have\r\nthese divided amongst themselves, instead of their being sold. Fifty\r\nparishes around La Souterraine receive incendiary letters inviting them\r\nto come in arms to the town, in order to secure by force, and by staking\r\ntheir lives, the production of all titles to rentals. The peasants, in a\r\ncircle of eight leagues, are all stirred up by the sound of the tocsin,\r\nand preceded by the municipal officers in their scarves; there are four\r\nthousand of them, and they drag with them a wagon full of arms: this is\r\nfor the revision and re-constitution of the ownership of the soil.--In\r\nDordogne,[3275] self-appointed arbitrators interpose imperiously between\r\nthe proprietor and the small farmer, at the time of harvest, to prevent\r\nthe proprietor from claiming, and the farmer from paying, the tithes or\r\nthe réve;[3276] any agreement to this end is forbidden; whoever shall\r\ntransgress the new order of things, proprietor or farmer, shall be hung.\r\nAccordingly, the rural militia in the districts of Bergerac, Excideuil,\r\nRibérac, Mucidan, Montignac, and Perigueux, led by the municipal\r\nofficers, go from commune to commune in order to force the proprietors\r\nto sign an act of withdrawal; and these visits \"are always accompanied\r\nwith robberies, outrages, and ill-treatment from which there is no\r\nescape but in absolute submission.\" Moreover, \"they demand the abolition\r\nof every species of tax and the partition of the soil. \"--It is\r\nimpossible for \"proprietors moderately rich\" to remain in the country;\r\non all sides they take refuge in Perigueux, and there, organizing in\r\ncompanies, along with the gendarmerie and the National Guard of the\r\ntown, overrun the cantons to restore order. But there is no way of\r\npersuading the peasantry that it is order which they wish to restore.\r\nWith that stubbornness of the imagination which no obstacle arrests,\r\nand which, like a vigorous spring, always finds some outlet, the people\r\ndeclare that \"the gendarmes and National Guard\" who come to restrain\r\nthem \"are priests and gentlemen in disguise.\"--The new theories,\r\nmoreover, have struck down to the lowest depths; and nothing is easier\r\nthan to draw from them the abolition of debts, and even the agrarian\r\nlaw. At Ribérac, which is invaded by the people of the neighboring\r\nparishes, a village tailor, taking the catechism of the Constitution\r\nfrom his pocket, argues with the procureur-syndic, and proves to him\r\nthat the insurgents are only exercising the rights of man. The book\r\nstates, in the first place, \"that Frenchmen are equals and brethren,\r\nand that they should give each other aid;\" and that \"the masters\r\nshould share with their fellows, especially this year, which is one of\r\nscarcity.\" In the next place, it is written that \"all property belongs\r\nto the nation,\" and that is the reason why \"it has taken the possessions\r\nof the Church.\" Now, all Frenchmen compose the nation, and the\r\nconclusion is clearly apparent. Since, in the eyes of the tailor, the\r\nproperty of individual Frenchmen belongs to all the French, he, the\r\ntailor, has a right to at least the quota which belongs to him.--One\r\ntravels fast and far on this downhill road, for every mob considers\r\nthat this means immediate enjoyment, and enjoyment according to its own\r\nideas. There is no care for neighbors or for consequences, even when\r\nimminent and physical, and in twenty places the confiscated property\r\nperishes in the hands of the usurpers.\r\n\r\nThis voluntary destruction of property can be best observed in the\r\nthird department, that of Corrèze.[3277] Not only have the peasants here\r\nrefused to pay rents from the beginning of the Revolution; not only have\r\nthey \"planted maypoles, supplied with iron hooks, to hang the first\r\none that dared to claim or to pay them;\" not only are violent acts of\r\nevery description committed \"by entire communes,\" \"the National Guards\r\nof the small communes participating in them;\" not only do the culprits,\r\nwhose arrest is ordered, remain at liberty, while \"nothing is spoken\r\nof but the hanging of the constables who serve writs,\" but farther,\r\ntogether with the ownership of the water-sources, the power of\r\ncollecting, directing, and distributing the water is overthrown, and, in\r\na country of in a country of steep slopes, the consequences of such\r\nan operation may be imagined. Three leagues from Tulle, in a forming a\r\nsemi-circle, a pond twenty feet in depth, and covering an area of three\r\nhundred acres, was enclosed by a broad embankment on the side of a\r\nvery deep gorge, which was completely covered with houses, mills, and\r\ncultivation. On the 17th of April, 1791, a troop of five hundred armed\r\nmen assembled by the beat of a drum, and collected from three villages\r\nin the vicinity, set themselves to demolish the dike. The proprietor,\r\nM. de Sedières, a substitute-deputy in the National Assembly, is not\r\nadvised of it until eleven o'clock in the evening. Mounting his horse,\r\nalong with his guests and domestics, he makes a charge on the insane\r\nwretches, and, with the aid of pistol and gun shots, disperses them. It\r\nwas time, for the trench they had dug was already eight feet deep,\r\nand the water was nearly on a level with it: a half-hour later and the\r\nterrible rolling mass of waters would have poured out on the inhabitants\r\nof the gorge.--But such vigorous strokes, which are rare and hardly ever\r\nsuccessful, are no defense against universal and continuous attacks.\r\nThe regular troops and the gendarmerie, both of which are in the way of\r\nreorganization or of dissolution, are not trustworthy, or are too weak.\r\nThere are no more than thirty of the cavalry in Creuse, and as many in\r\nCorrèze. The National Guards of the towns are knocked up by expeditions\r\ninto the country, and there is no money with which to provide for their\r\nchange of quarters. And finally, as the elections are in the hands of\r\nthe people, this brings into power men disposed to tolerate popular\r\nexcesses. At Tulle, the electors of the second class, almost all chosen\r\nfrom among the cultivators, and, moreover, catechized by the club,\r\nnominate for deputies and public prosecutor only the candidates who are\r\npledged against rentals and against water privileges.--Accordingly, the\r\ngeneral demolition of the dikes begins as the month of May approaches.\r\nThis operation continues unopposed on a vast pond, a league and a half\r\nfrom the town, and lasts for a whole week; elsewhere, on the arrival of\r\nthe guards or of the gendarmerie, they are fired upon. Towards the end\r\nof September, all the embankments in the department are broken down:\r\nnothing is left in the place of the ponds but fetid marshes; the\r\nmill-wheels no longer turn, and the fields are no longer watered. But\r\nthose who demolish them carry away baskets full of fish, and the soil of\r\nthe ponds again becomes communal.--Hatred is not the motive which impels\r\nthem, but the instinct of acquisition: all these violent outstretched\r\nhands, which rigidly resist the law, are directed against property, but\r\nnot against the proprietor; they are more greedy than hostile. One of\r\nthe noblemen of Corrèze,[3278] M. de Saint-Victour, has been absent for\r\nfive years. From the beginning of the Revolution, although his feudal\r\ndues constitute one-half of the income of his estate, he has given\r\norders that no rigorous measures shall be employed in their collection,\r\nand the result is that, since 1789, none of them were collected.\r\nMoreover, having a reserve stock of wheat on hand, he lent grain, to the\r\namount of four thousand francs, to those of his tenants who had none.\r\nIn short, he is liberal, and, in the neighboring town, at Ussel, he even\r\npasses for a Jacobin. In spite of all this, he is treated just like the\r\nrest. It is because the parishes in his domain are \"clubbist,\" governed\r\nby associations of moral and practical levelers; in one of them \"the\r\nbrigands have organized themselves into a municipal body,\" and have\r\nchosen their leader as procureur-syndic. Consequently, on the 22nd of\r\nAugust, eighty armed peasants opened the dam of his large pond, at the\r\nrisk of submerging a village in the neighborhood, the inhabitants of\r\nwhich came and closed it up. Five other ponds belonging to him are\r\ndemolished in the course of the two following weeks; fish to the value\r\nof from four to five thousand francs are stolen, and the rest perish in\r\nthe weeds. In order to make this expropriation sure, an effort is made\r\nto burn his title-deeds; his chateau, twice attacked in the night, is\r\nsaved only by the National Guard of Ussel. His farmers and domestics\r\nhesitate, for the time being, whether or not to cultivate the ground,\r\nand come and ask the steward if they could sow the seeds. There is no\r\nrecourse to the proper authorities: the administrators and judges, even\r\nwhen their own property is concerned, \"dare not openly show themselves,\"\r\nbecause \"they do not find themselves protected by the shield of the law.\r\n\"--Popular will, traversing both the old and the new law, obstinately\r\npersists in its work, and forcibly attains its ends. Thus, whatever the\r\ngrand terms of liberty, equality, and fraternity may be, with which the\r\nRevolution graces itself, it is, in its essence, a transfer of property;\r\nin this alone consists its chief support, its enduring energy,\r\nits primary impulse and its historical significance.--Formerly, in\r\nantiquity, similar movements were accomplished, debts were abolished or\r\nlessened, the possessions of the rich were confiscated, and the public\r\nlands were divided; but this operation was confined to a city and\r\nlimited to a small territory. For the first time it takes place on a\r\nlarge scale and in a modern State.--Thus far, in these vast States, when\r\nthe deeper foundations have been disturbed, it has ever been on account\r\nof foreign domination or on account of an oppression of conscience.\r\nIn France in the fifteenth century, in Holland in the sixteenth and in\r\nEngland in the seventeenth century, the peasant, the mechanic, and the\r\nlaborer had taken up arms against an enemy or in behalf of their faith.\r\nOn religious or patriotic zeal has followed the craving for prosperity\r\nand comfort, and the new motive is as powerful as the others; for in\r\nour industrial, democratic, and utilitarian societies it is this which\r\ngoverns almost all lives, and excites almost all efforts. Kept down for\r\ncenturies, the passion recovers itself by throwing off government\r\nand privilege, the two great weights which have borne it down. At the\r\npresent time this passion launches itself impetuously with its whole\r\nforce, with brutal insensibility, athwart every kind of proprietorship\r\nthat is legal and legitimate, whether it be public or private. The\r\nobstacles it encounters only render it the more destructive,\r\nbeyond property it attacks proprietors, and completes plunder with\r\nproscriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3201: The expression is that of Jean Bon Saint-André to\r\nMathieu Dumas, sent to re-establish tranquillity in Montauban (1790):\r\n\"The day of vengeance, which we have been awaiting for a hundred years,\r\nhas come!\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3202: De Dampmartin, I. 187 (an eye-witness).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3203: \"Archives Nationales,\" F7, 3223 and 3216.

Development of the ruling Passion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--Attitude of the nobles. Their moderate resistance.\r\n\r\nIf popular passion ended in murder it was not because resistance was\r\ngreat or violent. On the contrary, never did an aristocracy undergo\r\ndispossession with so much patience, or employ less force in the defense\r\nof its prerogatives, or even of its property. To speak with exactness,\r\nthe class in question receives blows without returning them, and when\r\nit does take up arms, it is always with the bourgeois and the National\r\nGuard, at the request of the magistrates, in conformity with the law,\r\nand for the protection of persons and property. The nobles try to avoid\r\nbeing either killed or robbed, nothing more: for nearly three years\r\nthey raise no political banner. In the towns where they exert the most\r\ninfluence and which are denounced as rebellious, for ex-ample in Mende\r\nand Arles, their opposition is limited to the suppression of riots, the\r\nrestraining of the common people, and ensuring respect for the law, It\r\nis not the new order of things against which they conspire, but against\r\nbrutal disorder.--At Mende,\" says the municipal body,[3301] \"we had\r\nthe honor of being the first to furnish the contributions of 1790. We\r\nsupplied the place of our bishop and installed his successor without\r\ndisturbance, and without the assistance of any foreign force . . . . We\r\ndispersed the members of a cathedral body to which we were attached by\r\nthe ties of blood and friendship; we dismissed all, from the bishop down\r\nto the children of the choir. We had but three communities of mendicant\r\nmonks, and all three have been suppressed. We have sold all national\r\npossessions without exception.\"--The commander of their gendarmerie is,\r\nin fact, an old member of the body-guard, while the superior officers of\r\nthe National Guard are gentlemen, or belong to the order of Saint-Louis.\r\nIt is very evident that, if they defend themselves against Jacobins,\r\nthey are not insurgent against the National Assembly.--In Arles,[3302]\r\nwhich has put down its populace, which has armed itself, which has shut\r\nits gates, and which passes for a focus of royalist conspiracy, the\r\ncommissioners sent by the King and by the National Assembly, men\r\nof discretion and of consideration, find nothing, after a month's\r\ninvestigation, but submission to the decrees and zeal for the public\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\n\"Such,\" they say, \"are the men who have been calumniated because,\r\ncherishing the Constitution, they hold fanaticism, demagogues and\r\nanarchy, in horror. If the citizens had not roused themselves when the\r\nmoment of danger arrived, they would have been slaughtered like their\r\nneighbors (of Avignon). It is this insurrection against crime which the\r\nbrigands have slandered.\" If their gates were shut it was because \"the\r\nNational Guard of Marseilles, the same which behaved so badly in the\r\nComtat, flocked there under the pretext of maintaining liberty and of\r\nforestalling the counter-revolution, but, in reality, to village the\r\ntown.\"\r\n\r\nVive la Nation! Vive la Loi! Vive le Roi were the only cries heard at\r\nthe very quiet and orderly elections that had just taken place.\r\n\r\n\"The attachment of the citizens to the Constitution has been spoken\r\nof. . . . Obedience to the laws, the readiest disposition to discharge\r\npublic contributions, were remarked by us among these pretended\r\ncounter-revolutionaries. Those who are subject to the license-tax came\r\nin crowds to the Hôtel-de-Ville.\" Scarcely \"was the bureau of receipts\r\nopened when it was filled with respectable people; those on the contrary\r\nwho style themselves good patriots, republicans or anarchists, were not\r\nconspicuous on this occasion; but a very small number among them have\r\nmade their submission. The rest are surprised at being called upon for\r\nmoney; they had been given a quite different hope.\"\r\n\r\nIn short, during more than thirty months, and under a steady fire of\r\nthreats, outrages, and plunder, the nobles who remain in France neither\r\ncommit nor undertake any hostile act against the Government that\r\npersecutes them. None of them, not even M. de Bouillé, attempts to carry\r\nout any real plan of civil war; I find but one resolute man in their\r\nranks at this date, ready for action, and who labors to form one\r\nmilitant party against another militant party: he is really a politician\r\nand conspirator; he has an understanding with the Comte d'Artois; he\r\ngets petitions signed for the freedom of the King and of the Church;\r\nhe organizes armed companies; he recruits the peasants; he prepares\r\na Vendée for Languedoc and Provence; and this person is a bourgeois,\r\nFroment of Nîmes.[3303] But, at the moment of action, he finds only\r\nthree out of eighteen companies, supposed by him to be enlisted in\r\nhis cause, that are willing to march with him. Others remain in their\r\nquarters until, Froment being overcome, they are found there and\r\nslaughtered; the survivors, who escape to Jalès, find, not a stronghold,\r\nbut a temporary asylum, where they never succeed in transforming their\r\ninclinations into determinations.[3304]--The nobles too, like other\r\nFrenchmen, have been subject to the lasting pressure of monarchical\r\ncentralization. They no longer form one body; they have lost the\r\ninstinct of association. They no longer know how to act for themselves;\r\nthey are the puppets of administration awaiting an impulse from the\r\ncenter, while at the center the King, their hereditary general, a\r\ncaptive in the hands of the people, commands them to be resigned and to\r\ndo nothing.[3305] Moreover, like other Frenchmen, they have been\r\nbrought up in the philosophy of the eighteenth century. \"Liberty is\r\nso precious,\" wrote the Duc de Brissac,[3306] \"that it may well be\r\npurchased with some suffering; a destroyed feudalism will not prevent\r\nthe good and the true from being respected and loved.\"--They persist in\r\nthis illusion for a long time and remain optimists. As they feel kindly\r\ntowards the people, they cannot comprehend that the people should\r\nentertain other sentiments toward them; they firmly believe that\r\nthe troubles are transient. Immediately on the proclamation of the\r\nConstitution they return in crowds from Spain, Belgium, and Germany;\r\nat Troyes there are not enough post-horses for many days to supply\r\nthe emigrants who are coming back.[3307] Thus they accept not only the\r\nabolition of feudalism with civil equality, but also political equality\r\nand numerical sovereignty.\r\n\r\nSome consideration for them, some outward signs of respect, a few bows,\r\nwould, in all probability, have rallied them sincerely to democratic\r\ninstitutions. They would soon consent to be confounded with the crowd,\r\nto submit to the common level, and to live as private individuals. Had\r\nthey been treated like the bourgeois or the peasant, their neighbors,\r\nhad their property and persons been respected, they might have accepted\r\nthe new régime without any bitterness of feeling. That the leading\r\nemigrant nobles and those forming a part of the old court carry on\r\nintrigues at Coblentz or at Turin is natural, since they have lost\r\neverything: authority, places, pensions, sinecures, pleasures, and\r\nthe rest. But, to the gentry and inferior nobles of the provinces,\r\nchevaliers of Saint-Louis, subaltern officers and resident proprietors,\r\nthe loss is insignificant. The law has suppressed one-half of their\r\nseignorial dues; but by virtue of the same law their lands are no longer\r\nburdened with tithes. Popular elections will not provide them with\r\nplaces, but they did not enjoy them under the arbitrary ministerial\r\nrule. Little does it matter to them that power, whether ministerial or\r\npopular, has changed hands: they are not accustomed to its favors, and\r\nwill pursue their ordinary avocations--the chase, promenading, reading,\r\nvisiting, and conversing--provided they, like the first-comer, the\r\ngrocer at the corner, or their farm-servant, find protection, safety,\r\nand security on the public road and in their dwellings.[3308]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--Workings of the popular imagination with respect to them.\r\n\r\n     The monomania of suspicion.--The nobles distrusted and\r\n     treated as enemies.--Situation of a gentleman on his\r\n     domain.--M. de. Bussy\r\n\r\nPopular passion, unfortunately, is a blind power, and, for lack of\r\nenlightenment, suffers itself to be guided by spectral illusions.\r\nImaginary conceptions work, and work in conformity with the structure of\r\nthe excited brain which has given birth to them:\r\n\r\nWhat if the Ancient Regime should return!\r\n\r\nWhat if we were obliged to restore the property of the clergy!\r\n\r\nWhat if we should be again forced to pay the salt tax, the excise,\r\nthe taille, and other dues which, thanks to the law, we no longer pay,\r\nbesides other taxes and dues that we do not pay in spite of the law!\r\n\r\nWhat if all the nobles whose chateaux are burnt, and who have given rent\r\nacquittances at the point of the sword, should find some way to avenge\r\nthemselves and recover their former privileges!\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly they brood over these things, make agreements amongst each\r\nother, and plot with the strangers; at the first opportunity they\r\nwill fall upon us: we must watch them, repress them, and, if needs be,\r\ndestroy them.--This instinctive process of reasoning prevailed from\r\nthe outset, and, in proportion as excesses increase, prevails to a\r\nmuch greater extent. The noble is ever the past, present, and future\r\ncreditor, or, at the very least, a possible one, which means that he is\r\nthe worst and most odious of enemies. All his ways are suspicious, even\r\nwhen he is doing nothing; whatever he may do it is with a view of arming\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nM. de Gilliers, who lives with his wife and sister one league out of\r\nRomans in Dauphiny,[3309] amuses himself by planting trees and flowers;\r\na few steps from his house, on another domain, M. de Montchorel, an old\r\nsoldier, and M. Osmond, an old lawyer from Paris, with their wives and\r\nchildren, occupy their leisure hours in somewhat the same manner. M.\r\nde Gilliers having ordered and received wooden water-pipes, the report\r\nspreads that they are cannon. His guest, M. Servan, receives an English\r\ntraveling-trunk, which is said to be full of pistols. When M. Osmond and\r\nM. Servan stroll about the country with pencils and drawing-paper, it\r\nis averred that they are preparing topographical plans for the Spaniards\r\nand Savoyards. The four carriages belonging to the two families go to\r\nRomans to fetch some guests: instead of four there are nineteen, and\r\nthey are sent for aristocrats who are coming to hide away in underground\r\npassages. M. de Senneville, decorated with a cordon rouge (red ribbon),\r\npays a visit on his return from Algiers: the decoration becomes a blue\r\none, and the wearer is the Comte d'Artois[3310] in person. There is\r\ncertainly a plot brewing, and at five o'clock in the morning eighteen\r\ncommunes (two thousand armed men) arrive before the doors of the two\r\nhouses; shouts and threats of death last for eight hours; a gun fired a\r\nfew paces off at the suspects misfires; a peasant who is aiming at them\r\nsays to his neighbor, \"Give me a decent gun and I will plant both\r\nmy balls in their bodies!\" Finally, M. de Gilliers, who was absent,\r\nattending a baptism, returns with the Royal Chasseurs of Dauphiny and\r\nthe National Guard of Romans, and with their assistance delivers his\r\nfamily.--It is only in the towns, that is, in a few towns, and for a\r\nvery short time, that an inoffensive noble who is attacked obtains any\r\naid; the phantoms which people create for themselves there are less\r\ngross; a certain degree of enlightenment, and a remnant of common sense,\r\nprevent the hatching of too absurd stories.--But in the dark recesses\r\nof rustic brains nothing can arrest the monomania of suspicion. Fancies\r\nmultiply there like weeds in a dark hole: they take root and vegetate\r\nuntil they become belief, conviction, and certainty; they produce the\r\nfruit of hostility and hatred, homicidal and incendiary ideas. With eyes\r\nconstantly fixed on the chateau, the village regards it as a Bastille\r\nwhich must be captured, and, instead of saluting the lord of the manor,\r\nit thinks only of firing at him.\r\n\r\nLet us take up one of these local histories in detail.[3311] In the\r\nmonth of July, 1789, during the jacquerie in Mâçonnais, the parish of\r\nVilliers appealed for assistance to its lord, M. de Bussy, a former\r\ncolonel of dragoons. He had returned home, treated the people of his\r\nvillage to a dinner, and attempted to form them into a body of guards\r\nto protect themselves against incendiaries and brigands; along with the\r\nwell-disposed men of the place \"he patrolled every evening to restore\r\ntranquillity to the parish.\" On a rumor spreading that \"the wells were\r\npoisoned,\" he placed sentinels alongside of all the wells except his\r\nown, \"to prove that he was acting for the parish and not for himself.\"\r\nIn short, he did all he could to conciliate the villagers, and to\r\ninterest them in the common safety.--But, by virtue of being a noble\r\nand an officer he is distrusted, and it is Perron, the syndic of the\r\ncommune, to whom the commune now listens. Perron announces that the King\r\n\"having abjured his sworn word,\" no more confidence is to be placed in\r\nhim, and, consequently, neither in his officers nor in the gentry. On\r\nM. de Bussy proposing to the National Guards that they should go to the\r\nassistance of the chateau of Thil, which is in flames, Perron prevents\r\nthem, declaring that \"these fires are kindled by the nobles and the\r\nclergy.\" M. de Bussy insists, and entreats them to go, offering to\r\nabandon \"his terrier,\" that is to say all his seignorial dues, if they\r\nwill only accompany him and arrest this destruction. They refuse to do\r\nso. He perseveres, and, on being informed that the chateau of Juillenas\r\nis in peril, he collects, after great efforts, a body of one hundred\r\nand fifty men of his parish, and, marching with them, arrives in time to\r\nsave the chateau, which a mob was about to set on fire. But the popular\r\nexcitement, which he had just succeeded in calming at Juillenas, has\r\ngained the upper hand amongst his own troop: the brigands have seduced\r\nhis men, \"which obliges him to lead them back, while, along the road,\r\nthey seem inclined to fire at him.\"--Having returned, he is followed\r\nwith threats even to his own house: a band comes to attack his chateau;\r\nfinding it on the defensive, they insist on being led to that of\r\nCourcelles.--In the midst of all this violence M. de Bussy, with about\r\nfifteen friends and tenants, succeeds in protecting himself and, by\r\ndint of patience, energy, and cool blood, without killing or wounding a\r\nsingle man, ends in bringing back security throughout the whole canton.\r\nThe jacquerie subsides, and it seems as if the newly restored order\r\nwould be maintained. He sends for Madame de Bussy to return, and some\r\nmonths pass away.--The popular imagination, however, is poisoned, and\r\nwhatever a gentleman may do, he is no longer tolerated on his estate. A\r\nfew leagues from there, on April 29, 1790, M. de Bois-d'Aisy, deputy\r\nto the National Assembly, had returned to his parish to vote at the\r\nnew elections.[3312] \"Scarcely has he arrived,\" when the commune of\r\nBois-d'Aisy gives him notice through its mayor \"that it will not regard\r\nhim as eligible.\" He attends the electoral meeting which is held in the\r\nchurch there, a municipal officer in the pulpit inveighs against nobles\r\nand priests, and declares that they must not take part in the elections.\r\nAll eyes turn upon M. de Boisd'Aisy, who is the only noble present.\r\nNevertheless, he takes the civic oath, which nearly costs him dear, for\r\nmurmurs arise around him, and the peasants say that he ought to have\r\nbeen hanged like the lord of Sainte-Colombe, to prevent his taking the\r\noath. In fact, the evening before, the latter, M. de Vitteaux, an\r\nold man of seventy-four years of age, was expelled from the primary\r\nassembly, then torn out of the house in which he had sought refuge, half\r\nkilled with blows, and dragged through the streets to the open square;\r\nhis mouth was stuffed with manure, a stick was thrust into his ears,\r\nand \"he expired after a martyrdom of three hours.\" The same day, in the\r\nchurch of the Capuchins, at Sémur, the rural parishes which met together\r\nexcluded their priests and gentry in the same fashion. M. de Damas\r\nand M. de Sainte-Maure were beaten with clubs and stones; the curé\r\nof Massigny died after six stabs with a knife, and M. de Virieu saved\r\nhimself as he best could.--With such examples before them it is probable\r\nthat many of the nobles will no longer exercise their right of suffrage.\r\nM. de Bussy does not pretend to do it. He merely tries to prove that he\r\nis loyal to the nation, and that he meditates no wrong to the National\r\nGuard or to the people. He proposed, at the out-set, to the volunteers\r\nof Mâçon to join them, along with his little troop; they refused to have\r\nhim and thus the fault is not on his side. On the 14th of July, 1790,\r\nthe day of the Federation on his domain, he sends all his people off to\r\nVilliers, furnished with the tricolour cockade. He himself, with three\r\nof his friends, attends the ceremony to take the oath, all four in\r\nuniform, with the cockade on their hats, without any weapons but their\r\nswords and a light cane in their hands. They salute the assembled\r\nNational Guards of the three neighboring parishes, and keep outside\r\nthe enclosure so as not to give offense. But they have not taken into\r\naccount the prejudices and animosities of the new municipal bodies.\r\nPerron, the former syndic, is now mayor. A man named Bailly, who is the\r\nvillage shoemaker, is another of the municipal officers; their councilor\r\nis an old dragoon, one of those soldiers probably who have deserted or\r\nbeen discharged, and who are the firebrands of almost every riot that\r\ntakes place. A squad of a dozen or fifteen men leave the ranks and\r\nmarch up to the four gentlemen, who advance, hat in hand, to meet them.\r\nSuddenly the men aim at them, and Bailly, with a furious air, demands:\r\n\"What the devil do you come here for?\" M. de Bussy replies that, having\r\nbeen informed of the Federation, he had come to take the oath like\r\nthe rest of the people. Bailly asks why he had come armed. M. de Bussy\r\nremarks that \"having been in the service, the sword was inseparable from\r\nthe uniform,\" and had they come there without that badge they would have\r\nbeen at fault; besides, they must have observed that they had no other\r\narms. Bailly, still in a rage, and, moreover, exasperated by such good\r\nreasons, turns round with his gun in his hand towards the leader of the\r\nsquad and asks him three times in succession, \"Commander, must I fire?\"\r\nThe commander not daring to take the responsibility of so gratuitous a\r\nmurder, remains silent, and finally orders M. de Bussy to \"clear out;\"\r\n\"which I did,\" says M. de Bussy.--Nevertheless, on reaching home, he\r\nwrites to the municipal authorities clearly setting forth the motive of\r\nhis coming, and demands an explanation of the treatment he had received.\r\nMayor Perron throws aside his letter without reading it, and, on the\r\nfollowing day, on leaving the mass, the National Guards come, by way of\r\nmenace, to load their guns in sight of M. de Bussy, round his garden.--A\r\nfew days after this, at the instigation of Bailly, two other proprietors\r\nin the neighborhood are assassinated in their houses. Finally, on a\r\njourney to Lyons, M. de Bussy learns \"that the chateaux in Poitou\r\nare again in flames, and that the work is to begin again\r\neverywhere.\"--Alarmed at all these indications, \"he resolves to form a\r\ncompany of volunteers, which, taking up their quarters in his chateau,\r\ncan serve the whole canton on a legal requisition.\" He thinks that about\r\nfifteen brave men will be sufficient. He has already six men with him\r\nin the month of October, 1790; green coats are ordered for them, and\r\nbuttons are bought for the uniform. Seven or eight domestics may be\r\nadded to the number. In the way of arms and munitions the chateau\r\ncontains two kegs of gunpowder which were on hand before 1789, seven\r\nblunderbusses, and five cavalry sabers, left there in passing by M.\r\nde Bussy's old dragoons: to these must be added two double-barreled\r\nfowling-pieces, three soldiers' muskets, five brace of pistols, two poor\r\ncommon guns, two old swords, and a hunting-knife. Such is the garrison,\r\nsuch the arsenal, and these are the preparations, so well justified and\r\nso slight, which prejudice conjointly with gossip is about to transform\r\ninto a great conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThe chateau, in effect, was an object of suspicion in the village from\r\nthe very first day. All its visitors, whenever they went out or came\r\nin, with all the details of their actions, were watched, denounced,\r\nexaggerated, and misinterpreted. If through the awkwardness or\r\ncarelessness of so many inexperienced National Guards, a stray ball\r\nreaches a farm-house one day in broad daylight, it comes from the\r\nchateau; it is the aristocrats who have fired upon the peasants.--There\r\nis the same state of suspicion in the neighboring towns. The municipal\r\nbody of Valence, hearing that two youths had ordered coats made \"of a\r\ncolor which seemed suspicious,\" send for the tailor; he confesses the\r\nfact, and adds that \"they intended to put the buttons on themselves.\"\r\nSuch a detail is alarming. An inquiry is set on foot and the alarm\r\nincreases; people in a strange uniform have been seen passing on their\r\nway to the chateau of Villiers; from thence, on reaching the number of\r\ntwo hundred, they will go and join the garrison of Besançon; they will\r\ntravel four at a time in order to avoid detection. At Besançon they are\r\nto meet a corps of forty thousand men, commanded by M. Autichamp, which\r\ncorps is to march on to Paris to carry off the King, and break up the\r\nNational Assembly. The National Guards along the whole route are to\r\nbe forced into the lines. At a certain distance each man is to receive\r\n1,200 francs, and, at the end of the expedition, is to be enrolled\r\nin the Artois Guard, or sent home with a recompense of 12,000\r\nfrancs.--Meanwhile, the Prince de Condé; with forty thousand men, will\r\ncome by the way of Pont Saint-Esprit in Languedoc, rally the disaffected\r\nof Carpentras and of the Jalès camp to his standard, and occupy Cette\r\nand the other seaports; and finally, the Comte d'Artois, on his side,\r\nwill enter by Pont-Beauvoisin with thirty thousand men.--A horrible\r\ndiscovery! The municipal authorities of Valence immediately inform those\r\nof Lyons, Besançon, Châlons, Maçon, and others beside. On the strength\r\nof this the municipal body of Maçon, \"considering that the enemies of\r\nthe Revolution are ever making the most strenuous efforts to annihilate\r\nthe Constitution which secures the happiness of this empire,\" and \"that\r\nit is highly important to frustrate their designs,\" sends two hundred\r\nmen of its National Guard to the chateau of Villiers,\" empowered to\r\nemploy armed force in case of resistance.\" For greater security,\r\nthis troop is joined by the National Guards of the three neighboring\r\nparishes. M. de Bussy, on being told that they were climbing over the\r\nwall into his garden, seizes a gun and takes aim, but does not fire, and\r\nthen, the requisition being legal, throws all open to them. There are\r\nfound in the house six green coats, seven dozens of large buttons, and\r\nfifteen dozens of small ones. The proof is manifest. He explains what\r\nhis project was and states his motive--it is a mere pretext. He makes a\r\nsign, as an order, to his valet--there is a positive complicity. M. de\r\nBussy, his six guests, and the valet, are arrested and transported to\r\nMaçon. A trial takes place, with depositions and interrogatories, in\r\nwhich the truth is elicited in spite of the most adverse testimony;\r\nit is clear that M. de Bussy never intended to do more than defend\r\nhimself.--But prejudice is a blindfold to hostile eyes. It cannot be\r\nadmitted that, under a constitution which is perfect, an innocent man\r\ncould incur danger; the objection is made to him that \"it is not natural\r\nfor an armed company to be formed to resist a massacre by which it is\r\nnot menaced;\" they are convinced beforehand that he is guilty. On a\r\ndecree of the National Assembly the minister had ordered all accused\r\npersons to be brought to Paris by the constabulary and hussars; the\r\nNational Guard of Maçon, \"in the greatest state of agitation,\" declares\r\nthat, \"as it had arrested M. de Bussy, it would not consent to his\r\ntransport by any other body. . . Undoubtedly, the object is to allow him\r\nto escape on the way,\" but it will know how to keep its captive secure.\r\nThe guard, in fine, of its own authority, escorts M. de Bussy to Paris,\r\ninto the Abbaye prison, where he is kept confined for several months--so\r\nlong, indeed, that, after a new trial and investigation, the absurdity\r\nof the accusation being too palpable, they are obliged to set him at\r\nliberty.--Such is the situation of most of the gentry on their own\r\nestates, and M. de Bussy, even acquitted and vindicated, will act wisely\r\nin not returning home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--Domiciliary visits.\r\n\r\n     The fifth jacquerie.--Burgundy and Lyonnais in 1791.--M. de\r\n     Chaponay and M. Guillin-Dumoutet\r\n\r\nHe would be nothing but a hostage there. Alone against thousands, sole\r\nsurvivor and representative of an abolished régime which all detest,\r\nit is the noble against whom everybody turns whenever a political shock\r\nseems to shake the new régime. He is at least disarmed, as he might\r\nbe dangerous, and, in these popular executions, brutal instincts and\r\nappetites break loose like a bull that dashes through a door and rages\r\nthrough a dwelling-house. In the same department, some months later,\r\non the news arriving of the arrest of the King at Varennes, \"all\r\nnonjuring[3313] priests and ci-devant nobles are exposed to the horrors\r\nof persecution.\" Bands forcibly enter houses to seize arms: Commarin,\r\nGrosbois, Montculot, Chaudenay, Créancé, Toisy, Chatellenot, and other\r\nhouses are thus visited, and several are sacked. During the night\r\nof June 26-27, 1791, at the chateau of Créancé \"there is pillaging\r\nthroughout; the mirrors are broken, the pictures are torn up, and the\r\ndoors are broken down.\" The master of the house, \"M. de Comeau-Créncé,\r\nKnight of St. Louis, horribly maltreated, is dragged to the foot of the\r\nstairs, where he lies as if dead:\" previous to this, \"he was forced to\r\ngive a considerable contribution, and to refund all penalties collected\r\nby him before the Revolution as the local lord of the manor. \"--Two\r\nother proprietors in the neighborhood, both Knights of St. Louis, are\r\ntreated in the same way. \"That is the way in which three old and brave\r\nsoldiers are rewarded for their services!\" A fourth, a peaceable man,\r\nescapes beforehand, leaving his keys in the locks and his gardener in\r\nthe house. Notwithstanding this, the doors and the clothes-presses were\r\nbroken open, the pillaging lasting five hours and a half; with\r\nthreats of setting the house on fire if the seigneur did not make his\r\nappearance. Questions were asked \"as to whether he attended the mass of\r\nthe new curé whether he had formerly exacted fines, and finally, whether\r\nany of the inhabitants had any complaint to make against him.\" No\r\ncomplaint is made; on the contrary, he is rather beloved.--But, in\r\ntumults of this sort, a hundred madmen and fifty rogues prescribe the\r\nlaw to the timid and the indifferent. These outlaws declared that \"they\r\nwere acting under orders; they compelled the mayor and prosecuting\r\nattorney to take part in their robberies; they likewise took the\r\nprecaution to force a few honest citizens, by using the severest\r\nthreats, to march along with them.\" These people come the next day to\r\napologize to the pillaged proprietor, while the municipal officers draw\r\nup a statement of the violence practiced against them. The violence\r\nnevertheless, is accomplished, and, as it will go unpunished, it is soon\r\nto be repeated.\r\n\r\nA beginning and an end are already made in the two neighboring\r\ndepartments. There, especially in the south, nothing is more instructive\r\nthan to see how an outbreak stimulated by enthusiasm for the public good\r\nimmediately degenerates under the impulse of private interest, and ends\r\nin crime.--Around Lyons,[3314] under the same pretext and at the same\r\ndate, similar mobs perform similar visitations, and, on all these\r\noccasions, \"the rent-rolls are burnt, and houses are pillaged and set on\r\nfire. Municipal authority, organized for the security of property, is in\r\nmany hands but one facility more for its violation. The National\r\nGuard seems to be armed merely for the protection of robbery and\r\ndisorder.\"--For more than thirty years, M. de Chaponay, the father of\r\nsix children of whom three are in the service, expended his vast income\r\non his estate of Beaulieu, giving occupation to a number of persons,\r\nmen, women, and children. After the hailstorm of 1761, which nearly\r\ndestroyed the village of Moranée, he rebuilt thirty-three houses,\r\nfurnished others with timber for the framework, supplied the commune\r\nwith wheat, and, for several years, obtained for the inhabitants a\r\ndiminution of their taxation. In 1790, he celebrated the Federation\r\nFestival on a magnificent scale, giving two banquets, one of a hundred\r\nand thirty seats, for the municipal bodies and officers of the National\r\nGuards in the vicinity, and the other of a thousand seats for the\r\nprivates. If any of the gentry had reason to believe himself popular\r\nand safe it was certainly this man.--On the 24th of June, 1791, the\r\nmunicipal authorities of Moranée, Lucenay, and Chazelai, with their\r\nmayors and National Guards, in all nearly two thousand men, arrive at\r\nthe chateau with drums beating and flags flying. M. de Chaponay goes out\r\nto meet them, and begs to know to what he owes \"the pleasure\" of their\r\nvisit. They reply that they do not come to offend him, but to carry out\r\nthe orders of the district, which oblige them to take possession of the\r\nchateau and to place in it a guard of sixty men: on the following day\r\nthe \"district\" and the National Guard of Villefranche are to come and\r\ninspect it.--Be it noted that these orders are imaginary, for M. de\r\nChaponay asks in vain to see them; they cannot be produced. The cause of\r\ntheir setting out, probably, is the false rumor that the National Guard\r\nof Villefranche is coming to deprive them of a booty on which they had\r\ncalculated.--Nevertheless M. de Chaponay submits; he merely requests\r\nthe municipal officers to make the search themselves and in an orderly\r\nmanner. Upon this the commandant of the National Guard of Lucenay\r\nexclaims, with some irritation, that \"all are equal and all must go\r\nin,\" and at the same moment all rush forward. \"M. de Chaponay orders the\r\napartments to be opened; they immediately shut them up, purposely to\r\nlet the sappers break through the doors with their axes.\"--Everything is\r\npillaged, \"plate, assignats, stocks of linen, laces and other articles;\r\nthe trees of the avenues are hacked and mutilated; the cellars are\r\nemptied, the casks are rolled out on the terrace, the wine is suffered\r\nto run out, and the chateau keep is demolished. . . . The officers urge\r\non those that are laggard.\" Towards nine o'clock in the evening M. de\r\nChaponay is informed by his servants that the municipal authorities have\r\ndetermined upon forcing him to sign an abandonment of his feudal dues\r\nand afterwards beheading him. He escapes with his wife through the only\r\ndoor which is left unguarded, wanders about all night, exposed to the\r\ngun-shots of the squads which are on his track, and reaches Lyons only\r\non the following day.--Meanwhile the pillagers send him notice that if\r\nhe does not abandon his rentals, they will cut down his forests and\r\nburn up everything on his estate. The chateau, indeed, is fired three\r\ndistinct times, while, in the interval, the band sack another chateau at\r\nBayère, and, on again passing by that of M. de Chaponay, demolish a\r\ndam which had cost 10,000 livres.--The public prosecutor, for his part,\r\nremains quiet, notwithstanding the appeals to him: he doubtless says to\r\nhimself that a gentleman whose house has been searched is lucky to have\r\nsaved his life, and that others, like M. Guillin-Dumoutet, for example,\r\nhave not been as fortunate.\r\n\r\nThe latter gentleman, formerly captain of a vessel belonging to the\r\nIndia Company, afterwards Commandant at Senegal, now retired from active\r\nlife, occupied his chateau of Poleymieux with his young wife and two\r\ninfant children, his sisters, nieces, and sister-in-law--in all, ten\r\nwomen belonging to his family and domestic service--one Negro servant\r\nand himself; an old man of sixty years of age; here is a haunt of\r\nmilitant conspirators which must be disarmed as soon as possible.[3315]\r\nUnfortunately, a brother of M. Guillin, accused of treason to the\r\nnation, had been arrested ten months previously, which was quite\r\nsufficient for the clubs in the neighborhood. In the month of December,\r\n1790, the chateau had already been ransacked by the people of the\r\nparishes in the vicinity: nothing was found, and the Department first\r\ncensured and afterwards interdicted these arbitrary searches. On this\r\noccasion they will manage things better.--On the 26th of June, 1791, at\r\nten o'clock in the morning, the municipal body of Poleymicux, along with\r\ntwo other bodies in their scarves, and three hundred National Guards,\r\nare seen approaching, under the usual pretext of searching for arms.\r\nMadame Guillin presents herself; reminds them of the interdict of the\r\nDepartment, and demands the legal order under which they act. They\r\nrefuse to give it. M. Guillin descends in his turn and offers to open\r\nhis doors to them if they will produce the order. They have no order\r\nto show him. During the colloquy a certain man named Rosier, a former\r\nsoldier who had deserted twice, and who is now in command of the\r\nNational Guard, seizes M. Guillin by the throat; the old captain defends\r\nhimself; presents a pistol at the man, which misses fire, and then,\r\nthrowing the fellow off, withdraws into the house, closing the door\r\nbehind him.--Soon after this, the tocsin sounds in the neighborhood,\r\nthirty parishes start up, and two thousand men arrive. Madame Guillin,\r\nby entreaties, succeeds in having delegates appointed, chosen by the\r\ncrowd, to inspect the chateau. These delegates examine the apartments,\r\nand declare that they can find nothing but the arms ordinarily kept on\r\nhand. This declaration is of no effect: the multitude, whose excitement\r\nis increased by waiting, feel their strength, and have no idea of\r\nreturning empty-handed. A volley is fired, and the chateau windows\r\nare riddled with balls. As a last effort Madame Guillin, with her two\r\nchildren in her arms, comes out, and going to the municipal officers,\r\ncalls upon them to do their duty. Far from doing this they retain her\r\nas a hostage, and place her in such a position that, if there is firing\r\nfrom the chateau, she may receive the bullets. Meanwhile, the doors are\r\nforced, the house is pillaged from top to bottom, and then set on fire;\r\nM. Guillin, who seeks refuge in the keep, is almost reached by the\r\nflames. At this moment, some of the assailants, less ferocious than\r\nthe rest, prevail upon him to descend, and they answer for his life.\r\nScarcely has he shown himself when others fall on him; they cry that he\r\nmust be killed, that he has a life-rent of 36,000 francs from the State,\r\nand \"this will be so much saved for the nation.\" \"He is hacked to pieces\r\nalive;\" his head is cut off and borne upon a pike; his body is cut up,\r\nand sent piece by piece to each parish; several wash their hands in his\r\nblood, and besmear their faces with it. It seems as if tumult, clamor,\r\nincendiarism, robbery, and murder had aroused in them not only the cruel\r\ninstincts of the savage, but the carnivorous appetites of the brute;\r\nsome of them, seized by the gendarmerie at Chasselay, had roasted the\r\ndead man's arm and dined upon it.[3316]--Madame Guillin, who is saved\r\nthrough the compassion of two of the inhabitants of the place, succeeds,\r\nafter encountering many dangers, in reaching Lyons; she and her children\r\nlost everything, \"the chateau, its dependencies, the crop of the\r\npreceding year, wine, grain, furniture, plate, ready money, assignats,\r\nnotes, and contracts.\" Ten days later, the department gives notice to\r\nthe National Assembly that \"similar projects are still being plotted and\r\narranged, and that there are (always) threats of burning chateaux and\r\nrent-rolls;\" that no doubt of this can possibly exist: \"the inhabitants\r\nof the country only await the opportunity, to renew these scenes of\r\nhorror.\"[3317]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--The nobles obliged to leave the rural districts.\r\n\r\n     They take refuge in towns.--The dangers they incur.--The\r\n     eighty-two gentlemen of Caen\r\n\r\nAmidst these multiplied and reviving Jacqueries there is nothing left\r\nbut flight, and the nobles, driven out of the rural districts, seek\r\nrefuge in the towns. But here also a jacquerie awaits them. As the\r\neffects of the Constitution are developed, successive administrations\r\nbecome feebler and more partial; the unbridled populace has become\r\nmore excitable and more violent; the enthroned club has become more\r\nsuspicious and more despotic. Henceforth the club, through or in\r\nopposition to the administrative bodies, leads the populace, and the\r\nnobles will find it as hostile as the peasants. All their reunions,\r\neven when liberal, are closed like that in Paris, through the illegal\r\ninterference of mobs, or through the iniquitous action of the popular\r\nmagistrates. All their associations, even when legal and salutary, are\r\nbroken up by brute force or by municipal intolerance, They are punished\r\nfor having thought of defending themselves, and slaughtered because they\r\ntry to avoid assassination.--Three or four hundred gentlemen, who\r\nwere threatened on their estates, sought refuge with their families in\r\nCaen;[3318] and they trusted to find one there, for, by three different\r\nresolutions, the municipal body promised them aid and protection.\r\nUnfortunately, the club thinks otherwise, and, on August 23, 1791,\r\nprints and posts up a list of their names and residences, declaring that\r\nsince \"their suspected opinions have compelled them to abandon the rural\r\ndistricts,\" they are emigrants in the interior;\" from which it follows\r\nthat \"their conduct must be scrupulously watched,\" because \"it may be\r\nthe effect of some dangerous plot against the country.\" Fifteen are\r\nespecially designated; among others \"the former curé of Saint-Loup, the\r\ngreat bloodhound of the aristocrats, and all of them very suspicious\r\npersons, harboring the worst intentions.\"--Thus denounced and singled\r\nout, it is evident that they can no longer sleep peacefully: moreover,\r\nnow that their addresses are published, they are openly threatened with\r\ndomiciliary visits and violence. As to the administrative authorities,\r\ntheir intervention cannot be expected on; the department itself gives\r\nnotice to the minister that, as the law stands, it cannot put the\r\nchateau in the hands of the regulars,[3319] as this would, it is said,\r\nexcite the National Guard. Besides, how without an army is this post to\r\nbe wrested from the hands which hold it? It is impossible with only the\r\nresources which the Constitution affords us.\" Thus, in the defense of\r\nthe oppressed, the Constitution is a dead letter.--Hence it is that the\r\nrefugees, finding protection only in themselves, undertake to help\r\neach other. No association can be more justifiable, more pacific, more\r\ninnocent. Its object is \"to demand the execution of the laws constantly\r\nviolated, and to protect persons and property.\" In each quarter they\r\nwill try to bring together \"all good citizens;\" they will form a\r\ncommittee of eight members, and, in each committee, there will always\r\nbe \"an officer of justice or a member of the administrative body with\r\nan officer or subaltern of the National Guard.\" Should any citizen be\r\nattacked in person or property the association will draw up a petition\r\nin his favor. Should any particular act of violence require the\r\nemployment of public force, the members of the district will assemble\r\nunder the orders of the officer of justice and of the National Guard\r\nto enforce obedience. \"In all possible cases\" they \"will avoid with the\r\ngreatest care any insult of individuals; they will consider that\r\nthe object of the meeting is solely to ensure public peace, and that\r\nprotection from the law to which every citizen is entitled.\"--In short,\r\nthey are volunteer constables. Turn the inquiry which way they will,\r\na hostile municipality and a prejudiced tribunal can put no other\r\nconstruction upon it; they find nothing else. The only evidence against\r\none of the leaders is a letter in which he tries to prevent a gentleman\r\nfrom going to Coblentz, striving to prove to him that he will be more\r\nuseful at Caen. The principal evidence against the association is that\r\nof a townsman whom they wished to enroll, and of whom they demanded his\r\nopinions. He had stated that he was in favor of the execution of the\r\nlaws; upon which they told him: \"In this case you belong to us, and\r\nare more of an aristocrat than you think you are. Their aristocracy, in\r\neffect, consists wholly in the suppression of brigandage. No claim is\r\nmore unpalatable, because it interposes an obstacle to the arbitrary\r\nacts of a party which thinks it has a right to do as it pleases. On\r\nthe 4th of October the regiment of Aunis left the town, and all good\r\ncitizens were handed over to the militia, \"in uniform or not,\" they\r\nalone being armed. That day, for the first time in a long period, M.\r\nBunel, the former curé of Saint-Jean, with the consent and assistance of\r\nhis sworn successor, officiates at the mass. There is a large gathering\r\nof the orthodox, which causes uneasiness among the patriots. The\r\nfollowing day M. Bunel is to say mass again; whereupon, through the\r\nmunicipal authorities, the patriots forbid him to officiate, to which he\r\nsubmits. Nevertheless, for lack of due notice, a crowd of the faithful\r\nhave arrived and the church is filled. A dangerous mob! The patriots\r\nand National Guards arrive \"to preserve order,\" which has not been\r\ndisturbed, and which they alone disturb. Threatening words are exchanged\r\nbetween the servants of the nobles and the National Guard. The latter\r\ndraw their swords, and a young man is hewn down and trampled on; M. de\r\nSaffrey, who comes to his assistance unarmed, is himself cut down and\r\npierced with bayonets, and two others are wounded.--Meanwhile, in a\r\nneighboring street, M. Achard de Vagogne, seeing a man maltreated by\r\narmed men, approaches, in order to make peace. The man is shot down\r\nand M. Achard is covered with saber and bayonet gashes: \"there is not a\r\nthread on him which is not dyed with the blood that ran down even into\r\nhis shoes.\" In this condition he is led to the chateau along with M. de\r\nSaifrey. Others break down the door of the house of M. du Rosel, an old\r\nofficer of seventy-five years, of which fifty-nine have been passed in\r\nthe service, and pursue him even over the wall of his garden. A fourth\r\nsquad seizes M. d'Héricy, another venerable officer, who, like M. du\r\nRosel, was ignorant of all that was going on, and was quietly leaving\r\nfor his country seat.--The town is full of tumult, and, through the\r\norders of the municipal authorities, the general alarm is sounded.\r\n\r\nThe time for the special constables to act has come; about sixty\r\ngentlemen, with a number of merchants and artisans, set out. According\r\nto the rules of their association, and with significant scruple, they\r\nbeg an Officer of the National Guard, who happens to be passing, to put\r\nhimself at their head; they reach the Place Saint-Sauveur, encounter the\r\nsuperior officer sent after them by the municipal authorities, and, at\r\nhis first command, follow him to the Hôtel-de-Ville. On reaching this,\r\nwithout any resistance on their part, they are arrested, disarmed, and\r\nsearched. The rules and regulations of their league are found on their\r\npersons; they are evidently hatching a counter-revolution. The uproar\r\nagainst them is terrible. \"To keep them safe,\" they are conducted to the\r\nchateau, while many of them are cruelly treated on the way by the\r\ncrowd. Others, seized in their houses--M. Levaillant and a servant of M.\r\nd'Héricy--are carried off bleeding and pierced with bayonets. Eighty-two\r\nprisoners are thus collected, while fears are constantly entertained\r\nthat they may escape. \"Their bread and meat are cut up into little\r\npieces, to see that nothing is concealed therein; the surgeons, who are\r\nlikewise treated as aristocrats, are denied access to them.\" Nocturnal\r\nvisits are, at the same time, paid to their houses; every stranger is\r\nordered to present himself at the Hôtel-de-Ville, to state why he comes\r\nto the town to reside, and to give up his arms; every nonjuring priest\r\nis forbidden to say mass. The Department, which is disposed to resist,\r\nhas its hands tied and confesses its powerlessness. \"The people,\" it\r\nwrites, \"know their strength: they know that we have no power; excited\r\nby disreputable citizens, they permit whatever serves their passions or\r\ntheir interests; they influence our deliberations, and force us to those\r\nwhich, under other circumstances, we should carefully avoid.\"--Three\r\ndays after this the victors celebrate their triumph \"with drums, music,\r\nand lighted torches; the people are using hammers to destroy on the\r\nmansions the coats-of-arms which had previously been covered over with\r\nplaster;\" the defeat of the aristocrats is accomplished.--And yet their\r\ninnocence is so clearly manifest that the Legislative Assembly itself\r\ncannot help recognizing it. After eleven weeks of durance the order is\r\ngiven to set them free, with the exception of two, a youth of less\r\nthan eighteen years and an old man, almost an octogenarian, on whom two\r\nletters, misunderstood, still leave a shadow of suspicion.--But it is\r\nnot certain that the people are disposed to give them up. The National\r\nGuard refuses to discharge them in open daylight and serve as their\r\nescort. Even the evening before numerous groups of women, a few men\r\nmingled with them, talk of murdering all those fellows the moment they\r\nset foot outside the chateau.\" They have to be let out at two o'clock\r\nin the morning, secretly, under a strong guard, and to leave the town\r\nat once as six months before they left the rural districts.--Neither in\r\ncountry nor in the town[3320] are they under the protection of civil\r\nor religious law; a gentleman, who is not compromised in the affair,\r\nremarks that their situation is worse than that of Protestants and\r\nvagabonds during the worst years of the Ancient Régime of them and who\r\nabuse the use of them? Why should one be on an equality for purposes of\r\npayment, and distinguished?\r\n\r\n\"Does not the law allow (nonjuring) priests the liberty of saying mass?\r\nWhy then can we not listen to their mass except at the risk of our\r\nlives? Does not the law command all citizens to preserve the public\r\npeace? Why then are those whom the cry to arms has summoned forth to\r\nmaintain public order assailed as aristocrats? Why is the refuge of\r\ncitizens which the laws have declared sacred, violated without orders,\r\nwithout accusation, without any appearance of wrong-doing? Why are all\r\nprominent citizens and those who are well off disarmed in preference to\r\nothers? Are weapons exclusively made for those but lately deprived only\r\nfor purposes of annoyance and insult?\"\r\n\r\nHe has spoken right. Those who now rule form an aristocracy in\r\nan inverse sense, contrary to the law, and yet more contrary to\r\nnature.[3321] For, by a violent inversion, the lower grades in the\r\ngraduated scale of civilization and culture now are found uppermost,\r\nwhile the superior grades are found at the uniform. The Constitution\r\nhaving suppressed inequality, this has again arisen in an inverse sense.\r\nThe populace, both of town and country, taxes, imprisons, pillages, and\r\nslays more arbitrarily, more brutally, more unjustly than feudal barons,\r\nand for its serfs or villains it has its ancient chieftains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--Persecutions in private life.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that, in order not to excite suspicion, they are\r\ncontent to be without arms, to form no more associations, not to attend\r\nelections, to shut themselves up at home, to strictly confine themselves\r\nwithin the harmless precincts of domestic life. The same distrust, the\r\nsame animosity, still pursues them there.--At Cahors,[3322] where\r\nthe municipal authorities, in spite of the law, had just expelled the\r\nCarthusians who, under legal sanction, chose to remain and live\r\nin common, two of the monks, before their departure, give to M. de\r\nBeaumont, their friend and neighbor, four dwarf pear-trees and some\r\nonions in blossom in their garden. On the strength of this, the\r\nmunicipal body decree that\r\n\r\n\"the sieur Louis de Beaumont, formerly count, is guilty of having\r\naudaciously and maliciously damaged national property,\" condemns him\r\nto pay a fine of three hundred livres, and orders \"that the four\r\npear-trees, pulled up in the so-called Carthusian garden, be brought on\r\nthe following day, Wednesday, to the door of the said sieur de Beaumont,\r\nand there remain for four consecutive days, guarded, day and night, by\r\ntwo fusiliers, at the expense of the said sieur de Beaumont; and upon\r\nthe said trees shall be placed the following inscription, to wit:\r\nLouis de Beaumont, destroyer of the national property. And the judgment\r\nherewith rendered shall be printed to the number of one thousand\r\ncopies, read, published, and posted at the expense of the said sieur\r\nde Beaumont, and duly addressed throughout the department of Lot to the\r\ndistricts and municipalities thereof, as well as to all societies of the\r\nFriends of the Constitution and of Liberty.\"\r\n\r\nEvery line of this legal invective discloses the malignant envy of\r\nthe local recorder, who revenges himself for having formerly bowed too\r\nlow.--The following year, M. de Beaumont, having formally and under\r\nnotarial sanction bought a church which was sold by the district, along\r\nwith the ornaments and objects of worship it contained, the mayor and\r\nmunicipal officers, followed by a lot of workmen, come and carry away\r\nand destroy everything--confessionals, altars, and even the saint's\r\ncanonised body, which had been interred for one hundred and fifty years:\r\nso that, after their departure, \"the edifice resembled a vast barn\r\nfilled with ruins and rubbish.\"[3323] It must be noted that, at this\r\nvery time, M. de Beaumont is military commandant at Perigord. The\r\ntreatment he undergoes shows what is in reserve for ordinary nobles. I\r\ndo not recommend them to attend official sales of property.[3324]--Will\r\nthey even be free in their domestic enjoyments, and on entering a\r\ndrawing-room are they sure of quietly passing an evening there?--At\r\nParis, even, a number of persons of rank, among them the ambassadors\r\nof Denmark and Venice, are listening to a concert in a mansion in the\r\nFaubourg Saint-Honoré given by a foreign virtuoso, when a cart enters\r\nthe court loaded with fifty bundles of hay, the monthly supply for the\r\nhorses. A patriot, who sees the cart driven in, imagines that the King\r\nis concealed underneath the hay, and that he has come there for the\r\npurpose of plotting with the aristocrats about his flight. A mob\r\ngathers, and the National Guard arrives, along with a commissioner,\r\nwhile four grenadiers stand guard around the cart. The commissioner,\r\nin the meantime, inspects the hotel; he sees music-stands, and the\r\narrangements for a supper; comes back, has the cart unloaded, and states\r\nto the people that he has found nothing suspicious. The people do not\r\nbelieve him, and demand a second inspection. This is made by twenty-four\r\ndelegates; the bundles of hay, moreover, are counted, and several of\r\nthem are unbound, but all in vain. Disappointed and irritated, having\r\nanticipated a spectacle, the crowd insists that all the invited guests,\r\nmen and women, should leave the house on foot, and only get into\r\ntheir carriages at the end of the street. \"First comes a file of empty\r\ncarriages;\" next, \"all the guests in their evening attire, and the\r\nladies in full dress, trembling with fear, with downcast eyes, between\r\ntwo rows of men, women, and children, who stare them in the face, and\r\noverwhelm them with insults.\"[3325]\r\n\r\nSuspected of holding secret meetings, and called to account in his own\r\nhouse, has the noble at least the right to frequent a public saloon,\r\nto eat in a restaurant, and to take the fresh air in a balcony?--The\r\nVicomte de Mirabeau, who has just dined in the Palais-Royal, stands at\r\nthe window to take the air, and is recognized; there is a\r\ngathering, and the cry is soon heard, \"Down with Mirabeau-Tonneau\r\n(barrel-Mirabeau)!\"[3326] \"Gravel is flung at him from all sides, and\r\noccasionally stones. One of the window-panes is broken by a stone.\r\nImmediately picking up the stone, he shows it to the crowd, and, at\r\nthe same time, quietly places it on the sill of the window, in token of\r\nmoderation.\" There is a loud outcry; his friends force him to withdraw\r\ninside, and Bailly, the mayor, comes in person to quiet the aggressors.\r\nIn this case there are good reasons for their hatred. The gentleman\r\nwhom they stone is a bon-vivant, large and fat, fond of rich epicurean\r\nSuppers; and on this account the populace imagine him to be a monster,\r\nand even worse, an ogre. With regard to these nobles, whose greatest\r\nmisfortune is to be over-polished and too worldly, the over-excited\r\nimagination revives its old nursery tales.--M. de Montlosier, living in\r\nthe Rue Richelieu, finds that he is watched on his way to the National\r\nAssembly. One woman especially, from thirty to thirty-two years of age,\r\nwho sold meat at a stall in the Passage Saint-Guillaume, \"regarded him\r\nwith special attention. As soon as she saw him coming she took up a\r\nlong, broad knife which she sharpened before him, casting furious looks\r\nat him.\" He asks his housekeeper what this means. Two children of that\r\nquarter have disappeared, carried off by gipsies, and the report is\r\ncurrent that M. de Montlosier, the Marquis de Mirabeau, and other\r\ndeputies of the \"right,\" meet together \"to hold orgies in which they eat\r\nlittle children.\"\r\n\r\nIn this state of public opinion there is no crime which is not imputed\r\nto them, no insult which is not freely bestowed on them. \"Traitors,\r\ntyrants, conspirators, assassins,\" such is the current vocabulary of\r\nthe clubs and newspapers in relation to them. \"Aristocrat\" signifies\r\nall this, and whoever dares to refute the calumny is himself an\r\naristocrat.--At the Palais-Royal, it is constantly repeated that M. de\r\nCastries, in his last duel, made use of a poisoned sword, and an officer\r\nof the navy who protests against this false report is himself accused,\r\ntried on the spot, and condemned \"to be shut up in the guard-house or\r\nthrown into the fountain.\"[3327]--The nobles must beware of defending\r\ntheir honor in the usual way and of meeting an insult with a challenge!\r\nAt Castelnau, near Cahors,[3328] one of those who, the preceding year,\r\nmarched against the incendiaries, M. de Bellud, Knight of Saint-Louis,\r\non coming down the public square with his brother, a guardsman, is\r\ngreeted with cries of \"The aristocrat! to the lamp post!\" His brother is\r\nin a morning coat and slippers, and not wishing to get into trouble they\r\ndo not reply. A squad of the National Guard, passing by, repeats the\r\ncry, but they still remain silent. The shout continues, and M. de\r\nBellud, after some time has elapsed, begs the captain to order his men\r\nto be quiet. He refuses, and M. de Bellud demands satisfaction outside\r\nthe town. At these words the National Guards rush at M. de Bellud with\r\nfixed bayonets. His brother receives a saber-cut on the neck, while he,\r\ndefending himself with his sword, slightly wounds the captain and one\r\nof the men. The two brothers, alone against the whole body, fight on,\r\nretreating to their house, in which they are blockaded. Towards seven\r\no'clock in the evening, two or three hundred National Guards from\r\nCahors arrive to reinforce the besiegers. The house is taken, and\r\nthe guardsman, escaping across the fields, sprains his ankle and is\r\ncaptured. M. de Bellud, who has found his way into another house,\r\ncontinues to defend himself there: the house is set on fire and burnt,\r\ntogether with two others alongside of it. Taking refuge in a cellar he\r\nstill keeps on firing. Bundles of lighted straw are thrown in at the\r\nair-holes. Almost suffocated, he springs out, kills his first assailant\r\nwith a shot from one pistol, and himself with another. His head is cut\r\noff with that of his servant. The guardsman is made to kiss the two\r\nheads, and, on his demanding a glass of water, they fill his mouth\r\nwith the blood which drops from the severed head of his brother. The\r\nvictorious gang then set out for Cahors, with the two heads stuck on\r\nbayonets, and the guardsman in a cart. It comes to a halt before a house\r\nin which a literary circle meets, suspected by the Jacobin club. The\r\nwounded man is made to descend from the cart and is hung: his body is\r\nriddled with balls, and everything the house contains is broken up,\r\n\"the furniture is thrown out of the windows, and the house pulled\r\ndown.\"--Every popular execution is of this character, at once prompt and\r\ncomplete, similar to those of an Oriental monarch who, on the instant,\r\nwithout inquiry or trial, avenges his offended majesty, and for\r\nevery offense, knows no other punishment than death. At Tulle, M. de\r\nMassy,[3329] lieutenant of the \"Royal Navarre,\" having struck a man that\r\ninsulted him, is seized in the house in which he took refuge, and, in\r\nspite of the three administrative bodies, is at once massacred.--At\r\nBrest, two anti-revolutionary caricatures having been drawn with\r\ncharcoal on the walls of the military coffee-house, the excited crowd\r\nlay the blame of it on the officers; one of these, M. Patry, takes it\r\nupon himself, and, on the point of being torn to pieces, attempts to\r\nkill himself. He is disarmed, but, when the municipal authorities come\r\nto his assistance, they find him \"already dead through an infinite\r\nnumber of wounds,\" and his head is borne about on the end of a\r\npike.[3330]--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--Conduct of officers.\r\n\r\n     Their self-sacrifice.--Disposition of the soldiery.\r\n     --Military outbreaks.--Spread and increase of\r\n     insubordination.--Resignation of the officers.\r\n\r\nMuch better would it be to live under an Eastern king, for he is not\r\nfound everywhere, nor always furious and mad, like the populace. Nowhere\r\nare the nobles safe, neither in public nor in private life, neither in\r\nthe country nor in the towns, neither associated together nor separate.\r\nPopular hostility hangs over them like a dark and threatening cloud from\r\none end of the territory to the other, and the tempest bursts upon them\r\nin a continuous storm of vexations, outrages, calumnies, robberies, and\r\nacts of violence; here, there, and almost daily, bloody thunderbolts\r\nfall haphazard on the most inoffensive heads, on an old man asleep, on a\r\nKnight of Saint-Louis taking a walk, on a family at prayers in a church.\r\nBut, in this aristocracy, crushed down in some places and attacked\r\neverywhere, the thunderbolt finds one predestined group which attracts\r\nit and on which it constantly falls, and that is the corps of officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--Conduct of the officers.\r\n\r\n     Their self-sacrifice.--Disposition of the soldiery.\r\n     --Military outbreaks.--Spread and increase of\r\n     insubordination.--Resignation of the officers.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few fops, frequenters of drawing-rooms, and the\r\ncourt favorites who have reached a high rank through the intrigues of\r\nthe antechamber, it was in this group, especially in the medium ranks,\r\nthat true moral nobility was then found. Nowhere in France was there so\r\nmuch tried, substantial merit. A man of genius, who associated with\r\nthem in his youth, rendered them this homage: many among them are\r\nmen possessing \"the most amiable characters and minds of the highest\r\norder.\"[3331] Indeed, for most of them, military service was not a\r\ncareer of ambition, but an obligation of birth. It was the rule in each\r\nnoble family for the eldest son to enter the army, and advancement was\r\nof but little consequence. He discharged the debt of his rank; this\r\nsufficed for him, and, after twenty or thirty years of service, the\r\norder of Saint-Louis, and sometimes a meager pension, were all he had\r\na right to expect. Amongst nine or ten thousand officers, the great\r\nmajority coming from the lower and poorer class of provincial nobles,\r\nbody-guards, lieutenants, captains, majors, lieutenant-colonels, and\r\neven colonels, have no other pretension. Satisfied with favors[3332]\r\nrestricted to their subordinate rank, they leave the highest grades of\r\nthe service to the heirs of the great families, to the courtiers or to\r\nthe parvenus at Versailles, and content themselves with remaining the\r\nguardians of public order, and the brave defenders of the State. Under\r\nthis system, when the heart is not depraved it becomes exalted; it is\r\nmade a point of honor to serve without compensation; there is nothing\r\nbut the public welfare in view, and all the more because, at this\r\nmoment, it is the absorbing topic of all minds and of all literature.\r\nNowhere has practical philosophy, that which consists in a spirit\r\nof abnegation, more deeply penetrated than among this unrecognized\r\nnobility. Under a polished, brilliant, and sometimes frivolous exterior,\r\nthey have a serious soul; the old sentiment of honor is converted\r\ninto one of patriotism. Set to execute the laws, with force in hand to\r\nmaintain peace through fear, they feel the importance of their mission,\r\nand, for two years, fulfill its duties with extraordinary moderation,\r\ngentleness, and patience, not only at the risk of their lives, but\r\namidst great and multiplied humiliations, through the sacrifice of their\r\nauthority and self-esteem, through the subjection of their intelligent\r\nwill to the dictation and incapacity of the masters imposed upon them.\r\nFor a noble officer to respond to the requisitions of an extemporized\r\nbourgeois municipal body,[3333] to subordinate his competence, courage,\r\nand prudence to the blunders and alarms of five or six inexperienced,\r\nfrightened, and timid attorneys, to place his energy and daring at the\r\nservice of their presumption, feebleness, and lack of decision,\r\neven when their orders or refusal of orders are manifestly absurd or\r\ninjurious, even when they are opposed to the previous instructions of\r\nhis general or of his minister, even when they end in the plundering\r\nof a market, the burning of a chateau, the assassination of an innocent\r\nperson, even when they impose upon him the obligation of witnessing\r\ncrime with his sword sheathed and arms folded,[3334]--this is a hard\r\ntask. It is hard for the noble officer to see independent, popular, and\r\nbourgeois troops organized in the face of his own troops, rivals and\r\neven hostile, in any case ten times as numerous and no less exacting\r\nthan sensitive--hard to be expected to show them deference and extend\r\ncivilities to them, to surrender to them posts, arsenals, and citadels,\r\nto treat their chiefs as equals, however ignorant or unworthy, and\r\nwhatever they may be--here a lawyer, there a Capuchin, elsewhere a\r\nbrewer or a shoemaker, most generally some demagogue, and, in many a\r\ntown or village, some deserter or soldier drummed out of his regiment\r\nfor bad conduct, perhaps one of the noble's own men, a scamp whom he has\r\nformerly discharged with the yellow cartridge, telling him to go and\r\nbe hung elsewhere. It is hard for the noble officer to be publicly and\r\ndaily calumniated on account of his rank and title, to be characterized\r\nas a traitor at the club and in the newspapers, to be designated by\r\nname as an object of popular suspicion and fury, to be hooted at in the\r\nstreets and in the theater, to submit to the disobedience of his men, to\r\nbe denounced, insulted, arrested, fleeced, hunted down and slaughtered\r\nby them and by the populace, to see before him a cruel, ignoble, and\r\nunavenged death--that of M. de Launay, murdered at Paris--that of M.\r\nde Belzunce, murdered at Caen--that of M. de Beausset, murdered at\r\nMarseilles--that of M. de Voisins, murdered at Valence--that of M. de\r\nRully, murdered at Bastia, or that of M. de Rochetailler, murdered at\r\nPort-au-Prince.[3335] All this is endured by the officers among the\r\nnobles. Not one of the municipalities, even Jacobin, can find any\r\npretext which will warrant the charge of disobeying orders. Through tact\r\nand deference they avoid all conflict with the National Guards. Never\r\ndo they give provocation, and, even when insulted, rarely defend\r\nthemselves. Their gravest faults consist of imprudent conversations,\r\nvivacious expressions and witticisms. Like good watch-dogs amongst a\r\nfrightened herd which trample them under foot, or pierce them with\r\ntheir horns, they allow themselves to be pierced and trampled on without\r\nbiting, and would remain at their post to the end were they not driven\r\naway from it.\r\n\r\nAll to no purpose: doubly suspicious as members of a proscribed class,\r\nand as heads of the army, it is against them that public distrust\r\nexcites the most frequent explosions, and so much the more as the\r\ninstrument they handle is singularly explosive. Recruited by volunteer\r\nenlistment \"amongst a passionate, turbulent, and somewhat debauched\r\npeople,\" the army is composed of \"all that are most fiery, most\r\nturbulent, and most debauched in the nation.\"[3336] Add to these the\r\nsweepings of the alms-houses, and you find a good many blackguards\r\nin uniform! When we consider that the pay is small, the food bad,\r\ndiscipline severe, no promotion, and desertion endemic, we are no longer\r\nsurprised at the general disorder: license, to such men, is too powerful\r\na temptation. With wine, women, and money they have from the first\r\nbeen made turncoats, and from Paris the contagion has spread to\r\nthe provinces. In Brittany,[3337] the grenadiers and chasseurs of\r\nIle-de-France \"sell their coats, their guns, and their shoes, exacting\r\nadvances in order to consume it in the tavern;\" fifty-six soldiers of\r\nPenthièvre \"wanted to murder their officers,\" and it is foreseen that,\r\nleft to themselves, they will soon, for lack of pay, \"betake themselves\r\nto the highways, to rob and assassinate.\" In Euree-et-Loir, the\r\ndragoons,[3338] with saber and pistols in hand, visit the farmers'\r\nhouses and take bread and money, while the foot soldiers of the\r\n\"Royal-Comtois\" and the dragoons of the \"Colonel-Général\" desert in\r\nbands in order to go to Paris, where amusement is to be had. The main\r\nthing with them is \"to have a jolly time.\" In fact, the extensive\r\nmilitary insurrections of the earliest date, those of Paris, Versailles,\r\nBesançon, and Strasbourg, began or ended with a revel.--Out of these\r\ndepths of gross desires there has sprung up natural or legitimate\r\nambitions. A number of soldiers, for twenty years past, have learned how\r\nto read, and think themselves qualified to be officers. One quarter of\r\nthose enlisted, moreover, are young men born in good circumstances, and\r\nwhom a caprice has thrown into the army. They choke in this narrow, low,\r\ndark, confined passage where the privileged by birth close up the issue,\r\nand they will march over their chiefs to secure advancement. These are\r\nthe discontented, the disputants, the orators of the mess-room, and\r\nbetween these barrack politicians and the politicians of the street an\r\nalliance is at once formed.--Starting from the same point they march on\r\nto the same end, and the imagination which has labored to blacken the\r\nGovernment in the minds of the people, blackens the officers in the\r\nminds of the soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury is empty and there are arrears of pay. The towns, burdened\r\nwith debt, no longer furnish their quotas of supplies; and at Orleans,\r\nwith the distress of the municipality before them, the Swiss of\r\nChateauvieux were obliged to impose on themselves a stoppage of one sou\r\nper day and per man to have wood in winter.[3339] Grain is scarce, the\r\nflour is spoilt, and the army bread, which was bad, has become worse.\r\nThe administration, worm-eaten by old abuses, is deranged through the\r\nnew disorder, the soldiers suffering as well through its dissolution\r\nas through their extravagance.--They think themselves robbed and\r\nthey complain, at first with moderation; and justice is done to their\r\nwell-founded claims. Soon they exact accounts, and these are made out\r\nfor them. At Strasbourg, on these being verified before Kellermann and\r\na commissioner of the National Assembly, it is proved that they have not\r\nbeen wronged out of a sou; nevertheless a gratification of six francs a\r\nhead is given to them, and they cry out that they are content and have\r\nnothing more to ask for. A few months after this fresh complaints arise,\r\nand there is a new verification: an ensign, accused of embezzlement and\r\nwhom they wished to hang, is tried in their presence; his accounting is\r\ntidy; none of them can cite against him a proven charge, and, once more,\r\nthey remain silent. On other occasions, after hearing the reading of\r\nregisters for several hours, they yawn, cease to listen, and go outside\r\nto get something to drink.--But the figures of their demands, as these\r\nhave been summed up by their mess-room calculators, remain implanted in\r\ntheir brains; they have taken root there, and are constantly springing\r\nup without any account or refutation being able to extirpate them. No\r\nmore writings nor speeches--what they want is money: 11,000 livres for\r\nthe Beaune regiment, 39,500 livres for that of Forez, 44,000 livres for\r\nthat of Salm, 200,000 livres for that of Chateauvieux, and similarly for\r\nthe rest. So much the worse for the officers if the money-chest does not\r\nsuffice for them; let them assess each other, or borrow on their note\r\nof hand from the municipality, or from the rich men of the town.--For\r\ngreater security, in divers places, the soldiers take possession of the\r\nmilitary chest and mount guard around it: it belongs to them, since they\r\nform the regiment, and, in any case, it is better that it should be in\r\ntheir hands than in suspected hands.--Already, on the 4th of June, 1790,\r\nthe Minister of War announces to the Assembly that \"the military body\r\nthreatens to fall into a perfect state of anarchy.\" His report shows\r\n\"the most incredible pretensions put forth in the most plain-spoken\r\nway--orders without force, chiefs without authority, the military chest\r\nand flags carried away, the orders of the King himself openly defied,\r\nthe officers condemned, insulted, threatened, driven off; some of them\r\neven captive amidst their own troops, leading a precarious life in\r\nthe midst of disgust and humiliations, and, as the climax of horror,\r\ncommanders having their throat cut under the eyes and almost in the arms\r\nof their own soldiers.\"\r\n\r\nIt is much worse after the July Federation. Entertained, flattered,\r\nand indoctrinated at the clubs, their delegates, inferior officers and\r\nprivates, return to the regiment Jacobins; and henceforth correspond\r\nwith the Jacobins of Paris, \"receiving their instructions and reporting\r\nto them,\"[3340]--Three weeks later, the Minister of War gives notice to\r\nthe National Assembly that there is no limit to the license in the army.\r\n\"Couriers, the bearers of fresh complaints, are arriving constantly.\"\r\nIn one place \"a statement of the fund is demanded, and it is proposed to\r\ndivide it.\" Elsewhere, a garrison, with drums beating, leaves the town,\r\ndeposes its officers, and comes back sword in hand. Each regiment is\r\ngoverned by a committee of soldiers. \"It is in this committee that the\r\ndetention of the lieutenant-colonel of Poitou has been twice arranged;\r\nhere it is that 'Royal-Champagne' conceived the insurrection\" by which\r\nit refused to recognize a sub-lieutenant sent to it. \"Every day\r\nthe minister's cabinet is filled with soldiers who are sent as\r\nrepresentatives to him, and who proudly come and intimate to him the\r\nwill of their constituents.\" Finally, at Strasbourg, seven regiments,\r\neach represented by three delegates, formed a military congress.\r\nThe same month, the terrible insurrection of Nancy breaks out--three\r\nregiments in revolt, the populace with them, the arsenal pillaged, three\r\nhours of furious fighting in the streets, the insurgents firing from the\r\nwindows of the houses and from the cellar openings, five hundred\r\ndead among the victors, and three thousand among the vanquished.--The\r\nfollowing month, and for six weeks,[3341] there is another insurrection,\r\nless bloody, but more extensive, better arranged and more obstinate,\r\nthat of the whole squadron at Brest, a mutiny of twenty thousand men,\r\nat first against their admiral and their officers, then against the new\r\npenal code and against the National Assembly itself. The latter,\r\nafter remonstrating in vain, is obliged not only not to take rigorous\r\nmeasures, but again to revise its laws.[3342]\r\n\r\nFrom this time forth, I cannot enumerate the constant outbreaks in the\r\nfleet and in the army.--Authorized by the minister, the soldier goes\r\nto the club, where he is repeatedly told that his officers, being\r\naristocrats, are traitors. At Dunkirk, he is additionally taught how to\r\nget rid of them. Clamors, denunciations, insults, musket-shots--these\r\nare the natural means, and they are put in practice: but there is\r\nanother, recently discovered, by which an energetic officer of whom they\r\nare afraid may be driven away. Some patriotic bully is found who comes\r\nand insults him. If the officer fights and is not killed, the municipal\r\nauthorities have him arraigned, and his chiefs send him off along with\r\nhis seconds \"in order not to disturb the harmony between the soldier and\r\nthe citizen.\" If he declines the proposed duel, the contempt of his men\r\nobliges him to quit the regiment. In either case he is got out of the\r\nway.[3343]--They have no scruples in relation to him. Present or absent,\r\na noble officer must certainly be plotting with his emigrant companions;\r\nand on this a story is concocted. Formerly, to prove that sacks of flour\r\nwere being thrown into the river, the soldiers alleged that these sacks\r\nwere tied with blue cords (cordons bleus). Now, to confirm the belief\r\nthat an officer is conspiring with Coblentz, it suffices to state that\r\nhe rides a white horse; a certain captain, at Strasbourg, barely escapes\r\nbeing cut to pieces for this crime; \"the devil could not get it out of\r\ntheir heads that he was acting as a spy, and that the little grey-hound\"\r\nwhich accompanies him on his rides \"is used to make signals. \"--One year\r\nafter, at the time when the National Assembly completes its work, M.\r\nde Lameth, M. Fréteau, and M. Alquier state before it that Luckner,\r\nRochambeau, and the most popular generals, \"no longer are responsible\r\nfor anything.\" The Auvergne regiment has driven away its officers and\r\nforms a separate society, which obeys no one. The second battalion of\r\nBeaune is on the point of setting fire to Arras. It is almost necessary\r\nto lay siege to Phalsbourg, whose garrison has mutinied. Here,\r\n\"disobedience to the general's orders is formal.\" There \"are soldiers\r\nwho have to be urged to stand sentinel; whom they dare not put in\r\nconfinement for discipline; who threaten to fire on their officers; who\r\nstray off the road, pillage everything, and take aim at the corporal who\r\ntries to bring them back.\" At Blois, a part of the regiment \"has just\r\narrived without either clothes or arms, the soldiers having sold all on\r\nthe road to provide for their debauchery.\" One among them, delegated by\r\nhis companions, proposes to the Jacobins at Paris to \"de-aristocratise\"\r\nthe army by cashiering all the nobles. Another declares, with the\r\napplause of the club, that \"seeing how the palisades of Givet are\r\nconstructed, he is going to denounce the Minister of War at the tribunal\r\nof the sixth arrondissement of Paris.\"\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that, for noble officers, the situation is no longer\r\ntenable. After waiting patiently for twenty-three months, many of them\r\nleft through conscientiousness, when the National Assembly, forcing a\r\nthird oath upon them, struck out of the formula the name of the King,\r\ntheir born general.[3344]--Others depart at the end of the Constituent\r\nAssembly, \"because they risk being hung.\" A large number resign at the\r\nend of 1791 and during the first months of 1792, in proportion as\r\nthe new code and the new recruiting system for the army develop their\r\nresults.[3345] In fact, on the one hand, through the soldiers and\r\ninferior officers having a voice in the election of their chiefs and\r\na seat in the military courts, \"there is no longer the shadow of\r\ndiscipline; verdicts are given from pure caprice; the soldier contracts\r\nthe habit of despising his superiors, of whose punishments he has no\r\nfear, and from whom he expects no reward; the officers are paralyzed\r\nto such a degree as to become entirely superfluous personages.\" On the\r\nother hand, the majority of the National Volunteers are composed of \"men\r\nbought by the communes\" and administrative bodies, worthless characters\r\nof the street-corners, rustic vagabonds forced to march by lot or\r\nbribery,\"[3346] and along with them, enthusiasts and fanatics to such an\r\nextent that, from March, 1792, from the spot of their enlistment to\r\nthe frontier, their track is everywhere marked by pillage, robbery,\r\ndevastation, and assassinations. Naturally, on the road and at the\r\nfrontier, they denounce, drive away, imprison, or murder their officers,\r\nand especially the nobles. 3/4 And yet, in this extremity, numbers of\r\nnoble officers, especially in the artillery and engineer corps, persist\r\nin remaining at their posts, some through liberal ideas, and others out\r\nof respect for their instructions; even after the 10th of August, even\r\nafter the 2nd of September, even after the 21st of January, like their\r\ngenerals Biron, Custine, de Flers, de Broglie, and de Montesquiou, with\r\nthe constant perspective of the guillotine that awaits them on leaving\r\nthe battlefield and even in the ministerial offices of Carnot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--Emigration and its causes.\r\n\r\n     The first laws against the emigrants.\r\n\r\nIt is, accordingly, necessary that the officers and nobles should go\r\naway, should go abroad; and not only they, but also their families.\r\n\"Gentlemen who have scarcely six hundred livres income set out on\r\nfoot,\"[3347] and there is no doubt as to the motive of their departure.\r\n\"Whoever will impartially consider the sole and veritable causes of\r\nthe emigration,\" says an honest man, \"will find them in anarchy. If the\r\nliberty of the individual had not been daily threatened, if;\" in the\r\ncivil as in the military order of things, \"the senseless dogma, preached\r\nby the factions, that crimes committed by the mob are the judgments of\r\nheaven, had not been put in practice, France would have preserved three\r\nfourths of her fugitives. Exposed for two years to ignominious dangers,\r\nto every species of outrage, to innumerable persecutions, to the steel\r\nof the assassin, to the firebrands of incendiaries, to the most\r\ninfamous charges, 'to the denouncement of' their corrupted domestics,\r\nto domiciliary visits\" prompted by the commonest street rumor, \"to\r\narbitrary imprisonment by the Committee of Inquiry,\" deprived of their\r\ncivil rights, driven out of primary meetings, \"they are held accountable\r\nfor their murmurs, and punished for a sensibility which would touch the\r\nheart in a suffering criminal.\"--\" Resistance is nowhere seen; from\r\nthe prince's throne to the parsonage of the priest, the tempest has\r\nprostrated all malcontents in resignation.\" Abandoned \"to the restless\r\nfury of the clubs, to informers, to intimidated officials, they find\r\nexecutioners on all sides where prudence and the safety of the State\r\nhave enjoined them not even to see enemies. . . . Whoever has detested\r\nthe enormities of fanaticism and of public ferocity, whoever has\r\nawarded pity to the victims heaped together under the ruins of so many\r\nlegitimate rights and odious abuses, whoever, finally, has dared to\r\nraise a doubt or a complaint, has been proclaimed an enemy of\r\nthe nation. After this representation of malcontents as so many\r\nconspirators, every crime committed against them has been legitimated in\r\npublic opinion.[3348] The public conscience, formed by the factions\r\nand by that band of political corsairs who would be the disgrace of a\r\nbarbarous nation, have considered attacks against property and towns\r\nsimply as national justice, while, more than once, the news of the\r\nmurder of an innocent person, or of a sentence which threatened him\r\nwith death, has been welcomed with shouts of joy Two systems of natural\r\nright, two orders of justice, two standards of morality were accordingly\r\nestablished; by one of these it was allowable to do against one's\r\nfellow-creature, a reputed aristocrat, that which would be criminal if\r\nhe were a patriot. . . . Was it foreseen that, at the end of two\r\nyears, France, teeming with laws, with magistrates, with courts, with\r\ncitizen-guards, bound by solemn oaths in the defense of order and the\r\npublic safety, would still and continually be an arena in which wild\r\nbeasts would devour unarmed men \"--With all, even with old men, widows\r\nand children, it is a crime to escape from their clutches. Without\r\ndistinguishing between those who fly to avoid becoming a prey, and\r\nthose who arm to attack the frontier, the Constituent and Legislative\r\nAssemblies alike condemn all absentees. The Constituent Assembly[3349]\r\ntrebled their real and personal taxes, and prescribed that there should\r\nbe a triple lien on their rents and dues. The Legislative Assembly\r\nsequestrates, confiscates, and puts into the market their possessions,\r\nreal and personal, amounting to nearly fifteen hundred millions of cash\r\nvalue. Let them return and place themselves under the knives of the\r\npopulace; otherwise they and their posterity shall all be beggars.--At\r\nthis stroke indignation overflows, and a bourgeois who is liberal and\r\na foreigner, Mallet du Pan, exclaims,[3350] \"What! twenty thousand\r\nfamilies absolutely ignorant of the Coblentz plans and of its\r\nassemblies, twenty thousand families dispersed over the soil of Europe\r\nby the fury of clubs, by the crimes of brigands, by constant lack of\r\nsecurity, by the stupid and cowardly inertia of petrified authorities,\r\nby the pillage of estates, by the insolence of it cohort of tyrants\r\nwithout bread or clothes, by assassinations and incendiarism, by the\r\nbase servility of silent ministers, by the whole series of revolutionary\r\nscourges,--what' these twenty thousand desolate families, women and old\r\nmen, must see their inheritances become the prey of national robbery!\r\nWhat! Madame Guillin, who was obliged to fly with horror from the\r\nland where monsters have burnt her dwelling, slaughtered and eaten\r\nher husband, and who live with impunity by the side of her home--shall\r\nMadame Guillin see her fortune confiscated for the benefit of the\r\ncommunities to which she owes her dreadful misfortunes! Shall M. de\r\nClarac, under penalty of the same punishment, go and restore the ruins\r\nof his chateau, where an army of scoundrels failed to smother him!\"--So\r\nmuch the worse for them if they dare not come back! They are to undergo\r\ncivil death, perpetual banishment, and, in case the ban be violated,\r\nthey will be given up to the guillotine. In the same case with them\r\nare others who, with still greater innocence, have left the territory,\r\nmagistrates, ordinary rich people, burgesses, or peasants, Catholics,\r\nand particularly one entire class, the nonjuring clergy, from the\r\ncardinal archbishop down to the simple village vicar, all prosecuted,\r\nthen despoiled, then crushed by the same popular oppression and by the\r\nsame legislative oppression, each of these two persecutions exciting and\r\naggravating the other to such an extent that, at last, the populace and\r\nthe law, one the accomplice of the other, no longer leave a roof nor\r\na piece of bread, nor an hour's safety to a gentleman or to a\r\npriest.[3351]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--Attitude of the non-juring priests.\r\n\r\n     How they become distrusted.--Illegal arrests by local\r\n     administrations.--Violence or complicity of the National\r\n     Guards.--Outrages by the populace.--Executive power in the\r\n     south.--The sixth jacquerie.--Its two causes.--Isolated\r\n     outbreaks in the north, east, and west,--General eruption in\r\n     the south and in the center.\r\n\r\nThe ruling passion flings itself on all obstacles, even those placed by\r\nitself across its own track. Through a vast usurpation the minority\r\nof non-believers, indifferent or lukewarm, has striven to impose its\r\necclesiastical forms on the Catholic majority, and the situation\r\nthereby created for the Catholic priest is such that unless he becomes\r\nschismatic, he cannot fail to appear as an enemy. In vain has he obeyed!\r\nHe has allowed his property to be taken, he has left his parsonage, he\r\nhas given the keys of the church to his successor, he has kept aloof;\r\nhe does not transgress, either by omission or commission, any article of\r\nany decree. In vain does he avail himself of his legal right to abstain\r\nfrom taking an oath repugnant to his conscience. This alone makes him\r\nappear to refuse the civic oath in which the ecclesiastical oath is\r\nincluded, to reject the constitution which he accepts in full minus a\r\nparasite chapter, to conspire against the new social and political order\r\nof things which he often approves of; and to which he almost always\r\nsubmits.[3352] In vain does he confine himself to his special and\r\nrecognized domain, the spiritual direction of things. Through this\r\nalone he resists the new legislators who pretend to furnish a spiritual\r\nguidance, for, by virtue of being orthodox, he must believe that the\r\npriest whom they elect is excommunicated, that his sacraments are vain;\r\nand, in his office as pastor, he must prevent his sheep from going to\r\ndrink at an impure source. In vain might he preach to them moderation\r\nand respect. Through the mere fact that the schism is effected, its\r\nconsequences unfold them selves, and the peasants will not always remain\r\nas patient as their pastor. They have known him for twenty years; he has\r\nbaptized them and married them; they believe that his is the only true\r\nmass; they are not satisfied to be obliged to attend another two or\r\nthree leagues away, and to leave the church, their church which their\r\nancestors built, and where from father to son they have prayed for\r\ncenturies, in the hands of a stranger, an intruder and heretic, who\r\nofficiates before almost empty benches, and whom gendarmes, with guns in\r\ntheir hands, have installed. Assuredly, as he passes through the street,\r\nthey will look upon him askance: it is not surprising that the women and\r\nchildren soon hoot at him, that stones are thrown at night through his\r\nwindows, that in the strongly Catholic departments, Upper and Lower\r\nRhine, Doubs and Jura, Lozère, Deux-Sêvres and Vendée, Finistère,\r\nMorbihan, and Côtes-du-Nord, he is greeted with universal desertion,\r\nand then expelled through public ill-will. It is not surprising that\r\nhis mass is interrupted and that his person is threatened;[3353] that\r\ndisaffection which thus far had only reached the upper class, descends\r\nto the popular strata; that, from one end of France to the other, a\r\nsullen hostility prevails against the new institutions; for now the\r\npolitical and social constitution is joined to the ecclesiastical\r\nconstitution like an edifice to its spire, and, through this sharp\r\npinnacle, seeks the storm even within the darkening clouds of heaven.\r\nThe evil all springs out of this unskillful, gratuitous, compulsory\r\nfusion, and, consequently, from those who effected it.\r\n\r\nBut never will a victorious party admit that it has made a mistake.\r\nIn its eyes the nonjuring priests are alone culpable; it is irritated\r\nagainst their factious conscience; and, to crush the rebellion even in\r\nthe inaccessible sanctuary of personal conviction, there is no legal or\r\nbrutal act of violence which it will not allow itself to commit.\r\n\r\nBehold, accordingly, a new sport thrown open; and the game is immensely\r\nplentiful. For it comprises not only the black or gray robes, more than\r\nforty thousand priests, over thirty thousand nuns, and several thousand\r\nmonks, but also the devoted orthodox, that is to say the women of the\r\nlow or middle class, and, without counting provincial nobles, a majority\r\nof the serious, steady bourgeoisie, a majority of the peasantry-almost\r\nthe whole population of several provinces, east, west, and in the south.\r\nA name is bestowed on them, as lately on the nobles; it is that of\r\nfanatic, which is equivalent to aristocrat, for it also designates\r\npublic enemies likewise placed by it beyond the pale of the law.\r\n\r\nLittle does it matter whether the law favors them, for it is interpreted\r\nagainst them, arbitrarily construed and openly violated by the partial\r\nor intimidated administrative bodies which the Constitution has\r\nwithdrawn from the control of the central authority and subjected to\r\nthe authority of popular gatherings. From the first months of 1791,\r\nthe hounding begins; the municipalities, districts, and departments\r\nthemselves often take the lead in beating up the game. Six months later,\r\nthe Legislative Assembly, by its decree of November 29,[3354] sounds the\r\ntally-ho, and, in spite of the King's veto, the hounds on all sides dash\r\nforward. During the month of April, 1792, forty-two departments pass\r\nagainst nonjuring priests \"acts which are neither prescribed nor\r\nauthorized by the Constitution,\" and, before the end of the Legislative\r\nAssembly, forty-three others will have followed in their train.--Through\r\nthis series of illegal acts, without offense, without trial, non-jurors\r\nare everywhere in France expelled from their parishes, relegated to the\r\nprincipal town of the department or district, in some places imprisoned,\r\nput on the same footing with the emigrants, and despoiled of their\r\nproperty, real and personal.[3355] Nothing more is wanting against them\r\nbut the general decree of deportation which is to come as soon as the\r\nAssembly can get rid of the King.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the National Guards, who have extorted the laws,\r\nendeavor to aggravate them in their application; and there is nothing\r\nstrange in their animosity. Commerce is at a standstill, industry\r\nlanguishes, the artisan and shopkeeper suffer, and, in order to account\r\nfor the universal discontent, it is attributed to the insubordination\r\nof the priest. Were it not for his stubbornness all would go well, since\r\nthe Constitution is perfect, and he is the only one who does not accept\r\nit. But, in not accepting it, he attacks it. He, therefore, is the last\r\nobstacle in the way of public happiness; he is the scapegoat, let us\r\ndrive the obnoxious creature away! And the urban militia, sometimes\r\non its own authority, sometimes instigated by the municipal body its\r\naccomplice; is seen disturbing public worship, dispersing congregations,\r\nseizing priests by the collar, pushing them by the shoulders out of\r\nthe town, and threatening them with hanging if they dare to return.\r\nAt Douay,[3356] with guns in hand, they force the directory of the\r\ndepartment to order the closing of all the oratories and chapels in\r\nhospitals and convents. At Caen, with loaded guns and with a cannon,\r\nthey march forth against the neighboring parish of Verson, break into\r\nhouses, gather up fifteen persons suspected of orthodoxy--canons,\r\nmerchants, artisans, workmen, women, girls, old men, and the infirm--cut\r\noff their hair, strike them with the but-ends of their muskets, and lead\r\nthem back to Caen fastened to the breach of the cannon; and all this\r\nbecause a nonjuring priest still officiated at Verson, and many pious\r\npersons from Caen attended his mass: Verson, consequently, is a focal\r\ncenter of counter-revolutionary gatherings. Moreover, in the houses\r\nwhich were broken into, the furniture was smashed, casks stove in, and\r\nthe linen, money, and plate stolen, the rabble of Caen having joined\r\nthe expedition.--Here, and everywhere, there is nothing to do but to\r\nlet this rabble have its own way; and as it operates against the\r\npossessions, the liberty; the life, and the sense of propriety of\r\ndangerous persons, the National Militia is careful not to interfere\r\nwith it. Consequently, the orthodox, both priests and believers, men and\r\nwomen, are now at its mercy, and, thanks to the connivance of the armed\r\nforce, which refuses to interpose, the rabble satisfy on the proscribed\r\nclass its customary instincts of cruelty, pillage, wantonness, and\r\ndestructiveness.\r\n\r\nWhether public or private, the order of the day is always to hinder\r\nworship, while the means employed are worthy of those who carry them\r\nout.--Here, a nonjuring priest having had the boldness to minister to\r\na sick person, the house which he has just entered is taken by assault,\r\nand the door and windows of a house occupied by another priest are\r\nsmashed.[3357] There, the lodgings of two workmen, who are accused of\r\nhaving had their infants baptized by a refractory priest, are sacked and\r\nnearly demolished. Elsewhere, a mob refuses to allow the body of an\r\nold curé, who had died without taking the oath, to enter the cemetery.\r\nFarther on, a church is assaulted during vespers, and everything is\r\nbroken to pieces: on the following day it is the turn of a neighboring\r\nchurch, and, in addition, a convent of Ursuline nuns is devastated.--At\r\nLyons, on Easter-day, 1791, as the people are leaving the six o'clock\r\nmass, a troop, armed with whips, falls upon the women.[3358] Stripped,\r\nbruised, prostrated, with their heads in the dirt, they are not left\r\nuntil they are bleeding and half-dead; one young girl is actually at the\r\npoint of death; and this sort of outrage occurs so frequently that even\r\nladies attending the orthodox mass in Paris dare not go out\r\nwithout sewing up their garments around them in the shape of\r\ndrawers.--Naturally, to make the most of the prey offered to them,\r\nhunting associations are formed. These exist in Montpellier, Arles,\r\nUzès, Alais, Nîmes, Carpentras, and in most of the towns or burgs of\r\nGard, Vaucluse, and l'Hérault, in greater or less number according to\r\nthe population of the city: some counting from ten to twelve, and others\r\nfrom two to three hundred determined men, of every description: among\r\nthem are found \"strike-hards\" (tape-dur), former brigands, and escaped\r\nconvicts with the brand still on their backs. Some of them oblige their\r\nmembers to wear a medal as a visible mark of recognition; all assume\r\nthe title of executive power, and declare that they act of their own\r\nauthority, and that it is necessary to \"quicken the law.\"[3359] Their\r\npretext is the protection of sworn priests; and for twenty months,\r\nbeginning with April, 1791, they operate to this effect with heavy\r\nknotted dubs garnished with iron points,\" without counting sabers and\r\nbayonets. Generally, their expeditions are nocturnal. Suddenly, the\r\nhouses of \"citizens suspected of a want of patriotism,\" of nonjuring\r\necclesiastics, of the monks of the Christian school, are invaded;\r\neverything is broken or stolen, and the owner is ordered to leave the\r\nplace in twenty-four hours: sometimes, doubtless through an excess of\r\nprecaution, he is beaten to death on the spot. Besides this, the band\r\nalso works by day in the streets, lashes the women, enters the churches\r\nsaber in hand, and drives the nonjuring priest from the altar. All of\r\nthis is done with the connivance and in the sight of the paralyzed\r\nor complaisant authorities, by a sort of occult and complementary\r\ngovernment, which not only supplies what is missing in the\r\necclesiastical law, but also searches the pockets of private\r\nindividuals.--At Nîmes, under the leadership of a patriotic\r\ndancing-master, not content with \"decreeing proscriptions, killing,\r\nscourging, and often murdering,\" these new champions of the Gallican\r\nChurch undertake to reanimate the zeal of those liable to contribution.\r\nA subscription having been proposed for the support of the families of\r\nthe volunteers about to depart, the executive power takes upon itself\r\nto revise the list of offerings: it arbitrarily taxes those who have not\r\ngiven, or who, in its opinion, have given too little some \"poor workmen\r\nfifty livres, others two hundred, three hundred, nine hundred, and\r\na thousand, under penalty of wrecked houses and severe treatment.\"\r\nElsewhere, the volunteers of Baux and other communes near Tarascon help\r\nthemselves freely, and, \"under the pretext that they are to march for\r\nthe defense of the country, levy enormous contributions on proprietors,\"\r\non one four thousand, and on another five thousand livres. In default of\r\npayment, they carry away all the grain on one farm, even to the reserve\r\nseed, threatening to make havoc with everything, and even to burn, in\r\ncase of complaint, so that the owners dare not say a word, while the\r\nattorney-general of the neighboring department, afraid on his own\r\naccount, begs that his denunciation may be kept secret.--From the slums\r\nof the towns the jacquerie has spread into the rural districts. This is\r\nthe sixth and the most extensive seen for three years.[3360]\r\n\r\nTwo spurs impel the peasant on.--On the one hand he is frightened by\r\nthe clash of arms, and the repeated announcements of an approaching\r\ninvasion. The clubs and the newspapers since the declaration of Pilnitz,\r\nand the Orators in the Legislative Assembly for four months past, have\r\nkept him alarmed with their trumpet-blasts, and he urges on his oxen in\r\nthe furrow with cries of \"Woa, Prussia!\" to one, and to the other, \"Gee\r\nup, Austria!\" Austria and Prussia, foreign kings and nobles in league\r\nwith the emigrant nobles, are going to return in force to re-establish\r\nthe salt-tax, the excise, feudal-dues, tithes, and to retake national\r\nproperty already sold and re-sold, with the aid of the gentry who have\r\nnot left, or who have returned, and the connivance of non-juring\r\npriests who declare the sale sacrilegious and refuse to absolve the\r\npurchasers.--On the other hand, Holy Week is drawing near, and for the\r\npast year qualms of conscience have disturbed the purchasers. Up to\r\nMarch 24, 1791, the sales of national property had amounted to only 180\r\nmillions; but, the Assembly having prolonged the date of payment and\r\nfacilitated further sales in detail, the temptation proves too strong\r\nfor the peasant; stockings and buried pots are all emptied of their\r\nsavings. In seven months the peasant has bought to the amount of 1,346\r\nmillions,[3361] and finally possesses in full and complete ownership the\r\nmorsel of land which he has coveted for so many years, and sometimes an\r\nunexpected plot, a wood, a mill, or a meadow. At the present time he has\r\nto settle accounts with the church, and, if the pecuniary settlement is\r\npostponed, the Catholic settlement comes on the appointed day.\r\nAccording to immemorial tradition he is obliged to take the communion\r\nat Easter,[3362] his wife also, and likewise his mother; and if he,\r\nexceptionally, does not think this of consequence, they do. Moreover, he\r\nrequires the sacraments for his old sick father, his new-born child, and\r\nfor his other child of an age to be confirmed. Now, communion, baptism,\r\nconfession, all the sacraments, to be of good quality, must proceed from\r\na safe source, just as is the case with flour and coin; there is only\r\ntoo much counterfeit money now in the world, and the sworn priests are\r\ndaily losing credit, like the assignats. There is no other course to\r\npursue, consequently, but to resort to the non-juror, who is the only\r\none able to give valid absolutions. And it so happens that he not only\r\nrefuses this, but he is said to be inimical to the whole new order of\r\nthings.--In this dilemma the peasant falls back upon his usual resource,\r\nthe strength of his arms; he seizes the priest by the throat, as\r\nformerly his lord, and extorts an acquittance for his sins as formerly\r\nfor his feudal dues. At the very least he strives to constrain the\r\nnon-jurors to swear, to close their separatist churches, and bring the\r\nentire canton to the same uniform faith.--Occasionally also he avenges\r\nhimself against the partisans of the non-jurors, against chateaux\r\nand houses of the opulent, against the nobles and the rich, against\r\nproprietors of every class. Occasionally, likewise, as, since the\r\namnesty of September, 1791, the prisons have been emptied, as one-half\r\nof the courts are not yet installed,[3363] as there has been no police\r\nfor thirty months, the common robbers, bandits, and vagrants, who swarm\r\nabout without repression or surveillance, join the mob and fill their\r\npockets.\r\n\r\nHere, in Pas-de-Calais,[3364] three hundred villagers, headed by a\r\ndrummer, burst open the doors of a Carthusian convent, steal everything,\r\neatables, beverages, linen, furniture, and effects, whilst, in the\r\nneighboring parish, another band operates in the same fashion in the\r\nhouses of the mayor and of the old curé, threatening \"to kill and\r\nburn all,\" and promising to return on the following Sunday.--There,\r\nin Bas-Rhin, near Fort Louis, twenty houses of the aristocrats are\r\npillaged.--Elsewhere in Ile-et-Vilaine, bodies of rural militia,\r\ncombined, go from parish to parish, and, increasing in numbers in\r\nconsequence of their very violence until they form bands of two thousand\r\nmen. They close churches, drive away nonjuring priests, remove clappers\r\nfrom the bells, eat and drink what they please at the expense of the\r\ninhabitants, and often, in the houses of the mayor or tax-registrar,\r\nindulge in the pleasure of breaking everything to pieces. Should any\r\npublic officer remonstrate with them they shout, \"At the aristocrat!\"\r\nOne of these unlucky counselors is struck on the back with the but-end\r\nof a musket, and two others have guns aimed at them; the chiefs of the\r\nexpedition are in no better predicament, and, according to their own\r\nadmission, if they are at the head of the mob it is to make sure they\r\nthemselves will not be pillaged or hung. The same spectacle presents\r\nitself in Mayenne, in Orne, in Moselle, and in the Landes.[3365]--These,\r\nhowever, are but isolated irruptions, and very mild; in the south and\r\nin the center, the plague is apparent in an immense leprous spot, which\r\nextending from Avignon to Perigueux, and from Aurillac to Toulouse,\r\nsuddenly covers, nearly without with any discontinuity, ten departments,\r\nVaucluse, Ardèche, Gard, Cantal, Corrèze, Lot, Dordogne, Gers,\r\nHaute-Garonne, and Hérault. Vast rural masses are set in motion at the\r\nsame time, on all sides and owing to the same causes: the approach of\r\nwar and the coming of Easter.--In Cantal, at the assembly of the canton\r\nheld at Aurillac for the recruitment of the army,[3366] the commander\r\nof a village National Guard demands vengeance \"against those who are not\r\npatriots,\" and the report is spread that an order has come from Paris to\r\ndestroy the chateaux. Moreover, the insurgents allege that the priests,\r\nthrough their refusal to take the oath, are bringing the nation into\r\ncivil war: \"we are tired of not having peace on their account; let them\r\nbecome good citizens, so that everybody may go to mass.\" On the strength\r\nof this, the insurgents enter houses, put the inhabitants to ransom,\r\nnot only priests and former nobles, \"but also those who are suspected\r\nof being their partisans, those who do not attend the mass of the\r\nconstitutional priest,\" and even poor people, artisans and tillers of\r\nthe ground, whom they tax five, ten, twenty, and forty francs, and\r\nwhose cellars and bread-bins they empty. Eighteen chateaux are pillaged,\r\nburnt, or demolished, and among others, those of several gentlemen and\r\nladies who have not left the country. One of these, M. d'Humières, is an\r\nold officer of eighty years; Madame de Peyronenc saves her son only by\r\ndisguising him as a peasant; Madame de Beauclerc, who flies across the\r\nmountain, sees her sick child die in her arms. At Aurillac, gibbets are\r\nset up before the principal houses; M. de Niossel, a former lieutenant\r\nof a criminal court, put in prison for his safety, is dragged out, and\r\nhis severed head is thrown on a dunghill; M. Collinet, just arrived\r\nfrom Malta, and suspected of being an aristocrat, is ripped open, cut\r\nto pieces, and his head is carried about on the end of a pike. Finally,\r\nwhen the municipal officers, judges, and royal commissioner commence\r\nproceedings against the assassins, they find themselves in such great\r\ndanger that they are obliged to resign or to run away. In like manner,\r\nin Haute-Garonne,[3367] it is also \"against non-jurors and their\r\nfollowers\" that the insurrection has begun. This is promoted by the fact\r\nthat in various parishes the constitutional curé belongs to the\r\nclub, and demands the riddance of his adversaries. One of them at\r\nSaint-Jean-Lorne, \"mounted on a cart, preaches pillage to a mob of\r\neight hundred persons.\" Each band, consequently, begins by expelling\r\nrefractory priests, and by forcing their supporters to attend the mass\r\nof the sworn priest.--But such success, wholly abstract and barren, is\r\nof little advantage, and peasants in a state of revolt are not satisfied\r\nso easily. When parishes march forth by the dozen and devote their day\r\nto the service of the public, they must have some compensation in wood,\r\nwheat, wine, or money,[3368] and the expense of the expedition may be\r\ndefrayed by the aristocrats. Not merely the upholders of non-jurors\r\nare aristocrats, as, for example, an old lady here and there, \"very\r\nfanatical, and who for forty years has devoted all her income to acts of\r\nphilanthropy,\" \"but well-to-do persons, peasants or gentlemen;\" for, \"by\r\nkeeping their wine and grain unsold in their cellars and barns, and by\r\nnot undertaking more work than they need, so as to deprive workmen in\r\nthe country of their means of subsistence,\" they design \"to starve out\"\r\nthe poor folk. Thus, the greater the pillage, the greater the service\r\nto the public. According to the insurgents, it is important \"to diminish\r\nrevenues enjoyed by the enemies of the nation, in order that they\r\nmay not send their revenues to Coblentz and other places out of the\r\nkingdom.\" Consequently, bands of six or eight hundred or a thousand men\r\noverrun the districts of Toulouse and Castelsarrasin. All proprietors,\r\naristocrats, and patriots are put under contribution. Here, in the\r\nhouse of \"the philanthropic but fanatical old maid, they break open\r\neverything, destroy the furniture, taking away eighty-two bushels of\r\nwheat and sixteen hogsheads of wine.\" Elsewhere, at Roqueferrière,\r\nfeudal title-deeds are burnt, and a chateau is pillaged. Farther on, at\r\nLasserre, thirty thousand francs are exacted and the ready money is\r\nall carried off. Almost everywhere the municipal officers, willingly or\r\nunwillingly, authorize pillaging. Moreover, \"they cut down provisions to\r\na price in assignats very much less than their current rate in silver,\"\r\nand they double the price of a day's work. In the meantime, other bands\r\ndevastate the national forests, and the gendarmes, in order not to be\r\ncalled aristocrats, have no idea but of paying court to the pillagers.\r\n\r\nAfter all this, it is manifest that property no longer exists for\r\nanybody except for paupers and robbers.--In effect, in Dordogne,[3369]\r\nunder the pretext of driving away nonjuring priests, frequently mobs\r\ngather to pillage and rob whatever comes in their way. . . . All the\r\ngrain that is found in houses with weathercocks is sequestrated.\"\r\nThe rustics exploit, as communal property, all the forests, all the\r\npossessions of the emigrants; and this operation is radical; for\r\nexample, a band, on finding a new barn of which the materials strike\r\nthem as good, demolish it so as to share with each other the tiles and\r\ntimber.--In Corrèze, fifteen thousand armed peasants, who have come to\r\nTulle to disarm and drive off the supporters of the non-jurors, break\r\neverything in suspected houses, and a good deal of difficulty is found\r\nin sending them off empty-handed. As soon as they get back home, they\r\nsack the chateaux of Saint-Gal, Seilhac, Gourdon, Saint-Basile, and La\r\nRochette, besides a number of country-houses, even of absent plebeians.\r\nThey have found a quarry, and never was the removal of property more\r\ncomplete. They carefully carry off, says an official statement, all that\r\ncan be carried--furniture, curtains, mirrors, clothes-presses, pictures,\r\nwines, provisions, even floors and wooden panels, \"down to the smallest\r\nfragments of iron and wood-work,\" smashing the rest, so that nothing\r\n\"remains of the house but its four walls, the roof and the staircase.\"\r\nIn Lot, where for two years the insurrection is permanent, the damage\r\nis much greater. During the night between the 30th and 31st of January,\r\n\"all the best houses in Souillac\" are broken open, \"sacked and pillaged\r\nfrom top to bottom,\"[3370] their owners being obliged to fly, and so\r\nmany outbreaks occur in the department, that the directory has no time\r\nto render an account of them to the minister. Entire districts are\r\nin revolt; as, \"in each commune all the inhabitants are accomplices,\r\nwitnesses cannot be had to support a criminal prosecution, and crime\r\nremains unpunished.\" In the canton of Cabrerets, the restitution of\r\nrents formerly collected is exacted, and the reimbursement of charges\r\npaid during twenty years past. The small town of Lauzerte is invaded by\r\nsurrounding bodies of militia, and its disarmed inhabitants are at\r\nthe mercy of the Jacobin suburbs. For three months, in the district of\r\nFigeac, \"all the mansions of former nobles are sacked and burnt;\" next\r\nthe pigeon-cots are attacked, \"and all country-houses which have a good\r\nappearance.\" Barefooted gangs \"enter the houses of well-to-do people,\r\nphysicians, lawyers, merchants, burst open the doors of cellars, drink\r\nthe wine,\" and riot like drunken victors. In several communes these\r\nexpeditions have become a custom; \"a large number of individuals are\r\nfound in them who live on rapine alone,\" and the club sets them the\r\nexample. For six months, in the principal town, a coterie of the\r\nNational Guard, called the Black Band, expel all persons who are\r\ndispleasing to them, \"pillaging houses at will, beating to death,\r\nwounding or mutilating by saber-strokes, all who have been proscribed in\r\ntheir assemblies,\" and no official or advocate dares lodge a complaint.\r\nBrigandage, borrowing the mask of patriotism, and patriotism borrowing\r\nthe methods of brigandage, have combined against property at the same\r\ntime as against the ancient régime, and, to free themselves from all\r\nthat inspires them with fear, they seize all which can provide them with\r\nbooty.\r\n\r\nAnd yet this is merely the outskirts of the storm; the center is\r\nelsewhere, around Nîmes, Avignon, Arles, and Marseilles, in a country\r\nwhere, for a long time, the conflict between cities and the conflict\r\nbetween religions have kindled and accumulated malignant passions.[3371]\r\nLooking at the three departments of Gard, Bouches-de-Rhône and Vaucluse,\r\none would imagine one's self in the midst of a war with savages.\r\nIn fact, it is a Jacobin and plebeian invasion, and, consequently,\r\nconquest, dispossession, and extermination,--in Gard, a swarm of\r\nNational Guards copy the jacquerie: the dregs of the Comtat come to the\r\nsurface and cover Vaucluse with its scum; an army of six thousand from\r\nMarseilles sweeps down on Arles.--In the districts of Nîmes, Sommières,\r\nUzès, Alais, Jalais, and Saint-Hippolyte, title-deeds are burnt,\r\nproprietors put to ransom, and municipal officers threatened with death\r\nif they try to interpose; twenty chateaux and forty country-houses are\r\nsacked, burnt, and demolished.--The same month, Arles and Avignon,[3372]\r\ngiven up to the bands of Marseilles and of the Comtat, see confiscation\r\nand massacres approaching.--Around the commandant, who has received the\r\norder to evacuate Aries,[3373] \"the inhabitants of all parties\" gather\r\nas suppliants, \"clasping his hands, entreating him with tears in their\r\neyes not to abandon them; women and children cling to his boots,\" so\r\nthat he does not know how to free himself without hurting them; on his\r\ndeparture twelve hundred families emigrate. After the entrance of the\r\nMarseilles band we see eighteen hundred electors proscribed, their\r\ncountry-houses on the two banks of the Rhone pillaged, \"as in the times\r\nof Saracen pirates,\" a tax of 1,400,000 livres levied on all people in\r\ngood circumstances, absent or present, women and girls promenaded\r\nabout half-naked on donkeys and publicly whipped.\" \"A saber committee\"\r\ndisposes of lives, proscribes and executes: it is the reign of sailors,\r\nporters, and the dregs of the populace.--At Avignon,[3374] it is that of\r\nsimple brigands, incendiaries and assassins, who, six months previously,\r\nconverted the Glacière[3375] into a charnel-house. They return in\r\ntriumph and state that \"this time the Glacière will be full.\" Five\r\nhundred families had already sought asylum in France before the first\r\nmassacre; now, the entire remainder of the honest bourgeoisie, twelve\r\nhundred persons, take to flight, and the terror is so great that the\r\nsmall neighboring towns dare not receive emigrants. In fact, from this\r\ntime forth, both departments throughout Vaucluse and Bouches-de-Rhône\r\nare a prey: Bands of two thousand armed men, with women, children, and\r\nother volunteer followers, travel from commune to commune to live as\r\nthey please at the expense of \"fanatics.\" The well-bred people are not\r\nthe only ones they despoil. Plain cultivators, taxed at 10,000 livres,\r\nhave sixty men billeted on them; their cattle are slain and eaten before\r\ntheir eyes, and everything in their houses is broken up; they are driven\r\nout of their lodgings and wander as fugitives in the reed-swamps of the\r\nRhone, awaiting a moment of respite to cross the river and take refuge\r\nin the neighboring department.[3376] Thus, from the spring of 1792,\r\nif any citizen is suspected of unfriendliness or even of indifference\r\ntowards the ruling faction, if, through but one opinion conscientiously\r\nheld, he risks the vague possibility of mistrust or of suspicion, he\r\nundergoes popular hostility, pillage, exile, and worse besides; no\r\nmatter how loyal his conduct may be, nor how loyal he may be at heart,\r\nno matter that he is disarmed and inoffensive; it is all the same\r\nwhether it be a noble, bourgeois, peasant, aged priest, or woman; and\r\nthis while public peril is yet neither great, present, nor visible,\r\nsince France is at peace with Europe, and the government still subsists\r\nin its entirety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--General state of opinion.\r\n\r\n     The three convoys of non-juring priests on the Seine.--\r\n     Psychological aspects of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nWhat will it be, then, now when the peril, already become palpable and\r\nserious, is daily increasing, now when war has begun, when Lafayette's\r\narmy is falling back in confusion, when the Assembly declares the\r\ncountry in danger, when the King is overthrown, when Lafayette defects\r\nand goes abroad, when the soil of France is invaded, when the frontier\r\nfortresses surrender without resistance, when the Prussians are entering\r\nChampagne, when the insurrection in La Vendée adds the lacerations of\r\ncivil war to the threats of a foreign war, and when the cry of treachery\r\narises on all sides?--Already, on the 14th of May, at Metz,[3377] M.\r\nde Fiquelmont, a former canon, seen chatting with a hussar on the Place\r\nSaint-Jacques, was charged with tampering with people on behalf of the\r\nprinces, carried off in spite of a triple line of guards, and beaten,\r\npierced, and slashed with sticks, bayonets, and sabers, while the mad\r\ncrowd around the murderers uttered cries of rage: and from month to\r\nmonth, in proportion as popular fears increase, popular imagination\r\nbecomes more heated and its delirium grows.--You can see this yourself\r\nby one example. On the 31st of August, 1792,[3378] eight thousand\r\nnon-juring priests, driven out of their parishes, are at Rouen, a town\r\nless intolerant than the others, and, in conformity with the decree\r\nwhich banishes them, are preparing to leave France. Two vessels have\r\njust carried away about a hundred of them; one hundred and twenty others\r\nare embarking for Ostend in a larger vessel. They take nothing with them\r\nexcept a little money, some clothes, and one or at most two portions of\r\ntheir breviary, because they intend to return soon. Each has a regular\r\npassport, and, just at the moment of leaving, the National Guard have\r\nmade a thorough inspection so as not to let a suspected person escape.\r\nIt makes no difference. On reaching Quilleboeuf the first two convoys\r\nare stopped. A report has spread, indeed, that the priests are going to\r\njoin the enemy and enlist, and the people living round about jump\r\ninto their boats and surround the vessels. The priests are obliged to\r\ndisembark amidst a tempests of \"yells, blasphemies, insults, and abuse:\"\r\none of them, a white-headed old man, having fallen into the mud, the\r\ncries and shouts redouble; if he is drowned so much the better, there\r\nwill be one less! On landing all are put in prison, on bare stones,\r\nwithout straw or bread, and word is sent to Paris to know what must be\r\ndone with so many cassocks. In the meantime the third vessel, short of\r\nprovisions, has sent two priests to Quilleboeuf and to Pont-Audemer to\r\nhave twelve hundred pounds of bread baked: pointed out by the village\r\nmilitia, they are chased out like wild beasts, pass the night in a wood,\r\nand find their way back with difficulty empty-handed. The vessel itself\r\nbeing signaled, is besieged. \"In all the municipalities on the banks of\r\nthe river drums beat incessantly to warn the population to be on their\r\nguard. The appearance of an Algerian or Tripolitan corsair on the shores\r\nof the Adriatic would cause less excitement. One of the seamen of the\r\nvessel published a statement that the trunks of the priests transported\r\nwere full of every kind of arms.\" and the country people constantly\r\nimagine that they are going to fall upon them sword and pistol in hand.\r\nFor several long days the famished convoy remains moored in the stream,\r\nare carefully watched. Boats filled with volunteers and peasants row\r\naround it uttering insults and threats: in the neighboring meadows the\r\nNational Guards form themselves in line of battle. Finally, a decision\r\nis arrived at. The bravest, well armed get into skiffs, approach the\r\nvessel cautiously, choose the most favorable time and spot, rush on\r\nboard, and take possession; and are perfectly astonished to find neither\r\nenemies nor arms.--Nevertheless, the priests are confined on board, and\r\ntheir deputies, must make their appearance before the mayor. The latter,\r\na former usher and good Jacobin, being the most frightened, is the most\r\nviolent. He refuses to stamp the passports, and, seeing two priests\r\napproach, one provided with a sword-cane and the other with an\r\niron-pointed stick, thinks that there is to be a sudden attack. \"Here\r\nare two more of them,\" he exclaims with terror; \"they are all going to\r\nland. My friends, the town is in danger!\"--On hearing this the crowd\r\nbecomes alarmed, and threatens the deputies; the cry of \"To the lamp\r\npost!\" is heard, and, to save them, National Guards are obliged to\r\nconduct them to prison in the center of a circle of bayonets.--It must\r\nbe noted that these madmen are \"at bottom the kindest people in the\r\nworld.\" After the boarding of the ship, one of the most ferocious,\r\nby profession a barber, seeing the long beards of these poor priests,\r\ninstantly cools down, draws forth his tools, and good-naturedly sets\r\nto work, spending several hours in shaving them. In ordinary times\r\necclesiastics received nothing but salutations; three years previously\r\nthey were \"respected as fathers and guides.\" But at the present moment\r\nthe rustic, the man of the lower class, is out of his bearings. Forcibly\r\nand against nature, he has been made a theologian, a politician, a\r\npolice captain, a local independent sovereign; and in such a position\r\nhis head is turned. Among these people who seem to have lost their\r\nsenses, only one, an officer of the National Guard, remains cool; he is,\r\nbesides, very polite, well-behaved, and an agreeable talker; he comes\r\nin the evening to comfort the prisoners and to take tea with them\r\nin prison; in fact, he is accustomed to tragedies and, thanks to his\r\nprofession, his nerves are in repose--this person is the executioner.\r\nThe others, \"whom one would take for tigers,\" are bewildered sheep; but\r\nthey are not the less dangerous; for, carried away by their delirium,\r\nthey bear down with their mass on whatever gives them umbrage.--On\r\nthe road from Paris to Lyons[3379] Roland's commissioners witness this\r\nterrible fright. \"The people are constantly asking what our generals\r\nand armies are doing; they have vengeful expressions frequently on their\r\nlips. Yes, they say, we will set out, but we must (at first) purge the\r\ninterior.\"\r\n\r\nSomething appalling is in preparation. The seventh jacquerie is drawing\r\nnear, this one universal and final--at first brutal, and then legal\r\nand systematic, undertaken and carried out on the strength of abstract\r\nprinciples by leaders worthy of the means they employ. Nothing like it\r\never occurred in history; for the first time we see brutes gone mad,\r\noperating on a grand scale and for a long time, under the leadership of\r\nblockheads who have become insane.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain strange malady commonly encountered in the quarters\r\nof the poor. A workman, over-taxed with work, in misery and badly fed,\r\ntakes to drink; he drinks more and more every day, and liquors of the\r\nstrongest kind. After a few years his nervous system, already weakened\r\nby spare diet, becomes over-excited and out of balance. An hour comes\r\nwhen the brain, under a sudden stroke, ceases to direct the machine; in\r\nvain does it command, for it is no longer obeyed; each limb, each\r\njoint, each muscle, acting separately and for itself starts convulsively\r\nthrough discordant impulses. Meanwhile the man is gay; he thinks himself\r\na millionaire, a king, loved and admired by everybody; he is not aware\r\nof the mischief he is doing to himself he does not comprehend the advice\r\ngiven him, he refuses the remedies offered to him, he sings and shouts\r\nfor entire days, and, above all, drinks more than ever.--At last his\r\nface grows dark and his eyes become blood-shot. Radiant visions give way\r\nto black and monstrous phantoms; he sees nothing around him hut menacing\r\nfigures, traitors in ambush, ready to fall upon him unawares, murderers\r\nwith upraised arms ready to cut his throat, executioners preparing\r\ntorments for him; and he seems to be wading in a pool of blood. So he\r\nprecipitates, and, in order that he himself may not be killed, he\r\nkills. No one is more to be dreaded, for his delirium sustains him;\r\nhis strength is prodigious, his movements unforeseen, and he endures,\r\nwithout heeding them, suffering and wounds under which a healthy man\r\nwould succumb.--France, like such a madman, exhausted by fasting under\r\nthe monarchy, drunk by the unhealthy drug of the Social-Contract, and by\r\ncountless other adulterated or fiery beverages, is suddenly struck with\r\nparalysis of the brain; at once she is convulsed in every limb through\r\nthe incoherent play and contradictory twitching of her discordant\r\norgans. At this time she has traversed the period of joyous madness, and\r\nis about to enter upon the period of somber delirium: behold her capable\r\nof daring, suffering, and doing all, capable of incredible exploits and\r\nabominable barbarities, the moment her guides, as erratic as herself,\r\nindicate an enemy or an obstacle to her fury.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3301: Moniteur, XI. 763.
