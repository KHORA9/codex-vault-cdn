HEPSA ELY SILLIMAN\r\n                           MEMORIAL LECTURES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1883 a legacy of eighty thousand dollars was left to the\r\nPresident and Fellows of Yale College in the city of New Haven, to be\r\nheld in trust, as a gift from her children, in memory of their beloved\r\nand honored mother, Mrs. Hepsa Ely Silliman.\r\n\r\nOn this foundation Yale College was requested and directed to establish\r\nan annual course of lectures designed to illustrate the presence and\r\nprovidence, the wisdom and goodness of God, as manifested in the natural\r\nand moral world. These were to be designated as the Mrs. Hepsa Ely\r\nSilliman Memorial Lectures. It was the belief of the testator that any\r\norderly presentation of the facts of nature or history contributed to\r\nthe end of this foundation more effectively than any attempt to\r\nemphasize the elements of doctrine or of creed; and he therefore\r\nprovided that lectures on dogmatic or polemical theology should be\r\nexcluded from the scope of this foundation, and that the subjects should\r\nbe selected rather from the domains of natural science and history,\r\ngiving special prominence to astronomy, chemistry, geology, and anatomy.\r\n\r\nIt was further directed that each annual course should be made the basis\r\nof a volume to form part of a series constituting a memorial to Mrs.\r\nSilliman. The memorial fund came into the possession of the Corporation\r\nof Yale University in the year 1901; and the present volume constitutes\r\nthe fourteenth of the series of memorial lectures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SILLIMAN MEMORIAL LECTURES\r\n\r\n                   PUBLISHED BY YALE UNIVERSITY PRESS\r\n\r\n\r\n  ELECTRICITY AND MATTER. _By_ JOSEPH JOHN THOMSON, D.S.C., L.L.D,\r\n    PH.D., F.R.S., _Fellow of Trinity College and Cavendish Professor of\r\n    Experimental Physics, Cambridge University_.\r\n\r\n                  (_Fourth printing._) _Price $1.50 net._\r\n\r\n  THE INTEGRATIVE ACTION OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. _By_ CHARLES S.\r\n    SHERRINGTON, D.SC., M.D., HON.

The opening chapter gives a somewhat detailed account of the\r\nearly days of the Journal, with a sketch of its subsequent history. The\r\nremaining chapters are devoted to the principal branches of science\r\nwhich have been prominent in the pages of the Journal. They have been\r\nwritten with a view to showing in each case the position of the science\r\nin 1818 and the general progress made during the century; special\r\nprominence is given to American science and particularly to the\r\ncontributions to it to be found in the Journal’s pages. References to\r\nspecific papers in the Journal are in most cases included in the text\r\nand give simply volume, page, and date, as (=24=, 105, 1833); when these\r\nand other references are in considerable number they have been brought\r\ntogether as a Bibliography at the end of the chapter.\r\n\r\nThe entire cost of the present book is defrayed from the income of the\r\nMrs. Hepsa Ely Silliman Memorial Fund, established under the will of\r\nAugustus Ely Silliman, a nephew of Benjamin Silliman, who died in 1884.\r\nCertain of the chapters here printed have been made the basis of a\r\nseries of seven Silliman Lectures in accordance with the terms of that\r\ngift. The selection of these lectures has been determined by the\r\nconvenience of the gentlemen concerned and in part also by the nature of\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    Page\r\n\r\n Prefatory Note                                                      vii\r\n\r\n    I.

DANA\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Introduction._\r\n\r\nIn July, 1818, one hundred years ago, the first number of the American\r\nJournal of Science and Arts was given to the public. This is the only\r\nscientific periodical in this country to maintain an uninterrupted\r\nexistence since that early date, and this honor is shared with hardly\r\nmore than half a dozen other independent scientific periodicals in the\r\nworld at large. Similar publications of learned societies for the same\r\nperiod are also very few in number.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, on the occasion of this centenary, to glance back at\r\nthe position of science and scientific literature in the world’s\r\nintellectual life in the early part of the nineteenth century, and to\r\nconsider briefly the marvelous record of combined scientific and\r\nindustrial progress of the hundred years following—subjects to be\r\nhandled in detail in the succeeding chapters. It is fitting also that we\r\nshould recall the man who founded the Journal, the conditions under\r\nwhich he worked, and the difficulties he encountered. Finally, we must\r\nreview, but more briefly, the subsequent history of what has so often\r\nbeen called after its founder, “Silliman’s Journal.”\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century, and particularly the hundred years in which we\r\nare now interested, must always stand out in the history of the world as\r\nthe period which has combined the greatest development in all\r\ndepartments of science with the most extraordinary industrial progress.\r\nIt was not until this century that scientific investigation used to\r\ntheir full extent the twin methods of observation and experiment. In\r\ncases too numerous to mention they have given us first, a tentative\r\nhypothesis; then, through the testing and correcting of the hypothesis\r\nby newly acquired data, an accepted theory has been arrived at; finally,\r\nby the same means carried further has been established one of nature’s\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n_Early Science._—Looking far back into the past, it seems surprising\r\nthat science should have had so late a growth, but the wonderful record\r\nof man’s genius in the monuments he erected and in architectural remains\r\nshows that the working of the human mind found expression first in art\r\nand further man also turned to literature. So far as man’s thought was\r\nconstructive, the early results were systems of philosophy, and\r\nexplanations of the order of things as seen from within, not as shown by\r\nnature herself. We date the real beginning of science with the Greeks,\r\nbut it was the century that preceded Aristotle that saw the building of\r\nthe Parthenon and the sculptures of Phidias. Even the great Aristotle\r\nhimself (384–322 B. C.) though he is sometimes called the “founder of\r\nnatural history,” was justly accused by Lord Bacon many centuries later\r\nof having formed his theories first and then to have forced the facts to\r\nagree with them.\r\n\r\nThe bringing together of facts through observation alone began, to be\r\nsure, very early, for it was the motion of the sun, moon, and stars and\r\nthe relation of the earth to them that first excited interest, and,\r\nespecially in the countries of the East, led to the accumulation of data\r\nas to the motion of the planets, of comets and the occurrence of\r\neclipses. But there was no coördination of these facts and they were so\r\ninvolved in man’s superstition as to be of little value. In passing,\r\nhowever, it is worthy of mention that the Chinese astronomical data\r\naccumulated more than two thousand years before the Christian era have\r\nin trained hands yielded results of no small significance.\r\n\r\nDoubtless were full knowledge available as to the science existing in\r\nthe early civilizations, we should rate it higher than we can at\r\npresent, but it would probably prove even then to have been developed\r\nfrom within, like the philosophies of the Greeks, and with but minor\r\ninfluence from nature herself. It is indeed remarkable that down to the\r\ntime with which we are immediately concerned, it was the branches of\r\nmathematics, as arithmetic and geometry and later their applications,\r\nthat were first and most fully developed: in other words those lines of\r\nscience least closely connected with nature.\r\n\r\nOf the importance to science of the Greek school at Alexandria in the\r\nsecond and third centuries B. C., there can be no question. The geometry\r\nof Euclid (about 300 B. C.) was marvelous in its completeness as in\r\nclearness of logical method. Hipparchus (about 160–125 B. C.) gave the\r\nworld the elements of trigonometry and developed astronomy so that\r\nPtolemy 260 years later was able to construct a system that was well\r\ndeveloped, though in error in the fundamental idea as to the relative\r\nposition of the earth. It is interesting to note that the Almagest of\r\nPtolemy was thought worthy of republication by the Carnegie Institution\r\nonly a year or two since. This great astronomical work, by the way, had\r\nno successor till that of the Arab Ulugh Bey in the fifteenth century,\r\nwhich within a few months has also been made available by the same\r\nInstitution.\r\n\r\nTo the Alexandrian school also belongs Archimedes (287–212 B. C.), who,\r\nas every school boy knows, was the founder of mechanics and in fact\r\nalmost a modern physical experimenter. He invented the water screw for\r\nraising water; he discovered the principle of the lever, which appealed\r\nso keenly to his imagination that he called for a ποῦ στῶ, or fulcrum,\r\non which to place it so as to move the earth itself. He was still nearer\r\nto modern physics in his reputed plan of burning up a hostile fleet by\r\nconverging the sun’s rays by a system of great mirrors.\r\n\r\nTo the Romans, science owes little beyond what is implied in their vast\r\narchitectural monuments, buildings and aqueducts which were erected at\r\nhome and in the countries of their conquests. The elder Pliny (23–79 A.\r\nD.) most nearly deserved to be called a man of science, but his work on\r\nnatural history, comprised in thirty-seven volumes, is hardly more than\r\na compilation of fable, fact, and fancy, and is sometimes termed a\r\ncollection of anecdotes. He lost his life in the “grandest geological\r\nevent of antiquity,” the eruption of Vesuvius, which is vividly\r\ndescribed by his nephew, the younger Pliny, in “one of the most\r\nremarkable literary productions in the domain of geology” (Zittel).\r\n\r\nWith the fall of Rome and the decline of Roman civilization came a\r\nperiod of intellectual darkness, from which the world did not emerge\r\nuntil the revival of learning in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\r\nThen the extension of geographical knowledge went hand in hand with the\r\ndevelopment of art, literature, and the birth of a new science.\r\nCopernicus (1473–1543) gave the world at last a sun-controlled solar\r\nsystem; Kepler (1571–1630) formulated the laws governing the motion of\r\nthe planets; Galileo (1564–1642) with his telescope opened up new vistas\r\nof astronomical knowledge and laid the foundations of mechanics; while\r\nLeonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), painter, sculptor, architect, engineer,\r\nmusician and true scientist, studied the laws of falling bodies and\r\nsolved the riddle of the fossils in the rocks. Still later Newton\r\n(1642–1727) established the law of gravitation, developed the calculus,\r\nput mechanics upon a solid basis and also worked out the properties of\r\nlenses and prisms so that his Optics (1704) will always have a prominent\r\nplace in the history of science.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the Renaissance on science grew steadily, but it was\r\nnot till the latter half of the eighteenth century that the foundations\r\nin most of the lines recognized to-day were fully laid. Much of what was\r\naccomplished then is, at least, outlined in the chapters following.\r\n\r\nOur standpoint in the early years of the nineteenth century, just before\r\nthe American Journal had its beginning, may be briefly summarized as\r\nfollows: A desire for knowledge was almost universal and, therefore,\r\nalso a general interest in the development of science. Mathematics was\r\nfirmly established and the mathematical side of astronomy and natural\r\nphilosophy—as physics was then called—was well developed. Many of the\r\nphenomena of heat and their applications, as in the steam engine of\r\nWatt, were known and even the true nature of heat had been almost\r\nestablished by our countryman, Count Rumford; but of electricity there\r\nwere only a few sparks of knowledge. Chemistry had had its foundation\r\nfirmly laid by Priestley, Lavoisier, and Dalton, while Berzelius was\r\npushing rapidly forward. Geology had also its roots down, chiefly\r\nthrough the work of Hutton and William Smith, though the earth was as\r\nyet essentially an unexplored field. Systematic zoology and botany had\r\nbeen firmly grounded by Buffon, Lamarck and Cuvier, on the one hand, and\r\nLinnæus on the other; but of all that is embraced under the biology of\r\nthe latter half of the nineteenth century the world knew nothing. The\r\nstatements of Silliman in his Introductory Remarks in the first number,\r\nquoted in part on a following page, put the matter still more fully, but\r\nthey are influenced by the enthusiasm of the time and he could have had\r\nlittle comprehension of what was to be the record of the next one\r\nhundred years.\r\n\r\nNow, leaving this hasty and incomplete retrospect and coming down to\r\n1918, we find the contrast between to-day and 1818 perhaps most\r\nstrikingly brought out, on the material side, if we consider the ability\r\nof man, in the early part of the nineteenth century, to meet the demands\r\nupon him in the matter of transportation of himself and his property. In\r\n1800, he had hardly advanced beyond his ancestor of the earliest\r\ncivilization; on the contrary, he was still dependent for transportation\r\non land upon the muscular efforts of himself and domesticated animals,\r\nwhile at sea he had only the use of sails in addition. The first\r\napplication of the steam engine with commercial success was made by\r\nFulton when, in 1807, the steamboat “Clermont” made its famous trip on\r\nthe Hudson River. Since then, step by step, transportation has been made\r\nmore and more rapid, economical and convenient, both on land and water.\r\nThis has come first through the perfection of the steam engine; later\r\nthrough the agency of electricity, and still further and more\r\nuniversally by the use of gasolene motors. Finally, in these early years\r\nof the twentieth century, what seemed once a wild dream of the\r\nimagination has been realized, and man has gained the conquest of the\r\nair; while the perfection of the submarine is as wonderful as its work\r\ncan be deadly.\r\n\r\nHardly less marvelous is the practical annihilation of space and time in\r\nthe electric transmission of human thought and speech by wire and by\r\nether waves. While, still further, the same electrical current now gives\r\nman his artificial illumination and serves him in a thousand ways\r\nbesides.\r\n\r\nBut the limitations of space have also been conquered, during the same\r\nperiod, by the spectroscope which brings a knowledge of the material\r\nnature of the sun and the fixed stars and of their motion in the line of\r\nsight; while spectrum analysis has revealed the existence of many new\r\nelements and opened up vistas as to the nature of matter.\r\n\r\nThe chemist and the physicist, often working together in the\r\ninvestigation of the problems lying between their two departments, have\r\naccumulated a staggering array of new facts from which the principles of\r\ntheir sciences have been deduced. Many new elements have been\r\ndiscovered, in fact nearly all called for by the periodic law; the\r\nso-called fixed gases have been liquefied, and now air in liquid form is\r\nalmost a plaything; the absolute zero has been nearly reached in the\r\nboiling point of helium; physical measurements in great precision have\r\nbeen carried out in both directions for temperatures far beyond any\r\nscale that was early conceived possible; the atom, once supposed to be\r\nindivisible, has been shown to be made up of the much smaller electrons,\r\nwhile its disintegration in radium and its derivatives has been traced\r\nout and with consequences only as yet partly understood but certainly\r\nhaving far-reaching consequences; at one point we seem to be brought\r\nnear to the transmutation of the elements which was so long the dream of\r\nthe alchemist. Still again photography has been discovered and perfected\r\nand with the use of X-rays it gives a picture of the structure of bodies\r\ntotally opaque to the eye; the same X-rays seem likely to locate and\r\ndetermine the atoms in the crystal.\r\n\r\nHere and at many other points we are reaching out to a knowledge of the\r\nultimate nature of matter.\r\n\r\nIn geology, vast progress has been made in the knowledge of the earth,\r\nnot only as to its features now exhibited at or near the surface, but\r\nalso as to its history in past ages, of the development of its\r\nstructure, the minute history of its life, the phenomena of its\r\nearthquakes, volcanoes, etc. Geological surveys in all civilized\r\ncountries have been carried to a high degree of perfection.\r\n\r\nIn biology, itself a word which though used by Lamarck did not come into\r\nuse till taken up by Huxley, and then by Herbert Spencer in the middle\r\nof the century, the progress is no less remarkable as is well developed\r\nin a later chapter of this volume.\r\n\r\nAlthough not falling within our sphere, it would be wrong, too, not to\r\nrecognize also the growth of medicine, especially through the knowledge\r\nof bacteria and their functions, and of disease germs and the methods of\r\ncombating them. The world can never forget the debt it owes to Pasteur\r\nand Lister and many later investigators in this field.\r\n\r\nTo follow out this subject further would be to encroach upon the field\r\nof the chapters following, but, more important and fundamental still\r\nthan all the facts discovered and the phenomena investigated has been\r\nthe establishment of certain broad scientific principles which have\r\nrevolutionized modern thought and shown the relation between sciences\r\nseemingly independent. The law of conservation of energy in the physical\r\nworld and the principle of material and organic evolution may well be\r\nsaid to be the greatest generalizations of the human mind. Although\r\nsuggestions in regard to them, particularly the latter, are to be found\r\nin the writings of early authors, the establishment and general\r\nacceptance of these principles belong properly to the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century. They stand as the crowning achievement of the\r\nscientific thought of the period in which we are interested.\r\n\r\nAny mere enumeration of the vast fund of knowledge accumulated by the\r\nefforts of man through observation and experiment in the period in which\r\nwe are interested would be a dry summary, and yet would give some\r\nmeasure of what this marvelous period has accomplished. As in geography,\r\nman’s energy has in recent years removed the reproach of a “Dark\r\nContinent,” of “unexplored” central Asia and the once “inaccessible\r\npolar regions,” so in the different departments of science, he has\r\nopened up many unknown fields and accumulated vast stores of knowledge.\r\nIt might even seem as if the limit of the unknown were being approached.\r\nThere remains, however, this difference in the analogy, that in science\r\nthe fundamental relations—as, for example, the nature of gravitation, of\r\nmatter, of energy, of electricity; the actual nature and source of\r\nlife—the solution of these and other similar problems still lies in the\r\nfuture. What the result of continued research may be no one can predict,\r\nbut even with these possibilities before us, it is hardly rash to say\r\nthat so great a combined progress of pure and applied science as that of\r\nthe past hundred years is not likely to be again realized.\r\n\r\n\r\n              _Scientific Periodical Literature in 1818._\r\n\r\nThe contrast in scientific activity between 1818 and 1918 is nowhere\r\nmore strikingly shown than in the amount of scientific periodical\r\nliterature of the two periods. Of the thousands of scientific journals\r\nand regular publications by scientific societies and academies to-day,\r\nbut a very small number have carried on a continuous and practically\r\nunbroken existence since 1818. This small amount of periodical\r\nscientific literature in the early part of the last century is\r\nsignificant as giving a fair indication of the very limited extent to\r\nwhich scientific investigation appealed to the intellectual life of the\r\ntime. Some definite facts in regard to the scientific publications of\r\nthose early days seem to be called for.\r\n\r\nLearned societies and academies, devoted to literature and science, were\r\nformed very early but at first for occasional meetings only and regular\r\npublications were in most cases not begun till a very much later date.\r\nSome of the earliest—not to go back of the Renaissance—are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1560. Naples, Academia Secretorum Naturæ.\r\n\r\n  1603. Rome, Accademia dei Lincei.\r\n\r\n  1651. Leipzig, Academia Naturæ Curiosum.\r\n\r\n  1657. Florence, Accademia del Cimento.\r\n\r\n  1662. London, Royal Society.\r\n\r\n  1666. Paris, Académie des Sciences.\r\n\r\n  1690. Bologna, Accademia delle Scienze.\r\n\r\n  1700. Berlin, Societas Regia Scientiarum. This was the forerunner of\r\n  the K. preuss. Akad. d. Wissenschaften.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Royal Society of London, whose existence dates from 1645, though not\r\ndefinitely chartered until 1662, began the publication of its\r\n“Philosophical Transactions” in 1665 and has continued it practically\r\nunbroken to the present time; this is a unique record. Following this,\r\nother early—but in most cases not continuous—publications were those of\r\nParis (1699); Berlin (1710); Upsala (1720); Petrograd, 1728; Stockholm\r\n(1739); and Copenhagen (1743).\r\n\r\nFor the latter half of the eighteenth century, when the foundations of\r\nour modern science were being rapidly laid, a considerable list might be\r\ngiven of early publications of similar scientific bodies. Some of the\r\nprominent ones are: Göttingen (1750), Munich (1759), Brussels (1769),\r\nPrague (1775), Turin (1784), Dublin (1788), etc. The early years of the\r\nnineteenth century saw the beginnings of many others, particularly in\r\nnorthern Italy. It is to be noted that, as stated, only rarely were the\r\npublications of these learned societies even approximately continuous.\r\nIn the majority of cases the issue of transactions or proceedings was\r\nhighly irregular and often interrupted.\r\n\r\nIn this country the earliest scientific bodies are the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Philadelphia. American Philosophical Society, founded in 1743.\r\n  Transactions were published 1771–1809; then interrupted until 1818 _et\r\n  seq._\r\n\r\n  Boston. American Academy of Arts and Sciences, founded in 1780.\r\n  Memoirs, 1785–1821; and then 1833 _et seq._\r\n\r\n  New Haven. Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, begun in 1799.\r\n  Memoirs, vol. 1, 1810–16; Transactions, 1866 _et seq._\r\n\r\n  Philadelphia. Academy of Natural Sciences, begun in 1812. Journal,\r\n  1817–1842; and from 1847 _et seq._\r\n\r\n  New York. Lyceum of Natural History, 1817; later (1876) became the New\r\n  York Academy of Sciences. Annals from 1823; Proceedings from 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe situation is somewhat similar as to independent scientific journals.\r\nA list of the names of those started only to find an early death would\r\nbe a very long one, but interesting only historically and as showing a\r\nspasmodic but unsustained striving after scientific growth.\r\n\r\nIt seems worth while, however, to give here the names of the periodicals\r\nembracing one or more of the subjects of the American Journal, which\r\nbegan at a very early date and most of which have maintained an\r\nuninterrupted existence down to 1915. It should be added that certain\r\nmedical journals, not listed here, have also had a long and continued\r\nexistence.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Early Scientific Journals._\r\n\r\n\r\n  1771–1823.

It was necessary, not only to\r\nobtain the material to fill its pages and the money to carry on the\r\nenterprise, but, before the latter end could be accomplished, an\r\naudience must be found among those who had hitherto felt little or no\r\ninterest in the sciences. This great work was accomplished by Benjamin\r\nSilliman, “the guardian of American Science,” whose influence was second\r\nto none in the early development of science in this country. Before\r\nspeaking in some detail of the early years of this Journal and of its\r\nsubsequent history, it is proper that some words should be given to its\r\nfounder.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Silliman, son of a general prominent in the Revolutionary War,\r\nwas born in Trumbull, Connecticut, on August 8, 1779. He was a graduate\r\nof Yale College of the class of 1796. Though at first a student of law\r\nand accepted for the bar in Connecticut, he was called in 1802 by\r\nPresident Timothy Dwight—a man of rare breadth of mind—to occupy the\r\nnewly made chair of chemistry, mineralogy (and later geology) in Yale\r\nCollege at New Haven. To fit himself for the work before him he carried\r\non extensive studies at home and in Philadelphia and spent the year 1805\r\nin travels and study at London and Edinburgh, and also on the Continent.\r\nHis active duties began in 1806 and from this time on he was in the\r\nservice of Yale College until his resignation in 1853. From the first,\r\nSilliman met with remarkable success as a teacher and public lecturer in\r\narousing an interest in science. His breadth of knowledge, his\r\nenthusiasm for his chosen subjects and power of clear presentation,\r\ncombined with his fine presence and attractive personality, made him a\r\ngreat leader in the science of the country and gave him a unique\r\nposition in the history of its development.\r\n\r\nMuch might be said of the man and his work, but, the best tribute is\r\nthat of James Dwight Dana, given in his inaugural address upon the\r\noccasion of his beginning his duties as Silliman professor of geology in\r\nYale College. This was delivered on February 18, 1856, in what was then\r\nknown as the “Cabinet Building.” Dana says in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “In entering upon the duties of this place, my thoughts turn rather to\r\n  the past than to the subject of the present hour. I feel that it is an\r\n  honored place, honored by the labors of one who has been the guardian\r\n  of American Science from its childhood; who here first opened to the\r\n  country the wonderful records of geology; whose words of eloquence and\r\n  earnest truth were but the overflow of a soul full of noble sentiments\r\n  and warm sympathies, the whole throwing a peculiar charm over his\r\n  learning, and rendering his name beloved as well as illustrious. Just\r\n  fifty years since, Professor Silliman took his station at the head of\r\n  chemical and geological science in this college. Geology was then\r\n  hardly known by name in the land, out of these walls. Two years\r\n  before, previous to his tour in Europe, the whole cabinet of Yale was\r\n  a half-bushel of unlabelled stones. On visiting England he found even\r\n  in London no school public or private, for geological instruction, and\r\n  the science was not named in the English universities. To the mines,\r\n  quarries, and cliffs of England, the crags of Scotland, and the\r\n  meadows of Holland he looked for knowledge, and from these and the\r\n  teachings of Murray, Jameson, Hall, Hope, and Playfair, at Edinburgh,\r\n  Professor Silliman returned, equipped for duty,—albeit a great\r\n  duty,—that of laying the foundation, and creating almost out of\r\n  nothing a department not before recognized in any institution in\r\n  America.\r\n\r\n  He began his work in 1806. The science was without books—and, too,\r\n  without system, except such as its few cultivators had each for\r\n  himself in his conceptions. It was the age of the first beginnings of\r\n  geology, when Wernerians and Huttonians were arrayed in a contest....\r\n  Professor Silliman when at Edinburgh witnessed the strife, and while,\r\n  as he says, his earliest predilections were for the more peaceful mode\r\n  of rock-making, these soon yielded to the accumulating evidence, and\r\n  both views became combined in his mind in one harmonious whole. The\r\n  science, thus evolved, grew with him and by him; for his own labors\r\n  contributed to its extension. Every year was a year of expansion and\r\n  onward development, and the grandeur of the opening views found in him\r\n  a ready and appreciative response....\r\n\r\n  And while the sciences and truth have thus made progress here, through\r\n  these labors of fifty years, the means of study in the institution\r\n  have no less increased. Instead of that half-bushel of stones, which\r\n  once went to Philadelphia for names, in a candle-box, you see above\r\n  the largest mineral cabinet in the country, which but for Professor\r\n  Silliman, his attractions and his personal exertions together, would\r\n  never have been one of the glories of old Yale....\r\n\r\n  Moreover, the American Journal of Science,—now in its thirty-seventh\r\n  year and seventieth volume [1856],—projected and long-sustained solely\r\n  by Professor Silliman, while ever distributing truth, has also been\r\n  ever gathering honors, and is one of the laurels of Yale.\r\n\r\n  We rejoice that in laying aside his studies, after so many years of\r\n  labor, there is still no abated vigor.... He retires as one whose\r\n  right it is to throw the burden on others. Long may he be with us, to\r\n  enjoy the good he has done, and cheer us by his noble and benign\r\n  presence.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to these words of Dana, much of vital interest in regard to\r\nSilliman and his work will be gathered from what is given in the pages\r\nimmediately following, quoted from his personal statements in the early\r\nvolumes of the Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _The Early Years of the Journal._\r\n\r\nIn no direction did Silliman’s enthusiastic activities in science\r\nproduce a more enduring result than in the founding and carrying on of\r\nthe Journal. The first suggestion in regard to the enterprise was made\r\nto Silliman by his friend, Colonel George Gibbs, from whom the famous\r\nGibbs collection of minerals was bought by Yale College in 1825.\r\nSilliman says (=25=, 215, 1834):\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE, MORE ESPECIALLY OF\r\n_MINERALOGY_, _GEOLOGY_, AND THE OTHER BRANCHES OF NATURAL HISTORY;\r\nINCLUDING ALSO _AGRICULTURE_ AND THE ORNAMENTAL AS WELL AS USEFUL ARTS.\r\nCONDUCTED BY _BENJAMIN SILLIMAN_, PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY, MINERALOGY,\r\nETC.

Gibbs was the person who first suggested to the Editor the\r\n  project of this Journal, and he urged the topic with so much zeal and\r\n  with such cogent arguments, as prevailed to induce the effort in a\r\n  case then viewed as of very dubious success. The subject was thus\r\n  started in November, 1817; proposals for the Journal were issued in\r\n  January, 1818, and the first number appeared in July of that year.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHe adds further (=50=, p. iii, 1847) that the conversation here recorded\r\ntook place “on an accidental meeting on board the steamboat Fulton in\r\nLong Island Sound.” This was some ten years after Robert Fulton’s\r\nsteamboat, the Clermont, made its pioneer trip on the Hudson river,\r\nalready alluded to. The incident is not without significance in this\r\nconnection. The deck of the “Fulton” was not an inappropriate place for\r\nthe inauguration of an enterprise also great in its results for the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn the preface to the concluding volume of the First Series (loc. cit.)\r\nSilliman adds the following remarks which show his natural modesty at\r\nthe thought of undertaking so serious a work. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Although a different selection of an editor would have been much\r\n  preferred, and many reasons, public and personal, concurred to produce\r\n  diffidence of success, the arguments of Col. Gibbs, whose views on\r\n  subjects of science were entitled to the most respectful\r\n  consideration, and had justly great weight, being pressed with zeal\r\n  and ability, induced a reluctant assent; and accordingly, after due\r\n  consultation with many competent judges, the proposals were issued\r\n  early in 1818, embracing the whole range of physical science and its\r\n  applications. The Editor in entering on the duty, regarded it as an\r\n  affair for life, and the thirty years of experience which he has now\r\n  had, have proved that his views of the exigencies of the service were\r\n  not erroneous.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plan with which the editor began his work and the lines laid down by\r\nhim at the outset can only be made clear by quoting entire the “Plan of\r\nthe Work” which opens the first number. It seems desirable also to give\r\nthis in its original form as to paragraphs and typography. The first\r\npage of the cover of the opening number has also been reproduced here.\r\nIt will be seen that the plan of the young editor was as wide as the\r\nentire range of science and its applications and extended out to music\r\nand the fine arts. This seems strange to-day, but it must be remembered\r\nhow few were the organs of publication open to contributors at the time.\r\nIf the plan was unreasonably extended, that fact is to be taken not only\r\nas an expression of the enthusiasm of the editor, as yet inexperienced\r\nin his work, but also of the time when the sciences were still in their\r\ninfancy.\r\n\r\nHe says (=1=, pp. v, vi):\r\n\r\n\r\n                           “PLAN OF THE WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This Journal is intended to embrace the circle of THE PHYSICAL\r\n  SCIENCES, with their application to THE ARTS, and to every useful\r\n  purpose.\r\n\r\n  It is designed as a deposit for _original American communications_;\r\n  but will contain also occasional selections from Foreign Journals, and\r\n  notices of the progress of science in other countries. Within its plan\r\n  are embraced\r\n\r\n  NATURAL HISTORY, in its three great departments of MINERALOGY, BOTANY,\r\n  and ZOOLOGY;\r\n\r\n  CHEMISTRY and NATURAL PHILOSOPHY, in their various branches: and\r\n  MATHEMATICS, pure and mixed.\r\n\r\n  It will be a leading object to illustrate AMERICAN NATURAL HISTORY,\r\n  and especially our MINERALOGY and GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n  The APPLICATIONS of these sciences are obviously as numerous as\r\n  _physical arts_, and _physical wants_; for no one of these arts or\r\n  wants can be named which is not connected with them.\r\n\r\n  While SCIENCE will be cherished _for its own sake_, and with a due\r\n  respect for its own _inherent_ dignity; it will also be employed as\r\n  the _handmaid to the Arts_. Its numerous applications to AGRICULTURE,\r\n  the earliest and most important of them; to our MANUFACTURES, both\r\n  mechanical and chemical; and to our DOMESTIC ECONOMY, will be\r\n  carefully sought out, and faithfully made.\r\n\r\n  It is also within the design of this Journal to receive communications\r\n  on MUSIC, SCULPTURE, ENGRAVING, PAINTING, and generally on the fine\r\n  and liberal, as well as useful arts;\r\n\r\n  On Military and Civil Engineering, and the art of Navigation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Very truly Yours, B. Silliman]\r\n\r\n  Notices, Reviews, and Analyses of new scientific works, and of new\r\n  Inventions, and Specifications of Patents;\r\n\r\n  Biographical and Obituary Notices of scientific men; essays on\r\n  COMPARATIVE ANATOMY and PHYSIOLOGY, and generally on such other\r\n  branches of medicine as depend on scientific principles;\r\n\r\n  Meteorological Registers, and Reports of Agricultural Experiments: and\r\n  we would leave room also for interesting miscellaneous things, not\r\n  perhaps exactly included under either of the above heads.\r\n\r\n  Communications are respectfully solicited from men of science, and\r\n  _from men versed in the practical arts_.\r\n\r\n  Learned Societies are invited to make this Journal, occasionally, the\r\n  vehicle of their communications to the Public.\r\n\r\n  The editor will not hold himself responsible for the sentiments and\r\n  opinions advanced by his correspondents; but he will consider it as an\r\n  allowed liberty to make slight _verbal alterations_, where errors may\r\n  be presumed to have arisen from inadvertency.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the “Advertisement” which precedes the above statement in the first\r\nnumber, the editor remarks somewhat naïvely that he “does not pledge\r\nhimself that all the subjects shall be touched upon in every number.\r\nThis is plainly impossible unless every article should be very short and\r\nimperfect....”\r\n\r\nThe whole subject is discussed in all its relations in the “Introductory\r\nRemarks” which open the first volume. No apology is needed for quoting\r\nat considerable length, for only in this way can the situation be made\r\nclear, as seen by the editor in 1818. Further we gain here a picture of\r\nthe intellectual life of the times and, not less interesting, of the\r\nmind and personality of the writer. With a frank kindliness, eminently\r\ncharacteristic of the man, as will be seen, he takes the public fully\r\ninto his confidence. In the remarks made in subsequent volumes,—also\r\nextensively quoted—the vicissitudes in the conduct of the enterprise are\r\nbrought out and when success was no longer doubtful, there is a tone of\r\nquiet satisfaction which was also characteristic and which the\r\ncircumstances fully justified.\r\n\r\nThe INTRODUCTORY REMARKS begin as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The age in which we live is not less distinguished by a vigorous and\r\n  successful cultivation of physical science, than by its numerous and\r\n  important applications to the practical arts, and to the common\r\n  purposes of life.\r\n\r\n  In every enlightened country, men illustrious for talent, worth and\r\n  knowledge, are ardently engaged in enlarging the boundaries of natural\r\n  science; and the history of their labors and discoveries is\r\n  communicated to the world chiefly through the medium of scientific\r\n  journals. The utility of such journals has thus become generally\r\n  evident; they are the heralds of science; they proclaim its toils and\r\n  its achievements; they demonstrate its intimate connection as well\r\n  with the comfort, as with the intellectual and moral improvement of\r\n  our species; and they often procure for it enviable honors and\r\n  substantial rewards.\r\n\r\n\r\nMention is then made of the journals existing in England and France in\r\n1818 “which have long enjoyed a high and deserved reputation.” He then\r\ncontinues:\r\n\r\n\r\n  From these sources our country reaps and will long continue to reap,\r\n  an abundant harvest of information: and if the light of science, as\r\n  well as of day, springs from the East, we will welcome the rays of\r\n  both; nor should national pride induce us to reject so rich an\r\n  offering.\r\n\r\n  But can we do nothing in return?\r\n\r\n  In a general diffusion of useful information through the various\r\n  classes of society, in activity of intellect and fertility of resource\r\n  and invention, producing a highly intelligent population, we have no\r\n  reason to shrink from a comparison with any country. But the devoted\r\n  cultivators of science in the United States are comparatively few:\r\n  they are, however, rapidly increasing in number. Among them are\r\n  persons distinguished for their capacity and attainments, and,\r\n  notwithstanding the local feelings nourished by our state\r\n  sovereignties, and the rival claims of several of our larger cities,\r\n  there is evidently a predisposition towards a concentration of effort,\r\n  from which we may hope for the happiest results, with regard to the\r\n  advancement of both the science and reputation of our country.\r\n\r\n  Is it not, therefore, desirable to furnish some rallying point, some\r\n  object sufficiently interesting to be nurtured by common efforts, and\r\n  thus to become the basis of an enduring, common interest? To produce\r\n  these efforts, and to excite this interest, nothing, perhaps, bids\r\n  fairer than a SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe valuable work already accomplished by various medical journals is\r\nthen spoken of and particularly that of the first scientific periodical\r\nin the United States, Bruce’s Mineralogical Journal. This, as Silliman\r\nsays (=1=, p. 3, 1818), although “both in this country and in Europe\r\nreceived in a very flattering manner,” did not survive the death of its\r\nfounder, and only a single volume of 270 pages appeared (1810–1813).\r\n\r\nSilliman continues:\r\n\r\n\r\n  No one, it is presumed, will doubt that a journal devoted to science,\r\n  and embracing a sphere sufficiently extensive to allure to its support\r\n  the principal scientific men of our country, is greatly needed; if\r\n  cordially supported, it will be successful, and if successful, it will\r\n  be a great public benefit.\r\n\r\n  Even a failure, in so good a cause, (unless it should arise from\r\n  incapacity or unfaithfulness,) cannot be regarded as dishonourable. It\r\n  may prove only that the attempt was premature, and that our country is\r\n  not yet ripe for such an undertaking; for without the efficient\r\n  support of talent, knowledge, and money, it cannot long proceed. No\r\n  editor can hope to carry forward such a work without the active aid of\r\n  scientific and practical men; but, at the same time, the public have a\r\n  right to expect that he will not be sparing of his own labour, and\r\n  that his work shall be generally marked by the impress of his own\r\n  hand. To this extent the editor cheerfully acknowledges his\r\n  obligations to the public; and it will be his endeavour faithfully to\r\n  redeem his pledge.\r\n\r\n  Most of the periodical works of our country have been short-lived.\r\n  This, also, may perish in its infancy; and if any degree of confidence\r\n  is cherished that it will attain a maturer age, it is derived from the\r\n  obvious and intrinsic importance of the undertaking; from its being\r\n  built upon permanent and momentous national interests; from the\r\n  evidence of a decided approbation of the design, on the part of\r\n  gentlemen of the first eminence, obtained in the progress of an\r\n  extensive correspondence; from assurance of support, in the way of\r\n  contributions, from men of ability in many sections of the union; and\r\n  from the existence of such a crisis in the affairs of this country and\r\n  of the world, as appears peculiarly auspicious to the success of every\r\n  wise and good undertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interesting discussion follows (pp. 5–8) as to the claims of the\r\ndifferent branches of science, and the extent to which they and their\r\napplications had been already developed, also the spheres still open to\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nThe Introductory Remarks close, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  In a word, the whole circle of physical science is directly applicable\r\n  to human wants and constantly holds out a light to the practical arts;\r\n  it thus polishes and benefits society and everywhere demonstrates both\r\n  supreme intelligence and harmony and beneficence of design in the\r\n  Creator.\r\n\r\n  The science of mathematics, both pure and mixed, can never cease to be\r\n  interesting and important to man, as long as the relations of quantity\r\n  shall exist, as long as ships shall traverse the ocean, as long as man\r\n  shall measure the surface or heights of the earth on which he lives,\r\n  or calculate the distances and examine the relations of the planets\r\n  and stars; and as long as the _iron reign of war_ shall demand the\r\n  discharge of projectiles, or the construction of complicated defences.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe closing part of the paragraph shows the influence exerted upon the\r\nmind of the editor by the serious wars of the years preceding 1818, a\r\nsubject alluded to again at the close of this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn February, 1822, with the completion of the fourth volume, the editor\r\nreviews the situation which, though encouraging is by no means fully\r\nassuring. He says (preface to vol. =4=, dated Feb. 15, 1822):\r\n\r\n\r\n  Two years and a half have elapsed, since the publication of the first\r\n  volume of this Journal, and one year and ten months since the Editor\r\n  assumed the pecuniary responsibility....\r\n\r\n  The work has not, even yet, reimbursed its expenses, (we speak not of\r\n  editorial or of business compensation,) we intend, that it has not\r\n  paid for the paper, printing and engraving; the proprietors of the\r\n  first volume being in advance, on those accounts, and the Editor on\r\n  the same score, with respect to the aggregate expense of the three\r\n  last volumes. This deficit is, however, no longer increasing, as the\r\n  receipts, at present, just about cover the expense of the physical\r\n  materials, and of the manual labour. A reiterated disclosure of this\r\n  kind is not grateful, and would scarcely be manly, were it not that\r\n  the public, who alone have the power to remove the difficulty, have a\r\n  right to a frank exposition of the state of the case. As the patronage\r\n  is, however, growing gradually more extensive, it is believed that the\r\n  work will be eventually sustained, although it may be long before it\r\n  will command any thing but gratuitous intellectual labour....\r\n\r\n  These facts, with the obvious one,—that its pages are supplied with\r\n  contributions from all parts of the Union, and occasionally from\r\n  Europe, evince that the work is received as a national and not as a\r\n  local undertaking, and that the community consider it as having no\r\n  sectional character. Encouraged by this view of the subject, and by\r\n  the favour of many distinguished men, both at home and abroad, and\r\n  supported by able contributors, to whom the Editor again tenders his\r\n  grateful acknowledgments, he will still persevere, in the hope of\r\n  contributing something to the advancement of our science and arts, and\r\n  towards the elevation of our national character.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of the same year, the editor closes the fifth volume with\r\na more confident tone (Sept. 25, 1822):\r\n\r\n\r\n  A trial of four years has decided the point, that the American Public\r\n  will support this Journal. Its pecuniary patronage is now such, that\r\n  although not a lucrative, it is no longer a hazardous enterprise. It\r\n  is now also decided, that the intellectual resources of the country\r\n  are sufficient to afford an unfailing supply of valuable original\r\n  communications and that nothing but perseverance and effort are\r\n  necessary to give perpetuity to the undertaking.\r\n\r\n  The decided and uniform expression of public favour which the Journal\r\n  has received both at home and abroad, affords the Editor such\r\n  encouragement, that he cannot hesitate to persevere—and he now renews\r\n  the expression of his thanks to the friends and correspondents of the\r\n  work, both in Europe and the United States, requesting at the same\r\n  time a continuance of their friendly influence and efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\nStill again in the preface to the sixth volume (1823) he takes the\r\nreader more fully into his confidence and shows that he regards the\r\nenterprise as no longer of doubtful success. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The conclusion of a new volume of a work, involving so much care,\r\n  labour and responsibility, as are necessarily attached, at the present\r\n  day, to a Journal of Science and the Arts, naturally produces in the\r\n  mind, a state of not ungrateful calmness, and a disposition, partaking\r\n  of social feeling, to say something to those who honour such a\r\n  production, by giving to it a small share of their money, and of their\r\n  time. The Editor’s first impression was, that the sixth volume should\r\n  be sent into the world without an introductory note, but he yields to\r\n  the impulse already expressed, and to the established usages of\r\n  respectful courtesy to the public, which a short preface seems to\r\n  imply. He has now persevered almost five years, in an undertaking,\r\n  regarded by many of the friends whom he originally consulted, as\r\n  hazardous, and to which not a few of them prophetically alloted only\r\n  an ephemeral existence. It has been his fortune to prosecute this work\r\n  without, (till a very recent period,) returns, adequate to its\r\n  indispensable responsibilities;—under a heavy pressure of professional\r\n  and private duty; with trying fluctuations of health, and amidst\r\n  severe and reiterated domestic afflictions. The world are usually\r\n  indulgent to allusions of this nature, when they have any relation to\r\n  the discharge of public duty; and in this view, it is with\r\n  satisfaction, that the Editor adds, that he has now to look on\r\n  formidable difficulties, only in retrospect, and with something of the\r\n  feeling of him, who sees a powerful and vanquished foe, slowly\r\n  retiring, and leaving a field no longer contested.\r\n\r\n  This Journal which, from the first, was fully supplied with original\r\n  communications, is now sustained by actual payment, to such an extent,\r\n  that it may fairly be considered as an established work; its patronage\r\n  is regularly increasing, and we trust it will no longer justify such\r\n  remarks as some of the following, from the pen of one of the most\r\n  eminent scientific men in Europe. “Nothing surprises me more, than the\r\n  little encouragement which your Journal,” (“which I always read with\r\n  very great interest, and of which I make great use,”) “experiences in\r\n  America—this must surely arise from the present depressed condition of\r\n  trade, and cannot long continue.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSix years more of uninterrupted editorial work passed by, the sixteenth\r\nvolume was completed, and the editor was now in a position to review the\r\nwhole situation up to 1829. This preface (dated July 1, 1829), which is\r\nquoted nearly in full, cannot fail to be found particularly interesting\r\nand from several standpoints, not the least for the insight it gives\r\ninto the writer’s mind. It is also noteworthy that at this early date it\r\nwas found possible to pay for original contributions, a privilege far\r\nbeyond the means of the editor of to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When this Journal was first projected, very few believed that it would\r\n  succeed.\r\n\r\n  Among others, Dr. Dorsey wrote to the editor; “I predict a short life\r\n  for you, although I wish, as the Spaniards say, that you may live a\r\n  thousand years.” The work has not lived a thousand years, but as it\r\n  has survived more than the hundredth part of that period, no reason is\r\n  apparent why it may not continue to exist. To the contributors,\r\n  disinterested and arduous as have been their exertions, the editor’s\r\n  warmest thanks are due; and they are equally rendered to numerous\r\n  personal friends for their unwavering support: nor ought those\r\n  subscribers to be forgotten who, occupied in the common pursuits of\r\n  life, have aided, by their money, in sustaining the hazardous novelty\r\n  of an American Journal of Science. A general approbation, sufficiently\r\n  decided to encourage effort, where there was no other reward, has\r\n  supported the editor; but he has not been inattentive to the voice of\r\n  criticism, whether it has reached him in the tones of candor and\r\n  kindness, or in those of severity. We must not look to our friends for\r\n  the full picture of our faults. He is unwise who neglects the maxim—\r\n\r\n                        —fas est ab hoste doceri,\r\n\r\n  and we may be sure, that those are quite in earnest, whose pleasure it\r\n  is, to place faults in a strong light and bold relief; and to throw\r\n  excellencies into the shadow of total eclipse. Minds at once\r\n  enlightened and amiable, viewing both in their proper proportions,\r\n  will however render the equitable verdict;\r\n\r\n                    Non ego paucis offendar maculis,—\r\n\r\n  It is not pretended that this Journal has been faultless; there may be\r\n  communications in it which had been better omitted, and it is not\r\n  doubted that the power to command intellectual effort, by suitable\r\n  pecuniary reward, would add to its purity, as a record of science, and\r\n  to its richness, as a repository of discoveries in the arts.\r\n\r\n  But the editor, even now, offers payment, at the rate adopted by the\r\n  literary Journals, for able original communications, containing\r\n  especially important facts, investigations and discoveries in science,\r\n  and practical inventions in the useful and ornamental Arts.\r\n\r\n  As however his means are insufficient to pay for all the copy, it is\r\n  earnestly requested, that those gentlemen, who, from other motives,\r\n  are still willing to write for this Journal, should continue to favor\r\n  it with their communications. That the period when satisfactory\r\n  compensation can be made to all writers whose pieces are inserted, and\r\n  to whom payment will be acceptable, is not distant, may perhaps be\r\n  hoped, from the spontaneous expression of the following opinion, by\r\n  the distinguished editor of one of our principal literary journals,\r\n  whose letter is now before me. “The character of the American Journal\r\n  is strictly national, and it is the only vehicle of communication in\r\n  which an inquirer may be sure to find what is most interesting in the\r\n  wide range of topics, which its design embraces. It has become in\r\n  short, not more identified with the science than the literature of the\r\n  country.” It is believed that a strict examination of its contents\r\n  will prove that its character has been decidedly scientific; and the\r\n  opinion is often expressed to the editor, that in common with the\r\n  journals of our Academies, it is a work of reference, indispensable to\r\n  him who would examine the progress of American science during the\r\n  period which it covers. That it might not be too repulsive to the\r\n  general reader, some miscellaneous pieces have occasionally occupied\r\n  its pages; but in smaller proportion, than is common with several of\r\n  the most distinguished British Journals of Science.\r\n\r\n  Still, the editor has been frequently solicited, both in public and\r\n  private, to make it more miscellaneous, that it might be more\r\n  acceptable to the intelligent and well educated man, who does not\r\n  cultivate science; but he has never lost sight of his great object,\r\n  which was to produce and concentrate original American effort in\r\n  science, and thus he has foregone pecuniary returns, which by pursuing\r\n  the other course, might have been rendered important. Others would not\r\n  have him admit any thing that is not strictly and technically\r\n  scientific; and would make this journal for mere professors and\r\n  amateurs; especially in regard to those numerous details in natural\r\n  history, which although important to be registered, (and which, when\r\n  presented, have always been recorded in the American Journal,) can\r\n  never exclusively occupy the pages of any such work without repelling\r\n  the majority of readers.\r\n\r\n  If this is true even in Great Britain it is still more so in this\r\n  country; and our savants, unless they would be, not only the exclusive\r\n  admirers, but the sole purchasers of their own works, must permit a\r\n  little of the graceful drapery of general literature to flow around\r\n  the cold statues of science. The editor of this Journal, strongly\r\n  inclined, both from opinion and habit, to gratify the cultivators of\r\n  science, will still do everything in his power to promote its high\r\n  interests, and as he hopes in a better manner than heretofore; but\r\n  these respectable gentlemen will have the courtesy, to yield something\r\n  to the reading literary, as well as scientific public, and will not,\r\n  we trust, be disgusted, if now and then an _Oasis_ relieves the eye,\r\n  and a living stream refreshes the traveller. Not being inclined to\r\n  renew the abortive experiment, to please every body, which has been so\r\n  long renowned in fable; the editor will endeavor to pursue, the even\r\n  tenor of his way; altogther inclined to be courteous and useful to his\r\n  fellow travellers, and hoping for their kindness and services in\r\n  return.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _The Close of the First Series._\r\n\r\nThe “First Series,” as it was henceforth to be known, closed with the\r\nfiftieth volume (1847, pp. xx + 347). This final volume is devoted to an\r\nexhaustive index to the forty-nine volumes preceding. In the preface\r\n(dated April 19, 1847) the elder Silliman, now the senior editor,\r\nreviews the work that had been accomplished with a frank expression of\r\nhis feeling of satisfaction in the victory won against great obstacles;\r\nwith this every reader must sympathize. He quotes here at length (but in\r\nslightly altered form) the matter from the first volume (1818), which\r\nhas been already reproduced almost entire, and then goes on as follows\r\n(pp. xi _et seq._):\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James D. Dana]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Such was the pledge which, on entering upon our editorial labors in\r\n  1818, we gave to the public, and such were the views which we then\r\n  entertained, regarding science and the arts as connected with the\r\n  interests and honor of our country and of mankind. In the retrospect,\r\n  we realize a sober but grateful feeling of satisfaction, in having, to\r\n  the extent of our power, discharged these self-imposed obligations;\r\n  this feeling is chastened also by a deep sense of gratitude, first to\r\n  God for life and power continued for so high a purpose; and next, to\r\n  our noble band of contributors, whose labors are recorded in half a\r\n  century of volumes, and in more than a quarter of a century of years.\r\n  We need not conceal our conviction, that the views expressed in these\r\n  “Introductory Remarks,” have been fully sustained by our fellow\r\n  laborers.\r\n\r\n  Should we appear to take higher ground than becomes us, we find our\r\n  vindication in the fact, that we have heralded chiefly the doings and\r\n  the fame of others. The work has indeed borne throughout “the impress”\r\n  of editorial unity of design, and much that has flowed from one pen,\r\n  and not a little from the pens of others, has been without a name. The\r\n  materials for the pile, have however been selected and brought in,\r\n  chiefly by other hands, and if the monument which has been reared\r\n  should prove to be “_aere perennius_,” the honor is not the sole\r\n  property of the architect; those who have quarried, hewn and polished\r\n  the granite and the marble, are fully entitled to the enduring record\r\n  of their names already deeply cut into the massy blocks, which\r\n  themselves have furnished.\r\n\r\n  If a retrospective survey of the labors of thirty years on this\r\n  occasion has rekindled a degree of enthusiasm, it is a natural result\r\n  of an examination of all our volumes from the contents of which we\r\n  have endeavored to make out a summary both of the laborers and their\r\n  works....\r\n\r\n  The series of volumes must ever form a work of permanent interest on\r\n  account of its exhibiting the progress of American science during the\r\n  long period which it covers. Comparing 1817 with 1847, we mark on this\r\n  subject a very gratifying change. The cultivators of science in the\r\n  United States were then few—now they are numerous. Societies and\r\n  associations of various names, for the cultivation of natural history,\r\n  have been instituted in very many of our cities and towns, and several\r\n  of them have been active and efficient in making original observations\r\n  and forming collections.\r\n\r\n\r\nA summary follows presenting some facts as to the growth of scientific\r\nsocieties and scientific collections in this country during the period\r\ninvolved: Then the striking contrast between 1818 and 1847 in the matter\r\nof organized effort toward scientific exploration is discussed, as\r\nfollows (pp. xvi _et seq._):\r\n\r\n\r\n  When we began our Journal, not one of the States had been surveyed in\r\n  relation to its geology and natural history; now those that have not\r\n  been explored are few in number. State collections and a United States\r\n  Museum hold forth many allurements to the young naturalist, as well as\r\n  to the archaeologist and the student of his own race. The late\r\n  Exploring Expedition [Wilkes] with the National Institute, has\r\n  enriched the capital with treasures rarely equalled in any country,\r\n  and the Smithsonian Institution recently organized at Washington, is\r\n  about to begin its labors for the increase and diffusion of knowledge\r\n  among men.\r\n\r\n  It must not be forgotten that the American Association of Geologists\r\n  and Naturalists—composed of individuals assembled from widely separate\r\n  portions of the Union—by the seven sessions which it has held, and by\r\n  its rich volume of reports, has produced a concentration and harmony\r\n  of effort which promise happy results, especially as, like the British\r\n  Association, it visits different towns and cities in its annual\r\n  progress.\r\n\r\n  Astronomy now lifts its exploring tubes from the observatories of many\r\n  of our institutions. Even the Ohio, which within the memory of the\r\n  oldest living men, rolled along its dark waters through interminable\r\n  forests, or received the stains of blood from deadly Indian warfare,\r\n  now beholds on one of its most beautiful hills, and near its splendid\r\n  city, a permanent observatory with a noble telescope sweeping the\r\n  heavens, by the hand of a zealous and gifted observer. At Washington\r\n  also, under the powerful patronage of the general government, an\r\n  excellent observatory has been established, and is furnished with\r\n  superior instruments, under the direction of a vigilant and well\r\n  instructed astronomer—seconded by able and zealous assistants.\r\n\r\n  Here also (in Yale College) successful observations have been made\r\n  with good instruments, although no permanent building has been erected\r\n  for an Observatory.\r\n\r\n  We only give single examples by way of illustration, for the history\r\n  of the progress of science in the United States, and of institutions\r\n  for its promotion, during the present generation, would demand a\r\n  volume. It is enough for our purpose that science is understood and\r\n  valued, and the right methods of prosecuting it are known, and the\r\n  time is at hand when its moral and intellectual use will be as obvious\r\n  as its physical applications. Nor is it to be forgotten that we have\r\n  awakened an European interest in our researches: general science has\r\n  been illustrated by treasures of facts drawn from this country, and\r\n  our discoveries are eagerly sought for and published abroad.\r\n\r\n  While with our co-workers in many parts of our broad land, we rejoice\r\n  in this auspicious change, we are far from arrogating it to ourselves.\r\n  Multiplied labors of many hands have produced the great results. In\r\n  the place which we have occupied, we have persevered despite of all\r\n  discouragements, and may, with our numerous coadjutors, claim some\r\n  share in the honors of the day. We do not say that our work might not\r\n  have been better done—but we may declare with truth that we have done\r\n  all in our power, and it is something to have excited many others to\r\n  effort and to have chronicled their deeds in our annals. Let those\r\n  that follow us labor with like zeal and perseverance, and the good\r\n  cause will continue to advance and prosper. It is the cause of\r\n  truth—science is only embodied and sympathized truth and in the\r\n  beautiful conception of our noble Agassiz—“it tells the thought of\r\n  God.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preface closes with some personal remarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n  In tracing back the associations of many gone-by years, a host of\r\n  thoughts rush in, and pensive remembrance of the dead who have labored\r\n  with us casts deep shadows into the vista through which we view the\r\n  past.\r\n\r\n  Anticipation of the hour of discharge, when our summons shall arrive,\r\n  gives sobriety to thought and checks the confidence which health and\r\n  continued power to act might naturally inspire, were we not reproved,\r\n  almost every day, by the death of some co-eval, co-worker, companion,\r\n  friend or patron. This very hour is saddened by such an event,—but we\r\n  will continue to labor on, and strive to be found at our post of duty,\r\n  until there is nothing more for us to do; trusting our hopes for a\r\n  future life in the hands of Him who placed us in the midst of the\r\n  splendid garniture of this lower world, and who has made not less\r\n  ample provision for another and a better.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Editorial and financial._—The editorial labors on the Journal were\r\ncarried by the elder Silliman alone for twenty years from 1818 to 1838.\r\nAs has been clearly shown in his statements, already quoted, he was,\r\nafter the first beginning, personally responsible also for the financial\r\nside of the enterprise. With volume =34= (1838) the name of Benjamin\r\nSilliman, Jr., is added as co-editor on the title page. He was graduated\r\nfrom Yale College the year preceding and at this date was only\r\ntwenty-one years old. His aid was unquestionably of much service from\r\nthe beginning and increased rapidly with years and experience. The elder\r\nSilliman introduces him in the preface to vol. =34= (1838) and comes\r\nback to the subject again in the preface to vol. =50= (1847). The whole\r\neditorial situation is here presented as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “During twenty years from the inception of this Journal, the editor\r\n  labored alone, although overtures for editorial cooperation had been\r\n  made to him by gentlemen commanding his confidence and esteem, and who\r\n  would personally have been very acceptable. It was, however, his\r\n  opinion that the unity of purpose and action so essential to the\r\n  success of such a work were best secured by individuality; but he made\r\n  every effort, and not without success, to conciliate the good will and\r\n  to secure the assistance of gentlemen eminent in particular\r\n  departments of knowledge. On the title page of No. 1, vol. =34=,\r\n  published in July, 1838, a new name is introduced: the individual to\r\n  whom it belongs having been for several years more or less concerned\r\n  in the management of the Journal, and from his education, position,\r\n  pursuits and taste, as well as from affinity, being almost identified\r\n  with the editor, he seemed to be quite a natural ally, and his\r\n  adoption into the editorship was scarcely a violation of individual\r\n  unity. His assistance has proved to be very important:—his near\r\n  relation to the senior editor prevents him from saying more, while\r\n  justice does not permit him to say less.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAs is distinctly intimated in the preceding paragraph the elder Silliman\r\nwas fortunate in obtaining the assistance in his editorial labors of\r\nnumerous gentlemen interested in the enterprise. Their cooperation\r\nprovided many of the scientific notices, book reviews and the like\r\ncontained in the Miscellany with which each number closed. It is\r\nimpossible, at this date, to render the credit due to Silliman’s helpers\r\nor even to mention them by name. Very early Asa Gray was one of these as\r\noccasional notes are signed by his initials. Dr. Levi Ives of New Haven\r\nwas another. Prof. J. Griscom of Paris also sent numerous contributions\r\neven as early as 1825 (see =9=, 154, 1825; =22=, 192, 1832; =24=, 342,\r\n1833, and others).\r\n\r\nSome statements have already been quoted from the early volumes as to\r\nthe business part of Silliman’s enterprise. The subject is taken up more\r\nfully in the preface to volume =50= (1847). No one can fail to marvel at\r\nthe energy and optimism required to push the Journal forward when\r\nconditions must have been so difficult and encouragement so scanty. He\r\nsays (pp. iii, iv):\r\n\r\n\r\n  This Journal first appeared in July, 1818, and in June, 1819, the\r\n  first volume of four numbers and 448 pages was completed. This scale\r\n  of publication, originally deemed sufficient, was found inadequate to\r\n  receive all the communications, and as the receipts proved\r\n  insufficient to sustain the expenses, the work, having but three\r\n  hundred and fifty subscribers, was, at the end of the year, abandoned\r\n  by the publishers.\r\n\r\n  An unprofitable enterprise not being attractive to the trade, ten\r\n  months elapsed before another arrangement could be carried into\r\n  effect, and, therefore, No. 1 of vol. =2= was not published until\r\n  April, 1820. The new arrangement was one of mutual responsibility for\r\n  the expenses, but the Editor was constrained nevertheless to pledge\r\n  his own personal credit to obtain from a bank the funds necessary to\r\n  begin again, and from this responsibility he was, for a series of\r\n  years, seldom released. The single volume per annum being found\r\n  insufficient for the communications, two volumes a year were afterward\r\n  published, commencing with the second volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe publishers whose names appear on the title page of the four numbers\r\nof the first volume are “J. Eastburn & Co., Literary Rooms, Broadway,\r\nNew York” and “Howe & Spalding, New Haven.” For the second volume and\r\nthose immediately following the corresponding statement “printed and\r\npublished by S. Converse [New Haven] for the Editor.”\r\n\r\nSilliman adds (p. iv):\r\n\r\n\r\n  At the conclusion of vol. =10=, in February, 1826, the work was again\r\n  left upon the hands of its Editor; all its receipts had been absorbed\r\n  by the expenses, and it became necessary now to pay a heavy sum to the\r\n  retiring publisher, as an equivalent for his copies of previous\r\n  volumes, as it was deemed necessary either to control the work\r\n  entirely or to abandon it. The Editor was not willing to think of the\r\n  latter, especially as he was encouraged by public approbation, and was\r\n  cheered onward in his labors by eminent men both at home and abroad,\r\n  and he saw distinctly that the Journal was rendering service not only\r\n  to science and the arts, but to the reputation of his country. He\r\n  reflected, moreover, that in almost every valuable enterprise\r\n  perseverance in effort is necessary to success. He being now sole\r\n  proprietor, a new arrangement was made for a single year, the\r\n  publishers being at liberty, at the end of that time, to retire, and\r\n  the Editor to resume the Journal should he prefer that course.\r\n\r\n  The latter alternative he adopted, taking upon himself the entire\r\n  concern, including both the business and the editorial duties, and of\r\n  course, all the correspondence and accounts. From that time the work\r\n  has proceeded without interruption, two volumes per annum having been\r\n  published for the last twenty years; and its pecuniary claims ceased\r\n  to be onerous, although its means have never been large....\r\n\r\n\r\nLater in the same preface he adds (p. xiv):\r\n\r\n\r\n  It may be interesting to our readers to know something of the\r\n  patronage of the Journal. It has never reached one thousand paying\r\n  subscribers, and has rarely exceeded seven or eight hundred—for many\r\n  years it fluctuated between six and seven hundred.\r\n\r\n  It has been far from paying a reasonable editorial compensation; often\r\n  it has paid nothing, and at present it does little more than pay its\r\n  bills. The number of engravings and the extra labor in printer’s\r\n  composition, cause it to be an expensive work, while its patronage is\r\n  limited.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult at this date to give any adequate statement of the\r\namount of encouragement and active assistance given to Silliman by his\r\nscientific colleagues in New Haven and elsewhere—a subject earlier\r\nalluded to. It is fortunately possible, however, to acknowledge the\r\ngenerous aid received by the Journal in the early days from a source\r\nnear at hand. It has already been noted in another place that the\r\ndawning activity of science at New Haven was recognized by the founding\r\nof the “Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences,” formally established\r\nat New Haven in 1799 and the third scientific body to be organized in\r\nthis country. From the beginning of the Journal in 1818, the Connecticut\r\nAcademy freely gave its support both in papers for publication and at\r\nleast on one occasion later it gave important financial aid. Upon the\r\noccasion of the celebration of the centennial anniversary of the Academy\r\non October 11, 1899, Professor, later Governor, Baldwin, the president\r\nof the Academy, discusses this subject in some detail. He says in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  To support his [Silliman’s] undertaking, a vote had been passed in\r\n  February [1818], “that the Committee of Publication may allow such of\r\n  the Academy’s papers as they think proper, to be published in Mr.\r\n  Silliman’s Scientific Journal.”\r\n\r\n  Free use was made of this authority, and a large part of the contents\r\n  of the Journal was for many years drawn from this source. In some\r\n  cases this fact was noted in publication;[2] but in most it was\r\n  not....\r\n\r\n  In 1826, when the Journal was in great need of financial support, the\r\n  Academy further voted to pay for a year the cost of printing such of\r\n  its papers as might be published in it. In Baldwin’s Annals of Yale\r\n  College, published in 1831, it is described as a publication\r\n  “honorable to the science of our common country,” and having “an\r\n  additional value as being adopted as the acknowledged organ of the\r\n  Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMany active campaigns were carried on over the country through paid\r\nagents to obtain new subscribers for the Journal and it was doubtless\r\ndue to these efforts that the nominal subscription list was, at times,\r\nas already noted, relatively large as compared with that of a later\r\ndate. The new subscribers in many cases, however, did not remain\r\npermanently interested, often failed to pay their bills, and the\r\nuncertain and varying demand upon the supply of printed copies was\r\ndoubtless one reason why many single numbers became early out of print.\r\n\r\nAn interesting sidelight is thrown upon the efforts of Silliman to\r\ninterest the public in his work, at its beginning, by a letter to the\r\neditor from Thomas Jefferson, then seventy-five years of age. The writer\r\nis indebted to Mr. Robert B. Adam of Buffalo for a copy of this letter\r\nand its interest justifies its being reproduced here entire. The letter\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               Monticello, Apr. 11. ’18.\r\n\r\n  Sir\r\n\r\n  The unlucky displacement of your letter of Mar 3 has been the cause of\r\n  delay in my answer. altho’ I have very generally withdrawn from\r\n  subscribing to or reading periodical publications from the love of\r\n  rest which age produces, yet I willingly subscribe to the journal you\r\n  propose from a confidence that the talent with which it will be edited\r\n  will entitle it to attention among the things of select reading for\r\n  which alone I have time now left. be so good as to send it by mail,\r\n  and the receipt of the 1st number will be considered as announcing\r\n  that the work is commenced and the subscription money for a year shall\r\n  be forwarded. Accept the assurance of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n                                                           Th. Jefferson\r\n\r\n  Professor Silliman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Contributors._—An interesting summary is also given by Silliman of the\r\ncontributors to the Journal and the extent of their work (vol. =50=, pp.\r\nxii, xiii); he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n  We find that there have been about 600 contributors of original matter\r\n  to the Journal, and we have the unexpected satisfaction of believing\r\n  that probably five-sixths of them are still living; for we are not\r\n  certain that more than fifty are among the dead; of perhaps fifty more\r\n  we are without information, and if that additional number is to be\r\n  enrolled among the “stelligeri,” we have still 500 remaining. Among\r\n  them are not a few of the veterans with whom we began our career, and\r\n  several of these are still active contributors. Shall we then conclude\r\n  that the peaceful pursuits of knowledge are favorable to long life?\r\n  This we think is, _cœteris paribus_, certainly true: but in the\r\n  present instance, another reason can be assigned for the large amount\r\n  of survivorship. As the Journal has advanced and death has removed its\r\n  scientific contributors, younger men and men still younger, have\r\n  recruited the ranks, and volunteers have enlisted in numbers\r\n  constantly increasing, so that the flower of the host are now in the\r\n  morning and meridian of life.\r\n\r\n  We have been constantly advancing, like a traveller from the\r\n  equinoctial towards the colder zones,—as we have increased our\r\n  latitude, stars have set and new stars have risen, while a few\r\n  planetary orbs visible in every zone, have continued to cheer us on\r\n  our course.\r\n\r\n  The number of articles, almost exclusively original, contained in the\r\n  Journal is about 1800, and the Index will show how many have been\r\n  contributed by each individual; we have doubtless included in this\r\n  number _some few_ articles republished from foreign Journals—but we\r\n  think they are even more than counterbalanced by original\r\n  communications without a name and by editorial articles, both of which\r\n  have been generally omitted in the enumeration.\r\n\r\n  Of smaller articles and notices in the Miscellany, we have not made\r\n  any enumeration, but they evidently are more numerous than the regular\r\n  articles, and we presume that they may amount to at least 2500.\r\n\r\n  Of party, either in politics or religion, there is no trace in our\r\n  work; of personalities there are none, except those that relate to\r\n  priority of claims or other rights of individuals. Of these\r\n  vindications the number is not great, and we could heartily have\r\n  wished that there had been no occasion for any.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Scope of Articles._—Many references will be found in the\r\nchapters following which throw light upon the character and scope of the\r\npapers published in the Journal, particularly in its early years; a few\r\nadditional statements here may, however, prove of interest.\r\n\r\nOne feature that is especially noticeable is the frequent publication of\r\narticles planned to place before the readers of the Journal in full\r\ndetail subjects to which they might not otherwise have access. These are\r\nsometimes translations; sometimes republications of articles that had\r\nalready appeared in English periodicals; again, they are exhaustive and\r\ncritical reviews of important memoirs or books. The value of this\r\nfeature in the early history of the Journal, when the distribution of\r\nscientific literature had nothing of the thoroughness characteristic of\r\nrecent years, is sufficiently obvious.\r\n\r\nIt is also interesting to note the long articles of geological\r\ndescription and others giving lists of mineral or botanical localities.\r\nNoteworthy, too, is the attempt to keep abreast of occurring phenomena\r\nas in the many notes on tornadoes and storms by Redfield, Loomis, etc.;\r\non auroras at different localities; on shooting stars by Herrick,\r\nOlmstead and others.\r\n\r\nThe wide range of topics treated of is quite in accordance with the plan\r\nof the editor as given on an earlier page. Some notes, taken more or\r\nless at random, may serve to illustrate this point. An extended and\r\nquite technical discussion of “Musical Temperament” opens the first\r\nnumber (=1=, pp. 9–35) and is concluded in the same volume (pp.\r\n176–199). An article on “Mystery” is given by Mark Hopkins, A.M., “late\r\na tutor of Williams College” (=13=, 217, 1828). There is an essay on\r\n“Gypsies” by J. Griscom (from the Revue Encyclopédique) in volume =24=\r\n(pp. 342–345, 1833), while some notes on American gypsies are added in\r\nvol. =26= (p. 189, 1834). The “divining rod” is described at length in\r\nvol. =11= (pp. 201–212, 1826), but without giving any comfort to the\r\ncredulous; on the contrary the last paragraph states that “the\r\npretensions of diviners are worthless, etc.” A long article by J. Finch\r\non the forts of Boston harbour appeared in 1824 (=8=, 338–348); the\r\nconcluding paragraph seems worthy of quotation:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Many centuries hence, if despotism without, or anarchy within, should\r\n  cause the republican institutions of America to fade, then these\r\n  fortresses ought to be destroyed, because they would be a constant\r\n  reproach to the people; but until that period, they should be\r\n  preserved as the noblest monuments of liberty.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe promise to include the fine arts is kept by the publication of\r\nvarious papers, as of the Trumbull paintings (=16=, 163, 1829); also by\r\na series of articles on “architecture in the United States” (=17=, 99,\r\n1830; =18=, 218, 220, 1830) and others. Quite in another line is the\r\npaper by J. W. Gibbs (=33=, 324, 1838) on “Arabic words in English.” A\r\nnumber of related linguistic papers by the same author are to be found\r\nin other volumes. Papers in pure mathematics are also not infrequent,\r\nthough now not considered as falling within the field of the Journal.\r\n\r\nApplied science takes a prominent place through all the volume of the\r\nFirst Series. An interesting paper is that on Eli Whitney, containing an\r\naccount of the cotton gin; this is accompanied by an excellent portrait\r\n(=21=, 201–264, 1832). The steam engine and its application are\r\nrepeatedly discussed and in the early volumes brief accounts are given\r\nof the early steamboats in use; for example, between Stockholm and St.\r\nPetersburg (=2=, 347, 1820); Trieste and Venice (=4=, 377, 1822); on the\r\nSwiss Lakes (=6=, 385, 1823). The voyage of the first Atlantic\r\nsteamboat, the “Savannah,” which crossed from Savannah to Liverpool in\r\n1819, is described (=38=, 155, 1840); mention is also made of the “first\r\niron boat” (=3=, 371, 1821; =5=, 396, 1822). A number of interesting\r\nletters on “Steam Navigation” are given in vol. =35=, 160, 162, 332,\r\n333, 336; some of the suggestions seem very quaint, viewed in the light\r\nof the experience of to-day.\r\n\r\nA very early form of explosive engine is described at length by Samuel\r\nMorey (=11=, 104, 1826); this is an article that deserves mention in\r\nthese days of gasolene motors. Even more interesting is the description\r\nby Charles Griswold (=2=, 94, 1820) of the first _submarine_ invented by\r\nDavid Bushnell and used in the Revolutionary War in August, 1776. An\r\naccount is also given of a dirigible balloon that may be fairly regarded\r\nas the original ancestor of the Zeppelin (see =11=, 346, 1826). The\r\nwhole subject of aërial navigation is treated at length by H. Strait\r\n(=25=, pp. 25, 26, 1834) and the expression of his hopes for the future\r\ndeserve quotation:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Conveyance by air can be easily rendered as safe as by water or land,\r\n  and more cheap and speedy, while the universal and uniform diffusion\r\n  of the air over every portion of the earth, will render aërial\r\n  navigation preferable to any other. To carry it into effect, there\r\n  needs only an immediate appeal on a sufficiently large scale, to\r\n  experiment; reason has done her part, when experiment does hers,\r\n  nature will not refuse to sanction the whole. Aërial navigation will\r\n  present the works of nature in all their charms; to commerce and the\r\n  diffusion of knowledge, it will bring the most efficient aid, and it\r\n  can thus be rendered serviceable to the whole human family.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA subject of quite another character is the first discussion of the\r\nproperties of chloroform (chloric ether) and its use as an anæsthetic\r\n(Guthrie, =21=, 64, 405, 1832; =22=, 105, 1832; Levi Ives, =21=, 406).\r\nFurther interesting communications are given of the first analyses of\r\nthe gastric juice and the part played by it in the process of digestion.\r\nDr. William Beaumont of St. Louis took advantage of a patient who\r\nthrough a gun-shot wound was left with a permanent opening into his\r\nstomach through which the gastric juice could be drawn off. The results\r\nof Dr. Beaumont and of Professor Robley Dunglison, to whom samples were\r\nsubmitted, are given in full in the life of Beaumont by Jesse S. Myer\r\n(St. Louis, 1912). The interest of the matter, so far as the Journal is\r\nconcerned, is chiefly because Dr. Beaumont selected Professor Silliman\r\nas a chemist to whom samples for examination were also submitted. An\r\naccount of Silliman’s results is given in the Beaumont volume referred\r\nto (see also =26=, 193, 1834). Desiring the support of a chemist of\r\nwider experience in organic analysis, he also sent a sample through the\r\nSwedish consul to Berzelius in Stockholm. After some months the sample\r\nwas received and it is interesting to note in a perfectly fresh\r\ncondition; it is to be regretted, however, that the Swedish chemist\r\nfailed to add anything to the results already obtained in this country\r\n(=27=, 40b, 1835).\r\n\r\nThe above list, which might be greatly extended, seems to leave little\r\nground for the implied criticism replied to by Silliman as follows\r\n(=16=, p. v, 1829):\r\n\r\n\r\n  A celebrated scholar, while himself an editor, advised me, in a\r\n  letter, to introduce into this Journal as much “_readable_” matter as\r\n  possible: and there was, pretty early, an earnest but respectful\r\n  recommendation in a Philadelphia paper, that Literature, in imitation\r\n  of the London Quarterly Journal of Science, &c. should be in form,\r\n  inscribed among the titles of the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _The Second, Third and Fourth Series._\r\n\r\nThe SECOND SERIES of the Journal, as already stated, began with January,\r\n1846. Up to this time the publication had been a quarterly or two\r\nvolumes annually of two numbers each. From 1846 until the completion of\r\nan additional fifty volumes in 1871, the Journal was made a bimonthly,\r\neach of the two yearly volumes having three numbers each. Furthermore, a\r\ngeneral index was given for each period of five years, that is for every\r\nten volumes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Edward S. Dana]\r\n\r\nMuch more important than this change was the addition to the editorial\r\nstaff of James Dwight Dana, Silliman’s son-in-law. Dana returned from\r\nthe four-years cruise of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition in 1842; he\r\nsettled in New Haven, was married in 1844, and in 1850 was appointed\r\nSilliman professor of Geology in Yale College. He was at this time\r\nactively engaged in writing his three quarto reports for the Expedition\r\nand hence did not begin his active professional duties in Yale College\r\nuntil 1856. Part of his inaugural address was quoted on an earlier page.\r\n\r\nDana had already performed the severe labor of preparing the complete\r\nindex to the First Series, a volume of about 350 pages, finally issued\r\nin 1847. From the beginning of the Second Series he was closely\r\nassociated with his brother-in-law, the younger Silliman. Later the\r\neditorial labor devolved more and more upon him and the larger part of\r\nthis he carried until about 1890. His work, was, however, somewhat\r\ninterrupted during periods of ill health. This was conspicuously true\r\nduring a year’s absence in Europe in 1859–60, made necessary in the\r\nsearch for health; during these periods the editorial responsibility\r\nrested entirely upon the younger Silliman. Of Dana’s contributions to\r\nscience in general this is not the place to speak, nor is the present\r\nwriter the one to dwell in detail upon his work for the Journal. This\r\nsubject is to such an extent involved in the history of geology and\r\nzoology, the subjects of several succeeding chapters, that it is\r\nadequately presented in them.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be worth stating that in the bibliography accompanying\r\nthe obituary notice of Dana (=49=, 329–356, 1895) some 250 titles of\r\narticles in the Journal are enumerated; these aggregate approximately\r\n2800 pages. The number of critical notes, abstracts, book reviews, etc.,\r\ncould be also given, were it worth while, but what is much more\r\nsignificant in this connection, than their number or aggregate length,\r\nis the fact that these notices are in a large number of cases—like those\r\nof Gray in botany—minutely critical and original in matter. They thus\r\ngive the writer’s own opinion on a multitude of different subjects. It\r\nwas a great benefit to Dana, as it was to science also, that he had this\r\nprompt means at hand of putting before the public the results of his\r\nactive brain, which continued to work unceasingly even in times of\r\nhealth prostration.\r\n\r\nThis may be the most convenient place to add that as Dana became\r\ngradually less able to carry the burden of the details involved in\r\nediting the Journal in addition to his more important scientific labors,\r\nparticularly from 1890 on, this work devolved more and more upon his\r\nson, the present editor, whose name was added to the editorial staff in\r\n1875, with volume =9=, of the Third Series. The latter has served\r\ncontinuously until the present time, with the exception of absences, due\r\nto ill health, in 1893–94 and in 1903; during the first of these\r\nProfessor Henry S. Williams and during the second Professor H. E.\r\nGregory occupied the editorial chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe THIRD SERIES began in 1871, after the completion of the\r\none-hundredth volume from the beginning in 1818. At this date the\r\nJournal was made a monthly and as such it remains to-day. Fifty volumes\r\nagain completed this series, which closed in 1895.\r\n\r\nThe FOURTH SERIES began with January, 1896, and the present number for\r\nJuly, 1918, is the opening one of the forty-sixth volume or, in other\r\nwords,—the one hundred and ninety-sixth volume of the entire issue since\r\n1818. The Fourth Series, according to the precedent established, will\r\nend with 1920.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Associate Editors._—In 1851 the new policy was introduced of adding\r\n“Associate Editors” to the staff. The first of these was Dr. Wolcott\r\nGibbs of Cambridge. He began his duties with the eleventh volume of the\r\nSecond Series in 1851 and continued them with unceasing care and\r\nthoroughness for more than twenty years. In a note dated Jan. 1, 1851\r\n(=11=, 105), he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is my intention in future to prepare for the columns of this\r\n  Journal abstracts of the more important physical and chemical memoirs\r\n  contained in foreign scientific journals, accompanied by references,\r\n  and by such critical observations as the occasion may demand.\r\n  Contributions of a similar character from others will of course not be\r\n  excluded by this arrangement, but I shall hold myself responsible only\r\n  for those notices which appear over my initials.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe departments covered by Dr. Gibbs, in his excellent monthly\r\ncontributions, embraced chemistry and physics, and these subjects were\r\ncarried together until 1873 when they were separated and the physical\r\nnotes were furnished, first by Alfred M. Mayer and later successively by\r\nE. C. Pickering (from 1874), J. P. Cooke (from 1877), and John\r\nTrowbridge (from 1880). The first instalment of the long series of notes\r\nin chemistry and chemical physics by George F. Barker was printed in\r\nvolume =50=, 1870. He came in at first to occasionally relieve Dr.\r\nGibbs, but soon took the entire responsibility. His name was placed\r\namong the associate editors on the cover in 1877 and two years later Dr.\r\nGibbs formally retired. It may be added that from the beginning in 1851\r\nto the present time, the notes in “Chemistry and Physics” have been\r\ncontinued almost without interruption.\r\n\r\nThe other departments of science have been also fully represented in the\r\nnotes, abstracts of papers published, book notices, etc., of the\r\nsuccessive numbers, but as with the chemistry and physics the subject of\r\nbotany was long treated in a similar formal manner. For the notes in\r\nthis department, the Journal was for many years indebted to Dr. Asa\r\nGray, who became associate editor in 1853, two years after Gibbs,\r\nalthough he had been a not infrequent contributor for many years\r\npreviously. Gray’s contributions were furnished with great regularity\r\nand were always critical and original in matter. They formed indeed one\r\nof the most valuable features of the Journal for many years; as\r\nbotanists well appreciate, and, as Professor Goodale has emphasized in\r\nhis chapter on botany, Gray’s notes are of vital importance in the\r\nhistory of the development of his subject. With Gray’s retirement from\r\nactive duty, his colleague, George W. Goodale, took up the work in 1888\r\nand in 1895 William G. Farlow, also of Cambridge, was added as an\r\nassociate editor in cryptogamic botany. At this time, however, and\r\nindeed earlier, the sphere of the Journal had unavoidably contracted and\r\nbotany perforce ceased to occupy the prominent place it had long done in\r\nthe Journal pages.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to present an appreciation of the truly\r\nmagnificent work of Asa Gray. It may not be out of place, however, to\r\ncall attention to the notice of Gray written for the Journal by his\r\nlife-long friend, James D. Dana (=35=, 181, 1888). The opening paragraph\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Our friend and associate, Asa Gray, the eminent botanist of America,\r\n  the broad-minded student of nature, ended his life of unceasing and\r\n  fruitful work on the 30th of January last. For thirty-five years he\r\n  has been one of the editors of this Journal, and for more than fifty\r\n  years one of its contributors; and through all his communications\r\n  there is seen the profound and always delighted student, the\r\n  accomplished writer, the just and genial critic, and as Darwin has\r\n  well said, ‘The lovable man.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third associate editor, following Gray, was Louis Agassiz, whose\r\nwork for science, particularly in his adopted home in this country,\r\ncalls for no praise here. His term of service extended from 1853 to 1866\r\nand, particularly in the earlier years, his contributions were numerous\r\nand important. The next gentleman in the list was Waldo I. Burnett, of\r\nBoston, who served one year only, and then followed four of Dana’s\r\ncolleagues in New Haven, of whose generosity and able assistance it\r\nwould be impossible to say too much. These gentlemen were Brush in\r\nmineralogy; Johnson in chemistry, particularly on the agricultural side;\r\nNewton in mathematics and astronomy, whose contributions will be spoken\r\nof elsewhere; and Verrill—a student of Agassiz—in zoology.\r\n\r\nAll of these gentlemen, besides their frequent and important original\r\narticles, were ever ready not only to give needed advice, but also, to\r\nfurnish brief communications, abstracts of papers and book reviews, and\r\notherwise to aid in the work. Verrill particularly furnished the Journal\r\na long list of original and important papers, chiefly in systematic\r\nzoology, extending from 1865 almost down to the present year. His\r\nabstracts and book notices also were numerous and trenchant and it is\r\nnot too much to say that without him the Journal never could have filled\r\nthe place in zoology which it so long held. Much later the list of New\r\nHaven men was increased by the addition of Henry S. Williams (1894), and\r\nO. C. Marsh (1895).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wolcott Gibbs]\r\n\r\nOf the valuable work of those more or less closely associated in the\r\nconduct of the Journal at the present time, it would not be appropriate\r\nto speak in detail. It must suffice to say that the services rendered\r\nfreely by them have been invaluable, and to their aid is due a large\r\npart of the success of the Journal, especially since the Fourth Series\r\nbegan in 1896. But even this statement is inadequate, for the\r\neditor-in-chief has had the generous assistance of other gentlemen,\r\nwhose names have not been placed on the title page, and who have also\r\nplayed an important part in the conduct of the Journal. This policy,\r\nindeed, is not a matter of recent date. Very early in the First Series,\r\nProfessor Griscom of Paris, as already noted, furnished notes of\r\ninteresting scientific discoveries abroad. Other gentlemen have from\r\ntime to time acted in the same capacity. The most prominent of them was\r\nProfessor Jerome Nicklès of Nancy, France, who regularly furnished a\r\nseries of valuable notes on varied subjects, chiefly from foreign\r\nsources, extending from 1852 to 1869. On the latter date he met an\r\nuntimely death in his laboratory in connection with experiments upon\r\nhydrofluoric acid (=47=, 434, 1869).\r\n\r\nIt may be added, further, that one of the striking features about the\r\nJournal, especially in the earlier half century of its existence, is the\r\npersonal nature of many of its contributions, which were very frequently\r\nin the form of letters written to Benjamin Silliman or J. D. Dana. This\r\nis perhaps but another reflection of the extent to which the growth of\r\nthe magazine centered around these two men, whose wide acquaintance and\r\nbroad scientific repute made of the Journal a natural place to record\r\nthe new and interesting things that were being discovered in science.\r\n\r\nThe following list gives the names and dates of service, as recorded on\r\nthe Journal title pages, of the gentlemen formally made Associate\r\nEditors:\r\n\r\n            Wolcott Gibbs       (2) 11, 1851 to (3) 18, 1879\r\n            Asa Gray             „  15, 1853 „   „  34, 1887\r\n            Louis Agassiz        „  16, 1853 „  (2) 41, 1866\r\n            Waldo I.

Uhler      „  33, 1912\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Present and Future Conditions._\r\n\r\nThe field to be occupied by the “American Journal of Science and Arts,”\r\nas seen by its founder in 1818 and presented by him in the first number,\r\nas quoted entire on an earlier page, was as broad as the entire sphere\r\nof science itself. It thus included all the departments of both pure and\r\napplied science and extended even to music and fine arts also. As the\r\nyears went by, however, and the practical applications of science\r\ngreatly increased, technical journals started up, and the necessity of\r\ncultivating this constantly expanding field diminished. It was not,\r\nhowever, until January, 1880, that “the Arts” ceased to be a part of the\r\nname by which the Journal was known.\r\n\r\nAbout the same date also—or better a little earlier—began an increasing\r\ndevelopment of scientific research, particularly as fostered by the\r\ngraduate schools of our prominent universities. The full presentation of\r\nthis subject would require much space and is indeed unnecessary as the\r\nmain facts must be distinct in the mind of the reader. It is only right,\r\nhowever, that the large part played in this movement by the Johns\r\nHopkins University (founded in 1876) should be mentioned here.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this movement, which has been of great benefit in\r\nstimulating the growth of science in the country, many new journals of\r\nspecialized character have come into existence from time to time.\r\nFurther localization and specialization of scientific publication have\r\nresulted from the increased activity of scientific societies and\r\nacademies at numerous centers and the springing into existence thereby\r\nof new organs of publication through them, as also through certain of\r\nthe Government Departments, the Carnegie Institution, and certain\r\nuniversities and museums.\r\n\r\nAs bearing upon this subject, the following list of the more prominent\r\nscientific periodicals started in this country since 1867 is not without\r\ninterest:\r\n\r\n 1867–    .  American Naturalist.\r\n\r\n 1875–    .  Botanical Bulletin; later Botanical Gazette.\r\n\r\n 1879–1913.  American Chemical Journal.\r\n\r\n 1880–1915.  School of Mines Quarterly.\r\n\r\n 1883–    .  Science.\r\n\r\n 1885–    .  Journal of Heredity.\r\n\r\n 1887–    .  Journal of Morphology.\r\n\r\n 1887–1908.  Technology Quarterly.\r\n\r\n 1888–1905.  American Geologist.\r\n\r\n 1891–    .  Journal of Comparative Neurology.\r\n\r\n 1893–    .  Journal of Geology.\r\n\r\n 1893–    .  Physical Review.\r\n\r\n 1895–    .  Astrophysical Journal.\r\n\r\n 1896–    .  Journal of Physical Chemistry.\r\n\r\n 1896–    .  Terrestrial Magnetism.\r\n\r\n 1897–1899.  Zoological Bulletin; followed by\r\n\r\n 1900–    .  Biological Bulletin.\r\n\r\n 1901–    .  American Journal of Anatomy.\r\n\r\n 1904–    .  Journal of Experimental Zoology.\r\n\r\n 1905–    .  Economic Geology.\r\n\r\n 1906–    .  Anatomical Record.\r\n\r\n 1907–    .  Journal of Economic Entomology.\r\n\r\n 1911–    .  Journal of Animal Behavior.\r\n\r\n 1914–    .  American Journal of Botany.\r\n\r\n 1916–    .  Genetics.\r\n\r\n 1918–    .  American Journal of Physical Anthropology.\r\n\r\nThe result of the whole movement has been of necessity to narrow, little\r\nby little, the sphere of a general scientific periodical such as the\r\nJournal has been from the beginning. The exact change might be studied\r\nin detail by tabulating as to subjects the contents of successive\r\nvolumes, decade by decade, from 1870 down. It is sufficient, here,\r\nhowever, to recognize the general fact that while the number of original\r\npapers published in the periodicals of this country, in 1910, for\r\nexample, was very many times what it was in 1825, a large part of these\r\nhave naturally found their home in periodicals devoted to the special\r\nsubject dealt with in each case. That this movement will continue,\r\nthough in lessened degree now that the immediate demand is measurably\r\nsatisfied, is to be expected. At the same time it has not seemed wise,\r\nat any time in the past, to formally restrict the pages of the Journal\r\nto any single group of subjects. The future is before us and its\r\nproblems will be met as they arise. At the moment, however, there seems\r\nto be still a place for a scientific monthly sufficiently broad to\r\ninclude original papers of important general bearing even if special in\r\nimmediate subject. In this way it would seem that “Silliman’s Journal”\r\ncan best continue to meet the ideals of its honored founder, modified as\r\nthey must be to meet the change of conditions which a century of\r\nscientific investigation and growth have wrought. Incidentally it is not\r\nout of place to add that a self-supporting, non-subsidized scientific\r\nperiodical may hope to find a larger number of subscribers from among\r\nthe workers in science and the libraries if it is not too restricted in\r\nscope.\r\n\r\nThe last subject touched upon introduces the essential matter of\r\nfinancial support without which no monthly publication can survive. With\r\nrespect to the periodicals of recent birth, listed above, it is safe to\r\nsay that some form of substantial support or subsidy—often very\r\ngenerous—is the rule, perhaps the universal one. This has never been the\r\ncase with the American Journal. The liberality and broad-minded attitude\r\nof Yale College in the early days, and of the Yale University that has\r\ndeveloped from it, have never been questioned. At the same time the\r\nspecial conditions have been such as to make it desirable that the\r\nresponsibility of meeting the financial requirements should be carried\r\nby the editors-in-chief. At present the Yale Library gives adequate\r\npayment for certain publications received by the Journal in exchange,\r\nthough for many years they were given to it as a matter of course, free\r\nof charge. Beyond this there is nothing approaching a subsidy.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties on the financial side met with by the elder Silliman\r\nhave been suggested, although not adequately presented, in the various\r\nstatements quoted from early volumes. The same problems in varying\r\ndegree have continued for the past sixty years. Since 1914 they have\r\nbeen seriously aggravated for reasons that need not be enlarged upon.\r\nPrior to that date the subscription list had, for reasons chiefly\r\ninvolved in the development of special journals, been much smaller than\r\nthe number estimated by Silliman, for example, in volume =50= (p. xiv),\r\nalthough there has been this partial compensation that the considerable\r\nnumber of well-established libraries on the subscription list has meant\r\na greater degree of stability and a smaller proportion of bad accounts.\r\nThe past four years, however, the Journal, with all similar undertakings\r\nhere and elsewhere, has been compelled to bear its share of the burden\r\nof the world war in diminished receipts and greatly increased expenses.\r\nIt is gratifying to be able to acknowledge here the generosity of the\r\nauthors, or of the laboratories with which they have been connected, in\r\ntheir willingness not infrequently to give assistance, for example, in\r\nthe payment of more or less of the cost of engravings, or in a few\r\nspecial cases a large portion of the total cost of publication. In this\r\nway the problem of ways and means, constantly before the editor who\r\nbears the sole responsibility, has been simplified.\r\n\r\nIt should also be stated that as those immediately interested have\r\nlooked forward to the present anniversary, it has been with the hope\r\nthat this occasion might be an appropriate one for the establishment of\r\na “Silliman Fund” to commemorate the life and work of Benjamin Silliman.\r\nThe income of such a fund would lift from the University the burden that\r\nmust unavoidably fall upon it when the responsibility for the conduct of\r\nthe Journal can no longer be carried by members of the family including\r\nthe editor and—as in years long past—a silent partner whose aid on the\r\nbusiness side has been essential to the efficiency and economy of the\r\nenterprise. Present conditions are not favorable for such a movement,\r\nalthough something has been already accomplished in the desired\r\ndirection. At the present time every patriotic citizen must feel it his\r\nfirst duty to give his savings as well as his spare income to the\r\nsupport of the National Government in the world struggle for freedom in\r\nwhich it is taking part. But, whatever the exact condition of the future\r\nmay be, it cannot be questioned that the Journal founded by Benjamin\r\nSilliman in 1818 will survive and will continue to play a vital part in\r\nthe support and further development of science.\r\n\r\nThe present year of 1918 finds the world at large, and with it the world\r\nof science, painfully crushed beneath the overwhelming weight of a world\r\nwar of unprecedented severity. The four terrible years now nearly\r\nfinished have seen a fearful destruction of life and property which must\r\nhave a sad influence on the progress of science for many years to come.\r\nOnly in certain restricted lines has there been a partial compensation\r\nin the stimulating influence due to the immediate necessities connected\r\nwith the great conflict. One hundred years ago “the reign of war” was\r\nkeenly in the mind of the editor in beginning his work, but for him,\r\nhappily, the long period of the Napoleonic wars was already in the past,\r\nas also the brief conflict of 1812, in which this country was engaged\r\nand in which Silliman himself played a minor part. We, too, must\r\nbelieve, no matter how serious the outlook of the present moment, that a\r\nfundamental change will come in the not distant future; the nations of\r\nthe world must sooner or later turn once more to peaceful pursuits and\r\nthe scientific men of different races must become again not enemies but\r\nbrothers engaged in the common cause of uplifting human life. The peace\r\nthat we look forward to to-day is not for this country alone, but a\r\npeace which shall be a permanent blessing to the entire world for ages\r\nto come.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.—The portrait which forms the frontispiece of this volume has been\r\nreproduced from the plate in volume =50= (1847). The original painting\r\nwas made by H. Willard in 1835, when Silliman was in Boston engaged in\r\ndelivering the Lowell lectures; he was then nearly fifty-six years of\r\nage. The engraving, as he states elsewhere, was made from this painting\r\nfor the Yale Literary Magazine, and was published in the number for\r\nDecember, 1839.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to quote the remarks with which the editor introduces\r\nthe portrait (=50=, xviii, 1847). He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The portrait prefixed to this volume was engraved for a very different\r\n  purpose and for others than the patrons of this Journal. It has been\r\n  suggested by friends, whose judgment we are accustomed to respect,\r\n  that it ought to find a place here, since it is regarded as an\r\n  authentic, although, perhaps, a rather austere resemblance. In\r\n  yielding to this suggestion, it may be sufficient to quote the\r\n  sentiment of Cowper on a similar occasion, who remarked—“that after a\r\n  man has, for many years, turned his mind _inside out_ before the\r\n  world, it is only affectation to attempt to hide his face.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _Notes._\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  The statements given are necessarily much condensed, without an\r\n  attempt to follow all changes of title; furthermore, the dates of\r\n  actual publication for the academies given above are often somewhat\r\n  vaguely recorded. For fuller information see Scudder’s “Catalogue of\r\n  Scientific Serials, 1633–1876,” Cambridge, 1876; also H. Carrington\r\n  Bolton’s “Catalogue of Scientific and Technical Periodicals,\r\n  1665–1882” (Smithsonian Institution, 1885). The writer is much\r\n  indebted to Mr. C. J. Barr, Assistant Librarian of Yale University\r\n  Library, for his valuable assistance in this connection.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  The following footnote accompanies the opening article of the first\r\n  volume of the Journal. “From the MS. papers of the Connecticut\r\n  Academy, now published by permission.” Similar notes appear elsewhere.\r\n  Ed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n   A CENTURY OF GEOLOGY.—THE PROGRESS OF HISTORICAL GEOLOGY IN NORTH\r\n                                AMERICA\r\n\r\n                          By CHARLES SCHUCHERT\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Introduction._\r\n\r\nThe American Journal of Science, “one of the greatest influences in\r\nAmerican geology,” founded in 1818, has published a little more than\r\n92,000 pages of scientific matter. Of geology, including mineralogy,\r\nthere appear to be upward of 20,000 pages. What a vast treasure house of\r\ngeologic knowledge is stored in these 194 volumes, and how well the\r\neditors have lived up to their proposed “plan of work” as stated in the\r\nopening volume, where Silliman says: “It is designed as a deposit for\r\noriginal American communications” in “the physical sciences ... and\r\nespecially our mineralogy and geology” (=1=, v, 1818)! Not only is it\r\nthe oldest continuously published scientific journal of this country,\r\nbut it has proved itself to be “perhaps the most important geological\r\nperiodical in America” (Merrill). It is impossible to adequately present\r\nin this memorial volume of the Journal the contents of the articles on\r\nthe geological sciences.\r\n\r\nEditor Silliman was not only the founder of the Journal, but the\r\ngenerating center for the making of geologists and promoting geology\r\nduring the rise of this science in America. For nearly three decades,\r\nthe workers came to him for counsel and help, and he had a kind paternal\r\nword for them all. This influence is also shown in the many letters\r\nwhich were addressed to him, and which he published in the Journal. A\r\nsimilar influence, paternal care, and constructive criticism were\r\ncontinued by James D. Dana, and especially in his earlier career as\r\neditor.\r\n\r\nNot including mineralogy, there are in the Journal upward of 1500\r\ndistinct articles on geology. Of these, over 400 are on vertebrate\r\npaleontology, about 325 on invertebrate paleontology, and 90 on\r\npaleobotany. Of articles bearing on historical geology there are about\r\n160, and on stratigraphic geology more than 360. In addition to all\r\nthis, there are more than 2000 pages of geologic matter relating to\r\nbooks and of letters communicated to the editors Silliman and Dana. We\r\nmay summarize with Doctor Merrill’s statement in his well-known\r\nContributions to the History of American Geology:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “From its earliest inception geological notes and papers occupied a\r\n  prominent place in its pages, and a perusal of the numbers from the\r\n  date of issue down to the present time will, alone, afford a fair idea\r\n  of the gradual progress of American geology.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore presenting a synopsis of the more important steps in the progress\r\nof historical geology in America, it will be well to introduce a rapid\r\nsurvey of the rise of geology in Europe, for, after all, American\r\ngeology grew out of that of England, France and Germany. This dependence\r\nwas conspicuously true during the first four decades of the previous\r\ncentury. With the rise of the first New York State Survey (1836–1843)\r\nand that of Pennsylvania (1836–1844, 1858), American geology became more\r\nor less independent of Europe. Finally, this article will conclude with\r\na survey of the rise of paleometeorology, paleogeography, evolution, and\r\ninvertebrate paleontology.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _The Rise of Geology in Europe._\r\n\r\n_Mineral Geology._—The geological sciences had their rise in the study\r\nof minerals as carried on by the German chemist and physician George\r\nBauer (1494–1555), better known as Agricola. Bauer originated the\r\ncritical study of minerals, but did not distinguish his “fossilia,” the\r\nremains of organisms, from the inorganic crystal forms. Mineral geology\r\nendured until the close of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n_Cosmogonists._—Then came the expounders of the earth’s origin, the\r\ncosmogonists of the sixteenth to the end of the eighteenth centuries.\r\nThe fashion of this time was to write histories of the earth derived out\r\nof the imagination.\r\n\r\n_Earliest Historical Geology._—Even though Giovanni Arduino (1713–1795)\r\nof Padua was not the first to classify the rocks into three series\r\naccording to their age, he did this more clearly than any one else\r\nbefore his time. The rocks about Verona he grouped in 1759 into Primary,\r\nSecondary, Tertiary, and Volcanic. This three-fold classification came\r\ninto general use, though modified with time.\r\n\r\nEarly in the nineteenth century it had become plain that formations of\r\nvery varying ages were included in each one of the three series. Through\r\nthe study of the fossils and the recognition of the fact that mountain\r\nranges have been raised at various times, causing younger fossiliferous\r\nstrata to take on the characters of the Primary, it was seen that these\r\nterms of Arduino had lost their original significance.\r\n\r\nThe first one to describe in detail a local stratigraphic sequence was\r\nJohann Gottlob Lehmann (died 1767). In 1756 he published “one of the\r\nclassics of geological literature,” distinguishing clearly thirty\r\nsuccessive sedimentary deposits, some of which he said had fossils, but\r\nhe did not use them to distinguish the strata.\r\n\r\nWhat Lehmann did for the Permian system, George Christian Füchsel\r\n(1722–1773) did even better for the Triassic of Thuringia, in 1762 and\r\n1773. He pointed out not only the sequence, but also how the gently\r\ninclined strata rest upon the older upturned masses of the mountains;\r\nalso that some formations have only marine fossils, while others have\r\nonly terrestrial forms and thus indicate the proximity of land. The\r\ndeformed strata he thought had fallen into the hollows within the earth,\r\ngreat caverns that had also consumed much of the oceanic waters and had\r\nin so doing greatly lowered the sea-level. It was Füchsel who first\r\nintroduced the theory of universal formations, and who defined the term\r\nformation, using it as we now do, system or period. Even though Lehmann\r\nand Füchsel showed that there was a definite order and process in the\r\nformation of the earth’s crust, their example was barren of followers\r\nuntil the beginning of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n_Wernerian Geology or Geognosy._—We come now to the time of Abraham\r\nGottlob Werner (1749–1817), who from 1775 to 1817 was professor of\r\nmining and mineralogy in the Freiberg Academy of Mines. Geikie, in his\r\nmost interesting Founders of Geology, says that Werner “bulks far more\r\nlargely in the history of geology than any of those with whom up to the\r\npresent we have been concerned—a man who wielded an enormous authority\r\nover the mineralogy and geology of his day.” “Although he did great\r\nservice by the precision of his lithological characters and by his\r\ninsistence on the doctrine of geological succession, yet as regards\r\ngeological theory, whether directly by his own teaching, or indirectly\r\nby the labors of his pupils and followers, much of his influence was\r\ndisastrous to the higher interests of geology.”\r\n\r\nWerner arranged the crust of the earth into a series of formations, as\r\nhad been done previously by Lehmann and Füchsel, and one of his\r\nfundamental postulates was that all rocks were chemically precipitated\r\nin the ocean as “universal formations.” For this reason Werner’s school\r\nwere called the Neptunists. Nowhere, however, did he explain how and\r\nwhere the deep and primitive ocean had disappeared.\r\n\r\nAccording to Werner, the first formed or oldest rocks were the\r\nchemically deposited Primitive strata, including granite and other\r\nigneous and metamorphic rocks. On these followed the Transition rocks,\r\nthe earliest sediments of mechanical origin, and above them the Floetz\r\nrocks, a term for the horizontal stratified rocks. These last he said\r\nwere partly of chemical but chiefly of mechanical origin. Last of all\r\ncame the Alluvial series.\r\n\r\nThe existence of volcanoes had been pointed out long before Werner’s\r\ntime by the Italian school of geologists, but as for “the universality\r\nand potency of what is now termed igneous action,” all was “brushed\r\naside by the oracle of Freiberg.” Reactions between the interior and\r\nexterior of our earth “were utterly antagonistic to Werner’s conception\r\nof the structure and history of the earth.” To him, volcanoes were\r\n“burning mountains” that arose from the combustion of subterranean beds\r\nof coal, spontaneously ignited.\r\n\r\nThe breaking down of the Wernerian doctrines began with two of Werner’s\r\nmost distinguished pupils, D’Aubuisson de Voisins (1769–1819) and Von\r\nBuch. The former in 1803 had accepted Werner’s aqueous origin of basalt,\r\nbut after studying the celebrated and quite recent volcanic area of\r\nAuvergne he recanted in 1804. Here he saw the basaltic rocks lying upon\r\nand cutting through granite, and in places more than 1200 feet thick.\r\n“If these basaltic rocks were lavas,” says Geikie, “they must, according\r\nto the Wernerian doctrine, have resulted from the combustion of beds of\r\ncoal. But how could coal be supposed to exist under granite, which was\r\nthe first chemical precipitate of a primeval ocean?”\r\n\r\nLeopold von Buch (1774–1853), “the most illustrious geologist that\r\nGermany has produced,” after two years spent in Norway was satisfied\r\n“that the rocks in the Christiania district could not be arranged\r\naccording to the Wernerian plan, which there completely broke down. Von\r\nBuch found a mass of granite lying among fossiliferous limestones which\r\nwere manifestly metamorphosed, and were pierced by veins of granite,\r\nporphyry, and syenite.” Even so, he was not ready to abandon the\r\nteachings of his master. After a study of the mountain systems of\r\nGermany, however, “he declared that the more elevated mountains had\r\nnever been covered by the sea, as Werner had taught, but were produced\r\nby successive ruptures and uplifts of the terrestrial crust” (Geikie).\r\n\r\n_Rise of Geology and Conformism._—Modern geology has its rise in James\r\nHutton (1726–1797) of Edinburgh, Scotland. In 1785 and 1795, Hutton\r\npublished his Theory of the Earth, with Proofs and Illustrations. His\r\n“immortal theory” is his only work on geology. “Fortunately for Hutton’s\r\nfame and for the onward march of geology, the philosopher numbered among\r\nhis friends the illustrious mathematician and natural philosopher, John\r\nPlayfair (1748–1819), who had been closely associated with him in his\r\nlater years, and was intimately conversant with his geological\r\nopinions.” In 1802, Playfair published his Illustrations of the\r\nHuttonian Theory of the Earth, of which Geikie says, “Of this great\r\nclassic it is impossible to speak too highly,” as it is at the basis of\r\nall modern geology.\r\n\r\nOne of Hutton’s fundamental doctrines is that the earth is internally\r\nhot and that in the past large masses of molten material, the granites,\r\nhave been intruded into the crust. It was these igneous views that led\r\nto his followers being called the Plutonists. Another of his great\r\ndoctrines was that “the ruins of an earlier world lie beneath the\r\nsecondary strata,” and that they are separated by what is now known as\r\nunconformity. He clearly recognized a lost interval in the broken\r\nrelation of the structures, and that the ruins, the detrital materials,\r\nof one world after another are superposed in the structure of the earth.\r\n\r\nHutton also held that the deformation of once horizontally deposited\r\nstrata was probably brought about at different periods by great\r\nconvulsions that shook the very foundations of the earth. After a\r\nconvulsion, there was a long time of erosion, represented by the\r\nunconformity. Geikie says, “The whole of the modern doctrine of earth\r\nsculpture is to be found in the Huttonian theory.”\r\n\r\nThe Lyellian doctrine of metamorphism had its origin in Hutton, for he\r\nshowed that invading igneous granite had altered, through its heat and\r\nexpanding power, the originally waterlaid sediments, and that the\r\nschists of the Alps had been born of the sea like other stratified\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nHutton is the father of the Uniformitarian principle, for he “started\r\nwith the grand conception that the past history of our globe must be\r\nexplained by what can be seen to be happening now, or to have happened\r\nonly recently. The dominant idea in his philosophy is that the present\r\nis the key to the past.” This principle has been impressed on all later\r\ngeologists by Sir Charles Lyell, and is the chief cornerstone of modern\r\ngeology.\r\n\r\nThe principle of uniformitarianism has underlain geologic interpretation\r\nsince the days of Hutton, Playfair, and Lyell. However, it is often\r\napplied too rigidly in interpretations based upon the present\r\nconditions, because in the past there were long times when the\r\ntopographic features of the earth were very different from those of\r\nto-day. Throughout the Paleozoic, and, less markedly, the Mesozoic, the\r\noceans flooded the lands widely (at times over 60 per cent of the total\r\narea), highlands were inconspicuous, sediments far scarcer, and climates\r\nwarm and equable throughout the world. Highland conditions, and\r\nespecially the broadly emergent continents of the present, were only\r\nperiodically present in the Paleozoic and then for comparatively short\r\nintervals between the periods. Therefore rates of denudation, solution,\r\nsedimentation, and evolution have varied greatly throughout the\r\ngeological ages. These differences, however, relate to degrees of\r\noperation, and not to kinds of processes; but the differences in degree\r\nof operation react mightily on our views as to the age of the earth.\r\n\r\nGeologic time had, for Hutton, no “vestige of a beginning, no prospect\r\nof an end.” In other words, geologic time is infinite. He did not,\r\nhowever, discover a method by which the chronology of the earth could be\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n_First Important Text-books._—In 1822 appeared the ablest text-book so\r\nfar published, and the pattern for most of the later ones, Outlines of\r\nthe Geology of England and Wales, by W. D. Conybeare (1787–1857) and W.\r\nPhillips (1775–1828). “In this excellent volume all that was then known\r\nregarding the rocks of the country, from the youngest formations down to\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone, was summarized in so clear and methodical a\r\nmanner as to give a powerful impulse to the cultivation of geology in\r\nEngland” (Geikie). This book is reviewed at great length by Edward\r\nHitchcock in the Journal (=7=, 203, 1824).\r\n\r\nTo indicate how far historical geology had progressed up to 1822 in\r\nEngland, a digest of the geological column as presented in this\r\ntext-book is given in the following table, along with other information.\r\n\r\nA text-book writer of yet greater influence was Charles Lyell\r\n(1797–1875), whose Principles of Geology appeared in three volumes\r\nbetween 1830 and 1833. This and his other books were kept up to date\r\nthrough many editions, and his Elements of Geology is, as Geikie says,\r\n“the hand book of every English geologist” working with the\r\nfossiliferous formations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _The Rise of Geology in North America._\r\n\r\n_The Generating Centers._—In America, geology had its rise independently\r\nin three places: in the two scientific societies of Boston and\r\nPhiladelphia, and dominantly in Benjamin Silliman of Yale College.\r\nStated in another way, we may say that geology in America had its origin\r\nin the following pioneers and founders: first, in William Maclure at\r\nPhiladelphia, and next in Benjamin Silliman at New Haven. Through the\r\ninfluence of the latter, Amos Eaton, the botanist, became a geologist\r\nand taught geology at Williams College and later at the Rensselaer\r\nSchool in Troy, New York. Through the same influence Rev. Edward\r\nHitchcock also became a geologist and taught the subject after 1825 at\r\nAmherst College.\r\n\r\nSilliman was the first to take up actively the teaching of mineralogy\r\nand geology based on collections of specimens. He spread the knowledge\r\nin popular lectures throughout the Eastern States, graduated many a\r\nstudent in the sciences, making of some of them professional teachers\r\nand geologists, provided all with a journal wherein they could publish\r\ntheir research, organized the first geological society and through his\r\nstudents the first official geological surveys, and by kind words and\r\nacts stimulated, fostered, and held together American scientific men for\r\nfifty years. Of him it has been truly said that he was “the guardian of\r\nAmerican science from its childhood.”\r\n\r\n_The American Academy in Boston._—The second oldest scientific society,\r\nbut the first one to publish on geological subjects, was the American\r\nAcademy of Arts and Sciences of Boston, instituted and publishing since\r\n1780. Up to the time of the founding of this Journal, there had appeared\r\nin the publications of the American Academy about a dozen papers of a\r\ngeologic character, none of which need to be mentioned here excepting\r\none by S. L. and J. F. Dana, entitled “Outlines of the Mineralogy and\r\nGeology of Boston,” published in 1818. This is an early and important\r\nstep in the elucidation of one of the most intricate geologic areas, and\r\nis further noteworthy for its geologic map, the third one to appear, the\r\nolder ones being by Maclure and Hitchcock (Merrill).\r\n\r\n                     THE GEOLOGICAL COLUMN IN 1822\r\n\r\n ═══════════════════════════════════╤═════════════╤═════════════\r\n   Present American

Society of Philadelphia, started by the\r\nmany-sided Benjamin Franklin in 1769, and which has published since\r\n1771. Up to the time of the founding of the Journal in 1818, there had\r\nappeared in the publications of this society thirteen papers of a\r\ngeologic nature, nearly all small building stones in the rising geologic\r\nstory of North America. The only fundamental ones were Maclure’s\r\nObservations of 1809 and 1817. Later, in this same city, there was\r\norganized another scientific society that came to be for a long time the\r\nmost active one in America. This was the Academy of Natural Sciences,\r\nstarted in 1812 with seven members, but it was not until 1817 and the\r\nelection of William Maclure as its first president that the work of the\r\nAcademy was of a far-reaching character. Here was built up not only a\r\nsociety for the advancement of the natural sciences and publications for\r\nthe dissemination of such knowledge, but, what is equally important, the\r\nfirst large library and general museum.\r\n\r\nWilliam Maclure (1763–1840), correctly named by Silliman the “father of\r\nAmerican geology,” was born and educated in Scotland, and died near\r\nMexico City. A merchant of London until 1796, when he had already\r\namassed “a considerable fortune,” he made a first short visit to New\r\nYork City in 1782. In 1796 he again came to America, this time to become\r\na citizen of this country and a liberal patron of science.\r\n\r\nAbout 1803, single-handed and unsustained by government patronage,\r\nMaclure interested himself most zealously and efficiently in American\r\ngeology. In 1809 he published his Observations on the Geology of the\r\nUnited States, Explanatory of a Geological Map. This work he revised “on\r\na yet more extended scale,” issuing it in 1817 with 130 pages of text,\r\naccompanied by a large colored geological map.\r\n\r\n_Silliman, the Pioneer Promoter of Geology._—In 1806 when Benjamin\r\nSilliman (1779–1864) began actively to teach chemistry and mineralogy,\r\nall the sciences in America were in a very backward state, and the earth\r\nsciences were not recognized as such in the curricula of any of our\r\ncolleges. Silliman gave his first lecture in chemistry on April 4, 1804.\r\nIn the summer of that year, Yale College asked him to go to England to\r\npurchase material for the College, and great possibilities for\r\nbroadening his knowledge now loomed before him. As Silliman himself\r\n(=43=, 225, 1842) has told the interesting story of his sojourn in\r\nEngland and Scotland, it is worth while to restate a part of it here.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Passing over to England in the spring of 1805, and fixing my\r\n  residence for six months in London, I found there no school, public or\r\n  private, for geological instruction, and no association for the\r\n  cultivation of the science, which was not even named in the English\r\n  universities.” In geology “Edinburgh was then far in advance of\r\n  London.... Prof. Jameson having recently returned from the school of\r\n  Werner, fully instructed in the doctrines of his illustrious teacher,\r\n  was ardently engaged to maintain them, and his eloquent and acute\r\n  friend, the late Dr. John Murray, was a powerful auxiliary in the same\r\n  cause; both of these philosophers strenuously maintaining the\r\n  ascendancy of the aqueous over the igneous agencies, in the geological\r\n  phenomena of our planet.\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, the disciples and friends of Dr. Hutton were not\r\n  less active. He died in 1797, and his mantle fell upon Sir James Hall,\r\n  who, with Prof. Playfair and Prof. Thomas Hope, maintained with signal\r\n  ability, the igneous theory of Hutton. It did not become one who was\r\n  still a youth and a novice, to enter the arena of the geological\r\n  tournament where such powerful champions waged war; but it was very\r\n  interesting to view the combat, well sustained as it was on both\r\n  sides, and protracted, without a decisive issue, into a drawn\r\n  battle....\r\n\r\n  The conflicts of the rival schools of Edinburgh—the Neptunists and the\r\n  Vulcanists, the Wernerians and the Huttonians, were sustained with\r\n  great zeal, energy, talent, and science; they were indeed marked too\r\n  decidedly by a partisan spirit, but this very spirit excited untiring\r\n  activity in discovering, arranging, and criticising the facts of\r\n  geology. It was a transition period between the epoch of geological\r\n  hypotheses and dreams, which had passed by, and the era of strict\r\n  philosophical induction, in which the geologists of the present day\r\n  are trained....\r\n\r\n  I was a diligent and delighted listener to the discussions of both\r\n  schools. Still the igneous philosophers appeared to me to assume more\r\n  than had been proved regarding internal heat. In imagination we were\r\n  plunged into a fiery Phlegethon, and I was glad to find relief in the\r\n  cold bath of the Wernerian ocean, where my predilections inclined me\r\n  to linger.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Silliman’s Students and Their Publications._—Silliman’s first student\r\nto take up geology as a profession was Denison Olmstead (1791–1859),\r\neducator, chemist, and geologist, who was graduated from Yale in 1813.\r\nFour years later he was under special preparation with Silliman in\r\nmineralogy and geology, and in that year was appointed professor of\r\nchemistry in the University of North Carolina. In 1824–1825 Olmstead\r\nissued a Report on the Geology of North Carolina, which is the first\r\nofficial geological report issued by any state in America, “a\r\nconspicuous and solitary instance,” according to Hitchcock’s review of\r\nit (=14=, 230, 1828), “in which any of our state governments have\r\nundertaken thoroughly to develop their mineral resources.”\r\n\r\nAmos Eaton (1776–1842), lawyer, botanist, surveyor, and one of the\r\nfounders of American geology, was a graduate of Williams College in the\r\nclass of 1799. He studied with Silliman in 1815, attending his lectures\r\non chemistry, geology, and mineralogy. He also enjoyed access to the\r\nlibraries of Silliman and of the botanist, Levi Ives, in which works on\r\nbotany and materia medica were prominent, and was a diligent student of\r\nthe College cabinet of minerals. He settled as a lawyer and land agent\r\nin Catskill, New York, and here in 1810 he gave a popular course of\r\nlectures on botany, believed to have been the first attempted in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIn 1818 appeared Eaton’s first noteworthy geological publication, the\r\nIndex to the Geology of the Northern States, a text-book for the classes\r\nin geology at Williamstown. The controlling principle of this book was\r\nWernerism, a false doctrine from which Eaton was never able to free\r\nhimself. This book was “written over anew” and published in 1820.\r\n\r\nWhile at Albany in 1818, Governor De Witt Clinton asked Eaton to deliver\r\na course of lectures on chemistry and geology before the members of the\r\nlegislature of New York. It is believed that Eaton is the only American\r\nhaving this distinction, and because of it he became acquainted with\r\nmany leading men of the state, interesting them in geology and its\r\napplication to agriculture by means of surveys. In this way was sown the\r\nidea which eventually was to fructify in that great official work: The\r\nNatural History of New York. (See =43=, 215, 1842; and Youmans’ sketch\r\nof Eaton’s life, Pop. Sci. Monthly, Nov. 1890.)\r\n\r\nEdward Hitchcock (1793–1864), reverend, state geologist, college\r\npresident, and another of the founders of American geology, was largely\r\nself-taught. Previous to 1825, when he entered the theological\r\ndepartment of Yale College, he had met Amos Eaton, who interested him in\r\nbotany and mineralogy, and between 1815 and 1819 he had made lists of\r\nthe plants and minerals found about his native town, Deerfield,\r\nMassachusetts. Therefore, while studying theology at Yale it was natural\r\nfor him also to take up mineralogy and geology with Silliman, whose\r\nacquaintance he had made at least as early as 1818.\r\n\r\nHitchcock, who was destined to be one of the most prominent figures of\r\nhis time, was appointed in 1825 to the chair of chemistry and natural\r\nhistory at Amherst College. His first geologic paper, one of five pages,\r\nappeared in 1815. Three years later appeared his more important paper on\r\nthe Geology and Mineralogy of a Section of Massachusetts, New Hampshire,\r\nand Vermont (=1=, 105, 436, 1818). This is also noteworthy for its\r\ngeological map, the next one to be published after those of Maclure of\r\n1809 and 1817. In 1823 came a still greater work, A Sketch of the\r\nGeology, Mineralogy, and Scenery of the Regions contiguous to the River\r\nConnecticut (=6=, 1, 200, 1823; =7=, 1, 1824). Here the map above\r\nreferred to was greatly improved, and the survey was one of the most\r\nimportant of the older publications.\r\n\r\nYoumans in his account of Hitchcock (Pop. Sci. Monthly, Sept. 1895)\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The State of Massachusetts commissioned him to make a geological\r\n  survey of her territory in 1830. Three years were spent in the\r\n  explorations, and the work was of such a high character that other\r\n  States were induced to follow the example of Massachusetts.... The\r\n  State of New York sought his advice in the organization of a survey,\r\n  and followed his suggestions, particularly in the division of the\r\n  territory into four parts, and appointed him as the geologist of the\r\n  first district. He entered upon the work, but after a few days of\r\n  labor he found that he must necessarily be separated from his family,\r\n  much to his disinclination. He also conceived the idea of urging a\r\n  more thorough survey of his own State; hence he resigned his\r\n  commission and returned home. The effort for a resurvey of\r\n  Massachusetts was successful, and he was recommissioned to do the\r\n  work. The results appeared in 1841 and 1844.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOliver P. Hubbard was assistant to Silliman in 1831–1836, and then up to\r\n1866 taught chemistry, mineralogy, and geology at Dartmouth College.\r\nJames G. Percival was graduated at Yale in 1815, and in 1835 he and C.\r\nU. Shepard of Amherst College were appointed state geologists of\r\nConnecticut. Their report was issued in 1842.\r\n\r\nJames Dwight Dana (1813–1895) was undoubtedly the ablest of all of\r\nSilliman’s students. Graduated at Yale in 1833, he spent fifteen months\r\nin the United States Navy as instructor in mathematics, cruising off\r\nFrance, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. In 1836 he was assistant to Silliman,\r\nand in 1837, at the age of twenty-four years, he published his widely\r\nused System of Mineralogy. Two years later Dana joined the Wilkes\r\nExploring Expedition as mineralogist, returning to America in 1842; his\r\ngeological results of this expedition were published in 1849. In 1863,\r\nduring the Rebellion, he published his Manual of Geology, and through\r\nfour editions it remained for forty years the standard text-book for\r\nAmerican geologists.\r\n\r\n_First American Geological Society._—The founding in 1807 of the\r\nGeological Society of London, the parent of geological societies,\r\nundoubtedly had its stimulating effect on Silliman, and with his marked\r\norganizing ability he began to think of forming an American society of\r\nthe same kind. This he brought about the year following the appearance\r\nof the Journal, that is, in 1819. The American Geological Society, begun\r\nin 1819 (=1=, 442, 1819), was terminated in 1830 (=17=, 202, 1830). The\r\nfirst meeting (September 6, 1819) and all the subsequent ones were held\r\nin the cabinet of Yale College. The brief records of the doings of this\r\nsociety are printed in volumes =1=, =10=, =15=, and =18= of the Journal.\r\nSilliman was the attraction at the meetings, surrounded by his mineral\r\ncabinet, and he gave “the true scientific dress to all the naked\r\nmineralogical subjects” discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Wernerian Geology in North America._\r\n\r\n_The Father of American Geology._—Historical Geology begins in America\r\nwith William Maclure’s Observations on the Geology of the United States,\r\nissued in 1809. This was the first important original work on North\r\nAmerican geology, and its colored geological map was the first one of\r\nthe area east of the Mississippi River. The classification was\r\nessentially the Wernerian system. All of the strata of the Coastal\r\nPlain, now known to range from the Lower Cretaceous to Recent, were\r\nreferred to the Alluvial. To the west, over the area of the Piedmont,\r\nwere his Primitive rocks, while the older Paleozoic formations of the\r\nAppalachian ranges were referred to the Transition. West of the folded\r\narea, all was Floetz or Secondary, or what we now know as Paleozoic\r\nsedimentaries. The Triassic of the Piedmont area and that of Connecticut\r\nhe called the Old Red Sandstone, and the coal formations of the interior\r\nregion he said rested upon the Secondary. The second edition of the work\r\nin 1817 was much improved, along with the map, which was also printed on\r\na more correct geographic base. (For greater detail, see Merrill,\r\nContributions to the History of American Geology, 1906.)\r\n\r\nEven though Maclure’s geologic maps are much generalized, and the scheme\r\nof classification adopted a very broad one, they are in the main\r\ncorrect, even if they do emphasize unduly the rather simple geologic\r\nstructure of North America. This fact is patent all through Maclure’s\r\ndescription. Cleaveland also refers to it in his treatise of 1816, and\r\nSilliman in the opening volume of the Journal (=1=, 7, 1818) says: “The\r\noutlines of American geology appear to be particularly grand, simple,\r\nand instructive.” Then, all the kinds of rocks were comprehended under\r\nfour classes, Primitive, Transition, Alluvial, and Volcanic. It is also\r\ninteresting to note here that in 1822 Maclure had lost faith in the\r\naqueous origin of the igneous rocks and writes of the Wernerian system\r\nas “fast going out of fashion” (=5=, 197, 1822), while Hitchcock said\r\nabout the same thing in 1825 (=9=, 146).\r\n\r\n_The Work of Eaton._—Amos Eaton, after traveling 10,000 miles and\r\ncompleting his Erie Canal Report in 1824, “reviewed the whole line\r\nseveral times,” and published in 1828 in the Journal (=14=, 145) a paper\r\non Geological Nomenclature, Classes of Rocks, etc. The broader\r\nclassification is the Wernerian one of Primitive, Transition, and\r\nSecondary classes. Under the first two he has fossiliferous early\r\nPaleozoic formations, but does not know it, because he pays no attention\r\nanywhere to the detail of the entombed fossils, and all of his Secondary\r\nis what we now call Paleozoic. The correlations of the latter are faulty\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\nThen came his paper of 1830, Geological Prodromus (=17=, 63), in which\r\nhe says: “I intend to demonstrate ... that all geological strata are\r\narranged in five analogous series; and that each series consists of\r\nthree formations; viz., the Carboniferous [meaning mud-stones],\r\nQuartzose, and Calcareous.” We seem to see here expressed for the first\r\ntime the idea of “cycles of sedimentation,” but Eaton does not emphasize\r\nthis idea, and the localities given for each “formation” of “analogous\r\nseries” demonstrate beyond a doubt that he did not have a sedimentary\r\nsequence. The whole is simply a jumble of unrelated formations that\r\nhappen to agree more or less in their physical characters.\r\n\r\n“I intend to demonstrate,” he says further, “that the detritus of New\r\nJersey, embracing the marle, which contains those remarkable fossil\r\nrelics, is antediluvial, or the genuine Tertiary formation.” This\r\ncorrelation had been clearly shown by Finch in 1824 (=7=, 31) and yet\r\nboth are in error in that they do not distinguish the included\r\nCretaceous marls and greensands as something apart from the Tertiary.\r\n\r\nOne gets impatient with the later writings of Eaton, because he does not\r\nbecome liberalized with the progressive ideas in stratigraphic geology\r\ndeveloping first in Europe and then in America, especially among the\r\ngeologists of Philadelphia. Therefore it is not profitable to follow his\r\nwork further.\r\n\r\n_Early American Text-books of Geology._—The first American text-book of\r\ngeology bears the date of Boston 1816 and is entitled An Elementary\r\nTreatise on Mineralogy and Geology, its author being Parker Cleaveland\r\nof Bowdoin College. The second edition appeared in 1822. It also had a\r\ngeologic map of the United States, practically a copy of Maclure’s. To\r\nmineralogy were devoted 585 pages, and to geology 55, of which 37\r\ndescribe rocks and 5 the geology of the United States. The chronology is\r\nWernerian. Of “geological systems” there are two, “primitive and\r\nsecondary rocks.”\r\n\r\nIn 1818 appeared Amos Eaton’s Index to the Geology of the Northern\r\nStates, having 54 pages, and in 1820 came the second edition, “wholly\r\nwritten over anew,” with 286 pages. The theory of the later edition is\r\nstill that of Werner, with “improvements of Cuvier and Bakewell,” and\r\nyet one sees now-a-days but little in it of the far better English\r\ntext-book. Eaton did very little to advance philosophic geology in\r\nAmerica. What is of most value here are his personal observations in\r\nregard to the local geology of western Massachusetts, Connecticut,\r\nsouthwestern Vermont, and eastern New York (=1=, 69, 1819; also Merrill,\r\np. 234).\r\n\r\nWe come now to the most comprehensive and advanced of the early\r\ntext-books used in America. This is the third English edition of Robert\r\nBakewell’s Introduction to Geology (400 pages, 1829), and the first\r\nAmerican edition “with an Appendix Containing an Outline of his Course\r\nof Lectures on Geology at Yale College, by Benjamin Silliman” (128\r\npages). Bakewell’s good book is in keeping with the time, and while not\r\nso advanced as Conybeare and Phillips’s Outlines of 1822, yet is far\r\nmore so than Silliman’s appendix. The latter is general and not specific\r\nas to details; it is still decidedly Wernerian, though in a modified\r\nform. Silliman says he is “neither Wernerian nor Huttonian,” and yet his\r\nsummary on pages 120 to 126 shows clearly that he was not only a\r\nWernerian but a pietist as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n      _Unearthing of the Cenozoic and Mesozoic in North America._\r\n\r\n_The Discerning of the Tertiary._—The New England States, with their\r\nessentially igneous and metamorphic formations, could not furnish the\r\nproper geologic environment for the development of stratigraphers and\r\npaleontologists. So in America we see the rise of such geologists first\r\nin Philadelphia, where they had easy access to the horizontal and highly\r\nfossiliferous strata of the coastal plain. The first one to attract\r\nattention was Thomas Say, after him came John Finch, followed by Lardner\r\nVanuxem, Isaac Lea, Samuel G. Morton, and T. A. Conrad. These men not\r\nonly worked out the succession of the Cenozoic and the upper part of the\r\nMesozoic, but blazed the way among the Paleozoic strata as well.\r\n\r\nThomas Say (1787–1834), in 1819, was the first American to point out the\r\nchronogenetic value of fossils in his article, Observations on some\r\nSpecies of Zoophytes, Shells, etc., principally Fossil (=1=, 381). He\r\ncorrectly states that the progress of geology “must be in part founded\r\non a knowledge of the different genera and species of reliquiæ, which\r\nthe various accessible strata of the earth present.” Say fully realizes\r\nthe difficulties in the study of fossils, because of their fragmental\r\ncharacter and changed nature, and that their correct interpretation\r\nrequires a knowledge of similar living organisms.\r\n\r\nThe application of what Say pointed out came first in John Finch’s\r\nGeological Essay on the Tertiary Formations in America (=7=, 31, 1824).\r\nEven though the paper is still laboring under the mineral system and\r\ndoes not discern the presence of Cretaceous strata among his Tertiary\r\nformations, yet Finch also sees that “fossils constitute the medals of\r\nthe ancient world, by which to ascertain the various periods.”\r\n\r\nFinch now objects to the wide misuse in America of the term alluvial and\r\nholds that it is applied to what is elsewhere known as Tertiary. He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Geology will achieve a triumph in America, when the term alluvial\r\n  shall be banished from her Geological Essays, or confined to its\r\n  legitimate domain, and then her tertiary formations will be seen to\r\n  coincide with those of Europe, and the formations of London, Paris,\r\n  and the Isle of Wight, will find kindred associations in Virginia, the\r\n  Carolinas, Georgias, the Floridas, and Louisiana.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe formations as he has them from the bottom upwards are: (1)\r\nFerruginous sand, (2) Plastic clay, (3) Calcaire Silicieuse of the Paris\r\nBasin, (4) London Clay, (5) Calcaire Ostrée, (6) Upper marine formation,\r\n(7) Diluvial.\r\n\r\nThe grandest of these early stratigraphic papers, however, is that by\r\nLardner Vanuxem (1792–1848), of only three pages, entitled “Remarks on\r\nthe Characters and Classification of Certain American Rock Formations”\r\n(=16=, 254, 1829). Vanuxem, a cautious man and a profound thinker, had\r\nbeen educated at the Paris School of Mines. James Hall told the writer\r\nin a conversation that while the first New York State Survey was in\r\noperation, all of its members looked to Vanuxem for advice.\r\n\r\nIn the paper above referred to, Vanuxem points out in a very concise\r\nmanner that:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The alluvial of Mr. Maclure ... contains not only well characterized\r\n  alluvion, but products of the tertiary and secondary classes. Littoral\r\n  shells, similar to those of the English and Paris basins, and pelagic\r\n  shells, similar to those of the chalk deposition or latest secondary,\r\n  abound in it. These two kinds of shells are not mixed with each other;\r\n  they occur in different earthy matter, and, in the southern states\r\n  particularly, are at different levels. The incoherency or earthiness\r\n  of the mass, and our former ignorance of the true position of the\r\n  shells, have been the sources of our erroneous views.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second error of the older geologists, according to Vanuxem, was the\r\nextension of the secondary rocks over “the western country, and the back\r\nand upper parts of New York.” They are now called Paleozoic. Some had\r\neven tried to show the presence of Jurassic here because of the\r\nexistence of oölite strata. “It was taken for granted, that all\r\nhorizontal rocks are secondary, and as the rocks of these parts of the\r\nUnited States are horizontal in their position, so they were supposed to\r\nbe secondary.” He then shows on the basis of similar Ordovician fossils\r\nthat the rocks of Trenton Falls, New York, recur at Frankfort in\r\nKentucky, and at Nashville in Tennessee.\r\n\r\n“It is also certain that an uplifting or downfalling force, or both,\r\nhave existed, but it is not certain that either or both these forces\r\nhave acted in a uniform manner.... Innumerable are the facts, which have\r\nfallen under my observation, which show the fallacy of adopting\r\ninclination for the character of a class,” such as the Transition class\r\nof strata. He then goes on to say that in the interior of our country\r\nthe so-called secondary rocks are horizontal and in the mountains to the\r\neast the same strata are highly inclined. “The analogy, or identity of\r\nrocks, I determine by their fossils in the first instance, and their\r\nposition and mineralogical characters in the second or last instance.”\r\n\r\nIt appears that Isaac Lea (1792–1886) in his Contributions to Geology,\r\n1833, was the first to transplant to America Lyell’s terms, Pliocene,\r\nMiocene, and Eocene, proposed the previous year. The celebrated\r\nClaiborne locality was made known to Lea in 1829, and in the work here\r\ncited he describes from it 250 species, of which 200 are new. The\r\nhorizon is correlated with the London Clay and with the Calcaire\r\nGrossier of France, both of Eocene time (=25=, 413, 1834).\r\n\r\nTimothy A. Conrad began to write about the American Tertiary in 1830,\r\nand his more important publications were issued at Philadelphia. His\r\npapers in the Journal begin with 1833 and the last one on the Tertiary\r\nis in 1846.\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary faunas and stratigraphy have been modernized by William H.\r\nDall in his monumental work of 1650 pages and 60 plates entitled\r\n“Contributions to the Tertiary Fauna of Florida” (1885–1903). Here more\r\nthan 3160 forms of the Atlantic and Gulf deposits are described, but in\r\norder to understand their relations to the fossil faunas elsewhere and\r\nto the living world, the author studied over 10,000 species. Since then,\r\nmany other workers have interested themselves in the Tertiary problems.\r\nMuch good work is also being done in the Pacific States where the\r\nsequence is being rapidly developed.\r\n\r\n_The Discerning of the Eastern Cretaceous._—The Cretaceous sequence was\r\nfirst determined by that “active and acute geologist,” Samuel G. Morton\r\n(1799–1851), but that these rocks might be present along the Atlantic\r\nborder had been surmised as early as 1824 by Edward Hitchcock (=7=,\r\n216). Vanuxem, as above pointed out, indicated the presence of the\r\nCretaceous in 1829. In this same year Morton proved its presence before\r\nthe Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences.\r\n\r\nBetween 1830 and 1835 Morton published a series of papers in the Journal\r\nunder the title “Synopsis of the Organic Remains of the Ferruginous Sand\r\nFormation of the United States, with Geological Remarks” (=17=, 274, _et\r\nseq._). In these he describes the Cretaceous fossils and demonstrates\r\nthat the “Diluvial” and Tertiary strata of the Atlantic border also have\r\na long sequence of Cretaceous formations. In the opening paper he\r\nwrites: “I consider the marl of New Jersey as referable to the great\r\nferruginous sand series, which in Prof. Buckland’s arrangement is\r\ndesignated by the name of green sand.... On the continent this series is\r\ncalled the ancient chalk ... lower chalk,” etc. Again, the marls of New\r\nJersey are “geologically equivalent to those beds which in Europe are\r\ninterposed between the white chalk and the Oölites.” This correlation is\r\nwith the European Lower Cretaceous, but we now know the marls to be of\r\nUpper Cretaceous age. Although Eaton objected strenuously to Morton’s\r\ncorrelation, we find M. Dufresnoy of France saying, “Your limestone\r\nabove green sand reminds me very much of the Mæstricht beds,” a\r\ncorrelation which stands to this day (=22=, 94, 1832). In 1833 Morton\r\nannounces that the Cretaceous is known all along the Atlantic and Gulf\r\nborder, and in the Mississippi valley. “The same species of fossils are\r\nfound throughout,” and none of them are known in the Tertiary. He now\r\narranges the strata of the former “Alluvial” as follows:\r\n\r\n Modern   │Alluvial.\r\n     „    │Diluvial.\r\n ─────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n Tertiary │Upper Tertiary (Upper Marine).\r\n     „    │Middle Tertiary (London Clay).\r\n     „    │Lower Tertiary (Plastic Clay).\r\n ─────────┼─────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────\r\n Secondary│Calcareous Strata│Cretaceous group, or Ferruginous Sand\r\n          │                 │  series (=24=, 128).\r\n     „    │Ferruginous Sand │                     „\r\n\r\n_Western Cretaceous._—In 1841 and 1843 J. N. Nicollet announced the\r\ndiscovery of Cretaceous in the Rocky Mountain area. Of 20 species of\r\nfossils collected by him, 4 were said to occur on the Atlantic border,\r\nand of the 200 forms of the Atlantic slope only 1 was found in Europe.\r\nHere we see pointed out a specific dissimilarity between the continents,\r\nand a similarity between the American areas of Cretaceous deposits\r\n(=41=, 181; =45=, 153).\r\n\r\nThe Cretaceous of the Rocky Mountains was clearly developed by F. V.\r\nHayden in 1855–1888 and by F. B. Meek (1857–1876). Other workers in this\r\nfield were Charles A. White (1869–1891), and R. P. Whitfield\r\n(1877–1889). Since 1891 T. W. Stanton has been actively interpreting its\r\nstratigraphy and faunas.\r\n\r\n_Cretaceous and Comanche of Texas._—The broader outlines of the\r\nCretaceous of Texas had been described by Ferdinand Roemer in 1852 in\r\nhis good work, Kreidebildungen von Texas, but it was not until 1887 that\r\nRobert T. Hill showed in the Journal (=33=, 291) that it included two\r\ngreat series, the Gulf series, or what we now call Upper Cretaceous, and\r\na new one, the Comanche series. This was a very important step in the\r\nright direction. Since then the Comanche series has been regarded by\r\nsome stratigraphers as of period value, while others call it Lower\r\nCretaceous; the rest of the Texas Cretaceous is divided by Hill into\r\nMiddle and Upper Cretaceous. On the other hand, Lower Cretaceous strata\r\nhad been proved even earlier in the state of California, for here in\r\n1869 W. M. Gabb (1839–1878) and J. D. Whitney (1819–1896) had defined\r\ntheir Shasta group, which was wholly distinct faunally from the Comanche\r\nof Texas and the southern part of the Great Plains country.\r\n\r\n_Jurassic and Triassic of the West._—In 1864, the Geological Survey of\r\nCalifornia proved the presence of marine Upper Triassic in that State,\r\nand since then it has been shown that not only is all of the Triassic\r\npresent in Idaho (where it has been known since 1877), Oregon, Nevada,\r\nand California, but that the Upper Triassic is of very wide distribution\r\nthroughout western North America. Jurassic strata, on the other hand,\r\nwere not shown to be present in California until 1885, while in the\r\nRocky Mountain area of the United States there was long known an\r\nunresolved series of “Red Beds” situated between the Carboniferous and\r\nCretaceous. This gave rise to the “Red Bed problem,” the history of\r\nwhich is given by C. A. White in the Journal (=17=, 214, 1879). In 1869,\r\nF. V. Hayden announced the discovery of marine Jurassic fossils in this\r\nseries, and since then they have come to be known as the Sundance fauna,\r\nextending from southern Utah and Colorado into Alaska. Above lie the\r\ndinosaur-bearing fresh-water deposits, since 1894 known as the Morrison\r\nbeds. In 1896, O. C. Marsh (1831–1899) announced the presence of\r\nJurassic fresh-water strata along the Atlantic coast (=2=, 433), but\r\nto-day only a small part of them are regarded as of the age of the\r\nMorrison, while the far greater part are referred to the Comanche or\r\nLower Cretaceous. The red beds below the Jurassic of the Rocky Mountain\r\narea have during the past twenty years been shown to be in part of Upper\r\nTriassic age and of fresh-water origin, while the greater lower part is\r\nconnected with the Carboniferous series and is made up of brackish— and\r\nfresh-water deposits of probable Permian time.\r\n\r\n_Triassic of Atlantic States._—The fresh-water Triassic of the Atlantic\r\nborder states was first mentioned by Maclure (1817), who regarded it as\r\nthe equivalent of the Old Red Sandstone of Europe. In this he was\r\nfollowed by Hitchcock in 1823 (=6=, 39), the latter saying that above it\r\nlies “the coal formation,” which is true for Europe, but in America the\r\ncoal strata are older than these red beds, now known to be of Triassic\r\nage.\r\n\r\nThe first one to question this correlation was Alexandre Brongniart, who\r\nhad received from Hitchcock rock specimens and a fossil fish which he\r\nerroneously identified with a Permian species, and accordingly referred\r\nthe strata to the Permian (=3=, 220, 1821; =6=, 76, pl. 9, figs. 1, 2,\r\n1823). The discerning Professor Finch in 1826 remarked that the red beds\r\nof Connecticut appear to belong “to the new or variegated sandstone,”\r\nbecause of eight different criteria that he mentions. Of these, but two\r\nare of value in correlation, their “geological position” and the\r\npresence of bones other than fishes. In the Connecticut area, however,\r\nthe geological position cannot be determined even to-day, and in Finch’s\r\ntime the bones of dinosaurs were unknown. Finch then goes on to point\r\nout the occurrences of Old Red Sandstone in Pennsylvania, but all of the\r\nplaces he refers to are either younger or older in time. Here we again\r\nsee the fatality of trying to make positive correlations on the basis of\r\nlithology and color (=10=, 209, 1826). In 1835, however, Hitchcock\r\nshowed that the bones that had been found in 1820 were those of a\r\nsaurian, and accordingly referred the strata of the Connecticut valley\r\nto the New Red Sandstone, a term that then covered both the Permian and\r\nthe Triassic. In 1842, W. B. Rogers referred the beds to the Jurassic,\r\non the basis of plants from Virginia. In 1856, W. C. Redfield\r\n(1789–1857), because of the fishes, advocated a Lias, or Jurassic age,\r\nand proposed the name Newark group for all the Triassic deposits of the\r\nAtlantic border. More recently, on the basis of the plants studied by\r\nNewberry, Fontaine, Sturr, and Ward, and the vertebrates described by\r\nMarsh and Lull, the age has been definitely fixed as Upper Triassic (see\r\nDana’s Manual of Geology, 740, 1895).\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Unearthing of the Paleozoic in North America._\r\n\r\n_Permian of the United States._—In Europe, previous to 1841, the\r\nformations now classed as Permian were included in the New Red\r\nSandstone, and with the Carboniferous were referred to the Secondary. In\r\nthat year Murchison proposed the period term Permian. In 1845 came the\r\nclassic Geology of Russia in Europe and the Ural Mountains, by\r\nMurchison, Keyserling, and De Verneuil. In this great work the authors\r\nseparated out of the New Red the Magnesian Limestone of Great Britain\r\nand the Rothliegende marls, Kupferschiefer, and Zechstein of Germany,\r\nand with other formations of the Urals in Russia, referred them to the\r\nPermian system. This step, one of the most discerning in historical\r\ngeology, was all the more important because they closed the Paleozoic\r\nera with the Permian, beginning the Secondary, or Mesozoic, with the New\r\nRed Sandstone or the Triassic period. There is a good review of this\r\nwork by D. D. Owen (1807–1860) in the Journal for 1847 (=3=, 153).\r\n\r\nOwen, though accepting the Permian system, is not satisfied with its\r\nreference to the Paleozoic, and he sets the matter forth in the Journal\r\n(=3=, 365, 1847). He doubts “the propriety of a classification which\r\nthrows the Permian and Carboniferous systems into the Paleozoic period.”\r\nThis is mainly because there is no “evidence of disturbance or\r\nunconformability” between the Permian and Triassic systems. Rather\r\n“there is so complete a blending of adjacent strata” that it is only in\r\nRussia that the Permian has been distinguished from the Triassic. This\r\nview of Owen’s was not only correct for Russia but even more so for the\r\nAlps and for India, and it has taken a great deal of work and discussion\r\nto fix upon the disconformable contact that distinguishes the Paleozoic\r\nfrom the Mesozoic in these areas. In other words, there was here at this\r\ntime no mountain making. Then Owen goes on to state that because the\r\nPermian of Europe has reptiles, he sees in them decisive Mesozoic\r\nevidence. “These are certainly strong arguments in favor of placing, not\r\nonly the Permian, but also the Carboniferous group in the Mesozoic\r\nperiod, and terminating the Paleozoic division with the commencement of\r\nthe coal measures.” To this harking backward the geologists of the world\r\nhave not agreed, but have followed the better views of Murchison and his\r\nassociates.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 G. G. Shumard discovered, and in 1860 his brother B. F. Shumard\r\n(1820–1869) announced, the presence of Permian strata in the Guadalupe\r\nMountains of Texas, and in 1902 George H. Girty (=14=, 363) confirmed\r\nthis. Girty regards the faunas as younger than any other late Paleozoic\r\nones of America, and says: “For this reason I propose to give them a\r\nregional name, which shall be employed in a force similar to\r\nMississippian and Pennsylvanian.... The term Guadalupian is suggested.”\r\n\r\nG. C. Swallow (1817–1899) in 1858 was the first to announce the presence\r\nof Permian fossils in Kansas, and this led to a controversy between\r\nhimself and F. B. Meek, both claiming the discovery. It is only in more\r\nrecent years that it has been generally admitted that there is Permian\r\nin that state, in Oklahoma, and in Texas. This admission came the more\r\nreadily through the discovery of many reptiles in the red beds of Texas,\r\nand through the work of C. A. White, published in 1891, The Texan\r\nPermian and its Mesozoic Types of Fossils (Bull. U. S. Geological\r\nSurvey, No. =77=).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James Hall]\r\n\r\n_Carboniferous Formations._—The coal formations are noted in a general\r\nway throughout the earliest volumes of the Journal. The first accounts\r\nof the presence of coal, in Ohio, are by Caleb Atwater (=1=, 227, 239,\r\n1819), and S. P. Hildreth (=13=, 38, 40, 1828). The first coal plants to\r\nbe described and illustrated were also from Ohio, in an article by\r\nEbenezer Granger in 1821 (=3=, 5–7). The anthracite field was first\r\ndescribed in 1822 by Zachariah Cist (=4=, 1) and then by Benjamin\r\nSilliman (=10=, 331–351, 1826); that of western Pennsylvania was\r\ndescribed by William Meade in 1828 (=13=, 32).\r\n\r\nThe Lower Carboniferous was first recognized by W. W. Mather in 1838\r\n(=34=, 356). Later, through the work of Alexander Winchell (1824–1891),\r\nbeginning in 1862 (=33=, 352) and continuing until 1871, and through the\r\nsurveys of Iowa (1855–1858), Illinois (essentially the work of A. H.\r\nWorthen, 1858–1888), Ohio (1838, Mather, etc.), and Indiana (Owen, etc.,\r\n1838), there was eventually worked out the following succession:\r\n\r\n         Permian period.\r\n             Upper Barren series.\r\n                 Dunkard group.\r\n                 Washington group.\r\n         Pennsylvanian period.\r\n             Upper Productive Coal series. Monongahela series.\r\n             Lower Barren Coal Measures. Conemaugh series.\r\n             Lower Productive Coal Measures. Allegheny series.\r\n             Pottsville series.\r\n\r\n_The New York System._—We now come to the epochal survey of the State of\r\nNew York, one that established the principles of, and put order into,\r\nAmerican stratigraphy from the Upper Cambrian to the top of the\r\nDevonian. No better area could have been selected for the establishing\r\nof this sequence. This survey also developed a stratigraphic\r\nnomenclature based on New York localities and rock exposures, and made\r\nfull use of the entombed fossils in correlation. Incidentally it\r\ndeveloped and brought into prominence James Hall, who continued the\r\nstratigraphic work so well begun and who also laid the foundation for\r\npaleontology in America, becoming its leading invertebrate worker.\r\n\r\nThis work is reviewed at great length in the Journal in the volumes for\r\n1844–1847 by D. D. Owen. Evidently it followed too new a plan to receive\r\nfulsome praise from conservative Owen, as it should have. He remarks\r\nthat the volumes “are not a little prolix, are voluminous and expensive,\r\nand do not give as clear and connected a view of the geological features\r\nof the state as could be wished.... We are of the opinion that before\r\nthis work can become generally useful and extensively circulated, it\r\nmust be condensed and arranged into one compendious volume” (=46=, 144,\r\n1844). This was never done and yet the work was everywhere accepted at\r\nonce, and to this end undoubtedly Owen’s detailed review helped much.\r\n\r\nThe Natural History Survey of New York was organized in 1836 and\r\ncompleted in 1843. The state was divided into four districts, and to\r\nthese were finally assigned the following experienced geologists. The\r\nsoutheastern part was named the First District, with W. W. Mather\r\n(1804–1859) as geologist; the northeastern quarter was the Second\r\nDistrict, with Ebenezer Emmons (1799–1863) in charge; the central\r\nportion was the Third District, under Lardner Vanuxem (1792–1848); while\r\nthe western part was James Hall’s (1811–1898) Fourth District.\r\nPaleontology for a time was in charge of T. A. Conrad (1830–1877); the\r\nmineralogical and chemical work was in the hands of Lewis C. Beck; the\r\nbotanist was John Torrey; and the zoologist James DeKay.\r\n\r\nThe New York State Survey published six annual reports of 1675 pages\r\noctavo, and four final geological reports with 2079 pages quarto.\r\nFinally in 1846 Emmons added another volume on the soils and rocks of\r\nthe state, in which he also discussed the Taconic and New York systems;\r\nit has 371 pages. With the completion of the first survey, Hall took up\r\nhis life work under the auspices of the state—his monumental work,\r\nPaleontology of New York, in fifteen quarto volumes of 4539 pages and\r\n1081 plates of fossils. In addition to all this, there are his annual\r\nand other reports to the Regents of the State, so that it is safe to say\r\nthat he published not less than 10,000 pages of printed matter on the\r\ngeology and paleontology of North America.\r\n\r\nIn regard to this great series of works, all that can be presented here\r\nis a table of formations as developed by the New York State Survey.\r\nPractically all of its results and formation names have come into\r\ngeneral use, with the exception of the Taconic system of Emmons and the\r\ndivision terms of the New York system. (See p. 88.)\r\n\r\nThe New York State Survey, begun in 1836, was continued by James Hall\r\nfrom 1843 to 1898. During this time he was also state geologist of Iowa\r\n(1855–1858) and Michigan (1862). Since 1898, John M. Clarke has ably\r\ncontinued the Geological Survey of New York, the state which continues\r\nto be, in science and more especially in geology and paleontology, the\r\nforemost in America.\r\n\r\n_Western Extension of the New York system._—Before Hall finished his\r\nfinal report, we find him in 1841 on “a tour of exploration through the\r\nstates of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, a part of Michigan, Kentucky, and\r\nMissouri, and the territories of Iowa and Wisconsin.” This tour is\r\ndescribed in the Journal (=42=, 51, 1842) under the caption “Notes upon\r\nthe Geology of the Western States.” His object was to ascertain how far\r\nthe New York system as the standard of reference “was applicable in the\r\nwestern extension of the series.” In a general way he was very\r\nsuccessful in extending the system to the Mississippi River, and he\r\nclearly saw “a great diminution, first of sandy matter, and next of\r\nshale, as we go westward, and in the whole, a great increase of\r\ncalcareous matter in the same direction.” He also clearly noted the\r\nwarped nature of the strata, the “anticlinal axis,” since known as the\r\nCincinnati and Wabash uplifts and the Ozark dome.\r\n\r\nHall, however, fell into a number of flagrant errors because of a too\r\ngreat reliance on lithologic correlation and supposedly similar\r\nsequence. For instance, the Coal Measures of Pennsylvania were said to\r\ndirectly overlap the Chemung group of southern New York, and now he\r\nfinds the same condition in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, failing to see\r\nthat in most places between the top of the New York system and the Coal\r\nMeasures lay the extensive Mississippian series, one that he generally\r\nconfounded with the Chemung, or included in the “Carboniferous group.”\r\nHe states that the Portage of New York is the same as the Waverly of\r\nOhio, and at Louisville the Middle Devonian waterlime is correlated with\r\nthe similar rock of the New York Silurian. Hall was especially desirous\r\nof fixing the horizon of the Middle Ordovician lead-bearing rocks of\r\nIllinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa, but unfortunately correlated them with\r\nthe Niagaran, while the Middle Devonian about Columbus, Ohio, and\r\nLouisville, Kentucky, he referred to the same horizon. The\r\nGalena-Niagaran error was corrected in 1855, but the Devonian and\r\nMississippian ones remained unadjusted for a long time, and in Iowa\r\nuntil toward the close of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n    _The Geological Column of the New York Geologists of 1842–1843,\r\n                    according to W.

Here he compares it on faunal\r\ngrounds with the Silurian system. A more sustained effort was that of\r\nHall in 1843 (=45=, 157), when he said that the Silurian of Murchison\r\nwas equal to the New York system and embraced the Cambrian, Silurian,\r\nand Devonian, which he considered as forming but one system. Hall in\r\n1844 and Conrad earlier were erroneously regarding the Middle Devonian\r\nof New York (Hamilton) as “an equivalent of the Ludlow rocks of Mr.\r\nMurchison” (=47=, 118, 1844).\r\n\r\nIn 1846 E. P. De Verneuil spent the summer in America with a view to\r\ncorrelating the formations of the New York system with those of Europe.\r\nAt this time he had had a wide field experience in France, Germany, and\r\nRussia, was president of the Geological Society of France, and\r\n“virtually the representative of European geology” (=2=, 153, 1846).\r\nHall says, “No other person could have presented so clear and perfect a\r\ncoup d’oeil.” De Verneuil’s results were translated by Hall and with his\r\nown comments were published in the Journal in 1848 and 1849 under the\r\ntitle “On the Parallelism of the Paleozoic Deposits of North America\r\nwith those of Europe.” De Verneuil was especially struck with the\r\ncomplete development of American Paleozoic deposits and said it was the\r\nbest anywhere. On the other hand, he did not agree with the detailed\r\narrangement of the formations in the various divisions of the New York\r\nsystem, and Hall admitted altogether too readily that the terms were\r\nproposed “as a matter of concession, and it is to be regretted that such\r\nan artificial classification was adopted.” De Verneuil’s correlations\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Lower Silurian system begins with the Potsdam, the analogue of the\r\nObolus sandstone of Russia and Sweden. The Black River and Trenton hold\r\nthe position of the Orthoceras limestones of Sweden and Russia, while\r\nthe Utica and Lorraine are represented by the Graptolite beds of the\r\nsame countries. Both correlations are in partial error. He unites the\r\nChazy, Birdseye, and Black River in one series, and in another the\r\nTrenton, Utica, and Lorraine. Of species common to Europe and America he\r\nmakes out seventeen.\r\n\r\nIn the Upper Silurian system, the Oneida and Shawangunk are taken out of\r\nthe Champlain division, and, with the Medina, are referred to the\r\nSilurian, along with all of the Ontario division plus the Lower\r\nHelderberg. The Clinton is regarded as highest Caradoc or as holding a\r\nstage between that and the Wenlock. The Niagara group is held to be the\r\nexact equivalent of the Wenlock, “while the five inferior groups of the\r\nHelderberg division represent the rocks of Ludlow.” We now know that\r\nthese Helderberg formations are Lower Devonian in age. De Verneuil\r\nunites in one series the Waterlime, Pentamerus, Delthyris, Encrinal, and\r\nUpper Pentamerus. Of identical species there are forty common to Europe\r\nand America.\r\n\r\nThe Devonian system De Verneuil begins, “after much hesitation,” with\r\nthe Oriskany and certainly with the five upper members of Hall’s\r\nHelderberg division, all of the Erie and the Old Red Sandstone. He also\r\nadjusts Hall’s error by placing in the Devonian the Upper Cliff\r\nlimestone of Ohio and Indiana, regarded by the former as Silurian. The\r\nOriskany is correlated with the grauwackes of the Rhine, and the\r\nOnondaga or Corniferous with the lower Eifelian. Cauda-galli, Schoharie,\r\nand Onondaga are united in one series; Marcellus, Hamilton, Tully, and\r\nGenesee in another; and Portage and Chemung in a third. Of species\r\ncommon to Europe and America there are thirty-nine.\r\n\r\nThe Waverly of Ohio and that near Louisville, Kentucky, which Hall had\r\ncalled Chemung, De Verneuil correctly refers to the Carboniferous, but\r\nto this Hall does not consent. De Verneuil points out that there are\r\nthirty-one species in common between Europe and America. “And as to\r\nplants, the immense quantity of terrestrial species identical on the two\r\nsides of the Atlantic, proves that the coal was formed in the\r\nneighborhood of lands already emerged, and placed in similar physical\r\nconditions.”\r\n\r\nAn analysis of the Paleozoic fossils of Europe and America leads De\r\nVerneuil to “the conviction that identical species have lived at the\r\nsame epoch in America and in Europe, that they have had nearly the same\r\nduration, and that they succeeded each other in the same order.” This he\r\nstates is independent of the depth of the seas, and of “the upheavings\r\nwhich have affected the surface of the globe.” The species of a period\r\nbegin and drop out at different levels, and toward the top of a system\r\nthe whole takes on the character of the next one. “If it happens that in\r\nthe two countries a certain number of systems, characterized by the same\r\nfossils, are superimposed in the same order, whatever may be, otherwise,\r\ntheir thickness and the number of physical groups of which they are\r\ncomposed, it is philosophical to consider these systems as parallel and\r\nsynchronous.”\r\n\r\nBecause of the dominance of the sandstones and shales in eastern New\r\nYork, De Verneuil holds that a land lay to the east. The many fucoids\r\nand ripple-marks from the Potsdam to the Portage indicated to him\r\nshallow water and nearness to a shore.\r\n\r\n_The Oldest Geologic Eras._—We have seen in previous pages how the\r\nPrimitive rocks of Arduino and of Werner had been resolved, at least in\r\npart, into the systems of the Paleozoic, but there still remained many\r\nareas of ancient rocks that could not be adjusted into the accepted\r\nscheme. One of the most extensive of these is in Canada, where the\r\nreally Primitive formations, of granites, gneisses, schists, and even\r\nundetermined sediments, abound and are developed on a grander scale than\r\nelsewhere, covering more than two million square miles and overlain\r\nunconformably by the Paleozoic and later rocks. The first to call\r\nattention to them was J. I. Bigsby, a medical staff officer of the\r\nBritish Army, in 1821 (=3=, 254). It was, however, William E. Logan\r\n(1798–1875), the “father of Canadian geology,” who first unravelled\r\ntheir historical sequence. At first he also called them Primary, but\r\nafter much work he perceived in them parallel structures and\r\nmetamorphosed sediments, underlain by and associated with pink granites.\r\nFor the oldest masses, essentially the granites, he proposed the term\r\nLaurentian system (1853, 1863) and for the altered and deformed strata,\r\nthe name Huronian series (1857, 1863). Overlying these unconformably was\r\na third series, the copper-bearing rocks. Since his day a great host of\r\nCanadian and American geologists have labored over this, the most\r\nintricate of all geology, and now we have the following tentative\r\nchronology (Schuchert and Barrell, =38=, 1, 1914):\r\n\r\n            Late Proterozoic era.\r\n                Keweenawan, Animikian and Huronian periods.\r\n            Early Proterozoic era.\r\n                Sudburian period or older Huronian.\r\n            Archeozoic era.\r\n                Grenville series, etc.\r\n            Cosmic history.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _The Taconic System Resurrected._\r\n\r\nThe Taconic system was first announced by Ebenezer Emmons in 1841, and\r\nclearly defined in 1842. It started the most bitter and most protracted\r\ndiscussion in the annals of American geology. After Emmons’s subsequent\r\npublications had put the Taconic system through three phases, Barrande\r\nof Bohemia in 1860–1863 shed a great deal of new and correct light upon\r\nit, affirming in a series of letters to Billings that the Taconic\r\nfossils are like those of his Primordial system, or what we now call the\r\nMiddle Cambrian (=31=, 210, 1861, _et seq._).\r\n\r\nIn a series of articles published by S. W. Ford in the Journal between\r\n1871 and 1886, there was developed the further new fact that in\r\nRensselaer and Columbia counties, New York, the so-called Hudson River\r\ngroup abounds in “Primordial” fossils wholly unlike those of the\r\nPotsdam, and which Ford later on spoke of as belonging to “Lower\r\nPotsdam” time.\r\n\r\nJames D. Dana entered the field of the Taconic area in 1871 and\r\ndemonstrated that the system also abounds in Ordovician fossiliferous\r\nformations. Then came the far-reaching work of Charles D. Walcott,\r\nbeginning in 1886, which showed that all through eastern New York and\r\ninto northern Vermont the Hudson River group and the Taconic system\r\nabound not only in Ordovician but also in Cambrian fossils. Finally in\r\n1888 Dana presented a Brief History of Taconic Ideas, and laid away the\r\nsystem with these words (=36=, 27):\r\n\r\n\r\n  “It is almost fifty years since the Taconic system made its abrupt\r\n  entrance into geological science. Notwithstanding some good points, it\r\n  has been through its greater errors, long a hindrance to progress here\r\n  and abroad ... But, whether the evil or the good has predominated, we\r\n  may now hope, while heartily honoring Professor Emmons for his earnest\r\n  geological labors and his discoveries, that Taconic ideas may be\r\n  allowed to be and remain part of the past.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an epitaph Dana placed over the remains of the Taconic system the\r\nblack-faced numerals =1841–1888=. That the remains of the system,\r\nhowever, and the term Taconic are still alive and demanding a rehearing\r\nis apparent to all interested stratigraphers. This is not the place to\r\nset the matter right, and all that can be done at the present time is to\r\npoint out what are the things that still keep alive Emmons’s system.\r\n\r\nIn the typical area of the Taconic system, i. e., in Rensselaer County,\r\nEmmons in 1844–1846 produced the fossils _Atops trilineatus_ and\r\n_Elliptocephala asaphoides_. S. W. Ford, as stated above, later produced\r\nfrom the same general area many other fossils that he demonstrated to be\r\nolder than the Potsdam sandstone. To this time he gave the name of Lower\r\nPotsdam, thus proving on paleontological grounds that at least some part\r\nof the Taconic system is older than the New York system, and therefore\r\nolder than the Hudson River group of Ordovician age.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 Walcott presented his conclusions in regard to the sequence of\r\nthe strata in the typical Taconic area and to the north and south of it.\r\nHe collected Lower Cambrian fossils at more than one hundred localities\r\n“within the typical Taconic area,” and said that the thickness of his\r\n“terrane No. 5” or “Cambrian (Georgia),” now referable to the Lower\r\nCambrian, is “14,000 feet or more.” He demonstrated that the Lower\r\nCambrian is infolded with the Lower and Middle Ordovician, and confirmed\r\nEmmons’s statement that the former rests upon his Primary or\r\nPre-Cambrian masses. Elsewhere, he writes: “To the west of the Taconic\r\nrange the section passes down through the limestone (3) [of Lower and\r\nMiddle Ordovician age] to the hydromica schists (2) [whose age may also\r\nbe of early Ordovician], and thence to the great development of slates\r\nand shales with their interbedded sparry limestones, calciferous and\r\narenaceous strata, all of which contain more or less of the\r\nOlenellus ... fauna.” He then knew thirty-five species in Washington\r\nCounty, New York (=35=, 401, 1888).\r\n\r\nFinally in 1915 Walcott said that in the Cordilleran area of America\r\nthere was a movement that brought about changes “in the sedimentation\r\nand succession of the faunas which serve to draw a boundary line between\r\nthe Lower and Middle Cambrian series.... The length of this period of\r\ninterruption must have been considerable ... and when connection with\r\nthe Pacific was resumed a new fauna that had been developing in the\r\nPacific was then introduced into the Cordilleran sea and constituted the\r\nMiddle Cambrian fauna. The change in the species from the Lower to the\r\nMiddle Cambrian fauna is very great.” He then goes on to show that in\r\nthe Appalachian geosyncline there was another movement that shut out the\r\nMiddle Cambrian _Paradoxides_ fauna of the Atlantic realm from this\r\ntrough, and all deposition as well.\r\n\r\n_Conclusions._—Accordingly it appears that everywhere in America the\r\nLower Cambrian formations are separated by a land interval of long\r\nduration from those of Middle Cambrian time. These formations therefore\r\nunite into a natural system of rocks or a period of time. Between Middle\r\nand Upper Cambrian time, however, there appears to be a complete\r\ntransition in the Cordilleran trough, binding these two series of\r\ndeposits into one natural or diastrophic system. Hence the writer\r\nproposes that the Lower Cambrian of America be known as the Taconic\r\nsystem. The Middle and Upper Cambrian series can be continued for the\r\npresent under the term Cambrian system, a term, however, that is by no\r\nmeans in good standing for these formations, as will be demonstrated\r\nunder the discussion of the Silurian controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _The Silurian Controversy._\r\n\r\nJust as in America the base of the Paleozoic was involved in a\r\nprotracted controversy, so in England the Cambrian-Silurian succession\r\nwas a subject of long debate between Sedgwick and Murchison, and among\r\nthe succeeding geologists of Europe. The history of the solution is so\r\nwell and justly stated in the Journal by James D. Dana under the title\r\n“Sedgwick and Murchison: Cambrian and Silurian” (=39=, 167, 1890), and\r\nby Sir Archibald Geikie in his Text-book of Geology, 1903, that all that\r\nis here required is to briefly restate it and to bring the solution up\r\nto date.\r\n\r\nAdam Sedgwick (1785–1873) and R. I. Murchison (1792–1871) each began to\r\nwork in the areas of Cambria (Wales) and Siluria (England) in 1831, but\r\nthe terms Cambrian and Silurian were not published until 1835. Murchison\r\nwas the first to satisfactorily work out the sequence of the Silurian\r\nsystem because of the simpler structural and more fossiliferous\r\ncondition of his area. Sedgwick, on the other hand, had his academic\r\nduties to perform at Cambridge University, and being an older and more\r\nconservative man, delayed publishing his final results, because of the\r\nfurther fact that his area was far more deformed and less fossiliferous.\r\nIn 1834 they were working in concert in the Silurian area, and Sedgwick\r\nsaid: “I was so struck by the clearness of the natural sections and the\r\nperfection of his workmanship that I received, I might say, with\r\nimplicit faith everything which he then taught me.... The whole\r\n‘Silurian system’ was by its author placed _above_ the great undulating\r\nslate-rocks of South Wales.” At that time Murchison told Sedgwick that\r\nthe Bala group of the latter, now known to be in the middle of the Lower\r\nSilurian, could not be brought within the limits of the Silurian system,\r\nand added, “I believe it to plunge under the true Llandeilo-flags,” now\r\nplaced next below the Bala and above the Arenig, which at the present is\r\nregarded as at the base of the Ordovician.\r\n\r\nThe Silurian system was defined in print by Murchison in July, 1835, the\r\nUpper Silurian embracing the Ludlow and Wenlock, while the Lower\r\nSilurian was based on the Caradoc and Llandeilo. Murchison’s monumental\r\nwork, The Silurian System, of 100 pages and many plates of fossils,\r\nappeared in 1838.\r\n\r\nThe Cambrian system was described for the first time by Sedgwick in\r\nAugust, 1835, but the completed work—a classic in geology—Synopsis of\r\nthe Classification of the British Palæozoic Rocks, along with M’Coy’s\r\nDescriptions of British Palæozoic Fossils, did not appear until\r\n1852–1855. Sedgwick’s original Upper Cambrian included the greater part\r\nof the chain of the Berwyns, where he said it was connected with the\r\nLlandeilo flags of the Silurian. The Middle Cambrian comprised the\r\nhigher mountains of Cærnarvonshire and Merionethshire, and the Lower\r\nCambrian was said to occupy the southwest coast of Cærnarvonshire, and\r\nto consist of chlorite and mica schists, and some serpentine and\r\ngranular limestone. In 1853 it was seen that the fossiliferous Upper\r\nCambrian included the Arenig, Llandeilo, Bala, Caradoc, Coniston,\r\nHirnant, and Lower Llandovery. On the other hand, it was not until long\r\nafter Murchison and Sedgwick passed away that the Middle and Lower\r\nCambrian were shown to have fossils, but few of those that characterize\r\nwhat is now called Lower, Middle, and Upper Cambrian time.\r\n\r\nNot until long after the original announcement of the Cambrian system\r\ndid Sedgwick become aware “of the unfortunate mischief-involving fact”\r\nthat the most fossiliferous portion of the Cambrian—the Upper\r\nCambrian—and at that time the only part yielding determinable fossils,\r\nwhen compared with the Lower Silurian was seen to be an equivalent\r\nformation but with very different lithologic conditions. He began to see\r\nin 1842 that his Cambrian was in conflict with the Silurian system, and\r\nfour years later there were serious divergencies of views between\r\nhimself and Murchison. The climax of the controversy was attained in\r\n1852, when Sedgwick was extending his Cambrian system upwards to include\r\nthe Bala, Llandeilo, and Caradoc, a proceeding not unlike that of\r\nMurchison, who earlier had been extending his Silurian downward through\r\nall of the fossiliferous Cambrian to the base of the Lingula flags.\r\n\r\nDana in his review of the Silurian-Cambrian controversy states: “The\r\nclaim of a worker to affix a name to a series of rocks first studied and\r\ndefined by him cannot be disputed.” We have seen that Murchison had\r\npriority of publication in his term Silurian over Sedgwick’s Cambrian,\r\nbut that in a complete presentation, both stratigraphically and\r\nfaunally, the former had years of prior definition. What has even more\r\nweight is that geologists nearly everywhere had accepted Murchison’s\r\nSilurian system as founded upon the Lower and Upper Silurian formations.\r\nA nomenclature once widely accepted is almost impossible to dislodge.\r\nHowever, in regard to the controversy it should not be forgotten that it\r\nwas only Murchison’s _Lower_ Silurian that was in conflict with\r\nSedgwick’s _Upper_ Cambrian. As for the rest of the Cambrian, that was\r\nnot involved in the controversy.\r\n\r\nDana goes on to state that science may accept a name, or not, according\r\nas it is, or is not, needed. In the progress of geology, he thought that\r\nthe time had finally been reached when the name Cambrian was a\r\nnecessity, and he included both Cambrian and Silurian in the geological\r\nrecord. The “Silurian,” however, included the Lower and Upper\r\nSilurian—not one system of rocks, but two.\r\n\r\nIt is now twenty-seven years since Dana came to this conclusion, at a\r\ntime when it was believed that there was more or less continuous\r\ndeposition not only between the formations of a system but between the\r\nsystems themselves as well. To-day many geologists hold that in the\r\ncourse of time the oceans pulsate back and forth over the continents,\r\nand accordingly that the sequence of marine sedimentation in most places\r\nmust be much broken, and to-day we know that the breaks or land\r\nintervals in the marine record are most marked between the eras, and\r\nshorter between all or at least most of the periods. Furthermore, in\r\nNorth America, we have learned that the breaks between the systems are\r\nmost marked in the interior of the continent and less so on or toward\r\nits margins.\r\n\r\nHardly any one now questions the fact of a long land interval between\r\nthe Lower Silurian and Upper Silurian in England, and it is to\r\nSedgwick’s credit that he was the first to point out this fact and also\r\nthe presence of an unconformity. It therefore follows that we cannot\r\ncontinue to use Silurian system in the sense proposed by Murchison,\r\nsince it includes two distinct systems or periods. Dana, in the last\r\nedition of his Manual of Geology (1895), also recognizes two systems,\r\nbut curiously he saw nothing incongruous in calling them “Lower Silurian\r\nera” and “Upper Silurian era.” It certainly is not conducive to clear\r\nthinking, however, to refer to two systems by the one name of Silurian\r\nand to speak of them individually as Lower and Upper Silurian, thus\r\ngiving the impression that the two systems are but parts of one—the\r\nSilurian. Each one of the parts has its independent faunal and physical\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nWe must digress a little here and note the work of Joachim Barrande\r\n(1799–1883) in Bohemia. In 1846 he published a short account of the\r\n“Silurian system” of Bohemia, dividing it into étages lettered C to H.\r\nBetween 1852 and 1883 he issued his “Système Silurien du Centre de la\r\nBohème,” in eighteen quarto volumes with 5568 pages of text and 798\r\nplates of fossils—a monumental work unrivalled in paleontology. In the\r\nfirst volume the geology of Bohemia is set forth, and here we see that\r\nétages A and B are Azoic or pre-Cambrian, and C to H make up his\r\nSilurian system. Etage C has his “Primordial fauna,” now known to be of\r\nParadoxides or Middle Cambrian time, while D is Lower Silurian, E is\r\nUpper Silurian, F is Lower Devonian, and G and H are Middle Devonian.\r\nFrom this it appears that Barrande’s Silurian system is far more\r\nextensive than that of Murchison, embracing twice as many periods as\r\nthat of England and Wales.\r\n\r\nAbout 1879 there was in England a nearly general agreement that Cambrian\r\nshould embrace Barrande’s Primordial or Paradoxides faunas, and in the\r\nNorth Wales area be continued up to the top of the Tremadoc slates.\r\nTo-day we would include Middle and Upper Cambrian. Lower Cambrian in the\r\nsense of containing the Olenellus faunas was then unknown in Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nLapworth, recognizing the distinctness of the Lower Silurian as a\r\nsystem, proposed in 1879 to recognize it as such, and named it\r\nOrdovician, restricting Silurian to Murchison’s Upper Silurian. This\r\nterm has not been widely used either in Great Britain or on the\r\nContinent, but in the last twenty years has been accepted more and more\r\nwidely in America. Even here, however, it is in direct conflict with the\r\nterm Champlain, proposed by the New York State Geologist in 1842.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 the International Geological Congress published E. Renevier’s\r\nChronographie Géologique, wherein we find the following:\r\n\r\n                  │Upper or Silurian         │Ludlowian (Murchison\r\n Silurian Period. │  (Murchison, restricted, │  1839).\r\n                  │  1835).                  │\r\n         „        │            „             │Wenlockian (Murchison\r\n                  │                          │  1839).\r\n         „        │            „             │Landoverian (Murchison).\r\n ─────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────\r\n         „        │Middle or Ordovician      │Caradocian (Murchison\r\n                  │  (Lapworth 1879).        │  1839).\r\n         „        │            „             │Landeilian (Murchison\r\n                  │                          │  1839).\r\n         „        │            „             │Arenigian (Sedgwick 1847).\r\n ─────────────────┼──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────\r\n                  │Lower or Cambrian         │\r\n         „        │  (Sedgwick, restricted,  │Potsdamian (Emmons 1838).\r\n                  │  1835).                  │\r\n         „        │            „             │Menevian (Salter and Hicks\r\n                  │                          │  1865).\r\n         „        │            „             │Georgian (Hitchcock 1861).\r\n\r\nRegarding this period, which, by the way, is not very unlike that of\r\nBarrande, Renevier remarks that it is “as important as the Cretaceous or\r\nthe Jurassic. Lapworth even gives it a value of the first order equal to\r\nthe Protozoic era.”\r\n\r\nIn the above there is an obvious objection in the double usage of the\r\nterm Silurian, and this difficulty was met later on in Lapparent’s\r\nTraité by the proposal to substitute Gothlandian for Silurian. Of this\r\nchange Geikie remarks: “Such an arrangement ... might be adopted if it\r\ndid not involve so serious an alteration of the nomenclature in general\r\nuse.” On the other hand, if diastrophism and breaks in the stratigraphic\r\nand faunal sequence are to be the basis for geologic time divisions, we\r\ncannot accept the above scheme, for it recognizes but one period where\r\nthere are at least four in nature.\r\n\r\n_Conclusions._—We have arrived at a time when our knowledge of the\r\nstratigraphic and faunal sequence, plus the orogenic record as\r\nrecognized in the principle of diastrophism, should be reflected in the\r\nterminology of the geologic time-table. It would be easy to offer a\r\nsatisfactory nomenclature if we were not bound by the law of priority in\r\npublication, and if no one had the geologic chronology of his own time\r\ningrained in his memory. In addition, the endless literature, with its\r\naccepted nomenclature, bars our way. Therefore with a view of creating\r\nthe least change in geologic nomenclature, and of doing the greatest\r\njustice to our predecessors that the present conditions of our knowledge\r\nwill allow, the following scheme is offered:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Silurian period. Llandovery to top of Ludlow in Europe.\r\n  Alexandrian-Cataract-Medina to top of Manlius in America.\r\n\r\n  Champlain (1842) or Ordovician (1879) period. Arenig to top of Caradoc\r\n  in Europe. Beekmantown to top of Richmondian in America.\r\n\r\n  Cambrian period. In the Atlantic realm, begins with the Paradoxides,\r\n  and in the Pacific, with the Bathyuriscus and Ogygopsis faunas. The\r\n  close is involved in Ulrich’s provisionally defined Ozarkian system.\r\n  When the latter is established, the Ozarkian period will hold the time\r\n  between the Ordovician and the Cambrian.\r\n\r\n  Taconic period. For the world-wide Olenellus or Mesonacidæ faunas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Paleogeography._\r\n\r\nWhen geologists began to perceive the vast significance of Hutton’s\r\ndoctrine that “the ruins of an earlier world lie beneath the secondary\r\nstrata,” and that great masses of bedded rocks are separated from one\r\nanother by periods of mountain making and by erosion intervals, it was\r\nnatural for them to look for the lands that had furnished the debris of\r\nthe accumulated sediments. In this way paleogeography had its origin,\r\nbut it was at first of a descriptive and not of a cartographic nature.\r\n\r\nThe word paleogeography was proposed by T. Sterry Hunt in 1872 in a\r\npaper entitled “The Paleogeography of the North American Continent,” and\r\npublished in the Journal of the American Geographical Society for that\r\nyear. It has to do, he says, with the “geographical history of these\r\nancient geological periods.” It was again prominently used by Robert\r\nEtheridge in his presidential address before the Geological Society of\r\nLondon in 1881. Since Canu’s use of the term in 1896, it has been\r\nfrequently seen in print, and now is generally adopted to signify the\r\ngeography of geologic time.\r\n\r\nThe French were the first to make paleogeographic maps, and Jules Marcou\r\nrelates in 1866 that Elie de Beaumont, as early as March, 1831, in his\r\ncourse in the College of France and at the Paris School of Mines, used\r\nto outline the relation of the lands and the seas in the center of\r\nEurope at the different great geologic periods. His first printed\r\npaleogeographic map appeared in 1833, and was of early Tertiary time.\r\nOther maps by Beaumont were published by Beudant in 1841–1842. The\r\nSicilian geologist Gemmellaro published six maps of his country in 1834,\r\nand the Englishman De La Beche had one in the same year. In America the\r\nfirst to show such maps was Arnold Guyot in his Lowell lectures of 1848.\r\nJames D. Dana published three in the 1863 edition of his Manual of\r\nGeology. Of world paleogeographic maps, Jules Marcou produced the first\r\nof Jurassic time, publishing it in France in 1866, but the most\r\ncelebrated of these early attempts was the one by Neumayr published in\r\n1883 in connection with his Ueber klimatische Zonen während der Jura-\r\nund Kreidezeit.\r\n\r\nThe first geologist to produce a series of maps showing the progressive\r\ngeologic geography of a given area was Jukes-Brown, who in the volume\r\nentitled “The Building of the British Isles,” 1888, included fifteen\r\nsuch maps. Karpinsky published fourteen maps of Russia, and in 1896 Canu\r\nin his Essai de paléogéographie has fifty-seven of France and Belgium.\r\nLapparent’s Traité of 1906 is famous for paleogeographic maps, for he\r\nhas twenty-three of the world, thirty-four of Europe, twenty-five of\r\nFrance, and ten taken from other authors. Schuchert in 1910 published\r\nfifty-two to illustrate the paleogeography of North America, and also\r\ngave an extended list of such published maps. Another article on the\r\nsubject is by Th. Arldt, “Zur Geschichte der Paläogeographischen\r\nRekonstructionen,” published in 1914. Edgar Dacqué in 1913 also produced\r\na list in his Paläogeographischen Karten, and two years later appeared\r\nhis book of 500 pages, Grundlagen und Methoden der Paläogeographie,\r\nwhere the entire subject is taken up in detail.\r\n\r\n_Conclusions._—Since 1833 there have been published not less than 500\r\ndifferent paleogeographic maps, and of this number about 210 relate to\r\nNorth America. Nevertheless paleogeography is still in its infancy, and\r\nmost maps embrace too much geologic time, all of them tens of thousands,\r\nand some of them millions of years. The geographic maps of the present\r\nshow the conditions of the strand-lines of to-day, and those made fifty\r\nyears ago have to be revised again and again if they are to be of value\r\nto the mariner and merchant. Therefore in our future paleogeographic\r\nmaps the tendency must ever be toward smaller amounts of geologic time,\r\nif we are to show the actual relation of water to land and the movements\r\nof the periodic floodings. Moreover, the ancient shore lines are all\r\nmore or less hypothetic and are drawn in straight or sweeping curves,\r\nunlike modern strands with their bays, deltas, and headlands, and the\r\nancient lands are featureless plains. We must also pay more attention to\r\nthe distribution of brackish- and fresh-water deposits. The periodically\r\nrising mountains will be the first topographic features to be shown upon\r\nthe ancient lands, and then more and more of the drainage and the\r\ngeneral climatic conditions must be portrayed. In the seas, depth,\r\ntemperature, and currents are yet to be deciphered. Finally, other base\r\nmaps than those of the geography of to-day will have to be made,\r\nallowing for the compression of the mountainous areas, if we are to show\r\nthe true geographic configurations of the lands and seas of any given\r\ngeologic time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Paleometeorology._\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Laplacian theory, announced at the beginning of\r\nthe nineteenth century, all of the older geologists held that the earth\r\nbegan as a hot star, and that in the course of time it slowly cooled and\r\nfinally attained its present zonal cold to tropical climatic conditions.\r\nThat the earth had very recently passed through a much colder climate, a\r\nglacial one, came into general acceptance only during the latter half of\r\nthe previous century.\r\n\r\n_Rise._—Our knowledge of glacial climates had its origin in the Alps,\r\nthat wonderland of mountains and glaciers. The rise of this knowledge in\r\nthe Alps is told in a charming and detailed manner by that erratic\r\nFrench-American geologist, Jules Marcou (1824–1898), in his Life,\r\nLetters, and Works of Louis Agassiz, 1896. He relates that the Alpine\r\nchamois hunter Perraudin in 1815 directed the attention of the engineer\r\nDe Charpentier to the fact “that the large boulders perched on the sides\r\nof the Alpine valleys were carried and left there by glaciers.” For a\r\nlong time the latter thought the conclusion extravagant, and in the\r\nmeantime Perraudin told the same thing to another engineer, Venetz. He,\r\nin 1829, convinced of the correctness of the chamois hunter’s views,\r\npresented the matter before the Swiss naturalists then meeting at St.\r\nBernard’s. Venetz “told the Society that his observations led him to\r\nbelieve that the whole Valais has been formerly covered by an immense\r\nglacier and that it even extended outside of the canton, covering all\r\nthe Canton de Vaud, as far as the Jura Mountains, carrying the boulders\r\nand erratic materials, which are now scattered all over the large Swiss\r\nvalley.” Eight years earlier, in 1821, similar views had been presented\r\nby the same modest naturalist before the Helvetic Society, but it was\r\nnot until 1833 that De Charpentier found the manuscript and had it\r\npublished. Venetz’s conclusions were that all of the glaciers of the\r\nBagnes valley “have very recognizable moraines, which are about a league\r\nfrom the present ice.” “The moraines ... date from an epoch which is\r\nlost in the night of time.” Then in 1834 De Charpentier read a paper\r\nbefore the same society, meeting at Lucerne. “Seldom, if ever, has such\r\na small memoir so deeply excited the scientific world. It was received\r\nat first with incredulity and even scorn and mockery, Agassiz being\r\namong its opponents.” The paper was published in 1835, first at Paris,\r\nthen at Geneva, and finally in Germany. It “attracted much attention,\r\nand the smile of incredulity with which it was received when read at\r\nLucerne soon changed into a desire to know more about it.”\r\n\r\nLouis Agassiz (1807–1873), who had long been acquainted with his\r\ncountryman, De Charpentier, spent several months with him in 1836, and\r\ntogether they studied the glaciers of the Alps. Agassiz was at first\r\n“adverse to the hypothesis, and did not believe in the great extension\r\nof glaciers and their transportation of boulders, but on the contrary,\r\nwas a partisan of Lyell’s theory of transport by icebergs and\r\nice-cakes ... but from being an adversary of the glacial theory, he\r\nreturned to Neuchâtel an enthusiastic convert to the views of Venetz and\r\nDe Charpentier.... With his power of quick perception, his unmatched\r\nmemory, his perspicacity and acuteness, his way of classifying, judging\r\nand marshalling facts, Agassiz promptly learned the whole mass of\r\nirresistible arguments collected patiently during seven years by De\r\nCharpentier and Venetz, and with his insatiable appetite and that\r\nfaculty of assimilation which he possessed in such a wonderful degree,\r\nhe digested the whole doctrine of the glaciers in a few weeks.”\r\n\r\nIn July, 1837, Agassiz presented as his presidential address before the\r\nHelvetic Society his memorable “Discours de Neuchâtel,” which was “the\r\nstarting point of all that has been written on the Ice-age,”—a term\r\ncoined at the time by his friend Schimper, a botanist. The first part of\r\nthis address is reprinted in French in Marcou’s book on Agassiz. The\r\naddress was received with astonishment, much incredulity, and\r\nindifference. Among the listeners was the great German geologist Von\r\nBuch, who “was horrified, and with his hands raised towards the sky, and\r\nhis head bowed to the distant Bernese Alps, exclaimed: ‘O Sancte de\r\nSaussure, ora pro nobis!’” Even De Charpentier “was not gratified to see\r\nhis glacial theory mixed with rather uncalled for biological problems,\r\nthe connection of which with the glacial age was more than problematic.”\r\nAgassiz was then a Cuvierian catastrophist and creationist, and advanced\r\nthe idea of a series of glacial ages to explain the destruction of the\r\ngeologic succession of faunas! Curiously, this theory was at once\r\naccepted by the American paleontologist T. A. Conrad (=35=, 239, 1839).\r\n\r\nThe classics in glacial geology are Agassiz’s Etudes sur les Glaciers,\r\n1840, and De Charpentier’s Essai sur les Glaciers, 1841. Of the latter\r\nbook, Marcou states that it has been said: “It is impossible to be truly\r\na geologist without having read and studied it.” In the English language\r\nthere is Tyndall’s Glaciers of the Alps, 1860.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the ideas in regard to Pleistocene glaciation is\r\npresented in the following chapter by H. E. Gregory.\r\n\r\n_Older Glacial Climates._—Hardly had the Pleistocene glacial climate\r\nbeen proved, when geologists began to point out the possibility of even\r\nearlier ones. An enthusiastic Scotch writer, Sir Andrew Ramsay, in 1855\r\ndescribed certain late Paleozoic conglomerates of middle England, which\r\nhe said were of glacial origin, but his evidence, though never\r\ncompletely gainsaid, has not been generally accepted. In the following\r\nyear, an Englishman, Doctor W. T. Blanford, said that the Talchir\r\nconglomerates of central and southern India were of glacial origin, and\r\nsince then the evidence for a Permian glacial climate has been steadily\r\naccumulating. Africa is the land of tillites, and here in 1870\r\nSutherland pointed out that the conglomerates of the Karroo formation\r\nwere of glacial origin. Australia also has Permian glacial deposits, and\r\nthey are known widely in eastern Brazil, the Falkland Islands, the\r\nvicinity of Boston, and elsewhere. So convincing is this testimony that\r\nall geologists are now ready to accept the conclusion that a glacial\r\nclimate was as wide-spread in early Permian time as was that of the\r\nPleistocene.[3]\r\n\r\nIn South Africa, beneath the marine Lower Devonian, occurs the Table\r\nMountain series, 5000 feet thick. The series is essentially one of\r\nquartzites, with zones of shales or slates and with striated pebbles up\r\nto 15 inches long. The latter occur in pockets and seem to be of glacial\r\norigin. There are here no typical tillites, and no striated undergrounds\r\nhave so far been found. While the evidence of the deposits appears to\r\nfavor the conclusion that the Table Mountain strata were laid down in\r\ncold waters with floating ice derived from glaciers, it is as yet\r\nimpossible to assign these sediments a definite geologic age. They are\r\ncertainly not younger than the Lower Devonian, but it has not yet been\r\nestablished to what period of the early Paleozoic they belong.\r\n\r\nIn southeastern Australia occur tillites of wide distribution that lie\r\nconformably beneath, but sharply separated from the fossiliferous marine\r\nLower Cambrian strata. David (1907), Howchin (1908), and other\r\nAustralian geologists think they are of Cambrian time, but to the writer\r\nthey seem more probably late Proterozoic in age. In arctic Norway Reusch\r\ndiscovered unmistakable tillites in 1891, and this occurrence was\r\nconfirmed by Strahan in 1897. It is not yet certainly known what their\r\nage is, but it appears to be late Proterozoic rather than early\r\nPaleozoic. Other undated Proterozoic tillites occur in China (Willis and\r\nBlackwelder 1907), Africa (Schwarz 1906), India (Vredenburg 1907),\r\nCanada (Coleman 1908), and possibly in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe oldest known tillites are described by Coleman in 1907, and occur at\r\nthe base of the Lower Huronian or in early Proterozoic time. They extend\r\nacross northern Ontario for 1000 miles, and from the north shore of Lake\r\nHuron northward for 750 miles.\r\n\r\n_Fossils as Climatic Indexes._—Paleontologists have long been aware that\r\nvariations in the climates of the past are indicated by the fossils, and\r\nNeumayr in 1883 brought the evidence together in his study of climatic\r\nzones mentioned elsewhere. Plants, and corals, cephalopods, and\r\nforaminifers among marine animals, have long been recognized as\r\nparticularly good “life thermometers.” In fact, all fossils are climatic\r\nindicators to some extent, and a good deal of evidence concerning\r\npaleometeorology has been discerned in them. This evidence is briefly\r\nstated in the paper by Schuchert already alluded to, and in W. D.\r\nMatthew’s Climate and Evolution, 1915.\r\n\r\n_Sediments as Climatic Indexes._—Johannes Walther in the third part of\r\nhis Einleitung—Lithogenesis der Gegenwart, 1894—is the first one to\r\ndecidedly direct attention to the fact that the sediments also have\r\nwithin themselves a climatic record. In America Joseph Barrell has since\r\n1907 written much on the same subject. On the other hand, the periodic\r\nfloodings of the continents by the oceans, and the making of mountains,\r\ndue to the periodic shrinkage of the earth, as expressed in T. C.\r\nChamberlin’s principle of diastrophism and in his publications since\r\n1897, are other criteria for estimating the climates of the past.\r\n\r\n_Conclusions._—In summation of this subject Schuchert says:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The marine ‘life thermometer’ indicates vast stretches of time of\r\n  mild to warm and equable temperatures, with but slight zonal\r\n  differences between the equator and the poles. The great bulk of\r\n  marine fossils are those of the shallow seas, and the evolutionary\r\n  changes recorded in these ‘medals of creation’ are slight throughout\r\n  vast lengths of time that are punctuated by short but decisive periods\r\n  of cooled waters and great mortality, followed by quick evolution, and\r\n  the rise of new stocks. The times of less warmth are the _miotherm_\r\n  and those of greater heat the _pliotherm_ periods of Ramsay.\r\n\r\n  On the land the story of the climatic changes is different, but in\r\n  general the equability of the temperature simulates that of the\r\n  oceanic areas. In other words, the lands also had long-enduring times\r\n  of mild to warm climates. Into the problem of land climates, however,\r\n  enter other factors that are absent in the oceanic regions, and these\r\n  have great influence upon the climates of the continents. Most\r\n  important of these is the periodic warm-water inundation of the\r\n  continents by the oceans, causing insular climates that are milder and\r\n  moister. With the vanishing of the floods somewhat cooler and\r\n  certainly drier climates are produced. The effects of these periodic\r\n  floods must not be underestimated, for the North American continent\r\n  was variably submerged at least seventeen times, and over an area of\r\n  from 154,000 to 4,000,000 square miles.\r\n\r\n  When to these factors is added the effect upon the climate caused by\r\n  the periodic rising of mountain chains, it is at once apparent that\r\n  the lands must have had constantly varying climates. In general the\r\n  temperature fluctuations seem to have been slight, but geographically\r\n  the climates varied between mild to warm pluvial, and mild to cool\r\n  arid. The arid factor has been of the greatest import to the organic\r\n  world of the lands. Further, when to all of these causes is added the\r\n  fact that during emergent periods the formerly isolated lands were\r\n  connected by land bridges, permitting intermigration of the land\r\n  floras and faunas, with the introduction of their parasites and\r\n  parasitic diseases, we learn that while the climatic environment is of\r\n  fundamental importance it is not the only cause for the more rapid\r\n  evolution of terrestrial life....\r\n\r\n  Briefly, then, we may conclude that the markedly varying climates of\r\n  the past seem to be due primarily to periodic changes in the\r\n  topographic form of the earth’s surface, plus variations in the amount\r\n  of heat stored by the oceans. The causation for the warmer\r\n  interglacial climates is the most difficult of all to explain, and it\r\n  is here that factors other than those mentioned may enter.\r\n\r\n  Granting all this, there still seems to lie back of all these theories\r\n  a greater question connected with the major changes in\r\n  paleometeorology. This is: What is it that forces the earth’s\r\n  topography to change with varying intensity at irregularly rhythmic\r\n  intervals?... Are we not forced to conclude that the earth’s shape\r\n  changes periodically in response to gravitative forces that alter the\r\n  body-form?”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Evolution._\r\n\r\nModern evolution, or the theory of life continuously descending from\r\nlife with change, may be said to have had its first marked development\r\nin Comte de Buffon (1707–1788), a man of wealth and station, yet an\r\nindustrious compiler, a brilliant writer, and a popularizer of science.\r\nHe was not, however, a true scientific investigator, and his monument to\r\nfame is his Histoire Naturelle, in forty-four volumes, 1749–1804. A. S.\r\nPackard in his book on Lamarck, his Life and Work, 1901, concludes in\r\nregard to Buffon as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The impression left on the mind, after reading Buffon, is that even\r\n  if he threw out these suggestions and then retracted them, from fear\r\n  of annoyance or even persecution from the bigots of his time, he did\r\n  not himself always take them seriously, but rather jotted them down as\r\n  passing thoughts.... They appeared thirty-four years before Lamarck’s\r\n  theory, and though not epoch-making, they are such as will render the\r\n  name of Buffon memorable for all time.”\r\n\r\n\r\nChevalier de Lamarck (1744–1829) may justly be regarded as the founder\r\nof the doctrine of modern evolution. Previous to 1794 he was a believer\r\nin the fixity of species, but by 1800 he stood definitely in favor of\r\nevolution. Locy in his Biology and its Makers, 1908, states his theories\r\nin the following simplified form:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Variations of organs, according to Lamarck, arise in animals mainly\r\n  through use and disuse, and new organs have their origin in a\r\n  physiological need. A new need felt by the animal [due to new\r\n  conditions in its life, or the environment] expresses itself on the\r\n  organism, stimulating growth and adaptations in a particular\r\n  direction.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Lamarck, “inheritance was a simple, direct transmission of those\r\nsuperficial changes that arise in organs within the lifetime of an\r\nindividual owing to use and disuse.” This part of his theory has come to\r\nbe known as “the inheritance of acquired characters.”\r\n\r\nGeorges Cuvier (1769–1832), a peer of France, was a decided believer in\r\nthe fixity of species and in their creation through divine acts. In 1796\r\nhe began to see that among the fossils so plentiful about Paris many\r\nwere of extinct forms, and later on that there was a succession of\r\nwholly extinct faunas. This at first puzzling phenomenon he finally came\r\nto explain by assuming that the earth had gone through a series of\r\ncatastrophes, of which the Deluge was the most recent but possibly not\r\nthe last. With each catastrophe all life was blotted out, and a new\r\nthough improved set of organisms was created by divine acts. The\r\nCuvierian theory of catastrophism was widely accepted during the first\r\nhalf of the nineteenth century, and in America Louis Agassiz was long\r\nits greatest exponent. It was this theory and the dominance of the\r\nbrilliant Cuvier, not only in science but socially as well, that blotted\r\nout the far more correct views of the more philosophical Lamarck, who\r\nheld that life throughout the ages had been continuous and that through\r\nindividual effort and the inheritance of acquired characters had evolved\r\nthe wonderful diversity of the present living world.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 there was a public debate at Paris between Cuvier and Geoffroy\r\nSaint-Hilaire, the one holding to the views of the fixity of species and\r\ncreation, the other that life is continuous and evolves into better\r\nadapted forms. Cuvier, a gifted speaker and the greatest debater zoology\r\never had, with an extraordinary memory that never failed him, defeated\r\nSaint-Hilaire in each day’s debate, although the latter was in the\r\nright.\r\n\r\nA book that did a great deal to prepare the English-speaking people for\r\nthe coming of evolution was “Vestiges of Creation,” published in 1844 by\r\nan unknown author. In Darwin’s opinion, “the work, from its powerful and\r\nbrilliant style ... has done excellent service ... in thus preparing the\r\nground for the reception of analogous views.” This book was recommended\r\nto the readers of the Journal (=48=, 395, 1845) with the editorial\r\nremark that “we cannot subscribe to all of the author’s views.”\r\n\r\nWe can probably best illustrate the opinions of Americans on the\r\nquestion of evolution just before the appearance of Darwin’s great work\r\nby directing attention to James D. Dana’s Thoughts on Species (=24=,\r\n305, 1857). After reading this article and others of a similar nature by\r\nAgassiz, one comes to the opinion that unconsciously both men are\r\nproving evolution, but consciously they are firm creationists. It is\r\nastonishing that with their extended and minute knowledge of living\r\norganisms and their philosophic type of mind neither could see the true\r\nsignificance of the imperceptible transitions between some species,\r\nwhich if they do not actually pass into, at least shade towards, one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nDana speaks of “the endless diversities in individuals” that compose a\r\nspecies, and then states that a living species, like an inorganic one,\r\n“is based on a specific amount or condition of concentered force defined\r\nin the act or law of creation.” Species, he says, are permanent, and\r\nhybrids “cannot seriously trifle with the true units of nature, and at\r\nthe best, can only make temporary variations.” “We have therefore reason\r\nto believe from man’s fertile intermixture, that he is one in species:\r\nand that all organic species are divine appointments which cannot be\r\nobliterated, unless by annihilating the individuals representing the\r\nspecies.”\r\n\r\nThrough the activities of the French the world was prepared for the\r\nreception of evolution, and now it was already in the minds of many\r\nadvanced thinkers. In 1860 Asa Gray sent to the editor of the Journal\r\n(=29=, 1) an article by the English botanist, Joseph D. Hooker, entitled\r\n“On the Origination and Distribution of Species,” with these significant\r\nremarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The essay cannot fail to attract the immediate and profound attention\r\n  of scientific men.... It has for some time been manifest that a\r\n  re-statement of the Lamarckian hypothesis is at hand. We have this, in\r\n  an improved and truly scientific form, in the theories which, recently\r\n  propounded by Mr. Darwin, followed by Mr. Wallace, are here so ably\r\n  and altogether independently maintained. When these views are fully\r\n  laid before them, the naturalists of this country will be able to take\r\n  part in the interesting discussion which they will not fail to call\r\n  forth.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHooker took up a study of the flora of Tasmania, of which the above\r\ncited article is but a chapter, with a view to trying out Darwin’s\r\ntheory, and he now accepts it. He says, “Species are derivative and\r\nmutable.” “The limits of the majority of species are so undefinable that\r\nfew naturalists are agreed upon them.”\r\n\r\nAsa Gray had received from Darwin an advance copy of the book that was\r\nto revolutionize the thought of the world, and at once wrote for the\r\nJournal a Review of Darwin’s Theory on the Origin of Species by means of\r\nNatural Selection (=29=, 153, 1860). This is a splendid, critical but\r\njust, scientific review of Darwin’s epoch-making book. Evidently views\r\nsimilar to those, of the English scientist had long been in the mind of\r\nGray, for he easily and quickly mastered the work. He is easy on Dana’s\r\nThoughts on Species, which were idealistic and not in harmony with the\r\nnaturalistic views of Darwin. On the other hand, he contrasts Darwin’s\r\nviews at length with those of the creationists as exemplified by Louis\r\nAgassiz, and says “The widest divergence appears.”\r\n\r\nGray says in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The gist of Mr. Darwin’s work is to show that such varieties are\r\n  gradually diverged into species and genera through natural selection;\r\n  that natural selection is the inevitable result of the struggle for\r\n  existence which all living things are engaged in; and that this\r\n  struggle is an unavoidable consequence of several natural causes, but\r\n  mainly of the high rate at which all organic beings tend to increase.\r\n\r\n  Darwin is confident that intermediate forms must have existed; that in\r\n  the olden times when the genera, the families and the orders diverged\r\n  from their parent stocks, gradations existed as fine as those which\r\n  now connect closely related species with varieties. But they have\r\n  passed and left no sign. The geological record, even if all displayed\r\n  to view, is a book from which not only many pages, but even whole\r\n  alternate chapters have been lost out, or rather which were never\r\n  printed from the autographs of nature. The record was actually made in\r\n  fossil lithography only at certain times and under certain conditions\r\n  (i.e., at periods of slow subsidence and places of abundant sediment);\r\n  and of these records all but the last volume is out of print; and of\r\n  its pages only local glimpses have been obtained. Geologists, except\r\n  Lyell, will object to this,—some of them moderately, others with\r\n  vehemence. Mr. Darwin himself admits, with a candor rarely displayed\r\n  on such occasions, that he should have expected more geological\r\n  evidence of transition than he finds, and that all the most eminent\r\n  paleontologists maintain the immutability of species.\r\n\r\n  The general fact, however, that the fossil fauna of each period as a\r\n  whole is nearly intermediate in character between the preceding and\r\n  the succeeding faunas, is much relied on. We are brought one step\r\n  nearer to the desired inference by the similar ‘fact,’ insisted on by\r\n  all paleontologists, that fossils from two consecutive formations are\r\n  far more closely related to each other, than are the fossils of two\r\n  remote formations.\r\n\r\n  It is well said that all organic beings have been formed on two great\r\n  laws; Unity of type, and Adaptation to the conditions of existence....\r\n  Mr. Darwin harmonizes and explains them naturally. Adaptation to the\r\n  conditions of existence is the result of Natural Selection; Unity of\r\n  type, of unity of descent.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGray’s article was soon followed by another one from Agassiz on\r\nIndividuality and Specific Differences among Acalephs, but the running\r\ntitle is “Prof. Agassiz on the Origin of Species” (=30=, 142, 1860).\r\nAgassiz stoutly maintains his well known views, and concludes as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Were the transmutation theory true, the geological record should\r\n  exhibit an uninterrupted succession of types blending gradually into\r\n  one another. The fact is that throughout all geological times each\r\n  period is characterized by definite specific types, belonging to\r\n  definite genera, and these to definite families, referable to definite\r\n  orders, constituting definite classes and definite branches, built\r\n  upon definite plans. Until the facts of Nature are shown to have been\r\n  mistaken by those who have collected them, and that they have a\r\n  different meaning from that now generally assigned to them, I shall\r\n  therefore consider the transmutation theory as a scientific mistake,\r\n  untrue in its facts, unscientific in its method, and mischievous in\r\n  its tendency.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDana, in reviewing Huxley’s well known book, Man’s Place in Nature\r\n(=35=, 451, 1863), holds that man is apart from brute nature because man\r\nexhibits “extreme cephalization” in that he has arms that no longer are\r\nused in locomotion but go rather with the head, and because he has a far\r\nhigher mentality and speech. As for the Darwinian theory, the evidence,\r\nhe says, “comes from lower departments of life, and is acknowledged by\r\nits advocates to be exceedingly scanty and imperfect.”\r\n\r\nThe growth of evolution is set forth in the Journal in Asa Gray’s\r\narticle on Charles Darwin (=24=, 453, 1882), which speaks of the latter\r\nas “the most celebrated man of science of the nineteenth century,” and,\r\nin addition, as “one of the most kindly and charming, unaffected,\r\nsimple-hearted, and lovable of men.” In regard to the rise of evolution\r\nin America, more can be had from Dana’s paper on Asa Gray (=35=, 181,\r\n1888). Here we read, as a sequel to his Thoughts on Species, that the\r\n“paper may be taken, perhaps, as a culmination of the past, just as the\r\nnew future was to make its appearance.” Finally, in this connection\r\nthere should be mentioned O. C. Marsh’s paper on Thomas Henry Huxley\r\n(=50=, 177, 1895), wherein is recorded the latter’s share in the\r\nupbuilding of the evolutionary theory.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that originally Dana was a creationist, but in the course\r\nof his long and fruitful life he gradually became an evolutionist, and\r\nrather a Neo-Lamarckian than a Darwinian. This change may be traced in\r\nthe various editions of his Manual of Geology, and in the last edition\r\nof 1895 he says his “speculative conclusions” of 1852 in regard to the\r\norigin of species are not in “accord with the author’s present\r\njudgment.” “The evidence in favor of evolution by variation is now\r\nregarded as essentially complete.” On the other hand, while man is\r\n“unquestionably” closely related in structure to the man-apes, yet he is\r\nnot linked to them but stands apart, through “the intervention of a\r\nPower above Nature.... Believing that Nature exists through the will and\r\never-acting power of the Divine Being, and ... that the whole Universe\r\nis not merely dependent on, but actually is, the Will of one Supreme\r\nIntelligence, Nature, with Man as its culminant species, is no longer a\r\nmystery.”\r\n\r\nIn America most of the paleontologists are Neo-Lamarckian, a school that\r\nwas developed independently by E. D. Cope (1840–1897) through the\r\nvertebrate evidence, and by Alpheus Hyatt (1838–1902) mainly on the\r\nevidence of the ammonites. They hold that variations and acquired\r\ncharacters arise through the effects of the environment, the mechanics\r\nof the organism resulting from the use and disuse of organs, etc. One of\r\nthe leading exponents of this school is A. S. Packard, whose book on\r\nLamarck, His Life and Work, 1901, fully explains the doctrines of the\r\nNeo-Lamarckians.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _The Growth of Invertebrate Paleontology._\r\n\r\nHow and by whom paleontology has been developed has been fully stated in\r\nthe Journal in a very clear manner by Professor Marsh in his memorable\r\npresidential address of 1879, History and Methods of Palæontological\r\nDiscovery (=18=, 323, 1879), and by Karl von Zittel in his most\r\ninteresting book, History of Geology and Palæontology, 1901. In this\r\ndiscussion we shall largely follow Marsh.\r\n\r\nThe science of paleontology has passed through four periods, the first\r\nof them the long _Mystic period_ extending up to the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century, when the idea that fossils were once living things\r\nwas only rarely perceived. The second period was the _Diluvial period_\r\nof the eighteenth century, when nearly everyone regarded the fossils as\r\nremains of the Noachian deluge. With the beginnings of the nineteenth\r\ncentury there arose in western Europe the knowledge that fossils are the\r\n“medals of creation” and that they have a chronogenetic significance;\r\nalso that life had been periodically destroyed through world-wide\r\nconvulsions in nature. From about 1800 to 1860 was the time of the\r\ncreationists and catastrophists, which may be known as the _Catastrophic\r\nperiod_. The fourth period began in 1860 with Darwin’s Origin of\r\nSpecies. Since that time the theory of evolution has pervaded all work\r\nin paleontology, and accordingly this time may be known as the\r\n_Evolutionary period_.\r\n\r\n_Mystic Period._—The Mystic period in paleontology begins with the\r\nGreeks, five centuries before the present era, and continues down to the\r\nbeginning of the seventeenth century of our time. Some correctly saw\r\nthat the fossils were once living marine animals, and that the sea had\r\nbeen where they now occur. Others interpreted fossil mammal bones as\r\nthose of human giants, the Titans, but the Aristotelian view that they\r\nwere of spontaneous generation through the hidden forces of the earth\r\ndominated all thought for about twenty centuries.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century canals were being dug in Northern Italy, and\r\nthe many fossils so revealed led to a fierce discussion as to their\r\nactual nature. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) opposed the commonly\r\naccepted view of their spontaneous generation and said that they were\r\nthe remains of once living animals and that the sea had been where they\r\noccur. “You tell me,” he said, “that Nature and the influence of the\r\nstars have formed these shells in the mountains; then show me a place in\r\nthe mountains where the stars at the present day make shelly forms of\r\ndifferent ages, and of different species in the same place.” However,\r\nnothing came of his teachings and those of his countryman Fracastorio\r\n(1483–1553), who further ridiculed the idea that they were the remains\r\nof the deluge. The first mineralogist, Agricola, described them as\r\nminerals—fossilia—and said that they arose in the ground from fatty\r\nmatter set in fermentation by heat. Others said that they were freaks of\r\nnature. Martin Lister (1638–1711) figured fossils side by side with\r\nliving shells to show that they were extinct forms of life. In the\r\nseventeenth century, and especially in Italy and Germany, many books\r\nwere published on fossils, some with illustrations so accurate that the\r\nspecies can be recognized to-day. Finally, toward the close of this\r\ncentury the influence of Aristotle and the scholastic tendency to\r\ndisputation came more or less to an end. Fossils were already to many\r\nnaturalists once living plants and animals. Marsh states: “The many\r\ncollections of fossils that had been brought together, and the\r\nillustrated works that had been published about them, were a foundation\r\nfor greater progress, and, with the eighteenth century, the second\r\nperiod in the history of paleontology began.”\r\n\r\n_Diluvial Period._—During the eighteenth century many more books on\r\nfossils were published in western Europe, and now the prevalent\r\nexplanation was that they were the remains of the Noachian deluge. For\r\nnearly a century theologians and laymen alike took this view, and some\r\nof the books have become famous on this account, but the diluvial views\r\nsensibly declined with the close of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe true nature of fossils had now been clearly determined. They were\r\nthe remains of plants and animals, deposited long before the deluge,\r\npart in fresh water and part in the sea. “Some indicated a mild climate,\r\nand some the tropics. That any of these were extinct species, was as yet\r\nonly suspected.” Yet before the close of the century there were men in\r\nEngland and France who pointed out that different formations had\r\ndifferent fossils and that some of them were extinct. These views then\r\nled to many fantastic theories as to how the earth was formed—dreams,\r\nmost of them have been called. Marsh says:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The dominant idea of the first sixteen centuries of the present era\r\n  was, that the universe was made for Man. This was the great obstacle\r\n  to the correct determination of the position of the earth in the\r\n  universe, and, later, of the age of the earth.... In a superstitious\r\n  age, when every natural event is referred to a supernatural cause,\r\n  science cannot live.... Scarcely less fatal to the growth of science\r\n  is the age of Authority, as the past proves too well. With freedom of\r\n  thought, came definite knowledge, and certain progress;—but two\r\n  thousand years was long to wait.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant publications of this period was Linnæus’s\r\nSystema Naturæ, which appeared in 1735. In this work was introduced\r\nbinomial nomenclature, or the system of giving each plant and animal\r\nspecies a generic and specific name, as _Felis leo_ for the lion. The\r\nsystem was, however, not established until the tenth edition of the work\r\nin 1758, which became the starting point of zoological nomenclature.\r\nSince then there has been added another canon, the law of priority,\r\nwhich holds that the first name applied to a given form shall stand\r\nagainst all later names given to the same organism.\r\n\r\n_Catastrophic Period._—With the beginning of the nineteenth century\r\nthere started a new era in paleontology, and this was the time when the\r\nfoundations of the science were laid. The period continued for six\r\ndecades, or until the time of the Origin of Species. Marsh says that now\r\n“method replaced disorder, and systematic study superseded casual\r\nobservation.” Fossils were accurately determined, comparisons were made\r\nwith living forms, and the species named according to the binomial\r\nsystem. However, every species, recent and extinct, was regarded as a\r\nseparate creation, and because of the usually sharp separation of the\r\nsuperposed fossil faunas and floras, these were held to have been\r\ndestroyed through a series of periodic catastrophes of which the\r\nNoachian deluge was the last.\r\n\r\nLamarck between 1802 and 1806 described the Tertiary shells of the Paris\r\nbasin. Comparing them with the living forms, he saw that most of the\r\nfossils were of extinct species, and in this way he came to be the\r\nfounder of modern invertebrate paleontology. He also maintained after\r\n1801 that life has been continuous since its origin and that nature has\r\nbeen uniform in the course of its development. Marsh adds:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “His researches on the invertebrate fossils of the Paris Basin,\r\n  although less striking, were not less important than those of Cuvier\r\n  on the vertebrates; while the conclusions he derived from them form\r\n  the basis of modern biology.”\r\n\r\n  “Lamarck was the prophetic genius, half a century in advance of his\r\n  time.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCuvier established comparative anatomy and vertebrate paleontology, and\r\nwas one of the first to point out that fossil animals are nearly all\r\nextinct forms. He came to the latter conclusion in 1796 through a study\r\nof fossil elephants found in Europe. “Cuvier enriched the animal kingdom\r\nby the introduction of fossil forms among the living, bringing all\r\ntogether into one comprehensive system.” This opened to him entirely new\r\nviews respecting the theory of the earth, and he devoted more than\r\ntwenty-five years to developing the theories of special creation and\r\ncatastrophism, described in his Discourse on the Revolutions of the\r\nSurface of the Globe. “With all his knowledge of the earth, he could not\r\nfree himself from tradition, and believed in the universality and power\r\nof the Mosaic deluge. Again, he refused to admit the evidence brought\r\nforward by his distinguished colleagues against the permanence of\r\nspecies, and used all his great influence to crush out the doctrine of\r\nevolution, then first proposed” (Marsh).\r\n\r\nIn England it was William Smith (1769–1839) who independently discovered\r\nthe chronogenetic significance of fossils, and in their stratigraphic\r\nsuperposition indicated the way for the study of historical geology. He\r\nfirst published on this matter in 1799, but his completed statements\r\ncame in works entitled “Strata identified by Organized Fossils,”\r\n1816–1820, and “Stratigraphical System of Organized Fossils,” 1817.\r\n\r\nInvertebrate paleontology in America during the Catastrophic period had\r\nits beginning in Lesueur, who in 1818 described the Ordovician gastropod\r\n_Maclurites magna_. All of the paleontologists of this time were\r\nsatisfied to describe species and genera and to ascertain in a broad way\r\nthe stratigraphic significance of the fossil faunas and floras. James\r\nHall in 1854 (=17=, 312) knew of 1588 species, described and\r\nundescribed, in the New York system, while in England Morris listed in\r\nthat year 8300 Paleozoic forms. In 1856 Dana recites the known fossil\r\nspecies as follows (=22=, 333): The whole number of known American\r\nspecies of animals of the Permian to Recent is about 2000; while in\r\nBritain and Europe, there were over 20,000 species. In the Permian we\r\nhave none, while Europe has over 200 species. In the Triassic we have\r\nnone, Europe 1000 species; Jurassic 60, Europe over 4000; Cretaceous 350\r\nto 400, Europe about 6000; Tertiary hardly 1500, Europe about 8000.\r\nSince that time nearly all of the larger American Paleozoic faunas have\r\nbeen developed, but there are thousands of species yet to be described.\r\nWho the more prominent American paleontologists of this period were has\r\nbeen told in the section on the development of the geological column.\r\n\r\nThe grander paleontologic results of the Catastrophic period have been\r\nso well stated by Marsh that it is worth our while to repeat them here:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “It had now been proved beyond question that portions at least of the\r\n  earth’s surface had been covered many times by the sea, with\r\n  alternations of fresh water and of land; that the strata thus\r\n  deposited were formed in succession, the lowest of the series being\r\n  the oldest; that a distinct succession of animals and plants had\r\n  inhabited the earth during the different geological periods; and that\r\n  the order of succession found in one part of the earth was essentially\r\n  the same in all. More than 30,000 new species of extinct animals and\r\n  plants had now been described. It had been found, too, that from the\r\n  oldest formations to the most recent, there had been an advance in the\r\n  grade of life, both animal and vegetable, the oldest forms being among\r\n  the simplest, and the higher forms successively making their\r\n  appearance.\r\n\r\n  It had now become clearly evident, moreover, that the fossils from the\r\n  older formations were all extinct species, and that only in the most\r\n  recent deposits were there remains of forms still living.... Another\r\n  important conclusion reached, mainly through the labors of Lyell, was,\r\n  that the earth had not been subjected in the past to sudden and\r\n  violent revolutions; but the great changes wrought had been gradual,\r\n  differing in no essential respect from those still in progress.\r\n  Strangely enough, the corollary to this proposition, that life, too,\r\n  had been continuous on the earth, formed at that date no part of the\r\n  common stock of knowledge. In the physical world, the great law of\r\n  ‘correlation of forces’ had been announced, and widely accepted; but\r\n  in the organic world, the dogma of the miraculous creation of each\r\n  separate species still held sway.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Evolutionary Period._—This period begins with 1860 and the publication\r\nof Darwin’s Origin of Species (late in 1859). It is the period of modern\r\npaleontology, and is dominated by the belief that universal laws pervade\r\nnot only inorganic matter, but all life as well. Louis Agassiz had been\r\nin America fourteen years when Darwin’s book appeared, and his wonderful\r\ninfluence in bringing the zoology of our country to a high stand and the\r\nfurther influence he exerted through his students was bound to react\r\nbeneficially on invertebrate paleontology. Shortly after the beginning\r\nof this period, or in 1867, Alpheus Hyatt, one of Agassiz’s students,\r\nbegan to apply the study of embryology to fossil cephalopods, showing\r\nclearly that these shells retain a great deal of their growth stages or\r\nontogeny. This method of study was then followed by R. T. Jackson, C. E.\r\nBeecher, and J. P. Smith, and has been productive of natural\r\nclassifications of the Cephalopoda, Brachiopoda, Trilobita, and\r\nEchinoidea.\r\n\r\nThe dominant invertebrate paleontologist of this period was of course\r\nJames Hall, who described about 5000 species of American Paleozoic\r\nfossils. He also built up the New York State Museum, while around his\r\nprivate collections of fossils have been developed the American Museum\r\nof Natural History in New York City and the Walker Museum at the\r\nUniversity of Chicago. In his most important laboratory of paleontology\r\nat Albany, there have been trained either wholly or in part the\r\nfollowing paleontologists: F. B. Meek, C. A. White, R. P. Whitfield, C.\r\nD. Walcott, C. E. Beecher, John M. Clarke, and Charles Schuchert.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, through the work of the Geological Survey of the Dominion,\r\ncame the paleontologists Elkanah Billings and, later on, J. F.\r\nWhiteaves. The “father of Canadian paleontology,” Sir William Dawson,\r\nwho developed independently, was active in all branches of the science\r\nand did much to unravel the geology of eastern Canada. No organism has\r\nbeen more discussed and more often rejected and accepted as a fossil\r\nthan his “dawn animal of Canada,” _Eozoon canadense_, first described in\r\n1865. His son, George M. Dawson, was one of the directors of the\r\nGeological Survey of Canada. Finally the extensive paleontology of the\r\nCambrian of Canada was worked out by another self-made paleontologist,\r\nG. F. Matthew.\r\n\r\n_Paleobotany._—American paleobotany was developed during this, the\r\nfourth period, through the state and national surveys, first in Leo\r\nLesquereux, a Swiss student induced by Agassiz to come to America, and\r\nin J. S. Newberry. The second generation of paleobotanists is\r\nrepresented by Lester F. Ward and W. N. Fontaine, and the third\r\ngeneration, the present workers, includes F. H. Knowlton, David White,\r\nArthur Hollick, and E. W. Berry. A new line of paleobotanical work, the\r\nhistology of woody but pseudomorphous remains, has been developed by G.\r\nR. Wieland.\r\n\r\nThe grander results of the study of paleontology during the evolutionary\r\nperiod may be summed up with the conclusions of Marsh:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “One of the main characteristics of this epoch is the belief that all\r\n  life, living and extinct, has been evolved from simple forms. Another\r\n  prominent feature is the accepted fact of the great antiquity of the\r\n  human race. These are quite sufficient to distinguish this period\r\n  sharply from those that preceded it.”\r\n\r\n  Charles Darwin’s work at once aroused attention, and brought about in\r\n  scientific thought a revolution which “has influenced paleontology as\r\n  extensively as any other department of science.... In the [previous\r\n  period] species were represented independently by parallel lines; in\r\n  the present period, they are indicated by dependent, branching lines.\r\n  The former was the analytic, the latter is the synthetic period.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Synthetic Period._—What is to be the next trend in paleontology?\r\nClearly it is to be the Synthetic period, one that Marsh in 1879\r\nindicated in these words: “But if we are permitted to continue in\r\nimagination the rapidly converging lines of research pursued to-day,\r\nthey seem to meet at the point where organic and inorganic nature become\r\none. That this point will yet be reached, I cannot doubt.”\r\n\r\nThis Synthetic period, foreshadowed also in Herbert Spencer’s Synthetic\r\nPhilosophy, has not yet arrived, but before long another great leader\r\nwill appear. We have the prophecy of his coming in such books as The\r\nFitness of the Environment, by Lawrence J. Henderson, 1913; The Origin\r\nand Nature of Life, by Benjamin Moore, 1913; The Organism as a Whole, by\r\nJacques Loeb, 1916; and The Origin and Evolution of Life, by Henry F.\r\nOsborn, 1917.\r\n\r\nIn all nature, inorganic and organic, there is continuity and\r\nconsistency, beauty and design. We are beginning to see that there are\r\neternal laws, ever interacting and resulting in progressive and\r\nregressive evolutions. The realization of these scientific revelations\r\nkindles in us a desire for more knowledge, and the grandest revelations\r\nare yet before us in the synthesis of the sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _Notes._\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  For more detail in regard to these tillites and the older ones see\r\n  Climates of Geologic Time, by Charles Schuchert, being Chapter XXI in\r\n  Huntington’s Climatic Factor as Illustrated in Arid America,\r\n  Publication No. 192 of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1914.\r\n  Also Arthur P.

GREGORY\r\n\r\n\r\n The essence of physiography is the belief that land forms represent\r\nmerely a stage in the orderly development of the earth’s surface\r\nfeatures; that the various dynamic agents perform their characteristic\r\nwork throughout all geologic time. The formulation of principle and\r\nprocesses of earth sculpture was, therefore, impossible on the\r\nhypothesis of a ready-made earth whose features were substantially\r\nunchangeable, except when modified by catastrophic processes. In 1821,\r\nJ. W. Wilson wrote in the Journal: “Is it not the best theory of the\r\nearth, that the Creator, in the beginning, at least at the general\r\ndeluge, formed it with all its present grand characteristic\r\nfeatures?”[4] If so, a search for causes is futile, and the study of the\r\nwork performed by streams and glaciers and wind is unprofitable. The\r\nbelief in the Deluge as the one great geological event in the history of\r\nthe earth has brought it about that the speculations of Aristotle,\r\nHerodotus, Strabo, and Ovid, and the illustrious Arab, Avicenna\r\n(980–1037), unchecked by appeal to facts but also unopposed by\r\npriesthood or popular prejudice, are nearer to the truth than the\r\nintolerant controversial writings of the intellectual leaders whose\r\ntouchstone was orthodoxy. A few thinkers of the sixteenth century\r\nrevolted against the interminable repetition of error, and Peter\r\nSeverinus (1571) advised his students: “Burn up your books ... buy\r\nyourselves stout shoes, get away to the mountains, search the valleys,\r\nthe deserts, the shores of the seas.... In this way and no other will\r\nyou arrive at a knowledge of things.” But the thoroughgoing\r\n“diluvialist” who believed that a million species of animals could\r\noccupy a 450–foot Ark, but not that pebbles weathered from rock or that\r\nrivers erode, had no use for his powers of observation.\r\n\r\nSporadic germs of a science of land forms scattered through the\r\nliterature of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries found an\r\nunfavorable environment and produced inconspicuous growths. Even their\r\nsponsors did little to cultivate them. Steno (1631–1687) mildly\r\nsuggested that surface sculpturing, particularly on a small scale, is\r\nlargely the work of running water, and Guettard (1715–1786), a truly\r\ngreat mind, grasped the fundamental principles of denudation and\r\nsuccessfully entombed his views as well as his reputation in scores of\r\nbooks and volumes of cumbrous diffuse writing.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century a sufficient body of\r\nprinciples had been established to justify the recognition of an earth\r\nscience, geology, and the 195 volumes of the Journal thus far published\r\ncarry a large part of the material which has won approval for the new\r\nscience and given prominence to American thought. From the pages in the\r\nJournal, the progress of geology may be illustrated by tracing the\r\nfluctuation in the development of fact and theory as relates to valleys\r\nand glacial features, the subjects to which this chapter is devoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _The Interpretation of Valleys._\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _The Pioneers._\r\n\r\nDesmarest (1725–1815) might be styled the father of physiography. By\r\nconcrete examples and sound induction he established (1774) the doctrine\r\nthat the valleys of central France are formed by the streams which\r\noccupy them. He also made the first attempt to trace the history of a\r\nlandscape through its successive stages on the basis of known causes.\r\nHis methods and reasoning are practically identical with those of Dutton\r\nworking in the ancient lavas of New Mexico; and Whitney’s description of\r\nthe Table Mountains of California might well have appeared in\r\nDesmarest’s memoirs.[5] The teachings of Desmarest were strengthened and\r\nexpanded by DeSaussure (1740–1799), the sponsor for the term, “Geology,”\r\n(1779) who saw in the intimate relation of Alpine streams and valleys\r\nthe evidence of erosion by running water (1786).\r\n\r\nThe work of these acknowledged leaders of geological thought attracted\r\nsingularly little attention on the Continent, and Lamarck’s volume on\r\ndenudation (Hydrogéologie), which appeared in 1802, although an\r\nimportant contribution, sank out of sight. But the seed of the French\r\nschool found fertile ground in Edinburgh, the center of the geological\r\nworld during the first quarter of the nineteenth century. Hutton’s\r\n“Theory of the Earth, with Proofs and Illustrations,” in which the\r\nguidance of DeSaussure and Desmarest is gratefully acknowledged,\r\nappeared in 1795. The original publication aroused only local interest,\r\nbut when placed in attractive form by Playfair’s “Illustrations of the\r\nHuttonian Theory” (1802), the problem of the origin and development of\r\nland forms assumed a commanding position in geological thought. Hutton\r\nwas peculiarly fortunate in his environment. He had the support and\r\nassistance of a group of able scientific colleagues as well as the\r\nbitter opposition of Jameson and of the defenders of orthodoxy. His\r\nviews were discussed in scientific publications and found their way to\r\nliterary and theological journals. Hutton’s conception of the processes\r\nof land sculpture—slow upheaving and slow degradation of mountains,\r\ndifferential weathering, and the carving of valleys by streams—has a\r\nvery modern aspect. Playfair’s book would scarcely be out of place in a\r\ntwentieth century class room. The following paragraphs are quoted from\r\nit:[6]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “... A river, of which the course is both serpentine and deeply\r\n  excavated in the rock, is among the phenomena, by which the slow waste\r\n  of the land, and also the cause of that waste, are most directly\r\n  pointed out.\r\n\r\n  The structure of the vallies among mountains, shews clearly to what\r\n  cause their existence is to be ascribed. Here we have first a large\r\n  valley, communicating directly with the plain, and winding between\r\n  high ridges of mountains, while the river in the bottom of it descends\r\n  over a surface, remarkable, in such a scene, for its uniform\r\n  declivity. Into this, open a multitude of transverse or secondary\r\n  vallies, intersecting the ridges on either side of the former, each\r\n  bringing a contribution to the main stream, proportioned to its\r\n  magnitude; and, except where a cataract now and then intervenes, all\r\n  having that nice adjustment in their levels, which is the more\r\n  wonderful, the greater the irregularity of the surface. These\r\n  secondary vallies have others of a smaller size opening into them;\r\n  and, among mountains of the first order, where all is laid out on the\r\n  greatest scale, these ramifications are continued to a fourth, and\r\n  even a fifth, each diminishing in size as it increases in elevation,\r\n  and as its supply of water is less. Through them all, this law is in\r\n  general observed, that where a higher valley joins a lower one, of the\r\n  two angles which it makes with the latter, that which is obtuse is\r\n  always on the descending side; ... what else but the water itself,\r\n  working its way through obstacles of unequal resistance, could have\r\n  opened or kept up a communication between the inequalities of an\r\n  irregular and alpine surface....\r\n\r\n   ... The probability of such a constitution [arrangement of valleys]\r\n  having arisen from another cause, is, to the probability of its having\r\n  arisen from the running of water, in such a proportion as unity bears\r\n  to a number infinitely great.\r\n\r\n   ... With Dr. Hutton, we shall be disposed to consider those great\r\n  chains of mountains, which traverse the surface of the globe, as cut\r\n  out of masses vastly greater, and more lofty than any thing that now\r\n  remains.\r\n\r\n  From this gradual change of lakes into rivers, it follows, that a lake\r\n  is but a temporary and accidental condition of a river, which is every\r\n  day approaching to its termination; and the truth of this is attested,\r\n  not only by the lakes that have existed, but also by those that\r\n  continue to exist.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Steps Backward._\r\n\r\nEven Hutton’s clear reasoning, firmly buttressed by concrete examples,\r\nwas insufficient to overcome the belief in ready-made or violently\r\nformed valleys and original corrugations and irregularities of mountain\r\nsurface. The pages of the Journal show that the principles laid down by\r\nPlayfair were too far in advance of the times to secure general\r\nacceptance. In the first volume of the Journal, the gorge of the French\r\nBroad River is assigned by Kain to “some dreadful commotion in nature\r\nwhich probably shook these mountains to their bases,”[7] and the gorge\r\nof the lower Connecticut is considered by Hitchcock (1824)[8] as a\r\nbreach which drained a series of lakes “not many centuries before the\r\nsettlement of this country.” The prevailing American and English view\r\nfor the first quarter of the nineteenth century is expressed in the\r\nreviews in this Journal, where the well-known conclusions of Conybeare\r\nand Phillips that streams are incompetent to excavate valleys are quoted\r\nwith approval and admiration is expressed for Buckland’s famous\r\n“Reliquiæ Diluvianæ,” a 300–page quarto volume devoted to proof of a\r\ndeluge. The professor at Yale, Silliman, and the professor at Oxford,\r\nBuckland, saw that an acceptance of Hutton’s views involved a\r\nrepudiation of the Biblical flood, and much space is devoted to\r\ncombating these “erroneous” and “unscientific” views. For example,\r\nBuckland says:[9]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “... The general belief is, that existing streams, avalanches and\r\n  lakes, bursting their barriers, are sufficient to account for all\r\n  their phenomena, and not a few geologists, especially those of the\r\n  Huttonian school, at whose head is Professor Playfair, have till\r\n  recently been of this opinion.... But it is now very clear to almost\r\n  every man, who impartially examines the facts in regard to existing\r\n  vallies, that the causes now in action, mentioned above, are\r\n  altogether inadequate to their production; nay, that such a\r\n  supposition would involve a physical impossibility. We do not believe\r\n  that one-thousandth part of our present vallies were excavated by the\r\n  power of existing streams.... In very many cases of large rivers, it\r\n  is found, that so far from having formed their own beds, they are\r\n  actually in a gradual manner filling them up.\r\n\r\n  Again; how happens it that the source of a river is frequently below\r\n  the head of a valley, if the river excavated that valley?\r\n\r\n  The most powerful argument, however, in our opinion, against the\r\n  supposition we are combating, is the phenomena of transverse and\r\n  longitudinal valleys; both of which could not possibly have been\r\n  formed by existing streams.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPhillips writes in 1829:[10] “The excavation of valleys can be ascribed\r\nto no other cause than a great flood of water which overtopped the\r\nhills, whose summits those vallies descend.”\r\n\r\nFaith in Noah’s flood as the dominant agent of erosion rapidly lost\r\nground through the teaching of Lyell after 1830, but the theory of\r\nsystematic development of landscapes by rivers gained little. In fact,\r\nScrope in 1830,[11] in showing that the entrenched meanders of the\r\nMoselle prove gradual progressive stream work, was in advance of his\r\nEnglish contemporary. Judged by contributions to the Journal, Lyell’s\r\nteaching served to standardize American opinion of earth sculpture\r\nsomewhat as follows: The ocean is the great valley maker, but rivers\r\nalso make them; the position of valleys is determined by original or\r\nrenewed surface inequalities or by faulting; exceptional\r\noccurrences—earthquakes, bursting of lakes, upheavals and\r\ndepressions—have played an important part. Hayes (1839)[12] thought that\r\nthe surface of New York was essentially an upraised sea-bottom modified\r\nby erosion of waves and ocean currents. Sedgwick (1838)[13] considered\r\nhigh-lying lake basins proof of valleys which were shaped under the sea.\r\nMany of the valleys in the Chilian Cordillera were thought by Darwin\r\n(1844) to have been the work of waves and tides, and water gaps are\r\nascribed to currents “bursting through the range at those points where\r\nthe strata have been least inclined and the height consequently is\r\nless.” Speaking of the magnificent stream-cut canyons of the Blue\r\nMountains of New South Wales, gorges which lead to narrow exits through\r\nmonoclines, Darwin says: “To attribute these hollows to alluvial action\r\nwould be preposterous.”[14]\r\n\r\nThe influence of structure in the formation of valleys is emphasized by\r\nmany contributors to the Journal. Hildreth in 1836, in a valuable\r\npaper,[15] which is perhaps the first detailed topographic description\r\nof drainage in folded strata, expresses the opinion that the West\r\nVirginia ridges and valleys antedated the streams and that water gaps\r\nthough cut by rivers involve pre-existing lakes. Geddes (1826)[16]\r\ndenied that Niagara River cut its channel and speaks of valleys which\r\n“were valleys e’er moving spirit bade the waters flow.” Conrad\r\n(1839)[17] discussed the structural control of the Mohawk, the Ohio, and\r\nthe Mississippi, and Lieutenant Warren (1859)[18] concluded that the\r\nNiobrara must have originated in a fissure. According to Lesley\r\n(1862)[19] the course of the New River across the Great Valley and into\r\nthe Appalachians “striking the escarpment in the face” is determined by\r\nthe junction of anticlinal structures on the north with faulted\r\nmonoclines toward the south; a conclusion in harmony with the views of\r\nEdward Hitchcock (1841)[17] that major valleys and mountain passes are\r\nstructural in origin and that even subordinate folds and faults may\r\ndetermine minor features. “Is not this a beautiful example of\r\nprospective benevolence on the part of the Deity, thus, by means of a\r\nviolent fracture of primary mountains, to provide for easy\r\nintercommunication through alpine regions, countless ages afterwards!”\r\nThe extent of the wandering from the guidance of DeSaussure and Playfair\r\nafter the lapse of 50 years is shown by students of Switzerland. Alpine\r\nvalleys to Murchison (1851) were bays of an ancient sea; Schlaginweit\r\n(1852) found regional and local complicated crustal movements a\r\nsatisfactory cause, and Forbes (1863) saw only glaciers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Valleys Formed by Rivers._\r\n\r\nOne strong voice before 1860 appears to have called Americans back to\r\ntruths expounded by Desmarest and Hutton. Dana in 1850[20] amply\r\ndemonstrated that valleys on the Pacific Islands owe neither their\r\norigin, position or form to the sea or to structural factors. They are\r\nthe work of existing streams which have eaten their way headwards. Even\r\nthe valleys of Australia cited by Darwin as type examples of ocean work\r\nare shown to be products of normal stream work. Dana went further and\r\ngave a permanent place to the Huttonian idea that many bays, inlets, and\r\nfiords are but the drowned mouths of stream-made valleys. In the same\r\nvolume in which these conclusions appeared, Hubbard (1850)[21] announced\r\nthat in New Hampshire the “deepest valleys are but valleys of erosion.”\r\nThe theory that valleys are excavated by streams which occupy them was\r\nall but universally accepted after F. V. Hayden’s description[22] of\r\nRocky Mountain gorges (1862) and Newberry’s interpretation of the\r\ncanyons of Arizona (1862); but the scientific world was poorly prepared\r\nfor Newberry’s statement:[23]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Like the great canons of the Colorado, the broad valleys bounded by\r\n  high and perpendicular walls _belong to a vast system of erosion, and\r\n  are wholly due to the action of water_.... The first and most\r\n  plausible explanation of the striking surface features of this region\r\n  will be to refer them to that embodiment of resistless power—the sword\r\n  that cuts so many geological knots—volcanic force. The Great Canon of\r\n  the Colorado would be considered a vast fissure or rent in the earth’s\r\n  crust, and the abrupt termination of the steps of the table lands as\r\n  marking lines of displacement. This theory though so plausible, and so\r\n  entirely adequate to explain all the striking phenomena, lacks a\r\n  single requisite to acceptance, and that is _truth_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWith such stupendous examples in mind, the dictum of Hutton seemed\r\nreasonable: “there is no spot on which rivers may not formerly have\r\nrun.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Denudation by Rivers._\r\n\r\nThe general recognition of the competency of streams to form valleys was\r\na necessary prelude to the broader view expressed by Jukes (1862)[24]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The surfaces of our present lands are as much carved and sculptured\r\n  surfaces as the medallion carved from the slab, or the statue\r\n  sculptured from the block. They have been gradually reached by the\r\n  removal of the rock that once covered them, and are themselves but of\r\n  transient duration, always slowly wasting from decay.”\r\n\r\n\r\nContributions to the Journal between 1850 and 1870 reveal a tendency to\r\naccept greater degrees of erosion by rivers, but the necessary\r\nend-product of subaërial erosion—a plain—is first clearly defined by\r\nPowell in 1875.[25] In formulating his ideas Powell introduced the term\r\n“base-level,” which may be called the germ word out of which has grown\r\nthe “cycle of erosion,” the master key of modern physiographers. The\r\noriginal definition of base-level follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “We may consider the level of the sea to be a grand base-level, below\r\n  which the dry lands cannot be eroded; but we may also have, for local\r\n  and temporary purposes, other base-levels of erosion, which are the\r\n  levels of the beds of the principal streams which carry away the\r\n  products of erosion. (I take some liberty in using the term ‘level’ in\r\n  this connection, as the action of a running stream in wearing its\r\n  channel ceases, for all practical purposes, before its bed has quite\r\n  reached the level of the lower end of the stream. What I have called\r\n  the base-level would, in fact, be an imaginary surface, inclining\r\n  slightly in all its parts toward the lower end of the principal stream\r\n  draining the area through which the level is supposed to extend, or\r\n  having the inclination of its parts varied in direction as determined\r\n  by tributary streams.)”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis of Powell’s view has given definiteness to the distinction\r\nbetween “base-level,” an imaginary plane, and “a nearly featureless\r\nplain,” the actual land surface produced in the last stage of subaërial\r\nerosion.\r\n\r\nFollowing their discovery in the Colorado Plateau Province, denudation\r\nsurfaces were recognized on the Atlantic slope and discussed by McGee\r\n(1888),[26] in a paper notable for the demonstration of the use of\r\nphysiographic methods and criteria in the solution of stratigraphic\r\nproblems. Davis (1889)[27] described the upland of southern New England\r\ndeveloped during Cretaceous time, introducing the term “peneplain,” “a\r\nnearly featureless plain.” The short-lived opposition to the theory of\r\npeneplanation indicates that in America at least the idea needed only\r\nformulation to insure acceptance.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that surfaces now classed as peneplains were\r\nfully described by Percival (1842),[28] who assigned them to structure,\r\nand by Kerr (1880),[29] who considered glaciers the agent. In Europe\r\n“plains of denudation” have been clearly recognized by Ramsay (1846),\r\nJukes (1862), A. Geikie (1865), Foster and Topley (1865), Maw (1866),\r\nWynne (1867), Whitaker (1867), Macintosh (1869), Green (1882),\r\nRichthofen (1882), but all of them were looked upon as products of\r\nmarine work, and writers of more recent date in England seem reluctant\r\nto give a subordinate place to the erosive power of waves. Americans, on\r\nthe other hand, have been thinking in terms of rivers, and the great\r\ncontribution of the American school is not that peneplains exist, but\r\nthat they are the result of normal subaërial erosion. More precise field\r\nmethods during the past decade have revealed the fact that no one agent\r\nis responsible for the land forms classed as peneplains; that not only\r\nrivers and ocean, but ice, wind, structure, and topographic position\r\nmust be taken into account.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of rivers as valley-makers and of the final result of\r\nstream work necessarily preceded an analysis of the process of subaërial\r\nerosion. The first and last terms were known, the intermediate terms and\r\nthe sequence remained to be established. A significant contribution to\r\nthis problem was made by Jukes (1862).[34]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “... I believe that the lateral valleys are those which were first\r\n  formed by the drainage running directly from the crests of the chains,\r\n  the longitudinal ones being subsequently elaborated along the strike\r\n  of the softer or more erodable beds exposed on the flanks of those\r\n  chains.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPowell’s discussion of antecedent and consequent drainage (1875) and\r\nGilbert’s chapter on land sculpture in the Henry Mountain report (1880)\r\nare classics, and McGee’s contribution[30] contains significant\r\nsuggestions, but the master papers are by Davis,[31] who introduces an\r\nanalysis of land forms based on structure and age by the statement:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Being fully persuaded of the gradual and systematic evolution of\r\n  topographical forms it is now desired ... to seek the causes of the\r\n  location of streams in their present courses; to go back if possible\r\n  to the early date when central Pennsylvania was first raised from the\r\n  sea, and trace the development of the several river systems then\r\n  implanted upon it from their ancient beginning to the present time.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThat such a task could have been undertaken a quarter of a century ago\r\nand to-day considered a part of everyday field work shows how completely\r\nthe lost ground of a half century has been regained and how rapid the\r\nadvance in the knowledge of land sculpture since the canyons of the\r\nColorado Plateau were interpreted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Features Resulting from Glaciation._\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _The Problem Stated._\r\n\r\nEarly in the nineteenth century when speculation regarding the interior\r\nof the earth gave place in part to observations of the surface of the\r\nearth, geologists were confronted with perhaps the most difficult\r\nproblem in the history of the science. As stated by the editor of the\r\nJournal in 1821:[32]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The almost universal existence of rolled pebbles, and boulders of\r\n  rock, not only on the margin of the oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers;\r\n  but their existence, often in enormous quantities, in situations quite\r\n  removed from large waters; inland,—in high banks, embedded in strata,\r\n  or scattered, occasionally, in profusion, on the face of almost every\r\n  region, and sometimes on the tops and declivities of mountains, as\r\n  well as in the vallies between them; their entire difference, in many\r\n  cases, from the rocks in the country where they lie—rounded masses and\r\n  pebbles of primitive rocks being deposited in secondary and alluvial\r\n  regions, and vice versa; these and a multitude of similar facts have\r\n  ever struck us as being among the most interesting of geological\r\n  occurrences, and as being very inadequately accounted for by existing\r\n  theories.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phenomena demanding explanation—jumbled masses of “diluvium,”\r\npolished and striated rock, bowlders distributed with apparent disregard\r\nof topography—were indeed startling. Even Lyell, the great exponent of\r\nuniformitarianism, appears to have lost faith in his theories when\r\nconfronted with facts for which known causes seemed inadequate. The\r\ninterest aroused is attested by 31 titles in the Journal during its\r\nfirst two decades, articles which include speculations unsupported by\r\nlogic or fact, field observation unaccompanied by explanation, field\r\nobservation with fantastic explanation, _ex-cathedra_ pronouncements by\r\nprominent men, sound reasoning from insufficient data, and unclouded\r\nrecognition of cause and effect by both obscure and prominent men. With\r\nlittle knowledge of glaciers, areal geology, or of structure and\r\ncomposition of drift, all known forces were called in: normal\r\nweathering, catastrophic floods, ocean currents, waves, icebergs,\r\nglaciers, wind, and even depositions from a primordial atmosphere\r\n(Chabier, 1823). Human agencies were not discarded. Speaking of a\r\ngranite bowlder at North Salem, New York, described by Cornelius\r\n(1820)[33] as resting on limestone, Finch (1824)[34] says: “it is a\r\nmagnificent cromlech and the most ancient and venerable monument which\r\nAmerica possesses.” In the absence of a known cause, catastrophic\r\nagencies seem reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _The Deluge._\r\n\r\nIn the seventh volume of the Journal (1824)[35] we read:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “After the production of these regular strata of sand, clay,\r\n  limestone, &c. came a terrible irruption of water from the north, or\r\n  northwest, which in many places covered the preceding formations with\r\n  diluvial gravel, and carried along with it those immense masses of\r\n  granite, and the older rocks, which attest to the present day the\r\n  destruction and ruin of a former world.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother author remarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “We find a mantle as it were of sand and gravel indifferently covering\r\n  all the solid strata, and evidently derived from some convulsion which\r\n  has lacerated and partly broken up those strata....”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe catastrophe favored by most geologists was floods of water violently\r\nreleased—“we believe,” says the editor, “that all geologists agree in\r\nimputing ... the diluvium to the agency of a deluge at one period or\r\nanother.”[36] Such conclusions rested in no small way upon Hayden’s\r\nwell-known treatise on surficial deposits (1821),[37] a volume which\r\ndeserves a prominent place in American geological literature. Hayden\r\nclearly distinguished the topographic and structural features of the\r\ndrift but found an adequate cause in general wide-spread currents which\r\n“flowed impetuously across the whole continent ... from north east to\r\nsouth west.” In reviewing Hayden’s book Silliman remarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The general cause of these currents Mr. Hayden concludes to be the\r\n  deluge of Noah. While no one will object to the propriety of ascribing\r\n  very many, probably most of our alluvial features, to that\r\n  catastrophe, we conceive that neither Mr. Hayden, nor any other man,\r\n  is bound to prove the immediate physical cause of that vindictive\r\n  infliction.\r\n\r\n  We would beg leave to suggest the following as a cause which _may_\r\n  have aided in deluging the earth, and which, were there occasion,\r\n  _might_ do it again.\r\n\r\n  The existence of enormous caverns in the bowels of the earth, (so\r\n  often imagined by authors,) appears to be no very extravagant\r\n  assumption. It is true it cannot be proved, but in a sphere of eight\r\n  thousand miles in diameter, it would appear in no way extraordinary,\r\n  that many cavities might exist, which collectively, or even singly,\r\n  might well contain much more than all our oceans, seas, and other\r\n  superficial waters, none of which are probably more than a few miles\r\n  in depth. If these cavities communicate in any manner with the oceans,\r\n  and are (as if they exist at all, they probably are,) filled with\r\n  water, there exist, we conceive, agents very competent to expel the\r\n  water of these cavities, and thus to deluge, at any time, the dry\r\n  land.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe teachings of Hayden were favorably received by Hitchcock, Struder,\r\nand Hubbard, and many Europeans. They found a champion in Jackson, who\r\nstates (1839):[38]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “From the observations made upon Mount Ktaadn, it is proved, that the\r\n  current did rush over the summit of that lofty mountain, and\r\n  consequently the diluvial waters rose to the height of more than 5,000\r\n  feet. Hence we are enabled to prove, that the ancient ocean, which\r\n  rushed over the surface of the State, was at least a mile in depth,\r\n  and its transporting power must have been greatly increased by its\r\n  enormous pressure.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGibson, a student of western geology, reaches the same conclusion\r\n(1836):[39]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “That a wide-spread current, although not, as imagined, fed from an\r\n  inland sea, once swept over the entire region between the Alleghany\r\n  and the Rocky Mountains is established by plenary proof.”\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Sedgwick (1831) thought the sudden upheaval of mountains\r\nsufficient to have caused floods again and again. The strength of the\r\nbelief in the Biblical flood, during the first quarter of the 19th\r\ncentury, may be represented by the following remarks of Phillips\r\n(1832):[40]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Of many important facts which come under the consideration of\r\n  geologists, the ‘Deluge’ is, perhaps, the most remarkable; and it is\r\n  established by such clear and positive arguments, that if any one\r\n  point of natural history may be considered as proved, the deluge must\r\n  be admitted to have happened, because it has left full evidence in\r\n  plain and characteristic effects _upon the surface of the earth_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, the theory of deluges, whether of ocean or land streams, did\r\nnot hold the field unopposed. In 1823, Granger,[41] an observer whose\r\ncontributions to science total only six pages, speaks of the striæ on\r\nthe shore of Lake Erie as\r\n\r\n\r\n  “having been formed by the powerful and continued attrition of some\r\n  hard body.... To me, it does not seem possible that water under any\r\n  circumstances, could have effected it. The flutings in width, depth,\r\n  and direction, are as regular as if they had been cut out by a\r\n  grooving plane. This, running water could not effect, nor could its\r\n  operation have produced that glassy smoothness, which, in many parts,\r\n  it still retains.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHayes and also Conrad expressed similar views in the Journal 16 years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThe idea that ice was in some way concerned with the transportation of\r\ndrift has had a curious history. The first unequivocal statement, based\r\non reading and keen observation, was made in the Journal by Dobson in\r\n1826:[42]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “I have had occasion to dig up a great number of bowlders, of red\r\n  sandstone, and of the conglomerate kind, in erecting a cotton\r\n  manufactory; and it was not uncommon to find them worn smooth on the\r\n  under side, as if done by their having been dragged over rocks and\r\n  gravelly earth, in one steady position. On examination, they exhibit\r\n  scratches and furrows on the abraded part; and if among the minerals\r\n  composing the rock, there happened to be pebbles of feldspar, or\r\n  quartz, (which was not uncommon,) they usually appeared not to be worn\r\n  so much as the rest of the stone, preserving their more tender parts\r\n  in a ridge, extending some inches. When several of these pebbles\r\n  happen to be in one block, the preserved ridges were on the same side\r\n  of the pebbles, so that it is easy to determine which part of the\r\n  stone moved forward, in the act of wearing.\r\n\r\n  These bowlders are found, not only on the surface, but I have\r\n  discovered them a number of feet deep, in the earth, in the hard\r\n  compound of clay, sand, and gravel....\r\n\r\n  I think we cannot account for these appearances, unless we call in the\r\n  aid of ice along with water, and that they have been worn by being\r\n  suspended and carried in ice, over rocks and earth, under water.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Dobson’s day the hypothesis of “gigantic floods,” “debacles,”\r\n“resistless world-wide currents,” was so firmly entrenched that the\r\nvoice of the observant layman found no hearers, and a letter from Dobson\r\nto Hitchcock written in 1837 and containing additional evidence and\r\nargument remained unpublished until Murchison, in 1842,[43] paid his\r\nrespects to the remarkable work of a remarkable man.[44]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “I take leave of the glacial theory in congratulating American science\r\n  in having possessed the original author of the best glacial theory,\r\n  though his name had escaped notice; and in recommending to you the\r\n  terse argument of Peter Dobson, a previous acquaintance with which\r\n  might have saved volumes of disputation on both sides of the\r\n  Atlantic.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Glaciers vs. Icebergs._\r\n\r\nThe glacial theory makes its way into geological literature with the\r\ndevelopment of Agassiz (1837) of the views of Venetz (1833) and\r\nCharpentier (1834), that the glaciers of the Alps once had greater\r\nextent. The bold assumption was made that the surface of Europe as far\r\nsouth as the shores of the Mediterranean and Caspian seas was covered by\r\nice during a period immediately preceding the present. The kernel of the\r\npresent glacial theory is readily recognizable in these early works, but\r\nit is wrapped in a strange husk: it was assumed that the Alps were\r\nraised by a great convulsion under the ice and that the erratics slid to\r\ntheir places over the newly made declivities. The publication of the\r\nfamous “Etudes sur les Glaciers” (1840), remarkable alike for its\r\nclarity, its sound inductions, and wealth of illustrations, brought the\r\nideas of Agassiz more into prominence and inaugurated a 30–years’ war\r\nwith the proponents of currents and icebergs. The outstanding objections\r\nto the theory were the requirement of a frigid climate and the demand\r\nfor glaciers of continental dimensions; very strong objections, indeed,\r\nfor the time when fossil evidence was not available, the great polar ice\r\nsheets were unexplored, and the distinction between till and waterlaid\r\ndrift had not been established.\r\n\r\nThe glacial theory was cordially adopted by Buckland (1841)[45] and in\r\npart by Lyell in England but viewed with suspicion by Sedgwick, Whewell,\r\nand Mantell. In America the response to the new idea was immediate.\r\nHitchcock (1841)[46] concludes an able discussion with the statement:\r\n“So remarkably does it solve most of the phenomena of diluvial action,\r\nthat I am constrained to believe its fundamental principles to be\r\nfounded in truth.”\r\n\r\nThe theory formed the chief topic of discussion at the third and fourth\r\nmeetings of the Association of American Geologists and Naturalists\r\n(1842, 1843) under the lead of a committee on drift consisting of\r\nEmmons, W. B. Rogers, Vanuxem, Nicollet, Jackson, and J. L. Hayes. The\r\nresult of these discussions was a curious reaction. Hitchcock complained\r\nthat he “had been supposed to be an advocate for the unmodified glacial\r\ntheory, but he had never been a believer in it,” and Jackson spoke for a\r\nnumber of men when he stated:[47]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “This country exhibits no proofs of the glacial theory as taught by\r\n  Agassiz but on the contrary the general bearing of the facts is\r\n  against that theory.... Many eminent men incautiously embraced the new\r\n  theory, which within two or three years from its promulgation, had\r\n  been found utterly inadequate, and is now abandoned by many of its\r\n  former supporters.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOut of this symposium came also the strange contribution of H. D. Rogers\r\n(1844),[48] who cast aside the teachings of deduction and observation\r\nand returned to the views of the Medievalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “If we will conceive, then, a wide expanse of waters, less perhaps\r\n  than one thousand feet in depth, dislodged from some high northern or\r\n  circumpolar basin, by a general lifting of that region of perhaps a\r\n  few hundred feet, and an equal subsidence of the country south, and\r\n  imagine this whole mass converted by earthquake pulsations of the\r\n  breadth which such undulations have, into a series of stupendous and\r\n  rapid-moving waves of translation, helped on by the still more rapid\r\n  flexures of the floor over which they move, and then advert to the\r\n  shattering and loosening power of the tremendous jar of the\r\n  earthquake, we shall have an agent adequate in every way to produce\r\n  the results we see, to float the northern ice from its moorings, to\r\n  rip off, assisted with its aid, the outcrops of the hardest strata, to\r\n  grind up and strew wide their fragments, to scour down the whole rocky\r\n  floor, and, gathering energy with resistance, to sweep up the slopes\r\n  and over the highest mountains.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of the prominence of their author, Rogers’s views exerted some\r\ninfluence and seemingly received support from England through the\r\nelaborate mathematic discussions of Whewell (1848), who considered the\r\ndrift as “irresistible proof of paroxysmal action,” and Hopkins (1852),\r\nwho contended for “currents produced by repeated elevatory movements.”\r\n\r\nAfter his arrival in America (1846), Agassiz’s influence was felt, and\r\nhis paper on the erratic phenomena about Lake Superior (1850),[49] in\r\nwhich he called upon the advocates of water-borne ice to point out the\r\nbarrier which caused the current to subside, produced a salutary effect;\r\nyet Desor (1852)[50] states that in the region described by Agassiz “the\r\nassumption [of a general ice cap] is no longer admissible,” and that the\r\nbowlders on Long Island “were transported on ice rafts along the sea\r\nshore and stranded on the ridges and eminences which were then shoals\r\nalong the coast.” Twenty years of discussion were insufficient to\r\nestablish the glacial theory either in Europe or America. The consensus\r\nof opinion among the more advanced thinkers in 1860 is expressed by\r\nDana:[51]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “In view of the whole subject, it appears reasonable to conclude that\r\n  the Glacier theory affords the best and fullest explanation of the\r\n  phenomena over the general surface of the continents, and encounters\r\n  the fewest difficulties. But icebergs have aided beyond doubt in\r\n  producing the results along the borders of the continents, across\r\n  ocean-channels like the German Ocean and the Baltic, and possibly over\r\n  great lakes like those of North America. Long Island Sound is so\r\n  narrow that a glacier may have stretched across it.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPapers in the Journal of 1860–70 show a prevailing belief in icebergs,\r\nbut the evidence for land ice was accumulating as the deposits became\r\nbetter known, and in 1871 field workers speak in unmistakable tones:[52]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “It is still a mooted question in American geology whether the events\r\n  of the Glacial era were due to _glaciers_ or _icebergs_.... American\r\n  geologists are still divided in opinion, and some of the most eminent\r\n  have pronounced in favor of icebergs.\r\n\r\n  Since, then, icebergs cannot pick up masses tons in weight from the\r\n  bottom of a sea, or give a general movement southward to the loose\r\n  material of the surface; neither can produce the abrasion observed\r\n  over the rocks under its various conditions; and inasmuch as all\r\n  direct evidence of the submergence of the land required for an iceberg\r\n  sea over New England fails, the conclusion appears inevitable that\r\n  icebergs had nothing to do with the drift of the New Haven region, in\r\n  the Connecticut valley; and, therefore, that the Glacial era in\r\n  central New England was a _Glacier_ era.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew (1871)[53] reached the same conclusion for the Lower Provinces\r\nof Canada. In spite of the increasing clarity of the evidence, the\r\nbattle for the glacial theory was not yet won. The remaining opponents\r\nthough few in number were distinguished in attainments. Dawson clung to\r\nthe outworn doctrine until his death in 1899.\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature of the history of glacial theories is the\r\ncalculation by Maclaren (1842)[54] that the amount of water abstracted\r\nfrom the seas to form the hypothetical ice sheet would lower the ocean\r\nlevel 350 feet—an early form of the glacial control hypothesis (see\r\nDaly[55]).\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Extent of Glacial Drift._\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the nineteenth century, it was recognized that the\r\n“drift,” whatever its origin, was not of world-wide extent. In America\r\nits characteristic features were found best developed north of latitude\r\n40 degrees; in Europe, the Alps, the Scottish Highlands, and Scandinavia\r\nwere recognized as type areas. The limits were unassigned, partly\r\nbecause the field had not been surveyed, but largely because criteria\r\nfor the recognition of drift had not been established. The well-known\r\nhillocks and ridges of “diluvium” and “alluvium” and “drift” of New\r\nJersey and Ohio, and the mounds of the Missouri Cotou elaborately\r\ndescribed by Catlin (1840)[56] bore little resemblance to the walls of\r\nunsorted rock which stand as moraines bordering Alpine glaciers. The\r\nOrange sand of Mississippi was included in the drift by Hilgard\r\n(1866),[57] and the gravels at Philadelphia by Hall (1876).[58] Stevens\r\n(1873)[59] described trains of glacial erratics at Richmond, Virginia,\r\nand William B. Rogers (1876)[60] accounts for certain deposits in the\r\nPotomac, James, and Roanoke rivers by the presence of Pleistocene ice\r\ntongues or swollen glacial rivers, and remarks: “It is highly probable\r\nthat glacial action had much to do with the original accumulation of the\r\nrocky debris on the flanks of the Blue Ridge, and in the Appalachian\r\nvalleys beyond.” Kerr (1881)[61] referred the ancient erosion surface of\r\nthe Piedmont belt in North Carolina to glacial denudation, De la Beche\r\ncompared the drift of Jamaica with that of New England, and Agassiz\r\ninterpreted soils of Brazil as glacial.\r\n\r\nThe first detailed description and unequivocal interpretation of either\r\nterminal or recessional moraines is from the pen of Gilbert (1871),[62]\r\ngeologist of the Ohio Survey. In discussing the former outlet of Lake\r\nErie through the Fort Wayne channel, Gilbert writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The page of history recorded in these phenomena is by no means\r\n  ambiguous. The ridges, or, more properly, the ridge which determines\r\n  the courses of the St. Joseph and St. Marys rivers is a buried\r\n  terminal moraine of the glacier that moved southwestward through the\r\n  Maumee valley. The overlying Erie Clay covers it from sight, but it is\r\n  shadowed forth on the surface of that deposit, as the ground is\r\n  pictured through a deep and even canopy of snow. Its irregularly\r\n  curved outline accords intimately with the configuration of the\r\n  valley, and with the direction of the ice markings; its concavity is\r\n  turned toward the source of motion; its greatest convexity is along\r\n  the line of least resistance.\r\n\r\n  South of the St. Marys river are other and numerous moraines\r\n  accompanied by glacial striæ. Their character and courses have not yet\r\n  been studied; but their presence carries the mind back to an epoch of\r\n  the cold period, when the margin of the icefield was farther south,\r\n  and the glacier of the Maumee valley was merged in the general mass.\r\n  As the mantle of ice grew shorter—and, in fact, at every stage of its\r\n  existence—its margin must have been variously notched and lobed in\r\n  conformity with the contour of the country, the higher lands being\r\n  first laid bare by the encroaching secular summer. Early in the\r\n  history of this encroachment the glacier of the Maumee valley\r\n  constituted one of these lobes, and has recorded its form in the two\r\n  moraines that I have described.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThree years after the recognition of moraines in the Maumee valley,\r\nChamberlin (1874)[63] showed that the seemingly disorganized mounds and\r\nbasins and ridges known as the Kettle range of Wisconsin is the terminal\r\nmoraine of the Green Bay glacier. At an earlier date (1864) Whittlesey\r\ninterpreted the kettles of the Wisconsin moraine as evidence of ice\r\nblocks from a melting glacier and presented a map showing the “southern\r\nlimit of boulders and coarse drift.” In 1876 attention was called to the\r\nterminal moraine of New England by G. Frederick Wright, who assigns the\r\nhonor of discovery to Clarence King.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: G K Gilbert]\r\n\r\nWith the observations of Gilbert, Chamberlin, and King in mind, the\r\nterminal moraine was traced by various workers across the United States\r\nand into Canada and the extent of glacial cover revealed. Following 1875\r\nthe pages of the Journal contain many contributions dealing with the\r\norigin and structure of moraines, eskers, kames, and drumlins. Before\r\n1890 twenty-eight papers on the glacial phenomena of the Erie and Ohio\r\nbasin alone had appeared. By 1900 substantial agreement had been reached\r\nregarding the significant features of the drift, the outline history of\r\nthe Great Lakes had been written, and the way had been paved for\r\nstratigraphic studies of the Pleistocene, which bulk large in the pages\r\nof the Journal for the last two decades.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Epochs of Glaciation._\r\n\r\nFor a decade following the general acceptance of the glacial origin of\r\n“diluvium,” the deposits were embraced as “drift” and treated as the\r\nproducts of one long period of glacial activity, and throughout the\r\ncontroversy of iceberg and glacier the unity of the glacial period was\r\nunquestioned. Beds of peat and fossiliferous lacustrine deposits in\r\nSwitzerland, England, and in America and the recognition of an “upper”\r\nand a “lower” diluvium by Scandinavian geologists suggested two epochs,\r\nand as the examples of such deposits increased in number and it became\r\nevident that the plant fossils represented forms demanding a genial\r\nclimate and that the phenomena were seen in many countries, the belief\r\ngrew that minor fluctuations or gradual recession of an ice sheet were\r\ninadequate to account for the phenomena observed.\r\n\r\nIt is natural that this problem should have found its solution in\r\nAmerica, where the Pleistocene is admirably displayed, and where the\r\nState and Federal surveys were actively engaged in areal mapping. In\r\n1883 Chamberlin[64] presented his views under the bold title,\r\n“Preliminary Paper on the Terminal Moraine of the Second Glacial Epoch,”\r\nand the existence of deposits of two or more ice sheets and the features\r\nof interglacial periods were substantially established by the\r\ninteresting debate in the Journal led by Chamberlin, Wright, Upham and\r\nDana.[65] Contributions since 1895 have been concerned with the degree\r\nrather than the fact of complexity, and continued study has resulted in\r\nthe general recognition of five glacial stages in North America and four\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _The Loess as a Glacial Deposit._\r\n\r\nA curious side-product of the study of glaciation in North America is\r\nthe controversy over the origin of loess. The interest aroused is\r\nindicated by scores of papers in American periodicals and State reports\r\nof the last quarter of the 19th century—papers which bear the names of\r\nprominent geologists.\r\n\r\nThe “loess” in the valley of the Rhine had long been known, but the\r\nsubject assumed prominence by the publication in 1866 of Pumpelly’s\r\nTravels in China.[66] Wide-spread deposits 200 to 1,000 feet thick were\r\ndescribed as very fine-grained yellowish earth of distinctive structure\r\nwithout stratification but penetrated by innumerable tubes and\r\ncontaining land or fresh-water shells. Pumpelly considered these\r\ndeposits lacustrine, a view which found general acceptance though\r\ncombated by Kingsmill (1871),[67] who argued for marine deposition.\r\nBaron Von Richthofen’s classic on China, which appeared in 1877,\r\namplifies the observations of Pumpelly and marshals the evidence to\r\nsupport the hypothesis that the loess is wind-laid both on dry land and\r\nwithin ancient salt lakes. The conclusions of Von Richthofen were\r\nadopted by Pumpelly whose knowledge of the Chinese deposits,\r\nsupplemented by studies in Missouri, of which State he was director of\r\nthe Geological Survey in 1872–73, placed him in position to form a\r\ncorrect judgment. He says:[68]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Recognizing from personal observation the full identity of character\r\n  of the loess of northern China, Europe and the Missouri Valley, I am\r\n  obliged to reject my own explanation of the origin of the Chinese\r\n  deposits, and to believe with Richthofen that the true loess, wherever\r\n  it occurs, is a sub-aerial deposit, formed in a dry central region,\r\n  and that it owes its structure to the formative influence of a steppe\r\n  vegetation.\r\n\r\n  The one weak point of Richthofen’s theory is in the evident inadequacy\r\n  of the current disintegration as a source of material. When we\r\n  consider the immense area covered by loess to depths varying from 50\r\n  to 2,000 feet, and the fact that this is only the very finest portion\r\n  of the product of rock-destruction, and again that the accumulation\r\n  represents only a very short period of time, geologically speaking,\r\n  surely we must seek a more fertile source of supply than is furnished\r\n  by the current decomposition of rock surface.\r\n\r\n  It seems to me that there are two important sources: I. The silt\r\n  brought by rivers, many of them fed by the products of glacial\r\n  attrition flowing from the mountains into the central region. Where\r\n  the streams sink away, or where the lakes which receive them have\r\n  dried up, the finer products of the erosion of a large territory are\r\n  left to be removed in dust storms.\r\n\r\n  II. The second ... source is the residuary products of a secular\r\n  disintegration.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evidence presented by Pumpelly for the eolian origin of\r\nloess—structure, texture, composition, fossil content and topographic\r\nposition—is complete, and to him belongs the credit for the correct\r\ninterpretation of the Mississippi valley deposits. Unfortunately his\r\ncontribution came at a time when the geologists of the central States\r\nwere intent on tracing the paths and explaining the work of Pleistocene\r\nglaciers, and the belief was strong that loess was some phase of glacial\r\nwork. Its position at the border of the Iowan drift so obviously\r\nsuggests a genetic relation that the fossil evidence of steppe climate\r\nsuggested by Binney in 1848[69] was minimized. Students of Pleistocene\r\ngeology in Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, although less vigorous\r\nin expression, were substantially in agreement with Hilgard (1879).[70]\r\n“The sum total of anomalous conditions required to sustain the eolian\r\nhypothesis partakes strongly of the marvellous.” The last edition of\r\nDana’s Manual, 1894, and of LeConte’s Geology, 1896, the two most widely\r\nused text-books of their time, oppose the eolian theory, and Chamberlin,\r\nin 1897,[71] states: “the aqueous hypothesis seems best supported so far\r\nas concerns the deposits of the Mississippi Valley and western Europe”\r\n(p. 795). Shimek, in papers published since 1896 has shown that aquatic\r\nand glacial conditions can not account for the loess fossils, and the\r\nreturn to the views of Pumpelly that the loess was deposited on land by\r\nthe agency of wind in a region of steppe vegetation is now all but\r\nuniversal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Glacial Sculpture._\r\n\r\nWithin the present generation sculpture by glaciers has received much\r\nattention and has involved a reconsideration of the ability of ice to\r\nerode which in turn involves a crystallization of views of the mechanics\r\nof moving ice. The evidence for glacier erosion has remained largely\r\nphysiographic and rests on a study of land forms. In fact, the\r\ninadequacy of structural features or of river corrasion to account for\r\nflat-floored, steep-walled gorges, hanging valleys, and many lake\r\nbasins, rather than a knowledge of the mechanics of ice has led to the\r\npresent fairly general belief that glaciers are powerful agents of rock\r\nsculpture. The details of the process are not yet understood.\r\n\r\nErosion by glaciers enters the arena of active discussion in 1862–63.\r\nThe possibility had been suggested by Esmark (1827) and by Dana (1849)\r\nin the description of fiords and by Hind (1855) with reference to the\r\norigin of the Great Lakes. It appears full-fledged in Ramsay’s classic,\r\nwhich was published simultaneously in England and in America.[72] The\r\nargument runs as follows: There is a close association of ancient\r\nglaciers and lakes especially in mountains; glaciers are amply able to\r\nerode; evidences of faulting, special subsidence, river erosion, and\r\nmarine erosion are absent from the lake basins of Switzerland and Great\r\nBritain. To quote Ramsay:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “It required a solid body grinding steadily and powerfully in direct\r\n  and heavy contact with and across the rocks to scoop out deep hollows,\r\n  the situations of which might either be determined by unequal hardness\r\n  of the rocks, by extra weight of ice in special places, or by\r\n  accidental circumstances, the clue to which is lost from our inability\r\n  perfectly to reconstruct the original forms of the glaciers.”\r\n\r\n  “I believe with the Italian geologists, that all that the glaciers as\r\n  a whole effected was only slightly to deepen these valleys and\r\n  materially to modify their general outlines, and, further (a theory I\r\n  am alone responsible for), to deepen them in parts more considerably\r\n  when, from various causes, the grinding power of the ice was unusually\r\n  powerful, especially where, as in the lowlands of Switzerland, the\r\n  Miocene strata are comparatively soft.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhittlesey (1864)[73] considered that the rock-bound lakes and narrow\r\nbays near Lake Superior were partly excavated by ice. LeConte (1875)[74]\r\nrecords some significant observations in a pioneer paper on glacier\r\nerosion which has not received adequate recognition. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “... I am convinced that a glacier, by its enormous pressure and\r\n  resistless onward movement, is _constantly breaking off large blocks_\r\n  from its bed and bounding walls. Its erosion is not only a grinding\r\n  and scoring, but also a _crushing and breaking_. It makes by its\r\n  erosion not only rock-meal, but also large _rock-chips_.... Its\r\n  erosion is a constant process of alternate _rough hewing_ and\r\n  _planing_.\r\n\r\n  If Yosemite were unique, we might suppose that it was formed by\r\n  violent cataclysms; but _Yosemite is not unique_ in _form_ and\r\n  therefore probably not in _origin_. There are many Yosemites. It is\r\n  more philosophical to account for them by the _regular_ operation of\r\n  known causes. I must believe that all these deep perpendicular slots\r\n  have been sawn out by the action of glaciers; the _peculiar\r\n  verticality of the walls having been determined by the perpendicular\r\n  cleavage structure_.”... A lake in Bloody Canyon “is a _pure rock\r\n  basin scooped out by the glacier_ at this place.... These ridges\r\n  [separating Hope, Faith, and Charity valleys] are in fact the lips of\r\n  consecutive lake basins scooped out by ice.\r\n\r\n  ... Water tends to form deep V-shaped canons, while ice produces broad\r\n  valleys with lakes and meadows.... I know not how general these\r\n  distinctions may be, but certainly the Coast range of this State is\r\n  characterized by rounded summits and ridges, and deep V-shaped canons,\r\n  while the high Sierras are characterized on the contrary by sharp,\r\n  spire-like, comb-like summits, and broad valleys; and this difference\r\n  I am convinced is due in part at least to the action of water on the\r\n  one hand, and of ice on the other.”\r\n\r\n\r\nKing (1878)[75] assigned to glacial erosion a commanding position in\r\nmountain sculpture. In regard to the Uintas, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Glacial erosion has cut almost vertically down through the beds\r\n  carving immense amphitheatres with basin bottoms containing numerous\r\n  Alpine lakes.... Post-glacial erosion has done an absolutely trivial\r\n  work. There is not a particle of direct evidence, so far as I can see,\r\n  to warrant the belief that these U-shaped canons were given their\r\n  peculiar form by other means than the actual ploughing erosion of\r\n  glaciers....”\r\n\r\n\r\nThese contributions from the Cordilleras corroborating the conclusions\r\nof Ramsay (1862), Tyndall (1862), Jukes (1862), Hector (1863), Logan\r\n(1863), Close (1870), and James Geikie (1875), made little impression.\r\nThe views of Lyell (1833), Ball (1863), J. W. Dawson (1864), Falconer\r\n(1864), Studer (1864), Murchison (1864, 1870), Ruskin (1865), Rutimeyer\r\n(1869), Whymper (1871), Bonney (1873), Pfaff (1874), Gurlt (1874), Judd\r\n(1876), prevailed, and the conclusions of Davis in 1882[76] fairly\r\nexpressed the prevailing belief in Europe and in America:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The amount of glacial erosion in the central districts has been very\r\n  considerable, but not greatly in excess of pre-glacial soils and old\r\n  talus and alluvial deposits. Most of the solid rock that was carried\r\n  away came from ledges rather than from valleys; and glaciers had in\r\n  general a smoothing rather than a roughening effect. In the outer\r\n  areas on which the ice advanced it only rubbed down the projecting\r\n  points; here it acted more frequently as a depositing than as an\r\n  eroding agent.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the past quarter-century the cleavage in the ranks of geologists,\r\nbrought about by Ramsay’s classic paper, has remained. Fairchild and\r\nothers in America, Heim, Bonney, and Garwood in Europe argue for\r\ninsignificant erosion by glaciers; and Gannet, Davis, Gilbert, Tarr in\r\nAmerica followed by Austrian workers present evidence for erosion on a\r\ngigantic scale. A perusal of the voluminous literature in the Journal\r\nand elsewhere shows that the difference of opinion is in part one of\r\nterms, the amount of erosion rather than the fact of erosion; it also\r\narises from failure to differentiate the work of mountain glaciers and\r\ncontinental ice sheets, of Pleistocene glaciers and their present\r\ndiminished representatives. The irrelevant contribution of physicists\r\nhas also made for confusion.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the criteria for erosion of valleys by\r\nglaciers has long been established and by workers in different\r\ncountries. Ramsay (1862) in England outlined the problem and presented\r\ngeneralized evidence. Hector (1863) in New Zealand pointed out the\r\nsignificance of discordant drainage, the “hanging valleys” of Gilbert.\r\nThe U-form, the broad lake-dotted floor, and the presence of cirques and\r\nthe process of plucking were probably first described by LeConte (1873)\r\nin America. The truncation of valley spurs by glaciers pointed out by\r\nStuder in the Kerguelen Islands (1878) was used by Chamberlin (1883) as\r\nevidence of glacial scouring.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Conclusion._\r\n\r\nDuring the past century many principles of land sculpture have emerged\r\nfrom the fog of intellectual speculation and unorganized observation and\r\ntaken their place among generally accepted truths. Many of them are no\r\nlonger subjects of controversy. Erosion has found its place as a major\r\ngeologic agent and has given a new conception of natural scenery. Lofty\r\nmountains are no longer “ancient as the sun,” they are youthful features\r\nin process of dissection; valleys and canyons are the work of streams\r\nand glaciers; fiords are erosion forms; waterfalls and lakes are\r\nfeatures in process of elimination; many plains and plateaus owe their\r\nform and position to long-continued denudation. Modern landscapes are no\r\nlonger viewed as original features or the product of a single agent\r\nacting at a particular time, but as ephemeral forms which owe their\r\npresent appearance to their age and the particular forces at work upon\r\nthem as well as to their original structure.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note the halting steps leading to the present\r\nviewpoint, to find that decades elapsed between the formulation of a\r\ntheory or the recording of significant facts and their final acceptance\r\nor rejection, and to realize that the organization of principles and\r\nobservations into a science of physiography has been the work of the\r\npresent generation. Progress has been conditioned by a number of factors\r\nbesides the intellectual ability of individual workers.\r\n\r\nThe influence of locality is plainly seen. Convincing evidence of river\r\nerosion was obtained in central France, the Pacific Islands, and the\r\nColorado Plateau—regions in which other causes were easily eliminated.\r\nSculpture by glaciers passed beyond the theoretical stage when the\r\nsimple forms of the Sierras and New Zealand Alps were described. The\r\norigin of loess was first discerned in a region where glacial phenomena\r\ndid not obscure the vision. The complexity of the Glacial period\r\nasserted by geologists of the Middle West was denied by eastern\r\nstudents. The work of waves on the English coast impressed British\r\ngeologists to such an extent that plains of denudation and inland\r\nvalleys were ascribed to ocean work.\r\n\r\nIn the establishment of principles, the friendly interchange of ideas\r\nhas yielded large returns. Many of the fundamental conceptions of earth\r\nsculpture have come from groups of men so situated as to facilitate\r\ncriticism. It is impossible, even if desirable, to award individual\r\ncredit to Venetz, Charpentier, and Agassiz in the formulation of the\r\nglacial theory; and the close association of Agassiz and Dana in New\r\nEngland and of Chamberlin and Irving in Wisconsin was undoubtedly\r\nhelpful in establishing the theory of continental glaciation. From the\r\nintimate companionship in field and laboratory of Hutton, Playfair and\r\nHope, arose the profound influence of the Edinburgh school, and the\r\nsympathetic cooperation of Powell, Gilbert, and Dutton has given to the\r\nworld its classics in the genetic study of land forms.\r\n\r\nThe influence of ideas has been closely associated with clarity,\r\nconciseness, and attractiveness of presentation. Hutton is known through\r\nPlayfair, Agassiz’s contributions to glacial geology are known to every\r\nstudent, while Venetz, Charpentier, and Hugi are only names. Cuvier’s\r\ndiscourses on dynamical geology were reprinted and translated into\r\nEnglish and German, but Lamarck’s “Hydrogéologie” is known only to book\r\ncollectors. The verbose works of Guettard, although carrying the same\r\nmessage as Playfair’s “Illustrations” and Desmarest’s “Memoirs,” are\r\npractically unknown, as is also Horace H. Hayden’s treatise (1821) on\r\nthe drift of eastern North America. It has been well said that the\r\nworld-wide influence of American physiographic teaching is due in no\r\nsmall part to the masterly presentations of Gilbert and Davis.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising to note the delays, the backward steps, and the\r\nduplication of effort resulting from lack of familiarity with the work\r\nof the pioneers. Sabine says in 1864:[77]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “It often happens, not unnaturally, that those who are most occupied\r\n  with the questions of the day in an advancing science retain but an\r\n  imperfect recollection of the obligations due to those who laid the\r\n  first foundations of our subsequent knowledge.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe product of intellectual effort appears to be conditioned by time of\r\nplanting and character of soil as well as by quantity of seed. For\r\nexample: Erosion by rivers was as clearly shown by Desmarest as by Dana\r\nand Newberry 50 years later. Criteria for the recognition of ancient\r\nfluviatile deposits were established by James Deane in 1847 in a study\r\nof the Connecticut Valley Triassic. Agassiz’s proof that ice is an\r\nessential factor in the formation of till is substantially a duplication\r\nof Dobson’s observations (1826).\r\n\r\nThe volumes of the Journal with their very large number of articles and\r\nreviews dealing with geology show that the interpretation of land forms\r\nas products of subaërial erosion began in France and French Switzerland\r\nduring the later part of the eighteenth century as a phase of the\r\nintellectual emancipation following the Revolution. Scotland and England\r\nassumed the leadership for the first half of the nineteenth century, and\r\nthe first 100 volumes of the Journal show the profound influence of\r\nEnglish and French teaching. In America, independent thinking, early\r\nexercised by the few, became general with the establishment of the\r\nFederal survey, the increase in university departments, geological\r\nsocieties and periodicals, and has given to Americans the\r\nresponsibilities of teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Bibliography._\r\n\r\n(In the following list “this Journal” refers to the American Journal of\r\nScience.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Wilson, J.

Geology was still subordinate to\r\nmineralogy, was hardly recognized as a distinct science, and consisted\r\nin little more than a description of the character and distribution of\r\nminerals and rocks. America was remote from the Old World centers of\r\nlearning. The energy of the young nation was absorbed in its own\r\nexpansion, and but a few of those who by aptitude were fitted to\r\nincrease scientific knowledge were even conscious of the existence of\r\nsuch a field of endeavor. Under these circumstances the educative field\r\nopen to a journal of science in the United States was an almost virgin\r\nsoil. Original contributions could most readily be based upon the\r\nnatural history of the New World, and the founder of the Journal showed\r\ninsight appreciative of the situation in stating in the “Plan of the\r\nWork” in the introduction to the first volume that “It will be a leading\r\nobject to illustrate AMERICAN NATURAL HISTORY, and especially our\r\nMINERALOGY and GEOLOGY.”\r\n\r\nAt this time educated people were still satisfied that the whole\r\nknowledge of the origin and development of the earth so far as man could\r\nor should know it was embraced in the Book of Genesis. They were\r\ninclined to look with misgiving at attempts to directly interrogate the\r\nearth as to its history. Philosophers such as Descartes and Liebnitz,\r\nthe cosmogonists de Maillet and Buffon had been less instrumental in\r\ndeveloping science than in fitting a few facts and many speculations to\r\ntheir systems of philosophy. By the opening of the nineteenth century,\r\nhowever, men of learning were coming to appreciate that the way to\r\nadvance science was to experiment and observe, to collect facts and\r\ndiscourage unfounded speculation. Silliman’s insight into the needs of\r\ngeologic science is shown in the following quotation (=1=, pp. 6, 7,\r\n1818):\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Our geology, also, presents a most interesting field of inquiry. A\r\n  grand outline has recently been drawn by Mr. Maclure, with a masterly\r\n  hand, and with a vast extent of personal observation and labour: but\r\n  to fill up the detail, both observation and labour still more\r\n  extensive are demanded; nor can the object be effected, till more good\r\n  geologists are formed, and distributed over our extensive territory.\r\n\r\n  To account for the formation and changes of our globe, by excursions\r\n  of the imagination, often splendid and imposing, but usually\r\n  visionary, and almost always baseless, was, till within half a\r\n  century, the business of geological speculations; but this research\r\n  has now assumed a more sober character; the science of geology has\r\n  been reared upon numerous and accurate observations of _facts_; and\r\n  standing thus upon the basis of induction, it is entitled to a rank\r\n  among those sciences which Lord Bacon’s Philosophy has contributed to\r\n  create. Geological researches are now prosecuted by actually exploring\r\n  the structure and arrangement of districts, countries, and continents.\r\n  The obliquity of the strata of most rocks, causing their edges to\r\n  project in many places above the surface; their exposure, in other\r\n  instances on the sides or tops of hills and mountains; or, in\r\n  consequence of the intersection of their strata, by roads, canals, and\r\n  river-courses, or by the wearing of the ocean; or their direct\r\n  perforation, by the shafts of mines; all these causes, and others,\r\n  afford extensive means of reading the interior structure of the globe.\r\n\r\n  The outlines of American geology appear to be particularly grand,\r\n  simple, and instructive; and a knowledge of the important facts, and\r\n  general principles of this science, is of vast practical use, as\r\n  regards the interests of agriculture, and the research for useful\r\n  minerals. Geological and mineralogical descriptions, and maps of\r\n  particular states and districts, are very much needed in the United\r\n  States; and to excite a spirit to furnish them will form one leading\r\n  object of this Journal.”\r\n\r\n\r\n              _The Prolonged Influence of Outgrown Ideas._\r\n\r\nThose interested in any branch of science should, as a matter of\r\neducation, read the history of that special subject. A knowledge of the\r\nstages by which the present development has been attained is essential\r\nto give a proper perspective to the literature of each period. Much of\r\nthe existing terminology is an inheritance from the first attempts at\r\nnomenclature, or may rest upon theories long discarded. Popular notions\r\nat variance with advanced teaching are often the forgotten inheritance\r\nof a past generation.\r\n\r\nGneiss, trap, and Old Red Sandstone are names which we owe to Werner.\r\nThe “Tertiary period” and “drift” are relics of an early terminology.\r\nThe geology of tourist circulars still speaks of canyons as made by\r\n“convulsions of nature.” Popular writers still attribute to geologists a\r\nbelief in a molten earth covered by a thin crust. Within the present\r\ncentury the eighteenth century speculations of Werner and his\r\npredecessors, postulating a supposed capacity of water to seep through\r\nthe crust into the interior of the earth, resulting in a hypothetical\r\nprogressive desiccation of the surface, views long abandoned by most\r\nmodern geologists, have been revived by an astronomer into a theory of\r\n“planetology.”\r\n\r\nA review of the literature of a century brings to light certain\r\ntendencies in the growth of science. Each decade has witnessed a larger\r\naccumulation of observed facts and a fuller classification of these\r\nfundamental data, but the pendulum of interpretative theory swings away\r\nfrom the path of progress, now to one side, now to the other, testing\r\nout the proper direction. For decades the understanding of certain\r\nclasses of facts may be actually retrogressive. A retrospect shows that\r\ncertain minds, keen and unfettered by a prevailing theory, have in some\r\ndirections been in advance of their generation. But the judgment of the\r\ntimes had not sufficient basis in knowledge for the separation and\r\nacceptance of their truer views from the contemporaneous tangle of false\r\ninterpretations.\r\n\r\nAn interesting illustration of these statements regarding the slow\r\nsettling of opinion may be cited in regard to the significance of the\r\ndip of the Triassic formations of the eastern United States. The strata\r\nof the Massachusetts-Connecticut basin possess a monoclinal easterly dip\r\nwhich averages about 20 degrees to the east. Those of the New\r\nJersey-Pennsylvania-Virginia basin possess a similar dip to the\r\nnorthwest. Both basins are cut by great faults and the dip is now\r\naccepted by practically all geologists as due to rotation of the crust\r\nblocks away from a geanticlinal axis between the two basins. Edward\r\nHitchcock, whose work from the first shows an interpretative quality in\r\nadvance of his time, states in 1823 (=6=,74) regarding the dip of the\r\nConnecticut valley rocks:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “There is reason to believe that Mount Toby, the strata of which are\r\n  almost horizontal, exhibits the original dip of these rocks, and that\r\n  those cases in which they are more highly inclined are the result of\r\n  some Plutonian convulsion. Such irregularity in the dip of coal fields\r\n  is no uncommon occurrence.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Hitchcock’s Geology of Massachusetts, published in 1833, ten years\r\nlater, geological structure sections of the Connecticut Valley rocks are\r\ngiven, the facts are discussed in detail and the dip ascribed to the\r\nelevatory forces. He says (l. c., pp. 213, 223):\r\n\r\n\r\n  “If it were possible to doubt that the new red sandstone formation was\r\n  deposited from water, the surface of some of the layers of this shale\r\n  would settle the question demonstrably. For it exhibits precisely\r\n  those gentle undulations, which the loamy bottom of every river with a\r\n  moderate current, presents. (No. 198.) But such a surface could never\r\n  have been formed while the layers had that high inclination to the\r\n  horizon, which many of them now present: so that we have here, also,\r\n  decisive evidence that they have been elevated subsequently to their\r\n  deposition....\r\n\r\n  The objection of a writer in the American Journal of Science, that\r\n  such a height of waters as would deposit Mount Toby, must have\r\n  produced a lake nearly to the upper part of New Hampshire, in the\r\n  Connecticut Valley, and thus have caused the same sandstone to be\r\n  produced higher up that valley than Northfield, loses its force, when\r\n  it is recollected that this formation was deposited before its strata\r\n  were elevated. For the elevating force undoubtedly changed the\r\n  relative level of different parts of the country. In this case, the\r\n  disturbing force must have acted beneath the primary rocks. And\r\n  besides, we have good evidence which will be shown by and by, that our\r\n  new red sandstone was formed beneath the ocean. We cannot then reason\r\n  on this subject from present levels.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Courtesy of _Popular Science Monthly_.]\r\n\r\nIn 1840, H. D. Rogers, a geologist who has acquired a more widely known\r\nname than Hitchcock, but who in reality showed an inferior ability in\r\ninterpretation, made the following statements in explanation of the\r\nregional monoclinal dip of the New Jersey Triassic rocks averaging 15 to\r\n20 degrees to the northwest:[78]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Their materials give evidence of having been swept into this estuary,\r\n  or great ancient river, from the south and southeast, by a current\r\n  producing an almost universal dip of the beds towards the northwest, a\r\n  feature clearly not caused by any uplifting agency, but assumed\r\n  originally at the time of their deposition, in consequence of the\r\n  setting of the current from the opposite or southeastern shore.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1842, at the third annual meeting of the Association of American\r\nGeologists both H. D. and W. B. Rogers argued (=43=, 170, 1842) against\r\nSir Charles Lyell and E. Hitchcock that the present dip of the Triassic\r\nwas the original slope of deposition, stating among other reasons that\r\nthe footprints impressed upon the sediments often showed a slipping and\r\na pushing of the soft clay in the direction of the downhill slope. In\r\n1858 H. D. Rogers still held to the same views of original dip,[79]\r\nnotwithstanding that a moderate amount of observation on the mud-cracked\r\nand rain-pitted layers would have supplied the proof that such must have\r\ndried as horizontal surfaces. The idea of inclined deposition is not yet\r\nwholly dead as it has been suggested more than once within the present\r\ngeneration as a means of escaping from the necessity of accepting the\r\nvery great thicknesses of this and similar formations. Thus, as Brögger\r\nhas remarked in another connection,—the ghosts of the old time stand\r\never ready to reappear.\r\n\r\nIn the present essay on the rise of structural geology as reflected\r\nthrough a century of publication in the Journal, attention will be given\r\nespecially to two fields, that of structures connected with igneous\r\nrocks and that of structures connected with mountain making, and\r\nemphasis will be placed upon the growth of understanding rather than\r\nupon the accumulating knowledge of details. The growth in both of these\r\ndivisions of structural geology is well illustrated in the volumes of\r\nthe Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Structures and Relationships of Igneous Rocks._\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Opposed Interpretations of Plutonists and Neptunists._\r\n\r\nDuring the first quarter of the nineteenth century the geologic\r\ncontroversy between the Plutonists and Neptunists was at its height; the\r\nPlutonists, following the Scotchman, Hutton, holding to the igneous\r\norigin of basalt and granite, the Neptunists, after their German master,\r\nWerner of Freiberg, maintaining that these rocks had been precipitated\r\nfrom a primitive universal ocean. The Plutonists, although time has\r\nshown them to have been correct in all essential particulars, were for a\r\ngeneration submerged under the propaganda carried forward by the\r\ndisciples of Werner. The “Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the\r\nEarth,” a remarkable classic, worthy of being studied to-day as well as\r\na century ago, was published in 1802 by John Playfair, professor of\r\nmathematics in the University of Edinburgh and a friend of Hutton, who\r\nhad died five years previously. This volume was opposed by Robert\r\nJameson, professor of natural philosophy in the same university, who had\r\nabsorbed the ideas of the German school while at Freiberg and published\r\nin 1808 a volume on the “Elements of Geognosy,” in which the philosophy\r\nof Werner is followed throughout and even obsidian and pumice are argued\r\nto be aqueous precipitates. The authority of the Wernerian autocracy\r\ncaused its nomenclature to be adopted in the new world, but strong\r\nevidence against its interpretations was to be found in the actual\r\nstructural relations displayed by the igneous rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Contributions on Volcanic and Intrusive Rocks._\r\n\r\nThe accumulation and study of facts constituted the best cure for an\r\nerroneous theory. The publications of the Journal contributed toward\r\nthis end by articles along several lines. The most original\r\ncontributions were those which dealt with the areal and structural\r\ngeology of eastern North America, but equally valuable at that time for\r\nthe broadening of scientific interest were the studies on the volcanic\r\nactivities of the Hawaiian Islands, published through many years.\r\nPerhaps most valuable from the educative standpoint were the extensive\r\nrepublications in the Journal of the more important European researches,\r\nmaking them accessible to American readers. In volume =13= (1828), for\r\nexample, a digest of Scrope’s work on volcanoes is given, covering forty\r\npages; and of Daubeny on active and extinct volcanoes, running over\r\nseventy-five pages and extending into vol. =14=. Through these\r\ncomprehensive studies the nature of volcanic action became generally\r\nunderstood during the first half of the nineteenth century and the\r\noriginal publications in the Journal were valuable in giving a knowledge\r\nof the activities of the Hawaiian volcanoes.\r\n\r\nEarly in the nineteenth century the whole of America still remained to\r\nbe explored by the geologist. The regions adjacent to the centers of\r\nlearning were among the first to receive attention and the Triassic\r\nbasin of Connecticut and Massachusetts yielded information in regard to\r\nthe nature of igneous intrusion. This basin, of unmetamorphic shales and\r\nsandstones, is occupied by the Connecticut River except at its southern\r\nend. The Formation contains within it sills, dikes, and outflows of\r\nbasaltic rocks which because of their superior resistance to erosion\r\nconstitute prominent hills, in places bounded by cliffs.\r\n\r\nSilliman in 1806[80] described East Rock, New Haven, Connecticut, as a\r\nwhinstone, trap, or basalt, and accounted for its presence on the\r\nsupposition that it had\r\n\r\n\r\n  “actually been melted in the bowels of the earth and ejected among the\r\n  superior strata by the force of subterraneous fire, but never erupted\r\n  like lava, cooling under the pressure of the superincumbent strata and\r\n  therefore compact or nonvesicular, its present form being due to\r\n  erosion.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these conclusions Silliman was correct. With but a limited amount of\r\nexperience he was able to discriminate between the intrusive and\r\neffusive rocks and saw that the prominence of this hill was due to the\r\nerosion of the sediments which once surrounded it.\r\n\r\nAn extensive paper on the geology of this region was published by Edward\r\nHitchcock in 1823,[81] then just thirty years of age. This paper shows\r\nthe evidence of extensive field observations, and his comments in regard\r\nto the trap and granite are of interest. Hitchcock gives five pages to\r\nthe subject of “Greenstone Dykes in Old Red Sandstone” (=6=, 56–60,\r\n1823) and makes the following statements:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Professor Silliman conducted me to an interesting locality of these\r\n  in East-Haven. They occur on the main road from New-Haven to\r\n  East-Haven, less than half a mile from Tomlinson’s bridge ... (p. 56).\r\n\r\n  They are an interesting feature in our geology, and deserve more\r\n  attention; and it is peculiarly fortunate that they should be situated\r\n  so near a geological school and the first mineral cabinet in our\r\n  country ... (p. 58).\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Origin of Greenstone.\r\n\r\n  Does the greenstone of the Connecticut afford evidence in favour of\r\n  the Wernerian or of the Huttonian theory of its origin? Averse as I\r\n  feel to taking a side in this controversy, I cannot but say, that the\r\n  man who maintains, in its length and breadth, the original hypothesis\r\n  of Werner in regard to the aqueous deposition of trap, will find it\r\n  for his interest, if he wishes to keep clear of doubts, not to follow\r\n  the example of D’Aubuisson, by going forth to examine the greenstone\r\n  of this region, lest, like that geologist, he should be compelled, not\r\n  only to abandon his theory, but to write a book against it. Indeed,\r\n  when surveying particular portions of this rock, I have sometimes\r\n  thought Bakewell did not much exaggerate when he said in regard to\r\n  Werner’s hypothesis, that, ‘it is hardly possible for the human mind\r\n  to invent a system more repugnant to existing facts.’\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, the Huttonian would doubtless have his heart\r\n  gladdened, and his faith strengthened by a survey of the greater part\r\n  of this rock. As he looked at the dikes of the old red sandstone, he\r\n  would almost see the melted rock forcing its way through the fissures;\r\n  and when he came to the amygdaloidal, especially to that variety which\r\n  resembles lava, he might even be tempted to apply his thermometer to\r\n  it, in the suspicion that it was not yet quite cool ... (p. 59).\r\n\r\n  By treating the subject in this manner I mean no disrespect to any of\r\n  the distinguished men who have adopted either side of this question.\r\n  To President Cooper especially, who regards the greenstone of the\r\n  Connecticut as volcanic, I feel much indebted for the great mass of\r\n  facts he has collected on the subject. And were I to adopt any\r\n  hypothesis in regard to the origin of our greenstone, it would be one\r\n  not much different from his” (p. 60).\r\n\r\n\r\nBy 1833 and more clearly in 1841 Hitchcock had come to recognize the\r\ndistinction between intrusive and extrusive basaltic sheets in the\r\nConnecticut valley. Dawson also came to regard the Acadian sheets as\r\nextrusive, and Emerson in 1882 recalled again the evidence for\r\nMassachusetts (=24=, 195, 1882). Davis, however, went a step further and\r\nby applying distinctive criteria not only separated intrusive and\r\nextrusive sheets throughout the whole Triassic area, but by using basalt\r\nflows as stratigraphic horizons unraveled for the first time the system\r\nof faults which cut the Triassic system. His preliminary paper (=24=,\r\n345, 1882) was followed by many others.\r\n\r\nFrom 1880 onward begins the period of precise structural field work. The\r\nolder geologists mostly conceived their work after reconnaissance\r\nmethods. From 1870 to 1880 a group of younger men entered geology who\r\npaid close attention to the solid geometry and mechanics of earth\r\nstructures. In their hands physical and dynamical geology began to\r\nassume the standing of a precise and quantitative science. In the field\r\nof intrusive rocks the opening classic was by Gilbert, who in his volume\r\non the geology of the Henry Mountains, published in 1880, made\r\nlaccoliths known to the world. With the beginning of this new period we\r\nmay well leave the subject of intrusive rocks and turn to the progress\r\nof knowledge in regard to those deeper and vaster bodies now known as\r\nbatholiths. These, since erosion does not expose their bottoms, Daly\r\nseparates from intrusives and classifies as subjacent. The batholiths\r\nconsist typically of granite and granodiorite, and introduce us to the\r\nproblem of granite.\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Views on the Structural Relations of Granite._\r\n\r\nConscientious field observations were sufficient to establish the true\r\nnature of the intrusive and extrusive rocks. The case was very\r\ndifferent, however, with the nature and relations of the great bodies of\r\ngranite, which may be taken in the structural sense as including all the\r\nvisibly crystalline acidic and intermediate rocks, known more\r\nspecifically as granite, syenite, and diorite.\r\n\r\nThe large bodies of granite, structurally classified as stocks, or\r\nbatholiths, commonly show wedges, tongues, or dike networks cutting into\r\nthe surrounding rocks. The relations, however, are not all so simple as\r\nthis. Granites may cover vast areas, they are usually the older rocks,\r\nthey are generally associated with regional metamorphism of the intruded\r\nformations, which metamorphism is now understood to be due chiefly to\r\nthe heat and mineralizers given off from the granite magma, associated\r\nwith mashing and shearing of the surrounding rocks. The granite was\r\noften injected in successive stages which alternated with the stages of\r\nregional mashing. A parallel or gneissic structure is thus developed\r\nwhich is in part due to mashing, in part to igneous injection. Where the\r\nascent of heat into the cover is excessive, or where blocks are detached\r\nand involved in the magma, the latter may dissolve some of the older\r\ncover rocks, even where these were of sedimentary origin.\r\n\r\nThus between mashing, injection, and assimilation the genetic\r\nrelationships of a batholith to its surroundings are in many instances\r\nobscure. Nevertheless, attention to the larger relations shows that the\r\nmolten magma originated at great depths in the earth’s crust, far below\r\nthe bottoms of geosynclines, and consists of primary igneous material,\r\nnot of fused sediments. From those depths it has ascended by various\r\nprocesses into the outer crust, where it crystallized into granite\r\nmasses, to be later exposed by erosion. The amount of material which can\r\nbe dissolved and assimilated must be small in comparison with the whole\r\nbody of the magma. The original composition of the magma was probably\r\nbasic, nearer that of a basalt than that of a granite. Differentiation\r\nof the molten mass is thought to cause the upper and lower parts of the\r\nchamber to become unlike, the lighter and more acidic portion giving\r\nrise to the great bodies of granite. With the exception of certain\r\nborder zones the whole, however, is regarded as igneous rock risen from\r\nthe depths.\r\n\r\nThe complex border relations, but more particularly certain academic\r\nhypotheses, led to a period of misunderstanding and retrogression in\r\nregard to the nature of granites. It constitutes an interesting\r\nillustration of the possibility of a wrong theory leading interpretation\r\nastray, chiefly through the magnification of minor into major factors.\r\nThis history illustrates the dangers of qualitative science as compared\r\nto quantitative, of a single hypothesis as matched against the method of\r\nmultiple working hypothesis. This flux of opinion in regard to the\r\nnature of granites may be traced through the volumes of the Journal.\r\n\r\nE. Hitchcock in 1824 (=6=, 12) noted that in places granite appeared\r\nbedded, but in other places existed in veins which cut obliquely across\r\nthe strata. Silliman, although careful not to deny the aqueous origin of\r\nsome basalts, yet held that the field evidence of New England indicates\r\nfor that region the igneous or Huttonian origin of trap and granite\r\n(=7=, 238, 1824).\r\n\r\nIn 1832 the following article by Hitchcock appeared in the Journal\r\n(=22=, 1, 70):\r\n\r\n\r\n  Report on the Geology of Massachusetts; examined under the direction\r\n  of the Government of that State, during the years 1830 and 1831; by\r\n  Edward Hitchcock, Prof. of Chemistry and Natural History in Amherst\r\n  College.\r\n\r\n  A footnote adds that this is “published in this Journal by consent of\r\n  the Government of Massachusetts, and intended to appear also in a\r\n  separate form, and to be distributed among the members of the\r\n  Legislature of the same State, about the time of its appearance in\r\n  this work. It is, we believe, the first example in this country, of\r\n  the geological survey of an entire State.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis article includes a geological map of the state and covers the\r\nsubject of economic geology. The report brought forth the following\r\nremarks from a French reviewer in the _Revue Encyclopédique_, Aug. 1832,\r\nquoted in the Journal (=23=, 389, 1833):\r\n\r\n\r\n  “A single glance at this report, is sufficient to convince any one of\r\n  the utility of such a work, to the state which has undertaken it; and\r\n  to regret that there is so very small a part of the French territory,\r\n  whose geological constitution is as well known to the public, as is\r\n  now the state of Massachusetts. France has the greater cause to regret\r\n  her being distanced in this race by America, from her having a corps\r\n  of mining engineers, who if they had the means, would, in a very short\r\n  time furnish a work of the same kind, still more complete, of each of\r\n  the departments.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe complete report published in 1833 is a work of 700 pages. Pages 465\r\nto 517 are devoted to the subject of granite. Numerous detailed sketches\r\nare given showing contact relations. Nine pages are given to theoretical\r\nconsiderations and many lines of proof are given that granite is an\r\nigneous rock, molten from the internal heat of the earth, and intruded\r\ninto the sedimentary strata. His statement is the clearest published in\r\nthe world, so far as the writer is aware, up to that date, and marks\r\nEdward Hitchcock as one of the leading geologists of his generation in\r\nEurope as well as America. Unfortunately his views were largely lost to\r\nsight during the following generation.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 the first American edition of Mantell’s Wonders of Geology gave\r\ncurrency to the idea that granite is proved to be of all geological ages\r\nup to the Tertiary (=39=, 6, 1840). In 1843 J. D. Dana pointed out\r\n(=45=, 104) that schistosity was no evidence of sedimentary origin. He\r\nregarded most granites as igneous as shown by their structural\r\nrelations, but considers that some may have had a sedimentary origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Rise and Decline of the Metamorphic Theory of Granite._\r\n\r\nUp to 1860 granite was regarded on the basis of the facts of the field\r\nas essentially an intrusive rock, but gneiss as a metamorphic product\r\nmostly of sedimentary origin. It seemed as though sound methods of\r\nresearch and interpretation were securely established. Nevertheless, a\r\nnew era of speculation and a modified Wernerism arose at that time with\r\na paper by T. Sterry Hunt, marking a retrogression in the theory of\r\ngranite which lasted until his death in 1892.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1859, Hunt read before the Geological Society of London a\r\npaper on “Some Points in Chemical Geology” in which he announced that\r\nigneous rocks are in all cases simply fused and displaced sediments, the\r\nfusion taking place by the rise of the earth’s internal heat into deeply\r\nburied and water-soaked masses of sediments (see =30=, 133, 1860). The\r\ngerm of this idea of aqueo-igneous fusion was far older, due to Babbage\r\nand John Herschel, neither of them geologists, but such sweeping\r\nextensions of it had never before been published. Hunt had the advantage\r\nof a wide acquaintanceship with geological literature and chemistry. He\r\nwrote plausibly on chemical and theoretical geology, but his views were\r\nnot controlled by careful field observations. In fact he wrote\r\nconfidently on regions which apparently he had never seen and where a\r\nlimited amount of field work would have shown him to have been\r\nfundamentally in error. A man of egotistical temperament, he sought to\r\nestablish priority for himself in many subjects and in order to cover\r\nthe field made many poorly founded assertions. Building on to another\r\nWernerian idea, he held that many metamorphic minerals had a chronologic\r\nvalue comparable to fossils—staurolite for example indicating a\r\npre-Silurian age—and on this basis divided the crystalline rocks into\r\nfive series. Although there is much of value buried in Hunt’s work it is\r\ndifficult to disentangle it, with the result that his writings were a\r\ndisservice to the science of geology. Although carrying much weight in\r\nhis lifetime, they have passed with his death nearly into oblivion.\r\n\r\nMarcou, with a limited knowledge of American geology, and but little\r\nrespect for the opinions of others, had published a geologic map of the\r\nUnited States containing gross errors. In support of his views he read\r\nin November, 1861, a paper on the Taconic and Lower Silurian Rocks of\r\nVermont and Canada. In the following year he was severely reviewed by\r\n“T,” who states positively in controverting Marcou (=33=, 282, 283,\r\n1862) that “the granites (of the Green Mountains) are evidently strata\r\naltered in place.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Marcou should further be informed that the granites of the Alpine\r\n  summits, instead of being, as was once supposed, eruptive rocks, are\r\n  now known to be altered strata of newer Secondary and Tertiary age. A\r\n  simple structure holds good in the British Islands, where as Sir\r\n  Roderick Murchison has shown in his recent Geological map of Scotland,\r\n  Ben Nevis and Ben Lawers are found to be composed of higher strata,\r\n  lying in synclinals. This great law of mountain structure would alone\r\n  lead us to suppose that the gneiss of the Green mountains, instead of\r\n  being at the base, is really at the summit of the series....\r\n\r\n  We cannot here stop to discuss Mr. Marcou’s remark about ‘the\r\n  unstratified and oldest crystalline rocks of the White mountains’\r\n  which he places beneath the lower Taconic series. Mr. Lesley has shown\r\n  that these granites are stratified, and with Mr. Hunt, regards them as\r\n  of Devonian Age. (This Journal, vol. =31=, p. 403.) Mr. Marcou has\r\n  come among us with notions of mountains upheaved by intrusive\r\n  granites, and similar antiquated traditions, now, happily for science,\r\n  well nigh forgotten.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is seen that Marcou, notwithstanding the general character of his\r\nwork, happened to be nearer right in some matters than were his critics,\r\nand that “T” had adopted to the limit the views of Hunt.\r\n\r\nThe recovery of geology from this period of confusion was partly owing\r\nto the slow accumulation of opposed facts; especially to a recognition\r\nof the fact that the overplaced relation of the granite gneisses in\r\nwestern Scotland was due to great overthrusts; also to the evidence of\r\nthe clearly intrusive nature of many of the Cordilleran granites. The\r\nrecovery of a sounder theory was hastened, however, by the application\r\nof criticisms by J. D. Dana in the Journal. In 1866 (=42=, 252) Dana\r\npointed out that sedimentary rocks in Pennsylvania, in Nova Scotia, and\r\nother regions which had been buried to a depth of at least 16,000 feet\r\nare not metamorphic. Mere depth of burial of sediments was not\r\nsufficient therefore to produce metamorphism and aqueo-igneous fusion.\r\nThe baseless and speculative character of the use of minerals as an\r\nindex of age and of Hunt’s interpretation of New England geology in\r\ngeneral was shown by Dana in 1872 (=3=, 91). The following year Dana\r\npointed out clearly that igneous eruptions in general have been derived\r\nfrom a deep-seated source and did not come from the aqueo-igneous fusion\r\nof sediments. As to gradations between true igneous rocks and fused and\r\ndisplaced sediments he makes the following statements (=6=, 114, 1873):\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Again, the plastic rock-material that may be derived from the fusion\r\n  or semifusion of the supercrust, (that is, of rocks originally of\r\n  sedimentary origin,) gives rise to “igneous” rocks often not\r\n  distinguishable from other igneous rocks, when it is ejected through\r\n  fissures far from its place of origin; while crystalline rocks are\r\n  simply _metamorphic_ if they remain in their original relations to the\r\n  associated rocks, or nearly so.\r\n\r\n  Between these latter igneous rocks and the metamorphic there may be\r\n  indefinite gradations, as claimed by Hunt. But if our reasonings are\r\n  right, the great part of igneous rocks can be proved to have had no\r\n  such supercrust origin. The argument from the presence of moisture or\r\n  of hydrous minerals in such rocks in favor of their origin from the\r\n  fusion of sediments has been shown to be invalid.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe injected marginal rocks and the post-intrusive metamorphism of most\r\nof the New England granites has, however, obscured more or less their\r\nreal igneous nature so that the gradation from metamorphic sediments\r\nthrough igneous gneisses to granites could be read in either direction.\r\nThese features misled Dana who accepted the prevailing idea of the\r\ngeneral metamorphic origin of granite. Dana makes the following\r\nstatement (=6=, 164, 1873):\r\n\r\n\r\n  “But Hunt is right in holding that in general granite and syenite (the\r\n  quartz-bearing syenite) are undoubtedly metamorphic rocks where not\r\n  vein-formations, as I know from the study of many examples of them in\r\n  New England; and the veins are results of infiltration through heated\r\n  moisture from the rocks adjoining some part of the opened fissures\r\n  they fill.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGranite, although regarded at this time as the extreme of the\r\nmetamorphic series and originating from sediments, was looked upon as\r\ntypically Archean in age, though in some cases younger. Such a doctrine\r\npermitted such extreme misinterpretations as that of Clarence King and\r\nS. F. Emmons on the nature of the intrusive granite of the Little\r\nCottonwood canyon in the Wahsatch Range. This body cuts across 30,000\r\nfeet of Paleozoic rocks and to the careful observer, as later admitted\r\nby Emmons, shows clear evidence of its transgressive nature. But at that\r\ntime it was generally considered that granite mountains were capable of\r\nresisting the erosion of all geological time. Consequently it did not\r\nseem incredible to King and his associates that here a great granite\r\nrange of Archean origin had stood up through Paleozoic time until\r\ngradual subsidence had permitted it to be buried beneath 30,000 feet of\r\nsediments.[82]\r\n\r\nIt may seem to the present day reader that such a misinterpretation,\r\ndoing violence to fundamental geologic knowledge as now recognized, was\r\ninexcusable; but in the light of the history of geology as here detailed\r\nit is seen to have been the interpretation natural to that time. It is\r\ntrue that a careful examination of the facts of that very field would\r\nhave proved the post-Paleozoic and intrusive nature of that great\r\ngranite body now known as the Little Cottonwood batholith, but Emmons\r\nhas explained the rapid and partial nature of the observations which\r\nthey were compelled to make in order to keep up to their schedule of\r\nprogress (=16=, 139, 1903).\r\n\r\nWhitney had found some years earlier that the granites of the Sierra\r\nNevada were igneous rocks intrusive into the Triassic and Jurassic\r\nstrata. The Lake Superior geologists began to show in the eighties that\r\ngranite was there an intrusive igneous rock. R. D. Irving and Wadsworth\r\nnoted these relations. Lawson in 1887 pointed out emphatically (=33=,\r\n473) that the granites of the Rainy Lake region, although basal, were\r\nyounger than the schists which lay above them. The granite gneisses he\r\nheld were of clearly the same igneous origin as the granites and neither\r\ngave any field evidence of being fused and displaced sediments. From\r\nthis time forward the truly igneous nature of granite became\r\nincreasingly accepted until now the notion of its being made of\r\nsedimentary rocks softened and recrystallized by the rise of the\r\nisogeotherms through deep burial is as obsolete as the still older\r\ndoctrine of the Neptunists that granite was laid down as a crystalline\r\nprecipitate on the floor of the primitive ocean.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the truly igneous nature of granites has been\r\nfollowed in the present generation by a series of studies on their\r\nstructural relations and mode of genesis. A number of important initial\r\narticles on various aspects of structure and contact relations have\r\nappeared in the Journal, but this sketch of the history of the subject\r\nmay well stop with the introduction to this modern period.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Orogenic Structures._\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Views of Plutonists and Neptunists._\r\n\r\nOrogenic structures are, as the name implies, those connected with the\r\nbirth of mountains. Nearly synonymous terms are deformative or secondary\r\nstructures. On a small scale this division embraces the phenomena\r\nexposed in the rock ledge or quarry face, or in the dips and\r\ndislocations varying from one exposure to another. These structures\r\ninclude faults, folds, and foliation. On a larger scale are included the\r\nrelations of the different ranges of a mountain system to each other,\r\nrelations to previous geologic history, relations to the earth as a\r\nwhole, and to the forces which have generated the structures.\r\n\r\nIn order to see the stage of development of this subject in 1818 and its\r\nprogress as reflected through the publications of a century, more\r\nparticularly in the Journal, it is desirable to turn again to those two\r\ntreatises emanating from Edinburgh at the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury and representing two opposite schools of thought, the Plutonists\r\nand Neptunists.\r\n\r\nPlayfair, in 1802, devotes nineteen pages to the subject of the\r\ninflection and elevation of strata.[83] He places emphasis on the\r\ncharacteristic parallelism of the strike of the folds throughout a\r\nregion, as shown through the intersection of the folds by a horizontal\r\nplane of erosion. He contrasts this with the arches shown in a\r\ntransverse section and enlarges on our ability to study the deeply\r\nburied strata through the denudation of the folded structure. He argues\r\nfrom these relations that the structures can not be explained by the\r\nvague appeal of the Neptunists to forces of crystallization, to slopes\r\nof original deposition, or to sinking in of the roofs of caverns. The\r\ncauses he argues were heat combined with pressure. As to the directions\r\nin which the pressure acted he is not altogether clear, but apparently\r\nregards the pressure as acting in upward thrusts against the sedimentary\r\nplanes, the latter yielding as warped surfaces. His method of\r\npresentation is that of inductive reasoning from facts, but he stopped\r\nshort of the conception of horizontal compression through terrestrial\r\ncontraction.\r\n\r\nJameson, professor of natural history in the same university, in 1808\r\ncontemptuously ignores the work of Hutton and Playfair in what he calls\r\nthe “_monstrosities_ known under the name of Theories of the Earth.” In\r\na couple of pages he confuses and dismisses the whole subject of\r\ndeformation. He states:[84]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “It is therefore a fact, that all inclined strata, with a very few\r\n  exceptions, have been formed so originally, and do not owe their\r\n  inclination to a subsequent change.\r\n\r\n  When we examine the structure of a mountain, we must be careful that\r\n  our observations be not too micrological, otherwise we shall\r\n  undoubtedly fail in acquiring a distinct conception of it. This will\r\n  appear evident when we reflect that the geognostic features of Nature\r\n  are almost all on the great scale. In no case is this rule to be more\r\n  strictly followed than in the examination of the stratified structure.\r\n\r\n  By not attending to this mode of examination, geognosts have fallen\r\n  into numberless errors, and have frequently given to extensive tracts\r\n  of country a most irregular and confused structure. Speculators\r\n  building on these errors have represented the whole crust of the globe\r\n  as an irregular and unseemly mass. It is indeed surprising, that men\r\n  possessed of any knowledge of the beautiful harmony that prevails in\r\n  the structure of organic beings could for a moment believe it\r\n  possible, that the great fabric of the globe itself,—that magnificent\r\n  display of Omnipotence,—should be destitute of all regularity in its\r\n  structure, and be nothing more than a heap of ruins.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the attitude of a leader of British opinion toward the subject\r\nof deformational geology from which the infant science had to recover\r\nbefore progress could be made. The early maps were essentially\r\nmineralogical and lithological. The order of superposition and the\r\nconsequent sequence of age was regarded as settled by Werner in Germany\r\nand not requiring investigation in America. The early examples of\r\nstructure were sections drawn with exaggerated vertical scales and those\r\nof Maclure do not show detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _Recognition of Appalachian Structures._\r\n\r\nFollowing the founding of the Journal in 1818 there is observable a\r\ngrowth in the quality and detail of geological mapping. Dr. Aiken,\r\nprofessor of natural philosophy and chemistry in Mt. St. Mary’s College,\r\npublished in the Journal in 1834 (=26=, 219) a vertical section\r\nextending between Baltimore and Wheeling, a distance of nearly 250\r\nmiles, on a scale of about 7 miles per inch. The succession of rocks is\r\ncarefully shown and the direction of dip, but no attempt is made to show\r\nthe underground relations, the stratigraphic sequence, and the folded\r\nstructures which are so clear in that Appalachian section. The text also\r\nshows that the author had not recognized the folded structure.\r\nFurthermore, where the folds cease at the Alleghany mountain front, the\r\nflat strata are shown as resting unconformably on the folded rocks to\r\nthe east.\r\n\r\nR. C. Taylor, geologist, civil and mining engineer, was from 1830 to\r\n1835 the leading student of Pennsylvanian geology as shown by the\r\npublication in 1835 of four papers aggregating over 80 pages in the\r\nTransactions of the Geological Society of Pennsylvania. His work is\r\nnoticeable for accuracy in detail and no doubt was influential in\r\nsetting a high standard for the state geological survey which\r\nimmediately followed.\r\n\r\nH. D. and W. B. Rogers have been given credit in this country, and in\r\nEurope also, as being the leading expounders of Appalachian structure.\r\nMerrill speaks of H. D. Rogers as unquestionably the leading structural\r\ngeologist of his time.[85] To the writer, this attributed position\r\nappears to be due to his opportunities rather than to scientific acumen.\r\nThe magnificent but readily decipherable folded structure of\r\nPennsylvania, the relationships of coal and iron to this structure, the\r\nconsiderable sums of money appropriated, and the work of a corps of able\r\nassistants were factors which made it comparatively easy to reach\r\nimportant results. In ability to weigh facts and interpret them Edward\r\nHitchcock showed much more insight than H. D. Rogers, while in the\r\nphilosophic and comprehensive aspects of the subject J. D. Dana far\r\noutranks him.\r\n\r\nH. D. Rogers in his first report on the geological survey of New Jersey,\r\n1836, recognizes that the Cambro-Silurian limestones (lower Secondary\r\nlimestones) were deposited as nearly horizontal beds and the ridges of\r\npre-Cambrian gneiss (Primary) had been pushed up as anticlinal axes (p.\r\n128). He also clearly recognized the distinction between slaty cleavage\r\nand true dip as shown in the Ordovician slates (p. 97). Between 1836 and\r\n1840 he had learned a great deal on the nature of folds as is shown in\r\nhis Pennsylvania report for 1839 and the structure sections in his New\r\nJersey report for 1840.\r\n\r\nR. C. Taylor, who had now become president of the board of directors of\r\nthe Dauphin and Susquehanna Coal Company, published in the Journal in\r\n1841 (=41=, 80) an important paper entitled “Notice of a Model of the\r\nWestern portion of the Schuylkill or Southern Coal Field of\r\nPennsylvania, in illustration of an Address to the Association of\r\nAmerican Geologists, on the most appropriate modes for representing\r\nGeological Phenomena.” In this paper he calls attention to the value of\r\nmodeling as a means of showing true relations in three dimensions. He\r\ncondemns the custom prevalent among geologists of showing structure\r\nsections with an exaggerated vertical scale with its resultant\r\ntopographic and structural distortions. Taylor was widely acquainted\r\nwith the structure of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Nature of Forces Producing Folding._\r\n\r\nIn 1825 Dr. J. H. Steele sent to Professor Silliman two detailed\r\ndrawings and description of an overturned fold at Saratoga Lake, New\r\nYork. As to the significance of this feature Steele makes the following\r\nstatement (=9=, 3, 1825):\r\n\r\n\r\n  “It is impossible to examine this locality without being strongly\r\n  impressed with the belief that the position which the strata here\r\n  assume could not have been effected in any other way than by a power\r\n  operating from beneath upwards and at the same time possessing a\r\n  progressive force; something analogous to what takes place in the\r\n  breaking up of the ice of large rivers. The continued swelling of the\r\n  stream first overcomes the resistance of its frozen surface and having\r\n  elevated it to a certain extent, it is forced into a vertical\r\n  position, or thrown over upon the unbroken stratum behind, by the\r\n  progressive power of the current.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as the present writer is aware this is the first recognition in\r\ngeological literature of the evidence of a horizontally compressive and\r\noverturning force as a cause of folding.\r\n\r\nTo E. Hitchcock belongs the credit of being the first to describe\r\noverturning and inversion of strata on a large scale, but without\r\nclearly recognizing it as such. In western Massachusetts metamorphism is\r\nextreme in the lower Paleozoic rocks in the vicinity of the overthrust\r\nmass of Archean granite-gneiss which constitutes the Hoosic range. The\r\nPaleozoic rocks of the valley to the west are overturned and appear to\r\ndip beneath the older rocks. Farther west the metamorphism fades out and\r\nthe series assumes a normal position. Such an inverted relation, up to\r\nthat time unknown, is described in 1833 as follows by Hitchcock in his\r\nGeology of Massachusetts (pp. 297, 298):\r\n\r\n\r\n  “But a singular anomaly in the superposition of the series of rocks\r\n  above described, presents a great difficulty in this case. The strata\r\n  of these rocks almost uniformly dip to the east: that is, the newer\r\n  rocks seem to crop out beneath the older ones; so that the saccharine\r\n  limestone, associated with gneiss in the eastern part of the range,\r\n  seems to occupy the uppermost place in the series. Now as\r\n  superposition is of more value in determining the relative ages of\r\n  rocks than their mineral characters, must we not conclude that the\r\n  rocks, as we go westerly from Hoosac mountain, do in fact belong to\r\n  older groups? The petrifactions which some of them contain, and their\r\n  decidedly fragmentary character, will not allow such a supposition to\r\n  be indulged for a moment. It is impossible for a geologist to mistake\r\n  the evidence, which he sees at almost every step, that he is passing\r\n  from older to newer formations, just as soon as he begins to cross the\r\n  valley of Berkshire towards the west. We are driven then to the\r\n  alternative of supposing, either that there must be a deception in the\r\n  apparent outcrop of the newer rocks from beneath the older, or that\r\n  the whole series of strata has been actually thrown over, so as to\r\n  bring the newest rocks at the bottom. The latter supposition is so\r\n  improbable that I cannot at present admit it.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHitchcock tried to reconcile the evidence by a series of unconformities\r\nand inclined deposition, but finds the solution unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn this same year, 1833, Elie de Beaumont, a distinguished French\r\ngeologist, published his theory of the origin of mountains. He advanced\r\nthe idea that since the globe was cooling it was condensing, and the\r\ncrust, already cool, must suffer compression in adjusting itself to the\r\nshrinking molten interior. He concluded from the evidence shown in\r\nEurope that the collapse of the crust occurred violently and rapidly at\r\nwidely spaced intervals of time. This hypothesis introduced the idea of\r\nmountain folding by horizontal compressive forces. The theoretical paper\r\nof de Beaumont, together with further observations by Hitchcock and\r\nothers, led the latter in 1841 to a final belief in the inversion of\r\nstrata on a large scale by horizontal compression. His conclusions are\r\nexpressed in an important paper published in the Journal (=41=, 268,\r\n1841) and given on April 8, 1841, as the First Anniversary Presidential\r\nAddress before the Association of American Geologists. This\r\ncomprehensive summary of American geology occupies 43 pages. Three pages\r\nare given to the inverted structure of the Appalachians from which the\r\nfollowing paragraphs may be quoted:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “We have all read of the enormous dislocations and inversions of the\r\n  strata of the Alps; and similar phenomena are said to exist in the\r\n  Andes. Will it be believed, that we have an example in the United\r\n  States on a still more magnificent scale than any yet described?...\r\n\r\n  Let us suppose the strata between Hudson and Connecticut rivers, while\r\n  yet in the plastic state, (and the supposition may be extended to any\r\n  other section across this belt of country from Canada to Alabama,) and\r\n  while only slightly elevated, were acted upon by a force at the two\r\n  rivers, exerted in opposite directions. If powerful enough, it might\r\n  cause them to fold up into several ridges; and if more powerful along\r\n  the western than the eastern side, they might fall over so as to take\r\n  an inverted dip, without producing any remarkable dislocations, while\r\n  subsequent denudation would give to the surface its present\r\n  outline....\r\n\r\n  Fourthly, we should readily admit that such a plication and inversion\r\n  of the strata might take place on a small scale. If for instance, we\r\n  were to press against the extremities of a series of plastic layers\r\n  two feet long, they could easily be made to assume the position into\r\n  which the rocks under consideration are thrown. Why then should we not\r\n  be equally ready to admit that this might as easily be done, over a\r\n  breadth of fifty miles, and a length of twelve hundred, provided we\r\n  can find in nature, forces sufficiently powerful? Finally, such forces\r\n  do exist in nature, and have often been in operation.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advanced nature of these conceptions may be appreciated by\r\ncontrasting them with those put forth by H. D. and W. B. Rogers on April\r\n29, 1842, before the third annual meeting of the same body (=43=, 177,\r\n1842) and repeated by them before the British Association at Manchester\r\ntwo months later. In their own words, the Rogers brothers from their\r\nstudies on the folds shown in Pennsylvania and Virginia, conceived\r\nmountain folds in general to be produced by much elastic vapor escaping\r\nthrough many parallel fissures formed in succession, producing violent\r\npropulsive wave oscillations on the surface of the fluid earth beneath a\r\nthin crust. Thus actual billows are assumed to have rolled along through\r\nthe crust. They did not think tangential pressure alone could produce\r\nfolds. Such pressures were regarded as secondary, produced by the\r\npropagation of the waves and the only expression of tangential forces\r\nwhich they admitted was to fix the folds and hold them in position after\r\nthe violent oscillation had subsided (=44=, 360, 1843). The leading\r\nBritish geologists De la Beche and Sedgwick criticized adversely this\r\nremarkable theory, stating that they could see no such analogy in\r\nmountain folds to violent earthquake waves and that in their opinion the\r\nslow application of tangential force was sufficient to account for the\r\nphenomena (=44=, 362–365, 1843).\r\n\r\nH. D. Rogers in the prosecution of the geological survey of Pennsylvania\r\ndisplayed notable organizing ability and persistence in accomplishment,\r\neven to advancing personally considerable sums of money, trusting to the\r\nstate legislature to later reimburse him. Finally, after many delays by\r\nthe state, the publication was placed directly in his charge and he\r\nproduced in 1858 a magnificent quarto work of over 1,600 pages,\r\nhandsomely illustrated, and accompanied by an atlas. It is excellent\r\nfrom the descriptive standpoint, standing in the first class. Measured\r\nas a contribution to the theory of dynamical geology, the explanatory\r\nportions were, however, thirty years behind the times. The same\r\nhypotheses are put forth in 1858 as in 1842. There is no acceptance of\r\nthe views of Lyell concerning the uniformitarian principles expounded by\r\nthis British leader in 1830, or of the nature of orogenic forces as\r\npublished by Elie de Beaumont in 1833. Rogers rejects the view that\r\ncleavage is due to compression and suggests “that both cleavage and\r\nfoliation are due to the parallel transmission of planes or waves of\r\nheat, awakening the molecular forces, and determining their\r\ndirection.”[86] Thus a mere maze of words takes the place of inductive\r\ndemonstrations already published.\r\n\r\nIn following the play of these opposing currents of geologic thought we\r\nreach now the point where a period of brilliant progress in the\r\nknowledge of mountains and of continental structures begins in the work\r\nof J. D. Dana. In 1842 Dana returned from the Wilkes Exploring\r\nExpedition and the following year began the publication of the series of\r\npapers which for the next half century marked him as the leader in\r\ngeologic theory in America. His work is of course to be judged against\r\nthe background of his times. His papers mark distinct advances in many\r\nlines and are characterized throughout by breadth of conception and\r\nespecially by clear and logical thinking. His work was published very\r\nlargely in the Journal, of which after a few years he became chief\r\neditor. His first contribution on the subject of mountain structures,\r\nentitled “Geological results of the earth’s contraction in consequence\r\nof cooling,” was published in 1847 (=3=, 176). The evidence of\r\nhorizontal pressure was first perceived in France as shown by the\r\nfeatures of the Alps. Elie de Beaumont connected it, by means of the\r\ntheory of a cooling and contracting globe, with the other large fact of\r\nthe increase of temperature with descent in the crust. Dana credits the\r\nRogers brothers with first making known the folded structures of the\r\nAppalachians, but objects to their interpretation of origin. He showed\r\nby means of diagrams that the folds are to be explained by lateral\r\npressure, the direction of overturning indicating the direction from\r\nwhich the driving force proceeded.\r\n\r\nThe Rogers brothers and especially James Hall, in working out the\r\nAppalachian stratigraphy, had noted that the formations, although\r\naccumulating to a maximum thickness of between 30,000 and 40,000 feet,\r\nshowed evidences that the successive formations were deposited in\r\nshallow water. It suggested to them that the weight of the accumulating\r\nsediments was the cause of subsidence, each foot of sediment causing a\r\nfoot of down sinking. This idea has continued to run through various\r\ntext books in geology for half a century, yet Dana early saw the fallacy\r\nand in 1863 in the first edition of his Manual of Geology (p. 717)\r\nstates “whether this is an actual cause or not in geological dynamics is\r\nquestionable.” In 1866 in an important article on “Observations on the\r\norigins of some of the earth’s features,” Dana deals more fully and\r\nfinally with this subject (=42=, 205, 252, 1866). He shows that such an\r\neffect of accumulating sediment postulates a delicate balance, a very\r\nthin crust and no resistance below. If such a weakness were granted it\r\nwould be impossible for the earth to hold up mountains. Furthermore such\r\nsubsidence was not regular during its progress and finally in the long\r\ncourse of geologic time gave place to a reverse movement of elevation.\r\n\r\nHall had pointed out the fact that the sediments were thickest on the\r\neast in the region of mountain folding and thinned out to a fraction of\r\nthis thickness in the broad Mississippi basin. Hall argued that the mere\r\nsubsidence of the trough would produce the observed folding and that the\r\nfolding was unrelated to mountain making or crustal shortening. In\r\nsupposed proof he cited the fact that the Catskills consist of unfolded\r\nrock, are higher than the folded region to the south, and nearly as high\r\nas the highest metamorphic mountains to the east.[87] Hall and all his\r\ncontemporaries were handicapped in their geological theories by a\r\ncomplete inappreciation of the importance of subaërial denudation. For\r\nsubscribing to these errors of their time even the ablest men should not\r\nbe held responsible. Hall was the most forcible personality in geology\r\nin his generation. His contributions to paleontology were superb. His\r\nperception of the relation existing between troughs of thick sediments\r\nand folded structures was a contribution of the first importance; yet in\r\nthe structural field his argument as to the production of the\r\nAppalachian folds by mere subsidence during deposition indicates a\r\nremarkable inability to apply the logical consequences of his hypothesis\r\nto the nature of the folds as already made known by the Rogers. Dana\r\npointed out in reply to Hall that the folding did not correspond to the\r\nrequirements of Hall’s hypothesis, especially as the folding took place\r\nnot during, but after the close of the vast Paleozoic deposition. Dana\r\nstates in conclusion on Hall’s hypothesis (=42=, 209, 1866) that “It is\r\na theory of the origin of mountains with the origin of mountains left\r\nout.”\r\n\r\n\r\n             _The Theory of Geosynclines and Geanticlines._\r\n\r\nThe fact that systems of folded strata lie along axes of especially\r\nthick sediments and that this implied subsidence during deposition was\r\nHall’s contribution to geologic theory, but curiously enough he failed,\r\nas shown, to connect it with the subsequent nature of mountain folding.\r\nHe did not see why such troughs should be weak to resist horizontal\r\ncompression. The clear recognition of this relationship was the\r\ncontribution of Le Conte, who in a paper on “A theory of the formation\r\nof the great features of the earth’s surface” (=4=, 345, 460, 1872),\r\nreached the conclusion that “mountain chains are formed by the mashing\r\ntogether and the up-swelling of sea bottoms where immense thicknesses of\r\nsediment have accumulated.”\r\n\r\nAs to the cause why mashing should take place along troughs of thick\r\nsediments Le Conte adopts the hypothesis of aqueo-igneous fusion\r\nproposed independently long before by Babbage and Herschel and\r\nelaborated into a theory of igneous rocks by Hunt. Under this view, as\r\nthe older sediments became deeply buried, the heat of the earth’s\r\ninterior ascended into them, and since they included the water of\r\nsedimentation a softening and metamorphism resulted. Dana had shown,\r\nhowever, six years previously (=42=, 252, 1866), as the following\r\nquotation will indicate, that metamorphism of sediments required more\r\nthan deep burial and that no such weakening as was postulated by\r\nHerschel had occurred:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The correctness of Herschel’s principle cannot be doubted. But the\r\n  question of its actual agency in ordinary metamorphism must be decided\r\n  by an appeal to facts; and on this point I would here present a few\r\n  facts for consideration.\r\n\r\n  The numbers and boldness of the flexures in the rocks of most\r\n  metamorphic regions have always seemed to me to bear against the view\r\n  that the heat causing the change had ascended by the very quiet method\r\n  recognized in this theory....\r\n\r\n  But there are other facts indicating a limited sufficiency to this\r\n  means of metamorphism. These are afforded by the great faults and\r\n  sections of strata open to examination. In the Appalachian region,\r\n  both of Virginia and Pennsylvania, faults occur, as described by the\r\n  Professors Rogers, and by Mr. J. P. Lesley, which afford us important\r\n  data for conclusions. Mr. Lesley, an excellent geologist and\r\n  geological observer, who has explored personally the regions referred\r\n  to, states that at the great fault of Juniata and Blair Cos.,\r\n  Pennsylvania, the rocks of the Trenton period are brought up to a\r\n  level with those of the Chemung, making a dislocation of at least\r\n  16,000, and probably of 20,000, feet. And yet the Trenton limestone\r\n  and Hudson River shales are not metamorphic. Some local cases of\r\n  alteration occur there, including patches of roofing slate; but the\r\n  greater part of the shales are no harder than the ordinary shales of\r\n  the Pennsylvania Coal formation.\r\n\r\n  At a depth of 16,000 feet the temperature of the earth’s crust,\r\n  allowing an increase of 1° F. for 60 feet of descent, would be about\r\n  330° F.; or with 1° F. for 50 feet, about 380° F.—either of which\r\n  temperatures is far above the boiling point of water; and with the\r\n  thinner crust of Paleozoic time the temperature at this depth should\r\n  have been still higher. But, notwithstanding this heat, and also the\r\n  compression from so great an overlying mass, the limestones and shales\r\n  are not crystalline. The change of parts of the shale to roofing slate\r\n  is no evidence in favor of the efficiency of the alleged cause; for\r\n  such a cause should act uniformly over great areas.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next contribution to the theory of orogeny was a series of papers\r\npublished in 1873 by Dana, entitled “On some results of the earth’s\r\ncontraction from cooling, including a discussion on the origin of\r\nmountains and the nature of the earth’s interior.”[88] This\r\ncontribution, viewed as a whole, ranks among the first half dozen papers\r\non the science of mountains. The following quoted paragraphs give a view\r\nof the scope of this article:\r\n\r\n\r\n                 “_Kinds and Structure of Mountains._”\r\n\r\n  “While mountains and mountain chains all over the world, and low\r\n  lands, also, have undergone uplifts, in the course of their long\r\n  history, that are not explained on the idea that all mountain\r\n  elevating is simply what may come from plication or crushing, the\r\n  _component parts_ of mountain chains, or those simple mountains or\r\n  mountain ranges that are the product of one _process of making_—may\r\n  have received, _at the time of their original making_, no elevation\r\n  beyond that resulting from plication.\r\n\r\n  This leads us to a grand distinction in orography, hitherto neglected,\r\n  which is fundamental and of the highest interest in dynamical geology;\r\n  a distinction between—\r\n\r\n  1. A simple or _individual_ mountain mass or range, which is the\r\n  result of _one process of making_, like an individual in any process\r\n  of evolution, and which may be distinguished as a _monogenetic_ range,\r\n  being _one in genesis_; and\r\n\r\n  2. A composite or _polygenetic_ range or chain, made up of two or more\r\n  monogenetic ranges combined.\r\n\r\n  The Appalachian chain—the mountain region along the Atlantic border of\r\n  North America—is a _polygenetic_ chain; it consists, like the Rocky\r\n  and other mountain chains, of several _monogenetic_ ranges, the more\r\n  important of which are: 1. The Highland range (including the Blue\r\n  Ridge or parts of it, and the Adirondacks also, if these belong to the\r\n  same process of making) pre-Silurian in formation; 2. The Green\r\n  Mountain range, in western New England and eastern New York, completed\r\n  essentially after the Lower Silurian era or during its closing period;\r\n  3. The Alleghany range, extending from southern New York southwestward\r\n  to Alabama, and completed immediately after the Carboniferous age.\r\n\r\n  The making of the Alleghany range was carried forward at first through\r\n  a long-continued subsidence—a _geosynclinal_ (not a _true_ synclinal,\r\n  since the rocks of the bending crust may have had in them many true or\r\n  simple synclinals as well as anticlinals), and a consequent\r\n  accumulation of sediments, which occupied the whole of Paleozoic time;\r\n  and it was completed, finally, in great breakings, faultings and\r\n  foldings or plications of the strata, along with other results of\r\n  disturbance.\r\n\r\n  These examples exhibit the characteristics of a large class of\r\n  mountain masses or ranges. A geosynclinal accompanied by sedimentary\r\n  depositions, and ending in a catastrophe of plications and\r\n  solidification, are the essential steps, while metamorphism and\r\n  igneous ejections are incidental results. The process is one that\r\n  produces final stability in the mass and its annexation generally to\r\n  the more stable part of the continent, though not stable against\r\n  future oscillations of level of _wider range_, nor against denudation.\r\n\r\n  It is apparent that in such a process of formation elevation by direct\r\n  uplift of the underlying crust has no necessary place. The attending\r\n  plications may make elevations on a vast scale and so also may the\r\n  shoves upward along the lines of fracture, and crushing may sometimes\r\n  add to the effect; but elevation from an upward movement of the\r\n  downward bent crust is only an incidental concomitant, if it occur at\r\n  all.\r\n\r\n  We perceive thus where the truth lies in Professor Le Conte’s\r\n  important principle. It should have in view alone _monogenetic_\r\n  mountains and these only _at the time of their making_. It will then\r\n  read, plication and shovings along fractures being made more prominent\r\n  than crushing:\r\n\r\n  Plication, shoving along fractures and crushing are the true sources\r\n  of the elevation that takes place _during the making_ of geosynclinal\r\n  monogenetic mountains.\r\n\r\n  And the statement of Professor Hall may be made right if we recognize\r\n  the same distinction, and, also, reverse the order and causal relation\r\n  of the two events, accumulation and subsidence; and so make it read:\r\n\r\n  Regions of monogenetic mountains were, previous, and preparatory, to\r\n  the making of the mountains, areas each of a slowly progressing\r\n  geosynclinal, and, _consequently_, of thick accumulations of\r\n  sediments.\r\n\r\n  The prominence and importance in orography of the mountain\r\n  individualities described above as originating through a geosynclinal\r\n  make it desirable that they should have a distinctive name; and I\r\n  therefore propose to call a mountain range of this kind a\r\n  _synclinorium_, from _synclinal_ and the Greek ὄρος, mountain.\r\n\r\n  This brings us to another important distinction in orographic\r\n  geology—that of a second kind of monogenetic mountain. The\r\n  _synclinoria_ were _made through a progressing geosynclinal_. Those of\r\n  the second kind, here referred to, were _produced by a progressing\r\n  geanticlinal_. They are simply the upward bendings in the oscillations\r\n  of the earth’s crust—the geanticlinal waves, and hardly require a\r\n  special name. Yet, if one is desired, the term _anticlinorium_, the\r\n  correlate of _synclinorium_, would be appropriate. Many of them have\r\n  disappeared in the course of the oscillations; and yet, some may have\r\n  been for a time—perhaps millions of years—respectable mountains.\r\n\r\n  The geosynclinal ranges or synclinoria have experienced in almost all\r\n  cases, since their completion, true elevation through great\r\n  geanticlinal movements, but movements that embraced a wider range of\r\n  crust than that concerned in the preceding geosynclinal movements,\r\n  indeed a range of crust that comes strictly under the designation of a\r\n  polygenetic mass.”\r\n\r\n\r\n               “_The Condition of the Earth’s Interior._”\r\n\r\n  “The condition of the earth’s interior is not among the geological\r\n  results of contraction from cooling. But these results offer an\r\n  argument of great weight respecting the earth’s interior condition,\r\n  and make it desirable that the subject should be discussed in this\r\n  connection. Moreover, the facts throw additional light on the\r\n  preceding topic—the origin of mountains.\r\n\r\n  It seems now to be demonstrated by astronomical and physical\r\n  arguments—arguments that are independent, it should be noted, of\r\n  direct geological observation—that the interior of our globe is\r\n  essentially solid. But the great oscillations of the earth’s surface,\r\n  which have seemed to demand for explanation a liquid interior, still\r\n  remain facts, and present apparently a greater difficulty than ever to\r\n  the geologist. Professor Le Conte’s views, in volume iv, were offered\r\n  by him as a method of meeting this difficulty; yet, as he admits in\r\n  his concluding remarks, the oscillations over the interior of a\r\n  continent, and the fact of the greater movements on the borders of the\r\n  larger ocean, were left by him unexplained. Yet these oscillations are\r\n  not more real than the changes of level or greater oscillations which\r\n  occurred along the sea border, where mountains were the final result;\r\n  and this being a demonstrated truth, no less than the general solidity\r\n  of the earth’s interior, the question comes up, how are the two truths\r\n  compatible?\r\n\r\n  The geological argument on the subject (the only one within our\r\n  present purpose) has often been presented. But it derives new force\r\n  and gives clearer revelations when the facts are viewed in the light\r\n  of the principles that have been explained in the preceding part of\r\n  this memoir.\r\n\r\n  The Appalachian subsidence in the Alleghany region of 35,000 to 40,000\r\n  feet, going on through all the Paleozoic era, was due, as has been\r\n  shown, to an actual sinking of the earth’s crust through lateral\r\n  pressure, and not to local contraction in the strata themselves or the\r\n  terranes underneath. But such a subsidence is not possible, unless\r\n  seven miles—that is, seven miles in maximum depth and over a hundred\r\n  in total breadth—unless seven miles of _something_ were removed, in\r\n  its progress, from the region beneath.\r\n\r\n  If the matter beneath was not aërial, then liquid or viscous rock was\r\n  pushed aside. This being a fact, it would follow that there existed,\r\n  underneath a crust of unascertained thickness, a sea or lake of mobile\r\n  (viscous or plastic) rock, as large as the sinking region; and also\r\n  that this great viscous sea continued in existence through the whole\r\n  period of subsidence, or, in the case of the Alleghany region, through\r\n  all Paleozoic time—an era estimated on a previous page to cover at\r\n  least thirty-five millions of years, if time since the Silurian age\r\n  began embraced fifty millions of years.\r\n\r\n  The facts thus sustain the statement that lateral pressure produced\r\n  not only the subsidence of the Appalachian region through the\r\n  Paleozoic, but also, cotemporaneously, and as its essential\r\n  prerequisite, the rising of a sea-border elevation, or geanticlinal,\r\n  parallel with it; and that both movements demanded the existence\r\n  beneath of a great sea of mobile rock.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recognition of regional _warping_ as a major factor in the larger\r\nstructure of mountain systems, and the expression of that factor in the\r\nterms geosyncline and geanticline forms a notable advance in geologic\r\nthought. Subsequent folding on a regional scale results in the\r\ndevelopment of synclinoria and anticlinoria. Van Hise has given these\r\nlatter terms wide currency, but apparently inadvertently has used\r\nsynclinorium in a different sense than that in which Dana defined it.\r\nDana gave the word to a mountain range made by the mashing and uplift of\r\na geosyncline, Van Hise defines it as a downfold of a large order of\r\nmagnitude, embracing anticlines and synclines within it; anticlinorium\r\nhe uses for a corresponding up fold.[89] Rice has called attention to\r\nthis change of definition,[90] but Van Hise’s usage is likely to\r\nprevail, since they are needed terms for the larger mountain structure\r\nand do not require a determination of the previous limits of upwarp and\r\ndownwarp,—of original denudation and deposition. Furthermore, a\r\ngeosyncline in mountain folding may have one side uplifted, the other\r\nside depressed and there are reasons for regarding the folds of\r\nPennsylvania, Dana’s type synclinorium, as representing but the western\r\nand downfolded side of the Paleozoic geosyncline. Under that view the\r\nfolded Appalachians of Pennsylvania constitute a synclinorium in both\r\nthe sense of Dana and Van Hise.\r\n\r\n\r\n              _The Ultimate Cause of Crustal Compression._\r\n\r\nThe next important advance in the theory of mountains was made by C. E.\r\nDutton who in 1874 published in the Journal (=8=, 113–123) an article\r\nentitled “A criticism upon the contractional hypothesis.” Dutton gives\r\nreasons for holding that the amount of folding and shortening exhibited\r\nin mountain ranges, especially those of Tertiary date, is very much\r\ngreater in magnitude and is different in nature and distribution from\r\nthat which would be given by the surficial cooling of the globe. The\r\nfollowing quotations cover the principal points in the argument:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The argument for the contractional hypothesis presupposes that the\r\n  earth-mass may be considered as consisting of two portions, a cooled\r\n  exterior of undetermined (though probably comparatively small) depth,\r\n  inclosing a hot nucleus.... The secular loss of heat, it is assumed,\r\n  would be greater from the hot nucleus than from the exterior, and the\r\n  greater consequent contraction of the nucleus would therefore\r\n  gradually withdraw the support of the exterior, which would collapse.\r\n  The resulting strains upon the exterior would be mainly tangential.\r\n  Owing to considerable inequalities in the ability of different\r\n  portions to resist the strains thus developed, the yielding would take\r\n  place at the lines, or regions of least resistance, and the effects of\r\n  the yielding would be manifested chiefly, or wholly, at those places,\r\n  in the form of mountain chains, or belts of table lands, and in the\r\n  disturbances of stratification. The primary division of the surface\r\n  into areas of land and water are attributed to the assumed smaller\r\n  conductivity of materials underlying the land, which have been left\r\n  behind in the general convergence of the surface toward the center.\r\n  Regarding these as the main and underlying premises of the\r\n  contractional argument, it is considered unnecessary to state the\r\n  various subsidiary propositions which have been advanced to explain\r\n  the determination of this action to particular phenomena, since the\r\n  main proposition upon which they are based is considered untenable.\r\n\r\n  There can be no reasonable doubt that the earth-mass consists of a\r\n  cooled exterior inclosing a hot nucleus, and a necessary corollary to\r\n  this must be secular cooling, probably accompanied by contraction of\r\n  the cooling portions. But when we apply the known laws of thermal\r\n  physics to ascertain the rate of this cooling, and its distribution\r\n  through the mass, the objectionable character of the contractional\r\n  hypothesis becomes obvious.\r\n\r\n  That Fourier’s theorem, under the general conditions given, expresses\r\n  the normal law of cooling, is admitted by all mathematicians who have\r\n  examined it. The only ground of controversy must be upon the values to\r\n  be assigned to the constants. But there seem to be no values\r\n  consistent with probability which can be of help to the contractional\r\n  hypothesis. The application of the theorem shows that below 200 or 300\r\n  miles the cooling has, up to the present time, been extremely\r\n  little.... At present, however, the unavoidable deduction from this\r\n  theorem is that the greatest possible contraction due to secular\r\n  cooling is insufficient in amount to account for the phenomena\r\n  attributed to it by the contractional hypothesis.\r\n\r\n  The determination of plications to particular localities presents\r\n  difficulties in the way of the contractional hypothesis which have\r\n  been underrated. It has been assumed that if a contraction of the\r\n  interior were to occur, the yielding of the outer crust would take\r\n  place at localities of least resistance. But this could be true only\r\n  on the assumption that the crust could have a horizontal movement in\r\n  which the nucleus does not necessarily share. A vertical section\r\n  through the Appalachian region and westward to the 100th meridian\r\n  shows a surface highly disturbed for about two hundred and fifty\r\n  miles, and comparatively undisturbed for more than a thousand. No one\r\n  would seriously argue that the contraction of the nucleus had been\r\n  confined to portions underlying the disturbed regions: yet if the\r\n  contraction was general, there must have been a large amount of slip\r\n  of some portion of the undisturbed segment over the nucleus. Such a\r\n  proposition would be very difficult to defend, even if the premises\r\n  were granted. It seems as if the friction and adhesion of the crust\r\n  upon the nucleus had been overlooked. Nor could this be small, even\r\n  though the crust rested upon liquid lava. The attempts which some\r\n  eminent geologists have recently made to explain surface corrugation\r\n  by this method clearly show a neglect on their part to analyze\r\n  carefully the system of forces which a contraction of the nucleus\r\n  would generate in the crust. Their discussions have been argumentative\r\n  and not analytical. The latter method of examination would have shown\r\n  them certain difficulties irreconcilable with their knowledge of\r\n  facts. Adopting the argumentative mode, and in conformity with their\r\n  view regarding the exterior as a shell of insufficient coherence to\r\n  sustain itself when its support is sensibly diminished, the tendency\r\n  of corrugation to occur mainly along certain belts, with series of\r\n  parallel folds, is not explained by assuming that these localities are\r\n  regions of weakness. For a shrinkage of the nucleus would throw each\r\n  elementary portion of the crust into a state of strain by the action\r\n  of forces in all directions within its own tangent plane. A relief by\r\n  a horizontal yielding in one direction would by no means be a general\r\n  relief.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDutton’s criticisms robbed the current hypothesis of mountain-making of\r\nits conventional basis without providing a new foundation. It was a\r\nquarter of a century in advance of its time, has been seldom cited, and\r\nseems to have had but little direct influence in shaping subsequent\r\nthought. It, however, gave direction to Dutton’s views, and his later\r\npapers were far-reaching in their influence.\r\n\r\nIf contraction from external cooling is not the cause of the compressive\r\nforces it is necessary to seek another cause. Two years later, in 1876,\r\nDutton attempted to provide an answer to this open question.[91] A\r\nreview of this paper, evidently by J. D. Dana, is given in the Journal.\r\nThe following explanations of Dutton’s theory and of Dana’s comments\r\nupon it are contained in a few paragraphs from this review (=12=, 142,\r\n1876).\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Captain Dutton presents in this paper the views brought out in his\r\n  article in volume viii of this Journal, with fuller illustrations, and\r\n  adds explanations of his theory of the origin of mountains. The\r\n  discussion should be read by all desiring to reach right conclusions,\r\n  it presenting many arguments from physical considerations against the\r\n  contraction-theory, or that of the uplifting and folding of strata\r\n  through lateral pressure. There is much to be learned before any\r\n  theory of mountain-making shall have a sufficient foundation in\r\n  observed facts to demand full confidence, and Captain Dutton merits\r\n  the thanks of geologists for the aid he has given them toward reaching\r\n  right conclusions. His discussions are not free from misunderstandings\r\n  of geological facts, and if they fail to be finally received it will\r\n  be for this reason.\r\n\r\n  We here give in a brief form, and nearly in his own words, the\r\n  principal points in his theory of mountain-making as explained in the\r\n  later part of his memoir.\r\n\r\n  Accepting the proposition that there is a plastic condition of rock\r\n  beneath the earth’s crust and that metamorphism is a ‘hydrothermal\r\n  process,’ and believing that ‘the penetration of water to profound\r\n  depths [in the earth’s crust] is a well sustained theory,’ he says\r\n  that great pressure and a temperature approaching redness are\r\n  essential conditions of metamorphism.... ‘The heaviest portion would\r\n  sink into the lighter colloid mass underneath, protruding it laterally\r\n  beneath the lighter portions where, by its lighter density, it tends\r\n  to accumulate.’ He adds: ‘The resulting movements would be determined,\r\n  first, by the amount of difference in the densities of the upper and\r\n  lower masses, and, second, by inequalities in the thickness of the\r\n  strata: the forces now become adequate to the building of mountains\r\n  and the plication of strata, and their modes of operation agree with\r\n  the classes of facts already set forth as the concomitants of those\r\n  features.’\r\n\r\n  The views are next applied to a system of plications. ‘It has been\r\n  indicated that plications occur where strata have rapidly accumulated\r\n  in great volume and in elongated narrow belts; that the axes of\r\n  plications are parallel to the axes of maximum deposit; and that the\r\n  movements immediately followed the deposition’—the case of the\r\n  Appalachians being an example in which the accumulations averaged\r\n  40,000 feet. He observes: ‘Wherever the load of sediments becomes\r\n  heaviest, there they sink deepest, protruding the colloid magma\r\n  beneath them to the adjoining areas, which are less heavily weighted,\r\n  forming at once both synclinals and anticlinals.’\r\n\r\n  With regard to this new theory, we might reasonably question the\r\n  existence of the colloid magma—a condition fundamental to the\r\n  theory—and his evidence that water penetrates to profound depths in\r\n  the earth’s crust sufficient to make hydrous rocks. We might ask for\r\n  evidence that the rocks beneath the Cretaceous and Tertiary, and other\r\n  underlying strata of the Uintahs, were in such a colloid state, and\r\n  this so near the surface, that the ‘beds subsided by their gross\r\n  weight as rapidly as they grew.’\r\n\r\n  Again, he says that the movements of mountain-making ‘immediately\r\n  followed the deposition.’ ‘Immediately’ sounds quick to one who\r\n  appreciates the slowness of geological changes. The Carboniferous age\r\n  was very long; and somewhere in that part of geological time, either\r\n  before the age had fully ended, or some time after its close, the\r\n  epoch of catastrophe began.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWe see foreshadowed in this paper the theory of isostasy, or condition\r\nof vertical equilibrium in the crust which Dutton published in 1889.\r\nThis theory has borne remarkable fruit, but Dutton attempted to link to\r\nit the horizontally compressive forces which have produced folding and\r\noverthrusting. Willis in 1907[92] and Hayford in 1911, overlooking\r\nDana’s objections, have attempted to make a lateral isostatic undertow\r\nthe cause of all horizontal movements in the crust, adopting the\r\nmechanism of Dutton. The present writer, although accepting the\r\nprinciple of isostasy as an explanation of broad vertical movements, has\r\npublished papers which go to show the inadequacy of this hypothesis of\r\nlateral pressure; inadequate in time relation, in amount, and in\r\nexpression.[93]\r\n\r\nIn 1903 it was determined by several physicists that the materials of\r\nthe earth’s crust were radioactive and must generate throughout geologic\r\ntime a quantity of heat which perhaps equalled that lost by radiation\r\ninto space. By 1907 this had become demonstrated. The remarkable\r\nconclusion had been reached that the earth, although losing heat, is not\r\na cooling globe. Dutton’s contentions against mountain growth through\r\nexternal cooling and contraction were thus unexpectedly, through a\r\nwholly new branch of knowledge, demonstrated to be true.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, all students of orogeny are agreed that profound\r\ncompressive forces have been the chief agents in developing mountain\r\nstructures. Chamberlin was the first to arrive at the idea that the\r\nshrinkage may originate in the deeper portions of the earth under the\r\nurgency of the enormous pressures, apparently by giving rise to slow\r\nrecombinations of matter into denser forms.[94]\r\n\r\n\r\n      _The New Era in the Interpretation of Mountain Structures._\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, between 1874 and 1904, another advance in the knowledge\r\nof mountain structures was taking place in Europe. Suess studied the\r\ndistribution of mountain arcs over the earth and dwelt upon the\r\nprevalence of overthrust structures; the backland being thrust toward\r\nand over the foreland, the rise of the mountain arc or geanticline\r\ndepressing the foredeep or geosyncline. Bertrand and Lugeon from 1884 to\r\n1900 were reinterpreting the Alpine structures on this basis. They\r\nshowed that the whole mountain system had been overturned and overthrust\r\nfrom the south to an almost incredible degree. Enormous denudation had\r\nlater dissevered the northern outlying portions and given rise to\r\n“mountains without roots,”—isolated outliers, consisting of overturned\r\nmasses of strata which had accumulated as sediments far to the southward\r\nin another portion of the ancient geosyncline.\r\n\r\nOn a smaller scale similar phenomena are exhibited in the Appalachians.\r\nWillis showed that the deep subsidence of the center of the geosyncline\r\ngave an initial dip which determined the position of yielding under\r\ncompression. Laboratory experiments brought out the weakness of the\r\nstratigraphic structure to resist horizontal compression. The nature of\r\nthe stratigraphic series was shown to determine whether the yielding\r\nwould be by mashing, competent folding, or breakage and overthrust. The\r\nproblem of mountain structures was thus brought into the realm of\r\nmechanics. These results were published in three sources in 1893,—the\r\nTransactions of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, the\r\nthirteenth annual report of the United States Geological Survey, and the\r\nJournal (=46=, 257, 1893).\r\n\r\nFinally should be noted the contributions of the Lake Superior school of\r\ngeology, in which the work of Van Hise stands preeminent. Under the\r\neconomic stimulus given by the discovery and development of enormously\r\nrich bodies of iron ore, hidden under Pleistocene drift and involved in\r\nthe complex structures of vanished mountain systems of ancient date,\r\nstructural geology and metamorphism have become exact sciences to be\r\ndrawn upon in the search for mineral wealth and yielding also rich\r\nreturns in a fuller knowledge of early periods of earth history.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _Crust Movements as Revealed by Physiography._\r\n\r\nDuring the last quarter of the nineteenth century another division of\r\ngeology, dominantly American, was taking form and growth,—the science of\r\nland forms,—physiography. The history of that development is treated by\r\nGregory in the preceding chapter but some of its bearings upon theory,\r\nin so far as they affect the subject of mountain origin, are necessarily\r\ngiven here.\r\n\r\nPowell, Dutton, and Gilbert in their explorations of the West saw the\r\nstupendous work of denudation which had been carried to completion again\r\nand again during the progress of geologic time. The mountain relief\r\nconsequently may be much younger than the folding of the rocks, and may\r\nbe largely or even wholly due to recurrent plateau movement, a doctrine\r\nto which Dana had previously arrived. But the introduction of the idea\r\nof the peneplain opened up a new field for exploration in the nature and\r\ndate of crust movements. Davis by this means began to study the later\r\nchapters of Appalachian history, the most important early paper being\r\npublished in 1891.[95] Since then Davis, Willis, and many others have\r\nfound that, girdling the world, a large part of the mountainous relief\r\nis due to vertical elevatory forces acting over regions of previous\r\nfolding and overthrust. In addition, great plateau areas of unfolded\r\nrocks have been bodily lifted one to two miles, or more, above their\r\nearlier levels. They may be broad geanticlinal arches or bounded by the\r\nwalls of profound fractures.\r\n\r\nThe linear mountain systems made from deep troughs of sediments have\r\ncome then to be recognized as but one of several classes of mountains.\r\nThis class, from its clear development in the Appalachians, and the fact\r\nthat many of the laws of mountain structure pertaining to it were first\r\nworked out there, has been called by Powell the Appalachian type (=12=,\r\n414, 1876). A classification of mountain systems was proposed by him in\r\nwhich mountains are classified into two major divisions, those composed\r\nof sedimentary strata altered or unaltered, and those composed in whole\r\nor in part of extravasated material. The first class he subdivides into\r\nsix sub-classes of which the folded Appalachians illustrate one. It\r\nappears to the writer that Powell’s classification gives\r\ndisproportionate importance to certain types which he described; but\r\nnevertheless, the fact that such a classification was made, indicates\r\nthe growth of a more comprehensive knowledge of mountains,—their origin,\r\nstructure, and history.\r\n\r\n\r\n       _Relations of Crust Movements to Density and Equilibrium._\r\n\r\nA recent important development in the fields of geophysics and major\r\ncrust movements consists in the incorporation into geology of the\r\ndoctrine of isostasy. The evidence was developed in the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century by the geodetic survey of India which indicated that\r\nthe Himalayas did not exert the gravitative influence that their volume\r\ncalled for. It was clear that the crust beneath that mountain system was\r\nless dense than beneath the plains of India and still less dense than\r\nthe crust beneath the Indian Ocean. This relation between density and\r\nelevation indicated some approach to flotational equilibrium in the\r\ncrust, comparable in its nature though not in delicacy of adjustment to\r\nthe elevation of the surface of an iceberg above the ocean level owing\r\nto its depth and its density, less than that of the surrounding medium.\r\nThis important geological conception was kept within the confines of\r\nastronomy and geodesy, however, until Dutton in 1876, but especially in\r\n1889, brought it into the geologic field. A test of isostasy was made\r\nfor the United States by Putnam and Gilbert in 1895 and much more\r\nelaborate investigations have since been made by Hayford and Bowie.\r\nThese investigations demonstrate the importance and reality of broad\r\nwarping forces acting vertically and related to the regional variations\r\nof density in the crust.\r\n\r\nThere are consequently two major and unrelated classes of forces\r\ninvolved in the making of mountain structures,—the irresistible\r\nhorizontal compressive forces, arising apparently from condensation deep\r\nwithin the earth, and vertical forces originating in the outer envelopes\r\nand tending toward a hydrostatic equilibrium. In this latter field of\r\ninvestigation, America, since the initial paper by Dutton, has taken the\r\nlead.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Conclusion on Contributions of America to Theories of Orogeny._\r\n\r\nThe sciences arose in Europe, but those which treated of the earth were\r\nstill in their infancy when transplanted to America. The first\r\ncomprehensive ideas on the nature of mountain structures arose in Great\r\nBritain and France. These ideas served as a guide and stimulus to\r\nobservation in the recognition of deformations in the strata of the\r\nAppalachian system. Since 1840, however, America has ceased to be a\r\npupil in this field of research but has joined as an equal with the two\r\nolder countries. New ideas have been contributed, new and striking\r\nillustrations cited, first by the scientists of one nation, next by\r\nthose of another. The composite mass of knowledge has grown as a common\r\npossession. Nevertheless, a review of the progress since 1840 as\r\nmeasured by the contribution of new ideas shows on the whole America at\r\nleast equal to its intellectual rivals, and at certain times actually\r\nthe leader. This is true of the science of geology as a whole and also\r\nof the subdivision of orogeny.\r\n\r\nThus far no mention has been made of German geologists, with the\r\nexception of Suess, an Austrian. German geology is voluminous and the\r\nnames of many well-known geologists could be cited. But this article has\r\nsought to trace the origin and growth of fundamental ideas. The Germans\r\nhave been assiduous observers of detail; preeminent as systematizers and\r\nclassifiers, seldom originators. Even petrology, which might be regarded\r\nas their especial field, was transplanted from Great Britain. In the\r\nscience of mountains they have followed in their fundamental ideas\r\nespecially the French.\r\n\r\nTurning to the mediums of publication through which this progress of\r\nknowledge in earth structures has been recorded, the American Journal of\r\nScience stands foremost as the only continuous record for the whole\r\ncentury in American literature, fulfilling for this country what the\r\nQuarterly Journal of the Geological Society has done for Great Britain\r\nsince 1845, and the Bulletin de la Société Géologique for France since\r\n1830.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _Notes._\r\n\r\nFootnote 78:\r\n\r\n  H.

Therefore a review of the\r\ncountry’s record of surveys under Government auspices becomes more than\r\na grateful acknowledgment by the present generation of geologists of the\r\ncredit due to those who blazed the way; it shows the sequence and\r\nprogress in the contributions made by geologic science to industry.\r\n\r\nThe earlier stages in industrial evolution mentioned by\r\nHess[96]—exploitation, development, and maturity—determine a somewhat\r\nsimilar progressive development in geologic investigation, so that\r\ngeographic exploration and geologic reconnaissance of the broadest type\r\nare the normal contribution of exact science whenever and wherever a\r\nnation is in the state of exploitation and initial development of its\r\nmineral and agricultural resources. The refinements of detailed surveys\r\nand quantitative examinations belong rather to the next stage of\r\nintensive utilization, or, indeed, they are the essentials preliminary\r\nto full use. Thus regrets that the results of present-day work were not\r\navailable fifty years ago are largely vain: the fathers may not have\r\nbeen without the vision; they simply did the work as their day and\r\ngeneration needed it done.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago S. F. Emmons, in a presidential address before the\r\nGeological Society of Washington, divided the history of Governmental\r\nsurveys in this country into two periods, separated in a general way by\r\nthe Civil War. The first of these was the period of geographic\r\nexploration, the second that of geologic exploration. Mr. Emmons of\r\ncourse regarded this subdivision as not hard and fast, yet his dividing\r\nline seems logical, for not only did the military activities in the East\r\nnecessarily suspend exploration in the West, but after the war national,\r\npolitical, and economic considerations led naturally to the demand for a\r\nmore exact knowledge of the vast national domain in the West. Geography\r\nand geology are so closely related that Mr. Emmons’s distinction of the\r\ntwo periods is useful only with the limitations inferentially set by\r\nhimself—namely, that while geologic investigation entered into most of\r\nthe explorations of the earlier period, the geologist was regarded as\r\nonly an accessory in these exploring expeditions; on the other hand, in\r\nthe later surveys the topographic work was developed because it was\r\nessential to the geologic investigations.\r\n\r\nThe year 1818 was a notable one in American geology, first of all in the\r\nappearance of the American Journal of Science, itself so perfect a\r\nvehicle for geological thought that, as is so well stated by Dr. G. P.\r\nMerrill, “a perusal of the numbers from the date of issue down to the\r\npresent time will alone afford a fair idea of the gradual progress of\r\nAmerican geology.” The beginning of publications on New England geology\r\nappeared that year in Edward Hitchcock’s first paper on the Connecticut\r\nValley (1, 105, 1818) and the Danas’ (S. L. and J. F.) detailed geologic\r\nand mineralogic description of Boston and vicinity; and the “Index” of\r\nAmos Eaton (noticed in this Journal, =1=, 69) was the first of that long\r\nlist of notable contributions to American stratigraphy that are to be\r\ncredited to the New York geologists.\r\n\r\nIn the present discussion, too, the year 1918 can be regarded as in a\r\nway the centennial of Government geologic surveys, for it was in 1818\r\nthat Henry R. Schoolcraft began his trip to the Mississippi\r\nValley—perhaps the first geologic reconnaissance into the West—and it\r\nwas his work in the lead region which served to make him a member of the\r\nCass expedition sent out by the Secretary of War in 1820 to examine the\r\nmetallic wealth of the Lake Superior region. The earlier Government\r\nexplorations of Lewis and Clark, in 1803–7, and of Pike, in 1805–7, were\r\nso exclusively geographic that geologic work under Federal auspices must\r\nbe regarded as beginning with Schoolcraft and with Edwin James, the\r\ngeologist of the expedition of Major Long in 1819–20 to the Rocky\r\nMountains. Both these observers published reports that are valuable as\r\ncontributions to the knowledge of littleknown regions.\r\n\r\nAny description of geologic work under the Federal Government that\r\nincluded no reference to the State surveys would be inadequate, for in\r\nboth date of execution and stage of development the work of the State\r\ngeologists must be given precedence. In Merrill’s Contributions to the\r\nHistory of American Geology,[97] whose modest title fails even to\r\nsuggest that this work not only furnishes the most useful chronologic\r\nrecord of the progress of the science on the American continent but is\r\nin fact a very thesaurus of incidents touching the personal side of\r\ngeology, the author by his division of his subject shows that four\r\ndecades of the era of State surveys elapsed before the era of national\r\nsurveys began.\r\n\r\nThus the geologic surveys of some of the Eastern States antedate by\r\nseveral decades any Federal organization of comparable geologic scope,\r\nand in investigations directed to local utilitarian problems these\r\npioneer geologists working in the older settled States of the East were\r\nin fact already conducting work as detailed in type as much of that\r\nattempted by the Federal geologists of the later period. Even to-day it\r\nis true in a general way that the State geologist can and should attack\r\nmany of his local problems with intensive methods and with detail of\r\nresults that are neither practicable nor desirable for the larger\r\ninterstate investigations or for examinations in newer territory. All\r\nthis relation of State and Federal work must be looked upon as normal\r\nevolutionary development of geologic science in America.\r\n\r\nOne who reads the names of the Federal geologists of the early days,\r\nbeginning with Jackson and Owen and following with such leaders in\r\nFederal work as Gilbert, Chamberlin, King, R. D. Irving, Pumpelly, Van\r\nHise, and Walcott, may note that these were all connected in their\r\nearlier work with State surveys. Nor has the relation been one-sided,\r\nfor among the State geologists Whitney, Blake, Mather, Newberry, J. G.\r\nNorwood, Purdue, Bain, Gregory, Ashley, Kirk, W. H. Emmons, DeWolf,\r\nMathews, Brown, Landes, Moore, and Crider received their field training\r\nin part or wholly as members of a Federal Survey. Moreover, under the\r\npresent plan of effective cooperation of several of the State surveys\r\nwith the United States Geological Survey, it is often difficult to\r\ndifferentiate between the two in either personnel or results, for it\r\neven happens that the publishing organization may not have been the\r\nmajor contributor. The full record of American geology, past and\r\npresent, can not be set forth in terms of Federal auspices alone.\r\n\r\nThe three decades preceding the Civil War, then, constitute the era of\r\nState surveys, well described by Merrill as at first characterized by a\r\ncontagious enthusiasm for beginning geologic work, later by a more\r\nnormal condition in which every available geologist seems to have been\r\nquietly at work, and finally by renewed activity in creating new\r\norganizations. The net result was that Louisiana and Oregon seem to have\r\nbeen the only States not having at least one geological survey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  From “Contributions to the History of American Geology”\r\n  by George P. Merrills.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe first specific appropriation by the Federal Government for geologic\r\ninvestigation appears to have been made in 1834, when a supplemental\r\nappropriation for surveys of roads and canals under the War Department,\r\nauthorized in 1824, contained the item “of which sum five thousand\r\ndollars shall be appropriated and applied to geological and\r\nmineralogical survey and researches.” In July, 1834, Mr. G. W.\r\nFeatherstonhaugh was appointed United States geologist and employed\r\nunder Colonel Abert, U. S. Topographical Engineers, to “personally\r\ninspect the mineral and geological character” of the public lands of the\r\nOzark Mountain region. Overlooking the incidental fact that this\r\nEnglishman—a man of scientific attainment and large interest in public\r\naffairs—was never naturalized,[98] it must be placed to the credit of\r\nthis first of United States geologists that within seven months he\r\ncompleted his field work and returned to Washington, and on February 17,\r\n1835, his report was transmitted to Congress. Two years earlier\r\nFeatherstonhaugh had memorialized Congress for aid in the preparation of\r\na geologic map of the whole territory of the United States, and in\r\nconnection with this project he suggested that geology as an aid to\r\nmilitary engineering should have a place in the curriculum at West\r\nPoint. This first United States geologist also appears to have combined\r\nan appreciation of the practical worth of “the mineral riches of our\r\ncountry, their quality, quantity, and the facility of procuring them,”\r\nwith an interest in the more scientific side of geology, though his\r\nhypotheses regarding both economic geology and stratigraphic and\r\nstructural geology have not won the endorsement of all later workers in\r\nthe same regions. In all these respects, however, Featherstonhaugh may\r\nstand as a fairly good prototype. His contributions to international\r\naffairs subsequent to his scientific service to the United States are of\r\ninterest; he served as one of Her Majesty’s commissioners in the\r\nsettlement of the Canadian-United States boundary question in 1839–40\r\nand made an examination of the disputed area, and after the settlement\r\nof this controversy he was appointed British Consul for the Department\r\nof the Seine, France, where in 1848 he personally engineered the escape\r\nof Louis Philippe from Havre.\r\n\r\nThe Federal geologic work thus started was soon continued in surveys of\r\nwider scope and more thorough accomplishment. The position of the\r\nGovernment as the proprietor of mineral lands in the Upper Mississippi\r\nValley led to their examination. These Government lands containing lead\r\nhad been reserved from sale for lease since 1807, although no leases\r\nwere issued until 1822. The amount of illegal entry and consequent\r\nrefusal of smelters and miners to pay royalty after 1834 forced the\r\nissue upon the attention of Congress, and in 1839 President Van Buren\r\nwas requested to present to Congress a plan for the sale of the public\r\nmineral lands. In carrying out this policy Dr. David Dale Owen was\r\nselected to make the necessary survey.\r\n\r\nOwen had served as an assistant on the State Survey of Tennessee and as\r\nthe first State geologist of Indiana, and he organized the new work\r\npromptly and effectively. Although suffering from the handicap\r\nunfortunately known by geologists of the present day—the receipt late in\r\nthe season (August 17, 1839) of authority to begin work—within exactly a\r\nmonth he had his force of 139 assistants organized into 24 field\r\nparties, instructed in “such elementary principles of geology as were\r\nnecessary to their performance of the duties required of them.” His plan\r\nof campaign provided for a northward drive at a predetermined rate of\r\ntraverse for each party, with periodic reports to himself at appointed\r\nstations, “to receive which reports and to examine the country in\r\nperson” he crossed the area under survey eleven times. The result of\r\nsuch masterful leadership was the completion of the exploration of all\r\nthe lands comprehended in his orders in two months and six days, and his\r\nreport on this great area—about 11,000 square miles—bears date of April\r\n2, 1840.\r\n\r\nEight years later Doctor Owen made a survey of an even larger area,\r\ncontinuing his examination northward to Lake Superior. Again his report\r\nwas published promptly, and he continued for several years his\r\nexamination of the Northwest Territory, submitting his final report in\r\n1851. It is interesting to note that in his earlier report Doctor Owen\r\nsubscribed himself as “Principal Agent to explore the Mineral Lands of\r\nthe United States,” but that in the later report he was “U. S. Geologist\r\nfor Wisconsin.” The two surveys together covered 57,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nDuring the same period similar surveys were being made in northern\r\nMichigan by Dr. Charles T. Jackson, 1847–48, and Foster and Whitney,\r\n1849–51. These surveys also had been hastened by the “copper fever” of\r\n1844–46, with wholesale issue of permits and leases, Congress in 1847\r\nauthorizing the sale of the mineral lands and a geological survey of the\r\nLake Superior district. The execution of these surveys under Jackson and\r\nunder Foster and Whitney and the prompt publication in 1851 of the maps\r\nof the whole region materially helped to establish copper mining on a\r\nmore conservative basis. and the development of the Lake Superior region\r\nwas rapid.[99]\r\n\r\nThese land-classification surveys, with their definite purpose,\r\nrepresent the best geologic work of the time. The plan necessitated\r\nthoroughgoing field work with considerable detail and prompt publication\r\nof systematic reports, and in the working up of the results specialists\r\nlike James Hall and Joseph Leidy contributed, while F. B. Meek was an\r\nassistant of Owen. It is worthy of note that had not Doctor Houghton,\r\nthe State geologist of Michigan, met an untimely death in 1847,\r\neffective cooperation of the State Survey with the Federal officials\r\nwould have combined geologic investigation with the execution of the\r\nlinear surveys.[100]\r\n\r\nBelonging to the same period of geologic exploration was the service of\r\nJ. D. Dana, as United States Geologist on the Wilkes Exploring\r\nExpedition, the disaster to which compelled his return from the Pacific\r\nCoast overland and resulted in his geologic observations on Oregon and\r\nnorthern California.\r\n\r\nThe military expeditions during the decade 1850–60 and the earlier\r\nexpeditions of Fremont added to the geographic knowledge of the Western\r\ncountry and also contributed to geologic science, largely through\r\ncollections of rocks and fossils, usually reported on by the specialists\r\nof the day. Thus the names of Hall, Conrad, Hitchcock, and Meek appear\r\nin the published reports on these explorations, while Marcou, Blake,\r\nNewberry, Gibbs, Evans, Hayden, Parry, Shumard, Schiel, Antisell, and\r\nEngelmann were geologists attached to the field expeditions. In 1852\r\ngeologic investigation was seemingly so popular as to necessitate the\r\nstatutory prohibition “there shall be no further geological survey by\r\nthe Government unless hereafter authorized by law.”\r\n\r\nCertain of these explorations had a specific purpose: several of them\r\nsought a practical route for a transcontinental railroad; another a new\r\nwagon road across Utah and Nevada; and one under Colonel Pope, with G.\r\nG. Shumard as geologist, was sent out “for boring Artesian Wells along\r\nthe line of the 32d Parallel” in New Mexico. The published reports\r\nvaried greatly in scientific value and in carefulness of preparation,\r\nwhile the publication of at least two reports was delayed until long\r\nafter the war, and the manuscript of another was lost. The report of the\r\nexpedition of Major Emory contained a colored geologic map of the\r\nwestern half of the country, a pioneer publication, for the map prepared\r\nby Marcou extended only to the 106th meridian.\r\n\r\nThus in the first period of Government surveys, covering about forty\r\nyears, the great West, with its wealth of public lands, was well\r\ntraversed by exploratory surveys, which furnished, however, only general\r\noutlines for a comprehension of the stratigraphy and structure of\r\nmountain and valley, plain and plateau. To an even less degree was there\r\nany realization of the economic possibilities of the vast territory west\r\nof the Mississippi. President Jefferson, in planning the Lewis and Clark\r\nexpedition, had stated his special interest in the mineral resources of\r\nthe region to be traversed. Nearly forty years later Doctor Owen was\r\nstrongly impressed with the commercial promise of the region he\r\nsurveyed. His reports contain analyses of ores and statistics of\r\nproduction; he compared the lead output of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Illinois\r\nwith that of Europe and foretold the value of the iron, copper, and zinc\r\ndeposits of the area; he outlined the extent of the Illinois coal field;\r\nand he laid equal emphasis upon the agricultural possibilities of the\r\nregion. Indeed, so optimistic were Owen’s general conclusions that he\r\nreferred to his separate township plats, with their detailed\r\ndescriptions, as the basis for his sanguine opinions, realizing that\r\n“the explorer is apt to become the special pleader.” With equal breadth\r\nof view and thoroughness of execution the surveys of Foster and Whitney\r\nlaid the foundation for the development of the copper and iron resources\r\nof the Lake Superior region, and although these areas were largely\r\nwilderness and not adapted to rapid traverse or easy observation the\r\nreports on their explorations nevertheless compare most favorably with\r\nthe contributions of geologists working in the more hospitable regions\r\nin the older States.\r\n\r\nThe period following the Civil War naturally became one of national\r\nexpansion, the faces of many were turned westward, and exploration of\r\nthe national domain for its industrial possibilities took on fresh\r\ninterest. Home-seekers and miners largely made up this army of peaceful\r\ninvasion, and the winning of the West began on a scale quite different\r\nfrom that of the days of the military path-finding expeditions of\r\nFremont and other Army officers. Thus the nation was aroused to the task\r\nof investigating its public lands and Congress gave the support needed\r\nto make geologic exploration possible on a large scale.\r\n\r\nGeologic surveys of a high order were continued in the older States, as\r\nshown by the contributions during this period of J. P. Lesley and G. H.\r\nCook in the East, W. C. Kerr, E. W. Hilgard, and E. A. Smith in the\r\nSouth, and J. S. Newberry, C. A. White, Raphael Pumpelly, T. C.\r\nChamberlin, Alexander Winchell, and T. B. Brooks in the Central States.\r\nTo the north the Canadian Survey, organized in 1841 under Logan, had\r\ncontinued under the same sturdy leadership until 1869, when the\r\nexperienced and talented Doctor Selwyn became Director. As contrasted\r\nwith the short careers of most of the State Surveys and with the\r\ntemporary character of all of the Federal undertakings in geologic\r\ninvestigation, the continuance of the Canadian Geological Survey for\r\nmore than half a century under two directors gave opportunity for\r\ncontinuity of effort in making known to the people of the Dominion its\r\nresources and at the same time contributing to the world much pure\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nPassing with simple mention the two Government expeditions into the\r\nBlack Hills, which afforded opportunity for geologic exploration by N.\r\nH. Winchell in 1874 and by Jenney and Newton in 1875, the record of\r\ngeologic work under Government auspices in the period immediately\r\nfollowing the Civil War groups itself around the names of four\r\nleaders—Hayden, King, Powell, and Wheeler. The four organizations,\r\ndistinguished commonly by the names of these four masterful organizers,\r\noccupied the Western field more or less continuously from 1867 to 1878,\r\nand the sum total of their contributions to geography and geology was\r\nlarge indeed. In the words of Clarence King,[101] “Eighteen hundred and\r\nsixty-seven, therefore, marks, in the history of national geological\r\nwork, a turning point, when the science ceased to be dragged in the dust\r\nof rapid exploration and took a commanding position in the professional\r\nwork of the country.” Together these four expeditions covered half a\r\nmillion square miles, or more than a third of the area of the United\r\nStates west of the one-hundredth meridian, and the cost of all this work\r\nwas approximately two million dollars, which was a small fraction of its\r\nvalue to the nation counting only the impetus given to settlement and\r\nutilization.\r\n\r\nAs viewed from a distance of nearly half a century, these four surveys\r\ndiffered much in plan of organization, scope of purpose, and success of\r\nexecution, so that comparison would have little value except as possibly\r\nbearing upon the work of the larger organization which followed them and\r\nbecame the heir not only to much that had been attained by these pioneer\r\nsurveys but also to the great task uncompleted by them. So, if in the\r\nearliest days of the present United States Geological Survey there may\r\nhave been a certain partisanship in tracing derived characters in the\r\nnew organization, it is even now worth while to recognize the real\r\norigin of much that is credited to present-day development.\r\n\r\nDr. F. V. Hayden was the first of these Survey leaders to engage in\r\ngeological exploration. He visited the Badlands as early as 1853, and\r\nhis connection with subsequent expeditions was interrupted only by his\r\nservice as a surgeon in the Federal Army during the war. In 1867,\r\nhowever, Hayden resumed his geologic work as United States Geologist\r\nin Nebraska, operating under direction of the Commissioner of the\r\nGeneral Land Office. In the following eleven years the activities of\r\nthe Hayden Survey—the “Geological and Geographical Survey of the\r\nTerritories”—extended into Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Montana, and\r\nIdaho, covering with areal surveys 107,000 square miles. This Survey,\r\nas might be expected from the long experience of its leader, made\r\nlarge contributions to stratigraphy, which involved notable\r\npaleontologic work by Cope, Meek, and Lesquereux. Next in importance\r\nwas the structural work of A. C. Peale, W. H. Holmes, Capt. C. E.\r\nDutton, and Dr. Hayden himself, and the influence of these expeditions\r\nin popularizing geology should not be overlooked. The expedition of\r\n1871 into the geyser region on the upper Yellowstone resulted in the\r\ncreation of the first of the national parks. W. H. Holmes began his\r\nartistic contributions to geology in 1872 with this Survey.\r\nTopographic mapping was added to the geologic exploration, James T.\r\nGardner and A. D. Wilson joining the Hayden Survey after earlier\r\nservice on the King Survey and Henry Gannett being a member of\r\nparties, first as astronomer and later as topographer in charge. The\r\naccomplishment of the Hayden Survey itself and the later work of many\r\nof its members show that this organization possessed a corps of strong\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe King Survey was a smaller organization, with Congressional\r\nauthorization of definite scope and a systematic plan of operation. The\r\nbeginning of construction of the Union Pacific terminated the period of\r\nthe railroad surveys under the War Department and afforded opportunity\r\nfor geologic work that would be more than exploratory: the opening up of\r\nthe new country made investigation of its resources logical. This fact\r\nwas recognized by Clarence King, who had traversed the same route as a\r\nmember of an emigrant train with his friend James T. Gardner. His plan\r\nto make a geological cross section of the Cordilleras, with a study of\r\nthe resources along the route of the Pacific railroads, won the support\r\nof Congress, and the “Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel”\r\nwas authorized in 1867, with Clarence King as geologist in charge, under\r\nthe Chief of Engineers of the Army. Field work was begun in the summer\r\nof that year, and it is interesting to note that Mr. King and his small\r\nforce of geological assistants—the two Hagues and S. F. Emmons—began at\r\nthe western end of this cross section, and in this and subsequent years\r\nextended the survey from the east front of the Sierra Nevada to\r\nCheyenne, covering a belt of territory about 100 miles in width. This\r\ncomprehensive plan was carried out in the field operations, and the\r\nscientific and economic results were systematically worked up in the\r\nreports, which appeared in 1870–80. The only departure from this plan\r\nwas a study of the volcanic mountains Shasta, Rainier, and Hood, in\r\n1870, occasioned by an unexpected and unsolicited appropriation for\r\nfield work, and that summer’s work resulted in the discovery of active\r\nglaciers, the first known within the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Fortieth Parallel Survey is to be credited with contributions to the\r\nknowledge of the stratigraphy of the West, the region traversed being\r\nremarkably representative of the stratigraphic column, to which was\r\nadded the paleontologic work of Marsh, Meek, Hall, and Whitfield, while\r\nthe attempt was made to interpret the sedimentary record in terms of\r\nPaleozoic, Mesozoic, and Tertiary geography. King’s plan of survey\r\nincluded large use of topographic mapping with astronomic base and\r\ntriangulation control and contours based upon barometric elevations. The\r\nresults were pronounced by an unfriendly critic[102] as “very valuable,\r\nespecially from a geological point of view,” but unfortunate in being\r\nthe forerunner of work in which Government geologists “have presumed to\r\narrogate the control of the fundamental operations of a topographic\r\nsurvey.” To the King Survey must be credited the introduction of\r\nsystematic contour mapping and the use of contour maps for purposes of\r\ngeology. In two other respects the King Survey contributed largely to\r\nfuture Government work: microscopical petrography in the United States\r\nmay be said to have begun with the visit of Professor Zirkel to this\r\ncountry as a member of this Survey in 1875, and the report of J. D.\r\nHague on “Mining Industry” was the fitting expression of the emphasis\r\nthen put on the study of the mineral resources of this newly opened\r\nterritory, a subject of investigation that was in large part the true\r\nbasis of King’s project rather than simply “the immediate excuse for the\r\nSurvey.” An earlier influence in the scientific study of ore deposits\r\nhad come from Von Richthofen’s investigation of the Comstock Lode in\r\n1865 and his subsequent work with Whitney in California. The incident of\r\nKing’s relation to the diamond fraud in Arizona in 1872 furnished a\r\nprecedent for public servants of a later day; he investigated the\r\nreported find from scientific interest but exposed it with all the zeal\r\nof a publicist and truth lover. In a word, the Fortieth Parallel Survey\r\ncommands our admiration for its brilliant plan, thoroughgoing work in\r\nfield and office, and high quality of personnel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. W. Powell]\r\n\r\nMajor J. W. Powell began his large contribution to Government surveys\r\nwith his exploration of the Grand Canyon in 1869, the Congressional\r\nrecognition of his expedition being limited to an authorization for the\r\nissue of rations by the War Department. Small appropriations were made\r\nin the following years, and in 1874 full authorization was given for the\r\ncontinuance of his survey in Utah under the Secretary of the Interior\r\nand was followed by the adoption of the name “United States Geographical\r\nand Geological Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region.” This organization\r\nwas the least pretentious of the four operating during this period—it\r\ncovered less area, expended less public money, and published much\r\nless—but its contribution to American geology is not to be measured by\r\nmiles or pages but by ideas. Its physical environment favored this\r\nsurvey, and in the work of Powell, Dutton, and Gilbert can be seen the\r\nbeginnings of physiography on the heroic scale exemplified in the Grand\r\nCanyon and the High Plateaus. The first use of terms like “base-level of\r\nerosion,” “consequent and antecedent drainage,” and “laccolith” marked\r\nthe introduction of new ideas in the interpretation of land sculpture\r\nand geologic structure. The daring boat trip of Powell was no less\r\nbrilliant than his simple explanation of the Grand Canyon itself.\r\n\r\n“The United States Geographical Surveys West of the 100th Meridian” was\r\nthe title given to the explorations made under Lieut. G. M. Wheeler, of\r\nthe Engineer Corps, which began with topographic reconnaissances in\r\nNevada, Utah, and Arizona, specifically authorized by Congress in 1872.\r\nFrom the standpoint of American geology this could be better known as\r\nthe Gilbert Survey, Mr. G. K. Gilbert serving for the three years\r\n1871–73, the later part of the time with the title of chief geological\r\nassistant. Gilbert’s contributions included his description of Basin\r\nRange structure, his first account of old Lake Bonneville, and his\r\ndiscussion of the erosion phenomena of the desert country. J. J.\r\nStevenson also served later as a geologist of this Survey, and A. R.\r\nMarvine, E. E. Howell, E. D. Cope, Jules Marcou, and I. C. Russell were\r\nconnected with the field parties. Captain Wheeler’s own claim for the\r\nwork of his Survey emphasized its geographic side, for he regarded the\r\nresults as the partial completion of a systematic topographic survey of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nBy 1878, when the Fortieth Parallel Survey had completed the work\r\nplanned by its chief, three of these independent surveys still contended\r\nfor Federal support and for scientific occupation of the most attractive\r\nportions of the Western country. Unrestrained competition of this kind,\r\neven in the public service, proves as wasteful as unregulated\r\ncompetition in private business,[103] and Congress appealed to the\r\nNational Academy of Sciences for a plan for Government surveys to\r\n“secure the best results at the least possible cost.” Under instructions\r\nby Congress the National Academy considered all the work relating to\r\nscientific surveys and reported to Congress a plan prepared by a special\r\ncommittee, whose membership included the illustrious names of Marsh,\r\nDana, Rogers, Newberry, Trowbridge, Newcomb, and Agassiz. This report,\r\nwhich was adopted by the Academy with only one dissenting vote, grouped\r\nall surveys—geodetic, topographic, land parceling, and economic—under\r\ntwo distinct heads, surveys of mensuration and surveys of geology. At\r\nthat time five independent organizations in three different departments\r\nwere carrying on surveys of mensuration, and the Academy recommended\r\nthat all such work be combined under the Coast and Geodetic Survey with\r\nthe new name Coast and Interior Survey. For the investigation of the\r\nnatural resources of the public domain and the classification of the\r\npublic lands a new organization was proposed, the United States\r\nGeological Survey. The functions of these two surveys and of a third\r\ncoordinate bureau in the Interior Department, the Land Office, were\r\ncarefully defined and their interrelations fully recognized and provided\r\nfor in the plan presented to Congress. Viewed in the light of 39 years\r\nof experience the National Academy plan would be indorsed by most of us\r\nas eminently practical, and the report stands as a splendid example of\r\npublic service rendered by America’s leading scientists. The legislation\r\nwhich embodied the entire plan, however, failed of passage in Congress.\r\n\r\nThe natural activity behind the scenes of the conflicting interests\r\nrepresented by those connected with the several surveys may be seen in\r\nthe legislative history of the moves leading up to the creation of the\r\nUnited States Geological Survey. In the last session of the 45th\r\nCongress the special legislation embodying the recommendations of the\r\nNational Academy was included in the Legislative, Executive, and\r\nJudicial Appropriation bill as it passed the House of Representatives,\r\nwhile the Sundry Civil Appropriation bill carried an item simply making\r\neffective the longer section in the other appropriation bill. The item\r\nin the Legislative appropriation bill created the office of the Director\r\nof the Geological Survey, provided his salary, and defined his duties,\r\nas well as specifically terminating the operations of the three older\r\norganizations. The item in the Sundry Civil bill as it passed the House\r\nappropriated $100,000 for the new Geological Survey, but when this\r\nappropriation bill was reported to the Senate a committee amendment\r\nadded the words “of the Territories,” and further amendments offered on\r\nthe floor changed the item so as to provide specifically and exclusively\r\nfor the continuation of the Hayden Survey. Other amendments provided\r\nsmall appropriations for the completion of the reports of the Powell and\r\nWheeler surveys, and the bill passed the Senate in this form. The\r\nLegislative Appropriation bill was similarly pruned, while in the\r\nSenate, of all reference to the proposed new organization. This bill,\r\nhowever, died in conference, but in the last hours of the session the\r\nconferees on the Sundry Civil bill took unto themselves legislative\r\npowers and transferred from the dead bill to the pending measure all the\r\nlanguage which constitutes the “organic act” of the United States\r\nGeological Survey. This action was denounced in the Senate as “a wide\r\ndeparture from the authority that is possessed by a conference\r\ncommittee,” and it was further stated in debate that the inserted\r\nprovision which created a new office and discontinued the existing\r\nsurveys was one “which neither the Committee of the Senate nor the\r\nSenate itself ever saw.” This assertion was perhaps parliamentarily\r\nsound in that the language was new to the Sundry Civil bill, yet\r\nactually the Senate had only two days before stricken the same proposed\r\nlegislation from the pending Legislative Appropriation bill. However,\r\nthe House conferees—Representatives Atkins of Tennessee, Hewett of New\r\nYork, and Hale of Maine—had realized their tactical advantage, and the\r\nSenate, after a brief debate, voted on March 3 to concur in the report\r\nof the committee of conference, thus reversing all their earlier action,\r\nin which the friends of the Hayden and Wheeler organizations apparently\r\nhad commanded more votes than the advocates of the National Academy\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nClarence King was appointed first Director of the United States\r\nGeological Survey on April 3, 1879, and began the work of organization.\r\nWith his proven genius for administration, King promptly resolved the\r\ndoubt as to the meaning of the term “national domain” in the language\r\ndefining the duties of the Director by taking the conservative side and\r\nlimiting the work of the new organization to the region west of the 102d\r\nmeridian. This region was divided into four geological divisions, and\r\nfor economy of time and money field headquarters were established for\r\nthese divisions. The Division of the Rocky Mountains was placed under\r\nMr. Emmons as geologist in charge, the Division of the Colorado under\r\nCaptain Dutton, the Division of the Great Basin under Mr. Gilbert, and\r\nthe Division of the Pacific under Arnold Hague. The Division of the\r\nColorado was intended as merely temporary for the purpose of bringing to\r\ncompletion the scientific work of the Powell Survey. Similarly Dr.\r\nHayden was given the opportunity to prepare a systematic digest of his\r\nscientific results. This organization of the work and the selection of\r\ngeologists in charge showed the relation of the new and the old, and a\r\nglance at the personnel of the new Survey indicates the extent to which\r\nthe geologic investigation of the Western country was to continue\r\nwithout interruption. Of the twenty-four geologists and topographers\r\nlisted in the first administrative report, four had been connected with\r\nthe Powell Survey, two with the Hayden, three with the Wheeler, and five\r\nwith the King Survey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clarence King]\r\n\r\nIn planning the initial work of the United States Geological Survey, the\r\nDirector speaks of the “most important geological subjects” and “mining\r\nindustries,” of “instructive geological structure” and “great bullion\r\nyield” in the same sentences, so that the intent was plain to make the\r\ngeologic investigations both theoretical and practical.\r\n\r\nIt was expected that the field of operations of this Federal Survey\r\nwould be at once extended by Congress over the whole United States, but\r\nthe measure making this extension, which would simply carry out the\r\nintent of the framers of the legislation creating the new bureau, passed\r\nthe House alone, and it was only by subsequent modification of the\r\nwording of appropriation items that the United States Geological Survey\r\nbecame national in scope as well as in name. The critical question of\r\nthe effective coördination of State and Federal geologic surveys was met\r\nby Director King, who corrected an erroneous impression “industriously\r\ncirculated” by stating his policy to be to urge the inauguration and\r\ncontinuance of State surveys.[104] This was the initial step in the\r\ncooperation between State and Federal surveys which became effective on\r\na large scale in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nThough the Geological Survey has extended its operations over the whole\r\nUnited States, its largest activities have always been directed toward\r\nthe exploration and development of the newer territory in the\r\npublic-land States. All four of its directors had their field training\r\nin the West: the name of Major Powell, who succeeded King in 1880, is\r\ninseparably connected with scientific exploration; Charles D. Walcott,\r\nwho was Director from 1894 to 1907, the period of the Survey’s greatest\r\nexpansion, made the largest contribution to the Paleozoic stratigraphy\r\nand paleontology of the West; and the present Director spent seven field\r\nseasons in the Northern Cascades and one in a mining district in Utah.\r\nThe scope of the activities both East and West as developed during the\r\n39 years since the establishment of the new bureau can be best\r\ndescribed, perhaps, in terms of its present functions as expressed in\r\nthe organization of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the Survey is measured in the increase of annual\r\nappropriation from $106,000 in 1879–80 to the amount available for the\r\ncurrent year—$1,925,520, not including half a million dollars from War\r\nDepartment appropriations being spent in the topographic work of the\r\nSurvey. The corresponding increase in personnel has been from 39, listed\r\nin the first report, to 911 holding regular appointments at the present\r\ntime, divided among the different branches as follows: A scientific\r\nforce of 173 in the Geologic Branch, 169 in the Water Resources Branch,\r\n71 in the Topographic Branch, and 15 in the Land Classification Board,\r\nwith a clerical force of 168 divided among the same branches, and the\r\nremainder the technical and clerical employees of the publication and\r\nadministrative branches. These personnel statistics are not expressive\r\nof normal conditions, since a large number of the topographic engineers\r\nare commissioned officers and thus are not included on the civilian\r\nroll, while, on the other hand, the classification of the stock-raising\r\nhomestead lands makes the technical force of the Water Resources Branch\r\nunusually large this year.\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of the Geological Survey is geologic, whether directed\r\nby authority of law toward the “examination of the geological structure,\r\nmineral resources, and products of the national domain,” toward the\r\npreparation of the authorized “reports upon general and economic geology\r\nand paleontology,” of the “geologic map of the United States,” or of the\r\n“report on the mineral resources of the United States,” or toward the\r\n“continuation of the investigation of the mineral resources of Alaska”\r\nor “chemical and physical researches relating to the geology of the\r\nUnited States.” The spirit and the purpose of the Survey’s work in all\r\nthese fields are not believed to have materially changed from those of\r\nthe founders of the science in America. From time to time too much\r\nemphasis may have appeared to be laid upon applied geology as contrasted\r\nwith pure science, yet the report of the National Academy to Congress in\r\nterms placed the stress upon economic resources and referred to\r\npaleontology as “necessarily connected” with general and economic\r\ngeology. The practical purpose of geologic research under Government\r\nauspices must be recognized by the administrator, whether he be the\r\npaleontologist like Walcott, the philosopher like Powell, or the mining\r\ngeologist like King. That the task of steering the true course is no new\r\nproblem can be seen from the statement of Owen[105] written 70 years\r\nago, and these words describe conditions of Government geological work\r\neven to-day:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Scientific researches, which to some may seem purely speculative and\r\n  curious, are essential as preliminaries to these practical results.\r\n  Further than such necessity dictates, they have not been pushed,\r\n  except as subordinate and incidental, and chiefly at such periods as,\r\n  under the ordinary requirements of public service, might be regarded\r\n  as leisure moments; so that the contributions to science thus\r\n  incidentally afforded, and which a liberal policy forbade to neglect,\r\n  may be considered, in a measure, a voluntary offering, tendered at\r\n  little or no additional expense to the department.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe increased attention given to mineral resources has been a matter of\r\ngradual growth. Mr. King early organized a Division of Mining Geology\r\nwith Messrs. Pumpelly, Emmons, and Becker as geologists in charge, to\r\nwhom were assigned the collection of mineral statistics for the Tenth\r\nCensus. These Survey geologists and Director King himself held\r\nappointments as special agents of the Census Bureau, and on the staff\r\nselected for this work appear the names of T. B. Brooks, Edward Orton,\r\nT. C. Chamberlin, Eugene A. Smith, George Little, J. R. Proctor, R. D.\r\nIrving, N. S. Shaler, John Hays Hammond, Bailey Willis, and G. H.\r\nEldridge, indicating the extent to which the supervision of these\r\ninquiries was placed in the hands of economic geologists. This procedure\r\nwas reverted to by Director Walcott and in the last ten years has become\r\na well-established policy, the statistics of annual production of all\r\nthe important mineral products being under the charge of geologists, as\r\nbest qualified to comprehend the resources of the country. Another of\r\nthese special assistants in 1880 was Albert Williams, Jr., who became\r\nthe first chief of the Division of Mineral Resources, in 1882. The study\r\nof ore deposits, which may be said to have begun with the King Survey,\r\nwas inspired by King’s own appreciation of the broad geologic relations\r\nof the distribution of mineral wealth and by the detailed studies of\r\nindividual mining districts by his associates, “based upon facts\r\naccurately determined in the light of modern geology.”\r\n\r\nGeological surveys have been prosecuted in Alaska since 1895, and in the\r\nlast few years the annual appropriation for the work has been the same\r\nas that made for the expenses of the whole Survey in the first year of\r\nits history. The Division of Alaskan Mineral Resources is in fact a\r\ngeological survey in itself, except that it shares in the administrative\r\nmachinery of the larger organization and has the advantage of the\r\ncooperation of the scientific specialists of the Survey as they may be\r\nneeded to supplement its own force. All the investigations in this\r\ndistant part of the country represent the Geological Survey at its best,\r\nfor here the organization’s long experience in the Western States can be\r\napplied to most effective and helpful work on the frontier, where the\r\ngeologist and topographer in their exploration do not always follow the\r\nprospector but often precede him. Undoubtedly no greater factor has\r\ncontributed to the development of Alaskan resources than this pioneer\r\nwork of the Federal Survey, yet the work has also contributed notable\r\nadditions to the sciences of geology and geography.\r\n\r\nThe first duty laid upon the Director of the Geological Survey in the\r\nlaw of 1879 was “the classification of the public lands,” and this\r\nphrase undoubtedly expressed the idea of the committee of the National\r\nAcademy. The same legislation, however, contained provision for the\r\nfurther consideration by a commission of the classification and\r\nvaluation of the public lands, as also recommended by the National\r\nAcademy. Thus the decision of Director King that the classification\r\nintended by Congress was scientific and was intended for general\r\ninformation and not to aid the Land Office in the disposition of land by\r\nsale or otherwise was really based upon the deliberate opinion of the\r\nPublic Lands Commission, of which he was a member, that classification\r\nwould seriously impede rapid settlement of the unoccupied lands. Nearly\r\nforty years later those who are intrusted with the land-classification\r\nwork of the Geological Survey recognize this familiar argument, which\r\nundoubtedly had much more force in that earlier stage of the utilization\r\nof the Nation’s resources of land.[106] The conception of land\r\nclassification as a business policy on the part of the Government as a\r\nlanded proprietor belongs rather to this day of more intensive\r\ndevelopment. At present current public-land legislation calls for\r\nhighest use, and hence official investigation of natural values and\r\npossibilities must precede disposition. This type of mineral and\r\nhydrographic classification of public lands has been in progress in\r\nincreasing amount since 1906, so that now the Geological Survey is the\r\nkind of scientific adviser to the Secretary of the Interior and\r\nCommissioner of the General Land Office that may have been contemplated\r\nby the National Academy of Sciences in 1878. It is plain, however, to\r\neveryone at all conversant with Western conditions that the recent\r\nland-classification surveys in Wyoming, for instance—detailed geologic\r\nsurveys which form the basis for the valuation of public coal lands in\r\n40–acre units—would have possessed no utility in 1871, when the\r\ncoal-land law was passed but when the demand for railroad fuel had just\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nThe land-classification idea is of course the basis of the National\r\nforest and irrigation movements. The laws of 1888 and 1896, which mark\r\nthe beginning of active endorsement by Congress of these conservation\r\nmovements, placed upon the Survey the duties of examining reservoir\r\nsites and forest reserves respectively. The earlier of these laws began\r\nthe investigation of the water resources of the country, which is still\r\nan important phase of the Survey’s activity, and led to the creation of\r\nan independent organization—the Reclamation Service. It is easy to trace\r\nthe beginnings of Federal reclamation of arid lands in the pioneer work\r\nof Powell, whose report in 1878 on the arid region of the United States\r\nwas the first adequate statement of the problem of largest use of these\r\nlands in terms broader than those of individualistic endeavor. For\r\nyears, however, Powell’s appeal for Congressional consideration of this\r\nNational task was like the “voice of one crying in the wilderness.”\r\n\r\nIn a somewhat similar way the forestry surveys under the Geological\r\nSurvey helped in the organization of a separate bureau—now the Forest\r\nService. The other important Federal bureau tracing direct relationship\r\nto the Survey is the Bureau of Mines, established in 1910, which\r\ncontinued the investigations in mining technology specifically provided\r\nfor by Congress for six years under the Geological Survey but in some\r\ndegree begun in the early days of the Survey under Directors King and\r\nPowell.\r\n\r\nAnother equally important organization of a public nature, though not a\r\nFederal bureau, traces its beginnings to the Geological Survey: the\r\nGeophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution, which now exercises\r\nso potent an influence over geologic investigation, had its origin in\r\nthe official work of the Geological Survey’s Division of Chemical and\r\nPhysical Research, and its personnel was at first largely recruited from\r\nthe Survey. The highly original experimental work of this laboratory has\r\nextended far beyond the scope of the Survey’s work—at least far beyond\r\nthe scope possible with the Federal funds available—yet most of the\r\nresults of these investigations may eventually come under even a strict\r\nconstruction of the language used in the Survey’s appropriation “for\r\nchemical and physical researches relating to the geology of the United\r\nStates.”\r\n\r\nThe topographic work of the present Survey continues with constant\r\nrefinement of standards and economy of methods the work of the earlier\r\norganizations. The primary purpose of these topographic surveys is to\r\nprovide the bases for geologic maps, yet these topographic maps, which\r\ncover 40 per cent of the area of the United States, are used in every\r\ntype of civil engineering as well as by the public generally. The annual\r\ndistribution by sale of half a million of these maps is an index of\r\ntheir value to the people.\r\n\r\nThe hot discussion that was waged for years on the question of military\r\nversus scientific administration of topographic surveys is in striking\r\ncontrast with the present concentration of all the topographic mapping\r\nunder the Geological Survey in those areas where it may best serve the\r\nneeds of the Army. In 1916 Congress specifically recognized the\r\npossibility of greater cooperation of this kind, both in the\r\nappropriation made to the Geological Survey and in a special\r\nappropriation made to the War Department. For a number of years indeed\r\nspecial military information had been contributed to the Army by the\r\nSurvey topographers, but since March 26, 1917, every Geological Survey\r\ntopographer has worked exclusively on the program of military surveys\r\nlaid down by the General Staff of the Army, and the places of some of\r\nthe 44 Survey topographers now in France as engineer officers are filled\r\nby 34 other reserve engineer officers detailed by order of the Secretary\r\nof War to the Director of the Geological Survey to assist in this\r\nmilitary mapping and to receive instruction fitting them in turn for\r\ntopographic service in France.\r\n\r\nThe contribution of this civilian service to the military operations in\r\nthe present emergency forms a fitting conclusion to this review of a\r\ncentury of Government surveys. At present 215 members of the Geological\r\nSurvey are in uniform, 107 as engineer officers, two of whom are on the\r\nstaff of the American Commanding General in France. In the war work\r\ncarried on in the United States the Survey’s contribution is by no means\r\nlimited to military mapping: the geologists are also mobilized for\r\nmeeting war needs, assisting in developing new sources of the essential\r\nwar minerals, in speeding up production of mineral products, in\r\ncollecting information for the purchasing officers both of our own and\r\nof the Allied governments, in coöperating with the constructing\r\nquarter-masters in the location of gravel and sand for structural use\r\nand in both general and special examinations of underground water supply\r\nand of drainage possibilities at cantonment sites, and in supplying the\r\nNavy Department with similar technical data. A special contribution has\r\nbeen the application to aërial surveys of photogrammetric methods\r\ndeveloped in the Alaskan topographic work and the perfection of a camera\r\nspecially adapted to airplane use. The utilization of the Survey’s map\r\nengraving and printing plant for confidential and urgent work for both\r\nthe Army and Navy has necessitated postponement of current work for the\r\nGeological Survey itself. Throughout the organization the records, the\r\nmethods, and the personnel which represent the product of many years of\r\nscientific activity are all being utilized; thus is the experience of\r\nthe past translated into special service in the present crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _Notes._\r\n\r\nFootnote 96:\r\n\r\n  Hess, R.

For long decades, vertebrate\r\npaleontology was simply a branch of comparative anatomy or morphology in\r\nthat it dealt almost exclusively with the form and other peculiarities\r\nof fossil bones and teeth, often in a more or less fragmentary\r\ncondition, very little or no attention being paid to any other system of\r\nthe creature’s anatomy. Distribution both in space and in time was\r\nrecorded, but the value of vertebrates in stratigraphy was still to be\r\nappreciated and has hardly yet come into its own. It is readily seen,\r\ntherefore, that the two departments of paleontology did not enlist the\r\nsame workers or even the same type of investigators, for while the two\r\nsciences have much in common and should have more, the vertebratist\r\nmust, above all else, be a morphologist, with a keen appreciation of\r\nform, and a mind capable of retaining endless structural details and of\r\nvisualizing as a whole what may be known only in part. The initial work\r\nof the brilliant Cuvier set so high a standard of preparedness and\r\nmental equipment that as a consequence, the number of those engaged in\r\nvertebrate research has never been large as compared with the workers in\r\nsome other branches of science, but the results achieved by the few who\r\nhave consecrated their research to the fossil vertebrates has been in\r\nthe main of a high order.\r\n\r\nAt first, as has been emphasized, this work was largely morphological,\r\ndealing both with the individual skeletal elements and later with the\r\nbony framework as a whole. Then came the endeavor to clothe the bones\r\nwith sinews and with flesh—to imagine, in other words, the\r\nlife-appearance of the ages-departed form—with such of its habits as\r\ncould be deduced from structure of body, tooth, and limb. Next came the\r\nworking out of systematic series of vertebrates and their marshalling\r\ninto species, genera, and larger groups, and much time was thus spent,\r\nespecially when rapid discovery brought a continual stream of new forms\r\nbefore the systematist, and hence some appreciation of the countless\r\nhosts of bygone creatures which peopled the world in the geologic past.\r\nThis systematic work, however, was based upon the most painstaking\r\nmorphologic comparisons and so the science was still within the scope of\r\ncomparative anatomy.\r\n\r\nIn connection with taxonomic research came increasingly tangible\r\nevidence in favor of the law of evolution; investigators turned to the\r\nworking out of phyletic series showing the actual record of the\r\nsuccessive evolutionary changes that the various races had undergone.\r\nCoupled with this evolutionary evidence came an increased attention to\r\nthe sequential occurrence in successive geologic strata, and the\r\nstratigraphic distribution of vertebrates became known with greater and\r\ngreater detail. Then followed the assemblage of faunas, which brought\r\nthe study of the fossil forms within the realm of historical geology,\r\nrather than being the mere phylogeny of a single race, and the value of\r\nvertebrate fossils as horizon markers became more and more appreciated\r\nby the stratigrapher. They serve to supplement the knowledge gained from\r\nthe invertebrates, and in this connection are especially valuable in\r\nthat they often give data concerning continental formations about which\r\ninvertebrate paleontology is largely silent.\r\n\r\n\r\n              _Rise of Vertebrate Paleontology in Europe._\r\n\r\nTo those who had been nurtured in the belief in a relatively recent\r\ncreation covering in its entirety a period of but six days, and\r\noccurring but four millenniums before the time of Christ, the appearance\r\nof the remains of creatures in the rocks, the like of which no man ever\r\nsaw alive, must have given scope to the wildest imaginings concerning\r\ntheir origin and significance; for many believed that not only had no\r\nnew forms been added to the world’s fauna since the creation, except\r\npossibly by hybridizing, but that none had become extinct save a very\r\nfew through the agency of human interference. The supposition was,\r\ntherefore, that such creatures as were thus discovered were still extant\r\nin some more remote fastnesses of the world. Thus, our second president,\r\nThomas Jefferson, who wrote one of the first papers on American fossil\r\nvertebrates, published in 1798, discussed therein the remains of a huge\r\nground-sloth which has since borne the name _Megalonyx jeffersoni_.\r\nJefferson, however, described the great claws as pertaining to a huge\r\nleonine animal which he firmly believed was yet living among the\r\nmountains of Virginia.\r\n\r\nCuvier (1769–1832) has been spoken of as the founder of our science. His\r\nopportunity lay in the profusion of bones buried in the gypsum deposits\r\nof Montmartre within the environs of the city of Paris. Cuvier’s studies\r\nof these remains, done in the light of his very broad anatomical\r\nknowledge, enabled him to prepare the first reconstructions of fossil\r\nvertebrates ever attempted and to bring before the eyes of his\r\ncontemporaries a world peopled with forms which were utterly extinct.\r\nThat these creatures were no longer living, none was a better judge than\r\nCuvier, for his prominence was such that material was sent him from all\r\nparts of the world, to which must be added that which he saw in his\r\nvisits to the various museums of Europe. He felt it safe, therefore, to\r\naffirm the unlikelihood of any further discovery of unknown forms among\r\nthe great mammals of the present fauna of our globe, and few indeed have\r\nbeen the additions since his day. To Cuvier is due not alone the\r\nmasterly contribution to the sister sciences of comparative anatomy and\r\nvertebrate paleontology—the Ossements Fossiles (1812)—but he also\r\nannounced the presence in continental strata of a series of faunas which\r\nshowed a gradual organic improvement from the earliest such assemblage\r\nto the most modern, an idea of the most fundamental importance and one\r\nwith which he is rarely credited. He believed in the sudden and complete\r\nextinction of faunas, and the facts then known were in accord with this\r\nidea, as no common genera nor transitional forms connected the creatures\r\nof the Paris gypsum with the mastodons, elephants, and hippopotami which\r\nthe later strata disclosed. It is not remarkable, therefore, that Cuvier\r\nadvanced his theory of catastrophism to account for these extinctions.\r\nHe should not, however, according to Depéret, be credited with the idea\r\nof successive re-creations, such as that held by D’Orbigny and others,\r\nbut of repopulation by immigration from some area which the catastrophe,\r\nbe it flood or other destructive agency, failed to reach.\r\n\r\nCuvier was followed in Europe by a number of illustrious men, none of\r\nwhom, however, with the exception of Sir Richard Owen, possessed his\r\nbreadth of knowledge of comparative anatomy upon which to base their\r\nresearches among the prehistoric. The more notable of them may be\r\nenumerated before going on to a discussion of the American contributions\r\nto the science.\r\n\r\nThey were, first, Louis Agassiz, a pupil of Cuvier and later a resident\r\nof America, whose researches on the fossil fishes of Europe are a\r\nmonumental work, the result of ten years of investigation in all of the\r\nlarger museums of that continent, and which appeared in 1833–43, while\r\nhe was yet a young man. The fishes were practically the only fossil\r\nvertebrates to come within the scope of his investigations, for his\r\nlater time was consumed in the study of glaciers and of recent marine\r\nzoology. Another student of these most primitive vertebrates who left an\r\nenduring monument was Johannes Mϋller. Huxley, Traquair, and Jaekel also\r\ndid masterly work upon this group, while Smith Woodward of the British\r\nMuseum is considered the highest living authority upon fossil fishes.\r\n\r\nOf the Amphibia, the most famous foreign students were Brongniart,\r\nJaeger, Burmeister, Von Meyer, and Owen, although Owen’s claim to\r\neminence lies rather in the investigations of fossil reptiles which he\r\nbegan in 1839 and continued over a period of fifty years of remarkable\r\nachievement. Not only did he describe the dinosaurs of Great Britain in\r\na series of splendidly illustrated monographs, but extended his\r\nresearches to the curious reptilian forms from the Karroo formation of\r\nSouth Africa. It was to him, moreover, that the establishment of the\r\ntrue position of the famous _Archœopteryx_ as the earliest known bird\r\nand not a reptile is due. Von Meyer also enriched the literature of\r\nfossil reptiles, discussing exhaustively those occurring in Germany,\r\nwhile Huxley’s classic work on the crocodiles as well as on dinosaurs,\r\nand the labors of Buckland, Fraas, Koken, Von Huene, Gaudry, Hulke,\r\nSeeley, and Lydekker have added immensely to our knowledge of the group.\r\n\r\nOf the birds, which at best are rare as fossils, our knowledge,\r\nespecially of the huge flightless moas, is due largely again to Owen,\r\nand his realization of the systematic position of _Archœopteryx_ has\r\nalready been mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe mammals were, perhaps, the most prolific source of paleontological\r\nresearch during the nineteenth century, for, as Zittel has said,\r\nCuvier’s famous investigations on the fossil bones, mentioned above, not\r\nonly contain the principles of comparative osteology, but also show in a\r\nmanner which has never been surpassed how fossil vertebrates ought to be\r\nstudied, and what are the broad inductions which may be drawn from a\r\nseries of methodical observations. Such was Cuvier’s influence that\r\nuntil Darwin began to interest himself in mammalian paleontology the\r\nstudy of these forms was conducted entirely along the lines indicated by\r\nthe French savant. This was seen in a large work, Osteology of Recent\r\nand Fossil Mammalia, by De Blainville, which, although not up to the\r\nstandard set by the master, is nevertheless a notable contribution, as\r\nwas also the Osteology prepared by Pander and D’Alton. A summary of the\r\nknowledge of the fossil Mammalia up to the year 1847 is contained in\r\nGiebel’s Fauna der Vorwelt, and Lydekker has done for the mammals in the\r\nBritish Museum what Smith Woodward did for the fishes, producing vastly\r\nmore than the mere catalogue which the title implies.\r\n\r\nThe first work wherein the fossil mammals were treated genealogically\r\nwas Gaudry’s Enchaînements du Monde Animal, written in 1878. Other work\r\non the fossil Mammalia was done by Kaup, who described those from the\r\nMainz basin and from Epplesheim near Worms whence came one of the most\r\nfamous of prehistoric horses, the _Hipparion_; this horse, together with\r\nthe remarkable proboscidean _Dinotherium_, was described by Von Meyer.\r\nOne of the most remarkable discoveries, ranking in importance, perhaps,\r\nnext to Montmartre, was that of the Pliocene fauna of Pikermi near\r\nAthens, Greece, first made known through the publications of A. Wagner\r\nof Munich and later, and much more extensively, through that of Gaudry\r\n(1862–1867). H. von Meyer was Germany’s best authority on fossil\r\nMammalia. After his death the work was carried on by Quenstedt, Oscar\r\nFraas, Schlosser, Koken, and Pohlig, among others.\r\n\r\nIn France, rich deposits of fossil mammals were discovered in the\r\nDepartment of Puy-de-Dôme, the Rhone basin, Sansan, Quercy, and near\r\nRheims. These were described by a number of writers, notably Croizet and\r\nJobert, Pomel, Lartet, Filhol, and Lemoine.\r\n\r\nRütimeyer of Bâle was one of the most famous European writers on\r\nmammalian paleontology, and his researches were both comprehensive and\r\nclothed in such form as to give them a high place in paleontological\r\nliterature. He studied comparatively the teeth of ungulates, discussed\r\nthe genealogy of mammals, and the relationships of those of the Old and\r\nNew Worlds. He was an exponent of the law of evolution as set forth by\r\nDarwin, and his “genealogical trees of the Mammalia show a complete\r\nknowledge of all the data concerning the different members in the\r\nsuccession, and are amongst the finest results hitherto obtained by\r\nmeans of strict scientific methods of investigation” (Zittel, History of\r\nGeology and Palæontology, 1901). The mammals of the Swiss Eocene have\r\nbeen studied in much detail by Stehlin.\r\n\r\nFor Great Britain, the most notable contributors were Buckland in his\r\nReliquiæ Diluvianæ; Falconer, co-author with Cautley on the Tertiary\r\nmammals of India; Charles Murchison, who wrote on rhinoceroses and\r\nproboscideans; and more recently Bush, Flower, Lydekker, Boyd Dawkins,\r\nL. Adams, and C. W. Andrews. But by far the most commanding figure of\r\nall was Sir Richard Owen, who for half a century stood without a peer as\r\nthe greatest of authorities on fossil mammals. It was the Natural\r\nHistory of the British Fossil Mammals and Birds, published in 1846, that\r\nestablished Sir Richard’s reputation.\r\n\r\nRussia has produced much mammalian material, especially from the\r\nTertiary of Odessa and Bessarabia, and from the Quaternary of northern\r\nRussia and Siberia. These have been described mainly by J. F. Brandt, A.\r\nvon Nordmann, but especially by Mme. M. Pavlow of Moscow.\r\n\r\nForsyth-Major discovered in 1887 a fauna contemporaneous with that of\r\nPikermi in the Island of Samos in the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable recent discoveries of fossil localities was\r\nthat announced in 1901 by Mr. Hugh J. L. Beadnell of the Geological\r\nSurvey of Egypt and Doctor C. W. Andrews of the British Museum of\r\nLondon, of numerous land and sea mammals of Upper Eocene and Lower\r\nOligocene age in northern Egypt. The exposures lay about 80 miles\r\nsouthwest of Cairo in the Fayûm district and are the sediments of an\r\nancient Tertiary lake, a relic of which, Birket-el-Qurun, yet remains.\r\nThese beds contained ancient Hyracoidea, Sirenia, and Zeuglodontia, but\r\nabove all, ancestral Proboscidea which, together with those known\r\nelsewhere, enabled Andrews to demonstrate the origin and evolutionary\r\nfeatures of this most remarkable group of beasts. This discovery in the\r\nFayûm lends color to the belief that Africa may have been the ancestral\r\nhome of at least five of the mammalian orders, those mentioned above,\r\ntogether with the Embrithopoda, a group unknown elsewhere. This theory\r\nhad been advanced independently by Tullberg, Stehlin, and Osborn, before\r\nthe discovery in Egypt.\r\n\r\nAnother European worker of pre-eminence who wrote more broadly than the\r\nfaunal studies mentioned above was W. Kowalewsky. He discussed\r\nespecially the evolutionary changes of feet and teeth in ungulates, a\r\nline of research afterward developed in greater detail by the Americans,\r\nCope and Osborn.\r\n\r\nSouth America has yielded series of rich faunas which have been\r\nexploited by the great Argentinian, Florentino Ameghino, and by the\r\nEuropeans, Owen, Gervais, Huxley, Von Meyer, and more recently by\r\nBurmeister and Lydekker. Later exploration and research by Hatcher and\r\nScott of North America will be discussed further on in this paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Vertebrate Paleontology in America._\r\n\r\n_Early Writers._—Having thus summarized paleontological progress in the\r\nOld World, we can turn to a consideration of the work done in the New,\r\nespecially in the United States, because while the Old World\r\ninvestigation has been invaluable, a science of vertebrate paleontology,\r\nvery complete both as to its zoological and geological scope and in the\r\nextent and value of published results, could be built exclusively upon\r\nthe discoveries and researches made by Americans. The science of\r\nvertebrate paleontology may be said to have had its beginnings in North\r\nAmerica with the activities of Thomas Jefferson, who, like Franklin,\r\nfelt so strong an interest in scientific pursuits that even the graver\r\nduties of the highest office in the gift of the American people could\r\nnot deter him from them. When in 1797 Jefferson came to be inaugurated\r\nas vice-president of the United States, he brought with him to\r\nPhiladelphia not only his manuscript but the actual fossil bones upon\r\nwhich it was based. Again in 1801 he was greatly interested in the\r\nShawangunk mastodon, despite heavy cares of state, and in 1808 made part\r\nof the executive mansion in Washington serve as a paleontological\r\nlaboratory, displaying therein for study the bones of proboscideans and\r\ntheir contemporaries which the Big Bone Lick of Kentucky had produced.\r\nJefferson’s work would not, perhaps, have been epoch-making were it not\r\nfor its unique chronological position in the annals of the science.\r\n\r\nJefferson was followed by another man—this time one whose diverging\r\nlines of interest led him not into the realm of political service, but\r\nof art, for Rembrandt Peale possessed an enviable reputation among the\r\nearly painters of America. Peale published in 1802 an account of the\r\nskeleton of the “mammoth,” really the mastodon, _M. americanus_,\r\nspeaking of it as a nondescript carnivorous animal of immense size found\r\nin America. It was because of the form of the molar teeth that Peale\r\nsaid of it: “If this animal was indeed carnivorous, which I believe\r\ncannot be doubted, though we may as philosophers regret it, as men we\r\ncannot but thank Heaven that its whole generation is probably extinct.”\r\n\r\nWith the work of these men as a beginning, it is not strange that the\r\nmore conspicuous Pleistocene fossils of the East should have attracted\r\nthe attention of many subsequent writers in the first part of the\r\nnineteenth century, nor that the early papers to appear in the Journal\r\nshould pertain to proboscideans or to the huge edentate ground-sloths\r\nand the aberrant zeuglodons whose bones frequently came to light.\r\nTherefore a number of men such as Koch, both Sillimans, J. C. Warren,\r\nand others made these forms their chief concern.\r\n\r\n_Fossil Footprints._—Among the early writers who concerned themselves\r\nwith these greater fossils was Edward Hitchcock, sometime president of\r\nAmherst College, and a geologist of high repute among his\r\ncontemporaries. Hitchcock is, however, better and more widely known as\r\nthe pioneer worker on a series of phenomena displayed as in no other\r\nplace in the region in which he made his home. These are fossil\r\nfootprints impressed upon the Triassic rocks of the Connecticut valley.\r\nIt was in the Journal for the year 1836 (=29=, 307–340) that Hitchcock\r\nfirst called attention to the footmarks, although they had been known\r\nand discussed popularly for a number of years previous. James Deane, of\r\nGreenfield, was perhaps the first to appreciate the scientific interest\r\nof these phenomena, but deeming his own qualifications insufficient\r\nproperly to describe them, he brought them to the attention of\r\nHitchcock, and the interest of the latter never waned until his death in\r\n1864. Hitchcock wrote paper after paper, publishing many of them in the\r\nJournal, again in his Final Report on the Geology of Massachusetts\r\n(1841), and later in quarto works, one in the Memoirs of the American\r\nAcademy of Arts and Sciences and the two others under the authority of\r\nthe Commonwealth, the Ichnology in 1858, and the Supplement in 1865, the\r\nlast being a posthumous work edited by his son, Charles H. Hitchcock.\r\n\r\nHitchcock’s conception of the track-makers was more or less imperfect\r\nbecause of the fact that for a long time but a few fragmentary osseous\r\nremains were known, either directly or indirectly associated with the\r\ntracks, while on the other hand the bird-like character of many of the\r\nlatter and the discovery of huge flightless birds elsewhere on the globe\r\nsuggested a very close analogy if not a direct relationship. Hence “bird\r\ntracks” they were straightway called, a designation which it has been\r\ndifficult to remove, even though in 1843 Owen called attention to the\r\nneed of caution in assuming the existence of so highly organized birds\r\nat so early a period, especially when large _reptiles_ were known which\r\nmight readily form very similar tracks. The footprints are now believed\r\nto be very largely of dinosaurian origin, and dinosaurs whose feet\r\ncorresponded in every detail with the footprints have actually come to\r\nlight within the same geologic and geographic limitations. This of\r\ncourse refers to the bipedal, functionally three-toed tracks. Of the\r\nmakers of certain of the obscurer of the quadrupedal trails we are as\r\nmuch in the dark to-day as were the first discoverers of a century ago,\r\nso far as demonstrable proof is concerned. We assume, however, that they\r\nwere the tracks of amphibia and reptiles, beyond which we may not go\r\nwith certainty.\r\n\r\nAgassiz, writing in 1865 (Geological Sketches), says:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “To sum up my opinion respecting these footmarks, I believe that they\r\n  were made by animals of a prophetic type, belonging to the class of\r\n  reptiles, and exhibiting many synthetic characters. The more closely\r\n  we study past creations, the more impressive and significant do the\r\n  synthetic types, presenting features of the higher classes under the\r\n  guise of the lower ones, become. They hold the promise of the future.\r\n  As the opening overture of an opera contains all the musical elements\r\n  to be therein developed, so this living prelude of the creative work\r\n  comprises all the organic elements to be successively developed in the\r\n  course of time.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOf those whose work was contemporaneous with that of Hitchcock, but one,\r\nW. C. Redfield, wrote on Triassic phenomena, and he concerned himself\r\nmainly with the fossil fishes of that time, his first paper on this\r\nsubject appearing in 1837 in the Journal (=34=, 201), and the last\r\ntwenty years later.\r\n\r\n_Paleozoic Vertebrates._—Later the vertebrates of the Paleozoic began to\r\nattract attention, footprints from Pennsylvania being described by Isaac\r\nLea, beginning in 1849, a notice of his first paper appearing in the\r\nJournal for that year (=9=, 124). Several papers followed on the reptile\r\n_Clepsysaurus_. Alfred King also wrote on the Carboniferous ichnites,\r\nhis work slightly antedating that of Lea, but being less authoritative.\r\n\r\nBut by far the most illuminating of the mid-century writers on Paleozoic\r\nvertebrates was Sir William Dawson, a very large proportion of whose\r\nnumerous papers relate to the Coal Measures of Nova Scotia and their\r\ncontained plant and animal remains. In 1853 appeared Dawson’s first\r\nannouncement, written in collaboration with Sir Charles Lyell, of the\r\nfinding of the bones of vertebrates within the base of an upright fossil\r\ntree trunk at South Joggins. These bones were identified by Owen and\r\nWyman as pertaining to a reptilian or amphibian to which the name\r\n_Dendrerpeton acadianum_ was given. Following this were several papers\r\npublished in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, London,\r\ndescribing more vertebrates and associated terrestrial molluscs. In 1863\r\nDawson summarized his discoveries in the Journal (=36=, 430–432) under\r\nthe title of “Air-breathers of the Coal Period,” a paper which was\r\nexpanded and published under the same title in the Canadian Naturalist\r\nand Geologist for the same year. Dawson also printed in the same volume\r\nthe first account of reptilian(?) footprints from the coal. Thus from\r\ntime to time there emanated from his prolific pen the account of further\r\ndiscoveries, both in bones and footprints, his final synopsis of the\r\nair-breathing animals of the Paleozoic of Canada appearing in 1895. The\r\nonly other group of vertebrates which claimed his attention were certain\r\nwhales, on which he occasionally wrote.\r\n\r\n_Fishes._—The fossil fishes from the Devonian of Ohio found their first\r\nexponent in J. S. Newberry, appointed chief geologist of the second\r\ngeological survey of Ohio, which was established in 1869. These fishes\r\nfrom the Devonian shales belonged for the greater part to the curious\r\ngroup of armored placoderms, the remains of which consist very largely\r\nof armor plates with little or no traces of internal skeleton. There was\r\nalso found in association a shark, _Cladoselache_, of such marvelous\r\npreservation that from some of the Newberry specimens now in the\r\nAmerican Museum of Natural History, New York, Bashford Dean has\r\ndemonstrated the histology of muscle and visceral organs, in addition to\r\nthe very complete skeletal remains.\r\n\r\nNewberry’s work on these forms, begun in 1868, has been carried to\r\nfurther completion by Bashford Dean and his pupil L. Hussakof, as well\r\nas by C. R. Eastman. Newberry’s other paleontological work was with the\r\nCarboniferous fishes of Ohio, the Carboniferous and Triassic fishes of\r\nthe region from Sante Fé to the Grand and Green rivers, Colorado, and on\r\nthe fishes and plants of the Newark system of the Connecticut valley and\r\nNew Jersey. He also discussed certain mastodon and mammoth remains, and\r\nthose of the peccary of Ohio, _Dicotyles_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Joseph Leidy (1823–1891)._\r\n\r\nWe now come to a consideration of the work of Joseph Leidy, one of the\r\nthree great pioneers in American vertebrate paleontology, for if we\r\ndisregard the work of Hitchcock and others on the fossil footprints, few\r\nof the results thus far obtained were based upon the fruits of organized\r\nresearch. Leidy began his publication in 1847 and continued to issue\r\npapers and books from time to time until the year 1892, having published\r\nno fewer than 219 paleontological titles, and 553 all told. His earlier\r\npaleontological researches were exclusively on the Mammalia, which were\r\nthen coming in from the newly discovered fossil localities of the West.\r\nThe discovery of these forms, one of the most notable events in the\r\nhistory of our science, will bear re-telling.\r\n\r\nThe first announcement was made in 1847, when Hiram A. Prout of St.\r\nLouis published in the Journal (3, 248–250) the description of the\r\nmaxillary bone of “_Palæotherium_” (= _Titanotherium proutii_)from near\r\nWhite River, Nebraska. This at once drew the attention of geologists and\r\npaleontologists to the Bad Lands, or Mauvaises Terres, which were to\r\nprove so highly productive of fossil forms. About the same time S. D.\r\nCulbertson of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, submitted to the Academy of\r\nNatural Sciences at Philadelphia some fossils sent to him from Nebraska\r\nby Alexander Culbertson. These were afterward described by Leidy in the\r\nProceedings of the Academy, together with the paleotheroid jaw, in\r\naddition to which three other collections which had been made were also\r\nplaced at his disposal for study.\r\n\r\nThis aroused the interest of Doctor Spencer F. Baird of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, who sent T. A. Culbertson to the Bad Lands to make further\r\ncollections. The latter was successful in securing a valuable series of\r\nmammalian and chelonian remains. These, together with other specimens\r\nfrom the same locality, were sent to Leidy, for, as Baird remarked,\r\nLeidy, although only thirty years of age, was the only anatomist in the\r\nUnited States qualified to determine their nature. The outcome of\r\nLeidy’s study of this material was “The Ancient Fauna of Nebraska,”\r\npublished in 1853, and constituting the most brilliant work which up to\r\nthat time American paleontology had produced. Leidy’s determinations,\r\nwhich are in the main correct, are the more remarkable when it is\r\nrealized that he had little recent osteological material for comparative\r\nstudy. The forms thus described by him were new to science, of a more\r\ngeneralized character than those now living, and yet their distinguished\r\ndescriber recognized, either at that time or a little later, their true\r\nrelationship to the modern types. The extent of Leidy’s anatomical\r\nknowledge was almost Cuvierian, and Cuvier-like he established the fact\r\nof the presence of the rhinoceroses, then unheard of in the American\r\nfauna, from a few small fragments of molar teeth, an opinion shortly to\r\nbe fully sustained through the finding of complete molars and the entire\r\nskull of the _same individual animal_.\r\n\r\nLeidy next turned his attention to the huge edentates, which he studied\r\nexhaustively, publishing his results in the form of a memoir in 1855,\r\ntwo years after the appearance of the “Ancient Fauna.”\r\n\r\nExtinct fishes of the Devonian of Illinois and Missouri and the Devonian\r\nand Carboniferous of Pennsylvania were made the subjects of his next\r\nresearches, after which he described the peccaries of Ohio, and later,\r\nin a much larger and most important work, the Cretaceous reptiles of the\r\nUnited States (1865). Most of the fossils discussed in this last work\r\nare from the New Jersey Cretaceous marls and of them the most notable\r\nwas the herbivorous dinosaur _Hadrosaurus_, the structure and habits of\r\nwhich, together with its affinities with the Old World iguanodons, Leidy\r\ndescribed in detail. From Leidy’s descriptions and with his aid,\r\nWaterhouse Hawkins was enabled to restore a replica of the skeleton in a\r\nremarkably efficient way. This restoration for a long time graced the\r\nmuseum of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences and there was a\r\nplaster replica of it in the United States National Museum. These,\r\ntogether with plaster replicas of _Iguanodon_ from the Royal College of\r\nSurgeons in London, gave to Americans their first real conceptions of\r\nmembers of this most remarkable group. The associated fossils from the\r\nNew Jersey marls were chiefly crocodiles and turtles.\r\n\r\nFrom 1853 to 1866 F. V. Hayden was carrying on a series of most\r\nenergetic explorations in the West, especially in Nebraska and Dakota as\r\nthen delimited, returning from each trip laden with fossils which were\r\ngiven to Leidy for determination. The results appeared in 1869 in\r\nLeidy’s Extinct Mammalian Fauna of Dakota and Nebraska, published as\r\nvolume =7= of the Journal of the Philadelphia Academy. In this large\r\nvolume no fewer than seventy genera and numerous species of forms, many\r\nof them new to science, were described, representing many of the\r\nprincipal mammalian orders; horses were, however, especially\r\nconspicuous. This last group led Leidy to the conclusion, afterward\r\nemphasized by Huxley, that North America was the home of the horse in\r\ngeologic time, there being here a greater representation of different\r\nspecies than in any recent fauna of the world. Leidy’s interest in the\r\nhorses, for the forwarding of which he made a large collection of recent\r\nmaterial, extended over many years, as his first paper on the subject\r\nbears the date of 1847, the last that of 1890.\r\n\r\nNext came the discovery of Eocene material from the vicinity of Fort\r\nBridger, Wyoming, geologically older than the Nebraska and Dakota\r\nformations. This, together with specimens from the Green River and\r\nSweetwater River deposits of Wyoming and the John Day River (Oligocene)\r\nof Oregon, was also referred to Leidy, and added yet more to the list of\r\nnewly discovered species with which he had already become familiar in\r\nhis earlier researches. The results of this study were published by the\r\nHayden Survey in 1873, under the title “Contributions to the Extinct\r\nVertebrate Fauna of the Western Territories.” This was the last of\r\nLeidy’s major works, but he continued up to the time of his death to\r\nreport to the Academy concerning the various fossil forms that were\r\nsubmitted to him for identification. Of such reports the most important\r\nwas one on the fossils of the phosphate beds of South Carolina,\r\npublished in the Journal of the Academy in 1887.\r\n\r\nAs a paleontologist, Leidy ranks with Cope and Marsh high among those\r\nwho enriched the American literature of the subject, but it must be\r\nremembered that this was but a single aspect of his many-sided\r\nscientific career, for he made many contributions of high order to\r\nbotany, zoology, and general and comparative anatomy as well, nor did\r\nhis knowledge and usefulness as an instructor of his fellow men keep\r\nwithin the limitations of these subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Othniel Charles Marsh (1831–1899)._\r\n\r\nThe sixth decade of the nineteenth century saw the beginning of the\r\nlabors of several paleontologists who, like Leidy, were destined to\r\nraise the science of fossil vertebrates in America to the level of\r\nattainment of the Old World. They were, among others, Othniel Charles\r\nMarsh and Edward Drinker Cope. Of these the names of Marsh and Cope are\r\nlinked together by the brilliance of their attainments, their\r\ncontemporaneity, and the rivalry which the similarity of their pursuits\r\nunfortunately engendered. Marsh produced his first paleontological paper\r\nin 1862 (=33=, 278), Cope in 1864, but the latter died first, so that\r\nhis life of research was shorter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: O. C. Marsh]\r\n\r\nTo Professor Marsh should be given credit for the first organized\r\nexpedition designed exclusively for the collection of vertebrate\r\nremains, the results of which contain so much material that it has not\r\nyet entirely seen the light of scientific exposition. Marsh’s first trip\r\nto the West was in 1868, the first formal expedition being organized two\r\nyears later. These expeditions, of which there were four, were privately\r\nfinanced except for the material and military escort furnished by the\r\nUnited States Government, and consisted of a personnel drawn entirely\r\nfrom the graduate or undergraduate body of Yale University. These\r\nparties explored Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Utah, and Oregon, and\r\nreturned laden with material from the Cretaceous and Tertiary formations\r\nof the West. Some of this is of necessity somewhat fragmentary, but type\r\nafter type was secured which, with his exhaustive knowledge of\r\ncomparative anatomy, enabled Marsh to announce discovery after discovery\r\nof species, genera, families, and even orders of mammals, birds, and\r\nreptiles which were unknown to science. The year 1873 saw the last of\r\nthe student expeditions, and thereafter until the close of his life the\r\nwork of collecting was done under Marsh’s supervision, but by paid\r\nexplorers, many of whom had been his scouts and guides in the formal\r\nexpeditions or had been especially trained by him in the East. In 1882,\r\nafter fourteen years of the experience thus gained, Marsh was appointed\r\nvertebrate paleontologist to the United States Geological Survey, which\r\nrelieved him in part of the personal expense connected with the\r\ncollecting, although up to within a short time of his death his own\r\nfortune was very largely spent in enlarging his collections. After his\r\nconnection with the Survey was established, Marsh had two main purposes\r\nin view in making the collections: (1) to determine the geological\r\nhorizon of each locality where a large series of vertebrate fossils was\r\nfound, and (2) to secure from these localities large collections of the\r\nmore important forms sufficiently extensive to reveal, if possible, the\r\nlife histories of each. Marsh believed that the material thus secured\r\nwould serve as key or diagnostic fossils to all horizons of our western\r\ngeology above the Paleozoic, a belief in which he was in advance of his\r\ntime, for few of his contemporaries appreciated the value of vertebrates\r\nas horizon markers. The result of the fulfilment of his second purpose\r\nsaw the accumulation of huge collections from all horizons above the\r\nTriassic and some Paleozoic and Triassic as well. These contained some\r\nvery remarkable series, each of which Marsh hoped to make the basis of\r\nan elaborate monograph to be published under the auspices of the Survey.\r\nOne can visualize the scope of his ambitions by the fact that no fewer\r\nthan twenty-seven projected quarto volumes, to contain at least 850\r\nlithographic plates, were listed by him in 1877. These covered, among\r\nother groups, the toothed birds (Odontornithes), Dinocerata, horses,\r\nbrontotheres, pterodactyls, mosasaurs and plesiosaurs, monkeys,\r\ncarnivores, perissodactyls and artiodactyls, crocodiles, lizards,\r\ndinosaurs, various birds, proboscideans, edentates and marsupials, brain\r\nevolution, and the Connecticut Valley footprints. Much was done towards\r\nthe preparation of these memoirs, as evidenced by the long list of\r\npreliminary papers, admirably illustrated by woodcuts which were to form\r\nthe text figures of the memoirs, which appeared with great regularity in\r\nthe pages of the Journal for a period of thirty years. Of the actual\r\nmemoirs, however, but two had been published at the time of Marsh’s\r\ndeath in 1899—the Odontornithes in 1880 and the Dinocerata in 1884. One\r\nmust not overlook, however, the epoch-making Dinosaurs of North America,\r\nwhich was published by the Survey in 1896, although it was not in the\r\nform nor had it the scope of the proposed monographs. This was not due\r\nto lack of application, for Professor Marsh was an indefatigable worker,\r\nbut rather to the fact that the program was of such magnitude as to\r\nnecessitate a patriarchal life span for its consummation. As it is,\r\nProfessor Marsh’s fame rests first upon his ability and intrepidity as a\r\ncollector, ready himself to brave the very certain hardships and dangers\r\nwhich beset the field paleontologist in the pioneer days, and also by\r\nhis judgment and command of men to secure the very adequate services of\r\nothers and so to direct their endeavors that the results were of the\r\nhighest value. The material witness to Marsh’s skill as a collector lies\r\nin the collections of the Peabody Museum at Yale and in the Marsh\r\ncollection at the United States National Museum, the latter secured\r\nthrough the funds of the United States Geological Survey. Together they\r\nconstitute what is possibly the greatest collection of fossil\r\nvertebrates in America, if not in the world; individually, they are\r\nsecond only to that of the American Museum in New York City, the result\r\nof the combined labors of Osborn and Cope and their very able corps of\r\nassistants.\r\n\r\nAs a scientist Marsh possessed in large measure that wide knowledge of\r\ncomparative anatomy so necessary to the vertebrate paleontologist, and\r\nas a consequence was not only able to recognize affinities and classify\r\nunerringly, but also to recognize the salient diagnostic features of the\r\nform before him and in few words so to describe them as to render the\r\nrecognition of the species by another worker relatively easy. The\r\npublication of hundreds of these specific diagnoses in the Journal\r\nconstitutes a very large and valuable part of that periodical’s\r\ncontribution to the advancement of our science. Marsh’s method of\r\nindicating forms by so brief a statement leaves much to be done,\r\nhowever, in the way of further description of his types, which in many\r\ninstances were but partially prepared.\r\n\r\nYet another important service which Marsh rendered to science was the\r\nrestoration of the creatures as a whole, made with the most painstaking\r\ncare and precision through assembling the drawings of the individual\r\nbones. These restorations have become classic, embracing as they did a\r\nscore or more of forms, of beast, bird, and reptile. They also were\r\npublished first in the Journal, although they have subsequently been\r\nreproduced in text-books and other works the world over. Part of Marsh’s\r\npopular reputation, at least, which was second to that of no other\r\nAmerican in his line, was due to his skill in attaining publicity, for\r\nhis papers, of whatever extent, were carefully and methodically sent to\r\ncorrespondents in the uttermost parts of the earth, and thus the Marsh\r\ncollection has reflected the fame of its maker.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Edward Drinker Cope (1840–1897)._\r\n\r\nThe third great name in American vertebrate paleontology, that of Edward\r\nDrinker Cope, stands out in sharp contrast with the other two, although\r\nin the range of his interests he was probably more nearly comparable\r\nwith Leidy than with Marsh. The beginning of Cope’s scientific labors\r\ndates from 1859, the year made famous in the annals of science by the\r\nappearance of Darwin’s Origin of Species. It is not surprising,\r\ntherefore, that matters evolutional should have interested him to the\r\nvery end of his career. Cope was not merely a paleontologist, but was\r\ninterested in recent forms, especially the three lower classes of\r\nvertebrates, to such an extent that his work therewith is highly\r\nauthoritative and in some respects epoch-making. Thirty-eight years of\r\nalmost continual toil were his, and the mere mass of his literary\r\nproductions is prodigious, especially when one realizes that, unlike\r\nthose of a writer of fiction, they were based on painstaking research\r\nand philosophical thought. The greater part of Cope’s life was spent in\r\nor near Philadelphia except for his western explorations, and he is best\r\nknown as professor of geology and paleontology in the University of\r\nPennsylvania, although he served other institutions as well.\r\n\r\nCope’s early work was among the amphibia and reptiles, his first\r\npaleontological paper, the description of _Amphibamus grandiceps_,\r\nappearing in 1865. This year he also began his studies of the mammals,\r\nespecially the Cetacea, both living and extinct, from the Atlantic\r\nseaboard. The next year saw the beginning of his work on the material\r\nfrom the Cretaceous marls of New Jersey, describing therefrom one of the\r\nfirst carnivorous dinosaurs, _Lælaps_, to be discovered in America. In\r\n1868 Cope began to describe the vertebrates from the Kansas chalk and\r\nthree years later made his first exploration of these beds. This led to\r\nhis connection with the United States Geological Survey of the\r\nTerritories under Hayden, and to continued exploration of Wyoming and\r\nColorado in 1872 and 1873. The material thus gained, consisting of\r\nfishes, mosasaurs, dinosaurs, and other reptiles, was described in the\r\nTransactions of the American Philosophical Society as well as in the\r\nSurvey Bulletins. In 1875 these results were summarized in a large\r\nquarto volume entitled “Vertebrata of the Cretaceous formations of the\r\nWest.” Subsequent summers were spent in further exploration of the\r\nBridger, Washakie, and Wasatch formations of Wyoming, the Puerco and\r\nTorrejon of New Mexico, and the Judith River of Montana. The material\r\ngathered in New Mexico proved particularly valuable, and led to the\r\npublication in 1877 of another notable volume entitled “Report upon the\r\nExtinct Vertebrata obtained in New Mexico by Parties of the Expedition\r\nof 1874.”\r\n\r\nMaterial was now accumulating so fast as to necessitate the\r\nconcentration of Cope’s own time on research, so that, while he\r\ncontinued to make brief journeys to the West, the real work of\r\nexploration was delegated to Charles H. Sternberg and J. L. Wortman,\r\nboth of whom became subsequently very well known, the former as a\r\ncollector whose active service has not yet ceased, the latter as an\r\nexplorer and later an investigator of extremely high promise.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1865, Cope began no fewer than five separate lines of\r\nresearch which he pursued concurrently for the remainder of his career.\r\nOn the fishes, he became a high authority in the larger classification,\r\nowing to his researches into their phylogeny, for which a knowledge of\r\nextinct forms is imperative. On amphibia, he wrote more voluminously\r\nthan any other naturalist, discussing not only the morphology but the\r\npaleontology and taxonomy as well. In this connection must be mentioned\r\nnot only Cope’s exploration and collections in the Permian of Ohio and\r\nIllinois, but especially the remains from the Texas Permian, first\r\nreceived in 1877, upon which some of his most brilliant results were\r\nbased; these of course included reptilian as well as amphibian material.\r\nHis third line of research, the Reptilia, is in part included in the\r\nforegoing, but also embraced the reptiles of the Bridger and other\r\nTertiary deposits, those of the Kansas Cretaceous, and the Cretaceous\r\ndinosaurs.\r\n\r\nUp to 1868 Leidy alone was engaged in research in the West, but that\r\nyear saw the simultaneous entrance of Marsh and Cope into this new field\r\nof research, and their exploration and descriptions of similar regions\r\nand forms soon led to a rivalry which in turn developed into a most\r\nunfortunate series of controversies, mainly over the subject of\r\npriority. This resulted in a permanent rupture of friendship and the\r\ndivision of American workers into two opposing camps to the detriment of\r\nthe progress of our science. This breach has now been happily healed,\r\nand for a number of years the degree of mutual good will and aid on the\r\npart of our workers has been of the highest sort.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the western fossil area, and particularly the explorations\r\nof three of Cope’s aids, Wortman in the Big Horn and Wasatch basins,\r\nBaldwin in the Puerco of New Mexico, and Cummins in the Permian of\r\nTexas, gave him so fruitful a field of endeavor that the occasion for\r\njealous rivalry was largely removed. The most manifest result of Cope’s\r\nwestern work was the publication in 1883 of his Vertebrata of the\r\nTertiary Formations of the West, which formed volume =3= of the quarto\r\npublications of the Hayden Survey. This huge book contains more than\r\n1000 pages and 80 plates and has been facetiously called “Cope’s Bible.”\r\n\r\nCope’s philosophical contributions, which covered the domains of\r\nevolution, psychology, ethics, and metaphysics, began in 1868 with his\r\npaper on The Origin of Genera. In evolution he was a follower of\r\nLamarck, and as such, with Hyatt, Ryder, and Packard, was one of the\r\nfounders of the so-called Neo-Lamarckian School in America. Cope’s\r\nprincipal contribution, set forth in his Factors of Organic Evolution,\r\nis the idea of kinetogenesis or mechanical genesis, the principle that\r\nall structures are the direct outcome of the stresses and strains to\r\nwhich the organism is subjected. Weismann’s forcible attack on the\r\ntransmission theory did not shake Cope’s faith in these doctrines, for\r\nhe claimed that the paleontological evidence for the inheritance of such\r\ncharacters as are apparently the result of _individual_ modification was\r\ntoo strong to be refuted. Cope was more like Lamarck than any other\r\nnaturalist in his mental make-up as well as his ideas. He was also, like\r\nHaeckel, given to working out the phylogeny of whatever type lay before\r\nhim, and in many instances arrived marvellously near the truth as we now\r\nsee it.\r\n\r\nAssociated for a while with A. S. Packard, Cope soon became chief editor\r\nand proprietor of the American Naturalist, which was for many years his\r\nmain means of publication and thus served our science in a way\r\ncomparable to the Journal. As Osborn says by way of summation:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Cope is not to be thought of merely as a specialist in Paleontology.\r\n  After Huxley he was the last representative of the old broad-gauge\r\n  school of anatomists and is only to be compared with members of that\r\n  school. His life work bears marks of great genius, of solid and\r\n  accurate observation, and at times of inaccuracy due to bad logic or\r\n  haste and overpressure of work.... As a comparative anatomist he ranks\r\n  both in the range and effectiveness of his knowledge and his ideas\r\n  with Cuvier and Owen.... As a natural philosopher, while far less\r\n  logical than Huxley, he was more creative and constructive, his\r\n  metaphysics ending in theism rather than agnosticism.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _1870–1880._\r\n\r\nThe seventh decade was productive of comparatively few great names in\r\nthe history of our science, but two, J. A. Ryder and Samuel W.\r\nWilliston, being notable contributors. The former produced but few\r\npapers and those between 1877 and 1892, yet they were of note and such\r\nwas their influence that he is named with Hyatt, Packard, and Cope as\r\none of the founders of the Neo-Lamarckian School of evolutionists in\r\nAmerica. Ryder was a particular friend and a colleague of Cope, as they\r\nwere both concerned with the back-boned animals, while the other two\r\nwere invertebratists. Ryder wrote on mechanical genesis of tooth forms\r\nand on scales of fishes, also on the morphology and evolution of the\r\ntails of fishes, cetaceans, and sirenians, and of the other fins of\r\naquatic types. He did, on the other hand, practically no systematic or\r\ndescriptive work.\r\n\r\nWilliston, on the contrary, has had a long and varied career as an\r\ninvestigator and as an educator. Trained at Yale, he prepared for\r\nmedicine, and much of his teaching has been of human anatomy, both at\r\nYale and at the University of Kansas where he served for a number of\r\nyears as dean of the Medical School. He is also a student of flies, and\r\nas such not only the foremost but indeed almost the only dipterologist\r\nin the United States. But it is with his work as a vertebrate\r\npaleontologist that we are chiefly concerned, and here again he stands\r\namong the foremost. His initial work and training in this department of\r\nscience were with Marsh, for whom he spent many months in field work,\r\ncollecting largely in the Niobrara Cretaceous of Kansas. He did,\r\nhowever, no research while with Marsh, owing to the latter’s\r\ndisinclination to foster such work on the part of his associates.\r\nWilliston began his publications in 1878 and has continued them until\r\nthe present, working mainly with Cretaceous mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, and\r\npterodactyls. Of late, since his transference to the University of\r\nChicago, where as professor of paleontology and director of the Walker\r\nMuseum he has served since 1902, his interest has lain mainly among the\r\nPaleozoic reptiles and amphibia. Williston’s more notable works are\r\nAmerican Permian Vertebrates and Water Reptiles of the Past and Present,\r\nwherein he sets forth his views of the phylogenesis and taxonomy of the\r\nreptilian class. He is at present at work on the evolution of the\r\nreptiles, a volume which is eagerly awaited by his colleagues. It is in\r\nmorphology that Williston’s greatest strength lies and some of his most\r\neffective work on the mosasaurs has appeared in the Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _1880–1900._\r\n\r\nThe next decade, that of 1880–1890, saw a number of notable additions to\r\nthe workers in vertebrate paleontology: Henry F. Osborn, W. B. Scott, R.\r\nW. Shufeldt, J. L. Wortman, George Baur, F. A. Lucas, and F. W. True.\r\nShufeldt is our highest authority on the osteology of birds, both recent\r\nand extinct, having recently described all of the extinct forms\r\ncontained in the Marsh collection; True wrote of Cetacea; Lucas of\r\nmarine and Pleistocene mammals and birds, and has also written popular\r\nbooks on prehistoric life. Lucas’s greatest service, however, lies in\r\nthe museums, where he has manifested a genius second to none in the\r\ninstallation of mute evidences of living and past organisms. Wortman was\r\nfor a time associated with Cope, later with Osborn in the American\r\nMuseum, again at the Carnegie Museum at Pittsburgh, and finally at Yale\r\nin research on the Bridger Eocene portion of the Marsh collection. His\r\nwork has been chiefly the perfection of field methods in vertebrate\r\npaleontology, and as a special investigator of Tertiary Mammalia,\r\ntreating the latter largely from the morphologic and taxonomic\r\nstandpoints. Wortman’s Yale results on the carnivores and primates of\r\nthe Eocene, as yet unfinished, were published in the Journal in\r\n1901–1904.\r\n\r\nWilliam B. Scott is a graduate of Princeton, and has spent thirty-four\r\nyears in her service as Blair Professor of Geology and Paleontology. His\r\nfirst publication, in 1878, issued in conjunction with Osborn and Speir,\r\ndescribed material collected by them in the Eocene formations of the\r\nWest, and since that time Scott’s research has been entirely with the\r\nmammals, on which he is one of our highest authorities. His most notable\r\nworks have been a History of Land Mammals of the Western Hemisphere,\r\n1913, and the results of the Patagonian expeditions by Hatcher, which\r\nare published in a quarto series in conjunction with W. J. Sinclair,\r\nalthough they are the authors of separate volumes, Scott’s work being\r\nmainly on the carnivores and edentates of the Santa Cruz formation. It\r\nis as a systematist in research and as an educator that Scott has\r\nattained his highest usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe man who, next to the three pioneers, has attained the highest\r\nreputation in vertebrate paleontologic research, is Henry Fairfield\r\nOsborn. Graduate of Princeton in the same class that produced Scott,\r\nOsborn served for a time as professor of comparative anatomy in that\r\ninstitution, and in 1891 was called to New York to organize the\r\ndepartment of zoology in Columbia University and that of vertebrate\r\npaleontology in the American Museum of Natural History. He had, early in\r\nhis career, gone west in company with Professor Scott, and had collected\r\nmaterial from the Eocene formation of Wyoming, upon which they based\r\ntheir first joint paper in 1878, Osborn’s first independent production,\r\na memoir on two genera of Dinocerata, appearing in 1881. A number of\r\npapers followed, on the Mesozoic Mammalia, on Cope’s tritubercular\r\ntheory, and on certain apparent evidences for the transmission of\r\nacquired characters. It was, however, with his acceptance of the New\r\nYork responsibilities, especially at the American Museum, that Osborn’s\r\nmost significant work began. Aided first by Wortman and Earle, later by\r\nW. D. Matthew and others, he has built up the greatest and most complete\r\ncollection of fossil vertebrates extant; its value, however, was largely\r\nenhanced through the purchase of the private collection of Professor\r\nCope, which of course included a large number of types. The American\r\nMuseum collection thus contains not only a vast series of representative\r\nspecimens from every class and order of vertebrates, secured by purchase\r\nor expedition from nearly all the great localities of the world, but an\r\nexhibition series of skulls and partial and entire skeletons and\r\nrestorations which no other institution can hope to equal. Based upon\r\nthis wonderful material is a large amount of research, filling many\r\nvolumes, published for the greater part in the bulletin and memoirs of\r\nthe Museum. This research is not only the product of the staff,\r\nincluding Walter Granger, Barnum Brown, W. D. Matthew, and W. K.\r\nGregory, but also of a number of other American and some foreign\r\npaleontologists as well.\r\n\r\nProfessor Osborn’s own work has been voluminous, his bibliography from\r\n1877 to 1916 containing no fewer than 441 titles, ranging over the\r\nfields of paleontology,—which of course includes the greater\r\nnumber—geology, correlation and paleogeography, evolutionary principles\r\nexemplified in the Mammalia, man, neurology and embryology, biographies,\r\nand the theory of education.\r\n\r\nIn paleontology, Osborn’s researches have been largely with the Reptilia\r\nand Mammalia, partly morphological, but also taxonomic and evolutional.\r\nFaunistic studies have also been made of the mammals. Of his published\r\nvolumes the most important are, first, the Age of Mammals (1910), in\r\nwhich he treats not of evolutionary series of phylogenies, but of faunas\r\nand their origin, migrations, and extinctions, and of the correlation of\r\nOld and New World Tertiary deposits and their contents. Men of the Old\r\nStone Age (1916) is an exhaustive treatise and is the first full and\r\nauthoritative American presentation of what has been discovered up to\r\nthe present time throughout the world in regard to human prehistory. In\r\nhis latest volume, The Origin and Evolution of Life (1917), Osborn\r\npresents a new energy conception of evolution and heredity as against\r\nthe prevailing matter and form conceptions. In this volume there is\r\nsummed up the whole story of the origin and evolution of life on earth\r\nup to the appearance of man. This last book is novel in its conceptions,\r\nbut it is too early as yet to judge of the acceptance of Osborn’s theses\r\nby his fellow workers in science.\r\n\r\nSince the death of Professor Marsh, Osborn has served as vertebrate\r\npaleontologist to the United States Geological Survey, and has in charge\r\nthe carrying through to completion of the many monographs proposed by\r\nhis distinguished predecessor. One of these, that on the horned\r\ndinosaurs, has been completed by Hatcher and Lull (1907), another on the\r\nstegosaurian dinosaurs has been carried forward by C. W. Gilmore of the\r\nUnited States National Museum, while under Osborn’s own hand are the\r\nmemoirs on the titanotheres (aided by W. K. Gregory), the horses, and\r\nthe sauropod dinosaurs. Of these, the first, when it shall have been\r\ncompleted, promises to be the most monumental and exhaustive study of a\r\ngroup of fossil organisms ever undertaken.\r\n\r\nAs a leader in science, a teacher and administrator, Professor Osborn’s\r\nrank is high among the leading vertebratists. He is remarkably\r\nsuccessful in his choice of assistants and in stimulating them in their\r\nproductiveness so that their combined results form a very considerable\r\nshare of the later literature in America.\r\n\r\nThe ninth decade ushered in the work of a valuable group of students, of\r\nwhom John Bell Hatcher should be mentioned in particular, as his work is\r\ndone. Graduate of Yale in 1884, he spent a number of years assisting his\r\nteacher, Professor Marsh, mainly in the field, collecting during that\r\ntime, either for Yale or for the United States Geological Survey, an\r\nenormous amount of very fine material, especially from the West,\r\nalthough he also collected in the older Tertiary and Potomac beds near\r\nWashington. In the West he secured no fewer than 105 titanothere skulls,\r\nexplored the Tertiary, Judith River, and Lance formations, collected and\r\nin fact virtually discovered the remains of the Cretaceous mammals and\r\nof the horned dinosaurs which he was later privileged to describe. He\r\nthen (1893) went to Princeton, which he served for seven years, his\r\nprincipal work being explorations in Patagonia for the E. and M. Museum,\r\none direct result of which was the publication of a large quarto on the\r\nnarrative of the expedition and the geography and ethnography of the\r\nregion. Going to the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh in 1900, Hatcher\r\ncarried forward the work of exploration and collecting begun for that\r\ninstitution by Wortman, and as a partial result prepared many papers,\r\nthe principal ones being memoirs on the dinosaurs _Haplocanthosaurus_\r\nand _Diplodocus_. In 1903, with T. W. Stanton of the United States\r\nGeological Survey, Hatcher explored the Judith River beds and together\r\nthey settled the vexatious problem of their age, the published results\r\nappearing in 1905, after Hatcher’s death. His last piece of research,\r\nbegun in 1902 and continued until his death in 1904, was an elaborate\r\nmonograph on the Ceratopsia, one of the many projected by Marsh. Of this\r\nmemoir Hatcher had completed some 150 printed quarto pages, giving a\r\nrare insight into the anatomy of these strange forms. The final\r\nchapters, however, which were based very largely upon Hatcher’s own\r\nopinions, had to be prepared by another hand.\r\n\r\nDespite his early death, therefore, Hatcher rendered a very signal\r\nservice to American paleontology—in exploration, stratigraphy,\r\nmorphology, and systematic revision—and his activity in planning new\r\nfields of research, such, for instance, as the exploration of the\r\nAntarctic continent, gave promise of further high attainment, when his\r\nhand was arrested by death.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Summary._\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that American vertebrate paleontology has arisen to\r\nso high a plane, when one considers the material at its disposal. Having\r\na vast and virgin field for exploration, a sufficient number of\r\ncollectors, some of whom have devoted much of their lives to the work,\r\nand a refinement of technique that permitted the preservation of the\r\nfragmental and ill conserved as well as the finer specimens, the results\r\ncould hardly have been otherwise. Thus it has been possible to secure\r\nmaterial almost unique throughout the world for extent, for\r\ncompleteness, and for variety. To this must be added a certain American\r\ndaring in the matter of the restoration of missing portions, both of the\r\nindividual bones and of the skeleton as a whole, such as European\r\nconservatism will not as a rule permit. This work has for the most part\r\nbeen done after the most painstaking comparison and research and is\r\nhighly justified in the accuracy of the results, which render the fabric\r\nof the skeleton much more intelligible, both to the scientist and to the\r\nlayman. Material once secured and prepared is then mounted, and here\r\nagain American ingenuity has accomplished some remarkable results. Some\r\nof the specimens thus mounted are so small and delicate as to require\r\nholding devices comparable to those for the display of jewels; yet\r\nothers—huge dinosaurs the bones of which are enormously heavy, but so\r\nbrittle that they will not bear even the weight of a process\r\nunsupported—require a carefully designed and skilfully worked out series\r\nof supports of steel or iron which must be perfectly secure and at the\r\nsame time as inconspicuous as possible. And of late the lifelike pose of\r\nthe individual skeleton has been augmented by the preparation of groups\r\nof several animals which collectively exhibit sex, size, or other\r\nindividual variations and the full mechanics of the skeleton under the\r\nvarying poses assumed by the creature during life.\r\n\r\nThe work of further restoration has been rendered possible through\r\ncomparative anatomical study, enabling us to essay restorations in\r\nentirety by means of models and drawings, clothing the bones with sinews\r\nand with flesh and the flesh with skin and hair, if such the creature\r\nbore; while the laws of faunal coloration have permitted the coloring of\r\nthe restoration in a way which if not the actual hue of life is a very\r\nreasonable possibility.\r\n\r\nThus the American paleontologists have blazed a trail which has been\r\nfollowed to good effect by certain of their Old World colleagues.\r\n\r\nWith such means and methods and such material available, it is again not\r\nsurprising that American paleontology has furnished more and more of the\r\nevidences of evolution, and disclosed to the eyes of scientists animal\r\nrelationships which were undreamed of by the systematist whose research\r\ndealt only with the existing. It has also explained some vexatious\r\nproblems of animal distribution and of extinction, and has connected up\r\ncause and effect in the great evolutionary movements which are recorded.\r\n\r\nThe results of systematic research have added hosts of new genera and\r\nspecies and of families, but of orders there are relatively few.\r\nNevertheless a number, especially among reptiles and mammals, have come\r\nto light as the fruits of American discovery. But aside from the dry\r\ncataloguing of such groups, the American systematists have worked out\r\nsome very remarkable phylogenies and have thus clarified our vision of\r\nanimal relationships in a way which the recent zoologist could never\r\nhave done. In this connection, the Permian vertebrates, which have been\r\ncollected and studied with amazing success, principally by Williston and\r\nCase, should be mentioned, although the work is yet incomplete. Some of\r\nthese forms are amphibian, others reptilian, yet others of such\r\ncharacter as to link the two classes as transitional forms. Of the\r\nMesozoic reptiles, a very remarkable assemblage has come to light, in a\r\ndegree of perfection unknown elsewhere. These are dinosaurs, of which\r\nseveral phyla are now known; carnivores both great and small, some of\r\nthe latter being actually toothless; Sauropoda, whose perfection and\r\ndimensions are incomparable except for those found in East Africa; and\r\npredentates, armored, unarmored, and horned, the last exclusively\r\nAmerican. The unarmored trachodonts are now known in their entirety, for\r\nnot only has our West produced articulated skeletons but mummified\r\ncarcasses whose skin and other portions of their soft anatomy are\r\nrepresented, and which are thus far without a parallel elsewhere in the\r\nworld. Other reptilian groups are well known, notably the Triassic\r\nichthyosaurs, and the mosasaurs and plesiosaurs of the Kansas chalk. The\r\nlast formation has also produced toothed birds, _Hesperornis_ and\r\n_Ichthyornis_, which again are absolutely unique.\r\n\r\nBut it is in the mammalian class that the phylogenies become so highly\r\ncomplete and of such great importance as evolutionary evidences, for\r\nnowhere else than in our own West have such series been found as the\r\nDinocerata and creodonts among archaic forms, the primitive primates\r\nfrom the Eocene, the carnivores such as the dogs and cats and\r\nmustellids, but especially the hoofed orders such as the horses. Of\r\nthese hoofed orders, the classic American series of horses is complete,\r\nthat of the camels probably no less so, while much is known of the deer\r\nand oreodonts, the last showing several parallel phyla, and of the\r\nproboscideans, which while having their pristine home in the Old World\r\nnevertheless soon sought the new where their remains are found from the\r\nMiocene until their final and apparently very recent extinction. These\r\ncreatures show increase of bulk, perfection of feet and teeth,\r\ndevelopment of various weapons, horns and antlers, which may be studied\r\nin their relationship with the other organs to make the evolving whole,\r\nor their evolution may be traced as individual structures which have\r\ntheir rise, culmination, and sometimes their senile atrophy in a way\r\ncomparable to that of the representatives of the order as a whole. Thus,\r\nfor example, Osborn has traced the evolution of the molar teeth, and\r\nCope of the feet, while Marsh has shown that brain development runs a\r\nsimilar course and that its degree of perfection within a group is a\r\npotent factor for survival.\r\n\r\nAs a student of evolution, the paleontologist sees things in a very\r\ndifferent light from the zoologist. The latter is concerned largely with\r\nmatters of detail—with the inheritance of color or of the minor and more\r\nsuperficial characteristics of animals—and the period of observation of\r\nsuch phenomena is of necessity brief because of the mortality of the\r\nobserver. Whereas the paleontologist has a perspective which the other\r\nlacks, since for him time means little in the terms of his own life, and\r\nhe can look into the past and see the great and fundamental changes\r\nwhich evolution has wrought, the rise of phyla, of classes, of orders,\r\nand he alone can see the orderliness of the process and sense the\r\nmajesty of the laws which govern it.\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Influence of the American Journal of Science._\r\n\r\nThe influence of the American Journal of Science as a medium for the\r\ndissemination of the results of vertebrate research has been in evidence\r\nthroughout this discussion, but it were well, perhaps, to emphasize that\r\nservice more fully. The Journal was, as we have seen, the chief outlet\r\nfor Professor Marsh’s research, for there were published in it during\r\nhis lifetime no fewer than 175 papers descriptive of the forms which he\r\nstudied, as well as a great part of the material in the published\r\nmonographs. As Marsh left very few manuscript notes, the importance of\r\nthese frequent publications in thus setting forth much that he thought\r\nand learned concerning the material is very great indeed. The combined\r\ntitles of all other authors in the Journal in this line of research for\r\nthe century of its life fall far short of the number produced by Marsh\r\nalone, as they include 136 all told, but the range of subjects is highly\r\nrepresentative of the entire field of vertebrate research. It should be\r\nborne in mind, moreover, that Leidy, Cope, and Osborn each had another\r\nmedium of publication, which of course is true of other workers in the\r\ngreat museums such as the American, National, and Carnegie, all of which\r\nissue bulletins and quarto publications for the purpose of disseminating\r\nthe work of their staff. Many of the earlier announcements of the\r\ndiscovery of vertebrate relics appeared in the Journal, as did\r\npractically all the literature of the science of fossil footprints\r\n(ichnology), except of course the larger quartos of Hitchcock and Deane.\r\nOf the footprint papers by Hitchcock, Deane, and others, there were no\r\nfewer than thirty-two, with a number of additional communications on\r\nattendant phenomena bones and plants.\r\n\r\nUp to 1847, except for a few foreign announcements, the Journal\r\npublished almost exclusively on eastern American paleontology, the only\r\nexception being a notice of bones from Oregon by Perkins in 1842. In\r\n1847 came the announcement of a western “Palæothere” by Prout, which\r\nmarked the beginning of the researches of Leidy and others in the Bad\r\nLands of the great Nebraska plains. The Journal thenceforth published\r\npaper after paper on forms from all over North America, and on all\r\naspects of our science: discovery, systematic description, faunal\r\nrelationships, evolutionary evidences—thus showing that breadth and\r\ncatholicity which has made it so great a power in the advancement of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII\r\n                   THE RISE OF PETROLOGY AS A SCIENCE\r\n\r\n                          By LOUIS V. PIRSSON\r\n\r\n\r\n This chapter is intended to present a brief sketch of the progress of\r\nthe science of petrology from its early beginnings down to the present\r\ntime. The field to be covered is so large that this can be done only in\r\nbroadest outline, and it has therefore been restricted chiefly to what\r\nhas been accomplished in America. Although the period covered by the\r\nlife of the Journal extends backward for a century it is, however,\r\npractically only within the last fifty years that the rocks of the\r\nearth’s crust have been made the subject of such systematic\r\ninvestigation by minute and delicately accurate methods of research as\r\nto give rise to a distinct branch of geologic science. It is not\r\nintended of course to affirm by this statement that the broader features\r\nof the rocks, especially those which may be observed in the field and\r\nwhich concern their relations as geologic masses, had not been made the\r\nobject of inquiry before this time, since this is the very foundation of\r\ngeology itself. Moreover, a certain amount of investigation of rocks, as\r\nto the minerals of which they were composed, the significance of their\r\ntextures, and their chemical composition, had been carried out,\r\nconcomitant with the growth from early times of geology and mineralogy.\r\nThus, in 1815, Cordier by a process of washing separated the components\r\nof a basalt and by chemical tests determined the constituent minerals.\r\nAt the time the Journal was founded, and for many years following, the\r\ngenesis of rocks, especially of igneous rocks, was a subject of inquiry\r\nand of prolonged discussion. The aid of the rapidly growing science of\r\nchemistry was invoked by the geologists and analyses of rocks were made\r\nin the attempt to throw light on important questions. It is remarkable,\r\nalso, how keen were the observations that the geologists of those days\r\nmade upon the rocks, as to their component minerals and structures,\r\naided only by the pocket lens. Many ideas were put forward, the\r\nessentials of which have persisted to the present day and have become\r\ninterwoven into the science, whereas others gave rise to contentions\r\nwhich have not yet been settled to the satisfaction of all. At times in\r\nthese earlier days the microscope was called into use to help in solving\r\nquestions regarding the finer grained rocks, but this employment, as\r\nZirkel has shown, was merely incidental, and no definite technique or\r\npurpose for the instrument was established.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the fact that up to the middle of the last century a\r\nlarge store of information relating to the occurrence of rocks, and to\r\nthe mineral composition of those of coarser grain, and somewhat in\r\nrespect to their structure, had been accumulated, caused attempts in one\r\nway or another to find means of coördinating these data and to produce\r\nclassifications, such as those of Von Cotta and Cordier. The history of\r\nthese attempts at classification, before the revelations made by the use\r\nof the microscope had become general, has been admirably reviewed by\r\nWhitman Cross[107] and need not be further enlarged upon here.\r\n\r\nThat a considerable amount of work was done along chemical lines also is\r\ntestified to by the publication of Roth’s Tabellen in 1861, in which all\r\npublished analyses of rocks up to that date were collected. What was\r\naccomplished during this period was done chiefly on the continent of\r\nEurope, and little attention had been paid to the subject of rocks\r\neither in America or in Great Britain—even so late as 1870 Geikie\r\nremarks, as referred to by Cross,[108] that there was no good English\r\ntreatise on petrography, or the classification and description of rocks.\r\nIn this country still less had been accomplished, interest being almost\r\nwholly confined to the vigorous and growing sciences of geology and\r\nmineralogy. This was natural, for mineralogy is the chief buttress on\r\nwhich the structure of petrology rests and must naturally develop first,\r\nespecially in a relatively new and unexplored region, whose mineral\r\nresources first attract attention. The geologists in carrying out their\r\nstudies also observed the rocks as they saw them in the field and made\r\nincidental reference to them, but investigations of the rocks themselves\r\nwas very little attempted. An inspection of the first two series of the\r\nJournal shows relatively little of importance in petrology published in\r\nthis country; a few analyses of rocks, occasional mention of mineral\r\ncomposition, of weathering properties, and notices of methods of\r\nclassification proposed by French and German geologists nearly exhaust\r\nthe list.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Introduction of the Microscope._\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of a particular branch of science are generally obscure\r\nand rooted so imperceptibly in the foundations on which it rests that it\r\nis difficult to point to any particular place in its development and say\r\nthat this is the start. There are exceptions of course, like the\r\nremarkable work of Willard Gibbs in physical chemistry, and it may\r\nchance that the happy inspiration of a single worker may give such\r\ndirection to methods of investigation as to open the gates into a whole\r\nnew realm of research, and to thus create a separate scientific field,\r\nas happened in Radiochemistry.\r\n\r\nThis is what occurred in petrology when Sorby in England, in 1858,[109]\r\npointed out the value of the microscope as an instrument of research in\r\ngeologic investigations, and demonstrated that its employment in the\r\nstudy of thin sections of rocks would yield information of the highest\r\nvalue. Others beside Sorby had made use of the microscope, as pointed\r\nout by Zirkel,[110] but, as he indicates, no one before him had\r\nrecognized its value. During the next ten years or so, however, its\r\nrecognition was very slow and the papers published by Sorby himself were\r\nmainly concerned in settling very special matters.\r\n\r\nAs Williams[111] has suggested, the greatest service of Sorby was,\r\nperhaps, his instructing Zirkel in his ideas and methods, for the latter\r\nthrew himself whole-heartedly into the study of rocks by the aid of the\r\nmicroscope and his discoveries stimulated other workers in this field in\r\nGermany, his native country, until the dawning science of petrology\r\nbegan to assume form. A further step forward was taken in 1873 in the\r\nappearance of the text-books of Zirkel[112] and Rosenbusch[113] which\r\ncollated the knowledge which had been gained and furnished the\r\ninvestigator more precise methods of work. It is difficult for the\r\nstudent of to-day to realize how much had been learned in the interval\r\nand, for that matter, how much has been gained since 1873, without an\r\ninspection of these now obsolete texts. In 1863, Zirkel, who was then at\r\nthe beginning of his work, said in his first paper presented to the\r\nVienna Academy of Sciences[114] that if he confined himself chiefly to\r\nthe structure of the rocks investigated and of their component minerals,\r\nand stated little as to what these minerals were, the reason for that\r\nwas because “although the microscope serves splendidly for the\r\ninvestigation of the former relations, it promises very little help for\r\nthe latter. Labradorite, oligoclase and orthoclase, augite and\r\nhornblende, minerals whose recognition offers the most important\r\nproblems in petrography, in most cases cannot be distinguished from one\r\nanother under the microscope.” How little could Zirkel have foreseen, at\r\nthis time, less than forty years later, that not only could labradorite\r\nbe accurately determined in a rock-section, but that in a few minutes by\r\nthe making of two or three measurements on a properly selected section,\r\nits chemical composition and the crystallographic orientation of the\r\nsection itself could be determined!\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _The Thin Section._\r\n\r\nBefore going further we may pause here a moment to consider the origin\r\nand development of the thin section, without which no progress could\r\nhave been made in this field of research. When we reflect upon the\r\nmatter, it seems a marvelous thing indeed that the densest, blackest\r\nrock can be made to yield a section of the ¹⁄₁₀₀₀ of an inch in\r\nthickness, so thin and transparent that fine printing can be easily read\r\nthrough it, and transmitting light so clearly that the most high-powered\r\nobjectives of the microscope can be used to discern and study the\r\nminutest structures it presents with the same capacity that they can be\r\nemployed upon sections of organic material prepared by the microtome.\r\nThis is no small achievement.\r\n\r\nThe first thin sections appear to have been prepared in 1828 by William\r\nNicol of Edinburgh, to whom we owe the prism which carries his name. He\r\nundertook the making of sections from fossil wood for the purpose of\r\nstudying its structure. The method he developed was in principle the\r\nsame as that employed to-day, where machinery is not used; that is, he\r\nground a flat smooth surface upon one side of a chip of his petrified\r\nwood, then cemented this to a bit of glass plate with Canada balsam, and\r\nground down the other side until the section was sufficiently thin. This\r\nmethod was used by others for the study of fossil woods, coal, etc., but\r\nit was not applied to rocks until 1850, when Sorby used it for\r\ninvestigating a calcareous grit. Oschatz, in Germany, also about this\r\ntime independently discovered the same method. A further advance was\r\nmade in melting the cement, floating off the slice, and transferring it\r\nto a suitable object-glass with cover, a process still employed by many;\r\nthough most operators now cement the first prepared surface of the rock\r\nchip directly to the object-glass, and mount the section without\r\ntransferring it.\r\n\r\nNext came the use of machinery to save labor in grinding, and another\r\nstep was made in the introduction of the saw, a circular disk of sheet\r\niron whose edge was furnished with embedded diamond dust. This makes it\r\npossible to cut relatively thin slices with comparative rapidity, but\r\nthe final grinding which requires experience and skill must still be\r\ndone by hand. Carborundum has also largely replaced emery. The skill and\r\ntechnique of preparers has reached a point where sections of rocks of\r\nthe desired thinness (0·001 inch), and four or five inches square have\r\nbeen exhibited.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _The Era of Petrography._\r\n\r\nIn these earlier days of the science, as noted above, great difficulty\r\nwas at first experienced in the recognition of the minerals as they were\r\nencountered in the study of rocks under the microscope. At that time the\r\nchemical composition and outward crystal form of minerals were\r\nrelatively much better known than their physical and, especially, their\r\noptical properties and constants. Some beginnings in this had been made\r\nby Brewster, Nicol, and other physicists, and the mineralogists had\r\ncommenced to study minerals from this viewpoint. Especially Des\r\nCloiseaux had devoted himself to determining the optical properties of\r\nmany minerals, and the writer, when a student in the laboratory of\r\nRosenbusch in 1890, well recalls the tribute that he paid to the work of\r\nDes Cloiseaux for the aid which it had afforded him in his earlier\r\nresearches in petrography.\r\n\r\nThe twenty years following the publication of the texts of Rosenbusch\r\nand Zirkel may be characterized as the era of microscopical petrography.\r\nA distinction is drawn here between the latter word and petrology, a\r\ndistinction often overlooked, for _petrography_ means literally the\r\ndescription of rocks, whereas _petrology_ denotes the science of rocks.\r\nAs time passed the broader and more fundamental features of rocks,\r\nespecially of igneous and metamorphic rocks, in addition to their\r\nmineral constitution, were more studied and gained greater recognition,\r\npetrography gradually became a department of the larger field of\r\npetrology—the science of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe use of the microscope, as soon as the method became more generally\r\nunderstood, opened up so vast a field for investigation that at first\r\nthe study and description of the rocks seemed of prime importance. This\r\nwas natural, for hitherto the finer grained rocks had for the most part\r\ndefied any adequate elucidation and here was a key which enabled one to\r\nread the cipher. A flood of literature upon the composition, structure,\r\nand other characters of rocks from all parts of the world began to\r\nappear in ever increasing volume. The demands of the petrographers for a\r\ngreater and more accurate knowledge of the physical and optical\r\nconstants of minerals stimulated this side of mineralogy, and increasing\r\nattention was given to investigations in this direction. No definite\r\nline between the two closely related sciences could be drawn, and a\r\nlarge part of the work published under the heading of petrography could\r\nperhaps be as well, or better, described under the title of\r\nmicro-mineralogy. To some, in truth, the rocks presented themselves\r\nsimply as aggregates of minerals, occurring in fine grains.\r\n\r\nThe work of the German petrographers attracted attention and drew\r\nstudents from all parts of the world to their laboratories, especially\r\nto those of Zirkel and Rosenbusch. The great opportunities, facilities,\r\nand freedom for work which the German universities had long offered to\r\nforeign students of science naturally encouraged this. In France a\r\nbrilliant school of petrologists, under the able leadership of\r\nMichel-Lévy and Fouqué, had arisen whose work has been continued by\r\nBarrois, Lacroix and others, but the rigid structure of the French\r\nuniversities at that period did not permit of the offering of great\r\ninducements for the attendance of foreign students. The work of the\r\nFrench petrographers will be noticed in another connection.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain, the home of Sorby, the new science progressed at first\r\nslowly, until it was taken up by Allport, Bonney, Judd, Rutley, and\r\nothers. In 1885 the evidence of the advance that had been made and of\r\nthe firm basis on which the new science was now placed appeared in\r\nTeall’s great work, “British Petrography,” which marked an epoch in that\r\ncountry in petrographic publication. This work was of importance also in\r\nanother direction than that of descriptive petrography, in that it\r\ncontains valuable suggestions for the application of the principles of\r\nmodern physical chemistry in solving the problems of the origin of\r\nigneous rocks. In it, as in the publications of Lagorio, we see the\r\npassage of the petrographic into the petrologic phase of the science.\r\n\r\nThe earliest publication in America of the results of microscopic\r\ninvestigation of rocks that the writer has been able to find is by A. A.\r\nJulien and C. E. Wright, chiefly on greenstones and chloritic schists\r\nfrom the iron-bearing regions of upper Michigan.[115] Naturally, it was\r\nof a brief and elementary character. In 1874 E. S. Dana read a paper\r\nbefore the American Association for the Advancement of Science on the\r\nresult of his studies on the “Trap-rocks of the Connecticut valley,” an\r\nabstract of which was published in this Journal.[116] Meanwhile Clarence\r\nKing, in charge of the 40th Parallel survey, feeling the need of a\r\nsystematic study of the crystalline rocks which had been encountered,\r\nand finding no one in this country prepared to undertake it, had induced\r\nZirkel to give his attention to this task. The result of this labor\r\nappeared in 1876 in a fine volume[117] which attracted great attention.\r\nIn the same year appeared also petrographical papers by J. H.\r\nCaswell,[118] E. S. Dana[119] and G. W. Hawes.[120] The latter devoted\r\nhimself almost entirely to this field of research and may thus, perhaps,\r\nbe termed the earliest of the petrographers in this country. His work,\r\n“The Mineralogy and Lithology of New Hampshire,” issued in 1878 as one\r\nof the reports of the State Survey under Prof. C. H. Hitchcock, was the\r\nfirst considerable memoir by an American. This was followed by various\r\npapers, one on the “Albany Granite and its contact phenomena,”[121]\r\nbeing of especial interest as one of the earliest studies of a contact\r\nzone, and in the fullness of methods employed in attacking the problem\r\nforecasting the change to the petrology era.\r\n\r\nDuring the ten years following, or from 1880 to 1890, the new science of\r\npetrography flourished and grew exceedingly. Many young geologists\r\nabroad devoted themselves to this field of research and the store of\r\naccumulated knowledge concerning rocks from all parts of the world, and\r\ntheir relations grew apace. The work of Teall has been noticed and among\r\nothers might be mentioned the name of Brögger, whose first\r\ncontribution[122] in this field gave evidence that his publications\r\nwould become classics in the science.\r\n\r\nIn America there appeared in this period a number of eager workers,\r\ntrained in part in the laboratories of Rosenbusch and Zirkel, whose\r\nresearches were destined to place the science on the secure footing in\r\nthis country which it occupies to-day. Among the earlier of these may be\r\nmentioned Whitman Cross, R. D. Irving, J. P. Iddings, G. H. Williams, J.\r\nF. Kemp, J. S. Diller, B. K. Emerson, M. E. Wadsworth, G. P. Merrill, N.\r\nH. Winchell, and F. D. Adams in Canada. Others were added yearly to this\r\ngroup. As a result of their work a constantly growing volume of\r\ninformation about the rocks of America became available, and one has\r\nonly to examine the files of the Journal and other periodicals and the\r\nlisted publications of the National and State Surveys to appreciate\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nIn the Journal, for example, we may refer to papers[123] by Emerson on\r\nthe Deerfield dike and its minerals, and on the occurrence of nephelite\r\nsyenite at Beemersville, N. J.; to various interesting articles by Cross\r\non lavas from Colorado and the pneumatolytic and other minerals\r\nassociated with them; to important papers by Iddings on the rocks of the\r\nvolcanoes of the Northwest, and those of the Great Basin, to primary\r\nquartz in basalt, and the origin of lithophysæ; to the results of\r\nresearches by G. H. Williams on the rocks of the Cortlandt series, and\r\non peridotite near Syracuse, N. Y.; to papers by Diller on the\r\nperidotites of Kentucky, and recent volcanic eruptions in California; to\r\narticles by R. D. Irving on the copper-bearing and other rocks of the\r\nLake Superior region, and to Kemp on dikes and other eruptives in\r\nsouthern New York and northern New Jersey. Other publications would\r\ngreatly extend this list.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _The Petrologic Era._\r\n\r\nAs the chief facts regarding rocks, especially igneous rocks, as to\r\ntheir mineral and chemical composition, their structure and texture and\r\nthe limits within which these are enclosed, became better known; and the\r\nrelations, which these bear to the associations of rocks and their modes\r\nof occurrence, began to be perceived, the science assumed a broader\r\naspect. The perception that rocks were no longer to be regarded merely\r\nas interesting assemblages of minerals, but as entities whose characters\r\nand associations had a meaning, increased. More and better rock analyses\r\nstimulated interest on the chemical side and this and the genesis of\r\ntheir minerals led to a consideration of the magmas and their functions\r\nin rock-making. The fact that the different kinds of rocks were not\r\nscattered indiscriminately, but that different regions exhibited certain\r\ngroupings with common characters, was noticed. These features led to\r\nattempts to classify igneous rocks on different lines from those\r\nhitherto employed, and to account for their origin on broad principles.\r\nIn other words, the descriptive science of petrography merged into the\r\nbroader one of petrology. No exact time can be set which marks this\r\npassage, since the evolution was gradual. Yet for this country, in\r\nreviewing the literature, for which the successive issues of the\r\n“Bibliography of North American Geology” published by the U. S.\r\nGeological Survey has been of the greatest value; the writer has been\r\nstruck by the fact that in the first volume containing the index of\r\npapers down to and including 1891, the articles on subjects of this\r\nnature are listed under the heading of _petrography_, whereas in the\r\nsecond volume (1892–1900) they are grouped under _petrology_ and the\r\nformer heading is omitted. A justification for this is found in\r\nexamining the list of publications and noting their character. With some\r\nreason, therefore, the beginning of this period may be placed as in the\r\nearly years of this decade. Furthermore, it was at this time that the\r\ngreat work of Zirkel[124] began to appear, which sums up so completely\r\nthe results of the petrographic era. Rosenbusch[125] was formulating\r\nmore definitely his views on the division of rocks into magmatic groups,\r\nas displayed by their associations in the field, and using this in\r\nclassification; an idea which, appearing first in the second edition of\r\nhis “Physiographie der massigen Gesteine,” finds fuller development in\r\nthe third and last editions of this work. In this country Iddings[126]\r\npublished an important paper, in which the family relationships of\r\nigneous rocks and the derivation of diverse groups from a common magma\r\nby differentiation are clearly brought out. The fundamental problems\r\nunderlying the genesis of igneous rocks had now been clearly recognized,\r\nand with this recognition the science passed into the petrologic phase.\r\nBrögger[127] also had ascribed to the alkalic rocks of South Norway a\r\ncommon parentage and had pointed out their regional peculiarities.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward an attempt may be noted to find an analogy\r\nbetween rocks and the forms of organic life and to apply those\r\nprinciples of evolution and descent, which have proved so fruitful in\r\nthe advancement of the biological sciences, to the genesis and\r\nclassification of igneous rocks. This, perhaps, has on the whole been\r\nmore apparent than real, in the constant borrowing of terms from those\r\nsciences to express certain features and relationships observed, or\r\nimagined, to obtain among rocks. Nevertheless, the perception of certain\r\nrelations which we owe so largely to Rosenbusch and to Brögger[128] has\r\nproved of undoubted value in furnishing a stimulus for the investigation\r\nof new regions, and in affording indications of what the petrologist\r\nshould anticipate in his work.\r\n\r\nThus, the labors of the men previously mentioned, with those of Bayley,\r\nBascom, Cushing, Daly, Lane, Lawson, Lindgren, Pirsson, J. F. Williams,\r\nWashington, and others, have thrown a flood of light upon the igneous\r\nrocks of this continent, and has made it possible to draw many broad\r\ngeneralizations concerning their origin and distribution. Thus, the\r\ndifferentiated laccoliths of Montana[129] have been of service in\r\naffording clear examples of the process of local differentiation. Many\r\npapers published in the Journal during the last twenty years show this\r\nevolution and growth of petrological ideas. The contributions from\r\nAmerican sources during this later period, and of which those in the\r\nJournal form a considerable fraction, have indeed been of great weight\r\nin shaping the development and future of the science.\r\n\r\nBy referring to the files of the Journal, it will be seen that they\r\ncover a continually widening range of subjects concerning rocks, and\r\narticles of theoretical interest are more and more in evidence, along\r\nwith those of a purely descriptive character.[130] Thus we find\r\ndiscussions by Becker on the physical constants of rocks, on fractional\r\ncrystallization, and on differentiation; by Cross on classification; by\r\nAdams on the physical properties of rocks; by Daly on the methods of\r\nigneous intrusion; by Wright on schistosity; by Fenner on the\r\ncrystallization of basaltic magma; by Bowen on differentiation by\r\ncrystallization; by the writer on complementary rocks and on the origin\r\nof phenocrysts; by Smyth on the origin of alkalic rocks; by Murgoci on\r\nthe genesis of riebeckite rocks; and by Barrell on contact-metamorphism.\r\nThese may serve as examples, selected almost at random, from the files\r\nof the Journal, and we find with them articles descriptive of the\r\npetrology of many particular regions, which often contain also matter of\r\ngeneral interest and importance, such as papers by Lindgren on the\r\ngranodiorite and related rocks of the Sierra Nevada; by Ransome on\r\nlatite; by Cross on the Leucite Hills; by Hague on the lavas of the\r\nYellowstone Park; by Pogue on ancient volcanic rocks from North\r\nCarolina; by Warren on peridotites from Cumberland, R. I.; on sandstone\r\nfrom Texas by Goldman; and on the petrology of various localities in\r\ncentral New Hampshire by Washington and the writer. Such a list could of\r\ncourse be much extended and other papers of importance be cited, but\r\nenough has been said to indicate how important a repository of the\r\nresults of petrologic research the Journal has been and continues to be.\r\n\r\nIn thus looking backward over the list of active workers we are\r\ninvoluntarily led to pause and reflect how great a loss American\r\npetrology has sustained in the premature death of some of its most\r\nbrilliant and promising exponents; it is only necessary to recall the\r\nnames of R. D. Irving, G. H. Williams, G. W. Hawes, J. F. Williams and\r\nCarville Lewis, to appreciate this.\r\n\r\nThe store of material gathered during these years has led to the\r\npublication of extensive memoirs, in which the science is treated not\r\nfrom the older descriptive side, but from the theoretical standpoint and\r\nof classification.[131] In these works strong divergencies of views and\r\nopinions are observed, which is a healthy sign in a developing science.\r\n\r\nIt should be also noted that along with this evolution on the\r\ntheoretical side there has been a constant improvement in the technique\r\nof investigating rocks. It is only necessary to compare the older\r\nhandbooks of Zirkel and Rosenbusch with the many modern treatises on\r\npetrographic methods to be assured of this.[132] It is due on the one\r\nhand to the vast amount of careful work which has been done in\r\naccurately determining the physical constants of rock-minerals[133] and\r\nin arranging these for their determination microscopically, as in the\r\nremarkable studies on the feldspars by Michel-Lévy, and on the other in\r\nresearches on the apparatus employed, and in consequent improvements in\r\nthem and in ways of using them, as exemplified in the delicately\r\naccurate methods introduced by Wright.[134] The development of the\r\nmicroscope itself as an instrument of research in this field and in\r\nmineralogy deserves a further word in this connection. The first step\r\ntoward making the ordinary microscope of special use in this way was\r\ntaken by Henry Fox Talbot of England, when he introduced in 1834 the\r\nemployment of the recently invented nicol prisms for testing objects in\r\npolarized light. The modern instrument may be said to date from the\r\ndesign offered by Rosenbusch in 1876. Since that time there have been\r\nconstant improvements, almost year by year, until the instrument has\r\nbecome one of great precision and convenience, remarkably well adapted\r\nfor the work it is called upon to perform, with special designs for\r\nvarious kinds of use, and an almost endless number of accessory\r\nappliances for research in different branches of mineralogy and\r\ncrystallography, as well as in petrography proper.[135] This also calls\r\nto mind the fact that for the convenience of those who are not able to\r\nuse the microscope special manuals of petrology have been prepared in\r\nwhich rocks are treated from the megascopic standpoint.[136]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Metamorphic Rocks._\r\n\r\nIn this connection the metamorphic rocks should not be forgotten. They\r\nafford indeed the most difficult problems with which the geologist has\r\nto deal; every branch of geological science may in turn be called upon\r\nto furnish its quota for help in solving them. Under the attack of\r\ncareful, accurate and persistent work in the field, under the microscope\r\nand in the chemical laboratory, with the aid of the garnered knowledge\r\nin petrology, stratigraphy, physiography, and other fields of geologic\r\nscience, their mystery has in large part given way. The inaugural work\r\nof Lehmann, Lossen, Barrois, Bonney, Teall, and other European\r\ngeologists, was paralleled in America by that of R. D. Irving, owing to\r\nwhose efforts the Lake Superior region became the chief place of study\r\nof the metamorphic rocks in this country. Irving soon obtained the\r\nassistance of G. H. Williams, who had been engaged in the study of such\r\nrocks, and the latter published a memoir on the greenstone schist areas\r\nof Menominee and Marquette in Michigan[137] which will always remain one\r\nof the classics in the literature of metamorphic rocks. Irving’s own\r\ncontributions to petrology, though valuable, were cut short by his\r\nuntimely death, but the study of this region under the direction of his\r\nassociate and successor, C. R. Van Hise, with his co-laborers, has\r\nyielded a mass of information of fundamental importance in our\r\nunderstanding of metamorphism and the crystalline schists. Its fruitage\r\nappears in the memoir by Van Hise[138] which is the authoritative work\r\nof reference on metamorphism, and in various publications by him and his\r\nassistants, Bayley, Clements, Leith, and others. The work of the\r\nCanadian geologists, and of Kemp, Cushing, Smyth and Miller in the\r\nAdirondack region, should also be mentioned in connection with this\r\nfield of petrology.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Chemical Analyses of Rocks._\r\n\r\nIt has been previously pointed out that, as the science of petrology\r\ngrew, chemical investigations of rocks in bulk were undertaken. The\r\nobject of such analyses was to obtain on the one hand a better control\r\nover the mineral composition and on the other to gain an idea of the\r\nnature of the magmas from which igneous rocks had formed. The earliest\r\nanalysis of an American rock of which I can find record is of a “wacke”\r\nby J. W. Webster given in the first volume of the Journal, page 296,\r\n1818.\r\n\r\nDuring the next 40 years a few occasional analyses were undertaken by\r\nAmerican chemists, by C. T. Jackson, T. Sterry Hunt, and others. In\r\n1861, Justus Roth published the first edition of his Tabellen, in which\r\nhe included all analyses which had been made to that date and which he\r\nconsidered were worthy of preservation. Although, naturally, from the\r\nstatus of analytical chemistry up to that time, most of these would now\r\nbe considered rather crude, the publication of the work was of great\r\nservice and marked an epoch in geochemistry. In these tables Roth lists\r\nfour analyses of American igneous rocks, two from the Lake Superior\r\nregion by Jackson and J. D. Whitney and two by European chemists, one of\r\nwhom was Bunsen. The material of the last two was a “dolerite” and the\r\nsame locality is given for each—“Sierra Nevada between 38° and 41°”\r\nwhich was probably considered quite precise for western America in those\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nFrom these feeble beginnings the forward progress of petrology on the\r\nchemical side in this country has been a steady one until its\r\ndevelopment has reached the point which will be indicated in what\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nThe collection of material by the various State surveys and by those\r\ninitiated by the National Government led to an increasing number of\r\nrocks being analyzed during the petrographic period. These became also\r\nincreasingly good in quality, like those published by G. W. Hawes in his\r\npapers. When, however, chemists were appointed to definite positions on\r\nthe staffs of the Government surveys and especially when, after the\r\norganization of the U. S. Geological Survey in 1879, a general central\r\nlaboratory was founded in 1883 with F. W. Clarke in charge, then a new\r\nera in the chemical investigation of rocks may be said to have started.\r\nIn this connection should be mentioned the work of W. F. Hillebrand, who\r\nset a standard of accuracy and detail in rock analysis which had not\r\nhitherto been attempted. As a consequence of his accurate and thorough\r\nmethods and results the mass of analyses performed by him and his fellow\r\nchemists in this laboratory affords us the greatest single contribution\r\nto chemical petrology which has been made. Up to January, 1914, the\r\nreport of Clarke[139] lists some 8000 analyses of various kinds made in\r\nthis laboratory for geologic purposes. Nearly everywhere also a great\r\nimprovement in the quality of rock-analyses is to be noted, and in the\r\nmanuals of Hillebrand[140] and Washington[141] the rock analyst has now\r\nat his command the methods of a greatly perfected technique which should\r\ninsure him the best results.\r\n\r\nRoth’s Tabellen have been previously mentioned; several supplements were\r\npublished, but after his death a long interval elapsed before this\r\nconvenient and useful work was again taken up by Washington[142] and\r\nOsann.[143] A new edition of Washington’s Tables has recently been\r\npublished, listing some 8600 analyses of igneous rocks made up to the\r\nclose of 1913.[144]\r\n\r\nOn the theoretical side also, where petrology passes into geology, the\r\ninvestigator of to-day will find a mass of most useful and accurate data\r\nwell discussed in the modern representative of Bischof’s Chemical\r\nGeology—Clarke’s Data of Geochemistry.[145] The advance on the chemical\r\nside, therefore, has been quite commensurate with that in the microscope\r\nas an instrument, and in the results obtained by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Physico-Chemical Work._\r\n\r\nThe study of geological results by experimental methods, which should\r\ngain information concerning the processes by which those results are\r\ncaused, and the conditions under which they operate, has been from the\r\nearliest days of the developing science recognized as most important,\r\nand the record of the literature shows considerable was done in this\r\ndirection. Experimental work in modern petrology may, however, be\r\nconsidered to date from 1882 when Fouqué and Michel-Lévy[146] published\r\nthe results of their extensive researches on the synthesis of minerals\r\nand rocks by pyrogenous methods. The brilliant experiments of the French\r\npetrologists at once attracted attention, and since that time a\r\nconsiderable volume of valuable work has been done in this field by a\r\nnumber of men, among whom may be mentioned Morozewicz,[147]\r\nDoelter,[148] Tamman,[149] and Meunier.[150] As this work continued the\r\nresults of the rapid advances made in physical chemistry began to be\r\napplied in this field with increasing value. To J. H. L. Vogt we owe a\r\nvaluable series of papers,[151] in which the formation of minerals and\r\nrocks from magmas is treated from this standpoint. Most important of all\r\nfor the future of petrology has been the founding in Washington of the\r\nsplendid research institution, the Carnegie Geophysical Laboratory,\r\nunder the leadership of Dr. A. L. Day with its corps of trained\r\nphysicists, chemists and petrologists, devoted to the solving of the\r\nproblems which the progress of geological science raises. The\r\npublications of this institution (many of them published in the Journal)\r\nare too numerous to be mentioned here; many of them treat successfully\r\nof matters of the greatest importance in petrology. This is an earnest\r\nof what we may hope in the future. The accumulation of the exact\r\nphysical and chemical data, which is its aim, will serve as a necessary\r\ncheck to hypothetical speculation and bring petrology, and especially\r\npetrogenesis, in line with the other more exact sciences by furnishing\r\nquantitative foundations for its structure of theory to rest upon.\r\n\r\nWhile the achievements of this great organization seem to minimize the\r\nwork of the individual investigator in this field, he may take heart by\r\nobserving the important results on the strength of rocks under various\r\nconditions which have been obtained by Adams in recent years, data of\r\nwide application in theoretical geology. In this field also a special\r\ntext has appeared in which the principles and acquired data are\r\ngiven.[152]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Summary._\r\n\r\nIn this brief retrospect, giving only the barest outlines and omitting\r\nfrom necessity much of importance, we have seen petrology grow from\r\noccasional crude experiments into a fully organized science in the last\r\nhalf century. It has to-day a well-perfected technique, a large volume\r\nof literature, texts treating of general principles, of methods of work,\r\ndescriptive handbooks on the morphological side, and has attained\r\ngeneral recognition as a field, which, though not large, is worthy of\r\nthe concentration of intellectual endeavor. Like other healthy growing\r\norganisms it has given rise to offshoots, and the sciences of\r\nmetallography and of the micro-study of ore deposits, which are rapidly\r\nassuming form, have branched from it.\r\n\r\nWhat of the future? The old days of mostly descriptive work, and of\r\ntheorizing purely from observed results, have passed. The science has\r\nentered upon the stage where work and theory must be continually brought\r\ninto agreement with chemical, physical and mathematical laws and data,\r\nand in the application of these new problems present themselves. As we\r\nclimb, in fact, new horizons open to our view indicating fresh regions\r\nfor exploration, for acquiring human knowledge and for our satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Bibliography._\r\n\r\nFootnote 107:\r\n\r\n  W.

FORD\r\n\r\n\r\n Mineralogy to-day would certainly be generally considered one of the\r\nminor members of the group of the Geological Sciences. We commonly look\r\nupon it in the light of an useful handmaiden, whose chief function is to\r\nserve the other branches, and we are inclined to forget that, in\r\nreality, mineralogy was the first to be recognized and, with\r\nconsiderable truth, might be claimed as the mother of all the others.\r\nMinerals, because of their frequent beauty of color and form, and their\r\nuses as gems and as ornamental stones, were the first inorganic objects\r\nto excite wonder and comment and we find many of them named and\r\ndescribed in very early writings. Theophrastus (368–284 B. C.), a famous\r\npupil of Aristotle, wrote a treatise “On Stones” in which he collected a\r\nlarge amount of information about minerals and fossils. The elder Pliny\r\n(23–79 A. D.), more than three centuries later, in his Natural History,\r\ndescribed and named many of the commoner minerals. At this time it was\r\nnatural that no clear distinction should be drawn between minerals and\r\nrocks, or even between minerals and fossils. As long as all study of the\r\nmaterials of the earth’s crust was concerned with their superficial\r\ncharacters, it was logical to include everything under the single head.\r\nThere were some writers in the early centuries of the Christian era,\r\nhowever, who believed that fossils had been derived from living animals\r\nbut the majority considered them to be only strange and unusual forms of\r\nminerals. During many succeeding centuries little was added to the\r\ngeneral store of geological knowledge and it was not until the beginning\r\nof the sixteenth century, that any further notable progress was made.\r\nAgricola (1494–1555) was a physician, who, for a time, lived in the\r\nmining district of Joachimstal. He studied and described the minerals\r\nthat he collected there. He was the first to give careful and critical\r\ndescriptions of minerals, of their crystals and general physical\r\nproperties. Unfortunately, he also did not realize the fundamental\r\ndistinction between fossils and minerals, and probably because of his\r\ninfluence this error persisted, even until the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. But, naturally, as the number of scientific students increased,\r\nthe number of those who rejected this conclusion grew, until at last,\r\nthe true character of fossils was established. The keen interest in\r\nminerals and fossils which was aroused by this controversy, together\r\nwith the rapid extension of mining operations, drew the attention of\r\nscientific men to other features of the earth’s surface and led to a\r\nmore extended investigation of its characters and thus to the\r\ndevelopment of geology proper. It is interesting to note also that\r\nmineralogy was the first of the Geological Sciences to be officially\r\nrecognized and taught by the universities.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as has been shown, the beginnings of mineralogy lie in the\r\nremote past, the science, as we know it to-day, can be said to have had\r\npractically its whole growth during the last one hundred years. Of the\r\nmore than one thousand mineral species that may now be considered as\r\ndefinitely established hardly more than two hundred were known in the\r\nyear 1800 and these were only partially described or understood. It is\r\ntrue that Haüy, the “father of crystallography,” had before this date\r\ndiscovered and formulated the laws of crystal symmetry, and had shown\r\nthat rational relations existed between the intercepts upon the axes of\r\nthe different faces of a crystal. It was not until 1809, however, that\r\nWollaston described the first form of a reflecting goniometer, and thus\r\nmade possible the beginning of exact investigation of crystals. The\r\ndistinctions between the different crystal groups were developed by\r\nBernhardi, Weiss and Mohs between the years 1807 and 1820, while the\r\nNaumann system of crystal symbols was not proposed until 1826. The fact\r\nthat doubly refracting minerals also polarize light was discovered by\r\nMalus in 1808, and in 1813 Brewster first recognized the optical\r\ndifferences between uniaxial and biaxial minerals. The modern science of\r\nchemistry was also just beginning to develop at this period, enabling\r\nmineralogists to make analyses more and more accurately and thus by\r\nchemical means to establish the true character of minerals, and to\r\nproperly classify them.\r\n\r\nFranz von Kobell, on page 372 of his “Geschichte der Mineralogie,”\r\nsomewhat poetically describes the condition of the science at this\r\nperiod as follows: “With the end of the eighteenth and the commencement\r\nof the nineteenth centuries exact investigations in mineralogy first\r\nbegan. The mineralogist was no longer content with approximate\r\ndescriptions of minerals, but strove rather to separate the essential\r\nfacts from those that were accidental, to discover definite laws, and to\r\nlearn the relations between the physical and chemical characters of a\r\nmineral. The use of mathematics gave a new aspect to crystallography,\r\nand the development of the optical relationships opened a magnificent\r\nfield of wonderful phenomena which can be described as a garden gay with\r\nflowers of light, charming in themselves and interesting in their\r\nrelations to the forces which guide and govern the regular structure of\r\nmatter.”\r\n\r\nIn the Medical Repository (vol. =2=, p. 114, New York, 1799), there\r\noccurs the following notice: “Since the publication of the last number\r\nof the Repository an Association has been formed in the city of New York\r\n‘for the investigation of the Mineral and Fossil bodies which compose\r\nthe fabric of the Globe; and, more especially, for the Natural and\r\nChemical History of the Minerals and Fossils of the United States,’ by\r\nthe name and style of The American Mineralogical Society.” With this\r\nannouncement is given an advertisement in which the society “earnestly\r\nsolicits the citizens of the United States to communicate to them, on\r\nall mineralogical subjects, but especially on the following: 1,\r\nconcerning stones suitable for gun flints; 2, concerning native\r\nbrimstone or sulphur; 3, concerning salt-petre; 4, concerning mines and\r\nores of lead.” Further the society asks “that specimens of all kinds be\r\nsent to it for examination and determination.”\r\n\r\nThis marks apparently the beginning of the serious study of the science\r\nof mineralogy in the United States. From this time on, articles on\r\nmineralogical topics appeared with increasing frequency in the Medical\r\nRepository. Most of these were brief and were largely concerned with the\r\ndescription of the general characters and modes of occurrence of various\r\nminerals. Nothing of much moment from the scientific point of view\r\nappeared until many years later, but the growing interest in things\r\nmineralogical was clearly manifest. An important stimulus to this\r\nincreasing knowledge and discussion was furnished by Col. George Gibbs\r\nwho, about the year 1808, brought to this country a large and notable\r\nmineral collection. In the Medical Repository (vol. 11, p. 213, 1808),\r\nis found a notice of this collection, a portion of which is reproduced\r\nbelow:\r\n\r\n\r\n                 “Gibbs’ grand Collection of Minerals.\r\n\r\n  One of the most zealous cultivators of mineralogy in the United States\r\n  is Col. G. Gibbs of Rhode Island and his taste and his fortune have\r\n  concurred in making him the proprietor of the most extensive and\r\n  valuable assortment of minerals that probably exists in America.\r\n\r\n  This rich collection consists of the cabinets possessed by the late\r\n  Mons. Gigot D’Orcy of Paris and the Count Gregoire de Rozamonsky, a\r\n  Russian nobleman, long resident in Switzerland. To which the present\r\n  proprietor has added a number, either gathered by himself on the spot,\r\n  or purchased in different parts of Europe.... The whole consists of\r\n  about twenty thousand specimens. A small part of this collection was\r\n  opened to amateurs at Rhode Island, the last summer, and the next, if\r\n  circumstances permit, the remainder will be exposed.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1802 Benjamin Silliman was appointed professor of chemistry and\r\nmineralogy in Yale College. After the Gibbs Collection was brought to\r\nAmerica he spent much time with the owner in studying it and, as a\r\nresult, Col. Gibbs offered to place the collection on exhibition in New\r\nHaven if suitable quarters would be furnished by the college. This was\r\nquickly accomplished and in 1810, 1811 and 1812 the collection was\r\ntransferred to New Haven and arranged for exhibition by Col. Gibbs.\r\nLater, in 1825, it was purchased by Yale and served as the nucleus about\r\nwhich the present Museum collection of the University has been formed.\r\nThere is no doubt but that the presence at this early date of this large\r\nand unusual mineral collection had a great influence upon the\r\ndevelopment of mineralogical science at Yale, and in the country at\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1810 Dr. Archibald Bruce started the “American Mineralogical\r\nJournal,” the title page of which reads in part as follows: “The\r\nAmerican Mineralogical Journal, being a Collection of Facts and\r\nObservations tending to elucidate the Mineralogy and Geology of the\r\nUnited States of America, together with other Information relating to\r\nMineralogy, Geology and Chemistry, derived from Scientific Sources.”\r\nUnfortunately the health of Dr. Bruce failed, and the journal lasted\r\nonly through its first volume. It had, however, “been most favorably\r\nreceived,” as Silliman remarks, and it was felt that another journal of\r\na similar type should be instituted. Such a suggestion was made by Col.\r\nGibbs to Professor Silliman in 1817 and this led directly to the\r\nfounding of the American Journal of Science in 1818 under the latter’s\r\neditorship. Although the field of the Journal at the very beginning was\r\nmade broad and inclusive it has always published many articles on\r\nmineralogical subjects. Three of its editors-in-chief have been eminent\r\nmineralogists, and without question it has been the most important\r\nsingle force in the development of this science in the country. More\r\nthan 800 well-established mineral species have been described since the\r\nyear 1800, of which approximately 150 have been from American sources.\r\nMore than two-thirds of the articles describing these new American\r\nminerals have first appeared in the pages of the Journal. While the\r\ndescription of new species is not always the most important part of\r\nmineralogical investigation, still these figures serve to show the large\r\npart that the Journal has played in the growth of American mineralogy.\r\n\r\nIt is convenient to review the progress in Mineralogy according to the\r\ndivisions formed by the different series, consisting of fifty volumes\r\neach, in which the Journal has been published. These divisions curiously\r\nenough will be found to correspond closely to four quite definite phases\r\nthrough which mineralogical investigation in America has passed. The\r\nfirst series covered the years from 1817 to 1845. In looking through\r\nthese volumes one finds a large number of mineralogical articles, the\r\nwork of many contributors. The great majority of these papers are purely\r\ndescriptive in character, frequently giving only general accounts of the\r\nmineral occurrences of particular regions. However, a number of articles\r\ndealing with more detailed physical and chemical descriptions of rare or\r\nnew species also belong in this period. Among the mineralogists engaged\r\nat this time in the description of individual species, none was more\r\nindefatigable than Charles U. Shepard. He was graduated from Amherst\r\nCollege in 1824, at the age of twenty. In 1827 he became assistant to\r\nProfessor Silliman in New Haven, continuing in this position for four\r\nyears. Later he was a lecturer in natural history at Yale, and was at\r\nvarious times connected with Amherst College and the South Carolina\r\nMedical College at Charleston. His articles on mineralogy were very\r\nnumerous. He assigned a large number of new names to minerals, although\r\nwith the exception of some half dozen cases, these have later been shown\r\nto be varieties of minerals already known and described, rather than new\r\nspecies. In spite, however, of his frequent hasty and inaccurate\r\ndecision as to the character of a mineral, his influence on the progress\r\nof mineralogy was marked. His great enthusiasm and ceaseless industry\r\nthroughout a long life could not help but make a definite contribution\r\nto the science. His “Treatise on Mineralogy” will be spoken of in a\r\nlater paragraph. He died in May, 1886, having published his last paper\r\nin the Journal in the previous September.\r\n\r\nThe first book on mineralogy published in America was that by Parker\r\nCleaveland, professor of mathematics, natural philosophy, chemistry and\r\nmineralogy in Bowdoin College. The first edition was printed in 1816 and\r\nan exhaustive notice is given in the first volume of the Journal (1, 35,\r\n308, 1818); a second edition followed in 1822. In his preface Cleaveland\r\ngives an interesting discussion concerning the two opposing European\r\nmethods of classifying minerals. The German school, led by Werner,\r\nclassified minerals according to their external characters while the\r\nFrench school, following Haüy, put the emphasis on the “true\r\ncomposition.” Cleaveland remarks that “the German school seems to be\r\nmost distinguished by a technical and minutely descriptive language; and\r\nthe French, by the use of accurate and scientific principles in the\r\nclassification or arrangement of minerals.” He, himself, tried to\r\ncombine in a measure the two methods, basing the fundamental divisions\r\nupon the chemical composition and using the accurate description of the\r\nphysical properties to distinguish similar species and varieties from\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nCleaveland’s mineralogy was followed nearly twenty years later by the\r\nTreatise on Mineralogy by Charles U. Shepard already mentioned. The\r\nfirst part of this book was published in 1832. This contained chiefly an\r\naccount of the natural history classification of minerals according to\r\nthe general plan adopted by Mohs, the Austrian mineralogist. The second\r\npart of the book, which appeared in 1835, gave the description of\r\nindividual species, the arrangement here being an alphabetical one\r\nthroughout. Subsequent editions appeared in 1844, 1852 and 1857.\r\n\r\nJames Dwight Dana was graduated from Yale College in 1833 at the age of\r\ntwenty. Four years later (1837) he published “The System of Mineralogy,”\r\na volume of 580 pages. The appearance of this book was an event of\r\nsurpassing importance in the development of the science. The book, of\r\ncourse, depended largely upon the previous works of Haüy, Mohs, Naumann\r\nand other European mineralogists, but was in no sense merely a\r\ncompilation from them. Dana, particularly in his discussion of\r\nmathematical crystallography, showed much original thought. He also\r\nproved his originality by proposing and using an elaborate system of\r\nclassification patterned after those already in use in the sciences of\r\nbotany and zoology. He later became convinced of the undesirability of\r\nthis method of classification and abandoned it entirely in the fourth\r\nedition of the System, published in 1854, substituting for it the\r\nchemical classification which, in its essential features, is in general\r\nuse to-day. The System of Mineralogy started in this way in 1837, has\r\ncontinued by means of successive editions to be the standard reference\r\nbook in the subject. The various editions appeared as follows: I, 1837;\r\nII, 1844; III, 1850; IV, 1854; V, 1868; VI, 1892 (by Edward S. Dana).\r\n\r\nJ. D. Dana also contributed numerous mineralogical articles to the first\r\nseries of volumes of the Journal. It is interesting to note that they\r\nare chiefly concerned with the more theoretical aspects of the subject,\r\nin fact they constitute practically the only articles of such a\r\ncharacter that appeared during this period. Among the subjects treated\r\nwere crystallographic symbols, formation of twin crystals;\r\npseudomorphism, origin of minerals in metamorphosed limestones, origin\r\nof serpentine, classification of minerals, etc.\r\n\r\nThe volumes of the Second Series of the Journal covered the years from\r\n1846 through 1870. This period was characterized by great activity in\r\nthe study of the chemical composition of minerals. A number of skilled\r\nchemists, notably J. Lawrence Smith, George J. Brush and Frederick A.\r\nGenth, began about 1850 a long series of chemical investigations of\r\nAmerican minerals. Very few articles during this time paid much\r\nattention to the physical properties of the minerals under discussion,\r\npractically no description of optical characters was attempted, and only\r\noccasionally were the crystals of a mineral mentioned. J. D. Dana was\r\nalmost the only writer who constantly endeavored to discover the\r\nfundamental characters and relationships in minerals. He published many\r\narticles in these years which were concerned chiefly with the\r\nclassification and grouping of minerals, with similarities in the\r\ncrystal forms of different species, with relations between chemical\r\ncomposition and crystal form, chemical formulas, mineral nomenclature,\r\netc. The following titles give an idea of the character of the more\r\nimportant series of articles by him which belong to this category: On\r\nthe isomorphism and atomic volume of some minerals (=9=, 220, 1850);\r\nvarious notes and articles on homœomorphism of minerals (=17=, 85, 86,\r\n210, 430; =18=, 35, 131, 1854); on a connection between crystalline form\r\nand chemical constitution, with some inferences therefrom (=44=, 89,\r\n252, 398, 1867).\r\n\r\nA great many new mineral names were proposed between 1850 and 1870, a\r\nlarge number of which have continued to be well-recognized species. But\r\nthere was also a tendency, which has not wholly disappeared even now, to\r\nbase a mineral determination upon insufficient evidence, and to propose\r\na new species with but little justification for it. In this connection a\r\nquotation from the introduction by J. D. Dana to the 3rd Supplement to\r\nthe System of Mineralogy (4th edition) published in the Journal (=22=,\r\npage 246, 1856), will be of interest. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “It is a matter of regret, that mineral species are so often brought\r\n  out, especially in this country, without sufficient investigation and\r\n  full description. It is not meeting the just demands of the science of\r\n  mineralogy to say that a mineral has probably certain constituents, or\r\n  to state the composition in a general way without a complete and\r\n  detailed analysis, especially when there are no crystallographic\r\n  characters to afford the species a good foundation. We have a right to\r\n  demand that those who name species, should use all the means the\r\n  science of the age admits of, to prove that the species is one that\r\n  nature will own, for only such belong to science, and if enough of the\r\n  material has not been found for a good description there is not enough\r\n  to authorize the introduction of a new name in the science. The\r\n  publication of factitious species, in whatever department of science,\r\n  is progress not towards truth, but into regions of error; and often\r\n  much and long labor is required before the science recovers from these\r\n  backward steps.”\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. Lawrence Smith was born in 1818 and died in 1883. He was a graduate\r\nof the University of Virginia and of the Medical College of Charleston\r\nand later spent three years studying in Paris. Shortly after the\r\ncompletion of his studies he went to Turkey as an advisor to the\r\ngovernment of that country in connection with the growing of cotton\r\nthere. During this time he investigated the emery mines of Asia Minor,\r\nand wrote a memoir upon them which was later published by the French\r\nAcademy. He served as professor of chemistry in the University of\r\nVirginia and later held the same chair in the University of Illinois. He\r\npublished a long series of papers on the chemical composition of\r\nminerals and meteorites, as well as on pure chemical subjects. Among the\r\nmore notable of his contributions are the “Memoir on Emery” (1850), a\r\nseries of papers on the “Reëxamination of American Minerals” (1853)\r\nwritten with the collaboration of George J. Brush, and his “Memoir on\r\nMeteorites” (1855).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ge. J. Brush]\r\n\r\nGeorge J. Brush entered on his scientific career at the moment when\r\nscience and scientific methods of research were just beginning to be\r\nappreciated in this country, and he soon became one of the leading\r\npioneers in the movement. While his half century of active service was\r\nlargely occupied by administrative duties in connection with the\r\nSheffield Scientific School, his interest in mineralogy never flagged.\r\nHis papers on mineralogical subjects number about thirty, all of which\r\nwere published in the Journal. These began in 1849, even before his\r\ngraduation from college, and continued until his last paper (in\r\ncollaboration with S. L. Penfield) appeared in 1883. Three of the early\r\npapers were written with J. Lawrence Smith as noted above. These papers\r\nfirst set in this country the standard for thorough and accurate\r\nscientific mineral investigation. Later in life he was active in the\r\ndevelopment of the remarkable mineral locality at Branchville, Conn.,\r\nand, with the collaboration of E. S. Dana, published in the Journal\r\n(1878–90) five important articles on its minerals. This locality, with\r\nthe exception of the zinc deposits at Franklin Furnace, N. J., was the\r\nmost remarkable yet discovered in this country. Nearly forty different\r\nmineral species were found there, of which nine (mostly phosphates) were\r\nnew to science. There has certainly been no other series of descriptive\r\npapers on a mineralogical locality of equal importance published in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn addition to publishing original papers, Brush did considerable\r\neditorial work in connection with the fourth (1854) and fifth (1868)\r\neditions of the System of Mineralogy and the Appendices to them. His\r\nManual of Determinative Mineralogy, with a series of determinative\r\ntables adapted from similar ones by von Kobell, was first published in\r\n1874. It was revised in 1878 and later rewritten by S. L. Penfield. This\r\nbook did much to make possible the rapid and accurate determination of\r\nmineral species. Throughout his life, Brush was an enthusiastic\r\ncollector of minerals, building up the notable collection that now bears\r\nhis name. Perhaps, however, his most important contribution to the\r\ndevelopment of mineralogy in America lay rather in his influence upon\r\nhis many students. With his enthusiasm for accurate and painstaking\r\ninvestigation he was an inspiration to all who came in contact with him\r\nand his own field and science in general owes much to that influence.\r\n\r\nAmong the early mineralogists in this country, who were concerned in the\r\nchemical analyses of minerals, none accomplished more or better work\r\nthan Frederick A. Genth. He was born in Germany in 1820 and lived in\r\nthat country until 1848, when he came to the United States and settled\r\nin Philadelphia. He had studied in various German universities and\r\nworked under some of the most famous chemists of that time. His papers\r\nin mineralogy number more than seventy-five, in the great majority of\r\nwhich chemical analyses are given. He published fifty-four successive\r\narticles, the greater part of which appeared in the Journal, which were\r\nentitled Contributions to Mineralogy. In these he gave descriptions of\r\nmore than two hundred different minerals, most of which were accompanied\r\nby analyses. He described more than a dozen new and well-established\r\nmineral species. He was especially interested in the rarer elements and\r\nmany of his analyses were of minerals containing them. Especially\r\ninteresting was his work with the tellurides, the species coloradoite,\r\nmelonite and calaverite being first described by him. A long and\r\nimportant investigation was recorded on Corundum, “Its Alterations and\r\nAssociate Minerals,” published in the Proceedings of the American\r\nPhilosophical Society in 1873 (=13=, 361). Dr. Genth died in 1893.\r\n\r\nThe period from 1860 until 1875 was not very productive in mineralogical\r\ninvestigations. The first ten volumes of the Third Series of the\r\nJournal, covering the years 1871–1876, contained mineralogical articles\r\nby only some fifteen different authors. But from that time on, the\r\namount of work done and the number of investigators grew rapidly. With\r\nthis increase in activity came also a decided change in the character of\r\nthe work. The period between 1871 and 1895 can be characterized as one\r\nin which all the various aspects of mineral investigation received more\r\nnearly equal prominence. While the chemical composition of minerals\r\nstill held rightly its prominent place, the investigation of the\r\ncrystallographic and optical characters and the relationships existing\r\nbetween all three were of much more frequent occurrence. Edward S. Dana\r\ncommenced his scientific work by publishing in 1872 an article on the\r\ncrystals of datolite which was probably the first American article\r\nconcerned wholly with the description of the crystallography of a\r\nmineral. Samuel L. Penfield began his important investigations in 1877\r\nand the first articles by Frank W. Clarke appeared during this period.\r\nThe first edition of the Text Book of Mineralogy by Edward S. Dana with\r\nits important chapters on Crystallography and Optical Mineralogy was\r\npublished in 1877 and his revision of the System of Mineralogy (sixth\r\nedition) appeared in 1892.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably the foremost figure in American mineralogy during this\r\nperiod was that of Samuel L. Penfield. He embodied in an unusual degree\r\nthe characters making for success in this science, for few investigators\r\nin mineralogy have shown, as he did, equal facility in all branches of\r\ndescriptive mineralogy. He was a skilled chemist and possessed in a high\r\ndegree that ingenuity in manipulation so necessary to a great analyst.\r\nHe was also an accurate and resourceful crystallographer and optical\r\nmineralogist. His contributions to the science of mineralogy can be\r\npartially judged by the following brief summary of his work. He\r\npublished over eighty mineralogical papers, practically all of which\r\nwere printed in the Journal. These included the descriptions of fourteen\r\nnew mineral species, the establishment of the chemical composition of\r\nmore than twenty others, and the crystallization of about a dozen more.\r\nBy a series of brilliant investigations he established the isomorphism\r\nbetween fluorine and the hydroxyl radical. He first enunciated the\r\ntheory that the crystalline form of a mineral was due to the mass effect\r\nof the acid present rather than that of the bases. He contributed also a\r\nnumber of articles on the stereographic projection and its use in\r\ncrystallographic investigations, devising a series of protractors and\r\nscales to make possible the rapid and accurate use of this projection in\r\nsolving problems in crystallography.\r\n\r\nPenfield was born in 1856, was graduated from the Sheffield Scientific\r\nSchool in 1877 and immediately became an assistant in the chemical\r\nlaboratory of that institution. At this time he, together with his\r\ncolleague Horace L. Wells, made the analyses of the minerals from the\r\nnewly discovered Branchville locality. He spent the years 1880 and 1881\r\nin studying chemistry in Germany, returning to Yale as an instructor in\r\nmineralogy in the fall of 1881. Except for another semester in Europe at\r\nHeidelberg he continued as instructor and professor of mineralogy in the\r\nSheffield Scientific School until his early death in 1906.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to choose for mention the names of other investigators\r\nin Mineralogy during this period. Toward its end a great many writers\r\ncontributed to the pages of the Journal, more than fifty different names\r\nbeing counted for the volumes =41= to =50= of the Third Series. Many of\r\nthese are still living and still active in scientific research. Mention\r\nshould be made of Frank W. Clarke, who contributed many important\r\narticles concerning the chemical constitution of the silicates. His work\r\non the mica and zeolite groups is especially noteworthy. The work of W.\r\nH. Hillebrand, particularly in regard to his analytical investigations\r\nof the minerals containing the rarer elements, was of great importance.\r\nThe name of W. E. Hidden should be remembered, because, with his keen\r\nand discriminating eye and active search for new mineral localities, he\r\nwas able to make many additions to the science.\r\n\r\nIn glancing over the indices to the Journal the close interrelation of\r\nmineralogy to the other sciences is strikingly shown by the fact that so\r\nmany scientists whose particular fields are along other lines have\r\npublished occasional mineralogical papers. Frequently a young man has\r\ncommenced with mineralogical investigations and then later been drawn\r\ndefinitely into one of these allied subjects. Men, who have won their\r\nreputation in chemistry, physics, and all the various divisions of\r\ngeology, even that of palaeontology, have all contributed articles\r\ndistinctly mineralogical in character. For this reason the number of\r\nAmerican writers who have published what may be called casual papers on\r\nmineralogy is very great in comparison to the number of those who\r\ncontinue such publications over a series of years.\r\n\r\nThat the subject of meteorites is one which has been constantly studied\r\nby American mineralogists and petrographers is shown by the long list of\r\npapers concerning it that have been published in the Journal; it should,\r\ntherefore, be considered briefly here. Many of these papers are short\r\nand of a general descriptive nature but others which give more fully the\r\nchemical, mineralogical and physical details are numerous. Among the\r\nearlier writers on this subject Benjamin Silliman, Jr., and C. U.\r\nShepard should be mentioned. The latter was the first to recognize a new\r\nmineral in the Bishopville meteorite which he called chladnite. The same\r\nsubstance was afterwards found in a terrestial occurrence and was more\r\naccurately described by Kenngott under the name of enstatite. J.\r\nLawrence Smith later showed that these two substances were identical.\r\nSmith did a large amount of important chemical work on meteorites. He\r\nwas the first to note the presence of ferrous chloride in meteoric iron,\r\nthe mineral being afterwards named lawrencite in his honor. The\r\niron-chronium sulphide, daubreelite, was also first described by him.\r\nOther names that should be mentioned in this connection are those of A.\r\nW. Wright who studied the gaseous constituents of meteorites, G. F.\r\nKunz, W. E. Hidden, A. E. Foote and H. A. Ward, all of whom published\r\nnumerous descriptions of these bodies. Among the more recent workers in\r\nthis field the names of G. P. Merrill and O. C. Farrington deserve\r\nespecial mention.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the Fourth Series of the Journal began in 1896.\r\nAlthough the years since then have seen a great amount of very important\r\nwork accomplished, the history of the period is fresh in the minds of\r\nall and as the majority of the active workers are still living and\r\nproductive it seems hardly necessary to go into great detail concerning\r\nit. Twenty years ago it seemed to some mineralogists that the science\r\ncould almost be considered complete. All the commoner minerals had\r\ncertainly been discovered and exhaustively studied. Little apparently\r\nwas left that could be added to our knowledge of them. New occurrences\r\nwould still be recorded, new crystal habits would be observed, and an\r\noccasional new and small crystal face might be listed, but few facts of\r\ngreat importance seemed undiscovered. This view was not wholly justified\r\nbecause new facts of interest and importance have continuously been\r\nbrought forward, and the finding of new minerals does not appear to\r\ndiminish in amount with the years. The work of the investigators on the\r\nUnited States Geological Survey along these lines is especially\r\nnoteworthy.\r\n\r\nThis last of our periods, however, is chiefly signalized by a\r\npractically new development along the lines that might be characterized\r\nas experimental mineralogy. New ways have been discovered in which to\r\nstudy minerals. The important but hitherto baffling problems of their\r\ngenesis, together with their relations to their surroundings, and to\r\nassociated minerals, have been attacked by novel methods.\r\n\r\nIn this pioneer work that of the Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie\r\nInstitution of Washington has been of the greatest importance. This\r\nlaboratory was established in 1905 and, under the directorship of Arthur\r\nL. Day, a notable corps of investigators has been assembled and\r\nremarkable work already accomplished. While the field of investigation\r\nof the laboratory is broader than that of mineralogy, including much\r\nthat belongs to petrography, vulcanology, etc., still the greater part\r\nof the work done can be properly classed as mineralogical in character\r\nand should be considered here. Because of its great value, however, it\r\nwas felt that an authoritative, although necessarily, under existing\r\nconditions, a brief, account of it should be given. A concise summary of\r\nthe objects, methods and results of the investigations of the laboratory\r\nhas been kindly prepared by a member of its staff, Dr. R. B. Sosman, and\r\nis given later.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years another line of investigation has been opened\r\nby the discovery of the effect of crystalline structure upon X-rays.\r\nThrough the refraction or reflection of the X-ray by means of the\r\nordered arrangement of the particles forming the crystalline network, we\r\nare apparently going to be able to discover much concerning the internal\r\nstructure of crystals. And, partly through these discoveries, is likely\r\nto come in turn the solution of the hitherto insolvable mystery of the\r\nconstitution of matter. Without doubt the multitudinous facts of\r\nmineralogy assembled during the past century by the painstaking\r\ninvestigation of a large number of scientists are destined to play a\r\nlarge part in the solution of this problem. Further, it does not seem\r\ntoo bold a prophecy to suggest, that the time will come when it will be\r\npossible to assemble all these unorganized facts that we know about\r\nminerals into a harmonious whole and that we shall be then able to\r\nformulate the underlying and fundamental principles upon which they all\r\ndepend. These are the great problems for the future of mineralogical\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IX\r\n THE WORK OF THE GEOPHYSICAL LABORATORY OF THE CARNEGIE INSTITUTION OF\r\n                               WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n                            By R. B. SOSMAN\r\n\r\n\r\n There are three methods of approach to the great problem of rock\r\nformation. The first undertakes to reproduce by suitable laboratory\r\nexperiments some of the observed changes in natural rocks. The second\r\nseeks to apply the principles of physical chemistry to a great body of\r\ncarefully gathered statistics. The third method of attack is like the\r\nfirst in being a laboratory method, and like the second in seeking to\r\napply existing knowledge to the association of minerals as found in\r\nrocks, but in its procedure differs widely from both. It consists of\r\nbringing together pure materials under measurable conditions, and thus\r\nin establishing by strictly quantitative methods the relations in which\r\nminerals can exist together under the conditions of temperature and\r\npressure that have the power to affect such relations.\r\n\r\nIt is to this third method of investigation of the problems of the rocks\r\nthat the Geophysical Laboratory has been devoted since its establishment\r\nin 1905. It has proved entirely practicable to make quantitative studies\r\nof the relations among the principal earth-forming oxides (silica,\r\nalumina, magnesia, lime, soda, potash, and the oxides of iron) over a\r\nvery wide range of temperatures. The resources of physics have proved\r\nadequate to establish temperature with a high degree of precision and to\r\nmeasure the quantity of energy involved in the various reactions. The\r\nchemist has been able to obtain materials in a high degree of purity,\r\nand to follow out in detail the chemical relationships that exist among\r\nthe earth-forming oxides. The petrographic laboratory has been available\r\nfor the comparison of synthetic laboratory products with the\r\ncorresponding natural minerals.\r\n\r\nIt has also proved entirely practicable to extend the same methods of\r\nresearch to some of the principal ore minerals such as the sulphides of\r\ncopper. Other information which is certain to be of ultimate economic\r\nvalue has also come out of the thorough study of the silicates, which\r\nare basic materials for the vast variety of industries which are classed\r\nunder the name of ceramic industries. The best example of this is the\r\nfacility with which the experience and the personnel of the laboratory\r\nhas been adapted to the very important problem of manufacturing an\r\nadequate supply of optical glass for the needs of the United States in\r\nthe present war.\r\n\r\nIt has further been possible to show within the last two years that rock\r\nformation in which volatile ingredients play a necessary and determining\r\npart can be completely studied in the laboratory with as much precision\r\nas though all the components were solids or liquids.\r\n\r\nAlong with the laboratory work on the formation of minerals and rocks\r\nhas gone an increasing amount of field work on the activities of\r\naccessible volcanoes, such as Kilauea and Vesuvius, where the fusion and\r\nrecrystallization of rocks on a large scale can be observed and studied.\r\n\r\nThere was once a time when the confidence of the laboratory in the\r\ncapacity of physics and chemistry to solve geological problems was not\r\nshared by all geologists. There were some who were inclined to view with\r\nconsiderable apprehension the vast ramifications and complications of\r\nnatural rock formation as a problem impossible of adequate solution in\r\nthe laboratory. It is, therefore, a matter of satisfaction to all those\r\nwho have participated in these efforts to see the evidences of this\r\napprehension disappearing gradually as the work has progressed. A\r\ncareful appraisement of the situation to-day, after ten years of\r\nactivity, reveals the fact that the tangible grounds for anxiety about\r\nthe _accessibility_ of the problems which were confronted at first are\r\nnow for the most part dissipated.\r\n\r\nIt will not be possible to review in detail the lines of work sketched\r\nabove. An outline of the synthetic work on systems of the mineral oxides\r\nand a paragraph on the volcano researches will perhaps suffice to\r\nindicate the general plan and purpose of the laboratory’s work. It\r\nshould be added that the results of many of the researches of the\r\nlaboratory, detailed below, have been published in the pages of the\r\nJournal (see =21=, 89, 1906, and later volumes).\r\n\r\n_Mineral Researches._—The mineral studies include:\r\n\r\nI. _One-component systems_: silica, with its numerous polymorphic forms\r\nand their relations to temperature and the conditions of rock formation;\r\nalumina; magnesia; and lime.\r\n\r\nII. _Two-component systems_: silica-alumina, including sillimanite and\r\nrelated minerals; silica-magnesia, including the tetramorphic\r\nmetasilicate MgSiO_{3}; silica-lime, including wollastonite; the alkali\r\nsilicates, particularly with reference to their equilibria with carbon\r\ndioxide and with water; ferric oxide-lime; alumina-lime;\r\nalumina-magnesia, including spinel; and hematite-magnetite, a\r\nsolid-solution series of an unusual type.\r\n\r\nIII. _Three-component systems_: silica-alumina-magnesia, completed but\r\nnot yet published; silica-alumina-lime, complete, including the\r\ncompounds that enter into the composition of portland cement;\r\nsilica-magnesia-lime, completed but not yet published, including,\r\nhowever, published work on the diopside-forsterite-silica system, and on\r\nthe CaSiO_{3}-MgSiO_{3} series; and alumina-magnesia-lime.\r\n\r\nIV. _Four components_: SiO_{2}-Al_{2}O_{3}-MgO-CaO: the incomplete\r\nsystem anorthite-forsterite-silica; SiO_{2}-Al_{2}O_{3}-CaO-Na_{2}O: the\r\nseries of lime-soda feldspars (albite-anorthite), and the series\r\nnephelite (carnegieite)-anorthite; SiO_{2}-Al_{2}O_{3}-Na_{2}O-K_{2}O:\r\nthe sodium-potassium nephelites.\r\n\r\nV. _Five components_: SiO_{2}-Al_{2}O_{3}-MgO-CaO-Na_{2}O: the ternary\r\nsystem diopside-anorthite-albite (haplo-basaltic and haplo-dioritic\r\nmagmas).\r\n\r\nFairly complete studies have also been made of the mineral sulphides of\r\niron, copper, zinc, cadmium, and mercury, and the conditions controlling\r\nthe secondary enrichment of copper sulphide ores are now being\r\ninvestigated. In connection with the sulphide investigations, the\r\nhydrated oxides of iron have been studied chemically and microscopically\r\nand the results will soon be ready for publication.\r\n\r\nThroughout the work the mere accumulation of bodies of facts has been\r\nheld to be secondary in importance to the development of new methods of\r\nattack and the evaluation of new general principles, and the specific\r\nproblems studied have been selected from this point of view.\r\n\r\n_Volcano Researches._—A branch of the laboratory’s work that is of\r\ngeneral as well as petrological interest is the study of active\r\nvolcanoes. Observations and collections have been made at Kilauea,\r\nVesuvius, Etna, Stromboli, Vulcano, and (through the courtesy of the\r\ndirectors of the National Geographic Society) Katmai in Alaska. The\r\ngreat importance of gases in volcanicity is emphasized by all the\r\nstudies. The active gases include hydrogen and water vapor, carbon\r\nmonoxide and carbon dioxide, and sulphur and its oxides, as well as a\r\nvariety of other compounds of lesser importance. The crater of Kilauea\r\nproves to be an active natural gas-furnace, in which reactions are\r\ncontinuously occurring among the gases, often resulting in making the\r\nlava basin hotter at the surface than it is at some depth. These\r\nreactions are being studied in the laboratory on mixtures of the pure\r\nconstituent gases in known proportions, in order to lay the foundation\r\nfor accurate interpretation and prediction concerning the gases as\r\nactually collected from the volcanoes themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   X\r\n      THE PROGRESS OF CHEMISTRY DURING THE PAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS\r\n\r\n                 By HORACE L. WELLS and HARRY W. FOOTE\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Introduction._\r\n\r\nAs we look back to the time of the founding of the Journal in 1818, we\r\nsee that the science of chemistry had recently made and was then making\r\ngreat advances. That the scientific men of those days were much\r\nimpressed with what was being accomplished is well shown by the\r\nfollowing statement made in an early number of the Journal (=3=, 330,\r\n1821) by its founder in reviewing Gorham’s Elements of Chemical Science.\r\nHe says: “The present period is distinguished by wonderful mental\r\nactivity; it might indeed be denominated as the intellectual age of the\r\nworld. At no former period has the mind of man been directed at one time\r\nto so many and so useful researches.”\r\n\r\nA very remarkable revolution in chemical ideas had recently taken place.\r\nSoon after the discovery of oxygen by Priestley in 1774, and the\r\nsubsequent discovery by Cavendish that water was formed by the\r\ncombustion of hydrogen and oxygen, Lavoisier had explained combustion in\r\ngeneral as oxidation, thus overthrowing the curious old phlogiston\r\ntheory which had prevailed as the basis of chemical philosophy for\r\nnearly a century.\r\n\r\nThe era of modern chemistry had thus begun, and the additional views\r\nthat matter was indestructible and that chemical compounds were of\r\nconstant composition had been generally accepted at the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nDalton had announced his atomic theory in 1802, having based it largely\r\nupon the law of multiple proportions which he had previously discovered,\r\nand he had begun to express the formulas for compounds in terms of\r\natomic symbols.\r\n\r\nIn 1808 Gay-Lussac had discovered his law of gas combination in simple\r\nproportions,[153] a law of supreme importance in connection with the\r\natomic theory, but neither he nor Dalton had seen this theoretical\r\nconnection. Avogadro had understood it, however, and in 1811 had reached\r\nthe momentous conclusion that all gases and vapors have equal numbers of\r\nmolecules in equal volumes at the same temperature and pressure.\r\n\r\nDavy in 1807 had isolated the alkali-metals, sodium and potassium, by\r\nmeans of electrolysis, thus practically dispelling the view that certain\r\nearthy substances might be elementary; and about four years later he had\r\ndemonstrated that chlorine was an element, not an oxide as had been\r\nsupposed previously, thus overthrowing Lavoisier’s view that oxygen was\r\nthe characteristic constituent of all acids.\r\n\r\nAt the time that our period of history begins, the atomic theory had\r\nbeen accepted generally, but in a somewhat indefinite form, since little\r\nattention had been paid to Avogadro’s principle, and since Dalton had\r\nused only the principle of greatest simplicity in writing the formulas\r\nof compounds, considering water as HO and ammonia NH, for example. At\r\nthis time, however, Berzelius for ten or fifteen years had been devoting\r\ntremendous energy to the task of determining the atomic weights of\r\nnearly all of the elements then known by analyzing their compounds. He\r\nhad confirmed the law of multiple proportions, accepted the atomic\r\ntheory, and utilized Avogadro’s principle, and it is an interesting\r\ncoincidence that his first table of atomic weights was published in the\r\nyear 1818.\r\n\r\nAn interesting account of the views on chemistry held at about that time\r\nwas published in the Journal by Denison Olmsted (=11=, 349, 1826; =12=,\r\n1, 1827), who had recently become professor of natural philosophy in\r\nYale College.\r\n\r\nThe most illustrious European chemists of that time were Berzelius of\r\nSweden, Davy of England, and Gay-Lussac of France, and the curious\r\ncircumstance may be mentioned that all three of them and also Benjamin\r\nSilliman, the founder of the Journal, were born within a period of eight\r\nmonths in 1778–1779.\r\n\r\nIn this country Robert Hare of Philadelphia and Benjamin Silliman were\r\nundoubtedly the most prominent chemists of those days. Hare is best\r\nknown for his invention of the compound blowpipe, but his contributions\r\nto the Journal were very numerous, beginning almost with the first\r\nvolume and continuing for over thirty years. Among the first of these\r\ncontributions was a most vigorous but well-merited attack upon a Doctor\r\nClark of Cambridge, England, who had copied his invention without giving\r\nhim proper credit. He begins (=2=, 281, 1820) by saying: “Dr. Clark has\r\npublished a book on the gas blowpipe in which he professes a sincere\r\ndesire to render everyone his due. That it would be difficult for the\r\nconduct of any author to be more discordant with these professions, I\r\npledge myself to prove in the following pages.”\r\n\r\nHare also invented a galvanic battery which he called a “deflagrator,”\r\nconsisting of a large number of single cells in series. With this, using\r\ncarbon electrodes, he was able to obtain a higher temperature than with\r\nhis oxy-hydrogen blowpipe. He was the first to apply galvanic ignition\r\nto blasting (=21=, 139, 1832), and he first carried out electrolyses\r\nwith the use of mercury as the cathode (=37=, 267, 1839). In this way he\r\nprepared metallic calcium and other metals from solutions of their\r\nchlorides, while the principle employed by him has in recent times been\r\nused as the basis of a very important process for manufacturing caustic\r\npotash and soda.\r\n\r\nSilliman, who had become an intimate friend of Hare during two periods\r\nof chemical study under Woodhouse in Philadelphia in 1802–1804, and who\r\nsoon afterwards spent fourteen months as a student abroad, chiefly in\r\nEngland and Scotland, took a broad interest in science and gave much\r\nattention to geology as well as to chemistry. In spite of this divided\r\ninterest and his work as a teacher, popular scientific lecturer, and\r\neditor, he found time for a surprising amount of original chemical work.\r\nFor instance, using Hare’s deflagrator, he showed that carbon was\r\nvolatilized in the electric arc (=5=, 108, 1822); he was the first in\r\nthis country to prepare hydrofluoric acid (=6=, 354, 1823), and he first\r\ndetected bromine in one of our natural brines (=18=, 142, 1830).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Atomic Weights._\r\n\r\nAs soon as the atomic theory was accepted, the relative weights of the\r\natoms became a matter of vital importance in connection with formulas\r\nand chemical calculations. In advancing his theory, Dalton had made some\r\nvery rough atomic weight determinations, and it has been mentioned\r\nalready that Berzelius, at the time that our historical period begins,\r\nwas engaged in the prodigious task of accurately determining these\r\nconstants for nearly all the known elements. It is recorded that he\r\nanalyzed quantitatively no less than two thousand compounds in\r\nconnection with this work during his career. His table of 1818 has\r\nproved to be remarkably accurate for that pioneer period, and it\r\nindicates his remarkable skill as an analyst.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that Berzelius in this early table made use of\r\nAvogadro’s principle in connection with elements forming gaseous\r\ncompounds, and thus obtained correct formulas and atomic weights in such\r\ncases, but that in many instances his atomic weights and those now\r\naccepted bear the relation of simple multiples to one another, because\r\nhe had then no means of deciding upon the formulas of many compounds\r\nexcept the rule of assumed simplicity. For example, the two oxides of\r\niron now considered to be FeO and Fe_{2}O_{3} he regarded as FeO_{2} and\r\nFeO_{3}, knowing as he did that the ratio of oxygen in them was 2 to 3,\r\nand believing that a single atom of iron in each was the simplest view\r\nof the case, so that as the consequence of these formulas the atomic\r\nweight of iron was then considered to be practically twice as great in\r\nits relation to oxygen as at present.\r\n\r\nThese old atomic weights of Berzelius, used with the corresponding\r\nformulas, were just as serviceable for calculating compositions and\r\nanalytical factors as though the correct multiples had been selected. As\r\ntime went on, the true multiples were gradually found from\r\nconsiderations of atomic heats, isomorphism, vapor densities, the\r\nperiodic law, and so on, and suitable changes were made in the chemical\r\nformulas.\r\n\r\nBerzelius used 100 parts of oxygen as the basis of his atomic weights, a\r\npractice which was generally followed for several decades. Dalton,\r\nhowever, had originally used hydrogen as unity as the basis, and this\r\nplan finally came into use everywhere, as it seemed to be more logical\r\nand convenient, because hydrogen has the smallest atomic weight, and\r\nalso because the atomic weights of a number of common elements appeared\r\nto be exact multiples of that of hydrogen, thus giving simpler numbers\r\nfor use in calculations.\r\n\r\nWithin a few years a slight change has been made by the adoption of\r\noxygen as exactly 16 as the basis, which gives hydrogen the value of\r\n1·008.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1815, Prout, an English physician, had advanced the view\r\nthat hydrogen is the primordial substance of all the elements, and\r\nconsequently that the atomic weights are all exact multiples of that of\r\nhydrogen. This hypothesis has been one of the incentives to\r\ninvestigations upon atomic weights, for it has been found that these\r\nconstants in the cases of a considerable number of the elements are very\r\nclose to whole numbers when based upon hydrogen as unity, or even still\r\ncloser when based upon oxygen as 16.\r\n\r\nWith our present knowledge Prout’s hypothesis may be regarded as\r\ndisproved for nearly all the elements whose atomic weights have been\r\naccurately determined, but the close or even exact agreement with it in\r\na few cases is still worthy of consideration. There is an interesting\r\nletter from Berzelius to B. Silliman, Jr., in the Journal (=48=, 369,\r\n1845) in which Berzelius considers the theory entirely disproved.\r\n\r\nFor a long time entire reliance was placed upon the atomic weights\r\nobtained by Berzelius, but it came to be observed that the calculation\r\nof carbon from carbon dioxide appeared to give high results in certain\r\ncases, so that doubt arose as to the accuracy of Berzelius’s work.\r\nConsequently in 1840 Dumas, assisted by his pupil Stas, made a new\r\ndetermination of the atomic weight of carbon, and found that the number\r\nobtained by Berzelius, 12·12, was slightly too large. Subsequently Dumas\r\ndetermined more than twenty other atomic weights, but this great amount\r\nof work did not bring about any considerable improvement, for it appears\r\nthat Dumas did not greatly excel Berzelius in accuracy, and that the\r\nlatter had made one of his most noticeable errors in connection with\r\ncarbon.\r\n\r\nSoon after assisting Dumas in the work upon carbon, Stas began his very\r\nextensive and accurate, independent determinations, leading to the\r\npublication of a book in 1867 describing his work. Stas made many\r\nimprovements in methods by the use of great care in purifying the\r\nsubstances employed, and especially by using large quantities of\r\nmaterial in his determinations, thus diminishing the proportional errors\r\nin weighing. His results, which dealt with most of the common elements,\r\nwere accepted with much confidence by chemists everywhere.\r\n\r\nStas reached the conclusion that there could be no real foundation for\r\nProut’s hypothesis, since so many of his atomic weights varied from\r\nwhole numbers, and this opinion has been generally accepted.\r\n\r\nThe first accurate atomic weight determination published in the Journal\r\nwas that by Mallett on lithium (=22=, 349, 1856; =28=, 349, 1859),\r\nshowing a result almost identical with that accepted at the present\r\ntime. Johnson and Allen’s determination (=35=, 94, 1863) on the rare\r\nelement cæsium was carried out with extraordinary accuracy. Lee, working\r\nwith Wolcott Gibbs, made good determinations on nickel and cobalt (=2=,\r\n44, 1871). The work of Cooke on antimony (=15=, 41, 107, 1878) was\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\nConcerning the more recent work published elsewhere than in the Journal,\r\nattention should be called particularly to the investigations that have\r\nbeen carried on for the past twenty-five years by Richards and his\r\nassociates at Harvard University. Richards has shown masterly ability in\r\nthe selection of methods and in avoiding errors. His results have\r\ndisplayed such marvelous agreements among repeated determinations by the\r\nsame and by different processes as to inspire the greatest confidence.\r\nHis work has been very extensive, and it is a great credit to our\r\ncountry that this atomic weight work, so superior to all that has been\r\npreviously done, is being carried out here.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned that for a number of years the decision in regard to\r\nthe atomic weights to be accepted has been in the hands of an\r\nInternational Committee of which our fellow countryman F. W. Clarke has\r\nbeen chairman. In connection with this position and previously, Clarke\r\nhas done valuable service in re-calculating and summarizing atomic\r\nweight determinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Analytical Chemistry._\r\n\r\nAnalysis is of such fundamental importance in nearly every other branch\r\nof chemical investigation that its development has been of the utmost\r\nimportance in connection with the advancement of the science. It\r\nattained, therefore, a comparatively early development, and one hundred\r\nyears ago it was in a flourishing condition, particularly as far as\r\ninorganic qualitative and gravimetric analysis were concerned. There is\r\nno doubt that Berzelius, whose atomic weight determinations have already\r\nbeen mentioned, surpassed all other analysts of that time in the amount,\r\nvariety, and accuracy of his gravimetric work. He lived through three\r\ndecades of our period, until 1848.\r\n\r\nDuring the past century there has been constant progress in inorganic\r\nanalysis, due to improved methods, better apparatus and accumulated\r\nexperience. An excellent work on this subject was published by H. Rose,\r\na pupil of Berzelius, and the methods of the latter, with many\r\nimprovements and additions by the author and others, were thus made\r\naccessible. Fresenius, who was born in 1818, did much service in\r\nestablishing a laboratory in which the teaching of analytical chemistry\r\nwas made a specialty, in writing text-books on the subject and in\r\nestablishing in 1862 the “Zeitschrift für analytische Chemie,” which has\r\ncontinued up to the present time.\r\n\r\nBesides Berzelius, who was the first to show that minerals were definite\r\nchemical compounds, there have been many prominent mineral analysts in\r\nEurope, among whom Rammelsberg and Bunsen may be mentioned, but there\r\ncame a time towards the end of the nineteenth century when the attention\r\nof chemists, particularly in Germany, was so much absorbed by organic\r\nchemistry that mineral analysis came near becoming a lost art there. It\r\nwas during that period that an English mineralogist, visiting New Haven\r\nand praising the mineral analyses that were being carried out at Yale,\r\nexpressed regret that there appeared to be no one in England, or in\r\nGermany either, who could analyze minerals.\r\n\r\nThe best analytical work done in this country in the early part of our\r\nperiod was chiefly in connection with mineral analysis, and a large\r\nshare of it was published in the Journal. Henry Seybert, of\r\nPhiladelphia, in particular, showed remarkable skill in this direction,\r\nand published numerous analyses of silicates and other minerals,\r\nbeginning in 1822. It was he who first detected boric acid in tourmaline\r\n(=6=, 155, 1822), and beryllium in chrysoberyl (=8=, 105, 1824). His\r\nmethods for silicate analyses were very similar to those used at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nJ. Lawrence Smith in 1853 described his method for determining alkalies\r\nin minerals (=16=, 53), a method which in its final form (=1=, 269,\r\n1871) is the best ever devised for the purpose. He also described (=15=,\r\n94, 1853) a very useful method, still largely used in analytical work,\r\nfor destroying ammonium salts by means of aqua regia. Carey Lea (=42=,\r\n109, 1866) described the well-known test for iodides by means of\r\npotassium dichromate. F. W. Clarke (=49=, 48, 1870) showed that antimony\r\nand arsenic could be quantitatively separated from tin by the\r\nprecipitation of the sulphides in the presence of oxalic acid. In 1864\r\nWolcott Gibbs (=37=, 346) began an important series of analytical notes\r\nfrom the Lawrence Scientific School, and he worked out later many\r\ndifficult analytical problems, particularly in connection with his\r\nextensive researches upon the complex inorganic acids.\r\n\r\nFrom 1850 on, Brush and his students made many important investigations\r\nupon minerals, and from 1877 Penfield (=13=, 425), beginning with an\r\nanalysis of a new mineral from Branchville, Connecticut, described by\r\nBrush and E. S. Dana, displayed remarkable skill and industry in this\r\nkind of work. Both of the writers of this article were fortunate in\r\nbeing associated with Penfield in some of his researches upon minerals\r\nand one of us began as he did with the Branchville work. It is probably\r\nfair to say that Penfield did the most accurate work in mineral analysis\r\nthat has ever been accomplished, and that he was similarly successful in\r\ncrystallography and other physical branches of mineralogy.\r\n\r\nThe American analytical investigations that have been mentioned were all\r\npublished in the Journal, with the exception of a part of Gibbs’s work.\r\nMany other American workers at mineral analysis might be alluded to\r\nhere, but only the excellent work of a number of chemists in the United\r\nStates Geological Survey will be mentioned. Among these Hillebrand\r\ndeserves particular praise for the extent of his investigations and for\r\nhis careful researches in improving the methods of rock analysis.\r\n\r\nTo our own Professor Gooch especial praise must be accorded for the very\r\nlarge number of analytical methods that have been devised, or critically\r\nstudied, by him and his students, and for the excellent quality of this\r\nwork. The publications in the Journal from his laboratory began in 1890\r\n(=39=, 188), and the extraordinary extent of this work is shown by the\r\nfact that the three hundredth paper from the Kent Laboratory appeared in\r\nMay, 1918. These very numerous and important investigations have been of\r\ngreat scientific and practical value, and they have formed a striking\r\nfeature of the Journal for nearly 30 years. In 1912 Gooch published his\r\n“Methods in Chemical Analysis,” a book of over 500 pages, in which the\r\nwork in the Kent Chemical Laboratory up to that time was concisely\r\npresented. Among the many workers who have assisted in these\r\ninvestigations, P. E. Browning, W. A. Drushel, F. S. Havens, D. A.\r\nKreider, C. A. Peters, I. K. Phelps and R. G. Van Name are particularly\r\nprominent. Besides many other useful pieces of apparatus, the perforated\r\nfiltering crucible was devised by Gooch, and this has brought his name\r\ninto everyday use in all chemical laboratories.\r\n\r\nVolumetric analysis was originated by Gay-Lussac, who described a method\r\nfor chlorimetry in 1824, for alkalimetry in 1828, and for the\r\ndetermination of silver and chlorides in 1832. Margueritte devised\r\ntitrations with potassium permanganate in 1846, while Bunsen, not far\r\nfrom the same time, introduced the use of iodine and sulphur dioxide\r\nsolutions for the purpose of determining many oxidations and reductions.\r\nWe owe to Mohr some improvements in apparatus and a German text-book on\r\nthe subject, while Sutton wrote an excellent English work on volumetric\r\nanalysis, of which many editions have appeared.\r\n\r\nWhile volumetric analysis began to be used less than one hundred years\r\nago, its applications have been gradually extended to a very great\r\ndegree, and it is not only exceedingly important in investigations in\r\npure chemistry, but its use is especially extensive in technical\r\nlaboratories where large numbers of rapid analyses are required.\r\n\r\nNot a few volumetric methods have been devised or improved in the United\r\nStates, but mention will be made here only of Cooke’s important method\r\nfor the determination of ferrous iron in insoluble silicates, published\r\nin the Journal (=44=, 347, 1867); to Penfield’s method for the\r\ndetermination of fluorine in 1878; and to the more recent general method\r\nof titration with an iodate in strong hydrochloric acid solutions, due\r\nto L. W. Andrews, a number of applications of which have been worked out\r\nin the Sheffield Laboratory.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of work with gases had been done by Priestley,\r\nScheele, Cavendish, Lavoisier, Dalton, Gay-Lussac, and others before our\r\nhundred-year period began. Cavendish, about 1780, had analyzed\r\natmospheric air with remarkable accuracy, and had even separated the\r\nargon from it and wondered what it was, and later Gay-Lussac had shown\r\ngreat skill in the study of gas reactions. During our period gas\r\nanalysis has been further developed by many chemists. Bunsen, in\r\nparticular, brought the art to a high degree of perfection in the course\r\nof a long period beginning about 1838, the last edition of his “Methods\r\nof Gas Analysis” having been published in 1877.\r\n\r\nImportant devices for the simplification of gas analysis in order that\r\nit might be used more conveniently for technical purposes have been\r\nintroduced by Orsat in France and by Winkler, Hempel and Bunte in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nIt appears that our countryman Morley has surpassed all others in\r\naccurate work with gases in connection with his determinations of the\r\ncombining weights and volumes of hydrogen and oxygen about the year\r\n1891. Some of his publications have appeared in the Journal (=30=, 140,\r\n1885; =41=, 220, 1891; and others).\r\n\r\nElectrolytic analysis, involving the deposition of metals, or sometimes\r\nof oxides, usually upon a platinum electrode, was brought into use in\r\n1865 by Wolcott Gibbs through an article published in the Journal (=39=,\r\n58, 1865). He there described the electrolytic precipitation of copper\r\nand of nickel by the methods still in use. The application of the\r\nprocess has been extended to a number of other metals, and it has been\r\nlargely employed, particularly in technical analyses. Important\r\ninvestigations and excellent books on this subject have been the\r\ncontributions of Edgar F. Smith of the University of Pennsylvania, and\r\nthe useful improvement, the rotating cathode, was devised by Gooch and\r\ndescribed in the Journal (=15=, 320, 1903).\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _General Inorganic Chemistry._\r\n\r\n_The Chemical Symbols._—It is to Berzelius that we owe our symbols for\r\nthe atoms, derived usually from their Latin names, such as C for carbon,\r\nNa for sodium, Cl for chlorine, Fe for iron, Ag for silver, and Au for\r\ngold. We owe to him also the use of small figures to show the number of\r\natoms in a formula, as in N_{2}O_{5}. This was a marked improvement over\r\nthe hieroglyphic symbols proposed by Dalton, which were set down as many\r\ntimes as the atoms were supposed to occur in formulas, forming groups of\r\ncurious appearance, but in some respects not unlike some of our modern\r\ndeveloped formulas. The advantages of Berzelius’s symbols were their\r\nsimplicity, legibility, and the fact that they could be printed without\r\nthe need of special type. It is true that at a later period Berzelius\r\nused certain symbols with horizontal lines crossing them to represent\r\ndouble atoms, and that these made some difficulty in printing. It should\r\nbe mentioned also that Berzelius at one time made an effort to simplify\r\nformulas by placing dots over other symbols to represent oxygen, and\r\ncommas to represent sulphur atoms. Examples of these are:\r\n\r\n               ĊaS⃛, calcium sulphate; F̋e, iron disulphide\r\n\r\nThis form of notation was quite extensively employed for a time,\r\nespecially by mineralogists, but it was entirely abandoned later.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice that Dalton, who lived until 1844, to reach\r\nthe age of 78, differed from other chemists in refusing to accept the\r\nletter-symbols of Berzelius. In a letter written to Graham in 1837 he\r\nsaid: “Berzelius’s symbols are horrifying. A young student in chemistry\r\nmight as soon learn Hebrew as to make himself acquainted with them. They\r\nappear like a chaos of atoms ... and to equally perplex the adepts of\r\nscience, to discourage the learner, as well as to cloud the beauty and\r\nsimplicity of the atomic theory.”\r\n\r\nThis forcibly expressed opinion was apparently tinged with self-esteem,\r\nbut there is no doubt that Dalton was sincere in believing that the\r\natoms were best represented by his circular symbols, because, as is well\r\nknown, he thought that all the atoms were spherical in form, and it is\r\nevident that circles give the proper picture of spherical objects. At\r\nthe present time some insight as to the structure of atoms is being\r\ngained, and it appears possible that the time may come when pictures of\r\ntheir external appearance that are not wholly imaginary may be made.\r\n\r\n_Changes in Formulas._—Even before the year 1826, Berzelius displayed\r\ngreat skill in arriving at many formulas that agree with our present\r\nones, for example, H_{2}O for water, ZnCl_{2} for zinc chloride,\r\nN_{2}O_{5} for nitric acid (anhydride), CaO for calcium oxide, CO and\r\nCO_{2} for the oxides of carbon, and many others. But at the same period\r\nother authorities, especially Gay-Lussac in France and Gmelin in\r\nGermany, on account of a lack of appreciation for Avogadro’s principle\r\nand for other reasons, such as the use of symbols to represent combining\r\nweights rather than atoms, were using different formulas for some of\r\nthese compounds, such as HO, ZnCl and NO_{5}, so that their formulas for\r\nmany of the compounds of hydrogen, chlorine, nitrogen and several other\r\nelements differed from those of Berzelius. The employment of different\r\nformulas involved the use of different atomic or combining weights. For\r\nexample, with the formula H_{2}O for water the composition by weight\r\nrequires the ratio 1 to 16 for the weights of the hydrogen and oxygen\r\natoms, while with HO the ratio is 1 to 8.\r\n\r\nBerzelius attempted to bring about greater uniformity in formulas and\r\natomic weights by making changes in his table of atomic weights\r\npublished in 1826. He practically doubled the relative atomic weights of\r\nhydrogen, chlorine, nitrogen, and of the other elements that gave twice\r\nas many atoms in his formulas as in those of others, and at the same\r\ntime he wrote the symbols of these elements with a bar across them to\r\nindicate that they represented double atoms. For example, he wrote:\r\n\r\n                            H̶O ZnC̶l N̶O_{5},\r\n\r\ninstead of\r\n\r\n                      H_{2}O, ZnCl_{2} N_{2}O_{5}\r\n\r\nThis appears to have been an unfortunate concession to the views of\r\nothers on the part of Berzelius, for the barred symbols were not\r\ngenerally adopted, partly on account of difficulties in printing, and\r\nthe great achievement in theory made by him was lost sight of for a long\r\nperiod of time.\r\n\r\n_The Law of Atomic Heats._—In 1819, Dulong and Petit of France, from\r\nexperiments upon the specific heats of a number of solid elementary\r\nsubstances, came to the conclusion that the atoms of simple substances\r\nhave equal capacities for heat, or in other words, that the specific\r\nheats of elements multiplied by their atomic weights give a constant\r\ncalled the atomic heat. For instance, the specific heats of sulphur,\r\niron, and gold have been given as 0·2026, 0·110, and 0·0324, while their\r\natomic weights are about 32, 56, and 197, respectively; hence the atomic\r\nheats obtained by multiplication are 6·483, 6·116, and 6·383.\r\n\r\nFurther investigations showed that the atomic heats display a\r\nconsiderable variation. Those of carbon, boron, beryllium, and silicon\r\nare very low at ordinary temperatures, although they increase and\r\napproach the usual values at higher temperatures. More recent work has\r\nshown, however, that the specific heats of other elements vary greatly\r\nwith the temperature, almost disappearing at the temperature of liquid\r\nhydrogen, and hence possibly disappearing entirely at the absolute zero,\r\nwhere the electrical resistance of the metals appears to vanish\r\nlikewise.\r\n\r\nIt has been found that most of the solid elements near ordinary\r\ntemperatures give atomic heats that are approximately 6·4. Berzelius\r\napplied the law in fixing a number of atomic weights, and its importance\r\nfor this purpose is still recognized.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned here that two well-known Yale men, W. O. Mixter and\r\nE. S. Dana, while students in Bunsen’s laboratory at Heidelberg in 1873,\r\nmade determinations of the specific heats of boron, silicon, and\r\nzirconium. This was the first determination of this constant for\r\nzirconium, and it was consequently important in establishing the atomic\r\nweight of that element.\r\n\r\n_Isomorphism and Polymorphism._—Mitscherlich observed in 1818 that\r\ncertain phosphates and arsenates have the same crystalline form, and\r\nafterwards he reached the conclusion that identity in form indicates\r\nsimilarity in composition in connection with the number of atoms and\r\ntheir arrangement. This law of isomorphism was of much assistance in the\r\nestablishment of correct formulas and consequently of atomic weights.\r\nFor instance, since the carbonates of barium, strontium, and lead\r\ncrystallize in the same form, the oxides of these metals must have\r\nanalogous formulas. From such considerations Berzelius was able to make\r\nseveral improvements in his atomic weight table of 1826.\r\n\r\nMitscherlich was the first to observe two forms of sulphur crystals, and\r\nfrom this and other cases of dimorphism or of polymorphism it became\r\nevident that analogous compounds were not necessarily always\r\nisomorphous, a circumstance which has restricted the application of the\r\nlaw to some extent.\r\n\r\nBesides its application in fixing analogous formulas, the law of\r\nisomorphism has come to be of much practical use in the understanding\r\nand simplification of the formulas for minerals, for these natural\r\ncrystals very often contain several isomorphous compounds in varying\r\nproportions, and an understanding of this “isomorphous replacement,” as\r\nit is called, makes it possible to deduce simple general formulas for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn some cases isomorphism takes place to a greater or less extent\r\nbetween substances which are not chemically similar, and this brings\r\nabout a variation in composition which at times has caused confusion.\r\nFor instance, the mineral pyrrhotite has a composition which usually\r\nvaries between Fe_{7}S_{8} and Fe_{11}S_{12}, and both these formulas\r\nhave been assigned to it. It was recently shown by Allen, Crenshaw and\r\nJohnston in the Journal (=33=, 169, 1912) that this is a case where the\r\ncompound FeS is capable of taking up various amounts of sulphur\r\nisomorphously.\r\n\r\nThe idea of solid solution was advanced by van’t Hoff to explain the\r\ncrystallization of mixtures, including cases of evident isomorphism.\r\nThis view has been widely accepted, and it has been particularly useful\r\nin cases where isomorphism is not evident. Solid solution between metals\r\nhas been found to be exceedingly common, many alloys being of this\r\ncharacter. A case of this kind was observed by Cooke and described in\r\nthe Journal (=20=, 222, 1855). He prepared two well-crystallized\r\ncompounds of zinc and antimony to which he gave the formulas Zn_{3}Sb\r\nand Zn_{2}Sb, but he observed that excellent crystals of each could be\r\nobtained which varied largely in composition from these formulas. As the\r\ntwo compounds were dissimilar in their formulas and crystalline forms,\r\nCooke assumed that isomorphism was impossible and concluded “that it is\r\ndue to an actual perturbation of the law of definite proportions,\r\nproduced by the influence of mass.” We should now regard this as a case\r\nof solid solution.\r\n\r\n_A Lack of Confidence in Avogadro’s Principle._—One reason why chemists\r\nwere so slow in arriving at the correct atomic weights and formulas was\r\na partial loss of confidence in Avogadro’s principle. About 1826 the\r\nyoung French chemist Dumas devised an excellent method for the\r\ndetermination of vapor densities at high temperatures, and his results\r\nand those of others showed some discrepancies in the expected densities.\r\nFor example, the vapor density of sulphur was found to be about three\r\ntimes too great, that of phosphorus twice too great, that of mercury\r\nvapor and that of ammonium chloride only about half large enough to\r\ncorrespond to the values expected from analogy and other considerations.\r\nThus, one volume of oxygen with two volumes of hydrogen make two volumes\r\nof steam, but only one third of a volume of sulphur vapor was found to\r\nunite with two volumes of hydrogen to make two volumes of hydrogen\r\nsulphide. Berzelius saw clearly that the results pointed to the\r\nexistence of such molecules as S_{6}, P_{4}, and Hg_{1}, but it was not\r\ngenerally realized in those days that Avogadro’s rule is fundamentally\r\nreliable, and Berzelius himself appears to have lost confidence in it on\r\naccount of these complications, for he did not apply Avogadro’s\r\nprinciple to decisions about atomic weights, except in the cases of\r\nsubstances gaseous at ordinary temperatures.\r\n\r\n_Electro-chemical Theories._—The observation was made by Nicholson and\r\nCarlisle in 1800 that water was decomposed into its constituent gases by\r\nthe electric current. Then in 1803 Berzelius and Hisinger found that\r\nsalts were decomposed into their bases and acids by the same agency, and\r\nin 1807 Davy isolated potassium, sodium, and other metals afterwards, by\r\na similar decomposition. Since those early times a vast amount of\r\nattention has been paid to the relation of electricity to chemical\r\nchanges, a relation that is evidently of great importance from the fact\r\nthat while electric currents decompose chemical compounds, these\r\ncurrents, on the other hand, are produced by chemical reactions.\r\n\r\nBerzelius was particularly prominent in this direction, and in 1819 he\r\npublished an elaborate electro-chemical theory. He believed that atoms\r\nwere electrically polarized, and that this was the cause of their\r\ncombination with one another. He extended this idea to groups of atoms,\r\nparticularly to oxides, and regarded these groups as positive or\r\nnegative, according to the excess of positive or negative electricity\r\nderived from their constituent atoms and remaining free. He thus arrived\r\nat his dualistic theory of chemical compounds, which attained great\r\nprominence and prevailed for a long time in chemical theory. According\r\nto this idea, each compound was supposed to be made up of a positive and\r\na negative atom or group of atoms. For example, the formulas for\r\npotassium nitrate, calcium carbonate, and sulphuric acid corresponded to\r\nK_{2}O.N_{2}O_{5}, CaO.CO_{2} and H_{2}O.SO_{3} where we now write\r\nKNO_{3}, CaCO_{3} and H_{2}SO_{4}, and the theory was extended to\r\nembrace organic compounds also.\r\n\r\nThe eminent English chemist and physicist Faraday announced the\r\nimportant law of electro-chemical equivalents in 1834. This law shows\r\nthat the quantities of elements set free by the passage of a given\r\nquantity of electricity through their solutions correspond to the\r\nchemical equivalents of those elements. Faraday made a table of the\r\nequivalents of a number of elements, regarding them important in\r\nconnection with atomic weights, but at that time no sharp distinction\r\nwas usually made between equivalents and atomic weights, and it was not\r\nfully realized that one atom of a given element may be the electrical\r\nequivalent of several atoms of another.\r\n\r\nFaraday’s law, which is still regarded as fundamentally exact, has been\r\nof much practical use in the measurement of electric currents and in\r\ncalculations connected with electro-chemical processes. In discussing\r\nhis experiments, Faraday made use of several new terms, such as\r\n“electrolyte” for a substance which conducts electricity when in\r\nsolution, and is thus “electrolyzed,” “electrode,” “anode,” and\r\n“cathode,” terms that have come into general use, and finally “ions” for\r\nthe particles that were supposed to “wander” towards the electrodes to\r\nbe set free there.\r\n\r\nThis term “ion” remained in comparative obscurity for more than half a\r\ncentury, when it was brought into great prominence among chemists by\r\nArrhenius in connection with the ionic theory.\r\n\r\n_Cannizzaro’s Ideas._—Up to about 1869 chaos reigned among the formulas\r\nused by different chemists. Various compound radicals and numerous\r\ntype-formulas were employed, dualistic and unitary formulas of several\r\nkinds were in use, but the worst feature of the situation was the fact\r\nthat more than one system of atomic weights was in vogue, so that water\r\nmight be written\r\n\r\n                           HO, H̶O, or H_{2}0\r\n\r\nand similar discrepancies might appear in nearly all formulas containing\r\nelements of different valencies. In 1858, however, an article by the\r\nItalian chemist Cannizzaro appeared in which the outlines of a course in\r\nchemical philosophy were presented. This acquired wide circulation in\r\nthe form of a pamphlet at a chemical convention somewhat later, and it\r\ndealt so clearly and ably with Avogadro’s principle, Dulong and Petit’s\r\nlaw, and other points in connection with formulas that it led to a rapid\r\nand almost universal reform among those who were using unsatisfactory\r\nformulas.\r\n\r\nAt about this time also the dualistic formulas of Berzelius were\r\ngenerally abandoned, and hydrogen came to be regarded as the\r\ncharacteristic element of all acids. For instance, CaO.SO_{3}, called\r\n“sulphate of lime,” came to be written CaSO_{4} and was called “calcium\r\nsulphate,” and while it had been shown as early as 1815 by Davy that\r\n“iodic acid,” I_{2}O_{5}, showed no acid reaction until it was combined\r\nwith water, the accumulation of similar facts led to the formulation of\r\nsulphuric acid as H_{2}SO_{4} instead of SO_{3} or H_{2}O.SO_{3}, and\r\nthat of other “oxygen acids” in a similar way. As a necessary\r\nconsequence of this view of acids, the bases came to be regarded as\r\ncompounds of the “hydroxyl” group, OH. Therefore the formula for caustic\r\nsoda came to be written NaOH instead of Na_{2}O.H_{2}O, and so on.\r\n\r\n_The Periodic System of the Elements._—The periodicity of the elements\r\nin connection with their atomic weights was roughly grasped by Newlands\r\nin England, who announced his “law of octaves” in 1863. This was at the\r\ntime when the atomic weights were being modified and their numerical\r\nrelations properly shown. The subject was worked out more fully by L.\r\nMeyer in Germany a little later, but it was most clearly and elaborately\r\npresented by the Russian chemist Mendeléeff in 1869.\r\n\r\nIn order that this subject may be explained to some extent Mendeléeff’s\r\ntable is given here, with the addition of the recently discovered\r\nelements and some other modifications.\r\n\r\n

The heavy line encloses approximately\r\n    the acid-forming elements.\r\n\r\nIn this table the elements arranged in the order of their atomic weights\r\nfall into eight groups where the known oxides progress regularly, with\r\nthe exception of two or three elements, from R_{2}O in Group I to\r\nR_{2}O_{7} in Group VII, while in Group VIII two oxides (of ruthenium\r\nand osmium) are known which carry the progression to RO_{4}.\r\n\r\nIt was pointed out by Mendeléeff that, with the exception of series 1\r\nand 2 at the top of the table, the alternate members of the groups show\r\nparticularly close relationships. These subordinate groups, marked A and\r\nB, in most cases show remarkable analogies and gradations in their\r\nproperties, for example, in the alkali-metals from lithium to cæsium,\r\nand in the halogens from fluorine to iodine. The two divisions of a\r\ngroup do not usually show very close relations to each other, except in\r\ntheir valency, and they even display, in several instances, opposite\r\ngradations in chemical activity in the order of their atomic weights.\r\nFor instance, cæsium stands at the electro-positive end, while gold\r\nstands at the electro-negative end of its subordinate group. The\r\ndifference between the two divisions is very great in Groups VI and VII,\r\nbut it is extreme in Group VIII, where heavy metals are on one side and\r\ninactive gases on the other. Many authorities separate these gases into\r\na “Group O” by themselves at the left-hand side of the table, but this\r\ndoes not change their relative positions, and the plan may be objected\r\nto on the ground that many vacant places are thus left in the groups\r\nVIII and O.\r\n\r\nThe periodic law has been useful in rectifying certain atomic weights.\r\nAt the outset Mendeléeff was obliged to change beryllium from 14·5\r\n(assuming Be_{2}O_{3}) to 9 (assuming BeO), and later the atomic weights\r\nof indium and uranium were changed to make them fit the system. All of\r\nthese changes have been confirmed by physical means.\r\n\r\nMendeléeff found a number of vacant places in his table, and was thus\r\nable to render further service to chemical science by predicting the\r\nproperties of undiscovered elements, and his predictions were very\r\nclosely confirmed by the later discovery of scandium, gallium, and\r\ngermanium. The table indicates that there are still two undiscovered\r\nelements below manganese and probably two more among the rare-earth\r\nmetals. The interesting observation has just recently been made by Soddy\r\nthat the products of radioactive disintegration appear to pass in a\r\nsymmetrical way through positions in the periodic system, giving off a\r\nhelium molecule at alternate transformations until the place of lead is\r\nreached. It appears, therefore, that the five vacant places in the table\r\nabove bismuth are probably occupied by these evanescent elements, and it\r\nis to be noticed that all of the elements that have been placed in this\r\nregion of high atomic weights are radioactive.\r\n\r\nThere are some inconsistencies in the periodic system. The increments in\r\nthe atomic weights are irregular, and there are three cases, argon and\r\npotassium, cobalt and nickel, and tellurium and iodine, where a higher\r\natomic weight is placed before a lower one in order to bring these\r\nelements into their undoubtedly proper places. There is a peculiarity\r\nalso in the heavy-metal division of Group VIII, where three similar\r\nelements occur in each of three places, and where the usual periodicity\r\nappears to be suspended, or nearly so, in comparison with most of the\r\nother elements. However, there seems to be a still more remarkable case\r\nof this kind in Group III, where fourteen metals of the rare earths have\r\nbeen placed. They are astonishingly similar in their chemical\r\nproperties, hence it seems necessary to assume that periodicity is\r\nsuspended here throughout the wide range of atomic weights from 139 to\r\n174, where no elements save these have been found.\r\n\r\nSeveral other interesting features of the table may be pointed out. The\r\nchlorides and hydrides, as indicated by the “typical compounds,” show a\r\nregular progression in both directions towards Group IV. (Where the\r\ntype-formulas do not apply, as far as is known, to more than one or two\r\nelements, they have been placed in parentheses in the table given here.)\r\nIt is a striking fact that the acid-forming elements occur together in a\r\ndefinite part of the table, and that the gases and other non-metallic\r\nelements, except the inactive gases of Group VIII, occur in the same\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n_Atomic Numbers._—As the result of a spectroscopic study of the wave\r\nlengths or frequencies of the X-rays produced when cathode rays strike\r\nupon anticathodes composed of different elements, Moseley in 1914\r\ndiscovered that whole numbers in a simple series can be attributed to\r\nthe atoms. These atomic numbers are: 1 for hydrogen, 2 for helium, 3 for\r\nlithium, 4 for beryllium, and so on, in the order in which the elements\r\noccur in Mendeléeff’s periodic table, and in the cases of argon and\r\npotassium, cobalt and nickel, and tellurium and iodine, they follow the\r\ncorrect chemical order, while the atomic weights do not. They appear to\r\nindicate, therefore, an even more fundamental relation between the atoms\r\nthan that shown by the atomic weights.\r\n\r\nThese numbers are now available for every element up to lead, and they\r\nare particularly interesting in indicating, on account of missing\r\nnumbers, the existence of two undiscovered elements in the manganese\r\ngroup, and two more among the rare-earth metals, in confirmation of the\r\nvacant places below lead in Mendeléeff’s table.\r\n\r\n_The Isolation of Elements._—In the year 1818 about 53 elements were\r\nrecognized, and since that time about 30 more have been discovered, but\r\nthe elements already known comprised the more common ones, and nearly\r\nall of those which have been commercially important. A few of them,\r\nincluding beryllium, aluminium, silicon, magnesium, and fluorine, were\r\nthen known only in their compounds, as they had not yet been isolated in\r\nthe free condition.\r\n\r\nBerzelius in 1823 prepared silicon, a non-metallic element resembling\r\ncarbon in many respects. This element has recently been prepared on a\r\nrather large scale in electric furnaces at Niagara Falls, and has been\r\nused for certain purposes in the form of castings.\r\n\r\nWöhler created much sensation in 1827 by isolating aluminium and finding\r\nit to be a very light, strong and malleable metal, stable in the air,\r\nand of a silver-white color. For a long time this metal was a\r\ncomparative rarity, being prepared by the reduction of aluminium\r\nchloride with metallic sodium; but about 25 years ago Hall, an American,\r\ndevised a method of preparing it by electrolyzing aluminium oxide\r\ndissolved in fused cryolite. This process reduced the cost of aluminium\r\nto such an extent that it has now come into common use.\r\n\r\nWöhler and Bussy prepared beryllium in 1828, and Liebig and Bussy did\r\nthe same service for magnesium in 1830. The latter metal has come to be\r\nof much practical importance, both as a very powerful reducing agent in\r\nchemical operations, and as an ingredient of flash-light powders and of\r\nmixtures used for fireworks. It is also used in making certain light\r\nalloys.\r\n\r\nAfter almost innumerable attempts to isolate fluorine, during a period\r\nof nearly a century, this was finally accomplished in 1886 by Moissan in\r\nFrance by the electrolysis of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. The free\r\nfluorine proved to be a gas of extraordinary chemical activity,\r\ndecomposing water at once with the formation of hydrogen fluoride and\r\nozonized oxygen. This fact explains the failure of many previous\r\nattempts to prepare it in the presence of water.\r\n\r\n_Early Discoveries of New Elements._—The remarkable activity of chemical\r\nresearch at the beginning of our period is illustrated by the fact that\r\nthree new elements were discovered in 1817. In that year Berzelius had\r\ndiscovered selenium, Arfvedson, working in Berzelius’s laboratory had\r\ndiscovered the important alkali-metal lithium, and Stromeyer had\r\ndiscovered cadmium.\r\n\r\nIn 1826 Ballard in France discovered bromine in the mother-liquor from\r\nthe crystallization of common salt from sea water. Bromine proved to be\r\nan unusually interesting element, being the only non-metallic one that\r\nis liquid at ordinary temperatures, and being strikingly intermediate in\r\nits properties between chlorine and iodine. It has been obtained in\r\nlarge quantities from brines, and is produced extensively in the United\r\nStates. The elementary substance and its compounds have found important\r\napplications in chemical operations, while the bromides have been found\r\nvaluable in medicine and silver bromide is very extensively used in\r\nphotography.\r\n\r\nIn 1828 Berzelius discovered thorium. The oxide of this metal has\r\nrecently been employed extensively as the principal constituent of\r\nincandescent gas-mantles, and the element has acquired particular\r\nimportance from the fact that, like uranium, it is radioactive,\r\ndecomposing spontaneously into other elements.\r\n\r\nVanadium had been encountered as early as 1801 by Del Rio, who named it\r\n“erythronium,” but a little later it was thought to be identical with\r\nchromium and was lost sight of for a while. In 1830, however, it was\r\nre-discovered by, and received its present name from Sefström in Sweden.\r\nBerzelius immediately made an extensive study of vanadium compounds, but\r\nhe gave them incorrect formulas and derived an incorrect atomic weight\r\nfor the element, because he mistook a lower oxide for the element\r\nitself. Roscoe in England in 1867 isolated vanadium for the first time,\r\nfound the right atomic weight, and gave correct formulas to its\r\ncompounds. Vanadium is particularly interesting from the fact that it\r\ndisplays several valencies in its compounds, many of which are highly\r\ncolored. It has found important use as an ingredient in very small\r\nproportions in certain “special steels” to which it imparts a high\r\ndegree of resistance to rupture by repeated shocks.\r\n\r\nColumbium was discovered early in the nineteenth century in the mineral\r\ncolumbite from Connecticut by Hatchett, an Englishman, who did not,\r\nhowever, obtain the pure oxide. It was afterwards obtained by Rose who\r\nnamed it niobium. Both names for the element are in use, but the former\r\nhas priority. Attention was called to this fact by an article in the\r\nJournal by Connell, an Englishman (=18=, 392, 1854).\r\n\r\n_The Platinum Group of Metals._—In 1854 a new member of the platinum\r\ngroup of metals, ruthenium, was discovered by Claus. Platinum had been\r\ndiscovered about the middle of the eighteenth century, while its other\r\nrarer associates, iridium, osmium, palladium, and rhodium, had been\r\nrecognized in the very early years of the nineteenth century. It was\r\nduring the latter period that platinum ware began to be employed to a\r\nconsiderable extent in chemical operations, and this use was greatly\r\nextended as time went on. The discovery was made by Phillips in 1831\r\nthat finely divided platinum by contact would bring about the\r\ncombination of sulphur dioxide with atmospheric oxygen, and this\r\napplication during the past 20 years has become enormously important in\r\nthe sulphuric acid industry, while other important applications of\r\nplatinum as a “catalytic agent” have also been made. Wolcott Gibbs and\r\nCarey Lea have contributed perhaps more than any other recent chemists\r\nto a knowledge of the platinum metals. Carey Lea (=38=, 81, 248, 1864)\r\ndealt chiefly with the separation of the metals from each other, while\r\nGibbs’s work (=31=, 63, 1861; =34=, 341, 1862) included investigations\r\nof many of the compounds.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned that while platinum and its associates were formerly\r\nknown only in the uncombined condition in nature, the arsenide\r\nsperrylite, PtAs_{2}, was described by the late S. L. Penfield, and the\r\nsenior writer of this chapter, in articles published in the Journal\r\n(=37=, 67, 71, 1889).\r\n\r\n_Applications of the Spectroscope._—The discovery in certain mineral\r\nwaters of the rare alkali-metals rubidium and cæsium by Bunsen and\r\nKirchoff in 1861 was in consequence of the application of spectroscopy\r\nby these same scientists a short time previously to the identification\r\nof elements imparting colors to the flame. Since that time the\r\nemployment of the spectroscope for chemical purposes has been much\r\nextended, as it has been used in the examination of light from electric\r\nsparks and arcs, as well as from Geissler tube discharges and from\r\ncolored solutions.\r\n\r\nThe metals rubidium and cæsium are interesting in being closely\r\nanalogous to potassium and in standing at the extreme electro-positive\r\nend of the series of known metals. It should be noticed here that\r\nJohnson and Allen of our Sheffield Laboratory, having obtained a good\r\nsupply of rubidium and cæsium material from the lepidolite of Hebron,\r\nMaine, made some important researches upon these elements, accounts of\r\nwhich were published in the Journal (=34=, 367, 1862; =35=, 94, 1863).\r\nThey established the atomic weight of cæsium, thus correcting Bunsen’s\r\ndetermination which was unsatisfactory on account of the small quantity\r\nand impurity of his material. Pollucite, a mineral rich in cæsium, which\r\nhad been found in very small amount on the Island of Elba, has more\r\nrecently been obtained in large quantities—hundreds of pounds—at Paris,\r\nMaine, and its vicinity. This American pollucite was first analyzed and\r\nidentified by the senior writer of this article (=41=, 213, 1891), and\r\nlater (=43=, 17, 1892 _et seq._) the results of many investigations on\r\ncæsium and rubidium compounds, in which the junior writer played an\r\nimportant part, carried out in Sheffield Laboratory, were published in\r\nthe Journal.\r\n\r\nThe application of the spectroscope led to the discovery of thallium in\r\n1861 by Crookes of England, and to that of indium in 1863 by Reich and\r\nRichter in Germany. Both of these metals are extremely rare, but they\r\nare of considerable theoretical interest. Thallium is particularly\r\nremarkable in showing resemblances in its different compounds to several\r\ngroups of metals.\r\n\r\nThe spectroscope was employed again in connection with the discovery of\r\ngallium in 1875 by Boisbaudran. It is in the same periodic group as\r\nthallium and indium, and it has a remarkably low melting point, just\r\nabove ordinary room-temperature. It has been among the rarest of the\r\nrare elements, but within two or three years a source of it has been\r\nfound in the United States in certain residues from the refining of\r\ncommercial zinc. The recent issues of the Journal (=41=, 351, 1916;\r\n=42=, 389, 1916) show that Browning and Uhler of Yale have availed\r\nthemselves of this new material in order to make important chemical and\r\nphysical researches upon this metal.\r\n\r\n_Germanium._—The discovery of germanium in the mineral argyrodite in\r\n1886 by Winkler revealed a curious metal which gives a white sulphide\r\nthat may be easily mistaken for sulphur and which is volatilized\r\ncompletely when its hydrochloric acid solution is evaporated, so that it\r\nis evasive in analytical operations. This element had been predicted\r\nwith much accuracy by Mendeléeff, and it is rather closely related to\r\ntin.\r\n\r\nA few years after the discovery of germanium, Penfield published in the\r\nJournal (=46=, 107, 1893; =47=, 451, 1894) some analyses of argyrodite,\r\ncorrecting the formula given by Winkler to the mineral; also he\r\ndescribed canfieldite, an analogous mineral from Bolivia, in which a\r\nlarge part of the germanium was replaced by tin.\r\n\r\n_The Rare Earths._—Before the year 1818 two rare earths, the oxides of\r\nyttrium and cerium, were known in an impure condition. Since that time\r\nabout fourteen others have been discovered as associates of the first\r\ntwo. The rare earths are peculiar from the fact that many of them are\r\nalways found mixed together in the minerals containing them, and also\r\nfrom the circumstance that most of them are remarkably similar in their\r\nchemical reactions and consequently exceedingly difficult to separate\r\nfrom each other. In many cases multitudes of fractional precipitations\r\nor crystallizations are needed to obtain pure salts of a number of these\r\nmetals. The solutions of the salts of several of these elements give\r\ncharacteristic absorption bands when examined spectroscopically by the\r\nuse of transmitted light.\r\n\r\nNo important practical application has been found for any of these\r\nearthy oxides, except that about one per cent of cerium oxide is mixed\r\nwith thorium oxide in incandescent gas-mantles in order to obtain\r\ngreatly increased luminosity.\r\n\r\n_The Inactive Gases._—As long ago as 1785, Cavendish, that remarkable\r\nEnglishman who first weighed the world and first discovered the\r\ncomposition of water, actually obtained a little argon in a pure\r\ncondition by sparking atmospheric nitrogen with oxygen converting it\r\ninto nitric acid (another discovery of his) and absorbing the excess of\r\noxygen. The volume of this residual gas as estimated by him corresponds\r\nvery closely to the volume of argon in the atmosphere, as now known.\r\n\r\nIt was more than a century later, in 1894, that Rayleigh and Ramsay\r\ndiscovered argon in the air. Lord Rayleigh had found that atmospheric\r\nnitrogen was about one-half per cent heavier than chemical nitrogen, a\r\nfact which led to the investigation. It was only necessary to repeat\r\nCavendish’s experiment on a large scale, or to absorb oxygen with hot\r\ncopper and nitrogen with hot magnesium, in order to obtain argon. The\r\ngas attracted much attention, both on account of having but a single\r\natom in its molecule, and particularly because it failed to enter into\r\nchemical combination of any kind. This gas has been used of late for\r\nfilling the bulbs of incandescent electric lamps in cases where a gas\r\npressure without chemical action is desired.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 and 1891, Hillebrand published in the Journal (=40=, 384, 1890:\r\n=42=, 390, 1891) a series of analyses of the mineral uraninite and\r\nreported in some samples of the mineral as much as 2·5 per cent of an\r\ninactive gas. Hillebrand examined the gas spectroscopically but, just\r\nmissing an important discovery, he detected only the spectrum lines of\r\nnitrogen. Ramsay, in searching for argon in some sort of natural\r\ncombination, and doubtless remembering Hillebrand’s work, heated some\r\ncleveite, a variety of uraninite, and obtained, not argon, but a new\r\ngas. This gave a yellow spectrum-line corresponding to a line previously\r\nobserved in the light of the sun’s corona and attributed to an element\r\nin the sun called helium. Helium, therefore, in 1895 had been found on\r\nthe earth. This gas is a constant constituent of uranium minerals, as it\r\nis produced by the breaking down of radioactive elements. It has been\r\nfound in very small quantity in the atmosphere, and is the most\r\ndifficult of all known gases to liquefy, as its boiling point, as shown\r\nby Onnes in 1908, is only 4° above the absolute zero. It has not yet\r\nbeen solidified.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 Ramsay and Travers, by the use of ingenious methods of\r\nfractional distillation and absorption by charcoal, obtained three other\r\nmuch rarer inactive gases from the atmosphere which they called neon,\r\nkrypton and xenon.\r\n\r\nThe inactive gases are all colorless, and as they form no chemical\r\ncompounds they are characterized by their densities, which give their\r\natomic weights, by their boiling points, and by their characteristic\r\nGeissler-tube spectra.\r\n\r\nThe gaseous radium emanation, or niton, belongs also to the inactive\r\ngroup, and it was also collected and studied by Ramsay who was compelled\r\nto work with only 0·0001 cc. of it, as the volume obtained by heating\r\nradium salts is very small. It is an evanescent element, disappearing\r\nwithin a few days on account of radioactive disintegration. Meanwhile it\r\nglows brilliantly when liquefied and cooled to the temperature of liquid\r\nair. It has an atomic weight of 222, four units below that of radium,\r\nand the difference is considered as due to the loss by radium of an atom\r\nof helium in passing into the emanation.\r\n\r\n_The Radioactive Elements._—The discovery of radium in 1898 by Madame\r\nCurie, and the study of that and other radioactive elements has produced\r\na profound effect upon chemical theory. It was found that the two\r\nelements of the highest atomic weights, uranium and thorium, are always\r\nspontaneously decomposing into other elements at a fixed rate of speed\r\nwhich can be controlled by no artificial means, and that the elements\r\nresulting from these decompositions likewise undergo spontaneous changes\r\ninto still other elements at greatly varying rates of speed, forming in\r\neach case a remarkable series of temporary elements. These\r\ntransformations are accompanied by the emission at enormous velocities\r\nof three kinds of rays, one variety of which has been shown to consist\r\nof helium atoms. The greater number of the elements formed in these\r\ntransformations have not as yet been obtained in a pure condition, and\r\nthey are known only in connection with their radioactivity, volatility,\r\netc.; but radium and niton, two of these products, have been obtained in\r\na pure condition, so that their atomic weights and their places in the\r\nperiodic system have been fixed.\r\n\r\nWe owe much of our knowledge of the radioactive transformations to the\r\nresearches of Rutherford and of Soddy, and of their co-workers, but one\r\nof the important products of the transformation of uranium, an element\r\nwhich he called ionium, was characterized by Boltwood of Yale (=25=,\r\n365, 1908).\r\n\r\nRadium and niton, apart from their radioactive properties, resemble\r\nbarium and the inert gases of the atmosphere, respectively. The rates at\r\nwhich their progenitors produce them, and the rates at which they\r\nthemselves decompose, bring about a state of equilibrium after a time.\r\nTherefore a given amount of uranium, which decomposes exceedingly\r\nslowly, can yield even after thousands of years only a very small\r\nproportional quantity of undecomposed radium, one-half of which\r\ndisappears in about 2500 years, because the amount decomposed must\r\neventually be equal to the amount produced. The first conclusive\r\nevidence that radium is a product of the decomposition of uranium was\r\ngiven by Boltwood in the Journal (=18=, 97, 1904). He found that all\r\nuranium minerals contain radium; and the amount of radium present is\r\nalways proportional to the amount of uranium, which shows the genetic\r\nrelation between the two.\r\n\r\nIn the case of niton, which is produced by radium, and is called also\r\nthe radium emanation, the rate of decay is rapid, so that if the gas is\r\nexpelled from radium by heating, equilibrium is reached after a few\r\ndays, with the accumulation of the largest possible amount of niton.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion has been reached by Rutherford and others that the final\r\nproduct besides helium, in the radioactive transformations, is lead, or\r\nat least an element or elements resembling lead to such a degree that no\r\nseparation of them by chemical means is possible. Atomic weight\r\ndeterminations by Richards and others have shown that specimens of lead\r\nfound in radioactive minerals give distinctly different atomic weights\r\nfrom that of ordinary lead. This fact has led to the view that possibly\r\nthe atoms of the elements are not all of the same weight, but vary\r\nwithin certain limits—a view that is contrary to previous conclusions\r\nderived from the uniformity in atomic weights obtained with material\r\nfrom many different sources.\r\n\r\nThe results of the investigations upon radioactivity have led to\r\nmodified views in regard to the stability of the elements in general.\r\nThere has been little or no proof obtained that any artificial\r\ntransmutation of the elements is possible, but the spontaneous\r\ntransformation of the radioactive elements brings forward the\r\npossibility that other elements are changing imperceptibly, and that a\r\nstate of evolution exists among them. All of the radioactive changes\r\nthat we know proceed from higher to lower atomic weights, and we are\r\nentirely ignorant of the process by which uranium and thorium must have\r\nbeen produced originally.\r\n\r\nSince radioactive changes have been found to be accompanied by the\r\nrelease of vast amounts of energy, compared with which the energy of\r\nchemical reactions is trivial, a new aspect in regard to the structure\r\nof atoms has arisen,—they must be complex in structure, the seats of\r\nenormous energy.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the amount of radium in the earth’s crust has\r\nindicated that the heat produced by it is amply sufficient to supply the\r\nloss of heat due to radiation, and this source of heat is regarded by\r\nmany as the cause of volcanic action. The sun’s radiant heat also has\r\nbeen supposed to be supplied by radioactive action, so that the older\r\nviews regarding the limitation of the age of the earth and the solar\r\nsystem on account of loss of heat have been considerably modified by our\r\nknowledge of radioactivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Physical Chemistry._\r\n\r\nThe application of physical methods as aids to chemical science began in\r\nearly times, and some of these, such as the determinations of gas and\r\nvapor densities, specific heats, and crystalline forms have been\r\nmentioned already in this article. Within recent times physical\r\nchemistry has greatly developed and a few of its important achievements\r\nwill now be described.\r\n\r\n_Molecular Weight Determinations._—Gas and vapor densities in connection\r\nwith Avogadro’s principle, formed the only basis for molecular weight\r\ndeterminations until comparatively recent times. The early methods of\r\nGay-Lussac and Dumas for vapor density were supplemented in 1868 by the\r\nmethod of Hofmann, whereby vapors were measured under diminished\r\npressure over mercury. In 1878 Victor Meyer introduced a simpler method\r\ndepending upon the displacement of air or other gas by the vapor in a\r\nheated tube. As refractory tubes, such as those of porcelain or even\r\niridium, could be used in this method, molecular weights at extremely\r\nhigh temperatures were determined with interesting results. For\r\ninstance, it was found that iodine vapor, which shows the molecule I_{2}\r\nat lower temperatures, gradually becomes monatomic with rise in\r\ntemperature, that sulphur vapor dissociates from S_{8} to S_{2} under\r\nsimilar conditions, and that most of the metals, including silver, have\r\nmonatomic vapors.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 and later it was pointed out by Raoult that the molecular\r\nweights of substances could be found from the freezing points of their\r\nsolutions, but this method was complicated from the fact that salts,\r\nstrong acids and strong bases behaved quite differently from other\r\nsubstances in this respect, and allowances had to be made for the types\r\nof substances used. The complication was afterwards explained by the\r\nionization theory of Arrhenius. Better apparatus for this method was\r\nsoon devised by Beckmann, who introduced also a method depending upon\r\nthe boiling points of solutions, and these two methods are still the\r\nstandard ones for determining molecular weights in solution. They are\r\nvery extensively employed by organic chemists.\r\n\r\nIt has been found that the majority of substances when dissolved have\r\nthe same molecular weight as in the gaseous condition, provided that\r\nthey can be volatilized at comparable temperatures. For instance,\r\nsulphur in solution has the formula S_{8}, iodine is I_{2} and the\r\nmetals are monatomic.\r\n\r\n_Van’t Hoff’s Law and Arrhenius’s Theory of Ions._—Modern views on\r\nsolutions date largely from 1886, when van’t Hoff called attention to\r\nthe relations existing between the osmotic pressure exerted by dissolved\r\nsubstances and gas pressure.\r\n\r\nPfeffer, a botanist, was the first to measure osmotic pressure (1877).\r\nBasing his conclusions chiefly upon Pfeffer’s determinations, van’t Hoff\r\nformulated a new and highly important law, which may be stated as\r\nfollows: The osmotic pressure exerted by a substance in solution is\r\nequal to the gas pressure that the substance would exert if it were a\r\ngas at the same temperature and the same volume. Further investigations\r\nhave fully established the fact that molecules in dilute solution obey\r\nthe simple laws of gases.\r\n\r\nIt was pointed out by van’t Hoff that salts, strong acids and strong\r\nbases showed marked exceptions to his law in exerting much greater\r\nosmotic pressures than those calculated for them.\r\n\r\nThe next year in 1887, Arrhenius explained this abnormal behavior of\r\nsalts, strong acids and strong bases by assuming that they dissociate\r\nspontaneously into ions when they dissolve, and that these more numerous\r\nparticles act like molecules in producing osmotic pressure. He showed\r\nthat these exceptional substances all conduct electricity in solution,\r\nwhile those conforming with van’t Hoff’s law do not, and according to\r\nhis theory the ions become positively or negatively charged when they\r\nare formed, and these charged ions conduct the current. For example a\r\nmolecule of sodium chloride was supposed to give the two ions Na^+ and\r\nCl^-, thus exerting twice as much osmotic pressure as a single molecule.\r\n\r\nDeterminations of osmotic pressure or related values, such as depression\r\nof the freezing point and of electric conductivity, indicated that\r\nionization could not be regarded as complete in any case except in\r\nexceedingly dilute solutions, and that the extent of ionization varied\r\nwith different substances. The fact that osmotic pressures and electric\r\nconductivities gave closely agreeing results in regard to the extent of\r\nionization in various cases, is the strongest evidence in support of the\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult at first for many chemists to believe that atoms, such\r\nas those of sodium and chlorine, and groups such as NH_{4} and SO_{4}\r\ncould exist independently in solution, even though electrically charged.\r\nHowever, the theory rapidly gained ground and is now accepted by nearly\r\nevery chemist as a satisfactory explanation of many facts.\r\n\r\nDuring recent years, many investigations relating to osmotic pressure\r\nand ionization have been carried out in the United States, but only the\r\nwork of Morse, A. A. Noyes, and the late H. C. Jones can be merely\r\nalluded to here. It should be mentioned that the eminent author of the\r\nionic hypothesis gave the Silliman Memorial course of lectures at Yale\r\nin 1911 on Theories of Solution.\r\n\r\n_Colloidal Solutions._—Graham, an English chemist, in 1861 was the first\r\nto make a distinction between substances forming true solutions, which\r\nhe called crystalloids, and those of a gummy nature resembling glue,\r\nwhich in solution do not diffuse readily through parchment membranes, as\r\ncrystalloids do, and which he called colloids. The separation of\r\ncolloids by means of parchment was called dialysis, and this process has\r\ncome into extensive use in preparing pure colloidal solutions. Slow\r\ndiffusion is now regarded as characteristic of colloids rather than\r\ntheir gummy condition.\r\n\r\nColloidal solutions occupy an intermediate position between true\r\nsolutions and suspensions, resembling one or the other according to the\r\nkind of colloid and the fineness of division. By preparing filters with\r\npores of varying degrees of fineness, Bechold has been able to separate\r\ncolloids from each other in accordance with the size of their particles.\r\nIt has also been possible to prepare different solutions of a colloid\r\nvarying gradually from one in which the particles were undoubtedly in\r\nsuspension to one which had many of the properties of a true solution.\r\n\r\nBeginning in 1889, Carey Lea described in the Journal (=37=, 476, 1889\r\n_et seq._) a variety of methods for preparing colloidal solutions of the\r\nmetals, consisting in general of treating solutions of metallic salts\r\nwith mild reducing agents. His work on colloidal silver was particularly\r\nextensive and interesting. Solutions of this kind have recently yielded\r\nsome extremely interesting results by means of the ultra-microscope, an\r\napparatus devised by Zsigmondy and Siedentopf. A very intense beam of\r\nlight is passed through the solution and observed at right angles with a\r\npowerful microscope. Under these conditions, particles much too small to\r\nbe seen by other means, reveal their presence by reflected light. It has\r\nbeen possible in a very dilute solution of known strength to count the\r\nparticles and thus to calculate their size. The smallest colloidal\r\nparticles measured in this way were of gold and were shown to have\r\napproximately ten times the diameter, or 1000 times the volume,\r\nattributed to ordinary molecules. It is of interest that the particles\r\nappear in rapid motion corresponding to the well-known Brownian\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThe chemistry of colloids has now assumed such importance that it may be\r\nconsidered as a separate branch of the science. It has its own technical\r\njournal and deals largely with the chemistry of organic products. All\r\nliving matter is built up of colloids, and hæmoglobin, starch, proteins,\r\nrubber and milk are examples of colloidal substances or solutions. Among\r\ninorganic substances, many sulphides, silicic acid, and the amorphous\r\nhydroxides, like ferric hydroxide, frequently act as colloids.\r\n\r\n_Law of Mass Action._—Berthollet about the beginning of the last century\r\nwas the first chemist to study the effect of mass, or more correctly,\r\nthe concentration of substances on chemical action. His views summarized\r\nby himself are as follows: “The chemical activity of a substance depends\r\nupon the force of its affinity and upon the mass which is present in a\r\ngiven volume.” The development of this idea, which is fundamentally\r\ncorrect, was greatly hindered by the fact that Berthollet drew the\r\nincorrect conclusion that the composition of chemical compounds depended\r\nupon the masses of the substances combining to produce them, a\r\nconclusion in direct contradiction to the law of definite proportions,\r\nand since this view was soon disproved by Proust and others,\r\nBerthollet’s law in its other applications received no immediate\r\nattention. Mitchell, however, pointed out in the Journal (=16=, 234,\r\n1829) the importance of Berthollet’s work, and Heinrich Rose in 1842\r\nagain called attention to the effect of mass, mentioning as one\r\nillustration the effect of water and carbonic acid in decomposing the\r\nvery stable natural silicates. Somewhat later several other chemists\r\nmade important contributions to the question of the influence of\r\nconcentration upon chemical action, but it was the Norwegians, Guldberg\r\nand Waage, who first formulated the law of mass action in 1867.\r\n\r\nThis law has been of enormous importance in chemical theory, since it\r\nexplains a great many facts upon a mathematical basis. It applies\r\nparticularly to equilibrium in reversible reactions, where it states\r\nthat the product of the concentrations on the one side of a simple\r\nreversible equation bears a constant relation to the products of the\r\nconcentrations on the other side, provided that the temperature remains\r\nconstant. In cases of this kind where two gases or vapors react with two\r\nsolids, the latter if always in excess may be regarded as constant in\r\nconcentration, and the law takes on a simpler aspect in applying only to\r\nthe concentrations of the gaseous substances. For example, in the\r\nreversible reaction\r\n\r\n                 3Fe + 4H_{2}O ⇄ Fe_{3}O_{4} + 4H_{2},\r\n\r\nwhich takes place at rather high temperatures, a definite mixture of\r\nsteam and hydrogen at a definite temperature will cause the reaction to\r\nproceed with equal rapidity in both directions, thus maintaining a state\r\nof equilibrium, provided that both iron and the oxide are present in\r\nexcess. If, however, the relative concentrations of the hydrogen and\r\nsteam are changed, or even if the temperature is changed, the reaction\r\nwill proceed faster in one direction than in the other until equilibrium\r\nis again attained.\r\n\r\nThe principle of mass action also explains why it is sometimes possible\r\nfor a reversible reaction to become complete in either direction. For\r\ninstance, in connection with the reaction that has just been considered,\r\nif steam is passed over heated iron and if hydrogen is passed over the\r\nheated oxide, the gaseous product in each case is gradually carried\r\naway, and the reaction continually proceeds faster in one direction than\r\nin the other until it is complete, according to the equations\r\n\r\n               3Fe + 4H_{2}O → 3Fe_{3}O_{4} + 4H_{2}, and\r\n\r\n               Fe_{3}O_{4} + 4H_{2} → 3Fe + 4H_{2}O.\r\n\r\nMany other well-known and important facts, both chemical and physical,\r\ndepend upon this law. It explains the circumstance that a vapor-pressure\r\nis not dependent upon the amount of the liquid that is present; it also\r\nexplains the constant dissociation pressure of calcium carbonate at a\r\ngiven temperature, irrespective of the amounts of carbonate and oxide\r\npresent; in connection with the ionic theory, it furnishes the reason\r\nfor the variable solubility of salts due to the presence of electrolytes\r\ncontaining ions in common; and it elucidates Henry’s law which states\r\nthat the solubilities of gases are proportional to their pressures.\r\n\r\nOstwald, more than any other chemist, has been instrumental in making\r\ngeneral applications of this law, and he made particularly extensive use\r\nof it in connection with analytical chemistry in a book upon this\r\nsubject which he published.\r\n\r\n_The Phase Rule._—In 1876 Willard Gibbs of Yale published a paper in the\r\nProceedings of the Connecticut Academy of Science on the “Equilibrium of\r\nHeterogeneous Substances,” and two years later he published an abstract\r\nof the article in the Journal (=16=, 441, 1878). He had discovered a new\r\nlaw of nature of momentous importance and wide application which is\r\ncalled the “Phase-Rule” and is expressed by a very simple formula.\r\n\r\nThe application of this great discovery to chemical theory was delayed\r\nfor ten years, partly, perhaps, because it was not sufficiently brought\r\nto the attention of chemists, but largely it appears because it was not\r\nat first understood, since its presentation was entirely mathematical.\r\n\r\nIt was Rooseboom, a Dutch chemist, who first applied the phase-rule. It\r\nsoon attracted profound attention, and the name of Willard Gibbs\r\nattained world-wide fame among chemists. When Nernst, who is perhaps the\r\nmost eminent physical chemist of the present time, was delivering the\r\nSilliman Memorial Lectures at Yale a few years ago, he took occasion to\r\nplace a wreath on the grave of Willard Gibbs in recognition of his\r\nachievements.\r\n\r\nTo understand the rule, it is necessary to define the three terms,\r\nintroduced by Gibbs, _phase_, _degrees of freedom_ and _component_.\r\n\r\nBy the first term, is meant the parts of any system of substances which\r\nare mechanically separable. For instance, water in contact with its\r\nvapor has two phases, while a solution of salt and water is composed of\r\nbut one. The degrees of freedom are the number of physical conditions,\r\nincluding pressure, temperature and concentration, which can be varied\r\nindependently in a system without destroying a phase. The exact\r\ndefinition of a component is not so simple, but in general, the\r\ncomponents of a system are the integral parts of which it is composed.\r\nAny system made up of the compound H_{2}O, for instance, whether as ice,\r\nwater or vapor, contains but one component, while a solution of salt and\r\nwater contains two. Letting P, F, and C stand for the three terms, the\r\nphase-rule is simply\r\n\r\n                             F = C + 2 − P\r\n\r\nthat is, the number of degrees of freedom in a system in equilibrium\r\nequals the number of components, plus two, minus the number of phases.\r\nThe rule can be easily understood by means of a simple illustration. In\r\na system composed of ice, water and water vapor, there are three phases\r\nand one component and therefore\r\n\r\n                           F = 1 + 2 − 3 = 0\r\n\r\nSuch a system has no degrees of freedom. This means that no physical\r\ncondition, pressure or temperature can be varied without destroying a\r\nphase, so that such a system can only exist in equilibrium at one fixed\r\ntemperature, with a fixed value for its vapor-pressure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. William Gibbs]\r\n\r\nFor instance, if the system is heated above the fixed temperature, ice\r\ndisappears and if the pressure is raised, vapor is condensed. If this\r\nsame system of water alone contains but two phases, for instance, liquid\r\nand vapor, F = 1 + 2 − 2 = 1, or there is one degree of freedom. In such\r\na system, one physical condition such as temperature can be varied\r\nindependently, but only one, without destroying a phase. For instance,\r\nthe temperature may be raised or lowered, but for every value of\r\ntemperature there is a corresponding value for the vapor-pressure. One\r\nis a function of the other. If both values are varied independently, one\r\nphase will disappear, either vapor condensing entirely to water or the\r\nreverse. Finally if the system consists of one phase only, as water\r\nvapor, F = 2, or the system is divariant, which means that at any given\r\ntemperature it is possible for vapor to exist at varying pressures.\r\n\r\nThe illustration which has been given relates to physical equilibrium,\r\nbut the rule is applicable to cases involving chemical changes as well.\r\nIn comparing the phase-rule with the law of mass action, it will be\r\nnoticed that both have to do with equilibrium. The great advantage of\r\nthe former is that it is entirely independent of the molecular condition\r\nof the substances in the different phases. For instance, it makes no\r\ndifference so far as the application of the rule is concerned, whether a\r\nsubstance in solution is dissociated, undissociated or combined with the\r\nsolvent. In any case, the solution constitutes one phase. On the other\r\nhand, the rule is purely qualitative, giving information only as to\r\nwhether a given change in conditions is possible. The law of mass action\r\nis a quantitative expression so that when the value of the constant is\r\nonce known, the change can be calculated which takes place in the entire\r\nsystem if the concentration of one substance is varied. The law,\r\nhowever, requires a knowledge of the molecular condition of the reacting\r\nsubstances, which may be uncertain or unknown, and chiefly on this\r\naccount it has, like the phase-rule, often only a qualitative\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nThe phase rule has served as a most valuable means of classifying\r\nsystems in equilibrium and as a guide in determining the possible\r\nconditions under which such systems can exist. As illustrations of its\r\npractical application, van’t Hoff used it as an underlying principle in\r\nhis investigations on the conditions under which salt deposits have been\r\nformed in nature, and Rooseboom was able by its means to explain the\r\nvery complicated relations existing in the alloys of iron and carbon\r\nwhich form the various grades of wrought iron, steel and cast iron.\r\n\r\n_Thermochemistry._—This branch of chemistry has to do with heat evolved\r\nor absorbed in chemical reactions. It is important chiefly because in\r\nmany cases it furnishes the only measure we have of the energy changes\r\ninvolved in reactions. To a great extent, it dates from the discovery by\r\nHess in 1840 of a fundamental law which states that the heat evolved in\r\na reaction is the same whether it takes place in one or in several\r\nstages. This law has made it possible to calculate the heat values of a\r\nlarge number of reactions which cannot be determined by direct\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThermochemistry has been developed by a comparatively few men who have\r\ncontributed a surprisingly large number of results. Favre and\r\nSilbermann, beginning shortly after 1850, improved the apparatus for\r\ncalorimetric determinations, which is called the calorimeter, and\r\npublished many results. At about the same time Julius Thomsen, and in\r\n1873 Berthelot, began their remarkable series of publications which\r\ncontinued until recently. Thomsen’s investigations were published in\r\n1882 in =4= volumes. It is probably safe to say that the greater part of\r\nthe data of thermochemistry was obtained by these two investigators. The\r\nbomb calorimeter, an apparatus for determining heat values by direct\r\ncombustion, was developed by Berthelot. The recent work of Mixter at\r\nYale, published in the Journal, and of Richards at Harvard should be\r\nmentioned particularly. Mixter’s work in this field began in 1901 (=12=,\r\n347). Using an improved bomb calorimeter, he has developed a method of\r\ndetermining the heats of formation of oxides by combustion with sodium\r\nperoxide. By this same method as well as by direct combustion in oxygen,\r\nhe has obtained results which appear to equal or excel in accuracy any\r\nwhich have ever been obtained in his field of work. Richards’s work has\r\nconsisted largely of improvements in apparatus. He developed the\r\nso-called adiabatic calorimeter which practically eliminates one of the\r\nchief errors in thermal work caused by the heating or cooling effect of\r\nthe surroundings. This modification is being generally adopted where\r\nextremely accurate work is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Organic Chemistry._\r\n\r\nOne hundred years ago qualitative tests for a few organic compounds were\r\nknown, the elements usually occurring in them were recognized, and some\r\nof them had been analyzed quantitatively, but organic chemistry was far\r\nless advanced than inorganic, and almost the whole of its enormous\r\ndevelopment has taken place during our period.\r\n\r\nBerzelius made a great advance in the subject by establishing the fact,\r\nwhich had been doubted previously, that the elements in organic\r\ncompounds are combined in constant, definite proportions. In 1823 Liebig\r\nbrought to light the exceedingly important fact of isomerism by showing\r\nthat silver fulminate had the same percentage composition as silver\r\ncyanate, a compound of very different properties. Isomeric compounds\r\nwith identical molecular weight as well as the same composition have\r\nsince been found in very many cases, and they have played a most\r\nimportant part in determining the arrangements of atoms in molecules.\r\nThey have been found to be very numerous in many cases. For instance,\r\nthree pentanes with the formula C_{5}H_{12}are known, all that are\r\npossible according to theory, and in each case the structure of the\r\nmolecule has been established. On theoretical grounds it has been\r\ncalculated that 802 isomeric compounds with the formula C_{13}H_{28} are\r\npossible, while with more complex formulas the numbers of isomers may be\r\nvery much greater.\r\n\r\nA particularly interesting case of isomerism was observed by Wöhler in\r\n1828, when he found that ammonium cyanate changes spontaneously into\r\nurea\r\n\r\n                      (NH_{4}CNO → N_{2}H_{4}CO).\r\n\r\nThis was the first synthesis of an organic compound from inorganic\r\nmaterial, and it overthrew the prevailing view that vital forces were\r\nessential in the formation of organic substances. A great many natural\r\norganic compounds have been made artificially since that time, and some\r\nof them, such as artificial alizarin, indigo, oil of wintergreen, and\r\nvanillin, have more or less fully replaced the natural products. The\r\npreparation of a vast number of compounds not known in nature, many of\r\nwhich are of practical importance as medicines, dyes, explosives, etc.,\r\nhas been another great achievement of organic chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe development of our present formulas for organic compounds, by means\r\nof which in many cases the relative positions of the atoms can be shown\r\nwith the greatest confidence, has been gradual. Formulas based on the\r\ndualistic idea of Berzelius were used for some time, type-formulas, with\r\nthe employment of compound radicals, came later, the substitution of\r\natoms or groups of atoms for others in chemical reactions came to be\r\nrecognized, but one of the most important steps was the recognition of\r\nthe quadrivalence of carbon and the general application of valency to\r\natoms by Kekulé about 1858. This led directly to the use of modern\r\nstructural formulas which have been of the greatest value in the\r\ntheoretical interpretation of organic reactions. It was Kekulé also who\r\nproposed the hexagonal ring-formula for benzene, C_{6}H_{6}, which led\r\nto exceedingly important theoretical and practical developments. The\r\ndetails of the formulas for many other rings and complex structures have\r\nbeen established since that time, and there is no doubt that the\r\nremarkable achievements in organic chemistry during the past sixty years\r\nhave been much facilitated by the use of these formulas.\r\n\r\nMany important researches in organic chemistry have been carried out in\r\nthe United States, and the activity in this direction has greatly\r\nincreased in recent years. In this connection the large amount of work\r\nof this kind accomplished in the Sheffield Laboratory, at present under\r\nthe guidance of Professor T. B. Johnson, should be mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt has happened that comparatively few publications on organic chemistry\r\nhave appeared in the Journal, but it may be stated that the preparation\r\nof chloroform and its physiological effects were described by Guthrie\r\n(=21=, 64, 1832). Unknown to him, it had been prepared by Souberain, a\r\nFrench chemist, the previous year, but the former was the first to\r\ndescribe its physiological action. Silliman gave a sample to Doctor Eli\r\nIves of the Yale Medical School, who used it to relieve a case of\r\nasthma. This was the first use of chloroform in medical practice (=21=,\r\n405, 1832). Guthrie also described in the Journal (=21=, 284, 1832) his\r\nnew process for converting potato starch into glucose, a method which is\r\nessentially the same as that used to-day in converting cornstarch into\r\nglucose. Lawrence Smith (=43=, 301, 1842 _et seq._), Horsford (=3=, 369,\r\n1847 _et seq._), Sterry Hunt (=7=, 399, 1849), Carey Lea (=26=, 379,\r\n1858 _et seq._), Remsen (=5=, 179, 1873 _et seq._), and others have\r\ncontributed articles on organic chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Agricultural Chemistry._\r\n\r\nUntil near the middle of the nineteenth century, it was believed that\r\nplants, like animals, used organic matter for food, and depended chiefly\r\nupon the humus of the soil for their growth. This view was held even\r\nlong after it was known that plant leaves absorb carbon dioxide and give\r\noff oxygen, and after the ashes of plants had been accurately analyzed.\r\n\r\nThis incorrect view was overthrown by the celebrated German chemist,\r\nLiebig, who made many investigations upon the subject, and, properly\r\ninterpreting previous knowledge, published a book in 1840 upon the\r\napplication of chemistry to agriculture and physiology in which he\r\nmaintained that the nutritive materials of all green plants are\r\ninorganic substances, namely, carbon dioxide, water, ammonia (nitrates),\r\nsulphates, phosphates, silica, lime, magnesia, potash, iron, and\r\nsometimes common salt. He drew the vastly important conclusion that the\r\neffective fertilization of soils depends upon replenishing the inorganic\r\nsubstances that have been exhausted by the crops.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principles set forth by Liebig have been confirmed, and\r\nit has been found that the fertilizing constituents most commonly\r\nlacking in soils are nitrogen compounds, phosphates, and potassium\r\nsalts, so that these have formed the important constituents of\r\nartificial fertilizers. Liebig himself found that humus is valuable in\r\nsoils, because it absorbs and retains the soluble salts.\r\n\r\nThe foundation established by Liebig in regard to artificial fertilizers\r\nhas led to an enormous application of these materials, much to the\r\nadvantage of the world’s food supply.\r\n\r\nIt was Liebig’s belief, in accordance with the prevailing views, that\r\ndecay and putrefaction as well as alcoholic and other fermentations were\r\nspontaneous processes, and when the eminent French chemist, Pasteur, in\r\n1857, explained fermentation as directly caused by yeast, an\r\nepoch-making discovery which led to the explanation of decay and\r\nputrefaction by bacterial action and to the germ-theory of disease, the\r\nexplanation was violently opposed by Liebig and other German chemists.\r\nPasteur’s view prevailed, however, and since that time it has been found\r\nthat various kinds of bacteria are responsible for the formation of\r\nammonia from nitrogenous organic matter and also for the change of\r\nammonia into the nitrates that are available as plant-food.\r\n\r\nThe long-debated question as to the availability of atmospheric nitrogen\r\nfor plant-food was settled in 1886 by the discovery of Hellriegel that\r\nbacteria contained in nodules on the roots, especially of leguminous\r\nplants, are capable of bringing nitrogen into combination and furnishing\r\nit to the plants.\r\n\r\nNo more than an allusion can be made to agricultural experiment stations\r\nwhere soils, fertilizers, foods and other products are examined, and\r\nwhere other problems connected with agriculture are studied.\r\n\r\nThe late S. W. Johnson of Yale studied with Liebig and subsequently did\r\nmuch service for agricultural chemistry in this country, by his\r\ninvestigations, his teaching, and his writings. His book, “How Crops\r\nGrow,” published in 1868, gave an excellent account of the principles of\r\nagricultural chemistry. He did much to bring about the establishment of\r\nagricultural experiment stations in this country, and for a long time he\r\nwas the director of the Connecticut Station.\r\n\r\nIn the Journal, as early as 1827, Amos Eaton (=12=, 370) published a\r\nsimple method for the mechanical analysis of soils to determine their\r\nsuitability for wheat-culture, and Hilgard, between 1872 and 1874,\r\ndescribed an elaborate study of soil-analysis. J. P. Norton, a Yale\r\nprofessor, in 1847 (=3=, 322) published an investigation on the analysis\r\nof the oat, which was awarded a prize of fifty sovereigns by a Scotch\r\nagricultural society, while Johnson, Atwater, and others have\r\ncontributed articles on the analysis of various farm products.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Industrial Acids and Alkalies._\r\n\r\nOne hundred years ago sulphuric acid was manufactured on a comparatively\r\nvery small scale in lead chambers. In 1818, an English manufacturer of\r\nthe acid introduced the modern feature of using pyrites in the place of\r\nbrimstone, while the Gay-Lussac tower in 1827 and the Glover tower in\r\n1859 began to be applied as great improvements in the chamber process.\r\nWithin about twenty years the contact process, employing platinized\r\nasbestos, has replaced the old chamber process to a large extent. It has\r\nthe advantage of producing the concentrated acid, or the fuming acid,\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\nDuring our period the manufacture of sulphuric acid has increased\r\nenormously. Very large quantities of it have been used in connection\r\nwith the Leblanc soda process in its rapid development. It came to be\r\nemployed extensively for absorbing ammonia in the illuminating-gas\r\nindustry, which was in its infancy one hundred years ago. New industries\r\nsuch as the manufacture of “superphosphates” as artificial fertilizers,\r\nthe refining of petroleum, the manufacture of artificial dyestuffs and\r\nmany other modern chemical products have greatly increased the demand\r\nfor it, while its employment in the production of nitric and other\r\nacids, and for many other purposes not already mentioned, has been very\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of nitric acid has been greatly extended during our\r\nperiod on account of its employment for producing explosives, artificial\r\ndyestuffs, and for many other purposes. Chile saltpeter became available\r\nfor making it about 1852. This acid has been manufactured recently from\r\natmospheric nitrogen and oxygen by combining them by the aid of powerful\r\nelectric discharges. This process has been used chiefly in Norway where\r\nwater-power is abundant, as it requires a large expenditure of energy. A\r\nstill more recent method for the production of nitric acid depends upon\r\nthe oxidation of ammonia by air with the aid of a contact substance,\r\nsuch as platinized asbestos.\r\n\r\nThe production of ammonia, which was very small a hundred years ago, has\r\nbeen vastly increased in connection with the development of the\r\nilluminating-gas industry and the employment of by-product coke ovens.\r\nThis substance is very extensively used in refrigerating machines and\r\nalso in a great many chemical operations, including the Solvay soda\r\nprocess. Ammonium salts are of great importance also as fertilizers in\r\nagriculture. The conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia on a\r\ncommercial scale is a recent achievement. It has been accomplished by\r\nheating calcium carbide, an electric-furnace product made from lime and\r\ncoke, with nitrogen gas, thus producing calcium cyanamide, and then\r\ntreating this cyanamide with water under proper conditions. Another\r\nmethod devised by Haber consists in directly combining nitrogen and\r\nhydrogen gases under high pressure with the aid of a contact substance.\r\n\r\nLeblanc’s method for obtaining sodium carbonate from sodium chloride by\r\nfirst converting the latter into the sulphate by means of sulphuric acid\r\nand then heating the sulphate with lime and coal in a furnace was\r\ninvented as early as 1791, but it was not rapidly developed and did not\r\ngain a foothold in England until 1826 on account of a high duty on salt\r\nup to that time. Afterwards the process flourished greatly in connection\r\nwith the sulphuric acid industry upon which it depended, and with the\r\nbleaching-powder industry which utilized the hydrochloric acid\r\nincidentally produced by it, and, of course, in connection with soap\r\nmanufacture and many other industries in which the soda itself was\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nAbout 1866 the Solvay process appeared as a rival to the Leblanc\r\nprocess. This depends upon the precipitation of sodium bicarbonate from\r\nsalt solutions by means of carbon dioxide and ammonia, with the\r\nsubsequent recovery of the ammonia. It has displaced the older process\r\nto a large extent, and it is carried on extensively in this country, for\r\ninstance, at Syracuse, New York.\r\n\r\nOther processes for soda depend upon the electrolysis of sodium chloride\r\nsolutions. In this case caustic soda and chlorine are the direct\r\nproducts, and the chlorine thus produced and liquefied by pressure in\r\nsteel cylinders, has become an important commercial article.\r\n\r\nIn earlier times wood-ashes were the source of potash and potassium\r\nsalts. Wurtz in the Journal (=10=, 326, 1850) suggested the availability\r\nof New Jersey greensand as a source of potash and showed how this\r\nmineral could be decomposed, but it does not appear that this mineral\r\nhas ever been utilized for the purpose. About 1861 the German\r\npotash-salt deposits began to be developed, and these have since become\r\nthe chief source of this material. At present many efforts are being\r\nmade to obtain potassium compounds from other sources, such as brines,\r\ncement-kiln dust, and feldspar and other minerals but thus far the\r\nresults have not satisfied the demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Conclusion._\r\n\r\nThis account of chemical progress has given only a limited view of small\r\nportions of the subject, because the amount of available material is so\r\nvast in comparison with the space allowed for its presentation. Since\r\nthe Journal has published comparatively little organic chemistry, it was\r\ndecided to make room for a better presentation of other things by giving\r\nonly a brief discussion of this exceedingly active and important branch\r\nof the science. For similar reasons industrial and metallurgical\r\nchemistry, and other branches besides, in spite of their great growth\r\nand importance, have been neglected, except for some incidental\r\nreferences to them, and some account of a few of the more important\r\nindustrial chemicals.\r\n\r\nIt appears that we have much reason to be proud of the advances in\r\nchemistry that have been made during the Journal’s period, and of the\r\npart that the Journal has taken in connection with them, and there seems\r\nto be no doubt that this progress has not diminished during more recent\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe present tendency of chemical research is evidently towards a still\r\ngreater development of organic chemistry, and an increased application\r\nof physics and mathematics to chemical theory and practice.\r\n\r\nThe very great improvements that have been made in chemical education,\r\nboth in the number of students and the quality of instruction, during\r\nthe period under discussion, and particularly in rather recent times,\r\ngives promise for excellent future progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _Note._\r\n\r\nFootnote 153:\r\n\r\n  It appears that the most accurate experimental demonstration ever made\r\n  of this law was that of E. W. Morley, published in the Journal (=41=,\r\n  220, 276, 1891). He showed that 2·0002 volumes of hydrogen combine\r\n  with one volume of oxygen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XI\r\n                    A CENTURY’S PROGRESS IN PHYSICS\r\n\r\n                             By LEIGH PAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n _Dynamics._—At the beginning of the nineteenth century mechanics was\r\nthe only major branch of physical science which had attained any\r\nconsiderable degree of development. Two centuries earlier, Galileo’s\r\nexperiments on the rate of fall of iron balls dropped from the top of\r\nthe Leaning Tower of Pisa, had marked the origin of dynamics. He had\r\neasily disproved the prevalent idea that even under conditions where air\r\nresistance is negligible heavy bodies would fall more rapidly than light\r\nones, and further experiments had led him to conclude that the increase\r\nin velocity is proportional to the _time_ elapsed, and not to the\r\n_distance_ traversed, as he had at first supposed. Less than a century\r\nlater Newton had formulated the laws of motion in the same words in\r\nwhich they are given to-day. These laws of motion, coupled with his\r\ndiscovery of the law of universal gravitation, had enabled him to\r\ncorrelate at once the planetary notions which had proved so puzzling to\r\nhis predecessors. His success gave a tremendous stimulus to the\r\ndevelopment and extension of the fundamental dynamical principles that\r\nhe had brought to light, which culminated in the work of the great\r\nFrench mathematicians, Lagrange and Laplace, a little over a hundred\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nNewton’s laws of motion, it must be remembered, apply only to a\r\nparticle, or to those bodies which can be treated as particles in the\r\nproblem under consideration. In his “Mécanique Analytique” Lagrange\r\nextended these principles so as to make it possible to treat the motion\r\nof a connected system by a method almost as simple as that contained in\r\nthe second law of motion. Instead of three scalar equations for each of\r\nthe innumerably large number of particles involved, he showed how to\r\nreduce the ordinary dynamical equations to a number equal to that of the\r\ndegrees of freedom of the system. This is made possible by a combination\r\nof d’Alembert’s principle, which eliminates the forces due to the\r\nconnections between the particles, and the principle of virtual work,\r\nwhich confines the number of equations to the number of possible\r\nindependent displacements. The aim of Lagrange was to make dynamics into\r\na branch of analysis, and his success may be inferred from the fact that\r\nnot a single diagram or geometrical figure is to be found in his great\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n_Celestial Mechanics._—Almost simultaneously with the publication of the\r\n“Mécanique Analytique” appeared Laplace’s “Mécanique Celeste.” Laplace’s\r\navowed aim was to offer a complete solution of the great dynamical\r\nproblem involved in the solar system, taking into account, in addition\r\nto the effect of the sun’s gravitational field, those perturbations in\r\nthe motion of each planet caused by the approach and recession of its\r\nneighbors. So successful was his analysis of planetary motions that his\r\ncontemporaries believed that they were not far from a complete\r\nexplanation of the world on mechanical principles. Laplace himself was\r\nundoubtedly convinced that nothing was needed beyond a knowledge of the\r\nmasses, positions, and initial velocities of every material particle in\r\nthe universe in order to completely predetermine all subsequent motion.\r\n\r\nThe greatest triumph of these dynamical methods was to come half a\r\ncentury later. The planet Uranus, discovered in 1781 by the elder\r\nHerschel, was at that time the farthest known planet from the sun. But\r\nthe orbit of Uranus was subject to some puzzling variations. After\r\nsifting all the known causes of these disturbances, Leverrier in France\r\nand Adams in England independently reached the conclusion that another\r\nplanet still more remote from the sun must be responsible, and computed\r\nits orbit. Leverrier communicated to Galle of Berlin the results of his\r\ncalculations, and during the next few days the German astronomer\r\ndiscovered Neptune within one degree of its predicted position!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H. A. Newton]\r\n\r\nWe shall mention but one other achievement of the methods of celestial\r\nmechanics. Those visitors of the skies, the comets, which become so\r\nprominent only to fade away and vanish perhaps forever, had interested\r\nastronomers from the earliest times. Soon after the discovery of the law\r\nof gravitation, Newton had worked out a method by which the elements of\r\na comet’s orbit can be computed from observations of its position. It\r\nwas found that the great majority of these bodies move in nearly\r\nparabolic paths and only a few in ellipses. Of the latter the most\r\nprominent is the brilliant comet first observed by Halley in 1681. It\r\nhas reappeared regularly at intervals of seventy-six years; the last\r\nappearance in the spring of 1910 is no doubt well remembered by the\r\nreader. Kant had considered comets to be formed by condensing solar\r\nnebulæ, whereas Laplace had maintained that they originate in matter\r\nwhich is scattered throughout stellar space and has no connection with\r\nthe solar system. A study of the distribution of inclinations of comet\r\norbits by H. A. Newton (=16=, 165, 1878) of New Haven substantiated\r\nLaplace’s hypothesis, and led to the conclusion that the periodic comets\r\nhave been captured by the attraction of those planets near to which they\r\nhave passed. Of these comets a number have comparatively short periods,\r\nand are found to have orbits which are in general only slightly inclined\r\nto those of the planets, and are traversed in the same direction.\r\nMoreover, the fact that the orbit of each of these comets comes very\r\nclose to that of Jupiter made it seem probable that they have been\r\nattached to the solar system by the attraction of this planet. Further\r\nconfirmation of this hypothesis was furnished by H. A. Newton’s (=42=,\r\n183 and 482, 1891) explanation of the small inclination of their orbits\r\nand the scarcity of retrograde motions among them.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 occurred one of the greatest meteoric showers of history.\r\nOlmstead (=26=, 132, 1834) and Twining (=26=, 320, 1834) of New Haven\r\nnoticed that these shooting stars traverse parallel paths, and were the\r\nfirst to suggest that they must be moving in swarms in a permanent\r\norbit. From an examination of all accessible records, H. A. Newton\r\n(=37=, 377, 1864; =38=, 53, 1864) was able to show that meteoric showers\r\nare common in November, and of particular intensity at intervals of 33\r\nor 34 years. He confidently predicted a great shower for Nov. 13th,\r\n1866, which not only actually occurred but was followed by another a\r\nyear later, showing that the meteoric swarm extended so far as to\r\nrequire two years to cross the earth’s orbit. H. A. Newton (=36=, 1,\r\n1888) in America and Adams in England took up the study of meteoric\r\norbits with great interest, and the former concluded that these orbits\r\nare in every sense similar to those of the periodic comets, implying\r\nthat a swarm of meteors originates in the disintegration of a comet. In\r\nfact Schiaparelli actually identified the orbit of the Perseids, or\r\nAugust meteors, with Tuttle’s comet of 1862, and shortly after the orbit\r\nof the Leonids, or November meteors, was found to be the same as that of\r\nTempel’s comet.\r\n\r\n_Electromagnetism._—During the eighteenth century much interest had been\r\nmanifested in the study of electrostatics and magnetism. Du Fay,\r\nCavendish, Michell and Coulomb abroad and Franklin in America had\r\nsubjected to experimental investigation many of the phenomena of one or\r\nboth of these sciences, and in the early years of the nineteenth century\r\nPoisson developed to a remarkable extent the analytical consequences of\r\nthe law of force which experiment had revealed. Both Laplace and he made\r\nmuch use of the function to which Green gave the name “potential” in\r\n1828, and which is such a powerful aid in solving problems involving\r\nmagnetism or electricity at rest.\r\n\r\nMeantime electric currents had been brought under the hand of the\r\nexperimenter by the discoveries of Galvani and Volta. Large numbers of\r\ncells were connected in series, and interest seemed to lie largely in\r\nproducing brilliant sparks or fusing metals by means of a heavy current.\r\nHare (=3=, 105, 1821) of the University of Pennsylvania constructed a\r\nbattery consisting of two troughs of forty cells each, so arranged that\r\nthe coppers and zincs can be lowered simultaneously into the acid and\r\nlarge currents obtained before polarization has a chance to interfere.\r\nThis “deflagrator” was used to ignite charcoal in the circuit, or melt\r\nfine wires, and was for some time the most powerful arrangement of its\r\nkind. That “galvanism” is something quite different from static\r\nelectricity was the opinion of many investigators; Hare considered the\r\nheat developed to be the distinguishing mark of the electric current. He\r\nsays: “It is admitted that the action of the galvanic fluid is upon or\r\nbetween atoms; while mechanical electricity when uncoerced, acts only\r\nupon masses. This difference has not been explained unless by my\r\nhypothesis, in which caloric, of which the influence is only exerted\r\nbetween atoms, is supposed to be a principal agent in galvanism.”\r\n\r\nQuestioning minds were beginning to suspect that there must be some\r\nconnection between electricity and magnetism. For lightning had been\r\nknown to make magnets of steel knives and forks, and Franklin had\r\nmagnetized a sewing needle by the discharge from a Leyden jar. Finally\r\nOersted of Copenhagen undertook systematic investigation of the effect\r\nof electricity on the magnetic needle. His researches were without\r\nresult until during the course of a series of lectures on “Electricity,\r\nGalvanism, and Magnetism” delivered during the winter of 1819–20 it\r\noccurred to him to investigate the action of an electric current on a\r\nmagnetic needle. At first he placed the wire bearing the current at\r\nright angles to the needle, with, of course, no result; then it occurred\r\nto him to place it parallel. A deflection was observed, for to his\r\nsurprise the needle insisted on turning until perpendicular to the wire.\r\n\r\nOersted’s discovery that an electric current exerts a couple on a\r\nmagnetic needle was followed a few months later by Ampère’s\r\ndemonstration before the French Academy that two currents flowing in the\r\nsame direction attract each other, while two in opposite directions\r\nrepel. The story goes that a critic attempted to belittle this discovery\r\nby remarking that as it was known that two currents act on one and the\r\nsame magnet, it was obvious that they would act upon each other.\r\nWhereupon Arago arose to defend his friend. Drawing two keys out of his\r\npocket he said, “Each of these keys attracts a magnet; do you believe\r\nthat they therefore attract each other?”\r\n\r\nA few years later Ampère showed how to express quantitatively the force\r\nbetween current elements, and indeed developed to a considerable degree\r\nthe equivalence between a closed circuit carrying a current and a\r\nmagnetic shell. So convincing was his analysis and so thorough his\r\ndiscussion of the subject, that Maxwell said of this memoir half a\r\ncentury later, “The whole, theory and experiment, seems as if it had\r\nleaped, full grown and full armed, from the brain of the ‘Newton of\r\nelectricity.’ It is perfect in form and unassailable in accuracy; and it\r\nis summed up in a formula from which all the phenomena may be deduced,\r\nand which must always remain the cardinal formula of electrodynamics.”\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards the dependence of a current on the conductivity of\r\nthe wire used and the grouping of cells employed, was made clear by the\r\nwork of Ohm. Many of his results were obtained independently by Joseph\r\nHenry (=19=, 400, 1831) of the Albany Academy, who described in 1831 a\r\npowerful electromagnet in which a great many coils of wire insulated\r\nwith silk were wound around an iron core and connected in parallel with\r\na single cell. He remarks in this paper that with long wires, as in the\r\ntelegraph, many cells arranged in series should be used, whereas for\r\nseveral short wires connected in parallel a single cell with large\r\nplates is more efficient.\r\n\r\n_Current Induction._—Impressed by the fact that electric charges have\r\nthe power of inducing other charges on neighboring conductors without\r\ncoming into contact with them, Faraday was engaged in investigating the\r\npossibility of an analogous phenomenon in the case of electric currents.\r\nHis idea at first seems to have been that a current should induce\r\nanother current in any closed conducting circuit which happens to be in\r\nits vicinity. Experiment readily showed the falsity of this conception,\r\nbut a brief deflection of the galvanometer in the secondary circuit was\r\nnoticed at the instant of making and breaking the current in the\r\nprimary. Further experiments showed that thrusting a permanent steel\r\nmagnet into a coil connected to a galvanometer caused the needle to\r\ndeflect. In fact Faraday’s report to the Royal Society on November 24th,\r\n1831, contains a complete account of all experimental methods available\r\nfor inducing a current in a closed circuit.\r\n\r\nWhile Faraday is entitled to credit for the discovery of current\r\ninduction by virtue of the priority of his publication, it must not pass\r\nunnoticed that Henry obtained many of the same experimental results\r\nindependently and some even earlier. Henry was at this time instructor\r\nin mathematics at the Albany Academy, and seven hours of teaching a day\r\nmade it well nigh impossible to carry on original research except during\r\nthe vacation month of August. As early as the summer of 1830 he had\r\nwound 30 feet of copper wire around the armature of a horseshoe\r\nelectromagnet and connected it to a galvanometer. When the magnet was\r\nexcited, a momentary deflection was observed. “I was, however, much\r\nsurprised,” he says, “to see the needle suddenly deflected from a state\r\nof rest to about 20° to the east, or in a contrary direction, when the\r\nbattery was withdrawn from the acid, and again deflected to the west\r\nwhen it was re-immersed.” In addition a deflection was obtained by\r\ndetaching the armature from the magnet, or by bringing it again into\r\ncontact. Had the results of these experiments been published promptly,\r\nAmerica would have been entitled to credit for the most important\r\ndiscovery of the greatest of England’s many great experimenters. But\r\nHenry desired first to repeat his experiments on a larger scale, and\r\nwhile new magnets were being constructed, the news of Faraday’s\r\ndiscovery arrived. This occasioned hasty publication of the work already\r\ndone in an appendix to volume =22=, 1832, of the Journal.\r\n\r\nAt almost the same time Henry made another important discovery and this\r\ntime he was anticipated by no other investigator in making public his\r\nresults. In the paper already referred to be describes the phenomenon\r\nknown to-day as self-induction. “When a small battery is moderately\r\nexcited by diluted acid and its poles, which must be terminated by cups\r\nof mercury, are connected by a copper wire not more than a foot in\r\nlength, no spark is perceived when the connection is either formed or\r\nbroken; but if a wire thirty or forty feet long be used, instead of the\r\nshort wire, though no spark will be perceptible when the connection is\r\nmade, yet when it is broken by drawing one end of the wire from its cup\r\nof mercury a vivid spark is produced.... The effect appears somewhat\r\nincreased by coiling the wire into a helix; it seems to depend in some\r\nmeasure on the length and thickness of the wire; I can account for these\r\nphenomena only by supposing the long wire to become charged with\r\nelectricity which by its reaction on itself projects a spark when the\r\nconnection is broken.”\r\n\r\nSoon after, Henry went to Princeton and there continued his experiments\r\nin electromagnetism. No difficulty was experienced in inducing currents\r\nof the third, fourth and fifth orders by using the first secondary as\r\nprimary for yet another secondary circuit, and so on (=38=, 209, 1840).\r\nThe directions of these currents of higher orders when the primary is\r\nmade or broken proved puzzling at first, but were satisfactorily\r\nexplained a year later (=41=, 117, 1841). In addition induced currents\r\nwere obtained from a Leyden jar discharge. Faraday failed to find any\r\nscreening effect of a conducting cylinder placed around the primary and\r\ninside the secondary. Henry examined the matter, and found that the\r\nscreening effect exists only when the induced current is due to a make\r\nor break of the primary circuit, and not when it is caused by motion of\r\nthe primary.\r\n\r\nHenry’s work was mainly descriptive; it remained for Faraday to develop\r\na theory to account for the phenomena discovered and to prepare the way\r\nfor quantitative formulation of the laws of current induction. This he\r\ndid in his representation of a magnetic field by means of lines of\r\nforce; a conception which he found afterwards to be equally valuable\r\nwhen applied to electrostatic problems. Every magnet and every current\r\ngives rise to these closed curves; in the case of a magnet they thread\r\nit from south pole to north, while a straight wire bearing a current is\r\nsurrounded by concentric rings. The connection between lines of force\r\nand the induction of currents is contained in the rule that a current is\r\ninduced in a closed circuit only when a change takes place in the number\r\nof lines of force passing through it. Furthermore the dependence of the\r\ncurrent strength on the conductivity of the wire employed has led to\r\nrecognition of the fact that it is the electromotive force and not the\r\ncurrent itself which is conditioned by the change in magnetic flux.\r\n\r\nGreat interest was attached to the utilization of the newly discovered\r\nforces of electromagnetism. In 1831 Henry (=20=, 340, 1831) described a\r\nreciprocating engine depending on magnetic attraction and repulsion, and\r\nC. G. Page (=33=, 118, 1838; =49=, 131, 1845) devised many others. The\r\nlatter’s most important work, however, was the invention of the\r\nRuhmkorff coil. In 1836 (=31=, 137, 1837) he found the strongest shocks\r\nto be obtained, from a secondary coil of many windings forming a\r\ncontinuation of a primary of half the number of turns. His perfection of\r\nthe self-acting circuit breaker (=35=, 252, 1839) widened the usefulness\r\nof the induction coil, and his substitution of a bundle of iron wires\r\nfor a solid iron core (=34=, 163, 1838) greatly increased its\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\n_Conservation of Energy._—Perhaps the most important advance of the\r\nnineteenth century has been the establishment of the principle of\r\nconservation of energy. Despite the fact that the “principe de la\r\nconservation des force vives” had been recognized by the French\r\nmathematicians of the early part of the century, the application of this\r\nprinciple even to purely mechanical problems was contested by some\r\nscientists. Through the early numbers of the Journal runs a lively\r\ncontroversy as to whether there is not a loss of power involved in\r\nimparting momentum to the reciprocating parts of a steam engine only to\r\ncheck the motion later on in the stroke. Finally Isaac Doolittle (=14=,\r\n60, 1828), of the Bennington Iron Works, ends the discussion by the\r\npertinent remark: “If there be, as is contended by one of your\r\ncorrespondents, a loss of more than one third of the power, in\r\ntransforming an alternating rectilinear movement into a continuous\r\ncircular one by means of a crank, I should like to be informed what\r\nwould be the effect if the proposition were reversed, as in the case of\r\nthe common saw mill, and in many other instances in practical\r\nmechanics.”\r\n\r\nA realization of the equivalence of heat and mechanical work did not\r\ncome until the middle of the century, in spite of the conclusive\r\nexperiments of the American Count Rumford and the English Davy before\r\nthe year 1800. So firmly enthroned was the caloric theory, according to\r\nwhich heat is an indestructible fluid, that evidence against it was\r\ngiven scant consideration. In fact the success of the analytical method\r\nintroduced by Fourier in 1822 for the solution of problems in conduction\r\nof heat only added to the difficulties of the adherents of the kinetic\r\ntheory. But recognition of heat as a form of energy was on the way, and\r\nwhen it came it made its appearance almost simultaneously in half a\r\ndozen different places. Perhaps Robert Mayer of Heilbronn was the first\r\nto state explicitly the new principle. His paper “On the Forces of\r\nInorganic Nature” was refused publication in Poggendorff’s Annalen, but\r\nfared better at the hands of another editor. During the next few years\r\nJoule determined the mechanical equivalent of heat experimentally by a\r\nnumber of different methods, some of which had already been devised by\r\nCarnot. Of those he used, the most familiar consists in churning up a\r\nmeasured mass of water by means of paddles actuated by falling weights\r\nand calculating the heat developed from the rise in temperature.\r\nHowever, the work of the young Manchester brewer received little\r\nattention from the members of the British Association before whom it was\r\nreported until Kelvin showed them its significance and attracted their\r\ninterest to it. Meanwhile Helmholtz had completed a very thorough\r\ndisquisition on the conservation of energy not only in dynamics and heat\r\nbut in other departments of physics as well. His paper on “Die Erhaltung\r\nder Kraft” was frowned upon by the members of the Physical Society of\r\nBerlin before whom he read it, and received the same treatment as\r\nMayer’s from the editor of Poggendorff’s Annalen. Helmholtz’s “Kraft,”\r\nlike the “vis viva” of other writers, is the quantity which Young had\r\nalready christened energy. Not many years elapsed, however, until the\r\nconvictions of Mayer, Joule, Kelvin and Helmholtz became the most\r\nclearly recognized of all physical principles. As early as 1850 Jeremiah\r\nDay (=10=, 174, 1850), late president of Yale College, admitted the\r\nimprobability of constructing a machine capable of perpetual motion,\r\neven though the “imponderable agents” of electricity, galvanism and\r\nmagnetism be utilized.\r\n\r\n_Thermodynamics._—The importance of the principle of conservation of\r\nenergy lies in the fact that it unites under one rule such diverse\r\nphenomena as gravitation, electromagnetism, heat and chemical action.\r\nAnother principle as universal in its scope, although depending upon the\r\ncoarseness of human observations for its validity rather than upon the\r\nimmutable laws of nature, was foreshadowed even before the first law of\r\nthermodynamics, or principle of conservation of energy, was clearly\r\nrecognized. This second law was the consequence of efforts to improve\r\nthe efficiency of heat engines. In 1824 Carnot introduced the conception\r\nof cyclic operations into the theory of such engines. Assuming the\r\nimpossibility of perpetual motion, he showed that no engine can have an\r\nefficiency greater than that of a reversible engine. Finally Clausius\r\nexpressed concisely the principle toward which Carnot’s work had been\r\nleading, when he asserted that “it is impossible for a self-acting\r\nmachine, unaided by any external agency, to convey heat from one body to\r\nanother at a higher temperature.” Kelvin’s formulation of the same law\r\nstates that “it is impossible, by means of inanimate material agency, to\r\nderive mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cooling it below\r\nthe temperature of the coldest of the surrounding objects.”\r\n\r\nThe consequences of the second law were rapidly developed by Kelvin,\r\nClausius, Rankine, Barnard (=16=, 218, 1853, _et seq._) and others.\r\nKelvin introduced the thermodynamic scale of temperature, which he\r\nshowed to be independent of such properties of matter as condition the\r\nsize of the degree indicated by the mercury thermometer. This scale,\r\nwhich is equivalent to that of the ideal gas thermometer, was used\r\nsubsequently by Rowland in his exhaustive determination of the\r\nmechanical equivalent of heat by an improved form of Joule’s method. He\r\nfound different values for different ranges in temperature, showing that\r\nthe specific heat of water is by no means constant. Since then\r\nelectrical methods of measuring this important quantity have been used\r\nto confirm the results of purely mechanical determinations.\r\n\r\nThe definition of a new quantity, entropy, was found necessary for a\r\nmathematical formulation of the second law of thermodynamics. This\r\nquantity, which acts as a measure of the unavailability of heat energy,\r\nwas given a new significance when Boltzmann showed its connection with\r\nthe probability of the thermodynamic state of the substance under\r\nconsideration. If two bodies have widely different temperatures, a large\r\namount of the heat energy of the system is available for conversion into\r\nmechanical work. From the macroscopic point of view this is expressed by\r\nsaying that the entropy is small, or if the motions of the individual\r\nmolecules are taken into account, the probability of the state is low.\r\nThe interpretation of entropy as the logarithm of the thermodynamic\r\nprobability has thrown much light on the meaning of this rather abstruse\r\nquantity. Gibbs’s “Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics”\r\ntreats in detail the fundamental assumptions involved in this point of\r\nview, its limitations and its consequences. In his “Equilibrium of\r\nHeterogeneous Substances”[154] he had already extended the principle of\r\nthermal equilibrium to include substances which are no longer\r\nhomogeneous. The value of the chemical potential he introduced\r\ndetermines whether one phase is to gain at the expense of another or\r\nlose to it. It is unfortunate that the analytical rigor and austerity of\r\nhis reasoning combined with lack of mathematical training on the part of\r\nthe average chemist, delayed true appreciation of his work and full\r\nutilization of the new field which he opened up.\r\n\r\n_Liquefaction of Gases._—Meanwhile the problem of liquefying gases was\r\nattracting much attention on the part of experimental physicists.\r\nFaraday had succeeded in making liquid a number of substances which had\r\nhitherto been known only in the gaseous state. His method consists in\r\nevolving the gas from chemicals placed in one end of a bent tube, the\r\nother end of which is immersed in a freezing mixture. The high pressure\r\ncaused by the production of the gas combined with the low temperature is\r\nsufficient to bring about liquefaction in many cases. Failure with other\r\nmore permanent gases was unexplained until the researches of Andrews in\r\n1863 showed that no amount of pressure will produce liquefaction unless\r\nthe temperature is below a certain critical value. The method of\r\nreducing the temperature in use to-day depends on a fact discovered by\r\nKelvin and Joule in connection with the free expansion of a gas. These\r\ninvestigators allowed the gas to escape through a porous plug from a\r\nchamber in which the pressure was relatively high. With the single\r\nexception of hydrogen, the effect of the sudden expansion is to cool the\r\ngas, and even with it cooling is found to take place after the\r\ntemperature has been made sufficiently low. By this method all known\r\ngases have been liquefied. Helium, with a boiling point of –269°C, or\r\nonly 4°C. above the absolute zero, was the last to be made a liquid,\r\nfinally yielding to the efforts of Kammerlingh Onnes in 1907. This\r\ninvestigator[155] finds that at temperatures near the absolute zero the\r\nelectrical conductivity of certain substances undergoes a profound\r\nmodification. For example, a coil of lead shows a superconductivity so\r\ngreat that a current once started in it persists for days after the\r\nelectromotive force has ceased to act.\r\n\r\n_Electrodynamics._—Faraday’s representation of electric and magnetic\r\nfields by lines of force had been of great value in predicting the\r\nresults of experiments in electromagnetism. But a more mathematical\r\nformulation of the laws governing these phenomena was needed in order to\r\nmake possible quantitative development of the theory. This was supplied\r\nby Maxwell in his epoch-making treatise on “Electricity and Magnetism.”\r\nStarting with electrostatics and magnetism, he gives a complete account\r\nof the mathematical methods which had been devised for the solution of\r\nproblems in these branches of the subject, and then turning to Ampère’s\r\nwork he shows how the Lagrangian equations of motion lead to Faraday’s\r\nlaw if the single assumption is made that the magnetic energy of the\r\nfield is kinetic. In the treatment of open circuits Maxwell’s intuition\r\nled to a great advance, the introduction of the displacement current.\r\nConsider a charged condenser, the plates of which are suddenly connected\r\nby a wire. A current will flow through the wire from the positively\r\ncharged plate to the negative, but in the gap between the two plates the\r\nconduction current is missing. So convinced was Maxwell that currents\r\nmust always flow in _closed_ circuits, that he postulated an electrical\r\ndisplacement in the medium between the plates of a charged condenser,\r\nwhich disappears when the condenser is short-circuited. Thus even in the\r\nso-called open circuit the current flows along a closed path.\r\n\r\nMaxwell’s theory of the electromagnetic field is based essentially on\r\nFaraday’s representation by lines of force of the strains and stresses\r\nof a universal medium. So it is not surprising that he was led to a\r\nconsideration of the propagation of waves through this medium. The\r\nintroduction of the displacement current made the form of the\r\nelectrodynamic equations such as to yield a typical wave equation for\r\nspace free from electrical charges and currents. Moreover, the\r\ndisturbance was found to be transverse, and its velocity turned out to\r\nbe _identical with that of light_. The conclusion was irresistible. That\r\nlight could consist of anything but electromagnetic waves of extremely\r\nshort length was inconceivable. In fact so certain was Maxwell of this\r\ndeduction from theory that he felt it altogether unnecessary to resort\r\nto the test of experiment. For the electromagnetic theory explained so\r\nmany of the details which had been revealed by experiments in light,\r\nthat no doubt of its validity could be entertained. Even dispersion\r\nreceived ready elucidation on the assumption that the dispersing medium\r\nis made up of vibrators having a natural period comparable with that of\r\nthe light passing through it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James Clerk Maxwell]\r\n\r\nMaxwell’s book was published in 1873. Fifteen years later, Hertz,[156]\r\nat the instigation of Helmholtz, succeeded in detecting experimentally\r\nthe electromagnetic waves predicted by Maxwell’s theory. His oscillator\r\nconsisted of two sheets of metal in the same plane, to each of which was\r\nattached a short wire terminating in a knob. The knobs were placed\r\nwithin a short distance of each other, and connected to the terminals of\r\nan induction coil. By reflection standing waves were formed, and the\r\npositions of nodes and loops determined by a detector composed of a\r\nmovable loop of wire containing an air gap. Thus the wave length was\r\nmeasured. Hertz calculated the frequency of his radiator from its\r\ndimensions, and then computed the velocity of the disturbance. In spite\r\nof an error in his calculations, later pointed out by Poincaré, he\r\nobtained very nearly the velocity of light for waves traveling through\r\nair, but a velocity considerably smaller for those propagated along\r\nwires. Subsequent work by Lecher, Sarasin and de la Rive, and Trowbridge\r\nand Duane (=49=, 297, 1895; =50=, 104, 1895) cleared up this\r\ndiscrepancy, and showed the velocity to be in both cases identical with\r\nthat of light. The last-named investigators increased the size of the\r\noscillator until it was possible to measure the frequency by\r\nphotographing the spark in the secondary with a rotating mirror. The\r\npositions of nodes and loops were obtained by means of a bolometer after\r\nthe secondary had been tuned to resonance with the vibrator. The\r\nvelocity thus found for electromagnetic waves along wires is within\r\none-tenth of one percent of the accepted value of the velocity of light.\r\nHertz’s later experiments showed that waves in air suffer refraction and\r\ndiffraction, and he succeeded in polarizing the radiation by passing it\r\nthrough a grating constructed of parallel metallic wires.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy the law of action and reaction, it is found\r\nnecessary to attribute a quasi-momentum to electromagnetic waves. When a\r\ntrain of such waves is absorbed, their momentum is transferred to the\r\nabsorbing body, while if they are reflected an impulse twice as great is\r\nimparted. This consequence of theory, foreseen by Maxwell and developed\r\nin detail by Poynting, Abraham and Larmor, has been verified by the\r\nexperiments of Lebedew, and Nichols and Hull.[157] The latter used a\r\ndelicate torsion balance from which was suspended a couple of silvered\r\nglass vanes. In order to eliminate the effect of impulses imparted by\r\nthe molecules of the residual gas, such as Crookes had observed in his\r\nradiometer, readings were made at many different pressures and the\r\nballistic rather than the static deflection recorded. After the pressure\r\nproduced by light from a carbon arc had been measured, the intensity of\r\nthe radiation was determined with a bolometer. Preliminary experiments\r\nindicated the existence of a pressure of the order expected, and later\r\nmore careful measurements showed good quantitative agreement with\r\ntheory. This pressure had already found an important application in\r\nLebedew’s explanation of the solar repulsion of comet’s tails. These\r\ntails are made up of enormous swarms of very minute particles, and as\r\nthe comet swings around the sun they suffer a repulsion due to the\r\npressure of the intense solar radiation which counteracts the sun’s\r\ngravitational attraction. Hence the tail, instead of following after the\r\ncomet in its orbit, points in a direction away from the sun.\r\n\r\nSome uncertainty existed as to whether a convection current produces a\r\nmagnetic field. A compass needle is deflected by a current from a\r\nDaniell cell; is the same effect obtained when a conductor is charged\r\nelectrostatically and then whirled around the needle by means of an\r\ninsulating handle? The experimental difficulties involved in settling\r\nthis question are realized when the enormous difference between the\r\nelectrostatic and electromagnetic units of current is taken into\r\nconsideration. For a sphere one centimeter in radius, charged to a\r\npotential of 20,000 volts, and revolving in a circle sixty times a\r\nsecond, constitutes a current of little over a millionth of an ampere.\r\n\r\nThis problem was undertaken by Rowland (=15=, 30, 1878) in Helmholtz’s\r\nlaboratory at Berlin in 1876. A hard rubber disk coated on both sides\r\nwith gold was charged and rotated about a vertical axis at a rate of\r\nsixty revolutions a second. On reversing the sign of the electrification\r\non the disk, the astatic needle hung above its center showed a\r\ndeflection of over five millimeters. The current was calculated in\r\nelectrostatic units from the charge on the disk and its rate of motion,\r\nand in electromagnetic units from the magnetic deflection. The ratio of\r\nthese two quantities gave fair agreement with its theoretical value, the\r\nvelocity of light.\r\n\r\nAlthough the result of this experiment was confirmed by Rowland and\r\nHutchinson in 1889, Crémieu was convinced by an investigation carried\r\nout at Paris in 1900 that the Rowland effect did not exist. Consequently\r\nfurther repetition of the experiment was desirable. So the following\r\nyear Adams (=12=, 155, 1901) arranged two rings of eight spheres each so\r\nthat they could be rotated about their common axis from fifty to sixty\r\ntimes a second. One set of spheres was connected by brushes to the\r\npositive pole of a battery of 20,000 volts, the other to the negative\r\npole. The deflection of a nearby magnetometer needle was observed when\r\nthe electrification of the two rings was reversed, and from the reading\r\nso obtained the ratio of the electromagnetic to the electrostatic unit\r\nof current computed. This quantity was found to differ from the velocity\r\nof light by only a few percent. This experiment and the even more\r\nexhaustive investigations carried out by Pender, both independently and\r\nin collaboration with Crémieu, finally convinced the scientific world\r\nthat a convection current produces the same magnetic field as a\r\nconduction current of the same magnitude.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the ponderomotive force experienced in a magnetic field by\r\na conductor through which a current is passing, Maxwell had said, “It\r\nmust be carefully remembered, that the mechanical force which urges a\r\nconductor carrying a current across the lines of magnetic force, acts,\r\nnot on the electric current, but on the conductor which carries it.”\r\nHall (=19=, 200, 1880), one of Rowland’s students, questioned this\r\nstatement, and determined to put it to the test of experiment. Efforts\r\nto find an increase in the resistance of a wire placed at right angles\r\nto the lines of magnetic force were unsuccessful. So the current was\r\npassed through a moderately broad strip of gold leaf and the effect of\r\nthe magnetic field on the equipotential lines investigated. The results\r\nobtained confirmed Hall’s belief that the force exerted by the field\r\nacts on the current itself, and is transmitted through it to the\r\nconductor. Further investigation (=20=, 161, 1880) revealed the same\r\ndeflection of equipotential lines in thin strips of other metals,\r\nalthough the effect was found to be reversed in iron.\r\n\r\nDuring the closing years of the nineteenth century occurred three events\r\nof far reaching importance. The electron was isolated, and its charge\r\nand mass measured by J. J. Thomson in England; X-rays were discovered by\r\nRöntgen in Germany; and the first indications of radioactivity were\r\nfound by Becquerel in France. The first two are certainly to be\r\nattributed largely to the great advances which had been made in\r\nobtaining high vacua, and the last two might not have occurred so soon\r\nhad it not been for the photographic plate.\r\n\r\n_The Electron._—The atomic theory of electricity dates from the time of\r\nFaraday. His experiments on electrolysis showed that each monovalent\r\natom or radical, whatever its nature, carries the same charge, each\r\nbivalent ion a charge twice as great. Only a lack of knowledge of the\r\nnumber of atoms in a gram of the dissociated salt prevented him from\r\ncalculating the value of the elementary charge. As the discharge of\r\nelectricity through gases at low pressures became a subject for\r\nexperimental investigation, another line of approach to the study of the\r\natom of electricity was opened up. As early as the seventies Hittorf and\r\nGoldstein had observed that a shadow is cast by a screen placed in front\r\nof the cathode of a Crookes tube. Varley suggested that the cathode rays\r\nproducing the shadow consist of “attenuated particles of matter,\r\nprojected from the negative pole by electricity.” The discovery that\r\nthese rays are deflected by a magnetic field led English physicists to\r\nthe conclusion that they must be composed of charged particles, and the\r\ndirection of the deflection was such as to require the charge to be\r\nnegative. Hertz contested this view on the ground that his experiments\r\nshowed the rays to be unaffected by an electrostatic field, and\r\nsuggested that they consist of etherial disturbances. Finally Perrin\r\nsucceeded in passing the rays into a metal cylinder which received from\r\nthem a negative charge, and Lenard showed how excessively minute these\r\nnegatively charged particles must be by actually passing them through a\r\nthin sheet of aluminium in the wall of a vacuum tube, and detecting\r\ntheir presence in the air outside. Conclusive information as to the\r\nnature of the electron, as it was named by Johnstone Stoney, was\r\nsupplied by the classic experiments of J. J. Thomson.[158] First he\r\nshowed that Hertz’s failure to find a deflection when a stream of\r\nelectrons passes between the plates of a charged condenser was due to\r\nthe screening effect of the gaseous ions produced by the discharge. With\r\na much more highly evacuated tube he found no difficulty in obtaining a\r\ndeflection in an electrostatic field. By using crossed electric and\r\nmagnetic fields the deflection produced by one was just balanced by that\r\ncaused by the other, and from the field strengths employed both the\r\nvelocity of the particles and the ratio (_e_)/(_m_) of charge to mass\r\nwas calculated. The former was found to be about one-tenth the velocity\r\nof light, but the most startling result of the experiment was that the\r\nsame value of (_e_)/(_m_) was obtained no matter what residual gas was\r\ncontained in the tube or of what metal the cathode was made.\r\n\r\nTo calculate _e_ and then _m_ other methods are necessary. C. T. R.\r\nWilson has shown that in supersaturated air, water drops form easily on\r\ncharged molecules, and that negative ions are more effective in causing\r\ncondensation than positive ones. By making use of the results of this\r\nresearch Thomson has been able to measure the elementary charge. For\r\nsuppose a stream of negative ions to pass through supersaturated air. A\r\nlittle drop forms on each charged particle, and the cloud of condensed\r\nvapor settles to the bottom of the vessel. The charge carried and the\r\nmass of water deposited can be measured directly. Stokes’ law for the\r\nrate of fall of a minute particle through a gaseous medium enables the\r\naverage size of the drops to be computed from the observed rate of\r\ndescent of the cloud. Hence the number of drops formed and the charge\r\ncarried by each follows at once. H. A. Wilson improved the method by\r\nnoting the effect of an electric field upon the rate of fall of the\r\ncharged drops, and subsequent experiments undertaken by Millikan[159]\r\nhave been of such a character as to enable him to follow the motion of a\r\nsingle drop. Instead of water, the latter uses oil drops less than one\r\nten-thousandth of a centimeter in diameter. A drop, after one or more\r\nelectrons have attached themselves to it, is actually _weighed_ in terms\r\nof the charge on its surface by applying an upward electric force just\r\nsufficient to balance the force of gravity. Then its weight is\r\nindependently obtained from the density of the oil and the radius of the\r\ndrop as determined by the rate of fall when the electric field is\r\nabsent. Comparison of these two expressions gives 4·774(10)^{–10}\r\nelectrostatic units for the elementary charge. Combining this result\r\nwith the value of (_e_)/(_m_) found by Thomson, the mass of the electron\r\ncomes out to be about one eighteen-hundredth that of an atom of the\r\nlightest known element, hydrogen.\r\n\r\nThat the electron is a fundamental constituent of all matter is attested\r\nby the fact that charge and mass are the same regardless of the source\r\nor manner of production. Whether emitted by a heated metal, under the\r\naction of ultra-violet light, from a radioactive substance, by a body\r\nexposed to X-rays, as a result of friction, it is the same negatively\r\ncharged particle that constitutes the cathode ray of the discharge tube.\r\nMoreover, it makes its effect felt indirectly in many other phenomena,\r\nand from an investigation of some of these the ratio of charge to mass\r\ncan be determined independently. Of such perhaps the most interesting is\r\nthe Zeeman effect.\r\n\r\n_Spectroscopy._—Early in the nineteenth century Fraunhofer had observed\r\nthat the solar spectrum is crossed by a large number of dark lines.\r\nTheir presence was unexplained until in 1859 Kirchhoff and Bunsen showed\r\n“that a colored flame, the spectrum of which contains bright sharp\r\nlines, so weakens rays of the color of these lines when they pass\r\nthrough it, that dark lines appear in place of bright lines as soon as\r\nthere is placed behind the flame a light of sufficient intensity, in\r\nwhich the lines are otherwise absent.” For intra-atomic oscillators must\r\nhave the natural frequency of the radiation which they emit, and\r\nconsequently resonance will take place when they are exposed to rays of\r\nthis frequency coming from an outside source, and selective absorption\r\nensue. By comparing the bright lines in the spectra of metallic vapors\r\nmade luminous by a gas flame with the dark lines in the sun’s spectrum\r\nthese investigators showed that many of the common terrestrial elements\r\nexist in the sun. The interest in spectroscopy grew rapidly. The\r\nexcellent diffraction gratings made by Rutherfurd were succeeded by the\r\nsuperior concave gratings of Rowland. In 1877 Draper (=14=, 89, 1877)\r\nannounced the discovery of the bright lines of oxygen in the solar\r\nspectrum, but his interpretation of his photographs has not been\r\ncorroborated by the work of later investigators. Langley (=11=, 401,\r\n1901), by the aid of his newly invented bolometer, succeeded in\r\ndetecting the emission of energy from the sun in the infra-red in\r\namounts far exceeding that contained in the visible spectrum. In 1842\r\nDoppler drew attention to the fact that motion of the source should\r\ncause a displacement of the spectral lines, the shift being to the blue\r\nif the light is approaching and to the red if it is receding, and a few\r\nyears later Fizeau suggested the application of Doppler’s principle to\r\nthe measurement of the velocity of a star moving in the line of sight.\r\nThus the spectroscope has been able to supply one of the deficiencies of\r\nthe telescope, and the two together are sufficient to reveal all\r\ncomponents of stellar motion. When spectra formed by light from the\r\nsun’s limb and from its center are compared, the same effect reveals the\r\nrotation of the sun about its axis. (C. S. Hastings, =5=, 369, 1873; C.\r\nA. Young, =12=, 321, 1876.)\r\n\r\n_Further Evidence of the Electron._—In 1845 Faraday discovered a\r\nrotation of the plane of polarization when light passes in the direction\r\nof the lines of force through a piece of glass placed between the poles\r\nof an electromagnet. Examination of the spectrum from a glowing vapor\r\nsituated between the poles of a magnet, however, failed to reveal any\r\neffect of the field. The latter problem was attacked anew by Zeeman[160]\r\nin 1896, and with the aid of the improved appliances of modern science\r\nhe succeeded in detecting a broadening of the lines. Later experiments\r\nwith more powerful apparatus resolved these broadening lines into\r\nseveral components.\r\n\r\nLorentz[161] showed at once how the electron theory furnishes an\r\nexplanation of the Zeeman effect. He found that when the source is\r\nviewed at right angles to the lines of magnetic force, a spectral line\r\nshould be split into three components. Of these he predicted that the\r\nmiddle, or undisplaced component, would be found to be polarized at\r\nright angles to the direction of the field, and the other components\r\nparallel to the field. When the light proceeds from the source in a\r\ndirection parallel to the magnetic lines of force, two components only\r\nshould be formed, and these should be circularly polarized in opposite\r\nsenses. Moreover, from the separation of the components can be\r\ncalculated the ratio of charge to mass of the electronic vibrator which\r\nis responsible for the emission of radiant energy. Zeeman’s experiments\r\nconfirmed Lorentz’s theory in every detail, and yielded a value of\r\n(_e_)/(_m_) in substantial agreement with that obtained for cathode\r\nrays. Subsequent research, however, has shown that in many cases more\r\ncomponents are found than the elementary theory calls for. Hale has\r\ndetected the Zeeman effect in light from sun spots, proving that these\r\nblemishes on the sun’s face are vortices caused by whirling swarms of\r\nelectrified particles. Recently Stark and Lo Surdo have found a similar\r\nsplitting up of lines in the spectrum formed by light from canal rays\r\n(rays of positively charged particles) passing through an intense\r\nelectric field. This phenomenon has as yet received no adequate\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nOn discovering that an electric current is capable of producing a\r\nmagnetic field, Ampère had suggested that the magnetic properties of\r\nsuch substances as iron might be explained on the assumption of\r\nmolecular currents. The electron theory considers these currents to be\r\ndue to the revolution, inside the atom, of negatively charged particles\r\nabout an attracting nucleus. It occurred to Richardson that this motion\r\nshould give the atom the properties of a gyrostat. Hence if an iron bar\r\nbe rotated about its axis, the atoms should orient themselves so as to\r\nmake their axes more nearly parallel to the axis of rotation. Thus its\r\nrotation should cause the bar to become a magnet. Barnett[162] has\r\ntested this hypothesis, and has found the effect Richardson had\r\npredicted. From the strength of the magnetization produced, the value of\r\n(_e_)/(_m_) can be computed. Barnett finds a value somewhat smaller than\r\nthat for cathode rays, but of the right order of magnitude and sign.\r\nEinstein and De Haas have detected the inverse of this effect, i. e.,\r\nthe rotation of an iron rod when it is suddenly magnetized.\r\n\r\n_X-Rays._—In 1895, on developing a plate which had been lying near a\r\nvacuum tube, Röntgen[163] was surprised to find distinct markings on it.\r\nAs the plate had never been exposed to light, it was necessary to\r\nsuppose the effect to be due to some new and unknown type of radiation.\r\nFurther investigation showed that this radiation originates at the\r\npoints where cathode rays impinge on the glass walls of the tube.\r\nBesides being able to pass with ease through all but the most dense\r\nmaterial objects X-rays were found to have the power of ionizing gases\r\nthrough which they pass and ejecting electrons from metal surfaces\r\nagainst which they strike. The points at which these electrons are\r\nproduced are in turn the sources of secondary X-rays whose properties\r\nare characteristic of the metal from which they come.\r\n\r\nRöntgen’s discovery excited intense interest among laymen as well as in\r\nscientific circles. Of the many X-ray photographs taken, those of Wright\r\n(=1=, 235, 1896) of Yale were the first to be produced in this country.\r\nHis experiments were made immediately on receipt of the news of\r\nRöntgen’s research, and resulted in the publication of a number of\r\nphotographs showing the translucency for these rays of paper, wood, and\r\neven aluminium.\r\n\r\nAs X-rays are undeviated by electric or magnetic fields, Schuster, and\r\nlater Wiechert and Stokes, suggested that they might be electromagnetic\r\nwaves of the same nature as light, but much shorter and less regular.\r\nThe great objection to this hypothesis was the failure either to refract\r\nor diffract these rays. In fact Bragg contended that they were not\r\netherial disturbances at all, but consisted of neutral particles moving\r\nwith very high velocities. Finally Laue[164] demonstrated their\r\nundulatory nature by showing that diffraction took place under proper\r\nconditions. Just as the distance between adjacent lines of a grating\r\nmust be comparable to the wave length of light for a spectrum to be\r\nformed, a periodic structure with a grating space of their very much\r\nshorter wave length is necessary to diffract X-rays. Such a structure is\r\naltogether too fine to be made by human tools. Nature, however, has\r\nalready prepared it for man’s use. The distance between the atoms of a\r\ncrystal is just right to make it an excellent X-ray grating, and Laue\r\nhad no difficulty in obtaining diffraction patterns when Röntgen rays\r\nwere passed through a block of zincblende. The distance between adjacent\r\natoms of this cubic crystal can be computed at once from its density and\r\nmolecular weight, and then the wave length of the radiation calculated\r\nfrom the deviation suffered. In this way X-rays are found to have a\r\nlength less than one thousandth as great as visible light. Further study\r\nof this phenomenon, particularly by the two Braggs, father and son, has\r\nrevealed many of the structural details of more complicated crystals.\r\n\r\nThe most significant investigation in the field opened up by Laue’s\r\ndiscovery is that undertaken by Moseley[165] only a couple of years\r\nbefore he lost his life in the trenches at Gallipoli. Using many\r\ndifferent metals as anticathodes in a vacuum tube, he measured the\r\nfrequencies of the characteristic rays emitted. He found that if the\r\nelements are arranged in order of increasing atomic weight, the square\r\nroots of the characteristic frequencies form an arithmetical\r\nprogression. If to each element is assigned an integer, beginning with\r\none for hydrogen, two for helium, and so on, the square root of the\r\nfrequency of the characteristic radiation is found to be proportional to\r\nthis atomic number. Even though Uhler has shown recently that over wide\r\nranges Moseley’s law does not hold within the limits of experimental\r\nerror, there is undoubtedly much significance to be attached to this\r\nsimple relation.\r\n\r\n_Radioactivity._—The year following the discovery of X-rays, Becquerel\r\nfound that a photographic plate is similarly affected by radiations from\r\nuranium salts. Two years later the Curies separated from pitchblende the\r\nvery active elements polonium and radium. Passage of the rays from these\r\nsubstances through electric and magnetic fields revealed the existence\r\nof three types. The alpha rays have been shown by Rutherford and his\r\nco-workers to be positively charged helium atoms; the beta rays are very\r\nrapidly moving electrons; and the gamma rays are electromagnetic pulses\r\nof the same nature as X-rays but somewhat shorter. In 1902 Rutherford\r\nand Soddy advanced the theory of atomic disintegration, according to\r\nwhich the emission of a ray is an indication of the breaking down of the\r\natom to a simpler form. Thus in the radioactive substances there is\r\ngoing on before our eyes a continual transformation of one element into\r\nanother, a change, by the way, which appears to be in no slightest\r\ndegree either hastened or delayed by changes in temperature (H. L.\r\nBronson, =20=, 60, 1905) or external electrical condition of the\r\nradioactive element. Uranium is the progenitor of a long line of\r\ndescendants, of which radium was supposed for some time to be the first\r\nmember. Boltwood (=25=, 365, 1908) of Yale, however, showed that the\r\nslow growth of radium in uranium solutions is incompatible with this\r\nassumption, and soon isolated an intermediate product which he named\r\nionium. Radium itself disintegrates into a gas known as radium\r\nemanation, which in turn gives rise to a succession of other products.\r\nAnalyses by Boltwood (=23=, 77, 1907) of radioactive minerals from the\r\nsame locality show such a constant ratio between the amounts of uranium\r\nand lead present that it is natural to conclude that lead is the end\r\nproduct of the series. This hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that the\r\noldest rocks show relatively the greatest amounts of this element.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Ionium-Radium series two others have been discovered.\r\nOf these Boltwood’s (=25=, 269, 1908) investigations seem to indicate\r\nthat the one which starts with actinium is a collateral branch of the\r\nradium series and comes from the same parent uranium. The other begins\r\nwith thorium and comprises ten members. As yet the end products of the\r\nactinium and thorium series have not been identified, although there is\r\nsome reason for believing that an isotope of lead may be the final\r\nmember of the latter.\r\n\r\nAs the amount of a radioactive element which disintegrates in a given\r\ntime is proportional to the total mass present, an infinite time would\r\nbe required for the substance to be completely transformed. Hence the\r\nlife of such an element is measured by the half value period, or time\r\ntaken for half the initial mass to disintegrate. This time varies widely\r\nfor different radioactive substances, ranging from a small fraction of a\r\nsecond for actinium A to five billion years for uranium. Boltwood’s\r\n(=25=, 493, 1908) original determination of the life of radium from the\r\nrate of its growth in a solution containing ionium gave 2000 years as\r\nits result, although recent measurements by Miss Gleditsch (=41=, 112,\r\n1916) agree more closely with the value 1760 years obtained by\r\nRutherford and Geiger from the number of alpha particles emitted.\r\n\r\nUnder the action of X-rays or the radiations from radioactive\r\nsubstances, gases acquire a conductivity which has been attributed by\r\nThomson and Rutherford to the formation of ions. Zeleny has found that\r\nions of opposite sign have somewhat different mobilities in an electric\r\nfield, and experiments of Wellisch (=39=, 583, 1915) show that at low\r\npressures some of the negative ions are electrons. T. S. Taylor (=26=,\r\n169, 1908 _et seq._) and Duane (=26=, 464, 1908) have investigated the\r\nionization produced by alpha particles, and Bumstead (=32=, 403, 1911\r\n_et seq._) has studied the emission of electrons from metals which are\r\nbombarded by these rays. The investigations of Franck and Hertz, and\r\nMcLennan and Henderson, show a significant relation between the ionizing\r\npotential (energy which must be possessed by an electron in order to\r\nproduce an ion on colliding with an atom) and a quantity, to be\r\nconsidered later in more detail, which has been introduced by Planck\r\ninto the theory of radiation.\r\n\r\n_Methods of Science._—Scientific progress seems to follow a more or less\r\nclearly defined path. Experimentation brings to light the hidden\r\nprocesses of nature, and hypotheses are advanced to correlate the facts\r\ndiscovered. As more and more phenomena are found to fit into the same\r\nscheme, the hypotheses at first proposed tentatively, although often\r\nonly after extensive alterations, become firmly established as theories.\r\nFinally there may appear a fundamental clash between two theories, each\r\nof which in its respective domain seems to represent the only possible\r\nmanner in which a large group of phenomena can be correlated. The maze\r\nbecomes more perplexing at every step. At last a genius appears on the\r\nscene, approaches the problem from a new and unsuspected point of view,\r\nand the paradox vanishes. Such changes in point of view are the\r\nmilestones which mark the progress of science. That science is stagnant\r\nwhose only function is to collect, classify and correlate vast stores of\r\nexperimental data. The sign of vitality is the existence of clearly\r\ndefined and fundamental problems any possible solution of which seems\r\nirreconcilable with the most basic truths of the science in question.\r\nThe greater the paradox grows, the more certain the advent of a new\r\npoint of view which will bring one step nearer the comprehensive picture\r\nof nature which is the goal of natural philosophy.\r\n\r\n_The Ether._—From the earliest times philosophers have been attracted by\r\nthe possibility of explaining physical phenomena in terms of an\r\nall-pervading medium. So strong had this tendency become by the middle\r\nof the nineteenth century that the English school of physicists were\r\nattributing rigidity, density and nearly all the properties of material\r\nmedia to the ether. In fact most physicists seemed to have forgotten\r\nthat no experiment had ever given _direct_ evidence of the existence of\r\nsuch a medium. Not until the first decade of the twentieth century was\r\nit realized that the experimental evidence actually pointed in quite the\r\nopposite direction, and that a new point of view was needed in dealing\r\nwith those phenomena of light and electromagnetism which had been\r\npreviously described in terms of a universal medium. Some account of the\r\ndevelopment of the ether theory and of the origin and growth of the\r\npoint of view which has its principal exemplification in the principle\r\nof relativity is essential for an understanding of present tendencies in\r\nformulating a philosophic basis for scientific thought.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Newton and for a century after there was much controversy\r\nbetween the adherents of two irreconcilable theories of light. Hooke had\r\nsuggested that light is a wave motion traveling through a homogeneous\r\nmedium which fills all space, and Huygens had shown that the law of\r\nrefraction can be deduced at once from this hypothesis if it is assumed\r\nthat the velocity of light in a transparent body is less than that in\r\nfree ether. However, Newton, impressed by the fact that a ray obtained\r\nby double refraction in Iceland spar differs from a ray of ordinary\r\nlight just as a rod of rectangular cross section differs from one of\r\ncircular cross section, and seeing no way of explaining this dissymmetry\r\nin terms of a wave motion analogous to longitudinal sound waves, adhered\r\nto the view that light consists of infinitesimal particles shot out from\r\nthe luminous body with enormous velocities. So great was his reputation\r\non account of his discoveries in other fields that this theory of light\r\nheld sway among his contemporaries and successors until the labors of\r\nYoung and Fresnel at the beginning of the nineteenth century definitely\r\nestablished the undulatory theory. However, in spite of the fact that a\r\ncorpuscular theory of light made the assumption of an ether unnecessary\r\nin so far as the simpler of the observed phenomena are concerned, even\r\nNewton postulated the existence of such a medium, partly in order to\r\nexplain the more complicated results of experiments in light, and partly\r\nin order to provide a vehicle for the propagation of gravitational\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nNow an ether, if it is to explain anything at all, must have at least\r\nsome of the simpler properties of material media. The most fundamental\r\nof these, perhaps, is position in space. As a first approximation in\r\nexplaining optical phenomena on the earth’s surface, the earth might be\r\nsupposed to be at rest relative to the ether. But the establishment of\r\nthe Copernican system made the sun the center of the solar system and\r\ngave the earth an orbital speed of eighteen miles a second. It may be\r\nremarked parenthetically that the speed of a point on the equator due to\r\nthe earth’s diurnal rotation is quite insignificant compared to its\r\norbital velocity. Hence as a second approximation the sun might be\r\nconsidered at rest relative to the ether and the earth as moving through\r\nthis unresisting medium.\r\n\r\nThe first indication of this motion lay in the discovery of aberration\r\nby the British astronomer Bradley in 1728. Bradley noticed that stars\r\nnear the pole of the ecliptic describe small circles during the course\r\nof a year, while those in the plane of the ecliptic vibrate back and\r\nforth in straight lines, stars in intermediate positions describing\r\nellipses. The surprising thing, however, was that the time taken to\r\ncomplete one of these small orbits is in all cases exactly a year.\r\nBradley concluded that the phenomenon is in some way dependent on the\r\nearth’s motion around the sun, and he was not long in reaching the\r\ncorrect explanation. For suppose the earth to be at rest. Then in\r\nobserving a star at the pole of the ecliptic it would be necessary to\r\nkeep the axis of the telescope exactly at right angles to the plane of\r\nthe earth’s orbit. However, as the earth is in motion, the telescope\r\nmust be pointed a little forward, just as in walking rapidly through the\r\nrain an umbrella must be inclined forward so as to intercept the\r\nraindrops which would otherwise fall on the spot to be occupied at the\r\nend of the next step. The angle through which the telescope has to be\r\ntilted is known as the angle of aberration, and the tangent of this\r\nangle may easily be shown to be equal to the ratio of the velocity of\r\nthe earth to the velocity of light. Knowing the velocity of the earth,\r\nthe velocity of light can then be calculated. This method was one of the\r\nfirst of obtaining the value of this important quantity.\r\n\r\nMore recently, terrestrial methods of great precision have been devised\r\nfor measuring the velocity of light. The most accurate of these is that\r\nemployed by the French physicist Foucault in 1862. A ray of light is\r\nreflected by a rotating mirror to a fixed mirror placed at some\r\ndistance, which in turn reflects the ray back to the moving mirror. The\r\nlatter, however, has turned through a small angle during the time\r\nelapsed since the first reflection, and consequently the direction of\r\nthe ray on returning to the source is not quite opposite to that in\r\nwhich it had started out. This deviation in direction is determined from\r\nthe displacement of the image formed by the returning light, and from it\r\nthe velocity of light is calculated. In order to make the deflection\r\nappreciable the distance between the two mirrors should be very great.\r\nAs originally arranged by Foucault, it was found impractical to make\r\nthis distance greater than twenty meters, and consequently the\r\ndisplacement of the image was less than a millimeter. Such a small\r\ndeflection limited the accuracy of the experiment to one percent. In\r\n1879, however, Michelson (=18=, 390, 1879), then a master in the United\r\nStates Navy, improved Foucault’s optical arrangements to such an extent\r\nthat he was able to use a distance of nearly seven hundred meters\r\nbetween the two mirrors. With a rate of two hundred and fifty-seven\r\nrevolutions a second for the rotating mirror, the displacement obtained\r\nwas over thirteen centimeters. This experiment gave 299,910 kilometers a\r\nsecond for the velocity of light, with a probable error of one part in\r\nten thousand. Later investigations by Newcomb and Michelson (=31=, 62,\r\n1886) gave substantially the same result. So great has been the accuracy\r\nof these terrestrial determinations that recent practice has been to\r\ncalculate from them and the angle of aberration the earth’s orbital\r\nvelocity, and hence the distance of the earth from the sun. This\r\nindirect method of measuring the astronomical unit has a probable error\r\nno greater than the best parallax methods of the astronomer. (J.\r\nLovering, =36=, 161, 1863.)\r\n\r\nAberration is a first order effect, i. e., it depends upon the first\r\npower of the ratio of the velocity of the earth to the velocity of\r\nlight, and at first sight it seemed to prove conclusively that the earth\r\nmust be in motion relative to the luminiferous medium. Other questions\r\nhad to be settled, however, and one of these was whether or not light\r\ncoming from a star would be refracted differently when passing through\r\noptical instruments from light which had a terrestial origin. Arago\r\nsubjected the matter to experiment, and concluded that in every respect\r\nthe light from a star behaved as if the earth were at rest and the star\r\nactually occupied the position which it appears to occupy on account of\r\naberration. Finally optical experiments with terrestrial sources seemed\r\nto be in no way affected by the motion of the earth through the ether.\r\n\r\nIn order to account for these facts Fresnel advanced the following\r\ntheory. To explain the refraction that takes place when light enters a\r\ntransparent body, it is necessary to assume that light waves travel more\r\nslowly through matter than in free ether. Now the velocity of sound is\r\nknown to vary inversely with the square root of the density of the\r\nmaterial medium through which it passes. Hence it is natural to assume\r\nthat ether is condensed inside material objects to such an extent that\r\nthis same relation connects its density with the velocity of light\r\ntraveling through it. But when a lens or prism is set in motion, Fresnel\r\nsupposed it to carry along only the _excess_ ether which it contains,\r\nether of the normal density remaining behind. This assumption suffices\r\nto explain Arago’s results, and yet fits in with the phenomenon of\r\naberration. It gives for light traveling in the direction of motion\r\nthrough a moving material medium of index of refraction _n_ an absolute\r\nvelocity greater than that when the medium is at rest by an amount\r\n\r\n                          (1 − (1/_n^2_))_v_,\r\n\r\nwhich is only a fraction of the velocity _v_ which would have to be\r\nadded if convected matter carried along all the ether which resides\r\nwithin it. This expression was tested directly, first by Fizeau in 1851,\r\nand later by Michelson and Morley (=31=, 377, 1886) in this country. The\r\nexperiment consists in bifurcating a beam of light, passing one-half in\r\none direction and the other in the opposite direction through a stream\r\nof running water. On reuniting the two rays the usual interference\r\nfringes are produced. Reversing the direction of motion of the water\r\ncauses the fringes to shift, and from the amount of this shift the\r\nvelocity imparted to the light by the motion of the stream is computed.\r\nThe divergence between the experimental value of this quantity and that\r\ncalculated from Fresnel’s coefficient of entrainment was found by\r\nMichelson and Morley to be less than one percent, which was about their\r\nexperimental error. Thus Fresnel’s expression for the velocity of light\r\nin a moving medium is entirely confirmed by experiment. The derivation\r\nof it accepted to-day, however, is very different from his original\r\ndeduction.\r\n\r\nIt has been noted that the phenomena of polarization led Newton to\r\nreject the wave theory of light. The only type of wave known to him was\r\nthe longitudinal wave, in which the vibrations of the particles of the\r\nmedium are in the same direction as that of propagation of the wave, and\r\nit was impossible to suppose that such a wave could have different\r\nproperties in different directions at right angles to the line in which\r\nit is advancing. But in 1817 Young suggested that this inconsistency\r\nbetween the wave theory and the facts of polarization could be removed\r\nby supposing the vibrations constituting light to be executed at right\r\nangles to the direction of propagation. Thus in ordinary light the\r\nvibrations are to be conceived as taking place haphazard in all\r\ndirections in the plane perpendicular to the ray, while in plane\r\npolarized light these vibrations are confined to a single direction.\r\nThis supposition explained so many of the puzzling results of\r\nexperiment, that it was accepted at once and led to the complete\r\nvindication of the undulatory theory.\r\n\r\n_Elastic Solid Theory._—Shortly afterwards Poisson succeeded in solving\r\nthe differential equation which determines the motion of a wave through\r\nan elastic medium. His solution shows that such a medium is capable of\r\ntransmitting two types of wave—one longitudinal, the other transverse.\r\nIf κ denotes the volume elasticity, η the rigidity and ρ the density of\r\nthe medium, the velocities of the two waves are respectively\r\n\r\n                      √((κ + (⁴⁄₃)η)/ρ) and √(η/ρ)\r\n\r\nNow a solid has both compressibility and rigidity, and transmits in\r\ngeneral both types of wave. A fluid, on the other hand, on account of\r\nits lack of rigidity, cannot support a transverse vibration. Hence it\r\nwas natural that Green, in searching for a dynamical explanation of the\r\nether, should have proposed in a paper read before the Cambridge\r\nPhilosophical Society in 1837 that the ether has the elastic properties\r\nof a solid. One great difficulty presented itself; disturbances inside\r\nan elastic solid must give rise to compressional as well as to\r\ntransverse waves. But no such thing as a compressional wave had been\r\nfound in the experimental study of light. Green attempted to overcome\r\nthis difficulty by attributing an infinite volume elasticity to the\r\nether. The expression above shows that longitudinal waves originating in\r\nsuch an incompressible medium would be carried away with an infinite\r\nvelocity, and it may be shown that the energy associated with them would\r\nbe infinitesimal in amount. The next step was to calculate the\r\ncoefficients of transmission and reflection for light passing from one\r\nmaterial medium to another. Here the elastic solid theory is not\r\naltogether successful. If the ether is supposed to have different\r\ndensities in the two media, as in Fresnel’s theory, but the same\r\nrigidity, certain of these coefficients fail to give the values demanded\r\nby experiment, while if the densities are assumed the same but the\r\nrigidities different, other of the coefficients have discordant values.\r\nIn connection with the phenomena of double refraction even more serious\r\ndifficulties are encountered.\r\n\r\n_Electromagnetic Theory._—It was beginning to be felt that an ether must\r\nexplain more than the phenomena of light, for Faraday’s conception of\r\nelectromagnetic action as carried on through the agency of a medium had\r\nadded greatly to its functions. Finally Maxwell’s demonstration that\r\nelectromagnetic waves are propagated with the velocity of light made the\r\ntheory of light into a subdivision of electrodynamics. Maxwell himself\r\ndid not apply electromagnetic theory to the explanation of reflection\r\nand refraction. This deficiency, however, was remedied by Lorentz in\r\n1875. The results obtained, as well as those for double refraction (J.\r\nW. Gibbs, =23=, 262, 1882 _et seq._), and metallic reflection (L. P.\r\nWheeler, =32=, 85, 1911), provided a complete vindication of the\r\nelectromagnetic theory of light. This is all the more significant when\r\nthe extreme precision obtainable in optical experiments is taken into\r\naccount. For instance, Hastings (=35=, 60, 1888) has tested Huygens’\r\nconstruction for double refraction in Iceland spar and found that “the\r\ndifference between a measured index of refraction ... at an angle of 30°\r\nwith the crystalline axis, and the index calculated from Huygens’ law\r\nand the measured principal indices of refraction” is a matter of only\r\n4–5 units in the sixth decimal place. Since Maxwell’s time the gamut of\r\nelectromagnetic waves has been steadily extended. The shortest Hertzian\r\nwaves merge almost imperceptibly into the longest heat waves of the\r\ninfra-red, and from there the known spectrum runs continuously through\r\nthe visible region to the short waves of the extreme ultra-violet\r\nrecently disclosed by Lyman. Here there is a short gap until soft X-rays\r\nare reached, and finally the domain of radiation comes to an end with\r\ngamma rays a billionth of a centimeter in length.\r\n\r\nMaxwell’s ether was not a dynamical ether in the sense of Green’s\r\nelastic solid medium. In spite of the fact that Maxwell was always\r\nactive in devising mechanical analogues to illustrate the phenomena of\r\nelectromagnetism, he was never enthusiastic over the speculations of the\r\nadvocates of a dynamical ether. The electrodynamic equations provided an\r\naccurate representation of the electric and magnetic fields, and beyond\r\nthat he felt it was needless to go. That Gibbs (=23=, 475, 1882) held\r\nthe same view is made evident by the closing paragraphs of a paper in\r\nwhich he shows that the electromagnetic theory of light accounts in\r\nminutest detail for the intricate phenomena accompanying the passage of\r\nlight through circularly polarizing media. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The laws of the propagation of light in plane waves, which have thus\r\n  been derived from the single hypothesis that the disturbance by which\r\n  light is transmitted consists of solenoidal electrical fluxes, ... are\r\n  essentially those which are received as embodying the results of\r\n  experiment. In no particular, so far as the writer is aware, do they\r\n  conflict with the results of experiment, or require the aid of\r\n  auxiliary and forced hypotheses to bring them into harmony therewith.\r\n\r\n  In this respect the electromagnetic theory of light stands in marked\r\n  contrast with that theory in which the properties of an elastic solid\r\n  are attributed to the ether,—a contrast which was very distinct in\r\n  Maxwell’s derivation of Fresnel’s laws from electrical principles, but\r\n  becomes more striking as we follow the subject farther into its\r\n  details, and take account of the want of absolute homogeneity in the\r\n  medium, so as to embrace the phenomena of the dispersion of colors and\r\n  circular and elliptical polarization.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Further Dynamical Theories._—Kelvin, however, was not satisfied with\r\nthis type of ether. To him dynamics was the foundation of all physical\r\nphenomena, and nothing could be said to be explained until a mechanical\r\nmodel was provided. So he returned to the elastic solid theory, and\r\ndeveloped the consequences of the assumption, already made use of by\r\nCauchy, that the ether has a negative volume elasticity of such a value\r\nas to make the velocity of the compressional wave zero. In order to\r\nprevent such an ether from collapsing it is necessary to assume that it\r\nis rigidly attached at its boundaries and that cavities cannot be formed\r\nat any point in its interior. Now Gibbs (=37=, 129, 1889) has pointed\r\nout the remarkable fact that the equations describing the motion of\r\nKelvin’s quasi-labile ether are of exactly the same form as the\r\nelectromagnetic equations. Electric displacement is represented by an\r\nactual displacement of the ether, magnetic intensity by a rotation.\r\nHence everything which can be explained by the electrodynamic equations\r\nfinds an analogue in terms of Kelvin’s ether. Still another type of\r\ndynamic ether which fits the known facts was proposed by McCullagh and\r\nperfected by Larmor. In this ether a rotational elasticity is premised,\r\nsuch as would exist if each particle of the medium consisted of three\r\nrigidly connected gyrostats with mutually perpendicular axes. In this\r\nether electrical displacements correspond to rotations, and magnetic\r\nstrains to etherial displacement.\r\n\r\n_A New Point of View._—While the dynamical school was still dominant in\r\nEngland, another point of view was developing on the continent.\r\nKirchhoff denied that it was the province of science to provide\r\nmechanical explanations of the ether and electrodynamic phenomena such\r\nas Kelvin conceived to be necessary in order to make these phenomena\r\nintelligible. Kirchhoff’s contention was that the object of science is\r\npurely descriptive,—phenomena must be observed, classified, and mutual\r\nconnections described by the fewest number of differential equations\r\npossible. Mach expressed the same idea somewhat more concisely when he\r\nasserted that the aim of science is “economy of thought.” For instance,\r\nin the time of Newton, planetary motions could be described quite\r\nsatisfactorily by means of the three laws of Kepler. The motion of\r\nfalling bodies on the earth’s surface had been described with a fair\r\ndegree of accuracy by Galileo. The value of Newton’s law of gravitation,\r\nhowever, lay in the fact that this great generalization made it possible\r\nto describe these and many other types of motion by a single simple\r\nformula, instead of leaving each to be governed by a number of separate\r\nand apparently unrelated laws. The importance of such a generalization\r\nis measured by the economy of thought which it introduces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.      FIG. 2.      FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n_Electron Theory._—The electron theory was leading to a reversal of\r\nKelvin’s idea that dynamical principles must underlie electrodynamics.\r\nLorentz had shown that a rigorous solution of the electrodynamic\r\nequations did away entirely with Maxwell’s displacement current, but\r\nmade the electromagnetic field at a point in space depend not upon the\r\ndistribution of charges and currents at the _same_ instant, but at a\r\ntime earlier sufficient to allow the effect to travel with the velocity\r\nof light from the charges and currents producing the field to the point\r\nat which the electric and magnetic intensities are to be found. The\r\nposition of a charge or current element at this earlier time he denoted\r\nits “effective position.” The effective distribution, then, is that\r\nactually _seen_ by an observer stationed at the point under\r\nconsideration at the instant for which the intensity of the\r\nelectromagnetic field is to be determined. This solution of the\r\nelectrodynamic equations led in turn to rigorous expressions for the\r\nelectric and magnetic intensities produced by a very small charged\r\nparticle, such as an electron. Fig. 1 shows the electrostatic field\r\nproduced by a charged particle at rest. The lines of force spread out\r\nradially and uniformly in all directions. In fig. 2 the electron is\r\nsupposed to have a velocity _v_ horizontally to the right of an amount\r\nsmaller than, though comparable with, the velocity of light _c_. It is\r\nseen that the lines of electric force still diverge radially from the\r\ncharge, but are crowded in the equatorial plane and spread apart in the\r\npolar regions. The dissymmetry grows as the velocity increases until if\r\nthe velocity of light should be reached the field would be entirely\r\nconcentrated in a plane at right angles to the direction of motion. Now\r\nit may be shown that fig. 2 is obtainable from fig. 1 by _reducing\r\ndimensions in the direction of motion in the ratio of_\r\n\r\n                   √(1 − β^2) : 1, where β ≡ _v_/_c_.\r\n\r\nFor a uniformly convected electric field differs from an electrostatic\r\nfield only in that the dimensions in the direction of motion are\r\ncontracted in this particular ratio. Fig. 3 represents the electric\r\nfield of a charged particle which has a uniform acceleration to the\r\nright. Consider Faraday’s analogy between lines of force and stretched\r\nelastic bands. The symmetry of the first two figures shows that in\r\nneither of these cases would there be a resultant force on the charged\r\nparticle. But in the third figure it is obvious that a force to the left\r\nis exerted on the charge by its own field. Calculation shows this force\r\nto be proportional in magnitude to the acceleration. Let it be\r\npostulated that the resultant force on a charged particle is always\r\nzero. Then if _F_ is the applied force, the force on the particle due to\r\nthe reaction of its field will be — _m f_, where _f_ stands for the\r\nacceleration and _m_ is a positive constant, and we have the fundamental\r\nequation of dynamics\r\n\r\n                           _F_ − _m_ _f_ = 0\r\n\r\nHence, instead of admitting Kelvin’s contention that all physical\r\nphenomena must be given a mechanical explanation, it would seem more\r\nlogical to assert that electrodynamics actually underlies mechanics.\r\n\r\nCalculation shows the electromagnetic mass _m_ to vary inversely with\r\nthe radius of the charged particle. Now Thomson’s experiments made it\r\npossible to calculate the mass of an electron. Hence its radius can be\r\ncomputed, and is found to be about 2(10)^{–13} part of a centimeter, or\r\none fifty-thousandth part of the radius of the atom. Since numbers so\r\nsmall convey little meaning, consider the following illustration, due,\r\nin part, to Kelvin. Imagine a single drop of water to be magnified until\r\nit is as large as the earth. The individual atoms would then have the\r\nsize of baseballs. Now magnify one of these atoms until it is comparable\r\nin size with St. Peter’s cathedral at Rome. The electrons within the\r\natom would appear as a few grains of sand scattered about the nave. This\r\nseparation between the constituent electrons of the atom,—so great in\r\ncomparison with their dimensions,—explains how alpha particles can be\r\nshot by the billion through thin-walled glass tubing without leaving any\r\nholes behind or impairing in the slightest degree the high vacuum within\r\nthe tube. The much smaller high speed beta particles pass through an\r\naverage of ten thousand atoms without even coming near enough to one of\r\nthe component electrons to detach it and form an ion.\r\n\r\n_Michelson-Morley Experiment._—In 1881 Michelson (=22=, 120, 1881)\r\nconceived an ingenious and bold method of measuring the orbital motion\r\nof the earth through the luminiferous ether. As the experiment was one\r\ninvolving considerable expense, Bell, the inventor of the telephone\r\nreceiver, was appealed to successfully for the funds necessary to carry\r\nit through. Michelson’s experimental plan was as follows: A beam of\r\nlight traveling in the direction of the earth’s motion strikes an\r\nunsilvered mirror _m_ at an angle of 45°. Part of the light passes\r\nthrough, the rest being reflected at right angles to its original\r\ndirection. Each ray is returned by a mirror at a distance _l_ from _m_.\r\nOn meeting again, the ray whose path has been at right angles to the\r\ndirection of the earth’s motion passes on through the mirror, while the\r\nother ray is reflected so as to bring the two in line and form\r\ninterference fringes. Now consider the effect of the earth’s motion on\r\nthe paths of the two rays. In fig. 4 the earth is supposed to be moving\r\nto the right. The unsilvered mirror _m_ bifurcates a beam of light\r\ncoming from a source _a_. By the time the ray reflected from _m_ has\r\ntraveled to the mirror _b_ and back, _m_ will have moved forward to\r\n_m’_; a distance 2β_l_, where the small quantity β is the ratio of the\r\nearth’s velocity to the velocity of light. Hence the length of the path\r\ntraversed by this ray is approximately\r\n\r\n                            2_l_(1 + ½β^2).\r\n\r\nThe other ray will reach the mirror _c_ after the latter has moved\r\nforward a distance\r\n\r\n                             β_l_/(1 − β^2)\r\n\r\nand on returning find _m_ at _m’_. Hence its path has a length of\r\nroughly 2_l_(1 + β^2). The difference in path of the two rays is β^2_l_\r\nand consequently they should be a little out of phase on meeting at _d_.\r\nBy rotating the apparatus clockwise through 90° the directions of the\r\ntwo rays relative to the earth’s motion are interchanged, and the\r\ninterference fringes would be expected to shift an amount corresponding\r\nto a difference in path of 2β^2_l_. This quantity is of course\r\nsmall,—β^2 is about one one hundred millionth,—but so sensitive are the\r\nmethods of interferometry that Michelson felt confident that he would be\r\nable to detect the earth’s motion through the ether. The apparatus\r\nconsisted of a table which could be rotated about a vertical axis in\r\nmuch the same way as a spectrometer table, and provided with arms a\r\nmeter long to carry the mirrors _b_ and _c_. With this length of arm the\r\ninterference fringes from sodium light should shift by an amount\r\ncorresponding to four hundredths of a wave length when the table is\r\nrotated through a right angle. When the experiment was first performed\r\nthe apparatus was placed on a stone pier in the Physical Institute at\r\nBerlin. So sensitive was the instrument to outside vibrations that even\r\nafter midnight it was found impossible to get consistent readings.\r\nFinally a satisfactory foundation was constructed in the cellar of the\r\nAstrophysical observatory at Potsdam. But what was the astonishment of\r\nthe experimenters to find that the expected shift of the interference\r\nfringes did not exist!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe extreme delicacy of the experiment made it desirable to confirm the\r\nresult by repeating it. This was done by Michelson and Morley (=34=,\r\n333, 1887) in 1887. In place of a revolving table a massive slab of\r\nstone floating on mercury was used to carry the apparatus. This slab was\r\nkept in constant rotation, the observer following it around. Moreover,\r\nthe precision of the experiment was greatly increased by reflecting each\r\nray back and forth across the slab a number of times between leaving and\r\nreturning to the mirror _m_. The accuracy attained was such as to\r\njustify Michelson in declaring that if the effect sought actually\r\nexisted it could not be so great as one-twentieth of its calculated\r\nvalue. In 1905 Morley and Miller[166] repeated the experiment for the\r\nsecond time and succeeded in increasing the sensitiveness of the\r\napparatus to a point such that a motion through the ether of one-tenth\r\nof the earth’s orbital velocity could have been detected.\r\n\r\nThe displacement looked for in the Michelson-Morley experiment is known\r\nas a second-order effect in that it depends upon the square of the ratio\r\nof the velocity of the earth to that of light. Michelson at first\r\nconsidered that the negative result obtained confirmed a theory proposed\r\nby Stokes in which it was assumed that the ether inside and near its\r\nsurface partakes of the motion of the earth, while that at a distance is\r\npractically quiescent. But there are many objections to Stokes’ theory,\r\none of which was brought out by an experiment of Michelson’s (=3=, 475,\r\n1897) in which he attempted by an interference method to detect a\r\ndifference in the velocity of light at different levels above the\r\nearth’s surface. The negative result obtained led him to conclude that\r\nif Stokes’ theory were true the earth’s influence on the ether would\r\nhave to extend to a distance above its surface comparable with its\r\ndiameter. Meanwhile a more satisfactory explanation was forthcoming. It\r\nhas been pointed out that a uniformly convected electric field is\r\nderivable from an electrostatic field by contracting dimensions in the\r\ndirection of motion in the ratio\r\n\r\n                            √(1 − β^2) : 1.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald and Lorentz showed independently that if moving matter is\r\ndistorted in this same way the result obtained by Michelson would be\r\njust that to be expected. For then the distance of the mirror _c_ from\r\n_m_ would be\r\n\r\n                              l√(1 − β^2)\r\n\r\ninstead of _l_, and the path of the ray moving parallel to the earth’s\r\norbit\r\n\r\n                            2_l_(1 + ½β^2),\r\n\r\nwhich is just that of the other ray. Of course when the apparatus is\r\nrotated through 90°, the distance of this mirror from _m_ assumes its\r\nnormal value again, and the distance of the other mirror becomes\r\nshortened. As all measurement consists in comparing the object to be\r\nmeasured with a standard this contraction could never be detected by\r\nexperimental methods, for the measuring rod would contract in exactly\r\nthe same ratio as the body to be measured.\r\n\r\nIn computing its electromagnetic mass Abraham had assumed the electron\r\nto be a uniformly charged rigid sphere which keeps its spherical form no\r\nmatter how great a velocity it may be given. He found that the mass\r\nincreases with the speed at very high velocities, becoming infinite as\r\nthe velocity of light is approached, and that its value depends upon the\r\ndirection of the applied force. After the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction\r\nwas seen to be necessary in order to explain Michelson’s result, Lorentz\r\ncalculated the electromagnetic mass of a charged sphere which is\r\ndeformed into an oblate spheroid when set in motion. For this type of\r\nelectron too, the mass approaches infinity for velocities as great as\r\nthat of light, and is different for different directions. If a force is\r\napplied in the direction of motion the inertia to be overcome is a\r\nlittle greater than when the force is applied at right angles to this\r\ndirection. Thus we have to distinguish between longitudinal and\r\ntransverse masses. But the masses of Lorentz’s electron are not the same\r\nfunctions of its velocity as those of Abraham’s. Kaufmann and after him\r\nBucherer tested experimentally the relation between transverse mass and\r\nvelocity by observing the deflections produced by electric and magnetic\r\nfields in the paths of high speed beta particles. The latter’s work was\r\nsuch an ample confirmation of Lorentz’s formula that it may be\r\nconsidered as proven that a moving electron at least suffers contraction\r\nin the direction of motion in the ratio\r\n\r\n                            √(1 − β^2) : 1.\r\n\r\nThe electromagnetic theory of light had proved so successful when\r\napplied to bodies at rest that Lorentz was anxious to extend this theory\r\nto the optics of moving media. His problem was to find a group of\r\nhomogeneous linear transformations that would leave the form of the\r\nelectrodynamic equations unchanged. The Michelson-Morley experiment had\r\nshown that dimensions in the direction of motion must be contracted in\r\nthe moving system, those at right angles remaining unaltered. But\r\nLorentz soon found that it was also necessary to use a new unit of time\r\nin the moving system, and as this time was found to depend upon the\r\n_position_ of the point at which it is to be determined, he called it\r\nthe _local_ time. Lorentz’s transformation is just that of the principle\r\nof relativity, but he did not succeed in expressing the electrodynamic\r\nequations in terms of the new coördinates and time in exactly the same\r\nform as for a system at rest, for the reason that he failed to endow\r\nthese new units with sufficient reality to justify him in using them\r\nwhen it came to transforming the velocity term involved in an electric\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\n_Principle of Relativity._—In 1905 appeared in the Annalen der\r\nPhysik[167] a paper destined to alter entirely the point of view from\r\nwhich problems in light and electromagnetic theory are to be approached.\r\nThe author was Albert Einstein, of Berne, Switzerland, a young man of\r\ntwenty-six who had already made a number of notable contributions to\r\ntheoretical physics.\r\n\r\nThe principle of relativity proposed by Einstein was by no means new to\r\nstudents of dynamics. Newton’s first two laws of motion express very\r\nclearly the fact that in mechanics all motion is relative. Force is\r\nproportional to acceleration, and the relation between the two is the\r\nsame whether the motion under consideration is referred to fixed axes or\r\nto axes moving with a constant velocity. But in connection with the\r\nphenomena of light and electromagnetism the case seemed to be quite\r\ndifferent. There everything was referred to a fixed ether, and even\r\nthough Lorentz had found a set of transformations which left the\r\nelectrodymanic equations practically unchanged, he continued to think in\r\nterms of an ether. So physicists were not a little startled when\r\nEinstein postulated that no experiment, practical or ideal, could ever\r\ndistinguish between two systems in such a manner as to warrant the\r\nassertion that one of them is at rest and the other in motion. All\r\nmotion is relative, and the laws governing physical, chemical and\r\nbiological phenomena are the same in terms of the units of one system as\r\nin terms of those of any other.\r\n\r\nEinstein next considers some very fundamental questions. What do we mean\r\nwhen we say that two events, one at A and the other at a point B far\r\nfrom A, occur at the same time? Obviously the expression has no\r\nsignificance unless synchronous clocks are stationed at the two points.\r\nBut how is it to be determined whether or not these two clocks are\r\nsynchronous? If instantaneous communication could be established between\r\nA and B the matter would be simple enough. Since no infinite velocity of\r\ntransmission is available, however, let a light wave be sent from A to B\r\nand returned to A immediately upon its arrival. If the time indicated by\r\nthe clock at B when the signal is received is half way between that at\r\nwhich it left A and the time at which it arrives on its return, then the\r\ntwo clocks may be considered synchronous. Now if it desired to measure\r\nthe length of a bar which is moving parallel to the scale with which the\r\nmeasurement is to be made, it is necessary to note the positions of the\r\ntwo ends of the bar at the _same_ instant. So even the measurement of\r\nthe length of a moving body depends upon the condition of synchronism at\r\ndifferent points in space.\r\n\r\nThe principle of relativity requires that the velocity of light shall be\r\nthe same in one system as in another relative to which the first is in\r\nmotion. Hence the definition of synchronism makes it possible to obtain\r\na set of transformations connecting space and time measurement on one\r\nsystem with those on another. This group of transformations is exactly\r\nthat which Lorentz had found would transform the electrodynamic\r\nequations into themselves. But Einstein’s point of view brought out a\r\nremarkable reciprocity which Lorentz had missed. If two parallel rods MN\r\nand OP are in motion relative to each other in the direction of their\r\nlengths, not only does OP appear shortened to an observer at rest with\r\nrespect to MN, but MN appears shorter than normal in the same ratio to\r\nan observer who is moving along with the rod OP.\r\n\r\nEinstein’s theory makes the velocity of light the maximum speed with\r\nwhich a signal can be transmitted. This leads to his celebrated addition\r\ntheorem. Consider three observers A, B and C. Let B be moving relative\r\nto A with a velocity of nine-tenths the velocity of light, and C in the\r\nsame direction with an equal velocity relative to B. In terms of\r\nold-fashioned notions of time and space, the velocity of C relative to A\r\nwould be computed as one and eight-tenths the velocity of light. But the\r\nrelativity theory gives it as ninety-nine hundredths the velocity of\r\nlight. For the velocity of light can never be surpassed by that of any\r\nmaterial object. This deduction from theory is most strikingly confirmed\r\nby the fact that although beta particles have been observed with\r\nvelocities as high as ninety-nine hundredths that of light, the velocity\r\nof light is never quite equalled. It may be remarked in passing that the\r\nprinciple of relativity requires that the masses of all material bodies\r\nshall vary with the velocity in the same manner as Lorentz found to be\r\nthe case for the electromagnetic mass of the deformable electron. In\r\nthis connection Bumstead (=26=, 498, 1908) has devised an elegant method\r\nof deducing the ratio of longitudinal to transverse mass.\r\n\r\nThe close connection between electrodynamics and the principle of\r\nrelativity is obvious from the fact that both lead to the same time and\r\nspace transformations. Furthermore L. Page (=37=, 169, 1914) has shown\r\nthat the electrodynamic equations can be derived exactly and in their\r\nentirety from nothing more than the kinematics of relativity and the\r\nassumption that every element of charge is a center of uniformly\r\ndiverging lines of force. Hence it may safely be asserted that no purely\r\nelectromagnetic phenomenon can ever come into contradiction with this\r\nprinciple. The simplicity thus introduced into the solution of a certain\r\nclass of problems is enormous. As an example consider the question as to\r\nwhether a moving star is retarded by the reaction of its own radiation.\r\nThis purely electrodynamical problem is of such complexity that attempts\r\nto solve it have led to some controversy among mathematical physicists.\r\nThe principle of relativity tells us without recourse to analysis that\r\nno retardation can exist.\r\n\r\nThroughout the nineteenth century the ether has played a fundamental\r\npart in all important physical theories of light and electromagnetism.\r\nBut if it is not possible for experiment to detect even the state of\r\nmotion of the ether, why postulate the existence of such a medium? If it\r\ndoes not possess the most fundamental characteristic of matter, how can\r\nit possess such derived properties as density and elasticity,—properties\r\nwhich any conceivable _mechanical_ medium must have in order to transmit\r\ntransverse vibrations? The relativist does not deny the existence of an\r\nether. To him the question has no more meaning than if he were asked to\r\nexpress an opinion as to the reality of parallels of latitude on the\r\nearth’s surface. As a convenient medium of expression in describing\r\ncertain phenomena the ether has justified much of the use which has been\r\nmade of it. But to attribute to it a degree of substantiality for which\r\nthere is no warrant in experiment, is to change it from an aid into an\r\nobstacle to the progress of science. From the relativist point of view\r\nthe distinction is very sharp between those motions of charged particles\r\nwhich are experimentally observable, and such geometrical conventions as\r\nelectromagnetic fields, or analytical symbols as electric and magnetic\r\nintensities. These modes of representation have been and still are of\r\nthe greatest use and importance, but their value in scientific\r\ndescription must not lead to lack of appreciation of their purely\r\nspeculative character.\r\n\r\nFinally attention must be drawn to the fact that the discoveries of\r\ninductive science, embodied in the great generalization we have just\r\nbeen discussing, have led to a more intimate knowledge of the nature of\r\ntime and space than twenty centuries of introspection on the part of\r\nprofessional philosophers. Minskowski, whose promise of greater\r\nachievement was cut off by an untimely death, has shown that four\r\ndimensional geometry makes possible the representation with beautiful\r\nsimplicity of the time and space relationships of this theory. The one\r\ntime and three space dimensions merge in such a manner as to form a\r\nsingle whole with not a vestige of differentiation between these\r\nfundamental quantities. Wilson and Lewis[168] have made this\r\nrepresentation familiar to American readers through their admirable\r\ntranslation of Minskowski’s work into the notation of Gibbs’s vector\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\nAberration, the Doppler effect, anomalous dispersion, —indeed all known\r\nphenomena,—are found to be in accord with the principle of relativity.\r\nIt must be borne in mind, however, that this principle applies only to\r\nsystems moving relative to one another in straight lines with constant\r\nvelocities. That there is something absolute about rotation has been\r\nrecognized since Foucault performed his famous pendulum experiment in\r\n1851. This experiment (C. S. Lyman, =12=, 251 and 398, 1851) consisted\r\nin setting a pendulum composed of a heavy-brass ball suspended by a long\r\nwire into oscillation in such a way as to avoid appreciable ellipticity\r\nin its motion. Observation of the rate at which the ground rotates\r\nrelative to the plane of vibration of the pendulum furnished a method of\r\nmeasuring the rotation of the earth about its axis _without reference to\r\ncelestial bodies_. The gyroscopic compass in use to-day provides yet\r\nanother terrestrial method of detecting this rotation.\r\n\r\n_The Future of Physics._—At times during the history of physics it has\r\nseemed as if the fundamental laws of this science had been so completely\r\nformulated that nothing remained to future generations beyond the\r\nroutine of deducing to the full the consequences of these laws, and\r\nincreasing the precision of the methods used to measure the constants\r\nappearing in them. That Laplace held this view has already been pointed\r\nout, and Maxwell, in his introductory lecture at the opening of the\r\nCavendish laboratory in 1871, said, “This characteristic of modern\r\nexperiments—that they consist principally of measurements—is so\r\nprominent, that the opinion seems to have gotten abroad that in a few\r\nyears all the great physical constants will have been approximately\r\nestimated, and that the only occupation which will then be left to men\r\nof science will be to carry on these measurements to another place of\r\ndecimals.” That he himself did not entertain this view is made evident\r\nby a succeeding paragraph. “But we have no right to think thus of the\r\nunsearchable riches of creation, or of the untried fertility of those\r\nfresh minds into which these riches will continue to be poured. It may\r\npossibly be true that, in some of those fields of discovery which lie\r\nopen to such rough observations as can be made without artificial\r\nmethods, the great explorers of former times have appropriated most of\r\nwhat is valuable, and that the gleanings which remain are sought after\r\nrather for their abstruseness than for their intrinsic worth. But the\r\nhistory of science shows that even during that phase of her progress in\r\nwhich she devotes herself to improving the accuracy of the numerical\r\nmeasurement of quantities with which she has long been familiar, she is\r\npreparing the materials for the subjugation of new regions, which would\r\nhave remained unknown if she had been contented with the rough methods\r\nof her early pioneers....”\r\n\r\nThat Maxwell’s forecast of the prospects of his science was no\r\noverestimate will be granted by those who have followed the progress of\r\nphysics during the last twenty years. Yet the work accomplished in the\r\npast appears small compared to that which is left to the future. Many of\r\nthe unsolved problems are matters of fitting together puzzling details,\r\nbut there is at least one whose solution appears to demand a radical\r\nmodification in our fundamental physical conceptions. This is the\r\nformulation of the laws which govern the motions of electrons and\r\npositively charged particles inside the atom.\r\n\r\n_Black Radiation._—The significance of the problem was first brought to\r\nlight through the study of black radiation. By a black body is meant one\r\nwhose distinguishing characteristic is that it emits and absorbs\r\nradiation of all frequencies, and black radiation is that which will\r\nexist in thermal equilibrium with such a body. The interest of this type\r\nof radiation lies in the fact, demonstrated by Kirchhoff, that its\r\nnature depends only upon the temperature of the black body with which it\r\nis in equilibrium, and on none of this body’s physical or chemical\r\ncharacteristics. Thus we may speak of the “temperature” of the radiation\r\nitself, meaning by this the temperature of the material body with which\r\nit would be in equilibrium.\r\n\r\nThe problem of black radiation is to find the distribution of energy\r\namong the waves of different frequencies at any given temperature. The\r\nfirst step toward a solution was made when Stefan showed experimentally,\r\nand Boltzmann as a deduction from thermodynamics and electrodynamics,\r\nthat the total energy density summed up over all wave lengths varies\r\nwith the fourth power of the absolute temperature. If the energy density\r\nis plotted as ordinate against the wave length as abscissa, the\r\nexperimental curve for any one temperature rises from the axis of\r\nabscissas at the origin, reaches a maximum, and falls to zero again as\r\nthe wave length becomes infinitely great. Now Wien’s displacement law,\r\nthe second important step toward the determination of the form of this\r\ncurve, shows that as the temperature is raised the wave length to which\r\nits highest point corresponds becomes shorter,—in fact this particular\r\nwave length varies inversely with the absolute temperature. This\r\ntheoretical conclusion is entirely confirmed by experiment. (J. W.\r\nDraper, =4=, 388, 1847.)\r\n\r\nFarther than this general thermodynamical principles are unable to go.\r\nStatistical mechanics, however, asserts that when a large number of like\r\nelements are in thermal equilibrium, the average kinetic energy\r\nassociated with each degree of freedom is equal to a universal constant\r\nmultiplied by the absolute temperature. This “principle of\r\nequi-partition of energy” has been applied in various ways to obtain a\r\nradiation law. The most straightforward method is based on the\r\nequilibrium which must ensue between radiation field and material\r\noscillators when the latter emit, on the average, as much energy as they\r\nabsorb. From whatever aspect the problem is treated, however, the\r\nradiation law obtained from the application of the equi-partition\r\nprinciple is the same. And while this law agrees well with the\r\nexperimental curve for long wave lengths, it shows an energy density\r\nthat becomes indefinitely great for extremely short waves, which is not\r\nonly at variance with the facts, but actually leads to an _infinite_\r\nvalue of this quantity when integrated over the entire spectrum.\r\n\r\n_The Energy Quantum._—Now the principle of equi-partition of energy\r\nrests securely on most general dynamical principles. That these\r\ndynamical laws are inexact to any such extent as the divergence between\r\ntheory and experiment would indicate, is inconceivable; that they are\r\n_insufficient_ when applied to motions of electrons in such intense\r\nfields as occur within the atom seems no longer open to doubt. In order\r\nto obtain a radiation formula in accord with experiment Planck has found\r\nit necessary to extend the atomic idea to energy, which he conceives to\r\nexist in multiples of a fundamental quantum _h_ν, ν being the frequency\r\nand _h_ Planck’s constant. That some such hypothesis of discontinuity is\r\nessential in order to obtain any law that will even approximately fit\r\nthe experimental facts has been proved by Poincaré. But the precise spot\r\nat which the quantum is introduced differs for every new derivation of\r\nPlanck’s law. As deduced most recently by Planck himself, the quantum\r\nshows itself in connection with the emission of energy by the material\r\noscillators with which the radiation field is in equilibrium. These\r\noscillators are supposed to act quite normally in every respect except\r\nemission; here the radiation demanded by the electrodynamic equations is\r\ncast aside, and an oscillator is supposed to emit at once all its energy\r\nafter it has accumulated an amount equal to some integral multiple of\r\n_h_ν. A form of the theory which does not contain this improbable\r\ncontradiction of the firmly established facts of electrodynamics\r\nintroduces the quantum into the specification of the energy of vibration\r\nwhich is permitted to each oscillator. Here both emission and absorption\r\nfollow the classical theory, but the motion of an emitting and absorbing\r\nlinear oscillator of frequency ν is supposed to be stable only for those\r\namplitudes for which the energy of its oscillations is an integral\r\nmultiple of _h_ν. In order to maintain the energy at these particular\r\nvalues, the oscillator may draw energy from, or deposit surplus energy\r\nwith, other degrees of freedom which partake neither in emission nor\r\nabsorption, but act merely as storehouses.\r\n\r\n_Photoelectric Effect._—When investigating the production of\r\nelectromagnetic waves, Hertz had noticed that a spark passed more\r\nreadily between the terminals of his oscillator when the negative\r\nelectrode was illuminated by light from another spark. Further\r\ninvestigation by Hallwachs, Elster and Geitel, and others showed that\r\nthis effect was due to the emission of electrons by a metal exposed to\r\nthe influence of ultra-violet light. Lenard discovered that the energy\r\nwith which a negatively charged particle is ejected is entirely\r\nindependent of the intensity of the light, and further investigation\r\nshowed it to depend only on the frequency. Einstein suggested that the\r\nelectrons appearing in this so-called photo-electric effect start from\r\nwithin the metal with an initial energy _h_ν. In passing through the\r\nsurface a resistance is encountered, however, so he concluded that the\r\nenergy with which the fastest moving electrons appear outside the metal\r\nshould be equal to _h_ν less the work done in overcoming this\r\nresistance. Recent experiments not only confirm this relation, but\r\nprovide a most satisfactory method of determining the value of _h_.\r\nMillikan[169] finds it to be 6·57(10)^{–27} ergs sec., which gives the\r\nquantum for yellow light a value sixty times as great as the heat energy\r\nof a monatomic gas molecule at O°C. That this large amount of energy can\r\nbe transferred from the incident light to the ejected electron is quite\r\nout of the question; it must come from within the atom. In this way some\r\nindication is obtained of how vast intra-atomic energies must be.\r\n\r\n_Structure of the Atom._—The generally accepted model of the atom is\r\nthat due chiefly to Rutherford.[170] He considers it to be constituted\r\nof electrons revolving about a positive nucleus either singly or grouped\r\nin concentric rings, in much the same manner as the planets revolve\r\naround the sun. Experiments on the scattering of alpha rays, however,\r\nshow that the nucleus, while it must have a positive charge sufficient\r\nto neutralize the charges of all the electrons moving around it, cannot\r\nhave a volume of an order of magnitude greater than that of the\r\nelectron. The number of unit charges residing on it, except in the case\r\nof hydrogen, which is supposed to consist of a singly charged nucleus\r\nand only one electron, is found to be approximately half the atomic\r\nweight. Thus helium, with an atomic weight of about four, has a doubly\r\ncharged nucleus with two electrons revolving about it, and lithium a\r\ntriply charged nucleus and three electrons. The number of unit charges\r\non the nucleus is supposed to correspond with the atomic number used by\r\nMoseley in interpreting the results of his experiment on the X-ray\r\nspectra of the elements.\r\n\r\nNow the electron which is revolving around the positive nucleus of a\r\nhydrogen atom, must, according to electrodynamic laws, radiate energy.\r\nThis radiation will act as a resistance to its motion, causing its orbit\r\nto become smaller and its frequency to increase. Hence luminous hydrogen\r\nwould be expected to give off a continuous spectrum. The very fine lines\r\nactually found seem inexplicable on the classical dynamical and\r\nelectrodynamical theories. These lines, and those of many other spectra,\r\nmay even be grouped into series, and the relations between them\r\nexpressed in mathematical form. Formulæ have been proposed by Balmer,\r\nRydberg, Ritz and others, all of which contain a universal constant _N_\r\nas well as certain parameters which must be varied by unity in passing\r\nfrom one line of a series to the next.\r\n\r\nIn 1913 Bohr[171] proposed anatomic theory which brings to light a\r\nremarkable numerical relationship between this quantity _N_ and Planck’s\r\nconstant _h_. He postulated that the electron in the hydrogen atom, for\r\ninstance, cannot revolve in a circle of any arbitrary radius, but is\r\nconfined to those orbits for which its kinetic energy is an integral\r\nmultiple of ½_hn_, _n_ being its orbital frequency. Now at times this\r\nelectron is supposed to jump from an outer to an inner orbit, when the\r\nexcess energy of the first orbit over the second is radiated away. But\r\nthe energy emitted is also taken to be equal to _h_ν, where ν is the\r\nfrequency of the radiation. Hence ν can be determined, and the\r\nexpression obtained for it is exactly that given long before by Balmer\r\nas an empirical law. The most remarkable thing about it, however, is\r\nthat Bohr’s result contains a constant involving _h_ and the electronic\r\ncharge and mass which has precisely the value of the universal constant\r\n_N_ of Balmer’s and Rydberg’s formulæ. In all, the theory accounts for\r\nthree series of hydrogen, and yields satisfactory results for helium\r\natoms which have lost an electron, or lithium atoms which have a double\r\npositive charge. But for atoms which retain more than a single electron\r\nit seems no longer to hold.\r\n\r\nThe three mentioned are only the most clearly defined of a growing group\r\nof phenomena in which the quantum manifests itself. Its significance and\r\nthe alteration in our fundamental conceptions to which it seems to be\r\nleading is for the future to make clear. That it presents the most\r\nimportant and interesting problem as yet unsolved few physicists would\r\ndeny.\r\n\r\n_American Physicists._—In attempting to cover the progress of physics\r\nduring the last hundred years in the space of a few pages, many\r\nimportant developments of the subject have of necessity remained\r\nuntouched, and the treatment of many others has been entirely\r\ninadequate. Among those appearing in the Journal of which no mention has\r\nbeen made are LeConte’s (=25=, 62, 1858) discovery of the sensitive\r\nflame and Rood’s (=46=, 173, 1893) invention of the flicker photometer.\r\nHowever, enough has been recounted to indicate the preeminent position\r\nin the history of physics in America occupied by four men: Joseph Henry,\r\nof the Albany Academy, Princeton, and the Smithsonian Institution; Henry\r\nAugustus Rowland, of Johns Hopkins University; Josiah Willard Gibbs, of\r\nYale; and Albert Abraham Michelson, of the United States Naval Academy,\r\nCase School of Applied Science, Clark University, and the University of\r\nChicago. Of these, the last named has the distinction of being the only\r\nAmerican physicist to have received the Nobel prize, though there is\r\nlittle doubt that the other three would have been similarly honored had\r\nnot their important work been published prior to the institution of this\r\naward. All four occupy high places in the ranks of the world’s great men\r\nof science, and the investigations carried out by them and their fellow\r\nworkers in America have given to their country a position in the annals\r\nof physics which is by no means insignificant.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _The Journal’s Part in Meteorology._\r\n\r\nThe meteorological investigations published in the early numbers of the\r\nJournal have played an important role in establishing a correct theory\r\nof storms. Before the origin of the United States Signal Service in 1871\r\nno systematic weather reports were issued by any governmental agency in\r\nthis country, and consequently the work of collecting as well as\r\ninterpreting meteorological data rested entirely in the hands of\r\ninterested individuals and institutions. The earliest important studies\r\nof storms to appear in the Journal were contributed by Redfield of New\r\nYork, whose first paper (=20=, 17, 1831) treated in considerable detail\r\na violent storm which passed over Long Island, Connecticut and\r\nMassachusetts in 1821. He concluded that “the direction of the wind at a\r\nparticular place, forms no part of the essential character of a storm,\r\nbut is only incidental to that particular portion ... of the track of\r\nthe storm which may chance to become the point of observation, ... the\r\ndirection of the wind being, in all cases, compounded of both the\r\nrotative and progressive velocities of the storm.” A few years later,\r\nanalyses of twelve “gales and hurricanes of the Western Atlantic” (=31=,\r\n115, 1837) led to the statement that the phenomena involved “are to be\r\nascribed mainly to the mechanical gravitation of the atmosphere, as\r\nconnected with the rotative and orbital movements of the earth’s\r\nsurface.” In this paper is emphasized the fact that the wind may blow in\r\ndiametrically opposite directions at points near the storm center.\r\n“While one vessel has been lying-to in a heavy gale of wind, another,\r\nnot more than thirty leagues distant, has at the very same time been in\r\nanother gale equally heavy, and lying-to with the wind in quite an\r\nopposite direction.” From an accompanying sketch showing wind\r\ndirections, the reader would infer that, at this time, Redfield believed\r\nthe motion of the air to be very nearly in circles about the storm\r\ncenter. The same idea is conveyed by a later paper (=42=, 112, 1842).\r\nEspy (=39=, 120, 1840) of Philadelphia, however, claimed that\r\nobservation showed rather that the wind blew inwards toward a central\r\npoint, if the storm were round in shape, or toward a central line, if it\r\nwere oblong. This view Redfield (=42=, 112, 1842) contested, and brought\r\nforth much evidence to prove its falsity. A later statement (=1=, 1,\r\n1846) of his own theory is as follows: “I have never been able to\r\nconceive, that the wind in violent storms moves only in _circles_. On\r\nthe contrary, a vortical movement ... appears to be an essential element\r\nof their violent and long-continued action, of their increased energy\r\ntowards the center or axis, and of the accompanying rain.... The\r\n_degree_ of vorticular inclination in violent storms must be subject,\r\nlocally, to great variations; but it is not probable that, on an average\r\nof the different sides, it ever comes near to forty-five degrees from\r\nthe tangent of a circle,—and that such average inclination ever exceeds\r\ntwo points of the compass, may well be doubted.” A qualitative\r\nexplanation of the effect of the earth’s rotation on the direction of\r\nthe wind near the storm center had already been given by Tracy (=45=,\r\n65, 1843), and this was followed some years later by Ferrel’s (=31=, 27,\r\n1861) very thorough quantitative investigation of the dynamics of the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nA number of individuals kept systematic records of meteorological\r\nobservations, among whom was Loomis, whose storm analyses did much to\r\nsettle the merits of the rival theories of Redfield and Espy. In\r\nstudying the storm of 1836 (=40=, 34, 1841) he had drawn on the map\r\nlines through those points in the track of the storm where the\r\nbarometer, at any given hour, is lowest. While this method revealed the\r\ngeneral direction in which the storm was progressing, it failed to give\r\nmuch indication of its size or shape. In discussing the two tornadoes of\r\nFebruary, 1842, one of which had already been described in the Journal\r\n(=43=, 278, 1842), he adopted a new and more illuminating graphical\r\nmethod. Instead of connecting points of lowest pressure, he drew a curve\r\nthrough all points where the barometer stood at its normal level, then\r\none through those points at which the pressure was ²⁄₁₀ of an inch below\r\nnormal, and so on. Temperature he treated in much the same way, and the\r\nstrength and direction of the wind were indicated by arrows. This\r\ninnovation gave to his storm analyses a significance which had been\r\nentirely lacking in those of his predecessors, and led to the familiar\r\nsystems of isobars and isotherms in use on the daily charts issued by\r\nthe Weather Bureau at the present time. Loomis advocated careful\r\nobservations for one year at stations 50 miles apart all over the United\r\nStates, so that sufficient data might be obtained to settle once for all\r\nthe law of storms. His efforts, seconded by those of Henry, Bache,\r\nPierce, Abbe, and Lapham, led eventually to the establishment of the\r\nSignal Service, and the publication of daily weather maps according to\r\nthe plan advocated thirty years before. These maps afforded a basis for\r\nfurther analyses of storms, which he published in numerous\r\n“Contributions to Meteorology” (=8=, 1, 1874, _et seq._) between 1874\r\nand his death in 1890.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his work on storms, Loomis made a careful study of the\r\nearth’s magnetism (=34=, 290, 1838 _et seq._), and of the aurora\r\nborealis (=28=, 385, 1859 _et seq._). That a connection existed between\r\nsunspots, aurora, and terrestrial magnetism was already recognized.\r\nLoomis (=50=, 153, 1870 _et seq._), however, showed that the periodicity\r\nof the aurora borealis, as well as of excessive disturbances in the\r\nearth’s magnetic field, corresponds very closely with that of sunspots.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _Notes._\r\n\r\nFootnote 154:\r\n\r\n  J.

COE\r\n\r\n\r\n This article is intended as a brief survey of the development of\r\nzoology in America, and no attempt is made to give a general history of\r\nthe science. There are numerous accounts in several languages of\r\nzoological history in general, among them being W. A. Locy’s “Biology\r\nand its Makers.” Brief outlines of the history of zoology may be found\r\nin many zoological and biological text-books.\r\n\r\nFor the history of American zoology the reader is referred to Packard’s\r\nreport on “A Century’s Progress in American Zoology,” published in the\r\nAmerican Naturalist, (10, 591, 1876), to Packard’s “History of Zoology,”\r\npublished in volume 1 of the Standard Natural History (pp. lxii to\r\nlxxii, 1885); to G. B. Goode’s “Beginnings of Natural History in\r\nAmerica,”[172] and “Beginnings of American Science,”[173] and to H. S.\r\nPratt’s Manual of the Common Invertebrate Animals (pp. 1–9), 1916. In\r\nBinney’s “Terrestrial Air-breathing Mollusks of the United States”\r\n(1851) is a chapter on the rise of scientific zoology in the United\r\nStates which well describes the zoological conditions in the early part\r\nof the century, while numerous monographs and papers give the history of\r\nthe investigations on the various groups of animals or on special fields\r\nof study.\r\n\r\nBrief biographical sketches of the most distinguished of our older\r\nNaturalists—Wilson, Audubon, Agassiz, Wyman, Gray, Dana, Baird, Marsh,\r\nCope, Goode and Brooks are given in “Leading American Men of Science,”\r\nedited by David Starr Jordan, 1910. More extensive biographies have been\r\npublished separately, and the activities of a number of the more\r\nprominent American zoologists have been recorded in the Biographical\r\nMemoirs of the National Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe developmental history of zoology in America falls naturally into\r\nfour fairly well marked periods, namely:—1, _Period of descriptive\r\nnatural history_, previous to 1847, embracing the early studies on the\r\nclassification and habits of animals, characteristic of the zoological\r\nwork previous to the arrival of Louis Agassiz in America. 2, _Period of\r\nmorphology and embryology_, 1847–1870, during which the influence of\r\nAgassiz directed the zoological studies toward problems concerning the\r\nrelationships of animals as indicated by their structure and\r\ndevelopmental history. 3, _Period of evolution_, 1870–1890, when the\r\nprinciple of natural selection received general recognition and the\r\nzoological studies were largely devoted to the applications of the\r\ntheory to all groups of animals. 4, _Period of experimental biology_,\r\nsince 1890, during which time have occurred the remarkable advances in\r\nour knowledge of the nature of organisms through the application of\r\nexperimental methods in the various branches of the modern science of\r\nbiology.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _American Zoology in 1818._\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the century which this volume commemorates, the\r\naccumulated biological knowledge of the world consisted mainly of what\r\nis to-day called descriptive natural history. The zoological treatises\r\nof the time were devoted to the names, distinguishing characters and\r\nhabits of the species of animals and plants known to the naturalists of\r\nEurope either as native species or as the results of explorations in\r\nother parts of the world. This required little more than a superficial\r\nknowledge of their general anatomical structures.\r\n\r\nThe naturalists of those days had no conception of the life within the\r\ncell which we now know to form the basis of all the activities of\r\nanimals and plants, nor had they even the necessary means of studying\r\nsuch life. The compound microscope, so necessary for the study of even\r\nthe largest of the cells of the body, was not adapted to such use until\r\n1835, although the instrument was invented in the seventeenth century.\r\nWith the perfection of the microscope came a period of enthusiastic\r\nstudy of microscopic organisms and microscopic structures of higher\r\nanimals and plants. It was not until twenty years after the founding of\r\nthe Journal that the cell theory of structure and function in all\r\norganisms was established by the discoveries of Schleiden and Schwann.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the nineteenth century saw great zoological activity in\r\nEurope, and particularly in France. Buffon’s great work on the Natural\r\nHistory of Animals had recently been completed, Cuvier had only one year\r\nbefore published his classic work in comparative anatomy, “Le Regne\r\nAnimal,” and Lamarck’s “Philosophie Zoologique” had then aroused a new\r\ninterest in classification and comparative anatomy from an evolutionary\r\nstandpoint. E. Geoffroy St.-Hilaire was at the same time supporting an\r\nevolutionary theory based on embryonic influences resulting in sudden\r\nmodifications of adult structure. These epoch-making discoveries and\r\ntheories gained a considerable following in France, Germany and England,\r\nbut seem to have had little influence on the zoological work of the\r\nfollowing half century in America.\r\n\r\nThe science of zoology as understood to-day is commonly said to have\r\nbeen founded by Linnæus by the publication of the modern system of\r\nclassification in the tenth edition of his “Systema Naturæ” in 1758. The\r\ninfluence of Linnæus aroused an interest in biological studies\r\nthroughout Europe and stimulated new investigations in all groups of\r\norganisms. Such studies as related to animals naturally followed first\r\nthe classification and relationship of species, that is, systematic\r\nzoology, and then led gradually into the development of the different\r\nbranches of the subject, as morphology, comparative anatomy, physiology,\r\nand embryology, which eventually were recognized as almost independent\r\nsciences.\r\n\r\nOf these sciences systematic zoology, which has come to mean the\r\nclassification, structure, relationship, distribution and habits, or\r\nnatural history, is the pioneer in any region. Thus we find in our new\r\ncountry at the time of the founding of the Journal in 1818, only sixty\r\nyears after the publication of Linnæus’ great work, the beginning of\r\nAmerican zoology taking the form of the collection and description of\r\nour native animals.\r\n\r\nIt is true that many of our more conspicuous and easily collected\r\nanimals were described long before the opening of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, but this is to be credited mainly to the work of European\r\nnaturalists who had made expeditions to this country for the purpose of\r\nstudying and collecting. These collections were then taken to Europe and\r\nthe results published there. We thus find in the 12th edition of Linnæus\r\ndescriptions of over 500 American species, about half of which were\r\nbirds. As an illustration of the extent to which some of these works\r\ncovered the field even in those early days may be mentioned a monograph\r\nin two quarto volumes with many beautifully colored plates on the\r\n“Natural History of the rarer Lepidopterous Insects of Georgia.” This\r\nwas published in London in 1797 by J. E. Smith from the notes and\r\ndrawings of John Abbot, one of the keenest naturalists of any period.\r\n\r\nDuring the early years of the nineteenth century, however, economic\r\nconditions in our country became such as to give opportunity for\r\nscientific thought. Educated men then formed themselves into societies\r\nfor the discussion of scientific matters. This naturally led to the\r\nestablishment of publications whereby the papers presented to the\r\nsocieties could be published and made available to the advancement of\r\nscience generally. The most influential of these was the Journal of the\r\nPhiladelphia Academy of Natural Science, which was established in 1817,\r\nand was devoted largely to zoological papers. The Annals of the New York\r\nLyceum of Natural History date from 1823, and the Journal of the Boston\r\nSociety of Natural History from 1834. The Transactions of the American\r\nPhilosophical Society in Philadelphia and the Memoirs of the American\r\nAcademy of Arts and Sciences in Boston also published many zoological\r\narticles.\r\n\r\nIn these publications and in the Journal, which was founded in 1818,\r\nappear the descriptions of newly discovered animal species, with\r\nobservations on their habits.\r\n\r\nThe number of investigators in this field in the first quarter of the\r\nnineteenth century was but few, and most of these were compelled to take\r\nfor the work such time as they could spare from their various\r\noccupations.\r\n\r\nGradually the workers became more numerous until about the middle of the\r\ncentury zoology was taught in all the larger colleges. The science\r\nthereby developed into a profession.\r\n\r\nFor some years the studies remained largely of a systematic nature, and\r\nembraced all groups of animals, but long before the close of the century\r\nthe attention of the majority of the ever increasing group of zoologists\r\nwas directed into more promising channels for research and there came\r\nthe development of the sciences of comparative anatomy, physiology,\r\nembryology, experimental zoology, cytology, genetics, and the like,\r\nwhile the systematists became specialists in the various animal groups.\r\n\r\nBut the work in systematic zoology remains incomplete and many native\r\nspecies are still undescribed or imperfectly classified. It is perhaps\r\nfortunate that a few faithful systematists remain at their tasks and\r\ntend to keep the experimentalists from the disaster which might\r\notherwise result from the confusion of the species under investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n       _Period of Descriptive Natural History.—Previous to 1847._\r\n\r\nOf the few American naturalists whose writings were published toward the\r\nend of the eighteenth century and at the beginning of the nineteenth the\r\nnames of William Bartram (1739–1823), Benjamin Barton (1766–1815),\r\nSamuel Mitchill (1764–1831), William Peck (1763–1822), and Thomas\r\nJefferson (1743–1826), require special mention. Bartram’s entertaining\r\nvolume describing his travels through the Carolinas, Georgia and\r\nFlorida, published in 1793, contains a most interesting account of the\r\nbirds and other animals which he found.\r\n\r\nBarton wrote many charming essays on the natural history of animals, but\r\nwas more particularly interested in botany. Mitchill’s most important\r\nworks include a history of the fishes of New York (1814), and additions\r\nto an edition of Bewick’s General History of Quadrupeds. The latter,\r\npublished in 1804, contains descriptions and figures of some American\r\nspecies and is the first American work on mammals.\r\n\r\nPeck has the distinction of writing the first paper on systematic\r\nzoology published in America. This was a description of new species of\r\nfishes and was printed in 1794. He is also well known for his work on\r\ninsects and fungi.\r\n\r\nJefferson in 1781 published an interesting book describing the natural\r\nhistory of Virginia, and during his presidency was of inestimable\r\nservice to zoology through his support of scientific expeditions to the\r\nwestern portions of the country.\r\n\r\nPrevious to Agassiz’s introduction of laboratory methods of study in\r\ncomparative anatomy and embryology in 1847, American naturalists\r\ngenerally confined their attention to the study of the classification\r\nand habits of the multitude of undescribed animals and plants of the\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nSuch studies were naturally begun on the larger and more generally\r\ninteresting animals such as the birds and mammals, and although many of\r\nthese were fairly well described as to species before the opening of the\r\nnineteenth century, little was known of their habits. The natural\r\nhistory of our eastern birds first became well known through the\r\naccurate illustrations and exquisitely written descriptions of Alexander\r\nWilson (in 1808–1813). Bonaparte’s continuation of Wilson’s work was\r\npublished in four folio volumes beginning in 1826.\r\n\r\nIn 1828 appeared the first of Audubon’s magnificent folio illustrations\r\nof our birds. These were published in England, with later editions of\r\nsmaller plates in America. Nuttall’s Manual of the Ornithology of the\r\nUnited States appeared in 1832–1834.\r\n\r\nThe second work on American mammals appeared in the second American\r\nedition of Guthrie’s Geography, published in 1815. The author is\r\nsupposed to have been George Ord, although his name does not appear. In\r\n1825 Harlan published his “Fauna Americana: Descriptions of the\r\nMammiferous Animals inhabiting North America.” This was largely a\r\ncompilation from European writers, particularly from Demarest’s\r\nMammalogie, and had little value.\r\n\r\nIn 1826 Amos Eaton published a small “Zoological Text-book comprising\r\nCuvier’s four grand divisions of Animals: also Shaw’s improved Linnean\r\ngenera, arranged according to the classes and orders of Cuvier and\r\nLatreille. Short descriptions of some of the most common species are\r\ngiven for students’ exercises. Prepared for Rensselaer school and the\r\npopular class room.” “Four hundred and sixty-one genera are described in\r\nthis text-book. They embrace every known species of the Animal Kingdom.”\r\nThis is a compilation from European sources with a few American species\r\nof various groups included. On the other hand, Godman’s Natural History,\r\nin three volumes (1826–1828), was an illustrated and creditable work.\r\nSuch was also the case with Sir John Richardson’s Fauna Boreali\r\nAmericana of which the volume on quadrupeds was published in England in\r\n1829. The other volumes on birds, fishes and insects appeared between\r\n1827 and 1836. Audubon and Bachman’s beautifully illustrated “Quadrupeds\r\nof North America” was issued between 1841 and 1850.\r\n\r\nAbout 1840 several of the states inaugurated natural history surveys and\r\npublished catalogues of the local faunas. The reports on the animals of\r\nMassachusetts and New York are the most complete zoological monographs\r\npublished in America up to that time. This is particularly true of\r\nDeKay’s Natural History of New York published between 1842 and 1844 in\r\nbeautifully illustrated quarto volumes.\r\n\r\nThe leader in the systematic studies in the early part of the century\r\nwas Thomas Say, who published descriptions of a large number of new\r\nspecies of animals, particularly reptiles, mollusks, crustacea and\r\ninsects. Say’s conchology, printed in 1816 in Nicholson’s Cyclopedia, is\r\nthe first American work of its kind. This was reprinted in 1819 under\r\nthe title “Land and Fresh-water Shells of the United States.” In\r\n1824–1828 appeared the three volumes of Say’s American Entomology.\r\n\r\nThe prominent position held by Say in the zoological work of this period\r\nis illustrated by the following paragraph from Eaton’s Zoological\r\nText-book (1826, p. 133): “At present but a small proportion of American\r\nAnimals, excepting those of large size, have been sought out ... And\r\nthough Mr. Say is doing much; without assistance, his life must be\r\nprotracted to a very advanced period to afford him time to complete the\r\nwork. But if every student will contribute his mite, by sending Mr. Say\r\nduplicates of all undescribed species, we shall probably be in\r\npossession of a system, very nearly complete, in a few years.” How\r\ndifferent is the attitude of the zoologist of to-day who sees the goal\r\nmuch further away after a century’s progress through the industry of\r\nhundreds of investigators.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of Say’s most active work he is reported to have\r\n“slept in the hall of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences,\r\nwhere he made his bed beneath the skeleton of a horse and fed himself on\r\nbread and milk.”\r\n\r\nNext to Say, the most active zoologist of the early part of the century\r\nwas Charles Alexander Lesueur, who described and beautifully illustrated\r\nmany new species of fishes, reptiles, and marine invertebrates. A memoir\r\nby George Ord, published in this Journal (=8=, 189, 1849), gives a full\r\nlist of Lesueur’s papers.\r\n\r\nOne of the most prolific writers of the period was Constantine\r\nRafinesque, a man of great brilliancy but one whose imagination so often\r\ndominated his observations that many of his descriptions of plants and\r\nanimals are wholly unreliable.\r\n\r\n_United States Exploring Expedition._—In 1838 a fortunate circumstance\r\noccurred which eventually brought American systematic zoology into the\r\nfront ranks of the science. This opportunity was offered by the United\r\nStates Exploring Expedition under the command of Admiral Wilkes. With\r\nJames D. Dana as naturalist, the expedition visited Madeira, Cape Verde\r\nIslands, eastern and western coasts of South America, Polynesia, Samoa,\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, Fiji, Hawaiian Islands, west coast of United\r\nStates, Philippines, Singapore, Cape of Good Hope, etc.\r\n\r\nOf the extensive collections made on this four-years’ cruise, Dana had\r\ndevoted particular attention to the study of the corals and allied\r\nanimals (Zoophytes) and to the crustacea. In 1846 the report on the\r\nZoophytes was published in elegant folio form with colored plates. Six\r\nyears later the first volume of the report on Crustacea appeared, with a\r\nsecond volume after two additional years (1854). These reports describe\r\nand beautifully illustrate hundreds of new species, and include the\r\nfirst comprehensive studies of the animals forming well-known corals.\r\nThey remain as the most conspicuous monuments in American invertebrate\r\nzoology. Unfortunately the very limited edition makes them accessible in\r\nonly a few large libraries. The other, equally magnificent, volumes\r\ninclude: Mollusca and Shells, by A. A. Gould, 1856; Herpetology, by\r\nCharles Girard, 1858; Mammalogy and Ornithology, by John Cassin, 1858.\r\n\r\n_Principal investigators._—Of the many writers on animals at this period\r\nof descriptive natural history, the following were prominent in their\r\nspecial fields of study:\r\n\r\nAyres, Lesueur, Mitchill, Storer, Linsley, Wyman, DeKay, Smith,\r\nKirtland, Rafinesque and Haldeman described the fishes.\r\n\r\nGreen, Barton, Harlan, Le Conte, Say, and especially Holbrook, studied\r\nthe reptiles and amphibia. Holbrook’s great monograph of the reptiles\r\n(North American Herpetology) was published between 1834 and 1845.\r\n\r\nWilson, Audubon, Nuttall, Cooper, DeKay, Brewer, Ord, Baird, Gould,\r\nBachman, Linsley and Fox were among the numerous writers on birds.\r\n\r\nGodman, Ord, Richardson, Audubon, Bachman, DeKay, Linsley and Harlan\r\npublished accounts of mammals.\r\n\r\nOn the invertebrates an important general work entitled “Invertebrata of\r\nMassachusetts; Mollusca, Crustacea, Annelida and Radiata” was published\r\nby A. A. Gould in 1841, which contains all the New England species of\r\nthese groups known to that date.\r\n\r\nLea, Totten, Adams, Barnes, Gould, Binney, Conrad, Hildreth, Haldeman,\r\nwere the principal writers on mollusks. The crustacea were studied by\r\nSay, Gould, Haldeman, Dana; the insects by Say, Melsheimer, Peck,\r\nHarris, Kirby, Herrick; the spiders by Hentz; the worms by Lee; the\r\ncoelenterates and echinoderms by Say, Mantell and others.\r\n\r\nThe history of entomology in the United States previous to 1846 is given\r\nby John G. Morris in the Journal (=1=, =17=, 1846). In this article F.\r\nV. Melsheimer is stated to be the father of American Entomology, while\r\nSay was the most prolific writer. Say’s entomological papers, edited by\r\nJ. L. Le Conte, were completely reprinted with their colored\r\nillustrations in 1859. The first economic treatise is that by Harris on\r\nInsects Injurious to Vegetation; printed in 1841. This has had many\r\neditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Zoology in the American Journal of Science, 1818–1846._\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the Journal gave a further impetus to the\r\nscientific activities of Americans in furnishing a convenient means for\r\npublishing the results of their work. In the first volume of the\r\nJournal, for example, are two zoological articles by Say and a dozen\r\nshort articles on various topics by Rafinesque, the latter being curious\r\ncombinations of facts and fancy. Most of the zoological papers appearing\r\nin its first series of 50 volumes are characteristic of an undeveloped\r\nscience in an undeveloped country. They deal, naturally, with\r\nobservational studies on the structure and classification of species\r\ndiscovered in a virgin field, with notes on habits and life histories.\r\n\r\nMany of the papers are purely systematic and include the first\r\ndescriptions of numerous species of our mollusks, crustacea, insects,\r\nvertebrates and other groups. Of these, the writings of C. B. Adams,\r\nBarnes, A. A. Gould and Totten on mollusks, of J. D. Dana on corals and\r\ncrustacea, of Harris on insects, of Harlan on reptiles, and of Jeffries\r\nWyman and D. Humphreys Storer on fishes are representative and\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nThe progress of zoology in America during the first twenty-eight years\r\nof the Journal’s existence, that is, up to the year 1846, is thus\r\nsummarized by Professor Silliman in the preface to vol. 50 (page ix),\r\n1847:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Our zoology has been more fully investigated than our mineralogy and\r\n  botany; but neither department is in danger of being exhausted. The\r\n  interesting travels of Lewis and Clark have recently brought to our\r\n  knowledge several plants and animals before unknown. Foreign\r\n  naturalists are frequently visiting our territory; and, for the most\r\n  part, convey to Europe the fruits of their researches, while but a\r\n  small part of our own is examined and described by Americans:\r\n  certainly this is little to our credit and still less to our\r\n  advantage. Honorable exceptions to the truth of this remark are\r\n  furnished by the exertions of some gentlemen in our principal cities,\r\n  and in various other parts of the Union.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring these 28 years the Journal had been of great service to zoology\r\nnot only in the publication of the results of investigations but also in\r\nthe review of important zoological publications in Europe as well as in\r\nAmerica. There were also the reports of meetings of scientific\r\nsocieties. In fact all matters of zoological interest were brought to\r\nthe attention of the Journal’s readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _The Influence of Louis Agassiz._\r\n\r\nAt the time of the founding of the Journal and for nearly thirty years\r\nthereafter descriptive natural history constituted practically the\r\nentire work of American zoologists. In this respect American science was\r\nfar behind that in Europe and particularly in France. It was not until\r\nthe fortunate circumstances which brought the Swiss naturalist, Louis\r\nAgassiz, to our country in 1846 that the modern conceptions of\r\nbiological science were established in America.\r\n\r\nAgassiz was then 39 years of age and had already absorbed the spirit of\r\ngeneralization in comparative anatomy which dominated the work of the\r\ngreat leaders in Europe, and particularly in Paris. The influence of\r\nLeuckart, Tiedemann, Braun, Cuvier and Von Humboldt directed Agassiz’s\r\ngreat ability to similar investigations, and he was rapidly coming into\r\nprominence in the study of modern and fossil fishes when the opportunity\r\nto continue his research in America was presented. On arriving on our\r\nshores the young zoologist was so inspired with the opportunities for\r\nhis studies in the new country that he decided to remain.\r\n\r\nBringing with him the broad conceptions of his distinguished European\r\nmasters, he naturally founded a similar school of zoology in America. It\r\nis from this beginning that the present science of zoology with its many\r\nbranches has developed.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered in this connection that the great service which\r\nAgassiz rendered to American zoology consisted mainly in making\r\navailable to students in America the ideals and methods of European\r\nzoologists. This he was eminently fitted to do both because of his\r\nEuropean training and because of his natural ability as an inspiring\r\nleader.\r\n\r\nThe times in America, moreover, were fully ripe for the advent of\r\nEuropean culture. There were already in existence natural history\r\nsocieties in many of our cities and college communities. These societies\r\nnot only held meetings for the discussion of biological topics, but\r\nestablished museums open to the public, and to which the public was\r\ninvited to contribute both funds and specimens. This led to a wide\r\npopular interest in natural history. It was therefore comparatively easy\r\nfor such a man as Agassiz to develop this favorable public attitude into\r\ngenuine enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe American Journal of Science announces the expected visit of Agassiz\r\nas a most promising event for American Zoology (=1=, 451, 1846): “His\r\ndevotion, ability, and zeal—his high and deserved reputation and ... his\r\namiable and conciliating character, will, without doubt, secure for him\r\nthe cordial cooperation of our naturalists ... nor do we entertain a\r\ndoubt that we shall be liberally repaid by his able review and\r\nexploration of our country.” We of to-day can realize how abundantly\r\nthis prophecy was fulfilled.\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding volume (=2=, 440, 1846) occurs the record of Agassiz’s\r\narrival. “We learn with pleasure that he will spend several years among\r\nus, in order thoroughly to understand our natural history.”\r\n\r\nImmediately on reaching Boston, Agassiz began the publication of\r\narticles on our fauna, and the following year he was appointed to a\r\nprofessorship at Harvard. The Journal says (=4=, 449, 1847): “Every\r\nscientific man in America will be rejoiced to hear so unexpected a piece\r\nof good news.” The next year the Journal (5, 139, 1848) records\r\nAgassiz’s lecture courses at New York and Charleston, his popularity\r\nwith all classes of the people and the gift of a silver case containing\r\n$250 in half eagles from the students of the College of Physicians and\r\nSurgeons.\r\n\r\nThe service of Agassiz to American zoology, therefore, consisted not\r\nonly in the publication of the results of his researches and his\r\nphilosophical considerations therefrom, but also, and perhaps in even\r\ngreater degree, in the popularization of science. In the latter\r\ndirection were his inspiring lectures before popular audiences and the\r\nearly publication of a zoological text-book. This book, published in\r\n1848, was entitled “Principles of Zoology, touching the Structure,\r\nDevelopment, Distribution and Natural arrangement of the races of\r\nAnimals, living and extinct, with numerous illustrations.” It was\r\nwritten with the cooperation of Augustus A. Gould. The review of this\r\nbook in the Journal (=6=, 151, 1848) indicates clearly the broad modern\r\nprinciples underlying the new era which was beginning for American\r\nzoology.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “A work emanating from so high a source as the Principles of Zoology,\r\n  hardly requires commendation to give it currency. The public have\r\n  become acquainted with the eminent abilities of Prof. Agassiz through\r\n  his lectures, and are aware of his vast learning, wide reach of mind,\r\n  and popular mode of illustrating scientific subjects ... The volume is\r\n  prepared for the student in zoological science; it is simple and\r\n  elementary in style, full in its illustrations, comprehensive in its\r\n  range, yet well considered and brought into the narrow compass\r\n  requisite for the purpose intended.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe titles of its chapters will show how little it differs in general\r\nsubject matter from the most recent text-book in biology. Chapter I, The\r\nSphere and fundamental principles of Zoology; II, General Properties of\r\nOrganized Bodies; III, Organs and Functions of Animal Life; IV, Of\r\nIntelligence and Instinct; V, Of Motion (apparatus and modes); VI, Of\r\nNutrition; VII, Of the Blood and Circulation; VIII, Of Respiration; IX,\r\nOf the Secretions; X, Embryology (Egg and its Development); XI, Peculiar\r\nModes of Reproduction; XII, Metamorphoses of Animals; XIII, Geographical\r\nDistribution of Animals; XIV, Geological Succession of Animals, or their\r\nDistribution in Time.\r\n\r\nA moment’s consideration of the fact that all these topics are\r\nexcellently treated will show how great had been the progress of zoology\r\nin the first half of the nineteenth century. The sixty years that have\r\nelapsed since the publication of this book have served principally to\r\ndevelop these separate lines of biology into special fields of science\r\nwithout reorganization of the essential principles here recognized. This\r\nremained for many years the standard zoological and physiological\r\ntext-book, and was republished in several editions here and in England.\r\nAnother popular book is entitled “Methods of Study in Natural History”\r\n(1864).\r\n\r\nMore than 400 books and papers were written by Agassiz, over a third of\r\nwhich were published before he came to America. They cover both\r\nzoological and geological topics, including systematic papers on living\r\nand fossil groups of animals, but most important of all are his\r\nphilosophical essays on the general principles of biology.\r\n\r\nOne of Agassiz’s greatest services to zoology was the publication of his\r\n“Bibliographia Zoologiæ et Geologiæ” by the Ray Society, beginning with\r\n1848. The publication of the Lowell lectures in Comparative Embryology\r\nin 1849 gave wide audience to the general principles now recognized in\r\nthe biogenetic law of ancestral reminiscence. As stated in the Journal\r\n(=8=, 157, 1849), the “object of the Lectures is to demonstrate that a\r\nnatural method of classifying the animal kingdom may be attained by a\r\ncomparison of the changes which are passed through by different animals\r\nin the course of their development from the egg to the perfect state;\r\nthe change they undergo being considered as a scale to appreciate the\r\nrelative position of the species.” These “principles of classification”\r\nare fully elucidated in a separate pamphlet, and are discussed at length\r\nin the Journal (=11=, 122, 1851).\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting of Agassiz’s numerous philosophical essays,\r\noriginally contributed to the Journal (9, 369, 1850), discusses the\r\n“Natural Relations between Animals and the elements in which they live.”\r\nAnother philosophical paper contributed to the Journal discusses the\r\n“Primitive diversity and number of Animals in Geological times” (=17=,\r\n309, 1854). Of his systematic papers, those on the fishes of the\r\nTennessee river, describing many new species, were published in the\r\nJournal (=17=, 297, 353, 1854).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ls Agassiz]\r\n\r\nAgassiz’s beautifully illustrated “Contributions to the Natural History\r\nof the United States” cover many subjects in morphology and embryology,\r\nwhich are treated with such thoroughness and breadth of view as to give\r\nthem a place among the zoological classics. The Essay on Classification,\r\nthe North American Testudinata, the Embryology of the turtle, and the\r\nAcalephs are the special topics. These are summarized and discussed at\r\nlength in the Journal (=25=, 126, 202, 321, 342, 1858; =30=, 142, 1860;\r\n=31=, 295, 1861).\r\n\r\nThe volume on the “Journey in Brazil” (1868) in joint authorship with\r\nMrs. Agassiz is a fascinating narrative of exploration.\r\n\r\nThe conceptions which Agassiz held as to the most essential aim of\r\nzoological study are well illustrated in his autobiographical sketch,\r\nwhere he writes:[174]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “I did not then know how much more important it is to the naturalist\r\n  to understand the structure of a few animals, than to command the\r\n  whole field of scientific nomenclature. Since I have become a teacher,\r\n  and have watched the progress of students, I have seen that they all\r\n  begin in the same way; but how many have grown old in the pursuit,\r\n  without ever rising to any higher conception of the study of nature,\r\n  spending their life in the determination of species, and in extending\r\n  scientific terminology!”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, then, that under such influence the older\r\nsystematic studies should be replaced in large measure by those of a\r\nmorphological and embryological nature.\r\n\r\nThe personal influence of Agassiz is still felt in the lives of even the\r\nyounger zoologists of the present day. For the investigators of the\r\npresent generation are for the most part indebted to one or another of\r\nAgassiz’s pupils for their guidance in zoological studies. These pupils\r\ninclude his son Alexander Agassiz, Allen, Brooks, Clarke, Fewkes, Goode,\r\nHyatt, Jordan, Lyman, Morse, Packard, Scudder, Verrill, Wilder, and\r\nothers—leaders in zoological work during the last third of the\r\nnineteenth century. Through such men as these the inspiration of Agassiz\r\nhas been handed on in turn to their pupils and from them to the younger\r\ngeneration of zoologists.\r\n\r\nThe essential difference between the work of Agassiz and that of the\r\nAmerican zoologists who preceded him was in his power of broad\r\ngeneralizations. To him the organism meant a living witness of some\r\ngreat natural law, in the interpretation of which zoology was engaged.\r\nThe organism in its structure, in its development, in its habits\r\nfurnished links in the chain of evidence which, when completed, would\r\nreveal the meaning of nature. Of all Agassiz’s pupils, probably William\r\nK. Brooks most fittingly perpetuated his master’s ideals.\r\n\r\n\r\n           _Period of Morphology and Embryology, 1847–1870._\r\n\r\nThe new aspect of zoology which came as a result of the influence of\r\nAgassiz characterized the zoological work of the fifties and sixties,\r\nthat is, until the significance of the natural selection theory of\r\nDarwin and Wallace became generally appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe work in these years and well into the seventies was largely\r\ninfluenced by the morphological, embryological and systematic studies of\r\nLouis Agassiz and his school. The structure, development, and homologies\r\nof animals as indicating their relationship and position in the scheme\r\nof classification was prominent in the work of this period. The\r\nadaptations of animals to their environment and the application of the\r\nbiogenetic law to the various groups of animals were also favorite\r\nsubjects of study.\r\n\r\nThe most successful investigators in this period on the different groups\r\nof animals include:—Louis Agassiz on the natural history and embryology\r\nof coelenterates and turtles; A. Agassiz, embryology of echinoderms and\r\nworms; H. J. Clark, embryology of turtles and systematic papers on\r\nsponges and coelenterates; E. Desor, echinoderms and embryology of\r\nworms; C. Girard, embryology, worms, and reptiles; J. Leidy, protozoa,\r\ncoelenterates, worms, anatomy of mollusks; W. O. Ayres and T. Lyman,\r\nnatural history of echinoderms; McCrady, development of acalephs; W.\r\nStimpson, marine invertebrates; A. E. Verrill, coelenterates,\r\nechinoderms, worms; A. Hyatt, evolutionary theories, bryozoa and\r\nmollusks; Pourtales, deep sea fauna; C. B. Adams, A. and W. G. Binney,\r\nBrooks, Carpenter, Conrad, Dall, Jay, Lea, S. Smith, Tryon, mollusks; E.\r\nS. Morse, brachiopods, mollusks; J. D. Dana, coelenterates and\r\nCrustacea; Kirtland, Loew, Edwards, Hagen, Melsheimer, Packard, Riley,\r\nScudder, Walsh, insects; Gill, Holbrook, Storer, fishes; Cope,\r\nevolutionary theories, fishes and amphibia; Baird, reptiles and birds;\r\nJ. A. Allen, amphibia, reptiles and birds; Brewer, Cassin, Coues,\r\nLawrence, birds; Audubon, Bachman, Baird, Cope, Wilder, mammals.\r\n\r\nThe progress of ornithology in the United States previous to 1876 is\r\nwell described in a paper by J. A. Allen in the American Naturalist\r\n(=10=, 536, 1876). A sketch of the early history of conchology is given\r\nby A. W. Tryon in the Journal (=33=, 13, 1862).\r\n\r\nJeffries Wyman was the most prominent comparative anatomist of this\r\nperiod. His work includes classic papers on the anatomy and embryology\r\nof fishes, amphibia, and reptiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Zoology in the American Journal of Science, 1846–1870._\r\n\r\nThe fifty volumes of the second series of the Journal, including the\r\nyears 1846 to 1870, cover approximately this period of morphology and\r\nembryology. During this period the Journal occupied a very important\r\nplace in zoological circles, for J. D. Dana was for most of this period\r\nthe editor-in-chief, while Louis Agassiz and Asa Gray were connected\r\nwith it as associate editors. Moreover, in 1864 one of the most\r\npromising of Agassiz’s pupils, Addison E. Verrill, was called to Yale as\r\nprofessor of zoology and was made an associate editor in 1869.\r\n\r\nIn the Journal, therefore, may be found, in its original articles,\r\ntogether with its reports of meetings and addresses and its reviews of\r\nliterature, a fairly complete account of the zoological activity of the\r\nperiod. The most important zoological researches, both in Europe and\r\nAmerica, were reviewed in the bibliographic notices.\r\n\r\nThe most important series of zoological articles are by Dana himself. As\r\nhis work on the zoophytes and crustacea of the U. S. Exploring\r\nExpedition continued, he published from time to time general summaries\r\nof his conclusions regarding the relationships of the various groups.\r\nIncluded among these papers are philosophical essays on general\r\nbiological principles which must have had much influence on the\r\nbiological studies of the time, and which form a basis for many of our\r\npresent concepts.\r\n\r\nThe importance of these papers warrants the list being given in full.\r\nThe titles are here in many cases abbreviated and the subjects\r\nconsolidated.\r\n\r\n\r\n  General views on Classification, =1=, 286, 1846.\r\n\r\n  Zoophytes, =2=, 64, 187, 1846; =3=, 1, 160, 337, 1847.\r\n\r\n  Genus Astraea, =9=, 295, 1850.\r\n\r\n  Conspectus crustaceorum, =8=, 276, 424, 1849; =9=, 129, 1850; =11=,\r\n  268, 1851.\r\n\r\n  Genera of Gammaracea, =8=, 135, 1849; of Cyclopacea, =1=, 225, 1846.\r\n\r\n  Markings of Carapax of Crabs, =11=, 95, 1851.\r\n\r\n  Classification of Crustacea, =11=, 223, 425; =12=, 121, 238, 1851;\r\n  =13=, 119; =14=, 297, 1852; =22=, 14, 1856.\r\n\r\n  Geographical distribution of Crustacea, =18=, 314, 1854; =19=, 6;\r\n  =20=, 168, 349, 1855.\r\n\r\n  Alternation of Generations in Plants and Radiata, =10=, 341, 1850.\r\n\r\n  Parthenogenesis, =24=, 399, 1857.\r\n\r\n  On Species, =24=, 305, 1857.\r\n\r\n  Classification of Mammals, =35=, 65, 1863; =37=, 157, 1864.\r\n\r\n  Cephalization, =22=, 14, 1856; 36, =1=, 321, 440, 1863; =37=, 10, 157,\r\n  184, 1864; =41=, 163, 1866; =12=, 245, 1876.\r\n\r\n  Homologies of insectean and crustacean types, =36=, 233, 1863; =47=,\r\n  325, 1894.\r\n\r\n  Origin of life, =41=, 389, 1866.\r\n\r\n  Relations of death to life in nature, =34=, 316, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the above, the articles on cephalization as a fundamental principle\r\nin the development of the system of animal life have attracted much\r\nattention. The evidence from comparative anatomy, paleontology, and\r\nembryology alike supports the view that advance in the ontogenetic as\r\nwell as in the phylogenetic stages is correlated with the unequal growth\r\nof the cephalic region as compared with the rest of the body. Dana shows\r\nthat this principle holds good for all groups of animals. His homologies\r\nof the limbs of arthropods and vertebrates, however, do not accord with\r\nmore modern views.\r\n\r\nOther papers on the same and allied topics were published by Dana in\r\nother periodicals. His most conspicuous zoological works, however, are\r\nhis reports on the Zoophytes and Crustacea of the United States\r\nExploring Expedition, 1837–1842. The former consists of 741 quarto pages\r\nand 61 folio plates, describing over 200 new species, while the\r\nCrustacea report, in two volumes, has 1620 pages and 96 folio plates,\r\nwith descriptions of about 500 new species. Each of these remains to-day\r\nas the most important contribution to the classification of the\r\nrespective groups. The relationships of the species, genera and families\r\nwere recognized with such remarkable judgment that Dana’s admirable\r\nsystem of classification has remained the basis for all subsequent work.\r\n\r\nDana’s critical reviews (=25=, 202, 321, 1858) of Agassiz’s\r\n“Contribution to the Natural History of the United States” are among the\r\nmost interesting of his philosophical discussions concerning the\r\nrelationships of animals as revealed by their structure, their\r\nembryology, and their geological history.\r\n\r\nThe remaining zoological articles in this series cover nearly the whole\r\nrange of systematic zoology. Especially important are the articles by\r\nVerrill on coelenterates, echinoderms, worms and other invertebrates.\r\n\r\nIn the years following the publication of Darwin’s Origin of Species in\r\n1859 occur many articles on the theory of natural selection. Some of the\r\nwriters attack the theory, while others give it more or less\r\nenthusiastic support.\r\n\r\nExperimental methods in solving biological problems were little used at\r\nthis time, although a few articles of this nature appear in the Journal.\r\nOf these, a paper by W. C. Minor (35, 35, 1863) on natural and\r\nartificial fission in some annelids has considerable interest to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Exploring Expeditions._\r\n\r\nOf the important zoological expeditions the following may be selected as\r\nshowing their influence on American Zoology:\r\n\r\nThe North Pacific Expedition, with William Stimpson as zoologist,\r\nreturned in 1856 with much new information concerning the marine life of\r\nthe coasts of Alaska and Japan and many new species of invertebrates.\r\n\r\nIn 1867–1869 the United States Coast Survey extended its explorations to\r\ninclude the deep sea marine life off the southeastern coasts and Gulf of\r\nMexico under the leadership of Pourtales and Agassiz.\r\n\r\nThe Challenger explorations (1872–1876) added greatly to the knowledge\r\nof marine life off the American coast as well as in other parts of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe explorations of the United States Fish Commission succeeded those of\r\nthe Coast Survey in the collection of marine life off our coasts and in\r\nour fresh waters. These have continued since 1872 and have yielded most\r\nimportant results from both the scientific and economic standpoints.\r\n\r\nUnder the charge of Alexander Agassiz the Coast Survey Steamer “Blake,”\r\nin 1877 to 1880, was engaged in dredging operations in three cruises to\r\nvarious parts of the Atlantic. The U. S. Fish Commission Steamer\r\n“Albatross,” also in charge of Agassiz, made three expeditions in the\r\ntropical and other parts of the Pacific in the years from 1891 to 1905.\r\nThe study of these collections has added greatly to our knowledge of\r\nsystematic zoology and geographical distribution. The reports on some of\r\nthe groups are still in course of preparation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Period of Evolution, 1870–1890._\r\n\r\nThe time from 1870 to 1890 may be appropriately called the period of\r\nevolution, for although it commences eleven years after the publication\r\nof the Origin of Species, the importance of the natural selection theory\r\nwas but slowly receiving general recognition. The hesitation in\r\naccepting this theory was due in no small degree to the opposition of\r\nLouis Agassiz. After the acceptance of evolution, although morphological\r\nand embryological studies continued as before, they were prosecuted with\r\nreference to their bearing on evolutionary problems.\r\n\r\nFollowing closely the methods which had produced so much progress during\r\nthe life of Agassiz, the field of zoology was now occupied by a new\r\ngeneration, among whom the pupils of Agassiz were the most prominent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thomas H. Huxley]\r\n\r\nThe teaching of biology at this time was also strongly influenced by\r\nHuxley, whose methods of conducting laboratory classes for elementary\r\nstudents were adopted in most of our large schools and colleges. This\r\nplaced biology on the same plane with chemistry as a means for training\r\nin laboratory methods and discipline, with the added advantage that the\r\nsubject of biology is much more intimately connected with the student’s\r\neveryday life and affairs.\r\n\r\nThis increasing demand for instruction in biology and the consequent\r\nnecessity for more teachers brought an increasing number of\r\ninvestigators into this field.\r\n\r\nConspicuous in this period was the work of E. D. Cope, best known as a\r\npaleontologist, but whose work on the classification of the various\r\ngroups of vertebrates stands preeminent, and whose philosophical essays\r\non evolution had much influence on the evolutionary thought of the time.\r\nHe was a staunch supporter of the Lamarckian doctrine. Alpheus Hyatt\r\nalso maintained this theory, and brought together a great accumulation\r\nof facts in its support. He thereby contributed largely to our knowledge\r\nof comparative anatomy and embryology. A. S. Packard, whose publications\r\ncover a wide range of topics, was best known for his text-books of\r\nzoology and his manuals on insects.\r\n\r\nW. K. Brooks was a leading morphologist and embryologist. S. F. Baird,\r\nfor many years the head of the United States Fish Commission, was the\r\nforemost authority on fish and fisheries and is also noted for his work\r\non reptiles, birds and mammals. The man of greatest influence, although\r\nby no means the greatest investigator, was C. O. Whitman. It is to him\r\nthat we owe the inception of the Marine Biological Laboratory, the most\r\npotent influence in American zoology to-day; the organization of the\r\nAmerican Morphological Society, the forerunner of the present American\r\nSociety of Zoologists; and the establishment of the Journal of\r\nMorphology. G. B. Goode was distinguished for his work on fishes and for\r\nhis writings on the history of science.\r\n\r\nE. L. Mark, C. S. Minot, and Alexander Agassiz were acknowledged leaders\r\nin their special fields of research—Mark in invertebrate morphology and\r\nembryology, and Minot in vertebrate embryology, while Alexander Agassiz\r\nmade many important discoveries in the systematic zoology and embryology\r\nof marine animals, and to him we owe in large measure our knowledge of\r\nthe life in the oceans of nearly all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of the representatives of the different divisions of the\r\nAmerican fauna had now become sufficient to allow the publication of\r\nmonographs on the various classes, orders and families. At this time\r\nalso particular attention was given to the marine invertebrates of all\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nOf the many investigators working on the various groups of animals at\r\nthis time only a few may be mentioned. The protozoa were studied by\r\nLeidy, Clark, Ryder, Stokes; the sponges by Clark, Hyatt; the\r\ncoelenterates by A. Agassiz, S. F. Clarke, Verrill; the echinoderms by\r\nA. Agassiz, Brooks, Kingsley, Fewkes, Lyman, Verrill; the various groups\r\nof worms by Benedict, Eisen, Silliman, Verrill, Webster, Whitman; the\r\nmollusks by A. and W. G. Binney, Tryon, Conrad, Dall, Sanderson Smith,\r\nStearns, Verrill; the Brachiopods by Dall and Morse; the Bryozoa by\r\nHyatt; the crustacea by S. I. Smith, Harger, Hagen, Packard, Kingsley,\r\nFaxon, Herrick; the insects by Packard, Horn, Scudder, C. H. Fernald,\r\nWilliston, Norton, Walsh, Fitch, J. B. Smith, Comstock, Howard, Riley\r\nand many others; spiders by Emerton, Marx, McCook; tunicates by Packard\r\nand Verrill; fishes by Baird, Bean, Cope, Gilbert, Gill, Goode, Jordan,\r\nPutnam; amphibians and reptiles by Cope; birds by Baird, Brewer, Coues,\r\nElliott, Henshaw, Allen, Merriam, Brewster, Ridgway; and the mammals by\r\nAllen, Baird, Cope, Coues, Elliott, Merriam, Wilder.\r\n\r\nInterest in the evolutionary theory continued to increase and eventually\r\ndeveloped into the morphological and embryological studies which reached\r\ntheir culmination between 1885 and 1890 under the guidance of Whitman,\r\nMark, Minot, Brooks, Kingsley, E. B. Wilson and other famous zoologists\r\nof the time. In these years the Journal of Morphology was established\r\nand the American Morphological Society was formed.\r\n\r\nThe morphological, embryological and paleontological evidences of\r\nevolution as indicated by homologies, developmental stages and\r\nadaptations were the most absorbing subjects of zoological research and\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A. E. Verrill March 1904]\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Zoology in the American Journal of Science, 1870–1918._\r\n\r\nThe third series of the Journal (1870–1895), likewise including fifty\r\nvolumes, embraces this period of zoological activity in morphological\r\nand embryological studies, culminating with the inception of the modern\r\nexperimental methods.\r\n\r\nIn this period also occurred the greatest progress in marine systematic\r\nzoology, due to the explorations of the United States Fish Commission\r\noff the Atlantic Coast. The Journal had an important share in the\r\nzoological development of this period also, for A. E. Verrill, who was\r\nnow an associate editor, was in charge of the collections of marine\r\ninvertebrates. Consequently most of the discoveries in this field were\r\npublished in the Journal in numerous original contributions by Verrill\r\nand his associates. The explorations of the U. S. Fish Commission\r\nSteamer “Albatross” are described from year to year by Verrill, with\r\ndescriptions of the new species of invertebrates discovered.\r\n\r\nThe numerous original contributions by Verrill on subjects of general\r\nzoological interest as well as on those of a systematic nature give this\r\nthird series of the Journal much zoological importance. Verrill’s papers\r\ncover almost the whole field of descriptive zoology, but are mainly\r\ndevoted to marine invertebrates.

Gulick (=39=, 21; =40=, 1, 437) which have attracted much\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of this period, however, the Journal was relieved from\r\nthe necessity of publishing zoological articles by the establishment of\r\nseveral periodicals devoted especially to the various fields of zoology.\r\nWe find, therefore, but few exclusively zoological papers after 1885,\r\nalthough articles of a general biological interest and the reviews of\r\nzoological books continue.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth series of the Journal, beginning in 1896, occur also a\r\nnumber of articles on systematic zoology by Verrill and others and\r\nseveral papers having a general biological interest. Brief reviews of a\r\nsmall number of zoological books are still continued, but at the present\r\nday the Journal, which played so important a part in the early\r\ndevelopment of American zoology, has been given over to the geological\r\nand physical sciences in harmony with the modern demand for\r\nspecialization.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _Period of Experimental Biology, since 1890._\r\n\r\nZoological studies remained in large measure observational and\r\ncomparative until about 1890 when the experimental methods of Roux,\r\nDriesch and others came into prominence. Interest then turned from the\r\naccumulation of facts to an analysis of the underlying principles of\r\nbiological phenomena. The question now was not so much what the organism\r\ndoes as how it does what is observed, and this question could be\r\nanswered only by the experimental control of the conditions. These\r\nexperimental studies met with such remarkable success that in a few\r\nyears the older morphological studies were largely abandoned, the\r\nMorphological Society changed its name to the Society of Zoologists, and\r\nin 1904 the Journal of Experimental Zoology was established. The\r\nexperimental methods were applied to all branches of biological science,\r\nand while it must be freely admitted that little progress has been made\r\ntoward an understanding of the ultimate causes which underlie biological\r\nphenomena, a great advance has been made in the elucidation of the\r\ngeneral principles involved.\r\n\r\nExperimental embryology, histology, regeneration, comparative\r\nphysiology, neurology, cytology, and heredity have in recent years\r\nsuccessfully adopted an experimental aspect and have made significant\r\nprogress thereby. Biology has now taken its place beside chemistry and\r\nphysics as an experimental science.\r\n\r\nThe latest great advance in biology has been in the field of heredity.\r\nThe rediscovery of the Mendelian principles of heredity in 1900 brought\r\nto light the most important generalization in biology in recent times.\r\nThe new science of genetics is essentially the experimental study of\r\nheredity.\r\n\r\nWe are at the moment in the midst of an effort to establish in biology a\r\nfew relatively simple laws by using for the purpose the vast\r\naccumulations of observational data gathered in past years, supplemented\r\nby such experimental data as have been provided by these more recent\r\ninvestigations. Such hypotheses as have been formulated are for the most\r\npart only tentatively held, for their validity is generally incapable of\r\na critical test. But wherever such tests have been possible, the laws of\r\nmathematics, physics and chemistry are found applicable to biological\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nThe number of investigators has now become so great and their activities\r\nso prolific that the list and synopses of the zoological publications\r\neach year cover upwards of 1000 to 1500 pages in the International\r\nCatalogue of Scientific Literature.\r\n\r\n_American Leadership._—During the first half of the century the progress\r\nof zoology in America remained distinctly behind that of Europe. At the\r\nbeginning of the century the science was farthest developed by the\r\nFrench and English, although Linnæus was a Swede and took his degree in\r\nHolland. Under the influence of Von Baer and his monumental treatise on\r\nembryology (Ueber Entwicklungsgeschichte der Thiere, 1828), and\r\nsupported later by the great physiologist, Johannes Müller, whose\r\n“Physiologie des Menschen” (1846) forms the basis of modern physiology,\r\nthe German school forged rapidly ahead and eventually assumed the\r\nleadership in zoology, as in several other branches of science.\r\n\r\nIn the latter half of the century the influence of the German\r\nuniversities dominated in a large measure the zoological investigations\r\nin America. The reason for this is partly due to the fact that many of\r\nour young zoologists, after finishing their college course, completed\r\ntheir preparation for research by a year or more at a German university.\r\nThe more mature zoologists, too, looked forward with keen anticipation\r\nto spending their summer vacations and sabbatical years in research in a\r\nGerman laboratory or at the famous Naples station in which the German\r\ninfluence was dominant.\r\n\r\nWith the rise of experimental biology since 1890, however, the American\r\nzoologists have shown so high a degree of originality in devising\r\nexperiments, so much skill in performing them, and such keenness in\r\nanalyzing the results, that they have assumed the world leadership in\r\nseveral of the special fields into which the science of zoology is now\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Biological Periodicals._\r\n\r\nPerhaps in no better way can the progress of biology in America be\r\nillustrated than by a brief survey of the origin and development of the\r\nmore important biological journals. For it will be seen that these\r\npublications have become more numerous and more specialized as the\r\nscience has advanced in specialization.\r\n\r\nThe early publications—which as is well known, treated mainly of the\r\nbirds, mammals and other vertebrates, and of insects, crustacea and\r\nshells—consisted mainly of separate books or pamphlets, published by\r\nprivate subscription. After the establishment of the so-called Academies\r\nof Science, or of Arts and Sciences, toward the end of the eighteenth\r\nand in the first quarter of the nineteenth century, the reports of the\r\nmeetings began to be published as periodical Journals, supported by the\r\nacademies. In these publications, and in the Journal which was founded\r\nat the same time, appear papers on all branches of science, including\r\nzoology. As soon as zoology in America assumed its modern aspects\r\nthrough the influence of Louis Agassiz and his followers the earliest\r\nstrictly zoological journals were established.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted, however, that the journals of the scientific and\r\nnatural history societies were more or less fully devoted to zoological\r\ntopics according to the nature of the activities of the members and\r\ncorrespondents. After the establishment of the Museum of Comparative\r\nZoology by Louis Agassiz came the founding in 1863 of its Bulletin and\r\nlater its Memoirs. These publications have continued to the present day\r\nas a standard of excellence for the reports of zoological\r\ninvestigations. In connection with the systematic work on mollusks, the\r\nAmerican Journal of Conchology was established in 1865. The American\r\nNaturalist was founded in 1867 by four of Louis Agassiz’s pupils, Hyatt,\r\nMorse, Packard and Putnam. It was later edited by Cope as a leading\r\nperiodical for the publication of biological papers, particularly those\r\nrelating to evolution, and is at present devoted to evolutionary topics.\r\nIt is now in the 52d volume of its new series.\r\n\r\nWith the awakened interest in comparative anatomy and embryology came\r\nthe need for an American journal which should supply a means of\r\npublication for the reports of researches accomplished by the increasing\r\nnumber of workers in these fields. This need was fully met by the\r\nestablishment of the Journal of Morphology in 1887. This publication,\r\nnow in its 30th volume, has equalled the best European journals in the\r\ncharacter of its papers. A few years later (1891) came the Journal of\r\nComparative Neurology for the publication of investigations relating to\r\nthe morphology and physiology of the nervous system and to nervous and\r\nallied phenomena in all groups of organisms. Twenty-eight volumes of\r\nthis journal have been completed. The Zoological Bulletin was started\r\nunder the auspices of the Marine Biological Laboratory in 1897 for the\r\npublication of papers of a less extensive nature and which could be more\r\npromptly issued than those in the Journal of Morphology where elaborate\r\nplates were required. After two years the scope of the Bulletin was\r\nenlarged to include botanical and physiological subjects. The name was\r\ncorrespondingly changed to the Biological Bulletin. Of this important\r\nperiodical 33 volumes have been issued.\r\n\r\nFor the publication of papers on human and comparative anatomy and\r\nembryology, the American Journal of Anatomy was established in 1901, and\r\nis now in its twenty-third volume.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the trend of zoological interest was toward topics connected\r\nwith the ultimate nature of biological phenomena. The meaning of these\r\nphenomena could be determined only by the experimental method.\r\nResearches in this field became more prominent and the adequate\r\npublication of the numerous papers required the establishment of a new\r\njournal in 1904. This was named the Journal of Experimental Zoology. It\r\nimmediately took its place in the front rank of American zoological\r\nperiodicals. Twenty-four volumes have been published.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the constantly increasing number of journals, the science\r\ngrew faster than the means of publication. So crowded did the American\r\njournals become that long delays often resulted before the results of an\r\ninvestigation could be issued. This condition was met in part by the\r\nsending of many papers to be published in European journals (a necessity\r\nmost discreditable to American zoology) and in part by the establishment\r\nof additional means of publication. Of the latter the Anatomical Record,\r\nnow in its fourteenth volume, was begun in 1906 for the prompt\r\npublication of briefer papers on vertebrate anatomy, embryology and\r\nhistology and for preliminary reports and notes on technique.\r\n\r\nDuring the past few years has come a great advance in the experimental\r\nbreeding of plants and animals. Problems in heredity and evolution have\r\ntaken on a new interest since the importance and validity of Mendel’s\r\ndiscovery have been recognized. To meet this development of biology the\r\njournal Genetics was begun in 1916 for the publication of technical\r\npapers, while the Journal of Heredity, modified from the American\r\nBreeders Magazine, is devoted to popular articles on animal and plant\r\nbreeding, and Eugenics.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the science of zoology is now assuming a closer relation\r\nto practical affairs. Entomology, for example, is now represented by the\r\nJournal of Economic Entomology, of which 10 volumes have been issued\r\nsince 1907. The Journal of Animal Behavior covers another practical\r\nfield of research. The Proceedings of the Society for Experimental\r\nBiology and Medicine, starting in 1903, the American Journal of\r\nPhysiology, and several other publications cover the physiological\r\nfield. The Journal of Parasitology, established 1914, now in its fourth\r\nvolume, is devoted to the interests of medical zoology. The Auk, now in\r\nthe 34th volume of its new series (42d of old series), is the official\r\norgan of the American Ornithologists Union and is devoted to the\r\ndissemination of knowledge concerning bird life. The Annals of the\r\nEntomological Society of America, established in 1908, and now in its\r\n10th volume, is one of several important entomological journals. The\r\nNautilus, of which 28 volumes have been issued, is one of the more\r\nsuccessful journals devoted to conchology. This list might be extended\r\nto include numerous other periodicals of importance, both technical and\r\npopular, which have been of great service in the various fields of\r\nbiology.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these are the many volumes of systematic papers in the\r\nProceedings of the United States National Museum, the practical reports\r\nin the Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission, the vast\r\nliterature issued yearly by the various divisions of the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, Public Health Service and other Governmental\r\ndepartments, while the list of publications by scientific societies,\r\nmuseums, and other institutes is constantly increasing and covers all\r\nfields of biological research.\r\n\r\nAt the present time facilities for the publication of research on any\r\nbranch of zoology are as a rule entirely adequate. For this highly\r\nsatisfactory condition the science is indebted to the support given five\r\nof its most important journals by the Wistar Institute of Anatomy and\r\nBiology.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Biological Associations._\r\n\r\nAn important light on the history of biology in America can be thrown by\r\na glance at the rise and development of societies or associations for\r\nthe report and discussion of papers relating to that branch of science.\r\nIn the first half of the nineteenth century natural history societies\r\nwere formed in most cities and centers of learning. These were very\r\nimportant factors in the promotion of scientific research as well as in\r\nthe diffusion of popular knowledge of living things. The aims and\r\nactivities of twenty-nine such scientific societies, many of which were\r\ndevoted especially to natural history, are described in one of the early\r\nvolumes of the Journal (=10=, 369, 1826). The Connecticut Academy of\r\nArts and Sciences, dating from 1799, the Philadelphia Academy of Natural\r\nSciences from 1812, and the New York Lyceum of Natural History (in 1876\r\nname changed to New York Academy of Sciences) from 1817 are among the\r\noldest of those which still exist.\r\n\r\nOf national institutions the American Philosophical Society was founded\r\nin 1743, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780, and the\r\nNational Academy of Sciences in 1863.\r\n\r\nThe American Association for the Advancement of Science, with its\r\nthousands of members, now has separate sections for each of the special\r\nbranches of science. This great association was organized in 1848, as\r\nthe successor of the Association of American Geologists and Naturalists.\r\nThis was itself a revival of the American Geological Society which first\r\nmet at Yale in 1819. Its meetings have given a great support to the\r\nscientific work of the country.\r\n\r\nThe American Society of Naturalists was founded in 1883. The original\r\nplan of the society was for the discussion of methods of investigation,\r\nadministration and instruction in the natural sciences, but its program\r\nis now entirely devoted to discussions and papers of a broad biological\r\ninterest. It also arranges for an annual dinner of the several\r\nbiological societies and an address on some general biological topic.\r\n\r\nIn 1890, toward the end of the period in which morphological studies\r\nwere being emphasized, the professional zoologists of the eastern states\r\nfounded the American Morphological Society. This association held annual\r\nmeetings during the Christmas holidays for the presentation of\r\nzoological papers. This name became less appropriate after a few years\r\nbecause of the gradual decrease in the proportion of morphological\r\ninvestigations owing to the greater attention being directed to problems\r\nin experimental zoology and physiology. Consequently the name was\r\nchanged to the American Society of Zoologists. To be eligible for\r\nmembership in this society a person must be an active investigator in\r\nsome branch of zoology, as indicated by the published results.\r\n\r\nThe American Association of Anatomists includes in its membership\r\ninvestigators and teachers in comparative anatomy, embryology, and\r\nhistology as well as in human anatomy. Many professional zoologists and\r\nexperimental biologists present their papers before this society, or at\r\nthe meetings of the American Physiological Society. The Entomological\r\nSociety of America and the American Association of Economic\r\nEntomologists are large and active societies.\r\n\r\nThese national societies have been of great service in fostering a high\r\nstandard of zoological research. A still more important service, though\r\ngenerally less conspicuous, is rendered by the journal clubs in\r\nconnection with all the larger zoological laboratories, and by local\r\nscientific societies which are now maintained in all the larger centers\r\nof learning throughout the country. There are also specific societies\r\nfor some of the different fields of biological work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Biological Stations._\r\n\r\nNo insignificant factor in the development of biological science has\r\nbeen the establishment of biological stations where investigators,\r\nteachers and students meet in the Summer vacation for special studies,\r\ndiscussions and research. The most successful of these laboratories have\r\nbeen located on the seashore and here the study of marine life in Summer\r\nsupplements the work of the school or university biological courses. The\r\nfamous Naples Station was founded in 1870, and was shortly after\r\nfollowed by several others. Similar biological stations are now\r\nsupported on almost every coast in Europe and in several inland\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nThe first such American school was established by Louis Agassiz at the\r\nisland of Penikese on the coast of Massachusetts in 1873, succeeding his\r\nprivate laboratory at Nahant. During that Summer more than forty\r\nstudents gained enthusiasm for the work of future years. Unfortunately\r\nthe laboratory so auspiciously started was of brief duration, for the\r\ndeath of Agassiz occurred in December of the same year, and the\r\nlaboratory was discontinued at the end of the following Summer. Shortly\r\nafterward Alexander Agassiz equipped a small private laboratory at\r\nNewport, Rhode Island, and W. K. Brooks established the Chesapeake Bay\r\nZoological Laboratory.\r\n\r\nAt this time the United States Fish Commission was engaged under the\r\ndirection of Spencer F. Baird in a survey of the marine life of the\r\nwaters off the Eastern Coast. Between 1881 and 1886 the Commission\r\nestablished the splendidly equipped biological station at Woods Hole,\r\nMassachusetts. Both here and at the Fish Commission Laboratory at\r\nBeaufort, North Carolina, much work in general zoology as well as in\r\neconomic problems is accomplished. These laboratories are designed\r\nparticularly for specialists engaged in researches connected with the\r\nwork of the Fish Commission.\r\n\r\nA need was soon felt for a marine laboratory along broader lines, and\r\none available to the students and teachers of the schools and colleges.\r\nTo meet these requirements the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory\r\nwas started in 1887, as the successor to an earlier laboratory at\r\nAnnisquam, and has since become a great Summer congress for biologists\r\nfrom all parts of the country. It is safe to say that no other\r\ninstitution has been of equal service in securing for biology the high\r\nplane it now occupies in American science. The leading spirit in the\r\nestablishment of this laboratory and its director for many years was\r\nCharles O. Whitman.\r\n\r\nSuccessful marine laboratories are located also at Cold Spring Harbor,\r\nLong Island; at Harpswell, Maine; and at Bermuda. The Carnegie\r\nInstitution maintains a laboratory at Tortugas Island, Florida, for the\r\ninvestigation of tropical marine life.\r\n\r\nOn the Pacific Coast marine laboratories are located at Pacific Grove\r\nand at La Jolla, California, and at Friday Harbor, Washington. Several\r\nother biological laboratories are open each Summer on our coasts, as\r\nwell as a number of fresh-water laboratories on the interior lakes.\r\nThere are also several mountain laboratories. The influence of these\r\nlaboratories on American biology is immeasurable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Natural History Museums._\r\n\r\nMuseums of Natural History or “Cabinets of Natural Curios” as they were\r\nsometimes called, were established in the first half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury in connection with the various natural history societies. These\r\nwere of much service in stimulating the collection of zoological\r\n“specimens” and in arousing a popular interest in natural history.\r\n\r\nThe zoological museum of earlier days consisted of rows on rows of\r\nsystematically arranged specimens, each carefully labelled with\r\nscientific name, locality, date of collection and donor—much like the\r\npages of a catalogue. All this has now been changed; the bottles of\r\nspecimens have been relegated to the storeroom, and the great plate\r\nglass cases of the modern museum represent individual studies in the\r\nvarious fields of modern zoological research, or individual chapters in\r\nthe latest biological text-books. Often the talent of the artist and the\r\nskill of the taxidermist are cunningly combined to produce most\r\nrealistic bits of nature.\r\n\r\nThe United States National Museum, the American Museum of Natural\r\nHistory, the Field Columbian Museum and the Museum of Comparative\r\nZoology are among the finest museums of the world, while many of the\r\nstates, cities, and universities maintain public museums as a part of\r\ntheir educational systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Systematic Zoology and Taxonomy._\r\n\r\nThe work in systematic zoology is now mainly carried on by specialists\r\nin relatively small groups of animals. This is necessitated both by the\r\nincreasingly large number of species known to science and by the\r\ncompleteness and exactness with which species must now be defined. The\r\nmajority of systematic workers are now connected with museums where the\r\nlarge collections furnish material for comparative studies.\r\n\r\nProminent in this field is the United States National Museum, the\r\npublications of which are mainly taxonomic and zoogeographic, and cover\r\nevery group of organism. The adequacy of this great museum for such\r\nstudies may be illustrated by the collection of mammals. This museum has\r\nthe types of 1135 of the 2138 forms (including species and subspecies)\r\nof North American mammals recognized in Miller’s list,[175] and less\r\nthan 200 forms lack representatives among the 120,000 specimens of\r\nmammals. Systematic monographs of several of the orders of mammals have\r\nbeen published.\r\n\r\nSystematic study of the birds has brought the number of species and\r\nsubspecies known to inhabit North and Middle America to above 3000. The\r\nmost comprehensive systematic treatise is the still incomplete report of\r\nRidgeway[176] of which seven large volumes have already been issued.\r\n\r\nOn the reptiles, the most complete monograph is that by Cope[177]\r\nentitled “The Crocodilians, Lizards and Snakes of North America.”\r\n\r\nThe Amphibia have also been studied by Cope, whose report on the\r\nBatrachia of North America[178] is the standard taxonomic work.\r\n\r\nThe most comprehensive systematic work on fishes is the “Descriptive\r\nCatalogue of the Fishes of North and Middle America” by Jordan and\r\nEvermann.[179]\r\n\r\nThe invertebrate groups have been in part similarly monographed by the\r\nmembers of the U. S. National Museum staff and others, and further\r\nstudies are in progress. Other taxonomic monographs published by this\r\nmuseum include the various groups of animals from many different parts\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nA number of the larger State, municipal, and university museums publish\r\nbulletins on special groups represented in their collections as well as\r\narticles of general zoological interest.\r\n\r\nExpeditions, subsidized by museum and private funds, are from time to\r\ntime sent to various parts of the world and their results are often\r\npublished in sumptuous manner.\r\n\r\nThe total number of living species of animals is unknown, but\r\nconsidering that about a quarter of a million new species have been\r\ndescribed during the past thirty years, it is probable that several\r\nmillion species are in existence to-day. More than half a million have\r\nbeen described. These are probably but a small fraction of the number\r\nthat have existed in past geological ages.\r\n\r\nThus, in spite of all the work that has been done in systematic zoology\r\nand as the number of known species continues to increase, there still\r\nremain many groups of animals, some of which are by no means rare or\r\nminute, in which probably only a small proportion of the species are as\r\nyet capable of identification.\r\n\r\nIt is only since the publication of Ward and Whipple’s “Fresh-water\r\nBiology” within the past year that the amateur zoologist could hope to\r\nfind even the names of all the organisms which may be collected from a\r\nsingle pool of water. And in many cases he will still meet with\r\ndisappointment, for many of our protozoa and other fresh-water organisms\r\nhave not yet been described as species.\r\n\r\nDuring the past few years there has been a tendency on the part of some\r\nof our biologists engaged in experimental work to disparage the studies\r\nof the systematists. It must be granted, however, that both lines of\r\nwork are essential to the sound development of zoological science, for\r\nexperimental investigations in which the accurate diagnosis of species\r\nis ignored always result in confusion.\r\n\r\n_Ecology._—The marvelous modifications in structure and instincts by\r\nwhich the various animals are adapted to their surroundings now forms a\r\nspecial topic in biological research and one of the most fascinating.\r\nThe adaptations in habitat, time, behavior, appearance and even in\r\nstructure are found capable of a certain individual modification when\r\nstudied experimentally.\r\n\r\n_Zoogeography._—Closely associated with systematic zoology, and indeed a\r\npart of the subject in its broader sense, is the study of the\r\ngeographical distribution of animal species and larger groups.\r\n\r\n_Paleontology._—The geological succession of organisms embraces a field\r\nwhere zoologist and geologist meet. The wonderful progress made by\r\nAmerican investigators is well described in the preceding chapters on\r\nHistorical Geology and Vertebrate Paleontology.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Biometry._\r\n\r\nSince Darwin’s theory of evolution postulated the origin of new species\r\nby means of natural selection, it was obviously necessary in order to\r\napply a critical test to determine the precise limits of a species. It\r\nwas, therefore, proposed to subject a given species to a strict\r\nexamination by the application of statistical methods to determine the\r\nrange of variation of its members and the extent to which the species\r\nintergrades with others. Other problems, particularly those concerning\r\nheredity, were treated in similar manner. This branch of biological\r\nscience was particularly developed by the English School, led by Sir\r\nFrancis Galton, followed by Karl Pearson and William Bateson.\r\n\r\nIn America the methods of biometry have been utilized extensively by\r\nCharles B. Davenport, Raymond Pearl, H. S. Jennings and others in the\r\nsolution of problems in genetics and evolution. Their work shows the\r\ngreat value of critical statistical analysis in the interpretation of\r\nbiological data. A thorough training in mathematics is now found to be\r\nhardly less important for the biologist than is a knowledge of physics\r\nand chemistry, for the science of biometry has become one of the most\r\nimportant adjuncts to the study of genetics.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Comparative Anatomy and Embryology._\r\n\r\n_Comparative Anatomy._—Upon the foundations laid down by Cuvier a\r\ncentury ago the present elaborate structure of comparative anatomy of\r\nanimals, both vertebrate and invertebrate, has been developed. Vast as\r\nis the present accumulation of facts and theories many important\r\nproblems still await their solution. Jeffries Wyman was long a leader in\r\nthis field, where many workers are now engaged.\r\n\r\n_Embryology._—The embryological studies, so brilliantly begun by Von\r\nBaer early in the nineteenth century, are still in progress. They have\r\nnow been extended to the groups more difficult of investigation and into\r\nthe earliest stages of fertilization and implantation in the mammals.\r\nArtificial cultural methods have yielded important results. Louis and\r\nAlexander Agassiz, Mark, Minot, Brooks, Whitman, Conklin and E. B.\r\nWilson have taken prominent parts in this work.\r\n\r\nIn the early nineties embryological studies were directed to the\r\narrangement of cells in the dividing egg, and there was much discussion\r\nof “cell lineage” in development. Valuable as were these studies they\r\nthrew comparatively little light on the general problems of evolution.\r\n\r\n_Experimental Embryology._—A more fertile field, developed at the same\r\nperiod and a little later, was found in experimental embryology. The\r\ndiscoveries made by Driesch and others in shaking apart the cells of the\r\ndividing egg or by destroying one or more of these cells gave a new\r\ninsight into the potency of cells for compensatory and regenerative\r\nprocesses. These studies attracted many able investigators, who made\r\nstill further advance by subjecting the germ cells, developing eggs,\r\nembryos, and developing organs to a great variety of artificial\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n_Artificial Parthenogenesis._—Another question concerns the nature of\r\nthe process of fertilization and the agencies which cause the fertilized\r\negg to develop into an embryo. In 1899 Jacques Loeb succeeded in causing\r\ndevelopment in unfertilized sea-urchin eggs by subjecting them to\r\nconcentrated sea water for a period and then returning them to their\r\nnormal environment. To this promising field of experimental work came\r\nmany of the foremost biologists both in America and Europe. It was soon\r\nfound that the eggs of most groups of animals except the higher\r\nvertebrates could be made to develop into more or less perfect embryos\r\nand larval forms by treatment with a great variety of chemical\r\nsubstances, by increased temperature, by mechanical stimuli and by other\r\nmeans. This artificial parthenogenesis, as it is called, has also been\r\nsuccessful in plants (_Fucus_), and recently Loeb has reared several\r\nfrogs to sexual maturity by merely puncturing with a sharp needle the\r\neggs from which they were derived. Loeb, then, maintains that “the egg\r\nis the future embryo and animal; and that the spermatozoon, aside from\r\nits activating effect, only transmits Mendelian characters to the\r\negg.”[180]\r\n\r\nFurther experimental analyses of the nature of the fertilization\r\nmechanism have recently been made by Morgan, Conklin, F. R. Lillie, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n_Germinal Localization._—The question as to whether the egg contains\r\nlocalized organ-forming substances has been studied experimentally\r\nparticularly by means of the centrifuge. The results indicate that\r\nneither of the older opposing theories of “performation” or “epigenesis”\r\nis applicable to all eggs, but that in certain organisms the eggs\r\npossess a well marked differentiation while in others each part of the\r\negg is essentially, although probably not absolutely, equipotential.\r\n\r\n_The Germplasm Cycle._—Since Weismann’s postulation of the independence\r\nof soma and germplasm in 1885 many attempts have been made to trace the\r\npath of the hereditary substance from one generation to the next. A\r\nrecent book by Hegner[181] summarizes the success attained in various\r\ngroups of animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Cytology._\r\n\r\nAnother important field of investigation which has attracted many\r\nworkers is that which pertains to the life of the cell—the science of\r\ncytology. Although the celltheory was established as early as 1839,\r\nlittle advance was made in this subject in America before 1880. Since\r\nthat time, however, Americans have been so successful in cytological\r\ndiscoveries that they are now among the world’s leaders in this field.\r\n\r\nThese studies have been followed along both descriptive and experimental\r\nlines. The most prominent of the early workers in this field are E. L.\r\nMark and E. B. Wilson. Mark’s description of the maturation,\r\nfecundation, and segmentation of the egg is the most accurate and\r\ncomplete of the early cytological studies. Wilson’s discoveries\r\nconcerning the details of fertilization and his “Atlas of Fertilization\r\nand Karyokinesis,” published in 1895, have now become classic. Wilson,\r\ntoo, has published the only American text-book on cytology,[182] and has\r\nmore recently taken the lead in studies concerning the relation between\r\nthe chromosomes and sex. Besides Wilson, Montgomery, Mark, McClung,\r\nMorgan, Miss Stevens, Conklin and their associates and students have now\r\nfurnished conclusive evidence that the sex of an organism is determined\r\nby, or associated with, the nuclear constitution of the fertilized egg.\r\nThis constitution is moreover shown to be dependent upon the chromosomes\r\nreceived from the germ cells.\r\n\r\nThis explanation is in strict accordance with the results of\r\nexperimental breeding. It is also quite in harmony with the Mendelian\r\nlaw of inheritance, and in fact forms one of the strongest supports for\r\nthe view that all Mendelian factors are resident in the chromosomes.\r\nRecent work has also discovered the mechanism which governs the\r\ncomplicated conditions of sex which occur in those animals which exhibit\r\nalternating sexual and parthenogenetic generations. These remarkable\r\nprocesses are in all cases found to depend upon a definite distribution\r\nof the chromosomes.\r\n\r\nOther recent experimental work has shown that while the sex is thus\r\nnormally determined in the fertilized egg, it is in some animals not\r\nirrevocably fixed, and the normal effect of the sex chromosomes may be\r\ninhibited by abnormal conditions in the developing embryo, as is\r\ndemonstrated by the recent work of Lillie and others.\r\n\r\nThe cytological basis for Mendelian inheritance has been very\r\nextensively studied by Morgan and his pupils in connection with their\r\nwork on inheritance in the common fruit fly _Drosophila_. The evidence\r\nsupports Weismann’s earlier hypothesis that the chromosomes are the\r\nbearers of the heritable factors, and that these are arranged in a\r\nseries in the different chromosomes. This theory is shown to be in such\r\nstrict accord with both the cytological studies and the results of\r\nexperimental breeding that Morgan has ventured to indicate definite\r\npoints in particular chromosomes as the loci of definite heritable\r\nfactors, or genes.\r\n\r\nConfirmation of this view is furnished by the behavior of the so-called\r\nsex-linked characters, the genes for which are situated in the same\r\nchromosome as that which carries the sex factor. Many ingenious breeding\r\nexperiments indicate further that all the hereditary characters in\r\n_Drosophila_ are borne in four great linkage groups corresponding with\r\nthe four pairs of chromosomes which the cells of this fly possess.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Comparative Physiology._\r\n\r\nNone of the experimental fields has been of greater importance in\r\nzoological progress than that which concerns the functions of the\r\nvarious organs. Without this companion science morphology and\r\ncomparative anatomy would have become unintelligible. American\r\ninvestigators, among whom G. H. Parker stands prominent, have taken a\r\nleading part in this field also.\r\n\r\n_Neurology._—The physiological analysis of the components of the nervous\r\nsystem, both in vertebrates and invertebrates, is another important\r\nbranch of experimental biology. The 28 volumes of the Journal of\r\nComparative Neurology attest the large influence that American\r\ninvestigators have had in the development of this science.\r\n\r\n_Regeneration._—Experimental studies on the powers of regeneration in\r\nplants and animals have been made from the earliest times. During the\r\npast few years, however, there has been made a concerted attempt to\r\nanalyze the factors which determine the amount and rate of regeneration.\r\nMuch progress has been made toward the postulation of definite laws\r\napplicable to the regenerative processes of the parts of each organism.\r\nThe critical analyses of Morgan, Loeb and Child have been particularly\r\nstimulating.\r\n\r\n_Tissue Culture._—Another line of experimental work which has been\r\ndeveloped within the past few years by Harrison, Carrell, and others is\r\nthe culture of body tissues in artificial media. These experiments have\r\nincluded the cultivation in tubes or on glass slides of the various\r\ntissues of numerous species of animals. They have yielded much\r\ninformation regarding the structure, growth and multiplication of cells,\r\nthe formation of tissues, and the healing of wounds.\r\n\r\n_Transplantation and Grafting._—Closely associated experiments consist\r\nin the transplantation of organs or other portions of the body to\r\nabnormal positions, to the bodies of other animals of the same species\r\nor of other species. In this way much has been learned about the\r\npotentiality of organs for self-differentiation, for regulation, for\r\nregeneration and for compensatory adaptations. The experiments have\r\nshown, further, the independence of soma and germplasm and have revealed\r\nthe nature of certain organs whose functions were previously obscure.\r\n\r\n_Tropisms and Instincts._—Another field of experimental biology concerns\r\nthe analysis of behavior of organisms in response to various forms of\r\nstimuli. These studies are being prosecuted on all groups of organisms,\r\nincluding the larval stages of many animals, and are yielding most\r\nremarkable results. The success in this field of research is largely due\r\nto stimulating influence of Jacques Loeb, Parker, Jennings, and their\r\nco-workers.\r\n\r\n_Biological Chemistry._—Still another experimental field which has\r\ndeveloped into one of the most important of the biological sciences\r\nrelates to the fundamental chemical and physical changes which underlie\r\nall organic phenomena. A knowledge of both physiological and physical\r\nchemistry is to-day essential for all advanced biological work. The\r\npeculiar nature of life itself, of growth, disease, old-age,\r\ndegeneration, death and dissolution are presumably only manifestations\r\nof chemical and physical laws. The ultimate goal of all experimental\r\nbiology, therefore, will be reached only when the basic physico-chemical\r\nproperties of life are understood. At that time only will the perennial\r\ncontroversy between vitalism and mechanism be ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Economic Zoology._\r\n\r\nA moment’s reflection will show that economic biology is the most\r\nessential of all sciences to the human welfare and progress. For man’s\r\nrelation to his environment is such that the penalty for ignorance or\r\nneglect of the biological principles involved in the struggle for\r\nexistence quickly overwhelms him with a horde of parasites or other\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nIt is only by the intelligent application of biological knowledge that\r\nour food supplies, our forests, our domesticated animals and our bodies\r\ncan be protected from the ever ravenous organisms which surround us.\r\n\r\nThe losses to food supplies and other products by insects alone amounts\r\nto 100 millions of dollars a month in the United States. And the\r\nparasites cause losses in sickness and premature deaths each year of\r\nmany millions more. Then there are the destructive rodents and other\r\nanimals which add largely to our burdens of support. These enemies next\r\nto wars and fungi are the most destructive agencies on earth. Could they\r\nbut be eliminated man’s struggle against opposing forces would be in\r\nlarge measure overcome. The results of recent work in economic zoology,\r\nboth in regard to the destruction of enemies and protection of useful\r\nmammals, birds and fishes, furnish a bright outlook for the future.\r\n\r\n_Protozoology._—Partly as an experimental field for the solution of\r\ngeneral biological problems and partly because of its practical\r\napplications the study of protozoa has now developed into a special\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe results of the investigations of Calkins, Woodruff, Jennings and\r\nothers have greatly supplemented our understanding of the signification\r\nof such important biological phenomena as reproduction, sexual\r\ndifferentiation, conjugation, tropisms, and metabolism.\r\n\r\nFrom an economic standpoint the protozoa have recently been shown to be\r\nof the greatest importance because of the human and animal diseases for\r\nwhich they are responsible.\r\n\r\n_Parasitology._—The animal parasites of man, domesticated animals and\r\nplants include numerous species of protozoa, worms, and insects.\r\nTogether with the bacteria and a few higher fungi they cause all\r\ncommunicable diseases. When we consider that not only our health but\r\nalso our entire food supply is dependent upon the elimination of these\r\norganisms we must admit that parasitology is the most important\r\neconomically of all the sciences.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the investigations of Stiles and his associates in the\r\nHygienic Laboratory and of Ransom and his staff in the Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry are widely distributed by the federal government. The\r\nsystematic studies so ably begun by Joseph Leidy in the middle of the\r\nlast century have been continued by Ward, Linton, Pratt, Curtis and\r\nothers on the parasites of many groups of animals.\r\n\r\n_Economic Entomology._—Another extremely important biological science,\r\nthe practical applications of which are second only to those of\r\nparasitology in importance, is entomology. In the last few years\r\neconomic entomology has exceeded any of the other branches of biology in\r\nthe number of its investigators. The American Association of Economic\r\nEntomologists has a membership of about five hundred. The work of most\r\nof these is supported by appropriations from the State and federal\r\ngovernments, and the results of their investigations are widely\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nIt is now well known that some of the protozoon parasites are conveyed\r\nfrom man to man only through the bites of insects. The local eradication\r\nof several of our most fatal diseases has recently been brought about by\r\nthe application of measures to destroy such insects. This is the\r\ngreatest triumph of economic zoology.\r\n\r\n_Economic Ichthyology._—The U. S. Fish Commission has for many years\r\nbeen actively engaged in investigations on the food fishes, including\r\nmethods for increasing the food supply by suitable protection and\r\nartificial propagation. The work includes also edible and otherwise\r\nuseful mollusks and crustacea. Their marine and fresh-water laboratories\r\nhave also been of great service to general biological science.\r\n\r\n_Economic Ornithology and Mammalogy._—In addition to the local bird\r\nclubs and the American Ornithologists Union for the study and\r\npreservation of bird and mammal life, the Bureau of Biological Survey\r\nhas for some years conducted investigations on the economic importance\r\nof the various species. The publications of this Bureau are of great\r\nvalue both in determining the economic status of our birds and mammals,\r\nand also in recommending means for the protection of the beneficial\r\nspecies and the destruction of the injurious. Several of the States\r\nissue similar publications.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Genetics._\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting chapters in biology relates to the\r\ndevelopment of the modern science of heredity, or genetics.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the year 1900, when the Mendelian principle of inheritance\r\nwas re-discovered, the relative importance of heredity and of\r\nenvironment in the development of an organism was little understood. It\r\nis true that Weismann had insisted on the independence of soma and\r\ngermplasm some years earlier (1883), but the body of the individual was\r\nstill generally considered the key to its inheritance.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the general application of Mendel’s discovery gave a\r\ngreat impetus to experimental breeding both in plants and animals. While\r\nheretofore it had been necessary to depend upon the somatic characters\r\nas evidence of the hereditary constitution of an individual, it now\r\nbecame possible, knowing the hereditary constitution of the parents of\r\nany pair of individuals, to predict with almost mathematical certainty\r\nthe characters of their possible offspring.\r\n\r\nIn general, the laws of possible chance combinations of any group of\r\ncharacters determine the probability of any particular offspring\r\npossessing one or many of those characters. The physical basis for such\r\nMendelian inheritance is evidently the chance combinations of\r\nchromosomes which result from the processes of maturation and union of\r\nthe germ cells.\r\n\r\nCertain limitations to the law are met with because the relatively small\r\nnumber of chromosomes involves linkage of genes, because of the\r\noccasional interchange of groups of genes between homologous\r\nchromosomes, and because the relative activity or potency of any\r\nparticular gene may differ in different races, and, finally, because the\r\nnormal activity of any given gene may be modified or inhibited by the\r\naction of other genes. It is by no means certain, however, that all\r\ninheritance is Mendelian, for there still remains much evidence that the\r\nhereditary basis of certain characters may be resident in the cytoplasm,\r\nrather than in the chromosomes. A recent book by Morgan, Sturtevant,\r\nMüller and Bridges (1915), entitled “the mechanism of Mendelian\r\nheredity” gives the cytological explanation of Mendelian inheritance.\r\n\r\nAmericans have from the first taken a leading part in this field of\r\nresearch and have been quick to recognize its practical applications to\r\nthe improvement of breeds in both animals and plants. This prominent\r\nposition is largely due to the experimental work of Castle, Davenport,\r\nMorgan, Jennings, Pearl, and their co-workers on animals and that of\r\nEast, Emerson, Davis, Hayes and Shull on plants.\r\n\r\nThe geneticist now realizes that the appearance of the body (phenotype)\r\ngives but little clue to the inheritance (genotype). That two white\r\nflowers produce only purple offspring, or two white fowls only deeply\r\ncolored chickens, or that a pair of guinea pigs, one of which is black\r\nand the other white, have only gray agouti offspring, while other\r\napparently similar white flowers or white animals produce offspring like\r\nthemselves, is now readily comprehensible and mathematically\r\npredictable.\r\n\r\nThe most important application of our newly acquired knowledge of\r\ninheritance is in the improvement of the human race. The wonderful\r\nopportunity in this direction must be apparent to all. The welfare of\r\nhumanity depends upon the immediate adoption of eugenic principles. The\r\nEugenics Record Office has secured many of the essential data.\r\n\r\nWith the destruction of the world’s best germ plasm at a rate never\r\nequalled before, the outlook for the future race would be appalling were\r\nit not for the hope that with the advent of a righteous peace will come\r\na realization of the necessity of applying these new biological\r\ndiscoveries to improving the races of men. That the discoveries have\r\nbeen made too late in the world’s history to be of such use to humanity\r\nmust not be thought possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Evolution._\r\n\r\nPrevious to the publication of Darwin’s “Origin of Species” in 1859,\r\nAmerican zoologists were generally inclined toward special creation, in\r\nspite of the evidences for evolution which had been presented by Erasmus\r\nDarwin, Buffon, Lamarck, and Geoffroy St.-Hilaire. This attitude of mind\r\ncontinued for some years after the publication of the natural selection\r\ntheory of Darwin and Wallace. This was in part due to the powerful\r\ninfluence of Louis Agassiz and others who bitterly opposed the Darwinian\r\ntheory. The influence of Asa Gray in gaining a general acceptance for\r\nthis theory is explained in the following chapter.\r\n\r\nA modified Lamarckian doctrine was widely accepted in the last quarter\r\nof the century, due largely to the influence of Cope, Hyatt and Packard.\r\nThe inheritance of “acquired characters” demanded by this theory seems\r\nincompatible with the discoveries of recent times, so that “to-day the\r\ntheory has few followers amongst trained investigators, but it still has\r\na popular vogue that is wide-spread and vociferous.”[183]\r\n\r\nThe origin of new varieties and species by accidental and fortuitous\r\nmodifications (mutations) of the germplasm is now the most widely\r\naccepted theory of evolution.\r\n\r\nSome of the most important discoveries regarding the origin of new forms\r\nhave been recently made by Morgan and his pupils. From a stock of the\r\ncommon fruit fly (_Drosophila ampelophila_) more than 125 new types have\r\narisen within six years. Each of these types breeds true. “Each has\r\narisen independently and suddenly. Every part of the body has been\r\naffected by one or another of these mutations.” To arrange these\r\nmutations arbitrarily into graded series would give the impression of an\r\nevolutionary series, but this is directly contrary to the known facts\r\nconcerning their origin, for each mutation “originated independently\r\nfrom the wild type.” “Evolution has taken place by the incorporation\r\ninto the race of those mutations that are beneficial to the life and\r\nreproduction of the individual.” This evolutionary process is usually\r\naccompanied by the elimination of those forms which have remained stable\r\nor which have developed adverse mutations.\r\n\r\nA question that is being vigorously debated at this time concerns the\r\npossible effects of selection on the hereditary factors. Are the genes\r\nfixed both qualitatively and quantitatively or does a given gene vary in\r\npotency under different conditions and in different individuals? In the\r\nformer case selection can only separate the existing genes into separate\r\npure strains. But if the gene be quantitatively variable, then selection\r\nwill result in the establishment of new types.\r\n\r\nCastle has long stoutly maintained the effect of such selection, and his\r\nforces have recently been augmented by Jennings. The experimental work\r\nnow in process will doubtless yield a decisive answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Conclusion._\r\n\r\nA comparison of the simple descriptive natural history of a century ago\r\nwith the foregoing manifold developments of modern biology will indicate\r\nthe wonderful progress which has occurred during this period. The path\r\nhas led from the crude methods of the almost unaided eye and hand to the\r\napplications of the most delicate experimental apparatus. For the\r\nmarvelous success which zoology has attained has been possible only by\r\nthe skillful use of scalpel, microscope, microtome and other mechanical\r\ndevices and by the refined methods of the chemist and physicist.\r\n\r\nThe central truth to which all these discoveries consistently point is\r\nthe unity and harmony of all biological phenomena, and indeed of all\r\nnature. No longer does the zoologist find any demarcated line separating\r\nhis field of research from that of the botanist or the chemist or even\r\nof the physicist, for all the natural sciences obviously deal with\r\nclosely associated phenomena. The aim of the future will be both to\r\ncomplete fields of study already marked out and to derive a\r\ncomprehensive explanation of the general principles involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _Notes._\r\n\r\nFootnote 172:\r\n\r\n  Proc.

GOODALE\r\n\r\n\r\n  “_Our Botany, it is true, has been extensively and successfully\r\n  investigated, but this field is still rich, and rewards every new\r\n  research with some interesting discovery._”\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch are the words with which the sagacious and far-sighted founder of\r\nthe American Journal of Science and Arts, in his general introduction to\r\nthe first volume, alludes to the study of plants. It is plain that the\r\neditor, embarking on this new enterprise, appreciated the attractions of\r\nthis inviting field and sympathetically recognized the good work which\r\nwas being done in it. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that he\r\nwelcomed to the pages of his initial number contributions to botany.\r\n\r\n_Early Botanical Works._—The collections of dried and living North\r\nAmerican plants, which had been carried from time to time to botanists\r\nin Europe, had been eagerly studied, and the results had been published\r\nin accessible treatises. Besides these general treatises, there had been\r\nissued certain works, wholly devoted to the American Flora. Among these\r\nlatter may be mentioned Pursh’s “Flora” (1814) and Nuttall’s “Genera”\r\n(1818). There were also a few works which were rather popular in their\r\ncharacter, such as Amos Eaton’s “Manual of Botany for North America”\r\n(1817), and Bigelow’s “Collection of the Plants of Boston and environs”\r\n(1814). These handbooks were convenient, and possessed the charm of not\r\nbeing exhaustive; consequently a botanist, whether professional or\r\namateur, was stimulated to feel that he had a good chance of enriching\r\nthe list of species and adding to the next edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n              _The Early Years of Botany in the Journal._\r\n\r\nAt that time, the botanists had no journal in this country devoted to\r\ntheir science. Here and there they found opportunity for publishing\r\ntheir discoveries in some medical periodical or in a local newspaper.\r\nHence American botanists availed themselves of the welcome extended by\r\nSilliman to botanical contributors to place their results on record in a\r\nmagazine devoted to science in its wide sense. Specialization and\r\nsubdivision of science had not then begun to dissociate allied subjects,\r\nand, consequently, botanists felt that they would be at home in this\r\njournal conducted by a chemist. Botanists responded promptly to this\r\ninvitation with interesting contributions.\r\n\r\nIt is well to remember that the appliances at the command of naturalists\r\nat the date when the Journal began its service, were imperfect and\r\ninadequate. The botanist did not possess a convenient achromatic\r\nmicroscope, and he was not in possession of the chemical aids now deemed\r\nnecessary in even the simplest research. Hence, attention was given\r\nalmost wholly to such matters as the forms of plants and the more\r\nobvious phenomena of plant-life. In view of the poverty of instrumental\r\naids in research, the results attained must be regarded as surprising.\r\n\r\nIn the very first volume of the Journal, bearing the date of 1818, there\r\nare descriptions of four new genera and of four new species of plants;\r\ncertainly a large share to give to systematic botany. Besides these\r\narticles, there are some instructive notes concerning a few plants,\r\nwhich up to that time had been imperfectly understood. There are four\r\nFloral Calendars which give details in regard to the blossoming and the\r\nfruiting of plants in limited districts, a botanical subject of some\r\nimportance but likely to become tedious in the long run. Just here, the\r\nskill of the editor in limiting undesirable contributions is shown by\r\nhis tactful remark designed to soothe the feelings of a prolix writer\r\nwhose too long list of plants in a floral calendar he had editorially\r\ncut down to reasonable limits. The editor remarks, “such extended\r\nobservations are desirable, but it may not always be convenient to\r\ninsert very voluminous details of daily floral occurrence.” It is\r\nconvenient to consider by themselves some of the botanical contributions\r\npublished in the first series of volumes of the Journal during a period\r\nof twenty years, the period before Asa Gray became actively and\r\nconstantly associated with the Journal.\r\n\r\nIn systematic and geographical botany one finds communications from\r\nDouglass and Torrey (=4=, 56, 1822) on the plants of what was then the\r\nNorthwest; Lewis C. Beck (=10=, 257, 1826; =11=, 167, 1826; =14=, 112,\r\n1828) contributed valuable papers on the botany of Illinois and\r\nMissouri; there is a literal translation by Dr. Ruschenberger (=19=, 63,\r\n299, 1831; =20=, 248, 1831; =23=, 78, 250, 1833) of a very long list of\r\nthe plants of Chili; Wolle and Huebener (=37=, 310, 1839) gave an\r\nannotated catalogue of botanical specimens collected in Pennsylvania;\r\nTuckerman (=45=, 27, 1843) presented communications in regard to\r\nnumerous species which he had examined critically; Darlington (=41=,\r\n365, 1841) published his lecture on grasses; Asa Gray (=40=, 1, 1841)\r\ngave an instructive account of European herbaria visited by him, and he\r\ncontributed also a charming account (=42=, 1, 1842) of a botanical\r\njourney to the mountains of North Carolina. The most extensive series of\r\nbotanical communication at this time was the Caricography by Professor\r\nDewey of Williams College, presented in many numbers of the Journal; the\r\nfirst of these in =7=, pp. 264–278, 1824. There were also descriptions\r\nof certain new genera, and species, and critical studies in synonyms.\r\n\r\nCryptogamic botany is represented in the first series of volumes of the\r\nJournal by L. C. Beck’s (=15=, 287, 1829) study of ferns and mosses, by\r\nBailey’s (=35=, 113, 1839) histology of the vascular system of ferns, by\r\nFries’ Systema mycologicum (=12=, 235, 1829), and by De Schweinitz (=9=,\r\n397, 1825) and Halsey, who had in hand a cryptogamic manual. There are\r\ntwo important papers by Alexander Braun, translated by Dr. George\r\nEngelmann, one on the Equisetaceæ of North America (=46=, 81, 1844) and\r\nthe other on the Characeæ (=46=, 92, 1844).\r\n\r\nVegetable paleontology had begun to attract attention in many places in\r\nthis country, and therefore the translated contributions by Brongniart\r\non fossil plants were given space in the Journal. Plant-physiology\r\nreceived a good share of attention either in short notices or in longer\r\narticles. Such titles appear as, the respiration of plants, the\r\ncirculation of sap, the excrementitious matter thrown off by plants, the\r\neffects of certain gases and poisons on plants, and the relations of\r\nplants to different colored light. One of the most important of the\r\nnotes is that in which is described the discovery by Robert Brown (=19=,\r\n393, 1831) of the constant movement of minute particles suspended in a\r\nliquid, first detected by him in the fovilla of pollen grains, and now\r\nknown as the Brownian (or Brunonian) movement. The heading under which\r\nthis note appears is of interest, “The motion of living particles in all\r\nkinds of matter.”\r\n\r\nOne side of botany touches agriculture and economics. That side was\r\nrepresented even in the first volume of the Journal by a study of “the\r\ncomparative quantity of nutritious matter which may be obtained from an\r\nacre of land when cultivated with potatoes or wheat.” Succeeding volumes\r\nin this series likewise present phases which are of special interest\r\nregarded from the point of view of economics; for example, those which\r\ntreat of rotation of crops and of enriching the soil. Probably the\r\neconomic paper which may be regarded as the most important, in fact\r\nepoch-making, is the full account of the invention by Appert of a method\r\nfor preserving food indefinitely (=13=, 163, 1828). We all know that\r\nAppert’s process has revolutionized the preservation of foods, and in\r\nits modern modification underlies the vast industry of canned fruits,\r\nvegetables and so on. There are suggestions, also, as to the utilization\r\nof new foods, or of old foods in a new way, which resemble the\r\nsuggestions made in these days of food conservation. For example, it is\r\nshown that flour can be made from leguminous seeds by steaming and\r\nsubsequent drying, and pulverizing. There are excellent hints as to the\r\nbest ways of preparing and using potatoes, and also for preserving them\r\nunderground, where they will remain good for a year or two. It is shown\r\nthat potato flour can be made into excellent bread. Another method of\r\nmaking bread, namely from wood, is described, but it does not seem quite\r\nso practicable. There are interesting notes on the sugar-beet as a\r\nsource of sugar, and here appears one of the earliest accounts of the\r\nAssam tea-plant, which was destined to revolutionize the tea industry\r\nthroughout the world. Cordage and textile fibers of bark and of wood\r\nshould be utilized in the manufacture of paper. In fact one comes upon\r\nmany such surprises in economic botany as the earlier volumes of the\r\nJournal are carefully examined.\r\n\r\nEarly numbers of the Journal present with sufficient fullness accounts\r\nof the remarkable discovery by Daguerre and others of a process for\r\ntaking pictures by light, on a silver plate or upon paper (=37=, 374,\r\n1839; =38=, 97, 1840, etc.). Before many years passed, the Journal had\r\noccasion to show that these novel photographic delineations could be\r\nmade useful in the investigation of problems in botany. In the pages of\r\nthe Journal it would be easily possible to trace the development of this\r\nart in its relations to natural history. Silliman possessed great\r\nsagacity in selecting for his enterprise all the novelties which\r\npromised to be of service in the advancement of science. In 1825 (=9=,\r\n263) the Journal republished from the Edinburgh Journal of Science an\r\nessay by Dr. (afterwards Sir) William Jackson Hooker, on American\r\nBotany. In this essay the author states that “the various scientific\r\nJournals” which “are published in America, contain many memoirs upon the\r\nindigenous plants. Among the first of these in point of value, and we\r\nthink also the first with regard to time, we must name Silliman’s\r\nJournal of Science.” The author enumerates some of the contributors to\r\nthe Journal and the titles of their papers.\r\n\r\nIt has been a useful practice of the Journal, almost from the first, to\r\ntransfer to its pages memoirs which would otherwise be likely to escape\r\nthe notice of the majority of American botanists. The book notices and\r\nthe longer book reviews covered so wide a field that they placed the\r\nreaders of the Journal in touch with nearly all of the current botanical\r\nliterature both here and abroad. These critical notices did much towards\r\nthe symmetrical development of botany in the United States. And as we\r\nshall now see, the Journal notices and reviews in the hands of Asa Gray\r\ncontinued to be one of the most important factors in the advancement of\r\nAmerican botany.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Asa Gray and the Journal._\r\n\r\nIn 1834 there appears in the Journal (=25=, 346) a “Sketch of the\r\nMineralogy of a portion of Jefferson and St. Lawrence Counties, New\r\nYork, by J. B. Crawe of Watertown and A. Gray of Utica, New York.” This\r\nappears to be the first mention in the Journal of the name of Dr. Asa\r\nGray, who, shortly after that date, became thoroughly identified with\r\nits botanical interests. In the early part of his career both before and\r\nimmediately after graduating in medicine, Gray gave much attention to\r\nthe different branches of natural history in its wide sense. He not only\r\nstudied but taught “chemistry, geology, mineralogy, and botany,” the\r\nlatter branch being the one to which he devoted most of his attention.\r\nAmong his early guides in the pursuit of botany may be mentioned Dr.\r\nHadley, “who had learned some botany from Dr. Ives of New Haven,” and\r\nDr. Lewis C. Beck of Albany, author of Botany of the United States North\r\nof Virginia. At that period he made the acquaintance of Dr. John Torrey\r\nof New York, with whom he later became associated in most important\r\ndescriptive work. During the years between his graduation in medicine\r\nand 1842, the year when he came to Harvard College, his activities were\r\ndiverse and intense; so that his preparation for his distinguished\r\ncareer was very broad and thorough. His first visit to Europe, in 1838,\r\nbrought him into personal relations with a large number of the botanists\r\nof Great Britain and the Continent. This extensive acquaintance, added\r\nto his broad training, enabled him even from the outset to exert a\r\nprofound influence upon the progress of his favorite science. He made\r\nthe Journal tributary to this development. His name first appears as\r\nassociate editor in 1853, but there are articles in the Journal from his\r\npen which bear an earlier date. The first of these early botanical\r\npapers is the following: “A Translation of a memoir entitled ‘Beiträge\r\nzur Lehre von der Befruchtung der Pflanzen,’ (contributions to the\r\ndoctrine of the impregnation of plants, by A. J. C. Corda:) with\r\nprefatory remarks on the progress of discovery relative to vegetable\r\nfecundation; by Asa Gray, M. D.” (=31=, 308, 1837). Dr. Gray says that\r\nhe made the translation from the German for his own private use, but\r\nthinking that it might be interesting to the Lyceum, he brought it\r\nbefore the Society, with “a cursory account of the progress of discovery\r\nrespecting the fecundation of flowering plants, for the purpose of\r\nrendering the memoir more generally intelligible to those who are not\r\nparticularly conversant with the present state of botanical science.”\r\nThe translation occupies six pages of the Journal, while the prefatory\r\nremarks fill nine pages. The prefatory remarks constitute an exhaustive\r\nessay on the subject, embodied in attractive and perfectly clear\r\nlanguage. The translator shows complete familiarity with the matter in\r\nhand and gives an adequate account of all the work done on the subject\r\nup to the date of M. Corda’s paper. A second important paper by him near\r\nthis period is his review of “A Natural System of Botany: or a\r\nsystematic view of the Organization, Natural Affinities, and\r\nGeographical Distribution of the whole Vegetable Kingdom; together with\r\nthe use of the more important species in Medicine, the Arts, and rural\r\nand domestic economy, by John Lindley. Second edition, with numerous\r\nadditions and corrections, and a complete list of genera and their\r\nsynonyms. London: 1836” (=32=, 292, 1837). A very brief notice of this\r\nwork in the first part of the volume for 1837 closes with the words, “A\r\nmore extended notice of the work may be expected in the ensuing number\r\nof the Journal.” The extended notice proved to be a critical study of\r\nthe work, signed by the initials A. G. which later became so familiar to\r\nreaders of the Journal. Citation of a few of its sentences will indicate\r\nthe strong and quiet manner in which Dr. Gray, even at the outset, wrote\r\nhis notices of books. In speaking of the second edition of Professor\r\nLindley’s work, he says:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sincerely yours Asa Gray]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “It is not necessary to state that a treatise of this kind was greatly\r\n  needed, or to allude to the peculiar qualifications of the learned and\r\n  industrious author for the accomplishment of the task, or the high\r\n  estimation in which the work is held in Europe. But we may properly\r\n  offer our testimony respecting the great and favorable influence which\r\n  it has exerted upon the progress of botanical science in the United\r\n  States. Great as the merits of the work undoubtedly are, we must\r\n  nevertheless be excused from adopting the terms of extravagant and\r\n  sometimes equivocal eulogy employed by a popular author, who gravely\r\n  informs his readers that no book, since printed Bibles were first sold\r\n  in Paris by Dr. Faustus, ever excited so much surprise and wonder as\r\n  did Dr. Torrey’s edition of Lindley’s Introduction to the Natural\r\n  System of Botany. Now we can hardly believe that either the author or\r\n  the American editor of the work referred to was ever in danger, as was\r\n  honest Dr. Faustus, of being burned for witchcraft, neither do we find\r\n  anything in its pages calculated to produce such astonishing effects,\r\n  except, perhaps, upon the minds of those botanists, if such they may\r\n  be called, who had never dreamed of any important changes in the\r\n  science since the appearance of good Dr. Turton’s translation of the\r\n  Species Plantarum, and who speak of Jussieu as a writer who has\r\n  greatly improved the natural orders of Linnæus.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Journal for 1840 there is a large group of unsigned book reviews\r\nunder the heading, “Brief notices of recent Botanical works, especially\r\nthose most interesting to the student of North American Botany.” The\r\nfirst of these short reviews deals with the second section of Part VII\r\nof De Candolle’s “Prodromus.” In 1847 the consideration of the\r\n“Prodromus” is resumed by the same author and the initials of A. G. are\r\nappended. This indicates that Dr. Gray was probably the writer of some\r\nof the unsigned book reviews which had appeared in the Journal between\r\n1837 and 1840. Doubtless Silliman availed himself of the assistance of\r\nhis associates, Eli Ives and others, in New Haven, in the examination of\r\ncurrent botanical literature, and it is extremely probable that he early\r\nsecured help from young Dr. Gray, who had shown himself to be a keen\r\ncritic as well as a pleasing writer. The notices of botanical works from\r\n1840 bear marks of having been from the same hand. They cover an\r\nextremely wide range of subjects. While they are good-tempered they are\r\ncritical, and they had much to do with the development of botany, in\r\nthis country, along safe lines.\r\n\r\n_Gray as Editor._—Gray’s name as associate editor of the Journal appears\r\nin 1853. He had been a welcome contributor, as we have seen, for many\r\nyears. His influence upon the progress of botany in the United States\r\nwas largely due to his connection with the Journal. His reviews extended\r\nover a very wide range, and supplemented to a remarkable degree his\r\nother educational work. It must be permitted to allude here to his\r\nsagacity as a writer of educational treatises. In his first elementary\r\ntext-book, published in 1836, he expressed wholly original views in\r\nregard to certain phases of structure and function in plants, which\r\nbecame generally adopted at a later date. His Manual of Botany was\r\nconstructed, and subsequent editions were kept, on a plan which made no\r\nappeal to those who wanted to work on lines of least resistance; in fact\r\nhe had no patience with those who desired merely to ascertain the name\r\nof a plant. In the Journal he emphasizes the desirability of learning\r\nall the affinities of the plant under consideration. At a later period,\r\nwhen entirely new chapters had been opened in the life of plants, he\r\nsought by his contributions in the Journal to interest students in this\r\nwider outlook.\r\n\r\nProfessor C. S. Sargent has selected with good judgment some of the more\r\nimportant scientific papers by Professor Gray and has republished them\r\nin a convenient form.[184] Many of these papers were contributed to the\r\nJournal in the form of reviews. These reviews touch nearly every branch\r\nof the science of botany. As Sargent justly says, “Many of the reviews\r\nare filled with original and suggestive observations, and taken\r\ntogether, furnish the best account of the development of botanical\r\nliterature during the last fifty years that has yet been written.” In\r\nthese longer reviews in the Journal, Gray was wont to take a book under\r\nreview as affording an opportunity to illustrate some important subject,\r\nand many of the reviews are crowded with his expositions. For example,\r\nin his examination of vonMohl’s “Vegetable Cell” (=15=, 451, 1853) he\r\ntakes up the whole subject of microscopic structure, so far as it was\r\nthen understood, and he points out the probable errors of some of Mohl’s\r\ncontemporaries, showing what and how great were Mohl’s own contributions\r\nto histology. Such a review is a landmark in the science. The physiology\r\nof the cell and the nutrition of the plant were favorite topics with\r\nProfessor Gray, and he brought much of his knowledge in regard to them\r\ninto such a review as that of Boussingault (=25=, 120, 1858) on the\r\n“Influence of nitrates on the production of vegetable matter.”\r\n\r\nAs a systematic botanist, Gray was naturally much interested in the\r\nvexed question of nomenclature of plants. One of his most important\r\ncommunications to the Journal is his review, in the volume for 1883\r\n(=26=, 417), of DeCandolle’s work on the subject. He deals with this\r\nstrictly technical matter much as he did in a contribution to the\r\nJournal which he made in 1868 (=46=, 63). In both of these papers he\r\nstates with clearness the general features of the code of nomenclature.\r\nHe says explicitly that the code does not make, but rather declares, the\r\ncommon law of botanists. The treatment of the subject at his hands would\r\nrightly impress a general reader as showing a strong desire to have\r\ncommon sense applied to doubtful cases, instead of insisting on\r\ninflexible rules. For this reason, his rule of practice was not always\r\nacceptable to those who were anxious to secure conformity to arbitrary\r\nrules at whatever cost. As he said in a paper published in the Journal\r\nin 1847 (=3=, 302), “The difficulty of a reform increases with its\r\nnecessity. It is much easier to state the evils than to relieve them;\r\nand the well-meant endeavors that have recently been made to this end,\r\nare, some of them, likely, if adopted, to make confusion worse\r\nconfounded.” This feeling led him to be very conservative in the matter\r\nof reform in nomenclature.\r\n\r\nThis subject of botanical nomenclature illustrates a method frequently\r\nemployed by Professor Gray to elucidate a difficult matter. He would\r\nfind in the treatise under review a text, or texts, on which he would\r\nbuild a treatise of his own, and in this way he made clear his own views\r\nrelative to most of the important phases of botany. When he faced\r\ncontroverted matters, his attitude still remained judicial. While he was\r\ntolerant of opinions which clashed with his own, he was always severe\r\nupon charlatanism and impatient of inaccuracy. The pages of the Journal\r\ncontain many severe criticisms at his hands, but an unprejudiced person\r\nwould say that the severity is merited.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, instead of reviewing a book or an address, he would\r\nfollow the custom inaugurated early in the history of the Journal, of\r\nmaking copious extracts, and thus give to its readers an opportunity of\r\nexamining materials which otherwise might not fall in their way.\r\n\r\nGray’s contributions to the Journal comprise more than one thousand\r\ntitles, without counting the memorial notices and the shorter obituary\r\nnotes. In these notices he sums up in a few well-chosen words the\r\ncontributions made to botany by his contemporaries. Even in the few\r\ninstances in which he felt obliged to note with disapproval some of the\r\nwork, he expressed himself with personal friendliness. The necrology, as\r\nit appeared from month to month, was a labor of love. All of the longer\r\nmemorial notices are what it is the fashion now-a-days to call\r\nappreciations, and these are so happily phrased that it would seem as if\r\nthe writer in many a case asked himself, “Would my friend, about whom I\r\nam now writing, make any change in this sketch?”\r\n\r\n_Gray on Darwinism._—In October, 1859, Darwin’s epoch-making work, “The\r\nOrigin of Species,” was published. An early copy was sent to the editor\r\nof the Journal, Professor James D. Dana. This arrived in New Haven on\r\nDecember 21, but it was preceded by a personal letter which is of so\r\nmuch interest that it is here transcribed in full. It should be added\r\nthat Dana was at this time in Europe where he was spending a year in the\r\nsearch for health after a serious nervous breakdown. In his absence the\r\nbook was noticed by Gray as stated below. The letter is, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            Down, Bromley, Kent.\r\n                                                        Nov. 11th, 1859.\r\n\r\n  My dear Sir,\r\n\r\n  I have sent you a copy of my Book (as yet only an abstract) on the\r\n  Origin of Species. I know too well that the conclusion, at which I\r\n  have arrived, will horrify you, but you will, I believe and hope, give\r\n  me credit for at least an honest search after the truth. I hope that\r\n  you will read my Book, straight through; otherwise from the great\r\n  condensation it will be unintelligible. Do not, I pray, think me so\r\n  presumptuous as to hope to convert you; but if you can spare time to\r\n  read it with care, and will then do what is far more important, keep\r\n  the subject under my point of view for some little time occasionally\r\n  before your mind, I have hopes that you will agree that more can be\r\n  said in favour of the mutability of species, than is at first\r\n  apparent. It took me many long years before I wholly gave up the\r\n  common view of the separate creation of each species. Believe me, with\r\n  sincere respect and with cordial thanks for the many acts of\r\n  scientific kindness which I have received from you,\r\n\r\n                                                     My dear Sir,\r\n                                                 Yours very sincerely,\r\n                                                         CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn March, 1860 (=29=, 153), Gray published in the Journal an elaborate\r\nand cautious review of Darwin’s work. He alluded to the absence of the\r\nchief editor of the Journal in the following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The duty of reviewing this volume in the American Journal of Science\r\n  would naturally devolve upon the principal editor whose wide\r\n  observation and profound knowledge of various departments of natural\r\n  history, as well as of geology, particularly qualify him for the task.\r\n  But he has been obliged to lay aside his pen to seek in distant lands\r\n  the entire repose from scientific labor so essential to the\r\n  restoration of his health, a consummation devoutly to be wished and\r\n  confidently to be expected. Interested as Mr. Dana would be in this\r\n  volume, he could not be expected to accept its doctrine. Views so\r\n  idealistic as those upon which his ‘Thoughts upon Species’ are\r\n  grounded, will not harmonize readily with a doctrine so thoroughly\r\n  naturalistic as that of Mr. Darwin.... Between the doctrines of this\r\n  volume and those of the great naturalist whose name adorns the title\r\n  page of this Journal [Mr. Agassiz] the widest divergence appears.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGray then proceeds to contrast the two views of Darwin and Agassiz, “for\r\nthis contrast brings out most prominently and sets in strongest light\r\nand shade the main features of the theory of the origination of species\r\nby means of Natural Selection.” He then states both sides with great\r\nfairness, and proceeds:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Who shall decide between such extreme views so ably maintained on\r\n  either hand, and say how much truth there may be in each. The present\r\n  reviewer has not the presumption to undertake such a task. Having no\r\n  prepossession in favor of naturalistic theories, but struck with the\r\n  eminent ability of Mr. Darwin’s work, and charmed with its fairness,\r\n  our humbler duty will be performed if, laying aside prejudice as much\r\n  as we can, we shall succeed in giving a fair account of its method and\r\n  argument, offering by the way a few suggestions such as might occur to\r\n  any naturalist of an inquiring mind. An editorial character for this\r\n  article must in justice be disclaimed. The plural pronoun is employed\r\n  not to give editorial weight, but to avoid even the appearance of\r\n  egotism and also the circumlocution which attends a rigorous adherence\r\n  to the impersonal style.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this review he moves slowly and thoughtfully, but not timidly, over\r\nthe new paths. There is no clear indication in the review that he has\r\nyet made up his mind as to the validity of Darwin’s hypothesis. But, in\r\na second article appearing in the Journal for September of the same year\r\n(=30=, 226), under the title “Discussion between two readers of Darwin’s\r\ntreatise on the origin of species upon its natural theology” Gray\r\nplainly begins to incline to take a very favorable view of the Darwinian\r\ntheory, and makes use of the following ingenious illustration to show\r\nthat it is not inconsistent with theistic design. A few paragraphs here\r\nquoted show the felicity of his style in a controverted matter:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Recall a woman of a past generation and show her a web of cloth; ask\r\n  her how it was made, and she will say that the wool or cotton was\r\n  carded, spun, and woven by hand. When you tell her it was not made by\r\n  manual labor, that probably no hands have touched the materials\r\n  throughout the process, it is possible that she might at first regard\r\n  your statement as tantamount to the assertion that the cloth was made\r\n  without design. If she did, she would not credit your statement. If\r\n  you patiently explained to her the theory of carding-machines,\r\n  spinning-jennies, and power-looms, would her reception of your\r\n  explanation weaken her conviction that the cloth was the result of\r\n  design? It is certain that she would believe in design as firmly as\r\n  before, and that this belief would be attended by a higher conception\r\n  and reverent admiration of a wisdom, skill, and power greatly beyond\r\n  anything she had previously conceived possible.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this review Gray disarmed hostility to such an extent that some\r\npersons who had been antagonistic to Darwinism accepted it with only\r\nslight reservation. It may be fairly claimed that the Journal bore a\r\nleading part in influencing the views of naturalists in America in\r\nregard to the Darwinian theory.\r\n\r\nDr. Gray soon put the Darwinian hypothesis to a severe test. In the\r\nJournal for 1840 he had called attention to the remarkable similarity\r\nwhich exists between the flora of Japan and a part of the temperate\r\nportion of North America. The first notice of this subject by him occurs\r\nin a short review of Dr. Zuccarini’s “Flora Japonica,” a work based on\r\nmaterial furnished by Dr. Siebold, who had long lived in Japan. In this\r\nreview (=39=, 175, 1840), he enumerates certain plants common to the two\r\nregions, and says, “It is interesting to remark how many of our\r\ncharacteristic genera are reproduced in Japan, not to speak of striking\r\nanalogous forms.” In a subsequent paper (=28=, 187, 1859), he recurs to\r\nthis subject, and, after alluding to geological data furnished by J. D.\r\nDana, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “I cannot resist the conclusion that the extant vegetable kingdom has\r\n  a long and eventful history, and that the explanation of apparent\r\n  anomalies in the geographical distribution of species may be found in\r\n  the various and prolonged climatic or other vicissitudes to which they\r\n  have been subject in earlier times; that the occurrence of certain\r\n  species, formerly supposed to be peculiar to North America, in a\r\n  remote or antipodal region, affords in itself no presumption that they\r\n  were originated there, and that interchange of plants between eastern\r\n  North America and eastern Asia is explicable upon the most natural and\r\n  generally received hypothesis (or at least offers no greater\r\n  difficulty than does the arctic flora, the general homogeneousness of\r\n  which round the world has always been thought compatible with local\r\n  origin of the species) and is perhaps not more extensive than might be\r\n  expected under the circumstances. That the interchange has mainly\r\n  taken place in high northern latitudes, and that the isothermal lines\r\n  have in earlier times turned northward on our eastern and southward on\r\n  our northwest coast, as they do now, are points which go far towards\r\n  explaining why eastern North America, rather than Oregon and\r\n  California, has been mainly concerned in this interchange, and why the\r\n  temperate interchange, even with Europe, has principally taken place\r\n  through Asia.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From “Life and Letters of Charles Darwin” by Francis\r\nDarwin.]\r\n\r\nThis paper was communicated in 1859, on the eve of the publication of\r\nDarwin’s “Origin of Species.” At a later date he applied the Darwinian\r\ntheory to the possible solution of the problem, and came to the\r\nconclusion that the two floras had a common origin in the Arctic zone,\r\nduring the Tertiary period, or the Cretaceous which preceded it, and the\r\ndescendants had made their way down different lines toward the south,\r\nthe species varying under different climatic conditions, and thus\r\nexhibiting similarity but not absolute identity of form. Before the\r\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science, in his Presidential\r\naddress, in 1872, he used the following language:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “According to these views, as regards plants at least, the adaptation\r\n  to successive times and changed conditions has been maintained, not by\r\n  absolute renewals, but by gradual modifications. I, for one, cannot\r\n  doubt that the present existing species are the lineal successors of\r\n  those that garnished the earth in the old time before them, and that\r\n  they were as well adapted to their surroundings then, as those which\r\n  flourish and bloom around us are to their conditions now. Order and\r\n  exquisite adaptation did not wait for man’s coming, nor were they ever\r\n  stereotyped. Organic Nature—by which I mean the system and totality of\r\n  living things, and their adaptation to each other and to the\r\n  world—with all its apparent and indeed real stability, should be\r\n  likened, not to the ocean, which varies only by tidal oscillations\r\n  from a fixed level to which it is always returning, but rather to a\r\n  river, so vast that we can neither discern its shores nor reach its\r\n  sources, whose onward flow is not less actual because too slow to be\r\n  observed by the ephemeræ which hover over its surface, or are borne\r\n  upon its bosom.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGray’s active interest in the Journal continued until the very end of\r\nhis life. There were many critical notices from his pen in 1887. His\r\nlast contribution to its pages was the botanical necrology, which\r\nappeared posthumously in volume =35=, of the third series (1888). His\r\nconnection with the Journal covered, therefore, a period of more than a\r\nhalf a century of its life.[185]\r\n\r\nThe changes that were wrought in botany by the application of Darwinism\r\nwere far reaching. Attempts were promptly made to reconstruct the system\r\nof botanical classification on the basis of descent. The more successful\r\nof these endeavors met with welcome, and now form the groundwork of\r\narrangement of families, genera, and species, in the Herbaria in this\r\ncountry, in the manuals of descriptive botany, and in the text-books of\r\nhigher grade. This overturn did not take place until after Gray’s death,\r\nalthough he foresaw that the revolution was impending.\r\n\r\nOne of the most obvious changes was that which gave a high degree of\r\nprominence in American school treatises to the study of the lower\r\ninstead of the higher or flowering plants, these latter being treated\r\nmerely as members in a long series, and with scant consideration. But of\r\nlate years, there has been a renewed popular interest in the phænogamia,\r\nleading to a more thorough investigation of local floras, and also to\r\nthe examination of the relations of plants to their surroundings. The\r\nresults of a large part of this technical work are published in strictly\r\nbotanical periodicals and now-a-days seldom find a place in the pages of\r\na general journal of science.\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Cryptogamic Botany in the Journal since 1846._\r\n\r\nIn glancing rapidly at the First Series it has been seen that a fair\r\nshare of attention was early paid by the Journal to the flowerless\r\nplants. So far as the means and methods of the time permitted, the\r\nferns, mosses, lichens, and the larger algæ and fungi of America were\r\nstudied assiduously and important results were published, chiefly on the\r\nside of systematic botany.\r\n\r\nThe Second Series comprises the years between 1846 and 1871. In this\r\nseries one finds that the range of cryptogamic botany is much widened.\r\nBesides interesting book notices relative to these plants, there are a\r\ngood many papers on the larger fungi, on the algæ, and mosses. Here are\r\ncontributions by Curtis, by Ravenel, by Bailey, and by Sullivant. The\r\nlichens are treated of in detail by Tuckerman, and there are some\r\nexcellent translations by Dr. Engelmann of papers by Alexander Braun.\r\nSome of the destructive fungi are considered, as might well be the case\r\nin the period of the potato famine. It is in these years that one first\r\nfinds the name of Daniel Cady Eaton, who later had so much to do with\r\ndeveloping an interest in the subject of ferns in this country. He was a\r\nfrequent contributor of critical notices.\r\n\r\nCryptogamic Botany, as it is now understood, is a comparatively modern\r\nbranch of science. The appliances and the methods for investigating the\r\nmore obscure groups, and especially for revealing the successive stages\r\nof their development, were unsatisfactory until the latter half of the\r\nlast century. Gray recognized this condition of affairs, and appreciated\r\nthe importance of the new methods and the better appliances. Therefore\r\nhe viewed with satisfaction the pursuit of these studies abroad by one\r\nof his students and assistants, William G. Farlow. Dr. Farlow carried to\r\nhis studies under DeBary and others unusual powers of observation and\r\ngreat industry. He speedily became an accomplished investigator in\r\ncryptogamic botany and enriched the science by notable discoveries, one\r\nof which to-day bears his name in botanical literature. On his return to\r\nthe United States, Farlow entered at once upon a successful career as an\r\ninspiring teacher and a fruitful investigator. He became a frequent\r\ncontributor to the Journal, keeping its readers in touch with the more\r\nimportant additions to cryptogamic botany. He had wisely chosen to deal\r\nwith the whole field, and consequently he has been able to preserve a\r\nbetter perspective than is kept by the extreme specialist. The greater\r\nnumber of cryptogamic botanists in this country have been under\r\nProfessor Farlow’s instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n          _Systematic and Geographical Botany of Late Years._\r\n\r\nThe usefulness of the Journal in descriptive systematic botany of\r\nphanerogams is shown not only by its acceptance of the leading features\r\nof DeCandolle’s Phytography, where very exact methods are inculcated,\r\nbut by the very numerous contributions by Sereno Watson and others at\r\nthe Harvard University Herbarium, as well as from private systematists.\r\nIt is in the pages of the Journal that one finds the record of much of\r\nthe critical work of Tuckerman and of Engelmann, in interesting\r\nPhanerogamia. Of late years the Journal has had the privilege, of\r\npublishing a good deal of the careful work of Theo Holm, in the\r\ndifficult groups of Cyperaceæ, and also his admirable studies in the\r\nmorphology and the anatomy of certain interesting plants of higher\r\norders.\r\n\r\nAttention was called, in passing, to Gray’s deep interest in\r\ngeographical botany. In this important branch, besides his\r\ncontributions, one finds, among many others, such papers as LeConte’s\r\n“Flora of the Coast Islands of California in Relation to Recent Changes\r\nof Physical Geography” (=34=, 457, 1887), and Sargent’s “Forests of\r\nCentral Nevada” (=17=, 417, 1879). Examination reveals a surprising\r\nnumber of communications which bear indirectly upon this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Paleontological Botany._\r\n\r\nWhen the Journal began its career, the subject of fossil plants was very\r\nobscure. Brongniart’s papers, especially the Journal translations,\r\nenabled the students in America to undertake the investigation of such\r\nfossils and the results were to a considerable extent published in the\r\nJournal. Since the subject belongs as much to geology as to botany, it\r\nfinds its appropriate home in the pages of the Journal. The recent\r\npapers on this topic show how great has been the advance in methods and\r\nresults since the early days of the Journal’s century. Under the care of\r\nGeorge E. Wieland, the communications and the bibliographical notices of\r\npaleontological treatises show the progress which he and others are\r\nmaking in this attractive field.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Economic Botany, Plant Physiology, etc._\r\n\r\nAt the outset, the Journal, as we have seen, devoted much attention to\r\ncertain phases of economic botany, and, even down to the present, it has\r\nmaintained its hold upon the subject. The correspondence of Jerome\r\nNicklès from 1853 to 1867 brought before its readers a vast number of\r\nvaluable items which would not in any other way have been known to them.\r\nAnd the Journal dealt wisely with the scientific side of agriculture,\r\nunder the hands of S. W. Johnson and J. H. Gilbert, and others, placing\r\nit on its proper basis. This work was supplemented by Norton’s\r\nremarkable work in the chemistry of certain plants, the oat, for\r\nexample, and certain plant-products. In fact it might be possible to\r\nconstruct from the pages of the Journal a fair synopsis of the important\r\nprinciples of agronomy.\r\n\r\nPhysiology has been represented not only by the studies which had been\r\ninaugurated and stimulated by the Darwinian theory, such as the\r\ncross-fertilization and the close-fertilization of plants,\r\nplant-movements, and the like, but there have been a good many special\r\ncommunications, such as Dandeno on toxicity, Plowman on electrical\r\nrelations, and ionization, and W. P. Wilson on respiration.\r\n\r\nThere are many broad philosophical questions which have found an\r\nappropriate home in the Journal, such as “The Plant-individual in its\r\nrelation to the species” (Alexander Braun, =19=, 297, 1855; =20=, 181,\r\n1855), and “The analogy between the mode of reproduction in plants and\r\nthe alternation of generations observed in some radiata” (J. D. Dana,\r\n=10=, 341, 1850). Akin to these are many of the reflections which one\r\nfinds scattered throughout the pages of the Journal, frequently in minor\r\nbook notices. As might be expected, some attention has been paid to the\r\nvery special branch of botany which is strictly called medical. For\r\nexample, early in its history, the Journal published a long treatise by\r\nDr. William Tully (=2=, 45, 1820), on the ergot of rye. This is\r\nconsidered from a structural as well as from a medical point of view and\r\nis decidedly ahead of the time in which it was written. There are a few\r\nreferences to vegetable poisons, and there is a fascinating account of\r\nthe effect of the common white ash on the activities of the rattlesnake.\r\nIn short it may be said that the editor did much towards making the\r\nJournal readable as well as strictly scientific.\r\n\r\nThe list of reviewers who have been permitted to use the pages of the\r\nJournal for notices of botanical and allied books in recent years is\r\npretty long. One finds the initials of Wesley R. Coe, George P. Clinton,\r\nArthur L. Dean, Alexander W. Evans, William G. Farlow, George L.\r\nGoodale, Arthur H. Graves, Herbert E. Gregory, Lafayette B. Mendel, Leo\r\nF. Rettger, Benjamin L. Robinson, George R. Wieland, and others.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, in the biological sciences, as in every department\r\nof thought, there is great specialization, and each specialty demands\r\nits own private organ of publication. Naturally this has led to a\r\nfalling off in the botanical communications to the Journal, but it\r\ncannot be forgotten that the history of North American Botany has been\r\nlargely recorded in its pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _Notes._\r\n\r\nFootnote 184:\r\n\r\n  Scientific Papers of Asa Gray.
