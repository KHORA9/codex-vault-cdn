The following notes on text format\r\napply to all texts and will not be repeated in full.\r\n\r\n_Italics and other text markings:_\r\n\r\nItalicized letters within words, representing expanded abbreviations,\r\nare shown in the e-text with braces (“curly brackets”): co{n}nyng{e}.\r\nReaders who find this added information distracting may globally delete\r\nall braces; they are not used for any other purpose. Whole-word italics\r\nare shown in the usual way with _lines_. Superscripts are shown with ^,\r\nand boldface or blackletter type with +marks+.\r\n\r\n_Page Layout:_\r\n\r\nIn the original book, each text page contained several types of\r\nsecondary material printed in all four margins. The HTML version of\r\nthis e-text offers a closer approximation of the original appearance.\r\n\r\n_Headnotes_ appeared at the top of alternate pages, like subsidiary\r\nchapter headings. In longer selections they have been retained and\r\nmoved to the beginning of the most appropriate paragraph; some are\r\nalso grouped at the beginning of a selection to act as a detailed\r\ntable of contents.\r\n\r\n_Footnotes_ were numbered separately for each page. In this e-text,\r\ngeneral footnotes are numbered sequentially and grouped at the end of\r\nthe selection. In some selections, text notes (glosses or variant\r\nreadings) are marked with capital letters [A] and are kept in small\r\ngroups near each passage. Footnotes in the form [[10a]] are additional\r\nnotes from the editor’s Corrigenda. Footnotes with symbols [10*] are\r\n_footnotes to footnotes_.\r\n\r\n_Sidenotes_ were generally added by the editor to give translations\r\nor summaries. In this e-text, they are always collected into full\r\nsentences. In some verse selections, sidenotes appear immediately\r\n_before_ their original location, with no further marking. In other\r\nselections-- including all prose passages-- sidenotes are collected\r\ninto longer paragraphs and placed _after_ the text they refer to. These\r\nwill be identified either by line number or by lower-case letters [a]\r\nshowing their original location.\r\n\r\nSidenotes in the form [Fol. 10b] or [Page 27] are shown inline, within\r\nthe body text.

The Society has never had money\r\nenough to produce the Texts that could easily have been got ready for\r\nit; and many Editors are now anxious to send to press the work they have\r\nprepared. The necessity has therefore arisen for trying to increase the\r\nnumber of the Society’s members, and to induce its well-wishers to help\r\nit by gifts of money, either in one sum or by instalments. The Committee\r\ntrust that every Member will bring before his or her friends and\r\nacquaintances the Society’s claims for liberal support. Until all Early\r\nEnglish MSS. are printed, no proper History of our Language or Social\r\nLife is possible.\r\n\r\nThe Subscription to the Society, which constitutes membership, is £1 1s.\r\na year for the ORIGINAL SERIES, and £1 1s. for the EXTRA SERIES, due in\r\nadvance on the 1st of JANUARY, and should be paid by Cheque, Postal\r\nOrder, or Money-Order, crost ‘Union Bank of London,’ to the Hon.\r\nSecretary, W. A. DALZIEL, Esq., 67, Victoria Rd., Finsbury Park,\r\nLondon, N. Members who want their Texts posted to them, must add to\r\ntheir prepaid Subscriptions 1s. for the Original Series, and 1s. for the\r\nExtra Series, yearly. The Society’s Texts are also sold separately at\r\nthe prices put after them in the Lists; but Members can get back-Texts\r\nat one-third less than the List-prices by sending the cash for them in\r\nadvance to the Hon. Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n-> The Society intends to complete, as soon as its funds will allow, the\r\nReprints of its out-of-print Texts of the year 1866, and also of nos.\r\n20, 26 and 33. Prof. Skeat has finisht _Partenay_; Dr. McKnight of Ohio\r\n_King Horn_ and _Floris and Blancheflour_; and Dr. Furnivall his\r\n_Political, Religious and Love Poems_ and _Myrc’s Duties of a Parish\r\nPriest_. Dr. Otto Glauning has undertaken _Seinte Marherete_; and Dr.\r\nFurnivall has _Hali Meidenhad_ in type. As the cost of these Reprints,\r\nif they were not needed, would have been devoted to fresh Texts, the\r\nReprints will be sent to all Members in lieu of such Texts. Though\r\ncalled ‘Reprints,’ these books are new editions, generally with valuable\r\nadditions, a fact not noticed by a few careless receivers of them, who\r\nhave complained that they already had the volumes. As the Society’s\r\ncopies of the _Facsimile of the Epinal MS._ issued as an Extra Volume\r\nin 1883 are exhausted, Mr. J. H. Hessels, M.A., of St. John’s Coll.,\r\nCambridge, has kindly undertaken an edition of the MS. for the Society.\r\nThis will be substituted for the Facsimile as an 1883 book, but will be\r\nalso issued to all the present Members.\r\n\r\nJULY 1904. The Original-Series Texts for 1903 were: No. 122, Part II of\r\n_The Laud MS. Troy-Book_, edited from the unique Laud MS. 595 by Dr.\r\nJ. E. Wülting; and No. 123, Part II of Robert of Brunne’s _Handlyng\r\nSynne_, and its French original, ed. by Dr. F. J. Furnivall.\r\n\r\nThe Extra-Series Texts for 1903 are to be: No. LXXXVIII, _Le Morte\r\nArthur_, in 8-line stanzas, re-edited from the unique MS. Harl. 2252,\r\nby Prof. J. Douglas Bruce (issued), No. LXXXIX, Lydgate’s _Reason and\r\nSensuality_, edited by Dr. Ernst Sieper, Part II, and _English Fragments\r\nfrom Latin Medieval Service-Books_, edited, and given to the Society, by\r\nMr. Henry Littlehales.\r\n\r\nThe Original-Series Texts for 1904 will be No. 124, t. Hen. V,\r\n_Twenty-six Political and other Poems_ from the Digby MS. 102, &c,\r\nedited by Dr. J. Kail, and No. 125, Part I of the _Medieval Records of\r\na London City Church_ (St. Mary-at-Hill), A.D. 1420-1559, copied and\r\nedited by Mr. Henry Littlehales from the Church Records in the\r\nGuildhall, the cost of the setting and corrections of the text being\r\ngenerously borne by its Editor. This book will show the income and\r\noutlay of the church; the drink provided for its Palm-Sunday players,\r\nits officers’ excursions into Kent and Essex, its dealing with the\r\nPlague, the disposal of its goods at the Reformation, &c., &c., and will\r\nhelp our members to realize the church-life of its time. The third Text\r\nwill be Part I of _An Alphabet of Tales_, a very interesting collection,\r\nenglisht in the Northern Dialect, about 1440, from the Latin _Alphabetum\r\nNarrationum_ by Etienne de Bésançon, and edited by Mrs. M. M. Banks from\r\nthe unique MS. in the King’s Library in the British Museum; the\r\nabove-named three texts are now ready for issue. Those for 1905 and 1906\r\nwill probably be chosen from Part II of the _Exeter Book_--Anglo-Saxon\r\nPoems from the unique MS. in Exeter Cathedral--re-edited by Israel\r\nGollancz, M.A.; Part II of Prof. Dr. Holthausen’s _Vices and Virtues_;\r\nPart II of _Jacob’s Well_, edited by Dr. Brandeis; the Alliterative\r\n_Siege of Jerusalem_, edited by the late Prof. Dr. E. Kölbing and Prof.\r\nDr. Kaluza; an Introduction and Glossary to the _Minor Poems of the\r\nVernon MS._ by H. Hartley, M.A.; Alain Chartier’s _Quadrilogue_, edited\r\nfrom the unique MS. Univ. Coll. Oxford MS. No. 85, by Mr. J. W. H.\r\nAtkins of Owen’s College; a Northern Verse _Chronicle of England_ to\r\n1327 A.D., in 42,000 lines, about 1420 A.D., edited by M. L. Perrin,\r\nB.A.; Prof. Bruce’s Introduction to _The English Conquest of Ireland_,\r\nPart II; and Dr. Furnivall’s edition of the _Lichfield Gilds_, which is\r\nall printed, and waits only for the Introduction, that Prof. E. C. K.\r\nGonner has kindly undertaken to write for the book. Canon Wordsworth of\r\nMarlborough has given the Society a copy of the Leofric Canonical Rule,\r\nLatin and Anglo-Saxon, Parker MS. 191, C.C.C. Cambridge, and Prof.\r\nNapier will edit it, with a fragment of the englisht Capitula of Bp.\r\nTheodulf. The _Coventry Leet Book_ is being copied for the Society by\r\nMiss M. Dormer Harris--helpt by a contribution from the Common Council\r\nof the City,--and will be publisht by the Society (Miss Harris editing),\r\nas its contribution to our knowledge of the provincial city life of the\r\n15th century.\r\n\r\nDr. Brie of Berlin has undertaken to edit the prose _Brut_ or _Chronicle\r\nof Britain_ attributed to Sir John Mandeville, and printed by Caxton. He\r\nhas already examined more than 100 English MSS. and several French ones,\r\nto get the best text, and find out its source.\r\n\r\nThe Extra-Series Texts for 1904 will be chosen from Lydgate’s\r\n_DeGuilleville’s Pilgrimage of the Life of Man_, Part III, edited by\r\nMiss Locock; Dr. M. Konrath’s re-edition of _William of Shorcham’s\r\nPoems_, Part II; Dr. E. A. Kock’s edition of Lovelich’s _Merlin_ from\r\nthe unique MS. in Corpus Christi Coll., Cambridge; the _Macro Plays_,\r\nedited from Mr. Gurney’s MS. by Dr. Furnivall and A. W. Pollard, M.A.;\r\nProf. Erdmann’s re-edition of Lydgate’s _Siege of Thebes_ (issued also\r\nby the Chaucer Society); Miss Rickert’s re-edition of the Romance of\r\n_Emare_; Prof. I. Gollanez’s re-edition of two Alliterative Poems,\r\n_Winner and Waster_, &c, ab. 1360, lately issued for the Roxburghe Club;\r\nDr. Norman Moore’s re-edition of _The Book of the Foundation of St.\r\nBartholomew’s Hospital, London_, from the unique MS. ab. 1425, which\r\ngives an account of the Founder, Rahere, and the miraculous cures\r\nwrought at the Hospital; _The Craft of Nombrynge_, with other of the\r\nearliest englisht Treatises on Arithmetic, edited by R. Steele, B.A.;\r\nand Miss Warren’s two-text edition of _The Dance of Death_ from the\r\nEllesmere and other MSS.\r\n\r\nThese Extra-Series Texts ought to be completed by their Editors: the\r\nSecond Part of the prose Romance of _Melusine_--Introduction, with ten\r\nfacsimiles of the best woodblocks of the old foreign black-letter\r\neditions, Glossary, &c, by A. K. Donald, B.A. (now in India); and a new\r\nedition of the famous Early-English Dictionary (English and Latin),\r\n_Promptorium Parvulorum_, from the Winchester MS., ab. 1440 A.D.: in\r\nthis, the Editor, the Rev. A. L. Mayhew, M.A., will follow and print his\r\nMS. not only in its arrangement of nouns first, and verbs second, under\r\nevery letter of the Alphabet, but also in its giving of the flexions of\r\nthe words. The Society’s edition will thus be the first modern one that\r\nreally represents its original, a point on which Mr. Mayhew’s insistence\r\nwill meet with the sympathy of all our Members.\r\n\r\nThe Texts for the Extra Series in 1906 and 1907 will be chosen from _The\r\nThree Kings’ Sons_, Part II, the Introduction &c. by Prof. Dr. Leon\r\nKellner; Part II of _The Chester Plays_, re-edited from the MSS., with a\r\nfull collation of the formerly missing Devonshire MS., by Mr. G. England\r\nand Dr. Matthews; the Parallel-Text of the only two MSS. of the _Owl and\r\nNightingale_, edited by Mr. G. F. H. Sykes (at press); Prof. Jespersen’s\r\neditions of John Hart’s _Orthographie_ (MS. 1551 A.D.; blackletter\r\n1569), and _Method to teach Reading_, 1570; Deguilleville’s _Pilgrimage\r\nof the Sowle_, in English prose, edited by Prof. Dr. L. Kellner. (For\r\nthe three prose versions of _The Pilgrimage of the Life of Man_--two\r\nEnglish, one French--an Editor is wanted.) Members are askt to realise\r\nthe fact that the Society has now 50 years’ work on its Lists,--at its\r\npresent rate of production,--and that there is from 100 to 200 more\r\nyears’ work to come after that. The year 2000 will not see finisht all\r\nthe Texts that the Society ought to print. The need of more Members and\r\nmoney is pressing. Offers of help from willing Editors have continually\r\nto be declined because the Society has no funds to print their Texts.\r\n\r\nAn urgent appeal is hereby made to Members to increase the list of\r\nSubscribers to the E. E. Text Society. It is nothing less than a scandal\r\nthat the Hellenic Society should have nearly 1000 members, while the\r\nEarly English Text Society has not 300!\r\n\r\nBefore his death in 1895, Mr. G. N. Currie was preparing an edition of\r\nthe 15th and 16th century Prose Versions of Guillaume de Deguilleville’s\r\n_Pilgrimage of the Life of Man_, with the French prose version by Jean\r\nGallopes, from Lord Aldenham’s MS., he having generously promist to pay\r\nthe extra cost of printing the French text, and engraving one or two of\r\nthe illuminations in his MS. But Mr. Currie, when on his deathbed,\r\ncharged a friend to burn _all_ his MSS. which lay in a corner of his\r\nroom, and unluckily all the E. E. T. S.’s copies of the Deguilleville\r\nprose versions were with them, and were burnt with them, so that the\r\nSociety will be put to the cost of fresh copies, Mr. Currie having died\r\nin debt.\r\n\r\nGuillaume de Deguilleville, monk of the Cistercian abbey of Chaalis, in\r\nthe diocese of Senlis, wrote his first verse _Pèlerinaige de l’Homme_ in\r\n1330-1 when he was 36.[1] Twenty-five (or six) years after, in 1355, he\r\nrevised his poem, and issued a second version of it,[2] a revision of\r\nwhich was printed ab. 1500. Of the prose representative of the first\r\nversion, 1330-1, a prose Englishing, about 1430 A.D., was edited by Mr.\r\nAldis Wright for the Roxburghe Club in 1869, from MS. Ff. 5. 30 in the\r\nCambridge University Library. Other copies of this prose English are in\r\nthe Hunterian Museum, Glasgow, Q. 2. 25; Sion College, London; and the\r\nLaud Collection in the Bodleian, no. 740.[3] A copy in the Northern\r\ndialect is MS. G. 21, in St. John’s Coll., Cambridge, and this is the\r\nMS. which will be edited for the E. E. Text Society. The Laud MS. 740\r\nwas somewhat condenst and modernised, in the 17th century, into MS. Ff.\r\n6. 30, in the Cambridge University Library:[4] “The Pilgrime or the\r\nPilgrimage of Man in this World,” copied by Will. Baspoole, whose copy\r\n“was verbatim written by Walter Parker, 1645, and from thence\r\ntranscribed by G. G. 1649; and from thence by W. A. 1655.” This last\r\ncopy may have been read by, or its story reported to, Bunyan, and may\r\nhave been the groundwork of his _Pilgrim’s Progress_. It will be edited\r\nfor the E. E. T. Soc., its text running under the earlier English, as in\r\nMr. Herrtage’s edition of the _Gesta Romanorum_ for the Society. In\r\nFebruary 1464,[5] Jean Gallopes--a clerk of Angers, afterwards chaplain\r\nto John, Duke of Bedford, Regent of France--turned Deguilleville’s first\r\nverse _Pèlerinaige_ into a prose _Pèlerinage de la vie humaine_.[6] By\r\nthe kindness of Lord Aldenham, as above mentiond, Gallopes’s French text\r\nwill be printed opposite the early prose northern Englishing in the\r\nSociety’s edition.\r\n\r\nThe Second Version of Deguilleville’s _Pèlerinaige de l’Homme_, A.D.\r\n1355 or -6, was englisht in verse by Lydgate in 1426. Of Lydgate’s poem,\r\nthe larger part is in the Cotton MS. Vitellius C. xiii (leaves 2-308).\r\nThis MS. leaves out Chaucer’s englishing of Deguilleville’s _ABC_ or\r\n_Prayer to the Virgin_, of which the successive stanzas start with A, B,\r\nC, and run all thro’ the alphabet; and it has 2 main gaps, besides many\r\nsmall ones from the tops of leaves being burnt in the Cotton fire. All\r\nthese gaps (save the A B C) have been fild up from the Stowe MS. 952\r\n(which old John Stowe completed) and from the end of the other imperfect\r\nMS. Cotton, Tiberius A vii. Thanks to the diligence of the old\r\nElizabethan tailor and manuscript-lover, a complete text of Lydgate’s\r\npoem can be given, though that of an inserted theological prose treatise\r\nis incomplete. The British Museum French MSS. (Harleian 4399,[7] and\r\nAdditional 22,937[8] and 25,594[9]) are all of the First Version.\r\n\r\nBesides his first _Pèlerinaige de l’homme_ in its two versions,\r\nDeguilleville wrote a second, “de l’ame separee du corps,” and a third,\r\n“de nostre seigneur Iesus.” Of the second, a prose Englishing of 1413,\r\n_The Pilgrimage of the Sowle_ (with poems by Hoccleve, already printed\r\nfor the Society with that author’s _Regement of Princes_), exists in the\r\nEgerton MS. 615,[10] at Hatfield, Cambridge (Univ. Kk. 1. 7, and Caius),\r\nOxford (Univ. Coll. and Corpus), and in Caxton’s edition of 1483. This\r\nversion has ‘somewhat of addicions’ as Caxton says, and some shortenings\r\ntoo, as the maker of both, the first translater, tells us in the MSS.\r\nCaxton leaves out the earlier englisher’s interesting Epilog in the\r\nEgerton MS. This prose englishing of the _Sowle_ will be edited for the\r\nSociety by Prof. Dr. Leon Kellner after that of the _Man_ is finisht,\r\nand will have Gallopes’s French opposite it, from Lord Aldenham’s MS.,\r\nas his gift to the Society. Of the Pilgrimage of Jesus, no englishing is\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nAs to the MS. Anglo-Saxon Psalters, Dr. Hy. Sweet has edited the oldest\r\nMS., the Vespasian, in his _Oldest English Texts_ for the Society, and\r\nMr. Harsley has edited the latest, c. 1150, Eadwine’s Canterbury\r\nPsalter. The other MSS., except the Paris one, being interlinear\r\nversions,--some of the Roman-Latin redaction, and some of the\r\nGallican,--Prof. Logeman has prepared for press, a Parallel-Text edition\r\nof the first twelve Psalms, to start the complete work. He will do his\r\nbest to get the Paris Psalter--tho’ it is not an interlinear one--into\r\nthis collective edition; but the additional matter, especially in the\r\nVerse-Psalms, is very difficult to manage. If the Paris text cannot be\r\nparallelised, it will form a separate volume. The Early English Psalters\r\nare all independent versions, and will follow separately in due course.\r\n\r\nThrough the good offices of the Examiners, some of the books for the\r\nEarly-English Examinations of the University of London will be chosen\r\nfrom the Society’s publications, the Committee having undertaken to\r\nsupply such books to students at a large reduction in price. The net\r\nprofits from these sales will be applied to the Society’s Reprints.\r\n\r\nMembers are reminded that _fresh Subscribers are always wanted_, and\r\nthat the Committee can at anytime, on short notice, send to press an\r\nadditional Thousand Pounds’ worth of work.\r\n\r\nThe Subscribers to the Original Series must be prepared for the issue of\r\nthe whole of the Early English _Lives of Saints_, sooner or later. The\r\nSociety cannot leave out any of them, even though some are dull. The\r\nSinners would doubtless be much more interesting. But in many Saints’\r\nLives will be found valuable incidental details of our forefathers’\r\nsocial state, and all are worthful for the history of our language. The\r\nLives may be lookt on as the religious romances or story-books of their\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe Standard Collection of Saints’ Lives in the Corpus and Ashmole MSS.,\r\nthe Harleian MS. 2277, &c. will repeat the Laud set, our No. 87, with\r\nadditions, and in right order. (The foundation MS. (Laud 108) had to be\r\nprinted first, to prevent quite unwieldy collations.) The Supplementary\r\nLives from the Vernon and other MSS. will form one or two separate\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\nBesides the Saints’ Lives, Trevisa’s englishing of _Bartholomæus de\r\nProprietatibus Rerum_, the mediæval Cyclopædia of Science, &c, will be\r\nthe Society’s next big undertaking. Dr. R. von Fleischhacker will edit\r\nit. Prof. Napier of Oxford, wishing to have the whole of our MS.\r\nAnglo-Saxon in type, and accessible to students, will edit for the\r\nSociety all the unprinted and other Anglo-Saxon Homilies which are not\r\nincluded in Thorpe’s edition of Ælfric’s prose,[11] Dr. Morris’s of the\r\nBlickling Homilies, and Prof. Skeat’s of Ælfric’s Metrical Homilies. The\r\nlate Prof. Kölbing left complete his text, for the Society, of the\r\n_Ancren Riwle_, from the best MS., with collations of the other four,\r\nand this will be edited for the Society by Dr. Thümmler. Mr. Harvey\r\nmeans to prepare an edition of the three MSS. of the _Earliest English\r\nMetrical Psalter_, one of which was edited by the late Mr. Stevenson for\r\nthe Surtees Society.\r\n\r\nMembers of the Society will learn with pleasure that its example has\r\nbeen followed, not only by the Old French Text Society which has done\r\nsuch admirable work under its founders Profs. Paul Meyer and Gaston\r\nParis, but also by the Early Russian Text Society, which was set on foot\r\nin 1877, and has since issued many excellent editions of old MS.\r\nChronicles, &c.\r\n\r\nMembers will also note with pleasure the annexation of large tracts of\r\nour Early English territory by the important German contingent, the late\r\nProfessors Zupitza and Kölbing, the living Hausknecht, Einenkel,\r\nHaenisch, Kaluza, Hupe, Adam, Holthausen, Schick, Herzfeld, Brandeis,\r\nSieper, Konrath, Wülfing, &c. Scandinavia has also sent us Prof. Erdmann\r\nand Dr. E. A. Kock; Holland, Prof. H. Logeman, who is now working in\r\nBelgium; France, Prof. Paul Meyer--with Gaston Paris as adviser (alas,\r\nnow dead);--Italy, Prof. Lattanzi; Austria, Dr. von Fleischhacker; while\r\nAmerica is represented by the late Prof. Child, by Dr. Mary Noyes\r\nColvin, Miss Rickert, Profs. Mead, McKnight, Triggs, Perrin, &c. The\r\nsympathy, the ready help, which the Society’s work has cald forth from\r\nthe Continent and the United States, have been among the pleasantest\r\nexperiences of the Society’s life, a real aid and cheer amid all\r\ntroubles and discouragements. All our Members are grateful for it, and\r\nrecognise that the bond their work has woven between them and the lovers\r\nof language and antiquity across the seas is one of the most welcome\r\nresults of the Society’s efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL SERIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Early English Alliterative Poems_, ab. 1360 A.D., ed.

Moreover to teche\r\n  them sondry languages, and othyr lerninges vertuous, to harping,\r\n  to pype, sing, daunce, and with other honest and temperate\r\n  behaviour and patience; and to kepe dayly and wekely with these\r\n  children dew convenity, with corrections in theyre chambres,\r\n  according to suche gentylmen; and eche of them to be used to that\r\n  thinge of vertue that he shall be moste apt to lerne, with\r\n  remembraunce dayly of Goddes servyce accustumed. This maistyr\r\n  sittith in the halle, next unto these Henxmen, at the same boarde,\r\n  to have his respecte unto theyre demeanynges, howe manerly they\r\n  ete and drinke, and to theyre communication and other formes\r\n  curiall, after _the booke of urbanitie_.” (Liber Niger in\r\n  _Household Ordinances_, p. 45.)\r\n\r\nThat these young Henxmen were gentlemen, is expressly stated,[6] and\r\nthey had “everyche of them an honest servaunt to keepe theyre chambre\r\nand harneys, and to aray hym in this courte whyles theyre maisters he\r\npresent in courte.” I suppose that when they grew up, some became\r\nEsquires, and then their teaching would prove of use, for\r\n\r\n  “These Esquiers of houshold of old [were] accustumed, wynter and\r\n  sumer, in aftyrnoones and in eveninges, to drawe to lordes\r\n  chambres within courte, there to kepe honest company aftyr theyre\r\n  cunnynge, in talkyng of cronycles of Kings and of other polycyes,\r\n  or in pypeyng or harpyng, synging, or other actes martialles, to\r\n  help occupy the courte, and accompany straungers, tyll the tyme\r\n  require of departing.”\r\n\r\nBut that a higher station than an Esquier’s was in store for some of\r\nthese henchmen, may be known from the history of one of them. Thomas\r\nHoward, eldest son of Sir John Howard, knight (who was afterwards Duke\r\nof Norfolk, and killed at Bosworth Field), was among these henchmen or\r\npages, ‘enfauntes’ six or more, of Edward IV.’s. He was made Duke of\r\nNorfolk for his splendid victory over the Scots at Flodden, and Anne\r\nBoleyn and Catherine Howard were his granddaughters. Among the ‘othyr\r\nlerninges vertuous’ taught him at Edward’s court was no doubt that of\r\ndrawing, for we find that ‘He was buried with much pomp at Thetford\r\nAbbey under a tomb designed by himself and master Clarke, master of the\r\nworks at King’s College, Cambridge, & Wassel a freemason of Bury S.\r\nEdmund’s.’ Cooper’s _Ath. Cant._, i. p. 29, col. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: RICH MEN’S EDUCATION IN EARLY ENGLAND.]\r\n\r\nThe question of the social rank of these Bele Babees,[[6a]] children,\r\nand _Pueri_ who stood at tables, opens up the whole subject of\r\nupper-class education in early times in England. It is a subject that,\r\nso far as I can find, has never yet been separately treated[7], and I\r\ntherefore throw together such few notices as the kindness of friends[8]\r\nand my own chance grubbings have collected; these as a sort of stopgap\r\ntill the appearance of Mr Anstey’s volume on early Oxford Studies in the\r\n_Chronicles and Memorials_, a volume which will, I trust, give us a\r\ncomplete account of early education in our land. If it should not,\r\nI hope that Mr Quick will carry his pedagogic researches past Henry\r\nVIII.’s time, or that one of our own members will take the subject up.\r\nIt is worthy of being thoroughly worked out. For convenience’ sake, the\r\nnotices I have mentioned are arranged under six heads:\r\n\r\n  1. Education in Nobles’ houses.\r\n  2. At Home and at Private Tutors’, p. xvii. (Girls, p. xxv.)\r\n  3. At English Universities, p. xxvi.\r\n  4. At Foreign Universities, p. xl.\r\n  5. At Monastic and Cathedral Schools, p. xli.\r\n  6. At Grammar Schools, p. lii.\r\n\r\nOne consideration should be premised, that manly exercises, manners and\r\ncourtesy, music and singing, knowledge of the order of precedency of\r\nranks, and ability to carve, were in early times more important than\r\nLatin and Philosophy. ‘Aylmar þe kyng’ gives these directions to\r\nAthelbrus, his steward, as to Horn’s education:\r\n\r\n    Stiwarde, tak nu here\r\n    Mi fundlyng for to lere                              228\r\n    Of þine meste{re},\r\n    Of wude {and} of riuere;\r\n    {And} tech him to harpe\r\n    Wiþ his nayles scharpe;                              232\r\n    Biuore me to kerue,\r\n    And of þe cupe serue;\r\n    Þu tech him of alle þe liste (craft, AS. _list_)\r\n    Þat þu eure of wiste;                                236\r\n    [And] his feiren þou wise (mates thou teach)\r\n    Into oþere s{er}uise.\r\n    Horn þu underuonge,\r\n    {And} tech him of harpe {and} songe.                 240\r\n\r\n  _King Horn_, E.

Music\r\nalone.[[10a]] That, as Harrison says, was one of the Quadrivials,\r\n‘arithmetike, musike, geometrie, and astronomie.’ The Trivium was\r\ngrammar, rhetoric, and logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: HOUSES OF NOBLES AND CHANCELLORS WERE SCHOOLS.]\r\n\r\n1. The chief places of education for the sons of our nobility and gentry\r\nwere the houses of other nobles, and specially those of the Chancellors\r\nof our Kings, men not only able to read and write, talk Latin and French\r\nthemselves, but in whose hands the Court patronage lay. As early as\r\nHenry the Second’s time (A.D. 1154-62), if not before[11], this system\r\nprevailed. A friend notes that Fitz-Stephen says of Becket:\r\n\r\n  “The nobles of the realm of England and of neighbouring kingdoms\r\n  used to send their sons to serve the Chancellor, whom he trained\r\n  with honourable bringing-up and learning; and when they had\r\n  received the knight’s belt, sent them back with honour to their\r\n  fathers and kindred: some he used to keep. The king himself, his\r\n  master, entrusted to him his son, the heir of the realm, to be\r\n  brought up; whom he had with him, with many sons of nobles of the\r\n  same age, and their proper retinue and masters and proper servants\r\n  in the honour due.” --_Vita S. Thomæ_, pp. 189, 190, ed. Giles.\r\n\r\nRoger de Hoveden, a Yorkshireman, who was a clerk or secretary to Henry\r\nthe Second, says of Richard the Lionheart’s unpopular chancellor,\r\nLongchamps the Bishop of Ely:\r\n\r\n  “All the sons of the nobles acted as his servants, with downcast\r\n  looks, nor dared they to look upward towards the heavens unless it\r\n  so happened that they were addressing him; and if they attended to\r\n  anything else they were pricked with a goad, which their lord held\r\n  in his hand, fully mindful of his grandfather of pious memory,\r\n  who, being of servile condition in the district of Beauvais, had,\r\n  for his occupation, to guide the plough and whip up the oxen; and\r\n  who at length, to gain his liberty, fled to the Norman territory.”\r\n  (Riley’s _Hoveden_, ii. 232, quoted in _The Cornhill Magazine_,\r\n  vol. xv. p. 165.)[12]\r\n\r\nAll Chancellors were not brutes of this kind, but we must remember that\r\nyoung people were subjected to rough treatment in early days. Even so\r\nlate as Henry VI.’s time, Agnes Paston sends to London on the 28th of\r\nJanuary, 1457, to pray the master of her son of 15, that if the boy\r\n“hath not done well, nor will not amend,” his master Greenfield “will\r\ntruly belash him till he will amend.” And of the same lady’s treatment\r\nof her marriageable daughter, Elizabeth, Clere writes on the 29th of\r\nJune, 1454,\r\n\r\n  “She (the daughter) was never in so great sorrow as she is\r\n  now-a-days, for she may not speak with no man, whosoever come, ne\r\n  not may see nor speak with my man, nor with servants of her\r\n  mother’s, but that she beareth her on hand otherwise than she\r\n  meaneth; and she hath since Easter the most part been beaten once\r\n  in the week or twice, and sometimes twice on a day, and her head\r\n  broken in two or three places.” (v. i. p. 50, col. 1, ed. 1840.)\r\n\r\nThe treatment of Lady Jane Grey by her parents was also very severe, as\r\nshe told Ascham, though she took it meekly, as her sweet nature was:\r\n\r\n  “One of the greatest benefites that God ever gave me, is, that he\r\n  sent me so sharpe and severe Parentes, and so jentle a\r\n  scholemaster. For when I am in presence either of father or\r\n  mother, whether I speake, kepe silence, sit, stand, or go, eate,\r\n  drinke, be merie or sad, be sewyng, plaiyng, dauncing, or doing\r\n  anie thing els, I must do it, as it were, in soch weight, mesure,\r\n  and number, even so perfitelie as God made the world, or els I am\r\n  so sharplie taunted, so cruellie threatened; yea presentlie some\r\n  tymes, with pinches, nippes, and bobbes, and other waies which I\r\n  will not name for the honor I beare them, so without measure\r\n  misordered, that I thinke my self in hell till tyme cum that I\r\n  must go to _M. Elmer_, who teacheth me so jentlie, so pleasantlie,\r\n  with soch faire allurementes to learning, that I thinke all the\r\n  tyme nothing whiles I am with him. And when I am called from him,\r\n  I fall on weeping.” --_The Scholemaster_, ed. Mayor.\r\n\r\nThe inordinate beating[13] of boys by schoolmasters--whom he calls in\r\ndifferent places ‘sharp, fond, & lewd’[14]--Ascham denounces strongly in\r\nthe first book of his _Scholemaster_, and he contrasts their folly in\r\nbeating into their scholars the hatred of learning with the practice of\r\nthe wise riders who by gentle allurements breed them up in the love of\r\nriding. Indeed, the origin of his book was Sir Wm. Cecil’s saying to him\r\n“I have strange news brought me this morning, that divers scholars of\r\nEton be run away from the school for fear of beating.”\r\n\r\nSir Peter Carew, says Mr Froude, being rather a troublesome boy, was\r\nchained in the Haccombe dog-kennel till he ran away from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: BP. GROSSETETE TAUGHT NOBLES’ SONS.]\r\n\r\nBut to return to the training of young men in nobles’ houses. I take the\r\nfollowing from Fiddes’s Appendix to his Life of Wolsey:\r\n\r\n  _John de Athon_, upon the Constitutions of _Othobon, tit._ 23, in\r\n  respect to the Goods of such who dyed intestate, and upon the Word\r\n  _Barones_, has the following Passage concerning _Grodsted_ Bishop\r\n  of _Lincoln_[15] (who died 9th Oct., 1253),--\r\n\r\n  “Robert surnamed Grodsted of holy memory, late Bishop of Lincoln,\r\n  when King Henry asked him, as if in wonder, where he learnt the\r\n  Nurture in which he had instructed the sons of nobles (&) peers of\r\n  the Realm, whom he kept about him as pages\r\n  (_domisellos_[16]),--since he was not descended from a noble\r\n  lineage, but from humble (parents)--is said to have answered\r\n  fearlessly, ‘In the house or guest-chambers of greater kings than\r\n  the King of England’; because he had learnt from understanding the\r\n  scriptures the manner of life of David, Solomon, & other\r\n  Kings[15].”\r\n\r\n  _Reyner,_ in his _Apostol. Bened._ from _Saunders_ acquaints us,\r\n  that the Sons of the Nobility were placed with _Whiting_ Abbot of\r\n  _Glastenbury_ for their Education, who was contemporary with the\r\n  Cardinal, and which Method of Education was continued for some\r\n  Time afterward.\r\n\r\n  There is in the Custody of the present Earl of _Stafford_,\r\n  a Nobleman of the greatest Humanity and Goodness, an Original of\r\n  Instructions, by the Earl of _Arundell_, written in the Year 1620,\r\n  for the Benefit of his younger Son, the Earl of _Stafford’s_\r\n  Grandfather, under this Title;\r\n\r\n    _Instructions for you my Son _William_, how to behave\r\n        your self at _Norwich_._\r\n\r\n  In these Instructions is the following paragraph, “You shall in\r\n  all Things reverence honour and obey my Lord Bishop of _Norwich_,\r\n  as you would do any of your Parents, esteeminge whatsoever He\r\n  shall tell or Command you, as if your Grandmother of _Arundell_,\r\n  your Mother, or my self, should say it; and in all things esteem\r\n  your self as my Lord’s Page; a breeding which youths of my house\r\n  far superior to you were accustomed unto, as my Grandfather of\r\n  _Norfolk_, and his Brother my good Uncle of _Northampton_ were\r\n  both bred as Pages with Bishopps, _&c_.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas More, who was born in 1480, was brought up in the house of\r\nCardinal Morton. Roper says that he was\r\n\r\n  “received into the house of the right reverend, wise, and learned\r\n  prelate Cardinal Morton, where, though he was young of years, yet\r\n  would he at Christmas-tide suddenly sometimes step in among the\r\n  players, and never studying for the matter make a part of his own\r\n  there presently among them, which made the lookers on more sport\r\n  than all the players beside. In whose wit and towardness the\r\n  Cardinal much delighting would say of him unto the nobles that\r\n  divers times dined with him, _This child here waiting at the\r\n  table, Whosoever shall live to see it, will prove a marvellous\r\n  man._ Whereupon for his better furtherance in learning he placed\r\n  him at Oxford, &c.” (Roper’s _Life of More_, ed. Singer, 1822,\r\n  p. 3.)\r\n\r\nCresacre More in his _Life of More_ (ed. 1828, p. 17) states the same\r\nthing more fully, and gives the remark of the Cardinal more accurately,\r\nthus:-- “that that boy there waiting _on him_, whoever should live to\r\nsee it, would prove a marvellous rare man.”[17]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: YOUNG NOBLES IN WOLSEY’S HOUSEHOLD.]\r\n\r\nThrough Wolsey’s household, says Professor Brewer, almost all the\r\nOfficials of Henry the Eighth’s time passed. Cavendish, in his Life of\r\nWolsey (vol. i. p. 38, ed. Singer, 1825) says of the Cardinal, “And at\r\nmeals, there was continually in his chamber a board kept for his\r\nChamberlains, and Gentlemen Ushers, having with them _a mess of the\r\nyoung Lords_, and another for gentlemen.” Among these young Lords, we\r\nlearn at p. 57, was\r\n\r\n  “my Lord Percy, the son and heir of the Earl of Northumberland,\r\n  [who] then attended upon the Lord Cardinal, and was also his\r\n  servitor; and when it chanced the Lord Cardinal at any time to\r\n  repair to the court, the Lord Percy would then resort for his\r\n  pastime unto the queen’s chamber, and there would fall in\r\n  dalliance among the queen’s maidens, being at the last more\r\n  conversant with Mistress Anne Boleyn than with any other; so that\r\n  there grew such a secret love between them that, at length they\r\n  were insured together, intending to marry[18].”\r\n\r\nAmong the persons daily attendant upon Wolsey in his house, down-lying\r\nand up-rising, Cavendish enumerates “of Lords nine or ten, who had each\r\nof them allowed two servants; and the Earl of Derby had allowed five\r\nmen” (p. 36-7). On this Singer prints a note, which looks like a guess,\r\nsigned _Growe_, “Those Lords that were placed in the great and privy\r\nchambers were _Wards_, and as such paid for their board and education.”\r\nIt will be seen below that he had a particular officer called\r\n“Instructor of his Wards” (_Cavendish_, p. 38, l. 2). Why I suppose the\r\nnote to be a guess is, because at p. 33 Cavendish has stated that Wolsey\r\n“had also a great number daily attending upon him, both of noblemen and\r\nworthy gentlemen, of great estimation and possessions,--with no small\r\nnumber of the tallest yeomen that he could get in all his realm; in so\r\nmuch that well was that nobleman and gentleman that might prefer any\r\ntall and comely yeoman unto his service.”\r\n\r\nIn the household of the Earl of Northumberland in 1511 were “..yong\r\ngentlemen at their fryndes fynding,[19] in my lords house for the hoole\r\nyere” and “Haunsmen ande Yong Gentlemen at thir Fryndes fynding v[j] (As\r\nto say, Hanshmen iij. And Yong Gentlemen iij” p. 254,) no doubt for the\r\npurpose of learning manners, &c. And that such youths would be found in\r\nthe house of every noble of importance I believe, for as Walter Mapes\r\n(? ab. 1160-90 A.D.) says of the great nobles, in his poem _De diversis\r\nordinibus hominum_, the example of manners goes out from their houses,\r\n_Exemplar morum domibus procedit eorum_. That these houses were in some\r\ninstances only the finishing schools for our well-born young men after\r\nprevious teaching at home and at College is possible (though the cases\r\nof Sir Thomas More and Ascham are exactly the other way), but the Lord\r\nPercy last named had a schoolmaster in his house, “The Maister of\r\nGraimer j”, p. 254; “Lyverays for the Maister of Gramer[20] in\r\nHousholde: Item Half a Loof of Houshold Breide, a Pottell of Beere, and\r\ntwo White Lyghts,” p. 97. “Every Scolemaister techyng Grammer in the\r\nHous C _s_.” (p. 47, 51). Edward IV.’s henxmen were taught grammar; and\r\nif the Pastons are to be taken as a type of their class, our nobles and\r\ngentry at the end of the 15th century must have been able to read and\r\nwrite freely. Chaucer’s Squire could write, and though the custom of\r\nsealing deeds and not signing them prevailed, more or less, till Henry\r\nVIII.’s time, it is doubtful whether this implied inability of the\r\nsealers to write. Mr Chappell says that in Henry VIII.’s time half our\r\nnobility were then writing ballads. Still, the bad spelling and grammar\r\nof most of the letters up to that period, and the general ignorance of\r\nour upper classes were, says Professor Brewer, the reason why the whole\r\ngovernment of the country was in the hands of ecclesiastics. Even in\r\nHenry the Eighth’s time, Sir Thomas Boleyn is said to have been the only\r\nnoble at Court who could speak French with any degree of fluency, and so\r\nwas learned enough to be sent on an embassy abroad. But this may be\r\nquestioned. Yet Wolsey, speaking to his Lord Chamberlain and Comptroller\r\nwhen they\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: KNOWLEDGE OF FRENCH.]\r\n\r\n  “showed him that it seemed to them there should be some noblemen\r\n  and strangers [Henry VIII. and his courtiers masked] arrived at\r\n  his bridge, as ambassadors from some foreign prince. With that,\r\n  quoth the Cardinal, ‘I shall desire you, _because ye can speak\r\n  French_, to take the pains to go down into the hall to encounter\r\n  and to receive them, according to their estates, and to conduct\r\n  them into this chamber’ (_Cavendish_, p. 51). Then spake my Lord\r\n  Chamberlain unto them _in French_, declaring my Lord Cardinal’s\r\n  mind (p. 53).”\r\n\r\nThe general[21] opinion of our gentry as to the study of Letters, before\r\nand about 1500 A.D., is probably well represented by the opinion of one\r\nof them stated by Pace, in his Prefatory Letter to Colet, prefixed to\r\nthe former’s _De Fructu_[22].\r\n\r\n  It remains that I now explain to you what moves me to compile and\r\n  publish a treatise with this title. When, two years ago, more or\r\n  less, I had returned to my native land from the city of Rome,\r\n  I was present at a certain feast, a stranger to many; where, when\r\n  enough had been drunk, one or other of the guests--no fool, as one\r\n  might infer from his words and countenance--began to talk of\r\n  educating his children well. And, first of all, he thought that he\r\n  must search out a good teacher for them, and that they should at\r\n  any rate attend school. There happened to be present one of those\r\n  whom we call gentle-men (_generosos_), and who always carry some\r\n  horn hanging at their backs, as though they would hunt during\r\n  dinner. He, hearing letters praised, roused with sudden anger,\r\n  burst out furiously with these words. “Why do you talk nonsense,\r\n  friend?” he said; “A curse on those stupid letters! all learned\r\n  men are beggars: even Erasmus, the most learned of all, is a\r\n  beggar (as I hear), and in a certain letter of his calls τήν\r\n  κατάρατον πενίαν (that is, execrable poverty) his wife, and\r\n  vehemently complains that he cannot shake her off his shoulders\r\n  right into βαθυκήτεα πόντον, that is, into the deep sea. I swear\r\n  by God’s body I’d rather that my son should hang than study\r\n  letters. For it becomes the sons of gentlemen to blow the horn\r\n  nicely (_apte_), to hunt skilfully, and elegantly carry and train\r\n  a hawk. But the study of letters should be left to the sons of\r\n  rustics.” At this point I could not restrain myself from answering\r\n  something to this most talkative man, in defence of good letters.\r\n  “You do not seem to me, good man,” I said, “to think rightly. For\r\n  if any foreigner were to come to the king, such as the ambassadors\r\n  (_oratores_) of princes are, and an answer had to be given to him,\r\n  your son, if he were educated as you wish, could only blow his\r\n  horn, and the learned sons of rustics would be called to answer,\r\n  and would be far preferred to your hunter or fowler son; and they,\r\n  enjoying their learned liberty, would say to your face, ‘We prefer\r\n  to be learned, and, thanks to our learning, no fools, than boast\r\n  of our fool-like nobility.’ “Then he upon this, looking round,\r\n  said, “Who is this person that is talking like this? I don’t know\r\n  the fellow.” And when some one whispered in his ear who I was, he\r\n  muttered something or other in a low voice to himself; and finding\r\n  a fool to listen to him, he then caught hold of a cup of wine. And\r\n  when he could get nothing to answer, he began to drink, and change\r\n  the conversation to other things. And thus I was freed from the\r\n  disputing of this mad fellow,--which I was dreadfully afraid would\r\n  have lasted a long time,--not by Apollo, like Horace was from his\r\n  babbler, but by Bacchus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: APPRENTICESHIP IN HENRY VII.’S TIME.]\r\n\r\nOn the general subject it should be noted that Fleta mentions nothing\r\nabout boarders or apprentices in his account of household economy; nor\r\ndoes the _Liber Contrarotulatoris Garderobæ Edw. I^mi_ mention any\r\nyoung noblemen as part of the King’s household. That among tradesmen\r\nin later times, putting out their children in other houses, and\r\napprenticeships, were the rule, we know from many statements and\r\nallusions in our literature, and “The Italian Relation of England”\r\n(temp. Hen. VII.) mentions that the Duke of Suffolk was boarded out to\r\na rich old widow, who persuaded him to marry her (p. 27). It also says\r\n\r\n  The want of affection in the English is strongly manifested\r\n  towards their children; for after having kept them at home till\r\n  they arrive at the age of 7 or 9 years at the utmost, they put\r\n  them out, both males and females, to hard service in the houses of\r\n  other people, binding them generally for another 7 or 9 years. And\r\n  these are called apprentices, and during that time they perform\r\n  all the most menial offices; and few are born who are exempted\r\n  from this fate, for every one, however rich he may be, sends away\r\n  his children into the houses of others, whilst he, in return,\r\n  receives those of strangers into his own. And on inquiring their\r\n  reason for this severity, they answered that they did it in order\r\n  that their children might learn better manners. But I, for my\r\n  part, believe that they do it because they like to enjoy all their\r\n  comforts themselves, and that they are better served by strangers\r\n  than they would be by their own children. Besides which, the\r\n  English being great epicures, and very avaricious by nature,\r\n  indulge in the most delicate fare themselves and give their\r\n  household the coarsest bread, and beer, and cold meat baked on\r\n  Sunday for the week, which, however, they allow them in great\r\n  abundance. That if they had their own children at home, they would\r\n  be obliged to give them the same food they made use of for\r\n  themselves. That if the English sent their children away from home\r\n  to learn virtue and good manners, and took them back again when\r\n  their apprenticeship was over, they might, perhaps, be excused;\r\n  but they never return, for the girls are settled by their patrons,\r\n  and the boys make the best marriages they can, and, assisted by\r\n  their patrons, not by their fathers, they also open a house and\r\n  strive diligently by this means to make some fortune for\r\n  themselves; whence it proceeds that, having no hope of their\r\n  paternal inheritance, that all become so greedy of gain that they\r\n  feel no shame in asking, almost “for the love of God,” for the\r\n  smallest sums of money; and to this it may be attributed, that\r\n  there is no injury that can be committed against the lower orders\r\n  of the English, that may not be atoned for by money. --_A Relation\r\n  of the Island of England_ (Camden Society, 1847), pp. 24-6.\r\n\r\n“This evidently refers to tradesmen.[23] The note by the Editor[24]\r\nhowever says it was the case with the children of the first nobility,\r\nand gives the terms for the Duke of Buckingham’s children with Mrs\r\nHexstall. The document only shows that Mrs Hexstall boarded them by\r\ncontract ‘during the time of absence of my Lord and my Ladie.’”\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Essex says in a letter to Lord Burleigh, 1576, printed in\r\nMurdin’s _State Papers_, p. 301-2.\r\n\r\n  “Neverthelesse, uppon the assured Confidence, that your love to me\r\n  shall dissend to my Childrenne, and that your Lordship will\r\n  declare yourself a Frend to me, both alive and dead, I have willed\r\n  Mr _Waterhouse_ to shew unto you how you may with Honor and Equity\r\n  do good to my Sonne _Hereford_, and how to bind him with perpetual\r\n  Frendship to you and your House. And to the Ende I wold have his\r\n  Love towardes those which are dissended from you spring up and\r\n  increase with his Yeares, I have wished his Education to be in\r\n  your Household, though the same had not bene allotted to your\r\n  Lordship as Master of the Wardes; and that the whole Tyme, which\r\n  he shold spend in _England_ in his Minority, might be devided in\r\n  Attendance uppon my Lord _Chamberlayne_ and you, to the End, that\r\n  as he might frame himself to the Example of my Lord of _Sussex_ in\r\n  all the Actions of his Life, tending either to the Warres, or to\r\n  the Institution of a Nobleman, so that he might also reverence\r\n  your Lordship for your Wisdome and Gravyty, and lay up your\r\n  Counsells and Advises in the Treasory of his Hart.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: GIRLS SENT OUT TO LADIES’ HOUSES.]\r\n\r\nThat girls, as well as boys, were sent out to noblemen’s houses for\r\ntheir education, is evident from Margaret Paston’s letter of the 3rd of\r\nApril, 1469, to Sir John Paston, “Also I would ye should purvey for your\r\nsister [? Margery] to be with my Lady of Oxford, or with my Lady of\r\nBedford, or in some other worshipful place whereas ye think best, and I\r\nwill help to her finding, for we be either of us weary of other.” Alice\r\nCrane’s Letter, in the Paston Letters, v. i. p. 35, ed. 1840, also\r\nsupports this view, as does Sir John Heveningham’s to Margaret Paston,\r\nasking her to take his cousin Anneys Loveday for some time as a boarder\r\ntill a mistress could be found for her. “If that it please you to have\r\nher with you to into the time that a mistress may be purveyed for her,\r\nI pray you thereof, and I shall content you for her board that ye shall\r\nbe well pleased.” Similarly Anne Boleyn and her sister were sent to\r\nMargaret of Savoy, aunt of Charles V., who lived at Brussels, to learn\r\ncourtesy, &c., says Prof. Brewer. Sir Roger Twysden says that Anne was\r\n“Not above seven yeares of age, Anno 1514,” when she went abroad. He\r\nadds:\r\n\r\n  “It should seeme by some that she served three in France\r\n  successively; Mary of England maryed to Lewis the twelfth, an.\r\n  1514, with whome she went out of England, but Lewis dying the\r\n  first of January following, and that Queene (being) to returne\r\n  home, sooner than either Sir Thomas Bullen or some other of her\r\n  frendes liked she should, she was preferred to Clauda, daughter to\r\n  Lewis XII. and wife to Francis I. then Queene (it is likely upon\r\n  the commendation of Mary the Dowager), who not long after dying,\r\n  an. 1524, not yet weary of France she went to live with\r\n  Marguerite, Dutchess of Alançon and Berry, a Lady much commended\r\n  for her favor towards good letters, but never enough for the\r\n  Protestant religion then in the infancy--from her, if I am not\r\n  deceived, she first learnt the grounds of the Protestant religion;\r\n  so that England may seem to owe some part of her happyness derived\r\n  from that Lady.” (Twysden’s Notes quoted by Singer in his ed. of\r\n  Cavendish’s Life of Wolsey, 1825, p. 57.)\r\n\r\nAs Henry VIII. fell in love with his wife’s maid of honour,--“began to\r\nkindle the brand of amours” at the light of Anne Boleyn’s beauty, “her\r\nexcellent gesture and behaviour,”--so we find in later times rich young\r\nmen became enamoured of poor young women staying in the same house with\r\nthem. Mr Bruce sends me an instance:\r\n\r\n  “the young lady was niece, you will perceive, to a well-beneficed\r\n  clergyman, and a thriving gentleman well-advanced in the public\r\n  service. She had lost her mother, and her father was in debt and\r\n  difficulties. She was therefore placed by the influence of her\r\n  uncles in a well-known family in Wiltshire.”\r\n\r\n  _State Papers.

She told me much accordinge to what she had sayd unto my\r\n  coson Hunton, w{i}th this addition, that she had respect in it as\r\n  well unto her good as her owne convenience, for hauinge nowe noe\r\n  employment for her but her needle, she founde that sittinge still\r\n  at her worke made her sickly, and therefore thought she might doe\r\n  better in another seruice where she might haue the orderinge of an\r\n  huswifely charge, for w{hi}ch (she told me) she had made her very\r\n  able. I expressed myselfe tender of the disgrace w{hi}ch would lay\r\n  uppon my coson in beinge displaced in such a manner by warninge\r\n  giuen, wherof whatsoeuer were the cause, it would be imagined by\r\n  all that knowe it not, to be in her ill carriage, and wished she\r\n  had done me that fauour as to haue acquainted me with her intents\r\n  in such time as I might haue taken some course to haue disposed of\r\n  her before it had bin knowne that she was to leaue her: she\r\n  slubbered it ouer w{i}th a slight excuse that she had acquainted\r\n  my wife ... but for my satisfaction she told me that she would be\r\n  as mindfull of her when God should call her as if she were w{i}th\r\n  her, and in testimony of her good likinge of her seruice she would\r\n  allowe her forty shillings yearly towarde her maintainance as\r\n  longe as herself should liue.

Prevost.\r\n\r\nFrom Adam de Marisco’s Letters, 53, we find that Henry and Almeric, the\r\neldest and youngest sons of the Earl of Montfort, were put under\r\nGrosseteste for tuition, he being then a Bishop. At Paris, John of\r\nSalisbury (who died in 1180) gained a living by teaching the sons of\r\nnoblemen,--(_instruendos susceperam_, ? took them in to board).\r\n--_Metalogicus_, lib. 11, c. 10.\r\n\r\nHenry of Huntingdon says, “Richard, the king’s (Henry I.’s) bastard son,\r\nwas honourably brought up (_festive nutritus_) by our Bishop Robert\r\n(Blote of Lincoln), and duly reverenced by me and others in the same\r\nhousehold I lived in.” --_Anglia Sacra_, vol. ii. p. 696. Giraldus\r\nCambrensis speaks of beating his _coætanei et conscolares terræ suæ_, of\r\nbeing reproved for idleness by his uncle, the Bishop of St David’s, and\r\nof being constantly chaffed by two of his uncle’s chaplains, who used to\r\ndecline _durus_ and _stultus_ to him. Also he alludes to the rod.\r\nProbably there was some sort of school at either Pembroke or St\r\nDavid’s[[24a]].--_De Rebus a se Gestis_, lib. 1, c. 2.[25]\r\n\r\nThe Statutes of a Gild of young Scholars formed to burn lights in honour\r\nof some saint or other, and to help one another in sickness, old age,\r\nand to burial, will be printed for us by Mr Toulmin Smith in the Early\r\nEnglish Text Society’s books this year.\r\n\r\nUnder this head of Private Tuition we may class the houses of Abbots,\r\nwhere boys of good birth were educated. In his History of English\r\nPoetry, section 36, vol. iii. p. 9, ed. 1840, Warton says:\r\n\r\n  “It appears to have been customary for the governors of the most\r\n  considerable convents, especially those that were honoured with\r\n  the mitre, to receive into their own private lodgings the sons of\r\n  the principal families of the neighbourhood for education. About\r\n  the year 1450, Thomas Bromele, abbot of the mitred monastery of\r\n  Hyde near Winchester, entertained in his own abbatial house within\r\n  that monastery eight young gentlemen, or _gentiles pueri_, who\r\n  were placed there for the purpose of literary instruction, and\r\n  constantly dined at the abbot’s table. I will not scruple to give\r\n  the original words, which are more particular and expressive, of\r\n  the obscure record which preserves this curious anecdote of\r\n  monastic life. ‘_Pro octo gentilibus pueris apud dominum abbatem\r\n  studii causa perhendinantibus, et ad mensam domini victitantibus,\r\n  cum garcionibus suis ipsos comitantibus, hoc anno_, xvii_l._ ixs.\r\n  _Capiendo pro_[26]...’” This, by the way, was more extraordinary,\r\n  as William of Wykeham’s celebrated seminary was so near. And this\r\n  seems to have been an established practice of the abbot of\r\n  Glastonbury, “whose apartment in the abbey was a kind of\r\n  well-disciplined court, where the sons of noblemen and young\r\n  gentlemen were wont to be sent for virtuous education, who\r\n  returned thence home excellently accomplished.[27]” Richard\r\n  Whiting, the last abbot of Glastonbury, who was cruelly executed\r\n  by the king, during the course of his government educated near\r\n  three hundred ingenuous youths, who constituted a part of his\r\n  family; beside many others whom he liberally supported at the\r\n  universities.[28] Whitgift, the most excellent and learned\r\n  archbishop of Canterbury in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was\r\n  educated under Robert Whitgift his uncle, abbot of the Augustine\r\n  monastery of black canons at Wellhow in Lincolnshire, “who,” says\r\n  Strype, “had several other young gentlemen under his care for\r\n  education.” (Strype’s Whitgift, v. i. ch. i. p. 3.)\r\n\r\nOf Lydgate--about 1420-30 A.D. I suppose--Prof. Morley says in his\r\n_English Writers_, vol. ii. Pt. I. p. 423:\r\n\r\n  “After studying at Oxford, Paris, and Padua, and after mastering\r\n  with special delight the writings of such poets as Dante,\r\n  Boccaccio, and Alain Chartier, Lydgate opened at his monastery of\r\n  Bury St Edmund’s a school of rhetoric in which he taught young\r\n  nobles literature and the art of versifying!”\r\n\r\nRichard Pace says in his _De Fructu_, 1517:\r\n\r\n  “Now the learning of music too demands its place, especially from\r\n  me whom it distinguished when a boy amongst boys. For Thomas\r\n  Langton, bishop of Winchester (the predecessor of him who is now\r\n  living), whose secretary I was, when he had marked that I was\r\n  making a proficiency in music far beyond my age (as\r\n  himself--perchance from his too great affection for me--would\r\n  point out and repeatedly say), ‘The talent of this lad,’ he said,\r\n  ‘is born for greater things,’ and a few days afterwards he sent\r\n  me, to pursue the study of literature, into Italy, to the school\r\n  at Padua, which then was at its greatest prime, and benevolently\r\n  supplied the annual expenses, as he showed wonderful favour to all\r\n  men of letters, and in his day played the part of a second\r\n  Mecænas, well remembering (as he ofttimes said) that he had been\r\n  advanced to the episcopal dignity on account of his learning. For\r\n  he had gained, with the highest commendation, the distinctions of\r\n  each law[29] (as they say now-a-days). Also he so highly prized\r\n  the study of Humanity[30] that he had boys and youths instructed\r\n  in it at a school in his house; And he was vastly delighted to\r\n  hear the scholars repeat to him at night the lessons given them by\r\n  the teacher during the day. In this competition he who had borne\r\n  himself notably went away with a present of something suitable to\r\n  his character, and with commendation expressed in the most refined\r\n  language; for that excellent governor had ever in his mouth the\r\n  maxim that merit grows with praise.”[31]\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: EDUCATION AT HOME AND AT TUTORS’.]\r\n\r\nPalsgrave in 1530 speaks of “maister Petrus Vallensys, scole maister\r\nto his [Charles, Duke of Suffolk’s] excellent yong sonne the Erle of\r\nLyncolne.”\r\n\r\nRoger Ascham, author of the _Scholemaster_, &c., born in 1515,\r\n\r\n  “was received at a very youthful age into the family of Sir Antony\r\n  Wingfield, who furnished money for his education, and placed\r\n  Roger, together with his own sons, under a tutor whose name was\r\n  Bond. The boy had by nature a taste for books, and showed his good\r\n  taste by reading English in preference to Latin, with wonderful\r\n  eagerness. This was the more remarkable from the fact that Latin\r\n  was still the language of literature, and it is not likely that\r\n  the few English books written at that time were at all largely\r\n  spread abroad in places far away from the Universities and\r\n  Cathedral towns. In or about the year 1530, Mr Bond the domestic\r\n  tutor resigned the charge of young Roger, who was now about\r\n  fifteen years old, and by the advice and pecuniary aid of his kind\r\n  patron Sir Antony, he was enabled to enter St John’s College,\r\n  Cambridge, at that time the most famous seminary of learning in\r\n  all England ... he took his bachelor’s degree in 1531, Feb. 18, in\r\n  the 18th year of his age [“being a boy, new bachelor of art,” he\r\n  says himself,] a time of life at which it is now more common to\r\n  enter the University than to take a degree, but which, according\r\n  to the modes of education then in use, was not thought premature.\r\n  On the 23rd of March following, he was elected fellow of the\r\n  College.” Giles’s Life of Ascham, Works, vol. i. p. xi-xiv.\r\n\r\nDr Clement and his wife were brought up in Sir T.

HEN. VIII. AND ELIZABETH.]\r\n\r\nOf the course of study of ‘well-bred youths’ in the early years of\r\nElizabeth’s reign we have an interesting account by Sir Nicholas Bacon,\r\nLord Keeper, father of the great Bacon, in a Paper by Mr J. Payne\r\nCollier in the _Archæologia_, vol. 36, Part 2, p. 339, Article xxxi.[33]\r\n“Before he became Lord Keeper, Sir Nicholas Bacon had been Attorney of\r\nthat Court” [the Court of Wards and Liveries] “a most lucrative\r\nappointment; and on the 27th May, 1561, he addressed a letter to Sir\r\nWilliam Cecil, then recently (Jan., 1561) made Master of the Wards,\r\nfollowed by a paper thus entitled:--’Articles devised for the bringing\r\nup in vertue and learning of the Queenes Majesties Wardes, being heires\r\nmales, and whose landes, descending in possession and coming to the\r\nQueenes Majestie, shall amount to the cleere yearly value of c. markes,\r\nor above.’” Sir Nicholas asks the new Master of Wards to reform what he\r\njustly calls most “preposterous” abuses in the department:--“That the\r\nproceeding hath bin preposterous, appeareth by this: the chiefe thinge,\r\nand most of price, in wardeship, is the wardes mynde; the next to that,\r\nhis bodie; the last and meanest, his land. Nowe, hitherto the chiefe\r\ncare of governaunce hath bin to the land, being the meaneste; and to the\r\nbodie, being the better, very small; but to the mynde, being the best,\r\nnone at all, which methinkes is playnely to sett the carte before the\r\nhorse” (p. 343). Mr Collier then summarises Bacon’s Articles for the\r\nbringing up of the Wards thus: “The wards are to attend divine service\r\nat six in the morning: nothing is said about breakfast,[34] but they are\r\nto study Latin until eleven; to dine between 11 and 12; to study with\r\nthe music-master from 12 till 2; from 2 to 3 they are to be with the\r\nFrench master; and from 3 to 5 with the Latin and Greek masters. At 5\r\nthey are to go to evening prayers; then they are to sup; to be allowed\r\nhonest pastimes till 8; and, last of all, before they go to bed at 9,\r\nthey are again to apply themselves to music under the instruction of the\r\nmaster. At and after the age of 16 they were to attend lectures upon\r\ntemporal and civil law, as well as _de disciplinâ militari_. It is not\r\nnecessary to insert farther details; but what I have stated will serve\r\nto show how well-bred youths of that period were usually brought up, and\r\nhow disgracefully the duty of education as regards wards was\r\nneglected.... It may appear singular that in these articles drawn up by\r\nSir Nicholas, so much stress is laid upon instruction in music[35]; but\r\nit only serves to confirm the notion that the science was then most\r\nindustriously cultivated by nearly every class of society.” Pace in 1517\r\nrequires that every one should study it, but should join with it some\r\nother study, as Astrology or Astronomy. He says also that the greatest\r\npart of the art had perished by men’s negligence; “For all that our\r\nmusicians do now-a-days, is almost trivial if compared with what the old\r\nones (_antiqui_) did, so that now hardly one or two (_unus aut alter_)\r\ncan be found who know what harmony is, though the word is always on\r\ntheir tongue.” (_De Fructu_, p. 54-5.) Ascham, while lamenting in 1545\r\n(_Toxophilus_, p. 29) ‘that the laudable custom of England to teach\r\nchildren their plain song and prick-song’ is ‘so decayed throughout all\r\nthe realm as it is,’ denounces the great practise of instrumental music\r\nby older students: “the minstrelsy of lutes, pipes, harps, and all other\r\nthat standeth by such nice, fine, minikin fingering, (such as the most\r\npart of scholars whom I know use, if they use any,) is far more fit, for\r\nthe womanishness of it, to dwell in the Court among ladies, than for any\r\ngreat thing in it which should help good and sad study, to abide in the\r\nUniversity among scholars.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: NEGLECT OF EDUCATION BY MOTHERS.]\r\n\r\nBy 1577 our rich people, according to Harrison, attended properly to the\r\neducation of their children. After speaking “of our women, whose beautie\r\ncommonlie exceedeth the fairest of those of the maine,” he says:\r\n\r\n  “This neuerthelesse I vtterlie mislike in the poorer sort of them,\r\n  for the wealthier doo sildome offend herein: that being of\r\n  themselues without competent wit, they are so carelesse in the\r\n  education of their children (wherein their husbands also are to be\r\n  blamed,) by means whereof verie manie of them neither fearing God,\r\n  neither regarding either manners or obedience, do oftentimes come\r\n  to confusion, which (if anie correction or discipline had beene\r\n  vsed toward them in youth) might haue prooued good members of\r\n  their common-wealth & countrie, by their good seruice and\r\n  industrie.” --_Descr. of Britaine_, Holinshed, i. 115, col. 2.\r\n\r\nThis is borne out by Ascham, who says that young men up to 17 were well\r\nlooked after, but after that age were turned loose to get into all the\r\nmischief they liked:\r\n\r\n  “In deede, from seven to seventene, yong jentlemen commonlie be\r\n  carefullie enough brought up: But from seventene to seven and\r\n  twentie (the most dangerous tyme of all a mans life, and most\r\n  slipperie to stay well in) they have commonlie the rein of all\r\n  licens in their owne hand, and speciallie soch as do live in the\r\n  Court. And that which is most to be merveled at, commonlie the\r\n  wisest and also best men be found the fondest fathers in this\r\n  behalfe. And if som good father wold seek some remedie herein, yet\r\n  the mother (if the household of our Lady) had rather, yea, and\r\n  will to, have her sonne cunnyng and bold, in making him to lyve\r\n  trimlie when he is yong, than by learning and travell to be able\r\n  to serve his Prince & his countrie, both wiselie in peace, and\r\n  stoutlie in warre, whan he is old.\r\n\r\n  “The fault is in your selves, ye noble mens sonnes, and therfore\r\n  ye deserve the greater blame, that commonlie the meaner mens\r\n  children cum to be the wisest councellours, and greatest doers, in\r\n  the weightie affaires of this realme.” --_Scholemaster_, ed. Mayor,\r\n  p. 39-40.\r\n\r\nNote lastly, on this subject of private tuition, that Mulcaster in his\r\n_Elementarie_, 1582, complains greatly of rich people aping the custom\r\nof princes in having private tutors for their boys, and withdrawing them\r\nfrom public schools where the spirit of emulation against other boys\r\nwould make them work. The course he recommends is, that rich people\r\nshould send their sons, with their tutors, to the public schools, and so\r\nget the advantage of both kinds of tuition.\r\n\r\n_Girls’ Home Education._ The earliest notice of an English Governess\r\nthat any friend has found for me is in “the 34th Letter of Osbert de\r\nClare in Stephen’s reign, A.D. 1135-54. He mentions what seems to be a\r\nGoverness of his children, ‘_quædam matrona quæ liberos ejus_ (sc.\r\n_militis, Herberti de Furcis_) _educare consueverat_.’ She appears to be\r\ntreated as one of the family: e.g. they wait for her when she goes into\r\na chapel to pray. I think a nurse would have been ‘ancilla quæ liberos\r\nejus nutriendos susceperat.’” Walter de Biblesworth was the tutor of the\r\n“lady Dionysia de Monchensi, a Kentish heiress, the daughter of William\r\nde Monchensi, baron of Swanescombe, and related, apparently,[[35a]] to\r\nthe Valences, earls of Pembroke, and wrote his French Grammar, or rather\r\nVocabulary[36], for her. She married Hugh de Vere, the second son of\r\nRobert, fifth earl of Oxford. (Wright.) Lady Jane Grey was taught by a\r\ntutor at home, as we have seen. Palsgrave was tutor to Henry VIII.’s\r\n“most dere and most entirely beloved suster, quene Mary, douagier of\r\nFrance,” and no doubt wrote his _Lesclaircissement de la Langue\r\nFrancoise_ mainly for her, though also “desirous to do some humble\r\nservice unto the nobilitie of this victorious realme, and universally\r\nunto all other estates of this my natyfe country.” Giles Du Guez, or as\r\nPalsgrave says to Henry VIII., “the synguler clerke, maister Gyles\r\nDewes, somtyme instructor to your noble grace in this selfe tong, at the\r\nespeciall instaunce and request of dyvers of your highe estates and\r\nnoble men, hath also for his partye written in this matter.” His book is\r\nentitled “An Introductorie for to lerne to rede, to pronounce & to speke\r\nFrench trewly: compyled for the Right high, excellent, and most vertuous\r\nlady The Lady Mary of Englande, doughter to our most gracious soverayn\r\nLorde Kyng Henry the Eight.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: UNIVERSITY EDUCATION IN EARLY ENGLAND.]\r\n\r\n3. _English University Education._ In early days Cambridge and Oxford\r\nmust be looked on, I suppose, as mainly the great schools for boys, and\r\nthe generality of scholars as poor men’s children,[37] like Chaucer’s\r\n‘poore scolares tuo that dwelten in the soler-halle of Cantebregge,’ his\r\nClerk of Oxenford, and those students, gifts to whom are considered as\r\none of the regular burdens on the husbandman, in “God speed the Plough.”\r\nMr Froude says, Hist. of England, I. 37:\r\n\r\n  “The universities were well filled, by the sons of yeomen chiefly.\r\n  The cost of supporting them at the colleges was little, and\r\n  wealthy men took a pride in helping forward any boys of\r\n  promise[38] (_Latimer’s Sermons_, p. 64). It seems clear also, as\r\n  the Reformation drew nearer, while the clergy were sinking lower\r\n  and lower, a marked change for the better became perceptible in a\r\n  portion at least of the laity.”\r\n\r\nBut Grosseteste mentions a “noble” scholar at Oxford (_Epist._ 129), and\r\nEdward the Black Prince and Henry V. are said to have been students of\r\nQueen’s College, Oxford. Wolsey himself was a College tutor at Oxford,\r\nand had among his pupils the sons of the Marquess of Dorset, who\r\nafterwards gave him his first preferment, the living of Lymington.\r\n(Chappell.) [[38a]]\r\n\r\nThe legend runs that the first school at Oxford was founded by King\r\nAlfred[39], and that Oxford was a place of study in the time of Edward\r\nthe Confessor (1041-66). If one may quote a book now considered to be ‘a\r\nmonkish forgery and an exploded authority,’ Ingulfus, who was Abbot of\r\nCroyland, in the Isle of Ely, under William the Conqueror, says of\r\nhimself that he was educated first at Westminster, and then passed to\r\nOxford, where he made proficiency in such books of Aristotle as were\r\nthen accessible to students,[40] and in the first two books of Tully’s\r\nRhetoric.--_Malden_, On the Origin of Universities, 1835, p. 71.\r\n\r\nIn 1201 Oxford is called a _University_, and said to have contained 3000\r\nscholars; in 1253 its first College (University) is founded. In 1244,\r\nHen. III. grants it its first privileges as a corporate body, and\r\nconfirms and extends them in 1245. In his reign, Wood says the number of\r\nscholars amounted to 30,000, a number no doubt greatly exaggerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: POVERTY OF UNIVERSITY SCHOLARS.]\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Stephen, we know that Vacarius, a Lombard by birth, who\r\nhad studied the civil law at Bologna, came into England, and formed a\r\nschool of law at Oxford[41] ... he remained in England in the reign of\r\nHenry II. On account of the difficulty and expense of obtaining copies\r\nof the original books of the Roman law, and _the poverty of his English\r\nscholars_, Vacarius [ab. 1149, A.D.] compiled an abridgment of the\r\nDigests and Codex, in which their most essential parts were preserved,\r\nwith some difference of arrangement, and illustrated from other\r\nlaw-books.... It bore on its title that it was “_pauperibus presertim\r\ndestinatus_;” and hence the Oxford students of law obtained the name of\r\n_Pauperists._--_Malden_, p. 72-3.\r\n\r\nRoger Bacon (who died 1248)[[41a]] speaks of a young fellow who came to\r\nhim, aged 15, not having wherewithal to live, or finding proper masters:\r\n“because he was obliged to serve those who gave him necessaries, during\r\ntwo years found no one to teach him a word in the things he learned.”\r\n--_Opus Tertium_, cap. xx. In 1214 the Commonalty of Oxford agreed to\r\npay 52s. yearly for the use of poor scholars, and to give 100 of them a\r\nmeal of bread, ale, and pottage, with one large dish of flesh or fish,\r\nevery St Nicholas day.--_Wood’s An._ i. 185. _Wood’s Annals_ (ed. Gutch,\r\nv. i. p. 619-20) also notes that in 1461 A.D. divers Scholars were\r\nforced to get a license under the Chancellor’s hand and seal (according\r\nto the Stat. 12 Ric. II., A.D. 1388, _Ib._, p. 519) to beg: and Sir\r\nThos. More says “then may wee yet, like poor Scholars of Oxford, go a\r\nbegging with our baggs & wallets, & sing salve Regina at rich mens\r\ndores.” On this point we may also compare the Statutes of Walter de\r\nMerton for his College at Oxford, A.D. 1274, ed. Halliwell, 1843, p. 19:\r\n\r\n  Cap. 13.

The\r\nscholars who attended the public lectures of the university, without\r\nentering themselves at any college or hall, were called _chamber\r\ndekyns_, as in Paris they were called martinets; and frequent enactments\r\nwere made against them.--_Malden_, p. 85, ref. to _Woods Annals_, 1408,\r\n-13, -22, and 1512, &c.\r\n\r\nThe following are the dates of the foundations of the different Colleges\r\nat Oxford as given in the University Calendar:--\r\n\r\n  University College,        1253-80[42]\r\n  Balliol Coll.,   betw. 1263 & 1268\r\n  Merton College, founded at\r\n    Maldon, in Surrey, in\r\n    1264, removed to Oxford\r\n    in                          1274\r\n  Exeter College                1314\r\n  Oriel   „                     1326\r\n  The Queen’s College           1340\r\n  New           „               1386\r\n  Lincoln       „               1427\r\n  All Souls     „               1437\r\n  Magdalen      „               1458\r\n  The King’s Hall and    }\r\n    College of Brasenose }      1509\r\n  Corpus Christi College        1516\r\n  Christ Church    „            1526\r\n  Trinity College               1554\r\n  St John’s    „                1555\r\n  Jesus        „                1571\r\n  Wadham       „                1613\r\n  Pembroke     „                1624\r\n  Worcester    „                1714\r\n\r\nHALLS\r\n\r\n  St Edmund Hall      1317\r\n  St Mary’s  „        1333\r\n  New Inn    „        1438\r\n  Magdalen   „        1487\r\n  St Alban   „  after 1547\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: UNDERGRADUATE’S EXPENSES AT OXFORD, 1478.]\r\n\r\n‘The Paston Letters’ do not give us much information about studies or\r\nlife at Oxford, but they do give us material for estimating the cost of\r\na student there (ii. 124[43]); they show us the tutor reporting to a\r\nmother her son’s progress in learning (ii. 130), and note the custom of\r\na man, when made bachelor, giving a feast: “I was made bachelor ... on\r\nFriday was se’nnight (18 June, 1479), and I made my feast on the Monday\r\nafter (21 June). I was promised venison against my feast, of my Lady\r\nHarcourt, and of another person too, but I was deceived of both; but my\r\nguests held them pleased with such meat as they had, blessed be God.”\r\nThe letter as to the costs is dated May 19, 1478.\r\n\r\n  “I marvel sore that you sent me no word of the letter which I sent\r\n  to you by Master William Brown at Easter. I sent you word that\r\n  time that I should send you mine expenses particularly; but as at\r\n  this time the bearer hereof had a letter suddenly that he should\r\n  come home, & therefore I could have no leisure to send them to you\r\n  on that wise, & therefore I shall write to you in this letter the\r\n  whole sum of my expenses since I was with you till Easter last\r\n  past, and also the receipts, reckoning the twenty shillings that I\r\n  had of you to Oxon wards, with the bishop’s finding:--\r\n\r\n                                                      £   s.  d.\r\n    The whole sum of receipts is                      5  17   6\r\n    And the whole sum of expenses is                  6   5   5¾\r\n    And that [= what] cometh over my receipts\r\n      & my expenses I have borrowed of Master Edmund,\r\n      & it draweth to                                     8   0\r\n\r\n  and yet I reckon none expenses since Easter; but as for them, they\r\n  be not great.”\r\n\r\nOn this account Fenn says,\r\n\r\n  “he (Wm. Paston) had expended £6 5s. 5¾d. from the time he left\r\n  his mother to Easter last, which this year fell on the 22nd March,\r\n  from which time it was now two months, & of the expenses ‘since\r\n  incurred’ he says ‘they be not great.’ We may therefore conclude\r\n  the former account was from the Michaelmas preceding, and a\r\n  moderate one; if so, we may fairly estimate his university\r\n  education at £100 a-year of our present money. I mean that £12\r\n  10s. 11½d. would then procure as many necessaries and comforts as\r\n  £100 will at this day.”\r\n\r\nWhat was the basis of Fenn’s calculation he does not say. In 1468, the\r\nestimates for the Duke of Clarence’s household expenses give these\r\nprices, among others:\r\n\r\n                                      s.   d.           £    s.   d.\r\n  Wheat, a quarter                    6    0  now, say  3    0    0\r\n  Ale, a gallon                       -    1½    „      -    1    0\r\n  Beves, less hide and tallow, each  10    0     „     15    0    0[*]\r\n  Muttons      „         „            1    4     „      2   10    0[*]\r\n  Velys        „         „            2    6     „      4    0    0[*]\r\n  Porkes       „         „            2    0     „      5    0    0\r\n  Rice, a pound                            3     „                5\r\n  Sugar     „                              6     „                6\r\n  Holland, an ell (6d., 8d., 16d.)        10     „           1    3\r\n  Diapre                   „          4    6     „           3    0\r\n  Towelles                 „          1    8     „           1    6\r\n  Napkyns, a dozen, 12s., £1, £2,    17    4     „      2    0    0\r\n                                   ----------          -------------\r\n                                  £2  7    0½         £31   17    8\r\n\r\n                                                      [*: Poor ones.]\r\n\r\nThis sum would make the things named nearly 14 times as dear now as in\r\n1468, and raise Fenn’s £100 to about £180; but no reliance can be placed\r\non this estimate because we know nothing of the condition of the beves,\r\nmuttons, veles, and porkys, then, as contrasted with ours. Possibly they\r\nwere half the size and half the weight. Still, I have referred the\r\nquestion to Professor Thorold Rogers, author of the _History of Prices_\r\n1250-1400 A.D., and he says:\r\n\r\n  “In the year to which you refer (1478) bread was very dear, 50 per\r\n  cent. above the average. But on the whole, wheat prices in the\r\n  15th century were lower than in the 14th. Fenn’s calculation,\r\n  a little below the mark for wheat, is still less below it in most\r\n  of the second necessaries of life. The multiple of wheat is about\r\n  9, that of meat at least 24, those of butter and cheese nearly as\r\n  much. But that of clothing is not more than 6, that of linen from\r\n  4 to 5. Taking however one thing with another, 12 is a safe\r\n  general multiplier.”\r\n\r\nThis would make the cost of young Paston’s university education £150\r\n11s. 6d. a year.\r\n\r\nMr Whiston would raise Fenn’s estimate of £100 to £200. He says that\r\nthe rent of land in Kent in 1540 was a shilling or eighteenpence an\r\nacre,--see _Valor Ecclesiasticus_,--and that the tithes and glebes of\r\nthe Dean and Chapter of Rochester, which were worth about £480 a-year in\r\n1542, are now worth £19,000.\r\n\r\nThe remaining Oxford letter in the Paston volumes seems to allude to the\r\nstudents bearing part of the expenses of the degree, or the feast at it,\r\nof a person related to royal family.\r\n\r\n  “I supposed, when that I sent my letter to my brother John, that\r\n  the Queen’s brother should have proceeded at Midsummer, and\r\n  therefore I beseeched her to send me some money, _for it will be\r\n  some cost to me_, but not much.”\r\n\r\nThe first school at Cambridge is said to have been founded by Edward the\r\nElder, the son of Alfred, but on no good authority. In 1223 the term\r\n_University_ was applied to the place.

Tanner\r\nsays,\r\n\r\n  In our universities ... were taught divinity and canon law (then,\r\n  t. Hen. III., much in vogue), and the friers resorting thither in\r\n  great numbers and applying themselves closely to their studies,\r\n  outdid the monks in all fashionable knowledge. But the monks\r\n  quickly perceived it, and went also to the universities and\r\n  studied hard, that they might not be run down by the friers.[49]\r\n  And as the friers got houses in the universities, the monks also\r\n  got colleges founded and endowed there[50] for the education of\r\n  their novices, where they were for some years instructed in\r\n  grammar, philosophy, and school divinity, and then returning home,\r\n  improved their knowledge by their private studies, to the service\r\n  of God and the credit of their respective societies. So that a\r\n  little before the Reformation, the greatest part of the proceeders\r\n  in divinity at Oxford were monks and Regular canons.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: FAVOURITISM OF THE RICH IN THE UNIVERSITIES.]\r\n\r\nBy Harrison’s time, A.D. 1577[51], rich men’s sons had not only pressed\r\ninto the Universities, but were scrooging poor men’s sons out of the\r\nendowments meant only for the poor, learning the lessons that Mr Whiston\r\nso well shows our Cathedral dignitaries have carried out with the\r\nstipends of their choristers, boys and men. “_Les gros poissons mangent\r\nles menus._ Pro. Poore men are (easily) supplanted by the rich, the\r\nweake by the strong, the meane by the mighty.”[52] (Cotgrave, u.\r\n_manger_.) The law of “natural selection” prevails. Who shall say nay in\r\na Christian land professing the principles of the great “Inventor of\r\nPhilanthropy”? Whitgift for one, see his Life of Strype, Bk. I. chap.\r\nxiii. p. 148-50, ed. 1822. In 1589 an act 31 Eliz. c. 6, was passed to\r\nendeavour to prevent the abuse, but, like modern Election-bribery Acts\r\nwith their abuse, did not do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: BAD EXAMPLE OF RICH MEN AT COLLEGE.]\r\n\r\n  “at this present, of one sort & other, there are about three\r\n  thousand students nourished in them both (as by a late serveie it\r\n  manifestlie appeared). They [the Colleges at our Universities]\r\n  were created by their founders at the first, onelie for pore men’s\r\n  sons, whose parents were not able to bring them up unto learning:\r\n  but now they have the least benefit of them, by reason the rich do\r\n  so incroch upon them. And so farre hath this inconvenence spread\r\n  itself, that it is in my time an hard matter for a pore man’s\r\n  child to come by a fellowship (though he be neuer so good a\r\n  scholer & worthie of that roome.) Such packing also is used at\r\n  elections, that not he which best deserveth, but he that hath most\r\n  friends, though he be the worst scholer, is alwaies surest to\r\n  speed; which will turne in the end to the overthrow of learning.\r\n  That some gentlemen also, whose friends have been in times past\r\n  benefactors to certeine of those houses, doe intrude into the\r\n  disposition of their estates, without all respect of order or\r\n  statutes devised by the founders, onelie thereby to place whome\r\n  they think good (and not without some hope of gaine) the case is\r\n  too too evident, and their attempt would soone take place, if\r\n  their superiors did not provide to bridle their indevors. In some\r\n  grammar schooles likewise, which send scholers to these\r\n  universities, it is lamentable to see what briberie is used; for\r\n  yer the scholer can be preferred, such briberye is made, that pore\r\n  men’s children are commonly shut out, and the richer sort received\r\n  (who in times past thought it dishonour to live as it were upon\r\n  almes) and yet being placed, most of them studie little other than\r\n  histories, tables, dice & trifles, as men that make not the living\r\n  by their studie the end of their purposes; which is a lamentable\r\n  bearing. Besides this, being for the most part either gentlemen,\r\n  or rich men’s sonnes, they oft bring the universities into much\r\n  slander.[53] For standing upon their reputation and libertie, they\r\n  ruffle and roist it out, exceeding in apparell, and hanting\r\n  riotous companie (which draweth them from their bookes into an\r\n  other trade). And for excuse, when they are charged with breach of\r\n  all good order, thinke it sufficient to saie, that they be\r\n  gentlemen, which grieveth manie not a little. But to proceed with\r\n  the rest.\r\n\r\n  “Everie one of these colleges haue in like manner their professors\r\n  or readers of the tongs and severall sciences, as they call them,\r\n  which dailie trade up the youth there abiding privatlie in their\r\n  halles, to the end they may be able afterwards (when their turne\r\n  commeth about, which is after twelve termes) to show themselves\r\n  abroad, by going from thence into the common schooles and publike\r\n  disputations (as it were _In aream_) there to trie their skilles,\r\n  and declare how they have profited since their coming thither.\r\n\r\n  “Moreover in the publike schooles of both the universities, there\r\n  are found at the prince’s charge (and that verie largelie) five\r\n  professors & readers, that is to saie, of divinitie, of the civill\r\n  law, physicke, the Hebrew and the Greek tongues. And for the other\r\n  lectures, as of philosophie, logike, rhetorike and the\r\n  quadriuials, although the latter (I mean, arithmetike, musike,\r\n  geometrie and astronomie, and with them all skill in the\r\n  perspectives are now smallie regarded in either of them) the\r\n  universities themselves do allowe competent stipends to such as\r\n  reade the same, whereby they are sufficiently provided for,\r\n  touching the maintenance of their estates, and no less encouraged\r\n  to be diligent in their functions.”\r\n\r\nOn the introduction of the study of Greek into the Universities,\r\nDr S. Knight says in his _Life of Colet_:\r\n\r\n  “As for _Oxford_, its own _History_ and _Antiquities_ sufficiently\r\n  confess, that nothing was known there but _Latin_, and that in the\r\n  most depraved Style of the _School-men_. _Cornelius Vitellius_, an\r\n  _Italian_, was the first who taught _Greek_ in that\r\n  University[54]; and from him the famous _Grocyne_ learned the\r\n  first Elements thereof.\r\n\r\n  “In _Cambridge_, _Erasmus_ was the first who taught the _Greek\r\n  Grammar_. And so very low was the State of Learning in that\r\n  University, that (as he tells a Friend) about the Year 1485, the\r\n  Beginning of _Hen._ VII. Reign, there was nothing taught in that\r\n  publick Seminary besides _Alexander’s Parva Logicalia_, (as they\r\n  called them) the old _Axioms_ of _Aristotle_, and the _Questions_\r\n  of John Scotus, till in Process of time _good Letters_ were\r\n  brought in, and some Knowledge of the _Mathematicks_; as also\r\n  _Aristotle_ in a new Dress, and some Skill in the _Greek_ Tongue;\r\n  and, by Degrees, a Multitude of _Authors_, whose _Names_ before\r\n  had not been heard of.[55]\r\n\r\n  “It is certain that even _Erasmus_ himself did little understand\r\n  _Greek_, when he came first into _England_, in 1497 (13 _Hen._\r\n  VII.), and that our Countryman _Linacer_ taught it him, being just\r\n  returned from _Italy_ with great Skill in that Language: Which\r\n  _Linacer_ and _William Grocyne_ were the two only Tutors that were\r\n  able to teach it.” Saml. Knight, Life of Dr John Colet, pp.\r\n  17, 18.\r\n\r\nThe age at which boys went up to the University seems to have varied\r\ngreatly. When Oxford students were forbidden to play marbles they could\r\nnot have been very old. But in “The Mirror of the Periods of Man’s Life”\r\n(? ab. 1430 A.D.), in the Society’s _Hymns to the Virgin and Christ_ of\r\nthis year, we find the going-up age put at twenty:\r\n\r\n  Quod resou{n}, in age of .XX. ȝeer,\r\n    Goo to oxenford, or lerne lawe[56].\r\n\r\nThis is confirmed by young Paston’s being at Eton at nineteen (see\r\nbelow, p. lvi). In 1612, Brinsley (_Grammar Schoole_, p. 307) puts the\r\nage at fifteen, and says,\r\n\r\n  “such onely should be sent to the Vniuersities, who proue most\r\n  ingenuous and towardly, and who, in a loue of learning, will begin\r\n  to take paines of themselues, hauing attained in some sort the\r\n  former parts of learning; being good Grammarians at least, able to\r\n  vnderstand, write and speake Latine in good sort.\r\n\r\n  “Such as haue good discretion how to gouerne themselues there, and\r\n  to moderate their expenses; which is seldome times before 15\r\n  yeeres of age; which is also the youngest age admitted by the\r\n  statutes of the Vniuersity, as I take it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: FOREIGN UNIVERSITY EDUCATION.]\r\n\r\n4. _Foreign University Education._ That some of our nobles sent their\r\nsons to be educated in the French universities (whence they sometimes\r\nimported foreign vices into England[57]) is witnessed by some verses in\r\na Latin Poem “in MS. Digby, No. 4 (Bodleian Library) of the end of the\r\n13th or beginning of the 14th century,” printed by Mr Thomas Wright in\r\nhis _Anecdota Literaria_, p. 38.\r\n\r\n  Filii nobilium, dum sunt juniores,\r\n  Mittuntur in Franciam fieri doctores;\r\n  Quos prece vel pretio domant corruptores,\r\n  Sic prætaxatos referunt artaxata mores.\r\n\r\nAn English _nation_ or set of students of the Faculty of Arts at Paris\r\nexisted in 1169; after 1430 the name was changed to the German nation.\r\nBesides the students from the French provinces subject to the English,\r\nas Poictou, Guienne, &c, it included the English, Scottish, Irish,\r\nPoles, Germans, &c. --_Encyc. Brit._ John of Salisbury (born 1110) says\r\nthat he was twelve years studying at Paris on his own account. Thomas a\r\nBecket, as a young man, studied at Paris. Giraldus Cambrensis (born\r\n1147) went to Paris for education; so did Alexander Neckham (died 1227).\r\nHenry says,\r\n\r\n  “The English, in particular, were so numerous, that they occupied\r\n  several schools or colleges; and made so distinguished a figure by\r\n  their genius and learning, as well as by their generous manner of\r\n  living, that they attracted the notice of all strangers. This\r\n  appears from the following verses, describing the behaviour of a\r\n  stranger on his first arrival in Paris, composed by Negel Wircker,\r\n  an English student there, A.D. 1170:--\r\n\r\n    The stranger dress’d, the city first surveys,\r\n    A church he enters, to his God he prays.\r\n    Next to the schools he hastens, each he views,\r\n    With care examines, anxious which to chuse.\r\n    The English most attract his prying eyes,\r\n    Their manners, words, and looks, pronounce them wise.\r\n    Theirs is the open hand, the bounteous mind;\r\n    Theirs solid sense, with sparkling wit combin’d.\r\n    Their graver studies jovial banquets crown,\r\n    Their rankling cares in flowing bowls they drown.[58]\r\n\r\nMontpelier was another University whither Englishmen resorted, and is to\r\nbe remembered by us if only for the memory of Andrew Borde, M.D., some\r\nbits of whose quaintness are in the notes to Russell in the present\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nPadua is to be noted for Pace’s sake. He is supposed to have been born\r\nin 1482.\r\n\r\nLater, the custom of sending young noblemen and gentlemen to Italy--to\r\ntravel, not to take a degree--was introduced, and Ascham’s condemnation\r\nof it, when no tutor accompanied the youths, is too well known to need\r\nquoting. The Italians’ saying, _Inglese Italianato è un diabolo\r\nincarnato_, sums it up.[59]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: MONASTIC AND CATHEDRAL SCHOOLS.]\r\n\r\n5. _Monastic and Cathedral Schools._ Herbert Losing, Bp. of Thetford,\r\nafterwards Norwich, between 1091 and 1119, in his 37th Letter restores\r\nhis schools at Thetford to Dean Bund, and directs that no other schools\r\nbe opened there.\r\n\r\nTanner (_Not. Mon._ p. xx. ed. Nasmith), when mentioning “the use\r\nand advantage of these Religious houses”--under which term “are\r\ncomprehended, cathedral and collegiate churches, abbies, priories,\r\ncolleges, hospitals, preceptories (Knights Templars’ houses), and\r\nfrieries”--says,\r\n\r\n  “Secondly, They were schools of learning & education; for every\r\n  convent had one person or more appointed for this purpose; and all\r\n  the neighbours that desired it, might have their children taught\r\n  grammar and church musick without any expence to them.[60]\r\n\r\n  In the nunneries also young women were taught to work, and to read\r\n  English, and sometimes Latin also. So that not only the lower rank\r\n  of people, who could not pay for their learning, but most of the\r\n  noblemen and gentlemen’s daughters were educated in those\r\n  places.”[61]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: LYDGATE’S TRICKS AT SCHOOL.]\r\n\r\nAs Lydgate (born at Lydgate in Suffolk, six or seven miles from\r\nNewmarket) was ordained subdeacon in the Benedictine monastery of Bury\r\nSt Edmunds in 1389[62], he was probably sent as a boy to a monastic\r\nschool. At any rate, as he sketches his early escapades--apple-stealing,\r\nplaying truant, &c.,--for us in his _Testament_[63], I shall quote the\r\nyouth’s bit of the poem here:--\r\n\r\n  [Line numbers in the following selections were added by the\r\n  transcriber for use with sidenotes.]\r\n\r\n  Harleian MS. 2255, fol. 60.\r\n\r\n  Duryng the tyme / of this sesou{n} ver\r\n  I meene the sesou{n} / of my yeerys greene\r\n  Gynnyng fro childhood / strecchith{e}[A] vp so fer\r\n  to þe yeerys / accountyd ful Fifteene\r\n  bexperience / as it was weel seene\r\n  The gerissh{e} sesou{n} / straunge of condiciou{n}s\r\n  Dispoosyd to many vnbridlyd passiouns                                7\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: [fol. 60 b.]]\r\n\r\n  ¶ Voyd of resou{n} / yove to wilfulnesse\r\n  Froward to vertu / of thrift gaf[B] litil heede\r\n  loth to lerne / lovid no besynesse\r\n  Sauf pley or merthe / strau{n}ge to spelle or reede\r\n  Folwyng al appetites / longyng to childheede\r\n  lihtly tournyng wylde / and seelde sad\r\n  Weepyng for nouht / and anoon afftir glad                           14\r\n\r\n  ¶ For litil wroth / to stryve with my felawe\r\n  As my passiou{n}s / did my bridil leede\r\n  Of the yeerde somtyme / I Stood in awe\r\n  to be scooryd[C] / that was al my dreede\r\n  loth toward scole / lost my tyme in deede\r\n  lik a yong colt / that ran with-owte brydil\r\n  Made my freendys / ther good to spend in ydil /                     21\r\n\r\n    [Sidenotes (by line number):\r\n    [1] In my boyhood, [4] up to 15, [10] I loved no work but play\r\n    [17] yet I was afraid of being scored by the rod.]\r\n\r\n  ¶ I hadde in custom / to come to scole late\r\n  Nat for to lerne / but for a contenaunce\r\n  with my felawys / reedy to debate\r\n  to Iangle and Iape / was set al my plesaunce\r\n  wherof rebukyd / this was my chevisaunce\r\n  to forge a lesyng / and therupon to muse\r\n  whan I trespasyd / my silven to excuse                              28\r\n\r\n      [Sidenote: [fol. 61.]]\r\n\r\n  ¶ To my bettre / did no reverence\r\n  Of my sovereyns / gaf no fors at al\r\n  wex obstynat / by inobedience\r\n  Ran in to garydns / applys ther I stal\r\n  To gadre frutys / sparyd hegg[D] nor wal\r\n  to plukke grapys / in othir mennys vynes\r\n  Was moor reedy / than for to seyn[E] matynes                        35\r\n\r\n  ¶ My lust was al / to scorne folk and iape\r\n  Shrewde tornys / evir among to vse\r\n  to Skoffe and mowe[F] / lyk a wantou{n} Ape\r\n  whan I did evil / othre I did[G] accuse\r\n  My wittys five / in wast I did abuse[H]\r\n  Rediere chirstoonys / for to[I] telle\r\n  Than gon to chirche / or heere the sacry[K] belle                   42\r\n\r\n    [Sidenotes (by line number):\r\n    [22] I came to school late, [25] talked, [27] lied to get off\r\n    blame, [29] and mocked my masters.

They made me wonder\r\nless at the energy with which some people now are striving to erect\r\n“barriers against democracy” to prevent the return match for the old\r\ngame coming off.--However improving, and however justly retributive,\r\nfuture legislation for the rich by the poor in the spirit of past\r\nlegislation for the poor by the rich might be, it could hardly be\r\nconsidered pleasant, and is surely worth putting up the true barrier\r\nagainst, one of education in each poor man’s mind. (He who americanizes\r\nus thus far will be the greatest benefactor England has had for some\r\nages.)--These Statutes also made me think how the old spirit still\r\nlingers in England, how a friend of my own was curate in a Surrey\r\nvillage where the kind-hearted squire would allow none of the R’s but\r\nReading to be taught in his school; how another clergyman lately\r\nreported his Farmers’ meeting on the school question: Reading and\r\nWriting might be taught, but Arithmetic not; the boys would be getting\r\nto know too much about wages, and that would be troublesome; how,\r\nlastly, our gangs of children working on our Eastern-counties farms, and\r\nour bird-keeping boys of the whole South, can almost match the children\r\nof the agricultural labourer of 1388.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: NO BONDSMAN’S SON TO BE AN APPRENTICE.]\r\n\r\nThe early practice of the Freemasons, and other crafts, refusing to let\r\nany member take a bondsman’s son as an apprentice, was founded on the\r\nreasonable apprehension that his lord would or might afterwards claim\r\nthe lad, make him disclose the trade-secrets, and carry on his art for\r\nthe lord’s benefit.

On the post-Reformation\r\nSchools I refer readers to Mr Whiston’s _Cathedral Trusts_, 1850. He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n  “The Cathedrals of England are of two kinds, those of the old and\r\n  those of the new foundation: of the latter, Canterbury (the old\r\n  archiepiscopal see) and Carlisle, Durham, Ely, Norwich, Rochester,\r\n  and Worcester, old episcopal sees, were A.D. 1541-2 refounded, or\r\n  rather reformed, by Henry VIII. ... Besides these, he created five\r\n  other cathedral churches or colleges, in connexion with the five\r\n  new episcopal sees of Bristol, Chester, Gloucester, Oxford, and\r\n  Peterborough. He further created the see of Westminster, which was\r\n  ... subsequently (A.D. 1560) converted to a deanery collegiate by\r\n  Queen Elizabeth ... (p. 6). The preamble of the Act 31 Henry VIII.\r\n  c. 9, for founding the new cathedrals, preserved in Henry’s own\r\n  handwriting, recites that they were established ‘To the intente\r\n  that Gods worde myght the better be sett forthe, _cyldren broght\r\n  up in lernynge, clerces nuryshyd in the universities_, olde\r\n  servantes decayed, to have lyfing, allmes housys for pour folke to\r\n  be sustayned in, _Reders of grece, ebrew, and latyne to have good\r\n  stypende_, dayly almes to be mynistrate, mending of hyght wayes,\r\n  and exhybision for mynisters of the chyrche.’”\r\n\r\n“A general idea of the scope and nature of the cathedral establishments,\r\nas originally planned and settled by Henry VIII., may be formed from\r\nthe first chapter of the old statutes of Canterbury, which is almost\r\nidentical with the corresponding chapter of the statutes of all the\r\nother cathedrals of the new foundation. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n  “On[68] the entire number of those who have their sustentation\r\n  (qui sustentantur) in the cathedral and metropolitical church of\r\n  Canterbury:\r\n\r\n  “First of all we ordain and direct that there be for ever in our\r\n  aforesaid church, one dean, twelve canons, six preachers, twelve\r\n  minor canons, one deacon, one subdeacon, twelve lay-clerks, _one\r\n  master of the choristers, ten choristers, two teachers of the boys\r\n  in grammar, one of whom is to be the head master, the other,\r\n  second master, fifty boys to be instructed in grammar_,[69] twelve\r\n  poor men to be maintained at the costs and charges of the said\r\n  church, two vergers, two subsacrists (_i.e._, sextons), four\r\n  servants in the church to ring the bells, and arrange all the\r\n  rest, two porters, who shall also be barber-tonsors, one\r\n  caterer,[70] one butler, and one under butler, one cook, and one\r\n  under-cook, who, indeed, in the number prescribed, are to serve in\r\n  our church every one of them in his own order, according to our\r\n  statutes and ordinances.”\r\n\r\nIn the Durham statutes, as settled in the first year of Philip and Mary,\r\nthe corresponding chapter is as follows:\r\n\r\n  On[71] the total number of those who have their sustentation (qui\r\n  sustentantur) in the cathedral church of Durham.\r\n\r\n  “We direct and ordain that there be for ever in the said church,\r\n  one dean, twelve prebendaries, twelve minor canons, one deacon,\r\n  one sub-deacon, ten clerks, (who may be either clerks or laymen,)\r\n  _one master of the choristers, ten choristers, two teachers of the\r\n  boys in grammar, eighteen boys to be instructed in grammar_, eight\r\n  poor men to be maintained at the costs of the said church, two\r\n  subsacrists, two vergers, two porters, one of whom shall also be\r\n  barber-tonsor, one butler, one under-butler, one cook, and one\r\n  under-cook.”\r\n\r\n  “The monastic or collegiate character of the bodies thus\r\n  constituted, is indicated by the names and offices of the inferior\r\n  ministers above specified, who were intended to form a part of the\r\n  establishment of the Common Hall, in which most of the subordinate\r\n  members, including the boys to be instructed in grammar, were to\r\n  take their meals. There was also another point in which the\r\n  cathedrals were meant to resemble and supply the place of the old\r\n  religious houses, _i.e._, in the maintenance of a certain number\r\n  of students at the universities.”\r\n\r\n  R^t. WHISTON, _Cathedral Trusts and their Fulfilment_, p. 2-4.\r\n\r\n”The nature of these schools, and the desire to perpetuate and improve\r\nthem, may be inferred from ‘certein articles noted for the reformation\r\nof the cathedral churche of Excestr’, submitted by the commissioners of\r\nHenry VIII., unto the correction of the Kynges Majestie,’ as follows:\r\n\r\n  _The tenth Article_ submitted. “That ther may be in the said\r\n  Cathedral churche a free songe scole, the scolemaster to have\r\n  yerly of the said pastor and prechars xx. marks for his wages, and\r\n  his howss free, to teache xl. children frely, to rede, to write,\r\n  synge and playe upon instruments of musike, also to teache ther\r\n  A. B. C. in greke and hebrew.

At this erection were\r\n  present, Thomas Cranmer, archbishop, with divers other\r\n  commissioners. And nominating and electing such convenient and fit\r\n  persons as should serve for the furniture of the said Cathedral\r\n  church according to the new foundation, it came to pass that, when\r\n  they should elect the children of the Grammar school, there were\r\n  of the commissioners more than one or two who would have none\r\n  admitted but sons or younger brethren of gentlemen. As for other,\r\n  husbandmen’s children, they were more meet, they said, for the\r\n  plough, and to be artificers, than to occupy the place of the\r\n  learned sort; so that they wished none else to be put to school,\r\n  but only gentlemen’s children. Whereunto the most reverend father,\r\n  the Archbishop, being of a contrary mind, said, ‘That he thought\r\n  it not indifferent so to order the matter; for,’ said he, ‘poor\r\n  men’s children are many times endued with more singular gifts of\r\n  nature, which are also the gifts of God, as, with eloquence,\r\n  memory, apt pronunciation, sobriety, and such like; and also\r\n  commonly more apt to apply their study, than is the gentleman’s\r\n  son, delicately educated.’ Hereunto it was on the other part\r\n  replied, ‘that it was meet for the ploughman’s son to go to\r\n  plough, and the artificer’s son to apply the trade of his parent’s\r\n  vocation; and the gentleman’s children are meet to have the\r\n  knowledge of government and rule in the commonwealth. For we\r\n  have,’ said they, ‘as much need of ploughmen as any other state;\r\n  and all sorts of men may not go to school.’ ‘I grant,’ replied the\r\n  Archbishop, ‘much of your meaning herein as needful in a\r\n  commonwealth; but yet utterly to exclude the ploughman’s son and\r\n  the poor man’s son from the benefits of learning, as though they\r\n  were unworthy to have the gifts of the Holy Ghost bestowed upon\r\n  them as well as upon others, is as much to say, as that Almighty\r\n  God should not be at liberty to bestow his great gifts of grace\r\n  upon any person, nor nowhere else but as we and other men shall\r\n  appoint them to be employed, according to our fancy, and not\r\n  according to his most goodly will and pleasure, who giveth his\r\n  gifts both of learning, and other perfections in all sciences,\r\n  unto all kinds and states of people indifferently. Even so doth he\r\n  many times withdraw from them and their posterity again those\r\n  beneficial gifts, if they be not thankful. If we should shut up\r\n  into a strait corner the bountiful grace of the Holy Ghost, and\r\n  thereupon attempt to build our fancies, we should make as perfect\r\n  a work thereof as those that took upon them to build the Tower of\r\n  Babel; for God would so provide that the offspring of our\r\n  first-born children should peradventure become most unapt to\r\n  learn, and very dolts, as I myself have seen no small number of\r\n  them very dull and without all manner of capacity. And to say the\r\n  truth, I take it, that none of us all here, being gentlemen born\r\n  (as I think), but had our beginning that way from a low and base\r\n  parentage; and through the benefit of learning, and other civil\r\n  knowledge, for the most part all gentlemen ascend to their\r\n  estate.’ Then it was again answered, that the most part of the\r\n  nobility came up by feats of arms and martial acts. ‘As though,’\r\n  said the Archbishop, ‘that the noble captain was always\r\n  unfurnished of good learning and knowledge to persuade and\r\n  dissuade his army rhetorically; who rather that way is brought\r\n  unto authority than else his manly looks. To conclude; the poor\r\n  man’s son by pains-taking will for the most part be learned when\r\n  the gentleman’s son will not take the pains to get it. And we are\r\n  taught by the Scriptures that Almighty God raiseth up from the\r\n  dunghill, and setteth him in high authority. And whensoever it\r\n  pleaseth him, of his divine providence, he deposeth princes unto a\r\n  right humble and poor estate. Wherefore, if the gentleman’s son be\r\n  apt to learning, let him be admitted; if not apt, let the poor\r\n  man’s child that is apt enter his room.’ With words to the like\r\n  effect.”\r\n        R. WHISTON, _Cathedral Trusts_, p. 12-14.\r\n\r\nThe scandalous way in which the choristers and poor boys were done out\r\nof their proportion of the endowments by the Cathedral clergy, is to be\r\nseen in Mr Whiston’s little book.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: POOR MEN’S SONS HAVE HEADS AS WELL AS RICH ONES’.]\r\n\r\n6. _Endowed Grammar Schools._ These were mainly founded for citizens’\r\nand townsmen’s children.

Sch.\r\n\r\nAbout 1174 A.D., Fitzstephen speaks of the London schools and scholars\r\nthus:--I use Pegge’s translation, 1772, to which Mr Chappell\r\nreferred me,--\r\n\r\n  “The three principal churches in London[75] are privileged by\r\n  grant and ancient usage with schools, and they are all very\r\n  flourishing. Often indeed through the favour and countenance of\r\n  persons eminent in philosophy, more schools are permitted. On\r\n  festivals, at those churches where the Feast of the Patron Saint\r\n  is solemnized, the masters convene their scholars. The youth, on\r\n  that occasion, dispute, some in the demonstrative way, and some\r\n  logically. These produce their enthymemes, and those the more\r\n  perfect syllogisms. Some, the better to shew their parts, are\r\n  exercised in disputation, contending with one another, whilst\r\n  others are put upon establishing some truth by way of\r\n  illustration. Some sophists endeavour to apply, on feigned topics,\r\n  a vast heap and flow of words, others to impose upon you with\r\n  false conclusions. As to the orators, some with their rhetorical\r\n  harangues employ all the powers of persuasion, taking care to\r\n  observe the precepts of art, and to omit nothing opposite to the\r\n  subject. The boys of different schools wrangle with one another in\r\n  verse; contending about the principles of Grammar, or the rules of\r\n  the Perfect Tenses and Supines. Others there are, who in Epigrams,\r\n  or other compositions in numbers, use all that low ribaldry we\r\n  read of in the Ancients; attacking their school-masters, but\r\n  without mentioning names, with the old Fescennine licentiousness,\r\n  and discharging their scoffs and sarcasms against them; touching\r\n  the foibles of their school-fellows, or perhaps of greater\r\n  personages, with true Socratic wit, or biting them more keenly\r\n  with a Theonine tooth: The audience, fully disposed to laugh,\r\n\r\n    ‘With curling nose ingeminate the peals.’”\r\n\r\nOf the sports of the boys, Fitzstephen gives a long description. On\r\nShrove-Tuesday, each boy brought his fighting cock to his master, and\r\nthey had a cock-fight all morning in the school-room.[76] After dinner,\r\nfootball in the fields of the suburbs, probably Smithfield. Every Sunday\r\nin Lent they had a sham-fight, some on horseback, some on foot, the King\r\nand his Court often looking on. At Easter they played at the\r\nWater-Quintain, charging a target, which if they missed, souse they went\r\ninto the water. ‘On holidays in summer the pastime of the youths is to\r\nexercise themselves in archery, in running, leaping, wrestling, casting\r\nof stones, and flinging to certain distances, and lastly with bucklers.’\r\nAt moonrise the maidens danced. In the winter holidays, the boys saw\r\nboar-fights, hog-fights, bull and bear-baiting, and when ice came they\r\nslid, and skated on the leg-bones of some animal, punting themselves\r\nalong with an iron-shod pole, and charging one another. A set of merry\r\nscenes indeed.\r\n\r\n  “In general, we are assured by the most learned man of the\r\n  thirteenth century, Roger Bacon, that there never had been so\r\n  great an appearance of learning, and so general an application to\r\n  study, in so many different faculties, as in his time, when\r\n  schools were erected in every city, town, burgh, and castle.”\r\n  (Henry’s Hist. of England, vol. iv. p. 472-3.)\r\n\r\nIn the twenty-fifth year of Henry VI., 1447, four Grammar schools were\r\nappointed to be opened in London[77] for the education of the City youth\r\n(_Carlisle_). But from the above lists it will be seen that Grammar\r\nSchools had not much to do with the education of our nobility and gentry\r\nbefore 1450 A.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: AN ETON BOY IN A.D. 1478.]\r\n\r\nOf Eton studies, the Paston Letters notice only Latin versifying, but\r\nthey show us a young man supposed to be nineteen, still at school,\r\nhaving a smart pair of breeches for holy days, falling in love, eating\r\nfigs and raisins, proposing to come up to London for a day or two’s\r\nholiday or lark to his elder brother’s, and having 8d. sent him in a\r\nletter to buy a pair of slippers with. William Paston, a younger brother\r\nof John’s, when about nineteen years old, and studying at Eton, writes\r\non Nov. 7, 1478, to thank his brother for a noble in gold, and says,\r\n\r\n  “my creanser (creditor) Master Thomas (Stevenson) heartily\r\n  recommendeth him to you, and he prayeth you to send him some money\r\n  for my commons, for he saith ye be twenty shillings in his debt,\r\n  for a month was to pay for when he had money last; also I beseech\r\n  you to send me a hose cloth, one for the holy days of some colour,\r\n  and another for working days (how coarse soever it be, it maketh\r\n  no matter), and a stomacher and two shirts, and a pair of\r\n  slippers: and if it like you that I may come with Alweder by\r\n  water”--would they take a pair-oar and pull down? (the figs and\r\n  raisins came up by a barge;)--“and sport me with you at London a\r\n  day or two this term-time, then ye may let all this be till the\r\n  time that I come, and then I will tell you when I shall be ready\r\n  to come from Eton by the grace of God, who have you in his\r\n  keeping.” _Paston Letters_, modernised, vol. 2, p. 129.\r\n\r\nThis is the first letter; the second one about the figs, raisins, and\r\nlove-making (dated 23 Feb. 1478-9) is given at vol. ii. p. 122-3.\r\n\r\nTusser, who was seized as a Singing boy for the King’s Chapel, lets us\r\nknow that he got well birched at Eton.\r\n\r\n  “From Paul’s I went · to Eton sent\r\n  To learn straightways · the Latin phrase\r\n  When fifty-three · stripes given to me\r\n        At once I had:\r\n\r\n  For fault but small · or none at all\r\n  It come to pass · thus beat I was.\r\n  See, Udall,[78] see · the mercy of thee\r\n        To me poor lad!”\r\n\r\nI was rather surprised to find no mention of any Eton men in the first\r\nvol. of Wood’s _Athenæ Oxonienses_ (ed. Bliss) except two, who had first\r\ntaken degrees at Cambridge, Robert Aldrich and William Alley, the latter\r\nadmitted at Cambridge 1528 (Wood, p. 375, col. 2). Plenty of London men\r\nare named in Wood, vol. 1. No doubt in early times the Eton men went to\r\ntheir own foundation, King’s (or other Colleges at) Cambridge, while the\r\nWinchester men went to their foundation, New College, or elsewhere at\r\nOxford. In the first volume of Bliss’s edition of Wood, the following\r\nWinchester men are noticed:\r\n\r\n  p. 30, col. 2, William Grocyn, educated in grammaticals in Wykeham’s\r\n    school near Winchester.\r\n\r\n  p. 78, col. 2, William Horman, made fellow of New Coll. in 1477.\r\n    Author of the _Vulgaria Puerorum_, &c.

Strype says,\r\n\r\n  “On the 15th of January, 1562, Thomas Williams, of the Inner\r\n  Temple, esq. being chosen speaker to the lower house, was\r\n  presented to the queen: and in his speech to her ... took notice\r\n  of the want of schools; that at least an hundred were wanting in\r\n  England which before this time had been, [being destroyed\r\n  (I suppose he meant) by the dissolution of monasteries and\r\n  religious houses, fraternities and colleges.] He would have had\r\n  England continually flourishing with ten thousand scholars, which\r\n  the schools in this nation formerly brought up. That from the want\r\n  of these good schoolmasters sprang up ignorance: and covetousness\r\n  got the livings by impropriations; which was a decay, he said, of\r\n  learning, and by it the tree of knowledge grew downward, not\r\n  upward; which grew greatly to the dishonour, both of God and the\r\n  commonwealth. He mentioned likewise the decay of the universities;\r\n  and how that great market-towns were without schools or preachers:\r\n  and that the poor vicar had but 20_l._ [or some such poor\r\n  allowance,] and the rest, being no small sum, was impropriated.\r\n  And so thereby, no preacher there; but the people, being trained\r\n  up and led in blindness for want of instruction, became obstinate:\r\n  and therefore advised that this should be seen to, and\r\n  impropriations redressed, notwithstanding the laws already made\r\n  [which favoured them].--Strype, _Annals of the Reformation_, vol.\r\n  i. p. 437.\r\n\r\nOf the Grammar Schools in his time (A.D. 1577) Harrison says:\r\n\r\n  Besides these universities, also there are a great number of\r\n  Grammer Schooles throughout the realme, and those verie liberallie\r\n  endued for the better relief of pore scholers, so that there are\r\n  not manie corporate townes, now under the queene’s dominion that\r\n  have not one Gramer Schole at the least, with a sufficient living\r\n  for a master and usher appointed to the same.\r\n\r\n  There are in like manner divers collegiat churches, as Windsor,\r\n  Wincester, Eaton, Westminster (in which I was sometime an\r\n  unprofitable Grammarian under the reverend father, master Nowell,\r\n  now dean of Paules) and in those a great number of pore scholers,\r\n  dailie maintained by the liberality of the founders, with meat,\r\n  bookes, and apparell; from whence after they have been well\r\n  entered in the knowledge of the Latine and Greek tongs, and rules\r\n  of versifying (the triall whereof is made by certain apposers,\r\n  yearlie appointed to examine them), they are sent to certain\r\n  especiall houses in each universitie[79], where they are received\r\n  & trained up in the points of higher knowledge in their privat\r\n  halls till they be adjudged meet to show their faces in the\r\n  schooles, as I have said alreadie.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: STUDY OF ENGLISH RECOMMENDED IN 1582-1612.]\r\n\r\nGreek was first taught at a public school in England by Lillye soon\r\nafter the year 1500. This was at St Paul’s School in London, then newly\r\nestablished by Dean Colet, and to which Erasmus alluded as the best of\r\nits time in 1514, when he said that he had in three years taught a youth\r\nmore Latin than he could have acquired in any school in England, _ne\r\nLiliana quidem excepta_, not even Lillye’s excepted. (Warton, iii. 1.)\r\nThe first schoolmaster who stood up for the study of English was,\r\nI believe, Richard Mulcaster, of King’s College, Cambridge, and Christ\r\nChurch, Oxford. In 1561 he was appointed the first head-master of\r\nMerchant-Taylors School in London, then just founded as a feeder or\r\npro-seminary for St John’s College, Oxford (_Warton_, iii. 282). In his\r\nElementarie, 1582, he has a long passage on the study of English, the\r\nwhole of which I print here, at Mr Quick’s desire, as it has slipt out\r\nof people’s minds, and Mulcaster deserves honour for it:--\r\n\r\n  “But bycause I take vpon me in this Elementarie, besides som\r\n  frindship to secretaries for the pen, and to correctors for the\r\n  print, to direct such peple as teach childern to read and write\r\n  English, and the _reading_ must nedes be such as the writing leads\r\n  vnto, thererfor, (_sic_) befor I medle with anie particular\r\n  precept, to direct the Reader, I will thoroughlie rip vp the hole\r\n  certaintie of our English writing, so far furth and with such\r\n  assurance, as probabilitie can make me, bycause it is a thing both\r\n  proper to my argument, and profitable to my cuntrie. For our\r\n  naturall tung being as beneficiall vnto vs for our nedefull\r\n  deliuerie, as anie other is to the peple which vse it: & hauing as\r\n  pretie, and as fair obseruations in it, as anie other hath: and\r\n  being as readie to yield to anie rule of Art, as anie other is:\r\n  why should I not take som pains to find out the right writing of\r\n  ours, as other cuntrimen haue don to find the like in theirs? & so\r\n  much the rather, bycause it is pretended, that the writing thereof\r\n  is meruellous vncertain, and scant to be recouered from extreme\r\n  confusion, without som change of as great extremitie? I mean\r\n  therefor so to deall in it, as I maie wipe awaie that opinio{n} of\r\n  either vncertaintie for co{n}fusion, or impossibilitie for\r\n  directio{n}, that both the naturall English maie haue wherein to\r\n  rest, & the desirous st[r]anger maie haue whereby to learn. For\r\n  the performa{n}ce whereof, and mine own better direction, I will\r\n  first examin those means, whereby other tungs of most sacred\r\n  antiquitie haue bene brought to Art and form of discipline for\r\n  their right writing, to the end that by following their waie,\r\n  I maie hit vpo{n} their right, and at the least by their president\r\n  deuise the like to theirs, where the vse of our tung, & the\r\n  propertie of our dialect will not yeild flat to theirs. That don,\r\n  I will set all the varietie of our now writing, & the vncertaine\r\n  force of all our letters, in as much certaintie, as anie writing\r\n  ca{n} be, by these sene{n} precepts,-- 1. _Generall rule_, which\r\n  concerneth the propertie and vse of ech letter: 2. _Proportion_\r\n  which reduceth all words of one sou{n}d to the same writing:\r\n  3. _Composition_, which teacheth how to write one word made of mo:\r\n  4. _Deriuation_, which examineth the ofspring of euerie originall:\r\n  5. _Distinction_ which bewraieth the difference of sound and force\r\n  in letters by som writen figure or accent: 6. _Enfranchisment_,\r\n  which directeth the right writing of all incorporat foren words:\r\n  7. _Prerogatiue_, which declareth a reseruation, wherein common\r\n  vse will continew hir precèdence in our En[g]lish writing, as she\r\n  hath don euerie where else, both for the form of the letter, in\r\n  som places, which likes the pen better: and for the difference in\r\n  writing, where som particular caueat will chek a common rule. In\r\n  all these seuen I will so examin the particularities of our tung,\r\n  as either nothing shall seme strange at all, or if anie thing do\r\n  seme, yet it shall not seme so strange, but that either the self\r\n  same, or the verie like vnto it, or the more strange then it is,\r\n  shal appear to be in, those things, which ar more familiar vnto vs\r\n  for extraordinarie learning, then required of vs for our ordinarie\r\n  vse. And forasmuch as the eie will help manie to write right by a\r\n  sene president, which either cannot vnderstand, or cannot entend\r\n  to vnderstand the reason of a rule, therefor in the end of this\r\n  treatis for right writing, I purpos to set down a generall table\r\n  of most English words, by waie of president, to help such plane\r\n  peple, as cannot entend the vnderstanding of a rule, which\r\n  requireth both time and conceit in perceiuing, but can easilie run\r\n  to a generall table, which is readier to their hand. By the which\r\n  table I shall also confirm the right of my rules, that theie hold\r\n  thoroughout, & by multitude of exa{m}ples help som maim (_so_) in\r\n  precepts. Thus much for the right writing of our English tung,\r\n  which maie seme (_so_) for a preface to the principle of\r\n  _Reading_, as the matter of the one is the maker of the\r\n  other.--1582. Rich^d. Mulcaster. The First Part of the\r\n  Elementarie, pp. 53-4.\r\n\r\nBrinsley follows Mulcaster in exhorting to the study of English:\r\n\r\n  “there seemes vnto mee, to bee a verie maine want in all our\r\n  Grammar schooles generally, or in the most of them; whereof I haue\r\n  heard som great learned men to complain; That there is no care had\r\n  in respect, to traine vp schollars so as they may be able to\r\n  expresse their minds purely and readily in our owne tongue, and to\r\n  increase in the practice of it, as well as in the Latine or\r\n  Greeke; whereas our chiefe indeuour should bee for it, and that\r\n  for these reasons. 1. Because that language which all sorts and\r\n  conditions of men amongst vs are to haue most vse of, both in\r\n  speech & writing, is our owne natiue tongue. 2. The purity and\r\n  elegancie of our owne language is to be esteemed a chiefe part of\r\n  the honour of our nation: which we all ought to aduance as much as\r\n  in vs lieth. As when Greece and Rome and other nations haue most\r\n  florished, their languages also haue beene most pure: and from\r\n  those times of Greece & Rome, wee fetch our chiefest patterns, for\r\n  the learning of their tongues. 3. Because of those which are for a\r\n  time trained vp in schooles, there are very fewe which proceede in\r\n  learning, in comparison of them that follow other callings.\r\n\r\n    John Brinsley, _The Grammar Schoole_, p. 21, 22.\r\n\r\n  His “Meanes to obtaine this benefit of increasing in our English tong,\r\n  as in the Latin,” are\r\n\r\n  1. Daily vse of Lillies rules construed.\r\n  2. Continuall practice of English Grammaticall translations.\r\n  3. Translating and writing English, with some other Schoole exercises.\r\n\r\n      _Ibid._, side-notes, p. 22, 23.\r\n\r\nOn this question of English boys studying English, let it be remembered\r\nthat in this year of grace 1867, in all England there is just one public\r\nschool at which English is studied historically--the City of London\r\nSchool--and that in this school it was begun only last year by the new\r\nHead-Master, the Rev. Edwin A. Abbot, all honour to him. In every class\r\nan English textbook is read, _Piers Plowman_ being that for the highest\r\nclass. This neglect of English as a subject of study is due no doubt to\r\ntutors’ and parents’ ignorance. None of them know the language\r\nhistorically; the former can’t teach it, the latter don’t care about it;\r\nwhy should their boys learn it? Oh tutors and parents, there are such\r\nthings as asses in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: A GRAMMAR-SCHOOL BOY’S DAY IN A.D. 1612.]\r\n\r\nOf the school-life of a Grammar-school boy in 1612 we may get a notion\r\nfrom Brinsley’s p. 296, “chap. xxx. Of Schoole times, intermissions and\r\nrecreations,” which is full of interest. ‘1. The Schoole-time should\r\nbeginne at sixe: all who write Latine to make their exercises which were\r\ngiuen ouernight, in that houre before seuen’.--To make boys punctual,\r\n‘so many of them as are there at sixe, to haue their places as they had\r\nthem by election[80] or the day before: all who come after six, euery\r\none to sit as he commeth, and so to continue that day, and vntill he\r\nrecouer his place againe by the election of the fourme or otherwise....\r\nIf any cannot be brought by this, them to be noted in the blacke Bill by\r\na speciall marke, and feele the punishment thereof: and sometimes\r\npresent correction to be vsed for terrour.... Thus they are to continue\r\nvntill nine [at work in class], signified by Monitours, Subdoctour or\r\notherwise. Then at nine ... to let them to haue a quarter of an houre at\r\nleast, or more, for intermission, eyther for breakefast ... or else for\r\nthe necessitie of euery one, or their honest recreation, or to prepare\r\ntheir exercises against the Masters comming in. [2.] After, each of them\r\nto be in his place in an instant, vpon the knocking of the dore or some\r\nother sign ... so to continue vntill eleuen of the clocke, or somwhat\r\nafter, to counteruaile the time of the intermission at nine.\r\n\r\n(3.) To be againe all ready, and in their places at one, in an instant;\r\nto continue vntill three, or halfe an houre after: then to haue another\r\nquarter of an houre or more, as at nine for drinking and necessities; so\r\nto continue till halfe an houre after fiue: thereby in that halfe houre\r\nto counteruaile the time at three; then to end so as was shewed, with\r\nreading a peece of a Chapter, and with singing two staues of a Psalme:\r\nlastly with prayer to be vsed by the Master.’\r\n\r\nTo the objectors to these intermissions at nine and three, who may\r\nreproach the schoole, thinking that they do nothing but play, Brinsley\r\nanswers,-- ‘2. By this meanes also the Schollars may bee kept euer in\r\ntheir places, and hard to their labours, without that running out to the\r\nCampo (as the[y] tearme it) at school times, and the manifolde disorders\r\nthereof; as watching and striuing for the clubbe,[81] and loytering then\r\nin the fields; some hindred that they cannot go forth at all. (5.) it is\r\nvery requisite also, that they should have weekly one part of an\r\nafternoone for recreation, as a reward of their diligence, obedience and\r\nprofiting; and that to be appointed at the Masters discretion, eyther\r\nthe Thursday, after the vsuall custom; or according to the best\r\nopportunity of the place.... All recreations and sports of schollars,\r\nwould be meet for Gentlemen. Clownish sports, or perilous, or yet\r\nplaying for money, are no way to be admitted.’\r\n\r\nOn the age at which boys went to school, Brinsley says, p. 9,\r\n\r\n  “For the time of their entrance with vs, in our countrey schooles,\r\n  it is commonly about 7. or 8. yeares olde: six is very soone. If\r\n  any begin so early, they are rather sent to the schoole to keepe\r\n  them from troubling the house at home, and from danger, and shrewd\r\n  turnes, then for any great hope and desire their friends haue that\r\n  they should learne anything in effect.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: THE GOOD OLD TIMES OF SMOKE AND FILTH.]\r\n\r\nTo return from this digression on Education. Enough has been said to\r\nshow that the progress of Education, in our sense of the word, was\r\nrather from below upwards, than from above downwards; and I conclude\r\nthat the young people to whom the _Babees Boke_, &c., were addressed,\r\nwere the children of our nobility, knights, and squires, and that the\r\nstate of their manners, as left by their home training, was such as to\r\nneed the inculcation on them of the precepts contained in the Poems. If\r\nso, dirty, ill-mannered, awkward young gawks, must most of these\r\nhopes-of-England have been, to modern notions. The directions for\r\npersonal cleanliness must have been much needed when one considers the\r\nsmall stock of linen and clothes that men not rich must have had; and if\r\nwe may judge from a passage in Edward the Fourth’s _Liber Niger_, even\r\nthe King himself did not use his footpan every Saturday night, and would\r\nnot have been the worse for an occasional tubbing:--\r\n\r\n  “This barbour shall have, every satyrday at nyght, _if_ it please\r\n  the Kinge to cleanse his head, legges, or feet, and for his\r\n  shaving, two loves, one picher wyne. And the ussher of chambre\r\n  ought to testyfye if this is necessaryly dispended or not.”\r\n\r\nSo far as appears from Edward the Fourth’s _Liber Niger Domus_, soap was\r\nused only for washing clothes. The yeoman lavender, or washerman, was to\r\ntake from the Great Spicery ‘as muche whyte soape, greye, and blacke, as\r\ncan be thought resonable by proufe of the Countrollers,’ and therewith\r\n‘tenderly to waysshe ... the stuffe for the Kinges propyr persone’ (_H.\r\nOrd._ p. 85); but whether that cleansing material ever touched His\r\nMajesty’s sacred person (except doubtless when and if the barber shaved\r\nhim), does not appear. The Ordinances are considerate as to sex, and\r\nprovide for “weomen lavendryes” for a Queen, and further that “these\r\nofficers oughte to bee sworne to keepe the chambre counsaylle.” But it\r\nis not for one of a nation that has not yet taken generally to tubbing\r\nand baths, or left off shaving, to reproach his forefathers with want of\r\ncleanliness, or adherence to customs that involve contradiction of the\r\nteachings of physiologists, and the evident intent of Nature or the\r\nCreator. Moreover, reflections on the good deeds done, and the high\r\nthoughts thought, by men of old dirtier than some now, may prevent us\r\nconcluding that because other people now talk through their noses, and\r\nhave manners different from our own, they and their institutions must be\r\nwholly abominable; that because others smell when heated, they ought to\r\nbe slaves; or that eating peas with a knife renders men unworthy of the\r\nfranchise. The temptation to value manners above morals, and\r\npleasantness above honesty, is one that all of us have to guard against.\r\nAnd when we have held to a custom merely because it is old, have refused\r\nto consider fairly the reasons for its change, and are inclined to\r\ngrumble when the change is carried out, we shall be none the worse for\r\nthinking of the people, young and old, who, in the time of Harrison and\r\nShakspere, the “Forgotten Worthies”[82] and Raleigh, no doubt ‘hated\r\nthose nasty new oak houses and chimnies,’ and sighed for the good old\r\ntimes:\r\n\r\n  “And yet see the change, for when our houses were builded of\r\n  willow, then had we oken men; but now that our houses are come to\r\n  be made of oke, our men are not onlie become willow, but a great\r\n  manie through Persian delicacie crept in among vs, altogither of\r\n  straw, which is a sore alteration.... Now haue we manie chimnies,\r\n  and yet our tenderlings complaine of rheumes, catarhs and poses.\r\n  Then had we none but reredosses, and our heads did neuer ake.[83]\r\n  For as the smoke in those daies was supposed to be a sufficient\r\n  hardning for the timber of the house; so it was reputed a far\r\n  better medicine to keepe the goodman and his familie from the\r\n  quack or pose, wherewith as then verie few were oft acquainted.”\r\n  _Harrison_, i. 212, col. 1, quoted by Ellis.\r\n\r\nIf rich men and masters were dirty, poor men and servants must have been\r\ndirtier still. William Langlande’s description of Hawkyn’s one\r\nmetaphorical dress in which he slept o’ nightes as well as worked by\r\nday, beslobbered (or by-_moled_, bemauled) by children, was true of the\r\nreal smock; flesh-moths must have been plentiful, and the sketch of\r\nCoveitise, as regards many men, hardly an exaggeration:\r\n\r\n  ... as a bonde-man of his bacon · his berd was bi-draveled,\r\n  With his hood on his heed · a lousy hat above,\r\n  And in a tawny tabard · of twelf wynter age\r\n  Al so torn and baudy · and ful of lys crepyng,\r\n  But if that a lous[84] couthe · han lopen the bettre,\r\n  She sholde noght han walked on that welthe · so was it thred-bare.\r\n      (_Vision_, Passus V. vol. 1, l. 2859-70, ed. Wright.)\r\n\r\nIn the _Kinge and Miller_, Percy Folio MS., p. 236 (in vol. ii. of the\r\nprint), when the Miller proposes that the stranger should sleep with\r\ntheir son, Richard the son says to the King,\r\n\r\n  “Nay, first,” q{uo}th Richard, “good fellowe, tell me true,\r\n    hast thou noe creep{er}s in thy gay hose?\r\n  art thou not troabled w{i}th the Scabbado?”\r\n\r\nThe colour of washerwomen’s legs was due partly to dirt, I suppose. The\r\nprincess or queen Clarionas, when escaping with the laundress as her\r\nassistant, is obliged to have her white legs reduced to the customary\r\nshade of grey:\r\n\r\n  Right as she should stoupe a-douñ,\r\n  The quene was tukked wel on high;\r\n  The lauender p{er}ceiued wel therbigh\r\n  Hir white legges, and seid “ma dame,\r\n  Youre shin boones might doo vs blame;\r\n  Abide,” she seid, “so mot I thee,\r\n  More slotered thei most be.”\r\n  Asshes with the water she menged,\r\n  And her white legges al be-sprenged.\r\n      ab. 1440 A.D., _Syr Generides_, p. 218, ll. 7060-8.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Headnote: NAKED SCULLIONS AND DIRTY STREETS.]\r\n\r\nIf in Henry the Eighth’s kitchen, scullions lay about naked, or tattered\r\nand filthy, what would they do elsewhere? Here is the King’s Ordinance\r\nagainst them in 1526:\r\n\r\n  “And for the better avoydyng of corruption and all uncleannesse\r\n  out of the Kings house, which doth ingender danger of infection,\r\n  and is very noisome and displeasant unto all the noblemen and\r\n  others repaireing unto the same; it is ordeyned by the Kings\r\n  Highnesse, that the three master cookes of the kitchen shall have\r\n  everie of them by way of reward yearly twenty marks, to the intent\r\n  they shall prouide and sufficiently furnish the said kitchens of\r\n  such scolyons as shall not goe _naked or in garments of such\r\n  vilenesse as they now doe, and have been acustomed to doe, nor lie\r\n  in the nights and dayes in the kitchens or ground by the\r\n  fireside;_ but that they of the said money may be found with\r\n  honest and whole course garments, without such uncleannesse as may\r\n  be the annoyance of those by whom they shall passe”...\r\n\r\nThat our commonalty, at least, in Henry VIII.’s time did stink (as is\r\nthe nature of man to do) may be concluded from Wolsey’s custom, when\r\ngoing to Westminster Hall, of\r\n\r\n  “holding in his hand a very fair orange, whereof the meat or\r\n  substance within was taken out, and filled up again with the part\r\n  of a sponge, wherein was vinegar, and other confections against\r\n  the pestilent airs; the which he most commonly smelt unto, passing\r\n  among the press, or else when he was pestered with many suitors.”\r\n  (_Cavendish_, p. 43.)\r\n\r\nOn the dirt in English houses and streets we may take the testimony of\r\na witness who liked England, and lived in it, and who was not likely to\r\nmisrepresent its condition,--Erasmus. In a letter to Francis, the\r\nphysician of Cardinal Wolsey, says Jortin,\r\n\r\n  “Erasmus ascribes the plague (from which England was hardly ever\r\n  free) and the sweating-sickness, partly to the incommodious form\r\n  and bad exposition of the houses, to the filthiness of the\r\n  streets, and to the sluttishness within doors. The floors, says\r\n  he, are commonly of clay, strewed with rushes, under which lies\r\n  unmolested an ancient collection of beer, grease (?), fragments,\r\n  bones, spittle, excrements [t.i. urine] of dogs and cats [t.i.\r\n  men,] and every thing that is nasty, &c.” (_Life of Erasmus_, i.\r\n  69, ed. 1808, referred to in Ellis, i. 328, note.)\r\n\r\nThe great scholar’s own words are,\r\n\r\n  Tum sola fere sunt argilla, tum scirpis palustribus, qui subinde\r\n  sic renovantur, ut fundamentum maneat aliquoties annos viginti,\r\n  sub se fovens sputa, vomitus, mictum canum et hominum, projectam\r\n  cervisiam, et piscium reliquias, aliasque sordes non nominandas.\r\n  Hinc mutato cœlo vapor quidam exhalatur, mea sententia minime\r\n  salubris humano corpori.\r\n\r\nAfter speaking also _De salsamentis_ (rendered ‘_salt meat_, beef,\r\npork, &c.,’ by Jortin, but which _Liber Cure Cocorum_ authorises us in\r\ntranslating ‘Sauces’[85]), _quibus vulgus mirum in modum delectatur_, he\r\nsays the English would be more healthy if their windows were made so as\r\nto shut out noxious winds, and then continues,\r\n\r\n  “Conferret huc, si vulgo parcior victus persuaderi posset, ac\r\n  salsamentorum moderatior usus.

Francisco.\r\n  Cardinalis Eboracencis Medico, S.\r\n\r\nIf it be objected that I have in the foregoing extracts shown the dark\r\nside of the picture, and not the bright one, my answer is that the\r\nbright one--of the riches and luxury in England--must be familiar to\r\nall our members, students (as I assume) of our early books, that the\r\nTreatises in this Volume sufficiently show this bright side, and that to\r\nme, as foolometer of the Society, this dark side seemed to need showing.\r\nBut as _The Chronicle_ of May 11, 1867, in its review of Mr Fox Bourne’s\r\n_English Merchants_, seems to think otherwise, I quote its words,\r\np. 155, col. 2.\r\n\r\n  “All the nations of the world, says Matthew of Westminster, were\r\n  kept warm by the wool of England, made into cloth by the men of\r\n  Flanders. And while we gave useful clothing to other countries, we\r\n  received festive garments from them in return. For most of our\r\n  information on these subjects we are indebted to Matthew Paris,\r\n  who tells us that when Alexander III. of Scotland was married to\r\n  Margaret, daughter of Henry III., one thousand English knights\r\n  appeared at the wedding in _cointises_ of silk, and the next day\r\n  each knight donned a new robe of another kind. This grand\r\n  entertainment was fatal to sixty oxen, and cost the then\r\n  Archbishop of York no less a sum than 4000 marks. Macpherson\r\n  remarks on this great display of silk as a proof of the wealth of\r\n  England under the Norman kings, a point which has not been\r\n  sufficiently elaborated. In 1242 the streets of London were\r\n  covered or shaded with silk, for the reception of Richard, the\r\n  King’s brother, on his return from the Holy Land. Few Englishmen\r\n  are aware of the existence of such magnificence at that early\r\n  period; while every story-book of history gives us the reverse of\r\n  the picture, telling us of straw-covered floors, scarcity of body\r\n  linen, and the like. Long after this, in 1367, it is recorded, as\r\n  a special instance of splendour of costume, that 1000 citizens of\r\n  Genoa were clothed in silk; and this tale has been repeated from\r\n  age to age, while the similar display, at an earlier date, in\r\n  England, has passed unnoticed.”\r\n\r\nFor a notice of the several pieces in the present volume, I refer the\r\nreader to the Preface to Russell’s _Boke of Nurture_, which follows\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nIt only remains for me to say that the freshness of my first interest\r\nin the poems which I once hoped to re-produce in these Forewords, has\r\nbecome dulled by circumstances and the length of time that the volume\r\nhas been in the press--it having been set aside (by my desire) for the\r\n_Ayenbite_, &c.;--and that the intervention of other work has prevented\r\nmy making the collection as complete as I had desired it to be. It is,\r\nhowever, the fullest verse one that has yet appeared on its subject,\r\nand will serve as the beginning of the Society’s store of this kind of\r\nmaterial.[86] If we can do all the English part of the work, and the\r\nMaster of the Rolls will commission one of his Editors to do the Latin\r\npart, we shall then get a fairly complete picture of that Early English\r\nHome which, with all its shortcomings, should be dear to every\r\nEnglishman now.\r\n\r\n  3, _St George’s Square, N.W._,\r\n\r\n    5th _June_, 1867.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: The first sentence of Aristotle’s _Metaphysics_ is\r\n    ‘All men by nature are actuated by the desire of knowledge.’ Mr\r\n    Skeat’s note on l. 78 of _Partenay_, p. 228.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Lawrens Andrewe. _The noble lyfe & natures of man, of\r\n    bestes_, &c.

Without entering\r\n    into the controversy, it may be sufficient to state, that in the\r\n    reign of Henry the Eighth it meant the pages of honour. They were\r\n    the sons of gentlemen, and in public processions always walked\r\n    near the monarch’s horse: a correct idea may be formed of their\r\n    appearance from the representation of them in one of the pictures\r\n    in the meeting room of the Society of Antiquarians. It seems from\r\n    these entries (p. 79,[*] 125, 182, 209, 230, 265) that they lodged\r\n    in the house of Johnson, the master of the king’s barge, and that\r\n    the rent of it was 40_s_. per annum. Observations on the word will\r\n    be found in Spelman’s _Etymol._, Pegge’s _Curialia_, from the\r\n    Liber Niger, Edw.

He is a most provokingly\r\n    careful editor.

My own introduction to it was due to a\r\nchance turning over, for another purpose, of the leaves of the MS.\r\ncontaining it. Mr Wheatley then told me of Ritson’s reference to it in\r\nhis _Bibliographica Poetica_, p. 96; and when the text was all printed,\r\na reference in _The Glossary of Domestic Architecture_ (v. III. Pt. I.\r\np. 76, note, col. 2) sent me to MS. Sloane 1315[1]--in the Glossary\r\nstated to have been written in 1452--which proved to be a different and\r\nunnamed version of Russell. Then the Sloane Catalogue disclosed a third\r\nMS., No. 2027[2], and the earliest of the three, differing rather less\r\nthan No. 1315 from Russell’s text, but still anonymous. I have therefore\r\nto thank for knowledge of the MSS. that special Providence which watches\r\nover editors as well as children and drunkards, and have not on this\r\noccasion to express gratitude to Ritson and Warton, to whom every lover\r\nof Early English Manuscripts is under such deep obligations, and whose\r\nguiding hands (however faltering) in Poetry have made us long so often\r\nfor the like in Prose. Would that one of our many Historians of English\r\nLiterature had but conceived the idea of cataloguing the materials for\r\nhis History before sitting down to write it! Would that a wise\r\nGovernment would commission another Hardy to do for English Literature\r\nwhat the Deputy-Keeper of the Public Records is now doing for English\r\nHistory-- give us a list of the MSS. and early printed books of it! What\r\ntime and trouble such a Catalogue would save!\r\n\r\nBut to return to John Russell and his Boke. He describes himself at the\r\nbeginning and end of his treatise as Usher and Marshal to Humphrey, Duke\r\nof Gloucester, delighting in his work in youth, quitting it only when\r\ncompelled by crooked age, and then anxious to train up worthy successors\r\nin the art and mystery of managing a well-appointed household. A man\r\nevidently who knew his work in every detail, and did it all with pride;\r\nnot boastful, though upholding his office against rebellious cooks[3],\r\nputting them down with imperial dignity, “we may allow and disallow; our\r\noffice is the chief!” A simple-minded religious man too,--as the close\r\nof his Treatise shows,--and one able to appreciate the master he served,\r\nthe “prynce fulle royalle,” the learned and munificent Humphrey Duke of\r\nGloucester, the patron of Lydgate, Occleve, Capgrave, Withamstede,\r\nLeonard Aretine, Petrus Candidus, Petrus de Monte, Tito Livio, Antoyne\r\nde Beccara, &c. &c., the lover of Manuscripts, the first great donor to\r\nthe Oxford University Library which Bodley revived[4], “that prince\r\npeerless,” as Russell calls him, a man who, with all his faults, loved\r\nbooks and authors, and shall be respected by us as he was by Lydgate.\r\nBut our business is with the Marshal, not the Master, and we will hear\r\nwhat John Russell says of himself in his own verse,\r\n\r\n  an vssher{e} y Am / ye may behold{e} /\r\n        to a prynce of high{e} degre,\r\n  þat enioyeth{e} to enforme & teche /\r\n        all{e} þo thatt wille thrive

moche youth{e} in co{n}nyng{e} / is bareñ & full{e} vnable.\r\n\r\n    (l. 3-9.)\r\n\r\nAt the end of his Boke he gives us a few more details about himself and\r\nhis work in life:\r\n\r\n  Now good soñ, y haue shewed the / & brought þe in vre,\r\n  to know þe Curtesie of court / & these þow may take in cur{e},\r\n  In pantry / botery / or celler{e} /\r\n        & in kervyng{e} a-for{e} a

on, at line 1211, he says,\r\n\r\n  “Moor{e} of þis co{n}nyng{e} y Cast not me to contreve:\r\n  my tyme is not to tary, hit drawest fast to eve.\r\n  þis tretyse þat y haue entitled, if it ye entende

 but croked age hath{e} co{m}pelled me / & leue court y must nede.\r\n  þerfor{e}, son{e}, assay thy self / & god shall{e} be þy spede.”\r\n\r\nAnd again, at line 1227,\r\n\r\n  “Now, good soñ, thy self, w{i}t{h} other þ{a}t shall{e} þe succede,\r\n  which{e} þus boke of nurtur{e} shall{e} note / lerne, & ou{er} rede,\r\n  pray for the sowle of Iohñ Russell{e}, þat god do hym mede,\r\n  Som tyme

probably to cut it out.]\r\n\r\nAs to his Boke, besides what is quoted above, John Russell says,\r\n\r\n  Go forth{e} lytell{e} boke, and lowly þow me co{m}mende\r\n  vnto all{e} yong{e} gentilmeñ /

of the Epilogue quoted above, lines\r\n1235-50, then it would seem that in this Treatise he only corrected and\r\ntouched up some earlier Book of Norture which he had used in his youth,\r\nand which, if Sloane 2027 be not its original, may be still extant in\r\nits primal state in Mr Arthur Davenport’s MS., “How to serve a Lord,”\r\n_said_ to be of the fourteenth century[6], and now supposed to be stowed\r\naway in a hayloft with the owner’s other books, awaiting the rebuilding\r\nand fitting of a fired house. I only hope this MS. may prove to be\r\nRussell’s original, as Mr Davenport has most kindly promised to let me\r\ncopy and print it for the Society. Meantime it is possible to consider\r\nJohn Russell’s Book of Norture as his own. For early poets and writers\r\nof verse seem to have liked this fiction of attributing their books to\r\nother people, and it is seldom that you find them acknowledging that\r\nthey have imagined their Poems on their own heads, as Hampole has it in\r\nhis _Pricke of Conscience_, p. 239, l. 8874 (ed. Morris, Philol. Soc.).\r\nEven Mr Tennyson makes believe that Everard Hall wrote his _Morte d’\r\nArthur_, and some Leonard his _Golden Year_. On the other hand, the\r\nexistence of the two Sloane MSS. is more consistent with Russell’s own\r\nstatement (if it is his own, and not his adapter’s in the Harleian MS.)\r\nthat he did not write his Boke himself, but only touched up another\r\nman’s. Desiring to let every reader judge for himself on this point,\r\nI shall try to print in a separate text[7], for convenience of\r\ncomparison, the Sloane MS. 1315, which differs most from Russell, and\r\nwhich the Keeper of the MSS. at the British Museum considers rather\r\nearlier (ab. 1440-50 A.D.) than the MS. of Russell (ab. 1460-70 A.D.),\r\nwhile of the earliest of the three, Sloane MS. 2027 (ab. 1430-40 A.D.),\r\nthe nearer to Russell in phraseology, I shall give a collation of all\r\nimportant variations. If any reader of the present text compares the\r\nSloanes with it, he will find the subject matter of all three alike,\r\nexcept in these particulars:\r\n\r\n  Sloane 1315.\r\n    --Sloane 2027.\r\n\r\n  Omits lines 1-4 of Russell.\r\n    --Contains these lines.\r\n\r\n  Inserts after l. 48 of R. a passage about behaviour which it nearly\r\n  repeats, where Russell puts it, at l. 276, _Symple Condicions_.\r\n    --Inserts and omits as Sl. 1315 does, but the wording is often\r\n      different.\r\n\r\n  Omits Russell’s stanza, l. 305-8, about ‘these cuttid galauntes with\r\n  their codware.’\r\n\r\n  Omits a stanza, l. 319-24, p. 21.2, b.).\r\n    --Contains this stanza (fol. 42, b.).\r\n\r\n  Contracts R.’s chapter on Fumositees, p. 23-4.\r\n    --Contracts the Fumositees too (fol. 45 and back).\r\n\r\n  Omits R.’s _Lenvoy_, under Fried Metes, p. 33-4.\r\n    --Has one verse of _Lenvoy_ altered (fol. 45 b.).\r\n\r\n  Transfers R.’s chapters on _Sewes on Fische Dayes_ and _Sawcis for\r\n  Fishe_, l. 819-54, p. 55-9, to the end of his chapter on _Kervyng of\r\n  Fishe_, l. 649, p. 45.\r\n    --Transfers as Sl. 1315 does (see fol. 48).\r\n\r\n  Gives different Soteltes (or Devices at the end of each course), and\r\n  omits Russell’s description of his four of the Four Seasons, p. 51-4;\r\n  and does not alter the metre of the lines describing the Dinners as\r\n  he does, p. 50-5.\r\n    --Differs from R., nearly as Sl. 1315 does.\r\n\r\n  Winds up at the end of the _Bathe or Stewe_, l. 1000, p. 69, R.,\r\n  with two stanzas of peroration. As there is no _Explicit_, the MS.\r\n  may be incomplete, but the next page is blank.\r\n    --Has 3 winding-up stanzas, as if about to end as Sloane 1315 does,\r\n      but yet goes on (omitting the _Bathe Medicinable_) with the\r\n      _Vssher and Marshalle_, R. p. 69, and ends suddenly, at l. 1062,\r\n      p. 72, R., in the middle of the chapter.\r\n\r\nIn occasional length of line, in words and rhymes, Sloane 1315 differs\r\nfar more from Russell than Sloane 2027, which has Russell’s long lines\r\nand rhymes throughout, so far as a hurried examination shows.\r\n\r\nBut the variations of both these Sloane MSS. are to me more like those\r\nfrom an original MS. of which our Harleian Russell is a copy, than of an\r\noriginal which Russell altered. Why should the earliest Sloane 2027\r\nstart with\r\n\r\n  “An vsschere .y. am / as ye may se : to a prynce Of hygh{e} degre”\r\n\r\nif in its original the name of the prince was not stated at the end, as\r\nRussell states it, to show that he was not gammoning his readers? Why\r\ndoes Sloane 1315 omit lines in some of its stanzas, and words in some of\r\nits lines, that the Harleian Russell enables us to fill up? Why does it\r\ntoo make its writer refer to the pupil’s lord and sovereign, if in its\r\noriginal the author did not clench his teaching by asserting, as Russell\r\ndoes, that he had served one? This Sloane 1315 may well have been copied\r\nby a man like Wynkyn de Worde, who wished not to show the real writer of\r\nthe treatise. On the whole, I incline to believe that John Russell’s\r\nBook of Norture was written by him, and that either the Epilogue to it\r\nwas a fiction of his, or was written by the superintender of the\r\nparticular copy in the Harleian MS. 4011, Russell’s own work terminating\r\nwith the _Amen!_ after line 1234.\r\n\r\nBut whether we consider Russell’s Boke another’s, or as in the main his\r\nown,--allowing that in parts he may have used previous pieces on the\r\nsubjects he treats of, as he has used _Stans Puer_ (or its original) in\r\nhis _Symple Condicions_, l. 277-304,--if we ask what the Boke contains,\r\nthe answer is, that it is a complete Manual for the Valet, Butler,\r\nFootman, Carver, Taster, Dinner-arranger, Hippocras-maker, Usher and\r\nMarshal of the Nobleman of the time when the work was written, the\r\nmiddle of the fifteenth century.--For I take the date of the composition\r\nof the work to be somewhat earlier than that of the MS. it is here\r\nprinted from, and suppose Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, “imprisoned and\r\nmurdered 1447,” to have been still alive when his Marshal penned\r\nit.--Reading it, we see “The Good Duke” rise and dress[8], go to Chapel\r\nand meals, entertain at feasts in Hall, then undress and retire to rest;\r\nwe hear how his head was combed with an ivory comb, his stomacher\r\nwarmed, his petycote put on, his slippers brown as the waterleech got\r\nready, his privy-seat prepared, and his urinal kept in waiting; how his\r\nbath was made, his table laid, his guests arranged, his viands carved,\r\nand his salt smoothed[9]; we are told how nearly all the birds that fly,\r\nthe animals that walk the earth, the fish that swim in river and sea,\r\nare food for the pot: we hear of dishes strange to us[10], beaver’s\r\ntail, osprey, brewe, venprides, whale, swordfish, seal, torrentyne, pety\r\nperveis or perneis, and gravell of beef[11]. Bills of fare for flesh and\r\nfish days are laid before us; admired Sotiltees or Devices are\r\ndescribed; and he who cares to do so may fancy for himself the Duke and\r\nall his brilliant circle feasting in Hall, John Russell looking on, and\r\ntaking care that all goes right.[12] I am not going to try my hand at\r\nthe sketch, as I do not write for men in the depths of that deducated\r\nPhilistinism which lately made a literary man say to one of our members\r\non his printing a book of the 15th century, “Is it possible that you\r\ncare how those barbarians, our ancestors, lived?” If any one who takes\r\nup this tract, will not read it through, the loss is his; those who do\r\nwork at it will gladly acknowledge their gain. That it is worthy of the\r\nattention of all to whose ears tidings of Early England come with\r\nwelcome sound across the wide water of four hundred years,\r\nI unhesitatingly assert. That it has interested me, let the time its\r\nnotes have taken on this, a fresh subject to me, testify. If any should\r\nobject to the extent of them[13], or to any words in them that may\r\noffend his ear, let him excuse them for the sake of what he thinks\r\nrightly present. There are still many subjects and words insufficiently\r\nillustrated in the comments, and for the names _venprides_ (l. 820);\r\n_sprotis_, (? sprats, as in Sloane 1315), and _torrentille_ (l. 548);\r\nalmond _iardyne_ (l. 744); ginger _colombyne_, _valadyne_, and\r\n_maydelyne_ (l. 132-3); leche _dugard_, &c., I have not been able to\r\nfind meanings. Explanations and helps I shall gladly receive, in the\r\nhope that they may appear in another volume of like kind for which I\r\ntrust soon to find more MSS. Of other MSS. of like kind I also ask for\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nThe reason for reprinting Wynkyn de Worde’s _Boke of Keruynge_, which I\r\nhad not at first thought of, was because its identity of phrase and word\r\nwith many parts of Russell,--a thing which came on me with a curious\r\nfeeling of surprise as I turned over the leaves,--made it certain that\r\nde Worde either abstracted in prose Russell’s MS., chopping off his\r\nlines’ tails,--adding also bits here[14], leaving out others there,--or\r\nelse that both writers copied a common original. The most cursory\r\nperusal will show this to be the case. It was not alone by happy chance\r\nthat when Russell had said\r\n\r\n  O Fruture viant / Fruter sawge byñ good /\r\n        bett{ur} is Frut{ur} powche;\r\n  Appulle fruture / is good hoot / but þe cold ye not towche\r\n\r\n    (l. 501-2)\r\n\r\nWynkyn de Worde delivered himself of\r\n\r\n  “Fruyter vaunte, fruyter say be good; better is fruyter pouche;\r\n  apple fruyters ben good good hote / and all colde fruters, touche\r\n  not,”\r\n\r\naltering _not’s_ place to save the rhyme; or that when Russell had said\r\nof the Crane\r\n\r\n  The Crane is a fowle / that strong{e} is w{i}t{h} to far{e};\r\n  þe whyng{es} ye areyse / full{e} large evyñ thar{e};\r\n  of hyr{e} trompe in þe brest / loke þ{a}t ye beware\r\n\r\nWynkyn de Worde directed his Carver thus: “A crane, reyse the wynges\r\nfyrst, & beware of the trumpe in his brest.” Let any one compare the\r\nsecond and third pages of Wynkyn de Worde’s text with lines 48-137 of\r\nRussell, and he will make up his mind that the old printer was either\r\none of the most barefaced plagiarists that ever lived, or that the same\r\noriginal was before him and Russell too. May Mr Davenport’s hayloft, or\r\nsome learned antiquarian, soon decide the alternative for us! The\r\nquestion was too interesting a “Curiosity of Literature” not to be laid\r\nbefore our Members, and therefore _The Boke of Keruynge_ was\r\nreprinted--from the British Museum copy of the second edition of\r\n1513--with added side-notes and stops, and the colophon as part of the\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\nThen came the necessary comparison of Russell’s Boke with the _Boke of\r\nCurtasye_, edited by Mr Halliwell from the Sloane MS. 1986 for the Percy\r\nSociety. Contrasts had to be made with it, in parts, many times in a\r\npage; the tract was out of print and probably in few Members’ hands; it\r\nneeded a few corrections[15], and was worthy of a thousand times wider\r\ncirculation than it had had; therefore a new edition from the MS. was\r\nadded to this volume. Relying on Members reading it for themselves,\r\nI have not in the notes indicated all the points of coincidence and\r\ndifference between this Boke and Russell’s. It is of wider scope than\r\nRussell’s, takes in the duties of outdoor officers and servants as well\r\nas indoor, and maybe those of a larger household; it has also a _fyrst\r\nBoke_ on general manners, and a _Second Book_ on what to learn at\r\nschool, how to behave at church, &c., but it does not go into the great\r\ndetail as to Meals and Dress which is the special value of Russell’s\r\nBoke, nor is it associated with a writer who tells us something of\r\nhimself, or a noble who in all our English Middle Age has so bright a\r\nname on which we can look back as “good Duke Humphrey.” This personality\r\nadds an interest to work that anonymity and its writings of equal value\r\ncan never have; so that we may be well content to let the _Curtasye_ be\r\nused in illustration of the _Nurture_. The MS. of the _Curtasye_ is\r\nabout 1460 A.D., Mr Bond says. I have dated it wrongly on the\r\nhalf-title.\r\n\r\n_The Booke of Demeanor_ was “such a little one” that I was tempted to\r\nadd it to mark the general introduction of handkerchiefs. Having printed\r\nit, arose the question, ‘Where did it come from?’ No Weste’s _Schoole of\r\nVertue_ could I find in catalogues, or by inquiring of the Duke of\r\nDevonshire, Mr W. C. Hazlitt, at the Bodleian, &c. Seager’s _Schoole of\r\nVertue_ was the only book that turned up, and this I accordingly\r\nreprinted, as Weste’s Booke of Demeanor seemed to be little more than an\r\nabstract of the first four Chapters of Seager cut down and rewritten. We\r\nmust remember that books of this kind, which we look on as sources of\r\namusement, as more or less of a joke, were taken seriously by the\r\npeople they were written for. That _The Schoole of Vertue_, for\r\ninstance--whether Seager’s or Weste’s--was used as a regular school-book\r\nfor boys, let Io. Brinsley witness. In his _Grammar Schoole_ of 1612,\r\npp. 17, 18, he enumerates the “Bookes to bee first learned of\r\nchildren”:-- 1. their Abcie, and Primer. 2. The Psalms in metre,\r\n‘because children wil learne that booke with most readinesse and delight\r\nthrough the running of the metre, as it is found by experience. 3. Then\r\nthe Testament.’ 4. “If any require any other little booke meet to enter\r\nchildren; _the Schoole of Vertue_ is one of the principall, and easiest\r\nfor the first enterers, being full of precepts of ciuilitie, and such as\r\nchildren will soone learne and take a delight in, thorow the roundnesse\r\nof the metre, as was sayde before of the singing Psalmes: And after it\r\n_the Schoole of good manners_[16], called, _the new Schoole of Vertue_,\r\nleading the childe as by the hand, in the way of all good manners.”\r\n\r\nI make no apology for including reprints of these little-known books in\r\nan Early English Text. _Qui s’excuse s’accuse_; and if these Tracts do\r\nnot justify to any reader their own appearance here, I believe the fault\r\nis not theirs.\r\n\r\nA poem on minding what you say, which Mr Aldis Wright has kindly sent\r\nme, some Maxims on Behaviour, &c., which all end in _-ly_, and Roger\r\nAscham’s Advice to his brother-in-law on entering a nobleman’s service,\r\nfollow, and then the Poems which suggested the _Forewords_ on Education\r\nin Early England, and have been partly noticed in them, p. i-iv. I have\r\nonly to say of the first, _The Babees Boke_, that I have not had time to\r\nsearch for its Latin original, or other copies of the text. Its\r\nspecialty is its attributing so high birth to the Bele Babees whom it\r\naddresses, and its appeal to Lady Facetia to help its writer. Of the\r\nshort alphabetic poems that follow,--_The A B C of Aristotle_,--copies\r\noccur elsewhere; and that in the Harleian Manuscript 1304, which has a\r\ndifferent introduction, I hope to print in the companion volume to this,\r\nalready alluded to. _Vrbanitatis_, I was glad to find, because of the\r\nmention of _the booke of urbanitie_ in Edward the Fourth’s Liber Niger\r\n(p. ii. above), as we thus know what the Duke of Norfolk of “Flodden\r\nField” was taught in his youth as to his demeanings, how mannerly he\r\nshould eat and drink, and as to his communication and other forms of\r\ncourt. He was not to spit or snite before his Lord the King, or wipe his\r\nnose on the table-cloth. The next tracts, _The Lytylle Chyldrenes Lytil\r\nBoke or Edyllys Be_[17] (a title made up from the text) and _The Young\r\nChildren’s Book_, are differing versions of one set of maxims, and are\r\nprinted opposite one another for contrast sake. _The Lytil Boke_ was\r\nprinted from a later text, and with an interlinear French version, by\r\nWynkyn de Worde in ‘_Here begynneth a lytell treatyse for to lerne\r\nEnglisshe and Frensshe_.’ This will be printed by Mr Wheatley in his\r\nCollection of Early Treatises on Grammar for the Society, as the copy in\r\nthe Grenville Library in the Brit. Mus. is the only one known. Other\r\ncopies of this Lytil Boke are at Edinburgh, Cambridge, and Oxford. Of\r\ntwo of these Mr David Laing and Mr Henry Bradshaw have kindly given me\r\ncollations, which are printed at the end of this Preface. Of the last\r\nPoem, _Stans Puer ad Mensam_, attributed to Lydgate-- as nearly\r\neverything in the first half of the 15th century was-- I have printed\r\ntwo copies, with collations from a third, the Jesus (Cambridge) MS.\r\nprinted by Mr Halliwell in _Reliquiæ Antiquæ_, v. 1, p. 156-8, and\r\nreprinted by Mr W. C. Hazlitt in his _Early Popular Poetry_, ii. 23-8.\r\nMr Hazlitt notices 3 other copies, in Harl. MS. 4011, fol. 1, &c.;\r\nLansdowne MS. 699; and Additional MS. 5467, which he collated for his\r\ntext. There must be plenty more about the country, as in Ashmole MS. 61,\r\nfol. 16, back, in the Bodleian.[18] Of old printed editions Mr Hazlitt\r\nnotes one “from the press of Caxton, but the only copy known is\r\nimperfect. It was printed two or three times by Wynkyn de Worde. Lowndes\r\nmentions two, 1518, 4to, and 1524, 4to; and in the public library at\r\nCambridge there is said by Hartshorne (_Book Rarities_, 156) to be a\r\nthird without date. It is also appended to the various impressions of\r\nthe _Boke of Nurture_ by Hugh Rhodes.” This _Boke_ has been reprinted\r\nfor the Early English Text Society, and its _Stans Puer_ is Rhodes’s own\r\nexpansion of one of the shorter English versions of the original\r\nLatin[19].\r\n\r\nThe woodcuts Messrs Virtue have allowed me to have copies of for a small\r\nroyalty, and they will help the reader to realize parts of the text\r\nbetter than any verbal description. The cuts are not of course equal to\r\nthe beautiful early illuminations they are taken from, but they are near\r\nenough for the present purpose. The dates of those from British Museum\r\nMSS. are given on the authority of trustworthy officers of the\r\nManuscript Department. The dates of the non-Museum MSS. are copied from\r\nMr Wright’s text. The line of description under the cuts is also from Mr\r\nWright’s text, except in one instance where he had missed the fact of\r\nthe cut representing the Marriage Feast at Cana of Galilee, with its six\r\nwater-pots.\r\n\r\nThe MS. of Russell is on thick folio paper, is written in a close--and\r\nseemingly unprofessional--hand, fond of making elaborate capitals to the\r\ninitials of its titles, and thus occasionally squeezing up into a corner\r\nthe chief word of the title, because the _T_ of _The_ preceding has\r\nrequired so much room.[20] The MS. has been read through by a corrector\r\nwith a red pen, pencil, or brush, who has underlined all the important\r\nwords, touched up the capitals, and evidently believed in the text.\r\nPerhaps the corrector, if not writer, was Russell himself. I hope it\r\nwas, for the old man must have enjoyed emphasizing his precepts with\r\nthose red scores; but then he would hardly have allowed a space to\r\nremain blank in line 204, and have left his Panter-pupil in doubt as to\r\nwhether he should lay his “white payne” on the left or right of his\r\nknives. Every butler, drill-serjeant, and vestment-cleric, must feel the\r\nthing to be impossible. The corrector was not John Russell.\r\n\r\nTo all those gentlemen who have helped me in the explanations of words,\r\n&c.,--Mr Gillett, Dr Günther, Mr Atkinson, Mr Skeat, Mr Cockayne,\r\nMr Gibbs, Mr Way, the Hon. G. P. Marsh--and to Mr E. Brock, the most\r\ncareful copier of the MS., my best thanks are due, and are hereby\r\ntendered. Would that thanks of any of us now profiting by their labours\r\ncould reach the ears of that prince of Dictionary-makers, Cotgrave, of\r\nFrater Galfridus, Palsgrave, Hexham, Philipps, and the rest of the\r\nlexicographers who enable us to understand the records of the past!\r\nWould too that an adequate expression of gratitude could reach the ears\r\nof the lost Nicolas, and of Sir Frederic Madden, for their carefully\r\nindexed Household Books,--to be contrasted with the unwieldy mass and\r\nclueless mazes of the Antiquaries’ _Household Ordinances_, the two\r\nvolumes of the Roxburghe _Howard Household Books_, and Percy’s\r\n_Northumberland Household Book[21]!_--They will be spared the pains of\r\nthe special place of torment reserved for editors who turn out their\r\nbooks without glossary or index. May that be their sufficient reward!\r\n\r\n  3, _St George’s Square_, N.W.\r\n\r\n    16 _Dec._, 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMPHREY, DUKE OF GLOUCESTER.\r\n\r\nMr C. H. Pearson has referred me to a most curious treatise on the state\r\nof Duke Humphrey’s body and health in 1404 (that is, 1424, says Hearne),\r\nby Dr Gilbert Kymer, his physician, part of which (chapters 3 and 19,\r\nwith other pieces) was printed by Hearne in the appendix to his _Liber\r\nNiger_, v. ii. p. 550 (_ed. alt._), from a MS. then in Sir Hans Sloane’s\r\nCollection, and now _Sloane_ 4 in the British Museum. It begins at p.\r\n127 or folio 63, and by way of giving the reader a notion of its\r\ncontents, I add here a copy of the first page of the MS.\r\n\r\n  Incipit dietariu{m} de sanitatis custodia p{re}inclitissi{m}o\r\n  p{r}incipi ac metuendissimo d{omi}no, d{omi}no humfrido, duci\r\n  Gloucestrie, Alijsq{ue} p{re}claris titulis insignito,\r\n  Sc{r}iptu{m} & co{m}pilatu{m}, p{er} ven{er}abile{m} doctore{m},\r\n  Magistru{m} Gilbertum Kymer, Medicinar{um} p{ro}fessorem, arciu{m}\r\n  ac ph{ilosoph}ie Mag{ist}r{u}m & in legib{us} bacallariu{m}\r\n  p{re}libati p{r}incipis phisicu{m}, Cui{us} dietarij[A]\r\n  c{ol}l{e}cc{i}o{n}em (?) dilucidancia & effectu{m} viginti sex\r\n  existu{n}t capit{u}la, q{u}or{um} {con}seque{n}t{er} hic ordo\r\n  ponit{ur} Rubricar{um}[B].\r\n\r\n    [Textnotes:\r\n    A: The letters are to me more like cł, or c{ol}l than anything\r\n    else, but I am not sure what they are.

It\r\ndescribes him in his 45th year, as having a rheumatic affection in his\r\nchest, with a daily morning cough. It mentions that his nerves had\r\nbecome debilitated by the vehemence of his laborious exercises, and from\r\nan immoderate frequency of pleasurable indulgences. It advises him to\r\navoid north winds after a warm sun, sleep after dinner, exercise after\r\nsociety, frequent bathings, strong wine, much fruit, the flesh of swine,\r\nand the weakening gratification to which he was addicted. The last\r\n(chapter), ‘De Deo semper colendo, ut sanitatem melius tueatur,’ is\r\nworthy the recollection of us all.” It is too late to print the MS. in\r\nthe present volume, but in a future one it certainly ought to appear.\r\n\r\nOf Duke Humphrey’s character and proceedings after the Pope’s bull had\r\ndeclared his first marriage void, Sharon Turner further says:\r\n\r\n“Gloucester had found the rich dowry of Jacqueline wrenched from his\r\ngrasp, and, from so much opposition, placed beyond his attaining, and he\r\nhad become satiated with her person. One of her attendants, Eleanor\r\nCobham, had affected his variable fancy; and tho’ her character had not\r\nbeen spotless before, and she had surrendered her honour to his own\r\nimportunities, yet he suddenly married her, exciting again the wonder of\r\nthe world by his conduct, as in that proud day every nobleman felt that\r\nhe was acting incongruously with the blood he had sprung from. His first\r\nwedlock was impolitic, and this unpopular; and both were hasty and\r\nself-willed, and destructive of all reputation for that dignified\r\nprudence, which his elevation to the regency of the most reflective and\r\nenlightened nation in Europe demanded for its example and its welfare.\r\nThis injudicious conduct announced too much imperfection of intellect,\r\nnot to give every advantage to his political rival the bishop of\r\nWinchester, his uncle, who was now struggling for the command of the\r\nroyal mind, and for the predominance in the English government. He and\r\nthe duke of Exeter were the illegitimate brothers of Henry the Fourth,\r\nand had been first intrusted with the king’s education. The internal\r\nstate of the country, as to its religious feelings and interest,\r\ncontributed to increase the differences which now arose between the\r\nprelate and his nephew, who is described by a contemporary as sullying\r\nhis cultivated understanding and good qualities, by an ungoverned and\r\ndiseasing love of unbecoming pleasures. It is strange, that in so old a\r\nworld of the same continuing system always repeating the same lesson,\r\nany one should be ignorant that the dissolute vices are the destroyers\r\nof personal health, comfort, character, and permanent influence.”[24]\r\n\r\nAfter narrating Duke Humphrey’s death, Turner thus sums up his\r\ncharacter:--\r\n\r\n“The duke of Gloucester, amid failings that have been before alluded to,\r\nhas acquired the pleasing epithet of The Good; and has been extolled for\r\nhis promotion of the learned or deserving clergy. Fond of literature,\r\nand of literary conversation, he patronized men of talent and erudition.\r\nOne is called, in a public record, his poet and orator; and Lydgate\r\nprefaces one of his voluminous works, with a panegyric upon him, written\r\nduring the king’s absence on his French coronation, which presents to us\r\nthe qualities for which, while he was living, the poet found him\r\nremarkable, and thought fit to commend him.”\r\n\r\nThese verses are in the Royal MS. 18 D 4, in the British Museum, and are\r\nhere printed from the MS., not from Turner:--\r\n\r\n    [Fol. 4.]\r\n  Eek in this lond--I dar afferme a thyng--\r\n  Ther is a prince Ful myhty of puyssau{n}ce,\r\n  A kynges sone, vncle to the kynge\r\n  Henry the sexte which is now i{n} frau{n}ce,\r\n  And is lieftenant, & hath the gouernau{n}ce\r\n  Off our breteyne; thoruh was discrecion\r\n  He hath conserued in this regiou{n}\r\n\r\n  Duryng his tyme off ful hih{e}[A] prudence\r\n  Pes and quiete, and sustened riht{e}.[A]\r\n  Ȝit natwithstandyng his noble prouyde{n}ce\r\n  He is in deede prouyd a good knyht,\r\n  Eied as argus with reson and forsiht;\r\n  Off hih{e} lectrure I dar eek off hym telle,\r\n  And treuli deeme that he doth{e} excelle\r\n\r\n  In vndirstondyng all othir of his age,\r\n  And hath gret Ioie with clerkis to co{m}mune;\r\n  And no man is mor expert off language.\r\n  Stable in studie alwei he doth contune,\r\n  Settyng a side alle chau{n}ges[B] of fortune;\r\n  And wher he loueth{e}, ȝiff I schal nat tarie,\r\n  With{e}oute cause ful loth{e} he is to varie.\r\n\r\n  Duc off Gloucestre men this prince calle;\r\n  And natwithstandyng his staat & dignyte,\r\n  His corage neuer doth appalle\r\n  To studie in bookis off antiquite;\r\n  Therin he hath{e} so gret felicite\r\n  Vertuousli hym silff to ocupie,\r\n  Off vicious slouth to haue the maistrie.[25]\r\n\r\n  And with his prudence & wit his manheed\r\n  Trouthe to susteyne he fauour set a side;\r\n  And hooli chirche meyntenyng in dede,\r\n  That in this land no lollard dar abide.\r\n  As verrai support, vpholdere, & eek guyde,\r\n  Spareth non, but maketh{e} hym silff strong\r\n  To punysshe alle tho that do the chirch{e} wrong.\r\n\r\n  Thus is he both manly & eek wise,\r\n  Chose of god to be his owne knyht{e};\r\n  And off o thynge he hath a synguler[C] price,\r\n  That heretik dar non comen in his siht{e}.\r\n  In cristes feith{e} he stant so hol vpriht,\r\n  Off hooli chirche defence and [c]hampion\r\n  To chastise alle that do therto treson.\r\n\r\n  And to do plesance to oure lord ih{es}u\r\n  He studieht[D] eu{er}e to haue intelligence.\r\n  Reedinge off bookis bringth{e} in vertu,--\r\n  Vices excludyng, slouthe & necligence,--\r\n  Maketh{e} a prince to haue experience\r\n  To know hym silff i{n} many sundry wise,\r\n  Wher he trespaseth, his errour to chastise.\r\n\r\n    [Text Notes:\r\n    A: These _e_-s represent the strokes through the _h_-s.\r\n    B: MS. thau{n}ges.\r\n    C: The _l_ is rubbed.\r\n    D: So in MS.]\r\n\r\nAfter mentioning that the duke had considered the book of ‘Boccasio, on\r\nthe Fall of Princes,’ he adds, ‘and he gave me commandment, that I\r\nshould, after my conning, this book translate him to do plesance.’ MS.\r\n18 D 4.--Sharon Turner’s _History of England_, vol. vi. pp. 55--7.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. When printing the 1513 edition of Wynkyn de Worde’s _Boke of\r\nKeruynge_, I was not aware of the existence of a copy of the earlier\r\nedition in the Cambridge University Library. Seeing this copy afterwards\r\nnamed in Mr Hazlitt’s new catalogue, I asked a friend to compare the\r\npresent reprint with the first edition, and the result follows.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE ON THE 1508 EDITION OF\r\n\r\n_The Boke of Keruynge_,\r\n\r\nBy The Rev. Walter Skeat, M.A.\r\n\r\nThe title-page of the older edition, of 1508, merely contains the words,\r\n“¶ Here begynneth the boke of Keruynge;” and beneath them is--as in the\r\nsecond edition of 1513--a picture of two ladies and two gentlemen at\r\ndinner, with an attendant bringing a dish, two servants at a side table,\r\nand a jester. The colophon tells us that it was “Enprynted by wynkyn de\r\nworde at London in Flete strete at the sygne of the sonne. The yere of\r\nour lorde M.CCCCC.VIII;” beneath which is Wynkyn de Worde’s device, as\r\nin the second edition.\r\n\r\nThe two editions resemble each other very closely, running page for page\r\nthroughout, and every folio in the one begins at the same place as in\r\nthe other. Thus the word “moche” is divided into mo-che in both\r\neditions, the “-che” beginning Fol. A. ii. b. Neither is altogether\r\nfree from misprints, but these are not very numerous nor of much\r\nimportance. It may be observed that marks of contraction are hardly ever\r\nused in the older edition, the word “y^e” being written “the” at length,\r\nand instead of “hãged” we find “hanged.” On the whole, the first edition\r\nwould seem to be the more carefully printed, but the nature of the\r\nvariations between them will be best understood by an exact collation of\r\nthe first two folios (pp. 151-3 of the present edition), where the\r\nreadings of the first edition are denoted by the letter A. The only\r\nvariations are these:--\r\n\r\n  P. 151.\r\n    _lyft_ that swanne] _lyfte_ that swanne A (_a misprint_).\r\n    _frusshe_ that chekyn] _fruche_ that chekyn A.\r\n    thye all maner _of_ small byrdes] A _omits_ of.\r\n    _fynne_ that cheuen] _fyne_ that cheuen A.\r\n    _transsene_ that ele] _trassene_ that ele A.\r\n    Here _hendeth_, &c.] Here _endeth_, &c. A.\r\n    _Butler_] Butteler A.\r\n\r\n  P. 152,\r\n    l. 5. _tre{n}choures_] trenchours A.\r\n    l. 12. _ha{n}ged_] hanged A.\r\n    l. 15. _cannelles_] canelles A.\r\n    l. 18, 19. _y^e_] the (_in both places_) A.\r\n    l. 20. _seasous_] seasons A.\r\n    l. 23. _after_] After A.\r\n    l. 27. _good_] goot A.\r\n    l. 30. _y^e_] the A.\r\n    l. 34. _modo{n}_] modon A.\r\n    l. 36. _sourayne_] souerayne A.\r\n\r\n  P. 153. _ye_] the A (_several times_).\r\n    l. 5. _wyll_] wyl A.\r\n    l. 9. _rede_] reed A. _reboyle_] reboyle not A.\r\n    l. 12. _the_ reboyle] _they_ reboyle A.\r\n    l. 17. _lessynge_] lesynge A.\r\n    l. 20. _ca{m}polet_] campolet A.\r\n    l. 21. _tyer_] tyerre A.\r\n    l. 22. _ypocras_] Ipocras A (_and in the next line, and l. 26_).\r\n    l. 24. _gy{n}ger_] gynger A.\r\n    l. 27. _ren_] hange A.\r\n    l. 29. _your_] youre A.\r\n  _In l._ 33, A _has_ paradico, _as in the second edition._\r\n\r\nIt will be readily seen that these variations are chiefly in the\r\nspelling, and of a trivial character. The only ones of any importance\r\nare, on p. 151, _lyste_ (which is a misprint) for _lyft_, and _trassene_\r\nfor _transsene_ (cp. Fr. _transon_, a truncheon, peece of, Cot.); on p.\r\n152, _goot_ for _good_ is well worth notice (if any meaning can be\r\nassigned to _goot_), as the direction to beware of _good_ strawberries\r\nis not obvious; on p. 153, we should note _lesynge_ for _lessynge_, and\r\n_hange_ for _ren_, the latter being an improvement, though _ren_ makes\r\nsense, as basins hung by cords on a perch may, like curtains hung on a\r\nrod, be said to _run_ on it. The word _ren_ was probably caught up from\r\nthe line above it in reprinting.\r\n\r\nThe following corrections are also worth making, and are made on the\r\nauthority of the first edition:--\r\n\r\n  P. 155,\r\n    l. 10, _For_ treachour _read_ trenchour.\r\n    l. 23. _For_ so _read_ se.\r\n    l. 24. _For_ se’ _read_ se.\r\n  P. 156,\r\n    l. 1. _ony_] on A.\r\n    l. 7. _For_ it _read_ is.\r\n    l. 15. _y^e so_] and soo A.\r\n      (_No doubt owing to confusion between & and_ y^e.)\r\n    l. 16. _your_] you A.\r\n    l. 29. _For_ bo _read_ be.\r\n  P. 157,\r\n    l. 20. _For_ wich _read_ with.\r\n  P. 158,\r\n    l. 3. _For_ fumosytces _read_ fumosytees.\r\n    l. 7. _For_ pygous _read_ pynyons (whence it appears that\r\n      the _pinion_-bones, not _pigeon’s_-bones, are meant).\r\n    l. 25. The word “reyfe” is quite plain.\r\n\r\nP. 160, ll. 18, &c. There is some variation here; the first edition\r\nhas, after the word _souerayne_, the following:--“laye trenchours before\r\nhym / yf he be a grete estate, lay fyue trenchours / & he be of a lower\r\ndegre, foure trenchours / & of an other degre, thre trenchours,” &c.\r\nThis is better; the second edition is clearly wrong about _five_\r\ntrenchers. This seems another error made in reprinting, the words\r\n_lower degre_ being wrongly repeated.\r\n\r\n  P. 161,\r\n    l. 6. It may be proper to note the first edition also has _broche_.\r\n  P. 165,\r\n    l. 8. _For_ for y^e _read_ for they.\r\n  P. 165,\r\n    l. 27. _the[y]_; _in_ A they _is printed in full._\r\n  P. 166,\r\n    l. 18. _For_ raysyus _read_ raysyns.\r\n  P. 167,\r\n    l. 21. _For_ slytee _read_ slytte.\r\n  P. 169,\r\n   ll. 10, 18. _carpentes_] carpettes A.\r\n    l. 14. _shall_] shake A.\r\n    l. 23. _blanked_] blanket A.\r\n\r\nNearly all the above corrections have already been made in the\r\nside-notes. Only two of them are of any importance, viz. the\r\nsubstitution of _pynyons_ on p. 158, and the variation of reading on\r\np. 160; in the latter case perhaps neither edition seems quite right,\r\nthough the first edition is quite intelligible.\r\n\r\nIn our Cambridge edition (see p. 170, l. 5) this line about the pope is\r\ncarefully struck out, and the grim side-note put “_lower down_”, with\r\ntags to show to what estate he and the cardinal and bishops ought to be\r\ndegraded!\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOTE TO p. xxiv. l. 10, “OUR WOMEN,”\r\n  AND THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF LANGUAGES, p. xxv-vi.\r\n\r\n    [These pages can be found under the headnote\r\n    “NEGLECT OF EDUCATION BY MOTHERS”.]\r\n\r\nThe Ladies & Men of Queen Elizabeth’s Court.\r\n\r\n    “I might here (if I would, or had sufficient disposition of matter\r\n    conceiued of the same) make a large discourse of such honorable\r\n    ports, of such graue councellors, and noble personages, as giue\r\n    their dailie attendance vpon the quéenes maiestie there. I could\r\n    in like sort set foorth a singular commendation of the vertuous\r\n    beautie, or beautifull vertues of such ladies and gentlewomen as\r\n    wait vpon hir person, betweene whose amiable countenances and\r\n    costlinesse of attire, there séemeth to be such a dailie conflict\r\n    and contention, as that it is verie difficult for me to gesse,\r\n    whether of the twaine shall beare awaie the preheminence. This\r\n    further is not to be omitted, to the singular commendation of both\r\n    sorts and sexes of our courtiers here in England, [a] that there\r\n    are verie few of them, which haue not the vse and skill of sundrie\r\n    speaches, beside an excellent veine of writing before time not\r\n    regarded. Would to God the rest of their liues and conuersations\r\n    were correspondent to these gifts! for as our common courtiers\r\n    (for the most part) are the best lerned and indued with excellent\r\n    gifts, so are manie of them the worst men when they come abroad,\r\n    that anie man shall either heare or read of. Trulie it is a rare\r\n    thing with vs now, to heare of a courtier which hath but his owne\r\n    language. [b] And to saie how many gentlewomen and ladies there\r\n    are, that beside sound knowledge of the Gréeke and Latine toongs,\r\n    are thereto no lesse skilfull in the Spanish, Italian, and French,\r\n    or in some one of them, it resteth not in me: sith I am persuaded,\r\n    that as the noble men and gentlemen doo surmount in this behalfe,\r\n    so these come verie little or nothing at all behind them for their\r\n    parts; which industrie God continue, and accomplish that which\r\n    otherwise is wanting!\r\n\r\n    [Sidenotes ([b] bracketed in original):\r\n    [a] English courtiers the best learned & the worst liuers.\r\n    [[b] Ladies learned in languages.]]\r\n\r\n    “[a] Beside these things I could in like sort set downe the waies\r\n    and meanes, wherby our ancient ladies of the court doo shun and\r\n    auoid idlenesse, some of them exercising their fingers with the\r\n    needle, other in caul-worke, diuerse in spinning of silke, some in\r\n    continuall reading either of the holie scriptures, or histories of\r\n    our owne or forren nations about vs, and diuerse in writing\r\n    volumes of their owne, or translating of other mens into our\r\n    English and Latine toong, [b] whilest the yoongest sort in the\r\n    meane time applie their lutes, citharnes, prickesong, and all kind\r\n    of musike, which they vse onelie for recreation sake, when they\r\n    haue leisure, and are frée from attendance vpon the quéenes\r\n    maiestie, or such as they belong vnto. [c] How manie of the eldest\r\n    sort also are skilfull in surgerie and distillation of waters,\r\n    beside sundrie other artificiall practises perteining to the\r\n    ornature and commendations of their bodies, I might (if I listed\r\n    to deale further in this behalfe) easilie declare, but I passe\r\n    ouer such maner of dealing, least I should séeme to glauer, and\r\n    currie fauour with some of them. Neuerthelesse this I will\r\n    generallie saie of them all, that as [d] ech of them are cuning in\r\n    somthing wherby they kéepe themselues occupied in the court, so\r\n    there is in maner none of them, but when they be at home, can\r\n    helpe to supplie the ordinarie want of the kitchen with a number\r\n    of delicat dishes of their owne deuising, [e] wherein the\r\n    Portingall is their chéefe counsellor, as some of them are most\r\n    commonlie with the clearke of the kitchen, who vseth (by a tricke\r\n    taken vp of late) [f] to giue in a bréefe rehearsall of such and\r\n    so manie dishes as are to come in at euerie course throughout the\r\n    whole seruice in the dinner or supper while: which bill some doo\r\n    call a [g] memoriall, other a billet, but some a fillet, bicause\r\n    such are commonlie hanged on the file, and kept by the ladie or\r\n    gentlewoman vnto some other purpose.

Dr Rock says that the _holyn_ or holly and _erbere grene_ refer\r\nto the change on Easter Sunday described in the _Liber Festivalis_:--\r\n“In die paschẽ. Good friends ye shall know well that this day is called\r\nin many places God’s Sunday. Know well that it is the manner in every\r\nplace of worship at this day _to do the fire out of the hall;_ and the\r\nblack winter brands, and all thing that is foul with smoke shall be done\r\naway, and there the fire was, shall be gaily arrayed with fair flowers,\r\nand strewed with green rushes all about, showing a great ensample to all\r\nChristian people, like as they make clean their houses to the sight of\r\nthe people, in the same wise ye should cleanse your souls, doing away\r\nthe foul brenning (burning) sin of lechery; put all these away, and cast\r\nout all thy smoke, dusts; and strew in your souls flowers of faith and\r\ncharity, and thus make your souls able to receive your Lord God at the\r\nFeast of Easter.” --Rock’s _Church of the Future_, v. iii. pt. 2,\r\np. 250. “The holly, being an evergreen, would be more fit for the\r\npurpose, and makes less litter, than the boughs of deciduous trees.\r\nI know some old folks in Herefordshire who yet follow the custom, and\r\nkeep the grate filled with flowers and foliage till late in the autumn.”\r\n--D. R. On Shere-Thursday, or _Cena Domini_, Dr Rock quotes from the\r\n_Liber Festivalis_--“First if a man asked why Sherethursday is called\r\nso, ye may say that in Holy Church it is called ‘Cena Domini,’ our\r\nLord’s Supper Day; for that day he supped with his disciples openly....\r\nIt is also in English called Sherethursday; for in old fathers’ days the\r\npeople would that day sheer their heads and clip their beards, and poll\r\ntheir heads, and so make them honest against Easter-day.” --Rock, _ib._,\r\np. 235.

If Yarde =\r\n    _Virga_; then it is Marshmallow, or Malva Sylvestris; if yarde =\r\n    erde, earth; then the rotundifolia. --254 (3): PARITORY is\r\n    Pellitory of the wall, _parietaria_. Wall pellitory abounds in\r\n    nitrate of potass. There are two other pellitories: ‘P. of\r\n    Spain’--this is _Pyrethrum_, which the Spanish corrupted into\r\n    _pelitre_, and we corrupted _pelitre_ into pellitory.

Lately, in France, they have\r\n    been administered internally against epilepsy. --263 (12):\r\n    BRESEWORT; if = brisewort or bruisewort, it would be _Sambucus\r\n    Ebulus_, but this seems most unlikely. --265 [_unlabeled, 1 on\r\n    next page_] BROKELEMPK = brooklime. _Veronica Beccabunga_,\r\n    formerly considered as an anti-scorbutic applied externally.

Neither do I meane this of\r\nsmall wines onlie, as _Claret_, White, Red, French, &c., which amount to\r\nabout fiftie-six sorts, according to the number of regions from whence\r\nthey come: but also of the thirtie kinds of Italian, Grecian, Spanish,\r\nCanarian, &c., whereof _Vernage_, _Cate_, _pument_, _Raspis_,\r\n_Muscadell_, _Romnie_, _Bastard_, _Tire_, _Oseie_, _Caprike_, _Clareie_,\r\nand _Malmesie_, are not least of all accompted of, bicause of their\r\nstrength and valure. For as I haue said in meat, so the stronger the\r\nwine is, the more it is desired, by means wherof in old time, the best\r\nwas called _Theologicum_, because it was had from the cleargie and\r\nreligious men, vnto whose houses manie of the laitie would often send\r\nfor bottels filled with the same, being sure that they would neither\r\ndrinke nor be serued of the worst, or such as was anie waies mingled or\r\nbrued by the vintener: naie the merchant would haue thought that his\r\nsoul{e} should haue gone streight-waie to the diuell, if he should haue\r\nserued them with other than the best.”\r\n\r\nOn Wine, see also Royal Rolls, B.M. 14 B. xix.\r\n\r\nβ. Specially: The following extracts are from Henderson’s _History of\r\nAncient and Modern Wines_, 1824, except where otherwise stated:--\r\n\r\n1. _Vernage_ was a red wine, of a bright colour, and a sweetish and\r\nsomewhat rough flavour, which was grown in Tuscany and other parts of\r\nItaly, and derived its name from the thick-skinned grape, _vernaccia_\r\n(corresponding with the _vinaciola_ of the ancients), that was used in\r\nthe preparation of it (See Bacci. Nat. Vinor. Hist., p. 20, 62). It is\r\nhighly praised by Redi.[*]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote *: Vernage was made in the Genoese territory. The best\r\n    was grown at San Gemignano, and in Bacci’s time was in great\r\n    request at Rome. The wine known as Vernaccia in Tuscany was always\r\n    of a white or golden colour. _Henderson_, p. 396.]\r\n\r\n2. _Vernagelle_ is not mentioned by Henderson. The name shows it to have\r\nbeen a variety of Vernage.\r\n\r\n3. l. 118. _Cute._ “As for the _cuit_ named in Latin Sapa, it commeth\r\nneere to the nature of wine, and in truth nothing els it is, but Must or\r\nnew wine boiled til one third part and no more do remain; & this _cuit_,\r\nif it be made of white Must is counted the better.” _Holland’s Plinies\r\nNat. Hist._, p. 157. “(of the dried grape or raisin which they call\r\nAstaphis).... The sweet _cuit_ which is made thereof hath a speciall\r\npower and virtue against the Hæmorrhois alone, of all other serpents,”\r\np. 148. “Of new pressed wine is made the wine called _Cute_, in Latin,\r\n_Sapa_; and it is by boiling the new pressed wine so long, as till that\r\nthere remaine but one of three parts. Of new pressed wine is also made\r\nanother _Cute_, called of the Latines _Defrutum_, and this is by boiling\r\nof the new wine onely so long, as till the halfe part be consumed, and\r\nthe rest become of the thicknesse of honey.” _Maison Rustique_, p. 622.\r\n‘Cute. A.S. _Cæren_, L. _carenum_, wine boiled down one-third, and\r\nsweetened.’ Cockayne, Gloss. to Leechdoms.\r\n\r\n4. _Pyment._ In order to cover the harshness and acidity common to the\r\ngreater part of the wines of this period, and to give them an agreeable\r\nflavour, it was not unusual to mix honey and spices with them. Thus\r\ncompounded they passed under the generic name of _piments_,[†] probably\r\nbecause they were originally prepared by the _pigmentarii_ or\r\napothecaries; and they were used much in the same manner as the\r\n_liqueurs_ of modern times. _Hend._ p. 283.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote †: See the recipe for making Piment in Halliwell’s\r\n    Dictionary, s.v.]\r\n\r\nThe varieties of Piment most frequently mentioned are the\r\n\r\n_Hippocras & Clarry._ The former was made with either white or red wine,\r\nin which different aromatic ingredients were infused; and took its name\r\nfrom the particular sort of bag, termed Hippocrates’s Sleeve, through\r\nwhich it was strained.... _Clarry_, on the other hand, which (with wine\r\nof _Osey_) we have seen noticed in the Act 5 Richard II. (St. 1, c. 4,\r\n_vin doulce, ou clarre_), was a claret or mixed wine, mingled with\r\nhoney, and seasoned in much the same way, as may be inferred from an\r\norder of the 36th of Henry III. respecting the delivery of two casks of\r\nwhite wine and one of red, to make _Clarry_ and other liquors for the\r\nking’s table at York (duo dolia albi vini et garhiofilacum et unum\r\ndolium rubri vini ad _claretum_ faciend{um}). _Henderson_, p. 284.\r\n_Hippocras_, vinum Aromaticum.

Olde men may\r\ndrynke, as I sayde, hygh wynes at theyr pleasure. Furthermore all swete\r\nwynes, and grose wynes, doth make a man fatte.”\r\n\r\n7. _Rompney._ Henderson, p. 288, says, “Another of the above-mentioned\r\nwines (in _the Squire of Low Degree_) designated by the name of the\r\ngrape, was the Romenay, otherwise Romenay, Rumney, Romaine, or Romagnia.\r\nThat it could not be the produce of the Ecclesiastical State, as the two\r\nlast corruptions of the word would seem to imply, may be safely averred;\r\nfor at no period, since the decline of the empire, has the Roman soil\r\nfurnished any wines for exportation; and even Bacci, with all his\r\npartiality, is obliged to found his eulogy of them on their ancient\r\nfame, and to confess that, in his time, they had fallen into disrepute.”\r\nHe argues also against the notion that this wine came from Romana in\r\nAragon, and concludes that it was probably a Greek wine, as Bacci (_Nat.\r\nVin. Hist._ p. 333) tells us that the wine from the Ioinan Islands and\r\nadjoining continent was called in Italian _Romania_,--from the Saracen\r\n_Rum-ili_. Now this is all very well, but how about the name of _Rompney\r\nof Modene_ or Modena, just outside the Western boundary of the\r\nRomagna,--not Meudon, in France, “amongst all the wines which we use at\r\nParis, as concerning the red, the best are those of Coussy, Seure,\r\nVaunes, and _Meudon_.” Maison Rustique, p. 642.--Who will hold to John\r\nRussell, and still consider _Romney_ an Italian wine? _Rumney_, vinum\r\nresinatum. Withals.\r\n\r\n8. _Bastard._ Henderson argues against the above-quoted (No. 6)\r\nsupposition of Charles Etienne’s (which is supported by Cotgrave’s _Vin\r\nmiellé_, honied wine, _bastard_, Metheglin, sweet wine), and adopts\r\nVenner’s account (_Via Recta ad Vitam Longam_), that “Bastard is in\r\nvirtue somewhat like to muskadell, and may also in stead thereof be\r\nused; it is in goodness so much inferiour to muskadell, as the same is\r\nto malmsey.” It took its name, Henderson thinks, from the grape of which\r\nit was made, probably a bastard species of muscadine. “One of the\r\nvarieties of vines now cultivated in the Alto Douro, and also in\r\nMadeira, is called _bastardo_, and the must which it yields is of a\r\nsweetish quality.” Of the Bastard wine there were two sorts,--white and\r\nbrown (brown and white bastard, _Measure for Measure_, Act iii. sc. 2),\r\nboth of them, according to Markham’s report, “fat and strong; the tawny\r\nor brown kind being the sweetest.” In _The Libelle of Englysch Polycye_,\r\nA.D. 1436 (Wright’s _Political Songs_, v. 2, p. 160), ‘wyne bastarde’ is\r\nput among the commodyetees of Spayne.\r\n\r\n9. _Tire_, if not of Syrian growth, was probably a Calabrian or Sicilian\r\nwine, manufactured from the species of grape called _tirio_. _Tyre_,\r\nvinum Tyrense, ex Tyro insula. Withals.\r\n\r\n10. _Ozey._ Though this is placed among the “commodities of Portugal”\r\nin some verses inserted in the first volume of Hackluyt’s Voyages,\r\np. 188--Her land hath wine, _osey_, waxe, and grain,--yet, says\r\nHenderson, “a passage in Valois’ Description of France, p. 12, seems to\r\nprove, beyond dispute, that _oseye_ was an Alsatian wine; _Auxois_ or\r\n_Osay_ being, in old times, the name constantly used for Alsace. If\r\nthis conjecture is well-founded, we may presume that _oseye_ was a\r\nluscious-sweet, or straw-wine, similar to that which is still made in\r\nthat province. That it was a rich, high-flavoured liquor is sufficiently\r\nshown by a receipt for imitating it, which may be seen in Markham\r\n(_English Housewife_, 1683, p, 115), and we learn from Bacci p. 350)\r\nthat the wines which Alsace then furnished in great profusion to England\r\nas well as different parts of the continent, were of that description.\r\nIn the ‘Bataille des Vins’ we find the ‘Vin d’_Aussai_’ associated with\r\nthe growths of the Moselle.” _Osey_ is one ‘Of the commoditees of\r\nPortingalle,’ _Libelle_, p. 163.\r\n\r\n11. _Torrentyne of Ebrew._ Is this from Tarentum, Tarragon, or Toledo?\r\nWhence in Ebrew land did our forefathers import wine? Mr G. Grove says,\r\n“I should at first say that Torrentyne referred to the wine from some\r\nwady (Vulgate, _torrens_) in which peculiarly rich grapes grew, like the\r\nwady of Eschcol or of Sorek; but I don’t remember any special valley\r\nbeing thus distinguished as ‘_The_ Torrent’ above all others, and the\r\nvineyards are usually on hill-sides, not in vallies.”\r\n\r\n12. _Greke Malevesyñ._ “The best dessert wines were made from the\r\nMalvasia grape; and Candia, where it was chiefly cultivated, for a long\r\ntime retained the monopoly,” says Henderson. He quotes Martin Leake to\r\nexplain the name. Monemvasia is a small fortified town in the bay of\r\nEpidaurus Limera. “It was anciently a promontory called Minoa, but is\r\nnow an island connected with the coast of Laconia by a bridge. The name\r\nof _Monemvasia_, derived from the circumstances of its position (μόνη\r\nἐμβασία, single entrance), was corrupted by the Italians to _Malvasia_;\r\nand the place being celebrated for the fine wines produced in the\r\nneighbourhood, _Malvasia_ changed to _Malvoisie_ in French, and\r\n_Malmsey_ in English came to be applied to many of the rich wines of the\r\nArchipelago, Greece, and other countries.” (_Researches in Greece_,\r\np. 197.) _Maulmsey_, vinum creticum, vel creteum.

Do not yawn or gape, or even sneeze,\r\nif you can avoid it; and as to hawking and spitting, the name of such a\r\nthing is enough to forbid it, without a command. When you are standing\r\nbehind a person, to be ready to change the plates, &c., do not put your\r\nhands on the back of the chair, as it is very improper; though I have\r\nseen some not only do so, but even beat a kind of tune upon it with\r\ntheir fingers. Instead of this, stand upright with your hands hanging\r\ndown or before you, but not folded. Let your demeanour be such as\r\nbecomes the situation which you are in. Be well dressed, and have light\r\nshoes that make no noise, your face and hands well washed, your\r\nfinger-nails cut short and kept quite clean underneath; have a\r\nnail-brush for that purpose, as it is a disgusting thing to see black\r\ndirt under the nails.

The Bittern was formerly in some estimation\r\nas an article of food for the table; the flesh is said to resemble that\r\nof the Leveret in colour and taste, with some of the flavour of wild\r\nfowl.

Stretch yourself. 2. Rub yourself. 3. Go to stool. 4. Put on\r\n    your clothes. 5. Comb your head.]\r\n\r\n(6) Picke and rub your teeth: and because I would not haue you to bestow\r\nmuch cost in making dentrifices for them; [a] I will aduertise you by\r\nfoure rules of importance how to keepe your teeth white and vncorruyt\r\n(_sic_), and also to haue a sweete breath. First, wash well your mouth\r\nwhen you haue eaten your meat: secondly, sleepe with your mouth somewhat\r\nopen. Thirdly, spit out in the morning that which is gathered together\r\nthat night in the throate: then take a linnen cloth, and rub your teeth\r\nwell within and without, to take away the fumositie of the meat and the\r\nyellownesse of the teeth. For it is that which putrifieth them and\r\ninfecteth the breath. But least peraduenture your teeth become loose and\r\nfilthy, I will shew you [b] a water farre better then pouders, which\r\nshall fasten them, scoure the month, make sound the gums, and cause the\r\nflesh to growe againe, if it were fallen away. Take halfe a glasse-full\r\nof vineger, and as much of the water of the mastick tree (if it may\r\neasily be gotten) of rosemarie, myrrhe, mastick, bole Armoniake, Dragons\r\nherbe, roche allome, of each of them an ounce; of fine cinnamon halfe an\r\nounce, and of fountaine water three glassefulles; mingle all well\r\ntogether and let it boile with a small fire, adding to it halfe a pound\r\nof honie, and taking away the scumme of it; then put in a little\r\nbengwine, and when it hath sodden a quarter of an houre, take it from\r\nthe fire, and keepe it in a cleane bottle, and wash your teeth\r\ntherewithall as well before meate as after; if you hould some of it in\r\nyour mouth a little while, it doth much good to the head, and sweetneth\r\nthe breath. I take this water to be [c] better worth then a thousand of\r\ntheir dentifrices.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenotes:\r\n    6. Clean your teeth.\r\n    [a] (How to keep the teeth sound and the breath sweet. [b] Use\r\n    Vaughan’s Water made after this recipe. [c] It’s better than\r\n    1000 Dentrifices.)]\r\n\r\n(7) Wash your face, eyes, eares and hands, with fountaine water. I have\r\nknowne diuers students which vsed to bathe their eyes onely in well\r\nwater twise a day, whereby they preserued their eyesight free from all\r\npassions and bloudsheds, and sharpened their memories maruaylously. You\r\nmay sometimes bathe your eyes in rosewater, fennell water, or eyebright\r\nwater, if you please; but I know for certaintie, that you neede them not\r\nas long as you vse good fountaine water. Moreouer, least you by old age\r\nor some other meanes doe waxe dimme of sight, I will declare vnto you,\r\n[a] the best and safest remedie which I knowe, and this it is: Take of\r\nthe distilled waters of verueine, bettonie, and fennell one ounce and a\r\nhalfe, then take one ounce of white wine, one drachme of Tutia (if you\r\nmay easilie come by it) two drachmes of sugarcandy, one drachme of Aloes\r\nEpatick, two drachmes of womans milke, and one scruple of Camphire: beat\r\nthose into pouder, which are to be beaten, and infuse them together for\r\nfoure and twenty houres space, and then straine them, and so vse it when\r\nyou list.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenotes:\r\n    7. Wash. [a] The best remedy for dim sight.]\r\n\r\n(8) When you haue finished these, say your morning prayers, and desire\r\nGod to blesse you, to preserue you from all daungers, and to direct you\r\nin all your actions. For the feare of God (as it is written) is the\r\nbeginning of wisedome: and without his protection whatsoeuer you take in\r\nhand, shall fall to ruine. Therefore see that you be mindfull of him,\r\nand remember that to that intent you were borne, to weet, to set foorth\r\nhis glorie and most holy name.\r\n\r\n(9) Goe about your businesse circumspectly, and endeauour to banish all\r\ncares and cogitations, which are the onely baits of wickednesse. [a]\r\nDefraud no man of his right: for what measure you giue vnto your\r\nneighbour, that measure shall you receiue. And finally, imprint this\r\nsaying deepely in your mind: A man is but a steward of his owne goods;\r\nwherof God one day will demaund an account.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenotes:\r\n    8. Say your Prayers. 9. Set to work. [a] Be honest.]\r\n\r\n(10) Eate three meales a day vntill you come to the age of fourtie\r\nyeares: as, your breakefast, dinner, and supper; yet, that betweene\r\nbreakefast and dinner there be the space of foure houres, and betwixt\r\ndinner and supper seauen houres: the breakfast must be lesse then\r\ndinner, and the dinner somewhat lesse then supper.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote:\r\n    10. Eat only three meals a day.]\r\n\r\n[a] In the beginning of meales, eate such meates as will make the belly\r\nsoluble, and let grosse meats be the last. Content your selfe with one\r\nkind of meate, for diuersities hurt the body, by reason that meats are\r\nnot all of one qualitie: Some are easily digested, others againe are\r\nheauy, and will lie a long time vpon the stomack: also, the eating of\r\nsundrie sorts of meat require often [b] pottes of drinke, which hinder\r\nconcoction; like as we see often putting of water into the meat-potte to\r\nhinder it from seething. Our stomack is our bodies kitchin, which being\r\ndistempered, how can we liue in temperate order: drinke not aboue foure\r\ntimes, and that moderately, at each meale: least the belly-God hale you\r\nat length captiue into his prison house of gurmandise, where you shall\r\nbe afflicted with as many diseases as you haue deuoured dishes of sundry\r\nsorts. [c] The cups whereof you drinke, should be of siluer, or siluer\r\nand gilt.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenotes:\r\n    [a] Eat light food before heavy. [b] Drink hinders digestion.\r\n    [c] Use silver cups.]\r\n\r\n(11) Labour not either your mind or body presently after meales: rather\r\nsit a while and discourse of some pleasant matters: when you haue ended\r\nyour confabulations, wash your face and mouth with cold waters, then go\r\nto your chamber, and make cleane your teeth with your tooth-picker,\r\nwhich should be either of iuorie, silver, or gold. Watch not too long\r\nafter supper, but depart within two hours to bed. But if necessitie\r\ncompell you to watch longer then ordinary, then be sure to augment your\r\nsleepe the next morning; that you may recompence nature, which otherwise\r\nthrough your watching would not a little be impaired.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote:\r\n    11. Don’t work directly after meals, but talk, wash, and clean\r\n    your teeth.]\r\n\r\n(12) Put of your clothes in winter by the fire side: and cause your bed\r\nto bee heated with a warming panne: vnless your pretence bee to harden\r\nyour members, and to apply your selfe vnto militarie discipline. This\r\noutward heating doth wonderfully comfort the inward heat, it helpeth\r\nconcoction, and consumeth moisture.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote:\r\n    12. Undress by the fire in winter.]\r\n\r\n(13) Remember before you rest, to chew down two or three drachmes of\r\nmastick: for it will preserue your body from bad humours.\r\n\r\n(14) Pray feruently to God, before you sleepe, to inspire you with his\r\ngrace, to defend you from all perils and subtelties of wicked fiends,\r\nand to prosper you in all your affaires: and then lay aside your cares\r\nand businesse, as well publicke as priuate: for that night, in so doing,\r\nyou shall slepe more quietly. Make water at least once, and cast it out:\r\nbut in the morning [a] make water in an vrinal: that by looking on it,\r\nyou may ghesse some what of the state of your body. Sleep first on your\r\nright side with your mouth open, and [b] let your night cappe haue a\r\nhole in the top, through which the vapour may goe out.\r\n\r\n(15) In the morning remember your affayres, and if you be troubled with\r\nrheumes, as soone as you haue risen, vse diatrion piperion, or eate\r\nwhite pepper now and then, and you shall be holpen.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FINIS.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenotes:\r\n    13.

Then [b] rub the whole body somewhat with the palmes, the\r\nbrest, back and belly gently, but the armes and legs with the hands,\r\neither with warm linnen: [c] next, the head is to be scrubbed fro{m} the\r\nforepart to the hinderpart very lightly. After you are risen, I will\r\nthat you [d] defend with all care and diligence your head, necke, and\r\nfeet, from all cold in the morning; for there is no doubt, but in the\r\nmorning and euening the cold doth offend more, then it doth about noone\r\ntide, by reason of the weaknes of the Sun-beames. [e] Put on your\r\nclothes neat and cleane: in the Summer season, first wash with cleane\r\npure water, before described; [f] but in the Winter season sit somewhat\r\nby the fire, not made with turfe or stinking coale, but with oake or\r\nother wood that burneth cleare, for our bodies are somewhat affected\r\nwith our clothes, and as strength is increased by the vse of meat and\r\ndrinke, and our life defended and preserued; and so our garments doe\r\nconserue the heat of our hodies, and doe driue away colds: so that as\r\ndiet and apparel may seeme alike, so in either of them a like diligence\r\nis to be preferred.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenotes:\r\n    [a] Stretch your limbs, [b] rub your body [c] and head; [d] protect\r\n    yourself from cold; [e] dress, washing in Summer, [f] warming\r\n    yourself in Winter.]\r\n\r\n[a] In the Summer-time I chiefly commend garments [Page 37.] of\r\nHarts-skinnes, and Calues-skins, for the Hart is a creature of long\r\nlife, and resisteth poyson and Serpents; therefore I my selfe vse\r\ngarments of the like sort for the winter season, also neuerthelesse\r\nlined with good linnen. Next I doe iudge it not to bee much amisse to\r\nvse garments of Silke or Bombace, or of purple: also of Martyn or [b]\r\nWolfe-skinnes, or made of Fox skinnes, I suppose to be good for the\r\nwinter; notwithstanding in the time of Pestilence, apparell of Silke and\r\nskinnes is condemned, because it doth easily admit and receiue the\r\ncontagious ayre, and doth retain it long. After the body is well\r\nclothed, [c] kembe your head wel with an Iuory comb, from the forehead\r\nto the backe-part, drawing the comb some forty times at the least; then\r\n[d] wash all the instruments of the sences, as the eies, the ears, the\r\nnostrils, the mouth, the tongue, the teeth, and all the face with cold\r\nwater; and the eyes are not only to be washed, but being open plainly,\r\nimmerg’d: and [e] the gumme and foulnes of the eie-lids that do there\r\nstick, to remoue; somtimes also to besprinkle the water with Rose-water\r\nor Fenel-water, also [f] rubb the neck well with [* Page 38.] a linnen\r\nnapking somewhat course, for these things doe confirme the whole body;\r\nit maketh the mind more cheerefull, and conserueth the sight.

Auoid also from the nostrils and the lungs all\r\nfilthy matter, as wel by clensing, as by spittle, and [b] clense the\r\nface, head, and whole body; & loue you to be cleane and wel apparelled,\r\nfor from our cradles let vs abhor vncleannes, which neither nature or\r\nreason can endure.

For _Aristotle_ doth affirme, and so doth\r\nAlbertus Magnus, that a Smaragd worne about the necke, is good against\r\nthe Falling-sicknes: for [e] surely the vertue of an hearbe is great,\r\nbut much more the vertue of a precious [* Page 43.] stone, which is\r\nvery likely that they are endued with occult and hidden vertues.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenotes:\r\n    [a] Work in the forenoon.

[b] In the time betweene dinner and supper, abstain\r\naltogether from cups, vnlesse necessitie or custome doe require the\r\nsame: notwithstanding the same custome being so vitious, must be by\r\nlittle and little changed.\r\n\r\n[c] I would not that you should obserue a certaine houre, either for\r\ndinners or suppers, as I haue sufficiently told you before, lest that\r\ndaily custome should be altered into nature: and after this intermission\r\nof this custome of nature, hurt may follow; for custome doth imitate\r\nnature, and that which is accustomable, the very same thing is now\r\nbecome naturall.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenotes:\r\n    [a] Eat only twice a day.

A.D. 1513.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWynkyn de Worde introduces some dishes, sauces, fish, and one wine, not\r\nmentioned by Russell.\r\n\r\nThe new _Dishes_ are--\r\n\r\n_Fayge_ (p. 157, l. 10). This may be for _Sage_, the herb, or a variety\r\nof Fritter, like _Fruyter vaunte_ (p. 157, l. 2; p. 159, l. 24),\r\n_fruyter say_ (p. 159, l. 24), or a dish that I cannot find, or a way of\r\nspelling figs.\r\n\r\n_Fruyter say_, p. 159, l. 24. If _say_ is not for _Sage_, then it may be\r\na fish, contrasted with the _vaunte_, which I suppose to mean ‘meat.’\r\n_Sey_ is a Scotch name for the Coalfish, _Merlangus Carbonarius_.\r\nYarrell, ii. 251.\r\n\r\n_Charlet_ (p. 159, l. 28). The recipe in ‘Household Ordinances,’ p. 463,\r\nis, Take swete cowe mylk and put into a panne, and cast in therto ȝolkes\r\nof eyren and the white also, and sothen porke brayed, and sage; and let\r\nhit boyle tyl hit crudde, and colour it with saffron, and dresse hit up,\r\nand serve hit forthe.” Another recipe for Charlet Enforsed follows, and\r\nthere are others for Charlet and Charlet icoloured, in Liber Cure,\r\np. 11.\r\n\r\n_Jowtes_, p. 160, last line. These are broths of beef or fish boiled\r\nwith chopped boiled herbs and bread, _H. Ord._ p. 461. Others are made\r\n‘with swete almond mylke,’ _ib._ See ‘Joutus de Almonde,’ p. 15, _Liber\r\nCure_. For ‘Joutes’ p. 47; ‘for oþer ioutes,’ p. 48.\r\n\r\n_Browes_, p. 160, last line. This is doubtless the Brus of Household\r\nOrdinances, p. 427, and the _bruys_ of Liber Cure, p. 19, l. 3, brewis,\r\nor broth. Brus was made of chopped pig’s-inwards, leeks, onions, bread,\r\nblood, vinegar. For ‘Brewewes in Somere’ see _H. Ord._ p. 453.\r\n\r\n_Chewettes_, p. 161, l. 4, were small pies of chopped-up livers of pigs,\r\nhens, and capons, fried in grease, mixed with hard eggs and ginger, and\r\nthen fried or baked. _Household Ordinances_, p. 442, and _Liber Cure_,\r\np. 41. The Chewets for fish days were similar pies of chopped turbot,\r\nhaddock, and cod, ground dates, raisins, prunes, powder and salt, fried\r\nin oil, and boiled in sugar and wine. _L. Cure_, p. 41. Markham’s Recipe\r\nfor ‘A Chewet Pye’ is at p. 80-1 of his _English Houswife_. _Chewit_, or\r\nsmall Pie; minced or otherwise. R. Holme. See also two recipes in MS.\r\nHarl. 279, fol. 38.\r\n\r\n_Flaunes_ (p. 161, l. 4) were Cheesecakes, made of ground cheese beaten\r\nup with eggs and sugar, coloured with saffron, and baked in ‘cofyns’ or\r\ncrusts. ‘A Flaune of Almayne’ or ‘Crustade’ was a more elaborate\r\npreparation of dried or fresh raisins and pears or apples pounded, with\r\ncream, eggs, bread, spices, and butter, strained and baked in ‘a faire\r\ncoffyn or two.’ _H. Ord._ p. 452. [[‘Pro Caseo ad _flauns_ qualibet die\r\n. panis j’ (allowance of). _Register of Worcester Priory_, fol. 121 _a._\r\ned. Hale, 1865.]]\r\n\r\nOf new _Sauces_, Wynkyn de Worde names _Gelopere_ & _Pegyll_ (p. 165,\r\nl. 4). Gelopere I cannot find, and can only suggest that its _p_ may be\r\nfor _f_, and that “cloves of gelofer,” the clove-gillyflower, may have\r\nbeen the basis of it. These cloves were stuck in ox tongues, see “Lange\r\nde beof,” _Liber Cure_, p. 26. Muffett also recommends Gilly-flour\r\nVinegar as the best sauce for sturgeon in summer, p. 172; and Vinegar of\r\nClove-Gilliflowers is mentioned by Culpepper, p. 97, Physical Directory,\r\n1649.\r\n\r\n_Pegylle_ I take to be the _Pykulle_ of Liber Cure Cocorum, p. 31, made\r\nthus;\r\n\r\n  ‘Take droppyng of capone rostyd wele\r\n  With wyne and mustarde, as have Þou cele [bliss],\r\n  With onyons smalle schrad, and sothun in grece,\r\n  Meng alle in fere, and forthe hit messe.’\r\n\r\nThe new _Wine_ is _Campolet_, p. 153. Henderson does not mention it;\r\nHalliwell has ‘_Campletes_. A kind of wine, mentioned in a curious list\r\nin MS. Rawl. C. 86.’ [See the list in the Notes to Russell, above,\r\np. 86.] I suppose it to be the wine from ‘_Campole_. The name of a\r\ncertaine white grape, which hath very white kernels.’ Cotgrave.\r\n\r\nOf new _Fish_ W. de Worde names the _Salens_ (p. 166, l. 8), _Cottell_\r\nand _Tench_ (p. 167). Torrentyne he makes _sele turrentyne_ (p. 166,\r\nl. 8 from bottom) seemingly, but has _turrentyne salte_ as a fish\r\nsalted, at p. 168, l. 7.\r\n\r\n_Cottell_, p. 168, l. 14, the cuttlefish. Of these, _Sepiæ vel\r\nLolligines calamariæ_, Muffet says, they are called also ‘sleewes’ for\r\ntheir shape, and ‘scribes’ for their incky humour wherewith they are\r\nreplenished, and are commended by Galen for great nourishers; their\r\nskins be as smooth as any womans, but their flesh is brawny as any\r\nploughmans; therefore I fear me Galen rather commended them upon\r\nhear-say then upon any just cause or true experience.\r\n\r\nFor the _Salens_ I can only suggest thunny. Aldrovandi, _de Piscibus_,\r\ntreating of the synonyms of the Salmon, p. 482, says, “Græcam salmonis\r\nnomenclaturam non inuenio, neq{ue} est quod id miretur curiosus lector,\r\ncum in Oceano tantu{m} flumi{n}ibusq{ue} in eum se exonerantibus\r\nreperiatur, ad quæ veteres Græci nunquam penetr{a}runt. Qui voluerit,\r\n_Salangem_ appellare poterit. Σαλάχξ enim boni, id est, delicati piscis\r\nnomen legitur apud Hesychium, nec præterea qui sit, explicatur: aut a\r\nmigrandi natura κατανάδρομος, vel δρόμας fluviatilis dicatur, nam\r\nAristoteles in mari dromades vocat Thunnos aliosq{ue} gregales, qui\r\naliunde in Pontum excurrunt, et vix vno loco conquiescunt; aut nomen\r\nfingatur a saltu, & ἄλμων dicitur. Non placet tamen, salmonis nomen a\r\nsaltu deduci, aut etiam á sale, licet saliendi natura ei optimè quadret\r\nsaleq{ue} aut muria inueturaria etiam soleat. Non enim latine sed a\r\nGermanis Belgisuè Rheni accolis, aut Gallis Aquitanicis accepta vox\r\nest.” See also p. 318, ‘Scardula, et Iucohia ex Pigis, et Plota,\r\nSale{n}a.’ _Gesner, de Piscibus_, p. 273. Can _salens_ be the Greek\r\n‘σωλην, a shell-fish, perhaps like the razor-fish. Epich.\r\np. 22.’--Liddell and Scott--? I presume not. ‘_Solen._ The flesh is\r\nsweet; they may be eaten fryed or boiled.’ 1661, R. Lovell, _Hist. of\r\nAnimals_, p. 240. ‘_Solen_: A genus of bivalve mollusks, having a long\r\nslender shell; razor-fish.’ Webster’s Dict.\r\n\r\n_Sele turrentyne_, p. 166, l. 8 from bottom. Seemingly a variety of\r\nseal, or of eel or sole if _sele_ is a misprint. But I cannot suggest\r\nany fish for it.\r\n\r\n_Rochets_, p. 167, l. 5. _Rubelliones._ _Rochets_ (or rather Rougets,\r\nbecause they are so red) differ from Gurnards and Curs, in that they are\r\nredder by a great deal, and also lesser; they are of the like flesh and\r\ngoodness, yet better fryed with onions, butter, and vinegar, then\r\nsodden. Muffett, p. 166.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote L*: See above, in the Keruynge of Flesshe, p. 157,\r\n    lines 5 and 4 from the bottom.

He\r\ndiffers from Mr Brock and me in reading _drunkelewe_ (drunken, in\r\nChaucer, &c.) as ‘drunke, lewe,’ and _vessels_ as ‘bossels,’ and in\r\nadding _e_’s[1] to some final _g_’s. He says, by way of Introduction,\r\nthat, “Though entitled Ordinances for the Household of Bishop Grostete,\r\nthis is evidently a Letter addressed to the Bishop on the management of\r\nhis Household by some very intimate friend. From the terms used in the\r\nLetter, it is clear that the writer must have been on confidential terms\r\nwith the Prelate. I cannot affirm positively that the writer was Adam de\r\nMarisco, although to no other would this document be attributed with\r\ngreater probability. No one else enjoyed such a degree of Grostete’s\r\naffection; none would have ventured to address him with so much\r\nfamiliarity. Besides, the references made more than once by Adam de\r\nMarisco in his letters to the management of the Bishop’s household,\r\ngreatly strengthen this supposition. See pp. 160, 170 (_Mon.\r\nFrancisc._). The MS. is a small quarto on vellum, in the writing of the\r\n15th century. It is in all probability a translation from a Latin\r\noriginal.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: In this he is probably right. The general custom of\r\n    editors justifies it.

Here follows part of it, from Whitaker’s Hist.\r\nof Richmondshire, p. 282.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst and formost, in all your thoughts, words, and deeds, [a]have\r\nbefore your eyes the feare of God..... [b] love and serve your lord\r\nwillingly, faithfullye, and secretlye; love and live with your fellowes\r\nhonestly, quiettlye, curteouslye, that noe man have cause either to hate\r\nyow for your stubborne frowardnes, or to malice yow for your proud\r\nungentlenes, two faults which co{m}monly yonge men soones[t] fall into\r\nin great men’s service. [c] Contemne noe poore man, mocke noe simple\r\nman, w{hi}ch proud fooles in cort like and love to doe; find fault with\r\nyour selfe and with none other, the best waye to live honestlye and\r\nquiettly in the court. [d] Carrye noe tales, be noe co{m}mon teller of\r\nnewes, be not inquisitive of other menn’s talke, for those that are\r\ndesirous to heare what they need not, co{m}monly be readye to babble\r\nwhat they shold not. [e] Vse not to lye, for that is vnhonest; speake\r\nnot everye truth, for that is vnneedfull; yea, in tyme and place a\r\nharmlesse lye is a greate deale better then a hurtfull truth. [f] Use\r\nnot dyceing nor carding; the more yow use them the lesse yow wilbe\r\nesteemed; the cunninger yow be at them the worse man yow wilbe counted.\r\n[g] for pastime, love and learne that w{hi}ch your lord liketh and vseth\r\nmost, whether itt be rydeing, shooteing, hunting, hawkeing, fishing or\r\nany such exercise. Beware of secrett corners and night sitting vp, the\r\ntwo nurses of mischiefe, unthriftines, losse, and sicknes. [h] Beware\r\ncheifely of ydlenes, the great pathway that leadeth directly to all\r\nevills; be diligent alwayes, be present every where in your lord’s\r\nservice, [i] be at hand to call others, and be not ofte sent for\r\nyourselfe; for marke this as part of your creed, that the good service\r\nof one whole yeare shall never gett soe much as the absence of one howre\r\nmay lose, when your lord shall stand in need of yow to send. if yow\r\nconsider alwayes that absence and negligence must needes be cause of\r\ngreife and sorrowe to your selfe, of chideing and rueing to your lord,\r\nand that [k] dutye done diligently and presently shall gaine yow\r\nprofitt, and purchase yow great praise and your lord’s good countenance,\r\nyow shall ridd me of care, and wynne your selfe creditt, make me a gladd\r\nman, and your aged mother a ioyfull woman, and breed your freinds great\r\ncomforth.

[7] All virtues are included in it.\r\n    [9] See that your hands and nails are clean. [11] Don’t eat till\r\n    grace is said, or sit down till you’re told. [15] First, think on\r\n    the poor; the full belly wots not what the hungry feels. [19] Don’t\r\n    eat too quickly. [21] Touch nothing till you are fully helped.\r\n    [23] Don’t break your bread in two, [26] or put your pieces in your\r\n    pocket, your fingers in the dish, or your meat in the salt-cellar.\r\n    [33] Don’t pick your ears or nose, [35] or drink with your mouth\r\n    full, [38] or cram it full. [39] Don’t pick your teeth with your\r\n    knife. [41] Take your spoon out when you’ve finished soup.\r\n    [43] Don’t spit over or on the table, that’s not proper. [45] Don’t\r\n    put your elbows on the table, [47] or belch as if you had a bean in\r\n    your throat. [49] Be careful of good food; and be courteous and\r\n    cheerful. [54] Don’t whisper in any man’s ear. Take your food with\r\n    your fingers, and don’t waste it. [57] Don’t grin, or talk too\r\n    much, or spill your food. [61] Keep your cloth before you. [63] Cut\r\n    your meat, don’t bite it. [65] Don’t open your mouth too wide when\r\n    you eat, [68] or blow in your food. [69] If your lord drinks,\r\n    always wait till he has done. [73] Keep your trencher clean.\r\n    [75] Drink behind no man’s back. [77] Don’t rush at the cheese,\r\n    [79] or throw your bones on the floor. [82] Sit still till grace\r\n    is said [84] and you’ve washed your hands, [87] and don’t spit in\r\n    the basin. [89] Rise quietly, don’t jabber, [91] but thank your\r\n    host and all the company, [95] and then men will say, ‘A gentleman\r\n    was here!’ [97] He who despises this teaching isn’t fit to sit at\r\n    a good man’s table.

[5] Courtesy came from heaven, and contains all virtues, as\r\n    rudeness does all vices. [11] Get up betimes; cross yourself; wash\r\n    your hands and face; comb your hair; say your prayers; [17] go to\r\n    church and hear Mass. [19] Say ‘Good Morning’ to every one you\r\n    meet. [21] Then have breakfast, first crossing your mouth. [25] Say\r\n    grace, thank Jesus for your food, [29] and say an Ave for the souls\r\n    in pain. [31] Then set to work, and don’t be idle. [33] Scripture\r\n    tells you, if you work, you must eat what you get with your hands.\r\n    [39] Be true in word and deed; [41] truth keeps a man from blame.\r\n    [44] Mercy and Truth are the two ways to heaven, fail not to go by\r\n    them. [47] Make only proper promises, and keep them without\r\n    falsehood. [51] Love God and your neighbours, and so fulfil all the\r\n    Law. [55] Meddle only with what belongs to you. [57] Scorn not the\r\n    poor; flatter no one; [60] oppress (?) not servants. Be meek, and\r\n    [63] wait till your better has spoken. [65] When you speak to a man,\r\n    keep still, and look him in the face. [70] Don’t be a tale-bearer.\r\n    [71] Thank all who speak well of you. [73] Use few words; don’t\r\n    swear or lie in your dealings. [79] Earn money honestly, and keep\r\n    out of debt. [81] Try to please; seek peace; mind whom you speak\r\n    to and what you say. [85] Wherever you enter, say “God be here;”\r\n    and speak courteously to master and man. [89] Stand till you are\r\n    told to sit at meat, and don’t leave your seat before others.\r\n    [93] Sit upright; be sociable, and share with your neighbours.\r\n    [97] Take salt with a clean knife; [99] talk no scandal, but speak\r\n    well of all. [101] Hear and see; don’t talk. [103] Be satisfied with\r\n    what’s set before you. [105] Wipe your mouth before you drink;\r\n    [107] keep your fingers and lips clean. [109] Don’t speak with your\r\n    mouth full. [112] Praise your food for whether it’s good or bad, it\r\n    must be taken in good part. [115] Mind where you spit, [117] and put\r\n    your hand before your mouth. [119] Keep your knife clean, and don’t\r\n    wipe it on the cloth. [125] Don’t put your spoon in the dish, or\r\n    make a noise, like boys, when you sup. [129] Don’t put meat off\r\n    your plate into the dish, but into a voider. [133] If your superior\r\n    hands you a cup, drink, but take the cup with two hands. [137] When\r\n    he speaks to you, doff your cap and bend your knee. [139] Don’t\r\n    scratch yourself at table, wipe your nose, [145] or play with your\r\n    spoon, &c. [147] This book is for young children who don’t stay\r\n    long at school.

Walter Sneyd’s copy of Mr Davenport Bromley’s MS._]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber’s Note:\r\n\r\nIn long paragraphs, sidenotes are labeled [a], [b]... Numbered\r\nsidenotes are from the original text.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Sneyd has just told me that Mr Arthur Davenport’s MS. _How to serve a\r\nLord_, referred to in my Preface to Russell, p. lxxii., is in fact the\r\none from Mr Sneyd’s copy of which his sister quoted in her edition of\r\nthe ‘Italian Relation of England’ mentioned on pp. xiv. xv. of my\r\n_Forewords_. Mr Sneyd says: ‘I made my copy nearly forty years ago,\r\nduring the lifetime of the late Mr A. Davenport’s grandfather, who was\r\nmy uncle by marriage. I recollect that the MS. contains a miscellaneous\r\ncollection of old writings on various subjects, old recipes, local and\r\nfamily memoranda, &c., all of the 15th century, and, bound up with them\r\nin the old vellum wrapper, is an imperfect copy of the first edition of\r\nthe Book of St Alban’s. On Mr Arthur Davenport’s death, last September,\r\nthe MS. (with the estates) came into the possession of Mr Davenport\r\nBromley, M.P., but a long time must elapse before it can be brought to\r\nlight, as the house you mention is still unfinished, and the boxes of\r\nbooks stowed away in confusion.’ On my asking Mr Sneyd for a sight of\r\nhis copy, he at once sent it to me, and it proved so interesting--\r\nespecially the Feast for a Bride, at the end-- that I copied it out\r\ndirectly, put a few notes to it, and here it is.[1] For more notes and\r\nexplanations the reader must look the words he wants them for, out in\r\nthe Index at the end of Part II. The date of the Treatise seems to me\r\nquite the end of the 15th century, if not the beginning of the 16th. The\r\nintroduction of the Chamber, p. 356, the confusion of the terms of a\r\nCarver, ‘unlose _or_ tire _or_ display,’ p. 357--enough to make a\r\nwell-bred Carver faint: even Wynkyn de Worde in 1508 and 1513 doesn’t\r\nthink of such a thing--the cheese shred with sugar and sage-leaves,\r\np. 355, the ‘Trenchours of _tree or_ brede,’ l. 16, below, &c., as well\r\nas the language, all point to a late date. The treatise is one for a\r\nless grand household than Russell, de Worde, and the author of the _Boke\r\nof Curtastye_ prescribed rules for. But it yields to none of the books\r\nin interest: so in the words of its pretty ‘scriptur’ let it welcome all\r\nits readers:\r\n\r\n  “Welcombe you bretheren godely in this hall!\r\n  Joy be unto you all\r\n  that en[2] this day it is now fall!\r\n  that worthy lorde that lay in an Oxe stalle\r\n  mayntayne your husbonde and you, w{i}t{h} your gystys all!”\r\n\r\n\r\n  [I. _Of laying the Cloth and setting out the Table._]\r\n\r\nFfirst, in servise of all thyngys in pantery and botery, and also for\r\nthe ewery. ffirst, table-clothis, towelles longe and shorte,\r\ncovertours[3] and napkyns, be ordeyned clenly, clene and redy accordyng\r\nto the tyme.

He\r\nsays, “Here is a case in which nothing but parallel arrangement can\r\nafford a clue to the apparent confusion. The people who used these\r\nservices were so thoroughly accustomed to them, that a word or two was\r\nenough to remind them of what was to follow--sometimes a whole series of\r\nprayers, or verses and responds, or suffrages. If your object is to give\r\npeople of the present day an idea of the meaning of these things, it is\r\nalmost useless to print them straight as they are in the MS. Even as I\r\nhave written them out, _inserting_ nothing whatever except the names of\r\nthe speakers in a bracket, you will perhaps not catch much of the\r\nthread. You may remember that at Trinity even now it takes two people to\r\nsay what is substantially the same Grace as this.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber’s Note:\r\n\r\nThe following section was printed in columns on five sets of facing\r\npages, labeled 1.1, 1.2... In this e-text the four versions are\r\ninterlocked, distinguished by different indentations; notations such\r\nas [[1.2, 1.3, 1.4 same]] in double brackets mean that the remaining\r\ncolumns contain the same text.

for the house,\r\nthree-day bread; for trenchers four-day bread; Have your salt white, and\r\nyour salt-planer of ivory, two inches broad, three long.\r\nHave your table linen sweet and clean, your knives bright, spoons well\r\nwashed, two wine-augers some box taps, a broaching gimlet, a pipe and\r\nbung.\r\nTo broach a pipe, pierce it with an auger or gimlet, four fingers-\r\nbreadth over the lower rim, so that the dregs may not rise.\r\nServe Fruit according to the season, figs, dates, quince-marmalade,\r\nginger, &c.\r\nBefore dinner, plums and grapes after, pears, nuts, and hard cheese.\r\nAfter supper, roast apples, &c.\r\nIn the evening don’t take cream, strawberries, or junket, unless you eat\r\nhard cheese with them.\r\nHard cheese keeps your bowels open.\r\nButter is wholesome in youth and old age, anti-poisonous, and aperient.\r\nMilk, Junket, Posset, &c., are binding.\r\nEat hard cheese after them.\r\nBeware of green meat; it weakens your belly.\r\nFor food that sets your teeth on edge, eat almonds and cheese, but not\r\nmore than half an ounce.\r\nIf drinks have given you indigestion, eat a raw apple.\r\nModeration is best sometimes, at others abstinence.\r\nLook every night that your wines don’t ferment or leak Always carry a\r\ngimlet, adze, and linen cloths; and wash the heads of the pipes with\r\ncold water.\r\nIf the wine boil over, put to it the lees of red wine, and that will\r\ncure it.\r\nRomney will bring round sick sweet wine.\r\n\r\n_The names of Sweet Wines._\r\n\r\n_Recipe for making Ypocras._\r\nTake spices thus, Cinnamon, &c., long Pepper.\r\nHave three basins and three straining-bags to them; hang ’em on a perch.\r\nLet your ginger be well pared, hard, not worm-eaten, (Colombyne is\r\nbetter than Valadyne or Maydelyne); your sticks of Cinnamon thin, hot\r\nand sweet; Canel is not so good.\r\nCinnamon is hot and dry, Cardamons are hot and moist.\r\nTake sugar or sugar candy, red wine, graines, ginger, pepper, cinnamon,\r\nspice, and turnesole, and put each powder in a bladder by itself.\r\nHang your straining-bags so that they mayn’t touch,--first bag a gallon,\r\nothers a pottle.\r\nPut the powders in two or three gallons of red wine; then into the\r\nrunner, the second bag, (tasting and trying it now and then), and the\r\nthird vessel.\r\nIf it’s not right, add cinnamon, ginger, or sugar, as wanted.\r\nIf it’s not right, add cinnamon, ginger, or sugar, as wanted.\r\nMind you keep tasting it.\r\nStrain it through bags of fine cloth, hooped at the mouth, the first\r\nholding a gallon, the others a pottle, and each with a basin under it.\r\nThe Ypocras is made.\r\nUse the dregs in the kitchen.\r\nPut the Ypocras in a tight clean vessel, and serve it with wafers.\r\n\r\n_The Buttery._\r\nKeep all cups, &c., clean.\r\nDon’t serve ale till it’s five days old.\r\nBe civil and obliging, and give no one stale drink.\r\n\r\n_To lay the cloth_, &c.\r\nWipe the table.\r\nPut a cloth on it (a cowche); you take one end, your mate the other; lay\r\nthe fold of the second cloth(?) on the outer edge of the table, that of\r\nthe third cloth(?) on the inner.\r\nCover your cupboard with a diaper towel, put one round your neck, one\r\nside on your left arm with your sovereign’s napkin; on that, eight\r\nloaves to eat, and three or four trencher loaves: in your left the\r\nsalt-cellar.\r\nIn your right hand, spoons and knives.\r\nPut the Salt on the right of your lord; on its left, a trencher or two;\r\non their left, a knife, then white rolls, and beside them a spoon folded\r\nin a napkin.\r\nCover all up.\r\nAt the other end set a Salt and two trenchers.\r\n\r\n_How to wrap up your lord’s bread in a stately way._\r\nCut your loaves all equal.\r\nTake a towel two and a half yards long by the ends, fold up a handful\r\nfrom each end, and in the middle of the folds lay eight loaves or buns,\r\nbottom to bottom; put a wrapper on the top, twist the ends of the towel\r\ntogether, smooth your wrapper, and quickly open the end of it before\r\nyour lord.\r\nAfter your lord’s lay the other tables.\r\nDeck your cupboard with plate, your washing-table with basins, &c.\r\nHave plenty of napkins, &c., and your pots clean.\r\nMake the _Surnape_ with a cloth under a double napkin.\r\nFold the two ends of your towel, and one of the cloth, a foot over, and\r\nlay it smooth for your lord to wash with.\r\nThe marshal must slip it along the table, and pull it smooth.\r\nThen raise the upper part of the towel, and lay it even, so that the\r\nSewer (arranger of dishes) may make a state.\r\nWhen your lord has washed, take up the Surnape with your two arms, and\r\ncarry it back to the Ewery.\r\nCarry a towel round your neck.\r\nUncover your bread; see that all diners have knife, spoon, and napkin.\r\nBow when you leave your lord.\r\nTake eight loaves from the bread-cloth, and put four at each end.\r\nLay for as many persons as the Sewer has set potages for, and have\r\nplenty of bread and drink.\r\nBe lively and soft-spoken, clean and well dressed.\r\nDon’t spit or put your fingers into cups.\r\nStop all blaming and backbiting, and prevent complaints.\r\n\r\n_General Directions for Behaviour._\r\nDon’t claw your back as if after a flea;

lay four trenchers four-square,\r\nand another on the top.\r\nTake a loaf of light bread, pare the edges, cut the upper crust for your\r\nlord, and don’t touch it after it’s trimmed.\r\nKeep your table clean.\r\n\r\n_Indigestibilities._\r\nYou must know what meat is indigestible, and what sauces are wholesome.\r\nThese things are indigestible: Fat and Fried, Raw and Resty, Salt and\r\nSour, also sinews, skin, hair, feathers, crops, heads, pinions, &c.,\r\nlegs, outsides of thighs, skins;

Defend us\r\nthis day. Let us abound with virtues, flee from vice, and go forward in\r\ngood doing to our live’s end.”\r\nRepeat the Lord’s Prayer night and morning.\r\n\r\n_How to wash and dress yourself._\r\nDon’t sleep too long.\r\nRise early; cast up your bed, and don’t let it lie.\r\nGo down, salute your parents, wash your hands, comb your head, brush\r\nyour cap and put it on.\r\nTie on your shirt-collar, fasten your girdle, rub your breeches, clean\r\nyour shoes, wipe your nose on a napkin, pare your nails, clean your\r\nears, wash your teeth.\r\nHave your torn clothes mended, or new ones obtained.\r\nGet your satchell and books, and haste to School, taking too pen, paper,\r\nand ink, which are necessary for use at school.\r\nThen start off.\r\n\r\n_How to behave going to, and at, School._\r\nTake off your cap to those you meet; give way to passers by.\r\nCall your playmates on your road.\r\nAt School salute your master, and the scholars.\r\nGo straight to your place, undo your satchell, take out your books and\r\nlearn your lesson; stick well to your books.\r\nIf you don’t work, you’ll repent it when you grow up.\r\nWho could now speak of famous deeds of old, had not Letters preserved\r\nthem?\r\nWork hard then, and you’ll be thought worthy to serve the state.\r\nMen of low birth win honour by Learning, and then are doubly happy.\r\nWhen you doubt, ask to be told.\r\nWish well to those who warn you.\r\nOn your way home walk two and two orderly (for which men will praise\r\nyou); don’t run in heaps like a swarm of bees like boys do now.\r\nDon’t whoop or hallow as in fox-hunting don’t chatter, or stare at every\r\nnew fangle, but walk soberly, taking your cap off to all, and being\r\ngentle.\r\nDo no man harm; speak fair words.\r\nOn reaching home salute your parents reverently.\r\n\r\n_How to wait at table._\r\nLook your parents in the face, hold up your hands, and say\r\nGrace before meate.\r\nGrace before Meat.\r\nMake a low curtesy; wish your parents’ food may do ’em good.\r\nIf you are big enough, bring the food to table.\r\nDon’t fill dishes so full as to spill them on your parents’ dress, or\r\nthey’ll be angry.\r\nHave spare trenchers ready for guests.\r\nSee there’s plenty of everything wanted.\r\nEmpty the Voiders often.\r\nBe at hand if any one calls.\r\nWhen the meat is over, clear the table:\r\n  1. cover the salt,\r\n  2. have a tray by you to carry things off on,\r\n  3. put the trenchers, &c., in one Voider,\r\n  4. sweep the crumbs into another,\r\n  5. set a clean trencher before every one,\r\n  6. put on Cheese, Fruit, Biscuits, and\r\n  7. serve Wine, Ale or Beer.\r\nWhen these are finished, clear the table, and fold up the cloth.\r\nThen spread a clean towel, bring bason and jug, and when your parents\r\nare ready to wash, and when your parents are ready to wash, pour out the\r\nwater.\r\nClear the table; make a low curtsey.\r\n\r\n_How to behave at your own dinner._\r\nLet your betters sit above you.\r\nSee others served first, then wait a while before eating.\r\nTake salt with your knife, cut your bread, don’t fill your spoon too\r\nfull, or sup your pottage.\r\nHave your knife sharp.\r\nDon’t smack your lips or gnaw your bones: avoid such beastliness.\r\nKeep your fingers clean, wipe your mouth before drinking.\r\nDon’t jabber or stuff.\r\nSilence hurts no one, and is fitted for a child at table.\r\nDon’t pick your teeth, or spit too much.\r\nBehave properly.\r\nDon’t laugh too much.\r\nLearn all the good manners you can.\r\nThey are better than playing the fiddle, though that’s no harm, but\r\nnecessary; yet manners are more important.\r\n\r\n_How to behave at Church._\r\nPray kneeling or standing.\r\nConfess your sins to God.\r\nHe knows your disease.\r\nAsk in faith, and what you ask you shall have; He is more merciful than\r\npen can tell.\r\nBehave nicely in church, and don’t talk or chatter.\r\nBehave reverently; the House of Prayer is not to be made a fair.\r\nAvoid dicing and carding.\r\nDelight in Knowledge, Virtue, and Learning.\r\nHappy is he who cultivates Virtue.\r\nCursed is he who forsakes it.\r\nLet reason rule you, and subdue your lusts.\r\nThese ills come from gambling: strife, murder, theft, cursing and\r\nswearing.\r\n\r\n_How to behave when conversing._\r\nUnderstand a question before you answer it; let a man tell all his tale.\r\nThen bow to him, look him in the face, and answer sensibly, not staring\r\nabout or laughing, but audibly and distinctly, your words in due order,\r\nor you’ll straggle off, or stutter, or stammer, which is a foul crime.\r\nAlways keep your head uncovered.\r\nBetter unfed than untaught.\r\n\r\n_How to take a Message._\r\nListen to it well; don’t go away not knowing it.\r\nThen hurry away, give the message; get the answer, return home, and tell\r\nit to your master exactly as it was told to you.\r\n\r\n_Against Anger, &c._\r\nThe slave of Anger must fall.\r\nAnger’s deeds are strange to wise men.\r\nA hasty man is always in trouble.\r\nTake no revenge, but forgive.\r\nEnvy no one.\r\nAn ill body breeds debate.\r\n\r\n_The Fruits of Charity, &c._\r\nCharity seeketh not her own, but bears patiently.\r\nCharity seeketh not her own, but bears patiently.\r\nLove incites to Mercy.\r\nPatience teaches forbearance.\r\nPray God to give thee Charity and Patience, to lead thee to Virtue’s\r\nSchool, and thence to Eternal Bliss.\r\n\r\n_Against Swearing._\r\nTake not God’s name in vain, or He will plague thee.\r\nBeware of His wrath, and live well in thy vocation.\r\nWhat is the good of swearing?\r\nIt kindles God’s wrath against thee.\r\nGod’s law forbids swearing, and so does the counsel of Philosophers.\r\n\r\n_Against filthy talking._\r\nNever talk dirt.\r\nFor every word we shall give account at the Day of Doom, and be judged\r\naccording to our deeds.\r\nLet lewd livers then fear.\r\nKeep your tongue from vain talking.\r\n\r\n_Against Lying._\r\nTo speak the truth needs no study, therefore always practise it and\r\nspeak it.\r\nShame is the reward of lying.\r\nAlways speak the truth.\r\nWho can trust a liar?\r\nIf a lie saves you once, it deceives you thrice.\r\n\r\n_A bedward Prayer._\r\nGod of mercy, take us into Thy care.\r\nForgive us our sins.\r\nDeliver us from evil, and our enemy the Devil.\r\nAssist us to conquer him and ascribe all honour to Thee.\r\n\r\n_Each one’s Duty._\r\nThe Duty of Princes, Judges, Prelates, Parents, Children, Masters,\r\nServants, Husbands.\r\nThe Duty of Wives, Parsons and Vicars, Men of Law, Craftsmen, Landlords,\r\nMerchants, Subjects, Rich Men, Poor Men, Magistrates, Officers,\r\nThe Duty of all Men.\r\nGod grant us all to live and die well!\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhate-ever thow sey, avyse thee welle: Sidenotes\r\n\r\nA man must mind what he says; hearts are fickle and fell.\r\nTake care what you say. A false friend may hear it, and after a year or\r\ntwo will repeat it.\r\nHasty speech hurts hearer and speaker. In the beginning, think on the\r\nend.\r\nYou tell a man a secret, and he’ll betray it for a drink of wine. Mind\r\nwhat you say.\r\nAvoid backbiting and flattering; refrain from malice, and bragging.\r\nA venomous tongue causes sorrow. When words are said, regret is too\r\nlate.\r\nMind what you say.\r\nHad men thought of this, many things done in England would never have\r\nbeen begun.\r\nTo speak aright observe six things:\r\n  1. what; 2. of whom; 3. where; 4. to whom; 5. why; 6. when.\r\nIn every place mind what you say.\r\nAlmighty God, grant me grace to serve Thee!\r\nMary, mother, send me grace night and day!\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Dogg Lardyner, & a Sowe Gardyner: Sidenotes\r\n\r\nA dog in a larder, a sow in a garden, a fool with wise men, are ill\r\nmatcht.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRoger Ascham’s Advice to Lord Warwick’s Servant: Sidenotes\r\n\r\nFear God, serve your lord faithfully, be courteous to your fellows.\r\nDespise no poor man.\r\nCarry no tales.\r\nTell no lies.\r\nDon’t play at dice or cards.\r\nTake to your lord’s favourite sport.\r\nBeware of idleness.\r\nAlways be at hand when you’re wanted.\r\nDiligence will get you praise.\r\nGod be with you!\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Babees Book: Sidenotes\r\n\r\nMy God, support me while I translate this treatise from Latin.

do not chatter or let your eyes wander about the house.\r\nAnswer sensibly, shortly, and easily.\r\nMany words are a bore to a wise man.\r\nStand till you are told to sit: keep your head, hands, and feet quiet:\r\ndon’t scratch yourself, or lean against a post, or handle anything near.\r\nBow to your lord when you answer.\r\nIf any one better than yourself comes in, retire and give place to him.\r\nTurn your back on no man.\r\nBe silent while your lord drinks, not laughing, whispering, or joking.\r\nIf he tells you to sit down, do so at once.\r\nThen don’t talk dirt, or scorn any one, but be meek and cheerful.\r\nIf your better praises you, rise up and thank him heartily.\r\nWhen your lord or lady is speaking about the household, don’t you\r\ninterfere, but be always ready to serve at the proper time,\r\nto bring drink, hold lights, or anything else, and so get a good name.\r\nThe best prayer you can make to God is to be well mannered.\r\nIf your lord offers you his cup, rise up, take it with both hands, offer\r\nit to no one else, but give it back to him that brought it.\r\nAt Noon, when your lord is ready for dinner, some pour water on him,\r\nsome hold the towel for him till he has finished, and don’t leave till\r\ngrace is said.\r\nStand by your lord till he tells you to sit, then keep your knife clean\r\nand sharp to cut your food.\r\nBe silent, and tell no nasty stories.\r\nCut your bread, don’t break it.\r\nLay a clean trencher before you, and eat your broth with a spoon, don’t\r\nsup it up.\r\nDon’t leave your spoon in your dish.\r\nDon’t lean on the table, or dirty the cloth.\r\nDon’t hang your head over your dish, or eat with a full mouth, or pick\r\nyour nose, teeth, and nails, or stuff your mouth so that you can’t\r\nspeak.\r\nWipe your mouth when you drink, and don’t dirty the cup with your hands.\r\nDon’t dip your meat in the salt-cellar,\r\nor put your knife in your mouth.\r\nTaste every dish that’s brought to you, and when once your plate is\r\ntaken away, don’t ask for it again.\r\nIf strangers dine with you, share all good food sent to you with them.\r\nIt’s not polite to keep it all to yourself.\r\nDon’t cut your meat like field labourers, who have such an appetite they\r\ndon’t care how they hack their food.\r\nSweet children, let your delight be courtesy, and eschew rudeness.\r\nHave a clean trencher and knife for your cheese, and eat properly.\r\nDon’t chatter either, and you shall get a good repute for gentleness.\r\nWhen the meal is over, clean your knives, and put them in their places;\r\nkeep your seats till you’ve washed; then rise up without laughing or\r\njoking, and go to your lord’s table.\r\nStand there till grace is said.\r\nThen some of you go for water, some hold the towel, some pour water over\r\nhis hands.\r\nOther things I shall not put in this little Report,\r\nbut skip over, praying that no one will abuse me for this work.\r\nLet readers add or take away: I address it to every one who likes to\r\ncorrect it.\r\nSweet children, I beseech you know this book, and may God make you so\r\nexpert therein that you may attain endless bliss.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLerne or be Lewde: Sidenotes\r\n\r\nDon’t be too loving or angry, bold or busy, courteous or cruel or\r\ncowardly, and don’t drink too often, or be too lofty or anxious, but\r\nfriendly of cheer.\r\nHate jealousy, be not too hasty or daring; joke not too oft; ware\r\nknaves’ tricks.\r\nDon’t be too grudging or too liberal, too meddling, too particular,\r\nnew-fangled, or too daring.\r\nHate oaths and flattery.\r\nPlease well thy master.\r\nDon’t be too rackety, or go out too much.\r\nDon’t be too revengeful or wrathful, and wade not too deep.\r\nThe middle path is the best for us all.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUrbanitatis: Sidenotes\r\n\r\nWhen you come before a lord take off your cap or hood, and fall on your\r\nright knee twice or thrice.\r\nKeep your cap off till you’re told to put it on; hold up your chin; look\r\nin the lord’s face; keep hand and foot still; don’t spit or snot; get\r\nrid of it quietly; behave well.\r\nWhen you go into the hall, don’t press up too high.\r\nDon’t be shamefaced.\r\nWherever you go, good manners make the man.\r\nReverence your betters, but treat all equally whom you don’t know.\r\nSee that your hands are clean, and your knife sharp.\r\nLet worthier men help themselves before you eat.\r\nDon’t clutch at the best bit.\r\nKeep your hands from dirtying the cloth, and don’t wipe your nose on it,\r\nor dip too deep in your cup.\r\nHave no meat in your mouth when you drink or speak; and stop talking\r\nwhen your neighbour is drinking.\r\nScorn and reprove no man.\r\nKeep your fingers from what would bring you to grief.\r\nAmong ladies, look, don’t talk.\r\nDon’t laugh loud, or riot with ribalds.\r\nDon’t repeat what you hear.\r\nWords make or mar you.\r\nIf you follow a worthier man, let your right shoulder follow his back,\r\nand don’t speak till he has done.\r\nBe austere (?) in speech; don’t stop any man’s tale.\r\nChrist gives us all wit to know this, and heaven as our reward.\r\nAmen!\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke or Edyllys be: Sidenotes\r\n\r\nClerks say that courtesy came from heaven when Gabriel greeted our Lady.\r\nAll virtues are included in it.\r\nSee that your hands and nails are clean.\r\nDon’t eat till grace is said, or sit down till you’re told.\r\nFirst, think on the poor;
