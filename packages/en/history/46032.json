EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nA biography of the great Bering is of especial interest to American\r\nreaders desiring an accurate history of a country that has recently\r\ncome into our possession, and the adjoining regions where most of\r\nthe geographical investigations of the intrepid Danish-Russian\r\nexplorer were made. The thorough, concise, and patient work done by\r\nMr. Lauridsen is deserving of world-wide commendation, while the\r\ntranslation into the language of our land by Professor Olson of the\r\nUniversity of Wisconsin puts students of American historical geography\r\nunder a debt for this labor of love rather than remuneration that\r\ncannot be easily paid, and which is not common in our country. It is a\r\nmatter of no small national pride that the translation into the English\r\nlanguage of a work so near American geographical interests should have\r\nbeen done by an American, rather than emanate from the Hakluyt Society\r\nor other British sources, from which we usually derive such valuable\r\ntranslations and compilations of old explorations and the doings of the\r\nfirst explorers.\r\n\r\nThe general American opinion regarding Bering is probably somewhat\r\ndifferent from that on the continent which gave him birth and a patron\r\ngovernment to carry out his gigantic and immortal plans; or, better\r\nspeaking, it was different during the controversy in the past over the\r\nvalue and authenticity of the great explorer's works, for European\r\nopinion of Bering has slowly been more and more favorable to him, until\r\nit has reached the maximum and complete vindication in the admirable\r\nlabors of Lauridsen, whose painstaking researches in the only archives\r\nwhere authentic data of the doings of the daring Dane could be found,\r\nhas left no ground for those critics to stand upon, who have censured\r\nPeter the Great's selection of an oriental explorer. In short, America\r\nhas always respected Bering as a great explorer, and oftentimes\r\nheralded him as one of the highest of heroes, whatever may have been\r\nthe varying phases of European thought on the subject; and the reasons\r\ntherefor, I think, are two-fold. In the first place, the continent\r\nwhich Bering first separated from the old world is yet a new country.\r\nSince its discovery, not only exploration, but commercial exploration,\r\nor pioneering as we call it, has been going on, and in this every one\r\nhas taken his part or mingled often with those who have. Presidents who\r\nwere pioneers, have been contemporaries with our times, while those who\r\nhave struggled on the selvage of civilization are numerous among us,\r\nand their adventures as narrated in books are familiar stories to our\r\nears. Such a people, I believe, am much less liable to listen to the\r\nlabored logic of a critic against a man who carried his expedition six\r\nthousand miles across a wilderness and launched it on the inhospitable\r\nshores of an unknown sea, to solve a problem that has borne them fruit,\r\nthan others not similarly situated would be. While the invariable rule\r\nhas been that where the path-finder and critic--unless the critic\r\nhas been an explorer in the same field--have come in collision, the\r\nlatter has always gone to the wall, it is easy to see that with a jury\r\nthat have themselves lived amidst similar, though possibly slighter,\r\nfrontier fortunes, such a verdict is more readily reached.\r\n\r\nThe other reason, which is not so commendable, is that few Americans\r\nat large have interested themselves in the discussion, or in fact knew\r\nmuch about it. True, the criticisms on the Eastern continent have been\r\nre-echoed on this side of the water, and even added to, but, they have\r\ncreated no general impression worth recording as such in a book that\r\nwill undoubtedly have far wider circulation than the discussion has\r\never had, unless I have misjudged the temper of the American people to\r\ndesire information on just such work as Bering has done, and which for\r\nthe first time is presented to them in anything like an authentic way\r\nby Professor Olson's translation of Mr. Lauridsen's work. I do not wish\r\nto be understood that we as a nation have been wholly indifferent to\r\nBering and the discussion of his claims. Far from it. It has rather\r\nbeen that in invading the Bering world their disposition has led them\r\nto view the solid ground on which he made his mark, rather than the\r\nclouds hovering above, and which this work dissipates. It is rather of\r\nthat character of ignorance--if so strong a word is justifiable--that\r\nis found here in the persistent misspelling of the great explorer's\r\nname and the bodies of water which have transmitted it to posterity\r\nso well, although the authority--really the absolute demand, if\r\ncorrectness is desired--for the change from _Behring_ to _Bering_ has\r\nbeen well known to exist for a number of years, and is now adopted in\r\neven our best elementary geographies. While the animalish axiom that\r\n\"ignorance is bliss\" is probably never true, there may be cases where\r\nit is apparently fortunate, and this may be so in that Americans in\r\nbeing seemingly apathetic have really escaped a discussion which after\r\nall has ended in placing the man considered in about the same _status_\r\nthat they always assumed he had filled. One might argue that it would\r\nhave been better for Americans, therefore, if they had been presented\r\nwith a simple and authentic biography of the immortal Danish-Russian,\r\nrather than with a book that is both a biography and a defense, but\r\nLauridsen's work after all is the best, I think all will agree, as no\r\nbiography of Bering could be complete without some account of that part\r\nin which he had no making and no share, as well as that better part\r\nwhich he chronicled with his own brain and brawn.\r\n\r\nI doubt yet if Americans will take very much interest in the dispute\r\nover Bering's simple claims in which he could take no part; but that\r\nthis book, which settles them so clearly, will be welcomed by the\r\nreading classes of a nation that by acquisition in Alaska has brought\r\nthem so near the field of the labor of Bering, I think there need not\r\nbe the slightest fear. It is one of the most important links yet welded\r\nby the wisdom of man which can be made into a chain of history for our\r\nnew acquisition whose history is yet so imperfect, and will remain so,\r\nuntil Russian archives are placed in the hands of those they consider\r\nfair-minded judges, as in the present work.\r\n\r\nOn still broader grounds, it is to be hoped that this work will meet\r\nwith American success, that it may be an entering wedge to that\r\nvaluable literature of geographical research and exploration, which\r\nfrom incompatibility of language and other causes has never been fully\r\nor even comprehensively opened to English speaking people. It has been\r\nwell said by one who has opportunities to fairly judge that \"it has\r\nbeen known by scientists for some time that more valuable investigation\r\nwas buried from sight in the Russian language than in any or all\r\nothers. Few can imagine what activity in geographical, statistical,\r\nastronomical, and other research has gone on in the empire of the\r\nCzar. It is predicted that within ten years more students will take up\r\nthe Russian language than those of other nations of Eastern Europe,\r\nsimply as a necessity. This youngest family of the Aryans is moving\r\nwestward with its ideas and literature, as well as its population\r\nand empire. There are no better explorers and no better recorders of\r\ninvestigations.\" It is undoubtedly a field in which Americans can reap\r\na rich reward of geographical investigation. There is an idea among\r\nsome, and even friends of Russia, that their travelers and explorers\r\nhave not done themselves justice in recording their doings, but this\r\nin the broad sense is not true. Rather they have been poor chroniclers\r\nfor the public; but their official reports, hidden away in government\r\narchives, are rich in their thorough investigations, oftentimes more\r\nnearly perfect and complete than the equivalents in our own language,\r\nwhere it takes no long argument to prove that great attention given to\r\nthe public and popular account, has been at the expense of the similar\r\nqualities in the official report; while many expeditions, American\r\nand British, have not been under official patronage at all, which has\r\nseldom been the case with Russian research. As already noted, the bulk\r\nof similar volumes from other languages and other archives into the\r\nEnglish has come from Great Britain; but probably from the unfortunate\r\nbitter antagonism between the two countries which has created an apathy\r\nin one and a suspicion in the other that they will not be judged in\r\nan unprejudiced way, Russia has not got a fair share of what she has\r\nreally accomplished geographically translated into our tongue. It is\r\nthrough America, an unprejudiced nation, that this could be remedied,\r\nif a proper interest is shown, and which will probably be determined,\r\nin a greater or less degree, by the reception of this book here,\r\nalthough it comes to us in the roundabout way of the Danish language.\r\n\r\n                                           FREDERICK SCHWATKA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn placing before the American public this book on Vitus Bering, I\r\ndesire to express my cordial thanks to those who by word and deed have\r\nassisted me. I am especially grateful to Lieutenant Frederick Schwatka,\r\nwho, in the midst of pressing literary labors consequent on his recent\r\nexplorations among the cave and cliff dwellers of the Sierra Madre\r\nMountains, has been so exceedingly kind as to write an introduction\r\nto the American edition of this work. I feel confident that the\r\nintroductory words of this doughty explorer will secure for Bering that\r\nconsideration from the American people to which he is fairly entitled.\r\n\r\nI find it a pleasant day to acknowledge my indebtedness to Dr. Leonhard\r\nStejneger of the Smithsonian Institution, who has sent me some valuable\r\nand interesting notes to the chapter on \"The Stay on Bering Island\"\r\n(Chapter XIX). Dr. Stejneger's notes are of especial interest, for in\r\nthe years 1882-'84 he spent eighteen months on Bering Island in the\r\nservice of the United States government, the object of his expedition\r\nbeing to study the general natural history of the island, to collect\r\nspecimens of all kinds, but especially to search for remains of the\r\nsea-cow. He wished also to identify the places mentioned by Steller,\r\nthe famous naturalist of the Bering expedition, in order to compare\r\nhis description with the localities as they present themselves to-day,\r\nand to visit the places where Bering's vessel was wrecked, where the\r\nill-fated expedition wintered, and where Steller made his observations\r\non the sea-cow. The results of Dr. Stejneger's investigations have been\r\npublished in \"Proceedings of the United States National Museum\" and in\r\nvarious American and European scientific journals.\r\n\r\nI am also under obligation to Prof. Rasmus B. Anderson, Ex-United\r\nStates Minister to Denmark, through whom I have been enabled to make\r\nthis an authorized edition, and to Reuben G. Thwaites, Secretary of the\r\nWisconsin State Historical Society, and Frederick J. Turner, Assistant\r\nProfessor of American History in the University of Wisconsin, for\r\nvaluable criticism and suggestions.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the orthography of Russian and Siberian names, I wish\r\nto say that I have endeavored to follow American writers that\r\nadvocate a rational simplification. W. H. Dall, author of \"Alaska\r\nand its Resources,\" says on this point: \"From ignorance of the true\r\nphonetic value of the Russian compound consonants, and from literal\r\ntranscription, instead of phonetic translation, of the German rendering\r\nof Russian and native names, much confusion has arisen. Many writers\r\npersistently represent the third letter of the Russian alphabet by _w_,\r\nwriting Romanow instead of Romanoff, etc. The twenty-fifth letter is\r\nalso frequently rendered _tsch_ instead of _ch_ soft, as in church,\r\nwhich fully represents it in English. It is as gross an error to spell\r\n_Kamchatka_ for instance, _Kamtschatka_, as it would be for a foreigner\r\nto represent the English word _church_ by _tschurtsch_, and so on.\"\r\nFrom this it would seem that the Germanized forms of these names are\r\nincorrect, as well as needlessly forbidding in appearance. It is,\r\nmoreover, due to German writers that Bering's name has been burdened\r\nwith a superfluous letter. Facsimiles of his autograph, one of which\r\nmay be seen by referring to Map I. in the Appendix, prove incontestably\r\nthat he spelled his name without an _h_.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Lauridsen's book is essentially a defense of Vitus Bering,\r\nwritten especially for the student of history and historical geography,\r\nit nevertheless contains several chapters of thrilling interest to the\r\ngeneral reader. The closing chapters, for instance, give, not only a\r\nreliable account of the results of Bering's voyage of discovery in\r\nthe North Pacific, and valuable scientific information concerning the\r\nremarkable animal life on Bering Island, where, before Bering's frail\r\nship was dashed upon its shores, no human foot had trod, but they also\r\nportray in vivid colors the tragic events that brought this greatest of\r\ngeographical enterprises to a close.\r\n\r\nThe regions to which Bering's last labors gave Russia the first title\r\nare at the present time the object of much newspaper comment. His last\r\nexpedition, the few survivors of which brought home costly skins that\r\nevinced the great wealth of the newly discovered lands, opened up to\r\nthe Russian fur-hunter an El Dorado that still continues to be a most\r\nprofitable field of pursuit, now vigilantly watched by the jealous eyes\r\nof rival nations.\r\n\r\n                                              JULIUS E. OLSON.\r\n\r\nMADISON, WIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR'S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the patronage of the Hielmstierne-Rosencrone Institution,\r\nobtained in the summer of 1883, I was enabled to spend some time\r\namong the archives and libraries in St. Petersburg, to prepare myself\r\nfor undertaking this work on Vitus Bering. I very soon, however,\r\nencountered obstacles which unassisted I should not have been able\r\nto surmount; for, contrary to my expectations, all the original\r\nmanuscripts and archives pertaining to the history of Bering were\r\nwritten in Russian, and the latter in such difficult language that none\r\nbut native palæographers could read them.\r\n\r\nI should for this reason have been compelled to return without having\r\naccomplished anything, had I not in two gentlemen, Admiral Th. Wessalgo\r\nand Mr. August Thornam of the telegraph department, found all the\r\nassistance that I needed. The Admiral is director of the department\r\nof hydrography, and has charge of the magnificent archives of the\r\nAdmiralty. He is very familiar with the history of the Russian fleet,\r\nand he gave me, not only excellent and exhaustive bibliographical\r\ninformation, besides putting at my disposal the library of the\r\ndepartment, but also had made for me copies of various things that were\r\nnot easily accessible. He has, moreover, since my return been unwearied\r\nin furnishing me such information from the Russian archives as I have\r\ndesired. For all of this kindness, enhanced by the Admiral's flattering\r\nremarks about Denmark and the Danes, I find it a pleasant duty to\r\nexpress my warmest thanks. To Mr. Thornam I am no less indebted.\r\nNotwithstanding his laborious duties in the central telegraph office of\r\nSt. Petersburg, he found it possible week after week, often eight or\r\nten hours out of the twenty-four, to assist me in translating the vast\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nBesides this, I derived much benefit from his comprehensive knowledge\r\nof Siberia, obtained on travels in the same regions where Bering had\r\nbeen. He has had the kindness to examine the collection of charts and\r\nmaps in both the Admiralty and Imperial libraries, and secure for me\r\nsome valuable copies. He has also, at my request, examined a series of\r\narticles in periodicals containing notices of Bering's geographical\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nIt is only by means of this valuable assistance that I have succeeded\r\nin basing this biographical sketch on Russian literature, and putting\r\nit, as I hope, on a par with what has been written on this subject by\r\nRussian authors.\r\n\r\nOf the many others that in one way or another have seconded\r\nmy efforts in giving as valuable a biography of my renowned\r\nfellow-countryman as possible, I owe special thanks--not to mention\r\nthe Hielmstierne-Rosencrone Institution--to Mr. Hegel, the veteran\r\npublisher, Col. Hoskier, Dr. Karl Verner, instructor in Sclavonic\r\nlanguages at the University of Copenhagen, who has examined some very\r\ndifficult archival matter for me, Professor Alexander Vasilievich\r\nGrigorieff, Secretary of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society,\r\nand to Mr. E. W. Dahlgren, Secretary of the Swedish Society for\r\nAnthropology and Geography. P. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nBERING'S FIRST EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  RUSSIA AND ENGLAND IN THE WORK OF ARCTIC EXPLORATION.--VITUS BERING'S\r\n    RANK AS AN EXPLORER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the great work of Arctic exploration done during the last two\r\ncenturies, it was first Russia and later England that took the lead,\r\nand to these two nations we are principally indebted for our knowledge\r\nof Arctic continental coast-lines. The English expeditions were\r\nundertaken with better support, and under circumstances better designed\r\nto attract public attention. They have, moreover, been excellently\r\ndescribed, and are consequently well known. But in the greatness\r\nof the tasks undertaken, in the perseverance of their leaders, in\r\ndifficulties, dangers, and tragic fates, Russian explorations stand\r\nworthily at their side. The geographical position of the Russians,\r\ntheir dispersion throughout the coldest regions of the earth, their\r\nfrugal habits, remarkable power of foresight, and their adventurous\r\nspirit, make them especially fitted for Arctic explorations. Hence, as\r\nearly as the first half of the eighteenth century, they accomplished\r\nfor Asia what the English not until a hundred years later succeeded in\r\ndoing for the other side of the earth,--namely, the charting of the\r\npolar coasts.\r\n\r\nIn this work the Russians introduced the system of coasting and\r\nsledging into the service of Arctic expeditions, and it is only\r\nthrough a systematic development of these means that western Europe has\r\nbeen enabled to celebrate its most brilliant triumphs in the Arctic\r\nregions, and to succeed in getting farther than did the navigators of\r\nthe seventeenth century. The history of Russian polar explorations has\r\na series of proud names, which lack only the pen of a Sherard Osborn\r\nto shine by the side of Franklin and McClure, and it redounds to the\r\nhonor of Denmark that one of the first and greatest of these men was\r\na Dane,--that the most brilliant chapter in the history of Russian\r\nexplorations is due to the initiative and indefatigable energy of Vitus\r\nBering. In the service of Peter the Great he successfully doubled the\r\nnortheastern peninsula of Asia, and after his return he made a plan for\r\nthe exploration of the whole Northeast passage from the White Sea to\r\nJapan. Although he succumbed in this undertaking, he lived long enough\r\nto see his gigantic plans approach realization.\r\n\r\nBering was buried on an island in the Pacific, amid the scenes of his\r\nlabors, under that sand-barrow which had been his death-bed. For many\r\ngenerations only a plain wooden cross marked his resting-place, and\r\nas for his fame, it has been as humble and modest as his head-board.\r\nHis labors belonged to a strange people who had but little sympathy\r\nfor the man. His own countrymen, among whom he might have found this\r\nsympathetic interest, knew his work but very imperfectly. Not until\r\nafter the lapse of a century did he find a careful biographer, and even\r\nwithin comparatively recent years the great scientist Von Baer has\r\nfound it necessary to defend him against misunderstandings and petty\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\nDanish literature contains nothing of moment concerning him, for the\r\ntwo treatises which several generations ago were published by M.\r\nHallager and Odin Wolff, are merely scanty extracts from G. F. Müller's\r\nhistorical works. In the following pages, therefore, relying not only\r\nupon Russian, but also upon West European literature for information,\r\nwe desire to erect to him a monument by giving a short account of his\r\nlife and work, sketching at the same time a chapter of geographical\r\nhistory which is lacking neither in importance nor in interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  BERING'S NATIVITY.--NORWEGIANS AND DANES IN THE SERVICE OF PETER THE\r\n    GREAT.--FOUNDING OF THE RUSSIAN NAVY.\r\n\r\n\r\nVitus Bering was a son of Jonas Svendsen and his second wife, Anna\r\nBering of Horsens, at which place he was born in the summer of 1681. On\r\nthe maternal side he descended from the distinguished Bering family,\r\nwhich during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries flourished in\r\nvarious parts of Denmark, and included a very respectable number of\r\nministers and judicial officers.[1]\r\n\r\nOur hero passed his childhood in a Christian family of culture in the\r\nJutland seaport town of his birth. Here for a series of years his\r\nfather filled several positions of trust, and was closely associated\r\nwith the leading men of the place, as his wife's sister, Margaret\r\nBering, had married two consecutive mayors. He was, however, far from\r\nbeing considered well-to-do. He had many children. One of his sons\r\nhad caused him much trouble and expense, and was finally sent to the\r\nEast Indies. In the probate record of his estate, made in 1719, there\r\nis a deed of conveyance from himself and wife in which the following\r\nappears: \"We are old, miserable, and decrepit people, in no way able\r\nto help ourselves. Our property consists of the old dilapidated home\r\nand the furniture thereto belonging, which is of but little value.\" It\r\nwas his share of this inheritance, with accrued interest, all amounting\r\nto 140 _rigsdaler_, that Vitus Bering later presented to his native\r\ntown to be used for the benefit of the poor.\r\n\r\nFrom inclination, and forced by the circumstances of his humble home,\r\nBering went to sea, and on the long expeditions that he made, he\r\ndeveloped into an able seaman. From an East India expedition in 1703 he\r\ncame to Amsterdam, where he made the acquaintance of Admiral Cruys, a\r\nnative of Norway. Soon afterwards, at the age of twenty-two, he joined\r\na Russian fleet as a sub-lieutenant. What Norwegian and Danish seamen\r\naccomplished at this period in the service of Russia, has been almost\r\nentirely forgotten. In the company of intelligent foreigners that Czar\r\nPeter employed for the transformation of his kingdom, the Danish-Norse\r\ncontingent occupies a prominent place. This is due principally to\r\nPeter himself, and was a result of his experiences in Holland. After\r\nhaving, on his first extensive foreign trip, learned the art of\r\nship-building,--not in Zaandam, as it is usually stated, but at the\r\ndocks of the East India Company in Amsterdam,--he was much dissatisfied\r\nwith the empirical method which the Hollanders used, and he wrote to\r\nVoronetz, his own ship-yard, that the Dutch ship-builders there should\r\nno longer be permitted to work independently, but be placed under the\r\nsupervision of Danes or Englishmen.\r\n\r\nPeter retained his high regard for Danish-Norse ship-building during\r\nhis whole life, and it was on this account that Danes and Norwegians\r\nwere enabled to exert so great an influence in St. Petersburg. This is\r\nthe reason, too, that Danish-Norse[2] seamen were received so kindly in\r\nRussia even long after the death of the great Czar.\r\n\r\nNext to Peter, Norwegians and Danes had the greatest share in the\r\nfounding of the Russian fleet, and among them the place of honor\r\nbelongs to the Norseman Cornelius Cruys, who in 1697 was assistant\r\nmaster of ordnance in the Dutch navy, where he was held in high\r\nregard as a ship-builder, a cartographer, and as a man well versed in\r\neverything pertaining to the equipment of a fleet. Peter made him his\r\nvice-admiral, and assigned to him the technical control of the fleet,\r\nthe building of new vessels, their equipment, and, above all, the task\r\nof supplying them with West European officers.\r\n\r\nWeber assigns Cruys a place in the first rank among those foreigners to\r\nwhom Russia owes much of her development, and remarks that it was he,\r\n\"the incomparable master of ordnance, who put the Russian fleet upon\r\nits keel and upon the sea.\" He belonged to the fashionable circles of\r\nSt. Petersburg, owned a large and beautiful palace on the Neva, where\r\nnow tower the Winter Palace and the Hermitage, and was one of the few\r\namong the wealthy that enjoyed the privilege of entertaining the Czar\r\non festive occasions. He became vice-president of the council of the\r\nAdmiralty, was promoted, after the peace of Nystad, to the position of\r\nadmiral of the Blue Flag, and made a knight of the order of Alexander\r\nNevsky.\r\n\r\nIn Peter the Great's remarkable house in St. Petersburg there is\r\npreserved, among many other relics, a yawl which is called the\r\ngrandfather of the fleet. With this, Peter had begun his nautical\r\nexperiments, and in 1723, when he celebrated the founding of his fleet,\r\nhe rowed down the Neva in it. Peter himself was at the rudder, Apraxin\r\nwas cockswain, and Admiral Cruys, Vice-Admiral Gordon, Sievers and\r\nMenshikoff were at the oars. On this occasion the Czar embraced Cruys\r\nand called him his father.\r\n\r\nDuring his whole life Cruys preserved a warm affection for his native\r\nland; hence it was natural that the Scandinavian colony in St.\r\nPetersburg gathered about him. His successor as vice-president of the\r\ncouncil of the Admiralty, and as master of ordnance, was the former\r\nDanish naval lieutenant Peter Sievers, who likewise elevated himself\r\nto most important positions, and exerted a highly beneficial influence\r\nupon the development of the Russian fleet. At the side of these two\r\nheroes, moreover, there were others, as Admirals Daniel Wilster and\r\nPeter Bredal, Commander Thure Trane, and also Skeving, Herzenberg,\r\nPeder Grib, \"Tordenskjold's[3] brave comrade in arms,\" and many others.\r\n\r\nFor a long time Vitus Bering was one of Cruys's most intimate\r\nassociates, and these two, with Admiral Sievers, form an honorable trio\r\nin that foreign navy. Bering was soon appointed to a position in the\r\nBaltic fleet, and during Russia's protracted struggles, his energy\r\nfound that scope which he before had sought on the ocean, and at the\r\nsame time he had the satisfaction of fighting the foes of his native\r\nland. He was a bold and able commander. During the whole war he cruised\r\nabout in the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea, and in the Baltic and other\r\nnorthern waters. Some of the most important transport expeditions\r\nwere entrusted to him. The Czar prized his services very highly, and\r\nwhen, after the misfortune at Pruth in 1711, he laid a plan to rescue\r\nthree of the best ships of his Black Sea fleet by a bold run through\r\nthe Bosporus, Vitus Bering, Peder Bredal, and Simon Skop were chosen\r\nfor the task. Whether the plan was carried out, it is difficult to\r\ndetermine. Berch says that it was not, and adds, \"I cite the incident\r\nsimply to show that even at that time Bering was looked upon as an\r\nexcellent commander.\" In various West European authorities, however,\r\nit is distinctly stated that Sievers conducted the ships to England,\r\nand in a review of Bering's life published by the Admiralty in 1882, it\r\nis stated that Bering was in 1711 appointed to conduct the ship Munker\r\nfrom the Sea of Azov to the Baltic, and as the Admiralty would hardly\r\nin a condensed report have taken notice of plans which had never been\r\ncarried out, it seems most probable that Berch has been incorrectly\r\ninformed.\r\n\r\nIn 1707 Bering was promoted to the position of lieutenant, in 1710\r\nto that of lieutenant-captain, and in 1715 to that of captain of\r\nthe fourth rank, when he assumed command of the new ship Selafail\r\nin Archangel to sail it to Copenhagen and Kronstadt. In 1716 he\r\nparticipated in an expedition of the united fleets to Bornholm under\r\nthe command of Sievers. In 1717 he was made captain of the third, and\r\nin 1720 of the second rank, and took part, until peace was concluded,\r\nin the various manoeuvers in the Baltic under the command of Gordon and\r\nApraxin.[4]\r\n\r\nAfter the peace of Nystad in 1721, however, his position became\r\nsomewhat unpleasant. Although he was a brother-in-law of Vice-Admiral\r\nSaunders, he had, according to Berch, powerful enemies in the\r\nAdmiralty. The numerous promotions made after the conclusion of peace,\r\nin no way applied to him. In the following year younger comrades\r\nwere advanced beyond him, and hence in 1724 he demanded promotion to\r\na captaincy of the first rank, or his discharge. After protracted\r\nnegotiations, and in spite of the fact that Apraxin repeatedly refused\r\nto sign his discharge, he finally obtained it, and then withdrew to his\r\nhome in Viborg, Finland, where he owned an estate, and where, no doubt\r\non account of the Scandinavian character of the city, he preferred\r\nto stay. During the negotiations for his discharge, the Czar was in\r\nOlonetz, but some time afterwards he informed Apraxin that Bering was\r\nagain to enter the navy, and with the desired promotion. This occurred\r\nin August, 1724, and a few months later Bering was appointed chief of\r\nthe _First Kamchatkan Expedition_, the object of which was to determine\r\nwhether Asia and America were connected by land.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Some details of Bering's genealogy, which can be of no interest to\r\nthe American reader, the translator has taken the liberty to omit.\r\n\r\n[2] Norway and Denmark were at this time united.--TR.\r\n\r\n[3] Peter Tordenskjold (1691-1720), a Norwegian in the Danish Norse\r\nservice,--the greatest naval hero Scandinavia has ever produced.--TR.\r\n\r\n[4] See Appendix, Note 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  PLANS FOR BERING'S FIRST EXPEDITION.--PETER THE GREAT'S DESIRE TO\r\n    KNOW THE EXTENT OF HIS EMPIRE.--THE NORTHEAST PASSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe equipment of Bering's first expedition was one of Peter the Great's\r\nlast administrative acts. From his death-bed his energy set in motion\r\nthose forces which in the generation succeeding him were to conquer a\r\nnew world for human knowledge. It was not until his mighty spirit was\r\nabout to depart this world that the work was begun, but the impetus\r\ngiven by him was destined to be effective for half a century; and the\r\nresults achieved still excite our admiration.\r\n\r\nPeter was incited to undertake this work by a desire for booty, by a\r\nkeen, somewhat barbaric curiosity, and by a just desire to know the\r\nnatural boundaries of his dominion. He was no doubt less influenced\r\nby the flattery of the French Academy and other institutions than\r\nis generally supposed. His great enterprise suddenly brought Russia\r\ninto the front rank of those nations which at that time were doing\r\ngeographical exploration. Just before his death three great enterprises\r\nwere planned: the establishment of a mart at the mouth of the river Kur\r\nfor the oriental trade, the building up of a maritime trade with India,\r\nand an expedition to search for the boundary between Asia and America.\r\nThe first two projects did not survive the Czar, but Bering clung to\r\nthe plan proposed for him, and accomplished his task.\r\n\r\nPeter the Great gave no heed to obstacles, and never weighed the\r\npossibilities for the success of an enterprise. Consequently his\r\nplans were on a grand scale, but the means set aside for carrying\r\nthem out were often entirely inadequate, and sometimes even wholly\r\ninapplicable. His instructions were usually imperious and laconic.\r\nTo his commander-in-chief in Astrakhan he once wrote: \"When fifteen\r\nboats arrive from Kazan, you will sail them to Baku and sack the\r\ntown.\" His instructions to Bering are characteristic of his condensed\r\nand irregular style. They were written by himself, in December, 1724,\r\nfive weeks before his death, and are substantially as follows: \"I. At\r\nKamchatka or somewhere else two decked boats are to be built. II. With\r\nthese you are to sail northward along the coast, and as the end of the\r\ncoast is not known this land is undoubtedly America. III. For this\r\nreason you are to inquire where the American coast begins, and go to\r\nsome European colony; and when European ships are seen you are to ask\r\nwhat the coast is called, note it down, make a landing, obtain reliable\r\ninformation, and then, after having charted the coast, return.\"\r\n\r\nAfter West Europe for two centuries had wearied itself with the\r\nquestion of a Northeast passage and made strenuous efforts to navigate\r\nthe famed Strait of Anian, Russia undertook the task in a practical\r\nmanner and went in search of the strait, before it started out on a\r\nvoyage around the northern part of the old world.\r\n\r\nWere Asia and America connected, or was there a strait between the two\r\ncountries? Was there a Northwest and a Northeast passage? It was these\r\ngreat and interesting questions that were to be settled by Bering's\r\nfirst expedition. Peter himself had no faith in a strait. He had,\r\nhowever, no means of knowing anything about it, for at his death the\r\neast coast of Asia was known only as far as the island of Yezo. The\r\nPacific coast of America had been explored and charted no farther than\r\nCape Blanco, 43° north latitude, while all of the northern portion\r\nof the Pacific, its eastern and western coast-lines, its northern\r\ntermination, and its relation to the polar sea, still awaited its\r\ndiscoverer.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned ukase shows that the Czar's inquisitive mind was\r\ndwelling on the possibility of being able, through northeastern Asia,\r\nto open a way to the rich European colonies in Central America. He\r\nknew neither the enormous extent of the far East nor the vastness\r\nof the ocean that separated it from the Spanish colonies. Yet even\r\nat that time, various representatives of the great empire living in\r\nnortheastern Siberia had some knowledge of the relative situation of\r\nthe two continents and could have given Bering's expedition valuable\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nRumors of the proximity of the American continent to the northeastern\r\ncorner of Asia must very early have been transmitted through Siberia,\r\nfor the geographers of the sixteenth century have the relative position\r\nof the two continents approximately correct. Thus on the Barents map\r\nof 1598, republished by J. J. Pontanus in 1611, a large continent\r\ntowers above northeastern Asia with the superscription, \"America Pars,\"\r\nthe two countries being separated by the Strait of Anian[5] (Fretum\r\nAnian). On a map by Joducus Hondius, who died in 1611, East Siberia is\r\ndrawn as a parallelogram projecting toward the northeast, and directly\r\nopposite and quite near the northeast corner of this figure a country\r\nis represented with the same superscription. This is found again in the\r\nmap by Gerhard Mercator which accompanies Nicolai Witsen's \"_Noord en\r\nOst Tartarye_,\" 1705, and in several other sixteenth century atlases.\r\nIt is quite impossible to determine how much of this apparent knowledge\r\nis due to vague reports combined with happy guessing, and how much to a\r\npractical desire for such a passage on the part of European navigators,\r\nwhose expensive polar expeditions otherwise would be folly. This much\r\nis certain, however: Witsen and other leading geographers based their\r\nviews on information received from Siberia and Russia.[6]\r\n\r\nIn the history of discoveries the spirit of human enterprise has fought\r\nits way through an incalculable number of mirages. These have aroused\r\nthe imagination, caused agitations, debates, and discussions, but have\r\nusually veiled an earlier period's knowledge of the question. There\r\nare many re-discovered countries on our globe. So in this case. The\r\nnorthwestern part of America wholly disappeared from the cartography\r\nof the seventeenth century, and through the influence of Witsen's\r\nand Homann's later maps it became customary to represent the eastern\r\ncoast of Asia by a meridian passing a little east of Yakutsk, without\r\nany suggestions whatever in regard to its strongly marked peninsulas\r\nor to an adjacent western continent. But even these representations\r\nwere originally Russian, and are undoubtedly due to the first original\r\nRussian atlas, published by Remesoff. They finally gave way to the\r\ngeographical explorations of the eighteenth century, which began\r\nshortly after the accession of Peter the Great, having been provoked by\r\npolitical events and conditions.\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of Nertchinsk in 1689 the Yablonoi Mountains were\r\nestablished as the boundary line between Russia and China. By this\r\nmeans the way to the fertile lands of Amoor was barred to that indurate\r\ncaste of Russian hussars and Cossacks who had conquered for the\r\nWhite Czar the vast tracts of Siberia. A second time they fell upon\r\nnortheastern Siberia, pressing their way, as before, across uninhabited\r\ntundras along the northern ocean, and thence conquered the inhabited\r\ndistricts toward the south. They discovered the island of Liakhov,\r\npenetrated the country of the Chukchees, Koriaks, and Kamshadales,\r\nand at the Anadyr River, in Deshneff's old palisaded fort, they found\r\nthat point of support from which they maintained Russia's power in the\r\nextreme northeast. In this way the Russians learned the enormous extent\r\nof the country; but as they had no exact locations, they formed a very\r\nincorrect opinion of its outlines, and estimated its length from west\r\nto east too small by forty degrees.\r\n\r\nFrom the fort on the Anadyr, Kamchatka was conquered in the first years\r\nof the eighteenth century, and from here came the first information\r\nconcerning America. In 1711 the Cossack Popoff visited the Chukchee\r\npeninsula, and here he heard that from either side of the peninsula,\r\nboth from the \"Kolymaic\" Sea and the Gulf of Anadyr, an island could be\r\nseen in the distance, which the Chukchees called \"the great land.\" This\r\nland they said they could reach in _baidars_ (boats rowed by women) in\r\none day. Here were found large forests of pine, cedar, and other trees,\r\nand also many different kinds of animals not found in their country.\r\nThis reliable information concerning America seems at the time to have\r\nbeen known in other parts of Siberia only in the way of vague reports,\r\nand was soon confused with descriptions of islands in the Arctic.\r\n\r\nCzar Peter, however, soon laid his adjusting hand upon these groping\r\nefforts. By the aid of Swedish prisoners of war, he opened the\r\nnavigation from Okhotsk to Kamchatka, and thus avoided the circuitous\r\nroute by way of the Anadyr. A Cossack by the name of Ivan Kosyrefski\r\n(the son of a Polish officer in Russian captivity) was ordered to\r\nexplore the peninsula to its southern extremity, and also some of\r\nthe Kurile Islands. In 1719 he officially despatched the surveyors\r\nYevrinoff and Lushin to ascertain whether Asia and America were\r\nconnected, but secretly he instructed them to go to the Kurile\r\nIslands to search for precious metals, especially a white mineral\r\nwhich the Japanese were said to obtain in large quantities from the\r\nfifth or sixth island. Through these various expeditions there was\r\ncollected vast, although unscientific, materials for the more correct\r\nunderstanding of the geography of eastern Asia, the Sea of Okhotsk,\r\nKamchatka, the Kuriles, and Yezo. Even concerning the Island of\r\nNipon (Hondo), shipwrecked Japanese had given valuable information.\r\nSimultaneously, the northern coast about the mouth of the Kolyma, had\r\nbeen explored by the Cossacks Viligin and Amossoff. Through them the\r\nfirst information concerning the Bear Islands and Wrangell Island found\r\nits way to Yakutsk. The Cossack chief Shestakoff, who had traveled\r\ninto the northeastern regions toward the land of the Chukchees,\r\naccepted the accounts of the former for his map, but as he could\r\nneither read nor write, matters were most bewilderingly confused. Yet\r\nhis representations were later accepted by Strahlenberg and Joseph de\r\nl'Isle in their maps.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] In Baron A. E. Nordenskjöld's review of the Danish edition of this\r\nwork on Bering in the _Journal of the American Geographical Society_,\r\nVol. XVII., p. 290, he says: \"In Barents' map of 1598 there is not, as\r\nMr. Lauridsen seems to suppose, anything original as to the delineation\r\nof the northern coast of Asia and the relative situation of Asia and\r\nAmerica. In this respect Barents' map is only a reproduction of older\r\nmaps, which, with regard to the delineation of the northern coast of\r\nAsia, are based upon pre-Columbian suppositions; and these again rest\r\nupon the story told by Pliny the Elder in the 'Historia Naturalis,'\r\nL. VII., 13, 17, about the northern limit of the world known to him,\"\r\netc. The judicious reader can not fail to see that the renowned author\r\nhere shoots far beyond the mark, for Pliny the Elder can hardly be\r\nsupposed to have had any knowledge of \"America Pars.\"--_Author's Note\r\nto American Edition._\r\n\r\n[6] Note 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  BERING'S KNOWLEDGE OF SIBERIAN GEOGRAPHY.--TERRORS OF TRAVELING\r\n    IN SIBERIA.--THE EXPEDITION STARTS OUT.--THE JOURNEY FROM ST.\r\n    PETERSBURG TO THE PACIFIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now the question is, what did Bering know of these efforts which\r\nhad been made during the decades preceding his expedition, and which\r\nin spite of their unscientific character, were nevertheless of such\r\ngreat importance in order to be able to initiate one's self in the\r\ngeography of eastern Asia? In the first place, the surveyor Lushin,\r\nwas a member of the Bering expedition, and when Bering, in the summer\r\nof 1726, was sojourning in Yakutsk, Shestakoff's nephew, who had\r\naccompanied his uncle on his expedition against the Chukchees, became\r\nan attaché of Bering's expedition, while the elder Shestakoff had gone\r\nto Russia to collect means for the contemplated military expedition.\r\nFurthermore, Ivan Kosyrefski, who in the meantime had become a monk,\r\nwas also staying in Yakutsk, and his valuable report preserved in the\r\nvoivode's (governor's) office was now surrendered to Bering. Thus we\r\nsee that Bering was in personal contact with the men, who, in the\r\ndecade preceding, were the chief possessors of geographical knowledge\r\nconcerning those northeastern regions.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, he received in Yakutsk information concerning\r\nDeshneff's journey in 1648 from the Kolyma to the Anadyr River.\r\nAlthough this journey was first critically discussed by G. F.\r\nMüller,[7] its main features were nevertheless well known in Siberia,\r\nand are referred to, among other places, in Strahlenberg's book, whence\r\nthe results appear in Bellini's map in Peter Charlesvoix's \"_Histoire\r\ndu Japan_,\" published in 1735. Unfortunately, however, Bering seems to\r\nhave had no knowledge of Popoff's expedition to the Chukchees peninsula\r\nand his information concerning the adjacent American continent, or of\r\nStrahlenberg's outline maps, which were not published until after his\r\ndeparture from St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nBering's two expeditions are unique in the history of Arctic\r\nexplorations. His real starting point was on the extremest outskirts\r\nof the earth, where only the hunter and yassak-collector had preceded\r\nhim. Kamchatka was at that time just as wild a region as Boothia or the\r\ncoasts of Smith's Sound are in our day, and, practically viewed, it\r\nwas far more distant from St. Petersburg than any known point now is\r\nfrom us. One hundred and thirty degrees--several thousand miles--the\r\nearth's most inhospitable tracts, the coldest regions on the globe,\r\nmountains, endless steppes, impenetrable forests, morasses, and\r\nfields of trackless snow were still between him and the mouth of the\r\nKamchatka River, and thither he was to lead, not a small expedition,\r\nbut an enormous provision train and large quantities of material for\r\nship-building. On the journey, river-boats had to be built by the\r\nscore, and also two ships. Now his course was up the swift streams of\r\nSiberia, and now on horseback or in sledges drawn by dogs through the\r\ndreary and desolate forests of the Yakuts and Tunguses. He employed\r\nseveral hundred laborers and twice as many horses to do work which\r\nmodern ships can accomplish in a few weeks. Franklin, Mackenzie,\r\nSchwatka, and many others have traversed vast tracts of the Arctic\r\nregions, but their expeditions in light sledges can not be compared\r\nwith those burdensome transports which Bering and his men dragged from\r\nthe Gulf of Finland to the shores of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the year 1725 the expedition was ready to start\r\nout from St. Petersburg. The officers were the two Danes, Vitus\r\nBering, captain and chief, and Martin Spangberg, lieutenant and second\r\nin command, and also the following: Lieut. Alexei Chirikoff, Second\r\nLieut. Peter Chaplin, the cartographers Luskin and Patiloff, the mates,\r\nRichard Engel and George Morison, Dr. Niemann, and Rev. Ilarion.[8]\r\nThe subordinates were principally sailors, carpenters, sailmakers,\r\nblacksmiths, and other mechanics.\r\n\r\nPeter the Great died Jan. 28, 1725;[9] but a part of the expedition\r\nunder the command of Lieut. Chirikoff had already started on the 24th;\r\nBering followed Feb. 5. They passed the whole of the first summer in\r\ntoilsome expeditions overland and on rivers in western Siberia. March\r\n16, they arrived at Tobolsk, whence, in May, the journey was continued\r\nwith four rafts and seven boats by way of the rivers Irtish, Obi, Ket,\r\nYenisei, Tunguska, and Ilim, through regions where there was scarcely\r\na Russian _isba_, on rivers which were dangerous on account of hidden\r\nrocks and skerries, and where progress was constantly interrupted by\r\nthe transporting that had to be done between the streams. September 29,\r\nthe expedition arrived at the town of Ilimsk and had to pass the winter\r\nthere. Meanwhile, however, Lieut. Chaplin had, in the spring, been\r\nsent in advance to Yakutsk, in order, at the voivode's (governor's) to\r\nhasten the preparations for transportation in the direction of Okhotsk,\r\nwhither he was to send a small command who were to fell trees and\r\nbegin the work of ship-building. Bering[10] himself went to Irkutsk to\r\nobtain from the governor there information concerning the climate and\r\nphysical features of Eastern Siberia, the modes of travel, and means\r\nof transportation in that distant and little known country. Spangberg\r\nwas sent with mechanics and soldiers to the Kut, a tributary of the\r\nLena, for the purpose of cutting timber and building vessels for the\r\nvoyages to be made in the spring. At Ustkutsk there were built in all\r\nfifteen barges (about 45 feet long, 12 feet wide and 15 inches deep)\r\nand fourteen boats. On May 8, 1726, Spangberg sailed for Yakutsk, and\r\nsomewhat later Chirikoff started off with the rear. By the middle of\r\nJune, the expedition was gathered at the capital of East Siberia, which\r\nat that time had three hundred houses. Here Bering remained until\r\nthe 16th of August, busily engaged in making preparations for the\r\ndifficult journey eastward. He had made two thousand leathern sacks for\r\ntransporting flour to Okhotsk, and gave the voivode orders to keep\r\nin readiness six hundred horses to forward other necessaries for the\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nFrom this point the expedition traveled an entirely untrodden path,\r\nand the 1026 versts (685 miles) to Okhotsk were a severe test of\r\nits endurance. Even in our day, this journey can be made only under\r\nthe greatest difficulties. The region is rough and mountainous, and\r\nintersected by deep streams without bridges or other means of crossing.\r\nThe traveler must traverse dangerous swamps and tundras, or cut his\r\nway through dense forests. In the winter the difficulties are doubled.\r\nHorses, reindeer, and dogs soon become exhausted on these unbroken\r\nroads. A space cleared in the snow, when the cooking, eating, and\r\nsleeping are done, is the only shelter. The temperature falls to -46°\r\nR. (-71° Fahrenheit). Clothing must be changed daily to avoid dampness,\r\nand when the _poorgas_ (blizzards) sweep over the snowy wastes, a few\r\nsteps from camp are often fatal. This is a description of that region\r\nin our day, and it was hardly any more inviting over a hundred and\r\nfifty years ago.\r\n\r\nIt was found necessary to divide the expedition. The branching\r\ntributaries of the Lena offered possibilities for transportation\r\nwhich had to be taken advantage of. Hence, as early as July 7, Lieut.\r\nSpangberg was sent by river with thirteen rafts loaded with materials,\r\nand a force of 204 workmen to reach Yudomskaya Krest by way of the\r\ntributaries Aldan, Maya, and Yudoma, and thence across a ridge down\r\nto the river Urak, which flows into the Sea of Okhotsk. The overland\r\nexpeditions, consisting of 800 horses, were sent in various directions.\r\nBering himself started out on August 16, with 200 horses, and after a\r\njourney of forty-five days, reached Okhotsk. The journey was a very\r\ndifficult one. The horses sought in vain for food under the deep snow.\r\nScores of them were overcome by hunger and exhaustion. The severe cold\r\ncaused the forces much suffering and hardship, nor did they find but\r\nfew comforts when they reached Okhotsk in the latter part of October.\r\nThe town consisted of only eleven huts, with ten Russian families, who\r\nsupported themselves by fishing. Here, too, many of the horses died\r\nfor lack of food, and a herd of heifers sent there by Shestakoff was\r\nlost from the same cause. Only one survived the winter. It was now\r\nnecessary to build huts for the winter. The whole of November was spent\r\nin felling trees, and not until December 2, could Bering take shelter\r\nunder a roof of his own. On the other hand, the ship for the expedition\r\nwas on the stocks, and in spite of all troubles and privations, Bering\r\nfound time to push forward vigorously its construction.\r\n\r\nSpangberg, however, fared worst of all. Winter took him by surprise\r\ntwo hundred and seventy-five miles from Yudomskaya Krest, the nearest\r\ninhabited place, in an entirely barren and swampy region where he could\r\nnot obtain the slightest assistance. His boats and the bulk of their\r\nprovisions had to be left at the confluence of the Yorbovaya and the\r\nYudoma, while he and his men, with what provisions they could take with\r\nthem on the hand-sleds, started out for Okhotsk on foot. Meanwhile,\r\nthe severity of the winter increased, the mercury congealed, and the\r\nsnow was soon six feet deep. This forced them to leave their sleds, and\r\nfor eight full weeks after November 4, these travelers sought shelter\r\nevery night in the snows of Siberia, wrapped in all the furs they could\r\npossibly get hold of. Their provisions were soon exhausted, famine\r\nsoon became a companion to cold, and matters even came to such a pass\r\nthat they were compelled to try to maintain life by gnawing \"straps,\r\nleathern bags, and shoes.\" They would surely have starved to death, had\r\nthey not accidentally happened to strike Bering's route, where they\r\nfound dead horses and a few hundred-weights of flour. December 21,\r\nBering received from Spangberg a message, relating that he had started\r\nfor Yudomskaya Krest with ninety-six sledges, and that he had left the\r\nboats in charge of a mate and six guards. Bering immediately dispatched\r\nten sledges with provisions for his relief, and on the succeeding day,\r\nthirty-seven sledges with thirty-nine men. January 6, 1727, Spangberg\r\nreached Okhotsk, and a few days later his whole command had arrived,\r\neighteen of whom were now sick. Twice during the course of the winter,\r\nSpangberg and Chaplin were obliged to repeat this journey to rescue the\r\nmaterials at the Yudoma. Not until midsummer, 1727, did the rear under\r\nthe command of Chirikoff arrive from Yakutsk.\r\n\r\nAnd yet Bering was far from the place where his work of discovery\r\ncould begin. On June 8, the new ship Fortuna was launched and equipped\r\nfor the prospective voyage. Moreover, the ship that had been used\r\nin exploring the Sea of Okhotsk in 1716 arrived, and after thorough\r\nrepairs was put into the service.\r\n\r\nBering's next objective point was the mouth of the river Bolshoya\r\nin southwestern Kamchatka. From the mouth of this river, which is\r\nnavigable for small vessels, he took the Cossack route to the interior,\r\nfirst up the Bolshoya to the tributary Byistraya, then up this to\r\nwithin forty versts of its source, thence across a portage to the\r\nKamchatka, the mouth of which was his real objective point. From this\r\nposition he would be able to fall back upon the Russian colony, which\r\ncomprised a number of unimportant stockaded forts on the Bolshoya and\r\nKamchatka rivers, and could also gain support from that control of the\r\nnatives which was exercised from this point. This change of base could\r\nhave been much more easily and quickly accomplished by sailing around\r\nthe Kamchatka Peninsula, but this was something that had never been\r\ndone. No accurate information was to be had in regard to the waters, or\r\nto the location of any place. Possibly Bering had not as yet been able\r\nto disabuse his mind of the prevalent delusions concerning the great\r\nextent of Kamchatka. In the second place, he was no doubt unwilling to\r\ntrust his invaluable stores in the inferior vessels built at Okhotsk.\r\nHence he took the old route.\r\n\r\nJuly 1, Spangberg sailed with the Fortuna for Bolsheretsk, accompanied\r\nby thirteen Siberian traders. Two days later Chirikoff brought up the\r\nrear from Yakutsk. Somewhat later, the quartermaster arrived with 110\r\nhorses and 200 sacks of flour. A week later 63 horses more arrived, on\r\nJuly 20, one soldier with 80 horses, and by the 30th over 150 horses\r\nmore, and also 50 oxen.\r\n\r\nAugust 11, Spangberg returned from his voyage to the Bolshoya River,\r\nand on the 19th the whole command went on board,--some on the Fortuna\r\nand others on the old vessel. Their destination was the Bolshoya,\r\nsituated 650 miles from Okhotsk, where they arrived September 4. Here\r\nthe cargoes were transferred to boats and, in the course of the month\r\nof September, brought to the fort, a simple log fortress with seventeen\r\nRussian dwellings and a chapel, twenty miles from the sea. It took the\r\nwhole winter to traverse, first with boats and later with sledges, the\r\n585 miles across Kamchatka, from Bolsheretsk to the lower Kamchatka\r\nfort. Under the greatest difficulties, the expedition now followed\r\nthe course of the Kamchatka River, camping at night in the snow, and\r\nenduring many a fierce struggle with the inclement weather. The natives\r\nwere summoned from far and near to assist in transporting their goods,\r\nbut the undertaking proved fatal to many of them. Finally on March 11,\r\n1728, Bering reached his destination, the lower Kamchatka Ostrog,[11]\r\nwhere he found forty huts scattered along the banks of the river, a\r\nfort, and a church. A handful of Cossacks lived here. They occupied\r\nhuts built above the surface of the ground. They did not always eat\r\ntheir fish raw, but in other respects lived like the natives, and were\r\nin no regard much more civilized than they. The fort was located twenty\r\nmiles from the sea, surrounded by forests of larch, which yielded\r\nexcellent material for ship-building. From this point the exploring\r\nparty proper was to start out.[12]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Note 3.\r\n\r\n[8] Note 4.\r\n\r\n[9] Here as elsewhere, Old Style.\r\n\r\n[10] Note 5.\r\n\r\n[11] An Ostrog is a stockaded post or village.\r\n\r\n[12] Note 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  THE BUILDING OF THE GABRIEL--THE DISCOVERY OF BERING STRAIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nBering now found himself upon the bleak shores of an Arctic sea, with\r\nno other resources than those he had brought with him, or could extort\r\nfrom these barren tracts. He again began the work of ship-building, and\r\nin the summer of 1728, a ship called the Gabriel, staunch enough to\r\nweather a heavy sea, was launched. The timber for this vessel had been\r\nhauled to the ship-yard by dogs; the tar they had prepared themselves,\r\nwhile rigging, cable, and anchors had been dragged nearly two thousand\r\nmiles through one of the most desolate regions of the earth. And as\r\nfor the provisions, they would certainly strike terror in the hearts\r\nof Arctic explorers of to-day. \"Fish oil was his butter, and dried\r\nfish his beef and pork. Salt he was obliged to get from the sea,\"\r\nand according to the directions of the Cossacks he distilled spirits\r\nfrom \"sweet straw.\"[13] Thus supplied with a year's provisions, he\r\nstarted upon his voyage of discovery along an unknown coast and on an\r\nunknown sea. \"It is certain,\" says Dr. Campbell concerning Bering at\r\nthis stage, \"that no person better fitted for this undertaking could\r\nhave been found; no difficulty, no danger daunted him. With untiring\r\nindustry and almost incredible patience he overcame those difficulties\r\nwhich to anyone else would have seemed insurmountable.\"\r\n\r\nOn July 9, the Gabriel started down the river, and on the 13th the\r\nsails were hoisted. The crew numbered forty-four men: namely, one\r\ncaptain, two lieutenants, one second lieutenant, one physician, one\r\nquartermaster, eight sailors, one saddler, one rope-maker, five\r\ncarpenters, one bailiff, two Cossacks, nine soldiers, six servants,\r\none drummer, and two interpreters. Bering's point of departure was\r\nthe lower Kamchatka fort, situated 160° 50' east of Greenwich, the\r\nvariation of the compass being 13° 10' E. The latitude of the cape at\r\nthe mouth of the Kamchatka River was determined as 56° 3' N., which\r\nagrees with the observations made by Cook, who was very near this point\r\non his last voyage. The day was reckoned from 12 o'clock at noon, on\r\nwhich account his dating does not correspond with that of civil time;\r\nhence, the 16th of August with him began on the 15th, at noon. The mile\r\nof the journal is the Italian mile, which is somewhat longer than the\r\nEnglish mile. Bering's course was nearly all the time along the coast,\r\nin from nine to twelve fathoms of water, and usually with land in sight\r\nto the north and west. On July 27, they passed Cape St. Thaddeus at\r\na distance of three miles, and here the sea seemed fairly alive with\r\nspotted whales, seals, sea-lions, and dolphins. After having sailed\r\npast the Anadyr River, without quite being able to find their bearings\r\nin regions of which they had not a single astronomical determination,\r\nand where they were not successful in finding any natives, they\r\nfinally, on July 31, saw land extending along the northern horizon,\r\nand soon afterwards sailed into the Bay of the Holy Cross (St. Kresta\r\nBay) where the Gabriel spent two days under sail in search of fresh\r\nwater and a place to anchor. On the 2d of August the latitude was\r\ndetermined as 60° 50' N., whereupon the voyage was continued to the\r\nsoutheast along the high and rocky coast, where every indentation\r\nwas very carefully explored. August 6, the Gabriel lay in the Bay of\r\nPreobrashensky, and on the 7th, Chaplin was sent ashore to obtain water\r\nfrom a mountain stream. On his way he found huts, where there had quite\r\nrecently been Chukchees, and in various places he found footpaths, but\r\nmet no human beings. On the 8th, Bering sailed along the coast in a\r\nsouth southeasterly direction. At 7 o'clock, a boat containing eight\r\nmen was seen rowing toward the vessel. They did not, however, dare to\r\napproach the Gabriel, but at last one of the number jumped into the\r\nwater, and on two inflated seal bladders swam out to the ship, and\r\nannounced, by the aid of the two Koriak interpreters, that they were\r\nChukchees, and that their people lived along the coast, that they knew\r\nthe Russians well, that the Anadyr River lay far to the west, that the\r\ncontinent extended in the same direction, and that they would soon get\r\nsight of an island. The Koriaks, however, understood his language only\r\nimperfectly, and the journal regrets that they were on this account\r\nprevented from obtaining further important information. Bering gave him\r\nsome small presents and sent him back to try to persuade his companions\r\nto come on board. They approached the vessel, but suddenly turned and\r\ndisappeared. The latitude was 64° 41'.\r\n\r\nAugust 9, Cape Chukotskoi was doubled, an important event in the\r\nhistory of this expedition,--an event which Müller, in order to make\r\nresults fit into his frame, has not even mentioned. The name, it is\r\ntrue, is not found in the journal, but it appears on Bering's chart\r\nin Du Halde's work, which Müller knew. Bering determined the southern\r\nextremity of the cape to be 64° 18', Cook 64° 13'.\r\n\r\nAugust 11, the weather was calm and cloudy. At 2 o'clock in the\r\nafternoon, they saw an island toward the southeast, which Bering, in\r\nhonor of the day, called St. Lawrence. At noon the latitude was found\r\nto be 64° 20', and hence the Gabriel was in the strait between Asia and\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nAugust 12, there was a light breeze and cloudy weather. On this day\r\nthey sailed sixty-nine miles, but the difference in latitude was only\r\n29'. At sunset the longitude was computed by the aid of the variation\r\nof the needle to be 25° 31' east of the lower Kamchatka fort, or 187°\r\n21' east of Greenwich.\r\n\r\nAugust 13, a fresh breeze and cloudy. Bering sailed during the whole\r\nday with land in sight, and the difference in latitude was only 78'.\r\n\r\nAugust 14, weather calm and cloudy. They sailed 29 miles + 8-3/4 miles\r\nfor the current. The course of the current was from south southeast to\r\nnorth northwest. At noon the latitude was 66° 41' when they saw high\r\nland astern, and three hours later high mountains. (East Cape is 66° 6'\r\nN. lat. and 190° 21' east of Greenwich.)\r\n\r\nAugust 15, gentle wind, cloudy weather. From noon until 3 o'clock\r\nBering sailed to the northeast, and after having sailed seven miles\r\nin this direction, he determined to turn back. At 3 o'clock he\r\nannounced, that as he had now accomplished his task, it was his duty,\r\naccording to his orders, to return. His bearings were then 67° 18'\r\nN. latitude, and 30° 19' east of the Kamchatka fort, or 193° 7' east\r\nof Greenwich. In Du Halde, where Bering himself gives his reasons,\r\nit is stated: \"This was Captain Bering's most northerly point. He\r\nthought that he had accomplished his task and obeyed orders, especially\r\nas he no longer could see the coast extending toward the north in\r\nthe same way. (_Surtout, parcequ'il ne voyait plus que les terres\r\ncontinuassent de courier de même du côté du Nord._\") Moreover, if they\r\nshould go farther, he feared, in case they should have adverse winds\r\nthat they might not be able to return to Kamchatka before the end of\r\nthe summer, and how were they to be able to pass the winter in such a\r\nclimate, liable to fall into the hands of a people who had not yet been\r\nsubjugated, and who were human only in outward appearance.[14]\r\n\r\nWhen Bering turned about, his command was to steer south by west,\r\nhalf west. In this course they sailed with the wind at a rate of more\r\nthan seven miles an hour. At 9 o'clock in the morning, they saw a\r\nhigh mountain on the right, where Chukchees lived, and to the left\r\nand seaward they saw an island, which in honor of the day they called\r\nDiomede.[15] This day they sailed 115 miles, and reached latitude 66°\r\n2'.\r\n\r\nOn August 17, Bering again passed the narrowest part of the strait. The\r\nweather was cloudy, there was a fresh breeze, and they sailed along the\r\nAsiatic coast, where they saw many Chukchees, and at two places they\r\nsaw dwellings. The natives fled at the sight of the ship. At 3 o'clock\r\nvery high land and mountains were passed. With a very good breeze, they\r\nhad been enabled to sail 164 miles, and an observation showed that they\r\nwere in latitude 64° 27'. According to this, Bering was out of the\r\nstrait and getting farther and farther away from the American continent.\r\n\r\nAugust 18, the wind was light and the weather clear. On the 20th,\r\nbeyond the Island of St. Lawrence, he met other Chukchees, who told him\r\nthat they had made journeys from the Kolyma River westward to Olenek,\r\nbut that they never went by sea. They knew of the Anadyr fort which lay\r\nfarther to the south; on this coast there dwelt people of their race;\r\nothers they did not know.\r\n\r\nAfter a storm on the 31st of August, in which the main and foresail\r\nwere rent, the anchor cable was broken and the anchor lost, they\r\nreached the mouth of the Kamchatka at 5 o'clock P. M., September 2,\r\n1728.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] Note 7.\r\n\r\n[14] Note 8.\r\n\r\n[15] Note 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  THE TASK ASSIGNED BY PETER THE GREAT ACCOMPLISHED.--HISTORY OF THE\r\n    CARTOGRAPHY OF EAST SIBERIA.--CAPTAIN COOK'S DEFENSE OF BERING.\r\n\r\n\r\nBering turned back because he felt convinced that he had sailed around\r\nthe northeastern corner of Asia, and had demonstrated that in this\r\npart of the earth the two great continents were not connected. The\r\nthird point in his orders was of course dropped, for along the Siberian\r\ncoasts of the Arctic sea, he could expect to find neither European\r\ncolonists nor ships; hence, further search with this object in view\r\nwould be vain. He had a very clear idea of the general outline of\r\neastern Asia, and this knowledge was based upon the facts of his own\r\nvoyage, the information he had obtained in Yakutsk about Deshneff's\r\nexpedition from Kolyma to Anadyr, and upon the account which the\r\nnatives gave of the country and of their commercial journeys westward\r\nto Olenek.\r\n\r\nHe was, moreover, convinced that he had given the search for a\r\nNortheast passage a rational foundation, and his thoughts on this\r\nsubject are found clearly presented in a correspondence from St.\r\nPetersburg to a Copenhagen periodical, _Nye Tidende_, in 1730, whence\r\nthe following: \"_Bering has ascertained that there really does exist\r\na Northeast passage, and that from the Lena River it is possible,\r\nprovided one is not prevented by polar ice, to sail to Kamchatka, and\r\nthence to Japan, China, and the East Indies._\" This correspondence,\r\nwhich appeared immediately after his return on the first of March,\r\n1730, originated either with him or with some of his immediate friends,\r\nand shows that he fully appreciated the extent of his discovery.[16]\r\nIt was this conviction that led him to undertake his next great\r\nenterprise, the navigating and charting of the Northeast passage from\r\nthe Obi River to Japan,--from the known West to the known East.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, the principal result of his work remains as\r\nabove stated. An unhappy fate prevented him from discovering the\r\nadjacent American continent. At the narrowest place, Bering Strait is\r\n39 miles wide; and hence, under favorable conditions, it is possible to\r\nsee simultaneously the coast-lines of both continents.[17] Cook, more\r\nfortunate than Bering, was enabled to do this, for when he approached\r\nthe strait, the sun dispersed the fog, and at one glance both\r\ncontinents were seen. With Bering it was otherwise, for, as we have\r\nseen from his journal, the weather during the whole time that he was in\r\nthe strait, both on the voyage up and back, was dark and cloudy. Not\r\nuntil the 18th of August did the weather clear up, but as the Gabriel\r\nwas sailing before a sharp breeze, he was then too far away to see land\r\non the other side. \"This,\" Von Baer exclaims, \"must be called _bad\r\nluck_.\"\r\n\r\nWe may possibly feel inclined to blame Bering for his haste. Why did\r\nhe not cruise about in the region of 65° to 67° north latitude? A few\r\nhours' sailing would have brought him to the American coast. This\r\nobjection may, however, prove to be illegitimate. The geographical\r\nexplorer, as well as every other investigator, has a right to be judged\r\nfrom the standpoint of his times, and on the basis of his own premises.\r\nBering had no apprehension of an adjacent continent, partly on account\r\nof the Koriak interpreter's imperfect knowledge of the Chukchee\r\ntongue, partly as a result of the fact that the knowledge of the times\r\nconcerning the western coast of America was very meager. This knowledge\r\nextended no farther than to 43° north latitude,--to Cape Blanco in\r\nCalifornia; hence, in the nature of things, he could not be expected to\r\nsearch for land which presumably he knew nothing of. But here we must\r\nalso take into consideration his poor equipment. His cables, ropes,\r\nand sails were in such bad condition, after the three years' transport\r\nthrough Siberia, that he could not weather a storm, and his stock of\r\nprovisions was running so low that it put an unpleasant check on any\r\ninclination to overreach his main object, and this, as we have seen,\r\ndid not include the exploration of an American coast, if separated\r\nfrom Asia. To explore a new coast thirteen degrees of latitude and\r\nthirty degrees of longitude in extent, and make such a chart of it\r\nthat its outline is comparatively correct, and which, for a long time,\r\nwas far superior to anything made afterward,[18] ought certainly to be\r\nconsidered a splendid result, when we remember that the objects of the\r\nexpedition were entirely of a nautico-geographical character. Bering's\r\ndeterminations of longitude in East Siberia were the first made there,\r\nand through them it was ascertained that the country extended thirty\r\ndegrees farther toward the east than was supposed. His observations\r\nwere based on two eclipses of the moon in Kamchatka in the years 1728\r\nand 1729,[19] and although they were not entirely accurate, they vary\r\nso little, that the general position of the country was established.\r\nAnd hence we are not surprised to find that no one has given Bering a\r\nbetter testimonial than his great and more fortunate successor, Captain\r\nCook. He says:[20] \"In justice to the memory of Bering, I must say,\r\nthat he has delineated the coast very well, and fixed the latitude\r\nand longitude of the points better than could be expected from the\r\nmethods he had to go by.\" Yes, Captain Cook found it necessary to\r\ndefend Bering against the only official report of the expedition which\r\nat that time had appeared, and more than once he puts in proper relief\r\nBering's sober investigations, as compared with Müller's fancies and\r\nguesses. Before the time of Cook, it had been customary to depreciate\r\nBering's work;[21] but since that time Admiral Lütke, a hundred years\r\nafter Bering's death, has defended his reputation, and Berch, who very\r\ncarefully perused his journals, repeatedly expresses his admiration\r\nfor the accuracy with which the nautical computations were made. This\r\nstatement is made after a comparison of results with those obtained by\r\nCaptain Cook.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as has already been said, Bering was not aware of the\r\nfact that he was sailing in a comparatively narrow sound,--in that\r\nstrait which has carried his name to posterity. He saw nothing beyond\r\nthe nearest of the Diomede Islands, that is to say, the middle of the\r\nstrait; and this island, as we have seen, is mentioned in the journal\r\nand on the chart, with the latitude correctly given.[22] His name was\r\nnot immediately associated with these regions. The first place, so\r\nfar as I am able to ascertain, that the name Bering Strait appears,\r\nis on a map which accompanies Rob. de Vangondie's \"_Mémoire sur les\r\npays de l'Asie_,\" Paris, 1774. But it is especially to Captain Cook's\r\nhigh-mindedness that the name was retained, for it was used in his\r\ngreat work. Later, Reinholdt Forster, who characterizes Bering as \"a\r\nmeritorious and truly great navigator,\" triumphantly fought his cause\r\nagainst Büsching and others.[23]\r\n\r\nBut even at the present time, an interesting misunderstanding attaches\r\nto this part of Bering's history and the cartography of these regions.\r\nIn our Arctic literature and on all our polar maps, it is asserted\r\nthat Vitus Bering, on his first voyage, turned back at Cape Serdze\r\nKamen. That such a supposition has been able to maintain itself, only\r\nshows how little the original sources of his history are known in West\r\nEurope, and how unheeded they have been in Russia. About a hundred\r\nyears ago the Danish Admiral De Löwenörn and the English hydrographer\r\nA. Dalrymple showed that Frobisher Strait had by some ignorant hand\r\nbeen located on the east coast of Greenland, while it was in reality\r\nlocated on the coast of _Meta incognita_ beyond Davis Strait.[24] A\r\nsimilar error presents itself in connection with Serdze Kamen. It can\r\nbe historically established that this name has been the object of a\r\ndouble change, and that the present Serdze Kamen on the northern coast\r\nof the Chukchee peninsula, has nothing whatever to do with the history\r\nof Bering and his voyage. This misunderstanding is, however, not of\r\nrecent date, for as early as in the first decade after the voyage, it\r\nwas assumed that Bering's course, even after he had passed East Cape,\r\nwas along the coast. Thus I find on a map by Hazius in Nuremberg,\r\n1738,[25] and other maps of about the same time, based on Bering's map\r\nas given by Du Halde, that the Gabriel's turning point is marked by a\r\nstar near the coast with the same latitude as the present Serdze Kamen,\r\nwith the following explanation: \"_Terminus litorum a Navarcho Beerings\r\nrecognitorum._\" This supposition gradually gained ground in West Europe\r\nas well as in Russia, especially so, too, as Bering's new expedition\r\nand consequent death prevented him from correcting the error, and as\r\nthere for a generation was nothing more known of the voyage than the\r\nresumé which appears in Du Halde's work. Moreover, the manner in which\r\nthe coast-line in Bering's original map is extended beyond East Cape,\r\nhas only served to strengthen the opinion. The fact is that Serdze\r\nKamen was a name unknown to Bering. It is found neither on his map, in\r\nhis own account, nor in the ship's journal, and could not be so found\r\nfor a very obvious reason--Bering had never been there.\r\n\r\nAfter having passed East Cape on the 14th of August, he no longer\r\nsailed along the coast. On that day at noon they still saw land astern,\r\nand three hours later, high mountains, but during the succeeding\r\nforty-eight hours land was seen neither to the east nor the west.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the journal gives the turning point as 4° 44' east of\r\nCape Chukotskoi, and Dr. Campbell gives another series of astronomical\r\ndeterminations, sent by Bering from Kamchatka to the Senate in St.\r\nPetersburg, and these show in a striking way that the turning point was\r\neast of the northeastern corner of Asia.\r\n\r\nAccording to these:[26]\r\n\r\nThe Island of St. Lawrence is 64° north latitude and 122° 55' east of\r\nTobolsk.\r\n\r\nThe Island of Diomede is 66° north latitude and 125° 42' east of\r\nTobolsk.\r\n\r\nThe turning point, 67° 18' north latitude and 126° 7' east of Tobolsk.\r\n\r\nHence, Serdze Kamen (67° 3' north latitude and 188° 11' east of\r\nGreenwich), as Berch[27] expressly remarks, must have lain more than\r\nfour degrees west of the turning point. That this must have been\r\nso appears also from the course of the vessel on its return, west\r\nsouthwest, which would have been impossible, if the Gabriel had been\r\nnear the north coast, intending to return through the strait. Among\r\nrecent writers, Von Baer[28] alone critically calls attention to these\r\nfacts, without, however, thoroughly investigating the case. This I\r\nshall now attempt to do.\r\n\r\nThe name Serdze Kamen appears for the first time--historically\r\nspeaking--in Gerhard Fr. Müller's _Sammlung Russischer Geschichte_,\r\nVol. III., 1758.[29] He says: \"Bering finally, in a latitude of 67°\r\n18', reached a headland whence the coast recedes to the west. From this\r\nthe captain drew the very plausible conclusion that he now had reached\r\nthe most northeasterly point of Asia. But here we are forced to admit\r\nthat the circumstance upon which the captain based his conclusion was\r\nfalse, as it has since been learned that the above-mentioned headland\r\nwas identical with the one called Serdze Kamen by the inhabitants\r\nof Fort Anadyr, on account of the promontory being heart-shaped.\"\r\nEven this looks suspicious. The account of some ignorant Cossacks is\r\npresented as a corrective to the report of educated navigators, and it\r\nis also indicated that the garrison at Fort Anadyr had exact knowledge\r\nof the northern coast of the Chukchee peninsula, something it did not\r\nhave at all.[30]\r\n\r\nBut in order to understand Müller, it is necessary to make a slight\r\ndigression. When Bering, in the summer of 1729, was on his return to\r\nSt. Petersburg, he met, between Okhotsk and Yakutsk, the Cossack chief\r\nShestakoff, who by the aid of Bering's ships intended to undertake\r\nan extensive military expedition in the eastern seas. He soon fell,\r\nhowever, in an engagement, but his comrade Captain Pavlutski led an\r\ninvasion into the land of the Chukchees. From Fort Anadyr he went\r\nnorthward to the Arctic Ocean, thence along the coast toward the east,\r\nthen across the Chukchee peninsula to the Pacific. A more detailed\r\naccount than this cannot be given, for his route as indicated on\r\nMüller's map is an impossible one. This much, however, seems to be\r\nirrefutable: shortly after having crossed the Chukchee peninsula in a\r\nsoutherly direction, he came to a sea, and this sea could be no other\r\nthan Bering Sea.[31] Moreover, it appears from the account, that he was\r\non his return to the fort. Müller goes on to say: \"From here he sent\r\na part of his men in boats, whither he himself with the majority of\r\nthe party proceeded by land, following the shore, which at this place\r\nextended toward the southeast. Those in boats were so near the shore\r\nthat they reported to him every evening. On the seventh day, the party\r\nin boats came to the mouth of a river, and twelve days later, to the\r\nmouth of another. At about seven miles from this point there extends\r\neastward far into the sea a headland, which is first mountainous, but\r\nthen flat, as far as the eye can reach. This headland is probably\r\nwhat induced Captain Bering to turn back. Among the mountains on this\r\npromontory there is one which, as already noted, is by the natives of\r\nAnadyrskoi Ostrog called Serdze Kamen. From here Pavlutski started for\r\nthe interior.\" On this loose reasoning rests Serdze Kamen,--a process\r\nof reasoning which attempts to show clearly that this headland must be\r\na point on the Pacific coast, and that it must have lain many days'\r\njourney west of Bering Strait. But how is it possible, that Müller\r\ncould have been so confused as to make such strange blunders? The case\r\ncould not thus have presented itself to him. On the basis of Deshneff's\r\njourney and Pavlutski's cruise, he formed in his imagination a picture\r\nof northeastern Siberia, in which the Chukchee peninsula assumed a\r\ndouble horned shape, or--as Von Baer expresses it--resembled a bull's\r\nhorn.\r\n\r\nHe used Bering's chart as a foundation when he had no other, but he\r\nomitted Cape Chukotskoi, and on the 66th parallel he inserted Serdze\r\nKamen. From this point he made the coast recede, first westward, then\r\nnorthward and eastward to a large circular peninsula situated between\r\n72°-75° north latitude, which he called Chukotskoi Noss. It is this\r\nimaginary peninsula which Pavlutski crosses. He accordingly reaches the\r\nPacific coast to the north of Bering Strait, and in this way Müller\r\nsucceeds in locating Serdze Kamen north of the strait. Hence, according\r\nto Müller's opinion, Bering had never doubled the northeastern corner\r\nof Asia, and he had never been out of the Pacific. \"And although the\r\ncoast beyond Serdze Kamen,\" he says, \"turns westward, it forms only\r\na large bay, and the coast-line again takes a northerly direction to\r\nChukotskoi Noss, a large peninsula in a latitude of 70° or more, and\r\nwhere it would first be possible to say authoritatively that the two\r\nhemispheres were not connected. But how could all this have been known\r\non the ship? The correct idea of the shape of the land of the Chukchees\r\nand the peninsula bearing the same name, is due to geographical\r\ninvestigations instituted by me at Yakutsk in 1736 and 1737.\"\r\n\r\nBlinded by the archival dust of Yakutsk, Müller confused everything.\r\nCape Chukotskoi, which Bering had found to be in latitude 64° 18' N.,\r\nwas placed beyond 72° N.; Bering's most northerly point, which lay\r\nfar out in the sea, was changed to a headland in latitude 66° N.,\r\nand, misled by some vague reports from the garrison at Fort Anadyr, he\r\ncalled this point Serdze Kamen. Everything is guess-work!\r\n\r\nBut where did Müller get his Serdze Kamen, and what place was it\r\nthat the garrison at Fort Anadyr called by this name? For of the\r\nextreme northeast part of the peninsula, or the details of Bering's\r\nvoyage--especially as early as in 1730--they could have had no\r\nknowledge. The explanation is not difficult. On Russian maps of the\r\nlast century, those of Pallas and Billings, for example,[32] there is\r\nfound on the eastern shore of St. Kresta Bay, somewhat northeast of the\r\nmouth of the Anadyr, a cape which bears the name of Serdze Kamen. As\r\nBering does not have this name, and as it seems to have been known as\r\nearly as at the time of Pavlutski, it must have originated either with\r\nhim and the Cossacks at the fort, or with the Chukchees. Sauer relates\r\nthe following concerning the origin of the name: \"Serdze Kamen is a\r\nvery remarkable mountain projecting into the bay at Anadyr. The land\r\nside of this mountain has many caves, to which the Chukchees fled when\r\nPavlutski attacked them, and from where they killed a large number of\r\nRussians as they passed. Pavlutski was consequently obliged to seek\r\nreinforcements at Anadyr, where he told that the Chukchees shot his\r\nmen from the _heart_ of the _cliff_, and hence it received the name of\r\nSerdze Kamen, or the heart-cliff.\" But this account, which finds no\r\nauthority whatever in Sauer's work, is severely criticised by Lütke,\r\nwho calls attention to the fact that the Chukchees called a mountain on\r\nthe eastern shore of the St. Kresta Bay _Linglin Gaï_, that is, the\r\nheart-cliff. It is quite improbable that they got this name from the\r\nCossacks in Anadyrsk, and hence we here undoubtedly have the origin of\r\nthe name.[33]\r\n\r\nIn Steller's various works one can see what confused ideas concerning\r\nBering's first expedition the academists who wrote his history really\r\nhad. They succeeded in bringing confusion into the simplest questions,\r\nand, as a result, wrecked his reputation. In Steller's description\r\nof Kamchatka, where he enumerates the headlands of the peninsula, a\r\nremarkable statement is found, which offers excellent proof of the\r\ncorrectness of Lütke's opinion.[34] The situation of Serdze Kamen\r\nbetween East Cape and the mouth of the Anadyr is here distinctly given.\r\nHence, according to his opinion, Bering reached no farther than to St.\r\nKresta Bay, and the sarcastic remarks plainly show Steller's partisan\r\nview.[35] Müller was not so rash. When he moved Cape Chukotskoi half\r\na dozen degrees farther to the north, he moved Serdze Kamen also, and\r\n_carried it from St. Kresta Bay up into Bering Strait_.\r\n\r\nIn this cool move he was fortunate enough to get into a closer\r\nagreement with Bering's determination of latitude, but unfortunately\r\nhit upon new difficulties. His own map is based upon Bering's, as he\r\nhad no other, but Bering's voyage did not, as is well known, end at any\r\nheadland. Neither his chart nor his journal supports any such theory,\r\nand hence Müller, either accidentally or purposely, does not in his\r\nbook have a word about the voyage from the 10th to the 15th of August,\r\nand on his map (1758) Bering's \"track\" is broken off near East Cape.\r\nThis headland is Müller's Serdze Kamen,[36] a fact of which even a very\r\ncursory glance at Müller's and Bering's maps will convince any one. But\r\neven Bering had located the northeastern corner of Asia (East Cape) a\r\nfew minutes too far northward, and in order to make the map coincide\r\nwith his theory and with Bering's computations, Müller made the error\r\ngreater, without, however, fixing it at Bering's turning-point, but at\r\n67° 18' N. lat., where, according to Bering's and his own account, it\r\nought to be.\r\n\r\nThus matters stood up to the time of Cook's third voyage. But as Cook\r\nhad on board, not only Müller's book and map in an English translation,\r\nbut also Bering's map, and an excellent treatise by Dr. Campbell in\r\nHarris's Collection of Voyages, he could pass judgment while at the\r\nplace in question. As a matter of course he upholds Bering. Hence, it\r\nwas a natural result that Serdze Kamen, which, as we have seen, was\r\nto coincide with the most northerly point reached by Bering, could no\r\nlonger retain its position in the latitude of East Cape, which was more\r\nthan a degree too far south; and in order to make Müller's account\r\nintelligible, Captain Cook had the choice between entirely expunging\r\nthe name, or bringing it up to an approximately correct latitude. Cook\r\nchose the latter; and to this mistake on his part it is due that the\r\nlast splinter of Müller's vain structure passed into the cartography\r\nof the future. In latitude 67° 3' N., Cook found a projecting\r\npromontory with many crags and peaks, and \"possibly one or another of\r\nthem may be heart-shaped. This peak we have, on Müller's authority,\r\ncalled Serdze Kamen.\"[37]\r\n\r\nHere then we have the third Serdze Kamen, and we can now see how it\r\nhas wandered about the northeast corner of Asia. As a matter of fact,\r\nit is situated in a latitude nearly the same as the most northerly\r\npoint reached by Bering, but unfortunately this does not at all answer\r\nMüller's description. It does not project eastward into the sea, but on\r\nthe contrary, its main direction is toward the northwest. At the base\r\nof this headland, the coast does not in a striking manner extend toward\r\nthe west, but continues in its former direction. Nor does it consist of\r\nsteep rocks and a low point extending farther than the eye can reach.\r\nIn other words, the present Serdze Kamen has nothing whatever to do\r\neither with Bering's voyage or Müller's description.[38]\r\n\r\nTo this period of Bering's history another observation must be made.\r\nIn his excellent treatise entitled, \"What Geography owes to Peter\r\nthe Great,\" Von Baer tries to show that Bering turned back in his\r\ncourse, not on the 15th, but on the 16th of August, and that too,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that both Bering and Müller, in print, give\r\nthe former date,--yes, notwithstanding the fact that Von Baer himself\r\nhad an autograph card from Bering which likewise gives the 15th. In\r\nhis criticism on this point, Von Baer based his statements on those\r\nextracts of the ship's journal referred to above, which as we have\r\nseen give the 16th of August, and this, in his opinion, must be\r\ndecisive. But the disagreement in these sources is only an apparent\r\none. As we already have noted, Bering reckoned the day from 12 o'clock\r\nat noon. Hence the journal's 16th of August began at noon on the 15th\r\nof August, and as Bering turned back at 3 o'clock in the afternoon,\r\nthis occurred on the 15th of August according to the calendar, and on\r\nthe 16th of August according to the artificial day of the journal. Thus\r\nVon Baer's correction is based on a misunderstanding.[39] That this\r\nview of the question is correct is seen also from that passage in the\r\njournal where the Island of St. Lawrence is mentioned. According to the\r\njournal this island was passed at 2 o'clock P.M. on the 11th of August,\r\nand Berch, to whom we are indebted for information concerning Bering's\r\nday, is, strange to say, surprised to think that Bering named the\r\nisland in honor of the saint of the preceding day, notwithstanding that\r\nthe 11th at 2 o'clock P. M. is in reality, according to the calendar\r\nday, the 10th of August, St. Lawrence Day. The first twelve hours of\r\nthe journal's day belong to the preceding day. Hence, Bering turned\r\nback August 15, at 3 o'clock P. M.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] Note 10.\r\n\r\n[17] Note 11.\r\n\r\n[18] Note 12.\r\n\r\n[19] Note 13.\r\n\r\n[20] Note 14.\r\n\r\n[21] Note 15.\r\n\r\n[22] Note 16.\r\n\r\n[23] Note 17.\r\n\r\n[24] Note 18.\r\n\r\n[25] Note 19.\r\n\r\n[26] Note 20.\r\n\r\n[27] Note 21.\r\n\r\n[28] Note 22.\r\n\r\n[29] Note 23.\r\n\r\n[30] Note 24.\r\n\r\n[31] Note 25.\r\n\r\n[32] Note 26.\r\n\r\n[33] Note 27.\r\n\r\n[34] The passage is: \"_Das Tschuktschische Vorgebürge in Nord Osten_,\r\n(elsewhere he locates it in latitude 66° N.), _ein anderes 2 Grad\r\nohngefaehr südlicher, Sirza-kamen, der Herzstein gennent, der auch\r\nbey der ersten Expedition der herzlichen Courage der See-Officier\r\ndie Gränzen gesetzt.

Who commanded the vessel on this voyage, can not\r\nbe ascertained.\r\n\r\nBering wintered at the fort. On the days that it was light, the men\r\nwere busy at work or receiving instructions, and thus the winter passed\r\nwithout any remarkable occurrences or misfortunes. Spangberg, however,\r\nwas obliged, on account of illness, to go to Bolsheretsk.[40]\r\n\r\nAt lower Kamchatskoi Ostrog, Bering became convinced that there must\r\nbe a large wooded country not far to the east. The waves were more\r\nlike those of a sea than of an ocean. The driftwood did not indicate\r\nthe flora of eastern Asia, and the depth of the sea grew less toward\r\nthe north; the east wind brought drift-ice to the mouth of the river\r\nafter three days, the north wind, on the other hand, after five days.\r\nThe birds of passage came to Kamchatka from the east. The reports of\r\nthe natives corroborated his inferences. They declared that they were\r\nable, in very clear weather, to see land in the east (Bering Island),\r\nand that in the year 1715 a man had stranded there, who said that his\r\nnative land was far to the east and had large rivers and forests with\r\nvery high trees. All this led Bering to believe that a large country\r\nlay toward the northeast at no very great distance.\r\n\r\nIn the summer or 1729, he started out to find this country, leaving\r\nthe mouth of the Kamchatka for the east, July 6. If the wind had been\r\nfavourable, he would very soon have reached Bering Island, where twelve\r\nyears later he was buried. He must have been very near this island,\r\ninvisible to him, however, on account of a fog; but on the 8th of\r\nJuly he was struck by a severe storm, which the frail vessel and the\r\nweather-worn rigging could not defy, and hence on the 9th, he headed\r\nfor the southern point of Kamchatka. But also on this voyage he did\r\ngeographical service by determining the location of the peninsula and\r\nthe northern Kurile Islands, as well as exploring the channel between\r\nthem, and thus finding for the Russian mariner a new and easier route\r\nto Kamchatka. Berch says, that although Bering had adverse winds on the\r\nvoyage to Bolsheretsk, all his computations are quite accurate; the\r\ndifference in latitude between the latter place and lower Kamchatka\r\nOstrog is given as 6° 29', which is very nearly correct. Bering\r\nlikewise determined the location of Cape Lopatka at 51° N. lat.\r\n\r\nAt Bolsheretsk Bering collected his men, distributed provisions and\r\npowder, left the Fortuna with a crew of one corporal and eleven men,\r\nand on the 14th of July steered for Okhotsk. After a fortunate, but not\r\notherwise remarkable, journey, he reached St. Petersburg on the 1st of\r\nMarch, 1730. \"From the perusal of his ship's journal,\" says Berch, \"one\r\nbecomes convinced that our famous Bering was an extraordinarily able\r\nand skillful officer; and if we consider his defective instruments,\r\nhis great hardships, and the obstacles that had to be overcome, his\r\nobservations and the great accuracy of his journal deserve the highest\r\npraise. He was a man who did Russia honor.\"\r\n\r\nBering had thus done good work in the service of Asiatic geography.\r\nHe had shown that he possessed an explorer's most important\r\nqualification--never to make positive statements where there is no\r\ndefinite knowledge. By virtue of his extensive travels in northeastern\r\nAsia, his scientific qualifications, his ability to make careful,\r\naccurate observations, and his own astronomical determinations, and\r\nby virtue of his direct acquaintance with Kosyrefsky's and Lushin's\r\nworks, he was in a position to form a more correct opinion than any\r\ncontemporary concerning this part of the earth. In spite of these\r\ngreat advantages in his favor, his work was rejected by the leading\r\nauthorities in St. Petersburg. It is true that Bering found sincere\r\nsupport in the able and influential Ivan Kirilovich Kiriloff, but\r\nto no one else could he turn for a just and competent judge. The\r\ngreat Russian empire had not yet produced a scientific aristocracy.\r\nThe Academy of Science, which had been founded five or six years\r\nprevious, was not composed of able scholars, but of a number of\r\nmore or less talented contestants for honor and fame,--of men who\r\noccupied a prominent yet disputed position in a foreign and hostile\r\ncountry--young, hot-headed Germans and Frenchmen who had not yet\r\nachieved complete literary recognition. Such people are stern and\r\nsevere judges. Bering was unfortunate enough to fall into the hands\r\nof the German Gerhard Fr. Müller and the Frenchman Joseph Nicolas De\r\nl'Isle.\r\n\r\nAlthough Müller had not yet seen Siberia, and although it was\r\nnot until ten years later that he succeeded in building that\r\ngeographical card-house which Captain Cook so noiselessly blew down,\r\nhe nevertheless, even at that time, on every occasion expressed the\r\nopinion that Bering had not reached the northeast point of Asia, and\r\nthat his voyage had consequently not accomplished its purpose. De\r\nl'Isle was Bering's intellectual antipode. As a geographer he delighted\r\nin moving about on the borderland of the world's unexplored regions.\r\nHis element was that of vaguest conjecture,--the boldest combinations\r\nof known and unknown; and even as an old man he did not shrink from\r\nthe task of constructing, from insufficient accounts of travels and\r\napocryphal sailor-stories, a map of the Pacific, of which not a\r\nsingle line has been retained. He overstrained himself on the fame\r\nof his deceased brother, whose methods, inclinations, and valuable\r\ngeographical collections he had inherited, but unfortunately not\r\nthat intuitive insight which made Guillaume De l'Isle the leading\r\ngeographer of his age. Hence, as a geographer, he was merely an echo of\r\nhis brother.\r\n\r\nOne of Guillaume De l'Isle's most famous essays had been on the island\r\nof Yezo. In 1643 the stadtholder of Batavia, the able Van Diemen,\r\nsent the ships Kastrikon and Breskens under the command of Martin de\r\nVries and Hendrick Corneliszoon Schaep to Japan for the purpose of\r\nnavigating the east coast of the island of Nipon (Hondo), and thence\r\ngo in search of America by sailing in a northwesterly direction to the\r\n45th degree of latitude; but in case they did not find America, which\r\npeople continued to believe lay in these regions, they were to turn\r\ntoward the northeast and seek the coast of Asia on the 56th degree\r\nof latitude. De Vries partly carried out his chimerical project. At\r\n40° north latitude he saw the coast of Nipon, two degrees farther\r\nnorth, the snow-capped mountains of Yezo, and thence sailed between\r\nthe two Kuriles lying farthest to the south, which he called Staaten\r\nEiland and Kompagniland. He then continued his voyage into the Sea\r\nof Okhotsk to 48° north latitude, where he turned about, saw Yezo\r\nin latitude 45°, but came, without noticing La Perouse Strait, over\r\nto Saghalin, which he considered a part of Yezo, and as he followed\r\nthe coast of Saghalin to Cape Patience in latitude 48°, he thought\r\nYezo a very extensive island on the eastern coast of Asia. Through\r\nthe cartography of the seventeenth century, for example Witsen's and\r\nHomann's Atlas, but especially through Guillaume De l'Isle's globes\r\nand maps, these erroneous ideas were scattered over the earth, and,\r\nwhen the first accounts of Kamchatka, without being accompanied by\r\na single astronomical determination, reached Europe, many believed\r\nthat this land was identical with Yezo. But as De Vries had left some\r\ndeterminations of latitude and longitude which showed that the island\r\nmust be very near Japan, some went even so far as to suppose that it\r\nwas contiguous to Nipon; indeed, Guillaume De l'Isle's essay attempted\r\nto prove this. Thus three lands were made one, while De Vries's\r\nStaaten Eiland and Kompagniland, which could find no place in this\r\nseries, were forced eastward into the Pacific as large tracts of land\r\nseparated from Kamchatka-Yezo and from each other by narrow straits.\r\nBut this is not all. The Portuguese cosmographer Texeïra had in 1649,\r\nin these same regions, indicated a coast projecting far to the east\r\ntoward America, seen by Juan de Gama on a voyage to New Spain from the\r\nPhilippine Islands. This Gamaland was now described as a continuation\r\nof Kompagniland. In Homann's Atlas, 1709, it is represented as a part\r\nof America, and Guillaume De l'Isle varied on the theme in a different\r\nway.[41]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately these ideas held sway in the scientific world when\r\nBering, in 1730, returned. Furthermore, scholars thought these ideas\r\nwere confirmed by Swedish prisoners of war who had returned from\r\nSiberia, especially by the famous Tabbert, or Strahlenberg, as he was\r\nlater called, whose various imaginary chart-outlines had been adopted\r\nin Homann's Atlas, 1727, and in other West European geographical works\r\nthen in vogue.[42]\r\n\r\nBering returned. His sober accounts and accurate maps, in which there\r\nwas nothing imaginary whatever, were now to take up the fight against\r\nthese prejudices. Bering declared that he had sailed around Kamchatka\r\nwithout having seen anything of these lands, although he had--in a\r\ndifferent direction, however--noticed signs of land. On his map,\r\nKamchatka was represented as a definitely defined region, and hence\r\nGuillaume De l'Isle's structure had received its first blow, in case\r\nBering's representations should be accepted. But Bering's reputation\r\nhad been undermined in still another direction. The above-mentioned\r\nCossack chief Shestakoff had, during his sojourn in Russia, distributed\r\nvarious rough contour sketches of northeastern Asia. This brave\r\nwarrior, however, knew just as little about wielding a pen as he did a\r\npencil. The matter of a few degrees more or less in some coast-lines\r\ndid not seriously trouble him. Even his own drawings did not agree.\r\nNortheast of the Chukchee peninsula he had sketched an extensive\r\ncountry, which Bering had not seen.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of Joseph De l'Isle that he accepted both\r\nShestakoff and Strahlenberg, and as late as in 1753 still clung to\r\ntheir outlines. In the first place, it satisfied his family pride to\r\nbe able to maintain his brother's views of the cartography of these\r\nregions (and of his views Strahlenberg's were but an echo), and it\r\nmoreover satisfied his predisposition to that which was vague and\r\nhypothetical. At first De l'Isle succeeded in carrying out his wishes,\r\nand in 1737 the Academy published a map of Asia in which it would prove\r\nextremely difficult to find any trace of Bering's discoveries.[43]\r\nIt was accordingly quite the proper thing to consider Bering's first\r\nexpedition wholly, or at least to a great extent, unsuccessful. In\r\nthe literature of that day there are evidences of this, especially in\r\nSteller's writings. He treats Bering with scornful superiority, which\r\nis particularly out of place, as he shows himself a poor judge in\r\ngeographical matters.[44] Kiriloff, who in his general map of Russia in\r\n1734[45] unreservedly accepted Bering's map, was the only man who gave\r\nhim due recognition. The Academy could not persuade itself to make use\r\nof the only scientifically obtained outline map in existence of the\r\nremotest regions of the empire, until Bering, many years afterwards,\r\nhad won full recognition in Paris, Nuremberg, and London. Bering's map\r\nwas made in Moscow in 1731, and the Russian government presented it\r\nto the king of Poland,[46] who gave it to the Jesuit father Du Halde.\r\nHe had it printed and inserted in D'Anville's _Nouvelle Atlas de la\r\nChine_, a supplement to his large work on China, to which we have\r\nseveral times referred.[47] Of this work Dr. Campbell later gave an\r\naccount in Harris's Collection of Voyages, and it was, furthermore, the\r\nbasis of the better class of geographical works on eastern Asia of last\r\ncentury until Captain Cook's day. A copy of the eastern half of the map\r\nwill be found in the appendix to this treatise.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[40] A port on the southern coast of Kamchatka.\r\n\r\n[41] See Maps II. and III.\r\n\r\n[42] Note 33.\r\n\r\n[43] Note 34.\r\n\r\n[44] Note 35.\r\n\r\n[45] Note 36.\r\n\r\n[46] Note 37.\r\n\r\n[47] Note 38.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT NORTHERN EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  BERING'S PLANS FOR A SECOND EXPEDITION.--THE GREATEST GEOGRAPHICAL\r\n    ENTERPRISE EVER UNDERTAKEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nArctic exploration has a bewitching power over its devotees. Bering and\r\nhis companions did not escape the enchantment. Hardly had they returned\r\nfrom a five years' sojourn in the extremest corner of the world, when\r\nthey declared themselves willing to start out again. As they had met\r\nwith so much doubt and opposition from scholars,--had learned that\r\nthe world's youngest marine lacked the courage to recognize its own\r\ncontributions to science, and, furthermore, as the Admiralty thought it\r\nhad given strong reasons for doubting Bering's results,[48] he proposed\r\nto make his future explorations on a larger scale and remove all doubt,\r\nby charting the whole of this disputed part of the globe.\r\n\r\nApril 30, 1730, only two months after his return, he presented two\r\nplans to the Admiralty. These have been found and published by Berch,\r\nand are of the greatest importance in judging of Bering's true relation\r\nto the Great Northern Expedition. In the first of these propositions\r\nhe sets forth a series of suggestions for the administration of\r\nEast Siberia, and for a better utilization of its resources. He\r\ndesired, among other things, missionary work among the Yakuts, better\r\ndiscipline among the East Siberian Cossacks, more honesty among the\r\nyassak-collectors, the opening of iron mines at Okhotsk and Udinsk, and\r\nvarious other things. But it was never his intention to carry out these\r\npropositions himself, and it was a great mistake for the government to\r\nburden his instructions with such purely administrative work.\r\n\r\nHis second proposition is incomparably more interesting. In this he\r\nindicates the general outline of his Great Northern Expedition, the\r\ngreatest geographical enterprise that the world has hitherto known.\r\nThis document shows that he was the originator of the plan, something\r\nthat has been contradicted, and but for this document might still\r\nstand contradicted. He proposed to start out from Kamchatka to explore\r\nand chart the western coast of America and establish commercial\r\nrelations with that country, thence to visit Japan and Amoor for the\r\nsame purpose, and finally to chart either by land or sea the Arctic\r\ncoast of Siberia,--namely, from the Obi to the Lena.[49] Through\r\nthese three enterprises and his former expedition, it was Bering's\r\nobject to fill the vacant space on his chart between the known West\r\nand the known East,--between the Kara Sea and the Japan Islands. He\r\nrefused to corroborate his first observations by again visiting the\r\nsame localities, and he rightly concluded, that absolute proof of the\r\nseparation of the continents would be ascertained if the American coast\r\nwere charted.\r\n\r\nThe political situation in the empire favored the adoption of Bering's\r\nplans. The Duchess of Courland, Anna Ivanovna, had just (1730) ascended\r\nthe throne. With her the foreigners and Peter's reform party again\r\ncame into power, and with much more zeal than skill, they sought to\r\ncontinue Peter's work. Anna aimed to shine in Europe as the ruler of a\r\ngreat power, and in Russia as a West European queen. Europe was to be\r\nawed by Russian greatness, and Russia by European wisdom. In one of his\r\nhigh-flown speeches Czar Peter had given assurance that science would\r\nforsake its abodes in West Europe, and in the fullness of time cast a\r\nhalo of immortal glory around the name of Russia.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to speed this time. Anna and her coadjutors had an\r\ninsatiable desire for the splendor and exterior luster of culture.\r\nLike upstarts in wealth they sought to surround themselves with some\r\nof that glory which only gray-haired honor can bestow. One of the\r\nsurest ways to this glory was through the equipment of scientific\r\nexpeditions. They had at their disposal an academy of science, a fleet,\r\nand the resources of a mighty empire. The sacrifice of a few thousand\r\nhuman lives troubled them but little, and they exerted themselves to\r\nmake the enterprise as large and sensational as possible. Bering's\r\nabove-mentioned proposition was taken as a foundation for these plans,\r\nbut when, after the lapse of two years, his proposition left the\r\nvarious departments of the government--the Senate, the Academy, and\r\nthe Admiralty--it had assumed such proportions that he found great\r\ndifficulty in recognizing it.\r\n\r\nAfter having on April 30, 1730, submitted to the Admiralty his new\r\nproposition, together with the accounts and reports of his first\r\nexpedition, Bering was sent to Moscow, where Anna maintained her court\r\nduring the first few years of her reign. Here he laid his plans before\r\nthe Senate, and made the map before referred to; but all the leading\r\nmen were then too much occupied with court intrigues to be able to give\r\nhis plans any of their attention. Separated from his family, he wearied\r\nof life in Moscow, and on January 5, 1732, the Senate gave him leave\r\nof absence to go to St. Petersburg, on condition that Chaplin and the\r\nsteward would conclude the reports. Moreover, the Senate ordered that\r\nthe Admiralty should pay Bering's claims against the government for his\r\nservices. In view of the hardships he had endured, he received 1,000\r\nrubles, double the amount to which he was entitled according to the\r\nregulations of the department. Almost simultaneously he was promoted,\r\nin regular succession, to the position of _capitain-commandeur_ in the\r\nRussian fleet, the next position below that of rear-admiral.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1732, Anna, Biron, and Ostermann had succeeded in\r\ncrushing the Old Russian opposition. The leaders of this party,\r\nespecially the family of Dolgoruki, had been either banished to\r\nSiberia or scattered about in the provinces and in fortresses, and now\r\nthere was nothing to hinder the government in pursuing its plans. As\r\nearly as April 17, the Empress[50] ordered that Bering's proposition\r\nshould be executed, and charged the Senate to take the necessary\r\nsteps for this purpose. The Senate, presided over by Ivan Kiriloff,\r\nan enthusiastic admirer of Peter the Great, acted with dispatch. On\r\nMay 2, it promulgated two ukases, in which it declared the objects of\r\nthe expedition, and sought to indicate the necessary means. Although\r\nthe Senate here in the main followed Bering's own proposition and\r\nmade a triple expedition (an American, a Japanese, and an Arctic), it\r\nnevertheless betrayed a peculiar inclination to burden the chief of\r\nthe expedition with tasks most remote from his own original plans. It\r\ndirected him not only to explore the Shantar Islands and reach the\r\nSpanish possessions in America, something that Bering had never thought\r\nof, but also included in its ukase a series of recommendations for the\r\ndevelopment of Siberia,--recommendations which Bering had previously\r\nmade to the government, and which had already provoked some definite\r\nefforts, as the exiled Pissarjeff, a former officer of the Senate, had\r\nbeen removed to Okhotsk to develop that region and extend the maritime\r\nrelations on the Pacific.\r\n\r\nHe seems, however, not to have accomplished anything, and the Senate\r\nthought it feasible to burden Bering with a part of this task. He\r\nwas directed to supply Okhotsk with more inhabitants, to introduce\r\ncattle-raising on the Pacific coast, to found schools in Okhotsk for\r\nboth elementary and nautical instruction, to establish a dock-yard in\r\nthis out-of-the-way corner, to transport men and horses to Yudomskaya\r\nKrest, and to establish iron-works at Yakutsk, Udinsk, and other\r\nplaces. But this was simply the beginning of the avalanche, and as it\r\nrolled along down through the Admiralty and Academy, it assumed most\r\nstartling dimensions. These authorities aspired to nothing less than\r\nraising all human knowledge one step higher. The Admiralty desired\r\nthe expedition to undertake the nautical charting of the Old World\r\nfrom Archangel to Nipon--even to Mexico; and the Academy could not\r\nbe satisfied with anything less than a scientific exploration of all\r\nnorthern Asia. As a beginning, Joseph Nicolas De l'Isle, professor of\r\nastronomy at the Academy, was instructed to give a graphic account of\r\nthe present state of knowledge of the North Pacific, and in a memoir to\r\ngive Bering instructions how to find America from the East. The Senate\r\nalso decreed that the former's brother, Louis, surnamed La Croyère, an\r\nadventurer of somewhat questionable character, should accompany the\r\nexpedition as astronomer. Thus decree after decree followed in rapid\r\nsuccession. On December 28, the Senate issued a lengthy ukase, which,\r\nin sixteen paragraphs, outlined _in extenso_ the nautico-geographical\r\nexplorations to be undertaken by the expedition. Commodore Bering and\r\nLieut. Chirikoff, guided by the instructions of the Academy, were to\r\nsail to America with two ships for the purpose of charting the American\r\ncoast. They were to be accompanied by La Croyère, who, with the\r\nassistance of the surveyors Krassilnikoff and Popoff, was to undertake\r\na series of local observations through Siberia, along several of the\r\nlargest rivers of the country and in its more important regions, across\r\nthe Pacific, and also along the coast of the New World. With three\r\nships Spangberg was to sail to the Kurile Islands, Japan, and the still\r\nmore southerly parts of Asia, while simultaneously the coast from\r\nOkhotsk to Uda, to Tugur, to the mouth of the Amoor, and the coasts of\r\nthe Shantar Islands and Saghalin were to be charted.\r\n\r\nEven these tasks exceeded all reasonable demands, and not until several\r\ngenerations later did Cook, La Perouse, and Vancouver succeed in\r\naccomplishing what the Russian Senate in a few pen-strokes directed\r\nBering to do. And yet, not until the government touched the Arctic\r\nside of this task, did it entirely lose sight of all reason. Its\r\ninstructions to Bering were, not only to chart the coast of the Old\r\nWorld from the Dwina to the Pacific, to explore harbors and estuaries\r\nalong this coast, to describe the country and study its natural\r\nresources, especially its mineral wealth, but also to dispatch an\r\nexpedition to the Bear Islands, off the mouth of the Kolyma, and to see\r\nto it that his earlier trip to the Chukchee peninsula was repeated,\r\nbesides sailing from there to America, as the results of his former\r\nvoyage \"were unsatisfactory,\" reliable information concerning that\r\ncountry having been received from the Cossack Melnikoff.\r\n\r\nAll these expeditions were to start out from the great Siberian\r\nrivers,--from the Dwina to the Obi with two vessels under the charge\r\nof the Admiralty; from the Obi and Lena with three twenty-four-oared\r\nboats, two of which were to meet between these two rivers, and the\r\nthird was to sail around Bering's Peninsula (this Reclus calls the\r\nChukchee peninsula), or, if America proved to be connected with that\r\ncountry, it was to attempt to find European colonies. The orders of the\r\nSenate were, furthermore, to the effect that surveyors should be sent\r\nout in advance for the preliminary charting of these river-mouths, and\r\nto erect light-houses, establish magazines for convenient relays, and\r\nprocure provisions and other necessaries,--very excellent directions,\r\nall of which, however, were so many meaningless words after they had\r\nleft the government departments. Our age, which still has in mind the\r\nFranklin expeditions--the English parallel--is able to form an idea of\r\nthese gigantic demands, and yet the Senate did not hesitate to load\r\nthe organization of all this upon the shoulders of one man. Bering was\r\nmade chief of all the enterprises east of the Ural Mountains. At the\r\nObi and the Lena, at Okhotsk and Kamchatka, he was to furnish ships,\r\nprovisions, and transportation.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all that was vague and visionary in these plans,\r\nthey had nevertheless a certain homogeneity. They were all nautical\r\nexpeditions for nautical purposes and nautico-geographical\r\ninvestigations. Then the Academy added its demands, making everything\r\ndoubly complicated. It demanded a scientific exploration of all\r\nSiberia and Kamchatka,--not only an account of these regions based\r\non astronomical determinations and geodetic surveys, on minute\r\ndescriptions and artistically executed landscape pictures, on\r\nbarometric, thermometric, and aerometric observations, as well as\r\ninvestigations in all the branches of natural history, but it demanded\r\nalso a detailed presentation of the ethnography, colonization,\r\nand history of the country, together with a multitude of special\r\ninvestigations in widely different directions. The leading spirits\r\nin these enterprises were two young and zealous Germans, the chemist\r\nJohann Georg Gmelin and the historian Gerhard Friedrich Müller,\r\ntwenty-eight and twenty-four years of age respectively, members of the\r\nAcademy, and later, highly respected scholars. Müller was a personal\r\nfriend of Bering, and through him got a desire to participate in the\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nKiriloff, the secretary of the Senate, himself a successful student of\r\ngeography, supported the efforts of the Academy, and most generously\r\ngratified all the exaggerated demands that only imperious and\r\ninexperienced devotees of science could present. Indeed, Bering could\r\nnot but finally consider himself fortunate in escaping a sub-expedition\r\nto Central Asia, one of Kiriloff's pet plans, which the latter\r\nafterwards took upon himself to carry out. The Academic branch of the\r\nexpedition, which thus came to consist of the astronomer La Croyère,\r\nthe physicist Gmelin (the elder), and the historian Müller, was right\r\nluxuriously equipped. It was accompanied by two landscape painters,\r\none surgeon, one interpreter, one instrument-maker, five surveyors,\r\nsix scientific assistants, and fourteen body-guards. Moreover, this\r\nconvoy grew like an avalanche, as it worked its way into Siberia. La\r\nCroyère had nine wagon-loads of instruments, among them telescopes\r\nthirteen and fifteen feet in length. These Academical gentlemen had\r\nat least thirty-six horses, and on the large rivers, they could\r\ndemand boats with cabins. They carried with them a library of several\r\nhundred volumes, not only of scientific and historical works in their\r\nspecialties, but also of the Latin classics and such light reading\r\nas Robinson Crusoe and Gulliver's Travels. Besides, they had seventy\r\nreams of writing paper and an enormous supply of artists' colors,\r\ndraughting materials and apparatus. All archives were to be open to\r\nthem, all Siberian government authorities were to be at their service\r\nand furnish interpreters, guides, and laborers. The Professors, as\r\nthey were called, constituted an itinerant academy. They drafted\r\ntheir own instructions, and no superior authority took upon itself to\r\nmake these subservient to the interests of the expedition as a whole.\r\nFrom February, 1734, they held one or two weekly meetings and passed\r\nindependent resolutions. It became a part of Bering's task to move\r\nthis cumbersome machine, this learned republic, from St. Petersburg\r\nto Kamchatka, to care for their comforts and conveniences, and render\r\npossible the flank movements and side sallies that either scientific\r\ndemands or their own freaks of will might dictate. In the original\r\ninstructions such directions were by no means few. But Bering had no\r\nauthority over these men. They were willing to recognize his authority\r\nonly when they needed his assistance. None of them except Bering and\r\nhis former associates had any idea of the mode and conditions of travel\r\nin that barbarous country. That there should be lack of understanding\r\nbetween men with such different objects in view as academists and\r\nnaval officers, is not very strange. Their only bond of union was the\r\nSenate's senseless ukase. If it had been the purpose of the government\r\nto exhibit a human parallel to the \"happy families\" of menageries, it\r\ncould hardly have acted differently. In all his movements Bering was\r\nhampered by this academical deadweight. The Professors not only showed\r\na lack of appreciation of Bering's efforts in their behalf, but they\r\nalso stormed him with complaints, filled their records with them, and\r\nconcluded them--characteristically enough--with a resolution to prefer\r\nformal charges against him before the Senate.\r\n\r\nOnly a new state, as the Russian then was, only a government that\r\nrecently had seen the will of one energetic man turn topsy-turvy a\r\nwhole people's mode of life, and yet had preserved a fanciful faith in\r\nPeter the Great's teachings--his supreme disregard for obstacles,--only\r\nsuch a government could even think of heaping such mountains of\r\nenterprises one upon the other, or demand that any one man, and a\r\nforeigner at that, should carry them into execution. Peter's spirit\r\nundoubtedly hovered over these plans, but the marble sarcophagus in the\r\nchurch of St. Peter and St. Paul had long since received his earthly\r\nremains, and without his personal energy the Senate's plans were but\r\nthe projects of a dazzled fancy. On paper the Senate might indeed refer\r\nBering to various ways and means; it might enjoin upon the Siberian\r\nauthorities to do everything in their power to promote the progress of\r\nthe various expeditions; it might direct its secretaries to prepare\r\na very humane declamation denouncing the practice of any violence\r\nagainst, or oppression of, the weak nomadic tribes in the East; but\r\nit could not by a few pen-strokes increase the natural resources of\r\nSiberia, or change the unwillingness of the local authorities to accede\r\nto the inordinate demands which the nautical expedition necessarily\r\nhad to make, nor could it make roads in the wild forest-regions where\r\nonly the Yakut and Tunguse roamed about. The Senate's humanitarian\r\nphrases were of but little significance to the explorers when it was\r\nfound necessary to compel the nomads of the East to supply what the\r\ngovernment had failed to furnish. The Senate had ventured so near the\r\nextreme limits of the possible, that it could not but end by crossing\r\nthe border and demanding the impossible. These numerous expeditions,\r\nscattered over half a continent, were exposed to so many unforeseeable\r\naccidents and misfortunes, that the government, in order to render\r\nsupport and retain its control, would necessarily have to be in regular\r\ncommunication. But east of Moscow there was no mail service. Hence the\r\ngovernment instructed Bering to establish, on consultation with the\r\nlocal authorities, postal communication, partly monthly and partly\r\nbi-monthly, from Moscow to Kamchatka, to the Chinese border by way of\r\nIrkutsk, and by a new route to Uda,--as though such a matter could\r\nbe accomplished through consultation. The Senate might have known,\r\nand in fact did know, that in the mountainous forest-region between\r\nYakutsk and Okhotsk (a distance of about seven hundred miles) there\r\nwas but one single Russian hut, and that all the requisites for a mail\r\nservice--men, horses, and roads--demanded unlimited means and most\r\nextensive preparations.\r\n\r\nA number of plans and propositions of minor importance are here\r\nomitted. The object has been to show, in a succinct review, the\r\norigin of the Great Northern Expedition, its enormous compass, and\r\nthe grouping of its various enterprises about Vitus Bering as its\r\nchief. Von Baer classes the tasks to be accomplished by Bering, each\r\nof which demanded separately equipped expeditions, under seven heads:\r\nnamely, astronomical observations and determinations in Siberia,\r\nphysico-geographical explorations, historic-ethnographical studies,\r\nthe charting of the Arctic coast, the navigation of the East Siberian\r\ncoast, and the discovery of Japan and America. This writer adds that\r\nno other geographical enterprise, not even the charting of China by\r\nthe Jesuits, Mackenzie's travels, or Franklin's expeditions, can in\r\ngreatness or sacrifice be compared with the gigantic undertakings that\r\nwere loaded upon Bering, and carried out by him.[51]\r\n\r\nIt would no doubt be wrong to ascribe the over-burdening of Bering's\r\nplans to any one man, and for a foreign author, who but imperfectly\r\nunderstands the Russian literature of that period, to do so, would be\r\nmore than foolish. Kiriloff, the secretary of the Senate, had great\r\nzeal for geographical explorations, and did all in his power to further\r\nthe plans of Czar Peter. It has been proved that Bering's proposition\r\nwas presented after a conference with Kiriloff, and that as long as\r\nhe lived, he assisted Bering by word and deed. Furthermore, it seems\r\nprobable that, in order to promote the exploration of Siberia, he\r\nprevented the Admiralty from sending Bering's expedition by sea south\r\nof Africa. However, it is undoubtedly a fact that Bering's plan reached\r\nits final proportions as a result of the discussions between Count\r\nOstermann, the influential courtier and statesman, (who evidently\r\nlanded in Russia in company with Bering in 1701), Soimonoff, an officer\r\nof the Senate, Kiriloff, and Golovin, chief of the Admiralty, and these\r\nmen would hardly have consulted the opinions of Bering, who often and\r\nmost emphatically disapproved of the additions that had been made to\r\nhis plans. Moreover, as a result of the distrust which his first\r\nexpedition inspired in Russia, he was in an insecure and unfortunate\r\nposition. But he had reason to complain of other things. The gigantic\r\ntask assigned to him demanded a despotic will endowed with dictatorial\r\npower. Bering lacked both, especially the latter.\r\n\r\nThe Senate exhausted itself in minute hints, directions, and\r\npropositions, instead of issuing definite orders concerning the\r\nnecessary means. Unfortunately, too, numerous and exaggerated\r\ncomplaints had been made in regard to the suffering which Bering's\r\nfirst expedition had caused the Kamchatkans, and on this account\r\nthe government was foolish enough to bind the chief's hands, while\r\nit simultaneously overloaded his shoulders. Through injudicious\r\ninstructions he was made dependent upon his subordinates. It was bad\r\nenough that he was not to be permitted to take any decisive steps in\r\nSiberia without first consulting and coming to an agreement with the\r\nlocal authorities,--the governor of Tobolsk, the lieutenant-governor of\r\nIrkutsk, and the voivode of Yakutsk. On account of the great distances\r\nand the wretched roads such proceedings were well-nigh impossible. The\r\ngovernment should have known that these authorities only under the\r\nmost peremptory orders would comply with demands liable to exhaust\r\nthe resources of the country and ruin the thinly-populated and\r\npoverty-stricken districts. This was, indeed, bad enough, but matters\r\nwere much aggravated when the Senate ordered him to take action in\r\nall important questions, only after deliberation with his officers,\r\nand to refer every loading measure to a commission. Such a method of\r\nprocedure seems to us entirely incomprehensible. But Sokoloff, who\r\nwas himself a Russian naval officer, says on this point, that the laws\r\nof the empire, which at that time were in full force, required of\r\nevery superior officer that he should consult his subordinates before\r\ninaugurating any new movement. In its instructions to Bering the Senate\r\nexpressly emphasized this decree of the law, and it actually went so\r\nfar as to order him, even in matters of comparative unimportance,\r\nto seek the opinion of his Academical associates, and always act\r\nin the strictest accordance with his Russian colleague Chirikoff's\r\npropositions.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs of the different branches of the expedition were of course\r\nsubject to the same regulation. In this way Bering was deprived of a\r\nsovereign chief's power and authority, and it afforded him but little\r\nreparation that the government gave him the power to reduce or promote\r\nan officer,--only naval officers, however. Necessary regard for the\r\nneeds of the service and for his own principles forbade him to use this\r\nweapon in that arbitrary manner which alone could have neutralized the\r\nunfortunate influence of the government laws. Hence this feature of his\r\ninstructions, besides causing much delay, became a source of the most\r\nincredible troubles and aggravations, which, as we shall see later,\r\nlaid him in his grave on the bleak coasts of Bering Island.\r\n\r\nEverything carefully considered, it could have surprised no one if\r\nthe Northern Expedition had collapsed in its very greatness, and it\r\nwas without any doubt due to Bering that this did not happen. In many\r\nrespects Bering was unqualified to lead such an expedition into a\r\nbarbarous country, surrounded as he was with incapable, uneducated, and\r\ncorruptible assistants, pestered by calumniators and secret or avowed\r\nenemies in every quarter, to whom the government seemed more disposed\r\nto listen than to him. More just than arbitrary, more considerate\r\nthan hasty, more humane than his position permitted, he nevertheless\r\nhad one important quality, an honest, genuine, and tenacious spirit\r\nof perseverance, and this saved the expedition from dissolution. The\r\ngovernment had sent him in pursuit of a golden chariot, and he found\r\nmore than the linchpin. The realization, however, was far from that\r\nanticipated by the government. Many of the projects of the original\r\nplan were but partially accomplished, and others were not even\r\nattempted; but in spite of this, the results attained by Bering and his\r\nassociates will stand as boundary-posts in the history of geographical\r\ndiscovery. Many of these men sealed their work with their lives, and\r\nadded a luster to the name of Russia,[52] which later explorers have\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[48] Note 39.\r\n\r\n[49] Note 40.\r\n\r\n[50] H.

It consisted of the chief Vitus Bering\r\n(his Russian name was Ivan Ivanovich Bering), Captains Spangberg and\r\nChirikoff, eight lieutenants, sixteen mates, twelve physicians, seven\r\npriests, skippers, stewards, various apprentices, ship-carpenters,\r\nother workmen, soldiers and sailors,--in all about five hundred\r\nand seventy men. Of these, three officers and one hundred and\r\nfifty-seven men--a number which was greatly increased in Siberia--were\r\nassigned duty in the Arctic expedition, the remainder in the Pacific\r\nexpeditions. In this estimate, the Academists, constituting an\r\nexpedition of thirty or forty men, are not considered. The list of\r\nnames of those engaged in these expeditions throws interesting light\r\non Russian social relations of that period. Over half of the officers,\r\nmany mates, and all of the physicians were foreigners. The Senate\r\nsought to inspire the zeal of the officers by large increase of salary\r\nand promotion in rank and service after a successfully completed\r\nexpedition, but the rank and file were to be forced to a performance\r\nof their duties by threats of cruel punishments and a continued\r\nstay in Siberia. It had been the intention to recruit the expedition\r\nthrough the voluntary service of Russians, but the native officers\r\nshowed but little inclination in this direction, and it was found\r\nnecessary to fill the vacancies by draft. Van Haven assures us that\r\nBering's expedition was looked upon in St. Petersburg as a mild sort of\r\nbanishment.\r\n\r\nThe necessary instruments and some provisions were obtained in\r\nSt. Petersburg. The naval officers were supplied with quadrants,\r\nthermometers, and nocturnals, the surveyors with astrolabes and\r\nGunter's-chains, and the Academists were authorized to take from the\r\nlibrary of the Academy all the works they needed, and, at the expense\r\nof the crown, to purchase such as the library did not contain. La\r\nCroyère carried with him a whole magazine of instruments. For presents\r\nto the natives two thousand rubles were appropriated. In N. Novgorod\r\nand Kazan some other necessaries were obtained, but the enormous\r\nship-supplies and provisions, besides men, horses, barges and other\r\nriver boats, were to be provided by the Siberian towns and country\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nThe Siberian authorities received orders to make great preparations.\r\nThey were to buy venison, fish, and cod liver oil, erect light-houses\r\nand magazines along the Arctic coast, and dispatch commissions with\r\nlarge transports to the Pacific coast, so as to enable Bering to begin\r\nhis work of discovery without delay. These preparations were to be\r\nfollowed by efforts toward the founding of various works, such as iron\r\nand salt works at Okhotsk, a smaller furnace at Yakutsk for the use\r\nof the expedition, and, through the utilization of the saccharine\r\nqualities of the \"bear's claw,\"[53] a distillery was also to be\r\nestablished on the peninsula of Kamchatka. It is unnecessary to say\r\nthat all of these propositions were buried in the Siberian government\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\nCalculations were made for a six years' expedition. The leaders of each\r\nbranch of the expedition were authorized to repeat any unsuccessful\r\nadventure the succeeding summer. All were prepared for a long stay in\r\nthe extreme northeast--many, indeed, remained there forever--hence,\r\nmost of the officers, among them Bering and Spangberg, were accompanied\r\nby their wives and children. On this account the expedition seemed more\r\nthan ever a national migration on a small scale.\r\n\r\nThe first start was made February 1, 1733. Spangberg, with some\r\nlaborers and the heaviest marine stores, went directly to Okhotsk to\r\nexpedite the ship-building on the Pacific coast. Lieutenant Ofzyn\r\nwent to Kazan to collect supplies. Bering started out March 18, in\r\norder as quickly as possible to reach Tobolsk, whence the first Arctic\r\nexpedition was to be sent out. In the course of the summer, the\r\nlarger caravans arrived at this place. Simultaneously heavy supplies\r\nwere brought in from West Siberia by Bering's men. Here, also, the\r\nconstruction of the vessel for the expedition, the shallop Tobol, was\r\nbegun. Only the Academists were yet in St. Petersburg, where they were\r\nreceiving the attention of the official world. At an audience, the\r\nEmpress bade them farewell in the most solemn manner. She allowed them\r\nto kiss her hand, and assured them of her most gracious favor. On the\r\nsucceeding day, the other members of the imperial family manifested\r\nsimilar sympathy. Then, however, the difficulties began. That these\r\nheavily-laden gentlemen could not even in St. Petersburg secure\r\nadequate means of transportation, makes quite a comical impression. On\r\nthis account they were detained until late in August, and they would no\r\ndoubt have been unable to reach Siberia in 1733, if Bering had not left\r\nfor them in Tver a conveniently equipped vessel, which carried them\r\nthe same autumn down the Volga to Kazan. They did not reach Tobolsk,\r\nhowever, until January, 1734. Bering, who was to be supplied by them\r\nwith surveyors and instruments for his Arctic expedition, and who could\r\nnot, before their arrival, form an estimate of the size of his river\r\ntransports to be used in the spring, was obliged repeatedly and very\r\nforcibly to urge them to make haste. Here the disagreements began,\r\nand were continued concerning petty affairs, which history finds it\r\nunnecessary to dwell upon.\r\n\r\nOn May 2, 1734, the Tobol was launched amid the firing of cannon, the\r\nblare of trumpets, and the merry draining of goblets. The vessel had\r\na keel of 70 feet, was 15 feet wide, and 7 feet deep. It carried two\r\nmasts, some small cannon, and a crew of 56 men, among them first mate\r\nSterlegoff and two cartographers, under the command of Lieut. Ofzyn. As\r\nthe provincial government had secured neither magazines nor provisions,\r\nnor attended to any other preparations on the Arctic coast, the\r\nnecessary supplies, which were to be stored north of Obdorsk, were\r\nloaded on four rafts, which, with a force of 30 men, accompanied Ofzyn.\r\nOn May 14, he received his Admiralty instructions from Bering, and,\r\nsaluted by cannon, the _First Arctic Expedition_ stood up the Irtish\r\nfor the Polar seas.\r\n\r\nFive days later, Bering, with the main command and the Academists, left\r\nTobolsk and took different routes for Yakutsk, which had been selected\r\nas the central point for the future enterprises of the expedition. In\r\nOctober, 1734, he arrived at this place, bringing with him a quantity\r\nof materials. The next spring, Chirikoff came with the greater part of\r\nthe supplies, and during the year following, this dull Siberian city\r\nwas the scene of no little activity. On his arrival, however, Bering\r\nfound that no preparations whatever had been made for him. In spite\r\nof instructions and orders from the government, nothing had been done\r\ntoward charting the Arctic coast or for the expediting of the heavily\r\nloaded transports on the way to Okhotsk. Nor did Bering find that the\r\nauthorities were even kindly disposed toward him. Yet, in the course\r\nof the next six months, he had two large ships built for the Arctic\r\nexpedition, and when his own supplies arrived by way of the central\r\nSiberian river-route, described in the first part of this work, these\r\nvessels, together with four barges, were equipped and furnished with\r\nprovisions, and in June, 1735, were ready for a start. These two\r\nships--the sloop Yakutsk, Lieut. Pronchisheff, first mate Chelyuskin,\r\nsurveyor Chekin, and about fifty men, and the decked boat Irkutsk,\r\nLieut. Peter Lassenius, with a surveyor, first mate, and also about\r\nfifty men--had most difficult tasks to accomplish. The former was to\r\ncruise from the mouth of the Lena, along the whole coast of the Taimyr\r\npeninsula, and enter the mouth of the Yenisei. The latter was to follow\r\nthe Arctic coast in an easterly direction to the Bering peninsula,\r\ncruise along its coast, and ascertain the relative positions of Asia\r\nand America, and, if it was a geographical possibility, to sail down\r\nto the peninsula of Kamchatka. He also had instructions to find the\r\nislands off the mouth of the Kolyma (the Bear Islands). From this it\r\nis evident that Lassenius's expedition was of the greater geographical\r\ninterest. Moreover, it had to do with one of the main questions of\r\nBering's whole activity--the discovery and charting of the North\r\nPacific--and hence it is not a mere accident that Bering selected for\r\nthis expedition one of his own countrymen, or that he assigned the\r\ncharting of northeastern Asia and the discovery of America and Japan,\r\nto chiefs of Danish birth, Lassenius and Spangberg. Nothing is known of\r\nthe earlier life of Lassenius. In service he was the oldest of Bering's\r\nlieutenants. Shortly before the departure of the expedition, he was\r\ntaken into the Russian fleet, and Gmelin says of him, that he was an\r\nable and experienced naval officer, volunteered his services to the\r\nexpedition, and began his work with intrepidity. All attempts to trace\r\nhis birth and family relations have proved fruitless.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of June, 1735, both expeditions left Yakutsk, and thus the\r\ncharting of the whole of the Arctic coast of Siberia was planned and\r\ninaugurated by Bering himself. He could now apply all his energies to\r\nthe Pacific expeditions. He constructed a multitude of river-craft,\r\nand erected barracks, magazines, winter-huts, and wharves along the\r\nriver-route to Okhotsk. In the vicinity of Yakutsk he established an\r\niron foundry and furnace, whence the various vessels were supplied\r\nwith anchors and other articles of iron. In fact, he made this place\r\nthe emporium for those heavy supplies that in the years 1735-36 were\r\nbrought from South and West Siberia, and which later were to be sent to\r\nOkhotsk.\r\n\r\nAt Okhotsk the exiled Major-General Pissarjeff was in command. He had\r\nbeen sent there as a government official, with authority on the Pacific\r\ncoast and in Kamchatka, to develop the country and pave the way for the\r\nexpeditions to follow, by making roads and harbors, erecting buildings\r\nin Okhotsk, introducing agriculture,--in fact, make this coast fit for\r\nhuman habitation. The government had given him ample power, but as he\r\naccomplished nothing, he was succeeded by Captain Pavlutski as chief\r\nin Kamchatka, and Pissarjeff was reduced to a sort of harbor-master in\r\nOkhotsk. A command that had been sent to his assistance under first\r\nmate Bireff, he nearly starved to death; the men deserted and the town\r\nremained the same rookery as ever.\r\n\r\nIn this condition Spangberg found affairs in the winter of 1734-35.\r\nWith his usual energy he had pushed his transports to Yakutsk in\r\nthe summer preceding, and with the same boats he proceeded up the\r\nAldan and Maya, but winter came on and his boats were frozen in on\r\nthe Yudoma. He started out on foot by the familiar route across the\r\nStanovoi Mountains to Okhotsk, which place he reached after enduring\r\ngreat hardship and suffering; but even here he found no roof for\r\nshelter. He was forced to subsist on carcasses and roots, and not\r\nuntil the spring fishing began and a provision caravan sent by Bering\r\narrived, did he escape this dire distress. In the early summer,\r\nPissarjeff put in an appearance, and very soon a bitter and fatal\r\nenmity arose between these two men.\r\n\r\nSpangberg was born in Jerne near Esbjerg in Jutland (Denmark), probably\r\nabout the year 1698. He was the son of well-to-do parents of the middle\r\nclass. In the Jerne churchyard there is still to be seen a beautiful\r\nmonument on the grave of his brother, the \"estimable and well-born\r\nChr. Spangberg,\" nothing else is known of his early life. In 1720, he\r\nentered the Russian fleet as a lieutenant of the fourth rank, and for\r\na time ran the packet-boat between Kronstadt and Lübeck, whereupon he\r\ntook part in Bering's first expedition as second in command. In 1732,\r\nfor meritorious service on this expedition, he was made a captain\r\nof the third rank. He was an able, shrewd, and energetic man, a\r\npractical seaman, active and vehement, inconsiderate of the feelings\r\nof others, tyrannical and avaricious. He spoke the Russian language\r\nonly imperfectly. His fame preceded him throughout all Siberia, and\r\nSokoloff says that many thought him some general, _incognito_, others\r\nan escaped convict. The natives of Siberia feared him and called him\r\nMartin Petrovich Kosar, or in ironical praise, \"Batushka\" (old fellow).\r\nHe had many enemies. Complaints and accusations were showered upon\r\nhim, but it would most certainly be wrong to ascribe to them any great\r\nsignificance. Siberia is the land of slander. All Russian officials\r\nwere corruptible, and the honest men among those who stood nearest to\r\nPeter himself could literally be counted on one's fingers. While in\r\nSiberia, Spangberg is said to have acquired the possession of many\r\nhorses, valuable furs, and other goods of which the authorities had\r\nforced the sale. When the Senate, after his great voyage of discovery\r\nto Japan, had treated him unjustly, he left Siberia arbitrarily in\r\n1745, and, without leave of absence, set out for St. Petersburg, where\r\nhe was summoned before a court-martial and condemned to death; but this\r\nwas finally commuted to his being reduced to a lieutenant for three\r\nmonths. He remained in the service and died, in 1761, as a captain of\r\nthe first rank. In Okhotsk he was accompanied by his wife and son.[54]\r\n\r\nBut his opponent was a still more remarkable man. Major-General\r\nPissarjeff had been a favorite of Peter the Great, director of the\r\nmilitary academy, and a high officer of the Senate. He had received\r\na careful education abroad, and moved in the very highest circles of\r\nsociety. In a quarrel with Vice-Chancellor Shafiroff, in 1722, however,\r\nhe had incurred Peter's wrath, whereupon he was for a time deprived\r\nof all official rank and banished to the Ladoga canal as overseer of\r\nthis great enterprise. Later he was pardoned, but when, in 1727, he\r\nconspired against Prince Menshikoff, he was deprived of everything,\r\nknouted, branded, and then exiled to Siberia as a colonist. After a\r\nseries of vicissitudes he appeared, in the capacity of harbor-master at\r\nOkhotsk, but the government gave him no rank; he was not even permitted\r\nto cover his brand. This old man, made vicious by a long and unjust\r\nbanishment, became Bering's evil spirit. In spite of his sixty or\r\nseventy years, he was as restless, fiery and vehement in both speech\r\nand action as when a youth, dissolute, corruptible, and slanderous--a\r\nfalse and malicious babbler, a full-fledged representative of the\r\nfamous Siberian \"school for scandal.\" For six long years he persecuted\r\nthe expedition with his hatred and falsehoods, and was several times\r\nwithin an ace of overthrowing everything. He lived in a stockaded fort\r\na few miles in the country, while Spangberg's quarters were down by\r\nthe sea, on the so-called Kushka, a strip of land in the Okhota delta,\r\nwhere the town was to be founded. The power of each was unrestrained.\r\nBoth were dare-devils who demanded an obedience which foretold the\r\nspeedy overthrow of each. Both sought to maintain their authority\r\nthrough imprisonment and corporal punishment. Thus they wrangled for\r\na year, Pissarjeff, meanwhile, sending numerous complaints to Yakutsk\r\nand St. Petersburg. But Spangberg was not to be trifled with. In the\r\nfall of 1736 he swore that he would effectually rid himself of \"the\r\nold scoundrel,\" who thereupon in all haste fled to Yakutsk, where he\r\narrived after a nine days' ride, and filled the town with his prattling\r\nfalsehoods, to which, however, only the Academists seem to have paid\r\nany attention.\r\n\r\nUnder circumstances where the local authorities did everything in their\r\npower to hinder the development of a district, it is only natural that\r\nin the settlement of Okhotsk and the construction of the ships for\r\nthe expedition but slow progress was made. The enormous stores which\r\nwere necessary for six or eight sea-going ships--provisions, cannon,\r\npowder, cables, hemp, canvas, etc., it would take two or three years\r\nto bring from Yakutsk, a distance both long and tedious, and fraught\r\nwith danger. The work, the superhuman efforts, the forethought, and\r\nperseverance that Bering and his men exhibited on these transporting\r\nexpeditions on the rivers of East Siberia have never been described or\r\nunderstood, and yet they perhaps form the climax in the events of this\r\nexpedition, every page of the history of which tells of suffering and\r\nthankless toil.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the 17th century, those Cossacks that conquered\r\nthe Amoor country had opened this river navigation, and now Bering\r\nre-opened it. The stores were transported down the Lena, up the Aldan,\r\nMaya, and Yudoma rivers, thence across the Stanovoi Mountains, down the\r\nUrak, and by sea to Okhotsk. These transportations at first employed\r\nfive hundred soldiers and exiles, and later more than a thousand. The\r\nseason is very short. The rivers break up in the early part of May,\r\nwhen the spring floods, full of devastating drift-ice, rise twenty or\r\nthirty feet above the average level and sweep along in their course\r\nwhole islands, thus filling the river-bed with trunks of trees and\r\nsand, deluging the wild rock-encircled valleys, so that navigation\r\ncan not begin until the latter part of May, again to be obstructed in\r\nAugust by ice. The course was against the current, so the crew had\r\nto walk along the rough and slippery banks and tug the flat-bottomed\r\nbarges up stream. In this way they were usually able, during the first\r\nsummer, to reach the junction of the Maya and the Aldan (Ust Maiskaya),\r\nwhere Bering built a pier and a number of magazines, barracks, and\r\nwinter-huts. Then the next summer, the journey would be continued\r\nup the Maya and into the Yudoma, which boils along through an open\r\nmountain valley over rocks, stones, and water-logged tree trunks. It\r\nhas but two or three feet of water, is full of sand-banks, with a\r\nwaterfall here and there and long rapids and eddies,--the so-called\r\n\"schiver.\" In such places the current was so strong that thirty men\r\nwere scarcely able to tug a boat against it. Standing in water to\r\ntheir waists, the men were, so to speak, obliged to carry the barges.\r\nThe water was very cauterizing, and covered their legs and feet with\r\nboils and sores. The oppressive heat of the day was followed by nights\r\nthat were biting cold, and when new ice was formed, their sufferings\r\nwere superhuman. In this manner Yudomskaya Krest (Yudoma's Cross) was\r\nreached in August of the second year. This place, where since the\r\ndays of the Cossack expedition a cross had stood, Bering made an\r\nintermediate station for the expedition. Here were the dwellings of two\r\nofficers, a barrack, two earth-huts, six warehouses, and a few other\r\nbuildings and winter-huts. In these warehouses the goods were stored,\r\nto be conveyed, in the following winter, on horseback across the\r\nStanovoi Mountains to the mountain stream Urak, which, after a course\r\nof two hundred versts, reaches the sea three miles south of Okhotsk.\r\n\r\nFor this part of the expedition, new winter-huts on the Stanovoi\r\nMountains, and magazines, river boats, and piers on the Urak had to be\r\nbuilt. This river is navigable only for a few days after the spring\r\nthaw. Then it boils along at the rate of six miles an hour, often\r\nmaking a trip down its course a dangerous one. Losseff says that in\r\nthis way, other things being favorable, Okhotsk was reached in three\r\nyears. The brief account which has here been attempted gives but a\r\nfaint idea of the labor, perseverance, and endurance requisite to make\r\none of these expeditions. Barges and boats had to be built at three\r\ndifferent places, roads had to be made along rivers, over mountains,\r\nand through forests, and piers, bridges, storehouses, winter-huts and\r\ndwellings had to be constructed at these various places. Not only\r\nthis. They suffered many misfortunes. Boats and barges were lost, men\r\nand beasts of burden were drowned, deserted, or were torn to pieces\r\nby wolves,--and all these difficulties Bering and his assistants\r\novercame through their own activity, without the support of the\r\nSiberian government, yes, in spite of its ill will, both concealed and\r\nmanifest. In 1737, he reported to the Admiralty: \"Prior to our arrival\r\nat Yakutsk not a pood[55] of provisions had been brought to Okhotsk\r\nfor us, nor had a single boat been built for the transportation. Nor\r\ndid we find workmen or magazines at the landing places on the Maya\r\nand Yudoma rivers. The Siberian authorities have not taken a single\r\nstep toward complying with the ukases issued by Her Royal Highness.\"\r\nAnd with justifiable self-esteem he adds: \"We did all this. We built\r\ntransports, we obtained workmen in Yakutsk, we conveyed our provisions\r\nto Yudomskaya Krest, and with superhuman efforts thence to the sea. At\r\nthe mouths of the Maya and Yudoma, at the Cross, and at the Urak we\r\nerected storehouses and dwellings, in the Stanovoi Mountains several\r\nwinter-huts, and on the Urak no less than seventy river boats, which\r\nhave, in part, started for Okhotsk with provisions. Not until after\r\nthe lapse of two years have I been able to induce the authorities in\r\nYakutsk to appoint superintendents of transportation, and for this\r\nreason it was entirely impossible for me to depart for Okhotsk, unless\r\nI wanted to see the work of the whole expedition come to a complete\r\nstandstill, bring upon my men the direst need, and force the whole\r\nenterprise into most ignominious ruin.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[53] Note 7.\r\n\r\n[54] Note 42.\r\n\r\n[55] A pood is thirty-six pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n  DELAY OF THE EXPEDITION CAUSED BY THE DEATH OF LASSENIUS AND HIS\r\n    COMMAND IN THE ARCTIC REGIONS.--DISSATISFACTION OF THE SENATE AND\r\n    ADMIRALTY WITH BERING'S WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difficulties recounted in the preceding chapter are alone\r\nsufficient to justify Bering's nearly three years' stay in Yakutsk; but\r\nsimultaneously many other duties demanded his attention. It does not\r\ncome within the scope of this treatise to describe the investigations\r\nof the Academical branch of this enterprise,--to portray Müller's\r\nand Gmelin's services to botany, history, and geography; they are of\r\ninterest here only in their relation to Bering. Especially in Yakutsk\r\ndid those men give him much to attend to. It devolved upon him now\r\nto convey those gentlemen, in a manner fitting their station, up or\r\ndown the Lena, now to send La Croyère to Lake Baikal or to the Arctic\r\nOcean,--all of which was to be done in a country principally inhabited\r\nby nomadic tribes, with only here and there a Russian population\r\nwhere there were government officials, and with no other means of\r\ntransportation than those secured for the occasion. In Yakutsk, where\r\nthe Professors stayed a long time, their relations with Bering were\r\nvery much strained, principally, it would seem, on account of their\r\nexorbitant demands for convenience and luxury. Since Bering would\r\nnot and could not take upon himself to transport them to Kamchatka\r\nas comfortably as he had thus far conveyed them, especially not from\r\nOkhotsk, in private and conveniently equipped vessels, and since the\r\nVoivode likewise gave them but little hope of support, both Gmelin and\r\nMüller made application for a release from the expedition, and left to\r\nKrasheninnikoff and Steller their principal task--the description of\r\nKamchatka.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1736, moreover, very discouraging news was received from\r\nthe Arctic seas. Pronchisheff had been obliged to go into winter\r\nquarters at Olenek, and Lassenius, who, August 2, had reached the rocky\r\nislet Stolb, in the Lena delta, and on the 7th stood out of the mouth\r\nof the Bykoff eastward, was driven by storm and ice into the river\r\nKhariulakh, east of the Borkhaya Bay, where he wintered, in a latitude\r\nof 71° 28'. The place was uninhabited, and he built from driftwood\r\na winter-house 66 feet long, making four apartments, with three\r\nfireplaces, and a separate kitchen and bath-room. As Lassenius hoped to\r\nbe able to continue the expedition during the two succeeding summers,\r\nthe rations were made considerably smaller.\r\n\r\nNovember 6, the polar night began, and shortly afterwards nearly the\r\nwhole crew were attacked by a deadly scurvy, so violent that perhaps\r\nonly Jens Munk[56] and his fellow-sufferers on the Churchill River have\r\nexperienced anything worse. On the 19th of December Lassenius died, and\r\nin the few succeeding months nearly all of his officers and thirty-one\r\nof the crew, so that when assistance from Bering arrived, only eight\r\nmen were alive. Müller and Gmelin say that the crew accused Lassenius\r\nof high treason, and mutinied; but there is no documentary evidence of\r\nthis. The report seems to have arisen through a confounding of the name\r\nof Lassenius with that of the deputy constable Rosselius, who, on the\r\n18th of November, 1735, was sent, under arrest, to Yakutsk. To fill\r\nthe vacancies caused by this terrible disease, Bering had to send a\r\nwhole new command--Lieut. Dmitri Laptjef, the second mate Plauting, and\r\nforty-three men--to Khariulakh to continue the expedition. In addition\r\nto this, two boats with provisions were sent to the mouth of the Lena,\r\nand in 1737, before he himself departed for Okhotsk, a shipload of\r\nprovisions was sent to supply the magazines on the Arctic coast. To\r\nthese various tasks Bering gave his personal attention.\r\n\r\nIn 1736-38 this great enterprise passed through a dangerous crisis.\r\nSeveral years had elapsed since the departure from St. Petersburg,\r\nthree hundred thousand rubles (over two hundred thousand dollars) had\r\nbeen expended--an enormous sum at that time--and yet Bering could\r\nnot point to a single result. Lassenius was dead, his successor, D.\r\nLaptjef, had been unfortunate, Pronchisheff had, in two summers of\r\ncruising, not been able to double the Taimyr peninsula, Ofzyn was\r\nstruggling in vain in the Gulf of Obi, while Bering and Spangberg had\r\nnot begun their Pacific expeditions. The former had not even reached\r\nthe coast. The government authorities at St. Petersburg were in the\r\nhighest degree dissatisfied with this seeming dilatoriness. The Senate\r\nsent a most earnest appeal to the Admiralty to recall the expedition.\r\nHere was a situation that Bering's enemies thought favorable for\r\ntheir intrigues. The departments of the Admiralty were deluged with\r\ncomplaints and accusations. The Siberian authorities, of whom Bering\r\nso justly had complained, answered with counter-charges. He was not\r\nfamiliar with the country, they said; he made unreasonable demands,\r\nand did not know how to avail himself of means at hand. Pissarjeff\r\ntold the government that Bering and Spangberg had undertaken this\r\nexpedition into Siberia simply to fill their own pockets,--that they\r\naccepted bribes, carried on a contraband liquor traffic, and had\r\nalready accumulated great wealth. The exiled naval officer, Kasanssoff,\r\nreported that there was entire lack of system in the enterprise; that\r\neverything was done at an enormous expenditure, and that nothing at\r\nall would be accomplished. Lieutenant Plauting, one of Bering's own\r\nofficers, who had been reduced for neglect of duty, accused Bering of\r\nbeing arbitrary, extravagant, and fond of show at the expense of the\r\ngovernment. He accused him, furthermore, of embezzlement on his first\r\nexpedition, in 1725, and alleged that Bering's wife had returned to\r\nRussia with a fortune, and had in Yakutsk abducted two young women.[57]\r\n\r\nHistory has not confirmed a single one of these charges. As for\r\nsacrifice, disinterestedness, and zeal, Bering not only rises far\r\nabove his surroundings--which is, perhaps, not saying very much--but\r\nhis character is clean and unsullied. Even so petty a person as\r\nSokoloff, who, in other respects, does not spare him, has for his\r\ncharacter unqualified praise. Nevertheless, all of these complaints\r\nand accusations caused Bering much trouble and vexation. The Admiralty,\r\nhard pressed by the Senate, found it difficult to furnish the\r\nnecessary means for the continuation of the expedition, and treated\r\nBering severely and unreasonably. It lacked the view which personal\r\nexamination gives. It was beset with deceitfulness and circumvention,\r\nand its experiences led it to take the worst for granted. Hence, it\r\nsent Bering one message after the other reprehensive of his course.\r\nIt threatened to fine him, to court-martial him, to reduce him, and,\r\nin 1737, it even went so far as to deprive him of his supplemental\r\nsalary, which was withheld several years.[58] Bering defended himself\r\nwith the bitterness of despair. In his reports he gave the most solemn\r\nassurances of his perseverance and fidelity to duty, and the most\r\ndetailed accounts of all difficulties. He declared upon his honor that\r\nhe was unable to see any other means or resources than those he had\r\nresorted to. He even appealed at last to the testimony of the chiefs of\r\nthe various expeditions and all the subordinate officers. He was not\r\nbelieved. The Admiralty showed its lack of tact by letting Chirikoff\r\ninvestigate a series of charges against him. Furthermore, in spite of\r\nBering's most urgent representations, Pissarjeff continued to retain\r\nhis position in Okhotsk; and, although the government threatened the\r\nSiberian authorities with the sternest punishments, still the latter\r\nonly very inactively participated in the work of the expedition.\r\n\r\nSokoloff gives a very repulsive picture of Bering's assistants. On\r\naccount of the discomforts of the journey in this barbaric country,\r\nand under the pressure of ceaseless toil, a large number of the\r\nsubordinates fell to drinking and committing petty thefts; and the\r\nofficers, gathered as they were from all quarters of the world, are\r\ndescribed as a band of gruff and unruly brawlers. They were always at\r\nsword's points. Pronchisheff and Lassenius, Chirikoff and Spangberg,\r\nthe latter and Walton, Plauting, Waxel, Petroff and Endoguroff,\r\nwere constantly wrangling, and at times most shameful scenes were\r\nenacted. Our Russian author is not adverse to giving Bering the\r\nprincipal blame for these dissensions which cast a gloom on this\r\nworthy undertaking and impaired the forces of the expedition. He\r\nrepeatedly, and with much force, accuses him of being weak, and in\r\nthe Imperial Marine this opinion seems yet to prevail.[59] Sokoloff\r\nsays: \"Bering was a well-informed man, eager for knowledge, pious,\r\nkind-hearted, and honest, but altogether too cautious and indecisive;\r\nzealous, persevering, and yet not sufficiently energetic; well liked\r\nby his subordinates, yet without sufficient influence over them,--too\r\nmuch inclined to allow himself to be affected by their opinions and\r\ndesires, and not able to maintain strict discipline. Hence, he was not\r\nparticularly well qualified to lead this great enterprise, especially\r\nin such a dark century and in such a barbaric country as East Siberia.\"\r\nI do not doubt that we here find some of the elements of Bering's\r\ncharacter, but Sokoloff was much more of an archivist than historian\r\nand student of human nature. In his long accounts he never succeeds, by\r\nmeans of describing any action or situation, in giving a psychological\r\ninsight into Bering's character, and, as matters now stand, it is\r\nimpossible to draw any tenable line between the errors and delays that\r\nwere necessarily attendant upon such an over-burdened enterprise, and\r\nthose that were due to the possible inefficiency of the leader. By the\r\nauthority of the Senate the expedition was not a monarchical unit under\r\nBering, but a democratic association under an administrative chief. It\r\nis not difficult to collect from the literature of that day a series of\r\nexpressions which accuse Bering of cruelty, imperiousness, and military\r\narrogance. Of a hundred leaders in Bering's position ninety-nine would\r\nundoubtedly have thought it wise to leave the whole expedition. Steller\r\nhas with far more delicacy and skill drawn the main lines of his mental\r\nphysiognomy. \"Bering was,\" he says, \"a true and honest Christian,\r\nnoble, kind, and unassuming in conduct, universally loved by his\r\nsubordinates, high as well as low. Every reasonable person must admit\r\nthat he always sought to perform the work entrusted to him to the best\r\nof his ability, although he himself confessed and often regretted that\r\nhis strength was no longer sufficient for so difficult an expedition.\r\nHe deplored the fact that the plans for the expedition had been made\r\non a much larger and more extensive scale than he had proposed, and he\r\nexpressed a desire that, on account of his age, he might be released\r\nfrom this duty and have the task assigned to some young and active\r\nRussian. As is well known, he was not naturally a man of quick resolve,\r\nbut when one considers his fidelity to duty, his cheerful spirit\r\nof perseverance and careful deliberation, it is a question whether\r\nanother, possessed of more fire and ardor, could have overcome the\r\ninnumerable difficulties of the expedition without having completely\r\nruined those distant regions; for even Bering, far removed from all\r\nselfishness, was scarcely able in this regard to keep his men in check.\r\nThe only fault of which the brave man can be accused, is that his\r\ntoo great leniency was as detrimental as the spirited and oftentimes\r\ninconsiderate conduct of his subordinates.\" It is undoubtedly true that\r\nBering was not fully equal to the task; but no one would have been\r\nequal to this task. It is possible that his humane conduct impaired\r\nthe work of the expedition, but this allegation still lacks proof, and\r\nSokoloff, who wrote his book as a vindication of Chirikoff against Von\r\nBaer's sympathetic view of Bering, must be read with this reservation.\r\nIt is downright absurd to hold the leader responsible for the moral\r\nweaknesses of his officers, for he had not chosen them, and was as\r\ndependent upon them as they upon him. \"It seems to me,\" says Von Baer,\r\n\"that Bering has everywhere acted with the greatest circumspection and\r\nenergy, and also with the greatest forbearance. The whole expedition\r\nwas planned on such a monstrous scale that under many another chief it\r\nwould have foundered without having accomplished any results whatever.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[56] Munk was sent out by the Danish government in 1619 to search for a\r\nNorthwest passage.--TR.\r\n\r\n[57] Note 43.\r\n\r\n[58] Note 44.\r\n\r\n[59] Note 45.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n  FINAL PREPARATIONS FOR THE PACIFIC EXPEDITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1737, Bering changed his headquarters to Okhotsk, and\r\nin the course of the autumn and winter, the greater part of his force\r\nwas transferred to the same place or distributed among the various\r\nintermediate stations on the Yudoma, Maya, and Urak. Spangberg and\r\nBering built Okhotsk. At the junction of the Okhota and the Kukhta, on\r\none of the narrow deltas, the so-called Kushka, they erected a church\r\nfor the expedition, a number of houses for the officers, barracks,\r\nmagazines, a large dock-yard, and other buildings. The old stockaded\r\nfort, four miles farther up in the country, was deserted. Around the\r\nmilitary center of the expedition the town gradually formed and rapidly\r\ngrew to become the Russian metropolis on the Pacific. It cost very\r\ngreat exertions to make the place inhabitable. The site was a long\r\nsand-bank deposit, threatened by inundations. The climate was very\r\nunhealthy,--a cold, raw fog almost continually hung over this region.\r\nThe party was pestered with fevers, and in this swamp it was that\r\nBering lost his health. \"The place is new and desolate,\" he writes.\r\n\"We have sand and pebbles, no vegetation whatever, and no timber in\r\nthe vicinity. Firewood must be obtained at a distance of four to five\r\nmiles, drinking water one to two miles, while timber and joints for\r\nship-building must be floated down the river twenty-five miles.\" But\r\nas a place for a dock-yard, as a harbor and haven of refuge for large\r\nships, the location had such great advantages that these difficulties\r\nhad to be overcome.\r\n\r\nSpangberg's work had made the place. His men had worked clay, made\r\ntiles, and built houses, and when Bering arrived the ships Archangel\r\nMichael and Hope lay fully equipped in the harbor. Bering's old ships\r\nFortuna and Gabriel had been repaired, and Spangberg lacked only an\r\nadequate supply of provisions to begin his expedition to Japan in the\r\nautumn of 1737.\r\n\r\nBut the provision transports, as usual, moved on very slowly and\r\nwith great difficulty. In Okhotsk Spangberg's men were constantly in\r\ndistress. They received only the rations of flour and rice authorized\r\nby law, and at long intervals some beef which Bering had bought in\r\nYakutsk. On account of this scarcity of provisions Spangberg was\r\nobliged partially to stop work on the vessels. A part of his force was\r\npermitted to go a-fishing, a part were sent to the magazines in the\r\ncountry for their maintenance, while others were detached to assist\r\nin the work of transportation; hence it was with only a small force\r\nthat he could continue work on the ships for the American voyage, the\r\npacket-boats St. Peter and St. Paul.\r\n\r\nSokoloff says: \"Bering stayed three years in Okhotsk, exerting himself\r\nto the utmost in equipping expeditions, enduring continual vexations\r\nfrom the Siberian government--especially on account of Pissarjeff--and\r\nconducting frequent examinations and investigations into the quarrels\r\nand complaints of his subordinates. During all this time he was sternly\r\nand unreasonably treated by the Admiralty, which showered upon him\r\nthreats and reproaches for slowness sluggishness, and disorder, for\r\nfalse reports and ill-timed accounts.\" Even as late as 1740 the Senate\r\nmade a proposition to discontinue the expedition, and only by calling\r\nattention to the enormous expenditures already made, which would in\r\nthat case be completely wasted, was the Admiralty allowed to continue\r\nit. Bering was especially disheartened on account of Pissarjeff. The\r\nlatter arrived at Okhotsk at the same time that Bering did, took up\r\nhis abode in the old Ostrog (fort) and immediately began his malicious\r\nannoyances. His complaints and protests poured into headquarters at\r\nOkhotsk. \"For a correspondence with him alone,\" writes Bering, \"I might\r\nuse three good secretaries. I find his foul-tongued criticism extremely\r\noffensive.\" He would capture Bering's men to give them a drubbing,\r\nwhile his own deserted him to join Bering, by whom they were kindly\r\nreceived. The new town and the Ostrog were two hostile camps. Finally\r\nBering was compelled to make a sally to liberate his men. The intrepid\r\nSpangberg, entirely out of patience with Bering's leniency, said: \"Why\r\ndo you give yourself so much trouble about this old knave? Give me four\r\nmen and the authority and I shall immediately put him under arrest.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1738, Spangberg found it possible to depart for Japan, and\r\nin two summer expeditions he charted the Kurile Islands, Yezo, and a\r\npart of the eastern coast of Nipon (Hondo), whereupon the cartography\r\nof this part of the globe assumed an entirely new appearance.\r\n\r\nThe expeditions to Japan, which employed four ships and several hundred\r\nmen, had exhausted the provisions in Okhotsk. It was again necessary\r\nto raise large supplies in West Siberia. A demand was made upon the\r\ngovernment office in Tobolsk for 40,000 rubles. From the district of\r\nVerkhoiansk 50,000 poods of provisions, while in part from West Siberia\r\nand in part from the Admiralty 20,000 yards of cloth were received.\r\nFrom other very distant places oil, hemp, and other necessaries were\r\nobtained. The Admiralty despatched to Irkutsk and Yakutsk two naval\r\nofficers, Lieutenants Tolbukhin and Larionoff, to superintend the\r\ntransportation of these goods. The number of laborers was increased to\r\na thousand, the roads were improved, more attendants were provided, the\r\nSiberian authorities exhibited more energy than before, new river-boats\r\nwere constructed, and pack-horses were collected from a large radius\r\nof country; by these increased means it was possible to collect all\r\nnecessaries in Okhotsk by 1740. In the month of June the ships for the\r\nAmerican expedition, the St. Peter and the St. Paul, were launched.\r\nThey were two-masters, 80 feet long, 22 feet wide, and 9-1/2 feet deep,\r\nrigged as brigs, each of 108 tons burden, carrying 14 two and three\r\npound guns.\r\n\r\nIn the harbor and on the Sea of Okhotsk there was now quite a\r\nrespectable fleet of eight or nine ships, all built by Bering. The\r\nArctic coasts had been charted through his efforts. Spangberg had with\r\ngreat success completed his task, and had been sent by Bering to St.\r\nPetersburg to render a report. Bering's own force, which consisted\r\nof 166 men, besides 80 engaged in transporting, was now collected in\r\nOkhotsk. The astronomical department under La Croyère and the scientist\r\nSteller also arrived, and finally Bering had the satisfaction of seeing\r\nhis worst enemy removed. In August, 1740, Pissarjeff was discharged,\r\nand poor Antoni Devier, first a cabin boy, then successively\r\naid-de-camp, general, and chief of police in St. Petersburg--one of\r\nPeter the Great's most trusted companions in arms, but banished through\r\nthe hatred of Menshikoff--became his successor as harbor-master in\r\nOkhotsk.[60]\r\n\r\nIn the middle of August the packet-boats, the galley Okhotsk, and\r\na double sloop containing the scientists were ready to sail for\r\nKamchatka. Then Spangberg quite unexpectedly arrived. On his way home\r\nhe had received a counter order. The authorities in St. Petersburg\r\ncommanded him to repeat the expedition to Japan. This gave Bering\r\nsome extra work in the way of letters and orders, so that the vessels\r\nunder Bering's and Chirikoff's commands did not leave port until\r\nthe 8th of September. They were supplied with provisions for twenty\r\nmonths, and their temporary destination was Avacha Bay on the east\r\ncoast of Kamchatka, where they were to pass the winter. All the great\r\nenterprises which the government had instructed Bering to undertake\r\nhad now been begun. In the following chapters will be found a succinct\r\naccount of the results of each.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[60] Note 46.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nTHE VARIOUS EXPEDITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n  THE ARCTIC EXPEDITIONS.--THE NORTHEAST PASSAGE.--SEVERE CRITICISMS ON\r\n    NORDENSKJÖLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Arctic expeditions made during the period from 1734 to 1743 have\r\nonly in part any connection with the object of this work. These\r\nexpeditions were, it is true, planned by Bering, and it was due to\r\nhis activity and perseverance that they were undertaken. He secured\r\nvessels, men, and means, and had charge of the first unsuccessful\r\nattempt; he was responsible to the government, and in his zeal went\r\njust as far as his instructions would allow him. But his own special\r\ntask soon taxed his time too heavily to permit him to assume charge of\r\nthe Arctic expeditions. They were not carried out until several years\r\nafter his departure from Yakutsk,--after he had ceased to be their\r\nleader. We have already shown Bering's important relation to them,\r\nsomething which has never before been done in West European literature.\r\nHence our object, namely, to give Bering his dues, may therefore best\r\nbe accomplished by giving a short account of the results achieved by\r\nthese expeditions.\r\n\r\nThe world has never witnessed a more heroic geographical\r\nenterprise than these Arctic expeditions. In five or six different\r\ndirections--from the Petchora, the Obi, the Yenesei, and the Lena--the\r\nunknown coasts of the Old World were attacked.[61] For a whole decade\r\nthese discoverers struggled with all the obstacles which a terrible\r\nclimate and the resources of a half developed country obliged them\r\nto contend with. They surmounted these obstacles. The expeditions\r\nwere renewed, two, three, yes, even four times. If the vessels were\r\nfrozen in, they were hauled upon shore the next spring, repaired, and\r\nthe expedition continued. And if these intrepid fellows were checked\r\nin their course by masses of impenetrable ice, they continued their\r\nexplorations on dog sledges, which here for the first time were\r\nemployed in Arctic exploration. Cold, scurvy, and every degree of\r\ndiscomfort wrought sad havoc among them, but many survived the long\r\npolar winter in miserable wooden huts or barracks. Nowhere has Russian\r\nhardiness erected for itself a more enduring monument.\r\n\r\nIt was especially the projecting points and peninsulas in this region\r\nthat caused these explorers innumerable difficulties. These points\r\nand capes had hitherto been unknown. The crude maps of this period\r\nrepresented the Arctic coast of Siberia as almost a straight line. It\r\nwas first necessary for the navigators to send cartographers to these\r\nregions, build beacons and sea-marks, establish magazines, collect\r\nherds of reindeer, which, partly as an itinerant food supply, and\r\npartly to be used as an eventual means of conveyance, followed along\r\nthe coast with the vessels, while here and there, especially on the\r\nTaimyr peninsula, small fishing stations were established for supplying\r\nthe vessels.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1737 Malygin and Skuratoff crossed the Kara Sea and\r\nsailed up the Gulf of Obi. In the same year the able Ofzyn charted the\r\ncoast between the Obi and the Yenesei, but was reduced to the rank of\r\na common sailor, because in Berezov he had sought the company of the\r\nexiled Prince Dolgoruki.\r\n\r\nIn the year previous, Pronchisheff all but succeeded in doubling the\r\nTaimyr peninsula, and reached the highest latitude (77° 29') that\r\nhad been reached by water before the Vega expedition. But it was\r\nespecially in the second attempt, from 1738 to 1743, that the greatest\r\nresults were attained. The two cousins, Chariton and Dmitri Laptjef,\r\nwho were equipped anew and vested with great authority, attacked the\r\ntask of doubling the Taimyr and Bering peninsulas with renewed vigor.\r\nBy extensive sledging expeditions, the former linked his explorations\r\nto those undertaken by Minin and Sterlegoff from the west, and his\r\nmate, Chelyuskin, in 1742, planted his feet on the Old World's most\r\nnortherly point, and thus relegated the story of a certain Jelmerland,\r\nsaid to connect northern Asia with Novaia Zemlia, to that lumber-room\r\nwhich contains so many ingenious cartographical ideas. But even these\r\ncontributions to science were, perhaps, surpassed by those of Dmitri\r\nLaptjef. As Lassenius's successor he charted, in three summers, the\r\nSiberian coast from the Lena to the great Baranoff Cliff, a distance of\r\nthirty-seven degrees. On this coast, toward the last, he found himself\r\nin a narrow strait, from ten to twenty yards wide, and he did not stop\r\nuntil there was scarcely a bucketful of water between the polar ice and\r\nthe rocky shore. But Cape Schelagskii, on the northeast coast, where\r\nDeshneff a century before had shown the way, he did not succeed in\r\ndoubling.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the labors of this great Northern Expedition,\r\nthe northern coast of the Old World got substantially the same\r\ncartographical outline that it now has. The determinations of latitude\r\nmade by the Russian officers were very accurate, but those of\r\nlongitude, based on nautical calculations, were not so satisfactory.\r\nTheir successors, Wrangell, Anjou, Middendorff, and even Nordenskjöld,\r\nhave therefore found opportunity to make corrections of but minor\r\nimportance, especially in regard to longitude.\r\n\r\nBut it is necessary to dwell a little longer on these expeditions.\r\nTheir principal object was not so much the charting of northern Siberia\r\nas the discovery and navigation of the Northeast passage. From this\r\npoint of view alone they must be considered. This is the connecting\r\nthought, the central point in these scattered labors. They were an\r\nindirect continuation of the West European expeditions for the same\r\npurpose, but far more rational than these. For this reason Bering\r\nhad, on his expedition of reconnoissance (1725-30), first sought that\r\nthoroughfare between the two hemispheres without which a Northeast and\r\na Northwest passage could not exist. For this reason also he had, on\r\nhis far-sighted plan, undertaken the navigation of the Arctic seas,\r\nwhere this had not already been done by Deshneff, and for this same\r\nreason the Admiralty sought carefully to link their explorations to the\r\nWest European termini, on the coast of Novaia Zemlia as well as Japan.\r\nMoreover, the discovery of a Northeast passage was the _raison d'être_\r\nof these expeditions.\r\n\r\nThis alone promised the empire such commercial and political advantages\r\nthat the enormous expenditures and the frightful hardships which these\r\nexpeditions caused Siberia, might be justified. For this reason the\r\ngovernment, summer after summer, drove its sailors on along the Taimyr\r\nand Bering peninsulas; for this reason, in 1740, it enjoined upon D.\r\nLaptjef to make a last attempt to double northeast Asia from Kamchatka,\r\nand this would undoubtedly have been accomplished if the unfortunate\r\ndeath of Bering had not occurred shortly after;[62] and for this\r\nreason, also, the government caused the charting of the coast by land\r\nafter all nautical attempts had miscarried.\r\n\r\nAny extended documentary proof of the correctness of this view must be\r\nconsidered unnecessary. The instructions expressly state the object\r\nof the expedition: to ascertain with certainty whether vessels could\r\nfind a passage or not. Müller says the same. Scholars like Middendorff,\r\nVon Baer, and Dr. Petermann look upon these expeditions from the same\r\nstandpoint, and have seen fit to give them the place of honor among all\r\nthe geographical efforts in the Northeast passage.[63] Some Swedish\r\nscholars alone have found it necessary to maintain a different view.\r\nDr. A. Stuxberg and Prof. Th.\r\n\r\nM. Fries in Upsala have published accounts of the history of the\r\nNortheast passage, in which not a word about these expeditions is\r\nfound. Between the days of Vlaming and Cook, from 1688 until 1778, they\r\nfind nothing to be said of explorations in this part of the world, and\r\nthe charting of these waters does not, in their opinion, seem to have\r\nany connection with the history of the Northeast passage. Prof. Fries\r\nattempts to justify this strange method of treatment by the assertion\r\nthat those expeditions did not seek the navigation of the Northeast\r\npassage, and did not undertake to sail a ship from the Atlantic to the\r\nPacific. But what authority, what historical foundation, have such\r\nassertions? Simply because the Russians parceled out this work and\r\nwent at it in a sensible manner; because they did not loudly proclaim\r\ntheir intention to sail directly from the Dwina to Japan; because\r\nthey had been instructed by the visionary and fatal attempts of West\r\nEurope,--yes, one is almost tempted to say, just because those Russian\r\nexpeditions alone are of any importance in the early history of the\r\npassage, the Swedish historians pass them by; Prof. Fries has even\r\nventured the assertion that the discovery of the Northeast passage by\r\nthese Russian expeditions, one hundred and thirty-seven years before\r\nNordenskjöld, is a discovery hitherto unsurmised by anyone but the\r\nauthor of this work. I am not disposed to wrangle about words, and\r\nstill less to interfere with anyone's well-earned privileges. By\r\nthe discovery of the Northeast passage, I understand that work of\r\ngeographical exploration, that determination of the distribution of\r\nland and water along the northern boundary of the Old World, that\r\ntraversing and charting of the coast which showed the existence of the\r\npassage, but not the nautical utilization of it. This is the European\r\ninterpretation of this question. In any other sense McClure did not\r\ndiscover the Northwest passage. If it is permissible to speak of the\r\ndiscovery of the Northeast passage after the time of Bering and the\r\nGreat Northern Expedition, it is equally permissible to speak of the\r\ndiscovery of the Northwest passage after the time of the great English\r\nexpeditions. If some future Nordenskjöld should take it into his head\r\nto choose these waters as the scene of some great nautical achievement,\r\nMcClure, according to Prof. Fries's historical maxims, could not even\r\nfind a place in the history of this passage, for it was not his object\r\nto sail a ship around the north of the New World. I very much doubt,\r\nhowever, that the Professor would in such a case have the courage to\r\napply his maxims.\r\n\r\nNor does Baron Nordenskjöld concede to the Great Northern Expedition\r\na place in the history of the Northeast passage. The \"Voyage of the\r\nVega\" is an imposing work, and was written for a large public, but\r\neven the author of this work has not been able to rise to an unbiased\r\nand just estimate of his most important predecessors. His presentation\r\nof the subject of Russian explorations in the Arctic regions, not\r\nalone Bering's work and that of the Great Northern Expedition, but\r\nalso Wrangell's, Lütke's, and Von Baer's, is unfair, unsatisfactory,\r\ninaccurate, and hence misleading in many respects. Nordenskjöld's book\r\ncomes with such overpowering authority, and has had such a large\r\ncirculation, that it is one's plain duty to point out palpable errors.\r\nNordenskjöld is not very familiar with the literature relating to\r\nthis subject. He does not know Berch's, Stuckenberg's, or Sokoloff's\r\nworks. Middendorff's and Von Baer's clever treatises he uses only\r\nincidentally. He has restricted himself to making extracts from\r\nWrangell's account, which in many respects is more than incomplete,\r\nand does not put these expeditions in the right light. It is now a\r\ncouple of generations since Wrangell's work was written, which is more\r\na general survey than an historical presentation. While Nordenskjöld\r\ndevotes page after page to an Othere's, an Ivanoff's, and a Martinier's\r\nvery indifferent or wholly imaginary voyages around northern Norway,\r\nhe disposes of the Great Northern Expedition, without whose labors\r\nthe voyage of the Vega would have been utterly impossible, in five\r\nunhappily written pages. One seeks in vain in his work for the\r\nprincipal object of the Northern Expedition,--for the leading idea that\r\nmade these magnificent enterprises an organic whole, or for a full and\r\njust recognition of these able, and, in some respects, unfortunate\r\nmen, whose labors have so long remained without due appreciation. In\r\nspite of Middendorff's interesting account of the cartography of the\r\nTaimyr peninsula, Nordenskjöld does not make the slightest attempt\r\nto explain whether his corrections of the cartography of this region\r\nare corrections of the work of Laptjef and Chelyuskin, or of the\r\nmisrepresentations of their work made by a later age.\r\n\r\nAbout the charting of Cape Chelyuskin he says: \"This was done by\r\nChelyuskin in 1742 on a new sledging expedition, the details of which\r\nare but little known; evidently because until the most recent times\r\nthere has been a doubt in regard to Chelyuskin's statement that he had\r\nreached the most northerly point of Asia. After the voyage of the Vega,\r\nhowever, there can no longer be any doubt.\"[64]\r\n\r\nThe truth is, ever since 1843,[65] when Middendorff published the\r\npreliminary account of his expedition to the Taimyr peninsula, no doubt\r\nhas prevailed that all who are familiar with Russian literature, or\r\neven with German literature, on this subject, have long since been\r\nconvinced of the fact that the most northern point of Asia was visited\r\nand charted a century and a half ago,--that the details of Chelyuskin's\r\nexpedition, so far from being unknown, are those parts of the work of\r\nthe Northern Expedition which have been most thoroughly investigated\r\nand most often presented. Nordenskjöld's recognition of Chelyuskin's\r\nwork comes thirty-eight years too late; it has already been treated\r\nwith quite a different degree of thoroughness than by the few words\r\nexpended on it in the \"Voyage of the Vega.\" In 1841, Von Baer accused\r\nChelyuskin of having dishonestly given the latitude of the most\r\nnortherly point of Asia, and these charges Nordenskjöld prints as late\r\nas 1881 without any comment whatever. If he had only seen Von Baer's\r\nmagazine for 1845[66] he would there have found the most unreserved\r\nretraction of them and most complete restitution to Chelyuskin on\r\nthe part of Von Baer, and would thus have escaped ascribing to a man\r\nopinions which he renounced a generation ago. Middendorff is likewise\r\nvery painstaking in presenting the history of these measurements,\r\nand is open and frank in his praise. He says: \"In the spring of 1742\r\nChelyuskin crowned his work by sailing from the Khatanga River around\r\nthe eastern Taimyr peninsula and also around the most northerly point\r\nof Asia. He is the only one who a century ago had succeeded in reaching\r\nand doubling this promontory. The fact that among many he alone was\r\nsuccessful in this enterprise, must be attributed to his great ability.\r\nOn account of his perseverance, as well as his careful and exact\r\nmeasurements, he stands preëminent among seamen who have labored in\r\nthe Taimyr country.\" And furthermore, in 1785, Sokoloff published a\r\nvery careful and extensive account of these labors, together with an\r\nextract from Chelyuskin's diary relating to the charting of the Taimyr\r\npeninsula, which later was published in German by Dr. Petermann.[67]\r\nThe difference in latitude of the northern point of the Taimyr\r\npeninsula as determined by Chelyuskin and by Nordenskjöld is scarcely\r\nthree minutes.[68]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[61] Middendorff gives the following interesting outline of these\r\nexpeditions:\r\n\r\n  From Petchora to the Obi:                    From the Obi:\r\n                                          -----------------------\r\n  Muravjoff and Pavloff.

But\r\nI had certainly the right to say this. If a person in 1742 performed\r\none of the heroic deeds of geography without having received any\r\nacknowledgment for it in his lifetime, and if the best authorities\r\nin this person's own country a century later still considered him an\r\nimpostor, I was surely justified in giving the above-quoted opinion in\r\n1880, in spite of the fact that two eminent geographical authorities\r\nhave withdrawn their charges. Moreover, is it really the case that\r\nSokoloff's and Von Baer's later writings made it impossible to revive\r\nthe old charge? He who can assert this must be but slightly acquainted\r\nwith the history of geography, and with that of Siberian geography\r\nabove all.\" In a note Nordenskjöld adds: \"Previous to the departure of\r\nthe Vega from Sweden, I received a letter from an unknown well-wisher\r\nto our voyage, cautioning me not to put too much faith in the\r\nChelyuskin exploration story, as the writer of the letter considered\r\nit fictitious.\" To the Baron's criticism I shall simply remark: I\r\nhave shown in the text that when he wrote the \"Voyage of the Vega\"\r\nhe was not familiar with the latest works on this question. Hence he\r\nhas been entirely unable to decide whether the old doubts concerning\r\nChelyuskin's results could be revived or not. I appeal to all students\r\nof these finer points in the history of geography, who will certainly\r\nagree with my statement that the Baron in this question has absolutely\r\nno other support than that of an anonymous letter!--_Author's Note to\r\nAmerican Edition._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n  THE DISCOVERY OF THE KURILE ISLANDS AND JAPAN FROM THE NORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe men that took part in these early Russian explorations have\r\nnot yet received their just dues. Not one of them, however, needs\r\nrehabilitation so much as Spangberg. He is entitled to an independent\r\nplace in geographical history, but has been completely barred out. O.\r\nPeschel and Prof. Ruge know him as Bering's principal officer, but not\r\nas the discoverer of the Kurile Islands and Japan from the north. And\r\nyet, just this was his task. He was to sail from Kamchatka to Nipon,\r\nchart the Kurile Islands, link the Russian explorations to the West\r\nEuropean cartography of northern Japan, and investigate the geography\r\nof the intervening region,--especially the cartographical monsters\r\nwhich in the course of a century of contortion had developed from De\r\nVries's intelligent map of East Yezo, Iturup (Staaten Eiland) and\r\nUrup (Kompagniland). We have already spoken of these geographical\r\ndeformities, which assumed the most grotesque forms, and were at that\r\ntime accepted by the scientific world. The version of the brothers De\r\nl'Isle, which perhaps was the most sober, may be seen from Map II. in\r\nthe appendix.\r\n\r\nBy Strahlenberg (1730) and by Bellin and Charlesvoix (1735), highly\r\nrespected names among scholars of that day, Kamchatka and Yezo\r\nwere represented as forming a great continent separated by narrow\r\nsounds from Japan, which was continued on the meridian of Kamchatka\r\nand Yezo, and from an eastern chain of islands--Staaten Eiland and\r\nKompagniland--that seemed to project into the Pacific in the form of a\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nKiriloff, who was familiar with Bering's map of eastern Asia, and\r\nmade use of it, and who knew of the most northerly Kuriles, made\r\nthe necessary corrections in his general map of Russia (1734), but\r\nretained, in regard to Yezo and Japan, a strangely unfortunate\r\ncomposition of Dutch and Strahlenberg accounts, and put Nipon (Hondo)\r\nmuch too far to the east. In these cartographical aids Spangberg found\r\nonly errors and confusion, and he got about the same kind of assistance\r\nfrom his real predecessors in practical exploration. Peschel tells\r\nthat Ivan Kosyrefski, in the years 1712-13, thoroughly investigated\r\nthe Kurile chain; there is, however, but little truth in this. Peschel\r\ngives G. F. Müller as his authority and refers to his book, but the\r\nlatter says explicitly on this point: \"All of Kosyrefski's voyages\r\nwere confined to the first two or three Kuriles; farther than this he\r\ndid not go, and whatever he tells of beyond them was obtained from the\r\naccounts of others.\" It is possible that Müller's judgment is a trifle\r\none-sided, but it is nevertheless certain that Kosyrefski's description\r\nof the Kuriles is based on his own explorations only in a very slight\r\ndegree, and that he by no means deserves the place that Peschel and\r\nRuge have accorded him. Nor did Lushin's and Yevrinoff's expedition in\r\nthe summer of 1721 get very far--scarcely beyond the fifth or sixth\r\nisland--and with them, until Spangberg appeared on the scene, Russian\r\nexplorations in this quarter were at a standstill.\r\n\r\nThe expedition to Japan (1738) was undertaken with three ships.\r\nSpangberg and Petroff sailed the one-masted brig, the Archangel\r\nMichael, Lieutenant Walton and first mate Kassimiroff the three-masted\r\ndouble sloop Hope, and Second-Lieutenant Schelting had Bering's old\r\nvessel, the Gabriel. The Michael had a crew of sixty-three, among them\r\na monk, a physician, and an assayer, and each of the other two ships\r\nhad a crew of forty-four. The flotilla left Okhotsk on the 18th of\r\nJune, 1738, but was detained in the Sea of Okhotsk by ice, and did not\r\nreach Bolsheretsk until the early part of July. From here, on the 15th\r\nof July, Spangberg departed for the Kuriles to begin charting.\r\n\r\nThe Kurile chain, the thousand islands or Chi-Shima, as the Japanese\r\ncall them, is 650 kilometers long. These islands are simply a multitude\r\nof crater crests which shoot up out of the sea, and on that account\r\nmake navigation very difficult. The heavy fog, which almost continually\r\nprevails here, conceals all landmarks. In the great depths, sounding\r\nafforded little assistance, and, furthermore, around these islands\r\nand through the narrow channels there are heavy breakers and swift\r\ncurrents.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a century after Spangberg, these obstacles defied some of\r\nthe world's bravest seamen. Captain Gore, who was last in command\r\nof Cook's ships, was obliged to give up the task of charting this\r\nregion; La Pérouse succeeded in exploring only the Boussale channel;\r\nthe fogs forced Admiral Sarycheff (1792) to give up his investigations\r\nhere; Captain Broughton (1796) was able to circumnavigate only the\r\nmost southerly islands, without, however, succeeding in giving a\r\ncorrect representation of them; and not until the early part of this\r\ncentury did Golovnin succeed in charting the group more accurately\r\nthan Spangberg. All of these difficulties were experienced in full\r\nmeasure by Spangberg's expedition. In constant combat with fogs, swift\r\ncurrents, and heavy seas along steep and rocky coasts, he had, by the\r\n3d of August, 1738, circumnavigated thirty-one islands (our maps have\r\nnot nearly so large a number), and at a latitude of 45° 30' he reached\r\nthe large island Nadeshda, (the Kompagniland of the Dutch, Urup),\r\nbut, as he could nowhere find a place to anchor, and as the nights\r\nwere growing dark and long, the ship's bread running short, and the\r\ncrew for a long time having been on half rations, he turned back, and\r\nreached Bolsheretsk on the 17th of August. Lieutenant Walton, who had\r\nparted company with his chief and had sailed as far down as 43° 30'\r\nnorth latitude, thus reaching the parallel of Yezo, arrived a few days\r\nlater. As well as the other chiefs of these expeditions, Spangberg had\r\nauthority, without a renewed commission, to repeat the expedition the\r\nfollowing summer; hence the winter was spent in preparations for it.\r\nSo far as it was possible to do so, he sought to provision himself in\r\nKamchatka, and, especially for reconnoitering the coast, he built of\r\nbirchwood an eighteen-oared boat, called the Bolsheretsk.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of May, 1739, he again stood out to sea with all four\r\nships, and on the 25th of the same month he reached Kurile Strait,\r\nand from here sailed south southeast into the Pacific to search for\r\nGamaland and all the legendary group of islands which appeared on\r\nDe l'Isle's map. This southerly course, about on the meridian of\r\nKamchatka, he kept until the 8th of June, reaching a latitude of 42°.\r\nAs he saw nothing but sea and sky, he veered to the west southwest\r\nfor the purpose of \"doing the lands\" near the coast of Japan. Walton,\r\nwho, in spite of Spangberg's strictest orders, was constantly seeking\r\nto go off on his own tack, finally, on the 14th of June, found an\r\nopportunity to steal away and sail in a southwesterly direction. In\r\ndifferent latitudes, but on the same day, the 16th of June, both\r\ndiscovered land. Walton followed the coast of Nipon down to latitude\r\n33°, but Spangberg confined his explorations to the region between 39°\r\nand 37° 30' N. The country was very rich. A luxuriant vegetation--grape\r\nvines, orange trees and palms--decked its shores. Rich fields of rice,\r\nnumerous villages, and populous cities were observed from the vessel.\r\nThe sea teemed with fish of enormous size and peculiar form, and the\r\ncurrents brought them strange and unknown plants. The arrival of the\r\nships caused great excitement among the natives, beacons burned along\r\nthe coast all night, and cruisers swarmed about them at a respectful\r\ndistance. On the 22d, Spangberg cast anchor one verst from shore, and\r\nsought to communicate with them. The Japanese brought rice, tobacco,\r\nvarious kinds of fruits and cloths, which, on very reasonable terms,\r\nthey exchanged for Russian wares. They were very polite, and Spangberg\r\nsucceeded in obtaining some gold coins, which, however, he found were\r\ndescribed by Kæmpfer. Several persons of high rank visited him in his\r\ncabin and attempted to explain to him, by the aid of his map and globe,\r\nthe geography of Japan and Yezo. As his instructions enjoined upon him\r\nthe most extreme cautiousness, and as on the following day he found\r\nhimself surrounded by eighty large boats, each with ten or twelve men,\r\nhe weighed anchor and stood out to sea in a northeasterly direction.\r\n\r\nIt was Spangberg's purpose to chart the southern part of the Kurile\r\nIslands, and, as will be seen from his chart,[69] he sought to\r\naccomplish his task, and thus complete his work of 1738. The casual\r\nobserver will, however, find this map unsatisfactory and inaccurate,\r\nand will not only be quite confused in viewing these islands so\r\npromiscuously scattered about, and which seemingly do not correspond\r\nwith the actual geography of this region as known to us, but he will\r\neven be inclined to suspect Spangberg of gross fraud. This is certainly\r\nvery unjust, however, and after a careful study of a modern map, I\r\nventure the following opinion on this subject: In order to be able to\r\nunderstand his chart and course, the most essential thing necessary\r\nis simply to determine his first place of landing in the Kuriles,\r\nthe island Figurnyi, and to identify it with its present name. He\r\ndiscovered this island on the 3d of July. Müller says that, according\r\nto the ship's journal, it is in latitude 43° 50' N., and in spite\r\nof the fact that Spangberg's determinations in longitude, based on\r\nthe ship's calculations, were as a rule somewhat inaccurate, which\r\nin a measure is shown by Nipon's being located so far west, he is\r\nnevertheless in this case right. Figurnyi is the island Sikotan and has\r\nthe astronomical position of this island on the chart (according to\r\nGolovnin 43° 53' N. and 146° 43' 30\" E.). This opinion is corroborated\r\nby a map of the Russian discoveries published at St. Petersburg in\r\n1787, and by Captain Broughton, who described the island in the fall of\r\n1796, and gave it the name of Spangberg's Island, in honor of its first\r\ndiscoverer. With this point fixed, it is not difficult to understand\r\nand follow Spangberg.\r\n\r\nSpangberg labored under very unfavorable circumstances. It rained\r\nconstantly, the coast was enveloped in heavy fogs, and at times it was\r\nimpossible to see land at a distance of eight yards. From Figurnyi\r\nhe sailed southwest, but under these difficult circumstances he took\r\nthe little islands of Taroko and the northern point of Yezo to be\r\none continuous coast (Seljonyi, the green island), and anchored at\r\nthe head of Walvisch bay, his Bay of Patience. From here he saw the\r\nwestern shore of the bay, reached its farthest point, Cape Notske, and\r\ndiscovered the peninsula of Sirokot and parts of the island Kumashiri,\r\nwhich he called Konosir and Tsyntrounoi respectively; but, as he turned\r\nfrom Cape Notske and sailed east into the Pacific, between Sikotan and\r\nthe Taroko Islands, he did not reach the Kurile Islands themselves,\r\nand only the most northerly island in the group of the \"Three Sisters\"\r\nmay possibly be the southern point of Iturup. He then proceeded along\r\nthe eastern coast of Yezo, took the deep bay of Akischis as a strait\r\nseparating Seljonyi and Konosir, then crossed in a southerly direction\r\nthe large bay on the central coast of Yezo, without seeing land at its\r\nhead, to Cape Jerimo (his Matmai), and had thus navigated the whole\r\neast coast of Yezo; but on account of the heavy fog, which prevented\r\nhim from seeing the exact outline of the coast, he made three islands\r\nof Yezo: Matmai, Seljonyi and Konosir. In 1643, De Vries had in his\r\nmap linked a number of islands together, making one stretch of country\r\ncalled Jeço, and now Spangberg had gone to the opposite extreme.\r\n\r\nThese explorations engaged Spangberg from the 3d to the 25th of July.\r\nHe several times met inhabitants of North Yezo, the Aïno people, whose\r\nprincipal characteristics he has fully described, but as his men were\r\nsuffering from scurvy, causing frequent deaths among them (by August\r\n29, when he arrived at Okhotsk, he had lost thirteen, among them the\r\nphysician), he resolved to turn at Cape Jerimo, and on his return\r\ntrip keep his course so close to the Kuriles that he might strike the\r\nextreme points of De l'Isle's Jeço, all of Kompagniland, and the most\r\nwesterly parts of Gamaland.\r\n\r\nSpangberg's explorations were far from exhaustive. He but partly\r\nsucceeded in lifting the veil that so persistently concealed the\r\ntrue outline of this irregularly formed part of the globe. His\r\nreconnoissance was to ascertain the general oceanic outline of\r\nthese coasts. His charting of Yezo and Saghalin was left to a much\r\nlater day,--to La Pérouse, to Krusenstern, Golovnin, and others.\r\nBut Spangberg's expedition nevertheless marks great progress in our\r\ngeographical knowledge, for not only did he irrevocably banish the\r\ncartographical myths of that region, and, on the whole, give a correct\r\nrepresentation of the Kurile islands clear to Iturup, the next to the\r\nlast of them, but he also determined the position of North Japan, and\r\nfully accomplished his original task, namely, to show the Russians the\r\nway to Japan, and thus add this long disputed part of the Northeast\r\npassage to the other explorations for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nAs was the case with that of all of his colleagues, so Spangberg's\r\nreputation suffered under the violent administrative changes and that\r\nsystem of suppression which later prevailed in Russia. His reports were\r\nnever made public. The Russian cartographers made use of his chart,\r\nbut they did not understand how to fit judiciously his incomplete\r\ncoast-lines to those already known, or to distinguish right from\r\nwrong. They even omitted the course of his vessel, thus excluding all\r\npossibility of understanding his work. Hence Spangberg's chart never\r\nreached West Europe, and Cook found it necessary to reinstate him as\r\nwell as Bering.[70] After that the feeling was more favorable, and\r\nCoxe,[71] for instance, used his representation of the Kuriles; but\r\nnew and better outlines of this region appeared about this time, and\r\nSpangberg again sank into complete oblivion.\r\n\r\nSpangberg's safe return was a bright spot in the history of the Great\r\nNorthern Expedition, and Bering was very well satisfied with the\r\nresults. He permitted him and his crew to go to Yakutsk to obtain rest,\r\nand ordered him to return to St. Petersburg the next spring to render\r\nin person an account of the results of the expedition. His preliminary\r\nreport, sent in advance, received considerable attention in the cabinet\r\nof the Empress, and caused much talk in the leading circles of the\r\ncapital. While in Yakutsk, he received orders to travel day and night\r\nto reach St. Petersburg. Meanwhile, however, his old enemy Pissarjeff\r\nhad also been active. Surreptitiously, especially from Walton, who was\r\nconstantly at enmity with his chief, he had obtained some information\r\nconcerning the expedition and had reported to the Senate that Spangberg\r\nhad not been in Japan at all, but off the coast of Corea. This\r\nassertion he sought to prove by referring to pre-Spangberg maps, which,\r\nas we have noted, placed Japan eleven or twelve degrees too far east,\r\ndirectly south of Kamchatka. This gossip was credited in the Senate,\r\nand a courier was dispatched to stop Spangberg. At Fort Kirinsk, on the\r\nLena, in the summer of 1740, he received orders to return to Okhotsk\r\nand repeat his voyage to Japan, while a commission of naval officers\r\nand scholars betook themselves to investigate the matter. These wise\r\nmen, after several years of deliberation, came to the conclusion that\r\nWalton had been in Japan, and that Spangberg most probably had been off\r\nthe coast of Corea. In the summer of 1742, he started out on his third\r\nexpedition to Japan, but as this was a complete failure, undoubtedly\r\ndue to Spangberg's anger on account of the government's unjust and\r\ninsane action, and as it has no geographical significance, we shall\r\ngive it no further consideration.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[69] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[70] Note 53.\r\n\r\n[71] Note 54.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n  PREPARATIONS FOR BERING'S VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY TO AMERICA.--FOUNDING\r\n    OF PETROPAVLOVSK.--THE BROTHERS DE L'ISLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left Bering when, in 1740, he was about to depart from the harbor of\r\nOkhotsk with the St. Peter and the St. Paul, two smaller transports,\r\nand a vessel to convey the scientists, Steller and La Croyère, to\r\nBolsheretsk. The objective point of the main expedition was Avacha\r\nBay, on the eastern coast of Kamchatka. The excellent harbors here had\r\nbeen discovered by Bering's crew a couple of years previous. He had\r\nnow sent his mate, Yelagin, to chart the bay, find a sheltered harbor\r\nthere, and establish a fortified place of abode on this coast. This\r\nwork Yelagin completed in the summer of 1740, and when in the latter\r\npart of September the packet boats entered Avacha Bay, they found, in a\r\nsmaller bay on the north side, Niakina Cove, some barracks and huts. A\r\nfort was built in the course of the winter and the pious Bering had a\r\nchurch built and consecrated to St. Peter and St. Paul, thus founding\r\nthe present town of Petropavlovsk. The place rapidly became the most\r\nimportant and pleasant town of the peninsula, although that is not\r\nsaying much. In 1779, the place was still so insignificant that Cook's\r\nofficers searched long in vain for it with their field-glasses, but\r\nfinally discovered about thirty huts on that point which shelters\r\nthe harbor. In the middle of this century it had about a thousand\r\ninhabitants, but since the sale of Russian America, Bering's town\r\nhas been hopelessly on the decline. At present it has scarcely 600\r\ninhabitants and is of importance only to the fur trade.\r\n\r\nIts first permanent inhabitants were brought from the forts on\r\nthe Kamchatka, and in the course of the autumn there arrived from\r\nAnadyrskoi Ostrog a herd of reindeer to supply the command of over\r\ntwo hundred men with food, and thus spare other stores. This was very\r\nnecessary, for although Bering had left Okhotsk with nearly two years'\r\nprovisions, one of the ships, through the carelessness of an officer,\r\nstranded in crossing the Okhotsk bar, and the cargo, consisting of the\r\nship's bread for the voyage to America, was destroyed and could not\r\nimmediately be replaced. Some lesser misfortunes in Avacha Bay further\r\ndiminished the stores, and hence, in the course of the winter, Bering\r\nfound it necessary to have large supplies brought across the country\r\nfrom Bolsheretsk. The distance is about one hundred and forty miles,\r\nand as nothing but dogs could be procured, the natives were gathered\r\nfrom the remotest quarters of the peninsula to accomplish this work of\r\ntransportation. The Kamshadales disliked journeys very much. They had\r\nalready suffered terribly under the misrule of the Cossacks. They were\r\ntreated cruelly, and many died of overwork and want, and the rest lost\r\npatience. The tribes in the vicinity of Tigil revolted. The Cossack\r\nchief Kolessoff, who was constantly drunk, neglected to superintend\r\nthe transportation, and as a result, much was injured or ruined. Some\r\nof those supplies arrived too late to be used for the expedition.\r\nBering's original plan was to spend two years on this expedition. He\r\nwas to winter on the American coast, navigate it from 60° N. latitude\r\nto Bering Strait, and then return along the coast of Asia. But this had\r\nto be abandoned.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1741, when the ice broke up, he could supply his ships with\r\nfrugal, not to say very poor, provisions, for only five and a half\r\nmonths. Moreover, his ship's stores and reserve rigging were both\r\nincomplete and inadequate. Bering's powers of resistance now began to\r\nwane. After eight years of incessant trouble and toil, after all the\r\naccusations and suspicions he had undergone, he was now forced to face\r\nthe thought of an unsatisfactory conclusion of his first voyage, at\r\nleast. Besides, Spangberg's fate could not but have a very depressing\r\ninfluence, for it told Bering and his associates that even with the\r\nbest of results it would hardly be possible to overcome the prejudices\r\nof the government authorities or their lack of confidence in the\r\nefforts of the new marine service. Undoubtedly it was such thoughts\r\nas these that swayed Bering and Chirikoff, when, on the 4th of May,\r\nthey called the ship's council to consider the prospective voyage (the\r\nproceedings are not known). Although both, as well as the best of their\r\nofficers, were of the opinion that America[72] was to be sought in a\r\ndirection east by north from Avacha, and in spite of the fact that they\r\nwere both familiar with Gvosdjeff's discovery of the American coast\r\nof Bering Strait (1732), and that their observations during the course\r\nof the winter had amply corroborated Bering's earlier opinion, they\r\nnevertheless allowed themselves to be prevailed upon to search first in\r\na southeasterly direction for the legendary Gamaland. And thus the lid\r\nof Pandora's box was lifted.\r\n\r\nThis fatal resolution was due principally to the brothers De l'Isle,\r\nand, as this name is most decisively connected with Bering's life\r\nand renown, we must say a few words about these brothers. The elder\r\nand more talented, Guillaume De l'Isle, undoubtedly represented the\r\ngeographical knowledge of his day, but he died as early as 1726. He\r\ncame in personal contact with the Czar during the latter's visit in\r\nParis, and corresponded with him afterwards. His maps were the worst\r\nstumbling blocks to Bering's first voyage. The younger brother, Joseph\r\nNicolas, on the other hand, was called to Russia in 1726, on his\r\nbrother's recommendation, and was appointed chief astronomer of the\r\nnewly founded Academy. In this position he was for twenty-one years\r\nengaged upon the cartography of the great Russian empire. Under his\r\nsupervision the atlas of the Academy appeared in 1745, and it was\r\nsupposed that he carried very valuable geographical collections with\r\nhim to Paris in 1747. But if this was the case, he did not understand\r\nhow to make proper use of them, and, as it is, he is of no geographical\r\nimportance. When he went to Russia, he took with him, without special\r\ninvitation, his elder brother, Louis, and did everything to secure\r\nhim a scientific position in the country. Louis seems to have been\r\nan amiable good-for-nothing, who highly prized a good table and a\r\nsocial glass, but cared as little as possible for scientific pursuits.\r\nWhen, as a young man, he studied theology in Paris, his father found\r\nit necessary to send him to Canada, where he assumed his mother's\r\nname, La Croyère, and for seventeen years lived a soldier's wild life,\r\nuntil his brothers, on the death of the father, recalled him from his\r\nexile. In St. Petersburg his brother instructed him in the elements\r\nof astronomy, sent him upon a surveying expedition to Lapland, and\r\nfinally secured him a position as chief astronomer of Bering's second\r\nexpedition. This was a great mistake. Louis de l'Isle de la Croyère\r\nvery unsatisfactorily filled his position. His Academic associates\r\nMüller and Gmelin had no regard for him whatever, and hence under\r\nthe pressure of this contempt, and as a result of this irregular and\r\nprotracted life in a barbaric country, La Croyère, having no native\r\npower of resistance, sank deeper and deeper into hopeless sluggishness.\r\nHis astronomical determinations in Kamchatka are worthless. His Russian\r\nassistants, especially Krassilnikoff, did this part of the work of the\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1730, Bering, as we have seen, came into unfortunate\r\nrelations with Joseph De l'Isle, and this state of affairs afterwards\r\ngrew gradually worse. In 1731, the Senate requested the latter to\r\nconstruct a map of the northern part of the Pacific in order to present\r\ngraphically the still unsolved problems for geographical research. He\r\nsubmitted this map to the Senate on the 6th of October, 1732, that\r\nis, two years and a half after Bering's proposition to undertake the\r\nGreat Northern Expedition, but this did not deter him, in 1750, from\r\nascribing to himself, on the basis of this same map and an accompanying\r\nmemoir, Bering's proposition, nor from publishing an entirely perverted\r\naccount of Bering's second expedition. He clung to all of his brother's\r\nconjectures about Gamaland, Kompagniland, and Staatenland as well as\r\nJeço, although they were based on very unreliable accounts and the\r\ncartographical distortions of several generations. On the other hand,\r\nhe most arbitrarily rejected all Russian accounts of far more recent\r\nand reliable origin, so that only Bering's and part of Yevrinoff's\r\nand Lushin's outlines of the first Kuriles were allowed to appear\r\non the official map. He would rather reject all Russian works that\r\ncould be made doubtful, than his brother's authority, and even in\r\n1753, over twenty years after Spangberg's and Bering's voyages, he\r\npersistently sought to maintain his brother Guillaume's and his own\r\nunreasonable ideas concerning the cartography of this region. It was\r\nin part this dogged persistence in clinging to family prejudices that\r\nrobbed Spangberg of his well-earned reward and brought Bering's last\r\nexpedition to a sad end.\r\n\r\nWhen the second Kamchatkan expedition left St. Petersburg, a copy of De\r\nl'Isle's map was given to Bering as well as to La Croyère. De l'Isle\r\nwrote the latter's instructions--ably written, by the way--and it was\r\na result of his efforts that the Senate ordered Bering and Chirikoff\r\nto consult with La Croyère concerning the route to America,--a very\r\nreasonable decree in case he had been a good geographer. As it was, the\r\norder simply meant that they were to go according to the regulations\r\nof De l'Isle in St. Petersburg. In the ship's council on the 4th of\r\nMay, 1741, La Croyère immediately produced the above-mentioned map,\r\nand directed the expedition first to find Gamaland, which, it was\r\nclaimed, could lie but a few days' sailing toward the southeast, and\r\nwould furnish good assistance in finding America. But La Croyère was\r\nonly a spokesman for his brother, who in his memoir had constructed\r\nhis principal reasoning on this basis. He says here that America can\r\nbe reached from the Chukchee peninsula as well as from the mouth of\r\nthe Kamchatka River, but with greatest ease and certainty from Avacha\r\nBay in a southeasterly direction to the northern coast of Gamaland.\r\nIn order to support this supposition he adds: \"It grieves me not to\r\nhave found other information about this land seen by Don Juan de Gama\r\nthan what is given on the map of my late brother, his most Christian\r\nMajesty's first geographer. But as he indicated the position of this\r\ncountry with reference to Kompagniland and Jeço, and as I am certain,\r\nfrom other sources, of the position of these two countries, I am\r\nconsequently convinced of their correct situation and distance from\r\nKamchatka.\"\r\n\r\nThat these miserable arguments exercised any influence upon the ship's\r\ncouncil on the 4th of May, would seem impossible, if we did not bear\r\nin mind the conduct of the authorities in St. Petersburg. Two years\r\nprevious Spangberg had sailed right across Kompagniland, Staatenland\r\nand Jeço, and thus made every point in De l'Isle's argument untenable.\r\nBering and Chirikoff were familiar with the results of these voyages,\r\nand shared Spangberg's opinion. For this reason they could not possibly\r\nascribe any great importance to De l'Isle's directions which were\r\nbased on antiquated assumptions, but on the other hand, they had\r\nneither moral nor practical independence enough to take their own\r\ncourse. The government laws, and especially the Senate decrees, bound\r\ntheir hands. They were to submit all important measures to the action\r\nof a commission, and were far from being sovereign commanders in any\r\nmodern sense. Under these circumstances they found it advisable, and\r\npossibly necessary, to act in accordance with the opinion of these\r\nlearned scholars, so as to be able later to defend themselves in every\r\nparticular against the criticisms of the Academy. Hence the commission\r\nresolved that the expedition should first find the northern coast of\r\nGamaland, follow this coast in an easterly direction to America, and\r\nturn back in time to be at home in Avacha Bay by the end of September.\r\nIn this way their ships were carried far into the Pacific and away from\r\nthe Aleutian chain of islands, which, like the thread of Ariadne, would\r\nspeedily have led them to the western continent.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[72] Note 55.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n  THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA FROM THE EAST.--STELLER INDUCED TO JOIN THE\r\n    EXPEDITION.--THE SEPARATION OF THE ST. PETER AND THE ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of the month of May the vessels were equipped and\r\nsupplied with provisions for five and a half months, several cords\r\nof wood, 100 casks of water, and two rowboats each. The St. Peter,\r\ncommanded by Bering, had a crew of 77, among whom were Lieutenant\r\nWaxel, shipmaster Khitroff, the mates Hesselberg, and Jushin, the\r\nsurgeon Betge, the conductor Plenisner, Ofzyn (whom we remember as\r\nthe officer who had been reduced in rank), and Steller. On board the\r\nSt. Paul, commanded by Lieut. Alexei Chirikoff, were found the marine\r\nofficers Chegatchoff and Plautin, La Croyère, and the assistant surgeon\r\nLau,--in all about 76 men. Before his departure, Bering had a very\r\ndifficult matter to arrange. His instructions directed him to take\r\nwith him to America a mineralogist; but when Spangberg had started out\r\non his unexpected expedition to Japan, Bering had sent with him the\r\nmineralogist Hartelpol, and now he found it impossible in East Siberia\r\nto get a man to fill his place. Hence, as early as February, Bering\r\napplied to Steller and tried to induce him to take upon himself the\r\nduties of naturalist and mineralogist on this expedition.\r\n\r\nSteller was born at Windsheim, Germany, in 1709. He first studied\r\ntheology and had even begun to preach, when the study of science\r\nsuddenly drew him from the church. He studied medicine and botany,\r\npassed the medical examinations in Berlin, and lectured on medicine in\r\nHalle. Then, partly as a matter of necessity and partly from a desire\r\nto travel, he went to Danzig, where he became surgeon on a Russian\r\nvessel, and finally, after a series of vicissitudes, he landed in St.\r\nPetersburg as a lecturer in the Academy of Science. According to his\r\nown desire he went to Siberia as Gmelin's and Müller's assistant, and,\r\nas these gentlemen found it altogether too uncomfortable to travel\r\nany farther east than Yakutsk, he took upon himself the exploration\r\nof Kamchatka. He was an enthusiast in science, who heeded neither\r\nobstacles nor dangers, a keen and successful observer, who has enriched\r\nscience with several classical chapters, and had an ardent and\r\npassionate nature that attacked without regard to persons every form of\r\ninjustice. His pen could be shaped to epigrammatic sharpness, and his\r\ntongue spared no one. In 1741, he wished to extend his investigations\r\nto Japan, and had, when Bering sought to secure his services, sent to\r\nthe Academy a request to be permitted to participate in Spangberg's\r\nthird expedition. Steller had, however, great hesitancy about leaving\r\nhis special field of investigation without orders or permission, and\r\nBering had to assume all responsibility to the Senate and Academy,\r\nand also secure for him from a council of all the ship's officers an\r\nassurance of the position as mineralogist of the expedition, before he\r\ncould be induced to accept. Bering is said to have charged him verbally\r\nto make observations in all the departments of natural history, and\r\npromised him all necessary assistance. Steller accuses Bering of not\r\nhaving kept his promises, and, although he preserved until the last\r\na high regard for Bering's seamanship and noble character, there\r\nnevertheless developed, during the expedition, a vehement enmity\r\nbetween Steller and the naval officers, especially Waxel and Khitroff,\r\nand this enmity found very pregnant expression in Steller's diary,[73]\r\nwhich, in this respect, is more a pamphlet than a description of\r\ntravel. It is impossible, however, with our present resources, to\r\nascertain the true state of affairs. Concerning Bering's voyage to\r\nAmerica, we have only the St. Peter's journals kept by Waxel, Jushin,\r\nand Khitroff, and an account by Waxel, all of which have been used\r\nby Sokoloff in the preparation of the memoirs of the hydrographic\r\ndepartment. Steller's diary, which goes into a detailed account of\r\nthings in quite a different way than the official reports, was also\r\nused by Sokoloff, but as the latter had but little literary taste\r\nand still less sympathy for the contending parties, especially for\r\nBering, he does not attempt to dispense justice between them. Steller's\r\ncriticism must be looked upon as an eruption of that ill-humor which\r\nso often and so easily arises in the relations between the chief\r\nof an expedition and the accompanying scientists, between men with\r\ndivergent interests and different aims. Bering and Steller, Cook and\r\nhis naturalists, Kotzebue and Chamisso, are prominent examples of this\r\ndisagreement. It is well known that Cook called the naturalists \"the\r\ndamned disturbers of the peace,\" and that he more than once threatened\r\nto put them off on some island or other in the ocean. Steller accuses\r\nBering of having too much regard for his subordinate officers, but\r\nin all likelihood these had made the countercharge that he gave too\r\nmuch heed to the scientists. At any rate, Bering has often been blamed\r\nfor--in accordance with his instruction--letting La Croyère take part\r\nin the councils at Avacha. But we must not forget that Steller was a\r\nhot-headed and passionate fellow who persistently maintained his own\r\nopinions. From many points in his accounts, it appears that during this\r\nwhole expedition he was in a state of geographical confusion; and even\r\nafter his return he seemed to imagine that the two continents were\r\nseparated by simply a narrow channel. He was guided by observations of\r\na scientific nature, and, as the course of the St. Peter was no farther\r\nfrom the Aleutian Islands than the appearance of seaweed, seals, and\r\nbirds indicated, he constantly imagined that they were off the coast of\r\nthe New World. The naval officers, on the other hand, sought guidance\r\nin sounding; but as their course carried them out upon the great depths\r\nof the Pacific, the northern wall of which very precipitously ascends\r\nto the Aleutian Islands, their measurements were of no assistance, and\r\nin various points Steller was undoubtedly correct. The principal reason\r\nfor Steller's complaint must be sought in Bering's illness, and it is\r\neasily perceived that, if the scurvy had not at a very early stage\r\nundermined his strength, his superior seamanship would have secured the\r\nexpedition quite different results than those that were obtained.\r\n\r\nAfter a prayer service, the ships weighed anchor on the 4th of June,\r\n1741. Expectations on board were great,--the New World was to open up\r\nbefore them. According to the plan adopted, a southeasterly course was\r\ntaken, and in spite of some unfortunate friction, Bering gave Chirikoff\r\nthe lead, so as to leave him no cause for complaint. They kept their\r\ncourse until the afternoon of June 12, when they found themselves,\r\nafter having sailed over six hundred miles in a southeasterly\r\ndirection, in latitude 46° 9' N. and 14° 30' east of Avacha. According\r\nto De l'Isle's map they should long before have come to the coasts of\r\nGamaland, but as they only saw sea and sky, Bering gave the command\r\nto turn back. With variable and unfavorable winds, they worked their\r\nway, during the few succeeding days, in a direction of N. N. E. up to\r\nlatitude 49° 30', where Chirikoff, on the 20th of June, in storm and\r\nfog, left Bering and sailed E. N. E. in the direction of the American\r\ncoast, without attempting to keep with the St. Peter. This was the\r\nfirst real misfortune of the expedition. For forty-eight hours Bering\r\nkept close to the place of separation, in hopes of again joining the\r\nSt. Paul, and, as this proved fruitless, he convened a ship's council,\r\nat which it was decided to give up all further search for the St. Paul;\r\nit was also resolved--in order to remove every doubt--to sail again\r\nto the 46th degree to find Gamaland. Having arrived here, some birds\r\nwere seen, whereupon they continued their course to 45° 16' N. and\r\n16° 28' east of Avacha, but of course without any results. During the\r\nfour succeeding weeks, the ship's course was between north and east,\r\ntoward the western continent, but as on their southern course they\r\nhad come out upon the depths of Tuscarora, which, several thousand\r\nfathoms deep, run right up to the Aleutian reef, their soundings\r\ngave them no clue to land, although they were sailing almost parallel\r\nwith this chain of islands. But Bering was now confined to his cabin.\r\nThe troubles he had passed through, his sixty years of age, and the\r\nincipient stages of scurvy, had crushed his powers of resistance, while\r\nhis officers, Waxel and Khitroff, dismissed Steller's observations\r\nwith scornful sarcasm. Not until the 12th of July did they take any\r\nprecautions against a sudden landing. They took in some of the sails\r\nduring the night and hove to. They had then been on the sea about six\r\nweeks. Their supply of water was about half gone, and according to\r\nthe ship's calculations, which show an error of 8°, they had sailed\r\n46-1/2° (_i. e._, 54-1/2°) from the meridian of Avacha. The ship's\r\ncouncil therefore concluded, on the 13th of July, to sail due north,\r\nheading N. N. E., and at noon on the 16th of July, in a latitude by\r\nobservation of 58° 14' and a longitude of 49-1/2° east of Avacha, they\r\nfinally saw land to the north.[74] The country was elevated, the coast\r\nwas jagged, covered with snow, inhospitable, and girt with islands,\r\nbehind which a snow-capped mountain peak towered so high into the\r\nclouds that it could be seen at a distance of seventy miles. \"I do\r\nnot remember,\" says Steller, \"of having seen a higher mountain in all\r\nSiberia and Kamchatka.\" This mountain was the volcano St. Elias, which\r\nis about 18,000 feet high. _Bering had thus succeeded in discovering\r\nAmerica from the east._ As they had a head wind, they moved very slowly\r\ntoward the north, and not until the morning of the 20th did they cast\r\nanchor off the western coast of an island which they called Sct. Ilii\r\n(St. Elias) in honor of the patron saint of the day. On the same day,\r\nKhitroff with fifteen men went, in the ship's boat, to search for a\r\nharbor and to explore the island and its nearest surroundings. Steller,\r\nwho had desired to accompany him, was put ashore with the crew that\r\nbrought fresh water from St. Elias, and endeavored, as well as it was\r\npossible in a few hours, to investigate the natural history of the\r\nisland. Khitroff circumnavigated the island and found various traces\r\nof human habitation. Thus, on one of the adjacent islands, a timbered\r\nhouse was found containing a fireplace, a bark basket, a wooden spade,\r\nsome mussel shells, and a whetstone, which apparently had been used\r\nfor sharpening copper implements. In an earth-hut another detachment\r\nhad found some smoked fish, a broken arrow, the remains of a fire, and\r\nseveral other things. The coast of the mainland, which was mountainous\r\nwith snow-capped peaks, was seen at a distance of eight miles. A good\r\nharbor was found on the north side of the large island. All the islands\r\nwere covered with trees, but these were so low and slender that timber\r\navailable for yards was not to be found. On his venturesome wanderings\r\nhere, only now and then accompanied by a Cossack, Steller penetrated\r\nthese woods, where he discovered a cellar, which contained articles\r\nof food and various implements. As some of these things were sent on\r\nboard, Bering, by way of indemnification, caused to be placed there an\r\niron kettle, a pound of tobacco, a Chinese pipe, and a piece of silk\r\ncloth.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[73] Note 56.\r\n\r\n[74] H. H. Bancroft, History of Alaska, p. 79, has the following note:\r\n\"The date of Bering's discovery, or the day when land was first sighted\r\nby the lookout, has been variously stated. Müller makes it the 20th of\r\nJuly, and Steller the 18th; the 16th is in accordance with Bering's\r\njournal, and according to Bering's observation the latitude was 58°\r\n28'. This date is confirmed by a manuscript chart compiled by Petroff\r\nand Waxel, with the help of the original log-books of both vessels.\r\nThe claim set up by certain Spanish writers in favor of Francisco\r\nGali as first discoverer of this region is based on a misprint in an\r\nearly account of his voyage. For particulars see Hist. Cal., I., this\r\nseries.\"--TR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n  BERING'S PLACE OF LANDING ON THE AMERICAN COAST.--CAPTAIN COOK'S\r\n    UNCERTAINTY.--THE QUESTION DISCUSSED AND DEFINITELY SETTLED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn geographical literature complete uncertainty in regard to Bering's\r\nisland St. Elias and its situation off the American coast still\r\nprevails. This uncertainty is due partly to Müller and partly to Cook.\r\nMüller is inaccurate; in fact, confused. He says that Bering saw the\r\nAmerican continent in a latitude of 58° 28', and at a difference of\r\nlongitude from Avacha of 50° (in reality, 58° 14' and 56° 30'), but he\r\ngives neither the latitude nor longitude of the island of St. Elias,\r\nwhich is the important point, and on his map of 1758, where he goes\r\ninto details more than in his description, he marked on latitude 58°\r\n28': \"_Coast discovered by Bering in 1741._\" On such vague reports\r\nnothing can be based. In the ship's journal, however, which Müller in\r\nall likelihood must have seen, the latitude of the island is entered as\r\n59° 40', and the longitude, according to the ship's calculations, as\r\n48° 50' east of Avacha. But as Bering's calculations, on account of the\r\nstrong current, which in these waters flows at a rate of twenty miles,\r\nhad an error of about 8°, the longitude becomes 56° 30' east of Avacha,\r\nand at this astronomical point, approximately correct, lies Kayak\r\nIsland, which is Cook's Kayes Island, having a latitude of 59° 47' and\r\na longitude of 56° 44' east of Avacha, and hence the question is to\r\nprove that this island really is the Guanahani of the Russians, that\r\nis, St. Elias.\r\n\r\nCook is the authority for the opinion which has hitherto prevailed; but\r\nsurely no one can be more uncertain and cautious on this point than he.\r\nHe says: \"Müller's report of the voyage is so abbreviated, and his map\r\nis so extremely inaccurate, that it is scarcely possible from the one\r\nor the other, or by comparing both, to point out a single place that\r\nthis navigator either saw or landed on. If I were to venture an opinion\r\non Bering's voyage along this coast, I should say that he sighted land\r\nin the vicinity of Mt. Fairweather. But I am in no way certain that the\r\nbay which I named in his honor is the place where he anchored. Nor do\r\nI know whether the mountain which I called Mt. St. Elias is the same\r\nconspicuous peak to which he gave this name, and I am entirely unable\r\nto locate his Cape St. Elias.\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem that such uncertain and reserved opinions were scarcely\r\nliable to be repeated without comment or criticism. But nevertheless,\r\nthe few reminiscences of this chapter of Bering's explorations\r\nwhich our present geography has preserved are obtained principally\r\nfrom Cook's map; for the first successors of this great navigator,\r\nDixon, 1785, La Pérouse, 1786, Malespina, 1791, and Vancouver, 1792,\r\nthrough whose efforts the northwest coast was scientifically charted,\r\nmaintained, with a few unimportant changes, Cook's views on this point.\r\nAccording to these views, Bering Bay was in 59° 18' north latitude\r\nand 139° west longitude, but Cook had not himself explored this bay;\r\nhe had simply found indications of a bay, and hence La Pérouse and\r\nVancouver, whose explorations were much more in detail, and who at\r\nthis place could find no bay, were obliged to seek elsewhere for it.\r\nLa Pérouse puts Bering Bay 10' farther south, at the present Alsekh\r\nRiver, northwest of Mt. Fairweather, the lagoon-shaped mouth of which\r\nhe calls _Rivière de Bering_, and Vancouver was of the opinion that in\r\nLa Pérouse's _Bay de Monti_, Dixon's Admiralty Bay, 59° 42' N. lat., he\r\nhad found Bering's place of landing. Vancouver's opinion has hitherto\r\nheld its own. The names Bering Bay, Admiralty Bay, or, as the Russians\r\ncall it, Yakutat, are found side by side; the latter, however, is\r\nbeginning to displace the former, and properly so, for Bering was never\r\nin or near this bay.[75]\r\n\r\nWhile this Cook cartography fixed Bering's place of landing too far\r\neast, the Russians committed the opposite error. On the chart with\r\nwhich the Admiralty provided Captain Billings on his great Pacific\r\nexpedition, the southern point of the Island of Montague, in Prince\r\nWilliam's Sound, (the Russian name of the island is Chukli), is\r\ngiven as Bering's promontory St. Elias, and the Admiralty gave him\r\nthe right, as soon as the expedition reached this point, to assume a\r\nhigher military rank, something which he actually did. But Admiral\r\nKrusenstern, with his usual keenness, comes as near the truth as it\r\nwas possible without having Bering's own chart and the ship's journal.\r\nHe thinks that, according to Steller's narrative, the St. Peter must\r\nhave touched America farther west than Yakutat Bay, and considers it\r\nquite probable that their anchoring place must be sought at one of the\r\npassages leading into Controller Bay, either between Cape Suckling\r\n(which on Russian maps is sometimes called Cape St. Elias) and Point\r\nLe Mesurier, or between the islands Kayak and Wingham. We shall soon\r\nsee that this last supposition is correct. O. Peschel has not ventured\r\nwholly to accept Krusenstern's opinion, but he nevertheless calls\r\nattention to the fact that Bering Bay is not correctly located. He\r\nfixes Bering's landing place west of Kayak Island, and contends against\r\nconsidering Mt. St. Elias as the promontory seen by Bering, something\r\nwhich would seem quite superfluous.[76]\r\n\r\nThis uncertainty is all the more striking, as, from the beginning of\r\nthis century, there have been accessible, in the works of Sauer and\r\nSarycheff, facts enough to establish the identity of the island of\r\nSt. Elias with the present Kayak Island, and since the publication\r\nof Bering's own map, in 1851, by the Russian Admiralty, there can no\r\nlonger be a shadow of a doubt. The map is found in the appendix of\r\nthis work, and hence a comparison between the islands of St. Elias and\r\nKayak is possible (Map IV). The astronomical situation of the islands,\r\ntheir position with reference to the mainland, their surroundings,\r\ncoast-lines, and geographical extension, the depths of the sea about\r\nboth--everything proves that they are identical; and, moreover, Sauer's\r\nand Sarycheff's descriptions, which are quite independent of the St.\r\nPeter's journal, coincide exactly with the journal's references to\r\nthe island of St. Elias. Sauer says that the island, from its most\r\nsoutherly point, extends in a northeasterly direction (\"trend north\r\n46° east\"), that it is twelve English miles long and two and a half\r\nmiles wide, that west of the island's most northerly point there is a\r\nsmaller island (Wingham), with various islets nearer the mainland, by\r\nwhich a well-protected harbor is formed behind a bar, with about seven\r\nfeet of water at ebb-tide,--hence just at the place where Khitroff,\r\nas we have already seen, found an available harbor for the St. Peter.\r\nThe journal, as well as Steller, describes St. Elias as mountainous,\r\nespecially in the southern part, thickly covered with low, coniferous\r\ntrees, and Waxel particularly mentions the fact that off the coast\r\nof the island's southern point, Bering's Cape St. Elias, there was a\r\nsingle cliff in the sea, a \"kekur,\" which is also marked on the map.\r\nSarycheff and Sauer speak of Kayak Island as mountainous and heavily\r\ntimbered. Its southern extremity rises above the rest of the island\r\nand ends very abruptly in a naked, white, saddle-shaped mountain.\r\nA solitary cliff of the same kind of rock, a pyramid-shaped pillar\r\n(\"kekur,\" \"_Abspringer_\") lies a few yards from the point. Cook, too,\r\nin his fine outlines of Kayak Island, puts this cliff directly south\r\nof the point. If we then consider that the true dimensions of Bering's\r\nisland plainly point to Kayak, that his course along the new coast\r\nis possible only on the same supposition that the direction in which\r\nBering from his anchorage saw Mt. St. Elias exactly coincides with\r\nthis mountain's position with reference to Kayak, that the soundings\r\ngiven by him agree with those of Kayak, but do not agree with those of\r\nMontague Island, which is surrounded by far more considerable depths\r\nthat have none of the above described characteristics, and which,\r\nmoreover, has so great a circumference that Khitroff could not possibly\r\nhave circumnavigated it in twelve hours, and finally, considering the\r\nfact that everything which Steller gives as signs that a large current\r\ndebouched near his anchorage finds an obvious explanation in the great\r\nCopper or Atna estuary, in 60° 17' N., then it will be difficult to\r\nresist the conviction that _Kayak is Bering's St. Elias, and that\r\nVancouver's Cape Hammond is his Cape St. Elias_.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the traditions of the natives corroborate this conclusion.\r\nWhile Billings's expedition was in Prince William's Sound, says Sauer,\r\nan old man came on board and related that every summer his tribe went\r\non hunting expeditions to Kayak.[77] Many years before, while he was\r\na boy, the first ship came to the island and anchored close to its\r\nwestern coast. A boat was sent ashore, but when it approached land\r\nall the natives fled, and not until the ship had disappeared did they\r\nreturn to their huts, where in their underground store-rooms they found\r\nsome beads, leaves (tobacco), an iron kettle, and some other things.\r\nSarycheff gives an account of this meeting, which in the main agrees\r\nwith Billings's. These stories also agree with Steller's account.[78]\r\n\r\nThese facts have not before, so far as the author knows, been linked\r\ntogether, but Sokoloff states, without proof, however, that Bering's\r\nlandfall was Kayak Island.[79] This correct view is now beginning to\r\nfind its way into American maps, where, in the latest works, Cape St.\r\nElias will be found in the proper place, together with a Bering Haven\r\non the northern coast of Kayak.[80]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[75] Note 57.\r\n\r\n[76] Note 58.\r\n\r\n[77] Note 59.\r\n\r\n[78] Note 60.\r\n\r\n[79] Bancroft, History of Alaska, p. 79, presents the same view: \"The\r\nidentity of Kayak is established by comparing Bering's with Cook's\r\nobservations, which would be enough even if the chart appended to\r\nKhitroff's journal had not been preserved. At first both Cook and\r\nVancouver thought it Yakutat Bay, which they named after Bering, but\r\nboth changed their minds. As late as 1787 the Russian Admiralty college\r\ndeclared that the island Chukli (Montague of Vancouver) was the point\r\nof Bering's discovery, but Admiral Sarycheff, who examined the journals\r\nof the expedition, pointed at once to Kayak Island as the only point to\r\nwhich the description of Bering and Steller could apply. Sarycheff made\r\none mistake in applying the name of Cape St. Elias to the nearest point\r\nof the mainland called Cape Suckling by Cook.\"--TR.\r\n\r\n[80] Note 61.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n  EXPLORATIONS ALONG THE AMERICAN COAST.--STELLER'S CENSURE OF BERING\r\n    FOR UNDUE HASTE.--BERING DEFENDED.--DALL, THE AMERICAN WRITER,\r\n    REPRIMANDED.--THE RETURN VOYAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is by no means an easy matter to form an unbiased opinion of\r\nBering's stay off Kayak Island. Steller is about our only authority,\r\nbut just at the point where it is most difficult to supplement his\r\naccount, he gives vent to most violent accusations against the\r\nmanagement of the expedition from a scientific standpoint. On the 16th\r\nof July, when land was first seen, he says: \"One can easily imagine\r\nhow happy all were to see land. No one failed to congratulate Bering,\r\nas chief of the expedition, to whom above all others the honor of\r\ndiscovery belonged. Bering, however, heard all this, not only with\r\ngreat indifference, but, looking toward land, he even shrugged his\r\nshoulders in the presence of all on board.\" Steller adds that on\r\naccount of this conduct charges might have been preferred against him\r\nin St. Petersburg, had he lived.\r\n\r\nAs Bering during the first few succeeding days did not make any\r\npreparations for a scientific exploration of the country, as he even\r\ntried, according to Steller's assurance, to dissuade the latter from\r\nmaking the island a visit, and as Steller only through a series of\r\noaths and threats (for thus p. 30 must undoubtedly be interpreted)\r\ncould obtain permission to make, without help or even a guard for\r\nprotection, a short stay on the island, his anger grew to rage, which\r\nreached its culmination on the following morning when Bering suddenly\r\ngave orders that the St. Peter should leave the island. \"The only\r\nreason for this,\" he says, \"was stupid obstinacy, fear of a handful\r\nof natives, and pusillanimous homesickness. For ten years Bering had\r\nequipped himself for this great enterprise; the explorations lasted\r\nten hours!\" Elsewhere he says derisively that they had gone to the New\r\nWorld \"simply to bring American water to Asia.\"\r\n\r\nThese accusations must seem very serious to every modern reader.\r\nUnfortunately for Bering, his second voyage is of interest principally\r\nfrom the standpoint of natural history. It is especially naturalists\r\nthat have studied it. They are predisposed to uphold Steller. Hence\r\nhis account threatens wholly to undermine Bering's reputation, and\r\nas a matter of course, W. H. Dall, in discussing this subject, finds\r\nopportunity to heap abuse upon Bering. He says: \"On the 18th of July,\r\nBering saw land. On the 20th he anchored under an island. Between\r\ntwo capes, which he called St. Elias and St. Hermogenes, was a bay\r\nwhere two boats were sent for water and to reconnoitre. * * * With\r\ncharacteristic imbecility, Bering resolved to put to sea again on the\r\nnext day, the 21st of July. Sailing to the northward, the commander\r\nwas confused among the various islands, and sailed hither and thither,\r\noccasionally landing, but making no explorations, and showing his total\r\nincapacity for the position he occupied. He took to his bed, and\r\nLieutenant Waxel assumed charge of the vessel.\"[81]\r\n\r\nThis is not writing history. It is only a series of errors and\r\nincivilities. It was _not_ the 18th of July that Bering first saw land.\r\nHe did _not_ sail north from Kayak, but southwest, and hence could not\r\nhave lost his course among islands, for here there are no islands. Nor\r\ndid he sail hither and thither, but kept the course that had been laid\r\nout, and charted the coasts he saw in this course. The most ridiculous\r\npart of this is what this nautical author tells of the bay between\r\nCape St. Elias and Cape St. Hermogenes (Marmot Island off the coast of\r\nKadiak Island), for these points are farther apart than Copenhagen and\r\nBremen. If, according to this writer, Bering was unpardonably stupid,\r\nhe must have been, on the other hand, astonishingly \"far-sighted.\"\r\nAfter these statements it will surprise no one that this author\r\nconsiders illness a kind of crime, and blames a patient, sixty years of\r\nage, suffering with the scurvy, for taking to his bed! If Mr. Dall had\r\ntaken the trouble to study the Bering literature to which he himself\r\nrefers in his bibliography of Alaska, he would have been in a position\r\nto pass an independent opinion of the navigator, and would certainly\r\nhave escaped making this series of stupid statements. His words now\r\nsimply serve to show how difficult it is to eradicate prejudice,\r\nand how tenacious of life a false or biased judgment can be. Death\r\nprevented Bering from defending and explaining his conduct. No one has\r\nsince that time sought to render him justice. I therefore consider it\r\nmy duty--even if I should seem to be yielding to the biographer's\r\nbesetting sin--to produce everything that can be said in Bering's\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, it must be remembered that on the 21st of\r\nJuly Bering had provisions left for no more than three months, and\r\nthat these were not good and wholesome. His crew, and he himself,\r\nwere already suffering from scurvy to such an extent that two weeks\r\nlater one-third of them were on the sick-list. Furthermore, he was\r\nover fifty-six degrees of longitude from his nearest port of refuge,\r\nwith a crew but little accustomed to the sea. The American coast in\r\nthat latitude was not, according to Bering's judgment, nor is it\r\naccording to our present knowledge, in any way a fit place to winter,\r\nand besides, he knew neither the sea nor its islands and depths, its\r\ncurrents and prevailing winds. All this could not but urge him to\r\nmake no delay. And, in fact, Steller himself expressly says that it\r\nwas a series of such considerations that determined Bering's conduct.\r\n\"Pusillanimous homesickness\" can scarcely have had any influence on a\r\nman who from his youth had roamed about in the world and lived half a\r\ngeneration in the wilds of Siberia. \"The good Commander,\" thus Steller\r\nexpresses himself, \"was far superior to all the other officers in\r\ndivining the future, and in the cabin he once said to myself and Mr.\r\nPlenisner: 'We think now that we have found everything, and many are\r\npregnant with great expectations; but they do not consider where we\r\nhave landed, how far we are from home, and what yet may befall us. Who\r\nknows but what we may meet trade winds that will prevent our return? We\r\nare unacquainted with the country, and are unprovided with provisions\r\nfor wintering here.'\"\r\n\r\nIt must be conceded that his position was one fraught with\r\ndifficulties. At this point there are two things which Steller\r\neither has not correctly understood, or suppresses. According to\r\nhis instructions, Bering was authorized to spend two years and make\r\ntwo voyages in the discovery of America, and to undertake another\r\nexpedition afterwards with new preparations and equipments. And in his\r\nexplanations to the crew he calls special attention to this point.\r\nUnder these circumstances it would not have been right in him to\r\nassume any more risks than absolutely necessary. But here again the\r\nold opposition between Bering's nautico-geographical and Steller's\r\nphysico-geographical interests breaks out. As a discoverer of the old\r\nschool Bering's principal object was to determine some elementary\r\ngeographical facts: namely, the distribution of land and water along\r\nthe new coast, and hence he left Kayak Island, not to reach Avacha\r\nas soon as possible, but to follow the coast of the newly discovered\r\ncountry toward the west and north. All authorities agree on this\r\npoint. It was illness and the Aliaska peninsula, projecting so far\r\ninto the ocean as it does, that prevented him from sailing up toward\r\nlatitude 65°, his real goal. Even Steller testifies to this, and\r\nalthough he repeats his former accusations against Bering, it does\r\nnot signify anything, as he was excluded from the councils and was\r\nobliged to guess at what was adopted. His accusations are especially\r\ninsignificant from the fact that he definitely contradicts himself on\r\nthis point, for later on in his narrative he says that not until the\r\n11th of August was it resolved, on account of the approaching autumn\r\nand the great distance from home, to start immediately on the return\r\nvoyage to Kamchatka. That is to say, they had not then made a start.\r\nUntil the 11th of August, for three weeks after their departure from\r\nKayak, Bering pursued his task of nautical discovery along the new\r\ncoast, and it would seem that he can be blamed for nothing more than\r\nconsidering this work of the expedition more important than that of the\r\nphysico-geographical investigation which Steller represented. This was\r\nbut natural. It was merely accidental that Steller accompanied Bering,\r\nand through him the expedition received a modern cast, which was not\r\nat all designed, and which Bering desired to make use of only under\r\nfavorable circumstances. We may regret his haste, and we may especially\r\nregret the fact that so keen and clever a naturalist as Steller did\r\nnot get an opportunity to explore the regions west of Mount St. Elias\r\nbefore European trade and white adventurers put in an appearance; but\r\nit hardly seems a question of doubt whether anyone for that reason has\r\na right to make accusations against the chief of the expedition.\r\n\r\nIt was very early on the morning of July 21 that the chief suddenly,\r\nand contrary to his custom, appeared on deck and gave the command to\r\nweigh anchor and stand out to sea. In doing this he set aside his\r\ninstructions from headquarters to act in accordance with the ship's\r\ncouncil. He acted as a sovereign chief, and notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat both of his lieutenants thought it wrong to leave the newly\r\ndiscovered coast without an adequate supply of water, he overruled all\r\nobjections and informed them that he assumed all responsibility for\r\nhis conduct. He was convinced of the entire necessity of it, he said,\r\nand thought it unsafe to remain longer in this exposed anchorage. Time\r\ndid not permit him to go in search of the harbor found by Khitroff on\r\nthe day previous, and there was moreover a seaward breeze. One fourth\r\nof the water-casks remained unfilled.\r\n\r\nBefore a strong east wind, the St. Peter on that day made fifty miles\r\non a southwesterly course. During the two succeeding days, he continued\r\nin this general direction. It was misty, and the coast was invisible,\r\nbut the sounding-line continued to show a depth of from forty to fifty\r\nfathoms. In a council, concerning the deliberations of which Steller\r\nhas a very confused and incorrect account, it was decided, on July 25,\r\nto sail slowly towards Petropavlovsk and, at intervals as wind and\r\nweather permitted, to head for the north and west, in order to explore\r\nthe coast they had left.\r\n\r\nThey continued on their southwesterly course, and on the next morning,\r\nJuly 26, they were off the Kadiak archipelago. In a latitude of\r\n66° 30', and about sixteen miles toward the north, they saw a high\r\nand projecting point, which Bering called St. Hermogenes, in honor\r\nof the patron saint of the day. He thought that this point was a\r\ncontinuation of the continent they had left behind them, and as such\r\nit is represented on both Müller's and Krasilnikoff's manuscript\r\nmaps in the archives of the Admiralty. On his third voyage, Cook\r\nexplored the Kadiak group, which he too had assumed to be a part\r\nof the mainland. He now found that Bering's promontory was a small\r\nisland east of Afognak, but out of respect for Bering, he retained the\r\noriginal name. Krusenstern also calls it St. Hermogenes Island, but\r\nlater the Russians changed it to Euratchey Island, on account of the\r\ngreat number of marmots there, and since the United. States came into\r\npossession of it, the name has been translated, and it is now known as\r\nMarmot Island.[82] Steller has not a single word in his diary about\r\nSt. Hermogenes, and besides, his account at this point is full of\r\ninaccuracies.\r\n\r\n\"Consequently, until July 26,\" he says, \"we sailed along the coast, as\r\nthese gentlemen thought it was necessary to follow it, while it would\r\nhave been sufficient, at intervals of a hundred versts, to have sailed\r\na degree or two toward the north.\" He thus blames them for not having\r\nfollowed the method which at about that time they had agreed upon, and\r\nlater did follow. His story of their having, for the first five days,\r\nsailed along the coast, simply proves, in connection with a series of\r\nother incidents in his work, that things were not entered in his diary\r\ndaily, but written down later from memory; hence its value as proof is\r\nconsiderably diminished.\r\n\r\nAlong the southeastern coast of Kadiak the voyage was very dangerous.\r\nThe average depth was twenty-five fathoms; the water was very roily,\r\nthe weather heavy with fog and rain, and the wind violent. Not until\r\nthe 31st of July was the weather clear enough for an observation, when\r\nthey found themselves in a latitude of 54° 49', and had passed the\r\nKadiak archipelago.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the plan adopted, they here veered to the northwest\r\nto seek the mainland for the purpose of determining its trend. On\r\nthe night of August 1 (and 2), they suddenly approached land, having\r\nonly four fathoms of water below the keel. There was a heavy fog,\r\nno wind, and a swift current, but they succeeded in shifting about\r\nand getting out into eighteen fathoms of water, where they anchored\r\nto await daybreak. In the morning, at eight o'clock, a small island\r\nwas seen at a distance of four miles. It was three miles long, with\r\nan east to west trend. A long reef extended out into the sea from\r\nthe eastern point, seen by them in a direction E. S. E. by E. In the\r\nevening they weighed anchor, having a heavy fog, and on the next\r\nmorning, the island was seen at a distance of seven geographical miles\r\ntoward the south. Its latitude was calculated as 55° 32', but as all\r\nof Bering's determinations of latitude on his return voyage from\r\nAmerica show an error of from 30' to 45' less than the true latitude,\r\nit must be concluded that the island was in latitude 56° and some\r\nminutes. He called the island St. Stephen from the calendar day, but\r\nhis crew or lieutenants must have called it Foggy Island (Tumannoi),\r\nas even Krasilnikoff's manuscript map, in the possession of the\r\nAdmiralty, has this name. Later the cartography of this region became\r\nconsiderably confused. The name St. Stephen disappeared. Cook called\r\nanother island Fog Island, while it became customary to consider the\r\nisland discovered by Bering as identical with Ukamok (Chirikoff Island,\r\nVancouver's Island), where the Russians had a colony, and thus the\r\nisland itself was finally lost to geography. Notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat Admiral Krusenstern, in a clever essay, has given an able review\r\nof the literature pertaining to this question, and has shown that where\r\nBering saw St. Stephen, Cook, Sarycheff, and Vancouver likewise saw an\r\nisland, different from Ukamok, and regardless of the fact that for\r\nthese reasons he restored St. Stephen on his map, Lieutenant Sokoloff,\r\nwho most recently, in Russian literature, has treated Bering's voyage\r\nto America, has wholly disregarded Krusenstern's essay, and says\r\nthat St. Stephen is identical with Ukamok. Sokoloff's essay is very\r\nsuperficial, and, compared with Krusenstern's weighty reasons, is based\r\non mere supposition. But, although the map of the North Pacific, in\r\nthe Russian Admiralty (1844), has a Tumannoi Island (that is, Foggy\r\nIsland, St. Stephen) somewhat northeast of Ukamok, it must be admitted\r\nthat, until the United States undertakes a new and careful survey of\r\nthe Aliaska peninsula and its southern surroundings, this question\r\ncan not be thoroughly decided, probable as it may be that Bering and\r\nKrusenstern are both right.\r\n\r\nAugust 3, the voyage was continued toward the northwest. In a latitude\r\nof 56° (according to Steller) they saw the high snow-capped mountain\r\npeaks of the Aliaska peninsula in a direction N. N. W. by W., but on\r\naccount of stormy and foggy weather they sought, with an easterly wind,\r\nto get back into their main course. Thus they reached, August 4, the\r\nJefdokjejefski Islands in a direction S. S. E. 3/4 by E., at a distance\r\nof twenty miles from 55° 45' N. These form a group of seven high and\r\nrocky islands, which on Russian maps still bears the same name, but in\r\nWest Europe this name has been displaced, and they are usually called\r\nthe Semidi, or Semidin, Islands, the name of the largest of the group.\r\n\r\nOn August 7, they found themselves south of the Jefdokjejefski Islands.\r\nBut now misfortunes began to pour in upon them. They encountered\r\nadverse winds which continued with but few interruptions during the\r\nsucceeding months. The St. Peter was tossed about on the turbulent\r\nand unfamiliar waters of the Aleutian archipelago, where the crew\r\nexperienced an adventure so fraught with suffering and dire events\r\nthat it is quite beyond compare in the history of discoveries. At the\r\nsame time, the scurvy got the upper hand. Bering had a severe attack\r\nwhich rendered him unfit for service. With his illness the bonds of\r\ndiscipline were relaxed. Under these circumstances there was called,\r\non the 10th of August, an extraordinary council, in which all the\r\nofficers participated. At this meeting it was finally decided to give\r\nup the charting of the American coast, and immediately start out upon\r\nthe direct route homeward on parallel 52°, the latitude of Avacha. The\r\nwhole crew, from the highest to the lowest, signed this resolution.\r\nThe facts taken into consideration were that September had been fixed\r\nas the extreme limit of time within which to return home, and that\r\nthey were then in the middle of August. Avacha was at least 1600 miles\r\ndistant, autumn was at hand with dark nights and stormy weather, and\r\nsixteen of the crew were already sick with the scurvy.\r\n\r\nWith a strong head-wind, in raw and foggy weather, and now and then\r\novertaken by fierce storms, they worked their way slowly along\r\nuntil the 27th of August. The condition of affairs on board had\r\ngrown continually worse, when it was finally announced that through\r\ncarelessness and irregularity the supply of water had been reduced to\r\ntwenty-five casks, a quantity that could not possibly suffice for\r\nthe 1200 miles which, according to their calculations, yet remained.\r\nHence it was necessary once more to find land to take in water, and\r\non the 27th the St. Peter's prow was again headed for Aliaska. They\r\nsailed north one degree and a half, and after a lapse of three days\r\nthey reached a multitude of high islands, behind which the coast of the\r\nmainland arose in the distance.\r\n\r\nAugust 30, the St. Peter lay at anchor off the Shumagins, a group of\r\nthirteen treeless, barren, and rocky islands near the coast of Aliaska.\r\nThe journal gives their situation as latitude 54° 48' N. and longitude\r\n35° 30' E. from Avacha. While the latitude as here determined has the\r\nusual error, referred to several times before, the longitude has an\r\nerror of 6-1/2°. Among these islands the first death on board occurred.\r\nIt was the sailor Shumagin, who, on the 30th, died in the hands of\r\nhis mates as they were taking him ashore. The islands were named in\r\nhonor of him. On the whole the situation was most deplorable. Bering\r\nhad fallen away so much in his illness that he could not stand, and\r\nthe others that were sick were carried ashore, and lay scattered along\r\nthe coast, giving this a very sad and sorrowful aspect. Confusion and\r\nuncertainty grew apace, as those in command could not maintain their\r\nauthority. Waxel and Khitroff, the highest in command, bandied words,\r\nwhereas the situation demanded firmness and vigor. The only one that\r\npreserved any manner of self-possession and forethought was Steller.\r\nHe immediately went ashore, examined the vegetation of the island,\r\nand collected a large number of anti-scorbutic plants, especially\r\nscurvy-grass and berries, with which, in the course of a week, he\r\nsucceeded in restoring Bering to sufficient strength to be able to use\r\nhis limbs. Through the use of the same remedies the other sufferers\r\nwere relieved. But Steller thought also of the future. The medicine\r\nchest contained \"plasters and salves for half an army,\" but only\r\nextremely few real medicines, and hence he suggested to Lieut. Waxel,\r\nwho was then in command, that he send a number of sailors ashore to\r\ngather anti-scorbutic plants, but this excellent and timely advice was\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Steller used all his influence to procure good water. He\r\nwent ashore with the sailors for this purpose, and as they began to dip\r\nwater from the first pool they found, one, too, which was connected\r\nwith the sea during high tide, he directed them to fresh springs a\r\nlittle farther in the interior, but the crew sent some samples on\r\nboard, and from there came the report that the water was good enough.\r\nThus it was that a new cause of disease--in spite of Steller's\r\nprotestations--was added to all the others. The water was brackish, and\r\non standing in the casks became unfit for use.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the stay at the Shumagins, which was unnecessarily\r\nprolonged, was very unfortunate. The St. Peter lay at anchor south of\r\nthem in a very exposed position. On the evening of August 29, a fire\r\nwas seen on one of the islands, and on this account, Khitroff wished to\r\nexplore them more thoroughly, although Waxel firmly opposed releasing\r\nboth of the ship's boats under the present dangerous circumstances.\r\nBy applying to Bering, who was in the cabin, and hardly understood\r\nthe situation, Khitroff had his way, and left the ship with the yawl\r\nand five men. He was gone four days, during which time the St. Peter\r\nwas forced to lie at anchor, while a favorable east wind might have\r\ncarried them several hundred miles toward home. The yawl was dashed to\r\npieces off one of the neighboring islands, and no more came from the\r\nexpedition than that Lieutenant Waxel, under great difficulty, found\r\nit necessary to rescue the six shipwrecked adventurers. Moreover,\r\nthey experienced a somewhat uninteresting clash with the Innuit\r\n(Esquimo)[83] inhabitants of the Aliaska peninsula, of which Müller and\r\nSteller both give a detailed account.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[81] Note 62.\r\n\r\n[82] Note 63.\r\n\r\n[83] For a full description of these people see H.

The weather was very bad, with\r\nalternating fogs, mist, and storms. A west wind prevailed almost\r\ncontinuously. Now and then a regular hurricane crossed their course.\r\nIf occasionally they had a favorable breeze, it seemed to last but\r\na few hours. \"I know no harder, more fatiguing life,\" says one of\r\nthe St. Peter's officers, \"than to sail an unknown sea. I speak from\r\nexperience, and with truth can say that during the five months I spent\r\non this voyage, without seeing any place of which the latitude and\r\nlongitude had been fixed, I did not have many hours of quiet sleep. We\r\nwere in constant danger and uncertainty.\"\r\n\r\nAs a last resort, they even thought of returning to America, or of\r\nreaching Japan. For several days they were swept along by a storm.\r\nSeptember 23, the second death occurred, and on the 24th they again\r\nsaw, to their great astonishment, land toward the north. They were\r\nthen on about the 51st parallel. They were of the opinion that they\r\nwere fourteen degrees from the Shumagins, and supposed that they were\r\n21° 39' from Avacha, which of course was very erroneous, for they were\r\nin the vicinity of the present Atka. As they saw behind the islands a\r\nhigh, snow-capped mountain, which, from the calendar day, they called\r\nSt. Johannes, they supposed the land to be a continuation of the\r\nAmerican continent.\r\n\r\nDuring the next seventeen days, from the 25th of September until the\r\n11th of October, they carried their lower sails only, and were driven\r\nby a stormy west wind five degrees toward the southeast to a latitude\r\nof 48°. \"The wind,\" says Steller, \"seemed as if it issued forth from\r\na flue, with such a whistling, roaring and rumbling, that we expected\r\nevery moment to lose mast and rudder, or to see the ship crushed\r\nbetween the breakers. The dashing of a heavy sea against the vessel\r\nsounded like the report of a cannon, and even the old, experienced\r\nmate, Andreas Hesselberg, assured us that during a sailor's life of\r\nfifty years he had not before seen such a sea.\" No one was able to\r\nstand at his post. The ship was at the mercy of the angry elements.\r\nHalf of the crew were sick and feeble, the other half well from dire\r\nnecessity, but were confused and distracted by the great danger. For\r\nmany days no cooking could be done, and all they had that was fit to\r\neat was some burned ship-biscuits, and even these were on the point\r\nof becoming exhausted. No one showed any firmness of purpose; their\r\ncourage was as \"unsteady as their teeth.\" The officers now and then\r\nthought of returning to America, but their plans changed as often as\r\nthe weather.\r\n\r\nDuring the first week in October it became very cold; heavy storms of\r\nhail and snow swept over the ship and made the work on board almost\r\nunendurable. On the 6th the ship's supply of brandy gave out, and, as\r\nthe storm from the southwest still continued to rage, Waxel seriously\r\nproposed to return to America and seek a harbor of refuge, as it would\r\nbe necessary in a few days, on account of the number on the sick list,\r\nto resign the ship to the mercy of the waves.\r\n\r\nBering, however, refused to entertain this idea, and exhorted the\r\ncrew to make an offering to the church--the Russians to the church in\r\nPetropavlovsk, the Lutherans to the church in Viborg, Finland, where\r\nBering had formerly resided.\r\n\r\nAs elsewhere on this whole voyage, Steller was here geographically\r\nconfused, and imagined that they were sailing in a latitude of 50-53°,\r\nwhile in reality they were on the 48th parallel, and hence his\r\ncomplaint that the officers would not sail to this parallel to get a\r\nbetter breeze, signifies nothing. Müller gives the correct position of\r\nthe ship when he says that on the 12th of October it was in latitude\r\n48° 18', but he too is wrong when he states that the weather did not\r\npermit them to make an observation, for just at this time they had\r\nfair weather and sunshine, and on the 11th, at noon, determined the\r\nlatitude as 48° 15' and the longitude as 27° east of Avacha. During\r\nthe succeeding ten days the weather was somewhat more favorable. Clear\r\nweather, with heavy frosts, prevailed; some hail and snow fell, but\r\nnevertheless they succeeded in making ten degrees on the parallel of\r\n49° 30'. The condition on board was getting much worse. Poor water,\r\nlack of bread and spirits, the cold and wet, vermin and anxiety,\r\nundermined the last remnants of their powers of resistance. On the 19th\r\nthe grenadier Kisseloff, on the 20th the servant Charitonoff, and on\r\nthe 21st the soldier Luka Savjaloff, died. Even men apparently well\r\nwere unable to stand at their posts from sheer want and exhaustion.\r\n\r\nThen the water supply threatened to give out. They had but fifteen\r\ncasks of water, a part of which was very poor. Waxel was again thinking\r\nof searching for land toward the north, when a strong wind carried\r\nthem so far westward that they supposed they had passed all traces of\r\nAmerican regions. They then determined to keep their course on the 52°\r\nof latitude, but on the following day, to their great astonishment,\r\nthey sighted the Aleutian Islands and made some new discoveries. On\r\nOctober 25, at a distance of 8-1/2 geographical miles toward the\r\nnorthwest, they saw a high, snow-capped island, which they called St.\r\nMarcus. By an observation at noon its latitude was found to be 50° 50',\r\nbut as this island is our Amchitka, and as its southern extremity,\r\naccording to Admiral Sarycheff, is in a latitude of 51° 35', it is\r\nevident that the St. Peter's determinations of latitude were constantly\r\nfrom one-half to three-fourths of a degree less than the true\r\nlatitude. Later this fact had an extremely unfortunate effect on their\r\nresolutions. On October 28, Kiska, which Bering called St. Stephen,\r\nwas discovered, besides three (in reality four) smaller islands east\r\nof it, and, carried along toward the north by a southwesterly wind,\r\nthey sighted, on the morning of the 29th, some low islands, which are\r\nsupposed to have been the present Semichi Islands, situated east of\r\nAttu. These islands, which to them appeared as one, were called St.\r\nAbraham Island. According to the ship's journal they were seen at ten\r\no'clock in the morning at a distance of six miles toward the west, and\r\nat noon ten miles in a direction W. S. W. It is evident that the St.\r\nPeter sailed north of these islands, but as the latitude on that day\r\nwas determined as 52° 31', at least 45' too far south, and as the ship\r\nundoubtedly on the 29th and 30th of October passed the Blizhni group\r\n(the Nearer Aleutians) it is more than probable that the strait between\r\nthe most westerly of the Semichi Islands and Attu was seen from the\r\nship's deck, although the officers do not mention this island in the\r\njournal, but simply indicate it on the chart. It is, however, referred\r\nto by both Müller and Steller. The most westerly of the Semichi Islands\r\nand Attu must be the former's Deception Islands. Steller applies all\r\nof his acuteness of mind to show that they were the first two Kuriles.\r\nNothing shows better than this assertion how confused Steller was;\r\nhence his unsparing attacks on Waxel, and his base insinuations,\r\nare not of the least moment. \"Betrayed and sold by two unscrupulous\r\nleaders,\" he says, \"we sailed, after October 31, in a northerly\r\ndirection from the 51st to the 56th parallel!\" How unreasonable! They\r\nwere, already on the 30th, north of the 53d parallel. A sharp southwest\r\nwind was blowing, several deaths were occurring daily, the helmsmen\r\nwere conducted to the wheel by companions so deathly sick that they\r\ncould scarcely walk, the ship's rigging and sails were fast giving\r\nway, the weather was raw and damp, the nights dark and long, and all\r\nattempts at the determination of latitude and longitude had about\r\nceased. Under these circumstances was it not worthy of all honor that\r\nWaxel was still able to hold the vessel up to the wind at all and\r\napproach the Commander Islands from Attu? In a short time the wind\r\nveered to the east, and on November 4 (Steller has it the 5th), in a\r\nlatitude calculated at 53° 30', they saw an elevated coast in the west\r\nat a distance of about sixteen miles. It is impossible to describe\r\nthe joy occasioned by this sight. The sick and half-dead crawled on\r\ndeck to see land once more, and all thanked God for their merciful\r\nrescue. Bering, almost completely exhausted, was greatly revived, and\r\nall thought of how they would rest and restore their health and vigor.\r\nHidden brandy casks were brought out, in order that by the Vodka's\r\nassistance they might properly celebrate the happy return. And in the\r\nfirst moments of their exultation even the officers rejoiced to think\r\nthat their calculations were not entirely wrong.\r\n\r\nAll were agreed that they were off the mouth of Avacha Bay, and in\r\nthe precipitous mountain sides of Copper Island they eagerly sought\r\nfor the promontories which mark the entrance to that bay. The channel\r\nbetween Copper Island and Bering Island was hidden to their view,\r\nhence they thought they had reached Kamchatka. When, a little later,\r\nthey saw through the mist the most northerly part of the strait, they\r\nwere for a short time not indisposed to believe that they were near\r\ntheir home harbor. But soon an intense feeling of doubt seized them.\r\nAccording to the ship's reckoning, they were yet forty miles from\r\nAvacha. An observation at noon informed them they were at least one\r\ndegree farther north than this place, and before evening came on, the\r\ncoast-lines assumed an appearance that compelled them to give up all\r\nthought of having reached home. But, as Bering on his first voyage\r\nhad not found land for several days' sailing east of the mouth of the\r\nKamchatka River, they still clung to the belief that they were off the\r\ncoast of the mainland. During the night, they stood to the north so as\r\nto steer clear of land, as they feared a storm. With great difficulty\r\nthe topsails were taken in, but the feeble crew were obliged to leave\r\nthe other sails. In the night a storm from the east rent the starboard\r\nshrouds of the mainmast so that it could no longer carry sail. The\r\nnext morning, a bright and magnificent November day, the whole crew\r\nassembled for a final consultation.\r\n\r\nAll that could walk or crawl, officers as well as crew, dragged\r\nthemselves into the chief's cabin to hear the result. I have repeatedly\r\ncalled attention to the fact that Bering did not have the sovereign\r\npower with which the chief of an expedition is now-a-days endowed. The\r\nterrible disease that had overpowered him still further lessened his\r\ninfluence; but never had the rules and regulations appeared in worse\r\nlight than on this occasion. Waxel and Khitroff, who had resolved to\r\nmake a landing, sought both before and during the meeting to induce the\r\ncrew to vote for this resolution; but Bering opposed it and put forth\r\nthe last remnants of his strength and energy to rescue the expedition.\r\n\"We have still the foremast,\" he said, \"and six casks of water. After\r\nhaving endured so much suffering and hardship, we must risk everything\r\nin order to reach Avacha.\" Waxel and Khitroff immediately endeavored\r\nto counteract the influence of this good advice, but the subordinates\r\nwere in doubt, and would not sign any resolution except on the\r\ncondition that the officers expressly assured them of the fact that the\r\nadjacent coast was Kamchatka. This Khitroff finally took upon himself\r\nto do, and so partly through compulsion and partly through persuasion\r\nthe lieutenants succeeded in securing a majority for their proposition.\r\nBut even yet Bering sought to save his convictions, and appealed to the\r\nreduced Lieutenant Ofzyn, who had had charge of the explorations from\r\nthe Obi to the Yenesei and was now serving as a sailor on board the\r\nSt. Peter; but as he immediately expressed his agreement with Bering,\r\nhe was in most abusive language driven from the cabin. Under these\r\ncircumstances Steller found it useless to support Bering. He confined\r\nhimself to certifying to the very great enervation of the crew. Before\r\nthe council adjourned, it was resolved to make for the coast, where the\r\nlieutenants, in an open bay, expected to find a harbor.\r\n\r\nBefore an easy northeast breeze, the St. Peter drifted toward the\r\ncoast, without helmsman or commander. The chief lay at death's door\r\nin his cabin, Waxel and Khitroff were seeking rest and quiet, and\r\nnot until the ship lay about four miles from land did Steller induce\r\nBering to order them on deck. They soon began to sound, and one verst\r\nfrom shore they cast anchor. Night came on with bright moonlight. The\r\nebb-tide receded over the rocky beach, producing heavy breakers. In\r\nthese the ship was tossed about like a ball, until finally the cable\r\nsnapped. They now expected to be dashed against the rocks at any\r\nmoment. The confusion became indescribable. In order not to have a\r\ncorpse on board, the dead bodies of two of their companions were thrown\r\noverboard. It had been the intention to take them ashore for burial.\r\nAt this juncture the second anchor was lost; but at the last moment,\r\njust as the third was on the point of being cast, Ofzyn succeeded in\r\nestablishing order and keeping the anchor on board. The vessel glided\r\nsafely across the reefs, and in a few moments the boatswain and Ofzyn\r\nwere able to anchor in a sheltered place. The St. Peter was safe for\r\nthe time being. In this still and bright November night (the night\r\nof Nov. 6, 1741) the ship was riding at anchor off the center of the\r\nnortheast coast of Bering Island, scarcely 600 yards from shore. Thus\r\nended this frightful adventure. Very fortunately, the ship had happened\r\nto strike the only navigable channel on the east that leads to the\r\ncoast of the island.\r\n\r\nIt yet remains to determine with more exactness the place of stranding.\r\nOn this point literature offers no reliable information. I am aware\r\nthat Steller says that the vessel stranded on the northern coast of\r\nthe island, but this is not to be taken literally. After the St. Peter\r\nhad passed the northern point of Copper Island, which lies parallel\r\nwith the trend of Bering Island, it was carried west and southwest\r\nby a northeasterly wind, and hence would strike the coast of Bering\r\nIsland off, or a few minutes north of, the northern extremity of Copper\r\nIsland. At this point the eastern coast of Bering Island recedes to\r\nthe west and forms that bay which the officers saw ahead. From this\r\nit is evident that the place where the vessel ran ashore was four or\r\nfive miles north of the present Cape Khitroff. In Waxel's journal the\r\ngeographical position is entered as 55° 5' north latitude, but Fr.\r\nLütke gives it as latitude 54° 58' and longitude 193° 23' west from\r\nGreenwich. On his large map of a part of the Aleutian Islands, with\r\nRussian and French text, he marks the place of landing at this point\r\nwith these words: \"_C'est près de cet endroit que le commandeur Bering\r\na fait naufrage_\"[84] (_i. e._, in the vicinity of this place Bering\r\nstranded). This place is at about the center of the eastern coast of\r\nthe island, which extends at least 28' farther north to Cape Waxel, and\r\nhence only from a local point of view, just as it must have seemed to\r\nSteller as the vessel approached land, can this receding part of the\r\ncoast be designated as the northern side of the island. The view here\r\nset forth is further corroborated by many places in Steller's diary,\r\nand by other accounts of the stay on the island.[85]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[84] Map III., Appendix.\r\n\r\n[85] My view has been most strongly confirmed by the excellent\r\nNorwegian naturalist, Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, Washington, who in the years 1882-'84 passed eighteen\r\nmonths on Bering island and circumnavigated it. In _Deutsche\r\nGeographische Blätter_, 1885, he describes his trip and gives a good\r\ncontour map of the island, as well as of Bering's stranding-place,\r\nwhich in honor of him is still called \"Komandor,\" and is situated\r\nin the place described above, on the northeastern coast of the\r\nisland.--_Author's Note to American Edition._\r\n\r\nFor Dr. Stejneger's final remarks on this point the reader is referred\r\nto Note 64, in the Appendix, where will be found a letter to the\r\ntranslator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n  THE STAY ON BERING ISLAND.--FAUNA OF THE ISLAND.--A RICH FIELD\r\n    FOR STELLER.--HIS DESCRIPTIONS IMMORTALIZE THE EXPEDITION.--THE\r\n    SEA-COW.--ITS EXTERMINATION.--NORDENSKJÖLD REFUTED.--PREPARATIONS\r\n    FOR WINTERING.--SAD DEATH OF BERING.--AN ESTIMATE OF HIS\r\n    WORK.--CHIRIKOFF'S RETURN.--THE CREW OF THE ST.

The snowless\r\nmountains of Plutonic rock, wild and jagged, arose perpendicularly\r\nout of the sea, and deep ravines with seething mountain streams led\r\ninto the treeless interior.[86] There was snow on only the highest\r\npeaks, and on this cold November night the coast appeared to the\r\nshipwrecked unfortunates in all its naked and gloomy solitude, and\r\nhence great was their surprise on landing to find the island teeming\r\nwith animal life, yet undisturbed by human habitation. The Commander\r\nIslands, as the group is now called, consist of two large islands and\r\na few rocky islets. The most easterly of the former is Copper Island\r\n(Mednie), about thirty-five miles long and three miles wide, covered\r\nwith high, steep, and jagged mountains, which lie athwart the main\r\ntrend of the island, S. E. to N. W., and terminate precipitously,\r\noften perpendicularly, with a narrow strand at the base scarcely fifty\r\nfeet wide. On a somewhat larger scale, the same description applies\r\nto Bering Island, which, according to Steller, is 23-1/2 geographical\r\nmiles long and nearly 3-1/4 wide. It is situated about 30 geographical\r\nmiles from Kamchatka, between latitude 54° 40' and 55° 25' north, and\r\nlongitude 165° 40' and 166° 40' east of Greenwich. Only on the west\r\ncoast, within the shelter of the Sea Lion Island (Arii Kamen) and a\r\nlesser islet, is there a fairly good harbor, where the Russians later\r\nfounded the only colony of the island, consisting of a few Aleuts who\r\ncultivate some vegetables, but maintain themselves principally by\r\nhunting and fishing. For this purpose they have built, here and there\r\non the east coast, some earth-huts which are used only temporarily.\r\nThe very high mountains, having a trend from N. W. to S. E., almost\r\neverywhere extend clear to the sea, and only here and there along the\r\nmouths of the brooks do semicircular coves recede from 700 to 1300\r\nyards into the interior. In Bering's day these coves or rookeries\r\ncontained a fauna entirely unmolested by human greed and love of chase,\r\ndeveloped according to nature's own laws, for which reason great\r\nscientific interest attaches to the stranding of the St. Peter. Of this\r\nanimal life Steller gives us in his various works descriptions which\r\nare unexcelled in power and fidelity. These have made Bering's second\r\nvoyage immortal. Naturalists will again and again turn to them. For\r\nthis reason it would seem that Steller had no ground for complaint that\r\nBering had taken him from his real field of investigation: Kamchatka--a\r\ncomplaint made in our day by O. Peschel--for on Bering Island he first\r\nfound that field of labor and that material, the description of which\r\nhas immortalized his name.[87]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STELLER'S TRIUMPHAL ARCH.]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Arctic fox, the higher fauna of these islands\r\nwere found exclusively among the sea mammals. The most important furred\r\nanimal at that time was the sea-otter (_Enhydra lutris_, Linn.), which\r\nlived in families on the coast during the whole year, especially,\r\nhowever, in the winter. Its velvety fur brought about 100 rubles on the\r\nChinese border, and hence this animal later became the object of a most\r\neager search. Nordenskjöld says these otters have been driven away, not\r\nonly from Bering Island, but also from other grounds, where formerly\r\nthey were slaughtered by the thousand. This statement, however, is not\r\nentirely correct. The sea-otter may still be found on Bering Island,\r\nand on the adjacent Copper Island (Mednie) it is frequently found,\r\nand is protected by just such laws as Nordenskjöld demands for its\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\nThe greatest number of marine animals here were found to belong to the\r\nfamily of eared seals (_Otariidoe_); namely, the sea-lion (_Eumetopias\r\nStelleri_), from which oil is obtained, and the fur-seal (_Callorhinus\r\nursinus_), which is still the world's most important fur-bearing\r\nanimal. Since the close of the last century, the Russian government\r\nhas with great care sought to protect this animal, and has built up a\r\nnational enterprise which yields a large annual income, and which makes\r\nit possible for the Russo-American company which has a lease of the\r\nbusiness, to kill annually about 30,000 seals and still increase the\r\nstock. On this point, too, Nordenskjöld's statements are unreliable\r\nand misleading. He puts the annual catch much too high, which, at the\r\ntime, caused no slight trouble between the Russian government and the\r\ncompany.[88]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it seems humiliating to West Europe that it is only\r\ndecried and tyrannical Russia that has understood how to protect this\r\nuseful animal. When Russian America, the present Alaska, in 1867\r\nwas sold to the United States, some of the best seal fisheries, the\r\nPribyloff Islands, were a part of the purchase. The United States has\r\nfound it profitable to retain the Russian regulations for seal hunting,\r\nfor those small islands alone yield the interest on the sum paid for\r\nthe whole territory.\r\n\r\nThe eared seals put in their appearance on the Commander Islands in the\r\nspring, and are found in the rookeries by the hundreds of thousands\r\nuntil August or September. They proved of the greatest importance for\r\nthe support of the shipwrecked expedition, and after the sea-otter for\r\na circuit of many miles had been driven away, they furnished a part of\r\nthe crew's daily means of sustenance.\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting animal on Bering Island was the sea-cow\r\n(_Rhytina Stelleri_),[89] a very large and ponderous animal from eight\r\nto ten meters long and weighing about three tons. It was related to\r\nthe dugong and lamantine of the southern seas, and the _manatus_ which\r\noccurs in Florida and along the Gulf coast. Its habitat seems to\r\nhave been confined to the shores of the Commander Islands, where it\r\nwas found in great numbers. Its flesh was very excellent food. Later\r\nit was eagerly sought after by the Siberian hunter, whose rapacity\r\nexterminated the whole species in less than a generation. The last\r\nspecimen is said to have been killed in 1768, and hence museums have\r\nbeen very unsuccessful in procuring skeletons of the animal. In his\r\n\"Voyage of the Vega,\" Nordenskjöld attempts to show that sea-cows were\r\nseen much later, even as late as 1854; but as he bases his assumption\r\nchiefly on the statements of some Aleutian natives, who, according\r\nto what Dr. Leonhard Stejneger recently has proved, confounded the\r\nsea-cow with a toothed whale (denticete), there seems to be no reason\r\nwhatever for modifying the results arrived at by Baer, Brandt, and\r\nMiddendorff.[90]\r\n\r\nWithout this animal wealth it would have gone hard with Bering's\r\nexpedition as it did later with the unfortunate La Pérouse, whose\r\nmonument has found a place in Petropavlovsk by the side of Bering's.\r\nIt would have been hopelessly lost on Bering Island. None of the\r\nparticipants would have seen Asia again, none would even have survived\r\nthe winter 1741-42, for when the St. Peter stranded, there were on\r\nboard only a few barrels of junk, a small quantity of groats, and some\r\nflour. The flour had been lying in leathern sacks for two years, and\r\nin the stranding had been saturated with turbid sea water, and hence\r\nwas very unfit for food. How fatal, therefore, Waxel's and Khitroff's\r\nopposition to Bering might have been.\r\n\r\nIt was the night between the 5th and 6th of November that the St. Peter\r\nreached this coast. On the 6th the weather was calm and clear, but\r\nthe crew were kept on board from weakness and work, and only Steller\r\nand Pleniser could go ashore with a few of the sick. They immediately\r\nbetook themselves to examining the country, and walked along the coast\r\non either side. Was this an island, or was it the mainland? Could\r\nthey expect to find human assistance, and could they reach home by\r\nland? After two days of exploration, Steller succeeded in satisfying\r\nhimself on these points, although it was nearly six months before he\r\ndefinitely ascertained that the place was an island. Unlike Kamchatka,\r\nthe country was treeless, having only a few trailing willows of the\r\nthickness of a finger. The animals of the coast were entirely new and\r\nstrange, even to him, and showed no fear whatever. They had no sooner\r\nleft the ship, when they saw sea-otters, which they first supposed to\r\nbe bears or gluttons. Arctic foxes flocked about them in such numbers\r\nthat they could strike down three or four score of them in a couple of\r\nhours. The most valuable fur-bearing animals stared at them curiously,\r\nand along the coast Steller saw with wonderment whole herds of sea-cows\r\ngrazing on the luxuriant algæ of the strand. Not only he had never seen\r\nthis animal before, but even his Kamchatkan Cossack did not know it.\r\nFrom this fact, Steller concluded that the island must be uninhabited.\r\nAs the trend of Kamchatka was not the same as that of the island, and\r\nas the flora was nevertheless identical, and as he moreover found a\r\nwindow frame of Russian workmanship that had been washed ashore, he was\r\nconvinced that the country must be a hitherto unknown island in the\r\nvicinity of Kamchatka.\r\n\r\nBering shared this view, but the other officers still clung to their\r\nillusions, and when Waxel, on the evening of the 6th, came ashore, he\r\neven spoke of sending a message for conveyance. Steller, on the other\r\nhand, began to make preparations for the winter. In the sand-banks,\r\nnear an adjacent mountain stream, he and his companions dug a pit and\r\nmade a roof of driftwood and articles of clothing. To cover up cracks\r\nand crevices on the sides, they piled up the foxes they had killed.\r\nHe exerted himself to obtain wild fowl, seal-beef, and vegetable\r\nnourishment for the sick, who were gradually taken ashore and placed\r\nunder sail tents upon the beach. Their condition was terrible. Some\r\ndied on deck as soon as they were removed from the close air of their\r\nberths, others in the boat as they were being taken ashore, and still\r\nothers on the coast itself. All attempts at discipline were abandoned,\r\nand those that were well grouped themselves into small companies,\r\naccording to their own pleasure and agreement. The sick and dying were\r\nseen on every hand. Some complained of the cold, others of hunger and\r\nthirst, and the majority of them were so afflicted with scurvy that\r\ntheir gums, like a dark brown sponge, grew over and entirely covered\r\nthe teeth. The dead, before they could be buried, were devoured by\r\nfoxes, which in countless numbers flocked about, not even fearing to\r\nattack the sick.\r\n\r\nMore than a week elapsed before the last of the sick were taken ashore.\r\nOn November 10, the Commander was removed. He was well protected\r\nagainst the influence of the outer air, and was laid for the night\r\nunder a tent on the strand. It snowed heavily. Steller passed the\r\nevening with him and marveled at his cheerfulness and his singular\r\ncontentment. They weighed the situation, and discussed the probability\r\nof their whereabouts. Bering was no more inclined than Steller to think\r\nthat they had reached Kamchatka, or that their ship could be saved. The\r\nnext day he was carried on a stretcher to the sand pits and placed in\r\none of the huts by the side of Steller's. The few that were able to\r\nwork sought to construct huts for all. Driftwood was collected, pits\r\nwere dug and roofed, and provisions were brought from the ship. Steller\r\nwas both cook and physician--the soul of the enterprise. On November\r\n13, the barrack to be used as a hospital was completed, and thither the\r\nsick were immediately removed. But still the misery kept increasing.\r\nSteller had already given up all hopes of Bering's recovery. Waxel,\r\nwho had been able to keep up as long as they were on the sea, now\r\nhovered between life and death. There was special anxiety on account\r\nof his low condition, as he was the only competent seaman that still\r\nhad any influence, since Khitroff, by his hot and impetuous temper,\r\nhad incurred the hatred of all. Moreover, those sent to reconnoiter,\r\nreturned with the news that in a westerly direction they could find\r\nno connection with Kamchatka or discover the slightest trace of human\r\nhabitation. It became stormy; for several days the boat could not\r\nventure out, and the ship, their only hope, lay very much exposed near\r\na rocky shore. The anchor was not a very good one, and there was great\r\ndanger that the vessel would be driven out to sea, or be dashed to\r\npieces on the rocks. The ten or twelve able-bodied men that were left,\r\nbeing obliged to stand in icy water half a day at a time, soon gave\r\nway under such burdens. Sickness and want were on every hand. Despair\r\nstared them in the face, and not until November 25, when the vessel was\r\ndriven clear ashore and its keel buried deep in the sand, did their\r\ncondition seem more secure. They then went quietly to work to prepare\r\nfor the winter.\r\n\r\nIn December the whole crew was lodged in five underground huts\r\n(dug-outs) on the bank of the stream near the place of landing.[91]\r\nThe ship's provisions were divided in such a way that every man daily\r\nreceived a pound of flour and some groats, until the supply was\r\nexhausted. But they had to depend principally upon the chase, and\r\nsubsisted almost exclusively upon the above mentioned marine animals\r\nand a stranded whale. Each hut constituted a family with its own\r\neconomical affairs, and daily sent out one party to hunt and another\r\nto carry wood from the strand. In this way they succeeded in struggling\r\nthrough the winter, which on Bering Island is more characterized by\r\nraging snowstorms (poorgas) than severe cold.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, death made sad havoc among them. Before they reached Bering\r\nIsland, their dead numbered twelve, the majority of whom died during\r\nthe last days of the voyage. During the landing and immediately\r\nafterwards nine more were carried away. The next death did not\r\noccur until November 22. It was the excellent and worthy mate, the\r\nseventy-year-old Andreas Hesselberg, who had plowed the sea for fifty\r\nyears, and whose advice, had it been heeded, would have saved the\r\nexpedition. Then came no less than six deaths in rapid succession;\r\nand finally in December the Commander and another officer died. The\r\nlast death occurred January 6, 1742. In all, thirty-one men out of\r\nseventy-seven died on this ill-starred expedition.\r\n\r\nWhen Bering exerted his last powers to prevent the stranding of the St.\r\nPeter, he struggled for life. Before leaving Okhotsk he had contracted\r\na malignant ague, which diminished his powers of resistance, and on\r\nthe voyage to America scurvy was added to this. His sixty years of\r\nage, his heavy build, the trials and tribulations he had experienced,\r\nhis subdued courage, and his disposition to quiet and inactivity,\r\nall tended to aggravate this disease; but he would nevertheless,\r\nsays Steller, without doubt have recovered if he had gotten back to\r\nAvacha, where he could have obtained proper nourishment and enjoyed the\r\ncomfort of a warm room. In a sandpit on the coast of Bering Island,\r\nhis condition was hopeless. For blubber, the only medicine at hand,\r\nhe had an unconquerable loathing. Nor were the frightful sufferings he\r\nsaw about him, his chagrin caused by the fate of the expedition, and\r\nhis anxiety for the future of his men, at all calculated to check his\r\ndisease. From hunger, cold, and grief he slowly pined away. \"He was,\r\nso to speak, buried alive. The sand kept continually rolling down upon\r\nhim from the sides of the pit and covered his feet. At first this was\r\nremoved, but finally he asked that it might remain, as it furnished him\r\nwith a little of the warmth he so sorely needed. Soon half of his body\r\nwas under the sand, so that after his death, his comrades had to exhume\r\nhim to give him a decent burial.\" He died on the 8th[92] of December,\r\n1741, two hours before daybreak, from inflammation of the bowels.\r\n\r\n\"Sad as his death was,\" says Steller, \"that intrepidity and seriousness\r\nwith which he prepared to meet death was most worthy of admiration.\" He\r\nthanked God for having been his guide from youth, and for having given\r\nhim success through life. He sought in every way possible to encourage\r\nhis companions in misfortune to hopeful activity, and inspire them with\r\nfaith in Providence and the future. Notwithstanding his conviction\r\nthat they had been cast upon the shores of an unknown land, he was\r\nnot disposed to discourage the others by expressing himself on this\r\npoint. On the 9th of December his body was interred in the vicinity of\r\nthe huts, between the graves of the second mate and the steward. At\r\nthe departure from the island there was placed upon his grave a plain\r\nwooden cross, which also served to show that the island belonged to\r\nthe Russian crown. This cross was renewed several times, and in the\r\nsixties, so far as is known, twenty-four men erected a monument to his\r\nhonor in the governor's garden (the old churchyard) in Petropavlovsk,\r\nwhere a monument to the unfortunate La Pérouse is also found, and where\r\nCook's successor, Captain Clerke, found his last resting place.\r\n\r\nWith Bering that mental power, which had been the life of these great\r\ngeographical expeditions and driven them forward toward their goal, was\r\ngone. We have seen how his plans were conceived; how through long and\r\ndreary years he struggled in Siberia to combine and execute plans and\r\npurposes which only under the greatest difficulties could be combined\r\nand executed; how by his quiet and persistent activity he endeavored\r\nto bridge the chasm between means and measures, between ability to\r\ndo and a will to do,--a condition typical of the Russian society of\r\nthat time. We have seen how he surmounted the obstacles presented by a\r\nfar-off and unwilling government, a severe climate, poor assistants,\r\nand an inexperienced force of men. We have accompanied him on his last\r\nexpedition, which seems like the closing scene of a tragedy, and like\r\nthis ends with the death of the hero.\r\n\r\nHe was torn away in the midst of his activity. Through his enterprise a\r\ngreat continent was scientifically explored, a vast Arctic coast, the\r\nlongest in the world, was charted, a new route to the western world was\r\nfound, and the way paved for Russian civilization beyond the Pacific,\r\nwhile enormous sources of wealth--a Siberian Eldorado--were opened\r\non the Aleutian Islands for the fur-hunter and adventurer. Russian\r\nauthors have compared Bering with Columbus and Cook. He certainly\r\nwas for Russia, the land of his adoption, what the two former were\r\nfor Spain and England--a great discoverer, an honest, hardy, and\r\nindefatigable pioneer for knowledge, science, and commerce. He led\r\nEurope's youngest marine out upon explorations that will ever stand in\r\nhistory as glorious pages, and as living testimony of what Northern\r\nperseverance is able to accomplish even with most humble means.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he only partly succeeded in accomplishing what for sixteen\r\nyears had been the object of his endeavors. His voyage to America was\r\nmerely a reconnoitering expedition, which, in the following summer, was\r\nto have been repeated with better equipments.\r\n\r\nChirikoff, who on the expedition in 1741, about simultaneously with\r\nBering,[93] discovered a more southerly part of the North American\r\ncoast, returned to Avacha in such an impaired condition that, in 1742,\r\nhe could undertake no enterprise of importance.[94] On account of\r\nthe great misfortunes that overwhelmed the expedition, Laptjef was\r\nprevented from completing the charting of Kamchatka. Thus we see that\r\non every side of Bering's grave lay unfinished tasks. These tasks\r\nwere inherited from the Dano-Russian explorer by his great successor\r\nCook, and other younger navigators. Moreover, his death occurred at\r\nan extremely fatal period; for in these same dark December days while\r\nBering was struggling with death in the sandpits of Bering Island,\r\nBiron, Münnich, and Ostermann lost their supremacy in St. Petersburg.\r\nThe Old Russian party, the opponents of Peter the Great's efforts at\r\nreform, came into power, and during Elizabeth's inert administration,\r\nall modern enterprises, the Northern Expedition among them, were\r\nallowed to die a natural death. At Avacha and Okhotsk affairs wore\r\na sorrowful aspect. The forces of the expedition had been decimated\r\nby sickness and death, their supplies were nearly exhausted, their\r\nrigging and sails destroyed by wind and weather, the vessels more or\r\nless unseaworthy, and East Siberia drained and devastated by famine;\r\nonly Bering's great powers of perseverance could have collected the\r\nvanishing forces for a last endeavor. On September 23, 1743, an\r\nimperial decree put an end to any further undertakings. Meanwhile,\r\nthe crew of the St. Peter had, in August, 1742, returned to Avacha\r\nin a boat made from the timber of the stranded vessel. Chirikoff had\r\npreviously departed for Okhotsk, to which place also Spangberg returned\r\nfrom his third voyage to Japan. Gradually the forces of the various\r\nexpeditions gathered in Tomsk, where, first under the supervision of\r\nSpangberg and Chirikoff, and later that of Waxel and other officers,\r\nthey remained until 1745. Thus ended the Great Northern Expedition.\r\n\r\nBut Bering's ill fate pursued him even after death. During the\r\nreign of Empress Elizabeth, nothing was done to make known the\r\nresults of these great and expensive explorations, nor to establish\r\nthe reputation of the discoverers. The reports of Bering and his\r\nco-workers, which make whole cartloads of manuscript, were buried in\r\nthe archives of the Admiralty. Only now and then did a meager, and\r\nusually incorrect, account come to the knowledge of the world. Some\r\nof the geographers of that day insisted that the Russian government\r\nsystem of suppression merely aimed at excluding the rest of Europe\r\nfrom that profitable maritime trade through the Arctic seas for which\r\nthe Northern Expedition had opened the way. Ignorance on this subject\r\nwas so great that Joseph de l'Isle ventured even before the French\r\nAcademy to refer to himself as the originator of the expedition,--to\r\nrob Bering of his dearly bought honor, and to proclaim to the world\r\nthat Bering accomplished no more on this expedition than his own\r\nshipwreck and death. With Buache he published a book and a map to\r\nprove his statements. The name De l'Isle at that time carried with\r\nit such weight that he might have succeeded in deceiving the world\r\nfor a time, if G. F. Müller had not, in an anonymous pamphlet written\r\nin French, disproved these falsehoods. But even Müller's sketch in\r\n_Sammlung Russischer Geschichte_ (1758), the first connected account\r\npublished concerning these expeditions, has great defects, as we have\r\nseen, not only from the standpoint of historical accuracy, but it also\r\nshows a lack of appreciation of the geographical results obtained by\r\nBering. Hence it would have been impossible for Cook to render the\r\ndiscoverer long-deferred justice, if he had not known D'Anville's map\r\nand Dr. Campbell's essay. Thus it was West Europe that last century\r\nrescued Bering's name from oblivion. In our day the Russian Admiralty\r\nhas had this vast archival material examined and partly published, but\r\nmuch must yet be done before a detailed account can be given of the\r\nenterprises we have attempted to sketch, or of the man who was the\r\nsoul of them all. We hardly feel disposed, with Professor Von Baer,\r\nto urge the erection of a monument in St. Petersburg, as a restitution\r\nfor long forgetfulness, former misjudgment, and lack of appreciation.\r\nAs Russia's first navigator and first great discoverer, he certainly\r\nhas merited such a distinction. We shall, however, consider our\r\ntask accomplished, if we have succeeded in giving in these pages a\r\nreliable account of the life and character of a man who deserves to\r\nbe remembered, not only by that nation which must ever count Vitus\r\nBering among her good and faithful sons, but also by the country that\r\nharvested the fruits of his labors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BERING'S MONUMENT IN PETROPAVLOVSK.\r\n\r\n(FROM WHYMPER.)]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[86] Dr. Stejneger, to whom the translator is indebted for various\r\nnotes and corrections of scientific interest, says: \"The mountains\r\nwhich Steller and his companions saw were not eruptive rocks. The\r\nwhole island consists of a more or less coarsely grained sandstone or\r\nconglomerate,--Plutonic rock cropping out only in isolated spots. The\r\nmountain streams of Bering island are anything but 'seething'; on the\r\ncontrary, they are as a rule very quiet.\"\r\n\r\n[87] Dr. Stejneger, ever on the alert to honor Steller, says in\r\n_Deutsche Geographische Blätter_, 1885: \"It was due to Steller that not\r\nonly a majority of the participants survived, but that the expedition\r\nwon a lasting name in the history of science. Bering left his name\r\nto the island upon which he died, and the group to which it belongs.\r\nKomandorski (Commander Islands), was named after his rank. Moreover,\r\nBering Sea, Bering Strait, a peninsula in Asia, and a bay in America\r\nhave been named in honor of him. But what is there in these regions\r\nto remind one of the immortal Steller, the Herodotus of these distant\r\nlands? Search the map of the island of which he has given such a\r\nspirited description. His name is nowhere to be found, while three\r\ncapes have received the names of Bering's lieutenants and helmsmen, who\r\nwere the authors of the whole misfortune: Waxel, Khitroff, and Jushin.\r\nThe man that rescued and immortalized the expedition has fallen into\r\noblivion. I consider it an honor that it has been granted to me to\r\nrender long deferred justice to this great German investigator. The\r\nhighest mountain peak on Bering's Island will henceforth be called\r\nMount Steller.\"\r\n\r\nIn speaking of a description by Steller of some rock formations on the\r\nwestern coast that resembled ancient ruins, Dr. S. says in the same\r\narticle: \"I landed at the only remaining one of these arches, under\r\nwhich Steller had probably walked. It is a fine specimen of a natural\r\ntriumphal arch, standing quite by itself. In honor of Steller I called\r\nit Steller's Triumphal Arch. No monument marks his resting-place on\r\nthe desert steppes of Siberia; Russia has never forgiven him for his\r\ningenuous criticism of the injustice of her courts; but Steller's name\r\nwill nevertheless live. His Triumphal Arch, gaily decked with the\r\nvariegated lichens _Caloplaca murorum_ and _crenulata_, and adorned\r\nwith the lovely white golden-eyed blossoms of the _Chrysanthemum\r\narcticum_, is a monument that does fitting honor to the great\r\nnaturalist.\"--TR.\r\n\r\n[88] Dr. Stejneger, in \"Contributions to the History of the Commander\r\nIslands,\" published in Proceedings of U.S. Nat. Museum, 1882, p. 86,\r\ncalls attention to Professor Nordenskjöld's erroneous statement, and\r\ngives the exact figures.--TR.\r\n\r\n[89] The correct name of this animal, Dr. Stejneger informs me, is\r\n_Rhytina gigas_.--TR.\r\n\r\n[90] Dr. Stejneger says, after a very careful and exhaustive discussion\r\nof this question: \"It may thus be regarded as fairly proved that the\r\nunknown cetacean, which in 1846 was observed near the southern end of\r\nBering Island, was a female narwhal. But, whatever it may have been,\r\none thing is absolutely sure: _it was not a sea-cow_!\" For references\r\nsee Note 65.--TR.\r\n\r\n[91] These pits or earth huts lay in a direction from north to south.\r\nNext to Steller's hut was the miserable pit in which Vitus Bering, a\r\nhundred and forty-eight years ago, drew his last breath. August 30,\r\n1882, Dr. Stejneger visited this place, of which he gives the following\r\ndescription in _Deutsche Geographische Blätter_, 1885, pp. 265-6: \"I\r\nwas first attracted to the ruins of the huts in which the shipwrecked\r\ncrew passed a winter a hundred and forty-one years previous. On a\r\nprojecting edge of the western slope of the mountain, in the northern\r\ncorner of the valley, stands a large Greek cross. Tradition says that\r\nBering was buried there. The present cross is of recent date. The old\r\none, erected by the Russian company, was shattered by a storm, but\r\nthe stump may still be seen. No one thought of erecting a new one,\r\nuntil Hr. von Grebnitski attended to the matter. Directly southeast\r\nof the cross, close to the edge of a steep declivity, about twenty\r\nfeet high, lie the fairly well preserved ruins of the house. The walls\r\nare of peat, about three feet high and three feet thick. They were\r\ncovered with a very luxuriant growth of grass, and, moreover, swarms of\r\nmosquitoes helped make investigation very unpleasant work. * * * The\r\nfloor was covered with a thick turf, the removal of which was out of\r\nthe question. I probed the whole surface with a bayonet, but nothing\r\nof significance was found. * * * A part of the crew were undoubtedly\r\nlodged in the sandpits under the barrow, of which Steller speaks. And\r\nin fact traces of the pits still exist, although they no longer have\r\nany definite form, being, moreover, so overgrown with vegetation that\r\nnothing could be ascertained from them. Some Arctic foxes had burrowed\r\nthere. At our approach the whole brood came out, and in close proximity\r\nstood curiously gazing at us. Steller and his companions are gone, but\r\nthe Arctic fox, which played them so many tricks, is still there. The\r\npits, now merely an irregular heap of sand filled with burrows, lie\r\nclose to the brook, where it curves sharply toward the west, cutting\r\ninto the declivity on which the house stands.\"--_Author's Note to\r\nAmerican Edition._\r\n\r\n[92] Old style\r\n\r\n[93] Bancroft, who, strange to say, calls Chirikoff \"the hero of this\r\nexpedition,\" gives a detailed account of the voyage of the St. Paul\r\nafter its separation from the St. Peter. Lauridsen does not do this,\r\nfor the obvious reason that he considers Chirikoff's expedition of but\r\ncomparatively little importance, although he doubtless would be willing\r\nto second Bancroft's estimate of Chirikoff as a man \"who, amongst\r\nRussians, was the noblest and most chivalrous of them all.\" There seems\r\nto be no reason to doubt that Chirikoff sighted the coast of Northwest\r\nAmerica about thirty-six hours before Bering did. On the 11th of July\r\nsigns of land were seen, and on the 15th land was sighted in latitude\r\n55° 21', according to Bancroft, who, at this point in his narrative,\r\nexclaims: \"Thus was the great discovery achieved.\" Chirikoff's return\r\nvoyage was fraught with hardships and suffering. Before the expedition\r\nreached Avacha Bay, October 8, twenty-one were lost. The pilot Yelagin\r\nalone of all the officers could appear on deck, and he finally brought\r\nthe ship into the harbor of Petropavlovsk. Croyère, the astronomer,\r\ndied as soon as he was exposed to the air on deck. Chirikoff, very ill,\r\nwas landed the same day. Eventful as the expedition in some respects\r\nwas, it nevertheless possesses no particular geographical or scientific\r\ninterest, for there is great doubt even as to where landings were made\r\nand what islands were seen. Bancroft speaks very cautiously on these\r\npoints. Sokoloff, however, declares emphatically that the land first\r\ndiscovered by Chirikoff was a slight projection of the coast between\r\nCapes Addington and Bartholomew of Vancouver's map. Moreover, the lands\r\nin these regions received no names from the St. Paul, whereas the\r\nSt. Peter forged, along the islands of the North Pacific, a chain of\r\nnames, many of which are still the permanent possession of geography.\r\nWhen it is furthermore remembered that Chirikoff was one of Bering's\r\nassistants, that the fitting out of the expedition was under the\r\ncharge of Bering, and that upon him rested all responsibility to the\r\ngovernment, it is certainly impossible for any fair minded person to\r\naccept the statement that Chirikoff \"must ever be regarded as the hero\r\nof this expedition.\" Bancroft does not, however, approve of Sokoloff's\r\nvainglorious expressions concerning \"the achievements of Chirikoff,\r\na true Russian, as against Bering the Dane.\" Principally in the one\r\nfact of a few hours' priority of discovery, Solokoff finds proof of\r\n\"the superiority of the Russians in scientific navigation!\" Bancroft\r\noccasionally reminds the reader that \"Russian historians are perhaps a\r\nlittle inclined to magnify the faults of Bering the Dane,\" and in this\r\ninstance administers to Sokoloff the following reproof: \"So the learner\r\nis often apt to grow bold and impudent and despise the teacher. The\r\ngreat Peter was not above learning navigation from Bering the Dane.\" In\r\nspeaking of Bering's death, Bancroft further retrieves himself--indeed,\r\nseems quite to supersede his former opinion--by saying: \"Thus passed\r\nfrom earth, as nameless tens of thousands have done, the illustrious\r\ncommander of the expeditions which had disclosed the separation of the\r\ntwo worlds and discovered north-westernmost America.\" See History of\r\nAlaska, p. 68 _et seq._--TR.\r\n\r\n[94] Note 66.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nBERING'S REPORT TO THE ADMIRALTY FROM OKHOTSK, DEC. 5, 1737.[95]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the instructions forwarded to me by His Imperial Highness, I\r\nlearn that the Imperial College of Admiralty is inclined to the\r\nopinion that the expedition is lingering along idly on account of\r\nmy heedlessness. This arouses in me no little anxiety for fear that\r\nI may incur undeserved wrath; yet in this matter I await the will\r\nof his Imperial Highness and the most gracious resolution of the\r\nImperial College. For although, from the time the expedition was put\r\nin my charge until the present time, I have faithfully and diligently\r\nsought as quickly as possible to build vessels, put out to sea, and\r\nbegin the execution of my work proper, everything has suffered delay\r\non account of unexpected obstacles over which I have had no control.\r\nPrior to our arrival in Yakutsk, not a single pood of provisions had\r\nbeen sent to Okhotsk for the crew there, not a single vessel had been\r\nbuilt for transporting these provisions and supplies, and not a single\r\nmagazine had been built at the stopping places on the Maya and Yudoma\r\nrivers. No laborers were to be had, and no arrangements whatsoever\r\nhad been made by the Siberian government officials, notwithstanding\r\nthe fact that an imperial ukase had ordered these things. We have\r\ndone all this. We built transports, demanded laborers from Yakutsk,\r\nand with great difficulty brought our provisions in these transports\r\nto Yudomskaya Krest,--yes, with superhuman efforts our command and\r\nthese laborers--since even upon my demand but very few were sent--also\r\nbrought the supplies at Yudomskaya Krest (12,000 poods of flour and\r\nrice) to Okhotsk. Moreover, at the stopping place on the Maya, at\r\nthe mouth of the Yudoma, at the Cross, and on the Urak, we erected\r\nmagazines and dwellings for the forces, and also built four winter-huts\r\nbetween Yudomskaya Krest and Urak as places of refuge during the\r\nwinter. Furthermore, in accordance with our plans, we built, in 1736,\r\nat the stopping place on the Urak, fifteen, and during this year, 1737,\r\nsixty-five vessels on which to float the provisions down the Urak. Of\r\nthese, forty-two are still at the place of construction, the remaining\r\nthirty-seven having departed with provisions in 1735. All of this has\r\nbeen done under my orders, not by the government officials of Siberia.\r\n\r\nIn Yakutsk, where I was at that time staying, we built two vessels,\r\nthe boat Irkutsk and the sloop Yakutsk, and in 1735 sent them out on\r\nthe expeditions assigned to them. We took pains to provision them\r\nwell, and furthermore sent four barges to the mouth of the Lena with\r\nadditional provisions for them. In 1736 the Yakutsk had the misfortune\r\nto lose its chief, Lieut. Lassenius, and many of the crew. Others\r\nwere hopelessly ill, and hence, as I feared that the work assigned to\r\nthis expedition would not be accomplished, I was obliged to man the\r\nvessel anew from Yakutsk. The sick were taken to Yakutsk to be nursed.\r\nI did all that was possible for them, and by the help of God they were\r\nsaved. For these same two ships I sent, in 1736, from the provisions\r\nof my command, two lighters with provisions, and during the present\r\nyear, 1737, I have likewise sent a boat to the mouth of the Lena, as\r\nthe provisions sent in 1735 were nearly exhausted. But from the voivode\r\nin Yakutsk we received no support whatever. From this it is evident\r\nthat my stay in Yakutsk was necessarily prolonged. Nor was it possible\r\nfor me to go to Okhotsk with my men until I had sent some provisions\r\nahead. Otherwise I should have taken the risk of starving them to\r\ndeath, putting an end to all hopes of accomplishing anything, and thus\r\nincurring a heavy responsibility. Some of my men remained in Yakutsk\r\nin charge of the affairs of the expedition there, and to forward\r\nprovisions. Others remained at the Maya harbor, Yudomskaya Krest,\r\nand at the Urak landing, to guard the magazines and attend to the\r\ntransportation of necessaries to Okhotsk, for it is not yet possible to\r\nfeed so many at Okhotsk. The fact that the voivode in Yakutsk made such\r\nlong delay in appointing commissioners to receive and send me supplies,\r\nprevented me from keeping my men together and availing myself of their\r\nassistance. As early as June 2, 1735, I demanded the appointment of\r\nthree commissioners and such assistants as I thought necessary, to be\r\nstationed along the route. The authorities at Yakutsk did not comply\r\nuntil the present year, 1737, and then only after repeated demands on\r\nmy part. But if I had neglected to attend to these matters, and had\r\nhastened the departure to Okhotsk, the voivode--in my absence--would\r\nhave done nothing, and it remains to be seen how the transportation\r\nto Yudomskaya Krest will be attended to. * * * As the difficulties\r\nwith which we have had to contend are very obvious, and although as a\r\nconsequence the immediate starting out of the expedition is improbable,\r\nI can, nevertheless, conscientiously say that I do not see how I could\r\nhave in a greater degree hastened the work of the expedition, or how\r\nI could have intensified the zeal with which I have worked from the\r\nvery beginning. Through this report I therefore most humbly seek at the\r\nhands of the Admiralty a considerate judgment, and hope that it will\r\nshow that matters have not been delayed through my carelessness.\r\n\r\nIt is on account of these obstacles, together with the fact that\r\nthere was much work to be done in Okhotsk, that I have been unable\r\nto prepare, in a short time, the ships necessary for the voyage. My\r\ncommand has had to work at Spangberg's ships, which are now ready.\r\nBut also in Okhotsk, on the \"Cat\" (Koschka), where these vessels and\r\npacket-boats are being built, everything was bare and desolate. There\r\nwas not a building there,--nowhere to stay. Trees and grass do not grow\r\nthere, and are not found in the vicinity on account of the gravel. In\r\nspite of the fact that the region is so barren, it is nevertheless\r\nvery well suited for ship-building. It is a good place for launching,\r\nfor starting out, and as a harbor of refuge for these ships. There is,\r\nin fact, no better place on this coast. Hence, according to Spangberg's\r\ndirections, a house was built on the \"Cat\" for the officers, and\r\nbarracks and huts for the men. For these buildings our men hauled the\r\nclay, made the tiles, brought wood from a distance of three to four\r\nmiles, and carried fresh water from a distance of about two miles; for\r\nalthough the Koschka is situated at the mouth of the Okhota, the water\r\nin the river is very salty on account of the tide-water. Moreover, we\r\nhave built storehouses and a powder magazine. I enclose three diagrams,\r\nshowing what has been done in the years 1735, 1736, and 1737. My men\r\nin Okhotsk are now preparing ship-biscuits for the voyages, and are\r\nfloating the necessary timber for the boats twenty miles down the\r\nriver. They burn the charcoal used in forging, and the necessary pitch\r\nmust be prepared and brought from Kamchatka, as there is no pitch-pine\r\nin the vicinity of Okhotsk.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this we are obliged to make our own dog-sledges, and\r\non these bring our provisions from Yudomskaya Krest to the Urak\r\nlanding. There is, too, much other work in Okhotsk that must be done in\r\npreference to ship-building, for it is quite impossible to get anything\r\nin the way of food except the legal military provisions, consisting\r\nof flour and groats. I must state, in this connection, that in the\r\nsummer some cattle are sent with the transports from Yakutsk. These are\r\nobtained at the regular price and are distributed among the crews; but\r\non account of the great distance, and the reluctance of the Yakuts to\r\nsell to others than the yassak collectors, except when in great need,\r\nthe supply has been limited.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that the authorities at Okhotsk were directed\r\nto prepare fish for the expedition, I found that nothing whatever had\r\nbeen done in this regard; but, on the contrary, they monopolized the\r\nsupplies of the Tunguses, who furnished my first expedition with an\r\nabundance of fish, and upon whom I had depended. For this reason we\r\nare forced to give the men leave of absence in the summer, so that\r\nthey may obtain food by fishing, thus causing a loss of time and\r\nneglect of the work of the expedition. Our force might be divided\r\ninto different parties, for ship-building, fishing, and miscellaneous\r\nwork, but we have not found it expedient to do this. Especially on\r\naccount of the fact that many have been assigned to the work of\r\ntransportation, there are not as many engaged in ship-building as\r\nnecessary, or as was ordered by the Imperial College of Admiralty.\r\nLack of sufficient provisions has prevented this. Here in Okhotsk we\r\nhave but a small number of laborers. The rest, for whom there will be\r\nno provisions until in the spring, we have sent to Yudomskaya Krest to\r\nbring provisions and other necessary supplies on dog-sledges to the\r\nUrak landing, and to construct at this place twenty new barges for use\r\nin the spring of 1738. New barges must be built every year, for those\r\nthat are floated down the Urak can not be returned on account of the\r\nswiftness of the current. They are, however, used for other purposes\r\nin Okhotsk. It takes four men ten days to build a barge, and four\r\nor five to man one. I most respectfully ask the Imperial College of\r\nAdmiralty to consider the number of men employed at this work, and what\r\nthey are accomplishing. All of this, too, is being done by my forces.\r\nFrom the government officer in Okhotsk, Skornjakoff-Pissarjeff, we\r\nhave not, since the day of our arrival here up to the present time,\r\nreceived the slightest assistance in transportation, ship-building,\r\nor anything else whatsoever. Nor have we any hope of obtaining any\r\nsuch assistance in the future. And even if we should demand support\r\nfrom him, we would only have long and fruitless negotiations with him,\r\nfor while in Yakutsk, he sent me a written notification (February 28,\r\n1737), refusing to assist in the transportation from Yudomskaya Krest\r\nto Okhotsk.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the facts here adduced, together with my earlier\r\nreports to the Imperial College of Admiralty, wherein I have given an\r\naccount of my efforts for the progress of the enterprise and shown\r\nthe impossibility of an early consummation of the main object of\r\nmy expedition, I appeal to the testimony of all the officers of my\r\ncommand. All of which is respectfully submitted.\r\n\r\n                                     BERING, _Commander_.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[95] Abridged from the Russian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Samuel Engel, Vaugondie, and Bushing tried\r\nto show that according to these Asia had been put too far east.

Cook and King: Voyage to the Pacific Ocean, III., 473: \"In justice\r\nto the memory of Bering, I must say that he has delineated the coast\r\nvery well, and fixed the latitude and longitude of the points better\r\nthan could be expected from the methods he had to go by. This judgment\r\nis not formed from Mr. Müller's account of the voyage or the chart\r\nprefixed to his book, but from Dr. Campbell's account of it in his\r\nedition of Harris's Collection and a map thereto annexed, which is\r\nboth more circumstantial and accurate than that of Mr. Müller.\" The\r\nchart which Cook refers to is a copy of Bering's own chart as given by\r\nD'Anville.\r\n\r\nConcerning East Cape, Cook says: \"I must conclude, as Bering did before\r\nme, that this is the most eastern point of Asia,\" p. 470.\r\n\r\n16. See Steller's various works, especially the introduction to the one\r\non Kamchatka, where it is stated that Bering returned \"_ohne doch das\r\ngeringste entdeckt zu haben_.\" This introduction was written by J. B.\r\nS. (Scherer).\r\n\r\n16. In Petermann's _Mittheilungen_, 1879, p. 163, Dr. Lindemann\r\nsays that Bering turned back \"without having seen, strange to say,\r\neither the Diomedes or the American coast.\" The author's authority is\r\nevidently W. H. Dall, an extremely unfortunate historian. The latter\r\nsays: \"Bering, naturally timid, hesitating, and indolent, determined\r\nto go no farther for fear of being frozen in, and returned through the\r\nStrait--strange to say--without seeing the Diomedes or the American\r\ncoast.\" See Dall: Alaska and its Resources.

Steller: _Beschreibung von dem Lande Kamtschatka_, p. 15. Steller\r\nsways back and forth between Müller's views and the account that\r\nhe himself obtained of the real state of affairs. He met Müller in\r\nWest Siberia in 1739, when the latter was filled with his supposed\r\nepoch-making discoveries in Yakutsk archives. In _Reise nach Amerika_,\r\np. 6, Steller says: \"_So verblieb es nichts desto weniger auf Seiten\r\nder damals gebrauchten Officiere bey einer kurzen Untersuchung des\r\nLandes Kamtschatka, von Lopatka bis zu dem sogenannten Serze Kamen,\r\nwelche bey weitem das Tschuktschiske Vorgebirge noch nicht ist._\" He\r\nhas so little knowledge of Bering's work that he can immediately go\r\non to say: \"_Gwosdew ist viel weiter und bis 66 Grad Norderbreite\r\ngekommen_.\"\r\n\r\n29. How varying the views on this subject have been even in the\r\nnarrowest academical circles may be seen from the following: In a\r\nGerman edition of _Atlas Russicus_, 1745, Serdze Kamen appears as a\r\nmountain in the center of the Chukchee peninsula. (By Calque, placed at\r\nmy disposal by A. Thornam, of St. Petersburg. In the French edition the\r\nname is not found at all.) On the maps which accompany J. E. Fischer's\r\n_Sibirische Geschichte_, 1768, and Ginelin's work, Serze Kamen and\r\nKammenoie Serdze are found, but in different places of Bering Strait,\r\nboth different from Müller's.\r\n\r\n30. Cook and King: Voyage, etc., I., 469: \"Thus far Bering proceeded in\r\n1728, that is, to this head, which Müller says is called Serdze Kamen\r\non account of a rock upon it shaped like a heart. But I conceive that\r\nMr. Müller's knowledge of these parts is very imperfect. There are many\r\nelevated rocks upon this cape, and possibly some one or other of them\r\nmay have the shape of a heart.\r\n\r\n\"At four in the morning the cape, which, on the authority of Müller, we\r\nhave called Serdze Kamen, bore S.

Philip Johann Tabbert, ennobled in 1707 and called Von\r\nStrahlenberg, was born at Stralsund in 1676, and taken captive after\r\nthe battle of Pultowa as captain in the army of Charles XII. He was\r\nbanished to Tobolsk, traveled some years with Dr. Messerschmidt in\r\nSiberia, and together with other Swedish officers he made several maps\r\nof Siberia, which, without his knowledge or consent, were published\r\nin Holland by Bentinck, 1726, in _L'Histoire des Tartares_, etc., and\r\nreprinted in various works such as _La Russie asiatique, tirée de la\r\nCarte donnée par ordre du feu Czar_. In 1730, Strahlenberg's own work\r\nappeared in Leipsic; it is marked by its minute knowledge of details.\r\nHis representation of the Chukchees peninsula deserves attention as\r\nevidence of the knowledge the Cossacks had of this region, whereas\r\nthere is nothing original in his representation of the coast-lines of\r\nEastern Asia. Baer says that Strahlenberg's book and map was made by\r\na Leipsic student, and that whatever it contains that is of value is\r\ntaken from Messerschmidt. _Beiträge_, XVI., 126. Note 18.\r\n\r\n34. This map is reproduced in Nordenskjöld's Voyage of the Vega.\r\n\r\n35.

Kiriloff's map is found in _Russici imperii Tab. Generalis et\r\nSpecialis_, Vol. XLIII.\r\n\r\n37. Strangely enough, no original copy seems to have remained in the\r\narchives of the Admiralty. Berch insists that no such copy exists. I\r\ninvestigated the matter in 1883, and later Mr. A. Thornam has examined\r\nthe archives for this purpose, but without result.\r\n\r\n38. Du Halde writes: _Ce Capitaine revint á Sct. Petersburg le premier\r\njour de Mars de l'année 1730, et apporta une relation succinte de\r\nson voyage, avec la Carte qu'il en avoit dressée. Cette Carte fût\r\nenvoyée au Sérénissime Roi de Pologne, comme une présent digne de son\r\nattention et de sa curiosité, et Sa Majesteté a bien voulu qu'elle me\r\nfût communiquée en me permettant d'en faire tel usage qu'il me plairot.\r\nJ'ai cru que le Public me scauroit quelque gré de l'avoir ajoutée à\r\ntoutes celles que je lui avois promises._\r\n\r\nIn the Swedish geographical journal, \"Ymer,\" 1884, there is an\r\ninteresting account by E. W. Dahlgren of the copies of Bering's chart\r\nin Sweden.\r\n\r\n39. Gmelin: _Reise durch Sibirien_. Introduction.\r\n\r\n40. Bering's proposition was formulated as follows: (1) As the waves,\r\naccording to my observation, are smaller east of Kamchatka [than in\r\nthe open ocean], and, moreover, as I have on Karaginski Island found\r\nlarge fir-trees washed ashore, which do not grow in Kamchatka, it is my\r\nopinion that America or some intervening land can not be very far from\r\nKamchatka (150-200 geographical miles). In case this is so, commercial\r\nrelations with that country that would be to the advantage of the\r\nRussian empire could be established. This matter can be investigated,\r\nif a vessel is built of from 45 to 50 tons burden. (2) This vessel\r\nought to be built at Kamchatka, as at this place more available timber\r\nis found than at other places [on the east coast]; moreover, provisions\r\nfor the crew, fish and other animals are easily obtained. Besides,\r\ngreater assistance can be obtained from the Kamchadales than from the\r\ninhabitants of Okhotsk. (3) It would not be without advantage to find\r\nout the sea-route from Okhotsk or Kamchatka to the mouth of the Amoor\r\nand farther on to the Japan Islands, as we there have hopes of finding\r\ninhabited regions. It would be well to establish commercial relations\r\nwith them, especially with the Japanese, which promises the Russian\r\nempire no small advantage in the future. For this purpose a ship of\r\nthe same size or a little smaller than the first might be built. (4)\r\nThe expenses of this expedition in addition to the salaries and the\r\nmaterials, which could not be secured there, but would have to be taken\r\nalong from here or Siberia, would, including the transport, amount to\r\nten or twelve thousand rubles. (5) If it is considered advisable to\r\nchart the northern coast of Siberia, especially from the mouth of the\r\nObi to the Yenisei and hence to the Lena, this can be done by sailing\r\ndown these rivers or by expeditions by land, as these regions are under\r\nRussian rule.\r\n\r\n                                                 VITUS BERING.\r\n  April 30, 1730.\r\n\r\nThese propositions were first published by Berch in \"The First\r\nRussian Admirals,\" and later reprinted by Sokoloff in _Zapiski\r\nHydrograficheskago Departamenta_ (Journal of Hydr.

When she, in the year\r\n1738, returned from Siberia, the Senate, influenced by the numerous\r\ndenunciations of her conduct, issued an ukase that her goods should\r\nbe examined. At the inspection on the borders of Siberia it was found\r\nthat she had a suspiciously large quantity of furs and other things.\r\nShe rather overawed the authorities, however, and returned to St.\r\nPetersburg unmolested. Sokoloff gives no information as to whether the\r\nfurs were illegally obtained or not. She was very much younger than\r\nBering; in 1744, on making application for a widow's pension, she gave\r\nher age as 39 years.\r\n\r\n44. The author is indebted to Admiral Th. Wessalgo for the following\r\narchival accounts.\r\n\r\n_The Admiralty to Captain Bering, Feb. 26, 1736._\r\n\r\n    Your expedition is a very protracted one, and apparently it\r\n    is being conducted somewhat carelessly on your part, which is\r\n    shown by the fact that it has taken nearly two years to reach\r\n    Yakutsk. Moreover, it appears from your report that your stay in\r\n    Yakutsk will be too long; in fact, there seems to be no reason\r\n    to hope that you will succeed in getting any farther. As a\r\n    consequence of all this the Admiralty is extremely dissatisfied\r\n    with your arrangements, and will not let matters go on without an\r\n    investigation. If in the future any negligence whatever occurs, an\r\n    investigation will be instituted against you for insubordination\r\n    to the decrees of His Imperial Highness and for negligence in an\r\n    affair of state.\r\n\r\n_The Admiralty to Captain Bering, Jan. 31, 1737._\r\n\r\n    Inasmuch as you--in spite of the express orders of the Admiralty,\r\n    wherein it is stated that your expedition is protracted and is\r\n    carelessly conducted--have not reported to the Admiralty the cause\r\n    of your delay, and say nothing about when you intend to leave\r\n    Yakutsk, you are hereby deprived of your supplemental salary, and\r\n    will receive only the regular salary, until you send such a report,\r\n    and until you continue on the expedition which has been entrusted\r\n    to you.\r\n\r\n_The Admiralty to Captain, Bering, Jan. 23, 1738._\r\n\r\n    From Captain Chirikoff there has been received by the Admiralty\r\n    a report from Okhotsk with an accompanying copy of a proposition\r\n    laid before you by Chirikoff, suggesting measures for a more speedy\r\n    completion of the Kamchatka expedition under your charge. As no\r\n    steps had been taken by you in this direction as late as May 8 of\r\n    the same year, the Admiralty has concluded to demand an answer\r\n    from you, if any plans have been made on the basis of Chirikoff's\r\n    proposition, and if, contrary to our expectations, nothing has been\r\n    done, we desire to know _why_,--since, according to the orders\r\n    issued to you Feb. 21, 1737, you were instructed to show zeal and\r\n    solicitude for the activity of the expedition, and that any neglect\r\n    on your part would make you liable to the same punishment as that\r\n    suffered by Lieutenants Muravjeff and Pauloff for negligence in\r\n    conducting expeditions entrusted to them.[96]\r\n\r\n    (These officers were reduced to the rank of ordinary sailors.)\r\n\r\n    According to Bering's reports there were engaged in the Great\r\n    Northern Expedition, excluding the Academists and the crew on the\r\n    White Sea expedition, the following number of men:\r\n\r\n              In the year 1737  1738  1739\r\n\r\n  From the Admiralty       259   254   256\r\n  From Siberia             324   320   320\r\n                           ---   ---   ---\r\n                  Total    583   574   576\r\n\r\n45. To an inquiry directed to the Russian Admiralty asking the reason\r\nfor Bering's long stay in Yakutsk, Admiral Th. Wessalgo has given me\r\nthe following information:\r\n\r\n\"In Yakutsk, which was the base of operations for the whole expedition,\r\nBering was to secure wood, iron, and other materials for the building\r\nof the necessary ships, and, what is most important, he was to secure\r\nprovisions, of which a yearly supply of 16,000 poods was necessary.\r\nAlthough the furnishing of provisions had been assigned to the Siberian\r\nauthorities, they did nothing, in spite of urgent and repeated demands;\r\nhence Bering had to undertake this work himself. Moreover, the immense\r\namount of materials and provisions collected here was to be sent to\r\nOkhotsk, a task which presented insurmountable obstacles: the country\r\nwas a wild and desolate region, the local authorities refused their\r\nco-operation in promoting the enterprise, there was constant contention\r\nand disagreement among the various officers in charge, who were more\r\nconcerned in their own personal interests than in the common weal, and\r\nBering himself--was a weak character.\"\r\n\r\n46.

Laptjef was to go from Kolyma\r\nto Anadyr and from there send word to Bering for a vessel or to go\r\nhimself to Kamchatka for it,--in either case he was to sail around\r\nthe northeast point of Asia, and reach the mouth of the Kolyma. When\r\nhe, in 1741, arrived at Anadyr, Bering had departed for America, and\r\nhence he could do no more than build some boats, by means of which he,\r\nin 1742, charted the lower course of the Anadyr, and returned in 1743\r\nto Yakutsk. _Zapiski_, etc.: IX., pp. 314-327.--_Beiträge_, XVI., pp.\r\n121-122.\r\n\r\n48.

But\r\nas this space is occupied, in the French charts, by that part of the\r\nsupposed Land of Jeso and Staten Island, Mr. Müller's opinion becomes\r\nextremely probable that they are all the same lands; and, as no reasons\r\nappear for doubting Spangberg's accuracy, we have ventured in our\r\ngeneral map to reinstate the Three Sisters, Zellany and Kunashir, in\r\ntheir proper situation, and have entirely omitted the rest.\"--Cf.

The pre-Bering explorations of Northwest America did not extend\r\nbeyond the northern boundary of California, and had not succeeded in\r\nascertaining a correct outline of the country. In the oldest maps\r\nof the new world, that of Ortelius (1570), Mercator (1585), Ramusio\r\n(1606), and W. Blaew (1635), California is represented as a peninsula;\r\nbut on the maps of later cartographers as W. Samson (1659), Wischer\r\n(1660), J. Blaew, Jansen (1662), Fr. de Witt (1666), and Nic. Samson\r\n(1667), the country is represented as an island, and this view was held\r\nuntil G. de L'Isle (1720) adopted in his atlas the old cartography of\r\nthe peninsula.\r\n\r\nGvosdjeff's expedition to Bering's Strait in 1732 is but slightly\r\nand very imperfectly known in West Europe. It was undertaken by\r\nIvan Fedoroff, Moschkoff, who had accompanied Bering on his first\r\nexpedition, and the surveyor Gvosdjeff. Fedoroff is thus the real\r\ndiscoverer of America from the east, and the world has given Gvosdjeff\r\nthe honor simply for the reason that the reports of Fedoroff and his\r\nassociate were lost and he himself died the year after. There is an\r\ninteresting account of this enterprise in _Zapiski_, etc., IX., 78.\r\n\r\n56. G. W. Steller: _Reise von Kamtschatka nach Amerika_. St.\r\nPetersburg, 1793.\r\n\r\n57. R.

Clans of the great Tinné tribe, Ugalenses, stay\r\nduring the summer on the Atna River, and during the winter on Kayak\r\nIsland; but on the coast of the continent from Ice Bay to the Atna\r\nRiver there are also found Innuits, the Ugalakmuts.--See Vahl: Alaska,\r\np. 39.

Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, under date of June 9, 1889, writes the\r\ntranslator: \"The locality indicated in Lütke's map is correct. It is\r\nconsequently on the eastern side of the island. Steller's statement\r\nthat it was on the northern side is easily explained as follows:\r\nThe valley where he landed opens toward the northeast, and the\r\ncorresponding valley on the other side of the island runs southwest;\r\nthis side consequently became the southern side. At the time of the\r\nshipwreck the magnetic deviation was much more easterly than it is now,\r\nso that _by compass_ the direction of the eastern coast was much more\r\nE.-W. than at present. Throughout his description of Bering Island,\r\nSteller says north and south, where we would say east and west.\r\n\r\n\"My visit to this locality in 1882, I have described in detail in\r\n_Deutsche Geographische Blätter_ (1885), where you will also find a\r\nsketch map of it, as well as a plan of the house in which the survivors\r\nwintered.\r\n\r\n\"Since I wrote my account, I have been able to consult Steller's own\r\ndescription of the wintering, and I find that the house which I have\r\ndescribed and given the plan of, was the one they built in the spring,\r\nafter the freshet which drove them out of the dug-outs (_Gruben_) on\r\nthe bank of the creek, traces of which are still visible. I also found\r\na number of relics at a place which I took to be the point where they\r\nrebuilt the vessel. In a letter Mr. Lauridsen suggested to me the\r\nprobability that I had found not this place, but the locality where the\r\nstore-house was built, in which the men left what they could not carry\r\non the new vessel, and that the latter must have been built near the\r\nsouthern end of the bay. After reading Steller's own account, however,\r\nI feel absolutely certain that the ship was built at the northern end,\r\nnear the huts and dug-outs, at the place where I found the relics. It\r\nis quite probable, however, that the store-house was built in very\r\nclose proximity, if not on the very spot.\"\r\n\r\n65. Leonhard Stejneger: _Fra det yderste Osten_.
