Greg, M.A.\r\n\r\nMCMVI.\r\n\r\nOxford: Horace Hart\r\nPrinter to the University\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGISTRIS MEIS\r\nAMICISQVE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome ten years ago, it may be, Mr. St. Loe Strachey suggested that I\r\nshould write an article on 'English Pastoral Drama' for a magazine of\r\nwhich he was then editor. The article was in the course of time written,\r\nand in the further course of time appeared. I learnt two things from\r\nwriting it: first, that to understand the English pastoral drama it was\r\nnecessary to have some more or less extensive knowledge of the history of\r\nEuropean pastoralism in general; secondly, that there was no critical work\r\nfrom which such knowledge could be obtained. I set about the revision and\r\nexpansion of my crude and superficial essay, proposing to prefix to it\r\nsuch an account of pastoral literature generally as should make the\r\nspecial form it assumed on the English stage appear in its true light as\r\nthe reasonable and rational outcome of artistic and historical conditions.\r\nUnfortunately perhaps, but at least inevitably, this preliminary inquiry\r\ngrew to ever greater and more alarming proportions as I proceeded, till at\r\nlast it swelled to something over half of the whole work. Part of this\r\nbulk was claimed by foreign pastoral poetry, the origins of the kind; part\r\nby English pastoral poetry, and the introduction of the fashion into this\r\ncountry; part by the pastoral drama of Italy, the immediate parent of that\r\nof England. The original title proved too narrow to cover the subject with\r\nwhich I dealt. Hence the rather vague and perhaps ambitions title of the\r\npresent volume. I make no pretence of offering the reader a general\r\nhistory of pastoral literature, nor even of pastoral drama. The real\r\nsubject of my work remains the pastoral drama in Elizabethan\r\nliterature--understanding that term in the wide sense in which, quite\r\nreasonably, we have learnt to use it--and even though I may have been\r\nsometimes carried away by the interest of the immediate subject of\r\ninvestigation, I have done my best to keep the main object of my inquiry\r\nat all times in view. The downward limit of my work is a little vague. The\r\nold stage traditions, upon which all the dramatic production of the time\r\nwas at least in some measure, and in different cases more or less\r\nconsciously, based, were killed by the act of 1642: the new traditions,\r\ncreated or imported by a company of gentlemen who had come under the\r\ninfluence of the French genius during the eleven years of their exile,\r\nfirst announced themselves authoritatively in 1660. During the intervening\r\neighteen years a number of works were produced, some of which continued\r\nthe earlier traditions, while some anticipated the later. My treatment has\r\nbeen eclectic. Where a work appeared to me to belong to or to illustrate\r\nthe older school I have included it, where not, I have refrained from\r\ndoing so. Fanshawe's _Pastor fido_ (1647) will be found mentioned in the\r\nfollowing pages, T. R.'s _Berger extravagant_ (1654) will not.\r\n\r\nSome explanation may be advisable with regard to my method of quotation.\r\nWhere a satisfactory modern edition of the work under discussion was\r\navailable I have taken my quotations from it, whether the spelling of the\r\ntext was modernized or not. Where none such existed I have had recourse to\r\nthe original. This explains the perhaps alarming mixture of old and modern\r\northographies which appear in my pages. Such inconsistency seemed to me a\r\nlesser evil than making nonce texts to suit my immediate purpose. I have,\r\nhowever, exercised the right of following my own fancy in the matter of\r\npunctuation throughout, and also in that of capitalization, though I have\r\nbeen chary of alterations in the case of old-spelling texts. This applies\r\nto English works. I have found it necessary myself to modernize to some\r\nextent the spelling of the quotations from early Italian in order to\r\nrender it less bewildering to readers who may possibly, like myself, have\r\nno very profound knowledge of the antiquities of that tongue. I have been\r\nas sparing as possible, however, and trust I may have committed no\r\nenormities to shock Romance scholars. Lastly, the italics and contractions\r\nwhich are of more or less frequent occurrence in the original editions\r\nhave been disregarded, and certain typographical details made to conform\r\nto modern practice.\r\n\r\nMy indebtedness is not small to a number of friends who, during the\r\nprogress of my work, have helped me more or less directly in a variety of\r\nways. A few have received specific mention in the notes. Alike to those\r\nwho have, and to the far greater number, I fear me, who have not, I desire\r\nhereby to confess my debt, and humbly to beg them to claim their share in\r\nthe dedication of this volume. More specifically I should mention Mr. R.\r\nB. McKerrow, who was the first to read the following pages in manuscript,\r\nand to make many useful suggestions, and Mr. Frank Sidgwick, to whose\r\ncareful revision alike of manuscript and proof and to whose kind and\r\ncandid criticism I am indebted perhaps more than an author's vanity may\r\nreadily allow me to acknowledge. Lastly, it would argue worse than\r\ningratitude to pass over my obligation to the admirable readers of the\r\nClarendon Press, whose marvellous accuracy in the most diverse fields and\r\nwhose almost infallible vigilance form a real asset of English\r\nscholarship.\r\n\r\nW.

It is the disadvantage of such an artificial\r\nform of literature as that which bears the name of pastoral that no such\r\n_a priori_ guidance is available. To lay down at starting that the\r\nessential quality of pastoral is the realistic or at least recognizably\r\n'natural' presentation of actual shepherd life would be to rule out of\r\ncourt nine tenths of the work that comes traditionally under that head.\r\nYet the great majority of critics, though they would not, of course,\r\nsubscribe to the above definition, have yet constantly betrayed an\r\ninclination to censure individual works for not conforming to some such\r\narbitrary canon. It is characteristic of the artificiality of pastoral as\r\na literary form that the impulse which gave the first creative touch at\r\nseeding loses itself later and finds no place among the forces at work at\r\nblossom time; the methods adopted by the greatest masters of the form are\r\ninconsistent with the motives that impelled them to its use, and where\r\nthese motives were followed to their logical conclusion, the resuit, both\r\nin literature and in life, became a byword for absurd unreality. To live\r\nat all the ideal appeared to require an atmosphere of paradox and\r\nincongruity: in its essence the most 'natural' of all poetic forms,\r\npastoralism came to its fairest flower amid the artificiality of a\r\ndecadent court or as the plaything of the leisure hours of a college of\r\nlearning, and its insipid convention having become 'a literary plague in\r\nevery European capital,' it finally disappeared from view amid the\r\nfopperies of the Roman Arcadia and the puerile conceits of the Petit\r\nTrianon.\r\n\r\nWherein then, it may be wondered, does the pastoral's title to\r\nconsideration lie. It does not lie primarily, or chiefly, in the fact that\r\nit is associated with names of the first rank in literature, with\r\nTheocritus and Vergil, with Petrarch, Politian, and Tasso, with Cervantes\r\nand Lope de Vega, with Ronsard and Marot, with Spenser, Ben Jonson, and\r\nMilton; nor yet that works such as the _Idyls_, the _Aminta_, the\r\n_Faithful Shepherdess_, and _Lycidas_ contain some of the most graceful\r\nand perfect verse to be found in any language. Rather is its importance to\r\nbe sought in the fact that the form is the expression of instincts and\r\nimpulses deep-rooted in the nature of humanity, which, while affecting the\r\nwhole course of literature, at times evince themselves most clearly and\r\narticulately here; that it plays a distinct and distinctive part in the\r\nhistory of human thought and the history of artistic expression. Moreover,\r\nit may be argued that, from this point of view, the very contradictions\r\nand inconsistencies to which I have alluded make it all the more important\r\nto discover wherein lay the strange vitality of the form and its power of\r\ninfluencing the current of European letters.\r\n\r\nFrom what has already been said it will be apparent that little would be\r\ngained by attempting beforehand to give any strict account of what is\r\nmeant by 'pastoral' in literature. Any definition sufficiently elastic to\r\ninclude the protean forms assumed by what we call the 'pastoral ideal'\r\ncould hardly have sufficient intension to be of any real value. If after\r\nconsidering a number of literary phenomena which appear to be related\r\namong themselves in form, spirit, and aim we come at the end of our\r\ninquiry to any clearer appreciation of the term I shall so far have\r\nattained my object. I notice that I have used the expression 'pastoral\r\nideal,' and the phrase, which comes naturally to the mind in connexion\r\nwith this form of literature, may supply us with a useful hint. It\r\nreminds us, namely, that the quality of pastoralism is not determined by\r\nthe fortuitous occurrence of certain characters, but by the fact of the\r\npieces in question being based more or less evidently upon a philosophical\r\nconception, which no doubt underwent modification through the ages, but\r\nyet bears evidence of organic continuity. Thus the shepherds of pastoral\r\nare primarily and distinctively shepherds; they are not mere rustics\r\nengaged in sheepcraft as one out of many of the employments of mankind. As\r\nsoon as the natural shepherd-life had found an objective setting in\r\nconscious artistic literature, it was felt that there was after all a\r\ndifference between hoeing turnips and pasturing sheep; that the one was\r\ncapable of a particular literary treatment which the other was not. The\r\nMaid of Orleans might equally well have dug potatoes as tended a flock,\r\nand her place is not in pastoral song. Thus pastoral literature must not\r\nbe confounded with that which has for its subject the lives, the ideas,\r\nand the emotions of simple and unsophisticated mankind, far from the\r\ncentres of our complex civilization. The two may be in their origin\r\nrelated, and they occasionally, as it were, stretch out feelers towards\r\none another, but the pastoral of tradition lies in its essence as far from\r\nthe human document of humble life as from a scientific treatise on\r\nagriculture or a volume of pastoral theology. Thus the tract which lies\r\nbefore us to explore is equally remote from the idyllic imagination of\r\nGeorge Sand, the gross actuality of Zola, and the combination of simple\r\ncharm with minute and essential realism of Mr. Hardy's sketches in Wessex.\r\nNor does the adoption of the pastoral label suffice to bring within the\r\nfold the fanciful animalism of Mr. Hewlett. By far the most remarkable\r\nwork of recent years to assume the title is Signor d'Annunzio's play _La\r\nFiglia di Iorio_, a work in which the author's powerful and delicate\r\nimagination and wealth of pure and expressive language appear in matchless\r\nperfection. It is perhaps scarcely necessary to add that there is nothing\r\nin common between the 'pastoral ideal' and the rugged strength and\r\nsuppressed fire of the great modern Italian's portrait of his native land\r\nof the Abruzzi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nSome confusion of thought appears to have prevailed among writers as to\r\nthe origin of pastoral. We are, for instance, often told that it is the\r\nearliest of all forms of poetry, that it characterizes primitive peoples\r\nand permeates ancient literatures. Song is, indeed, as old as human\r\nlanguage, and in a sense no doubt the poetry of the pastoral age may be\r\nsaid to have been pastoral. It does not, however, follow that it bears any\r\nessential resemblance to that which subsequent ages have designated by the\r\nname. All that we know concerning the songs of pastoral nations leads us\r\nto suppose that they bear a close resemblance to the type of popular verse\r\ncurrent wherever poetry exists, folk-songs of broad humanity in which\r\nlittle stress is laid on the peculiar circumstances of shepherd life. An\r\ninsistence upon the objective pastoral setting is of prime importance in\r\nunderstanding the real nature of pastoral poetry; it not only serves to\r\ndistinguish the pastoral proper from the more vaguely idyllic forms of\r\nlyric verse, but helps us further to understand how it was that the\r\noutward features of the kind came to be preserved, even after the various\r\nnecessities of sophisticated society had metamorphosed the content almost\r\nbeyond recognition. No common feature of a kind to form the basis of a\r\nscientific classification can be traced in the spontaneous shepherd-songs\r\nand their literary counterpart. What does appear to be a constant element\r\nin the pastoral as known to literature is the recognition of a contrast,\r\nimplicit or expressed, between pastoral life and some more complex type of\r\ncivilization. At no stage in its development does literature, or at any\r\nrate poetry, concern itself with the obvious, with the bare scaffolding of\r\nlife: whenever we find an author interested in the circle of prime\r\nnecessity we may be sure that he himself stands outside it. Thus the\r\nshepherd when he sang did not insist upon the conditions amid which his\r\nuneventful life was passed. It was left to a later, perhaps a wiser and a\r\nsadder, generation to gaze with fruitless and often only half sincere\r\nlonging at the shepherd-boy asleep under the shadow of the thorn, lulled\r\nby the low monotonous rustle of the grazing flock. Only when the\r\nshepherd-songs ceased to be the outcome of unalloyed pastoral conditions\r\ndid they become distinctively pastoral. It is therefore significant that\r\nthe earliest pastoral poetry with which we are acquainted, whatever half\r\narticulate experiments may have preceded it, was itself directly born of\r\nthe contrast between the recollections of a childhood spent among the\r\nSicilian uplands and the crowded social and intellectual city-life of\r\nAlexandria[1].\r\n\r\nAs the result of this contrast there arises an idea which comes perhaps as\r\nnear being universal in pastoral as any--the idea, namely, of the 'golden\r\nage.' This embraces, indeed, a field not wholly coincident with that of\r\npastoral, but the two are connected alike by a common spring in human\r\nemotion and constant literary association. The fiction of an age of\r\nsimplicity and innocence found birth among the Augustan writers in the\r\nmidst of the complex and luxurious civilization of Rome, as an\r\nillustration of the principle enunciated by Professer Raleigh, that\r\n'literature has constantly the double tendency to negative the life\r\naround it, as well as to reproduce it.' Having inspired Ovid and Vergil,\r\nand been recognized by Lucretius, it passed as a literary legacy to\r\nBoethius, Dante, and Jean de Meung; it was incorporated by Frezzi in his\r\nstrange allegorical composition the _Quadriregio_, and was thrice handled\r\nby Chaucer; it was dealt with humorously by Cervantes in _Don Quixote_,\r\nand became the prey of the satirist in the hands of Juvenal, Bertini, and\r\nHall. The association of this ideal world with the simplicity of pastoral\r\nlife was effected by Vergil, and in this form it was treated with loving\r\nminuteness by Tasso in his _Aminta_ and by Browne in his _Britannia's\r\nPastorals_[2]. The fiction no doubt answered to some need in human nature,\r\nbut in literature it soon came to be no more than a polite convention.\r\n\r\nThe conception of a golden age of rustic simplicity does not, indeed,\r\ninvolve the whole of pastoral literature. It does not account either for\r\nthe allegorical pastoral, in which actual personages are introduced, in\r\nthe guise of shepherds, to discuss contemporary affairs, or for the\r\nso-called realistic pastoral, in which the town looks on with amused envy\r\nat the rustic freedom of the country. What it does comprehend is that\r\noutburst of pastoral song which sprang from the yearning of the tired soul\r\nto escape, if it were but in imagination and for a moment, to a life of\r\nsimplicity and innocence from the bitter luxury of the court and the\r\nmenial bread of princes[3].\r\n\r\nAnd this, the reaction against the world that is too much with us, is,\r\nafter all, the keynote of what is most intimately associated with the name\r\nof pastoral in literature--the note that is struck with idyllic sweetness\r\nin Theocritus, and, rising to its fullest pitch of lyrical intensity,\r\nlends a poignant charm to the work of Tasso and Guarini. For everywhere\r\nin these soft melodies of luscious beauty, even in the studied sketches of\r\nprimitive innocence itself, there is an undercurrent of tender melancholy\r\nand pathos:\r\n\r\n            Il mondo invecchia\r\n    E invecchiando intristisce.\r\n\r\nI have said that a sense of the contrast between town and country was\r\nessential to the development of a distinctively pastoral literature. It\r\nwould be an interesting task to trace how far this contrast is the source\r\nof the various subsidiary types--of the ideal where it breeds desire for a\r\nreturn to simplicity, of the realistic where the humour of it touches the\r\nimagination, and of the allegorical where it suggests satire on the\r\ncorruption of an artificial civilization.\r\n\r\nWhen the kind first makes its appearance in a world already old, it arises\r\npurely as a solace and relief from the fervid life of actuality, and comes\r\nas a fresh and cooling draught to lips burning with the fever of the city.\r\nIn passing from Alexandria to Rome it lost much of its limpid purity; the\r\nclear crystal of the drink was mixed with flavours and perfumes to fit the\r\npalate of a patron or an emperor. The example of adulteration being once\r\nset, the implied contrast of civilization and rusticity was replaced by\r\ndirect satire on the former, and later by the discussion under the\r\npastoral mask of questions of religious and political controversy. Proving\r\nitself but a left-handed weapon in such debate, it became a court\r\nplaything, in which princes and great ladies, poets and wits, loved to see\r\nthemselves figured and complimented, and the practice of assuming pastoral\r\nnames becoming almost universal in polite circles, the convention, which\r\nhad passed from the eclogue on to the stage, passed from the stage into\r\nactual existence, and court life became one continual pageant of pastoral\r\nconceit. From the court it passed into circles of learning, and grave\r\njurists and administrators, poets and scholars, set about the refining of\r\nlanguage and literature decked out in all the fopperies of the fashionable\r\ncraze. One is tempted to wonder whether anything more serious than light\r\nloves and fantastic amours can have flourished amid eighteenth-century\r\npastoralism. When the ladies of the court began to talk dairy-farming with\r\nthe scholars and statesmen of the day, the pretence of pastoral simplicity\r\ncould hardly be long kept up. Nor was there any attempt to do so. In the\r\nintroduction to his famous romance d'Urfé wrote in answer to objectors:\r\n'Responds leur, ma Bergere, que pour peu qu'ils ayent connoissance de toy,\r\nils sçauront que tu n'es pas, ny celles aussi qui te suivent, de ces\r\nBergeres necessiteuses, qui pour gaigner leur vie conduisent les troupeaux\r\naux pasturages; mais que vous n'avez toutes pris cette condition que pour\r\nvivre plus doucement et sans contrainte.' No wonder that to Fontenelle\r\nTheocritus' shepherds 'sentent trop la campagne[4].' But the hour of\r\npastoralism had come, and while the ladies and gallants of the court were\r\nplaying the parts of Watteau swains and shepherdesses amid the trim hedges\r\nand smooth lawns of Versailles, the gates were already bursting before the\r\nflood, which was to sweep in devastation over the land, and to purge the\r\nold order of social life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Alexandria of the Ptolemies was not the nurse of a great literature,\r\nthough the age was undoubtedly one of considerable literary activity.\r\nScholastic learning and poetic imitation were rife; the rehandling of\r\nGreek masterpieces was a fashionable pastime. For serious and original\r\ncomposition, however, the conditions were not favourable. That the age\r\nproduced no great epic was less due to the disparagement of the form\r\nindulged in by Callimachus, chief librarian and literary dictator, than to\r\nthe inherent temper of society. The prevailing taste was for an arrogant\r\ndisplay of rare and costly pageantry. At the coronation of Ptolemy\r\nPhiladelphus the brilliant city surfeited on a long-drawn golden pomp,\r\ndecked out in all the physical beauty the inheritance of Greek thought and\r\nmemories of Greek mythology could suggest, together with a wealth of\r\ngorgeous mysticism and rapture of sensuous intoxication, which was the\r\nfruit of its intercourse with the oriental world. The writers of\r\nAlexandria lacked the 'high seriousness' of purpose to produce an\r\n_Aeneid_, the imaginative enthusiasm needed for a _Faery Queen_. What they\r\npossessed was delicacy, refinement, and wit; what they created, while\r\nperfecting the epigram and stereotyping the hymn, was a form intermediate\r\nbetween epic and lyric, namely the idyl as we find it in the works of\r\nTheocritus, Bion, and Moschus.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the literary _milieu_ in which Theocritus\r\nmoved at Alexandria must have abounded in all those temptations which\r\nproved the bane of pastoral poetry at Rome, Florence, and Ferrara. There\r\nwere princes and patrons to be flattered, there were panegyrics to be sung\r\nand ancestral feats of arms to be recorded; nor does Theocritus appear to\r\nhave stood aloof from the throng of court poetasters. In spite of the\r\ndoubtful authenticity of some of the pieces connected with his name, there\r\nappears no sufficient reason to deprive him of the rather conventional\r\nhymns and other poems composed with a view to court-favour. These have\r\nlittle interest for us to-day: his fame rests on works which probably\r\ngained him little advantage at the time. It was for his own solace,\r\nforgetful for a moment of the intrigues of court life and the uncertain\r\nsunshine of princes, that he wrote his Sicilian idyls. For him, as at a\r\nmagic touch, the walls of the heated city melted like a mirage into the\r\nsands of the salt lagoon, and he wandered once more amid the green woods\r\nand pastures of Trinacria, the noonday sun tempered by the shade of the\r\nchestnuts and the babbling of the brook, and by the cool airs that glide\r\ndown from the white cliffs of Aetna. There once more he saw the shepherds\r\ntend their flocks, singing or wrangling with one another, dreamily piping\r\non their wax-stopped reeds or plotting to annex their neighbours' gear; or\r\nelse there sounded in his ears the love-song or the dirge, or the\r\nincantation of the forsaken girl rose amid the silence to the silver moon.\r\nOnce again he stood upon the shore and watched the fishers cast their\r\nnets, while around him the goats browsed on the close herbage of the\r\ncliff, and the crystal stream leapt down, and the waves broke upon the\r\nrocks below, till he saw the breasts of the nymphs shine in the whiteness\r\nof the foam and their hair spread wide in the weed, and the fair Galatea,\r\nthe enticing and the fickle, mocked the clumsy suit of the Cyclops, as she\r\ntossed upward the bitter spray from off her shining limbs. All these\r\nmemories he recorded with a loving faithfulness of detail that it is even\r\nnow possible to verify from the folk-songs of the south. To this day in\r\nthe Isles of Greece ruined girls seek to lure back their lovers with\r\ncharms differing but little from that sung by the Syracusan to Lady\r\nSelene, and the popular poetry alike of Italy and Greece is full of those\r\ndelicate touches of refined sentiment that in Theocritus appear so\r\nincongruous with the rough coats and rougher banter of the shepherds. For\r\nthough the poet raised the pastoral life of Sicily into the realms of\r\nideal poetry, he was careful not to dissociate his version from reality,\r\nand he allowed no imaginary conceptions to overmaster his art. He depicted\r\nno age of innocence; his poetry reflects no philosophical illusion of\r\nprimitive simplicity; he elaborated no imaginary cult of mystical worship.\r\nHis art, however little it may tempt us to the use of the term realism, is\r\nnevertheless based on an almost passionate sympathy with actual human\r\nnature. This is the fount of his inspiration, the central theme of his\r\nsong. The literary genius of Greece showed little aptitude for landscape,\r\nand seldom treated inanimate nature except as a background for human\r\naction and emotion, or it may be in the guise of mythological allegory.\r\nNevertheless, it is hard to believe that Theocritus, so tenderly concerned\r\nwith the homely aspects of human life, was not likewise sensitive to the\r\nbeauties of nature. At least it is impossible to doubt his attachment to\r\nthe land of his childhood, and it is at worst a welcome dream when we\r\nimagine him, as the evening of life drew on, leaving the formal gardens\r\nand painted landscapes of Alexandria and returning to Syracuse and his\r\nbeloved Sicily once more.[5]\r\n\r\nThe verse of Theocritus was echoed by his younger contemporaries, Bion\r\nand Moschus.[6] The former is best known through the oriental passion of\r\nhis 'Woe, woe for Adonis,' probably written to be sung at the annual\r\nfestival of Syrian origin commemorated by Theocritus in his fifteenth\r\nidyl.[7] The most important extant work of Moschus is the 'Lament for\r\nBion,' characterized by a certain delicate sentimentality alien to the\r\nspirit of either of his predecessors. It is perhaps significant that\r\nTheocritus appears to have been of Syracusan, Bion of Smyrnian, and\r\nMoschus of Ausonian origin.[8] With the exception of this poem, which is\r\nmodelled on Theocritus' 'Lament for Daphnis,' there is little in the work\r\nof either of the younger poets of a pastoral nature. Certain fragments,\r\nhowever, if genuine, suggest that poems of the kind may have perished.\r\nAmong the remains of Moschus occurs the following:\r\n\r\n    Would that my father had taught me the craft of a keeper of sheep,\r\n    For so in the shade of the elm-tree, or under the rocks on the steep,\r\n    Piping on reeds I had sat, and had lulled my sorrow to sleep;[9]\r\n\r\nlines in which we already take leave of the genuine love of the pastoral\r\nlife, springing from an intimate knowledge of and delight in nature, and\r\nsee world-weariness arraying itself in the sentimental garb of the\r\nimaginary swain.\r\n\r\nOnce again, five centuries later,[10] the spirit of Greece shone for one\r\nbrief moment in a work of pastoral elegance that has survived the\r\nchanging tastes of succeeding generations. The 'romance of _Daphnis and\r\nChloe_ is the last word of a world of sensuous enervation toying with the\r\nidea of vernal freshness and virginity. It is a genuine picture of the\r\npurity of awakening love, wrought with every delicacy of sentiment and\r\nexpression, and yet in such manner as by its very _naïveté_ and innocence\r\nto serve as a goad to satiated appetite. It has been suggested that the\r\nwork should properly be styled the _Lesbiaca_, a name which recalls the\r\n_Aethiopica_ and _Babylonica_, and reminds us that the author, though a\r\nstudent of Alexandrian literature, belonged to the school of the erotic\r\nromanciers and traditional bishops, Heliodorus and Achilles Tatius. Of his\r\nlife we know nothing, and even his name--Longus--has been called in\r\nquestion. The story, unlike those of most later pastoral romances, is of\r\nthe simplest. The author, however, was no longer satisfied with the\r\nnatural refinement of popular love poetry; the central characters are\r\nrepresented as foundlings nurtured by the shepherds of Lesbos, and are\r\nultimately identified, on much the same conventional evidence as Ion and\r\nothers had been before, as the children of certain rich and aristocratie\r\nfamilies.[11] The interest of the story lies in the growth of their\r\nunconscious love, which constitutes the central theme of the work, though\r\nrelieved here and there by wholly colourless adventure.\r\n\r\nA Latin translation made the book popular after the introduction of\r\nprinting, and the renaissance saw the French version by Amyot, a work of\r\nEuropean reputation. This was translated into English under Elizabeth; an\r\nItalian translation followed in the seventeenth century,[12] and a Spanish\r\nis also extant. There is no doubt that it was widely read throughout the\r\nsixteenth and following centuries, but it exercised little influence on\r\nthe development of pastoral literature. By the time it became generally\r\nknown the main features of renaissance pastoral were already fixed, and in\r\nmotive and treatment alike it was alien to the spirit that animated the\r\nfashionable masterpieces. The modern pastoral romance had already evolved\r\nitself from a blending of the eclogue with the mythological tale. The\r\ndrama was developing on independent lines. Thus although, like the other\r\nromances of the late Greek school, it supplied many incidents and\r\ndescriptions to be found in later works, it played no vital part in the\r\nhistory of pastoral, and left no mark either on the general form or on the\r\nspirit that animated the kind. Longus' romance finds its true descendant,\r\nas well as its closest imitation, in a work that achieved celebrity on the\r\neve of the French revolution, that masterpiece of unreal and sentimental\r\nsimplicity, Saint-Pierre's _Paul et Virginie_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nA faithful reproduction of the main conditions of actual life was the\r\ncharacteristic of Theocritus' poetry. It was subject to this ever-present\r\nlimitation that his graceful fancy exercised its power of idealization. He\r\ntook the singing match, the dirge, and the love-song or complaint as he\r\nfound them among the shepherd-folk of Sicily, and gave them that objective\r\nsetting which is as necessary to pastoral as to every other merely\r\naccidental form of poetry; for the true subjective lyric is independent of\r\ncircumstances. The first of his great successors made the bucolic eclogue\r\nwhat, with trifling variation, it was to remain for eighteen centuries, a\r\nform based upon artificiality and convention. I have already pointed out\r\nthat the literary conditions at Alexandria did not differ materially from\r\nthose of Rome; it follows that the change must have been due to the\r\ncharacter of Vergil himself. That intense love of beauty for its own sake\r\nwhich characterized the Greek mind had little hold over the Roman. Nor did\r\nthe latter understand the charm of untaught simplicity. It is true that to\r\nthe Roman poets of the Augustan period we owe the conception of the golden\r\nage, but it remained with them rather a philosophical mythus than the\r\ndream of an idyllic poet. To writers of the stamp of Ovid, Lucretius, and\r\nVergil the Idyls of the Syracusan poet can have possessed but little\r\nmeaning, and in his own Bucolics the last named seems never to have\r\nregarded the pastoral form as anything but a cloak for matters of more\r\npith and moment. Although he followed Theocritus in his use of the several\r\ntypes of song and stamped them to all future ages in pastoral convention,\r\nthough he may have begun with fairly close imitation of his model and only\r\ngradually diverged into a more independant style, he at no time showed\r\nhimself content with the earlier poet's simplicity of motive.[13] The\r\neclogue in which he followed Theocritus most closely, the eighth, is\r\nequally, perhaps, the most pleasing of the series. It combines the motives\r\nof the love-lament and incantation, and the closeness with which it\r\nfollows while playing variations on its models is striking. One instance\r\nwill suffice. Take the passage in the second Idyl thus rendered by\r\nSymonds:[14]\r\n\r\n    Hail, Hecatë, dread dame! to the end be thou my assistant,\r\n    Making my medicines work no less than the philtre of Circë,\r\n    Or Medea's charms, or yellow-haired Perimedë's.\r\n      Wheel of the magic spells, draw thou that man to my dwelling.\r\n\r\nCorresponding to this we find the following passage in the Latin poem:\r\n\r\n    Song hath power to draw from heaven the wandering huntress,\r\n    Song was the witch's spell transformed the mates of Ulysses....\r\n      Home from the city to me, my song, lead home to me Daphnis.\r\n\r\nVergil was the first to begin the dissociation of pastoral from the\r\nconditions of actual life, and just as his shepherds cease to present the\r\nfeatures and characters of the homely keepers of the flock, so his\r\nlandscape becomes imaginary and undefined. This peculiarity has been\r\nnoticed by Professor Herford in some very suggestive remarks prefixed to\r\nhis edition of the _Shepherd's Calender_. 'The profiles of the Sicilian\r\nuplands,' he writes, 'waver uncertainly amid traits drawn from the Mantuan\r\nplain. In this confusion lay, perhaps, the germ of those debates between\r\nhighland and lowland shepherds which reverberate through the later\r\npastoral, and are still loud in Spenser.' The gulf that separated Vergil\r\nfrom his predecessor, in so far as their treatment of shepherd-life is\r\nconcerned, may be measured by the manner in which they respectively deal\r\nwith the supernatural. In the Greek Idyls we find the simple faith or\r\nsuperstition as it lived among the shepherd-folk; no Pan appears to sow\r\ndismay in the breasts of the maidens, nor do we find aught of the mystical\r\nworship that later gathered round him in the imaginary Arcadia. He is\r\nmentioned only as the rugged patron of herds and song, the wild indweller\r\nof the savage woods as he appeared to the minds of the simple swains, who\r\nhushed their midday piping fearful lest they should disturb the sleep of\r\nthe god. It is true that Theocritus introduces mythological characters in\r\nthe tale of Galatea, but it should be noticed that this merely forms the\r\ntheme of a song or the subject of a poetical epistle to a friend.\r\nMoreover, it is open to more than one rationalistic interpretation.\r\nSymonds treats it as an allegory in harmony with the mythopoeic genius of\r\nGreek poetry. It is equally possible to regard the Cyclops as emblematic\r\nmerely of the rough neatherd flouted by the more delicate\r\nshepherd-maiden--the contrast is of constant occurrence in later\r\nworks--for, alike in one of his own fragments and in Moschus' lament, Bion\r\nis represented as courting this same Galatea after she has rid herself of\r\nthe suit of Polyphemus. Vergil was content with no such simple mythology\r\nas this. He must needs shake Silenus from a drunken sleep and bid him tell\r\nof Chaos and old Time, of the infancy of the world and the birth of the\r\ngods. This mixture of obsolescent theology and Epicurean philosophy\r\nprobably possessed little reality for Vergil himself, and would have\r\nconveyed no meaning whatever to the Sicilian shepherds. Its introduction\r\nstamps his eclogues with that unreality which has been the reproach of the\r\npastoral from his day to ours. The didactic homily was one fresh\r\nconvention introduced. Far more important was the tendency to make every\r\nform subserve some ulterior purpose of allegory and panegyric.[15] For the\r\nRoman its own beauty was no sufficient end of art. That the _Aeneid_ was\r\nwritten for the glorification of Rome cannot be made a reproach to the\r\npoet; the greatness of the end lent dignity to the means. That the\r\npastoral was forced to serve the menial part of a vehicle of sycophantic\r\npraise is less easily pardoned. In Vergil's hands a conversation between\r\nshepherds becomes an expression of gratitude to the emperor for the\r\nrestitution of his villa, a lament for Daphnis is interwoven with an\r\napotheosis of Julius Caesar, and in the complaint of the forsaken\r\nshepherd, whom Apollo and Pan seek in vain to comfort, we may trace the\r\nwounded vanity of his patron deserted by his mistress for the love of a\r\nsoldier. The fourth eclogue was written after the peace of Brundisium, and\r\ndescribes the golden age to which Vergil looked forward as consequent upon\r\nthe birth of a marvellous infant, perhaps some offspring of the marriages\r\nof Antonius and Octavianus, celebrated in solemnization of the treaty. The\r\npoem achieved considerable fame, which lasted as late as the time of\r\nDryden, owing to the belief that it contained a prophecy of the birth of\r\nChrist drawn from the Sibylline books, and won for Vergil throughout the\r\nmiddle ages the title of prophet and magician. Whether this belief was\r\nwell founded or not may be left to those whom it may interest to inquire;\r\nit is sufficient for our purpose to note that in the poem in question\r\nVergil first introduced the convention of the golden age into pastoral\r\nverse.\r\n\r\nThe first of the long line of imitators of whom we have any notice was a\r\ncertain Calpurnius. His diction is correct and his verse smooth, but the\r\nsuggestion that he belonged to the age of Augustus has not met with much\r\nfavour among those competent to judge. He followed Vergil closely, chiefly\r\ndeveloping the panegyric. His poems, however, include all the usual\r\nconventions, singing matches, invocations, cosmologies, and the rest, in\r\nthe treatment of which originality never appears to have been his aim.\r\nSome of his pieces deal with husbandry, and belong more strictly to the\r\nschool of the _Georgics_ and didactic poetry. The most interesting of his\r\neclogues is one in which he contrasts the life of the town with that of\r\nthe country, the direct comparison of which he appears to have been the\r\nfirst to treat. The poem likewise possesses some antiquarian interest,\r\nowing to a description of a wild-beast show in an amphitheatre in which\r\nthe animals were brought up in lifts through the floor of the arena.\r\nCalpurnius is sometimes supposed, on account of a dedication to Nemesianus\r\nfound in some manuscripts, to have lived at the end of the third century,\r\nbut even supposing the dedication to be genuine, which is more than\r\ndoubtful, it does not follow that the person referred to is that\r\nNemesianus who contested the poetic crown with Prince Numerianus about the\r\nyear 283[16]. This Nemesianus was probably the author of some eclogues\r\nwhich have been frequently ascribed to Calpurnius (numbers 8 to 11 in most\r\neditions), but which must be discarded from the list of his authentic\r\nworks on a technical question of the employment of elision[17]. The\r\n_editio princeps_ of these eclogues is not dated, but probably appeared in\r\n1471, so that they were at any rate accessible to writers of the\r\n_cinquecento_. It is not easy to trace any direct influence, unless, as\r\nperhaps we should, we credit to Calpurnius the suggestion of those poems\r\nin which a 'wise' shepherd describes to his less-travelled hearers the\r\nmanners of the town.\r\n\r\nA few pieces from the _Idyllia_ of Ausonius appear in some of the bucolic\r\ncollections, but they cannot strictly be regarded as coming within the\r\nrange of pastoral poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents conspired to make Vergil the model for later writers of eclogues.\r\nThe fame of the poet was a potent cause among many. Another reason why\r\nTheocritus found no direct imitators may be sought in the respective\r\nmethods of the two poets. Work of the nature of the _Idyls_ has to depend\r\nfor its value and interest upon the artistic qualities of the poetry\r\nalone. Such work may spring up spontaneously under almost any conditions;\r\nit is seldom produced through imitation. On the other hand, any scholar\r\nwith a gift for easy versification could achieve a certain distinction as\r\na follower of Vergil. His verse depended for its interest not on its\r\npoetic qualities but upon the importance of the themes it treated.\r\nAccidental conditions, too, told in favour of the Roman poet. During the\r\nmiddle ages Latin was a universal language among the lettered classes,\r\nwhile the knowledge of Greek, though at no time so completely lost as is\r\nsometimes supposed, was a far rarer accomplishment, and was restricted for\r\nthe most part to a few linguistic scholars. Thus before the revival of\r\nlearning had made Greek a possible source of literary inspiration, the\r\nVergilian tradition, through the instrumentality of Petrarch and\r\nBoccaccio, had already made itself supreme in pastoral[18].\r\n\r\nDuring the middle ages the stream of pastoral production, though it\r\nnowhere actually disappears, is reduced to the merest trickle. Notices of\r\nsuch isolated poems as survive have been carefully collected by\r\nMacrì-Leone in the introduction to his elaborate but as yet unfinished\r\nwork on the Latin eclogue in the Italian literature of the fourteenth\r\ncentury. As early as the end of the fourth or beginning of the fifth\r\ncentury we find a poem by Severus Sanctus Endelechius, variously entitled\r\n'Carmen bucolicum de virtute signi crucis domini' or 'de mortibus boum.'\r\nIt is a hymn to the saint cross, and in it for the first time the pastoral\r\nsuffered violence from the tyranny of the religious idea. The 'Ecloga\r\nTheoduli' alluded to by Chaucer in the _House of Fame_[19] appears to be\r\nthe work of an Athenian writer, and is ascribed to various dates ranging\r\nfrom the fifth to the eighth centuries. While preserving as its main\r\ncharacteristic a close subservience to its Vergilian model, the eclogue\r\nparticipated in the general rise of allegory which marked the later middle\r\nages. Pastoral colouring of no very definite order had shown itself in the\r\nelegies of Alcuin in the eighth century, as also in the 'Conflictus veris\r\net hiemis,' traditionally ascribed to the Venerable Bede, but more\r\nprobably the work of one Dodus, a disciple of Alcuin. Of the tenth century\r\nwe possess an allegorical religious lament entitled 'Ecloga duarum\r\nsanctimonialium.' About 1160 a Benedictine monk named Metellus composed\r\ntwelve poems under the title of _Bucolica Quirinalium_, in honour of St.\r\nQuirinus and in obvious imitation of Vergil. Reminiscences and paraphrases\r\nof the Roman poet are scattered throughout the monk's own barbarous\r\nhexameters, as in the opening verses:\r\n\r\n    Tityre tu magni recubans in margine stagni\r\n    Silvestri tenuique fide pete iura peculi!\r\n\r\nIt would hardly be worth recording these medieval clerks, the\r\nundistinguished writers, 'de quibus,' Boccaccio said, 'nil curandum est,'\r\nwere it not that they show how the memory at least of the classical\r\npastoral survived amid the ruins of ancient learning, and so serve to lead\r\nup to one last spasmodic manifestation of the kind in certain poems which\r\nelse appear to stand in a curiously isolated position.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1319, during the bitter years of his exile at Ravenna, that\r\nDante received from one John of Bologna, known, on account of his fame as\r\na writer of Latin verse, as Giovanni del Virgilio, a poetical epistle\r\ninviting him to visit the author in his native city. His correspondent,\r\nwhile doing homage to his poetic genius, incidentally censured him for\r\ncomposing his great work in the base tongue of the vulgar[20]. Dante\r\nreplied in a Vergilian eclogue, courteously declining Giovanni's\r\ninvitation to Bologna, on the ground that it was a place scarcely safe for\r\nhis person. As regarded the strictures of his correspondent, his\r\ntriumphant answer in the shape of the _Paradiso_ lay yet unfinished, so\r\nthe author of the _De Vulgari Eloquio_ trifled with the charge and\r\npurported to compose the present poem in earnest of reform. There is a\r\ntone of not unkindly irony about the whole. Was it an elaborate jest at\r\nthe expense of Giovanni, the writer of Vergilian verse? The Bolognese\r\nreplied, this time also in bucolic form, repeating his invitation and\r\nholding out the special attraction of a meeting with Mussato, the most\r\nregarded poet of his day in Europe. Dante's second eclogue, if indeed it\r\nis correctly ascribed to his pen, introduces several historical\r\ncharacters. It is said not to have reached Bologna till after his death.\r\nThese poems were not included in any of the early bucolic collections, and\r\nfirst appeared in print in the eighteenth century. They seem, from their\r\npurely occasional nature, their inconspicuous bulk, and lack of any\r\nstriking characteristics, to have attracted little notice in their own\r\nday, and to have been ignored by later writers on pastoral as forming no\r\nlink in the chain of historical development. Given, indeed, the Bucolics\r\nof Vergil, they are imitations such as might at any moment have appeared,\r\nirrespective of date and surroundings, and independent of any living\r\nliterary tradition[21]. It is therefore impossible to regard them as in\r\nany way belonging to, or foreshadowing, the great body of renaissance\r\npastoral, a division of literature endowed with remarkable vitality and\r\nevolutionary force, which must in its growth and decay alike be studied in\r\nclose connexion with the ideas and temperament of the age, and in\r\nrelation to the general development of the history of letters[22].\r\n\r\nThe grandeur of the Roman Empire, the background against which in\r\nhistorical retrospect we see the bucolic eclogues of Vergil and his\r\nimmediate followers, had vanished when Italian literature once more rose\r\nout of chaos. The political organism had resolved itself into its\r\nconstituent elements, and fresh combinations had arisen. Nevertheless,\r\nthough the Empire was hardly now the shadow of its pristine greatness, men\r\nstill looked to Rome as the centre of the civilized world. As the seat of\r\nthe Church, it stood for the one force capable of supplying a permanent\r\nelement among the warring interests of European politics. Nothing was more\r\nnatural than that the poetic form that had reflected the glories of\r\nimperial Rome should bow to the fascination of Rome, the visible emblem on\r\nearth of the spiritual empire of Christ. To the medieval mind, so far from\r\nthere being any antagonism between the two ideas, the one seemed almost to\r\ninvolve and necessitate the other. It saw in the splendeur of the Empire\r\nthe herald of a glory not of this world, a preparation as it were, a\r\ndecking of the chamber against the advent of the bride; and thus the\r\npastoral which sang of the greatness of pagan Rome appeared at the same\r\ntime a hymn prophetic of the glory of the Church[23].\r\n\r\nMoreover, during the centuries that had elapsed since the days of Vergil\r\nthe term 'pastoral' had gained a new meaning and new associations. In the\r\ndays of Augustus Pan was a boorish anachronism; it was left to medieval\r\nChristianity to create a god who was in fact a shepherd of men[24] and so\r\nto render possible a pastoral allegory that should embody the dearest\r\nhopes and aspirations of the human heart. That Christian pastoralists\r\navailed themselves successfully of the possibilities of the theme it would\r\nbe difficult to maintain. It is a singular fact that, at a time when\r\nallegory was the characteristic literary form, it was yet so impossible\r\neven for the finer spirits to follow a train of thought clearly and\r\nconsistently, that it was only when a mind passed beyond the limitations\r\nof its own age, and assumed a position _sub specie aeternitatis_, that it\r\nwas able to free itself from the prevalent confusion of the imaginary and\r\nthe real, the word and the idea, and to perceive that success in allegory\r\ndepends, not on the chaotic intermingling of the attributes of the type\r\nand the thing typified, but on so representing the one as to suggest and\r\nilluminate the other.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of renascent humanism, the first to renew the pastoral\r\ntradition, broken for some ten centuries, was Francesco Petrarca. It is\r\nnot without significance that the first modern eclogues were from the same\r\npen as the sonnet 'Fontana di dolore, albergo d'ira,' expressive of the\r\nshame with which earnest sons of the Church contemplated the captivity of\r\nthe holy father at Avignon; for thus on the very threshold of Arcadia we\r\nare met with those bitter denunciations of ecclesiastical corruption which\r\nstrike so characteristic a note in the works of the satirical Mantuan, and\r\nseem so out of place in the songs of Spenser and Milton. In one eclogue\r\nthe poet mourns over the ruin and desolation of Rome, as a mother deserted\r\nof her children; another is a dialogue between two shepherds, in which St.\r\nPeter, under the pastoral disguise of Pamphilus, upbraids the licentious\r\nClement VI with the ignoble servitude in which he is content to abide; a\r\nthird shows us Clement wantoning with the shameless mistress of a line of\r\npontifical shepherds, a figure allegorical of the corruption of the\r\nChurch[25]; in yet a fourth Petrarch laments his estrangement from his\r\npatron Giovanni Colonna, a cardinal in favour at the papal court, whom it\r\nwould appear his outspoken censures had offended. Petrarch's was not the\r\nonly voice that was raised urging the Pope to return from the 'Babylonian\r\ncaptivity,' but the protest had peculiar significance from the mouth of\r\none who stood forth as the embodiment of the new age still struggling in\r\nthe throes of birth. When 'the first Italian' accepted the laurel crown at\r\nthe Capitol, he dreamed of Rome as once more the heart of the world, the\r\ncity which should embody that early Italian idea of nationality, the ideal\r\nof the humanistic commonwealth. The course urged alike by Petrarch and by\r\nSt. Catherine was in the end followed, but the years of exile were yet to\r\nbear their bitterest fruit of mortification and disgrace. In 1377 Gregory\r\nXI transferred the seat of the papacy from Avignon to Rome, with the\r\nresuit that the world was treated to the edifying spectacle of three\r\nprelates each claiming to be the vicar of Christ and sole father of the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nThese ecclesiastical eclogues form the most important contribution made by\r\nItaly's greatest lyric poet to pastoral. Others, one in honour of Robert\r\nof Sicily, another recording the defeat of Pan by Articus on the field of\r\nPoitiers, follow already existing pastoral convention. Some few, again, of\r\nless importance in literary history, are of greater personal or poetic\r\ninterest. In one we see Francesco and his brother Gherardo wandering in\r\nthe realm of shepherds, and there exchanging their views concerning\r\nreligious verse. A group of three, standing apart from the rest, connect\r\nthemselves with the subject of the _Canzoniere_. The first describes the\r\nravages of the plague at Avignon; the second mourns over the death of\r\npoetry in the person of Laura, who fell a victim on April 6, 1348; the\r\nthird is a dirge sung by the shepherdesses over her grave. One, lastly, a\r\nneo-classic companion to Theocritus' tale of Galatea, recounts the poet's\r\nunrequited homage to Daphne of the Laurels, thus again suggesting the\r\nidealized source of Petrarch's inspiration. This poem is not only the gem\r\nof the series, but embodies the mythopoeic spirit of classical imagination\r\nin a manner unknown in the later days of the renaissance.\r\n\r\nThe, eclogues, twelve in number, appear to have been mostly composed\r\nabout the middle of the fourteenth century. In the days of Petrarch the\r\nart of Latin verse was yet far from the perfection it attained in those of\r\nPoliziano and Vida; it was a clumsy vehicle in comparison with the vulgar\r\ntongue, which he affected to despise while setting therein the standard\r\nfor future ages. Nevertheless, Petrarch's Latin poems bear witness to the\r\nnatural genius for composition and expression to which we owe the\r\n_Canzoniere_. The _editio princeps_ of the pastorals appeared in the form\r\nof a beautifully printed folio at Cologne in 1473, ninety-nine years after\r\nthe poet's death. They were entitled _Eglogae_[26] (i.e. _aeglogae_), by\r\nwhich, as Dr. Johnson remarked, Petrarch, finding no appropriate meaning\r\nin the form _eclogae_, 'meant to express the talk of goatherds, though it\r\nwill only mean the talk of goats.'\r\n\r\nNo two men ever won for themselves more diverse literary reputations than\r\nPetrarch and his friend Boccaccio. The Latin eclogue is one of their few\r\npoints of literary contact. The bucolic collections contain no less than\r\nsixteen such poems from the pen of the younger writer[27], which, though\r\nnot devoid of merit as poetical exercises, show that as a metrist\r\nBoccaccio fell almost as far short of his friend in the learned as in the\r\nvulgar tongue. They were composed at various dates, mostly, it would\r\nappear, after 1360, though some are certainly earlier; and it would be\r\ndifficult to say whether to him or to Petrarch belonged the honour of\r\nreviving the form, were it not that, both in the poems themselves and in\r\nhis correspondance, he explicitly mentions Petrarch as his master in the\r\nkind[28]. In any case the dates of composition must cover a wide period,\r\nfor the poems reflect varions phases of his life. 'Le Egloghe del\r\nBoccaccio,' says an Italian critic, 'rappresentano tutta la vita\r\npsicologica del poeta, dalle febbri d'amore alle febbri ascetiche.' The\r\namorous eclogues, to which in later life Boccaccio attached little\r\nimportance, are early; several are historical in subject and are probably\r\nof later date, though one may be as early as 1348; there are others of a\r\nreligions nature which belong to the author's later years. The allusions\r\nin these poems are so obscure that it would in most cases be hopeless to\r\nseek to unravel the meaning had not the author left us a key in a letter\r\nto Martino da Signa, prior of the Augustinians. Many of the subjects are\r\npurely conventional, such as those of the early poems on the loves of the\r\nshepherds, the historical panegyrics and laments, and the satire on rich\r\nmisers. The same may be said of a dispute on the respective merits of\r\npoetry and commerce, and of a poem in praise of poetry; although the\r\nformer has an obvious relation to the author's own circumstances, and the\r\nlatter appears to be inspired by genuine enthusiasm and love of art. The\r\nforces of confusion that have dogged the pastoral in all ages show\r\nthemselves where the poet tells a Christian fable in pagan guise; the\r\nantithesis of human and divine love, while suggesting Petrarch's influence\r\nover his life, is a theme that runs throughout medieval philosophy and was\r\nlater embodied by Spenser in his _Hymns_. One poem stands out from the\r\nrest somewhat after the manner of Petrarch's _Daphne_. In it Boccaccio\r\ntells us, under the thinnest veil of pastoral, how his daughter Violante,\r\ndead in childhood many years before, appeared to him bearing tidings of\r\nthe land beyond the grave. The theme is the same as that of the almost\r\ncontemporary _Pearl_; and in treating it Boccaccio achieves something of\r\nthe sweetness and pathos of the English poem. One eclogue, finally, the\r\n_Valle tenebrosa (Vallis Opaca)_, which appears to owe something to\r\nDante's description of hell, is probably historical in its intention, but\r\nthe gloss explains _obscurum per obscurius_, and we can only suppose that\r\nthe author intended that the inner sense should remain a mystery.\r\n\r\nWhen Boccaccio wrote, the eclogue had not yet degenerated into the\r\nliterary convention it became in the following century; and, though he was\r\nno doubt tempted to the use of the form by Vergilian tradition and the\r\nexample of Petrarch, he must also have followed therein a natural\r\ninclination and no mere dictate of fashion. Even in these poems the\r\nhumanity of the writer's personality makes itself felt. While Laura tends\r\nto fade into a personification of poetry, and Petrarch's strongest\r\nconvictions find expression through the mouth of St. Peter, we feel that\r\nbehind Boccaccio's humanistic exercise lies his own amorous passion, his\r\nown religious enthusiasm, his own fatherly tenderness and love. His\r\neclogues, however, never attained the same reputation as Petrarch's, and\r\nremained in manuscript till the appearance of Giunta's bucolic collection\r\nof 1504.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs humanism advanced and the golden age of the renaissance approached,\r\nLatin bucolic writers sprang up and multiplied. The fullest\r\ncollection--that printed by Oporinus at Basel in March, 1546--contains the\r\npoems of thirty-eight authors, and even this makes no pretence of giving\r\nthose of the middle ages. The collection, however, ranges from Calpurnius\r\nto Castalio (i.e. the French theologian Sébastien Châteillon), and\r\nincludes the work of Petrarca, Boccaccio, Spagnuoli, Urceo, Pontano,\r\nSannazzaro, Erasmus, Vida, and others. There is a strong family likeness\r\nin the pastoral verse of these authors, and the majority are devoid of\r\nindividual interest. A few, however, merit separate notice.\r\n\r\nIt was in the latter half of the fifteenth century that the renaissance\r\neclogue, abandoning its last claims to poetic inspiration, assumed its\r\ndefinitive form in the works of Battista Spagnuoli, more commonly known\r\nfrom the place of his birth by the name of Mantuanus. His eclogues, ten in\r\nnumber, were accepted by the sixteenth century as models of pastoral\r\ncomposition, inferior to those of Vergil alone, were indeed any\r\ninferiority allowed. Starting with the simple theme of love, the author\r\nproceeds to depict its excess in the love-lunes of the distraught Amyntas.\r\nThence he passes to one of those satires on women in which the fifteenth\r\ncentury delighted, so bitter, that when Thomas Harvey came to translate it\r\nin 1656 he felt constrained, for his credit's sake, to add the note,\r\n'What the author meant of all, the translater intends only of ill\r\nwomen[29].' There follows the old complaint of the niggardliness of rich\r\npatrons towards poor poets, and a satire on the luxury of city life. The\r\nremaining poems are ecclesiastical. One is in praise of the religious\r\nlife, another describes the simple faith of the country folk and the joys\r\nof conversion; finally, we have a satire on the abuses of Rome, and a\r\ndiscussion on points of theological controversy. None of these subjects\r\npossess the least novelty; the author's merit, if merit it can be called,\r\nlies in having stamped them with their definitive form for the use of\r\nsubsequent ages. Combined with this lack of originality, however, it is\r\neasy to trace a strong personal element in the bitterness of the satire\r\nthat pervades many of the themes, the orthodox eclogue on conversion\r\nstanding in curious contrast with that on ecclesiastical abuses.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to account for Spagnuoli's popularity, but the curiously\r\nrepresentative quality of his work was no doubt in part the cause. His\r\npoems were what, through the changing fashions of centuries, men had come\r\nto expect of bucolic verse. They crystallized into a standard mould\r\nwhatever in pastoral, whether classical or renaissance, was most obviously\r\nand easily reducible to a type, and so attained the position of models\r\nbeyond which it was needless to go. They were first printed in 1498, and\r\nwent through a number of editions during the author's lifetime. As a young\r\nman--and it is to his earlier years that the bulk of the eclogues must be\r\nattributed--Spagnuoli was noted for the elegance of his Latin verse; but\r\nhis facility led him into over-production, and Tiraboschi reports his\r\nlater writings as absolutely unreadable. He was of Spanish extraction, as\r\nhis name implies, became a Carmelite, and rose to be general of the order,\r\nbut retired in 1515, the year before his death.\r\n\r\nThree eclogues are extant from the pen of Pontano, a distinguished\r\nhumanist at the court of Ferdinand I and his successors at Naples, and a\r\nLatin poet of considerable grace and feeling. His poems were first\r\npublished by Aldus in 1505, two years after his death. In one\r\ncharacteristic composition he laments the loss of his wife, to whom he was\r\ndeeply attached; another introduces under a pastoral name his greater\r\ndisciple Sannazzaro[30].\r\n\r\nJacopo Sannazzaro, known to humanism as Actius Sincerus, disciple of the\r\n'Accademia Pontana,' and editor of his master's works, the greatest\r\nexplorer, if not the greatest exponent, of the mysteries of Arcadia, was\r\nborn of parents of Spanish origin at Naples in 1458. His boyhood was spent\r\nat San Cipriano, but he soon returned to Naples, where he fell in love\r\nwith Carmosina Bonifacia. His passion does not appear to have been\r\nreciprocated, but the lady has her place in literature as the Phillis of\r\nthe eclogues. He attached himself to the court of Frederick of Aragon,\r\nwhom he followed into exile in France. Returning to Naples after his\r\npatron's death in 1503, he again fell in love, this time with a certain\r\nCassandra Marchesa, to whom he continued to pay court, _more Platonico_,\r\ntill his death in 1530. He is said to have died at her house.\r\n\r\nTo his Italian work I shall have to return later; here it is his five\r\nLatin piscatory eclogues that demand notice. There is nothing in the\r\nsubject-matter to arrest attention--they consist of a lament for\r\nCarmosina, a lover's complaint, a singing match, a panegyric, and a poem\r\nin honour of Cassandra--but the form is interesting. Of course the claim\r\nsometimes put forward for Sannazzaro, as the inventor of the piscatory\r\neclogue, ignores various passages in Theocritus, notably the twenty-first\r\nIdyl, whence he presumably borrowed the idea. But it is certainly\r\nrefreshing, after wandering in an unreal Sicily and an imaginary Arcadia,\r\nand listening to shepherds discourse of the abuses of the Roman Curia, to\r\ndive into the waters of the bay of Naples, or wanton in fancy along its\r\nsunlit shore from the low rocks of Baiae to the sheer cliffs of Sorrento,\r\nand to feel that, even though Jacopo was no Neapolitan fisher-boy, and\r\nCarmosina no nymph of Posilipo, yet the poet had at least before him the\r\nblue water and the dark rocks, and in his heart the love that formed the\r\ntheme of his song[31].\r\n\r\nSannazzaro also wrote a mythological poem entitled _Salices_, in which\r\ncertain nymphs pursued by satyrs are changed by Diana into willows. The\r\ntale was evidently suggested by Ovid, and cannot strictly be classed as\r\npastoral, though it may have helped to fix in pastoral convention the\r\ncharacter of the satyr; who, however, at no time enjoyed a very savoury\r\nreputation. The Latin works were first published at Naples in 1536, and\r\nthough far from rivalling the popularity of the _Arcadia_, went through\r\nseveral editions.\r\n\r\nThe Latin eclogues of the renaissance are distinguished from all other\r\nforms of allegory by the obscure and recondite allusions that they\r\naffected. There were few among their authors for whom the narration of\r\nsimple loves and sorrows or the graces of untutored nature possessed any\r\nattraction; we find them either making their shepherds openly discuss\r\ncontemporary affairs, or more often clothing their references to actual\r\nevents in a sort of pastoral allegory, fatuous as regards its form and\r\nobscure as regards its content. Tityrus and Mopsus are alternately lovers,\r\ncourtiers and spiritual pastors; Pan, when he does not conceal under his\r\nshaggy outside the costly robes of a prince, is a strange abortive\r\nmonster, drawing his attributes in part from pagan superstition, in part\r\nfrom Christian piety; a libel upon both. The seed sown by Petrarch and\r\nBoccaccio bore fruit only too freely. The writers of eclogues, either\r\ndebarred from or incapable of originality, sought distinction by ever more\r\nand more elaborate and involved allusions; and their works, in their own\r\nday held the more sublime the more incomprehensible they were, are now the\r\ndespair of those who would wring from them any semblance of meaning.\r\n\r\nThe absurdities of the conventional pastoral did not, indeed, pass\r\naltogether unnoticed in their own day, for early in the sixteenth century\r\nTeofilo Folengo composed his _Zanitonella_ in macaronic verse. It consists\r\nof eclogues and poems in hexameter and elegiac metre ridiculing polite\r\npastoralism through contrast with the crudities of actual rusticity. In\r\nthe same manner Berni travestied the courtly pastoral of vernacular\r\nwriters in his realistic pictures of village love. But though the satirist\r\nmight find ample scope for his wit in anatomizing the foible of the day,\r\nfashionable society continued none the less to encourage the exquisite\r\ninanity, and to be flattered by the elegant obscurity, of the allegorical\r\npastoral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1481 appeared an Italian translation of the Bucolics of Vergil from the\r\npen of Bernardo Pulci. The same volume also contained a collection of\r\neclogues in the vernacular by various authors, none of which have any\r\nparticular interest beyond what attaches to them as practically heading\r\nthe list of Italian pastorals[32]. It will be noticed that these poems\r\ncorrespond in date with the later school of Latin bucolic writers,\r\nrepresented by Mantuan; and the vernacular compositions developed\r\napproximately parallel to, though usually in imitation of, those in the\r\nlearned tongue. But the fourteenth-century school of Petrarch had not been\r\nentirely without its representative in Italian. At least one poem included\r\nby Boccaccio in his _Ameto_ is a strict eclogue, composed throughout in\r\n_terza rima_, which was destined to become the standard verse-form for\r\n'pastoral,' as _ottava rima_ for 'rustic,' composition. The poem is a\r\ncontention between an upland and a lowland shepherd, and begins in genuine\r\npastoral fashion:\r\n\r\n    Come Titan del seno dell' aurora\r\n      Esce, così con le mie pecorelle\r\n      I monti cerco sema far dimora.\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly differentiated from many similar compositions in Latin--and\r\nthe distinction is of some importance--in that the interest is purely\r\npastoral; no political or religious allusions being discernible under the\r\narguments of the somewhat quarrelsome swains[33]. This peculiarity is on\r\nthe whole characteristic of the later vernacular pastoral likewise, which,\r\nafter the appearance of the collection of 1481, soon became extremely\r\ncommon, Siena and Urbino, Ferrara, Bologna and Padua, Florence and Naples,\r\nall alike bearing practical witness to the popularity of the kind[34].\r\n\r\nIn 1506 Castiglione[35] and Cesare Gonzaga, in the disguise of shepherds,\r\nrecited an eclogue interspersed with songs before the court of Duke\r\nGuidubaldo at Urbino. The Duchess Elizabeth was among the spectators. The\r\n_Tirsi,_ as it is called, begins with the simple themes of pastoral\r\ncomplaint, whence by swift transition it passes to a panegyric of the\r\ncourt and the circle of the _Cortegiano_. It was not the first attempt at\r\nbringing the pastoral upon the boards, since Poliziano's _Orfeo_ with its\r\npurely bucolic opening had been performed as early as 1471; but\r\nCastiglione's _ecloga rappresentativa_ was the first of any note to depend\r\npurely on the pastoral form and to introduce on the stage the convention\r\nof the allegorical pastoral. Some years later a further step was taken in\r\nthe dramatization of the eclogue by Luigi Tansillo in his _Due pelegrini_,\r\nperformed at Messina in 1538, though composed and probably originally\r\nacted some ten years before. It is through these and similar poems that we\r\nshall have to trace the gradual evolution of the pastoral drama in a later\r\nsection of this work. Tansillo was likewise the author, both of a poem\r\ncalled _Il Vendemmiatore_, one of those obscene debauches of fancy which\r\nthrow a lurid light on the luxurious imagination of the age, and of a\r\ndidactic work, _Il Podere_, in which, as his editor somewhat naïvely\r\nremarks, 'ci rende amabile la campagna e l'agricoltura[36].'\r\n\r\nThe practice of eclogue-writing soon became no less general in the\r\nvernacular than in Latin, and the band of pastoral poets included men so\r\ndifferent in temperament as Machiavelli, who left a 'Capitolo pastorale'\r\namong his miscellaneous works, and Ariosto, whose eclogue on the\r\nconspiracy contrived in 1506 against Alfonso d'Este was published from\r\nmanuscript in 1835. The fashion of the piscatory eclogue, set by\r\nSannazzaro in Latin, was followed in Italian by his fellow-citizen\r\nBernardino Rota, and later by Bernardino Baldi of Urbino, Abbot of\r\nGuastalla, in whose poems we are able at times to detect a ring of simple\r\nand refreshing sincerity.\r\n\r\nThough, as will be understood even from the brief summary given above, the\r\nallusive element is not wholly absent from these poems, it is nevertheless\r\ntrue, as already said, that it appears less persistently than in the Latin\r\nworks, the weighty matters of religion and politics being as a rule\r\navoided. The reason is perhaps not far to seek, since, being in the vulgar\r\ntongue, they appealed to a wider and less learned audience, before whom it\r\nmight have been injudicious to utter too strong an opinion on questions of\r\nchurch and state.\r\n\r\nSo far the pastoral poetry of Italy had been composed exclusively in the\r\nliterary Tuscan of the day. To Florence and to Lorenzo de' Medici in\r\nparticular is due the honour of having first introduced the rustic speech\r\nof the people. His two poems written in the language of the peasants about\r\nFlorence, _La Nencia da Barberino_ and a canzonet _In morte della Nencia_,\r\npossess a grace to which the quaintness of the diction adds point and\r\nflavour. A short extract must suffice to illustrate the style.\r\n\r\n    Ben si potrà tener avventurato\r\n      Chi sia marito di sì bella moglie;\r\n      Ben si potrà tener in buon dì nato\r\n      Chi arà quel fioraliso senza foglie;\r\n      Ben si potrà tenersi consolato\r\n      Che si contenti tutte le sue voglie\r\n      D' aver la Nencia, e tenersela in braccio\r\n      Morbida e bianca, che pare un sugnaccio.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Nenciozza mia, vuo' tu un poco fare\r\n      Meco a la neve per quel salicale?--\r\n      Sì, volentier, ma non me la sodare\r\n      Troppo, chè tu non mi facessi male.--\r\n      Nenciozza mia, deh non ti dubitare,\r\n      Chè l' amor ch' io ti porto sì è tale,\r\n      Che quando avessi mal, Nenciozza mia,\r\n      Con la mia lingua te lo leveria.\r\n\r\nThis form of composition at once became fashionable. Luigi Pulci[37]\r\ncomposed his _Beca di Dicomano_, which attained almost equal success and\r\npassed for the work of Lorenzo. It is, however, a far inferior production,\r\nin which the quaintness of the model is replaced by coarse caricature and\r\nits delicate rusticity by a cruder realism. Other imitations followed, but\r\nnone bear comparison with Lorenzo's poem[38]. It is in thought and\r\nexpression rather than in actual language that these poems distinguish\r\nthemselves from the literary pastoral. More noticeably dialectal is an\r\nanonymous _Pescatoria amorosa_ printed about 1550. It is a Venetian\r\nserenade sung in the persons of fishermen, and possesses a certain grace\r\nof language:\r\n\r\n    Cortese donne, belle innamorae,\r\n      Donzelle, vedovette, e maridae,\r\n      Ascholte ste parole, che le no se cortelae,\r\n      Che intendere la causa del vegnir in ste contrae[39].\r\n\r\nSymonds and D'Ancona alike remark, with perfect truth, that Lorenzo's\r\nrustic style, in spite of its sympathetic grace, is not altogether\r\ndissociated from burlesque. While free from the artificiality of court\r\npastoral, it is equally distinct from the natural simplicity of the\r\nTheocritean idyl. Its flavour depends upon the half cynical, half kindly,\r\namusement afforded by the contrast between the _naïveté_ of the country\r\nand the familiar and conventional polish of town life. This theme had\r\nalready caught the fancy of the song-writers of the fourteenth century,\r\nwho produced some of the most delightful examples of native and\r\nunconventional pastoral anywhere to be found[40]. Franco Sacchetti the\r\nnovelist, for example, gives us a series of charming vignettes of country\r\nlife and scenery, but always from the point of view of the town observer.\r\nOne poem of his in particular gained wide popularity, and a modernized and\r\nsomewhat altered version was iater printed among the works of Poliziano.\r\nIt was originally a _ballata_, but I prefer to quote some stanzas from the\r\ntraditional version:\r\n\r\n    Vaghe le montanine e pastorelle,\r\n      Donde venite sì leggiadre e belle?--\r\n\r\n    Vegnam dall' alpe, presso ad un boschetto;\r\n      Picciola capannella è il nostro sito;\r\n      Col padre e colla madre in picciol tetto,\r\n      Dove natura ci ha sempre nutrito,\r\n      Torniam la sera dal prato fiorito\r\n      Ch' abbiam pasciute nostre pecorelle.--\r\n\r\n    Ben si posson doler vostre bellezze,\r\n      Poichè tra valli e monti le mostrate,\r\n      Chè non è terra di sì grandi altezze\r\n      Che voi non foste degne ed onorate.\r\n      Ora mi dite, se vi contentate\r\n      Di star nell' alpe così poverelle?--\r\n\r\n    Più si contenta ciascuna di noi\r\n      Gire alla mandria, dietro alla pastura,\r\n      Più che non fate ciascuna di voi\r\n      Gire a danzare dentro a vostre mura;\r\n      Ricchezza non cerchiam, nè più ventura,\r\n      Se non be' fiori, e facciam ghirlandelle[41].\r\n\r\nOther writers besides Sacchetti produced songs of the sort, but in all\r\nalike the strictly pastoral element was accidental, and merged insensibly\r\ninto the more delicately romantic of the _novelle_ themes. The following\r\nlines touch on a situation familiar in later pastoral and also found in\r\nEnglish ballad poetry. They are by Alesso Donati, a contemporary of\r\nSacchetti's. A nun sings:\r\n\r\n    La dura corda e 'l vel bruno e la tonica\r\n      Gittar voglio e lo scapolo\r\n      Che mi tien qui rinchiusa e fammi monica;\r\n      Poi teco a guisa d'assetato giovane,\r\n      Non già che si sobbarcoli,\r\n      Venir me n' voglio ove fortuna piovane:\r\n\r\n    E son contenta star per serva e cuoca,\r\n      Chè men mi cocerò ch' ora mi cuoca[42].\r\n\r\nBut if pastoralism made its appearance in the lyric, the lyric equally\r\ninfluenced pastoral, for it is in the songs of the fifteenth century that\r\nwe first meet with that spirit of graceful melancholy sighing over the\r\ntransitoriness of earthly things, the germ of the _voluttà idillica_ of\r\nthe _Aminta_ and the _Pastor fido._ This vein is strong in Lorenzo's\r\ncharming carnival songs, which at once recall Villon's burden, 'Où sont\r\nles neiges d'antan?' and anticipate Tasso's warning:\r\n\r\n    Cangia, cangia consiglio,\r\n    Pazzerella che sei;\r\n    Che il pentirsi dassezzo nulla giova.\r\n\r\nThe 'triumph' of _Bacchus and Ariadne_, introduced with amorous nymphs and\r\nsatyrs, has the refrain:\r\n\r\n    Quant' è bella giovinezza,\r\n      Che si fugge tuttavia!\r\n      Chi vuol esser lieto, sia:\r\n      Di doman non c' è certezza.\r\n\r\nThe flower of lyric melancholy is already full blown. So, too, in another\r\ncarnival song of his:\r\n\r\n    Or che val nostra bellezza?\r\n      Se si perde, poco vale.\r\n      Viva amore e gentilezza!\r\n\r\n_Gentilezza, morbidezza_--the yielding fancy in the disguise of pity, the\r\nnerveless languor that passes for beauty--such is the dominant note of the\r\nsong upon men's lips in the troublous times of the renaissance[43].\r\n\r\nAnother of the outlying realms of pastoral is the mythological tale, more\r\nor less directly imitated from Ovid. The first to introduce it in\r\nvernacular literature was Boccaccio, who in his _Ninfale fiesolano_ uses\r\na pagan allegory to convey a favourite _novella_ theme. The shepherd\r\nAffrico loves a nymph of Diana, and the tale ends by the goddess changing\r\nher faithless votary into a fountain. It is written in somewhat cumbrous\r\n_ottava rima_, and seldom shows any conspicuous power of narrative.\r\nBelonging to the same class of composition, though of a very different\r\norder of poetic merit, is Lorenzo's wonderfully graceful tale of _Ambra_.\r\nThe grace lies in the telling, for the plot was probably already stale\r\nwhen Phoebus and Daphne were protagonists. The poem recounts how the\r\nwood-nymph Ambra, beloved of Lauro, is pursued by the river-god Ombrone,\r\none of Arno's tributary divinities, and praying to Diana in her hour of\r\nneed, is by her transformed into a rock[44]. Lorenzo's _Selva d'amore_ and\r\n_Caccia col falcone_ might also be mentioned in the same connexion.\r\n\r\nLess pastoral in motive and less connected in narrative, but of even\r\ngreater importance in the formation of pastoral taste, is the famous\r\n_Giostra_ written in honour of the young Giuliano de' Medici. I have\r\nalready more than once had occasion to mention its author, Angelo\r\nAmbrogini, better known from the place of his birth as Poliziano or\r\nPolitian[45], the contemporary, dependent, and fellow-littérateur of\r\nLorenzo il Magnifico, and the greatest scholar and learned writer of the\r\nItalian renaissance. As the author of the _Orfeo_ he will occupy our\r\nattention when we come to trace the evolution of the pastoral drama.\r\nThough he left no poems belonging to the recognized forms of pastoral\r\ncomposition, his work constantly borders upon the kind, and evinces a\r\ngenuine sympathy with rustic life which makes the ascription to him of the\r\nalready quoted modernization of Sacchetti not inappropriate. He left\r\nseveral other pieces of a similar nature, some of which at least are known\r\nto be adaptations of popular songs[46]. Such, for instance, is the\r\nirregular _canzone_ beginning:\r\n\r\n    La pastorella si leva per tempo\r\n      Menando le caprette a pascer fuora,\r\n      Di fuora, fuora: la traditora\r\n      Co' suoi begli occhi la m' innamora,\r\n      E fa di mezza notte apparir giorno.\r\n\r\nThe _Giostra_ is composed, like its predecessors, in the octave stanza,\r\nand presents a series of pictures drawn from classical mythology or from\r\nthe poet's own imagination, adorned with all the physical beauty the study\r\nof antiquity could supply and a rich and refined taste crystallize into\r\nchastest jewellery of verse[47]. This blending of luxuriance and delicacy\r\nis the characteristic quality of Poliziano's and Lorenzo's poetry. It is\r\nadmirably expressed in the phrase of a recent critic, 'the decorum of\r\nthings exquisite.' After the lapse of another half-century, during which\r\nthe renaissance advanced from its graceful youth to the full bloom of its\r\nmaturity, appeared the _Ninfa tiberina_ of Francesco Maria Molza. 'The\r\n_voluttà idillica_[48],' writes Symonds, 'which opened like a rosebud in\r\nthe _Giostra_, expands full petals in the _Ninfa tiberina_; we dare not\r\nshake them, lest they fall.' Like the earlier poem it possesses little\r\nnarrative unity--the taie of Eurydice introduced by way of illustration\r\noccupies more than a third of the whole--but every point is made the\r\noccasion of minute decoration of the richest beauty. It was written for\r\nFaustina Mancina, a celebrated courtesan, whose empire lay till the day of\r\nher death over the papal city. The wealth of sensuality and wit that made\r\na fatal seduction of Rome for Molza, scholar and libertine, is reflected\r\nas it were in the rich cadences and overwrought adornment of his verse.\r\nSuch compositions as these had a powerful influence over the tone of\r\nidyllic poetry. I have mentioned only a few out of a considerable list.\r\nThe _Driadeo d'amore_ earlier--a mythological medley variously ascribed in\r\ndifferent editions to Luca and to Luigi Pulci--and Marino's _Adone_ later,\r\nwere likewise among the works that went to form the courtly taste to which\r\nthe pastoral drama appealed. The detailed criticism, however, of such\r\ncompositions lies beyond the scope of this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must now return to an earlier period in order to follow the development\r\nof the pastoral romance. When dealing with _Daphnis and Chloe_ I pointed\r\nout that the Greek work could claim no part in the formation of the later\r\nprose pastoral. Between it and the work of Boccaccio and Sannazzaro there\r\nexists no such continuity of tradition as between the bucolics of the\r\nclassical Mantuan and those of his renaissance follower. The Italian\r\npastoral romance, in spite of its almost pedantic endeavour after\r\nclassical and mythological colouring, was as essentially a product of its\r\nage as the pastoral drama itself. So far as any influence on the evolution\r\nof the subsequent Arcadia was concerned, Longus might as well never have\r\nwritten of the pastures of Lesbos. Indeed, were we here concerned in\r\nassigning to its historical source each particular trait in individual\r\nworks, rather than in tracing the general development of an idea, it would\r\nbe casier to distinguish a faint and slightly cynical reminiscence of\r\n_Daphnis and Chloe _ in the _Aminta_ and _Pastor fido_ than in the _Ameto_\r\nor the _Arcadia_.\r\n\r\nIn his pastoral romance, 'Ameto, ovvero Commedia delie ninfe fiorentine,'\r\nBoccaccio set a fashion in literature, namely the intermingling for\r\npurposes of narration of prose and verse[49], in which he was followed a\r\ncentury and a half later by Pietro Bembo, the Socrates of Castiglione's\r\nrenaissance Symposium, in his dialogue on love entitled _Gli Asolani_, and\r\nby Jacopo Sannazzaro in his still more famous _Arcadia_. The _Ameto_ is\r\none of Boccaccio's early compositions, written about 1341, after his\r\nreturn from Naples, but before he had gained his later mastery of\r\nlanguage. It is not unfairly characterized by Symonds as 'a tissue of\r\npastoral tales, descriptions, and versified interludes, prolix in style\r\nand affected with pedantic erudition.' It is, however, possible to\r\nunderrate its merits, and it would be easy to overlook its historical\r\nimportance. Ameto is a rude hunter of the neighbourhood of Florence. One\r\nday, while in the woods, he discovers a company of nymphs resting by a\r\nstream, and overhears the song of the beautiful Lia. His rough nature is\r\ntouched by the sweetness of the music and he falls in love with the\r\nsinger. Their meetings are interrupted by the advent of winter, but he\r\nfinds her again at the feast of Venus, when shepherds, fauns, and nymphs\r\nforgather at the temple of the goddess. In this company Lia proposes that\r\neach of the nymphs present, seven in number, shall narrate the story of\r\nher love. This they in turn do, each ending with a song of praise to the\r\ngods; and Ameto feels his love burn for each in turn as he listens to\r\ntheir tales. When the last has ended a sudden brightness shines around and\r\n'there descended with wondrous noise a column of pure flame, even such as\r\nby night went before the Israelitish people in the desert places,' Out of\r\nthe brightness cornes the voice of Venus:\r\n\r\n    Io son luce del cielo unica e trina,\r\n      Principio e fine di ciascuna cosa,\r\n      Del quai men fù, nè fia nulla vicina.\r\n\r\nAmeto, though half blinded by the heavenly effulgence, sees a new joy and\r\nbeauty shine upon the faces of the nymphs, and understands that the\r\nflame-shrouded presence is that, not of the wanton _mater cupidinum_, but\r\nof the goddess of divine fire who comes to reveal to him the mysteries of\r\nlove. Cleansed of his grosser nature by a baptismal rite, in which each of\r\nthe nymphs performs some symbolic ceremonial, he feels heavenly love\r\nreplacing human in his heart, and is able to bear undazzled the radiance\r\nof the divine purity. He salutes the goddess with a song:\r\n\r\n    O diva luce, quale in tre persone\r\n      Ed una essenza il ciel governi e 'l mondo\r\n      Con giusto amore ed eterna ragione,\r\n    Dando legge alle stelle, ed al ritondo\r\n      Moto del sole, principe di quelle,\r\n      Siccome discerniamo in questo fondo[50].\r\n\r\nVarious interpretations have been suggested for this work, with its\r\npreposterous mixture of pagan and Christian motives. This peculiarity,\r\nwhich we have already met with in Boccaccio's eclogues, and in his\r\n_Ninfale fiesolano_, was indeed one of the most persistent as it was one\r\nof the least admirable characteristics of pastoral composition. Francesco\r\nSansovino, who edited the _Ameto_ in 1545, discovered real personages\r\nunderlying the characters of the romance. Fiammetta is introduced by name,\r\nand her lover Caleone can hardly be other than Boccaccio. More recent\r\ncommentators are probably right in detecting an allegorical intention. The\r\nseven nymphs, according to them, represent the four cardinal and three\r\ntheological virtues, and their stories are to be interpreted symbolically.\r\nThis view derives support from the baptismal ceremony, in which after the\r\npublic lustration one of the nymphs removes the scales from Ameto's eyes,\r\nwhile another, 'breathing between his lips, kindled within him a flame\r\nsuch as he had never felt before.' In these ministrants it is not\r\ndifficult to recognize the virtues respectively of faith and love. Ameto\r\nmay be taken as typical of humanity, tamed of its savage nature by love,\r\nand through the service of the virtues led to the knowledge of the divine\r\nessence. The conception of love as a civilizing and humanizing power\r\nalready underlay the sensuous stanzas of the _Ninfale fiesolano_, while\r\nthe later part of the romance was not uninfluenced by recollections of the\r\n_Divine Comedy_[51]. It is true that a modern mind will with difficulty be\r\nable to reconcile the amorous confessions of the nymphs with the\r\ncharacteristics of the virtues, but in Boccaccio's day the tradition of\r\nthe _Gesta Romanorum_ was still strong, and the age that mysticized\r\nVergil, and moralized Ovid, was capable of much in the way of allegorical\r\ninterpretation[52].\r\n\r\nThe point to which this allegorical interpretation can legitimately be\r\ncarried need not trouble us here. Having set himself to characterize the\r\nvirtues, it is moreover likely enough that Boccaccio sought at the same\r\ntime to connect his figures more or less definitely with actual persons.\r\nIt is sufficient for our present purpose if we recognize in the _Ameto_\r\nsomething of the same triple intention which, not to put too fine a\r\nmetaphysical point upon the parallel, we meet with in Dante and in the\r\n_Faery Queen_. Having fashioned in accordance with these motives the\r\nframework of his book, Boccaccio further concerned himself but little with\r\nthis philosophical intention, and the allegorical setting having served\r\nits artistic purpose of linking them together into one connected whole, it\r\nwas upon the detail of the narratives themselves that the author's\r\nattention was concentrated. It is, however, just in this artistic purpose\r\nof the setting that one of the chief interests of the _Ameto_ lies; for if\r\nin the mingling of verse and prose it is the forerunner of the _Arcadia_,\r\nin the linking together of a series of isolated stories it anticipates\r\nBoccaccio's own _Decameron_.\r\n\r\nWhile there is little that is distinctly bucolic about the _Ameto_, the\r\natmosphere is eminently pastoral in the wider sense. Nymphs and shepherds,\r\nforesters and fauns meet at the temple of Venus; the limpid fountains and\r\nshady laurels belong essentially to the conventional landscape, whether of\r\nSicily, of Arcadia, or of the hills overlooking the valley of the Arno.\r\nThe Italian imagination was not careful to differentiate between field and\r\nforest: _favola boschereccia_ was used synonymously with _commedia\r\npastorale_; _drammi dei boschi_ is a term which covers the whole of the\r\npastoral drama. But what really gives the _Ameto_ its importance in the\r\nhistory of pastoral literature is the manner in which, undisturbed by its\r\nreligions and allegorical machinery, it introduces us to a purely sensual\r\nand pagan paradise, in which love with all its pains and raptures reigns\r\nsupreme.\r\n\r\nThe narratives of the nymphs, and indeed the whole of the prose portions\r\nof the work, are composed in a style of surcharged and voluptuous beauty,\r\ncongested with lengthy periods, and accumulated superlatives and relative\r\nclauses, which, in its endeavour to maintain itself and its subject at the\r\nhighest possible pitch, only succeeds in being intensely and almost\r\nuniformly monotonous and dull. It is perfectly true that the work\r\npossesses some at least of the qualities of its defects. There are\r\npassages which argue a feeling for beauty, none the less real for being of\r\na somewhat conventional order, while we not seldom detect a certain rich\r\nluxuriance about the descriptions; but it must be admitted that on the\r\nwhole the style exhibits most of Boccaccio's faults and few of his merits.\r\nThe verse interspersed throughout is in _terza rima_, and offers small\r\nattraction to the ordinary reader: 'meschinissima cosa' is a verdict\r\nwhich, if somewhat severe, will probably find few to contradict it.\r\n\r\nIn a certain passage, speaking of Poliziano's _Orfeo_, Symonds remarks\r\nthat 'while Arcady became the local dreamland of the new ideal, Orpheus\r\ntook the place of its hero.' Without inquiring too closely how far the\r\nwriters of the renaissance actually connected the hero of music, as a\r\npower of civilization, with their newly discovered country, it is\r\ninteresting to note that the earliest work in the Italian language\r\ncontaining in however amoebean a state the pastoral ideal opens with an\r\nallusion to Orpheus.\r\n\r\n    Quella vertù, che già l'ardito Orfeo\r\n      Mosse a cercar le case di Plutone,\r\n      Allor che forse lieta gli rendeo\r\n    La cercata Euridice a condizione,\r\n      E dal suon vinto dell' arguto legno,\r\n      E dalla nota della sua canzone,\r\n    Per forza tira il mio debile ingegno\r\n      A cantar le tue Iode, o Citerea,\r\n      Insieme con le forze del tuo regno[53].\r\n\r\nOrpheus, however, does not stand alone. Venus, Phoebus, Mars, Cupid, and\r\nfinally Jove, are each in turn invoked, to say nothing of the incidental\r\nmention of Aeneas, Mirra, and Europa. This love of mythology in and out of\r\nseason is one of the most prominent features of the work. One of the\r\nnymphs describes her youth in the following words:\r\n\r\n  il padre mio .... visse eccellentissimo ne' beni pubblici tra' reggenti,\r\n  e de' beni degli iddii copioso: me a lui donata da loro, nominò Mopsa, e\r\n  vedentemi nella giovanetta età mostrante già bella forma, ai servigi\r\n  dispose di Pallade, la quale me benivola ricevente nelle sante grotte\r\n  del cavallo Gorgoneo, tra le sapientissime Muse commise, là dov' io\r\n  gustai l'acque Castalie, e l'altezza di Cirra tentante, le stelle cercai\r\n  con ferma mano; e i pallidi visi, quelli luoghi colenti, sempre con\r\n  riverenza seguii; e molte volte sonando Apollo la cetera sua, lui nel\r\n  mezzo delle nove Muse ascoltai[54].\r\n\r\nShe continues for pages in the same strain with illustrative allusions to\r\nCaius Julius, Claudius, and Britannicus.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of devoting to the _Ameto_ an altogether disproportionate\r\namount of the space at my disposai I must before passing on attempt to\r\ngive some notion of the kind of narrative contained in the romance, all\r\nthe more so as it is little known except to students. With this object I\r\nhave translated a characteristic passage from the tale of Agape[55].\r\n\r\n  I came from my home nigh unto the temple, before whose altars, with due\r\n  devotion, I began thus to pray: 'O Venus, full of pity, sacred goddess\r\n  whose altars I am joyful to approach, lend thou thy merciful ears unto\r\n  my prayer; for I come to thee a young girl, though fairly fashioned yet\r\n  ill-starred in love, fearful lest my empty years lead comfortless to a\r\n  chill old age; therefore, if my beauty merit that I be counted among thy\r\n  followers, enter thou into my breast who so desire thee, and grant that\r\n  in the love of a youth not unworthy of my beauty, and through whom my\r\n  wasted hours may be with delight made good, I may feel those fires of\r\n  thine which many times and endlessly I have heard praised.' I know not\r\n  whether while I was thus engrossed in prayer I fell on sleep, and\r\n  sleeping saw those things whereof I am about to tell, or whether,\r\n  indeed, I was rapt thence in bodily form to see them; all I can tell is\r\n  that suddenly I found myself borne through the heavens in a gleaming\r\n  chariot drawn by white doves, and that inclining my eyes to things below\r\n  I beheld the fruitful earth shrunk to a narrow room, and the rivers\r\n  thereof after the fashion of serpents; and after that I had left behind\r\n  the pleasant lands of Italy and the rugged mountains of Emathia, I\r\n  beheld the waters of the Dircean fount and the ancient walls raised by\r\n  the sound of Amphion's lyre, and soon there appeared to me the pleasant\r\n  Cytherean mount, and on it resting the holy chariots drawn by the\r\n  spotless birds. Whereon having alighted I went straying, alike uncertain\r\n  of the way and of the fortune that might await me, when, as to Aeneas\r\n  upon the Afric shore, so to me there amid the myrtles there appeared the\r\n  goddess I had invoked, and I was filled with wonder such as I had never\r\n  known before. She was disrobed except for the thinnest purple veil,\r\n  which hid but little of her form, falling in double curve with many\r\n  artful foldings over her left side; her face shone even as the sun, and\r\n  her head was adorned with great length of golden hair rippling down over\r\n  white shoulders; her eyes flashed with light never seen till then. Why\r\n  should I labour to tell the loveliness of her mouth and of her snowy\r\n  neck, of her marble breast and of her every part, since to do so lies so\r\n  far beyond my powers, and even where I able, hardly should my words gain\r\n  credence? But whereas she was now at hand I bowed my knees before her\r\n  godhead, and with such voice as I could command, repeated my petition in\r\n  her presence. She listened thereto, and approaching bade me rise,\r\n  saying, 'Follow me; thy prayer is heard, thy desire granted,' and\r\n  thereupon withdrew me to a somewhat loftier spot. There hidden amidst\r\n  the dense foliage she discovered to me her only son, upon whom gazing in\r\n  admiration, I found his beauty such that in all things did he appear\r\n  fashioned like unto her, except in so far as being he a god and she a\r\n  goddess. O how oft, remembering Psyche, I counted her happy and unhappy;\r\n  happy in the possession of such a husband, unhappy in his loss, most\r\n  happy in receiving him again from Jove. But even as I gazed, he, beating\r\n  the air with his sacred wings that gleamed with clearest gold, departed\r\n  with his load of newly fashioned arrows from those parts, and at the\r\n  bidding of the goddess I turned to the spring wherein he used to temper\r\n  his golden darts fresh forged with fiercest fire. Its silver waters,\r\n  gushing of themselves from the earth and shaded along the margin by a\r\n  growth of myrtle and dogwood, were neither violated in their purity by\r\n  the approach of bird or beast, nor suffered aught from the sun's\r\n  distemperature, and as I leaned forward to catch the reflection of my\r\n  own figure I could discern the clear bottom free from every trace of\r\n  mud[56]. The goddess, for that the hour was already hot, had doffed her\r\n  transparent veil and plunged her into the cool water, and now commanded\r\n  me that having stripped I too should enter the spring. We were yet\r\n  disporting ourselves in the lovely fountain, when, raising my head and\r\n  gazing with longing eyes around, I saw amid the leaves a youth, pale and\r\n  shy of appearance, who with slow steps was advancing towards the sacred\r\n  water. As I looked on him he was pleasant in my eyes, but that he should\r\n  behold me naked filled me with shame, and I turned away to hide my\r\n  unwonted blushes. And in like manner at the sight of me he too changed\r\n  colour and was troubled; he stayed his steps and advanced no further.\r\n  Then at the pleasure of the goddess leaving the water we resumed our\r\n  apparel, and crowned with myrtle sought a neighbouring glade, full of\r\n  finest grass and diapered with many flowers, where in the freshness we\r\n  stretched our limbs to rest. Thereupon the goddess, having called the\r\n  youth to us, began to speak in these words: 'Agape, most dear to me,\r\n  this youth, Apyros by name, whom thou seest thus shy amid our glades,\r\n  shall satisfy thy longing; but see that with care thou preserve\r\n  inviolate our fires, which in thy heart thou shalt bear with thee\r\n  hence.' I was about to make answer when my tender breast was of a sudden\r\n  pierced by the flying arrow loosed by the strong hand of the son of her\r\n  who added these unto her former words: 'We give him thee as thy first\r\n  and only servant; he lacks nought but our fires, which, kindled even now\r\n  by thee in him, be it thy care to nourish, that the frost that bound him\r\n  like to Aglauros being driven from his heart, he may burn with the\r\n  divine fire no less than father Jove himself.' She ceased; and I,\r\n  trembling yet with fear, no sooner opened my lips to assent to her\r\n  command, than I found myself once more in prayer before her altars;\r\n  whereat marvelling not a little, and casting my eyes around in search of\r\n  Apyros, I became aware of the golden arrow in my breast, and near me the\r\n  pale youth, his intent gaze fixed upon me, and like me wounded by the\r\n  god; and so seeing him inflamed with a passion no other than that which\r\n  burned in me, I laughed, and filled with contentment and desire, made\r\n  sign to him to be of hopeful cheer.\r\n\r\nThe advance in style that marks the transition from the _Ameto_ to the\r\n_Arcadia_ must be largely accredited to Boccaccio himself. The language of\r\nthe _Decameron_ became the model of _cinquecento_ prose. Sannazzaro,\r\nhowever, wrote in evident imitation not of the structural method only, but\r\nof the actual style of the _Ameto_. Something, it is true, he added beyond\r\nthe greater mastery of literary form due to training. Even in his most\r\nluxuriant descriptions and most sensuous images we find that grace and\r\nclearness of vision which characterize the early poetry of the\r\nRenaissance proper, and combine in literature the luminous purity of\r\nBotticelli and the gem-like detail of Pinturicchio. The mythological\r\naffectation of the elder work appears in the younger modified, refined,\r\nsubordinated; there is the same delight in detailed description, but\r\nrelieved by greater variety of imagination; while, even in the most\r\nlaboured passages, there is a poetical feeling as well as a more\r\nsubjective manner, which, combined with a remarkable power of\r\nvisualization, saves them from the danger of the catalogue. Again, there\r\nis everywhere visible the same artificiality of style which characterizes\r\nthe _Ameto_, but purged of its more extravagant elements and less affected\r\nand conceited than it became in the works of Lyly and Sidney. Like the\r\n_Ameto_, lastly, but unlike its Spanish and English successors, the\r\n_Arcadia_ is purely pastoral, free from any chivalric admixture.\r\n\r\nThe narrative interest in the _Arcadia_ is of the slightest. It opens with\r\na description of the 'dilettevole piano, di ampiezza non molto spazioso,'\r\nlying at the summit of Parthenium, 'non umile monte della pastorale\r\nArcadia,' which was henceforth to be the abode sacred to the\r\nshepherd-folk. There, as in Vergil's Italy and in Browne's Devon, in\r\nChaucer's dreamland, and in the realm of the Faery Queen, 'son forse\r\ndodici o quindici alberi di tanto strana ed eccessiva bellezza, che\r\nchiunque li vedesse, giudicherebbe che la maestra natura vi si fosse con\r\nsommo diletto studiata in formarli.'[57] The shepherds, who are assembled\r\nwith their flocks, are about to seek their homes at the approach of night,\r\nwhen they meet Montano playing upon his pipe, and a musical contest ensues\r\nbetween him and Uranio. Next day is celebrated the feast of Pales, an\r\naccount of which is given at length, and is followed by a song in which\r\nGalicio sings the praises of his mistress Amaranta, of whom the narrator\r\nproceeds to give a minute description. After another singing-match between\r\nLogisto and Elpino the company betake themselves to the tomb of Androgeo,\r\nwhose praises are set forth in prose and rime. There follows a song by the\r\nold shepherd Opico, on the superiority of the 'former age'; after which\r\nCarino asks the narrator, Sincero--the pseudonym under which Sannazzaro\r\ntravelled in the realm of shepherds--to recount his history, which he\r\ndoes at length, ending with a lament in _sestina_ form. By way of\r\nconsoling him in his exile Carino, in return, tells the tale of his own\r\namorous adventures. Next the reverend Opico is induced to discourse of the\r\npowers of magic as the shepherds proceed to the sacred grove of Pan, who\r\nshares with Pales the honours of Arcadian worship, and to the games held\r\nat the tomb of sibyllic Massilia--a name under which Sannazzaro is said to\r\nhave commemorated his own mother. At this point the narrator is troubled\r\nby a dream portending death to the lady of his love. As, tormented by this\r\nthought, he wanders lonely in the chill dawn he meets a nymph, who leads\r\nhim through a marvellous cavern into the depths of the earth, where he\r\nbeholds the springs of many famous rivers, and finally, following the\r\ncourse of the Sabeto, arrives at his native city of Naples, where he\r\nlearns the truth of his sorrowful forebodings.\r\n\r\nThe form has been systematized since Boccaccio wrote, the whole being\r\ndivided into twelve _Prose_, alternating with as many _Ecloghe_, preceded\r\nby a _Proemio_ and followed by an address _Alla sampogna_, both in prose.\r\nThe verse is mediocre, and several of the eclogues are composed in the\r\nunattractive _sestina_ form, while others affect the wearisome _rime\r\nsdrucciole_.[58] The most pleasing is Ergasto's lament at Androgeo's tomb,\r\nbeginning:\r\n\r\n    Alma beata e bella,\r\n      Che da' legami sciolta\r\n      Nuda salisti ne' superni chiostri,\r\n      Ove con la tua stella\r\n      Ti godi insieme accolta;\r\n      E lieta ivi schernendo i pensier' nostri,\r\n      Quasi un bel sol ti mostri\r\n      Tra li più chiari spirti;\r\n      E coi vestigi santi\r\n      Calchi le stelle erranti;\r\n      E tra pure fontane e sacri mirti\r\n      Pasci celesti greggi;\r\n      E i tuoi cari pastori indi correggi. (_Ecloga_ V.)\r\n\r\nOne would hardly turn to the artificiality of the _Arcadia_ for\r\nrepresentations of nature, and yet there is in the romance a genuine love\r\nof the woods and the fields, and of the rustic sports of the season.\r\n'Sogliono il più delle volte gli alti e spaziosi alberi negli orridi monti\r\ndalla natura prodotti, più che le coltivate piante, da dotte mani\r\nespurgate negli adorni giardini, a' riguardanti aggradare,' remarks\r\nSannazzaro at the outset. Elsewhere he furnishes us with an entertaining\r\ndescription of the various ways in which birds may be trapped, introduced\r\npossibly in pursuance of a hint from Longus.[59] Yet, in spite of his\r\nprofessed love of savage scenery and his knowledge of pastoral sports, it\r\nis after all in a very artificial and straitened form that nature filters\r\nto us through Sannazzaro's pages. Rather do we turn to them for the sake\r\nof the paintings on the temple walls, of Amaranta's lips, 'fresh as the\r\nmorning rose,' of her wild lapful of flowers, and of a hundred other\r\nincidental pictures, one of the most charming of which, interesting on\r\nanother score also, I make no apology for here transcribing.\r\n\r\n  Subito ordinò i premi a coloro, che lottare volessero, offrendo di dare\r\n  al vincitore un bel vaso di legno di acero, ove per mano del Padoano\r\n  Mantegna, artefice sovra tutti gli altri accorto ed ingegnosissimo, eran\r\n  dipinte molte cose: ma tra l' altre una ninfa ignuda, con tutti i membri\r\n  bellissimi, dai piedi in fuori, che erano come quelli delle capre; la\r\n  quale, sovra un gonfiato otre sedendo, lattava un picciolo satirello, e\r\n  con tanta tenerezza il mirava, che parea che di amore e di carità tutta\r\n  si struggesse: e 'l fanciullo nell' una mammella poppava, nell' altra\r\n  tenea distesa la tenera mano, e con l' occhio la si guardava, quasi\r\n  temendo che tolta non gli fosse. Poco discosto da costoro si vedean due\r\n  fanciulli pur nudi, i quali avendosi posti due volti orribili di\r\n  maschere cacciavano per le bocche di quelli le picciole mani, per porre\r\n  spavento a duo altri, che davanti loro stavano; de' quali l' uno\r\n  fuggendo si volgea in dietro, e per paura gridava; l' altro caduto già\r\n  in terra piangeva, e non possendosi altrimenti aitare, stendeva la mano\r\n  per graffiarlo. (_Prosa_ XI.)\r\n\r\nI shall make no attempt at translation. Some versions, really wonderful\r\nin the success with which they reproduce the style of the original, will\r\nbe found in Symonds' _Italian Literature_[60]. It is probably unnecessary\r\nto put in a warning that the _Arcadia_ is a work of which extracts are apt\r\nto give a somewhat too favourable impression. In its long complaints,\r\nspeeches, and descriptions it is at whiles intolerably prolix and dull,\r\nbut it caught the taste of the age and went through a large number of\r\neditions, many with learned annotations, between the appearance of the\r\nfirst authorized edition and the end of the sixteenth century[61], There\r\nwere several imitations later, such as the _Accademia tusculana_ of\r\nBenedetto Menzini; Firenzuola imitated the third _Prosa_ in his\r\n_Sacrifizio pastorale_; while collections of tales and _facetiae_ such as\r\nthe _Arcadia in Brenta_ of Giovanni Sagredo equally sought the prestige of\r\nthe name. A French translation published in 1544 went through three\r\neditions, and another appeared in 1737, while it was translated into\r\nSpanish in 1547, and again in 1578. It may have been due to the existence\r\nof Sidney's more ambitious work of the same name that no translation ever\r\nappeared in English.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur survey of Italian pastoralism, in spite of the fact that its most\r\nimportant manifestation has been reserved for separate treatment later,\r\nhas of necessity been lengthy. It was at Italian breasts that the infant\r\nideal, reborn into a tumultuous world, was nursed. The other countries of\r\ncontinental Europe borrowed that ideal from Italy, though each in turn\r\ncontributed characteristics of its own. It was to Italy that England too\r\nwas directly indebted, while at the same time it absorbed elements\r\npeculiar to France and Spain. It will therefore be necessary briefly to\r\nreview the forms that flourished in those countries respectively, though\r\nthey need detain us but a brief space in comparison with the Italian\r\nfountain-head.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding, however, it may be worth while to pause for a moment in\r\norder to take a general survey of the nature of the ideal, we might almost\r\nsay the religion, of pastoralism, which reached its maturity in the work\r\nof Sannazzaro. Its location in the uplands of Arcadia may be traced to\r\nVergil, who had the worship of Pan in mind, but the selection of the\r\nbarren mountain district of central Peloponnesus as the seat of pastoral\r\nluxuriance and primitive culture is not without significance in respect of\r\nthe severance of the pastoral ideal from actuality.[62] In it the\r\nworld-weary age of the later renaissance sought escape from the\r\nmaterialism that bound it. Italy had turned its back upon mysticism in\r\nreligion, and upon chivalry in love; its literature was the negation of\r\nwhat the northern peoples understand by romance. Yet it needed some relief\r\nfrom the very saneness of its rationalism, and it found the antidote to\r\nits vicious court life in the crystal springs of Castaly. What the pietism\r\nof Perugino's saints is to the feuds of the Baglioni, such is the Arcadian\r\ndream to the intellectual cynicism of Italian politics.\r\n\r\nWhen children weave fancies of wonderland they use the resources of the\r\nimagination with economy; uninterrupted sunshine soon cloys. So too with\r\nthese other children of the renaissance. Their wonderland is a place\r\nwhither they may escape from the pressure of the world that is too much\r\nwith them; they seek in it at least the virtue that its evils shall be the\r\nopposite of those from which they fly. They could not, it is true, believe\r\nin an Arcadia in which all the cares of this world should end--the golden\r\nage is always a time to be sung and remembered, or else to be dreamed of,\r\nin the years to come, it is never the present--but if they cannot escape\r\nfrom the changes and chances of this mortal life, if death and unfaith\r\nare still realities in their dreamland as on earth, they will at least\r\nutter their grief melodiously, and water fair pastures with their tears.\r\nLike the garden of the Rose which satisfied the middle age before it, the\r\nArcadian ideal of the renaissance degenerated, as every ideal must. The\r\ndecay of pastoral, however, was in this unique, that it tended less to\r\nexaggerate than to negative the spirit that gave it birth. Theocritus\r\nturned from polite society and sought solace in his no doubt idealized\r\nrecollections of actual shepherd life. On the other hand, to the\r\nallegorical pastoralists from Vergil to Spagnuoli, the shepherd-realm\r\neither reflects, or is made directly to contrast with, the interests and\r\nvices of the actual world; in their work the note of longing for escape to\r\nan ideal life is heard but faintly or not at all. In the songs of the late\r\nfifteenth century and in Sannazzaro there is a genuine pastoral revival;\r\nthe desire of freedom from reality is strong upon men in that age of\r\nstrenuous living. It has been happily said that Mantuan's shepherds meet\r\nto discuss society, Sannazzaro's to forget it. And yet, after all, these\r\nmen are too strongly bound by the affections of this world to be able\r\nwholly to sacrifice themselves to the joys of the ideal. Fiammetta must\r\nhave her place in Boccaccio's strange apotheosis of love; the foreboding\r\nof Carmosina's death has power to draw her lover from his newly discovered\r\nkingdom along the untrodden paths of the waters of the earth. And so when\r\nArcadia ceased to be a necessity of sentiment and became one of fashion,\r\nwhere poets were no longer content to wander with their mistresses in the\r\nland of fancy, alone, 'at rest from their labour with the world gone by,'\r\nthere appeared a tendency to return to the allegorical style, and to make\r\nArcadia what Sicily had already become--the mirror of the polite society\r\nof the Italian courts. Thus it is that in the crowning jewels of Italian\r\npastoralism, in the _Aminta_ and the _Pastor fido_, we trace a yearning\r\ntowards a simpler, freer, and more genuine life, side by side with such\r\nincompatible and antagonistic elements as the reproduction in pastoral\r\nguise of the personages and surroundings of the circle of Ferrara. Not\r\ncontent with the pure ideal, the poets endeavoured, like Faust at the\r\nsight of Helena, to find in it a place for the earthly affections that\r\nbound them, and at the touch of reality the vision dissolved in mist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the literature of the western peninsula during the early\r\nyears of the sixteenth century, we find it characterized by a temporary\r\nbut very complete subjection to Italian models. This phenomenon, which is\r\nparticularly marked in pastoral, is readily explained by the fact that the\r\nsimilarity of the dialects made the transference of poetic forms from\r\nItalian to Spanish an easy matter. Thus when among the nations of Europe\r\nItaly awoke to her great task of recovering an old and discovering a new\r\nworld of arts and letters, it was upon Spanish verse that she was able to\r\nexercise the most immediate and overpowering influence. Under these\r\ncircumstances it was impossible but that she should drag the literature of\r\nthat country, for a while at least, in her train, away from its own proper\r\ngenius and natural course of development. Other countries were saved from\r\nservitude by the very failure of their attempts to imitate the new Italian\r\nstyle; and Spain herself, it must be remembered, was not long in\r\nrecovering her individuality and in endowing Europe with one of the\r\nrichest national literatures of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is important, however, to distinguish from the pastoral work produced\r\nunder this dominating Italian influence certain other work in the kind,\r\nwhich, while to some extent dependent for its form upon foreign models,\r\nbears at the same time strong marks of native inspiration. In this earlier\r\nand more popular tradition the tendencies of the national literature, the\r\npastoral possibilites of which appear at times in the ballads, mingle more\r\nor less with elements of convention and allegory drawn from Vergil or his\r\nhumanistic followers. Little influence of this popular tradition can as a\r\nrule be traced in the later pastoral work, but it acquires a certain\r\nincidental interest in connexion with another branch of literature. It is,\r\nnamely, the remarkable part it played in the evolution of the national\r\ndrama that makes it worth while mentioning a few of its more important\r\nexamples in this place.[63]\r\n\r\nAn isolated composition, in which lay not so much the germ of the future\r\ndrama as the index of its possibility, is the _Coplas de Mingo Revulgo_,\r\nthe composition of an unknown author. It is an eclogue in which two\r\nshepherds, representing respectively the upper and lower orders of Spanish\r\nsociety, discourse together on the causes of national discontent and\r\npolitical corruption prevalent about 1472, at the latter end of the weak\r\nreign of Enrique IV. In this poem we find the king's infatuation for his\r\nPortuguese mistress treated much as Petrarch had treated the relations of\r\nClement VI with the allegorical Epi, except for the striking difference\r\nthat the Latin of the Italian poet is replaced by straightforward and\r\nvigorous vernacular. Of far greater importance in the history of\r\nliterature are certain poems--_Éclogas_ they are for the most part\r\nstyled--of Juan del Encina, which belong roughly to the closing years of\r\nthe fifteenth and opening years of the sixteenth century. Numbering about\r\na dozen, and composed with one exception in the short measures of popular\r\npoetry, these dramatic eclogues, or amoebean plays, supply the connecting\r\nlink between the early popular and religious shows and the regular drama.\r\nAbout half are religious in character; of the rest, three treat some\r\nromantic episode, one is a study of unrequited passion ending in suicide,\r\nand one is a market-day farce, the personae being in each case rude\r\nherdsmen. Contemporary with, though a disciple of, Encina, is the\r\nPortuguese Gil Vicente, who wrote in both dialects, and whose _Auto\r\npastoril castelhano_ may be cited as carrying on the tradition between his\r\nmaster and Lope de Vega.\r\n\r\nWith Lope's dramatic production as a whole we are not, of course,\r\nconcerned. He lies indeed somewhat off our track; the pastoral influence\r\nin his work is capricious. It will be sufficient to note that the\r\ninfluence, where it exists, is external; it is nowhere the outcome of\r\nChristian allegory, nor does it arise out of the nature of the subject as\r\nsuch titles as the _Pastores de Belén_ might suggest. It is found equally\r\nin the religious or quasi-religious plays--such as the _Vuelta de Egypto_\r\nwith its shepherds and gypsies, and the _Pastor lobo_, an allegorical\r\nsatire on the church Lope afterwards entered--and in such purely secular,\r\namorous, and on the whole less dramatic pieces as the _Arcadia_--not to be\r\nconfused with his romance of the same name--and the _Selva sin amor_, a\r\nregular Italian pastoral in miniature, both of which were acted, besides\r\nmany others intended primarly for reading, though they may possibly have\r\nbeen recited after the manner of Castiglione's _Tirsi_.\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of the drama I may mention translations of the\r\n_Aminta_ and _Pastor fido_. Tasso's piece was rendered into Castilian by\r\nJuan de Jauregui, and first printed at Rome in 1607, a revised edition\r\nappearing among the author's poems in 1618. The _Pastor fido_ was\r\ntranslated by Cristóbal Suárez de Figueroa, the best version being that\r\nprinted at Valentia in 1609, from which Ticknor quotes a passage as\r\ntypical as it is successful. It was to these two versions of the\r\nmasterpieces of Italian pastoral that Cervantes accorded the highest meed\r\nof praise, declaring that 'they haply leave it doubtful which is the\r\ntranslation or original.'[64] There likewise exists a poor adaptation of\r\nGuarini's play, said to be the work of Solis, Coello, and Calderon[65].\r\nThe pastoral appears, however, never to have gained a very firm footing\r\nupon the mature Spanish stage, no doubt for the same reason that led to a\r\nsimilar result in England, namely, that the vigorous national drama about\r\nit overpowered and choked its delicate and exotic growth[66].\r\n\r\nApart from the dramatic or semi-dramatic work we have been reviewing, the\r\npastoral verse which possesses the most natural and national character,\r\nthough it may not be the earliest in date, is to be found in the poems of\r\nFrancisco de Sâ de Miranda[67]. He appears to have begun writing\r\nindependently of the Italian school, and, even after he came under the\r\ninfluence of Garcilaso, to have preserved much of his natural simplicity\r\nand genuineness of feeling. He probably had some direct knowledge of the\r\nItalians, for he writes:\r\n\r\n    Liamos....\r\n    .... os pastores italianos\r\n    Do bom velho Sanazarro.\r\n\r\nHe may also have been influenced by Encina, most of whose work had already\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nThe first and foremost of those who deliberately based their style on the\r\nItalian was Garcilaso de la Vega, whose pastoral work dates from about\r\n1526. To him, in conjunction with Boscán and Mendoza, the vogue was due.\r\nAt his best, when he really assimilates the foreign elements borrowed from\r\nhis models and makes their style his own, he writes with the true genius\r\nof his nation. The first of his three eclogues, which was probably\r\ncomposed at Naples and is regarded as his best work, introduces the\r\nshepherds Salico and Nemoroso, of whom the first stands for the author,\r\nwhile in the other it is not hard to recognize his friend Boscán. This\r\npoem, a portion of which is translated by Ticknor, should of itself\r\nsuffice to place Garcilaso in the front rank of pastoral writers. Yet he\r\ndoes not appear to occupy any isolated eminence among his fellows, and\r\nTicknor may be right in thinking that, throughout, the regular pastoral\r\nshowed fewer of its defects in Spain than elsewhere. It is also true that\r\nit appears to have been endowed with less vital power of development.\r\n\r\nGarcilaso's followers were numerous. Among them mention may be made of\r\nFrancisco de Figueroa, the Tirsi of Cervantes' _Galatea_; Pedro de\r\nEncinas, who attempted religious eclogues; Lope de Vega; Alonso de Ulloa,\r\nthe Venetian printer, who is credited with having foisted the Rodrigo\r\nepisode into Montemayor's _Diana_; Gaspar Gil Polo, one of the\r\ncontinuators of that work; and Bernardo de Balbuenas, one of its many\r\nimitators, who incorporated in his _Siglo de Oro_ a number of eclogues\r\nwhich in their simple and rustic nature appear to be studied from\r\nTheocritus rather than Vergil.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fashion of writing in Castilian which prevailed among\r\nPortuguese poets, we are not without specimens of pastoral verse composed\r\nin the less important dialect. Sâ de Miranda has been mentioned above.\r\nRibeiro too, better known for his romance, left a series of five\r\nautobiographical eclogues[68] dating from about 1516-24, and consequently\r\nearlier than Garcilaso's. They are composed, like some of Sâ de Miranda's,\r\nin the short measures more natural to the language than the _terza rima_\r\nand intricate stanzas of the Italianizing poets. Later on Camoens wrote\r\nfifteen eclogues, four of which are piscatorial, and in one, a dialogue\r\nbetween a shepherd and a fisherman, refers in the following terms to\r\nSannazzaro:\r\n\r\n      O pescador Sincero, que amansado\r\n    Tém o pégo de Prochyta co' o canto\r\n    Por as sonoras ondas compassado.\r\n      D'este seguindo o som, que póde tanto,\r\n    E misturando o antigo Mantuano,\r\n    Façamos novo estylo, novo espanto.\r\n\r\nWhereas in the case of the verse pastoral the Italian fashion passed from\r\nSpain into Portugal, exactly the reverse process took place with regard to\r\nthe prose romance more or less directly founded upon Sannazzaro. The first\r\nto imitate the _Arcadia_ was the Portuguese Bernardim Ribeiro, who during\r\na two-years' residence in Italy composed the 'beautiful fragment,' as\r\nTicknor styles it, entitled from the first words of the text _Menina e\r\nmoça_. This unfinished romance first appeared, in the form of an octavo\r\ncharmingly printed in gothic type, at Ferrara in 1554, though it must\r\nhave been written at least thirty years earlier. It differs considerably\r\nfrom its model, the verse being purely incidental, and the intricacy of\r\nthe story anticipating later examples, as does likewise the admixture of\r\nchivalric adventure. It is, indeed, to a large extent what might have\r\narisen spontaneously through the elaboration of the pastoral element\r\noccasionally to be met with in the old chivalric romances themselves. On\r\nthe other hand it resembles the Italian pastoral in the introduction of\r\nreal characters, which, though their identity was concealed under anagrams\r\nand all manner of obscurity, appear to have been traceable by the keen eye\r\nof authority, for the book was placed on the Index. Such knowledge of\r\nSannazzaro's writings as Ribeiro possessed was of course direct, but\r\nbefore his fragment saw the light there appeared, in 1547, a Spanish\r\ntranslation of the _Arcadia_. It must be remembered that Sannazzaro was\r\nhimself of Spanish extraction, and that he may have had relations with the\r\nland of his fathers of a nature to facilitate the diffusion of his works.\r\n\r\nThe next and by far the most important contribution made by the peninsula\r\nto pastoral literature was the work of an hispaniolized Portuguese, who\r\ncomposed in Castilian dialect the famous _Diana_. 'Los siete libres de la\r\nDiana de Jorge de Montemayor'--the Spanish form of Montemôr's name and\r\nthat by which he became familiar to subsequent ages--appeared at Valencia,\r\nwithout date, but about 1560.[69] As in the case of its Italian and\r\nPortuguese predecessors, some at least of the characters of the romance\r\nrepresent real persons. Sireno the hero, who stands for the author, is in\r\nlove with the nymph Diana, of whose identity Lope de Vega claimed to be\r\ncognizant, though he withheld her name. The scene is laid in Spain, and\r\nactual and ideal geography are intermixed in a bewildering fashion. Sireno\r\nis obliged, for reasons not stated, to leave the country for a while, and\r\non his return finds his lady-love married by her parents to his rival\r\nDelio. In his despair he seeks aid from the priestess of a certain temple,\r\nand receives from her a magic potion which drives from him all remembrance\r\nof his passion. This very simple and somewhat unsatisfactory story is\r\ninterwoven with a multitude of episodes and incidental narratives,\r\npastoral and chivalric, and the whole ends with the promise of a second\r\npart, which however never came to be written, the author, as it appears,\r\nbeing either murdered or killed in duel at Turin in 1561.\r\n\r\nThanks probably to the combination in its pages of the popular chivalric\r\ntradition with the fashionable Italian pastoral, and also to certain\r\ngraces of style which it possesses, the _Diana_ held the field until the\r\npicaresque romance developed into a recognized _genre_, and exercised a\r\nvery considerable influence on pastoral writers even beyond the frontiers\r\nof Spain. Googe imitated passages from it in his eclogues; Sidney\r\ntranslated some of its songs, and took it as the model of his own romance;\r\nShakespeare borrowed from it the plot of the _Two Gentlemen of Verona_. In\r\nthe land of its birth its popularity was shown by the number of\r\ncontinuations and imitations to which it gave rise. Irresponsible\r\npublishers swelled the bulk of their editions with matter purloined from\r\nless popular authors. The year 1564 saw the appearance of two second\r\nparts. One in eight books, by the physician Alonzo Pérez, only got so far\r\nas disposing of Delio, and appears to exaggerate all the faults of the\r\noriginal in compensation for the lack of its merits. The other, from the\r\npen of Gaspar Gil Polo, is in five books, and narrates, in a style\r\nscarcely inferior to its model, the faithlessness and death of Delio, and\r\nSireno's marriage with Diana. Both alike promise continuations which never\r\nappeared. A third part was, however, published so late as 1627, as the\r\nwork of Jerónimo de Texeda, but it is nothing more than a _rifacimento_\r\nof Gil Polo's continuation, altered apparently with a view to its forming\r\na sequel to Pérez' work. Furthermore, in 1599 there appeared a religions\r\nparody by Fra Bartolomé Ponce, and there are said to be no less than six\r\nFrench, two English, and two German translations, not to mention a Latin\r\none of Gil Polo's portion at least.\r\n\r\nBesides continuations, there are extant nearly a score of imitations of\r\nvarying interest and merit. In 1584 appeared the _Galatea_ of Cervantes,\r\nimitated from Ribeiro and Montemayor; which in its turn is supposed to\r\nhave suggested the _Arcadia_, written a few years later at the instigation\r\nof the Duke of Alva by Lope de Vega, and published in 1598. Each is more\r\nor less autobiographic or else historical in outline: 'many of its\r\nshepherds and shepherdesses are such in dress alone,' Cervantes confesses\r\nof his romance, while Lope announces that 'the _Arcadia_ is a true\r\nhistory.' Lastly may be mentioned the Portuguese _Primavera_ of Francisco\r\nRodrígues de Lobo, which appeared in three long parts between 1601 and\r\n1614, and is pronounced by Ticknor to be 'among the best full-length\r\npastoral romances extant.'\r\n\r\nAll these works resemble one another in their general features. The\r\ncharacteristics of the _genre_ as found in Spain, in spite of a real\r\nfeeling for rural life traceable in the national character, are the\r\nelements it borrows from the older chivalric tradition, combined with an\r\nadherence to the circumstances of actual existence even closer than was\r\nthe case in Italy. Sannazzaro was content to transfer certain personages\r\nfrom real life into his imaginary Arcadia, while in the Spanish romances\r\nthe whole _mise en scène_ consists of the actual surroundings of the\r\nauthor disguised but little under the veil of pastoralism. Thus the ideal\r\nelement, the desire to escape from the world, is no less absent from these\r\nworks than from the Latin eclogues of the renaissance, and the chivalric\r\npastoral in Spain advances far along the road towards the fashionable\r\npastoral of France. Not only are knightly adventures freely introduced,\r\nand the devices of disguise and recognition employed, but the hint of\r\nmagic in Sannazzaro is developed and made to play a prominent part in the\r\ntales, while the nymphs and shepherds display throughout an alarming\r\nknowledge of literature, metaphysics, and theology. The absurdities of the\r\nstyle were patent, and did not escape uncomplimentary notice from the\r\nwriters of the day, for both Cervantes and Lope de Vega, in spite of their\r\nown excursions into this kind, pilloried the fashion in their more serious\r\nand enduring works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn France the interest of pastoralism, from our present point of view, is\r\nsummed up in the work of one man--Clément Marot. It is he who forms the\r\ncentral figure on the stage of French poetry between the final collapse of\r\nthe medieval tradition and the ceasing of Villon's song earlier, and later\r\nthe full burst of the renaissance in the work of the Pléiade. While\r\nbelonging ostensibly to the literary circle of Margaret of Navarre, Marot\r\nappears to have combined in his own person a strange number of conflicting\r\ntendencies. His patroness followed the pastoral tradition in her imitation\r\nof Sannazzaro's _Salices_ and her lament on the death of her brother\r\nFrançois I, and rehandled an already favourite theme in her _comédie_ of\r\nhuman and divine love. Marot, on the other hand, while equally interested\r\nin pastoral, betrayed in his verse little direct influence of the\r\nItalians, and invariably impressed his own individuality upon his subject.\r\nIn his early work he continued the tradition of the _Romance of the Rose_;\r\nlater he voiced, somewhat crudely may be, the ideals of the renaissance.\r\nBy nature an easy-going _bon vivant_, his only real affection appears to\r\nhave been for the faithless mistress of his early years, whom a not very\r\nprobable tradition identifies with Diane de Poitiers. He had no higher\r\nambition than to retain unmolested a comfortable post at the court of\r\nFrancis. Yet he was destined by a strange irony of fate to pass his days\r\nas a wanderer on the face of the earth, the homeless pilgrim of a cause he\r\nno wise had at heart. He was accused by the Sorbonne, and ultimately\r\ndriven into the profession, of the heresy of Calvinism. Expelled from the\r\nbosom of the church, he sought an uncongenial refuge among the apostles of\r\nthe new faith, only to be thrust forth from the city, for no more heinous\r\noffence apparently than that playing back-gammon with the Prisoner of\r\nChillon. He died at Turin in 1544.\r\n\r\nBut, however fascinating Marot may be as an historical figure, he was in\r\nno sense a great poet. His chief merit in literature, apart from his often\r\ndelicate epigrams, his _élégant badinage_ and his graceful if at times\r\nfacile verse, lies in the power he possesses, in common with Garcilaso and\r\nSpenser, of treating the allegorical pastoral without entirely losing the\r\ncharm of naïve simplicity and genuine feeling. In his _Éclogue au Roi_ he\r\naddresses Francis under the name of Pan, while in the _Pastoureau\r\nchrestien_ he applies the same name to the Deity; yet in either case there\r\nis a justness of sentiment underlying the convention which saves the verse\r\nfrom degenerating into mere sycophancy or blasphemy. His chief claim to\r\nnotice as a pastoral writer is his authorship of an eclogue on the death\r\nof Loyse de Savoye, the mother of Francis; a poem through which, more than\r\nany other, he influenced his greater English disciple, and thereby\r\nacquired the importance he possesses for our present inquiry.\r\n\r\nMarot, however, whose inspiration, in so far as it was not born of his own\r\ngenius, appears to be chiefly derived from Vergil, whose first eclogue he\r\ntranslated in his youth, was far from being the only poet who wrote\r\nbucolic verse or bore other witness to pastoral influence. France was not\r\nbehind other nations in embracing the Italian models. Margaret, as I have\r\nsaid, imitated Sannazzaro in her _Histoire des satyres et nymphes de\r\nDiane_. The _Arcadia_ was translated in 1544. Du Bellay was familiar with\r\nthe original and honoured its author with imitation, translation, and even\r\na respectful mention of it in his famous _Défense_. Elsewhere he asks:\r\n\r\n    Qui fera taire la musette\r\n    Du pasteur néapolitain?\r\n\r\nThe first part of Belleau's _Bergerie_ appeared in 1565, the complete\r\nwork, including a piscatory poem, in 1572. On the stage Nicolas Filleul\r\nanticipated the regular Italian drama in a dramatized eclogue entitled\r\n_Les Ombres_ in 1566. Later Nicolas de Montreux, better known under the\r\nname of Ollenix du Mont-Sacré, a writer of a religious cast, and author\r\nof a romantic comedy on the story of Potiphar's wife, composed three\r\npastoral plays, _Athlette_, _Diane_, and _Arimène_, which appeared in\r\n1585, 1592, and 1597 respectively. They are conventional pastorals on the\r\nItalian model, futile in plot and commonplace in style. He was also the\r\nauthor of the _Bergerie de Juliette_, a romance published in 1592, which\r\nRobert Tofte is credited with having translated in his _Honour's\r\nAcademy_,' or the Famous Pastoral of the Fair Shepherdess Julietta,' which\r\nappeared at London in 1610. Tofte's work, however, while purporting to be\r\n'done into English,' makes no mention of the original author, and though\r\nindebted for its form and title to Nicholas' romance does not appear to\r\nbear much further resemblance to it. A far more important work in itself,\r\nbut one which does not much concern us here, is Honoré d'Urfé's _Astrée_,\r\nan autobiographic compilation in which the fashionable pastoral romance\r\nfound its most consummate example. The work was translated into English as\r\nearly as 1620, but the history of its influence in this country belongs\r\nalmost exclusively to the French vogue, which began about the middle of\r\nthe century, and formed such an important element in the literature of the\r\nrestoration.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively small influence exerted by the French pastoral of the\r\nrenaissance on that of England must excuse the scanty summary given in the\r\npreceding paragraphs. It remains to be said that there had existed at an\r\nearlier period in France another and very different tradition, which\r\nsupplied one of the regular forms of composition in vogue among\r\n_trouvères_ and _troubadours_ alike. The _pastourelle_ has sometimes been\r\ndescribed as a popular form, but it would be difficult to determine\r\nwherein its 'popularity,' in the sense intended, consists, for it is\r\neasily recognized as the offspring of a knightly minstrelsy, and indeed is\r\nscarcely less artificial or conventional than the Italian eclogue.\r\nAlthough the situation is frequently developed with resource and invention\r\non the part of the individual poet, the general type is rigidly fixed. The\r\nnarrator, who is a minstrel and usually a knight, while riding along meets\r\na shepherd-girl, to whom he pays his court with varying success. This is\r\nthe simple framework on which the majority are composed. A few, on the\r\nother hand, depart from the type and depict purely rustic scenes.\r\nOthers--and the fact is at least significant--serve to convey allusions,\r\npolitical, personal or didactic: a variety found as early as the twelfth\r\ncentury in Provençal, and about the fourteenth in northern French.\r\nWandering scholars adopted the form from the knightly singers and produced\r\na plentiful crop of Latin _pastoralia_, usually of a somewhat burlesque\r\nnature. An idea of the general style of these may be gathered from such\r\nlines as the following, which contain the reply of a country girl\r\nhesitating before the advances of a merry student:\r\n\r\n    Si senserit meus pater\r\n    uel Martinus maior frater,\r\n    erit mihi dies ater;\r\n    uel si sciret mea mater,\r\n    cum sit angue peior quater:\r\n    uirgis sum tributa.[70]\r\n\r\nAppropriated, lastly, and refashioned by the hand of an original genius,\r\nthe _pastourelle_ gave to German poetry the crowning jewel of its\r\n_Minnesang_ in Walther's 'Under der linden,' with its irrepressibly\r\nroguish refrain:\r\n\r\n    Kuster mich? wol tûsentstunt:\r\n    tandaradei,\r\n    seht wie rôt mir ist der munt!\r\n\r\nConnected with the _pastourelles_ of the _langue d'oïl_ is an isolated\r\ndramatic effort, of a primitive and naïve sort, but of singular grace and\r\ncharm. _Li jus Robins et Marion_, the work of Adan le Bochu or de le Hale,\r\nis in fact a dramatized _pastourelle_ of some eight hundred lines\r\nbeginning with the rejection by a shepherdess of the advances of a knight\r\nand ending with the rustic sports of the shepherds on the green.\r\nUnsophisticated nature and playful cunning unite in no ordinary degree to\r\nlend delicacy and savour to the work, while the literary quality of Adan's\r\nverse is evident in such incidental songs as Marion's often quoted:\r\n\r\n    Robins m'aime, Robins m'a,\r\n    Robins m'a demandee, si m'ara.\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of the genuine _naïveté_ and natural realism of the\r\npiece, it is easy to recognize in it something of the same spirit of\r\ngentle raillery that sparkles in the graceful octaves of Lorenzo's\r\n_Nencia_.\r\n\r\nA real and lively love of the country, rather than any idealization of the\r\nactual shepherd class, is reflected in a poem written about 1460 by René\r\nof Anjou, ex-king of Naples, describing in pastoral guise the rustic\r\nretreat which he enjoyed in company with his wife, Jeanne de Laval, on the\r\nbanks of the Durance. The conventional pastoralism that veils the identity\r\nof the shepherd and shepherdess is scarcely more than a pretence, for at\r\nthe end of the manuscript we find blazoned the arms of the royal pair,\r\nwith the inscription:\r\n\r\n    Icy sont les armes, dessoubz ceste couronne,\r\n    Du bergier dessus dit et de la bergeronne.\r\n\r\nWe have now completed the first section of our introductory survey of\r\npastoral literature. We have passed in review, in a necessarily rapid and\r\nsuperficial, but, it is to be hoped, not altogether inadequate, manner,\r\nthe varions manifestations of the kind in the non-dramatic literature of\r\ncontinental Europe. The Italian pastoral drama has been reserved for\r\nseparate and more detailed consideration in close connexion with that of\r\nthis country. It must, however, be borne in mind that in such a survey as\r\nthe present many of the byways and more or less obscure and devious\r\nchannels by which pastoral permeated the wide fields of literature have of\r\nnecessity been left unexplored. Nothing, for instance, has been said about\r\nthe pastoral interludes which occupy a not inconspicuous place in the\r\nmartial cantos both of the _Orlando_ and the _Gerusalemme_. Before passing\r\non, however, I should like to say a few words concerning one particular\r\ndepartment of renaissance literature, and that chiefly by way of\r\nillustrating the limitations of the tradition of literary pastoral. I\r\nrefer to the _novelle_ or _nouvelles_, in which, although pastoral\r\nsubjects are occasionally introduced, the treatment is entirely\r\nindependent of conventional tradition. Without making any pretence at\r\ncovering the whole field of the _novellieri_, I may instance a tale of\r\nGiraldi's, not lacking in the homely charm which belongs to that author,\r\nof a child exposed in a wood and brought up by the shepherds. These are\r\nrepresented as simple unpretending Lombard peasants, who look to their own\r\nbusiness and are credited with none of the arts and graces of their\r\nliterary fellows. More exclusively rustic in setting is an anecdote\r\nconcerning the amours of a shepherd and shepherdess, told with broad\r\nhumour in the _Cent Nouvelles nouvelles_ and elaborated with\r\ncharacteristic gusto and extraordinarily graphic art by Pietro Fortini.\r\nThe crude obscenity of the subject alone serves to show how free the\r\nwriter was from any influence of the pastoral of polite literature.[71]\r\nNumerous other stories concerning shepherds or _villani_ might be cited,\r\nfrom Boccaccio to Bandello, the point of which, whether openly licentious\r\nor ostensibly moral, is brought home with a brutal and physical directness\r\nutterly foreign to the spirit of the regular pastoral. This is, on the\r\nwhole, what one would expect. The coarse realism that gave life and\r\nvitality to the novel, that characteristic product of middle-class\r\ncynicism and humour, finds no place in the pastoral of literary tradition.\r\nThe conventional grace of the pastoral could offer no material to the\r\nnovel. It is true that when we speak of the _bourgeois_ spirit of the\r\n_novella_ on the one hand, and the 'ideal' pastoral on the other, it is\r\nwell to remember that the author of the _Decameron_ also wrote the first\r\nmodern pastoral romance; that the century and country which saw the\r\npublication of the _Arcadia_, the _Aminta_, and the _Pastor fido_, also\r\nwelcomed the work of Fortini, Giraldi, and Bandello; and that to Margaret\r\nof Navarre, the imitator of Sannazzaro and patroness of Marot, we are\r\nlikewise indebted for the _Heptameron_. Nevertheless the tendencies,\r\nthough sometimes united in the person of a single author, yet keep\r\ndistinct. Both alike had become a fashion, both alike followed a more or\r\nless conventional type. The novel remained coarse and realistic; the\r\npastoral, whatever may be said of its morality, remained refined and at a\r\nconscious remove from real life. To examine thoroughly the cause of this\r\ndisseverance from actuality which haunted the pastoral throughout its many\r\ntransformations would lead us beyond all possible bounds of this inquiry.\r\nOne important point may, however, here be noted. The pastoral, whatever\r\nits form, always needed and assumed some external circumstance to give\r\npoint to its actual content. The interest seldom arises directly from the\r\nnarrative itself. In Theocritus and Sannazzaro this objective point is\r\nsupplied by the delight of escape from the over-civilization of the city;\r\nin Petrarch and Mantuan, by their allegorical intention; in Sacchetti and\r\nLorenzo, by the contrast of town and country, with all its delicate\r\nhumour; in Boccaccio and Poliziano, by the opening it gave for golden\r\ndreams of exquisite beauty or sensuous delight; in Tasso, by the desire of\r\nthat freedom in love and life which sentimental philosophers have always\r\nassociated with a return to nature. In all these cases the content _per\r\nse_ may be said to be matter of indifference; it only receives meaning in\r\nrelation to some ulterior intention of the author. Realism under these\r\ncircumstances was impossible. Nor could satire call it forth, for no one\r\nwould be at pains to satirize actual rusticity. The only loophole left by\r\nwhich a realistic treatment could find its way into pastoral was when, as\r\nin Folengo's macaronics, it was not the actual rustic life but the\r\nconventional representation of it that was the object of satire. But this\r\ncase was naturally a rare one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\n\r\nPastoral Poetry in England\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen how there arose in the Italian songs of the fourteenth\r\ncentury a spontaneous form of pastoral independent of the regular\r\ntradition, and somewhat similar examples are furnished by the dramatic\r\neclogues of Spain. In the former case, however, pastoral was never more\r\nthan a passing note; while in the latter, the impulse, though possessing\r\nsome vitality, was early overwhelmed by the rising tide of Italian\r\ninfluence. In England it was otherwise. On the one hand the spontaneous\r\nand popular impulse towards a form of pastoralism appears to have been\r\nstronger and more consistent than elsewhere; on the other the foreign and\r\nliterary influence never acquired the same supreme importance. As a resuit\r\nthe earlier native fashion affected in a noticeable degree later pastoral\r\nwork, colouring and blending with instead of being overpowered by the\r\nregular tradition. Thus it is possible to trace two distinct though\r\nmutually reacting tendencies far down the stream of English literature,\r\nand to this double origin must be referred many of the peculiar phenomena\r\nof English pastoral work. There was furthermore a constant struggle for\r\nsupremacy between the two traditions, in which now one now the other\r\nappeared likely to go under. The greatest poets of their day, Spenser and\r\nMilton, threw the weight of their authority on to the side of pastoral\r\northodoxy. Spenser, however, was himself too much influenced by the\r\npopular impulse for his example to be decisive in favour of the regular\r\ntradition, while, by the time Milton wrote, a hybrid form had established\r\nitself on a more or less secure basis and a _modus vivendi_ had already\r\nbeen achieved. Meanwhile the bulk of pastofal poets affected a less\r\nweighty and more spontaneous song, whether they wrote in the light\r\nfanciful mood of Drayton or the more passionate and romantic spirit of\r\nBrowne.\r\n\r\nTo this double origin may be ascribed a certain noticeable vitality that\r\ncharacterizes English pastoral composition. Since this quality has been\r\nhabitually overlooked by literary historians, I may be excused for\r\ndwelling on it somewhat in this place. The stigma which, not altogether\r\nundeservedly, attaches to pastoral as a whole has tempted critics to\r\nconfine their attention to the more notable examples of the kind, and to\r\ntreat these as more or less sporadic manifestations. Thus they have\r\nfailed, on the whole, to appreciate the relation in which these works\r\nstand to the general pastoral tradition, which was mainly carried on in\r\nworks of little individual interest. It is no blame to them if they\r\nconsidered that these undistinguished productions were of small importance\r\nin the general history of literature: any one who goes through them with\r\ncare will probably arrive at a not very dissimilar conclusion.\r\nNevertheless the fact remains that the neglect of them has obscured both\r\nthe relative positions of the greater and more enduring works, and also\r\nthe general nature of the pastoral tradition in this country. That\r\ntradition I believe to have been of a far more noteworthy character than\r\nhas hitherto been realized. I am not, of course, prepared to maintain that\r\npastoral composition in England ever attained, as a whole, to the rank of\r\ngreat literature, or that it formed such a remarkable body of work as we\r\nfind, for example, in the Arcadian drama of Italy. But when we come to\r\nregard the pastoral production of this country in the light of a more or\r\nless connected tradition, it is impossible not be struck by the\r\noriginality and diversity of the various forms which it assumed. Though as\r\na literary kind it never rivalled its Italian model in fertility, it\r\nevinced an individual and versatile quality which we seek in vain in other\r\ncountries. To substantiate this claim and to show how far the vitality of\r\nthe English pastoral was due to its hybrid origin will be my chief aim in\r\nthis chapter. When I come to deal with the main subject of this inquiry it\r\nwill be necessary to determine how far similar considerations apply in the\r\ncase of the pastoral drama.\r\n\r\nIn the first place we have to consider what was produced on the one hand\r\nby the purely native impulse, and on the other under the sole inspiration\r\nof foreign tradition, at a period when these two influences had not yet\r\nbegun to interact. As an argument in favour of the spontaneous and genuine\r\nnature of the earlier fashion may be noticed its appearance in that\r\nmiscellaneous body of anonymous literature which, whatever may be its\r\norigin--and it is impossible to enter on so controversial a subject in\r\nthis place--is at least 'popular' in the sense of having been long handed\r\ndown from generation to generation in the mouths of the people. The\r\nacceptance of pastoral ballads into this great mass of traditional\r\nliterature is at least as good evidence of their popular character as that\r\nof authorship could be. In such a body of literature it would indeed be\r\nsurprising had the _pastourelle_ motive not found entrance; but it is\r\nnoteworthy that whereas the French and Latin poems are habitually written\r\nfrom the point of view of the lover, the English ballads adopt that of the\r\npeasant maiden to whom the high-born suitor pays his court. At once the\r\nsimplest and most poetical of the ballads on this model is that printed by\r\nScott as _The Broom of Cowdenknows_, a title to which in all probability\r\nit has little claim. It is a delightful example of the minor ballad\r\nliterature, and I am by no means inclined to regard it as a mere\r\namplification of the much shorter and rather abrupt _Bonny May_ of Herd's\r\ncollection, though the latter, so far as it goes, probably offers a less\r\nsophisticated text. In either case a gentleman riding along meets a girl\r\nmilking, obtains her love, and ultimately returns and marries her. A\r\nsimilar incident, in which, however, the seducer marries the girl under\r\ncompulsion and then discovers her to be of noble parentage, is told in a\r\nballad, of which a number of versions have been collected in Scotland\r\nunder the title of _Earl Richard_ or _Earl Lithgow_, and of which an\r\nEnglish version was current in the seventeenth century and was quoted more\r\nthan once by Beaumont and Fletcher.[72] This was printed by Percy in the\r\n_Reliques_, and two broadsides of it dating from the restoration are\r\npreserved in the Roxburghe collection. It is inferior to the northern\r\nversions, but both are probably late, and contain stanzas belonging to or\r\ncopied from other ballads, notably the _Bonny Hynd_ of the Herd manuscript\r\nand _Burd Helen_ (the Scotch version of _Child Waters_). The title of the\r\nbroadsides is interesting as betraying the influence of the regular\r\npastoral tradition: 'The beautifull Shepherdesse of Arcadia. A new\r\npastarell Song of a courteous young Knight, and a supposed Shepheards\r\nDaughter.'[73] Again, apparently from the Aberdeen district, comes a\r\nballad on the marriage of a shepherd's daughter to the Laird of Drum. On\r\nthe other hand we find three somewhat similar ballads, _Lizie Lindsay_ or\r\n_Donald of the Isles, Lizie Baillie_, and _Glasgow Peggie_, recording the\r\nelopement of a town girl with a highland gentleman in the disguise of a\r\nshepherd. These are obviously late, though a certain resemblance in style\r\nwith _Johnie Faa_ makes it possible that they are as old as the middle of\r\nthe seventeenth century. None of the pastoral ballads, indeed, can show\r\nany credentials which would suggest an earlier date than the second half\r\nof the sixteenth century, nor can any of them lay claim to first-rate\r\npoetic merit.[74]\r\n\r\nAnother example of native pastoral, earlier and far more genuine in\r\ncharacter, is to be found in the religious drama. The romantic\r\npossibilities of peasant life were to some extent reflected in the\r\nballads; it is the burlesque aspect that is preserved to us in the\r\n'shepherd' plays of the mystery cycles. We possess the plays on the\r\nadoration of the shepherds belonging to the four extant series, a\r\nduplicate in the Towneley plays, and one odd specimen, making six in all.\r\nThe rustic element varies in each case, but it assumed the form of\r\nburlesque comedy in all except the purely didactic 'Coventry' cycle of the\r\nCotton manuscript. Here, indeed, the treatment of the situation is\r\ndecorously dull, but in the others we can trace a gradual advance in\r\nhumorous treatment leading up to the genuine comedy of the alternative\r\nTowneley plays. Thus, like Noah and his wife, the shepherds of the\r\nadoration early became recognized comic characters, and there can be\r\nlittle doubt of the influence exercised by these scenes upon the later\r\ninterludes. With the general evolution of the drama we are of course in no\r\nwise here concerned: what it imports us to notice is that just as it was\r\nthe picture of the young gallant riding along on the mirk evening by the\r\nfail dyke of the 'bought i' the lirk o' the hill' that caught the\r\nimagination of the north-country milkmaids, so it was the rough\r\nrepresentation of rustic manners, with which they must have been familiar\r\nin actual life, that appealed to the villagers flocking to York,\r\nLeicester, Beverley, or Wakefield to witness the annual representation of\r\nthe guild cycle.[75]\r\n\r\nIt will be worth while to give some account of the form taken by this\r\ngenuine pastoral comedy, as we find it in its highest development in the\r\ntwo Towneley plays. These belong to the latest additions to the cycle, and\r\nwere probably first incorporated when the repertory underwent revision in\r\nthe early years of the fifteenth century.[76] Each play falls into three\r\nportions: first, a rustic farce; secondly, the apparition and announcement\r\nof the angels; and thirdly, the adoration. The two latter do not\r\nparticularly concern us. Though in the Chester cycle the shepherds show\r\nthemselves amusingly ignorant of the meaning of the _Gloria_, in the\r\nTowneley plays they are apt to fall out of character, and certainly\r\ndisplay a singular knowledge of the prophets,[77] for\r\n\r\n    Abacuc and ely prophesyde so,\r\n    Elezabeth and zachare and many other mo,\r\n    And david as veraly is witnes thereto,\r\n    Iohn Bapyste sewrly and daniel also.\r\n\r\nMore remarkable still is one shepherd's familiarity with the classics:\r\n\r\n    Virgill in his poetre sayde in his verse,\r\n    Even thus by gramere as I shall reherse;\r\n    'Iam nova progenies celo demittitur alto,\r\n    Iam rediet virgo, redeunt saturnia regna.'[78]\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps no matter for surprise that one of his less learned fellows\r\nshould break out with more force than delicacy:\r\n\r\n    Weme! tord! what speke ye here in myn eeres?\r\n    Tell us no clerge I hold you of the freres.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the little ironies of literature that in the earliest picture\r\nof pastoral life in England the greatest pastoral writer of Rome should be\r\nquoted, not as a pastoralist, but as a magician.\r\n\r\nBefore the appearance of the angels, however, there is nothing to lead one\r\nto expect this strange display of learning. A rougher, simpler set of\r\ncountrymen it would have been hard to find in the England of Chaucer and\r\nLangland. In the shepherd-play known as _prima pastorum_ the comic element\r\nconsists mostly in quarrels and feasting among the shepherds, but in the\r\n_secunda pastorum_ it constitutes a regular little three-scene farce,\r\nwhich at its date was absolutely unique in literature. It is thence only a\r\nstep, and a very short one, to John Heywood's interludes--though it is a\r\nstep that took more than a century to accomplish.\r\n\r\nThe first shepherd comes in complaining of the hard weather; his fingers\r\nare chapped, the storms blow from every quarter in turn. 'Sely shepardes,'\r\nmoreover, are put upon by any rich upstart and have no redress. A second\r\nshepherd appears with another grumble: 'We sely wedmen dre mekyll wo.'\r\nSome men, indeed, have been known to desire two wives or even three, but\r\nmost would sooner have none at all. Whereupon enters Daw, a third\r\nshepherd, complaining of portents 'With mervels mo and mo.' 'Was never syn\r\nnoe floode sich floodys seyn'; even 'I se shrewys pepe'--apparently a\r\nportentous omen. At this point Mak comes on the scene. He is a notorious\r\nbad character of the neighbourhood, who boasts himself 'a yoman, I tell\r\nyou, of the king,' and complains that his wife eats him out of house and\r\nhome. The shepherds suspect him of designs upon their flocks, so when they\r\nlie down to rest they place him the middle man of three. As soon, however,\r\nas the shepherds are asleep--'that may ye all here'--Mak borrows a sheep\r\nand makes off. Arrived at home he would like to eat the sheep at once, but\r\nhe is afraid of being followed, so the animal is put in the cradle and\r\nwrapped up to resemble a baby, and Mak goes back to take his place among\r\nthe shepherds. Before long these awake and rouse Mak, who, pretending he\r\nhas dreamt that Gill his wife has been brought to bed of another child,\r\ngoes off home. The shepherds miss one of their sheep and, following him,\r\nfind Gill on the bed while Mak sings a lullaby at the cradle. They proceed\r\nto search the house, Gill the while praying she may eat the child in the\r\ncradle if ever she deceived them. They find nothing, and are about to\r\ndepart when Daw insists on kissing the new baby. Gill vows she saw the\r\nchild changed by an elf as the clock struck midnight, but Mak pleads\r\nguilty and gets off with a blanketing.\r\n\r\nSo far, intentionally in the case of the drama, and if not intentionally\r\nat least practically in that of the ballads, the appeal of the native\r\npastoral impulse--tradition it could hardly yet be called--was to an\r\naudience little if at all removed from the actual condition of life\r\ndepicted. This ensured at least essential reality, for though in the one\r\ncase there may be idealization in a romantic and in the other in a\r\nburlesque direction, either implies that familiarity with the actual world\r\nwhich appears to underlie all vital art.[79] It was not long, however,\r\nbefore the pastoral began to address itself to a more cultivated society,\r\nand in so doing sacrificed that wholesome corrective of a genuinely\r\ncritical audience which is needed in the long run to keep any literary\r\nform from degeneration. The impulse is still, however, found in all its\r\nfreshness and genuineness in such a poem as the following\r\nfifteenth-century nativity carol, which, in its blending of piety and\r\nhumorous rusticity, is strongly reminiscent of the dramatic productions we\r\nhave just been reviewing:\r\n\r\n    The shepherd upon a hill he sat,\r\n    He had on him his tabard and his hat,\r\n    His tar-box, his pipe, and his flagat,\r\n    His name was called Jolly, Jolly Wat!\r\n      For he was a good herds-boy,\r\n              Ut hoy!\r\n      For in his pipe he made so much joy.\r\n         Can I not sing but hoy.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The shepherd on a hill he stood,\r\n    Round about him his sheep they yode,\r\n    He put his hand under his hood,\r\n    He saw a star as red as blood.\r\n              Ut hoy! &c.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Now must I go there Christ was born,\r\n    Farewell! I come again to-morn,\r\n    Dog, keep well my sheep fro the corn!\r\n    And warn well Warroke when I blow my horn!\r\n              Ut hoy! &c.[80]\r\n\r\nSo, again, in the delightful poem that has won for Robert Henryson the\r\ntitle of the first English pastoralist the warm blood of natural feeling\r\nyet runs full. _Robene and Makyne_ stands on the threshold of the\r\nsixteenth century, a modest and pastoral counterpart of the _Nut-Brown\r\nMaid_, as evidence that there were poets of purely native inspiration\r\ncapable of writing verses every whit as perfect in form as anything\r\nproduced by the Italianizers of the next generation, and commonly far more\r\ngenuine in feeling. Even in the work of Surrey and Wyatt themselves we\r\nfind poems which, were it not for the general tradition to which they\r\nbelong, one would have no difficulty in regarding as a natural development\r\nand conventionalization of the native tendency. Such is the _Harpelus'\r\nComplaint_ of 'Tottel's Miscellany.' This was originally printed among\r\nthe poems of uncertain authors, but when it re-appeared in _England's\r\nHelicon_, in 1600, it was subscribed with Surrey's name. The ascription\r\ndoes not carry with it much authority, but is in no way inherently\r\nimprobable.[81] The opening stanzas may be quoted as conveying a fair idea\r\nof the whole, which sustains its character of sprightly elegance for over\r\na hundred lines, ending with the luckless Harpelus' epitaph:\r\n\r\n    Phylida was a fayer mayde,\r\n      And fresh as any flowre:\r\n    Whom Harpalus the herdman prayed\r\n      To be his paramour.\r\n\r\n    Harpalus and eke Corin\r\n      Were herdmen both yfere:\r\n    And Phillida could twist and spin\r\n      And therto sing full clere.\r\n\r\n    But Phillida was all to coy\r\n      For Harpelus to winne.\r\n    For Corin was her onely joye,\r\n      Who forst her not a pynne.[82]\r\n\r\nThe relation of the early Italianizers to pastoral is rather strange.\r\nPastoral names, imagery and conventions are freely scattered throughout\r\ntheir works, yet with the exception of the above there is scarcely a poem\r\nto which the term pastoral can be properly applied. They borrowed from\r\ntheir models a kind of pastoral diction merely, not their partiality for\r\nthe form: 'shepherd' is with them merely another word for lover or poet,\r\nwhile almost any act of such may be described as 'folding his sheep' or\r\nthe like. Allegory has reduced itself to a few stock phrases. In this\r\nfashion Surrey complains to his fair Geraldine, and a whole company of\r\nunknown lovers celebrate the cruelty and beauty of their ladies. It is\r\nrarely that we catch a note of fresher reminiscence or more spontaneous\r\nsong as in Wyatt's:\r\n\r\n      Ah, Robin!\r\n      Joly Robin!\r\n    Tell me how thy leman doth!\r\n\r\nHappily the seed of Phillida's coyness bore fruit, and the amorous\r\npastoral ballad or picture, a true _idyllion_, became a recognized type in\r\nEnglish verse. It certainly owed something to foreign pastoral models,\r\nand, like the bulk of Elizabethan lyrics, a good deal to Italian poetry in\r\ngeneral; but in its freshness and variety, as in its tendency to narrative\r\nform, it asserts its independence of any rigid tradition, and justifies us\r\nin regarding it as an outcome of that native impulse which we have already\r\nnoticed. Such a poem is Nicholas Breton's ever charming _Phyllida and\r\nCorydon_, printed above his signature in _England's Helicon_.[83] Although\r\nwe are thereby anticipating, it may be quoted as a representative specimen\r\nof its kind:\r\n\r\n    In the merry month of May,\r\n    In a morn by break of day,\r\n    Forth I walk'd by a wood-side,\r\n    When as May was in his pride:\r\n    There I spièd all alone,\r\n    Phyllida and Corydone.\r\n    Much ado there was, God wot!\r\n    He would love and she would not.\r\n    She said, never man was true;\r\n    He said, none was false to you.\r\n    He said, he had loved her long;\r\n    She said, Love should have no wrong.\r\n    Corydon would kiss her then;\r\n    She said, maids must kiss no men,\r\n    Till they did for good and all;\r\n    Then she made the shepherd call\r\n    All the heavens to witness truth\r\n    Never loved a truer youth.\r\n    Thus with many a pretty oath,\r\n    Yea and nay, and faith and troth,\r\n    Such as silly shepherds use\r\n    When they will not Love abuse,\r\n    Love which had been long deluded\r\n    Was with kisses sweet concluded;\r\n    And Phyllida, with garlands gay,\r\n    Was made the lady of the May.\r\n\r\nWe must now turn to the beginnings of regular pastoral tradition in this\r\ncountry, springing up under direct foreign influence and in conscious and\r\navowed imitation of specific foreign models. Passing over the Latin\r\neclogues of Buchanan and John Barclay, as belonging properly to the sphere\r\nof humanistic rather than of English letters, we come to the pretty\r\nthoroughly Latinized pastorals of Alexander Barclay and Barnabe Googe.\r\nTheir preoccupation with the humanistic poets is, in Barclay's case at any\r\nrate, no less dominant a factor than in that of the regular translators,\r\nfrom whom it is neither very easy nor clearly desirable to distinguish\r\nthem. Of the professed translators themselves it may be well to say a few\r\nwords in this place and allow them at once to resume their veil of\r\nwell-deserved oblivion. Their influence may be taken as non-existent, and\r\ntheir only interest lies in the indication they afford of the trend of\r\nliterary fashion. The earliest was George Turberville, who in 1567\r\ntranslated the first nine of Mantuan's eclogues into English fourteeners.\r\nThe verse is fairly creditable, but the exaggeration of style,\r\nendeavouring by sheer brutality of phrase to force the moral judgement it\r\nlacks the art of more subtly stimulating, produces neither a very pleasing\r\nnor a very edifying effect. This translation went through three editions\r\nbefore the end of the century. The whole ten eclogues did not find a\r\ntranslator till 1656, when Thomas Harvey published a version in\r\ndecasyllabic couplets. The next poet to appear in English dress was\r\nTheocritus, of whose works 'Six Idillia, that is, Six Small, or Petty,\r\nPoems, or Aeglogues,' were translated by an anonymous hand and dedicated\r\nto E. D.--probably or possibly Sir Edward Dyer--in 1588. As before, the\r\nverse, mostly fourteeners, is far from bad, but the selection is not very\r\nmuch to our purpose. Three of the pieces, a singing match, a love\r\ncomplaint, and one of the Galatea poems, are more or less pastoral; but\r\nthe rest--among which is the dainty conceit of Venus and the boar well\r\nrendered in a three-footed measure--do not belong to bucolic verse at all.\r\nIncidental mention may be also made of a 'dialogue betwixt two sea nymphs,\r\nDoris and Galatea, concerning Polyphemus, briefly translated out of\r\nLucian,' by Giles Fletcher the elder, in his _Licia_ of 1593; and a\r\nversion of 'The First Eidillion of Moschus describing Love,' in Barnabe\r\nBarnes' _Parthenophil and Parthenophe_, which probably appeared the same\r\nyear. Lastly we have the Bucolics and Georgics of Vergil, translated in\r\n1589 by Abraham Fleming into rimeless fourteeners.[84] Besides these there\r\nare a few odd translations from Vergil among the experiments of the\r\nclassical versifiers. Webbe, in his _Discourse of English Poetry_ (1586),\r\ngives hexametrical translations of the first and second eclogues, while\r\nanother version of the second in the same metre appears first in Fraunce's\r\n_Lawyer's Logic_ (1588), and again with corrections in his _Ivychurch_\r\n(1591).[85] Several further translations followed in the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nBut one step, and that a short one, removed from these writers is\r\nAlexander Barclay, translater of Brandt's _Stultifera Navis_, priest and\r\nmonk successively of Ottery St. Mary, Ely, and Canterbury. It seems to\r\nhave been about 1514, when at the second of these houses, that he composed\r\nat least the earlier and larger portion of his eclogues. They appeared at\r\nvarious dates, the first complete edition being appended, long after the\r\nwriter's death, to the _Ship of Fools_ of 1570.[86] They are there headed\r\n'Certayne Egloges of Alexander Barclay Priest, Whereof the first three\r\nconteyne the misereyes of Courtiers and Courtes of all princes in\r\ngenerall, Gathered out of a booke named in Latin, Miseriae Curialium,\r\ncompiled by Eneas Silvius[87] Poet and Oratour.' This sufficiently\r\nindicates what we are to expect of Barclay as of the Latin eclogists of\r\nthe previous century. The interlocutors in these three poems are Coridon,\r\na young shepherd anxious to seek his fortune at court, and the old Cornix,\r\nfor whom the great world has long lost its glamour. The fourth eclogue,\r\n'treating of the behavour of Rich men against Poets,' is similarly 'taken\r\nout of' Mantuan. In it Barclay is supposed to have directed a not very\r\nindividual but pretty lusty satire against Skelton.[88] He also\r\nintroduces, as recited by one of the characters, 'The description of the\r\nTowre of vertue and honour, into which the noble Howarde contended to\r\nenter by worthy actes of chivalry,' a stanzaic composition in honour of\r\nSir Edward Howard, who died in 1513. The fifth eclogue, 'of the\r\ndisputation of Citizens and men of the Countrey,' or the _Cytezen and\r\nUplondyshman_, as it was originally styled, again presents us with a\r\nfamiliar theme treated in the conventional manner, and closes the series.\r\nThese poems are written in what would be decasyllabic couplets were they\r\nreducible to metre--in other words, in the barbarous caesural jangle in\r\nwhich many poets of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries\r\nimagined that they reproduced the music of Chaucer, and which, refashioned\r\nhowever almost beyond recognition by a born metrist, we shall meet again\r\nin the _Shepherd's Calender_. The following lines from the fifth eclogue\r\nmay serve to illustrate Barclay's style:\r\n\r\n    I shall not deny our payne and servitude,\r\n    I knowe that plowmen for the most part be rude,\r\n    Nowe shall I tell thee high matters true and olde,\r\n    Which curteous Candidus unto me once tolde,\r\n    Nought shall I forge nor of no leasing bable,\r\n    This is true history and no surmised fable.\r\n\r\nIt is in justice due to Barclay to say that the fact of his composing this\r\neclogue in the vernacular should possibly be counted to him as an original\r\nstep. The step had, indeed, been taken in Italy before he was born, but of\r\nthis he may, in spite of his travels, have been ignorant. Such credit as\r\nattaches to the innovation should be allowed him.\r\n\r\nA somewhat more independent writer is Barnabe Googe--writer, indeed, as\r\noriginal, may be, as the lesser Latin pastoralists of the renaissance. The\r\nfact of his altering the conventional forms to fit the mood of a sturdy\r\nprotestantism, of a protestantism still bitter from the Marian\r\npersecutions, is scarcely to be regarded so much as evidence of his\r\ninvention as of the stability of literary tradition under the varying\r\nforms imposed by external circumstances. The collection of his poems,\r\n'imprinted at London' in 1563,[89] includes eight eclogues written in\r\nfourteeners, the majority of which may fairly be said to represent Mantuan\r\nadjusted to the conditions of contemporary life in reformation England.\r\nOthers show the influence of the author's visit to Spain in 1561-3. The\r\nbest that can be said for the verse and style is that they pursue their\r\n'middle flight' on the whole modestly, and that the diction is at times\r\nnot without a touch of simple dignity. There are, moreover, moments of\r\ngenuine feeling when the author recalls the fires of Smithfield, and of\r\ngenerous if naïve appreciation when he speaks of his predecessors in\r\nEnglish song. A brief summary of contents will give some idea of the\r\nnature of these poems. The first recounts the pains of love; in the second\r\nDametas rails on the blind boy and ends his song by dying. The third\r\ntreats of the vices of the city, not the least of them being religious\r\npersecution. In the next Melibeus relates how Dametas, having as we now\r\nlearn killed himself for love, appeared to him amid hell-fire. Eclogue V\r\ncontains the pitiful tale of Faustus who courted Claudia through the\r\nagency of Valerius. Claudia unfortunately fell in love with the messenger,\r\nand finding him faithful to his master slew herself. This is imitated, in\r\npart closely, from the tale of the shepherdess Felismena in the second\r\nbook of Montemayor's _Diana_, the identical story upon which Shakespeare\r\nis supposed ultimately to have founded his _Two Gentlemen of Verona_,\r\nthough it is difficult at first sight to trace much resemblance between\r\nthe play and Googe's poem. In the sixth eclogue Faustus--the Don Felix of\r\nthe Spanish and the Proteus of Shakespeare--himself appears, for no better\r\nreason it would seem than to give his interlocutor an opportunity of\r\nenlarging on the delights of country life and introducing the remarks on\r\nfowling borrowed from Sannazzaro by way of Garcilaso's second eclogue. The\r\nnext is a discussion somewhat after the manner of the _Nut-Brown Maid_,\r\nagain paraphrased from the _Diana_ (Book I); while the eighth, lastly, is\r\na homily on the superiority of Christianity over Roman polytheism, in\r\nwhich under obsolete forms the author no doubt intended an allusion to\r\ncontemporary controversies. Thus it will be seen that Googe follows Latin\r\nand Spanish traditions almost exclusively: the only point in which it is\r\npossible to see any native inspiration is in his partiality for some sort\r\nof narrative ballad motive as the subject of his poems.\r\n\r\nSo far the literary quality to be registered has not been high among those\r\nowing allegiance to the regular pastoral tradition. The next step to be\r\ntaken is a long one. The pastoral writings of Spenser not only themselves\r\nbelong to a very different order of work, but likewise brings us face to\r\nface with literary problems of a most complex and interesting kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Shepherd's Calender_ we have the one pastoral composition in\r\nEnglish literature which can boast first-rate historical importance. There\r\nare not a few later productions in the kind which may be reasonably held\r\nto surpass it in poetic merit, but all alike sink into insignificance by\r\nthe side of Spenser's eclogues when the influence they exercised on the\r\nhistory of English verse is taken into account. The present is not of\r\ncourse the place to discuss this wider influence of Spenser's work: it is\r\nwith its relation to pastoral tradition and its influence upon subsequent\r\npastoral work that we are immediately concerned. This is an aspect of the\r\n_Shepherd's Calender_ to which literary historians have naturally devoted\r\nless attention. These two reasons--namely, the intrinsic importance of the\r\nwork and the neglect of its pastoral bearing--must excuse a somewhat\r\nlengthy treatment of a theme that may possibly be regarded as already\r\nsufficiently familiar.\r\n\r\nThe _Shepherd's Calender_[90], which first appeared in 1579, was published\r\nwithout author's name, but with an envoy signed 'Immerito.' It was\r\ndedicated to Sir Philip Sidney, and contained a commentary by one E. K.,\r\nwho also signed an epistle to Master Gabriel Harvey, fellow of Pembroke\r\nCollege, Cambridge. 'Immerito' was a name used by Spenser in his familiar\r\ncorrespondence with Harvey, and can in any case have presented no mystery\r\nto his Cambridge friends. Among these must clearly be reckoned the\r\ncommentator E. K., who may be identified with one Edward Kirke with all\r\nbut absolute certainty.[91] Within certain well defined limits we may also\r\naccept E. K. as a competent exponent of his friend's work, and his\r\nidentity, together with that of Rosalind and Menalcas, being matters of\r\nbut indirect literary interest, may be left to Spenser's editors and\r\nbiographers to fight over. It will be sufficient to add in this place that\r\nhowever 'literary' may have been Spenser's attachment to Rosalind there is\r\nno reason to suppose that she was not a real person, while however little\r\nresponse his advances may have met with there _is_ reason to suppose that\r\nhis sorrow at their rejection was not wholly conventional.\r\n\r\nSpenser's design in turning his attention to the pastoral form would not\r\nseem hard to apprehend. Less readily may we suppose that any deep\r\nphilosophical impulse directed his mind towards certain modes of\r\nexpression, than that in an age of catholic experiment he turned from the\r\npenning of impossible iambic trimeters, 'minding,' as E. K. directly\r\ninforms us, 'to furnish our tongue with this kind, wherein it faulteth.'\r\nHe was qualified for the task by a wide knowledge of previous pastoral\r\nwriters from Theocritus and Bion down to Marot, and deliberately ranged\r\nhimself in line with the previous poets of the regular pastoral\r\ntradition. Yet we find side by side in his work two distinct and\r\napparently antagonistic though equally conscious tendencies; the one\r\ntowards authority, leading him to borrow motives freely and even to resort\r\nto direct paraphrase; the other towards individuality, nationality,\r\nfreedom, informing his general scheme and regulating the language of his\r\nimaginary swains. It is this double nature of his pastoral work that\r\njustifies us as regarding him, in spite of his alleged orthodoxy, as in\r\nreality the first of a series of English writers who combined the\r\ntraditions of regular pastoral with the wayward graces of native\r\ninspiration. It is true that in Spenser the natural pastoral impulse has\r\nlost the spontaneity of the earlier examples, and has passed into the\r\nrealm of conscious and deliberate art; but it is none the less there,\r\nmodifying the conventional form. The individual debts owed by Spenser to\r\nearlier writers have been collected with admirable learning and industry\r\nby scholars such as Kluge and Reissert[92], but the investigation of his\r\noriginality presents at once a more interesting and more important field\r\nof inquiry. So, indeed, Spenser himself appears to have thought, for the\r\nonly direct acknowledgement he makes in the work is to Chaucer, although,\r\nas a writer to whom the humours of criticism are ever present has\r\nremarked, 'it might almost seem that Spenser borrowed from Chaucer nothing\r\nbut his sly way of acknowledging indebtedness chiefly where it was not\r\ndue.'\r\n\r\nThe chief point of originality in the _Calender_ is the attempt at linking\r\nthe separate eclogues into a connected series. We have already seen how\r\nwith Googe the same characters recur in a sort of shadowy story; but what\r\nwas in his case vague and almost unintentional becomes with Spenser a\r\ncentral artistic motive of the piece. The eclogues are arranged with no\r\nsmall skill and care on somewhat of an architectural design, or perhaps we\r\nshould rather say with somewhat of the symmetry of a geometrical pattern.\r\nThis will best be seen in a brief analysis of the several eclogues,\r\n'proportionable,' as the title is careful to inform us, 'to the twelve\r\nmonethes.'\r\n\r\nIn the 'January,' a monologue, Spenser, under the disguise of Colin\r\nClout, laments the ill-success of his love for Rosalind, who meets his\r\nadvances with scorn. He also alludes to his friendship with Harvey, who is\r\nintroduced throughout under the name of Hobbinol. The 'February' is a\r\ndisputation between youth and age in the persons of Cuddie and Thenot. It\r\nintroduces the fable of the oak and the briar, in which, since he ascribes\r\nit to Tityrus, a name he transferred from Vergil to Chaucer, Spenser\r\npresumably imagined he was imitating that poet, though it is really no\r\nmore in the style of Chaucer than is the roughly accentual measure in\r\nwhich the eclogue is composed. For the 'March' Spenser recasts in English\r\nsurroundings Bion's fantasy of the fight with Cupid, without however\r\nachieving any conspicuous success. In the April eclogue Hobbinol recites\r\nto the admiring Thenot Colin's lay\r\n\r\n      Of fayre Eliza, Queene of shepheardes all,\r\n    Which once he made as by a spring he laye,\r\n      And tuned it unto the Waters fall.\r\n\r\nThis lay is in an intricate lyrical stanza which Spenser shows\r\nconsiderable skill in handling. The following lines, for instance, already\r\nshow the musical modulation characteristic of much of his best work:\r\n\r\n    See, where she sits upon the grassie greene,\r\n      (O seemely sight!)\r\n    Yclad in Scarlot, like a mayden Queene,\r\n      And ermines white:\r\n    Upon her head a Cremosin coronet,\r\n    With Damaske roses and Daffadillies set:\r\n      Bay leaves betweene,\r\n      And primroses greene,\r\n    Embellish the sweete Violet.\r\n\r\nIn the 'May' we return to the four-beat accentual measure, this time\r\napplied to a discussion by the herdsmen Palinode and Piers of the\r\nlawfulness of Sunday sports and the corruption of the clergy. Here we have\r\na common theme treated from an individual point of view. The eclogue is\r\ninteresting as showing that the author, whose opinions are placed in the\r\nmouth of the precise Piers; belonged to what Ben Jonson later styled 'the\r\nsourer sort of shepherds.' A fable is again introduced which is of a\r\npronounced Aesopic cast. In the 'June' we return to the love-motive of\r\nRosalind, which, though alluded to in the April eclogue, has played no\r\nprominent part since January. It is a dialogue between Colin and Hobbinol,\r\nin which the former recounts his final defeat and the winning of Rosalind\r\nby Menalcas. This eclogue contains Spenser's chief tribute to Chaucer:\r\n\r\n    The God of shepheards, Tityrus, is dead,\r\n    Who taught me homely, as I can, to make;\r\n    He, whilst he lived, was the soveraigne head\r\n    Of shepheards all that bene with love ytake:\r\n    Well couth he wayle his Woes, and lightly slake\r\n    The flames which love within his heart had bredd,\r\n    And tell us mery tales to keepe us wake\r\n    The while our sheepe about us safely fedde.\r\n\r\nThe July eclogue again leads us into the realm of ecclesiastical politics.\r\nIt is a disputation between upland and lowland shepherds, the descendant\r\ntherefore of Mantuan and Barclay, though the use of 'high places' as\r\ntypifying prelatical pride appears to be original. The confusion of things\r\nChristian and things pagan, of classical mythology with homely English\r\nscenery, nowhere reaches a more extravagant pitch than here. Morrell, the\r\nadvocate of the old religion, defends the hills with the ingeniously\r\nwrong-headed argument:\r\n\r\n    And wonned not the great God Pan\r\n      Upon mount Olivet,\r\n    Feeding the blessed flocke of Dan,\r\n      Which dyd himselfe beget?\r\n\r\nor else, gazing over the Kentish downs, he announces that\r\n\r\n    Here han the holy Faunes recourse,\r\n      And Sylvanes haunten rathe;\r\n    Here has the salt Medway his source,\r\n      Wherein the Nymphes doe bathe.\r\n\r\nIn the 'August' Spenser again handles a familiar theme with more or less\r\nattempt at novelty. Willie and Peregot meeting on the green lay wagers in\r\northodox fashion, and, appointing Cuddie judge, begin their singing\r\nmatch. The 'roundel' that follows, a song inserted in the midst of\r\ndecasyllabic stanzas, is composed of alternate lines sung by the two\r\ncompetitors. The verse is of the homeliest; indeed it is only a rollicking\r\nindifference to its own inanity that saves it from sheer puerility and\r\ngives it a careless and as it were impromptu charm of its own. Even in an\r\nage of experiment it must have needed some self-confidence to write the\r\ndialect of the _Calender_; it must have required nothing less than\r\nassurance to put forth such verses as the following:\r\n\r\n    It fell upon a holy eve,\r\n      Hey, ho, hollidaye!\r\n    When holy fathers wont to shrieve;\r\n      Now gynneth this roundelay.\r\n    Sitting upon a hill so hye,\r\n      Hey, ho, the high hyll!\r\n    The while my flocke did feede thereby;\r\n      The while the shepheard selfe did spill.\r\n    I saw the bouncing Bellibone,\r\n      Hey, ho, Bonibell!\r\n    Tripping over the dale alone,\r\n      She can trippe it very well.\r\n\r\nMany a reader of the anonymous quarto of 1579 must have joined in Cuddie's\r\nexclamation:\r\n\r\n    Sicker, sike a roundel never heard I none!\r\n\r\nSidney, we know, was not altogether pleased with the homeliness of the\r\nverses dedicated to him; and there must have been not a few among\r\nSpenser's academic friends to feel a certain incongruity between the\r\npolished tradition of the Theocritean singing match and the present poem.\r\nMoreover, as if to force the incongruity upon the notice of the least\r\nsensitive of his readers, Spenser followed up the ballad with a poem which\r\nis not only practically free from obsolete or dialectal phrasing, but\r\nwhich is composed in the wearisomely pedantic _sestina_ form. This song is\r\nattributed to Colin, whose love for Rosalind is again mentioned.\r\n\r\nPassing to the 'September' we find an eclogue of the 'wise shepherd' type.\r\nIt is composed in the rough accentual metre, and opens with a couplet\r\nwhich roused the ire of Dr. Johnson:\r\n\r\n    Diggon Davie! I bidde her god day;\r\n    Or Diggon her is, or I missaye.\r\n\r\nDiggon is a shepherd, who, in hope of gain, drove his flock into a far\r\ncountry, and coming home the poorer, relates to Hobbinol the evil ways of\r\nforeign shepherds among whom,\r\n\r\n       playnely to speake of shepheards most what,\r\n    Badde is the best.\r\n\r\nThe 'October' eclogue belongs to the stanzaic group, and consists of a\r\ndialogue on the subject of poetry between the shepherds Piers and Cuddie.\r\nIt is one of the most imaginative of the series, and in it Spenser has\r\nrefashioned time-honoured themes with more conspicuous taste than\r\nelsewhere. The old complaint for the neglect of poetry acquires new life\r\nthrough the dramatic contrast of the two characters in which opposite\r\nsides of the poetic temperament are revealed. In Cuddie we have a poet for\r\nwhom the prize is more than the praise[93], whose inspiration is cramped\r\nbecause of the indifference of a worldly court and society. Things were\r\nnot always so--\r\n\r\n    But ah! Mecaenas is yclad in claye,\r\n    And great Augustus long ygoe is dead,\r\n    And all the worthies liggen wrapt in leade,\r\n    That matter made for Poets on to play.\r\n\r\nAnd in the same strain he laments over what might have been his song:\r\n\r\n    Thou kenst not, Percie, howe the ryme should rage,\r\n    O! if my temples were distaind with wine,\r\n    And girt with girlonds of wild Yvie twine,\r\n    How I could reare the Muse on stately stage,\r\n    And teache her tread aloft in buskin fine,\r\n    With queint Bellona in her equipage!\r\n\r\nReading these words to-day they may well seem to us the charter of the new\r\nage of England's song; and the effect is rendered all the more striking\r\nby the rhythm of the last line with its prophecy of Marlowe and mighty\r\nmusic to come. Piers, on the other hand, though with less poetic rage, is\r\na truer idealist, and approaches the high things of poetry more\r\nreverentially than his Bacchic comrade. When Cuddie, acknowledging his own\r\nunworthiness, adds:\r\n\r\n    For Colin fittes such famous flight to scanne;\r\n    He, were he not with love so ill bedight,\r\n    Would mount as high, and sing as soote as Swanne;\r\n\r\nPiers breaks out in words fitting the poet of the _Hymnes_:\r\n\r\n    Ah, fon! for love doth teach him climbe so hie,\r\n    And lyftes him up out of the loathsome myre.\r\n\r\nAnd throughout this high discourse the homely names of Piers and Cuddie\r\nseem somehow more appropriate, or at least touch us more nearly, than\r\nMantuan's Sylvanus and Candidus, as if, in spite of all Spenser owes to\r\nforeign models, he were yet conscious of a latent power of simple native\r\ninspiration, capable, when once fully awakened, of standing up naked and\r\nunshamed in the presence of Italy and Greece. One might well question\r\nwhether there is not more of the true spirit of prophecy in this poem of\r\nSpenser's than ever went to the composition of Vergil's _Pollio_.\r\n\r\nThe 'November,' like the 'April,' consists for the most part of a lay\r\ncomposed in an elaborate stanza--there a panegyric, here an elegy. This\r\ntime it is sung by Colin himself, and we again find reference to the\r\nRosalind motive. The subject of the threnody is a nymph of the name of\r\nDido, whose identity can only be vaguely conjectured. The chief point of\r\nexternal form in which Spenser has departed from his model, namely Marot's\r\ndirge for Loyse de Savoye, and from other pastoral elegies, is in the use\r\nof a different form of verse in the actual lament from that in which the\r\nsetting of the poem is composed. Otherwise he has followed tradition none\r\nthe less closely for having infused the conventional form with a poetry of\r\nhis own. The change by which the lament passes into the song of rejoicing\r\nis traditional--and though borrowed by Spenser from Marot, is as old as\r\nVergil. Both Browne and Milton later made use of the same device. Spenser\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n    Why wayle we then? why weary we the Gods with playnts,\r\n    As if some evill were to her betight?\r\n    She raignes a goddesse now emong the saintes,\r\n    That whilome was the saynt of shepheards light,\r\n    And is enstalled nowe in heavens hight.\r\n      I see thee, blessed soule, I see\r\n      Walke in Elisian fieldes so free.\r\n      O happy herse!\r\n    Might I once come to thee, (O that I might!)\r\n      O joyfull verse!\r\n\r\nAlthough some critics, looking too exclusively to the poetic merit of the\r\n_Calender_ as the cause of its importance, have perhaps overestimated the\r\nbeauty of this and the April lyrics, the skill with which the intricate\r\nstanzas are handled must be apparent to any careful reader. As the\r\n_Calender_ in poetry generally, so even more decidedly in their own\r\ndepartment, do these songs mark a distinct advance in formal evolution.\r\nJust as they were themselves foreshadowed in the recurrent melody of\r\nWyatt's farewell to his lute--\r\n\r\n    My lute, awake! perform the last\r\n    Labour that thou and I shall waste,\r\n      And end that I have now begun;\r\n    For when this song is sung and past,\r\n      My lute, be still, for I have done--\r\n\r\nso they in their turn heralded the full strophic sonority of the\r\n_Epithalamium_.\r\n\r\nLastly, in the 'December' we have the counterpart of the January eclogue,\r\na monologue in which Colin laments his wasted life and joyless, for\r\n\r\n      Winter is come, that blowes the balefull breath,\r\n      And after Winter commeth timely death.\r\n\r\n    Adieu, delightes, that lulled me asleepe;\r\n    Adieu, my deare, whose love I bought so deare;\r\n    Adieu, my little Lambes and loved sheepe;\r\n    Adieu, ye Woodes, that oft my witnesse were:\r\n      Adieu, good Hobbinoll, that was so true,\r\n      Tell Rosalind, her Colin bids her adieu.[94]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the above analysis that the architectonic basis of\r\nSpenser's design consists of the three Colin eclogues standing\r\nrespectively at the beginning, in the middle, and at the close of the\r\nyear. These are symmetrically arranged: the 'January' and 'December' are\r\nboth alike monologues and agree in the stanza used, while the 'June' is a\r\ndialogue and likewise differs in metrical form. This latter is supported\r\nas it were by two subsidiary eclogues, those of April and August, in both\r\nof which another shepherd sings one of Colin's lays and refers\r\nincidentally to his passion for Rosalind. It is upon this framework that\r\nare woven the various moral, polemical, and idyllic themes which Spenser\r\nintroduces. The attempt at uniting a series of poems into a single fabric\r\nis Spenser's chief contribution to the formal side of pastoral\r\ncomposition. The method by which he sought to correlate the various parts\r\nso as to produce the singleness of impression necessary to a work of art,\r\nand the measure of success which he achieved, though they belong more\r\nstrictly to the general history of poetry, must also detain us for a\r\nmoment. The chief and most obvious device is that suggested by the\r\ntitle--_The Shepherd's Calender_--'Conteyning twelve Aeglogues\r\nproportionable to the twelve monethes.' This might, indeed, have been no\r\nmore than a fanciful name for any series of twelve poems;[95] with Spenser\r\nit indicates a conscious principle of artistic construction. It suggests,\r\nwhat is moreover apparent from the eclogues themselves, that the author\r\nintended to represent the spring and fall of the year as typical of the\r\nlife of man. The moods of the various poems were to be made to correspond\r\nwith the seasons represented; or, conversely, outward nature in its cycle\r\nthrough the year was to reflect and thereby unify the emotions, thoughts,\r\nand passions of the shepherds. This was a perfectly legitimate artistic\r\ndevice, and one based on a fundamental principle of our nature, since the\r\nappearance of objective phenomena is ever largely modified and coloured by\r\nsubjective feeling. Nor can it reasonably be objected against the device\r\nthat in the hands of inferior craftsmen it degenerates but too readily\r\ninto the absurdities of the 'pathetic fallacy,' or that Spenser himself is\r\nnot wholly guiltless of the charge.\r\n\r\n    Winter is come, that blowes the balefull breath,\r\n    And after Winter commeth timely death.\r\n\r\nThese lines bear witness to Spenser's intention. But the conceit is not\r\nfully or consistently carried out. In several of the eclogues not only\r\ndoes the subject in no way reflect the mood of the season--the very nature\r\nof the theme at times made this impossible--but the time of year is not so\r\nmuch as mentioned. This is more especially the case in the summer months;\r\nthere is no joy of the 'hygh seysoun,' and when it is mentioned it is\r\nrather by way of contrast than of sympathy. Thus in June Colin mourns for\r\nother days:\r\n\r\n    Tho couth I sing of love, and tune my pype\r\n    Unto my plaintive pleas in verses made:\r\n    Tho would I seeke for Queene-apples unrype,\r\n    To give my Rosalind; and in Sommer shade\r\n    Dight gaudy Girlonds was my common trade,\r\n    To crowne her golden locks: but yeeres more rype,\r\n    And losse of her, whose love as lyfe I wayd,\r\n    Those weary wanton toyes away dyd wype.\r\n\r\nIn the same eclogue we may trace a deliberate contrast between various\r\ndescriptive passages. Thus Hobbinol feels the magie of the summer woods--\r\n\r\n    Colin, to heare thy rymes and roundelayes,\r\n    Which thou were wont on wastfull hylls to singe,\r\n    I more delight then larke in Sommer dayes:\r\n    Whose Echo made the neyghbour groves to ring,\r\n    And taught the byrds, which in the lower spring\r\n    Did shroude in shady leaves from sonny rayes,\r\n    Frame to thy songe their chereful cheriping,\r\n    Or hold theyr peace, for shame of thy swete layes.\r\n\r\nClosely following upon this stanza we have Colin's lament, 'The God of\r\nshepheards, Tityrus, is dead,' containing the lines:\r\n\r\n    But, if on me some little drops would flowe\r\n    Of that the spring was in his learned hedde,\r\n    I soone would learne these woods to wayle my woe,\r\n    And teache the trees their trickling teares to shedde.\r\n\r\nWe have here a specifie inversion of the 'pathetic fallacy.' The moods of\r\nnature are no longer represented as varying in sympathy with the passions\r\nof man, but are deliberately used to heighten an effect by contrast. Even\r\nthis inverted correspondence, however, is for the most part lacking in the\r\nsubsequent eclogues, and it must be admitted that in so far as Spenser\r\ndepended on a cyclic correlation for the unifying of his design, he\r\nachieved at best but partial effect. Another means by which he sought,\r\nconsciously or unconsciously, to produce unity of impression was by\r\nconsistently pitching his song in the minor key. This accounts for the\r\ninverted correspondence just noted, and for the fact that even the\r\npolemics have an undercurrent of regret in them. In this case the poet has\r\nundoubtedly succeeded in carrying out the prevailing mood of the central\r\nmotive--the Rosalind drama--in the subsidiary scenes. Or should we not\r\nrather say that he has extracted the general mood of the whole\r\ncomposition, and infused it, in a kind of typical form, into the three\r\nconnected poems placed at critical points of the complex structure? The\r\nunity, however, thus aimed at, and achieved, is very different from the\r\ncyclic or architectonic unity described above, and of a much less definite\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIt remains to say a few words concerning the language of the _Calender_\r\nand the rough accentual metre in which parts of it are composed, since\r\nboth have a particular bearing upon Spenser's attitude towards pastoral in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nBen Jonson, in one of those utterances which have won for him the\r\nreputation of churlishness, but which are often marked by acute critical\r\nsense, asserted that Spenser 'in affecting the Ancients writ no\r\nLanguage.'[96] The remark applies first and foremost, of course, to the\r\n_Calender_, and opens up the whole question of archaism and provincialism\r\nin literature. This is far too wide a question to receive adequate\r\ntreatment here, and yet it appears forced upon us by the nature of the\r\ncase. For Spenser's archaism, in his pastoral work at least, is no\r\nunmeaning affectation as Jonson implies. He perceived that the language of\r\nChaucer bore a closer resemblance to actual rustic speech than did the\r\nliterary language of his own day, and he adopted it for his imaginary\r\nshepherds as a fitting substitute for the actual folk-tongue with which he\r\nhad grown familiar, whether in the form of rugged Lancashire or\r\nfull-mouthed Kentish. And the homely dialect does undoubtedly naturalize\r\nthe characters of his eclogues, and disguise the time-honoured platitudes\r\nthat they repeat from their learned predecessors. With our wider\r\nappreciation of literary effect, and our more historical and less\r\nauthoritative manner of judging works of art, we can no longer endorse\r\nSidney's famous criticism:[97] 'That same framing of his stile, to an old\r\nrustick language, I dare not alowe, sith neyther Theocritus in Greeke,\r\nVirgill in Latine, nor Sanazar in Italian, did affect it.'[98] If a writer\r\nfinds an effective and picturesque word in an old author or in a homely\r\ndialect it is but pedantry that opposes its use, and it matters little\r\nmoreover from what quarter of the land it may hail, as Stevenson knew when\r\nhe claimed the right of mingling Ayrshire with his Lothian verse. Even\r\nsuch archaisms as 'deemen' and 'thinken,' such colloquialisms as the\r\npronominal possessive, need not be too severely criticized. What goes far\r\ntowards justifying Jonson's acrimony is the wanton confusion of different\r\ndialectal forms; the indiscriminate use for the mere sake of archaism of\r\nsuch variants as 'gate' beside the usual 'goat,' of 'sike' and 'sich'\r\nbeside 'such'; the coining of words like 'stanck,' apparently from the\r\nItalian _stanco_; and lastly, the introduction of forms which owe their\r\norigin to mere etymological ignorance, for instance, 'yede' as an\r\ninfinitive, 'behight' in the same sense as the simple verb, 'betight,'\r\n'gride,' and many others--all of which do not tend to produce the homely\r\neffect of mother English, but reek of all that is pedantic and\r\nunnatural.[99]\r\n\r\nThe influence of Chaucer was not confined to the language: from him\r\nSpenser borrowed the metre of a considerable portion of the _Calender_. It\r\nmay at first sight appear strange to attribute to imitation of Chaucer's\r\nsmooth, carefully ordered verse the rather rugged measure of, say, the\r\nFebruary eclogue, but a little consideration will, I fancy, leave no doubt\r\nupon the subject. This measure is roughly reducible to four beats with a\r\nvarying number of syllables in the _theses_, being thus purely accentual\r\nas distinguished from the more strictly syllabic measures of Chaucer\r\nhimself on the one hand and the English Petrarchists on the other. Take\r\nthe following example:\r\n\r\n    The soveraigne of seas he blames in vaine,\r\n    That, once sea-beate, will to sea againe:\r\n    So loytring live you little heardgroomes,\r\n    Keeping you beastes in the budded broomes:\r\n    And, when the shining sunne laugheth once,\r\n    You deemen the Spring is come attonce;\r\n    Tho gynne you, fond flyes! the cold to scorne,\r\n    And, crowing in pypes made of greene corn,\r\n    You thinken to be Lords of the yeare;\r\n    But eft, when ye count you freed from feare,\r\n    Cornes the breme Winter with chamfred browes,\r\n    Full of wrinckles and frostie furrowes,\r\n    Drerily shooting his stormy darte,\r\n    Which cruddles the blood and pricks the harte:\r\n    Then is your carelesse corage accoied,\r\n    Your careful heards with cold bene annoied:\r\n    Then paye you the price of your surquedrie,\r\n    With weeping, and wailing, and misery.[100]\r\n\r\nThe syllabic value of the final _e_, already weakening in the London of\r\nChaucer's later days, was more or less of an archaism even with his most\r\nimmediate followers, none of whom use it with his unvarying correctness,\r\nand it soon became literally a dead letter. The change was a momentous\r\none for English prosody, and none of the fifteenth-century writers\r\npossessed sufficient poetic genius to adapt their verse to the altered\r\nconditions of the language. They lived from hand to mouth, as it were,\r\nwithout arriving at any systematic tradition. Thus it was that at the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century Hawes could write such verse as:\r\n\r\n    Of dame Astronomy I dyd take my lycence\r\n    For to travayle to the toure of Chyvalry;\r\n    For al my minde, wyth percyng influence,\r\n    Was sette upon the most fayre lady\r\n    La Bell Pucell, so muche ententyfly,\r\n    That every daye I dyd thinke fyftene,\r\n    Tyl I agayne had her swete person sene.[101]\r\n\r\nIt is this prosody, dependent usually upon a strong caesural pause to\r\ndifferentiate it from prose, which may account for the harshness of some\r\nof Wyatt's verse, and which rendered possible the barbarous metre of\r\nBarclay. It was obviously impossible for a poet with an ear like Spenser\r\nto accept such a metrical scheme as this; but his own study of Chaucer\r\nproduced a somewhat strange result. The one point which the late\r\nChaucerians preserved of their master's metric was the five-stress\r\ncharacter of his decasyllabic line; but in Spenser's day all memory of the\r\nsyllabic _e_ had long since vanished, and the only rhythm to be extracted\r\nfrom Chaucer's verse was of a four-stress type. Professor Herford quotes a\r\npassage from the Prologue of the _Canterbury Tales_ as it appears in\r\nThynne's second edition (1542), which Spenser would inevitably have read\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    When zéphirus éke wyth hýs sote bréth\r\n    Enspýred hath évery hólte and héth,\r\n    The téndre cróppes, and the yóng sónne\r\n    Háth in the Rám halfe hys cóurse yrónne,\r\n    And smále foules máken mélodýe\r\n    That slépen al nýght with ópen éye, &c.\r\n\r\nThis certainly bears on the face of it a close resemblance to Spenser's\r\nmeasure. There are, moreover, occasional difficulties in this method of\r\nscansion, some lines refusing to accommodate themselves to the Procrustean\r\nmethods of sixteenth-century editors, and exactly similar anomalies are to\r\nbe found in Spenser. Such, for instance, are the lines in the May eclogue:\r\n\r\n    Tho opened he the dore, and in came\r\n    The false Foxe, as he were starke lame.\r\n\r\nNow these lines may be written in strict Chaucerian English thus:\r\n\r\n    Tho openëd he the dore, and innë came\r\n    The falsë fox, as he were starkë lamë,\r\n\r\nand they at once become perfectly metrical. Under these circumstances\r\nthere can, I think, be little doubt as to the literary parentage of\r\nSpenser's accentual measure.[102]\r\n\r\nLike the archaic dialect, this homely measure tends to bring Spenser's\r\nshepherds closer to their actual English brethren. And hereby, it should\r\nbe frankly acknowledged, the incongruity of the speakers and their\r\ndiscourse is emphasized and increased. That discourse, it is true, runs on\r\npastoral themes, but the disguise and allegory have worn thin with\r\ncenturies of use. We can no longer separate the words from the allusions,\r\nand consequently we can no longer accept the speakers in their\r\nunsophisticated shepherd's rôle. Yet it was precisely the desire to give\r\nreality to these transparent phantasms that led Spenser to endow them with\r\na rustic speech. Whether he failed or succeeded the paradox of the form\r\nremains about equal.[103]\r\n\r\nThe importance of the _Shepherd's Calender_ was early recognized, not\r\nonly by friendly critics, but by the general public likewise, and six\r\neditions were called for in less than twenty years. Not long after its\r\nappearance John Dove, a Christ Church man, who appears to have been\r\nignorant of the authorship, turned the whole into Latin verse, dedicating\r\nthe manuscript to the Dean.[104] Another Latin version is found in\r\nmanuscript in the British Museum copy of the edition of 1597, and after\r\nundergoing careful revision finally appeared in print in 1653. This was\r\nthe work of one Bathurst, a fellow of Spenser's own college of Pembroke at\r\nCambridge.[105]\r\n\r\nThe _Shepherd's Calender_ was Spenser's chief contribution to pastoral;\r\nindeed it was by so much his most important contribution that it would\r\nhardly be worth while examining the others did they not bear witness to a\r\ncertain change in his attitude towards the pastoral ideal.\r\n\r\nThe first of these later works is the isolated but monumental eclogue\r\nentitled _Colin Clouts come Home again_, of which the dedication to\r\nRaleigh is dated 1591, though it was not published till four years later.\r\nThis, perhaps the longest and most elaborate eclogue ever written,\r\ndescribes how the Shepherd of the Ocean, that is Raleigh, induced Colin\r\nClout, who as before represents Spenser, to leave his rustic retreat in\r\n\r\n                        the cooly shade\r\n    Of the greene alders by the Mallaes shore,\r\n\r\nand try his fortune at the court of the great shepherdess Cynthia, and how\r\nhe ultimately returned to Ireland. The verse marks, as might be expected,\r\na considerable advance in smoothness and command of rhythm over the\r\nnon-lyrical portions of the _Calender_, and the dialect, too, is much less\r\nharsh, being far advanced towards that peculiar poetic diction which\r\nSpenser adopted in his more ambitions work. On the other hand, in spite of\r\na certain _allegrezza_ in the handling, and in spite of the Rosalind wound\r\nbeing at least partially healed, the same minor key prevails as in the\r\nearlier poems. In the spring of the great age of English song Spenser's\r\nnote is like the voice of autumn, not the fruitful autumn of cornfield and\r\norchard, but a premature barrenness of wet and fallen leaves--\r\n\r\n    The woods decay, the woods decay and fall.\r\n\r\nThus though time has purged the bitterness of his sorrow, the regret\r\nremains; his early love is still the mistress of his thoughts, but years\r\nhave softened his reproaches, and he admits:\r\n\r\n      who with blame can justly her upbrayd,\r\n    For loving not; for who can love compell?--\r\n\r\na petard, it may be incidentally remarked, which, sprung within the bounds\r\nof pastoral, is of power to pulverize in an instant the whole artificial\r\nsystem of amatory ethics.\r\n\r\nThe most notable points in the poem are the loves of the rivers Bregog and\r\nMulla, the famous list of contemporary poets, and the presentation of the\r\nseamy side of court life, recalling the more direct satire of the probably\r\ncontemporary _Mother Hubberd's Tale_. The first of these belongs to the\r\nclass of Ovidian myths already noticed in such works as Lorenzo's _Ambra_.\r\nThe subject, however, is treated in a more subtly allegorical manner than\r\nby Ovid's direct imitators, and this mode of presentment likewise\r\ncharacterizes Spenser's tale of Molanna in the fragment on\r\nMutability.[106] Browne returned to a more crudely metamorphical tradition\r\nin the loves of Walla and Tavy, while a similarly mythological\r\n_Naturanschauung_ may be traced in Drayton's chorographical epic.\r\n\r\nOf the miscellaneous _Astrophel_, edited and in part composed by Spenser,\r\nwhich was appended to _Colin Clout_, and of the _Daphnaïda_ published in\r\n1596, though, like the former volume, containing a dedication dated 1591,\r\na passing mention must suffice. The former is chiefly remarkable as\r\nillustrating the uniformly commonplace character of the verse called forth\r\nby the death of one who, while he lived, was held the glory of Elizabethan\r\nchivalry. It contains, beside other verse, pastoral elegies from the pens,\r\ncertainly of Spenser, and probably of the Countess of Pembroke, Matthew\r\nRoydon, and Lodowick Bryskett. The last-named, or at any rate a\r\ncontributor with the same initiais, also supplied a 'Pastorall Aeglogue'\r\non the same theme. _Daphnaïda_ is a long lament in pastoral form on the\r\ndeath of Douglas Howard, daughter of the Earl of Northampton.\r\n\r\nOf far greater importance for our present purpose is the pastoral\r\ninterlude in the quest of Sir Calidore, which occupies the last four\r\ncantos of the sixth book of the _Faery Queen_.[107] Here is told how Sir\r\nCalidore, the knight of courtesy, in his quest of the Blatant Beast came\r\namong the shepherd-folk and fell in love with the fair Pastorella, reputed\r\ndaughter of old Meliboee; how he won her love in return through his valour\r\nand courtesy; how while he was away hunting she was carried off by a band\r\nof robbers; how he followed and rescued her; and finally, how she was\r\ndiscovered to be the daughter of the lord of Belgard--at which point the\r\npoem breaks off abruptly. The story has points of resemblance with the\r\nDorastus and Fawnia, or Florizel and Perdita, legend; but it also has\r\nanother and more important claim upon our attention. For as Shakespeare in\r\n_As You Like It_, so Spenser in this episode has, as it were, passed\r\njudgement upon the pastoral ideal as a whole. He is acutely sensitive to\r\nthe charm of that ideal and the seductions it offers to his hero--\r\n\r\n    Ne, certes, mote he greatly blamed be,\r\n\r\nsays the poet of the _Faery Queen_ recalling the days when he was plain\r\nColin Clout--but the\r\n\r\n                    perfect pleasures, which do grow\r\n    Amongst poore hyndes, in hils, in woods, in dales,\r\n\r\nare not allowed to afford more than a temporary solace to the knight; the\r\nrobbers break in upon the rustic quietude, rapine and murder succeed the\r\npeaceful occupations of the shepherds, and Sir Calidore is driven once\r\nagain to resume his arduous quest. The same idea may be traced in the\r\nknight's visit to the heaven-haunted hill where he meets Colin Clout. In\r\nthe\r\n\r\n         hundred naked maidens lilly white\r\n    All raunged in a ring and dauncing in delight\r\n\r\nto the sound of Colin's bagpipe, and who, together with the Graces and\r\ntheir sovereign lady, vanish at the knight's approach, it is surely not\r\nfanciful to see the gracious shadows of the idyllic poet's vision trooping\r\nreluctantly away at the call of a more lofty theme. With this sense of\r\nregret at the vanishing of an ideal long cherished, but at last\r\ndeliberately abandoned for matters of deeper and more real import, we may\r\nturn from the work of the most important figure in English pastoral poetry\r\nto his less famous contemporaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides its wider influence on English verse, and the stimulus it gave to\r\npastoral composition as a whole, the _Shepherd's Calender_ called forth a\r\nseries of direct imitations. Of these the majority are but of accidental\r\nand ephemeral interest and of inconspicuous merit; and it is probable that\r\nSpenser himself lived to see the end of this over-direct school of\r\ndiscipleship. Several examples appeared in Francis Davison's famous\r\nmiscellany known as the _Poetical Rhapsody_, the first edition of which,\r\nthough it only appeared in 1602, contained the gleanings of the entire\r\nsixteenth century.[108] Of these imitations, four in number, the first,\r\nthe work of the editor himself, is a very poor production. It is a love\r\nlament, and the insertion of a song in a complicated lyrical measure in a\r\nplain stanzaic setting is evidently copied from the _Calender_. The other\r\nthree poems are ascribed, either in the _Rhapsody_ itself or in Davison's\r\nmanuscript list, to a certain A. W., who so far remains unidentified, if,\r\nindeed, the letters conceal any individuality and do not merely stand for\r\n'Anonymous Writer,' as has been sometimes thought. The three eclogues at\r\nany rate bear evidence of coming from the same pen, and the following\r\nlines show that the writer was no incompetent imitator, and at the same\r\ntime argue some genuine feeling:\r\n\r\n    Thou 'ginst as erst forget thy former state,\r\n      And range amid the busks thyself to feed:\r\n    Fair fall thee, little flock! both rathe and late;\r\n      Was never lover's sheep that well did speed.\r\n        Thou free, I bound; thou glad, I pine in pain;\r\n        I strive to die, and thou to live full fain.\r\n\r\nThe first of these poems is a monologue 'entitled Cuddy,' modelled on the\r\nJanuary eclogue. The second is a lament 'made long since upon the death of\r\nSir Philip Sidney,' in which the writer wonders at Colin's silence, and\r\nwhich consequently must, at least, date from before the appearance of\r\n_Astrophel_ in 1595, and is probably some years earlier. It is in the form\r\nof a dialogue between two shepherds, one of whom sings Cuddy's lament in\r\nlyrical stanzas, thus recalling Spenser's 'November.' These stanzas do not\r\nreveal any great metrical gift. The last poem is a fragment 'concerning\r\nold age,' which connects itself by its theme with the February eclogue,\r\nthough the form is stanzaic.[109] Again we find mention of Cuddy, a name\r\nevidently assumed by the author, though whether he can be identified with\r\nthe Cuddie of the _Calender_ it is impossible to say. Whoever he was, he\r\nshows more disposition than most of his fellow imitators to preserve\r\nSpenser's archaisms.\r\n\r\nBut undoubtedly the greatest poet who was content to follow immediately\r\nin Spenser's footsteps was Michael Drayton, who in 1593 published a volume\r\nentitled 'Idea The Shepheards Garland, Fashioned in nine Eglogs. Rowlands\r\nSacrifice to the nine Muses.' This connexion between the number of the\r\neclogues and the muses is purely fanciful; Rowland is Drayton's pastoral\r\nname, and Idea, which re-appeared as the title of the 1594 volume of\r\nsonnets, is that of his poetic mistress.[110] It can hardly be said that\r\nthe verse of these poems attains any very high order of merit, but the\r\nimitation of Spenser is evident throughout. In the first eclogue Rowland\r\nbewails, in the midst of spring, 'the winter of his grief.' In this and\r\nthe corresponding monologue at the end he clearly follows Spenser's\r\narrangement and likewise adopts his minor key--\r\n\r\n    Fayre Philomel, night-musicke of the spring,\r\n      Sweetly recordes her tunefull harmony,\r\n    And with deepe sobbes, and dolefull sorrowing,\r\n      Before fayre Cinthya actes her Tragedy.\r\n\r\nIn Eclogue II a 'wise' shepherd warns a youth against love, and draws a\r\nsomewhat gruesome picture of human fate--\r\n\r\n    And when the bell is readie to be tol'd\r\n      To call the wormes to thine Anatomie,\r\n      Remember then, my boy, what once I said to thee!\r\n\r\nEven this, however, fails to shake the lover's faith in the gentle\r\npassion, and his enthusiasm finds vent in an apostrophe borrowed from\r\nSpenser:\r\n\r\n    Oh divine love, which so aloft canst raise,\r\n      And lift the minde out of this earthly mire.\r\n\r\nThe next eclogue, containing a panegyric on Elizabeth under the name of\r\nBeta, is closely modelled on the 'April,' and abounds with such\r\nreminiscences as the following:\r\n\r\n    Make her a goodly Chapilet of azur'd Colombine,\r\n    And wreath about her Coronet with sweetest Eglantine:\r\n      Bedeck our Beta all with Lillies,\r\n      And the dayntie Daffadillies,\r\n    With Roses damask, white, and red, and fairest flower delice,\r\n    With Cowslips of Jerusalem, and cloves of Paradice.\r\n\r\nHere, however, Drayton shows himself more skilful in dealing with a\r\nlyrical stanza than most of his fellow imitators. In the fourth eclogue\r\ntwo shepherds sing a dirge made by Rowland on the death of Elphin, that is\r\nSidney. In the next Rowland himself sings the praises of Idea; and in the\r\nsixth Perkin those of Pandora, doubtless the Countess of Pembroke. The\r\nseventh is a singularly unentertaining dispute, in which typical\r\nrepresentatives of age and youth abuse one another by turns; the eighth is\r\na description of the golden age, a theme Spenser had omitted; and lastly,\r\nin the ninth we return to the opening love-motive, this time, as in the\r\n_Calender_, amid the frosts of winter.\r\n\r\nThese eclogues were reprinted in a different order in the 'Poems Lyric and\r\nPastoral' (_c._ 1606) with one additional poem there numbered the ninth.\r\nThis describes a rustic gathering of shepherds and nymphs, and contains\r\nseveral songs. The verse exhibits no small advance on the earlier work,\r\nand one song at least is in the author's daintiest manner. He seldom\r\nsurpassed the graceful conceit of the lines:\r\n\r\n    Through yonder vale as I did passe,\r\n      Descending from the hill,\r\n    I met a smerking bony lasse;\r\n      They call her Daffadill:\r\n\r\n    Whose presence as along she went,\r\n      The prety flowers did greet,\r\n    As though their heads they downward bent\r\n      With homage to her feete.\r\n\r\nSpenser, in spite of the warning he addressed to his book--\r\n\r\n    Dare not to match thy pype with Tityrus his style,\r\n    Nor with the Pilgrim that the Ploughman playde awhyle--\r\n\r\ncould nevertheless assert in semi-burlesque rime:\r\n\r\n    It shall continewe till the worlds dissolution;\r\n\r\nand his disciple is not to be outdone. Never was truer lover or sweeter\r\nsinger--\r\n\r\n    Oenon never upon Ida hill\r\n      So oft hath cald on Alexanders name,\r\n    As hath poore Rowland with an Angels quill\r\n      Erected trophies of Ideas fame:\r\n    Yet that false shepheard, Oenon, fled from thee;\r\n    I follow her that ever flies from me.\r\n\r\nThus Drayton endeavoured to follow in the footsteps of a greater than he,\r\nand small success befell him in his uncongenial task. He knew little and\r\ncared less about the moral and philosophical rags that clung yet about the\r\npastoral tradition. He sang, in his lighter vein at least, for the mere\r\npleasure that his song could afford to himself and others: the Spenserian\r\nand traditional garb fits him ill. His golden age is rather amorous than\r\nphilosophical; he is more concerned that love should be free and true than\r\nthat the earth should yield her fruits unwounded of the plough; and even\r\nso he hastens away from that colourless age to troll the delightful ballad\r\nof Dowsabel. The inspiration for this he found, not in Spenser and his\r\nlearned predecessors, but in the popular romances, and in it we hear for\r\nthe first time the voice of the real Michael Drayton, the accredited bard\r\nto the court of Faery. So again in the barren dispute of the seventh\r\neclogue, he turns aside from his theme as the shadow of the winged god\r\nflits across his path--\r\n\r\n    That pretie Cupid, little god of love,\r\n      Whose imped winges with speckled plumes been dight,\r\n    Who striketh men below and Gods above,\r\n      Roving at randon with his feathered flight,\r\n    When lovely Venus sits and gives the ayme,\r\n    And smiles to see her little Bantlings game.\r\n\r\nIf these eclogues formed Drayton's only claim upon our attention as a\r\npastoral poet there would be no excuse for lingering over him. He left\r\nother work, however, which, if but slightly pastoral in subject, is at\r\nleast thoroughly so in form and spirit. The _Muses Elizium_ did not appear\r\ntill 1630, and it is consequently not a little premature to speak of it in\r\nthis place. It is, however, so important as illustrating the freer and\r\nmore spontaneous vein traceable in many English pastoralists from Henryson\r\nonwards, that it is worth while to place it for comparison side by side\r\nwith the more orthodox tradition as exemplified, in spite of his\r\noriginality, in the work of Spenser.\r\n\r\nThe _Muses Elizium_ is in truth the culmination of a long sequence of\r\npastoral work. Of this I have already discussed the beginnings when\r\ndealing with the native pastoral impulse; and however much it was\r\ninfluenced at a later date by foreign models it never submitted to the\r\nyoke of orthodox tradition, and to the end retained much of its freshness.\r\nThe early anthologies are full of this sort of verse, the song-books are\r\nfull of it, and so are the romances and the plays. To this lyrical\r\ntradition belong Breton's songs, of which one has already been quoted;\r\nthere was hardly a poet of note at the end of the sixteenth century who\r\ndid not contribute his quota. We find it once more, intermingling with a\r\ncertain formal strain, in Drayton's _Shepherds' Sirena_ containing the\r\ndelightful song, with its subtle interchange of dactylic and iambic\r\nrhythms, so admirably characteristic of the author of the _Agincourt_\r\nballad:\r\n\r\n    Neare to the Silver Trent\r\n      Sirena dwelleth,\r\n    Shee to whom Nature lent\r\n      All that excelleth;\r\n    By which the Muses late\r\n      And the neate Graces,\r\n    Have for their greater state\r\n      Taken their places:\r\n    Twisting an Anadem\r\n      Wherewith to Crowne her,\r\n    As it belong'd to them\r\n      Most to renowne her.\r\n        On thy Bancke,\r\n          In a Rancke\r\n            Let thy Swanes sing her\r\n        And with their Musick\r\n            along let them bring her.\r\n\r\nIn this pervading impulse of pure and spontaneous pastoral the soul of\r\nwhat is sweet and winning in things common and familiar as our household\r\nfairies blends with the fresh glamour of early love and the dainty\r\ndelights of an ideal world, where despair is only less sweet than\r\nfruition, and love only less divine than chastity, where, as Drayton\r\nfrankly tells us,\r\n\r\n    The winter here a Summer is,\r\n      No waste is made by time,\r\n    Nor doth the Autumne ever misse\r\n      The blossomes of the Prime;\r\n\r\n    The flower that July forth doth bring,\r\n      In Aprill here is seene,\r\n    The Primrose, that puts on the Spring,\r\n      In July decks each Greene,\r\n\r\na world, in short, in which the nymphs may strew the laureate hearse, not\r\nonly with all the flowers and fruits of earth, but with the Amaranth of\r\nparadise and the stars of heaven if the fancy takes them. Of a spirit\r\ncompounded of these elements and of its quintessence are the 'Nymphals' of\r\nthe _Muses Elizium_. There are portions of the work, it is true, in which\r\nthe more vulgar strains of the conventional pastoral make themselves\r\nheard, as in the satires of the fourth and tenth Nymphals; but for the\r\nmost part we are allowed to wander undisturbed among the woods and\r\npastures of an earthly paradise, and revel in the fairy laureate's most\r\nimaginative work. There we meet Lirope, of whom\r\n\r\n    Some said a God did her beget,\r\n      But much deceiv'd were they,\r\n    Her Father was a Rivelet,\r\n      Her Mother was a Fay.\r\n    Her Lineaments so fine that were\r\n      She from the Fayrie tooke,\r\n    Her Beauties and Complection cleere\r\n      By nature from the Brooke.\r\n\r\nThere Naiis sings, roguishly enough, in the martial metre of _Agincourt_:\r\n\r\n    'Cloe, I scorne my Rime\r\n    Should observe feet or time,\r\n    Now I fall, then I clime,\r\n      What is't I dare not?'\r\n\r\n    'Give thy Invention wing,\r\n      And let her flert and fling,\r\n    Till downe the Rocks she ding,\r\n      For that I care not';\r\n\r\nthe song then breaking off into gamesome anapaests:\r\n\r\n    The gentle winds sally\r\n    Upon every Valley,\r\n    And many times dally\r\n      And wantonly sport,\r\n    About the fields tracing,\r\n    Each other in chasing,\r\n    And often imbracing,\r\n      In amorous sort.\r\n\r\nThere, again, we listen to the litany of the Muses, with the response:\r\n\r\n    Sweet Muse, perswade our Phoebus to inspire\r\n    Us for his Altars with his holiest fire,\r\n    And let his glorious, ever-shining Rayes\r\n    Give life and growth to our Elizian Bayes;\r\n\r\nor else hear the fairy prothalamium, most irrepressible and inimitable of\r\nbridal songs--\r\n\r\n    For our Tita is this day\r\n    Married to a noble Fay.\r\n\r\nThere, lastly, we behold the flutter of tender breasts half veiled when\r\nVenus and her wayward archer are abroad, and listen as fair Lelipa reads\r\nthe decree:\r\n\r\n    To all th' Elizian Nimphish Nation,\r\n    Thus we make our Proclamation\r\n    Against Venus and her Sonne,\r\n    For the mischeefe they have done:\r\n    After the next last of May,\r\n    The fixt and peremptory day,\r\n    If she or Cupid shall be found\r\n    Upon our Elizian ground,\r\n    Our Edict mere Rogues shall make them,\r\n    And as such, who ere shall take them,\r\n    Them shall into prison put;\r\n    Cupids wings shall then be cut,\r\n    His Bow broken, and his Arrowes\r\n    Given to Boyes to shoot at Sparrowes;\r\n    And this Vagabond be sent,\r\n    Having had due punishment,\r\n    To mount Cytheron, which first fed him,\r\n    Where his wanton Mother bred him,\r\n    And there, out of her protection,\r\n    Dayly to receive correction.\r\n    Then her Pasport shall be made,\r\n    And to Cyprus Isle convayd,\r\n    And at Paphos, in her Shryne,\r\n    Where she hath beene held divine,\r\n    For her offences found contrite,\r\n    There to live an Anchorite.\r\n\r\nWe have here the very essence of whatever most delicately and quaintly\r\nexquisite the half sincere and half playful ideal of pastoral had\r\ngenerated since the days of Moschus.\r\n\r\nHow is it then, we may pause a moment to inquire, that in spite of its\r\ncrudities of language and even of metre, in spite of its threadbare themes\r\nbut half repatched with homelier cloth, in spite of its tedious\r\ntheological controversies, its more or less conventional loves and more or\r\nless exaggerated panegyrics--how is it that in spite of all this we still\r\nregard the _Shepherd's Calender_ as serious literature; while with all its\r\nexquisite justness, as of ivory carved and tinted by the hand of a master\r\nand encrusted with the sparkle of a thousand gems, the _Muses' Elizium_\r\nremains a toy? It is not merely the prestige of the author's name: it is\r\nnot merely that we tend to accept the work of each at his own valuation.\r\nWe have to seek the explanation of the phenomenon in the fact that not\r\nonly has the _Shepherd's Calender_ behind it a vast tradition, reverend if\r\nsomewhat otiose--the devotion of men counts for something--but also that,\r\nhowever stiffly laced in an unsuitable garb, it sought to deal with\r\nmatters of real import to man, or at any rate with what man has held as\r\nsuch. It treated questions of religious policy which touched the majority\r\nof men more nearly then than now; with moral problems calculated to\r\ninterest the mind of an age still tinged with medievalism; with\r\nphilosophical theories of human and divine love. In other words, the\r\n_Shepherd's Calender_ lay in the main stream of literature, and reflected\r\nthe mind of the age, while the _Muses' Elizium_, in common with so much\r\npastoral work, did not. These considerations open up an interesting field\r\nof speculation. Are we to suppose that there is indeed a line of\r\ndemarcation between great art and little art wholly independent of that\r\nwhich divides good art from bad art? Are we to go further, and assume that\r\nthese two lines of division intersect, so that a work may be akin to\r\ngreat art though it be not good art, while, however perfect a work of art\r\nmay be, it may remain little art for some wholly non-aesthetic reason? But\r\nwe digress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient, in dealing with the considerable volume of English\r\npastoral verse which has come down to us from the late sixteenth and early\r\nseventeenth centuries, to divide it into two portions, according as it\r\ntends to attach itself to orthodox foreign tradition on the one hand, or\r\nto the more spontaneous native type on the other. To the former division\r\nbelong in the main the more ambitious set pieces and eclogue-cycles, to\r\nthe latter the lighter and more occasional verse, the pastoral ballads and\r\nthe lyrics. The division is necessarily somewhat arbitrary, for the two\r\ntraditions act and react on one another incessantly, and the types merge\r\nalmost imperceptibly the one into the other; but that does not prevent the\r\nspirit that manifests itself in Drayton's eclogues being essentially\r\ndifferent from that which produced Breton's songs. I shall not, however,\r\ntry to draw any hard and fast line between the two, but shall rather deal\r\nfirst with those writers whose most important work inclines to the more\r\nformal tradition, and shall then endeavour to give some account of the\r\nlighter pastoral verse of the time.\r\n\r\nAfter the appearance of the _Shepherd's Calender_ some years elapsed\r\nbefore English poetry again ventured upon the domain of pastoral, at least\r\nin any serious composition. In 1589, however, appeared a small quarto\r\nvolume, with the title: 'An Eglogue. Gratulatorie. Entituled: To the right\r\nhonorable, and renowmed Shepheard of Albions Arcadia: Robert Earle of\r\nEssex and Ewe, for his welcome into England from Portugall. Done by George\r\nPeele. Maister of arts in Oxon.' Like the 'A. W.' of the _Rhapsody_, Peele\r\nfollowed Spenser more closely than most of his fellow imitators in the use\r\nof dialect, but his eclogue on the not particularly glorious return of\r\nEssex has little interest. His importance as a pastoralist lies elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe following year the poet of the _Hecatompathia_, Thomas Watson, a\r\npastoralist of note according to the critics of his own age, but whose\r\nwork in this line is chiefly Latin, published his 'Ecloga in Obitum\r\nHonoratissimi Viri, Domini Francisci Walsinghami, Equitis aurati, Divae\r\nElizabethae a secretis, & sanctioribus consiliis,' entitled _Meliboeus_,\r\nand also in the same year a translation of the piece into English. The\r\nlatter is considerably shorter than the original, but still of tedious\r\nlength. The usual transition from the dirge to the paean is managed with\r\nmore than the usual lack of effect. The eclogue contains a good deal\r\nbeyond its immediate subject; for instance, a lament for Astrophel, a\r\npassage in praise of Spenser, and a panegyric on\r\n\r\n    Diana, matchless Queene of Arcadie--\r\n\r\nall subjects hardly possible for a poet to escape, writing _more\r\npastorali_ in 1590. Watson also left several other pastoral compositions\r\nin the learned tongue, which, from their eponymous hero, won for him the\r\nshepherd-name of Amyntas. Thus in 1585 he published a work in Latin\r\nhexameter verse with the title 'Amyntas Thomae Watsoni Londinensis I. V.\r\nstudiosi,' divided into eleven 'Querelae,' which was 'paraphrastically\r\ntranslated' by Abraham Fraunce into English hexameters, and published\r\nunder the title 'The Lamentations of Amyntas for the death of Phillis' in\r\n1587. This translation, 'somewhat altered' to serve as a sequel to an\r\nEnglish hexametrical version of Tasso's _Aminta_, was republished in 'The\r\nCountesse of Pembrokes Ivychurch' of 1591. Again in 1592 Watson produced\r\nanother work entitled _Amintae Gaudia_, part of which was translated under\r\nthe title _An Old-fashioned Love_, and published as by I. T. in 1594.[111]\r\n\r\nNext in order--passing over Drayton, with whom we have been already\r\nsufficiently concerned--is a writer who, without the advantage of original\r\ngenius or brilliant imagination, succeeded by mere charm of poetic style\r\nand love of natural beauty, in lifting his work above the barren level of\r\ncontemporary pastoral verse. Richard Barnfield's _Affectionate Shepherd_,\r\nimitated, as he frankly confesses, from Vergil's _Alexis_, appeared in\r\n1594. Appended to it was a poem similar in tone and spirit, entitled _The\r\nShepherd's Content_, containing a description of country life and scenery,\r\ntogether with a lamentation for Sidney, a hymn to love, a praise of the\r\npoets, and other similar matters. The easy if somewhat monotonous grace\r\nwhich pervades both these pieces is seen to better advantage in the\r\ndelightful _Shepherd's Ode_, which appeared in his _Cynthia_ of 1595, and\r\nbegins:\r\n\r\n    Nights were short and days were long,\r\n    Blossoms on the hawthorn hong,\r\n    Philomel, night-music's king,\r\n    Told the coming of the spring;\r\n\r\nor in the yet more perfect song:\r\n\r\n    As it fell upon a day\r\n    In the merry month of May,\r\n    Sitting in a pleasant shade\r\n    Which a group of myrtles made,\r\n    Beasts did leap and birds did sing,\r\n    Trees did grow and plants did spring,\r\n    Everything did banish moan,\r\n    Save the nightingale alone;\r\n    She, poor bird, as all forlorn,\r\n    Lean'd her breast against a thorn,\r\n    And there sung the dolefull'st ditty,\r\n    That to hear it was great pity....\r\n    Ah, thought I, thou mourn'st in vain,\r\n    None takes pity on thy pain.\r\n    Senseless trees, they cannot hear thee;\r\n    Ruthless beasts, they will not cheer thee;\r\n    King Pandion he is dead,\r\n    All thy friends are lapp'd in lead[112];\r\n    All thy fellow birds do sing,\r\n    Careless of thy sorrowing;\r\n    Even so, poor bird, like thee,\r\n    None alive will pity me[113].\r\n\r\nNo particular interest attaches to the four eclogues included in Thomas\r\nLodge's _Fig for Momus_, published in 1595, but they serve to throw light\r\non a kind of pastoral freemasonry that was springing up at this period.\r\nSpenser and Sidney, under the names of Colin and Astrophel, or more rarely\r\nPhilisides, were firmly fixed in poetic tradition; Barnfield, by coupling\r\nthem with these, made Watson and Drayton free of the craft in his\r\ncomplaint to Love in the _Shepherd's Content_:\r\n\r\n    By thee great Collin lost his libertie,\r\n      By thee sweet Astrophel forwent his joy,\r\n    By thee Amyntas wept incessantly,\r\n      By thee good Rowland liv'd in great annoy.\r\n\r\nNow we find Lodge dedicating his four eclogues respectively to Colin,\r\nMenalcus, Rowland, and Daniel. Who Menalcus was is uncertain; not, it\r\nwould seem, a poet. The themes are serious, even weighty according to the\r\nestimation of the author, and befit the mood of the poet who first sought\r\nto acclimatize the classical satire[114]. These eclogues do not, however,\r\ntestify to any high poetic gift, any more than do the couple in a lighter\r\nvein found in the _Phillis_ of 1593. Lodge was happier in the lyric verses\r\nwith which he strewed his romances--such for instance as the lines to\r\nPhoebe in _Rosalynde_, though these did certainly lay themselves open to\r\nparody[115]. In the same romance Lodge rose for once to a perfection of\r\ndelicate conceit unsurpassed from his day to ours:\r\n\r\n    Love in my bosom like a bee\r\n      Doth suck his sweet;\r\n    Now with his wings he plays with me,\r\n      Now with his feet.\r\n\r\n    Within mine eyes he makes his nest,\r\n    His bed amidst my tender breast;\r\n    My kisses are his daily feast,\r\n    And yet he robs me of my rest.\r\n      Ah, wanton, will ye?\r\n\r\nThe year 1595 also saw the publication of Francis Sabie's _Pan's Pipe_,\r\nwhich contains, according to the not wholly accurate title-page, 'Three\r\nPastorall Eglogues, in English Hexameter.' These constituted the first\r\nattempt in English at writing original eclogues in Vergilian metre, and\r\nthe injudicious experiment has not, I believe, been repeated. The subjects\r\npresent little novelty of theme, but the treatment illustrates the natural\r\ntendency of English pastoral writers towards narrative and the influence\r\nof the romantic ballad motives. The same volume contains another work of\r\nSabie's, namely, the _Fishermaris Tale_, a blank-verse rendering of\r\nGreene's _Pandosto_[116].\r\n\r\nThe three pastoral elegies of William Basse, published in 1602, the last\r\nwork of the kind to appear in Elizabeth's reign, form in reality a short\r\npastoral romance. The court-bred Anander falls in love with the\r\nshepherdess Muridella, and charges the sheep-boy Anetor to convey to her\r\nthe knowledge of his passion. His love proving unkind he turns shepherd,\r\nand resolves to remain so until his suit obtains better grace. More than\r\nhalf a century later, namely in 1653, Basse prepared for press a\r\nmanuscript containing a series of pastorals headed 'Clio, or The first\r\nMuse in 9 Eglogues in honor of 9 vertues,' and arranged according to the\r\ndays of the week. The whole composition is singularly lacking alike in\r\ninterest and merit.[117]\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising to find the eclogues of the early years of James'\r\nreign reflecting current events. In 1603 appeared a curious compilation,\r\nthe work of Henry Chettle, bearing the title: 'Englandes Mourning Garment:\r\nWorne here by plaine Shepheardes; in memorie of their sacred Mistresse,\r\nElizabeth, Queene of Vertue while shee lived, and Theame of Sorrow, being\r\ndead. To which is added the true manner of her Emperiall Funerall. After\r\nwhich foloweth the Shepheards Spring-Song, for entertainement of King\r\nJames our most potent Soveraigne. Dedicated to all that loved the deceased\r\nQueene, and honor the living King.' The book is a strange medley of verse\r\nand prose, elegies on Elizabeth in the form of eclogues, and political\r\nlectures written in the style of the pastoral romance. The most\r\ninteresting passage is an address to contemporary poets reproaching them\r\nfor their neglect of the praises of the late queen. The pastoral names\r\nunder which they are introduced appear to be merely nonce appellations,\r\nbut are worth recording as they refer to a set outside the usual pastoral\r\ncircle. Thus Corin is Chapman; Musaeus, of course Marlowe; English Horace,\r\nno doubt Jonson; Melicert, Shakespeare; Coridon, Drayton; Anti-Horace,\r\nmost likely Dekker, and Moelibee, mentioned with him, possibly Marston. To\r\nMusidore, 'Hewres last Musaeus' (no doubt corrupt), and the 'infant muse,'\r\nit is more difficult to assign an identity.[118] Throughout Chettle\r\nassumes to himself Spenser's pastoral title.\r\n\r\nTo the same or the following year belong the twelve eclogues by Edward\r\nFairfax, the translater of Tasso's _Gerusalemme_, which are now for the\r\nmost part lost. One, the fourth, was printed in 1737 from the original\r\nmanuscript, another in 1883 from a later transcript in the Bodleian, while\r\na third is preserved in a fragmentary state in the British Museum.[119]\r\nAll three deal chiefly with contemporary affairs, the two former being\r\nconcerned with the abuses of the church, while the last is a panegyric of\r\nthe 'present age,' and especially of English maritime adventure. This is\r\ncertainly the most pleasing of the three, though the style is at times\r\npretentious and over-charged with far-fetched allusions. There are,\r\nhowever, fine passages, as for instance the lines on Drake:\r\n\r\n    And yet some say that from the Ocean maine,\r\n    He will returne when Arthur comes againe.\r\n\r\nMore directly concerned with the political events of the day is the\r\ncurious eclogue Δάφνις Πολυστέφανος by Sir George Buc, published in 1605,\r\nin praise of the Genest crown, the royal right by Apollo's divine decree\r\nof a long line of English kings, who are passed in review by way of\r\nintroduction to the praises of their latest representative. The work was\r\nrevised by an unknown hand for the accession of Charles, and republished\r\nunder the title of _The Great Plantagenet_ in 1635, as by 'Geo. Buck,\r\nGent.' Sir George held the post of Master of the Revels from 1608 to 1622,\r\nand died the following year.\r\n\r\nIn 1607 appeared a poem 'Mirrha the Mother of Adonis,' by William\r\nBarksted, to which were appended three eclogues by Lewes Machin.[120] Of\r\nthese, one describes the love of a shepherd and his nymph, while the other\r\ntwo treat the theme of Apollo and Hyacinth. Composed in easy verse of no\r\nparticular distinction these poems belong to that borderland between the\r\nidyllic and the salacious on which certain shepherd-poets loved to dally.\r\n\r\nThe years 1614 and 1615 saw the appearance of works of considerably\r\ngreater interest from every point of view, among others from that of what\r\nI have described as pastoral freemasonry. In the former year there\r\nappeared a small octavo volume entitled _The Shepherd's Pipe_. The chief\r\ncontributor was William Browne of Tavistock, the first book of whose\r\npastoral epic, _Britannia's Pastorals_, had appeared the previous year.\r\nBesides seven eclogues from his pen, the volume contained one by\r\nChristopher Brooke, one by Sir John Davies, and two by George Wither.\r\nThese last two were republished in 1615, with three additional pieces, in\r\nWither's collection entitled _The Shepherd's Hunting_. With the exception\r\nof one or two of Browne's, these fourteen eclogues all deal with the\r\npersonal relation of the friends who disguise themselves respectively,\r\nBrowne as Willy, Wither as Roget (a name later exchanged for that of\r\nPhilarete), Brooke as Cuddie, and Davies as Wernock. Wither's were\r\nwritten, as we learn from the title-page of the 1615 volume, while the\r\nauthor was in prison in the Marshalsea for hunting vice with a pack of\r\nsatires in full cry, that is, the _Abuses Stript and Whipt_ of 1611. The\r\nverse seldom rises above an amiable mediocrity, the best that can be said\r\nfor it being that it carries on, in a not wholly unworthy manner, the\r\ndainty tradition of the octosyllabic couplet between the _Faithful\r\nShepherdess_ and Milton's early poems. Browne's eclogues are chiefly\r\nremarkable for the introduction into the first of a long and rather\r\ntedious tale derived from a manuscript of Thomas Occleve's. The last of\r\nthe series, an elegy on the death of Thomas, son of Sir Peter Manwood, has\r\nbeen quoted as the model of _Lycidas_, but the resemblance begins and ends\r\nwith the fact that in either case the subject of the poem met his death by\r\ndrowning--a resemblance which will scarcely support a charge of\r\nplagiarism[121].\r\n\r\nIn 1621 appeared six eclogues under the title of _The Shepherd's Tales_ by\r\nthe prolific miscellaneous writer Richard Brathwaite. Each in its turn\r\nrecounts the amorous misfortunes of some swain, which usually arise out of\r\nthe inconstancy of his sweetheart, and the prize of infelicity having been\r\nadjudged, the author, not perhaps without a touch of malice, sends the\r\nwhole company off to a wedding. The _Tales_ are noteworthy for the very\r\npronounced dramatic gift they reveal, being in this respect quite unique\r\nin their kind. The same year saw the publication of the not very\r\nsuccessful expansion of one of these eclogues into the pastoral narrative\r\nin verse, entitled 'Omphale or the Inconstant Shepherdesse.' Brathwaite\r\nhad already in 1614 published the _Poet's Willow_, containing a\r\n'Pastorall' which recounts the unsuccessful love of Berillus, an Arcadian\r\nshepherd, for the nymph Eliza[122].\r\n\r\nPursuing the chronological order we come next to Phineas Fletcher's\r\n'Piscatorie Eclogs' appended to his _Purple Island_ in 1633. Except that\r\nthe scene is laid on the banks of a river instead of in the pastures, and\r\nthat the characters spend their time looking after boats and nets instead\r\nof tending flocks, they differ in nought from the strictly pastoral\r\ncompositions. They are seven in number, and deal either with personal\r\nsubjects or with conventional themes. As an imitation of the _Shepherd's\r\nCalender_, without its uncouthness whether of subject or language, and\r\nequally without its originality or higher poetic value, the work is not\r\nwanting in merit, but it is most decidedly wanting in all power to arrest\r\nthe reader's attention.\r\n\r\nThe last collection that will claim our notice is that of Francis Quarles,\r\nwhich appeared posthumously in 1646 under the title of 'The Shepheards\r\nOracles: Delivered in Certain Eglogues[123]. The interest of the volume\r\nlies not so much in its poetic merit, which however is considerable, as in\r\nthe fact that it deals with almost every form of religious controversy at\r\na critical point in English history. Quarles was a stanch Anglican, and he\r\nlashes Romanists and Precisians with impartial severity. One of the\r\neclogues opens with a panegyric on Gustavus Adolphus, in the midst of\r\nwhich a messenger enters bearing the news of his death, thus fixing the\r\ndate of the poem in all probability in the winter of 1632-3. In the\r\neleventh and last the Puritan party is mercilessly satirized in the person\r\nof Anarchus, in allusion to the supposed socialistic tendency of its\r\nteaching. He is thus described in a dialogue between Philarchus and\r\nPhilorthus (the lovers of order and justice presumably):\r\n\r\n    _Philor._ How like a Meteor made of zeal and flame\r\n    The man appears!\r\n\r\n    _Philar._    Or like a blazing Star\r\n    Portending change of State, or some sad War,\r\n    Or death of some good Prince.\r\n\r\n    _Philor._         He is the trouble\r\n    Of three sad Kingdoms.\r\n\r\n    _Philar._       Even the very Bubble,\r\n    The froth of troubled waters.\r\n\r\n    _Philor._       Hee's a Page\r\n    Fill'd with Errata's of the present Age.\r\n\r\n    _Philar._ The Churches Scourge--\r\n\r\n    _Philor._           The devils _Enchiridion_--\r\n\r\n    _Philar._ The Squib, the _Ignis fatuus_ of Religion.\r\n\r\nTo their address Anarchus replies in a song which it would be easy to\r\nillustrate from the dramatic literature of the time, and which well\r\nindicates the estimation in which the faction was popularly held. Here is\r\none verse:\r\n\r\n    Wee'l down with all the Varsities,\r\n      Where Learning is profest,\r\n    Because they practise and maintain\r\n      The Language of the Beast:\r\n    Wee'l drive the Doctors out of doores,\r\n      And Arts what ere they be,\r\n    Wee'l cry both Arts, and Learning down,\r\n      And, hey! then up goe we.\r\n\r\nThe whole song for sheer rollicking hypocrisy is without parallel in the\r\nlanguage. The date of the poem is doubtful, but Quarles lived till 1644,\r\nand after two years of civil strife the terms which the interlocutors in\r\nthe above passage apply to the Puritan party can hardly be regarded as\r\nprophetic.\r\n\r\nBesides the works we have examined above, several others are known to have\r\nexisted, though they are not now traceable. Thus 'The sweete sobbes, and\r\namorous Complaintes of Shepardes and Nymphes in a fancye confusde by An\r\nMunday' was entered on the books of the Stationers' Company on August 19,\r\n1583. Two years earlier, on August 3, 1581, had been entered 'A Shadowe of\r\nSannazar.' Again we know, alike from Wood's _Athenae_ and Meres' _Palladis\r\nTamia_, that Stephen Gosson left works of the kind of which we have now no\r\ntrace; while Puttenham in his _Art of English Poesy_ mentions an eclogue\r\nof his own, addressed to Edward VI, and entitled _Elpine_. Puttenham and\r\nMeres in dealing with pastoral writers also mention one Challener, no\r\ndoubt the Thomas Chaloner who contributed to the _Mirror for Magistrates_,\r\nand Nashe in his preface to _Menaphon_ adds Thomas Atchelow, who may be\r\nplausibly identified with the Thomas Achelly who contributed verses to\r\nWatson's _Hecatompathia_ and various sententious fragments to _England's\r\nParnassus_, among them a not very happy rendering of those lines of\r\nCatullus which might almost be taken as a motto to pastoral poetry as a\r\nwhole:\r\n\r\n    The sun doth set, and brings again the day,\r\n    But when our light is gone, we sleep for aye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to arrange the mass of occasional lyric verse of a pastoral\r\nnature in a manner to facilitate a general survey. We may perhaps divide\r\nit roughly into general groups which possess certain points in common and\r\ncan be treated more or less independently. Little would be gained by\r\nfollowing a strictly chronological order, even were it possible to do so.\r\n\r\nWe occasionally meet with translations, though from the nature of the case\r\nthese, as well as evidences of direct foreign influence, are less\r\nprominent here than in the more formal type of pastoral verse. We have\r\nalready seen that Googe, besides borrowing from Garcilaso's version of a\r\nportion of the _Arcadia_, himself paraphrased passages of the _Diana_ in\r\nhis eclogues, and the latter work also supplied material for the pen of\r\nSir Philip Sidney. His debt consists in translations of two songs from\r\nMontemayor's romance, printed among his miscellaneous poems[124]. About a\r\ndozen translations from the same source appeared in _England's Helicon_,\r\nthe work of Bartholomew Yong. They are for the most part very inferior to\r\nthe general average of the collection, but the opening of one at least is\r\nworth quoting:\r\n\r\n    'Guardami las vaccas,\r\n      Carillo, por tu fé.--\r\n    Besami primero,\r\n      Yo te las guardaré.'\r\n\r\n    I prithee keep my kine for me,\r\n      Carillo, wilt thou? tell.--\r\n    First let me have a kiss of thee,\r\n      And I will keep them well.\r\n\r\nAnother translation is the poem headed 'A Pastorall' in Daniel's _Delia_\r\nof 1592, a rendering of the famous chorus to the first act of Tasso's\r\n_Aminta_.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to original verse, the first group of poets to arrest our\r\nattention is the court circle which gathered round Sir Philip Sidney.\r\nThere is a poem by his sister, the Countess of Pembroke, preserved in\r\nDavison's _Poetical Rhapsody_, and there headed 'A Dialogue between two\r\nShepherds, Thenot and Piers, in Praise of Astrea.' It was composed for the\r\nentertainment of the queen, and was no doubt sung or recited in character.\r\nSuch was likewise the mode of production of Sir Philip's 'Dialogue between\r\ntwo Shepherds, uttered in a pastoral show at Wilton,'[125] which is more\r\nrustic in character. _Astrophel and Stella_ supplies a graceful 'complaint\r\nto his flock' against the cruelty of\r\n\r\n    Stella, fiercest shepherdess,\r\n      Fiercest, but yet fairest ever;\r\n    Stella, whom the heavens still bless,\r\n      Though against me she persever.\r\n      Though I bliss inherit never.\r\n\r\nThe _Poetical Rhapsody_ again preserves two others, the outcome of\r\nSidney's friendship with Greville and Dyer. The first is a song of\r\nwelcome; the second, headed 'Dispraise of a Courtly Life,' ends with the\r\nprayer:\r\n\r\n    Only for my two loves' sake,\r\n    In whose love I pleasure take;\r\n    Only two do me delight\r\n    With the ever-pleasing sight;\r\n    Of all men to thee retaining,\r\n    Grant me with these two remaining.\r\n\r\nOf Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke, the loyal admirer and biographer of\r\nSidney, who desired on his tomb no better passport to posterity than that\r\nhe had been Sir Philip's friend, we have among other works published in\r\n1633 a series of so-called sonnets recording his love for the fair\r\nCaelica. There is a thin veil of pastoralism over the whole, with here and\r\nthere a more definite note as in 'Sonnet' 75, a poem of over two hundred\r\nlines lamenting his lady's cruelty--\r\n\r\n    Shepheardesses, yet marke well\r\n    The Martyrdome of Philocell.\r\n\r\nOf Sir Edward Dyer's works no early edition was published. Such isolated\r\npoems as have survived were collected by Grosart in 1872 from a variety of\r\nsources. If the piece entitled _Cynthia_ is authentic, it gives him a\r\nrespectable place beside Greville among the minor pastoralists of his day.\r\nLastly, in connexion with Sidney we may note a curious poem which appeared\r\nin the first edition of the _Arcadia_ only.[126] It is a 'bantering'\r\neclogue, in which the shepherds Nico and Pas first abuse one another and\r\nthen fall to a comic singing match. It is evidently suggested by the fifth\r\nIdyl of Theocritus, and is a fair specimen of a very uncommon class in\r\nEnglish. Akin to this is the burlesque variety, of which we have already\r\nmet with examples in Lorenzo's _Nencia_ and Pulci's _Beca_, and which is\r\nalmost equally rare with us. A specimen will be found in the not very\r\nsuccessful eclogue in Greene's _Menaphon_. The following is as near as the\r\nauthor was able to approach to Lorenzo's delicately playful tone:\r\n\r\n    Carmela deare, even as the golden ball\r\n    That Venus got, such are thy goodly eyes:\r\n    When cherries juice is jumbled therewithall,\r\n    Thy breath is like the steeme of apple pies.\r\n\r\nIt would, of course, be grossly unfair to judge Robert Greene, the\r\never-sinning and ever-repentant, by the above injudicious experiment. His\r\nlyrical powers appear in a very different light, for instance, in the\r\n'Palmer's Ode' in _Never Too Late_ (1590), one of the most charming of his\r\nmany confessions:\r\n\r\n    As I lay and kept my sheepe,\r\n    Came the God that hateth sleepe,\r\n    Clad in armour all of fire,\r\n    Hand in hand with Queene Desire,\r\n    And with a dart that wounded nie,\r\n    Pearst my heart as I did lie,\r\n    That, when I wooke, I gan sweare\r\n    Phillis beautie palme did beare.\r\n\r\nFrom the same romance I must do Greene the justice of quoting the\r\ndelightful, though but remotely pastoral, song of every loving nymph to her\r\nbashful swain:\r\n\r\n    Sweet Adon, darest not glance thine eye--\r\n      N'oserez-vous, mon bel ami?--\r\n    Upon thy Venus that must die?\r\n      Je vous en prie, pity me:\r\n    N'oserez-vous, mon bel, mon bel--\r\n    N'oserez-vous, mon bel ami?\r\n\r\n    See how sad thy Venus lies--\r\n      N'oserez-vous, mon bel ami?--\r\n    Love in heart and tears in eyes;\r\n      Je vous en prie, pity me:\r\n    N'oserez-vous, mon bel, mon bel--\r\n    N'oserez-vous, mon bel ami?\r\n\r\nIt is hard to refrain from quoting half a dozen other pieces. There is the\r\ncourting of Phillis in _Perimedes the Blacksmith_ (1588), with its purely\r\nidyllic close; or again the famous 'Shepherd's Wife's Song' from the\r\n_Mourning Garment_ (1590):\r\n\r\n    Ah, what is love? It is a pretty thing,\r\n    As sweet unto a shepherd as a king;\r\n       And sweeter too,\r\n    For kings have cares that wait upon a crown,\r\n    And cares can make the sweetest love to frown:\r\n       Ah then, ah then,\r\n    If country loves such sweet desires do gain,\r\n    What lady would not love a shepherd swain?\r\n\r\nNo one not utterly callous to the pathos of human life, or warped by some\r\nethical twist beyond the semblance of a man, has ever been able to pass\r\nunmoved by the figure of Robert Greene. We see him, the poet of all that\r\nis truest and tenderest in human affection, abandoning his young wife and\r\nchild, drawn by the power of some fatal fascination into the whirlpool of\r\nlow life in London, and then, as if inspired by a sudden revelation of\r\nobjective vision, penning the throbbing lines of the forsaken mother's\r\nsong:\r\n\r\n    Weep not, my wanton, smile upon my knee,\r\n    When thou art old there's grief enough for thee.\r\n\r\nWe see him again amid the despair and squalor of his death-bed, warning\r\nhis friends against his own example, and addressing to the wife he had not\r\nseen for years those words endorsed on a bill for ten pounds, words ever\r\nmemorable in the history of English letters: 'Doll, I charge thee by the\r\nlove of our youth, and by my soul's rest, that thou wilt see this man\r\npaid; for if he and his wife had not succoured me I had died in the\r\nstreets.' Such are the scenes of sordid misery which underlie some of the\r\nchoicest of English songs. It is best to return to the surface.\r\n\r\nThe lyric 'sequences' published towards the close of the sixteenth\r\ncentury frequently contain more or less pastoral matter. Barnabe Barnes\r\nappended some poems of this sort to his _Parthenophil and Parthenophe_ (c.\r\n1593), among others a version of Moschus' idyl of runaway love, a theme\r\nwhich had long been a favourite one with pastoral writers. Poliziano's\r\nLatin translation of Moschus[127] was commended by E. K. in his notes to\r\nthe _Shepherd's Calender_, and the same original supplied Tasso with the\r\nsubject of his _Amore fuggitivo_, which served as epilogue to the\r\n_Aminta_. William Smith's _Chloris_ (1596), except for plentiful swearing\r\nby pastoral deities, is less bucolic in spite of its dedication to Colin\r\nClout. The most important of the sequences from our present point of view\r\nis Nicholas Breton's _Passionate Shepherd,_ which was not published till\r\n1604. It contains five pastorals in praise of Aglaia:\r\n\r\n    Had I got a kingly grace,\r\n    I would leave my kingly place\r\n    And in heart be truly glad\r\n    To become a country lad,\r\n    Hard to lie and go full bare,\r\n    And to feed on hungry fare,\r\n    So I might but live to be\r\n    Where I might but sit to see,\r\n    Once a day, or all day long,\r\n    The sweet subject of my song;\r\n    In Aglaia's only eyes\r\n    All my worldly paradise.\r\n\r\nThis is a fair specimen of Breton's dainty muse, but his choicest work\r\nappeared in that wonderful anthology published in 1600 under the title of\r\n_England's Helicon_. To this collection Breton contributed such verses as\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n    On a hill there grows a flower--\r\n      Fair befall the dainty sweet!--\r\n    By that flower there is a bower,\r\n      Where the heavenly muses meet.\r\n\r\n    In that bower there is a chair,\r\n      Fringèd all about with gold;\r\n    Where doth sit the fairest fair,\r\n      That ever eye did yet behold.\r\n\r\n    It is Phyllis fair and bright,\r\n      She that is the shepherd's joy;\r\n    She that Venus did despite,\r\n      And did bind her little boy.\r\n\r\nOr again:\r\n\r\n    Good Muse, rock me asleep\r\n      With some sweet harmony;\r\n    The weary eye is not to keep\r\n      Thy wary company.\r\n\r\n    Sweet Love, begone awhile,\r\n      Thou knowest my heaviness;\r\n    Beauty is born but to beguile\r\n      My heart of happiness.\r\n\r\nAnother poem no less perfect has been already quoted at length. In its own\r\nline, the delicate carving of fair images as in crystal or some precious\r\nstone, Breton's work is unsurpassed. We cannot do better than take, as\r\nexamples of a very large class, some of the poems printed, in most cases\r\nfor the first time, in _England's Helicon_. Of Henry Constable, the poet\r\nindicated doubtless by the initiais H. C., we have a charming song between\r\nPhillis and Amaryllis, the counterpart and imitation of Spenser's\r\n'Bonibell' ballad:\r\n\r\n    _P._ Fie on the sleights that men devise--\r\n      (Heigho, silly sleights!)\r\n    When simple maids they would entice.\r\n      (Maids are young men's chief delights.)\r\n    _A._ Nay, women they witch with their eyes--\r\n      (Eyes like beams of burning sun!)\r\n    And men once caught they do despise;\r\n      So are shepherds oft undone.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _P._ If every maid were like to me--\r\n      (Heigho, hard of heart!)\r\n    Both love and lovers scorn'd should be.\r\n      (Scorners shall be sure of smart.)\r\n    _A._ If every maid were of my mind--\r\n      (Heigho, heigho, lovely sweet!)\r\n    They to their lovers should prove kind;\r\n      Kindness is for maidens meet[128].\r\n\r\nOf Sir John Wotton, the short-lived half-brother of the more famous Sir\r\nHenry, there is a spirited song, betraying unusual command over a\r\ncomplicated rhythm:\r\n\r\n    Jolly shepherd, shepherd on a hill,\r\n        On a hill so merrily,\r\n        On a hill so cheerily,\r\n    Fear not, shepherd, there to pipe thy fill;\r\n      Fill every dale, fill every plain;\r\n      Both sing and say, 'Love feels no pain.'\r\n\r\nAnother graceful poet of _England's Helicon_ is the 'Shepherd Tony,' whose\r\nidentity with Anthony Munday was finally established by Mr. Bullen. He\r\ncontributed, among other verses, a not very interesting reply to Harpelus'\r\ncomplaint in 'Tottel's Miscellany,' and the well-known and exquisite:\r\n\r\n    Beauty sat bathing by a spring\r\n      Where fairest shades did hide her,\r\n\r\nwhich reappears in his translation of the Castilian romance _Primelion_.\r\n\r\nIn Marlowe's 'Passionate Shepherd to his Love,' of which _England's\r\nHelicon_ supplies one of three texts[129], we come to what is, with the\r\npossible exception of _Lycidas_ alone, the most subtly modulated specimen\r\nof pastoral verse in English. So far as internal evidence is concerned the\r\npoem has absolutely nothing but its own perfection to connect it with the\r\nname of Marlowe; it is utterly unlike all other verse, dramatic,\r\nnarrative, or lyric, ascribed to him. An admirable eclectic text, which\r\nexhibits to the full the delicacy of the rhythm, has been prepared by Mr.\r\nBullen in his edition of Marlowe's works. It would be impossible not to\r\nquote the piece in full:\r\n\r\n    Come live with me and be my love,\r\n    And we will all the pleasures prove\r\n    That hills and vallies, dales and fields,\r\n    Woods or steepy mountain yields.\r\n\r\n    And we will sit upon the rocks,\r\n    Seeing the shepherds feed their flocks\r\n    By shallow rivers to whose falls\r\n    Melodious birds sing madrigals.\r\n\r\n    And I will make thee beds of roses\r\n    And a thousand fragrant posies,\r\n    A cap of flowers and a kirtle\r\n    Embroidered all with leaves of myrtle.\r\n\r\n    A gown made of the finest wool\r\n    Which from our pretty lambs we pull;\r\n    Fair-lined[130] slippers for the cold,\r\n    With buckles of the purest gold.\r\n\r\n    A belt of straw and ivy-buds,\r\n    With coral clasps and amber studs;\r\n    And if these pleasures may thee move,\r\n    Come live with me, and be my love.\r\n\r\n    The shepherd-swains shall dance and sing\r\n    For thy delight each May-morning:\r\n    If these delights thy mind may move,\r\n    Then live with me, and be my love.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of this poem was testified by its widespread influence on\r\nthe poets of the day. _England's Helicon_ contains 'the Nymphs reply,'\r\ncommonly attributed to Sir Walter Raleigh, and also a long imitation;\r\nDonne wrote a piscatory version, and Herrick paid it the sincerest form of\r\nflattery, while less distinct reminiscences are common in the poetry of\r\nthe time. Yet Kit Marlowe's verses stand unrivalled.\r\n\r\nThe pastoral influence in Shakespeare's verse, both lyric and dramatic, is\r\ntoo obvious to need more than passing notice. Every reader will recall\r\n'Who is Sylvia,' from the _Two Gentlemen_, and 'It was a lover and his\r\nlass,' the song of which, in Touchstone's opinion, 'though there was no\r\ngreat matter in the ditty, yet the tune was very untuneable,' or again the\r\nfamous speech of the chidden king:\r\n\r\n    O God! methinks it were a happy life,\r\n    To be no better than a homely swain;\r\n          (3 _Henry VI_, II. v. 21.)\r\n\r\nand Arthur's exclamation:\r\n\r\n      By my christendom\r\n    So I were out of prison and kept sheep,\r\n    I should be as merry as the day is long.\r\n          (_K. John_, IV. i. 16.)\r\n\r\nOne poem, bearing a certain resemblance to verses of Barnfield's already\r\ndiscussed, may be quoted here. It was originally printed in the fourth\r\nact of _Love's Labour's Lost_ in 1598, reappeared in the _Passionate\r\nPilgrim_ in 1599, and again in _England's Helicon_ in 1600.\r\n\r\n    On a day--alack the day!--\r\n    Love, whose month was ever May,\r\n    Spied a blossom passing fair\r\n    Playing in the wanton air.\r\n    Through the velvet leaves the wind\r\n    All unseen gan passage find,\r\n    That the shepherd, sick to death,\r\n    Wish'd himself the heaven's breath.\r\n    Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow;\r\n    Air, would I might triumph so!\r\n    But, alas, my hand hath sworn\r\n    Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn;\r\n    Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,\r\n    Youth is apt to pluck a sweet.\r\n    [Do not call it sin in me\r\n    That I am forsworn for thee;]\r\n    Thou for whom Jove would swear\r\n    Juno but an Ethiope were,\r\n    And deny himself for Jove,\r\n    Turning mortal for thy love.[131]\r\n\r\nLastly, _England's Helicon_ preserves two otherwise unknown poems of\r\nDrayton's, one probably an early work, having little to recommend it\r\nbeyond the pretty though not original conceit:\r\n\r\n    See where little Cupid lies\r\n    Looking babies in her eyes!\r\n\r\nthe other similar in style to the eclogue first published in the\r\ncollection of c. 1606. About contemporary possibly is the anonymous ballad\r\n'Phillida flouts me,' which in command alike of rhythm and language is\r\nremarkably reminiscent of some, and that some of the best, of Drayton's\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n    Oh, what a plague is love!\r\n      How shall I bear it?\r\n    She will unconstant prove,\r\n      I greatly fear it.\r\n\r\n    It so torments my mind\r\n      That my strength faileth;\r\n    She wavers with the wind,\r\n      As the ship saileth.\r\n    Please her the best you may,\r\n    She looks another way;\r\n    Alas and well-a-day!\r\n      Phillida flouts me[132].\r\n\r\nI have already had occasion to mention the mysterious A. W. in Davison's\r\n_Poetical Rhapsody_, but I cannot refrain from calling attention to one\r\nother poem of his. It is headed 'A fiction, how Cupid made a nymph wound\r\nherself with his arrows,' and is perhaps the nearest thing in English to a\r\nGreek _idyllion_, though in the manner of Moschus rather than of\r\nTheocritus. The opening scene will give an idea of the style:\r\n\r\n    It chanced of late a shepherd's swain,\r\n      That went to seek a strayèd sheep,\r\n    Within a thicket on the plain,\r\n      Espied a dainty nymph asleep.\r\n\r\n    Her golden hair o'erspread her face,\r\n      Her careless arms abroad were cast,\r\n    Her quiver had her pillow's place,\r\n      Her breast lay bare to every blast.\r\n\r\n    The shepherd stood, and gazed his fill;\r\n      Nought durst he do, nought durst he say;\r\n    When chance, or else perhaps his will,\r\n      Did guide the god of love that way.\r\n\r\nAnd so the long pageant troops by, not without its passages of dullness,\r\nits moments of pedestrian gait, for it must be borne in mind that the\r\npoems quoted above are for the most part the choice of what has survived\r\nin a few volumes, and that this in its turn represents the gleanings from\r\na far larger body of verse that once existed. In spite of its perennial\r\nfreshness the charge of want of originality has not unreasonably been\r\nbrought even against the best compositions of the kind. It could hardly be\r\notherwise. Except in the rarest cases originality was impossible. The\r\nimpulse was to write a certain kind of amatory verse, for which the\r\nfashionable medium was pastoral; not to write pastoral for its own sake.\r\nThe demand was for convention, the familiar, the expected; never for\r\noriginality or truth. The fault was in the poetic requirements of the age,\r\nand must not be laid to the charge of those admirable craftsmen who gave\r\nthe age what it wanted; especially when in so doing they enriched English\r\npoetry with some of its choicest gems.\r\n\r\nThe pastoral lyric of the next two reigns is far too wide a subject to be\r\nentered upon here. Grave or gay, satirical or idyllic, coy or wanton,\r\nthere is scarcely a poet of note or obscurity who did not contribute his\r\nshare. Nowhere is a rarer note of pastoral to be found than in\r\n_L'Allegro_, with its\r\n\r\n         every shepherd tells his tale\r\n    Under the hawthorn in the vale.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, saying farewell to this, the lighter side of English\r\npastoral verse, I would call attention to a poem which perhaps more than\r\nany other illustrates the spirit of _voluttà idillica_, characteristic of\r\nso much that possesses abiding value in pastoral. Unfortunately Carew's\r\n_Rapture_ is almost throughout of a nature that forbids reproduction\r\nexcept in a scientific edition, or an admittedly erotic collection. Though\r\nits licence is coterminous with the bounds of natural desire, the candour\r\nof its appeal to unvitiated nature saves it from reproach, and the\r\nperfection of its form makes it an object of never-failing beauty. The\r\nidea with which the poem opens, the escape to a land where all\r\nconventional restrictions cease to have a meaning, was of course suggested\r\nby the first chorus of the _Aminta_:\r\n\r\n              quel vano\r\n    Nome senza soggetto,\r\n    Quell' idolo d' errori, idol d' inganno;\r\n    Quel che dal volgo insano\r\n    Onor poscia fu detto--\r\n    Che di nostra natura 'l feo tiranno.\r\n\r\nI can only extract one short passage out of Tom Carew's poem, that which\r\ndescribes how\r\n\r\n    Daphne hath broke her bark, and that swift foot\r\n    Which th' angry Gods had fast'ned with a root\r\n    To the fix'd earth, doth now unfetter'd run\r\n    To meet th' embraces of the youthful Sun.\r\n    She hangs upon him, like his Delphic Lyre;\r\n    Her kisses blow the old, and breath new, fire;\r\n    Full of her God, she sings inspired lays,\r\n    Sweet odes of love, such as deserve the Bays,\r\n    Which she herself was. Next her, Laura lies\r\n    In Petrarch's learned arms, drying those eyes\r\n    That did in such sweet smooth-paced numbers flow,\r\n    As made the world enamoured of his woe.\r\n\r\nThis is not itself pastoral, but it belongs to that idyllic borderland\r\nwhich we previously noticed in dealing with Italian verse. And again, as\r\nin Italy, so in England, we find the same spirit infusing the mythological\r\ntales. Did time and space allow it would be an interesting diversion to\r\ntrace how the pastoral spirit evinced itself in such works as Peele's\r\n_Tale of Troy_, Lodge's _Scilla's Metamorphosis_, Drayton's _Man in the\r\nMoon_, Brathwaite's _Narcissus Change_ (in the _Golden Fleece_), and found\r\narticulate utterance in the voluptuous cadences of _Venus and Adonis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two specimens of English pastoral verse which I have reserved\r\nfor separate discussion in this place, namely, _Lycidas_ and _Britannia's\r\nPastorals_. The one is probably the most perfect example of the\r\nallegorical pastoral produced since first the form was invented by Vergil,\r\nthe other the longest and most ambitious poem ever composed on a pastoral\r\ntheme.[133]\r\n\r\nMilton's poem was written on the occasion of the death of Edward King,\r\nfellow of Christ's College, who was drowned on his way to Ireland during\r\nthe long vacation of 1637, and first appeared in a collection of memorial\r\nverses by his Cambridge friends published in 1638. It gathers together\r\nwithin its narrow compass as it were whole centuries of pastoral\r\ntradition, fusing them into an organic whole, and inspiring the form with\r\na poetic life of its own.\r\n\r\n    Yet once more, O ye Laurels, and once more\r\n    Ye Myrtles brown, with Ivy never sear,\r\n    I com to pluck your Berries harsh and crude,\r\n    And with forc'd fingers rude,\r\n    Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year.\r\n\r\nFor Lycidas is dead and claims his meed of song.\r\n\r\n    Begin then, Sisters of the sacred well,\r\n    That from beneath the seat of Jove doth spring;\r\n    Begin, and somwhat loudly sweep the string.\r\n\r\nSing first their friendship, nursed upon the self-same hill, their youth\r\nspent together. But oh! the heavy change; now the very caves and woods\r\nmourn his loss. Where then were the Muses, that their loved poet should\r\ndie? And yet what could they do for Lycidas, who had no power to shield\r\nOrpheus himself,\r\n\r\n    When by the rout that made the hideous roar,\r\n    His goary visage down the stream was sent,\r\n    Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore.\r\n\r\nWhat then avails the poet's toil? Were it not better to taste the sweets\r\nof love as they offer themselves since none can count on reward in this\r\nlife? The prize, however, lies elsewhere--\r\n\r\n    Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil.\r\n\r\nBut such thoughts are too lofty for the swains of Arethusa and Mincius.\r\nListen rather as the herald of the sea questions the god of winds about\r\nthe fatal wreck. It was no storm drove the ill-starred boat to\r\ndestruction:\r\n\r\n    The Ayr was calm, and on the level brine,\r\n    Sleek Panope with all her sisters play'd,\r\n\r\nsounds the reply. Next, footing slow, comes the tutelary deity of Alma\r\nMater, and in one sad cry mourns the promise of a life so soon cut short.\r\nLastly, 'The Pilot of the Galilean lake,' with denunciation of the\r\ncorrupt hirelings of a venal age, laments the loss of the church in the\r\ndeath of Lycidas. As his solemn figure passes by, the gracious fantasies\r\nof pastoral landscape shrink away: now\r\n\r\n    Return Alpheus, the dread voice is past,\r\n    That shrunk thy streams,\r\n\r\nbid the nymphs bring flowers of every hue,\r\n\r\n    To strew the Laureat Herse where Lycid lies--\r\n\r\nand yet indeed even this comfort is denied, we dally with false\r\nimaginings,\r\n\r\n      Whilst thee the shores, and sounding Seas\r\n    Wash far away, where ere thy bones are hurld,\r\n    Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides,\r\n    Where thou perhaps under the whelming tide\r\n    Visit'st the bottom of the monstrous world,\r\n\r\nor on the Cornish coast,\r\n\r\n    Where the great vision of the guarded Mount\r\n    Looks toward Namancos and Bayona's hold.\r\n\r\nBut enough!\r\n\r\n    Weep no more, woful Shepherds weep no more,\r\n    For Lycidas your sorrow is not dead,\r\n    Sunk though he be beneath the watry floar,\r\n    So sinks the day-star in the Ocean bed,\r\n    And yet anon repairs his drooping head,\r\n    And tricks his beams, and with new spangled Ore,\r\n    Flames in the forehead of the morning sky.\r\n\r\nOn this note the elegy ends, and there follow eight lines in which the\r\npoet glances at his own pastoral self that has been singing, and realizes\r\nthat the world will go on even though Lycidas be no more, and that there\r\nare other calls in life than that of piping on an oaten reed. These lines\r\ncorrespond to the plain stanzaic frames in which Spenser set his lyrics in\r\nthe _Shepherd's Calender_:\r\n\r\n    Thus sang the uncouth Swain to th' Okes and rills,\r\n    While the still morn went out with Sandals gray,\r\n    He touch'd the tender stops of various Quills,\r\n    With eager thought warbling his Dorick lay:\r\n    And now the Sun had stretch'd out all the hills,\r\n    And now was dropt into the Western bay;\r\n    At last he rose, and twitch'd his Mantle blew:\r\n    To morrow to fresh Woods, and Pastures new.\r\n\r\nThe poem, in common with the whole class of allegorical pastorals, is\r\nundoubtedly open to the charge of artificiality, since, in truth, the\r\npastoral garb can never illustrate, but only distort and obscure subjects\r\ndrawn from other orders of civilization. Yet none but a great master\r\ncould, to produce a desired effect, have utilized every association which\r\ntradition afforded with the consummate skill observable in Milton's poem.\r\nHe has been blamed for the introduction of St. Peter, on the ground of\r\nincongruity; but he has tradition on his side. St. Peter, as we have\r\nalready seen, figures, under the name of Pamphilus, in the eclogues of\r\nPetrarch, and his introduction by Milton is in nicest keeping with the\r\nspirit of the kind. The whole poem, and indeed a great deal more, must\r\nstand or fall with the Pilot of the Galilean Lake, for to censure his\r\nintroduction here is to condemn the whole pastoral tradition of three\r\ncenturies, a judgement which may or may not be just, but which is not a\r\ncriticism on Milton's poem. So again with the flowers that are to be\r\nstrewn on the laureate hearse. Three kinds of berries and eleven kinds of\r\nflowers are mentioned, and it has been pointed out with painful accuracy\r\nthat nine of the latter would have been over, and none of the former ripe\r\non August 11, when King was drowned; while all the flowers, with the\r\nexception of the amaranth, if it were of the true breed, would have been\r\ndead and rotten in November, when the poem was presumably written. It\r\nwould be foolish to quarrel with Milton on this point, since where all is\r\nimaginary such licence is as natural as the strictest botany; yet it must\r\nnot be forgotten that it is just this disseverance from actuality that has\r\nmade the eclogue the type of all that is frigid and artificial in\r\nliterature. The dissatisfaction felt by many with _Lycidas_ was voiced by\r\nDr. Johnson, when he wrote: 'It is not to be considered the effusion of\r\nreal passion, for passion runs not after remote allusions and obscure\r\nopinions.... Where there is leisure for fiction there is little\r\ngrief[134].' This is so absolutely true, with regard to the present poem\r\nat all events, that it would appear hardly worth saying were it not that\r\nthere have always been found persons to maintain the contrary. There is no\r\nreason whatever to suppose that Milton felt any keen personal grief at the\r\ndeath of Edward King. There is nothing spontaneous, nothing, one might\r\nalmost say, genuine in the lament. This is indeed strictly irrelevant to\r\nthe question of its artistic merit, but it must nevertheless be admitted\r\nthat there is thus much justice in the censure, that the poem purports to\r\nbe the expression of an intimate sorrow, of the reality of which the\r\nreader is never wholly convinced. In so far as it lacks this\r\n'soul-compelling power,' it may be said, not unfairly, to fail of its own\r\nartistic purpose.\r\n\r\nOne further question, however, inevitably presents itself when we have to\r\nconsider such a work as _Lycidas_, a work, that is, in which art has\r\nattained the highest perfection in one particular kind. Although the\r\nobjections urged against the individual poem may be shown to miss their\r\nmark as criticisms on that poem, may they not have force as criticisms on\r\nthe class? The allegorical pastoral, though in one sense, as I have said,\r\ncreated by Vergil, was yet, in another, a plant of slow growth, and\r\nrepresents a tradition gradually evolved to meet the needs of a long line\r\nof poets. Petrarch, Mantuan, Marot, Spenser were more than mere imitators\r\nof Vergil or of one another; they wrote in a particular form because it\r\nanswered to particular requirements, and they fashioned it in the using.\r\nNevertheless it may be urged with undoubted force, that the requirements\r\nwere not primarily of an artistic nature, being ever governed by some\r\nalien purpose, and that consequently the form which evolved itself in\r\nanswer to those requirements and to fulfil that purpose, was not by nature\r\ncalculated to yield the highest artistic results. And thus, though any\r\nattempt to question the perfection of the art which Milton brought to the\r\ncomposition of his elegy must needs be foredoomed to failure, the question\r\nof the propriety of the form as an artistic medium remains open; and in so\r\nfar as critical opinion tends to give an unfavourable answer, in so far\r\ndoes the form of pastoral instituted by Vergil and handed down without\r\nbreak from the fourteenth century to Milton's own time stand condemned in\r\nits most perfect flower.\r\n\r\nFew things could be less like _Lycidas_ than the work which next claims\r\nour attention. Unique of its kind, and, in spite of its shortcomings,\r\npossessed of no small poetic interest, William Browne's _Britannia's\r\nPastorals_ may be regarded at pleasure either as a pastoral epic or as a\r\nversified romance. It resembles the prose romances in being by nature\r\ndiscursive, episodic and inconsequent, and like not a few it remained\r\nunfinished. Little would be gained by giving any detailed analysis of the\r\nplot developed through the leisurely amplitude of its 10,000 lines, while\r\nany attempt to deal, however slightly, with the sources and literary\r\nanalogues of the work would lead us far beyond the scope of the present\r\nchapter[135]. With regard to the latter, it must suffice to note that\r\namong the works to which incidents can be directly traced are Tasso's\r\n_Gerusalemme_, Montemayor's _Diana_, and Fletcher's _Faithful\r\nShepherdess_, while a more general indebtedness may in particular be\r\nobserved to Chaucer, _Piers Plowman_, and the _Faery Queen_. The plot\r\ninvolves two more or less connected threads of action, the one dealing\r\nwith the adventures of the swains and shepherdesses, the other concerned\r\nwith the progress of Thetis and her court. This latter recalls the poetic\r\ngeography of Drayton's _Polyolbion_. The principal episodes in the former\r\nare the loves of Celandine and Marina, and the allegorical story of Fida\r\nand Aletheia, each of which leads to numerous ramifications. Indeed, so\r\nfar as the pastoral action is concerned, the whole is one string of barely\r\nconnected episodes.\r\n\r\nCelandine loves the shepherdess Marina, who is readily brought to return\r\nhis affection. To the love thus easily won he soon becomes indifferent,\r\nand Marina in despair seeks to end her sorrows in a stream. Saved by the\r\ngod of the fountain, she is carried off to Mona, and there imprisoned in a\r\ncave by the monster Limos (hunger). With her loss, Celandine's love\r\nrevives, and in his search for her he is led to visit the faery realm,\r\nwhere he finds Spenser lying asleep. The poem ends abruptly in the midst\r\nof his adventures. The story of Fida centres round the slaughter of her\r\npet hind by the monster Riot. From the mangled remains of the animal rises\r\nthe beautiful form of Aletheia (truth). The new-transformed nymph is the\r\ndaughter of Chronos (time), born, Pallas-like, without a mother. The\r\nnarrative of her rejection by the world gives occasion for some biting\r\nsatire on the ill-living of the religious orders, the vanity of the court,\r\nand the dishonesty of the crafts. Meanwhile Riot, who from this point\r\nceases to be an embodiment of cruelty, and comes to typify fallen\r\nhumanity--the _Humanum Genus_ of the moralities--passing successively by\r\nRemembrance, Remorse, and Repentance, is purged of his foul shape, and\r\nappears as the shepherd Amyntas, finally to be united in marriage with\r\nAletheia. With these adventures is interwoven the progress of Thetis, who\r\ncomes to view her dominions. From the Euxine and the Hellespont her train\r\nsweeps on by Adriatic and Atlantic shores, past lands which call up the\r\nnames of a long line of poets--Vergil, Ovid, Ariosto, Petrarch, Tasso, Du\r\nBartas, Marot, Ronsard--till ultimately she arrives off the coast of\r\nDevon--the Devon of Browne and Drake. Here the shepherds assemble to do\r\nher honour, from Colin Clout down to Browne's immediate circle, Brooke,\r\nDavies, and Wither, and here the poet entertains her with the tale of\r\nWalla and Tavy, which forms a charming incidental piece. The nymph Walla\r\nloved the river-god Tavy, and while gathering flowers to weave a garland\r\nfor him was surprised by a satyr, who pursued her into a wood. She sought\r\nrefuge in a cave, where, being overtaken by her pursuer, she prayed to\r\nDiana, and in the last resort to Ina, by whom she was transformed into a\r\nspring, which, after drowning the venturesome satyr, ran on to join its\r\nwaters with those of her beloved Tavy. Thus Browne wove the common names\r\nof his familiar home into a romance of pastoral invention. The\r\nmetamorphosis of Arethusa pursued by Alpheus, of Ambra by Ombrone, of the\r\nnymphs by the satyrs of the _Salices_, or as frescoed on the temple of\r\nPales in the _Arcadia_, the loves of Mulla and Mollana in Spenser, and the\r\nmythological impersonations of the _Polyolbion_, find, as it were, a\r\nmeeting-place in Browne's lay of Walla.\r\n\r\nThe three parts of _Britannia's Pastorals_ did not appear together. Book\r\nI was published during the winter of 1613-14, Book II in 1616, each\r\ncontaining five songs; while the fragment of Book III, containing two\r\nsongs only, remained in manuscript till 1853, when it was discovered in\r\nthe Cathedral Library at Salisbury, and printed for the Percy\r\nSociety[136].\r\n\r\nThe narrative, as may have been inferred from what has already been said,\r\nis sufficiently fantastic. In the introduction of allegorical characters\r\nBrowne was probably influenced by Spenser, and in a lesser degree by the\r\nmasque literature of his day and by the study of Langland. Since the work\r\nis unfinished, we may in charity suppose that had Browne completed his\r\ndesign the whole would have presented a somewhat less incongruous\r\nappearance; there is, however, a marked tendency towards the accumulation\r\nof unexplained incidents, which may most plausibly be referred to the\r\ninfluence of the Spanish romances, especially of the _Diana_, which was\r\nalready accessible in Yong's translation, and one incident of which Browne\r\ndid undoubtedly borrow.\r\n\r\nIn style and poetic merit Browne's work is most astonishingly unequal,\r\nthough the general level of _Britannia's Pastorals_ is distinctly higher\r\nthan that of the _Shepherd's Pipe_. The author passes at times abruptly\r\nfrom careful and loving realism to the most stilted conventionality, and\r\nfrom passages of impassioned eloquence to others grotesquely banal. In\r\nsome of his peculiarities, as in the perpetuai use of elaborate similes\r\nand in the indulgence in inflated paraphrases, he anticipates some of the\r\nworst faults of style cultivated by writers of the next century. There are\r\nportions of the poem where the narrative is literally carried on through a\r\nsuccession of highly wrought comparisons, each paragraph beginning with an\r\n'As' followed by a correlative 'So' half a page further on. No such series\r\nof pictures, however fairly wrought--and Browne's too often end in\r\nbathos--can possibly convey the impression of continuons action. It is the\r\nsame with periphrasis. Used with discretion it may be one of the subtlest\r\nornaments of style, and even when fulfilling no particular purpose is\r\ncapable of imparting a luxuriant and somewhat rococo richness to the\r\nverse. The effect, however, is frequently one of unrelieved frigidity, as\r\nin the lines:\r\n\r\n    And now Hyperion from his glitt'ring throne\r\n    Sev'n times his quick'ning rays had bravely shown\r\n    Unto the other world, since Walla last\r\n    Had on her Tavy's head the garland plac'd;\r\n    And this day, as of right, she wends abroad\r\n    To ease the meadows of their willing load.\r\n                                 (II. iii. 855.)\r\n\r\nAt times it was Browne's moral preoccupation that curbed his muse, as in\r\nhis description of the golden age where, for the sensuous glow of Tasso\r\nand for Carew's pagan paradise, he substitutes the insipid convention of a\r\nphilosophical age of innocence[137]. In his genuine mood as a loving\r\nobserver of country life he is a very different poet. His feeling is\r\ndelicate in tone and his observation keen; he was familiar with every tree\r\nthat grew in the woods, every fish that swam in the waters of his beloved\r\nDevon; he entered tenderly into the homely life of the farm--\r\n\r\n    By this had chanticleer, the village clock,\r\n    Bidden the goodwife for her maids to knock,\r\n    And the swart ploughman for his breakfast stay'd,\r\n    That he might till those lands were fallow laid;\r\n    The hills and vailles here and there resound\r\n    With the re-echoes of the deep-mouth'd hound;\r\n    Each shepherd's daughter, with her cleanly peal,[138]\r\n    Was come afield to milk the morning's meal.\r\n                                (I. iv. 483.)\r\n\r\nWhen, however, naturalism of this kind is introduced into pastoral it is\r\nalready on the high road toward ceasing to be pastoral at all. Nor are\r\ntouches of higher poetic imagination wanting, as when Time is described as\r\n\r\n              a lusty aged swain,\r\n    That cuts the green tufts off th' enamell'd plain,\r\n    And with his scythe hath many a summer shorn\r\n    The plough'd-lands lab'ring with a crop of corn.\r\n                                 (I. iv. 307.)\r\n\r\nThe love of his country is, however, the altar at which Browne's poetic\r\ngenius takes fire:\r\n\r\n    Hail, thou my native soil! thou blessed plot,\r\n    Whose equal all the world affordeth not!\r\n    Show me who can so many crystal rills,\r\n    Such sweet-cloth'd valleys or aspiring hills,....\r\n    And if the earth can show the like again,\r\n    Yet will she fail in her sea-ruling men.\r\n    Time never can produce men to o'ertake\r\n    The fames of Grenville, Davies, Gilbert, Drake,\r\n    Or worthy Hawkins, or of thousands more\r\n    That by their power made the Devonian shore\r\n    Mock the proud Tagus, for whose richest spoil\r\n    The boasting Spaniard left the Indian soil\r\n    Bankrupt of store, knowing it would quit cost\r\n    By winning this, though all the rest were lost.\r\n                                        (II. iii. 601.)\r\n\r\nIt is after all in such a passage as this that we see the true William\r\nBrowne, with all his high-handedness and worthy enthusiasm, the poet who\r\nnot only loves his country with a lover's passion and cannot tolerate that\r\nany should be compared to her in fairness of feature, in stateliness of\r\nstature, or in virtue of mind; but who, first perhaps among English poets,\r\nhas that more local patriotism, narrower and more intimate, for his own\r\nhome, for its moors, its streams, its associations, all the actual or\r\nimagined surroundings of his beloved Tavistock, and carries in his heart\r\nfor ever the cry of the wild west--\r\n\r\n    Devon, O Devon, in wind and rain!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nApproaching the romance, as we do, from the point of view rather of the\r\ndevelopment of the pastoral ideal than of the history of prose narrative\r\nor of the novel, we may spare ourselves any detailed consideration of the\r\nfamous work of John Lyly. Although in the novel which has made 'Euphuism'\r\na word and a bye-word in the language he supplied the literary medium for\r\nthe work of subsequent pastoral writers such as Greene and Lodge, his\r\nown compositions in this kind are confined entirely to the drama.\r\n\r\nThe translations in this department are for the most part negligible.\r\nThere is, however, one notable exception, namely, the rendering by\r\nBartholomew Yong or Young of Montemayor's _Diana_, together with the\r\ncontinuations of Ferez and Gil Polo. Completed as early as May, 1583, the\r\nwork remained in manuscript until 1598, when it was published in the form\r\nof a handsome folio. Although, as we have already had occasion to notice,\r\nthe verse portions were not for the most part of a nature to add lustre to\r\nan anthology such as _England's Helicon_, the whole forms a not unworthy\r\nTudor translation. We learn from Yong's preface that portions of the\r\nromance had already been Englished by Edward Paston, a descendant of the\r\nfamous Norfolk letter-writers, who had family relations with Spain and\r\npossessed an intimate knowledge of the language. Of this work nothing\r\nfurther is known. Some two years, however, before Yong's version issued\r\nfrom the press, the first book of Montemayor's portion was again\r\ntranslated by Thomas Wilson, and of this a manuscript yet survives[139].\r\nPassing mention may also be made of Angel Day's translation of _Daphnis\r\nand Chloe_ containing the original insertion of the _Shepherd's Holiday_\r\nwith the praises of Elizabeth in verse, and of Robert Tofte's _Honours\r\nAcademy_ (1610), distantly following Ollenix du Mont-Sacré's _Bergerie de\r\nJuliette_, but which, as also John Pyper's version of d'Urfé's _Astrée_\r\n(1620), have received sufficient notice in being recorded in connexion\r\nwith their originals.\r\n\r\nEarlier in date of publication and belonging to an elder tradition than\r\nthe _Arcadia_, though later in date of composition, and it may be at times\r\nbetraying a familiarity with Sidney's manuscript, the romances of the\r\nBohemian Robert Greene, and the buccaneer-physician Thomas Lodge, are\r\nnaturally the first to claim our attention.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of _Menaphon_, Greene's romances offer little that is\r\nimportant in pastoral, apart from the more notable works which they\r\ninspired. And even _Menaphon_, in so far as the general conception is\r\nconcerned, can hardly be said necessarily to involve the existence of any\r\nantecedent pastoral tradition. Greene's novel is, indeed, far from being\r\npurely pastoral; no more than in Sidney's, to use Professor Herford's\r\nhappy phrase, are we allowed to forget that Arcadia bordered on Sparta. In\r\nthis it undoubtedly resembles the Spanish romances, but the resemblance\r\ndoes not appear to go much further; it is on the whole warlike without\r\nbeing chivalric, the tone Greek, or what Greene considered such, rather\r\nthan medieval--indeed it might be argued that in its martial incidents it\r\nrather recalls _Daphnis and Chloe_ than the _Diana_. There is certainly\r\nnothing chivalric about King Democles, who, when some ten score shepherds\r\nare besieging a castle, sends to the 'General of his Forces,' and not only\r\nhas ten thousand men brought secretly and by night at three days'\r\nnotice--in itself a notable piece of strategy--but when they arrive on the\r\nscene places furthermore the whole force in ambush! No wonder that when\r\nthe soldiers are let loose out of their necessarily cramped quarters,\r\nthey kill many of the shepherds, and putting the rest to flight remain\r\nmasters of the situation.\r\n\r\nThe plot might perhaps be considered improbable as well as intricate for\r\nanything but a pastoral or chivalric romance: judged by the standards\r\nprevailing in these species it is neither. Democles, king of Arcadia, has\r\na daughter Sephistia, who contrary to his wishes has contracted a secret\r\nmarriage with Maximus. When the birth of a son leads to discovery,\r\nDemocles has them placed in an oarless boat and so cast adrift. A storm\r\narising they are not unnaturally wrecked, and ultimately husband and wife\r\nare cast upon different points of the Arcadian coast(!), where, either\r\nsupposing the other to have perished, they adopt the pastoral life,\r\nassuming the names respectively of Melicertus and Samela. The young mother\r\nhas with her child Pleusidippus, but while still in early boyhood he is\r\ncarried off by pirates and presented as a gift to the King of Thessaly. In\r\nthe meantime Menaphon, 'the king's shepherd of Arcadia,' has fallen in\r\nlove with Samela, but while accepting his hospitality she meets her\r\nhusband in his shepherd's guise, and without recognizing one another\r\nhusband and wife again fall in love. Years pass on and Pleusidippus, who\r\nhas risen to fame at court, hears of the beauty of the shepherdess of\r\nArcadia, and must needs go to test the truth of the report himself. He\r\ndoes so, and promptly falls in love with his own mother. Nor is this all,\r\nfor Democles equally hears of Samela's fame, and disguising himself as a\r\nshepherd falls in love with his own daughter. He endeavours to command\r\nSamela's affection by revealing to her his own identity, but Pleusidippus\r\nis beforehand with more drastic measures, and with the help of a few\r\nassociates carries Samela off to a neighbouring castle, to which Democles\r\nand the shepherds, headed by Melicertus, proceed to lay siege. A duel\r\nbetween father and son is unceremoniously interrupted by the inroad of\r\nDemocles' soldiery. Upon this the identity of Samela is revealed by a\r\nconvenient prophetess, and all ends happily.\r\n\r\nIn the relation of verse and prose Greene's work differs from that of\r\nSannazzaro and Sidney, the former being of considerably greater merit than\r\nthe latter. The style adopted exhibits a very marked Euphuism, and the\r\nwhole form of narrative is characterized by that fondness for petty\r\nconceit which not seldom gives an air of puerility to the lighter\r\nElizabethan prose. Puerile in a sense it had every right to be, for modern\r\nprose narration was then in its very infancy in this country. No artistic\r\nform destined to contribute to the main current of literature is born\r\nperfect into the world; the early efforts appear not only tentative,\r\nuncouth, at times rugged, but often childish and futile, unworthy the\r\nconsideration of serions men. The substance of the _Gesta Romanorum_ and\r\nthe style of the _Novellino_ appear so, considered in relation to the\r\n_Decameron_; the mystery plays are an obvious instance, not to be\r\nexplained by any general immaturity of medieval ideas. Traces of the\r\ntendency may even be noticed where revival or acclimatization, rather than\r\noriginal invention, is the aim; we find it in the _Shepherd's Calender_,\r\nnor was it absent in the days of the romantic revival, either from the\r\nGerman _Lenores_ or the English _Otrantos_. And so it is with the\r\nnovelists of the Elizabethan age. Renouncing the traditions of the older\r\nromance, which was adult and perfect a hundred years before in Malory, but\r\nhad now fallen into a second childhood, and determined on the creation of\r\na new and genuine form of literary expression, they paid the price of\r\noriginality in the vein of childishness that runs through their writings.\r\n\r\nIf, however, Greene was content in the main to adopt the style of the new\r\nnovel, he, as indeed Lyly too, could at times snatch a straightforward\r\nthought or a vigorous phrase from current speech or controversial\r\nliterature, and invest it with all the greater effectiveness by\r\ncontrasting it with its surroundings. Here, as an example of euphuistic\r\ncomposition, is Democles' address to the champions about to engage in\r\nsingle combat:\r\n\r\n  Worthy mirrors of resolved magnanimitie, whose thoughts are above your\r\n  fortunes, and your valour more than your revenewes, know that Bitches\r\n  that puppie in hast bring forth blind whelpes; that there is no herbe\r\n  sooner sprung up than the Spattarmia nor sooner fadeth; the fruits too\r\n  soone ripe are quickly rotten; that deedes done in hast are repented at\r\n  leisure: then, brave men in so weightie a cause,... deferre it some\r\n  three daies, and then in solemn manner end the combat[140].\r\n\r\nWith this we may contrast the closing sentence of the work:\r\n\r\n  And lest there should be left any thing imperfect in this pastorall\r\n  accident, Doron smudged himselfe up, and jumped a marriage with his old\r\n  friend Carmela.\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, intentionally cast in a homely style in contrast to\r\nthe courtliness of the main plot; but Greene, as some of his later works\r\nattest, knew the value of strong racy English no less than his friend\r\nNashe, who, in the preface he prefixed to this very work, pushed\r\ncolloquialism and idiom to the verge of affectation and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe incidental verse, on the other hand, though very unequal, is of\r\ndecidedly higher merit. Sephistia's famous song should alone suffice to\r\nsave any book from oblivion, while there are other verses which are not\r\nunworthy of a place beside it. I may instance the opening of the\r\n'roundelay' sung by Menaphon, the only character strictly belonging to\r\npastoral tradition, with its picture of approaching night:\r\n\r\n    When tender ewes brought home with evening Sunne\r\n      Wend to their foldes,\r\n      And to their holdes\r\n    The shepheards trudge when light of day is done.\r\n\r\nSuch as it was, _Menaphon_ appealed in no small degree to the taste of the\r\nmoment. We know how great was Greene's reputation as an author, how\r\npublishers were ready to outbid one another for the very dregs of his wit.\r\nThomas Brabine was but voicing the general opinion when, in some verses\r\nprefixed to _Menaphon_, he wrote, condescending to an inevitable pun, but\r\nalso to a less excusable mixed metaphor:\r\n\r\n    Be thou still Greene, whiles others glorie waine.\r\n\r\nOf his other romances it is sufficient in this place to mention that\r\n_Pandosto_, which contains the pastoral loves of Dorastus and Fawnia, and\r\nsupplied Shakespeare with the outlines of the _Winter's Tale_, appeared\r\nthe year before _Menaphon_, while the year after saw his _Never Too Late_,\r\nwhich is likewise of a generally pastoral character, but does not appear\r\nto have suggested or influenced any subsequent work.\r\n\r\nThe remarks that have been made concerning Greene apply in a large\r\nmeasure also to his fellow euphuist Thomas Lodge. His earliest romance,\r\n_Forbonius and Prisceria_, published in 1584, is partly pastoral in plot,\r\na faithful lover being driven by the opposition of his lady's father into\r\nassuming the pastoral habit; but it is chiefly the connexion of his\r\n_Rosalynde_ of 1590 with Shakespeare's _As You Like It_ that gives him a\r\nclaim upon our attention. _Rosalynde_ is not only on this account the\r\nbest-known, but is also intrinsically the most interesting of his\r\nromances. The story is too familiar to need detailing. Its origin, as is\r\nalso well known, is the _Tale of Gamelyn_, the story which Chaucer\r\nintended putting into the mouth either of the cook, or more probably of\r\nthe yeoman, and the hero of which apparently belongs to the Robin Hood\r\ncycle. The interest centres round the three sons of Sir John of Bordeaux,\r\nwho retains his name with Lodge and is Shakespeare's Sir Roland de Bois,\r\nand whose youngest son, Lodge's Rosader and Shakespeare's Orlando, is\r\nnamed Gamelyn, and the outlaw king, Lodge's king of France and\r\nShakespeare's Duke senior[141]. The entire pastoral element, as well as\r\nthe courtly scenes of the earlier portion of the novel, are Lodge's own\r\ninvention. His shepherds, whether genuine, as Coridon and Phoebe, or\r\nassumed, as Rosalynde and Rosader, are all alike Italian Arcadians,\r\nequally polished and poetical. Montanus, a shepherd corresponding to\r\nShakespeare's Silvius, is a dainty rimester, and is not only well posted\r\nin the loves of Polyphemus and Galatea, but can rail on blind boy Cupid in\r\ngood French, and on his mistress too--\r\n\r\n    Son cuer ne doit estre de glace,\r\n    Bien que elle ait de Neige le sein.\r\n\r\nThus Lodge added to the original story the figures of the usurper,\r\nRosalynde, Alinda (Celia), and the shepherds Montanus (Silvius), Coridon\r\n(Corin) and Phoebe, while to Shakespeare we owe Amiens, Jacques,\r\nTouchstone, Audre, and a few minor characters; whence it appears that\r\nLodge's contribution forms the mainstay of the plot as familiar to modern\r\nreaders. Moreover, in spite of the stiltedness of the style where the\r\nauthor yet remembers to be euphuistic, in spite of the long 'orations,'\r\n'passions,' 'meditations' and the like, each carefully labelled and giving\r\nto the whole the air of a series of rhetorical exercises, in spite of the\r\nmediocre quality of most of the verses, if we except its one perfect gem,\r\nthe romance yet retains not a little of its silvan and idyllic sweetness.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the school of Lyly, which included a number of more or less\r\nfamous writers, I may take the opportunity of mentioning two authors\r\nusually reckoned among them. One, John Dickenson, left two works of a\r\npastoral nature. His short romance entitled _Arisbas_ appeared in 1594,\r\nand may have supplied Daniel with a hint for the kidnapping of Silvia in\r\n_Hymen's Triumph_. Another yet shorter work, entitled the _Shepherd's\r\nComplaint_, which is undated, but was probably printed in the same year,\r\nis remarkable for being composed more than half in verse, largely\r\nhexameters. In it the author falls asleep and is transported in his dreams\r\nto Arcady, where he listens to the lament of a shepherd for the love of\r\nAmaryllis. The cruel nymph is, however, soon punished, for, challenging\r\nDiana in beauty, she falls a victim to the shafts of the angry goddess,\r\nand is buried with full bucolic honours, whereupon the author awakes. The\r\nother writer is William Warner, well known from his _Albion's England_,\r\npublished in 1586, who left a work entitled _Pan his Syrinx_, which\r\nappeared in 1584; but in this pastoralism does not penetrate beyond the\r\ntitle-page.\r\n\r\nOf the books which everybody knows and nobody reads, _The Countess of\r\nPembroke's Arcadia_ is perhaps the most famous[142]. Yet though an account\r\nof the romance may be found in the pages of every literary textbook, the\r\nhistory of how the work came to be printed has never been fully cleared\r\nup[143]. The _Arcadia_, as it remained at Sidney's death, was\r\nfragmentary. Two books and a portion of a third were all that had\r\nundergone revision, and possibly represented the portion which Sidney\r\ncompiled while living with his sister at Wilton, after his retirement from\r\ncourt in 1581--the portion for the most part actually written in his\r\nsister's presence. Even of this trustworthy manuscripts were rare, most of\r\nthose that circulated being copies of the unrevised text. Sidney died on\r\nOctober 17, 1586, and even before the end of the year we find his friend\r\nFulke Greville, afterwards Lord Brooke, writing to Sidney's father-in-law,\r\nSir Francis Walsingham, to the effect that the bookseller, William\r\nPonsonby, had informed him that some one was about to print the _Arcadia_,\r\nand that if they were acting without authority a notification of the fact\r\nshould be lodged with the archbishop. Greville proceeds to say that he had\r\nsent to Walsingham's daughter, that is, Lady Sidney, the corrected\r\nmanuscript of the work 'don 4 or 5 years sinse, which he left in trust\r\nwith me; wherof there is no more copies, and fitter to be reprinted then\r\nthe first, which is so common[144].' A complaint was evidently lodged, and\r\nthe publication stayed, and we may assume that Ponsonby was rewarded for\r\nhis notification by being entrusted with the publication of the revised\r\nmanuscript mentioned by Greville, for it was from his house that issued\r\nthe quarto edition of 1590. Evidence that it was Greville who was\r\nresponsible for the publication of the _Arcadia_ is found in the\r\ndedication of Thomas Wilson's manuscript translation from the _Diana_,\r\nwhere, addressing Greville, the translater speaks of Sir Philip's\r\n_Arcadia_, 'w^{ch} by yo^{r} noble vertue the world so hapily enjoyes.' In\r\nthis edition, containing the first two and a half books only, the division\r\ninto chapters and the arrangement of the incidental verse were the work of\r\nthe 'over-seer of the print.' The text, however, was not considered\r\nsatisfactory, and when the romance was reprinted in 1593 the division into\r\nchapters was discarded, certain alterations were made in the arrangement\r\nof the verse, and there was added another portion of the third book,\r\ntogether with a fourth and fifth, compiled by the Countess of Pembroke\r\nfrom the loose sheets sent her from time to time by her brother. This\r\nedition has been commonly regarded as the first published with due\r\nauthority, and the term 'surreptitious' has been quite unjustly applied to\r\nthe original quarto. The charge, indeed, receives colour from the preface,\r\nsigned H. S., to the second edition; but, whoever H. S. may have been,\r\nthere is nothing to make one suppose that he was speaking with authority.\r\nThe quarto of 1590 having been duly licensed on August 23, 1588, the\r\nrights of the work were in Ponsonby's hands, and to him the publication of\r\nthe revised edition had to be entrusted. In 1598 a third edition, to which\r\nother remains of the author were for the first time added, was also\r\npublished by Ponsonby. There still remained, however, a lacuna in Book\r\nIII, which was not remedied till 1621, when a supplement was added from\r\nthe pen of Sir William Alexander. In the edition of 1627 a sixth book was\r\nappended, the work of one Richard Beling, whose initials alone, however,\r\nappear. The early editors seem to have assumed that the unfinished state\r\nof the work, or rather the unrevised state of the later portions, was due\r\nto the author's early death, but most of it must have been written between\r\nthe years 1581 and 1583, and it may well be questioned whether in any case\r\nSidney would have bestowed any further attention upon it. Jonson, indeed,\r\nhas preserved the tradition that it had been Sir Philip's intention 'to\r\nhave transform'd all his Arcadia to the stories of King Arthure[145],'\r\nthough how the transformation was to be accomplished he forbore to hint;\r\nbut the more familiar tradition of Sidney's having expressed on his\r\ndeath-bed a desire that the romance should be destroyed assorts better\r\nwith what else we know of his regard for his 'idle worke.'\r\n\r\nFor the name of his romance Sidney was no doubt indebted to Sannazzaro,\r\nwhom he twice mentions as an authority in his _Defence of Poesy_, but\r\nthere in all probability his direct obligation ends, since even the _rime\r\nsdrucciole_, which he occasionally affected, may with equal probability be\r\nreferred to the influence of the _Diana_. It was, undoubtedly,\r\nMontemayor's romance which served as a model for, or rather suggested the\r\ncharacter of, Sidney's work[146]. Thus the chivalric element, unknown to\r\nSannazzaro, is with Sidney even more prominent than with Montemayor and\r\nhis followers. It is, however, true that, like Greene's, his heroes are\r\nrather of a classical than a medieval stamp, and he also chose to lay the\r\nscene of the action in Greece rather than in his native land, as was the\r\nhabit of Spanish writers. The source upon which Sidney chiefly drew for\r\nincidents was the once famous _Amadis of Gaul_, but a diligent reading of\r\nthe other French and Spanish romances of chivalry would probably lengthen\r\nthe list of recorded creditors. Heliodorus supplies several episodes, and\r\nan acquaintance at least can be traced with both Achilles Tatius and\r\nChariton.\r\n\r\nThe intricate plot, with its innumerable digressions, episodes, and\r\ninterruptions, need not here be followed in detail, especially as we shall\r\nhave ample opportunity of becoming familiar with its general features when\r\nwe come to discuss the plays founded upon it. Here it will be sufficient\r\nto note one or two points. In the first place the romance contains no\r\nreally pastoral characters, the personae being all either shepherds in\r\ntheir disguise only, or else, like Greene's Doron and Carmela, burlesque\r\ncharacters of the rustic tradition. Secondly, it may be observed that the\r\namorous confusion is even greater than in _Menaphon_, Pyrocles disguising\r\nhimself as an Amazon in order to enjoy the company of his beloved\r\nPhiloclea, which leads to her father Basilius falling in love with him in\r\nhis disguise, and endeavouring to use his daughter to forward his suit,\r\nwhile her mother Gynecia likewise falls in love with him, having detected\r\nhis disguise, and becomes jealous of her daughter, who on her part\r\ninnocently accepts her lover as bosom companion[147].\r\n\r\nIn general the _Arcadia_ is no more than it purports to be, the 'many\r\nfancies' of Sidney's fertile imagination poured forth in courtly guise for\r\nthe entertainment of his sister, though his own more serious thoughts\r\noccasionally find expression in its pages, and he even introduces himself\r\nunder the imperfect anagram of Philisides, and shadows forth his\r\nfriendship with the French humanist Languet. More than this it would be\r\nrash to assert, and Greville did his friend an equivocal service when he\r\nsought to find a deep philosophy underlying the rather formal characters\r\nof the romance[148]. These characters, as we have seen, are for the most\r\npart essentially courtly; the pastoral guise is a mere veil shielding them\r\nfrom the crude uncompromising light of actuality, with its prejudice in\r\nfavour of the probable; while the few rustic personages merely supply a\r\nnot very successful comic antimasque.\r\n\r\nTo the popularity of the _Arcadia_ it is hardly necessary to advert. It\r\nhas been repeatedly printed, added to, imitated, abbreviated, modernized,\r\npopularized; four editions appeared during the last decade of the\r\nsixteenth century, nine between the beginning of the seventeenth and the\r\noutbreak of the civil wars[149]. It was first published at a moment when\r\nthe public was beginning to tire of Euphuism, and when the heroic death of\r\nthe author had recently set a seal upon the brilliance of his fame.\r\nLooking back in after years, writers who, like Drayton, had lived through\r\nthe movement from its very birth, could speak of Sidney as of the author\r\nwho\r\n\r\n                        did first reduce\r\n    Our tongue from Lyly's writing then in use,\r\n\r\nand could praise his style as a model of pure English. In spite of the\r\ngenerous, if misguided, efforts of occasional critics, posterity has not\r\nseen fit to endorse this view. While finding in Sidney's style the same\r\nhistorical importance as in Lyly's, we cannot but recognize that in itself\r\nArcadianism was little if at all better than Euphuism. It is just as\r\nformal, just as much a trick, just as stilted and unpliable, just as\r\npainful an illustration of the fact that a figure of rhetoric may be an\r\noccasional ornament, but cannot by any degree of ingenuity be made to\r\nserve as a basis of composition. In the same way as Euphuism is founded\r\nupon a balance of the sentence obtained by antithetical clauses, and the\r\nuse of intricate alliteration, together with the abuse of simile and\r\nmetaphor drawn from what has been aptly termed Lyly's 'un-natural\r\nhistory'; so Sidney's style in the _Arcadia_ is based on a balance usually\r\nobtained by a repetition of the same word or a jingle of similar ones,\r\ntogether with the abuse of periphrasis, and, it may be added, of the\r\npathetic fallacy. These last have been dangers in all periods of stylistic\r\nexperiment; the former, figures duly noted as ornaments by contemporary\r\nrhetoricians, Sidney no doubt borrowed from Spain. There in one famous\r\nexample they were shortly to excite the enthusiasm of the knight of La\r\nMancha--'The reason of the unreason which is done to my reason in such\r\nmanner enfeebles my reason that with reason I lament your beauty'--a\r\nsentence which one is sometimes tempted to imagine Sidney must have set\r\nbefore him as a model. Thus it would appear that, for their essential\r\nelements, Euphuism and Arcadianism, though distinct, alike sought their\r\nmodels, direct or indirect, in the Spanish literature of the day. Almost\r\nany passage, chosen at random, will illustrate Sidney's style. Observe the\r\nbalance of clauses in the following sentence from Kalander's speech, which\r\ninclines perhaps towards Euphuism:\r\n\r\n  I am no herald to enquire of mens pedegrees, it sufficeth me if I know\r\n  their vertues, which, if this young mans face be not a false witnes, doe\r\n  better apparrell his minde, then you have done his body. (1590, fol.\r\n  8v.)\r\n\r\nOr again, as an instance of the jingle of words, take the following from\r\nthe steward's narration:\r\n\r\n  I thinke you thinke, that these perfections meeting, could not choose\r\n  but find one another, and delight in that they found, for likenes of\r\n  manners is likely in reason to drawe liking with affection; mens actions\r\n  doo not alwaies crosse with reason: to be short, it did so in deed. (ib.\r\n  fol. 20.)\r\n\r\nOf Sidney's power of description the stock example is his account of the\r\nArcadian landscape (fol. 7), and it is perhaps the best and at the same\r\ntime the most characteristic that could be found; the author's peculiar\r\ntricks are at once obvious. There are 'the humble valleis, whose base\r\nestate semed comforted with refreshing of silver rivers,' and the\r\n'thickets, which being lined with most pleasant shade, were witnessed so\r\nto by the chereful deposition of many wel-tuned birds'; there are the\r\npastures where 'the prety lambs with bleting oratory craved the dams\r\ncomfort,' where sat the young shepherdess knitting, whose 'voice comforted\r\nher hands to work, and her hands kept time to her voices musick,' a\r\ncountry where the scattered houses made 'a shew, as it were, of an\r\naccompanable solitarines, and of a civil wildnes,' where lastly--_si sic\r\nomnia_!--was the 'shepheards boy piping, as though he should never be\r\nold.' It must not be supposed that these are occasional embroideries; they\r\nare the very cloth of which the whole pastoral habit is made. The above\r\nexamples all occur within a few pages, and might even have been gathered\r\nfrom a yet smaller plot. It is, however, on the prose, such as it is, that\r\nthe reputation of the _Arcadia_ rests; a good deal of occasional verse is\r\nintroduced, but it has often been subject of remark how wholly unworthy of\r\nits author most of it is.\r\n\r\nGiven the widespread popularity of the work, the influence exercised by\r\nthe story on English letters is hardly a matter for wonder. Of its general\r\ninfluence on the drama it will be my business to speak later; at present\r\nwe may note that while yet in manuscript it probably supplied Lodge with\r\ncertain hints for his _Rosalynde_, and so indirectly influenced _As You\r\nLike It_. One of the best-known episodes, again, that of Argalus and\r\nParthenia, was versified by Quarles in 1632, and, adorned with a series of\r\ncuts, went through a large number of editions before the end of the\r\ncentury, besides being dramatized by Glapthorne. The incident of Pyrocles\r\nheading the Zelots has been thought to have suggested the scene in the\r\n_Two Gentlemen of Verona_ in which Valentine consents to lead the robber\r\nband, while to Sidney Shakespeare was likewise indebted, not only for the\r\ncowards' fight in _Twelfth Night_, but in the 'story of the Paphlagonian\r\nunkinde king,' for the original of the Gloster episode in _King Lear_. A\r\ncertain prayer out of the later portion of the romance was, as is well\r\nknown, a favourite with Charles I in the days of his misfortune, but the\r\ncontroversial use made of the fact by Milton it is happily possible to\r\npass over in silence.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is worth mentioning as illustrating the vogue of Sidney's\r\nromance, that it not only had the very singular honour of being translated\r\ninto French in the first half of the seventeenth century, but that two\r\ntranslations actually appeared, the rivalry between which gave rise to a\r\nliterary controversy of some asperity[150].\r\n\r\nThus we take leave of the pastoral novel or romance, a kind which never\r\nattained to the weighty tradition of the eclogue, or the grace of the\r\nlyric, nor was subjected to the rigorous artistic form of the drama[151].\r\nIt remained throughout nerveless and diffuse, and, in spite of much\r\nincidental beauty, was habitually wanting in interest, except in so far as\r\nit renounced its pastoral nature. As Professor Raleigh has put it: 'To\r\ndevise a set of artificial conditions that shall leave the author to work\r\nout the sentimental inter-relations of his characters undisturbed by the\r\nintrusion of probability or accident is the problem; love _in vacuo_ is\r\nthe beginning and end of the pastoral romance proper.' A similar attempt\r\nis noticeable in the drama, but the conditions soon came to be recognized\r\nas impossible for artistic use. The operation of human affection under\r\nutterly imaginary and impossible conditions is not a matter of human\r\ninterest; the resuit was a purely fictitious amatory code, as absurd as it\r\nwas unhealthy, and, when sustained by no extrinsic interest of allegory or\r\nthe like, the kind soon disappeared. As it is, in the pastoral novel, it\r\nis only when the enchanted circle is broken by the rough and tumble of\r\nvulgar earthly existence that on the featureless surface of the waters\r\nsomething of the light and shade of true romance replaces the steady\r\npitiless glare ot a philosophical or sentimental ideal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\n\r\nItalian Pastoral Drama\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now passed in review the main classes of non-dramatic pastoral\r\nboth abroad and in this country. Such preliminary survey was necessary in\r\norder to obtain an idea of the history and nature of pastoral composition\r\nin general. It was further rendered imperative by more particular\r\nconsiderations which will appear in the course of the present chapter, for\r\nwe shall find that the pastoral drama comes into being, not through the\r\ninfusion of the Arcadian ideal into pre-existing dramatic forms, but\r\nthrough the actual evolution of a new dramatic form from the pre-existing\r\nnon-dramatic pastoral.\r\n\r\nIt is time to retrace our steps and to pick up the thread which we dropped\r\nin a former chapter, the development, namely, of the vernacular eclogue in\r\nItaly. If in so doing we are forced to enter at greater length upon the\r\ndiscussion of individual works, we shall find ample excuse, not only in\r\ntheir intrinsic merit, but likewise in their more direct bearing upon what\r\nis after all the main subject of this volume. The pastoral drama of Italy\r\nis the immediate progenitor of that of England. Further, it might be\r\npleaded that special interest attaches to the Arcadian pastoral as the\r\nonly dramatic form of conspicuous vitality for which Italy is the crediter\r\nof European letters.\r\n\r\nThe history of the rise of the pastoral drama in Italy is a complicated\r\nsubject, and one not altogether free from obscurity. Many forces were at\r\nwork determining the development of the form, and these it is difficult so\r\nto present as at once to leave a clear impression and yet not to allow any\r\none element to usurp an importance it does not in reality possess. Any\r\naccount which gives a specious appearance of simplicity to the case\r\nshould be mistrusted. That I have been altogether successful in my\r\ntreatment I can hardly hope, but at least the method followed has not been\r\nhastily adopted. I propose to consider, first of all and apart from the\r\nrest, the early mythological drama, which while exercising a marked\r\ninfluence over the spirit of the later pastoral can in no way be regarded\r\nas its origin. Next, I shall trace the evolution of the pastoral drama\r\nproper from its germ in the non-dramatic eclogue, by way of the _ecloghe\r\nrappresentative_, and treat incidentally the allied rustic shows, which\r\nform a class apart from the main line of development. Lastly, I shall have\r\nto say a few words concerning the early pastoral plays by Beccari and\r\nothers before turning to the masterpieces of Tasso and Guarini, the\r\nconsideration of which will occupy the chief part of this chapter[152].\r\n\r\nThe class of productions known as mythological plays, which powerfully\r\ninfluenced the character of the pastoral drama, sprang from the union of\r\nclassical tradition with the machinery of native religious\r\nrepresentations, in Poliziano's _Favola d' Orfeo_. This was the first\r\nnon-religious play in the vernacular, and its dependence on the earlier\r\nreligious drama is striking. Indeed, the blending of medieval and\r\nclassical forms and conventions may be traced throughout the early secular\r\ndrama of Italy. Boiardo's _Timone_, a play written at some unknown date\r\nprevious to 1494, preserves, in spite of its classical models, much of the\r\nallegorical character of the morality, and was undoubtedly acted on a\r\nstage comprising two levels, the upper representing heaven in which Jove\r\nsat enthroned on the seat of Adonai. The same scenic arrangement may well\r\nhave been used in the _Orfeo_, the lower stage representing Hades[153];\r\nwhile Niccolò da Correggio's _Cefalo_ was evidently acted on a polyscenic\r\nstage, the actors passing in view of the audience from one part to\r\nanother[154]. At a yet earlier period Italian writers in the learned\r\ntongue had taken as the subjects of their plays stories from classical\r\nlegend and myth, and among these we find not only recognized tragedy\r\nthemes such as the rape of Polyxena dramatized by Lionardo Bruni, but\r\ntales such as that of Progne put on the stage by Gregorio Corrado, both of\r\nwhich preceded by many years the work of Politian and Correggio.\r\n\r\nThe earliest secular play in Italian is, then, nothing but a _sacra\r\nrappresentazione_ on a pagan theme, a fact which was probably clearly\r\nrecognized when, in the early editions from 1494 onwards, the piece was\r\ndescribed as the 'festa di Orpheo[155].' It was written in 1471, when\r\nPoliziano was about seventeen, and we learn from the author's epistle\r\nprefixed to the printed edition that ît was composed in the short space of\r\ntwo days for representation before Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga at Mantua.\r\nFrom the same epistle we learn that the author desired, or at least\r\nassumed the attitude of desiring, that his composition should share the\r\nfate of the ill-fashioned Lacedaemonian children; 'Cognoscendo questa mia\r\nfigliuola essere di qualità da fare più tosto al suo padre vergogna che\r\nonore; e più tosto atta a dargli malinconia che allegrezza.' The _favola_\r\nas originally put forth continued to be reprinted without alteration, till\r\n1776, when Ireneo Affò published the _Orphei Tragoedia_ from a collation\r\nof two manuscripts. This differs in various respects from the printed\r\nversion, among others in being divided, short as it is, into five acts,\r\nheaded respectively 'Pastorale,' 'Ninfale,' 'Eroico,' 'Negromantico,' and\r\n'Baccanale.' It is now known to represent a revision of the piece made,\r\nprobably by Antonio Tebaldeo, for representation at Ferrara, and in it\r\nmuch of the popular and topical element has been eliminated. The action\r\nof the piece is based in a general manner upon the story given by Ovid in\r\nthe tenth book of the _Metamorphoses_.\r\n\r\nThe performance begins with a prologue by Mercury which is nothing but a\r\nshort argument of the whole plot. 'Mercurio annunzia la festa' is the\r\nsuperscription in the original, evidently suggested by the appearance of\r\n'un messo di Dio' with which the religious _rappresentazioni_ usually\r\nopen. At the end of this prologue a shepherd appears and finishes the\r\nsecond octave with the couplet:\r\n\r\n    State attenti, brigata; buono augurio;\r\n    Poi che di cielo in terra vien Mercurio.\r\n\r\nIn the Ferrarese revision these stanzas appear as 'Argomento' without\r\nmention of Mercury, while for the above lines are substituted the\r\nastonishing doggerel:\r\n\r\n    Or stia ciascuno a tutti gli atti intento,\r\n    Che cinque sono; e questo è l' argomento.\r\n\r\nThereupon (beginning Act I of the revision) enters Mopso, an old shepherd,\r\nmeeting Aristeo, a youthful one, with his herdsman Tirsi. Mopso asks\r\nwhether his white calf has been seen, and Aristeo, who fancies he has\r\nheard a lowing from beyond the hill, sends his boy to see. In the\r\nmeanwhile he detains Mopso with an account of his love for a nymph he met\r\nthe day before, and sings a _canzona_:\r\n\r\n    Ch' i' so che la mia ninfa il canto agogna[156].\r\n\r\nIt runs on the familiar themes of love: 'Di doman non c' è certezza.'\r\n\r\n    Digli, zampogna mia, come via fugge\r\n      Con gli anni insieme la bellezza snella;\r\n      E digli come il tempo ne distrugge,\r\n      Ne l' età persa mai si rinovella;\r\n      Digli che sappi usar sua forma bella,\r\n      Che sempre mai non son rose e viole...\r\n    Udite, selve, mie dolci parole,\r\n      Poi che la ninfa mia udir non vole.\r\n\r\nThe boy Tirsi now returns, having with much trouble driven the strayed\r\ncalf back to the herd, and narrates how he saw an unknown nymph of\r\nwondrous beauty gathering flowers about the hill. Aristeo recognizes from\r\nthis description the object of his love, and, leaving Mopso and Tirsi to\r\nshake their heads over his midsummer madness, goes off to find her.\r\n\r\nSo far we might be reading one of the _ecloghe rappresentative_ which we\r\nshall have to consider shortly, but of which the earliest known examples\r\ncannot well be less than ten or twelve years later than Poliziano's play.\r\nWith the exception, indeed, of one or two in Boccaccio's _Ameto_, it is\r\ndoubtful whether any vernacular eclogues had appeared at the time. The\r\ncharacter of Tirsi belongs to rustic tradition, and must be an experiment\r\ncontemporary with, if not prior to, Lorenzo's _Nencia_. The portion before\r\nthe _canzone_ is in _terza rima_; that after it, like the prologue, in\r\noctaves.\r\n\r\nThe original proceeds without break to the song of Aristeo as he pursues\r\nthe flying Euridice (Act II in the revision):\r\n\r\n    Poi che 'l pregar non vale,\r\n      E tu via ti dilegui,\r\n      El convien ch' io ti segui.\r\n    Porgimi, Amor, porgimi or le tue ale.\r\n\r\nWhile Aristeo is following Euridice, Orfeo enters upon the scene with a\r\nLatin ode in Sapphic metre in honour of Cardinal Gonzaga. A note informs\r\nus that this was originally sung by 'Messer Braccio Ugolino, attore di\r\ndetta persona d' Orfeo.' In place of this ode the revised text contains a\r\nlong 'Coro delle Driadi,' with two speeches in _terza rima_ by the\r\nchoragus, announcing and lamenting the death of Euridice, who as she fled\r\nfrom Aristeo has been stung in the foot by a serpent. After this the news\r\nof her death is reported to Orfeo--by a shepherd in the original, by a\r\ndryad in the revised version. That the substitution of the chorus for the\r\nSapphic ode is an improvement from the poetic point of view will hardly be\r\ndenied, yet this improvement has been attained at the cost of some\r\ndramatic sacrifice. In the original Orfeo is introduced naturally enough\r\nin his character of supreme poet and musician to do honour to the\r\noccasion, and it is only after he has been on the stage some time that the\r\nnews of Euridice's death is brought. In the revision he is merely\r\nintroduced for the purpose of being informed of his wife's death--he has\r\nhardly been so much as mentioned before. He thus loses the slight\r\nopportunity previously afforded him of presenting a dramatic individuality\r\napart from the very essence of his tragedy.\r\n\r\nThe announcement to Orfeo of Euridice's death begins the third act of the\r\nrevised text, which is amplified at this point by the introduction of a\r\nsatyr Mnesillo, who acts as chorus to Orfeo's lament. The character of a\r\nfriendly satyr is interesting in view of the role commonly assigned to his\r\nspecies in pastoral.\r\n\r\nAfter this we have in the original the direction 'Orfeo cantando giugne\r\nall' Inferno,' while in the revision there is again a new act, the fourth.\r\nSymonds pointed out that the merits of the piece are less dramatic than\r\nlyrical, and that fortunately the central scene was one in which the\r\nsituation was capable of lyrical expression. The pleading of Orfeo before\r\nthe gates of Hades and at the throne of Pluto forms the lyrical kernel of\r\nthe play, and gives it its poetic value. The bard appears before the\r\niron-bound portals of the nether world, and the pains of hell surcease.\r\n'Who is he?' asks Pluto--\r\n\r\n    Chi è costui che con sì dolce nota\r\n      Muove l' abisso, e con l' ornata cetra?\r\n      Io veggo ferma d' Ission la rota,...\r\n      Nè più P acqua di Tantalo s' arretra;\r\n      E veggo Cerber con tre bocche intente,\r\n      E le furie acquietar il suo lamento.\r\n\r\nAt length he stands before Pluto's throne, the seat of the God of the\r\n_sacre rappresentazioni_, the rugged rock-seat surrounded by the monstrous\r\ndemons of Signorelli's _tondo_[157]. Here in presence of the grim ravisher\r\nand of his pale consort, in whom the passionate pleading of the Thracian\r\nbard stirs long-forgotten memories of spring and of the plains of Enna,\r\nOrfeo's song receives adequate expression. It is closely imitated from the\r\ncorresponding passage in Ovid, but the lyrical perfection and passionate\r\ncrescendo of the stanzas are Poliziano's own. Addressing Pluto, Orfeo\r\ndiscovers the object of his quest:\r\n\r\n    Non per Cerber legar fo questa via,\r\n    Ma solamente per la donna mia.\r\n\r\nMay not love penetrate even the forbidden bounds of hell?--\r\n\r\n      se memoria alcuna in voi si serba\r\n    Del vostro celebrato antico amore,\r\n    Se la vecchia rapina a mente avete,\r\n    Euridice mia bella mi rendete.\r\n\r\nWhy should death grudge the few years at most which complete the span of\r\nhuman life?--\r\n\r\n    Ogni cosa nel fine a voi ritorna;\r\n      Ogni vita mortal quaggiù ricade:\r\n      Quanto cerchia la luna con sue corna\r\n      Convien che arrivi alle vostre contrade--\r\n\r\nor why reap amid the unmellowed corn?--\r\n\r\n    Così la ninfa mia per voi si serba,\r\n      Quando sua morte gli darà natura.\r\n      Or la tenera vite e l' uva acerba\r\n      Tagliata avete con la falce dura.\r\n\r\n    Chi è che mieta la sementa in erba\r\n    E non aspetti ch' ella sia matura?\r\n    Dunque rendete a me la mia speranza:\r\n    Io non vel chieggio in don, questa è prestanza.\r\n\r\nNext he invokes the pity of the stern god by the name of Chaos whence the\r\nworld had birth, and by the dread rivers of the nether world, by Styx and\r\nAcheron: 'E pel sonante ardor di Flegetonte'; and lastly, turning to 'the\r\nfaery-queen Proserpina,'\r\n\r\n    Pel pome che a te già, Regina, piacque,\r\n    Quando lasciasti pria nostro orizzonte.\r\n    E se pur me la niega iniqua sorte,\r\n    Io no vo' su tornar, ma chieggio morte![158]\r\n\r\nHell itself relents, and, as Boccaccio had written,\r\n\r\n         forse lieta gli rendeo\r\n    La cercata Euridice a condizione--\r\n\r\nthe condition being that he shall not turn to behold her before attaining\r\nonce again to the land of the living. The condition, of course, is not\r\nfulfilled. Orfeo seeks to clasp 'his half regain'd Eurydice,' with the\r\ntriumphant cry of Ovid holding the conquered Corinna in his arms:\r\n\r\n    Ite triumphales circum mea tempora lauri.\r\n      Vicimus: Eurydice reddita vita mihi est.\r\n    Haec est praecipuo Victoria digna triumpho.\r\n      Hue ades, o cura parte triumphe mea[159].\r\n\r\nHe turns, and his unsubstantial love sinks back into the realm of shadows\r\nwith the cry:\r\n\r\n    Oimè che 'I troppo amore\r\n      Ci ha disfatti ambe dua.\r\n      Ecco ch' io ti son tolta a gran furore,\r\n      Nè sono ormai più tua.\r\n\r\n    Ben tendo a te le braccia; ma non vale,\r\n    Che indietro son tirata. Orfeo mio, _vale_.\r\n\r\nAs he would follow her once more a fury bars the road.\r\n\r\nDesperate of his love, the bard now forswears for ever the company of\r\nwomen (Act V of the revised text).\r\n\r\n    Da qui innanzi vo corre i fior novelli ...\r\n      Ouesto è più dolce e più soave amore;\r\n      Non sia chi mai di donna mi favelli,\r\n      Poi che morta è colei ch' ebbe il mio core.\r\n\r\nNow that she is dead, what faith abides in woman?--\r\n\r\n    Quanto è misero l' uom che cangia voglia\r\n      Per donna, o mai per lei s' allegra, o duole!...\r\n      Che sempre è più leggier ch' al vento foglia,\r\n      E mille volte il di vuole e disvuole.\r\n      Segue chi fugge; a chi la vuol, s' asconde,\r\n      E vanne e vien come alla riva l' onde.\r\n\r\nThe cry wrung from him by his grief anticipates the cynical philosophy of\r\nlater pastorals. Upon this the scene is invaded by 'The riot of the tipsy\r\nBacchanals,' eager to avenge the insult offered to their sex[160]. They\r\ndrive the poet out, and presently returning in triumph with his 'gory\r\nvisage,' break out into the celebrated chorus 'full of the swift fierce\r\nspirit of the god.' This gained considerably by revision, and in the later\r\ntext runs as follows:\r\n\r\n    Ciascun segua, o Bacco, te;\r\n      Bacco, Bacco, oè oè.\r\n    Di corimbi e di verd' edere\r\n      Cinto il capo abbiam così\r\n      Per servirti a tuo richiedere\r\n      Festeggiando notte e dì.\r\n      Ognun beva: Bacco è quì;\r\n      E lasciate here a me.\r\n          Ciascun segua, ec.\r\n\r\n    Io ho vuoto già il mio corno:\r\n      Porgi quel cantaro in qua.\r\n      Questo monte gira intorno,\r\n      O 'l cervello a cerchio va:\r\n      Ognun corra in qua o in là,\r\n      Come vede fare a me.\r\n         Ciascun segua, ec.\r\n\r\n    Io mi moro già di sonno:\r\n      Sono io ebra o sì o no?\r\n      Più star dritti i piè non ponno.\r\n      Voi siet' ebri, ch' io lo so;\r\n      Ognun faccia com' io fo;\r\n      Ognun succe come me.\r\n        Ciascun segua, ec.\r\n\r\n    Ognun gridi Bacco, Bacco,\r\n      E poi cacci del vin giù;\r\n      Poi col sonno farem fiacco,\r\n      Bevi tu e tu e tu.\r\n      Io non posso ballar più;\r\n      Ognun gridi Evoè.[161]\r\n        Ciascun segua, o Bacco, te;\r\n        Bacco, Bacco, oè oè.\r\n\r\nLyrical beauty rather than dramatic power was, it has already been\r\nremarked, Poliziano's aim and achievement. The want of characterization in\r\nthe hero, the insignificance of the part allotted to Euridice, the total\r\ninadequacy of the tragic climax, measure the author's power as a\r\ndramatist. It is the lyrical passages--Aristeo's song, Orfeo's impassioned\r\npleading, the bacchanalian dance chorus--that supply the firm supports of\r\nart upon which rests the slight fabric of the play.\r\n\r\nThe same simplicity of construction, a simplicity in nature rather\r\nnarrative than dramatic, characterizes Niccolò da Correggio's _Cefalo_.\r\nThe play was represented in state in the great courtyard of the ducal\r\npalace at Ferrara, on the occasion of the marriage of Lucrezia d' Este\r\nwith Annibale Bentivogli, on January 21, 1487[162]. Like the _Orfeo_, the\r\npiece exhibits traces of its origin in the religious shows, though, unlike\r\nthe original draft of Poliziano's play, it is divided into five acts each\r\nof some length, and is provided with regular choruses on the classical\r\nmodel. In spite of its inferiority to the _Orfeo_ in lyric power and its\r\npossibly even greater deficiency from a dramatic point of view, it will be\r\nworth while giving some account of the piece in order to get as clear an\r\nidea as possible of the nature and limitations of the mythological drama,\r\nand also because it has never, I believe, been reprinted in modern times,\r\nand is in consequence practically unknown to English readers.\r\n\r\nThe author, a descendant of the princely house of Correggio, was born\r\nabout 1450, and married the daughter of the famous _condottiere_\r\nBartolommeo Colleoni. He lived for some years at Milan at the court of\r\nLodovico Sforza; later he migrated to that of the Estensi. In 1493 he sent\r\nan allegorical eclogue to Isabella Gonzaga at Mantua, which may possibly\r\nhave been represented, though we have no note of the fact, and the poem\r\nitself has perished[163]. He died in 1508.\r\n\r\nAfter a prologue which resembles that of the _Orfeo_ in giving an argument\r\nof the whole piece, the first act opens with a scene in which Aurora seeks\r\nthe love of Cefalo. Offended at finding her advances repulsed, the goddess\r\nhints that the wife to whom Cefalo is so careful of his faith is, for her\r\npart, more free of her favours; and upon Cefalo indignantly refusing\r\ncredence to the slander, suggests that he should himself in disguise make\r\ntrial of her fidelity. This the unfortunate youth resolves to do. He\r\napproaches Procri in the habit of a merchant, with goods for sale, and\r\ntakes the opportunity thus afforded of declaring his love. She turns to\r\nfly, but the pretended passion of his suit stays her, and she is brought\r\nto lend an ear to his cunning. He retails the commonplaces of the\r\ndespairing lover:\r\n\r\n    Deh, non fuggire, e non si altiera in vista;\r\n      Odime alquanto, e scolta i preghi mei.\r\n      Che fama mai per crudeltà se acquista?\r\n      Bellissima sei pur, cruda non dei.\r\n      Non sai che Amor non vol che se resista\r\n      A colpi soi? così vinto mi dei\r\n      Subito ch' io ti viddi; eh, non fuggire,\r\n      Forza non ti farò; deh, stammi audire.\r\n\r\nNot Jove or Phoebus he to assume strange shapes for her love; he is but\r\nher slave, and can but offer his pedlar's pack; but he knows of hidden\r\ntreasure in the earth, and hers, too, shall be vesture of the fairest.\r\nAfter gold and soft raiment comes the trump card of the seducer--secrecy:\r\n\r\n    Cosa secreta mai non se riprende;\r\n      El tempo che si perde mai non torna;\r\n      Qui non serai veduta, or che se attende\r\n      Quel se ha a dolere, che al suo ben sogiorna.\r\n      Secreto è il loco, el sol pur non vi splende;\r\n      Bella sei tu, sol manca che sii adorna\r\n      Di veste come io intendo ultra il tesoro.\r\n      Deh, non mi tener più; vedi ch' io moro.\r\n\r\nShe is almost won; one last assault, and her defences fall. Why, indeed,\r\nshould she hesitate--\r\n\r\n    Poi ch' Amor dice, ogni secreta è casta?\r\n\r\nThis stroke of cynicism is put forward as it were but half intentionally,\r\nand with no appreciation of its intense irony in the mouth of the husband.\r\nThroughout the scene indeed he appears merely as a common seducer, and the\r\nauthor seems wholly to have failed to grasp the real dramatic value of the\r\nsituation. On the other hand, the lesser art of the stage has been\r\nmastered with some success, and there is an adaptation of language to\r\naction which at least argues that the author had a vivid picture of the\r\nstaging of his play in his mind when he wrote.\r\n\r\nThe moment Procri has consented to barter her honour, Cefalo discovers\r\nhimself, and the unhappy girl flies in terror. Seeing now, too late, the\r\nresuit of his foolish mistrust, Cefalo follows with prayers and\r\nself-reproaches--\r\n\r\n                      Son ben certo\r\n    Che tu mi cognoscesti ancor coperto--\r\n\r\nbut in vain. The act ends with a song in which Aurora glories in the\r\nsuccess of her revenge--\r\n\r\n    Festegiam con tutto il core;\r\n    Biastemate hor meco Amore!\r\n\r\nIn the second act Procri, having recovered from her fright, is bent on\r\navenging herself for the deceit practised by Cefalo, upon whose supposed\r\nlove for Aurora she throws the blame in the matter. She seeks the grove of\r\nDiana, where she is enrolled among the followers of the goddess. Cefalo,\r\nwho has followed her flight, rejoins her in the wood, and there renews his\r\nprayers. She refuses to recognize him, denies being his wife, and is about\r\nto renew her flight, when an old shepherd, attracted by Cefalo's\r\nlamentation, stays her and forces her to hear her husband's pleading.\r\nOther shepherds appear on the scene, and the act ends with an eclogue. In\r\nthe next we find her reconciled to Cefalo, to whom she gives the\r\nwind-swift dog and the unerring spear which she had received as a nymph of\r\nDiana. Cefalo at once sets the hound upon the traces of a boar, and goes\r\noff in pursuit, while his wife returns home. He shortly reappears, having\r\nlost boar and hound alike, and, tired with the chase, falls asleep.\r\nMeanwhile a faun, finding Procri alone, tells her that he had seen Cefalo\r\nmeeting with his love Aurora in the wood--a piece of news in return for\r\nwhich he seeks her love. She, however, resolves to go and surprise the\r\nsupposed lovers, and setting fire to the wood, herself to perish with them\r\nin the flames. On Cefalo's return he is met with bitter reproaches, and\r\nthe act ends with a chorus of fauns and satyrs. The fourth contains the\r\ncatastrophe. Procri hides in the wood in hope of surprising her husband\r\nwith his paramour. Cefalo enters ready for the chase, and, seeing what he\r\ntakes to be a wild beast among bushes, throws the fatal spear, which\r\npierces Procri's breast. A reconciliation precedes her death, and the\r\nclose of the act is rendered effective by the successive summoning of the\r\nMuses and nymphs in some graceful stanzas. With a little polishing, such\r\nas Poliziano's bacchanalian chorus received in revision, the scene would\r\nnot be unworthy of the time and place of its production.\r\n\r\n    Oimè sorelle, o Galatea, presto!\r\n    Donate al cervo ormai un poco pace;\r\n    Soccorrete al pianger quel caso mesto.\r\n    Oimè sorelle, Procri morta giace,\r\n    L' alma spirata, e il ciel guardando tace.\r\n\r\nAt Cefalo's desire Calliope summons her sister Muses, Phillis the nymphs,\r\nafter which all join in a choral ode calling upon the divinities of\r\nmountain, wood, and stream to join in a universal lament:\r\n\r\n    Weep, spirits of the woods and of the hills,\r\n      Weep, each pure nymph beside her fountain-head,\r\n      And weep, ye mountains, in a thousand rills,\r\n    For the fair child who here below lies dead:\r\n      Mourn, all ye gods, the last of human ills,\r\n      Your sacred foreheads all ungarlanded.\r\n\r\nHere the traditional story of Cephalus and Procris, as founded on the\r\nrather inferior version in the seventh book of the _Metamorphoses_, ends.\r\nThere remains, however, a fifth act, in which Diana appears, raises\r\nProcri, and restores her to her husband.\r\n\r\nThe play, composed for the most part in octaves with choruses in _terza\r\nrima_, is, from the dramatic point of view, open to obvious and fatal\r\nobjections. The preposterous _dea ex machina_ of the last act; the\r\ninconsequence of motive and inconsistency of character, partly, it is\r\ntrue, inherent in the original story, but by no means made less obvious by\r\nthe dramatist; the insufficiency of the action to fill the necessary\r\nspace, and the inability of the author to make the most of his materials,\r\nare all alike patent. On the other hand, we have already noticed a certain\r\ntheatrical ability displayed in the writing of the first act, and we may\r\nfurther attribute the alteration by which Procri is represented as jealous\r\nof Cefalo's original lover, Aurora, instead of the wholly imaginary Aura,\r\nas in Ovid, to a desire for dramatic unity of motive.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which either the _Orfeo_ or _Cefalo_ can be regarded as\r\npastoral will now be clear, and it must be confessed that they do not\r\ncarry us very far. The two fifteenth-century plays constitute a distinct\r\nspecies which has attained to a high degree of differentiation if not of\r\ndramatic evolution, and critics who would see in them the origin of the\r\nlater pastoral drama have to explain the strange phenomenon of the species\r\nlying dormant for nearly three-quarters of a century, and then suddenly\r\ndeveloping into an equally individualized but very dissimilar form[164].\r\nIt should, moreover, be borne in mind that contemporary critics never\r\nregarded the Arcadian pastoral as in any way connected with the\r\nmythological drama, and that the writers of pastoral themselves claimed no\r\nkinship with Poliziano or Correggio, but always ranked themselves as the\r\nfollowers of Beccari alone in the line of dramatic development. On the\r\nother hand, there can be no reasonable doubt that such performances went\r\nto accustom spectators to that mixture of mythology and idealism which\r\nforms the atmosphere, so to speak, of the _Aminta_ and the _Pastor fido_.\r\nThis must be my excuse for lingering over these early works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with the Italian eclogue we saw how, at a certain point, it\r\nbegan to assume a distinctly dramatic character, and in so doing took the\r\nfirst step towards the possible evolution of a real pastoral drama. It\r\nwill be my task in the ensuing pages to follow up this clue, and to show\r\nhow the pastoral drama arose through a process of natural development from\r\nthe recited eclogue.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic tendency was indeed inherent in the eclogue from the very\r\nfirst. Throughout there is a steady growth in the use of dialogue: of the\r\nIdyls of Theocritus only about a third contain more than one character; of\r\nVergil's Bucolics at least half; of Calpurnius' all but one; of the\r\neclogues of Petrarch and Boccaccio all without exception. This tendency\r\ndid not escape Guarini, who, when not led into puerilities by his love of\r\nself-laudation, often shows considerable insight. 'The eclogue,' he says,\r\n'is nothing but a short discussion between shepherds, differing in no\r\nother manner from that sort of scene which the Latins call dialogue,\r\nexcept in so far as being whole and independent, possessing within itself\r\nboth beginning and end[165].'\r\n\r\nHaving thus gradually altered the literary form of the eclogue, this\r\ntendency towards dramatic expression next showed itself in the manner in\r\nwhich the poem was presented to the world. For circulation in print or\r\nmanuscript, or for informal reading, came to be substituted recitation in\r\ncharacter. The dialogue was divided between two persons who spoke\r\nalternately, and it is evident from the somewhat meagre texts that survive\r\nthat, in the earliest examples, these _ecloghe rappresentative_, or\r\ndramatic eclogues as I shall call them, differed in no way from the purely\r\nliterary productions which we considered in an earlier section. Evidence\r\nof actual representation is often wanting, and the exact date in most\r\ncases is uncertain; but, since there is no doubt that such performances\r\nactually did take place, we are not only justified in assuming that\r\nseveral poems of the period belong to this class, but we can also, on\r\ninternai evidence, arrange them more or less in a natural sequence of\r\ndramatic development. One such eclogue has come down to us from the pen of\r\nBaldassare Taccone, a Genoese who also wrote mythological plays on the\r\nsubjects of Danaë and Actaeon. Another, interesting as dealing with the\r\ncorruption of the Curia at a moment when its scandalous traffic was\r\ncarried on in the light of day with more than usually cynical\r\nindifference, was actually presented at Rome under the patronage of\r\nCardinal Giovanni Colonna at the carnival of 1490, during the pontificate\r\nof Innocent VIII. Gradually a more complex form was evolved, the number of\r\nspeakers was increased, and some of these made their entrance during the\r\nprogress of the recitation. So too in the matter of metrical form, the\r\nstrict _terza rima_ of the earlier examples came to be diversified with\r\n_rime sdrucciole_, and by being intermingled with verses with internal\r\nrime, with _ottava rima, settenarî_ couplets, and lyrical measures.\r\nCastiglione's representation at Urbino has been noticed previously. Among\r\nsimilar productions may be mentioned two poems by a certain Caperano of\r\nFaenza, printed in 1508, while others are found at Siena in 1517 and 1523.\r\nBesides the texts that are extant we also have record of a good many which\r\nhave perished. In 1493 the representation of eclogues formed part of the\r\nrevels prepared by Alexander VI for the marriage of Lucrezia Borgia with\r\nGiovanni Sforza, Lord of Pesaro, and this was again the case when, having\r\nbeen divorced from Giovanni, and her second husband having perished by the\r\nassassin's dagger, she finally in 1502 became the wife of Alfonso d'Este,\r\nheir to the duchy of Ferrara. Eclogues were again represented at Ferrara\r\nin 1508, and received specific mention among the dramatic performances\r\ndealt with by the laws of Venice.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the eclogue had every opportunity of developing into a\r\nregular dramatic form. At this point a variety of external influences made\r\nthemselves felt, which facilitated or modified its growth. Perhaps\r\nforemost among these should be reckoned that of the 'regular' drama--that\r\nis of the drama based upon an imitation of the classics, chiefly of the\r\nLatin authors. The conception of dramatic art which was in men's minds at\r\nthe time naturally and inevitably influenced the development of a form of\r\npoem which was daily becoming more sensibly dramatic. Next there was the\r\ninfluence of the mythological drama embodying the romantic and ideal\r\nelements of classical myth, but in form representing the tradition of the\r\nold religious plays. This led to the occasional introduction of\r\nsupernatural characters, counteracted the rationalizing influence of the\r\nRoman dramatists, and supplied the pastoral with its peculiar imaginative\r\natmosphere. Lastly, there was the 'rustic' influence, which was at no time\r\nvery strong, and left no mark upon the form as finally evolved, but which\r\nhas nevertheless to be taken into account in tracing the process of\r\ndevelopment. The influence exercised by burlesque and realistic scenes\r\nfrom real life cannot have been brought to bear on the eclogue until it\r\nhad already attained to a dramatic character of some complexity. The\r\nearliest text of the kind we possess dates from 1508, and it is doubtful\r\nwhether or not it was acted. In 1513 we have record of a rustic\r\nperformance at the Capitol, and a satyrical and allegorical piece of like\r\nnature, and belonging to the same year, is actually preserved, as is also\r\none in Bellunese dialect. These shows became the special characteristic of\r\nthe Rozzi society at Siena, in whose hands they soon developed into short\r\nrealistic farces of low life, composed in dialectal verse and acted by\r\nmembers of the society at many of the courts of Italy. The fashion,\r\nthough never widely spread, survived for many years, the most famous\r\nauthor of such pieces being Michelangelo Buonarroti the younger at the\r\nbeginning of the next century.\r\n\r\nThese _drammi rusticali_, as they were called, may not improbably have\r\nowed their origin to the fashion of rustic composition set by Lorenzo de'\r\nMedici in his _Nencia_, and may thus in their origin have been related to\r\nthe courtly eclogue; but the subsequent development of the kind is at most\r\nparallel to that of the pastoral drama, and should not be regarded either\r\nas the origin or as a subdivision of this latter. Nor did the rustic\r\ncompositions exercise any permanent influence on the pastoral drama; the\r\nmost that can be said is that an occasional text shows signs of being\r\naffected by the low vulgarity of the kind.\r\n\r\nReturning to the polite eclogues, we soon find an increase in the dramatic\r\ncomplexity of the form. Tansillo's _Due pellegrini_, which cannot be later\r\nthan 1528, contains the rudiments of a plot, two lovers bent on suicide\r\nbeing persuaded by a miraculous voice to become reconciled with the world\r\nand life. Poetic justice befalls the two nymphs in an eclogue by Luca di\r\nLorenzo, printed in 1530, the disdainful Diversa being condemned to love\r\nthe boor Fantasia, while Euridice's loving disposition is rewarded by the\r\ndevotion of Orindio.\r\n\r\nWe now come to what may almost be regarded as the first conscious attempt\r\nto write a pastoral play--an attempt, however, which met with but partial\r\nsuccess. This is the _Amaranta_, a 'Comedia nuova pastorale' by\r\nGiambattista Casalio of Faenza, which most probably belongs to a date\r\nsomewhat before 1538. In it the mutual love of Partenio and Amaranta is\r\nthwarted by the girl's mother Celia, who destines her for a goatherd.\r\nPartenio is led to believe that his love has played him false, while in\r\nher turn Amaranta supposes herself forsaken. The two meet, however, at the\r\nhut of a wise nymph Lucina, through whose intervention they are reconciled\r\nand their union effected. The piece, which attains to some proportions, is\r\ndivided into five acts, and, while owing a certain debt to the _Orfeo_, is\r\nitself pastoral in character with occasional coarse touches borrowed from\r\nthe rustic shows. It is in the _Amaranta_ that we first meet with an\r\nattempt to introduce a real plot of some human interest into a purely\r\npastoral composition; we are no longer dealing with a merely occasional\r\npiece written in celebration of some special person or festivity, no\r\nlonger with a mythological masque or pageant, nor with an amorous\r\nallegory, but with a piece the interest of which, slight as it is, lies in\r\nthe fate of the characters involved.\r\n\r\nThe fifteen years or so which separate the work of Casalio from that of\r\nBeccari saw the production of a succession of more or less pastoral works\r\nwhich serve, to some extent at least, to bridge over the gap which\r\nseparates even the most elaborate of the above compositions from the\r\nrecognized appearance of the fully-developed pastoral drama in the\r\n_Sacrifizio_. The chief characteristic which marks the work of these years\r\nis a tendency to deliberate experiment. The writers appear to have been\r\nconscious that their work was striving towards a form which had not yet\r\nbeen achieved, though they were themselves vague as to what that form\r\nmight be. Epicuro's _Mirzia_ tends towards the mythological drama; the\r\n_Silvia_ written by one Fileno, which, like the _Amaranta_, turns on the\r\ntemporary estrangement of two lovers, introduces considerable elements\r\nfrom the rustic performances; in Cazza's _Erbusto_ the amorous skein is\r\ncut by the discovery of consanguinity and an ἀναγνώρισις after the manner\r\nof the Latin comedy. Similar in plot to this last is a fragmentary\r\npastoral of Giraldi Cintio's published from manuscript by Signor Carducci.\r\nAnother curious but isolated experiment is Cintio's _Egle_, in intent a\r\nrevival of the 'satyric' drama of the Greeks, in substance a dramatization\r\nof the motive of Sannazzaro's _Salices_. In one sense these experiments\r\nended in failure; it was not through the elaboration of mythological or\r\nsuperhuman elements, nor through the humour of burlesque or realistic\r\nrusticity, nor yet through the violence of unexpected discoveries, that\r\nthe destined form of the pastoral drama was to be attained. On the other\r\nhand, they undoubtedly served to introduce an elaboration of plot and\r\ncomplexity of dramatic structure which is altogether lacking in the\r\nearlier eclogues and masques, but without which the work of Tasso and\r\nGuarini could never have occupied the commanding position that it does in\r\nthe history of literature. They carry us forward to the point at which the\r\npastoral drama took its shape and being.\r\n\r\nOf the elements compounded of pastoral idealism and the graceful purity of\r\nclassical myth, and combining the scenic attractions of the masque with\r\nthe reasoned action and human interest of the regular drama, the Arcadian\r\npastoral first achieved definite form in the work of Agostino Beccari. His\r\n_Sacrifizio_, styled 'favola pastorale' on the title-page of the first\r\nimpression, was acted at the palace of Francesco d' Este at Ferrara in the\r\npresence of Ercole II and his son Luigi, and of the Duchess Renata and her\r\ndaughters Lucrezia and Leonora, on two occasions in February and March\r\n1554. The piece was revived more than thirty years later, namely in 1587,\r\nwhen the courtly world was already familiar with Tasso's masterpiece, and\r\nwas ringing with the prospective fame of the _Pastor fido_, and\r\nrepresented both at Sassuolo and Ferrara.\r\n\r\nThe action involves three pairs of lovers. Turico loves Stellinia in spite\r\nof the fact that she has transferred her affections to Erasto. Erasto in\r\nhis turn pays his homage to Callinome, the type of the 'careless'\r\nshepherdess, a nymph vowed to the service of Diana. There remains\r\nCarpalio, whose love for Melidia is secretly returned; its consummation\r\nbeing prevented by the girl's brother Pimonio, who refuses to countenance\r\nthe match, and keeps dragon guard over his sister. In the meanwhile\r\nshepherds and shepherdesses assemble to honour the festival and sacrifice\r\nof Pan, which proves the occasion for the unravelling of the amorous\r\ntangle. Stellinia, wishing to rid herself of her rival in Erasto's love,\r\ninduces Callinome so far to break her vestal vow as to be present at the\r\nforbidden feast. Here she is promptly detected by the offended goddess and\r\nsentenced to do battle against one of the fiercest of the Erymanthian\r\nboars. Erasto comes to her aid with a magic ointment, which has the power\r\nof rendering the user invisible, and with the help of which she achieves\r\nher task unharmed. Out of gratitude she rewards her preserver with her\r\nlove. Not only is Stellinia thus condemned to witness the failure of her\r\nplot, but she is herself carried off by a satyr, who endeavours to deceive\r\neach of the nymphs in turn. Being rescued from his power by the faithful\r\nTurico, she too capitulates to love. Lastly, in the absence of Pimonio,\r\nwho has gone to be present at the games held at the festival, Carpalio and\r\nMelidia pluck the fruit of love, and are saved from the anger of the\r\nbrother through his conveniently falling into an enchanted lake whence he\r\nemerges in the shape of a boar.\r\n\r\nIn the prologue the author boldly announces the novelty of his work--\r\n\r\n    Una favola nova pastorale\r\n    ............nova in tanto\r\n    Ch' altra non fu giammai forse più udita\r\n    Di questa sorte recitarsi in scena.\r\n\r\nGuarini, who is said to have supplied a prologue for the revival of the\r\npiece, bore out Beccari's claim when he wrote in his essay on\r\ntragi-comedy: 'First among the moderns to possess the happy boldness to\r\nmake in this kind, namely the pastoral dramatic tale, of which there is no\r\ntrace among the ancients, was Agostin de' Beccari, a worthy citizen of\r\nFerrara, to whom alone does the world owe the fair creation of this sort\r\nof poem[166].'\r\n\r\nSeveral pieces of no great interest or importance serve to fill the decade\r\nor so following on the production of Beccari's play. Groto, known as the\r\nCieco d' Adria, combined the mythological motive with much of the vulgar\r\nobscenity of the Latin comedy. Lollio also produced a hybrid of an earlier\r\ntype in his _Aretusa_. In 1567 a return was made to the pastoral tradition\r\nof Beccari in Agostino Argenti's play _Lo Sfortunato_. Among the\r\nspectators who witnessed the first performance of this piece before Duke\r\nAlfonso and his court at Ferrara was a youth of twenty-two, lately\r\nattached to the household of the Cardinal Luigi d' Este. In all\r\nprobability this was Tasso's first introduction to a style of composition\r\nwhich not many years later he was to make famous throughout Europe. The\r\nplay he witnessed on that occasion, however, was no work of surpassing\r\ngenius. It cannot, indeed, be said to mark any decided advance on\r\nBeccari's work except in so far, perhaps, as it at times foreshadows the\r\nsomewhat sickly sentiment of later pastorals, including Tasso's own. The\r\nshepherd Sfortunato loves Dafne, Dafne loves Iacinto, who in his turn\r\npursues Flaminia, while she loves only Silvio, who loves himself. Nothing\r\nparticular happens till the fourth scene of Act III. Then Silvio, tired of\r\nbeing the last link in the chain of love, devises a plan for placing\r\nFlaminia and Dafne in the power of their respective lovers. Flaminia,\r\nassailed by Iacinto, makes up her mind to bow to fate, and accepts with a\r\ngood grace the love it is no longer in her power to fly. Sfortunato, on\r\nthe other hand, rather than offend his mistress, allows her to depart\r\nunharmed, and since he thereby forgoes his only chance of enjoying the\r\nobject of his passion, determines to die. His vow is overheard by Dafne,\r\nwho, seeing that her love for Iacinto may no more avail, at last relents.\r\nA third nymph, introduced to make the numbers even, takes the veil among\r\nthe followers of Diana, and so lives the object of Silvio's chaste regard.\r\nIt will be readily seen how in the character of Sfortunato we have the\r\nforerunner of Tasso's Aminta; but it will also appear what poor use has\r\nbeen made of the situation. The truth is that we have up to now been\r\ndealing merely with origins, with productions which are of interest only\r\nin the reflected light of later work; whatever there is of real beauty and\r\nof permanent value in the pastoral drama of Italy is due to the breath of\r\nlife inspired into the phantasms of earlier writers by the genius of Tasso\r\nand Guarini.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now followed the dramatic pastoral from its obscure origin in the\r\neclogue to the eve of its assuming a recognized and abiding position in\r\nthe literature of Europe[167]. But if it is in a measure easy thus to\r\ntrace back the Arcadian drama to its historical sources, and to show how\r\nthe _Aminta_ came to be possible, it is not so easy to show how it came to\r\nbe actual. All creative work is the outcome of three fashioning forces,\r\nthe historical position, the personal circumstances of the artist, and his\r\nindividual genius. The pastoral drama had reached what I may perhaps be\r\nallowed to call the 'psychological point' in its development. At the same\r\nmoment it happened that Tasso, having returned from a fruitless and\r\nuncongenial mission to the Valois court, enjoyed a brief period of calm\r\nand prosperity in the congenial society of Leonora d' Este, before the\r\ncritical bickerings to which he exposed himself in connexion with the\r\n_Gerusalemme_ wrought havoc with an already over-sensitive and\r\noverstrained temperament. Furthermore it happened that he brought to the\r\nspontaneous composition of his courtly toy just that touch of languorous\r\nbeauty, that soft vein of sentiment, which formed perhaps his most\r\ncharacteristic contribution to the artistic tone of his age, veiling a\r\nnovel mood in his favourite phrase, _un non so che_[168]. Had all this not\r\nbeen, had not the fortune of a suitable genius and the chance of personal\r\nsurroundings jumped with the historical possibility, we might indeed have\r\nhad any number of lifeless 'Sacrifices' and 'Unhappy Ones,' but Italy\r\nwould have added no new kind to the forms of dramatic art. Had it not been\r\nfor the _Aminta_, the pastoral drama must almost necessarily have been\r\nstillborn, for Guarini was too much of a pedant to do more than to imitate\r\nand enlarge, while other writers belong to the decline.\r\n\r\nThe _Aminta_, while possessing a delicate dramatic structure of its own,\r\nyet retains not a little of the simplicity of the _ecloga\r\nrappresentativa_. Indeed, it is worth noting, alike on account of this\r\nquality in the poem itself as also of its literary ancestry, that, in a\r\nletter written within a year of its original production, Tiburio Almerici\r\nspeaks of it by the old name of eclogue[169]. Referring to its\r\nrepresentation at Urbino, he writes: 'Il terzo spettacolo, che si è\r\ngoduto questo carnovale, è stato un' egloga del Tasso, che fu recitata\r\nquesto giovedì passato da alcuni gioveni d' Urbino nella sala, che fu\r\nfatta per la venuta delia Principessa.' The princess in question was none\r\nother than Lucrezia d' Este, who had lately become the wife of Tasso's\r\nformer companion Francesco Maria della Rovere, now Duke of Urbino, and who\r\nwith her sister Leonora, the heroine of the Tasso legend, had, it will be\r\nremembered, stood sponsor to Beccari's play nearly twenty years before.\r\nThe representation at Urbino to which Almerici alludes was not of course\r\nthe first. Written in the winter of 1572-3 during the absence of Duke\r\nAlfonso, the piece was acted after his return from Rome in the summer of\r\nthe latter year. Ferrara, as we have seen, had become and was long\r\ndestined to remain the special home of the pastoral drama in Italy. Here\r\non July 31, in the palace of Belvedere, built on an island in the Po, the\r\ncourt of the Estensi assembled to witness the production of Tasso's\r\nplay[170]. The staging, both on this and on subsequent occasions, was no\r\ndoubt answerable to the nature of the piece, and added the splendour of\r\nthe masque to the classic grace of the fable. Almerici remarks on the\r\nspecial attractions for spectators and auditors alike of what he calls 'la\r\nnovità del coro fra ciascuno atto,' by which he clearly meant the\r\nspectacular interludes known as _intermedî_, the verses for which are\r\ncommonly printed at the end of the play[171]. But the representation which\r\nstruck the imagination of contemporaries was that before the Grand Duke\r\nFerdinand at Florence. This took place in 1590[172]. Guarini's play had in\r\nits turn won renown far beyond the frontiers of Italy, while the author\r\nof the _Aminta_, a yet attractive but impossible madman, was destined for\r\nthe few remaining years of his life to drag his tale of woes and but too\r\noften his rags from one Italian court to another, ere he sank at last\r\nexhausted where S. Onofrio overlooks St. Peter's dome.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the play is not free from a good deal of stiffness and\r\nartificiality, which it bequeathed to its successors. It borrowed from the\r\nclassical drama a chorus, on the whole less Greek than Latin, the use of\r\nconfidants, and the introduction of messengers and descriptive passages.\r\nThese last, it may be noted, are deliberately and wantonly classical, not\r\nmerely necessitated by the exigencies of the action, difficult of\r\nrepresentation as in the attempted suicide of Aminta, impossible as in the\r\nrescue of Silvia from the satyr, but resorted to in order to veil the\r\ndramatic weakness of the author's imagination, as is plain from the\r\ndescription of the final meeting of the lovers. Yet it may be freely\r\nadmitted that to this device, the substitution namely of narrative for\r\naction, we owe most of the finest poetic passages of the play: the\r\ndescription of the youthful loves of Aminta and Silvia and the former's\r\nruse to win a kiss, the picture of Silvia bound to the tree by the pool,\r\nTirsi's account of the court, the description of Silvia at the spring--one\r\nof the most elaborate in the piece--the account of her escape from the\r\nwolves, last but not least that description of Silvia finding the\r\nunconscious Aminta, so full of subtle and effeminate seduction, prophetic\r\nof a later age of morals and of taste:\r\n\r\n    Ma come Silvia il riconobbe, e vide\r\n    Le belle guance tenere d' Aminta\r\n    Iscolorite in sì leggiadri modi,\r\n    Che viola non è che impallidisca\r\n    Si dolcemente, e lui languir sì fatto,\r\n    Che parea già negli ultimi sospiri\r\n    Esalar l'alma; in guisa di Baccante\r\n    Gridando, e percotendosi il bel petto,\r\n    Lasciò cadersi in sul giacente corpo,\r\n    E giunse viso a viso, e bocca a bocca. (V. i.)\r\n\r\nSo too the chorus, though awkward enough from a dramatic point of view\r\nand in so far as it fulfils any dramatic purpose, offers a sufficient\r\njustification for its existence in the magnificent ode on 'honour,' that\r\nrapturous song of the golden age of love, the poetic supremacy of which\r\nhas never been questioned, whatever may have been thought of its ethical\r\nsignificance. To that aspect we shall return later. At present it will be\r\nwell to give some more or less detailed account of the action of the piece\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe shepherd Aminta loves Silvia, formerly as a child his playmate and\r\ncompanion, now a huntress devoted to the service of Diana, proud in her\r\nvirginity and unfettered state. The play opens in a sufficiently\r\nconventional manner, but wrought with sparkling verse, with two companion\r\nscenes. In the first of these Silvia brushes aside the importunities of\r\nher confidant Dafne who seeks to allure her to the blandishments of love\r\nwith sententious natural examples and modern instances.\r\n\r\n    Cangia, cangia consiglio,\r\n    Pazzerella che sei,\r\n    Che il pentirsi dassezzo nulla giova;\r\n\r\nsuch is the burden of her song, or yet again, recalling the golden days of\r\nlove she too of yore had wasted:\r\n\r\n    Il mondo invecchia\r\n    E invecchiando intristisce.\r\n\r\nWords of profound melancholy these, uttered in the days of the burnt-out\r\nfires of the renaissance. But all this moves not Silvia, nymph of the\r\nwoods and of the chase, and, if she is indeed as fancy-free as she would\r\nhave us believe, her lover may even console himself with the reflection\r\nthat\r\n\r\n    If of herself she will not love,\r\n    Nothing will make her--\r\n    The devil take her!\r\n\r\nShe has, after all, every right to the position. The next scene introduces\r\nAminta and his friend Tirsi, to whom he reveals the object and the history\r\nof his love. Translated into bald prose, his confession has no very great\r\ninterest, but it opens with one of those exquisitely pencilled sketches\r\nthat lie scattered throughout the play.\r\n\r\n    All' ombra d' un bel faggio Silvia e Filli\r\n    Sedean un giorno, ed io con loro insieme;\r\n    Quando un' ape ingegnosa, che cogliendo\r\n    Sen giva il mel per que' prati fioriti,\r\n    Alle guance di Fillide volando,\r\n    Alle guance vermiglie come rosa,\r\n    Le morse e le rimorse avidamente;\r\n    Ch' alla similitudine ingannata\r\n    Forse un fior le credette.\r\n\r\nSilvia heals the hurt by whispering over it a charm; and the whole\r\ndescription is instinct with that delicate, soft sentiment of Tasso's\r\nwhich almost, though never quite, sinks into sentimentality. Aminta feigns\r\nto have been stung on the lip, and begs Silvia to heal the hurt.\r\n\r\n    La semplicetta Silvia,\r\n    Pietosa del mio male,\r\n    S' offrì di dar aita\r\n    Alla finta ferita, ahi lasso! e fece\r\n    Più cupa e più mortale\r\n    La mia piaga verace,\r\n    Quando le labbra sue\r\n    Giunse alle labbra mie.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to argue that this is childish, that it mattered no whit though\r\nthey kissed from now to doomsday. But only the reader who cannot feel its\r\nbeauty is safe from the enervating narcotic of Tasso's style.\r\n\r\nThe first scene of the second act introduces a new character, the satyr,\r\ntype of brute nature in the artificially polished Arcadia of courtly\r\nshepherds. He inherits no savoury character from his literary\r\npredecessors, and he is content to play to the rôle. His monologue may be\r\npassed over; it and still more the next scene serve to measure the cynical\r\nindelicacy of feeling which was tolerated in the Italian courts. It is a\r\nquality wholly different from the mere coarseness exhibited in the English\r\ndrama under Elizabeth and James, but it is one which will astonish no one\r\nwho has looked on the dramatic reflection of Italian society in the scenes\r\nof the _Mandragola_. The satyr is succeeded on the stage by the confidants\r\nDafne and Tirsi in consultation as to the means of bringing about an\r\nunderstanding between Aminta and Silvia. The scene is characterized by\r\nthose caustic reflections on women which serve to balance the extravagant\r\niciness of the 'careless' nymphs and became a commonplace of the pastoral\r\ndrama.\r\n\r\n    Or, non sai tu com' è fatta la donna?\r\n    Fugge, e fuggendo vuol ch' altri la giunga;\r\n    Niega, e negando vuol ch' altri si toglia;\r\n    Pugna, e pugnando vuol ch' altri la vinca.\r\n\r\nListening to the deliberations of these two, it cannot but strike us that\r\nin spite of their polished speech the straightforward London stage would\r\nhave hesitated but little to bestow on them the names they deserve, and\r\nwhich it were yet scarce honest to have here set down. We pass on, and,\r\nwhatever may be said regarding the moral atmosphere of the rest of the\r\nplay, we shall not again have to make complaint of the corruption of\r\nmanners assumed in the situation. In the following scene Tirsi undertakes\r\nthe difficult task of inducing Aminta to intrude upon Silvia, where she is\r\nsaid to be alone at the spring preparing for the chase. It is only by\r\nhinting that Silvia has secretly instructed Dafne to arrange the tryst\r\nthat he in the end succeeds in persuading the bashful lover to risk the\r\ndispleasure of his mistress.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of Act III Tirsi enters lamenting in bitter terms the\r\ncruelty of Silvia. Interrogated by the chorus, he relates how, as he and\r\nAminta approached the spring where Silvia was bathing, they heard a cry\r\nand, hastening to the spot, found the nymph bound hand and foot to a tree,\r\nand confronting her the satyr. At their approach the monster fled, and\r\nAminta released the nymph, who _ignuda come nacque_ at once took flight,\r\nleaving her lover in despair. In the meanwhile Aminta has sought to kill\r\nhimself with his own spear, but has been prevented by Dafne, and the two\r\nnow enter. At this moment too comes Nerina, one of the 'messengers' of the\r\npiece, with the news that Silvia has been slain while pursuing a wolf in\r\nthe forest. Thereupon Aminta, with a last reproach to Dafne for having\r\nprevented him from putting an end to his miserable life before being the\r\nrecipient of such direful news, rushes off the scene at a pace to mock\r\npursuit. In the next act, however, Silvia reappears and narrates her\r\nescape. Here we arrive at the dramatic climax of the play. Dafne expresses\r\nher fear that the false report of Silvia's death may indeed prove the\r\ndeath of Aminta. The nymph at first shows herself incredulous, but on\r\nlearning that he had already once sought death on her account she wavers\r\nand owns to pity if not to love--\r\n\r\n              Oh potess' io\r\n    Con l' amor mio comprar la vita sua,\r\n    Anzi pur con la mia la vita sua,\r\n    S' egli è pur morto!\r\n\r\nHereupon Ergasto enters with the news that Aminta has thrown himself from\r\na cliff, and Silvia, now completely overcome, goes off with the intention\r\nof dying on the body of her dead lover.\r\n\r\nThe shortness, as well as the dramatic weakness, of the fifth act is\r\nconspicuous even in proportion to the modest limits of the whole. It runs\r\nto less than one hundred and fifty lines, and merely relates how Aminta's\r\nfall was broken, how Silvia's love awoke, and all ended happily. The most\r\nsignificant passage, that namely which describes Aminta being called back\r\nto life in Silvia's arms, has been already quoted. He revives unharmed,\r\nand the lovers,\r\n\r\n    Alike in age, in generous birth alike\r\n    And mutual desires,\r\n\r\ngather in love the fruits which they have sown in weeping.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while quoting the final chorus in witness of the spirit of\r\nhalf bantering humour in which the whole was conceived even by the serious\r\nTasso, a spirit we unfortunately too often seek in vain among his\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\n    Non so se il molto amaro\r\n    Che provato ha costui servendo, amando,\r\n    Piangendo e disperando,\r\n    Raddolcito esser puote pienamente\r\n    D' alcun dolce presente:\r\n    Ma, se più caro viene\r\n    E più si gusta dopo 'l male il bene,\r\n    Io non ti chieggio, Amore,\r\n    Questa beatitudine maggiore:\r\n    Bea pur gli altri in tal guisa;\r\n    Me la mia ninfa accoglia\r\n    Dopo brevi preghiere e servir breve:\r\n    E siano i condimenti\r\n    Delle nostre dolcezze\r\n    Non sì gravi tormenti,\r\n    Ma soavi disdegni,\r\n    E soavi ripulse,\r\n    Risse e guerre a cui segua,\r\n    Reintegrando i cori, o pace o tregua.\r\n\r\nIt is with these words that the author leaves his graceful fantasy; and\r\nsuch, we have perhaps the right to assume, was the spirit in which the\r\nwhole was composed. Were any one to object to our seeking to analyse the\r\nquality of the piece, arguing that to do so were to break a butterfly upon\r\nthe wheel, much might reasonably be said in support of his view.\r\nNevertheless, when a work of art, however delicate and slender, has\r\nreceived the homage of generations, and influenced cultivated taste for\r\ncenturies, and in widely different countries, we have a right to inquire\r\nwhereon its supremacy is based, and what the nature of its influence has\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nWith the sources from which Tasso drew the various elements of his plot we\r\nneed have little to do. The child-love of Silvia and Aminta is of the\r\nstuff of _Daphnis and Chloe_; the ruse by which the kiss is obtained is\r\nborrowed from Achilles Tatius; the compliment to the court of the Estensi\r\nis after the manner of Vergil, or of Castiglione, or of Ariosto, or of any\r\nother of the allegorical eclogists of whom Vergil was the first; the germ\r\nof the golden-age chorus is to be found in the elegies of Tibullus (II.\r\niii); the character of the satyr belongs to tradition; the rent veil of\r\nSilvia reminds us of that of Ovid's Thisbe (_Met._ IV. 55). The language\r\ntoo is reminiscent. The finest lines in the play--\r\n\r\n    Amiam: che 'l sol si muore, e poi rinasce;\r\n      A noi sua breve luce\r\n      S' asconde, e 'l sonno eterna notte adduce--(_Coro_ I.)\r\n\r\nbelong to Catullus:\r\n\r\n    Viuamus, mea Lesbia, atque amemus;...\r\n    soles occidere et redire possunt;\r\n    nobis cum semel occidit breuis lux,\r\n    nox est perpetua una dormienda. (_Carm._ V.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe words in which Amore describes himself in the prologue--\r\n\r\n              non mica un dio\r\n    Selvaggio, o della plebe degli dei,\r\n    Ma tra' grandi celesti il più possente--\r\n\r\nrecall Ovid's lines:\r\n\r\n    nec de plebe deo, sed qui caelestia magna\r\n    sceptra manu teneo.      (_Met._ I. 595.)\r\n\r\nAgain, the line:\r\n\r\n    Dove la costa face di sè grembo;\r\n\r\nwhich occurs alike in the play (V. i.) and in the _Purgatorio_ (VII. 68),\r\nsupplies evidence, as do similar borrowings in the _Gerusalemme_, of\r\nTasso's study of Dante.\r\n\r\nThe prologue introduces Amore in pastoral disguise, escaped from the care\r\nof his mother, who would confine his activity to the Courts, and intent on\r\nloosing his shafts among the nymphs and shepherds of Arcadia. In the form\r\nof this prologue, which became the model for subsequent pastoral writers\r\nin Italy[173], and in the heavenly descent of the principal characters, we\r\nmay see the influence of the mythological play; while the substance both\r\nof the prologue and of the epilogue, or _Amore fuggitivo_, in which Venus\r\ncomes to seek her runaway among the ladies and gallants of the court, is\r\nof course borrowed from the famous first idyl of Moschus. Again the\r\ntopical element is not absent, though it is less prominent than some of\r\nthe earlier work might lead us to expect. In the poet Tirsi--\r\n\r\n              allor ch' ardendo\r\n    Forsennato egli errò per le foreste\r\n    Sì, ch' insieme movea pietate e riso\r\n    Nelle vezzose ninfe e ne' pastori;\r\n    Nè già cose scrivea digne di riso,\r\n    Sebben cose facea digne di riso--(I. i.)\r\n\r\nwe may, of course, see the poet himself. In Batto too, mentioned together\r\nwith Tirsi, it is not unreasonable to recognize Battisto Guarini, whom at\r\nthat time Tasso might still regard as his friend. Again, it is usual to\r\nidentify Elpino with Giovanbattista Pigna, secretary of state at the\r\nEstense court, and one with whom, though no friend of the poet's, it was\r\nyet to his advantage to stand well. The flattery bestowed is not a little\r\nfulsome:\r\n\r\n              Or non rammenti\r\n    Ciò che l' altrieri Elpino raccontava,\r\n    Il saggio Elpino a la bella Licori,\r\n    Licori che in Elpin puote cogli occhi\r\n    Quel ch' ei potere in lei dovria col canto,\r\n    Se 'l dovere in amor si ritrovasse;\r\n    E 'l raccontava udendo Batto e Tirsi,\r\n    Gran maestri d' amore; e 'l raccontava\r\n    Nell' antro dell' Aurora, ove sull' uscio\r\n    È scritto: _Lungi, ah lungi ite, profani_?\r\n    Diceva egli, e diceva che gliel disse\r\n    Quel grande che cantò l' armi e gli amori,\r\n    Ch' a lui lasciò la fistola morendo;\r\n    Che laggiù nello 'nferno è un nero speco,\r\n    Là dove esala un fumo pien di puzza\r\n    Dalle tristi fornaci d' Acheronte;\r\n    E che quivi punite eternamente\r\n    In tormenti di tenebre e di pianto\r\n    Son le femmine ingrate e sconoscenti. (I. i.)\r\n\r\nHe who sang of arms and love is of course Ariosto--\r\n\r\n    Le donne, i cavalier, l' arme, gli amori,\r\n    Le cortesie, l' audaci imprese io canto--\r\n\r\nfrom whom Tasso borrows the above description of the reward awaiting\r\nungrateful women, as also the fiction of the tell-tale walls and chairs in\r\nMopso's account of the court (I. ii). And this Elpino, whose pipe\r\nelsewhere\r\n\r\n      correr fa di puro latte i fiumi\r\n    E stillar melle dalle dure scorze, (III. i.)\r\n\r\nlater becomes the Alete of the _Gerusalemme_,\r\n\r\n    Gran fabbro di calunnie adorne in modi\r\n    Novi che sono accuse e paion lodi. (II. 58.)\r\n\r\nHis flattery had not shielded the unhappy poet against the ill-will of\r\nthe minister[174].\r\n\r\nAgain, the picture drawn by Tirsi of the ideal court (I. ii.) is a glowing\r\ncompliment to that of the Estensi and to Duke Alfonso himself. It is\r\ncontrasted with the usual pastoral denunciation of court and city put into\r\nthe mouth of the pretended augur Mopso. In this character it has been\r\ncustomary to see Sperone Speroni, who later accused Tasso of plagiarizing\r\nhim in the _Gerusalemme_, and was the first to apply the ominous word\r\n'madman' to the unfortunate poet. To Speroni's play _Canace_ Tasso may\r\nhave been indebted for the free measures with which he diversified his\r\nblank verse, as likewise for the line:\r\n\r\n    Pianti, sospiri e dimandar mercede;[175]\r\n\r\nthough it must not be supposed that there is any resemblance in style\r\nbetween the _Aminta_ and Speroni's revolting and frigid declamation of\r\nbutchery and lust. Nor did the debt pass unnoticed. In 1585 Guarini, who\r\nhad long since parted with the sinking ship of the younger poet's\r\nfriendship, was ready to flatter Speroni with the declaration 'che tanto\r\ndi leggiadria è sempre paruto a me, che abbia nell' Aminta suo conseguito\r\nTorquato Tasso, quant' egli fù imitatore della Canace[176].'\r\n\r\nLastly, in the hopeless suit of Aminta to Silvia, criticism has not failed\r\nto see a reference to the supposed relation between Tasso and Leonora d'\r\nEste. That Tasso, who in his overwrought imagination no doubt harboured a\r\nsentimental regard for the princess, was conscious of the parallel is in\r\nsome degree probable; that he should have identified his creation with\r\nhimself is, in view of the solution of the dramatic situation, utterly\r\nimpossible. Indeed, it would perhaps not be extravagant to suppose that\r\nhis care to identify himself with Aminta's confidant may have been an\r\nunusual but not untimely piece of caution on his part, to prevent poisoned\r\ngossip connecting him too closely with his hero.\r\n\r\nThe question of the influence of the _Aminta_ on later works and on\r\nEuropean thought generally opens up large and difficult issues. It is one\r\nof those works which we are not justified in treating from the purely\r\nliterary point of view. If we wish to see it in its relation to\r\ncontemporary society, and to estimate its influence upon subsequent\r\nliterature, we cannot afford to neglect its ethical bearings. This inquiry\r\nmust necessarily lead us beyond the sphere of literary criticism proper,\r\nbut it is a task which one who has undertaken to give an account of\r\npastoral literature has no right to shirk.\r\n\r\nThe central motive of the piece is the struggle between the feverish\r\npassion of Aminta and the virginal coldness of Silvia. Of this motive and\r\nof the manner in which it is treated it is not altogether easy to speak,\r\nand this less from any inherent element in the subject or from the\r\ndifficulty of accurately apprehending the peculiarities of sentiment\r\nproper to former ages, than from the readiness of all ages alike to accept\r\nin such matters the counterfeit coin of conventional protestation for the\r\nsterling reticence of natural delicacy. No doubt this tendency has been\r\naided by the fact that the secrets of a girl's heart, whatever may be\r\ntheir true dramatic value, form an unsuitable and ineffective subject for\r\ndeclamation. The difficulties must not, however, be allowed to weigh\r\nagainst the importance of coming to a clear understanding as to the true\r\nnature of this _non so che_ of false sentiment, of which it would hardly\r\nbe too much to affirm that it made the fortune of the pastoral in\r\naristocratic Italy on the one hand, and proved its ruin in middle-class\r\nLondon on the other.\r\n\r\nTo Tasso is due that assumption of extravagant and conventional _pudor_\r\nwhich forms one of the most abiding features of the pastoral drama. To\r\ncensure an exaggeration of the charm of modesty on the threshold of the\r\n_seicento_, or to object a strained sense of chastity against the author\r\nof the golden-age chorus, may indeed seem strange; but, as with Fletcher\r\nat a later date, the very extravagance of the paradox may supply us with\r\nthe key to its solution.\r\n\r\nThe falsity of Tasso's position is evinced partly in the main action of\r\nthe drama, partly in the commentary supplied by the minor personages. The\r\ncharacter of Aminta himself is unimportant in this respect; when we have\r\ndescribed him as effeminate, sickly, and over-refined, we have said all\r\nthat is necessary in view of the position he occupies with regard to\r\nSilvia. She, we are given to understand, is the type of the 'careless'\r\nshepherdess, the unspotted nymph of Diana[177], rejoicing in the chase\r\nalone, and importuned by the love of Aminta, which she neither\r\nreciprocates nor understands, and of the genuineness of which she shows\r\nherself, indeed, not a little sceptical. If, however, she is as careless\r\nas she appears, her conversion is certainly most sudden. The picture,\r\nmoreover, drawn by Dafne of Silvia coquetting with her shadow in the pool,\r\nthough possibly coloured by malice, supplies a sufficient hint of the\r\ntrue state of the girl's fancy. She is in truth such a Chloe of innocence\r\nas might spring up in the rank soil of a petty Italian court infected with\r\npost-Tridentine morality. Were she indeed careless of Aminta's devotion we\r\ncould easily sympathize with her when she brushes aside Dafne's\r\nimportunity with the words:\r\n\r\n    Faccia Aminta di sè e de' suoi amori\r\n    Quel ch' a lui piace; a me nulla ne cale. (I. i.)\r\n\r\nIt is altogether different with her attitude of arrogant pudicity when she\r\nannounces:\r\n\r\n              Odio il suo amore\r\n    Ch' odia la mia onestate;    (Ib.)\r\n\r\nand again:\r\n\r\n    In questa guisa gradirei ciascuno\r\n    Insidiator di mia virginitate,\r\n    Che tu dimandi amante, ed io nemico. (Ib.)\r\n\r\nSilvia here conjoins the unwholesome medieval ideal of virginity with the\r\ncorrupt spectre of renaissance 'honour'--\r\n\r\n              quel vano\r\n    Nome senza soggetto,\r\n    Quell' idolo d' errori, idol d' inganno[178], (_Coro_ I.)\r\n\r\nas Tasso himself styled it--that conventional mask so bitterly contrasted\r\nwith the natural goodness of the age of gold[179].\r\n\r\nThe general conception of love and its attendant emotions that permeates\r\nthe work and vitiates so many of its descendants appears yet more\r\nglaringly characterized in some of the minor personages. On these it is\r\nnot my intention to dwell. Of Dafne and Tirsi, that is, be it remembered,\r\nTasso's self, I have spoken, however briefly, yet at sufficient length\r\nalready. Suffice it to add here that Dafne's suggestion, that modesty is\r\ncommonly but a veil for lust, is nothing more than the cynical expression\r\nof the attitude adopted throughout the play. Love is no ideal and\r\nidealizing emotion, but a mere gratification of the senses--a _luxuria_\r\nscarcely distinguishable from _gula_. Ignorance can alone explain an\r\nattitude of indifference towards its pleasures. The girl who does not care\r\nto embrace opportunity is no better than a child--'Fanciulla tanto\r\nsciocca, quanto bella,' as Dafne says. So, again, there is nothing\r\nennobling in the devotion of the hero, nothing elevating in his fidelity.\r\nAll the mysticism, all the ideality, of the early days of the renaissance\r\nhave long since disappeared, and chivalrous feeling, that last lingering\r\nglory of the middle age, is dead.\r\n\r\nWe are, indeed, justified in regarding what I may term the degeneration of\r\nsexual feeling in the _Aminta_ as to a great extent the negation of\r\nchivalrous love, for, even apart from the allegorizing mysticism of Dante,\r\nthat love contained its ennobling elements. And yet, strangely enough, not\r\na little of the convention at least of chivalrous love survives in the\r\ndebased Arcadian love of the sentimental pastoral. Both alike are\r\nprimarily of an animal nature, and this in a sense other than that in\r\nwhich physical love may be said to form an element in all natural relation\r\nbetween man and woman. Again, in both we find the rational machinery by\r\nwhich love shall be rewarded. The lover serves his apprenticeship, either\r\nwith deeds of arms or with sighs and sonnets, and the credit of the\r\nmistress is light who refuses to reward him for his service. The System\r\nassumes neither choice, nor passion, nor pleasure on her part. Her act is\r\nregarded in the cold light of a calculated payment, undisguised by any joy\r\nof passionate surrender. But whereas in the outgrowth of feudalism, in the\r\nchivalry of the middle ages, this system formed the great incentive to\r\nmartial daring, whereas when idealized in Beatrice it became almost\r\nundistinguishable from the ferveurs of religion, we find it with Tasso\r\nsinking into a weak and mawkish sensuality. More than any other\r\nsentimentalist Tasso justified his title by 'fiddling harmonics on the\r\nstrings of sensualism,' and it may be added that the ear is constantly\r\ncatching the fundamental note.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks appeared necessary in order to understand the\r\nsubsequent history of the dramatic pastoral as well as the conditions\r\nunder which it took form and being, but they have led us far beyond the\r\nlimits of literary criticism proper. The next characteristic of the play\r\nto be considered is one which, while possessing an important ethical\r\nbearing, is also closely connected with the aesthetic composition. I refer\r\nto the peculiar, not sensual but sensuous, nature of the beauty. The\r\neffect produced by the descriptions, by the suggestions, by the general\r\ntone, by the subtle modulations of the verse in adaptation to its theme,\r\nis less one of literary and intellectual than of direct emotional\r\nperception, producing the immediate physical impression of an actual\r\npresence. The beauty has a subtle enervating charm, languid and\r\nvoluptuous, at the same time as clear and limpid in tone. The effect\r\nproduced is one and whole, that of a perfect work of art, and the same\r\nimpression remains with us afterwards. Smooth limbs, soft and white, that\r\nshine through the waters of the spring and amid the jewelled spray, or\r\nhalf revealed among the thickets of lustrous green, a slant ray of\r\nsunlight athwart the loosened gold of the hair--the vision floats before\r\nus as if conjured up by the strains of music rather than by actual words.\r\nThis kinship with another art did not escape so acute a critic as Symonds\r\nas a characteristic of Tasso's style. But the kinship on another side with\r\nthe art of painting is equally close; a thousand pictures rise before us\r\nas we follow the perfect melody of the irregular lyric measures. The white\r\nveil fluttering and the swift feet flashing amid the brambles and the\r\ntrailing creepers of the wood, bright crimson staining the spotless purity\r\nof the flying skirts as the huntress bursts through the clinging tangles\r\nthat seek to hold her as if jealous of a human love, the lusty strength of\r\nthe bronzed and hairy satyr in contrast with the tender limbs of the\r\ncaptive nymph, the dark cliff, and the still mirror of the lake reflecting\r\nthe rosebuds pressed artfully against the girl's soft neck as she crouches\r\nby its brink,\r\n\r\n    Backed by the forest, circled by the flowers,\r\n    Bathed in the sunshine of the golden hours,\r\n\r\nthe armed huntress, the grey-coated wolves, and the white-robed\r\nchorus--here are a series of pictures of seductive beauty for the brush of\r\na painter to realize upon the walls of some palace of pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe _Aminta_ attained a wide popularity even before the appearance of the\r\nfirst edition from the Aldine house at Venice early in 1581--the epistle\r\nis dated 1580. The printer of the Ferrarese edition of the same year\r\nremarks: 'Tosto che la Fama ... mi rapportò, che in Venetia si stampava l'\r\nAminta, ... così subito pensai, che quella sola Impressione dovesse essere\r\nben poca per sodisfattione di tanti virtuosi, che sono desiderosi di\r\nvederla alla luce.' A critical edition was prepared at Paris in the middle\r\nof the following century by Egidio Menagio of the Accademia della Crusca,\r\nand dedicated to Maria della Vergna, better known, under her married name\r\nof Madame de la Fayette, as the author of the _Princesse de Clèves_[180].\r\nIn 1693 the play was attacked by Bartolomeo Ceva Grimaldi, Duke of Telese,\r\nin an address read before the Accademia degli Uniti at Naples[181]. He was\r\nanswered before the same society by Francesco Baldassare Paglia, and in\r\n1700 appeared Giusto Fontanini's elaborate defence[182]. To each chapter\r\nof this work is prefixed a passage from Grimaldi's address, which is then\r\nlaboriously refuted. The Duke's attack is puerile cavil, and in spite of\r\nthe reputed ability of its author the defence must be admitted to be much\r\non the same level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe attention which we have bestowed upon the _Aminta_ will allow us to\r\npass more rapidly than would otherwise have been possible over its\r\nsuccessor and rival, the _Pastor fido_. This is due to the fact that the\r\nmoral and artistic environment of the two pieces is much the same, and\r\nfurther, that it is this environment which to a great extent determined,\r\nnot only the individual character of the poems, but likewise the nature of\r\ntheir subsequent influence.\r\n\r\nRecent research has had the effect of dispelling not a few of the\r\ntraditional ideas respecting Guarini's play. Among them is the fable that\r\nit took twenty years to write, which would carry back its inception to\r\ndays before the composition of the _Aminta_. It is now recognized that\r\nnine years is the utmost that can be assigned, letters being extant which\r\nfix the genesis of the play in 1581, or at the earliest in 1580 a year or\r\nso previous to Guarini's departure from Ferrara[183]. Again, it has been\r\nusual to assume that the play was performed as early as 1585, whereas\r\nthere is in truth no evidence of any representation previous to the\r\nappearance of the first edition dated 1590[184]. The early fortunes of the\r\nplay are indeed typical of the ill-success that dogged the author\r\nthroughout life. Though untouched by the tragic misfortunes which lend\r\ninterest to Tasso's career, his lot was at times a hard one and we may\r\nexcuse him if, at the last, he was no less embittered than his younger\r\nrival. He was not cursed, it is true, with Tasso's incurable idealism;\r\nbut, if in consequence he exposed himself less to the buffets of\r\ndisillusionment, he likewise lacked its sustaining and ennobling power.\r\nTasso used the pastoral machinery to idealize the court; Guarini accepted\r\nthe pastoral convention of the superiority of the 'natural' life of the\r\ncountry, and used it as a means of pouring out his bitterness of soul. The\r\n_Aminta_, it should be remembered, was written during a few weeks, months\r\nat most, at a time when Tasso was comparatively fortunate and happy; the\r\n_Pastor fido_ was the ten years' labour of a retired and disappointed\r\ncourtier, whose later days were further embittered by domestic\r\nmisfortunes. In the same way as it was characteristic of Tasso's rosy view\r\nthat no law should be allowed to curb the purity of natural love in his\r\ndream of the ideal age, so it was characteristic of the spirit of his\r\nimitator to seek the ideal in the prudent love that strives towards no\r\ndistant star beyond the bounds of law. And the fact that Guarini saw fit\r\nseriously to oppose a scholastic's moral figment to the poet's age of gold\r\nmay serve as a sufficient measure of the soul of the pedant.\r\n\r\nWhen Battista Guarini[185] entered the service of the Duke of Ferrara in\r\n1567 he was already married and had attained the age of thirty, being\r\nseven years older than Tasso. His duties at court were political, and he\r\nwas employed on several missions of a diplomatic character. There was no\r\nreason whatever, beyond his own perverse ambition, why he should have come\r\ninto rivalry with Tasso, yet he did so both as a writer of verses and as a\r\nhanger-on of court beauties. It is impossible to acquit him of bad taste\r\nin the manner in which he and some at least of his fellow courtiers\r\ntreated the unfortunate poet, and there was certainly bad blood between\r\nthe two soon after the production of the _Aminta_, owing, probably, to the\r\nungenerous remarks passed by Guarini upon the author's indebtedness to\r\nprevious writers. After Tasso's confinement to S. Anna in 1579, Guarini\r\nbecame court poet, and the luckless prisoner was condemned to see his own\r\npoems entrusted to the editorial care of his rival.\r\n\r\nGuarini, however, was not satisfied with the court of Ferrara. His estate\r\nwas reduced by the expenses entailed by his missions as ambassador, for\r\nwhich, like Machiavelli, he appears never to have received adequate\r\nsupplies, and by the continuous litigation in which he involved himself.\r\nHis political imagination, too, had been fired during a stay at Turin with\r\nthe possibilities inherent for Italy in the house of Savoy--an enthusiasm\r\nwhich possibly did not tend to smooth his relations with his own master.\r\nIn 1582 he left Ferrara and the service of Alfonso and retired to his\r\nancestral estates of S. Bellino. Here he devoted himself to the\r\ncomposition of the play he had lately taken in hand, which, in spite of\r\nspasmodic returns to political life not only at the court of the Estensi\r\nbut also at Turin and Florence, forms thenceforward with its many\r\nvicissitudes the central interest of his biography. He survived till 1612,\r\ndying at the age of seventy-four.\r\n\r\nTo do justice to the _Pastor fido_ it would be best to give the story in\r\nthe form of a continuous narrative rather than an analysis of the actual\r\nscenes, since the author's constructive power lay almost wholly in the\r\ninvention of an intricate plot and his weakness in the scenic rendering of\r\nit. His dramatic methods, however, so far elaborated from the simplicity\r\nof Tasso's, had a vast influence over subsequent work, and it is highly\r\nimportant to obtain a clear idea of their nature. We shall, therefore, be\r\ncondemned to follow Guarini, part-way at least, through the stiff\r\nartificiality of his interminable scenes.\r\n\r\nA complicated story which is narrated at length in the course of the play\r\nexplains the peculiar laws of Arcadia on which the plot hinges[186]. These\r\ncomprise an edict of Diana to the effect that any nymph found guilty of a\r\nbreach of faith shall suffer death at the altar unless some one offers to\r\ndie in her place; likewise a custom whereby a nymph between fifteen and\r\ntwenty years of age is annually sacrificed to the goddess. When besought\r\nto release the land from this tribute Diana through her oracle replies:\r\n\r\n    Non avrà prima fin quel che v' offende,\r\n    Che duo semi del ciel congiunga amore;\r\n    E di donna infedel l' antico errore\r\n    L' alta pietà d' un pastor fido ammende.\r\n\r\nThe only two in Arcadia who fulfil the conditions of the oracle are\r\nSilvio, the son of the high priest Montano, and Amarilli, daughter of\r\nTitiro, who have in their veins the blood of Hercules and Pan. These two\r\nhave consequently been betrothed and, being now arrived at marriageable\r\nage, their final union is imminent.\r\n\r\nAt this point the play opens. Silvio cares for nothing but the chase,\r\nregardless alike of his destined bride and of the love borne him by the\r\nnymph Dorinda; Amarilli is seemingly heart-whole, but secretly loves her\r\nsuitor Mirtillo, a stranger in Arcadia, whom, however, she persists in\r\ntreating with coldness in view of the penalty involved by a breach of\r\nfaith. Mirtillo in his turn is loved by Corisca, a wanton nymph who has\r\nlearned the arts of the city, and who is pursued both by Coridone, to whom\r\nshe is formally engaged, but whom she neglects, and by a satyr. Almost\r\nevery character is provided with a confidant: Silvio has Linco; Mirtillo,\r\nErgasto; Dorinda, Lupino; Carino[187], the supposed father of Mirtillo,\r\nhas Uranio; Montano and Titiro act as confidants to one another. The only\r\ncase arguing any dramatic feeling is that in which Amarilli makes a\r\nconfidant of her rival Corisca; while Corisca and the satyr alone among\r\nthe more important characters are left to address the audience directly.\r\nEven the confidants sometimes need confidants in their turn, these being\r\nsupplied by a conveniently ubiquitous chorus.\r\n\r\nIn the first scene of Act I, after the prologue, in which Alfeo rises to\r\npay compliments to Carlo Emanuele and his bride, we are introduced to\r\nSilvio and Linco, who are about to start in pursuit of a savage boar which\r\nhas been devastating the country. Linco taxes his companion with his\r\nneglect of the softer joys of love, to which Silvio replies with\r\nlong-drawn praise of the free life of the woods. The scene is parallel to\r\nthe first of the _Aminta_, and the author has sought here and elsewhere to\r\npoint the contrast. Thus where Tasso wrote:\r\n\r\n    Cangia, cangia consiglio,\r\n    Pazzerella che sei;\r\n    Che il pentirsi dassezzo nulla giova;\r\n\r\nGuarini has:\r\n\r\n    Lascia, lascia le selve,\r\n    Folle garzon, lascia le fere, ed ama.\r\n\r\nIn the next scene, again modelled on the corresponding one in Tasso's\r\nplay, we find Ergasto comforting Mirtillo in his despair at Amarilli's\r\n'cruelty.' Mirtillo has but recently arrived in Arcadia, and is ignorant\r\nof its history and customs, which Ergasto explains at length. The third\r\nscene is devoted to a long monologue by Corisca; the fourth to a\r\nconversation between Montano and Titiro, who discuss the oracles\r\nconcerning the approaching marriage and recount portentous dreams. A\r\nmonologue by the satyr relating his ill-usage at the hands of Corisca,\r\nfollowed by a chorus, ends the first act. The next scene contains the\r\nhistory of Mirtillo's passion as narrated to his confidant. Ergasto has\r\nenlisted the services of Corisca, and the whole paraphernalia of love lead\r\nin the next act to an interview between Mirtillo and Amarilli. The\r\nauthor's dramatic method whereby he presents us with alternate scenes from\r\nthe various threads of the plot will by now be evident to the reader, and\r\nthe remainder may for clearness' sake be thrown into narrative form.\r\n\r\nCorisca, well knowing that it is impossible for Amarilli to show favour to\r\nMirtillo, and hoping to ingratiate herself with him, prevails upon the\r\nnymph to grant her lover a hearing, provided the interview be secret and\r\nshort. During a game of blind man's buff the players suddenly retire,\r\nleaving Mirtillo and Amarilli alone. The interview of course comes to\r\nnothing, but as soon as Mirtillo has left her Amarilli relieves her\r\nfeelings in a monologue confessing her love, which is overheard by\r\nCorisca[188]. Charged with her weakness, she confesses her dislike of the\r\nmarriage with Silvio. Hereupon Corisca conceives a plan for ridding\r\nherself at once of her rival in Mirtillo's affections and of her own\r\naffianced lover. She leads Amarilli to suppose that Silvio is faithless\r\nto his betrothal vow. If Amarilli can prove Silvio guilty she will\r\nherself be free, and she agrees to hide in a recess in a cave where\r\nCorisca alleges that Silvio has an assignation. Next Corisca makes an\r\nappointment to meet her lover Coridone in the same cave, intending that he\r\nand Amarilli shall be surprised together. Finally, in order to obtain a\r\nwitness, she accuses Amarilli to Mirtillo of being faithless, and bids him\r\nwatch the mouth of the cave in which she alleges the nymph has an\r\nassignation with Coridone. This ingenious plan would have succeeded to\r\nperfection but for Mirtillo's precipitancy, for, seeing Amarilli enter the\r\ncave, he at once concludes her guilt and follows her forthwith to wreak\r\nrevenge. At that moment the satyr appears and, misunderstanding some words\r\nof Mirtillo's, proceeds to bar the entrance to the cave with a huge rock,\r\nthinking he is imprisoning Mirtillo and Corisca. He then goes off to\r\ninform the priests of the pollution committed so near their temple. These\r\nenter the cave and apprehend the lovers. Amarilli is at once condemned to\r\ndeath, but Mirtillo thereupon offers himself in her place and, being\r\naccepted by the priests, is kept as a sacrifice, Amarilli being at the\r\nsame time closely guarded lest she should lay violent hands upon herself.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Silvio has been successful in his hunting of the boar,\r\nwhose head he brings home in triumph. There follows an echo-scene, one of\r\nthose toys which, as old as the Greek Anthology, and cultivated in Latin\r\nby Tebaldeo, and in Italian by Poliziano, owed, not indeed their\r\nintroduction, but certainly their great popularity in pastoral, to\r\nGuarini. His example is fairly successful. The echo predicts that the end\r\nof Silvio's 'carelessness' is at hand, when he shall himself break his bow\r\nand follow her who now follows him. The prophecy is quick of fulfilment.\r\nWith a jest he turns to go, when his eye falls on a grey object crouching\r\namong the bushes. He supposes it to be a wolf, and looses an arrow at it.\r\nIt proves, however, to be Dorinda, who has throughout followed his chase\r\ndisguised in the rough wolf-skin coat of a herdsman, and who is now led\r\nfainting on to the scene by Lupino. Silvio is overcome with remorse, and,\r\ncareless alike of his troth to Amarilli and of the fate of Arcadia,\r\ndeclares that thenceforth he will love none but Dorinda, and will die\r\nwith her should his arrow prove fatal. They leave the stage for good--to\r\nget healed and married.\r\n\r\nTo return to the main plot. At sundown Mirtillo is led out to die, and the\r\nsacrifice is about to be performed when his supposed father, an Arcadian\r\nby birth, though he has long lived at Elis, and has just arrived in search\r\nof his foster child, interposes. Explanations ensue, and it gradually\r\nappears that Mirtillo is the eldest son of Montano, washed away in his\r\ncradle by the floods of the Alpheus twenty years before. Thus in the love\r\nbetween him and Amarilli, and in his voluntary sacrifice of himself in her\r\nplace, the oracle is fulfilled, and Arcadia freed from its maiden tribute.\r\nThis seems obvious enough, though it takes the inspiration of a blind\r\nprophet to drive it into the heads of the assembled Arcadians. A final\r\ndifficulty remains--the broken troth. But it so happens that Mirtillo was\r\noriginally named Silvio, so that to 'Silvio' no faith is broken. A\r\ncasuistical reason indeed; but good enough for the purpose. No attempt is\r\nmade to clear Amarilli of the compromising evidence on which she had been\r\ncondemned, but the pair have the favour of the gods, and the chorus makes\r\nno difficulty of chanting the virtue of the bride.\r\n\r\nSuch is Guarini's play; a plot constructed with consummate ingenuity, but\r\npresented with an almost entire lack of dramatic feeling. Almost the whole\r\nof the action takes place off the stage. Silvio and Dorinda leave the\r\nscene apparently for a tragic catastrophe; their subsequent union is only\r\nreported; so is the surprisal of Mirtillo and Amarilli, the scene in which\r\nthe former offers himself as a sacrifice in her place, and their meeting\r\nafter the cloud of death has passed. The solitary scene revealing any real\r\ndramatic power is that between Amarilli and the priest Nicandro, in which\r\nthe girl maintains her innocence. Her terror when confronted with death is\r\ndrawn with some delicacy and pathos, though we sadly miss those poignant\r\ntouches that the English playwrights seem always to have had at command on\r\nsimilar occasions. Her fear of death, however, stands in powerful dramatic\r\ncontrast with the sudden courage she displays when her lover seeks to die\r\nin her place. Guarini was perfectly aware of the value of this contrast,\r\nfor he placed the following lines in the mouth of the _messo_ who reports\r\nthe scene:\r\n\r\n    Or odi maraviglia.\r\n    Quella che fu pur dianzi\r\n    Sì dalla tema del morire oppressa,\r\n    Fatta allor di repente\r\n    A le parole di Mirtillo invitta,\r\n    Con intrepido cor così rispose:\r\n    'Pensi dunque, Mirtillo,\r\n    Di dar col tuo morire\r\n    Vita a chi di te vive?\r\n    O miracolo ingiusto! Su, ministri;\r\n    Su, che si tarda? omai\r\n    Menatemi agli altari.'        (V. ii.)\r\n\r\nAnd yet this dramatic contrast has been wantonly thrown away by the\r\nsubstitution of narrative for representation, less for the sake of a blind\r\nadherence to classical convention, as on account of the author's inability\r\nhonestly to face a powerful situation. The same dramatic incapacity shows\r\nitself in his use of borrowings. It will be sufficient to mention the\r\nsententious words from Ovid (_Amores_, I. viii. 43) placed in the mouth of\r\nthe chorus:\r\n\r\n    Dunque non si dirà donna pudica\r\n    Se non quella che mai\r\n    Non fu sollecitata;      (IV. in.)\r\n\r\nin order to compare them with the use made of the same by Webster when he\r\nmade Vittoria at her trial exclaim:\r\n\r\n    Casta est quam nemo rogavit!--\r\n\r\na comparison which at once reveals the gulf fixed between the clairvoyant\r\ndramatist and the mere pedantic scholar.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the subsequent history of pastoral reminds us that it is quite\r\npossible to underestimate Guarini's merits as a playwright. In the\r\nconstruction of a complicated plot, apart from the dramatic presentation\r\nthereof, he achieved a success not to be paralleled by any previous work\r\nin Italy, for the difference in the titles of the _Aminta_ and the _Pastor\r\nfido_, the one styled _favola_ and the other _tragi-commedia_, indicates a\r\nreal distinction; and Guarini's proud claim to have invented a new\r\ndramatic kind was not wholly unfounded[189]. It was this that caused\r\nSymonds to speak of his play as 'sculptured in pure forms of classic\r\ngrace,' while describing the _Aminta_ as 'perfumed and delicate like\r\nflowers of spring.' And lastly, it was this more elaborately dramatic\r\nquality that was responsible for the far greater influence exercised by\r\nGuarini than by Tasso, both on the subsequent drama of Italy and still\r\nmore on the fortunes of the pastoral in England.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in Amarilli, Guarini created one really dramatic character and\r\ndevoted to it one really dramatic scene. His heroine is probably the best\r\ncharacter to be found in the whole of the pastoral drama, and this simply\r\nbecause there is a reason for her coldness towards the lover, upon her\r\nlove to whom the plot depends. Unless love is to be mutual the motive\r\nforce of the drama fails, and consequently, when nymphs insist on parading\r\ntheir inhuman superiority to the dictates of natural affection, they are\r\nsimply refusing to fulfil their dramatic _raison d'être_. With Amarilli it\r\nis otherwise. She has the right to say:\r\n\r\n    Ama l' onestà mia, s' amante sei; (III. iii.)\r\n\r\nand there is a pathos in the words which the author may not have himself\r\nfully understood; whereas the similar expression of Tasso's Silvia quoted\r\non a previous page is insufferable in its smug self-conceit.\r\n\r\nOf this quality of extravagant virginity noticed as a characteristic of\r\nTasso's play there is on the whole less in the _Pastor fido_. It is also\r\nfreer from the tone of cynical corruption and from improper suggestion.\r\nThese merits are, however, more than counterbalanced in the ethical scale\r\nby the elaboration of the spirit of sentimental sensualism, which becomes\r\nas it were an enveloping atmosphere, and lends an enervating seduction to\r\nthe piece. This spirit, already present in the _Aminta_, reappeared in an\r\nemphasized form in the _Pastor fido_, and attained its height in the\r\nfollowing century in Marino's epic of _Adone_. We find it infusing the\r\nscene of Mirtillo's first meeting with Amarilli, which may be said to set\r\nthe tone of the rest of the poem. Happening to see the nymph at the\r\nOlympian games, Mirtillo at once fell in love and contrived to introduce\r\nhimself in female attire into the company of maidens to which she\r\nbelonged. Here, the proposal being made to hold a kissing match among\r\nthemselves, Amarilli was unanimously chosen judge, and, the contest over,\r\nshe awarded the prize to the disguised youth. The incident owes its\r\norigin, as Guarini's notes point out, to the twelfth Idyl of Theocritus,\r\nand the suggestion of the kissing match is aptly put into the mouth of a\r\ngirl from Megara, where an annual contest of kisses among the Greek youths\r\nwas actually held. Guarini, however, most probably borrowed the episode\r\nfrom the fifth canto of Tasso's _Rinaldo_.\r\n\r\nThe sentimental seductiveness of this and other scenes did not escape\r\nsharp comment in some quarters within a few years of the publication of\r\nthe play. In 1605 Cardinal Bellarmino, meeting Guarini at Rome, told him\r\nplainly that he had done as much harm to morals by his _Pastor fido_ as by\r\ntheir heresies Luther and Calvin had done to religion. Later Janus Nicius\r\nErythraeus, that is Giovanni Vittorio Rossi, in his _Pinacoteca_, compared\r\nthe play to a rock-infested sea full of seductive sirens, in which no\r\nsmall number of girls and wives were said to have made shipwreck. It is at\r\nfirst sight ratifier a severe indictment to bring against Guarini's play,\r\nespecially when we remember that a work of art is more often an index than\r\na cause of social corruption. After what has been said, however, of the\r\nnature of the sentiment both in the _Pastor fido_ and the _Aminta_, the\r\ncharge can hardly be dismissed as altogether unfounded. It is only fair to\r\nadd that very different views have been held with regard to the moral\r\naspect of the play, the theory of its essential healthiness finding an\r\neloquent advocate in Ugo Angelo Canello[190].\r\n\r\nLittle as it became him, Guarini chose to adopt the attitude of a\r\nguardian of morals, and Bellarmino's words clearly possessed a special\r\nsting. This pose was in truth but a part of the general attitude he\r\nassumed towards the author of the _Aminta_. His superficial propriety\r\nauthorized him, in his own eyes, to utter a formal censure upon the\r\namorous dream of the ideal poet. He paid the price of his unwarranted\r\nconceit. Those passages in which he was at most pains to contrast his\r\nethical philosophy with Tasso's imaginative Utopia are those in which he\r\nmost clearly betrayed his own insufferable pedantry; while critics even in\r\nhis own day saw through the unexceptionable morality of his frigid\r\ndeclamations and ruthlessly exposed the sentimental corruption that lay\r\nbeneath. When we compare his parody in the fourth chorus of the _Pastor\r\nfido_ with Tasso's great ode; his sententious 'Piaccia se lice' with\r\nTasso's 'S' ei piace, ei lice'; his utterly banal\r\n\r\n    Speriam: che 'l sol cadente anco rinasce;\r\n      E 'l ciel, quando men luce,\r\n      L' aspettato seren spesso n' adduce,\r\n\r\nwith Tasso's superb, even though borrowed, paganism:\r\n\r\n    Amiam: che 'l sol si muore, e poi rinasce;\r\n      A noi sua breve luce\r\n      S' asconde, e 'l sonno eterna notte adduce--\r\n\r\nwhen we make this comparison we have the spiritual measure of the man. A\r\nsimilar comparison will give us his measure as a poet. Take the graceful\r\nbut over-elaborated picture:\r\n\r\n    Quell' augellin che canta\r\n    Sì dolcemente, e lascivetto vola\r\n    Or dall' abete al faggio,\r\n    Ed or dal faggio al mirto,\r\n    S' avesse umano spirto\r\n    Direbbe: 'Ardo d' amore, ardo d' amore!'\r\n\r\nCompare with this the spontaneous sketch of Tasso:\r\n\r\n    Odi quell' usignuolo\r\n    Che va di ramo in ramo\r\n    Cantando: 'Io amo, io amo!'[191]\r\n\r\nOr again, with the irresistible slyness of the final chorus of the\r\n_Aminta_ already quoted compare the sententious lines with which Guarini\r\nclosed his play:\r\n\r\n    O fortunata coppia,\r\n    Che pianto ha seminato, e riso accoglie!\r\n    Con quante amare doglie\r\n    Hai raddolciti tu gli affetti tuoi!\r\n    Quinci imparate voi,\r\n    O ciechi e troppo teneri mortali,\r\n    I sinceri diletti, e i veri mali.\r\n    Non è sana ogni gioia,\r\n    Nè mal ciò che v' annoia.\r\n    Quello è vero gioire,\r\n    Che nasce da virtù dopo il soffrire.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to come to the conclusion that we are listening in\r\nthe one case to a genuine poet of no common order, in the other to a\r\npoetaster of considerable learning and great ingenuity, who elected to don\r\nthe outward habit of a somewhat hypocritical morality. The effect of the\r\ncontrast is further heightened when we remember that Guarini never for a\r\nmoment doubted that he had far surpassed the work of his predecessor.\r\n\r\nGuarini's comment on the _Aminta_ in his letter to Speroni has been\r\nalready quoted: it does little credit to the writer. Manso, the companion\r\nand biographer of Tasso, records that, the poet being asked by some\r\nfriends what he thought of the _Pastor fido_, a copy of which had lately\r\nfound its way to him at Naples:\r\n\r\n  Et egli, 'Mi piace sopramodo, ma confesso di non saper la cagione perchè\r\n  mi piaccia.' Onde io rispondendogli, 'Vi piacerà per avventura,'\r\n  soggiunsi, 'quel che vi riconoscete del vostro.' Et egli replicò, 'Ne\r\n  può piacere il vedere il suo in man d' altri.'[192]\r\n\r\nGuarini would hardly have acknowledged his indebtedness to Tasso in the\r\nway of art, but he drew on all sources for the incidents of his plot, and,\r\nsince he appears to have valued a reputation for scholarship above one for\r\noriginality, he recorded a fair proportion of his borrowings in his notes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Pastor fido_ was the talk of the Italian Courts even before it was\r\ncompleted. Early in 1584 the heir to the duchy of Mantua, Vincenzo\r\nGonzaga, to whose intercession Tasso later owed his liberty, entreated\r\nGuarini to let him have his already famous pastoral for the occasion of\r\nhis marriage with Eleonora de' Medici. The poet, however, found it\r\nimpossible to complete the work in time, and sent the _Idropica_ instead.\r\nIn the autumn a projected representation of the now completed play came to\r\nnaught. The following year Guarini presented his play to the Duke of\r\nSavoy, and received a gold chain as an acknowledgement. The occasion was\r\nthe entry into Turin of Carlo Emanuele and his bride, Catharine of\r\nAustria, the marriage having taken place at Saragossa some time\r\npreviously. The dedication is recorded on the title-page of the first\r\nedition in words that have not unnaturally been held to imply that the\r\nplay was performed on that occasion.[193] It is clear, however, from\r\ncontemporary documents that this is an error, and, though preparations\r\nwere made in view of a performance at the following carnival, these too\r\nwere abandoned. After this we find mention of preparations made at a\r\nvariety of places, but they never came to anything, and there is reason to\r\nbelieve that some at least were abandoned owing to the opposition of\r\nAlfonso d' Este, who never forgave a courtier who transferred his\r\nallegiance to another prince. In 1591 Vincenzo Gonzaga, now duke, summoned\r\nGuarini to Mantua, and matters advanced as far as a _prova generale_ or\r\ndress rehearsal. The project, however, had once more to be abandoned owing\r\nto the death of Cardinal Gianvincenzo Gonzaga at Rome. We possess the\r\nscheme for the four _intermezzi_ designed for this occasion, representing\r\nthe _Musica della Terra, del Mare, dell' Aria_, and _Celeste_. They were\r\nscenic and musical only, without words. About this time too, that is after\r\nthe appearance of the first edition dated 1590, we have notes of\r\npreparations for several private performances, the ultimate fate of which\r\nis uncertain. The first representation of which there is definite\r\nevidence, though even here details are lacking, took place at Crema in\r\nLombardy in 1596, at the cost of Lodovico Zurla[194]. After this\r\nperformances become frequent, and in 1598, after the death of Alfonso, the\r\nplay was finally produced in state before Vincenzo Gonzaga at Mantua. On\r\nall these occasions we may suppose that other prologues were substituted\r\nfor that addressed to _gran Caterina_ and _magnanimo Carlo_[195].\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Guarini, fearing piracy, had turned his attention to the\r\npublication of his play. He first resolved to submit it to the criticism\r\nof Lionardo Salviati and Scipione Gonzaga, the latter of whom had been a\r\nmember of the unlucky committee for the revision of the _Gerusalemme_.\r\nUnfortunately little or nothing is known as to the criticisms and\r\nrecommendations of these two men. The work finally appeared, as we learn\r\nfrom a letter of the author, at Venice in December, 1589. It is a handsome\r\nquarto from the press of Giovanbattista Bonfadino, and is dated the\r\nfollowing year[196]. In 1602 a luxurious edition, said on the title-page\r\nto be the twentieth, was issued at Venice by Giovanbattista Ciotti. This\r\nrepresents Guarini's final revision of the text, and contains, besides a\r\nportrait and engravings, elaborate notes by the author, and an essay on\r\ntragi-comedy[197].\r\n\r\nThe _Pastor fido_ was the object of a violent attack while as yet it\r\ncirculated in manuscript only. As early as 1587 a certain Giasone de Nores\r\nor Denores, a Cypriot noble who held the chair of moral philosophy at the\r\nuniversity of Padua, published a pamphlet on the relations existing\r\nbetween different forms of literature and the philosophy of government, in\r\nwhich, while refraining from any specific allusions, he denounced\r\ntragi-comedies and pastorals as 'monstrous and disproportionate\r\ncompositions ... contrary to the principles of moral and civil\r\nphilosophy.' Guarini argued that, as his play was the only one deserving\r\nto be called a tragi-comedy and was at the same time a pastoral, the\r\nreference was palpable. He proceeded therefore to compose a counterblast\r\nwhich he named _Il Verato_ (1588) after a well-known comic actor of the\r\ntime, who, it may be remarked, had had the management of Argenti's\r\n_Sfortunato_ in 1567. In this pamphlet Guarini traversed the professor's\r\npropositions with a good deal of scholastic ergotism: 'As in compounds the\r\nhot accords with the cold, its mortal enemy, as the dry humour with the\r\nmoist, so the elements of tragedy and comedy, though separately\r\nantagonistic, yet when united in a third form,' _et cetera et cetera_. De\r\nNores replied in an _Apologia_ (1590), disclaiming all personal allusion,\r\nand the poet finally answered back in a _Verato secondo_, first published\r\nin 1593, after his antagonist's death, restating his arguments and\r\nseasoning them with a good deal of unmannerly abuse. These two treatises\r\nof Guarini's were reprinted with alterations as the _Compendio della\r\npoesia tragicommica_, in the 1602 edition of the play, and together with\r\nthe notes to the same edition form Guarini's own share of the\r\ncontroversy[198]. But in 1600, before these had appeared, a Paduan,\r\nFaustino Summo, published a set attack on and dissection of the play;\r\nwhile a certain Giovan Pietro Malacreta of Vicenza illustrated the\r\nattitude of the age with regard to literature by putting forward a series\r\nof critical _dubbî_, that is, doubts as to the 'authority' of the form\r\nemployed. Both works are distinguished by a spirit of puerile cavil, which\r\nwould of itself almost suffice to reconcile us to the worst faults of the\r\npoet. Thus Malacreta is not even content to let the author choose his own\r\ntitle, arguing that Mirtillo was faithful not in his quality of shepherd\r\nbut of lover[199]. He goes on to complain of the tangle of laws and\r\noracles which Guarini invents in order to motive the action of his play;\r\nand here, though taken individually his objections may be hypercritical,\r\nhe has laid his finger on a very real weakness of the author's ingenious\r\nplot. It is, moreover, a weakness common to almost the whole tribe of the\r\nArcadian, or rather Utopian, pastorals. Apologists soon appeared, and had\r\nlittle difficulty in disposing of most of the adverse criticisms. A\r\nspecific _Risposta_ to Malacreta appeared at Padua in 1600 from the pen of\r\nPaolo Beni. Defences by Giovanni Savio and Orlando Pescetti were printed\r\nat Venice and Verona respectively in 1601, while one at least, written by\r\nGauges de Gozze of Pesaro, under the pseudonym of Fileno di Isauro,\r\ncirculated in manuscript. These writings, however, are marked either by\r\nfutile endeavours to reconcile the _Pastor fido_ with the supposed\r\nteaching of Aristotle and Horace, or else by such extravagant laudation as\r\nthat of Pescetti, who doubted not that had Aristotle known Guarini's play,\r\nit would have been to him the model of a new kind to rank with the epic of\r\nHomer and the tragedy of Sophocles[200]. Finally, Summo returned to the\r\ncharge with a rejoinder to Pescetti and Beni printed at Vicenza in\r\n1601[201]. But all this writing and counter-writing in no way affected the\r\npopularity of the _Pastor fido_ and its successors. Moreover, the critical\r\nposition of the combatants on both sides was essentially false. It would\r\nbe an easy task to fill a volume with strictures on the play touching its\r\nsentimental tone, its affected manners, its stiff development, its\r\nundramatic construction, the weak drawing of character, the lack of motive\r\nforce to move the complex machinery, and many other points--strictures\r\nthat should be unanswerable. But those who wish to understand the\r\ninfluence exercised by the play over subsequent literature in Europe will\r\nfind their time better spent in analysing those qualities, whether\r\nemotional or artistic, which won for it the enthusiastic worship of the\r\ncivilized world.\r\n\r\nNumerous translations bear witness to its popularity far beyond the shores\r\nof Italy. The earliest of these was into French, and appeared in 1595; it\r\nwas followed by several others. The Spanish versions have already been\r\nmentioned, and the English will occupy our attention shortly. Besides\r\nthese there are versions, often more than one, in German, Greek, Swedish,\r\nDutch, and Polish. There are likewise versions in the Bergamasc and\r\nNeapolitan dialects, while the manuscript of a Latin translation is\r\npreserved in the University Library at Cambridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were obvious advantages in treating the two masterpieces of pastoral\r\ndrama in Italy in close connexion with one another. It must not, however,\r\nbe supposed that they stood alone in the field of pastoral composition.\r\nBoth between the years 1573 when the _Aminta_ was composed and 1590 when\r\nthe _Pastor fido_ was printed, and also after the latter year, the stream\r\nof plays continued unchecked, though, apart from a general tendency\r\ntowards greater regularity of dramatic construction, they do not form any\r\norganic link in the chain of artistic development. Few deserve more than\r\npassing notice. In the earlier ones, at least, we still find a tendency to\r\nintroduce extraneous elements. Thus _Gl' Intricati_, printed in 1581, and\r\nacted a few years before at Zara, the work of Count Alvise, or, it would\r\nappear, more correctly Luigi, Pasqualigo, contains a farcical and magical\r\npart combined with some rather coarse jesting between two rogues, one\r\nSpanish and one Bolognese, who speak in their respective dialects. Another\r\nplay in which a comic element appears is Bartolommeo Rossi's _Fiammella_\r\n(1584), which has the further peculiarity of introducing allegorical\r\ncharacters into the prologue, and mythological into the play. Another\r\npiece belonging to this period is the _Pentimento amoroso_ by Luigi Groto,\r\nwhich was printed as early as 1575. It is a wild tale of murder and\r\nintrigue, judgement and outrageous self-sacrifice, composed in\r\n_sdrucciolo_ verse and speeches of monstrous length. Another piece,\r\nGabriele Zinano's _Caride_, surreptitiously printed in 1582, and included\r\nin an authorized publication in 1590, has the peculiarity of placing the\r\nprologue in the mouth of Vergil. Lastly, I may mention Angelo Ingegneri's\r\n_Danza di Venere_, acted at Parma in 1583, and printed the following year.\r\nIt contains the incident of a mad shepherd's regaining his wits through\r\ngazing on the beauty of a sleeping nymph, thus borrowing the motive of\r\nBoccaccio's tale of Cymon and Iphigenia. Its chief interest for us,\r\nhowever, lies in the episode of the hero employing a gang of satyrs to\r\ncarry off his beloved during a solemn dance in honour of Venus. This looks\r\nlike a reminiscence of Giraldi Cintio's _Egle_, and through it of the old\r\nsatyric drama[202].\r\n\r\nThese plays all belong to the period between the _Aminta_ and the _Pastor\r\nfido_. Tasso's and Guarini's masterpieces mark the point of furthest\r\ndevelopment attained by the pastoral drama in Italy, or indeed in Europe.\r\nWith them the vitality which rendered evolution possible was spent, though\r\nthe power of reproduction remained unimpaired for close on a century.\r\nSignor Rossi, in the monograph of which I have already made such free use,\r\nmentions a number of plays, whose dependence on the _Pastor fido_ is\r\nevident from their titles, though Guarini's influence is, of course, far\r\nmore widely spread than such eclectic treatment reveals. The most curious,\r\nperhaps, is a play, _I figliuoli di Aminta e Silvia e di Mirtillo ed\r\nAmarilli_, by Ercole Pelliciari, dealing with the fortunes of the children\r\nof the heroes and heroines of Tasso and Guarini. We are on the way to a\r\ngenealogical cycle of Arcadian drama, similar to the cycles of romance\r\nthat centred round Roland and Launcelot. It would be a work of\r\nsupererogation to demonstrate in detail the influence exercised by Tasso\r\nand Guarini over their Italian followers, and a task of forbidding\r\nproportions to give the bare titles of the plays that witnessed to that\r\ninfluence. Serassi reports that in 1614 Clementi Bartoli of Urbino\r\npossessed no less than eighty pastoral plays; while by 1700, the year of\r\nFontanini's work on the _Aminta_, Giannantonio Moraldi is said to hsve\r\nbrought together in Rome a collection of over two hundred.[203] Every\r\ndevice was resorted to that could lend novelty to the scenes; in Carlo\r\nNoci's _Cintia_ (1594) the heroine returns home disguised as a boy to find\r\nher lover courting another nymph; in Francesco Contarini's _Finta\r\nFiammetta_ (1610), on the other hand, the plot turns on the courtship of\r\nDelfide by her lover Celindo in girl's attire; while in Orazio Serono's\r\n_Fida Armilla_ (1610) we have the annual human sacrifice to a monstrous\r\nserpent--all of which later became familiar themes in pastoral drama and\r\nromance. Two plays only call for closer attention, and this rather on\r\naccount of a certain reputation they have gained than of any intrinsic\r\nmerit. One of these, Antonio Ongaro's _Alceo_, which was printed in 1582\r\nand is therefore earlier than the _Pastor fido_, has been happily\r\nnicknamed _Aminta bagnato_. It is a piscatorial adaptation of Tasso's\r\nplay, which it follows almost scene for scene. The satyr becomes a triton\r\nwith as little change of character as the nymphs and shepherds undergo in\r\ntheir metamorphosis to fisher girls and boys. Alceo shows less\r\nresourcefulness than his prototype in that he twice tries to commit\r\nsuicide by throwing himself into the sea. The last act is spun out to\r\nthree scenes in accordance with the demand for greater regularity of\r\ndramatic construction, but gains nothing but tedium thereby. The other\r\nplay to be considered connects itself in plot rather with the _Pastor\r\nfido_. It is the _Filli di Sciro_, the work of Guidubaldo Bonarelli della\r\nRovere. The poet's father enjoyed the protection of the Duke Guidubaldo II\r\nof Urbino, but in after days he removed to the court of the Estensi at\r\nFerrara. It was here that the play appeared in 1607, though it is\r\ndedicated to Francesco Maria della Rovere, who had by that time succeeded\r\nhis father in the duchy of Urbino. The plot of the play is highly\r\nintricate, and shows a tendency towards the introduction of an adventurous\r\nelement; it turns upon the tribute of youths and maidens exacted from the\r\nisland of Scyros by the king of Thrace. The figure of the satyr is\r\nreplaced by a centaur who carries off one of the nymphs. Her cries attract\r\ntwo youths who succeed in driving off the monster, but are severely\r\nwounded in the encounter. The nymph, Celia, thereupon falls in love with\r\nboth her rescuers at once, and it is only when one of them proves to be\r\nher long-lost brother that she is able to make up her mind between\r\nthem[204]. This brother had been carried off as a child by the Thracians\r\ntogether with his betrothed Filli, and having escaped was lately returned\r\nto his native land. From a dramatic point of view the _dénoûment_ is even\r\nmore preposterous than usual. The principal characters leave the stage at\r\nthe end of the fourth act, under sentence of death, and do not reappear,\r\nthe whole of the last act being occupied with narratives of their\r\nsubsequent fortunes. A point which is possibly worth notice is the\r\nintroduction of that affected talk on the technicalities of sheepcraft\r\nwhich adds so greatly to the already intolerable artificiality of the\r\nlater pastoral drama, but which is happily absent from the work of Tasso\r\nand Guarini.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the end of our survey of the Italian pastoral drama.\r\nIn spite of the space it has been necessary to devote to the subject, it\r\nmust be borne in mind that we have treated it from one point of view only.\r\nBesides the interest which it possesses in connexion with the development\r\nof pastoral tradition, it also plays a very important part in the history\r\nof dramatic art, not in Italy alone, but over the whole of Europe. On this\r\naspect of the subject we have hardly so much as touched. Nor is this all.\r\nIf it is true, as is commonly assumed, that the opera had its birth in the\r\n_Orfeo_ of Angelo Poliziano, it is not less true that it found its cradle\r\nin the Arcadian drama. A few isolated pieces may still be able to charm us\r\nby their poetic beauty. In dealing with the rest it must never be\r\nforgotten that without the costly scenery and elaborate musical setting\r\nthat lent body and soul to them in their day, we have what is little\r\nbetter than the dry bones of these _ephemeridae_ of courtly art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\n\r\nDramatic Origins of the English Pastoral Drama\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving at length arrived at what must be regarded as the main subject of\r\nthis work, it will be my task in the remaining chapters to follow the\r\ngrowth of the pastoral drama in England down to the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century, and in so doing to gather up and weave into a\r\nconnected web the loose threads of my discourse.\r\n\r\nTaking birth among the upland meadows of Sicily, the pastoral tradition\r\nfirst assumed its conventional garb in imperial Rome, and this it\r\npreserved among learned writers after its revival in the dawn of the\r\nItalian renaissance. With Arcadia for its local habitation it underwent a\r\nrebirth in the opening years of the sixteenth century in Sannazzaro's\r\nromance, and again towards the close in the drama of Tasso. It became\r\nchivalric in Spain and courtly in France, and finally reached this country\r\nin three main streams, the eclogue borrowed by Spenser from Marot, the\r\nromance suggested to Sidney by Montemayor, and the drama imitated by\r\nDaniel from Tasso and Guarini. Once here, it blended variously with other\r\ninfluences and with native tradition to produce a body of dramatic work,\r\nwhich, ill-defined, spasmodic and occasional, nevertheless reveals on\r\ninspection a certain character of its own, and one moreover not precisely\r\nto be paralleled from the literary annals of any other European nation.\r\n\r\nThe indications of a native pastoral impulse, manifesting itself in the\r\nburlesque of the religions drama and the romance of the popular ballads,\r\nwe have already considered. The connexion which it is possible to trace\r\nbetween this undefined impulse and the later pastoral tradition is in no\r\nwise literary; in so far as it exists at all and is one of temperament\r\nalone, a bent of national character. In tracing the rise of the form in\r\nItaly upon the one hand, and in England upon the other, we are struck by\r\ncertain curious contrasts and also by certain curious parallelisms. The\r\nclosest analogy to the ballad themes to be discovered in the literature of\r\nItaly is in certain of the songs of Sacchetti and his contemporaries, but\r\nit would be unwise to insist on the resemblance. The more suggestive\r\nparallel of the _novelle_ has to be ruled out on the score of form, and is\r\nfurther differentiated by the notable lack in them of romantic spirit.\r\nAgain, in the _sacre rappresentazioni_, the burlesque interpolations from\r\nactual life, which with us aided the genesis of the interlude, and through\r\nit of the romantic comedy, are as a rule so conspicuously absent that the\r\nrustic farce with which one nativity play opens can only be regarded as a\r\ndirect and conscious imitation from the French. It is, on the other hand,\r\na remarkable fact, and one which, in the absence of any evidence of direct\r\nimitation,[205] must be taken to indicate a real parallelism in the\r\nevolution of the tradition in the two countries, that in England as in\r\nItaly the way was paved for pastoral by the appearance of mythological\r\nplays, introducing incidentally pastoral scenes and characters, and\r\nanticipating to some extent at any rate the peculiar atmosphere of the\r\nArcadian drama.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe earliest of these English mythological plays, alike in date of\r\nproduction and of publication, was George Peele's _Arraignment of Paris_,\r\n'A Pastorall. Presented before the Queenes Majestie, by the children of\r\nher Chappell,' no doubt in 1581, and printed three years later.[206] It\r\npartakes of the nature of the masque in that the whole composition centres\r\nround a compliment to the Queen, Eliza or Zabeta--a name which, as Dr.\r\nWard notes, Peele probably borrowed along with one or two other hints from\r\nGascoigne's Kenilworth entertainment of 1575. The title sufficiently\r\nexpresses its mythological character, and the precise value of the term\r\n'pastoral' on the title-page is difficult to determine. The characters are\r\nfor the most part either mythological or rustic; the only truly pastoral\r\nones being Paris and Oenone, whose parts, however, in so far as they are\r\npastoral, are also of the slightest. It is of course impossible to say\r\nexactly to what extent the fame of the Italian pastoral drama may have\r\npenetrated to England--the _Aminta_ was first printed the year of the\r\nproduction of Peele's play, and waited a decade before the first English\r\ntranslation and the first English edition appeared[207]--but no influence\r\nof Tasso's masterpiece can be detected in the _Arraignment_; still less is\r\nit possible to trace any acquaintance with Poliziano's work.\r\n\r\nAfter a prologue, in which Atè foretells in staid and measured but not\r\nunpleasing blank verse the fall of Troy, the silvan deities, Pan, Faunus,\r\nSilvanus, Pomona, Flora, enter to welcome the three goddesses who are on\r\ntheir way to visit 'Ida hills,' and who after a while enter, led by Rhanis\r\nand accompanied by the Muses, whose processional chant heralds their\r\napproach. They are greeted by Pan, who sings:\r\n\r\n    The God of Shepherds, and his mates,\r\n    With country cheer salutes your states,\r\n    Fair, wise, and worthy as you be,\r\n    And thank the gracions ladies three\r\n      For honour done to Ida.\r\n\r\nWhen these have retired from the stage there follows a charming idyllic\r\nscene between the lovers Paris and Oenone, which contains the delightful\r\nold song, one of the lyric pearls of the Elizabethan drama:\r\n\r\n    _Oenone._ Fair and fair, and twice so fair,\r\n        As fair as any may be;\r\n      The fairest shepherd on our green,\r\n        A love for any lady.\r\n\r\n    _Paris._ Fair and fair, and twice so fair,\r\n        As fair as any may be;\r\n      Thy love is fair for thee alone,\r\n        And for no other lady.\r\n\r\n    _Oenone._ My love is fair, my love is gay,\r\n      As fresh as bin the flowers in May,\r\n      And of my love my roundelay,\r\n      My merry, merry, merry roundelay,\r\n        Concludes with Cupid's curse--\r\n      They that do change old love for new,\r\n        Pray gods they change for worse!\r\n\r\n    _Both._ They that do change old love for new,\r\n      Pray gods they change for worse!\r\n\r\nThe second act presents us the three goddesses who have come to Ida on a\r\nparty of pleasure with no very definite object in view, and are now\r\nengaged in exercising their tongues at one another's expense. The scene\r\nconsists of a cross-fire of feminine amenities, not of the most delicate,\r\nit is true, and therefore not here to be reproduced, yet of a keenness of\r\ntemper and a ringing mastery in the rimed verse little less than brilliant\r\nin themselves, and little less than a portent at the date of their\r\nappearance. Then a storm arises, during which, the goddesses having sought\r\nrefuge in Diana's bower, Atè rolls the fatal ball upon the stage. On the\r\nreturn of the three the inscription _Detur pulcherrimae_ breeds fresh\r\nstrife, until they agree to submit the case for judgement to the next man\r\nthey meet. Paris arriving upon the scene at this point is at once called\r\nupon to decide the rival claims of the contending goddesses. First Juno\r\npromises wealth and empery, and presents a tree hung as with fruit with\r\ncrowns and diadems, all which shall be the meed of the partial judge.\r\nPallas next seeks to allure the swain with the pomp and circumstance of\r\nwar, and conjures up a show in which nine knights, no doubt the nine\r\nworthies, tread a 'warlike almain.' Last Venus speaks:\r\n\r\n    Come, shepherd, come, sweet shepherd, look on me,\r\n    These bene too hot alarums these for thee:\r\n    But if thou wilt give me the golden ball,\r\n    Cupid my boy shall ha't to play withal,\r\n    That whenso'er this apple he shall see,\r\n    The God of Love himself shall think on thee,\r\n    And bid thee look and choose, and he will wound\r\n    Whereso thy fancy's object shall be found.\r\n\r\nWhereupon 'Helen entereth in her bravery' attended by four Cupids, and\r\nsinging an Italian song which has, however, little merit. As at a later\r\nday Faustus, so now Paris bows before the sovereignty of her beauty, and\r\nthen wanders off through Ida glades in the company of the victorious queen\r\nof love, leaving her outraged rivals to plot a common revenge. Act III\r\nintroduces the slight rustic element. Hobbinol, Diggon, and Thenot enter\r\nto Colin, who is lamenting the cruelty of his love Thestylis. The names\r\nare obviously borrowed from the _Shepherd's Calender_, but while Colin is\r\nstill the type of the hopeless lover, there is no necessity to suspect any\r\npersonal identification. The _Arraignment_ was probably produced less than\r\ntwo years after the publication of Spenser's eclogues, and Peele, who was\r\nan Oxford man, may even have been ignorant of their authorship[208]. Still\r\nmore unnecessary are certain other identifications between characters in\r\nthe play and persons at court which have been propounded. Such\r\nidentifications, at any rate, have no importance for our present task,\r\nwhich is to ascertain in what measure and in what manner Peele's work\r\npaved the way for the advent of the Italian pastoral; and we note, with\r\nregard to the present scene, that the more polished and more homely\r\nelements alike--both Colin on the one hand, and Diggon, Hobbinol, and the\r\nrest on the other--are inspired by Spenser's work, and by his alone.\r\nMeanwhile Oenone enters, lamenting her desertion by Paris. There is\r\ndelicate pathos in the reminiscence of her former song which haunts the\r\noutpouring of her grief--\r\n\r\n    False Paris, this was not thy vow, when thou and I were one,\r\n    To range and change old loves for new; but now those days be gone.\r\n\r\nShe is less happy in a set lament, beginning:\r\n\r\n    Melpomene, the Muse of tragic songs,\r\n\r\nin which we may perhaps catch a distant echo of Spenser's:\r\n\r\n    Melpomene, the mournfull'st Muse of nine.\r\n\r\nAs she ends she is accosted by Mercury, who has been sent to summon Paris\r\nto appear at Juno's suit before the assembly of the gods on a charge of\r\npartiality in judgement. A pretty dialogue ensues in broken fourteeners,\r\nin which the subtle god elicits a description of the shepherd from the\r\nunsuspecting nymph--it too contains some delicate reminiscences of the\r\nlover's duet.\r\n\r\n    _Mercury._ Is love to blame?\r\n\r\n    _Oenone._    The queen of love hath made him false his troth.\r\n\r\n    _Mer._ Mean ye, indeed, the queen of love?\r\n\r\n    _Oen._             Even wanton Cupid's dame.\r\n\r\n    _Mer._ Why, was thy love so lovely, then?\r\n\r\n    _Oen._            His beauty height his shame;\r\n            The fairest shepherd on our green.\r\n\r\n    _Mer._              Is he a shepherd, than?\r\n\r\n    _Oen._ And sometime kept a bleating flock.\r\n\r\n    _Mer._              Enough, this is the man.\r\n\r\nIn the next scene we find Paris and Venus together. First the goddess\r\ndirects the assembled shepherds to inscribe the words, 'The love whom\r\nThestylis hath slain,' as the epitaph of the now dead Colin. When these\r\nhave left the stage she turns to Paris:\r\n\r\n    Sweet shepherd, didst thou ever love?\r\n\r\n    _Paris._               Lady, a little once.\r\n\r\nShe then warns him against the dangers of faithlessness in a passage which\r\nis a good example of Peele's use of the old rimed versification, and as\r\nsuch deserves quotation.\r\n\r\n      My boy, I will instruct thee in a piece of poetry,\r\n      That haply erst thou hast not heard: in hell there is a tree,\r\n      Where once a-day do sleep the souls of false forsworen lovers,\r\n      With open hearts; and there about in swarms the number hovers\r\n      Of poor forsaken ghosts, whose wings from off this tree do beat\r\n      Round drops of fiery Phlegethon to scorch false hearts with heat.\r\n      This pain did Venus and her son entreat the prince of hell\r\n      T'impose on such as faithless were to such as loved them well:\r\n      And, therefore, this, my lovely boy, fair Venus doth advise thee,\r\n      Be true and steadfast in thy love, beware thou do disguise thee;\r\n      For he that makes but love a jest, when pleaseth him to start,\r\n      Shall feel those fiery water-drops consume his faithless heart.\r\n\r\n    _Paris._ Is Venus and her son so full of justice and severity?\r\n\r\n    _Venus._ Pity it were that love should not be linkèd with indifferency.[209]\r\n\r\nThen follow Colin's funeral, the punishment of the hard-hearted Thestylis,\r\ncondemned to love a 'foul crooked churl' who 'crabbedly refuseth her,'\r\nand the scene in which Mercury summons Paris before the Olympian tribunal.\r\nHere we find him in the next act. The gods being seated in the bower of\r\nDiana, Juno and Pallas, and Venus and Paris appear 'on sides' before the\r\nthrone of Jove, and in answer to his indictment the shepherd of Ida\r\ndelivers a spirited speech. Again the verse is of no small merit.\r\nDefending himself from the charge of partiality in the bestowal of the\r\nprize, he argues:\r\n\r\n    Had it been destinèd to majesty--\r\n    Yet will I not rob Venus of her grace--\r\n    Then stately Juno might have borne the ball.\r\n    Had it to wisdom been intitulèd,\r\n    My human wit had given it Pallas then.\r\n    But sith unto the fairest of the three\r\n    That power, that threw it for my farther ill,\r\n    Did dedicate this ball--and safest durst\r\n    My shepherd's skill adventure, as I thought,\r\n    To judge of form and beauty rather than\r\n    Of Juno's state or Pallas' worthiness--...\r\n    Behold, to Venus Paris gave the fruit,\r\n    A daysman[210] chosen there by full consent,\r\n    And heavenly powers should not repent their deeds.\r\n\r\nAfter consultation the gods decide to dismiss the prisoner, though we\r\ngather that he is not wholly acquitted.\r\n\r\n    _Jupiter._ Shepherd, thou hast been heard with equity and law,\r\n    And for thy stars do thee to other calling draw,\r\n    We here dismiss thee hence, by order of our senate;\r\n    Go take thy way to Troy, and there abide thy fate.\r\n\r\n    _Venus._ Sweet shepherd, with such luck in love, while thou dost live,\r\n    As may the Queen of Love to any lover give.\r\n\r\n    _Paris._ My luck is loss, howe'er my love do speed:\r\n    I fear me Paris shall but rue his deed.\r\n\r\n    _Apollo._ From Ida woods now wends the shepherd's boy,\r\n    That in his bosom carries fire to Troy.\r\n\r\nThis, however, does not settle the case, and the final adjudication of the\r\napple of beauty is entrusted by the gods to Diana, since it was in her\r\ngrove that it was found. Parting company with classical legend in the\r\nincident which gives its title to the play, Peele further adds a fifth\r\nact, in which he contrives to make the world-famous history subserve the\r\ncourtly ends of the masque. When the rival claimants have solemnly sworn\r\nto abide by the decision of their compeer, Diana begins:\r\n\r\n    It is enough; and, goddesses, attend.\r\n    There wons within these pleasaunt shady woods,\r\n    Where neither storm nor sun's distemperature\r\n    Have power to hurt by cruel heat or cold, ...\r\n    Far from disturbance of our country gods,\r\n    Amid the cypress springs[211], a gracions nymph,\r\n    That honours Dian for her chastity,\r\n    And likes the labours well of Phoebe's groves;\r\n    The place Elizium hight, and of the place\r\n    Her name that governs there Eliza is,\r\n    A kingdom that may well compare with mine,\r\n    An auncient seat of kings, a second Troy,\r\n    Y-compass'd round with a commodious sea.\r\n\r\nThe rest may be easily imagined. The contending divinities resign their\r\nclaims:\r\n\r\n    _Venus._ To this fair nymph, not earthly, but divine,\r\n    Contents it me my honour to resign.\r\n\r\n    _Pallas._ To this fair queen, so beautiful and wise,\r\n    Pallas bequeaths her title in the prize.\r\n\r\n    _Juno._ To her whom Juno's looks so well become,\r\n    The Queen of Heaven yields at Phoebe's doom.\r\n\r\nThe three Fates now enter, and singing a Latin song lay their 'properties'\r\nat the feet of the queen. Then each in turn delivers a speech appropriate\r\nto her character, and finally Diana 'delivereth the ball of gold into the\r\nQueen's own hands,' and the play ends with a couple of doggerel hexameters\r\nchanted by way of epilogue by the assembled actors:\r\n\r\n    Vive diu felix votis hominumque deumque,\r\n    Corpore, mente, libro, doctissima, candida, casta.\r\n\r\nThe jingle of these lines would alone suffice to prove that Peele's ear\r\nwas none of the most delicate, and he particularly sins in disregarding\r\nthe accent in the rime-word, a peculiarity which may have been noticed\r\neven in the short passages quoted above. Nevertheless, even apart from its\r\nlyrics, one of which is in its way unsurpassed, the play contains passages\r\nof real grace in the versification. The greater part is written either in\r\nfourteeners or in decasyllabic couplets with occasional alexandrines, in\r\nboth of which the author displays an ease and mastery which, to say the\r\nleast, were uncommon in the dramatic work of the early eighties; while the\r\npassages of blank verse introduced at important dramatic points, notably\r\nin Paris' defence and in Diana's speech, are the best of their kind\r\nbetween Surrey and Marlowe. The style, though now and again clumsy, is in\r\ngeneral free from affectation except for an occasional weakness in the\r\nshape of a play upon words. Such is the connexion of Eliza with Elizium,\r\nin a passage already quoted, and the time-honoured _non Angli sed\r\nangeli_--\r\n\r\n    Her people are y-clepèd Angeli,\r\n    Or, if I miss, a letter is the most--\r\n\r\noccurring a few lines later; also the words of Lachesis:\r\n\r\n    Et tibi, non aliis, didicerunt parcere Parcae.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the general construction of the piece it is hardly too much\r\nto say that the skill with which the author has enlarged a masque-subject\r\ninto a regular drama, altered a classical legend to subserve a particular\r\naim, and conducted throughout the multiple perhaps rather than complex\r\nthreads of his plot, mark him out as pre-eminent among his contemporaries.\r\nWe must not, it is true, look for perfect balance of construction, for\r\nadequacy of dramatic climax, or for subtle characterization; but what has\r\nbeen achieved was, in the stage of development at which the drama had then\r\narrived, no mean achievement. The dramatic effects are carefully prepared\r\nfor and led up to, reminding us almost at times of the recurrence of a\r\nmusical motive. Thus the song between Paris and Oenone, just before the\r\nshepherd goes off to cross Dame Venus' path, is a fine piece of dramatic\r\nirony as well as a charming lyric; while the effect of the reminiscences\r\nof the song scattered through the later pastoral scenes has been already\r\nnoticed. Another instance is Venus' warning of the pains in store for\r\nfaithless lovers, which fittingly anticipates the words with which Paris\r\nleaves the assembly of the gods. Again, we find a conscious preparation\r\nfor the contention between the goddesses in their previous bickerings, and\r\na conscious juxtaposition of the forsaken Oenone and the love-lorn Colin.\r\nLastly, there are scattered throughout the play not a few graphic touches,\r\nas when Mercury at sight of Oenone exclaims:\r\n\r\n    Dare wage my wings the lass doth love, she looks so bleak and thin!\r\n\r\nSuch then is Peele's mythological play, presented in all the state of a\r\ncourt revel before her majesty by the children of the Chapel Royal, a play\r\nwhich it is more correct to say prepared the ground for than, as is\r\nusually asserted, itself contained the germ of the later pastoral drama.\r\nIn spite of the care bestowed upon its composition, the _Arraignment of\r\nParis_ remains a slight and occasional production; but it nevertheless\r\nclaims its place as one of the most graceful pieces of its kind, and the\r\nascription of the play to Shakespeare, current in the later seventeenth\r\ncentury, is perhaps more of an honour to the elder than of an insult to\r\nthe younger poet. Nor, at a more recent date, was Lamb uncritically\r\nenthusiastic when he said of Peele's play that 'had it been in all parts\r\nequal, the Faithful Shepherdess of Fletcher had been but a second name in\r\nthis sort of Writing.'\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Peele, mention must be made of one other play from his pen,\r\nnamely the _Hunting of Cupid_, known to us unfortunately from a few\r\nfragments only. This is the more tantalizing on account of the freshness\r\nof the passages preserved in _England's Helicon_ and _England's\r\nParnassus_, and in a commonplace-book belonging to Drummond of\r\nHawthornden, and also from the fact that there is good reason to suppose\r\nthat the work was actually printed[212]. So far as can be judged from the\r\nextracts we possess, and from Drummond's jottings, it appears to have been\r\na tissue of mythological conceits, much after the manner of the\r\n_Arraignment_, though possibly somewhat more distinctly pastoral in\r\ntone[213].\r\n\r\nAbout contemporary with the _Arraignment of Paris_ are the earliest plays\r\nof John Lyly, the Euphuist. Most of these are of a mythological character,\r\nwhile three come more particularly under our notice on account of their\r\npastoral tendency, namely, _Gallathea, Love's Metamorphosis_, and the\r\n_Woman in the Moon_[214].\r\n\r\nAlthough Lyly's romance itself lay outside the scope of this inquiry, we\r\nhave already had, in the pastoral work of his imitators, ample\r\nopportunities of becoming acquainted with the peculiarities of the style\r\nhe rendered fashionable. Its laborious affectation is all the more\r\nirritating when we remember that its author, on turning his attention to\r\nthe more or less unseemly brawling of the Martin Mar-prelate pasquilade,\r\nrevealed a command of effective vernacular hardly, if at all, inferior to\r\nthat of his friend Nashe; and its complex artificiality becomes but more\r\napparent when applied to dramatic work. Nevertheless in an age when prose\r\nstyle was in an even more chaotic state than prosody, Euphuism could claim\r\nqualities of no small value and importance, while as an experiment it was\r\nno more absurd, and vastly more popular, than those in classical\r\nversification. Its qualities, when we consider the general state of\r\ncontemporary literature, may well account for the popularity of Lyly's\r\nattempt at novel-writing, but the style was radically unsuited for\r\ndramatic composition, and the result is for the most part hardly to be\r\ntolerated, and can only have met with such court-favour as fell to its\r\nlot, owing to the general fashion for which its success in the romance was\r\nresponsible. It is indeed noteworthy that Lyly is the only writer who ever\r\nventured to apply his literary invention _in toto_ to the uses of the\r\nstage, while even in the romance he lived to see Euphuism as a fashionable\r\nstyle pale before the growing popularity of Arcadianism[215]. The opening\r\nof _Gallathea_ may supply a specimen of the style as it appears in the\r\ndramas; the scene is laid in Lincolnshire, and Tyterus is addressing his\r\ndaughter who gives her name to the piece:\r\n\r\n  In tymes past, where thou seest a heape of small pyble, stoode a stately\r\n  Temple of white Marble, which was dedicated to the God of the Sea, (and\r\n  in right being so neere the Sea): hether came all such as eyther\r\n  ventured by long travell to see Countries, or by great traffique to use\r\n  merchandise, offering Sacrifice by fire, to gette safety by water;\r\n  yeelding thanks for perrils past, and making prayers for good successe\r\n  to come: but Fortune, constant in nothing but inconstancie, did change\r\n  her copie, as the people their custome; for the Land being oppressed by\r\n  Danes, who in steed of sacrifice, committed sacrilidge, in steede of\r\n  religion, rebellion, and made a pray of that in which they should have\r\n  made theyr prayers, tearing downe the Temple even with the earth, being\r\n  almost equall with the skyes, enraged so the God who bindes the windes\r\n  in the hollowes of the earth, that he caused the Seas to breake their\r\n  bounds, sith men had broke their vowes, and to swell as farre above\r\n  theyr reach, as men had swarved beyond theyr reason: then might you see\r\n  shippes sayle where sheepe fedde, ankers cast where ploughes goe,\r\n  fishermen throw theyr nets, where husbandmen sowe their Corne, and\r\n  fishes throw their scales where fowles doe breede theyr quils: then\r\n  might you gather froth where nowe is dewe, rotten weedes for sweete\r\n  roses, and take viewe of monstrous Maremaides, in steed of passing faire\r\n  Maydes.\r\n\r\nThe unsuitability of the style for dramatic purposes will by this be\r\nsomewhat painfully evident, and, as may be imagined, the effect is even\r\nless happy in the case of dialogue. To pursue: the offended deity consents\r\nto withdraw his waters on the condition of a lustral sacrifice of the\r\nfairest virgin of the land, who is to be exposed bound to a tree by the\r\nshore, whence she is carried off by the monster Agar, in whom we may no\r\ndoubt see a personification of the 'eagre' or tidal wave of the Humber. At\r\nthe opening of the play we find the two fairest virgins of the land\r\ndisguised as boys by their respective fathers, in order that they may\r\nescape the penalty of beauty. While they wander the fields and graves,\r\nanother maiden is exposed as the sacrifice, but Neptune, offended by the\r\ndeceit, rejects the proffered victim, and no monster appears to claim its\r\nprey. In the meanwhile, Cupid has eluded the maternal vigilance, and,\r\ndisguised as a nymph, is beginning to display his powers among the\r\nfollowers of Diana. Here is an example of a euphuistic dialogue. Cupid\r\naccosts one of the nymphs:\r\n\r\n    Faire Nimphe, are you strayed from your companie by chaunce, or love\r\n    you to wander solitarily on purpose?\r\n\r\n    _Nymph._ Faire boy, or god, or what ever you bee, I would you knew\r\n    these woods are to me so wel known, that I cannot stray though I would,\r\n    and my minde so free, that to be melancholy I have no cause. There is\r\n    none of Dianaes trayne that any can traine, either out of their waie, or out\r\n    of their wits.\r\n\r\n    _Cupid._ What is that Diana? a goddesse? what her Nimphes?\r\n    virgins? what her pastimes? hunting?\r\n\r\n    _Nym._ A goddesse? who knowes it not? Virgins? who thinkes it not?\r\n    Hunting? who loves it not?\r\n\r\n    _Cup._ I pray thee, sweete wench, amongst all your sweete troope, is\r\n    there not one that followeth the sweetest thing, sweet love?\r\n\r\n    _Nym._ Love, good sir, what meane you by it? or what doe you call it?\r\n\r\n    _Cup._ A heate full of coldnesse, a sweet full of bitternesse, a paine ful\r\n    of pleasantnesse; which maketh thoughts have eyes, and harts eares;\r\n    bred by desire, nursed by delight, weaned by jelousie, kild by dissembling,\r\n    buried by ingratitude; and this is love! fayre Lady, wil you any?\r\n\r\n    _Nym._ If it be nothing else, it is but a foolish thing.\r\n\r\n    _Cup._ Try, and you shall find it a prettie thing.\r\n\r\n    _Nym._ I have neither will nor leysure, but I will followe Diana in the\r\n    Chace, whose virgins are all chast, delighting in the bowe that wounds\r\n    the swift Hart in the Forrest, not fearing the bowe that strikes the softe\r\n    hart in the Chamber.\r\n\r\nThe nymphs are soon in love with the two girls in disguise, and what is\r\nmore, each of these, supposing the other to be what her apparel betokens,\r\nfalls in love with her. After a while, however, Diana becomes suspicious\r\nof the stranger nymph, and her followers make a capture of the boy-god,\r\nwhom they identify by the burn on his shoulder caused by Psyche's lamp,\r\nand set him to untie love-knots. There follows one of those charming songs\r\nfor which Lyly is justly, or unjustly, famous[216].\r\n\r\n    O Yes, O yes, if any Maid,\r\n    Whom lering Cupid has betraid\r\n    To frownes of spite, to eyes of scorne,\r\n    And would in madnes now see torne\r\n    The Boy in Pieces--Let her come\r\n    Hither, and lay on him her doome.\r\n\r\n    O yes, O yes, has any lost\r\n    A Heart, which many a sigh hath cost;\r\n    Is any cozened of a teare,\r\n    Which (as a Pearle) disdaine does weare?--\r\n    Here stands the Thiefe, let her but come\r\n    Hither, and lay on him her doome.\r\n\r\n    Is any one undone by fire,\r\n    And Turn'd to ashes through desire?\r\n    Did ever any Lady weepe,\r\n    Being cheated of her golden sleepe,\r\n    Stolne by sicke thoughts?--The pirats found,\r\n    And in her teares hee shalbe drownd.\r\n    Reade his Inditement, let him heare\r\n    What hees to trust to: Boy, give eare!\r\n\r\nThis is the position of affairs when Venus appears in search of her\r\nwanton, and is shortly followed by the irate Neptune. After some\r\ndisputing, Neptune, to quiet the strife between the goddesses, proposes\r\nthat Diana shall restore the runaway to his mother, in return for which he\r\nwill release the land for ever from its virgin tribute. This happily\r\nagreed upon, the only difficulty remaining is the strange passion between\r\nthe two girls. Venus, however, proves equal to the occasion, and solves\r\nthe situation by transforming one of them into a man. An allusion to the\r\nstory of Iphis and Ianthe told in the ninth book of the _Metamorphoses_\r\nsuggests the source of the incident[217]. Otherwise the play appears to be\r\nin the main original. The exposing of a maiden to the rage of a\r\nsea-monster has been, of course, no novelty since the days of Andromeda,\r\nbut it is unnecessary to seek a more immediate source[218]; while the\r\nintrusion of Cupid in disguise among the nymphs was doubtless suggested by\r\nthe well-known idyl of Moschus, and probably owes to this community of\r\nsource such resemblance as it possesses to the prologue of the _Aminta_.\r\nA comic element is supplied by a sort of young rascals, and a mariner, an\r\nalchemist, and an astrologer, who are totally unconnected with the rest of\r\nthe play. The supposed allusions to real characters need not be taken\r\nseriously. Lyly's rascals are generally recognized as the direct ancestors\r\nof some of Shakespeare's comic characters, and we not seldom find in them\r\nthe germ at least of the later poet's irresistible fun. Take such a speech\r\nas Robin's: 'Why be they deade that be drownd? I had thought they had\r\nbeene with the fish, and so by chance beene caught up with them in a Nette\r\nagaine. It were a shame a little cold water should kill a man of reason,\r\nwhen you shall see a poore Mynow lie in it, that hath no understanding.'\r\nAs regards the euphuistic style, the passages already quoted will suffice,\r\nbut it may be remarked that the marvellous natural history is also put\r\nunder requisition. 'Virgins harts, I perceive,' remarks one of Diana's\r\nnymphs, 'are not unlike Cotton trees, whose fruite is so hard in the\r\nbudde, that it soundeth like steele, and beeing rype, poureth forth\r\nnothing but wooll, and theyr thoughts, like the leaves of Lunary, which\r\nthe further they growe from the Sunne, the sooner they are scorched with\r\nhis beames.' At times one is almost tempted to imagine that Lyly is\r\nlaughing in his sleeve, but as soon as he feels an eye upon him, his face\r\nwould again do credit to a judge. The following is from a scene between\r\nthe two disguised maidens:\r\n\r\n    _Phillida._ It is pitty that Nature framed you not a woman, having\r\n    a face so faire, so lovely a countenaunce, so modest a behaviour.\r\n\r\n    _Gallathea._ There is a Tree in Tylos, whose nuttes have shels like fire,\r\n    and being cracked, the karnell is but water.\r\n\r\n    _Phil._ What a toy is it to tell mee of that tree, beeing nothing to the purpose:\r\n    I say it is pity you are not a woman.\r\n\r\n    _Gall._ I would not wish to be a woman, unless it were because thou art\r\n    a man. (III. ii.)\r\n_Gallathea_ may be plausibly enough assigned to the year 1584[219]. The\r\ndate of the next play we have to deal with, _Love's Metamorphosis_, is\r\nless certain, though Mr. Fleay's conjecture of 1588-9 seems reasonable.\r\nAll that can be said with confidence is that it was later than\r\n_Gallathea_, to which it contains allusions, that it is an inferior work,\r\nand that it has the appearance at least of having been botched up in a\r\nhurry[220]. The story is as follows. Three shepherds, or rather woodmen,\r\nare in love with three of the nymphs of Ceres, but meet with little\r\nsuccess, one of the maidens proving obdurate, another proud, and the third\r\nfickle. The lovers make complaint to Cupid, who consents at their request\r\nto transform the disdainful fair ones into a rock, a rose, and a bird\r\nrespectively. Hereupon Ceres in her turn complains to the God of Love, who\r\npromises that the three shall regain their proper shapes if Ceres will\r\nundertake that they shall thereupon consent to the love of the swains. She\r\ndoes so, and her nymphs are duly restored to their own forms, but at first\r\nflatly refuse to comply with the conditions. After a while they yield:\r\n\r\n    _Nisa._ I am content, so as Ramis, when hee finds me cold in love, or\r\n    hard in beliefe, hee attribute it to his owne folly; in that I retaine some\r\n    nature of the Rocke he chaunged me into....\r\n\r\n    _Celia._ I consent, so as Montanus, when in the midst of his sweete\r\n    delight, shall find some bitter overthwarts, impute it to his folly, in that\r\n    he suffered me to be a Rose, that hath prickles with her pleasantnes, as\r\n    hee is like to have with my love shrewdnes....\r\n\r\n    _Niobe._ I yeelded first in mind though it bee my course last to speake:\r\n    but if Silvestris find me not ever at home, let him curse himselfe that gave\r\n    me wings to flie abroad, whose feathers if his jealousie shall breake, my\r\n    policie shall imp.[221] (V. iv.)\r\n\r\nThis plot, at once elementary and violent, is combined with the fantastic\r\nstory of Erisichthon, 'a churlish husband-man,' who in the nymphs' despite\r\ncuts down the sacred tree of Ceres, into which the chaste Fidelia had\r\nbeen transformed. For this offence the goddess dooms him to the plague of\r\nhunger. The ghastly description of this monster, who may be compared with\r\nBrowne's Limos, was probably suggested by some similar descriptions in the\r\n_Faery Queen_ (I. iv. and III. xii). Erisichthon is put to all manner of\r\nshifts to satisfy the hunger with which he is ever consumed, and is at\r\nlast forced to sell his daughter Protea to a merchant, in order to keep\r\nhimself alive. Protea, it appears, was at one time the paramour of\r\nNeptune, who now in answer to her prayer comes to her aid in such a way\r\nthat, when about to embark on the vessel of her purchaser, she justifies\r\nher name by changing into the likeness of an old fisherman. The deluded\r\nmerchant, after seeking her awhile, is obliged to set sail and depart\r\nwithout his ware. She returns home to find her lover Petulius being\r\ntempted by a 'syren,' who is evidently a mermaid with looking-glass and\r\ncomb and scaly tail, disporting herself by the shore--the scene being\r\nlaid, by the way, on the coast of Arcadia. Protea at once changes her\r\ndisguise to the ghost of Ulysses, and is in time to warn her lover of his\r\ndanger. Finally, at Cupid's intercession her father is relieved of his\r\naffliction by the now appeased goddess. This plot is even more crudely\r\ndistinct from the principal action of the play than is usual with\r\nLyly[222].\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that in the play we have just been considering the\r\nnymphs are no longer treated with the same respect as was the case in\r\n_Gallathea_; we have, in fact, advanced some way towards the satirical\r\nconception and representation of womankind which gives the tone to the\r\n_Woman in the Moon_. It would almost seem as though his experience of the\r\ninconstancy of the royal sunshine had made Lyly a less enthusiastic\r\ndevotee of womanhood in general and of virginity in particular, and that\r\nwith an unadvised frankness which may well account for his disappointments\r\nat court, he failed to conceal his feelings. The play is likewise\r\ndistinguished from the other dramatic works of its author by being\r\ncomposed almost entirely in blank verse. Certain lines of the prologue--\r\n\r\n    Remember all is but a Poets dreame,\r\n    The first he had in Phoebus holy bowre,\r\n    But not the last, unlesse the first displease--\r\n\r\nhave not unnaturally been taken to mean that the piece was the first\r\nventure of the author; but on investigation this will be seen to be\r\nimpossible, since the constant reminiscence of Marlowe in the construction\r\nof the verse points to 1588 or at earliest to 1587 as the date. Mr.\r\nFleay's suggestion of 1589-90 may be accepted as the earliest likely\r\ndate[223]. To my mind it would need external proof of an unusually cogent\r\ndescription to render plausible the theory that the year, say, of the\r\n_Shepherd's Calender_ saw the appearance of such lines as:\r\n\r\n    What lack I now but an imperiall throne[224],\r\n    And Ariadnaes star-lyght Diadem? (II. i.)\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\n    O Stesias, what a heavenly love hast thou!\r\n    A love as chaste as is Apolloes tree,\r\n    As modest as a vestall Virgins eye,\r\n    And yet as bright as Glow wormes in the night,\r\n    With which the morning decks her lovers hayre; (IV. i.)\r\n\r\nor yet again:\r\n\r\n    When will the sun go downe? flye Phoebus flye!\r\n    O, that thy steeds were wingd with my swift thoughts:\r\n    Now shouldst thou fall in Thetis azure armes[225],\r\n    And now would I fall in Pandoraes lap. (IV. i.)\r\n\r\nNor are these isolated passages; from the opening lines of the prologue to\r\nthe final speech of Nature the verse has the appearance of being the work\r\nof a graceful if not very strong hand writing in imitation of Marlowe's\r\nearly style. We must, therefore, it seems to me, take the words of the\r\nprologue as signifying not that the play was the first work of the author,\r\nbut that it was his earliest adventure in verse.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the work is as follows. The shepherds of Utopia come to dame\r\nNature and beg her to make a woman for them. She consents and fashions\r\nPandora, whom she dowers with the virtues of the several Planets. These,\r\nhowever, are offended at not being consulted in the matter, and determine\r\nto use their influence to the bane of the newly created woman. Under the\r\nreign of Saturn she turns sullen; when Jupiter is in the ascendant he\r\nfalls in love with her, but she has grown proud and scorns him; under Mars\r\nshe becomes a vixen; under Sol she in her turn falls in love, and turns\r\nwanton under Venus; she learns deceit of Mercury when he is dominant, and\r\nruns mad under the influence of Luna. At length, since the shepherds will\r\nno longer have anything to do with the lady, Nature determines to place\r\nher in the heavens. Her beauty makes each planet desire her as companion.\r\nNature gives her the choice:\r\n\r\n      Speake, my Pandora; where wilt thou be?\r\n    _Pandora._ Not with old Saturne for he lookes like death;\r\n      Nor yet with Jupiter, lest Juno storme;\r\n      Nor with thee Mars, for Venus is thy love;\r\n      Nor with thee Sol, thou hast two Parramours,\r\n      The sea borne Thetis and the rudy morne;\r\n      Nor with thee Venus, lest I be in love\r\n      With blindfold Cupid or young Joculus;\r\n    Nor with thee Hermes, thou art full of sleightes,\r\n      And when I need thee Jove will send thee foorth.\r\n      Say Cynthia, shall Pandora rule thy starre,\r\n      And wilt thou play Diana in the woods,\r\n      Or Hecate in Plutos regiment?\r\n    _Luna._ I, Pandora.\r\n    _Pand._ Fayre Nature let thy hand mayd dwell with her,\r\n      For know that change is my felicity,\r\n      And ficklenesse Pandoraes proper forme.\r\n      Thou madst me sullen first, and thou Jove, proud;\r\n      Thou bloody minded; he a Puritan:\r\n      Thou Venus madst me love all that I saw,\r\n      And Hermes to deceive all that I love;\r\n      But Cynthia made me idle, mutable,\r\n      Forgetfull, foolish, fickle, franticke, madde;\r\n      These be the humors that content me best,\r\n      And therefore will I stay with Cynthia....\r\n    _Nat._ Now rule, Pandora, in fayre Cynthias steede,\r\n      And make the moone inconstant like thy selfe;\r\n      Raigne thou at womens nuptials, and their birth;\r\n      Let them be mutable in all their loves,\r\n      Fantastical, childish, and foolish, in their desires,\r\n      Demaunding toyes:\r\n      And stark madde when they cannot have their will.\r\n      Now follow me ye wandring lightes of heaven,\r\n      And grieve not, that she is not plast with you;\r\n      Ail you shall glaunce at her in your aspects,\r\n      And in conjunction dwell with her a space. (V. i.)\r\n\r\nAnd so Pandora becomes the 'Woman in the Moon.' The play, in its topical\r\nand satiric purpose, and above all, in its utilization of mythological\r\nmaterial, bears a distinct relationship to the masque. The shepherds are\r\nin their origin philosophical, standing for the race of mankind in\r\ngeneral, rather than pastoral; Utopian, in fact, rather than Arcadian.\r\nThese early mythological plays stand alone, in that the pastoral scenes\r\nthey contain are apparently uninfluenced by the Italian drama. The kind\r\nattained some popularity as a subject of courtly presentation, but it did\r\nnot long preserve its original character. The later examples, with which\r\nwe shall be concerned hereafter, always exhibit some characteristics which\r\nmay be immediately or ultimately traced to the influence of Tasso and\r\nGuarini. This influence we must now turn to consider in some detail, as\r\nevidenced as well in translations and imitations as in the general tone\r\nand machinery of an appreciable portion of the Elizabethan drama.[226]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any inquiry involving the question of foreign influence in literature\r\nit is obviously necessary to treat of the work done in the way of\r\ntranslation, although when the influence is of at all a widespread nature,\r\nas in the present instance, such discussion is apt to usurp a position\r\nunjustified by its intrinsic importance. In most cases, probably, the\r\nenergy devoted to the task of rendering the foreign models directly into\r\nthe language they influenced is rather useful as supplying us with a rough\r\nmeasure of their popularity than itself significant as a step in the\r\noperation of that influence. We may safely assume that, in the case of the\r\nEnglish pastoral drama, the influence exercised directly by the Italian\r\nmasterpieces was beyond comparison greater than that which made itself\r\nindirectly felt through the labours of translators.\r\n\r\nHaving thus anticipated a possible misapprehension it will be worth our\r\nwhile to devote some little attention to the history of the attempts at\r\ntranslation in this line. The first English writer to venture upon the\r\ntask of turning the choice music of Tasso into his native language was the\r\neccentric satellite of the Sidneyan circle, Abraham Fraunce, fellow of St.\r\nJohn's College in Cambridge. It so happened that he was at the time\r\npursuing that elusive phantasm, the application of the laws of classical\r\nversification to English poetry. The resuit was at least unique, in\r\nEnglish, at any rate, namely a drama in hexameter verse. It also occurred\r\nto him that Watson's _Lamentations of Amyntas_, a translation of which he\r\nhad himself published in 1587, might be made to serve as an appendix to\r\nTasso's play. With this object in view he changed the name of the heroine\r\nfrom Silvia to Phillis. This appears to have been the exact extent to\r\nwhich he 'altered S. Tassoes Italian' in order to connect it with 'M.\r\nWatsons Latine Amyntas' and 'to make them both one English.'[227] Certain\r\nother changes were, however, introduced upon other considerations. Various\r\nunessential points were omitted, notably in connexion with Tirsi, whose\r\ntopical character disappears; the name Nerina is altered to Fulvia;\r\nfrequent allusions are introduced to the nymph Pembrokiana, to whom among\r\nother things is ascribed the rescue of the heroine from the bear which\r\ntakes the place of the wolf in Tasso. Lastly, we have the addition of a\r\nwhole scene immediately before the final chorus. Phillis and Amyntas\r\nreappear and carry on a conversation, not unamiably, in a sort of\r\nhexametrical stichomythia. The maiden modestly seeks to restrain the\r\namorous impatience of her lover, and the scene ends with a song between\r\nthe two composed in 'Asclepiades.'[228] Of this literary curiosity\r\nAmyntas' opening stave may be quoted:\r\n\r\n    Sweete face, why be the hev'ns soe to the bountifull,\r\n    Making that radiant bewty of all the starrs\r\n    Bright-burning, to be fayre Phillis her ornament?\r\n    And yet seeme to be soe spytefuly partial,\r\n    As not for to aford Argus his eyes to mee,\r\n    Eyes too feawe to behould Phillis her ornament?\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, not a little strange that the pedant who made the\r\npreposterous experiment of turning the _Aminta_ into English hexameters\r\nshould nevertheless have been capable of clearly perceiving, however\r\nincapable he was of adequately rectifying, the hopelessly undramatic\r\ncharacter of the last act of Tasso's play. As an example of the style of\r\nthe translation we may take the following rendering of the delicate _Chi\r\ncrederia_, with which the original prologue opens:\r\n\r\n    Who would think that a God lay lurking under a gray cloake,\r\n    Silly Shepheards gray cloake, and arm'd with a paltery sheephooke?\r\n    And yet no pety God, no God that gads by the mountaines,\r\n    But the triumphantst God that beares any sway in Olympus:\r\n    Which many times hath made man-murdring Mars to be cursing\r\n    His blood-sucking blade; and prince of watery empire\r\n    Earth-shaking Neptune, his threeforckt mace to be leaving,\r\n    And Jove omnipotent, as a poore and humble obeissant,\r\n    His three-flak't lightnings and thunderbolts to abandon.\r\n\r\nThis is in some respects not wholly inadequate; indeed, if it happened to\r\nbe English it might pass for a respectable translation, for the exotic\r\npedantry of the style itself serves in a way to render the delicate\r\nartificiality of the original, and such an expression as a 'God that gads\r\nby the mountaines' is a pithy enough paraphrase of _dio selvaggio_, if\r\nhardly an accurate translation. The unsatisfactory nature of the verse,\r\nhowever, for dramatic purposes becomes evident in passages of rapid\r\ndialogue; for example, where Daphne tells the careless nymph of Amyntas'\r\nresolve to die.\r\n\r\n    _Phillis._ As to my house full glad for joy I repayred, I met thee\r\n    Daphne, there full sad by the way, and greately amased.\r\n\r\n    _Daphne._ Phillis alas is alive, but an other's gone to be dying[229].\r\n\r\n    _Ph._ And what mean's this, alas? am I now so lightly regarded,\r\n    That my life with, Alas, of Daphne must be remembred?\r\n\r\n    _Da._ Phillis, I love thy life, but I lyke not death of an other.\r\n\r\n    _Ph._ Whose death?\r\n\r\n    _Da._       Death of Amyntas.\r\n\r\n    _Ph._               Alas how dyed Amyntas?\r\n\r\n    _Da._ How? that I cannot tell; nor yet well whether it is soe:\r\n    But noe doubt, I beleeve; for it is most lyke that it is soe.\r\n\r\n    _Ph._ What strange news doe I heare? what causd that death of Amyntas?\r\n\r\n    _Da._ Thy death.\r\n\r\n    _Ph._      And I alive?\r\n\r\n    _Da._           Thy death was lately reported,\r\n    And he beleevs thy death, and therfore seeketh his owne death.\r\n\r\n    _Ph._ Feare of Phillis death prov'd vayne, and feare of Amyntas\r\n    Death will proove vayne too: life eache thing lyvely procureth. (IV. i.)\r\n\r\nEven in such a passage as this, however, those strong racy phrases which\r\nsomehow find their way into the most uninspired of Tudor translations, are\r\nnot wholly wanting. Thus when the careless nymph at last goes off to seek\r\nher desperate lover, Daphne in the original remarks:\r\n\r\n         Oh tardi saggia, e tardi\r\n    Pietosa, quando ciò nulla rileva;\r\n\r\na passage in translating which Fraunce cannot resist the application of a\r\nhomely proverb, and writes:\r\n\r\n    When steedes are stollen, then Phillis looks to the stable.\r\n\r\nIt may, at first sight, appear strange that at a time when the Italian\r\npastoral was exercising its greatest influence over the English drama this\r\ntranslation by Fraunce of Tasso's play should have satisfied the demand\r\nfor more than thirty years. The explanation, of course, is that the\r\nwidespread knowledge of Italian among the reading public in England\r\nrendered translation more or less superfluous[230], while at the same time\r\nit should be remembered that in this country Tasso was far surpassed in\r\npopularity by Guarini. So far as we can tell no further translation of the\r\n_Aminta_ was attempted till 1628, when there appeared an anonymous version\r\nwhich bibliographers have followed one another in ascribing to one John\r\nReynolds, but which was more probably the work of a certain Henry\r\nReynolds[231]. However that may be, the translation is of no\r\ninconsiderable merit, though this is more apparent when read apart from\r\nthe original. It bears evidence of having been written by a man capable of\r\nappreciating the poetry of Tasso, and one who, while unable to strike the\r\nhigher chords of lyric composition, was yet able to render the Italian\r\ninto graceful and unassuming, if seldom wholly musical or adequate, verse.\r\nThus the version hardly does itself justice in quotation, although the\r\ngeneral impression produced is more pleasing and less often irritating\r\nthan is the case with translations which many times reveal far higher\r\nqualities. The following is a characteristic specimen chosen from the\r\nstory of Aminta's early love for Silvia.\r\n\r\n    Being but a Lad, so young as yet scarce able\r\n    To reach the fruit from the low-hanging boughes\r\n    Of new-growne trees; Inward I grew to bee\r\n    With a young mayde, fullest of love and sweetnesse,\r\n    That ere display'd pure gold tresse to the winde;...\r\n    Neere our abodes, and neerer were our hearts;\r\n    Well did our yeares agree, better our thoughts;\r\n    Together wove we netts t' intrapp the fish\r\n    In flouds and sedgy fleetes[232]; together sett\r\n    Pitfalls for birds; together the pye'd Buck\r\n    And flying Doe over the plaines we chac'de;\r\n    And in the quarry', as in the pleasure shar'de:\r\n    But as I made the beasts my pray, I found\r\n    My heart was lost, and made a pray to other. (I. ii.)\r\n\r\nMany a translator, moreover, has failed to instil into his verse the swing\r\nand flow of the following stanzas from the golden age chorus, which,\r\nnevertheless follow the metrical form of the original with reasonable\r\nfidelity[233]:\r\n\r\n    O happy Age of Gould; happy' houres;\r\n    Not for with milke the rivers ranne,\r\n    And hunny dropt from ev'ry tree;\r\n    Nor that the Earth bore fruits, and flowres,\r\n    Without the toyle or care of Man,\r\n    And Serpents were from poyson free;...\r\n      But therefore only happy Dayes,\r\n    Because that vaine and ydle name,\r\n    That couz'ning Idoll of unrest,\r\n    Whom the madd vulgar first did raize,\r\n    And call'd it Honour, whence it came\r\n    To tyrannize or'e ev'ry brest,\r\n      Was not then suffred to molest\r\n    Poore lovers hearts with new debate;\r\n    More happy they, by these his hard\r\n    And cruell lawes, were not debar'd\r\n    Their innate freedome; happy state;\r\n    The goulden lawes of Nature, they\r\n    Found in their brests; and them they did obey. (Ch. I.)\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the _Aminta_ it will be worth while straying beyond the\r\nstrict chronological limits of this inquiry to glance for a moment at the\r\nversion produced by John Dancer in 1660, for the sake of noting the change\r\nwhich had come over literary hack-work of the kind in the course of some\r\nthirty years. Comparing it with Reynolds' translation we are at first\r\nstruck by the change which long drilling of the language to a variety of\r\nuses has accomplished in the work of uninspired poetasters; secondly, by\r\nthe fact that the conventional respectability of production, which has\r\nreplaced the halting crudities of an earlier date, is far more inimical\r\nto any real touch of poetic inspiration. Equally evident is that spirit of\r\ntyranny, happily at no time native to our literature, which seeks to\r\nreduce the works of other ages into accordance with the taste of its own\r\nday. Thus, having 'improved' Tasso's apostrophe to the _bella età dell'\r\noro_ almost beyond recognition, Dancer complacently closes the chorus with\r\nthe following parody:\r\n\r\n    We'l hope, since there's no joy, when once one dies\r\n    We'l hope, that as we have seen with our eies\r\n    The Sun to set, so we may see it rise. (Ch. I.)\r\n\r\nAgain, while all the spontaneity and reverential labour of an age of more\r\navowed adolescence has disappeared, there is yet lacking the justness of\r\nphrase and certainty of grammar and rime, which later supply, however\r\ninadequately, the place of poetic enthusiasm. The defects of the style,\r\nwith its commonplace exaggeration of conceits, the thumbed token-currency\r\nof the certified poetaster, are well seen in such a passage as the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n    Weak love is held by shame, but love grows bold\r\n    As strong, what is it then can it with-hold:\r\n    She as though in her ey's she did contain\r\n    Fountains of tears, did with such plenty rain\r\n    Them on his cheeks, and they such vertue had,\r\n    That it reviv'd again the breathlesse lad;...\r\n    Aminta thought 'twas more then heav'nly charms,\r\n    That thus enclasp'd him in his Silvia's armes;\r\n    He that loves servant is, perhaps may guesse\r\n    Their blisse; but none there is can it expresse[234]. (V. i.)\r\n\r\nAs was to be expected, the attention of translators was early directed to\r\nthe _Pastor fido_. The original was printed in England, together with the\r\n_Aminta_, the year after its first appearance in Italy, that is in 1591,\r\nand bore the imprint of John Wolfe, 'a spese di Giacopo Castelvetri'; the\r\nfirst translation saw the light in 1602. This version was published\r\nanonymously, and in spite of the confident assertions and ingenious\r\nconjectures of certain bibliographers, anonymous it must for the present\r\nremain; all that can with certainty be affirmed is that it claims to be\r\nthe work of a kinsman of Sir Edward Dymocke[235]. Most modern writers who\r\nhave had occasion to mention it have shown a praiseworthy deference to the\r\nauthority of one of the most venerable figures of English criticism by\r\neach in turn repeating that the translation, 'in spite of Daniel's\r\ncommendatory sonnet, is a very bad one.' And indeed, when we have stated\r\nthe very simple facts concerning the authorship as distinct from the very\r\nelaborate conjectures, there remains little to add to Dyce's words. With\r\nthe exception of the omission of the prologue the version keeps pretty\r\nfaithfully to its original, but it does no more than emphasize the tedious\r\nartificiality of the Italian, while whatever charm and perhaps\r\nover-elaborated grace of language Guarini infused into his verse has\r\nentirely evaporated in the process of translation. No less a poet and\r\ncritic than Daniel, regarding the work doubtless with the undiscriminating\r\neye of friendship, asserted that it might even to Guarini himself have\r\nvindicated the poetic laurels of England, and yet from the whole long poem\r\nit is hardly possible to extract any passage which would do credit to the\r\npen of an average schoolboy. We turn in vain to the contest of kisses\r\namong the Megarean maidens, to the game of blind man's buff, to Amarillis'\r\nsecret confession of love, and to her trembling appeal when confronted by\r\na death of shame, for any evidence of poetie feeling. The girl's speech in\r\nthe last-mentioned scene, 'Se la miseria mia fosse mia colpa,' is thus\r\nrendered:\r\n\r\n    If that my fault did cause my wretchednesse,\r\n    Or that my thoughts were wicked, as thou thinkst\r\n    My deed, lesse grievous would my death be then:\r\n    For it were just my blood should wash the spots\r\n    Of my defiled soule, heavens rage appease,\r\n    And humane justice justly satisfie,\r\n    Then could I quiet my afflicted sprights,\r\n    And with a just remorse of well-deserved death,\r\n    My senses mortifie, and come to death:\r\n    And with a quiet blow pass forth perhaps\r\n    Unto a life of more tranquilitie:\r\n    But too too much, Nicander, too much griev'd\r\n    I am, in so young years, Fortune so hie,\r\n    An Innocent, I should be doom'd to die. (IV. v.)\r\n\r\nThe next translation we meet with never got into print. It is preserved in\r\na manuscript at the British Museum[236], and bears the heading: 'Il Pastor\r\nFido, or The Faithfull Sheapheard. An Excellent Pastorall Written In\r\nItalian by Battista Guarinj And translated into English By Jonathan Sidnam\r\nEsq, Anno 1630.' The prologue is again omitted, and the translation is\r\ndistinguished from its contemporaries by an endeavour to reproduce to some\r\nextent the freer metrical structure of the Italian. This was not a\r\nparticularly happy experiment, since it ignored the fact that the\r\ncharacter of a metre may differ considerably in different languages. The\r\nItalian _endecasillabi sciolti_ are far less flexible than our own blank\r\nverse, and it is only when freely interspersed with the shorter\r\n_settinarî_ that they can attempt to rival the range of effect possible to\r\nthe English metre in the hands of a skilful artist. Thus the imitation of\r\nthe irregular measures of Guarini was a confession of the translator's\r\ninability adequately to handle the dramatic verse of his own tongue. As a\r\nspecimen we may take the rendering of Amarillis' speech already quoted\r\nfrom the 'Dymocke' version:\r\n\r\n    If my mischance had come by mine own fault,\r\n    Nicander, or had beene as thou beleevst\r\n    The foule effect of base and wicked thoughts,\r\n    Or, as it now appeares, a deed of Sinn,\r\n    It had beene then lesse greevous to endure\r\n    Death as a punishment for such a fault,\r\n    And just it had beene with my blood to wash\r\n    My impure Soule, to mitigate the wrath\r\n    And angar of the Godds, and satisfie\r\n    The right of humane justice,\r\n    Then could I quiett my afflicted Soule\r\n    And with an inward feeling of my just\r\n    Deserved death, subdue my outward Sence,\r\n    And fawne uppon my end, and happelie\r\n    With a more settled countenance passe from hence\r\n    Into a better world:\r\n    But now, Nicander, ah! tis too much greefe\r\n    In soe yong yeares, in such a happie state,\r\n    To die so suddenlie, and which is more,\r\n    Die innocent. (IV. v.)\r\n\r\nIt was not until the civil war was at its height, namely in 1647, that\r\nEnglish literature was enriched with a translation in any way worthy of\r\nGuarini's masterpiece. It is easy to strain the interpretation of such\r\nfacts, but there is certainly a strong temptation to see in the occasion\r\nand circumstances of the composition of the piece an illustration of a\r\ncritical law already noticed, namely the constant tendency of literature\r\nto negative as well as to reproduce the life of actuality, and furthermore\r\nof the special liability of pastoral to take birth from a desire to escape\r\nfrom the imminence and pressure of surrounding circumstance. Like\r\nReynolds' _Aminta_, Richard Fanshawe's _Pastor fido_ is better appreciated\r\nas a whole than in quotation, though, thanks partly to its own greater\r\nmaturity of poetic attainment, partly to the less ethereal perfection of\r\nthe original, it suffers far less than the earlier work by comparison with\r\nthe Italian. For the same reasons it is by far the most satisfactory of\r\nany of the early translations of the Italian pastoral drama. One\r\nnoticeable feature is the constant reminiscence of Shakespeare, whole\r\nlines from his works being sometimes introduced with no small skill. For\r\ninstance, where Guarini, describing how love wins entrance to a maiden's\r\nheart, writes:\r\n\r\n    E se vergogna il cela,\r\n    O temenza l' affrena,\r\n    La misera tacendo\r\n    Per soverchio desío tutta si strugge; (I. iv.)\r\n\r\nFanshawe renders the last two lines by:\r\n\r\n    Poor soul! Concealment like a worm i' th' bud,\r\n    Lies in her Damask cheek sucking the bloud.\r\n\r\nA few illustrative passages will suffice to give an idea of Fanshawe's\r\nstyle. He stands alone in having succeeded in recrystallizing in his own\r\ntongue some at least of the charm of the kissing match, and is even fairly\r\nsuccessful in the following dangerous conceit:\r\n\r\n              With one voice\r\n    Of peerlesse Amarillis they made choice.\r\n    She sweetly bending her fair eyes.\r\n    Her cheeks in modest blushes dyes,\r\n    To shew through her transparent skin\r\n    That she is no lesse fair within\r\n    Then shee's without; or else her countenance\r\n    Envying the honour done her mouth perchance,\r\n    Puts on her scarlet robes as who\r\n    Should say: 'And am not I fair too?' (II. i.)\r\n\r\nSo again he alone among the translators has infused any semblance of\r\npassion into Amarillis' confession of love:\r\n\r\n    Mirtillo, O Mirtillo! couldst thou see\r\n    That heart which thou condemn'st of cruelty,\r\n    Soul of my soul, thou unto it wouldst show\r\n    That pity which thou begg'st from it I know.\r\n    O ill starr'd Lovers! what avails it me\r\n    To have thy love? T' have mine, what boots it thee?\r\n                                                     (III. iv.)\r\n\r\nIn a lighter vein the following variation on the theme of fading beauty by\r\nCorisca also does justice to its original:\r\n\r\n    Let us use it whilst wee may;\r\n    Snatch those joyes that haste away.\r\n    Earth her winter-coat may cast,\r\n    And renew her beauty past;\r\n    But, our winter come, in vain\r\n    We sollicite spring again:\r\n    And when our furrows snow shall cover,\r\n    Love may return, but never Lover. (III. v.)\r\n\r\nWhen it is borne in mind that not only is the rendering graceful in\r\nitself, but that as a rule it represents its original if not literally at\r\nany rate adequately, it will be realized that Fanshawe's qualifications as\r\na translator are not small. His version, which is considerably the best in\r\nthe language, is happily easily accessible owing to its early popularity.\r\nIt first appeared in 1647 in the form of a handsomely printed quarto with\r\nportrait and frontispiece engraved after the Ciotti edition of 1602, the\r\nremaining copies being re-issued with additional matter the following\r\nyear; it went through two editions between the restoration and the end of\r\nthe century, and was again reprinted together with the original, and with\r\nalterations in 1736[237]. In the meantime, however, the translation had\r\nbeen adapted to the stage by Elkanah Settle. In a dedication to Lady\r\nElizabeth Delaval, the adapter ingenuously disclaims all knowledge of\r\nItalian, and when he speaks of 'the Translated _Pastor Fido_' every reader\r\nwould no doubt be expected to know that he was referring to Fanshawe's\r\nwork. He left his readers, however, to discover for themselves that,\r\nwhile he considerably altered, and of course condensed, the original, for\r\nwhatever poetic merit his scenes possess he is entirely indebted to his\r\npredecessor. The adaptation was licensed by L'Estrange in 1676, and\r\nprinted the following year, while reprints dated 1689 and 1694 seem to\r\nindicate that it achieved some success at the Duke's Theatre. It was\r\npresumably of this version that Pepys notices a performance on February\r\n25, 1668.[238]\r\n\r\nBesides these English translations there is also extant one in Latin, a\r\nmanuscript of which is preserved in the University Library at\r\nCambridge.[239] The name of the translater does not appear, but the\r\nheading runs: 'Il pastor fido, di signor Guarini ... recitata in Collegio\r\nRegali Cantabrigiae.' The title is so scrawled over that it would be\r\nimpossible to say for certain whether the note of performance referred to\r\nthe present play, were it not for an allusion casually dropped by the\r\nanonymous recorder of a royal visit to Oxford, which not only\r\nsubstantiates the inference to be drawn from the manuscript, but also\r\nsupplies us with a downward limit of August, 1605.[240] In this\r\ntranslation a dialogue between the characters 'Prologus' and 'Argumentum'\r\ntakes the place of Guarini's long topical prologue, and a short\r\nconventional 'Epilogus' is added at the end.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was not till 1655 that _the Filli di Sciro_ of Bonarelli, which has\r\nusually been thought to hold the third place among Italian pastorals,\r\nappeared in English dress. The translation published in that year is\r\nascribed on the title-page to 'J. S. Gent.,' an ascription which has given\r\nrise to a good deal of conjecture. And yet a very little investigation\r\nmight have settled the matter. Prefixed to the translation are some\r\ncommendatory verses signed 'I. H.', in a marginal note to which we read:\r\n'This Comedy was Translated long ago by M. _I. S._ and layd by, as also\r\nwas _Pastor Fido_, which was since Translated and set forth by Mr. Rich.\r\nFanshaw.' Another note,[241] to some verses to the reader, tells us that\r\nboth translations were made 'neer twenty years agone,' and, as we should\r\nexpect, the _Pastor fido_ first; and further, that the latter remained in\r\nmanuscript owing to the appearance of Fanshawe's version, which is spoken\r\nof in terms of warm admiration. Now the only manuscript translation of\r\nGuarini's play extant in English is that of Jonathan Sidnam, whose name\r\ngives us the very initials which appear upon the title-page of the printed\r\nplay.[242] Since the preliminary verses may have been written any time\r\nbetween 1647 and 1655, the vague allusion to the date of composition will\r\nquite well fit 1630, the year given in the manuscript. When, furthermore,\r\nwe find J. S.'s work characterized by precisely the same use of short\r\nlines as we noted above in the case of Sidnam's, the identification\r\nbecomes a practical certainty. The version, though, as the author was\r\nhimself aware, it will not stand comparison with Fanshawe's work, is not\r\nwithout merit, and is perhaps as good as the rather tedious original\r\ndeserves. As a specimen we may take a passage in which the author\r\ndeliberately followed Tasso, Celia's narration of her adventure with the\r\ncentaur:\r\n\r\n    There, to a sturdy Oak, he bound me fast\r\n    And re-enforct his base inhumane bonds\r\n    With the then danglinst Tresses of my hair;\r\n    Ingrateful hair, ill-nurtur'd wicked Locks!\r\n    The cruel wretch then took up from the foot\r\n    Both my loose tender garments, and at once\r\n    Rent them from end to end: Imagine then\r\n    Whether my crimson red, through shame was chang'd\r\n    Into a pale wan tincture, yea or no.\r\n    I that was looking toward Heaven then,\r\n    And with my cries imploring ayd from thence,\r\n    Upon a suddain to the Earth let fall\r\n    My shamefac'd eyes, and shut them close, as if\r\n    Under mine eye-lids, I could cover all\r\n    My naked Members. (I. iii.)\r\n\r\nOf the various unfounded conjectures as to the author of this version,\r\namong which Shirley's name has of course not failed to appear, certainly\r\nthe most ingenious is that which has seen in it the work of Sir Edward\r\nSherburne. The suggestion appears to have been originally made by Coxeter,\r\non what grounds I do not know. 'There is no doubt of the authorship of\r\nthis play,' writes Professer Gollancz in his notes to Lamb's _Specimens_,\r\n'\"J. S.\" is certainly an error for \"E. S.\" I have found in a MS. in the\r\nBritish Museum Sir E. Sherburne's preface to this play.' Professer\r\nGollancz deserves credit for having unearthed the interesting document\r\nreferred to,[243] but an examination of it at once destroys his theory. It\r\nis a preface 'To the Reader' intended for a translation of the _Filli_,\r\nand another copy also is extant,[244] both being found among the papers of\r\nSir Edward Sherburne, though in neither does his name actually occur. In\r\nthe course of the preface the writer quotes 'the Censure of my sometime\r\nhighly valued, and most Ingenious friend S'r. John Denham, to whom (some\r\nyears before the happy Restauration of King Charles the 2^{d} being then\r\nat Paris) I communicated Some Part of this my Translation. Who was not\r\nonly pleasd to encourage my undertaking, but gave me likewise this\r\nCharacter of the Original. \"I will not say It is a Better Poem then Pastor\r\nFido, but to speak my Mind freely, I think it a Better Drama.\"' From this\r\nit is clear that the preface was penned after 1660, and we may furthermore\r\ninfer that the version was as yet unfinished when the writer was in Paris,\r\napparently at some time during the Commonwealth. It is therefore\r\nimpossible that the preface should be intended for a translation which was\r\nprinted in 1655, and which was then distinctly stated to have been\r\ncomposed not later than 1635. Furthermore, I question whether either the\r\npreface or the version mentioned therein were by Sherburne at all. There\r\nis a translation extant in a British Museum manuscript[245] purporting to\r\nbe the work of Sir George Talbot, who is said to have been a friend of Sir\r\nEdward's, into whose hands some of his papers may have come. The\r\ntranslation is headed: 'Fillis of Scirus, a Pastorall Written in Italian,\r\nby Count Guidubaldo de' Bonarelli, and Translated into English by S'r. G:\r\nTalbot,' and there follows 'The Epistle Dedicatory To his sacred Ma'ty.\r\nCharles 2'd. &c. prophetically written at Paris, an: 57.' The opening is\r\nnot wanting in grace:\r\n\r\n    The dawning light breaks forth; I heare, aloofe,\r\n    The whistling ayre, the Saints bell of the Heav'n,\r\n    Wherewith each morne it call's the drowsy Birds\r\n    To offer up theyre Hymnes to th' new-borne day.\r\n      But who ere saw, from night's dark bosome, spring\r\n    A morne soe fayre and beautifull? Observe\r\n    With what imperceptible hand, it steales\r\n    The starres from Heav'n, and deck's the earth with flow'rs:\r\n    Haile, lovely fields, your flow'rs in this array\r\n    Fournish a kind of star-light to the day.\r\n\r\nOr take again Celia's encounter with the centaur. And in this connexion it\r\nis worth while mentioning that, when revising his translation and\r\nintroducing a number of verbal changes, in most cases distinctly for the\r\nbetter, Sir George appears to have been struck by the absurdity of this\r\nmachinery, and throughout replaced the centaur by a 'wild man.' After\r\ntelling how she was seized and carried to 'the middle of a desart wood,'\r\nCelia proceeds:\r\n\r\n    There, to a sturdy oake, he bound me fast,\r\n    Doubling my bonds with knots of mine own hayre;\r\n    Ungratefull hayre, thou ill returnst my care.\r\n    The Tyrant then my mantle took in hand\r\n    And with one rash tore it from head to foote.\r\n    Consider whether shame my trembling pale\r\n    Did now convert into Vermillion: up\r\n    I cast my eyes to Heav'n, and with lowd cryes\r\n    Implor'd it's ayd; then lookt downe tow'rd the earth,\r\n    And phancy'd my dejected eyebrows hung\r\n    Like a chast mantle ore my naked limbs. (I. iii.)\r\n\r\nA comparison of this and the preceding renderings with the original will\r\nshow that while Talbot's is by far the more fiowing and imaginative,\r\nSidnam's is on the whole rather more literal, except where he appears to\r\nhave misunderstood the original. No other English translation, I believe,\r\nexists.\r\n\r\nLastly, as in the case of the _Pastor fido_, record has to be made of a\r\nLatin version acted at Cambridge. It was the work of a Dr. Brooke of\r\nTrinity[246], and purports to have been performed, no doubt at that\r\nCollege, before Prince Charles and the Count Palatine, on March 30,\r\n1612[247]. The title is 'Scyros, Fabula Pastoralis,' which has hitherto\r\nprevented its being identified as a translation of Bonarelli's play, and\r\nit is preserved in manuscripts at the University Library[248], Trinity and\r\nEmmanuel. At the beginning is a note to the effect that in the place of\r\nthe prologue--Marino's _Notte_--was to be presented a triumph over the\r\ndeath of the centaur. The cast is given, and includes three\r\nundergraduates, five bachelors, and five masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter translation the next process in logical sequence is direct\r\nimitation. Although it is true that the influence of Tasso and Guarini may\r\nbe traced either directly or indirectly in the great majority of the\r\nEnglish pastorals composed during the first half of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, there are nevertheless two plays only in which that influence can\r\nbe regarded as completely paramount, and to which the term 'imitation' can\r\nbe with full justification applied. These are the two pastorals by Samuel\r\nDaniel, historian and court-laureate, namely the _Queen's Arcadia_, 'A\r\nPastorall Trage-comedie presented to her Majestie and her Ladies, by the\r\nUniversitie of Oxford in Christs Church, in August last. 1605[249],' and\r\n_Hymen's Triumph_, which formed part of the Queen's 'magnificent\r\nintertainement of the Kings most excellent Majestie' on the occasion of\r\nthe marriage in 1614 of Robert Ker, Earl of Roxburgh, and Mistress Jean\r\nDrummond, sister of the Earl of Perth[250].\r\n\r\nThe earlier of these pieces displays alike the greater dependence on\r\nItalian models and the less intrinsic merit, whether from a poetic or\r\ndramatic point of view. It is, indeed, in its apparent carelessness of the\r\nmost elementary necessities of dramatic construction, distinctly\r\nretrograde as compared with these models themselves. In the first scene we\r\nare introduced to two old Arcadians who hold long discourse concerning the\r\ndegeneracy of the age. The simple manners of earlier times are forsaken,\r\nconstant quarrels occur, faith is no longer untarnished nor modesty\r\nsecure. In the hope of probing to the root of the evil the two determine\r\nto hide close at hand and so overhear the conversations of the younger\r\nswains and shepherdesses. The fact is that Arcadia has recently been\r\ninvaded by a gang of rascally adventurers from Corinth and elsewhere:\r\nTechne, 'a subtle wench,' who under pretence of introducing the latest\r\nfashions of the towns corrupts the nymphs; Colax, whose courtier-airs find\r\nan easy prey in the hearts of the country-wenches; Alcon, a quacksalver,\r\nwho introduces tobacco to ruin the constitutions of the shepherds; Lincus,\r\n'a petty-fogger,' who breeds litigation among the simple folk; and lastly\r\nPistophanax, who seeks to undermine the worship of Pan. Colax has, it\r\nappears, already abused the love of Daphne, and won that of Dorinda from\r\nher swain Mirtillus; Techne has sown jealousy between the lovers Palaemon\r\nand Silvia; while Lincus has set Montanus and Acrysius by the ears over\r\nthe possession of a bit of land. Ail the plotting is overheard by the two\r\nconcealed shepherds, who when the crisis is reached come forward, call\r\ntogether the Arcadians, expose the machinations of the evil-doers, and\r\nprocure their banishment from the country. Such an automatic solution is\r\nobviously incompatible with the smallest dramatic interest in the plot; it\r\nis not a _dénoûment_ at all, properly speaking, but a severing of the\r\nskein after Alexander's manner, and it is impossible to feel any emotion\r\nat the tragic complications when all the while the sword lies ready for\r\nthe operation.\r\n\r\nThe main amorous action centres round Cloris, beloved of Amyntas and\r\nCarinus, the latter of whom is in his turn loved by Amarillis. Carinus'\r\nhopes are founded on the fact that, in imitation of Tasso's Aminta, he has\r\nrescued Cloris from the hands of a satyr, while Amyntas bases his upon\r\ncertain signs of favour shown him. Colax, however, also falls in love with\r\nthe nymph, and induces Techne to give her tryst in a cave, where he may\r\nthen have an opportunity of finding her alone. Techne, hereupon, in the\r\nhope of winning Amyntas' affection for herself if she can make him think\r\nCloris unworthy, directs him to the spot where she has promised to meet\r\nthe unsuspecting maiden. This is obviously borrowed from the _Pastor\r\nfido_; indeed, Techne is none other than Corisca under a new name, and it\r\nwas no doubt she who suggested to Daniel the introduction of the other\r\nagents of civilization. Amyntas, on seeing Cloris emerge from the cave in\r\ncompany with Colax, at once concludes her guilt, and in spite of all\r\nTechne's efforts to restrain him rushes off with the intention of putting\r\nan end to his life. Techne, perceiving the ill-success of her plot, tells\r\nCloris of Amyntas' resolve. We here return to the imitation of Tasso:\r\nCloris, like that poet's Silvia, begins by pretending incredulity and\r\nindifference, but being at length convinced agrees to accompany Techne in\r\nsearch of the desperate swain. Daniel has produced what is little better\r\nthan a parody of the scene in his model. Not content with placing in the\r\ngirl's mouth the preposterous excuse:\r\n\r\n    If it be done my help will come too late,\r\n    And I may stay, and save that labour here, (IV. iv.[251])\r\n\r\nhe has spun out the dialogue, already over-long in the original, to an\r\naltogether inordinate and ludicrous extent. When the pair at last come\r\nupon the unhappy lover they find him lying insensible, a horn of poison by\r\nhim. The necessary sequel is reported by Mirtillus:\r\n\r\n    For we perceiv'd how Love and Modestie\r\n    With sev'rall Ensignes, strove within her cheekes\r\n    Which should be Lord that day, and charged hard\r\n    Upon each other, with their fresh supplies\r\n    Of different colours, that still came, and went,\r\n    And much disturb'd her, but at length dissolv'd\r\n    Into affection, downe she casts her selfe\r\n    Upon his senselesse body, where she saw\r\n    The mercy she had brought was come too late:\r\n    And to him calls: 'O deare Amyntas, speake,\r\n    Look on me, sweete Amyntas, it is I\r\n    That calles thee, I it is, that holds thee here,\r\n    Within those armes thou haste esteem'd so deare.' (V. ii.)\r\n\r\nAmyntas' subsequent recovery is reported in the same strain. The reader\r\nwill remember the lines in which Tasso described a similar scene. And yet,\r\nin spite of the identity of the situations and even of the close\r\nsimilarity of the language, the tone and atmosphere of the two passages\r\nare essentially different; for if Daniel's treatment of the scene, which\r\nis typical of a good deal of his work, has the power to call a tear to the\r\neye of sensibility, his sentiment, divested as it is of the Italian's\r\nsubtle sensuousness, appears perfectly innocuous and at times not a little\r\nridiculous.\r\n\r\nCloris and Amyntas are now safe enough, and Carinus has the despised but\r\nfaithful Amarillis to console him. The other pairs of lovers need not\r\ndetain us further than to note that their adventures are equally borrowed\r\nfrom Tasso and Guarini. Silvia relates how, wounded by her 'cruelty,'\r\nPalaemon sought to imitate Aminta by throwing himself from a cliff, but\r\nwas prevented by her timely relenting. Amarillis fondles Carinus's dog,\r\nand is roughly upbraided by its master in the same manner as her prototype\r\nDorinda in the _Pastor fido_.\r\n\r\nAmid much that is commonplace in the verse occur not a few graceful\r\npassages, while Daniel is at times rather happy in the introduction of\r\ncertain sententious utterances in keeping with the conventionality of the\r\npastoral form. Thus a caustic swain remarks of a girl's gift:\r\n\r\n    Poore withred favours, they might teach thee know,\r\n    That shee esteemes thee, and thy love as light\r\n    As those dead flowers, shee wore but for a show,\r\n    The day before, and cast away at night;\r\n\r\nand to a lover:\r\n\r\n    When such as you, poore, credulous, devout,\r\n    And humble soules, make all things miracles\r\n    Your faith conceives, and vainely doe convert\r\n    All shadowes to the figure of your hopes. (I. ii.)\r\n\r\nColax is a subtle connoisseur in love:\r\n\r\n    Some thing there is peculiar and alone\r\n    To every beauty that doth give an edge\r\n    To our desires, and more we still conceive\r\n    In that we have not, then in that we have.\r\n    And I have heard abroad where best experience\r\n    And wit is learnd, that all the fairest choyce\r\n    Of woemen in the world serve but to make\r\n    One perfect beauty, whereof each brings part. (I. iii.)\r\n\r\nThe historical importance of the _Queen's Arcadia_, as the first play to\r\nexhibit on the English stage the direct and unequivocal influence of the\r\nItalian pastoral drama, is evident to the critic in retrospect, and it is\r\nnot impossible that it may have lent some extraneous interest to the\r\nperformance even in the eyes of contemporaries; but the zest of the play\r\nfor a court audience in the early years of the reign of James I was very\r\npossibly the satirical element. The shadowy fiction of Arcadia and its age\r\nof gold quickly vanished when the actual or fancied evils of the day were\r\nexposed to the lash. The abuse of the practice of taking tobacco flattered\r\nthe prejudices of the king; the quack and the dishonest lawyer were stock\r\nbutts of contemporary satire; Colax and Techne, the he and she\r\nconey-catchers, have maintained their fascination for all ages.\r\nPistophanax, the disseminator of false doctrine, who had actually presumed\r\nto reason with the priests concerning the mysteries of Pan, was perhaps\r\nthe favourite object of contemporary invective. The term 'atheist' covered\r\na multitude of sins. This character appears in the final scene only, and\r\neven there he is a mute but for one speech. He is indeed treated in a\r\nsomewhat different manner from the other subjects of satire in the play.\r\nThus the discovery that he is wearing a mask to hide the natural ugliness\r\nof his features passes altogether the bounds of dramatic satire, and\r\ncarries us back to the allegorical manner of the middle ages. Apart from\r\nthese figures, who bear upon them the form and pressure of the time, and\r\nwho are, it must be remembered, the main-spring of the action, there is\r\nlittle of note to fix the attention in this first fruit of the Arcadian\r\nspirit in the English drama.\r\n\r\nIn every way superior to its predecessor is the second venture in the kind\r\nmade by Daniel after an interval of nearly a decade. Instead of being a\r\npatchwork of motives and situations borrowed from the Italian, and pieced\r\ntogether with more or less ingenuity, _Hymen's Triumph_ is as a whole an\r\noriginal composition. The play is preceded by a prologue in which Daniel\r\ndeparts from his models in employing the dialogue form, the speakers being\r\nHymen, Avarice, Envy, and Jealousy[252]. In the opening scene we find\r\nThirsis lamenting the loss of his love Silvia, who is supposed to have\r\nbeen devoured by wild beasts while wandering alone upon the shore--we are\r\nonce again on the sea-board of Arcadia--her rent veil and a lock of her\r\nhair being all that remains to her disconsolate lover. Their vows had been\r\nin secret owing to the match proposed by Silvia's father between her and\r\nAlexis, the son of a wealthy neighbour[253]. In reality she has been\r\nseized by pirates[254] and carried off to Alexandria, where she has lived\r\nas a slave in boy's attire for some two years. Recently an opportunity for\r\nescape having presented itself, she has returned, still disguised, to her\r\nnative country, where she has entered the service of the shepherdess\r\nCloris, waiting till the approaching marriage of Alexis with another nymph\r\nshall have made impossible the renewal of her father's former schemes.\r\nComplications now arise, for it appears that Cloris has fallen in love\r\nwith Thirsis, but fears ill success in her suit, supposing him in his turn\r\nto be pining for the love of Amarillis. She employs the supposed boy to\r\nmove her suit to Thirsis, and Silvia goes on her errand to court her lover\r\nfor her mistress, fearing to find him already faithless to his love for\r\nher[255]. On her mission she is waylaid by the nymph Phillis, who has\r\nfallen in love with her in her male attire, careless of the love borne her\r\nby the honest but rude forester Montanus. The varying fortune of Silvia's\r\nsuit on behalf of Cloris, Thirsis' faith to the memory of Silvia,\r\nMontanus' jealousy, and Phillis' shame when she finds her proffered love\r\nrejected by the boy for whom she has sacrificed her modesty, are presented\r\nin a series of scenes and discourses which do not materially advance the\r\nbusiness in hand. Towards the end of the fourth act, however, we approach\r\nthe climax, and matters begin to move. Alexis' marriage being now\r\nimminent, Silvia thinks she can venture at least to give her lover some\r\nspark of hope by narrating her story under fictitious names. This she\r\ndoes, making use of the transparent anagrams Isulia and Sirthis[256]. As\r\nSilvia ends her tale Montanus rushes in, determined to be revenged for the\r\nfavour shown by his mistress to the supposed youth. He stabs Silvia, and\r\ncarries off the garland she is wearing, believing it to be one woven by\r\nthe hand of Phillis. This naturally leads to the discovery of Silvia's sex\r\nand identity, and supposing her dead, Thirsis falls in a swoon at her\r\nside. The last act is, as usual, little more than an epilogue, in which we\r\nare entertained with a long account of the recovery of the faithful\r\nlovers, thanks to the care of the wise Lamia, an elaborate passage again\r\nmodelled on Tasso, but again falling far short of the poetical beauty of\r\nthe original.\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, and partly through being unencumbered with the satyric\r\nmachinery of the _Queen's Arcadia, Hymen's Triumph_ is a distinctly\r\nlighter and more pleasing composition. At least so it appears by\r\ncomparison, for Daniel everywhere takes himself and his subject with a\r\ndistressing seriousness wholly unsuited to the style; we look in vain for\r\na gleam of humour such as that which in the final chorus of the _Aminta_\r\ncasts a reflex light over the whole play[257]. Again an advance may be\r\nobserved, not only in the conduct of the plot, which moves artistically on\r\nan altogether different level, and even succeeds in arousing some dramatic\r\ninterest, but likewise in the verse, which has a freer movement, and is on\r\nthe whole less marred by the over-emphatic repetition of words and phrases\r\nin consecutive lines, a particularly irritating trick of the author's\r\npastoral style, or by the monotonous cadence and painful padding of the\r\nblank verse. Daniel was emphatically one of those poets, neither few nor\r\ninconsiderable, the natural nervelessness of whose poetic diction\r\nimperatively demands the bracing restraint of rime. It is noteworthy that\r\nthis applies to his verse alone; such a work as the famous _Defence of\r\nRime_ serves to place him once for all among the greatest masters of 'the\r\nother harmony of prose.'\r\n\r\n_Hymen's Triumph_ contains many more passages of notable merit than its\r\npredecessor. There is, indeed, one passage in the _Queen's Arcadia_ which\r\nwill bear comparison with anything Daniel ever wrote, but it stands in\r\nsomewhat striking contrast with its surroundings. This is the opening of\r\nthe speech in which Melibaeus addresses the assembled Arcadians, and well\r\ndeserves quotation.\r\n\r\n    You gentle Shepheards and Inhabitors\r\n    Of these remote and solitary parts\r\n    Of Mountaynous Arcadia, shut up here\r\n    Within these Rockes, these unfrequented Clifts,\r\n    The walles and bulwarkes of our libertie,\r\n    From out the noyse of tumult, and the throng\r\n    Of sweating toyle, ratling concurrencie,\r\n    And have continued still the same and one\r\n    In all successions from antiquitie;\r\n    Whil'st all the states on earth besides have made\r\n    A thousand revolutions, and have rowl'd\r\n    From change to change, and never yet found rest,\r\n    Nor ever bettered their estates by change;\r\n    You I invoke this day in generall,\r\n    To doe a worke that now concernes us all,\r\n    Lest that we leave not to posteritie,\r\n    Th' Arcadia that we found continued thus\r\n    By our fore-fathers care who left it us. (V. iii.)\r\n\r\nSuch passages are more frequent in _Hymen's Triumph_. Take the description\r\nof the early love of Thirsis and Silvia, instinct with a delicacy and\r\nfreshness that even Tasso might have envied[258]:\r\n\r\n    Then would we kisse, then sigh, then looke, and thus\r\n    In that first garden of our simplenesse\r\n    We spent our child-hood; but when yeeres began\r\n    To reape the fruite of knowledge, ah, how then\r\n    Would she with graver looks, with sweet stern brow,\r\n    Check my presumption and my forwardnes;\r\n    Yet still would give me flowers, stil would me shew\r\n    What she would have me, yet not have me, know. (I. i.)\r\n\r\nThirsis, who is the typical 'constant lover' of pastoral convention, and\r\ndoes\r\n\r\n    Hold it to be a most heroicke thing\r\n    To act one man, and do that part exact,\r\n\r\nthus addresses his friend Palaemon in defence of love:\r\n\r\n    Ah, know that when you mention love, you name\r\n    A sacred mistery, a Deity,\r\n    Not understood of creatures built of mudde,\r\n    But of the purest and refined clay\r\n    Whereto th' eternall fires their spirits convey.\r\n    And for a woman, which you prize so low,\r\n    Like men that doe forget whence they are men,\r\n    Know her to be th' especiall creature, made\r\n    By the Creator as the complement\r\n    Of this great Architect[259] the world, to hold\r\n    The same together, which would otherwise\r\n    Fall all asunder; and is natures chiefe\r\n    Vicegerent upon earth, supplies her state.\r\n    And doe you hold it weakenesse then to love,\r\n    And love so excellent a miracle\r\n    As is a worthy woman? (III. iv.)\r\n\r\nThe sententious passages, the occurrence of which we previously noted in\r\nthe _Queen's Arcadia_, likewise appear. Thus of dreams:\r\n\r\n    Alas, Medorus, dreames are vapours, which,\r\n    Ingendred with day thoughts, fall in the night,\r\n    And vanish with the morning;[260] (III. ii.)\r\n\r\nand of thoughts:\r\n\r\n    They are the smallest peeces of the minde\r\n    That passe this narrow organ of the voyce;\r\n    The great remaine behinde in that vast orbe\r\n    Of th' apprehension, and are never borne. (III. iv.)\r\n\r\nAt times these utterances even possess a dramatic value, as where,\r\nbending over the seemingly lifeless form of his beloved Silvia, Thirsis\r\nexclaims:\r\n\r\n    And sure the gods but onely sent thee thus\r\n    To fetch me, and to take me hence with thee. (IV. v.)\r\n\r\nThe two plays we have been considering are after all very much what we\r\nshould expect from their author. A poet of considerable taste, of great\r\nsweetness and some real feeling, but deficient in passion, in power of\r\nconception and strength of execution, writing for the court in the\r\nrecognized rôle of court-laureate, and unexposed to the bracing influence\r\nof a really critical audience--such is Samuel Daniel as seen in his\r\nexperiments in the pastoral drama. We learn from his commendatory sonnet\r\non the 'Dymocke' _Pastor fido_ that he had known Guarini personally in\r\nItaly, an accident which supplies an interesting link between the dramas\r\nof the two countries, and might suggest a specific incentive to the\r\ncomposition of his pastorals, were any such needed. So far, however, from\r\nthat being the case, the only wonder is that the adventure was not made at\r\nan earlier date, a problem the most promising explanation of which may\r\nperhaps be sought in the rather conservative taste of the officiai court\r\ncircle, which tended to lag behind in the general advance during the\r\nclosing years of Elizabeth's reign. With the accession of James new life\r\nas well as a new spirit entered the court, and is quickly found reflected\r\nin the literary fashions in vogue. It was in 1605 that Jonson wrote in\r\n_Volpone_:\r\n\r\n    Here's Pastor Fido ...\r\n              ... All our English writers,\r\n    I meane such, as are happy in th' Italian,\r\n    Will deigne to steale out of this author, mainely;\r\n    Almost as much, as from Montagnie:\r\n    He has so moderne, and facile a veine,\r\n    Fitting the time, and catching the court-eare. (1616, III. iv.)\r\n\r\nOn the whole, perhaps, Daniel's merits as a pastoral writer have been\r\nexaggerated. His dependence on Italian models, particularly in his earlier\r\nplay, is close, both as regards incidents and style; while he usually\r\nlacks their felicity. His claims as an original dramatist will not stand\r\nexamination in view of the concealed shepherds in the _Queen's Arcadia,_\r\nof his careful avoidance of scenes of strong dramatic emotion--a point in\r\nwhich he of course followed his models, while lacking their mastery of\r\nnarrative as compensation--and of his failure to do justice to such scenes\r\nwhen forced upon him.[261] If the atmosphere of certain scenes is purer\r\nthan is the case with his models, it is in large measure due to his\r\nfailure to master the style; if his conception of virtue is more\r\nwholesome, his picture of it is at times marred by exaggeration, while his\r\nsentiment for innocence is of a watery kind, and occasionally a little\r\ntawdry. His pathos, as is the case with all weak writers, constantly\r\ntrembles on the verge of bathos, while his lack of humour betrays him into\r\npenning passages of elaborate fatuity. His style is formal and often\r\nstilted, his verse often monotonous and at times heavy.[262] On the other\r\nhand Daniel possesses qualities of no vulgar kind, though some, it is\r\ntrue, may be said to be rather the _qualités de ses défauts_. The verse is\r\nat least smooth; it is courtly and scholarly, and sometimes graceful; the\r\nlanguage is pure and refined, and habitually simple. The sentiment, if at\r\ntimes finicking, is always that of a gentleman and a courtier. Moreover,\r\nin reckoning his qualifications as a dramatist, we must not forget to\r\ncredit him with the plot of _Hymen's Triumph_, which is on the whole\r\noriginal, and is happily conceived, firmly constructed, and executed with\r\nconsiderable ability.\r\n\r\nWith Daniel begins and ends in English literature the dominant influence\r\nof the Italian pastoral drama. No doubt the imitation of Tasso and Guarini\r\nis an important element in the subsequent history of pastoralism in this\r\ncountry, and to trace and define that influence will be not the least\r\nimportant task of the ensuing chapters. No doubt it supplied the incentive\r\nthat induced a man like Fletcher to bid for a hopeless success in such a\r\nplay as the _Faithful Shepherdess_, and placed a heavy debt to the account\r\nof Thomas Randolph when he composed his _Amyntas_. But in these cases, as\r\nin others, wherever the author availed himself of the tradition imported\r\nfrom the Ferrarese court, he approached it as it were from without,\r\nseeking to rival, to acclimatize, rather than to reproduce. Nowhere else\r\ndo we find the tone and atmosphere, the structure, situations, and\r\ncharacters imitated with that fidelity, or attempt at fidelity, which\r\nmakes Daniel's plays almost indistinguishable, except for language, from\r\nmuch of the work of the later Italians.[263] To minimize with many critics\r\nDaniel's dependence on his models, or to emphasize with some that of\r\nFletcher, is, it seems to me, wholly to misapprehend the positions they\r\noccupy in the history of literature, and to obscure the actual development\r\nof the pastoral ideal in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V.\r\n\r\nThe Three Masterpieces\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong English pastorals there are two plays, and two only, that can be\r\nsaid to stand in the front rank of the romantic drama as a whole. The\r\nfirst of these is, of course, Fletcher's _Faithful Shepherdess_. In the\r\ncase of the second the statement would perhaps be more correctly put in\r\nthe conditional mood, for whatever might have been its importance had it\r\nreached completion, the fragmentary state of Jonson's _Sad Shepherd_ has\r\nprevented its taking the place it deserves in the history of dramatic\r\nliterature. With these two productions may for the purposes of criticism\r\nbe classed Thomas Randolph's _Amyntas_, which, however inferior to the\r\nothers in poetic merit, yet like them stands apart in certain matters of\r\nintention and origin from the general run of pastorals, and may, moreover,\r\nwell support a claim to be considered one of the three chief English\r\nexamples of the kind.\r\n\r\nThese three plays embrace a period of some thirty years, before, during,\r\nand after which a considerable number of dramatic productions, more or\r\nless pastoral in character, appeared. The chief feature in which the three\r\nplays we are about to consider are distinguished from these is a certain\r\ndirect and conscious, though in no case subservient, relation they bear to\r\nthe drama of the Italians; while at the same time we are struck with the\r\nabsence of any influence of subsidiary or semi-pastoral tradition, of the\r\nmythological drama, or the courtly-chivalric romance. We shall therefore\r\ngain more by considering them in connexion with each other than we shall\r\nlose by abandoning strict chronological sequence.\r\n\r\nWhen Fletcher's play was produced, probably in the winter of 1608-9, it\r\nproved a complete failure.[264] An edition appeared without date, but\r\nbefore May, 1610, to which were prefixed verses by Field, Beaumont,\r\nChapman, and Jonson. If, as some have supposed, the last named already had\r\nat the time a pastoral play of his own in contemplation, the reception\r\naccorded to his friend's venture can hardly have been encouraging, and may\r\nhave led to the postponement of the plan; as we shall see, there is no\r\nreason to believe that the _Sad Shepherd_ was taken in hand for another\r\nquarter of a century almost. The _Faithful Shepherdess_ was revived long\r\nafter Fletcher's death, at a court performance in 1633-4, and shone by\r\ncomparison with Montagu's _Shepherds Paradise_ acted the year before. It\r\nwas then again placed on the public boards at the Blackfriars, where it\r\nmet with some measure of success.\r\n\r\nThe _Faithful Shepherdess_ was the earliest, and long remained the only,\r\ndeliberate attempt to acclimatize upon the popular stage in England a\r\npastoral drama which should occupy a position corresponding to that of\r\nTasso and Guarini in Italy. It was no crude attempt at transplantation, no\r\nmere imitation of definite models, as was the case with Daniel's work, but\r\na deliberate act of creative genius inspired by an ambitious rivalry. Its\r\nauthor might be supposed well fitted for his task. Although it was one of\r\nhis earliest, if not actually his very earliest work, it is clear that he\r\nmust have already possessed an adequate and practical knowledge of\r\nstagecraft, and have been familiar with the temper of London audiences. He\r\nfurther possessed poetical powers of no mean order, in particular a\r\nlyrical gift almost unsurpassed among his fellows for grace and sweetness,\r\nhowbeit somewhat lacking in the qualities of refinement and power. That\r\nhe should have failed so signally is a fact worth attention. For fail he\r\ndid. His friends, it is true, endeavoured as usual to explain the fiasco\r\nof the first performance by the ignorance and incompetence of the\r\nspectators, but we shall, I think, see reason to come ourselves to a\r\nscarcely less unfavourable conclusion. Nor is this failure to be explained\r\nby the inherent disadvantage at which the sentimental and lyrical pastoral\r\nstood when brought face to face with the wider and stronger interest of\r\nthe romantic drama. Such considerations may to some extent account for the\r\nattitude of the contemporary audience; they cannot be supposed seriously\r\nto affect the critical verdict of posterity. We must trust to analysis to\r\nshow wherein lay the weakness of the piece; later we may be able to\r\nsuggest some cause for Fletcher's failure.\r\n\r\nIn the first place we may consider for a moment Fletcher's indebtedness to\r\nTasso and Guarini, a question on which very different views have been\r\nheld. As to the source of his inspiration, there can be no reasonable\r\ndoubt, though it has been observed with truth by more than one critic,\r\nthat the _Faithful Shepherdess_ may more properly be regarded as written\r\nin rivalry, than in imitation, of the Italians. In any case, but for the\r\n_Aminta_ and _Pastor fido_, the _Faithful Shepherdess_ would never have\r\ncome into being; as a type it reveals neither original invention nor\r\nliterary evolution, but is a conscious attempt to adapt the Italian\r\npastoral to the requirements of the English stage. As an individual piece,\r\non the other hand, it is for the most part original and independent,\r\nlittle direct influence of the Italians being traceable in the plot,\r\nwhether in general construction or in single incidents and characters. A\r\ncertain resemblance has indeed been discovered between Guarini's Corisca\r\nand Fletcher's Cloe, but the fact chiefly shows the superficiality of the\r\ncomparison upon which critics have relied, since if Corisca suggested some\r\ntraits of Cloe, she may be held responsible for far more of Amarillis.\r\nWhere Guarini depicted a courtesan, Fletcher has painted a yahoo. Corisca,\r\nwanton and cynical, plays, like Amarillis, the part of mischief-maker and\r\ndeceiver, and, so far from seeking, like her successfully eludes the\r\nembraces of the shepherd-satyr. On the other hand, a clear difference\r\nbetween Fletcher's work and that of the Italians may be seen in the\r\nrespective use made of supernatural agencies. From these the southern\r\ndrama is comparatively free. A somewhat ultra-medicinal power of herbs,\r\nthe introduction of an oracle in the preliminary history and of a wholly\r\nsuperfluous seer in the _dénoûment_ make up the whole sum so far as the\r\n_Pastor fido_ is concerned, while the _Aminta_ cannot even show as much as\r\nthis. In the _Faithful Shepherdess_ we find not only the potent herbs,\r\nholy water, and magic taper of Clorin's bower, but the wonder-working well\r\nand the actual presence of the river-god, who rises, not to pay courtly\r\ncompliments in the prologue, but to take an actual part in the plot[265].\r\nAlike in its positive and negative aspects Fletcher's relation to the\r\nItalian masters was conscious and acknowledged. Far from feigning\r\nignorance, he boldly challenged comparison with his predecessors by\r\nimitating the very title of Guarini's play, or yet closer, had he known\r\nit, that of Contarini's _Fida ninfa_[266].\r\n\r\nA glance at the dramatis personae reveals a curious artificial symmetry\r\nwhich, as we shall shortly see, is significant of the spirit in which\r\nFletcher approached the composition of his play. In Clorin we have a nymph\r\nvowed to perpetual virginity, an anchorite at the tomb of her dead lover;\r\nin Thenot a worshipper of her constancy, whose love she cures by feigning\r\na return. In Perigot and Amoret are represented a pair of ideal lovers--so\r\nFletcher gives us to understand--in whose chaste bosoms dwell no looser\r\nflames. Amarillis is genuinely enamoured of Perigot, with a love that bids\r\nmodesty farewell, and will dare even crime and dishonour for its\r\nattainment; Cloe, as already said, is a study in erotic pathology. She is\r\nthe female counterpart of the Sullen Shepherd, who inherits the\r\ntraditional nature of the satyr, that monster having been transformed into\r\nthe gentle minister of the cloistral Clorin. So, again, the character of\r\nAmarillis finds its counterpart in that of Alexis, whose love for Cloe is\r\nat least human; while Daphnis, who meets Cloe's desperate advances with a\r\nshy innocence, is in effect, whatever he may have been in intention,\r\nhardly other than a comic character. The river-god and the satyr, the\r\npriest of Pan and his attendant Old Shepherd, who themselves stand outside\r\nthe circle of amorous intrigue, complete the list of personae.\r\n\r\nThe action which centres round these characters cannot be regarded as\r\nforming a plot in any strict sense of the term, though Fletcher has reaped\r\na little praise here and there for his construction of one. It is hardly\r\ntoo much to say that the various complications arise and are solved,\r\nleaving the situation at the end precisely as it was at the beginning.\r\nEven so may the mailed figures in some ancestral hall start into life at\r\nthe stroke of midnight, and hold high revel with the fair dames and\r\ndamsels from out the gilt frames upon the walls, content to range\r\nthemselves once more and pose in their former attitudes as soon as the\r\nfirst grey light of morning shimmers through the mullioned windows.\r\nPerigot and Amoret come through the trials of the night with their love\r\nunshaken, but apparently no nearer its fulfilment; Thenot's love for\r\nClorin is cured for the moment, but is in danger of breaking out anew when\r\nhe shall discover that she is after all constant to her vow; Cloe recovers\r\nfrom her amorous possession; the vagrant desires of Amarillis and Alexis\r\nare dispelled by the 'sage precepts' of the priest and Clorin; Daphnis'\r\ninnocence is seemingly unstained by the hours he has spent with Cloe in\r\nthe hollow tree; while the Sullen Shepherd, unregenerate and defiant, is\r\nbanished the confines of pastoral Thessaly. What we have witnessed was no\r\nmore than the comedy of errors of a midsummer night.\r\n\r\nThe play, nevertheless, possesses merits which it would be unfair to\r\nneglect. Narrative is, in the first place, entirely dispensed with in\r\nfavour of actual representation, though the result, it must be admitted,\r\nis somewhat kaleidoscopic. Next, the action is complete within itself, and\r\nneeds no previous history to explain it; no slight advantage for stage\r\nrepresentation. As a result the interest is kept constantly whetted, the\r\nmovement is brisk and varied, and with the help of the verse goes far\r\ntowards carrying off the many imperfections of the piece.\r\n\r\nIt will have been already noticed that the characters fall into certain\r\ndistinct groups which may be regarded as exemplifying certain aspects of\r\nlove. Supersensuous sentiment, chaste and honourable regard, too\r\ncolourless almost to deserve the name of love, natural and unrestrained\r\ndesire, and violent lust, all these are clearly typified. What we fail to\r\nfind is the presentment of a love which shall reveal men and women neither\r\nas beasts of instinct nor as carved figures of alabaster fit only to adorn\r\na tomb. This typical nature of the characters has given rise to a theory\r\nrecently propounded that the play should be regarded as an allegory\r\nillustrative of certain aspects of love[267]. So regarded much of the\r\nabsurdity, alike of the characters and of the action, is said to\r\ndisappear. This may be so, but does it really mean anything more than that\r\nabstractions not being in fact possessed of character at all, and being as\r\nideals unfettered by any demands of probability, absurdities pass\r\nunnoticed in their case which at the touchstone of actuality at once start\r\ninto glaring prominence? Moreover, though the _Faithful Shepherdess_ was\r\namong the first fruits of its author's genius, and though it may be\r\ncontended that he never gained a complete mastery over the difficult art\r\nof dramatic construction, Fletcher early proved his familiarity with the\r\npopular demands of the romantic stage, and was far too practical a\r\ncraftsman to be likely to add the dead-weight of a moral allegory to the\r\nalready dangerous form of the Arcadian pastoral. The theory does not in\r\nreality bring the problem presented by Fletcher's play any nearer\r\nsolution; since, if the characters are regarded solely as representing\r\nabstract ideas, such as chastity, desire, lust, they strip themselves of\r\nevery shred of dramatic interest, and could not, as Fletcher must have\r\nknown, stand the least chance upon the stage; while if they take to cover\r\ntheir nakedness however diaphanous a veil of dramatic personality, the\r\nabsurdities of character and plot at once become apparent.\r\n\r\nWhat truth there may be underlying this theory will, I think, be best\r\nexplained upon a different hypothesis. Let us in the first place\r\nendeavour, so far as may be possible after the lapse of nearly three\r\ncenturies, to realize the mental attitude of the author in approaching the\r\ncomposition of his play. In order to do this a closer analysis of the\r\npiece will be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe first point of importance for the interpretation of Fletcher's\r\npastoralism is to be found in the quaintly self-confident preface which he\r\nprefixed to the printed edition. Throughout our inquiry we have observed\r\ntwo main types of pastoral, to one or other of which all work in this kind\r\napproaches; that, namely, in which the interest depends upon some\r\nallegorical or topical meaning lying beneath and beyond the apparent form,\r\nand that in which it is confined to the actual and obvious presentment\r\nitself. Of the former type Drayton wrote in the preface to his Pastorals:\r\n'The subject of Pastorals, as the language of it, ought to be poor, silly,\r\nand of the coursest Woofe in appearance. Neverthelesse, the most High and\r\nmost Noble Matters of the World may bee shaddowed in them, and for\r\ncertaine sometimes are[268]. In his preface to the _Faithful Shepherdess_\r\nthe author adopts the opposite position, as Daniel, in the prologue to the\r\n_Queen's Arcadia_, and in spite of the strongly topical nature of that\r\npiece, had done before him. Fletcher in an often-quoted passage writes:\r\n'Understand, therefore, a pastoral to be a representation of shepherds and\r\nshepherdesses with their actions and passions, which must be such as may\r\nagree with their natures, at least not exceeding former fictions and\r\nvulgar traditions; they are not to be adorned with any art, but such\r\nimproper [i.e. common] ones as nature is said to bestow, as singing and\r\npoetry; or such as experience may teach them, as the virtues of herbs and\r\nfountains, the ordinary course of the sun, moon, and stars, and such\r\nlike.' His interest would, then, appear to lie in a more or less realistic\r\nrepresentation, and he appears more concerned to enforce a reasonable\r\npropriety of character than to discover deep matters of philosophy and\r\nstate. This passage alone would, therefore, make the theory we glanced at\r\nabove improbable. Fletcher next proceeds, in a passage of some interest in\r\nthe history of criticism: 'A tragi-comedy is not so called in respect of\r\nmirth and killing, but in respect it wants deaths, which is enough to make\r\nit no tragedy, yet brings some near it, which is enough to make it no\r\ncomedy, which must be a representation of familiar people, with such kind\r\nof trouble as no life be questioned; so that a god is as lawful in this as\r\nin a tragedy, and mean people as in a comedy.' One would hardly have\r\nsupposed it necessary to define tragi-comedy to the English public in\r\n1610, and even had it been necessary, this could hardly be accepted as a\r\nvery satisfactory definition. The audience, 'having ever had a singular\r\ngift in defining,' as the author sarcastically remarks, concluded a\r\npastoral tragi-comedy 'to be a play of country hired shepherds in gray\r\ncloaks, with curtailed dogs in strings, sometimes laughing together, and\r\nsometimes killing one another'; and after all, so far as tragi-comedy is\r\nconcerned, their belief was not unreasonable. Fletcher's definition is\r\nobviously borrowed from the academic criticism of the renaissance, and\r\nbears no relation to the living tradition of the English stage: since his\r\nplay suggests acquaintance with Guarini's _Pastor fido_, it is perhaps not\r\nfantastic to imagine that in his preface he was indebted to the same\r\nauthor's _Compendio della poesia tragicomica_. What is important to note\r\nis Fletcher's concern at this point with critical theory.\r\n\r\nWithout seeking to dogmatize as to the exact extent of Fletcher's debt to\r\nindividual Italian sources, it may safely be maintained that he was\r\nfamiliar with the writings of the masters of pastoral, and worked with his\r\neyes open: whatever modifications he introduced into traditional\r\ncharacters were the result of deliberate intention. In general, two types\r\nof love may be traced in the Italian pastoral, namely the honest human\r\ndesire of such characters as Mirtillo and Amarillis, Dorinda, Aminta, and\r\nthe more or less close approach to mere sensuality found in Corisca and\r\nthe satyrs. We nowhere find any approach to supersensuous passion,\r\nindifferent to its own consummation; Silvia and Silvio are either entirely\r\ncareless, or else touched with a genuine human love. Nor are the more\r\ntumultuous sides of human passion represented, for it is impossible so to\r\nregard Corisca's love for Mirtillo, which is at bottom nothing but the\r\ncynical caprice of the courtesan, who regards her lovers merely as so many\r\nchanges of garment--\r\n\r\n    Molti averne, uno goderne, e cangiar spesso.\r\n\r\nFletcher appears to have thought that success might lie in extending and\r\nrefining upon the gamut of love. He possessed, when he set to work, no\r\nplot ready to hand capable of determining his characters, but appears to\r\nhave selected what he considered a suitable variety of types to fill a\r\npastoral stage, not because he desired to be in any way allegorical, but\r\nbecause in such a case it was the abstract relationship among the\r\ncharacters which alone could determine his choice. Having selected his\r\ncharacters, he further seems to have left them free to evolve a plot for\r\nthemselves, a thing they signally failed to do. Thus there may be a\r\ncertain truth underlying the theory with which we started, inasmuch as the\r\ncharacters appear to have been chosen, not for any particular dramatic\r\nbusiness, but for certain abstract qualities, and some trace of their\r\norigin may yet cling about them in the accomplished work; but that\r\nFletcher deliberately intended to illustrate a set of psychological\r\nconditions, not by dramatic presentation, but by the use of types and\r\nabstractions, is to my mind incredible. In the composition of his later\r\nplays he had the necessities of a given plot, incidents, or other\r\nfashioning cause, to determine the characters which it was in its turn to\r\nillustrate, and here he showed resourceful craftsmanship. In the case of\r\nthe present play he had to fashion characters _in vacuo_ and then weave\r\nthem into such a plot as they might be capable of sustaining. In other\r\nwords, he reversed the formai order of artistic creation, and attempted to\r\nmake the abstract generate the concrete, instead of making the individual\r\nexample imply, while being informed by, the fundamental idea.\r\n\r\nSo much for the formal and theoretic side of the question. A few words as\r\nto the general tone and purpose of the play. For some reason unexplained,\r\nhaving selected his characters, which one may almost say exhibit every\r\nform of love except a wholesome and a human one, the author deemed it\r\nnecessary that the whole should redound to the praise and credit of\r\ncloistral virginity and glozing 'honour,' and whatever else of unreal\r\nsentiment the cynicism of the renaissance had grafted on the superstition\r\nof the middle age. Again comparing the _Faithful Shepherdess_ with\r\nFletcher's other work, we find that when he is dealing with actual men and\r\nwomen in his romantic plays he troubles himself little concerning the\r\nmoral which it may be possible to extract from his plot; he is rightly\r\nconscious that that at all events is not the business of art: but when he\r\ncomes to create _in vacuo_ he is at once obsessed by some Platonic theory\r\nregarding the ethical aim of the poet. The victory, therefore, shall be\r\nwith the powers of good, purity and vestal maidenhood shall triumph and\r\nundergo apotheosis at his hands, the world shall see how fair a monument\r\nof stainless womanhood he can erect in melodious verse. Well and good; for\r\nthis is indeed an object to which no self-respecting person can take\r\nexception. There was, however, one point the importance of which the\r\nauthor failed to realize, namely, that this ideal which he sought to\r\nhonour was one with which he was himself wholly out of sympathy.\r\nConsequently, in place of the supreme picture of womanly purity he\r\nintended, he produced what is no better than a grotesque caricature. His\r\ncynical indifference is not only evident from many of his other works, but\r\nconstantly forces itself upon our attention even in the present play. The\r\nfalsity of his whole position appears in the unconvincing conventionality\r\nof the patterns of chastity themselves, and in the unreality of the\r\ncharacters which serve them as foils--Cloe being utterly preposterous\r\nexcept as a study in pathlogy, and Amarillis essentially a tragic figure\r\nwho can only be tolerated on condition of her real character being\r\ncarefully veiled. It appears again in the utterly irrational conversion\r\nand purification of these characters, and we may further face it in the\r\nprofound cynicism, all the more terrible because apparently unconscious,\r\nwith which the author is content to dismiss Thenot, cured of his\r\naltruistic devotion by the shattering at one blow of all that he held most\r\nsacred in woman.\r\n\r\nIn this antagonism between Fletcher's own sympathies and the ideal he set\r\nbefore him seems to me to lie the key to the enigma of his play. Only one\r\nother rational solution is possible, namely that he intended the whole as\r\nan elaborate satire on all ideas of chastity whatever. It is hardly\r\nsurprising, under the circumstances, that one of the most persistent false\r\nnotes in the piece is that indelicacy of self-conscious virtue which we\r\nhave before observed in the case of Tasso. If on the other hand we have to\r\npronounce Fletcher free of any taint of seductive sentiment, we must\r\nnevertheless charge him with a considerable increase in that cynicism with\r\nregard to womankind in general which had by now become characteristic of\r\nthe pastoral drama. We have already noticed it in the case of Tasso's 'Or,\r\nnon sai tu com' è fatta la donna?' and of the words in which Corisca\r\ndescribes her changes of lovers, to say nothing of its appearance at the\r\nclose of the _Orfeo_. In English poetry we find Daniel writing:\r\n\r\n    Light are their waving vailes, light their attires,\r\n    Light are their heads, and lighter their desires;\r\n                                    (_Queen's Arcadia_, II. iii.)\r\n\r\nwhile with Fletcher the charge becomes yet more bitter. Thenot,\r\ncontemplating the constancy of Clorin, is amazed\r\n\r\n         that such virtue can\r\n    Be resident in lesser than a man, (II. ii. 83,)\r\n\r\nor that any should be found capable of mastering the suggestions of\r\ncaprice\r\n\r\n    And that great god of women, appetite. (ib. 146.)\r\n\r\nAmarillis, courting Perigot, asks in scorn:\r\n\r\n    Still think'st thou such a thing as chastity\r\n    Is amongst women? (III. i. 297.)\r\n\r\nThe Sullen Shepherd declares of the wounded Amoret:\r\n\r\n         Thou wert not meant,\r\n    Sure, for a woman, thou art so innocent; (ib. 358.)\r\n\r\nand sums up his opinion of the sex in the words:\r\n\r\n    Women love only opportunity\r\n    And not the man. (ib. 127.)\r\n\r\nSo Fletcher wrote, and in the same mood the arch-cynic of a later age\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n    ev'ry Woman is at heart a Rake!\r\n\r\nBut it is high time to inquire how it is, supposing the objections we have\r\nbeen considering to be justly chargeable against the _Faithful\r\nShepherdess_, that it should ever have come to be regarded as a classic of\r\nthe language, that it should be by far the most widely known of its\r\nauthor's works, and that we should find ourselves turning to it again and\r\nagain with ever-fresh delight. The reader has doubtless already answered\r\nthe question. Fletcher brought to the composition of his play a gift of\r\neasy lyric versification, a command of varied rhythm, and a felicity of\r\nphrase, allusion, recollection, and echo, such as have seldom been\r\nsurpassed. The wealth of pure poetry overflowing in every scene is of\r\npower to make us readily forget the host of objections which serious\r\ncriticism must raise, and revel with mere delight in the verbal melody.\r\nThe play is literally crowded with incidental sketches of exquisite beauty\r\nwhich suggest comparison with the more set descriptions of Tasso, and\r\nflash past on the speed of the verse as the flowers of the roadside and\r\nglimpses of the distant landscape through breaks in the hedge flash for\r\nan instant on the gaze of the rider[269].\r\n\r\nBefore passing on, and in spite of the fact that the play must be familiar\r\nto most readers, I here transcribe a few of its most fascinating passages\r\nas the best defence Fletcher has to oppose to the objections of his\r\ncritics. It is in truth no lame one[270].\r\n\r\nIn the opening scene Clorin, who has vowed herself to a life of chastity\r\nat the grave of her lover, is met by the satyr, who at once bows in\r\nworship of her beauty. He has been sent by Pan to fetch fruits for the\r\nentertainment of 'His paramour the Syrinx bright.' 'But behold a fairer\r\nsight!' he exclaims on seeing Clorin:\r\n\r\n    By that heavenly form of thine,\r\n    Brightest fair, thou art divine,\r\n    Sprung from great immortal race\r\n    Of the gods, for in thy face\r\n    Shines more awful majesty\r\n    Than dull weak mortality\r\n    Dare with misty eyes behold\r\n    And live. Therefore on this mould\r\n    Lowly do I bend my knee\r\n    In worship of thy deity.[271] (I. i. 58.)\r\n\r\nThe next scene takes place in the neighbourhood of the village. At the\r\nconclusion of a festival we find the priest pronouncing blessing upon the\r\nassembled people and purging them with holy water[272], after which they\r\ndisperse with a song. As they are going, Perigot stays Amoret, begging\r\nher to lend an ear to his suit. He addresses her:\r\n\r\n                    Oh you are fairer far\r\n    Than the chaste blushing morn, or that fair star\r\n    That guides the wandering seaman through the deep,\r\n    Straighter than straightest pine upon the steep\r\n    Head of an agèd mountain, and more white\r\n    Than the new milk we strip before day-light\r\n    From the full-freighted bags of our fair flocks,\r\n    Your hair more beauteous than those hanging locks\r\n    Of young Apollo! (I. ii. 60.)\r\n\r\nThey agree to meet by night in the neighbouring wood, there to bind their\r\nlove with mutual vows. The tryst is set where\r\n\r\n           to that holy wood is consecrate\r\n    A virtuous well, about whose flowery banks\r\n    The nimble-footed fairies dance their rounds\r\n    By the pale moonshine, dipping oftentimes\r\n    Their stolen children, so to make them free\r\n    From dying flesh and dull mortality.\r\n    By this fair fount hath many a shepherd sworn,\r\n    And given away his freedom, many a troth\r\n    Been plight, which neither envy nor old time\r\n    Could ever break, with many a chaste kiss given\r\n    In hope of coming happiness.\r\n    By this fresh fountain many a blushing maid\r\n    Hath crown'd the head of her long-lovèd shepherd\r\n    With gaudy flowers, whilst he happy sung\r\n    Lays of his love and dear captivity. (I. ii. 99.)\r\n\r\nCloe, repulsed by Thenot, sings her roguishly wanton carol:\r\n\r\n         Come, shepherds, come!\r\n            Come away\r\n            Without delay,\r\n    Whilst the gentle time doth stay.\r\n         Green woods are dumb,\r\n    And will never tell to any\r\n    Those dear kisses, and those many\r\n    Sweet embraces, that are given;\r\n    Dainty pleasures, that would even\r\n    Raise in coldest age a fire\r\n    And give virgin blood desire\r\n\r\n    Then if ever,\r\n       Now or never,\r\n    Come and have it;\r\n       Think not I\r\n       Dare deny\r\n    If you crave it. (I. iii. 71.)\r\n\r\nHer fortune with the modest Daphnis is scarcely better, and she is just\r\nlamenting the coldness of men when Alexis enters and forthwith accosts her\r\nwith his fervent suit. She agrees, with a pretty show of yielding modesty:\r\n\r\n                        lend me all thy red,\r\n    Thou shame-fac'd Morning, when from Tithon's bed\r\n    Thou risest ever maiden! (ib. 176.)\r\n\r\nThe second act opens with the exquisite evensong of the priest:\r\n\r\n    Shepherds all and maidens fair,\r\n    Fold your flocks up, for the air\r\n    'Gins to thicken, and the sun\r\n    Already his great course hath run.\r\n    See the dew-drops how they kiss\r\n    Every little flower that is,\r\n    Hanging on their velvet heads\r\n    Like a rope of crystal beads;\r\n    See the heavy clouds low falling,\r\n    And bright Hesperus down calling\r\n    The dead night from under ground,\r\n    At whose rising mists unsound,\r\n    Damps and vapours fly apace,\r\n    Hovering o'er the wanton face\r\n    Of these pastures, where they come\r\n    Striking dead both bud and bloom. (II. i. 1.)\r\n\r\nIn the following scene Thenot declares to Clorin his singular passion,\r\nfounded upon admiration of her constancy to her dead lover. He too can\r\nplead his love in verse of no ordinary strain:\r\n\r\n                 'Tis not the white or red\r\n    Inhabits in your cheek that thus can wed\r\n    My mind to adoration, nor your eye,\r\n    Though it be full and fair, your forehead high\r\n    And smooth as Pelops' shoulder; not the smile\r\n    Lies watching in those dimples to beguile\r\n    The easy soul, your hands and fingers long\r\n    With veins enamell'd richly, nor your tongue,\r\n    Though it spoke sweeter than Arion's harp;\r\n    Your hair woven in many a curious warp,\r\n    Able in endless error to enfold\r\n    The wandering soul; not the true perfect mould\r\n    Of all your body, which as pure doth shew\r\n    In maiden whiteness as the Alpen snow:\r\n    All these, were but your constancy away,\r\n    Would please me less than the black stormy day\r\n    The wretched seaman toiling through the deep.\r\n    But, whilst this honour'd strictness you do keep,\r\n    Though all the plagues that e'er begotten were\r\n    In the great womb of air were settled here,\r\n    In opposition, I would, like the tree,\r\n    Shake off those drops of weakness, and be free\r\n    Even in the arm of danger. (II. ii. 116.)\r\n\r\nThe last lines, however fine in themselves, are utterly out of place in\r\nthe mouth of this morbid sentimentalist. They breath the brave spirit of\r\nChapman's outburst:\r\n\r\n    Give me a spirit that on this life's rough sea\r\n    Loves t'have his sails fill'd with a lusty wind,\r\n    Even till his sail-yards tremble, his masts crack,\r\n    And his rapt ship run on her side so low\r\n    That she drinks water and her keel plows air.\r\n                             (_Byron's Conspiracy_, III. i.)\r\n\r\nInto the details of the night's adventures there is no call for us to\r\nenter; it will be sufficient to detach a few passages from their setting,\r\nwhich can usually be done without material injury. The whole scenery of\r\nthe wood, in the densest thicket of which Pan is feasting with his\r\nmistress, while about their close retreat the satyr keeps watch and ward,\r\nmingling now and again in the action of the mortals, is strongly\r\nreminiscent of the _Midsummer Night's Dream_. The wild-wood minister thus\r\ndescribes his charge in the octosyllabic couplets which constitute such a\r\ncharacteristic of the play:\r\n\r\n    Now, whilst the moon doth rule the sky,\r\n    And the stars, whose feeble light\r\n    Give a pale shadow to the night,\r\n    Are up, great Pan commanded me\r\n    To walk this grove about, whilst he,\r\n    In a corner of the wood\r\n    Where never mortal foot hath stood,\r\n    Keeps dancing, music and a feast\r\n    To entertain a lovely guest;\r\n    Where he gives her many a rose\r\n    Sweeter than the breath that blows\r\n    The leaves, grapes, berries of the best;\r\n    I never saw so great a feast.\r\n    But to my charge. Here must I stay\r\n    To see what mortals lose their way,\r\n    And by a false fire, seeming-bright,\r\n    Train them in and leave them right. (III. i. 167.)\r\n\r\nPerigot's musing when he meets Amoret and supposes her to be the\r\ntransformed Amarillis is well conceived; he greets her:\r\n\r\n             What art thou dare\r\n    Tread these forbidden paths, where death and care\r\n    Dwell on the face of darkness? (IV. iv. 15.)\r\n\r\nwhile not less admirable is the pathos of Amoret's pleading; how she had\r\n\r\n         lov'd thee dearer than mine eyes, or that\r\n    Which we esteem our honour, virgin state;\r\n    Dearer than swallows love the early morn,\r\n    Or dogs of chase the sound of merry horn;\r\n    Dearer than thou canst love thy new love, if thou hast\r\n    Another, and far dearer than the last;\r\n    Dearer than thou canst love thyself, though all\r\n    The self-love were within thee that did fall\r\n    With that coy swain that now is made a flower,\r\n    For whose dear sake Echo weeps many a shower!...\r\n    Come, thou forsaken willow, wind my head,\r\n    And noise it to the world, my love is dead! (ib. 102.)\r\n\r\nThen again we have the lines in which the satyr heralds the early dawn:\r\n\r\n    See, the day begins to break,\r\n    And the light shoots like a streak\r\n    Of subtle fire; the wind blows cold\r\n    Whilst the morning doth unfold.\r\n    Now the birds begin to rouse,\r\n    And the squirrel from the boughs\r\n    Leaps to get him nuts and fruit;\r\n    The early lark, that erst was mute,\r\n    Carols to the rising day\r\n    Many a note and many a lay. (ib. 165.)\r\n\r\nThe last act, with its obligation to wind up such loose threads of action\r\nas have been spun in the course of the play, is perhaps somewhat lacking\r\nin passages of particular beauty, but it yields us Amarillis' prayer as\r\nshe flies from the Sullen Shepherd, and the final speech of the satyr.\r\nHowever out of keeping with character the former of these may be, it is in\r\nitself unsurpassed:\r\n\r\n      If there be\r\n    Ever a neighbour-brook or hollow tree,\r\n    Receive my body, close me up from lust\r\n    That follows at my heels! Be ever just,\r\n    Thou god of shepherds, Pan, for her dear sake\r\n    That loves the rivers' brinks, and still doth shake\r\n    In cold remembrance of thy quick pursuit;\r\n    Let me be made a reed, and, ever mute,\r\n    Nod to the waters' fall, whilst every blast\r\n    Sings through my slender leaves that I was chaste!\r\n                                          (V. iii. 79.)\r\n\r\nLastly, we have the satyr's farewell to Clorin:\r\n\r\n      Thou divinest, fairest, brightest,\r\n      Thou most powerful maid and whitest,\r\n      Thou most virtuous and most blessèd,\r\n      Eyes of stars, and golden-tressèd\r\n      Like Apollo; tell me, sweetest,\r\n      What new service now is meetest\r\n      For the satyr? Shall I stray\r\n      In the middle air, and stay\r\n      The sailing rack, or nimbly take\r\n      Hold by the moon, and gently make\r\n      Suit to the pale queen of night\r\n      For a beam to give thee light?\r\n      Shall I dive into the sea\r\n      And bring thee coral, making way\r\n      Through the rising waves that fall\r\n      In snowy fleeces? Dearest, shall\r\n      I catch thee wanton fawns, or flies\r\n      Whose woven wings the summer dyes\r\n      Of many colours? get thee fruit,\r\n      Or steal from heaven old Orpheus' lute?\r\n      All these I'll venture for, and more,\r\n    To do her service all these woods adore.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      So I take my leave and pray\r\n      All the comforts of the day,\r\n      Such as Phoebus' heat doth send\r\n      On the earth, may still befriend\r\n      Thee and this arbour!\r\n    _Clorin._         And to thee,\r\n      All thy master's love be free! (V. v. 238 and 268.)\r\n\r\nSuch then is Fletcher's play. It is in the main original so far as its own\r\nindividuality is concerned, and apart from the general tradition which it\r\nfollows. Its direct debt to Guarini is confined to the title and certain\r\ntraits in the characters of Cloe and Amarillis. Further indebtedness has,\r\nit is true, been found to Spenser, but some hint of the transformation of\r\nAmarillis, a few names and an occasional reminiscence, make up the sum\r\ntotal of specific obligations. Endowed with a poetic gift which far\r\nsurpassed the imitative facility of Guarini and approached the consummate\r\nart of Tasso himself, Fletcher attempted to rival the Arcadian drama of\r\nthe Italians. Not content, as Daniel had been, merely to reproduce upon\r\naccepted models, he realized that some fundamental innovation was\r\nnecessary. But while he adopted and justified the greater licence and\r\nrange of effect allowed upon the English stage, thereby altering the form\r\nfrom pseudo-classical to wholly romantic, he failed in any way to touch or\r\nvitalize the inner spirit of the kind, trusting merely to lively action\r\nand lyrical jewellery to hold the attention of his audience. He failed,\r\nand it was not till some years after his death that the play, having been\r\nstamped with the approbation of the court, won a tardy recognition from\r\nthe general public; and even when, after the restoration, Pepys records a\r\nsuccessful revival in 1663, he adds that it was 'much thronged after for\r\nthe scene's sake[273].'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nRandolph's play, entitled 'Amyntas, or the Impossible Dowry,' belongs no\r\ndoubt to the few years that intervened between the author's exchanging the\r\nacademic quiet of Cambridge and the courts of Trinity, of which college he\r\nwas a fellow, for the life and bustle of theatre and tavern in London\r\nabout 1632, and his premature death which took place in March, 1635,\r\nbefore he had completed his thirtieth year. It is tempting to imagine that\r\nthe revival of Fletcher's play on Twelfth Night, 1633-4, may possibly have\r\noccasioned Randolph's attempt, in which case the play must belong to the\r\nvery last year of his life; but though there is nothing to make this\r\nsupposition improbable, pastoral representations were far too general at\r\nthat date for it to be necessary to look for any specific suggestion. The\r\nplay first appeared in print in the collected edition of the author's\r\npoems edited by his brother in 1638.\r\n\r\nLike Fletcher's play, the _Amyntas_ is a conscious attempt at so altering\r\nthe accepted type of the Arcadian pastoral as to fit it for representation\r\non the popular stage, for though acted, as the title-page informs us,\r\nbefore their Majesties at Whitehall, it was probably also performed and\r\nintended by the author for performance on the public boards[274]. Yet the\r\ntwo experiments differ widely. Fletcher, as we have seen, while completing\r\nthe romanticizing of the pastoral by employing the machinery and\r\nconventions of the English instead of the classical stage, nevertheless\r\nintroduced into his play none of the diversity and breadth of interest\r\ncommonly found in the romantic drama proper, and indeed the _Faithful\r\nShepherdess_ lacks almost entirely even that elaboration and firmness of\r\nplot which we find in the _Pastor fido_. Randolph, on the other hand,\r\nchose a plot closely resembling Guarini's in structure, and even retained\r\nmuch of the scenic arrangement of the Italian theatre. But in the\r\ncomplexity of action and multiplicity of incident, in the comedy of\r\ncertain scenes and the substratum of pure farce in others, he introduced\r\nelements of the popular drama of a nature powerfully to affect the essence\r\nof his production. Where Fletcher substituted for a theoretic classicism\r\nan academic romanticism, Randolph insisted on treating the venerable\r\nproprieties of the pastoral according to the traditions of English\r\nmelodrama.\r\n\r\nLike the _Pastor fido_[275], Randolph's _Amyntas_ is weighted with a\r\npreliminary history. Philaebus, the son of the archiflamen Pilumnus, was\r\nbetrothed to the shepherdess Lalage, who, however, was captivated by the\r\ngreater wealth of the shepherd Claius, upon whom she bestowed her hand.\r\nMoved by his son's grief, Pilumnus entreated Ceres' revenge on the\r\nfaithless nymph, and Lalage died in giving birth to the twins Amyntas and\r\nAmarillis. This but added to Philaebus' despair, so that he died upon her\r\ntomb, and the bereft father having once more sought the aid of the\r\ngoddess, the oracle pronounced the curse:\r\n\r\n    Sicilian swaines, ill luck shall long betide\r\n    To every bridegroome, and to every bride:\r\n    No sacrifice, no vow shall still mine Ire,\r\n    Till Claius blood both quench and kindle fire.\r\n    The wise shall misconceive me, and the wit\r\n    Scornd and neglected shall my meaning hit. (I. v.)\r\n\r\nUpon this Claius fled, leaving his children in the care of his sister\r\nThestylis. Although Philaebus was dead, two younger children remained to\r\nPilumnus, Damon and Urania. In the course of years it fortuned that Urania\r\nand Amyntas fell in love, and though misliking of the match, Pilumnus went\r\nso far as to consult the oracle concerning his daughter's dowry. With the\r\nuncalled-for perversity characteristic of oracles the 'ompha[276]'\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n    That which thou hast not, mayst not, canst not have\r\n    Amyntas, is the Dowry that I crave:\r\n    Rest hopelesse in thy love, or else divine\r\n    To give Urania this, and she is thine.\r\n\r\nPondering whereon Amyntas lost his wits. In the meanwhile Amarillis had\r\nconceived an unhappy passion for Damon, who in his turn sought the love\r\nof the nymph Laurinda, having for rival Alexis.\r\n\r\nThis is the situation at the opening of the action. In the first act we\r\nfind Laurinda unable or unwilling to decide between her rival lovers, and\r\nher endeavours to play them off one against the other afford some of the\r\nmost amusing scenes of the piece. Learning from Thestylis of Amarillis'\r\nlove for Damon, she determines on a trick whereby she hopes to make her\r\nchoice without appearing to slight either of her suitors. She bids them\r\nabide by the award of the first nymph they meet at the temple in the\r\nmorning, and so arranges matters that that nymph shall be Amarillis, whose\r\nlove for Damon she supposes will move her to appoint Alexis for herself.\r\nIn the meanwhile the banished Claius has returned, in order, having heard\r\nof Amyntas' madness, to apply such cures as he has learnt in the course of\r\nhis wanderings. He is successful in his attempt, and without revealing his\r\nidentity departs, having first privately obtained from Urania the promise\r\nthat she will vow virginity to Ceres, lest Amyntas by puzzling afresh over\r\nthe oracle should again lose his reason. The nymphs now appear at the\r\ntemple, and the foremost, who is veiled, is appealed to by Damon and\r\nAlexis to give her decision. She reveals herself as Amarillis, and Damon,\r\nfearing that she will decide against him, refuses to be bound by the award\r\nof so partial an arbiter. Alexis thereupon goes off to fetch Laurinda, who\r\nshall force him to abide by his oath, while Damon in a fit of rage seeks\r\nto prevent Amarillis' verdict by slaying her. He wounds her with his spear\r\nand leaves her for dead. She recovers consciousness, however, when he has\r\nfled, and with her blood writes a letter to Laurinda bequeathing to her\r\nall interest in Damon. At this point Claius returns upon the scene, and\r\nfinding her wounded applies remedies. Damon too is led back by an evil\r\nconscience, and Pilumnus likewise appears. Claius, in his anxiety to make\r\nAmarillis reveal her assassin, betrays his own identity, to the joy of his\r\nold enemy Pilumnus. Alexis now returns with Laurinda, and upon hearing the\r\nletter which Amarillis had written, Damon confesses his crime and declares\r\nthat henceforth his love is for none but her. His life, however, is\r\nforfeit through his having shed blood in the holy vale, and he is led off\r\nin company with Claius to die at the altar of Ceres. In the fifth act we\r\nfind all prepared for the double sacrifice, when Amyntas enters, and\r\nbidding Pilumnus stay his hand, claims to expound the oracle. Claius'\r\nblood, he argues, has been already shed in Amarillis, and has quenched the\r\nfire of Damon's love for Laurinda, rekindling it again to Amarillis' self.\r\nMoreover, had not the oracle warned them that the recognized guardians of\r\nwisdom would fail to interpret truly, and that such a scorned wit as that\r\nof the 'mad Amyntas' would discover the meaning? Furthermore, he argues\r\nthat since Amarillis was the victim the goddess aimed at, her blood might\r\nwithout sin be shed even in the holy vale, while Damon is of the priestly\r\nstock to which that office justly pertained. Thus Claius and Damon are\r\nalike spoken free, and Sicily is relieved of the goddess' curse. While the\r\ngeneral rejoicing is at its height, Urania is brought in to take her\r\nvestal vows at the altar. In spite of her lover's remonstrance she kneels\r\nbefore the shrine and addresses her prayer to the goddess. At length the\r\nappeased deity deigns to answer, and in a gracious echo reveals the\r\nsolution of the enigma of the dowry--a husband.\r\n\r\nThis plot is a mingling of comedy in the scenes of Laurinda's\r\n'wavering'[277] and the 'humours' of Amyntas' madness, and of tragi-comedy\r\nin the catastrophe. But besides this there is what may best be described\r\nas an antiplot of pure farce, in which the main character is the roguish\r\npage Dorylas, who in the guise of Oberon robs Jocastus' orchard, tricks\r\nThestylis into marrying the foolish augur, and gulls everybody all round.\r\nThe humour of this portion of the piece may be occasionally a trifle broad\r\nand at the same time childish, but there is nevertheless no denying the\r\ngenuineness of the quality, while the verse is as a rule sparkling, and\r\nthe dialogue both racy and pointed, occasionally displaying qualities\r\nhardly to be described as other than brilliant.\r\n\r\nThis comic subplot obviously owes nothing to Guarini, but is introduced\r\nin accordance with the usage of the English popular drama, and is grafted\r\nsomewhat boldly on to the conventional stock. Dorylas is one of the most\r\ninimitable and successful of the descendants of Lyly's pages; while the\r\ncharacters of Mopsus and Jocastus, although the former no doubt owes his\r\nconception to a hint in the _Aminta_, belong essentially to the English\r\nromantic farce. The scenes in which the page appears as Oberon surrounded\r\nby his court recall the introduction of the 'mortal fairies' of the _Merry\r\nWives,_ and that in which Amyntas' 'deluded fancy' takes the augur for a\r\nhound of Actaeon's breed may owe something to a passage in _King Lear_.\r\nBut even apart from the elements of farce and comedy there are important\r\naspects in which the _Amyntas_ severs itself from the stricter tradition\r\nof the Italian pastoral. Randolph, while adopting the machinery and much\r\nof the scenic environment of Guarini's play, made certain not unimportant\r\nalterations in the dramatic construction, tending towards greater variety\r\nand complicity. In the _Pastor fido_ the four main characters, though they\r\nultimately resolve themselves into two pairs, are throughout\r\ninterdependent, and their story forms but a single plot. That the play\r\nshould have needed a double solution, the events that bring two couples\r\ntogether having no connexion with one another, was a dramatic blunder but\r\nimperfectly concealed by the fact that Silvio and Dorinda are purely\r\nsecondary, the whole interest being concentrated on the fortunes of\r\nMirtillo and Amarilli. In Randolph's play, on the other hand, there are no\r\nless than six important characters. These are divided into two groups,\r\neach with an independent plot, one of which contains a telling though\r\nsomewhat conventional περιπέτεια, while the other, though possessing\r\noriginality and pathos, is lacking in dramatic possibilities. Thus each\r\nsupplies the elements wanting in the other, and if woven together\r\nharmoniously, should have been capable of forming the basis of a\r\nwell-constructed play. The first of these groups consists of Laurinda,\r\nAlexis, Damon, and Amarillis, the last two being really the dramatically\r\nimportant ones, though their fortunes are connected throughout. It is\r\nLaurinda's choice of Alexis that leads to the union of Damon and\r\nAmarillis, and it is not till Damon has unconsciously fulfilled the oracle\r\nand been freed by its interpretation, that the loves of Laurinda and\r\nAlexis can hope for a happy event. Thus Randolph has at least not fallen\r\ninto the error by which Guarini introduced a double catastrophe into a\r\nsingle plot, though he has not altogether avoided a somewhat similar\r\ndanger. This is due to the other group above mentioned, consisting of\r\nAmyntas and Urania, who, so far as the plot is concerned, are absolutely\r\nindependent of the other characters. Their own story is essentially\r\nundramatic, although it possesses qualities which would make it effective\r\nin narrative; and it is, moreover, wholly unaffected by the solution of\r\nthe other plot. This is obviously a weak place in the construction of the\r\nplay, but the author has shown great resource in meeting the difficulty.\r\nFirst, by placing the interpretation of the oracle in the mouth of\r\nAmyntas, who must yet himself remain hopeless amid the general rejoicing,\r\nhe has produced a figure of considerable dramatic effect, and so kept the\r\nattention of the audience braced, and stayed the relaxing effect of the\r\nanti-climax. Secondly, he has amused the spectators with some excellent\r\nfooling until, while Io and Paean are yet resounding, it is possible to\r\ncrown the whole by the solution of the second oracle, and send the hero\r\nand his love to join the others in the festive throng. The imperfection of\r\nplot is there, but the author has been skilful in concealing it, and it\r\nmay well be that his success would appear all the greater were his play to\r\nbe put to the real test of dramatic composition by being actually placed\r\non the boards.\r\n\r\nBut there is yet another point in which the _Amyntas_ differs not only\r\nfrom its Italian model but from its English predecessors likewise. This is\r\na certain genially humorous conception of the whole, quite apart from and\r\nbeyond the mere introduction of comedy and farce, which we have never\r\nfound so marked before, and which has indeed been painfully absent from\r\nthe pastoral since Tasso penned the final chorus of the _Aminta_. This\r\nhumorous tone is never harshly forced upon the attention, and consists, in\r\na measure, merely in the fact of the comic business constantly elbowing\r\nthe serious action, and thus saving the latter from the danger of becoming\r\nstilted and pretentions--a fault not less commonly and quite as justly\r\ncharged against pastoral literature as that of artificiality. A leaven of\r\nhumour is the great safeguard against an author taking either himself or\r\nhis creations too seriously. Randolph's _Amyntas_, it is true, renounces\r\nthe high ideality of its predecessors, of the _Aminta_ and the _Pastor\r\nfido_, of _Hymen's Triumph_ and the _Faithful Shepherdess_; but it makes\r\nup for it by human sanity of feeling and expression, by good humour and by\r\nwit. It is, moreover, genuinely diverting. Here at least we find no\r\nendeavour to attain to the importance and solemnity of a classical tragedy\r\nas with Guarini, nor a striving after an utterly unreal, unsympathetic and\r\nimpossible ideal as with Fletcher. It is, moreover, noticeable and\r\neminently to the credit of the author that the comic scenes, even when\r\nsomewhat extravagant alike in tone and proportion, seldom clash\r\nunpleasantly with the more serious passages, nor derogate from the\r\ninterest and dignity of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe play has generally met with a far from deserved neglect, owing in part\r\nno doubt to the singular failure on the part of most critics to apprehend\r\ncorrectly the nature and conditions of pastoral poetry.[278] Mr. W. C.\r\nHazlitt, who edited Randolph's works in 1875, does not so much as mention\r\nthe play in the perfunctory introduction, in which he chiefly follows the\r\nextravagant, pedantic, and utterly worthless article in the sixth volume\r\nof the _Retrospective Review_.[279] The merits of the piece have been\r\nsomewhat more fully recognized by Dr. Ward and Mr. Homer Smith, but the\r\ntreatment accorded the play by the former is necessarily scanty, while\r\nthat of the latter is inaccurate. Throughout a tendency is manifest to\r\nfind fault with the artificiality of the piece, and to blame the author\r\nfor not representing the true 'simplicity' of pastoral life. That the\r\npastoral tradition was a wholly impossible, not to say an absurd one,\r\nbearing no true relation to nature at all, may be admitted; and it may be\r\nlamented by such as love to shed bitter tears because the sandy shore is\r\nnot a well-swept parquet, or because anything you please is not something\r\nelse to which it bears not the smallest resemblance. It may or may not be\r\nunfortunate that Randolph should have elected to write _more pastorali_,\r\nbut to censure the individual work because it is not of a type to which\r\nits author never had the remotest intention of making it conform, and to\r\nwhich except for something like a miracle it was impossible that it should\r\neven approach, is the acme of critical fatuity. Judged in accordance with\r\nthe intention of the author the _Amyntas_ is no inconsiderable achievement\r\nfor a young writer, and compared with other works belonging to the same\r\ntradition it occupies a highly respectable place. With Tasso's _Aminta_\r\nand Fletcher's _Faithful Shepherdess_ it cannot, in point of poetic merit,\r\nfor one moment compare, falling as far below them in this as it surpasses\r\nthem in complexity and general suitability of dramatic construction. A\r\nfairer comparison may be made between it and the _Pastor fido_ in Italian\r\nor _Hymen's Triumph_ in English, and here again, though certainly with\r\nregard to the former and probably with regard to the latter it stands\r\nsecond as poetry, as a play it is decidedly better suited than either for\r\nrepresentation on the stage--at least on a stage with the traditions and\r\nconventions which prevailed in this country in the author's day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is then in the matter of the poetical quality of the verse that\r\nRandolph's play appears to least advantage. Living in a polished and\r\ncultured literary circle at Cambridge, and enjoying after his remove to\r\nLondon the congenial fellowship of the tribe of Ben, he naturally attained\r\nthe ease and skill necessary to maintain a respectable level of\r\ncomposition, but he was sparing of the higher flights. He seldom strikes\r\nthe attention by those purple patches which make many of his\r\ncontemporaries so quotable, yet, while by no means monotonously correct,\r\nit is equally seldom that he sinks much below his general level. The\r\ndialogue is on the whole natural and easy, and at the same time crisp and\r\npointed. A few of the more distinctively poetic and imaginative passages\r\nmay be quoted, in order to give some idea of the style. Laurinda thus\r\nappoints a choice to her brace of lovers:\r\n\r\n    I have protested never to disclose\r\n    Which 'tis that best I love: But the first Nymph,\r\n    As soone as Titan guilds the Easterne hills,\r\n    And chirping birds, the Saints-bell of the day,\r\n    Ring in our eares a warning to devotion--\r\n    That lucky damsell what so e're she be\r\n    [That first shall meet you from the temple gate][280]\r\n    Shall be the Goddesse to appoint my love,\r\n    To say, 'Laurinda this shall be your choice':\r\n    And both shall sweare to stand to her award! (III. i.)\r\n\r\nAnother passage of deliberate poetic elaboration is the monologue of\r\nClaius on once again treading his native soil:\r\n\r\n    I see the smoake steame from the Cottage tops,\r\n    The fearfull huswife rakes the embers up,\r\n    All hush to bed. Sure, no man will disturbe mee.\r\n    O blessed vally! I the wretched Claius\r\n    Salute thy happy soyle, I that have liv'd\r\n    Pelted with angry curses in a place\r\n    As horrid as my griefes, the Lylibaean mountaines,\r\n    These sixteene frozen winters; there have I\r\n    Beene with rude out-lawes, living by such sinnes\r\n    As runne o' th' score with justice 'gainst my prayers and wishes:\r\n    And when I would have tumbled down a rock,\r\n    Some secret powre restrain'd me. (III. ii.)\r\n\r\nBy far the greater part of the play is in blank verse, but in a few\r\npassages, particularly in certain dialogues tending to stichomythia, the\r\nverse is pointed, so to speak, with rime. The following is a graceful\r\nexample in a somewhat conceited vein; the transition, moreover, from\r\nblank to rimed measure has an appearance of natural ease. The rivals are\r\nawaiting the arbitrement of their love:\r\n\r\n    _Alexis._     How early, Damon,\r\n    Doe lovers rise!...\r\n\r\n    _Damon._       No Larkes so soon, Alexis.\r\n\r\n    _Al._ He that of us shall have Laurinda, Damon,\r\n    Will not be up so soone: ha! would you Damon?\r\n\r\n    _Da._ Alexis, no; but if I misse Laurinda,\r\n    My sleepe shall be eternall.\r\n\r\n    _Al._ I much wonder the Sunne so soone can rise!\r\n\r\n    _Da._ Did he lay his head in faire Laurinda's lap,\r\n    We should have but short daies.\r\n\r\n    _Al._                      No summer, Damon.\r\n\r\n    _Da._ Thetis[281] to her is browne.\r\n\r\n    _Al._                              And he doth rise\r\n    From her to gaze on faire Laurinda's eyes....\r\n\r\n    _Da._ I heare no noise of any yet that move.\r\n\r\n    _Al._ Devotion's not so early up as love.\r\n\r\n    _Da._ See how Aurora blushes! we suppose\r\n    Where Tithon lay to night.\r\n\r\n    _Al._                 That modest rose\r\n    He grafted there.\r\n\r\n    _Da._        O heaven, 'tis all I seeke,\r\n    To make that colour in Laurinda's cheeke. (IV. iv.)\r\n\r\nA more tragic note is struck in the speech in which Claius retorts on\r\nPilumnus after his discovery:\r\n\r\n    I, glut your hate, Pilumnus; let your soule\r\n    That has so long thirsted to drinke my blood,\r\n    Swill till my veines are empty;... I have stood\r\n    Long like a fatall oake, at which great Jove\r\n    Levels his thunder; all my boughes long since\r\n    Blasted and wither'd; now the trunke falls too.\r\n    Heaven end thy wrath in mee! (IV. viii.)\r\n\r\nIn some of these 'high tragical endeavours,' and notably in Damon's\r\nconfession, we do indeed find a certain stiltedness, but even here there\r\nrings a true note of pathos in the farewell:\r\n\r\n                         Amarillis,\r\n    I goe to write my story of repentance\r\n    With the same inke, wherewith thou wrotes before\r\n    The legend of thy love. (IV. ix.)\r\n\r\nThese passages will serve to give a fair and not unfavourable impression\r\nof the style, but I have reserved for separate consideration what I\r\nconsider to be the most striking portions of the play. The first of these\r\nis the string of Latin songs in which the would-be elves comment on their\r\nnefarious proceedings in Jocastus' orchard. I quote certain stanzas only:\r\n\r\n    Nos beata Fauni Proles,\r\n    Quibus non est magna moles,\r\n    Quamvis Lunam incolamus,\r\n    Hortos saepe frequentamus.\r\n\r\n    Furto cuncta magis bella,\r\n    Furto dulcior Puella,\r\n    Furto omnia decora,\r\n    Furto poma dulciora.\r\n\r\n    Cum mortales lecto jacent,\r\n    Nobis poma noctu placent;\r\n    Illa tamen sunt ingrata,\r\n    Nisi furto sint parata.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Oberon, descende citus,\r\n    Ne cogaris hinc invitus;\r\n    Canes audio latrantes,\r\n    Et mortales vigilantes.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I domum, Oberon, ad illas\r\n    Quae nos manent nunc ancillas,\r\n    Quarum osculemur sinum,\r\n    Inter poma, lac et vinum. (III. iv.)\r\n\r\nTo discuss verses such as these seriously is impossible. The dog-Latin of\r\nthe fellow of Trinity is inimitable, while there is a peculiarly roguish\r\ndelicacy about his humour. In the admirable ease with which the words are\r\nadapted to the sense, the songs are unsurpassed except by the very best of\r\nthe _carmina vagorum_. Lastly, as undoubtedly the finest passage of the\r\nplay, and as one that must give us pause when we would deny to 'prince\r\nRandolph' the gifts requisite for the higher imaginative drama, I must\r\nquote the scene in which the distracted Amyntas fancies that in his\r\nendless search for the 'impossible dowry' he has arrived on the shores of\r\nStyx and boarded Charon's bark.\r\n\r\n    _Amyntas._ Row me to hell!--no faster? I will have thee\r\n    Chain'd unto Pluto's gallies!\r\n\r\n    _Urania._                Why to hell,\r\n    My deere Amyntas?\r\n\r\n    _Amyntas._    Why? to borrow mony!\r\n\r\n    _Amarillis._ Borrow there?\r\n\r\n    _Amy._ I, there! they say there be more Usurers there\r\n    Then all the world besides.--See how the windes\r\n    Rise! Puffe, puffe Boreas.--What a cloud comes yonder!\r\n    Take heed of that wave, Charon! ha? give mee\r\n    The oares!--So, so: the boat is overthrown;\r\n    Now Charons drown'd, but I will swim to shore....\r\n    My armes are weary;--now I sinke, I sinke!\r\n    Farewell Urania ... Styx, I thank thee! That curld wave\r\n    Hath tos'd mee on the shore.--Come Sysiphus,\r\n    I'll rowle thy stone a while: mee thinkes this labour\r\n    Doth looke like Love! does it not so, Tysiphone?\r\n\r\n    _Ama._ Mine is that restlesse toile.\r\n\r\n    _Amy._                               Is't so, Erynnis?\r\n    You are an idle huswife, goe and spin\r\n    At poore Ixions wheele!\r\n\r\n    _Ura._             Amyntas!\r\n\r\n    _Amy._                      Ha?\r\n    Am I known here?\r\n\r\n    _Ura._       Amyntas, deere Amyntas--\r\n\r\n    _Amy._ Who calls Amyntas? beauteous Proserpine?\r\n    'Tis shee.--Fair Empresse of th' Elysian shades,\r\n    Ceres bright daughter intercede for mee,\r\n    To thy incensed mother: prithee bid her\r\n    Leave talking riddles, wilt thou?... Queene of darknesse,\r\n    Thou supreme Lady of eternall night,\r\n    Grant my petitions! wilt thou beg of Ceres\r\n    That I may have Urania?\r\n\r\n    _Ura._             Tis my praier,\r\n    And shall be ever, I will promise thee\r\n    Shee shall have none but him.\r\n\r\n    _Amy._                   Thankes Proserpine!\r\n\r\n    _Ura._ Come sweet Amyntas, rest thy troubled head\r\n    Here in my lap.--Now here I hold at once\r\n    My sorrow and my comfort.--Nay, ly still.\r\n\r\n    _Amy._ I will, but Proserpine--\r\n\r\n    _Ura._                          Nay, good Amyntas--\r\n\r\n    _Amy._ Should Pluto chance to spy me, would not hee\r\n    Be jealous of me?\r\n\r\n    _Ura._        No.\r\n\r\n    _Amy._            Tysiphone,\r\n    Tell not Urania of it, least she feare\r\n    I am in love with Proserpine: doe not Fury!\r\n\r\n    _Ama._ I will not.\r\n\r\n    _Ura._             Pray ly still!\r\n\r\n    _Amy._                            You Proserpine,\r\n    There is in Sicilie the fairest Virgin\r\n    That ever blest the land, that ever breath'd\r\n    Sweeter than Zephyrus! didst thou never heare\r\n    Of one Urania?\r\n\r\n    _Ura._    Yes.\r\n\r\n    _Amy._         This poore Urania\r\n    Loves an unfortunate sheapheard, one that's mad, Tysiphone,\r\n    Canst thou believe it? Elegant Urania--\r\n    I cannot speak it without tears--still loves\r\n    Amyntas, the distracted mad Amyntas.\r\n    Is't not a constant Nymph?--But I will goe\r\n    And carry all Elysium on my back,\r\n    And that shall be her joynture.\r\n\r\n    _Ura._                     Good Amyntas,\r\n    Rest here a while!\r\n\r\n    _Amy._        Why weepe you Proserpine?\r\n\r\n    _Ura._ Because Urania weepes to see Amyntas\r\n    So restlesse and unquiet.\r\n\r\n    _Amy._               Does shee so?\r\n    Then will I ly as calme as doth the sea,\r\n    When all the winds are lock'd in Aeolus jayle;\r\n    I will not move a haire, not let a nerve\r\n    Or Pulse to beat, least I disturbe her! Hush,--\r\n    Shee sleepes!\r\n\r\n    _Ura._   And so doe you.\r\n\r\n    _Amy._                   You talk too loud,\r\n    You'l waken my Urania.\r\n\r\n    _Ura._            If Amyntas,\r\n    Her deere Amyntas would but take his rest,\r\n    Urania could not want it.\r\n\r\n    _Amy._               Not so loud! (II. iv.)\r\n\r\nIt was no ordinary imagination that conceived this example of the\r\ngrotesque in the service of the pathetic.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured in the above account to do a somewhat tardy justice to\r\nthe considerable and rather remarkably sustained qualities of Randolph's\r\nplay. I do not claim that as poetry it can be compared with the work of\r\nTasso, Fletcher, or Jonson, or that it even rivals that of Guarini or\r\nDaniel, though had Randolph lived he might easily have surpassed the\r\nlatter. But I do claim that the _Amyntas_ is one of the most interesting\r\nand important of the experiments which English writers made in the\r\npastoral drama, that it possesses dramatic qualities to which few of its\r\nkind can pretend, and that pervading and transforming the whole is the\r\ngenial humour and the sparkling wit of its brilliant and short-lived\r\nauthor. His pastoral muse was a hearty buxom lass, and kind withal, not\r\noverburdened with modesty, yet wholesome and cleanly, and if at times her\r\nlaugh rings out where the subject passes the natural enjoyment of kind, it\r\nis even then careless and merry, and there is often a ground of real fun\r\nin the jest. Her finest qualities are a sharp and ready wit and a wealth\r\nof imaginative pathos, alike pervaded by her bubbling humour; on the other\r\nhand there are moments, if rare, when in an ill-considered attempt to\r\nassume the buskin tread she reveals in her paste-board fustian somewhat of\r\nthe unregeneracy of the plebian trull. The time may yet come when\r\nRandolph's reputation, based upon his other works--the _Jealous Lovers_, a\r\nPlautine comedy, clever, but preposterous in more ways than one, the\r\n_Muses' Looking Glass_, a perfectly undramatic morality of humours, and\r\nthe poems, generally witty, occasionally graceful, and more than\r\noccasionally improper--will be enhanced by the recognition of the fact\r\nthat he came nearer than any other writer to reconciling a kind of\r\npastoral with the temper of the English stage. It was at least in part due\r\nto a constitutional indifference on the part of the London public to the\r\nloves and sorrows of imaginary swains and nymphs, that Randolph's play\r\nfailed to leave any appreciable mark upon our dramatic literature.[282]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Jonson's _Sad Shepherd_ we find ourselves once again considering a work\r\nwhich is not only one of very great interest in the history of pastoral,\r\nbut which at the same time raises important questions of literary\r\ncriticism. So far the most interesting compositions we have had to\r\nconsider--Daniel's _Hymen's Triumph_, Fletcher's _Faithful Shepherdess_,\r\nRandolph's _Amyntas_--have been attempts either to transplant the Italian\r\npastoral as it stood, or else so to modify and adapt as to fit it to the\r\nvery different conditions of the English stage. Jonson, on the other hand,\r\naimed at nothing less than the creation of an English pastoral drama.\r\nExcept for such comparatively unimportant works as _Gallathea_ and the\r\n_Converted Robber_,[283] the spectators found themselves, for the first\r\ntime, on English soil. In spite of the occasional reminiscences of\r\nTheocritus and the Arcadian erudition concerning the 'Lovers Scriptures,'\r\nthe nature of the characters is largely English. The names are not those\r\nof pastoral tradition, but rather of the popular romance, Aeglamour,\r\nLionel, Clarion, Mellifleur, Amie, or more homely, yet without Spenser's\r\nrusticity, Alken; while the one name of learned origin is a coining of\r\nJonson's own, Earine, the spirit of the spring. The silvan element, which\r\nhad been variously present since Tasso styled his play _favola\r\nboschereccia_, was used by Jonson to admirable purpose in the introduction\r\nof Robin Hood and his crew. A new departure was made in the conjoining of\r\nthe rustic and burlesque elements with the supernatural, in the persons of\r\nthe witch Maudlin, her familiar Puck-hairy, her son the rude swineherd\r\nLorel, and her daughter Douce the proud. In every case Jonson appropriated\r\nand adapted an already familiar element, but he did so in a manner to\r\nfashion out of the thumbed conventions of a hackneyed tradition something\r\nfresh and original and new.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the play is but half finished, or, at any rate, but half is\r\nat present extant. The fragment, as we have it, was first published, some\r\nyears after the author's death, in the second volume of the folio of\r\n1640, and the questions as to whether it was ever finished and to what\r\ndate the composition should be assigned are too intricate to be entered\r\nupon here. Suffice it to say that no conclusive arguments exist for\r\nsupposing that more of the play ever existed than what we now possess, nor\r\nthat what exists was written very long before the author's death. It is\r\nconceivable that the play may contain embedded in it fragments of earlier\r\npastoral work, but the attempt to identify it with the lost _May Lord_ has\r\nlittle to recommend it.[284] Seeing that the play is far from being as\r\ngenerally familiar as its poetic merit deserves, I may be allowed to give\r\na more or less detailed analysis of it in this place.[285]\r\n\r\nAfter a prologue in which Jonson gives his views on pastoral with\r\ncharacteristic self-confidence, the Sad Shepherd, Aeglamour, appears,\r\nlamenting in a brief monologue the loss of his love Earine, who is\r\nsupposed to have been drowned in the Trent.\r\n\r\n    Here she was wont to goe! and here! and here!\r\n    Just where those Daisies, Pincks, and Violets grow:\r\n    The world may find the Spring by following her;\r\n    For other print her aerie steps neere left. (I. i.)\r\n\r\nHe retires at the approach of Marian and the huntsmen, who are about to\r\nfetch of the king's venison for the feast at which Robin Hood is to\r\nentertain the shepherds of the vale of Belvoir. When they have left the\r\nstage Aeglamour comes forward and resumes his lament in a strain of\r\nmelancholic madness. He is again interrupted by the approach of Robin\r\nHood, who enters at the head of the assembled shepherds and country\r\nmaidens. Robin welcomes his guests, and his praise of rustic sports calls\r\nforth from Friar Tuck the well-known diatribe against the 'sourer sort of\r\nshepherds,' in which Jonson vented his bitterness against the hypocritical\r\npretensions of the puritan reformers--a passage which yields, in biting\r\nsatire, neither to his own presentation in the _Alchemist_ nor to Quarles'\r\nscathing burlesque quoted on an earlier page. As they discourse they\r\nbecome aware of Aeglamour sitting moodily apart, unheeding them. He talks\r\nto himself like a madman.\r\n\r\n              It will be rare, rare, rare!\r\n    An exquisite revenge: but peace, no words!\r\n    Not for the fairest fleece of all the Flock:\r\n    If it be knowne afore, 'tis all worth nothing!\r\n    Ile carve it on the trees, and in the turfe,\r\n    On every greene sworth, and in every path,\r\n    Just to the Margin of the cruell Trent;\r\n    There will I knock the story in the ground,\r\n    In smooth great peble, and mosse fill it round,\r\n    Till the whole Countrey read how she was drown'd;\r\n    And with the plenty of salt teares there shed,\r\n    Quite alter the complexion of the Spring.\r\n    Or I will get some old, old Grandam thither,\r\n    Whose rigid foot but dip'd into the water,\r\n    Shall strike that sharp and suddaine cold throughout,\r\n    As it shall loose all vertue; and those Nimphs,\r\n    Those treacherous Nimphs pull'd in Earine;\r\n    Shall stand curl'd up, like Images of Ice;\r\n    And never thaw! marke, never! a sharpe Justice.\r\n    Or stay, a better! when the yeares at hottest,\r\n    And that the Dog-starre fomes, and the streame boiles,\r\n    And curles, and workes, and swells ready to sparkle;\r\n    To fling a fellow with a Fever in,\r\n    To set it all on fire, till it burne,\r\n    Blew as Scamander, 'fore the walls of Troy,\r\n    When Vulcan leap'd in to him, to consume him. (I. v.)\r\n\r\nRobin now accosts him, hoping, since his vengeance is so complete, that\r\nhe will consent to join his fellows in honouring the spring. At this his\r\ndistracted fancy breaks out afresh:\r\n\r\n    A Spring, now she is dead: of what, of thornes?\r\n    Briars, and Brambles? Thistles? Burs, and Docks?\r\n    Cold Hemlock? Yewgh? the Mandrake, or the Boxe?\r\n    These may grow still; but what can spring betide?\r\n    Did not the whole Earth sicken, when she died?\r\n    As if there since did fall one drop of dew,\r\n    But what was wept for her! or any stalke\r\n    Did beare a Flower! or any branch a bloome,\r\n    After her wreath was made. In faith, in faith,\r\n    You doe not faire, to put these things upon me,\r\n    Which can in no sort be: Earine,\r\n    Who had her very being, and her name,\r\n    With the first knots, or buddings of the Spring,\r\n    Borne with the Primrose, and the Violet,\r\n    Or earliest Roses blowne: when Cupid smil'd,\r\n    And Venus led the Graces out to dance,\r\n    And all the Flowers, and Sweets in Natures lap,\r\n    Leap'd out, and made their solemne Conjuration,\r\n    To last, but while shee liv'd. Doe not I know,\r\n    How the Vale wither'd the same Day?... that since,\r\n    No Sun, or Moone, or other cheerfull Starre\r\n    Look'd out of heaven! but all the Cope was darke,\r\n    As it were hung so for her Exequies!\r\n    And not a voice or sound, to ring her knell,\r\n    But of that dismall paire, the scritching Owle,\r\n    And buzzing Hornet! harke, harke, harke, the foule\r\n    Bird! how shee flutters with her wicker wings!\r\n    Peace, you shall heare her scritch. (ib.)\r\n\r\nTo distract him Karoline sings a song. But after all he is but mad\r\nnorth-north-west, and though he would study the singer's conceits 'as a\r\nnew philosophy,' he also thinks to pay the singer.\r\n\r\n    Some of these Nimphs here will reward you; this,\r\n    This pretty Maid, although but with a kisse;\r\n                [_Forces Amie to kiss Karolin._\r\n    Liv'd my Earine, you should have twenty,\r\n    For every line here, one; I would allow 'hem\r\n    From mine owne store, the treasure I had in her:\r\n    Now I am poore as you. (ib.)\r\n\r\nThere follows a charming scene in which Marian, returning with the\r\nquarry, relates the fortunes of the chase, and proceeds, amid Robin's\r\ninterruptions, to tell how 'at his fall there hapt a chance worth mark.'\r\n\r\n    _Robin._ I! what was that, sweet Marian?     [_Kisses her._\r\n\r\n    _Marian._             You'll not heare?\r\n\r\n    _Rob._ I love these interruptions in a Story;  [_Kisses her\r\n                                                               again._\r\n    They make it sweeter.\r\n\r\n    _Mar._        You doe know, as soone\r\n    As the Assay is taken--                     [_Kisses her again._\r\n\r\n    _Rob._          On, my Marian.\r\n    I did but take the Assay. (I. vi.)\r\n\r\nTo cut the story short, while the deer was breaking up, there\r\n\r\n              sate a Raven\r\n    On a sere bough! a growne great Bird! and Hoarse!\r\n\r\ncrying for its bone with such persistence that the superstitious huntsmen\r\nswore it was none other than the witch, an opinion confirmed by\r\nScathlock's having since beheld old Maudlin in the chimney corner,\r\nbroiling the very piece that had been thrown to the raven. Marian now\r\nproposes to the shepherdesses to go and view the deer, whereupon Amie\r\ncomplains that she is not well, 'sick,' as her brother Lionel jestingly\r\nexplains, 'of the young shepherd that bekiss'd her.' They go off the\r\nstage, and the huntsmen and shepherds still argue for a while of the\r\nstrange chance, when Marian reappears, seemingly in ill-humour, insults\r\nRobin and his guests, orders Scathlock to carry the deer as a gift to\r\nMother Maudlin, and departs, leaving all in amazement. In the next act\r\nMaudlin relates to her daughter Douce how it was she who, in the guise of\r\nMarian, thus gulled Robin and his guests out of their venison and brought\r\ndiscord into their feast. Douce is clad in the dress of Earine, who, it\r\nnow appears, was not drowned, but is imprisoned by the witch in a hollow\r\ntree, and destined by her as her son Lorel's mistress. The swineherd now\r\nenters with the object of wooing the imprisoned damsel, whom he releases\r\nfrom the tree, Maudlin and Douce retiring the while to watch his success,\r\nwhich is small. Baffled, he again shuts the girl up in her natural cell,\r\nand his mother, coming forward, rates him soundly for his clownish ways,\r\nreading him a lecture for his guidance in his intercourse with women, in\r\nwhich she seems little concerned by the presence of her daughter. This\r\nlatter, so far as it is possible to judge from the few speeches assigned\r\nto her in the fragment, appears to be of a more agreeable nature than one\r\nmight, under the circumstances, have expected. Jonson sought, it would\r\nappear, to invest her with a certain pathos, presenting a character of\r\nnatural good feeling, but in which no moral instinct has ever been\r\nawakened; and it is by no means improbable that he may have intended to\r\ndissociate her from her surroundings in order to balance the numbers of\r\nhis nymphs and swains.[286] After Lorel has left them, Maudlin shows Douce\r\nthe magic girdle, by virtue of which she effects her transformations, and\r\nby which she may always be recognized through her disguises. In the next\r\nscene we find Amie suffering from the effect of Karol's kiss. She is ill\r\nat ease, she knows not why, and the innocent description of her love-pain\r\npossesses, in spite of its quaint artificiality, something of the\r\n_naïveté_ of _Daphnis and Chloe_.\r\n\r\n    How often, when the Sun, heavens brightest birth,\r\n    Hath with his burning fervour cleft the earth,\r\n    Under a spreading Elme, or Oake, hard by\r\n    A coole cleare fountaine, could I sleeping lie,\r\n    Safe from the heate? but now, no shadie tree,\r\n    Nor purling brook, can my refreshing bee?\r\n    Oft when the medowes were growne rough with frost,\r\n    The rivers ice-bound, and their currents lost,\r\n    My thick warme fleece, I wore, was my defence,\r\n    Or large good fires, I made, drave winter thence.\r\n    But now, my whole flocks fells, nor this thick grove,\r\n    Enflam'd to ashes, can my cold remove;\r\n    It is a cold and heat, that doth out-goe\r\n    All sense of Winters, and of Summers so. (II. iv.)\r\n\r\nTo the shepherdesses enters Robin, who upbraids Marian for her late\r\nconduct towards him and his guests. She of course protests ignorance of\r\nthe whole affair, bids Scathlock fetch again the venison, and remains\r\nunconvinced of Robin's being in earnest, till Maudlin herself comes to\r\nthank her for the gift. Marian endeavours to treat with the witch, and\r\nbegs her to return the venison sent through some mistake, but Maudlin\r\ndeclares that she has already departed it among her poor neighbours. At\r\nthis moment, however, Scathlock returns with the deer on his shoulders, to\r\nthe discomfiture of the witch, who curses the feast, and after tormenting\r\npoor Amie, who between sleeping and waking betrays the origin of her\r\ndisease, departs in an evil humour. The scene is noteworthy for its\r\ndelicate comedy and pathos.\r\n\r\n    _Amie_ [_asleep_]. O Karol, Karol, call him back againe ...\r\n    O', ô.\r\n\r\n    _Marian._ How is't Amie?\r\n\r\n    _Melifleur._       Wherefore start you?\r\n\r\n    _Amie._ O' Karol, he is faire, and sweet.\r\n\r\n    _Maud._             What then?\r\n    Are there not flowers as sweet, and faire, as men?\r\n    The Lillie is faire! and Rose is sweet!\r\n\r\n    _Amie._               I', so!\r\n    Let all the Roses, and the Lillies goe:\r\n    Karol is only faire to mee!\r\n\r\n    _Mar._          And why?\r\n\r\n    _Amie._ Alas, for Karol, Marian, I could die.\r\n    Karol he singeth sweetly too!\r\n\r\n    _Maud._          What then?\r\n    Are there not Birds sing sweeter farre, then Men?\r\n\r\n    _Amie._ I grant the Linet, Larke, and Bul-finch sing,\r\n    But best, the deare, good Angell of the Spring,\r\n    The Nightingale.\r\n\r\n    _Maud._      Then why? then why, alone,\r\n    Should his notes please you? ...\r\n\r\n    _Amie._ This verie morning, but--I did bestow--\r\n    It was a little 'gainst my will, I know--\r\n    A single kisse, upon the seelie Swaine,\r\n    And now I wish that verie kisse againe.\r\n    His lip is softer, sweeter then the Rose,\r\n    His mouth, and tongue with dropping honey flowes;\r\n    The relish of it was a pleasing thing.\r\n\r\n    _Maud._ Yet like the Bees it had a little sting.\r\n\r\n    _Amie._ And sunke, and sticks yet in my marrow deepe\r\n    And what doth hurt me, I now wish to keepe. (II. vi.)\r\n\r\nAfter this exhibition of her malice the shepherds and huntsmen no longer\r\ndoubt that it was Maudlin herself who deceived them in the shape of\r\nMarian, and they determine to pursue her through the forest. The wise\r\nshepherd, Alken, undertakes the direction of this novel 'blast of\r\nvenerie,' and thus discourses of her unhallowed haunts: /p Within a\r\ngloomie dimble shee doth dwell, Downe in a pitt, ore-growne with brakes\r\nand briars, Close by the ruines of a shaken Abbey Torne, with an\r\nEarth-quake, down unto the ground; 'Mongst graves, and grotts, neare an\r\nold Charnell house, Where you shall find her sitting in her fourme, As\r\nfearfull, and melancholique, as that Shee is about; with Caterpillers\r\nkells, And knottie Cobwebs, rounded in with spells. Thence shee steales\r\nforth to releif, in the foggs, And rotten Mistes, upon the fens, and\r\nboggs, Downe to the drowned Lands of Lincolneshire. .....[There] the sad\r\nMandrake growes, Whose grones are deathfull! the dead-numming Night-shade!\r\nThe stupifying Hemlock! Adders tongue! And Martagan! the shreikes of\r\nlucklesse Owles, Wee heare! and croaking Night-Crowes in the aire!\r\nGreene-bellied Snakes! blew fire-drakes in the skie! And giddie\r\nFlitter-mice, with lether wings! The scalie Beetles, with their\r\nhabergeons, That make a humming Murmur as they flie! There, in the stocks\r\nof trees, white Faies doe dwell, And span-long Elves, that dance about a\r\npoole, With each a little Changeling, in their armes! The airie spirits\r\nplay with falling starres, And mount the Sphere of fire, to kisse the\r\nMoone! While, shee sitts reading by the Glow-wormes light, Or rotten wood,\r\no're which the worme hath crept, The banefull scedule of her nocent\r\ncharmes. (II. viii.)\r\n\r\nIn the third act we are introduced to Puck-hairy, who laments his lot as\r\nthe familiar of the malignant witch in whose service he has now to 'firk\r\nit like a goblin' about the woods. Meanwhile Karol meets Douce in the\r\ndress of Earine, who, however, runs off on the approach of Aeglamour. The\r\nlatter fancies she is the ghost of his drowned love, and falls into a\r\n'superstitious commendation' of her. His delusions are conceived in a vein\r\nno less happy and more distinctly poetical than those of Amyntas.\r\n\r\n    But shee, as chaste as was her name, Earine,\r\n    Dy'd undeflowr'd: and now her sweet soule hovers,\r\n    Here, in the Aire, above us; and doth haste\r\n    To get up to the Moone, and Mercury;\r\n    And whisper Venus in her Orbe; then spring\r\n    Up to old Saturne, and come downe by Mars,\r\n    Consulting Jupiter; and seate her selfe\r\n    Just in the midst with Phoebus, tempring all\r\n    The jarring Spheeres, and giving to the World\r\n    Againe, his first and tunefull planetting!\r\n    O' what an age will here be of new concords!\r\n    Delightfull harmonie! to rock old Sages,\r\n    Twice infants, in the Cradle o' Speculation,\r\n    And throw a silence upon all the creatures!...\r\n    The loudest Seas, and most enraged Windes\r\n    Shall lose their clangor; Tempest shall grow hoarse;\r\n    Loud Thunder dumbe; and every speece of storme\r\n    Laid in the lap of listning Nature, husht,\r\n    To heare the changed chime of this eighth spheere! (III. ii.)\r\n\r\nAfter this Lionel appears in search of Karol, who is in requisition for\r\nthe distressed Amie. They are about to go off together when Maudlin again\r\nappears in the shape of Marian, with the news that Amie is recovered and\r\ntheir presence no longer required. At this moment, however, Robin appears,\r\nand suspecting the witch, who tries to escape, seizes her by the girdle\r\nand runs off the stage with her. The girdle breaks, and Robin returns with\r\nit in his hand, followed by the witch in her own shape. Robin and the\r\nshepherds go off with the prize, while Maudlin summons Puck to her aid and\r\nsets to plotting revenge. Lorel also appears for the purpose of again\r\naddressing himself to his imprisoned mistress, and, if necessary, putting\r\nhis mother's precepts into practice. With the words of the witch:\r\n\r\n              Gang thy gait, and try\r\n    Thy turnes with better luck, or hang thy sel';\r\n\r\nthe fragment breaks off abruptly. From the Argument prefixed to Act III we\r\nknow that Lorel's purpose with Earine was interrupted by the entrance of\r\nClarion and Aeglamour, and her discovery was only prevented by a sudden\r\nmist called up by Maudlin. The witch then set about the recovery of her\r\ngirdle, was tracked by the huntsmen as she wove her spells, but escaped\r\nby the help of her goblin and through the over-eagerness of her pursuers.\r\n\r\nStrangely different estimates have been formed of the merits of Jonson's\r\npastoral, alike in itself and in contrast with Fletcher's play. Gifford,\r\nwho, in spite of his vast erudition, seldom soared in his critical\r\njudgements above the more obvious and conventional considerations of\r\npropriety and style, praised the work as 'natural and elegant' in thought,\r\nand in language 'inexpressibly beautiful,' while at the same time with the\r\npetty insolence which habitually marked his utterances concerning any who\r\nstood in rivalry with his hero, he referred to the _Faithful Shepherdess_\r\nas being 'insufferably tedious' as a poem, and held that as a drama 'its\r\nheaviness can only be equalled by its want of art.' Gifford's spleen,\r\nhowever, had evidently been aroused by Weber, who had declared the _Sad\r\nShepherd_ to be written 'in emulation of Fletcher's poem, but far short of\r\nit,' and his remarks must not be taken too seriously. Two quotations will\r\nserve to illustrate the diversity of opinion among modern critics. They\r\ndisplay alike more condescension to particulars and greater weight of\r\njudgement. Thus we find Mr. Swinburne, in his very able study of Ben\r\nJonson, not a little disgusted at the introduction of the broader humour\r\nand burlesque of the dialect-speaking characters, Maudlin, Lorel,\r\nScathlock, in conjunction with the greater refinement of Robin, Marian,\r\nand the shepherds. 'A masque including an antimasque, in which the serious\r\npart is relieved and set off by the introduction of parody or burlesque,\r\nwas a form of art or artificial fashion in which incongruity was a merit;\r\nthe grosser the burlesque, the broader the parody, the greater was the\r\nsuccess and the more effective was the result: but in a dramatic attempt\r\nof higher pretention than such as might be looked for in the literary\r\ngroundwork or raw material for a pageant, this intrusion of incongruous\r\ncontrast is a pure barbarism--a positive solecism in composition.... On\r\nthe other hand, even Gifford's editorial enthusiasm could not overestimate\r\nthe ingenious excellence of construction, the masterly harmony of\r\ncomposition, which every reader of the argument must have observed with\r\nsuch admiration as can but intensify his regret that scarcely half of the\r\nprojected poem has come down to us. No work of Ben Jonson's is more\r\namusing and agreeable to read, as none is more graceful in expression or\r\nmore excellent in simplicity of style.' This last is high meed of praise,\r\nbut it is the question raised in the earlier portion of the criticism that\r\nnow particularly concerns us. His love of strong contrasts has no doubt\r\ninfluenced Mr. Swinburne to express at any rate not less than he felt, but\r\nhe has raised a perfectly clear and evident issue, and one which it is\r\nimpossible for the critic to neglect. Although had the play undergone\r\nfinal revision, it is possible that Jonson, whose literary judgement was\r\nof no mean order, would have softened some of the harsher contrasts in his\r\nwork, it is evident that they were in the main intentional and\r\ndeliberately calculated. This appears alike from the prologue, in which he\r\ndenounces the heresy\r\n\r\n    That mirth by no meanes fits a Pastorall,\r\n\r\nas also from what we gather concerning an earlier work, in which he\r\nintroduced 'clownes making mirth and foolish sports,' as recorded by\r\nDrummond. As against Mr. Swinburne's view may be set that of Dr. Ward. 'In\r\n_The Sad Shepherd_ [Jonson] has with singular freshness caught the spirit\r\nof the greenwood. If this pastoral is more realistic in texture than\r\neither Spenser's or Milton's efforts in the same direction, the result is\r\ndue, partly to the character of the writer, partly to the circumstance\r\nthat Jonson's \"shepherds\" are beings of a definite age and country. It\r\nmust, however, be observed that the personages in this pastoral are in\r\npart not shepherds at all, but Robin Hood and his merry men. We may admit\r\nthat the lucky combination thus hit upon could probably not easily be\r\nrepeated; but this is merely to acknowledge the felicity of the author's\r\ninvention.' Allowing for the difference of temper in the two writers, it\r\nwill be seen that the view taken of certain essentials of the piece is as\r\nfavourable in the one case as it is unfavourable in the other. Both alike\r\nare critics of recognized standing, so that whichever position one may\r\nfeel disposed to adopt, ample authority may be quoted in support. There\r\nare unfortunate occasions on which one's favourite oracle perversely\r\nrefuses to accommodate himself to one's own view. Mr. Swinburne is a\r\nwriter from whom on points of aesthetic judgement I for one differ, but\r\nwith the greatest reluctance. Nevertheless in the present case I feel\r\nbound to record my dissent.\r\n\r\nJonson's play was, as I have already said, an attempt to create a new and\r\ngenuinely English form of pastoral drama. How far did he succeed? Mr.\r\nHomer Smith charitably hints that it was owing to the 'exquisite poetry'\r\nin which Jonson's design was clothed 'that many critics do not perceive\r\nthat he failed in the task he set himself.' This is, however, but to\r\nrepeat in cruder form Mr. Swinburne's contention.[287] That Jonson did not\r\nfail in the task he set himself it would be difficult to maintain--only,\r\nhowever, I believe, because he faiîed to carry it to completion. Had he\r\nlived to finish the remaining portion of the play in a manner consonant\r\nwith that which he has left us, there would probably have been no question\r\nas to the propriety of the means he used. I am fully aware how difficult\r\nand often dangerous it is in these matters to argue from a mere fragment,\r\nespecially in view of the breakdown of so many plays when they come to the\r\nunravelling, but it should be borne in mind that in the matter of dramatic\r\nconstruction Jonson stood head and shoulders above all the other writers\r\nwith whom we have been concerned, Fletcher not excepted.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, proceeding to discuss the issue raised by Mr. Swinburne,\r\nit will be well to clear up certain minor misapprehensions. In the first\r\nplace Mr. Homer Smith states that Jonson 'wove together the two threads,\r\npastoral and forest, apparently regarding them of equal importance and\r\nseeing no incongruity in the combination.' In so far as this may be taken\r\nto imply a necessary incompatibility of the traditions of field and\r\nforest, it is of course utterly opposed to the whole history of pastoral\r\ntradition. Tasso's Silvia and Guarini's Silvio alike are silvan not in\r\nname only, but are truly figures of the woods, hunters of the wolf and\r\nboar; while the same distinction survives in a modified form in Daniel's\r\n_Hymen's Triumph_, in which the ruder characters, Montanus and the rest,\r\nare described as foresters. The contrast appears sharply in the _Maid's\r\nMetamorphosis_ in the characters of Silvio and Gemulo; more faintly\r\nindicated by Randolph in Laurinda's lovers, of whom one frequents the\r\nwoods and one the plains. The pastoral and forest traditions are in their\r\nessence and history indistinguishable.[288] Probably, however, what the\r\nwriter had in view was some supposed incongruity between the characters of\r\npopular romance, such as Robin and his crew, and the shepherds whom he\r\nregards as pure Arcadians. This is the same objection as that raised by\r\nMr. Swinburne, to which I shall return.\r\n\r\nAnother point which has been somewhat obscured by previous writers is the\r\ncomparative importance of the two threads. Thus, again to quote Mr. Homer\r\nSmith, it has been held that 'In general the pastoral incidents serve as\r\nan underplot, utterly foreign in spirit to the main plot.' Against this\r\nview that the pastoral is, intentionally at least, the subsidiary element,\r\nthe title itself is a strong argument--'The Sad Shepherd: A Tale of Robin\r\nHood.' Clearly the first title would naturally indicate the main subject\r\nof the plot, and the vague addition suggest, the surroundings amid which\r\nthe action is laid. This is a consideration which no amount of\r\nstichometrical argument can seriously discount, especially in the case of\r\na fragment. The same view is borne out by the plot itself so far as it is\r\nknown to us. In Aeglamour's despair at the supposed loss of his love we\r\nhave a situation already familiar from at least two English pastorals,\r\n_Hymen's Triumph_ and Rutter's _Shepherds' Holiday_; while in the\r\ndetention of Earine in the power of the witch we have the material for an\r\nexciting and touching development. Where else can we look for the elements\r\nof a plot? The only possible alternative lies in the dissensions sown by\r\nMaudlin between Robin and his love Maid Marian. Here indeed we find the\r\nmaterials for some excellent comedy, and the instinctive sympathy excited\r\nby the characters in the breast of every Englishman, as well as the\r\nexquisite charm and grace imparted to the forest scenes by Jonson's verse,\r\nhave undoubtedly combined to obscure the real action in the earlier part\r\nof the fragment. But since Lord Fitzwater's daughter is doomed by an\r\nunkind tradition to remain Maid Marian still, no fortunate solution of the\r\n_imbroglio_ can do more than restore the harmony which had been before,\r\nand the plot would therefore be open to the precise objection from the\r\ndramatic point of view which we found in the case of the _Faithful\r\nShepherdess_. Moreover, the complication is completely solved by the end\r\nof the second act, and it was obviously introduced for no other purpose\r\nthan to bring about a general crusade against the wise woman and her\r\nconfederate powers, which should be the means of restoring Earine to her\r\nSad Shepherd. Thus the story of these lovers alone can supply the\r\nmaterials for the main, or indeed for any real plot at all; and the fact\r\nthat, as Mr. Homer Smith informs us, out of some thousand lines less than\r\nhalf are devoted to strictly pastoral interests, is but evidence of the\r\nfelicity of construction, by which Jonson, while keeping the pastoral plot\r\nas the mainspring of the piece, nevertheless avoided the tediousness\r\nalmost inseparable from pastoral action and atmosphere, and threw the\r\nburden of stage business upon the more congenial personages of Maid\r\nMarian, Robin Hood and his merry men, the Witch of Paplewich, and Robin\r\nGoodfellow. It remains for us to consider the fundamental question which\r\narises in connexion with Mr. Swinburne's criticism. Are the various\r\nthreads of which Jonson wove his plot in themselves incompatible and\r\nincongruous? Is it correct to describe the parts played by the more rustic\r\ncharacters as a grotesque antimasque to the action of the polished\r\nshepherds? Or is Dr. Ward right in considering the combination a happy\r\none, and the characters harmonious? Now any one who wishes to defend Mr.\r\nSwinburne's view must do so on one of two ground: either he must maintain\r\nthe general proposition that various degrees of idealization are\r\nessentially incompatible within the limits of a single artistic\r\ncomposition, or else he must hold that the contrast between the two sets\r\nof characters in the actual play is itself of a grossness to offend the\r\nsense of literary propriety in an audience. If any one is prepared without\r\nqualification to maintain the former of these two propositions, he is\r\nwelcome to do so, and he will be perfectly entitled to condemn Jonson's\r\npastoral on the strength of it; but I doubt whether this was the intention\r\nof the critic himself. Although as a general rule the English drama found\r\nits romance rather in what it imagined to be realism than in conscious\r\nidealization, yet the contrast between the imaginative and refined\r\ncreations of the fancy and the often coarse and gross transcripts from\r\ncommon life are too frequent even to require specific mention, and many\r\nshades even of imaginative painting, many degrees of idealism, may\r\nfrequently be met with in the course of a single play. What of Rosalind,\r\nPhoebe, and Audrey in _As You Like It_? But that is a question to which we\r\nshall have to return. It will, however, be contended that in the _Sad\r\nShepherd_ we are introduced to a wholly idealized and artificially refined\r\natmosphere surrounding the shepherds and their hosts, which is yet\r\nconstantly liable to be broken in upon by beings of the outer world, rude\r\nunchastened mortals compounded of our common clay, whose entrance dispels\r\nat a stroke the delicate, refined atmosphere of pastoral convention. This\r\nbrings us to the second alternative mentioned above, to meet which we\r\nshall have to condescend to particulars, and consider the real natures of\r\nthe various groups of personages with which Jonson crowds his stage.\r\n\r\nThe question of the incongruity of the various characters in Jonson's\r\npastoral is one which every reader of taste must decide for himself. All\r\nthat the critic can hope to do is to point out how the figures on the\r\nstage compare with previous tradition and convention on the one hand, and\r\nwith the characters of actual life on the other. But in doing this I hope\r\nto be able to vindicate Jonson's taste, for I believe Mr. Swinburne to be\r\nin error in regarding the shepherds of the play as more, and the rustic\r\ncharacters as less, idealized than Jonson intended them, and than they in\r\nreality are. Were the shepherds the pure Arcadians Mr. Homer Smith asserts\r\nthem to be, and were it necessary with Mr. Swinburne to regard Scathlock\r\nand Maudlin as mere parody and burlesque, then indeed Jonson's taste, as\r\nexhibited in the _Sad Shepherd_, would not be worth defending. But it is\r\nnot so.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary in the first place, however, to make certain admissions.\r\nIt is true that in the fragment as we possess it there are certain\r\npassages which pass beyond any legitimate idealization of the actual world\r\nin which Jonson chose to lay his scene, and which contrast jarringly and\r\nirreconcilably with the coarser threads of homespun. Thus Aeglamour, in so\r\nfar as it is possible to form an opinion, keeps too much of the artificial\r\nArcadianism of the Italians about him, and is hardly of a piece with the\r\nrest of the personae. The same may be said of the name at least of Earine;\r\nof her character it is impossible to judge--in one passage indeed we find\r\nher talking broad dialect, but that doubtless only through an oversight of\r\nthe author. Much the same may be censured of individual passages: the\r\nsingularly out-of-place catalogue of 'Lovers Scriptures' put into the\r\nmouth of Clarion, and, in a speech of Aeglamour's, the collocation of Dean\r\nand Erwash, Idle, Snite, and Soar, with the nymphs and Graces that come\r\ndancing out of the fourth ode of Horace. Some have been inclined to add an\r\noccasional reminiscence of Sappho or so; but critics appear somewhat dense\r\nat understanding that when Amie, for instance, speaks of 'the dear good\r\nangel of the spring,' it is not she but her creator who is exhibiting a\r\nfamiliarity with the classics. In this and similar cases the fact of\r\nborrowing in no wise affects the question of dramatic propriety. Certain\r\nincongruities must then be admitted, but they lie rather in casual\r\npassages than in any necessary portion of the play; while in so far as\r\nthey appear in the presentation of any character, the contrast seems to\r\nlie rather between Aeglamour and the rest of the shepherds than between\r\nthese and the less polished huntsmen. It should furthermore be\r\nremembered--though the remark is perhaps strictly beside, or rather\r\nbeyond, the point--that where the incongruous elements are not\r\nfundamental, it is always possible that they might have been removed had\r\nthe play undergone revision.\r\n\r\nSubject to these reservations it appears to me that the characters and\r\ngeneral tone of Jonson's pastoral are perfectly harmonious and congruent.\r\nThe shepherds are far removed from the types of Arcadian convention, and\r\nmay more properly be regarded as idealizations from the actual country\r\nlads and lasses of merry England. Their names are borrowed from popular\r\nromance, which, if somewhat French in its tone, was certainly in no way\r\nantagonistic to the legends of Sherwood nor to the agency of witchcraft\r\nand fairy lore[289]. Even Alken, in spite of his didactic bent, is as far\r\nas possible from being the conventional 'wise shepherd,' and certainly no\r\nArcadian ever displayed such knowledge as he of the noble art, while his\r\nlecture on the blast of hag-hunting, though savouring somewhat of\r\nburlesque, contains perhaps the most thoroughly charming and romantic\r\nlines that ever flowed from the pen of the great exponent of classical\r\ntradition. That the characters owe nothing to Arcadian tradition is not\r\ncontended, nor do I know that it would be desirable that they should not,\r\nsince that tradition forms at least a convenient, if not an altogether\r\nnecessary, precedent for such pastoral idealization; but even if it is\r\ngoing rather far to say that they 'belong to a definite age and country,'\r\nthey have yet sufficient individuality and community of human nature to be\r\nwholly fitting companions for the gallant Robin and his fair lady. Jonson,\r\nit would appear, consciously adopted the pastoral method, if hardly the\r\npastoral mood, of Theocritus, in contradistinction to that of the courtly\r\npoets in Italy. It will be noticed that he has not forborne to introduce\r\nreferences to sheepcraft, but the fact that these enter more or less\r\nnaturally into the discourse, and are not, as in Fletcher's pastoral,\r\nintroduced in the vain hope of giving local colour to wholly uncolourable\r\ncharacters, saves them from having the same stilted effect, and is at the\r\nsame time evidence of the greater reality of Jonson's personae. It is also\r\nnoteworthy that Jonson has even ventured upon allegorical matter in one\r\npassage at least, but has succeeded in doing so in a manner in no wise\r\nincongruous with the nature of actual rustics, though the collocation of\r\nRobin Hood and the rise of Puritanism must be admitted to be historically\r\nsomething of an anachronism.\r\n\r\nRobin and Maid Marian are, of course, characters no whit less idealized\r\nthan the shepherds, though the process was largely effected by popular\r\ntradition instead of by the author. But this being so, such characters as\r\nMuch and Scathlock must be no less incongruous with Robin and Marian than\r\nwith Karol and Amie--a proportion which those who love the old Sherwood\r\ntradition would be loath to admit. In any case the incongruity, if it\r\nexists, is not of Jonson's devising, but consecrated for ages in the\r\npopular mind. The truth is, however, that Much and Little John, Scathlock\r\nand Scarlet are, in spite of their more homely speech and humour, scarcely\r\nless idealized than any of the other characters I have mentioned. That\r\nJonson has even sought to tone down such harshness of contrast as he found\r\nis noticeable in his treatment of a recognized figure of burlesque like\r\nFriar Tuck, who is throughout portrayed with decorum and respect.\r\n\r\nLastly, to come to the third group of characters. If it was impossible for\r\nan English audience to regard as burlesque such popular and sympathetic\r\ncharacters as Robin and his merry men, so a malignant witch and a\r\nmischievous elf were far too serious agents of ill to be treated in this\r\nlight either. Characters whose unholy powers would have fitted them for\r\ndeath at the stake can scarcely have been regarded even by the rude\r\naudiences of pre-restoration London as fitting subjects of farce, while\r\nthere is nothing to lead us to suppose that Jonson, whatever his private\r\nopinion on the subject may have been, sought in the present instance to\r\ncast ridicule upon the belief in witches, but rather it is evident that he\r\nlaid hands upon everything that could give colour to their sinister\r\nreputation. On the other hand, he has treated the whole subject with an\r\nimaginative touch which relieves us of all tragic or moral apprehension,\r\nremoves all the squalid and unblessed surroundings into the region of\r\nromantic art, and makes it impossible to regard the characters as less\r\nidealized than those of the shepherds and huntsmen. I cannot myself but\r\nregard the elements of witchcraft and fairy employed by Jonson as far more\r\nin harmony not only with Robin Hood and his men, but also with the\r\nshepherds of Belvoir vale, than would have been the oracles, satyrs, and\r\nother outworn machinery of regular pastoral tradition.\r\n\r\nThere remains the rusticity of language which distinguishes some of the\r\nruder characters from others more refined. That some contrast between the\r\ngroups was intended is indisputable, that the contrast is rather harsher\r\nthan the author intended may be plausibly maintained. There is, on the\r\nwhole, a lack of graduation. Into the question of dialectism in general it\r\nis needless to enter. The speech employed would be inoffensive, were it\r\nnot that it is, and is felt to be, no genuine dialect at all, but a mere\r\nliterary convention, a mixture of broad Yorkshire and Lothian Scots, not\r\nonly utterly out of place in Sherwood forest, but such as can never have\r\nbeen spoken by any sane rustic. Still more than of Spenser is Ben's dictum\r\ntrue of himself, that where he departed from the cultivated English of his\r\nday, whether in imitation of the ancients or of provincial dialect matters\r\nnot, he failed to write any language at all. Yet here, if anywhere, we\r\nshould be justified in arguing that it is unfair to judge an unrevised\r\nfragment as if it were a completed work in the form in which the author\r\ndecided to give it to the world. Jonson, as his _English Grammar_ shows,\r\nwas not without a knowledge of the antiquities at least of our tongue, and\r\nit is reasonable to suppose that, had he lived to publish his pastoral\r\nhimself, he would have removed some of the more glaring enormities of\r\nlanguage, along with certain other improprieties which could hardly have\r\nescaped his critical eye.\r\n\r\nJonson then, as it seems to me, setting aside a few points of minor\r\nimportance, successfully combined what he found suited to his purpose in\r\nprevious pastoral tradition, with what was most romantic and attractive in\r\npopular legend and a genuine idealization from actual types, to produce a\r\nveritable English pastoral, which failed of success only in that it\r\nremained unfinished at the death of its author.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1783 F. G. Waldron published his continuation of Jonson's fragment.\r\nThis work, while betraying throughout the date of its composition, and\r\nfalling in every respect short of the original, yet catches some measure\r\nof its glamour and charm, and has received deserved, if somewhat\r\nqualified, praise at the hands of Jonson's critics. The chief faults of\r\nthe piece are the writer's anxiety to marry every good character and\r\nconvert every bad one, and the manner in which the dramatic climax by\r\nwhich Aeglamour and Earine should be brought together is frittered away.\r\nThe shepherdess is duly released from the hands of the lewd Lorel, but\r\nonly to find that her lover has drowned himself. The hermit is, of course,\r\nintroduced to revive the Sad Shepherd and restore his wits, and so all\r\nends happily. The only original passage of any particular merit is the\r\nhunter's dirge over the drowned Aeglamour, which is perhaps worth\r\nquoting[290]:\r\n\r\n    The chase is o'er, the hart is slain!\r\n    The gentlest hart that grac'd the plain;\r\n    With breath of bugles sound his knell,\r\n    Then lay him low in Death's drear dell!\r\n\r\n    Nor beauteous form, nor dappled hide,\r\n    Nor branchy head will long abide;\r\n    Nor fleetest foot that scuds the heath,\r\n    Can 'scape the fleeter huntsman, Death.\r\n\r\n    The hart is slain! his faithful deer,\r\n    In spite of hounds or huntsman near,\r\n    Despising Death, and all his train,\r\n    Laments her hart untimely slain!\r\n\r\n    The chase is o'er, the hart is slain!\r\n    The gentlest hart that grac'd the plain;\r\n    Blow soft your bugles, sound his knell,\r\n    Then lay him low in Death's drear dell!\r\n\r\n    (Act IV.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI.\r\n\r\nThe English Pastoral Drama\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen in an earlier chapter what had been achieved within the\r\nlimits of the mythological drama proper, and also how it had fared with\r\nthe attempts to introduce the Italian pastoral into England either by way\r\nof translation or of direct imitation. We have also seen how, in three\r\nnotable compositions, three different and variously gifted artists had\r\nendeavoured to produce a form of pastoral drama suited to the requirements\r\nof the English stage, and how they had each in turn fallen short of\r\ncomplete success. We have now to consider a series of plays, less\r\ndistinguished on the whole, though varying greatly in individual merit,\r\nwhich, amid the luxuriant growth of the romantic drama, tended, in a more\r\nspontaneous and less purposeful manner, towards the creation of something\r\nof a pastoral tradition. We shall find in thèse plays a considerable\r\ntraditional influence, a groundwork, as it were, borrowed from the\r\nArcadian drama of Italy, together with frequent elements owing their\r\norigin to plays of the mythological type. But in the great majority of\r\ncases we shall also find another influence, which will serve to\r\ndifferentiate these plays from those we have been hitherto concerned with.\r\nThis is the influence of the so-called pastoral romances of the Spanish\r\ntype, which manifests itself in the introduction of characters and\r\nincidents, warlike, courtly, or adventurous, borrowed more or less\r\ndirectly from the works of writers such as Sidney, Greene, and Lodge.\r\nTheir influence was extended and enduring, and survived until, towards the\r\nmiddle of the seventeenth century, the fashionable tradition of the\r\n_Astrée_ was introduced from France[291]. It was evinced both in a general\r\nmanner and likewise in direct dramatic adaptation. Since the romances\r\nthus dramatized lay claim to a pastoral character, it will be necessary\r\nfor us to examine as briefly as may be these stage versions, however\r\nlittle of the pastoral element may survive, as a preliminary to\r\nconsidering other plays in which the debt is less specific.\r\n\r\nThere are extant at least seven plays founded upon Sidney's\r\n_Arcadia_.[292] Since these appear to be wholly independent of one\r\nanother, it will be convenient to disregard chronology, and to consider\r\nfirst those which have for subject the main story of the romance, four in\r\nnumber, and then the remaining three founded upon various incidents.\r\nFirst, then, and most important, Shirley's play bearing the same title as\r\nthe romance will claim our attention as the most full and faithful\r\nstage-rendering of Sidney's work. Although not printed till 1640 the play\r\nwas, according to Mr. Fleay's plausible conjecture, performed on the\r\nking's birthdayas early as 1632. It cannot exactly be pronounced a good\r\nplay, but the dramatization is effected in a manner which does justice to\r\nthe very great abilities of the author, and the same measure of success\r\nwould probably not have been attained by any other dramatist of the time.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the play we find that Basilius, king of Arcadia, has, in\r\nconsequence of a threatening oracle, committed the government of his\r\nkingdom into the hands of a nobleman Philanax, and retired into a rural\r\n'desert' along with his wife Gynecia and his daughters Philoclea and\r\nPamela. Here they live in company with the 'most arrant dotish clowne'\r\nDametas, his wife Miso and daughter Mopsa, rustic characters which supply\r\na coarsely farcical element in the plot, certainly no less out of place\r\nand inharmonious in the play than in the romance. There are also the\r\ncousins Pyrocles and Musidorus, son and nephew respectively to Euarchus,\r\nking of Thessaly, who have arrived in quest of the princesses' loves, and\r\nhave obtained positions near the objects of their affection, the one\r\ndisguised as an Amazon under the name of Zelmane, the other seeking\r\nservice under Dametas and assuming the name of Dorus. Complications,\r\nmoreover, have already arisen, Basilius falling in love with the supposed\r\nAmazon, while Gynecia sees through the disguise and falls in love with the\r\nconcealed Pyrocles. The disguised lover, in order to allay suspicion, has\r\nto feign a return of love to the queen and also to humour the dotage of\r\nthe king, in the meanwhile revealing himself and his love to Philoclea,\r\nwhom her father employs to court the affections of the Amazon. Musidorus,\r\non his part, while pretending to court Mopsa, takes the opportunity of\r\naddressing his suit to Pamela. At length all is arranged, the princesses\r\nconsenting to accompany their lovers in flight, and the various guardians\r\nbeing cleverly duped. Pyrocles gives rendezvous both to Basilius and\r\nGynecia in a dark and lonely cave, Dametas is sent to dig for hidden\r\ntreasure, Miso to seek her maligned husband in the house of one of her\r\nfemale neighbours, and Mopsa to await the coming of Apollo in the\r\nwishing-tree. Musidorus and Pamela make for the coast, while Pyrocles goes\r\nto fetch his mistress Philoclea. While, however, he is endeavouring to\r\npersuade her to take the final and irrevocable step, they are both\r\novercome by a strange drowsiness and are discovered by Dametas, who,\r\ndisappointed of his treasure, has missed his charge Pamela and comes to\r\ngive the alarm. Musidorus and his mistress on their side have been\r\ncaptured by outlaws, who, discovering their identity, bring them back,\r\nhoping thereby to secure their own pardons. In the meantime, in the cave\r\nGynecia has given Basilius by mistake for Zelmane a love potion, which\r\nturns out apparently to be a strong narcotic, for the king at once falls\r\ninto a death-like trance, and the queen, discovering her mistake and\r\novercome by shame and remorse, accuses herself publicly of having poisoned\r\nher husband, and is consequently put under guard. At this juncture\r\nEuarchus happens to arrive in search of his son and nephew, and consents\r\nto act as judge in the case. The princes, who for no apparent reason\r\nassume false names, are brought up for judgement and sentenced to death by\r\nEuarchus, whom, unaccountably enough, they fail to recognize. They are\r\nabout to be led off to execution when Basilius, who is lying on a bier in\r\nthe judgement hall, suddenly rises, the potion having spent its force.\r\nExplanations and recognitions of course follow, the oracle is\r\nsatisfactorily expounded, and all ends to the sound of marriage bells.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that in spite of the description 'pastoral' which appears\r\non the title-page of the play, there is little or nothing of this nature\r\nto be found in the plot, and in this it is typical of all the plays\r\nfounded upon Sidney's romance. The only pastoral element indeed is a sort\r\nof show or masque, presented by the rustic characters in company with\r\ncertain shepherds, and even here little of a pastoral nature is visible\r\nbeyond the characters of the performers. As a play, the _Arcadia_ is\r\ndistinctly pleasing; the action is bright and easy, the gulling scenes are\r\nvery entertaining, and some of the love scenes, notably that in which\r\nPyrocles endeavours to persuade Philoclea to escape with him, are\r\ncharmingly written. Take for instance the following passage, in which the\r\nprincess confesses her love:[293]\r\n\r\n                            such a truth\r\n    Shines in your language, and such innocence\r\n    In what you call affection, I must\r\n    Declare you have not plac'd one good thought here,\r\n    Which is not answer'd with my heart. The fire\r\n    Which sparkled in your bosom, long since leap'd\r\n    Into my breast, and there burns modestly:\r\n    It would have spread into a greater flame,\r\n    But still I curb'd it with my tears. Oh, Pyrocles,\r\n    I would thou wert Zelmane again! and yet,\r\n    I must confess I lov'd thee then; I know not\r\n    With what prophetick soul, but I did wish\r\n    Often, thou were a man, or I no woman.\r\n\r\n    _Pyrocles._ Thou wert the comfort of my sleeps.\r\n\r\n    _Philoclea._              And you\r\n    The object of my watches, when the night\r\n    Wanted a spell to cast me into slumber;\r\n    Yet when the weight of my own thoughts grew heavy\r\n    For my tear dropping eyes, and drew these curtains,\r\n    My dreams were still of thee--forgive my blushes--\r\n    And in imagination thou wert then\r\n    My harmless bedfellow.\r\n\r\n    _Pyr._          I arrive too soon\r\n    At my desires. Gently, oh gently, drop\r\n    These joys into me! lest, at once let fall,\r\n    I sink beneath the tempest of my blessings. (III. iv.)\r\n\r\nOr again when he urges her to escape:\r\n\r\n                I could content myself\r\n    To look on Pyrocles, and think it happiness\r\n    Enough; or, if my soul affect variety\r\n    Of pleasure, every accent of thy voice\r\n    Shall court me with new rapture; and if these\r\n    Delights be narrow for us, there is left\r\n    A modest kiss, where every touch conveys\r\n    Our melting souls into each other's lips.\r\n    Why should not you be pleas'd to look on me?\r\n    To hear, and sometimes kiss, Philoclea?\r\n    Indeed you make me blush.       [_Draws a veil over her face_.]\r\n\r\n    _Pyr._            What an eclipse\r\n    Hath that veil made! it was not night till now.\r\n    Look if the stars have not withdrawn themselves,\r\n    As they had waited on her richer brightness,\r\n    And missing of her eyes are stolen to bed. (ib.)\r\n\r\nThese passages display the tenderer side of Shirley's gift at its best,\r\nand prove that, had he but set himself the task, he possessed the very\r\nstyle needed for a successful imitation of the Italian pastoral adapted to\r\nthe temper of the English romantic drama.\r\n\r\nBut Shirley's, though the most complete, was not the earliest attempt at\r\nplacing Sir Philip's romance upon the boards. As long before as 1605 was\r\nacted Day's _Isle of Gulls_, a farcical and no doubt highly topical play,\r\nwhich is equally founded on the _Arcadia_, though it follows the story far\r\nless closely. Day's title was probably suggested by Nashe's _Isle of\r\nDogs_, a satirical play performed in 1597, which brought its author into\r\ntrouble, but if it deserves Mr. Bullen's epithet of 'attractive,' it must\r\nbe admitted that it is almost the only part of the play to which that\r\nepithet can be applied. Day was in no wise concerned to maintain the\r\npolished and artificial dignity of the original; his satiric purpose\r\nindeed called for a very different treatment. The _Isle of Gulls_ is a\r\ncomedy of the broadest and lowest description, almost uniformly lacking in\r\ncharm, notwithstanding a certain skill of dramatization, and the\r\noccurrence of passages which are good enough of their kind. It will easily\r\nbe conceived that a highly ideal and romantic plot treated in the manner\r\nof the realistic farce of low life may offer great opportunities of\r\nsatiric effect; but it must have made the courtly Sidney turn in his grave\r\nto see his gracious puppets debased into the vulgar rogues and trulls of\r\nthe lower-class London drama. Day in no wise sought to hide his\r\nindebtedness, but on the contrary acknowledged in the Induction that his\r\nargument is but 'a little string or Rivolet, drawne from the full streine\r\nof the right worthy Gentleman, Sir Phillip Sydneys well knowne Archadea.'\r\nThe chief differences between the play and its source are as follows.\r\nBasilius and Gynetia--as Day writes the name--are duke and duchess of\r\nArcadia[294]--near which, apparently, the island is situated--Philoclea\r\nand Pamela become Violetta and Hipolita, Pyrocles and Musidorus appear as\r\nLisander and Demetrius, Philanax and Calander from being lords of the\r\ncourt become captains of the castles guarding the island, and Dametas\r\ncomes practically to occupy the post of Lord Chamberlain. Among the more\r\nimportant characters Euarchus disappears and Aminter and Julio, rivals of\r\nthe princes in the ladies' loves, are added, as also Manasses,\r\n'scribe-major' to Dametas. When the princes have at last prevailed upon\r\ntheir loves to elope with them, and tricked as before their various\r\nguardians into leaving the coast clear, they are in their turn persuaded\r\nto leave the ladies in the charge of their disguised rivals, who, of\r\ncourse, secure them as their prizes. Thus the gulling is singularly\r\ncomplete all round, not least among the gulled being the audience, whose\r\nsympathy has been carefully enlisted on the princes' behalf. The last\r\nscene, in which all the characters forgather from their various ludicrous\r\noccupations, is, as might be expected, one of considerable confusion,\r\nwhich is rendered all the more confounded by frequent errors in the\r\nspeakers' names, which remain in spite of the labours of Day's\r\neditor.[295]\r\n\r\nIf we approach the play with Sir Philip's romance in our mind, the\r\ncharacters cannot but appear one and all offensive. In every case Day has\r\nindulged in brutal caricature. The courtly characters are represented from\r\nthe point of view of a prurient-minded bourgeoisie; the rustic figures are\r\nequally gross in their vulgarity; while the traitor Dametas, who serves as\r\na link between the two classes, is an upstart parasite, described with a\r\nsatiric touch not unworthy of Webster as 'a little hillock made great with\r\nothers' ruines.' But if we are content to forget the source of the play,\r\nwe may take a rather more charitable view. Not all the characters are\r\nconsistently revolting, several, including the princesses, having at times\r\na fine flavour of piquant roguishness, at others a touch of easy\r\nsentiment. For a contemporary audience, of course, there were other points\r\nof attraction in the play, for the satirical intent is sufficiently\r\nobvious, though it is needless for us here to inquire into the personages\r\nadumbrated, that investigation belonging neither to pastoral nor to\r\nliterary history properly speaking. By far the cleverest as well as the\r\nmost pleasing scene in the play is that introducing a game of bowls,[296]\r\nduring which Lisander courts Violetta in long-drawn metaphor. Part at\r\nleast of this brilliant double-edged word-play must be quoted, even though\r\nthe verse-capping may at times pass the bounds of strict decorum:\r\n\r\n    _Duke._ Doth our match hold?\r\n\r\n    _Duchess._         Yes, whose part will you take?\r\n\r\n    _Duke._ Zelmanes.\r\n\r\n    _Duchess._    Soft, that match is still to make.\r\n\r\n    _Violetta._ Lets cast a choice, the nearest two take one.\r\n\r\n    _Lisander._ My choice is cast; help sweet occasion.\r\n\r\n    _Viol._ Come, heere's agood.\r\n\r\n    _Lis._         Well, betterd.\r\n\r\n    _Duch._               Best of all:\r\n\r\n    _Lis._ The Duke and I.\r\n\r\n    _Duke._       The weakest goe to the wall.\r\n\r\n    _Viol._ Ile lead.\r\n\r\n    _Lis._     Ile follow.\r\n\r\n    _Viol._        We have both one mind.\r\n\r\n    _Lis._ In what?\r\n\r\n    _Viol._    In leaving the old folke behinde.\r\n\r\n    _Duke._ Well jested, daughter; and you lead not faire,\r\n    The hindmost hound though old may catch the hare.\r\n\r\n    _Duch._ Your last Boule come?\r\n\r\n    _Viol._          By the faith a me well led.\r\n\r\n    _Lis._ Would I might lead you.\r\n\r\n    _Viol._          Whither?\r\n\r\n    _Lis._              To my bed.\r\n\r\n    _Viol._ I am sure you would not.\r\n\r\n    _Lis._           By this aire I would.\r\n\r\n    _Viol._ I hope you would not hurt me and you should.\r\n\r\n    _Lis._ Ide love you, sweet ...\r\n\r\n    _Duke._        Daughter, your bowle winnes one.\r\n\r\n    _Viol._ None, of my Maidenhead, Father; I am gone:\r\n    The Amazon hath wonne one.\r\n\r\n    _Lis._            Yield to that.\r\n\r\n    _Viol._ The cast I doe.\r\n\r\n    _Lis._        Yourselfe?\r\n\r\n    _Viol._           Nay scrape out that. (II. v.)[297]\r\n\r\nThe unprinted dramas founded on the _Arcadia_ need not detain us long.\r\nOne is preserved in a volume of manuscript plays in the British Museum,\r\nand is entitled _Love's Changelings' Change_.[298] It is written in a hand\r\nof the first half of the seventeenth century, small and neat, but, partly\r\non account of the porous nature of the paper, exceedingly hard to read.\r\nThe dramatis personae include a full cast from the _Arcadia_; and somewhat\r\nmore stress appears to be laid on the pastoral elements than is the case\r\nin either of the printed plays. From what I have thought it necessary to\r\ndecipher, however, I see no reason to differ from Mr. Bullen, who\r\ndismisses it as 'a dull play.'[299] The prologue may serve as a specimen\r\nof the style of the piece.\r\n\r\n    This Scaene's prepar'd for those that longe to see\r\n    The crosse Meanders in Loves destinie;\r\n    To see the changes in a shatterd wit\r\n    Proove a man Changlinge in attemptinge it;\r\n    To change a noble minde t'a gloz'd intent\r\n    Beefore such change will let um see th' event.\r\n    This change our Famous Princes had, beefore\r\n    Their borrowed shape could speake um any more,\r\n    And nought but this our Poet feares will seize\r\n    Your liking fancies with that new disease.\r\n    Wee hope the best: all wee can say tis strange\r\n    To heare with patient eares Loves changelinges Change\r\n\r\n--which, if this is a fair sample, is very likely true. Below the prologue\r\nthe writer has added the couplet:\r\n\r\n    Th' old wits are gone: looke for noe new thing by us,\r\n    For _nullum est jam Dictum quod non sit dictum prius_.\r\n\r\nThe other play is preserved in a Bodleian manuscript,[300] and is entitled\r\n'The Arcadian Lovers, or the Metamorphosis of Princes.' 'The name of the\r\nauthor,' writes Mr. Hazlitt following Halliwell, 'was probably Moore, for\r\nin the volume, written by the same hand as the play, is a dedication to\r\nMadam Honoria Lee from the \"meanest of her kinsmen,\" Thomas Moore. A\r\nperson of this name wrote _A Brief Discourse about Baptism_, 1649.' Mr.\r\nFalconer Madan, however, in his catalogue ascribes the manuscript to the\r\nearly eighteenth century, a date certainly more in accordance with the\r\ncharacter of the handwriting. If, therefore, the conjecture concerning the\r\nauthor's name is correct, he may be plausibly identified with the Sir\r\nThomas Moore whose tragedy _Mangora_ was acted in 1717. The manuscript,\r\nwhich contains various poetical essays, includes not only the complete\r\nplay, which is in prose, but also a verse paraphrase of a large portion of\r\nthe same. Neither prose nor verse possesses the least merit.[301]\r\n\r\nThe earliest of the plays founded upon episodes in the _Arcadia_ is\r\nBeaumont and Fletcher's _Cupid's Revenge_, which was acted by the children\r\nof the Queen's Revels, and published in 1615.[302] A revision, possibly by\r\nanother hand, has introduced considerable confusion into the titles of the\r\npersonae, but need not otherwise concern us.[303] The plot of the play is\r\nbased on two episodes in the romance, one relating to the vengeance\r\nexacted by Cupid on the princess Erona of Lycia for an insult offered to\r\nhis worship, the other to the intrigue of prince Plangus of Iberia with\r\nthe wife of a citizen, and the tragic complications arising therefrom.\r\nThese two stories are combined by the dramatists, with no very conspicuous\r\nskill, into one plot. Plangus and Erona, under the names of Leucippus and\r\nHidaspes, are represented as brother and sister, children of the old\r\nwidowed duke of Lysia. They make common cause in seeking to abolish the\r\nworship of Cupid, and their tragedies are represented as alike due to his\r\noffended deity. No sooner has the old duke, yielding to his daughter's\r\nprayers, prohibited the worship of the god, than Hidaspes falls\r\ndesperately in love with the deformed dwarf Zoilus, and begs him in\r\nmarriage of her father. The duke, infuriated at such an exhibition of\r\nunnatural and disordered affection in his daughter, causes the dwarf to be\r\nbeheaded, whereupon the princess languishes and dies.[304] In the\r\nmeanwhile Leucippus has fallen in love with Bacha, the widow of a citizen,\r\nand frequents her house secretly, where being surprised by his father, he\r\nprotests so strongly of her chastity--hoping thereby to save her credit\r\nand his own--that the old duke falls in love with her himself, and shortly\r\nafterwards marries her. Having now become duchess she seeks to renew her\r\nintercourse with the prince, and being repulsed resolves upon revenge. She\r\nmakes the duke believe that his son is plotting against him, and so\r\nsecures his arrest and condemnation, hoping thereby to obtain the crown\r\nfor Urania, her daughter by a previous marriage. The citizens, however,\r\nrise in revolt and rescue Leucippus, who thereupon goes into voluntary\r\nexile. He is followed by Urania, a simple and innocent girl, who, knowing\r\nher mother's designs upon his life, hopes to counteract her malice by\r\nattending on the prince in the disguise of a page. The duchess in fact\r\nsends a man to murder the prince, the attempt being frustrated by Urania,\r\nwho herself receives the blow and dies, the murderer being then slain by\r\nLeucippus. In the meanwhile the duke dies, and the friends of the prince\r\nhasten to him, bringing with them the duchess as a prisoner. She however,\r\nseeing her schemes doomed to failure, nurses revenge, and succeeds in\r\nstabbing Leucippus, then turning the dagger into her own heart.[305]\r\n\r\nMore ink than was necessary has been spilt over the motive of this wildly\r\nmelodramatic play. Seward expressed an opinion that there was nothing in\r\nthe action of the brother and sister deserving such severe retribution. To\r\nhim Mason retorted, with somewhat childish seriousness, that, the\r\ncharacters being supposed pagan, the speech of the princess must be held\r\na sacrilegious blasphemy. So Sidney no doubt intended it, and so Beaumont,\r\nwho was evidently the author of the scene in question, intended it too,\r\nand he would possibly, if left to himself, have executed the rest in a\r\nmanner consonant with this intention. But his collaborator took the\r\nopportunity of adding a scene between certain of the lords of the court,\r\nin which, with characteristic coarseness, he represented the condemned\r\nworship in the light of mere vulgar licence. The fact is that not only the\r\nplaywrights, but, no doubt, the majority of the audience as well, were\r\ninterested chiefly in the extravagance of the plot, and cared little or\r\nnothing for the adequacy of the motive. As a drama the piece is decidedly\r\npoor, and the construction which ends the sister's part of the tragedy in\r\nthe second act leaves much to be desired. There is, moreover, something\r\nparticularly and unnecessarily revolting in Hidaspes' passion for the\r\ndeformed dwarf, and something forced in the contrast between Leucippus'\r\nlicentious relations with Bacha at the beginning of the play and the\r\nself-righteousness of his later attitude. Both faults are unfortunately\r\nrather typical, one of the extravagant colouring affected by the\r\ndramatists, the other of the coarse and hasty characterization to which\r\nFletcher in particular is apt to condescend. There are, however, some good\r\npassages in the play, though it is not always easy to assign them to their\r\nauthor. The scenes in which Urania appears are pretty, though inferior to\r\nthe very similar ones in the nearly contemporary _Philaster_. The song of\r\nthe maidens as they watch by their dying mistress, palinode and dirge in\r\none, is striking in the blending of diverse modes:\r\n\r\n    Cupid, pardon what is past,\r\n    And forgive our sins at last!\r\n    Then we will be coy no more,\r\n    But thy deity adore;\r\n    Troths at fifteen we will plight,\r\n    And will tread a dance each night,\r\n    In the fields or by the fire,\r\n    With the youths that have desire.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Thus I shut thy faded light,\r\n    And put it in eternal night.\r\n    Where is she can boldly say,\r\n    Though she be as fresh as May,\r\n    She shall not by this corpse be laid,\r\n    Ere to-morrow's light do fade? (II. v.)\r\n\r\nThere is a suggestion of better things, too, in the lines:\r\n\r\n                            he is like\r\n    Nothing that we have seen, yet doth resemble\r\n    Apollo, as I oft have fancied him,\r\n    When rising from his bed he stirs himself,\r\n    And shakes day from his hair. (I. iii.)\r\n\r\nThe authors, or one of them, had also learned something of Shakespeare's\r\nquaint humour, as appears in the remark:\r\n\r\n    What should he be beheaded? we shall have it grow so base shortly,\r\n    gentlemen will be out of love with it. (II. iii.)\r\n\r\nThe main plot of the above reappears in _Andromana_, a play which was\r\npublished in 1660 as 'By J. S.' It had probably never been performed when\r\nit was printed, and though the initials were possibly intended to suggest\r\nShirley's authorship, there can be little doubt that he was wholly\r\ninnocent of its parentage. An allusion to Denham's _Sophy_ places the date\r\nof composition after 1642.[306] The plot is taken direct from the\r\n_Arcadia_, the names being retained, and there is nothing to show that the\r\nauthor, whoever he may have been, knew anything of _Cupid's Revenge_. The\r\nstory, however, is practically the same except for the addition of the\r\nepisode of Plangus defeating the Argive rebels, and the omission of the\r\ncharacter which appears as Urania in Beaumont and Fletcher's play and as\r\nPalladius in the original romance. The end is also slightly different.\r\nAfter the prince has been rescued by the citizens, Andromana, the queen,\r\nplots a general massacre. Plangus overhears her conversation with her\r\ninstrument and confidant, and runs him through with his sword on the spot.\r\nAt Andromana's cries the king enters, and she forthwith accuses the\r\nprince of attempting violence towards her; the king stabs his son,\r\nAndromana stabs the king, next the prince's friend Inophilus, and finally\r\nherself. She seems on the whole satisfied with this performance, and with\r\nher last breath exclaims:\r\n\r\n    I have lived long enough to boast an act,\r\n    After which no mischief shall be new.\r\n\r\nLittle need be said of this play. It is wholly lacking in distinction of\r\nany sort or kind, and the last act with the catastrophe is a mere piece of\r\nextravagant botching. There are, however, here and there passages which\r\nare worth rescuing from the general wreck. One of these is the opening of\r\nthe first scene between Plangus and Andromana:\r\n\r\n    _Plangus._ It cannot be so late.\r\n\r\n    _Andromana._        Believe 't, the sun\r\n    Is set, my dear, and candles have usurp'd\r\n    The office of the day.\r\n\r\n    _Plan._         Indeed, methinks\r\n    A certain mist, like darkness, hangs on my eye-lids.\r\n    But too great lustre may undo the sight:\r\n    A man may stare so long upon the sun\r\n    That he may look his eyes out; and certainly\r\n    'Tis so with me: I have so greedily\r\n    Swallow'd thy light that I have spoil'd my own.\r\n\r\n    _And._ Why shouldst thou tempt me to my ruin thus?\r\n    As if thy presence were less welcome to me\r\n    Than day to one who, 'tis so long ago\r\n    He saw the sun, hath forgot what light is. (I. v.)\r\n\r\nOccasional touches, too, are not without flavour:\r\n\r\n    You can create me great, I know, sir,\r\n    But good you cannot. You might compel,\r\n    Entice me too, perhaps, to sin. But\r\n    Can you allay a gnawing conscience,\r\n    Or bind up bleeding reputation? (II. v. end.)\r\n\r\nor, again:\r\n\r\n              Shall I believe a dream?\r\n    Which is a vapour borne along the stream\r\n    Of fancy. (V. iii.)\r\n\r\nThe last in this somewhat dreary catalogue is Glapthorne's _Argalus and\r\nParthenia_, published in 1639 and acted probably the previous year. It is\r\nfounded on the episode related in Books I and III of the _Arcadia_,[307]\r\nand possibly on Quarles' poem already noticed. The story is briefly as\r\nfollows. Demagoras, finding his suit to Parthenia rejected in favour of\r\nArgalus, robs her of her beauty by means of a poisonous herb, an outrage\r\nfor which he is slain by his rival. After a while Parthenia regains her\r\nbeauty through the care and skill of the queen of Corinth, and returns to\r\nher lover. During the marriage festivities the king sends for Argalus to\r\nact as champion against a knight who has carried off his daughter, and\r\nArgalus, obeying the summons, finds himself opposed to his friend\r\nAmphialus. They fight, and Argalus is slain. Parthenia then appears\r\ndisguised as a warrior in armour, challenges Amphialus, and suffers a like\r\nfate. With this inconsequent and unmotived tragedy is interwoven a slight\r\nand incongruous underplot of rustic buffoonery. As a whole Glapthorne's\r\nplay is of inconsiderable merit. Here and there, however, we come upon a\r\npassage which might make us hope better things of the author.[308] Of\r\nArgalus it is said that\r\n\r\n    His gracions merit challenges a wife,\r\n    Faire as Parthenia, did she staine the East,\r\n    When the bright morne hangs day upon her cheeks\r\n    In chaines of liquid pearle. (I. i.)\r\n\r\nDemagoras is a glorious warrior who would compel love as he has done fame.\r\nThough Parthenia reminds him that\r\n\r\n    Mars did not wooe the Queen of Love in Armes,\r\n\r\nhis fierce soul yet dwells on deeds of force:\r\n\r\n                       I'll bring on\r\n    Well-manag'd troops of Souldiers to the fight,\r\n    Draw big battaliaes, like a moving field\r\n    Of standing Corne, blown one way by the wind\r\n    Against the frighted enemy; (ib.)\r\n\r\nand, remembering former conquests:\r\n\r\n                             This brave resolve\r\n    Vanquish'd my steele wing'd Goddesse, and ingag'd\r\n    Peneian Daphne, who did fly the Sun,\r\n    Give up to willing ravishment, her boughes\r\n    T' invest my awfull front. (ib.)\r\n\r\nParthenia, healed from the poison, returns\r\n\r\n                       her right\r\n    Beauty new shining like the Queen of night,\r\n    Appearing fresher after she did shroud\r\n    Her gawdy forehead in a pitchy cloud:\r\n    Love triumphs in her eyes; (III, end.)\r\n\r\nand the pastoral poetess Sapho promises an 'epithalamy' for the bridal\r\npair,\r\n\r\n    Till I sing day from Tethis armes, and fire\r\n    With ayry raptures the whole morning quire,\r\n    Till the small birds their Silvan notes display\r\n    And sing with us, 'Joy to Parthenia!' (ib.)\r\n\r\nInto her mouth, too, is put the following picture of the bride which has\r\nsome kinship with contemporary baroque in Italian architecture and\r\npainting, and also occasionally anticipates in a remarkable manner the\r\ndiction of the following century.\r\n\r\n    The holy Priest had joyn'd their hands, and now\r\n    Night grew propitious to their Bridall vow,\r\n    Majestick Juno, and young Hymen flies\r\n    To light their Pines at faire Parthenia's eyes;\r\n    The little Graces amourously did skip,\r\n    With the small Cupids, from each lip to lip;\r\n    Venus her selfe was present, and untide\r\n    Her virgine Zone;[309] when loe, on either side\r\n    Stood as her handmaids, Chastity and Truth,\r\n    With that immaculate guider of her youth\r\n    Rose-colour'd Modestie: These did undresse\r\n    The beauteous maid, who now in readinesse,\r\n    The Nuptiall tapers waving 'bout her head,\r\n    Made poore her garments, and enrich'd her bed. (IV. i.)\r\n\r\nSo again we find single expressions which are striking, as when Parthenia\r\nbids Amphialus, sooner than appease her wrath, to hope\r\n\r\n    To charme the Genius of the world to peace; (V.)\r\n\r\nor when, dying, she commends herself to her dead lover:\r\n\r\n                                 take my breath\r\n    That flies to thee on the pale wings of death. (ib.)\r\n\r\nAnd yet it would be scarcely unfair to describe these as for the most part\r\nthe beauties of decay; they are as rich embroidery upon rotten cloth, and\r\nare achieved by careful elaboration of sensuous imagination, and the art\r\nof arresting the attention upon a commonplace thought by the use of some\r\nstriking epithet or novel and daring turn of expression. For the wider and\r\nmore essential beauties of conception, character, and construction we look\r\nin vain in Glapthorne's play.\r\n\r\nSidney's _Arcadia_, however, though the most important, was not the only\r\nso-called pastoral romance which left dramatic progeny. It has been\r\ncustomary to describe the _Thracian Wonder_, a play of uncertain\r\nauthorship, as founded upon the story of Curan and Argentile in Warner's\r\n_Albion's England_, a metrical emporium of historical legend very popular\r\nat the close of the sixteenth century. The narrative in question was later\r\nexpanded into a separate work by one William Webster, and published in\r\n1617.[310] That Collier should have given a quite erroneous abstract of\r\nWarner's tale, and should then have proceeded to claim it as the source of\r\nthe play in question, is perhaps no great matter for astonishment, nor\r\nneed it particularly surprise us to find certain modern critics swallowing\r\nthe whole fiction on Collier's authority. What is extraordinary is that a\r\nscholar of Dyce's ability and learning should have been misled. For it is\r\nquite evident that the _Thracian Wonder_ is based, though hardly closely,\r\non no less famous a work than Greene's _Menaphon_.[311] This should of\r\ncourse have been apparent to critics even without the hint supplied by\r\nAntimon in the second scene of Act IV: 'She cannot choose but love me now;\r\nI'm sure old Menaphon ne'er courted in such clothes.' The dramatist,\r\nhowever, has not followed his source slavishly; the pastoral element is\r\nlargely suppressed or at least subordinated, and the catastrophe somewhat\r\naltered. Instead of the siege of the castle by the shepherds when the\r\nheroine is carried off by her own son, we have the following ending. The\r\nking himself carries off his daughter, and her son and husband, ignorant\r\nof course of their mutual relationship, put themselves at the head of the\r\nshepherds in pursuit. At this moment the country is invaded by the king of\r\nSicily, who comes to seek his son, the husband of the heroine, and by the\r\nking of Africa, who comes to avenge the banished brother of the king of\r\nThrace. After much fighting it is resolved to decide the issue by single\r\ncombat, in the course of which explanations ensue which lead to a general\r\nrecognition and reconciliation. The pastoral element is represented by old\r\nAntimon an antic shepherd, a clown his son, his daughter a careless\r\nshepherdess and her despised lover, and a careless shepherd.\r\n\r\nThe play was printed in 1661 by Francis Kirkman, who ascribed it on the\r\ntitle-page to John Webster and William Rowley. All critics are agreed that\r\nthe former at least had nothing to do with the composition; but beyond\r\nthat it is difficult to go. Perhaps the mention of 'old Menaphon' might be\r\ntaken to indicate that the romance was at least not new at the time of the\r\ncomposition of the play, for Menaphon himself was not an old man. In spite\r\nof the small merit of the play from a poetical point of view, and of\r\noccasional extraordinary oversights in the plot--for instance, we are\r\nnever told how the infant who is shipwrecked on the shore, presumably of\r\nArcadia, comes to be a young man in the service of the king of Africa--its\r\nbadness has perhaps been exaggerated, and it is undoubtedly from the pen\r\nof an experienced stage-hack. I do not know, however, that any passage is\r\nworth quotation.[312]\r\n\r\nAny argument in favour of an early date for the _Thracian Wonder_, based\r\non its being founded on Greene's romance, is sufficiently answered by\r\nThomas Forde's _Love's Labyrinth_, which is a much closer dramatization of\r\nthe same story, retaining the names and characters almost unchanged, but\r\nwhich cannot have been written very long before its publication in 1660.\r\nOne episode, the death of Sephistia's mother, a character unknown to\r\nGreene, is apparently borrowed from Gomersall's _Lodovick Sforza_.[313]\r\nThe play, which lies somewhat beyond our limits, represents in its worst\r\nform the _débâcle_ of the old dramatic tradition, continued past its date\r\nby writers who had no technical familiarity with the stage. It is equally\r\nwithout poetic merit, except in a few incidental songs. Of these, some are\r\nborrowed from Greene, one is a translation from Anacreon also printed in\r\nthe author's _Poetical Diversions_, some are original. Of the last, one\r\nmay be worth quoting.[314]\r\n\r\n    Fond love, no more\r\n    Will I adore\r\n      Thy feigned Deity;\r\n    Go throw thy darts\r\n    At simple hearts\r\n      And prove thy victory.\r\n\r\n    Whilst I do keep\r\n    My harmless sheep\r\n      Love hath no power on me;\r\n    'Tis idle soules\r\n    Which he controules,\r\n      The busy man is free.\r\n\r\n    (II. i.)\r\n\r\nReaders of Suckling will recognize the inspiration of the following lines:\r\n\r\n    Why so nice and coy, fair Lady,\r\n      Prithee why so coy?\r\n    If you deny your hand and lip\r\n      Can I your heart enjoy?\r\n      Prithee why so coy?\r\n\r\n    (IV. iii.)\r\n\r\nThere is one obvious omission from the above list of plays founded on\r\npastoral romances, but it has been made intentionally. The interest which\r\nfrom our present point of view attaches to _As You Like It_ lies less in\r\nthe relation of that play to its source in Lodge's romance than to the\r\nfact that in it Shakespeare summed up to a great extent, and by\r\nimplication passed judgement upon, pastoral tradition as a whole. It will\r\ntherefore be more convenient and more appropriate to postpone\r\nconsideration of the piece until we have followed out the influence of\r\nthat tradition, and watched its effect in the wide field of the romantic\r\ndrama, and come at the end ourselves to face the question of the meaning\r\nand the merits of pastoralism as a literary creed.\r\n\r\nLooking back for a moment over the plays just passed in review, it is\r\nimpossible not to be struck by the fact that they present in themselves\r\nbut the slightest traces of pastoral. It is evident that it was not there\r\nthat lay the dramatists' interest in the romances. This observation is\r\nimportant, for the tendency is not confined to those plays which are\r\ndirectly founded on works of the sort. The idea of pastoral current among\r\nthe playwrights, and no doubt among the audience too, was largely derived\r\nfrom novels such as the _Arcadia_, and, as we have seen, the tradition of\r\nthese works was one rather of polite chivalry and courtly adventure than\r\nof pastoralism proper. Had no other forces been at work the tradition of\r\nthe stage influenced by the romances would have probably shown no trace of\r\npastoral at all. As it was, something of a genuinely pastoral tradition\r\narose out of the mythological plays and the attempts at imitating the\r\nItalian drama, and this combined with the more popular but less genuine\r\npastoralism of the romances to produce the peculiar hybrid which we\r\ncommonly find passing under the name of pastoral in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pastoral tradition, such as it was, that thus formed itself on the\r\nEnglish stage remained to the end hesitating, tentative, and undefined. At\r\nno time did it become an enveloping atmosphere of artistic creation.\r\nAuthors approached it as it were from the outside, from no sense of inner\r\ncompulsion, but experimentally from the broader standpoint of the romantic\r\ndrama, and with the air of pioneers and innovators, as if ignorant of what\r\nhad been already achieved in the same line by their predecessors.\r\nConsequently, in spite of the considerable following it enjoyed, this\r\nromantic-pastoral tradition lacked vitality, and failed as a rule to\r\nattract authors of more pre-eminent powers. We have already seen how the\r\nthree chief English experiments stand apart from it, and we shall find as\r\nwe proceed that there are other plays as well which it is difficult to\r\nbring strictly into line, though they are not in themselves of sufficient\r\nimportance to claim separate consideration. In some measure, indeed, it\r\nmay be truly said that, like the history of the Senecan drama or of\r\nclassical versification, the history of the dramatic pastoral in England\r\nis that of a long series of incoherent and more or less fruitless\r\nexperiments. There is, however, an important difference between the two\r\ncases, for in the pastoral we are at least aware of a striving towards\r\nsome new and but dimly apprehended form of artistic expression. It is true\r\nthat this was never attained; and looking back from the vantage-ground of\r\ntime we may doubt whether after all it was worth attaining, but it serves\r\nto differentiate the pastoral experiment from those others whose object\r\nwas but the revival of a past for ever vanished. The English pastoral\r\ndrama had one advantage at least over many other literary fopperies, in\r\nthat it obeyed the fundamental law of literary progress, which is one with\r\nartistic evolution.\r\n\r\nA chronological survey of the regular plays to be classed as pastorals\r\nwill best serve the needs of our present inquiry, and for this purpose it\r\nis fortunate that in nearly all cases we possess evidence which enables us\r\nto date the work with tolerable accuracy, while the few which yet remain\r\ndoubtful are themselves unimportant, and probably fall near the limit of\r\nour period. Even, however, were this not so, the singular independence of\r\nmost of the pieces and the absence of any visible line of development\r\nwould make uncertainty as to their order of far less consequence here than\r\nin many departments of literary history in which similar evidence is\r\nunhappily wanting.\r\n\r\nIn substance, then, the romantic pastoral in England was a combination of\r\nthe Arcadian drama of Italy with the chivalric romance of Spain, as\r\nfamiliarized through the medium of Sidney's work, and also, though less\r\nconsistently, with the never very fully developed tradition of the\r\nmythological play. In form, again, it may be said to represent the\r\nmingling of the conventions of the Italian drama with the freer action and\r\nmore direct and dramatic presentation of the romantic stage. The earliest\r\nplay in which these characteristics are found is the anonymous _Maid's\r\nMetamorphosis_, printed and probably acted 'by the Children of Powles' in\r\n1600.[315] The plot, which from the blending of different elements it\r\npresents is of considerable historical interest, is briefly as follows.\r\nEurymine, of whose connexions we hear nothing but that she is supposed to\r\nbe lowly born, and Ascanio, the duke's son, are in love. The duke,\r\ndiscovering this, orders two of his retainers to lead Eurymine secretly\r\ninto the forest and there slay her. Her youth and beauty, however, touch\r\ntheir hearts, and they agree to spare her on condition that she shall live\r\namong the country folk, and never return to court. They have no sooner\r\nleft her than she meets with a shepherd and a hunter, who both fall in\r\nlove on the spot, and whose rivalry supplies her with the means of\r\nlivelihood. Ascanio now appears in search of his love, and is directed by\r\nMorpheus, at the hest of Juno, to seek out a certain hermit, who will be\r\nable to advise him. In the meantime, however, an unexpected complication\r\nhas arisen. Apollo, meeting Eurymine in her shepherdess' disguise, has\r\nfallen violently in love, and threatens mischief. To escape from his\r\npursuit she craves a boon, and having extorted a promise from the\r\ninfatuated god, demands that he shall change her into a man. Much\r\nregretting his rash promise, Apollo complies. The next thing that happens\r\nis that the lovers meet. This is distinctly unsatisfactory, but at the\r\nsuggestion of the hermit 'three or four Muses' and the 'Charities' or\r\nGraces are called in to help, and by their prayers at length induce Apollo\r\nto relent and restore Eurymine to her original sex. No sooner is this\r\nperformed than she is discovered to be the daughter of the hermit, and he\r\nthe exiled prince of Lesbos. At this juncture arrives a messenger from the\r\nduke, begging Ascanio to return to court, and adding casually, as it\r\nseems, that should Eurymine happen to be still alive she too will be\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\nThus we see the threefold weft, Arcadian, courtly, and mythological,\r\nweaving the fantastic web of the earliest of the romantic pastorals. Of\r\nthe influence of the drama of Tasso and Guarini there is, indeed, but\r\nlittle, the plot being in no wise that of orthodox tradition; but shepherd\r\nand ranger are true Arcadians, neither disguised courtiers nor rustic\r\nclowns, as in the Sidneian romance. The author, whoever he was, may have\r\ndrawn a hint for his plot from Lyly's _Gallathea_, in which, it will be\r\nremembered, Venus promises to change one of the enamoured maidens into a\r\nman, or else, maybe, direct from the tale of Iphis in Ovid.[316] As to the\r\nsources of the other elements, it will be sufficient for our purpose to\r\nnote that the verse portions of the play are rimed throughout in couplets,\r\na fact that carries them back towards Peele's _Arraignment_ and the days\r\nprevious to Marlowe. The slight comic business is in prose, and the\r\ncharacters of the three young rogues are directly traceable to the waggish\r\npages of Lyly.[317]\r\n\r\nThe piece has the appearance of being a youthful work; the verse is often\r\nirregular and clumsy, and the rimes uncertain. On the whole, however, it\r\ncontains not a little that is graceful and pleasing to the ear, while in\r\ndescription the unknown author shows himself a faithful and not\r\nunsuccessful disciple of Spenser in his idyllic mood. Here, for instance,\r\nare two passages which have been thought to reveal a study of the\r\nmaster:[318]\r\n\r\n    Within this ore-growne Forrest, there is found\r\n    A duskie Cave, thrust lowe into the ground:\r\n    So ugly darke, so dampie and so steepe,\r\n    As for his life the sunne durst never peepe\r\n    Into the entrance: which doth so afright\r\n    The very day, that halfe the world is night.\r\n    Where fennish fogges, and vapours do abound:\r\n    There Morpheus doth dwell within the ground,\r\n    No crowing Cocke, nor waking bell doth call,\r\n    Nor watchfull dogge disturbeth sleepe at all.\r\n    No sound is heard in compasse of the hill,\r\n    But every thing is quiet, whisht, and still.\r\n    Amid this Cave, upon the ground doth lie,\r\n    A hollow plancher, all of Ebonie\r\n    Cover'd with blacke, whereon the drowsie God,\r\n    Drowned in sleepe, continually doth nod. (II. i. 112.)\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n    Then in these verdant fields al richly dide,\r\n    With natures gifts, and Floras painted pride:\r\n    There is a goodly spring whose christal streames\r\n    Beset with myrtles, keepe backe Phoebus beames:\r\n    There in rich seates all wrought of Ivory,\r\n    The Graces sit, listening the melodye:\r\n    The warbling Birds doo from their prettie billes\r\n    Unite in concord, as the brooke distilles,\r\n    Whose gentle murmure with his buzzing noates\r\n    Is as a base unto their hollow throates.\r\n    Garlands beside they weare upon their browes,\r\n    Made of all sorts of flowers earth allowes:\r\n    From whence such fragrant sweet perfumes arise,\r\n    As you would sweare that place is Paradise. (V. i. 104.)\r\n\r\nThe same influence may perhaps be traced in slighter sketches, such as the\r\n\r\n                                grassie bed\r\n    With sommers gawdie dyaper bespred. (II. i. 55.)\r\n\r\nHere is a passage in another strain, which culminates in a touch of\r\nhaunting melody that Spenser himself might have envied:\r\n\r\n    I marvell that a rusticke shepheard dare\r\n    With woodmen thus audaciously compare?\r\n    Why, hunting is a pleasure for a King,\r\n    And Gods themselves sometime frequent the thing.\r\n    Diana with her bowe and arrowes keene,\r\n    Did often use the Chace, in Forrests greene.\r\n    And so alas, the good Athenian knight,\r\n    And swift Acteon herein tooke delight:\r\n    And Atalanta the Arcadian dame,\r\n    Conceiv'd such wondrous pleasure in the game,\r\n    That with her traine of Nymphs attending on,\r\n    She came to hunt the Bore of Calydon. (I. i. 318.)\r\n\r\nWe have also the introduction of an Echo scene--the earliest, I suppose,\r\nin English. A notable feature of the play, on the other hand, are the\r\nsongs, which are in some cases of rare excellence, and certain of which\r\nbear a resemblance to those found in Lyly's plays. In the lines sung by\r\nEurymine--\r\n\r\n    Ye sacred Fyres, and powers above,\r\n    Forge of desires working love,\r\n    Cast downe your eye, cast downe your eye\r\n    Upon a Mayde in miserie--(I. i. 131.)\r\n\r\nthere is a subtlety of sound rare even in the work of lyrists of\r\nacknowledged merit. Again, there is a fine swing in the song:\r\n\r\n    Round about, round about, in a fine Ring a:\r\n    Thus we daunce, thus we daunce, and thus we sing a.\r\n    Trip and go, too and fro[319], over this Greene a:\r\n    All about, in and out, for our brave Queene a. (II. ii. 105.)\r\n\r\nThe best of these songs, however, and indeed the gem of the whole play, is\r\nundoubtedly the duet of the shepherd and the ranger, as they call upon\r\nEurymine, with its striking crescendo of antiphonal effect:\r\n\r\n    _Gemulo._ As little Lambes lift up their snowie sides,\r\n    When mounting Larke salutes the gray-eyed morne--\r\n\r\n    _Silvio._ As from the Oaken leaves the honie glides,\r\n    Where Nightingales record upon the thorne--\r\n\r\n    _Ge._ So rise my thoughts--\r\n\r\n    _Sil._                      So all my sences cheere--\r\n\r\n    _Ge._ When she surveyes my flocks--\r\n\r\n    _Sil._                             And she my Deare.\r\n\r\n    _Ge._ Eurymine!\r\n\r\n    _Sil._      Eurymine!\r\n\r\n    _Ge._            Come foorth!\r\n\r\n    _Sil._              Come foorth!\r\n\r\n    _Ge._                  Come foorth and cheere these plaines!\r\n\r\n    _Both._ Eurymine, come foorth and cheere these plaines--\r\n\r\n    _Sil._ The Wood-mans Love--\r\n\r\n    _Ge._                 And Lady of the Swaynes[320] (IV. ii. 39.)\r\n\r\nNot long after the appearance of the _Maid's Metamorphosis_ there was\r\nwritten a play entitled _The Fairy Pastoral, or the Forest of Elves_,\r\nwhich is preserved in a manuscript belonging to the Duke of Devonshire,\r\nand was printed as long ago as 1824 by Joseph Haslewood, for the Roxburghe\r\nClub. The author was William Percy, third son of Henry, eighth Earl of\r\nNorthumberland, and the friend of Barnabe Barnes at Oxford, but of whose\r\nlife, beyond the facts of its obscurity and seeming misery, little or\r\nnothing is known. He left several manuscript plays, of which the present\r\nat least, dated 1603[321] at 'Wolves Hill, my Parnassus,' possesses\r\nneither interest nor merit. It is an amateurish performance, partly in\r\nprose, partly in verse, either blank or rimed in couplets. Where the\r\nauthor adopts verse as a vehicle, his language becomes crabbed and\r\nungrammatical in its endeavour to accommodate itself to the unwonted\r\nrestraint of metre, which it nevertheless fails to do. It is also apt to\r\nbe laden to the point of obscurity with strange verbal mintage of the\r\nauthor's own. The plot is not strictly pastoral at all, the only\r\ncharacters that supply anything traditional in this line being the fairy\r\nhunters and huntresses. Oberon, having heard that Hypsiphyle, the princess\r\nof Elvida or the Forest of Elves, neglects her charge and suffers the\r\nwoods and quarry to decay, sends Orion to take over the government and\r\nreform the abuses. The princess refuses to resign her authority, and a\r\nhunting contest ensues, in which, though she is vanquished, she in her\r\nturn overcomes her victor, and finally shares with him the fairy throne.\r\nWhile this plot is in action three careless huntresses play tricks on\r\ntheir enamoured hunters, and, being fooled in their turn, at last consent\r\nto reward the service of their lovers. The scenes are spun out by a thread\r\nof broad farce, supported by the fairy children, their schoolmaster, and\r\nhis wench. Some of the obscenity of this part may be elaborated from\r\npassages in the _Maid's Metamorphosis_. The piece has a prologue for\r\nrepresentation at court, but it is most unlikely that it ever had that\r\nhonour. It is from beginning to end a graceless and mirthless composition.\r\n\r\nPassing over the _Faithful Shepherdess_ in 1609, we come to a play of a\r\nvery different order from the last, namely, Phineas Fletcher's\r\n_Sicelides_, a piscatorial, written for presentation before King James at\r\nCambridge in 1614-5, though he left without seeing it. It was acted before\r\nthe University at King's College, on March 13, and printed,\r\nsurreptitiously it would appear, in 1631[322]. It is not easy to account\r\nfor the neglect which has usually fallen to the lot of this play at the\r\nhands of critics[323]. No doubt among writers generally it has shared the\r\nneglect commonly bestowed on pastorals, while among those more\r\nparticularly concerned with our present subject it has possibly been\r\noverlooked as being piscatory. The fisher-poem, however, as we have\r\nalready seen, is merely a variant of the pastoral, and must be included\r\nunder the same general heading, while the play itself has no less poetic\r\nmerit, and is certainly far more entertaining than the piscatory eclogues\r\nof the same author. The scene, as the title implies, is laid in Sicily,\r\nwhich was natural enough, or indeed inevitable, in the case of a writer\r\nwho would himself in all confidence have pointed to Theocritus as the\r\nfountain-head of his inspiration.\r\n\r\nPerindus loves Glaucilla, the daughter of Glaucus and Circe, and his\r\naffection is returned. In consequence, however, of an oracle he feigns\r\nindifference towards her, and though heart-sick when alone, meets her with\r\nmockery when she pleads her love. Meanwhile Perindus' sister, Olinda, is\r\ncourted by Glaucilla's brother, Thalander, to whose suit, however, she\r\nturns a deaf ear, and at last bids him leave the country. He does so, but\r\nsoon returns in disguise, resolved on winning her. She in the meantime has\r\nrelented of her coldness, and is pining for his love. An opportunity soon\r\noffers itself for his purpose. By mistake or through ignorance she plucks\r\nthe Hesperian apples in the sacred grove, an offence for which she is\r\ncondemned to be offered as a sacrifice to a monster who inhabits a cave on\r\nthe shore, and is known by the name of Maleorchus. Andromeda-like, she is\r\nbound to a rock, and the orc is in the very act of rushing upon its prey,\r\nwhen Thalander interposes and succeeds in slaying the monster. Meanwhile\r\nCosma--'a light nymph of Messina,' who replaces the 'wanton nymph of\r\nCorinth' of the Arcadian cast--has fallen in love with Perindus, and,\r\ndetermining to get rid at a stroke both of his sister Olinda and his\r\nmistress Glaucilla, gives the former a poison under pretence of a\r\nlove-cure. Glaucilla hearing of this, and suspecting the supposed philtre,\r\nmingles with it an antidote, so that when Olinda drinks it she only falls\r\ninto a death-like trance. Hereupon Cosma accuses Glaucilla of substituting\r\na poison for the philtre. She is condemned to be cast from the cliffs, but\r\nPerindus comes forward and claims to die in her place. He is actually cast\r\nfrom the rocks, but falling into the sea is rescued by two fishermen.\r\nThese, we may notice, are borrowed from the twenty-first idyl of\r\nTheocritus, and supply, together with Cosma's page and lovers, a comic\r\nunder-plot to the play. Olinda now revives, Thalander discovering her love\r\nfor him reveals himself, and Perindus' oracle being fulfilled, all ends\r\nhappily, the festivities being crowned by the entirely unexpected and\r\nuncalled-for return of Tyrinthus, the father of Perindus and Olinda, who\r\nhad been carried off long before by pirates.\r\n\r\nThis somewhat complex plot, the dependence of which on the Italian\r\npastoral is evident, is padded with a good deal of farce, but though the\r\nconstruction never evinces any great power on the part of the author, it\r\nis not on the whole inadequate. The verse is in great part rimed in\r\ncouplets, and there are frequent attempts at epigrammatic effect, which at\r\ntimes lead to some obscurity. The language betrays, as in the case of the\r\nauthor's eclogues, a pseudo-archaism, which points, particularly in such\r\nphrases as 'doe ycleape,' to a perhaps unfortunate study of Spenser.\r\nOccasionally we meet with topical allusions, for instance the thrust at\r\nTaylor put into the mouth of the rude Cancrone:\r\n\r\n    Farewell ye rockes and seas, I thinke yee'l shew it\r\n    That Sicelie affords a water-Poet. (II. vi.)\r\n\r\nThe stealing of the Hesperian apples, and the penalty entailed, appear to\r\nbe imitated from the breaking of Pan's tree in Browne's _Britannia's\r\nPastorals_, as does also the devotion and rescue of Perindus[324]. The orc\r\nprobably owes its origin, directly or indirectly, to Ariosto, and the\r\ninfluence of the _Metamorphoses_ is likewise, as so often, present. The\r\nfollowing is perhaps a rather favourable specimen of the verse, but many\r\nshort passages and phrases of merit might be quoted:\r\n\r\n    The Oxe now feeles no yoke, all labour sleepes,\r\n    The soule unbent, this as her play-time keepes,\r\n    And sports it selfe in fancies winding streames,\r\n    Bathing his thoughts in thousand winged dreames ...\r\n    Only love waking rests and sleepe despises,\r\n    Sets later then the sunne, and sooner rises.\r\n    With him the day as night, the night as day,\r\n    All care, no rest, all worke, no holy-day.\r\n    How different from love is lovers guise!\r\n    He never opes, they never shut their eyes. (III. vi.)\r\n\r\nTen years at least, and probably more, intervened before the next pastoral\r\nthat has survived appeared on the stage. This is a somewhat wild\r\nproduction, of small merit, though of some historical interest, entitled\r\n_The Careless Shepherdess._ It was printed many years after its original\r\nproduction, namely in 1656, and then purported to be written by 'T. G. Mr.\r\nof Arts,' who was identified with Thomas Goffe by Kirkman; nor has this\r\nascription ever been challenged. Goffe was resident till 1620 at Oxford,\r\nwhere his classical tragedies were performed, after which he held the\r\nliving of East Clandon in Surrey till his death in July, 1629. It is\r\nprobably to these later years that his attempt at pastoral belongs, but\r\nthe actual date of composition must rest upon conjecture. It was, we are\r\ninformed on the title-page, performed before their majesties (at\r\nWhitehall, the prologue adds), and also publicly at Salisbury Court, the\r\nplayhouse in the Strand, opened in 1629. Consequently the 'praeludium,'\r\nthe scene of which is laid in the new theatre, must belong to the last\r\nmonths of the author's life[325]. The question of the date is interesting\r\nprincipally on account of certain lines which bear a somewhat striking\r\nresemblance to those which stand at the opening of Jonson's _Sad\r\nShepherd_:\r\n\r\n    This was her wonted place, on these green banks\r\n    She sate her down, when first I heard her play\r\n    Unto her lisning sheep; nor can she be\r\n    Far from the spring she's left behinde. That Rose\r\n    I saw not yesterday, nor did that Pinke\r\n    Then court my eye; She must be here, or else\r\n    That gracefull Marygold wo'd shure have clos'd\r\n    Its beauty in her withered leaves, and that\r\n    Violet too wo'd hang its velvet head\r\n    To mourn the absence of her eyes[326]. (V. vii.)\r\n\r\nThe general poetic merit of the piece is, except for these lines, slight,\r\nwhile the songs and lyrical passages, which are rather freely\r\ninterspersed, are almost all wooden and unmusical. Such interest as the\r\nplay possesses is dependent on the plot. We have the conventional four\r\ncharacters: Arismena, the careless shepherdess, her lover Philaritus, and\r\nCastarina, whose affections lean towards the last, though she does not\r\nobject to hold out some hope to her lover Lariscus. Philaritus is the son\r\nof Cleobulus, who is described as 'a gentleman of Arcadia,' and opposes\r\nhis son's marriage with the daughter of a mere shepherd to the point of\r\ndisowning him, whereupon the lover dons the pastoral garb, and so\r\ncontinues his suit to his unresponsive mistress. Castarina meanwhile\r\ninforms her lover that she will show no favour to any suitor until the\r\nreturn of her banished father, Paromet. Both swains are of course in\r\ndespair at the cruelty of their loves, but the behaviour of the nymphs is\r\nthroughout marked by a certain sanity of feeling, which contrasts with the\r\nexaggerated devotions, and yet more exaggerated iciness, of their Italian\r\npredecessors. Philaritus, in the hope of rousing Arismena to jealousy,\r\nfeigns love to Castarina, who readily meets his advances. He is so far\r\nsuccessful that he awakes his mistress to the fact that she really loves\r\nhim, but she determines to play the same trick upon him by feigning in her\r\nturn to love Lariscus. This has the immediate effect of making Philaritus\r\nchallenge his supposed rival, who, having witnessed his pretended advances\r\nto Castarina, eagerly responds. Their meeting is, however, interrupted, in\r\nthe one tolerably good scene in the play, by the appearance of the two\r\nshepherdesses, who threaten to slay one another unless their lovers\r\ndesist. Arismena's coldness, it may be mentioned, has been shaken by\r\nPhilaritus having rescued her from the pursuit of a satyr, and the two\r\nmaidens now consent to make return for the long suit of their lovers.\r\nWhile, however, they are yet in the first transport of joy, a troop of\r\nsatyrs appear, and carry off the girls by force, leaving the lovers to a\r\ndespair rendered all the more bitter for Philaritus by the announcement\r\nthat his father relents of his anger, and is willing to countenance his\r\nmarriage with Arismena. After a vain search for traces of their loves the\r\nswains return home, where they are met by the same satyrs, still guarding\r\ntheir captives. They offer to run at them, when the two leaders discover\r\nthemselves as the fathers respectively of Philaritus and Arismena. No\r\nsatisfactory account of their motive for this outrage is offered, for\r\nwhile they are disputing of the matter the other satyrs, supposed to be\r\ntheir servants in disguise, suddenly disappear with the girls.\r\nConsternation follows, and great preparations are made for pursuit.\r\nArismena and Castarina, however, apparently escape from their captors, for\r\nwe next find them sleeping quietly in an arbour. Again a satyr enters, and\r\ncarries off Arismena, whom Castarina on waking follows to the dwelling of\r\nthe satyrs, where she finds her friend being courted by her captor.\r\nMeanwhile the rash pursuers have fallen into the hands of the pursued, and\r\nare brought in bound. Matters appear desperate, and the nymphs are\r\nactually brought on the stage apparently dead and lying in their coffins.\r\nThey soon, however, show themselves to be alive, and the chief satyr\r\nreveals himself as the banished Paromet, who has been endeavouring to\r\ninduce Arismena to marry him, in the hope thereby to get his sentence of\r\nbanishment revoked. This, it appears, has already been done, and all now\r\nends happily.\r\n\r\nIn this chaotic medley it will be observed that the plot is twice ravelled\r\nand loosed before the final solution. In the frequent _enlèvements_ by the\r\nsatyrs, as in the manner in which these deceive their employer, the story\r\ndistantly recalls Ingegneri's _Danza di Venere_. One feature of importance\r\nis the comic character Graculus, who is well fooled by the pretended\r\nsatyrs, and has an amusing though coarse part in prose. He seems to owe\r\nhis origin to the broad humours of the vulgar stage, though he may be in a\r\nmeasure imitated from the roguish pages of Lyly, and so be the forerunner\r\nof Randolph's Dorylas. The tradition of the comic scenes, usually written\r\nin prose, was in process of crystallization, and from the _Maid's\r\nMetamorphosis_ we can trace it onwards through the present piece, and such\r\nslighter compositions as the _Converted Robber_ and Tatham's _Love Crowns\r\nthe End_, to Randolph and even later writers. In the present case it was\r\nno innovation, nor is there any reason to suppose that it was unpopular\r\nwith the audience.[327] What was an innovation was the 'gentleman of\r\nArcadia,' a character for which the Spanish romance was without doubt\r\nresponsible. In the Italian pastoral proper the shepherds are themselves\r\nthe aristocracy of Arcadia, the introduction of such social hierarchy as\r\nis implied in the phrase being a point of chivalric and courtly tradition.\r\nCleobulus, however, as well as his son Philaritus, is in fact purely\r\nArcadian in character. Among other personae we find Apollo and the Sibyls,\r\nintroduced for the sake of an oracle; Silvia, who more or less fills the\r\noffice of priestess of Pan, and leads the shepherds to his shrine in a\r\nsort of masque; and a very superfluous 'Bonus Genius' of Castarina. This\r\nmythological element, however, though suggested, is not, any more than the\r\ncourtly, put to the fore. I quote Silvia's song as the best example of the\r\nlyrical verse of the play:\r\n\r\n    Come Shepherds come, impale your brows\r\n    With Garlands of the choicest flowers\r\n                     The time allows.\r\n    Come Nymphs deckt in your dangling hair,\r\n    And unto Sylvia's shady Bowers\r\n                     With hast repair:\r\n    Where you shall see chast Turtles play,\r\n    And Nightingales make lasting May,\r\n    As if old Time his youthfull minde,\r\n    To one delightful season had confin'd. (II. i.)\r\n\r\nThere is one thing that can be said in favour of the pastoral written by\r\nRalph Knevet for the Society of Florists at Norwich, namely, that while\r\nadhering mainly to tradition, it is not indebted to any individual works.\r\nOf the author of _Rhodon and Iris_, as the play was called, little is\r\nknown beyond the dates of his birth and death, 1600 and 1671, and the bare\r\nfacts that he was at one time connected in the capacity of tutor or\r\nchaplain with the family of Sir William Paston of Oxmead, and after the\r\nrestoration held the living of Lyng in Norfolk. The play appears to have\r\nbeen performed at the Florists' feast on May 3, 1631, and was printed the\r\nsame year. The object the author had in view was the characterization of\r\ncertain flowers in the persons of nymphs and shepherds; other characters\r\nare allegorical personifications, while Flora herself plays the part of\r\nthe pastoral god from the machine. The weakness of the plot, as in so many\r\ncases, lies in the existence of two main threads of interest, whose\r\nconnexion is wholly fortuitous, and neither of which is clearly\r\nsubordinated to the other. In the present case no attempt is made to\r\ninterweave the chivalric motive, in which Rhodon stands as champion of the\r\noppressed Violetta, with the pastoral motive of his love for Iris. It is,\r\nmoreover, hardly possible to credit the play with a plot at all, since one\r\nthread is cut short by a _dea ex machina_ of the most mechanical sort,\r\nwhile in the other there is never any complication at all. The following\r\nis the outline of the action. The proud shepherd Martagan has encroached\r\non and wasted the lands of Violetta, the sister of Rhodon, to whom she\r\nappeals for protection. The latter determines to demand reparation of\r\nMartagan, and, in case of his refusal, to offer battle on his sister's\r\nbehalf. In the meantime, warned, as we are told, by the stars, he has\r\nabandoned his love Eglantine, and incontinently fallen in love with Iris.\r\nThe forsaken nymph seeks the aid of a witch, Poneria (Wickedness), who\r\nwith her associate Agnostus (Ignorance) is supporting the pretensions of\r\nMartagan. Poneria supplies Eglantine with a poison under pretence of a\r\nlove-philtre, with instructions to administer it to Rhodon disguised as\r\nhis love Iris, which she succeeds in doing. Meanwhile Martagan has refused\r\nto come to terms, and either side prepares for war. Violetta and Iris send\r\nRhodon charms and salves for wounds by the hand of their servant Panace\r\n(All-heal), who happily arrives just as he has drunk the poison, and is in\r\ntime to cure him. Rhodon now prepares for battle under the belief that\r\nIris has sought his death, but being assured of her faith, he vows a\r\ndouble vengeance on his foes, to whose deceit he next attributes the\r\nattempt. The forces are about to join battle when, in response to the\r\nprayers of the nymphs, Flora appears and bids the warriors hold. Martagan\r\nshe commands to refrain from the usurped territory, and charges his\r\nfollowers to keep the peace and abide by her award. Poneria and Agnostus\r\nshe banishes from the land, and Eglantine for seeking unlawful means to\r\nher love is condemned to ten years' penance in a 'vestal Temple.' Thus\r\nRhodon is free to celebrate his nuptials with Iris, though the matter is\r\nonly referred to in the epilogue.\r\n\r\nThe plot, it will be seen, is anything but that of a pure pastoral. The\r\nlarge chivalric or at least martial element belongs less to the courtly\r\nand Spanish type than to that of works like _Menaphon_, or even _Daphnis\r\nand Chloe_. There is also a comic motive between Clematis and her fellow\r\nservant Gladiolus, which turns on the wardrobe and cosmetics of Eglantine\r\nand Poneria, and belongs to the tradition of court and city. The\r\nallegorical characters find their nearest parallel in those of the\r\n_Queen's Arcadia_.[328]\r\n\r\nThis amateurish effort is composed for the most part in a strangely\r\nunmetrical attempt at blank verse. It differs from the doggerel of the\r\n_Fairy Pastoral_ in making no apparent attempt at scansion at all, and so\r\nat least escapes the crabbedness of Percy's language. It is not easy to\r\nsee how the author came to write in this curious compromise between verse\r\nand prose, since it is more or less freely interspersed with passages both\r\nin blank verse and in couplets, which, while exhibiting no conspicuous\r\npoetical qualities, are both metrical and pleasing enough. Take, for\r\nexample, the lines from Eglantine's lament:\r\n\r\n    Since that the gods will not my woe redresse,\r\n    Since men are altogether pittilesse,\r\n    Ye silent ghosts unto my plaints give eare;\r\n    Give ear, I say, ye ghosts, if ghosts can heare,\r\n    And listen to my plaints that doe excell\r\n    The dol'rous tune of ravish'd Philomel.\r\n    Now let Ixions wheele stand still a while,\r\n    Let Danaus daughters now surcease their toyle,\r\n    Let Sisyphus rest on his restlesse stone,\r\n    Let not the Apples flye from Plotas sonne,\r\n    And let the full gorg'd Vultur cease to teare\r\n    The growing liver of the ravisher;\r\n    Let these behold my sorrows and confesse\r\n    Their paines doe farre come short of my distresse. (II. iii.)\r\n\r\nOr take Clematis' prayer for her mistress Eglantine:\r\n\r\n    Thou gentle goddesse of the woods and mountains,\r\n    That in the woods and mountains art ador'd,\r\n    The Maiden patronesse of chaste desires,\r\n    Who art for chastity renouned most,\r\n    Tresgrand Diana, who hast power to cure\r\n    The rankling wounds of Cupids golden arrowes,\r\n    Thy precious balsome deigne thou to apply\r\n    Unto the heart of wofull Eglantine. (I. iii.)\r\n\r\nOr yet again, in lighter mood, Acanthus' boast:\r\n\r\n    When Sol shall make the Easterne Seas his bed,\r\n    When Wolves and Sheepe shall be together fed,...\r\n    When Venus shal turn Chast, and Bacchus become sober,\r\n    When fruit in April's ripe, that blossom'd in October,...\r\n    When Art shal be esteem'd, and golden pelfe laid down,\r\n    When Fame shal tel all truth, and Fortune cease to frown,\r\n    To Cupids yoke then I my necke will bow;\r\n    Till then, I will not feare loves fatall blow. (I. ii.)\r\n\r\nYet the author of the above passages--for there is no reason to suppose a\r\nsecond hand, and the play was published under his own direction--chose to\r\nwrite the main portion of his poem in a measure of this sort:\r\n\r\n    Oh impotent desires, allay the sad consort\r\n    Of a sublime Fortune, whose most ambitious flames\r\n    Disdaine to burne in simple Cottages,\r\n    Loathing a hard unpolish'd bed;\r\n    But Coveting to shine beneath a Canopy\r\n    Of rich Sydonian purple, all imbroider'd\r\n    With purest gold, and orientall Pearles. (I. iii.)\r\n\r\nWhy he should have so chosen I cannot presume to say; whether from haste\r\nand carelessness, or from a deliberate intention of writing a sort of\r\nmeasured prose; but it was certainly from no inability to be metrical. The\r\noccasional lyrics, moreover, are not without merit; the following lines,\r\nsung by Eglantine, are perhaps the most pleasing in the play:\r\n\r\n    Upon the blacke Rocke of despaire\r\n      My youthfull joyes are perish'd quite;\r\n    My hopes are vanish'd into ayre,\r\n      My day is turn'd to gloomy night;\r\n    For since my Rhodon deare is gone,\r\n      Hope, light, nor comfort, have I none.\r\n    A Cell where griefe the Landlord is\r\n      Shall be my palace of delight,\r\n    Where I will wooe with votes and sighes\r\n      Sweet death to end my sorrowes quite;\r\n    Since I have lost my Rhodon deare,\r\n      Deaths fleshlesse armes why should I feare? (I. iii.)\r\n\r\nTo treat of Walter Montagu's _Shepherds' Paradise_ at a length at all\r\ncommensurate with its own were to set a premium on dull prolixity; there\r\nare, however, in spite of its restricted merits, a few points which give\r\nit a claim upon our attention. A brief analysis will suffice. The King of\r\nCastile negotiates a marriage between his son and the princess of Navarre.\r\nThe former, however, is in love with a lady of the court named Fidamira,\r\nwho repulses his advances in favour of Agenor, a friend of the prince's.\r\nThe prince therefore resolves to leave the court and seek the Shepherds'\r\nParadise, a sequestered vale inhabited by a select and courtly company,\r\nand induces Agenor to accompany him on his expedition. In their absence\r\nthe king himself makes love to Fidamira, who, however, escapes, and\r\nlikewise makes her way to the Shepherds' Paradise in disguise. Meanwhile,\r\nBelesa, the princess of Navarre, misliking of the proposed match with a\r\nman she has never seen, has withdrawn from her father's court to the same\r\npastoral retreat, where she has at once been elected queen of the courtly\r\ncompany. On the arrival of the prince and his friend they both fall in\r\nlove with her, but the prince's suit is seconded by the disguised\r\nFidamira, and soon takes a favourable turn. At this point the King of\r\nCastile arrives in pursuit, together with an old councillor, who proceeds\r\nto reveal the relationship of the various characters. Fidamira and Belesa,\r\nit appears, are sisters, and Agenor their brother. The marriage of the\r\nprince and Belesa is of course solemnized; the king renews his suit to\r\nFidamira, but she prefers to remain in Paradise, where she is chosen\r\nperpetual queen[329].\r\n\r\nThe plot, it will be observed, belongs entirely to the school of the\r\nHispano-French romance, and the style, intricate, involved, and conceited,\r\nin which this prose pastoral is written betrays the same origin. Moreover,\r\nas Euphuism, objectionable enough in the romance, becomes ten times more\r\nintolerable on the stage, so too with the language of the pastoral-amorous\r\ntale of courtly chivalry. There are, however, incidental passages of\r\nverse which in their own rather intricate and ergotic style are of greater\r\nmerit than the prose, though that is not saying much. The close dependence\r\nof the piece upon the chivalric tradition serves to differentiate it from\r\nthe majority of those we have to consider; while certain external\r\ncircumstances have combined to give it a fortuitous reputation.\r\n\r\nOne of Montagu's passports to fame is an allusion in Suckling's _Session\r\nof the Poets_, from which it is evident that the style of the play\r\nattracted notice of an uncomplimentary character even among the writer's\r\ncontemporaries:\r\n\r\n    Wat Montagu now stood forth to his trial,\r\n    And did not so much as suspect a denial;\r\n    But witty Apollo asked him first of all,\r\n    If he understood his own pastoral!\r\n\r\nThe _Shepherds' Paradise_ is, however, best remembered on account of\r\ncircumstances attending its performance. It was acted, as we learn from a\r\nletter of John Chamberlain's, on January 8, 1632-3, by the queen and her\r\nladies, who filled male and female parts alike. Almost simultaneously\r\nappeared Prynne's famous attack on all things connected with the stage, in\r\nwhich was one particularly scurrilous passage concerning women who\r\nappeared on the boards. As this, of course, was not the practice of the\r\npublic stage, it was evident that the author must have had some specific\r\ninstance in mind, and though it is not certain whether there was any\r\npersonal intention in the allusion, the cap was made to fit, and for the\r\nsupposed insult to the queen Prynne lost his ears.\r\n\r\nIt is presumably at this point that Randolph's _Amyntas_ should appear in\r\na chronological survey of English pastoralism.\r\n\r\nOf the 'Pastoral of Florimene,' presented at the queen's command before\r\nthe king at Whitehall, on December 21, 1635, we possess the plot only, and\r\nit is even doubtful in what language the piece was composed[330]. The\r\nsongs in the introduction and the _intermedî_ were undoubtedly in French,\r\nand the prologue by Fame in English; the rest is uncertain, but the French\r\nforms of the names, and the fact that it was represented by 'les filles\r\nfrançaises de la Reine' point in the same direction. The plot, which\r\nbelongs entirely to the court-pastoral type of the French romances, only\r\ninfluenced in the _dénoûment_ by mythological tradition, appears to be\r\noriginal in the same degree as most other pastoral inventions, that is, to\r\nexhibit fresh variations on stock situations.[331] The relation of the\r\ncharacters is involved, and not easily made out from the printed account\r\nof the piece, but the outline of the plot is as follows. The shepherdess\r\nFlorimene is loved by the Delian shepherd Anfrize, who has long been her\r\nservant, and the Arcadian stranger Filene, who in order to gain access to\r\nthe object of his devotion has disguised himself in female attire, and\r\npasses under the name of Dorine. In this disguise he is courted by\r\nFlorimene's brother, Aristee. Filene, however, was loved in Arcadia by the\r\nnymph Licoris, who has followed him disguised in shepherd's weeds.\r\nAristee, in order to sound the mind of his love, the supposed Dorine (i.e.\r\nFilene), disguises himself in his sister Florimene's dress, and in this\r\ngarb receives to his astonishment the declaration of Filene's love.\r\nAristee immediately leaves him, and turns his affections towards the\r\nfaithful Lucinde, who has long pined for his love. She, however, has now\r\nfallen in love with Lycoris in her male attire, and rejects the advances\r\nof the penitent Aristee, continuing to do so even after she has discovered\r\nher mistake. Lycoris, hearing of the disguise of Filene, seeks Florimene\r\nat the moment when she is most incensed on discovering the deception, and\r\nbegs her good offices with Filene, which are readily promised. Florimene\r\naccordingly rejects Filene when he presents himself, but he refuses to\r\nshow any favour to Lycoris until she shall have obtained his pardon from\r\nFlorimene. The latter is really in love with Filene all the time, and when\r\nLycoris comes to plead his cause, she readily grants her audience. Filene\r\nnow enters, and is about to pass his vows to Florimene when they are\r\ninterrupted by Anfrize, who in a fit of jealousy offers to kill Filene.\r\nThis attempt Florimene prevents with her sheep-hook, and declares that\r\nthey must all seek the award of Diana, by whose decision she promises to\r\nabide. The goddess then appears. Lucinde she decrees shall restore her\r\nlove to Aristee; Lycoris, she informs the company, is own sister to\r\nFilene, whose love she must therefore renounce. She then bids Anfrize and\r\nFilene plead their cause, which they do, and she declares in favour of the\r\nlatter's suit, commanding at the same time that the unsuccessful Anfrize\r\nshall wed the forlorn Lycoris. Thus all are happy, so far as having their\r\nlove affairs arranged by a third party can be supposed to make them.\r\nFlorimene, who had retired, perhaps to don her bridal robes, now returns\r\nto complete the _tableau_. 'Here the Heavens open, and there appeare many\r\ndeities, who in their songs expresse their agreements to these\r\nmarriages'--which was, no doubt, thought very satisfactory by the\r\nspectators.\r\n\r\nThe _Shepherds' Holiday_ is the most typical, as it is on the whole the\r\nmost successful, of those pastorals which exhibit the blending of the\r\nArcadian and courtly elements. It was printed in 1635, and the title-page\r\ninforms us that it was 'Written by J. R.,' initials which there is\r\nsatisfactory evidence for regarding as those of Joseph Rutter, the\r\ntranslater of Corneille's _Cid_, who appears to have been in some way\r\nattached to the households both of Sir Kenelm Digby and the Earl of\r\nDorset. The play was acted before Charles and his queen at Whitehall. The\r\nfollowing analysis will sufficiently express its nature.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the play we find Thirsis grieving for the loss of\r\nSilvia, a strange shepherdess who appeared amongst the pastoral\r\ninhabitants of Arcadia some while previously, and has recently vanished,\r\ncarried off, as her lover supposes, by a satyr. Leaving him to his lament,\r\nthe play introduces us to the huntress Nerina, courted by the rich\r\nshepherd Daphnis, whose suit is favoured by her father, and the poor swain\r\nHylas. Daphnis is in his turn loved by the nymph Dorinda. In a scene\r\nbetween Hylas and Nerina she upbraids him with having once stolen a kiss\r\nof her, and dismisses him in seeming anger; immediately he is gone,\r\nhowever, delivering herself of a soliloquy in which she confesses her\r\nlove for him, which her father's commands forbid her to reveal. Daphnis,\r\nfinding her cold to his suit, seeks the help of Alcon, who supplies him\r\nwith a magic glass, in which whoso looks shall not choose but love the\r\ngiver. In reality it is poisoned, and upon his giving it to Nerina she\r\nfaints, and in appearance dies, after obtaining as her last request her\r\nfather's favour to her love for Hylas. The scene now shifts to court.\r\nSilvia, who it appears is none other than the daughter of King Euarchus,\r\nrecounts how she had fled owing to the unwelcome suit of Cleander, the son\r\nof the old councillor Eubulus, and on account of her love of the shepherd\r\nThirsis, whom she had seen and heard at the annual show which the country\r\nfolk were wont to perform at court. After a while, however, Cleander had\r\ndiscovered her retreat and forced her to return. The shepherds are now\r\nagain about to present their rustic pageant, and she takes the opportunity\r\nof sending a private message, seeking an interview with Thirsis. Meanwhile\r\nEubulus has explained to his son Cleander how Silvia is really his own\r\ndaughter, and consequently Cleander's sister. An oracle had led the king\r\nto believe that if a son were born to him harm would ensue, and therefore\r\ncommanded that in that case the child should be destroyed. A son was born,\r\nbut Eubulus substituted his own daughter, whom he feigned dead, and\r\ncarried away the king's son with a necklace round his neck, intending to\r\ncommit him to the care of some shepherds, but being surprised by robbers\r\nfled leaving the child to its fate. Returning now to the shepherds, the\r\nplay shows us Daphnis and Alcon seeking the tomb of Nerina with a\r\nrestorative. The glass, it seems, was intentionally poisoned by Alcon, who\r\nadopted this elaborate device for placing the nymph in the power of her\r\nlover should she continue obdurate. They restore her, and finding her\r\nstill unmoved by his suit Daphnis threatens her with violence. Her cries,\r\nhowever, attract the swains, who arrive with Hylas at their head. Daphnis,\r\novercome with shame at the exposure of his villany, is glad to find a\r\nfriend in the despised Dorinda, while Nerina rewards her faithful Hylas in\r\naccordance with her father's promise. Meanwhile at court Silvia and\r\nThirsis have been surprised in their secret interview, and both doomed to\r\ndie by the anger of the king. The necklace on Thirsis' neck, however,\r\nleads to the discovery of his identity as the king's son, and all ends\r\nhappily.[332]\r\n\r\nIn point of dramatic construction the first three acts leave little to be\r\ndesired; as is so often the case, the weakness of the plot appears in the\r\nunravelling. The double solution of the two threads, neither of which is\r\nproperly subordinated, and which are wholly independent, is a serious blot\r\non the dramatic merit of the play. The courtly element, moreover, is but\r\nclumsily grafted on to the pastoral stock. Throughout the debts to\r\npredecessors, whether of language or incident, are fairly obvious. The\r\nverse in which the play is written is adequate and well sustained, and if\r\nits dependence on Daniel is evident, no less so is the advance in\r\nflexibility and expression which the language, as handled by the lesser\r\npoets, has made in the course of the twenty years or so that separate the\r\n_Shepherds' Holiday_ from _Hymen's Triumph_. Rutter's verse also displays\r\na certain nervousness of its own which is wanting in the model, though it\r\npreserves the intermixture of blank verse with irregular rimes which\r\nDaniel affected. These peculiarities may be illustrated in a passage which\r\nopens with a reminiscence of Spenser:\r\n\r\n    All as the shepherd is, such be his flocks,\r\n    So pine and languish they, as in despair\r\n    He pines and languishes; their fleecy locks\r\n    Let hang disorder'd, as their master's hair,\r\n    Since she is gone that deck'd both him and them.\r\n    And now what beauty can there be to live,\r\n    When she is lost that did all beauty give? (I. i.)\r\n\r\nAgain the opening situation recalls that of _Hymen's Triumph_, a\r\nresemblance rendered all the more striking by the retention of the actual\r\nnames, Silvia and Thirsis. In like manner the name and character of\r\nDorinda are taken from the _Pastor fido_. From the _Aminta_, of course,\r\ncomes Nerina's description of how her lover stole a kiss, though little of\r\nthe sensuous charm of the original survives; from the _Pastor fido_ her\r\nconfession of love as soon as she finds herself alone. The opening lines\r\nof this speech are, indeed, a direct translation:\r\n\r\n    Alas! my Hylas, my beloved soul,\r\n    Durst she whom thou hast call'd cruel Nerina\r\n    But speak her thoughts, thou wouldst not think her so;\r\n    To thee she is not cruel, but to herself.[333] (II. iii.)\r\n\r\nBut these borrowings are by no means unskilful, so far at least as the\r\nconstruction is concerned. The discovery by Cleander that Silvia is his\r\nown sister, and the instant effect of the discovery in destroying his\r\nlove, are of course commonplaces of the minor pastoral drama of Italy, and\r\nalso occur in some of the plays we have been examining in this chapter.\r\nVerbal reminiscences of the _Aminta_ also are scattered through the play,\r\nfor instance, the lines in which Nerina protests her hatred of all who\r\nseek to win her from her state of unfettered virginity, protestations\r\nparticularly fatuous, seeing that she is in love with Hylas throughout.\r\nHer father not unreasonably retorts:\r\n\r\n    Yes, you have made a vow, I know, which is,\r\n    Whilst you are young, you will have all the youth\r\n    To follow you with lies and flatteries.\r\n    Fool, they'll deceive you; when this colour fades,\r\n    Which will not always last, and you go crooked,\r\n    As if you sought your beauty, lost i' th' ground,\r\n    Then they will laugh at you! (II. v.)\r\n\r\nWith which he goes off to attend to the shearing of his sheep, one of\r\nthose wholly unnecessary operations which the less skilful pastoralists\r\nmake it a virtue to thrust upon our attention. The scene between Nerina,\r\nDaphnis, and Dorinda, a sort of three-cornered love-suit, may possibly\r\nhave suggested to Cowley the best scene in the play which next claims our\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nCowley's _Love's Riddle_, published in 1638, but written two or three\r\nyears earlier, is the work of a boy of sixteen, and though it serves amply\r\nto prove the precocity of its author, it does not therefore follow that it\r\nis itself possessed of any conspicuous merit. To find in it passages of\r\ngenuine observation and love of nature, as one of Cowley's critics\r\nprofesses to do, is unpardonably partial; to grumble with another at not\r\nfinding them is futile; even with a third to see in the piece 'a boy's\r\nconception of Sicilian life' is, to say the least, unnecessary. Cowley\r\nhad, indeed, a great deal too much of 'the precocious humour of the\r\nworld-wise boy' to put forward his play as anything of the kind; he was\r\nperfectly aware that it was an absolutely unreal fantasy, based entirely\r\non convention and imitation, the sole merit of which was the more or less\r\nclever manner in which borrowing, reminiscence, and tradition were\r\ninterwoven and combined. The plot is a mixture of the pastoral and\r\ncourtly, or at least aristocratic, types, not uninfluenced by the rustic\r\nor comic, which, like the chivalric, is no doubt of Sidneian origin.\r\n\r\nCalidora, the daughter of noble parents in Sicily, retires among the\r\nshepherd folk disguised in man's apparel, in order, as we only learn at\r\nthe end of the play, to escape from the violence of Aphron, one of her\r\nsuitors. Her other suitor, Philistus, as well as her brother Florellus and\r\nPhilistus' sister Clariana, all set off in search of her, while Aphron,\r\nfinding her fled from his pursuit, wanders aimlessly about, having lost\r\nhis reason. Thus the courtly characters are all brought in contact with\r\nthe country swains, among whom Palaemon courts the disdainful Hylace,\r\ndaughter of the crabbed Melarnus and the old hag Truga. Other pastoral\r\ncharacters are old Aegon and his supposed daughter Bellula, and Alupis,\r\nwho fills at once the rôles of the 'merry' shepherd and the 'wise.' On\r\nCallidora's appearance in boy's attire among the shepherd folk Hylace and\r\nBellula alike fall in love with her, while in his search for his sister\r\nFlorellus falls in love with Bellula. This gives occasion for a scene of\r\nsome merit between Callidora, Bellula, and Florellus, in which, after\r\nvainly disputing of their loves, they form a sort of triple alliance under\r\nthe name of Love's Riddle. A similar scene could obviously be worked with\r\nCallidora, Hylace, and Palaemon, and it is perhaps to Cowley's credit that\r\nhe has avoided the obvious parallelism. Meanwhile Clariana has met the mad\r\nAphron without recognizing him, and taking pity on his state brings him\r\nhome to cure him, an attempt in which she is successful. He rewards her by\r\ntransferring to her his somewhat questionable attentions. Also Alupis,\r\nworking on Truga, has tricked her into seeking the marriage of Hylace and\r\nPalaemon; a plan, however, which is upset by Hylace and Melarnus.\r\nFlorellus in the meantime becomes impatient at finding a rival in\r\nBellula's love, and seeks a duel with Callidora. She apparently fails to\r\nrecognize her brother, and is forced to fight. They are separated by\r\nPhilistus and Bellula. The two girls faint, and are carried by their\r\nlovers into the house where Clariana is nursing Aphron. Callidora's\r\nidentity is discovered, and her parents arrive upon the scene. Bellula is\r\nfound to be, not, as was supposed, Aegon's daughter, but sister to Aphron,\r\nstolen by pirates in childhood. Aegon makes Palaemon his heir, thereby\r\nremoving Melarnus' objection to his suit to Hylace, while the latter and\r\nBellula, discovering the hopelessness of their love for Callidora, consent\r\nto reward their respective lovers. Aphron, cured and forgiven, is accepted\r\nby Clariana, and thus, all bars removed, the happiness of the four pairs\r\nis secured.\r\n\r\nThere has been a tendency to exaggerate the merits of this plot. Cowley\r\nshows, indeed, some skill in the ravelling and in the handling of\r\nindividual scenes, but in the unravelling he is far from happy, and there\r\nis often an utter lack of motive about his characters. Where the whole\r\nconstruction, indeed, depends upon no inner necessity, the various\r\nthreads, as soon as their interweaving ceases to be necessary to the plot,\r\nfall apart of themselves, without any _dénoûment_, strictly speaking, at\r\nall. Thus Cowley's play has the characteristic faults of immature work,\r\nabsence of rational characterization, and want of logical construction.\r\n\r\nThe verse, though well sustained, is on a singularly tedious level of\r\nmediocrity, while the lyrics introduced are all alike considerably below\r\nthe general level. There are seldom more than a few lines together which\r\npossess any distinguishing merit, such as an indulgent editor has found\r\nin Bellula's exclamation when she first falls in love with Callidora:\r\n\r\n    How red his cheekes are! so our garden apples\r\n    Looke on that side where the hot Sun salutes them; (I. ii.)\r\n\r\nor in the lines with which Callidora prepares to meet death from her\r\nbrother's sword:\r\n\r\n    As sick men doe their beds, so have I yet\r\n    Injoy'd my selfe, with little rest, much trouble:\r\n    I have beene made the Ball of Love and Fortune,\r\n    And am almost worne out with often playing;\r\n    And therefore I would entertaine my death\r\n    As some good friend whose comming I expected. (V. iii.)\r\n\r\nMr. Gosse once expressed the opinion that Cowley's play is 'a distinct\r\nfollowing without imitation of _The Jealous Lovers_ of Thomas Randolph.'\r\nExactly what was meant by this phrase it is difficult to tell, but if it\r\nwas intended to imply any resemblance between the two pieces its\r\napplication is confined to the character of a woman to whom age has not\r\ntaught continence, and an incidental hit at the jargon of\r\nastrologers.[334] That Cowley had read _The Jealous Lovers_, published in\r\n1633, is by no means unlikely, for he was certainly acquainted with the\r\nyet unpublished _Amyntas_. This he may perhaps have seen when it was\r\nperformed at Whitehall, and he imitated several passages of it in his own\r\nWestminster play. The most important point of connexion is the madness of\r\nAphron, which is modelled with some closeness on that of Amyntas. Actual\r\nverbal reminiscences are not common, but there can, I think, be little\r\ndoubt that the schoolboy has been imitating the half-grotesque,\r\nhalf-poetic fantasies of the university wit, though he has wholly failed\r\nto achieve his pathos. Again, the speech of Florellus at the opening of\r\nAct III recalls the return both of Corymbus and of Claius in _Amyntas_,\r\nwhile Cowley is much more likely to have been influenced to lay the scene\r\nof his play in Sicily by Randolph's example than by his reading of\r\nTheocritus, whose influence, if it exists, is of the slightest. Emulation,\r\nrather than imitation, was Cowley's attitude towards his predecessor, and\r\nhis means are not always happy. Thus, though the humours of Truga may have\r\nbeen suggested by the character of Dipsa in the _Jealous Lovers_, she is\r\nprobably introduced into Cowley's play as the counterpart of Dorylas in\r\n_Amyntas_. Randolph trod on thin ice in some of the speeches of the\r\nliquorish wag, whose 'years are yet uncapable of love,' but censure will\r\nnot stick to the witty knave. On the other hand, Cowley's portrait of\r\nincontinent age in Truga fails wholly of being comic, and appears all the\r\nloathlier for the fact that the author himself was still a mere\r\nschoolboy--though this is, indeed, his best excuse. Other parallels could\r\nbe pointed out, but it would be superfluous; convention and petty theft\r\nare the warp and woof of the piece. The satire, which has met with some\r\npraise, is, of course, staled by a hundred poets of the pastoral vein. The\r\nposition of Callidora, loved in her disguise by the two girls, recalls\r\nthat of many pastoral heroines before and since Daniel's Silvia,\r\nparticularly perhaps of the courtly Rosalind loved by the Arcadian Phoebe.\r\nThe chivalric admixture is, as usual, traceable to Sidney, and the duel\r\nfinds of course an obvious parallel in _Twelfth Night_. The discovery of\r\nBellula's identity recalls more particularly, perhaps, that of Chloe's in\r\nLongus' romance, or may possibly indicate an acquaintance with Bonarelli's\r\n_Filli di Sciro_, which might also be traced in the attribution to\r\ncentaurs of the character long identified with satyrs in pastoral\r\ntradition.\r\n\r\nIt is a coincidence, but one significant of the nature of the pastoral\r\ntradition, if such it can be called, that had sprung up on the English\r\nstage, that the next play to claim our notice is again the work of a\r\nschoolboy. _Love in its Extasy_, described on the title-page as 'a kind of\r\nRoyall Pastorall,' was written, at the age of seventeen, by a student of\r\nEton College, whom it has been customary to identify with one William\r\nPeaps.[335] The date of composition is said in the stationer's preface to\r\nhave preceded by many years that of publication, 1649, we may perhaps\r\nregard the piece as more or less contemporary with Cowley's juvenile\r\neffort. There is, it is true, one passage,[336] treating of tyrants and\r\nrevolutions, which is such as a moderate supporter of 'divine right' might\r\nhave been expected to pen in the later days of the civil war; the\r\npublisher's words, however, are unequivocal, and can hardly refer to a\r\nperiod after 1642.\r\n\r\n_Love in its Extasy_ itself cannot, without some straining of the term, be\r\ncalled a pastoral, though there are certain links serving to connect it\r\nwith pastoral tradition. The only excuse, beyond that afforded by the\r\ntitle-page, for including it in the present category is that several of\r\nthe characters, finding it for various reasons inconvenient to appear in\r\ntheir own shapes, take upon themselves a pastoral disguise; but there is\r\nno hint of any pastoral background to the action, not even the atmosphere\r\nof a rural academy as in Montagu's play. The whole piece, however, is in\r\nthe style of the Hispano-French romance, in which pastoral or\r\npseudo-pastoral plays so large a part. To enter into the plot in detail is\r\nfor our present purpose unnecessary. It is apparently original, and,\r\nconsidered as a romance, would do no small credit to its youthful author.\r\nAn exiled king and his lady-love assume the sheep-hook, as do also two\r\nprinces and the mistress of one of them, the mistress of the other\r\nappearing in the disguise of a boy. Disguisings, potions, feigned deaths,\r\nand recognitions, or rather revelations of identity, form the staple\r\nelements of the plot. The play is long, the stage crowded, the plot\r\nintricate and elaborated with a superabundance of incident; but it must be\r\nadmitted that the attention is held and the interest sustained, even to a\r\nwearisome degree, throughout; that the characters are individualized, and\r\nthe action clear. These are no small merits, as any one whose fortune it\r\nhas been to wade through any considerable portion of the minor drama will\r\nbe ready to acknowledge; while the defects of the piece are those commonly\r\nincident to immature work. The most conspicuous are the want of one\r\nprominent interest, and the lack of definite climax; at least four equally\r\nimportant threads are kept running through the play, and the dramatic\r\ntension is at an almost constant pitch throughout. These characteristics\r\nare those of the narrative romance and of the novel of adventure\r\nrespectively, and are fatal to the success of the dramatic form.\r\n\r\nThe verse is in a way peculiar. It is intended as blank verse, and it is\r\ntrue that the licences taken do not exceed those commonly allowed by the\r\npractice of dramatists such as Fletcher, but here they are wholly\r\nunregulated by any natural feeling for metre or rhythm, and the resuit can\r\nhardly be called pleasing. On the other hand, there are a few happy lines,\r\nas where a lover bids his penitent mistress\r\n\r\n                            Go,\r\n    Knock at Repentance gate, one tear of thine\r\n    Will easily compell an entrance. (V. ii.)\r\n\r\nThere are also some passages of forcible vigour, not always subject to\r\ndramatic propriety. Nevertheless, the qualities of life and brightness\r\ndisplayed are sufficient to induce a belief that had the author begun\r\nwriting at a moment more propitious than the eve of the civil war, and\r\npursued his career on the practical London stage, our drama might have\r\nbeen the richer by, say, a second Shirley, an addition which those who\r\nknow that writer best will probably rate most highly. In any case the\r\ncomposition must, I think, be held to surpass in genuine qualities\r\nCowley's flashy precocity.\r\n\r\nThis will be the most convenient place to mention an anonymous and undated\r\nplay entitled _Love's Victory_, extracts from a manuscript of which were\r\nprinted in 1853.[337] The style of the piece is not much guide as to the\r\ndate, but the play does not appear to be early, in spite of the somewhat\r\narchaic spelling. It is in rime; mostly decasyllabic couplets, but with\r\nfree intermixture of alternative rime and frequent lyrical passages. It is\r\nof course difficult to gather much of the plot from the printed extracts,\r\nbut so far as it is possible to judge the play appears to have been a\r\npure pastoral, with Venus and Cupid introduced in the _finale_, while the\r\nsituations and characters are those habitual to pastorals, including the\r\nquite superfluous protesting of a not very prepossessing chastity. The\r\nonly more original trait is the scene in which the nymphs meet and relate\r\ntheir love adventures, a rather awkward device for carrying on the\r\ninvolution of the plot. There is a certain ease in the verse, but on the\r\nwhole the poetic merit is small.[338]\r\n\r\nWe have now passed in review all the regular pastoral plays lying within\r\nour scope. There remain a number of shorter compositions of a similar or\r\nat least analogous nature, as well as a good many masques and other pieces\r\nin which the pastoral element is more or less dominant. These it will for\r\nour present purpose be convenient to consider in connexion with each\r\nother, and without troubling ourselves too much concerning such nice\r\ndifferences of form as may be found to exist among them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII.\r\n\r\nMasques and General Influence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the English masque offers a very interesting study in what\r\nmay be called literary morphology. Under the influence of the stage the\r\nearly disguisings and spectacular dances developed into a semi-dramatic\r\nkind, intermediate between the literary drama and mere scenic displays,\r\nand recognized as possessing a definite nature and proper limitations of\r\nits own. To this highly individualized form of art the term masque may\r\noften with convenience and propriety be restricted, but all such rigid and\r\nexclusive definitions have this disadvantage, that they tend to make lines\r\nof division appear clearer and more logically convincing than they in fact\r\nusually are, and further that they tempt us to neglect the often numerous\r\nand closely allied specimens which cannot be brought to accommodate\r\nthemselves to the abstract type. Those writers who deny that _Comus_ is a\r\nmasque are entirely justified from their point of view; it is a question\r\nof classification, and the classification which it is convenient to adopt\r\nmay vary according to the nature of the investigation in hand. It must\r\nnot, therefore, be thought that I place myself in antagonism to critics\r\nsuch as Dr. Brotanek for example, if I give to the term masque its widest\r\npossible signification as including not only the regular and highly\r\ndeveloped compositions of the Jonsonian type, but also mere pageants on\r\nthe one hand, and what may be called miniature plays on the other; all\r\ndramatic or semi-dramatic pieces, in short, which it is undesirable or\r\ninconvenient to treat along with the regular productions. Approaching the\r\nquestion as we do, not from the point of view of the evolution of a\r\nparticular literary form, but from that of a persistent ideal and\r\nquasi-philosophical tradition, which manifests itself in all manner of\r\nforms and fashions, we have a perfect right to adopt whatever\r\nclassification suits our purpose best, provided always that we have a\r\nclear notion what it is we are discussing. I propose, therefore, to treat\r\nin chronological order all those pieces which, owing to their less fully\r\ndeveloped dramatic form, were omitted from the previous chapter. Something\r\nno doubt has been sacrificed by thus separating the regular dramas from\r\nthe slighter and more occasional compositions, for in the earlier times\r\nespecially these latter serve to fill considerable gaps in the sequence,\r\nand must have had a powerful influence in fashioning that pastoral\r\ntradition to which the pieces we have already considered belong.\r\n\r\nThe connexion of the pastoral with the masque began very early, and may\r\nwell have been more constant than we should be tempted to suppose from the\r\nisolated examples that remain. The union was a natural one, for the\r\npastoral, whether in its Arcadian or chivalric guise, was well suited to\r\nsupply the framework for graceful poetry and elaborate dances alike, while\r\nthe rustic and burlesque elements were equally capable of furnishing\r\nmatter for the antimasque, when the form had reached that stage of\r\nstructural elaboration. The allusive and allegorical features which had\r\nlong been traditional in the pastoral likewise suited the topical and\r\noccasional nature of the masque. The connexion, however, with the stricter\r\nforms at least, was never very close, the tendency on the part of the\r\npastoral to confine itself to a mere external formalism being even more\r\nnoticeable here than in the case of the regular drama.\r\n\r\nThe earliest instance of this connexion of which we have notice is one of\r\ninterest in English history. It is none other than the masquerade in which\r\nHenry appeared disguised as a shepherd at Wolsey's feast, which, according\r\nto Shakespeare, was the occasion of his first meeting with Anne Boleyn.\r\nThe disguising is attested by the authority of Cavendish and Hall, but it\r\nis clear that the pastoral element was confined to the garb, there being\r\nno indication of anything of the nature of a literary presentation.\r\n\r\nThe first literary specimen of the kind does not appear till near the\r\nmiddle of Elizabeth's reign, and even then there is barely an excuse for\r\nclassing it as pastoral. The composition in question is the slight\r\nentertainment, to which the name of _The Lady of May_ has been given by\r\nmodern critics, composed by Sidney for presentation before Elizabeth\r\nduring her visit to Leicester at Wanstead, in May, 1578. It appears to\r\nhave been his earliest work. Though not itself a masque in the strict\r\nsense of the word in which we have learnt to use it, the piece contains\r\nthe undeveloped germs of most of the later characteristics of the kind.\r\nThe Queen in her walks through the grounds came to a spot where the\r\nMay-Lady was being courted by a shepherd and a 'foster,' hotly contending\r\nfor the prize. The strife was stayed, and, the deserts of either party\r\nbeing duly set forth, the Lady referred the choice to the Queen, who\r\ndecided in favour of the pastoral suitor. A song and music ended the show.\r\nA strongly rustic element is sustained by the Lady's mother and the old\r\nshepherd Dorcas, while a touch of broad burlesque is introduced in the\r\ncharacter of the pedagogue Rombus, who speaks in a style really little\r\nmore extravagant than that of Sidney's own _Arcadia_. As in the romance,\r\nat the end of which the piece was first printed in 1598, the occasional\r\nsongs are of small merit.\r\n\r\nThe spring-like freshness that characterizes so much of Peele's best work\r\nbreathes deliciously through the polite convention of the _Descensus\r\nAstraeae_, the 'Pageant, borne before M. William Web, Lord Maior of the\r\nCitie of London on the day he tooke his oath; beeing the 29. of October.\r\n1591.' The conceit is graceful in itself, and significant of the sentiment\r\nof contemporary London. Astraea, bearing her sheep-hook as a sort of\r\npastoral sceptre, typified the Queen, and passed on in her triumphal car\r\nwith the words:\r\n\r\n    Feed on, my flock, among the gladsome green,\r\n      Where heavenly nectar flows above the banks;\r\n    Such pastures are not common to be seen:\r\n      Pay to immortal Jove immortal thanks,\r\n    For what is good fro heaven's high throne doth fall;\r\n    And heaven's great architect be praised for all[339].\r\n\r\nIn her praise the graces, the virtues, and a champion utter appropriate\r\nspeeches, whilst Superstition, a friar, and Ignorance, a priest, together\r\nwith other malcontents, shrink back abashed before her onward march.\r\n\r\nThe following year appeared the anonymous 'Speeches delivered to her\r\nMajestie this last progresse, at the Right Honorable the Lady Russels, at\r\nBissam, the Right Honorable the Lorde Chandos, at Sudley, at the Right\r\nHonorable the Lord Norris, at Ricorte.' This piece being very\r\ncharacteristic of a certain sort of courtly shows, and itself possessing\r\nrather greater intrinsic interest than is to be found in most of the\r\ncompositions we shall have to examine, may lay claim to a somewhat more\r\ndetailed discussion. As the Queen approached through the woods towards\r\nBisham, cornets were heard to sound, and presently there appeared a wild\r\nman who began his speech thus:\r\n\r\n  I followed this sounde, as enchanted; neither knowing the reason why,\r\n  nor how to bee ridde of it: unusuall to these Woods, and, I feare, to\r\n  our gods prodigious. Sylvanus whom I honour, is runne into a Cave: Pan,\r\n  whom I envye, courting of the Shepheardesse. Envie I thee Pan? No, pitty\r\n  thee; an eie-sore to chast Nymphes, yet still importunate. Honour thee\r\n  Sylvanus? No, contemne thee; fearefull of Musicke in the Woods, yet\r\n  counted the god of the Woods.\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds to welcome the royal visitor. Further on 'At the middle\r\nof the Hill sate Pan, and two Virgins keeping sheepe, and sowing in their\r\nSamplers.' Pan courts the shepherdesses, who mock him, and finally all\r\njoin in welcome of the Queen. 'At the bottome of the hill,' we read\r\nfurther, 'entring into the hous, Ceres with her Nymphes in an harvest\r\nCart, meete her Majesty, having a Crowne of wheat-ears with a Jewell.'\r\nCeres sings:\r\n\r\n    Swel Ceres now, for other Gods are shrinking;\r\n         Pomona pineth,\r\n             Fruitlesse her tree;\r\n         Fair Phoebus shineth\r\n             Onely on mee.\r\n    Conceit doth make me smile whilst I am thinking,...\r\n    All other Gods of power bereven,\r\n    Ceres only Queene of heaven.\r\n\r\n    With Robes and flowers let me be dressed;\r\n            Cynthia that shineth\r\n              Is not so cleare,\r\n            Cynthia declineth\r\n              When I appeere,\r\n    Yet in this Ile shee raignes as blessed, ...\r\n         And in my eares still fonde Fame whispers,\r\n         Cynthia shalbe Ceres Mistres.\r\n\r\nShe then proceeds to welcome the Queen as 'Greater then Ceres.' At Sudely\r\nCastle her Majesty was received by an old shepherd with a long speech;\r\nwhereafter we read: 'Sunday, Apollo running after Daphne,' a show\r\naccompanied by a speech from another shepherd, at the end whereof, the\r\nmetamorphosis safely accomplished, 'her Majesty sawe Apollo with the tree,\r\nhaving on one side one that sung, on the other one that plaide.'\r\n\r\n    Sing you, plaie you, but sing and play my truth,\r\n    This tree my Lute, these sighes my notes of ruth:\r\n    The Lawrell leafe for ever shall bee greene,\r\n    And chastety shalbe Apolloes Queene.\r\n    If gods maye dye, here shall my tombe be plaste,\r\n    And this engraven, 'Fonde Phoebus, Daphne chaste.'\r\n\r\n'The song ended, the tree rived, and Daphne issued out, Apollo ranne\r\nafter, with these words:'\r\n\r\n    Faire Daphne staye, too chaste because too faire,\r\n      Yet fairer in mine eies, because so chaste,\r\n    And yet because so chaste, must I despaire?\r\n      And to despaire, I yeelded have at last.\r\n\r\n'Daphne running to her Majestie uttered this:'\r\n\r\n    I stay, for whether should chastety fly for succour, but to the Queene\r\n    of chastety, &c.\r\n\r\na speech which can without loss be left to the imagination of the reader.\r\nThe third day's show was prevented by bad weather: it was designed thus.\r\nSummoned by one clad in sheep-skins, the Queen was to be led to where the\r\nshepherds of Cotswold were engaged in choosing a king and queen of the\r\nfeast by the simple divination of a bean and a pea concealed in a cake.\r\nAfter a while spying her Majesty, the whole company should have joined in\r\na welcome. The rest of the show is in no wise pastoral. The very marked\r\nEuphuism of the prose portions, combined with some lyrical merit, makes\r\nthe composition worth notice, and has led to its ascription to the pen of\r\nLyly himself. It was, of course, composed and presented for her Majesty's\r\ndelectation at a time when Lyly's plays were the delight of the court; but\r\nhowever grateful we may feel to Mr. Bond for having made this and other\r\nsimilar pieces accessible in his edition of the poet, we need not\r\nnecessarily accept his view of the authorship.[340]\r\n\r\nTo the end of the sixteenth century belong undoubtedly many of the pieces\r\nprinted for the first time in 1637 in Thomas Heywood's volume of\r\n_Dialogues and Dramas_.[341] The only one of these that can really be\r\nstyled pastoral is a slight composition entitled _Amphrissa, or the\r\nForsaken Shepherdess_. Two shepherdesses, Pelopaea and Alope, meet and\r\nfall to discoursing of love and inconstancy, and cite incidentally the\r\nunhappy case of Amphrissa, who at that moment appears in person and joins\r\nin the conversation. The nymphs undertake her cure, and give her much wise\r\ncounsel while they crown her with willow. Then there appears upon the\r\nscene the huntress queen of Arcadia herself, attended by her nymphs,\r\nvirgin Diana, before whom the country maidens bow in awe. She graciously\r\nraises them, and the slight piece ends with dance and song.\r\n\r\nIn this drama or dialogue or masque, or whatever it may be most\r\nappropriately called, we see all plot disappear, and the interest\r\nconcentrate itself in the dialogue, which, for all that it is written in\r\nblank verse of some rhythmical merit, reveals a strong inclination towards\r\nEuphuism. Thus we read of men how\r\n\r\n      like as the Chamelions change themselves\r\n    Into all perfect colours saving white;\r\n    So they can to all humors frame their speech,\r\n    Save only to prove honest;\r\n\r\nor else how\r\n\r\n      light minds are catcht with little things,\r\n    And Phancie smels to Fennell.\r\n\r\nNor are other and more marked traces of Lyly's influence wanting: witness\r\nthe following passage, which is a mere metrical paraphrase of a speech in\r\nthe _Gallathea_ already quoted (p. 227):\r\n\r\n    You have an heate, on which a coldnesse waits,\r\n    A paine that is endur'd with pleasantnesse,\r\n    And makes those sweets you eat have bitter taste:\r\n    It puts eies in your thoughts, eares in your heart:\r\n    'Twas by desire first bred, by delight nurst,\r\n    And hath of late been wean'd by jelousie.\r\n\r\nCertain speeches of a sententious nature, on the other hand, remind us\r\nrather of Daniel and the sonneteers:\r\n\r\n    To wish the best, to thinke upon the worst,\r\n    And all contingents brooke with patience,\r\n    Is a most soveraigne medicine.\r\n\r\nAll these characteristics point to an early date, and Mr. Fleay, who\r\nregards the piece as forming part of the _Five Plays in One_, acted at the\r\nRose in April, 1597, may very likely be right. Of the other pieces printed\r\nin the same volume, a few only show any trace of pastoral blending with\r\nthe general mythological colouring. Perhaps the most that can be said is\r\nthat the nymphs are already familiar to us from the pastoral tradition,\r\nand must have been scarcely less so to a contemporary audience, fresh from\r\nthe work of Peele and Lyly. In _Jupiter and Io_, which perhaps made part\r\nof the same performance as _Amphrissa_, Mercury disguises himself as a\r\nshepherd, in order to cut off the head of Argus. This he did to such good\r\npurpose that record of the trunkless member remains unto this day in the\r\ninventories of the Lord Admiral's company. Another of these pieces, the\r\ncharacter of which can be easily imagined from its title, _Apollo and\r\nDaphne_, ends with a song, which may owe something to the traditions of\r\nthe mythological pastoral:\r\n\r\n      Howsoe're the Minutes go,\r\n      Run the heures or swift or slow:\r\n      Seem the Months or short or long,\r\n      Passe the seasons right or wrong:\r\n    All we sing that Phoebus follow,\r\n    _Semel in anno ridet Apollo_.\r\n\r\n      Early fall the Spring or not,\r\n      Prove the Summer cold or hot:\r\n      Autumne be it faire or foule,\r\n      Let the Winter smile or skowle:\r\n    Still we sing, that Phoebus follow,\r\n    _Semel in anno ridet Apollo_.\r\n\r\nPassing on to the seventeenth century, the first piece that demands\r\nattention is the St. John's Twelfth Night entertainment, _Narcissus_,\r\nperformed at Oxford in 1602. If its pastoral quality is somewhat\r\nevanescent, there is another point of view from which the piece has a good\r\ndeal of interest. It is, namely, a burlesque production of the nature of\r\nthe Pyramus and Thisbe interlude in the _Midsummer Night's Dream_, and\r\nflavoured with something of the comic rusticity of Greene's Carmela\r\neclogue in _Menaphon_. It is needless here to summarize the plot of the\r\n'merriment' which the ingenious author, no doubt a student of St. John's,\r\nevolved from Ovid's account in the third book of the _Metamorphoses_, and\r\nwhich runs to the respectable length of some eight hundred lines.[342] I\r\nmay be allowed, however, to note that echo verses, suggested by Ovid, are\r\nintroduced and handled with more than usual ingenuity; and further to\r\nquote two characteristic passages. In one of these the nymphs Florida and\r\nClois court the affections of the loveless hero.\r\n\r\n    _Florida._ Shine thou on mee, sweet plannet, bee soe good\r\n    As with thy fiery beames to warme my bloud ...\r\n\r\n    _Narcissus._ To speak the truth, faire maid, if you will have us,\r\n    O Oedipus I am not, I am Davus.\r\n\r\n    _Clois._ Good Master Davis, bee not so discourteous\r\n    As not to heare a maidens plaint for vertuous.\r\n\r\n    _Nar._ Speake on a Gods name, so love bee not the theame.\r\n\r\n    _Flo._ O, whiter then a dish of clowted creame,\r\n    Speake not of love? How can I overskippe\r\n    To speake of love to such a cherrye lippe?\r\n\r\n    _Nar._ It would beseeme a maidens slender vastitye\r\n    Never to speake of any thinge but chastitye.\r\n\r\n    _Flo._ As true as Helen was to Menela\r\n    So true to thee will be thy Florida.\r\n\r\n    _Clo._ As was to trusty Pyramus truest Thisbee\r\n    So true to you will ever thy sweete Clois bee.\r\n\r\n    _Flo._ O doe not stay a moment nor a minute,\r\n    Love is a puddle, I am ore shooes in it.\r\n\r\n    _Clo._ Doe not delay us halfe a minutes mountenance\r\n    That ar in love, in love with thy sweet countenance.\r\n\r\n    _Nar._ Then take my dole although I deale my alms ill,\r\n    Narcissus cannot love with any damzell;\r\n    Although, for most part, men to love encline all,\r\n    I will not, I, this is your answere finall.\r\n\r\nWe are here, it is true, as far as ever from the delicate rusticity of\r\nLorenzo de' Medici, and not particularly near to the humour of the\r\nAthenian rustics, but for burlesque it is passably amusing. The _Midsummer\r\nNight's Dream_ had appeared possibly a decade earlier, and the audience in\r\nthe college hall at Oxford can hardly but have been reminded of Wall and\r\nMoonshine as they listened to the speech by one who enters carrying 'a\r\nbuckett and boughes and grasse.'\r\n\r\n    A well there was withouten mudd,\r\n    Of silver hue, with waters cleare,\r\n    Whome neither sheep that chawe the cudd,\r\n    Shepheards nor goates came ever neare;\r\n    Whome, truth to say, nor beast nor bird,\r\n    Nor windfalls yet from trees had stirrde.\r\n                        [_He strawes the grasse about the buckett._\r\n    And round about it there was grasse,\r\n    As learned lines of poets showe,\r\n    Which next by water nourisht was;            [_Sprinkle water._\r\n    Neere to it too a wood did growe,       _[Sets down the bowes._\r\n    To keep the place, as well I wott,\r\n    With too much sunne from being hott.\r\n    And thus least you should have mistooke it,\r\n    The truth of all I to you tell:\r\n    Suppose you the well had a buckett,\r\n    And so the buckett stands for the well;\r\n    And 'tis, least you should counte mee for a sot O,\r\n    A very pretty figure cald _pars pro toto_.\r\n\r\nThe first strict masque of a pastoral character that we meet with is that\r\nof Juno and Iris, with the dance of nymphs and the 'sunburnt sicklemen, of\r\nAugust weary,' introduced by Shakespeare into the _Tempest_; but this must\r\nnot be taken as altogether typical of the independent productions of the\r\ntime. The masques introduced into plays were necessarily, for the most\r\npart, of a slighter and less elaborate character than those performed at\r\ncourt, or for the entertainment of persons of rank. This is more\r\nparticularly the case with the serions portions of the masques, since the\r\nactors, who were engaged for the performance of the antimasques in court\r\nrevels, frequently transferred their parts bodily on to the public boards.\r\nThus, in the entertainment in the _Winters Tale_, in which shepherds also\r\nappear, the main feature was a dance of satyrs, which was no doubt\r\nborrowed from Jonson's _Masque of Oberon_.[343] The _Tempest_ masque,\r\nhowever, is of the simpler type, without antimasque. At Juno's command\r\nIris summons Ceres, and the goddesses together bestow their blessing on\r\nthe young lovers. Then at Iris' call come the naiads and the reapers for\r\nthe dance. The date of the play may be taken as late in 1610, or early the\r\nnext year, a time at which the popularity of the masque was reaching its\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nAlthough the mythological element is everywhere prominent, the pastoral is\r\ncomparatively of rare occurrence in the regular masque literature of the\r\nseventeenth century. This, considering the adaptability and natural\r\nsuitability of the form, is rather surprising. Probably the masque as it\r\nevolved itself at the court of James needed a subject possessing a\r\ntraditional story, or at least fixed and known conditions of a kind which\r\nthe pastoral was unable to supply. Be this as it may, on one occasion\r\nonly did Jonson make extended use of the kind, namely, in the masque which\r\nin the folio of 1640 appears with the heading 'Pans Anniversarie; or, The\r\nShepherds Holy-day. The Scene Arcadia. As it was presented at Court before\r\nKing James. 1625. The Inventors, Inigo Jones, Ben. Johnson[344].' Even\r\nhere, however, we learn little concerning the condition of pastoralism in\r\ngeneral, from the highly specialized form employed to a specific purpose.\r\nAs in all the regular masques of the Jonsonian type the characters and\r\nsituations exist solely for the opportunities they afford for dance and\r\nsong. Shepherds and nymphs constitute the personae of the masque proper,\r\nwhile those of the antimasque are supplied by a band of Bocotian clowns,\r\nwho come to challenge the Arcadians to the dance. Some of the songs are\r\nvery graceful, suggesting at times reminiscences of Spenser, at others\r\nparallels to Ben's own _Sad Shepherd_, but the piece does not possess\r\neither sufficient importance or interest to justify our lingering over it.\r\nOutside this piece the nearest approach to pastoral characters to be found\r\nin Jonson's masques are, perhaps, the satyr and Queen Mab in the fairy\r\nentertainment at Althorp in 1603, Silenus and the satyrs in _Oberon_ in\r\n1611, and Zephyrus, Spring, and the Fountains and Rivers in _Chloridia_ in\r\n1631.\r\n\r\nDuring James I's reign pastoral shows of a sort no doubt became frequent.\r\nWhile in some cases which remain to be noticed they reached the\r\nelaboration of small plays, in others they probably remained simple\r\naffairs enough. We get an interesting glimpse of the conditions of\r\nproduction in a note of John Aubrey's.[345] 'In tempore Jacobi,' he\r\nwrites, 'one Mr. George Ferraby was parson of Bishops Cannings in Wilts:\r\nan excellent musitian, and no ill poet. When queen Anne came to Bathe, her\r\nway lay to traverse the famous Wensdyke, which runnes through his parish.\r\nHe made severall of his neighbours, good musitians, to play with him in\r\nconsort, and to sing. Against her majestie's comeing, he made a pleasant\r\npastorall, and gave her an entertaynment with his fellow songsters in\r\nshepherds' weeds and bagpipes, he himself like an old bard. After that\r\nwind musique was over, they sang their pastorall eglogues.' This was in\r\n1613; Ferraby or Ferebe later became chaplain to the king.\r\n\r\nThe more elaborate pieces were usually written for performance at schools\r\nor colleges. Such a piece is Tatham's _Love Crowns the End_, composed for\r\nthe scholars of Bingham in Nottinghamshire in 1633, and printed in his\r\n_Fancy's Theatre_ in 1640. Small literary interest attaches to the play,\r\nwhich is equally slight and ill constructed, but is perhaps not\r\nunrepresentative of its class. In spite of its very modest dimensions it\r\npossesses a full romantic-pastoral plot, with the resuit that it is at\r\ntimes almost unintelligible, owing to the want of space in which to\r\ndevelop in an adequate and dramatic manner the motives and situations. The\r\nbewildering rapidity with which character succeeds character upon the\r\nstage must have made the representation almost impossible to follow, while\r\nthe reading of the piece is not a little complicated by the confusion in\r\nwhich the stage directions remain in the only modern edition.[346] Some\r\nnotion of the complexity of the plot may be gathered from the following\r\naccount. Cliton, having in a fit of jealousy sought to kill his love\r\nFlorida, is found wandering in the woods by Alexis, who receives his\r\nconfession and shows him the way to repentance. Florida, moreover, has\r\nbeen found and healed by the wise shepherdess Claudia, and is living in\r\nretirement. Meanwhile Cloe (a name which it appears from the rimes that\r\nthe author pronounced Cloi) is saved by Lysander from the pursuit of a\r\nLustful Shepherd, in consequence of which she transfers to him the\r\naffection she previously bore to her lover Daphnes. Next Leon and his\r\ndaughter Gloriana appear, together with the swain Francisco, to whom\r\nagainst her will the maiden is apparently betrothed. They all go off to\r\nview the games in which Lysander, whose heart is also fixed on Gloriana,\r\nproves victor. His refusal to entertain the affection of Cloe drives her\r\nto a state of distraction, in which the nymphs of the woods take pity on\r\nher and bring her to Claudia to be cured. Gloriana in the meantime returns\r\nthe affections of Lysander, but the meeting of the lovers is interrupted\r\nby the jealous Francisco and a gang who wound Lysander and carry off\r\nGloriana. She escapes from her captors, but only after she has lost her\r\nreason, and wanders about until she meets with Cliton, who has turned\r\nhermit and who now undertakes her cure. Throughout the play we find comic\r\ninterludes by Scrub, a page or attendant in search of his master, who also\r\nhas some farcical business with the Lustful Shepherd, who after being\r\ndisappointed of Cloe disguises himself as a satyr, apparently deeming that\r\nrôle suited to his taste. In the end all the characters are brought\r\ntogether. Francisco, found contrite, is forgiven by Lysander and Gloriana;\r\nCliton and Florida love once more; so do Daphnes and Cloe, appropriately\r\nenough. Scrub announces the death of the usurping duke, 'who banished good\r\nold Leon;' Francisco and Lysander reveal themselves as princes who left\r\nthe court to win his daughter's love, when he was driven from his land,\r\nand so--love crowns the end.\r\n\r\nThrough this medley it is not hard to see the various debts the author has\r\nincurred towards his predecessors. The verse, in rimed couplets, whether\r\ndeca- or octo-syllabic, ultimately depends on Fletcher; of the comic prose\r\nscenes I have already spoken in dealing with Goffe's _Careless\r\nShepherdess_, a play the influence of which may perhaps be specifically\r\ntraced in the satyr-disguise, the gang who carry off Gloriana, her\r\nunexplained escape, and the songs of the 'Destinies' and a 'Heavenly\r\nMessenger,' who in their inconsequence recall the 'Bonus Genius' of\r\nGoffe's play. Scrub may owe his origin to the same source, though he is\r\nrather more like the page in the _Maid's Metamorphosis_. The usurping duke\r\nrecalls _As You Like It_; the princes seeking their love-fortunes among\r\nthe shepherd folk suggest the _Arcadia_; while the influence of the\r\n_Faithful Shepherdess_ is not only traceable in the character of the\r\nLustful Shepherd, but also in certain specific parallels, as where the\r\nwounded Lysander, seeing his love carried off, exclaims:\r\n\r\n    Stay, stay! let me but breathe my last\r\n    Upon her lips, and I'll forgive what's past; (p. 24)\r\n\r\na reminiscence of the lines spoken by Alexis in a similar situation:\r\n\r\n                 Oh, yet forbear\r\n    To take her from me! give me leave to die\r\n    By her! (_Faithful Shepherdess_, III. i. 165[347].)\r\n\r\nThe general level of the verse is not high, but we now and again light on\r\nsome pleasing lines such as the following:\r\n\r\n    My dearest love, fair as the eastern morn\r\n    As it breaks o'er the plains when summer's born,\r\n    Hanging bright liquid pearls on every tree,\r\n    New life and hope imparting, as to me\r\n    Thy presence brings delight, so fresh and rare\r\n    As May's first breath, dispensing such sweet air\r\n    The Phoenix does expire in; sit, while I play\r\n    The cunning thief, and steal thy heart away,\r\n    And thou shalt stand as judge to censure me. (p. 18.)\r\n\r\nSo again there is some grace in a song which catches perhaps a distant\r\necho of Peele's gem:\r\n\r\n    _Gloriana._ Sit, while I do gather flowers\r\n    And depopulate the bowers.\r\n    Here's a kiss will come to thee!\r\n\r\n    _Lysander._ Give me one, I'll give thee three!\r\n\r\n    _Both._ Thus in harmless sport we may\r\n    Pass the idle hours away.\r\n\r\n    _Gloriana._   Hark! hark, how fine\r\n    The birds do chime!\r\n    And pretty Philomel\r\n    Her moan doth tell. (p. 22.)\r\n\r\nAnother of these miniature pastorals is preserved in a British Museum\r\nmanuscript, where it bears the title of _The Converted Robber_.[348] No\r\nauthor's name appears, but a plausible conjecture may be advanced. The\r\nscene of the piece, namely, is Stonehenge, and it is evident that the\r\noccasion on which it was first performed had some connexion with\r\nSalisbury, for there is obviously a topical allusion in the final words:\r\n\r\n    Lett us that do noe envy beare um\r\n    Wish all felicity to Sarum.\r\n\r\nNow in 1636,[349] according to Anthony à Wood, there was acted at St.\r\nJohn's College, Oxford, a play by John Speed, entitled _Stonehenge_, the\r\noccasion being the return of Dr. Richard Baylie after his installation as\r\nDean of Salisbury. We can hardly be far wrong in identifying the two\r\npieces. The only difficulty is that in the manuscript the play is dated\r\n1637. This, however, may either be a mere slip of the scribe, or may\r\npossibly imply that the piece was produced in 1636-7, the scribe adopting\r\nthe popular and modern, whereas Wood always adhered to the old or legal\r\nreckoning.\r\n\r\nThe piece possesses a certain interest from the fact of its forming, in a\r\nstricter sense than any of the other pieces we have examined, a link\r\nbetween the drama and the masque. In this it somewhat resembles _Comus_,\r\nemploying a more or less dramatic plot as the setting for the formai\r\ndances of the masque.[350]\r\n\r\nThe story is simple enough. A band of robbers and a company of shepherds\r\nand shepherdesses keep on Salisbury Plain in the neighbourhood of\r\nStonehenge--'stoy[=n]age y^{e} wonder y^{t} is vpon that Playne of\r\nSarum'--which forms the background of the scene. It chanced that the\r\nshepherdess Clarinda, falling into the hands of the robbers, was saved\r\nfrom dishonour by their chief Alcinous, an action which won for him her\r\nlove, and having escaped, she returned dressed as a boy in order to serve\r\nhim. Meanwhile the robbers have decided to make a raid upon the shepherd\r\nfolk, and Alcinous, disguising himself as a stranger shepherd, mixes among\r\nthem, while his companions Autolicus and Conto lie in wait hard by. During\r\na festival Alcinous seeks the love of Castina, Clarinda's sister, and\r\nfinding her unmoved by entreaty threatens force. At this she attempts to\r\nstab herself, and the robber chief is so struck that he vows to reform and\r\nis converted to the pastoral life. His companions, left in the lurch, fall\r\nupon the shepherds of their own accord, but are soon brought to see reason\r\nby the hand and tongue of their chief, and are content to follow him in\r\nhis conversion. Clarinda now discovers herself and marries Alcinous, while\r\nCastina and her fellow shepherdess Avonia consent to reward their faithful\r\nswains, Palaemon and Dorus.\r\n\r\nIn this piece there is a rather conspicuous absence of motive and dramatic\r\nconstruction, the author claiming apparently the freedom of the masque.\r\nThe verse is mainly octosyllabic, sometimes blank, but the rough accentual\r\n'rime' is also used. Decasyllabics are rare. There is also some prose in\r\nthe comic part sustained by Autolicus and Conto and the aged clown Jarbus,\r\nas well as a certain amount of Spenserian archaism, and a good deal of\r\ndialect. Whether comic or romantic, the characters are singularly out of\r\nkeeping with their surroundings, while the conceit of paganizing the\r\nChristian worship appears to be carried to ludicrous lengths, until one\r\nrecollects that it depends almost entirely upon the substitution of the\r\nname of Pan for that of the Deity--a process no doubt facilitated by false\r\netymology. Thus Christ, who is spoken of by name, is called 'Pannes blest\r\nbabe.' After describing the foundation of Salisbury Cathedral, the old\r\nshepherd proceeds:\r\n\r\n    But sturdy shepherds brought all the other stones,\r\n    And reard up that great Munster all at once,\r\n    Wher shepherds each one, both woman and man,\r\n    Do come to worship theyr great God Pann.\r\n\r\nA rustic show formed the first part of an entertainment witnessed by\r\nCharles and Henrietta Maria at Richmond, after their return from a visit\r\nto Oxford in 1636. A clown named Tom comes in bearing a present for the\r\nqueen, and is on the point of being unceremoniously removed by the usher,\r\nwhen he espies Mr. Edward Sackville, to whom he appeals, and a dialogue\r\nensues between the two. After he has offered his present, Madge, Doll, and\r\nRichard come in, and the four perform a country dance. They are all plain\r\nWiltshire rustics who talk a broad vernacular, but at the end a shepherd\r\nand shepherdess enter and sing a duet in a more courtly strain. The author\r\nof this slight production is not known, but it is regarded by the latest\r\nauthority on masques as an imitation, in the looseness of its\r\nconstruction, of Davenant's _Prince d'Amour_.[351]\r\n\r\nLittle poetic ability was displayed by Heywood on the only occasion on\r\nwhich he introduced pastoral tradition into a Lord Mayor's pageant. The\r\n'first show by land' of the _Porta Pietatis_, presented by the drapers in\r\n1638 on the occasion of Sir Maurice Abbot's mayoralty, consisted of a\r\nspeech by a shepherd, which is preceded in the printed copy by a short\r\naccount of the properties, natural history, and general usefulness of\r\nsheep, as well as of their peculiar importance in relation to the craft\r\nhonoured in the person of the newly appointed Lieutenant of the city of\r\nLondon. Heywood was famous for his wide, miscellaneous, and often\r\nstartling information.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how, in the first blush and budding of the\r\nElizabethan spring, George Peele treated the tale of the judgement of\r\nParis; on the same legend Heywood based one of his semi-dramatic\r\ndialogues; it remains to be seen how, in the late autumn of the great age\r\nof our dramatic literature, Shirley returned to the same theme in his\r\n_Triumph of Beauty_, privately produced about 1640. It is a regular\r\nmasque, for which the familiar story serves as a thread; the goddesses and\r\ntheir symbolical attendants, or else the Graces and the Hours with Hymen\r\nand Delight, performing the dances, while a company of rustic swains of\r\nIda, who come to relieve the melancholy of the princely shepherd, form a\r\ncomic antimasque. It has, however, grown to the proportions of a small\r\nplay. The comic characters also study a piece on the subject of the golden\r\nfleece, reminiscent, like _Narcissus_, of the _Midsummer Night's Dream_.\r\nThis, as Mr. Fleay supposes, may well be satirical of some of the city\r\npageants, though it is best to be cautious in discovering definite\r\nallusions. But the success of such a piece as the present, in so far as it\r\nwas dependent on the _libretto_, demanded a power of light and graceful\r\nlyric versification which was not conspicuous among the many gifts of the\r\nauthor. The comic business is frankly amusing, but the long speeches of\r\nthe goddesses can hardly have appeared less tedious to a contemporary\r\naudience than they do to the reader to-day.\r\n\r\nI may also notice here a regular short pastoral in three acts, inserted by\r\nRobert Baron in his romance Ἐροτοπαίγνιον, _or the Cyprian Academy_,\r\nprinted in 1647. It is entitled _Gripus and Hegio, or the Passionate\r\nLovers_, and relates the loves of these characters for Mira and Daris;\r\nwhile we also find the familiar roguish boy, less amusing and of stricter\r\npropriety than usual; a chorus of fairies who discourse classical myth;\r\nVenus, Cupid, Hymen, and Echo; and the habitual concomitants of pastoral\r\ncommonplace. The romance also contains a masque entitled _Deorum Dona_, in\r\nwhich figure allegorical abstractions such as Fame, Fortune, and the like.\r\nIt is in no wise pastoral.\r\n\r\nAnother pastoral show of some elaboration, and of a higher order of poetry\r\nthan most of those we have been considering, is Sir William Denny's\r\n_Shepherds' Holiday_, printed from manuscript in the _Inedited Poetical\r\nMiscellany_ of 1870. The piece appears to date from 1653, and is only\r\nslightly dramatic so far as plot is concerned. It is of an allegorical\r\ncast, the various characters typifying certain virtues, or rather\r\ntemperaments--virginity, love and so forth--as is elaborately expounded in\r\nthe preface.\r\n\r\nA few slight pieces by the quondam actor Robert Cox, partaking more or\r\nless of the character of masques, possess a certain pastoral colouring.\r\nThis is the case, for instance, in the _Acteon and Diana_, published in\r\n1656.[352] The piece opens with the humours of the would-be lover Bumpkin,\r\na huntsman, and the dance of the country lasses round the May-pole. Then\r\nenters Acteon with his huntsmen, who is followed by Diana and her nymphs.\r\nUpon the dance of these last Acteon, returning, breaks in unawares, and is\r\nrebuked by the goddess, who then retires with her nymphs to a glade in the\r\nforest. They are in the act of despoiling themselves for the bath when\r\nthey are again surprised by Acteon. Incensed, the goddess turns upon him,\r\nand he flees before her anger, only to return once more upon the dance of\r\nthe bathers in the shape of a hart, and fall at their feet a prey to his\r\nown hounds. The verse, whether lyric or dramatic, is of a mediocre\r\ndescription, and the piece, if it was ever actually performed, no doubt\r\ndepended for success upon the music, dancing, and scenery. It is a curious\r\nfact, to which Davenant's work among others is witness, that the nominally\r\nprivate representation of this kind of musical ballet was permitted, while\r\nthe regular drama was under strict inhibition. At any time, however, it\r\nmust have been difficult to represent such a piece as the present without\r\nsacrificing either propriety or tradition.\r\n\r\nAnother similar composition, headed 'The Rural Sports on the Birthday of\r\nthe Nymph Oenone,' is printed together with the above. In it the strains\r\nof the polished pastoral are varied by the humours of the clown Hobbinall,\r\nthe whole ending with a speech by Pan and a dance of satyrs.\r\n\r\nOne obvions omission from the above catalogue will have been noticed. The\r\nreason thereof is sufficiently obvious; and the following section will\r\nendeavour to repair it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Milton's contribution to the fashionable masque literature of his day\r\nwe approach work the poetic supremacy of which has never been called in\r\nquestion, and whose other qualities, lying properly beyond the strict\r\napplication of that term, critics have habitually vied with one another to\r\nextol. No one, indeed, for whom poetry has any meaning whatever, can turn\r\nfrom the work of Peele, Heywood, and Shirley, of Ben Jonson even, to the\r\nearly works of Milton, to such comparatively immature works as _Arcades_\r\nand _Comus_, without being conscious that they belong to an altogether\r\ndifferent level of poetical production. It was no mere conventional\r\ncommendation, such as we may find prefixed to the works of any poetaster\r\nof the time, that Sir Henry Wotton addressed to the author of the Ludlow\r\nmasque: 'I should much commend the Tragical [i.e. dramatic] part, if the\r\nLyrical did not ravish me with a certain Dorique delicacy in your Songs\r\nand Odes, wherunto I must plainly confess to have seen yet nothing\r\nparallel in our Language[353].'\r\n\r\nThe two poems we have now to consider were, in all probability, written\r\nwithin a short while of one another, and the second anticipated by more\r\nthan three years the composition of _Lycidas_. But the connexion between\r\nthe two is not one of date only, nor even of the spectacular demand it was\r\nthe end of either to meet. It may, namely, in the absence of any definite\r\nevidence, be with much plausibility presumed that the impulse to the\r\nentertainment, of which as we are told _Arcades_ formed a part, originated\r\nwith that very Lady Alice Egerton and her two young brothers who, the\r\nfollowing year probably, bore the chief parts in _Comus_. The\r\nentertainment was presented at Harefield in honour of their grandmother,\r\nthe Countess Dowager of Derby. This lady, probably somewhat over seventy\r\nat the time, was the honoured head of a large family. The daughter of Sir\r\nJohn Spencer of Althorpe, born about 1560, she married first Ferdinando\r\nStanley, Lord Strange, afterwards Earl of Derby, patron of the company of\r\nactors with whom Shakespeare's name is associated; and secondly, after\r\nhis early death in 1594, the Lord Keeper, Sir Thomas Egerton, who rose by\r\nrapid steps to be Viscount Brackley shortly before his death in 1617. The\r\nspan of a human life appears strange when measured by the rapidly moving\r\nevents of the English renaissance. The wife of Shakespeare's patron, who\r\nmay have witnessed the early ventures of the Stratford lad at the time of\r\nhis first appearance on the London stage--the 'Amarillis' of _Colin\r\nClout_, with whom, and with her sisters 'Phillis' and 'Charillis,' Spenser\r\nclaimed kinship, and to whom he dedicated his _Tears of the Muses_ in\r\n1591--lived to see her grandchildren perform for her amusement in the\r\nreign of the first Charles an entertainment for which their music-master\r\nLawes had requisitioned the pen of the future author of _Paradise Lost_.\r\n\r\n_Arcades_, or 'the Arcadians,' can hardly be dignified by the name of a\r\nmasque; it is the mere embryo of the elaborate compositions which were at\r\nthe time fashionable under that name, and of which Milton was to rival the\r\nconstructional elaboration in his pastoral entertainment of the following\r\nyear. It rather resembles such amoebean productions as we find introduced\r\ninto the stage plays of the time; and was, no doubt, as the superscription\r\nexplicitly informs us, but 'Part of an entertainment presented to the\r\nCountess Dowager of Darby.' Nevertheless it is complete and\r\nself-contained, and to speak of it, as Professer Masson does, as 'part,\r\nand part only, of a masque,' is to give a wholly false impression; for,\r\nwhatever the rest of the entertainment may have been, there is not the\r\nleast reason to suppose that it had any connexion or relation with the\r\nportion that has survived. This runs to a little over one hundred lines. A\r\ngroup of nymphs and shepherds, coming from among the trees of the garden,\r\napproach the 'seat of State' where sits the venerable Countess, whom they\r\naddress in a song. As this ends their progress is barred by the Genius of\r\nthe Wood, who delivers a long speech.[354] This is followed by a song\r\nintroducing the dance, after which a third song brings the performance to\r\na close. It cannot be honestly said that the bulk of this slender poem is\r\nof any very transcendent merit; but the final song stands apart from the\r\nrest, and deserves notice both on its own account and for the sake of that\r\nto which it served as herald:\r\n\r\n    Nymphs and Shepherds dance no more\r\n      By sandy Ladons Lillied banks;\r\n    On old Lycaeus or Cyllene hoar\r\n      Trip no more in twilight ranks;\r\n    Though Erymanth your loss deplore\r\n      A better soyl shall give ye thanks.\r\n    From the stony Maenalus\r\n    Bring your Flocks, and live with us;\r\n    Here ye shall have greater grace\r\n    To serve the Lady of this place,\r\n      Though Syrinx your Pans Mistres were,\r\n      Yet Syrinx well might wait on her.\r\n        Such a rural Queen\r\n    All Arcadia hath not seen.\r\n\r\nHere we have, if nothing else, promise at least of the melodies to be, as\r\nalso of that harmonious interweaving of classical names which long years\r\nafter was to lend weight and dignity to the 'full and heightened style' of\r\nthe epic. One other point in connexion with the poem is noteworthy, the\r\nquality, namely, in virtue of which it claims our attention here. It is,\r\nindeed, not a little curious that on the only two occasions on which\r\nMilton was called upon to produce something of the order of the masque, he\r\ncast his work into a more or less pastoral form; and this in spite of the\r\nfact that, as we have seen, the form was by no means a prevalent one among\r\nthe more popular and experienced writers. It would appear as though his\r\nmind turned, through some natural bent or early association, to the\r\nemployment of this form; an idea which suggests itself all the more\r\nforcibly when we find him, a few years later, setting about the\r\ncomposition of a conventional lament in this mode on a young college\r\nacquaintance, and producing, through his power of alchemical\r\ntransmutation, one of the greatest works of art in the English language.\r\n\r\nIt was, no doubt, in the earlier months of 1634, while his friend Lawes\r\nwas engaged on the gorgeous and complicated staging and orchestration of\r\nthe _Triumph of Peace_ and the _Coelum Britannicum_, that Milton composed\r\nthe poem which perhaps more than any other has made readers of to-day\r\nfamiliar with the term 'masque.' In the second of the elaborate\r\nproductions just named--a poem, be it incidentally remarked, which does no\r\nparticular credit to the pen of its sometimes unsurpassed author, Tom\r\nCarew, but in the presentation of which the king and many of his chief\r\nnobles deigned to bear a part--minor rôles had been assigned to the two\r\nsons of the Earl of Bridgewater, namely, the Viscount Brackley and Master\r\nThomas Egerton. When the earl shortly afterwards went to assume the\r\nPresidency of the Welsh Marches, it was these two who, together with their\r\nsister the Lady Alice, bore the central parts in the masque performed\r\nbefore the assembled worthies of the West in the great hall of Ludlow\r\nCastle. The ages of the three performers ranged from eleven to thirteen,\r\nthe girl, who was the eighth daughter of the marriage, being the eldest.\r\n\r\nIt must have been a gay and imposing sight that greeted the spectators in\r\nthe grim old border fortress, the gaunt ruins of which may yet be seen,\r\nbut which had at that date already rubbed off some of its medieval\r\nruggedness as a place of defence. Though necessarily less elaborate and\r\ncostly than the performances in London, no pains were spared to make the\r\nspectacle worthy of the occasion, and it must have appeared all the more\r\nsplendid in contrast to its surroundings, presented as it was in the great\r\nhall in which met the Council of the Western Marches in the distant town\r\nupon the Welsh border. Nor did the occasion lack the heightening glamour\r\nand dramatic contrast of historical association, for in this very hall\r\njust a century and a half before, if tradition is to be credited, the\r\nunfortunate Prince Edward, son of Edward IV, was crowned before setting\r\nout with his young brother on the fatal journey which was to terminate\r\nunder a forgotten flagstone in the Tower of London.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to enter into any detailed account of the manner in which\r\nwe may suppose the masque to have been performed, nor into the literary\r\nhistory of the poem itself; to do so would be a work of supererogation in\r\nview of the able discussion of the whole subject from the pen of Professor\r\nMasson. The debts Milton owed to the _Somnium_ of Puteanus, to Peele's\r\n_Old Wives' Tale_ and to Fletcher's _Faithful Shepherdess_, are now all\r\nmore or less recognized. From the first he probably borrowed the name and\r\ncharacter of Comus himself, as well as a few incidental expressions. The\r\nsecond contains a remarkable parallel to the search of the two brothers\r\nfor their lost sister, which it is difficult to suppose fortuitous; while\r\nmany passages might be cited to prove Milton's close acquaintance with\r\nFletcher's poem[355].\r\n\r\nThe masque as performed at Ludlow Castle probably differed in one\r\nimportant particular from the form in which we know it, and which is that\r\nin which it left Milton's hand. This form is attested by the original\r\nquarto edition, by the texts of the Poems of 1645 and 1673, and by\r\nMilton's manuscript draft in the volume preserved at Trinity College,\r\nCambridge. The variant form is found in the manuscript at Bridgewater\r\nHouse, reputed to be in Lawes' handwriting, which seemingly represents the\r\nacting version. In Milton's text the scene discovered is a wild wood; the\r\nattendant Spirit descends, or enters, and at once launches out into a long\r\nspeech in blank verse. Lawes seems to have thought that it would be more\r\nappropriate for the Spirit--that is, for himself, for it appears that he\r\ntook the part--to open the performance with a song, and consequently\r\ntransferred to this place the first thirty-six lines of the final lyrical\r\nspeech of the Spirit, substituting the words 'From the heavens' for\r\nMilton's 'To the ocean.' The change was doubtless effective, and was\r\nskilfully made; yet one cannot help feeling that some of the magic of the\r\npoem has evaporated in the process. However, Lawes was loyal to his\r\nfriend, and whatever alterations his wider knowledge of the requirements\r\nof stage production may have led him to introduce into the masque as\r\nperformed at Ludlow, he never sought to foist any changes of his own into\r\nthe published poem, when, having tired himself with making copies for his\r\nfriends, he at length decided, with Milton's consent, to send it forth\r\ninto the world in its slender quarto garb.\r\n\r\nA brief analysis will serve to reveal the lines upon which the piece is\r\nconstructed, and to show how far it follows the traditions respectively of\r\nthe drama and the masque. The introductory speech puts the audience in\r\npossession of the situation, and informs them how the wood is haunted by\r\nComus and his crew, himself the son of Bacchus and Circe, and how they\r\nseek to trick unwary passengers into drinking of the fateful cup which\r\nshall transform them to the likeness of beasts and, driving all\r\nremembrance of home and friends from their imaginations, leave them\r\ncontent 'to roll with pleasure in a sensual sty.' Wherefore the Spirit is\r\nsent to guide the steps of those 'favoured of high Jove,' and save them\r\nfrom the wiles of the fleshly god. Announcing that he goes to assume 'the\r\nweeds and likeness of a swain,' so as to perform his charge unknown, the\r\nSpirit leaves the stage, which is at once invaded by Comus and his rout. A\r\nbrilliant speech by the god, preceding the first measure, illustrates the\r\nstrange but yet not infrequent irony of fate by which it has happened that\r\nthe most puritanical of poets have thrown the full weight of their best\r\nwork into the opposing scale, and clothed vice in magic colours to outdo\r\nthe richest fancies of the libertine. No doubt this reckless adorning of\r\nsin was intentional on Milton's part; he painted the pleasures of κῶμος in\r\ntheir most seductive colours, that the triumph of virtue might appear by\r\nso much the greater, fancying that it was enough to assert that final\r\nvictory, and failing, like most preachers, to perceive that unless it was\r\nmade psychologically and artistically convincing the total effect would be\r\nthe very reverse of that which he intended. If we compare the speech of\r\nComus with that of the Lady on her first appearance, we shall hardly\r\nescape the conclusion that then, as indeed always, Milton had a mere\r\nschoolboy's idea of 'plot,' as of some combination of events to be infused\r\nwith the breath of life at his own will, and from without, not such as\r\nshould spring from the fundamental elements of the characters themselves.\r\nIn the midst of dance and revel Comus interrupts his followers:\r\n\r\n    Break off, break off, I feel the different pace\r\n    Of some chast footing neer about this ground;\r\n\r\nand the crew vanishes among the trees as the Lady enters alone and\r\nnarrates how she lost her brothers at nightfall in the wood, and attracted\r\nby the sounds of mirth has bent hither her steps in the hope of finding\r\nsome one to direct her. She then sings a song by way of attracting her\r\nbrothers' attention, should they chance to be near. As she ends Comus\r\nre-enters in guise of a shepherd, and offers to escort her to his hut\r\nwhere she may rest until her companions are found. She has no sooner left\r\nthe stage than these enter in search of her, and while away the time with\r\na long discussion on the dangers of the wood and the protective power of\r\nvirtue. To them at length enters the attendant Spirit, who has certainly\r\nbeen so far very remiss in his duties, in the habit of their father's\r\nshepherd Thirsis; and on hearing how they have parted company with their\r\nsister, tells of Comus and his enchantments, and arming his hearers with\r\nhemony, powerful against all spells, guides them to the hall of the\r\nsorcerer. The scene now changes to the interior of the palace of Comus,\r\n'set out with all manner of deliciousness,' where the god and his rabble\r\nare feasting. On one side we may imagine an open arcade giving on to the\r\nbanks of the Severn, silvery in the moonlight, the cool purity of its\r\nwaters contrasting with the rich jewelled light and perfumed air within.\r\nWe see the Lady seated in an enchanted chair, while before her stands the\r\nmagician, wand in hand, offering her wine in a crystal goblet. Then\r\nfollows the dialogue in which the Lady defends her virtue against the\r\nblandishments of Comus, till at last her brothers, followed by the\r\nspirit-shepherd, rush in and disperse the revellers. The Lady is now found\r\nto be fixed like marble in the chair of enchantment, but the attendant\r\nSpirit shows his resource by calling to their help the virgin goddess of\r\nthe stream:\r\n\r\n    Sabrina fair\r\n      Listen where thou art sitting\r\n    Under the glassie, cool, translucent wave,\r\n      In twisted braids of Lillies knitting\r\n    The loose train of thy amber-dropping hair,\r\n      Listen for dear honour's sake,\r\n      Goddess of the silver lake,\r\n                    Listen and save.\r\n\r\nThus conjured in some of the most perfectly musical lines in the language\r\nthe daughter of Locrine rises from her waves, and enters the hall with a\r\nsong, attended by her obedient nymphs. Having broken the spell and freed\r\nthe captive Lady, she at once departs with her train, and after another\r\nspeech by the Spirit, the scene changes to the town and castle of Ludlow,\r\na bevy of shepherds dancing in the foreground. After these have concluded\r\ntheir measure, the wanderers enter, still guided by the spirit-shepherd,\r\nwho presents them safe and sound to their parents. Then follows another\r\ndance, and the Spirit, throwing off, we may presume, his pastoral\r\ndisguise, launches into his final speech:\r\n\r\n    To the Ocean now I fly,\r\n    And those happy climes that ly\r\n    Where day never shuts his eye;\r\n\r\nconcluding:\r\n\r\n    Mortals that would follow me,\r\n    Love vertue, she alone is free,\r\n    She can teach ye how to clime\r\n    Higher than the Spheary chime;\r\n    Or if Vertue feeble were,\r\n    Heav'n it self would stoop to her.\r\n\r\nSuch is the bare outline, the skeleton of the piece; what, we cannot help\r\nwondering, was it like when it first appeared clothed in the beauty of the\r\nflesh and inspired with the spirit of song? Its fashion and its form we\r\nhave indeed yet before us, though nothing can again quicken it into the\r\nlife it enjoyed for one brief hour nearly three hundred years ago. We must\r\nbe thankful that we count the poem itself among our treasures, and be\r\ncontent to confine our inquiry to it. It is, after all, to the accidents\r\nof its production as the body to the robes that adorn it.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that outwardly at least _Comus_ has but little\r\nconnexion with pastoral. The habit of the Spirit, the disguise of the\r\nmagician, the dance in the third scene, these are the only points serving\r\nto connect the poem with pastoral tradition in any formal manner. It is\r\nnot, however, on account of these that _Comus_ has been commonly assigned\r\nto the same category as the _Faithful Shepherdess_ and _Lycidas_, but\r\nrather because its whole tone, its mode, one might almost say, is\r\nessentially pastoral, and because it is directly dependent upon previous\r\npastoral work.\r\n\r\nIt has been the fashion to praise _Comus_ above all other masques\r\nwhatever, and from the point of view of the poetry it contains it would be\r\nidle to dispute its supremacy. But there are other considerations. As a\r\nmasque proper, and from the point of view of what had come to be expected\r\nof such compositions, how does it stand? I am not here concerned to\r\ninquire how far the term can with strict propriety be applied to the\r\npiece, a question which may be left to the somewhat arid region of the\r\nformal classification of literature. The points in which it resembles the\r\nregular spectacular masques, as well as those in which it differs from\r\nthem, will be alike evident from the analysis given above. It may,\r\nhowever, be well to put in a caution against the manner in which some\r\nwriters on the masque seek to make their distinctions appear more clearly\r\ndefined than they in reality are by declaring _Comus_ to be not a masque\r\nat all but a play. It is no more a regular play than it is a strict\r\nmasque, but a dramatic composition containing elements of both in almost\r\nequal proportions.\r\n\r\nThat the songs are for the most part exquisite, that they were worthily\r\nset to music and adequately rendered; that the measures, the dance of the\r\nrevellers in their half-brutish disguises, the antimasque of country folk,\r\nand the final or main dance of the wanderers, were effective; that the\r\nwhole was graceful, complete and polished, is either self-evident to-day,\r\nor may with reason be inferred. The scenery, too, must have been striking;\r\nthe dreary forest, its darkness just relieved by the half-seen\r\n'glistering' forms; the heavy drug-like splendour of the enchanted palace\r\nand the cold moonlight outside; the bright, fresh sunshine, lastly,\r\ndew-washed, of the early morning; there were here a series of pictures the\r\ncontrasts of which must have added to their individual effect. The scene,\r\nthe song and the measure, these form, indeed, the very stuff that masques\r\nare made of. But Milton's poem offered more than this; and it may well be\r\nquestioned how far this more was of a nature to recommend it to the tastes\r\nof his audience, or indeed to heighten rather than to diminish its merits\r\nas a work of literature and art. There was, in the first place, a\r\nphilosophical and moral intention, which, however veiled in fanciful\r\nimagery and clothed in limpid verse, is yet not content to be an inspiring\r\nprinciple and artistic occasion of the poem, but obtrudes itself directly\r\nin the length of some of the speeches; refuses, that is, to subserve the\r\naesthetic purpose, and endeavours to divert the poetic beauty to its own\r\nnon-aesthetic ends. In the second place, and probably of greater\r\nimportance as regards the actual success of the piece on the stage, it\r\ncontained somewhat of dramatic emotion, of incident which depended for its\r\nvalue upon its effect on the characters involved, which was ill served by\r\nthe spectacular machinery and necessary limitations of the composition,\r\nwhile at the same time it must have interfered with the opportunity for\r\nmere sensuous effect which it was the main business of the masque to\r\nafford. The weight which different persons will attach to these objections\r\nwill no doubt vary with their individual temperaments, their\r\nsusceptibility to the magical charm of the verse, their sense of artistic\r\npropriety, and the degree to which they are able to recall in imagination\r\nthe conditions of a bygone form of artistic presentation. I speak for\r\nmyself when I say that, in fitness for the particular end it had to serve,\r\nMilton's poem appears to me to be surpassed, for instance, by the best of\r\nJonson's masques, no less than it surpasses them, and all others of their\r\nkind, in the poetical beauty of the verse, whether of the 'tragical' or\r\nlyrical portions.\r\n\r\nSince I have ventured to formulate certain objections against an\r\nacknowledged masterpiece, it will be well that I should define as clearly\r\nas possible the ground upon which those objections are based. I have, I\r\nhope, sufficiently emphasized my dissent from that school of criticism\r\nwhich condemns a work of art for not conforming to one or another of a\r\nseries of fixed types. That _Comus_ lies, so to speak, midway between the\r\ndrama and the masque, and partakes of the nature of either, is not, by any\r\ninherent law of literary aesthetics, a blemish; what in my view is a\r\nblemish, and that a serions one, is that the means employed are not\r\ncalculated to the demands of the situation. The struggle of the Lady\r\nagainst the subtle enchanter, the search of the brothers for their lost\r\nsister, the safe event of their wanderings, are all points which, however\r\nsimple in themselves, yet excite our interest; however certain we may feel\r\nthat virtue in the person of the Lady will never fall to the allurements\r\nof Comus, they neither of them become a mere abstraction. That is to say\r\nthat, little as there may be of plot, the interest is that of the drama,\r\nan interest really felt in the fate of the characters; while the medium\r\nadopted is that of the masque, with its spectacular machinery, even if not\r\nin its regular and orthodox form. It follows that the dramatic interest is\r\na clog on the scenic elaboration of the form, while the form is\r\nnecessarily inadequate to the rendering of the content.\r\n\r\nIt is significant that in all the early editions the piece is merely\r\nstyled 'A Maske Presented At Ludlow Castle'; the title of _Comus_ was\r\nfirst affixed by Warton. It was an obvious title for a critic to adopt; it\r\nis probably the last that the author would himself have thought of\r\nchoosing. Had it been named contemporaneously, and after the fashion of\r\nthe masques at court, the title of the _Triumph of Virtue_ could not but\r\nhave suggested itself. This is indeed the very theme of the piece. Virtue\r\nin the person of the Lady, guarded by her brothers, watched over by the\r\nattendant Spirit, aided at need by the nymph Sabrina, triumphant over the\r\nblandishments and temptations of fancy and of sense in the persons of\r\nComus and his followers; that is the subject of the masque. It is a\r\nsubject finely and suitably conceived for spectacular illustration, and\r\npossesses a moral after Milton's own heart. The closing lines of the poem,\r\nalready quoted, give admirable expression to the motive. Were the subject,\r\non the other hand, to be treated dramatically, then the character of the\r\nLady, virtue at grip with evil, was worthy to exercise--had; indeed, in\r\nvarying forms long exercised--the highest dramatic genius. But in this\r\ndirection lay, consciously or unconsciously, one of Milton's most evident\r\nlimitations, and had he attempted to give full dramatic expression to the\r\nidea it is not improbable that the experiment would have resulted in\r\nundeniable failure. From such an attempt he was, however, debarred by the\r\nterms of his commission, which demanded not a drama, but a spectacular\r\nperformance. Yet in spite of this Milton's conception of the piece is, as\r\nwe have seen, essentially dramatic, and consequently in so far as the\r\nmeans prevented the due fulfilment of that conception in so far must the\r\nLady necessarily fall short of the adequate realization of her high rôle.\r\nThe action is too much abstracted, the characters too allegorical, to\r\nsatisfy in us the dramatic expectations which they nevertheless call\r\nforth; while, on the other hand, they remain too concrete and individual\r\nto be adequately rendered by purely spectacular means.\r\n\r\nThese considerations have an important bearing upon the other objection\r\nwhich I ventured to bring forward, that of moralizing; for it cannot be\r\nargued, I imagine, that the direct expression of philosophical or ethical\r\nideas is in any way illegitimate in the masque proper, any more than it is\r\nin the choric ode. But, as I have said, Milton--no doubt intentionally,\r\nthough the point is irrelevant--has raised dramatic issues and dramatic\r\nemotions, and consequently by the laws of the drama, that is, by his\r\nsuccess in satisfying those emotions, he must be judged. All speeches\r\ntherefore introduced with a directly moral and philosophical rather than a\r\ndramatic end must be pronounced artistic solecisms. Whether Milton has\r\nbeen guilty of such undramatic interpolations, such lapses from the one\r\nend of art, may be left to the individual judgement of each reader to\r\ndetermine; for my own part I cannot conceive that any doubt should exist.\r\n\r\nBut even if we pass over what some readers will be inclined to dismiss as\r\na mere theoretical objection, there are other charges which these same\r\npassages will have to meet. Those who have borne with me in my remarks on\r\nthe _Aminta_ and the _Faithful Shepherdess_, will probably also agree with\r\nme here, when I say that to me at least there is something not altogether\r\npleasing in Milton's presentment of virtue. I should add at once, that to\r\nplace Milton's poem on an ethical level with either of the above-mentioned\r\npieces would, of course, be preposterous. It is impossible to doubt the\r\nsevere chastity of Milton's own ideal, and to compare it for one moment to\r\nthe conventional _onestà_ which replaced virtue in Tasso's world, or with\r\nthe nauseous unreality of the puppet Fletcher sought to enthrone in its\r\nplace, would be to commit an uncritical outrage. Nevertheless, the\r\nexpression Milton chose to give to his ideal cannot, therefore, lay claim\r\nto privilege. That expression had become intimately associated with\r\npastoral convention, and he accepted it along with much else from his\r\npredecessors. I am not aware of any reason why spectators should have been\r\nprejudiced otherwise than in favour of the Lady Alice Egerton; but she is,\r\nnevertheless, careful to take the first opportunity of informing them,\r\nwith much earnest protestation, of her quite remarkable purity and virtue,\r\nimplying as it were a naïve surprise at having arrived unsullied at the\r\nperilous age of thirteen. The stilted affectation of this self-conscious\r\ninnocence is perhaps less evident in the scene in which we should most\r\nreadily look for it--that, namely, in which the Lady defends herself from\r\nthe persuasions of the Sorcerer, where a certain fervour of feeling raises\r\nher utterances above a merely colourless level--than in the long soliloquy\r\nin which she indulges on first appearing on the stage. Something of the\r\nsame disagreeable quality is present in the rather mawkish discussion\r\nbetween her two young brothers. Milton, who is entirely untouched, either\r\nwith the levity of Tasso or the cynicism of Fletcher, was undoubtedly\r\nhimself wholly unconscious that any such charge could be brought against\r\nhis work. It is the direct outcome of a certain obtuseness, a curious want\r\nof delicacy, which in his later work results at times in passages of\r\noffensively bad taste[356]. As yet it is hardly responsible for anything\r\nworse than a confused conception in the poet's imagination. [Greek: Πάντα\r\nκαθαρὰ τοῖς καθαροῖς], and the allegory is an old one whereby virtue\r\nappears as the tamer of the beasts of the wild. It is, however, to those\r\nalone who are innocent of evil that belongs the faery talisman. The\r\nvirtue, knowing of itself and of the world, may be held a surer defence,\r\nbut it is by comparison a gross and earthly buckler, with less of the\r\nglamour of romance reflected from its aegis-mirror. Somehow one feels\r\ninstinctively that Una did not, on meeting with the lion, launch forth\r\ninto a protestation of her chastity. Nothing, of course, would be easier\r\nthan by means of a little judicious misrepresentation to cast ridicule\r\nupon the whole of Milton's conception of virtue in woman, and nowhere is\r\nit more needful than in such a case as the present to remember the\r\nfundamental maxim that bids one take the position one is attacking at its\r\nstrongest. Nevertheless, putting aside for the moment all questions of art\r\nand all considerations of taste, there remains a question worthy of being\r\nfully and carefully stated, and of being honestly entertained. Milton has\r\ndeliberately penned passages of smug self-conceit upon a subject whose\r\ndelicacy he was apparently incapable of appreciating, and these passages\r\nhe has placed, to be spoken in her own person, in the mouth of a child\r\njust passing into the first dawn of adolescence, thereby outraging at once\r\nthe innocence of childhood and the reticence of youth. Is it possible to\r\npretend that this is an action upon which moral censure has no word to\r\nsay[357]?\r\n\r\nIt would hardly have been necessary to emphasize this point of view, or\r\nto dwell upon objections which, when one surrenders to the magic of the\r\nverse, can hardly appear other than carping, were it not for the somewhat\r\ninjudicious and undiscriminating praise which it has been the fashion of a\r\ncertain school of critics to lavish upon the piece. The exquisite quality\r\nof the verse may be readily conceded, as may also the nobleness of\r\nMilton's conception and the brilliance, within certain limits, of the\r\nexecution; but when we are further challenged to admire the 'moral\r\ngrandeur' of the figure in which virtue is honoured, there are some at\r\nleast who will feel tempted to reply in the significant words: 'Methinks\r\nthe lady doth protest too much!'\r\n\r\nA word may be said finally as to the quality of the verse. I need not\r\nrepeat that it is exquisite, that the music of it is like a full stream\r\noverflowing the rich pastures; what I am concerned to maintain is, that it\r\nis not for the most part of Milton's best. In the first place, what, for\r\nwant of a better name, I have called Milton's moralizing is a blemish upon\r\nthe poetic as it is upon the dramatic merits of the piece. The muse of\r\npoetry, like all her sisters, is not slow in avenging herself of a divided\r\nallegiance. By the cynical irony of fortune already noticed, where Milton\r\nwould most impress us with his moral he becomes least poetical. There is,\r\nit is true, hardly a speech or a song which does not contain lines worthy\r\nto rank with any in the language, from the opening words:\r\n\r\n    Before the starry threshold of Joves Court,\r\n\r\nto the final couplet:\r\n\r\n    Or if Virtue feeble were,\r\n    Heav'n it self would stoop to her.\r\n\r\nBut there are passages in which these memorable lines appear as so much\r\nrich embroidery superimposed upon the baser fabric of the verse, not woven\r\nof the woof. They are in their nature more easily detached, and often form\r\nthe best known and most often quoted passages of the work. Take the first\r\nspeech of the Lady, concerning which something has already been said. Here\r\nwe find the lines:\r\n\r\n    They left me then, when the gray-hooded Eev'n\r\n    Like a sad Votarist in Palmer's weed\r\n    Rose from the hindmost wheels of Phoebus wain;\r\n\r\nor again:\r\n\r\n             A thousand fantasies\r\n    Begin to throng into my memory\r\n    Of calling shapes, and beckning shadows dire,\r\n    And airy tongues, that syllable mens names\r\n    On Sands, and Shoars, and desert Wildernesses;\r\n\r\nor yet again:\r\n\r\n    Was I deceiv'd, or did a sable cloud\r\n    Turn forth her silver lining on the night?\r\n\r\nWe have the song:\r\n\r\n    Sweet Echo, sweetest Nymph that liv'st unseen\r\n                Within thy airy shell\r\n      By slow Meander's margent green,\r\n    And in the violet imbroider'd vale\r\n      Where the love-lorn Nightingale\r\n    Nightly to thee her sad Song mourneth well.\r\n\r\nSuch lines would justly render famous any passage in any poem in which\r\nthey occurred. Nevertheless, remove them, which can be done without\r\nmaterial injury to the sequence of the thought, and see whether in its\r\nwarp and web the speech can for a moment stand comparison with that of\r\nComus, to which it stands in direct and dramatic contraposition.\r\n\r\nBut this drawback is only incidental; through nine-tenths of the piece,\r\nperhaps, there is little or no moral preoccupation to disturb us. And\r\nhere, though no doubt the poetic beauty reaches a climax in the song to\r\nSabrina--a song for pure music certainly unsurpassed and probably\r\nunequalled by anything else that Milton ever wrote--there are others, such\r\nas 'By the rushy-fringed bank,' as well as less distinctively lyrical\r\npassages, which come within measurable distance even of its perfection.\r\nAnd yet, with certain noticeable exceptions, there are few passages in\r\nwhich comparison with Milton's later works will not reveal technical\r\nimmaturity. This is no less true of the decasyllabic verse, when compared\r\nwith the full sonority of _Lycidas_, than of the shorter measures. Take,\r\nfor example, the invocation of Sabrina which follows the song previously\r\nquoted--the speech beginning:\r\n\r\n    Listen and appear to us\r\n    In name of great Oceanus.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its very great beauty there is observable at the same time a\r\ncertain monotony of cadence, and an occasional want of success in the\r\nattempts to relieve it, which place the passage distinctly below Milton's\r\nbest. And yet it seems almost ungenerous to place Milton even below\r\nhimself, particularly when in the very speech we are criticizing we are\r\nbrought face to face with two such flawless lines as those on 'fair\r\nLigea's golden comb',\r\n\r\n    Wherwith she sits on diamond rocks\r\n    Sleeking her soft alluring locks--\r\n\r\nlines which anticipate and rival the perfection of rhythmic modulation in\r\n_L'Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_[358].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThere remains to inquire what influence of pastoral tradition is traceable\r\nin the wider field of the romantic drama, whether in individual scenes and\r\ncharacters, or more vaguely in general tone and sentiment; and, finally,\r\nto consider for a moment the critical expression given by writers of\r\nvarious dates to the sentimental philosophy of life which went under the\r\nname of pastoralism in fashionable circles.\r\n\r\nThe number of plays in which definite pastoral elements can be traced is\r\nsurprisingly small, even when every allowance has been made for the fact\r\nthat we have already included in our examination several pieces which come\r\nbut doubtfully within the fold. The spirit of the romantic drama, instinct\r\nwith sturdy life, had little in common with the artificial and unreal\r\nsentiment of a tradition which had almost ceased to pretend to a basis in\r\nthe emotions of natural humanity. The result was, as might be expected,\r\nthat when the drama introduced characters of a nominally pastoral type,\r\nthey were either direct transcripts from actual life, deliberately\r\nignoring conventional tradition, or else specifie borrowings from that\r\ntradition, introduced with full consciousness of its fashionable\r\nunreality, and using that unreality for a definite dramatic purpose. Thus,\r\nalthough the basis of pastoralism is found in non-traditional garb, and\r\nthough pastoralism itself is found as the subject of dramatic treatment,\r\nyet, so far as the introduction of individual scenes and characters is\r\nconcerned, it is seldom possible to say that pastoral has influenced the\r\nromantic drama in any sensible degree.\r\n\r\nA certain number of plays, presumably of a more or less pastoral nature,\r\nhave perished. Thus no trace remains of the _Lusus Pastorales_ licensed to\r\nRichard Jones in 1565, the nature of which can be only vaguely\r\nconjectured. The early date of the entry renders it important, and it is\r\nmuch to be regretted that the work should have perished, since it might\r\nhave thrown very interesting light upon the condition of pastoralism in\r\nEngland previous to the appearance of the _Shepherd's Calender_. Most\r\nprobably, however, the piece, whatever it may have been, was composed in\r\nLatin. We also have to lament the non-survival of a _Phillida and Corin_,\r\nwhich, we learn from the Revels' accounts, was acted by the Queen's men\r\nbefore the court, at Greenwich, on St. Stephen's day, 1584. This again\r\nwould be an interesting piece to possess, since the title suggests a\r\npurely pastoral composition contemporary with Peele's mythological play.\r\nOn February 28, 1592, Lord Strange's men performed a piece at the Rose,\r\nthe title of which is given by Henslowe as 'clorys & orgasto,' presumably\r\n_Chloris and Ergasto_. It was an old play, probably dating from some years\r\nearlier. Whether 'a pastorall plesant Commedie of Robin Hood and little\r\nJohn,' entered to Edward White in the Stationers' Register, on May 14,\r\n1594, could have justified its title may be questioned, but it is curious\r\nas suggesting an anticipation of Jonson's experiment. Again, on July 17,\r\n1599, George Chapman received of Philip Henslowe forty shillings, in\r\nearnest of a 'Pastorall ending in a Tragydye,' which, however, was\r\napparently never finished. Possibly our loss is not great, for Chapman's\r\ntalents hardly lay in this line; but a tragical ending to a play of the\r\npure pastoral type would have been something of a novelty, and the early\r\ndate would also have lent it some interest. Yet another play known to us\r\nsolely from Henslowe's accounts is the _Arcadian Virgin_, on which Chettle\r\nand Haughton were at work for the Admiral's men in December, 1599, and for\r\nwhich they received sums amounting in all to fifteen shillings. The title\r\nsuggests that the play may have been founded on the story of Atalanta, but\r\nit was probably not completed. Ben Jonson's _May Lord_, which we know only\r\nthrough the notes left by Drummond of his conversations, was almost\r\ncertainly not dramatic, though critics have always accepted it as such;\r\nbut the same authority records that Jonson at the time of his visit to\r\nHawthornden was contemplating a fisher-play, the scene to be laid on the\r\nshores of Loch Lomond. There is no evidence that the scheme ever reached a\r\nmore mature stage. Finally, I may mention a play entitled _Alba_, a Latin\r\npastoral, which incurred the royal displeasure when performed before James\r\nand his consort in the hall of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1605. The\r\nhistorian of the visit, quoted by Nichols, says that 'It was a pastoral,\r\nmuch like one which I have seen in King's College, Cambridge, but acted\r\nfar worse.' The allusion is presumably to the Latin translation of the\r\n_Pastor fido_. The cause of offence was the appearance of 'five or six men\r\nalmost naked,' who no doubt represented satyrs.\r\n\r\nTo what extent these plays were of a pastoral character must, of course,\r\nbe matter of conjecture. They may have been pastoral plays of a more or\r\nless regular type, they may have been mythological dramas, or they may\r\nhave been distinguished from the ordinary run of romantic compositions by\r\na few incidental traits of pastoralism only. Not a few pieces of the\r\nlatter description have been preserved, pieces in which definite traces\r\nof pastoral are to be found, but which cannot as a whole be included in\r\nthe kind.\r\n\r\nWe have already had occasion to note the very slight pastoral influence\r\nwhich exists in the short masques or dialogues of Thomas Heywood, in spite\r\nof the opportunity afforded by their mythological character. The same may\r\nbe noticed in the plays in which he drew his subject from classical\r\nlegend. _Love's Mistress_ is the appropriate and attractive title of a\r\ndramatization of the last-born fancy of the mythopoeic spirit of Greece,\r\nApuleius' tale of Cupid and Psyche. The early editions add to the title\r\nthe further designation of 'The Queen's Masque.' The work is indeed a\r\ncomposite piece, a masque grown into a play through the accretion of\r\nforeign matter, and was probably in its original state a far simpler\r\ncomposition than it now appears. The writing is in a dainty vein, and had\r\nthe piece been completed in a manner consonant with the simple and idyllic\r\ngrace of the earlier scenes, it would have been no such unequal companion\r\nto Peele's _Arraignment of Paris_. What the play contains of pastoral\r\nbelongs to one of the accretions. It is a rustic element in the\r\ninterludes, satiric and farcical, supplied by a country clown, some\r\nshepherds, and 'a shee Swaine,' Amarillis. In his _Ages_ the pastoral\r\nelement shrinks to an occasional dance and song. Thus in the _Golden Age_\r\nthe satyrs and nymphs sing a song in honour of Diana, which introduces the\r\ndisguised Jupiter in his courtship of Calisto. In the _Silver Age_, again,\r\nthe rape of Proserpine by Pluto is preluded by a song of 'a company of\r\nSwaines, and country Wenches' in honour of Ceres.\r\n\r\nAn unkind and quite worthless tradition, based on a manuscript note in an\r\nold copy, has connected Peele's name with the lengthy and tedious drama of\r\n_Sir Clyomon and Sir Clamydes_. It was admitted into the canon of Peele's\r\nworks by Dyce, and though Mr. Bullen differed from his predecessor as to\r\nthe justness of the ascription, he retained it in his edition. We find in\r\nit a coarse, dialect-speaking rustic, named Corin, who at one point\r\nsuccours Clyomon, and with whom Neronis, daughter of the King and Queen of\r\nthe Strange Marshes, seeks service in the disguise of a boy. Apart from\r\nhis name and the profession of shepherd he is a mere countryman, with\r\nnothing to connect him with pastoral tradition, though the princess'\r\naction finds, of course, abundant parallels therein. The _Old Wives'\r\nTale_, printed as 'by G. P.,' and of which there is no reason to question\r\nPeele's authorship, connects itself with pastoral chiefly through the\r\nalready mentioned parallel which it affords to _Comus_. It also\r\nanticipates, in a song of harvesters, the introduction of the 'sunburnt\r\nsicklemen' of the _Tempest_ masque.\r\n\r\nAt a later date we find Shirley in his _Love Tricks_ introducing two\r\nsisters who leave their home and, taking the disguise of shepherd and\r\nshepherdess, dwell among the country folk in the fields and pastures,\r\nwhither they are followed by their lovers. There are passages which reveal\r\na genuine pastoral tone, such as Shirley could readily adopt when it\r\nsuited his purpose, and it is not only in the measure that the tradition\r\nreveals itself in such lines as:\r\n\r\n    A shepherd is a king whose throne\r\n    Is a mossy mountain, on\r\n    Whose top we sit, our crook in hand,\r\n    Like a sceptre of command,\r\n    Our subjects, sheep grazing below,\r\n    Wanton, frisking to and fro. (IV. ii.)\r\n\r\nAgain, in the _Grateful Servant_ we have a show of 'Satyres pursuing\r\nNymphes; they dance together. Exeunt Satyres; three Nymphes seem to\r\nintreat [Lodowick] to goe with them,' accompanied by a song of Silvanus.\r\n\r\nYet slighter traces of pastoral are to be occasionally found in other\r\nplays of the period. Thus in Brome's _Love-Sick Court_ the swains and\r\nnymphs are led in the dance by characters who have sought and found a cure\r\nfor love among the country folk. In John Jones' _Adrasta_, the scene of\r\nwhich is laid at Florence, several of the characters disguise themselves\r\nin pastoral attire, and there is one definitely pastoral scene in which\r\nthey appear in the midst of real shepherds and shepherdesses. The play was\r\nprinted in 1635, and it is noticeable as containing, in the pastoral\r\nscene, satire on the Puritans resembling that introduced by Jonson in the\r\n_Sad Shepherd_. So again, similar disguisings, though of a less\r\npronouncedly pastoral character, occur in the anonymous _Knave in Grain_,\r\nin which the scene is Venice. Satyrs and nymphs, clowns and maids, join in\r\na song in Nashe's curious allegorical show entitled _Summer's Last Will\r\nand Testament_; nymphs and satyrs appear in the interludes of Dekker's\r\n_Old Fortunatus_; Silvanus, with nymphs and satyrs, perform a sort of\r\ninterlude with song in the anonymous _Wily Beguiled_; and, lastly, we have\r\nthe morris danced by the countrymen and wenches who accompany the jailor's\r\ndaughter in the _Two Noble Kinsmen_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe wider influence of tone and spirit is, in the nature of the case, far\r\nmore difficult to determine. It is possible that some court-plays may show\r\nthe influence of the artificial arrangement of characters and the\r\nconventional play of motives characteristic of the pastoral drama. But it\r\nis a matter of the greatest difficulty to analyse with certainty such\r\nstructural peculiarities as these, still more so to assign them with\r\nconfidence to their proper origin. Many characteristics which one might at\r\nfirst sight put down to the influence of the pastoral drama are, in\r\nreality, far more likely to be due to that of the comic stage of Italy in\r\ngeneral. But while it would be rash to assert that the pastoral plays in\r\nthis country exercised any wide influence over the regular drama, there\r\ncan be no question such an influence was exercised to a very appreciable\r\ndegree by pastoral poetry in general. I am not thinking of the romances at\r\nthis moment, for as we have already seen it was the non-pastoral elements\r\nin the pastoral novel that exerted such influence as can be traced over\r\nthe drama, but rather of the pastoral ideal and the pastoral mode in\r\ngeneral, as expressed either in the lyric, the eclogue, or the drama. In\r\nthis the drama shared an influence which was also exercised on other\r\ndepartments of literature. Numerous songs might be quoted from the scenes\r\nof the Elizabethan dramatists in support of this contention; while, on the\r\nother hand, we also find dramatic and descriptive passages the idyllic\r\nquality of which may not unreasonably be referred to a pastoral source.\r\n\r\nThis tendency of the drama to absorb pastoral elements rather from the\r\nlyric and the idyll than from regular plays in that kind is significant.\r\nIt is the acknowledgement of an important fact, which pastoralism failed\r\nto recognize; namely, that as the expression of the pastoral idea gained\r\nin complexity of artistic structure it lost in vitality. The pastoral\r\ndrama, born late in time, was the outcome of very especial circumstances,\r\nemphatically the child of its age, and little calculated to serve the\r\nartistic requirements of any other. Once the creative impulse that gave it\r\nlife was withdrawn the falsity of the kind as a form of art became\r\nmanifest; and though it lingered on for many years its life was but that\r\nof a fashionable toy, with little or no hold over the vital literature of\r\nits day. The popularity of the pastoral eclogue or idyll was of far longer\r\nduration. Though the form was more or less definitely conditioned, it had\r\nless of the structural rigidity of the drama, it brought its subject less\r\ninto contact with the hard limitations of reality, and, which may also\r\nhave been important, brought it less into comparison with other\r\nsubject-matter employing the same or a closely analogous form. Thus it was\r\nbetter able to adapt itself to the tastes and requirements of various\r\nages, and found favour in such vastly different societies as those for\r\nwhich Theocritus, Mantuan, Spenser, and Pope produced their works in this\r\nkind. Even here, however, the simple sensuous ideal was too much hampered\r\nby the ungenuine paraphernalia which the conventions of these various\r\nsocieties had gathered round it to take rank among the permanent and\r\ninevitable forms of literary art. This was granted to the lyric alone. It\r\nwas through the lyric that the pastoral ideal and pastoral colouring most\r\ndeeply penetrated and influenced existing forms; for the lyric, the freest\r\nand most unconditioned of all poetical kinds, the least tied to the\r\ncircumstances and limitations of the actual world, was particularly fitted\r\nto extract the fragrance from the pastoral ideal without raising any\r\nunseasonable questions as to its rational or actual possibility.\r\n\r\n    It was a lover and his lass\r\n    That o'er the green cornfield did pass--\r\n\r\nthis is the essential; and we ask no more if we are wise. The very\r\nessence, be it remembered, of the pastoral ideal is no more than 'love\r\n_in vacuo_.' And this the lyric alone can give us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut there is one play which more than any other illustrates the nature of\r\nthe influence exerted by pastoral tradition over the romantic drama and\r\nthe relation subsisting between the two. This is _As You Like It_; for if\r\nin one sense Shakespeare was but following Lodge in the traditional\r\nblending of pastoral elements with those of court and chivalry, in another\r\nsense he has in this play revealed his opinion of, and passed judgement\r\nupon, the whole pastoral ideal. This must necessarily happen whenever a\r\ngreat creative artist adopts, for reasons of his own, and takes into his\r\nwork any merely outward and formal convention. It was rarely that in his\r\nplays Shakespeare showed any inclination to connect himself even remotely\r\nwith pastoral tradition. The _Two Gentlemen of Verona_ traces its origin,\r\nindeed, to the _Diana_ of Montemayor; but all vestige of pastoral\r\ncolouring has vanished, and Shakespeare may even have been himself\r\nignorant of the parentage of the story he treated. A more apparent element\r\nof pastoral found its way many years later into the _Winters Tale_; but it\r\nis characteristic of the shepherd scenes of that play, written in the full\r\nmaturity of Shakespeare's genius, that, in spite of their origin in\r\nGreene's romance of _Pandosto_, they owe nothing of their treatment to\r\npastoral tradition, nothing to convention, nothing to aught save life as\r\nit mirrored itself in the magic glass of the poet's imagination. They\r\nrepresent solely the idealization of Shakespeare's own observation, and in\r\nspite of the marvellous and subtle glamour of golden sunlight that\r\noverspreads the whole, we may yet recognize in them the consummation\r\ntowards which many sketches of natural man and woman, as he found them in\r\nthe English fields and lanes, seem in a less certain and conscious manner\r\nto be striving in plays of an earlier date. It was characteristic of\r\nShakespeare, as it has been of other great artists, to introduce into his\r\nearly writings incidental sketches which serve as studies for further work\r\nof a later period. In much the same manner the varied, but at times\r\nuncertain, melody of the early love comedies seems to aspire towards the\r\nfull sonority and magic of lyric feeling and utterance in _Romeo and\r\nJuliet_.\r\n\r\nThus it is neither to the mellow autumn of his art, when he had cast aside\r\nas unworthy all the trivialities of convention, nor yet to the storm and\r\nstress of adolescence, the immaturity of pettiness and exaggeration, that\r\nwe must look if we would discover Shakespeare's attitude towards pastoral\r\ntradition. _As You Like It_ belongs to his middle period. It will be\r\nremembered, from what has been said on an earlier page, that in this play\r\nShakespeare substantially followed the story of Rosalind as narrated by\r\nLodge, to whom we owe the introduction of a pastoral element into the old\r\ntale of Gamelyn. The pastoral characters of the play may be roughly\r\nanalysed as follows. Celia and Rosalind, the latter disguised as a youth,\r\nare courtly characters; Phebe and Silvius represent the polished Arcadians\r\nof pastoral tradition; while Audrey and William combine the character of\r\nfarcical rustics with the inimitable humanity which distinguishes\r\nShakespeare's creations. It is noteworthy that this last pair is the\r\ndramatist's own addition to the cast. Thus we have all the various\r\ntypes--all the degrees or variations of idealization--brought side by side\r\nand co-existent in the fairyland of the poet's fancy. The details of the\r\nplay are too well known for there to be any call to outrage the delicate\r\ninterweaving of character and incident by translating the perfect scenes\r\ninto clumsy prose. Nor would such analysis throw any light upon\r\nShakespeare's attitude towards pastoral. That must be sought elsewhere. We\r\nmay seek it in the fanciful mingling of ideals and idealizations--of\r\ncourtly masking, of the conventional naturalism of polished dreamers, and\r\nof a rusticity more genuine at once and more sympathetic than that of\r\nLorenzo, all of which act by their very natures as touchstones to one\r\nanother. We may seek it in the uncertainty and hovering between belief and\r\nscepticism, earnest and play, reality and imagination--such as can only\r\nexist in art, or in life when life approaches to the condition of an\r\nart--which we find in the scenes where Orlando courts his mistress in the\r\nperson of the youth who is but his mistress in disguise. We may seek it\r\nlastly in the manner in which the firm structure of the piece is\r\nfashioned of the non-pastoral elements; in the happiness of the art by\r\nwhich the pastoral incidents and business appear but as so much fair and\r\ngraceful ornament upon this structure, bringing with them a smack of the\r\nfree, rude, countryside, or a faint perfume of the polished Utopia of\r\ncourtly makers. It is here that we may trace Shakespeare's appreciation of\r\npastoral, as a delicate colouring, an old-world fragrance, a flower from\r\nwild hedgerows or cultured garden, a thing of grace and beauty, to be\r\ngathered, enjoyed, and forgotten, unsuited in its evanescent charm to be\r\nthe serious business of art or life.\r\n\r\nOn this note, the realization at once of the delicate loveliness and of\r\nthe unsubstantiality of the pastoral ideal, we may close our survey of its\r\ngrowth and blossoming in our dramatic literature, and before finally\r\nturning from the tradition which fascinated so many generations of\r\nEuropean artists, pause for one moment to inquire of the critical\r\nexpression it has received at the hands of more philosophical writers.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how in the early days of modern pastoral composition\r\nBoccaccio, summing up the previous history of the kind, found in allegory\r\nand topical allusion its _raison d'être_. We have seen how in our own\r\ntongue Drayton expressed a similar view, and how Fletcher adopted in\r\ntheory at least a more naturalistic position. This antagonism which runs\r\nthrough the whole of pastoral theory is really dependent upon two\r\nquestions which have not always been clearly distinguished. There is,\r\nnamely, the question of the allegorical or topical interpretation of the\r\npoems, and there is the question of the rusticity or at least simplicity\r\nof the form and language. It is possible to advocate the introduction of\r\nBoccaccio's 'nonnulli sensus' and yet demand that, whatever the esoteric\r\ninterpretation of which the poem may be capable, the outward expression\r\nshall be appropriate to the apparent condition of the speakers; while on\r\nthe other hand it is possible to confine the meaning to the evident and\r\nunsophisticated sense of the poem, while allowing such a degree of\r\nidealization in the language and sentiments of the characters as to\r\ndifferentiate them widely from the actual rustics of real life. The former\r\nof these positions is that assumed by Spenser in the _Shepherd's\r\nCalender_, however much he may have failed in logical consistency; the\r\nsecond is that which, in spite of much incidental matter of a topical\r\nnature, underlies Tasso's masterpiece in the kind. It is with the second\r\nof the above questions that critics have in the main been concerned. They\r\nhave, namely, as a rule, tacitly though not explicitly recognized the fact\r\nthat a poem whose value depends exclusively upon an esoteric\r\ninterpretation has no meaning whatever as a work of art, while if artistic\r\nvalue can be assigned to the primary meaning of the work, it is a matter\r\nof indifference aesthetically whether there be an esoteric interpretation\r\nor not.\r\n\r\nEvery writer, I think, who comes within the limits of pastoral as usually\r\nunderstood, has found a certain idealization and a certain refinement\r\nnecessary in bringing rustic swains into the domain of art. That any such\r\nprocess is inherently necessary to produce an artistic result there is no\r\nreason whatever to suppose; it may even be rationally questioned whether\r\nit is necessary to ensure the result falling within the recognizable field\r\nof pastoral; but neither of these considerations affects the historical\r\nfact. It is commonly admitted that among pastoral writers Theocritus\r\nadhered most closely to nature; yet no one has been found to describe him\r\nas a realist, whether in method or intention. But though this process of\r\nidealization is practically universal, few poets have confessed to it.\r\nOnly occasionally an author, writing according to the demands of his age\r\nor of his individual taste, has been alive to what appeared to be a\r\ncontradiction between his creations and what he mistook for the\r\nfundamental conditions of the kind in which he created. This was the case\r\nwith Tasso, and he sought to reconcile the two by making Amore in the\r\nprologue declare:\r\n\r\n    Spirerò nobil sensi a' rozzi petti,\r\n    Raddolcirò nelle lor lingue il suono,\r\n    Perche, ovunque i' mi sia, io sono Amore,\r\n    Ne' pastori non men, che negli eroi;\r\n    E la disagguaglianza de' soggetti,\r\n    Come a me piace, agguaglio.\r\n\r\nThis served, of course, no other purpose than to salve the author's\r\nartistic conscience, since it is perfectly evident that the polished\r\ncivility of his characters belongs to them by nature, and is not in any\r\nway an external importation. The remark, however, is interesting in\r\nrespect of the philosophy of love as a civilizing power, which we have\r\nseen constantly recurring from the days of Boccaccio onward. Ben Jonson\r\nexpressed himself sharply on this subject, with respect to Guarini and\r\nSidney, in his conversations with Drummond. 'That Guarini, in his Pastor\r\nFido, keept not decorum, in making Shepherds speek as well as himself\r\ncould.... That Sidney did not keep a decorum in making everyone speak as\r\nwell as himself.'[359] The critical foundation of these censures in an _a\r\npriori_ definition of pastoral is obvious, and they are more interesting\r\nfor their authorship than for their intrinsic merit. It would be curious\r\nto know how Jonson defended such a character as his Sad Shepherd--but his\r\nviews had time to alter.\r\n\r\nIt is to the critics of the late years of the seventeenth century and\r\nearly ones of the eighteenth that we owe the attempt to formulate a theory\r\nof pastoral composition. The attempt has not for us any great importance.\r\nAll the work we have been considering had appeared, and the vast majority\r\nof it had passed into oblivion, before the French critics first engaged\r\nupon the task. Nor has the attempt much intrinsic interest. The theories\r\nof individual writers such as those already mentioned are of value, as\r\nshowing the critical mood in which they themselves created; but these, and\r\nstill more the theories of pure critics, are of no importance, either in\r\nthe field of abstract critical theory or of historical inquiry.\r\nFontenelle, offended at the odour of Theocritus' hines, Rapin, with his\r\nJesuitical prudicity and ethico-literary theories of propriety, are not\r\nthe kind of thinkers to advance critical and historical science. Yet it\r\nwas to their school that the far greater English critics of the early\r\neighteenth century belonged. Their work consists for the most part of\r\nvarious combinations of _a priori_ definition and arbitrary rules, based\r\non the notion of propriety. Thus Pope in the _Discourse on Pastoral_,\r\nprefixed to his eclogues in 1717, writes: 'A pastoral is an imitation of\r\nthe action of a shepherd, or one considered under that character.... If we\r\nwould copy nature, it may be useful to take this idea along with us, that\r\npastoral is an image of what they call the golden age. So that we are not\r\nto describe our shepherds as shepherds at this day really are, but as they\r\nmay be conceived then to have been, when the best of men followed the\r\nemployment.' Shallow formalism this; but what else was to be expected from\r\nAlexander Pope at the age of sixteen? His contemporaries, however, and\r\nsuccessors down to Johnson, took his solemn vacuity in all seriousness.\r\nSteele, writing in the _Guardian_ in 1713 (Nos. 22, &c.), follows much the\r\nsame lines. He speaks of 'Innocence, Simplicity, and whatever else has\r\nbeen laid down as distinguishing Marks of Pastoral.' Again, the reader is\r\ninformed that 'Whoever can bear these'--namely, certain _concetti_ from\r\nTasso and Guarini--'may be assured he hath no Taste for Pastoral.' We find\r\nthe same pedantic and ignorant objections to Sannazzaro's piscatorials as\r\nwere later advanced by Johnson: 'who can pardon him,' loftily queries the\r\ncensor, 'for his Arbitrary Change of the sweet Manners and pleasing\r\nobjects of the Country, for what in their own Nature are uncomfortable and\r\ndreadful?' An afternoon's idling along the cliffs of Sorento or the shore\r\nof Posilipo will supply a sufficient answer to such ignorant conceit as\r\nthis. Lastly, in the same familiar strain, but with all the pompous weight\r\nof undisputed dictatorship, we find Dr. Johnson a generation later laying\r\ndown in the _Rambler_ that a pastoral is 'a Poem in which any action or\r\nPassion is represented by its Effects upon a Country Life.... In Pastoral,\r\nas in other Writings, Chastity of sentiment ought doubtless to be\r\nobserved, and Purity of Manners to be represented; not because the Poet is\r\nconfined to the Images of the golden Age'--this is a rap at Pope--'but\r\nbecause, having the subject in his own Choice, he ought always to consult\r\nthe Interest of Virtue.' The one fixed idea which runs throughout these\r\ncriticisms is that pastoral in its nature somehow is, or should be, other\r\nthan what it is in fact[360].\r\n\r\nThis is a view which very rightly meets with small mercy at the hands of\r\nthe modern historical school of criticism. A last fragment of the hoary\r\nfallacy may be traced in Dr. Sommer's remark: 'Die Theorie des\r\nHirtengedichtes ist kurz in folgenden Worten ausgedrückt: schlichte und\r\nungekünstelte Darstellung des Hirtenlebens und wahre Naturschilderung.' It\r\ncannot be too emphatically laid down that there is and can be no such\r\nthing as a 'theory' of pastoral, or, indeed, of any other artistic form\r\ndependent, like it, upon what are merely accidental conditions.[361] As I\r\nstarted by pointing out at the beginning of this work, pastoral is not\r\ncapable of definition by reference to any essential quality; whence it\r\nfollows that any theory of pastoral is not a theory of pastoral as it\r\nexists, but as the critic imagines that it ought to exist. 'Everything is\r\nwhat it is, and not another thing,' and pastoral is what the writers of\r\npastoral have made it.\r\n\r\nIt may be convenient before closing this chapter to summarize briefly the\r\nresults of our inquiry into the history of pastoral tradition on the\r\npre-restoration stage in England, without the elaboration of detail and\r\nthe many necessary though minor distinctions unavoidable in the foregoing\r\naccount. We saw, in the first place, that the idea of a literature dealing\r\nwith the humours and romance of farm and sheepcot was not wholly alien to\r\nnational English literature; but, on the contrary, that the shepherd plays\r\nof the religions cycles, the popular ballads, and a few of the Scots poets\r\nof the time of Henryson, all alike furnish verse which may be regarded as\r\nthe index of the readiness of the popular mind to receive the\r\nintroduction of a formal pastoral tradition. Next, preceding, as in Italy,\r\nthe introduction or evolution of a regular pastoral drama, we find a\r\nseries of mythological plays embodying incidentally elements of pastoral,\r\nwritten for the amusement of court circles, and founded on the\r\n_Metamorphoses_ of Ovid. In these the nature of the pastoral scenes appear\r\nto be conditioned, in so far as they are independent of their classical\r\nsource, partly by the already existing eclogue, and partly perhaps by the\r\nnative impulse mentioned above[362]. All this anticipates the rise of the\r\npastoral drama proper. The foreign pastoral tradition reached England\r\nthrough three main channels. The earliest of these, the eclogue, was\r\nimitated by Spenser from Marot, who, while depending somewhat more\r\nclosely, perhaps, than was usual upon the ancients, and adding to his work\r\na certain original flavour, yet belonged essentially to the tradition of\r\nthe allegorical pastoral which took its fashion from the works of Petrarch\r\nand Mantuan. The second, and for the English drama vastly the more\r\nimportant channel, was the pastoral-chivalric romance borrowed by Sidney\r\nfrom Montemayor, the great exponent of the Spanish school, which was,\r\nhowever, based upon the Italian work of Sannazzaro. The third was the\r\nArcadian drama of the Ferrarese court, which was imitated, chiefly from\r\nGuarini, by Samuel Daniel. Thus, of the three forms, verse, prose, and\r\ndrama, adopted by England from Italy, the first came by way of France, the\r\nsecond by way of Spain, while the third alone was taken direct[363]. These\r\nthree blended with the pre-existing mythological play, and with the\r\ntraditions of the romantic drama generally, to produce the pastoral drama\r\nof the English stage. The influence ot the eclogue was on the whole\r\nslight, but to it we may reasonably ascribe a share of the topical and\r\nallusive elements, when these do not appear assignable either to the\r\nArcadian drama or to masque literature generally.[364] The influence of\r\nthe mythological drama, again, is not of the first importance, and is also\r\nvery restricted in its occurrence; the _Maid's Metamorphosis_ is the most\r\nstriking example. The three main influences at work in fashioning the\r\npastoral drama upon the English stage were, therefore, the Arcadian drama\r\nof Italy, the Sidneian romance borrowed from Spain, and the native\r\ntradition of the romantic drama.[365] But we have seen that the most\r\nimportant examples of dramatic pastoral in this country, though to some\r\nextent conditioned like the rest by the above-mentioned influences, were\r\nthe outcome of direct and conscious experiment. In part, at least, the\r\nearliest, and by far the most simple, was the work of Samuel Daniel\r\nhimself, which aimed at nothing beyond the mere transference of the\r\nItalian tradition unaltered on to the English stage. A different aim\r\nunderlay the attempts alike of Fletcher and Randolph; the combination,\r\nnamely, of the traditions of the Arcadian and romantic dramas. This common\r\nend they sought, however, by very diverse means. Fletcher, while adopting\r\nthe machinery and methods of the popular drama, left the ideal and\r\nimaginary content practically untouched, and even chose a plot which in\r\nits structure resembled those familiar in the romantic drama even less\r\nthan did Guarini's own. Randolph, on the other hand, while preserving much\r\nof the classical mechanism as he found it in Guarini, altered the whole\r\ntone and character of the piece to correspond to the greater complexity of\r\ninterest, more genial humour, and more genuine romanticism of the English\r\nstage. Lastly, we found Jonson cutting himself almost entirely adrift from\r\nthe tradition of Italian Arcadianism, and seeking to create an essentially\r\nnational pastoral by the combination of shepherd lads and girls,\r\ntransmuted from actuality by a natural process of refinement akin to that\r\nof Theocritus, with the magic and fairy lore of popular fancy, and with\r\nthe characters of Robin and Marian and all the essentially English\r\ntradition of Sherwood. These three chief experiments in the production of\r\nan English pastoral drama which should rival that of Italy stand, together\r\nwith Daniel's two plays, apart from the general run of pieces of the kind.\r\nIt is also worth notice that they are all alike unaffected by the Sidneian\r\nromance. The remaining plays which form the great bulk of the contribution\r\nmade by English drama to pastoral, and among which we must look for such\r\ndramatic pastoral tradition as existed, are almost all characterized by a\r\nmore or less prevalent court atmosphere, disguisings and adventures in\r\nshepherd's garb forming the mainstay of the plot, while the genuine\r\npastoral elements supply little beyond the background of the action.\r\n\r\nInto the post-restoration pastorals it is no part of my present scheme to\r\nenter. They flourished for a while under the wing of the fashionable\r\nromance of France, but were almost more than their predecessors the things\r\nof artificial convention, having their form and being in a world whose\r\nonly pre-occupations were the pangs and transports of sensibility. They\r\noccupy by right a small corner in the _Carte du Tendre_. Nor do I propose\r\nto do more than allude in passing to Allan Ramsay's _Gentle Shepherd_. In\r\nspite of the almost unvarying praise which has been lavished upon this\r\n'Scots pastoral,' and even though the characters may have some points of\r\nhumanity in common with actual Lothian rustics, the whole composition of\r\nthe piece can scarcely be pronounced less artificial than that of the\r\nArcadian drama itself, and the play has undoubtedly shared in the\r\nexaggerated esteem which has fallen to the lot of dialectal literature\r\ngenerally. The tradition lingered on throughout the eighteenth and into\r\nthe nineteenth century. Goethe in his youth, while under the French\r\ninfluence, composed the _Laune des Verliebten_, and in his later days at\r\nWeimar the _Fischerin_, a piscatorial adapted for representation on an\r\nopen-air stage, in which the interest was purely spectacular. As a general\r\nrule, however, pastoral inanity seldom strayed beyond the limits of the\r\nopera.\r\n\r\nThat the pastoral should flourish by the side of the romantic drama was\r\nnot to be expected. It was impossible in England, as it was impossible in\r\nSpain. In either case it might now and again achieve a mild success at\r\ncourt, or under some exceptional conditions of representation; it never\r\nheld the popular stage. No literature based on the accidents of a special\r\nform of civilization, or upon a set of artificially imagined conditions,\r\ncan ever hope to outlive the civilization or the fashion that gave it\r\nbirth. 'Love _in vacuo_' failed to arouse the interest of general mankind.\r\nEvery literature of course wears the livery of its age, but where the body\r\nbeneath is instinct with human life it can change its dress and pass\r\nunchanged itself from one order of things to another; where the livery is\r\nall, the form cannot a second time be galvanized into life. Pastoral,\r\nrelying for its distinctive features upon the accidents rather than the\r\nessentials of life, failed to justify its pretentions as a serious and\r\nindependent form of art. The trivial toy of a courtly coterie, it\r\nattempted to arrogate to itself the position of a philosophy, and in so\r\ndoing exposed itself to the ridicule of succeeding ages. Men with a stern\r\npurpose in life turned wearily from the sickly amours of romantic poets\r\nwho dreamed that human happiness found its place in the economy of the\r\nworld. They left it to a rout of melodious idlers to imagine unto\r\nthemselves a state in which serious importance should attach to the\r\ngracious things of sentiment and the loves of youth and maiden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAddenda\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPage 19.--Even apart from the evidence of the _Bucolica Quirinalium_, it\r\nis, of course, clear that Vergil's eclogues were familiar to the writers\r\nof the early middle ages. How far their interest in them was literary, and\r\nhow far, like that of the mystery-writers, it was theological, may,\r\nhowever, be questioned. It is worth noticing in this connexion that a\r\nGerman translation was projected by no less a person than Notker, and\r\nsince they are coupled by him with the _Andria_, we may reasonably infer\r\nthat in this case at least the writer's concern, if not distinctively\r\nliterary, was at any rate educational. (See W. P. Ker, _The Dark Ages_, p.\r\n317.)\r\n\r\nPage 112, note 2.--There is an error here. _The Passionate Pilgrim_\r\nversion of 'As it fell upon a day' does not contain the couplet found in\r\n_England's Helicon_. I was misled by its being supplied from the latter by\r\nthe Cambridge editors. Another poem of the same description appears in\r\nFrancis Sabie's _Pan's Pipe_. (See Sidney Lee's introduction to the Oxford\r\nPress facsimile of the _Passionate Pilgrim_, p. 31.)\r\n\r\nPage 204.--It is perhaps hardly surprising to find Tasso's 'S' ei piace,\r\nei lice' quoted by English writers as summing up the cynical philosophy of\r\nthose whom they not unaptly styled 'politicians.' In Marston's tragedy on\r\nthe story of Sophonisba, for instance, the villain Syphax concludes a\r\n'Machiavellian' speech with the words:\r\n\r\n    For we hold firm, that 's lawful which doth please.\r\n                    (_Wonder of Women_, IV. i. 191.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix I\r\n\r\nOn the Origin and Development of the Italian Pastoral Drama\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chapter in the history of Italian literature which shall deal with the\r\nevolution of the Arcadian drama still remains to be written. The treatment\r\nof it in Symonds' _Renaissance_ is decidedly inadequate, and even as far\r\nas it goes not altogether satisfactory. The explanation of this is, that\r\nthe most important works fall outside his period; the _Aminta_ and the\r\n_Pastor fido_ are admirably treated in the volumes dealing with the\r\ncounter-reformation, but these are of the nature of an appendix, and\r\nformed no part of his original plan. Tiraboschi's account is also meagre.\r\nA long discussion of the subject will be found in the fifth volume of J.\r\nL. Klein's _Geschichte des Dramas_ (Leipzig, 1867), but the bewildering\r\nirrelevancy of much of the matter introduced by that eccentric writer\r\nseriously impairs the critical value of his work. An excellent sketch of\r\nthe early history as far as Beccari, with full references, is given in\r\nVittorio Rossi's valuable monograph, _Battista Guarini ed il Pastor Fido_\r\n(Torino, 1886), pt. ii. ch. i. This has the immense advantage of\r\nconciseness, and of a clear and scholarly style. An important review of\r\nRossi's book, concerning itself particularly with the chapter in question,\r\nappeared in the _Literaturblatt für germanische und romanische Philologie_\r\nfor 1891 (col. 376), from the pen of A. L. Stiefel, who incidentally\r\nannounced that he was himself engaged on a comprehensive history of the\r\npastoral drama. Of this work I have been unable to obtain any further\r\ninformation. Next an elaborate essay by the veteran Giosuè Carducci,\r\nlargely combatting Rossi's conclusions as to the literary evolution of the\r\nform, and bringing forward a good deal of fresh evidence, appeared in the\r\n_Nuova Antologia_ for September, 1894, and was reprinted with additions\r\nand corrections as the second of three papers in the author's pamphlet _Su\r\nl'Aminta di T. Tasso_ (Firenze, 1896). To this Rossi rejoined, effectively\r\nas it seems to me, in the _Giornale storico della letteratura italiana_\r\n(1898, xxxi. p. 108). The treatment in W. Creizenach's _Geschichte des\r\nneueren Dramas_ (Halle, 1901, ii. p. 359) is unfortunately not yet\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nThe theory of development which I have adopted is substantially that\r\nelaborated by Rossi. To him belongs the honour of having been the first\r\nclearly to indicate the historical steps by which the eclogue passes into\r\nthe drama. The idea, however, was not original; it underlies the accounts\r\ngiven by Egidio Menagio in the notes to his edition of the _Aminta_\r\n(Paris, 1655), by G. Fontanini (_Aminta difeso_, Roma, 1700, and Venezia,\r\n1730), by P. L. Ginguené (_Histoire littéraire d'Italie,_ vol. vi, Paris,\r\n1813), and by Klein. It was also virtually accepted by Stiefel in his\r\nreview of Rossi, since he confined his criticism to pointing out and\r\nattempting to fill occasional gaps in the sequence of development, and to\r\ninsisting on the influence of the regular drama, and more particularly of\r\nthe Intronati comedy. The incomplete state of Creizenach's work, and the\r\ncaution with which he expresses himself on the subject, preclude our\r\nreckoning him among the declared supporters of the theory; but there can\r\nbe little doubt, I think, as to the tendency of his remarks. This may then\r\nbe regarded as the orthodox view. It has not, however, received the\r\nexclusive adherence of scholars, and it may therefore be thought right\r\nthat I should both give in detail the arguments by which it is supported\r\nand my reasons for accepting it, and likewise state the grounds on which I\r\nreject the rival theories that have been propounded.\r\n\r\nTwo of these latter may be quickly dismissed. These are the views put\r\nforward respectively by Gustav Weinberg, _Das französische Schäferspiel in\r\nder ersten Hälfte des XVIIten Jahrhunderts_ (Frankfurt, 1884), and by J.\r\nG. Schönherr in his _Jorge de Montemayor_ (Halle, 1886). Weinberg finds\r\nthe origin of the Italian pastoral drama in the 'Éclogas' of Juan del\r\nEncina. With regard to this theory it may be sufficient to observe that,\r\nat the time Encina wrote, the _ecloga rappresentativa_, or dramatic\r\neclogue, was already familiar in the Italian courts, and that, so far from\r\nhis writings being the source of any pastoral tradition even in his own\r\ncountry, what subsequent dramatic work of the kind is to be found in Spain\r\nmerely represents a further borrowing from Italy. Schönherr, on the other\r\nhand, regards the _Jus Robins et Marion_ as the source of the Arcadian\r\ndrama. Not only, however, did Adan de le Hale's play fail to originale any\r\ndramatic tradition in its own country, but it is itself nothing but an\r\namplified _pastourelle_, a form which, in spite of marked Provençal\r\ninfluence, never obtained to any extent in Italy. It need hardly be said\r\nthat there is not a vestige of historical evidence to support either of\r\nthese theories[366].\r\n\r\nIt is different with the theory advanced by Carducci in the essay already\r\nmentioned. The reputation of the great Italian critic would alone entitle\r\nany view he advanced to the most respectful consideration. In the present\r\ncase, however, there is more than this, for his essay is a monument of\r\ndeep and loving scholarship, and whether we agree or not with its\r\nconclusions, it adds greatly to our knowledge of the subject. Briefly and\r\nbaldly stated, his contention is as follows. The Arcadian drama was a\r\ncreation of the literary and courtly circles of Ferrara, and so far as\r\nItaly is concerned the precursors of the _Aminta_ are to be sought in\r\nBeccari's _Sacrifizio_ and Giraldi Cintio's _Egle_ alone, with a\r\nconnecting link as it were supplied by the pastoral fragment of the latter\r\nauthor, first printed as an appendix to the essay in question. Beyond\r\nthese compositions no influence can be traced, except that of a study of\r\nthe classics in general, and of Theocritus in particular. It is certainly\r\nremarkable that the important texts mentioned above, as well as Argenti's\r\n_Sfortunato_ and the _Aminta_ itself, should all alike have been written\r\nfor and produced at the court of the Estensi at Ferrara. The selection,\r\nhowever, I regard as somewhat arbitrary. The _Egle_ appears to lie\r\nentirely off the road of pastoral development, and I cannot help thinking\r\nthat Carducci falls into the not unnatural error of exaggerating the\r\nimportance of the interesting document he was the first to publish. The\r\nprimitive dramatic eclogue was not altogether unknown at Ferrara, nor do\r\nthe pastoral shows elsewhere appear to have been always as remote from the\r\ncourtly grace of the Arcadian tradition as the critic is at pains to\r\ndemonstrate. In view therefore of the practically unbroken line of formal\r\ndevelopment, and the consistency of artistic aim observable from\r\nSannazzaro in the last quarter of the fifteenth to Guarini in the last\r\nquarter of the sixteenth century, I find it impossible to accept\r\nCarducci's conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of the orthodox theory, however, must be prepared to meet\r\nand combat the objections which Carducci has raised, and which, in his\r\nopinion, necessitate the adoption of a different explanation. The\r\nevolution of the pastoral drama from the eclogue he declares to be\r\nimpossible, in the first place, on historical grounds. This objection\r\nrelates to the evidence as to a continuous development traceable in the\r\naccessible texts, and to it the account given in the following pages\r\nwill--or will not--be found a sufficient answer. In the second place, he\r\ndeclares it to be impossible on aesthetic grounds. These are three in\r\nnumber, and may be briefly considered here. (_a_) 'Idealization cannot\r\ndevelop out of caricature.' Here, I presume, he is using 'caricature' in\r\nits technical sense of what Aristotle calls 'imitation worse than nature,'\r\nnot merely for the resuit of an inadequate command over the medium of\r\nartistic μίμησις. The remark, therefore, can only apply to the 'rustic'\r\nproductions. But, as Aristotle's phrase suggests, burlesque, or\r\ncaricature, is only idealization in a different direction, so that there\r\nappears to be less antagonism between the two tendencies than might at\r\nfirst be supposed. Moreover, no one has suggested that the rustic shows\r\nwere the origin of the Arcadian drama, so that it is to be presumed that\r\nCarducci had in mind the more or less frequent but still sporadic elements\r\nborrowed by the eclogues from the popular drama. These, however, are found\r\nin conjunction with idealized elements of courtly tradition, both in the\r\ndramatic eclogues themselves and more especially in the _ecloghe\r\nmaggiaiuole_ or May-day shows of the Congrega dei Rozzi. Thus, although it\r\nis true that we should not expect idealization to be evolved out of\r\ncaricature, there is no reason to deny its evolution from a form in which\r\nburlesque and romance subsisted side by side. (_b_) 'Those eclogues that\r\nare not burlesque are occasional compositions equally incapable of\r\ndeveloping into the Arcadian drama.' Though, no doubt, usually written for\r\npresentation upon some particular occasion, several of the dramatic\r\neclogues present no topical features. Nor does it appear why a form of\r\ncomposition, the type of which was fairly constant although the individual\r\nexamples might be ephemeral enough, should not develop into something of a\r\nmore permanent nature. Moreover, the topical allusions scattered\r\nthroughout the _Aminta_, as well as the highly occasional character of the\r\nprologue to the _Pastor fido_, serve to connect these plays directly with\r\nthe 'occasional' eclogue. (_c_) The metrical form of the recognized\r\ndramatic pastorals differs from that of the eclogues.' While beginning,\r\nhowever, with simple _terza_ or _ottava rima_, the dramatic eclogue\r\ngradually became highly polymetric in structure, though it is true that it\r\nseldom affected the free measures peculiar to the Arcadian drama. These,\r\nhowever, were no more suited to short compositions than the stiff terzines\r\nand octaves to more complicated dramatic works. The prevalent metre, as\r\nindeed many other points, might well be borrowed by the dramatic pastoral\r\nfrom the practice of the regular stage without it thereby ceasing to be\r\nthe formal descendant of the eclogue.\r\n\r\nAnother point in debate is the view taken of the question by contemporary\r\ncritics--that is, by Guarini and his adversaries. Rossi pointed out a\r\npassage in Guarini's _Veraio_ of 1588[367] which he held to support his\r\ntheory of development. Translated, the passage runs: 'And why should it\r\nnot be thought lawful for the eclogue to grow out of its infancy and\r\narrive at mature years, if this has been possible in the case of tragedy?\r\n... Even as the Muses grafted tragedy upon the dithyrambic stock, and\r\ncomedy upon the phallic, so in their ever-fertile garden they set the\r\neclogue as a tiny cutting, whence sprang in later years the stately growth\r\nof the pastoral,' that is, of the _favola di pastori_, or dramatic\r\npastoral, as he elsewhere explains. 'But in thèse words,' objects\r\nCarducci, 'the writer is in no way referring to the Italian eclogues of\r\nthe fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The eclogue had passed out of its\r\ninfancy in the work of Theocritus.' Here, however, Carducci appears to me\r\nto misinterpret Guarini's meaning in an almost perverse manner. The\r\nmetaphoric 'infancy' of which Guarini speaks is the pre-dramatic period of\r\npastoral growth. No one will deny that the Theocritean idyl had attained\r\nfull and perfect development in its own kind; but from the dramatic point\r\nof view, and granted that it contained the germ of the later pastoral\r\ndrama, it belonged to a period of infancy, or, to adopt a more strictly\r\naccurate metaphor, of gestation. Were further evidence needed to show that\r\nthe allusion is to the Italian rather than to the classical eclogue, it\r\nmight be found in the fact that the passage in question was Guarini's\r\nanswer to the following criticism of De Nores, as to the meaning of which\r\nthere can be no two opinions. Attacking the pastoral tragi-comedy, the\r\ncritic remarks: 'Until the other day similar compositions were represented\r\nunder the name of eclogues at festivals and banquets, ... but now of a\r\nsudden they have been fashioned of the extension of comedies and tragedies\r\nin five acts[368].' It will be noticed that in his reply Guarini makes no\r\nattempt to question the underlying identity of the pastoral tragi-comedy\r\nwith the dramatic eclogue, but contents himself with very justly asserting\r\nthe right of the latter to develop into a mature literary form. Two other\r\npassages from Guarini have been quoted as germane to the discussion. They\r\noccur in the _Verato secondo_, written as a counterblast to De Nores'\r\n_Apologia_,[369]. One may be rendered thus: 'Although the dramatic\r\npastoral, in respect of the characters introduced, recognizes its ultimate\r\norigin in the eclogue and in the satire [i. e. the satyric drama] of the\r\nancients, nevertheless, in respect of its form and ordinance it may be\r\nsaid to be a modern kind of poetry, seeing that no example of such\r\ndramatic composition, whether Greek or Latin, is to be found in ancient\r\ntimes.' The other runs: 'having regard to the fact that Theocritus stepped\r\nbeyond the number of persons usual in similar poems, and composed one [the\r\n_Feast of Adonis_] which not only contains many interlocutors, but is of a\r\nmore dramatic character than usual, and remarkable also for its greater\r\nlength; it seemed to him [Beccari] that he might with great honour supply\r\nthat kind neglected by the Greek and Latin authors[370].' In the former of\r\nthese passages Guarini, while recognizing the community of subject-matter\r\nbetween the classical eclogue and the renaissance pastoral drama, claims\r\nthat as an artistic form the latter is independent of the former. Nor is\r\nthis inconsistent with what he says in the subsequent passage, for it is\r\nperfectly true that it was with Beccari that the pastoral first attained\r\nits full complexity of dramatic structure, and his allusion to Theocritus\r\nmeans, not that he regarded him as the father of the form, but that, after\r\nthe manner of a _cinquecento_ critic, he is seeking for authority at least\r\namong the ancients where direct precedent is not to be found. His\r\nreference to the evolution of classical tragedy and comedy in the passage\r\ncited from his first essay shows clearly that he had in mind a process of\r\ngradual and natural development, not one of definite borrowing or\r\nartificial creation.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me, therefore, that Carducci has erred in not taking a\r\nsufficiently broad view of the lines on which literary development\r\nproceeds; and also, more specifically, in failing to recognize the\r\nimportance of the distinction between the ordinary and the dramatic\r\neclogue. This distinction, though on the scanty evidence extant it is\r\nextremely hard to draw it with any degree of certainty, appears to me a\r\nvital point in the history of the species. The value of Carducci's work\r\nlies in his insistence on the influence of the regular drama, to which,\r\nperhaps on account of its very obviousness, Rossi had failed to attach\r\nsufficient importance; in his directing attention to the local Ferrarese\r\ntradition; in the admirable energy and patience with which he has\r\ncollected all available evidence; and in his reprinting the interesting\r\npastoral fragment of Giraldi Cintio. For these he deserves the warmest\r\nthanks of all students of Italian literature; for my own part I need only\r\nrefer the reader to the footnotes to the following pages as indicating in\r\nsome measure the extent of my indebtedness[371].\r\n\r\nThe theatrical tendency first exhibited itself in the mere recitation of\r\na dialogue in character, and the earliest examples of these _ecloghe\r\nrappresentative_ are identical in form with those written merely for\r\nliterary circulation. For the dates of these external evidence\r\nunfortunately fails us almost entirely, but a fairly well-marked sequence\r\nmay be established on the grounds of internal development. Roughly, they\r\nmust fall within a few years of the close of the fifteenth century, say\r\nbetween 1480 and 1510. They are commonly of an allegorical nature,\r\ncontaining allusions to real persons, and are for the most part composed\r\nin _terza rima_, diversified in the more complex examples by the\r\nintroduction of octaves and lyrical measures[372]. Of this primitive form\r\nis a poem by the Genoese Baldassare Taccone, bearing the superscription\r\n'Ecloga pastorale rapresentata nel Convivio dell' III. Sig'r. Io. Adorno,\r\nnella quale si celebra l' amor del Co. di Cayace [Francesco Sanseverino] e\r\ndi M. Chiara di Marino nuncupata la Castagnini[373].' This piece, in which\r\nthe characters represent real persons, is a mere dialogue without any\r\nsemblance of action. Aminta questions his fellow-shepherd Fileno as to the\r\ncause of his melancholy, and learns that it arises from his hopeless\r\npassion for a certain cruel nymph. His offer to undertake his friend's\r\ncure is met with the declaration, that of the two death were preferable.\r\nSimilar in simplicity of construction is another poem, the work of\r\nSerafino Aquilano, which deals with the corruption of the Church, and was\r\nperformed at Rome during the carnival of 1490[374]. An advance in\r\ndramatization is made by an eclogue of Galeotto Del Carretto's, written in\r\n1492, in honour of the newly elected Alexander VI, in that one character\r\nenters upon the scene after the other has been discoursing for some time;\r\nwhile another, the work of Gualtiero Sanvitale, contains three speakers,\r\nof whom one enters towards the close, and is called upon to decide between\r\nthe other two. This arbiter is none other than Lodovico Sforza\r\nhimself[375]. So far the eclogues have all been in Sannazzaro's _terza\r\nrima_. A wider range of metrical effect, including not only terzines both\r\n_sdrucciole_ and _piane_, but also hendecasyllables with internal rime and\r\na _canzone_, and at the same time a more dramatic treatment, is found in\r\nanother eclogue of Aquilano's[376]. In this Palemone sends his herdsman\r\nSilvano to inspect his flocks after a stormy night. The herdsman meets\r\nIrcano in a melancholy mood, who when questioned endeavours to hide the\r\nnature of his grief by feigning that he has lost his flock in the storm.\r\nAt that moment, however, the real cause of his sorrow enters in the shape\r\nof a nymph, and Ircano leaves Silvano in order to follow her with prayers\r\nand supplications. Silvano endeavours to dissuade him from his love, but\r\nmeets with the usual want of success. In the case of this piece, as also\r\nof the two preceding ones, we have no direct evidence of any\r\nrepresentation, but all three, and especially the last, have the\r\nappearance of being composed for recitation. Another piece, exhibiting an\r\nadvance in complexity of dramatic structure, is an 'ecloga overo\r\npasturale,' a disputation on love by Bernardo Bellincioni[377], apparently\r\nin some way connected with Genoa, in the course of which five characters,\r\nprobably representing actual personages, though we lack external evidence,\r\nforgather upon the stage. The versification again exhibits novel features,\r\nthe piece being for the most part in _ottava rima_ with the introduction\r\nof _settenarî_ couplets. In the former we may perhaps see the influence of\r\nthe _Orfeo_, or possibly of the old _sacre rappresentationi_ themselves.\r\nIn 1506 the court of Urbino witnessed the eclogue composed and recited by\r\nBaldassare Castiglione and Cesare Gonzaga[378]. It also belongs to the\r\noctave group, and is diversified with a canzonet. Dramatically the piece\r\nis somewhat of a retrogression, but it is interesting from the characters\r\nintroduced in pastoral guise. Thus in Iola and Dameta we may see\r\nCastiglione and his fellow author; Tirsi, who gives his name to the poem,\r\nis a stranger shepherd attracted by reports of the court; while among the\r\ncharacters mentioned are discernible Bembo and the Duchess Elizabeth. At\r\nthis point may be mentioned a somewhat similar eclogue found in a Spanish\r\nromance of about 1512, entitled _Cuestion de amor_, descriptive of the\r\nHispano-Neapolitan society of the time. The eclogue, which is clearly\r\nmodelled on the Italian examples, contains five characters, and is\r\nsupposed to represent the love affairs of real personages[379]. Two\r\nso-called 'commedie pastorali,' from which Stiefel hoped for useful\r\nevidence, prove on inspection to be medleys of pastoral amours exhibiting\r\nlittle advance in dramatization, though interesting as showing traces of\r\nthe influence of the not yet fully developed 'rustic' eclogue. They are\r\ncomposed throughout in _terza rima_ without any division into acts or\r\nscenes, and are the work of one Alessandro Caperano of Faenza, thus\r\nhailing, like the later _Amaranta_, from the Romagna[380]. In 1517 we find\r\na fantastic pastoral entitled _Pulicane,_ written in octaves by Piero\r\nAntonio Legacci dello Stricca, a Sienese, who was also the author of\r\nseveral rustic pieces, in which is introduced a monster half dog and half\r\nman. Another work by the same, again in octaves, and entitled _Cicro_,\r\nappeared in 1538. Another piece mentioned by Stiefel as likely to throw\r\nlight on the development of the dramatic pastoral is the 'Ecloga di\r\namicizia' of Bastiano di Francesco, or Bastiano 'the\r\nflax-dresser'(_linaiuolo_), also of Siena, which was first printed in\r\n1523. It turns out, however, to be a decidedly primitive composition in\r\n_terza rima_, with a certain slightly satirical colouring[381].\r\n\r\nIf the texts that have survived are somewhat scanty, there is good reason\r\nto believe that they form but a small portion of the eclogues actually\r\nrepresented at the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncenturies. Thus we find a show, of the nature of which it is not\r\naltogether easy to judge, recorded in a letter by a certain Floriano\r\nDulfo, written from Bologna in July, 1496[382]. It appears to have been a\r\ncomposition of some length, pastoral only in part, supernatural in others,\r\nbut belonging on the whole rather to the cycle of chivalresque romance\r\nthan of classical mythology. In Act I an astrologer announces the birth of\r\na giant, who in Act II is represented as persecuting the shepherds. Acts\r\nIII and IV are occupied by various complaints on his account In Act V,\r\ncalled by Dulfo 'la ultima comedia, overo egloga,' the giant carries off a\r\nnymph while she is gathering flowers; the shepherds, however, come to her\r\nrescue and restore her to her lover. This incident, reminiscent possibly\r\nof the rape of Proserpine, tends to connect the piece with the\r\nmythological tradition. So far as can be gathered, the verse appears to\r\nhave been _ottava rima_ with the introduction of lyrical passages. Again,\r\nwe know that the representation of eclogues formed part of the festivities\r\nat the marriage of Lucrezia Borgia with Giovanni Sforza in 1493, and again\r\nin 1502, when she espoused Alfonzo d' Este. In 1508 the carnival shows at\r\nFerrara included three eclogues, the work respectively of Ercolo Pio,\r\nAntonio dall' Ongano. and Antonio Tebaldeo[383]. At Venice we have note of\r\nsimilar performances, and even find _ecloghe_ mentioned among the forms of\r\ndramatic spectacle recognized by the laws of the state. I may also call\r\nattention in this connexion, and as illustrating the habituai introduction\r\nof acted eclogues in all forms of festival, to the occurrence of such a\r\nperformance in a chivalrous romance by Cassio da Narni, entitled _La morte\r\ndel Danese_[384]. The piece is, however, of the most primitive form, and\r\nmust not be taken as typical of its date, just as the masques introduced\r\ninto the plays of the Elizabethan drama are commonly of a far simpler\r\norder than actually represented at court. It may also not improbably have\r\nbeen influenced by the more popular form of rustic shows, as its\r\ndescription as a 'festa in atti rusticali' would seem to indicate.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the rustic eclogue was developing upon lines of its own, though\r\nrather in arrear of the courtly variety. In 1508 we find a piece in _terza\r\nrima_, exhibiting traces of Paduan dialect, composed or transcribed by one\r\nCesare Nappi of Bologna, in which no less than fourteen 'villani' appear\r\nwith their sweethearts to honour the feast of San Pancrazio[385]. Eating\r\nand dancing form the mainstay of the composition, and since the female\r\ncharacters are described but do not speak, it may be questioned whether\r\nthe piece was intended for representation. Not till five years later have\r\nwe any evidence of a rustic eclogue forming part of an actual show. In\r\n1513, Giuliano de' Medici was at Rome, and in the entertainment provided\r\nat the Capitol on the occasion of his receiving the freedom of the city\r\nwas included an eclogue by a certain 'Blosio,' otherwise Biagio Pallai\r\ndelia Sabina, of the Roman Academy. The argument alone has come down to\r\nus. A rustic, who has first suffered at the hands of the foreign soldiers\r\nthen overrunning Italy, and has afterwards been plundered by the sharper\r\ncitizens of Rome, meets a friend with whom it has fared similarly, and the\r\ntwo determine to seek justice of the Conservators, as a last chance before\r\nretiring to live among the Turks, since a man may not abide in peace in a\r\nChristian land. They find the Capitol _en fête_, and the piece ends with a\r\nsong in praise of Giuliano and Leo X[386]. Of the same year is the 'Egloga\r\npastorale di Justitia,' the earliest extant specimen of the rustic\r\ndramatic eclogue proper. It is a satirical piece concerning a countryman,\r\nwho fails to obtain justice because he is poor. He at last appeals to the\r\nking himself, but is again repulsed because he is accompanied by Truth in\r\nplace of Adulation[387]. This form of composition, recalling as it does\r\nthe allegories of Langland and other satirists of the middle ages, differs\r\nwidely from that usually found in the courtly eclogues, nor is it typical\r\nof rustic representations. Again, to the same year, 1513, belongs an\r\neclogue in rustic speech and Bellunese dialect, by Bartolommeo Cavassico,\r\nwhich like the Roman show turns upon the horrors of the war which had been\r\ndevastating the country since 1508. Recollections of the 'tagliata di\r\nCadore[388]' blend incongruously with fauns, nymphs, bears, pelicans, and\r\nwild men of the woods, to form a whole which appears to be of a decidedly\r\nburlesque character. The distribution, however, of these rustic eclogues\r\nnever appears to have been very wide, and in later times they were chiefly\r\nconfined to the representations of the famous Congrega dei Rozzi at Siena,\r\nthough the activity of this society extended, it is true, far beyond the\r\nlimits of its Tuscan home. Most of these representations, at any rate in\r\nthe earlier years with which we are concerned, were short realistic farces\r\nof low life composed in dialectal verse. Some of the cleverest are by\r\nFrancesco Berni, better known for his obscene _capitoli_ and his\r\n_rifacimento_ of Boiardo's _Orlando_, and appeared between 1537 and 1567;\r\nwhile in later days the kind attained its highest perfection in the work\r\nof Michelangelo Buonarroti the younger, whose _Tancia_ originally appeared\r\nin 1612[389].\r\n\r\nIt may be questioned to what extent these rustic shows influenced the\r\ndevelopment of the pastoral eclogue. Their recognition as a dramatic form\r\nwas subsequent to that of the _ecloga rappresentativa_, and no element\r\ntraceable to their influence can be shown to exist in the dramatic\r\npastoral as finally evolved. On the other hand, we do undoubtedly meet\r\nwith incidents and characters in the courtly shows which appear to belong\r\nto the style of the popular burlesque. A point of contact between the two\r\ntraditions may be found in the _commedie maggiaiuole_, a sort of May-day\r\nshows also represented by the Rozzi, but of a more idealized character\r\nthan the rustic drama proper. They may, indeed, be regarded as to some\r\nextent at least a parody of the two kinds--the courtly and the popular\r\npastoral--since by combining the two each was made the foil and criticism\r\nof the other. Nymphs and shepherds appear as in the pastoral eclogues, but\r\ntheir loves are interrupted by the incursion of boisterous rustics, who\r\nsubstitute the unchastened instincts and brute force of half-savage boors\r\nfor the delicate wooing and sentimentality of their rivals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe return to the development of the dramatic eclogue in a work of some\r\nimportance as marking an advance both in dramatic construction and\r\nversification. _I due pellegrini[390]_, written not later than 1528, when\r\nthe author, Luigi Tansillo, was a youth of sixteen or seventeen, was\r\ndoubtless produced on some occasion before the court of the Orsini, at\r\nNola, near Naples. It was revived with great pomp ten years later at\r\nMessina, when Don Garcia de Toledo, commander of the Neapolitan fleet,\r\nentertained Antonia Cardona, daughter of the Count of Colisano, for whose\r\nhand he was a suitor[391]. Two shepherds, pilgrims of love, bereft of the\r\nobjects of their affection, the one through death, the other through\r\ninconstancy, meet in a forest and reason of the comparative hardness of\r\ntheir lots. Unable to decide the question, they each resolve to bear the\r\nstrongest possible witness to the depth of their affliction by putting an\r\nend to their lives. At this moment, however, the voice of the dead\r\nmistress is heard from a neighbouring tree, persuading them to relinquish\r\ntheir intentions, reconciling them once more with the world and life, and\r\ndirecting them to join the festivities in the city of Nola. Here for the\r\nfirst time we meet with a pastoral composition of some length pretending\r\nto a dramatic solution, and contrasting with the stationary character of\r\nmost of the eclogues we have been examining in that the change of purpose\r\namong the actors constitutes a sort of περιπέτεια, or _rivolgimento_. The\r\npiece is likewise important from a metrical point of view, since it not\r\nonly contains a free intermixture of _ottava_ and _terza rima_, and\r\nhendecasyllables with _rimalmezzo_, a favourite verse form in certain\r\nkinds of composition[392], but likewise foreshadows, in its mingling of\r\nfreely riming hendecasyllables with _settenarî_, the peculiar measures of\r\nthe pastoral drama proper. _I due pellegrini_ was not, however, an\r\naltogether original composition. In 1525 had appeared a work by the\r\nNeapolitan Marco Antonio Epicuro de' Marsi, styled in the original edition\r\n'dialogo di tre ciechi,' and in later reprints 'tragi-commedia intitulata\r\n_Cecaria_[393].' In this three blind men, one blind with love, another\r\nwith jealousy, the third with gazing too intently on the sun-like beauty\r\nof his mistress, meet and determine to die together. They fall in,\r\nhowever, with a priest of Amor, who sends them back to their respective\r\nloves to be cured. It was this theme that Tansillo arranged in pastoral\r\nform, borrowing even the metres of the original, but it was just the\r\nelement which justifies our including it here that he added, and it is\r\nuseless to seek in Epicuro's work the origin of the form with which it was\r\nthus only accidentally associated.\r\n\r\nA composition of some importance, dating from a period about two years\r\nlater than Tansillo's piece, is an 'ecloga pastorale' by the 'mestissimo\r\ngiovane' Luca di Lorenzo of Siena.[394] Two nymphs, by name Euridice and\r\nDiversa, respectively seek and shun the delights of love. They meet a\r\n_citto_--that is a _bambino_ in Sienese dialect--who proves to be none\r\nother than Cupid himself, and rewards them according to their deserts,\r\nEuridice obtaining the love of the courtly shepherd Orindio, while Diversa\r\nis condemned to follow the rude and loveless Fantasia. The piece is\r\nwritten in a mixture of _ottava_ and _terza rima_, with a variety of\r\nlyrics introduced. The contrast between the loving and the careless\r\nnymphs, and the episode of the latter being bound to a tree, appear to\r\nanticipate the later pastoral; while the introduction of Cupid as a\r\ndramatis persona carries one back to the mythological drama, and the\r\nrustic characters connect the piece with the plays of the Rozzi. Another\r\ncomposition of Tuscan origin is the _Lilia_, first printed in 1538, and\r\ncomposed throughout in polished octaves.[395] It merely relates how the\r\nshepherd Fileno courted the fair Lilia, a certain rustic element being\r\nintroduced in the persons of the herdsmen Crotolo and Tirso.\r\n\r\nWith the _Amaranta_ of Casalio we have been sufficiently concerned in the\r\ntext (p. 172). It was printed at Venice in 1538,[396] having probably been\r\nwritten some years earlier. It is composed in _ottava_ and _terza rima_,\r\nwith the introduction of a canzonet, and marks an important advance on\r\nprevious work, not only in the nature of the plot, but in being divided\r\ninto acts and scenes. Sixteen years elapsed between the publication of\r\n_Amaranta_ and the appearance of the regular pastoral drama in Beccari's\r\n_Sacrifizio_. Some time ago Stiefel pointed out a considerable hiatus at\r\nthis point in Rossi's account, and mentioned certain works which might be\r\nexpected to fill it. These and others have since been examined by\r\nCarducci, with the result that it is possible, at least partially, to\r\nbridge the gap. The period proves to be one less of gradual evolution than\r\nof conscious experiment. At least this is how I read the available\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nBesides the _Cecaria_, mentioned above, Epicuro de' Marsi also left a\r\nmanuscript play entitled _Mirzia_, which he describes as a 'favola\r\nboschereccia,' being thus the first to make use of the term later adopted\r\nby Tasso.[397] The piece, which was written some ten years before the\r\nauthor's death in 1555, leads us off into one of the numerous by-paths\r\ninto which the pastorals of this period were for ever wandering. Two\r\ndespised lovers, together with their friend Ottimo, witness unseen the\r\ndances of Diana and the nymphs, on which occasion Ottimo falls in love\r\nwith the goddess herself. After passing through various plights, into\r\nwhich they are led by their love of the careless nymphs, they all have\r\nrecourse to an oracle, whose predictions are fulfilled through a series of\r\nviolent metamorphoses. This mixture of mythology and magic is wholly\r\nforeign to the spirit of the Arcadian drama, and the _Mirzia_ cannot any\r\nmore than the _Cecaria_ be regarded as the progenitor of that form. I may\r\nmention incidentally that among the characters is a good-natured satyr,\r\nwho consoles Ottimo in his hopeless passion for Diana.\r\n\r\nAnother attempt at mingling the pastoral with the mythological drama, and\r\none which likewise exhibits a tendency to borrow from the rustic\r\ncompositions, is the Florentine 'commedia pastorale' first printed in 1545\r\nunder the title of _Silvia_.[398] The author calls himself Fileno\r\nAddiacciato, from which it would appear that he was a member of the\r\npastoral academy of the Addiaccio, founded at Prato in 1539 by Agnolo\r\nFirenzuola. The prologue relates how the first _archimandrita_ of the\r\nacademy, the title assumed by the president, here called Silvano, was\r\ndriven out by his followers because of certain innovations he made,\r\n'Alzando i Rozzi e deprimendo i buoni.' This would seem to imply that the\r\nhead of the Addiacciati was expelled for evincing too particular an\r\ninterest in the Sienese society, a piece of literary gossip fairly borne\r\nout by the little we know of the events which led up to Firenzuola's\r\ndeparture from Prato. The prologue, indeed, speaks of Silvano as already\r\ndead, which would appear to necessitate the placing of Firenzuola's death\r\nearlier by three years than the accepted date. The inference, however, is\r\nnot necessary, since the expelled president might in his pastoral\r\ncharacter be represented as dead though still alive in the flesh. The play\r\nitself, which is in five acts, and contains characters alike Olympian,\r\nArcadian, and rustic, besides a hermit and a slave, is composed in a\r\nvariety of metres--_terza rima_, octaves both _sdrucciole_ and _piane_,\r\nand in the style alike of Poliziano and Lorenzo, hendecasyllables both\r\nblank and with _rimalmezzo_, and lyrical stanzas. The plot itself is of\r\nthe simplest, and resembles that of the _Amaranta_. Through the sovereign\r\nwill of Venus and Cupid, Silvia and Panfilo love. A temporary\r\nestrangement, brought about by the mischievous rustic Murrone and his\r\nburlesque courting of Silvia, is set right by an opportune appearance of\r\nCupid just as the girl has determined on suicide, and the lovers are\r\nunited according to the Christian rite by the hermit, in the presence of\r\nCupid and Venus. What could be more complete?\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1546, saw the appearance in type of two eclogues,\r\n_Erbusto_ and _Filena_, by a certain Giovanni Agostino Cazza or Caccia,\r\nthe founder of a pastoral academy at Novara, for whose diversion the\r\npieces were presumably composed.[399] The first of these, _Erbusto_, is in\r\nthree acts, and _terza rima_. The elderly Erbusto is the rival of Ameto in\r\nthe love of a shepherdess named Flora. The girl's affections are set on\r\nthe younger suitor, and after some complications she is discovered to be\r\nErbusto's own daughter, stolen as a baby during the war in Piedmont.\r\nSimilar recognitions, imitated from the Roman comedy, are of frequent\r\noccurrence in the regular Italian drama, and are not uncommonly connected,\r\nas here, with some actual event in contemporary history. The second piece,\r\n_Filena_, runs to four acts, and has lyrical songs introduced into the\r\n_terza rima_. It appears to be a sufficiently shameless and somewhat\r\nformless farce, which, being quite alien from the spirit of the regular\r\npastoral, need not be examined in detail.\r\n\r\nTo the next few years belong a series of 'giocose moderne e facetissime\r\necloghe pastorali,' by the Venetian Andrea Calmo, composed in\r\n_endecasillabi sdruccioli sciolti_, and published in 1553.[400] They\r\nintroduce a number of dialects, suited to various personages; Arcadian\r\nshepherds like Lucido, Silvano, and the rest; rustics with names such as\r\nGrítolo di Burano, mythological figures, and a _satiro villan_ who speaks\r\nDalmatian. An advance in dramatization may perhaps be seen in the\r\nintroduction of a second pair of lovers, while the writer goes even\r\nfurther than Beccari in the introduction of oracles (a point in which,\r\nhowever, he had been anticipated by the author of _Mirzia_), and an echo\r\nscene, a device of which Calmo's example is certainly of an elementary\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe most important, however, of the writers between Casalio and Beccari is\r\nthe well-known Ferrarese novelist Giovanbattista Giraldi, surnamed Cintio,\r\nthe author of the _Ecatommiti_, and of a number of tragedies on the\r\nclassical model. The first piece of his which claims our attention is a\r\n_satira_ entitled _Egle_, which was privately performed at the author's\r\nhouse in February, 1545, and again the following month in the presence of\r\nDuke Ercole and his brother, the Cardinal Ippolito d' Este.[401] The play\r\nis an avowed and solitary attempt to revive the 'satyric' drama of the\r\nGreeks, a kind of which the _Cyclops_ of Euripides is the only extant\r\nexample. The action is simple. The rural demigods, fauns, satyrs, and the\r\nlike, having long sought the love of the nymphs of Diana in vain, enter,\r\nat the suggestion of Egle the mistress of Silenus, upon a plan whereby\r\nthey may have the careless maidens in their power. They make a show of\r\nleaving Arcadia in high dudgeon, abandoning their families of little fauns\r\nand satyrs. On these the unwary maids take pity, and begin forthwith to\r\ndance and play with them in the woods. The deceitful divinities, however,\r\nhave only hidden for a while, and when opportunity serves are placed by\r\nEgle where they may surprise the nymphs at sport. They suddenly break\r\ncover, follow and seize the flying girls, and are on the point of enjoying\r\nthe success of their plot when Diana intervenes, transforming her outraged\r\nfollowers into trees, streams, and so forth. The metamorphosis is related\r\nby Pan himself, who returns bearing in his hand a reed, all that is left\r\nof his beloved Syrinx. Thus the piece may be regarded as a dramatization\r\nof Sannazzaro's _Salices_, expanded by the free introduction of\r\nmythological characters, and bears no connexion with the real nature of\r\npastoral, the life-blood of which, whether in the idyls of Theocritus, the\r\n_Arcadia_ of Sannazzaro, or the _Aminta_ of Tasso, is primarily and\r\nessentially human.\r\n\r\nThe other work of Cintio with which we are here concerned, a fragment\r\nwhich remained in MS. till published by Carducci in 1896 as an appendix to\r\nhis essays on the _Aminta_, may be at once pronounced the most important\r\nattempt at writing a really pastoral drama previous to Beccari's\r\n_Sacrifizio_. It is found with the heading 'Favola pastorale' in an\r\nautograph MS., along with several other works of the author, including\r\n_Egle_, but with no indication of the date of composition. The author\r\nsurvived till 1573, but we may reasonably suppose that the piece was\r\nwritten before his departure from Ferrara in 1558. It consists of what are\r\napparently intended for two acts, headed respectively _Parte prima_ and\r\n_Parte quinta_, each consisting of several scenes, though these are not\r\ndistinguished. The first two form a sort of introduction, in which Cupid\r\nand Diana mutually defy one another on account of the nymph Irinda, whom\r\nthe boy-god has wounded with love for Filicio. The shepherd returns her\r\nlove, but finds a rival in Viaste, whose blind passion, though unreturned,\r\nwill admit no discourse of reason. It is, however, ultimately discovered\r\nthat Irinda and Viaste are cousins, a fact which is regarded as a\r\nsufficient reason for the infatuated swain to free himself wholly and\r\nimmediately from his passion, and accept the love of the faithful\r\nFrodignisa, who has followed him throughout.[402] The story, which\r\nresembles that of Cazza's _Erlusto_, is thus of a simple order, and it is\r\nchiefly in the composition that the likeness of the play to the regular\r\npastoral is seen. What the author intended for the middle three acts it is\r\nhard to say, since the action at the opening of the fifth is precisely at\r\nthe point at which the first left it. Probably they were never written,\r\nand the author may even have abandoned his work owing to the difficulty of\r\nfilling the hiatus. In both Cintio's pieces the metre is blank verse\r\n(hendecasyllabic), diversified in the case of the _Egle_ with a rimed\r\nchorus.[403]\r\n\r\nOne point becomes, I think, apparent from the foregoing examination;\r\nnamely, that while the fully developed pastoral owes its origin to the\r\nevolution of the eclogue as a dramatic kind, its final form was arrived\r\nat, not merely by a natural and inevitable process of growth, but as the\r\nresult of direct experimenting on certain lines. The evolution, that is,\r\nwas at the last conscious, not spontaneous. While up to a certain point\r\nthe dramatic germs latent in the eclogue develop upon a natural line of\r\ngrowth, each advance being the reasonable resuit of the action of\r\nsurrounding conditions upon a previous stage of evolution, there comes a\r\ntime when authors seem to have felt that the form was in a state of\r\nunstable equilibrium, that it was advancing towards a final expression,\r\nwhich it had so far failed to find, but which each individual writer\r\nsought to realize in his work. The supposition of a theoretic\r\npreoccupation on the part of these writers is reasonable enough,\r\nconsidering the critical atmosphere in which the pastoral developed, and\r\nthe heated controversy which soon centred round the accomplished form; and\r\nit serves at the same time to explain the liabilities of writers before\r\nTasso to run metaphorically into blind alleys. The conscious endeavour\r\nafter a stable and adequate form appears to me a determining factor in the\r\nwork of Casalio, Cintio, and finally Beccari.\r\n\r\nOf the _Sacrifizio_ of Agostino Beccari[404] have already spoken at some\r\nlength in the text (p. 174). From the account there given it will be seen\r\nthat the plot, though from its threefold character it attains a certain\r\ndegree of complexity, is in reality little more than the scenic\r\ncombination of three distinct stories, each of which might well have\r\nformed the subject of an eclogue, and the whole play is thus closely\r\nconnected with the dramatic simplicity of its origin.[405] The verse,\r\nwhich is blank, interspersed with lyrical passages, shows, like Cintio's,\r\nthe influence of the regular drama. For the satyr we need seek no\r\nindividual source; he was already as much a recognized character of the\r\nItalian pastoral as the Vice was of the English interlude. The magical\r\nelement is doubtless ultimately traceable to a romantic source; it is one\r\nwhich almost entirely drops out of the later pastoral drama, in which the\r\nmore distinctively classical oracle gradually won for itself a place.\r\nFinally, I may remark that Beccari's claim to be considered the originator\r\nof the pastoral drama was made in spite of his being perfectly well\r\nacquainted with Cintio's _Egle_, as a passage in the first scene of Act\r\nIII testifies. There is, indeed, no reason to suppose that any writer\r\nbefore Carducci ever considered Cintio's play as belonging to the realm of\r\npastoral.\r\n\r\nBeccari's immediate successors were of no great interest in themselves,\r\nand contributed little to the development of the form. In 1556 appeared a\r\n'comedia pastorale,' by the Piedmontese Bartolommeo Braida, a hybrid\r\ncomposition in octave rime, written possibly for representation at the\r\ncourt of Claudio of Savoy, governor of Provence and Marseilles, to whose\r\nwife it is dedicated.[406] This piece resembles Poliziano's play, not only\r\nin metrical structure, but in having a prologue spoken by Mercury, while\r\nby its general character it connects itself with such old-fashioned\r\nproductions as Cavassico's Bellunese eclogue of 1513, and the\r\nrepresentation reported from Bologna by Dulfo in 1496. On the other hand,\r\nthe introduction of three pairs of lovers, and the incident of the nymph\r\nbeing bound to a tree, suggest that Braida may at least have heard of the\r\nFerrarese _Sacrifizio_. The whole is a strange medley of various and\r\nincongruous elements--mythological in Mercury and Somnus; pastoral in the\r\nshepherds, Tindaro, Ruffo, Alpardo, and their loves; rustic in the clown\r\nBasso, who speaks Piedmontese in shorter measure; satirical in the wanton\r\nhermit; allegorical in the figure of Disdain; romantic in the wild man of\r\nthe woods and the magic herb. Thus on the whole Braida's work represents a\r\ndecided retrogression in the development of pastoral; or perhaps it may be\r\nmore accurate to say that it renects the tradition of an outlying district\r\nin which that development had been retarded.\r\n\r\nTo this period likewise, if we are to believe the author, belongs a 'nova\r\nfavola pastorale' entitled _Calisto_, by Luigi Groto, the blind\r\nlittérateur of Adria, whose preposterous pastoral, _Il pentimento\r\namoroso_, was produced between the _Aminta_ and the _Pastor fido_.\r\nAccording to a note in the original edition, the piece was first\r\nrepresented at Adria in 1561, revived and rewritten in 1582, and first\r\nprinted the following year.[407] It is founded on the well-known tale of\r\nthe love of Zeus for Calisto, a nymph of Artemis, who by him became the\r\nmother of the Arcadians, as related by Ovid in the second book of the\r\n_Metamorphoses_ (ll. 401, &c.). It may, therefore, so far as the subject\r\nis concerned, be classed among the mythological plays, but the author has\r\nmingled with his main theme much of the vulgar indecency of the Latin\r\ncomedy as adopted in the _cinquecento_ on to the Italian stage. The piece\r\nis composed in _sdrucciolo_ blank verse.\r\n\r\nWith our next author, the orator Alberto Lollio, we return once more to\r\nFerrara. In 1563 a play entitled _Aretusa_[408] was presented before\r\nAlfonso II and his brother the cardinal, by the students of law at\r\nFerrara, at the command, it is said, of Laura Eustoccia d' Este. The verse\r\nis blank, diversified by a single sonnet, but the piece is again a hybrid\r\nof an earlier type--a love-knot solved by the discovery of\r\nconsanguinity--with certain elements of Plautine comedy added. There is\r\nalso extant in MS. the plot, or prose sketch, of another comedy by Lollio,\r\nentitled _Galatea_, on the same model as the _Aretusa_, but with somewhat\r\ngreater complexity of construction.[409]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that, though in the _Sacrifizio_ the final form of the\r\npastoral drama had been attained, the fact was not immediately recognized.\r\nIndeed, until the seal had been set upon that form by the genius of Tasso,\r\nit must have been difficult for any one to realize what had been achieved.\r\nThe form had been discovered, but it remained to prove that it was the\r\nright form, and to show its capabilities. In 1567 a return was made to the\r\ntradition of Beccari in Agostino Argenti's play _Lo Sfortunato_.[410] With\r\nthis piece also, composed in blank verse with a couple of lyric songs, we\r\nhave already been sufficiently concerned (p. 175). I only wish to draw\r\nattention to one point here, namely, that if Guarini's Silvio is a\r\ncompanion portrait to Tasso's Silvia, she in her turn is but the feminine\r\ncounterpart of Argenti's Silvio. The _Sfortunato_ stands on the threshold\r\nof the _Aminta_, and its performance may have suggested to Tasso the\r\ncomposition of his pastoral masterpiece, but it contributed little either\r\nto the evolution of the form, or to the poetic supremacy of its successor.\r\n\r\nWe have arrived at the end of the catalogue, and it is for the reader to\r\ndecide whether or not I have succeeded in establishing a formal continuity\r\nbetween the eclogue and the pastoral drama, and so answering the most\r\nserious of Carducci's objections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix II\r\n\r\nBibliography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny attempt at an adequate bibliography of pastoral literature would\r\nrequire space far greater than that at present at my disposal. In the case\r\nof all the more important works considered in the foregoing inquiry, I\r\nhave been careful to mention the edition from which my quotations are\r\ntaken whenever this was not the original. Nor do I propose to mention in\r\nthis place every book or article which I have consulted in the course of\r\nmy study. Where some particular authority has been followed on some\r\nparticular point the reference has been given in the form of a footnote.\r\nThere are, however, two classes of books which require special mention.\r\nThe first of these consists of those works to which I have had cause\r\nconstantly to refer, and which I have therefore quoted by abbreviated\r\ntitles; and second, of certain works which I have constantly consulted and\r\nfollowed, but to which I have had no occasion to make specific reference\r\nin the notes. A list of the works coming under one or other of these heads\r\nwill give a very fair survey of the critical literature of the subject,\r\nand may therefore not only be convenient to readers of my work, but may\r\nprove useful as a guide to any who may wish to make an independent study.\r\nI have, of course, derived much help from the critical apparatus\r\naccompanying many of the texts cited, but these I have not, as a rule,\r\nthought it necessary to recapitulate here. Where, however, I have used\r\ncritical matter in editions other than those quoted for the text, they\r\nhave been duly recorded. Ordinary works of reference need no specific\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. General.\r\n\r\n\r\n(α) Works on General Literature.

As\r\nthe first serious attempt to investigate the English pastoral drama it\r\ndeserves credit; but in detail it is often inaccurate, while I generally\r\ndisagree with the author on all matters on which divergence of opinion is\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nJosephine Laidler. _A History of Pastoral Drama in England until 1700._\r\nEnglische Studien, July, 1905, xxxv (2). pp. 193-259. This appeared while\r\nmy work vas passing through the press, and though I have read it\r\ncarefully, I think that the reference to Mahaffy's not very accurate\r\naccount of Arcadia (see p. 51, note) is the total extent of my\r\nindebtedness. The article adds little to Homer Smith's work for the period\r\nwith which we are concerned, while it is at the same time both incomplete\r\nand inaccurate.\r\n\r\nA. H. Thorndike. _The Pastoral Element in the English Drama before 1605._\r\nModern Language Notes, vol. xiv. cols. 228-246 (1899). A careful and\r\ninteresting article, which I also only read while my book was in the\r\npress. Though it did not contain much that was new, I was particularly\r\nglad to find myself in agreement with the author as regards the importance\r\nof the pre-Italian tradition in English pastoral.\r\n\r\n(γ) I ought also to mention: J. C. Dunlop. _History of Prose Fiction. A\r\nnew edition by H. Wilson.._2 vols. London, 1888. The fact that this work\r\nconsists chiefly of summaries of plots and stories makes it of great value\r\nfor tracing sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Special.\r\n\r\n\r\n(i) Classical (Chap. I, sect. ii).

The introduction contains a\r\nvery interesting account of the conditions of Alexandrian poetry.\r\n\r\nJoseph Jacobs. _Daphnis and Chloe: the Elizabethan version from Amyot's\r\nTranslation by Angel Day._ London, 1890. The introduction contains an\r\naccount of Longus and his translators.\r\n\r\n\r\n(ii) Medieval and Humanistic (Chap. I, sect. iv). F.

These argue familiarity with\r\nthe scenes of pastoral life, but equally reveal the existence of the\r\ncontrast in the mind of the writer. It was on the orthodox interpretation\r\nof this love-song that Remi Belleau founded his _Éclogues sacrées_, but\r\nthey contain little or nothing of a pastoral nature. The same may be said\r\nof Drayton's paraphrase, included in his _Harmony of the Church_ in 1591,\r\nwhich is chiefly remarkable for the evident and honest pleasure with which\r\nhe rendered the unsophisticated meaning of the original. It is, however,\r\njust possible that the Hebrew poem may have had some influence on pastoral\r\npoetry in Italy. There is a monograph on the subject by A. Abbruzzese, _Il\r\nCantico dei Cantici in alcune parafrasi poetiche italiane: contributo alla\r\nstoria del dramma pastorale_, which, however, I have not seen. With regard\r\nto possible Greek predecessors of Theocritus, it must be borne in mind\r\nthat there were singing contests between shepherds at the Sicilian\r\nfestival of Artemis, and it is possible that the competitors may have been\r\nsufficiently influenced by other orders of civilization to have given a\r\ndefinitely pastoral colouring to their songs. Little is known of their\r\nnature beyond the fact that they probably contained the motive of the\r\nlament for Daphnis, which appears to be as old as Stesichorus. They have\r\nperished all but two lines which are found prefixed by way of motto to the\r\n_Idyls_:\r\n\r\n  [Greek: δέξαι τὰν ἀγαθὰν τύχαν, δέξαι τὰν ὑγίειαν,\r\n  ἃν φέρομεν παρὰ τᾶσ θεοῦ, ἃν ἐκαλέσσατο τήνα.]\r\n\r\nWhat I have wished to emphasize above is the fact that because shepherds\r\nsang songs we have no reason to assume that these were distinctively\r\npastoral. In later times the pastoral generally acknowledged a theoretical\r\ndependence on rustic song, and the popular compositions did actually now\r\nand again affect literary tradition. But this was rare.\r\n\r\n[2] Details concerning the conception of the golden age will be found in\r\nMoorman's _William Browne_, p. 59.\r\n\r\n[3] The tendency to form an ideal picture of his own youth is common both\r\nto mankind and man. The romance of childhood is the dream with which age\r\nconsoles itself for the disillusionments of life. This it is that gives a\r\npeculiar appropriateness to the title of Mr. Graham's pictures of\r\nchildhood in _The Golden Age_, a work of the profoundest insight and\r\ngenius, as delightful as it is unique. I am not aware that there has ever\r\nbeen another author in English who could have written thus intimately of\r\nchildren without once striking a false note.\r\n\r\n[4] There is some truth in the charge. Even Symonds wrote of Theocritus,\r\npossibly with Fontenelle's words in his mind: 'As it is, we find enough of\r\nrustic grossness on his pages, and may even complain that his cowherds and\r\ngoatherds savour too strongly of their stables.' (_Greek Poets_, ii. p.\r\n246.)\r\n\r\n[5] Landscapes as decoration may be seen on the walls of the so-called\r\nCasa Nuova at Pompeii. It should be remarked that one idyl is addressed to\r\nHiero, ruler of Syracuse, and it is quite possible that Theocritus may\r\nhave been a frequent visitor there.\r\n\r\n[6] Theocritus flourished in the first half of the third century B.C. Some\r\nauthorities place the younger poets more than a hundred years later.\r\n\r\n[7] Familiar to English readers through Matthew Arnold's translation.\r\n\r\n[8] Suidas says that Moschus came from Sicily, and some authorities speak\r\nof him as a Syracusan. But in his 'Lament' he alludes to his 'Ausonian'\r\nsong, apparently as distinguished from that of Theocritus 'of Syracuse.'\r\nThe passage, however, is rendered obscure by an hiatus. Another tradition\r\nmade Theocritus a native of the island of Cos. More probably it was\r\nbetween the time of his leaving Syracuse and that of his settling at\r\nAlexandria that he was the pupil of the Coan poet and critic, Philetas.\r\n\r\n[9] Ernest Myers' version from Andrew Lang's delightful volume in the\r\nGolden Treasury Series.\r\n\r\n[10] Placing the romance, that is, in the third century A.D. Authorities\r\nassign it to various dates from the second to the sixth centuries,\r\naccording as they regard it as a model or an imitation of Heliodorus'\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[11] A similar use of ἀναγνώρισις is very frequent in the Italian pastoral\r\ndrama, where, however, it is more probably derived from Latin comedy.\r\n\r\n[12] This was not the first Italian version of Longus. _Daphnis and Chloe_\r\nhad been translated directly from the Greek by Annibale Caro in the\r\nprevious century.\r\n\r\n[13] Two poems, written in close imitation of Theocritus' natural manner,\r\nand entitled respectively _Moretum_ and _Copa_, have sometimes, but\r\nwrongly, been attributed to Vergil.\r\n\r\n[14] _Greek Poets_, ii. p. 265.\r\n\r\n[15] Symonds speaks strongly on the point. 'Virgil not only lacks his\r\n[Theocritus'] vigour and enthusiasm for the open-air life of the country,\r\nbut, with Roman bad taste, he commits the capital crime of allegorising.'\r\n(_Greek Poets_, ii. p. 247.)\r\n\r\n[16] Seyffert's classical dictionary, as revised by Nettleship and Sandys\r\n(1899), definitely assigns Calpurnius to the middle of the first century.\r\nIn that case the amphitheatre mentioned was no doubt the wooden structure\r\nthat preceded the Colosseum.\r\n\r\n[17] See, in Conington and Nettleship's _Virgil_, 1881, the essay on 'The\r\nLater Bucolic Poets of Rome,' in which will be found a detailed account of\r\nthis very intricate controversy.\r\n\r\n[18] It would appear that the two founders of the renaissance eclogue\r\ndeliberately chose the Vergilian form as that best suited to their\r\npurpose. Petrarch calls attention to the advantages offered by the\r\npastoral for covert reference to men and events of the day, since it is\r\ncharacteristic of the form to let its meaning only partially appear. He\r\nwas therefore perfectly aware of the allegorical nature of the Vergilian\r\neclogue, and adopted it for definite purposes of utility. Boccaccio is\r\neven more explicit, and I cannot do better than transcribe the very\r\ninteresting summary of the history of pastoral verse down to his day,\r\ngiven in a letter addressed by him to Martino da Signa, which I shall\r\nagain have occasion to mention in dealing with his own contributions to\r\nthe kind. He writes: 'Theocritus Syracusanus Poeta, ut ab antiquis\r\naccepimus, primus fuit, qui Graeco Carmine Buccolicum escogitavit stylum,\r\nverum nil sensit, praeter quod cortex verborum demonstrat. Post hunc\r\nLatine scripsit Virgilius, sed sub cortice nonnullos abscondit sensus,\r\nesto non semper voluerit sub nominibus colloquentium aliquid sentiremus.\r\nPost hunc autem scripserunt et alii, sed ignobiles, de quibus nil curandum\r\nest, excepto inclyto Praeceptore meo Francisco Petrarca qui stylum praeter\r\nsolitum paululum sublimavit et secundum Eclogarum suarum materias continue\r\ncollocutorum nomina aliquid significantia posuit. Ex his ego Virgilium\r\nsecutus sum quapropter non curavi in omnibus colloquentium nominibus\r\nsensum abscondere.' _Lettere di G. Boccaccio_, ed. Corazzini, 1877, p.\r\n267.\r\n\r\n[19] Line 1228. See Skeat's note in the _Athenæum_, March 1, 1902.\r\n\r\n[20] On all points connected with these compositions see the elaborate\r\nmonograph by Wicksteed and Gardner.\r\n\r\n[21] Dante's poems do not stand altogether isolated in this respect. It\r\nwould be possible to cite eclogues formerly ascribed to Mussato, as also\r\nsome from the pens of Giovanni de Boni of Arezzo and Cecco di Mileto, in\r\nsupport of the above remarks. It is significant of their independence of\r\nmedieval pastoralism, that Giovanni del Virgilio repeatedly speaks of\r\nDante as the first to write bucolic poetry since Vergil, thus ignoring the\r\nwhole production from Calpurnius to Metellus.\r\n\r\n[22] Boccaccio was of course acquainted with Dante's eclogues, and in his\r\nlife of the poet he allows them considerable beauty. It seems never to\r\nhave occurred to him, however, to regard them as serious contributions to\r\npastoral literature, for, as we have already seen, he stigmatizes all\r\nbucolic writers between Vergil and Petrarch as _ignobiles_. I do not think\r\nthis attitude was due to the influence of Petrarch having lessened his\r\nadmiration of Dante, as maintained by Wicksteed and Gardner, but simply to\r\nhis recognition of the absolute unimportance of the poems in question from\r\nthe historical point of view.\r\n\r\n[23] In this connexion it will be remembered that Dante places Brutus and\r\nCassius, the betrayers of Julius, in company with Judas, the betrayer of\r\nChrist, as arch-traitors in the innermost circle of hell (_Inferno_,\r\nxxxiv). He was no doubt influenced in this by his philosophical Ghibelline\r\ntendencies.\r\n\r\n[24] The evolution of this idea, suggested of course by John X. II, can be\r\nclearly traced in the mosaics at Ravenna.\r\n\r\n[25] So Hortis (_Scritti inediti di F. Petrarca_, pp. 221, &c.), who\r\ncombats A. W. von Schlegel's view that the Epy of Eclogue VII stands for\r\nAvignon.\r\n\r\n[26] This spelling was current for some centuries, Spenser among others\r\nadopting it. Indeed, _egloghe_ is still the prevalent form among Italian\r\nscholars.\r\n\r\n[27] One other was discovered and published from MS. by Hortis, in his\r\n_Studi sulle opere latini_, p. 351.\r\n\r\n[28] It is not impossible that Boccaccio may have begun composing eclogues\r\nbefore his acquaintance with Petrarch, since the influence of the poems\r\nsent by Dante to Giovanni del Virgilio has been traced in the eclogue\r\nprinted by Hortis, and in an early version of the _Faunus_, as well as in\r\nthe work of Boccaccio's correspondent, Cecco di Mileto.\r\n\r\n[29] So Aeneas Sylvius, in his _De Remedio Amoris_, after a particularly\r\nvirulent tirade against women, explained: 'De his loquor mulieribus quae\r\nturpes admittunt amores.'\r\n\r\n[30] 'Syncerius' is the form used, but there can be little doubt who was\r\nintended.\r\n\r\n[31] In the days when it was fashionable for men of learning to discuss\r\nthe laws of pastoral composition, a certain northern giant fell foul of\r\nthe Neapolitan's piscatory eclogues on somewhat theoretical grounds.\r\nHaving never seen the blue smile of the bay of Naples, he suggested that\r\nthe sea was an object of terror; forgetful of the monotonous setting of\r\npastoral verse, he complained that the piscatory life offered little\r\nvariety; finally, he contended that the technicalities of the craft were\r\nunfamiliar to readers--but are we to suppose that the learned author of\r\nthe _Rambler_ was competent to tend a flock?\r\n\r\n[32] They were at least the first to appear in print. The contributors\r\nwere Girolamo Benivieni, of Florence, and Francesco Arsocchi and Fiorino\r\nBoninsegni, of Siena. The first possibly deserves mention as having\r\nintroduced Pico della Mirandola as a character in his eclogues: some of\r\nthe poems of the last are noteworthy as having been composed as early as\r\n1468. There exists a poem by Luca Pulci on the story of Polyphemus and\r\nGalatea in the form of an eclogue. Luca died in 1470. Leo Battista\r\nAlberti, the famous architect, who died in 1472, also left a poem, which\r\nwas published from MS. in 1850, with the heading 'Egloga.' This, however,\r\nproves not to be strictly pastoral. Among other early ventures were ten\r\nItalian eclogues in _terza rima_, by Boiardo. These, and also his ten\r\nLatin eclogues, will be found printed from MS. in his _Poesie volgari e\r\nlatine_ (ed. A. Solerti, Bologna, 1894), while full accounts of both will\r\nbe found in the essays contributed by G. Mazzoni and A. Campani to the\r\n_Studi su M. M. Boiardo_, edited by N. Campanini (Bologna, 1894). There\r\ncan be no doubt that the court of Lorenzo was full of pastoral experiments\r\nin the vernacular for some time before the publication mentioned above.\r\n\r\n[33] Having regard to the general character of the _Ameto_, I am not sure\r\nthat it might not be possible to find some hidden meaning in the poem in\r\nquestion, if one were challenged to do so. The allegory is, however,\r\nmostly of the abstract kind, and the eclogue can hardly conceal allusions\r\nto any actual events.\r\n\r\n[34] A very useful and representative, though of course by no means\r\ncomplete, collection is that by G. Ferrario, in the 'Classici italiani.'\r\n\r\n[35] Castiglione also figured among the Latin eclogists of his day, and\r\nthe influence of his _Alcon_ is even traced by Saintsbury in _Lycidas_\r\n(_Earlier Renaissance_, p. 34).\r\n\r\n[36] It is said to have been by way of penance for having written the\r\n_Vendemmiatore_ that he later undertook the composition of the _Lagrime di\r\nSan Pietro_, a lengthy religious poem, which remained unfinished at his\r\ndeath in 1568.\r\n\r\n[37] _La Beca_ is ascribed by mistake to Luca Pulci in the first edition\r\nof Symonds' _Renaissance_.\r\n\r\n[38] The best imitation is said to be the _Lamento di Cecco da Varlungo_\r\nby Francesco Baldovini (1643-1700), which is graceful, though rather more\r\nsatiric in tone than its model.\r\n\r\n[39] It differs, however, from most poems of the sort, in that the\r\nlangnage of the fisher craft in Italy was capable of the same wantonly\r\ndouble meaning as was suggested to English writers by the name and terms\r\nof the noble art of venery. This serves to differentiate it from the style\r\nof pastoral, and suggests that we should rather class it along with such\r\nworks as Berni's _Caccia d'amore._\r\n\r\n[40] It is occasionally traceable in the French _pastourelles_, but that\r\nform of courtly composition never became popular south of the Alps. Its\r\nvogue passed completely with the decline of Provençal tradition. D'Ancona\r\nquotes one Italian example of the thirteenth century, the work of a\r\nFlorentine, Ciacco dell' Anguillaja. It begins gracefully enough:\r\n\r\n  O gemma leziosa,\r\n    Adorna villanella,\r\n    Che se' più virtudiosa\r\n    Che non se ne favella,\r\n    Per la virtude ch' hai\r\n    Per grazia del Signore,\r\n    Aiutami, che sai\r\n    Che son tuo servo, amore.\r\n\r\n\r\n[41] Further evidence of the popularity of this poem will be found in the\r\nexistence of a religious parody beginning:\r\n\r\n  O vaghe di Gesù, o verginelle,\r\n    Dove n' andate si leggiadre e belle?\r\n\r\n(_Laude spirituali di Feo Belcari_, &c., Firenze, 1863, p. 105.) It is\r\nfounded on the fourteenth ceutury, not on the popular, version.\r\n\r\n[42] The foregoing remarks follow very closely Symonds' treatment in the\r\nthird chapter of his _Italian Literature_. In point of fact, I lit on\r\nDonati's poem quite accidentally, before reading the chapter in question,\r\nbut I have made no scruple of availing myself of his guidance wherever it\r\nwas to be had.\r\n\r\n[43] Symonds has some very severe strictures on these songs from the moral\r\npoint of view. Judging from the actual songs themselves his remarks would\r\nappear somewhat exaggerated, but if we take into consideration the\r\nhistorical circumstances they are probably amply justified.\r\n\r\n[44] It is perhaps worth putting in a word of warning against the possible\r\nconfusion of this poem with Politian's Latin composition bearing the same\r\ntitle. Ambra was a rustic resort in the neighbourhood of Florence, to\r\nwhich Lorenzo was much attached. By the lover Lauro the author seems to\r\nhave meant himself. At least this is rendered probable by some lines near\r\nthe end of Politian's poem, in which the villa is again personified as a\r\nnymph:\r\n\r\n  Et nos ergo illi grata pietate dicamus\r\n  Hanc de Pierio contextam flore coronam,\r\n  Quam mihi Caianas inter pulcherrima nymphas\r\n  Ambra dedit patriae lectam de gramine ripae:\r\n  Ambra mei Laurentis amor, quam corniger Vmbro,\r\n  Vmbro senex genuit domino gratissimus Arno:\r\n  Vmbro suo tandem non erupturus ab alneo.\r\n    (_Opera,_ Basel, 1553, p. 581.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[45] He was born at Montepulciano in 1454, and died, at the age of forty,\r\ntwo years after Lorenzo.\r\n\r\n[46] Symonds, _Renaissance_, iv. p. 232, note 3.\r\n\r\n[47] It has been sometimes thought that the description of Mars in the lap\r\nof Venus, in stanzas 122-3, suggested Botticelli's picture in the National\r\nGallery; but, though the lines are worthy of having inspired even a more\r\nsuccessful example of the painter's art, the resemblance is in this case\r\ntoo general to warrant any such conclusion.\r\n\r\n[48] A favourite phrase of his. 'What has been well called _la voluttà\r\nidillica_--the sensuous sensibility to beauty, finding fit expression in\r\nthe Idyll--formed a marked characteristic of Renaissance art and\r\nliterature.' _Renaissance_, v. p. 170.\r\n\r\n[49] The similar alternation of verse and prose found in the French and\r\nProvençal _cante-fables,_ notably in _Aucassin et Nicolette,_ is of a\r\ndifferent nature, for in them the prose served properly to explain and\r\nconnect the verse-passages which contained the actual story, and it\r\nprobably formed no part of the original composition.\r\n\r\n[50] I quote from the handy edition of Boccaccio's _Opere minori_ in the\r\n'Biblioteca classica economica.' The passages cited above will be found on\r\npp. 246 and 250, or in the _Opere volgari_, 1827-34. xv. pp. 186 and 194.\r\n\r\n[51] It is probably no accident that, like Dante's poem, Boccaccio's\r\nromance is styled a 'comedy.' Both represent, in allegorical form, the\r\nascent of the human soul from sin, through purgation, to the presence of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n[52] It has been suggested that there is a gradual spiritualization in the\r\nmotives of the tales; but this would appear to be a somewhat fanciful\r\nview.\r\n\r\n[53] Proemio, _Opere minori_, p. 145; _Opere volgari_, xv. p. 4.\r\n\r\n[54] _Opere minori_, p. 176, _Opere volgari_, xv. p. 60.\r\n\r\n[55] While greatly shortening the passage, and taking considerable\r\nliberties in the way of paraphrase, I have endeavoured, as far as\r\npossible, to preserve the style and diction of the original. This will be\r\nfound in the _Opere minori_, pp. 213, &c., _Opere volgari_, xv. pp. 126,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n[56] The description of the spring is from Ovid, _Metamorphoses_, III,\r\n407, &c. No doubt a great deal more could be traced to Latin sources.\r\n\r\n[57] For details concerning tree-lists see Moorman's _William Brown_, p.\r\n154.\r\n\r\n[58] Dunlop's notion of the verse being the important part, and the prose\r\nonly written to connect the varions eclogues, is clearly wrong. Verse\r\nstarted by being subordinate in Boccaccio's romance, and remained so in\r\nall subsequent examples.\r\n\r\n[59] _Prosa_ VIII. The whole passage was versified in Spanish by\r\nGarcilaso, whence a portion found its way into Googe's eclogues. Among\r\nother ingenions devices Sannazzaro mentions that of pinning down a crow by\r\nthe extremity of its wings and waiting for it to entangle its fellows in\r\nits claws. If any reader should be tempted to imagine that the author has\r\nbeen drawing on a fertile imagination, let him turn to the adventures of\r\none Morrowbie Jukes, as related by Mr. Rudyard Kipling, for a description\r\nof this identical method of crow-catching as practised on the banks of an\r\nIndian stream.\r\n\r\n[60] It may be well to point out that at times, as in Carino's invocation\r\nto the Dryads, Symonds has infused into his version a beauty of diction of\r\nwhich Sannazzaro appears to be innocent.\r\n\r\n[61] The _Arcadia_ must have been extant in its original form as early as\r\n1481, when it served as model for the eclogues of Pietro Jacopo de\r\nJennaro. The earliest known MS. dates from 1489, and contains the first\r\nten _Prose_ and _Ecloghe_. In this form it was surreptitiously printed in\r\n1502; the complete work first appeared in 1504. The earliest commentary,\r\nthat of Tommaso Porcacchi, appeared in 1558, and went through several\r\neditions. An elaborate variorum edition was printed at Padua in 1723. I\r\nhave followed the text in the 'Classici italiani.'\r\n\r\n[62] Arcadia had been called 'the mother of flocks' in the Homeric _Hymn\r\nto Pan_, and Polybius had described the softening effects of music upon\r\nits rude inhabitants. See some interesting remarks on the snbject by J. E.\r\nSandys, in his lectures on the _Revival of Learning_, Cambridge, 1905;\r\nalso J. P. Mahaffy, _Rambles and Studies_, ch. xii.\r\n\r\n[63] Having had occasion in the course of the following pages to call\r\nattention to certain inaccuracies of Ticknor's, I should like in this\r\nplace to record my indebtedness to what still remains the standard history\r\nof Spanish literature. I have likewise made free use of\r\nFitzmaurice-Kelly's admirable monograph.\r\n\r\n[64] _Don Quixote_, pt. ii. ch. 62.\r\n\r\n[65] Calderon wrote an early play on the tale of Cephalus and Procris,\r\nwhich met, it is said, with success. It was entitled _Celos aun del aire\r\nmatan_, and was styled a 'fiesta cantada.' Later in life he parodied it in\r\nthe 'comedia burlesca' entitled _Cefalo y Pocris_ (sic). Neither play\r\nappears to have any connexion with the _Cefalo_ of Niccolò da Correggio\r\n(_v. post_, ch. iii). Both are printed in the third volume of Calderon's\r\ncomedies in the 'Biblioteca de autores españoles,' 1848-50. The _Pastor\r\nfido_ will be found in vol. iv.\r\n\r\n[66] Mr. Gosse has protested against the use of such terms as 'exotic' in\r\nconnexion with products of literary art, and no doubt the word has been\r\nnot a little abused. I employ it in its strict sense of 'introduced from\r\nabroad, not indigenons,' and without implying any critical censure.\r\n\r\n[67] Though a Portuguese, and one of the most notable poets in his own\r\ndialect, much of his poetical work is in Castillan.\r\n\r\n[68] So, at least, Theophilo Braga interprets what he calls 'o drama\r\namoroso das Eclogas,' in his monograph on _Bernardim Ribeiro e o\r\nbucolismo_. Porto, 1897.\r\n\r\n[69] Ticknor is responsible for an unfortunate error, and much consequent\r\nconfusion, respecting this date. Some one had cited an imaginary edition\r\nof 1545. Of this Ticknor confessed ignorance, but stated that he had in\r\nhis possession a copy consisting of 112 quarto leaves, printed at Valencia\r\nin 1542. This description applies exactly to the earliest edition extant\r\nin the British Museum, except in the matter of the date. There can be no\r\ndoubt that this is a mistake. The date 1542 is intrinsically impossible.\r\nFitzmaurice-Kelly, who himself dates the work 1558-9, points out that one\r\nof the songs refers to events which took place in 1554. The sudden crop of\r\nreprints, dated 1561 and 1562, proves the _Diana_ to have been then a new\r\nbook, and inclines me to place the actual publication somewhat after the\r\ndate suggested by Kelly. I may mention that Ticknor is also in error over\r\nthe date of Ribeiro's work, which he assigns to 1557.\r\n\r\n[70] See the collection of Latin student songs, _Gaudeamus!

The tendency they indicate, however, is not\r\ntraceable in later pastoral, as it is with us. That such representations\r\nas those of the Sienese 'Rozzi' formed no exception to this general\r\nstatement I shall have to show later.\r\n\r\n[76] For the literary history of the Wakefield cycle, see A.

In\r\ndealing with isolated poems I have quoted, wherever possible, from\r\nBullen's reprints of the song books, &c.\r\n\r\n[82] Forst = cared for.\r\n\r\n[83] It first appeared as 'The Ploughman's Song' in the 'Entertainment at\r\nElvetham' in 1591. This has been recently claimed for Lyly. Without\r\nexpressing any opinion in this place as to the likelihood of such an\r\nascription for the bulk of the piece, it may be remarked that the song in\r\nquestion is as like the rest of Breton's work in style as it is unlike\r\nanything to be found in Lyly's writings.\r\n\r\n[84] Of all pedestrian, not to say reptilian, metres, this is perhaps the\r\nmost intolerable; indeed, it was not until touched to new life by the\r\ngenius of Blake that it deserved to be called a metre at all.\r\n\r\n[85] See R. B. McKerrow's articles on the Elizabethan 'classical metres' in\r\nthe _Modern Language Quarterly_ for December, 1901, and April, 1902, iv.\r\np. 172, and v. p. 6.\r\n\r\n[86] Eclogues i-iv were printed by Pynson, and the fifth by Wynkyn de\r\nWorde early in the century; i-iii were twice reprinted about 1550. Barclay\r\ndied in 1552.\r\n\r\n[87] Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini, afterwards Pope Pius II. I suppose that\r\nit is on account of this statement of Barclay's that English critics have\r\nconstantly referred to the work as pastoral. It is nothing but a prose\r\ninvective against court life.\r\n\r\n[88] See Dyce's _Skelton_, Introduction, p. xxxvi.\r\n\r\n[89] 'Eglogs Epytaphes, and Sonettes. Newly written by Barnabe Googe:\r\n1563. 15. Marche.' Reprinted by Professer Arber from the Huth copy.\r\n\r\n[90] The title of the collection as originally published is obviously\r\nambiguous--is Shepheardes' to be considered as singular or plural? There\r\nis a tendency among modern critics to evade the difficulty in such cases\r\nby quoting titles in the original spelling. I confess that this practice\r\nseems to me both clumsy and pedantic. In the present case there can be\r\nlittle doubt that the title of Spenser's work was suggested by the\r\n_Calender of Shepherds_. On the other hand, I think it is likewise clear\r\nthat the poet, in adopting it, was thinking particularly of Colin\r\nClout--that he intended, that is, to call his poems 'the calender of the\r\nshepherd' (see first line of postscript), rather than 'the calender for\r\nshepherds.' I have therefore adopted the singular form. 'Calender' is, I\r\nthink, a defensible spelling.\r\n\r\n[91] The alternative view, which would make Spenser his own commentator,\r\nis not without supporters both in Germany and in this country. Even were\r\nthe question, however, one of greater importance from our point of view,\r\nthe 'proofs' so far adduced do not constitute sufficient of an _a priori_\r\ncase to justify discussion here.\r\n\r\n[92] _Anglia_, iii. p. 266, and ix. p. 205.\r\n\r\n[93] At the end of the _Calender_ Spenser placed as his motto 'Merce non\r\nmercede'--as merchandise, not for reward.\r\n\r\n[94] On all questions relating to the _Shepherd's Calender_ see C. H.\r\nHerford's edition, to which I gratefully acknowledge my indebtedness. So\r\nfar as I am aware, we possess no more admirable edition of any monument of\r\nEnglish literature.\r\n\r\n[95] Cf. the titles of Drayton's _Idea_ and Basse's MS. eclogues, _infra_.\r\n\r\n[96] _Discoveries_, 1640 (-41), p. 116 (Gifford, 1875; § cxxv). The\r\n'ancients,' as appears from the context, are Chaucer and Gower.\r\n\r\n[97] _Apology for Poetry_, 1595; Arber's edition, p. 63.\r\n\r\n[98] Even Sidney's authorities break down to some extent. Theocritus\r\ncertainly modified the literary dialect in his pastoral idyls, and we may\r\nrecall that when Vergil began his third eclogue with the line--\r\n\r\n  Die mihi, Damoeta, cuium pecus? an Meliboei?\r\n\r\na wit of Rome retorted:\r\n\r\n  Die mihi, Damoeta, 'cuium pecus?' anne Latinum?\r\n\r\nOr again it may be asked whether Lorenzo de' Medici is not as good a name\r\nto conjure by as Jacopo Sannazzaro.\r\n\r\n[99] Some of the eclogues are mucn more pronouncedly dialectal than\r\nothers, but even within the limits of a single one, literary and dialectal\r\nforms may often be found used indiscriminately. See Herford's remarks on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n[100] 'February,' l. 33, &c. Lines 35-6 contain one of the few direct\r\nreminiscences of Chaucer. Cf. _House of Fame_, II. 1225-6. Spenser\r\nrepeated the imitation, _Faery Queen_, VI. ix. 43-5, and was followed by\r\nFletcher, _Faithful Shepherdess_, V. v. 183-4.\r\n\r\n[101] _Pastime of Pleasure_, xxxv. 6, from the edition of 1555 (Percy\r\nSoc., 1845, p. 113).\r\n\r\n[102] In the above instance the rime is sacrificed, and I do not mean that\r\nall anomalous lines in Spenser's measure become strict decasyllables when\r\ndone into ME.; indeed, they do so of course only by accident. My point is\r\nthat Chaucer's verse as read by the sixteenth-century editors must have\r\noften contained just such unmetrical lines as Spenser's. The view I have\r\nindicated above is that accepted by W. J. Courthope (_History of English\r\nPoetry_, ii. p. 253). Herford, on the other hand, while having recourse to\r\nChancer's influence to explain Spenser's anomalies, regards the metre in\r\nquestion as derived from the old alliterative line. From this view I am\r\nreluctantly forced to dissent. The alliterative line may be readily traced\r\nin the mystery cycles, and later influenced the verse of the interludes\r\nand such comedies as _Royster Doyster_; and this tradition may have\r\naffected the verse of the later poets of the school of Lydgate, and even\r\nthe popular ideas concerning Chaucer's metre. But as to the actual origin\r\nof Spenser's four-beat line there can surely be no doubt.\r\n\r\n[103] The late A. B. Grosart, in a passage which is a masterpiece of\r\nliterary casuistry _(Spenser_, iii. p. lii.), put forward the truly\r\nastounding theory that the discussions on the evils of the clergy and\r\nsimilar subjects, put into the mouths of shepherds in the _Calender_ and\r\nelsewhere, are 'in nicest keeping with character.' Such a theory ignores\r\nthe essence of the question, for, even supposing that shepherds had done\r\nnothing else but discuss the corruption of the Curia since there was a\r\nCuria to be corrupted, it is still utterly beside the mark. Apart from his\r\nown observation of ecclesiastical manners, Spenser's compositions have for\r\ntheir sole origin the similar discussions of the humanistic eclogues,\r\nwhile these in their turn did but cast the individual opinions of their\r\nauthors into a conventional mould inherited from the classical poets.\r\nThus, so far as actual shepherds are connected with Spenser's eclogues at\r\nall, they belong to an age when the Curia and all its sins were happily\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n[104] The MS. is now in the library of Caius College, Cambridge, and is\r\ncontained in the volume numbered 595 in the catalogue. It is entitled\r\n_Poimenologia_. The dedication to William James, Dean of Christ Church,\r\nfixes the date as between 1584 and 1596. Dove became Master of Arts in\r\n1586, and since he does not describe himself as such, the translation\r\nprobably belongs to an earlier date. I am indebted for knowledge of and\r\ninformation concerning this MS. to the kindness of Prof. Moore Smith, and\r\nof Dr. J. S. Reid, Librarian of Caius College.\r\n\r\n[105] Winstanley (_Lives of the English Poets_, 1687, p. 196) ascribes it\r\nto Sir Richard Fanshawe; but he was no doubt confusing it with the Latin\r\nversion of the _Faithful Shepherdess_.\r\n\r\n[106] _Faery Queen_, VII. vi. 349, &c.\r\n\r\n[107] Somewhat similar episodes occur both in the _Orlando_ and the\r\n_Gerusalemme_, to the imitation of which, indeed, certain passages in\r\nSpenser can be directly referred.\r\n\r\n[108] See A. H. Bullen's edition, two vols., 1890-91. The poems in question\r\nwill be fonnd in vol. i, pp. 48, 58, 63 and 76.\r\n\r\n[109] It is worth noting that in the last stanza all the early editions\r\nread 'Thenot' instead of 'Wrenock'; Thenot being the corresponding\r\ncharacter in Spenser.\r\n\r\n[110] Perhaps Anne Goodere: but the question is alien to our present\r\ndiscussion. Some of the allusions in the eclogues are obvious, and\r\nprobably all the names, except perhaps the speaker's, conceal real\r\npersonalities. In the _Muses' Elizium_, on the other hand, most of the\r\nnames and characters appear to me fictitious. In connexion with the name\r\n'Idea,' in which certain critics have wished to see a deep philosophical\r\nmeaning, I would suggest that it may be nothing but the feminine of\r\n'Idaeus,' that is, a shepherd of Mount Ida, a name found in the second\r\neclogue of Petrarch. It is, however, true that the word 'idea' bore the\r\nmeaning of 'an ideal,' in which sense, no doubt, we occasionally find it\r\napplied to England.\r\n\r\n[111] Concerning translations of Watson's Latin poems, I may be allowed to\r\nrefer to a paper contributed to the _Modern Language Quarterly_, February,\r\n1904, vi. p. 125.\r\n\r\n[112] Cf. the passage from Spenser's October eclogue, quoted on p. 88.\r\n\r\n[113] A certain similarity between this poem and the song in _Love's\r\nLabour's Lost_, beginning:\r\n\r\n  On a day--alack the day!--\r\n  Love, whose month was ever May;\r\n\r\nhas caused them to be at times ascribed to Shakespeare. They are\r\nsubscribed 'Ignoto' in _England's Helicon_, but appeared among the poems\r\npublished with Barnfield's _Lady Pecunia_ in 1598, a tail of thirty lines\r\nof very inferior quality being substituted for the singularly perfect and\r\neffective final couplet. The poem appeared again in the following year in\r\nthe _Passionate Pilgrim_, this time with both the couplet and the\r\naddition. The _Helicon_ version is certainly by far the best, and not\r\nimprobably represents the poem as originally written in imitation of\r\nShakespeare's. See J. B. Henneman's paper in _An English Miscellany_,\r\nOxford, 1901.\r\n\r\n[114] Gascoigne's _Steel Glass_ is far rather medieval in conception.\r\n\r\n[115] Compare with the lines in _Rosalynd_, beginning 'Phoebe sat, sweet\r\nshe sat,' those in _Tarlton's News out of Purgatory_, beginning, 'Down I\r\nsat, I sat down,' and see A. H. Bullen's _Poems from Elizabethan Romances_,\r\n1890, p. xi.\r\n\r\n[116] The copy of _Pan's Pipe_ in the British Museum wants the _Tale_, but\r\nthis will be found by itself marked C. 40. e. 68 (2, 3).\r\n\r\n[117] Collier and Hazlitt supposed two William Basses, but the balance of\r\nevidence seems against the theory. See S. L. Lee in _Dic. Nat. Biog_., and\r\nthe edition by R. W. Bond, 1893.\r\n\r\n[118] Fleay (_Biographical Chronicle_, i. p. 67) identifies Musidore with\r\nLodge, and 'Hero's last Musaeus' with H. Petowe. The latter\r\nidentification, which had already been proposed by Collier\r\n(_Bibliographical Account_, i. p. 130), is in all probability correct.\r\n\r\n[119] Printed by me in the _Modern Language Quarterly_, July, 1901, iv. p.\r\n85.\r\n\r\n[120] These are missing in most copies of the book; the only one I know\r\ncontaining them is in the Bodleian.\r\n\r\n[121] I do not know who started the idea. It was mentioned in the\r\n_Retrospective Review_ (ii. p. 180) in 1820, accepted by Sommer, and\r\nelaborated with small success by K. Windscheid. Masson makes no mention of\r\nit in his edition of Milton's poetical works. The author of _Lycidas_ was\r\nprobably a reader and admirer of Browne's poems, but of _Britannia's\r\nPastorals_ rather than of the decidedly inferior eclogues.\r\n\r\n[122] The _Arcadian Princess_, translated by Brathwaite from Mariano\r\nSilesio, a kind of metaphorical manual of judicial polity, is in no way\r\npastoral. It may be remarked that in 1627 there appeared as the work of\r\none I. D. B. an 'Eclogue, ou Chant Pastoral,' on the marriage (1625) of\r\nCharles and Henrietta Maria, in which two Scotch Shepherds, Robin and\r\nJacquet, discourse in French Alexandrines. _Taylor's Pastoral_ of 1624\r\nagain, a fanciful treatise of religious and secular history, does not\r\nproperly belong to pastoral tradition.\r\n\r\n[123] One of these appeared two years previously, entitled _The Shepherd's\r\nOracle_.\r\n\r\n[124] Appended to the third edition of the _Arcadia_, 1598.\r\n\r\n[125] Appended to the _Arcadia_ in 1613.\r\n\r\n[126] _Arcadia_, 1590, fol. 237 verso.\r\n\r\n[127] _Opera_, Basel, 1553, p. 622.\r\n\r\n[128] The song is said to be between 'two nymphs, each answering other\r\nline for line'; but the simple alternation adopted by Spenser makes\r\nnonsense of the present poem. The above arrangement seems to distribute\r\nthe lines best; viz. the first quatrain to Phillis, with interposition of\r\nlines 2 and 4 by Amaryllis, the second quatrain to Amaryllis, with\r\ninterposition of line 2 only by Phillis.\r\n\r\n[129] Others in the _Passionate Pilgrim_, 1599, and Walton's _Complete\r\nAngler_, 1653.\r\n\r\n[130] So, rather than 'Fair-lined,' as Bullen prints; but query\r\n'Fur-lined.'\r\n\r\n[131] This is the text of _England's Helicon_, which is superior to that\r\nin the play, except for the omission of the couplet in brackets, and\r\npossibly in the reading 'hath sworn' for 'is sworn,' in l. 11.\r\n\r\n[132] From E. K. Chambers' _English Pastorals_, p. 113. The date is\r\nuncertain, but a tune of the name was extant in 1603. The earliest\r\nrecorded text is a broadside, of about 1650, in the Roxburghe collection\r\n(III. 142). The conjecture of an 'original issue, _circa_ 1600,' is on the\r\nwhole plausible. In that case there was, somewhere, a poet capable of\r\nanticipating the particular cadences of _Sirena_ and _Agincourt_, and that\r\npoet is more likely to have been Drayton than another. See Ebsworth's\r\nedition for the Ballad Society (_Roxburghe Ballads_, vi. p. 460).\r\n\r\n[133] _Lycidas_ is almost too familiar, one might suppose, to need\r\ncomment, but such irreconcilable views have been held by different\r\nauthorities, from Dr. Johnson onwards, that it may not be idle to attempt\r\nto view the work critically in relation to pastoral tradition as a whole.\r\n\r\n[134] When Johnson went on to describe the form of the poem as 'easy,\r\nvulgar, and therefore disgusting,' he was but exhibiting a critical\r\nincapacity which seriously impairs his authority in literary matters.\r\n\r\n[135] For a detailed account of the poem, as well as for a number of\r\nparallel passages--as well as some of doubtful relevance--the reader may\r\nbe referred to F. W. Moorman's monograph. I use the text of G. Goodwin's\r\nedition of Browne's poems, with introduction by A. H. Bullen, 2 vols.,\r\n1894.\r\n\r\n[136] K. Windscheid professes to discover a different hand in the third\r\nbook, and is inclined to ascribe it to some imitator of Browne. Its merit\r\nis certainly not high, but it is no worse than parts of the former books;\r\nand Browne's work is so notoriously unequal that I can see no excuse for\r\ndepriving or relieving him of its authorship.\r\n\r\n[137]\r\n\r\n  The hatred which they bore was only this,\r\n  That every one did hate to do amiss;\r\n  Their fortune still was subject to their will;\r\n  Their want--O happy!--was the want of ill. (II. iii. 447.)\r\n\r\nMany readers may be inclined to pity poor men and women debarred from that\r\n\r\n  First of all joys that unto sin belong--\r\n  The sweet felicity of doing wrong.\r\n\r\n[138] Pail.\r\n\r\n[139] The translater was afterwards knighted. Who was the first person to\r\nascribe this translation to Thomas Wilcox, a certain 'very painful\r\nminister of God's word,' I am not sure. The mistake has, however, been\r\nconstantly repeated, and led Underhill, in his able monograph on _Spanish\r\nLiterature in England_, to give a detailed account of Wilcox and his\r\nwholly chimerical connexion with the spread of Spanish influence in this\r\ncountry. The translation is preserved in the British Museum, Addit. MS.\r\n18,638, and contains the translator's name perfectly clearly written, both\r\non the title-page and at the end of the dedicatory epistle to Fulke\r\nGreville. This MS. is a copy of the original made by the translator\r\nhimself about 1617, and bears on the fly-leaf the name 'Dorothy Grevell.'\r\nThe title-page is worth transcribing: 'Diana de Monte mayor done out of\r\nSpanish by Thomas Wilsõ Esquire, In the yeare 1596 & dedicated to the Erle\r\nof Southamptõ who was then uppon y'e Spanish voiage w'th my Lord of\r\nEssex--Wherein under the names and vailes of Sheppards and theire Lovers\r\nare covertly discoursed manie noble actions & affections of the Spanish\r\nnation, as is of y'e English of [_sic_] y't admirable & never enough\r\npraised booke of S'r.

All needful\r\napparatus for the study of the story will of course be found in Furness'\r\n'Variorum' edition of the play.\r\n\r\n[142] Macaulay once remarked of the _Faery Queen_, that few and weary are\r\nthe readers who are in at the death of the Blatant Beast. It might with\r\nequal or even greater force be contended that most readers are asleep ere\r\nthe Arcadian princesses in Sidney's romance are rescued from the power of\r\nCecropia.\r\n\r\n[143] Into purely bibliographical questions, such as the history of the\r\nEdinburgh edition of 1599, it is of course impossible to enter here.\r\n\r\n[144] Letter in the State Papers. See Introduction to Sommer's facsimile\r\nof the first edition, 1891.\r\n\r\n[145] Conversations with Drummond, X. Shakespeare Society, 1842, p. 10.\r\n\r\n[146] K. Brunhuber, to whose work on the _Arcadia_ (_Sir Philip Sidneys\r\nArcadia und ihre Nachläufer_, 1903) I am in a measure indebted, failing to\r\nfind many specific borrowings, is inclined to make light of Montemayor's\r\ninfluence. There can, however, be little question that, in general style\r\nand conception, Sidney, while influenced by the Greek romance, yet\r\nbelonged essentially to the Spanish school.\r\n\r\n[147] Analyses of the _Arcadia_ will be fouud in all works upon the novel\r\nfrom Dunlop to J. J. Jusserand and W. Raleigh. Perhaps the fullest, which\r\nis also provided with copious extracts, is that in the _Retrospective\r\nReview_, 1820, ii. p. 1.\r\n\r\n[148] An allegorical interpretation certainly found favour among the\r\ncritics of the time, and was advanced by Puttenham in his _Art of English\r\nPoesy_ (1589), even before the publication of the romance. See also Thomas\r\nWilson's allusion on the title-page of his translation from the _Diana_,\r\ngiven above (p. 141, note).\r\n\r\n[149] A critical edition remains, however, a desideratum.\r\n\r\n[150] See Jusserand's _English Novel in the time of Shakespeare_, 1890, p.\r\n274.\r\n\r\n[151] The later fashionable pastoral of French origin, with the _Astrée_\r\nas its type and chief representative, does not concern us, or at most\r\nconcerns us so indirectly as not to warrant our lingering over it here.\r\n\r\n[152] I should at once say that the view of the development of the\r\npastoral drama adopted above is not endorsed by all scholars. To have set\r\nforth at length the considerations upon which it is based would have\r\nswollen beyond all bounds an introductory section of my work. Since,\r\nhowever, the question is one of considerable interest, I have added what I\r\nbelieve to be a fairly full and impartial discussion in the form of an\r\nappendix.\r\n\r\n[153] 'Orfeo cantando giugne all' Inferno' is one of the stage directions.\r\n\r\n[154] For an elaborate example (1547) of this kind of stage, on which\r\nvarious localities were simultaneously represented, see Petit de\r\nJulleville, _Histoire de la langue et de la littérature française_, ii.\r\npp. 416-7.\r\n\r\n[155] Concerning the play see the account given by Symonds, together with\r\nhis admirable translation in _Sketches and Studies in Italy and Greece_,\r\nii. p. 345, also an elaborate essay, 'L'Orfeo del Poliziano alla corte di\r\nMantova,' by Isidoro del Lungo, in the _Nuova antologia_ for August, 1881,\r\nand A. D'Ancona, _Origini del teatro italiano_, ii. pp. 2 and 106. The\r\nstandard edition of Poliziano's Italian works, that by Carducci, is\r\nunfortunately not in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[156] A note concerning the use of the term 'nymph' may save confusion.\r\nCreizenach remarks that the introduction of a nymph as the beloved of a\r\nshepherd is a peculiarity of the renaissance pastoral which manifestly\r\nowes its origin to Boccaccio's _Ninfale fiesolano_ (_Geschichte des\r\nneueren Dramas_, ii. p. 196). In so far as this view implies that the\r\n'nymphs' of pastoral convention are the same order of beings as those\r\neither of the _Ninfale_ or of classical myth, it appears to me utterly\r\nerroneous. The 'nymphs' who love the shepherds in the renaissance\r\npastorals are nothing but shepherdesses. The confusion no doubt began with\r\nBoccaccio. The nymph of Diana in the _Ninfale_ is, as we have already\r\nseen, nothing but a nun in pagan disguise. The nymphs of the _Ameto_ are\r\nrepresented as of the classical type, but their amorous confessions reveal\r\nthem as in nowise differing from mortal woman. The gradual change in the\r\nconnotation of the word is one of the results of the blending of Christian\r\nand classical ideas. The original elemental or local spirits even in Greek\r\nmyth acquired some of the characteristics of votaries (as in the legeud of\r\nCalisto), and these Christian tradition tended to accentuate, while\r\npopular romance, and in many cases contemporary manners, facilitated the\r\nconnecting of such characters with tales of secret passion. Gradually,\r\nhowever, the idea of illicit love gave place to one merely of unrestrained\r\nnatural desire, the religious elements of the character were forgotten as\r\nthe supernatural had been earlier, and 'nymph' came to be no more than the\r\nfeminine of 'shepherd' in an ideal society which by its freedom of\r\nintercourse, as by its honesty of dealing, presented a complete contrast\r\nto the polished circles of aristocratic Italy.\r\n\r\n[157] A small circular picture in _chiaroscuro_ among the arabesques of\r\nthe _cappella nova_ in the cathedral at Orvieto. It represents the\r\nyouthful Orpheus crowned with the laureate wreath playing before Pluto and\r\nProserpine upon a fiddle or crowd of antique pattern. At his feet lies\r\nEurydice, while around are spirits of the other world.\r\n\r\n[158] In some passages of this speech the resemblance with Ovid is very\r\nclose:\r\n\r\n  famaque si ueteris non est mentita rapinae,\r\n  uos quoque iunxit Amor...\r\n  omnia debentur nobis, paulumque morati\r\n  serius aut citius sedem properamus ad unam...\r\n  haec quoque, cum iustos matura peregerit annos,\r\n  iuris erit uestri; pro munere poscimus usum.\r\n  quod si fata negant ueniam pro coniuge, certum est\r\n  nolle redire mihi: leto gaudete duorum. (_Met_. x. 28, &c.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[159] Cf. _Amores_, II. xii, ll. 1, 2, 5, and 16.\r\n\r\n[160] This interpretation of the passion of Orpheus, characteristic as it\r\nis of renaissance thought, was not original. Though unknown in early\r\ntimes, it is found in Phanocles, a poet probably of the third or fourth\r\ncentury B. C.\r\n\r\n[161] So original: revision 'oè oè.'\r\n\r\n[162] The earliest edition I have seen is that contained in the 'Opere' of\r\nJune 10, 1507, where the heading runs: 'Fabula di Caephalo cõposta dal\r\nSignor Nicolo da Correggia a lo Illustrissimo. D. Hercole & da lui\r\nrepsentata al suo florẽtissimo Populo di Ferrara nel. M. cccc. lxxxvi.\r\nadi. xxi. Ianuarii.' In this edition, printed at Venice by Manfrido Bono\r\nde Monteferrato, the works are said to be 'Stampate nouamente: & ben\r\ncorrette.' Bibliographers record no edition previous to 1510. The date in\r\nthe heading is either a misprint, or refers to the year 1486-7 according\r\nto the Venetian reckoning. See D'Ancona, _Origini del teatro_, ii. p.\r\n128-9. Symonds (_Renaissance_, v. p. 120) quotes some Latin lines as from\r\nthe prologue to this play. This is an error. He has misread D'Ancona, to\r\nwhom he refers (ed. 1877), and from whom he evidently copied the\r\nquotation. The lines actually occur in the prologue to a Latin play on the\r\nsubject of the taking of Granada.\r\n\r\n[163] Rossi, _Battista Guarini ed il Pastor Fido_, 1886, p. 171, note 2.\r\n\r\n[164] I do not, of course, mean that no mythological plays were produced\r\nbetween the days of Correggio and those of Beccari, but that they show no\r\nsigns of consistent development in a pastoral or indeed in any other\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n[165] _Il Verato secondo_, 1593, p. 206.\r\n\r\n[166] _Compendio della poesia tragicomica, tratto dai duo Verati_, 1602,\r\npp. 49-50.\r\n\r\n[167] In this and the following section I have used the texts of the\r\nexceedingly useful collection of _Drammi de' boschi_ in the 'Biblioteca\r\nclassica economica,' which comprises the _Aminta, Pastor fido, Filli di\r\nSciro_, and _Alceo_.\r\n\r\n[168] Symonds, in dealing with Tasso in the sixth volume of his _Italian\r\nRenaissance_, lays, to my mind very justly, considerable stress upon this\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n[169] Quoted by Serassi, Tasso's biographer, in his preface to the Bodoni\r\nedition of the play (Crisopoli, 1789), p. 8.\r\n\r\n[170] See Angelo Solerti, _Vita di T. Tasso_, Torino, Loescher, 1895, i.\r\np. 181, &c. Carducci, 'Storia dell' _Aminta_,' the third of the _Saggi_,\r\n80, 1st edition.\r\n\r\n[171] Leigh Hunt pointed out, in some interesting if rather uncritical\r\nremarks prefixed to his translation of the _Aminta_ (London, 1820), that\r\nsome at any rate of the regular choruses cannot have formed part of the\r\noriginal composition. In fact the first edition (Aldus, 1581) contains\r\nthose to Acts I and V only; that to Act II appeared in the second edition\r\n(Ferrara, 1581), and also in the collected _Rime_ (Aldus, 1581); the rest\r\nwere added in the Aldine quarto of 1590.\r\n\r\n[172] Supposing always that this representation, of which Filippo\r\nBaldinucci, in his _Notizie dei professori del disegno_ (sec. iv, dec.\r\nvii; 1688, p. 102), has left a glowing account, was a representation of\r\nthe _Aminta_, and not, as some have maintained, of the _Intrichi d'\r\namore_, another play sometimes ascribed to Tasso.\r\n\r\n[173] Amore had already spoken the prologue to Lodovico Dolce's _Dido_;\r\nand a mythological play by Sannazzaro, of which the opening alone is\r\nextant, introduces Venus in pursuit of her son, and warning the ladies of\r\nthe audience against his wiles (Creizenach, ii. p. 209). The prologue to\r\nthe _Pastor fido_ is put into the mouth of the river-god Alfeo, that of\r\nBonarelli's _Filli di Sciro_, which begins with another Ovidian\r\nreminiscence (_Amores_, I. xiii. 40), and was written by Marino, is spoken\r\nby a personification of night, that of Ongaro's _Alceo_ by Venus, of\r\nCastelletti's _Amarilli_ by 'Apollo in habito pastorale,' of Cristoforo\r\nLauro's _Frutti d'amore_ by Janus in similar garb, of Cesana's _Prova\r\namoroso_, by Hercules. The list might be extended indefinitely. Contarini,\r\nat the beginning of the next century, followed precedent less closely; his\r\n_Finta Fiammetta_ has a dramatic prologue introducing Venus, Cupid,\r\nAnteros (the avenger of slighted love), and a chorus of _amoretti_; that\r\nof his _Fida ninfa_ is spoken by the shade of Petrarch.\r\n\r\n[174] Most of the identifications made by Menagio in his edition, Paris,\r\n1650, have generally been accepted since, except by Fontanini, who would\r\nidentify Pigna with Mopso. There seems, however, to be little doubt\r\npossible on the point, though it is not to Tasso's credit. For an audience\r\nconversant with the inner life of the court, the references to Elpino\r\ncontained whole volumes of contemporary scandal. In Licori we may see\r\nLucrezia Bendidio. This lady, the wife of Count Paolo Machiavelli, and\r\nsister-in-law of Guarini, is said to have been the mistress of Cardinal\r\nLuigi d' Este; but Pigna, too, courted her, and brooked no rivalry on the\r\npart of fledgling poets. Tasso appears to have paid her imprudent\r\nattention in the early days of his residence at Ferrara, and thus incurred\r\nthe secretary's wrath. The princess Leonora remonstrated with her poet on\r\nhis folly, and Tasso, by way of palinode, wrote a fulsome commentary on\r\nthree of Pigna's wooden _canzoni_, ranking them with Petrarch's. Tasso is\r\nappareutly allnding to this incident when he puts into Elpino's mouth the\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n  Quivi con Tirsi ragionando andava\r\n  Pur di colei che nell' istessa rete\r\n  Lui prima e me dappoi ravvolse e strinse;\r\n  E preponendo alla sua fuga, al suo\r\n  Libero stato il mio dolce servigio. (V. i. 61.)\r\n\r\nThe origin of the name 'Licori' may possibly, as Carducci points out (p.\r\n94), be sought in an epigram, _Ad Licorim_, found among Pigna's Latin\r\n_Carmina_ (1553). The whole incident throws a curious light on the\r\npettiness of the Ferrarese Court, a characteristic in which it was,\r\nhowever, not peculiar. (See Rossi, pp. 34, &c.) It is perhaps worth while\r\nmentioning that by the _antro dell' Aurora_ was no doubt intended the room\r\nin the castle, said to have formed part of the private apartments of\r\nLeonora, still known as the _sala dell' Aurora_, from a wretched fresco on\r\nthe ceiling by the local artist Dosso Dossi.\r\n\r\n[175] _Aminta_, I. i; _Canace_, IV. ii.\r\n\r\n[176] _Lettere del Guarini_, Veneta, Ciotti, 1615, p. 92. See Rossi,\r\n56^{1}\r\n\r\n[177] I have already had occasion to point out that, from the time of\r\nBoccaccio onwards, a nymph of Diana might represent a nun, but the whole\r\nof Silvia's relations with Dafne make it plain that she is in no way vowed\r\nto virginity. Her being represented as a follower of Diana implies no more\r\nthan that she is fancy-free, and so in a sense under the protection of the\r\nvirgin goddess. This use of the phrase is as old as Theocritus: 'Artemis,\r\nbe not wrathful, thy votary breaks her vow' (_Idyl_ 27). And it is so used\r\nby Silvia herself in her proud and petulant retort to Aminta: 'Pastor, non\r\nmi toccar; son di Diana' (III. i).\r\n\r\n[178] The idea passed from Italian into English verse:\r\n\r\n            tell me why\r\n  This goblin 'honour,' by the world enshrined,\r\n  Should make men atheists, and not women kind--\r\n\r\nto improve upon the exceedingly neat bowdlerization which the Rev. J. W.\r\nEbsworth has sought to palm off as the genuine text of Tom Carew.\r\n\r\n[179] We have, in the passages quoted, a foretaste of the priggish\r\nextravagance of the _Faithful Shepherdess_. That there should have been\r\nfound critics to combine just but wholly otiose condemnation of Cloe with\r\nreverential appreciation of the absurdities of Clorin and Thenot, and to\r\nclap applause to the self-conscious virtue, little removed from smugness,\r\nin which the 'moral grandeur' of the Lady of the Ludlow masque is clothed,\r\nis indeed a striking witness to the tyranny of conventional morality. If\r\nvirginal purity were in fact the hypocritical convention which it is to\r\nsome extent possible to condone in the _Aminta_, but which becomes wholly\r\nloathsome in the work of Fletcher, the sooner it disappeared from the\r\nregion of practical ethics the better for the moral health of humanity.\r\n\r\n[180] Menagio's edition is said to have appeared in 1650, but I have only\r\nseen the edition of 1655, which I also notice is the date given by Weise\r\nand Pèrcopo (p. 319). The play is said to have been printed in Italy alone\r\nsome two hundred times; there are twenty French translations, five German,\r\nat least nine English, several in Spanish and other languages. A version\r\nin the Slavonic Illyrian dialect appeared in 1598; a Latin one in iambic\r\ntrimeters by Andrea Hiltebrando, a Pomeranian physician, in 1615; another\r\nin modern Greek in 1745. See Carducci, p. 99.\r\n\r\n[181] Published, together with Paglia's reply, by Antonio Bulifon in his\r\n_Lettere memorabili_, Naples, 1698, iii. p. 307. The play had already been\r\nadversely criticized by Francesco Patrizi and Gian Vincenzo Gravina.\r\n\r\n[182] 'L'Aminta difeso e illustrato da G. Fontanini,' Roma, 1700. Another\r\nedition appeared in 1730 at Venice, with further annotations by Uberto\r\nBenvoglienti.\r\n\r\n[183] It is, however, perfectly true that the play, together with the\r\nwritings in its defence and the notes, to be considered later, occupied\r\nthe attention of the author for a period of fully twenty years, and it is\r\npossibly thus that the tradition arose. I may say that throughout this\r\nsection I am under deep obligations to Rossi's monograph.\r\n\r\n[184] Rossi, p. 183. I shall return to the point.\r\n\r\n[185] In later days he was often called Giovanbattista, but the addition\r\nis without authority, in spite of its appearance in the British Museum\r\ncatalogue.\r\n\r\n[186] This preliminary history is drawn, as Guarini himself points out in\r\nhis notes of 1602, from Pausanias (VII. 21), though less closely than he\r\nthere implies. The rest of the plot he claimed as original, but it is to a\r\nlarge extent merely a rehandling of the same motive.\r\n\r\n[187] Carino is said to represent Guarini in the same manner as Tirsi does\r\nTasso.\r\n\r\n[188] There is a legend that this scene was placed on the Index. This,\r\nanyhow, cannot refer to the _Index Librorum Prohibitorum_, but only to the\r\n_Index Expurgatorius_, which was at no time an officiai publication. But\r\nthe whole story appears to be without foundation.\r\n\r\n[189] In comparing the two pieces, it is worth remembering that, whereas\r\nthe _Aminta_ contains about 2,000 lines, the _Pastor fido_ runs to close\r\nupon 7,000.\r\n\r\n[190] _Storia della letteratura italiana nel secolo XVI_, Milano, 1880,\r\npp. 244-7. See Rossi, p. 264. His argument is that it anticipated a revolt\r\nagainst the conventional nature of domestic love, reflecting better than\r\nany other dramatic work the ideas that towards the end of the\r\n_cinquecento_ were, according to him, leading in the direction of a moral\r\nregeneration of Italian Society. It is, however, difficult to reconcile\r\nhis theory with what we know of Italy in the days of the\r\ncounter-reformation; while it may at the same time be doubted whether a\r\ntone of anaemic sentimentality is, in itself, preferable to one of cynical\r\nconvention. It should be added that there is little regeneration of\r\ndomestic love to be found in the partly pathetic and partly sordid tragedy\r\nof Guarini's own family.\r\n\r\n[191] The quotations are from the opening scene of either play. The\r\nparallel is that selected by Symonds for quotation, and is among the most\r\nstriking examples of Guarini's method, but similar instances might be\r\ncollected from almost every scene.\r\n\r\n[192] G. B. Manso, _Vita di T. Tasso_, Venezia, Denchino, 1621, p. 329.\r\nCarducci, p. 99.\r\n\r\n[193] 'Il Pastor Fido Tragicomedia Pastorale di Battista Guarini, Dedicata\r\nal Ser'mo. D. Carlo Emanuele Duca di Sauoia, &c. Nelle Reali Nozze di S. A.\r\ncon la Ser'ma. Infante D. Caterina d'Austria.' The tradition of a\r\nperformance on this occasion dates from early in the seventeenth century,\r\nand is endorsed by the poet's nephew and biographer, Alessandro Guarini.\r\nIt is in part due to a confusion of words: the play was _presentato_, but\r\nnot _rappresentato_.\r\n\r\n[194] Guarini, _Lettere_, Venetia, Ciotti, 1615, p. 174. Rossi, 228^{7}.\r\n\r\n[195] At least one of these, a worthless production by a certain Niccolo\r\nAverara, is extant. That of 1598 was probably spoken by Hymen. Rossi, pp.\r\n232-3.\r\n\r\n[196] It has sometimes been supposed that the Baldini edition, Ferrara,\r\n1590, was the earlier, but Guarini's letter is conclusive.\r\n\r\n[197] Of this edition the British Museum possesses a magnificent copy on\r\nlarge and thick paper, bearing on the title-page the inscription: 'Al\r\nSer^{mo}. Principe di Vinegia Marin Grimani,' showing that it was the\r\npresentation copy to the Doge at the time of publication. Another copy on\r\nlarge but not on thick paper is in my own possession, and has on the\r\ntitle-page the remains of a similar inscription beginning apparently 'All\r\nIll^{mo} et R^{mo}...' I rather suspect it of being the copy presented to\r\nthe ecclesiastic, whoever he was, who represented the Congregation of the\r\nIndex at Venice. Innumerable editions followed; I have notes of no less\r\nthan fifty during the half-century succeeding publication, i.e. 1590-1639.\r\n\r\n[198] The authorship of the notes is placed beyond doubt by a letter of\r\nGuarini's, otherwise it might have been doubted whether even he could have\r\nbeen guilty of the fulsome self-laudation they contain. On the controversy\r\nsee Rossi, pp. 238-43.\r\n\r\n[199] Certain modern writers have shown themselves worthy descendants of\r\nthe criticaster of Vicenza by insisting that the play should properly be\r\ncalled the _Pastorella fida_. Guarini was weak enough to reply to\r\nMalacreta's carpings in his notes, and thereby exposed himself to similar\r\nattacks from posterity.\r\n\r\n[200] The absurdity lies of course in the commanding merit ascribed to the\r\npiece. As Saintsbury has pointed out in his _History of Criticism_, had\r\nAristotle known the romantic drama of the renaissance, the _Poetics_ would\r\nhave been largely another work.\r\n\r\n[201] Summo evidently thought that Pescetti's defence at least was the\r\nwork of Guarini himself. There is no evidence that this was so, but Rossi\r\nconsiders it not improbable that Guarini at least directed the labours of\r\nhis supporters.\r\n\r\n[202] It is unnecessary to enter into any further discussion of these\r\nplays. The following titles, however, quoted by Stiefel in his review of\r\nRossi, may be mentioned. Scipione Dionisio, _Amore cortese_, 1570 (?) (not\r\nthe Alessandro Dionisio whose _ecloga_, entitled _Amorosi sospiri_, with\r\nintermezzos of a mythological character, was printed in 1599); Niccolò\r\ndegli Angeli, _Ligurino_, 1574 (so Allacci, _Drammaturgia_, 1755; the only\r\nedition in the British Museum is dated 1594; Venus and Silenus are among\r\nthe characters, and the prologue is spoken by 'Tempo'); Cesare della\r\nValle, _Filide_, 1579; Giovanni Fratta, _La Nigella_, 1580; Cristoforo\r\nCastelletti, _Amarilli_, 1580 (which edition, though given by Allacci,\r\nappears to be now unknown, as is also the date of composition; a second\r\nedition appeared in 1582; the prologue was spoken by 'Apollo in habito\r\npastorale,' and Ongaro contributed a commendatory sonnet); Giovanni Donato\r\nCuchetti, _La Pazzia_, 1581; Pietro Cresci, _Tirena_, 1584; Alessandro\r\nMirari, _Mauriziano_, 1584; Dionisio Rondinelli, _Galizia_, 1583 (his\r\n_Pastor vedovo_ was printed in 1599, with a prologue spoken by\r\n'Primavera,' and an echo scene).\r\n\r\n[203] Preface to the Bodoni edition of the _Aminta_, p. 12.\r\n\r\n[204] This episode of the double love of Celia formed the subject of an\r\nattack on the play. The author wrote an elaborate defence which was\r\nprinted at Ancona in 1612. It runs to 221 quarto pages.\r\n\r\n[205] I am aware that attempts have been made to find evidence of Italian\r\ninfluence in Lyly, but of this later.\r\n\r\n[206] The piece appeared anonymously, but the authorship is attested by\r\nNashe in his preface to Greene's _Menaphon_, 1589. Some songs from the\r\nplay also appear over Peele's signature in _England's Helicon_, 1600. I\r\nhave quoted from A. H. Bullen's edition of Peele's works, 2 vols. 1888.\r\n\r\n[207] Fraunce's translation in his _Ivychurch_ (_vide post_), and J.\r\nWolfe's edition, together with the _Pastor fido_, both 1591.\r\n\r\n[208] Like Dove. Cf. p. 98.\r\n\r\n[209] i.e. coupled impartially with its reward.\r\n\r\n[210] Umpire.\r\n\r\n[211] Groves.\r\n\r\n[212] The entry of the piece to R. Jones, on July 26, 1591, in the\r\nStationers' Register, coupled with the fact that _England's Parnassus_\r\nquotes almost entirely from printed works, puts this practically beyond\r\ndoubt. It is of course possible that a copy may yet be discovered.\r\n\r\n[213] Dr. Henry Jackson, than whom no classical scholar has devoted more\r\nstudy to the Elizabethan drama, draws my attention to the fact that a\r\nsomewhat indelicate passage in the play, obscurely hinted at in Drummond's\r\nnotes (ed. Bullen, ii. p. 366), evidently forms the basis of that poet's\r\nown epigram 'Of Nisa' (ed. Turnbull, p. 104).\r\n\r\n[214] Two other plays of Lyly's appear at first sight to present pastoral\r\nfeatures. There are five 'shepherds' among the dramatis personae of\r\n_Mydas_, but they appear in one scene only (IV. ii), and merely represent\r\nthe common people, introduced to comment on the actions of the king. The\r\nnames, as is usual with Lyly, except in the case of comic characters, are\r\nclassical. The other play is _Mother Bombie_, which, however, is nothing\r\nbut a comedy of low life, combining the tradition of the Latin comedy with\r\nthe native farce, which goes back through _Gammer Gurton_ to the old\r\ninterludes. It contains a good deal of honest fun and a notable lack of\r\nEuphuism.\r\n\r\n[215] For many years, indeed, his romance continued to run through\r\never-fresh editions, that of 1636 being the twelfth. It is clear, however,\r\nthat its public had changed.\r\n\r\n[216] It is a curious fact that the authorship of these songs, though it\r\nhas never been seriously questioned, rests on very uncertain evidence. I\r\nmay refer to an article on the subject in the _Modern Language Review_ for\r\nOctober, 1905, i. p. 43.\r\n\r\n[217] A play entitled 'Iphis and Ianthe, or A marriage without a man,' was\r\nentered on the Stationers' Register on June 29, 1660, as the work of\r\nShakespeare.\r\n\r\n[218] Lyly may very possibly have known the story of Hesione cited by R. W.\r\nBond (ii. 421), but it presents no particular points of similarity, and the\r\noutline of the legend was of course common property. A similar sacrifice\r\nforms an episode in _Orlando furioso_, VIII. 52, &c.; the sacrifice of a\r\nyouth to an _orribile serpe_ also forms the central incident in Orazio\r\nSerono's _Fida Armilla_, 1610; while the motive of the annual sacrifice\r\noccurs of course in the _Pastor fido_.\r\n\r\n[219] There can be little doubt as to the identity of the 'Commoedie of\r\nTitirus and Galathea,' entered on the Stationers' Register under date\r\nApril 1, 1585; and now that, thanks to Bond's researches, it is evident\r\nthat the reference to _Octogesimus octavus mirabilis annus_ (see III. iii)\r\nwas no _ex post facto_ prophecy, but borrowed from Richard Harvey's\r\n_Astrological Discourse_ of 1583, there is no reason to suppose a double\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n[220] Bond argues in favour of the extant text being mutilated, and\r\nrepresenting a late revival about 1600. I am not prepared, and in the\r\npresent place certainly not concerned, to dispute his hypothesis; whatever\r\nthe cause, the literary result is unsatisfactory, and from his remarks\r\nconcerning its dramatic merits I must emphatically dissent.\r\n\r\n[221] Bond's emendation, undoubtedly correct, for _nip_ of the quarto.\r\n\r\n[222] This story, strangely characterized as 'extremely attractive' by\r\nBond, is elaborated from that given by Ovid in the eighth book of the\r\n_Metamorphoses_. I have elsewhere alluded to the theory of Italian\r\npastoral influence in Lyly. I had in mind L. L. Schiicking's monograph on\r\n_Die stofflichen Beziehungen der englischen Komodie zur italienischen bis\r\nLilly_, Halle, 1901, but must here state that to my mind he has completely\r\nfailed to prove his thesis. I need not enter into details in this place,\r\nbut may refer to Bond's discussion in his 'Note on Italian influence in\r\nLyly's plays' (ii. p. 473). There is, however, one passage in _Love's\r\nMetamorphosis_ (not mentioned by Schucking) which suggests a reminiscence\r\nof the _Aminta_; Cupid, namely, describes himself (V. i.) as 'such a god\r\nthat maketh thunder fall out of Joves hand, by throwing thoughts into his\r\nheart.' Compare the lines in Tasso's Prologue:\r\n\r\n            un dio...\r\n  Che fa spesso cader di mano a Marte\r\n  La sanguinosa spada...\r\n  E le folgori eterne al sommo Giove.\r\n\r\nI give the parallel for what it is worth. So far as I am aware it is the\r\nonly one which can claim the least plausibility, and alone it is clearly\r\ninsufficient to prove any borrowing on the part of the English playwright.\r\n\r\n[223] Bond adduces some fairly strong reasons for supposing it later than\r\n1590. A. W. Ward was evidently unable to make up his mind upon the\r\nquestion, and treats the play at the head of the list of Lyly's works, in\r\nwhich it seems to me that he hardly does justice to his critical powers.\r\n\r\n[224] A very similar reminiscence of Marlowe's rhythm: /p And think I wear\r\na rich imperial crowne, p/ occurs in the old play of _King Leir_, which\r\nmust belong to about the same date, _c._ 1592.\r\n\r\n[225] It is possible, though of course by no means necessary, that we have\r\na specifie reminiscence of the lines in _Faustus_:\r\n\r\n  More lovely than the monarch of the sky\r\n  In wanton Arethusa's azur'd arms. (Sc. xv.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[226] I have of course not concerned myself with those mythological plays\r\nwhich offer no pastoral features. Nor is it possible to go into the\r\nquestion of the Latin plays performed at the Universities. I may, however,\r\nmention the _Atalanta_ of Philip Parsons, a short piece preserved in the\r\nBritish Museum, MS. Harl. 6924, and dedicated to no less a person than\r\nLaud, when President of St. John's, Oxford, a position he held from 1611\r\nto 1615. The play is founded upon the Boeotian legend of Atalanta, though\r\nthe laying of the scene in Arcadia would appear to indicate a confusion\r\nwith the other version. Pastoral characters and scenes are introduced.\r\n\r\n[227] See the epistle dedicatory to the Countess of Pembroke, prefixed to\r\nthe _Ivychurch_, in which the translation appeared, 1591.\r\n\r\n[228] The choruses to Acts III and IV are omitted, which proves that\r\nFraunce worked, as we should expect, from some edition previous to the\r\nAldine quarto of 1590. There are also certain unimportant alterations in\r\nthe translation from Watson. For a more detailed examination of Fraunce's\r\nrelation to his Italian original, see an article by E. Koeppel on 'Die\r\nenglischen Tasso-Übersetzungen des 16. Jahrhunderts,' in _Anglia_, vol. xi\r\n(1889), p. 11.\r\n\r\n[229] 'Phillis, alas, tho' thou live, another by this will be dying' would\r\nbe a more elegant as well as more correct rendering of 'Oimè! tu vivi;\r\nAltri non già': it would, however, not scan according to Fraunce's rules.\r\n\r\n[230] Numerous French translations were, moreover, available for such as\r\nhappened to be more familiar with that language.\r\n\r\n[231] Though not a point of much importance, I may as well take the\r\nopportunity of endeavouring to clear up the singular confusion which has\r\nsurrounded the authorship. The ascription to John Reynolds rests\r\nultimately upon the authority of Edward Phillips, in whose _Theatrum\r\nPoetarum_, 1675, we find _s.v._ Torquato Tasso the note (pt. ii, p. 186):\r\n'Amintas, a Pastoral, elegantly translated into English by John Reynolds.'\r\nWho this John was is open to question. The _Dic. Nat. Biog._ recognizes\r\nthree John Reynolds in the first half of the seventeenth century: (1) John\r\nReynolds, or Reinolds (1584-1614), epigrammatist, fellow of New College,\r\nOxford; (2) John Reynolds, of Exeter, (_fl._ 1621-50), author of _God's\r\nRevenge against Murder_, and of translations from French and Dutch; and\r\n(3) Sir John Reynolds, colonel in the Parliamentary army. The British\r\nMuseum Catalogue, on the other hand, distinguishes between John Reynolds,\r\nof Exeter, author of _God's Revenge_ and other works, and John Reynolds\r\nthe translator (to whom the _Aminta_ is tentatively ascribed). I am not\r\naware of any authority for this distinction, though there is nothing in\r\nthe composition of _God's Revenge_ to make one suppose the author capable\r\nof producing the translation of the _Aminta_. On the other hand, it must\r\nbe admitted that the incidental verse in some of his other works, notably\r\nin the _Flower of Fidelity_, a romance published in 1650, is distinctly on\r\na more respectable level than his prose. The ascription, however, to John\r\nReynolds has not very much to support it. Phillips' authority is\r\nsecond-rate at best, and is not likely to be at its best in the present\r\ncase. It is indeed surprising that he should have been acquainted with\r\nthis early translation rather than with that by John Dancer, which\r\nappeared in 1660, and must have been far more generally known at the end\r\nof the seventeenth century. The first to identify the translator with\r\nHenry Reynolds was, so far as I am aware, Mary A. Scott, in her valuable\r\nseries of papers on 'Elizabethan Translations from the Italian,' in the\r\nPublications of the Modern Language Association of America (vol. xi. p.\r\n112); and the same view was taken independently by the writer of a notice\r\nin the _Dic. Nat. Biog._ This ascription is based upon the entry in the\r\nStationers' Register, which runs: '7º Novembris 1627. William Lee. Entred\r\nfor his Copye under the handes of Sir Henry Herbert and both the wardens A\r\nbooke called Torquato Tassos Aminta Englished by Henry Reynoldes ...\r\nvj^{d}' (Arber, iv. p. 188). Several songs of his are extant, and an\r\nepistle of Drayton's is dedicated to him. This appears to me the more\r\nreasonable ascription of the two. The writer in the _Dic. Nat. Biog._\r\nfurther claims that the identity of the translator with Henry Reynolds is\r\nproved by internal evidence of style. I may add that Serassi, in his\r\nremarks prefixed to the Bodoni edition of the _Aminta_ (Parma, 1789),\r\nascribed the present translation to Oldmixon through a confusion of the\r\ndates 1628 and 1698.\r\n\r\n[232] Streams or inlets.\r\n\r\n[233] The unfortunate cacophony of the opening is the retribution on the\r\ntranslator for not having the courage to begin with a hypermetrical line.\r\n\r\n[234] Later translations of the _Aminta_ may be mentioned: John Oldmixon,\r\n1698; P. B. Du Bois, in prose, with Italian, 1726; William Ayre [1737];\r\nPercival Stockdale, 1770; and, lastly, the very graceful rendering by\r\nLeigh Hunt, 1820. As lately as 1900 a gentleman who need not be named had\r\nthe impertinence to publish, in an American series, a mediocre version of\r\nthe _Aminta_ as being 'Now first rendered into English.' I may mention\r\nthat some confusion has been introduced into the question of the date of\r\nDu Bois' translation by the wholly unwarranted opinion on the part of the\r\nB. M. catalogue that the second (undated) edition appeared _c._ 1650. I\r\nhave compared the two editions at the Bodleian, and have no doubt that the\r\nsecond belongs to _c._ 1730.\r\n\r\n[235] The facts are as follow. The entry on the Stationers' Register is\r\ndated September 16, 1601, and does not mention the translator's name. The\r\nfirst edition, quarto, 1602, contains a sonnet by Daniel, addressed to Sir\r\nEdward Dymocke, in which he refers to the translator as the knight's\r\n'kinde Countryman.' This is followed by 'A Sonnet of the Translator,\r\ndedicated to that honourable Knight his kinsman, Syr Edward Dymock.' After\r\nthis comes an epistle dedicatory addressed to Sir Edward, and signed by\r\nSimon Waterson, the publisher, dated 'London this last of December. 1601.'\r\nIn it the writer speaks of Sir Edward's 'nearenesse of kinne to the\r\ndeceased Translator.' The play was reprinted in 1633, in 12mo, with an\r\nepistle dedicatory by John Waterson to 'Charles Dymock, Esquire,'\r\nbeginning: 'That it may appeare unto the world, that you are Heire of what\r\never else was your Fathers, as well as of his vertues, I heere restore\r\nwhat formerly his gracious acceptance made onely his: Which as a\r\ntestimonie to all, that it received Life from none but him, was content to\r\nloose its being with us, since he ceased to bee.' Through the hyperbolical\r\nambiguity of this passage it clearly appears that Charles was Sir Edward's\r\nson, but not in the least that he was the translator as has been supposed,\r\nstill less that he was the son of the translator, as has also been\r\nsuggested. The play is first mentioned in the second edition (1782) of the\r\n_Biographia Dramatica_, where the translator is said to be a 'Mr. Dymock,'\r\nand Charles is identified as his son. This was copied in the 1812 edition,\r\nand also by Halliwell, while Mr. Hazlitt has the astonishing statement\r\nthat the version was by 'Charles Dymock and a second person unknown.' The\r\n_Dic. Nat. Biog._ does not recognize any of the persons concerned. There\r\nis, however, one curious piece of evidence which has been so far\r\noverlooked. In the list of plays, namely, appended by the publisher Edward\r\nArcher to his edition of the _Old Law_ in 1656, occurs the entry:\r\n'Faithfull Shepheardesse. C[omedy]. John Dymmocke.' The compiler has of\r\ncourse confused the translation with Fletcher's play, but the ascription\r\nis nevertheless interesting. If we insist on identifying the translator at\r\nall, it must be with this John Dymocke. The entries in Archer's list,\r\nhowever, are far too untrustworthy for their unsupported evidence to carry\r\nmuch weight. A translation 'by D. D. Gent. 12mo. 1633,' recorded by\r\nHalliwell and others, is evidently due to a series of blunders on the part\r\nof bibliographers, though what the origin of the initials is I have been\r\nunable to discover. They are probably due to Coxeter.\r\n\r\n[236] MS. Addit. 29,493.\r\n\r\n[237] I understand that an edition of Fanshawe's works is in preparation\r\nfor Mr. Bullen.\r\n\r\n[238] Later translations of the _Pastor fido_ appeared in 1782 [by\r\nWilliam Grove], and in 1809 [by William Clapperton?].\r\n\r\n[239] MS. Ff. ii. 9.\r\n\r\n[240] The allusion, which has hitherto escaped notice, will be found\r\nquoted below, p. 252 note.\r\n\r\n[241] In this note the _Pastor fido_ is said to have been 'Translated by\r\nsome Author before this,' but the context makes it evident that 'some' is\r\na misprint for 'the same.'\r\n\r\n[242] It might be objected that J. S. is called 'Gent,' while Sidnam is\r\ntermed esquire; but it should be remarked that in the MS. the 'Esq;' has\r\nbeen added in a later hand.\r\n\r\n[243] MS. Sloane 836, folio 76^{v}.\r\n\r\n[244] MS. Sloane 857, folio 195^{v}.\r\n\r\n[245] MS. Addit. 12,128. Another MS. in the Bodleian.\r\n\r\n[246] No doubt the Samuel Brooke who became Master in 1629. He was the\r\nbrother of the Christopher Brooke who appears in Wither's eclogues under\r\nthe pastoral name of Cuddie. Cf. p. 116.\r\n\r\n[247] There is something wrong with this date. The princes were at\r\nCambridge 2-4 March, 1612-13. (See Nichols' _James I_, iii. (iv.) p.\r\n1086-7. The date 'March 6' in ii. p. 607 is an error.) Probably 'Martij\r\n30º,' which appears in the University Library MS., as well as in several\r\nMSS. at Trinity, is a slip of the transcriber for 'Martij 3º,' which would\r\nset both day and year right. Nichols, indeed, gives the date as 'Martii\r\n3º,' but he refers to the Emmanuel MS., which, like the others, reads\r\n'30.'\r\n\r\n[248] MS. Ee. 5. 16.\r\n\r\n[249] An anonymous writer in B. M. MS. Harl. 7044, quoted by Nichols\r\n(_James I_, i. p. 553), has the following description: '_Veneris_, 30º\r\n_Augusti_ [1605]. There was an English play acted in the same place before\r\nthe Queen and young Prince, with all the Ladies and Gallants attending the\r\nCourt. It was penned by Mr. Daniel, and drawn out of Fidus Pastor, which\r\nwas sometimes acted by King's College men in Cambridge. I was not there\r\npresent, but by report it was well acted and greatly applauded. It was\r\nnamed \"Arcadia Reformed.\"' This has led Fleay into a strange error. '_The\r\nQueen's Arcadia_' he says _(Biog. Chron._ i. p. 110), 'although it is not\r\nknown to have been acted till 1605, Aug. 30, had been prepared earlier\r\n(and perhaps acted at Herbert's marriage, 1604, Dec. 27), for it is called\r\n\"_Arcadia, reformed_.\"' Of course the allusion is to the reformation of\r\nArcadia, not the revision of the play. The play was printed the following\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n[250] For further details concerning the occasion of this piece, as also\r\nfor information on the state of the text, I may refer to an article of\r\nmine in the _Modern Language Quarterly_ for August, 1903, vi. p. 59. The\r\nfirst edition appeared in 1615.\r\n\r\n[251] Grosart's edition, printed, not always very correctly, from the\r\ncollected works of 1623, offers too unsatisfactory a text for quotation. I\r\nhave therefore quoted from the edition of 1623 itself, corrected, where\r\nnecessary, by the separate editions, and, in the case of _Hymen's\r\nTriumph_, by Drummond's MS.\r\n\r\n[252] Dramatic prologues occur in some of the later Italian pastorals (see\r\np. 185, note). That to _Hymen's Triumph_ recalls the dialogue between\r\nComedy and Envy prefixed to _Mucedorus_.\r\n\r\n[253] Alexis is one of those characters whose appearance, while not\r\nessential to the plot, lends life to the romantic drama, and whose\r\nconspicuous absence in the neo-classic type is ill compensated by the\r\nprodigal introduction of superfluous confidants.\r\n\r\n[254] It is just possible that Daniel took a hint for this episode from\r\nDickenson's romance, _Arisbas_ (1594), meutioned above, p. 147.\r\n\r\n[255] The similarity between Silvia and Shakespeare's Viola and Beaumont's\r\nEuphrasia-Bellario is too obvious to need comment. It may, however, be\r\nremarked that in Noci's _Cintia_ (1594) the heroine returns home disguised\r\nas a boy, to find her lover courting another nymph. See p. 212.\r\n\r\n[256] This narrative has been much admired, notably by Lamb and Coleridge,\r\ncritics from whom it is not good to differ; but I must nevertheless\r\nconfess that, to my taste, Daniel's sentiment, here as elsewhere, is\r\ninclined to verge upon the fulsome and the ludicrous.\r\n\r\n[257] It is evident that this pompous inflation of style damaged the piece\r\nupon the stage, for on Feb. 10, 1613-4, John Chamberlain, writing to Sir\r\nDudley Carleton, described the performance as 'solemn and dull.'\r\n\r\n[258] The corresponding passage in the _Aminta_ (I. ii.) is marred by a\r\nseries of rather artificial conceits.\r\n\r\n[259] Architecture or building. A very rare use not recognized by the New\r\nEnglish Dictionary, though it is also found in Browne's _Britannia's\r\nPastorals_ (I. iv. 405):\r\n\r\n  To find an house ybuilt for holy deed,\r\n  With goodly architect, and cloisters wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n[260] Guarini had already called dreams (_Pastor fido_, I. iv):\r\n\r\n  Immagini del dì, guaste e corrotte\r\n  Dall' ombre della notte.\r\n\r\n\r\n[261] Saintsbury, in his _Elizabethan Literature_, insists, not\r\nunnaturally, on Daniel's lack of strength. Upon this Grosart commented in\r\nhis edition (iv. p. xliv.): 'This seems to me exceptionally uncritical....\r\nOne special quality of Samuel Daniel is the inevitableness with which he\r\nrises when any \"strong\" appeal is made to ... his imagination.' The\r\npartiality of an editor could surely go no further.\r\n\r\n[262] The prodigality of _Oh's_ and _Ah's_ is an obvious characteristic of\r\nhis verse, which may possibly have been in Jonson's mind when, in the\r\nprologue to the _Sad Shepherd_, he wrote:\r\n\r\n  But that no stile for Pastorall should goe\r\n  Current, but what is stamp'd with _Ah_, and _O_;\r\n  Who judgeth so, may singularly erre.\r\n\r\n\r\n[263] This could hardly be maintained as literally true were we to include\r\nthe Latin plays of the Universities. Of these, however, I propose to take\r\nmerely incidental notice. In no case do they appear to be of considerable\r\nimportance, and they are, as a rule, only preserved in MSS. which are\r\noften difficult of access. I may here mention one which reached the\r\ndistinction of print, and is of a more regularly Italian structure than\r\nmost. The title-page reads: 'Melanthe Fabula pastoralis acta cum Iacobus\r\nMagnae Brit. Franc. & Hiberniæ Rex, Cantabrigiam suam nuper inviseret,\r\nibidemq; Musarum, atque eius animi gratiâ dies quinque Commoraretur.\r\nEgerunt alumni Coll. San. et Individuae Trinitatis. Cantabrigiae.\r\nExcudebat Cantrellus Legge. Mart. 27. 1615.' The play was acted, according\r\nto the invaluable John Chamberlain, on March 10, 1614-5, and appears to\r\nhave made a very favourable impression. It belongs to the series of\r\nentertainments which included the representation of _Albumazar_, and was\r\nto have included that of Phineas Fletcher's _Sicelides_, had the king\r\nremained another night. The author of _Melanthe_ is said to have been 'Mr.\r\nBrookes,' probably the Dr. Samuel Brooke who had produced the\r\nalready-mentioned translation of Bonarelli's _Filli di Sciro_ two years\r\nbefore. See Nichols' _Progresses of James I_, iii. p. 55.\r\n\r\n[264] Fleay considers the _Faithful Shepherdess_ a joint production of\r\nBeaumont and Fletcher. The only external evidence in favour of this theory\r\nis a remark of Jonson's reported by Drummond: 'Flesher and Beaumont, ten\r\nyeers since, hath [_sic_] written the Faithfull Shipheardesse, a\r\nTragicomedie, well done.' Considering that the same authority makes Jonson\r\nascribe the _Inner Temple Masque_ to Fletcher, his statement as to the\r\n_Faithful Shepherdess_ cannot be allowed much weight, while I hardly think\r\nthat the fact of Beaumont having prefixed commendatory verses to Fletcher\r\nin the original edition can be set aside as lightly as Fleay appears to\r\nthink. He relies chiefly upon internal evidence, but in his _Biographical\r\nChronicle_, at any rate, does not venture upon a detailed division. For\r\nmyself, I can only discover one hand in the play, and that hand\r\nFletcher's. Fleay places the date of representation before July, 1608, on\r\naccount of an outbreak of the plague lasting from then to Nov. 1609, but\r\nA. H. Thorndike (_The Influence of Beaumont and Fletcher on Shakspere_,\r\nWorcester, Mass., 1901, p. 14) has shown good reason for believing that\r\ndramatic performances were much less interfered with by the plague than\r\nFleay imagined.\r\n\r\n[265] Most of these, it may be remarked, as well as the character of\r\nThenot and the unconventional rôle of the satyr, find parallels in the\r\nearlier stages of the Italian pastoral. The transformation-well recalls\r\nthe enchanted lake of the _Sacrifizio_; the introduction of a supernatural\r\nagent in the plot reminds us of the same play, as well as of Epicuro's\r\n_Mirzia_; the friendly satyr, of this latter, which may be, in its turn,\r\nindebted to the revised version of the _Orfeo_; the character of Thenot is\r\nanticipated in the _Sfortunato_. I give the resemblances for what they are\r\nworth, which is perhaps not much; it is unlikely that Fletcher should have\r\nbeen acquainted with any of the plays in question, though of course not\r\nimpossible. The magic taper appears to be a native superstition, a\r\nsurvival of the ordeal by fire.\r\n\r\n[266] Certain critics have suggested that the _Pastor fido_ might more\r\nappropriately have borne the title of Fletcher's play. This is absurd,\r\nsince it would mean giving the title-rôle to the wholly secondary Dorinda.\r\nPerhaps they failed to perceive that Mirtillo and not Silvio is the hero.\r\nWith Fletcher's play the case stands otherwise. There is absolutely\r\nnothing to show whether the title refers to the presiding genius of the\r\npiece, Clorin, faithful to the memory of the dead, or to the central\r\ncharacter, Amoret, faithful in spite of himself to her beloved Perigot. I\r\nincline to believe that it is the latter that is the 'faithful\r\nshepherdess,' since it might be contended that, in the conventional\r\nlanguage of pastoral, Clorin would be more properly described as the\r\n'constant shepherdess.' (Cf. II. ii. 130.)\r\n\r\n[267] See Homer Smith's paper on _Pastoral Influence in the English\r\nDrama_. His theory concerning the _Faithful Shepherdess_ will be found on\r\np. 407. Whatever plausibility there may be in the general idea, the\r\ndetailed application there put forward would appear to be a singular\r\ninstance of misapplied ingenuity in pursuance of a preconceived idea.\r\n\r\n[268] 'Poems' [1619], p. 433. Compare Boccaccio's account of pastoral\r\npoetry already quoted, p. 18, note.\r\n\r\n[269] One fault, which even the beauty of the verse fails to conceal, is\r\nthe introduction of all sorts of stilted and otiose allusions to\r\nsheepcraft, which only serve to render yet more apparent the inherent\r\nabsurdity of the artificial pastoral. These Tasso and Guarini had had the\r\ngood taste to avoid, but we have already had occasion to notice them in\r\nthe case of Bonarelli. Daniel is likewise open to censure on this score.\r\n\r\n[270] I quote, of course, from Dyce's text, but have for convenience added\r\nthe line numbers from F. W. Moorman's edition in the 'Temple Dramatists.'\r\n\r\n[271] The officious critic must be forgiven for remarking that the satyr\r\nis not, as might be supposed from this speech, suddenly tamed by Clorin's\r\nbeauty and virtue, but shows himself throughout as of a naturally gentle\r\ndisposition. Consequently Clorin's argument that it is the mysterious\r\npower of virginity that has guarded her from attack and subdued his savage\r\nnature appears a little fatuous.\r\n\r\n[272] Specifically from 'wanton quick desires' and 'lustful heat.' One is\r\nalmost tempted to imagine that the author is laughing in his sleeve when\r\nwe discover of what little avail the solemn ceremony has been.\r\n\r\n[273] In 1658 there appeared a Latin translation, under the title of _La\r\nFida pastora,_ by 'FF. Anglo-Britannus,' namely, Sir Richard Fanshawe, as\r\nappears from an engraved monogram on the title-page.\r\n\r\n[274] As Fleay points out, the prologue and epilogue are not suited to\r\ncourt representation.\r\n\r\n[275] Randolph's familiarity with Guarini is evident throughout, and there\r\nis at least one distinct reminiscence, namely Thestylis' humorous\r\nexpansion of Corisca's remark about changing her lovers like her clothes:\r\n\r\n    Other Nymphs\r\n  Have their varietie of loves, for every gowne,\r\n  Nay, every petticote; I have only one,\r\n  The poore foole Mopsus! (I. ii.)\r\n\r\n[276] A word borrowed by Randolph from the Greek, ὀμφή, a divine voice or\r\nprophecy. He may possibly have associated the word with the Delphic\r\nὀμφαλός.\r\n\r\n[277] It is possible that Laurinda's indecision may owe something to the\r\n_doppio amore_ of Celia in the _Filli di Sciro_. See especially III. i. of\r\nthat play.\r\n\r\n[278] Homer Smith quotes as Halliwell's the description of the play as\r\n'one of the finest specimens of pastoral poetry in our language, partaking\r\nof the best properties of Guarini's and Tasso's poetry, without being a\r\nservile imitation of either.' He has been misled into supposing that the\r\ncomments in the _Dictionary of Plays_ are original. The above first\r\nappears in the _Biographia Dramatica_ of 1812, and may therefore be\r\nascribed to Stephen Jones. All Halliwell did was to omit the further\r\nwords, 'its style is at once simple and elevated, natural and dignified.'\r\nThe whole description is of course in the very worst style of critical\r\nclaptrap. Halliwell reprinted the 'fairy' scenes in his _Illustrations of\r\nthe Fairy Mythology of A Midsummer Night's Dream_ (Shakespeare Soc.,\r\n1845), though how they were supposed to illustrate anything of the kind we\r\nare not informed.\r\n\r\n[279] 1822, p. 61. This, the only modern edition of Randolph, is one of\r\nthe worst edited books in the language, and no literary drubbing was ever\r\nbetter deserved than that administered by the _Saturday Review_ on August\r\n21, 1875. As the text is quite useless for purposes of quotation, I have\r\nhad recourse to the very correct first edition of the _Poems_, 1638,\r\nchecked by a collation of the numerous subsequent issues.\r\n\r\n[280] The sense in the original is defective.\r\n\r\n[281] i.e. Tethys, a very common confusion.\r\n\r\n[282] The fact that the play was never published as a separate work makes\r\nit difficult to estimate its popularity with the reading public. The whole\r\ncollection was freqnently reprinted, 1638, 1640, 1643, 1652, 1664 and 1668\r\ntwice. In 1703 appeared the _Fickle Shepherdess_, 'As it is Acted in the\r\nNew Theatre in Lincolns-Inn Fields. By Her Majesties Servants. Play'd all\r\nby Women.' This piece is said in the epistle dedicatory to Lady Gower to\r\nbe 'abreviated from an Author famous in his Time.' It is in fact a prose\r\nrendering, much compressed, of the main action of Randolph's play, the\r\nlanguage being for the most part just sufficiently altered to turn good\r\nverse into bad prose.\r\n\r\n[283] Vide post, p. 382.\r\n\r\n[284] For a detailed discussion of the evidence I must refer the reader to\r\nthe Introduction to my reprint of the play in the _Materialien zur Kunde\r\ndes älteren Englischen Dramas_ (vol. xi, 1905). The following summary may\r\nbe quoted. '(i) There is no ground for supposing that there ever existed\r\nmore of the _Sad Shepherd_ than we at present possess. (ii) The theory of\r\nthe substantial identity of the _Sad Shepherd_ and the _May Lord_ must be\r\nrejected, there being no reason to suppose that the latter was dramatic at\r\nall. (iii) The two works may, however, have been to some extent connected\r\nin subject, and fragments of the one may survive embedded in the other.\r\n(iv) The _May Lord_ was most probably written in the autumn of 1613. (v)\r\nThe date of the _Sad Shepherd_ cannot be fixed with certainty; but there\r\nis no definite evidence to oppose to the first line of the prologue and\r\nthe allusion in Falkland's elegy [in _Jonsonus Virbius_], which agree in\r\nplacing it in the few years preceding Jonson's death.'\r\n\r\n[285] The play has no doubt been somewhat lost in the big collected\r\neditions of the author's works, and has also suffered from its fragmentary\r\nstate. Previous to my own reprint it had only once been issued as a\r\nseparate publication, namely, by F. G. Waldrou, whose edition, with\r\ncontinuation, appeared in 1783. One of the best passages, however (II.\r\nviii), was given in Lamb's _Specimens_. In quoting from the play I have\r\npreferred to follow the original of 1640, as in my own reprint, merely\r\ncorrecting certain obvions errors, rather than Gifford's edition, in which\r\nwholly unwarrantable liberties are taken with the text.\r\n\r\n[286] Waldron, in his continuation, matches her with Clarion.\r\n\r\n[287] It involves, moreover, the critical fallacy of supposing that poetry\r\nis a sort of richly embroidered garment wherewith to clothe the nakedness\r\nof the underlying substance. This may be so in certain cases in which the\r\npoet is made and not born, or in which he forces himself to work at an\r\nuncongenial theme. But in a genuine work of art the substance cannot so be\r\nseparated from the form without injury to both. The poetry in this case is\r\nnot an external adornment, but a necessary part of the structure, without\r\nwhich it would be something else than what it is. Verse, when in organic\r\nrelation with the subject, modifies the character of that subject itself,\r\nand the subject can only be rightly apprehended through the medium of the\r\nverse. I contend that the _Sad Shepherd_ is a case in point, and Mr.\r\nSwinburne's remarks, I conceive, bear out my view. I shall not, therefore,\r\nseek to analyse the types represented by the characters--styling poor\r\nlittle Amie a modification of the type of the 'forward shepherdess'!--nor\r\ncount the number of lines assigned respectively to the shepherds, to the\r\nhuntsmen, or to the witch; but shall endeavonr to ascertain the particular\r\nobject Jonson had in view in adopting a particular presentation of the\r\nsubject, the means he employed, and the measure of success he achieved.\r\n\r\n[288] The distinction which appears to belong peculiarly to the drama is\r\nmost likely a survival of the influence of the mythological plays, in\r\nwhich the huntress nymphs of Diana frequently appear. We find, however, a\r\ntendency to a similar dualism in Mantuan's upland and lowland swains.\r\n\r\n[289] It has recently been argued with much ingenuity that Marian is\r\noriginally none other than the familiar figure of French _pastourelles_.\r\nHowever this may be, it is a question with which I am not here concerned.\r\nIt was the English Robin Hood tradition that formed part of Jonson's rough\r\nmaterial. See E. K. Chambers, _The Mediaeval Stage_, i. p. 175.\r\n\r\n[290] The author, however, is at fault in his terms of art. If the quarry\r\nto which he likens Aeglamour had a dappled hide, it was a fallow and not a\r\nred deer. In this case it should have been called a buck, and not a hart.\r\nAgain, the female should have been a doe: deer is a generic name including\r\nboth sexes of red, fallow, and roe alike.\r\n\r\n[291] A translation of the _Astrée_ appeared as early as 1620, but the\r\nFrench fashion obtained no hold over the popular taste till the later days\r\nof the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n[292] I may say that this section was written as it stands before K.\r\nBrunhuber's essay on _Sidneys Arcadia und ihre Nachlaufer_ came into my\r\nhands. He gives a superficial account of several printed plays, but was\r\nunaware of the existence of those in MS.\r\n\r\n[293] The quotations are from the Gifford-Dyce edition of Shirley's Works\r\n(1833), the only collected edition that has appeared. The text stands\r\nbadly in need of revision, but I have had to content myself with a few\r\nobvious corrections. For instance, in the passage quoted above, the\r\neditors have followed the quarto in reducing l. 13 to nonsense, by reading\r\n'no man,' and l. 20 by reading 'And the imagination.'\r\n\r\n[294] So at least in the printed play. In the original draft, and probably\r\nalso in the acting version, as Fleay has pointed out, they were king and\r\nqueen, and of this traces remain. Thus we twice find Gynetia addressed as\r\n'Queen,' while elsewhere 'Duke' rimes with 'spring,' and 'Duchess' with\r\n'spleen.' The alteration was no doubt made from motives of prudence. Even\r\nso the play was, according to Fleay, published surreptitiously, i.e. it\r\ndoes not appear on the Stationers' Register.\r\n\r\n[295] A. H. Bullen's reprint of Day's works was privately printed in 1881.\r\nThough the text is not in all respects satisfactory, I have thought myself\r\njustified in quoting from it as the only edition available.\r\n\r\n[296] Not tennis, as Mr. Bullen states (Introd. p. 17), oblivious for the\r\nmoment of the impossibility of representing a tennis match on the stage,\r\nas well as of the fact that the game was never, in Elizabethan times,\r\nplayed by ladies.\r\n\r\n[297] There is one printed play, the relation of which to the _Arcadia_ is\r\nnot very clear. The title, _Mucedorus_, at once suggests some connexion,\r\nbut it is difficult to follow it out in detail. Mucedorus, 'the king's\r\nsonne of Valentia,' leaves his father's court and goes disguised as a\r\nshepherd to win the love of Amadine, 'the king's daughter of Arragon.' He\r\ntwice rescues the princess, is sentenced to banishment, and reveals his\r\nidentity just as his father arrives in search of him. The play was\r\noriginally printed in 1598, but no doubt originated some years earlier,\r\n_c._ 1588 according to Fleay. Most of the resemblances with the _Arcadia_,\r\nhowever, are due to scenes which first appeared in 1610, in which edition\r\nthe king of Valentia first plays a part. Beyond Mucedorus' disguise there\r\nis absolutely nothing pastoral in the play. With the exception of some of\r\nthe additional scenes, which are undoubtedly by a different hand from the\r\nrest, the play is unrelieved rubbish. Probably the original author\r\nutilized in the composition of his piece such elements and incidents of\r\nthe _Arcadia_ as he had gathered orally while the unfinished work still\r\ncirculated in MS. Later the reviser, being aware of this source, expanded\r\nthe play from a knowledge of the completed work. It cannot be said to be a\r\ndramatization of the romance, though it is undoubtedly in a manner founded\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\n[298] Egerton MS. 1994. Not _Love's Changelings Changed_, as usually\r\nquoted.\r\n\r\n[299] _Old Plays_, ii. p. 432.\r\n\r\n[300] Rawl. Poet, 3.\r\n\r\n[301] In the Bodleian MS. Ashmole 788 is a Latin epistle by Philip Kynder,\r\na miscellaneous writer and court agent under Charles I, born in 1600 at\r\nlatest, which was 'prefixt before my _Silvia_, a Latin comedie or\r\npastorall, translated from the _Archadia_, written at eighteen years of\r\nage.' (See Halliwell's _Dic. of Plays_.) The 'Archadia' might, of course,\r\nrefer either to Sannazzaro's or Lope de Vega's romances, though this is\r\nhighly improbable.\r\n\r\n[302] So much we learn from the title-page itself. The play had very\r\nlikely been acted at court some years earlier, but the document mentioning\r\nsuch a performance, printed by Cunningham, is of doubtful authenticity,\r\nwhile Fleay contradicts himself upon the subject. The question is,\r\nhappily, immaterial to our present purpose.\r\n\r\n[303] Here, as in the _Isle of Gulls_, the titles of Duke and Duchess have\r\nbeen imperfectly substituted for King and Queen, probably for court\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n[304] The story in the romance is very different. Erona, after many\r\nadventures, marries her lover. Both episodes are related in Book II,\r\nchapters xiii and following (ed. 1590). They are epitomized by Dyce, whose\r\nedition I have of course used.\r\n\r\n[305] Here, again, the catastrophe of the play bears no resemblance to the\r\nromance.\r\n\r\n[306] See III. v. According to Chetwood (_British Theatre_, 1752, p. 47),\r\nthe play was revived in 1671, with a prologue attributing it to Shirley.\r\nThis is, of course, possible, but it requires more than Chetwood's\r\nunsupported authority to render it probable. Fleay suggests that the\r\nauthor is the same as the J. S. of _Phillis of Scyros_, namely, as I have\r\nshown, Jonathan Sidnam. This seems to me highly improbable. The play is\r\nprinted in Hazlitt's Dodsley, vol. xiv, whence I quote, with necessary\r\ncorrections.\r\n\r\n[307] Bk. I. chaps. v-viii, Bk. III. chap. xii, in the edition of 1590.\r\n\r\n[308] Quotations are taken, with corrections, from Pearson's reprint of\r\nGlapthorne's works (1874).\r\n\r\n[309] K. Deighton's emendation, undoubtedly correct, for 'Love' of the\r\noriginal. (_Conjectural Readings_, second series, Calcutta, 1898, p. 136.)\r\n\r\n[310] I have been unable to trace this work beyond a reference to Heber's\r\nsale given in Hazlitt's _Handbook_. The original story will be found in\r\n_Albion's England_, Book IV, chap. xx, of the first Part, published in\r\n1586. As Dr. Ward points out, it is a variant of the old romance of\r\nHavelok. Edel, with a view to disinheriting his niece Argentile, heir to\r\nDiria (?Deira), of which he is regent, seeks to marry her to a base\r\nscullion. This menial, however, is really Curan, prince of Danske, who has\r\nsought the court in disguise, in the hope of obtaining the love of the\r\nprincess, who is mewed up from intercourse with the world. Of this\r\nArgentile is ignorant, and when she hears of her uncle's purpose, she\r\ncontrives to escape from court and lives disguised as a shepherdess. After\r\nher flight Curan also leaves the court and assumes a shepherd's garb, and\r\nmeeting Argentile by chance again falls in love with her without knowing\r\nwho she is. After a while he reveals his identity, and she hers; they are\r\nmarried, and he conquers back her kingdom from the usurping Edel.\r\n\r\n[311] So far as I am aware, A. B. Grosart was the first to point this out.\r\n(_Spenser_, iii. p. lxx.)\r\n\r\n[312] It is printed in Hazlitt's _Webster_, vol. iv. Fleay, with\r\ncharacteristic assurance, identifies the _Thracian Wonder_ with a lost\r\nplay of Heywood's, known only from Henslowe's Diary, and there called 'War\r\nwithout blows and love without suit.' He argues: 'in i. 2, \"You never\r\nshall again renew your suit;\" but the love is given at the end without any\r\nsuit; and in iii. 2, \"Here was a happy war finished without blows.\"' The\r\nidentification, however, will not bear examination. No battle, it is true,\r\nis fought at Sicily's first appearance, but the title, _War without Blows_\r\ncould hardly be applied to a play in which the whole of the last act is\r\noccupied with fierce fighting between three different nations. So with the\r\nsecond title, _Love without Suit_. Serena indeed grants her love in the\r\nend without any reason whatever, but only after her lover has 'suited'\r\nhimself clean out of his five wits. Moreover, it is not certain that this\r\nsecond title should not be _Love without Strife_. Heywood's play, I have\r\nlittle doubt, was a mere love-comedy (cf. such titles as _The Amorous\r\nWar_, and similar expressions in the dramatists _passim_). The\r\nidentification, moreover, would necessitate the date 1598, though this\r\ndoes not prevent Fleay from stating that the piece is founded on William\r\nWebster's poem published in 1617. So early a date seems to me rather\r\nimprobable. Since William Webster's poem has nothing to do with the\r\npresent piece, the suggestion that Kirkman's attribution of the play to\r\nJohn Webster was due to a confusion of course falls to the ground.\r\n\r\n[313] According to S. L. Lee in the _Dic. Nat. Biog._, who follows the\r\n_Biographia Dramatica._\r\n\r\n[314] It will be found in Mr. Bullen's admirable collection, _Lyrics from\r\nthe Dramatists_, 1889, p. 231.\r\n\r\n[315] Reprinted in 1882 by A. H. Bullen in the first volume of his _Old\r\nEnglish Plays_, and more recently by R. W. Bond in his edition of Lyly. In\r\nquoting, I have generally followed the latter, though I have preferred my\r\nown arrangement of certain passages. None of the suggestions that have\r\nbeen put forward as to the authorship of the play appear to me to carry\r\nmuch weight. The ascription of the whole to Lyly, first made by Archer in\r\n1656, and repeated by Halliwell as late as 1860, is now utterly\r\ndiscredited. The view, first advanced by Edmund Gosse, that the author was\r\nJohn Day, has been tentatively endorsed by both editors of the piece; but\r\nI agree with Professer Gollancz in thinking it unlikely on the ground of\r\nstyle. Fleay assigns the serious (verse) portion of the play to Daniel,\r\nand the comic (prose) scenes to Lyly. It seems to me unlikely, however,\r\nthat Daniel, who was shortly to appear as the chief exponent of the\r\northodox Italian tradition, should at this date have been concerned in the\r\nproduction of a typical example of the hybrid pastoral of the English\r\nstage. Nor do I believe that Lyly was in any way concerned in the piece,\r\nthough some scenes are evident imitations of his work. This, however,\r\ninvolves the question of the authorship of the lyrics found in Lyly's\r\nplays, and I must refer for a detailed discussion to my article upon the\r\nsubject already cited (p. 227).\r\n\r\n[316] _Metamorphoses_, ix. 667, &c. Ward is moved to characterize the plot\r\nas a theme of 'Ovidian lubricity.' I question whether any such censure is\r\nmerited. That the theme is one which would have become intolerably\r\nsuggestive in the hands of the Sienese Intronati, for instance, may be\r\nadmitted, but the author has treated the story with complete _naïveté_.\r\nThe obscene passages referred to later on (p. 345) occur in the comic\r\naction, and are in no way connected with the point in question. Ward\r\nfurther informs us that the play is 'throughout in rime,' notwithstanding\r\nthe fact that something approaching a quarter of the whole is in prose.\r\n\r\n[317] I must repeat that I see no advantage to be gained from the method\r\nadopted by Homer Smith, who tries to extract and separate the strictly\r\npastoral elements from the medley. A play is not a child's puzzle that can\r\nbe taken to pieces and labelled, nor even a chemical compound to be\r\nanalysed into its component parts. What is of interest is to note the\r\nvarious influences which have affected and modified the growth of the\r\nliterary organism.\r\n\r\n[318] Though the author may very likely have known Spenser's description\r\nof the house of Morpheus _(Faery Queen_, I. i. 348, &c.), he certainly\r\ndrew his own account straight from Ovid (_Metam._ xi. 592, &c.), to which,\r\nof course, Spenser was also indebted. I am rather inclined to think the\r\nauthor drew his material from Golding's translation (xi. 687, &c.). With\r\nthe second passage quoted, cf. _Faery Queen_, II. xii. 636, &c.\r\n\r\n[319] 'Trip and go' was a proverbial expression, and is found, with its\r\nobvious rime 'to and fro,' in several old dance-songs.\r\n\r\n[320] The only composition I can recall which at all anticipates the\r\npeculiar effect of this lyric is Thestylis' song in the _Arraignment of\r\nParis_ (III. ii.), to which, in the old edition, is appended the quaint\r\nnote, 'The grace of this song is in the Shepherds' echo to her verse.'\r\n\r\n[321] Fleay gives the date 1601, following Halliwell, but Haslewood has\r\n1603.\r\n\r\n[322] According to Fleay, it 'was intended to be presented to James I on\r\n13th Mar. 1614.' This date must be a slip, since it was not till 1615 that\r\nthe king was at Cambridge. It is, moreover, correctly given in his\r\n_History of the Stage_. The preparations also appear to have been for the\r\neleventh, not the thirteenth. Fleay further mentions a performance at\r\nKing's before Charles I, but gives no authority.\r\n\r\n[323] An exception must be made of Ward, whose remarks are almost\r\nexcessively laudatory, though his treatment of the piece is necessarily\r\nslight.\r\n\r\n[324] The incidents occur, however, in Book II of Browne's work (Songs 4\r\nand 5), which was not printed till 1616. Either, therefore, Fletcher had\r\nseen Browne's poem in manuscript, or else the play, as originally\r\nperformed, differed from the printed version. I think it unlikely that the\r\nborrowing should have been the other way.\r\n\r\n[325] Fleay confuses the two performances, and, by placing Goffe's death\r\nin 1627, is forced to suppose that the 'praeludium' was added by another\r\nhand. It may be noticed that, if this introduction is by Goffe, Salisbury\r\nCourt was probably opened in the spring, a point otherwise unsettled.\r\n\r\n[326] The resemblance with the _Sad Shepherd_, I. i, is almost too close\r\nto be fortuitous. It is, on the other hand, not easily accounted for. The\r\nwhole passage quoted above is somewhat markedly superior to the general\r\nlevel of the verse in the play, not merely the two or three lines in which\r\na distinct resemblance to Jonson can be traced. Is it possible that both\r\nGoffe and Jonson were following, the one slavishly, the other with more\r\nimagination, one common original, now unknown? Or can it be that Goffe is\r\nhere reproducing a passage from an early unpublished work of Jonson's own,\r\na passage which Jonson later refashioned into the singularly perfect\r\nspeech of Aeglamour?\r\n\r\n[327] Homer Smith, in making these assertions, overlooks historical\r\nevidence. It is, however, only fair to Goffe to say that other critics\r\napparently take a very much more favourable view of the merits of the\r\npiece than I am able to do.\r\n\r\n[328] Hardly in those of the prologue to _Hymen's Triumph_, as suggested\r\nby Homer Smith.\r\n\r\n[329] W. C. Hazlitt (_Manual of Plays_, p. 25) records: 'Bellessa, the\r\nShepherd's Queen: The scene, Galicia. An unpublished and incomplete drama\r\nin prose and verse. Fol.' In the absence of further evidence I conclude\r\nthat this is an imperfect MS. of Montagu's piece.\r\n\r\n[330] The designs for the scene, by Inigo Jones, are preserved in the\r\nBritish Museum, MS. Lansd. 1,171, fols. 15-16. Fols. 5-6 of the same MS.\r\ncontain the ground-plans 'for a pasterall in the hall at whitthall w'ch\r\nwas ackted by the ffrench on St Thomas day the 23th of decemb'r 1635,'\r\nwhich may refer to the same piece.\r\n\r\n[331] It may, however, be founded on some French romance.\r\n\r\n[332] The play will be found in Hazlitt's 'Dodsley,' vol. xii, whence I\r\nquote. Hazlitt suggests that 'the episode of Sylvia and Thyrsis' may have\r\nhad its foundation in certain intrigues traceable in Digby's memoirs, and\r\nFleay would see in the characters of Stella and Mirtillus a hint of\r\nDorset's _liaison_ with Lady Venetia. I suppose that it has been thought\r\nnecessary to find allusions to actual persons, chiefly because the author\r\nexplicitly denies their existence. Homer Smith describes the play as a\r\npure Arcadian drama. 'The court element,' he writes, 'is so completely\r\novershadowed by the pastoral' as to justify the classification, in spite,\r\napparently, of the fact that the heroine never appears on the stage in\r\npastoral guise at all, and that in the greater part of the last three acts\r\nthe scene is laid at court.\r\n\r\n[333] See above, p. 246, for Fanshawe's version of the passage in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n[334] Were it not for these points of similarity, I should have supposed\r\nGosse to have been misled by the pastoral-sounding title of Randolph's\r\nPlautine comedy into confusing it with the _Amyntas_. The criticism is\r\nfrom an article in the _Cornhill_ for December, 1876. Homer Smith cites\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[335] The surname rests on Kirkman's authority, the addition of the\r\nChristian name is apparently due to Chetwood, and is therefore to be\r\naccepted with caution. I have been unable to trace any one of the name.\r\n\r\n[336] II. ii, sig. C 1^v of the old edition.\r\n\r\n[337] Halliwell, _Description of MSS. in the Public Library, Plymouth, to\r\nwhich are added Some Fragments of Early Literature hitherto unpublished_.\r\nMS. CII is a copy of the original manuscript in the possession of Sir E.\r\nDering. A manuscript of the play was in Quaritch's Catalogue for November,\r\n1899; I have been unable to trace it.\r\n\r\n[338] I may take the opportanity of mentioning in a note one or two Latin\r\nplays. In Emmanuel College (to the courtesy of whose librarian, Mr. E. S.\r\nShuckburgh, I am much indebted) is preserved the manuscript of a play\r\nentitled _Parthenia_, which was no doubt acted at Cambridge, but\r\nconcerning which no record apparently survives. The introduction of 'Pan\r\nArcadiae deus' and of a character 'Cacius Latro' show that the piece was\r\ninfluenced both by the mythological drama and the romance of adventure.\r\nThe most interesting point about the play is that the chief male\r\ncharacters bear the names of Philissides and Amyntas, which will be\r\nrecognized as the pastoral titles of Sidney and Watson respectively.\r\nSince, however, the handwriting appears to be after 1600, and there is no\r\ncorrespondeuce in the female parts, it is more than doubtful whether any\r\nallusion was intended. Another Cambridge piece is the _Silvanus_, a MS. of\r\nwhich is in the Bodleian (Douce 234). It was performed on January 13,\r\n1596, and may possibly have been written by one Anthony Rollinson--the\r\nname is erased.\r\n\r\n[339] Bullen's _Peele_, i.p. 363.\r\n\r\n[340] The only recorded copy of the original is in the British Museum, but\r\nis imperfect, having the title-page in facsimile from some other copy at\r\npresent unknown. A reprint from another copy, possibly of a different\r\nedition, is found in Nichols' _Progresses of Elisabeth_, from which a\r\nmodernized reprint was prepared by the Lee Priory Press in 1815. Finally,\r\nit appears in Mr. Bond's edition of Lyly, i. p. 471, whence I quote.\r\n\r\n[341] See the excellent edition by W. Bang, _Materialien zur Kunde des\r\nalteren englischen Dramas_, vol. iii, 1903.\r\n\r\n[342] All necessary apparatns for the study of this literary curiosity\r\nwill be fonnd in Miss M. L. Lee's edition, 1893. The original is a MS. in\r\nthe Bodleian.\r\n\r\n[343] See A. H. Thorndike, _Influence of Beaumont and Fletcher on\r\nShakspeare_, 1901, p. 32. In _Mucedorus_ (I. i. 51) we find mention of a\r\nshepherd's disguise used 'in Lord Julio's masque.' The passage occurs in\r\nthe additional scenes of 1610, and there are numerous masques of the\r\nperiod that might claim to be that referred to. Fleay conjectures '_The\r\nShepherds' Mask_ of James I.'s time,' and elsewhere identifies this title,\r\nwhich he gets from Halliwell's _Dictionary_, with Jonson's masque, _Pan's\r\nAnniversary, or the Shepherds' Holiday_. This, however, was produced at\r\nearliest in 1623, and can hardly therefore have been alluded to in 1610.\r\nHalliwell took his title from the British Museum MS. Addit. 10,444, in\r\nwhich appears the music for a number of 'masques,' or dances taken from\r\nmasques, and in which this particular _Shepherds' Masque_ (fol. 34^{v}) is\r\ndated 1635.\r\n\r\n[344] The date here assigned presents obvions difficultes. It would\r\nnaturally mean that it was performed after March 24, 1625; but as James\r\ndied after about a fortnight's serious illness on March 27, this can\r\nhardly be accepted. Nichols placed the performance conjecturally in\r\nAugust, 1624, for reasons which I am inclined to regard as satisfactory.\r\nFleay pronounces in favour of June 19, 1623, with a confidence not\r\naltogether calculated to inspire the like feeling in others.\r\n\r\n[345] _Lives_, Oxford, 1898, i. p. 251.\r\n\r\n[346] 'The Dramatic Works of John Tatham,' 1879. In Maidment and Logan's\r\n_Dramatists of the Restoration_.\r\n\r\n[347] Another parallel may be found in Shirley's _Maid's Revenge_, IV. iv,\r\nwhere the wounded Antonio exclaims:\r\n\r\n  Where art, Berinthia? let me breathe my last\r\n  Upon thy lip; make haste, lest I die else.\r\n\r\nThe situation, however, is different. Shirley's play was licensed in 1626.\r\n\r\n[348] In a small quarto volume, classed as Addit. MS. 14,047. The piece\r\nhas hitherto been ascribed to George Wilde, on the authority of Halliwell.\r\nThere appears to be no reason for this ascription, beyond the fact that\r\nthe same volume also contains two pieces by Wilde. His name, however, does\r\nnot occur in connexion with the present play, and the volume, which is in\r\na variety of hands, certainly includes work not by him. Wilde was scholar\r\nand fellow of St. John's, chaplain to Laud, and Bishop of Londonderry\r\nafter the restoration. His plays consist of the two comedies in this\r\nvolume, viz. the Latin _Euphormus, sive Cupido Adultus_, acted on Feb. 5,\r\n1634/5, and the _Hospital of Lovers_, acted before the king and queen on\r\nAug. 29, 1636, both at St. John's. He is also said to have written another\r\nLatin play, called _Hermophus_, though nothing is known of it beyond the\r\nrecord of its being acted. It was most probably the same as _Euphormus_,\r\nthe titles being anagrams of each other.\r\n\r\n[349] The _Dic. Nat. Biog_. gives the date as 1635.\r\n\r\n[350] The stage directions for these entries are interesting: (l) 'Enter\r\nAn Antique [i.e. antimasque] of Sheapheards'; (2) 'enter the Masque'; (3)\r\n'the masque enters and dances, and after wardes exit.' The terms 'masque'\r\nand 'antimasque' appear to have been used technically for the dances of\r\nthe masque proper, and of its burlesque counterpart. In this sense the\r\nwords occur repeatedly in the British Museum Addit. MS. 10,444, which\r\ncontains the music only. In the present case the masquers appear to have\r\nbeen distinct from the characters of the play.\r\n\r\n[351] R. Brotanek, _Die englischen Maskenspiele_, 1902, p. 201. See also\r\nthe edition by R. Brotanek and W. Bang, _Materialien zur Kunde des älteren\r\nEnglischen Dramas,_ vol. ii, 1903; and further in the _Modern Language\r\nQuarterly_ for April, 1904, vii. p. 17.\r\n\r\n[352] The first issue was printed 'for the use of the Author,' without\r\ndate, but was received by Thomason on Sept. 1, 1656, which would appear to\r\ndispose of the fiction that Cox died in 1648.\r\n\r\n[353] This letter was prefixed to the masque in the collected edition of\r\nthe Poems (1645), but was written to the author without view to\r\npublication.\r\n\r\n[354] Fifty-eight lines in decasyllabic couplets--not eighty-three lines\r\nof blank verse, as for some inexplicable reason Masson asserts (i. p.\r\n150).\r\n\r\n[355] Specific references will be found scattered through Masson's notes.\r\nTo supplement his work I may refer to some interesting remarks on _Comus_\r\nas a masque, and a useful comparison with Peele's play, by M. W. Samson, of\r\nIndiana University, in the introduction to his edition of Milton's Minor\r\nPoems, New York, 1901. Here, as elsewhere in the case of Milton's Works, I\r\nfollow H. C. Beeching's admirable text, Oxford, 1900.\r\n\r\n[356] Not wishing to pursue this point further, I may be allowed to refer\r\nto certain candid and judicious remaries in Saintsbury's _Elizabethan\r\nLiterature_, p. 387.\r\n\r\n[357] I am perfectly aware of, and in writing the above have made every\r\nallowance for, three considerations which may be urged in explanation of\r\nthe passages in question. In the first place, it must be remembered that\r\nthe age was an outspoken one, and used to giving free expression to\r\nthoughts and feelings which we are in the habit of passing over in\r\nsilence. Secondly, the age was unquestionably one of considerable licence,\r\nwhich must be held to have warranted somewhat direct speaking on the part\r\nof those who held to a stricter code of morals; and, moreover, it must be\r\nconceded that the Puritan failing of self-righteous protestation was as a\r\nrule combined with very genuine practice of the professed virtues.\r\nThirdly, there is the fact that the age of thirteen was at that time, by\r\ncommon consent, regarded as already mature womanhood. On one and all of\r\nthese heads a good deal might be written, but it would only extend yet\r\nfurther a discussion which has already, it may be, exceeded reasonable\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\n[358] I ought, perhaps, to apologize for thus alluding to these poems as\r\nsubsequent to _Comus_, seeing that criticism usually places them some\r\nyears earlier. There is, however, no external evidence of any kind, and to\r\nme the internal evidence of style points strongly to a later date.\r\nPossibly, since they are not fonnd in the Trinity MS., they were composed\r\nduring Milton's travels, which would place them after _Lycidas_ even,\r\nsomewhere about 1638 or 1639. One of the ablest of our living critics,\r\nhimself a close and original student of Milton, writes in a private\r\nletter: 'I long ago heard a good critic say that _Comus_ seemed to him\r\nprentice work beside _L'Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_; and these do seem to\r\nme, I must confess, the maturer poems.' The point was raised by F. Byse in\r\nthe _Modern Language Quarterly_ for July, 1900, iii. p. 16.\r\n\r\n[359] Conversations, IV and III, Shakespeare Society, 1842, pp. 4 and 2.\r\n\r\n[360] Those who wish to pursue the subject further will find the necessary\r\nreferences in Sommer's _Erster Versuch über die Englische Hirtendichtung_,\r\nand a full discussion in an elaborate 'Inquiry into the propriety of the\r\nrules prescribed for Pastoral Poetry,' prefixed to the edition of Ramsay's\r\n_Gentle Shepherd_, published at Edinburgh in 1808. Some judicious remarks\r\nwill also be found in the Introduction to Chambers' _English Pastorals_,\r\npp. xliv, &c.\r\n\r\n[361] This limitation, it may be observed, does not necessarily apply to\r\nall literary forms. It may, I think, reasonably be maintained that the\r\nform of the drama, for instance, is essentially conditioned by the\r\npsychological relation of author to audience, through the medium of actual\r\nrepresentation, and that this relation is equivalent to, or at least\r\ncapable of forming the basis of, a theory of drama. I am aware that such\r\nan abstract view as this finds little favour with the majority of modern\r\ncritics, but while myself doubtful as to its practical value, I do not see\r\nthat it involves any critical absurdity.\r\n\r\n[362] This impulse can certainly be traced in some of the eclogues, and\r\nstill more markedly in the purely lyrical verse of a pastoral sort. But\r\nthe cross influences are too complex to be recapitulated here.\r\n\r\n[363] The influence of the Latin eclogue of the renaissance was\r\nundoubtedly also direct, but though widespread it was hardly vital, and\r\nits importance, as compared with that of the vernacular tradition, may be\r\nnot inadequately measured by the relative importance of the chief\r\nexponents of either, Googe and Spenser.\r\n\r\n[364] Especially the allusions to religions controversy. The romance was,\r\nof course, highly topical in Spain, but, waiving the rather debatable\r\npoint of Sidney's allusive intentions, it never appears to have been\r\ngenerally so regarded in this country.\r\n\r\n[365] Possibly I ought to add a fourth, the masques at court; but their\r\ninfluence in large measure duplicated that of the Italian drama, and\r\ncannot be distinguished from it.\r\n\r\n[366] See Rossi, p. 175, note 1.\r\n\r\n[367] Ferrara, Caraffo, 1588, p. 50.

Many, indeed, are only to be found in\r\nout-of-the-way provincial libraries in Italy, and have, I believe, never\r\nbeen examined by any one but Carducci himself. The references in my notes\r\nequally testify my indebtedness to Rossi's monograph; indeed, my whole\r\ntreatment of the subject is based on his work.\r\n\r\n[372] I shall endeavour to note the various verse-forms employed, as the\r\nevidence is often of use in determining the question of development. It\r\nmay, however, be very easily misleading if unduly pressed, as by Carducci.\r\nIn general, the _terza rima_ may be taken as pointing to the influence of\r\nSannazzaro's _Arcadia; ottava rima_, courtly or rustic, to that of\r\nPoliziano's _Orfeo_ and _Giostra_ and Lorenzo de' Medici's _Nencia_\r\nrespectively; the _endecasillabi sciolti_, or blank verse, to that of the\r\nregular drama. Of the free measures, _endecasillabi e settinarî_, of the\r\nlater plays I shall have to speak more in detail hereafter.\r\n\r\n[373] Edited from MS. by Felice Bariola, with other poems of Taccone's,\r\nFirenze, 1884, p. 14. Rossi, 166^{2}; Carducci, 28^{1}.\r\n\r\n[374] Printed in the 'Opere dello elegante poeta Seraphino Aquilano,'\r\nVenetia, Bindoni, 1516, sig. D5. Rossi, 167^{1}. For the date, Carducci,\r\n29^{2}.\r\n\r\n[375] Of these authors little or nothing appears to be known. Both pieces\r\nhave come down to us in MS.; see Adolfo Bartoli, _Mss. italiani della\r\nNazionale di Firenze_, Firenze, 1884, ii. pp. 138 and 163. Concerning the\r\nfirst, see further, _Poesie inedite di G. Del Carretto_, by A. G. Spinelli,\r\nSavona, pp. 10-15; concerning the second, R. Renier, in the _Giornale\r\nstorico della letteratura italiana_, 1885, v. p. 236, note 1. Rossi,\r\n167^{2},^{3}; Carducci, 30^{2}, 28^{3}.\r\n\r\n[376] _Opere_, 1516, as cited, sig. E.

Croce, 'Napoli dal 1508 al 1512 (da un antico romanzo\r\nspagnuolo),' in _Archivio storico per le provincie napolitane_, anno xix,\r\nfasc. i, pp. 141 and 157. Carducci, 29^{1}.\r\n\r\n[380] _Opera nova_, Venetia, Rusconi, 1508. In the old edition the pieces\r\nare merely termed 'commedie,' the designation 'pastorali' being due to the\r\n'Arcadian,' G. M. Crescimbeni, whose _Istoria delia volgar poesia_\r\noriginally appeared in 1698. Carducci, 41^{1}.\r\n\r\n[381] See Carducci, p. 35. Stiefel, being only aware of the edition of\r\n1543, hoped to find in the piece a link between Casalio and Beccari. Among\r\nseveral female characters introduced is one 'la quale volentieri starebbe\r\nin mezzo di due amanti o mariti: il che,' pursues Carducci, 'è del tutto\r\nopposto all' idealità delia favola pastorale.' One would have thought that\r\ncertain traits in the characters of Dafne and Corisca would have occurred\r\nto him. Bitter satire on women was indeed one of the most permanent\r\nfeatures of pastoral comedy, as it had been of the Latin eclogue.\r\n\r\n[382] See D'Ancona, 'II teatro mantovano nel secolo _XVI_,' in the\r\n_Giornale storico_, v. p. 19. Rossi, 170^{1}.\r\n\r\n[383] See G. Campori, _Notizie sulla vita di L. Ariosto_, Modena, 1871, p.\r\n68. Rossi, 172^{1}. No mention of these is made by Carducci, his thesis\r\nbeing that the _ecloga rappresentativa_ did not obtain at Ferrara, the\r\nhome _par excellence_ of the Arcadian drama. Thus, on p. 54 he writes:\r\n'Delie parecchie ecloghe pastorali e rusticali passate in rassegna fin qui\r\nnon una ce n' è o scritta o rappresentata o stampata in Ferrara, non una\r\nd'origine ferrarese. In Ferrara entriamo classicamente e signorilmente con\r\nl'_Egle_ [1545].'\r\n\r\n[384] Rossi, 173^{1}. Carducci, 37.\r\n\r\n[385] See L. Frati, 'Un' ecloga msticale del 1508,' in the _Giornale\r\nstorico_, xx(1892), p. 186. Carducci, 27^{2}.\r\n\r\n[386] See O. Guerrini, _Narrazione di Paolo Palliolo_, Bologna, Romagnoli,\r\n1885, p. 96. Carducci, 31^{1}.\r\n\r\n[387] See C. Mazzi, _La congrega dei Rozzi di Siena_, i. p. 139 and ii. p.\r\n100. Carducci, 31^{2}. Also Rossi, 174^{3}; his suggestion of the possible\r\nidentity of the two last-mentioned pieces has been shown by later research\r\nto be inadmissible.\r\n\r\n[388] A battle was fought at Tai, near Pieve di Cadore.\r\n\r\n[389] The number of such pieces is very large. A list appended to the\r\n_Assetta_ in 1756 runs to 109 items. An exhaustive bibliography will be\r\nfound in Mazzi's work. See also the useful collection by Giulio Ferrario,\r\nforming vol. x of the 'Teatro antico' in the 'Classici italiani,' Milan,\r\n1812. It is unfortunate that Symonds should have referred to Ferrario's\r\nlist as evidence of the fertility of the pastoral drama, even though\r\nadding that the list is 'devoted solely to rural scenes of actual life,'\r\nsince he can hardly escape the charge of regarding the rustic compositions\r\nas part of the pastoral drama proper--a position to which they certainly\r\nhave no claim.\r\n\r\n[390] Not, of course, to be confused with the _sacra rappresentazione_ so\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\n[391] See F. Flamini's edition of Tansillo's poems, Napoli, 1893. Rossi,\r\n171^{1}; Carducci, 39^{2}.\r\n\r\n[392] Used, for example, by Sannazzaro, in his _Farsa_. See his 'Opere\r\nvolgari,' Padova, 1723, p. 422.\r\n\r\n[393] See E. Pèrcopo, 'M. Ant. Epicuro,' in the _Giornale storico_, 1888,\r\nxii. p. 1. Carducci, 39^{1}. The earliest edition with the later title I\r\nhave met with is one dated 1533, in my possession. The British Museum has\r\nnone earlier than 1535.\r\n\r\n[394] Siena, Mazochi, 1530. Carducci, 44^{3}.\r\n\r\n[395] It continued to be occasionally reprinted till as late as 1612.\r\nCarducci, 44.\r\n\r\n[396] Venezia, Zoppino, 1538. Carducci, 43^{1}.\r\n\r\n[397] It may have been a direct borrowing, for we know that Tasso was\r\nacquainted with the plays of Epicuro, whom he imitated in his _Rinaldo_\r\n(V. 25, &c.). The _Mirzia_ is printed in 'I drammi pastorali di A. Marsi,'\r\ned. I. Palmerini, Bologna, 1887-8. See also Pèrcopo in the _Giornale_, as\r\ncited. Carducci, 62. The authorship is a little doubtful. Creizenach, ii.\r\n365^{1}.\r\n\r\n[398] Firenze, 1545. Carducci, 46^{1}.\r\n\r\n[399] _Rime_, Venezia, Giolito, 1546. Carducci, 51^{1}.\r\n\r\n[400] Vinegia, Bertacagno, 1553. Carducci, 53^{1}.\r\n\r\n[401] _Egle_, s.l. et a. Rossi, 176^{1}; Carducci, 54.\r\n\r\n[402] This strong feeling concerning the incestuous nature of connexion\r\nbetween cousins, however strange to us, appears to have been very real in\r\nItaly in the sixteenth century. _Sorella germana_, a common term for a\r\nfemale cousin, is in itself sufficient evidence of the feeling. Readers of\r\nthe _novelle_ will remember the discussion on the subject by Pietro\r\nFortini in his _Novelle de' Novizi_, xxxi. The explanation of the\r\nphenomenon is no doubt to be sought in the peculiar conventions of Italian\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n[403] Speaking of the _Favola_, Carducci says: 'lo stile è quel nobile del\r\nGiraldi.' This is a point on which the opinion of a foreigner can never\r\ncarry very much weight; but with all deference to Signer Carducci's\r\njudgement, I cannot help expressing my opinion that the verse is\r\ncharacterized by awkward verbal repetitions and a certain stiffness of\r\nexpression, which impart to it a quality of heaviness similar to that\r\nfound in the prose of the _Ecatommiti_. It seems to be the result of a\r\nconscious endeavour on the part of the Ferrarese to write pure Tuscan, and\r\nthe reader is constantly reminded of the memorable words in the preface to\r\nthe _Cortegiano_, in which Castiglione announces his intention 'di farmi\r\npiù tosto conoscere per Lombardo, parlando Lombardo, che per non Toscano,\r\nparlando troppo Toscano.'\r\n\r\n[404] Ferrara, De Rossi, 1555. Rossi, 176^{1}; Carducci, 57. The piece\r\nmust not, of course, be confused either with the _Sacrifizio pastorale_,\r\nparaphrased by Firenzuola from the _Arcadia_, or with the masque called\r\n_El Sacrifizio_, performed by the Intronati at Siena in 1531, and printed\r\nin 1537.\r\n\r\n[405] The remark is Rossi's, and, though strongly controverted by\r\nCarducci, appears to me absolutely true.\r\n\r\n[406] 'Comedia pastorale di nuovo composta per mess. Barth. Brayda di\r\nSummariva,' Torino, Coloni da Saluzzo, 1556. Carducci, 64^{2}.
